<p>時評</p>
<h3>論統一</h3>
<p>— 起</p>
<p>祇要是中國人。誰都馨香禱祝着我們國家的統一。那理由鄙太明顯了。太簡單了。就是幼童稚子。也都想得出來。尤其是近來。正如上海各界統一救國大同盟宣言所説。“國難正深。危機日迫。實非完成眞正之統一。無以救國。”要之。統一之必要。其義如日中天。毌庸我們贅述。想在這裏提起的。是和統一有關的幾層意思。</p>
<p>近二十餘年來。揭櫫統一之義者並不自今日始。在不久的過去。就有人主張武力統一。而且這種主張。還會局部地暫時地見諸實行。結果怎樣。所謂統一的局面衹似曇花一現。好景不長。原因很易明白。端在這樣的統一沒有建築在眞正的牢靠的基礎上。我們要曉得。人與人間的聯繫是以生活共同的目標。共同的要求為其樞紐。教訓與勸賞的力量在這裏頗得很小。得其共同的生活目標與需求。雖億萬人無渙散之理。失其共同的生活目標與需求。雖二三人亦難期其同心。統一團結的眞正的基礎是在這裏。過去就因為有統一之表象而無統一之礎石。這樣的統一之局便似石上之花。雖得之。失之。前人之車。後人之鑒。根據以往事實的教訓。我們不但要強固統一的局面。更要強固統一的基礎。此其一。</p>
<p>我們現在談統一。切不應把視野縮小。忽視了我們統一動中一定要完成的主要目標。在我們國家的版圖上。到現時為止。有大塊大塊的領土已經不再隸屬戰們統一的主權治轄之下。例如冀東的偽自治組織與偽滿都是。這些反統一的畸形狀態不消除一天。我們可算一天沒有達到眞正統一的鵠的。而且。深一層觀察。這一步要是做不到。就是缩小範圍的統一運動恐怕也很難期其大成。我們的領土是整個的。我們的主權是整個的。有一部分受到損害時。自然會影響到整體。如此。我們所企求的是一個廣大的統一運動。而不是一個縮小了範圍的統一運。此其二。</p>
<p>在今天凡是中國人。都應該接受一個最高的救國原則。那便是民族的利害超過一切的利害。因為如果民族滅亡了。國家滅亡了。一切的利害都説不上。凡是中國人既然在着着以民族利害為前提的原則之下共同奮鬥。大家便得相互容忍。相互宽恕。抛棄無謂的紛爭。消除鬥戶的成見。各個人要具有這樣的態度。眞正的統一才會實現。在共同的生活目標與需求之下。大家固然會統一起來。團結起來。但是在這過程中。我們還須要努力。努力克服自己足以給予統一壞響的習性態度。我們一定要泯除成見。大公無私。與人推誠相處。大家懇擊地聯起手來。這是造成眞正統一的一個重要條件。此其三。</p>
<p>我們極端地擁護統一運動。以上只是補充的小小的意見</p>
<h3>日本議會宿將尾崎大逞詞鋒</h3>
<p>責政府對華缺誠意　與德締約大惑不解　軍人干政危機潛伏</p>
<p>［東京］衆議院議員尾崎行雄氏、為日本創設議會制度以來繼續當選之唯一議員、久守沉默、今日午後五時十分在衆院大會席上參加質問戰、關於立憲政治之本義及其運用、質問政府所信、同時披暦自己信念、會場空氣一時頗呈緊張、尾崎氏之雄辯如左、</p>
<p>㊀今後國防費之增大、與國民負擔之過重、謂係情出不已、請問其根據若何、</p>
<p>㊁至其不得已之理由、究由內至抑自外來、</p>
<p>㊂此項不得已之情勢、倘自外來者則是陸是海、請加以説明、</p>
<p>㊃無論自陸自海而來者、倘認為必須防禦、則日本一國亦未便担任、對於此事應請説明、</p>
<p>㊄既謂之國防、則当有假想之對手、是否具有與對方同籌或同籌以上之力量、</p>
<p>㊅余認為國防之安全感與充實軍備有所不同、政府之見解若何、</p>
<p>㊆日德協定之結果、究應若何、若謂目的在防禦共產主義、然則防共究有若何効力、日德協定德國方面有利、日本方面不能認為有利、日本外交方針究欲向何方發展、堅持任何外交方針、</p>
<p>又對蘇關係若謂非僅畏共產主義之波及、欲與之訂立互不侵犯條約、若訂約而彼破棄之、届時採取断然方針豈不可乎、</p>
<p>又最為重大之對華問題、而中國所備者、實未知日本外交所為何事、故應表示確切之具體方針、以此對華、則中國胸襟亦為之開、至於滿洲、則為日本賭國運於中日日俄兩大戰役面獲得者、是以中國雖云收復失地、亦不必與之計較、但滿洲問題以外之問題、當不至不能獲得協調、倘眞能實行中日親善、則不徒作口頭禪而出之以誠意、中國亦必欣然與我握手者也、</p>
<p>又所謂非常時期之語、現正流行、究竟何所指而云然、實不了解、歐洲眞遇危機、而東洋眞正之危機究在何處‵實無從考慮、滿洲事變後、國聯對日大呌其經濟絕交，而彼五十餘國對於日本有何能為、彼輩本國均處危局、自顧未遑、焉能對我、所謂隔岸觀火而今日之火還在隔印度洋之彼岸，故對外擴充軍備當無必要至於內部情勢、則日本帝國之內政確已遇其危機、林首相以次諸人固可打破內政之危機、且軍部方面偉人似非少數、非僅大臣、卽指導舆論之吾人積六十年之政治生活、尚未知有此種偉大人物以一當而指導一世者、誠未之聞也、倘以絕大之熱誠而指導政治者、則應脫去軍服挺身而來、吾人自當潔身聽其指導、若以集團之力或以武力為背景而許其容嘴於政治、則世上此種佳趣而毫無顧慮之事當屬罕見者也、</p>
<p>老將尾崎演説至此、達一小時又四十分、在拍掌聲巾降台、林首相作簡單答辯後、松山陸相答曰、</p>
<p>二三六事件實深惶恐、現正向肅軍邁進、此事之原因與動機、直率言之、當為青年將校不遵皇命　貿然决行者也、换言之、政情之腐敗與墮落是也、余决不以彼輩行動為是、彼輩行動之動機、則應視為他山之石者頗非淺鮮也云云、　　午後七時七分散會、（十七日同盟電）</p>
<h3>昨日下午質問情形</h3>
<p>［東京］十七日之衆院大會、因有尾崎行雄出馬之消息傳出、故傍聽席無立錐之餘地、議員亦極緊張、午後一時十五分開會、卽開始向國務大臣之質疑、由政友之松村光三登壇、</p>
<p>產業統制問題</p>
<p>謂一般之產業、須始終以民營為原則、如產業國有之國家社會主義則殊不可、如前閣之電力管理案應徹回之、林內閣之產業指導精神、究竟何在、日本之大體政策其由來亦不外原料資源之獲得與產業之自山確立而已、有參加世界資財再分配之世界經濟會議之準備乎、將日“滿”兩國打成一片之產業統制機關尚付缺如、政府有設帝國經濟會議之意乎、馬楊前藏相之匯兌管理法、招外國之疑惑、與國內以動搖、結城藏相有於七月三十一滿期之日撤廣該法之意乎、政府對於將來之物價作如何之觀察、結城藏相答㊀為確立日“滿”經濟統制起見、擬運用日滿經濟委員會、㊀所以削减燃料国策費者、為再检討帝國燃料公司案之故、㊀貿易行政機構改革案擬提出於本屆議會、正在研究、㊀物價騰貴之原因、固有通貨問題、然日本之通貨依日本銀行之處置、膨脹不致如是之甚、故無惡性膨脹之慮，㊀匯兌管理令實施之結果、現在對於二三之投機輸入業者雖有多大之不便、然對於一般輸入業者尚無不利之處、故目下無撤銷此令之意、㊀物價騰貴對策、不欲採過於人為的手段、當檢討各種之原因、講適當之對策、而維持物價之平淮、</p>
<p>林首相答、</p>
<p>對於產業雖感有加以適切統制之必要、然無將各種產業改歸國營之意、資源再分配之世界會議、各有機會當欣然參加、闡明政府之所信、</p>
<p>今從對滿政策</p>
<p>昭和會之守尾榮夫氏關於對滿政策、提出質問後、松山陸相答辯如左、</p>
<p>“滿洲國”之現狀認為非以兵力、尚不能維持治安結城兼拓相答—</p>
<p>欲使“滿洲國”得到健全之發達、非僅為農業移民必須使各種優秀國民多數移住、余對於此事亦有同感、</p>
<p>林首相答—</p>
<p>對滿政策須與治安對策平行、為得人和而安民心計、當以建設撫民對策為必要、</p>
<p>河上質問四點</p>
<p>其次由社會大衆黨之河上文太郎質問、大致謂最近日本為各種暗雲所遮蔽、要皆潛在於二二六事件之經過中、余認為應將此間之經過報告議會、靜候闕民之裁判、當為肅軍之捷徑、軍部當局之見解若何、又謂宇垣大將之組閣、有認為係妨害肅軍者、究竟肅軍現已進至若何程度、軍部當局動輒稱為肅軍起見、對於日本勞動聯合會員強求脫離、此乃自無憲法上之自由、</p>
<p>軍部會發得小冊子、提倡救濟農村、以期確立廣義國防、但昭和十二年度預算完全與此項主張相反、軍部當局對於急迫之農村、有無讓出一部分預算之意、至察及修正之預算、則直接稅輕而間接稅重、此為加徵之根本方針乎、果爾則结城藏相为犧牲農村而擁護日本資本主義、卽其金融資本家之代辦人也、所謂結城財政·卽結城加以池田財政是也、五一五事件直接引誘之收買美元大家、迄今尚在、實為日本資本主義將來之重大關鍵也、世上呼為金融法西斯蒂之結城藏相、倘認為信念不如此、則請直率大膽表明其見解為盼、</p>
<p>舉國一致、當此國難乃為克服時艱之第一方策、首相是否擁有與衆共議政治而行政之信念、雖不得而知、但庶政一新之根本意義、余認為須將帝國議會之權限擴充而強化之、首林之所信若何、</p>
<p>松山陸相答—</p>
<p>二二六事件尚未審議完竣、故未便報告共經過、他日尚有盡情報告之機會也、宇垣大將之組閣、並無加以妨害之事實、陸軍業經推薦適任人員、但本人未肯授受、解散勞動聯合會係根據陸軍獨自之要求、以便肅軍者也、削減軍費別亳無此意、</p>
<p>結城藏相答—</p>
<p>日本帝國現今迫於國防之急務、而國防之根幹尤以人為重、在此意義之下、安定國民生活實為最要、在同樣立埸擴充生產亦有必須、振興海外貿易亦為必要之圖、以此等情勢為根幹、而樹立財政之策、余認為非如此不可、余並非擁護資本主義者、卽在預算修正案中削減消費稅、較之削減直接稅者為大、於此亦可明瞭云、</p>
<p>林首相答—</p>
<p>尊民意、順輿論、以期運行公明之政治、業在政綱上述明、自當與國民實行庶政一新者也、（同盟電）</p>
<h3>日醞釀新政潮</h3>
<p>政黨反軍部態度不變　政友因總裁問題內訌</p>
<p>［東京］日本之新政潮、刻正在醞釀中、衆院昨日開會時、提出許多反對陸軍之冗長質問後、陸相杉山元將軍與陸次今井等諸領袖、卽於散會後、在會議休息室中集議、聞彼等决議對衆院反對陸軍之悄緒、取強硬態度、而置一月二十三日廣田內閣傾覆之前鑒於不顧、各政黨現仍竭力反對陸軍、顯抱謀使陸軍與海軍及全國分離之決心、觀察家預料、茍非政黨變更策略、陸軍不日復將提出解散議會之要求、（中央社十七日路透電）</p>
<p>［東京］政友會內之革新派在鈴木總裁表示辭職之機會、要求立卽設立代替總裁之機關、開始猛然運動、企圖驅逐幹部派、鳩山一郎等接近鈴木總裁之一派認設立代行機關為鈴木總裁留任之前提條件、卽據政友會黨規、會內必置總裁而於必要時總裁得隨時設立代行機關、故現在設立之代行機關、不免有暫時性質、總裁辭職後、應以現在總務為中心、出幹部處理一切黨務、幹部派如此意見、與革新派完全衝突、革新派方面擬改正黨規成臨時蔑視黨規、主張設立代行機關、而有必要時不辭黨部分裂與幹部派相關、由此觀之、政友會暫以設立代行機關為中心繼續紛亂、（十七日同盟電）</p>

<h3>英政府公布國防計劃白皮書</h3>
<p>加緊擴充海陸空軍備　五年內需費十五億鎊</p>
<p>［倫敦］政府頃發表白皮書、內容就國防程序有所説明、並規定軍事上大規模革新辦法共要點如下、㊀下屆糾財政年度內、海軍建造主力艦三艘、巡洋艦七艘、又航空母艦兩艘．㊁陸軍添設坦克車營．㊂增多空軍人員、㊃在本部及各自治領添開飛機場多處、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英政府今日所發表之白皮書、估計五年以內之國防及軍備費用、將達十五萬萬鎊、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於英國政府向議會提出擴充軍備增強國防事、白皮書已於今晚公佈、內載全部國防計劃甚詳、該白皮書稱、政府雖請求授權舉債四萬萬鎊、但此數亦無需完全用罄、惟在此後五年之中全部國防費用、依據最審愼之估計、至少需欵十五萬萬鎊、而所謂全部費用者卽五年中尋常概算之數、再加以四萬萬鎊之國防公債是也、該白皮書復提出此項新計劃必須施行之理由、得近年以來、世界各國軍備中之機械設備、在精密上已見無限量之增加、且最新設備及防空器械之需要固各國同之、而英國之領域四散分佈極遠、本國所需求於海外之供給、必須由海道轉運而來、凡此種種、均着重於英國之軍力、海軍以必需維持交通之安全、尤屬責任重大、而英帝國各屬地軍事重要地點防禦之近代化、亦屬國防計劃最主要之一項、白皮書次復圣於陸海空軍各個之需要、一一加以敘述、次論及後備製造廠之容量及本國與海外之防守問題等、並稱、刻英國所需要者、卽各項問題應以富有伸縮之辦法應付之、庶此後國際間情勢變換之後、或科學研究與發明加緊施用之時、能立卽加以變更、以求與環境相適應、</p>
<p>關於海軍一項、書中稱、在此後數年之中、國家有不得不施行重大建築計劃之需要、除現在在建築中之八百萬鎊之主力艦二艘外、在一九三七至一九三八年之程序中、復須增築三艘、本年計劃中復將增建巡艦七艘及飛機母艦兩艘、自一九三一年起至一九三四年中、海軍建築程序每年平均數約在一千二百萬鎊之下、惟至一九三六年已增至五千萬鎊、而本年所需、尤將有急劇之增加云、</p>
<p>陸軍方面擬再組縱坦克車二團、及相當輔助軍力、俾完成近代軍力、使能在戰場上作有效力之應付、並依據改進陸軍狀況之新計劃、維持費用佔據鉅之數字、而各部份之機械化、亦在加緊進行之中、圣於軍用品之大量存儲亦有相當計劃、俾戰事發生後數月之中、生產力尚未能增加之前、軍需資源不致斷絕、</p>
<p>關於空軍方面、白皮書主張增築大量機場、並擬在國內外各地點增築活動訓練及其他空站七十五所、現英國空軍人數、已自一九三四年之三萬一千人增至一九三六年之五萬人、此數復須有極大之增加、</p>
<p>白皮書中復有建築軍需軍用品潛伏存儲之計劃、以備不時之急需、此外復有所謂陰翳飛機製造廠者、可於緊急之時供給大量飛機、再則國營工業其與國防有關者、亦應設法使其不致因主要原料斷絕而廢置、故主要品之存儲如燃料等皆需資甚鉅者也、</p>
<p>關於本國防守計、劃該白皮書載英國原有之領土軍二師、現已改組擴充、並將在各領土軍新兵募集地點增築領土軍團部若干所、此外則氣球掩護隊、亦正在增造氣球之中、民衆之保護如防毒面具之供給、救火器械之增加、皆屬防禦燒夷彈危險之重要工具、故均已在籌劃之中、至海外各根據地之防守，應增加防空之設備、各海外要港之高射砲及探海燈等設備之增加、均屬保護所需、而國內外海岸防守力之近代化、皆動需鉅資者云、</p>
<p>該白皮書稱、“自政府開始擴充軍備之計劃以來、與此項計劃之範圍及速率有關之外間環境、迄今尚未見改善之朕兆、故政府認為在此現象之中、軍備建築之計劃一時尚未可减少或遲緩”云、</p>
<p>該白皮書繼續、政府深信此種擴充軍備之計劃、於和平前途大有裨益、凡屬國民均應竭力加以贊助、故“英皇之政府雖對於此種軍備及其他防守計劃所需要之費用至抱遺憾、但確有不得不實行之覺悟、政府半因當前環境之壓迫、半因以往若干年來政府在國防上所需要於財政者較少、故今日有不得不急起直追之勢、惟以五年短期中彌補此項缺點之全部擔負、據加於在此時期內納稅者之肩、旣覺礙難實行、復覺殊欠公平而英皇政府之所為慰者、在提議將此項費用之一部分、攤諸較長之時期、深覺其循行之途徑、實充分純正也、”該白皮書復愼重聲明、在國防實力能恢復其安全水準之前、此計劃必需施行之、（中央社十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>巴黎同情</h3>
<p>［巴黎］今日巴黎人士感覺英國國防之偉大努力、定可發生有益之効果、英國不欲使海洋自由從成空語之行動、現受法人之歡迎、英國之軍備程序、雖表示其僅能以至少數之軍隊置入疆場、惟其使軍火有巨大準備之方案、巴黎稱之為深謀遠慮之戒備、（中央社十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>羅馬驚訝</h3>
<p>［羅馬］英政府下大决心、彌補其軍備之缺點、意人對之、印象甚深、且以其所需之經費、為數頗巨、為之驚訝不置、皆覺英法兩國現正將軍備競爭提至至高之程度、而使較貧之列強望塵莫及、意人今皆以軍備競爭繼續進行所臻之程度為懼、（中央社十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>柏林疑懼</h3>
<p>［柏林］德政府發言人今日評論英國之軍備程序、謂德國並不否認英國將其軍備擴張至其所視為必要的程度之權利、僅要求德國亦應享此同樣權利耳、惟德國深信英國之地位、遠不若德國之危險、今乃若是大舉擴張其軍備、殊不解其意旨何在、故政界今皆互問曰、“凡此舉動、將達到何種地步乎、意法蘇俄等國、其將不步英之後塵乎”、（中央社十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本關心</h3>
<p>［東京］日本海軍界人士自英國公布擴充軍備計劃之後、已自承其極為關心、並將切實注意此後之發展、彼等對於英國之决定增築主力戰艦三艘及巡艦七艘認為係德國海軍擴充之反響、並預料美國此後亦必將施行擴大計劃以與英國計劃相抗衡、但日本之海軍並無與英美求均等之企圖云、同一方而復稱、日本之目的、僅在以不受威協不施侵略為原則之獨立恭礎上充實其軍備、惟日本之軍力、必須能對於遠東和平及太平洋西部職權之維持應付裕如、惟所謂軍備者、僅有共相對之價值、今英國既舉行鉅大之建築計畫、而美國勢將追踪而前、則日本將來或將受環境之壓迫而不得不急起直迫云、（中央社十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>英國防公債案提出下院</h3>
<p>昨開始辯論</p>
<p>［倫敦］自英政府白皮書公佈之後、英國國防費鉅大支出、遂成為議會休息室談話之重要資料、政府方面深信此項偉大之策略、必能得擁擭政府者普通之贊助、但反對派則覺賦稅之大增、將為不可避免之事、因而表示悲觀、關於此議案之辯論、今日卽將關始、為時兩日、屆時財相張伯倫將提出關於國防公債之決議案、並聞勞工黨最重要之非難、將為白皮書中對於國防、並未提出任何調節計劃云、（中央社十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>美中立案</h3>
<p>勢將提早通過國會　海軍保持對英均等</p>
<p>［華盛頓］英國籌募國防巨額經費一舉之影嚮、將使美國會提早通過中立議案、國會議員多謂假使無驚恐之英國若是大擴隊備、則歐洲局勢必確有爆炸性、非官場各界皆料美國海軍將繼續維持其與英國均等之地位、惟在美政府與鋼業製造家目前爭案之報告未發表之際、大約不致宣布此種决議、按自鋼業製造家停止以鋼料供給美海軍造船廠後、美國造艦程序、已為暫告停顿矣、（中央社十六日路邊電）</p>
<h3>英皇加冕後鮑爾溫傳將引退</h3>
<p>由張伯倫繼任揆席</p>
<p>［倫敦］羣衆初信首相包尔溫將留职、至議會夏季休會終止之时、但政界今皆一致以為包氏在英皇加冕後卽將辭职、幾可預决、又樞密院大臣麥唐納與法相海爾珊子爵亦有乞休之意、海爾珊因上年體常不適、麥唐納則因患目疾頗感不便、如包氏辭職、則財相張伯倫將繼其任、自不必言、惟財相一職將屬何人、衆説紛紜莫衷一是、海相賀爾內相西門似最有望、第衆皆以為西門將晉封貴族而繼海爾珊為法相、果爾則商相作錫曼有入財部之可能、其為人甚穩健、且為衆所愛西門若掌財政將牽涉特別問題、故恐不能實現、閣員之將更動者、豫料尚有陸相古柏與勞工大臣自朗二人、衆並料如麥唐納告退、則張伯倫將羅致國民工黨一員入閣、以維持內閣學國一致之性質、今唯一可决者、张伯倫成竹在胸、凡其所欲為者、自將有甚明白之動議也、（中央社七日路透電）</p>
<h3>不干涉西班牙內戰調整會工作進展</h3>
<p>通過小組會兩決議案　禁志願兵本星期六起實施　海陸監察計畫葡提出保留</p>
<p>［倫敦］不干涉西班牙內亂調整委員會、今日午後舉行全體會議、當將小組委員會日昨决定两案、予以通過、卽㊀禁止志願兵派往西班牙辦法、定於本星期六日、卽本月二十日起、實行生效、㊁不干涉辦法之監察計畫、定於三月六日起、實行生效、本日會議、歷時頗短、德代表卽駐英大使里質特羅浦、首先發言、宣布德國接受上項辦法、嗣由意代表、卽駐英大使格闌第發出同樣宣言、並用譏諷口吻、述及英國各報所載消息、（卽謂關於禁止志願兵辦法、所由成立協定者、係因法代表在小組委員會中、表示強硬態度之故）倘代表蒙德羅繼格闌第發言、對於禁止志願兵辦法表示接受、但對於實施監察計畫一節、則提出保留案、關於此層、樂觀者、以為葡國僅將暫時置身事外、一俟監察計畫實行之時、終當參加其事、特悲觀者則謂、葡國對於監察計畫、恐將始終保持反對態度云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>瑪德里東南一場惡戰</h3>
<p>叛軍三度猛攻　均被守軍擊退</p>
<p>伐倫西亞　據西班牙政府方面消息、瑪德里東南廣二十哩陳錢之大戰、現已入於第二星期、瑪德里似將成第二凡爾登、政府宣稱、叛軍在已往劇日之大戰中、死傷之數達六千人、大戰刻右俯瞰阿根達橋之高原進行、政府軍現仍堅守該橋、據政府軍所得之照片觀之、死傷之叛軍中共有德人二千名、同時聞比斯開陣线數處由地之雙方防兵、每夜輒會集環繞營火唱歌行樂、與瑪德里陣线之军隊苦樂大相縣殊云、（中央社十七日路透電）</p>
<p>瑪德里　國民軍昨在玛德里东南面哈拉瑪城一帶、連續進攻三次、攻勢殊為猛烈、但均為政府軍所擊退、逆料政府軍、當於本日舉行反攻國民軍昨日三次進攻、情形如下、第一次國民軍先以砲隊轟擊、歷時甚久、翤卽以坦克車衝鋒、而由步兵隊機之突進、各該步兵隊均使用自動軍器甚為犀利、雙方戰聞、歷兩小時之久、猛烈異常、但政府軍屹然不動、原有陣地、未有變化、未幾、國民軍久舉行第二次進攻、但此次未有坦克車衝鋒、卒被政府軍所掃擊、而未得逞、國民軍當卽整頓部隊、作第三次進攻、但其結果又被擊敗、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>瑪港空前浩刦雖民顚沛流離</h3>
<p>伐倫西亞　西班牙司法部長奧利凡氏、奉政府之命、發表報告、敘述瑪拉加居民十萬給人為選叛軍逃至阿爾米利亞時所受之痛苦、奧氏稱、此次避難場稱歐洲歷史上未有之人類浩刦、常難民在逃往阿爾米利亞之途中、曾受軍艦之砲轟·飛機之炸擊·坦克市上機關槍之掃射、沿途死屍枕藉、難民多人因步履維艱、先將其兒女縊殺、以免落於法西斯黨徒之手、繼乃以首觸石而死、或臥於道中、為載重汽車輾斃、並有許多兒童與其父母相失、而為羣衆踐踏殞生、另有若干難民因力不能舉步、乃作膝行、其過處輙留有血跡、加以飲食奇缺更增痛苦、難民旣抵阿爾米利亞、因不能兌得宿處、多臥於道左云、（中央社十六日路透電）</p>
<p>阿維拉　按之最後消息、政府軍在退出瑪拉加港之前、曾槍决人犯達一萬餘人之多、該港自入國民軍手中、居民衣食兩項均感匱乏、已有輪船多艘滿載衣服糧食開抵該港、以資接濟、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>國際聖餐會在菲舉行</h3>
<p>— 菲律賓通信</p>
<p>加入五十餘國代表赴會甚衆　菲移民部竟阻礙我代表登岸　駐菲總領事已向移民部抗議</p>
<p>菲律賓為東方惟天主教國、蓋受西班牙三百年政治之管轄、與教化之熏陶、除南方少數回教教族外，餘均為天主教徒、現在總統與副總統及政界要人、皆信仰天主教、私立大學、如聖道瑪·雅典：聖迷撈·撈撤等、具有數百年或百數十之歷史、皆為各教院僧侶所設立、至在東方教士階級、亦以菲鳥為最尊、計有宗座代表一、總主教二、主教十、副主教一、牧監二、本屆國際聖餐大會、在菲島首都岷里刺舉行、因菲律賓為新興國、而且交通利便、商業發達、氣候溫和、風景秀麗、兼有天時地利也、</p>
<p>該會原訂二月三日開幕、在新乘凉地建設偉大會場、可容十萬人坐位、設備費近十萬元，場中縣數百盞鉅熖電燈、掛數十架播音機、自三日下午開幕、至七日下午閉幕、每天夜半一時後、各信徒皆赴各教區行彌撒禮、至早晨六時下午六時、則皆赴大會埸行大彌撒禮、訂四日為婦女日、五日為男子日、六日為兒童日、七日為大衆祝福日、舉行遊行時、有十餘萬信徒加入、每次開會因信仰上約束、皆靜穆嚴肅、諸善信有長跪一二小時、以接受諨音者、在未開會以前、各城區及鄉鎮古色斑斕之禮拜堂、情髹漆一新、又得政府極力提倡、在開會期間、各機關各學校、皆停止半日辦公、居宅窗前、各大街道電燈桿、皆掛美菲國旗及會徽隨風飄揚、各汽車倘插美菲小國旗及會徽、馳驅於大道康衢中、各教徒則以盛會難逢、更興高彩烈、任意開消、在所不惜、故大會場中近演講臺之六人坐位、有訂至五百菲幣者、</p>
<p>在素住二十餘萬居民之岷里刺、忽增犬批旅客近五六萬人，（各外省教徒亦多來首都朝聖）種種食品、求過於供、酒樓茶館、無論大小場面後至者卽無立足地、而尤以旅館業、更無法推廣至適當需要、故由歐洲開來意艦、由美洲開來俄國皇后船、由厦門開來安慶船、由爪哇開來十二港船、皆特泊港內四五天、作諸代表團臨時旅社、待閉會後、各代表國卽就原船回國、其艙位為優待起見、聞皆特別减價、</p>
<p>我國代表、若上海陸伯鴻·南京于斌等、在天主教中品級甚高、賜有爵位、在未到時、郭順總統會函請甚下榻總統府為上賓、不料一月二十日、同各國代表首一日到岷里刺時、於七點半抵碼頭、我駐菲總領事及華僑歡迎團到碼頭歡迎他國代表皆高視闊步、揚長登岸、獨我國陸于諸代表、移民部欲留在新客拘留所、查騐護照並審問口供、然後放行、否則每人須一千元擔保金、經總領事再叫交涉、並聖餐籌備會總主任出為證明、亦不得移民部之原諒、由七點半遲延至九點半、結果、由總領館名交暫時擔保上岸上帝以平等博愛為宗旨、我國代表、偏受此不平等待遇、誠使僑胞痛心於國際地位之低落也、</p>
<p>此籌關係國際地位之事、自不容輕易放過故事後總領事再函移民部提出交涉、大體上分為兩點、㊀中國朝聖團團員執有第六項入境證書、經美領事嚴密查明、何以每名尚須勒令交一千元之擔保金、實属過份而悖理、㊁干陸諸代表為天主教高級領袖、險執有上海美領事之簽發證書外並穿懸較袍徽章、表示其在教會職位崇高、又經聖餐头會籌傭處代表認明、而尚須阻難兩小時之久查美國拒絕華人入境之精神、僅在拒絕華工、華人旣執有相當證書、而非工人、卽不應阻其登岸、且于陸等職位甚高、亦應受相當敬禮云、</p>
<p>總之、自移民局移交勞工部管理圣華童入境大事挑剔、不圖竟辱及關係國際地位之我國代表團、可見菲人聲聲與我親善、改善移民待遇、（實在現移民律益加嚴厲）是表面上敷衍耳、</p>

<h3>滬華人足球隊昨敗於港聯</h3>
<p>結果六比零滬隊今日赴廣州</p>
<p>中央計審港十七日電滬華人埠際足球隊、十七日下午四時、與港聯隊作表演比賽於加路連山球場、渭隊因李甯等受傷未出場、陣綫零落、上半時迭被小告山奴李安納拖拔射進四球局勢成一面倒、下半時港隊胡禮攻陷一城後、竟由門將羅闌士主踢十二碼罰球、再登一記、結果零比六、渭隊慘敗、該隊定十八日赴省作表演者、</p>
<p>（香港特訊）第一屆滬港華人埠際足球賽、於十四日下午三時半在加路運山球場舉行、球迷觀戰者異常擁擠、統計約有八千餘人之譜、情形異常熱鬧、是日天氣嚴寒、冷風刺骨、足迷觀戲者未見有畏縮之狀、戰情平淡、乏精彩表演、上海隊因陳鎮和·孫錦順·李義臣等不睱抽身爾來、實力異常簿弱、竟不堪一擊、致以一比五之成績、遭香港隊／慘敗、上海隊是日表演失常、觀其實力、不及本港尋常乙組之長勝軍海軍隊也、兹將比賽戰情紀錄如下、</p>
<p>作戰經過</p>
<p>時屆葉九皐出場執法，港隊揮軍進攻、然因過於客氣、良久未開紀錄、黃美順眼看不過迭放冷矢、向滬隊威脅、未幾、李惠堂乘張滿榮傳球之便、出二十碼外、將球盤定、命射中的先聲奪人、詎港隊勝後、又不進取、卓石金且負傷離塲、由楊水益替補、爾來我往、遂为滬隊所乘、許竟成見機而作、用高射砲向前方輸送、譚江柏本擬躍高救球、詎包家平慌忙過甚、出而搶險、反身不及、遂為難斗文衝進一只、成一比一、其後張滿榮楊水益各建一功、港隊遂以三比一佔先、</p>
<p>休息過後、下半場繼續作戰、張榮才大顯身手、擋過黎兆榮斜射後、一個鴿子翻身、又將楊水益所射之球擋出、頗獲好評、未機李惠堂破關直進迭過重防、張榮才出而搶救、李乃演出生平絕技、將球挑過張榮才、潦淮綱寫、戴麟經不住雌伏、大舉反攻、詎為譚江柏所阻、終難見效、旣而劉始讚在禁地犯規、黃美順主踢十二碼罰球、球中張榮才反彈而出、美順乃趨前績射又告中的、其時李甯許竟成相繼負傷離場、山蔣紹祥王克厚替補、各無所獲、港隊遂以五比一奪擭本届錦標、</p>
<p>歡宴情形</p>
<p>當晚八時、本港華人體育協進會、假廣州酒家、舉行　　大會、到者除主方協會委員長蔡惠鴻、副委員長謝雨川、前委員長顴成坤、及各委員、及主賓全國協會代表蔣湘青、各隊員一行外、有本港足球總會主席文拿氏、東華醫院主席、保良局首總理、及各界人士百餘人、酒過主巡、蔡惠鴻致詞歡迎、蔣氏致詞答謝、至十時許始盡歡而散、</p>
<h3>上海籃球委員會議</h3>

<p>上海籃球會委員會於今晚六時半、假座四川路大中華酒樓開會、對論會內一切重要事宜、會員余衡之·張國動·陳昺德·黎寶駿·凌希陶·沈昆南六君、均希撥冗蒞臨共策進行云、</p>
<h3>中青籃球今日秩序</h3>
<p>美最時對五騎（商四）五時半　章華對商工（商二）　六時一刻</p>

<h3>上海籃球會甲組甲部辛隊奪得錦標</h3>
<p>昨三九比三四勝麥令甲　麥令乙得甲組乙部冠軍</p>
<p>辛隊昨以三十九比三十四擊敗麥令甲、完成上海籃球會甲甲組秩序、以五戰五勝之成績、榮膺錦標、昨晚之戰、表演輕巧·。頗饒興趣、辛隊因皆南部耀雅出任中鋒、為得勝主因、麥令則因過分小心、而洛克·勃利齊二人、又被嚴密監視、全隊失去重心、而少獲分機會、在技術上昨日之辛隊、確在麥令之上成績如下、</p>
<p>上海籃球會回復旦暨南兩強隊之不參加、辛隊乃招致該兩隊中之重要份子、早具奪標决心、加以信通放棄錦標觀念敷衍門面、是以麥令與辛隊成為對峙局面卒以辛隊陲容鞏固、表演生動、獲取寶座、</p>
<p>現甲組秩序、尚餘麥令對五龍一場决定亞軍名次、形勢如下、</p>
<p>辛隊麥令之戰、八時牛開賽、中國觀衆約三百餘人、自問達雲打開紀錄後、麥令頗示活躍阿派達加屢次中的、五分鐘內以七比四佔先、馮念華州擲兩中、以八比七超出、康登亦還二球、又成十一比八、使辛隊暫時屆代固達雲再造優勢（十二比十一）、轉瞬間又失去三分、在極力掙扎中、成十四比十四、及十六日十六馮念華罰中一分後、辛隊從此躍登衾席、上半時以二十三比十八勝</p>
<p>再戰聲中麥令頗見振作、惟後衛得球後之死樣活氣、徐步前進之態、使比賽减小热烈情趣更以篮下防衛森严、活勸不得而辛隊進退迅速、籃下衝馳、亦甚動人明眼人已可揣測最後之勝負矣、故麥令雖逞一時之能、終少得分機會、除一度成二十九比二十七之接近比數外、辛隊常以五六導前、二十八日三十三時、為辛隊獲分最亘之周偉雲、難以四次犯規罰出、而麥令終未能掀起波浪、平反局勢、終以三十四比二十九仍以五分受挫焉、</p>
<p>麥令乙隊昨以四十八比二十四勝鷹隊、上半時為三十一比八、該隊以六戰六勝、完成甲組乙部錦標、</p>

<h3>上海實騐小學概况（一）</h3>
<p>— 本報特訊胡祖蔭調查</p>
<p>上海實騐小學共有兩所：一所係由江蘇省政府教育應設立，名為江蘇省立上海實騐小學；一所係山上海市政府社會局設立，名為上海市立實騐小學、本文敘述江蘇省立上海實騐小學各種設施概况：市立實騐小學概况將另為文介紹·筆者承省立上海實騐小學校長盛朗西先生多方供給材料，並蒙賜贈該校概况撮要一份，特此誌謝。</p>
<p>一·辦學沿革</p>
<p>江蘇省立上海實騐小學創辦於前清光緒癸卯年（卽民元前八年）正月，至今已有三十四年的歴史。那時，上海縣邑紳季會珂，姚文構諸人籌集經費，在上海縣城二十二舖的愍宗，劉公二祠開辦小學一所，名為二十二舖小學堂·由買季英，楊月如一位先生任主任·開學的第一天，僅到學生二十七人。</p>
<p>兩年以後，江蘇松太道開辦龍門師範學堂，將二十二舖小學堂改為附小，名曰龍門師節學堂附屬小學堂·民國元年三月，龍門師範學堂改稱江蘇省立第二師範學校，該校亦改稱江蘇省立第二師範附屬小學校；此時，山貿季英先生任校長，楊聘漁先生任主事。</p>
<p>民國三年五月，該校在尚文門內守府署舊址建築新校舍，乃將全校分為二部：穩尚文門內新校舍為第一部：西門內愍忠，劉公二祠舊校舍為第一部。民國十六年八月，省立二師與商專等校合併，改組為國立第四中山大學上海中學，該校遂改稱為國立第四中山大學上海中學實騐小學，任盛朗西先生為校長。嗣後該校幾次更改名稱，到二十三年七月才改稱江蘇省立上海實騐小學。同時，該校又在吳家巷建築新校會，增設第三部。</p>

<h3>去年華商糖業佳况</h3>
<p>全年銷數達三十四萬餘包　華北走私雖猖獗幸未影響</p>
<p>中央社云、去年華北走私猖獗私糖充斥、而本市正當華商之經營糖業者、於大結束時、反均告盈餘、統計一年度國產機產糖之銷數、已達三·四二八·三六包、記者特向本市糖業界探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>合組公司標價包銷</p>
<p>吾國久為巨量洋糖輸入國、佔入超之第二位置、糖市高下、向操諸香港洋商之手、自上海華商逕向各產地購買後、糖市由港移滬、前年粵桂糖廠成立、本市糖業鉅商興華行、召集全市糖商、組織合組公司標價包銷、如有銷售未罄者、均由興華行掃數包銷、上海遂成為推銷國糖之中心、其中如有不敷之時、再行購買洋糖、</p>
<p>組織有方糖市穩定</p>
<p>糖為日常需用品、關孫民食至鉅、本市各糖商、均不願同業相殘以共同團結之精神、合組公司去年春夏間、糖價日跌、滬埠貯積之國糖、達二十萬包、價值數百萬元、雖戲耗日損、但决不跌價推銷、以謀穩定糖市、此全賴組織有方、得免外人操縱、</p>
<p>津漢各地銷售暢旺</p>
<p>津漢蘇杭銷糖甚多、潮汕閩粤、則為產糖之區、而全國糖市之所以视上海為轉移者、以其遇知世界市况、且深悉各埠糖商之狀祝、先行交貨、訂期付欵、此為太古及日荷糖商所不敢為者、華商更抱定國糖銷售不佳時、始購買外糖、則國糖銷售暢旺、自所必然、</p>
<p>出產精良前途有望</p>
<p>現時我國粤桂東莞順德市頭三廠出品、已與舶來品相伯仲、惟惠陽·揭陽·新造·貴縣·四廠、則因機器關係、不免稍遜、如加以改進、則國糖前途、未可限量、去歲華北走私、國糖未受影響、純以合組公司及各糖商咸能提倡國產、不爭私利所致云、</p>

<p>逞勢要挟</p>
<p>謂如不出欵一千元、必須將氏帶下捕房、該氏恐怖異常、及與之談判、結果、由氏出欵四百元立給、若輩始退去、但施之親戚王壽山即在暗中尾隨、見若輩步行數武、竟雇坐黃包車向法租界方面而去、王心中大奇、以旣係公共捕房包探、何以入法租界、乃仍行暗隨、見彼等至愷自爾路永樂里、下車血入三號屋內、王</p>

<p>探詢何事</p>
<p>見有身穿大衣之一人、問施先生在家否、彼特來拜年我答不在、又問陳太太在否我以旣屬特來拜年、且係一人、遂開門邀入、不料後面有一西人及華人三人跟蹤入內、謂係捕房所派、到來搜查海洛英、因見施之姑母正在吃烟、若輩乃加要挟、圖詐一千元、後允给四百元、共餘之欵、容後續交、若辈乃携欵出門、我</p>

<p>其二、關於股東責任問題、查新公司仍為股份有限公司、依照公司法股東之責任、以共所執之股票為限、換言之卽不幸而新公司營業失敗、股東除失其股票之價值外、並無其他責任、今假定新公司不辦儲蓄、不收長期存欵、營業範圍、緊縮於幾種穩固而流動之信託業務、或銀行業務之下、不但股東不生責任問題、卽股東之被舉為董事或監察人者、茍不營私舞弊亦不生責任問題、何也、不辦儲蓄、則新公司為純粹之股份有限公司、雖在董監、亦不負連帶無限責任也、極而言之凡股東無意繼續營業、則隨時可將股苿脫售、隨時可將股東之權利莪務、一切完全續渡與人、而責任更不生問題矣（未完）</p>

<p>洋麥慘跌人心改變　塲內多空進出極盛</p>
<p>昨日粉市、各月份呈反跌甚暴之象、以洋麥報價、突趨慘落、如芝加哥近跌六角零、遠跌二一角、坎拿大近跌七角、遠跌五六角、利物浦跌一二便士、故開價時、以洋麥慘遭反動、業內外心思、一致改變、本月份開價跌至一角三分、較前日計跌七分二釐半、惟多頭競出、而廠方亦力補不已、故即回升二分、三四月份、多空進出、極度暢旺、初跌四五分、繼仍不振、七月份新粉、因外大户掉期、初開祗小一二分、後則廠方套出、亦趨軟弱、照目下情形、一半固基於洋麥之報價、而因籌碼變動、業外多頭之活躍、似均着眼於此云、</p>
<p>期現麥各跌六七分</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份、致呈鬆跌之象、因洋麥報價、續跌二三角至五六七角、及一二便士不等、目下市塲目標、大部分根據國外之報價、今見跌勢甚猛、　難再擯、居開價即跌六七分、後則交易轉淸、已少上落、傳近期標準、大多户係天津廠方、雖爲正式交易、但市值貨品、均不中式、所以亦近投機、不過籌碼吸住不放、故少生氣耳、現麥市面、因標凖洋麥均跌各檔喊價、亦跌六七分、開蚌埠洋河麥六元七角、江北麥六元六角半、統市見交八千餘包云、</p>
<p>西安帮動辦機靖米</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、到頭日有萬包左右、去化相等、市居定局、但存底尚充、後到亦湧、貨主大多急於求脱、因此市面反見軟弱無神、惟昨日客化尚活、除本街厦門之外、新有汕頭北洋問津、而久經停頓之西安帮、今已時局平靖、交通恢復、昨市亦復辦去機靖米六七百包、惟粤帮未辦、市面未克回好云、全日開出江西米八千三百九十四包、湖南米一千五百包、漢糙二百五十包、</p>
<p>過年米買足食米自無大宗去路</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到三十餘號、貨約六千四五百石、內薄稻計十四五號、本街以各户過年米買足、銷塲殊屬淸寂、僅以子尚有動辦、計青島天津等帮辦薄稻二千五六百包、故市况轉疲、厚粳價回落角半至二角、薄稻勉定、杜尖略軟、陰元無市、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各埠來源三十餘艘、市上各貨銷路較前市愈見淡弱、市價白粳又小一角左右、薄稻小角零、早稻貨稀、零胃尚可、價形和平、羊埠秈價小數分至一角外、杜尖平定、客尖疲勢、白元價小數分至一角、其餘各貨價呈下遊之勢、</p>
<p>洋莊芝蔴跌角半</p>
<p>黄豆亦挫落五六分</p>
<p>洋莊芝蔴因洋行仍無舉動、單靠中央信託局獨家問津、致市氣難以進展、昨日前後市共成交三百噸、價開十四元九角及八角半、比前市跌去一角半、現貨毛蔴祗由本街零星走化、計開毫州蔴五十包、睢溪口蔴七十包、行情尚無上落、黄豆被大連市續跌、榨油廠辦胃頓見緊縮、其他銷塲亦大减、所以市價即修五六分、共計做開蚌埠豆四車、西城豆一百五十二包、丁家州豆一百四十七包、沙黄八百包、杜豆二十四包、乍豆四百包而已、</p>
<p>大連一再報小標準油豆餅跌風亦猛</p>
<p>標凖油豆餅市、前以大連市面一度回振、人心稍見好轉、然連市疲頽難挽、旋即報跌、行號得訊較早、首先抛出、而昨日連電繼續狂落、人心更爲虎軟、行號續有暢出、故首盤開價、立即猛跌、標油鋭落六七角、蔴餅小二三分、標凖黄豆近小一角、遠月則跌小一角八分之鉅</p>

<h3>五金</h3>
<p>本廠元釘産不應銷</p>
<p>本廠元釘新近交易、因客帮多有指辦、同業存貨有限、以致不够分配、况廠方因原料缺乏、出貨淺薄、行情開出每桶爲十三元五角、比之紅盤加高五角、查開出有四五百桶之多、其他小花色行情因出貨不多、故市勢甚堅、如四分估十七元、五分十八元五角、六分二十元、但比貨終因花色冷門、所以開出不多、</p>
<h3>油市</h3>
<p>桐油業盈利不及前年厚</p>
<p>桐油爲吾國之特産、世界各國油漆廠之原料、無不仰給於我、故吾國之出口貿易至上年已躋第一位、而國內之産額、亦復年增一年、上年全國出口約計十萬噸以上、集中市塲雖在漢口、但各洋商深入川湘內地採辦者、數亦不少、本埠對外貿易全年約萬餘噸、自下半年實業部之植物油類廠成立後、出口之油均須由該廠提煉、在表面上似已集中、然洋商油廠依然提煉如故、而華商之從事斯業者、反多掣肘、未若洋商之自由也、故上年本埠桐油號家之獲利亦、未能如前年之厚、據該業中人云、恐今年更不及上年矣、兹將各號結餘紅利、列表於后、（從略）</p>

<h3>忠義施全</h3>
<p>— 如璧</p>
<p>忠義之士·是和漢奸不兩立的</p>
<p>北宋末年，金國的大兵佔了汴京，徽宗欽宗都被金國押到北方去了。一時天下大亂，一些忠義的好漢，不願投降金國，大家都跑到高山大林裏去做强盗。施全也在太行山上做了一個大王。</p>
<p>以後高宗登基，宋朝又保住了半個天下，任用了岳飛韓世忠這一些大將，與金國抗戰，一時頗有中興氣象，施全早已經聽見江湖上傳説岳飛的忠義名聲，現在又做了元帥，帶領大兵同金國打仗；這正是報國的好機會，施全便把自己的嘍囉點檢一番，投到岳元帥帳下，一同去做恢復失土，滌雪國恥的工作。</p>
<p>施全跟着岳元帥，東殺西戰，南征北討，剿滅了不少的叛逆，也同金國打了不少的仗。真是戰無不勝，攻無不克，殺得金兵聞名喪胆，望影心驚，提起岳家軍的大名，連小孩子都知道駭怕的。</p>
<p>誰知那時出了一個大漢奸，就是秦檜丞相。他原是被金國捉了去的，隨後放了出來，一直做到丞相，便老帮金國的忙，害自己的祖國。他極力主張同金國講和，不同金國打仗。可是岳元帥的主張剛剛同他的相反，因此他恨岳元帥不過。所以，正當岳元帥在河南朱仙鎭大敗金兵，凖備一直殺到北方，去搗金國的巢穴，同時北方的忠義豪傑也凖備接應岳家軍的時候，秦檜便假傳聖旨，連發十二道金牌，把岳元帥召進京城，誣陷在獄裏，接着又在風波亭上害了岳元帥父子三人的性命。</p>
<p>岳元帥被害死的消息傳到大營裏，大小三軍如同死了父母一樣，哭聲震地。將官們都説：「現在漢奸在朝廷上當權，一心賣國，我們捨死忘生打一些仗，有甚麽用？連岳元帥這樣的功勞，都被漢奸害死了，我們將來也免不掉的，不如留得性命回去，等有機會再來報效祖國，殺盡敵人罷。」</p>
<p>於是將官們多半散了，有的回家，有的仍然上山去當大王。</p>
<p>施全回到太行山上，終日悶悶不樂，只在想心事。他想：「我是中國人，應當盡忠國家；我受岳元帥大恩，也應當報答，也應當承繼岳元帥的志向。現在雖然一時不能够同金國打仗，不能殺盡敵人，但是把漢奸殺了，也是一樣。我應該到臨安去把秦檜殺死，替國家除一個大害，也替岳元帥報了仇。我應該這樣做，才不愧是一個大丈夫。」</p>
<p>施全想了幾天，越想越覺得應該去殺秦檜，就决定到臨安去幹這一件大事。他也不告訴别的弟兄，在一個出着大月亮的夜裏，悄悄下山去了。</p>
<p>施全在路上不用説是曉行夜宿，饑餐渴飲。到了臨安。他也無心賞玩景緻，便尋個客店寄宿。第二天，施全到街上買了幾色祭品，拿出城，尋個空地擺上，望天空磕了幾個頭。他是在祭奠岳元帥父子。</p>
<p>一面磕頭，施全一面禱祝道：「岳元帥，兩位小將軍，你們在生忠直，死後一定成神。施全到臨安來刺殺秦檜這奸賊，替國家除害，替元帥父子報仇，願元帥父子在天之靈，保佑施全這個，讓施全做成功這件大事。」</p>
<p>施全禱祝完了，立起身來，獃獃的望着天，眼裏不覺流下淚來。他站了一會，似乎想起甚麽，便趕忙拭乾了淚珠，收拾了祭品，順着西湖邊走，打算回城去。</p>
<p>事情太凑巧了。施全在路上聽見人説：「秦丞相到靈隱寺燒香去了，執事擺得真熱鬧呢！」并且説的人不止一個。施全聽了，連忙伸手到腰裏摸摸藏着的牛耳尖刀，刀在！他想：「這賊合死！我不必回城裏了，就伏在靈隱寺前面的大路上，等那奸賊回來，從那裏經過時，一刀結果了他，多爽快！</p>
<p>施全轉身向靈隱寺走去，走了不遠，便把手裏的祭在品扔在空地上好騰出手脚。走到隔靈隱寺不遠的地方，有一座橋，施全想：「這正是藏身的好地方。」</p>
<p>於是，施全便在橋下藏了，等秦檜回來。</p>
<p>原來秦檜自從害了岳元帥父子過後，自己心虚，一閉上眼，就看見岳元帥父子，害怕得了不得，便向夫人王氏説知，王氏便勸他到靈隱寺去燒香，懺悔懺悔。秦檜想想也對，就選擇這個日子，到靈隱寺裏去燒香。</p>
<p>在靈隱寺裏面，秦檜碰見一個瘋和尚，説話皮裏帶骨頭，把秦檜冷譏熱諷駡了一頓。這人既是瘋子，秦檜受了氣也不能發作，只好悶在肚裏。燒完了香，打道回衙。秦檜坐在轎子裏，這口氣還是悶着。</p>
<p>正走着，護衛們忽然看見橋底下伏着一個人，便來回秦檜道：「啟丞相，橋底下藏着一個人。」</p>
<p>秦檜正没好氣，正好拿這人出氣，便説：「必是一個賊，去拿來。」護衛們領了命，就去捉人。</p>
<p>施全伏在橋底下，遠遠看見丞相的執事，知道秦檜來了，身上的血立刻沸騰起來。但是心却十分安定，手把尖刀握緊，等秦檜轎子一攏，便好跳出來，一刀刺死這一個大奸賊！</p>
<p>誰知秦檜的輪子停着，護衛們却向着橋撲來。施全知道壞了，但是自己却不想逃走，反轉跳出來，等着拼命。</p>
<p>施全同秦檜的護衛們殺了幾個回合，刺傷幾個人，但是衆寡不敵，終歸被捉了，捉到秦檜的轎子面前去。</p>
<p>秦檜看見施全滿臉殺氣，只好仗着胆子問：「你是何人，來刺本官？」</p>
<p>施全圓睜怪眼，大聲喝道：「秦檜，奸賊，你聽着，老爺行不改名，坐不改姓，岳元帥部下大將施全便是。老爺弟兄們跟着岳元帥在戰塲捨死忘生，把金兵殺得大敗，正好趁勢收復失地，你這奸賊却假傳聖旨，把岳元帥父子誆去害了。奸賊，你受了兀朮甚麽好處，這樣出賣祖國，陷害忠良？真正没有心肝，我今天來殺你這奸賊，替國家除害，替岳元帥父子報仇。只可惜事不成功，有死而已…秦檜，奸賊，我活着不能把你碎屍萬段，死了也要變成惡鬼來捉你的魂魄！奸賊！奸賊！」</p>
<p>施全恨聲不絶，牙都咬碎了。秦檜却被駡得汗流浹背，老羞成怒，連聲説：「這是刺客，推去斬！推去斬！」</p>
<p>施全大聲道：「奸賊聽着！老爺是忠義漢子，不能讓你奸賊的刀砍到我頭上來！」又仰天大呌道：「岳元帥，兩位小將軍，施全事做不成功，跟着你們來了。」</p>
<p>施全兩膀一用力，從護衛們的手裏掙了出來，聳身一躍，向着橋頭一頭撞去，可惜一位忠義漢子，便這樣歸天去了。</p>
<h3>吕芬呵克（1632-1723）</h3>
<p>— 伍必雄</p>
<p>—第一位知道有微生物的人—</p>
<p>約在二百五十年前，有一個荷蘭人，名叫吕芬呵克（Antony　Leeuweuhoek），他是人類中第一個發現了一個人們未曾經歷過的世界。這世界是一羣成千成萬不同種類的小生物，時而爲害人類，竟足致人死命，時而造福人羣，在使人類致富的工商業中某幾部份簡直少不了它們。就人類的真正幸福而言，我們發現這麽一個世界，始終比發現一個新大陸或多島的海洋來得重要。</p>
<p>在談到這位微生物界鼻祖的事業之　，我們不妨先看看那時代各方面的情形：講到家庭，父親是握有無上的權威，子女在家庭中祗有絶對地服從，對於一切不許你懷疑如果你甘冒不諱，向父親提出些習俗，不許你懷疑的問題，那麽你那懷疑的態度可使吃一下着着實實地耳光，或許要被父親逐出家庭。社會呢，也是這個樣兒，對於傳統上的信仰和禮教，不許你説個「不」字，不許你提出抗議，甚至於不許你懷疑，否則就有凟神的嫌疑。那時歐洲一般人士正在開始掃蕩迷信，而身當其事者却不知道他們自己又是何等的愚妄啊！科學雖已萌芽，可是那時的科學都忽略了科學基本的「實騐」工作。「科學」，歸根究底不過是「實騐」，在「實騐」中加以精密的觀察和淸晰的思考；因爲這樣各種研究才有逐漸趨近真理的希望。可是塞凡土斯（Tervetus）因藐視習俗，擅自解剖一個屍體，竟遭受火刑；伽利略（Galilei）因他胆敢證明地球繞日而行，而身遭長期監禁之苦。他們一方面在破除迷信，而一方面對於這些努力破除迷信的功用竟這樣對待！這是當時的社會！這是當時的科學！</p>
<p>在這樣的世界中，吕芬呵克於一六三二年誕生在荷蘭的一個小鎭上。他早年喪父，完全靠他母親撫養成人。書念到十六歳就去跟外鄉的一個雜貨商做學徒，在學徒的生涯，還孜孜不倦地研究，店舖就成了他的學校。</p>
<p>二十一歳時，他回到故鄉，自己開了一片雜貨店，後來又做本鄉鎭公所的門房，就在這時他發生一種磨玻璃的怪癖。原來他曾聽人説過：如將很純净的玻璃謹愼地磨成透鏡，用它來看東西要比肉眼所見的大得多。二十一歳至四十歳的光陰完全化在這件工作上。這是他發現微生物的基本工作，没有這番努力，他是不會成爲微生物界的鼻祖的。</p>
<p>吕氏天資本不聰敏，性情又極熱拗，教育也受得很少，他只懂荷蘭文，而荷蘭人是那時一種被人輕視的土語，通行於漁夫，店夥和工人們，智識階級講的是拉丁文，吕氏對此却莫明其妙。一部用荷蘭文寫成的聖經是他全部的藏書。這是多麽值得注意！原來恰好這一種「愚昧」就是他的幸運；因爲隔離了他那時學者們的無意識，他所依靠的是他自己的眼睛，自己的思想，自己的判斷。</p>
<p>吕氏並不去買現成的透鏡，他覺得自己動手總比較好些。他學會磨水晶的方法，成績超過荷蘭磨水晶名手所磨的，直徑不到三公厘，但是它那平滑匀稱的樣子，真配得上説「神工鬼斧」，很小很小的東西，一放在它下面看起來，放大了不知多少倍，淸楚凖確令人咋舌，至於其他金屬附件也是他自己在鎔爐中鍊出來的。他在千辛百苦受盡親友冷譏熱諷的環境中，居然造成了最簡單最原始的顯微鏡。現在我們化幾百元就能買到一架高度的顯微鏡，把螺旋轉幾下，從透鏡下觀察種種物件，或許全然不知道這器械是怎樣造成的。吕芬呵克可不是這樣。</p>
<p>他一有時間，就用他的透鏡觀察一切東西，不管它是鯨魚的肌纖維，或是他自己手上的指紋。一根羊毛或兎子毛他能幾小時長久地看下去，看到一根細毛在他的透鏡下變成了粗條，他快樂得跳起來，他很謹愼地解剖一隻蒼蠅的頭；把它的腦刺在他顯微鏡的細針上，一面種，一面驚訝。他研究十二看不同樹木的横斷面，觀察植物種子的內部。他又看到蚤和蝨，這簡直使他快樂得發瘋。總之，吕芬呵克好像一隻小狗，不分好壞香臭，什麽他都去嗅嗅。</p>
<p>吕芬呵克研究的態度是非常謹嚴的，他是絶不輕下决斷的，他在没有把握之前，他是不著一字，不作一圖。他説：</p>
<p>『剛用顯微鏡看東西的人們，今天説，他們看到這個，明天説，他們看到那個，就是經騐豐富的觀察者也被惑住了。我爲這種觀察不知化去多少時間；但我愉快地工作着，不去顧慮那些説着「何苦這樣辛苦？這有什麽好處？」的人。我不爲這般人，單爲了愛真理的思想家寫些東西。』</p>
<p>他就這樣埋頭苦幹了二十年！</p>
<p>十七世紀的下半期，歐洲一般先知先覺者驚醒了，他們不再相信亞里斯多德的理論，也不盲從教主的聖言。他們像那荷蘭看門人一樣，非自己經騐或體會過的，不把它當作真正的學問看待。在英國有幾位富於革命性的科學家組織了一個秘密團體，從事新科學的開發。這團體就是後來聞名世界的皇家學會，那時團員中有科學化學的始創者勞勃脱波義耳和物理大師以撒克牛頓。（未完）</p>

<h3>「中國婚姻法綜論」評</h3>
<p>— 劉曼</p>
<p>張紳著　商務版</p>
<p>由於人類的性行爲的本能的要求和保種的自然法則，二性的結合，從原始時代就開始了的。在那時人類的智慧未開，和生活的簡單化，雖然没有像現在一樣的隆重的婚姻儀式，但也已具備了簡單的婚姻形態，即以男女二性的結合，共營永久的性生活，一方面適應生理的本能的要求，另一方面皈依人類保種的自然法則。到了以後，人類的生活形態日漸趨於複雜，人類的智慧也日漸趨於開化，在以前蒙昧時代所盛行的婚姻法則，到了現在自然不能適用了，這樣就從社會的風俗習慣和人類的進化的軌跡中孵化出一種新的婚姻形態，於是有什麽「聘則爲妻，奔則爲妾，」以及「自媒之女，醜而不信，」等等的婚姻法則，甚而至於竟有人出來，訂定婚姻儀式，由統治階級公布，庶民遵行。如周公之定六禮，就是一個最確實的例證。由於人類的進化過程的演變，和時代的不斷的遞嬗，這種二性結合的婚姻法則和形態，也隨着不同。到了科學昌明，文化發達的近代，這種二性的婚姻型態，也已形成了它的嶄新的樣式，和以前完全不同了。</p>
<p>歷史告訴我們：近代的婚姻制度和法則的形成，的確不是偶然的，自有他的淵源和沿革，我們爲了要研究人類的進化的軌跡，就不得不從婚姻的淵源和沿革中去研鑽，張紳先生所著的「中國婿姻法綜論」一書，就可以帮助你明瞭婚姻制度和法則的淵源和沿革，和認識人類的進化的軌跡。</p>
<p>這本「中國婚姻法綜論」一書，是從婚姻的社會現象説到法律現象，把婚姻的制度和法則，淵源沿革等，都闡釋得非常的淸晣，在緒論裏，共分五章，第一章導言，第二章婚姻制度之沿革，第三章婚姻之立法，第四章婚姻之本質，第五章婚姻的態樣與習慣。我們讀了這篇緒論，對於婚姻的觀念和史的發展就可以有一個充分明晣的概念。尤其在第五章裏婚姻之態樣與習慣，把歷來的婚俗都呈現在我們的眼底了，如重婚與再婚，血親婚，姻親婚，贅婚與童養，妍度，妾，招夫與典妻，早婚與不嫁等，使我們知道了一切婚姻的風俗習慣，及其演變過程。</p>
<p>在本論裏，是依照民法的標題，分成五章，分别把各種婚俗的習慣，參照着民法裏的條文，加以解釋和分析，這對於一般没有法律知識的讀者，是很方便的，不單如此，作者更把司法行政部民商事習慣調查錄的條文，把他作了叙述婚俗的主要淵源，依其性質事由，分别在各段裏引用出來，這樣，一般讀者，就可以和法律上所頒定的條例，有所參照，不用説對於讀者是非常有益處的。</p>
<p>一般的説來，這本「中國婚姻法綜論」一書，是站在法律學的立塲上，來闡述婚姻的制度的社會現象，使讀者對於婚姻的本質和史的發展有一個鮮明的輪廓，無疑的，這不但對於婚姻法的研究者，就是對於人類史的研究的讀者，也是相當的有一個帮助的。</p>
<h3>「新書批判與介紹」</h3>
<p>— 戴英夫</p>
<p>—文化建設一月號—</p>
<p>文化建設月刋一月號是一個特輯，呌做：「新書批判與介紹」。這一期的內容除一半仍照普通的編製外，另一半却完全是新書批　與介紹一類的文字。這一欄所收的文字計有二十篇之多，在量上可説適合於特輯的編法。現在，我們所要做的，是把這一類的批判與介紹的文字，作一番概要的考察。不過，在這短短的篇幅裏，要把這二十篇文字一一加以論述，是不可能的；所以只好在牠們中間提出幾篇來談談</p>
<p>第一，便是陳石孚所寫的十字路口之中國。這書是英文本，著者的張彭養；是專爲歐美的讀者而寫作的。陳石孚對於這本書的介紹文字，可説是簡潔而有力的。他在篇首解釋了這本書的重要性；接着便從事於分章的介紹。最後，把著作者的結論，牽引了出來，當做他自己的結論。那結論是這樣的：</p>
<p>羅氏説：</p>
<p>「我認爲西方文化的特長，是科學方法，中國文化的特長，是一種合理的人生觀。我們希望西方的科學方法與中國的合理的人生觀，漸漸結合起來。」</p>
<p>像陳氏參引著作者結論以作介紹文字的方法，是最有力的，能給讀者對於原書的，一種正確的認識和理解。</p>
<p>第二，便是樊仲雲所作的强大的美國。這也是英文本，爲美國人Engene　J.Young所著。樊氏對於這一本所寫的文字，是介紹和批評兼施的。他在篇首説明了這一本的特點，即是含有許多未知的故事。接着，把全書中最重要的三章加以介紹。那三章就是：「强而弱的日本」，「中國大陸將任人分割乎？」，「美國掌握了勢力的均衡」。樊氏對於那有關中國的一章，這樣介紹：</p>
<p>「……但是以日本的壓廹而促進中國的統一，建立軍備，以驅逐日本，那末危險怕要比日本更甚。故由著者之意，最好華北能够獨立，自成一國，日本不得加以干涉。英美日三國從此得到妥恊。同時，他更主張華南與華中分離，亦自成一國家」</p>
<p>固然，樊氏對原著者的主張已經忠實的介紹過了，但是，却不曾盡過嚴厲的批評之責。像這種以美國人立塲的錯誤論調，是應該施以糾正的。不錯，樊氏在結論上已表示了抗議的意思；但是，這抗議畢竟太軟弱了，反不及介紹文字的力量。</p>
<p>第三，我們來談談滌塵所作的國際公法論上册吧。這本書是中文本，爲李聖五所作。滌塵氏對於這本書的文字，是純介紹。其介紹方法很爲高妙。他首先説明了列强蔑視國際公法的事實，和其需要。其次，便從事於分章的介紹。在結論上，他説：這一本國際公法論是很好的，爲中國民衆所必需讀的書籍；因爲中國大受國際公法被列强蔑視的痛苦的緣故</p>
<p>第四，便是孫福熙所寫的文藝心理學。孫氏因爲自己是個藝術家，所以，拿藝術家的眼光來闡明這一本書的重要性。這也是一篇純介紹文字。首先，他很别緻的把原著者朱光潛的自白舉了出來。其次，説明中國的藝術向來不依據理論的弊病，因是而談到文藝理論的需要。末了，他用「文藝心理學是研究文藝的創作家與批評家的食譜。至其內容，待大家閲讀原書以後再覓機會介紹。」這兩句話，作爲結論；所以，這可説是很忠實而有力的介紹文字。</p>
<p>本來，還有兩篇，如：馮三秋的中國鄉村建設批判，汪馥泉的日人研究中國學術之一斑，也有提出談論之必要的，但是爲了篇幅所限，只好放棄了。總之，文化建設月刋這一期的「新書批評與介紹」特輯。所收的文字，都是極其鄭重的，忠實可靠的，决非書局廣告式的文字可比；其有利於讀書界，當然是不可忽視的。</p>
<h3>「法布爾傳」</h3>
<p>— 鶻雄</p>
<p>G.　V.　Legros著林奄方譯　商務版</p>
<p>昆虫世界，是一個廣大的園地，頗可供我們研究；狀而普通人士見到這現象，嘆口氣，稱述自然是如何偉大，立即摇摇頭走了，絶不去探索其究竟，而所得，也僅是可以嘆口氣的知識而已。抱着這種態度去應世，是因循，虚妄；去治學問，則大概不念有什麽了不起的成就的。當我們看到法布爾的精神，真將感覺到異常的慚愧。法布爾的性情，是「凡事都要澈底的，如果研究花崗石，那中途所有的新發生的疑問，都需一一弄個明白，非到最後的花崗石問題水落石出，總不罷休」，你看這熱忱的科學家，是如何的在困難的環境裏孳孳不倦的思索着昆虫們每一個小動作</p>
<p>柏格森説：「非直觀不能窮生命的本源」。法布爾的一生就永遠在「直觀窮生命的本源」上努力。他認爲各種昆虫的舉動没有一樣無意思的。令常人發噱的事，往往可以引起賢哲的深省。我們在日常行走的小道上偶然看見很普通的事，若澈底研究起來，也就有如日月星辰，大千世界，會發生無量數的問題。説起來森羅萬象，一個個都是一種號碼，這個號碼裏頭，又還隱着無限的意義，我們如善解這些活動號碼，把其所隱約的意思整理或探發出來，那麽雖是蕞爾一塊無用之地，對於孤獨的研究家，就也不當是一個意外好的美術展覽塲，法布爾就是領導我們到這個精美駭人的美術館裏去的。</p>
<p>達爾文在生物學説上是法布爾的敵人，一個主張進化論，一個主張本能説，可是達爾文給他的信説，「通歐洲，想也再没有人像我這麽讚歎閣下的研究啊。這很可見得這位科學家的被人推崇了。由於自然就是詩這句至言，所以他亦被人稱爲詩人。真的，讀他的大著昆虫記，好比國返到詩的故鄉傷春的杜鵑，草上的蛺蝶，夏夜河畔的螢，永遠含着淚的絡緯娘，這些都是詩人的對象，也正是法布爾的對象。甚被人推荐爲諾貝爾文學奬金的候選人良非偶然也。</p>
<p>關於這位法國的大科學家的一生行述，都有記載在這本書裏，著者李格羅斯，是法氏的畏友，亦是一位熱心科學的學者。這本書的草稿略歷，曾在法氏未死之前公布，且有法氏的序文，很加讚許。他説：「作傳的工夫是要把那個人的一生，叙得有趣纔好，而我這位朋友，卻十分體會這種宗旨，能把我歷年對於環境所觀察的情形重現於紙上，又能把我所遵循的方法，和我的思想以及我所有的研究，所有的發明，提綱挈領，分明地加以解釋。這種工作的確有許多困難，然而他竟成就了這部傑作。序述井井有條，就是我自己也只好歎爲觀止。」從這本書內，我們約略能看到這位永年戴着闊邊的凉帽的怪人在烈日下跋山涉水看蜜蜂兒談情説愛，又在深夜提着燈照廵行蟋蟀的工作。那麽不畏寒暑的倔强的近代的「無師自通」的科學家，（他很蔑視書本上的知識，必定要經自己精密的觀察，認爲正確纔肯相信。）</p>
<p>因爲他用着通俗的筆編了全是實騐動物心理學的教科書，在法國教育上掀起了新的潮流，是以亦被認爲大教育家。他的大半生爲了麵包問題，是供獻於教育上的</p>
<p>在這小册子裏，著者説極力請主人翁自己出來想話，法布爾的昆虫記裏面，往往流露出這位孤單格物家的自叙傳，這傳記也不過採擇這些根本意思，把他先後貫通下去吧了。</p>
<p>看看這樣一個大科學家，詩人，教育家的傳記，無論在學問上或是修養良，將都是良好的帮助。</p>
<p>法布爾的名著昆虫記久已爲世界所稱頌，各國皆有譯本，中國却没有，以前魯迅先生曾想將牠繙譯過來，但不幸而逝世了，我很希望有人能肩起這介紹的任務。賜給我們的一定不會少。</p>

<h3>總結帳情形轉好</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>年關是難過的，工商各業，一逢這關頭，大有艱於應付之概。尤其近年來，因市面冷落，致一般經營者，更覺䀞苦連天。過去三四年中，本市各業，在總結帳期間，無法維持，而宣告倒閉的，為數實屬不少。這顧然是世界縱濟恐慌的影響。</p>
<p>但去年的情形，却有些不同。據十四日報載，本市各業，均能安然渡過難關。特別是金融業，頓呈好况，開五年來未有的局面。金融恐慌，以二三年前為甚。二十三年的總結帳期，已有若干行莊，被迫停業。至二十四年，形勢更見緊張，停業的銀行，凡十四家，匯劃莊有九家倒閉。上年則拆息鬆弛，外匯平穩，票據流通量增加，公債證券價格趨漲，可謂金融安定的時期。</p>
<p>不但上海一埠如此，在同日的新聞，載有各地通信，如福州，嘉定，常熟，江陰，常州，以及南通等處，皆有好消息報告，謂去年工商各業，情况頗有起色。年關總結帳，收帳成績既佳，獲利者，亦大有其人。這現象是可喜的。</p>
<p>上年總結帳，情形轉好的原因，大約有二。一因各地農產豐收，故工商各業，均受其賜，頓告昭蘇。二因政府實施新貨幣政策，使金融業，得以安定。</p>
<p>然而這種好况，恐是一時的，且亦未能普通。例如粵省一地，在同日報載通信，去年一年中，經濟情形，極為惡劣，各業大有今昔之感。這是個證明。其他各處，工商各業，想還有疲困若往年的。</p>
<p>至從一般人民的生活方面看，則情形不但未見好轉，甚且更覺困苦難堪。因去年市面百物騰貴，消費程度增高。而胼手胝足的農工，及依靠薪水為活的中小店員，所得報酬，仍然如故。這便不能不受其影響。單以日常生活必需品來説，去年上海柴米昂貴，魚肉蔬菜，一齊漲價。結果居民的生活，雖極變儉約，亦有不勝負擔之苦。</p>
<p>拿以上所述的情形，來作一對照，可見去年工商各業的好轉，不過是畸形的現象而已。因各業的昭蘇，必待人民生活安定之後。故今後要望市面能日趨繁榮，設法增進人民的生活程度，是必要的。否則所調好轉，恐就難以持久。</p>
<h3>初春夜記</h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>春天一來，好像什麽都變了。</p>
<p>夜晚，一個人孤獨地穿過寂寞的街，春風溫暖地拂過我底臉，那感覺，同往常一樣：春天開始了。抬起頭來，天空底顏色跟塗過一層濃密的青色的油彩一樣，那麼滋潤，那麼美。月亮還只是一個小芽兒，貼在上面，就像海洋里飄着的白帆，北斗星明亮地照耀着，他有剪刀似的尾巴，和兩隻尖尖的翅膀，活像一隻燕子，疾速地飛行着。空氣清新而美麗，沒有一點微塵挾雜在里面，從街這一頭，可以毫無阻碍地望到那一頭。路燈平靜地放着光，好像睜着一隻巨眼，在看萬物底生長，圍繞着他的虹樣的光圈微笑着。</p>
<p>每天晚上，我望着春天該來了，記着孩子時候躺在母觀底懷里，她指給我看的那些星斗的名字，現在，他眞的來了，坐在床上，聽着近處耶穌教堂底飄盪的鐘聲，春天底脚步慢慢地移近我底窗前，他用風底手指輕輕地伸進手來，向我握手説：</p>
<p>“春天來了”！</p>
<p>我底心像躺在母親懷里那麼快樂。</p>
<p>我喜歡春天，喜歡春天的月光，和那顆北斗星。因為我是春天的孩子，生下來的時候，正是明媚的春天。然而，我一直没有和春天接近過，我在痛苦的生活里生長起來。不過，我却望着春天底到來，正像普式庚底詩句里説的話：</p>
<p>“不幸”底忠實姊妹，</p>
<p>是那黑暗地底“希望”</p>
<p>他鼓勵着勇氣和歡樂，</p>
<p>要來的是良辰一旦。</p>
<p>每當春天來了，我總記起孩子時候讀的愛羅先珂底散文“春天及其力量”，</p>
<h3>“老上海”</h3>
<p>— 春申</p>
<p>單是久住在上海的人，還不能算是“老上海”，必須對於上海的一切情形很熟悉，那才能算是老上海。</p>
<p>老上海是不貪便宜的，因為“便宜”決非好貨，譬如魚肝油一物，是現在應時的禮品，但是廉價的雜牌魚肝油，製煉不精，調服毫焦效驗，老上海决不肯上當。</p>
<p>所以老上海買起魚肝油來，總是到五洲大藥房去買，因為五洲本牌的乳白魚肝油，是用藍色反應法精密檢定，維他命含量豐富。五洲的地球牌麥精魚肝油，是用純凈的鱉鱼肝油，和上等的麦精等合炼，味道很甜，最是可靠。</p>
<h3>我的安眠法</h3>
<p>— 碧湖</p>
<p>在冷天的時候，因爲四肢僵直，我常常患失眠的毛病，很是苦惱！後來有個朋友告訴我，他教我臨睡以前，用熱水洗脚，水中加放「亞林沙面」少許，這樣一則能使血液下注，安腦催眠？二則可以止癢祛濕，免除脚癬；依法實行以後，果然每夜都得到安睡。並且我妻每晚洗滌，水中也放「亞林沙而」，至今體態很健！我想這就是消毒的功效。所以寫出來供大家施用。</p>
<p>「亞林沙而」計裝—四兩瓶，八兩瓶，一磅瓶，二磅瓶四種，二磅瓶比較最爲合算，各處五洲藥房和大藥房都有出售。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>他那熱情的話語一直激勸着我底心，我總把它找出來，靜心地讀一遍，今年却找不到了，也許丟在故鄉，也許被擠在角落里，可是，我不能忘記愛羅先珂，那位可親可敬的盲詩人底話，那些把我一年年鼓勵起來的話……</p>
<p>他説，春天是偉大的，有着不可比擬的力量，他説：“朋友，春天和我們同居了。他主宰我們底田野和我們底園，他統治各處地方。他要穿過人們底冷的心里了，還要去敲黑暗與冷淡里假寐着的靈魂底門。他用了一片綠的天鵝絨的毯蓋住我們底田野；他用了美而且香的花裝飾我們底園；他使鳥唱戀愛的歌，他使江河低語希望的話，他使柔和的晚風給失望的心帶回他秘密的親愛的夢。他使我們忘卻了長的冷的冬夜的一切孤寂，冷而暗的冬天的心的背叛；到田野山林里去的每回的散步，對我們表示一個美之新的世界；每個夜間，在那時，新月對了疲倦的大地送下他底溫𣏗的銀色的接吻，都是一個新的啟示”！</p>
<p>這些話，我都體騐過。時問快得很，經過幾個春天，我已到這成年了。我溫習了他説的那些話以後，就把他底一句問話拿來問自己。他説：在這種種啟示底下，在你底心的花園里，“朋友，在春天里你將播下什麼樣的種子呢”？</p>
<p>過去，我種了些什麼種子呢？只是一種：讓春天永在我底冰冷的心里。但是，永遠沒有得到果賓。只是一年的的一個秋天，一位朋友，他在我心里播下一粒眞理的種子，在我和朋友底培植里成長起來了，因為這種子底成長，今年，我才明白，春天可以永遠住在我們心里的，同時，我心里還可以種下別的種子，那麼，我種什麼呢？只有一種，是我喜歡的，就是無花果。</p>
<p>我把這種子播下了。</p>
<p>我要默不作聲地工作，用我所用的力，使種子生出芽，成長起來，而且開出花，不過，那花別人是看不見的，我不需要他們看見，讓他偸偸地開，偸偸地謝了，當人們沒有注意到的時候，我用春天的快樂的心，去收穫，收穫得豐滿的紫色的發着光辉的结實,……那果實是衆多的,豐滿的,……</p>
<p>夜深了，天空底顏色更加可愛，都市底霓虹燈底紅綠的光，在天際寂寞地溶解進天藍里，變成微紫，就像成熟的無花果底顏色，就像打綠色的葉子里霹出面孔來的無花果底顏色……</p>
<p>我合上書本，透過玻璃窗，望着這颜色，心里有着説不出的春天的快樂，夜風溫暖地吹進來，穿進我底心窩，溫暖的春天在心里住下了，讓我默默地工作，默默地收穫自己底果實吧！</p>
<h3>三秃子</h3>
<p>— 馬蜂</p>
<p>半個月沒有看到三禿子挑着糖攤上街，今天早上可看到他了。人不像從前那般了，一點精神也沒有，笑容看不見，肌黃面瘦，就像從墳里鑽出来的人一樣。</p>
<p>張大嫂碰到他的時候，驚異地開了口。</p>
<p>“老三，你怎末的還沒好就上起街來了？你看，你臉上的氣色——一點兒也沒復原呢！”</p>
<p>三禿子擔着挑子停了停，看着张大嫂，冷笑——不，應酬地笑了一下，搖擺搖擺頭，説：</p>
<p>“有什麼法子想呢？病了快二十天了！幾個錢都花光了，不上街怎末辦呢，挑着糖攤上城里轉轉也散散心，省得悶在家里沒事幹，光犯愁！……”</p>
<p>張大嫂話也説不上來了，很以為然地點了點頭。三禿子轉過頭去要走，張大嫂卻把他截住了。</p>
<p>“我想起一樁事來了，老三，請你費心替我們打聽打聽米的價錢，我當家的明天要到城里去……”</p>
<p>三禿子沒等她説完就應下了！——他知道張大嫂要他作的是什麼事：打聽打聽行情，要到城里去買。</p>
<p>三禿子在到城里去的大道上走起來了。</p>
<p>天氣怪暖和，三禿子病還沒有完全好——身子虛弱，走起來出了一身汗。進城門的時候，看到警察們像有事般地檢查來來去去的人，他驚慌了：不安靜地望着。</p>
<p>“喲，喲！這又不知是出了什麽事！”</p>
<p>三禿子暗自説了。他走着，盡力地鎮靜了一下：——不管他是什麼事，反正與我沒有什麼關係！可是他的擔子走了沒幾步，就給四個警察圍上了。三禿子驚慌了。在一個警察走上來想捉住他底胳膊的當兒，他更怕起來：——</p>
<p>“什麼事呵？哎喲，逮亂黨……逮了去……”</p>
<p>三禿子底臉色都嚇得變白了。一種意識鑽進他底腦袋里，從警察的手里閃躲開，丟下擔子，併命地往城外跑去。時刻地回轉頭去望：他們要攆來了沒有？回頭望，回頭望——他更得加勁地跑了：紅星，綠星在他眼前旋轉着；两條腿很吃力地起落着，像不自立似地，像踏在棉花包上似地。汗，不住氣地淌，那一寸多長的顯髮，都在豎立起來！——帽子在跑出城門來的時候，給警察一把抓掉了。</p>
<p>五六個警察死命地在三禿子後面攆，又大聲地喊呌——讓前邊的岗警截住他！警笛響起來了。</p>
<p>三禿子走頭沒路了：前邊有人截着：楼邊有人撵着！慌張的摸不着手脚，横在眼里的是條護城河，他望了望對面岸上，——一跳，落在護城河里了。河水是在不停息地流着。他竭力地游泳着。睁開眼望：四下里黑壓壓地，全是人。在三禿子給河水打沒下去，死命地想掙扎上來的當兒，河里落上一塊一塊的泥土澎澎澎…河水跳躍起來……。他是精疲力竭了，他沒有打勝河水——沉落下去了。</p>
<p>三禿子底屍體在城門旁邊的地方停放着，等醫官的檢查。人堆擠成一個蛋看！看！這個大烟鬼。人們閒談着。</p>
<p>屍體驗過了：臉帶烟色，……自行投河身死。</p>
<p>三禿子也沒有家屬，屍體就埋在義地里了。</p>
<p>街上再也看不到三禿子的糖挑了，镇上的人，都以為他是病死的。</p>
<h3>廢歷新年的弄堂生活者</h3>
<p>— 陳浩雄作</p>
<h3>官樣文章</h3>
<p>— 葉</p>
<p>官場的公文往還，大概也像打官司一樣，似乎非這樣就足以顧出做官的威嚴，所以久而久之，成了一定的格套，上行文必須用“等因奉此，”若用了“等情據此”那就不單是笑話了。而且對於文字中所表示的意思，據説越是含糊却越能表現出是一個寫公文的老手。</p>
<p>小百姓打官司，除了“傳進去審一通，事前還須呈狀紙現在是有了“大律師”了，在前清沒有，不過却有類似的“訟師，”狀子也稱為“禀單”，我們如今還能在坊間買得到的，“近代四大惡訟，翻閱翻閱，眞覺得“一椿大事，”一經他們之手，即刻化為無事，或則無中生有，終使對方家破人亡，實則細察他的功能，只有一二個字，這一二個字是含糊爾可的。</p>
<p>這種官場所用的文章，一到小市民階層，牠的意義也越加廣泛了。小百姓就替牠另外起了個名稱，呌做“官樣文章”意義也廣泛到“只重形式，不重實際”的都是。</p>
<p>“官樣文章”既然是虚偽的裝飾，是出賣人肉馒頭的黑店，是掛羊頭賣狗肉，所以火車到了時刻儘管可以脫班數十分鐘之久，公務員在辦公時間儘管不在辦公室辦公，而長途汽車的車廂裏雖然高掛着此車祇限载“三十三人”的牌子，却儘管可以超過至四十三人，甚之超过四十三人。</p>
<p>打官話是這樣多，“官樣文章”是這樣夥，中國一日不去“官樣文章，”則一日高掛着空牌。</p>
<p>——如何才能去掉這塊牌子呢？</p>
<h3>神蹟</h3>
<p>— 珞珈</p>
<p>在本報上讀得一則電訊，日子已經記不起來了。那電訊的內容，是：世界公教大會今日舉行兒童節，有菲列濱小學生名范加拉者匐行四百碼至大會神壇，俯身禱告。據向公衆宣稱，彼在六歲時，因病失音，未能言語，諸醫束手。去年彼默向上帝祈禱，求助並願終身為上帝虔誠信徒；至年底竟徐徐能言，該童至此乃堅其聲調稱：“我信此必上帝之功，上帝進我先命，恢復我聲音，我將誠心誠意貢獻于上帝。”衆奇之，認為神蹟。</p>
<p>這自然是“神蹟”當我讀至“堅其聲調”的時候，彷佛那啞吧菲列濱小學生眞在我的耳邊高聲朗誦“馬太福音”似的。但是我手頭適巧有一册醫藥雜誌，最後附錄着名醫的臨床經驗，裏面也有一則類似的“神蹟”，可是帮助那个不幸的“因疾失音”的啞吧“徐徐能言”的䔔不是“上帝”，而是一個日本著名的醫生。據載是聲帶發生拘擊狀態，因而“失音”云。現在那個菲列濱小學生倒底“失音”到若何程度是不得而知；但既稱因疾失音，未能言語，“尚沒有變成十足啞吧是可以確信的。在中學裹讀起碼生理學的時候，我們也已經知道發音就靠着聲带的震動，如有聲電影的有聲帶片然：如果聲帶一出毛病，自然“未能言語”了。不過聲帶的拘擊狀態和眞正啞吧的區別，愧非名醫，又非上帝，未便妄加斷論了。那菲列濱小學生的得以“恢復我聲音”大概也屬於前者病狀的，所謂“諸醫束手”，不過是被那些“慷慨”的庸醫把功勞記在上帝賬上。</p>
<p>不過話要説回來，我在這裏並不反對信教自由，中國人的信奉菩薩，和那菲列濱小學生的願誠心誠意貢獻於上帝，都是有各人的自由的，可是在二十世紀的科學昌明時代，醫學上已經發明了可以用x光來照徹各種病症的時候，向菩薩求仙方，或默向上帝祈禱，是太以生命為兒戲了。</p>
<p>“有求必應”與“神蹟”都是宣傳品，而一切宗教的宣傳品更是“神蹟”中的“神蹟”。</p>

<p>中西（一○四○）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「春閨怨詞片」</p>
<p>曲曲欄杆曲曲牆。灣灣曲曲繞廻廊。行行去去穿芳徑。一陣陣風來一陣香。蝶翩翩。雙燕燕。枝枝葉葉影垂楊。但見那桃花灼灼明如錦。柳絮飄飄欲舞狂。又聽那，鐵馬鏘鏘風動響。鶯啼嚦嚦鼓笙簧。簾鈞未見重重捲。裊裊爐薰韓壽香。想奴奴，鎭口昏昏縈舊恨。倦迷迷懶去繡鴛鴦。玉梳不理絲絲髮。寶鏡慷施淡淡妝。終日裏，獨坐蘭房聲寂寂。惹起了，懨懨臥病在牙牀。便喚那，爐中添撥熊熊火。侍婢忙忙煎藥湯。但聽得，風雨凄凄窗外打。狐燈黯黯夜愁長。不由他，心中是是非非想。私語喃喃暗自量。曾記得，我我卿卿前有約。只望那朝朝暮暮伴蕭郎。竟不料，茫茫情海風波起。害得奴，孤影單單空守房。我是寸寸廻腸寸寸斷。想思不見淚洋洋。從今後，路迢迢盼不到音信寄。血淚斑斑哭斷腸。正覺得，苦雨濛濛悲寂寞。愁風瑟瑟成凄凉。只剩那，燈殘點點抛紅豆。悄悄羅幃淡無光。可憐我，自恨悠悠傷命薄。淚汪汪濕透綺羅裳。試看那，庭前青草年年綠。只恨得，縷縷情絲繫不長。夢魂渺渺熟黄粱。</p>
<p>侯九霞「雙珠鳳」</p>
<p>李樹德（九四○）下午三時半至四時一刻</p>

<p>瀟湘妃子美無雙。聽得。鸚鵡吟詩欲斷腸。金風吹落秋桐葉。瘦怯姣軀覺晚凉。停綉綫。掩紗窗。蘭房沐罷理殘妝。淡施螺黛春山綠。薄染胭脂蘭麝香。縷玉斜梳雲鬢膩。褪紅衫霞肌芳。瑶堦小立渾無語。團扇輕摇對夕陽。金烏漸漸西山没。月上花梢映銀牆。轉側自憐嬌影好。低呼雪雁點銀缸。紫鵑婢。問姑娘。因何常嘆淚雙行。心事滿懷人不曉。爲誰消瘦减容光。無可奈何更漏永。羅衣寛缷上牙床。聽得。雨打芭蕉濕海棠。</p>

<h3>「彈性女兒」碎錦</h3>
<p>「彈性女兒」中，有着三個不同性格的舞女，一個是方麗珠，她是飽經世故，曾數度失戀的少女，她認爲戀愛是可怕的，她是一個儘情享樂主義者。</p>
<p>一個是胡雪華，她的性情怪僻，她不很明瞭戀愛的真義，祗希望自己能够得到一個安逸的歸宿。這兩個角色，由嚴月閒，朱秋痕客串演出，有優越的成績。</p>
<p>另一個是莫美蓬，她是被生活重擔所壓廹，而不得不去幹那舞女生涯，她始終想脱離這惡環境，可是到底没有償她的夙願，這一個角色，是由路明任飾。</p>
<h3>「王先生生財有道」雜綴</h3>
<p>矮而胖得要命的王師母桑淑貞，和瘦而長得要命的小陳太太翟綺綺，同着年紀青而漂亮的小阿媛李琳，在「王先生生財有道」裏，有民間歌舞「打蓮相的演出」。</p>
<p>秦始皇求不死之藥，没有成功，但現代科學發明，在「王先生生財有道」裏，居然有「返老還童」的事，明明是鷄皮鶴髮的老太婆，居然會變成年輕貌美的小姑娘，大狗也居然會變成小狗，煞是有趣。</p>
<h3>「流線戀愛」一幕</h3>
<h3>「十字街頭」動静錄</h3>
<p>「十字街頭」是以六個知識青年爲縱，描寫失業苦悶爲緯的作品，題材是非常現實而生動的。</p>
<p>這裏刻劃出六個不同的個性，和不同的發展，鑄成了一個在目前這個社會中，所常能發見的青年們的故事。</p>
<p>這六個不同的人物，是由趙丹，英茵以及新人白楊，吕班，沙蒙，伊明來分任，在人物的選擇上，沈西苓在事前也曾費過一番心思的。</p>
<p>「十字街頭」雖是一個悲劇，但全戲完全是以喜劇的手法來處理的，十分輕鬆明快，頗能迎合一般觀衆之口味。</p>
<p>吳茵和尤光照，兩個大胖子在這裏演一對貧苦失業夫婦，老尤唱京戲，喝黄酒，演出頗有噱頭。</p>

The original order stated, "Zhang Xueliang is hereby granted restoration of rights." This order. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 17th)</p>

The National Government meeting on the 13th received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, but it was not discussed and was handed over to the President of the Judicial Yuan for review.

<h3>US Senate Judiciary Committee Passes Judicial Reform Plan</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt Achieves First-Stage Victory</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt's plan to reform the judiciary so that the Supreme Court can no longer obstruct his New Deal legislation has achieved the first stage of victory with the passage of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee of the Senner Bill. The Senner Bill, proposed by Senator Senner of Texas, argues that Supreme Court justices should be able to retire at full pay when they reach the age of seventy. This bill is widely regarded as the first step in President Roosevelt's plan to take effect. It was passed by the House of Representatives on the tenth of this month by a vote of 315 to 75. Now that it has been endorsed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, it is expected to pass in the Senate next week. (Sixteenth Reuters Telegram from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt's judicial reform plan faced a sudden opposition today. Progressive Republican Senator Borah also claimed that he does not support the Supreme Court justice retirement bill that has already been passed in the House. The president's plan originally hoped to avoid serious controversy in the Senate, but Borah's action has shattered that hope. (Sixteenth National Telegram)</p>
<h3>US President Suggests Four Measures to Stabilize Farmers' Lives</h3>
<p>Submits Message to Congress</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt recently sent a message to Congress urging it to swiftly pass legislation to stabilize the lives of farmers across the country. The content includes four suggestions to Congress: ⑴ The government should provide long-term loans to tenant farmers who have the potential to become landowners, and provide technical guidance on cultivation methods. ⑵ Small loans should be provided to small landowners to pay off debts without having to sell their land. ⑶ Barren land should no longer be cultivated, and farmers there should be found fertile land elsewhere to earn a living and reap abundant harvests. ⑷ State and federal authorities should work together to improve the current system of sharecropping (i.e., the system where landowners and tenants share the harvest). The President had previously appointed a special committee to study agricultural issues. The committee's research report has been completed and was also sent to Congress by the President along with the above message for reference. (Sixteenth Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>On Unification</h3>
<p>— Beginning</p>
<p>As long as you are Chinese, you sincerely pray for the unification of our country. The reason is too obvious and too simple, even young children can understand it. Especially recently, as the Shanghai All Circles United National Salvation Alliance Declaration said, "The national crisis is deepening, and the crisis is imminent. There is no way to save the country without completing true unification." In short, the necessity of unification is as clear as the sun in the sky, and there is no need for us to elaborate. What we want to mention here are a few points related to unification.</p>
<p>For more than twenty years, advocating for the meaning of unification has not started today. In the recent past, some people advocated for unification by force, and this advocacy has even been partially and temporarily put into practice. What was the result? The so-called unified situation was only a flash in the pan, and good times did not last long. The reason is easy to understand. It is that such unification was not built on a truly solid foundation. We must understand that the connection between people is based on common life goals and common demands as its pivot. The power of teaching and rewarding is very small here. If they get their common life goals and needs, even hundreds of millions of people cannot be dispersed. If they lose their common life goals and needs, even two or three people are difficult to unite. The true foundation of unified unity is here. In the past, because there was a facade of unification but no foundation of unification, such a unified situation was like flowers on a stone. Although it was obtained, it was lost. The lessons of the predecessors are a mirror for future generations. Based on the lessons of past facts, we must not only strengthen the unified situation, but also strengthen the foundation of unification. This is the first point.</p>
<p>When we talk about unification now, we must not narrow our horizons and ignore the main goal that must be achieved in our unification movement. On the map of our country, up to now, large areas of territory are no longer under the unified sovereign jurisdiction of our country. For example, the pseudo-autonomous organization in eastern Hebei and the puppet Manchukuo are. As long as these anti-unification abnormal states are not eliminated for a day, we can be considered as not achieving the goal of true unification for a day. Moreover, looking deeper, if this step cannot be achieved, even a unification movement within a smaller scope may be difficult to achieve. Our territory is whole, and our sovereignty is whole. When one part is damaged, it will naturally affect the whole. Therefore, what we seek is a broad unification movement, not a unification movement within a smaller scope. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Today, all Chinese people should accept a supreme principle of saving the country, that is, the interests of the nation outweigh all other interests. Because if the nation perishes and the country perishes, all interests are out of the question. Since all Chinese people are fighting together under the premise of prioritizing national interests, everyone must be mutually tolerant, mutually forgiving, abandon unnecessary disputes, and eliminate the prejudices of fighting each other. Each individual must have such an attitude, and true unification will be realized. Under common life goals and needs, everyone will certainly unite and unite, but in this process, we must also work hard, work hard to overcome our own habits and attitudes that may give a bad impression of unification. We must eliminate prejudice, be completely impartial, and treat others with sincerity. Everyone must sincerely join hands. This is an important condition for creating true unification. This is the third point.</p>
<p>We extremely support the unification movement. The above are just small supplementary opinions.</p>
<h3>Veteran of Japanese Parliament, Ozaki Yukio, Displayed Eloquence</h3>
<p>Criticizes Government for Lack of Sincerity Towards China, Greatly Puzzled by Treaty with Germany, Crisis of Military Interference in Politics Lurks</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Ozaki Yukio, a member of the House of Representatives who has been continuously elected since the establishment of the parliamentary system in Japan, maintained silence for a long time. At 5:10 PM today, he participated in the question-and-answer session in the plenary session of the House of Representatives, questioning the government's beliefs regarding the essence and operation of constitutional politics, and also elaborating his own beliefs. The atmosphere in the venue was somewhat tense for a while. Ozaki's eloquence is as follows:</p>
<p>⑴ The increasing national defense expenditure and the excessive burden on the people are said to be unavoidable. Please explain the basis for this.</p>
<p>⑵ The reason for its inevitability comes from within or from outside.</p>
<p>⑶ If this inevitable situation comes from outside, is it from land or sea? Please explain.</p>
<p>⑷ Whether it comes from land or sea, if it is considered necessary to defend against it, then Japan alone is not convenient to undertake it. Please explain this matter.</p>
<p>⑸ Since it is called national defense, there should be a hypothetical opponent. Does it have the same or more strength than the opponent?</p>
<p>⑹ I believe that the sense of security of national defense is different from strengthening armaments. What is the government's view?</p>
<p>⑺ What is the result of the Japan-Germany agreement? If the purpose is to defend against communism, then what is the effectiveness of defending against communism? The Japan-Germany agreement is beneficial to Germany, and Japan cannot consider it beneficial. In which direction does Japan want to develop its diplomatic policy? What diplomatic policy does it adhere to?</p>
<p>As for relations with the Soviet Union, if it is said that it is not only fearing the spread of communism but also wanting to conclude a non-aggression treaty, if the treaty is concluded and they break it, is it not possible to take decisive measures at that time?</p>
<p>And the most important issue of China, and what China is prepared for, is that it does not know what Japanese diplomacy is for, so it should express a clear and concrete policy. If it treats China in this way, China will also open its mind. As for Manchuria, it was obtained by Japan betting the national fortune on the two major wars, the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, so even if China says it wants to recover lost territory, there is no need to argue with it. But problems other than the Manchuria problem should not be impossible to coordinate. If Sino-Japanese friendship can truly be implemented, it is not just lip service but sincerity, China will also be happy to shake hands with us.</p>
<p>And the so-called "extraordinary period" is now popular. What does it mean? I really don't understand. Europe is truly facing a crisis, but where is the real crisis in the East? It is impossible to consider. After the Manchurian Incident, the League of Nations loudly called for economic sanctions against Japan, but what can those fifty countries do to Japan? Their own countries are in crisis and are unable to take care of themselves, let alone deal with us. The so-called watching the fire from the other side of the river, and today's fire is still on the other side of the Indian Ocean, so there is no need to expand armaments externally. As for the internal situation, the internal affairs of the Japanese Empire have indeed encountered their crisis. Prime Minister Hayashi and others can certainly break the crisis of internal affairs, and there seem to be not a few great people in the military, not only ministers, but even we who guide public opinion. After sixty years of political life, I have not yet known of such a great person who can guide an era alone. I have never heard of it. If those who guide politics with great enthusiasm, then they should take off their military uniforms and come forward. We will certainly listen to their guidance with a clean body. If they allow their mouths to interfere in politics with the power of a group or with the background of force, then such a good opportunity to do whatever they want without any scruples is rare in the world.</p>
<p>The old general Ozaki's speech lasted for one hour and forty minutes. He stepped down amidst applause. After Prime Minister Hayashi made a simple reply, Minister of the Army Matsuyama replied:</p>
<p>I am deeply frightened by the February 26 Incident. We are now moving towards purifying the army. The reason and motivation for this matter, to put it bluntly, is that young officers disobeyed the imperial order and made a rash decision. In other words, it is the corruption and degradation of the political situation. I will never consider their actions to be right. The motivation for their actions should be regarded as a lesson from others. It is quite significant. The meeting adjourned at 7:07 PM. (Seventeenth Allied News Telegram)</p>
<h3>Yesterday Afternoon's Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] At the House of Representatives' general meeting on the 17th, due to the rumor that Yukio Ozaki would run, there was not enough space to stand in the visitor's gallery, and the members were also extremely nervous. The meeting started at 1:15 PM and immediately began questioning the state ministers. Kozō Matsumura of the Seiyūkai took the podium.</p>
<p>Industrial Control Issues</p>
<p>He stated that general industries should always be based on private management as a principle, and state socialism, such as nationalizing industries, is absolutely unacceptable. The previous cabinet's electricity management plan should be withdrawn. What is the Lin cabinet's spirit of industrial guidance? Japan's overall policy also originates from acquiring raw materials and resources and establishing industrial self-sufficiency. Is there any preparation to participate in the World Economic Conference on the redistribution of world assets? There is still no industrial control mechanism to integrate Japan and Manchukuo. Does the government intend to establish an Imperial Economic Conference? The exchange control law of former Finance Minister Mayang has caused suspicion abroad and shaken the domestic economy. Does Finance Minister Yūki intend to revoke the law on July 31st, when it expires? What is the government's view on future prices? Finance Minister Yūki replied: ① To establish economic control between Japan and Manchukuo, the Japan-Manchukuo Economic Committee is planned to be utilized. ① The reason for reducing national fuel policy expenses is to re-examine the Imperial Fuel Company proposal. ① The trade administration organization reform plan is planned to be submitted to this session of the Diet and is currently under study. ① The cause of rising prices is the currency problem, but Japan's currency, due to the Bank of Japan's measures, will not expand so much, so there is no fear of malignant inflation. ① As a result of the implementation of the exchange control order, although there are many inconveniences for two or three speculative importers, there is no disadvantage for general importers, so there is no intention to revoke this order at present. ① As for measures against rising prices, we do not want to adopt overly artificial means, but should examine various causes and take appropriate countermeasures to maintain price stability.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Lin replied:</p>
<p>Although I feel the need to properly control industries, I have no intention of nationalizing various industries. When there are opportunities for a world conference on resource redistribution, I will gladly participate and explain the government's beliefs.</p>
<p>Regarding the Manchurian Policy from Now On</p>
<p>After Mr. Eio Morio of the Shōwakai asked questions about the Manchurian policy, Minister of the Army Matsuyama responded as follows:</p>
<p>The current state of "Manchukuo" cannot maintain security without military force. Minister of Colonial Affairs Yūki responded:</p>
<p>To enable "Manchukuo" to develop soundly, not only agricultural immigrants but also many excellent citizens must immigrate. I also agree with this.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Lin replied:</p>
<p>The Manchurian policy must be parallel to the security policy. In order to gain people's hearts and stabilize the people's minds, it is necessary to build a policy of appeasement.</p>
<p>Kawakami Asks Four Questions</p>
<p>Next, Buntarō Kawakami of the Social Masses Party asked questions, generally saying that recently Japan has been obscured by various dark clouds, all latent in the course of the February 26th Incident. I believe that the course of this incident should be reported to the Diet and await the judgment of the people, which should be a shortcut to military reform. What are the views of the military authorities? It is also said that General Ugaki's cabinet formation is considered an obstacle to military reform. To what extent has military reform progressed? The military authorities often call for military reform and forcibly demand the withdrawal of members of the Japan Labor Federation, which is contrary to constitutional freedom.</p>
<p>The military has published a pamphlet promoting the rescue of rural villages in order to establish broad national defense, but the budget for the Shōwa 12th year is completely contrary to this claim. Do the military authorities intend to give up a portion of the budget for the urgent needs of rural villages? As for the budget for investigation and revision, the direct tax is light and the indirect tax is heavy. Is this the fundamental policy of increasing taxes? If so, Finance Minister Yūki is sacrificing rural villages to support Japanese capitalism, and is a proxy for financial capitalists. The so-called Yūki Finance is Yūki plus Ikeda Finance. The major dollar buyers directly induced by the May 15th Incident are still present and are a major key to the future of Japanese capitalism. Finance Minister Yūki, who is called a financial fascist in the world, if he does not believe in this, please express his views frankly and boldly.</p>
<p>The first policy to overcome the difficulties of the country at this time is national unity. I do not know whether the Prime Minister has the belief in deliberating politics and administering affairs with the public, but the fundamental meaning of reforming politics, I believe, is to expand and strengthen the authority of the Imperial Diet. What does Prime Minister Lin believe?</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Matsuyama replied:</p>
<p>The February 26th Incident has not yet been fully deliberated, so it is not convenient to report its course. There will be opportunities to report all information in the future. There is no fact to hinder General Ugaki's cabinet formation. The Army has recommended suitable personnel, but the person himself refused to accept it. The dissolution of the Labor Federation is based on the Army's own request to facilitate military reform. There is no intention to cut military spending at all.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yūki replied:</p>
<p>The Japanese Empire is now faced with the urgent task of national defense, and the foundation of national defense is the people. In this sense, stabilizing the people's lives is essential. Under the same circumstances, expanding production is also necessary, and promoting overseas trade is also necessary. It is necessary to establish a financial strategy based on these circumstances. I believe that this is the only way to do it. I am not a supporter of capitalism. The reduction of consumption tax in the budget revision案 is larger than the reduction of direct tax, which can also be clearly stated.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Lin replied:</p>
<p>Respecting public opinion and following public sentiment in order to carry out fair politics is stated in the party platform, and we will carry out a reform of politics with the people. (Dōmei Electric)</p>
<h3>Japan Brews a New Political Tide</h3>
<p>The attitude of political parties against the military remains unchanged. The Seiyūkai has internal strife over the president's issue.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] A new political tide is brewing in Japan. When the House of Representatives met yesterday, after submitting many lengthy questions opposing the Army, Army Minister Gen Sugiyama and Army Vice-Minister Imai and other leaders gathered in the meeting lounge after the meeting. It is heard that they decided to take a tough stance on the House of Representatives' sentiments against the Army, and disregarded the precedent of the collapse of the Hirota Cabinet on January 23. The various political parties are still working hard to oppose the Army, showing a determination to separate the Army from the Navy and the entire country. Observers predict that unless the political parties change their strategies, the Army will soon make a request to dissolve the Diet again. (Central News Agency 17th Reuters)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The reformists within the Seiyūkai, taking the opportunity of President Suzuki's expression of resignation, demanded the immediate establishment of an organ to replace the president and began a vigorous movement to expel the cadre faction. The faction close to President Suzuki, including Ichirō Hatoyama, believes that the establishment of a acting organ is a prerequisite for President Suzuki to remain in office. According to the Seiyūkai party rules, a president must be established in the party, and the president may establish a acting organ at any time if necessary. Therefore, the acting organ established now inevitably has a temporary nature. After the president resigns, the current general affairs should be the center, and the cadres should handle all party affairs. The cadre faction's opinion completely conflicts with the reformists. The reformists plan to amend the party rules to temporarily disregard the party rules, advocate the establishment of a acting organ, and are willing to split the party from the cadre faction if necessary. From this point of view, the Seiyūkai will continue to be in turmoil for the time being with the establishment of a acting organ as the center. (17th Dōmei Electric)</p>

<h3>Japanese Finance Minister Attends Budget General Meeting</h3>
<p>Explanation of Budget Amendment</p>
<p>[Tokyo] At the first day of the House of Representatives' Budget General Meeting on the 17th, Finance Minister Yūki explained the issues of the Shōwa 12th year's actual budget. The main points are as follows: The current cabinet has no room to change the compilation of the Shōwa 12th year's revenue and expenditure budget, so it is inevitable to submit the previously withdrawn budget as it is. However, the government believes that abandoning the budget of the previous cabinet is inappropriate given the recent reality of Japan's economic circles. Therefore, changes will be made during implementation. Among these changes, those that require budget amendment will be handled as soon as preparations are completed. The total budget for the 12th year currently submitted to the Diet is 3,038.5 million yen for both revenue and expenditure, of which 269.2 million yen is planned to be used for expenditure. For revenue, the tax system reform and tariff system reform planned by the previous cabinet will also be carefully considered again. For the time being, according to the provisional plan, the revenue will inevitably decrease considerably. However, the actual budget amount for the 12th year is 2,769.35 million yen for both revenue and expenditure, which is an increase of 463.7 million yen in revenue and 457.8 million yen in expenditure compared to the actual budget for the previous year. First, I will generally explain the actual budget amount of revenue. The ordinary revenue is 2,043.1 million yen. The amount of this submitted budget has decreased by 193 million yen, but it has increased by 441.34 million yen compared to the actual budget of the previous year. The increased amount is roughly based on the plan to increase the temporary tax, create new taxes, and other revenue increase plans. The content of this revenue increase plan is 269.54 million yen due to the increase in the temporary tax and the creation of new taxes, 25.4 million yen due to the revision of the tobacco selling price, and 67.8 million yen due to the incorporation of the special account into the general revenue source, for a total of 362.94 million yen. In addition, there is an increase of 22.5 million yen due to the revision of tariffs. Next, regarding expenditure, in view of the recent trend of rising prices, based on the principle of suppressing the increase in government material needs and easing private material needs, the amount of expenditure budget is suspended for 269.2 million yen. This has already been explained. The so-called suspension of use means not using the budget within the year. The method is to suspend the project, reduce the amount, or extend it to the next year. Those that can be amended will be amended. Also, when deciding on the amount of expenditure budget to be suspended, the policy of respecting the purpose of enriching national defense, promoting industry, and stabilizing national life must be adopted. In addition, a considerable amount will be suspended for the special account expenditure. At the same time, the foreign special account is related to the general account, and changes will also be made to tax and tariff revenue. Although the amount of suspension of the special account expenditure is nominally a considerable amount, it is actually only about 18 million yen in total. Finally, the amount of public bonds issued to cover the revenue source of the 12th year's expenditure, the actual budget amount, is 726.2 million yen for the general account and 143 million yen for the special account, for a total of 869.2 million yen. The amount of this submitted budget has decreased by 76.1 million yen for the general account and 12 million yen for the special account. (10th Dōmei Electric)</p>
<h3>British Government Announces National Defense Plan White Paper</h3>
<p>Stepping up the expansion of naval, land, and air forces. 1.5 billion pounds needed within five years.</p>
<p>[London] The government recently published a white paper explaining the national defense procedures and stipulating the main points of the large-scale military innovation method as follows: ① In the next fiscal year, the navy will build three battleships, seven cruisers, and two aircraft carriers. ② The army will add a tank battalion. ③ Increase the number of air force personnel. ④ Open many airports in the headquarters and various autonomous territories. (16th Havas Electric)</p>
<p>[London] The white paper published by the British government today estimates that the cost of national defense and military preparations within five years will reach 1.5 billion pounds. (16th National Electric)</p>
<p>[London] The white paper on the British government's proposal to the parliament to expand military preparations and strengthen national defense was published tonight, containing details of the entire national defense plan. The white paper stated that although the government requested authorization to borrow 400 million pounds, this number does not need to be fully exhausted. However, the total national defense expenses within the next five years, based on the most prudent estimate, will require at least 1.5 billion pounds. The so-called total expenses are the number of ordinary estimates in five years, plus 400 million pounds of national defense bonds. The white paper further put forward the reasons why this new plan must be implemented. In recent years, the mechanical equipment in the military preparations of various countries in the world has seen an unlimited increase in precision, and the needs of the latest equipment and air defense equipment are the same for all countries. Moreover, the British territory is scattered and distributed very far. The supplies that the country needs from overseas must be transported by sea. All of these emphasize the strength of the British military. The Navy must maintain the safety of transportation, and its responsibility is especially important. The modernization of the defense of militarily important locations in various territories of the British Empire is also one of the most important aspects of the national defense plan. The white paper then described the needs of the army, navy, and air force individually, and discussed the capacity of reserve manufacturing plants and the defense issues of the country and overseas. It also stated that what Britain needs now is that various issues should be dealt with in a flexible way, so that after the international situation changes or scientific research and inventions are intensified, they can be changed immediately to adapt to the environment.</p>
<p>Regarding the navy, the book stated that in the next few years, the country will have to implement a major construction plan. In addition to the two battleships worth 8 million pounds currently under construction, three more ships must be added in the 1937-1938 program. The plan this year will also add seven cruisers and two aircraft carriers. From 1931 to 1934, the average annual number of naval construction programs was about 12 million pounds, but it increased to 50 million pounds in 1936, and the needs this year will have a sharp increase.</p>
<p>For the army, it is planned to reorganize two tank regiments and corresponding auxiliary military forces to complete modern military forces so that they can effectively respond on the battlefield. The maintenance expenses occupy a large number according to the new plan to improve the army's situation, and the mechanization of various parts is also being accelerated. There is also a considerable plan for the large-scale storage of military supplies, so that the military needs resources will not be cut off for several months after the war, before production can be increased.</p>
<p>Regarding the air force, the white paper advocates the construction of a large number of airports, and plans to build 75 mobile training and other air stations in various locations at home and abroad. The number of British air force personnel has increased from 31,000 in 1934 to 50,000 in 1936, and this number must have a huge increase.</p>
<p>The white paper also has a plan for the construction of military supplies and the latent storage of military supplies in preparation for unexpected needs. In addition, there is a so-called shadowy aircraft manufacturing plant that can supply a large number of aircraft in an emergency. Furthermore, state-owned industries related to national defense should also be prevented from being abandoned due to the interruption of major raw materials. Therefore, the storage of major items such as fuel is also very costly.</p>
<p>Regarding the national defense plan, the white paper stated that the original two divisions of the British territorial army have now been reorganized and expanded, and several new territorial army corps headquarters will be built in the new recruitment locations of the territorial army. In addition, the balloon covering team is also increasing the number of balloons. The protection of the people, such as the supply of gas masks and the increase of fire-fighting equipment, are important tools for defending against the danger of incendiary bombs, so they are all being planned. As for the defense of overseas bases, the air defense equipment should be increased, and the increase of anti-aircraft guns and searchlights in various overseas ports are necessary for protection. The modernization of the coastal defense force at home and abroad requires huge investment.</p>
<p>The white paper stated, "Since the government began the plan to expand military preparations, the external environment related to the scope and speed of this plan has not shown any signs of improvement. Therefore, the government believes that in this phenomenon, the plan for military building cannot be reduced or slowed down for the time being."</p>
<p>The white paper continued, "The government firmly believes that this kind of military expansion plan is of great benefit to the future of peace, and all citizens should do their best to support it. Therefore, although 'the Emperor's government regrets the expenses required for this military preparation and other defense plans, it is indeed aware that it must be implemented. The government is half due to the pressure of the current environment and half due to the fact that the government has needed less financial resources for national defense in previous years, so today it has to catch up urgently. However, it feels difficult to implement and feels unfair to impose the full burden of compensating for this shortcoming in a short period of five years on taxpayers in this period. What comforts the Emperor's government is that in proposing to spread a part of this expense over a longer period, it deeply feels that its path is fully pure." The white paper again solemnly stated that this plan must be implemented before the national defense strength can restore its safe level. (Central News Agency 16th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Parisian Sympathy</h3>
<p>[Paris] Today, people in Paris feel that the great efforts of British national defense will surely have a beneficial effect. The action of Britain not wanting to make the freedom of the ocean a mere empty word is now welcomed by the French. The British military preparation program, although it shows that it can only place a minimum number of troops into the battlefield, its program of making huge preparations for armaments is called by Paris a far-sighted precaution. (Central News Agency 16th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Roman Surprise</h3>
<p>[Rome] The Italian people are deeply impressed by the great determination of the British government to make up for its shortcomings in military preparations, and they are surprised by the huge amount of funds required. They all feel that the United Kingdom and France are now raising the arms race to the highest level, making it impossible for the poorer powers to catch up. Italians are now all afraid of the extent to which the arms race continues. (Central News Agency 16th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Berlin's Fear</h3>
<p>[Berlin] A German government spokesman commented on the British military program today, saying that Germany does not deny the right of the United Kingdom to expand its military preparations to the extent it deems necessary, and only asks that Germany should also enjoy the same right. However, Germany deeply believes that the position of the United Kingdom is far less dangerous than that of Germany, and it is incomprehensible why it is expanding its military preparations so greatly now. Therefore, political circles are now asking each other, "Where will all these actions lead? Will countries such as Italy, France, and Soviet Russia not follow in the footsteps of the United Kingdom?" (Central News Agency 16th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japanese Concern</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese naval circles have admitted that they are extremely concerned since the British announced their plan to expand military preparations, and will pay close attention to the subsequent developments. They believe that the British decision to build three battleships and seven cruisers is a reaction to the expansion of the German navy, and predict that the United States will also implement an expansion plan to compete with the British plan. However, the Japanese navy has no intention of seeking equality with the United Kingdom and the United States. On the one hand, it is stated that Japan's purpose is only to enrich its military preparations on the independent foundation of not being threatened and not invading, and that the military strength of Japan must be able to cope with the maintenance of peace in the Far East and the authority in the western Pacific. However, the so-called military preparations only have a relative value. Now that the United Kingdom has held a huge construction plan, and the United States will inevitably track down and advance, Japan will be forced by the environment in the future and will have to catch up urgently. (Central News Agency 17th Reuters)</p>
<h3>British National Defense Bond Proposal Submitted to the Lower House</h3>
<p>Debate Began Yesterday</p>
<p>[London] Since the publication of the British government's white paper, the huge expenditure on British national defense has become an important topic of conversation in the parliament's lounges. The government is confident that this great strategy will surely win the ordinary support of those who support the government, but the opposition feels that a large increase in taxes will be inevitable, and therefore expresses pessimism. The debate on this proposal will begin today for two days. At that time, Finance Minister Chamberlain will put forward a resolution on national defense bonds, and it is heard that the most important criticism of the Labor Party will be that the white paper has not put forward any adjustment plan for national defense. (Central News Agency 17th Reuters)</p>
<h3>US Neutrality Act</h3>
<p>Will be passed by Congress early. The Navy maintains equality with the UK.</p>
<p>[Washington] The impact of Britain's move to raise huge funds for national defense will cause the US Congress to pass the Neutrality Act early. Many congressmen said that if there were no alarming British preparations, the situation in Europe would definitely be explosive. Non-official circles all expect that the US Navy will continue to maintain its equal status with Britain. However, this decision will probably not be announced until the report of the current case between the US government and steel manufacturers is released. Since steel manufacturers stopped supplying steel to US naval shipyards, the US shipbuilding program has been temporarily suspended. (Central News Agency 16th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Baldwin expected to retire after the coronation of the British Emperor</h3>
<p>Chamberlain succeeds as Prime Minister</p>
<p>[London] The public initially believed that Prime Minister Baldwin would remain in office until the end of the parliament's summer recess, but political circles are now unanimously believed that Baldwin will resign immediately after the coronation of the Emperor, which can be predicted. Also, Privy Council Minister MacDonald and Lord Chancellor Hailsham also intend to resign. Hailsham's physical condition has been unsuitable for the past year, and MacDonald feels quite inconvenient due to eye disease. If Baldwin resigns, then Finance Minister Chamberlain will succeed him, which is needless to say. However, there are many opinions on who will be the finance minister, and there is no consensus. Naval Minister Hoare and Home Secretary Simon seem to be the most promising. The public all believe that Simon will be ennobled and succeed Hailsham as Lord Chancellor. If so, then the Commerce Secretary has the possibility of entering the Ministry of Finance. He is very steady and is loved by the public. If Simon is in charge of finance, it will involve special problems, so it is feared that it will not be realized. It is expected that the cabinet members who will be changed are Army Minister Cooper and Labor Minister Brown. The public also expects that if MacDonald resigns, Chamberlain will recruit a member of the National Labor Party into the cabinet to maintain the cabinet's academic unity. The only thing that can be decided now is that Chamberlain has a plan in mind, and he will have very clear motions for whatever he wants to do. (Central News Agency 7th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Progress on the Non-Intervention Committee's Work Regarding the Spanish Civil War</h3>
<p>Subcommittee Passes Two Resolutions: Ban on Volunteers Effective This Saturday; Portugal Raises Reservations on Maritime and Land Monitoring Plan</p>
<p>[London] The Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War held a plenary session this afternoon and adopted two resolutions passed by the subcommittee yesterday: ① The ban on sending volunteers to Spain will take effect on Saturday, the 20th of this month; ② The monitoring plan for the non-intervention measures will take effect on March 6th. Today's meeting was brief. The German representative, Ambassador to the UK Herr von Ribbentrop, spoke first, announcing Germany's acceptance of the above measures. Subsequently, the Italian representative, Ambassador to the UK Count Grandi, issued a similar statement, sarcastically mentioning the news reported in the British newspapers (namely, that the agreement on the ban on volunteers was reached because the French representative in the subcommittee expressed a strong attitude). The Portuguese representative, Monteiro, speaking after Grandi, expressed acceptance of the ban on volunteers, but raised reservations regarding the implementation of the monitoring plan. Optimists believe that Portugal will only temporarily stay out of it and will eventually participate when the monitoring plan is implemented. Pessimists, however, believe that Portugal will maintain its opposition to the monitoring plan from beginning to end. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Southeast of Madrid</h3>
<p>Rebel Forces Launch Three Fierce Attacks, All Repelled by Defending Troops</p>
<p>Valencia: According to news from the Spanish government, the major battle, spanning twenty miles southeast of Madrid, has now entered its second week. Madrid seems to be becoming the second Verdun. The government claims that the rebels have suffered 6,000 casualties in the past few days of heavy fighting. The battle is currently taking place on the plateau overlooking the Arganda Bridge. Government troops are still firmly defending the bridge. According to photographs obtained by the government forces, among the rebel casualties are 2,000 Germans. Meanwhile, it is reported that at several points along the Biscay front, soldiers from both sides gather around campfires every night, singing and making merry, which is a stark contrast to the hardship and suffering of the troops on the Madrid front. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Nationalist forces launched three successive attacks yesterday in the vicinity of Jarama, southeast of Madrid. The attacks were extremely fierce, but all were repelled by government troops. It is anticipated that government troops will launch a counter-offensive today. The Nationalist forces' three attacks yesterday unfolded as follows: In the first attack, the Nationalist forces first bombarded with artillery for a long time, and then launched a tank assault, followed by an infantry charge. The infantry units used very effective automatic weapons. The fighting lasted for two hours and was extremely fierce, but the government troops remained unmoved, and there was no change in the original positions. Before long, the Nationalist forces launched a second attack, but this time without a tank assault, and were eventually repulsed by the government troops' sweeping fire and failed to succeed. The Nationalist forces then reorganized their troops and launched a third attack, but the result was again defeat. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Disaster in Malaga; Residents Flee in Destitution</h3>
<p>Valencia: Spanish Minister of Justice Oriol, under government orders, issued a report describing the suffering of 100,000 residents of Malaga who were fleeing to Almeria to escape the rebel forces. Oriol stated that this evacuation was an unprecedented human disaster in European history. During their flight to Almeria, the refugees were subjected to naval bombardment, aerial bombing, and machine-gun fire from tanks. Corpses littered the roads. Many refugees, unable to walk due to exhaustion, first strangled their children to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Fascists, and then killed themselves by hitting their heads against stones or lying in the road to be crushed by trucks. Many children were separated from their parents and trampled to death by the crowds. Some refugees, unable to lift their feet, crawled on their knees, leaving traces of blood behind them. Severe shortages of food and drink further increased their suffering. Upon reaching Almeria, the refugees, unable to find accommodation, mostly slept on the roadside. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Avila: According to the latest news, government troops executed more than 10,000 prisoners before withdrawing from the port of Malaga. Since the port fell into the hands of the Nationalist forces, residents have been experiencing shortages of food and clothing. Several ships, fully loaded with clothing and food, have arrived at the port to provide relief. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>International Eucharistic Congress Held in the Philippines</h3>
<p>— Philippine Correspondence</p>
<p>Representatives from Over Fifty Countries Participate in Large Numbers; Philippine Immigration Department Obstructs the Landing of Our Representatives; Consul-General to the Philippines Protests to the Immigration Department</p>
<p>The Philippines is the only Catholic country in the East, having been governed by Spain for three hundred years and influenced by its culture and education. Except for a small number of Muslim ethnic groups in the south, the rest are Catholics. The current president, vice president, and key figures in the political arena all believe in Catholicism. Private universities, such as Santo Tomas, Ateneo, San Beda, La Salle, etc., have histories of hundreds or hundreds of years and were all established by clergy from various religious orders. The clergy class in the East is most respected in the Philippines, with one Apostolic Delegate, two Archbishops, ten Bishops, one Vicar Apostolic, and two Prefects Apostolic. This year's International Eucharistic Congress is being held in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, because the Philippines is a newly emerging country with convenient transportation, developed commerce, a mild climate, and beautiful scenery, possessing favorable conditions in terms of time, location, and people.</p>
<p>The congress was originally scheduled to open on February 3rd. A grand venue, capable of seating 100,000 people, was constructed in New Manila, with equipment costing nearly 100,000 pesos. Hundreds of large incandescent electric lamps were installed in the venue, and dozens of loudspeakers were hung. From the afternoon of the 3rd, when the congress opened, until the afternoon of the 7th, when it closed, believers attended Mass in their respective parishes after 1:00 AM every night. From 6:00 AM in the morning to 6:00 PM in the afternoon, they attended High Mass at the main venue. The 4th was designated as Women's Day, the 5th as Men's Day, the 6th as Children's Day, and the 7th as the Day of Blessing for the Masses. More than 100,000 believers participated in the processions. Because of religious obligations, each meeting was solemn and reverent. Many believers knelt for one or two hours to receive the Gospel. Before the congress opened, the colorful chapels in each city district and town were freshly painted. The government also strongly promoted the event. During the congress, all government agencies and schools suspended operations for half a day. The American and Philippine national flags and the congress emblem were hung from the windows of residences and on lampposts along major streets, fluttering in the wind. Cars displayed small American and Philippine national flags and the congress emblem, traveling on the main thoroughfares. The believers were highly excited, considering the rare opportunity to attend such a grand event, and were willing to spend whatever it took. Therefore, seats near the stage in the main venue, which accommodated six people, were booked for as much as 500 Philippine pesos.</p>
<p>Manila, a city with over 200,000 residents, suddenly saw an influx of nearly 50,000 to 60,000 tourists (many believers from the outer provinces also came to the capital for the pilgrimage). Various foods were in greater demand than supply. In restaurants and tea houses, both large and small, latecomers had no place to stand. The hotel industry, in particular, was unable to expand to meet the appropriate needs. Therefore, Italian ships from Europe, Russian Empress ships from America, Anqing ships from Xiamen, and Twelve Ports ships from Java were specially docked in the harbor for four or five days, serving as temporary hotels for the delegations. It is said that the fares for their berths were specially discounted as a gesture of preferential treatment. After the congress closed, the delegations returned to their home countries on the original ships.</p>
<p>Our country's representatives, such as Lu Bohong from Shanghai and Yu Bin from Nanjing, held very high ranks in the Catholic Church and had been granted titles. Before their arrival, President Quezon had sent a letter cordially inviting them to stay at the Presidential Palace as honored guests. Unexpectedly, when they arrived in Manila at 7:30 AM on January 20th, the first day along with representatives from other countries, our Consul-General to the Philippines and the Chinese community welcoming committee saw the representatives of other countries stride proudly ashore. Only our country's representatives, Lu and Yu, were detained by the immigration department at the new passenger detention center to verify their passports and interrogate them before being released. Otherwise, each person had to pay a guarantee of 1,000 pesos. After repeated negotiations by the Consul-General and the head of the Eucharistic Congress Preparatory Committee, the immigration department still did not relent. They were only allowed to disembark at 9:30 AM after the Consulate General provided a temporary guarantee in its name. God advocates equality and universal love. Our country's representatives were subjected to such unfair treatment, which deeply saddened the overseas Chinese due to the low international standing of our country.</p>
<p>This matter concerns international prestige and cannot be easily let go. Therefore, the Consul-General sent another letter to the immigration department after the event, raising two main points: ① The members of the Chinese pilgrimage group held sixth-class entry certificates, which had been rigorously verified by the American Consul. Why should each person still be forced to pay a guarantee of 1,000 pesos? This is excessive and unreasonable. ② Lu and Yu are senior leaders of the Catholic Church, holding certificates issued by the American Consul in Shanghai and wearing cassocks and insignia, indicating their high position in the Church. They were also identified by representatives of the Eucharistic Congress Preparatory Office. Yet, they were still obstructed for two hours. The American spirit of refusing Chinese entry is only to refuse Chinese laborers. Since the Chinese hold valid certificates and are not laborers, they should not be prevented from landing. Furthermore, Lu and Yu hold very high positions and should be accorded due respect.</p>
<p>In summary, since the transfer of the Immigration Bureau to the management of the Ministry of Labor, the entry of Chinese children has been nitpicked. Unexpectedly, this has insulted our country's delegation, which is related to international prestige. This shows that the Filipinos' repeated claims of goodwill and improving the treatment of immigrants to us (in reality, the current immigration laws are even more stringent) are merely superficial.</p>
<h3>People in Counties Along the Yangtze River in Hubei Province Oppose Hunan Province Blocking Dongting Lake</h3>
<p>The Lives and Deaths of Hubei People Are at Stake and They Cannot Help But Protest; Jointly Telegraphing the Central Government to Immediately Stop It</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Regarding Hunan Province's construction of the Tianhu Embankment, encroaching on 13% of the area of Dongting Lake and blocking the four river outlets, it has caused criticism from the people of Hunan and Hubei provinces. The counties along the Yangtze River in Hubei Province are particularly concerned with their lives and deaths and cannot sit idly by. Today, the entire government agencies and legal organizations in the counties, jointly sent a telegram, resolutely opposing it and requesting the Central Government to immediately stop it. The original telegram is as follows: Hubei's terrain is low-lying, and the Yangtze River runs through the entire province. The counties along the coast rely on embankments for their survival. Since the old courses of the Nine Openings and Thirteen Outlets cannot be fully restored, we can only rely on the existing four openings of Ouchi, Songzi, Taiping, and Tiaoxian to divert water into Dongting Lake, thereby alleviating the momentum of the surging waves. In recent years, residents along the shores of Dongting Lake have built embankments and reclaimed land, reducing the area for water storage, while the disasters of embankment breaches in Hubei have increased. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek proposed returning farmland to the lake, which can be said to be a crucial suggestion and a merit for all generations. The total flow of the above four outlets during floods is 37,100 cubic meters per second, which is stored in Dongting Lake and converges with the nine rivers, entering the Yangtze River within the borders of Hubei Province through Chenglingji. This is exactly in accordance with the old course of the Yu Gong waterway, and the floods in the counties of Hubei and the areas of Anxiang, Li, and Nanhua in Hunan can be slightly alleviated. However, recently it has been heard that the people of Hunan Province are arbitrarily building embankments within the Ouchi estuary, hoping to reclaim the lake as farmland. This is not only completely contrary to the policy of returning farmland to the lake, but also extremely contrary to historical trends and national laws. According to the Yu Gong, the Minshan Mountains guided the Yangtze River to the east and branched into the Tuo River, and then east to the Li River, passing through Jiujiang to Dongling. According to the records, the water from the river flows out as the Tuo and Li Rivers, which is now Lixian, and Jiujiang is Dongting Lake, named after the confluence of the nine rivers. Dongling is now Baling. Although the Tuo River is now silted up, the four openings of Ouchi, etc., still have the effect of dividing the river flow eastward to Baling. When the water level is extremely high, there may be slight damage to the newly silted fields in Dongting Lake. However, when the water recedes slightly, it is no longer possible to divert the population. If embankments are built to block the flow, the only beneficiaries will be the very few silted lands of Dongting, while Hubei will suffer, affecting as many as twenty or more counties. According to the historical course of the river flow and the current situation, it is not appropriate to build embankments. One is that rivers are owned by the state and should not be occupied by the people. The criminal law has specific provisions for the crime of blocking waterways. Even from the perspective of civil law, the owner of land through which water flows does not have the right to unilaterally change the water flow or width. The four openings are natural rivers. How can the people of Hunan Province secretly make them their private property? Now, they are illegally blocking the flow, causing Hubei to lose the benefit of Dongting Lake's water storage and suffer solely from the flood flow from the entire Hunan Province. If the people of Hubei follow suit and build a giant dam on the silted sandbars of Jinghe Township, preventing the water of the Chenglingji River from flowing smoothly to the northeast, would the government sanction it? Can the people of Hunan allow it? According to the law, it is not appropriate to build embankments. Two is that, in general, the land and people of Hunan and Hubei provinces are equally under the jurisdiction of the national government and should be treated equally. The people of Hunan should not harm their neighbors for their own private interests, causing the national taxes and the lives of the people in more than twenty counties in Hubei to be completely subject to the waves. As for how to dredge the four openings, how to implement the return of farmland to the lake, and how to dredge the riverbeds below Jingnao, the government should have a plan. We will not go into detail. The matter concerns the lives and deaths of the people of Hubei. The situation is urgent. We earnestly request your examination and approval and a swift plan to stop it. We cannot express enough our expectation of your orders. (February 15th)</p>

<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Preventing a Theatrical Performance Leads to Beating</p>
<p>Farmers in Lujiapu Village, Sixth District, planned to put on a religious opera during the Lunar New Year, having collected funds for it. The village chief, Wu Yanzhen, found out and went to dissuade them. Unexpectedly, they disagreed and swarmed him, beating village chief Wu and causing injuries. The Chenmu Police Station, under whose jurisdiction the incident occurred, arrested six people, including the instigator Zhu Yongnian, and brought them to the county for interrogation and punishment.</p>
<p>Summoning Township Chiefs for Discussions</p>
<p>In order to improve the Baojia system and promote local autonomy, the county government decided to summon township chiefs from across the county in batches, starting on the 23rd, to come to the county for discussions. The main points of this discussion will focus on the implementation of local reforms. If there are any insights or difficulties, they can be fully stated for reference and improvement.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Execution of Notorious Lake Tai Bandit</p>
<p>The Joint Defense Office of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Water Police in Wujiang dispatched detectives to Suzhou in November last year and captured Ren Caifeng, a notorious bandit from Lake Tai, outside Panmen. He was taken to Wujiang for interrogation. He confessed to multiple robberies of the Chen family in Jiangyin, the Zhang family in Wuxi, and the Chen family in Dongshan. He was deemed to have committed heinous crimes and sentenced to death. After being approved by the Military Affairs Commission, he was tied up and executed by firing squad outside the East Gate of Wujiang County on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Widening of Main Roads Commences</p>
<p>The county has stipulated that the widening of the city's first main road, from the South Gate to the North Gate via the downtown area south of the county and the West Alley, will be uniformly widened to ten meters. The entire North Gate Street commenced construction on February 1st and is mostly completed. It is expected to see a spacious avenue soon. Other sections were suspended for several days due to the Lunar New Year. Now that the fifth day of the Lunar New Year has passed, workers have returned and will continue with the second phase of work. The removal of the West Alley to the North Downtown is expected to start next month. Large government agencies and commercial enterprises such as the post office and telegraph office have found relocation sites. The construction project of the north and south gates will be changed to six meters in the style of Suzhou's Fengmen Gate. The entire line of the project is expected to be completed by the end of April. From then on, cars from outside the city can directly reach the northern suburbs through the city.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Major Fire at Lihua Textile Factory</p>
<p>The Lihua Textile Factory, located in Yingshanhe, in the city, was founded by local residents Cheng Jingtang and Tang Xiangting. It was a large-scale operation, and its business had been profitable over the years. At the end of last Lunar New Year, the total profit was more than 100,000 yuan. Recently, the factory had newly acquired a large batch of cotton yarn, preparing for half a year's use. Unexpectedly, around midnight of the 16th, a fire suddenly broke out in the raw material warehouse of the spinning workshop on the first floor. At the time, all the employees in the factory were unaware. It was only after hearing the alarm bell that they woke up from their dreams and escaped through the windows. However, the fire had already broken through the roof, and in an instant, the flames soared to the sky, spreading throughout the factory and making it impossible to approach. Fire brigades from all sections rushed to the scene to put out the fire. Unfortunately, the flames were raging and could not be extinguished easily. It was not until about 2:00 AM that the fire was extinguished. However, in addition to the complete destruction of all the buildings in the factory, the internal machinery, including 30 iron weaving machines, 40 power looms, more than 20 drawing frames, and warping machines, were all reduced to ashes. The total loss is estimated to be over 200,000 yuan. Afterwards, the factory's board of directors and managers met in the store to discuss the aftermath. It was reported that the factory had fire insurance of 70,000 yuan, so there should be no major problems.</p>
<h3>Liyang</h3>
<p>A Tragic Accident Caused by a Circus Performance</p>
<p>A circus troupe came to Liyang to perform during the Lunar New Year, borrowing a site on the open space across the river from the East Park. They had also filed a report with the authorities. However, the river could not be crossed without a bridge, so they hired carpenter Liu Changgao to contract the wooden materials and labor for a total of forty yuan. After the construction department inspected it, it began operating. For several days, visitors came in droves. Unexpectedly, at about 11:00 AM on the 16th, the bridge collapsed with a loud crash due to the bridge planks being too thin and too many pedestrians. The bridge body also collapsed. More than 100 people fell into the water at once. Fortunately, the rescue came early, and many people were rescued. A small boat was hired to carry out the rescue. A total of six or seven people were injured and were taken to the county hospital for treatment. The search continued. A villager brought two children. They also fell into the water while crossing the bridge. Although one child was rescued ashore, the other two children were still missing. Some villagers, seeing this, believed that the circus was the cause of the disaster and tore down the cloth tents. The authorities rushed to the scene after hearing the news and, seeing that the disaster had occurred, immediately took the villagers who had torn down the cloth tents to the county for detention. It is reported that the circus came to Liyang to perform and reached a compromise with a certain agency, but the bridge was so flimsy and no one cared about it, causing this tragedy. All those involved should bear considerable responsibility.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Planning to Establish a Large-Scale Silk Factory</p>
<p>In view of the decline of the silk industry in Jiangsu Province, in order to revive this industry, the province has implemented unified control of silkworm cocoon trading since the autumn of the 23rd year. For three years, the quality and output have been improving day by day. Silk factories and silkworm farmers are no longer as pessimistic as before, and they are regaining their interest in silkworm farming. Although silk cocoon prices have not recovered to their old levels due to the world market, it is not difficult to restore the silk industry in the province to its former glory if we continue to move forward. However, in terms of silk reeling, although we are striving to cooperate with each factory, the reform of silk-making machinery is more costly. It is not easy to carry out without a farsighted vision and strong financial resources. Moreover, commercial management rarely involves large-scale experiments and research on the relationship between varieties and silk quality. In terms of the purpose of promotion and encouragement, there also seems to be a lack of basis. Therefore, the provincial construction department should include a budget of 100,000 yuan each year in the silk improvement project funds for the 25th and 26th years to establish a provincial silk reeling factory. In order to develop the silkworm industry in Jiangbei, the factory site is planned to be located near Jinshan Temple in Yongdong Township, First District, Zhenjiang. The equipment cost is set at 200,000 yuan, purchasing 180 new-style multi-spindle rotary silk reeling machines. In addition to the capital allocated by the province, the operating policy should be independent and not receive subsidies. Therefore, the annual work is planned to be 80% commercial operation, 10% experimental research, and 10% reeling on behalf of cooperative societies in the province. The entire plan has been approved by the provincial government meeting, and the construction department has now sent personnel to actively prepare and will be realized in the first half of this year.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Collection of 900,000 Yuan in Land Tax</p>
<p>The land tax arrears in Tongyi County have been high for many years. The county government organized a committee to urge the payment of arrears and collected them household by household. As of February 10th, a total of 900,000 yuan in new and old land taxes has been collected. The Land Administration Bureau has completed the land registration, and the land price tax for this year can be collected according to the register. In the future, tax collection can avoid all kinds of difficulties.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Ferocious Bandits on the Zhejiang Border Are All Captured</p>
<p>The Commander-in-Chief Headquarters for Suppressing Bandits in the border area of Weichang, Kai, Sui, and Chunshou counties has achieved victory since the start of the encirclement and suppression in October, annihilating many bandits. On the 13th, more than 100 bandits from the roaming bandit group in Fuman Mountain, armed with eighty rifles, fled south from the northwest of Suian. Commander Lu reported this and secretly ordered the Li and Tang regiments to send a part of their troops to set up an ambush, surround, and attack. They captured a fake company commander alive, killed five or sixty bandits, seized more than thirty rifles, and rescued many hostages and captured bandits. Lao Zhu (Zhu Xuexin), a well-known ferocious bandit who was the Central Committee member of the bandit forces, has now been captured on the border of Shouchang and sent to the county for interrogation and punishment. Yu Dabing, a notorious bandit in Shouchang, has also been captured and will be severely punished as a warning.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Kidnapping Case Occurs in Shuanglin Town</p>
<p>At about 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, several bandits armed with wooden-cased guns and speaking with mixed accents suddenly broke into the Zhang Gonghe Rice Shop in Hongqiao, East Zha, Shuanglin Town. They kidnapped the shop owner, Zhang Hecheng, and pushed him into a boat that had been ambushed nearby and sped away towards Lianshi. Afterwards, the shop's partners reported to the town's aquatic and land doctors. The Security Corps immediately dispatched a team on the Bihuzhou steamboat to chase after them, but there was no trace of the bandits. After the Wuhing County Government received the news, Huang, the concurrent county magistrate, took the Huanhuzhou patrol ship to the scene yesterday afternoon to inspect it personally and found that Zhang Hecheng's brother, Zhang Zhongnan, was suspected. He was taken to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Requesting Relief for Damage to Water Conservancy</p>
<p>The Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is currently under construction, passing through a section within Shaoxing County. For the sake of reducing the construction cost, it has blocked the Grand Canal, bypassed small rivers, and filled in the original river courses and crooked harbors at bridges along the road. As a result, the county's water flow cannot be properly discharged, and future flooding is likely to cause blockage and inundation, easily becoming a major disaster. Various legal organizations such as the County Chamber of Commerce and the Farmers' Association held a joint meeting on the afternoon of the 15th to discuss relief measures. It was decided that each legal organization would present a detailed account of the railway bridge construction plan's damage to agricultural water conservancy and request the county to forward a telegram to the provincial authorities for relief. They also first notified the engineering department to temporarily suspend construction and telegraphed the provincial government and the Ministry of Railways directly, requesting that the straight river channels not be curved and blocked, obstructing the water flow, and that the width of the bridges must be widened in accordance with the standards of the highway bridges along the line.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>The Entire Wenchang Pavilion is Burned Down</p>
<p>The Wenchang Pavilion in Xiaoshan Wenyan Xiabu was built by Huang Sixin, a local worthy of the Qing Dynasty, and has now been 56 years old. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM on the 12th of this month, a fire suddenly broke out in the side house on the west side of the hall. It was not extinguished until 12:00 noon. The entire Wenchang Pavilion was almost completely burned down. The old woman managing the temple, who was seventy years old, was also buried in the fire.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Liu Hanzhang Returns to Fujian for Inspection</p>
<p>Liu Hanzhang, courtesy name Zhongzuan, a native of Minhou, was dispatched by the Ministry to Fujian to inspect judicial affairs. He is a senior figure in the judicial world and has long served as the Presiding Judge of the Supreme Court. This time, he was dispatched to return to Fujian and has been inspecting various judicial organs in Fujian Province under the guidance of Tong Hangshi, the President of the Higher Court, for the past few days. According to him, this is the second time he has returned to Fujian to inspect judicial affairs. He also returned once when Zheng Xiaoyun was the President of the Higher Court. At that time, due to the shortage of judicial funds, the agencies and prisons were simple and crude. This time, when he came again, they had been completely renovated. The handling of cases in the civil and criminal courts and the procuratorate was also very vigorous. All the arrangements within the court were also very orderly, which shows President Tong's clear rule of law and construction efforts.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the news "Opium Addict Investigation Bribery Case" in your newspaper's Kunshan correspondence on February 14th, which stated that after opium addict Gao Zhongliang was reported by someone, he was sent to the county hospital for investigation, and in a state of fear and panic, he entrusted Yuan Kegong to secretly negotiate bribery with Xue A'gen, the hospital's rickshaw driver, this is inconsistent with the facts. The truth is, my father, Gao Zhongliang, entered Kunshan Hospital for investigation on February 21st. On February 6th, the hospital director, Chen Quanheng, instructed Yuan Kegong, an opium addict undergoing investigation in the hospital, to contact Guo Shi, saying that if he was willing to pay money, he would be given a certificate stating "no poison, no addiction" and be released early. Otherwise, he would be deemed to have poison and addiction. Guo Shi immediately gave him one hundred yuan. However, two days after paying the money, my father was still not released from the hospital. When Guo Shi questioned Yuan, he said that he had contacted Xue A'gen, the hospital director's rickshaw driver, and that another one hundred and fifty yuan was needed to release him. Guo Shi had no way to raise the money and was extremely anxious. When the matter was reported to my uncle, Gao Bangying, and uncle-in-law, Zhou Tiandu, they were shocked and said that Guo Shi was young and ignorant and was being defrauded. They planned to expose the inside story so that they could report it. Therefore, they decided to turn the tables on the fraudsters. When Yuan Kegong came to the house for the second time to negotiate, they feigned hospitality and readily agreed, but pretended to say that they did not have the money on hand and needed to go to the city to raise it. The next day (10th), they lured Yuan Kegong and others to the city and had tea at Ban Yuan Garden. Then, they summoned Chen Renheng's rickshaw driver, Xue A'gen, to pass on a message. At the same time, they secretly reported to the county police station, which sent medical officers to the scene and arrested Yuan. Xue escaped, but was later arrested as well. The police station recorded their confessions and sent them to the judiciary for handling. They were immediately detained in court for investigation. This is the general situation of the case. I am writing to inform you of the facts and hope that your newspaper will disclose this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to verify the truth. I am deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chinese Football Team Lost to Hong Kong All-Stars Yesterday</h3>
<p>The result was six to zero. The Shanghai team is going to Guangzhou today.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 17th: The Shanghai Chinese Interport Football Team played an exhibition match against the Hong Kong All-Stars team at Caroline Hill Stadium at 4 pm on the 17th. Because Li Ning and others were injured and did not play, the team's lineup was scattered. In the first half, they were repeatedly scored on by Siao Kwok-shan's and Noel. The situation was one-sided. In the second half, after Hu Li scored a goal for the Hong Kong team, goalkeeper Luo Lan Shi even took a penalty kick and scored another goal. As a result, the Shanghai team suffered a crushing defeat of zero to six. The team is scheduled to go to the province on the 18th for exhibition matches.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Hong Kong) The first Shanghai-Hong Kong Chinese Interport Football Match was held at Caroline Hill Stadium at 3:30 pm on the 14th. The fans watching the game were extremely crowded, with an estimated number of more than 8,000 people. The situation was extremely lively. The weather was severely cold that day, with biting cold winds. The fans watching the game showed no signs of shrinking back. The battle was dull and lacked exciting performances. Because Chen Zhenhe, Sun Jinshun, and Li Yishen and others were unable to spare the time to come, the strength of the Shanghai team was extremely weak and could not withstand a single blow, resulting in a disastrous defeat to the Hong Kong team with a score of one to five. The Shanghai team's performance was abnormal that day. Judging from its strength, it was not as good as the Hong Kong ordinary Second Division's ever-victorious Navy team. The record of the battle is as follows:</p>
<p>Battle process</p>
<p>When Ye Jiugao entered the field to officiate, the Hong Kong team launched an attack, but because it was too polite, it did not open the scoring for a long time. Huang Meishun, seeing that it was not good, repeatedly fired cold arrows to threaten the Shanghai team. Before long, Li Huitang took advantage of Zhang Manrong's pass, settled the ball twenty yards away, and scored the first goal with a shot. Unexpectedly, after the Hong Kong team won, it did not advance further. Zhuo Shijin was also injured and left the field and was replaced by Yang Shuiyi. Coming and going, it was taken advantage of by the Shanghai team. Xu Jingcheng saw an opportunity and used high-angle artillery to transport the ball forward. Tan Jiangbai originally intended to jump high to save the ball, but Bao Jiaping was overly flustered and came out to snatch the ball, and could not turn around in time. He was penetrated by Nan Douwen with a goal, making it one to one. Afterwards, Zhang Manrong and Yang Shuiyi each made a contribution, and the Hong Kong team took the lead with three to one.</p>
<p>After the break, the second half continued. Zhang Rongcai showed his skills, blocking Li Zhaorong's cross-shot. Then, with a pigeon somersault, he blocked the ball shot by Yang Shuiyi, which was well received. Unexpectedly, Li Huitang broke through the barrier and went straight in, passing through layers of defense. Zhang Rongcai came out to rescue. Li then performed his life's best technique, lifting the ball over Zhang Rongcai. Dai Lin couldn't help but lie down and launch a massive counterattack, but it was blocked by Tan Jiangbai and ultimately failed to be effective. Then, Liu Shizhan fouled in the penalty area. Huang Meishun took a penalty kick, and the ball hit Zhang Rongcai and bounced out. Meishun then moved forward to shoot again and scored. At that time, Li Ning and Xu Jingcheng were injured and left the field one after another, and Jiang Shaoxiang and Wang Kehou replaced them, but they gained nothing. The Hong Kong team then won this championship with five to one.</p>
<p>Banquet situation</p>
<p>At 8 pm that night, the Hong Kong Chinese Sports Association held a conference at Guangzhou Restaurant. In addition to the chairman of the host association, Cai Huihong, the vice-chairman, Xie Yuchuan, the former chairman, Quan Chengkun, and the members of the association, as well as the main guest, Jiang Xiangqing, the representative of the National Association, and all the team members, there were more than 100 people, including Mr. Wenna, the chairman of the Hong Kong Football Association, the chairman of Tung Wah Hospital, the chief director of Po Leung Kuk, and people from all walks of life.

<h3>Shanghai Basketball Association Group A Group Jia Team Xin Wins the Championship</h3>
<p>Defeated Mai Ling Jia 39 to 34 yesterday. Mai Ling Yi won the Group A Group Yi championship.</p>
<p>Team Xin defeated Mai Ling Jia 39 to 34 yesterday, completing the Shanghai Basketball Association's Group Jia schedule with a record of five wins and zero losses, and winning the championship. Yesterday's game was light and interesting. Team Xin's victory was mainly due to Nanbu Yao Ya serving as center. Mai Ling was too careful, and Locke and Brizi were closely monitored, causing the entire team to lose its center of gravity and have fewer scoring opportunities. Technically, Team Xin was indeed above Mai Ling yesterday. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Basketball Association restored the participation of the two strong teams, Fudan and Jinan, Team Xin recruited important members from the two teams, and had long been determined to win the championship. In addition, Xintong gave up the concept of the championship and acted perfunctorily, so Mai Ling and Team Xin became confrontational. In the end, Team Xin was able to consolidate its position and win the throne with its lively performance.</p>
<p>Currently, there is still one game left in the Group A schedule, Mai Ling vs. Wu Long, to determine the runner-up. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>The Mai Ling vs. Xin game started at 8 pm. There were about 300 Chinese spectators. After Ziwendayun opened the scoring, Mai Ling showed considerable activity, and Apaidajia scored repeatedly. Within five minutes, they took the lead with 7 to 4. Feng Nianhua threw two shots and took the lead with 8 to 7. Kang Deng also returned two balls, making it 11 to 8, causing Team Xin to temporarily regress. Goda Yun regained the advantage (12 to 11). In an instant, they lost three points again. In the midst of desperate struggles, it became 14 to 14. After Feng Nianhua scored a free throw on the 16th, Team Xin took the lead from then on. The first half ended with a score of 23 to 18.</p>
<p>In the renewed battle, Mai Ling showed considerable revitalization, but the dead-like appearance of the guards after getting the ball and the slow pace forward reduced the enthusiasm of the game. Furthermore, the defense under the basket was strict. It was difficult for Team Xin to attack. Team Xin's advance and retreat was rapid, and the charge under the basket was also very moving. A discerning person could already speculate on the final outcome. Therefore, although Mai Ling showed temporary ability, it had few scoring opportunities. Except for once when the score became close at 29 to 27, Team Xin often led by five or six points. When Zhou Weiyun, who scored the most points for Team Xin on the 28th and 33rd, was ejected due to four fouls, Mai Ling was ultimately unable to stir up waves and reverse the situation, and ultimately lost by five points with a score of 34 to 29.</p>
<p>Team Mai Ling Yi defeated Team Ying 48 to 24 yesterday. The first half ended with a score of 31 to 8. The team completed the Group A Group Yi championship with a record of six wins and zero losses.</p>

<h3>World Education Conference Held in Japan</h3>
<p>Countries not recognized by the League of Nations are participating.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th) It is rumored that the World Education Conference, which will be held in Japan in August of this year, will have countries not recognized by the League of Nations participating. In case this becomes a reality, the Chinese Education Society has pre-prepared questions to solicit opinions from its members on how to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Publisher's Talk on Textbook Pricing</h3>
<p>Books are ineffective and equal to waste paper, and paper prices are soaring. The cost cannot be calculated with pure labor and materials.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) A reporter visited an important employee of a bookstore about the issue of textbook pricing. According to him, since the Qing Dynasty promoted new-style education, textbooks have been compiled and printed by bookstores. Last year, the Ministry of Education summoned four companies, Commercial Press, Chung Hwa, World, and Zheng Zhong, to the Ministry to discuss printing textbooks compiled by the Ministry. Since the government has decided to compile its own books, from an educational standpoint, each company should do its best to assist. Therefore, they resolutely signed a contract with the Ministry of Education to print the books and were willing to assume 100,000 yuan per year to assist in editing costs in order to complete the Ministry's compilation of textbooks as soon as possible. After signing the contract, they did their best to rush the printing of the books compiled by the Ministry and fully prepared enough stock for schools in various places to adopt. Because the textbooks for each subject have not yet been compiled into a complete set, it is difficult to sell all the stocks at once. Each company has put aside a lot of capital. If it is said that they are profiting from this, it is simply not true. As for the outside world saying that textbook prices are too high, it is important to know that the cost of any business cannot be calculated with pure labor and materials. Moreover, other industries can turn their inventory into treasures when it is unavoidable, but books are ineffective or out of date, which is equal to waste paper. Although textbooks have very large sales when they are first compiled, they must be revised at most every three years. Whenever they are revised, old textbooks must be cut and destroyed due to their obsolescence. When the new curriculum standards for the Republic of China were promulgated in 1933, each Shanghai publisher destroyed more than 80 million elementary school textbooks. If the initial pricing does not include this loss, then the publishing companies will inevitably go bankrupt when the Ministry compiles and revises the textbooks after three years. Furthermore, paper prices have recently soared, and newspaper prices have almost doubled, but the book industry has not increased book prices slightly for fear of increasing the burden on the reading community and affecting education. The criticism from the outside world is due to a great lack of knowledge of the situation in the book industry.</p>

<h3>Overview of Shanghai Experimental Primary School (1)</h3>
<p>— Special Report by Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>There are two Shanghai Experimental Primary Schools: one established by the Jiangsu Provincial Government Department of Education, named Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Experimental Primary School; the other established by the Shanghai Municipal Government Social Bureau, named Shanghai Municipal Experimental Primary School. This article describes the general situation of the various facilities of the Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Experimental Primary School. The general situation of the Municipal Experimental Primary School will be introduced in another article. The author is grateful to Mr. Sheng Langxi, the principal of Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Experimental Primary School, for providing various materials and for giving me a summary of the school's overview. I would like to express my thanks here.</p>
<p>1. School History</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Experimental Primary School was founded in the 癸卯 year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (i.e., eight years before the founding of the Republic of China), and has a history of thirty-four years. At that time, Shanghai County gentry Ji Huike, Yao Wengou and others raised funds to open a primary school in the Minzong and Liugong ancestral halls in the Twenty-Two Shop area of Shanghai County, named Twenty-Two Shop Primary School. Mr. Mai Jiying and Mr. Yang Yueru served as directors. On the first day of school, only twenty-seven students attended.</p>
<p>Two years later, the Jiangsu Songtai Dao opened the Longmen Normal School, and the Twenty-Two Shop Primary School was changed to an attached primary school, named Longmen Normal School Affiliated Primary School. In March of the first year of the Republic of China, the Longmen Normal School was renamed Jiangsu Provincial Second Normal School, and the school was also renamed Jiangsu Provincial Second Normal School Affiliated Primary School. At this time, Mr. Mai Jiying served as the principal, and Mr. Yang Pingyu served as the director.</p>
<p>In May of the third year of the Republic of China, the school built a new school building at the old site of the Prefectural Office in Shangwen Gate, and the entire school was divided into two parts: the new school building in Shangwen Gate was the first part; the old school building of Minzhong and Liugong ancestral halls in Ximen was the first part. In August of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Provincial Second Normal School merged with the Shanghai Commercial College and other schools to reorganize into the National Fourth Sun Yat-sen University Shanghai Middle School, and the school was renamed the National Fourth Sun Yat-sen University Shanghai Middle School Experimental Primary School, with Mr. Sheng Langxi as the principal. Later, the school changed its name several times, and in July of the twenty-third year, it was renamed Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Experimental Primary School. At the same time, the school built a new school building in Wujia Lane and added a third part.</p>

<h3>British Representative Mr. Beatley Emphasizes That Sino-British Cooperation Is Absolutely Necessary</h3>
<p>With the vast populations and lands of both countries, they can influence the happiness of the world's humanity.</p>
<p>Mr. Beatley, the special representative of the British Export Credit Guarantee Bureau in China, gave a speech at the banquet of the Sino-British Alumni Association the day before yesterday, strongly advocating that China and Britain must cooperate effectively. The following is a translation of the main points of his speech.</p>
<p>"I am honored to be invited by the chairman of your association to participate. I believe that you do not want me to give any formal speech, but I hope that you will allow me to talk casually. Yesterday, I received a notice from your association and recalled that a century ago, Sir Parkes, the first British Minister to China, said at a gathering of the same nature, 'I believe that the true friendship between the two countries is based on the love of the people of the two countries and is obtained through communication and cooperation. The realization of this will not be far away.' The main purpose of your association is to maintain the interest of you in the education you received in the UK. By the UK, I mean Scotland and Wales, not the entire British Empire. You have studied or practiced in schools in England and Scotland. I believe that you can understand the lives and thoughts of the people of our country, and what is especially noteworthy is that you can sympathize with our country's intentions towards friendly countries. I believe that our expatriates must also be able to contribute a lot to the motherland, that is, they can guide and help us understand the lives, thoughts, and political situation of the people of their country. If they do not have a good impression of the people of the country where they are located, then we will not be able to gain anything from it. Now, I sincerely hope that the people of our country who live in China, if they return home, will be able to give the people of our country a correct understanding of the Chinese people. Similarly, I also hope that the Chinese who have studied in the UK will work hard to promote the understanding between China and Britain, so that the people of your country will know what you have learned in the UK, promote the friendship between the two countries, and increase the interests of the two countries. I also hope that those of you who have studied in the UK, as well as the people of enemy countries who live in China, will criticize and study the living conditions of the people of both countries at any time. It is necessary to know that well-intentioned criticism is very necessary, so I now suggest that your association organize various debate meetings so that you can freely discuss various issues, such as a certain action, special thoughts, and temporary unusual trends. When it is necessary to expose, test, and explain, I believe that this kind of friendly debate can eliminate various misunderstandings and obtain a correct understanding. Otherwise, true harmony and sincere understanding will not be possible. I have traveled to many countries and have this confidence. I dare to embrace this goal and make friends with people from all walks of life in your country. Now I am exploring the differences and similarities between the thoughts, customs, habits, forms, hobbies, family life, moral concepts, and social order of the people of the two countries, but it is easier to explore the similarities than to observe the differences. It is expected that the similarities must be more than the differences. These are all things that we must tolerate, understand, and sympathize with. If we see them in our thoughts and actions, then the love of the two countries and their people can be expressed. China has almost one-quarter of the world's population, and Britain has almost one-quarter of the world's land. These two major countries almost represent 45 percent of the world's 200,000 population. If a world conference is convened and elections are held, and this kind of election can control the world, then China and Britain must be able to gain an advantage due to their large populations and land. Although there is no such fact now, the cooperation on these two major political units must be of great importance to world peace and human happiness. We can be proud of the history and culture of the two countries, but in the past, we have all sought individual development. However, today, we must work together to seek happiness for all mankind. To achieve this goal, the only way is to establish and promote true friendship. My mission in coming to China this time is to enable our country's goods to be exported to your country by credit methods. I hope that all the imported goods will be of good quality. I also hope that every invoice and every bill of lading will be accurate and error-free. I also hope that the friendship between the two countries will increase with trade. I can only reiterate what Sir Parkes said to the Shanghai business community on September 6, 1883. What I am most pleased about is to support China's development and to enable close contacts between the people of the two countries. I now sincerely agree with this statement and hope that the British living in China will understand this and engage in close cooperation to seek mutual understanding. I think it is also the urgent hope of both China and Britain."</p>

<h3>Good Situation of Chinese Sugar Industry Last Year</h3>
<p>Annual Sales Reached More Than 340,000 Bags, Although Smuggling in North China Was Rampant, Fortunately It Did Not Affect</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, smuggling was rampant in North China last year, and smuggled sugar was rampant, but the Chinese sugar operators who were operating properly in the city all reported profits at the end of the year. According to statistics, the sales volume of domestically produced machine-made sugar in one year has reached 3,428,360 bags. The reporter specially investigated the situation of the sugar industry in the city as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Stock Company Sets Prices for Package Sales</p>
<p>For a long time, our country has been a huge importer of foreign sugar, accounting for the second position in the trade deficit. The ups and downs of the sugar market have always been controlled by foreign merchants in Hong Kong. After Shanghai Chinese merchants directly purchased from various producing areas, the sugar market moved from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The Yuegui Sugar Factory was established the year before last. Xinghua Bank, a major sugar merchant in the city, gathered sugar merchants from all over the city and organized a joint stock company to set prices for package sales. If there were any unsold products, Xinghua Bank would sweep them all for package sales. Shanghai has become the center for promoting the sales of domestic sugar. If there is a shortage, foreign sugar will be purchased.</p>
<p>Well-Organized Sugar Market Stable</p>
<p>Sugar is a daily necessity, and it is very important to the people's livelihood. The sugar merchants in the city are unwilling to kill each other and unite in a common spirit. The joint stock company last spring and summer, the price of sugar fell daily, and the domestic sugar stored in Shanghai reached 200,000 bags, worth several million yuan. Although the consumption was lost day by day, it was decided not to reduce the price for promotion in order to stabilize the sugar market. This is entirely due to the well-organized organization, which can avoid foreign manipulation.</p>
<p>Sales are Brisk in Tianjin, Hankou and Other Places</p>
<p>Sugar is sold a lot in Tianjin, Hankou, Suzhou and Hangzhou. Chaozhou, Shantou, Minyue are the areas where sugar is produced. The reason why the national sugar market regards Shanghai as a transfer is that it knows the world market situation and knows the situation of sugar merchants in various ports. It delivers goods first and sets a date for payment. This is something that Taikoo and Dutch sugar merchants dare not do. Chinese merchants are more determined to purchase foreign sugar only when domestic sugar sales are not good. Therefore, domestic sugar sales are bound to be brisk.</p>
<p>Excellent Production, Promising Future</p>
<p>At present, the products of the Yuegui Dongguan Shunde Market Head Three Factories in our country are comparable to imported products. However, the machines of the Huiyang, Jieyang, Xinzhao and Guixian factories are slightly inferior due to machine relations. If they are improved, the future of domestic sugar is unlimited. Smuggling in North China last year did not affect domestic sugar, which was purely due to the fact that the joint stock company and sugar merchants were able to promote domestic products and did not compete for private interests.</p>
<h3>China Aviation Ordered a Giant Aircraft That Will Arrive at the End of the Month</h3>

It is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month. There is a rumor that one aircraft has arrived. The company stated that it was not true. As for the remaining aircraft, they will also be shipped to China one after another.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Yumin Bank to be Reorganized into Provincial Bank</h3>
<p>Increase in Government Shares by One Million - Expected to be Realized Soon</p>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, Xiong Shihui, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, in order to alleviate the financial drought and revitalize industry, intends to reorganize the Jiangxi Yumin Bank into the Jiangxi Provincial Bank, increasing government shares by one million yuan to make it the only local bank in Jiangxi province. Agreement has been obtained from the majority of shareholders, and it is expected to be realized soon. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>History of Yumin Bank</p>
<p>In 1926, when the Revolutionary Army recaptured Nanchang, the Jiangxi Yumin Bank, which had been organized during the warlord era, was declared bankrupt. In 1927, Huang Shi, the Director of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Finance, prepared to restore it, with the provincial government and the original creditors each contributing 500,000 yuan, totaling one million yuan. This joint government-business Jiangxi Yumin Bank was officially established in January 1928. By 1932, in order to fulfill the mission of a local bank, it was decided to expand the business area, invest in construction projects, and facilitate the transportation and sale of products as the business policy. Significant progress has been made to date. The head office is located in Nanchang, with branches in Jiujiang, Ji'an, Fuzhou, Hekou, and Raozhou. There are 24 offices in Shanghai, Wucheng, Wuning, etc. The business is still quite developed.</p>
<p>Reasons for Reorganization</p>
<p>Chairman Xiong of Jiangxi Province, in view of the past, due to the impact of banditry and natural disasters in Jiangxi, society was devastated, and all industries were depressed, with the prices of various production items plummeting. In order to revive the industry and prosper society, it is planned to strengthen the organization of the Jiangxi Yumin Bank, so as to invigorate finance and assist all industries. Therefore, a plan was specifically drafted to reorganize the Yumin Bank into the Jiangxi Provincial Bank, expanding government shares to 1.5 million yuan. In addition to the original 500,000 yuan, an additional one million yuan will be added, combined with 500,000 yuan in commercial shares, totaling two million yuan, in order to increase its strength. The draft articles of association have been circulated to solicit the opinions of the various shareholders. According to the Xinxin News Agency reporter, the directors and shareholders of the bank have all expressed their approval of the provincial government's move. Therefore, a shareholders' meeting will be convened soon to formally realize it.</p>
<h3>Song Ziliang's Illness Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>Can Return South to Resume Duties in Two More Weeks</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Song Ziliang, Director of the Finance Department of the Guangdong Provincial Government, has been in Shanghai for more than a month for medical treatment. According to Song's aides, Song suffers from rheumatism, which recurs every spring and summer in Guangdong due to the humid climate. Coupled with his busy official duties, his old illness relapsed. He came to Shanghai and was admitted to the Ansi Hospital for treatment. He is now gradually recovering and will be able to return south to resume his duties in two more weeks of rest.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Agrees to Refer to Amendments to the Income Tax Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously convened representatives from chambers of commerce along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou and Ningbo lines, as well as representatives from various trade associations in Shanghai, to hold a research meeting on income tax and resolved several proposals. After the meeting, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sorted them out separately. Regarding the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, they were submitted to the Legislative and Executive Yuan, requesting that they be adopted and amended. A reply was received from the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan stating, "To the esteemed, we have received a document from the President regarding the meeting convened by the chambers of commerce along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line and various trade associations in the city, regarding the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, requesting additions, deletions, and amendments to various points. The petition was approved and referred to the Finance Committee for reference." The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has notified the various chambers of commerce accordingly.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Improve Bookkeeping After Implementation of Income Tax</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Opens Classes in the South City to Teach</p>
<p>After the implementation of the income tax, the bookkeeping and accounting records of various industries in this city have become very important. They have been actively discussing improvements. Currently, the Soybean and Rice Industry, the Sauce and Pickles Industry, and the Silk and Satin Industry have all established special committees to collect the books and records used by the various member stores, compare and study them one by one, standardize the names, prescribe the formats, and distribute them to the various members for application, starting from this year, so as to avoid any troubles when inspecting the books in the future. The various trade associations in the South City requested the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to open classes to teach improved Chinese-style bookkeeping. In the past, the classes were held in the North City and in the evening, making it inconvenient to travel to and from, and many were unable to participate. Therefore, they specifically requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to open a special class in the South City to meet the demand. It is heard that the Chamber of Commerce has decided to open a class in improved Chinese-style bookkeeping and a class in income tax research at the Shangji Vocational School on Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen. The bookkeeping class will be held every Tuesday and Thursday, and the income tax class will be held every Saturday and Sunday. Classes will be held from 7 PM to 9 PM. The tuition fee for the bookkeeping class is six yuan, and the tuition fee for the income tax class is four yuan, including handouts. The Xu Yongzuo Accounting Firm is still invited to lecture. The starting date is set for March 1st. Registration and payment will be accepted at the Shangji Vocational School from today.</p>
<h3>He Shangping Discusses the Sericulture Industry in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Early Spring and Late Autumn are Best for Raising Silkworms; Outlines Improvement Steps</p>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, He Shangping, Director of the Sericulture Improvement Committee of the National Economic Council, was invited by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction and the Guangzhou Municipal Government to inspect the sericulture situation in Guangdong. He has completed his task and returned to Shanghai. A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency paid him a special visit to inquire about the inspection process and future improvement plans. According to him, regarding how to improve the sericulture industry in Guangdong Province, since returning from the inspection, he has begun to draft a plan for improvement, detailing the improvement steps. The plan is still being sorted out and will be released to the public after being reviewed by Guangzhou Mayor Zeng Yangfu and Guangdong Construction Director Liu Weichi. As for his impressions of the trip to Guangdong, they are good, but the improvement of sericulture is a scientific matter and cannot be encompassed by a single "good" word. Analytically speaking, the silkworm rearing areas in Guangdong Province are concentrated in Shunde and Lianglong. Although there is production in Hainan, it is very small, so we only went to the two places to inspect. In the past, when the silk production in Guangdong was at its peak, it reached 30,000 piculs, almost half of the silk production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Considering the proportion of the area of the production area, the production volume was shocking. However, because they did not pay attention to the improvement of technology, it gradually decreased. Last year's production was less than 10,000 piculs. The rapid decline is deeply regrettable. Guangdong Province has a warm climate, which is very suitable for silkworm rearing. The best seasons of the year are the big season (Cantonese), which is now in early spring, and the sixth and seventh seasons, which are in late autumn in October and November. At other times, the temperature is either too high or it is rainy and stuffy. Therefore, early spring and late autumn are the most suitable seasons for silkworm rearing in Guangdong Province. However, the development of mulberry leaves is very good due to the climate. One mu of mulberry land can produce as much as 27 or 28 piculs of mulberry leaves per year, and it does not require cultivation. Compared to the well-cultivated mulberry land in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which produces a maximum of 6 or 7 piculs per mu per year, the proportion is vastly different.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Sends Kong Xuexiong to Investigate the Shanghai Fish Market</h3>
<p>According to the Shenzhou News Agency, Zhu Jiasheng, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, specially sent Kong Xuexiong, a member of the Fisheries Management Committee, to Shanghai to investigate the production and sales situation of the fish market in order to provide a reference for the development of the fishery industry in Zhejiang Province. The fish market, because 80% of the fish come from Ningbo, Wenzhou, Taizhou and other counties in Zhejiang Province, the Shanghai fish market is most related to the Zhejiang fish dishes and the lives of the fishermen. After arriving in Shanghai, Kong went to the fish market yesterday afternoon, where he was received and visited by Secretary Ren Jinpin, and then studied and investigated. He is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for three days before returning to Hangzhou.</p>
<p>The Lives of Fishermen are Extremely Difficult</p>
<p>According to Kong, Zhejiang Province is rich in fishery products, most of which are concentrated in Ningbo, Wenzhou, Taizhou and other areas, with about 20 counties on the sea. There are about 2 million fishermen in the province. As for the production of fish, there are no statistics, but it is roughly estimated that there are 5 million yuan of freshwater fish and about 20 million yuan of marine fish. The lives of fishermen are extremely difficult, even worse than that of farmers. The biggest reasons are that 1) the price of fish is low, 2) the sea is unsafe, and 3) there is no guarantee of catching fish. As a result, fishermen have developed special personalities, such as not being able to catch fish for several days, and then spending money casually as soon as they make a lot of money, without knowing how to save. Therefore, it is very important to improve the organization of the fishery industry and improve the education of fishermen.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province's Measures to Reorganize the Fishery Industry</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Province's measures to reorganize the fishery industry are as follows: 1) A fishery loan of 2 million yuan has been established, which is jointly loaned by the Zhejiang Local Bank and the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, of which one million yuan is used for business loans, such as various construction costs in the fishery industry, and another million yuan is used for fisherman loans to help them maintain their livelihoods. 2) Actively protecting fishing, as pirates appear on the sea, which affects the activities of fishermen. Protecting their safety is essential. 3) Technical and sales aspects are being planned. 4) Fishery salt is an important product for the fishery industry, and there may be control measures in the future. 5) Strengthening and reorganizing fishermen's organizations. In the past, there were only fishery guilds, etc., and there were very few cooperatives and fishery associations. 6) Improving the education level of fishermen to improve technology and increase production. 7) Reorganizing the water patrol system. 8) Conducting fishery vessel registration and fishery statistics so that the entire province's fishery industry can be checked.</p>
<h3>Workers at Hengfeng Silk Weaving Factory Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Scheduled to Mediate on the 20th</p>
<p>More than 300 workers at the Hengfeng Silk Weaving Factory on Haizhou Road went on strike to demand improved treatment. After persuasion from the Social Affairs Bureau, the workers resumed work yesterday. It is reported that the Bureau has scheduled to convene both labor and management at 9 AM on the 20th to mediate.</p>
<h3>Factory at New Yu No. 2 Factory Went on Strike Again Yesterday After Resuming Work</h3>
<p>Party and Government Agencies to Investigate Today</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, all the workers at the New Yu Textile Company No. 2 Factory on Route Robison in Western Shanghai went on strike some time ago to demand improved treatment and made six demands to the factory. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, they resumed work yesterday. The workers in the fine spinning department of the company's No. 1 Factory at 37 Suzhou Road also demanded that the factory pay them double wages for the New Year and provide rest time. When their demands were not met, they went on strike at 1 PM. The workers in other departments continued to work as usual and were not affected. The factory immediately released all the workers in that department. At about 6 PM, when the night shift came on, some of the workers also joined the strike and refused to enter the factory. It is reported that party and government agencies will send people to investigate the truth today in order to mediate and prevent the labor unrest from expanding.</p>
<h3>No Solution Yet to the Layoff Dispute at the Public Welfare Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>Factory to Issue Severance Pay Tomorrow</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, after the Public Welfare Yarn Factory at 150 Route Robison in Western Shanghai announced the dismissal of more than 300 workers in the bobbin room, etc., the labor side insisted on paying six months' severance pay, but the capital side only agreed to one month. Due to the wide difference in opinion, a labor unrest occurred and has not been resolved. It is now reported that the factory has announced that it will distribute severance pay to the laid-off workers at 2 PM on the afternoon of the 19th. The workers will decide what to do next based on the amount of severance pay they receive.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Eagerly Hope Government Will Not Allow Tax Exemption for Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Last year, there were bumper harvests in agricultural areas across the country, and the rural economy was active. As domestic rice supply exceeded demand, rice prices steadily declined. Since the Lunar New Year, market prices have remained flat and sluggish. A reporter from the Dagong News Agency interviewed rice merchant Zhu Zixiang to understand the situation of grain merchants and rice prices. Mr. Zhu told the reporter that the business of grain merchants across the country improved last year, farmers' incomes were quite substantial, and all industries and transportation reported surpluses. This is sufficient to prove that the rural economy has recovered slightly. The main point is that our country is based on agriculture. The prosperity or decline of the countryside is related to the lifeline of the national economy. Therefore, government officials spare no effort in the work of revitalizing the countryside. Countries around the world also attach great importance to the countryside. However, the rice prices in this port are because Guangdong Province is requesting tax exemption for foreign rice again. If the government approves it, the rice price will plummet, which is expected. As a result, rice sales areas are all waiting and watching. Those who have suffered from the dumping of foreign rice in previous years still feel the pain when they think about it. Upon hearing the news of foreign rice tax exemption, they all carefully consider and delay importing, resulting in very sluggish sales and a drop in rice prices. However, it is difficult for the public to understand why Guangdong Province insists on requesting tax exemption for foreign rice. If the province is really short of rice, why not purchase it from the surplus rice provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui in our country? As for the rice price in Guangdong Province, it is not very high. The reported price of 17 or 18 yuan per picul is the silver dollar price. Because 1,500 Guangdong dollars are exchanged for 1,000 Hong Kong dollars, 10 yuan is already equivalent to 15 yuan. A rice price of 18 yuan per picul is only 12 yuan in national currency, which is not much different from the rice price in Shanghai. However, the claim that one yuan can buy six sheng of rice is unknown what kind of weight scale is used in that province. According to the highest-priced rice in Shanghai, plus all the expenses, and water transport to the province, one yuan can buy one jin. Moreover, the rice transported by Guangdong merchants in Shanghai still needs to make a profit. It is difficult to guess what the truth is. What is most worrying is that the countryside is recovering. If it is dumped by foreign rice again, not only will the financial outflow, but also the rural areas that were celebrating will be feared to go bankrupt. The collapse of the economy is a hidden worry. I think the government authorities will plan and will not easily approve it.</p>
<h3>Demand for Socks in the Three Northeastern Provinces Exceeds Supply</h3>
<p>Shanghai Goods Gradually Selling Well</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, the sock sales in the markets of the three northeastern provinces were originally a major sales market for the Shanghai knitting industry. After the September 18th Incident, because the environment of the factories was no longer the same as before, and the puppet state levied exorbitant taxes, making it difficult to transport there at cost, they had no choice but to give up the market with heartache. Recently, due to the immaturity of the knitting industry in that area, although some small factories from Shanghai have moved there to produce, the output does not meet the demand. Moreover, due to technical and other expenses, the cost is higher. Therefore, customers in that area have come south to purchase. Although the puppet state's taxes have not been reduced, it is heard that the tax on ordinary thread socks is about 4 jiao per dozen in national currency. However, transportation and sales are unobstructed. Recently, there have been small transactions with customers in Shenyang and other places. In order to promote sales, the customer factories are selling at the lowest original cost, hoping to gradually develop.</p>
<h3>Qianzhuang Abolishes Check Notification Procedures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Qianye Guild has informed various qianzhuang and their customers that the usual practice of requiring customers to notify the qianzhuang after issuing a check for 500 or 1,000 yuan before the payment can be made (i.e., the stub) is in conflict with Article 31, Section 5 of the current Negotiable Instruments Law. The industry colleagues have convened a meeting and resolved to abolish the notification procedure for all customers who use checks from the various qianzhuang in the industry after the end of the 25th year and the start of operations. To support the check, once the issuer issues the check, he is legally responsible for the full payment. A notice has been published in the newspaper yesterday to inform all check users to pay close attention when issuing checks.</p>
<h3>National Goods Industry Federation Prepares to Go to Hebei for Exhibition</h3>
<p>Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting to be Held on the 20th to Discuss the Progress of Association Affairs</p>
<p>The National Goods Industry Federation of this city received a letter from the Jiaxing County National Goods Promotion Association requesting to hold a national goods exhibition to promote national goods. The original letter stated, "To the esteemed, we have received a public letter No. 29 from the Jiaxing County New Life Movement Promotion Association, which states that foreign goods are flooding our country, the leakage of wealth is increasing day by day, the economic panic is increasing, and unemployment is increasing sharply. The reason for this is that, on the one hand, the national goods in the past have not been improved, and cannot compete with foreign goods side by side. On the other hand, the people are ignorant of the national conditions because of the beauty of foreign goods, and they compete to purchase them. Although there are those who use national goods for their business, they are deceived by unscrupulous merchants because they cannot identify them and are deceived by unscrupulous merchants who use foreign goods to impersonate national goods. Therefore, many people are mistakenly purchased. What is a national good and what is a foreign good must be made clear to the people so that the promotion of national loans can be effective. Therefore, at the seventh board of directors meeting, it was resolved that 1) the United Federation of Shanghai and Hangzhou National Goods Factories will be contacted to hold a national goods exhibition in Jiaxing in the shortest possible time. 2) Institutions and groups that employ public goods personnel should conduct regular lectures so that they can uniformly recognize and speak about national goods. The records of the two cases are recorded in the file. Correspondingly, the file is recorded and sent to you for approval." In view of this, promoting national goods is an urgent task for saving the country. A national goods exhibition will give the people a deep understanding, so as to arouse the people to compete for purchase by understanding. It is an urgent plan. We have always admired your association's enthusiasm for promotion and sparing no effort. This is probably a consensus. In response to the previous letter, we will send personnel to Jiaxing in the shortest possible time to hold a national goods exhibition to promote and benefit national goods. We hope to see a reply. After receiving the letter, the association decided to hold a joint executive and supervisory committee meeting at the Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road at 12 noon on the 20th of this month to discuss everything and the progress of the association's affairs.</p>

<h3>Police Bureau Orders All Smoking Cessation Centers to Promote Chinese Medicine for Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>Previously, the Central Medical Hall Designated Experts to Research; General Order Issued for Trial Use, with Instructions to Report Progress Regularly</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau, in accordance with the instructions from the Military Commission's Anti-Smoking Supervisor, specifically ordered all smoking cessation hospitals and Chinese medicine organizations to promote the use of Chinese medicine formulas for quitting smoking. The order and smoking cessation formulas are delivered and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Order to All Hospitals:</p>
<p>As per the Municipal Government Order No. 2340: A case involves the Anti-Smoking Supervisor's Order No. 4556, dated the 14th day of a certain month in the 16th year. It is noted that while sending smokers to hospitals for treatment is the primary principle for quitting, some smokers believe in Chinese medicine and are unwilling to take Western medicine. As long as it is non-toxic and effective, it should be promoted equally. Regarding this method of quitting smoking with Chinese medicine, the Central Chinese Medicine Hall was previously instructed to designate experts for detailed research. Now, the Hall has sent five simple Chinese medicine quitting formulas. In addition to collecting effective formulas for further distribution, the attached simple formulas from the Hall are to be used for trial purposes as deemed appropriate. The progress of the trials should be reported to the Municipal Government for record and future reference. This order includes a paper with simple Chinese medicine quitting formulas. Having received this order, besides notifying the Health Bureau, all smoking cessation hospitals and Chinese medical organizations in the city are instructed to promote trial use, and to report the progress for review. The original document is attached for the Bureau's information. This order...</p>
<p>Chinese Medicine Quitting Formulas:</p>
<p>(1) Zhao Gong's Pine Resin Ointment: Take 100 catties of fresh pine needles (preferably the ends of pine branches). First, remove impurities and insects, wash with clean water, chop on a clean mat, and then crush in a mortar. Filter the crushed pine needles three times with clean cloth and boil the juice in a steel pot. Add two catties of brown sugar to every 100 catties of pine needle juice to make a paste. For severe addiction, take one qian per dose; for mild addiction, take half a qian per dose. After sixty days, or two weeks for some, the addiction will naturally be broken. (Explanation) This formula was repeatedly tested and proven effective by the former Qing Dynasty Sichuan Governor Zhao. Wang Shixiong's "Dietary Manual" also includes this method under the "Opium" section. According to Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica," pine needles are bitter, warm, non-toxic, and good for treating wind-dampness, promoting hair growth, pacifying the five internal organs, and preventing hunger. (2) Quitting Smoking Green Bean Wine: Three catties of aged distilled liquor, two liang of mung beans. Put them together in a jar, seal tightly, and open after one hundred days. The idea is to use liquor to combat the craving, and mung beans to detoxify. (Explanation) Drink this wine whenever the craving arises, to the point of intoxication. After drinking, expect several episodes of diarrhea within three to five days (or four to five days for some), to purge the accumulated toxins from the intestines and stomach. No other medicine is needed. Continue drinking the wine as before, until the toxins are eliminated, the diarrhea stops, and the addiction is gone. (3) Qi Lin Gong's Longevity Elixir: Take the entire pumpkin plant, including the roots, vines, flowers (when the flower is just blooming), leaves, and the pumpkin itself (unripe pumpkins are even better). Wash, mash, and squeeze the juice. Regular consumption several times will completely eliminate the addiction. (Explanation) According to the "Materia Medica," pumpkins are sweet, warm, and non-toxic, and can strengthen the middle and boost qi. (4) Raw Chicken Eggs: After smoking each cigarette, immediately eat three raw chicken eggs. Do this every time, without interruption. Stop smoking after a few days, and the craving will not return, with no pain. (Explanation) Old chicken eggs nourish the body and moisturize the skin, and this aligns with the modern theory of lecithin. (5) Quisqualis indica dates: Remove the pits from red dates, stuff them with Quisqualis indica seeds, roast until cooked, and eat ten dates a day to eliminate the addiction. (Explanation) According to the "Materia Medica," dates replenish spleen qi, and Quisqualis indica can eliminate accumulations and kill parasites. There are many types of Chinese medicine formulas for quitting smoking, too numerous to list. However, even with many effective formulas, if one does not persevere, the quitting attempt will start but ultimately relapse. As the saying goes, "Quitting smoking is easy, dispelling doubt is difficult." Therefore, in addition to perseverance, one must have absolute faith in the chosen formula. With faith, doubt is eliminated; with doubt eliminated, the addiction is broken. Otherwise, even a magical elixir will be ineffective. For those who became addicted due to illness, treatment should be tailored to the illness and not treated generically.</p>

<h3>Law Clerk Shen Xinglu Extorted Money by Impersonating a Detective</h3>
<p>Colluded with a Westerner to Break into Homes to Search for Opium and Extort Money; The Victim's Relative Followed Him and Discovered the Impersonation</p>
<p>Shen Xinglu, a native of Ningbo and the law clerk of lawyer Shi Jiutang, is 29 years old and resides at No. 2, Lane 76, Broadway Road. He was previously fined 400 yuan in the French Concession for fraud, but he did not learn from his mistakes. The other day, he was arrested by the Jing'an Temple police for impersonating a detective and colluding with others to intimidate people. Li Jiren from Suzhou and a woman named Shen Lao-si were also arrested and detained. Yesterday morning, police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted Shen Xinglu in the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court for violating Article 346 of the criminal law, which is</p>
<p>Extortion by Intimidation.</p>
<p>The lawyer stated that at 3:30 PM yesterday, a Westerner and five Chinese men suddenly broke into the home of Shi Huanzhang at No. 8, Fan Zhi Lane, No. 303, Moore Road. They claimed to be Chinese and Western detectives dispatched by the police to search for heroin. They even produced a white paper with red letters resembling a court search warrant. They then went upstairs and began searching. Shi's aunt happened to be smoking opium, and the group</p>
<p>Took Advantage of the Situation</p>
<p>and demanded 1,000 yuan. Otherwise, they would take her to the police station. The aunt was terrified and negotiated with them. As a result, she immediately paid them 400 yuan, and the group left. However, Shi's relative, Wang Shoushan, secretly followed them. He saw the group walk a few steps and then hire rickshaws going towards the French Concession. Wang was very surprised because public concession detectives would not enter the French Concession. So, he continued to follow them secretly. He saw them get out of the rickshaws at Yongle Lane, Kaizier Road, and enter house number 3. Wang</p>
<p>Immediately Telephoned</p>
<p>Shi and reported it to the Jing'an Temple police station. The police sent Chinese and Western detectives, along with detectives from the French Concession, to No. 3 Yongle Lane, and arrested the three defendants. Wang Chunshan identified the defendant Shen Xinglu as one of the people who impersonated detectives at the scene. The criminal involvement of the other two, Li Jiren and Shen Lao-si, has not yet been clarified, so the prosecution has requested their detention to apprehend the accomplices. According to the testimony of witness Wang Chunshan, at 3:30 PM yesterday, he suddenly heard a knock on the door. He opened the small door</p>
<p>To Inquire About the Matter.</p>
<p>He saw a person wearing an overcoat asking if Mr. Shi was at home. He said he came to wish him a Happy New Year. Wang replied that Shi was not at home. The person then asked if Mrs. Chen was at home. Wang thought that since it was a New Year's visit and the person was alone, he opened the door and invited him in. Unexpectedly, a Westerner and three Chinese men followed him inside. They said they were dispatched by the police to search for heroin. When they saw Shi's aunt smoking opium, they became even more demanding, attempting to extort 1,000 yuan. Later, it was agreed that they would give them 400 yuan, and the rest would be paid later. The group then left with the money.</p>
<p>Wang Followed Behind.</p>
<p>If they went to the police station, he would also go back. Unexpectedly, they hired rickshaws and entered the French Concession. Wang wondered why public concession detectives would enter the French Concession. He became suspicious and followed them closely to Yongle Lane, and then telephoned Shi Huanzhang. Wang testified that the defendant Shen Xinglu was indeed among those who came and stood in the middle of the staircase, etc. Shen Xinglu confessed that yesterday he went to Shao Laoyi's house at No. 1 Yongle Lane, Kaizier Road, French Concession, to wish him a Happy New Year. He met four people named Bu, and Chinese men Lu Caigen and Chen Sibao. Shao</p>
<p>Introduced Them.</p>
<p>Shao invited him to Moore Road to collect debts. He initially did not know that Shao and others were impersonating detectives and searching for opium as a pretext for extortion. Shen Lao-si confessed that she was acquainted with Shao Laoyi and went to her little sister's house yesterday to play mahjong. She was arrested on her way home and did not know anything about this case. Li Jiren confessed that he was a relative of Shen Lao-si and had just arrived in Shanghai from Suzhou by bus at 8 PM yesterday. He was immediately arrested and did not know Shao Laoyi, nor did he know anything about the extortion. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the confessions and ordered that the three defendants be remanded in custody separately for further investigation in seven days.</p>
<h3>National Child Welfare Association Concerned About Child Criminals</h3>
<p>The National Child Welfare Association previously sent a letter to the Public Works Department requesting the establishment of a reform school for child criminals, completely separate from the Huade Road Prison. The Public Works Department's Security Committee discussed this case and planned to send a reply to the association, stating that the establishment of a reform school was considered difficult to implement. However, if the association is concerned about the reform of child criminals, it can contact the Public Works Department's prison authorities to discuss a cooperation plan, so that children who have been reformed can receive protection after being released from prison. According to the department's opinion, the establishment of such a school would require financial consideration and did not seem essential. Although the current juvenile reformatory is located inside the prison, its location is separated from the prison by walls, making it a completely independent unit. The teachers are all experienced personnel who are qualified for the job. The prison authorities believe that establishing an organization to protect children after they leave the reformatory is more important than establishing another reform school. The Security Committee also believed that since the department's finances were already strained, it was not permissible to spend a large amount of money to run this type of school. At the Public Works Department's board meeting on the 17th of this month, it was resolved to approve the Security Committee's proposal and send a reply to the National Child Welfare Association.</p>
<h3>Gas Price Increased by Five Li</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Gas Company previously sent a letter to the Public Works Department requesting permission for the company to change its billing system from April 1st of this year. According to the new system, gas sales would be billed by "units," with prices increasing by about 5% compared to the previous system. A "unit" is equivalent to 10 cubic feet under the old system. The new and old price lists set by the company are listed below:</p>
<p>The company stated that the price increase was a last resort because the franchise tax and other taxes paid to the Public Works Department had increased sharply. According to the opinion of the Public Works Department's finance director, the company's request was reasonable. The company's shareholders were able to share dividends of 8% in previous years, but this had dropped to 4% by 1935. This was because the franchise tax and taxes paid to the Public Works Department had increased significantly after the completion of the new plant in the Eastern District and the headquarters on Yu Qiaqing Road. There was no waste in other expenses in recent years. The Public Works Committee then recommended to the board that the company's request to change the billing rate be approved. This recommendation was approved at the board meeting on the 17th of this month.</p>
<h3>Massage Girl Fainted After Drinking a Cup of Coffee</h3>
<p>When She Regained Consciousness, Two Gold Rings Were Stolen; Lu Genlin, a Repeat Offender, Was Sentenced Yesterday</p>
<p>Lu Genlin, a native of this city, has no regular occupation. Recently, he impersonated the famous martial arts actor Zhang Yipeng, using various fraudulent techniques to deceive massage parlors and guides, stealing the clothes and jewelry of massage girls and guides. On the 19th of last month, Lu again defrauded the massage girls Zhou Xiaomei, Li Axiang, and Wang Gendi of the Sanmin Massage Parlor at No. 5, Lane 442, Haining Road, of one gold ring each, which he pawned for cash. The Hongkou police detective Zhang Desheng and Zhang Yaoji arrested Lu. It was discovered that Lu had not only defrauded the above three women but also cheated other female guides, including Zhang Mary Liang Ping, Zhang Caiying, Yang Zuifang, Jiang Mulan, Li Xiuying, Zhang Huizhen, Wang Aiying, and Chen Aidi, of their clothing and jewelry. The First Special District Court interrogated and detained him. This case was continued yesterday by Judge Pan Zhenyang in the Fifth Criminal Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that in addition to the seven cases that the police had already prosecuted against Lu Genlin, they had now found four more similar cases. The method of defrauding was generally the same: he would rent a room and invite the guides over, using various methods to steal their jewelry. However, there was one case that differed slightly from the others. A massage girl named Zhang Ying was summoned by the defendant to room 316 of the New New Hotel on January 6th to give him a massage. After the massage was completed, the defendant asked Zhang to drink a cup of coffee. Zhang became unconscious as a result. When she regained consciousness, the two gold rings she was wearing on her hand had been taken away by the defendant. Therefore, the defendant has committed the crime of fraud as a habitual offender and should be severely punished as a warning to others. Zhang Ying and others then testified about the circumstances of being deceived. The defendant Lu also confessed to the crimes. Judge Pan reviewed the confessions and pronounced the judgment: Lu Genlin is sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment for fraud as a habitual offender and a repeat offender. The Second Special District Court stated that Lu had also committed similar crimes in the French Concession, so it specially dispatched bailiff Li Shiquan to deliver the case and requested permission to transfer him. The court granted the request to transfer him. After the interrogation, he was sent back to serve his sentence.</p>
<h3>Zhu Xinyuan Guilty of Abortion</h3>
<p>Fined Thirty Yuan, Yang Zhong-shi Sentenced to Six Months</p>
<p>Zhu Xinyuan, a local woman residing at No. 15, Shanhaiguan Road, is 21 years old and unmarried. She had an affair with a certain man, which led to pregnancy. Fearing criticism from her mother, she discussed abortion with her friend Tan Caidi. Tan introduced Zhu to Yang Zhong-shi, a woman from Zhenjiang at No. 215, Changping Road, to perform the abortion. The agreed</p>
<p>Surgical Fee</p>
<p>was 21 yuan. On November 14th of last year, Yang managed to induce the abortion, but due to poor surgery, Zhu suffered continuous bleeding from her lower body. She groaned in bed until January 3rd, when her condition worsened. Her mother discovered the situation and rushed her to Guangren Hospital for treatment. The hospital reported the case to the Gordon Road police station. After investigation, Yang Zhong-shi was arrested and prosecuted along with Zhu Xinyuan for the crime of abortion in the First Special District Court. Because Zhu's condition was serious and she could not leave the hospital for interrogation, the presiding judge</p>
<p>Went to the Hospital</p>
<p>to take her statement. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that Zhu Xinyuan had been released from the hospital and brought to the court with the consent of the hospital, but her illness had not yet been cured, so she still needed to be sent back for treatment. Zhu Xinyuan testified that Yang Zhong-shi did perform the abortion for her. Yang Zhong-shi claimed that her daughter, Mao Tou, used to work with Xinyuan in the same yarn factory and had a quarrel and fight with her. She admitted to having beaten up Xinyuan, leading to</p>
<p>False Accusations.</p>
<p>She denied performing the abortion and hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend her. After reviewing the confessions, Judge Huang Risheng immediately pronounced the judgment in court. Zhu Xinyuan is fined 30 yuan for inducing an abortion by other means. Yang Zhong-shi is sentenced to six months of imprisonment for accepting a pregnant woman's request to perform an abortion for profit. After the sentencing, lawyer Fan Gang immediately requested that Yang Zhong-shi be allowed to post bail pending appeal. Judge Huang approved the request and ruled that she could be released on bail with an 800 yuan bond during the appeal period, pending appeal.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Thefts Increasing Daily</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Public Works Department issued an order to eliminate the non-redemption group registration stickers for rickshaws, thieves have been increasingly active, believing that the non-redemption groups organized by rickshaw merchants in the northern and southern parts of the city have been virtually abolished. On the 17th of last month, rickshaw No. 9494, which was stolen at the Beijing Wharf, and rickshaw No. 4975, which was stolen on the 20th on Chuanxin Street, Lao Beimen, disappeared without a trace. New rickshaws have been put into operation. Recently, even during the end-of-year holidays, rickshaw thefts have remained rampant. On the night of the 9th of this month, Cai Jinshan's house at No. 52, Huining Road, had two rickshaws stolen, No. 6493 and No. 8863. Xia Huaixiang's house at No. 10, Tonghuai Lane, Guohuo Road, had rickshaw No. 5565 stolen. There have also been cases of rickshaws being stolen by tricking rickshaw pullers while they are working. For example, at 11:00 AM on the 11th, rickshaw puller Lin Junyuan was tricked into delivering two bundles of incense into a lane, and the rickshaw he was pulling, No. 5391, was stolen in an instant. At noon on the 12th, rickshaw puller Xu Xinlai left his rickshaw to hire a rickshaw for a passenger, and the rickshaw he was pulling, No. 9867, was also lost. At 9:00 AM on the 13th, Cui Shigui's rickshaw, No. 9585, was also stolen after he left it to hire a rickshaw. The rickshaw owner Cai Fangsheng learned that these thieves were led by Wu Er-meizi and Rong Tiancai, who resided somewhere in the French Concession. They even offered to return the rickshaws for 12 yuan. Cai prepared the money on the evening before last (the 15th) to wait for the rickshaw to be returned. However, Rong claimed that 13 yuan was too little and used this as an excuse to delay. While the dispute was escalating, Rong took the opportunity to escape. Cai then tied up his accomplices, Liu Huaimao and Jie Zongjing, and sent them to the French Concession police station. The police station transferred them to the Ximen Branch Bureau, as the case occurred in the Chinese Concession. The branch bureau then sent them to the price investigation team for interrogation and assistance in apprehending the main criminals and accomplices in order to fundamentally eliminate the crime.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Petition This Morning to Avoid Carrying Raincoats</h3>

They were received by Mr. Shituolin of the Traffic Management Department.

<h3>An Open Letter to Ladies of All Circles from the Aid-Suiyuan Donation and Gift Exhibition</h3>
<p>Please Purchase Tickets Actively</p>
<p>The Aid-Suiyuan Donation and Gift Exhibition in Shanghai yesterday released an open letter to ladies of all circles, stating that Mr. Zhang Rongchu, a member of the Shanghai Local Association, in order to help the soldiers fighting in Suiyuan, has disregarded his personal difficulties and donated all of his exquisite furniture, precious clothing, calligraphy and paintings by famous people, and antique treasures, totaling more than 1,000 items, estimated to be worth more than 30,000 yuan. He has entrusted them to be sold at auction, with the proceeds to be sent to the front lines as a reward. Therefore, the Local Association, together with the Shanghai Women's Circle Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Comfort Association, jointly issued 10,000 donation tickets, each costing 5 yuan in national currency. The prize numbers are sequentially assigned according to the value of the items, and there are ten special prizes, each worth several hundred to more than a thousand yuan. The lottery will be drawn publicly at the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association hall at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch on March 14, 1937, with tickets matched to the drawn numbers to claim the prizes. Regardless of whether a prize is won, each ticket holder will receive a commemorative certificate signed by General Fu Zuoyi to commemorate the donation. All the prizes are currently on display on the third floor of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association for public viewing. For ease of inspection, a catalog of prizes has been printed and distributed with the tickets. Ladies of all circles are requested to purchase tickets actively and encourage friends and relatives to purchase them so that the soldiers on the front lines can receive the benefits of their loyalty. The association also stated that the number of visitors yesterday was even more enthusiastic, reaching more than 800 people throughout the day, and many people voluntarily purchased tickets.

<h3>Relief Goods for Electrical Industry Donated to Suiyuan</h3>
<p>With the passing of the old year and the dawn of the new, a sense of peace and prosperity fills Shanghai. However, the clouds of war still linger in northern Suiyuan. Colleagues in the electrical manufacturing industry of this city, driven by patriotic enthusiasm, previously donated cash to northern Suiyuan last year. Now, they have once again generously contributed their factory products, such as flashlights, batteries, and electrodes, to the soldiers defending the nation. A total of twenty-two large boxes have been packed and will be shipped to Taiyuan immediately, for further distribution to the front lines. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will follow suit upon hearing this news.</p>
<h3>Heavy Passenger Traffic on Two Railway Lines During Spring Festival</h3>
<p>During the Spring Festival period from the 2nd to the 10th of this month, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, due to heavy passenger traffic, added special trains for third and fourth class passengers as usual to meet the needs. In total, during these nine days, 575 third-class passengers departed from the Shanghai North Station, with a revenue of 371.30 yuan. There were 75,904 fourth-class passengers, with a revenue of 74,821.55 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Facilities at the Sanatorium in its 26th Year</h3>
<p>Opium has plagued China for a century, not only harming the body but also wasting money. It is a major obstacle to the rejuvenation of our Chinese nation. Since Director-General Chiang resolutely banned opium, the 26th year (of the Republic) marks a final turning point for opium addicts. However, most people smoke opium to alleviate pain caused by illness, leading to addiction. Therefore, quitting smoking is often feared. The Shanghai Lung Disease Sanatorium at 4 Daxi Road has recently added an opium detoxification department. The location is completely separated from lung disease patients, only admitting opium addicts. There is no risk of contracting lung disease. Regardless of age, amount of smoking, or presence of illness, patients can quit completely and painlessly, unknowingly. To save the poor, hospital fees for third and fourth-class wards are waived. There are two types of detoxification programs: a special class for 100 yuan, and a second class for 80 yuan, and a third class for 60 yuan, regardless of the amount of opium smoked. All oral and injectable medications are included, with no other fees.</p>
<h3>Post Office Smooths Out Mail to Sichuan</h3>
<p>Low Water Level in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River; Large Numbers of Civilian Boats Hired for Transfer</p>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1389 states: Recently, the water level in the Yichang-Chongqing section of the upper Yangtze River has been low, resulting in few sailings and a backlog of goods. This has led to a large accumulation of parcels destined for Sichuan and Guizhou provinces in Yichang and Chongqing. As a result, the transfer of parcels to Sichuan has been inevitably delayed. To avoid prolonged delays, the Post Office has specially hired dozens of civilian boats to travel between Yichang and Chongqing during this period when shallow-draft vessels cannot resume sailing. It is estimated that the journey from Yichang to Chongqing will take approximately 30 days. This is hereby notified to all. Director Zha Peilin, February 15th.</p>
<h3>Architect Zhuang Jun Returns Home After Inspection Tour</h3>
<p>Architect Zhuang Jun, who recently returned to China after an inspection tour of Europe and the United States, has extensively studied architecture during his travels across Europe and the New World. He has also observed progress in both material and spiritual aspects in various countries, further emphasizing the need for China to catch up quickly. Regarding architecture, his observations suggest that building forms are increasingly economical and practical. Therefore, few people are now creating ancient styles. The welfare of the common people is at the heart of social issues, leading to more construction of housing for the common people in various countries. He has gained much from this trip and will pay special attention after returning to China.</p>
<h3>Merchants and Residents of Longhua Town Petition for Rectification of the Ancient Temple</h3>
<p>Wandering Monks Occupy the Temple, Neglecting Practice; Debts Go Unpaid, Leading to Abuse</p>
<p>Longhua Temple in Longhua Town, southwest of this city, is a famous ancient temple in Shanghai. Every year in the third month of the lunar calendar, during the temple fair, ladies and gentlemen from all over come to visit the scenic spot. However, since Abbot Xingkong retired, the Buddhist Association once sent a monk to take over, resulting in disputes. It is now learned that the temple is still occupied by Yuanming, a wandering monk from Sichuan, causing internal chaos. Local people have risen up to drive him away. Liu Peiren and others, merchants and residents of Longhua, submitted a petition to the municipal government the day before yesterday, requesting that the Buddhist Association be instructed to appoint a high-ranking monk to take over and reorganize the temple. The petition states: "Longhua Ancient Temple is one of the monasteries in Shanghai. Before June of last year, Abbot Xingkong retired due to old age, and Yuanming immediately occupied the temple, claiming to be the abbot. His various illegal acts are too numerous to describe. As a result, monks from all directions have left. Now, among the 70-80 monks in the temple, all are wandering monks from Yuanming's hometown of Sichuan Province. Not only do they neglect practice in the temple, but they also engage in many improper behaviors. All the temple's belongings have been pawned. The monks often cause disturbances, with no discipline or rules left. There are many outstanding debts. We merchants, who do business in the town, have outstanding debts from the temple for goods purchased or financial transactions. During the recent lunar New Year, when we went to the temple to collect debts, we were abused and even assaulted by the wandering monks. If this continues, the famous ancient temple will be controlled by wandering monks with no morality. Not only will our creditor's rights be unsecured, but it is also feared that this will violate the government's original intention to preserve historical sites. Therefore, we jointly petition the government to quickly expel Yuanming and instruct the Buddhist Association to appoint a high-ranking monk to take over and reorganize the temple."</p>

<h3>Old Servant of Hong Yanbin Wrongfully Accused of Theft; Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Hong Yanbin, a native of Ningbo, currently residing at 31 Wanguan Lane, Luban Road in the French Concession, is now the director of the Maritime Affairs Bureau in Hankou. When Hong was a compradore on merchant shipping vessels, Sun Kengsheng (approximately 30 years old this year), a native of Shaoxing, worked as a tea server for Hong. Later, when Hong was transferred, Sun also left his job and returned to his hometown. Recently, Sun learned in his hometown that his former employer, Hong Yanbin, had been promoted to a new position. Therefore, he came to Shanghai last year and asked Hong's family to hire him or recommend him, temporarily staying at Hong's residence. The day before yesterday, thieves suddenly visited Hong's home, stealing silverware and other decorations from the living room. The next morning, when this was discovered, the servants suspected Sun of the theft and gossiped behind his back. When Sun learned of this, he impulsively took his own life. At 10 a.m. on the 16th, he used a kitchen knife to cut his throat in Hong's kitchen, bleeding all over the floor, and collapsing on the ground. This was discovered by the servants, who informed Hong's wife, Shi. She immediately reported to the French police, who sent Sun to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The police also dispatched detectives to investigate the theft at Hong's home in order to find and arrest the thieves.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Ignores Wife's Upkeep; Rings Bell to Air Grievance</h3>
<p>Lawyer Ma, 22 years old, is from Yixing. His wife, Ma Tan, 23 years old, maiden name Longzhen, suddenly went to the front of the Nanshi District Court at 3 p.m. yesterday to air her grievance, complaining that she married Ma in the 12th year of the Republic and had a son and a daughter. The son, Jiemei, eight years old, died on September 28th of last year. The daughter, Yiqing, is currently 12 years old and attends elementary school in Yixing. Seven years ago, Ma's treatment of her became indifferent and he neglected her livelihood. On April 11th of the year before last, she came to Shanghai and caught him cohabitating with a female university student named Lin at 56 Hehe Lane, Xiafei Road. The case was brought to the police, and Lawyer Wu mediated, stipulating that he would provide her with a living allowance of 26 yuan per month. She returned to Yixing. However, starting on January 23rd of last year, her living allowance was cut off. Unable to bear it, she came to Shanghai on January 20th of this year to find Ma, but he avoided meeting her. Therefore, she is temporarily staying at 86 Xinling Village, Caishi Road, but her livelihood is unsustainable. She was forced to come here to voice her grievance. Following the instructions of well-meaning people, she went to ring the grievance bell. She was then questioned in court by the prosecutor and left crying.</p>

We were shocked to read the news article in the Shen Bao on the 16th of this month, "Abortion Case at Dasheng Hospital: Civil Suit for Over Ten Thousand Yuan." Mr. Yan Pinzheng has always been known to abide by the law. Whether he is guilty or not in this case, we should wait for the legal judgment. The truth will be revealed. However, the report stated that the defendant has hired someone to reconcile with the victim's family and compensate for the losses in order to reduce the sentence. This is absolutely not the case. I believe this is based on inaccurate rumors. Please send a letter on our behalf requesting a correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Lan Xuzhang, February 17.</p>

<h3>Letter from Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, and Others to Tungyee Creditors (Continued)</h3>
<p>Please discuss the percentage of recovery again. According to the mediation plan and repayment method,</p>
<p>The above table is based on the total amount of existing assets, properly organized and distributed, or converted into cash for return, or the property rights and claims are guaranteed by stocks and bonds, all of which refer to speedy mediation and early resumption of business. If we follow the bankruptcy procedure and liquidate step by step, this percentage is very difficult to achieve. The reason is ㊀ that the value of the property varies depending on the method of disposal. Bankruptcy requires auction, while liquidation can be negotiated. The price of an auction is necessarily lower than that of a negotiated transaction. ㊁ Negotiation allows for waiting for a better price, while auction does not have this opportunity. ㊂ Buyers in an auction will wait until the price is reduced to the lowest level, while negotiation can be based on the market price as a standard. In special cases, it may even be higher than the market price. ㊃ Mediation and resumption of business allows for interest to accrue on funds without interest, and non-productive assets become productive. ㊄ Some accounts are easier to collect after resumption of business than after bankruptcy. Summarizing these six points, according to the accountant's realistic estimate, the obvious loss would be at least one million yuan. Then how can the percentage be high? Moreover, quick recovery can generate profits, while delayed recovery only leads to consumption. If interest is included in the calculation, the advantages and disadvantages are even more different.</p>
<p>Please use practical examples to prove this. In recent years, financial events have been frequent, and bank failures are common. Examples include Minghua Bank, Wuhua Bank, Wing On Silver Company, Meihua Bank, Jiande Bank, China Industrial Bank, Dahuhu Bank, Ningbo Industrial Bank, and Guangdong Bank. Among them, Minghua, Wuhua, Wing On, and Meihua have been in a stalemate until now, with no end in sight. Jiande and China Industrial Bank have been bankrupt for many years, although they eventually reached a settlement, the creditors have suffered huge losses. The delays in Riye, Shijie, and Dahuhu have also caused great losses. Ningbo Industrial Bank has experienced several twists and turns and has only recently resumed business. However, having a solution is always better than having no solution. Only Guangdong Bank stopped business not long ago and resolutely mediated. On the day of its resumption of business, it was a great success. The creditors' losses were relatively minimal. If these banks had promptly sought mutual understanding and assistance from both debtors and creditors and engaged in reconciliation or mediation, they could have saved countless time, eliminated countless expenses, and reduced countless losses. The recovery of claims could be quick, and the percentage could be high. Why wait for a long time, and ultimately have to take a huge discount or even disappear? As the saying goes, learn from the past to guide the future. Since the advantages and disadvantages are so obvious, how can the creditors not be able to distinguish them? Why are some still hesitant, suspicious, and unable to decide? Is it because they still have doubts about the mediation plan, such as: doubts about the real value of stocks and bonds, fears about the responsibility of shareholders, and concerns about the funds for the resumption of business? Now we will explain them one by one, as follows:</p>
<p>First, regarding the real value of stocks and bonds, the value of stocks and bonds depends on whether the assets they represent are reliable. After Tungyee stopped business, accountant Xi Yushu cleaned up and reviewed the accounts. Later, the court ruled for bankruptcy and appointed accountant Li Ding to clean up and review the accounts. Later, due to mediation, accountants were selected to participate in the review. The quantity and nature of its assets have long been publicly studied and can be seen in the liquidator's report and the bankruptcy administrator's files. Therefore, the mediation plan proposes to extract 1.36 million yuan of relatively reliable assets from the assets of 1.7 million yuan as the new company's capital, which is reasonable. Although this asset, if fully converted into cash, may not actually be 1.36 million yuan, the difference will not be very large. It must be understood that valuation and realization have inherent differences in nature. For example, if cash is used to purchase property in the morning and the property is converted into cash in the evening, the value cannot be the same. Moreover, a company's large and complex assets have a fixed value for wealth creation and a special value for effectiveness, which is difficult to measure in cash. In short, the new company's capital of 1.36 million yuan in the mediation plan certainly represents reliable assets, and its denominations have considerable circulation value. It is by no means inconsistent with the reality. Those who doubt the value of the shares are empty and have not deeply examined the asset situation. As for the assets represented by non-interest-bearing bonds, ㊀ overdrafts, ㊁ credit loans, ㊂ temporary accounts payable, and ㊃ collection items, the certainty of these four items is certainly not as good as the former. However, according to estimates, they are not entirely unreliable. In the future, those who buy bonds for profit after the mediation is established must exist. Moreover, the new company's profits are guaranteed, and its circulation value is unquestionable.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the issue of shareholder responsibility, the new company is still a limited liability company. According to the Company Law, the responsibility of shareholders is limited to the shares they hold. In other words, if the new company unfortunately fails, shareholders will have no other responsibility except for the loss of the value of their shares. Now, assuming that the new company does not offer savings or long-term deposits, and its business scope is limited to several stable and liquid trust businesses or banking businesses, not only will shareholders not be liable, but even shareholders who are elected as directors or supervisors will not be liable if they do not engage in embezzlement. Why? Not offering savings makes the new company a purely limited liability company, and even directors and supervisors do not bear joint and unlimited liability. At worst, shareholders who do not intend to continue operating can sell their shares at any time and completely transfer all their shareholder rights and responsibilities to others, and the issue of responsibility will no longer arise.

<h3>Yarn</h3>
<p>Yarn's Reactionary Decline</p>
<p>Closing Shows Further Pullback, Resulting in Only a Slight Drop</p>
<p>The yarn market declined in the morning, but suddenly rose towards closing in the afternoon. The market situation was quieter than the previous day, as major players were largely inactive. However, a portion of twenty-count "Five Blessings Shepherd" yarn, totaling 4,000 bales, was released from the Ewo factory (Jardine Matheson). Meanwhile, the Osaka Sanpin yarn market trended downwards, and general sentiment remained weak. Nevertheless, current yarn business was reportedly not bad, with strong demand continuing from Yunnan, Tianjin, and other inland regions.</p>
<p>Major Players Release Marked Yarn</p>
<p>In the forward marked yarn market, prices trended downwards for all months at the opening due to the excessive bullishness of the previous day. Simultaneously, Osaka Sanpin yarn fell by 3.1 to 4 yuan, further dampening confidence. As a result, a reactionary decline occurred, with massive selling from companies like Jin Chang, Chang Feng, and Heng Yi, loosening the market. However, there was no indication of major players absorbing the supply. Current yarn trading was not as active as the previous day. Consequently, prices for all months fell by 9 jiao to 1.24 yuan compared to the closing prices of the 10th. At the afternoon opening, the market was calm, with prices slightly declining, as Chang Feng and others continued selling. The Sanpin yarn market was experiencing a severe downturn. By closing, current yarn trading was reported to be more active than in the morning, with over 2,400 bales changing hands. Chang Feng suddenly began buying, causing prices for all months to jump by 9 jiao to 1.2 yuan. The selling consisted of 2,350 bales from Heng Yi, 750 bales from Cheng Ji, 2,800 bales from Jin Chang, 600 bales from Tai Xing, 900 bales from Ren Feng, 1,600 bales from Wang Tai Xing, and 6,250 bales from Chang Feng. The buying consisted of 2,300 bales from Da Fu, 900 bales from Da Feng, 1,050 bales from Xing Chang, 2,250 bales from Tai Chang, 1,100 bales from Run Kang, 3,050 bales from Xin Cheng, and 950 bales from Shen Ji. The daily high and low prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Sales of Current Yarn Remain Strong</p>
<p>A total of 2,492 bales of current yarn were purchased by various guilds throughout the day. Selling prices were stable. The purchase amounts by each guild are listed below.</p>
<p>The cotton market initially declined but then recovered, showing a tendency for large rises followed by small corrections. However, the overseas cotton industry continued to weaken, leading to moderate confidence. Yet, some speculators remained strongly bullish on prices and did not ease their buying efforts. Therefore, the overall sentiment remained firm.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Remains Strong</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot cotton market, prices declined due to falling prices for American and Indian cotton, as well as the excessive gains of the previous day, leading to widespread profit-taking and a sudden loosening of holdings. Prices for all months fell by 0.35 to 0.6 yuan. However, demand was particularly strong for the current month. As a result, prices for all months fell by 0.35 to 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, except for the current month, which remained unchanged. At the afternoon opening, the market was calm, with prices for all months falling by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. After the first trading session, prices rose with the yarn market. Consequently, prices for all months rose by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan compared to the morning closing price. The selling consisted of 2,100 dan from Yi Chang, 2,700 dan from Yuan Yi, 1,600 dan from Ren Feng, 1,900 dan from Tong Ji, 3,900 dan from Heng Yi, 2,000 dan from Ming De, 8,100 dan from Tai Xing, 3,400 dan from Chang Yu, 5,400 dan from Da Chang Cheng, 2,500 dan from Da Chang, 3,500 dan from Sheng Yuan, 4,100 dan from Yi Kang, and 5,500 dan from Yuan Xing Chang. The buying consisted of 1,700 dan from Xie Cheng, 5,500 dan from Feng Tai, 4,000 dan from De Da, 6,800 dan from Da Fu, 2,700 dan from Ju Xing, 2,200 dan from Yu Da, 2,400 dan from Geng Feng, 4,100 dan from Chang Feng, 2,000 dan from Fu Kang, 6,000 dan from Xin Cheng, 16,400 dan from Chang He, and 2,100 dan from Xin Yong. The daily high and low prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Current Consumption Improving</p>
<p>Factories are experiencing more active yarn sales, leading to increasing demand for raw materials. Source unknown.</p>
<p>Increased Hedging Sales of American Cotton with Loaned Funds</p>
<p>American cotton opened lower, with prices for all months falling by one pound sterling. The initial market was more active due to increased hedging sales of cotton with loaned funds. Sales also occurred in New Orleans. Speculators largely took profits. Simultaneously, the stock market and other commodities declined uniformly, leading to strong selling pressure. Dealers were the only buyers. Japanese brokers bought March contracts at lower prices. At the closing, the public sold, leading to market weakness. Spot prices fell by nine pounds sterling, and futures fell by six to twelve pounds sterling. Spot prices for English cotton were unchanged, and futures fell by one point. Indian cotton initially rose due to scattered dealer buying but weakened due to continued profit-taking by speculators. Overall, Pingguoer rose/fell by 0.25 rupee, Omlara fell by 0.55 to 0.75 rupee, and Bairokhi fell by 0.75 rupee. Original telegraphic report on the left (dated 17th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecasts for the 17th were: Bairokhi at 220 rupees, Omlara at 202 rupees, and Pingguoer at 176 rupees, all falling by half a rupee.</p>

<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth Sales Fairly Active</p>
<p>Dye Factories in This Street Slow to Buy</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market continued its positive trend. Prices for most goods remained generally stable. Tianjin and Guangdong guilds continued to show strong demand for white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. Tianjin guilds mainly purchased "Flower Bird Dragon Gate" fine cloth produced in Dongpi and Qingdao. Shanghai factories' "Blue Double Fish" fine cloth and fine twill were also procured. Altogether, over 300 bales of current fine cloth were purchased, along with nearly 100 pieces of fine twill, coarse twill, lightweight coarse cloth, serge, line fabric, and poplin from this factory. Guangzhou and Wuzhou ordered over 200 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, various grades of coarse cloth, and poplin from this factory. Dye factories in this street were slow to buy due to not yet having resumed operations. Shantou, Xiamen, Jinan, and other guilds showed considerable demand for printed fabric, satin, serge, and drill. Fuzhou guilds mainly purchased blue cloth and plain twill. Zhejiang routes Ningbo, Shaoxing, Wenzhou, and Taizhou purchased various weights of coarse cloth, Dongpi fine cloth, and mixed colors. Small amounts were also traded with various ports along the Yangtze River, mostly at opening red market prices.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>After Consecutive Gains</p>
<p>Public Debt Bulls Take Profits</p>
<p>Class C Down Over One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants' Stock Exchange experienced slight uncertainty. Some bulls exited the market, mostly seasoned bulls taking profits. However, overall confidence had not weakened. Various rumors circulating previously could not be confirmed. The temporary decline was due to the exiting of some players, preventing prices from falling sharply. Market sentiment remained strong. With only five days left in the February futures, another round of infighting was expected. Yesterday, after an initial rise at the opening, prices fell. This month's Class E opened sharply higher by 0.9 jiao, causing some bulls to exit, resulting in a subsequent decline of 0.6 jiao. The market moved from high to low, causing a slight shift in sentiment. Class C fell the most, down 1.2 yuan, due to the large gains of the previous day. Other classes fell by only 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. In the second session, Class E fell by 0.5 to 0.6 jiao, making up for the deficiency of the first session. Class C recovered by 0.15 jiao. The market gradually stabilized. In terms of buying and selling, Numbers 5, 10, 35, and 47 sold in the opening session, while Numbers 4 and 11 bought. In the second session, Numbers 10 and 47 continued to sell, while Number 35 switched to buying. Number 4 continued to absorb. As a result, prices fell by 0.2 jiao to over 1 yuan. The total trading volume was 8,985,000 yuan. The resulting gains and losses are compared in the table below (units in 100 yuan trading units).</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Futures Flour Suddenly Turns to Selling</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat Plummets, Changing Sentiment. Heavy Trading Activity in the Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market exhibited a sharp decline across all months, primarily due to the plummeting prices of foreign wheat. Chicago wheat fell sharply, with near-term prices down 0.6 jiao and long-term prices down 2.1 jiao. Canadian wheat fell 0.7 jiao for near-term and 0.56 jiao for long-term. Liverpool wheat fell 1-2 pence. As a result, the market sentiment shifted unanimously due to the sharp decline in foreign wheat. The opening price for the current month fell to 1.13 yuan, a decrease of 0.725 jiao from the previous day. However, intense selling by the bulls was met with relentless buying by factories, causing the price to recover by 0.02 yuan. Trading activity for March/April was extremely high, with initial declines of 0.04-0.05 yuan followed by continued weakness. July new flour was initially slightly lower by 0.01-0.02 yuan due to large-scale hedging by overseas players, but subsequently weakened as factories also began hedging. Based on the current situation, the decline was partly due to foreign wheat prices, but also due to changes in holdings and increased activity from non-industry bulls, all seemingly focused on this.</p>
<p>Both Futures and Spot Wheat Fall by 0.06-0.07 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market experienced a general decline in all months after the morning opening. This was due to the continued decline in foreign wheat prices, with falls ranging from 0.2-0.3 jiao to 0.56-0.7 jiao and 1-2 pence. The market's focus is currently largely dependent on foreign prices. Seeing such a sharp decline, resistance was difficult. Opening prices immediately fell by 0.06-0.07 yuan. Subsequently, trading activity decreased, with less movement. It is rumored that the majority of the near-term standard contracts were held by Tianjin factories. Although these were formal transactions, the market value of the goods was not in the Chinese style, so it was close to speculation. However, the holdings were absorbed and not released, so there was little dynamism. The spot wheat market also saw price declines of 0.06-0.07 yuan across the board due to the fall in standard foreign wheat prices. Opened at 6.7 yuan for Bengbu Yanghe wheat and 6.65 yuan for Jiangbei wheat. Reported that over 8,000 bags were traded.</p>
<p>Xi'an Guild Resumes Purchasing Ji Jing Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market saw approximately 10,000 bags arrive, with a corresponding amount sold, stabilizing the market. However, inventories remained abundant and new arrivals continued to pour in, leading to pressure from holders to sell quickly, resulting in a weak market. However, sales of Ke Hua rice were active, with new inquiries from Shantou and Beiyang in addition to the usual sales within this street and to Xiamen. The Xi'an guild, which had been inactive for some time, resumed operations with the return of peace and the restoration of transportation, purchasing 600-700 bags of Ji Jing rice. However, the lack of purchasing from the Guangdong guild prevented the market from improving. A total of 8,394 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,500 bags of Hunan rice, and 250 bags of Han coarse rice were offered throughout the day.</p>
<p>Year-End Rice Purchases Satisfied, No Large Outlets for Eating Rice</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total arrivals from various guilds numbered over 30, with approximately 6,400-6,500 shi of goods. Of these, 14-15 were of Bo Dao rice. With sufficient year-end rice purchases completed by local households, sales were very quiet. Only Zi Shang rice saw some activity, with Qingdao and Tianjin guilds purchasing 2,500-2,600 bags of Bo Dao rice, leading to a weakening market. Hou Geng prices fell by 0.15-0.2 yuan. Bo Dao rice was barely holding steady. Du Jian was slightly soft. Yin Yuan saw no market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, arrivals from various ports downstream numbered over 30 vessels. Sales were even weaker than the previous market. White Geng prices fell slightly by around 0.1 jiao. Bo Dao prices fell slightly. Early rice was scarce, with some small demand and stable prices. Yangbu Xian prices fell slightly by several fen to 0.1 jiao. Du Jian prices were stable. Ke Jian prices were weak. Bai Yuan prices fell slightly by several fen to 0.1 jiao. Prices for all other goods exhibited a downward trend.</p>
<p>Foreign Firm Sesame Falls 0.15 Yuan</p>
<p>Soybeans Also Drop 0.05-0.06 Yuan</p>
<p>Foreign firm sesame was facing stagnant sales as the foreign firms remained inactive, with only the Central Trust Bureau making inquiries. Yesterday, a total of 300 tons were transacted in both the morning and afternoon sessions at prices of 14.9 and 14.85 yuan, respectively, down 0.15 yuan from the previous market. Current spot raw sesame was only being sold in small quantities by local merchants, with 50 bags of Haozhou sesame and 70 bags of Kuixi Kou sesame traded. Prices remained unchanged. Soybean purchases by oil pressing factories have tightened significantly due to the continued decline in the Dalian market, and sales have also decreased in other markets, causing prices to fall by 0.05-0.06 yuan. A total of four truckloads of Bengbu beans, 152 bags of Xicheng beans, 147 bags of Dingjia Zhou beans, 800 bags of Sha Huang beans, 24 bags of Du beans, and 400 bags of Zha beans were traded.</p>
<p>Dalian Repeatedly Reports Declines, Standard Oil Bean Cakes Also Fall Sharply</p>
<p>The standard oil bean cake market initially saw some improvement in sentiment due to a temporary rebound in the Dalian market. However, the Dalian market's weakness was difficult to reverse, and prices soon declined. Brokerage firms, having received the news earlier, were the first to sell off. Yesterday, Dalian telegraphs reported further sharp declines, causing even greater fear and weakness. Brokerage firms continued to sell actively, leading to an immediate sharp decline in opening prices. Standard oil fell sharply by 0.6-0.7 yuan, sesame cakes fell by 0.02-0.03 yuan, and standard soybeans fell by nearly 0.1 yuan in the near month and a significant 0.18 yuan in the far month.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Hainan Red Arrives with Over 5,000 Bags Yesterday</p>
<p>Chao Sugar Telegram Reports Increase of 0.3-0.4 Yuan. Zhang Diaoqing Opens with Over 2,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend for foreign sugar was flat and soft, while domestic Qing and Red sugars remained firm due to the rise in production prices. The guild trading desk traded 24 coarse white current goods at 20.95 yuan, down 0.05 yuan. Transit goods were at 7.55 yuan. East White No. 4 current goods (J mark) were offered at 23.1 yuan but were not traded. Other goods were offered at the original price without any transactions. This factory's cotton white Zhenji No. 1 was 22 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were discounted. According to a telegram from Chao sugar yesterday at 5 PM, Qing, Red, and White sugars all rose by 0.3-0.4 yuan. The sales agents continued to offer Chongti Qing at 14.25 yuan, Huanggang Qing at 14 to 14.1 yuan, and cotton red at 15.7 to 15.64 yuan, totaling over 600 bags.

The sale included 285 bags of Shunde Factory's Five Sheep Coarse White at 22.8 yuan, 490 bags from Dongguan also at 22.8 yuan, 1,000 bags from Shantou also at 22.7 yuan, and 20 bags of Huizhou Medium Sand White at 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Hainan Red was imported yesterday by the Jiaying vessel, with 5,030 bags arriving. As the inventory gradually increased, it was difficult for the sales agents to continue to raise prices.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Vegetables Open at 27.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Golden Needle Vegetables Tend to Remain Stable and Refined. Yesterday, 90 bags of Xuzhou vegetables were offered at 27. yuan but sales were not yet significant. Otherwise, the increase would not have been limited to this.</p>
<p>Sunflower Seeds Opened at over 100 bags, priced at 15 yuan. Black melon seeds also had some transactions, with higher grades offered at 25 yuan and lower grades reduced slightly.</p>
<p>Dried Longan Sales from all sides were not yet active. Although production prices had generally risen, the sales agents had not yet officially opened. According to customer opinions, the top grades had to add two to three yuan, the middle grades were thinner and could perhaps be cheaper, while the lower grades seemed more stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>African Firms Purchase Jili Silk</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese and American silk markets declined slightly. New York recent term fell by 0.03 yuan and far term fell by 0.02 yuan. Yokohama spot rose by 5 yuan and futures fell by 5 yuan. Lyon was unchanged. In the sea silk market, white factory Jing B grade Yangfan silk's offered price was 800 yuan, higher than before the new year, but there were no transactions. Foreign firms slightly sold the red market yesterday. For example, Xinfu sold Green Sailor grade 20-22 denier in 10 packs, priced at 750 yuan. It was said that the silk was sold by the Nie Household, so the price was lower. Currently, silk merchants are holding prices for these silks at around 780 yuan. Yesterday, a small amount of Jili silk was traded with African firms, such as Red Peach brand priced at 695 yuan and Golden Bird brand at 685 yuan. The market prices were similar to before the new year, but market sentiment was stronger.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>This Factory's Yuan Nails Should Not Be Sold</p>
<p>Recent transactions of Yuan nails from this factory have been mostly purchased by foreign guilds. The inventory of fellow merchants is limited, resulting in insufficient allocation. Furthermore, due to a shortage of raw materials, the factory's output is shallow, so the offered price is 13.5 yuan per barrel, 0.5 yuan higher than the red market. It is found that there are as many as 400-500 barrels offered. Other small color varieties are strongly positioned due to less output, such as four-fen sizes at 17 yuan, five-fen sizes at 18.5 yuan, and six-fen sizes at 20 yuan. However, Pi goods are ultimately unpopular varieties, so not many are offered.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>Tung Oil Industry Profits Not as Good as Last Year</p>
<p>Tung oil is a special product of our country. All paint factories in the world rely on it as a raw material. Therefore, our country's export trade ranked first last year, and the domestic output has also increased year by year. Last year, the national export volume was estimated at more than 100,000 tons. Although the central market is in Hankou, many foreign merchants also conduct procurement deep into Sichuan and Hunan. This port's foreign trade volume was about 10,000 tons for the whole year. Since the establishment of the Industrial Department's vegetable oil factory in the second half of the year, all exported oil must be refined by the factory. On the surface, it seems to have concentrated the industry, but foreign merchants' oil factories still refine oil as before, while Chinese merchants engaged in this industry are subject to more restrictions and not as free as foreign merchants. Therefore, the profits of tung oil firms in this port last year were not as good as the previous year. According to people in the industry, it is feared that this year will be even worse than last year. The surplus dividends of each firm are listed below (omitted).</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>Fennel Spring Plate Increases 2 Yuan</p>
<p>Fennel spring plate continued to trend upward. Yesterday, it was heard that sales agents offered over 200 pieces of Nanning fennel at 39 yuan and over 100 packs of Beihai fennel at 38 yuan, an increase of about 2 yuan compared to before the big settlement.</p>
<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>Living Expenses Index Soars in the 25th Year</p>
<p>Purchasing Power of Silver Dollar Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs announced the cost of living index for the city in the 25th year, stating that the cost of living index for workers in the city was highest in the 19th year, with an annual total index of 116.79. Since the economic decline began in the autumn and winter of the 20th year, the index has gradually decreased year by year. By the 22nd year, it was only 97.13, a decrease of 16.83% compared to the 19th year. There was not much change in the 23rd year. The 24th year showed signs of recovery. After the promulgation and implementation of the legal tender act on November 4th of that year, the value of currency decreased, and prices uniformly rebounded. The annual index slightly increased. This year (the 25th year) continues the upward trend of the previous year, and the index continues to rise. The second half of the year, in particular, showed a clear upward trend. This is mainly because the harvest in various regions this year was still considered abundant, the rural economy gradually showed signs of recovery, the sales of essential goods were smooth, and the continuous economic decline and reduced production in recent years meant that inventories were limited. Once sales were brisk, the supply felt inadequate. In addition, the improvement of international market conditions, the effectiveness of the currency reform, and various political and economic influences also contributed to the increase in prices. As wholesale prices rose, the cost of living index also increased. This was not only the case in this city, but also in other cities such as Tianjin, Beiping, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Nanning, etc., where the cost of living index or retail price index also showed the same increase in percentage. This is clear evidence that China's economic situation has begun to turn around. The following is a table of the cost of living index for workers in Shanghai for each month of the 25th year.</p>
<p>Shanghai Workers' Cost of Living Index for the 25th Year of the Republic of China (15th Year of the Republic of China equals 100)</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the total index often follow the same trend as the food category. Starting from January of this year, it rose monthly. By March, the index reached 107.10, an increase of 9.80% compared to October of last year (the food category index was 93.65 in January and 99.89 in March). In April and May, the total index fell due to a drop in the food category. From June, the trend resumed upwards. Until September, all category indexes except fuel were lower than the previous month, so the total index declined. In October, the food category index slightly decreased, but the clothing index rose sharply, and the total index was slightly higher. This was the only month in the entire year when the food category index differed from its usual trend. There was not much change in October. In December, the prices of various commodities rose sharply, and the total index reached 108.86, the highest peak since September of the 21st year (the food category index was 101.31). The annual average was 105.04, an increase of 6.40% compared to the previous year. The highest monthly value for the whole year was 108.86 in December, and the lowest was 102.68 in May, a difference of only 6.18, and the trend was relatively stable.</p>
<p>In September of the 24th year, each silver dollar could be exchanged for 341.35 copper coins. On November 4th, the government announced the implementation of legal tender, which sharply reduced the exchange rate to 299.55 coins. Soon after, the Ministry of Finance stipulated that each dollar should be worth 300 copper coins, with no fluctuations allowed. Although in reality, due to supply and demand, it was impossible to fix the rate at the legally mandated 300 coins (such as the purchase of copper coins and the approaching end of the year, which created high demand), the average exchange rate in December of this year was only 296 coins. However, this was only a difference of more than 7 coins compared to the highest average exchange rate in March, when each dollar could be exchanged for 303.15 coins. This difference was still limited. In the 23rd year, the difference between the highest and lowest copper coin exchange rates was more than 30 coins.</p>

<h3>The Loyalty of Shi Quan</h3>
<p>— Ru Bi</p>
<p>A loyal and righteous person is incompatible with a traitor.</p>
<p>During the late Northern Song Dynasty, the Jin army occupied Bianjing, and Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong were taken to the north by the Jin. The world was in chaos for a time, and some loyal and righteous heroes were unwilling to surrender to the Jin. They all ran to the high mountains and forests to become bandits. Shi Quan also became a great king on Mount Taihang.</p>
<p>Later, Emperor Gaozong ascended the throne, and the Song Dynasty retained half of the country. He appointed generals such as Yue Fei and Han Shizhong to fight against the Jin. For a time, there was an atmosphere of restoration. Shi Quan had long heard the stories of Yue Fei's loyalty and righteousness in the world, and now he was a marshal leading troops to fight against the Jin. This was a good opportunity to serve the country. Shi Quan inspected his followers and joined Marshal Yue's army to work together to recover lost territory and wipe out national humiliation.</p>
<p>Shi Quan followed Marshal Yue, killing enemies in the east and west, conquering in the south and north, suppressing many rebels, and fighting many battles with the Jin. They were truly invincible, and the Jin soldiers were terrified upon hearing their name. Even children were afraid of the name of the Yue Family Army.</p>
<p>Who knew that at that time, a great traitor appeared, Prime Minister Qin Hui. He had originally been captured by the Jin, but was later released and rose to the position of prime minister. He always helped the Jin and harmed his own country. He strongly advocated making peace with the Jin and not fighting against them. However, Marshal Yue's views were exactly the opposite of his, so he hated Marshal Yue. Therefore, just when Marshal Yue had defeated the Jin army at Zhuxian Town in Henan, and was preparing to march north to raid the Jin's base camp, and at the same time, the loyal heroes in the north were preparing to respond to the Yue Family Army, Qin Hui falsely issued an imperial decree, sending twelve gold tablets in a row, summoning Marshal Yue back to the capital, framing him in prison, and then killing Marshal Yue and his three sons at Fengbo Pavilion.</p>
<p>When the news of Marshal Yue's murder reached the camp, the entire army, both officers and soldiers, were as if they had lost their parents, and their cries shook the earth. The generals all said: "Now that traitors are in power in the court, single-mindedly selling out the country, what is the use of our fighting battles at the risk of our lives? Even Marshal Yue, with such great merits, was killed by the traitors. We will not be able to escape in the future. It is better to save our lives and go back, and wait for an opportunity to repay the country and kill all the enemies."</p>
<p>So most of the generals dispersed, some went home, and some still went up the mountain to become great kings.</p>
<p>Shi Quan returned to Mount Taihang, depressed all day long, only thinking about things. He thought: "I am Chinese, and I should be loyal to the country. I have received great kindness from Marshal Yue, and I should also repay him, and inherit Marshal Yue's ambition. Although we cannot fight against the Jin for a while, and cannot kill all the enemies, killing the traitors is the same. I should go to Lin'an to kill Qin Hui, eliminate a great harm for the country, and avenge Marshal Yue. I should do this, so that I am worthy of being a great man."</p>
<p>Shi Quan thought for a few days, and the more he thought, the more he felt that he should go to kill Qin Hui, so he decided to go to Lin'an to do this great thing. He did not tell his other brothers, and on a night with a big moon, he quietly went down the mountain.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Shi Quan traveled day and night, eating when hungry and drinking when thirsty. When he arrived in Lin'an. He was in no mood to appreciate the scenery, so he found an inn to stay. The next day, Shi Quan bought several kinds of sacrificial offerings, took them out of the city, set them up in an open space, and kowtowed to the sky several times. He was offering sacrifices to Marshal Yue and his sons.</p>
<p>While kowtowing, Shi Quan prayed: "Marshal Yue, two young generals, you were loyal in life, and you must become gods after death. Shi Quan came to Lin'an to assassinate the traitor Qin Hui, to eliminate harm for the country, and to avenge Marshal Yue and his sons. May the spirits of Marshal Yue and his sons in heaven bless Shi Quan, and let Shi Quan succeed in this great thing."</p>
<p>After Shi Quan finished praying, he stood up, staring blankly at the sky, and tears flowed down his eyes. He stood for a while, and seemed to remember something, so he quickly wiped away the tears, packed up the sacrificial offerings, and walked along the West Lake, intending to return to the city.</p>
<p>Things were too coincidental. Shi Quan heard people on the road say: "Prime Minister Qin has gone to Lingyin Temple to burn incense, and the procession is very lively!" And more than one person said this. Shi Quan heard this, quickly reached into his waist and felt the sharp knife hidden there. The knife was there! He thought: "This thief deserves to die! I don't need to go back to the city, I will just lie in ambush on the main road in front of Lingyin Temple, and wait for the traitor to return, and when he passes by there, I will kill him with one knife, how satisfying!"</p>
<p>Shi Quan turned around and walked towards Lingyin Temple. After walking not far, he threw the sacrificial offerings in his hand on the open ground to free his hands and feet. Walking to a place not far from Lingyin Temple, there was a bridge. Shi Quan thought: "This is a good place to hide."</p>
<p>So Shi Quan hid under the bridge, waiting for Qin Hui to return.</p>
<p>Originally, Qin Hui had been feeling guilty since he had harmed Marshal Yue and his sons. As soon as he closed his eyes, he saw Marshal Yue and his sons, and he was terribly afraid. He told his wife, Lady Wang, who advised him to go to Lingyin Temple to burn incense and repent. Qin Hui thought it made sense, so he chose this day to go to Lingyin Temple to burn incense.</p>
<p>Inside Lingyin Temple, Qin Hui met a mad monk who spoke sarcastically, scolding Qin Hui coldly and satirically. Since this person was a madman, Qin Hui could not get angry even if he was upset, so he had to keep it in his stomach. After burning incense, he went back to the yamen. Qin Hui was sitting in the sedan chair, still feeling upset.</p>
<p>As they were walking, the guards suddenly saw a person lying under the bridge, so they reported to Qin Hui: "Reporting to the Prime Minister, there is a person hiding under the bridge."</p>
<p>Qin Hui was in a bad mood, and it was a good opportunity to vent his anger on this person, so he said: "It must be a thief, go and catch him." The guards took the order and went to arrest the person.</p>
<p>Shi Quan was lying under the bridge, and when he saw the Prime Minister's procession from afar, he knew that Qin Hui was coming, and the blood in his body immediately boiled. But his heart was very calm, and he held the sharp knife tightly in his hand, waiting for Qin Hui's sedan chair to stop, so that he could jump out and stab this great traitor to death with one knife!</p>
<p>Who knew that Qin Hui's sedan chair stopped, but the guards pounced towards the bridge. Shi Quan knew that things were bad, but he did not want to escape, but instead jumped out, waiting to fight desperately.</p>
<p>Shi Quan fought several rounds with Qin Hui's guards, and injured several people, but he was outnumbered and was finally captured and taken to Qin Hui's sedan chair.</p>
<p>Qin Hui saw Shi Quan's face full of murderous intent, and had to muster his courage to ask: "Who are you, and why are you here to assassinate this official?"</p>
<p>Shi Quan widened his strange eyes and shouted loudly: "Qin Hui, traitor, listen to me, I, your father, do not change my name or surname, I am Shi Quan, a general under Marshal Yue. My brothers followed Marshal Yue and risked their lives on the battlefield, defeating the Jin army greatly. It was a good opportunity to take advantage of the situation to recover lost territory, but you, a traitor, falsely issued an imperial decree, and tricked Marshal Yue and his sons into harming them. Traitor, what benefits have you received from Wushu, to sell out the country and frame the loyal and good like this? You really have no heart. I am here today to kill you, a traitor, to eliminate harm for the country, and to avenge Marshal Yue and his sons. It's a pity that things were not successful, I can only die... Qin Hui, traitor, I cannot tear you to pieces while alive, and I will become an evil ghost after death to capture your soul! Traitor! Traitor!"</p>
<p>Shi Quan's hateful voice was incessant, and his teeth were clenched. Qin Hui was scolded until he was sweating profusely and was ashamed and angry. He said repeatedly: "This is an assassin, take him away and execute him! Take him away and execute him!"</p>
<p>Shi Quan shouted loudly: "Traitor, listen to me! I, your father, am a loyal and righteous man, I cannot let your traitor's knife cut my head!" He also shouted to the sky: "Marshal Yue, two young generals, Shi Quan did not succeed in his mission, I am coming to follow you."</p>
<p>Shi Quan exerted force with both arms, broke free from the guards' hands, jumped up, and jumped towards the bridgehead, crashing his head against it. Sadly, a loyal and righteous man passed away in this way.</p>
<h3>Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723)</h3>
<p>— Wu Bixiong</p>
<p>— The First Person to Know About Microorganisms —</p>
<p>About two hundred and fifty years ago, there was a Dutchman named Antony Leeuwenhoek. He was the first human being to discover a world that people had never experienced before. This world is a group of tens of thousands of different kinds of small organisms, sometimes harming human beings, even causing death, and sometimes benefiting the people, in some parts of the industries that make human beings rich, they are simply indispensable. In terms of the true happiness of mankind, we find that discovering such a world is always more important than discovering a new continent or an ocean with many islands.</p>
<p>Before talking about the career of this pioneer in the microbial world, we might as well take a look at the situation in various aspects of that era: Speaking of the family, the father had supreme authority, and the children in the family only had absolute obedience. You were not allowed to doubt anything. If you dared to defy the taboo and ask your father about some customs, you were not allowed to doubt the question. Then your doubting attitude could get you a real slap in the face, or perhaps be driven out of the family by your father. Society was also the same. You were not allowed to say "no" to traditional beliefs and rituals, you were not allowed to protest, or even doubt, otherwise you would be suspected of blasphemy. At that time, Europeans in general were beginning to sweep away superstition, but those who were doing it did not know how foolish they themselves were! Although science had begun to sprout, the science of that time neglected the basic "experiment" work of science. "Science", after all, is just "experiment", adding precise observation and clear thinking in "experiment"; because of this, various studies have the hope of gradually approaching the truth. However, Tervetus was burned at the stake for disregarding customs and dissecting a corpse without authorization; Galilei suffered long-term imprisonment because he dared to prove that the earth revolved around the sun. They were breaking down superstition on the one hand, and on the other hand, they treated the functions of these efforts to break down superstition in this way! This was the society at that time! This was the science at that time!</p>
<p>In such a world, Leeuwenhoek was born in 1632 in a small town in the Netherlands. He lost his father early and was raised entirely by his mother. He stopped studying at the age of sixteen and went to work as an apprentice for a grocer in a foreign country. During his apprenticeship, he studied tirelessly, and the shop became his school.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-one, he returned to his hometown and opened a grocery store himself. Later, he became the gatekeeper of the local town office. It was at this time that he developed a strange habit of grinding glass. It turned out that he had heard people say: if very pure glass is carefully ground into a lens, using it to look at things will be much larger than what can be seen with the naked eye. The time from twenty-one to forty years old was completely spent on this work. This was the basic work for his discovery of microorganisms. Without this effort, he would not have become the pioneer of the microbial world.</p>
<p>Leeuwenhoek was not naturally intelligent, his temperament was very stubborn, and he received very little education. He only understood Dutch, which was a kind of vulgar language that was despised at that time, and was commonly used by fishermen, shop assistants and workers. The intellectual class spoke Latin, but Leeuwenhoek was completely clueless about it. A Bible written in Dutch was his entire collection of books. This is so noteworthy! It turned out that this kind of "ignorance" was his good fortune; because it isolated him from the unconsciousness of the scholars of that time, what he relied on was his own eyes, his own thoughts, and his own judgment.</p>
<p>Leeuwenhoek did not go to buy ready-made lenses, he felt that it was always better to do it himself. He learned the method of grinding crystal, and his achievements surpassed those of the famous Dutch crystal grinders. The diameter was less than three millimeters, but its smooth and symmetrical appearance was truly worthy of the saying "divine workmanship". Very small things, when placed under it, looked magnified many times, clearly and accurately, which was amazing. As for other metal accessories, he also refined them himself in the furnace. In an environment where he suffered all kinds of cold ridicule and sarcasm from his relatives and friends, he actually created the simplest and most primitive microscope. Now we can buy a high-end microscope for hundreds of dollars, turn the spiral a few times, and observe all kinds of objects under the lens, perhaps without knowing how this device is made. Leeuwenhoek was not like this.</p>
<p>Whenever he had time, he used his lens to observe everything, whether it was the muscle fibers of whales or the fingerprints on his own hands. He could look at a piece of wool or rabbit hair for hours and hours. When he saw a fine hair turned into a thick strip under his lens, he jumped up happily. He carefully dissected the head of a fly; stuck its brain on the fine needle of his microscope, planting and wondering at the same time. He studied the cross-sections of twelve different trees, and observed the inside of plant seeds. He also saw fleas and lice, which simply made him go crazy with joy. In short, Leeuwenhoek was like a puppy, sniffing everything, regardless of good or bad, fragrant or smelly.</p>
<p>Leeuwenhoek's attitude towards research was very rigorous. He never made decisions lightly. He would not write a word or make a drawing before he was sure. He said:</p>
<p>"People who have just used a microscope to look at things, say today that they saw this, and tomorrow say that they saw that, even experienced observers are deceived. I have spent so much time on this kind of observation; but I am working happily, not worrying about those who say 'Why bother so hard? What good is this?' I do not write anything for these people, but only for thinkers who love the truth."</p>
<p>He worked hard in this way for twenty years!</p>
<p>In the second half of the seventeenth century, European pioneers and seers woke up. They no longer believed in Aristotle's theory, nor did they blindly follow the Pope's holy words. Like that Dutch gatekeeper, they did not regard anything as true knowledge unless they had experienced or understood it themselves. In England, several revolutionary scientists organized a secret society to develop new sciences. This group was the later Royal Society, which was famous all over the world. At that time, the members included Robert Boyle, the founder of scientific chemistry, and Isaac Newton, the master of physics. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Review of "A Comprehensive Treatise on Chinese Marriage Law"</h3>
<p>— Liu Man</p>
<p>Written by Zhang Shen, published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>Due to the instinctive demands of human sexual behavior and the natural laws of reproduction, the union of two sexes began in primitive times. At that time, human wisdom was not yet developed, and life was simple. Although there were no grand marriage ceremonies like today, it already had a simple form of marriage, that is, the union of two sexes to live a permanent sexual life together, on the one hand, to adapt to the physiological instinct, and on the other hand, to conform to the natural laws of human reproduction. Later, human life gradually became more complex, and human wisdom gradually developed. The marriage laws that prevailed in the previous ignorant era naturally could not be applied now. In this way, a new form of marriage was hatched from the customs and habits of society and the trajectory of human evolution. Thus, there were marriage laws such as "betrothal is wife, elopement is concubine," and "a woman who媒self-marries is ugly and untrustworthy," and even some people came out to stipulate marriage ceremonies, which were announced by the ruling class for the common people to follow. The establishment of the Six Rites by the Duke of Zhou is the most concrete example. Due to the evolution of the process of human evolution and the constant succession of the times, the marriage laws and forms of this union of two sexes also varied. In modern times, when science is prosperous and culture is developed, the marriage form of these two sexes has also formed its new style, which is completely different from before.</p>
<p>History tells us that the formation of modern marriage systems and laws is indeed not accidental, and has its own origins and evolution. In order to study the trajectory of human evolution, we have to study the origins and evolution of marriage. The book "A Comprehensive Treatise on Chinese Marriage Law" written by Mr. Zhang Shen can help you understand the origins and evolution of marriage systems and laws, and understand the trajectory of human evolution.</p>
<p>This book "A Comprehensive Treatise on Chinese Marriage Law" starts from the social phenomenon of marriage and goes to the legal phenomenon, explaining the system and laws of marriage, the origin and evolution, etc., very clearly. In the introduction, it is divided into five chapters: Chapter 1 Introduction, Chapter 2 Evolution of Marriage System, Chapter 3 Legislation of Marriage, Chapter 4 Nature of Marriage, Chapter 5 Forms and Customs of Marriage. After reading this introduction, we can have a full and clear concept of the concept of marriage and its historical development. Especially in Chapter 5, Forms and Customs of Marriage, the marriage customs of the past are presented to us, such as bigamy and remarriage, consanguineous marriage, affinity marriage, uxorilocal marriage and adoption of child brides, jealousy, concubines, adoption of husbands and pawned wives, early marriage and non-marriage, etc., which enable us to know all the marriage customs and their evolutionary process.</p>
<p>In the main body of the book, it is divided into five chapters according to the title of the Civil Code, and the customs of various marriages are explained and analyzed with reference to the articles in the Civil Code, which is very convenient for readers who do not have legal knowledge. Not only that, but the author also uses the articles of the Investigation Record of Civil and Commercial Customs of the Judicial Administration Department as the main source of narration of marriage customs, and quotes them in each paragraph according to their nature and cause. In this way, the general reader can have something to refer to with the regulations promulgated in law, needless to say, it is very beneficial to the reader.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this book "A Comprehensive Treatise on Chinese Marriage Law" expounds the social phenomenon of the marriage system from the perspective of legal science, so that readers have a clear outline of the nature of marriage and its historical development. Undoubtedly, this is not only helpful for researchers of marriage law, but also for readers of human history.</p>
<h3>"New Book Criticism and Introduction"</h3>
<p>— Dai Yingfu</p>
<p>— Culture Construction, January Issue —</p>
<p>The January issue of the Culture Construction Monthly is a special issue titled "New Book Criticism and Introduction." Half of the content in this issue follows the usual format, while the other half is entirely composed of criticism and introductions of new books. This section includes as many as twenty articles, which can be considered a suitable quantity for a special issue. Now, what we want to do is to provide a general overview of this type of criticism and introduction. However, it is impossible to discuss each of these twenty articles individually in this short space; therefore, we can only pick out a few to talk about.</p>
<p>First, there is "China at the Crossroads" written by Chen Shifu. This book is in English, authored by Zhang Pengyang; it is written specifically for European and American readers. Chen Shifu's introductory text to this book can be described as concise and powerful. He explains the importance of the book at the beginning, and then proceeds to introduce it chapter by chapter. Finally, he extracts the author's conclusion and uses it as his own. The conclusion is as follows:</p>
<p>Luo said:</p>
<p>"I believe that the strength of Western culture is the scientific method, and the strength of Chinese culture is a rational outlook on life. We hope that the Western scientific method and the Chinese rational outlook on life will gradually combine."</p>
<p>The method of introducing the author's conclusion, as Chen does, is the most powerful, as it can give readers an accurate understanding of the original book.</p>
<p>Second, there is "The Powerful America" by Fan Zhongyun. This is also an English book, written by an American, Eugene J. Young. Fan's writing on this book is a combination of introduction and criticism. He explains the special features of this book at the beginning, that is, it contains many unknown stories. Then, he introduces the three most important chapters in the book. Those three chapters are: "Strong and Weak Japan," "Will the Chinese Mainland Be Divided at Will?", and "America Controls the Balance of Power." Fan introduces the chapter on China as follows:</p>
<p>"...However, using Japanese oppression to promote Chinese unity and build up military strength to drive out Japan, then the danger may be even greater than Japan. Therefore, according to the author's intention, it is best if North China can be independent and form its own country, and Japan must not interfere. The three countries, Britain, America, and Japan, will thus reach a compromise. At the same time, he also advocates that South China and Central China should be separated and form their own countries."</p>
<p>Of course, Fan has faithfully introduced the author's argument, but he has not fulfilled his responsibility to provide strict criticism. Such erroneous arguments from an American standpoint should be corrected. True, Fan has expressed his protest in the conclusion; however, this protest is ultimately too weak and does not match the strength of the introductory text.</p>
<p>Third, let's talk about "On International Law, Volume One" by Di Chen. This book is in Chinese, written by Li Shengwu. Di Chen's writing on this book is purely an introduction. His introduction method is very clever. He first explains the fact that the great powers despise international law, and its necessity. Secondly, he proceeds to introduce it chapter by chapter. In conclusion, he says: This book on international law is very good and is a necessary reading for the Chinese people; because China has suffered greatly from the great powers' contempt for international law.</p>
<p>Fourth, there is "The Psychology of Literature and Art" written by Sun Fuxi. Because Sun is an artist himself, he uses the perspective of an artist to explain the importance of this book. This is also a purely introductory text. First, he very uniquely quotes the original author Zhu Guangqian's confession. Secondly, he explains the shortcomings of Chinese art, which has never been based on theory, and then talks about the need for literary and artistic theory. Finally, he uses the following two sentences as a conclusion: "The psychology of literature and art is a recipe for literary and artistic creators and critics. As for its content, we will wait for everyone to read the original book and then look for an opportunity to introduce it." Therefore, this can be said to be a very faithful and powerful introductory text.</p>
<p>Originally, there were two other articles, such as Feng Sanqiu's "Critique of Rural Construction in China" and Wang Fuquan's "A Glimpse of Japanese Research on Chinese Academics," which also needed to be discussed, but due to space limitations, we had to give up. In short, the "New Book Criticism and Introduction" special issue of the Culture Construction Monthly contains extremely serious, faithful, and reliable texts that are definitely not comparable to the advertising texts of bookstores; its benefit to the reading community is of course not to be ignored.</p>
<h3>"Biography of Fabre"</h3>
<p>— Gu Xiong</p>
<p>Authored by G. V. Legros, translated by Lin Yanfang, published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>The insect world is a vast garden that is quite available for us to study; but ordinary people, upon seeing this phenomenon, sigh and say how great nature is, then immediately shake their heads and leave, never exploring its essence, and what they gain is only the knowledge of being able to sigh. Taking this attitude to deal with the world is following the beaten path, vanity; to study knowledge, then it is unlikely to have any remarkable achievements. When we see Fabre's spirit, we will truly feel unusually ashamed. Fabre's nature is "to be thorough in everything. If you study granite, then all the newly emerging questions along the way need to be clarified one by one, and you will not stop until the granite problem is finally solved." Look at how this enthusiastic scientist tirelessly ponders every small action of insects in difficult environments.</p>
<p>Bergson said: "Intuition is necessary to exhaust the source of life." Fabre's life was forever devoted to "intuitively exhausting the source of life." He believed that every action of various insects has meaning. What often makes ordinary people laugh can often arouse the deep thought of sages. The ordinary things we occasionally see on the paths we walk every day, if thoroughly researched, will be like the sun, moon, and stars, and the vast world, generating countless questions. Speaking of which, all things in the universe are a number, and within this number, there are infinite meanings hidden. If we can understand these active numbers and sort out or explore the implied meaning, then even a small, useless piece of land, for a lonely researcher, should not be an unexpectedly good art exhibition hall. Fabre is the one who leads us to this exquisite and frightening art museum.</p>
<p>Darwin was Fabre's enemy in biological theory, one advocating the theory of evolution, the other advocating the theory of instinct, but Darwin said in his letter to him, "Throughout Europe, I don't think anyone admires your research as much as I do." This clearly shows that this scientist was highly praised. Because nature is poetry, he is also called a poet. Indeed, reading his great work, "Souvenirs Entomologiques," is like returning to the poetic hometown: the spring-grieving cuckoo, the butterflies on the grass, the fireflies by the river on summer nights, the forever tearful katydid; these are all objects of poets, and they are also Fabre's objects. It is no accident that he was recommended as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>
<p>The life and deeds of this great French scientist are recorded in this book. The author, Legros, was Fabre's close friend and a keen scholar of science. The draft outline of this book was published before Fabre's death and had a preface by Fabre, which was very complimentary. He said: "The work of writing a biography is to narrate that person's life in an interesting way, and my friend fully understands this purpose, and can reproduce on paper the situations I have observed in the environment over the years, and can explain the methods I have followed, and my thoughts and all my research, and all my inventions, in a succinct and clear way. This work certainly has many difficulties, but he has achieved this masterpiece. The narration is so well-organized that even I can only marvel at it." From this book, we can roughly see this eccentric man who always wears a wide-brimmed hat, trekking in the scorching sun to watch bees courting, and patrolling the work of crickets at night with a lamp. He is a modern "self-taught" scientist who is not afraid of cold or heat and is stubborn (he despises knowledge from books, and only believes it if he has carefully observed it himself and deems it to be correct).</p>
<p>Because he used a popular pen to compile textbooks on animal psychology that are all based on experiments, he started a new trend in French education, so he is also recognized as a great educator. Most of his life was devoted to education for the sake of bread.</p>
<p>In this booklet, the author said that he tried his best to get the protagonist to speak for himself. Fabre's "Souvenirs Entomologiques" often reveals the autobiography of this lonely investigator, and this biography is just to select these fundamental meanings and connect them together.</p>
<p>Reading the biography of such a great scientist, poet, and educator will be a good help both in learning and in self-cultivation.</p>
<p>Fabre's famous work, "Souvenirs Entomologiques," has long been praised by the world, and there are translations in various countries, but not in China. Mr. Lu Xun once wanted to translate it, but unfortunately passed away. I hope someone can take on this task of introduction. What he bestows upon us will surely not be small.</p>

<h3>Improved Year-End Settlement</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The end of the year is difficult to get through. When industry and commerce reach this point, they generally find it difficult to cope. Especially in recent years, due to the sluggish market, operators feel even more miserable. In the past three or four years, many businesses in this city were unable to maintain themselves during the year-end settlement period and declared bankruptcy. This is naturally the impact of the global economic panic.</p>
<p>However, last year's situation was somewhat different. According to the report on the 14th, all industries in this city were able to safely overcome the difficulties. In particular, the financial industry showed a good situation, opening up a situation not seen in five years. The financial panic was most severe two or three years ago. During the year-end settlement period of the 23rd year, several banks and firms were forced to close. By the 24th year, the situation became even more tense, with 14 banks closing and 9 remittance firms going bankrupt. Last year, however, interbank lending rates were relaxed, foreign exchange was stable, the volume of negotiable instruments increased, and the prices of public bonds and securities trended upward, which can be said to be a period of financial stability.</p>
<p>Not only was this the case in Shanghai, but the news on the same day carried reports from various places, such as Fuzhou, Jiading, Changshu, Jiangyin, Changzhou, and Nantong, all reporting good news, saying that the situation in industry and commerce last year had improved. The year-end settlement showed good results in debt collection, and there were many who profited. This phenomenon is gratifying.</p>
<p>There are roughly two reasons for the improved year-end settlement last year. First, agricultural production was abundant in various places, so industry and commerce benefited from it and were revitalized. Second, the government implemented a new currency policy, which stabilized the financial industry.</p>
<p>However, this good situation may be temporary and may not be universal. For example, in Guangdong Province, according to the report on the same day, the economic situation was extremely bad last year, and all industries felt the difference between the past and the present. This is proof of this. In other places, industry and commerce probably remain as distressed as in previous years.</p>
<p>As far as the lives of the general people are concerned, the situation has not only not improved, but has even become more difficult. Because the prices of all goods in the market rose last year, and the degree of consumption increased. However, the rewards for hardworking farmers and workers, and small and medium-sized clerks who rely on salaries, remained the same. This cannot but affect them. Taking daily necessities as an example, firewood and rice were expensive in Shanghai last year, and fish, meat, and vegetables all rose in price. As a result, even if residents lived extremely frugally, they still suffered from the burden.</p>
<p>Comparing the above-mentioned situations, it can be seen that the improvement in industry and commerce last year was only an abnormal phenomenon. Because the revitalization of various industries must wait until the lives of the people are stable. Therefore, in order to hope that the market can become more and more prosperous in the future, it is necessary to find ways to improve the living standards of the people. Otherwise, the so-called improvement may be difficult to sustain.</p>
<h3>Early Spring Night Record</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>When spring comes, everything seems to change.</p>
<p>At night, I walk alone through the lonely street. The spring breeze gently strokes my face. The feeling is the same as usual: spring has begun. I raise my head. The color of the sky is like being painted with a thick layer of dark green oil paint, so moist and so beautiful. The moon is just a small bud, stuck on top, like a white sail floating in the ocean. The Big Dipper shines brightly. It has a scissor-like tail and two pointed wings, like a swallow, flying swiftly. The air is fresh and beautiful, with not a speck of dust mixed in it. From one end of the street, you can see the other end without any obstruction. The street lamps quietly emit light, like a giant eye, watching the growth of all things, and the rainbow-like halo surrounding it smiles slightly.</p>
<p>Every night, I look forward to the arrival of spring, remembering the names of the stars that my mother showed me when I was lying in her arms as a child. Now, it has really come. Sitting on the bed, listening to the drifting bells of the nearby Jesus Church, the footsteps of spring slowly move closer to my window. It gently reaches in with the fingers of the wind and shakes hands with me, saying:</p>
<p>"Spring has come!"</p>
<p>My heart is as happy as lying in my mother's arms.</p>
<p>I like spring, I like the moonlight of spring, and that Big Dipper. Because I am a child of spring, born in the bright spring. However, I have never been close to spring. I grew up in a painful life. However, I look forward to the arrival of spring, just like the words in Pushkin's poem:</p>
<p>"Misfortune's" faithful sister,</p>
<p>Is the "hope" from that dark ground</p>
<p>He encourages courage and joy,</p>
<p>What is coming is the great opportunity.</p>
<p>Every time spring comes, I always remember Eroshanko's prose "Spring and its Power" that I read when I was a child.</p>
<h3>"Old Shanghai"</h3>
<p>— Chun Shen</p>
<p>Just living in Shanghai for a long time does not mean you are an "Old Shanghai," you must be very familiar with everything in Shanghai to be considered an Old Shanghai.</p>
<p>Old Shanghai people don't like to get cheap things, because "cheap" is definitely not good quality. For example, cod liver oil is a seasonal gift now, but cheap, miscellaneous brands of cod liver oil are not refined well and are ineffective. Old Shanghai people will never be fooled.</p>
<p>So when Old Shanghai people buy cod liver oil, they always go to the Wuzhou Pharmacy, because Wuzhou's own brand of milky white cod liver oil is precisely tested with the blue reaction method, and the vitamin content is abundant. Wuzhou's Earth brand malt extract cod liver oil is made with pure turtle cod liver oil and high-quality malt extract, etc. It tastes very sweet and is the most reliable.</p>
<h3>My Sleeping Method</h3>
<p>— Bi Hu</p>
<p>In cold weather, because my limbs are stiff, I often suffer from insomnia, which is very distressing! Later, a friend told me that he taught me to wash my feet with hot water before going to bed, adding a small amount of "Yalin Sand" to the water. This can make the blood flow down, calming the brain and inducing sleep? Second, it can relieve itching and dispel dampness, eliminating athlete's foot; after implementing it according to the law, I really get a good night's sleep every night. And my wife also puts "Yalin Sand" in the water every night when she washes, and she is still very healthy! I think this is the effect of disinfection. So I wrote it out for everyone to use.</p>
<p>"Yalin Sand" is packaged in four types: four-ounce bottles, eight-ounce bottles, one-pound bottles, and two-pound bottles. Two-pound bottles are the most cost-effective. All Wuzhou pharmacies and large pharmacies sell them.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>His passionate words have always inspired my heart. I always find them and read them quietly. But this year, I can't find them. Maybe they were lost in my hometown, or maybe they were squeezed into a corner. But I can't forget Eroshanko, the kind and respectable blind poet, those words that encouraged me year after year...</p>
<p>He said that spring is great and has incomparable power. He said: "Friends, spring lives with us. He dominates our fields and our gardens. He rules everywhere. He is about to pass through people's cold hearts, and he is also going to knock on the doors of souls drowsing in darkness and indifference. He covers our fields with a piece of green velvet blanket; he decorates our gardens with beautiful and fragrant flowers; he makes birds sing love songs, he makes rivers whisper words of hope, he makes the gentle evening breeze bring back his secret and dear dreams to the disappointed heart. He makes us forget all the loneliness of the long and cold winter nights, the betrayals of the cold and dark winter hearts; every walk to the fields and mountains shows us a new world of beauty; every night, at that time, the new moon sends down his warm silver kisses to the tired earth, is a new revelation"!</p>
<p>I have experienced all these words. Time passes quickly. After several springs, I have reached adulthood. After reviewing what he said, I took one of his questions and asked myself. He said: Under these various revelations, in the garden of your heart, "friend, what kind of seeds will you sow in spring"?</p>
<p>What kind of seeds have I planted in the past? Only one kind: let spring always be in my cold heart. But I never got any results. Only one autumn of one year, a friend sowed a seed of truth in my heart, and it grew up in the cultivation of me and my friend. Because of the growth of this seed, I only understood this year that spring can always live in our hearts. At the same time, I can also plant other seeds in my heart. So, what do I plant? There is only one kind that I like, which is figs.</p>
<p>I planted this seed.</p>
<p>I want to work silently, using the strength I have, to make the seeds sprout, grow, and bloom. However, the flowers cannot be seen by others. I don't need them to see them. Let it bloom secretly, wither secretly, and when people don't notice it, I will harvest it with the happy heart of spring, harvesting full, purple, and radiant fruit... That fruit is numerous, full...</p>
<p>It's late at night. The color of the sky is even more lovely. The red and green lights of the neon lights in the city dissolve into the blue of the sky lonely, turning into a micro-purple, like the color of ripe figs, like the color of figs poking out their faces from green leaves...</p>
<p>I closed the book, looked through the glass window, looked at this color, and had unspeakable spring happiness in my heart. The night wind blew in warmly, penetrated into my heart, and warm spring settled in my heart. Let me work silently and harvest my own fruits silently!</p>
<h3>Three Baldy</h3>
<p>— Ma Feng</p>
<p>I haven't seen Three Baldy carrying his candy stall on the street for half a month. I saw him this morning. He is not like he used to be, he has no energy, his smile is gone, his skin is yellow and his face is thin, like someone who crawled out of a grave.</p>
<p>When Aunt Zhang met him, she opened her mouth in surprise.</p>
<p>"Old San, why did you come to the street before you got better? Look at the complexion on your face - it hasn't recovered at all!"</p>
<p>Three Baldy stopped carrying the load, looked at Aunt Zhang, smiled coldly - no, he smiled perfunctorily, shook his head, and said:</p>
<p>"What can I do? I've been sick for almost twenty days! All my money is spent. What can I do if I don't go to the street? Carrying the candy stall around the city can also relax my mind, so I don't have to stay at home and worry for nothing!..."</p>
<p>Aunt Zhang couldn't say anything, and nodded in agreement. Three Baldy turned his head to leave, but Aunt Zhang stopped him.</p>
<p>"I remembered something, Old San, please take the trouble to inquire about the price of rice for us. My man is going to the city tomorrow..."</p>
<p>Three Baldy agreed before she finished speaking! - He knew what Aunt Zhang wanted him to do: to inquire about the market so that she could go to the city to buy.</p>
<p>Three Baldy started walking on the road to the city.</p>
<p>The weather was strangely warm, and Three Baldy was not completely well - he was weak, and he broke out in a sweat as he walked. When he entered the city gate, he saw the police checking people coming and going as if something had happened, and he panicked: he looked uneasily.</p>
<p>"Oh, oh! I don't know what happened again!"</p>
<p>Three Baldy said to himself. He walked, trying his best to calm down: - No matter what it is, it has nothing to do with me! But he hadn't walked a few steps with his load when he was surrounded by four policemen. Three Baldy panicked. When a policeman came up and wanted to grab his arm, he became even more afraid: -</p>
<p>"What's the matter? Oh my, arresting rebels... arresting me..."</p>
<p>Three Baldy's face turned pale with fright. A consciousness drilled into his head, dodged away from the policeman's hand, dropped the load, and ran desperately out of the city. He kept turning his head to look: were they chasing after him? He turned his head to look, turned his head to look - he had to run even harder: red stars and green stars were spinning in front of his eyes; his legs were rising and falling with great effort, as if they were not self-reliant, as if he were stepping on cotton bales. Sweat was streaming down, and the hair that was more than an inch long was all standing up! - The hat was grabbed by the police when he ran out of the city gate.</p>
<p>Five or six policemen were chasing desperately behind Three Baldy, shouting loudly - let the policemen in front intercept him! The police siren rang.</p>
<p>Three Baldy had no way to go: there were people blocking him in front: there were people chasing him from the side! He couldn't find his footing in panic. What he saw in his eyes was a moat. He looked at the opposite bank - and jumped into the moat. The river water was flowing non-stop. He tried his best to swim. He opened his eyes to look: all around was dark, full of people. When Three Baldy was submerged by the river water and tried desperately to struggle to get up, lumps of mud fell into the river - splash splash splash... the river water jumped up... He was exhausted. He did not beat the river water - he sank down.</p>
<p>Three Baldy's body was placed next to the city gate, waiting for the medical officer's inspection. People crowded into an egg to see! Look! This opium addict. People chatted.</p>
<p>The body was examined: the face was smoky... death by drowning.</p>
<p>Three Baldy had no family members, and the body was buried in a public cemetery.</p>
<p>Three Baldy's candy stall can no longer be seen on the street. People in the town all thought he died of illness.</p>
<h3>New Year's Life in the Alleyway of the Abolished Calendar</h3>
<p>— Written by Chen Haoxiong</p>
<h3>Official Style Writing</h3>
<p>— Ye</p>
<p>Official documents going back and forth in officialdom are probably like lawsuits. It seems that only in this way can the dignity of being an official be maintained. So, over time, it has become a fixed pattern. Official documents to superiors must use phrases like "etc. because of this." If phrases like "etc. based on this information" are used, it's not just a joke. Moreover, it is said that the more ambiguous the meaning expressed in the text, the more it demonstrates that one is an experienced document writer.</p>
<p>When ordinary people file lawsuits, besides being "brought in for interrogation," they must first submit a written petition. Now there are "great lawyers." There weren't any in the Qing Dynasty, but there were similar "litigation masters." The petitions were also called "report lists." We can still buy them in the market today, "Four Great Wicked Litigators of Modern Times." Flipping through them, you truly feel that a "major event," once in their hands, immediately turns into nothing, or something is created out of nothing, ultimately causing the other party's family to be ruined and their people to die. In fact, examining their function closely, there are only one or two words, and these one or two words are ambiguous.</p>
<p>This kind of writing used in officialdom, once it reaches the level of the common citizens, its meaning becomes even more extensive. The common people have given it another name, called "official style writing," and its meaning has broadened to include everything that "emphasizes form over substance."</p>
<p>Since "official style writing" is a hypocritical decoration, a black shop selling human flesh buns, and hanging a sheep's head while selling dog meat, then even if the train arrives at the scheduled time, it can still be tens of minutes late. Even if civil servants are not in the office during office hours, and even though the long-distance bus compartment is prominently displaying a sign saying this bus is limited to "thirty-three people," it can still exceed to forty-three people, or even more than forty-three people.</p>
<p>So much official talk is spoken, so much "official style writing" is produced. If China does not get rid of "official style writing" one day, then it will be hanging an empty sign one day.</p>
<p>——How can we remove this sign?</p>
<h3>Miracle</h3>
<p>— Luojia</p>
<p>I read a telegram in this newspaper, the date of which I cannot remember. The content of the telegram was: The World Catholic Congress held Children's Day today. A Filipino elementary school student named Fan Jiala crawled four hundred yards to the altar of the Congress and prostrated himself to pray. It was announced to the public that he lost his voice due to illness at the age of six and could not speak, and the doctors were helpless. Last year, he silently prayed to God, seeking help and vowing to be a devout believer in God for life. By the end of the year, he could gradually speak. The child then firmly stated: "I believe this must be God's work. God gave me my life first and restored my voice. I will wholeheartedly dedicate myself to God." Everyone was amazed and considered it a miracle.</p>
<p>This is naturally a "miracle." When I read "firmly stated," it was as if that mute Filipino elementary school student was actually reciting the "Gospel of Matthew" loudly in my ear. However, I happened to have a medical magazine on hand, with clinical experiences of famous doctors appended at the end. There was also a similar "miracle" in it, but the person who helped that unfortunate mute who "lost his voice due to illness" "gradually speak" was not "God," but a famous Japanese doctor. According to the record, the vocal cords were in a state of constriction, thus causing "loss of voice." It is now unknown to what extent that Filipino elementary school student "lost his voice"; but since it is said that he lost his voice due to illness and could not speak, it can be confirmed that he "had not yet become completely mute." When we were studying basic physiology in middle school, we already knew that pronunciation relies on the vibration of the vocal cords, like the sound track of a sound film. If something goes wrong with the vocal cords, then naturally one "cannot speak." However, the difference between the constricted state of the vocal cords and a true mute, as I am not a famous doctor, nor God, I am not in a position to make reckless judgments. That Filipino elementary school student's ability to "restore my voice" probably belongs to the former condition. The so-called "doctors were helpless" is just that those "generous" quack doctors recorded the credit on God's account.</p>
<p>However, to put it another way, I am not opposed to freedom of religion here. It is everyone's freedom for Chinese people to believe in Bodhisattvas and for that Filipino elementary school student to vow to wholeheartedly dedicate himself to God, but in the era of scientific enlightenment in the twentieth century, when medicine has already invented the use of X-rays to illuminate various diseases, asking Bodhisattvas for elixirs or silently praying to God is taking life too lightly.</p>
<p>"Every prayer is answered" and "miracles" are both promotional items, and all religious promotional items are even more "miracles" among "miracles."</p>

<p>Zhongxi (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Spring Chamber Complaint"</p>
<p>Curved railings, curved walls. Winding and twisting around the corridor. Walking back and forth through fragrant paths. A gust of wind comes, a burst of fragrance. Butterflies flutter. Swallows fly. Branches and leaves cast shadows on the weeping willows. But behold, the peach blossoms are bright as brocade. Willow catkins flutter wildly. And listen, the iron horses clang and the wind sounds. Orioles sing sweetly like drums and sheng flutes. The curtain hooks are not seen rolled up heavily. The lingering fragrance of Han Shou's incense from the burner. Thinking of me, muddleheaded and lingering with old hatred. Weary and lazy to embroider mandarin ducks. Jade comb does not smooth silken hair. Treasured mirror lavishly applies light makeup. All day long, sitting alone in the boudoir, the sound is silent. Aroused, I lie listlessly on the bed. Then call, add burning fire to the furnace. The maidservant busily decocts medicine. But hearing, the wind and rain patter sadly outside the window. The fox lamp is dim, the night is long with sorrow. I cannot help but think about right and wrong in my heart. Whispering to myself, secretly pondering. I remember, I and you had an appointment before. I only hoped to accompany my Xiao Lang morning and evening. Unexpectedly, a storm arose in the vast sea of love. Leaving me, alone and lonely, guarding the empty room. My intestines are broken inch by inch. Thinking and missing him, tears streaming down my face. From now on, the road is long and I cannot hope for news. Blood and tears stain my face, crying until I break. I feel bitter rain and loneliness. Sad wind rustles, forming bleakness. Only the lamp remains, dimly shedding red beans. Quietly, the gauze curtains are dim and without light. Alas, I hate my fleeting life. Tears soak through my silk clothes. Look, the green grass in the courtyard is green year after year. I only hate that strands of love cannot be tied for long. My dream soul vaguely matures as millet.</p>

<p>The beauty of Xiaoxiang's concubine is unparalleled. Hearing, the parrot reciting poetry wants to break its heart. Golden wind blows down autumn paulownia leaves. Her slender body feels the evening coolness. Stop the embroidery thread. Close the gauze window. Having bathed in the orchid chamber, she arranges her remaining makeup. Lightly applies snail ink to her green eyebrows. Lightly dyes rouge on her fragrant skin. Jade threads obliquely comb her greasy hair. Faded red shirt reveals her fragrant skin. Standing quietly on the jade steps, speechless. Gently waving a fan against the setting sun. The golden crow gradually sets in the western mountains. The moon rises on the treetops, reflecting the silver wall. Turning and twisting, she pities her beautiful shadow. Softly calling Xueyan to light the silver lamp. Ziju, a maidservant, asks her mistress. Why do you always sigh and shed tears? A heart full of secrets, no one knows. For whom do you become thin and lose your beauty? Helplessly, the night is long. Loosening her silk clothes, she goes to bed. Hearing, the rain beats on the banana leaves, wetting the crabapples.</p>

<h3>Random Notes on "Elastic Daughter"</h3>
<p>In "Elastic Daughter," there are three dancers with different personalities. One is Fang Lizhu. She is a sophisticated young woman who has been disappointed in love several times. She believes that love is terrible. She is a hedonist.</p>
<p>One is Hu Xuehua. Her personality is eccentric. She does not quite understand the true meaning of love. She only hopes that she can get a comfortable home. These two roles are guest-starred by Yan Yuexian and Zhu Qiuhen, with excellent results.</p>
<p>The other is Mo Meipeng. She is oppressed by the burdens of life and has to engage in the dancer's life. She always wants to get rid of this bad environment, but she never fulfills her long-cherished wish. This role is played by Lu Ming.</p>
<h3>Assorted Notes on "Mr. Wang's Profitable Ways"</h3>
<p>Mrs. Wang, Sang Shuzhen, who is short and terribly fat, and Mrs. Chen, Zhai Qiqi, who is thin and terribly tall, along with Miss A Yuan, Li Lin, who is young and beautiful, perform the folk dance "Beating the Lotus Palms" in "Mr. Wang's Profitable Ways."</p>
<p>Qin Shi Huang sought the elixir of immortality but did not succeed. However, modern science invented the "rejuvenation" thing in "Mr. Wang's Profitable Ways." Clearly, an old woman with wrinkled skin and white hair can actually turn into a young and beautiful girl, and a big dog can actually turn into a small dog, which is quite interesting.</p>
<h3>A Scene from "Streamlined Love"</h3>
<h3>Newsreel of "Crossroads"</h3>
<p>"Crossroads" is a work that depicts the suffering of unemployment using six educated youths as the warp and woof. The subject matter is very realistic and vivid.</p>
<p>Here, six different personalities and different developments are portrayed, forming a story of young people that is commonly found in this current society.</p>
<p>These six different characters are played by Zhao Dan, Ying Yin, and new talents Bai Yang, Lü Ban, Sha Meng, and Yi Ming. In the selection of characters, Shen Xiling had spent a lot of thought in advance.</p>
<p>Although "Crossroads" is a tragedy, the whole play is handled entirely with a comedic approach, which is very light and lively, and quite able to cater to the tastes of the general audience.</p>
<p>Wu Yin and You Guangzhao, two large fat people, play a poor unemployed couple here. Old You sings Peking opera and drinks yellow wine, and the performance is quite funny.</p>
