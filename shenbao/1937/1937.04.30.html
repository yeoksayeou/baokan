<p>時評</p>
<h3>滇緬南段勘界工作的完成</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>懸宕三十餘年的滇緬南段未定界。現經中英共同勘界委員會會勘完畢。最後報告書已在緬甸桑格郎簽字。等到兩國政府正式核准。就可為立界樁。確定這方面重要的邊界。關於會勘的結果。還未獲得詳報。據國民社電訊。雙方所爭執的邊境領土約有五分之三。經勘界委員會中立委員長瑞士人愛斯林的仲裁。劃歸中國。礦愈豐富的班洪猛等四飚。都在其內。而英方當初所堅持的所謂斯各脫紅綫（載在一八九七年滇緬界務專約）則已經完全推翻。這樣的解决。對於我國大體上是有利的。</p>
<p>放開了地理的問題來說。這次會勘工作的告成也值得我們非常的慶幸因為國境未定界的存在妨碍着邊政的推進和國防的布置實在是獨立國家莫大的恥辱。在民族復興的途徑上。這恥辱是必須消滅的。滇緬的未定界。因我國的積弱。懸宕到三十餘年。三牟前。英國武裝探險隊與班洪民衆發生了衝突。我政府才向英政府建議。會勘南段邊界。二十四年四月中英兩國經過了換文的手續組織共同勘界委員會由中英政府各推委員兩人國際行政院主席選派中立委員一人為委員長。當年十一月底。五委員率同工作人員在戶算集合。開始會勘。會勘工作以一八九七年舊約為依據。先就天然條件如分水嶺紅緯度及山川地名。暫定一虛擬的界綫。作為條約綫。每逢這條虛擬綫跟政治區域的界限相抵觸。就由雙方舉出人體物證來。把這綫修改。由中立委員長作最後的决定。這個辦法不能不說相當的公允。現在我們西南邊境那一段未定的界綫已經用這公允的辦法勘定了。這對於我國西南的邊政和國防。不消說是有莫大的利益的。我們應該感謝五委員及全體工作人員兩年來心身的勞苦。尤其應該感謝英國政府在這次會勘中表現得很顯明的好意。</p>
<p>還有。我們不能忘却的是邊區民衆對於這次勘界工作的助力。我們知道。要是班洪民衆不反搞外國武力的侵入。勘界問題也許到現在還不見得會提起。在勘界期間。就地居民的意向又是决定領土主權誰屬的要素。勘界委員會所注意的人體就在此。近數十年來。西洋教會的勢力雖已深入了滇邊的村寨。而邊地落後的士民始終不忘情於祖國。上月間猛梭的士民甚至用縹牛盛典熱烈地歡迎我方的委員。這等情形是很可慰的。中央及地方當局從此倘能重視邊民的福利把邊區的文化加意開發起來那麼邊民就可成為國防綫上重要的力量了。</p>
<p>滇緬的未定界現在所勘定的只是南段。還有更重要的在片馬方面的所謂北段未定界。在中央兩國親善的精神之下。不久當然也會有勘定的可能。我們西南的國境綫含糊了幾十年。現在開始要弄個清楚了。從此不由得聯想起東北的國境綫來。從國際正義的觀點。這是十分明確的。但是從政治的觀點。可不是已經非常模糊了麼。我們决不能忍受這一種現象。我們必煩大家努力。使模糊的回復到本來的明確。</p>
<h3>日本總選舉今日舉行投票</h3>
<p>政黨與政府鬥爭　受全民公開裁判</p>
<p>［東京］過去四星期、日本政黨與政府間之鬥爭、將於明日受全國民衆之公開裁判、直接參加鬥爭之各方面、現正屏息靜觀總選之結果、同時民衆對明日投票之態度、極為沉默、預料放棄投票權之人民、其數目將較以往任何選舉為大、政府對選舉運動之嚴厲壓迫、使民衆畏懼懲罰、因此許多人民决定放棄投票權、此外民衆普通感覺、卽使新衆議院選舉成立、政府不但不因大多數之反對而辭職、甚且有可能命令衆院再度之解散、職是之故、民衆平常之熱誠大為低落、各大政黨之總部、已通令全國所屬各支部、飭令準備作最從之進攻、政府方面、預料民政黨在議會最大政黨之地位、將大約以十數票之差讓與政友會、惟政民兩黨之合作、旣異常密切、誰為第一黨之問題、對彼等反政府之聯合陣綫毫無影響也、此次政民兩黨對提出候選人甚為謹慎、因此在選出後、受政府勸誘加入新政黨者、雖有其人、但為數不致甚多、社會大衆黨已决定反對政府、在另一方面、政府及半政府派之昭和會與國民同盟所獲之席數則將减少、但是政府自始則不顧慮目前之選舉、足以動搖其地位、因此毅然决然减少選舉之重要、性選舉唯一之意義、現時不過為證明大多數人民是否反對政府而巳、林內閣現遭遇民衆極大之反抗其繼續行政、毫無疑異、增強潛伏之危機、雖然在特別議會召集前而再度解散議會不違反憲法、但事實上不致如此、據聞內閣內部對此問題之意見、頗為紛歧、最後决定之關鍵操諸陸海兩相、是故特別議會之召集、不在如前所規定之七月中旬、而將在八月間舉行、俾予政府以較充分時日擬定其對策也、顯然二次解散議會與修正選舉法之兩問題間、現似有不可分離之連擊、因為後者如不成功、卽使舉行第三第四次之總選、議會局勢亦難有所更變、惟實行修正選舉法、使之對政府有利、必須獲得天皇之緊急詔書、其中障碍甚多、樞密院之可能反對、乃其中之一也、（中央社二十九日電）</p>

<p>蕯拉蒙加　此間國民軍今日發表公報宣稱、據巴斯克俘虜言、當國民軍距古爾尼卡九哩時、巴斯克政府軍卽將該城完全摧毀、國民軍從未以該城為軍事目的、吾軍之飛機、僅轟擊戰綫後之軍事建築與工業區域、加以近數日來濃霧蔽空、天氣惡劣、飛機不能飛行、故古爾尼卡之殘破、不能歸咎於國民軍云、（中央社二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>維多利亞　國民軍司令部頃發表文告、對於外傳古爾尼卡城被國民軍飛機轟炸後起火焚燒之說、加以否認、並謂、新西班牙之統帥、對於巴斯克邦傳統的自由權利、始終加以尊重、巴斯克邦人民乎、其速棄械歸降、並將蓄意摧毀汝等之罪魁、加以逐走云、（中央社二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>比爾波　巴斯克古都古爾尼卡城與埃巴鎮被燬事、國民軍方面謂係政府軍自行焚燬、與國民軍無關、今日巴斯政府主席阿基爾博士特發一文、斥為慌言、並曰、余憑上帝明證、德人飛機轟擊此古都中未設防之平民歷三時半之久、以其空前之野蠶行為、將此古都炸成平地、並用機關槍迫擊婦孺、致死亡纍纍、慘不忍睹、餘者駭極狂奔以避之云（中央社二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於西班牙巴斯克邦古爾尼卡城被轟炸一車、該國共和政府頃發出文告稱、係由於意德兩國參謀團發縱指使、此在國民軍方面、則亦發出文告、對於國民軍飛機投彈轟炸之說、堅决否認、英國政界人士聞訊、頗以為異、但以為雙方文告、未必互相矛盾云、標準晚報載稱、“古爾尼卡城乃係巴斯克邦古都、茲被轟炸、其情形之慘酷、實為西班牙內戰開始以來所未見、吾人所欲知者、卽此事責任應由何方負之是也”云、（中央社二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］外傳西班牙國民軍轟擊古爾尼卡事、與德國有關、此間堅决否認、稱该古城之被毁滅、婦孺數百人之受屠戮、並無德人或德國飛機參加是役、德發言人並稱、該古城之被燬滅、無論何人、均為惋惜、但德國實未參與其事云、查德國當局此次聲辯、係因西班牙巴斯克自由邦主席阿基爾曾發表宣言、謂古爾尼卡之轟炸、係國民軍中德籍機師之所為云、（中央社二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>［柏林］關於巴斯克自治邦總統阿基爾博士、指責德國空軍助桀為虐、轟炸歷史上有名之古爾卡尼城一節、德報對此極表憤慨、稱布爾雪維克惡意宣傳之方法、又復故伎重施、而全世界報紙、何竟受共紿、而對德國加以攻擊耶、繼稱、英國左派報紙故意淆亂聽聞、非特反抗弗蘭哥、且亦直接反對德國云、（二十九日國民海通電）</p>

<p>談言快一點  亦人　　“天下未亂蜀先亂，天下已平蜀未平”的四川，雖然它另外有個美稱，呌做“天富之國”，但活在這個“天富之國”裏的平民，過的日子實在並不美好，捐稅徵到民國六十幾年，那已經是前幾年的傳聞了。最近，則在報上看到，又在鬧着極嚴重的旱災，據本報二十六日專電：、“四川自罹旱災以來，一般貧民，無法維生，羣掘白泥草根以果腹，因而發生不能排洩，脚腫等症而斃命者甚多，兼之春瘟流行，無法醫治而斃命者，更復不計其數，凡此慘象，以川東川北為最甚。據調查所得：重災縣份，每日死亡二百人左右；輕災縣紛，亦日死百餘人；卽以重慶市而論，每日死亡在三十人左右。災象奇重，可謂壓年所未有。”　　也不僅是四川，其他如甘肅，河南，也在鬧著極大的災荒。某報二十五日開封專電：“豫西鞏縣旱災慘重，有李某一家十餘口均餓斃，李亦自縊而死，實為人間一大慘劇。”甘肅則災區達三十四縣之廣。在這廣大的土地上，我們不敢想每日有多少想像不到的慘劇在扮演着。　　兵禍，災荒，和疫厲，那是三位一體的。在科學昌明的二十世紀，天災和由天災而起的大疫，我們知道，如果不是戰亂相尋，防患得宜，原可消弭於無形；卽使有歉收等情，如果早有預防，則卽使米麥的滋味嘗不到，以“本無絲毫營養力，祇是填塞空虛的胃部”的“白泥”，作為“甘之如飴”的糧食的慘劇總不會有的！　　然而現在則不僅災民們以“白泥”來“强遏飢火，飲鴆止渴，”並且還有以爭奪白泥而起的械鬥發生。他們好像活在原始的社會裏，他們的生存就單靠自己的雙手來和天災搏鬥。災區以外的組織和人羣，好像和他們活在兩個世界上似的，就不說責任了，連人類的憐憫心都沒有。　　雖然也有應時而起的救災聲，但那是些什麼呢？是“定本週內召集關係部會開會商討具體救濟辦法：”是“電令受災各縣限卽速將受災情形，詳查具報；”是“詳商賬務事宜，業已就緒，聞將飛甘省視察災情。”　　災荒何以會造成，並且是何以會這樣的一發不可收拾？在現在我們不遑追究。然而，在災荒旣已造成，災民們每天在成批的死去的現在，難道就連“救災如救火”這句谷語都不知道嗎？“商討肯體救濟辦法，”“詳查具報，”“視察災情，”這難道就能夠立刻填飽了災民們的肚皮？這些官樣文章難道能使災民們多活幾天嗎？　　一切“官樣文章”請放到以後再做，現在，先决问題是“快一點！”災民們已經剩最後一息了！村夜曲  王仁東　　夜了：鄉村的夜是浸在寒潭裏的秋月底影子。　　今夜沒有月色，只有疎疎的星點，明閃的星點，露在黝黑的天空裏，當涼風掠過的時候，搖搖不定的閃動，幾乎是要落下來了。遠樹只是一叢鬼影——曾長在聽過說鬼的孩子底腦裏、　　稻斱底一角，被北瓜的莖葉所蔓延而遮沒了：因為籬笆負不起牠們，所以被壓到牠們的身下。牠們的一些，已緣着近旁的茅屋爬上去，爬到屋脊上，爬滿了；把那矮矮的屋子又圍成了一片黑影。　　從門前的水塘裏，偶爾飛來一兩只一映一映的碧色的螢火虫，在瓜葉上低掠過去；一映一映地那活介一隻夜游神的眼睛。牠和那天空里的星點，水面的星點底倒影，還和那幾里路外的燈塔，這些都是夜的詩人的心血的詩句，也是黑暗裏的光明的希望的憧憬。　　瓜籐下傳來的紡織娘的歌聲，還有遠處的不知名的草虫底歌聲，短促的連續的織成一片村夜的合奏曲。當那合奏曲像潮水起伏的時候，夜底一切都隨着起伏了。但在階前偶爾還有一兩聲短促的藥葫蘆的嗚聲，在㘗㘗，㘗㘗地像一串寂寞的慘笑。——這卻不會給那高聲的合奏曲所掩抹掉。　　雖然還傳來了閣閣的蛙聲，然而和清脆的鐘聲雜亂了。我燃了一枝粗大的紅臘，讓牠靠近窗子站住：牠把那窗格的影子，放大了輻射的倒映到戶外去了。我相信在幾里外被人看見了，是會把這搖顫的燭熖，當作鬼火呢。但我也曉得在這時，沒有醒着的人了.屋外的蛾子，急亂的像小雨似的打向玻璃窗上。有的已從門外飛進來撲向燭熖裏。我抬起頭來望着在那血紅的燭油裏，已睡着四五隻青色的蛾子：或者那黑色的一點，也是牠們的屍體的焦灰呢。　　家人的鼾聲在沉寂裏拉長的顫響着，燭熖被風搖得綠了，牠把那屋角的黑影帶着像魔鬼一樣的舞蹈着。　　隣近的狗在吠着，我急忙地把窗簾拉攏；再掩上了房門，握一支筆在手裏，我想寫一些村夜的情緒，然而我却不能寫出來；我曉得，那虫聲的合奏曲，起伏無窮的已在寫着我心間的幻想和情緒了………　　我沉默的凝神的坐着，一些也不動。　　当夜風在蕭蕭的掠過時，合奏曲的聲調暫被抑低了；這是遠遠的有一隻山烏龜在嗚着，像孩子吹廬管似的鳴——鳴的嗚着。紐約世界博覽會的新建築  特　　一九三九年紐約將舉行世界博覽會，那會塲的建築，曾由會務總裁輝倫氏精心擘畫，希望在建築史上別開生面，吸引全世界各處到會參觀者數百萬人的注意。他現在已把會塲中央名呌ThemeCenrre一部的圖案公布，這是全會最精美的部分，預備用兩種奇特壯觀的建築物，點綴其中，要使會塲中萬衆的。目光，全集在這兩項建築物上。一種是高二百呎的精圓白球，好像用噴出的泉水支持著。一種是高七百呎的三角尖柱。到了夜裏，那圓球便大放光明，該會的工程師正在聚精蒼神，要使它的光力之大，為從來所未有。他們預備在遠處房屋上裝置無數强大的發光電池，發出萬道各色的電光，射在球上。同時再用其他射光器，射光罩在那顏色的電光上，使那光芒變移，像雲彩一般，蕩漾在球的四周，因此在參觀者的目光中；那球好像在徐徐地轉動。那球的距地面十八層樓之高，除去那三角尖柱之外，要算會塲中最高的建築物。在距地五十呎的高處，球的一面，開一個入口，用玻璃製成的自動梯，升到那裏，參觀者在步入球的當兒，好像自身懸在半空中，他在這時，立在一個轉動的臺上，可以看見現代文明合作中各種重要任務的偉大景象。球內陳列的，是博覽會各種論文。那球有一橋，通至三角尖柱，那三角尖柱下面，有長九百呎的斜坡，漸漸地傾向地面，彎繞球下噴水池，那池佔一大圓圈的四分之三。那斜坡頂上，高五十呎，參觀者在那裏可以看見會塲的全景。下了斜坡，參觀者可以遙見湖面精瑩的閃光，跟娛樂區燦爛悅目的點綴。附近由Theme　Plaza伸出的各大道，列樹成蔭，蒼翠奪巨。三角尖柱，將為隨時廣播音樂和會塲消息的總匯，上面裝置新式長距離的放聲器，內有數種，還在試騐中，要使全塲很清楚地聽到它所發出的聲浪，不被雜聲摻和。　　會務總裁輝倫曾宣布Theme　Centre的計畫，據他說道：我們要在會塲建築上貢獻點新建築給世界的參觀者。我們相信建築師在這種計畫中已完全表示博鑒會的精神。那球是一種鋼料合成的，它那經緯的梁柱，在下面是重而且大的，向上却漸漸地輕小。球的外面，全塗白質，目下正在試騐用什麼質料，最為適宜。那球的外形，在技術工程上，可稱完全渾圓。就球面平勻的應力跟壓力估計，這樣的大球，在學理上只能用半吋到一吋厚的鏂版製成，只在頂底兩處用夾層。那球除去展覽的物品，重約五百七十六萬磅。在直徑八十一呎的圓</p>
<p>Page 16</p>
<p>周，用八個柱子分開支持着。每柱高十二吋，四厚吋，用圓套包着。參觀者不能看見這些柱子，只看見一個大圓球浮在一叢噴岀的泉水上，因為那柱的周圍，都嵌着玻璃，裏面有水噴岀，把柱身掩蔽。據著名顧問工程師的意見，這種建築，定能安全可靠，大可表示科學設計的進步，跟使用現代工程方法的可能性。球内的空氣流通，跟燈火佈置，也都須煞費苦心，參用新法。那三角尖柱，是從池的東濱升起，也是一個鋼架，外部能够發光。它有三角形的基礎，每面長六十八呎，三面又都是三角形的，升入空中，高約七百呎。三面之一或將為有色的，使由遠處看上去，可知它的深度。柱的基礎上有兩架自動梯，能升高六十五呎，到球的入口處。這是世界上最長的自動梯，每架能載雙排觀衆，估計每小時至多能載送一萬六千人。這兩種建築的形式，雖在幾何學上，是極簡單，極根本的，但在正式建築上，還没有人用過。主持會務的人員，因為在設計上，力求標新立奇，所以决定建造來為全會建築的鎖鑰。造費約美金一百二十萬元，本年五月間便要開始基礎的初步工程。　　會塲的面積，佔一千二百十六英畝半，全部經費，共須美金一萬二千五百萬元。其中的陳列品跟各種娱樂，都有大規模的計畫，每天能容觀衆八十萬人。豫料將來每天的觀衆，平均可達二十五萬人。　　會塲直接工作的人員，共約三萬五千人，間接工作的，還有十五萬人以上。會塲附近的廣塲，能停汽車三千五百輛，會塲四周，建有許多營帳，以便多數遊客在内長住。這些臨時城市，凡現代的各種便利，如溝渠，電燈，自來水，跟飲食店，都應有盡有，羅斯福總統已邀請五十九國參加這會，現在答應參加的，已有三十七國，豫料這會將來開幕後，定為國際博覧會歷史上最偉大的一個。</p>

<h3>Liu Shangqing Discusses Governing Anhui Policy</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The newly appointed Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, Liu Shangqing, arrived in Nanjing yesterday. When a reporter visited him on the 29th to inquire about his policy for governing Anhui, he said, "I have been ordered to govern Anhui, and I am deeply concerned about failing to meet expectations. However, I have repeatedly declined the appointment, but without success, so I have no choice but to reluctantly accept it. I have heard that the local bandits in Anhui Province have not been pacified, and the people are suffering. In my opinion, we should start by suppressing the bandits, while at the same time paying attention to the suffering of the people. Generally speaking, the general public in our country hopes for passive stability and a prosperous life in the current stage of politics, which is better than actively enjoying welfare. If the local area can be stabilized, all political measures will be easily accomplished. Now the central government attaches great importance to national economic construction. After I take office, I will only adhere to the central government's intentions and take into account the local situation. I must especially promote rural production enterprises to meet the current needs. As for other political matters, I will determine the implementation plan after observing the actual situation. Since I entered politics, I have always believed that governing is not about talking too much. It is better to be practical and realistic than to make empty talk. As for the use of personnel, I should only seek out the virtuous, regardless of background. I hope that the virtuous talents of this era will not abandon me and will correct me at any time. I especially hope for this." (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>

He took the Pingpu train north at 4:20 PM. There are many rumors about the Cangshi Railway issue. It is reported that the North China authorities advocate building the Jinshi line, while the Ministry of Railways believes that the Jinshi line is absolutely unnecessary to build. Even from an economic point of view, it is parallel to the northern section of the Jinpu line, which also violates the principle of railway construction. Moreover, a large section of the Cangshi railway bed has already been built, which should also be utilized, saving both time and money. Therefore, it firmly advocates that only the Cangshi line can be built, and it must be managed by the Ministry. It has repeatedly expressed its serious views to the North China authorities.

<h3>Gu Zhutong Appeals for Guizhou Relief</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Guizhou Province is suffering from a severe drought, affecting more than 50 counties. Disaster victims are clamoring for food. Gu Zhutong telegraphed Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs, asking him to appeal to the Ministry of Finance for relief funds. The original telegram is recorded as follows: (Omissions omitted) "With the utmost respect, Guizhou Province suffered from a fall drought last year and a spring famine this year. Rivers are dry and wells are exhausted. Not only is the land cracking and irrigation difficult, but the people are also unable to obtain food every day. The spring harvest has already been lost, and there is still no way to plant the main crop. The people are terrified, which is unprecedented in decades. I have already issued orders to investigate the surplus grain stored in warehouses by wealthy households, ordered them to sell it, and strictly prohibited unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and profiteering, as well as soldiers and civilians from intercepting and selling forcibly along the way. At the same time, I telegraphed the Commander-in-Chief of the Headquarters to purchase and transport a large amount of rice from outside the province to relieve the military and civilian food shortages in order to alleviate the rice famine. I also telegraphed Chairman Chiang and the Disaster Relief Committee of the Executive Yuan to transfer 2 million yuan in relief funds to be used for relief. Now, the disaster-stricken areas have been reported, including Zunyi, Tongzi, Renhuai, Chishui, Guiyang, Anshun, Pingyue, Xifeng, Anlong, and Meitan, Xingyi, Xingren, Guanling, Puan, Majiang, An'nan, Bijie, Qianning, Pingba, Puding, Langdai, Qingzhen, Zhenfeng, Ying'shun, Suiyang, Kaiyang, Zheng'an, Xi'shui, Zhenning, Zhijin, Xiujiao, Shiqian, Ceting, Yanhe, Zhenyuan, Guiding, Dingfan, Huangping, Zhenshan, Dading, Duyou, Bazhai, Qianxi Sanhe, Datang, Yinjiang, Longli, Dejiang, Weng'an, Cengong, Pingzhou, Shibing, Yuqing, Sansui, Luodian, Jiangkou, Songtao, and other counties. Among them, the disaster is most severe and urgent relief is needed, including Zunyi, Tongzi, Renhuai, Chishui, and other more than 20 counties. It is planned to investigate and distribute emergency relief according to the method of emergency relief, dividing them into different levels, with each county receiving 30,000 to 8,000 yuan, and send personnel to investigate and distribute the funds. On the one hand, we will handle agricultural and labor relief. For agricultural relief, we will distribute seeds to save the autumn harvest. For labor relief, we will open tributaries and dredge ditches in the affected counties along the Wujiang River, Panjiang River, and Qingshui River. In areas lacking water sources, we will also dig wells and ponds to supplement irrigation. The above emergency relief requires approximately 500,000 yuan in cash, and rural areas require approximately 400,000 yuan in cash. The labor relief project can not only alleviate the current disaster but also prevent permanent drought, so that it conforms to the purpose of disaster relief and thorough relief. However, the labor relief is huge, and no matter how tight it is, it cannot be done without more than 1 million yuan in cash. In total, the three relief projects require a total of 2 million yuan in cash. We have already formulated detailed plans with detailed items and sent them to the Executive Yuan. However, the Ministry of Finance allocated only 100,000 yuan (on the 23rd) to distribute emergency relief to the most severely affected counties. The difference is still huge, and agricultural and labor relief have no hope of implementation. The disaster is severe, and relief is urgent. In addition to telegraphedly requesting the Executive Yuan to allocate funds according to the number, we also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to temporarily allocate 1 million yuan in relief funds to facilitate early commencement and save the desperate lives in the disaster area. I urge you to vigorously preside over and appeal to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds as soon as possible and to coordinate the purchase and transportation of military rice to avoid affecting civilian food supplies. I deeply pray and still ask for instructions, etc." (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>Statistics on the Area of Wasteland in the Country</h3>

<h3>Gansu Appeal Relief Group Arrives in Xi'an</h3>
<p>[Xi'an] The counties in Hexi, Gansu, have suffered from frequent disasters over the years, and the vitality of the people has been almost exhausted. This year, public security has been restored, but the people are displaced and have no means of livelihood. In addition, they are unable to plant in the spring, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. The misery is beyond comparison. Although the central government has been concerned about the disaster victims and has allocated funds to carry out emergency relief, the disaster area is vast and it is difficult to provide adequate relief. Therefore, local people have publicly elected Tang Fake and 11 others to form an appeal relief group, which came from eastern Gansu and has now arrived in Shaanxi. After visiting Director Gu to report on the disaster situation and request relief, they will go to Nanjing to appeal to the central authorities and to Shanghai to appeal to charitable groups for relief.

<h3>The Completion of Demarcation Work on the Southern Section of the Yunnan-Burma Border</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The undefined southern section of the Yunnan-Burma border, which had been pending for more than thirty years, has now been surveyed and demarcated by the joint Sino-British Boundary Commission. The final report has been signed in Sangkerawng, Burma. Once formally approved by the governments of both countries, boundary markers can be erected to establish the important border in this area. Detailed reports of the survey results have not yet been received. According to a dispatch from the Kuomin News Agency, approximately three-fifths of the disputed border territory has been awarded to China through the arbitration of the neutral chairman of the Boundary Commission, Swiss national Iselin. This includes the four Mengs, including the mineral-rich Pan Hong, while the so-called Scott Line (recorded in the 1897 Yunnan-Burma Boundary Treaty), initially insisted upon by the British side, has been completely overturned. This resolution is generally beneficial to our country.</p>
<p>Putting aside geographical issues, the completion of this survey work is also a cause for great rejoicing, as the existence of an undefined national border hinders the promotion of border administration and the deployment of national defense, which is a great disgrace for an independent nation. On the path to national rejuvenation, this disgrace must be eliminated. The undefined Yunnan-Burma border had been pending for more than thirty years due to China's weakness. Three years ago, a British armed exploration team clashed with the people of Pan Hong, and the government proposed to the British government that the southern section of the border be surveyed. In mid-April of the twenty-fourth year, China and Britain exchanged notes and organized a joint Boundary Commission, with each government appointing two members and the chairman of the International Administrative Court selecting a neutral member to serve as chairman. At the end of November of that year, the five commissioners led their staff to Hushan and began the survey. The survey work was based on the old treaty of 1897, and a virtual boundary line was temporarily established based on natural conditions such as the watershed, the line of red latitude, and the names of mountains and rivers. Whenever this virtual line conflicted with the boundaries of political regions, both sides would provide human and material evidence to modify the line, with the neutral chairman making the final decision. This method must be said to be quite fair. Now, that section of our southwestern border that was undefined has been surveyed and demarcated using this fair method. This will undoubtedly be of great benefit to our country's southwestern border administration and national defense. We should thank the five commissioners and all the staff for their hard work over the past two years. We should especially thank the British government for the goodwill it has shown so clearly in this survey.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we cannot forget the assistance provided by the people of the border areas to this survey work. We know that if the people of Pan Hong had not resisted the intrusion of foreign armed forces, the border survey issue might not have been raised until now. During the survey, the will of the local residents was a key factor in determining territorial sovereignty. This is what the Boundary Commission was concerned with. In recent decades, although the influence of Western churches has penetrated deep into the villages of the Yunnan border, the backward people of the border areas have never forgotten their motherland. Last month, the people of Meng Suo even warmly welcomed our commissioners with the Piaoniu Festival. This is very gratifying. If the central and local authorities can henceforth pay attention to the welfare of the border people and make an effort to develop the culture of the border areas, then the border people can become an important force on the national defense line.</p>
<p>The Yunnan-Burma border that has now been surveyed is only the southern section. There is also the more important undefined northern section in the Pianma area. In the spirit of friendship between the two countries, it will of course be possible to survey and demarcate it soon. Our southwestern border has been ambiguous for decades, and now it is beginning to be clarified. From this, we cannot help but think of the northeastern border. From the perspective of international justice, this is very clear. But from a political point of view, is it not already very blurred? We cannot tolerate this phenomenon. We must ask everyone to work hard to restore the blur to its original clarity.</p>
<h3>Japanese General Election Held Today</h3>
<p>Struggle Between Political Parties and Government; Subject to Public Judgment</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The struggle between the Japanese political parties and the government, which has lasted for the past four weeks, will be subjected to the public judgment of the entire nation tomorrow. All parties directly involved in the struggle are now holding their breath and watching the results of the general election. At the same time, the public's attitude towards tomorrow's vote is extremely silent, and it is expected that the number of people who will give up their right to vote will be greater than in any previous election. The government's severe repression of the election campaign has made the people fear punishment, so many people have decided to give up their right to vote. In addition, the general feeling among the public is that even if a new House of Representatives is elected, the government will not only not resign because of the majority opposition, but may even order the House to dissolve again. For this reason, the enthusiasm of the public has been greatly reduced. The headquarters of the major political parties have issued orders to their branches throughout the country, ordering them to prepare for the most determined offensive. On the government side, it is expected that the position of the Minseito as the largest party in parliament will be ceded to the Seiyukai by a margin of about a dozen votes. However, the cooperation between the Minseito and the Seiyukai is extremely close, and the question of who is the largest party has no impact on their anti-government united front. The Minseito and Seiyukai have been very cautious in nominating candidates this time, so even if there are those who are persuaded by the government to join the new political party after being elected, the number will not be very large. The Social Democratic Party has decided to oppose the government. On the other hand, the number of seats won by the Showakai and the Kokumin Domei, which are government and semi-government factions, will be reduced. However, the government has never considered that the current election will shake its position, so it has resolutely reduced the importance of the election. The only significance of the election now is to prove whether the majority of the people oppose the government. The Hayashi Cabinet is currently facing great public resistance, and its continued administration will undoubtedly increase the latent crisis. Although dissolving the parliament again before the convocation of a special session does not violate the constitution, in reality this is unlikely to happen. It is said that opinions within the cabinet on this issue are quite divided, and the key to the final decision lies with the Minister of the Army and the Minister of the Navy. Therefore, the convocation of a special session will not be held in mid-July as previously stipulated, but in August, giving the government more time to develop its countermeasures. Apparently, there seems to be an inseparable link between the two issues of dissolving the parliament for the second time and amending the election law, because if the latter is not successful, it will be difficult to change the parliamentary situation even if the general election is held for the third or fourth time. However, in order to implement an amendment to the election law that is favorable to the government, it is necessary to obtain an emergency edict from the Emperor, and there are many obstacles, one of which is the possible opposition of the Privy Council. (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Ministry of Home Affairs believes that the number of violations of the election law since the start of the current general election campaign until today has been greatly reduced compared to the last general election, and is confident that tomorrow's voting day will also achieve good results and that there will be no violations. The government's proposed cleaning up of the election campaign has now taken effect, and the work of purifying the political world has also taken a step forward. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs, seeing that the election situation is so calm, fears that illegal activities may occur during the voting, and has issued a serious order to local governors to crack down on the election campaign on the final day.

<h3>Japanese Ministry of Finance Revises Official System</h3>
<p>Strengthening the Contents of the Four Bureaus</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Ministry of Finance has revised its official system, and starting from early May, it will add a section to each of the four bureaus: Finance, Banking, Exchange, and Funds. The Finance Bureau will establish a Financial Section to manage the investigation and planning of general finance and study specific issues related to controlling finance and increasing capital. The Banking Bureau will establish an Investigation Section to manage various investigative affairs. The Exchange Bureau will establish a Foreign Investment Section to crack down on non-exchange exports and foreign currency securities. The Funds Bureau will establish a Funds Section to manage short-term funds, special loans, and other fund-related matters. By revising its official system in this way and strengthening the various bureaus, the Ministry of Finance intends to establish new financial and exchange policies. Financial circles believe that this is closely related to the compilation of the next fiscal year's budget and future foreign trade policies. (Allied News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>Destruction of Ancient Spanish City Outrages the British</h3>
<p>Responsibility Unclear - Efforts Being Made to Rescue Women and Children from Danger</p>
<p>[London] The British House of Commons is outraged by the destruction of the ancient city of Guernica by the Spanish Nationalist forces. Labor MP Attlee suggested to Foreign Secretary Eden today that he should jointly protest to the Nationalist leader Franco with other countries about this incident. He also suggested that since this non-military place was bombed and Germany was involved, a similar protest should be lodged with Hitler. Eden replied that the British government deeply regretted the destruction of this ancient city, where civilians had no protection, regardless of who was responsible. The British government has taken very public steps, and its attitude is clear to both sides. As for how to promote the agreement of various countries to protect non-combatant civilians in the future, the British government will consider its capabilities and decide on further actions to avoid similar incidents in the future, as such events are lamented by the civilized world. Sinclair, the leader of the Liberal Party and the government faction, added that the bombing of Guernica and the strafing of civilians with machine guns were different from the suffering of civilians in ordinary warfare. This was a deliberate use of air power as a tool of massacre and terror. The British government should lodge a strong protest to express the anger of the British people. Eden said that what he had already said was enough to express the public opinion of both sides in Parliament. Eden also said that the British government had ensured that the Spanish belligerent groups did not use poison gas, and would continue to do so as far as possible. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the bombing of the city of Guernica in the Basque Autonomous Region by Spanish Nationalist aircraft, British political figures, especially those from the left-wing parties, were greatly disturbed. They said that the policy of non-intervention in the Spanish civil war was not intended to assist the Nationalist forces. However, since the government forces were unable to import foreign military supplies, the direct assistance of the German and Italian air forces to the Nationalist forces must also be stopped in order to be fair. In addition, several members of parliament held a meeting in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon to discuss the evacuation of ordinary people from the port of Bilbao in the Basque Region. Mr. Lichaso, the representative of the Basque Region in London, was also present. A withdrawal plan was immediately drafted. Labor MP Lawberzi stated afterwards that the British government was reportedly prepared to send warships to Bilbao to assist. In short, any plan that aims to evacuate civilians is fully supported by our country's foreign affairs authorities. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>[London] Labor MP Lawberzi issued a statement today, saying that the British Foreign Office strongly supports the evacuation of civilians from Bilbao. Many members of the British House of Commons are now trying to rescue children from Bilbao from danger. They originally planned to send the merchant ship Byckward to load the children, but because the matter was of great importance and could not be handled by one ship, they consulted with the Basque authorities and planned to charter a ship in the port of Saint-Jean-de-Luz to load the children and leave the country. It is also reported that the French government is willing to provide free transportation. Fundraising has now begun to accommodate children in the UK or France in the future. The British Foreign Office naturally supports the principle of evacuating civilians, but has not yet expressed its views on whether the navy will participate in this work.

<h3>Spanish Rebels Deny Destroying Ancient City</h3>
<p>Claim Basque Forces Set Fire - Germany Also Denies Aiding Bombing</p>
<p>Saramonga The Nationalist forces here issued a communique today stating that, according to Basque prisoners, when the Nationalist forces were nine miles from Guernica, the Basque government forces completely destroyed the city. The Nationalist forces never used the city for military purposes. Our army's aircraft only bombed military buildings and industrial areas behind the front lines. In addition, the recent days have been foggy and the weather has been bad, and the aircraft have been unable to fly. Therefore, the destruction of Guernica cannot be attributed to the Nationalist forces. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>Vitoria The Nationalist headquarters recently issued a statement denying rumors that the city of Guernica was bombed by Nationalist aircraft and then caught fire. It also said that the leader of New Spain has always respected the traditional freedoms of the Basque Region. People of the Basque Region, you should quickly abandon your weapons and surrender, and drive away the culprits who intend to destroy you. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Bilbao Regarding the destruction of the ancient Basque capital of Guernica and the town of Eibar, the Nationalist forces said that the government forces set the fire themselves and that it had nothing to do with the Nationalist forces. Today, Dr. Aguirre, the president of the Basque government, issued an article denouncing it as a lie. He said, "I testify by God that German aircraft bombed the undefended civilians in this ancient capital for three and a half hours. With their unprecedented barbaric behavior, they bombed this ancient capital to the ground and used machine guns to persecute women and children, causing countless deaths. The rest were terrified and ran away to avoid it." (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the bombing of the city of Guernica in the Spanish Basque Region, the country's Republican government recently issued a statement stating that it was due to the instigation of the Italian and German General Staff. On the Nationalist side, a statement was also issued, resolutely denying that Nationalist aircraft dropped bombs. British political figures were reportedly surprised by the news, but believed that the statements of the two sides were not necessarily contradictory. The Standard Evening News reported, "The city of Guernica is the ancient capital of the Basque Region. Its bombing is the most tragic situation since the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. What we want to know is who should be responsible for this." (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Rumors that the Spanish Nationalist forces bombed Guernica and that Germany was involved are resolutely denied here. It is claimed that no Germans or German aircraft participated in the destruction of the ancient city and the massacre of hundreds of women and children. A German spokesperson also said that the destruction of the ancient city was regrettable to everyone, but Germany did not participate in it. It is reported that the German authorities made this defense because Aguirre, the president of the Spanish Basque Autonomous Region, had issued a declaration saying that the bombing of Guernica was carried out by German pilots in the Nationalist forces. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding Dr. Aguirre, the president of the Basque Autonomous Region, accusing the German Air Force of helping the rebels and bombing the historically famous city of Guernica, the German newspapers expressed their indignation at this, saying that the Bolsheviks were repeating their old tricks of malicious propaganda. Why is the world's press being deceived and attacking Germany? They continued to say that the British left-wing newspapers are deliberately confusing the public, not only opposing Franco, but also directly opposing Germany. (National Sea Communication dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The German News Agency resolutely refuted rumors that German aircraft participated in the bombing of the Basque city by the Spanish Nationalist forces, saying that the weather was unusually gloomy and did not allow any aerial activity. (National Sea Communication dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Bilbao A woman named Maria Goiatia recently escaped from the city of Guernica to this port and gave an interview to our reporter, saying that the city originally had 13,000 residents. After being strafed by aircraft belonging to the rebel army yesterday, those who died were nearly one-third of the total number of residents. The others fled to the fields and forests in a hail of bullets. That day (i.e., the day of the bombing) was Sunday, which happened to be market day. Residents from nearby villages gathered in the city to purchase goods. The first aircraft of the rebel army appeared in the sky at 4 pm. Suddenly, bombs fell, and many people died first. The crowd saw this and immediately fled from the market to the houses. Several other aircraft followed and threw bombs at the houses and churches. As a result, many people died in the rubble. At the same time, the roofs of all the houses caught fire and burned. The residents in the houses all ran out to escape. The aircraft then flew at low altitude and strafed downwards with machine guns. The people on the street were not allowed to re-enter the houses. Because the fire was raging in the houses, they were forced to escape again. I (Goiatia claimed) also ran to escape into the houses. When I saw the houses on fire, I rushed out again like a madman, and then went to the fields and under the thorns, crawling and walking quickly. The skin on my face was covered with wounds, but I didn't care. It was not until 8 am the next morning that the aircraft of the rebel army flew away and I was able to escape safely.

<h3>Basque Forces Retreating Step by Step</h3>
<p>Four More British Ships Arrive in the Port of Bilbao</p>
<p>Andai General Mola's troops, the commander of the rebel army in the north, continued to advance towards Bilbao along the Nervion Avenue today. The front line has been shortened to 25 miles. Aircraft are still exerting great power. More than ten towns surrounding Bilbao are on fire, and there are countless deaths and injuries. The red, white, and green national flag of the Basque Republic has been replaced by the gold and yellow flag of the imperial era in 27 towns. The government troops are retreating in panic and are coming to the city of Bilbao to make a final stand. According to a deserter from the Nationalist army, there are German and Italian troops participating in the attacking army. However, the authorities firmly stated that the victory belongs entirely to the national army. An unconfirmed message today said that the rebel army's aircraft distributed leaflets in the air, saying that after destroying Eibar and Gernika, 200,000 residents held a meeting demanding that the president of the Basque provisional government, Aguirre, negotiate surrender terms with the rebel army. Judging from the current situation, the losses on both sides in the past week have set a new record since the civil war. (National Telegraph dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Bilbao The Basque army abandoned Durango at 6 pm tonight. All troops and military supplies were withdrawn successively according to plan without any losses. However, the mountainous area south of Durango is still in Basque hands. The Basque side also claimed that the rebel army's aircraft had recently strafed the Amorbieta monastery with machine guns. The monastery has now been converted into a hospital for the wounded, and a very large red cross symbol is painted on the roof. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Bilbao Four more British cargo ships broke through the Spanish Nationalist army's blockade line today and arrived here without any mishaps along the way.

<h3>Negotiations on the New Locarno Pact Are Quite Tortuous</h3>
<p>Belgian Foreign Minister to Deliver a Speech Declaring the Country's Future Policy</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the question of whether the new Locarno Pact will be established soon, although diplomatic circles here are not very optimistic, it is reported that the governments of the UK, France, and Germany will exchange views through diplomatic channels. The Times recently reported that the authorities of the UK and Belgium seemed to have agreed that if a new pact is to be concluded, the most promising method would be for Belgium to separately conclude non-aggression pacts with its three major neighbors, the UK, France, and Germany, and attach the necessary mutual assistance obligations to protect Belgium's eastern and western borders from aggression by other countries. As for the mutual assistance conditions, they should be thoroughly examined by the diplomatic authorities of the countries concerned before any action can be taken. The report also said that the country has now decided to continue to abide by the League of Nations Covenant, which has disappointed Germany. The conclusion is that the League of Nations Covenant is still the most powerful guarantee for preventing war at this time. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden replied to a question from Hunterson, a Labor MP from the opposition party, in the House of Commons today, saying that, according to his prediction, the general staff of the UK, France, and Belgium will not hold any talks at present. People in Parliament interpreted the Foreign Secretary's statement as meaning that because military experts from the UK, France, and Belgium had been traveling back and forth, which was inconvenient from the perspective of the country's internal affairs, Eden made the above statement to indicate that the personnel of the general staff of the three countries would no longer have any contact. The intention was to satisfy Belgium. People around Foreign Secretary Eden argued that, in the event of an emergency in the UK, the way to assist Belgium in the future could be jointly studied by the military attachés of the two embassies through the usual channels. In addition, it has been verified that Eden has received a formal guarantee from Belgium that the country's authorities will try to prevent foreign military aircraft from flying over Belgian territory. If such a situation occurs, the British government will be notified immediately. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Beijing Foreign Minister Spaak is scheduled to deliver a speech in the House of Representatives tomorrow, explaining the international status of Belgium after the UK and France issued a declaration. Spaak has recently notified the Socialist Party caucus in the House of Representatives of the outline of this speech. Political figures now believe that Spaak's speech will include the following points: (1) The guarantees provided by the UK and France should take effect in the current situation. In the future, if the following two situations occur, the UK and France can reconsider the guarantees they have provided. The two situations are that Belgium relaxes its efforts in national defense or abandons the League of Nations. (2) Belgium has complete freedom to decide whether to allow foreign troops to pass through its borders. However, this freedom to decide is limited if these troops are "participating in joint actions." (3) Announce that the general staff agreement signed between Belgium and the UK and France no longer exists. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 28th)</p>

<h3>Tragic Situation of Drought in Various Counties in Western Henan</h3>
<p>Villagers in Gong County Starve to Death as a Family - Linru Has People Filling Their Stomachs with Goose Dung</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Correspondence: The drought in various counties in western Henan this year is extremely severe. The tragic situation in various places is truly unprecedented. The details of each situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Yichuan Near Jiangzihe Ludian area in Yichuan's fifth district, the harvest of wheat is hopeless, and autumn crops and cotton cannot be sown due to drought. People are unusually panicked and are taking their families to flee. Zhang Sanbei from Zhang Village recently took his wife and three-year-old daughter to Nanyang to flee the famine. When they reached near Nanshankou, his daughter starved to death. Also, in the Jiangzuo Town Ludian area in the fourth and fifth districts of the county, there are countless people selling their children and daughters in the market every time it is market day. The cries of suffering are unbearable.</p>
<p>Gong County Li Wang, a resident of Xicun Township, located more than 50 miles southwest of Gong County City at the foot of the Songshan Mountains, is from a well-to-do family and makes a living by farming. He owns more than 30 mu of thin fields on the ridge. More than ten people in his family live by farming. Last year's wheat harvest was only a few stones, which had already been eaten up long ago. Last autumn's wheat was not sown, resulting in no food to eat. The whole family went out to beg for a living. Until this spring, the drought was still unusual, and not a drop of rain fell. Recently, they have been repeatedly hit by wind disasters. Food is scarce everywhere, and the disaster situation is the same. Li led his family to beg from village to village, but was turned away everywhere. They went without food for many days, and more than ten people in the family starved to death one after another. Seeing no way out, Li also hanged himself at home a few days ago.</p>
<p>Linru The drought in Linru and other counties is unprecedented in decades. There are cries of mourning everywhere, and starving people are dying on the roads. The disaster victims rely entirely on tree bark, grass roots, and fruits to fill their stomachs. Recently, more people have been filling their stomachs with goose dung and stone powder. The miserable situation is unbearable to hear. According to the investigation, their daily food is as follows: soft stone (ground into fine powder and mixed with miscellaneous flour to make cakes), stone flour (same method as above), goose dung (dissolved in water, roasted dry to remove the smell, made into cakes, steamed buns, or boiled into paste), selected fruit pits (boiled to remove the shells, dried in the sun, ground into powder, and mixed with miscellaneous flour to make cakes), soybeans (steamed to remove bitterness, crushed and boiled into paste), cottonseed (mixed with grains, ground into flour to make cakes), sweet potato stems (dried in the sun, crushed to make cakes, steamed buns, or boiled into paste), peanut shells (roasted and mixed with grains, ground into flour to make cakes), buckwheat flowers (boiled soft to make cakes), Qin pepper leaves (dried in the sun, mixed with miscellaneous flour to make paste), large cotton (boiled and soaked in cold water to remove bitterness, steamed buns or cakes), acorns (ground into flour to make cakes, steamed buns, or boiled into paste), corn cobs (roasted, crushed, and mixed with miscellaneous flour to make cakes, steamed buns, or boiled into paste), elm bark (ground into flour to make paste), white grass roots (washed, dried, and crushed to make cakes). The above foods are only a few types listed according to the investigation. As for wheat stalks, grain stems, and other things with no nutrients, there are countless disaster victims who use them as food. (26th)</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Judgment in the Wang Jingwei Assassination Case (Continued)</h3>
<p>(5) Regarding He Poguang's part, it was found that the defendant He Poguang, around September of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, came to Beijing with Hua Kezhi, Zhang Yuhua, and others to establish the Chenguang News Agency. He served in the agency, participated in the assassination plot, and repeatedly entrusted people to obtain reporter passes from the Central Party Headquarters, and escorted Sun Fengming into the venue. He repeatedly confessed not only during the investigations by the Gendarmerie Headquarters and the prosecutor but also admitted when questioned by this court that he obtained the pass and escorted Sun Fengming to the Central Party Headquarters. In his confession, it was stated that "Hua Kezhi's main mission in running the news agency was to assassinate government officials" (see page of the second volume of the confession). "The first time was during the Fifth Plenary Session when I went to the Central Party Headquarters to get the pass. Zhang Yuhua accompanied Sun Fengming to wait for me at Dingjiaqiao. The pass was obtained after Wu Huang's negotiation and handed over to Zhang Yuhua for transfer. I saw Sun go in and then went to Shanghai with Zhang. As a result, Sun did not act, and Guo Zifeng telegraphed to return to Beijing." "The second time was when President Wang resigned and Chairman Jiang flew to Beijing. After I sent Sun to the Central Party Headquarters, Zhang Yuhua, Guo Zifeng, Guo's concubine, Guo's daughter, and I took a car to Zhenjiang and stayed at the Wuzhou Hotel. In the afternoon, we learned that no action was taken, and we returned to Beijing that night." (see pages 6 and 7 of the third volume of the confession). "The third time was on the morning of November 1st, when Sun and Liu and I went to the Central Party Headquarters. On the way, Sun said to me, 'Give me the pass, and you leave quickly.' I replied, 'I hope you will act as the opportunity arises and do not force yourself.' Sun and Liu waited in a teahouse in Dingjiaqiao. I went to the Central Party Headquarters, but the staff had not arrived because it was too early, so I returned to the teahouse for tea. At 7:40, I went to the Central Party Headquarters again, and at 8:10, I obtained the pass and handed it over to Liu Shurong. Then I took a car to Hepingmen and took the 8:30 third- and fourth-class train to Zhenjiang," and other statements (see page 13 of the second volume of the confession). Now, he argues that he did not agree with Sun's assassination and did not participate in the opinion beforehand. Empty words of reversal are not trustworthy. Furthermore, it was found that the defendant made the following statement to Sun Fengming on October 28, 24th year, according to his confession: "I greatly admire you for your willingness to take on the heroic mission of leading the way," which shows that he did have a plan for the implementation method of Sun Fengming's crime and used words such as "heroic mission" and "admiration" to encourage him. His actions were no different from those who aided and abetted the commission of a crime and should be considered a joint principal offender of the crime of murder according to law.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding Yu Likui, Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Hu Dahai, Zhou Shiping, Xiang Zhonglin, Li Huaicheng, Lu Qingqi, and others' assassination of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei,</p>
<p>It was found that the defendants Yu Likui, Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Hu Dahai, and Zhou Shiping repeatedly participated in plotting and planning to assassinate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President Wang Jingwei during the years 23 and 24 of the Republic of China, observed whether Sun Fengming was determined, and Li Huaicheng, Xiang Zhonglin, and Lu Qingqi were responsible for activity funds, encouraging implementation, and receiving entrusted weapons during the assassination plan. Wang Renshan, who witnessed the planning situation, repeatedly testified in detail before the Higher Court, this court's prosecutor, the Hong Kong Central Magistracy, and this court, and the defendants Zhang, He, Liu, Li, Xiang, Lu, and others uniformly confessed during the investigations by the Gendarmerie Headquarters and the prosecutor. Furthermore, the injuries sustained by President Wang were diagnosed by doctors at the Central Hospital as having three locations throughout the body: ㊀ In the left zygomatic area, the entry point below the outer corner of the left eye was about 7 mm in diameter. The bullet slanted outward, and the zygomatic bone was slightly broken. The bullet was in the temporalis muscle outside the zygomatic bone, and the left eye was swollen. ㊁ In the left upper shoulder, in the middle third, it went from back to front and was a penetrating wound. It did not injure the bone nerves or blood vessels. The bullet entry point was about 7 mm in diameter, and the exit point was about 8 mm. ㊂ In the back, the entry point was on the right side of the seventh thoracic vertebra spinous process, obliquely upward to the left. The bullet was on the left side of the sixth thoracic vertebra spinous process. The entry point diameter was about 7 mm. In addition, there were numerous contusions scattered throughout the body. The detailed expert report is attached to the file. Moreover, the facts that Sun Fengming carried out the attack at the Central Party Headquarters and was arrested on the spot were explained in great detail by Central Committee member Zhang Ji during successive investigations by the Supreme Court Prosecutor and this court's prosecutor. It is not without considerable proof. However, among the above evidence, Wang Renshan's testimony is the most important, and the reasons for accepting it should be explained first.</p>
<p>Reviewing Wang Renshan's successive testimonies in this case, he stated that Wang Yaqiao was the leader of the assassination group, and the defendant Yu Likui was Wang's highest-ranking cadre. Since the defendant admitted to knowing Wang Yaqiao and claimed to have met Wang Renshan, Wang Renshan's account is believable. Furthermore, Wang Yaqiao often hosted banquets in the defendant's residence at No. 10 Yongxing Street, as Cheng Yiquan also testified in the Hong Kong court. No matter how the defendant denied Wang Renshan's testimony, he cannot overturn it with empty words. Wang Renshan's so-called "highest-ranking cadre" and Cheng Yiquan's statement that banquets were held at the defendant's house corroborate each other. It cannot be excused by claiming that he never met Wang Yaqiao in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>According to Wang Renshan, the defendant Zhou Shiping often lived at Yu Likui's house. On this point, not only did Zhou Shiping confess so, but Yu Likui did not deny it. In addition, considering Zhou Shiping's location of arrest and Cheng Yiquan's statement, it is sufficient to prove that Wang Renshan's statement is believable. Moreover, the defendants lived in the same place as Wang Yaqiao's confidant Zheng Yijian in Hong Kong. Wang Yaqiao often went to Zheng's house, and the defendants who lived with Zheng must have met him. Furthermore, the letters carried by Hu Dahai in Zheng Yijian's handbag also mentioned the names of the defendants Yu and Zhou, indicating that the relationship between the defendants and Wang Yaqiao was very close and not just a meeting and acquaintance.

<h3>Summary of the Second General Assembly of the Zhejiang Provincial Financial Research Association</h3>
<p>Zhu Jiahua Details Financial Key Points - Formally Approves the Liang and Zhou Report</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: Zhejiang's finances in the past were heavily burdened by the construction of Meng Jin, resulting in significant deficits over the years. This mismatch between revenue and expenditure greatly affected the province's administrative development. Since assuming office, the current Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Zhu Jiahua, has considered finance the foundation of all administrative measures. After a detailed examination of the years of deficits and chaotic situations, he believes that unless a thorough adjustment and improvement is made and concrete financial measures are determined, all administrative affairs will be impossible to advance. Therefore, Zhu specially invited economic and financial experts Liang Hejun, Zhou Shouliang, Xu Xinggong, Peng Hu, Yin Guoyong, Zhang Liangren, Li Chaoying, and Pan Zhongjia to form the Zhejiang Provincial Financial Research Committee. The first meeting was convened in Hangzhou on February 5th. Subsequently, because most of the committee members were in Shanghai, Liang and Zhou were responsible for convening six group meetings and one joint meeting of all groups in Shanghai, one after another. They conducted rigorous research on the actual financial problems in Zhejiang Province and compiled the Zhejiang Provincial Financial Research Report. The content of the report is very complete, with detailed descriptions and suggestions on the current state of Zhejiang's finances and the points that should be reformed. After this research work came to an end, Zhu Jiahua personally presided over the second plenary committee meeting in the meeting hall of the Zhejiang Provincial Government in Hangzhou a few days ago. Those present on that day were Liang Jingchun, Zhou Shouliang, Xu Xinggong, Peng Hu, Yin Guoyong, Zhang Liangren, and Li Chaoying. Yan Rengeng was present as an observer. Chairman Zhu Jiahua delivered a speech on the spot, expressing sincere admiration and gratitude to the committee members for their enthusiasm and assistance in conducting long-term research and producing a detailed report. He also asked the committee members to continue the discussion and provide as many opinions as possible. Then, committee member Liang Jingchun reported on the compilation process of the report.</p>
<p>Liang Jingchun reports on the compilation process, briefly stating: "After the first meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Financial Research Committee, colleagues began to conduct research separately in Shanghai and convened group meetings and joint group meetings many times. Because we are relatively far apart, it is more difficult to convene meetings and collect materials. However, under these circumstances, we collected 131 materials. Now, colleagues respectfully present a report book compiled on the research process. The opinions that colleagues intend to contribute have been described in detail in the recommendations in the report. As for the content of the report, it is not very substantial, and I am afraid that there is not much good to contribute." Then, Zhu Jiahua gave a detailed report on the various financial problems in Zhejiang Province, with the content as follows:</p>
<p>Zhu Jiahua details the main points: "I just heard Committee Member Liang's explanation of the report, which was very detailed and clear. Everyone has important duties, and in the midst of busy schedules, you did this very heavy work in a short period of more than two months. You collected as many as 131 reference materials and thoroughly researched the province's finances, making a report of more than 110 pages. The book is divided into two parts: current situation and suggestions. The former allows readers to understand the current financial situation of the province at a glance, and the latter provides concrete solutions to the actual financial problems of the province. This kind of practical contribution is not only admired and appreciated by this humble servant but since the last first meeting on February 5th, I have exchanged views with the Liang and Zhou committee members several times when I went to Shanghai and saw the records of the group meetings. Therefore, after several considerations by this humble servant and Director Cheng, some of the things have already begun, and some are being planned. Let me briefly report on them and ask you to correct them. ㊀ Budget and final accounts issue: We must ensure that there is a solid budget and final account starting from the 26th year. However, I took over the matter in mid-November of last year, and because I was waiting for the results of everyone's research, it has not yet been established. Now, the deadline is before June 20th to completely handle it to make this budget a reality. We have now hired several financiers who have been involved in the province's finances in the past to form an independent budget review committee. However, this is not a decision-making body. After they review it, they will send it to the Provincial Government Committee for decision. This review committee may become a permanent body in the future. The letters of appointment for each committee member have been issued, and the first meeting will be convened soon to exchange opinions and then determine the direction of progress. ㊁ Treasury accounting system issue: This is the most important thing in relation to financial administration. This province has already started to implement it last year, and now I want to complete the initial treasury system in the whole province and universally establish branches and offices of the Zhejiang Local Bank. It is hoped that each county and major town will gradually be established. As for places where there is no need to establish them, the post office will be entrusted to handle them, and the post office and the local bank should have mutual assistance effects. Regarding the implementation of the new treasury system with a public treasury spirit, we will start with the Finance Department and its directly subordinate agencies, then the agencies below the Provincial Government in the provincial capital, and then gradually implement it to the agencies below the county, gradually completing the thorough implementation of the various levels of agencies in the province. As for the new accounting system, it is also being prepared for implementation. I have always paid attention to "achieving management through accounting." Now, the accounting section of the Finance Department has been strengthened, and we are preparing to gradually divide these matters and powers and establish a provincial accounting office together with the National Government's Accounting Office so that accounting is completely independent. We will start implementing the two systems of treasury and accounting on July 1st, and we have already asked the Examination Yuan to hold a special examination for accounting personnel to recruit accounting talents. We will provide short-term training within June. I hope to be able to complete the above two things completely in one or two years. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Fighting for Sha Tian</p>
<p>The Sha Tian dispute in Shazhou City, 7th District, has recently flared up again. On the morning of the day before yesterday (the 28th), an organized beating occurred, resulting in a total of 15 people injured, missing, and dead. The Shazhou City Welfare Reclamation Company was reorganized last month, leading to disagreements between the new and old directors. For business reasons, the new directors hired the Xinji Construction Company to build a large embankment project, but the old directors strongly opposed it. Therefore, on the morning of the day before yesterday, they gathered more than 300 thugs, each holding a sharp weapon, and rushed to Nanfeng Town, surrounding the Xinji workshop's warehouse group, intending to destroy it. Because they were unprepared, most of the workers were injured. Afterwards, foreman Yang Songlin counted a total of 12 injured and 2 missing. Li Hongbin's face was slashed in half, and he died at 4 o'clock due to serious injuries.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Water Police Detain Bandits</p>
<p>The detective team of the 2nd district of the Water Police, the night before last, arrested the bandit Xu Fubao near Laiyuan Bridge in Xumen. They also arrested Wu Binyuan in Xishan Chang Lane, and seized a bandit boat and a suspect Ma Agou near Wannan Bridge Wharf. According to the investigation by Captain Hui, Xu Fubao and others confessed that they robbed the families of Li Xiang in Shijialang and Mo Genshou in Pangjiabang, spending the stolen money without dispute. They were sent to the district headquarters on the 29th to await further investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Granaries Lend Grain</p>
<p>In order to lend grain to relieve poverty and reduce the loss of accumulated grain, the Wuxi County Government has formulated ten grain accumulation and lending measures with reference to the provincial outline for local granary construction and grain accumulation methods, and taking into account the actual situation in the county. During the annual period between spring and summer harvests, poor households are allowed to apply for loans of accumulated grain, first applying to reliable households in the district or the township chief for guarantee, and the loan is released after the district granary or township granary custodian verifies the situation. When the new grain is harvested, interest is added at 1%, and the principal and interest are returned to the granary. Yesterday morning, County Chief Long specially convened all district chiefs in the county to discuss the measures in detail. After amendments were made, they were submitted to the province for approval on the same day. During this year's lean season, all districts will uniformly provide loans to relieve the poor.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation of Land Administration Bureau Case</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the former director of the Wuxi County Land Administration Bureau, Hu Pinfang, being accused of corruption, the director of the Provincial Land Administration Bureau, Zhu Ping, sent a special commissioner to Wuxi to thoroughly investigate all parties and ordered the county accounting director, Yan Shudong, to suspend all accounts of the bureau, fee receipts, and receipts for the profits that had been turned over to the bureau for detailed investigation. Also, because the various receipts were all printed by You Yiqi downstream of Cangqiao, there was suspicion of collusion. Yesterday, You Yiqi was also suspended to take various account books to verify and check, and the amount of one yuan custody fee collected was also inconsistent, and the amount of corruption was not small. Also, the salaries of all employees during Hu's tenure, including the village registrars, a total of more than 250 people, have not been paid since February, and they will reach March. Yesterday, they also jointly appealed to the provincial bureau, requesting the release.</p>

<h3>This City Prepares to Celebrate the Grand Ceremony of the British King's Coronation</h3>
<p>Electric Lights Dazzling and Brilliant</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times stated that May 12th is the coronation day of British King George VI. The Shanghai Foreign Banks Association has resolved that all banks in the association will be closed on that day. The consulates will be closed on the 11th and 12th. The Shanghai celebration plan has now reached the final stage. It is expected that the splendor of the lights along the Bund will be no less than the 25th anniversary of the accession to the throne of the late British King George V in the spring of 1935. At that time, Chinese agencies will raise the national flag, and the whole country will fire salutes to express international friendship. Although lighting at night and hanging flags and colorful streamers on various buildings are at the discretion of each business, according to the British authorities, the lighting is scheduled to start on May 11th and continue for three days until the 13th. HSBC has built prominent celebration lights, and the Cathay Hotel and Sassoon House are also under construction. The huge archway at the entrance of the British Consulate General has been under construction for several days. At that time, almost all the giant buildings on the Bund will be brilliantly illuminated with electric lights, and the lights of the Waibaidu Bridge will be the most dazzling. British businesses whose addresses are not suitable for decorating with lights have raised funds in this important area to decorate in order to express their congratulations to their monarch. Several British warships in the port, led by the cruiser HMS Cumberland, will be fully decorated with flags and colorful streamers. At night, the lights of the ships will be brilliant, making the river as bright as day. HMS Cumberland will carry Vice Admiral Guido, commander-in-chief of the British fleet in China, to Shanghai on May 5th. Sir Pelling is the chairman of the Shanghai coronation celebration. The flagship of the US Asian Fleet, USS Augusta, will also arrive in the near future. People from all countries in Shanghai will also help celebrate together. The Chinese preparations are particularly exciting. However, May 12th is the anniversary of the death of Kuomintang leader Hu Hanmin. It is reported that the Central Party Headquarters has ordered all party headquarters to hold a memorial meeting on May 10th in advance so that the national flag can be hoisted and salutes can be fired across the country on May 12th to honor the monarch of a friendly country, thereby fulfilling international friendship.</p>
<p>At the last meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Chairman Mauckling proposed that, in order to celebrate with the British community, it was planned to hang flags in front of the Council's general office building on the coronation day of British King George VI and Queen Victoria to decorate it, and the British national flag and the Municipal Council's flag would be erected on the roof. This proposal has been unanimously approved by the directors, and all arrangements are being prepared by the Council's Works Department.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Communications Actively Promotes International Calls</h3>
<p>The matter of telephone calls between China and other countries is now being actively promoted by the Ministry of Communications. The trial calls for Sino-US wireless telephones have been going on for a long time and the results are very good. It is hoped that official calls can be made within the year. There are also various machines for Sino-British, Sino-German, Sino-Italian, and other lines have been assembled and are also in trial talks. The Sino-Italian line once held a trial call with Shanghai when Special Envoy Kong arrived in Italy, and the results were still good. All lines are now being trialled one after another to be completed as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Gao Yuzhu, Yu Jiecai, and Others Visit County Administration</p>
<p>Led by Huang Jingwan, they went to the welcome meeting hosted by County Magistrate Li.</p>
<p>Representatives of the indigenous chieftains from the southwestern Yi ethnic group, including Gao Yuzhu, the current chieftain of Beisheng in Yunnan, and Yu Jiecai, a representative of the petitioning southwestern Yi ethnic group, along with Zhang Guorui and Ming Yaowu, went to the welcome meeting hosted by Li Zhifu, the magistrate of Shanghai County, yesterday at 11 AM, led by Huang Jingwan. After Chieftain Gao arrived at the county government, County Magistrate Li and his wife welcomed the guests into the reception hall and invited Zhang Jingye, Zhang Ji, Chen Jiapu, and Jin Zuobin, members of the county party committee, to accompany them. They held a tea party and then were guided to visit various offices. At noon, a banquet was held on the third floor, with all dishes being local products of the county, which were highly praised by Chieftain Gao. After the banquet, a photo was taken. At 2 PM, a welcome meeting was held in the auditorium of the county government, with more than 300 people from the party, government, military, police, and academic circles attending. After the ceremony, County Magistrate Li delivered a welcome speech, stating, "Our country has vast land and abundant resources, and a large population. The southwestern Yi ethnic group is one of the Chinese ethnic groups, especially since they are located on the border, making unity even more necessary. This time, Chieftain Gao and Mr. Yu represent the Yi ethnic group to petition the central government, passing through Shanghai. Zhifu sincerely welcomes their visit to the county and hopes that Chieftain Gao and Representative Yu will provide guidance."</p>
<p>Then, Chieftain Gao gave a speech, stating, "Shanghai is a model county in the country. Today, I have the honor to visit this land, admire County Magistrate Li, and visit the county administration, which makes me even more confident in Shanghai's progress. Yuzhu is incompetent and feels ashamed to receive such a warm welcome from everyone. The Yi ethnic group originated in the Yellow River basin and later migrated to Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Annam, Myanmar, and other places. The population is about 20 million. Some are scattered in various places, living by buying and selling, while others are scattered in the Daliang Mountains, living by nomadism. They are strong and possess the spirit of enduring hardship. In terms of politics, they are divided into several tribes, each with a chieftain responsible for protecting the territory and maintaining peace. Due to the vast land and sparse population, they cannot be connected, leading to each tribe governing itself. Conflicts between Yi and Yi, and between Yi and Han people occur from time to time. The people of each tribe are led by the chieftain, and under the chieftain are smaller chieftains, and under the smaller chieftains are headmen. Minor matters among the people are resolved by the headmen. Murder cases are reported to the smaller chieftains. The person who commits murder is punished, and the punishment does not extend to their wife or clan. Recently, in view of the serious national situation and the need for cooperation, the Yi people in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang have become friendly with each other, and conflicts between Yi and Yi no longer occur. Military affairs are also in the hands of the chieftains. At least one strong man in each civilian family has a gun, a knife, a horse, bullets, and dry food, etc., for military needs. They usually practice martial arts and can gather millions of people in the event of an emergency. During wartime, they are willing to bravely go to the front lines. They are happy and cheer when they win, and consider defeat as the ultimate shame. The Yi people are obedient, live simple lives, and are accustomed to being organized. There are many wolves and other ferocious beasts in Yi areas. For self-defense, the Yi people usually practice shooting, and their skills are unmatched by the Han people. In terms of Yi education, each chieftain tribe has five major schools, teaching in Miao and Yi languages. The Miao language has more than 3,000 characters, making teaching difficult. The Yi language is mainly used for writing letters. There is almost no education in the Han language. Due to inconvenient transportation and expensive books, progress is hindered. As for Yi customs, etiquette is highly valued. When people see the chieftain, they kneel and bow. The clothing and food of the chieftain and the people are different. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the customs of respect and inferiority have gradually become closer. Unfortunately, the capital is tens of thousands of miles away from the Yi area, and transportation is obstructed. Unfriendly government orders have allowed neighboring countries to encroach on the region, which is very dangerous. It is important to know that the life of the country depends on the front lines, and the Yi area is an important place for national revival. This time, the petition to the capital, in addition to requesting the central government to send senior officials to appease the region, also requests the development of transportation, the establishment of party branches, the development of economic construction, and the implementation of compulsory education, so that everyone understands the party's principles, strives for construction, and further seeks unity to revive the nation. Today, I am deeply grateful for your warm welcome and wish you all good health."</p>
<p>Next, Representative Yu reported on the history of the Yi ethnic group, the distribution of land, and the customs and habits, especially the details of clothing, food, housing, transportation, marriage, childbirth, and funerals. The Yi area values women and devalues men. The family organization is dominated by women. In public gatherings, if a woman is present, the man has no right to speak. Finally, Representative Yu hoped that the government and compatriots from all over the country would sympathize with the Yi ethnic group, advocate for national unity, and develop the education of the Yi people in the southwest, so that the more than 20 million people and thousands of miles of land would forever belong to the territory of the Republic of China. The audience applauded, and the meeting adjourned at 5 PM. County Magistrate Li and others accompanied Chieftain Gao to visit the countryside and returned to Shanghai at 6 PM.</p>

<p>Jincheng Bank and Minsheng Company Jointly Establish Jialing Textile Factory</p>
<p>The capital is 3.5 million yuan in national currency. The factory is located in Dongyang Town, Beibei, Ba County.</p>
<p>Jincheng Bank and Minsheng Industrial Company have recently jointly established the Sichuan Jialing Textile Factory. Various preparations have been completed. The factory's capital is set at 3.5 million yuan in national currency, with Jincheng and Minsheng each contributing half, which has been fully subscribed. The factory site has been located in Dongyang Town, across from Beibei in Ba County. The various textile machines ordered from Toyota Factory are expected to arrive in September of this year, and construction is expected to begin in early next year. According to preliminary estimates, Sichuan's cotton production is about 400,000 dan per year. Because military uniforms are needed and difficult to purchase, efforts are currently being made to improve cotton seeds and expand production. In the future, if there are any problems with self-sufficiency in raw cotton, cotton from nearby Shashi, Yichang, and other places can be used to provide relief. With Minsheng Company's convenience in transportation, the supply of raw materials should not be a problem. It is also heard that Zeng Xiangxi has been hired as the factory manager.</p>

<p>Silk Weaving Industry Strikes: Factories Resume Work Today</p>
<p>The Social Bureau's Arbitration Measures are Strictly Implemented; Unresolved Conditions Will Be Handled Separately</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the silk weaving workers in Shanghai have been on strike for two months. After mediation by party and government agencies, the opinions of labor and management were too far apart to reach an agreement, which led to delays. The municipal government held a joint meeting of party, government, and military representatives, and decided on several measures, and summoned labor and management to give earnest instructions. Now, both labor and management have agreed and decided that all striking factories will resume work this morning, all closed factories will start work, all workers fired during the strike will be reinstated, and the 16 measures arbitrated by the Social Bureau will be fully implemented from April 1st (a subsidy of 50 cents for the Huanghuagang Memorial Day).

<p>Tobacco Addicts' License Renewal Ends Today</p>
<p>Those who have quit smoking must not fraudulently obtain licenses. Once discovered, they will be severely punished.</p>

For this reason, we request your association to continue to submit the request in accordance with the original intention, and separately send letters to the Income Tax Affairs Office and the Collection Bureau. Before receiving the ministry's order to amend, we should carefully handle matters with regard to industrial and commercial practices to ensure that they are in line with the situation and enrich tax revenues. This is our greatest prayer. Furthermore, the income tax on the industry's savings deposits will be paid to the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Third Bank today (day), and the receipt will be reported to the Shanghai Office of Income Tax."</p>

According to the plaintiffs, the police bureau accused Zhang Liansan's teahouse of gambling, so they arrested Jin Zhangshi. When they passed by Zhu Jinshi's house, because Jin Zhangshi had a child breastfeeding, they threw the child on the bed. Zhu Jinshi came out to reason, and the police tied her up and took her to the bureau. She was released on bail by the town chief He Guiliang, but she had been injured, etc. The police bureau defended that Zhang Liansan was absconding after profiting from gambling, so they took his daughter to the bureau. She escaped to Zhu Jinshi's house, so they went to arrest her. Zhu Jinshi was unreasonable and obstructed official duties, so they called the town chief to vouch for her, so she was not taken to the bureau together. They conspired to falsely accuse them, etc. During the adjournment of the case, local people once mediated, so Zhu Jinshi submitted a statement to the court requesting withdrawal, but according to the law, the crime of injury can be withdrawn, but the crime of false imprisonment cannot be withdrawn, so the judge Chen continued the trial of part of the lawsuit yesterday. Zhu Jinshi was absent due to pregnancy. The defendants hired lawyer Pan Chenge to appear in court and defend that the local customs were very bad, and there was gambling in small teahouses, which was a fact. Zhu Jinshi was a woman, and there were many policemen. If they were arrested, they would have to be tied up. Because they were performing their duties, they were involved in a lawsuit with unreasonable people. They did not think it was true. Please declare them innocent. After the court debate, the sentence was scheduled to be pronounced.</p>

<p>Zhuang Zhihe, the manager of the Hengdeli Watch Shop on Nanjing Road, 23 years old, from Ningbo, was sued in the First Special Court by the Huizhong Bank in 1933 for a guaranteed debt. Zhuang hired Qian Zhongdao, a lawyer from the same hometown (residing at No. 19, Renhua Lane, Saposai Road, French Concession), as his agent. As a result, a settlement was reached. Zhuang paid Qian 1,000 yuan in cash, entrusting him to transfer it to the creditor. However, Qian did not transfer the money after receiving it, but misappropriated it himself. After Zhuang learned of this, he negotiated with Qian. Qian deducted 500 yuan for writing fees and signed a promissory note for the remaining 500 yuan. He still could not pay it when it was due. After Zhuang urged him, he paid back 125 yuan, still owing 375 yuan. He delayed until today and still had not returned it. Zhuang Zhihe hired Chen Guocai as his lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Qian Zhongdao, seeking 375 yuan and interest at 5% per annum from March 5, 1936, until the end of the execution.
