<p>時評</p>
<h3>埃及撤廢領判權問題</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>討論撤廢埃及領事裁判權的會議。正在瑞士蒙德婁開會。將來結果如何。現在雖還不能預測。但就過去數日會塲中的融洽空氣而言。將來諒可產生相當的結果。據日前外電所傳。大會◻◻◻之總委員會業已决定完全廢除各國在埃及所享的領事裁判權。現在所討論的重要問題。祇是如何廢除的具體辦法。據英法方面的意見。埃及領事裁判權的廢除。須取漸進的辦法。以便僑居埃及的外人與外國公司。得有充分的時間與機會去準備適應領判權廢止後的新形勢。這個過渡的時期法國提議十八年。埃及則主張以十二年為限。雙方爭執未决。尚有待於大會的决定。從蒙德婁會議的一般形勢觀察。埃及的領事裁判權。在原則上雖可於最近期內廢除。而領土主權的完整與司法的獨立。則尚須待十餘年之後始能完全達到。</p>
<p>各國在埃及所享的領事裁判權。現在雖然不能立刻做到實際廢除的地步但這種原則上完全廢除的承認。於埃及主權的完整。也有相當重要的關係。因為埃及從大英帝國殖民地的地位解放出來。而成為現在的獨立國家。實在經過多次的奮鬥階段。在一九二二年。英埃條約的締訂。使埃及在名義上成為一個獨立國家。（約中因載有英國所堤出的　五項極重要的保留。所以埃及實際上仍為英國殖民地。）到了去年英埃同盟條約締訂後。英國撤退大部分的駐軍與放棄若干的特權。埃及方才達到某種程度的獨立。最近蒙德婁會議又决定在原則上完全廢除領事裁判權。這於埃及的獨立地位與主權的完整。自有相當的帮助。不過埃及要想達到眞正的獨立與司法權的完整。當然還需要很大的努力與不斷的奮鬥。</p>
<p>從蒙德婁會議的發展　與埃及領判權的廢除。不禁聯想到存在於我們自己國家內的這種非法制度。領事裁判權之實施於中國。已有數十年的歷史。享受這種非法權利的。以前有英美法日等十九個國家。現在德奧俄土捷波墨諸國雖已先後放棄。（最近西班牙因內戰關係。在華未派有正式使領人員。故其僑民。已歸中國法院管理。）但大部國家仍享有這種特權而堅不肯放棄。他們所持的理由。雖屢經我國痛予駁斥。但總是延宕着不讓找們收回。在這樣的情形之下。我們除了採取自動撤廢領判權的方法以外。實在沒有別的好法。最近上海律師公會及各公團多列舉理由。呈請政府自動收回領事裁判權。我們很希望政府能對此事有所行動。雖然在我們這個半殖民地的國家中。比這領判權更有妨害我國主權完整的事很多。而急待我們政府與民衆去共同努力奮鬥。但我們如能及早收回領判權。則做一步總比不做為佳。</p>

<h3>未來大戰的可怖（中）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>科學殺人的新方法</p>
<p>但天卜之事，有利便有弊，天空有了這個烟幕，那防衛自己的飛機，便不能活動。但是這種方法，軍事家認為很有把握，因此已有人研究抵制的計劃。德國的飛機，現已開始改用蒸汽引擎，因為這種引擎不必“呼吸”，所以不怕“看不見的烟”。蒸汽引擎，尤其是美國人發明的一種，已經試騐，得到很好的成績。引擎中的蒸汽冷了以後，化成水百分之九十九，又可因此生出蒸汽。</p>
<p>這種發展，德人視為甚關重要，所以儘力嚴守秘密。但是波蘭人很關心這事，努力探聽，因此釀成幾年前的索斯諾夫斯基氏巨案。這位波蘭貴人，在德國交際塲中大為活動，探明飛機蒸汽引擎　的秘密。很有聲望的　兩位德國貴婦人，因此喪失她們的頭顱，但秘密終究洩漏了。用蒸汽引擎的飛機，有一種缺憾，那是不能及汽油引擎的　操縱自如，可是也有一個優點，它在本身能散出“看不見的烟”，使攻擊它的用汽油引擎的飛機失其活動力。</p>
<p>這些“光”的使用，都要用着　一種動力機，這是用光的困難。在陣綫附近安置汽油引擎，容易受人轟擊，而損毀的。最簡單的方法，是安置電綫，供給電流，通至用光的戰綫，但是戰綫會時常變動，在放棄一地以前，還得把綫割斷。不過在一個砲臺中用光自衛，却沒有這種困難。法國防禦工程現在都設備各種電氣機關，運用電氣的動力，是隨處都有的。</p>
<p>“聲浪”目下正在狂熱地試騐中。南非洲曾用一種汽笛聲震走成羣結隊的蚱蜢，因此發覺絕大聲浪的頻頻震動，有摧毀的力量。但破壞生物的實力，現在只有實騐室用蛙　跟極小的生物等，作小規模的試騐，除此之外，還沒有試用有效哩。</p>
<p>天空防衛一層，已有幾種值得注意的發展。在最近以前，天空襲擊的死禍，確然很難避免的，今日呢，已有幾種似乎有效的防禦方法了。最有希望的，是一種“看不見的烟”，實在是一種灰屑，它的效用，能窒息飛機的引擎。</p>
<p>汽油引擎必須“呼吸”，倘若空氣滿播着，金屬的灰屑，那引擎便不能“呼吸”，而絕了生命，於是飛機便不能飛行。這是“看不見的光”的原則，由是知道某種金屬的灰屑，如鋁之類，能長留在空中而發明的。這種材料，能用高射砲射出，使空中懸着金屬灰屑的巨幕，飛機飛入其中引擎便會停頓。</p>
<p>還有一種　簡單的防禦法，能止飛機飛行，群便是由汽球　懸鋼絲網在天空。歐戰中意軍曾用這種網　防衛威尼斯。凡善於捕鳥的人，都慣用這法。當時奧國的飛行家見了，禁不住哈哈大笑，但是後來飛機一架一架的　被網擒住，他們也不敢藐視了。用鋼網防衛範圍　有限制的區域，是可能的，英人常說他們預備採用　這個防衛方法。</p>

<h3>英商會年會記</h3>
<p>馬歇爾與皮爾致詞　對中政府善意批評</p>
<p>字林報云、上海英商會、星期四日（十五）在黃浦灘二十七號南會辦公處、舉行第二十二屆年會、主席馬歇爾氏宣稱、一九三六年中國之貿易與商業、實較已往數年中為佳、經數年之不景氣、而獲轉機、今後數年、當可益有希望、上年貿易之轉佳、雖由於歐美兩處小型之旺盛、及中國農田收成之非常良好、而中政府之益得中外信任、其對農村問題之益注意其幣制之穩固、秩序之維持更力、與夫鐵道公路之交通益便、當然亦為種種因素、凡此與一國之貿易、皆有永久之價值、而未可漠視者也、</p>
<p>馬氏繼述上年一年中之中國狀况略謂、兩粤事變與西安事變、賴蔣委員長與諸官長之鎮靜處置、皆得化險為夷、且使分裂多年之兩粤、復受中央節制、此大足表示中政府與其政策之可信任、西南狀况之令人滿意、實為多時所未有、惟北方之狀况、仍屬混沌、雖與日方維持現局、而殊易引起風雲、否則早可淸朗矣、西北共產主義、非俟該地人民經濟生活轉佳、似不易卽吿綏靖、</p>
<p>一九三六年之出口貿易、直至下半年始見轉機、惟對外貿易、仍未達一九三三年一•九五七•○○○、○○○元之數、上年乏總數、為一•六四七•○○○•○○○元、本年一二月間、突見出超、此節殊可歡迎、英國上年、在中國輸出入之貿易中、仍保持其第四位、惟如將帝國之數字列入、則次序將變動如下、（以一百萬元為單位）不列顚帝國四二九元（一七五元）美國與其屬地三八三元、（三七一元）日本三○五元、（二五五元）、德國一八九元、括弧內之數、為各有關係國除去其海外貿易報吿者、</p>
<p>馬氏次述及日人在華走私、使中國關稅所受之重大損失、謂上年損失達五千萬元、此種有組織之大規模行動、至少必得華北日員隱默之贊助、中國緝私處、曾㣘從日武員之要求、緝私隊人員在三哩界限內、不得携帶試器、因此不能應付武裝之走私者、與不能阻止私貨在不設軍備區域內起岸、中國當局雖曾設法阻止私貨由鐵道運輸、但武裝之鮮日人、仍用運貨汽車運輸、故實防不勝防、各方面雖向日政府提出抗議，而皆歸無效、假令日政府願意者、則此種所謂“特殊貿易、不難加以遏止、以一頭等强國、面對顯然侵犯友邦權利之行為、竟漠然置之不顧、實令人百思不解其故也、</p>
<p>英國在華之輸輸入貿易、為美日德三國凌駕、而降居第四位、欲圖補救、不能專賴在華之英商、而亦賴內國之製造家蓋貨價與優惠之賒欠條件、常為獲得定單之重要因素也、因是英政府乃派寇克巴特里克氏代表政府之信用担保局來華、此舉當可大有益於增進對華之貿易也、</p>
<p>中國近年來、對於舶來品之易銷者、自己製造、逐年增多、致外國輸入之數、為之减少、但有數種物品、中國尚不能自製獲利者、銷數視前見增、足似抵補所减之數、工業之發展、與私人建設製造廠、殊有利於國家、政府理應予以鼓勵、但中政府尤其為省政府、現亦從事建設工廠、此舉殊足使私人之振興實業者、為之心冷、而反有不利之影響及於實業之發展、美政府之工廠、非必求獲利、彼私人之工廠、財力不足與抗、殊難與之競爭、若干發展、如公用事業、電燈自來水鐵路等、以公欵興辦、固屬正富但多數國家、皆以為政府若於鼓勵私人振興實業外、而更有所圖實非得計、且不經濟、故皆不自己經營之、實業部農部與全國經濟局、應辦之工作正多、而乃更聞在外國出售中國某種產品之組織、予以資助、似屬不幸、當局雖否認有設立專賣之意、並否認所津貼之機關、乃欲與存立多年之諸公司爭利、然顯已加入商塲、不為顧問者、而為競爭者、其事實終不可掩也、許多國家、皆覺商業宜任其循尋常久已固定之途逕進行、則最易發達、政府若加干涉、或自行經營、則不特不能使之膨脹、反足促之萎縮、如桐油茶葉等產品、大可在產區盡力使之質地改良產、量增加、便利其運輸、减輕其費用、而使農民獲最高之價、此種舉動、足使商業獲益、而得與同類之產品競爭、增高華產之銷數、當局若出以此道、則足有利於國家、而非加入商塲所獲之利可比也、“中國之改革幣制、使匯率得免有大上落、輸出入貿易因是獲益匪减、並望中央銀行改為中央儲備銀行之舉、早日實現、則法幣更將鞏固矣、</p>
<p>次述上年紗業與呢羢業、紗廠在是年之初、經過困難時期、曾有多廠停閉、或短時停工、但至將近年底時已有轉機、現已漸入佳境矣、呢羢業甚見發達、上年又添新廠數家、且尚有計議開設者、此業仍有發展之餘地、中國之工廠、向多設於數大工業中心點、現漸有推廣設立之𧰼、而在原料出產地設立小規模之廠、所出貨可就地銷售、且少發生工潮之虞、目下畢業於專校與大學之技術人才、日見增多、故各業之需機務學識者、今後發展、必須求速、蓋此輩須在政府之事業公用公司與工廠謀取職業也、</p>
<p>馬氏次述、中政府上年曾淸理若干種愆期償付之債欵、使中國信用因以恢復、中國證券、在倫敦市價、為之漲起、此則李滋羅斯爵士等、及張嘉璈君與有力焉、張君不特淸理鐵路債券、且從事擴張已有之鐵路、興建計劃之新鐵路、至於公路、亦積極興築、現全國共有公路一一二•○○○公里、而在一九二一年僅有一○○○公里、此與運輸大有便利、而大足促進全國商業之可能性、他如航空與長途電話、皆有長足之進步、上所述者、皆中國近年來物質上之進步與發達之重大數端也、然物質上之進步、茍無文化上之進步以副之、亦不足為貴、近年來中國大中小學校、已見廣增、學生人數之衆、大非昔比、凡此因素、皆與中國將來之貿易與商業、大有影響、吾人必須準備應付未來之變遷、俾吾人適應時勢也、</p>
<p>上年中政府頒布新律多種、皆志在控制與調節商業、及增加稅收者、如保險法•保險營業法•注冊藥品條例、押欵法等、保險法內多缺點、雖已頒布、尚未實行、聞現正考慮加以修正、註册藥品條例、雖毒品之輸入與出售、有取締之必要、然正當之商人、將頗受累、其中當然不乏缺點、然英商自將遵令註册、竭力盡誠履行之、抵押法曾經英商會小組委員會審愼考慮、其中頗多袒護欠債者之處、故將請當局加以注意、為中外人利益起見、秉公修正、而使債權人獲有相富之保護、印花稅法經修正後、進行殊形滿意、所得稅法已引起許多異議若在全國一律征收低率之所得稅、則無人於原則上有反對之理由、惟目前尚無用當之征收機關、而入項又非一律征稅、僅對薪水收稅、則殊欠公允、有關係各國、現正考慮此稅、施於在華外僑問題、但非俟該法之條例加以修正、及一律實施後、各國在原則上雖不能反對、但恐未必應兀施諸其僑民也、馬民末乃述上年商會所辦之各事、申謝商會小委員會一年中之工作、</p>

<h3>新聞界的敗類允海</h3>
<h3>允海</h3>
<p>新聞事業是神聖且高超的事業，而新聞事業的從業員，也就是純客觀的報吿眞實新聞的這社會的最忠實的僕人。所以，從前有人說新聞記者是“無冕皇帝”，也就是為了新聞記者的對黑暗的無情的暴露的勞動。可是，現在，這一神聖的事業已為這尷尬的社會所沾汚了，那是不消說的。所謂“環境關係”却正是一塊掩着記者的良心的好好的布幕。敢說句公道話的記者，他的厄運是跟着他的業務一起兒來的。關於這些實例，我們從過去許多關於新聞記者的新聞中，已看得出來，這里不想一一列舉。</p>
<p>然而，為了“環境關係”，那還是“被動”；新聞事業尚未被完全吞沒。可是，如今却竟然看到了一部份無恥的記者，出賣了靈魂，辱沒了整個新聞事業。這尤其是，在我們同業的立塲來說，是應該加以嚴厲的苛斥，和道義的制裁的</p>
<p>如今，在上海我們已看到記者公會的議决案了：“北平一部份記者組織赴日偽考察團，本會應嚴予警吿案。議决由本會發表宣言，痛斥該團行動”。不過，這只是上海，其他各地同業還不曾有充份的表示。尤其是在北平的那部份類似“漢奸”的記者以外的有正義感的記者們，是更應該為新聞界的聲譽計，對此輩媚外記者的無恥行為，予以有效的處置。</p>
<p>同時，只是發表宣言“痛斥”仍嫌不夠的，因為這一無恥的行為是有着如下的特殊的意義：</p>
<p>第一，這考察團組織，成立以至經費都由彼方主催和供給，團顧問亦請彼方人士，卽使我們說得小一點，大概在考察歸來以後，歌功頌德幾句至少是不免的；這樣，在新聞記者的道德來說，已是給出賣了。</p>
<p>其次，旣說“日偽考察團”，當然，除了日本之外，還得到“偽滿洲國”去，而不承認“偽國之存在，不特是我當局我國人民的心頭的忿恨的呼聲，卽連國際間都成為一種堅决的信念。這“一部份”的媚外記者，居然張起旗幟赴“偽”考察，這不單止對我同業是一種天大的恥辱，且簡直是喪權辱國的國賊的無恥行為。</p>
<p>由於上述兩點，我們對這一類無恥的敗頻，實不能不有所表示；而這表示應該不止是新聞界的同業，而且凡有正義感的中華民國的人民，也要積極地聲討這一羣新聞界的敗類，媚外的走狗。</p>

<h3>文明圈外</h3>
<p>— 葉家怡</p>
<p>——散步拾記——</p>
<p>他們，他們是並不缺少人類應有的官能，但他們却沒有人類應有的權利。所謂這時代的文明對他們只是更加殘酷！</p>
<p>他們說是生存在這地上，可是上帝並沒有賜給他們一塊容身的土地，祖父是這樣，孩子也是這樣：他們只在一條汚黑發臭的河畔，收拾起一隻破毀的小舟建設他們永生的家。可又並不是像在海上生活着的船家那樣的壯險的人生。</p>
<p>在狹小的船上的家是他們孩子降生的聖地，也是他們祖宗彌留的祭堂，是他們產業（？）的寄托所，也是他們安憇的庭園；這不到四丈長的地方，他們自生到死，就生活在這塊土地裏（不，該不能說是土地）。每天，他們從一個船窗口爬進去，爬出來。父親循着祖父的遺產給他們的命運活下來；孩子的也循着父親的長大來。一代，一代……雖則另一個世界的人們，藉着所謂科學享着人類的幸福，但他們對於這個家再也無法興盛的：甚至還成天愁苦“文明”的進步一天會毀滅了他們的家。</p>
<p>要是有佛陀的心的人初次走過這一羣也呌作人類的洞窟，我不知道他耍如何去苦行？眞的，誰能相信這也是人間的一偶？在附近有高大的洋樓，那裏都是一羣羣西裝革履粉白黛綠的男女在享受着高等的敎育，而河上，每天有許多的商品裝在汽輪上來去着。橫徑過去，還架着一堵壯偉的鐵橋，上午下午都有蟒蛇似的東西尖呌着爬過去，對面，櫛比的房子裏，日夜響着輪子的聲音，人間一切的用品，都很迅速的製造出來。這些，這不是顯現得這世上並不簡樸，淺陋，野蠻。然而為什麼在這大都市的附近仍遺留着一羣遠古的人類昵……</p>
<p>他們，我不能想像是怎樣生活的。可是他們也照樣地生活下，而且也那麼的舒適似的。他們有任何人所不能剝奪的精神的食糧，有文明所不能毀滅的靈魂：在夕陽通紅河面熌成無數條金蛇的傍晚，你們可看到年老的啣着烟桿在他們的天井——船頭的一塊甲板上——優遊暇豫地呼着，身邊縛着吊帶怕跌下河去的孩子蝦蟆似的蹲伏着凝看太陽的光茫；再等到附近悽號的吼聲響定了時，他們的女孩子便會回來聚這麽微末的天倫了，互相的愛憐，使他們都隱蔽了他們的疲勞，苦痛；他們便這樣自己咀嚼苦果生活下來！</p>
<p>都市另一角的文明他們只有在夜間看着為電火輝映得通紅的天半而夢想。從都市回來過的男子講到那邊的女人，商店，車輛，戲館……這會使這些簡單靈魂的人們驚駭得不能相信。那世界離他們是很近的，可是他們到死也不能去過一次。因為他們是生在另一個世界的生物！</p>
<p>簡單的生涯，凑成他們樸實的靈魂。他們不想望生活以外的一切。他們謂只有望孩子們長大來又生下和他一道命運的孩子來！不過，這心懷只是老年們的；靑年的他們，在都市生活過的，受另一批人們虐待過的，也聽到學生們對他們說過的，他們都有一副倔强的心腸，他們伸過拳頭罵過紳士們：“老子總有一天給你們顏色看。”</p>
<p>靜靜的河流每天潮汐着，河畔的居民的血汗漸漸枯涸了，牠都流入這黑膩的河流去。一批一批的人死的多了，河流的血液也積聚多了。這個不久的將來，靑年的他們都相信會看到血浪的高潮怒捲起來的……</p>
<p>——總有一天……他們都這麼想。</p>
<h3>古城散記</h3>
<p>— 余尼</p>
<p>城老了。</p>
<p>——舊世紀底尾巴。是古墓前底碑石底沉寂，無聲地枯萎了。是孤獨的老人底內心的傷感，將永遠為抑鬱所蛀蝕。是暗綠色的汚水的陰溝。是永遠泛不起一串狂笑的死水。</p>
<p>一些織不成夢的孤寂的游絲，永遠地像輕烟地飄浮，然而像回憶底濃密地重來。然而也像回憶漸漸地褪色。下面是它們一些零亂的痕跡：（一些最微細的，幾乎瞧不着的。）</p>
<p>㊀杉木洲</p>
<p>春來了。</p>
<p>在這永遠的枯寂的沙洲上，那靑靑的草，被微風摩撫得可憐的笑了。</p>
<p>遼闊：</p>
<p>沙洲沿着大江蜿蜓，開展到遠遠地，遠遠地，到天邊。</p>
<p>被春忘記的茅草的矮屋子，雜亂地在遼闊里點出了渺小。矮矮地蹲着，像一個怕羞的女人，遮掩着自己衣上底漏洞，然而誰注意呢？</p>
<p>幾棵楊柳站在寂寥里，因為年年江水底汜濫，在那樹幹上留下了在水中久浸了的白跡。</p>
<p>這幾棵樹下，是槍斃犯人的老地方。——那一付透着“殺氣”的凄涼的陰鬱，是一個沉重的惡夢，永遠地爬上了，貼上了，這邊近的矮屋里的人們底心頭</p>
<p>㊁砲營</p>
<p>過去是砲營，然而如今荒蕪了。圍墻的磚石，抹一層風雨的凋零，縫隙里的野草，◻◻地。門洞，像城門底一樣大，然而門早已給誰偷去了。</p>
<p>里面是一些要飯的安身地，◻雜的破碎，集成了一些茅蓬，腐臭將永遠封鎖在這里。在那空地的中間，還矗然地立了兩座砲身，已經沒有一些能耐了，黃色的銹，繡一身花紋。沉默地給人們當作竹竿來晒衣了。</p>
<p>春天到這里就爛了變作脚下的汚泥</p>
<p>什麼都像爛泥一樣了。</p>
<p>沒有春風。沒有朝陽。沒有歡悅。沒有感傷。</p>
<p>沉默地無感覺地爛了。</p>
<p>㊂白衣凸</p>
<p>白衣凸在西門外。</p>
<p>在滿目都是纍纍的墳包的山坡上，同樣是一些矮矮的茅屋，然而，這可不同了。</p>
<p>這里是神秘的：</p>
<p>年靑的小姑娘，半老的徐娘，一身潔凈的衣褲，倚着柴扇用手招着行人呢！</p>
<p>很便宜呢，——幾十個銅板，就可以抱一個到懷里來。</p>
<p>然而，那些屋里的男人，縮在黑角里把兩條眉毛縫起來嘆氣。旱烟袋或許是紙烟頭，在黑暗黑里亮着小小的紅點。</p>
<p>生活是一包辛酸。</p>
<p>一些織不成夢的游絲，永遠地像輕烟地飄浮。——</p>
<p>一些微細的不成音節的拍子，在喃喃地咀咒。——</p>
<p>一些被回憶所拋棄的抑鬱，將永遠結成一隻無邊的惡夢，來驚醒海燕的歌聲，的讚揚。</p>
<p>城老了。</p>
<p>——舊世紀底尾巴。</p>

<h3>Central Instruction of Six Measures, Sichuan Authorities Decide to Implement</h3>
<p>He Guoguang Continues Talks with Liu Xiang, Issues Statement to Reporters, Deng Hanxiang Also Expresses Affirmative Stance</p>
<p>[Chengdu] On the 16th, He Guoguang of the Provisional Headquarters gave a written statement to visiting reporters from various newspapers, saying, "I have always believed that the longer we meet and the clearer our mutual understanding, the more agile and efficient our work will be. I have not been to Chengdu for several months, so I came specifically to meet with Chairman Liu, the military leaders, the heads of various institutions, and local figures, hoping to achieve agile work results. As for your inquiries about Chairman Liu's acceptance of the central government's six proposed measures, to put it bluntly, the so-called six measures are very fair and ordinary. I think Chairman Liu will be happy to do them. Chairman Liu personally told me yesterday that he has expressed his acceptance and decided to implement them. So, you can look at the actual performance. In short, the connection between the central government and the local authorities is like the torso and limbs of a human body. We only hope to strengthen this connection further, so that the country becomes healthier day by day, and Sichuan becomes brighter day by day. Only under the unified command of the supreme leader can we truly achieve the goal of revival and resistance to aggression." (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>

In the afternoon, the reporters went to the provincial government to visit Deng Hanxiang and inquire about the central government's six proposed measures. Deng said that the six measures proposed by the central government were based on the actual situation in Sichuan Province and pointed out the matters that Sichuan Province should handle. This is only a normal work instruction and cannot be regarded as so-called conditions. Chairman Liu will naturally be happy to comply. It has been gradually realized during the day. Also, when reporters visited He Guoguang on the morning of the 16th, Liu Xiang and Pan Wenhua, commander of the 23rd Army, also came to visit, and they had a very pleasant conversation. They then went to the Qingyang Palace to visit the goods exhibition. At 5 p.m., He went to the provincial government to attend a joint banquet hosted by the heads of various departments of the provincial government and the heads of various departments of the Pacification Headquarters, and invited the army and division commanders in the province to attend.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Amendment to National Funeral Law</h3>
<p>Regarding Postponement of Ratification of Two Labor Conventions</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan held its 99th regular meeting on the morning of the 16th, with 68 members including Wu Kaixian present. Deputy President Ye presided over the meeting, with Secretary-General Liang Han Cao. Matters for discussion: ㊀ Amendment to the National Funeral Law. Resolution: Passed according to the review report of the Legislative Committee. ㊁ Amendment to the National Funeral Cemetery Regulations. Resolution: Passed after amendment according to the review report of the Legislative Committee. ㊂ Convention on Paid Annual Leave. ㊃ Convention on Reduction of Working Hours in Public Works. Resolution: Both of the above cases were passed according to the review reports of the Foreign Affairs, Labor Law, and Two Committees. Both cases were postponed for ratification for the following reasons: The Convention on Paid Annual Leave aims to allow workers to enjoy at least six working days of special leave in addition to their regular annual leave. This is generally in line with Article 17 of the Factory Law of our country, which stipulates that workers who have worked in a factory for more than one year should have seven days of special leave. However, the Convention also stipulates that young workers and apprentices under the age of 16 should enjoy at least twelve working days of special leave. This point is not yet stipulated in the Factory Law of our country. Moreover, according to the opinion of the Ministry of Industry, the provisions of the Factory Law of our country regarding special leave have not yet been implemented in practice. Therefore, the Convention was resolved by the Yuan to be postponed for ratification. The Convention on Reduction of Working Hours in Public Works aims to promote the 40-hour work week in government-funded or subsidized engineering undertakings. Considering the current situation in our country, it is still difficult to implement. Therefore, it was also resolved that it should be postponed for ratification.

(Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] The full picture of the previous puppet Chahar military and political meeting has been revealed as follows: ㊀ Decided not to abandon the six counties of Chahar. ㊁ During both the September 18th and January 28th Incidents, a certain party did not suffer great losses. However, when Jin Xianzhang revolted last year, 20 important officials, including a major, died every day, so they are extremely resentful. As for their military deployment, certain regular army elites are participating, and the battle situation will be more intense than before. It is heard that their route of advance will be to attack Xinghe in eastern Suiyuan through Daqinggou and Nanhongjian, so the puppet troops are now actively concentrating there. In addition, many automobiles of the Donglu and Wenlin companies have been detained, and civilian carts have been concentrated in Dolon for use. Because a certain railway in the Rehe area can directly reach Dolon, they are now first transporting supplies and ammunition. Once the war breaks out, relying on convenient transportation, it will not be difficult for their regular army to arrive at the front line immediately. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Major Kai, an officer of the Japanese military, said that the military movements in Chahar are of a rotation nature. The armies inside and outside the pass have no intention of supporting any new actions by that side. The situation in Mongolia is currently being rectified, and many rumors are untrue. The cadres and staff officers of the military are planning to form an inspection group to inspect Zhangbei, Suiyuan, and Mongolia. Hashimoto is scheduled to return to Tianjin on the 17th. The timing of convening a meeting of military officers is undecided. If it is not necessary, it may be conveyed by order. The intention to invest in and extend the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway to the east has been largely decided. Yasukawa exchanged opinions with influential figures in the company, and most of them agreed. After inspecting North China and contacting Tashiro and Horiuchi, he will go to Nanjing to visit Chinese dignitaries and inquire about their true intentions. If there are no obstacles, they will proceed according to the plan proposed by the military. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Takeo Imai said that Chahar and eastern Suiyuan are currently very peaceful. The recent negotiations on the two issues of developing the Longyan Iron Mine and building the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway have been going smoothly, but specific measures have not yet been decided.

<h3>Anecdotes of the Yunnan Journey (1)</h3>
<p>— Beijuan</p>
<p>This Gyeong-Dian Highway touring, both the departure and arrival locations, were fully prepared beforehand. The eight provinces passed through were also notified half a year in advance, so the needs of the trip were fully met. On April 5th, we departed from the Lizhi Society. There were 18 large No. 3 trucks, purchased by the Economic Association, each costing about 8,000 yuan, and the equipment was quite good. Starting from No. 4, they were purchased by the Anhui Provincial Highway Bureau and were made in the United States. The group was divided into five teams. Group leader Chu Minyi, a Central Committee member, was the only person among the Central Committee members suitable for leading the trip. Deputy group leader Dr. Wu Liande was also a world-renowned medical scientist. Back in the late Qing Dynasty, Mr. Wu hosted the eradication of the plague in Harbin, Northeast China, which was highly praised by both China and foreign countries. After a separation of 30 years, we met again in the new capital, and his demeanor was still the same. Mr. Wu's way of maintaining his health is commendable. Vehicle No. 15 in the procession was a vehicle used by an American businessman to solicit business for diesel fuel. Vehicle No. 16 was a vegetable oil car driven by Zhang Shidai from Sichuan. The five team leaders were: Lü Hongqi, Pei Jian, Dai ZhanKui, Liu Jue, Ling Anhan, Zhang Dengyi, Wu Zelin, Chen Shiquan, and Wu Shilin. The situation of the first day of departure was recorded in detail in newspapers in Gyeong-Shanghai and other places. Because the Highway Office of the Transportation Committee had already printed a travel guide for each section of the highway in February of this year, which included a general description of the route, traffic conditions, a summary of scenic spots, products along the route, a brief itinerary, and an estimate of travel expenses, all with charts and instructions, it was extremely easy to check. Therefore, what individuals saw was less than one-tenth of the total. As for the daily itinerary and living arrangements, Mr. Lü Hongqi of the Central News Agency described them in great detail. Newspapers in Gyeong-Shanghai, such as Mr. Shen Jicang of the News, Mr. Wang Songnian of the Dagong News, Mr. Gao Xianggao of the Shishi News, Mr. Zhao Muru of the China Daily, and Mr. Xu Zhaorong, a reporter from the English Department of the Central News Agency, and Mr. Nie Shizhang of the Central Daily News, all worked hard to take photos, record and type, using their hands and eyes. Therefore, all places know the details of this tour. The reporter added to the procession, but there was almost no material to grab for hard news. Also, there were many party and government officials with rich knowledge in the same car, as well as experts from academic groups, each with their own expertise. What the reporter knew was only a very thin layer, so he hardly dared to write. Helplessly, he could only record the various scenes along the way, unsystematic and fragmented things, as a tribute to anecdotes.</p>
<p>On the first day (April 5th), after leaving the Zhonghua Gate, we passed through Xiaoxing Town and the Economic Association's mulberry field, which was guided by Italian experts Dr. Manli and his daughter three years ago. The test was very successful, and it is now gradually developing. Further west to the vicinity of Daiqiao Town, there is the Overseas Chinese Fruit and Livestock Farm. Slightly to the south, there is the cattle farm run by Vice Chairman Feng Huanchang. There are now more than 170 head of cattle, and milk production is very high every day, and it is still expanding. Mr. Feng's ambition is to enable every rural family in the area to raise a cow in the future, which is really a good rural sideline. The land price in the area is only five yuan per mu, and it is bound to be profitable to cultivate fruit trees. Mr. Wei Tingsheng, a member of the Legislative Yuan and an economic expert, told me that he and several friends have already bought land and are trying to do it. Further east to the vicinity of Jiangning Town, the area is a future cultural district. Nanjing Middle School has already purchased land and built houses there, and Northeast University has also moved there, and its middle school department has been fully equipped and has started teaching. At noon that day, we arrived in Wuhu, and everyone had lunch at the Anle Hotel, hosted by Mr. Liu Yiyan, Director of the Anhui Construction Department. Also present were Mr. and Mrs. Zhao Zukang, Director of the Highway Office of the Economic Association, and reporters stationed in Wuhu, Mr. Xu Shanbai, Mr. Wang Licheng, and Mr. He Sanwei. At 2 p.m., we left Wuhu. Mr. He Sui, Chairman of the Military Committee of the Legislative Yuan, proposed to visit Mount Jingting when we arrived in Xuancheng. Also in the same car were two geography experts, Professors Hu Huanyong and Yan Deyi of National Central University, who lectured on the river water sources, geological layers, and types of rocks along the way, which the whole car was very interested in. Dr. Pei Jian, the deputy team leader in the same car, is an authority on contemporary botanical research. Everyone asked Mr. Pei about the grass and plants they saw. At 4:45, we arrived in Xuancheng and divided into two groups, one group to visit Jingting, and Secretary Shen Yuanming of the Chinese Engineering Society was inspired to compose poetry, and Mr. He Sui jointly wrote the sentence, He chanted, "Pulling green and spreading gold to guide guests, ten thousand villages of cloud brocade embrace Xuancheng," and Shen continued, "The scenery of Mount Jingting is so clear, it is worthy of the first journey of the long march." Then, in the dim twilight, we returned to Xuancheng Middle School for dinner and lodging. The dormitory was a classroom, and everyone set up camp beds and made their own beds. They packed up at night and rolled them up in the morning. This was because most of the people were graduates of specialized schools above the Chinese and foreign levels, and they had good self-governing ability. On the second day (April 6th), from Xuancheng to She County, there was a fork in the road to overseas Chinese, and a poor people's relief institute was built 70 miles away from Xuan. We had lunch in the garden of She County Middle School. The pickled vegetables were all local products, simple and delicious. Hundreds of flowers were in full bloom in the garden, and the air was fresh. We were very happy to have a short break in the midst of fatigue. In the afternoon, we passed through Tangkou and turned into Mount Huang. We were assigned to live in the Tiandu Cultural Relics Society. The general director, Mr. Xuebaixin, invited everyone to Tangquan Bath. The bathhouse was well-equipped, with sand on the bottom of the pool, which had a natural flavor. The bath could accommodate ten people. We took turns bathing. Mr. Wei Tingsheng, Mr. He Sui, Mr. Pei Jian, Mr. Shi Weixin, Mr. Hu Huanyong, Mr. Yan Deyi, and I were in the same pool. Mr. Bai loves hot springs and advocated taking several baths. Mr. Wei was humorous and said that his humble name, Wei Tingsheng, can also be read as Ting Weisheng. Everyone laughed together. Someone said that we are all naked and see each other without a thread, which shows that we are good friends. In the evening, everyone divided up to visit Ciguang Temple, Maoting, and Wenshu Temple. Professor Yao Wencan, the owner of the Tiandu Cultural Relics Society, sent a telegram from Beijing to Mount Huang to Zheng Yuejun and He Sui to ask for paintings, and prepared paper and brushes in advance. He Zheng cooperated to create a "Jingting Spring Scenery Picture" and jointly inscribed a poem: "The peach blossoms are burning brightly, the fairies are envious of the long journey in the same car, the myriad purples and thousands of reds cannot be seen enough, the mountain scenery is best in Xuancheng." On the third day (April 7th), it drizzled, which was not bad for sprinkling water to clear the road for those in the dust. Passing through She County, Tunxi, Wan'an, and arriving at Qimen, Tunxi is a green tea producing area, and Qimen is a black tea producing area. The Qimen Production Area Management Office of the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Committee hosted lunch and presented gifts. In the afternoon, we left Anhui Province at Zhangwangmiao Station and embarked on the journey to Jiangxi Province. The mountains were full of red and purple azaleas, which complemented each other beautifully. At 6 p.m., we arrived at Fuliang County (the riverbank of Jingdezhen). We walked across the pontoon bridge to the Chamber of Commerce. Everyone set up beds in the Guangda Building Hall. Because there were so many people and the journey was a bit tiring, snoring broke out at night, and someone even talked loudly in their sleep, causing everyone to be awakened from their dreams. The next morning, we asked Deputy Group Leader Dr. Wu if there was a way to prevent the snoring from spreading. Wu replied very simply, just close your mouth and breathe through your nose, and there will naturally be no snoring. Why not put a mask of antibacterial cotton on your mouth, so that breathing through the nose will not burden the throat. I remember that I used to be a little chubby, and my wife was always disgusted by my snoring. At that time, there was no way to suppress it. Recently, my body has been slightly smaller, and I don't snore as much as before. Now that I have Dr. Wu's method, I might as well introduce it to snoring comrades. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Gan Haiquan Case Was Tried in Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>[Zhenjiang] The appeal case of Gan Haiquan's affair with his sister-in-law and murder of his brother, which caused a sensation in the capital, was heard in the fifth branch of the Zhenjiang Jiangsu High Court on the 16th. Court President Wang Jian, judge Chen Zhenchun, Zhou Baochu, and female prosecutor Wang Yuxiu opened the third court. However, because the audience was crowded and the order was chaotic, the trial was changed to the sixth court. However, the part about the affair was still considered to involve morality and was forbidden to the audience. Gan Haiquan and Jiang Shuzhen both absolutely denied the fact of adultery. Gan Haiquan also only believed that the murder of his brother was a temporary mental disorder and had no intention of killing his brother. Gan Hailan also stated in court that he did not want to pursue the matter deeply, considering the past friendship between husband and wife and brothers, and requested a lenient judgment. After repeated debates by the lawyers Wang Long and Chen Yaodong hired by Gan Haiquan and Jiang Shuzhen, and Gan Hailan's lawyer Fu Zhulin, the court debate ended, and the judgment was scheduled for the 22nd. Gan Haiquan was returned to custody, and Jiang Shuzhen was released on the original bail. The court adjourned at 8 p.m. Gan Hailan went to the detention center to visit Gan Haiquan and rebuked him with righteousness. Gan Haiquan expressed remorse and requested assistance during his imprisonment. Gan Hailan did not express withdrawal. (16th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Question of Egypt's Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>The conference discussing the abolition of consular jurisdiction in Egypt is being held in Montreux, Switzerland. Although the future outcome cannot yet be predicted, judging from the harmonious atmosphere in the meeting place in the past few days, considerable results are expected in the future. According to foreign news reports a few days ago, the General Committee of the conference has decided to completely abolish the consular jurisdiction enjoyed by various countries in Egypt. The important issue now being discussed is how to abolish it concretely. According to the views of the British and French sides, the abolition of consular jurisdiction in Egypt must be done gradually, so that foreigners and foreign companies residing in Egypt have sufficient time and opportunity to prepare for adapting to the new situation after the abolition of consular jurisdiction. France proposed an 18-year transition period, while Egypt advocated a 12-year limit. The two sides have not yet resolved the dispute and are awaiting a decision by the conference. From the general situation of the Montreux conference, although Egypt's consular jurisdiction can be abolished in principle in the near future, the integrity of territorial sovereignty and the independence of the judiciary still need to wait more than ten years to be fully achieved.</p>
<p>Although the consular jurisdiction enjoyed by various countries in Egypt cannot be practically abolished immediately, this recognition of complete abolition in principle is of considerable importance to the integrity of Egyptian sovereignty. Because Egypt has gone through many stages of struggle to be liberated from the status of a colony of the British Empire and become the current independent country. In 1922, the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty nominally made Egypt an independent country. (Because the treaty contained five extremely important reservations proposed by Britain, Egypt was still a British colony in practice.) After the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Alliance Treaty last year, Britain withdrew most of its troops and gave up certain privileges, and Egypt achieved a certain degree of independence. The recent Montreux conference also decided in principle to completely abolish consular jurisdiction. This is naturally of considerable help to Egypt's independent status and the integrity of its sovereignty. However, if Egypt wants to achieve true independence and the integrity of judicial power, it certainly still needs great efforts and continuous struggle.</p>
<p>From the development of the Montreux conference and the abolition of consular jurisdiction in Egypt, we cannot help but think of this illegal system that exists in our own country. The implementation of consular jurisdiction in China has a history of several decades. There were previously 19 countries, including Britain, the United States, France, and Japan, that enjoyed this illegal right. Although Germany, Austria, Russia, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Mexico have successively given up their rights (recently, due to the civil war in Spain, there are no formal diplomatic and consular personnel stationed in China, so their overseas citizens have been placed under the jurisdiction of Chinese courts), most countries still enjoy this privilege and refuse to give it up. Although the reasons they hold have been repeatedly refuted by our country, they always delay and do not allow us to recover it. Under such circumstances, we really have no good way but to adopt the method of automatically abolishing consular jurisdiction. Recently, the Shanghai Bar Association and various public groups have listed many reasons and petitioned the government to automatically recover consular jurisdiction. We very much hope that the government can take action on this matter. Although in our semi-colonial country, there are many things that are more harmful to the integrity of our country's sovereignty than this consular jurisdiction, and which urgently need our government and the people to work together to struggle, if we can recover consular jurisdiction as soon as possible, then taking one step is better than not taking it.</p>
<h3>The Montreux Conference Discusses the Egyptian Judicial System</h3>
<p>The Issue of the Transition Period Has Not Been Compromised, Italy and France Ask Their Governments for Instructions</p>
<p>⊙ Montreux The General Affairs Committee of the conference on the abolition of consular jurisdiction in Egypt will meet today to discuss the judicial system of the Egyptian courts and organize a subcommittee to continue to review this issue. It is scheduled to meet again on Sunday. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>⊙ Montreux What was discussed at the conference on the abolition of consular jurisdiction in Egypt yesterday was entirely the issue of the transition period for completing the procedure for abolishing consular jurisdiction. Although the opinions of the representatives were closer than expected, they were still not consistent, so no compromise was reached. The meeting continued today and then adjourned to allow for further study. Britain, Italy, Portugal, and the South African Republic have supported Egypt's proposal to have a 12-year transition period. It is said that Sweden and Denmark also have no objection to this. However, Italy, Greece, and Belgium support France's 18-year proposal. The representatives of France and Italy have now asked their governments for instructions. Until this issue is resolved, other important issues will not be able to proceed. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>⊙ Montreux The International Conference on the Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction in Egypt today continued to discuss the organizational issues of the Mixed Courts and passed several articles of the draft submitted by the Egyptian delegation. The most important of these is that the president of the Court of Appeal should be a foreigner, and that of the Foreign Mixed Courts, the Foreign Judge should be the Chief Judge, and vice versa, for the French Mixed Courts with Egyptian nationals, one of the Egyptian National Judges should be the Chief Judge. The allocation of the number of judges of the Mixed Courts will be submitted for discussion when a compromise is reached on the implementation period of the transitional measures. (According to the delegation of Egypt, the implementation period of the transitional measures should be set at 12 years, and the delegation of the United Kingdom, the United States, Denmark, and Portugal all expressed their support. The French delegation advocated setting it at 18 years, divided into three stages, each stage counting as six years, and the delegations of Italy and Belgium supported it.)

<h3>League of Nations Advisory Committee on Social Issues</h3>
<p>Japanese Representative Appointed Vice Chairman</p>
<p>[Geneva] At the current session of the Advisory Committee on Social Issues of the League of Nations, it was originally planned to elect Yokohama, the Japanese Consul-General stationed in Geneva, as Chairman, but because Japan is not a member of the League of Nations, the Danish representative was elected instead. Afterwards, Japanese people here expressed dissatisfaction. The committee continued to meet this morning and elected Yokohama as Vice Chairman. League of Nations officials believed that the purpose of this move was because there was considerable opposition to Japan when the Chairman was elected yesterday, so it was used to express sympathy to Japan, so as not to cause displeasure on the Japanese side.

<h3>National Attention to Health in Japan</h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Begins Survey: Physical Build of Youths Nationwide</p>
<p>[Tokyo] During the Hirota Cabinet era, the government recognized improving the national physique as the foundation for revitalizing national strength and advocated for the establishment of a Ministry of Health. With the formation of the Hayashi Cabinet, policies for stabilizing national life were established, and the improvement of the national physique was promoted simultaneously. The Ministries of Education and Interior, along with other relevant ministries, jointly studied concrete measures. The Ministry of Education has now decided to implement the first step, namely, the "Health Facility Expenses for Students" proposed by the Ministry of Education have been approved by the 70th Diet. These funds will be used to conduct physical examinations of youths nationwide over a period of five years, at a cost of 150,000 yen. The survey will assess the health, strength, and activity levels of youths both in and out of school, and research appropriate concrete methods for improving the national physique, studying the results.

<h3>Cabinet to Establish Planning Agency</h3>
<p>Draft Content Submitted to Cabinet Meeting</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Today's regular Cabinet meeting began at 9:45 AM at the Prime Minister's official residence. Chief Cabinet Secretary Ohashi presented an outline of the proposed Cabinet Planning Agency (tentative name). (Note: The establishment of the Planning Agency is one of the current Cabinet's important policies and is scheduled to be set up before the special Diet session as a national policy integration mechanism.) He personally explained in detail the content and history of the proposal. Ministers Yuuki, Yamazaki, Kawara, and Kodama questioned the differences between the proposal and the four-ministry conference during the previous cabinet era, as well as whether to establish an economic conference as an affiliated body. As a result, the draft proposed by Chief Secretaries Ohashi and Kawagoe was generally approved, and it was decided that each cabinet member would further review it before discussing it again at the cabinet meeting on the 19th, formally determining the content of the Planning Agency proposal.

<p>[Tokyo] The outline of the national policy integration agency establishment plan proposed by Ohashi is as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ The name will be the Cabinet Planning Agency. ㊁ The Cabinet Planning Agency will be under the management of the Prime Minister and will be responsible for the investigation and planning of important policies. It will also have a certain degree of advisory power regarding the budget formulation for important policies. ㊂ The Cabinet Planning Agency will focus on expanding and strengthening the existing Cabinet Research Bureau's organization and authority, without integrating the Resources Bureau, Legislation Bureau, Statistics Bureau, Information Committee, and other agencies under the Cabinet's jurisdiction. ㊃ The Cabinet Planning Agency will have one president and one vice-president, each. The president will be a personally appointed official, and the vice-president will be an appointed official. ㊄ The Cabinet Planning Agency will have several full-time secretaries and administrative officials. It will recruit personnel from the private sector through methods such as revising the appointment regulations. ㊅ The current participation and specialized committees of the Research Bureau will be abolished. ㊆ The Cabinet Planning Agency will adopt a collegial system. However, the establishment of "departments" or "bureaus" for important policies will be studied separately. ㊇ The Cabinet Planning Agency should hold liaison committees or adopt other methods to liaise with various ministries at any time, even strengthening the degree of contact. ㊈ A permanent economic conference will serve as an advisory body to the Prime Minister.

<h3>US Maritime Workers' Strike Revived</h3>
<p>"Roosevelt" Initiates, Various Mail Ships Respond</p>
<p>[New York] The American maritime workers' strike has now been revived, and the earliest initiators this time were the crew members of the Dollar Steamship Lines' mail ship "President Roosevelt," who suddenly announced a sit-down strike a few days ago, causing the labor unrest to spread again. Furthermore, the American Telegraphists' Union has also declared a general strike against the ships of the International Mercantile Marine Company, and 500 crew members of the mail ship "California" have also announced a strike in response to the crew members of the "Roosevelt." Among the ships affected and whose voyages have been suspended, in addition to the "Roosevelt's" European voyage on Wednesday being temporarily canceled, the "American Banker," originally scheduled to depart for Europe today, has also been unable to do so. The "Manhattan," which arrived in the United States from Europe today, is also likely to be involved. Furthermore, 250 passengers on the "Roosevelt" have now transferred to the "Berengaria" or other ships for departure. It is reported that the purpose of the "Roosevelt's" crew members' strike this time is to force the company to dismiss nine engine room workers who did not express sympathy during the previous strike.

<h3>Lynching Illegal</h3>
<p>US House Passes Bill</p>
<p>[Washington] Today, the US House of Representatives voted 276 to 119 to define lynching as a violation of federal law. Lynching in the United States originated with Lynch, a form of torture specifically designed for blacks or other minority races. The common method of execution is to hang the victim from a tree and burn them to death. The bill to ban this form of lynching was introduced by New York Democratic Congressman Gavagan and stipulates that local police or police chiefs who allow crowds to seize prisoners in their custody and put them to death may be sentenced to imprisonment or heavy fines. Members of the crowd who participate in such illegal lynchings are also guilty of the same crime. After this bill was introduced, members of Congress from southern states strongly opposed it, as people in the southern states have deeper prejudices against blacks. It is said that even if this bill is introduced in the Senate, it will still be difficult to pass. (15th, Reuters, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>US Naval and Air Force Pacific Grand Maneuver</h3>
<p>Over 100 Warships Departed Yesterday, Soviet Union Asks US for Cooperation to Strengthen Their Naval Presence in the Far East</p>
<p>⊙ San Diego, USA The US Navy suddenly sailed out to sea today to conduct exercises. All light cruisers sailed out first at 8:00 AM, with the destroyer fleet led by Rear Admiral Forneau bringing up the rear.

<p>[London] Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky hosted a banquet at the embassy yesterday afternoon for Davis, the US representative to the World Sugar Conference, to discuss matters. According to naval sources, Maisky requested cooperation from the United States to develop the Soviet Navy in order to create a strong force in the Far East. It is said that Maisky told Davis that the Soviet Union has already developed a plan to build a naval base in Murmansk (a Soviet port in northern Russia that provides access to the Arctic Ocean) to provide a more convenient route for the Soviet naval fleet sailing to the Atlantic Ocean. Later, after the completion of the Northern Sea Route through the Kara Sea, the Soviet fleet can pass through the Kara Sea via the Arctic Ocean, through the Bering Strait and Vladivostok to the Far East. However, up to now, if the Soviet European naval fleet wants to be transferred to the Far East, it must pass through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean. In the future, if the Arctic Ocean route is built, the voyage can be greatly shortened, and the Soviet Navy's position in the Far East will inevitably be strengthened as a result. But to achieve this goal, large-scale construction must be carried out. Therefore, Maisky specifically requested Davis to provide cooperation from American technicians and facilitate the export of raw materials from the United States to the Soviet Union. (15th, Havas, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky hosted a banquet for Davis the other day, and it is rumored that their discussion concerned the development of the Soviet Navy. US naval sources here have denied this, stating that Maisky merely informed Davis of the progress of naval talks between Britain and the Soviet Union and explained the reasons for the two Soviet claims: ㊀ to build 10,000-ton Class A cruisers, and ㊁ to accept the restrictions stipulated in the London Naval Treaty only after Japan respects the qualitative restrictions.

<h3>Date of Meeting Between European Fascist Leaders Not Yet Confirmed</h3>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the upcoming meeting between German leader Hitler and Mussolini, well-informed sources say that this meeting can only be held after German Foreign Minister Neurath, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, and Aviation Minister Goering come here for consultations to prepare in advance. However, at present, Neurath and others have not yet definitively decided to visit Italy. Therefore, it is even more impossible to determine on what date Hitler and Mussolini will meet.

<h3>Six-Year Plan to Mediate the Spanish Civil War</h3>
<p>Proposed by Churchill of Britain, French Newspapers Believe It Is Difficult to Achieve</p>
<p>[Paris] Johnson, the Archbishop of Canterbury of Britain, arrived here today after observing in Spain. He said that the outcome of the Spanish warring factions can be predicted if there is no assistance from foreign countries, because the National Army leader Franco would be doomed to failure without the supply of foreign manpower and military supplies. Johnson was dismayed by Churchill's recent proposal in the House of Commons to mediate the Spanish Civil War, because the government forces have now adopted a winning strategy, and mediation would benefit the National Army. Earlier, Churchill had proposed that the UK, France, Germany, Russia and Italy suggest resolving the Spanish Civil War, with the solution to be established in three phases over six years. The first phase is a ceasefire with no death penalty except for political assassination. The second phase is the organization of a mixed government of political elements, with no participants in this war allowed to participate. The third phase is the restoration of the parliamentary system and the establishment of a democratic government. (15th, Reuters, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>The Terrors of Future Wars (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>New Scientific Methods of Killing</p>
<p>But with any blessing, there is a curse. If the sky has this smokescreen, then the planes defending themselves will not be able to operate. However, military experts believe that this method is very reliable, so some people have already started researching plans to counter it. German planes have now begun to switch to steam engines, because these engines do not need to "breathe," so they are not afraid of "invisible smoke." Steam engines, especially the kind invented by Americans, have been tested and have achieved good results. After the steam in the engine cools, it turns into water, 99 percent of which can be used to generate steam again.</p>
<p>The Germans consider this development very important, so they are doing their best to keep it secret. But the Poles are very concerned about this matter and are working hard to find out, which led to the Sosnowski case a few years ago. This Polish nobleman was very active in German social circles and discovered the secret of airplane steam engines. Two highly respected German noblewomen lost their heads because of this, but the secret was ultimately leaked. The disadvantage of airplanes using steam engines is that they cannot be as maneuverable as gasoline engines, but they also have an advantage: they can emit "invisible smoke," making gasoline-powered airplanes attacking them lose their mobility.</p>
<p>The use of these "lights" requires a power source, which is the difficulty of using light. It is easy for gasoline engines placed near the front lines to be bombarded and destroyed. The simplest method is to install electric wires to supply current to the light-using front lines, but the front lines are constantly changing, and the wires must be cut off before abandoning a location. However, there is no such difficulty in using light for self-defense in a fort. French defense projects are now equipped with various electrical mechanisms, and the power of electricity is available everywhere.</p>
<p>"Sound waves" are currently being tested frantically. South Africa once used a siren sound to drive away swarms of locusts, thus discovering the destructive power of frequent vibrations of extremely loud sound waves. However, the ability to destroy living things is currently only being tested on a small scale in laboratories using frogs and very small creatures, and has not yet been effectively tested in practical applications.</p>
<p>In terms of sky defense, there have been several noteworthy developments. Until recently, the death toll from sky attacks was indeed difficult to avoid. Today, however, there are several seemingly effective defense methods. The most promising is an "invisible smoke," which is actually a type of ash that can suffocate airplane engines.</p>
<p>Gasoline engines must "breathe." If the air is filled with metallic ash, then the engine cannot "breathe" and will die, and the airplane will not be able to fly. This is the principle of "invisible light." It was discovered that the ash of certain metals, such as aluminum, can remain in the air for a long time. This material can be fired from anti-aircraft guns, creating a giant screen of metallic ash suspended in the air. When an airplane flies into it, the engine will stop.</p>
<p>There is also a simple defense method that can stop airplanes from flying: suspending wire mesh in the sky from balloons. The Italian army used this type of net to defend Venice in the European War. Anyone skilled at catching birds is familiar with this method. At the time, Austrian aviators couldn't help but laugh, but later, as airplanes were caught in the nets one after another, they dared not despise it. It is possible to defend limited areas with steel mesh. The British often say that they are preparing to adopt this defense method.</p>

<h3>The Activities of the "East Hebei" and Tianjin Traitors</h3>
<p>Disgruntled Military Men and Politicians Form Pro-Foreign Organizations, Contact Bandits, and Recruit Ignorant People in an Attempt to Revolt. The Authorities are Taking Measures to Eliminate the East Hebei Puppet Organization</p>
<p>North China Correspondence from Beijing: Although the situation in North China has appeared somewhat stable on the surface in recent months, in reality, the secret activities of traitors have not diminished at all. The "East Hebei" area is close to Beijing and Tianjin, and many disgruntled politicians and military men use it as a base of operations. The headquarters is in Tianjin. Hao Peng recently secretly arrived in Beijing from Changchun and went to Tongxian on the 9th to report on his trip to Changchun. It is said that Hao's trip to Changchun was on the orders of the traitor Yin Rugeng to make contact with the Japanese Kwantung Army. The content was to request the puppet Manchukuo to provide "East Hebei" with military supplies in exchange for economic assistance, with the intention of forming a "Japan-Manchukuo-East Hebei Association" to meet the needs of the puppet organization's military expansion. Bai Jianwu also had contact with the traitor Yin and signed a mutual assistance treaty, plotting to achieve something together in North China. The traitor Yin also decided to create an active group to serve as a pretext for seizing the political power of Hebei and Chahar. Furthermore, the puppet "Chinese National Anti-Communist Committee" was established on Suma Street in the Japanese Concession of Tianjin. At the same time, in Tianjin, traitors also formed an organization called the "Chinese National Good Neighborliness Association," located on Ishiyama Street in the Japanese Concession. Internally, the association is divided into military, political, diplomatic, document, transportation, general affairs, and personnel groups, with Jin Bihui, Bai Jianwu, and Li Shuchen serving as group leaders, respectively. The supervisors and monitors are foreign nationals. Li Shuchen was formerly a division commander under Wu Peifu. On the 4th of this month, he arrived in Beijing from Tianjin and made contact with the secretary of the military attaché's office of a certain embassy to absorb unemployed youth and ignorant people, with unfathomable intentions. He is still staying in the East Legation Quarter. At the end of last month, the traitor Yin also sent a former Zhili-Shandong Army division commander, a certain Li, to Tianjin to contact the so-called "Chinese National Good Neighborliness Association" and secretly discussed with Bai Jianwu the number of people to participate in the reorganization of the "East Hebei" puppet organization's security team. The director of the investigation office of the Tianjin Japanese Army Command, He Hushan, will go to Tongxian around the 15th to investigate the strength of the "East Hebei" militia. Furthermore, Fang Yongchang, the former commander of the 4th Army of the Zhili-Shandong Allied Army, sent Zhu Desen and Jin Bihui to organize the puppet "Chinese National League" at Kawashima Yoshiko's residence in Tianjin, sending minions to Henan and Hebei to contact bandits, intending to instigate riots to disrupt public order. However, Chi Zongmo, the puppet secretary-general of "East Hebei," dispatched confidants to secretly unite with the puppet security team and armed militia to secretly plot a second anti-Yin movement. This is a general overview of the actions of the traitors.</p>
<p>In the areas of eastern Suiyuan and northern Chahar, although the puppet army has not taken any significant action recently, in reality, a certain party is still constantly and actively manipulating them, such as increasing the number of puppet troops, transporting military supplies, and already preparing to instigate the puppet bandits to commit crimes again. Bao Yueqing has sent a Korean named Yu to Beijing to work as a spy, making his intention to rise again very clear. The authorities believe that at a time when China and Japan are conducting adjustments to diplomatic relations and economic cooperation, the political status quo of "East Hebei and Northern Chahar" is a major obstacle. If this situation is not eliminated, the so-called assistance will be difficult to achieve in reality. It is said that the Japanese military has been repeatedly informed and asked to urge Yin Rugeng to step down, and that Shi Yousan should form a war zone or the East Hebei Administrative Office. However, there is still no concrete progress. As a result, the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee decided to organize a delegation to Japan for observation around the 20th of this month. The delegation will be led by Tianjin Mayor Zhang Zizhong, with more than ten members, including brigade commanders from the 29th Army and advisors from the Beijing and Tianjin municipal governments. In addition to Yao Zuobin, Men Zhizhong, Liu Zhizhou, and Bian Shoujing, the remaining members will be selected by Zhang after requesting instructions from the highest authorities. Chen Zhongfu is also planning to travel to Japan on the 14th to make advance arrangements for everything, and he plans to stay in Japan for one or two months to make contacts so that future Sino-Japanese issues can proceed smoothly. As for Suiyuan Chairman Fu Zuoyi's trip to Beijing this time, in addition to handling his personal affairs, he also discussed defense matters with the local authorities because Chahar and Suiyuan are adjacent to each other, in order to establish close ties.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Guangdong Provincial Government Chairman Wu Tiecheng Arrives in Guangdong to Assume Office</h3>
<p>Wu Declares His Intention to Seek Welfare for His Hometown, Focusing on Production and Construction and Rectifying Officialdom</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The newly appointed Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, Wu Tiecheng, arrived in Guangdong on the 14th of this month. On that day, more than a thousand officials from various agencies and representatives from various organizations were at the Dashatou Railway Station on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. The enthusiastic atmosphere was unprecedented. Since the death of former Chairman Huang Musong, the provincial government's political affairs have been stagnant for a long time. The public is eager to solve the current urgent problems, such as the visa-free import of foreign rice, the improvement of the method of transporting and selling salt to Hunan, the quick determination of the tax standards for business tax, the adjustment of the anti-smoking work, and the handling of the local tobacco unified tax. All of these issues need to be discussed and properly handled by the highest authorities of the province, and the above issues are closely related to merchants. As for the administrative aspects, the main problem is the financial problem. In recent years, the finances of Guangdong Province have been unable to make up for the loss of large donations and payments, and although there are ambitious plans for important facilities for transportation and road construction, they are difficult to implement due to lack of funding. Therefore, the future distribution of finances urgently needs to be planned by the head of the government. For this reason, the arrival of the new chairman this time is attracting attention from the people of Guangdong and his colleagues. On the day of his arrival in Guangdong, Wu immediately met with the heads of various departments of the provincial government at the Tuisi Garden, listened to the recent political situation in Guangdong, and then immediately visited the military commander Yu Hanmou to discuss everything. Wu, who had just arrived in Guangzhou, had not yet fully understood the situation in Guangdong, so his remarks to reporters were just a routine platitude, roughly meaning that he would uphold the central government's intentions and build a new Guangdong. As for measures for reform, he would first understand the people's hidden feelings, adopt public opinion, and strive to increase public welfare and relieve people's difficulties as his guiding principles. At 3 p.m. that afternoon, he attended the general assembly of all sectors of society welcoming Wu's return to Guangdong to govern. No less than two to three thousand representatives from various agencies, organizations, and schools attended. Deng Yanhua, a special commissioner from the provincial party headquarters, presided over the meeting, delivered a welcome speech, introduced Wu's past achievements, and stated the expectations of all sectors of society. Wu's response can be summarized in several points. On the active side, the entire policy lies in building a new Guangdong. Secondly, we will strive to engage in production and construction, support the development of the rural economy and industry, and strive to increase the welfare of all people. Furthermore, we will improve the cultural level and catch up with the world's civilization. As for the negative aspects, we will strive to build a clean government, starting with the rectification of officialdom, so that good politics can be smoothly implemented. As for how to make the prohibition of smoking and gambling completely eliminate malpractices, and how to abolish exorbitant taxes, we will strive to the best of our ability and be a loyal servant of our hometown, hoping to add to our duties, etc. After the meeting, Yu Hanmou hosted a banquet at his private residence to welcome Wu and discuss political affairs until 9 p.m. Wu met with representatives from various parties the next day (the 15th) and was very busy. He did not take over the provincial government until the 16th. The inauguration ceremony will be held later. (April 15)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Electrical Users Call for Association</h3>
<p>Since our city's electric company purchased and used the power supply last winter, although the lights are brighter, there are still power outages in the evening, and the electricity bill of 24 cents per kilowatt-hour is too expensive. After the city's users organized an association, they repeatedly negotiated with the company to reduce fees and improve services, and unanimously decided to stop paying electricity bills until the company made improvements. After repeated mediation by party and government agencies, the company has not shown any sincerity and has been cutting off lines to users in recent days.

At about 5 pm on the 7th, after school was dismissed, she returned to her dormitory outside the school. On the way, she suddenly encountered Feng Zhenhua, the instructor of the People's School, who stopped her to tease her and acted inappropriately. Then, in front of the People's School, he forcibly dragged Ms. Ma into the school. Fortunately, she struggled and escaped. At 0:30 on the 10th, Feng broke into Ms. Ma's office again, using vulgar language and using violence to threaten her. After Ma warned him, Feng not only did not repent, but also punched her, injuring her ribs. Then he took out a gun and tried to kill her. In shock, Ma fled back to the city and, together with her husband Xu Baitang, reported the situation to the education bureau. On the 13th, she met with County Chief Zhang and handed in a petition, requesting that public prosecution be initiated to uphold morals.</p>

Police Chief Hu Fangzhen immediately sent police to investigate, but found no trace. Then, a person named Du Keran reported by telephone that he was robbed of three yuan of national currency and a felt hat by five bandits near Lizhuang on Xicheng Road. It was determined that this corresponded to the gunshots just heard, so seven police officers were sent to search in armed groups. Near Yansheng Temple, they encountered a man in a gray uniform. Just as they were about to question him, the man suddenly opened fire with a wooden-cased gun. Fortunately, it missed. It was late at night, and the man slipped and fell into a wheat field. The police rushed forward and held him down. The bandit opened fire to resist and struggled for a long time. They chased him to the vicinity of Waiyangqi before finally capturing him.

<p>Cheng Shizhang, the director of the Education Department, has been unpopular since he took office in 1933 due to the placement of private individuals such as Cheng Zongxuan, Cheng Maoyun, and Cheng Bocheng, as well as the burning of the Special Education Office. In addition, a part of the education sector opposed Cheng's perfunctory attitude, and there was an early brewing of a movement to overthrow Cheng. Therefore, declarations of expelling Cheng and eliminating traitors were found everywhere in recent days. The Jian Bao and Shang Bao of this city disclosed the full text on the 10th. Cheng was furious when he saw the report and asked Huang Guangdou, the director of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, to detain Zhong Fuhou, the Deputy President of the Jian Bao, and Xiong Wenzhao, the President of the Shang Bao, separately to the Public Security Bureau on the evening of the 10th. Huang was unwilling to take responsibility for others because the matter was related to the judiciary, and sent them to the local court on the same day. After the court granted bail and released them, the city's press believed that Cheng had abused his power and illegally arrested reporters, and held an emergency meeting at Sizhaolou on the evening of the 11th. The presidents of the Minguo, Huazhong, Gongshang, Xinwen, Jian Bao, Min Bao, Zheng Bao, and Shang Bao newspaper offices, as well as reporters from the Rural, Central, Local, and Jiangxi Jian news agencies, Sun Jiajie and others, attended. Li Xihong presided over the meeting, and the following resolutions were passed: ⑴ Jointly issue a declaration and unanimously condemn Cheng Shizhang for instigating Huang Guangdou to illegally arrest members of the press, ⑵ Report to the Central Propaganda Department and severely punish him, ⑶ Send a telegram to the national press for unanimous assistance.</p>

<h3>Taxpayers Association Replies to Lawyers Association Sympathizing with the Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction Advocacy</h3>
<p>Extracting Important Past Documents for Reference</p>
<p>The abolition of consular jurisdiction of various countries in China has become a unanimous goal of the whole country. Various public organizations in this city are also preparing to form a "Consular Jurisdiction Abolition Association" to conduct research and serve as a support for the government. The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession yesterday replied to the Lawyers Association with a summary of important documents related to the abolition of consular jurisdiction in the past, which is of considerable reference value. The original letter reads: "Respectfully, your letter of April 6th regarding the abolition of foreign consular jurisdiction in China has been received. In regards to this matter, this association telegraphed Minister Wang Rutang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 14th, July 10th, and November 28th of the Republic of China. The telegram of May 14th stated, 'Foreigners who enjoy consular jurisdiction in China by virtue of unequal treaties often say that China's legal protection is unsound and lacks the ability to safeguard the lives and property of foreigners, and believe that the time is not yet ripe for China to abolish consular jurisdiction. In fact, without the abolition of consular jurisdiction, China's legal protection will never be sound and will never have the ability to safeguard the lives and property of foreigners. Moreover, it is actually a germ of China's chaos. Take Shanghai as an example, roulette gambling dens operate under Mexican nationality, dog racing gambling proceeds under British and French nationality, and opium and military goods are filled with British, Japanese and other nationalities. A foreign flag is better than a diplomatic mission, and the crimes under its protection cannot be investigated by Chinese courts. Extending this to the implementation of the law in the interior, there is always a foreign flag and foreign nationality to sabotage it. Your Excellency knows that the germ of China's chaos is consular jurisdiction. After recovering tax rights, immediately engage in the abolition of consular jurisdiction in order to</p>
<p>complete legal rights,</p>
<p>improve legal protection, and enhance the ability to safeguard the lives and property of Chinese and foreign people. Those who maintain world peace will be happy to promise. Unexpectedly, various chambers of commerce in Shanghai that enjoy consular jurisdiction are stubbornly opposed, like madmen. The association cannot help but regret this, so it specifically telegraphs Your Excellency, this association has the spirit of not giving up. After successive diplomatic victories and under the commendation of the National Government, it will continue to eliminate the consular jurisdiction that causes chaos in China.' The telegram of July 10th stated, 'Among the unequal treaties, the one that most exhausts our country's economy is the lack of autonomy in national taxation, and the one that most disrupts our country's order is the consular jurisdiction that undermines our country's legal rights. Your Excellency has clear insight and insight into the key points. In the past, negotiations were carried out to realize tariff autonomy, and finally, the goal was achieved this year. The national economy has shown signs of recovery, and there is a trend of long-term progress in industry and commerce. The people are celebrating. Now, Your Excellency is also negotiating the abolition of consular jurisdiction in order to indirectly eliminate the seeds of chaos that disrupt our country's order under its protection, and establish a stable social foundation for all ages. How happy we are! However, most foreign businessmen do not understand the principles and like to make unfair opposition. They do not know that it will only cause resentment from our people and increase great obstacles to business. The association cannot help but regret this. In order to assist Your Excellency, the association, at the banquet for the American Carnegie reporters, Chairman Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, explaining the evils of consular jurisdiction, which is enough to hinder the progress of Sino-foreign business, forcefully and with evidence, and also sent letters to various groups to unanimously advocate, in order to create the people's determination to abolish consular jurisdiction without looking back, and to fulfill the people's duty to seek freedom and equality for China. We believe that unifying legal rights and protecting the internal affairs of independent countries should not be</p>
<p>like building a house on the roadside with foreigners, or seeking fur from a tiger. Because our country has always valued integrity and loved peace, it may be appropriate to inform them. If the countries concerned turn against the guests and rely on strength to resist stubbornly, please ask Your Excellency to take</p>
<p>decisive action</p>
<p>and decide to announce that from January 1st of next year, all foreign people and groups in China will be dealt with according to Chinese law in civil and criminal cases without exception. Otherwise, they will not be granted legal bail.' The telegram of November 28th stated, 'The Ma Daily replied, learning that the abolition of foreign consular jurisdiction in China is being actively carried out, showing that Your Excellency handles diplomacy, adheres to the Prime Minister's instructions, adheres to the principle of non-concession, and fulfills the expectations of the people. How happy we are! However, it is necessary to be a thief for things, and long nights are prone to dreams. Foreign countries that take aggression as their policy, hold their arrogance, and consult with them on the abolition of consular jurisdiction are like seeking fur from a tiger, and it is easy to cause other problems. Looking at the wording of the reply, it is said that our country's laws must meet the standards of each country before consular jurisdiction in China can be abandoned. This is an unreasonable theory. The purpose is only to maintain the tool of aggression against our country in order to achieve its illicit gains. The quality of the law is relative rather than absolute. The cause of the law is the history of the nation. Since the histories of the nations are different, the standards of their laws are also different. Otherwise, why is the European continent divided into continental and marine schools of law? This is common sense for political scholars, but the authorities of the countries with consular jurisdiction in China seem not to know this. It can be concluded that they have ulterior motives. Moreover, independent countries have supreme and inviolable legal rights. If it is said that the standard of our country's laws does not meet their country's standards, their people can leave our country and not come, just as our people are unwilling to abide by their country's laws and abandon them. Furthermore, the customs of our people are the same as those of any other country. If foreign countries can use the excuse that our country's laws do not meet the standards of each country and want to maintain consular jurisdiction in China, then why can't our country use the excuse that the laws of each country do not meet our standards and make the consuls stationed in each country exercise the right to judge overseas Chinese? This can be concluded that they are not sincerely willing to abandon consular jurisdiction in China. Then how can it be done? Only by exercising our country's supreme legal rights, the government immediately issued a clear order that all foreign people in China, from January 1, 1919 of the Republic of China, their civil and criminal cases shall be handled by Chinese law,</p>
<p>without exception.</p>
<p>In addition, the recognition of foreign consular jurisdiction in China in the past shall be revoked uniformly on the same day. In addition to this clear order, a method shall be formulated that all foreign people coming to China, who are unwilling to abandon consular jurisdiction, shall be required by the customs to submit a letter of guarantee to abide by Chinese laws before being allowed to land. In civil and criminal cases, if the plaintiff is a foreigner and the defendant is Chinese, the Chinese court shall accept it only after obtaining a guarantee from the plaintiff to abide by Chinese laws. If the plaintiff is Chinese and the defendant is a foreigner, it shall be handled through diplomatic channels. The first method, although the matters are uniform, the example of its effectiveness can be cited. That is, the Shanghai Public Concession Engineering Bureau requires Chinese residents outside the boundary who want to use public concession water and electricity to first submit a voluntary letter of willingness to pay municipal donations before connecting. Regarding the abolition of consular jurisdiction, Your Excellency's long-term plans must have been carefully planned. The association should not interfere with the hearing, but because of its eagerness to protect legal rights, it dare not remain silent, and expresses its views as one of a thousand considerations, and telegraphs Your Excellency to adopt and implement them. The integrity of legal rights will be recorded in history, and we will pray sincerely.' Also, the letter to various groups on July 10th of the same year said, 'The decline of our country's national power, the poverty of the people and the exhaustion of wealth, are due to the shackles of unequal treaties. Among the unequal treaties, the one that most exhausts our country's economy is the lack of tariff autonomy, and the one that most disrupts our country's order is the consular jurisdiction that undermines the unification of legal rights. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs followed the party-state policy and saw through the key points, so he carried out the realization of tax autonomy last year and achieved the goal. This year, he started the abolition of consular jurisdiction, based on his spirit of non-concession and the experience of successive victories, and decided to implement the unification of legal rights from January 1st of next year. Then all our people should be the driving force for seeking freedom and equality and support the government. It can be said that all the seeds of chaos in China's order occur under the protection of consular jurisdiction. Therefore, in order to unify legal rights and stabilize order, we hereby request your association to unanimously advocate and awaken people's hearts to move towards the same goal. The party-state is fortunate, etc. After Dr. Wang resigned, several years have passed and it has not been realized, which is very painful. Now, reading the proposal and submission of Mr. Lu Dingkui, a member of your association, makes this association even more admirable. The reason for the approval is that in addition to requesting the government to jointly advocate, we are responding accordingly. Please check it for your information. Sincerely, Shanghai Lawyers Association."</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce and Fourteen Other Public Organizations Hosted a Banquet for Lofink Last Night</h3>
<p>Chairman Qu Linkang Gave a Welcome Speech, Mr. Lofink Admired the Rapid Progress of Our Country's Construction</p>
<p>Mr. Lofink, Director of East Asian Affairs of the Dutch East Indies Government, came to China for inspection. After arriving in Shanghai a few days ago, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the International Trade Bureau, and fourteen other public organizations in this city hosted a banquet for Mr. Lofink at the International Hotel last night at 8 o'clock. The guests and hosts who attended the banquet included Mr. Lofink, Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai Paul Scheltema, Consul Leeuwenburg, Jardine Matheson boss Remer, and Lin Kanghou, Wu Yunzhai, Guo Shun, Gu Huaibing, Zeng Keyuan, Wang Kuisheng, Pan Yangyao, Hu Xiyuan, Xu Xiaochu, Zhao Tiezhang, and others, more than fifty people. Chinese food was served. Lin Kanghou gave a welcome speech on behalf of the public organizations, followed by a thank you speech from Mr. Lofink, which was translated by Zeng Keyuan. The toasts were exchanged until about 10 o'clock, when the banquet ended happily.</p>
<p>Welcome Speech</p>
<p>During the banquet, Lin Kanghou stood up and gave a welcome speech, saying, "Today, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and fourteen other organizations welcome Mr. Lofink, Director of East Asian Affairs of the Dutch East Indies Government, and have prepared a simple feast to welcome Mr. Lofink. It is a great honor for Mr. Lofink to grace us with his presence. Looking back on the relations between China and the Netherlands, they have always been cordial. Although they are separated by Europe and Asia, they have had envoys very early. In particular, the Dutch East Indies, which is adjacent to China, has very close relations. According to research, the East Indies began to belong to the Netherlands after the 16th century, while in China, during the Jin Dynasty, about 1,030 years ago, there was a monk named Faxian who returned to China from India and passed through Java. At that time, there were already Chinese living there. Later, they continued to develop to various islands, and the number of Chinese going south also increased from generation to generation. Until recently, the total number of Chinese living in various islands of the East Indies is about one million. Initially, there were only eleven people in the East Indies islands, and culture and commerce were not yet developed. The Chinese pioneers devoted themselves to management. Later, they were managed by the Netherlands, and they cooperated together to create the East Indies of today. To this day, the Chinese occupy an absolute economic position in the East Indies. Therefore, looking back on the past and speculating on the future, the prosperity and decline of the East Indies are closely related to the Chinese. The year before last, Mr. Hart, the Minister of Economic Affairs of the Dutch East Indies, visited Shanghai, and I had the opportunity to meet with him to talk about the close and friendly relations between China and the Netherlands. Now, Mr. Lofink is the Director of East Asian Affairs of the Dutch East Indies, and he must have a clearer understanding of the relationship between China and the Netherlands, and will remove any obstacles to our friendship. China has now completed its unification and will make even greater efforts to promote mutual friendship. I would like to represent the fourteen organizations to offer a toast to Mr. Lofink and ask Mr. Lofink to give us your advice."</p>
<p>Mr. Lofink's Reply</p>
<p>Then Mr. Lofink gave a speech in reply, saying, "I am visiting China, and I am deeply grateful for the warm hospitality of the leaders of industry and commerce in Shanghai. I just heard Mr. Lin say that the relations between China and the Netherlands have always been cordial, and especially the East Indies, which is adjacent to your country, has a closer relationship. I also deeply believe this. This time, I came north to visit your country's rapid progress in construction in recent years, and to contact people from your country, so as to continue to promote the relationship between the two countries, which is also my hope. Now, I would like to take the host's wine and wish all of you good health, and express my gratitude." It is also understood that Mr. Lofink will stay in Shanghai for several days, and then go to various parts of our country for inspection, with a period of about one month in China.</p>

<h3>Record of the Annual Meeting of the British Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Marshall and Peel Gave Speeches, Critiquing the Chinese Government's Goodwill</p>
<p>The China Press reports that the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce held its 22nd annual meeting on Thursday (15th) at the South Building Office, 27 The Bund. Chairman Marshall stated that China's trade and commerce in 1936 were better than in previous years. After years of recession, there has been a turnaround, and there is hope for more in the coming years. Although the improvement in trade last year was due to the small boom in Europe and the United States and the very good harvest in Chinese farmland, the Chinese government's increased trust at home and abroad, its increased attention to rural issues, the stability of its currency system, the maintenance of order, and the convenience of railway and highway transportation are also factors. All of these have permanent value for a country's trade and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Mr. Marshall continued to describe the situation in China in the past year, stating that the Liangguang Incident and the Xi'an Incident were resolved safely thanks to the calm handling of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the officials, and that Liangguang, which had been divided for many years, was again subject to central control. This greatly indicates the trustworthiness of the Chinese government and its policies. The satisfactory situation in the southwest has not been seen for a long time, but the situation in the north is still chaotic. Although the status quo is maintained with the Japanese side, it is easy to cause disturbances, otherwise it could have been cleared up long ago. Communism in the northwest is unlikely to be pacified until the economic life of the local people improves.</p>
<p>The export trade in 1936 did not see a turnaround until the second half of the year. However, foreign trade has not yet reached the number of 1,957,000,000 yuan in 1933. The total amount of shortages last year was 1,647,000,000 yuan. In December of this year, a sudden surplus was seen, which is very welcome. Last year, the United Kingdom still maintained its fourth place in China's import and export trade. However, if the figures for the Empire are included, the order will change as follows (in units of 1 million yuan): British Empire 429 yuan (175 yuan), the United States and its territories 383 yuan (371 yuan), Japan 305 yuan (255 yuan), Germany 189 yuan. The numbers in parentheses are the countries concerned, excluding their overseas trade reports.</p>
<p>Mr. Marshall next mentioned the heavy losses suffered by Chinese customs due to Japanese smuggling in China, saying that the losses last year reached 50 million yuan. This organized and large-scale action must have been tacitly supported by Japanese officials in North China. The Chinese anti-smuggling office once complied with the request of the Japanese military personnel, and the anti-smuggling personnel were not allowed to carry test equipment within the three-mile limit, so they could not deal with armed smugglers and could not prevent smuggled goods from being unloaded in the unarmed area. Although the Chinese authorities tried to prevent smuggled goods from being transported by rail, armed Japanese still used trucks to transport them, so it was impossible to prevent them. Although protests were made to the Japanese government from all sides, they were all ineffective. If the Japanese government is willing, this so-called "special trade" can be easily curbed. It is incomprehensible that a first-class power should turn a blind eye to acts that clearly infringe upon the rights of friendly countries.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom's import and export trade in China is surpassed by the United States, Japan, and Germany and ranks fourth. To remedy this, it cannot rely solely on British merchants in China, but also on domestic manufacturers, as the price and preferential credit conditions are often important factors in obtaining orders. Therefore, the British government sent Mr. Kirkpatrick, the government's credit guarantee bureau representative, to China. This move will be very beneficial to increasing trade with China.</p>
<p>In recent years, China has been manufacturing its own best-selling imported goods, and the number of foreign imports has decreased year by year. However, the sales of several items that China cannot manufacture profitably have increased compared with before, which seems to offset the reduced number. The development of industry and the construction of private manufacturing plants are very beneficial to the country, and the government should encourage them. However, the Chinese government, especially the provincial governments, is now also engaged in building factories. This move is enough to make private entrepreneurs feel cold and have an adverse impact on the development of industry. The US government's factories do not necessarily seek to make profits, and private factories have insufficient financial resources to compete with them, making it difficult to compete with them. Some developments, such as public utilities, electricity, water, railways, etc., are built with public funds, which is certainly correct, but most countries believe that it is unwise and uneconomical for the government to do more than encourage private entrepreneurs to develop industry, so they do not operate their own. The Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the National Economic Commission have many tasks to do, and it is said that they are subsidizing organizations that sell certain Chinese products abroad, which seems unfortunate. Although the authorities deny that they intend to establish a monopoly and deny that the subsidized agency is trying to compete with companies that have been established for many years, they have clearly joined the commercial market, not as consultants, but as competitors. The facts cannot be concealed. Many countries feel that commerce should be allowed to develop most easily if it follows the usual and long-established path. If the government intervenes or operates its own, it will not only fail to expand it, but also shrink it. For products such as tung oil and tea, efforts can be made to improve the quality and increase the quantity in the producing areas, facilitate their transportation, reduce their costs, and enable farmers to obtain the highest prices. This kind of move will benefit commerce and be able to compete with similar products and increase the sales of Chinese products. If the authorities take this path, it will be beneficial to the country and cannot be compared with the benefits obtained by joining the commercial market. "China's reform of the currency system has exempted the exchange rate from major fluctuations, and the import and export trade has benefited greatly as a result. It is hoped that the move to change the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank will be realized as soon as possible, so that the legal currency will be more consolidated.</p>
<p>Next, the yarn and woolen industry were mentioned. At the beginning of the year, the yarn factories went through a difficult period, and many factories were closed or temporarily closed. However, there was a turnaround near the end of the year, and they are now gradually improving. The woolen industry is very developed, and several new factories have been added last year, and there are still plans to open more. This industry still has room for development. Chinese factories have mostly been set up in several large industrial centers, and now there is a trend of expanding and setting up small-scale factories in the raw material production areas. The products produced can be sold locally, and there is less risk of labor disputes. At present, there is an increasing number of technical personnel graduating from vocational schools and universities, so the future development of all industries that require mechanical knowledge must be accelerated, as these people must seek employment in government undertakings, public companies, and factories.</p>
<p>Mr. Marshall next stated that the Chinese government cleared up several overdue debts last year, which restored China's credit. Chinese securities rose in price in London. This was due to the efforts of Sir Leith-Ross, Zhang Jia'ao, and others. Zhang not only cleared railway bonds, but also expanded existing railways and planned to build new railways. As for highways, they are also being actively built. There are now 112,000 kilometers of highways in the country, while in 1921 there were only 1,000 kilometers. This greatly facilitates transportation and greatly promotes the possibility of national commerce. Other aspects, such as aviation and long-distance telephones, have also made great progress. The above are the major aspects of China's recent material progress and development. However, material progress is not enough without cultural progress to support it. In recent years, the number of large, medium, and small schools in China has increased greatly, and the number of students is much larger than in the past. All of these factors will have a major impact on China's future trade and commerce. We must prepare to cope with future changes so that we can adapt to the times.</p>
<p>In the past year, the central government promulgated many new laws, all aimed at controlling and regulating commerce and increasing tax revenue, such as the Insurance Law, the Insurance Business Law, the Registered Drug Ordinance, and the Pledge Law. There are many shortcomings in the Insurance Law, and although it has been promulgated, it has not yet been implemented. It is said that it is currently being considered for revision. Although it is necessary to crack down on the import and sale of drugs in the Registered Drug Ordinance, legitimate merchants will suffer greatly. There are certainly many shortcomings in it, but British merchants will comply with the registration and do their best to implement it. The Pledge Law has been carefully considered by the British Chamber of Commerce subcommittee, and there are many aspects that favor debtors, so we will ask the authorities to pay attention to it and revise it impartially for the benefit of Chinese and foreigners, so that creditors can obtain reasonable protection. After the revision of the Stamp Tax Law, the progress is very satisfactory. The Income Tax Law has aroused many objections. If a low rate of income tax is levied uniformly throughout the country, no one will object to the principle. However, there is currently no appropriate collection agency, and the income is not taxed uniformly, but only salaries are taxed, which is unfair. The countries concerned are currently considering the issue of applying this tax to foreigners in China. However, unless the regulations of the law are revised and implemented uniformly, although the countries cannot object in principle, they may not be willing to apply it to their citizens. Mr. Ma then described the various matters handled by the Chamber of Commerce last year and thanked the Chamber of Commerce subcommittee for its work throughout the year.</p>
<p>After Mr. Marshall finished his speech, Mr. Peel, the British Commercial Counselor in China, stood up and gave a speech. First, he stated that the progress of various undertakings in China in recent years proves that China has great hope for the future. This can be better understood by reading the report published by the Chairman of the Bank of China a few days ago. Next, he stated that the interests of the United Kingdom in China are not only in direct trade with China. The British have invested huge sums in China's shipping, banking, real estate, industry, railways, and insurance. The total amount of British investment in China cannot be matched by any foreign country. This point cannot be ignored, as it proves our trust in China, that is, our money. Today, the call for "cooperation with China" is rampant. Our British cooperation with China did not start today, but has been around for a long time, so there is no need to re-establish new policies. Moreover, our investment in China is not only for our own profit, but also for the profit of China. If the profits obtained by both parties are compared, China's profit is greater than ours. Our investment in revitalizing various undertakings in China is the right path. This path, whether it is a high mountain or a deep valley, is in front of us and must continue to be followed, as this is the right path that benefits China and benefits us. Mr. Peel concluded by saying that the future atmosphere of China and the United Kingdom is now better than before. Now that we have steady progress in our country, we can further expand the commercial relationship between China and the United Kingdom. We can buy more Chinese products in the future and sell more British goods to China. After the difficulties of the past few years, we will be able to reap rich rewards in the future.</p>
<p>After the meeting of the British Chamber of Commerce was held, the annual meeting of the China Association was held, and Chairman Massey reported on the association's affairs before selecting a new committee and adjourning the meeting.</p>
<h3>Prominent Officials and Businessmen Return to Shanghai from Ningbo</h3>
<p>Mr. Jiang Xihou, the elder brother of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, was laid to rest on the 15th at the foot of Taokeng Mountain after a memorial service held on the 14th in Xikou. Many prominent figures attended to pay their respects. Besides Feng Yuxiang, Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, Yu Feipeng, and Huang Shaohong, who are staying in Ningbo, Zhang Gongquan, Ma Chaojun, and Chen Jianru have gone to Hangzhou. Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin, upon the invitation of Wang Xiaolai, went on a trip to Shaoxing. Xu Shiying and Jiang Bocheng returned to Shanghai the night before last from Hangzhou. He Yingqin, Jiang Zuobin, Xu Yongchang, Wei Daoming, Wu Zhongxin, Zhu Ziqiao, Liu Ruiheng, He Yaoyaozu, Zhang Zhizhong, Chen Jie, Liu Jiwen, Wang Shuchang, Xiong Bin, Gu Zhenglun, Tang Liu, and Li Hongwen all arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 5 a.m. aboard the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Xin Jiangtian"轮. Sun Ke's representatives, Wu Jingxiong and Yu Zuoting, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 5 a.m. aboard the Ningshao Company's "Xin Ningshao"轮. Song Ziwen and Song Ziliang also returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon via Hangzhou. Minister of Interior Jiang returned to Nanjing in the early train at 8 a.m. Wei Daoming, Zhu Ziqiao, and Zhang Zhizhong returned to Nanjing on the night train at 11 p.m. The remaining individuals will return to Nanjing one after another in the next few days to attend to their duties.</p>
<p>Chiang on Chairman's Recovery</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Jiang Zuobin stated that Chairman Chiang's health has greatly improved compared to before. He is in good spirits and his complexion is good, but his back injury has not fully recovered, so he still needs to rest. This time, he presided over his elder brother's funeral in Xikou, and was more grief-stricken than usual. Therefore, he did not meet with many of the guests. For those who did meet, he only expressed his condolences and did not discuss official business at all. Previously, he patrolled the whole country to inspect the administration of various provinces and cities, but unexpectedly when he arrived in Xi'an, the Xi'an Incident occurred, and the original plan was disrupted. He has now decided to continue his patrol, but the date of departure is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>He on the Pacification of Sichuan Rumors</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, He Yingqin stated that the rumors in Sichuan have subsided since Deng Hanxiang and Lu Zuofu came to Nanjing. The six measures proposed by him, as reported in the newspapers, are all related to the nationalization of the Sichuan Army. After the Sichuan Army is completely nationalized, all rumors can be dispelled by facts. Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi have decided to come to Nanjing, but the exact date of departure is yet to be determined. Whether he will go to Sichuan is also yet to be decided.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Grain Merchants from Six Provinces and Cities Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Determined to Petition in Nanjing for the Third Time</p>
<p>Representatives of the grain industry from six provinces and cities, including Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Shanghai, held a joint meeting at the Shanghai Grain Trade Association yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. A total of 23 attendees included Bao Jun'an, Huang Yunqing, Xie Beimao (from Hubei), Shen Renwu, Huang Shisan (from Jiangxi), Chen Yunseng (from Hunan), and Gu Xinyi, Chen Ziyi (from Shanghai). Gu Xinyi, as chairman, reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying, "The case of exempting imported foreign rice from grain tax in Guangdong has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for deliberation by the Ministries of Finance and Industry, following the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 6th. According to reports, the Ministry of Finance has invited the directors of various departments and the two directors of the Ministry of Industry's Agriculture and Commerce departments to discuss and reach a conclusion. However, it is heard that Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry believes that it should be reconsidered, and the results of the study will be reported to the Executive Yuan for review and decision. I believe everyone has seen this, but the details of the discussion are unknown. We should discuss how to proceed and whether we should petition for the third time to make a decision." He also said that the matter has aroused close attention from all walks of life. Relevant organizations from various provinces have been striving hard, sending numerous letters and telegrams. The media has also published many articles criticizing it. Therefore, he has collected and compiled them into a volume and distributed it to those concerned about the foreign rice tax exemption issue to show a glimpse of public sentiment. He will distribute the compiled volume on the Guangdong foreign rice tax exemption issue for everyone to browse. Afterwards, representatives from various provinces spoke in succession and then began the discussion. As a result, they decided to urge the Executive Yuan and Ministries to take immediate measures to remedy the situation and to soothe public expectations.

According to people in the Sichuan shipping industry, Shanghai will not procure goods for Sichuan before the Dragon Boat Festival this year, and it will have to wait until July for the water to rise and restore navigation before considering loading goods into Sichuan, but it has been blocked for half a year. It is now spring, but it is as dry as a drought, which is unprecedented in nearly 70 years.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Governments Prosecute Yongshun Company According to Law</h3>
<p>Regarding the Yongxin轮 disaster, after the Shanghai-Zhejiang Association twice invited the bereaved families and responsible persons of the Yongshun Company to discuss the aftermath, the association received a reply from the Yongshun Company on the 17th of last month stating that many changes had been made to the agreed-upon aftermath arrangements, making it impossible to proceed. Therefore, it petitioned the Jiangsu Provincial Government for a fair and strict handling, and reported it to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government, and published a notice in the newspaper and informed the bereaved families. It is now learned that the association has received a reply from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating that all documents have been received and ordered to be sent to the Wujiang County Government for strict handling in accordance with the law.

Special attention should be paid to external social engagements to avoid suspicion. Shanghai is a place where people from all walks of life gather, both good and bad, and there are many criminal acts as a result. Therefore, as a prosecutor, not only should you examine the facts of the allegations, but also make careful investigations based on the authority of the state on rumors related to criminal responsibility, so as not to be unworthy of your position. The representative of the Party Committee, guest Yang Peng, and President Lu of the court gave speeches. Finally, Chief Prosecutor Du gave a reply, and then a photo was taken and refreshments were served before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Office Renamed Income Tax Collection Bureau</h3>
<p>The Bureau Will Move to a New Address</p>
<p>In order to unify the organization, the Ministry of Finance has renamed the Income Tax Offices in various provinces and cities as Income Tax Collection Bureaus and has revised the organizational law, which was approved before Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi went abroad. On the 14th, the Ministry officially announced it. This reporter inquired at the Shanghai Office and learned that the Ministry's order should arrive today (the 17th). As for the reorganization, because the office has already been operating in accordance with the new organizational law, there will be no changes, only the name will be changed, and the original director of the office will be renamed director of the bureau. It is also learned that the bureau has leased the building of the Huayi Bank at 259 Jiujiang Road as its new location because the original building on Hankou Road is not sufficient, and the accounting department is located in the Continental Bank Building on Jiujiang Road, which is inconvenient for office work. The bureau is currently undergoing internal renovations and is scheduled to move in on the first of next month.</p>
<h3>Workers of the Public Welfare Yarn Factory Petitioned Yesterday Morning but Were Blocked</h3>
<p>Patrol Officer Zhao of the Caojiadu Branch Promised to Forward the Request to the Bureau of Social Affairs for Mediation</p>
<p>The workers of the Public Welfare Yarn Factory at 150 Robison Road submitted eight demands to the management earlier, but no results were achieved, so they implemented a slowdown, which led to a conflict and 19 injuries. The case has been going on for many days, and although the workers have petitioned the Party and government authorities several times, no results have been obtained. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., all 2,000 workers held a general meeting at the playground of the Ganggong Primary School on Bailinan Road. Chairman Dai Guoliang first reported that the factory had not been opened since the strike, and their livelihood was in a panic. Although they had repeatedly petitioned the Party and government for mediation, there had been no results. After discussion, it was decided to petition the Bureau of Social Affairs that day. If there were no satisfactory results, they vowed not to leave the Bureau of Social Affairs. Immediately at 11 a.m., they marched in line from the back road of Jessfield Road to the Sanguantang Bridge. At that time, the Caojiadu Police Station heard the news and immediately sent police to block the bridge. The two sides were deadlocked. Patrol Officer Zhao persuaded the workers, promising to forward the purpose of the petition to the Bureau of Social Affairs through the police station for immediate mediation. If there were no results, they could go to petition again after completing the procedures. The workers originally wanted to insist on going, but after Patrol Officer Zhao's bitter persuasion, coupled with the rain, they still folded back and dispersed at 11:30 a.m. The Caojiadu Police Station has forwarded the purpose of the workers' petition to the Bureau of Social Affairs for immediate mediation to avoid further disputes and maintain the livelihood of the workers.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Health Bureau Ordered to Handle Registration of National Physicians</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Health Bureau has been handling the registration of national physicians since 1927. Over the past 11 years, it has completed ten registrations, with more than 7,000 physicians registered. The original method was to hire specialized personnel to organize a trial committee to handle the review and inquiry matters. Those who passed the review were issued licenses, otherwise, they were issued licenses after passing the periodic examinations.</p>
<p>Careful Handling</p>
<p>Since the Central Health Administration issued the Chinese Medicine Regulations and the Chinese Medicine Examination Rules, and ordered local governments to handle the review and certification of Chinese medicine practitioners, the Shanghai Health Bureau immediately prepared carefully and organized an inquiry committee. Those who the bureau deemed questionable after review were sent to the committee for inquiry.</p>
<p>Required Qualifications</p>
<p>The qualifications stipulated in the new methods are as follows: (1) Those who have passed the Chinese medicine examination or screening by the central or provincial government and have certificates; (2) Those who have been issued medical licenses by the central or provincial government; (3) Those who have graduated from Chinese medicine schools registered with the Ministry of Education or local education authorities and have certificates; (4) Those who have practiced Chinese medicine for more than five years and have proof from the competent authority of the place of practice.</p>
<p>Registration Procedures</p>
<p>The registration procedures are to fill out three copies of the resume and four 2-inch half-length photos, a certificate fee of 5 yuan, and stamp tax fee of yuan, along with supporting documents. The resume can be requested from the bureau by letter or picked up in person.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Bureau's Freight and Passenger Revenue Increased in February</h3>
<p>The total freight and passenger revenue of the state-run China Merchants Bureau in February this year was 898,666.07 yuan, an increase of more than 240,000 yuan compared to the revenue of 658,367.17 yuan in February of the 25th year of the Republic, accounting for 36%. It is noted that the month of February is the traditional Chinese New Year, which is usually a slow month. When the bureau was not reorganized, the total freight and passenger revenue in February of the 24th year of the Republic was only about 420,000 yuan. After the reorganization in the 25th year of the Republic, the revenue in February increased by more than 200,000 yuan compared to February of the 24th year of the Republic. The revenue in February this year reached more than 890,000 yuan, which is more than double the increase before the reorganization, and there is a trend of increasing year by year.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telephone Bureau's Business Develops Rapidly</h3>
<p>Machine Lines Gradually Become Insufficient</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has made active progress in the past five years in the reorganization of telephone poles and lines in the city, the activation of automatic mechanical parts, the recovery of telephone rights in Pudong, the expansion of township telephones, and the opening of long-distance international telephones. At the same time, the number of users has increased from more than 1,000 to about 5,000. Recently, with the increasing prosperity of the market, the number of new users has increased even more, so that the original equipment is gradually becoming insufficient to cope with, especially the full capacity of the automatic exchanges in the Nanshi and Longhua districts. In view of this, the bureau has already prepared detailed expansion plans for various districts and submitted them to the Ministry of Communications for review and decision. It is now heard that the Ministry of Communications has approved it, but it will take time to purchase new parts and expand the project. Therefore, before the expansion is completed, applications for telephones in the Nanshi and Longhua districts can only be handled slowly, but they can first register with the business division of the bureau, so that when the bureau expands the machine lines or when a user dismantles the machine, it can be installed in accordance with the order of registration.</p>
<h3>Lack of Ocean Liner Tonnage</h3>
<p>Freight Rates Naturally Increase</p>
<p>According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, since our country's paper currency policy was adopted, domestic finances have stabilized, coupled with bumper harvests of local products and a sharp increase in the purchasing power of rural areas, commodity prices have soared, and all industries have shown a booming atmosphere. The shipping industry is no exception. Recently, European and Far Eastern countries have been actively expanding their armaments and sparing no effort in procuring hardware, fuel, steel, etc. Furthermore, due to the increased cost of ships, in recent months, more than a dozen ocean liners have been leased from our country, totaling 80,000 tons. It is estimated that the total tonnage of the country is only more than 500,000 tons, and ocean liners are about 300,000 tons. Now, nearly one-third of them are subleased by Japan, Nanyang, and other places, so there is a sudden lack of ocean liner tonnage. Ship rents and freight rates have skyrocketed. For example, the freight rate for transporting coal from Qingdao to Shanghai was once 95 cents per ton three years ago, but now it has risen to 2.40 yuan per ton, and there is still no ship available. Another example is transporting salt from Chenjiagang to Twelve Forts, which was 2.40 yuan per ton at low times, but now it has been raised to 6.50 yuan per ton. Shipping salt from Haizhou to Yuezhou was still hovering around 4.50 yuan per ton last year, but this spring it suddenly rose to 12 yuan. As for ship rents, each deadweight ton was only 2.56 yuan last winter, but unexpectedly this year, during the Lunar New Year, Hong Kong chartered more than a dozen medium-sized ocean liners to load Saigon rice, etc., due to the half-tax and tax-free status of foreign rice, causing the rent to rise to 5.75 yuan per ton, breaking the ship price record of more than ten years. In short, because the monthly rent of non-scheduled liners has soared, shipowners are rushing to lease them out for the sake of profit, with a time of six months or one year. As a result, coastal preparations are lacking in ship transport. Therefore, scheduled liners are insufficient for transport, and freight rates will naturally continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Guild Requests to be in the City Center</h3>
<p>Fifty Rickshaws to be Opened</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Guild has requested the Municipal Government's Public Utility Bureau to allow 50 rickshaws to be opened in the city center (specifically for driving in the city center) and to grant a patent in order to facilitate traffic because the municipal government and institutions have moved to the city center, and the city is becoming more prosperous. During the patent period, public buses should not increase in number. It will begin as soon as it is approved.</p>
<h3>Automobile Disappears Within the French Concession</h3>
<p>No. 4504</p>
<p>At approximately 11:15 PM last night, a carjacking incident occurred within the French Concession. The vehicle in question was a Morris brand, bearing license plate number 4504. It had not been registered with the city. Upon discovering the vehicle's disappearance, the owner immediately contacted the French Concession Police Department to request an investigation. Simultaneously, the French Concession Police Department promptly relayed the information to all municipal police agencies, requesting assistance in locating the vehicle. However, as of the reporter's deadline at midnight, the vehicle had not been found, and no other incidents had been reported. Law enforcement personnel are diligently continuing their efforts to investigate and prevent any further incidents.</p>
<h3>Huang Family Garden Tomorrow Banquet to Appreciate Century-Old Peonies</h3>

As they are in full bloom recently, Huang has specially invited notable figures from the military, police, political, business, and academic sectors of the city to a banquet in the garden tomorrow (Sunday, the 18th of this month) to appreciate them. It is expected to be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Girl Crushed to Death by Truck</h3>
<p>Only Daughter of Two Families, Brain Matter Splattered; Saved a Neighbor's Child but Lost Her Own Life</p>
<p>At approximately 8:00 AM yesterday morning, a mud truck crushed a girl to death near the second public bus stop, about 50 steps south of Tianyao Bridge, Xujiahui, West Shanghai. The circumstances of the accident are recorded below. He Yechun, 48 years old, from Siyang, previously operated a cake shop at No. 2652 Tianyao Bridge, but it has closed. His family still lives in the house. Yechun and his brother only had one daughter, named Xingxiu, who is now 16 years old. She is quite beautiful and has a lively personality. She is the apple of their eye and attends Mingde School nearby. Before the accident, Xingxiu was strolling there when she suddenly saw a three-year-old boy trying to cross the road. At the same time, a truck suddenly drove from the south. Fearing that the child would be hit, the girl rushed forward to pull him back. As a result, she lost one shoe and turned back to pick it up. In an instant, the truck had arrived and could not brake in time, knocking Xingxiu down and rolling over her face, crushing her head and killing her instantly. Subsequently, police officer Liu Zhennan from post No. 3480 stopped the mud truck with city license No. 13271 and rental license No. 1059, along with the driver Liu Anquan (from Funing, 32 years old, living at No. 19 Xiexingli, Zhizaoju Road), and the deceased's father He Yechun, and brought them back to the Jinji Bridge Police Station. Police Chief He Song rushed to inspect the scene of the accident and the route of the vehicle. He also ordered the local constable Cao Zhongqing to report to the court for verification. The driver Liu Anquan was also sent to the court for interrogation in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Investigation Details of the Sino-Foreign Relief Association's Relief Efforts in Dengfeng</h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association at 97 Renji Road, in collaboration with the Chinese Relief Society, jointly conducted relief efforts in Dengfeng, Henan. We have now received a report from Mr. Feng Yangshan, the director in charge of the investigation and distribution of relief. The investigation into the relief distribution is detailed as follows: "Upon investigation, Dengfeng is located at the foot of Mount Song in western Henan. The entire region is characterized by continuous mountain ranges, with predominantly sandy and rocky soil. The riverbeds are dry throughout the year, making water storage impossible. There are very few wells and springs, and the soil is thin and barren. Even in years of good harvest, the people are still exposed to the threat of cold and hunger. Moreover, last year's severe drought wreaked havoc, resulting in a complete failure of the autumn harvest. Up to now, not a drop of rain has fallen, and there is no hope for the spring wheat crop. The severity of the disaster and the suffering of the victims are truly unprecedented. The total population of the county is over 240,000, and more than 100,000 of them cannot survive without relief. These people suffer from hunger, consuming stone powder, soil, wild grass, locust leaves, and other such things to eke out a living. As a result, some have become ill from abdominal swelling, and others have died from poisoning. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang personally inspected the county last autumn and recognized the extreme severity of the disaster. He specifically allocated 10,000 yuan for work relief, enabling a portion of the younger and stronger victims to engage in road construction, afforestation, well-digging, canal-opening, and other work, thereby providing relief. It is recently reported that these relief funds are about to be exhausted, and there are still many unfinished projects, and the number of workers awaiting relief is substantial. If provisions are not made soon, the weak will inevitably die one after another, and the desperate may even resort to taking risks. Considering the future, it is truly heartbreaking. In addition to investigating and distributing urgent relief, it seems necessary to simultaneously organize work relief, combining both approaches for comprehensive assistance. However, near the city gate, there are still several thousand elderly, weak, and disabled individuals who are unable to work, and the urgent relief funds cannot be distributed immediately because the investigation throughout the county has not yet been completed. They are barely alive and desperately in need of help. We plan to start by dividing the urban area into units for household investigation and provide each person with four liang of rice per day, with half rations for smaller children, to be collected every four days. In addition, large tickets will still be issued for rice collection, with the deadline being the date of issuing large tickets for the entire county. In this way, those waiting to die can have their lives prolonged. The outer districts are remote and vast, making it impossible to do the same. We can only try to save as many lives as possible. The funds for this small-scale rice relief will be drawn from the large-scale relief, and we hope that funds for work relief can be found separately."</p>
<h3>Hsieh Ta Industrial Company Self-Manufactures New "Hsieh Ching" Steamer</h3>
<p>Traveling Between Sichuan and Shanghai</p>
<p>The Hsieh Ta Industrial Company, recognizing the need for commercial navigation between Sichuan and Shanghai, has specially established a factory to oversee the construction of the new "Hsieh Ching" steamer, which has now been completed. It was launched yesterday and is undergoing trials today. The hull is constructed of selected high-quality steel materials, making it exceptionally sturdy. The design is novel, featuring the streamlined shape that is currently popular, making it a pioneering effort among Chinese navigating vessels. The ship is 143 feet long, 26 feet wide, and has a draft of over six feet. The boiler uses British herringbone machinery, with a horsepower of 1,400. The speed is 14.5 nautical miles per hour. The total tonnage is over 500 tons. The cabins and sanitary facilities are all carefully designed, luxurious, and exquisite, providing passengers with convenience. It can be called the only fast steamer operating on the Sichuan River. The ship was built by the Hsieh Ta Company's own shipyard. The factory manager Wu Fuqing and engineer Liu Fupei have rich experience and superior skills in design, drafting, and planning shipbuilding projects. The construction of this new steamer can be called an immortal achievement. It is reported that the ship is scheduled to begin its maiden voyage on the 20th.</p>

<h3>Gaoqiao Agricultural Improvement Association Appeals for Funds to Repair Embankment</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau Officially Approves</p>

<h3>Extremely Tragic: Four Houses Destroyed and Six Lives Lost in Fudeli, Wuzhen, Zhabei</h3>
<p>Li Youzhi's Wife and Children All Died; No Survivors Among Three Tenants; Five Bodies Have Been Found; Ding Wenyuan Dies of Fright While Fleeing</p>
<p>At around 1:50 a.m. yesterday, a fire broke out on the ground floor of the home of Xie Songtao (also known as Jianzhang), the sub-landlord, at No. 13, Lane 1, Fudeli, opposite the small vegetable market on Wuzhen Road, Zhabei, for reasons unknown. At that time, the residents were already asleep and unable to escape, resulting in many being buried in the fire. According to investigations, a total of three families lived in the house. The front building was rented to Li Youzhi, who currently works for a fire brigade and as a foreman at the North Railway Station. Li is 36 years old, from Hubei, and has a wife, Wang, 35 years old, and two sons, Jinlong, 8 years old, and Shunlong, 5 years old. Wang and her two sons were unable to escape and tragically died in the fire. Li was spared because he was serving at the railway station. When he heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, it was too late to rescue them. As the fire raged, fire brigades from all sections of Zhabei rushed to the scene to extinguish it. Fire brigades from the concession also drove their fire engines to the south of the Wuzhen Road bridge to assist. In the end, four houses were destroyed, including No. 13, No. 14 (including the overpass), No. 12 (a clothing store), and No. 11 (a residence). In addition to Li's wife and two sons who died tragically in the house where the fire started at No. 13, the whereabouts of the family members of the sub-landlord Xie Jianzhang are unknown. The three tenants downstairs, whose names are unknown, also have no survivors. By evening, five bodies of various sizes had been found, all charred beyond recognition. When the Shanghai Local Court sent a prosecutor to the scene for inspection at around 5 p.m., only four bodies were found. Another body was found later, so the coroner's report was not filled out, and the local security guard, Shen Xiaowu, was ordered to wait until all the bodies were found before re-examining them tomorrow (i.e., today). After the fire broke out, Ding Wenyuan, a 75-year-old resident of No. 15, Lane 2 (the next lane), from Suzhou, led his family out with their luggage and other items. Because there were still items left in the house that he hadn't taken out, he died of fright. His body is currently placed in the main room of No. 15. The police station has taken several people, including the lane supervisor and suspects Xu Daosheng, Zhang Taotao, and Liu Tanghe, into custody for questioning.</p>
<h3>Journalists Association Requests Punishment Be Rescinded</h3>
<p>Sixteenth Bund Police Officer Rude: What Protection Do Journalists Have?</p>
<p>Qu Yicheng, a member of the city's Journalists Association, reported that he was obstructed from performing his duties while covering news by a police officer from the Sixteenth Bund. The association resolved to send a letter to Cai Jinjun, the police chief of the city, requesting a thorough investigation. The original letter is quoted below: "To Director Cai Jinjun: According to a letter from member Qu Yicheng, when the newly appointed Chairman of Guangdong Wu Tiecheng inspected the honor guard in Nanshi on the morning of the 10th of this month before his departure, Yicheng went to cover the news. When his car reached the junction of the Sixteenth Bund and the French Concession, he was stopped by a police officer. Yicheng immediately got out of the car, explained the situation, and showed his press card. However, the police officer was very rude and even punched Yicheng in the waist, and then took Yicheng to Huang Qiguang, the head of the local branch, who did not ask about the situation and scolded Yicheng. Although Yicheng tried his best to explain, they turned a deaf ear and were completely unreasonable. Even if the area was temporarily under security control, the branch head and others who were ordered to manage traffic should not abuse their power and arbitrarily insult pedestrians. Moreover, Yicheng was not the only journalist who went to the area at the same time. Yicheng got out of the car to explain, but was unreasonably stopped. The branch head treated journalists with such an attitude, even allowing the police officer to assault someone without stopping him. What protection will journalists have when covering news in the future? Therefore, we are writing to you about the situation and requesting an investigation. Shanghai is a city of international importance and should set an example for the whole country. Police officers bear the responsibility for local security and should follow the law and serve as a model for the people. However, Huang Qiguang and others from the Sixteenth Bund Police Branch dared to openly disregard etiquette and assault journalists in front of the public. It is easy to imagine how they usually abuse their power and harm the citizens. This not only betrays your efforts to govern diligently but also goes against the highest leader's clear instructions to promote propriety and justice. We request that you severely punish the police officer to appease public anger and for the sake of justice. Respectfully, to Cai, the police chief of Shanghai."</p>

<h3>Gang Robs Geese at Dada Wharf, Criminals Apprehended</h3>
<p>Police Open Fire on Gang Members, Apprehending Criminals and Sending Them to Court</p>
<p>Xie Xing Wild Game Shop on Nanxun Road in the Public Concession sent employee Chen Fayin to the Maoli ship at Dada Wharf in Nanshi at around 1 a.m. on the 11th of this month to pick up 1,163 geese (commonly known as bamboo chickens, with pointed beaks and delicious taste, a delicacy among wild game) from merchants Shen Dagen and others. They were packed in three burlap sacks. When he hired a boat to transport them ashore, he was suddenly met by five gang members at the wharf who kidnapped the merchants Shen Dagen and all the geese to Pudong, demanding that Chen return to the shop to prepare a 50 yuan ransom to redeem them. Chen and another merchant reported the incident to the Maritime Customs Police Station, which sent a detective disguised as the shop owner to negotiate, and dispatched several other detectives to follow behind to apprehend them. The gang members were hiding under the floating bridge at Yangjiadu Wharf. Only Lin Maotang came out to meet them, and the detective lured him onto the boat and arrested him. The criminal resisted and shouted for help from other gang members, who opened fire. The detective also fired back, and stray bullets wounded Lin and Chen Fayin in the foot. Lin was familiar with the water and tried to escape into Pudong but was surrounded and captured by detectives who arrived as reinforcements. Two days later, accomplices Zhou Xiaohou and Liang Shixiu (i.e., Xiao Meng) were apprehended. After strict interrogation, it was discovered that the wanted criminals Liu Jinfu (i.e., Xiao Jinfu) and Yang Hengsheng (i.e., Xiao Wuzi) from Yangzhou were also arrested on the Yangjiadu Xiaopudong and Jiangjiang Riverfront the previous night. Three bags of geese were recovered and taken back to the police station. They confessed that the case was initiated by Lin, who had taken a bath in a bathhouse in Yangjiadu, Pudong, and said that a ship from Zhoushan would arrive in Shanghai that night and someone would be smuggling salt, so they could rob it and extort 50 or 60 yuan. They then hired Zhou's boat and planned to rob the Maoli ship. They encountered the plaintiff's birds, and Liang posed as a health bureau inspector, and Lin and Liu boarded the plaintiff's boat and claimed that the geese violated bureau regulations, and then took action to rob the merchants and goods and extort 50 yuan. The head of the police station verified the confessions and stated that all five defendants in the case had been arrested. Yesterday afternoon, the Xie Xing shop owner Liu Yougui, who was from Ningbo, and three other employees, including Chen Fayin, were summoned, along with the five criminals, to be sent to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Ma A'gen Kills Out of Jealousy, Wu Suzhen Examined Yesterday</h3>
<p>Police Prosecute for Murder, Prosecutor Examines Body and Hands It Over to Sister</p>
<p>The incident of Ma A'gen stabbing his mistress Wu Suzhen to death was reported in yesterday's newspaper. We have now learned that at around 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, Ma went to Wu's house. While they were talking, Wu's older brother arrived and asked Wu to go to the boat on Suzhou Creek to retrieve some items. Wu agreed and asked Ma to leave quickly. Ma, believing that Wu had changed her mind, became enraged and secretly followed her. When Wu returned with a robe, a foreign knife, and a pair of leather shoes, Ma immediately stepped forward and snatched the foreign knife, trying to tear the robe. Wu refused, and a dispute arose. Ma suddenly stabbed Wu Suzhen in the chest with the foreign knife, penetrating several inches, causing her to bleed profusely and fall to the ground. Seeing that he had caused trouble, Ma turned the knife and stabbed himself in the neck three times, also injuring himself and falling to the ground. Someone reported the incident to Chinese Constable No. 2688, who reported it to the Huishi Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Shen Dehui and an ambulance to transport the injured separately to Tongren Hospital. Wu died within minutes due to the injury to a vital organ, and her body was sent to the coroner's office. Ma was kept in the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a public prosecution with the First Special Court for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code, stating the above circumstances and presenting the murder weapon to the court. Judge Lin questioned the witnesses Yang Zhou and Zheng Xiuhua about the situation at the time. The case was adjourned to the 26th, pending Ma A'gen's recovery. The prosecutor Zhang Zongru and a clerk went to the coroner's office to examine the body and determined that the deceased Wu Suzhen, a female, had died from a knife wound inflicted before death. The body was handed over to her sister Li Wu, who signed for it.</p>

<h3>Three Defendants in the Zhao Tieqiao Assassination Case Deny Charges Yesterday</h3>
<p>Garrison Headquarters Believes Evidence of Crime Insufficient, Zhou Zhizhang Retracts Confession, Wang Hong Allowed Bail</p>
<p>Zhao Tieqiao, the former director of the China Merchants Bureau, was shot on the morning of July 24, 1930, at 9 a.m., when he left his home at No. 4, Lane 163, Luban Road, with his wife and bodyguard Liu Hua, and was traveling in his private car number 7347 to the bureau to work. As he arrived at the bureau and was about to enter, someone shot him from the side, and he was wounded in a vital part of his body. The murderer escaped. Zhao died that night due to his injuries. After the case occurred, the Shanghai Police Bureau arrested two suspects, Wang Jinshan and Xia Shaoen, on September 19, and they were convicted by the Shanghai Local Court. The Chinese Detective Chief Liu Junqing and Detective Li Shugui of the Public Concession also arrested four accomplices between June and July 1933: the lawyer Wang Shuqiao (the brother of Wang Yaqiao, the leader of the assassination gang), and Zhou Zhizhang (also known as Xuan Si), Hong Yaodou, Niu Anru, and others from Anhui, and filed a public prosecution with the First Special District Court. The Municipal Police Bureau believed that Wang and others were suspected of murdering a certain important person in the interior and requested that the First Special Court transfer the case for investigation. During the investigation, Niu Anru escaped while the guards were lax and has not been apprehended to this day. Wang, Hong, and Zhou were sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for investigation, but they were not punished because the evidence of the crime was insufficient. The Garrison Headquarters recently sent Wang Shuqiao, Zhou Zhizhang, and Hong Yaodou (Hong was granted bail by the Garrison Headquarters) back to the First Special Court. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division, opened Criminal Court One to question them. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the case and claimed that after the police arrested the defendants, they prosecuted them in accordance with Article 282 of the old Criminal Code, but the old Criminal Code had been abolished, so they now prosecuted them for murder under Article 271 of the new Criminal Code. The bodyguard of the victim Zhao Tieqiao, Liu Hua, and the driver Shen A'san, could no longer be contacted. As for the defendant Zhou Zhizhang, he had confessed to the murder of Zhao at the police station and led the detectives to the scene of the crime to reconstruct it. The defendant's confession had already been presented to the court and should be consulted. Qian then questioned Zhou Zhizhang, but Zhou denied his previous confession, claiming that it had been obtained through torture. Wang Shuqiao and Hong Yaodou also completely denied the charges. Qian verified the confessions and ordered that Xia Shaoen and Wang Jinshan, who had already been convicted by the Local Court, be brought to court for further questioning. The case was adjourned for one week. Wang Shuqiao was allowed to post a 5,000 yuan bond, while Hong Yaodou's bond from the Garrison Headquarters was not applicable and he had to post a separate 2,000 yuan bond. Zhou Zhizhang was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Defendant in the Case of the Plaque with the Forged Chairman Lin's Inscription Presents Evidence to Explain</h3>
<p>Blame Not on Qu Jinshan, Court Debate Investigates Further</p>
<p>Qu Jinshan, a Jiangbei tycoon residing in Rihuigang, Shanghai South, was suspected of murdering Wang, the wife of Xue Zhao, from Yancheng, in the autumn of 1935. The police sent Qu to the local court, where Judge Shao Qin sentenced Qu to life imprisonment. Qu appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, which overturned the unjust verdict and declared him innocent. When Qu was released from prison and returned home, a group of Jiangbei compatriots contributed money to celebrate Qu's release and ward off bad luck, and presented him with a plaque inscribed with the words "Noble Character." The inscription falsely stated the name of Chairman Lin of the National Government and was stamped with an inappropriate "Central Chairman's Seal" to show off wealth. Xue Zhao learned of this and filed a complaint with the local court, accusing Qu Jinshan and Cao Da Wu, who presented the plaque, of forging seals and falsely claiming to be Chairman Lin to deceive and swindle. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang investigated and determined that there was clear evidence, and filed a public prosecution for forgery. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Yizu opened court to hear the case. The plaintiff Xue Zhao did not appear, but the defendant Qu Jinshan was ill and returned to his hometown, and was represented by his defense lawyer Xue Lisheng. He argued that according to Cao Da Wu's confession, Qu Jinshan had been falsely accused of murder and had been unjustly acquitted, so dozens of fellow villagers initiated the presentation of this plaque. However, when they ordered the plaque from the paint shop, they did not ask for it to be inscribed with Chairman Lin's name. When the plaque was completed, they suddenly discovered the words "Chairman Lin" and repeatedly negotiated with the shop owner, Chen Changji. Chen Changji not only refused to comply but also boasted that he would be responsible if anything happened in the future. Now I have also found out that Chen Changji has made similar plaques for others, and I have taken photos of them to present to the court for investigation. Therefore, the blame is not on us, etc. The court debate was adjourned for further investigation. Cao Da Wu was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Doctor Receives Series of Threatening Letters Involving Apprentice and Shop Owner</h3>
<p>Lin Xianshang Carries Paper Package, Zhang Zixiang Released on Bail Awaiting Further Investigation</p>
<p>Dr. Qu, who resides at No. 93, Huanglu Road at the end of North Sichuan Road, has a modest income and is coveted by criminals. Between the 5th and 12th of this month, he received several letters claiming to be from Sheng, a student at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, demanding 2,000 gold yuan as a birthday gift, otherwise he would face drastic measures. Unable to bear the harassment, he contacted the police, and the final meeting place was in front of a cigarette shop on the same road (No. 93 Huanglu Road is located in the Chinese area). He reported this to the Municipal Police Bureau, which dispatched Detective Wu Peisheng to secretly wait at the location and arrest Lin Xianshang (16 years old), a native of Ningbo. He was taken into custody and confessed that he was an apprentice at the Yong'an Electric Shop at No. 466, Haining Road, and that a customer surnamed Wang, one of the shop owner Zhang Zixiang's five customers from Ningbo, had asked him to carry the paper package, but he did not know its contents. Detective Wu rushed to the address and asked Zhang Zixiang about the customer surnamed Wang. Zhang claimed that there was such a person, but he had already fled after hearing the news. Zhang was suspected of being involved in the matter. It was reported to the Hongkou Police Station, which sent police officers to bring him to the station. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the situation and claimed that after investigation, Zhang Zixiang was not involved in this matter and requested that the court allow him to be released on bail pending further investigation. Zhang Zixiang confessed that the customer surnamed Wang had come and said that he wanted to install electric lights and asked Lin, the apprentice, to go with him to get a paper package, and he was completely unaware that it was a threatening letter. He asked for leniency. Lin, the apprentice, said the same thing. Judge Xiao allowed Zhang Zixiang to provide a shop guarantee to be summoned at any time and sent him to the Municipal Police Bureau pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhu Zhenkang and Sun Meitang, a Case of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>The Defendant Claims No Embezzlement Occurred; Official Orders Rescheduled Hearing for the 21st</p>
<p>Sun Meitang, the owner of the Meihuali Watch Shop on Nanjing Road and a native of Ningbo, was sued in the Special No. 1 Criminal Court by Zhu Zhenkang and Wang Lingfu (i.e., Gongji), also natives of Ningbo, through their lawyers, on charges of embezzlement. The indictment stated that Sun Meitang, as a managing director of the Ningshao Shipping Company, misappropriated company funds amounting to 100,933.54 yuan and 45,462.37 yuan in the name of the Meihuali headquarters via the Yingzhen Da Silver Company in 1935. Proof of this could be found in the money exchange's final statements and the general ledger of transactions. It was evident that the Da Meihuali, etc., were all opened by the defendant for his own benefit. The prosecutors requested a thorough investigation of the case. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng of Criminal Division 8 summoned Sun Meitang, the defendant, who was represented by lawyers Liu Chun and Lu Shuang. Zhu Zhenkang, the plaintiff, stated that he was a clerk at Ningshao Company with one share of stock worth 25 yuan. Wang Lingfu, the editor of the Ningshao Weekly, was also a shareholder. They filed the lawsuit because of the defendant's embezzlement. Sun Meitang stated in his defense that there was no embezzlement and that the Zhenda Silver Company and Meihuali headquarters had always had dealings with Ningshao, as evidenced by the ledgers. Currently, Zhenda owes Ningshao over 120,000 yuan, and Meihuali owes Ningshao over 40,000 yuan. He acknowledged that he owned both Zhenda and Meihuali. Judge Huang adjourned the case until the 21st for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Unauthorized Use of Blank Signed Statements; Withdrawal of Private Prosecution Dispute</h3>
<p>Shen Baoyi Sues Huang Jue; Official Orders an Arrest Warrant</p>
<p>Shen Baoyi, a 46-year-old local resident living at No. 4, Xinfu Lane, Galler Road, French Concession, was formerly a clerk for lawyer Huang Jue (from Suzhou). Due to a dispute over funds, Shen filed a private prosecution against Huang in the Special No. 2 Court, accusing him of issuing bad checks and using Shen's name to withdraw the private prosecution from the court without receiving full payment. After learning of this, Shen filed another private prosecution in the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Huang of forging documents. The case has been delayed for several years. Yesterday, Judge Chen Shuo of Criminal Division 2 summoned the parties. The defendant, Huang Jue, did not appear. Only the plaintiff was present and stated that Huang had asked his clerk, surnamed Pan, to negotiate a settlement in the case of issuing bad checks. Huang first returned 50 yuan in foreign currency, promising to pay the remaining balance before the court hearing. Both parties agreed that Shen would withdraw the private prosecution after the full payment was made. However, Huang did not pay the full amount but instead used a blank signed document Shen had previously entrusted him with handling during negotiations with a sock factory, writing a statement in Shen's name to withdraw the private prosecution from the court. Therefore, he is now suing Huang for forgery. The judge stated that the court received a statement saying that the defendant was a lawyer in Suzhou. The court entrusted the Wu County local court to deliver the summons. The defendant received the summons but did not appear today. The court will issue an arrest warrant for the defendant to appear in court and reschedule the hearing.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Burglary Case of the Jiang Wang Family Opened for Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tian Changlin and Others Confess; Guo and Xu Deny</p>
<p>The case of the robbery and burglary at the home of Jiang Wang, a Ningbo woman living at No. 4, Shoululi, Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, which occurred in September of last year, has resulted in the arrest of three robbers by the French police: Tian Linchang, Wang Acai, and Yang Changgen (aka Gaobitou Changgen). They confessed that Guo Hongqing (aka Xiao Hong), the owner of a vegetable shop, instigated the crime, and Xu Chunde (who works in a blanket shop) from Nanjing provided the firearms. The detectives subsequently arrested Guo and Xu and transferred them to the Special No. 2 Court. Judge Sun Pengxian questioned them several times. According to Wang Acai, someone in the holding cell asked a patrol officer to deliver a message to Guo Hongqing, asking him to retract his confession. Details of the court's decision to reschedule the hearing to investigate were published in this newspaper. It is now known that the message was delivered by a Chinese police officer with badge number 344. The police station has been notified and will dismiss the officer. Yesterday, Judge Sun continued the hearing of the robbery case in Criminal Division 1. According to the victim, Jiang Wang, she was robbed of a small silver lockbox containing over 80 yuan in cash, over 70 yuan in banknotes, and jewelry worth over 300 yuan in total. Tian Linchang confessed that the three of them went to commit the robbery together, then went to pawn the goods together. Guo did not go but they split up at the Luo Chung Ge Restaurant. Wang Acai confessed that he returned one of the guns to Guo Hongqing after the robbery. The other gun was taken by Xiao Chongming. Yang Changgen also confessed to participating in the robbery. Guo denied instigating the crime or providing the firearms. Xu claimed that Wang Acai was not his disciple and that he used to run the Central Dance School in the Taichang Building on Zhejiang Road. Wang came to cause trouble and was slapped by his wife, so Wang is now falsely accusing him out of spite. Guo and Xu hired lawyers Wang Shizong and Yu Hualong to represent them. The court adjourned the case until the 23rd for further hearing. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Daughter-in-Law Sues Father-in-Law for Abandonment and Support</h3>
<p>Wu Linbing Bitterly Complains of Insults and Abuse; Wu Zhiyuan's Defense Attorney Refutes Point by Point</p>
<p>The young woman Wu Linbing, through her lawyer Xi Shichang, filed a lawsuit in the local court against her father-in-law, Wu Zhiyuan, accusing him of malicious abandonment, refusal to provide support, withholding her dowry and jewelry, and concealing inheritance. She requested a comprehensive judgment. Judge Zhang Jin opened the hearing yesterday afternoon. Neither party appeared in person. Lawyer Xi represented the plaintiff and stated the plaintiff's claims: The plaintiff, 23 years old, residing at No. 76, Shangwen Road, is the third daughter of Lin Kanghou. In the spring of 1935, the defendant's father, Wu Shaotang, arranged for matchmakers Huang and Hu Zonglu to visit her family, proposing marriage between his grandson, Wu Guangrong, the defendant's eldest son, and the plaintiff for the sake of</p>
<p>Establishing Affection</p>
<p>The plaintiff's father agreed because Shaotang was a prominent dye merchant with a reputable reputation. On September 17 of that year, they were engaged, and on October 18, they married at the Xin Ya Restaurant. Three generations of the family lived together at No. 458, Lafayette Road.</p>
<p>The Grandfather Managed</p>
<p>the household. The grandfather treated the plaintiff as his own daughter and provided her with 300 yuan per month for personal expenses. Unfortunately, the grandfather passed away on December 21, 1935. During his lifetime, the grandfather knew his son's eccentric nature and, because the plaintiff's husband was born to the defendant's previous wife, feared discrimination from a stepmother. He instructed the young couple to live separately at No. 666 on the same road to avoid conflict, providing them with 400 yuan per month for living expenses. Unexpectedly, the defendant, having long harbored resentment for the grandfather's affection for his grandson's wife,</p>
<p>Released Accumulated Resentment</p>
<p>During the mourning period, he insulted and cursed the plaintiff every time she came home. Knowing proper etiquette, the plaintiff remained silent and did not argue. However, two or three months later, her husband, Guangrong, also became depressed due to the defendant and stepmother's discrimination, triggering old illnesses. Doctors diagnosed him with tuberculosis and heart disease. The plaintiff was alarmed and informed the defendant, asking him to find a way to treat him, but he ignored her. Furthermore, he</p>
<p>Stopped Providing Payments</p>
<p>from March 1936. She had to borrow money from her mother's family and relatives to pay for her husband's medical expenses, spending over 7,000 yuan at Dahua Hospital, Moganshan Tuberculosis Sanatorium, and Hangzhou Shanghai Chinese and Western Sanatoriums, among others. The defendant not only rarely visited but also</p>
<p>Cursed Him to Die</p>
<p>and called the plaintiff a vixen who had caused the problem. On July 13 and September 1, 1936, when she asked for money, she was thrown out of the house and disowned. The extent of his insults and abuse was particularly severe when the plaintiff's father was visiting Siam. On September 22, the defendant brought the plaintiff's husband back from the Chinese and Western Sanatorium but refused to allow the plaintiff to see him. He did not inform her even when he was critically ill and secretly</p>
<p>Stole All of Her Dowry</p>
<p>from No. 666 while she was at her mother's house. The plaintiff's husband passed away on October 31. The next morning, they informed her, causing her great shock and fainting. She was sent to Shanghai Tuberculosis Sanatorium for treatment by her mother's family and remained in bed for two months. The husband's family never came to visit. Now, she is in a predicament and utterly destitute. The defendant, on the other hand, possesses millions and has only two sons. The eldest son has passed away, leaving only one son. Therefore, she</p>
<p>Requests the Court to Order</p>
<p>(1) The defendant to pay a lump sum of 50,000 yuan for living expenses. (2) To supplement the living expenses from March 1936 to February 1937, twelve months at 400 yuan per month, totaling 4,800 yuan. (3) To return the engagement diamond ring (valued at 1,500 yuan), two diamond bracelets (valued at 4,000 yuan), and a pair of diamond earrings (valued at 1,500 yuan). (4) To return the 2,000 yuan passbook No. 1671 from the Lai Bank. (5) To return all of the dowry that was moved away (valued at 3,000 yuan). (6) To grant preliminary execution of items 1 and 2. (7) To return the 2,000 yuan she paid in advance for her late husband's debts. The defendant, represented by lawyers He and others, claimed that the defendant resided at No. 458, Lafayette Road, and</p>
<p>Filed a Countersuit</p>
<p>Stating that (1) there was no abuse by the stepmother and they never lived together. (2) The plaintiff frequented dance halls and was extremely modern. The defendant's father became ill and died due to anger. The plaintiff not only failed to care for her deceased husband, Guangrong, but also took all of his jewelry and savings of 4,000 yuan. (3) Guangrong's lung disease was not genuine, and the defendant bore all of the medical expenses, with evidence to prove it. (4) The defendant's father never promised her 400 yuan, and he was old and did not manage the household. (5) She has no need for living expenses since</p>
<p>Her Family Supports Her</p>
<p>and that all of the jewelry was taken away by the plaintiff, leaving only wooden furniture. At the time, Guangrong was extremely angry and wanted to report it to the police, but the defendant felt that family scandals should not be aired publicly. The plaintiff often abandoned her home and neglected her duties. Therefore, he requests that the original complaint be dismissed and that she return the 3,880 yuan in savings. The judge, recognizing that both parties were people of status, suggested that they first try to settle the matter outside of court. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3>World Encyclopedia Exhibition Opens Yesterday</h3>
<p>The World Encyclopedia Exhibition opened today at the Grand Auditorium of the China International Association on Ferguson Road. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, a formal opening reception was held for various sectors of the city, attended by over a hundred guests including Wei Daoming and Tao Xuan. The encyclopedia exhibit includes a total of 450 types from 11 countries and 39 participating institutions, truly an unprecedented event in the Chinese cultural world. The following is an excerpt from Mr. Li Shizeng's opening speech: This exhibition is jointly prepared by the World Society, World Academy, China International , World Encyclopedia Editorial Committee, and World Cooperative Publishing Association, with the cooperation of various consulates and other parties. I, on behalf of the four organizing bodies, would like to thank all the collaborating parties. As for the motivation for this exhibition, I should also briefly report to all the guests. China International has always strived for international cultural cooperation, so its collection focuses on international issues, but it also pays attention to the progress of world scholarship, and has collected various periodicals. In recent years, the encyclopedia has become an essential tool for our scholarship, so we plan to make various world encyclopedias the mainstay of our collection. Recently, several encyclopedias were shipped from Europe, so we took the opportunity to solicit domestic collections for a combined exhibition to attract the attention of the Chinese academic community. Here, I must mention that Diderot of France and Ji Xiaolan of China are the two great encyclopedia creators in the world. Their lifelong efforts and contributions to the academic world of the recent century deserve our commemoration. Therefore, in this exhibition, we will also combine their relics for display and publish "Sixty Modern Celebrities" and "Ji Xiaolan" separately as a memorial. Inspired by the efforts of the ancients, such as Diderot and Ji, and the efforts of various countries in the world, such as the various encyclopedias on display today, I cannot help but feel that those of us who compile the world encyclopedia should work even harder, etc.</p>
<h3>Female Passenger Injured on French Concession Bus</h3>

<p>Huadong News Agency reports that at 1:40 PM the day before yesterday, a young woman fell from a French Concession Route 21 bus at the intersection of Beile Road and Pubo Road and lost consciousness. The woman, the wife of a Mr. Zhang residing at No. 13, Lane 20, West Ames Road, was helped up by her companion and taken to the hospital, where she was found to be seriously injured. The female passenger boarded the bus at the intersection of Jinshenfu Road and West Ames Road, buying a ticket to the intersection of Beile Road and Pubo Road. Unfamiliar with the route, she asked ticket seller No. 154 to ring the bell when they arrived at the station so she could get off. However, although the ticket seller rang the bell and the bus stopped, driver No. 188 ignored it, disobeying the regulations, and continued driving past the stop, instead driving towards the entrance of the Wenyuanzhai store at No. 416 on the opposite side of the road. As a result, after the ticket seller rang the bell, the bus door was opened, and the female passenger stood at the door waiting to get off. Seeing that the bus did not stop at the station, she panicked and was further shaken by the turning of the bus, losing her balance and falling. The driver did not stop the bus even after the accident. Only after her companion shouted wildly did he finally brake, causing a major accident. The driver claims that within the writing interval, the driver has the right to stop anywhere. The injured woman's family believes that the individual accident is a small matter, while the danger to travelers is a major matter, so they are gathering witnesses and will negotiate with the company to improve the situation.</p>

<p>Mrs. He Yingqin Cuts the Ribbon</p>
<p>Daxia New Village, sponsored by Daxia University in West Shanghai, is a residential area for the university's faculty, staff, and alumni. It has been gradually expanded to cover more than 200 acres, becoming a large new village in Shanghai. Last autumn, a bridge was built near the Liwa Lida Village on the school's river, named the Li Hong Bridge, taking the meaning from the Tang poem "double bridges falling rainbow" and the common name of the river, Liwa Lida River. The name was inscribed by He Yingqin, a village friend. The bridge is 120 feet long and 25 feet wide, built with steel and concrete, strong and beautiful, adding much to the school scenery and facilitating traffic. The bridge was completed at the end of last month. Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, a completion ceremony was held. The New Village Committee of the school invited village friends to attend the ceremony, and Mrs. He Yingqin cut the ribbon. Flags were hung on the bridge, firecrackers were set off, and the onlookers were crowded, making it a grand occasion.</p>

This morning, the society plans to hold a charity social gathering on the evening of May 19th at the Paramount Hotel.

<h3>Ying Qingpo Dies in Toilet</h3>
<p>Ying Qingpo, a native of Ningbo, was in his forties. He used to solicit clothing business for British naval vessels, but he became impoverished due to opium addiction. He made a living by borrowing money and had been seriously ill. Yesterday afternoon, he took his son (about eleven or twelve years old) to the latrine at No. 37, Jiucang Street, inside the Old North Gate. Unexpectedly, his old illness relapsed and he died suddenly.

Chen Zhaoming, the caretaker of the latrine, has reported it to the police station for verification.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>A Scoundrel of the Press: Yun Hai</h3>
<h3>Yun Hai</h3>
<p>The news business is a sacred and lofty undertaking, and its practitioners are the most loyal servants of society, reporting factual news in a purely objective manner. Therefore, it was once said that journalists are "uncrowned emperors," alluding to their relentless exposure of darkness. However, it goes without saying that this sacred profession has now been tainted by this awkward society. The so-called "environmental factors" serve as a perfect curtain, concealing the conscience of reporters. A journalist who dares to speak truthfully finds that misfortune accompanies their work. We have seen many examples of this in past news reports about journalists, which I will not list here one by one.</p>
<p>However, even with these "environmental factors," the situation is still "passive"; the news business has not been completely swallowed up. Yet now, we are actually witnessing a portion of shameless journalists who have sold their souls and disgraced the entire news profession. Especially from the perspective of those of us in the same industry, this should be subjected to severe condemnation and moral sanctions.</p>
<p>Now, in Shanghai, we have already seen the resolution of the Journalists Association: "Regarding the case of a portion of reporters in Beiping organizing a delegation to visit Japan and the puppet regime, the Association should issue a stern warning. It is resolved that the Association will issue a declaration denouncing the delegation's actions." However, this is only in Shanghai. Other colleagues in other regions have not yet fully expressed their views. Especially those righteous journalists in Beiping, apart from those who are akin to "traitors," should, for the sake of the reputation of the news industry, take effective action against the shameless behavior of these sycophantic reporters.</p>
<p>At the same time, merely issuing a declaration to "denounce" is still not enough, because this shameless behavior has the following special significance:</p>
<p>First, the organization, establishment, and even the expenses of this delegation are all sponsored and provided by the other party. The delegation's advisor is also an individual from the other side. Even if we put it mildly, it will probably be unavoidable to sing praises upon their return from the visit. From the perspective of journalistic ethics, this is already a betrayal.</p>
<p>Secondly, since it is called a "Japan-puppet regime delegation," of course, in addition to Japan, they also have to go to "puppet Manchuria." Not recognizing the existence of the "puppet state" is not only the indignant cry in the hearts of our authorities and our people, but it has also become a firm belief internationally. This "portion" of sycophantic reporters actually hoisted the flag and went to the "puppet state" for an inspection. This is not only a tremendous disgrace to our colleagues, but it is simply a shameless act of national traitors who are forfeiting sovereignty and humiliating the country.</p>
<p>Due to the above two points, we cannot help but express our views on this kind of shameless failure. And this expression should not only come from colleagues in the news industry, but also from all righteous people of the Republic of China, who should actively condemn this group of journalistic scum, the running dogs of foreign powers.</p>

<h3>Outside the Circle of Civilization</h3>
<p>— Ye Jiayi</p>
<p>— Notes from a Stroll —</p>
<p>They, they do not lack the faculties that humans should have, but they do not have the rights that humans should have. What is called the civilization of this era is only more cruel to them!</p>
<p>They are said to live on this earth, but God did not give them a piece of land to live on. The grandfather is like this, and the children are also like this: they only tidy up a dilapidated small boat on the banks of a black, foul-smelling river to build their eternal home. But it is not like the magnificent and adventurous life of boatmen living on the sea.</p>
<p>The home on the narrow boat is the sacred place where their children are born, and also the ancestral hall where their ancestors breathe their last, the place where their property (?) is entrusted, and also the garden where they rest; they live in this piece of land (no, it should not be called land) from birth to death, in this place less than four zhang long. Every day, they climb in and out of a porthole. The father lives on following the destiny that the grandfather's legacy gave them; the children also grow up following the father. Generation after generation... Although the people of another world enjoy human happiness through so-called science, they can no longer make this home prosperous: they even worry all day long that the progress of "civilization" will one day destroy their home.</p>
<p>If a person with the heart of Buddha were to walk through these caves, also called humanity, for the first time, I don't know how they would go about practicing asceticism? Really, who can believe that this is also a corner of the human world? Nearby are tall Western-style buildings, where groups of men and women in suits and dresses, with powdered faces and painted eyebrows, are enjoying higher education, while on the river, many commodities are shipped back and forth on steamships every day. A magnificent iron bridge is also erected across it, and things like pythons scream and crawl across it in the morning and afternoon. In the rows of houses across the way, the sound of wheels echoes day and night, and all the supplies of the human world are manufactured quickly. These, doesn't this show that the world is not simple, crude, or barbaric? Yet why do a group of ancient humans still remain near this big city...</p>
<p>I can't imagine how they live. But they live the same way, and they seem to be so comfortable. They have the spiritual food that no one can take away, and the souls that civilization cannot destroy: in the evening, when the red sunset shines on the river surface, turning it into countless golden snakes, you can see the old man with a smoking pipe in his mouth leisurely puffing away on his patio - a deck on the bow of the boat - while the children, tied with slings for fear of falling into the river, squat like toads, staring at the light of the sun; and when the mournful roars nearby have stopped, their girls will come back to gather this tiny bit of family warmth. Mutual love makes them all hide their fatigue and pain; they just chew on the bitter fruit and live on!</p>
<p>They can only dream of the civilization in another corner of the city by watching the sky half-lit up by electric lights at night. The men who have returned from the city talk about the women, shops, vehicles, theaters... This will shock these simple souls to the point of disbelief. That world is very close to them, but they cannot go there even once until they die. Because they are creatures born in another world!</p>
<p>A simple life makes up their simple souls. They do not desire anything beyond life. They say that they only hope that their children will grow up and have children of the same fate as them! However, this wish is only for the elderly; the young people, who have lived in the city and been abused by another group of people, and have also heard what the students have said to them, all have a stubborn heart. They raised their fists and cursed the gentlemen: "I will show you what's what one day."</p>
<p>The quiet river ebbs and flows every day, and the blood and sweat of the residents on the riverbank gradually dries up, and it all flows into this black and greasy river. As more and more people die, more and more blood accumulates in the river. In the near future, the young people all believe that they will see a high tide of blood waves surge up in anger...</p>
<p>— One day... they all think so.</p>
<h3>Ramblings of an Old City</h3>
<p>— Yu Ni</p>
<p>The city is old.</p>
<p>— The tail end of the old century. It is the silence of the tombstones in front of the ancient tombs, withering silently. It is the inner sadness of a lonely old man, which will be eroded by depression forever. It is the dark green, sewage-filled gutter. It is still water that will never rise into a burst of wild laughter.</p>
<p>Some lonely filaments that cannot weave dreams float like light smoke forever, but they come back like the density of memories. But they also fade like memories gradually. Below are some of their scattered traces: (some of the most subtle, almost invisible.)</p>
<p>㊀ Shanmu Island</p>
<p>Spring is here.</p>
<p>On this forever desolate sandbar, the green grass smiles pitifully, caressed by the breeze.</p>
<p>Vast:</p>
<p>The sandbar meanders along the Yangtze River, extending far, far away, to the horizon.</p>
<p>The low, thatched houses of reeds forgotten by spring haphazardly dot the vastness, tiny. Crouching low, like a shy woman, covering the holes in her clothes, but who pays attention?</p>
<p>A few willow trees stand in solitude, leaving white marks on their trunks due to the annual flooding of the river.</p>
<p>Under these trees is the old place for shooting criminals. — That desolate gloom permeated with "killing intent" is a heavy nightmare that forever climbs onto and sticks to the hearts of the people in the nearby low houses.</p>
<p>㊁ Artillery Barracks</p>
<p>It used to be an artillery barracks, but now it is desolate. The bricks of the wall are covered with a layer of the dilapidation of wind and rain, and the weeds in the cracks are luxuriant. The doorway is as big as a city gate, but the door has long been stolen by someone.</p>
<p>Inside are some beggars' shelters, and scattered fragments have formed some thatched huts, and the stench will be locked here forever. In the middle of the open space, there are still two artillery pieces standing upright, but they no longer have any ability. The yellow rust is embroidered with patterns all over. Silently, they are used by people as bamboo poles to dry clothes.</p>
<p>Spring rots here and turns into mud under your feet.</p>
<p>Everything is like mud.</p>
<p>No spring breeze. No morning sun. No joy. No sadness.</p>
<p>Rotting silently and without feeling.</p>
<p>㊂ Baiyi Tu</p>
<p>Baiyi Tu is outside the West Gate.</p>
<p>On the hillside, which is full of mounds of graves, there are also some low thatched houses, but this is different.</p>
<p>This place is mysterious:</p>
<p>Young girls and middle-aged women, dressed in clean clothes and pants, lean on firewood fans and beckon passersby!</p>
<p>It's very cheap — a few dozen copper coins will get you a hug.</p>
<p>However, the men in those houses sigh, stitching their eyebrows together in the dark corner. A dry tobacco pouch or a cigarette butt lights up a small red dot in the darkness.</p>
<p>Life is a bag of bitterness.</p>
<p>Some filaments that cannot weave dreams float like light smoke forever. —</p>
<p>Some subtle, inarticulate beats murmur a curse. —</p>
<p>Some depression abandoned by memories will forever form a boundless nightmare to startle the song and praise of the petrel.</p>
<p>The city is old.</p>
<p>— The tail end of the old century.</p>
