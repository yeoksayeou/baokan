<p>時評</p>
<h3>予打擊者以打擊</h3>
<p>— 雍</p>
<p>自前日蒋委員長公表其演詞。而我國家對日軍此次挑覺之態度。遂有堅决之表示。自昨日二十九軍奮力抗戰于蘆溝橋豐台各地。而我國之守土應戰。益有事實上之進展。前乎此者。前鋒接觸。為戰為和。每在疑似之際。迨至今日。序幕旣開。義無返顧。我國蓋已合四萬五千萬之民衆為一人為一心。以與侵略我魚肉我者。决其雌雄于疆塲之上矣。</p>
<p>我國有五千年之文化。凡文明進化者。愛和平。崇禮義。而不尚戰爭。蓋知戰爭能毀減文明。非至絕對相需之際。所不宜輕用者也。世界日趨進化。國際創設機構訂立公約。所以謀弭兵者。其道至周。文明國家。雖以權益之衝突。亦多憚于啟畔。每有折衢。輒托之縱橫捭闔之間。以避免兵禍。而野心家則轉乘人之期望和平。以自逞其擴大慾。如日本之於我國家。自九一八以來。由東三省而熱河。而更進窺我平津。我以和平自策勉。彼則橫加以武力。我以理智相周旋。彼則凌之以兵威。公約則熟視無覩。居間則一切謝絕。逞其野心之極。必欲毀減我歷史。占據我板圖。以打擊為能事。以侵略為故常。使我今日。不得不予打擊者以打擊。出於應戰之途。以自存其國家民族之命脈。在我師直為壯。無待蓍龜。而日本舉國所受之痛苦。何莫非受其野心家之荼毒。天下無孤行暴戾者。可以倖存。則打擊人者所受之打擊。亦固可預知已。</p>
<p>試溯華北之局勢。自熱河淪陷以後。暴力垂及于平津。已且五年。當時我尚以和平自勵。而有塘沽之恊定。期以貫澈對內自存對外共存之初衷。乃日人得寸進尺。必欲置平津于肘腋之下。所幸冀察當局宋哲元氏于絕續之際。力奠大局。艱苦支持我廿九軍忠勇健兒。正受喜峯口冷口諸役之激刺。創夷瘢疽。在在均留誓死報國之紀念。分駐平津。以繼續其守土衛國之職責。推其心跡。不論何時何地。但得為民族為正義而一申其忠悃。則橫刀躍馬孰肯後人。乃不幸復有豐台退駐之一幕。我以委曲為求全。人以無理相煎迫。坐使士兵。揮淚換防。至于今日。含蘊者旣日深。發揮者自益力。宛平孤城廣野。堅拒抗戰。足以覘其機先。為必勝之兆矣。</p>
<p>至蔣委員長對于國家之立塲。夙已三令五申。人所共喻。數年以來。尤莫不以外患為對象。致力于一切軍政之建設。國內各方。旣已體識其忠誠。以趨于統一。而蔣委員長自亦更能積極領導。揩置裕如。宣言昭示。一字一珠。以澈底之解釋。闡國家之立塲。為最低之限度。全民族之生命。其所以領導全國鼓勵人民。乃至宣示日本者。無一語不出諸赤忱。慶頑立懦。聞風而作。敢信我忠勇之國軍將士。乃至全國民衆。必能“抱定犧牲一切之决心”。决不“放棄尺寸土地與主權”以自陷于“中華民族的千古罪人。”可斷言也。</p>

<h3>準戰時的世界軍事費（下）</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>哈生氏所製的表以國際聯盟軍事年鑑等材料為根據、從中可以看出一九三二至一九三六這五年間各國軍事費的增加狀况來、茲照録如下：（單位百萬元）</p>
<p>附註：A包括阿比西尼亞戰費、B與上列三數的合計不符。</p>
<p>就目前的情勢來說。英國，樹立了十五億鎊國防計劃的結果。今年的軍事費，就達大戰前的四倍，法國樹立了總額百九十億佛郎（合國幣約三十二億）的四年國防計劃，今年的軍事費也數倍於大戰以前。德意日蘇美五國擴充軍備的速度，當然也一樣的可驚。至於諸小國，則今年一荷蘭在荷的國防費上，增加了八千萬元的持別費，波蘭向法借了四億元的巨債，以充國內的軍事費，捷克斯拉夫發行了四億元國防公費，他如比利時瑞士，土耳其等國也無不致力國防，大整軍備。</p>
<p>各國擴充軍備的結果民間企業，感受着獲得資本的原料及熟練工人的困難，影響到商品市塲。於是物價飛騰，而國民生活水準也就被迫降低。在另一方面，各國政府為籌措軍事費，祇得募債以補正當財源的不足，因而發生劇烈的信用膨脹，使社會經濟更加陷於不安。總之。各國無限制的擴充軍備。其有引起世界大戰的可能性。即使置之不論。單就其直接的影響來看。也就够使我們感到憂懼了。</p>

<h3>英外相艾登宣布國際政策</h3>
<p>决不參加思想上之集團　英法合作歐洲和平要素</p>
<p>［倫敦］英外相艾登演說第二部份則係說明西班牙問題、對於調整委員會接受英國折衷方案、作為討論基礎之一事表示滿意謂“此項折衷方案、務當使其成功、不然、則各外國勢將加緊干涉西班牙內戰、而歐洲前途將不免引起莫大之危險查去年秋間、此種危險本已存在、幸賴法國前總理判魯姆提議、訂結不干涉協定、危險乃賴以避免、“至是艾登述及地中海問題、謂“英國抱定决心、當保衛地中海之利益、一如其在各地之利益、然不擬將任何他國遂出地中海之外也、總之、英意兩國關於地中海之君子協定、吾人當始終加以信守云繼述及英美兩國訂結商之談判、謂英美兩國均認為此種商約、對於國際貿易之發展、有切實之裨益、述及國際會則稱、一國聯會旣未死亡、亦未至於奄奄一息繼又鄭重聲明、英决定永不參加任何思想上之集團、旣不參加反共產主義之集團、亦不參加反法西斯主義之集團、對於蘇聯與德國日前與英國分別簽訂海軍條約一事、則加以稱道謂俄德兩國志在合作．可於此證之最後艾登詳述英法兩國之友好關係、謂一自西班牙內亂發生十二個月以來、歐洲得平安渡過、並未發生可怖之衝突、實當以英法兩國友誼為其最重要之因素”、結論則稱、“西班牙內亂造成歐洲之重大危機、然歷時十二個月、並未釀成巨變、各國向內戰當事任何一方、即使表示熱烈同情、亦均不願將西國內戰、擴張至西國之外、可見歐洲前途、殊足令人樂觀、一年以前、余希望各方爭執可以和解、和平尚可保全、今余仍抱此種希望、且較前益為濃厚焉”、</p>
<p>艾登外相演說旣畢、首由反對派工黨議員即該黨外交問題專家達爾頓發言、述及遠東局勢、謂渠希望英國協同美國、以維議遠東和平、述及西班牙問題、謂就英國言之、實以限止西班牙國民軍母令騰得為得計、至於地中海方面、若由德意兩國插足其間、則英法兩國與其屬地間之交通線、即將直接感受威脅云、（中央社十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］繼邱吉國稱、直布羅陀四週及鄰近已有西班牙國民軍架設鉅砲、此非西班牙國內戰所監耍之物、倘國民軍領袖弗朗哥有控制直布羅陀及海峽之意、英國殊不能漠視之云、勞合喬治亦稱、此等大砲之力、足以對銷海峽、並稱與弗朗哥接近之法西斯各國中、有一國之意向極為明瞭、即欲藉以控制地中海是也、此等法西斯國家之所以派遺軍隊赴西班牙者、亦即以西班牙能控制地中海之故也、倘蘇作士運河一旦為他人對鎖、則惟一其他道路即可繞行好望角、但倘西班牙為一敵國用作潛艇及空軍根據地時、該道亦將感受威迫云、勞合喬治繼稱、葡萄牙現已在與弗郎哥密切勾結、此親於巴里利克羣島之為法西斯控制、即可知之、倘弗郞哥藉意大利之志願乓及德國之專家及大砲、在西班牙取得勝利、則彼收成為德意聯系中之重要人物、其勢將無人敢加以正視、勞合喬治繼復謂、關於不干涉政策、前此三種協定三均破壞、今此之圖、應以恢復國際間之誠信着想、始可再訂立新約、彼主張監察不必要、各國須謹守中立、任西班牙交戰雙方自行解决其國事、</p>
<p>繼外交次官克蘭波對於直布羅陀附近架設大砲事、加以解釋、稱四戰開姑期中、政府軍軍艦曾聶擊阿爾奇西拉斯、故今日國民軍之架砲或為防止政府軍艦之再來聶擊、且所設之砲、並不精銳、故殊不足畏、外間所傳國民軍在該處架設十二時口徑大砲、亦非事實、蓋英國在直布羅陀之大砲、實較優越惟政府對於此事、應保留其日後相機交涉之權、此種大砲、固可射越海峽、但無軍事上之威脅力二云、</p>
<p>繼艾登復對於監察計劃有所陳述、稱英國提議之計劃係一整個平衡之辦法、倘一部份破壤、則全部崩潰、將來計劃破壤之後、惟一逾徑即為西班牙邊境全部公開、各國共作運輸軍用品人西之競賽、故目前不論其意見如何紛歧、傾向如何不同、但在明日開始監察工作時、應勿望計劃破壞之趨勢云、艾登復稱、地中海為英國最重要之血管、但其中地位甚廣、他圖非不可容、故英國亦毫無獨佔之意、且英國對於英意間地中海協定、迄今遵守不渝、即對於他國亦素無侵略或仇視之意、因英人殊不主張仇讐相根也、英國對於地中海如此、對於紅海亦如此云、</p>
<p>艾登氏總討論國際間經濟問題稱排除貿易之陣礙卽屬排除政治緊張之最有效辦法、英美法三國間之幣制宣言、亦具有此種用意、現英美間商約已在初步商討之中、將來定可裨益於世界之經濟合作、冉則、國際對於原料均配之調查、亦正在進行之中、英國除關稅政策限制之外、願於他方積極合作、以期國際間衝突之經濟原因、得以除云、艾登復謂、國際會尚未死、亦未瀕於死境、其實力雖有限、但於政治方面已有相當之勢力、如法士間爭執之制止、卽可見其梗概也、今日國聯勢力恢復最大之障礙、莫如國家分為西大派、一派站在國際墻裹、一派站在國聯墻外、須知日內瓦地方極大、可容納世界一切國家不論其政治之紛歧、及政體之各異、但求其具有合作維持世界和平之志願、繼稱、德俄政府對於海軍協定之加入、實具有政治家之目光、再則、英法間睦誼之增進、亦無人得加以誤解縱觀一切局勢、尚屬差强人意、彼深知無人需要戰爭、故今日歐洲各國之能和衷共濟、以求消彌意見其希望實較一年以前為佳云（中央社十九日路透電）</p>

<h3>江南劉三</h3>
<p>— 清權</p>
<p>劉三，滬之閔行人，為民黨先進：三十年前，章氏太炎，與高陽張繼，湖南章行嚴，及蜀中鄒容為四友；時鄒年齒最幼，方十九，而著一小冊子，名“革命軍，”自署為“革命軍馬前小卒，”而其文則太炎實促成之，題書面則行嚴之筆，迨蘇報案獄成，而鄒與太炎，乃不得不入獄，未歲，鄒竟瘐斃。</p>
<p>劉三，本字季平，為南社老社友，及其詩文為海內所共傾，知威丹（容字）犧牲國事，而無埋骨之地，捐良田數畝於滬之西郊，以為營葬地，經紀其事者，則為甬人徐鏡吾，恒在四海昇平茶樓下，以賣書為業，不識者咸呼之為“野雞大王，”而不如為提倡革命之眞老前輩也。嗣日月遞嬗，時事亦迭變，鏡吾奄化，而所謂威丹之墟墓，亦遂無知者　劉三豪於飲，而長於吟哦，行三，故自號曰“江南劉三，”昔年見鈍劍“萬樹梅花繞一廬”長卷，題其卷首兩絕云：“豈學騷臣愛悱惻，滋蘭樹蕙紀清華，應傷前度風和兩，三十三天夢落花”，“放翁已死逋僊去，翦紙招回未斷魂，祇恐花時寒徹骨，不辭春酒為君溫。”誦此，可以想見其為人已，乃自昔年膺監委後，惜不易見其丰采焉。</p>
<h3>女網球家何愛英小姐</h3>
<p>— 蔭</p>
<p>每年到了綱球季的時候，我們常在報紙的體育欄裏見到一位旅居海外的女網球家何愛英小姐，參加比賽奪得勝利的消息：國人雖從沒有賞識過她的球藝，但她在海外網球界，却已非常的受人注目。</p>
<p>她今年還不過是一位十六歲的小姑娘。當她十二歲的時候，就在網球界揚了名，奪得幼級女子比賽錦標。此後每年參加英法兩國的各項女子初級比賽，也常常獲得勝利，而博得各圍男女網球家深切的注意，認為她是未來的世界女子網球家。國內的報紙上，也常載着關於她比賽獲勝的電訊。因此，何小姐的芳名，也深印於國人每個注意綱球運動者的腦海裏；一方面也慶幸中國，有這麽一位女網球家蜚聲海外。</p>
<p>在去年她就有參加一年一度的惠勃爾登世界綱球大會的雄心。但英國綱球協會規定不滿十六歲的男女網球員，不得參加惠勃爾登的比賽；假如沒有這種年齡上的限制，那末何小姐的參加惠勃爾登大會是毫無問題的了。因為參加比賽的成年女選手隊裏，有許多人的球藝，並不比她高明，甚至還不及她哩。</p>
<p>今年她已十六歲了，於是她參加惠勃爾登綱球大會的志願，得如願以賞。她是參加今年比賽的九十七位女選手中年齡最小的一人。更以她的身材矮小，望之如十二三歲的人。她第一次出塲所遇到的對手是位英國的女網球家奧康納女士，經過兩盤大戰以後，何小姐以六比八和四比六失敗。看這比數，可知當時兩人競爭是怎樣的劇烈了。何小姐雖然被洶汰，但觀衆及翌日倫敦各報上，對這位小姑娘都表示同情，並熱烈地讚揚她。她最吃虧的地方就是她的身材不够高，另一弱點在於反手抽球。不論如何，她的前途是未可限量，也許在三二年內，在世界網球界中，就佔有重要地位的可能。</p>
<p>但是這次惠勃爾登大會中，她的名字下面却註有“大不列顚”字樣，據英國報紙的解釋，她的父母是中國人，而她呢，却入的大不列顚籍。這裏我們希望我國的體育協進會當局，設法先去解决她的國籍問題。以一位黑頭髮黃臉孔的純粹中國人，代表英國出席綱球塲上，不能不說有點滑稽吧！</p>
<h3>俞鴻鈞夙夜從公</h3>
<p>— 漁江</p>
<p>上海現代市長俞鴻鈞氏，英俊幹練，曾任上海市政府秘書長多年，為歷任市長信任，咸知俞氏之久參市政，經騐甚豐，因引為切身之助。俞氏在未任秘書長之前，曾任市府參軍有年，中間曾一度代長財局，整理市庫，頗具成績，諒滬地人士尚能憶及也。據市政府友好告余，前任張市長吳市長均兼中央執行委員，每日下午四時公畢後，即可離府返家，納凉休息，但俞氏本人，則以職責所在，案牘盈尺，必經親自一一審閱，雖府中職員星散，仍伏案從公，有時且至漏夜，如張吳二前市長之按時從么已難能可貴，而俞代市長之辦事精神，更為難得，故此次中央之命代長市府，誠非偶然也。</p>

<p>五月間浙江省會中等學校舉行第三屆音樂演奏會，敎育廳長許紹棣氏親臨致詞。許氏素擅口才，演講時有條不紊，娓娓動聽。此次會中演講，許氏特舉本人兩次高唱黨歌之功效，證明音樂在敎育方面之意義，尤具趣味。其言云：“須知曾樂在敎育方面具有重大意義，能陶冶性情，煥發精神。今以個人昨今所遇，作事實上之證明：本人連日在吳興參加童軍大會，身體頗感疲憊，昨日返杭，道經莫干山，曾奮勇循一崎嶇小徑上山，初時頗覺困難，乃引吭高唱黨歌一闋，頓覺精神振作，勇氣百倍，終達山巔。又今晨由江干返城，途中見小學生，任意奔馳，呼之不應，乃朗聲唱黨歌，彼輩聞聲羣集，遂訓以新生活守秩序之意義，彼輩均能領悟。音樂之能感人者如此。望勤加訓練，以陶冶個人身心，而發揚民族精神也。”按許氏在浙兼任省黨部委員，故其所言，於黨，於敎育，於新生活三面俱顧，此雖一小事，然措詞亦可謂得體者矣。</p>

<h3>記大力士王子平</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>大凡熟悉國術界情形的人，對於大力士王子平、至少總有相當的印象吧。記得在十餘年以前，俄羅斯某大力士到上海來找人和他比武，風頭出得十足，沒有人敢和他較量；結果，被這位王大力士打敗，替我們大中華民國，了出一口氣，長了一回威風。</p>
<p>更記得有一次、王大力士到日本去，在輪船上，碰到一位日本負有盛名的大力士，要跟王力士比武。那時，正是炎　蒸人的夏天，所以大家身上，只穿着輕薄的衣衫。王力士有意要開開他的頑笑，便眉頭一皺，計上心來的對他說：“我只要用一個小小指頭兒，便可以使你跌倒！……”這樣一說，全船的人，都有些駭然了！大家都圍了櫳來，要看一看兩位大力士的實力，尤其要看看這位中國的大力士怎樣用一個小指頭兒，把這位日本有名的大力士打倒？那知正在這個時候，說得慢，幹得快，只看見這位王大力士、擺動姿勢•立刻走到日本大力士的面前，用小指頭兒上的指甲，在日本大力士的肚臍眼上、胡亂搔動、引得日本大力士忍不住癢處，而笑倒在地了。於是王大力士便當衆對全船的人說：“怎樣？我不是用一個小指頸兒、把他打倒了嗎？如果我用起拳頭來，豈不是要把他摔成肉漿呢？……”這件事情，一時轟動全船，傳為美談，力士雖然用一些小小的聰明，把日本大力士難倒；然而對於我們中華民族，到底是一件有面子的事　現在的王大力士，他已是隱居起來了。除了敎授幾個得意門生的國術技能以外，據說還在小西門那兒，開設一所傷科醫院，專門做些濟世利人的事呢。</p>
<h3>抗戰的話</h3>
<p>— 樂天</p>
<p>西班牙政府軍司令米亞加將軍告前敵將士書中，有幾句壯烈的話，很可以作我們的敎訓，這裏把它轉換口氣，貢獻於全國的同胞：“…諸將士暨民衆乎君等乃自由與獨立之英雄，茲當昭示全世界，使知鄰邦非人道的軍隊，在我境內跳梁者，必被我軍所殲滅，我人誓將侵略者擊敗，使其粉身碎骨，全部滅絕，務使中華民國不成為阿比西尼亞第二，並當俟侵略者敗退之後，建立自由的强大的新中國！”</p>
<h3>記創建首都輪渡之鄭輔華博士</h3>
<p>— 病逸</p>
<p>曩時山滬赴平，既抵下關，必捨車登舟以濟江，犯風霜，震波濤，益以穉老之提掖，行篋之播遷，實旅人所深苦：今則可以安臥車廂，過渡於酣夢中矣。吾人欲知伊誰之賜？即本篇記述之鄭搏士，實自建議以至設計監造一手經營而底於成者也。</p>
<p>國府建都金陵，感平滬通車受阻大江之不便，乃以四萬元之代價，聘請美國橋樑工程之權威華台爾者來華，遍歴京漢杭滬等處，從事實地親察後，對於各綫連絡橋樑，均擬有草案。國內之工程界，率多震其名而從之：惟鄭氏獨抗其說，堅主用輪渡，卒由其手成之，所費僅二百餘萬元，正在建築中之錢塘江鐵橋，估價四千萬元，按此推比，在下關浦口間建橋，必達萬萬元，數十倍於輪渡之造價也。故鄭嘗笑語友人建輪渡所保留建築費之每年年利，即可購一新輪，每年之油漆修理費，可供輪渡之營業費，以國家之貧乏，安可浪費，有此巨款，移築一千公里之鐵道，寗不較優？並謂錢江橋若改用輪渡，亦絕對可以安全通車，潮浪之阻，絕無影響，計擬中之武漢橋，終或改輪渡，蓋巨款難籌，盈利無把握耳。</p>
<p>然鄭氏實吾國橋樑說計之最高領袖，膠濟路之加重全線橋標，津浦北寗各路橋樑之更易，胥出其手。長鐵道部設計科者亦既八年，總綰全國鐵道橋樑之計劃，彼之所以堅主輪渡，實為節國力，寗埋沒長技而不展也。</p>
<p>本年春季，友人作黃山游，晤鄭氏於皖南宣城，蓋渠方任京衢路局事，布衣黑面，一如掌敎於唐山交大之時。友人抵局方十一時許，刺人即延至辦公室，握手敘舊，並介紹一中年工程師某，謂此君止商討一橋樑設計，請小坐：即回身至畫圖桌，繼績探討，繪綫計算，栗碌殊甚，經一時許，尚研談不已，某工程師頻舉目矚客，鄭不之覺，客亦飢腸雷鳴，又不便告退，相持復刻許，事方畢，乃謂友人曰：勞君枯坐，不久即屆午，可共餐暢談。客聞言，忍俊難答，視時表已一時十分，鄭氏乃按鈴傳食，飯罷，客不敢久留，需歸旅舍。翌日至歙縣，工程師某，得鄭君知照，迓於道，蓋亦友人在唐校之高足，談次謂局長學優勤能，人所共知，惜一如昔日作敎援時故，多不近人情之事。即對於操守一端，亦注意過度，偶有所聞，不論虛實，必鬧至滿域風雨，頗令人難堪。言次殊怏怏。友人規之曰：博士老矣，而頑强如昔，時運轉移，奔競圓滿者退，而忠貞樸實者乃能有所為，鄭氏之將來，或能勝詹大佑而過之。對其應世微節，宜加諒。因告以忍飢相候事，乃一笑而轉歡顏焉。</p>
<p>筆者之識鄭氏，尚在十年前，渠方自國外歸，招往茶會，放映美邦橋樑建築程序於銀幕，其手指口講，神往心注之情態，如在目前。聞友人言，拉雜作記，為國人介紹此埋頭笨做尠所閡譽之技人。（稿酬移賑川災）</p>
<h3>固我國本</h3>
<p>— 華民</p>
<p>國家要想盛强，必須國本鞏固。</p>
<p>講求衛生，提倡國貸，這都是鞏固國本的主要條件。</p>
<p>肥皂一項，滌垢去污，要過清潔衛生的生活，不可缺少。</p>
<p>我國製皂事業，最努力的當推五洲固本皂藥廠，出品計有：固本肥皂，固本香皂，固本藥皂，固本皂片，等數種。都能供社會的需要，在國貨中可說是榮譽的貢獻。</p>
<p>我們日常洗滌衣服，沐浴身體，都應一致購用“固本”牌各種肥皂，那不但達到了“講求衛生”“提倡國貨”的目的，並且也能藉此固我國本呀。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>第十六回（消息問城南芸窗說夢風流辭席上綺巷回車）</p>
<p>友梅道：就是昨天晚上的事。國器原是坐着的。這就兩手同時拍着大腿，站了起來，呌了一聲對的。友梅道：你難道看見他出門的嗎？怎麽說是對的？國器笑道：我當然有個證據。但是在我心裏頭，倦管千眞萬確。然而說了出來，却又上分的幼穉。友梅道這話怎麽說，我倒有些不懂。國器望了窗戶外面的樹影。很是沉吟了一會。接着便笑道：這雖然是青天白日，我可說的是夢話。我是昨晚喝醉了回來，作了一晚上的夢。夢裏面最精彩的一段，就是看到你和他一塊兒走着。他兩隻脚全被繩子連銷着，他簡直邁不開步來。所幸你攙住了他一隻手、一步步的扶了他走。友梅交手托住了下巴，連連點頭，哦了兩聲。笑問道：那末，是扶着向什麽地方走呢？國笑道：對了，你是應當有這樣一問的。要不然，這入夢也就沒有什麽價值了。是你扶着他，向一條山路上走。猛然看那山好像是不很高，可是看久了、這山層層向遠推去、推得山尖掩藏在雲霧裏。後來就只看到一個人。隱隱约约在山梁上走，並不是兩個人了。友梅道：只剩一個人了。這個人是誰、你看得清楚嗎？國器聽了他這話且不答言，抬頭向窗子外天空上望着。見屋檐下那顆小樹，將那些零落要擺光的樹葉子，還是搖搖的顫動着。彷彿就像那夢中人在山巔上走路的神氣。便向空中點點頭道：多麽美麗，多麽高尚，又是多麽偉大。友梅聽到他連連贊美了一頓、却不知道贊美的是誰。不過以目前而論，僅僅只有一個女人在這裹，他不是贊美着自己，不贊着誰？這就不由得紅了臉把頭低下去。國器把這個幻想想完了，友梅這才同轉頭來。見友梅坐在斜對面很有些不好意思，這就笑道︰李小姐聽懂了我的話嗎？這才向他看着、鼻子裏哼了一聲，點着頭道：總算我不十分笨。大概表兄說的話，可以領會得到。不過談起讀書這件事，那是不如表兄多多的。表兄說話，要是也像作文章一樣，那我就不懂得。他說到這裹，還微微的一笑。兩行長睫毛簇擁着，烏眼珠在睫毛裏亂轉。接着他又把頭低了下去。國器姑而是沒有理會到他的用意伺在。見他兩腮上泛起了兩塊紅暈，好像有些害臊的樣子，便笑道：我說話會帶有住丈章意味嗎？這個我倒沒有覺到。你說我是那幾句話帶有文章的意味吧（一九九）</p>

<h3>速停談判立即抗戰</h3>

<p>正文:</p>
<p>自從七月八日日軍無故進攻我平西蘆溝橋及宛平，這事件發生到現在，已有十多天了。看最近的情勢，一方面日軍不斷向我軍繼續攻擊，並從關外急速輸入大批增援軍隊，有大規模作攻擊戰的形勢，而另一方面，却又有什麼和平談判，在天津等地舉行。我們眞十分的懷疑，此刻在北方進行中的所謂“和平談判”，究覓是一些什麼內容呢？</p>
<p>我們要在這里確定的指出：在日本帝國主義砲火壓迫之下，連最低限度的和平談判，也絕無成立的可能的，除是中國方面多少給予敵人以讓步！中央當局，對於華北談判，一再聲明這不是地方事件，如有約定，應由中央認可始生效力；一方面，華北與日方進行和平談判的諸人物，也聲明决在不喪權辱國條件下請和平。其實，這一些聲明，並不是以保障蘆溝橋事件之結果，不來一個類如“何梅協定的東西。因為我們從過去給我們的敎訓，知道每一次和敵人談判，結果無不是以屈辱為代價的。更說這次談判能不接受任何辱國條件，我敢預先指出：這是絕對不可的事！</p>
<p>因此，我們主張：目下在進行中的談判，應速停止，若為顧全大局起見：還須談判的話，我們對敵人只有一句話迅速將軍隊撤退——此外更無商量餘地。因為我們永遠不忘記偉大領袖蔣委員長這麼一句話：“如敵人再來侵犯我國一寸土地，這便是我們犧牲已到最後關頭”了！現在日軍在平西一帶自由橫行，所侵略的已不止一寸土地，而是數寸方里之大了！然則，此時正是已到“最後犧牲關頭”，更無疑義。因為我們唯一的要求；是立卽抗戰！汪精衛先生說過：我們是“抗日”不是“排日”，那末，這里我們要高呼：全國一致起來抗日！這是全民抗敵的時候了！</p>
<p>我們敬向政府堅决的要求：速令華北一切和平談判終止，因為這無論如何是辱國無疑的；立調大軍北上，喻知人民，愛國無罪，允許一切救國團體之存在。</p>
<p>其次，我們民衆要立卽自動去做的：募捐慰勞，組織抗敵民衆團體，擁護政府對外强硬的國策，抵制仇貨等。</p>
<p>時機危急，千鈞一髪，蘆橋事件，很可能接着是整個華北的淪亡！要保衛華北，為是華民族求一綫生存之路，則抗敵救亡，此時已到最後關頭！我們熱成擁護政府，領導四萬五千萬熱血沸騰的民衆，興敵人作誓死的週旋！</p>
<h3>“七·八”在北平</h3>
<p>— 芷夫</p>
<p>一位南歸客的談話</p>
<p>雖然，已經下了一塲大雨：雖然，天空起了微凉的晚風，呌人覺得爽快了好多，但這一個小小的房間內，擠足了我們四個人，因此裏邊的熱度仍似乎一點也沒有減低。</p>
<p>我揮着扇，額上的汗珠還不住的往顋邊淌下來。可是那位南歸的客人的談話，並不因天熱而低瘖了他的喉嚨。他激昂地說着，有幾次我也幾乎跟他一樣地舉起了我的臂膊。我是太給感動了。</p>
<p>然而我每次又鎮定了下來。為了再聽他談話的下文，二位朋友也悄靜地不發一聲咳響，終於他又說下去了：—</p>
<p>“朋友！自從××人奪了我們的滿洲去，北平和天津二個地方，不但也成了他們理想的領域，就是整個華北，他們也早有預謀權奪的野心了！……過去，不是他們在豐台幾次為了一點兒小事，曾藉口和我們的駐軍挑釁嗎？但幾次沒有演成這幕戲劇，他們是大失所望了。……然而他們眞的失望吧，朋友？……不，他們决不肯輕易放棄了侵略的野心的。……因此，朋友！我們也早就料到平津的事變是絕斷不能避免的啊……</p>
<p>“……朋友！但在現時候中，只要不是漢奸，是每個不願做亡國奴的人們，誰甘願再讓××人進來是兇呢，你想</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，……尤其是我們忠勇的廿九軍將士，就在七•八那晚上×乓來進擾的時候，舉起了槍桿朝向我們最大的仇敵衝殺上去了。………</p>
<p>“可是，朋友！……當蘆溝橋響起了砲聲的那晚，可憐北平城內的居民，全夥兒把心兒吊了起來！然而朋友！——我們為了要加强後方民衆抗×的决心，在閉了城門的北平的腹地裏，我們便開始作我們應作的事情了！………</p>
<p>“朋友！我們現在的出路惟有上火綫抗戰，朋友！我們要喊出‘予打擊者以打擊’的口號！………在街頭，在巷尾，我們是和親愛的老百姓這樣交談了。——而民衆都樂於聽受我們的說話。…</p>
<p>“有幾次我們簡直快樂極了：</p>
<p>“朋友！我告訴你︰我們出發的第一天，是在西直門一條有名的胡向內。但這裏現在可顯得很冷寂！我們利用銅鈴的力量集攏了上十個附近的居民：接着我們開始報告了平郊的戰况，和後方民衆應有的幾種認識………他們被激動了！我眼看見人羣中有人擦摩着手拳，並且喊出：“打死××人”，“我們要和平津共生存，共死亡！”……的口號。朋友！我們的民衆畢竟沒有麻木啊！</p>
<p>“接着，同行的宣傳員們開始唱着悲壯的救亡歌曲：——</p>
<p>“起來不願做奴隸的人們！把我們的血肉……………’”</p>
<p>“粗大的嗓子細響的嗓子…………組合成一個有力的合唱，把整條胡同的空氣，塗上了一種嚴肅和緊張………朋友！這些人誰甘願做亡國的奴隸呢？……</p>
<p>“然而這歌聲，驚動了街頭的巡警。——警士來了。他高聲地阻止我們道</p>
<p>“‘不許你們這樣胡鬧！’”</p>
<p>“‘我們愛國，難道不許我們嗎？’”</p>
<p>“‘不許你們高唱’”</p>
<p>“‘我們偏要唱，壓迫愛國者也就是漢奸！’”</p>
<p>“‘漢奸替我們滾開去………’”</p>
<p>“‘………’”那位警士最後紅了臉，却悄悄地退了出去了。</p>
<p>“朋友！我們眞樂極了！——不比去年的事，他們會拿了水龍，木棍來催殘我們，你想，那位警士現在也原諒着我們的熱忱，我們太感激他了！</p>
<p>“然而，我的朋友啊！我自從給自己的環攪逼回了南方後，平郊的事伴到現在還相持着。我相信，這座古老喧囂的北平城，不久一定會爆出了鮮明的火花，讓我們這羣不願做亡國奴的靑年人！……</p>
<h3>螞蟻的勝利</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>晚餐過後，大家坐在院子里乘涼，這是夏天最舒快的時候了。日間餘剩下來的瓜菓，再慢慢地剖着吃，所謂浮瓜沉李，自有一種樂趣。花牆上爬着牽牛花，開着一朶二朶白色的小花。不知有什麼東西飛過，倦伏在脚邊的小花貓突然用襲擊的恣態向花墻上蹿去，可是一無所獲，失望地回來，用前腿洗着臉。晶瑩的月亮已經升在屋角之上了。</p>
<p>最小的孩子蹲在花墻脚下，似乎在傾聽什麼。他是最喜歡蟋蟀的，或許又在那里發掘寶藏吧。哥哥似乎也發現這祕密了，輕輕地潛到背後掩住他的眼睛。這出其不意的突擊使他驚呌了起來，但是他馬上知道這是哥哥的惡作劇，沒有扯去哥哥的手掌，就喊着：</p>
<p>“哥哥，你看啊。”</p>
<p>花牆脚下正開展着一個戰鬥塲面，一個螳螂被一羣螞蟻圍攻着。螳螂顯得很威勇的樣子在揮動它的雙刀，螞蟻就像一個小皮球那樣滾東滾西，但是有幾個却死命咬着它的翅膀，使它不能迅速地殺出重圍，而螞蟻愈聚愈多了。</p>
<p>天色已經很昏暗了，月光被牽牛花茂盛的枝葉擋住了，偶然在風吹過搖動的時候，篩下移動的圓光，那個蒼翠色的螳螂被圍在一羣蠕動的小動物中，眞是一幅美麗的圖畫。</p>
<p>哥哥也耐心地等着看了。他們漸漸蹲得更近一點，像一個科學家在化騐室里檢騐他們的新發明。弟弟更用一根細小的草莖，為螞蟻做從巢穴直達前線的領導，一面阻止螳螂的殺敵。看着它的雙刀漸漸不能揮動了，而身上的螞蟻却愈來愈多，彷彿一個不會泳水的鷄子跌到小河里一樣，聲嘶力竭地掙扎着而終於不能轉動了。</p>
<p>蟻螞自然佔到最後的勝利了。哥兒倆個高興地歡呼起來，因為他們感到一種精神上的喜悅。等到大家圍到花墻脚下去看時，借着月光，紙見一個黑色的小山沿着牆根在慢慢移動。</p>
<p>“這羣螞蟻或許在唱着凱旋之歌吧？”我想。</p>
<p>回到屋子來，兄弟倆在燈下溫書的時候，我問他們，那樣弱小的螞蟻能戰勝一個螳螂，是什麼緣故。</p>
<p>“那是團結的力量！”他們一同回答。</p>
<p>“惟團結才能生存！”蟻螞與螳螂之戰果然是一個很舊式的寓言了，但是每一個寓言都能給我們一個很好的敎訓的。</p>
<h3>苦雨行</h3>
<p>— 長吉</p>
<p>一行人連脚夫共是十五個，冒着雨仍舊向安康縣出發。五雙穿草鞋的鴨板脚，走起路來是那樣吱啊沙的！濺得滿身都是泥水。尤其是脚夫們的肩上都壓着一担重量的行李，落脚時就比空手的客人要重得多，泥水也飛濺得格外高。這時大家都把肚皮填得很飽的，走起來都有一股臭勁，不像昨天落店時那樣疲備不中用了。不過大家都同口一聲的憎咒着這捉狹鬼的天，一連幾天，瀟瀟的霪雨一直就沒有停過。已是傾頹的羊腸山徑，現在更是滑溜的不好走了。大家都小心的踏穩脚步，轉灣抹角的一程又一程的挨走着。</p>
<p>最使這一行人感到艱苦的，那就是要算過一道溝又一道溝的時候了。從山上直衝下來的一股洪水，是那樣急趨的從每個人的脚丫裏流過去，無形中就阻碍了前進的速度，如果踹着石子上的靑苔，一定能夠把人死在溝子裏。大家的臉上和頭髮上都是像剛從水裏浸過的，濕淋淋的也分不淸是汗，還是被打着的雨水。</p>
<p>“怎麼這麼多的溝子呢？還有多少天纔能走得到啊！”客人中的一個，似乎走不慣這樣的險路，他獨自喃喃的抱怨着。</p>
<p>“老板，一大半的路走完了。假使現在馬上就晴起來，那麼我們再走兩天，就好到安康縣了。”</p>
<p>一個年記很大背脊帶點駝的脚頭，露着他一口沒剩多少的黃板牙，這樣很有經騐的安慰着剛纔那個怨艾的客人。</p>
<p>“馬大哥，這次眞辛苦你們了。偏逢天氣不好，揀這樣黃梅天上路；不說你們挑了這樣重的東西不好走路，就是我們空手走的也實在走得累乏了。”</p>
<p>“祗要路上無事，平平安安的趕到了。老板，我們就是再辛苦一點，也是很高興的啊！”</p>
<p>“惟願這樣好，我們今天早一點打尖吧！”</p>
<p>“不能，我們今天一定要趕過山道子溝纔能打尖，那是一條險夷的溝子啊！恐怕這樣大的水，連渡船都要不敢撐了。我們早一點趕過去設法吧！”</p>
<p>大家都覺得馬大哥的話很對，就鼓起精神來趕路，等到他們一行趕到山道子溝的時候，天色更是陰沉下來，溝子裏流着滔滔的瀑布，把水花怒濺到岸上來。這時喊破了喉嚨也不見有一隻渡船的踪影，大家心裏不由都一齊焦急了。</p>
<p>“這怎樣辦？馬大哥”！</p>
<p>“我們不能待在這裏過夜啊？馬大哥！”</p>
<p>大家都把這些話來問那個年老多經騐的馬大哥，逼得他苦喪着臉啼笑不得</p>
<p>“你們不要慌啊！原說這樣大水要連渡船都不敢撐了，現在等我去找找看吧！”</p>
<p>他盤了多少溝子纔覓到一隻小柴船，那隻船也是因為不敢冒險纔藏在這僻靜地方的，經不住馬大哥苦苦的商量，纔答應渡他們過溝子去，這纔使馬大哥笑逐顏開，大聲喊着：</p>
<p>“船有了，大家快來上船吧！”</p>
<p>十幾個人都急急的搶上了船，可是這隻很小的船身就沉重的有些吃不住，一陣劇烈震盪之後船家纔鼓着靑筋，把竹篙一點，就離開堤岸向那狂瀾中冒衝過去；大家都懷着一個危慄的念頭緊繫在這飄荒烟雨中。</p>

<h3>答不會白相先生書</h3>
<p>— 老白相</p>
<p>前日我老興勃發，和一位友人開開玩笑，寫了一篇亂話的信，詎知還沒有接到友人的復書，乃橫垜裏閃出了一位程咬金，熊腰虎背，一眼像銅鈴，手執丈八蛇矛，也來參加作戰，我不免大吃一驚，後來定睛一看，原來也是一位十餘年的老友，方繼放下心來。</p>
<p>說起老白相三字，十分慚愧，我生平本來不會白相，白相而老，更不敢當，但是我現在有相富的年齡，話大不大，話小不小，所以對於處世的藝術，若然不客氣的話，果然有相當的研究，從前我脾氣很壞，不論什麼人，我總要和他搗蛋，無論什麼事，我總要別出一調去幹，現在年紀漸漸大了，碰壁的事，也經騐得豐富了，於是乎知道在世界之上，此路完全不通，若談處世藝術，簡直更是大拖其倒車。</p>
<p>於是乎我尋到一位老先生，這位老先生，諸位知道他姓甚名誰？提起了眞是此馬來頭大，姓李名聃，據說還是我們的太先生，是我們先聖先師扎老夫子的老師，他的處世藝術，十分高明，他處世藝術的要訣，便是“和其光同其塵”六字，我研究這兩名學說，差不多有三四十年之久，方才敢出而問世，所以我現在的脾氣變了，是大變了，是胡調主義者。</p>
<p>我變的方法是怎樣？老白相的得名，便在此處，古人有冒籍聖賢，我何敢冒籍白相，聖賢可以冒充，而老白相决不能冒充，假定冒充，必定要露出馬脚，但是我數十年研究了和光同塵的本領，就在此處一顯身手，和光同塵四字的意義，照現在社會學的術語來詮釋，便是“胡調”二字，因為胡調，而老白相的頭銜，便被人像英王加冕似的高高地加上來了。</p>
<p>但是我的胃口眞佳，决不動氣，亦决心拒絕，人呼我為馬，我便應之曰馬，人呼我為牛，我便應之曰牛，人呼我老白相，天然也是謹敬地接受，其實眞是冤枉孽障，我本來要想請位大名鼎鼎的律師，照刑律第一萬九千九百九十九條邅改大名之罪，向海牙國際法庭去控訴，後來囊中摸摸，“畢的生司”，此念因而打消，並且若一經起訴，不免將數十年鍜鍊成功的胡調秘訣，敗於一朝，亦屬可惜，因此訴訟的念頭，逃竄到瓜注國去了，便毫不客氣地也自認為老白相，其實我的綽號，還有許多，老狐貍，老猾頭，均是我的大號，不過其他渾名，不及老白相二字榮譽罷了。</p>
<p>但是這位不會白相的朋友，我知道他眞是一位貨眞價實，不折不扣的老白相，狗也要白相，鳥也要白相，金鯽魚也要白相，花草樹木更是他的專門名家，也要白相，不會白相的朋友，偏偏來得會白相，而著名的老白相，偏偏不會白相，世界上不公不平的事，沒有更過於此、天下底浪得虛名，而亳無實際的本領，於此可見一斑，世界上所以不易太平，也便在於此處。</p>
<p>不會白相的朋友，我知道他十分富於情感，他自不幸的遭遇了“小”故之後，橫也小故，豎也小故，坐定也看見小故，走路也看見小故，房間裏看見小故，花園裏也看到小故，覩物增懷，更無時無地不念念有詞地念着小故，現在看見蘆溝橋事件，又怒髪衝帽子，欲隨機關槍大砲之後，殺向蘆溝橋去，與敵人拼個你死我活，即使與殉國壯士長眠一起，倒也嘸啥，何其壯也，何其烈也，可知富於情感的人，便何往而不情感作用，一往情深，所以他在一把鼻涕一把眼淚之中，還要拖老白相一同至蘆溝橋去白相白相，這種愛國熱忱，眞是欽佩到十體投地。</p>
<p>但是我近年以來，消極的念頭，已到了冰點以下二千八百度，非但對於世事不去聞問，即對於家庭個人的事，也不去聞問，我鄕家中的房屋，年久失修，大門尤其是破壞，因此被野狗一淘一淘地侵了進來，我絕對不想和野狗抵抗，也不想和野狗為難，我消極的念頭，總算達極點了，家中的事，尚且不放在腦裏邊，而况遠在數千里外的蘆溝橋，干我甚事，但是現在聽見了不會白相的朋友一番的議論，不由我不死灰復燃，熱了起來，更熱到了白熱度之上還要加上一倍的熱，情愿和不會白的朋友到蘆溝橋去，嘗嘗槍林彈雨的滋味，請大家也一齊起來罷。</p>
<p>我從前所讀的書，早已原封不動的一齊奉還了先生，尤其是詩詞歌曲，始終沒有領敎過，不會白相的朋友，搬出了許多硬性的詩，軟性的詞，來和我開玩笑，簡直對牛彈琴，眉眼做給了瞎眼看，一樣底無效，我只知道俗語的一句話，情願和蘇州人相罵，不情願和寗波人由話，因為蘇州人的口調，十分柔軟，莫說和他們白話，聽了十分開心，便是和他們相罵，也很有味兒，不會白相久居蘇州，我知道他一定會軟得一場糊塗，豈知有時硬起來，比寗波人還硬，眞是出於肚皮之外，近日天熱得蠟痢頭鬼火冒，我沒有精神神再寫下去，請大家來少吃一些東西，多吃一些鹹菜，草草奉復，願頌儷安，老白相寫於七馬路理想里亭子間的大閣樓中。</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Japanese Embassy Counselor Hidaka visited Minister Wang at his official residence at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 8 a.m. on the 20th to continue exchanging opinions regarding the Lugouqiao Incident. Foreign Minister Wang told him that the current situation was urgent, and there was no need for either side to engage in fruitless debates that would delay the overall situation. Both sides must take swift action to avoid escalating the situation. If it is said that there are objectionable aspects to the troop movements of the Chinese army in Hebei Province, then the presence of a large number of Japanese troops in the province is even more obviously an infringement on China's territorial sovereignty. Minister Wang then reiterated the proposals in yesterday's aide-mémoire, saying that both sides should immediately agree on a date to simultaneously cease military actions and withdraw troops, as this is the only possible way to avoid conflict. Mr. Wang also stated that since both sides have said that they do not want to escalate the situation and that the dispatch of troops is merely a precaution, there is no reason not to accept China's proposal. Regarding the matter of local negotiations, Minister Wang stated that diplomacy in any country is handled by the central government. As far as this incident is concerned, the Chinese government is always prepared to negotiate with the Japanese government to seek a swift and fair resolution. If there are local matters that can be resolved locally, it must also be with the permission of the Chinese central government. Finally, Minister Wang also stated that the Chinese government has repeatedly expressed its strong desire to achieve a peaceful resolution of this unfortunate incident. As long as there is a glimmer of hope for peace, China will never abandon its efforts to pursue a peaceful resolution through diplomatic channels. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Repel Attackers With Attack</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek publicly delivered his speech the day before yesterday, our country's attitude towards the Japanese military's provocation has been firmly expressed. Since the 29th Army fought bravely at Lugouqiao and Fengtai yesterday, our country's defense and resistance have made factual progress. Before this, frontline contact was always uncertain, with wavering on whether to fight or make peace. But today, the curtain has been raised, and there is no turning back. Our country has united 450 million people as one, with one heart, to fight those who invade and plunder us, and determine the outcome on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Our country has 5,000 years of culture. All civilized and progressive people love peace, respect etiquette and justice, and do not advocate war. They know that war can destroy civilization, and it should not be used lightly unless absolutely necessary. The world is becoming increasingly progressive, and international organizations are establishing mechanisms and drafting conventions to eliminate war. Civilized countries, even with conflicts of interest, are reluctant to start wars. But ambitious people take advantage of people's desire for peace to satisfy their desire for expansion. For example, Japan towards our country. Since the September 18th Incident, from the three northeastern provinces to Rehe, and then to further encroach on our Beiping and Tianjin. We encourage ourselves with peace, but they brutally add military force. We used reason to negotiate, but they oppressed us with military power. They turned a blind eye to conventions and rejected all mediation, to the extreme of their ambition. They want to destroy our history and occupy our territory, making attacks their ability and invasion their routine. This makes it necessary for us today to repel attackers with attack, and embark on the path of resistance to preserve the fate of our nation. We are right and strong, and there is no need for divination. And the suffering of the Japanese people is all due to the poison of their ambitious people. No one who acts alone and violently can survive. So the attack on people will also be struck, and this is predictable.</p>
<p>Looking back at the situation in North China, since the fall of Rehe, violence has been directed at Beiping and Tianjin for five years. At that time, we still encouraged ourselves with peace, and there was the Tanggu Truce, hoping to realize the initial intention of internal self-preservation and external coexistence. But the Japanese took an inch and wanted to place Beiping and Tianjin under their noses. Fortunately, Song Zheyuan of the Hebei-Chahar authorities firmly laid the foundation for the overall situation at the time of crisis. The brave soldiers of our 29th Army who supported were being stimulated by the battles of Xifengkou and Lengkou. The scars everywhere left memories of vowing to repay the country with death. They were stationed in Beiping and Tianjin to continue their duty of defending the territory and protecting the country. Judging from their state of mind, no matter when or where, as long as they can express their loyalty for the nation and justice, who would be willing to be a step behind in wielding their knives and mounting their horses? But unfortunately, there was another scene of the retreat from Fengtai. We seek to preserve the whole by compromising, while others oppress us unreasonably. We had to let soldiers change defenses in tears. As for today, what is contained is getting deeper and deeper, and what is expressed is becoming stronger and stronger. Wanping, a solitary city in the wilderness, resolutely resisted and fought, enough to see the early signs of a sure victory.</p>
<p>As for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's position on the country, he has repeatedly emphasized it, and everyone understands it. In recent years, he has especially focused on external troubles and devoted himself to all military and political construction. All parties in the country have recognized his loyalty and moved towards unification. Chairman Chiang himself is even more able to actively lead and handle things with ease. The declaration is clear and profound, explaining the country's position and the minimum bottom line. The life of the entire nation. His leadership of the whole country, encouragement of the people, and even declaration to Japan, all come from deep sincerity. He is resolute and encourages the weak. I dare to believe that the officers and soldiers of our loyal and brave national army, and even the people of the whole country, will be able to "resolve to sacrifice everything" and never "give up an inch of land and sovereignty" to avoid falling into "the eternal sinners of the Chinese nation." This can be asserted.</p>
<h3>Two American Women Kicked by Japanese Soldiers in Beiping</h3>

Ms. Rathrop also said, "The soldiers were noisy at the time and pushed us both very rudely."

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek's Declaration Unanimously Praised by International Public Opinion</h3>
<p>British newspaper believes the wording is firm and tactful; German newspaper says we have the determination to clarify the situation</p>
<p>[London] British newspapers have recently continued to comment on the Far East situation. The News Chronicle reported that the responsibility for maintaining peace should be borne by Japan. General Chiang Kai-shek's declaration yesterday was firm and tactful, expressing a willingness to maintain peace on the one hand, and proposing practical suggestions on the other, which can be described as prudent and thoughtful. What the world should know is that he possesses a China with 400 million people, which cannot be easily destroyed. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that "Neither Nanjing nor Tokyo intends to start a major war. It is hoped that diplomats from both China and Japan can find a solution that is acceptable to both parties." The Morning Post reported that "Japan may be able to defeat China, but cannot conquer it. China may be able to resist Japan, but it will be greatly injured." (Havas, 20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] The Manchester Guardian commented on the Far East situation today, saying that the terms of the Treaty of Versailles in the Far East rarely have an expiration date, because the Far East understands the art of bargaining far better than the West. Therefore, the Nanjing government's rejection of Japan's demands does not necessarily mean the end of negotiations. There is no doubt that the current situation is critical, but it is worth noting that Chairman Chiang's statement clearly recognizes the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and insists only that any solution must not hinder China's land and sovereignty. Nanjing has not taken any action that can be condemned as aggression. This can be clearly stated. Even if a secret agreement existed that China was not allowed to move its own troops in its own province, this agreement should have been cancelled by the arrival of Japanese troops in the province. (Reuters, 20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding Prime Minister Eden's statement in the House of Commons the other day that he intended to assist China and Japan in resolving their disputes, the London Morning Post stated that an Anglo-Japanese agreement is being discussed. After it is established in the future, the friendship between Britain and Japan will be strengthened, and Britain and Japan can cooperate peacefully with China to start the world's largest market. But peace is the only condition. Without peace, the Far East will not progress for decades. (Reuters, 20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Berlin] German newspapers commented on the Sino-Japanese situation, believing that the Chinese government has the determination to clarify the situation. This determination is due to the following reasons: ㊀ China's increasing national strength, ㊁ Japan's domestic and foreign difficulties, ㊂ the attitudes of countries such as Britain and the United States. It also said that European countries attach importance to disputes related to their own countries and pay little attention to China's administrative reforms and defense progress. (National Seaborne Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>[Paris] French newspapers have recently continued to comment on the Far East situation. The right-wing Figaro reported that "If the Japanese General Staff did not have the confidence to end the war with China quickly, and if their spy agencies were not sure that Soviet Russia would not take the opportunity to attack Manchuria, they would not send a large number of troops to China." The communist L'Humanité reported that "The fascist countries originally hoped that Britain would be an accomplice in the Spanish issue, and they think the same about the China issue. Although the United States' attitude towards peace disruptors is becoming increasingly firm, it is not what they want." (Havas, 20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Discusses Japanese Conspiracy</h3>
<p>Aiming to Encroach on China</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting said today that Japan harbors a grand conspiracy to invade China. Their methods start with creating incidents, and then slowly seek local solutions to achieve their encroachment policy. I sincerely hope that Japan will not make the situation more serious, otherwise it will only plunge the Far East continent into great chaos, and the result will disturb world peace. The Chinese government has reiterated to Japan its willingness to withdraw troops simultaneously and peacefully resolve the Lugouqiao Incident. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>US Treasury Secretary Considers Sino-Japanese Issue</h3>
<p>Whether it will affect the monetary agreement</p>
<p>[Washington] Treasury Secretary Ghen Kindler stated today that he may ask Attorney General Cummings whether the recently signed Sino-US monetary agreement will be affected if the United States implements the Neutrality Act due to the crisis between China and Japan. Some authorities have expressed the opinion that although the law stipulates that all credit loans to belligerent countries are prohibited, only private loans are prohibited.

<h3>The World's Wartime Military Expenditure (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zang Yi</p>
<p>The table prepared by Haas is based on materials such as the League of Nations Military Yearbook. From this, we can see the increase in military spending by various countries during the five years from 1932 to 1936. It is now transcribed as follows: (Unit: Million Yuan)</p>
<p>Note: A includes Abyssinian war expenses; B The sum of the three numbers above does not match.</p>
<p>In the current situation, as a result of the establishment of a £1.5 billion national defense plan, Britain's military expenditure this year is four times that of before the war. France has established a four-year national defense plan with a total amount of 19 billion francs (approximately 3.2 billion in national currency), and its military expenditure this year is also several times higher than before the war. The speed at which Germany, Italy, Japan, the Soviet Union, and the United States are expanding their armaments is, of course, equally alarming. As for the smaller countries, this year the Netherlands has increased its national defense expenditure by 80 million yuan in special expenses. Poland borrowed a huge debt of 400 million yuan from France to cover its domestic military expenditure. Czechoslovakia issued 400 million yuan in national defense public bonds. Other countries such as Belgium, Switzerland, and Turkey are also committed to national defense and vigorously developing armaments.</p>
<p>As a result of the expansion of armaments by various countries, private enterprises are experiencing difficulties in obtaining capital, raw materials, and skilled workers, which affects the commodity market. As a result, prices are soaring, and the living standards of the people are being forced to decline. On the other hand, in order to raise military expenditure, governments have to borrow money to supplement the shortage of legitimate financial resources, which leads to severe credit expansion and makes the social economy even more insecure. In short, the unlimited expansion of armaments by various countries has the potential to trigger a world war. Even if we disregard this possibility, the direct impact alone is enough to make us feel apprehensive.</p>

<h3>700,000 Soviet Party Members Expelled</h3>
<p>Accounting for a Quarter of the Total Communist Party Membership; Expressing Extreme Sympathy for China's Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>[London] According to recent news from Moscow, the Soviet Union is closely watching China's resistance against Japan with extreme sympathy. Soviet sources say that China should not expect anything more than moral support from the Soviet Union. The Soviet administrative organs and the Communist Party are still continuing their purge work, determined to eliminate all reactionary elements. To date, a quarter of the total Communist Party membership, approximately 700,000 people, have either been expelled from the party, arrested, or executed by the party without the slightest leniency. In addition, the Soviet government had previously decided to establish military soviets in various military districts to strengthen political management. Later, many military leaders, fearing that their personal authority and military discipline would be hindered, immediately raised objections, resulting in disputes and widespread elimination. Regarding foreign affairs, the former Chief of the General Staff of the Army, Tukhachevsky, and several senior generals reportedly proposed that if the Soviet Union was not prepared to go to war with Germany, it should approach Germany so that it could have freedom of action in the Far East without worrying about the rear. This was because Stalin, the Soviet dictator, believed that war was not necessarily inevitable, at least not for a considerable period of time. (Havas Dispatch, 20th, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Sino-Japanese Problem</h3>
<p>Both War and Peace Are Possible; Britain Continues to Liaise with the United States and France; Willing to Mediate If Needed</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons discussed the government's foreign policy today. Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a lengthy speech explaining the international situation. Many foreign envoys to Britain attended, including the ambassadors of China, the United States, Belgium, and Poland, the ministers of Switzerland and Czechoslovakia, and officials from the Japanese Embassy. Eden's speech first addressed the Far East issue, stating that the situation in the Far East is still uncertain. The British government has expressed its hope to the Chinese and Japanese governments that the dispute will be resolved peacefully. The British government is maintaining close contact with the governments of the United States and France, whose opinions are the same as Britain's, and who are extremely concerned about the dispute and hope for a peaceful resolution. However, a peaceful solution is most likely to succeed through direct consultations between China and Japan. As for third countries, in addition to expressing their natural concern for maintaining peace, they should not intervene. "We have informed the Chinese and Japanese authorities that any other government that can assist in resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute will be happy to do its part within its capabilities." He then said, "If the unstable situation in North China continues to exist and incidents continue to occur, and if these are dealt with reluctantly through local solutions, and the effectiveness and scope of these solutions are highly questionable, then the situation will remain fraught with danger." (Havas Dispatch, 20th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne concluded the debate by saying that as far as the British government knows, both the Chinese and Japanese governments do not want to resort to terrible war. There is now a very great danger that the two countries will be drawn into the vortex of war, but the British government still sincerely hopes that a peaceful solution is still possible. If the British government needs to help in any solution, the British government is always willing to contribute. The British government wants to act jointly with the United States and has already contacted the United States and intends to continue to contact it in the future. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons met today, and Foreign Secretary Eden, in reply to a question from opposition leader Attlee regarding the situation in China, said that the British government is currently in close contact with all relevant governments step by step. There is little news in addition to what he told the House of Commons yesterday. He has not yet received information on the Chinese government's response to the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires' note of July 17th. As for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's declaration, he has received news in the consulate. Attlee also asked whether it was true that Japanese troops bombed a certain town, presumably Wanping, as reported in the newspapers. The Foreign Secretary replied that he had not yet received any information. (Reuters Dispatch, 20th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Eden Announces International Policy</h3>
<p>Absolutely No Participation in Ideological Blocs; Anglo-French Cooperation is Key to European Peace</p>
<p>[London] In the second part of his speech, British Foreign Secretary Eden addressed the Spanish question, expressing satisfaction that the Adjustment Committee had accepted the British compromise proposal as a basis for discussion. He stated, "This compromise proposal must be made to succeed; otherwise, foreign powers will intensify their interference in the Spanish Civil War, and the future of Europe will inevitably face immense danger. This danger existed last autumn, but fortunately, former French Prime Minister Blum proposed the Non-Intervention Agreement, and the danger was thus avoided." Eden then spoke about the Mediterranean issue, saying, "Britain is determined to defend its interests in the Mediterranean, just as it does its interests everywhere else, but does not intend to exclude any other country from the Mediterranean. In short, we will always adhere to the Anglo-Italian Gentleman's Agreement regarding the Mediterranean." He then discussed the ongoing trade negotiations between Britain and the United States, saying that both countries believe such a trade agreement would greatly benefit the development of international trade. Regarding the League of Nations, he said that the League has neither died nor is it on its last legs. He then solemnly declared that Britain has decided never to participate in any ideological bloc, neither the anti-communist bloc nor the anti-fascist bloc. He praised the recent signing of naval treaties between the Soviet Union and Germany with Britain separately, saying that the cooperation between Russia and Germany can be evidenced by this. Finally, Eden elaborated on the friendly relations between Britain and France, stating that since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War twelve months ago, Europe has safely passed through without any terrible conflict, which is mainly due to the friendship between Britain and France. In conclusion, he said, "The Spanish Civil War has created a major crisis in Europe, but after twelve months, it has not led to major changes. Even if various countries express fervent sympathy for any party involved in the Spanish Civil War, they are unwilling to expand the Spanish Civil War beyond Spain. It can be seen that the future of Europe is quite optimistic. A year ago, I hoped that all disputes could be resolved and peace could be preserved. Today, I still hold this hope, and it is even stronger than before."</p>
<p>After Foreign Secretary Eden finished his speech, opposition Labour Party member Dalton, an expert on foreign affairs for the party, spoke first. He mentioned the situation in the Far East, saying that he hopes Britain will work with the United States to maintain peace in the Far East. Regarding the Spanish question, he said that from Britain's point of view, it would be advantageous to limit the Spanish Nationalist forces from becoming too powerful. As for the Mediterranean, if Germany and Italy were to intervene, the lines of communication between Britain, France, and their colonies would be directly threatened. (Central News Agency, Havana, 18th)</p>
<p>[London] Churchill then stated that the Spanish Nationalist forces have erected large cannons around and near Gibraltar, which are not necessary for the Spanish Civil War. If Nationalist leader Franco intends to control Gibraltar and the Strait, Britain cannot ignore it. Lloyd George also stated that the power of these cannons is sufficient to blockade the Strait, and that the intention of one of the fascist countries close to Franco is very clear, which is to control the Mediterranean. The reason why these fascist countries sent troops to Spain is also because Spain can control the Mediterranean. If the Suez Canal is once blockaded by others, the only other route would be around the Cape of Good Hope, but if Spain is used as a base for submarines and air forces by an enemy country, that route will also be threatened. Lloyd George continued, Portugal is now closely colluding with Franco, which can be seen from the fact that it is closer to the Balearic Islands being controlled by fascists. If Franco achieves victory in Spain with the help of Italian volunteer soldiers and German experts and cannons, he will become an important figure in the German-Italian alliance, and no one will dare to confront him. Lloyd George further stated that regarding the non-intervention policy, the previous three agreements have all been broken. The current plan should aim to restore international credibility before a new agreement can be made. He advocated that surveillance is unnecessary, and all countries must adhere to neutrality, allowing the warring parties in Spain to resolve their own national affairs.</p>
<p>Next, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne explained the erection of cannons near Gibraltar, saying that during the early stages of the war, government warships had attacked Algeciras, so the Nationalist forces' erection of cannons today may be to prevent government warships from attacking again. Moreover, the cannons are not sophisticated, so there is nothing to fear. The external reports that the Nationalist forces erected 12-inch caliber cannons there are also not true, as Britain's cannons in Gibraltar are superior. However, the government should reserve the right to negotiate on this matter in the future. These cannons can indeed fire across the Strait, but there is no military threat.</p>
<p>Eden then presented some information on the surveillance plan, saying that the plan proposed by Britain is a balanced approach as a whole. If one part is destroyed, the whole will collapse. After the plan is destroyed, the only path is to completely open the Spanish border, and all countries will compete to transport military supplies into Spain. Therefore, no matter how diverse their opinions or how different their tendencies are, they should not hope for the plan to be destroyed when the surveillance work begins tomorrow. Eden further stated that the Mediterranean is Britain's most important artery, but its position is very broad, and it is not impossible to accommodate others. Therefore, Britain has no intention of monopolizing it, and Britain has always adhered to the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Agreement, and has never had any intention of aggression or hostility towards other countries, because the British do not advocate mutual animosity. Britain's attitude towards the Mediterranean is the same as its attitude towards the Red Sea.</p>
<p>Eden generally discussed international economic issues, stating that removing trade barriers is the most effective way to eliminate political tensions. The currency declaration between Britain, the United States, and France also has this intention. The trade agreement between Britain and the United States is in its preliminary discussions and will definitely benefit global economic cooperation in the future. Furthermore, an international investigation into the fair allocation of raw materials is underway. Britain is willing to actively cooperate in other areas besides tariff policy restrictions in order to eliminate the economic causes of international conflicts. Eden further stated that the League of Nations is not dead, nor is it on the verge of death. Although its strength is limited, it already has considerable influence in political matters, as can be seen from the containment of the dispute between France and Italy. Today, the biggest obstacle to the League's recovery is the division of countries into two major factions: one standing within the walls of the League of Nations and the other standing outside. It must be known that Geneva is a large place and can accommodate all countries in the world, regardless of their political differences or different political systems, as long as they have the desire to cooperate and maintain world peace. He continued, the German and Russian governments' joining the naval agreement is truly visionary. Furthermore, no one should misunderstand the increasing friendship between Britain and France. Looking at the overall situation, it is still satisfactory. He knows that no one needs war, so the ability of European countries to work together to eliminate opinions is better than it was a year ago. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 19th)</p>

<h3>Non-Intervention Committee Discusses British Compromise Proposal</h3>
<p>First Part Handed Over to Technical Committee; Order of Implementation of Other Parts Proves Thorny</p>
<p>[London] The small-scale naval officers' committee of the Adjustment Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War met at 11:00 this morning to discuss the first part of the British compromise proposal, which includes: ㊀ The establishment of monitoring agencies in various Spanish ports; ㊁ The restoration of land border monitoring measures in Spain. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 pm. Well-informed sources claim that during the committee meeting, the representative of a certain country proposed to amend this part. British sources said that the main points of this proposal will not be changed as a result. The most important part of this proposal is the order of implementation of the two methods for withdrawing volunteers from various countries and recognizing belligerent groups. Once the sub-committee submits it for discussion, another fierce debate will ensue. (Central News Agency, Havas, 20th)</p>

<h3>Radio Inventor Marconi Passed Away Yesterday</h3>
<p>Dedicated to Scientific Research in His Youth; Invented Many Practical Radios</p>
<p>[Rome] Famous Italian radio inventor Marquis Marconi passed away today at the age of sixty-three. He was born in Bologna and was most interested in physics at an early age. At the age of twenty, after reading the experimental report of Professor Hertz, the inventor of X-rays, he immersed himself in the study of electricity. In 1895, he tested the wireless transmission of Morse code for two miles in Pontecchio, realizing the importance of this invention. He immediately returned to England and told Sir Preece, the chief engineer of the British Post Office, who greatly appreciated it. As a result, Marconi became a world-renowned genius scientist at the age of twenty-two. At that time, various European countries competed to invite him. In 1899, he installed the first radio station in the Kiel Canal. In 1900, he invented the principle of broadcasting news using long and short waves. In 1901, he began to install a transatlantic radio station. The following year, he installed radio equipment on the American mail ship "Lucania". When the ship crossed the Atlantic, it was able to communicate with New York and London at all times. Since then, radio science has changed rapidly. By 1906, radio stations began broadcasting music programs, and radiotelephones first appeared in Italy in 1914. After the European War, Marconi once entered politics and attended the Treaty of Versailles conference in 1918 as an Italian representative. However, a year later, he returned to the study of radio science, especially emphasizing the practicality of shortwave radio. He made many inventions in the past ten years, and his contribution to the world's shipping, commerce, politics, and journalism is unparalleled. In recent years, his most focused research has been the ultra-shortwave radio used for radio image transmission. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1919. In addition to scientific research, he also enjoyed traveling. He is currently the director of the Italian Academy of Sciences, a member of the Senate, and a member of the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party. After the outbreak of the Abyssinian War two years ago, he offered to go to East Africa to serve. (Central News Agency, Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>⊙Rome: The "creator of modern radio" in Italy, Marconi, died of heart disease at 3:30 this morning at the age of 63. Marconi was not the inventor of radio, as the first to invent radio was the German Hertz, but the modern world's ability to practically use radio is due to Marconi's tireless research on radio.</p>
<p>Marconi was born on April 25, 1874. His father was Italian, and his mother was Irish. When Marconi grew up, his father initially wanted him to study music, but Marconi refused and devoted himself to the study of radio. His father tried to stop him and even wanted to destroy the equipment he used for research, but finally, with the mediation of his mother, his father reluctantly agreed to his wishes and no longer interfered.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-one, his first experiment was successful, and Hertz's radio waves proved its effectiveness. At that time, Italy did not believe it, but his mother was deeply convinced. She took him to London and, with the help of her family, obtained registration with the British government, becoming the founder of practical radio. This was in 1896, when Marconi was only twenty-two years old.</p>
<p>In 1901, radio transmission was a great success, able to transmit messages between Cornwall and the Isle of Wight, 183 miles apart. A few months later, Marconi's radio crossed the Atlantic, communicating between Cornwall and Newfoundland. The world was amazed, and the scientific community, governments, and newspapers of various countries celebrated its success. Ships began to install radio equipment, and countless ships in distress at sea sent out distress signals through the airwaves and were rescued. In 1913, when the American giant ship "Titanic" was sunk by a German submarine, more than 1,000 people were rescued. When they arrived in New York, Marconi was also in the city. These rescued people walked in formation to Marconi's residence and shouted three times to Marconi as their savior.</p>
<p>In 1909, Marconi received the Nobel Prize in Physics. During the European War, Marconi's radios were used by the British and Italian governments for communication with naval bases and ships at sea, with great success.</p>
<p>In 1914, Marconi was awarded the title of nobility by the Italian government, took up the position of Senator, and became a free citizen of Rome. After the end of the European War, Marconi was ordered to participate in the Paris Peace Conference as one of the Italian representatives. After the establishment of the treaty, Marconi devoted himself to the research of radio again, and various new inventions appeared one after another, such as the "long-distance one-way radio" in 1923 and the success of ultra-shortwave transmission in 1931, which were famous in the scientific community.</p>
<p>Although Marconi was a great scientist, he did not have the inevitable quirks and behaviors of other scientists. Marconi was elegant and self-appreciating, and liked to dress well, with the demeanor of a Confucian scholar. Marconi was not tall, but his forehead was high, his nose was prominent, and his appearance was quite dignified, making him admirable. He spoke English fluently, was good at French, and liked riding, shooting, and hunting. Marconi married twice in his life. His first wife was Irish and had one son and two daughters. They later divorced. His current wife is Italian. Marconi firmly believed that radio could be used for interstellar communication in the future and that there were living beings and humans on planets other than Earth, and that the power of radio could transcend the atmosphere and reach other celestial bodies.

<h3>Zhang Qingyu's Unit of the Puppet "East Hebei" Security Force Eliminated</h3>
<p>Zhang Executed by Traitor Yin; Extreme Chaos in Tong County</p>
<p>Tianjin correspondence: The First Brigade of the "East Hebei" puppet organization's security force, stationed in Tong County, with a force of 1,500 men, was originally reorganized from the former subordinates of Ma Tingfu, a brigade commander under Yu Xuezhong. It was considered one of the more elite units in the puppet security force. After the Lugouqiao Incident, the Japanese army stationed in Tong County suddenly indicated that Zhang Qingyu, the commander of the First Brigade, was plotting to lead his troops to revolt and return to the national government. They immediately placed Zhang under surveillance. Later, the Japanese army still felt that Zhang was unstable and ordered Zhang to lead his troops out of Tong County on the morning of the 16th, to be stationed in Daliqiao, a suburb of Tong County, and to build defensive fortifications against the 29th Army in the Pingxi area. Zhang knew something was amiss and was afraid of being eliminated by the Japanese army by taking advantage of the situation. Therefore, starting at noon that day, he refused to obey orders and acted on his own. The part of the First Brigade stationed in Tong County city clashed with the Japanese army at 6:00 pm that day, entering a state of chaos that night. Zhang himself was lured to the puppet government by the traitor Yin on the same day under the guise of negotiating terms and was placed under guard. He was then sent to the Japanese special service agency stationed in Tong County. It is rumored that Yin, under the orders of the Japanese, executed Zhang Qingyu on the 17th. The part of the puppet security force outside Tong County city was surrounded and disarmed by the Japanese army before it could mutiny. However, the mutinous troops in the city are still resisting in the streets, and the situation has not been completely resolved as of the morning of the 18th, so the city is still in a state of chaos. All four gates of Tong County are tightly closed, and the people cannot escape. The casualties and losses of the military and civilians are not yet known in detail. It is said that in addition to Zhang Qingyu, the units of Zhang Yantian and Li Haitian of the "East Hebei" puppet security force were also former subordinates of Ma Tingfu. At the beginning of Yin's rebellion, it was a temporary compromise. Although Yin held the position of chief of the puppet government, he had no authority to command the influential leaders such as Zhang Yantian, Li Haitian, and Zhang Qingyu. However, Yin always used his flattery to the Japanese side, so he often relied on the power of the Japanese to suppress influential leaders. The officers and soldiers of the puppet security force had long expressed dissatisfaction with Yin, but they were afraid of the Japanese side and could not act. And when Yin compiled the puppet security supplementary general team and appointed his confidant Li Baozhang as the team leader, Zhang and Li and other traitors hated him even more. Therefore, internal strife in "East Hebei" was about to erupt. Zhang Qingyu's execution and the elimination of his subordinates have made the other puppet security teams feel a sense of shared peril. The Japanese side had already foreseen this, so it has strengthened its suppression of Tang, Yu, Feng, Luo, and other places to prevent mutiny. The fate of the traitors can be seen. (18th)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou</h3>
<p>Xiamen: Gambling Dens Suddenly Revive; Quanzhou and Zhangzhou: Coastal Areas Implement Strict Baojia System</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Following the Lugouqiao Incident, Commander Ohkuma of the Japanese 5th Torpedo Squadron stationed in Taiwan immediately led the cruiser Yubari and the destroyer Asagao to Xiamen on the 9th, claiming to be on a cruise and having no specific mission. On the 12th, the Asagao sailed to Fuzhou, while the Yubari remained in Xiamen. However, Japan has always regarded Xiamen and Fuzhou as its own naval ports, coming and going freely. Usually, more than ten or five or six ships would arrive in a group, staying for several days before leaving. It was common for two or three ships to stay in port. Therefore, the people of Fuzhou and Xiamen had long ceased to be surprised by the arrival of Japanese warships. However, after the Lugouqiao Incident, the gambling dens of a certain nationality, which had been banned in Xiamen for several years, suddenly revived within a few days. Gambling was openly conducted in places like Siming South Road, Chenguang Road, and Jukou Street, with the entrances of the gambling dens crowded like markets, operating all night long. This is particularly noteworthy. In the southern Fujian area, the coastal area of Jinjiang County's Jinan Third District, outside the south gate of Quanzhou, has always been an important military location for the coastal defense of Fujian Province, separated from Taiwan by only a narrow strip of water. It has long been an area where people of a certain nationality mixed. Recently, doctors, water carriers, and prostitutes from a certain country have suddenly increased significantly and are very active. The Third District Office has implemented strict Baojia organization, forming a strong men's investigation team and a communication team, numbering hundreds of people, divided into two investigation teams and one communication team. Members are selected from the Lianbao (joint guarantee) and are filled with trained instructors from the strong men's training class. On the 12th, the District Office convened a joint district meeting of the Lianbao directors and Baojia chiefs, resolving the following: (1) Organize a strong men's base team, to be established before the 30th of this month. (2) Organize a strong men's communication team. (3) Vigorously implement a general mobilization throughout the district, conduct a household census through an investigation team. (4) Complete the telephone network throughout the district to prevent the activities of ruffians. Furthermore, Huian County in Quanzhou is also separated from Taiwan by only a narrow strip of water, with Chongwu being particularly close to Taiwan, holding a similar position to Jinan. It has also long been a place where unscrupulous merchants collude with ruffians to conduct smuggling. Recently, rumors have been rampant, so the second district chief, Chen Guoliang, specially convened a meeting of the Bao chiefs of Chongwu, Xiaozha, and Daku and other coastal areas, resolving the following: (1) Each Lianbao will set up a messenger sentry to transmit news and communicate information. (2) Starting immediately, each Bao group will establish a patrol team to investigate and arrest traitors. In addition, in Dongshan County in Zhangzhou, warships of a certain country often arrive, and at the same time, ruffians collude with unscrupulous merchants to smuggle and sell counterfeit currency in the county. On the morning of the 14th of this month, two cruisers from a certain country suddenly arrived, slowly entering and surveying the Dongshan port for more than an hour before leaving. The water police and the county government, upon receiving the report, ordered the coastal areas to pay attention to the movements of foreign ships. Dongshan, geographically linking Fujian, Guangdong, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines, is a militarily important location for naval warfare and has long been the focus of attention of a certain country.</p>
<p>On the 12th and 13th, it was widely rumored here that Japanese residents and citizens in Xiamen had been ordered to evacuate. Later, it was verified that this was not the case. On the 16th, Takahashi Shigeru, the acting Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen, answered questions from a certain newspaper reporter, denying the evacuation of Japanese residents, saying that he had not received such instructions. The reporter also asked, "If, unfortunately, a large-scale war breaks out between China and Japan in southern Fujian, the Japanese residents can take the ships back to their country at any time, but what about the citizens of your country?" Takahashi replied, "Protecting residents and citizens is both our responsibility. There are also specific plans for the wartime protection of residents." It is noted that Xiamen has a population of 180,000, and there are nearly 20,000 Taiwanese Japanese citizens, accounting for one-tenth. Many of them have been engaged in their businesses for generations and own real estate. In terms of personnel and economy, it is not easy to evacuate them immediately, unlike the Japanese residents in Xiamen, who number only two or three hundred.</p>
<h3>Chen Lianbo's Arrest Warrant Revoked</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: Mr. Chen Lianbo, former general manager of Nanyang Tobacco Co., Ltd., was sued by Wang Songxian for an account issue. Mr. Chen did not appear in court, resulting in an arrest warrant being issued. The other day, Wang Songxian hired a lawyer and requested the revocation of the arrest warrant at the Hong Kong Magistracy. Lawyer Luo Wenjin represented the late Mr. Chen and was present in court for a hearing. At the opening of the court, Wang's lawyer, Davidson, stood up and stated the reasons for requesting the revocation of the arrest warrant, saying that in June 1934, Wang had provided some materials to the court, causing the government to order the police to arrest Chen. On June 6th of that year, Chen was summoned to court for questioning. At that time, the case was adjourned for a week. When it was brought up again, Chen did not appear, and the court confiscated his bail according to the law. Wang was one of the shareholders who owned the most shares in the company at that time. He felt that many things should not have happened for the sake of the interests of the company, so the arrest warrant was issued. Since then, Wang has had nothing to do with the company and has severed relations with the case. He is now an ordinary person and does not want to bring up the old story. Wang also believes that even if Chen is guilty of a certain event, it is not a criminal offense. Wang has also accepted lawyer Luo Wenjin's explanation of the circumstances under which Chen was accused at that time, believing that if Luo's lawyer's statement is true, Chen has a good defense. The reason why Wang and Chen were unable to return to Hong Kong was due to him blocking them. Now Wang knows that this matter is completely out of his control and is managed by the court. However, in his opinion, if Wang does not file a lawsuit, the police will not continue to execute it. Then, the police commissioner stated that this matter happened because someone made an oath to the court and the lawyer testified. The police are just doing things according to the law. Now that there is this explanation, he will not object to the revocation of the arrest warrant. Then, lawyer Luo Wenjin stood up and said that the court had heard what Dai and Liang had said, and believed that the arrest warrant had been revoked. He now represents Chen, believing that this revocation of the arrest warrant is not without reason. The plaintiff's request should be granted. After listening to Shi Si's words, he approved the case and said that if the defendant had appeared in court on the day of the hearing and the plaintiff had no sufficient evidence to present, the charges would naturally not be established.</p>
<h3>Progress of the Jinggan Railway</h3>
<p>Laying Track in Three Phases; Working Day and Night and Building the Guimei Line</p>
<p>Tunxi Dispatch: Since the start of construction, the Xuan Gui section of the Jinggan Railway has progressed rapidly. The southern section passes through the mountainous area of Huangshan and advances simultaneously from Guixi in Jiangxi Province. The roadbed bridges have been largely constructed. The earthwork engineering of the Anhui section from Sunjiabu to Zhengzhou is also nearing completion. Bridges and culverts are being rushed. The Engineering Bureau has stipulated that the track laying project will be carried out in three phases. The first phase, starting from Sunjiabu to Qiaotoupu, has already begun on the 1st of this month. The second phase starts from Qiaotoupu to Wan'an in Xiuning. The third phase starts from Wan'an to Qimen. It is planned to complete all three phases by the end of the year. In order to facilitate the transportation of materials, the bureau has also set up a material factory in Wuhu and built a branch line connecting the Jiangnan Railway. Thirty freight cars have been purchased from Shanghai so that the materials transported by land and water can be transported from the Jiangnan Road to Sunjiabu for use. The project south of Sunjiabu is divided into two major parts, Anhui and Jiangxi. The Anhui section is divided into Xuan (cheng) • Ning (guo) • Ningji (xi) • Jixi (Huizhou) • Xixiu (ning) • Xiuqi (men) • five general sections, with nearly 20,000 workers. The Jiangxi section is divided into Fu (liang) Le (ping) • Le Wan (nian) • Gui (xi) and other sections, with also over 10,000 workers. They are now working day and night in different sections. The poles and lines for telephones and telegrams along the line have been erected and communication has begun to facilitate communication and coordination of the project. It is expected that the entire line will be completed in March next year. After this section is open to traffic, the existing engineering personnel and road workers will continue to advance south to build the route from Guixi to Meixian in Guangdong, connecting with the planned Guangmei Line and the planned Zhang (shu) Mei branch line of the Zhejgan Line, completing the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway and direct traffic. In addition, the Nanjing-Xuancheng section is operated by the Jiangnan Company. The Ministry of Railways is currently negotiating with the company to take it over as a state-owned enterprise. If the price is too high to reach an agreement, it is said that a railway will be built from Nanjing to Sunjiabu, abandoning Wuhu and Xuancheng (July 14).</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Writings on Rural Hubei</h3>
<p>— Cheng Jun</p>
<p>Passing through Tuanfeng to Huanggang</p>
<p>In the morning light of June 1st, I set off from Hankou on an inland river steamer belonging to the Construction Department to eastern Hubei. After traveling sixty li to Yangluo, I entered Huanggang and then arrived at Tuanfeng via Cangzibu, a total distance of one hundred and thirty li. This shipping line was originally run by merchants, who, in their pursuit of profit, often overloaded the ships, leading to accidents. The Construction Department then took it back and managed it, limiting the number of passengers and goods. Unexpectedly, after two years of reorganization, it was still not perfect. Tickets were sold in large quantities, so when boarding the ship, people were crowded and the order was extremely chaotic. Later arrivals found no place to stand, while "fellow villagers" in military uniforms often did not buy tickets and brought others with them, leaving the ticket inspectors helpless. A woman was squeezed to stand on the side of the ship and asked the ticket inspector, "I paid for a ticket, why is there no seat?" The ticket inspector glared at her and replied sharply, "Who told you to come late?" as if he wanted to vent the anger he had suffered earlier on the woman, leaving her helpless.</p>
<p>Tuanfeng is located on the banks of the Yangtze River, with rows of houses and a history of prosperous commerce. The county of Huanggang produces local cloth, tobacco, and cotton, all of which are gathered and distributed here. The county seat was once moved here, demonstrating the importance of its location. Its specialty is local cloth, which is sold to neighboring counties and even as far as Wuhan. At its peak, sales reached more than 200,000 bolts. It is purely handmade, and the rural economy relies on it to a considerable extent. After the great flood of 1931, the situation changed, sales became sluggish, and foreign goods took the opportunity to invade. There is a cloth industry association in the area, and when I inquired about the quantity and value of production over the years, the person in charge seemed unable to answer. It seems that the rise and fall of local cloth is related to the prosperity or decline of the market, and they did not want to reveal the true news to others. In Tuanfeng's hotels, people came and went, whispering to each other, with worried and frightened expressions between their brows. I asked the innkeeper, who said that there had been a large group of bandits fighting with government troops near here recently, and the sound of gunfire had not stopped all night. It was heard that the bandits had retreated not far away and were afraid of their return, so they were still living in fear.</p>
<p>On the 2nd, I left Tuanfeng and traveled sixty li to reach the county seat of Huanggang. Huanggang was once the State of Xianzi during the Zhou Dynasty, which was later merged into Chu and called Zhucheng. The name of the county changed several times throughout history, and it was not until the Sui Dynasty that it was named Huanggang. From the Tang and Song dynasties to the Qing Dynasty, it was the seat of the prefecture government, known as Qian and Huangzhou. After the Republic of China, it was changed to a county, with a population of over 800,000 and a land area of more than 27,000 square li. The northeast is mountainous, with rugged roads, while the southwest is a plain, with the flow of the Ba River and the Yangtze River, making transportation very convenient. The county seat is located on the banks of the Yangtze River, controlling eastern Hubei and Wuhan Jiujiang, forming a mutual support, and the situation is very important. The Administrative Commissioner's Office of the Second District has moved here from Qichun.</p>
<p>The county is large and rich in resources, and it is also close to Wuhan, so culture was introduced early. The people are enterprising. During the imperial examination era of the Qing Dynasty, it produced the most talent. After the Republic of China, it became a county with "many officials," comparable to Liling in Hunan and Gangzi in Guizhou. The most famous are Xiao Yaonan, the former governor of Hubei and provincial governor, Fang Benren, the director of Jiangxi, Xu Yuanquan, the director of the Sichuan-Hubei-Hunan-Guizhou border region, Wan Yaohuang, the commander of the 13th Division, and Zhu Huaibing, the commander of the 94th Division, all of whom are natives of Huanggang. There are many others serving in the military and political circles. A man from Huanggang proudly told the reporter that all agencies in Wuhan have people from Huanggang participating. If there are no people from Huanggang, then the agency cannot be considered an agency. Examining the facts, it is not an exaggeration. The customs of the people vary inversely between the riverside and the inner mountains. The riverside people are cunning and used to extravagance, while the inner mountain people eat food and drink well water, and are simple and honest. The concept of region and family is extremely deep. Clan leaders use this psychology to cultivate special forces, exploiting the villagers and holding up the government, doing whatever they want. As a result, the gentry have extremely high power, and the government has to depend on them. There are so-called "big kings" and "four diamond kings" among the bad gentry, whose power can be imagined.</p>
<p>About two li from the city, there is the Red Cliff, and all travelers to this place visit it. This place was originally called Red Nose Isle. It is not the same place as the Red Cliff where Sun Quan and Cao Cao fought. Since Su Shi wrote the Rhapsody on the Red Cliff, this place has become famous, while the true Red Cliff in Jiayu has been buried and is no longer prominent. It can be seen that 830,000 troops are no match for a literati's pen. However, the mountains and rivers in this place are beautiful and suitable for sightseeing. There are pavilions and towers facing each other, such as the Erfu Hall and the Fanghe Pavilion, which are very elegant. There are countless famous calligraphy and paintings engraved on stone tablets. There are also antiques such as the eight-tone fish, which makes eight different sounds when tapped. It is rock-like in texture and engraved with poems and prose. When Chairman Jiang visited this place, he instructed the manager to prevent people from stealing and selling it, so ordinary people cannot easily see it. There are small stones with flower patterns produced under the isle, which are very exquisite, even more so than those produced in Yuhua Terrace in Nanjing. There is a pagoda in the east of the city, facing the Red Cliff, made of huge blue stones, and the architecture is very magnificent, but unfortunately I did not climb it to see the ships coming and going and hear the sad cries of the fish and dragons.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Incest Case Scheduled for Continued Hearing</p>
<p>The incest case of Zhang Shigu, who killed his father outside the North Gate of this county, has been prosecuted by the District Procuratorate and heard by the Criminal Court. Judge Wang Ruyi is presiding over the hearing. Zhang Shigu firmly denied the charges and made a counter-confession. It is learned that the District Court has summoned Zhang Baoding, Tang Shuqin, Xu Aitang, and others to continue the hearing at 9:00 a.m. on the 24th.</p>
<p>Russian Youth Detained at the Station</p>
<p>At Xinqiao Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, three Russian youths were seen walking through the station from Shanghai on the morning of the 19th, carrying a package. The platoon leader of the stationed military police saw them and, suspecting their appearance, followed them. When they reached the Mingxing Bridge Station in this city, the Russians, seeing the situation was not good, turned back the way they had come. When they reached Xinqiao Station, the platoon leader, together with the stationmaster and the local Bao chief, strictly questioned them. However, the Russians did not understand Chinese and their words were vague. When their package was inspected, it contained 21 yuan in foreign currency, a six-inch revolver, 65 bullets, a telescope, and a war map. That night, they were detained by the military police at the new station. On the morning of the 20th, they were escorted to the county's military police department for a preliminary interrogation and then escorted to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters for verification.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul Requests Protection of Residents</p>
<p>With the North China Incident becoming increasingly serious, Japanese residents in Suzhou are preparing to return to their country. The Japanese Consul in Suzhou, Ichikawa Shuzo, visited County Chief Deng at the county government at 10:00 a.m. on the 20th. As County Chief Deng was out on official business, he was received by Secretary Huang Kejia of the Foreign Affairs Department. Consul Ichikawa requested the county government to provide special protection to the Japanese residents in Suzhou. Secretary Huang of the Foreign Affairs Department expressed his acceptance of the Japanese Consul's request. The consul then left. A suspicious merchant ship of a certain country, which was seized by the police department between Huguan and Wangting the other day, was escorted out of the country on the 20th.</p>
<p>Zhang's Society Sends Telegram to Song</p>
<p>The Zhang's National Studies Lecture Society sent a telegram to Song Zheyuan's 29th Army, which stated: "To Chairman Song of Peiping and the soldiers of the 29th Army. The Ronglu are greedy and insatiable, and the frontiers are limited. Liaodong has been sullied with the smell of livestock, and Hebei is troubled by planning. We believe that our 29th Army shares the same loyalty and indignation, and has always been known for its power. Now, facing the brunt of a strong enemy, we are even more capable of defeating the near capital. We hope that your tiger steps will be more comfortable and your fierce leap will be farther, that you will completely annihilate the fierce enemy and report the deep hatred. We, the colleagues, look forward to your departure from afar, and we only think of throwing away our pens. We humbly donate a meal to pay the three armies, and the money is paid by mail and telegraph. Zhang's National Studies Lecture Society." Song Zheyuan replied by telegram: "To the Zhang's National Studies Lecture Society. I have respectfully received your telegram. It is our duty to defend the land. I am ashamed and grateful for your praise and donation. I am sending this telegram to thank you. Song Zheyuan."</p>

<p>Sharp Decrease in Passenger Traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway</p>
<p>Due to the serious impact of the North China situation and the scorching weather, there has been a sharp decrease in passenger traffic between Shanghai and Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. It is estimated that passenger trains run four times a day between Shanghai and Hangzhou, with only about 200 passengers on each trip, a decrease of about half compared to before. Therefore, the revenue from passenger and freight fares has also decreased sharply.</p>

<p>Prison Break in Minquan County</p>
<p>According to visitors from Minquan County, three prison break incidents have occurred in the county's prison this month. Apart from those caught on the spot, seven bandits have escaped one after another. In the first prison break, bandits Wu Xiangzhe and others escaped from the prison wall by climbing over the roof of their prison cage. Afterward, the authorities pursued them, but it was difficult to capture them during the green gauze curtain, so they closed the city and searched the case, and captured only Wu Xiangting and two others that night, while the rest escaped without a trace. The second incident involved a bandit named Song Wu digging a hole under his cage and escaping from the prison cell, climbing over the wall and jumping out. The guard on duty saw him and fired several shots but missed. The police team was dispatched and gunshots were fired everywhere. The county chief, awakened from his dream, also went shirtless and held a gun, personally leading the police to pursue him, but he was ultimately escaped. The third incident involved several bandits and drug offenders trying to escape over the wall. Fortunately, they were discovered by the guards on the roof of the prison, who opened fire. The escapees were frightened and all retreated, so they did not escape.</p>

<h3>Kita Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Summoning Naval and Army Personnel from Outside, Reporting on the Journey to Beijing</p>
<p>Kita Seiichi, the army attaché at the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai, arrived in Beijing on the 18th evening. He summoned Otokido Sanji, the army attaché stationed in Beijing, and Hidaka Noburo, the counselor, to hear a report and discuss diplomatic and military actions to be taken in Beijing and Shanghai when necessary. He also paid a visit to He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Administration, to inquire about the attitude of our military authorities towards the Lugouqiao Incident. Minister He replied, "The current tense situation is entirely caused by the Japanese side dispatching a large number of army and navy personnel. We have no intention of challenging, but for the sake of self-defense, we have to make preparations. At the same time, whether the incident expands or not depends on the Japanese side, not China." Kita considered the situation clear, so he took the overnight express train from Beijing the night before last at 11 PM and arrived here at 7:40 AM yesterday. Okazaki Hideshi, the Japanese Consul in Shanghai, and Tajiri, the intelligence chief, and others went to greet him. After Kita got into the car, he went to his residence to rest. He then met with naval attaché Honda, Hasegawa, the commander of the Third Fleet, and other naval and army personnel from outside to report on the journey to Beijing and discuss concrete future directions. After the meeting, Kita telegraphed all the results to the Army Ministry in his country.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Safe and Sound</h3>
<p>The Volunteer Corps Can Mobilize to Maintain Order in a Few Hours</p>
<p>According to the Ta Kung Pao, an executive of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai International Volunteer Corps told a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao that although the Shanghai International Volunteer Corps has not made special preparations, if the Shanghai situation requires the Volunteer Corps to mobilize, it can be done in a few hours. However, it is unwilling to do so unless it is absolutely necessary to maintain the security of the Public Concession. According to Stirling Fessenden, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, judging from the current situation, it seems unlikely that China and Japan will fight in the Shanghai area for a while. However, the Municipal Council is closely watching the situation. If a serious war occurs, the emotions of the Chinese and Japanese people are likely to become very strong. If it is a minor disturbance, the Municipal Council's police force can handle it. Therefore, the Volunteer Corps is unwilling to mobilize unless it is absolutely necessary. If the war extends to the Shanghai area and the two armies seem to be disturbing the Public Concession, then the troops of various countries stationed in Shanghai and the Volunteer Corps will, as in 1932, jointly assume the responsibility of protection. Fessenden also clearly stated that the Volunteer Corps will never be summoned in advance to avoid hindering business. However, when a reporter asked Lieutenant Colonel Graham, the commander of the Volunteer Corps, whether the district and the Volunteer Corps had made preparations for mobilization, he declined to comment.</p>

<h3>The Market Stabilizes and Morale is Boosted After Chairman Chiang's Speech is Released</h3>
<p>All Are Willing to Prepare to Sacrifice Under the Leadership of the Central Government. The Ten-Person Group Telegraphs 1,000 Yuan Yesterday to Show Loyalty to the Nation</p>
<p>Since the Central Government released Chairman Chiang's speech in Kuling, stating our country's solemn position and declaring four points of peace, the people's morale has been exceptionally high. People from all walks of life in this city have expressed their determination to prepare to sacrifice for the survival of the nation at the final moment with a solemn and calm spirit under the leadership of the Central Government. Therefore, the situation in this city has stabilized a lot, and the trading market has also stabilized. As for the Westerners, they also expressed deep sympathy for Chairman Chiang's speech, believing that the points stated were solemn in purpose and clear in attitude, and that they were the most practical way to solve the Sino-Japanese problem. They all hoped that the Japanese government would rein in at the precipice, so that the situation in the Far East could be stabilized.</p>
<p>The Chinese National Salvation Ten-Person Group United Association is a group that was established after the May Fourth Movement in 1919 to resist Japan and save the country. In recent years, due to environmental restrictions, there have been few activities, but they have encouraged each other and waited patiently for the time to repay the country. Yesterday, members of the association recited Chairman Chiang's speech expressing his position on Japan, and immediately convened an emergency meeting. Ren Lingpin was elected as chairman, and Zhu Changli, Li Xianyao, Xu Lixiang, Weng Guoxun, Kong Shangde, Tang Dale, Zhang Qiafu, and others jointly discussed: (1) Telegraphing to Chairman Chiang to express support for his position on Japan, and remitting 1,000 yuan to show the will of the people; (2) Deciding to send a letter to the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Japanese Support Preparatory Association to apply for participation; (3) Deciding to convene a general meeting of members to discuss ways to show loyalty to the country. The original telegram is as follows: Nanjing "Jieshi" Chairman Chiang Xun Jian No. Morning reading of the speech, declaring the Lugouqiao Incident as the final moment of the nation's resolute sacrifice, and listing four points as the boundary line for this moment. If the enemy dares to invade this boundary line, it will be an all-out war of sacrifice. All members of the association cheered upon hearing this, and in addition to following the guidance and preparing to be loyal to the country, we hereby send a telegram of 1,000 yuan to supplement military needs and show the will of the people. We respectfully send this telegram, and we implore you to take action. Chinese National Salvation Ten-Person Group United Association Koutou,</p>
<h3>All Circles in Shanghai Rise Up to Face the National Crisis Together</h3>
<p>The Silk Industry Collects National Defense Donations Starting Yesterday. Maritime Workers Establish an Anti-Japanese Support Association</p>
<p>The prelude to the war has begun. All circles in Shanghai, with the national crisis being serious, consider this the final moment. The soldiers on the front lines are fighting the Japanese in bloody battles, and the people in the rear should accumulate financial resources and enthusiastically contribute. Yesterday, the silk industry collected national defense donations and the engine crew donated salary to comfort the troops, which was very enthusiastic. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Collects National Defense Donations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Association sent a letter to all members yesterday, saying: Dear Sirs, Case Investigation, the second resolution of the seventh members' meeting on February 21, 1936, proposed that each shop should contribute a certain amount based on its turnover to assist the soldiers fighting against Japan. The detailed method was handed over to the executive committee to formulate. After the Lugouqiao Incident, the news of the war was sometimes relaxed and sometimes tense. The national crisis is serious and has reached the final moment. The soldiers on the front lines are fighting the Japanese in bloody battles, and the people in the rear should accumulate financial resources and enthusiastically contribute to encourage the soldiers. Therefore, the 14th executive committee meeting on July 15 of this year, based on the resolution of the previous general meeting, proposed to discuss the method of donating money to resist Japan. It was decided to name it the National Defense Donation. Starting from the 20th of this month, each piece of real silk goods will be charged an additional 5 cents, each piece of interwoven goods will be charged an additional 1 cent, and each piece of foreign silk will be charged an additional 2 cents. Notify the members and inform the inspection association to handle it together when the time comes. In addition to sending a separate letter, this letter is urgently delivered, and you are requested to check and comply.</p>
<p>Engine Crew Donates Salary Increase</p>
<p>The China Engine Crew Union yesterday notified all engine crew members to donate one month's salary increase to comfort the soldiers fighting against Japan on the front lines. The original letter said: Dear Sirs, According to letters from all engine crew members of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haili, Jianghua, Taishun, Kuaili, and Sanbei Company's Ningxing, Longxing, Songshan, and other ships, since the Lugouqiao Incident, people from all over the country have been raising donations or donating salaries to purchase comforting items and organizing assistance associations to support each other. Our engine crew members should not be inferior to others in loving the country. A suggestion was specially made, stating that after the entire engine crew of each ship made a request for each ship to increase their treatment, the Ministry of Communications authorities approved it, and it will be announced soon. Since Lugouqiao, thanks to our loyal and brave 29th Army fighting against the enemy in bloody battles, willing to fill the tomb with defending the territory, their loyalty and courage can touch the clouds. All compatriots in the country are excited and indignant. The rear assistance is imminent as the war is getting worse day by day. We are willing to donate all of this month's salary increase to comfort the front lines, and we ask all engine crew members to act together. This suggestion deeply expresses the patriotic enthusiasm of our engine crew members, and it should be unanimously approved. We hope that all members will enthusiastically donate to gather a large amount of money to send to the front lines to comfort the soldiers and boost morale.</p>
<p>Accountants Send Telegrams of Condolence</p>
<p>Chairman Wei of Beiping, Chairman Ma, Mayor Qin, and all the generals of the 29th Army: The Lugouqiao Incident has once again relied on the local Sui soldiers to calmly resist and defend, and the whole country is deeply grateful and the morale is high. We are even more united against the enemy. We also hope that you will encourage the soldiers who are sleeping on their weapons to strive for the survival of our nation and the importance of the survival of the country. The 470 million people of the whole country are willing to go to death together and swear not to yield. We respectfully send this telegram and look forward to your great achievements.

<h3>Qingdao and Tianjin National Ships Suspend Sailing</h3>
<p>Passengers Avoiding the Heat All Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>Tianjin National Ships Suspend Sailing</p>
<p>After the Tanggu Wharf and the newly built cargo warehouse of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were forcibly occupied by the Japanese army on the 19th, the goods and cargo stored in the warehouse, worth more than 1.5 million yuan, can no longer be loaded and unloaded. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tianjin ships have no place to berth. Yesterday, the company officially announced that all North Ocean liners, starting from today's departure of the Xinfeng ship, will suspend sailing to Tianjin and only go to Yantai and Weihaiwei. All the goods that had been loaded for Tianjin on the previous two days were also returned yesterday.</p>
<p>Qingdao Decides to Stop Sailing</p>
<p>In recent years, every summer, Shanghai passengers going to Qingdao have been very crowded. Eight or nine out of ten are going to the Jiaozhou Bay area to escape the summer heat. Each shipping company has been adding special Shanghai-Qingdao ships since June. The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company specially opened the Nanhua Sanxin ship on the Shanghai-Qingdao special route from the 9th of this month. Now that the second ship has just been opened, the Lugouqiao Incident has occurred, and Qingdao has suddenly become tense. The company also decided yesterday to officially announce the suspension of the Shanghai-Qingdao route from today.</p>
<p>Heat-Avoiding Passengers All Return</p>
<p>In the past half month, Shanghai passengers going to Qingdao to escape the summer heat have been coming and going. On this trip of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haizhen ship to Qingdao, all the dining rooms and first and second-class cabins were full. However, when this Haizhen ship arrived in Qingdao, these heat-avoiding passengers who had arrived had all moved away a few days ago. Qingdao, a summer resort, has become unusually deserted within a week. Therefore, all the heat-avoiding passengers on the Haizhen ship dared not go ashore when they arrived in Qingdao and immediately requested Captain Hu Xiyuan to return to Shanghai on the original ship. Not a single person went ashore. Yesterday, the Haizhen ship returned to Shanghai, and the passengers who went on the original ship to avoid the heat did not lose a single person and still took the original ship back to Shanghai. According to the passengers, the market in Qingdao is very desolate, but the people seem to be still stable.</p>
<h3>Japanese Nationals Evacuated from the Taiyuan Area Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday to Return to Their Country</h3>

They arrived here yesterday and stayed at hotels such as the Tokiwa-kan and Hinode-kan on Haining Road. According to reporters, the Japanese nationals took the Nagasaki Maru back to Japan at 9 AM yesterday. Those who did not arrive in Shanghai in time are also scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow and will take the Shanghai Maru back to Japan on the 23rd. Therefore, the ships sailing to Japan these days have been fully booked by Japanese nationals.</p>

<h3>Food Preparation Issues During Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>Soybean and Rice Industries Hold a Joint Meeting. Dalian and Andong Absolutely Prohibited from Loading and Shipping</p>
<p>The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association and the Oil Cake and Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members at the Cuixiu Hall in the Old City God Temple at 3 PM yesterday to discuss food preparation issues during extraordinary times. Gu Xinyi chaired the meeting, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. There were also important resolutions. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Convening a Joint Meeting of Two Industries</p>
<p>The association, in view of the increasingly tense situation and the extreme importance of food during this extraordinary period, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce specially convened Gu Xinyi, a leader in the food industry, to discuss everything. In order to ensure practical progress, Gu and others convened a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members of the Soybean and Rice Industry Association and the Oil Cake and Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association at the Cuixiu Hall at 3 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Sufficient Grain Reserves Ensure People's Food Supply</p>
<p>According to the association's report, the Shanghai grain market is currently very abundant. There are currently about 130,000 bags of Ke Xin rice and about 160,000 dan of He Xia rice, totaling about 300,000 dan. More than 1 million bags of wheat have been ordered from various producing areas, and more than 1.5 million bags are stored in various factories. There are more than 800,000 bags of flour stored. Therefore, it is enough to provide food for the city for several months. In addition to the stored rice and wheat, there are still continuous shipments from the mainland to Shanghai, and the new rice will soon be on the market. The water supply has been even this year, and the harvest is sure to be good. Therefore, in the future, there will be no panic about the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Liaison and Cooperation to Deal with the Incident</p>
<p>The meeting discussed that if the incident expands, all grain merchants in the city should follow the government's will to prevent panic about food. Therefore, preparations for food during extraordinary times began last month. Decisions were made on how grain merchants should seek practical liaison and cooperation and how to facilitate transportation and sales. Starting today, the transportation of grain along the Yangtze River should no longer be entrusted to a certain Fang Han ship to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Strictly Abide by Association Regulations to Prevent Aiding the Enemy</p>
<p>One of the most tense scenes in the meeting was preventing grain from aiding the enemy. The opinions were summarized that domestic transportation should be facilitated so that areas lacking rice and grain can be supplied at any time. However, all transactions should be carried out with caution and must have proof from official agencies or groups. Loading and shipping should be absolutely prohibited to places such as Dalian, Andong, Yingkou, and Qinhuangdao. All grain merchants in the city should strictly abide by the association's regulations and should not be greedy for petty profits. They should also strictly check for unscrupulous elements transporting grain to aid the enemy.</p>
<p>Organize a Commission for Investigating Arrival and Sales</p>
<p>The meeting also decided to organize a commission for investigating the arrival and sales of grain and appointed Chen Shide, Jiang Hongbin, Cai Yukun, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Chen Ziyi, Wang Tianchou, Zhou Zhizhen, Yu Bingwen, He Xianggu, Fu Qiangeng, Feng Yongsheng, and Zhu Xiangsheng, and designated Chen Ziyi as the convener to investigate the situation of grain in the city at any time.</p>

<h3>Students Studying in Japan Request Negotiations to Release Arrested Students</h3>
<p>And to Guarantee Their Safety. More Students Return Home Yesterday</p>

A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency specially went to the ship to inquire.

<h3>Ma Yinliang and Others Scheduled to Go to Europe and America for Inspection</h3>
<p>Wenxi Paper Company Actively Proceeding</p>
<p>Since the establishment of Wenxi Paper Company, the factory construction plan has been actively underway. The factory site has been determined to be Wenxi, Yongjia County, with a designated base of about 400 mu, including mountainous land. The county government is being asked to assist with land purchase procedures, which should be completed within this month. Once the construction drawings are approved by the board of directors, construction can begin. As for paper-making machinery, it is very difficult to purchase domestically, so it has been decided to send Director Ma Yinliang, General Manager Chen Shizhang, and Deputy Manager Jin Han abroad for investigation. They are scheduled to take the Empress of Japan steamer to America on the 8th of next month, then transfer to Europe for a trip of about four months. They will incidentally investigate the paper-making industry in Europe to learn from their experience. As for the power for the factory, it has been decided to use electricity, with self-provided motor generators. The motor generators will be purchased in Shanghai. The transportation problem of the company's products in the future has also been studied, and it has been decided to prepare their own ships to save on shipping costs.</p>

<h3>Young Boss of Zhenhua Silk Factory Accused of Extortion</h3>
<p>Arrested in a Brothel on Shantou Road Last Night - Judge Orders Rescheduling, Sun Liangfu Released in Court</p>
<p>Sun Liangfu, a native of Ningbo and the young boss of Qinyi Silk Factory and Zhenhua Silk Factory on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, is 22 years old. Recently, Zhu Wenqing, the young boss of Zhu Hongsheng Wood Shop at 53 Taiwan Road, accused Sun at the Old Zhabei Police Station of extortion. Detective Feng Xiushan arrested Sun at 11:45 pm last night at the Yaqiu brothel on Shantou Road, took him to the police station, and escorted him to the First Criminal Court of the Special First District Court this morning. Sun Liangfu hired lawyer Jiang Chiping to defend him in court. Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court questioned him. The police station lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the plaintiff in this case, Zhu Wenqing, had married Qiu Youdi four years ago. However, in February of this year, she suddenly ran away. Later, the Zhu family received a warning letter from lawyer Sun Bawu, representing Qiu. Zhu Wenqing and Zhu Juping also hired lawyer Jin Yu to negotiate with her. Eventually, they agreed to negotiate at 9 pm on May 3 in room 502 of the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road. On Zhu Wenqing's side, Zhu Juping, his wife Zhu Lin, Zhu's friend Chen Ziyu, and Jin Yu were present. On Qiu's side, Sun Liangfu and Sun Bawu, among others, were present. During the negotiations, Sun Liangfu demanded that Chen Ziyu first hand over 1,000 yuan before negotiations could proceed. Chen only agreed to pay 400 yuan, but Sun insisted on at least 800 yuan, resulting in a breakdown of the negotiations. Later, Zhu Qiu and her mother Qiu Zhang went to the police station to accuse Zhu Wenqing of assault. However, after examination, it was found that she had only suffered minor injuries to her arm, so the case was not accepted. However, after investigation, it was learned that Sun was the instigator, so he was pursued. However, Sun's whereabouts were uncertain, so he was not arrested until yesterday. The police station is now prosecuting him for attempted extortion under Article 346 of the Criminal Code. Zhu Juping added that there were also fire brigade personnel and people in yellow uniforms in the room at the time. Sun Liangfu confessed that Qiu Youdi's biological father, Shi Agen, was originally a partner in his factory and had a very good relationship with him. After Shi died, his wife remarried Qiu Xingcun. In April of this year, Qiu Youdi and her mother cried at his house, saying that Youdi was being abused by her husband and asked for help. He then hired the factory's legal counsel, lawyer Sun, to handle the matter. The Yangtze Hotel was found by the plaintiff's side. At that time, Xu Sanlang, the former police chief of the local court, also came with his two apprentices. The amount of 400 yuan was also proposed by them and rejected by him. Judge Qian then ordered the case to be rescheduled for one week and Sun Liangfu was released.</p>
<h3>Security Regiment Seizes Smuggled Scrap Iron</h3>
<p>24 Bundles of Scrap Iron Confiscated on the Spot - Bought by Foremen and Transported to Foreign Ships</p>
<p>Zhang Changsong, a member of the Special Affairs Department of the South Shanghai Security Regiment, seized Wang Liyou, a 30-year-old Anhui native, at the Jiangbian Wharf on Bansongyuan Road, South Shanghai, at 2 pm yesterday for smuggling scrap iron. Twenty-four bundles of scrap iron were confiscated on the spot and handed over to the police station. According to the confession, Wang was working as a coolie on a ship at the South Wharf. The scrap iron was hired by two foremen to be transported by boat, specializing in transporting purchases from the Jiangbian Wharf to foreign ships. The case involves the export of prohibited scrap iron and will be submitted to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>Murder Case of Xuan Sheng Needs Further Investigation</h3>
<p>Defendant Examined for Scars - Court Orders Rescheduling for Further Hearing</p>
<p>In the case of the murder of Xuan Sheng Kuangzuo, a Japanese resident, the former Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng and transferred them to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation and prosecution. They were sentenced to death and imprisonment for murder and endangering public safety, respectively. Mao and others refused to accept the sentence and hired Yu Chengxiu, the lawyer appointed by the first instance, to file an appeal. After repeated trials by the Jiangsu High Court, they were all ordered to reopen the debate. On the morning of the 17th of this month, the hearing was held again. Mao and others still insisted that they had been tortured when they were arrested. The presiding judge ordered the inspection officer to examine them and confirmed that there were indeed scars. The court ordered them to wait for investigation before further trial. Because this matter involves a serious foreign-related case, and the High Court has reopened the debate twice, which is extremely cautious, the reporter visited lawyer Yu Chengxiu a few days ago to inquire about everything. According to Yu, the reasons for the appeal are detailed in the appeal document. At the hearing on the 17th, the judge first announced that Zhu Guisheng was ill and ruled that he should be released on bail. However, he was sent to the hospital for treatment without bail and died. Then, the appellants Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng were interrogated. According to Mao and others, they were tortured after they were arrested and insisted on being examined for scars. The judge then ordered the inspection officer to examine Mao Yonghu, Wang Zhensheng, Jin Daoquan, Chen Enming, and others separately. Mao and others immediately demonstrated the situation of being tortured. As a result, it was found that Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng both had scars on their hands and feet. Jin Daoquan and Chen Enming were considered to have been too long ago, and there were no obvious traces to be found. Yu then defended the facts of the case based on their statements. He also said that Jin Daoquan was very thin and coughed frequently, and he was afraid that he also had lung disease, and requested the court to send him to the Institute of Forensic Medicine for identification if necessary. The court ordered further investigation and trial. In short, the court is handling this case with extreme caution. Although he is handling it on a voluntary basis, he is also very inspired. However, the report a few days ago stated that he declared in court that the fact that the original handling agency used torture to extract confessions was clear, which is somewhat misleading.</p>
<h3>Little Anhui Sentenced to Seven Months for Stealing a Myna and Extortion</h3>

He then threatened Shen and extorted 10 yuan in legal tender. After the incident, the Yangshupu Police Station sent detectives to arrest Little Anhui, who was escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This morning, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the Third Criminal Court, questioned the defendant Chen, and sentenced him to seven months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3>Korean Traffickers in Narcotics Arrested, Along with Addicts and Traffickers</h3>
<p>Traitors Zheng Youda, Yao Caijia, etc. - Specialize in Trafficking Narcotics for Korean Rogues</p>
<p>The Old North Gate Police Station broke up a gang of traitors, including Zheng Youda and Yao Caijia, at Jianfen Lane at 6 pm yesterday. They specialize in trafficking morphine noodles and other narcotics for Korean rogues, poisoning China. Earlier, the police station patrol officer led a special patrol to the lane and saw two women with haggard faces, knowing that they were white noodle addicts. He searched them and found three small bags of morphine. When asked where they bought it, they said it was from a certain number in the lane. The patrol officer, fearing exposure, returned to the station and went in disguise. Zheng Yao and others, who were selling morphine, arrived to deliver the goods and were immediately arrested, and ten bags were found. When asked where they came from, they said that there were accomplices on the road. The patrol officer immediately led them to arrest them, and a total of eight addicts and traffickers were arrested. They are currently being interrogated at the station to determine the facts and will be sent to the bureau for strict handling.</p>
<h3>Jiufeng Silk Factory Sells Short Raw Silk, Dachang Requests Seizure</h3>
<p>Workers Demand Work and Payment of Outstanding Wages - Association Asks Landlord to Pay Wages as Usual</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Jiufeng Silk Factory in Zhabei sold short 600 dan of forward raw silk due to stock exchange trading, causing a dispute. Dachang Foreign Firm provided a guarantee of 80,000 yuan and applied to the First Special District Local Court to seize all the factory's machinery, along with about 30,000 yuan worth of dry cocoon inventory. The factory should have resumed work on the 15th in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. However, after the factory owner, Huang Fulin, had his machinery and inventory seized, he was unable to raise funds, resulting in his inability to resume work as scheduled. The factory employs about 1,000 female workers, who have been coming to the factory in batches to make noise, demanding the payment of outstanding wages and requesting a speedy resumption of work to maintain their livelihoods. They also approached the Sixth District Silk Reeling Industry Trade Union for consultation. After the trade union consulted with the silk factory trade association representing the owners, the trade association stated that, according to the usual practice of silk factories, the landlord should be responsible for compensating for unpaid wages. It has been found that the factory is the property of Wuxi Jinglun Company. The trade association has sent personnel to Wuxi to find the person in charge of the company and ordered them to pay the wages within one week. As for the resumption of the factory, the factory has been completely sealed, and the factory owner is unable to cope. This is a matter of fact, and the trade association cannot help. It has told the workers to wait for the court to resolve the matter.</p>

They immediately went to the Old North Gate Police Station to arrest Feng and confiscated 500 yuan of the stolen money. He also confessed that Wang Guizhen, an accomplice at 77 Dajing Road, was also arrested. After being brought back, it was learned that Dong Shungen, the nephew of Fuketai and Sewing Shop, was tempted by the bandit gang and agreed to divide the stolen money, giving Dong 1,500 yuan. Unexpectedly, after the robbery, Dong only received 20 yuan. Dong has also been arrested. However, after interrogation, it was found that a large portion of the stolen money was still in the hands of an accomplice surnamed Ye. Widespread arrests have been unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Fishing Boat Sinks in Waters off Daji Mountain After Being Hit</h3>

<p>Liu Baoxing, a native of Fengwei Township, Fujian, owned a large fishing boat and hired Captain Chen Paozuo and crew members Chen Shiqi, Chen Shengjiulin, and others to fish at sea. At 11:30 pm on the 17th of this month, the boat was docked near Daji Mountain when an unidentified ship suddenly crashed into the fishing boat, breaking it in half. Chen and the four others held onto the stern section of the boat and drifted for twelve hours. At noon on the 18th, the British Post Office's giant ship, Sondan, traveling from Shanghai to Japan, passed by and the crew members shouted for help. A small boat was lowered from the ship and rescued all four. However, after being battered by the wind and waves for a long time, their faces were pale. The crew members changed them into dry clothes and planned to take them to Japan, then find a way to send them back. In the middle of the journey, another giant ship of the same company, Ranohi, returning from Japan to Shanghai, raised a flag to signal it to stop and transferred the four to that ship, bringing them back to Shanghai. After arriving in port yesterday morning and docking between the 12th and 13th buoys of Yangshupu, they reported it to the Customs Water Police Station. Detectives Shen Changshan and Shi Axin boarded the ship and took the four crew members back to the police station. They had all changed into the work clothes of the ship's crew. It was learned that the ship had drifted away and disappeared, with losses amounting to several thousand gold.

<p>Zhao Bingyi, a Suzhou native who used to work as a servant, is now unemployed and lives in a bungalow in Wufuli near the intersection of Avenue Haig and Gordon Road in the Public Concession. His wife, Zhang, was unable to have children, so she spent money to buy a six-month-old boy from a woman in Jiangbei to raise as her son. He is now thirteen years old and named Yongfa, and is studying in the fifth grade at Weide Elementary School on Xinzha Road. After the holidays on the 1st of this month, Yongfa went to school as usual. He went out at 7:30 am on the 7th and did not return home until 6 pm. Zhang became suspicious and went to the school to inquire, only to find out that the child had not been to school. She reprimanded him slightly and sent him to his aunt's house to be disciplined. Unexpectedly, Yongfa suddenly ran away alone at 2 am on the 17th. He got lost in the territory of the Third District Office of Qingpu on the afternoon of the same day. The district office took him in and sent a letter to the newspapers in this port to find his family. After reading the newspaper, Zhang went to Qingpu eagerly to claim her son. She took the Qinghu Ningkang small steamer back to Shanghai. The ship arrived at the mouth of the Suzhou River in the Pujiang River at dusk the day before yesterday. Yongfa went to the stern of the ship on the pretext of urinating and jumped into the river, committing suicide. It was too late to save him, and he immediately sank and disappeared.

<p>Chen Wenkui, a native of Jiangbei who lives at 51 Boxiang Village, Route de Pères, French Concession, and his wife, Lu, are both nearly fifty years old and have a daughter. Since they were young and blind, they had no way to make a living. Therefore, Chen and his wife had her study astrology from a young age. After she became proficient, she used it to make a living. She went out every day to seek food. Zheng Bujin, a blind man from Jieyang in the same industry, often met Zheng's daughter. Over time, they fell in love, and the two blind lovers began to live together, going out early and returning late every day to make a living. Their feelings were harmonious. Unexpectedly, Chen's heart was like a willow catkin, and she gradually became disgusted with Zheng. She secretly had an affair with another blind man named Yang Quan'gui and became increasingly cold to Zheng. Zheng soon discovered Chen's actions and sued Yang Quan'gui and Chen in the Criminal Court of the Nanshi Local Court for obstructing his family. The trial ended and the defendants were detained for two weeks and released. Chen was still taken back by Zheng to live with him. Recently, when Zheng accompanied his wife Chen to visit her parents, Chen left on the pretext of going to get a haircut and never returned. It has been many days since there has been any news. Zheng Bujin believes that his in-laws are intentionally hiding her, so he filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court, accusing his in-laws Chen Wenkui and Chen Lu of obstructing his family and requesting an investigation. He also attached a civil lawsuit, requesting a judgment ordering them to hand over the person. The court, based on the complaint, summoned the defendants to the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning by Judge Sun Pengham. First, the plaintiff stated the intention of the lawsuit. The defendant Chen Lu was the only one who appeared in court and stated that the plaintiff and her daughter were living together but were not formally married. She also did not know about her daughter's departure. The court recorded the confession and ordered an investigation, rescheduling the trial for another day.</p>

<p>Qian Yinsheng, who opened a small teahouse in a mud-walled enclosure in Pudong, on the 24th day of the first month of last year, due to a dispute among tea patrons regarding "eating jiang cha" (settling disputes through mediation), had a conflict with Yang Yusheng, the owner of an iron shop. Yang fired a gun as a warning, but the stray bullet accidentally hit Zhang Jinhai, a barber, who died from his injuries. This case was delayed until this spring. Yang Yusheng was arrested and sent to the District Court for trial. Yang testified that he knew nothing about the incident and suspected that someone else was responsible. The case was then suspended. Yesterday, Qian Yinsheng was summoned by Judge Wang and testified that at the time, because some tea patrons were "eating jiang cha", he refused to let them do so in his teahouse, and he did not know Yang Yusheng at all. Yang was entrusted by someone to make trouble for him. When he tried to leave, Yang fired one shot into the sky and one shot into the ground, and he immediately fled into the room. He did not know how Zhang Jinhai died, but according to his wife, Yang Yusheng's third shot hit him. His own injury was not caused by Yang Yusheng but by Song Quansheng. The judge asked if he recognized Yang Yusheng now, and he replied that he did. The judge then ordered Yang to sit among the crowd and had Qian identify him. However, Yang Yusheng consistently denied it. The judge, believing that there were still doubts in the case that needed to be investigated, ordered a postponement and instructed Qian Yinsheng not to leave Shanghai within fifteen days.</p>
<h3>Xu Xueqing Sued for False Accusation, Sentenced to 20 Days of Detention</h3>
<p>Suspended for Two Years, Remainder Not Guilty</p>
<p>Zeng Weiren (aka Guangcai), a Hunan native working as a clerk at the Jianghai Customs, previously took Xu Xueqing (17 years old this year), a woman from Chongqing, Sichuan, as his concubine when he was working at the Chongqing Customs. Later, Zeng was transferred to Shanghai. Xu, finding it inconvenient to travel such a long distance, remained in Chongqing. However, after Zeng left Sichuan, there was no communication with Xu. In the early winter of last year, Xu, being pregnant, came to Shanghai to find Zeng. After meeting, Zeng sent her to a hospital to give birth and provided her with funds to return home. However, Xu came to Shanghai again, demanding lifelong alimony from Zeng, but the case was not accepted by the Special Second Court because it did not meet the proper procedures. Zeng then hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit against Xu Xueqing and her mother, Xu Wu, in the Special Second Court, accusing them of false accusation and fraud. He claimed that they had already separated in Sichuan, with a payment of 700 yuan, and after she came to Shanghai last year to give birth, he gave her another 500 yuan. After signing a separation agreement at the lawyer's office, she falsely accused him of fraud and requested an investigation. Judge Sun Pengxian held two hearings and announced the conclusion, awaiting sentencing. The details were recorded in this newspaper yesterday morning. Judge Sun came to the Second Criminal Court and sentenced Xu Xueqing to 20 days of detention, suspended for two years. The remaining charges were dismissed. The judge explained the meaning of the verdict, stating that there was a question of marriage and abandonment between the plaintiff and the defendant, leading to the case of marriage alimony. This cannot be considered as accepting money. However, the defendant's disturbance can only be considered as a minor offense, hence the sentence of detention.</p>
<h3>The Weather in Shanghai Returns to Hot, Hurricane Originates in the Pacific Ocean</h3>
<p>Originating Near Guam Island; Currently Still Far Away</p>
<p>The weather yesterday turned hot again, with the temperature rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit at noon. The sun blazed all day, and the heat was severe. The number of epidemic patients has increased again. In Shanghai, in addition to cases of pseudo-cholera, there have been no confirmed cases of true cholera so far. The situation across the country is also stable. According to the Observatory, a hurricane has recently formed near Guam Island (YAP) in the Pacific Ocean and is currently moving northwest by west. It will soon pass over Luzon Island. At present, it is still far from Shanghai, so the wind force is unclear, but if the direction does not change, the southeastern coast of China may be affected.</p>
<h3>Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>(Thirty-two)</p>
<p>(Question) A letter from Zha Gongying in Nanjing states that he came to Nanjing from the interior of Zhejiang, but due to the hurried schedule, he did not have time to bring his cotton quilt. If he buys a new one in Nanjing, he would not use the old one, which is quite wasteful.</p>
<p>(Answer) It can be sent as a postal parcel. The prescribed procedures should be followed: pack it into a parcel, and clearly write the names and addresses of the sender and recipient on the package. Bring it to the nearest post office, and ask for a detailed domestic parcel delivery form to fill out. Submit it together for delivery. The weight of domestic parcels must not exceed 30 kilograms (60 *jin*), and the dimensions, length, width, and thickness, must not exceed one meter and twenty-five centimeters on any side. The volume must not exceed one hundred and twenty cubic decimeters. Items exceeding these limits will not be accepted for delivery. For other important matters, please refer to Q&amp;A in Issue 30 of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Parcels sent from various places in Zhejiang Province to Nanjing are charged at a rate of 20 cents for the first kilogram and an additional 10 cents for each additional kilogram or fraction thereof. (According to the parcel charging standard, the unit is kilograms; fractions less than one kilogram are calculated as one kilogram). The shipping weight of a cotton quilt should be around four kilograms, costing approximately 50 cents in postage. As for the transportation situation, unless there are special circumstances, items are generally shipped as soon as they arrive, and there are no delays en route. Parcels sent from the western part of Zhejiang to Beijing take approximately five days to arrive, while those from the eastern parts of Zhejiang take four days.</p>
<p>(Question) Someone is researching the transportation of local products in various regions and needs to consult the transportation routes in various places. I heard that the postal map published by the post office contains quite a lot of information. What is the name of that map, where can it be purchased, and how much does it cost?</p>
<p>(Answer) The maps published by the post office are divided into two types: 1. Postal District Map; 2. China Post Map. The Postal District Map is a single sheet map, one for each postal district, 107 cm long and 146 cm wide. The local postal management bureaus and first-class post offices in each district, as well as several larger postal management bureaus such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin, and Beiping, all sell them (for example, if you want to purchase the Henan Postal District Map in Nanjing, you can purchase it from the Jiangsu Postal Management Bureau in Xiaguan). The price is one national currency yuan per sheet. The China Post Map is bound into a book, 52.5 cm long and 28.5 cm wide, and was published in the winter of last year (this is the fourth edition). It contains a general map of the entire country, 30 divisional maps of various provinces, and inserts of the provincial capitals and major urban areas of each province. The price is fixed at ten national currency yuan per book. Postal management bureaus and first-class post offices in other places all sell them. If you want to purchase them in places other than management bureaus or first-class post offices, you can ask the second- or third-class post offices in those places to handle it for you. In addition, the Directorate General of Posts recently compiled a book entitled "A Record of Products in Areas with Postal Service in China," which contains detailed information on the products, prices, and production seasons of places with postal service throughout the country, and can be used as a reference. The book is sold at the Commercial Press in various locations, and the price is fixed at twelve national currency yuan per book.</p>

<h3>Valuable Academic Research Material</h3>
<p>"German Academic Research in the Past Fifty Years", compiled and translated by the Sino-German Cultural Association in Beiping. The first volume has recently been published by the Commercial Press. This book is not only a valuable advance in the translation of German books, but also a valuable resource for those concerned with academic research in Germany. Dr. Shulitze, president of the Sino-German Cultural Association, said that the compilation and translation of this book was initiated by Chinese members of the Translation Committee of the Association, and the translators have been working on it for three years. The book is divided into four volumes, the first of which has been published, and the second, third, and fourth volumes are currently in print and will be available soon. He also stated “The publication of this book has aroused great interest among Chinese friends, which is fortunate. Personally, I also have the feeling that after the whole book is complete, it will be of great help to the Chinese in understanding Germany and to Germany in understanding China."</p>

<h3>Brief Biographies</h3>
<p>Words of Chairman Chiang: The gradual revival of the Chinese nation and the progressive improvement of its international status clearly demonstrate the achievements of Chairman Chiang. As for his morality, it is clearly reflected in his daily words and deeds and in his handwritten "Diary of Two Weeks in Xi'an," which manifests his great personality. There is no need for us to elaborate further.</p>
<p>In the club of our Jiangsu Student Training Corps, there are two calligraphies of Chairman Chiang's instructions to us: "Four Essentials for Soldiers" and "Record of Self-Reflection." Here, they are recorded to share with readers:</p>
<p>Four Essentials for Soldiers:</p>
<p>Be worthy of the fallen soldiers,</p>
<p>Be worthy of the spirit of the late Premier,</p>
<p>Be worthy of the parents who gave me life,</p>
<p>Be worthy of the suffering masses.</p>
<p>Record of Self-Reflection:</p>
<p>Have I been loyal to the Doctrine?</p>
<p>Have I been responsible to the Party and the Nation?</p>
<p>Have I had faith in the Commander-in-Chief?</p>
<p>Have I been obedient to my superiors?</p>
<p>Have I been trusting of my subordinates?</p>
<p>Have I been confident in myself?</p>
<p>— (Zhou Junyuan)</p>
<h3>Liu San of Jiangnan</h3>
<p>— Qingquan</p>
<p>Liu San, a native of Minhang, Shanghai, is a progressive member of the Min Party. Thirty years ago, he was friends with Zhang Taiyan, Zhang Ji of Gaoyang, Zhang Xingyan of Hunan, and Zou Rong of Sichuan. At that time, Zou was the youngest, only nineteen years old, and he wrote a small book called "The Revolutionary Army," signing himself as "The Revolutionary Army's Vanguard Soldier." In fact, Taiyan encouraged him to do so, and Xingyan wrote the title of the book. When the *Subao* case was brought to court, Zou and Taiyan had no choice but to go to prison. Before the year was out, Zou died in prison.</p>
<p>Liu San, whose original name was Jiping, was an old member of the Nanshe Society. His poems and prose were admired throughout the country. Knowing that Weidan (Zou Rong's *zi*, or style name) had sacrificed himself for the country and had no place to be buried, he donated several acres of fertile land in the western suburbs of Shanghai as a burial ground. The person who managed the matter was Xu Jingwu, a native of Ningbo, who made a living by selling books under the Sihai Shengping Teahouse. Those who did not know him called him "King of Fake Chickens," but he was truly an old revolutionary who promoted revolution. As time passed and times changed, Jingwu passed away, and the tomb of the so-called Weidan was unknown. Liu San enjoyed drinking and was skilled in poetry. He went by the name "Liu San of Jiangnan" and composed a couplet which was inscribed at the beginning of a long scroll. The couplet reads "Why learn from the mournful poets, cultivating orchids and planting herbs to record beauty? I should mourn the spring and two winds, thirty-three days of dreams and fallen flowers", "Fang Weng is dead, and the recluse immortal is gone, cutting paper and recalling the unbroken soul. I only fear the flowers will freeze to the bone, so I will not refuse the spring wine to warm you." Reading this, one can imagine what kind of person he was. But ever since he took the post of Supervisor, it has been difficult to see his figure.</p>
<h3>Miss He Aiying, Female Tennis Player</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Every year during the tennis season, we often see news in the sports section of the newspaper about Miss He Aiying, a female tennis player living abroad, participating in competitions and winning victories. Although Chinese people have never appreciated her tennis skills, she is very well-known in overseas tennis circles.</p>
<p>She is only a sixteen-year-old girl this year. When she was twelve years old, she had already made a name for herself in the tennis world, winning the junior girls' championship. Since then, she has participated in various junior girls' competitions in Britain and France every year, and has often won victories, earning the deep attention of men and women tennis players, who believe that she is the future of women's tennis. The domestic newspapers also often carry news about her competition victories. Therefore, Miss He's fame is deeply imprinted in the minds of every Chinese person who pays attention to tennis, and on the one hand, we are also fortunate that China has such a female tennis player who is famous overseas.</p>
<p>Last year, she had the ambition to participate in the annual Wimbledon World Tennis Championships. However, the British Tennis Association stipulates that male and female tennis players under the age of sixteen are not allowed to participate in Wimbledon competitions. If there were no such age restrictions, then Miss He's participation in the Wimbledon Championships would have been no problem. Because many of the adult female players participating in the competition do not have skills superior to her, and some are even inferior to her.</p>
<p>This year, she is sixteen years old, so her desire to participate in the Wimbledon Tennis Championships has been fulfilled as she wished. She is the youngest of the ninety-seven female players participating in this year's competition. Moreover, due to her small stature, she looks like a twelve- or thirteen-year-old. Her first opponent was Ms. O'Connor, a British female tennis player. After two sets of fierce battles, Miss He lost by a score of six to eight and four to six. Looking at this score, one can see how intense the competition was at that time. Although Miss He was eliminated, the audience and the next day's London newspapers expressed sympathy for the little girl and warmly praised her. Her biggest disadvantage is that she is not tall enough, and another weakness is her backhand. In any case, her future is limitless, and perhaps in three or two years, she will occupy an important position in the world tennis scene.</p>
<p>However, in this Wimbledon Championships, her name is marked with the words "Great Britain." According to the British newspaper's explanation, her parents are Chinese, but she has become a citizen of Great Britain. Here, we hope that the authorities of the Chinese Sports Federation will find a way to solve her nationality issue first. It cannot but be said to be a little funny for a pure Chinese person with black hair and a yellow face to represent Britain on the tennis court!</p>
<h3>Yu Hongjun Works Diligently Day and Night</h3>
<p>— Yujiang</p>
<p>The modern Mayor of Shanghai, Mr. Yu Hongjun, is handsome, capable, and has served as the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government for many years. He is trusted by successive mayors, who all know that Yu has participated in municipal affairs for a long time and has rich experience, and they rely on him as an indispensable helper. Before serving as Secretary-General, Yu served as Military Advisor to the Municipal Government for many years, and once served as Acting Director of the Finance Bureau, organizing the municipal treasury, which was quite successful. People in Shanghai should still remember this. According to a friend in the Municipal Government, both former Mayors Zhang and Wu were also members of the Central Executive Committee. After finishing their official duties at 4:00 PM every day, they could leave the government and return home to relax. However, Yu himself, due to his responsibilities, had countless documents that he had to personally review one by one. Even when the government staff had scattered, he would still be working at his desk, sometimes until late at night. It was already commendable that the two former Mayors Zhang and Wu carried out their duties punctually, but it was even more commendable that Acting Mayor Yu had such a spirit of working, so it was no accident that the Central Government ordered him to act as Mayor of the Municipal Government this time.</p>
<h3>Xu Shaodi Sings the Party Song Loudly</h3>
<p>In May, the third music concert was held by middle schools in the capital of Zhejiang Province. Xu Shaodi, Director of the Department of Education, attended and delivered a speech. Xu is known for his eloquence, and his speeches are well-organized and captivating. In this speech, Xu specifically cited the effects of his own two times of singing the Party Song loudly, proving the significance of music in education, which was particularly interesting. He said, "It must be known that music has great significance in education, as it can cultivate temperament and invigorate the spirit. Now, based on my personal experiences, I will provide factual proof: I have been participating in the Scout Conference in Wuxing for several days, and I felt quite tired. Yesterday, I returned to Hangzhou and passed through Mount Mogan. I tried to climb the mountain along a rugged path, and at first, I felt quite difficult. So, I started to sing the Party Song loudly, and I immediately felt invigorated and my energy doubled, and I finally reached the top of the mountain. Also, this morning, when I returned to the city from Jianggan, I saw elementary school students running around arbitrarily, and they did not respond when I called out to them. So, I loudly sang the Party Song, and they gathered around upon hearing the song. Then, I taught them the meaning of the New Life Movement and obeying order, and they were all able to understand. Such is the ability of music to move people. I hope you will train diligently to cultivate your personal body and mind, and to promote the national spirit." It is noted that Xu also serves as a member of the Provincial Party Committee in Zhejiang, so his words take into account the Party, education, and the New Life Movement, and although this is a small matter, the wording can be said to be appropriate.</p>

<h3>A Record of Strongman Wang Ziping</h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with the world of Chinese martial arts must have at least a certain impression of the strongman Wang Ziping. I remember more than ten years ago, when a Russian strongman came to Shanghai to find someone to compete with him, he was a huge sensation, and no one dared to compete with him. As a result, he was defeated by this Strongman Wang, and he relieved us of a breath of frustration and brought back our prestige.</p>
<p>I also remember once when Strongman Wang went to Japan, he met a famous Japanese strongman on the ship who wanted to compete with him. At that time, it was the hot and steamy summer, so everyone was wearing only light clothing. Strongman Wang deliberately wanted to make fun of him, so he frowned and said to him with an idea in mind: "I only need to use a small finger to make you fall!" As soon as he said this, everyone on the ship was a little horrified! Everyone gathered around to see the strength of the two strongmen, especially to see how this Chinese strongman would knock down this famous Japanese strongman with a small finger. However, at this moment, no sooner said than done, I only saw this Strongman Wang moving his posture and immediately walking in front of the Japanese strongman, using his fingernail on his little finger to tickle the Japanese strongman's belly button, causing the Japanese strongman to laugh and fall to the ground. Then, Strongman Wang said to everyone on the ship in public: "How is it? Didn't I knock him down with a small finger? If I used my fist, wouldn't I smash him into pulp?" This incident caused a sensation on the whole ship and was passed on as a good story. Although the strongman used some small cleverness to trouble the Japanese strongman, it was after all a matter of face for our Chinese nation. Now, Strongman Wang has retired. In addition to teaching the skills of Chinese martial arts to several proud disciples, it is said that he also opened a trauma hospital in Xiaoximen, specializing in doing things that benefit the world and benefit people.</p>
<h3>Words of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Letian</p>
<p>General Miaga, commander of the Spanish government forces, had some magnificent words in his letter to the soldiers on the front line that could serve as a lesson for us. Here, I have changed the tone and offer it to all compatriots in the country: "...Soldiers and civilians, you are heroes of freedom and independence. Now, let the whole world know that the inhumane troops of neighboring countries who are jumping around in our territory will be annihilated by our army. We swear to defeat the invaders and make them shatter to pieces and be completely annihilated. We must ensure that the Republic of China does not become the second Abyssinia, and after the invaders are defeated and retreat, we must establish a free and powerful New China!"</p>
<h3>A Record of Dr. Zheng Fuhua's Creation of the Capital Ferry</h3>
<p>— Ailment Escaped</p>
<p>In the past, when traveling from Shanghai to Ping, upon arriving at Xiaguan, one had to disembark from the train and board a boat to cross the river, braving wind, frost, and turbulent waves. Adding to the difficulty was the need to assist the young and old and transport luggage, which was a great hardship for travelers. Now, one can comfortably sleep in the train carriage and cross the river in a sweet dream. Whom should we thank for this? It is Dr. Zheng, the subject of this article, who single-handedly managed the entire process from proposal to design and construction to completion.</p>
<p>When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it recognized the inconvenience caused by the Yangtze River hindering the through train service between Ping and Shanghai. Consequently, it hired Mr. Huatai'er, an American authority on bridge engineering, for a cost of 40,000 yuan to come to China. After extensively surveying various locations including the Beijing-Hankou, Hangzhou-Shanghai lines, he drafted proposals for bridges along each line. Many in the domestic engineering community were awed by his reputation and followed his lead. However, Mr. Zheng alone opposed his proposals, firmly advocating for ferries. He eventually completed the project himself, at a cost of just over two million yuan. The Qiantang River Railway Bridge, which is currently under construction, is estimated to cost 40 million yuan. Based on this comparison, building a bridge between Xiaguan and Pukou would cost at least 100 million yuan, dozens of times the cost of building a ferry. Therefore, Mr. Zheng once jokingly told a friend that the annual interest earned from the construction funds saved by building the ferry could purchase a new ferry each year. The annual painting and repair costs could cover the ferry's operating expenses. Given the country's poverty, how can such waste be justified? With such a large sum of money, one could build 1,000 kilometers of railway, which would be far superior. He also said that if the Qiantang River Bridge were replaced by a ferry, it would be absolutely safe to operate, and the tidal waves would have no impact. He predicted that the Wuhan Bridge, which is currently being planned, might eventually be replaced by a ferry because it would be difficult to raise the huge funds required and there would be no guarantee of profits.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Zheng is the supreme leader in bridge design and planning in our country. The reinforcement of the entire bridge standard on the Jiaoji Railway, and the replacement of bridges on the Tianjin-Pukou and Beining Railways, were all his work. He also served as the head of the design department of the Ministry of Railways for eight years, overseeing the planning of railway bridges nationwide. His firm advocacy for ferries was truly for the sake of saving national resources, preferring to bury his long-honed skills rather than flaunt them.</p>
<p>In the spring of this year, a friend traveled to Huangshan and met Mr. Zheng in Xuancheng, southern Anhui. He was then serving in the Jingqu Railway Bureau, dressed in plain clothes with a dark complexion, just as he had been when teaching at Tangshan Jiaotong University. The friend arrived at the bureau at about 11 o'clock. A card was immediately sent in, and he was invited to the office. They shook hands and reminisced about the old days. Mr. Zheng introduced a middle-aged engineer, saying that this gentleman was there to discuss a bridge design and asked the friend to sit down for a while. He then turned back to the drawing table and continued to explore the design, drawing lines and making calculations with great concentration. After more than an hour, they were still discussing it endlessly. The engineer frequently glanced at the guest, but Mr. Zheng did not notice. The guest's stomach was rumbling with hunger, but he did not feel comfortable leaving. After waiting for another while, the matter was finally concluded. Mr. Zheng then said to his friend, "I'm sorry to have made you sit here bored. It will soon be noon, let's have lunch together and chat." Hearing this, the guest could not help but smile. He looked at his watch and it was already 1:10. Mr. Zheng then rang the bell to order food. After the meal, the guest did not dare to stay any longer and needed to return to the hotel. The next day, the friend went to She County. The engineer, informed by Mr. Zheng, greeted him on the road. He was also a former student of the friend at Tangshan School. During their conversation, he said that Director Zheng's excellent scholarship and diligence were well known, but unfortunately, he was still like a professor in the past, often doing things that were out of touch with reality. He also paid excessive attention to moral integrity, and even if he heard something, whether true or false, he would make a big fuss, which was quite embarrassing. He seemed quite resentful as he spoke. The friend advised him, "The Doctor is old, but as stubborn as ever. As times change, those who are opportunistic and smooth-tongued are being replaced, while those who are loyal, honest, and sincere can accomplish something. Mr. Zheng's future may surpass Zhan Tianyou. One should be more understanding of his minor eccentricities in dealing with the world." He then told him about waiting while hungry, which made the engineer smile and become happy.</p>
<p>The author first met Mr. Zheng ten years ago. He had just returned from abroad and invited me to a tea party, where he showed a film of American bridge construction procedures on the screen. The way he pointed with his fingers and spoke with such fascination and focus is still vivid in my mind. Hearing my friend's words, I wrote this down in a disorganized manner to introduce to the nation this technician who buries himself in his work and rarely receives praise.

<h3>Strengthening Our National Foundation</h3>
<p>— Huamin</p>
<p>If a country wants to be prosperous and strong, it must consolidate its national foundation.</p>
<p>Promoting hygiene and advocating for domestic goods are the main conditions for consolidating the national foundation.</p>
<p>Soap, which removes dirt and grime, is indispensable for a clean and hygienic life.</p>
<p>Among the domestic soap manufacturers, Wuzhou Gubenzhao Pharmaceutical Factory is the most diligent. Its products include: Gubenzhao Soap, Gubenzhao Perfumed Soap, Gubenzhao Medicated Soap, Gubenzhao Soap Flakes, and other varieties. All of these can meet the needs of society and can be said to be honorable contributions among domestic goods.</p>
<p>We should all consistently purchase "Guben" brand soaps for washing clothes and bathing our bodies. This will not only achieve the goals of "promoting hygiene" and "advocating domestic goods," but also strengthen our national foundation.</p>
<h3>Swapping the Phoenix in Its Nest</h3>
<p>Chapter Sixteen (News Inquires in the Southern City; Yun Window Tells of Dreams; Romantic Resignation at the Banquet; Return of the Carriage on the Brothel Lane)</p>
<p>Youmei said: It happened last night. Guoqi was originally sitting down. Then he clapped his thighs with both hands at the same time, stood up, and exclaimed, "That's right!" Youmei said: Did you see him leave the house? How can you say "That's right?" Guoqi laughed: Of course I have evidence. But in my heart, I'm certain it's true. But saying it out loud seems childish. Youmei said, "I don't understand what you mean." Guoqi looked at the shadows of the trees outside the window. He pondered for a while. Then he smiled and said: Although it's broad daylight, I'm going to tell you a dream. I got drunk last night and had a dream all night long. The most wonderful part of the dream was seeing you and him walking together. His two feet were chained together, and he could hardly take a step. Fortunately, you held his hand and helped him walk step by step. Youmei supported her chin with her hands, nodded repeatedly, and said "Oh" twice. She smiled and asked, "Then, where were you helping him walk to?" Guo smiled: That's right, you should ask that question. Otherwise, there would be no value in this dream. You were helping him walk on a mountain path. At first glance, the mountain didn't seem very high, but after looking at it for a long time, the mountain layers receded into the distance, pushing the mountain peak to hide in the clouds. Later, I only saw one person. Walking faintly on the ridge, it was no longer two people. Youmei said: Only one person left. Who is this person? Can you see clearly? Guoqi listened to her words but did not answer. He raised his head and looked out the window at the sky. He saw that the small tree under the eaves was still trembling, shaking the sparse leaves that were about to fall off. It seemed like the spirit of the person walking on the mountain peak in the dream. He nodded in the air and said: How beautiful, how noble, and how great. Youmei heard him praise repeatedly, but she didn't know who he was praising. However, in the current situation, there was only one woman here. If he wasn't praising himself, who else would he be praising? She couldn't help but blush and lower her head. Guoqi finished imagining this fantasy, and Youmei turned her head. Seeing that Youmei was sitting diagonally across from her, feeling a little embarrassed, he smiled and said: Miss Li, do you understand what I'm saying? She then looked at him, snorted in her nose, nodded, and said: I'm not very stupid after all. I can probably understand what my cousin is saying. But when it comes to studying, I'm not as good as my cousin. If my cousin speaks like he's writing an article, then I wouldn't understand. As she said this, she smiled slightly. Her long eyelashes surrounded her eyes, and her dark eyes were rolling around inside her eyelashes. Then she lowered her head again. Guoqi pretended not to notice her intentions. Seeing that two red blushes had appeared on her cheeks, as if she were a little shy, he smiled and said: Do I speak with an essay-like tone? I didn't realize that. Which of my words has the meaning of an essay? (199)</p>

<p>It has been more than ten days since the Japanese army launched an unprovoked attack on the Lugouqiao and Wanping areas in western Beijing on July 8th. Looking at the recent situation, on the one hand, the Japanese army is continuously attacking our army and rapidly importing large numbers of reinforcements from outside the pass, showing signs of a large-scale offensive war. On the other hand, there are so-called peace negotiations being held in Tianjin and other places. We sincerely doubt what the so-called "peace negotiations" currently underway in the North are about?</p>
<p>We want to clearly point out here: Under the pressure of Japanese imperialism's cannons, even the minimum peace negotiations are absolutely impossible to establish, unless the Chinese side gives the enemy some concessions! The central authorities have repeatedly stated that the negotiations in North China are not a local matter, and any agreement must be approved by the central government before it takes effect. On the other hand, the figures conducting peace negotiations with the Japanese side in North China have also stated that they will seek peace under the condition of not losing rights and humiliating the country. In fact, these statements do not guarantee that the outcome of the Lugouqiao Incident will not be something like the "He-Umezu Agreement." Because we know from the lessons of the past that every negotiation with the enemy has resulted in humiliation. Furthermore, saying that these negotiations will not accept any humiliating conditions, I dare to point out in advance: this is absolutely impossible!</p>
<p>Therefore, we advocate: The current negotiations should be stopped immediately. If it is necessary to negotiate for the sake of the overall situation, we only have one thing to say to the enemy: Quickly withdraw your troops - there is no room for discussion. Because we will never forget the words of our great leader Chairman Chiang: "If the enemy invades one more inch of our land, it will be the last moment of our sacrifice"! Now the Japanese army is freely rampaging in the Pingxi area, and the area invaded is not just one inch of land, but several square miles! Therefore, now is the time when the "last sacrifice" has arrived, without a doubt. Because our only request is to resist the war immediately! Mr. Wang Jingwei said: We are "resisting Japan" not "rejecting Japan," then here we want to shout: The whole country unites to resist Japan! This is the time for the whole nation to fight the enemy!</p>
<p>We respectfully and firmly demand from the government: Immediately order the termination of all peace negotiations in North China, because this is undoubtedly humiliating to the country; immediately transfer a large army to the north and inform the people that patriotism is not a crime and allow the existence of all national salvation organizations.</p>
<p>Secondly, what we the people must immediately do on our own: Raise donations and provide comfort, organize anti-enemy mass organizations, support the government's strong foreign policy, and boycott enemy goods, etc.</p>
<p>The situation is critical, a matter of life and death, the Lugouqiao Incident is likely to be followed by the fall of the entire North China! To defend North China, and to seek a line of survival for the Chinese nation, then resisting the enemy and saving the country has now reached the final moment! We enthusiastically support the government in leading the 450 million hot-blooded people to engage in a desperate struggle with the enemy!</p>
<h3>"July 8th" in Beiping</h3>
<p>— Zhifu</p>
<p>A Conversation with a Returning Southerner</p>
<p>Although it had already rained heavily, and although a cool evening breeze had risen in the sky, making people feel much more comfortable, the small room was crowded with the four of us, so the temperature inside still didn't seem to have decreased at all.</p>
<p>I was waving my fan, and the sweat on my forehead was still dripping down my cheeks. But the returning southerner's conversation didn't lower his voice because of the heat. He spoke passionately, and a few times I almost raised my arms like him. I was too moved.</p>
<p>However, I calmed down each time. In order to hear the rest of his conversation, my two friends also remained quiet and didn't cough. Finally, he continued: -</p>
<p>"Friends! Ever since the ** people seized our Manchuria, Beiping and Tianjin have not only become their ideal territories, but they have also long had the ambition to seize the entire North China! ... In the past, didn't they provoke our garrison several times in Fengtai over some trivial matters? But they were greatly disappointed that the play didn't develop into that scene several times. ... But are they really disappointed, friends? ... No, they will never easily give up their ambition to invade. ... Therefore, friends! We have long expected that the incident in Tianjin and Tianjin is absolutely unavoidable...</p>
<p>"... Friends! But in the present time, as long as they are not traitors, every people who don't want to be slaves to the nation, who is willing to let the ** people come in again? You think.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>... especially our loyal officers and soldiers of the Twenty-ninth Army, when they came to disturb us on the night of July 8th, they raised their guns and rushed towards our greatest enemy. ...</p>
<p>"But, friends! ... The night when the cannons sounded on the Lugouqiao Bridge, the residents of Beiping city were all terrified! However, friends! - In order to strengthen the determination of the people in the rear to resist *, in the heart of Beiping, which was closed the city gate, we began to do what we should do! ...</p>
<p>"Friends! Our only way out now is to go to the front line and resist the war, friends! We must shout out the slogan 'strike back against those who strike us'! ... On the streets and in the alleys, we talked to the beloved people like this. - And the people are happy to listen to our words. ...</p>
<p>"A few times we were simply extremely happy:</p>
<p>"Friends! I tell you: The first day we set out was in a famous hutong in Xizhimen. But it is now very deserted here! We used the power of copper bells to gather more than ten nearby residents: Then we began to report on the war situation in the Ping suburbs, and the several knowledge that the people in the rear should have ... They were moved! I saw someone in the crowd rubbing their fists and shouting: "Kill ** people", "We want to survive and die with Tianjin!" ... the slogan. Friends! Our people are not numb after all!</p>
<p>"Then, the propagandists who were traveling with us began to sing tragic national salvation songs: -</p>
<p>"Arise, those who do not want to be slaves! Put our flesh and blood...'"</p>
<p>"The thick voices and the thin voices ... combined into a powerful chorus, painting the air of the entire hutong with a kind of solemnity and tension ... Friends! Who among these people is willing to be slaves to the nation? ...</p>
<p>"However, the singing alarmed the police on the street. - The police came. He shouted loudly to stop us:</p>
<p>"'You are not allowed to make such a fuss!'"</p>
<p>"'We love our country, are we not allowed to?'"</p>
<p>"'You are not allowed to sing loudly'"</p>
<p>"'We must sing, oppressing patriots is also a traitor!'"</p>
<p>"'Traitors, get out of here ...'"</p>
<p>"'........'" The police finally turned red in the face, but quietly retreated.</p>
<p>"Friends! We are really happy! - Unlike the things of last year, they would take water dragons and wooden sticks to abuse us, you think, the police now also forgive our enthusiasm, we are too grateful to him!</p>
<p>"However, my friends! Since I was forced back to the South by my environment, the events in Pingjiao have continued to this day. I believe that this ancient and noisy city of Beiping will soon burst out with bright sparks, let us young people who are unwilling to be slaves to the nation! ...</p>
<h3>The Victory of the Ants</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>After dinner, everyone sat in the courtyard to enjoy the cool air, which was the most comfortable time in summer. Slowly eating the remaining melons and fruits from the day, the so-called floating melons and sinking plums, had its own kind of pleasure. Morning glories climbed on the flower wall, blooming with one or two white small flowers. Not knowing what flew over, the small kitten that was lying at my feet suddenly pounced on the flower wall in a predatory manner, but it gained nothing, returned in disappointment, and washed its face with its front legs. The crystal clear moon had already risen above the corner of the roof.</p>
<p>The youngest child squatted at the foot of the flower wall, seeming to be listening to something. He liked crickets the most, perhaps he was digging for treasure there again. The older brother seemed to have discovered the secret too, and quietly snuck up behind him and covered his eyes. This unexpected attack made him scream, but he immediately knew that it was his brother's prank, did not pull away his brother's palm, and shouted:</p>
<p>"Brother, look!"</p>
<p>At the foot of the flower wall, a battle was unfolding, a mantis was being besieged by a group of ants. The mantis appeared very brave and was waving its double knives, the ants rolled east and west like small balls, but a few were desperately biting its wings, making it unable to quickly break through the encirclement, and more and more ants were gathering.</p>
<p>The sky was already very dark, and the moonlight was blocked by the lush branches and leaves of the morning glories, occasionally when the wind blew and shook, it filtered down moving circles of light, the verdant mantis was surrounded by a group of wriggling small animals, it was really a beautiful picture.</p>
<p>The older brother also waited patiently to watch. They gradually squatted a little closer, like scientists in a chemical laboratory examining their new inventions. The younger brother even used a small grass stem to guide the ants from the nest directly to the front line, while preventing the mantis from killing the enemy. Watching its double knives gradually unable to wave, and the ants on its body were getting more and more, like a chicken that couldn't swim falling into a small river, struggling desperately and finally unable to move.</p>
<p>The ants naturally won the final victory. The brothers cheered happily, because they felt a kind of spiritual joy. When everyone gathered at the foot of the flower wall to watch, borrowing the moonlight, they saw a small black mountain slowly moving along the base of the wall.</p>
<p>"Perhaps these ants are singing a song of triumph?" I thought.</p>
<p>When I returned to the house, when the brothers were studying under the lamp, I asked them what was the reason why such small ants could defeat a mantis.</p>
<p>"That is the power of unity!" they answered together.</p>
<p>"Only unity can survive!" The battle between ants and mantises was indeed a very old-fashioned fable, but every fable can give us a very good lesson.</p>
<h3>A Song of Bitter Rain</h3>
<p>— Changji</p>
<p>A group of people, including the porters, totaling fifteen, set off for Ankang County despite the rain. The five pairs of straw sandals made a squeaking sound as they walked! Splashing mud and water all over their bodies. Especially the porters, who were carrying heavy luggage on their shoulders, landed much heavier than the empty-handed guests, and the mud and water splashed even higher. At this time, everyone had filled their bellies and were walking with a burst of energy, unlike the exhaustion they felt when they arrived at the inn yesterday. However, everyone cursed the mischievous sky in unison, as the incessant drizzle had not stopped for several days. The already dilapidated and winding mountain path was now even more slippery and difficult to walk on. Everyone carefully stepped steadily, winding and turning one stretch after another.</p>
<p>What made this group of people feel the most difficult was crossing one ditch after another. A torrent rushing straight down from the mountain flowed rapidly through everyone's toes, invisibly hindering the speed of progress. If you stepped on the moss on the stones, you would definitely fall to your death in the ditch. Everyone's faces and hair were like they had just been soaked in water, wet and dripping, and it was hard to tell whether it was sweat or rainwater.</p>
<p>"Why are there so many ditches? How many more days will it take to get there!" one of the guests complained to himself, seeming unaccustomed to such a dangerous road.</p>
<p>"Boss, more than half the road is done. If it clears up right away, then we'll be in Ankang County in two more days."</p>
<p>An old porter with a slightly hunched back, showing his few remaining yellow teeth, comforted the complaining guest with this very experienced remark.</p>
<p>"Brother Ma, it's really hard on you this time. Unfortunately, the weather is bad, and we're on the road in this rainy season; not to mention that it's difficult for you to walk carrying such heavy things, even we who are walking empty-handed are really tired."</p>
<p>"As long as there are no accidents on the road and we arrive safely, Boss, we are very happy even if we are a little more tired!"</p>
<p>"I hope so, let's have an early rest stop today!"</p>
<p>"No, we must cross the Shandaogou Ditch today before we can rest, that is a dangerous ditch! I'm afraid that even the ferry won't dare to cross such a large flood. Let's hurry up and try to figure out a way!"</p>
<p>Everyone felt that Brother Ma's words were correct, so they mustered their spirits to hurry on. When they arrived at the Shandaogou Ditch, the sky became even darker, and a roaring waterfall flowed in the ditch, splashing water onto the shore. At this time, even shouting at the top of your lungs could not find a trace of a ferry, and everyone's hearts could not help but become anxious.</p>
<p>"What should we do? Brother Ma!"</p>
<p>"Can't we stay here overnight? Brother Ma!"</p>
<p>Everyone asked the old and experienced Brother Ma these questions, forcing him to look helpless and not know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>"Don't panic! It was said that even the ferry wouldn't dare to cross such a large flood, now let me go and look for one!"</p>
<p>He searched for a small wooden boat in several ditches. The boat was also hidden in this secluded place because it didn't dare to risk it. He couldn't resist Brother Ma's pleading and agreed to take them across the ditch. This made Brother Ma's face light up with joy, and he shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"The boat is here, everyone, come and get on the boat!"</p>
<p>More than a dozen people hurriedly rushed onto the boat, but the very small boat body was a bit heavy and couldn't bear it. After a violent shock, the boatman braced himself and pushed the bamboo pole, leaving the embankment and rushing into the turbulent waves; everyone was carrying a feeling of danger tied to this drifting wasteland of misty rain.</p>

<h3>A Reply to Mr. Bu Hui Baixiang</h3>
<p>— Lao Baixiang</p>
<p>The other day, I was in high spirits and wrote a playful letter to a friend as a joke. Unexpectedly, before I even received a reply, a Cheng Yaojin jumped out from the side, with a burly build and eyes like copper bells, wielding an eighteen-foot spear, ready to join the battle. I couldn’t help but be shocked. Upon closer inspection, I realized it was also an old friend of over a decade, which put my mind at ease.</p>
<p>Speaking of the words "Lao Baixiang" (Old Playboy), I feel quite ashamed. In my life, I've never been good at "baixiang" (playing around, being frivolous), and being an "old" one is even more undeserved. However, I am now of an age where I have some experience, neither too significant nor insignificant, so regarding the art of living in the world, if I may be so bold, I do have a considerable understanding. In the past, I had a terrible temper and would always mess with anyone, and I always had to do things my own way, no matter what. But now that I'm getting older, I've encountered plenty of obstacles and learned that this path is completely unworkable in the world. Talking about the art of living in such a way is simply going backward.</p>
<p>So, I sought out an old master. Do you all know his name? Mentioning it really makes him appear impressive. His surname is Li, and his given name is Dan, and it is said that he was even our Taixiansheng (Great Ancestor), the teacher of our first sage and master, Zha Lao Fuzi (Lao Tzu). His art of living was extremely profound. The key to his art of living was the six characters: "He qi guang, tong qi chen" (harmonize with its light, assimilate with its dust). I studied these two doctrines for nearly thirty or forty years before daring to make them public. That's why my temper has changed now, drastically so. I am a "hutiao" (nonsensical, fooling around) advocate.</p>
<p>How did I change? The origin of the name "Lao Baixiang" lies here. The ancients impersonated sages and virtuous men; how dare I impersonate a Baixiang? Sages and virtuous men can be impersonated, but an old Baixiang can never be impersonated. If one were to impersonate, one would surely reveal one's true colors. But I have spent decades studying the ability to harmonize with the light and assimilate with the dust, and it is here that I display my skills. The meaning of the four characters "harmonize with the light and assimilate with the dust," when interpreted using modern sociological terminology, is simply "hutiao." Because of "hutiao," the title of "Lao Baixiang" was placed upon me as high as a coronation for the King of England.</p>
<p>But my appetite is truly excellent. I never get angry and am determined to refuse nothing. If people call me a horse, I will answer that I am a horse; if people call me an ox, I will answer that I am an ox. If people call me Lao Baixiang, I naturally accept it with reverence. In fact, it's truly a wrongful injustice. I originally wanted to hire a famous lawyer to sue at the International Court of Justice in The Hague for the crime of slander under article 19,999 of the criminal law. But after feeling around in my pocket and finding nothing, this idea was abandoned. Moreover, if I were to file a lawsuit, I would inevitably ruin the secret of "hutiao" that I have spent decades forging, which would also be a pity. Therefore, the thought of litigation has fled to Guazhu country. I unapologetically consider myself an old Baixiang. Actually, I have many nicknames, such as "Old Fox" and "Old Sly," which are all my famous names, but these other nicknames do not have the honor of the two words "Lao Baixiang."</p>
<p>However, this friend who doesn't know how to "baixiang," I know that he is a truly genuine, unadulterated old Baixiang. Dogs need to "baixiang," birds need to "baixiang," goldfish need to "baixiang," and flowers and trees are even his specialty, also needing to "baixiang." The friend who doesn't know how to "baixiang" happens to be good at it, while the famous old Baixiang happens not to know how to "baixiang." There is nothing more unfair in the world than this. The reason why the world is not easily peaceful lies in this.</p>
<p>The friend who doesn't know how to "baixiang," I know that he is very emotional. Since he unfortunately encountered "xiaogu" (minor accidents) after "xiaogu," horizontally "xiaogu," vertically "xiaogu," sitting he sees "xiaogu," walking he sees "xiaogu," in the room he sees "xiaogu," in the garden he also sees "xiaogu," touched by objects he recalls memories, constantly reciting about "xiaogu." Now seeing the Lugouqiao Incident, he is again enraged, wanting to follow behind the machine guns and cannons to kill towards Lugouqiao and fight the enemy to the death. Even if he were to sleep with the martyred heroes, it would be nothing. How heroic, how valiant! It can be seen that a person rich in emotions will always be emotionally affected. With deep affection, he still wants to drag the old Baixiang to Lugouqiao to "baixiang" amidst a flood of tears. This patriotic enthusiasm is truly admirable to the point of complete submission.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, my thoughts of negativity have reached 2,800 degrees below freezing point. Not only do I not ask about world affairs, but I also don't ask about family and personal matters. The houses in my hometown have been in disrepair for years, and the gate is especially damaged. As a result, stray dogs have been invading one after another. I absolutely do not want to resist the stray dogs, nor do I want to make things difficult for them. My thoughts of negativity have finally reached their extreme. I don't even keep family matters in mind, let alone Lugouqiao, which is thousands of miles away. What does it have to do with me? But now, hearing the friend who doesn't know how to "baixiang" say such things, I can't help but have my dying embers reignite and heat up, even hotter than white heat, willing to go to Lugouqiao with the friend who doesn't know how to "baixiang" to taste the bullets and shells. Please, everyone, rise up together.</p>
<p>The books that I used to read, I have returned them to the teacher untouched. Especially poetry and songs, I have never learned them. The friend who doesn't know how to "baixiang" brought out many rigid poems and soft lyrics to make fun of me, which is simply playing the lute to a cow, winking at a blind man – equally ineffective. I only know a saying: "I would rather argue with a Suzhou person than talk to a Ningbo person," because the tone of Suzhou people is very soft. Not to mention chatting with them, it's very pleasant to listen to. Even arguing with them is very interesting. The friend who doesn't know how to "baixiang" has lived in Suzhou for a long time, and I know that he must be softened into a state of confusion. Who knew that he would sometimes be harder than a Ningbo person, truly coming from outside the belly. Recently, the weather has been so hot that it makes the wax-headed devil's fire blaze. I don't have the energy to write any further. Please everyone eat less and eat more pickles. I reply briefly, wishing you all peace.
