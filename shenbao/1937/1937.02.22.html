<p>［東京］朝新聞及日日新聞兩報，今晨以順着地位、刊載林內閣將改變對華政策之消息、前者指出日本之對華政策將轉向促進兩國人民之接觸、後者預料日本將暫時放棄政治要求、朝日新聞所載惟息之要旨如下、林內閣因鑒於以前談判之陷入僵局、乃由於堅持解決政治間題為先決條件、故將轉變方針、在促進兩國人民經濟及文化提携方面、從事主要之努力、俾得改善兩國之情感、且經濟與政治之間既有不可分離之聯㯏存在、故日本於一方面進行經濟活動時、仍能同時覓求其他政治問題之解決、蓋政治問題、比較易於解決也、簡言之、林內閣方針二要點、為㊀對華政策、以促進相互提携為主、而先解決經濟文化問題、然後再進行解決政治問題、㊁賡續處理去年談判時、中日政府在苦干點上意見已趨一致之事件，據日新聞消息、林內閣相信現仍無繼續政治談判之可能、該報須謂因此現閣已其決心、完全放棄去歲之談判、至於六項政治要求、包括華北特殊化及聯合防共等將暫予放棄、但關於稅率問題、仍將賡續談判、易言之、林丙閣將停止談判政治問題、而主要在經濟與外交方面集中其努力云、關於林首相昨日在衆議院預算總會席上所予政友會櫻井兵五郎質問之答復、記者感覺此項答復，頗足表示林氏對廣田與有田所持之三原則、認為不適合於目前局勢、並深信切實施行日本對華政策、應以緩和兩國情緒為前提、日新聞之消息、或係根據過於樂觀之揣測、惟朝日新聞之觀察、則比較上與此間存在之確實情形相近、即關於所謂經濟提携一點、此間重要人物亦極力傾向於避免類似政治借款之舉，甯願進行純粹經濟性質之合作、但日本不欲完全放棄賡續關於某種政治問題談判之希望、乃屬自然、縱事實如此、林內對華政策之方向、與廣田有田不同、此點本身亦值得吾人之注意也、日本赴華經濟使節兒玉謙次大約將於下月啟程、至其他日本經濟界、領袖或將以私人資格來華云、（廿一日中央社電）</p>

<h3>到百靈廟去（二）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者錢華</p>
<p>蒙古萬地百餘里無人烟　塞外冰雪前綫將士生活</p>
<p>㊁</p>
<p>打扮得像野熊</p>
<p>記者啟程　北上的時候，真是所謂數九塞天。在極冷的氣節中，跑到極冷的地方去，所以充分預備了御寒衣服。不料行到平津，還是照樣的和暖。一月二十日抵綏遠，雖然比較冷一些，但是在上海穿的衣服，不添一件，還能够支持下去。當地友人就跟我説，百靈廟的天氣可不同了。海派的打扮無論如何不行，否則準得凍出毛病來。凍掉了手指脚指還是小事，記者就連忙趁空買了一頂大狐皮蒙古式帽，一雙長統的“加登科”。加登科是俄語，就是最暖的鹿皮靴之意。鹿皮靴極貴，在綏遠普通所謂加登科，就是全部毡製連底的長統靴，故有恃無恐的在綏遠飯店住了下來，靜候省府調撥車輛。綏省的車輛本極缺乏，近來公式和非公式的視察慰勞團體到綏遠去的又特別多，於是到戰地去的車輛更不够分配。等了三天，省府招待組來通知，請記者跟上海婦女兒童慰問團體一起走。二十三日早晨八時半從綏遠啟程，事先把行李裹面所有的衣服都穿上，真是臃腫不堪，連走路都有些困難。到了指定集合的地點，二十幾位婦女兒童由省府替他們借一身老羊皮大衣，大皮帽，加登科，一個個打扮得像野熊一樣，大家不不禁地狂笑叫來。我們一共有四輛卡車，二輛是有篷的，二輛是敞車，有蓬的當然讓婦女兒童。取得優先權。記者很勇敢的跳上一輛敞蓬車，同車的有百靈廟前綫的大隊長，連排長，和幾位向業。車上堆滿了食物筐子和汽油桶，胡亂的擠着坐了下來。出了綏遠城，我們一路高唱着軍歌，激昂慷慨，熱血在奔流着。朔風凜冽不絕地向面部吹襲，也絲毫不覺得可怕了。一路經過綏戰陣亡將士墓，直撲大陰山，山勢遠望蜿蜓如長蛇，萬分雄壯，車曲折人山，四週岡巒起伏，崎嶇的山路汽車行來，如海舟過風浪，傾側顛箥沒有片刻的平安。蓬車裹的幾位婦女兒童嘔吐狼籍，呻吟的聲音正和車輛的輾動相呼應，車在懸崖削壁間向上爬行，好險峻的所在，敞蓬車上一覽無遺，確有一，千軍萬馬插翅也不能飛過的形勢。走了半小時到達山頂。那是最高的地方，遠遠的幾個山頭都在脚下，汽車在此小停，幾位婦女兒童亦有喘息的機會。但是已經不像人樣了。</p>
<p>㊂</p>
<p>敞蓬車的滋味</p>
<p>這裹的氣候已經與綏遠大不相同。寒風刺骨，拿出照相機來丰都凍僵了。但是還能忍耐，車下坡，速度加大，風勢亦更緊，陰山南北面的寒暖好像隔一個季候，道路工程更險峻崎嶇。行五分鐘，山旁有一石碑，為前西北軍古鴻昌所書的化險為夷四大字。原来開山修路的工程還是西北軍駐綏時候所完成的，永遠留着不可磨滅的功績，這裹就是歷史上著名的蜈蚣壩。所謂壩就是溪澗所成的山徑，這時早已成為阜講，冰雪滿布，是山前山後必經的道路。汽車盤旋出山，山中沿途所見的都是運載貸物的駝馬。慢步行來，上山下山就待一天的功夫，想見昔日交通梗塞時俟的痛苦。上午十一點到武川縣，我們就在此打尖。武川縣長董萬程十分殷勤招待，我們也實在餓得荒了，毫不客氣的大攝一頓。這位董縣長是河北人，從前人住在北平，新近泰省令代理縣職，他是位極圓活着於交際的人，操着一口極流利的北平話，把私人藏着的吃食一古腦兒搬了出來招待遠地旅客，親熱得像兄弟姊妹，盛情實在可感。在坑上桌上擺着的有哈密葡萄乾，天津葡萄，北平餑餑，蘇州瓜子等等，吃不勝吃。疲勞之後，在這裹享福一下，覺得舒服透了。武川縣是綏遠省比較大一些的縣城，全城都是土房，滿目荒涼，充分顯露出地瘠民貧的現象。下午一時繼續出發，行數十里就到了蒙古草原，地勢坦蕩，無所隱蔽。天蒼蒼，野茫茫，極目萬里，一望無垠，清關甯時云：“天如覆釜晴光遠，地似層波去路長”，叉如“躍馬長城外，方知眼界寬”，都是極好的寫實文字。蒙古是一大高原，從多數侵蝕平原和盆地組合而成，海拔約在一千二百公尺以上，偶有邱陵與盆地的變化，但相差也不過二三百公尺且坡度皆甚徐緩（未完）</p>

<h3>俯瞰下的漢川景色</h3>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>四川的周圍環境，都是崇山峻嶺，中央平原寬敝的所謂“川蜀溢地”，幾乎被那些山脈包圍得水洩不通。雖有那婉蜓數千里，受盡千折百磨的長江，向東衝出一條血路，匯湘漢，掠皖蘇，以直遠東洋大海；可是因為它還要經過瞿塘三峽的險阻，這“天府之國”的春光，畢竟洩露不了多少。相反的一切政治經濟文化上的外來影響，也不易惠然而偽入幕之甯，近年中央和地方當局，深感於外迫內發的時勢需要，努力從事交通建設，成績遂突飛猛進，如從南京出發，無論水陸空的交通要具，都可以很迅速地直叩川門，而登堂入室。李太白“蜀道之難難於上青天”的名詩，將成為今後川省交通發達的時代反映詞了。</p>
<p>民用航空綫伸展到四川，中國航空公司較歐亞航空公司為早。當中國初闢航於四川也，頗招地方前當局的疑忌，曾多方設法，極力反對，某將領並揚言説：“如果硬要飛來，就在三峽用高射砲歡迎”！好容易經該公司當局的疎通，得親乘第一機入川面商一切，據説：講什麼公理私誼，都不中用；惟隨身帶去有兩種珍貴的禮物，分贈各方，却發生了意想不到的效力。一種是上海的活蟹，那時正當秋高蟹肥的季節，深居內陸山國的人，竟得一當數千里外來的新鮮而美味的肥蟹，真是高興的了不得。一種是當天出版的申報，平時總要兩星期以後，才能郵到成都，而今忽然由天而降，竟得在當天看到，高興了還有些不自信。於是闢航之約，始順利訂定。可笑是那就約的初稿，是當地留法學生某君所擬的，內有六七條，是抄襲法國與養德等仇國所訂不得互越雷池一步的領空約而來。如此貢獻，若能移用於今日華北輿某國的通航問題，却不失為一有價值的參考資料。但是對於這方而應用，也許又無人肯作如此高明的貢獻了吧？這是記者從西安飛成都的那天，在機中所聽得的趣聞。</p>
<p>從西安飛成都的景物，初越秦嶺（即終南山），支脈縱橫，峯巒峻削。最高峰有達四千五百公尺的，山巔積雪，白光射目，飛機能於其肩峯繞過便罷，否則昂首挺上，凌駕着他的一道道的雪光，祇稍覺仰斜仰斜地便安然飛過。歐亞機最高能飛六千公尺，這樣的高山，飛越自不成問題。秦嶺的北部山脈，多係黑巉巉的石岩，不生着什麼草木；僅千萬丈深陷下去的阱谷裹，葑翳着略帶暗灰色的胄氣。偶爾孕育有幾窟松柏原林，—縱是千百年的老樹，然枝葉疏疏落落的，也藐小到像些水藻。而且因為山勢的錯縱奇突，加以目光的陰陽向背，真是氣象萬千，令人迎接不睱。杜工部詩有“天闚象緯逼，盪胸生層雲”，似乎還不够形容這景象的生動和超遠。假使更凌空而騰上到最高處，俯瞰着勉強攝下一張影片，那恰好是一幅立體模型圖；可惜具體而微，究嬚呆板多了。</p>
<p>再從秦嶺脈的南部，一直跨到巴山山脈的范圍，潮次由少而多，地發現了許多樹林水田和房舍，尤其是無邊無涯的松柏古原林，剛才變換了的大地景色，彷彿脫去僧道樣的緇服黃冠，穿上一什蒼翠欲滴的新裝，是的，這一帶正是陝南山風物，不減江南的漢水流域，這裹林產農作，都非常豐美，還有特產漆和桐油，以及森林梨圍附產的木耳，年銷都各有數十萬元以上，假如終南山的雄奇的山勞，可以把他比做倖丈夫，那麼漢中區的景物，一定可以比做神龍富麗的美女子，同時蜀漢兩域的天然環境，又可併称為姊妹邦，“漢中”既出落得這樣的健美，“四川”當然更生得分外的明媚，不過由航綫上觀察，漢中區的水田，多在羣山疊嶂中，有的是兀然高置於禿頂的山岡上，有的是一級級地圍繞着巋然隆起的大山坡，住屋的方式，雖未曾發現和陝北關中兩區同樣的穴居，然限於山勢地形，多數是到處散居着，“赤匪”曾在那地帶盤踞了好久，國軍無法作傾巢覆卵的圍勦，地形民居，實有以致之，翻過巴山，一到川境，不怕就在三冬季節，那些生意決然的豆麥，森林和竹樹，居然也把本敞的大地，交織成一張寬曠無邊的大綠毯，多數的村舍，也比較是大型的聚屋，然而川省人民的生活，以與在上帝另眼薄待下的陝北民生相較，為什麼還曾發出同樣疾苦的哀嗚，這也是很值得注意的問題，</p>
<p>那一天的飛程，因為悮了起飛的定時，到成都稍遲了一些，可是飛機上裝有覓地定向器，能利用各地廣播及電事定向，縱在雲霧或夜晚中，也能用聽覺或視覺辨別方位，譬如機已悮飛於航錢左方或右方，仰已到站而猶悮飛於前，都可得到下面的無綫電報，迅速而準確地矯正，沿長江飛行的航綫，每年十一月起至次年的三月，因常起大霧，氣候都非常惡劣，有一次從成都飛起的飛機，想往重慶，為雲霧所困，逾時而降，乘客疑已到達目的地，—重慶，抑知定睛審視，却仍在老地方，——成都。這就因為機上尚無定向器，駕駛員不便冒險的原故，</p>
<p>中國航空事業，差幸日見發展，惟大多數的駕駛員，都是借重於外才，未免美中不足，某公司所聘的德駕駛員中，有能按照中國領空測量圖，作處女飛行於任何一地，例如突由長沙飛昆明，或太原飛寧夏等等，無不可按圖索龭，這未免太危險了，在我們的國防意義上講，據説他們還有一張什麼中國航空要圖，由我當局買獲，這真是可喜可懼的事，因為他們既能賣給我們，安知不會翻印以賣於其他外人，叉有一次，某外籍駕駛員，因私携两照相機攝照，曾被宪兵偵獲，把他解約撤职。此事發生後，更滋我人之疑懼，近年當局積極提倡“航空救國”，航空人才漸見輩出，以歐亞為例，中有廣州航校畢業的黃昌厥何啟超陳宏加，和杭州航校出身的林大網等四君，駕駛技術已熟練，而且交部也指令他們參加實際工作，無如外籍駕駛員及航務主任，不肯讓給他們駕駛的機會，僅呌他們做些電務一類的附屬工作，如此大才小用，固為可情，而且在“航空救國”的意義上，也不無“太阿倒持”的危險，新疆環境特殊，溝通歐亞最迅捷的航綫的滬新綫，通而復阻，這不能不説無有原故，公司在此五六年來的營業狀況，各年中載運數字，既有顯著穩定的增長，對於有形無形的旁落的航機，總要設法把它收回才是，纵然有碍於協定合同，在經濟上不免要吃些鈣，然亦應義無反顧，在所不辭也，</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>論美國之司法改革</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>美國的聯邦司法制度的改革案。現在正在熱烈的辯論中。這個法案。與其説是司法改革不如説是政治改革社會改革與經濟改革。因為法案的目的是要最高法院中老朽頑固的法官們退職。用有進步思想同情於政府新政立法的人來代替如果法案通過於國會羅斯福可以任命六個新法官。此後任何新政立法。都不至於受最高法院判為違憲失效的危險。美國的內政革新與社會經濟改善工作可以依照政府的計劃直前邁進了。</p>
<p>原來美國的憲法對於聯邦政府的權限。定得非常的空泛。最高法院因為有解釋憲法的大權。所以政府何事可做何事不可做。都要由他們決定。過去他們曾否認政府施行所得稅為合法。曾判定政府規定最低工資法為違憲。自新政開始以來。美國多少社會經濟立法。如產業復興法。如農業調整法。都是福利工農的政策。而最高法院以為聯邦政府不能干涉私人的產業。農業及工業均非政府所能干涉與管理。先後判定諸法為無效。美國社會經濟秩序。到處需要政府之干涉。而最高法院却處處製肘。這是司法改革案提出的最大原因。</p>
<p>依照美國憲法之規定最高法院的法官。由總統任命。為終身職。現在九位法官之中。除四位對於新政。比較同情外。其餘五位。都是思想陳舊。替資本家們説話的總統沒有免他們職的權。然而國會有增加法官人數之權。在九位法官中。六位已經是七十歲以上的老人了。有的已經達八十一歲的高齡。大部份是七十五歲上下。用這些老人來判斷國家的最嚴重問題。自然是十分危險的。所以改革案中主張。滿七十歲的法官。自動引退。如不辭職。大總統可以任命新法官六人。加入工作。又下級的聯邦法院。當宣判國會的法律是否違意時。要先通知國會。這個提議。是避免司法干涉立法之過度。及使政府得推行其社會經濟政策之自由。稍有進步思想的人。當然是同情的。</p>
<p>但是美國的最高法院。在國民心理中。有極高的威望。美國人崇拜憲法。同時視最高法院為憲法之保護人。羅斯福要他們自動引退。當然會使保守的國民不滿。尤其是共和國政客與華爾街財閥們。不願他們的代言人退出最高司法機關。改革案之通過。尚賴進步主義者之艱苦奢門。這個爭執。可以説是前進思想與落後思想的競爭。美國今後會向那方向去。司法改革案成敗是個明確的指針哩。</p>

<h3>非常時期之廣東糧食（續第二一三期）</h3>
<p>— 丘斌存</p>
<p>粤省糧食不足，誠爲不可掩之事實，而各省糧食，既有盈餘大可供我取用。本人認爲消極的調節糧食，其歩驟有四：</p>
<p>（一）挹注鄰省管理民食：古有「湖廣熟，天下足」之諺，可見其糧食之有餘，本省每年所需糧食，除自産外，不足若干，儘可向湘鄂桂及皖贛糧食過剩省份採進。柱贛皖向有水航可通，運輸原無問題。邇者漢粤通車，湘鄂農産，更使遵陸而至，是我人不啻寓倉庫於鄰省。最近本省政府與人民合作，集資五百萬元，組織民食調節委員會，與中央所設之全國糧食運銷局，相輔爲用，並行不悖，寓管理糧食之意，收調劑糧食之效。其目的係遵照總理所指示：『不取賺錢，而在給養人民』。論及本省民食調節委員會，其重要任務，應有四端：</p>
<p>（一）購買食糧調節暫行辦法第一條規定：「食糧在本國境內，應聽其自由流通，以期供求相劑，漸趨於平」。本省糧食不足，自得擇向皖鄂贛湘桂等食糧有餘省份採進，以利民生。</p>
<p>（二）運輸食糧調節進行辦法第四條規定：「實業部農本局所運調節地方糧食，得以交通鐵道兩部商减各鐵路輪船運費」。本省調節地方糧食，自宜與交鐵兩部商减車輪運費，俾運輸便捷，成本平廉。</p>
<p>（三）儲積：對於一時無有必需消耗或未銷售之食糧，設倉儲積，以免變質。我國古來義倉制度，法本良善，今後如能師其意，於省縣區鄉廣設義倉，社倉，常平倉，經濟力充裕之地，更採用現代真空儲藏法，尤莫善焉。</p>
<p>（四）銷售：調節民食，主旨既不在與民爭利。對於市面需要，盡量供應，平價格，使民不致有米貴如珠之患。人民既不至有鬧米慌之慮，市面籌碼，因以增加，社會經濟，亦得以現調和狀態。</p>
<p>（二）取締偷運遏糧漏海：粤省糧食雖告不足，而爲應海外華僑之嗜好，每年亦有一部份出口。而外國浪人向我各地，大量採購糧食，與本國漢奸，偷運齎寇兵以稻糧者，報章時有揭載，此實爲一矛盾現象。本國各省，固應任由糧食自由流通，而對外則應行取締偷運，防遏偷糧漏海，以禁糧出口爲主眼，以監督出境爲着手，務使狡滑之徒，不能有輾轉偷漏之餘地。</p>
<p>（三）禁止糧價彈性作用：糧食之騰貴，固每由於青黄不接所致，而社會經濟組織之未善，地主糧商，故作糧食恐慌之緊張空氣，囤積居奇，往往使糧價高過於自然增高之程度。最近廣州米價之飛漲，爲廿餘年來所僅見，即可以説明此種超越天然的原因所造成。故對地主糧商之存貨與市價，應予相當之限制，以稍殺其投機謀利之可能性，俾糧價變動之彈性得以减少。</p>
<p>（四）提倡節約限制消耗：在非常時中，提倡節約，有極重大之意義。德國元首希特婁食無牛油，即節約之表現。我人應行仿效，對於一切無益之消耗，均應加以統制。例如以糧食釀酒製糖果糕餅飼養家畜等，無一不應施以取締，以求節省消耗。他如食料之變更，代用品之應用，均結以全部份産銷國米爲最高原則。若在非常時，穀米歉收，國米不敷分配，則自應採購洋米，或塡補倉儲，以資彌補。對於米税方面，不妨稍予减輕，或暫行寄賬辦法。幸也，安南暹羅仰光爲盛産食米之域，素爲我人之食糧外府，大可供我採取，以補不足。惟不應視取糧外府爲常態，而忽自給之謀。須知口袋寄人，究非善計，非至不得已時，以不採此下策爲高也。</p>
<p>四、積極的增進農産</p>
<p>然而消極的調節糧食，究爲一時的，亦即治標的。積極的增進農産，方爲永久的治本的大計。古人謂「民可百年無貨，不可一日或飢」。又諺云「好死不如惡活。」是誠知糧食與養生之重要的至理名言。今欲求積極的增加農産，以足民食，其道何由？本人認爲後論五事，不可不予以深切之注意。</p>
<p>（一）生産統制與農塲合作化：現代經濟社會，已由放任主義，而進於統制主義。要求增加生産，對於生産機構，必要加以統制，與農塲之合作化。就土地言，耕地應如何改變土質，某地應行種植何種作物，又某地應行限制或禁止，栽培何種作物，均屬切要之舉。就勞力言，人自耕田，非常不經濟，若由個人結成一村一鄉爲單位，廢除田塍，集團耕作，不特節省每個農人之勞力，與增加其收入，且提高其生活水凖，使農村日趨組織化，養成其公共心。此種公共心，對於一國之經濟，文化，政治，社會有密切之影響，尤爲其最可寳貴之副産也。</p>
<p>（二）農村金融之灌注：資本與土地勞力三者，同爲生産之三大要素。資金最重要爲流通，而最忌停滯。今日我國金融之病態，適爲資本十九集中於都市，不敢與不能盡量投於工商業，以致富有作用之週轉資金（Revolving　Currency），變成棄置不用之呆欵。而農村則患資本極度貧血症，農人無有母財，一切作業難望進展。今應將都市過乘之金錢，設法灌注到農村中去，使其金融之自然活動，如血液之流通於我人體中。如是則農民購買種籽，農具，肥料等費，既有着落，則自能乘時耕種，與地爭利，而農作物因以豐盛，大量輸入都市求售，易製造商品以歸，工商業亦受其影響而繁榮矣。</p>
<p>（三）農業技術之改良　歐美各國，其農業原較後於我國，然而後來居上，目下其進於電汽化之階段。我國農業，雖來源甚久，而其技術尚盤旋於中古時代拙陋的遺型，亟應加以改良。夫改良農業技術，範疇頗廣。如優良品種之選擇，畜産之改良，馬達水車，汽犁耕種之採川，肥料之變革，蟲害之剷除，經營方法之改觀，與農産之製造等，無不包括在內。</p>
<p>（四）墾荒與整頓沙田　粤省陸地面積，據測量局統計，有六十四萬七千一百七十四萬方里，可耕之農地，占百份之三十至四十五。宜林地占百份之五十至七十。現有田畝總面積四千零六十二萬一千華畝。以每方里折合五百四十畝計，僅占陸地面積百份之十二，其餘非曠野即荒山。我人於此，是知本省糧食之不足，並非由於先天的嗇賦，而人謀不臧，地利未盡，亦其最大的原因，我人苟能倡導一般人民致力於墾荒事業，不特糧食可足，笡有盈餘。兼之墾荒可容納甚多勞力，可予勞工特闢一條出路，間接得以解决失業之社會問題。又本省外沿南海，內貫珠江，沿海沿江，由於自然之變化，與歷史之演進，潮汐漲冲，淤積而成沙田。此種沙田範疇，亦甚廣麥。無論田坦，園田，潮田，桑田，桑基，魚塘，葵，基沙坦，蠔蜆坦等均屬之，加以整頓，對於本省糧食之增加，亦定有莫之助力也。</p>
<p>（五）其他　增加農産，其道非一，前所論列，略示端緒而已。他如設立農業學校，或責各中等學校增設農村師資訓練班，以提高農民之智識，開闢優良穀苗藝繁殖塲，供給農民採取，以增饒生産，勸導農民種植雜糧及經營副業，以增厚其收益，以及改善運輸方法，以减少運銷成本，俾全省四方八面，以同一之價錢，可以購得同樣同量之糧食。並時規定最低最高之標凖價格，爲保護生産者，故定最低價格，方免穀賤傷農；爲保護消費者，故又定最高價格，庶免穀貴傷民。至於省縣鄉村穀倉之普遍設立，亦屬必要之事。（例如廣西省現有二萬三千餘村街，其設倉儲穀者，占二份之一以上，雖每一穀倉儲量，不及二千石，要之可免米價有暴漲之慮矣。）無限制收買與抛銷穀物，如是則可永維米價於平衡。</p>
<p>古人云：「一年種穀」，我人苟循前列軌道以進，則近則一二季，遠則一兩年，廣東糧食問題，可斷其得以完全解决。需求與供給，兩相適應，而本省人民，將不復起食米恐慌矣</p>
<h3>南洋棉布市塲之探討（續第二一二期</h3>
<p>— 高事恒</p>
<p>五·英屬馬來亞</p>
<p>馬來亞人口四百四十萬，以新加坡爲吐納港口。一九三五年施行輸入限制條例，略異於荷印而較公平。其辦法係根據一九二九至一九三三年間各國輸入馬來亞之平均數量，爲一九三五年某國准許輸入之數量（參看第五表）日本爲二千七百萬碼，中國僅一千一百萬碼也。中國輸往者，以染色布較多，在一九三四年爲八百二十萬碼，價值八十六萬元（參看第六第七表），染色布中以土布佔大部份，專供華僑之礦工種植工服用，土人並不採用，馬來亞政府將此項土布列入染色布內，實欠允當，蓋純爲中國手工業製造，與世界紡織業並無衝突，而與中國農村經濟極有關係，在馬來亞消費者又純屬華僑考察團曾根據上述理由致函總督請其取銷此項禁令，迄猶在繼續交涉中也。依現狀觀察，中國貨棉布在馬來亞爲比較有相當地位，容易發展者，惟視吾人努力如何耳。</p>
<p>六、暹羅</p>
<p>暹羅爲南洋唯一獨立國，有華僑二百五十萬，在商業上極占優勢。棉布之輸入，以日本貨佔最大多數（參看第八第九表），一九三五年自日本輸入者凡值九百八十萬銖，自中國輸入者僅一萬九千銖，其相去爲何如。但在香港輸入之數字中，當包括一部分中國貨，惟無可稽考耳。暹羅政府近亦正努力於棉業之發展，謀所以自結，惟暹羅之棉布商集中於曼谷，曼谷之棉布市集中於三聘街，經營斯業者除少數印度人外，皆屬吾華僑胞，國人而有意向暹推銷者，果不患無人效勞，惟自問物質價格較日貨如何耳！</p>
<p>七·從南洋市塲看到吾國棉紡織業之危機</p>
<p>在日本現在正大倡其所謂「支那農業中心論」希望中國永遠成爲日本之農産供應地，據日本每年棉花消費在七億一千萬元自美國購入三億七千萬元，印度，埃及，亦三億萬元，由中國購入二千萬元，最近在華北之棉田作有系統之計劃，而長江一帶原有棉業之市塲，有漸漸落入日商手中之趨勢，中國棉産八百十萬擔（二十五年佔計，）全年消費八百八十萬擔，除自用外，尚倚美印二地棉花之輸入，在日本之意，最好中國專從棉業，供給日本之用。至棉紡織工業，將一手由日本操縱之，觀最近華北五廠，喪失計十九萬三千餘椗，布機一千五百台，均轉售給日廠，因此日廠更擴大規模。增加紗椗布機。大有席捲華北棉業之概，更有一網打盡華商紗廠之勢。中國棉織業，當此生死存亡關頭，應如何力謀團結，共求生存，决不可以各人「自掃門前雪」之故智，而蹈「安而亡危」之覆轍。例如今日農村豐收，每包紗有數十元之利潤，以爲紗廠已大有生路，殊不知中國農村之豐歉，實賴於天時，明年之能否豐收，固不能預料，在「安不亡危」之古訓下，吾人一視民國二十四年度之棉廠，危廹狀態，全國統計開工椗數計四百八十萬椗，而停工有一百三十五萬椗，平均停椗二千一百點鐘，計一年間，總額數停工週數計六二五。在當時棉業界奔走呼號。力謀救濟。今年除華北五廠出售外，上海之棉業家，似尚少有關心整個的將來。吾人從海外歸來，深知别人之用心叵測，華商絶大之危機，尚在未來。吾人以中國棉紡織業，爲吾國民族工業與一切工商業有連繫關係，决不信中國棉業興盛而其他工商業不振，或棉業衰落，而其他工商業仍繁榮者。專就上海一埠而論，據地方恊會之統計年鑑載，上海計有中國工廠一千六百六十六家，計資本一萬萬二千九百四十四萬元，其中紗廠三十一家，佔資本總額四千二百九十四萬元，佔總額四分之一弱，其重要可知矣。而上海日本紗廠之資本計一萬萬六千○四十萬元，龐大之資本，以吾滬全體工廠之資本，尚不能與之相埒，此可知吾國工業之脆弱。若一旦華商紗廠發生動摇，吾國整個工業，將亦不能立足。吾人已知在目下經濟情勢之下，市場轉移，視農村爲轉移，農村歉收，貨物有停滯之虞，農村豐收，則製造品，有求過於供之勢，爲調整此項困難，惟有出口貿易是賴，且爲國家挽回利權，以及南洋六百五十萬僑胞殷殷期望，國貨衣被之蒞臨，吾民族工業之棉紡織家似乎是不能放棄此種職責焉。（本文曾在華商紗廠聯會演講大意現加以增補）（完）</p>

<h3>各地的喫</h3>
<p>— （詳生）</p>
<p>剡谿鯿魚</p>
<p>昔王徽之居山陰，夜雪初霽，月色淸朗，忽憶戴達。時逵在剡谿，便乘小舟訪之，至門又返，曰：乘興而來，興盡而返，何必見戴？讀此一段故事，令人神往不置。剡谿在浙省之嵊邑，爲曹娥江之上游，以訪戴故，亦名戴谿，地多崇山峻嶺，環抱左右，林深箐密，剡谿出於其間，紆回曲折，長百餘里。學弟夏乃疇謂其間有紫石山，或稱指石山，以山麓有石，摻摻若纖指然，又名指日石，則石盡東向，故名。山旁谿水，尤爲甘冽；谿産鯿魚，體扁頭小，細鱗排比，腹部作深藍色，厥光炫眸，肉細嫩似脂，味極鮮美，最宜淸蒸，魚身復加南腿筍片少許，熟後益芳烈可喜，爲之饞涎欲滴，下酒佐飯悉爲上品，偶有紅燒者，然味遠不及淸蒸之美也。此魚以冬日爲最佳，體長尺餘，肉腴飽溢，且一經冰凍，風味逈異，當草白經霜，雲黄欲雪之際，彼地人士，紛紛沽梨花春，啖淸蒸鯿魚，引爲唯一樂事，而遊嵊者亦爭欲一快朶頤也。鯿魚雖到處都有，然無特異之扁形及藍色之鱗，而味亦遠遜，是猶松江之鱸，以四鰓故，而動張翰之歸思也。且此魚有一小小神話，可爲談助：相傳曩有謝閣老者，隱居紫石山畔，性喜食魚，常命僮奴以空炭簍，中置餌物，繫而沉於水中，翌晨起之，必得巨魚一尾，日以爲常。其他漁父，雖張網設罟，未能得也：於是疾惡殊常，潛曳簍起，舉足蹴扁之，以爲巨魚不復得入矣。越宿，僮奴啟簍，則赫然一奇扁之鯿魚，携歸以示閣老，並道簍已被蹴事，閣老莞爾曰：老夫自有口福，豎子其如我何！從此鯿魚遂爲嵊邑之名産，然姑妄言之姑妄聽之而已，不足以爲信史也。</p>
<h3>四川橘子</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>最近，上海的某西報載稱，本星期中，上海到了一船在四川用科學方法栽培的中國橘子，而以後將續有運到，以供市塲之需要。這種科學方法的橘子栽培，是成都的國立四川大學，所試騐的。倘使這個栽培，能完全成功的話，那麽，其結果，或許可替代着每年自外國輸入，價值八十萬元的橘子的地位。此次第一批運滬的四川橘子，在色香味的三方面，幾和舶來的美國橘子，一般無二。兹由中國經濟社，上海分公司，經理而批售於市塲。</p>
<p>這種四川橘子，是用國立四川大學農科試騐塲，把中國的優良橘種養成的苗木，而生長出來的，橘種的栽培，是用科學的方法，而且是很注意的，待橘子成熟之後，一切洗净，分級，以及包裝等手續，完全是採用着現代最新方法的。目前上海的美國橘子的市價，因美國海員罷工之影響，來貨匱乏，每枚已高至二角至三角半左右，所以這種新産的四川橘子，在此時上市，應售，實是一個極好的機會。四川橘子的價格僅比土産的其他橘子，如來自廣東，福建等地的，略略高一些，那便是説，和同樣大小的美國橘子相較，其價值是相差着一半。而這個低廉的價格之中的百分之八十，還是花費在自成都附近的金堂縣，至上海所耗的運費之中的。</p>
<p>查橘子的發源地，大家都知道是華南，和緬甸半島。而現在各地所産的蜜橘，還是一般地被呼爲中國橘子，不過橘子的發源地，雖爲中國，而世界各地的橘種，都是由中國，經印度而傳播開來的。可是在目前，中國却倒反而成了一個外國橘子的主要輸入國了。在去年的十一月，依據國際貿易局，上海分局的統計，共計輸入外國橘子，五○二○○磅，價值一九二八一元。而自正月至十一月間的外國橘子的輸入，共計二一八五八○○磅，價值八三二一二六元之巨。所以用科學方法的橘樹栽培，若能由改良種子，而更逐漸地使生産的橘子，趨於進歩，那麽，中國或將可得杜塞這一個漏巵的優良結果。而本來是處於橘子發源之地的中國，或將重成爲一個高等橘子的重要生産者呢。</p>
<h3>寗波年糕</h3>
<p>— 陳效坎</p>
<p>寗波是浙東最富庶的一個巨縣，在昔年羅惠僑和楊子毅兩氏主政時代也曾經稱過市呢，同時也就是筆者的老鄉。——寗波的一切，雖不能跟東方巴黎的上海嫓美；可是那點高插霄漢巍峨壯麗的新興大建築物和整潔平坦的柏油馬路，却也充分地顯露出現代都市的典型來。</p>
<p>寗波人一年四季中除去正當的交易之外；餘閑的時光，就在「吃」的上面活動着。尤其是在舊歷的年底裏，更是大忙特忙，甚麽年糕呀！糯塊呀！風鷄呀！紥肉呀！……都要在這個時候趕進做好的。而年糕一項，不論是有産階級或是中下社會的家庭裏，多少總得做些或買些應應景的。因之年糕的製法，也就特别來得講究而日益改進了。</p>
<p>寗波年糕潔白細膩，條頭既很匀整；式樣又極美觀，上面還印着各種人物；山水；花卉等等維肖維妙的圖型，的確有些藝術意味，非任何地方出産的所能企及！——把它切成薄片放在鐵鍋子里用猪油；肉絲；青菜；蝦仁和笋片燒至十分鐘左右，即可盛起來吃。至於滋味的雋美適口；耐飢不餓，凡是嗜過寗波年糕的朋友，都有一個很好的印像，嘖嘖稱譽，不消筆者在這兒饒舌！</p>
<h3>中堡醉蟹</h3>
<p>— 陳天賜</p>
<p>在上海，各熱鬧區域的冷盆店裏，都有一種鹹蟹出賣，這些蟹的味道，都是很鮮美，而且價格亦很昻貴，即使小小的一隻，亦得要一二毛錢。</p>
<p>我平素最喜歡吃這種鹹東西，尤其是鹹蟹，更配口胃。所以凡是上海各大冷盆店裏的鹹蟹，都嘗試過，雖然味道頗佳，不過，總没有中堡的醉蟹來得鮮美有回味。</p>
<p>中堡地居興邑最低的區域，故終年河流交錯，如水國一般。南臨吳公湖，北爲大縱湖，因兩湖互相流通的緣故，所以特産有肥碩的蟹，尤多團臍。並且與他處所産的蟹有不同的地方，便是該處的蟹，蟹腿大都肥碩而少腿毛，富有鮮美的蟹黄，因此中堡醉蟹的肥美而出名，全得力於該處所産蟹的優美。當我第一次在中堡嘗到這種醉蟹的時候，我真覺得自己的口福不淺。於是我便問該店堂倌醉蟹的製法，他起初不肯説，後來經我以多給小賬打動他的心，他始把醉蟹的做法告訴我聽，原來醉蟹的製法，先選擇肥大團臍的大蟹，洗滌淸潔，然後把它置在缸內，直須等待它們把腹中的白沫完全吐出，再把它們取出，放入預製的美酒中，這種酒是糯米所釀成，味甘美可口，酒中並攙入茴香，花椒，等等的香料，復和以合度的鹽汁，故鮮美異常。這些乾渴多時的蟹，得到了這甘蜜的酒，傾腹吃個不已，無怪盡都醉死；於是約經過一星期，便可取出供客助餐了。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回（絮語感慈幃懺情殉孝秋光黯翠黛觸景書懷）</p>
<p>經過這一打盆，算是把夢蘭的問話，給牽扯過去了。二少奶端了茶杯，坐在他對面，慢慢的喝着，向他笑道：母親真是一個慈母，這茶葉留在瓷瓶子裏，有好幾個月了，他老人家自己，總捨不得喝一回。只一看到我們高興，立刻就把茶葉拿出來泡茶給我們喝。夢蘭道：母親的確是個慈母。待我們兒女固然是仁慈。就是待兩位少奶奶，也是别家所不容易找到的吧？二少奶微笑着點了兩下頭道：你這話一點也不錯。我回娘家去，家母總對我説，你是前世修的，你的婆母實在是待下人不錯呀。夢蘭兒嫂子這樣誇奬母親，心裏很是高興，把那杯茶喝完了，笑道：我們老喝淸茶，也嫌着口淡，你在我屋子裏多坐一會兒，我去買些點心來，吃着喝着，痛痛快快的談一陣，我也好解解胸頭的煩悶。他只這樣的交代了一句，就聽到門外邊有人答應着道：我到太太屋子裏拿去。交代已畢，那樓梯便是咚咚的響着。二少奶笑道：我們只管説話，倒不知道小菊這孩子在外面藏了大半天。夢蘭歎口氣道：這也是個可憐蟲。人家都説快嘴丫頭，我以爲那是先入爲主的毛病。以爲丫頭説話，總是快嘴。你總也能原諒我，現在我心裏就是這樣，不爲一點兒芝蔴大的事，就要發牢騷。其實我對於那件事倒並没有什麽意見。譬如小菊這孩子，無緣無故的，我就要駡他兩句，駡完了我又要後悔。呵喲，我怎麽拿小菊來打駡方，把話又説錯了。二少奶摇手笑道：我們姑嫂們説話，那裏還留許多心。要是那樣，不顯着太生疏了嗎？我倒覺得你這樣好，心裏有什麽説什麽，全比有話擱在肚子裏强。夢蘭笑道：你覺得我有話放在肚子裏不説出來嗎？我自己倒還不感覺。二少奶笑道：這倒不是我的意思。母親就常常爲件事發愁。夢蘭笑道：母親倒爲我的事發愁嗎？二少奶身子正了一正，把臉上的顔色也沉住了。因道：妹妹，你是不知道，母親和我們談話的時候，常提到你，總説你心裏有話不説，將來會悶出病來。他怎麽會知道呢？因爲他自己就藏了一肚子的病。夢蘭道：我母親藏了一肚子的病嗎？二少奶道：你是在今天才知道嗎？他老人家身上的病，還是不輕。因爲他怕告訴你之後，你心裏難受，所以他始終是瞞着的。（一三五）</p>
<h3>廣東的春節食品</h3>
<p>— 若</p>
<p>一瞬眼間，舊曆的年關過了。筆者草此文時，主婦們正預備好了伊們的花腸，臘肉，而開始購備糯米，油，糖，從事伊們的更煩忙的工作了。</p>
<p>天生了伊們的一雙靈的手，使伊們什麽都會做，而且無論貧富，伊們誰都有做做的勁兒。自己會做的東西，伊們是不很高興去買的。尤其是在鄉間。</p>
<p>現在把它們拉雜地拿些來談談，也許會引起讀者們的興趣吧。</p>
<p>如龍　「如龍」據説是「餘糧」的訛讀，但現在大家都是這麽的叫了。這是春節供神最重要的東西，誰都不能缺少，正和歐洲人聖誕節的火鷄一樣。伊們還認爲它是一種吉利的象徵，除了自己吃外，是不送給别人的。做法很簡單，用糯米粉，黄糖和水在一大盆裏拌成糊狀，再放入內鋪冬葉的箂裏，炊它一天半天便成功了。還不用鹹品或冰糖去做，那是專用來吃的。</p>
<p>碌堆　首先用糯米粉和以濾過的白糖，做成半生熟的，粘性很大的粉團，再用這種粉做成一個個中空的團子，然後放入油鍋裏煮，煮到相當的膨大，便成功所謂「碌堆」了。也有做實心的。這也和「如龍」一樣，被認爲是一件吉祥的東西；要擇黄道吉日去煮，煮時更不許孩子們説壞話。</p>
<p>糖環　這通常是和「碌堆」一起做的。用做「碌堆」的粉拌和以蕃薯，再把它印入木製的模裏，巧妙地輕輕一削，就成了「糖環」的雛型。放在油鍋裏煮好後，鬆脆可口。</p>
<p>炒米餅　先把炒好的粘米磨成細粉，然後拌以黄糖或白糖，做成「炒米糕」，再用這些「炒米糕」在餅模上印成各式各種的餅型，最後把它們拿到臨時用磚搭成的爐上，烤一會就成。這種工作是很麻煩的，但這種麻煩一點也抵不住主婦們的興趣。伊們和鄰居們合在一起，夜以繼日的工作着。蠧蠧之聲，巷閭相聞，很是有趣。</p>
<p>此外如鬆糕，菊花團，鵝腸，粉片，蛀頭等等也是重要的家製食品，不過爲着篇幅關係，只好從略了。</p>
<p>至於在市上買的如冬某，蛋黄餅，杏仁乾糧，米通……真是不勝枚舉，在十字街頭，早已琳琅滿目了。</p>
<h3>蘇州的熟食擔</h3>
<p>— 德鄰</p>
<p>每天在傍晚時候，我公畢回家，因爲我的服務地距離着家裏很近，祇有短短的兩條小巷，還不滿一里的路程。當我工作了一天，精神上感覺到非常的疲倦，回家時，總是慢慢地踱回去的；藉以稍稍運動來恢復一日間的積勞。但是一個人歩行在湫溢的小巷裏，最令人討厭的，要算是往來交織的人力車了；横衝直撞，往往躱避不及，退讓無從，因爲湫溢的小巷，狹到通行了一輛人力車後，便阻塞了交通，再不容第二人可以行走。其次更有「篤篤篤」「搭搭搭」敲了各種聲音的熟食擔，什麽餛飩咧，湯水圓咧，豆腐花咧，沿途都是，鱗次櫛比，在街心歇着，不過他們都歇在一定的地方，比較往來交織的人力車，行路時還没有這樣的令人討厭。</p>
<p>這些的熟食擔，他們各有各的主顧，每天在一定的時間，挑了擔子，向每條小巷裏，在一家家的門前歇着，用竹筒敲出各個不同的聲音來，引誘着自己的主顧，使那些的主顧們，聽到了「篤篤篤」和「搭搭搭」的聲音，便能够辨别出來，這是餛飩擔，那是湯水圓擔，或是豆腐花擔，然後可從屋子裏奔出來購買。</p>
<p>在蘇州的許多小巷裏面，儘多着一般黑漆牆門的富户貴族，他們依舊保持了封建的色彩，婦女是足不出户的。但是有一個共同的習慣是立門口，到了傍晚時候，粉臉朱唇的少婦小姐，竚立在門前張望，這就是那批營熟食擔小販的唯一主顧。他們也同僕役一樣，叫着什麽小姐少奶的稱呼，來博取伊門的歡心，因爲這是一年四季照顧他們生意的長主顧。遇到了伊們有時不到門前來竚立的日子，在屋子裏聽到了「篤篤篤」和「搭搭搭」的聲音，遣着丫頭們來購買，從那丫頭口中的傳達，這是小姐的，那是少奶的，這批營熟食擔的小販，也能够辨别出伊們的個性來，小姐是喜歡鹹的，少奶是喜歡淡的，所以蘇州營熟食擔的小販，個個都口齒伶俐，善於辭令的；並且他們最喜歡停歇湫溢的小巷裏面。</p>

<h3>去年兩湖茶產情形</h3>
<p>產量較增銷數減削　年底尚存四萬餘箱</p>
<p>新新社云、國際貿易局發表云、兩湖紅茶、向為行銷國際之大宗產品、關係地方經濟至鉅、及近年以來、因國際市場被奪、銷額日以減少、市價逐漸低落、已呈一厥不振之勢、據詳細調查，去年一年間、產量雖較前年增加、而銷数則反见减削、知世项唯一出品之紅荼、仍在崩溃之過程中，苟延其殘喘關係</p>
<p>產額方面</p>
<p>云年兩湖紅茶、因受春雨影響遲至六月一日始告登塲、本省較大產區、為宜昌·羊樓峒·聶家市等處、湘省產區較廣、計有安化·桃源·高橋·湘陰·永豐·醴陵·婁底·監田·平江·長籌街·瀏陽·等處總計全年產量為一十八萬八千四百二十五箱、較前年（二十四年）產量一十四萬一千六百五十三箱，則增至四萬六千七百七十二箱、其中以安化產量最豐、藍田次之、至</p>
<p>銷場方面</p>
<p>過去在國際貿易市場、素佔重要地位近年以來、因受外茶傾銷影響日漸減削、去年英倫市場、又為印度·錫蘭·日本·等外荼所剝奪、致國荼外銷、一厥不振、因此本市英商太平·怡和·協記·協和·杜德·天裕·天祥·俄商協助會·德商與诚·德華·等行·進胃均極軟弱、市場交易時断時續、直至年終、復以銀錢兩業、相率結賬、投信緊縮、致市况日落、綜計全年銷量、運同上海·山西·等帮販商及本市各茶行茶店所購進在內、共為一十四萬一千三百八十二箱、截至去年底止、產銷兩抵、尚存四萬七千零四十三箱，尚未售出、</p>
<p>市價方面</p>
<p>當去年新茶開始上市時本市販商·均於期前紛赴產地出莊、爭相訂購、以致產　奇昂、迨至運漢以後、國際貿易市場、基於上述外茶傾銷因素、外商始而徘徊觀望、繼而抑價吸收、般販商咸以無利可獲相率待價不售、旋因棧和月息負累甚重為避免鉅大虧折計、不得已遂貶價脫售、但遭受虧折者已不乏人、如藍田·安化·高橋·桃源·等地販商、在新茶上市時，市價超過五十元、尚不願售、及至年終、雖減售至二十七元、亦無人問津其次羊樓峒·張家市·長籌街·平江·瀏陽等處販商亦略有虧折、僅宜昌販商經售之茶、品質特佳、曾售至九十一元之最高價、各獲相當盈餘、此外茶片子及花香初曾售十餘元、至二十元以上、現花香僅售數元而已·據上所述、去年各地茶商、除宜昌幫略獲盈餘外、餘均遭受虧蝕、</p>

<h3>統一與和平（續)</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>或詐又有人要質問，為什麼外國入可以聯合呢？Uniled　St　ates　of　Americe不是一個聯邦國嗎？不錯，美國是聯邦國，但是，第一，美國的軍隊是否由各州自由統率指揮呢？美國盡管聯邦，而所有的海陸空軍完全由中央聯邦政府統率指揮的。第二，美國的外交是否由各州自己去辦理呢？美國的外交完全由中央聯邦政府負責去辦，决不是這裹山紐約州負責，那裹出來西根州負責，如同我們冀察可以另設一個外交委員會的。總之，美國雖然是聯邦，而外交軍政財政民政諸大權，却仍然集中於中央聯邦政府，所以Uniled　Siates　of　America實實在在是一個統一國。他們許多州，本來是一個個獨立的小州，有了這個組織，這個政府，才把各小州統一起朱，他們才真是用聯邦制來統一了美國。中國怎樣呢？中國本來是置一的國家，為什麼還要硬承認他分成許多單位，然後再來聯合呢？這好比一個人，縱然四肢局部有病，本來可以醫好的，却偏要把地的四肢切斷，再把他們聯接起來，美其名曰聯合，這是聰明的辦法麼？縱算中國也不妨成一個聯邦國，那麼第一，中國這許多省也必須小到像美國各州一樣不能有獨立成國的資格，使地方政府不能獨立稱雄；第二，中國必須先把軍政，財政，民政，外交，敎育這些大權究全集中於中央：然後可免地方割據之弊。但如果做到這樣，則已經成為名副其實的統一了，又何必巧立“聯合”的名目呢？</p>
<p>那麼，以“聯合”求和平究竟是什麼人提倡的？聯合是中國共產黨所假借的名義·他們説聯合各黨各派，共同努力抗敵救國，這話多麼好聽。但是我們要根究·他們的心目中怎樣聯合法？他們説，承認中國蘇維埃政府，劃區域為蘇維埃紅軍的防地，紅軍歸蘇維埃政府調動指揮。試問：蘇維埃政府是不是中國的政府？紅軍是不是中國的軍隊？假使是中國的政府，為什麼不站在國民政府之下而要單獨成立政府？假使是中國的軍隊，為什麼不編到中國國軍旗幟之下，用國軍的番號？在一個國家內，政府組織不同，軍隊系統不同，還可以容忍着來聯合嗎？聯合了就可以和平嗎？那麼滿洲和冀東的漢奸，誰不是中國人，説句笑話，他們也何常不可躲避於“聯合”口號之下向我們要求和平？我們還根據着什麼來肅清漢奸？在“聯合戰綫”之口號下，他們還有一句話，説是中國人不打中國人。這話不錯，但是這句話如果出在漢奸之口，用以堵住我們的討伐和收復失地，殷汝耕説中國人不打中國人，溥儀也説中國人不打中國人，那麼中國將永久不能統一了。所以這句話只能出於自願投誡的叛徒口中，他們一旦覺悟了，不受外敵的利用，明白了中國人不打中國人，趕快向中央投誠，請求收編，如同綏邊王英所部將領一樣，這才所謂中國人不打中國人是講得通了。為什麼？因為這是促成統一的·反之，如果赤匪或叛將用這句話來阻止中央國軍的討伐和進動，龍是保障割據而破壞統一的，何有和平之可言？所以，根據了這些似是而非的口號，假名聯合，决不足以達到和平，祇有統一才可以真和平。所謂“聯合”，是假的，騙人的，實在不過要藉這個口號來圖掙扎，圖發展而已。（未完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>三斤十二兩的脚鐐</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>自来监狱刑罪犯人的方法，可説是設想得頗為周到的。既囚之以牢獄，又加之以鐐枷，好像非如此，便不足以懲戒壞人似的。現時我國監獄中所用的刑具，枷也許已廢棄了，鐐却還是有的。枷是一種項械，舊製以乾木為之，長三尺，徑二尺九寸，重二十五斤。把這種刑具，加在囚徒的項上，真是吃不消。鐐就是脚鎖，大小輕重若干，不得而知。但據司法部最近通令，規定脚鐐最重，不得超過三斤七二兩，令各省法院，轉紡各監獄恪遵，不准濫用云云。犯人的脚上，聲一個幾斤重的鐵鐐，其痛苦也是可以想像得到的。</p>
<p>就一般情形看，監獄之對待囚徒，往往是殘酷的，每惟恐其懲戒之不兇。像脚鐐一項，司法部既説不准濫用，可見以前是有“濫用”的。本來一個人犯罪，禁在牢獄里，已失去一切自由。若再施以各種的刑罰，就更增加其痛苦了。這次司法部通令，規定脚鐐最重不得超過三斤十二兩，可算是加惠犯人之舉，用意甚善。</p>
<p>然便是三斤十二兩的脚鐐，在囚徒仍是難堪的。若能棄掉，犯人豈非大受其賜。近來各國監獄之對待犯人，頗多改善。不但不施刑罰，且予以各種的優過，以減輕一般囚徒的痛苦。據説有的監獄，對於犯人，并不加禁閉，只令在一特定的地方工作·但結果成績很好，犯人皆能安分守己。由這一點看，可知刑罰並非是懲戒囚徒最良的辦法。</p>
<p>前些時日，曾有人想替犯人解決性慾問題，主張在相當的時期之內，應予犯人以滿足性慾的機會。這事贊成的有，反對的也有。惟據我看來，一個囚徒拘在牢獄中，受盡百般之痛苦，性方面的要求，也許比較不大强烈了。要是把這種三斤十二兩的脚鐐，代為除去，犯人倒是再感恩沒有的。</p>
<h3>出感化院以後</h3>
<p>— 方克文</p>
<p>全國慈幼協會對於“幼吾幼以及人之幼”的工作真是值得人感佩的，往者不談，就以最近上書工部局，要求創辦兒童罪犯感化學校這件事來説罷，那熱心已够我們這輩要時常替子弟擔心成為罪犯的小民似感恩非淺了。</p>
<p>慈幼協會什么時候上書工部局的我們不知道，最近在報上看到工部局警備委員會開會結果預備函復該會的新聞，才知道有這麼會事。工部局開會的結果，是“經認為難以實行”，其理由為：</p>
<p>“該會如注意於兒童罪犯之感化，可與工部局監獄當局接洽，商議一種合作計劃，使已經受感化之兒童在出獄以後，得受保護等語。據局方之意見，設立此種學校，在財政方面，既須考慮，且似非切要，現在之兒童感化所雖設於監獄之內，但其所址與監獄間有麼垣隔絕，自成為一完全單位，教師均係有經驗之人員，足以勝任：監獄當局以為設立一種組織，以保證出感化院以後之兒童，較創辦另一感化學校為切要。……”</p>
<p>慈幼協會上的條陳，內容如何，我們可惜不知道，但看了工部局“經認為難以實行”的決議，我們却也覺得言之成理，罪犯們在獄的感化，不在乎在獄的感化與否，而在乎出獄以從的是否有保證，不然，漂亮動聽的名詞不足當飯吃，良民等等頭衔不足當衣穿，為了衣食不濟，感化還是等於虛設的。衣食足然後知榮辱，“設立一種組織，以保護出感化院以後之兒童，較創辦另一感化學校為切要，”這不但是兒童，引至大人，也是如此。</p>
<p>出感化院以後之兒童，如何保證呢？這問題是值得我們深深考慮的。憑我們所看到的，碼頭上有露宿偷竊的小癟三，午夜的橋頭有“拉黃牛”的小叫化，再放眼看去，更是數不盡許多，這些這些，有未進過感化院的嗎？自然也有：但也有已進過感化院，并且不至一次二次的嗎？自然更有；這為什麼呢？“天生賤骨”的評語祇能讓吸着雪茄挺着大肚子的大慈善家去下，我們却不能無視於他們的生活環境。</p>
<p>然而説到生活環境，我們却祇能束手無策了。就連工部局也祇能説“商議一種合作計劃，使已經受感化之兒童在出獄以後得受保護，”并且深深地切要地感受到“設立一種組織，以保證出感化院以後之兒童，較創辦另一感化學校為切要。”</p>
<p>已經受感化之兒童，在出獄以後如何保護？在月前的我們既束手無策，而在蘇俄影片“生路”中，以及班台萊夫的童話“錢”中，却替我們解答了。這些沒有教義，流浪的兒童們，在感化後不僅不有依舊成為廢物或是彷徨無從，並且是成了建設新祉會的生力軍：把他們感化了，使成為建設新社會的生力軍，原似乎不難，而難的，却在乎使這些生力軍有用武之地。這用武之地，在某種社會組織中，或許是到處皆是，而在我們，却除了使他們繼續犯罪，再把他們送到感化院去感化之外就別無他法。結果，就連工部局也祇好希望“商議一種合作計劃，使已經受到感化之兒童在出獄之後得受保護了。”</p>
<p>“保護”是一種消極的辦法，那正跟一切慈善事業同樣。然而我們幾時才能有此“保證”更好的辦法呢？——遑論現在連“保證”都沒有！</p>
<p>慈幼協會的關懷兒童是可感的，工部局“認為難以實行”的理由更是充足之至，同時，他也給我們一個啟示；然而，這種熱心，這種啟示，如果祇是熱心祇是啟示，那麼還是等於白費，於已受感化，正受感化或將受感化的一切窮苦兒童，都沒有實際的用處。</p>
<p>我們能眼看從感化院送出來的兒童，再送到感化院去嗎？我願一問留心兒童的教養問題和一切有第妹子女的人們注意。</p>
<h3>完備的藥房大廈</h3>
<p>— 善</p>
<p>去年我國醫藥界有一椿大事，就是上海落成了一個完備的藥房大廈。</p>
<p>藥房是社會上重要的機關，人人都要和他發生關係，現在這個大廈落成，更給予世人不少的便利。</p>
<p>這藥房大廈是怎樣的完備呢？那不但是建筑富麗堂皇，內容設備也非常精美，冷熱氣冬暖夏涼，沙發椅可以隨意安坐，舉凡家用良藥，原料藥品，化裝香品，醫藥器械，稱菓食品，………無一不備。配藥都服務謹慎週到，店員對於顧客，都是殷勤招待，至於貨價，比較別家也都便宜。而且四層樓上，特設各科診室，主診的都是上海第一流的名醫師。我想大家都知道這完備的大廈，就是四馬路上的五洲大藥房了。</p>
<h3>王小弟過年</h3>
<p>— 新喜</p>
<p>王家小弟弟過了這個年，還不滿一週歲，但是他居然能立得牢牢的，走得穩穩的。同時吳家的小弟弟，過了這個年，巳經一歲半，但是他却立不牢，更走不穩，這是甚麼原因呢？</p>
<p>原來嬰兒的骨骼如果未堅，就不能支持身體。王家小弟弟生下來四個月，他的父母每天就給他吃五洲“家藥鈣”巧克力，這種巧克力裹面含有鈣素和維他命丁，是堅强骨骼的重要原料，嬰兒既得到這种寶贵的成分補充，所以發育格外快，骨骼也特別堅强，不但使他走路早，並且造成他一生強健的基礎。吳家小弟弟的父母因為不知道給嬰兒吃這種滋補營養的糖，所以就沒有像王家小弟弟這種意外的成績了！</p>
<h3>恐怖中的溫情</h3>

<p>——山行雜什</p>
<p>大熱天，出冷汗，這事也許要引起人的驚奇，説不定會疑慮到那是中暑，或者有什麼神經衰弱的症候上去，其實，並不這樣，我們的神經既很健全，而中暑在年青的小伙子身上根本也不會讓牠存在的。</p>
<p>然而，不知怎麼，總覺得空氣里有一股陰寒，這陰寒，決不是體力可以克制的，望着葱蓊的樹林，望一下傍晚時分迷濛的山色，遠處，有一層煙霧罩着矗立的山峯，嬌陽投到濃重的烟霧里，反射到葱翳的樹梢上，紅艷，橙黃，變化着，天空，圍着夕陽的有一片艷霞，那色澤緊緊地印在橋下的河流里，美麗的自然吶！</p>
<p>這美麗的景色，在多嶂氣的山窩子里，誠然是少見的，然而，牠引不起我們的留連，空氣里有一把刀子貫穿了我們的心，流着殷紅的血，事實給我們以嚴重的威脅！</p>
<p>——這近段，千萬去不得呵！老伕頭又在第二次的叮囑了，隨着，他的眼睛轉了幾下，彷彿在想什么似的，也許是他的心血來潮吧？指着過了橋那一方的小路上，上山的路口做好了一個很好的屏障，他説：“算起來不過才是半年以前的事，同李三押着四十名伕子走過這里，落棧，在不提防的瞬息間，小主人是失踪了，老遠的還聽見有人呼喊，等到循着聲浪奔了過去，另一個人却臥倒了，被刺傷了腿部和胸部，山的那方却投過來勝利的呼嘯。”他摸了一下鬍子，眼睛落到每個人的臉上。</p>
<p>——以後呢？</p>
<p>——那還用説，在山地既没有醫院，也找不出什么醫生，趕路畢竟是要緊的，就在當天的夜晚，傷者呻吟着，漸次的停止了他的呼吸！</p>
<p>説起來這好像是演義小説中的一節，那富有神祕性的草莽英雄，那留下“買路錢”的傳説的表縯，甚至那相互間的搏戰以及一方的戰敗逃亡，這些，又清楚的翻騰在腦袋里。一個寒噤打遍了全身，在這條街上的人們隨便向我們多看兩眼的時候，就會神經質的疑慮到他們的眼色里或者也包藏着“禍心”的，於此，不能自主的心在跳躍起來，一直到他們去得很遠以後。</p>
<p>不管恐怖的成分怎么樣，這地方的風色的確太可愛了，一條弓形的街，緊連着那頂石橋，橋欄上堆砌成𣝢美的字形，河流蜿蜒着伸到山嘴那面去，橋堍，有一方小廟，那里據説供的是“山神”，白的臉，黑的鬍鬚，神采到有點飄飄然的。傳説山神對於夜行人的功勞是很不為小的，他能够鎮攝虎狼，阻撓強盜，那末，為什么在白天他不顯示一下威靈呢？</p>
<p>吃飯的時候，多承老板娘的關情，在豆腐花里多放了些鹽粑，對於少有鹽食的我們，自然已受惠不淺了。老板是五十開外的人了，而老板娘的年歲，看上去不過打個對折，有一股熱情在她的心里燃燒着，對於年青的小伙子在賣弄着風情，脈脈地情緒中似乎含有無限的深意，她説我們講的話是苗語，她也説我們的身材和樣子有些像外國人，她并不顧忌的向我們説笑，雖説在美的條件上她沒有具備，可是，少婦的情韻總是可愛的。然而在今天，無論她的熱情怎樣的奔放，於我們可以説都深存着戒心的，總覺得她的説笑不很自然，里面説不定會埋伏着其他的用意，因之，那山口上被刺傷了的人兒又重現在眼前，彷彿看見一個血淋淋地的身子。</p>
<p>夜里，那里能睡得着呢？雖則在大熱天，冷汗却浸潤了整個的蓆子，翻復，轉側，靜聽那水流，黑的恐怖咬在心頭。突然，院子里起了極輕微的脚步聲，怪亟促的,就着窗口望了一下，老板娘走在前面，小伕頭跟在後面，隱沒在山牆的後跨院里，於是，我忖度的笑了。</p>
<p>——恐怖的夜里，還有不平凡的溫情的演出吶！</p>
<h3>夢</h3>
<p>— 程瑚</p>
<p>廚川白村説：“聽説出去探險南極的人們，缺少了食物的時候，那些人們的多數所夢見的東西是山海的珍味。又聽説旅行亞非力加的荒遠的沙漠的人，夜夜走過的夢境，是美麗的故國的山河。”無異的這種説法是證明了“夢”是“苦悶的象征”。</p>
<p>平常我們對生活慾望得不到滿足，往往在夢境中獲得了滿意和快感。</p>
<p>幻想最容易使我們快樂，但也最容易使我們苦惱；如果生活的苦悶在夢中顯現時，往往變為複雜的可恐怖的形象。我常從夢中驚醒，心跳着，渾身出汗。所以説幻想若在夢境再現，即變為事實，在演着離奇的慘苦的悲劇或完滿的愉悅的喜劇。</p>
<p>夢的發生一定與生活狀態以及精神的變化有關。買了航空獎券的人，做夢往往夢着得了大彩。戀愛者的渴望也往往趁着睡眠的時候跑到意識的世界裹去，尤其是年青人，對於異性的渴求，運用全副精神去發見對方的神祕，事實上却不能如愿以償，但有時在夢中却得到了滿足，自然也有得到苦痛的時候。</p>
<p>由於生活的不安定，近來我時常做夢。差不多每夜都進夢境。我疑心自己是害神经衰弱症？似乎又不像。可是白天精神上所受的打擊、那在晚上會在夢中得到報復和安慰。</p>
<h3>沙船</h3>
<p>— 瑞芝</p>
<p>沙浦村前的沙滩上，一排的沙船平靜的在早晨的太陽光下休息着，雖然那沙滩上還有十幾個船印，但是到底随着早潮而去的沙船，也就只有十多雙吧了。在往日，當着太陽從水平錢下浮上來的時候，沙灘上已是一雙小船也沒有了，而太陽所照耀着的就是那被早潮帶去了的沙船所存留下來的總長排的船印，和那赤裸着身體在那沙灘上撿取被早風所遺棄的蚌和蛤等的村童。</p>
<p>沙浦村的人，除了一部份是靠捕魚過活之外，其餘的，就都依那早晨向着那沙灘外漂去面晚上又漂回來的沙船了。</p>
<p>當着早潮到來的時候，沙灘上就是一陣的熱鬧，村裹的壯健的男子，一個個豁出那一身強健的肌肉，跳上那些空着的沙船，年老的搖着撑，一剎那間，那一長排的船，三五成群的向着那黃漠</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>

<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>的海中漂去。約莫是距離沙浦二三海里的海面上，沙船一雙雙的停住了。年老的人把着插在水裹的竹竿，年青的人一個個赤條條的拿着竹箕，向着水裹沉下去，一剎那間，落下去是空着的竹箕，浮上來時是一箕的黃色的沙泥，這樣的一上一下，從上午到了午後，那空着的沙船，已都堆滿着一載一載的黃沙了。</p>
<p>是太陽將近沉下的時候了，汕市的海旁的沙廠前，却集聚着無數的裝滿着黃沙的木船，沙浦村的，大尾村的，媽港村的，四處的沙船，都巳經集合在那沙廠前，每元三十擔有時四十擔的向那沙廠外的岸邊上堆起來，到了快近天黑的時候，一船船的黃沙變成了兩三塊洋錢，沙廠前又歸於平靜，集合着的沙船，也在炭色的海面上消失去了。</p>
<p>沙浦村裹四處的屋頂繚繞着晚炊的烟霧的時候，沙滩前又停住着那空着的一長排的沙船了。在水裹浸了一整日的年青的壯健的人，一個個伸伸腰從船裹走上來，拿着一日所得的幾角錢的代價，向着村裹走去，他們的生活，就這樣的維持着，他們也就是這樣一天一天的在為生活而消磨了一生。</p>
<p>可是近來，海面上却終日的漂着一些插着紅色的太陽旗的用機器撈沙的鐵船，因為人力與那械力一比較，就會顯出很大的強弱來，插着太陽旗的沙船，不到一二個鐘頭已經是滿載的向汕市開去了，沙廠前已經等不到沙浦村，大尾村等處的沙船到來，那岸上已堆上了成山的黃沙了，像這樣只有十幾萬市民的狹小的城市，像這樣多的沙，已足於供給一日中建築的所需了，等沙浦村等處再運來的沙，已經是多餘的產量了，雖然沙廠的人知道靠撈沙吃飯的人是自己的可憐的同胞，但是每元五六十擔與三四十擔的價錢上，却使他們只有向插着太陽旗的沙船去收貨了。自然，為了生活，為了工作得到極少的代價，沙浦村各處的沙船，也只好每元五六十擔的出售了，这樣終日工作的代價已是漸漸不能維持生活了。但是插着太陽旗的沙船，却每元的沙又從五六十擔增加到七八十擔了，像这樣，沙浦村前的沙滩上的沙船，終於停作了，雖然每天還有十多雙去海中工作，但有時却只換到一二斗米的代價回來。雖然沙船上工作的人每每怨着冬天的冰冷，夏天的灼熱，感到那是世界上最苦的工作，但現在看着長排終日停泊在沙灘上的船，却感到更加的苦痛，因為他們就連那最苦的工作，都不能再做下去了、這在他們也許只有抱怨着自己，怒罵着那插着太陽旗還在灘面上標的沙船，他們是不會想到這正是沒有武力沒有國防的國家的人民所必遇到的痛苦呀！但是，沙浦村前的沙船，是永遠那樣平靜的休息着嗎？</p>

<h3>Yan Xishan Addresses the People of Shanxi and Suiyuan</h3>
<p>[Taiyuan] Yan Xishan addressed the people of Shanxi and Suiyuan, saying, "Suiyuan is the gateway to the five northwestern provinces, and Shanxi is the plateau of the eleven northern and northwestern provinces. These two provinces are not only related to the north but also to the entire country. In this war of resistance, the people of Suiyuan have worked hard on the front lines and contributed a lot, and the people of Shanxi have also worked hard in the rear and contributed a lot of money. The entire province of Suiyuan was originally a part of Shanxi but was separated as a special zone in the first year of the Republic. I hope the people of Shanxi will work hard to assist Suiyuan and understand that this effort is just the beginning. In the future, there must be even greater efforts to protect our own safety and the northwestern gateway of the country." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>Many Japanese and Korean Ronin Rob Tianjin Customs Warehouse</h3>
<p>Stolen Confiscated Goods Intercepted by French Police - Six Ronin Extradited to Japanese Police Station</p>
<p>[Tianjin] On the night of the 20th, Tianjin Customs seized sixteen bales of smuggled hemp yarn and some bags of sugar transported from the lower reaches of the Hai River at the Special District Three pier. The goods were piled into the customs warehouse at the French Concession pier overnight. At 4 AM on the 21st, suddenly more than forty Japanese and Korean ronin and twenty-odd Han Chinese traitors arrived in two heavy-duty trucks and drove to the customs warehouse, trying to demand the return of the smuggled goods from the customs officers. It being Sunday, the customs officers were off duty. Unable to achieve their goal, the ronin broke the warehouse lock and stole the confiscated goods, along with old confiscated goods stored in the warehouse, filling the two trucks and driving towards a certain concession. Passing French Central Street, the French Municipal Council learned of this and dispatched a large number of detectives to intercept them. The ronin fled in all directions, but six were captured. The goods were scattered on the street and taken away by the French Municipal Council. In the afternoon, Japanese Vice-Consul Nishida and Police Chief Wakui, accompanied by the French Municipal Council Director, extradited the six ronin. The goods were returned to customs. Tianjin Customs Commissioner Meier has not yet made any statement. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

Inspector Feng was seriously injured and has been hospitalized. The smuggled goods belonged to the East Asia Trading Company in the Japanese Concession.

The Municipal Council is reserving the matter and will submit a protest against disturbing the security of the concession in the coming days. Customs also plans to protest. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Ministry of Finance plans to establish an inland river anti-smuggling inspection office and appoint Li Tonghua as its director to assist customs in strictly suppressing smuggling. Li arrived recently to discuss thorough methods of land and water anti-smuggling with Li Xing, Meier, and others. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>Original Text of the Third Plenary Session's Resolution on Eradicating the Red Menace</h3>
<p>Four Minimum Measures for Communist Sincerity - Abolish All Organizations That Undermine Unity - Cease Red Propaganda and Class Struggle</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Sixth Session of the Third Plenary Session passed the resolution proposed by the Presidium regarding the eradication of the Red Menace on the afternoon of the 21st. The original text is as follows: "Our party, entrusted with a historical mission, following the teachings of the Premier Sun Yat-sen, is dedicated to the National Revolution, to building the nation and restoring the nation. Holding the principle of 'no foreigners' in the Spring and Autumn Annals, we aspire to the governance of the Great Harmony for the world. Within the country, we have no narrow-minded views, only seeking to gather the strength of China, lay the foundation for unity, and strive for China's freedom and equality. Therefore, all those who adhere to the Three Principles of the People, follow the path of revolution, and are willing to work together for the National Revolution are welcomed as comrades, and we sincerely accommodate them. This is the consistent spirit of the Premier in founding the Xingzhonghui, the Tongmenghui, the Chinese Revolutionary Party, and ultimately the Chinese Nationalist Party. Therefore, in the era of the Xingzhonghui and the Tongmenghui, we extended invitations to patriots with national ideals. During the reorganization in the thirteenth year of the Republic, we allowed individual members of the Communist Party to join our party. These historical facts are clear for all to see. However, after joining our party, the Communists broke their oaths. Under the cover of our party, they initially secretly built up their own forces and then divided our party in many ways. At that time, our party still tried to tolerate them, hoping they would repent. But when the National Revolutionary Army conquered Hunan and Hubei, and Wuhan, they severed the connection between our party and the people and planted the seeds of red terror in an attempt to undermine the foundation of our party's revolution and nation-building, hinder the eastward advance of our army to Shanghai and Nanjing, obstruct the northern pacification of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, develop the horrors of the two lakes, and create the painful history of the Nanjing-Wuhan split. The great cause of the Northern Expedition almost came to a halt. They also openly advocated the creation of the Red Army, undermined our party's cadres, incited class struggle, and seized revolutionary power. In order to consolidate the party's foundation, complete the Northern Expedition, and save the people, our party had no choice but to make a decisive decision and carry out the purge. The Communists thus severed their ties with the nation and with our party. The events of the past are vividly remembered and witnessed by the world. Subsequently, they continued to spread their heresies, bewitching the youth, and organized themselves into armed bands to harass and cause trouble everywhere, causing harm for more than ten years and poisoning dozens of provinces. From the revolts in Wuhan, Nanchang, Guangzhou, and Changsha to Lufeng and Haifeng in Guangdong, Longyan and Yongding in Fujian, Ji'an, Shangrao, Yongxin, Tonggu, and Yiyang in Jiangxi, Pingjiang, Liuyang, and Huarong in Hunan, Mianyang, Huang'an, and Jianli in Hubei, and Shangcheng and Hanchuan in Henan, wherever the bandits went, the fields were turned into ruins. They also falsely established governments, causing Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Hubei provinces to suffer the longest and the people to suffer the deepest. The central government has a responsibility to protect the people. Towards the bandits who poison the people, we have no choice but to eliminate them. Over the past few years, we have carried out successive campaigns of suppression. Relying on the wisdom, bravery, and loyalty of our officers and soldiers, upholding the Three Principles of the People, and sacrificing and fighting bravely, we have finally been able to eradicate their roots. Wherever the areas once occupied by bandits are recovered by the nation, we immediately take measures to soothe the people, recruit refugees, and within a few months, the area gradually returns to its former appearance. The people live in peace and are happy to be where they are. Our benevolence contrasts with their cruelty. Even women and children know this. Since the total collapse of the bandits in Jiangxi, from the borders of Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan to Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Shanxi provinces, they first coerced the people and then slaughtered them, destroying and burning houses, doing their utmost to destroy the economy of cities and rural areas, leaving few survivors. These are all obvious facts and need not be enumerated in detail. What is particularly distressing is that since the September 18th Incident, the national crisis has been so severe. Under the unified government, the people of the whole country are implementing centralized national power, uniting sincerely, and dedicating themselves to construction to strengthen national defense against foreign aggression, fearing it is not enough. But the Communists take advantage of the nation's crisis of survival to disrupt and disturb at will. During the Battle of Shanghai, they fiercely attacked Ganzhou. During the battles at the various passes of the Great Wall, they fiercely attacked Yangzhou, endangering Nanchang, causing the army resisting the enemy to be restrained. Other acts of undermining national defense and destroying the people's livelihood have become even more intensified. Thinking of this, the whole country is indignant. Now that the Communists are in dire straits and propose the theory of sincerity and acceptance of orders, our party is broad-minded and will never cut off the path of self-renewal. However, learning from the past, we cannot make the same mistake again. Unless they sincerely repent, submit to the Three Principles of the People, strictly abide by the laws of the country, strictly abide by military orders, and behave as good citizens of the Republic of China, the central government, in order to maintain national security and safeguard the lives and property of the people of the whole country, cannot disregard the long-term interests of hundreds of millions of people and condone a few cunning people, leaving endless worries for the nation. In terms of the minimum measures currently, first, the army of a country must have unified organization and unified command in order to achieve effective results. There is absolutely no country that can allow the coexistence of armies with incompatible ideologies. Therefore, it is necessary to completely abolish the so-called "Red Army" and other armed forces under false pretenses. Second, unified political power is a necessary condition for national unity. No country in the world is allowed to have two political powers within its borders. Therefore, it is necessary to completely abolish the so-called "Soviet government" and all other organizations that undermine unity. Third, red propaganda is absolutely incompatible with the Three Principles of the People, which takes saving the country and the people as its mission. It is also extremely contrary to the lives and social life of our people. Therefore, it is necessary to fundamentally stop red propaganda. Fourth, class struggle takes the interests of one class as its position. Its method divides the entire society into various opposing classes, causing them to kill and hate each other. Therefore, it inevitably resorts to the means of extravagant extortion of the people and armed rebellion, causing social unrest and the destruction of homes. Therefore, it is necessary to fundamentally stop class struggle. In short, no independent and sovereign country can tolerate organizations that are anti-national, anti-national, and dependent on foreign forces, nor can it tolerate any acts that harm people's livelihood and destroy morality. Our party bears the responsibility of building the nation and establishing the people. The Communist, feudal, separatist, autocratic, and cruel tactics, as well as their actions and propaganda that use international organizations as their background and undermine national unity, are absolutely contrary to the main purpose of building the nation and establishing the people. We must know that only by restoring the inherent spirit and morality of the Chinese nation and establishing the independent personality of the Republic of China can we restore the inherent territory of the Republic of China and inherit the historical glory of our Chinese nation to realize the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, the eradication of the Red Menace is the most important and unchangeable way to protect our nation and our country. All those who understand this principle, have the determination, and express it with facts before the entire nation are welcome. Otherwise, we must still prioritize the national interests and the lives of the people and must not lightly believe in cunning words, leaving endless troubles for the nation and the country. This is the responsibility of our party and we dare to announce it to all compatriots." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>Japanese Newspaper Reports That the Hayashi Cabinet Will Change Its Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>Turning to Promoting Contact Between the People of the Two Countries - Will Temporarily Abandon Political Demands</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, Japanese Prime Minister Senjuro Hayashi announced yesterday at the general meeting of the budget in the House of Representatives the cabinet's decision to make a significant change in its policy toward China. Based on the fact that Japan will never seek to seize any part of Chinese territory, the focus will be on promoting Sino-Japanese cultural relations. After harmonious relations between the two countries are restored, important political issues such as tariff issues and transportation routes will be addressed. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 21st)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Asahi Shimbun and the Nichinichi Shimbun published news this morning in prominent positions that the Hayashi Cabinet will change its policy toward China. The former pointed out that Japan's policy toward China will shift toward promoting contact between the people of the two countries, while the latter predicted that Japan will temporarily abandon political demands. The main points of the Asahi Shimbun's report are as follows: The Hayashi Cabinet believes that the previous negotiations were deadlocked because of the insistence on resolving political issues as a prerequisite. Therefore, the policy will be changed to focus on promoting economic and cultural cooperation between the people of the two countries in order to improve the feelings between the two countries. Since there is an inseparable connection between economy and politics, Japan can still seek solutions to other political issues while engaging in economic activities, because political issues are relatively easy to resolve. In short, the two key points of the Hayashi Cabinet's policy are: ㊀ The policy toward China is mainly to promote mutual cooperation and first solve economic and cultural issues, and then proceed to solve political issues. ㊁ Continue to handle the issues on which the Chinese and Japanese governments reached a consensus during last year's negotiations. According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, the Hayashi Cabinet believes that there is currently no possibility of continuing political negotiations. Therefore, the newspaper stated that the current cabinet has decided to completely abandon last year's negotiations. The six political demands, including the special status of North China and joint anti-communism, will be temporarily abandoned, but negotiations on tariff issues will continue. In other words, the Hayashi Cabinet will stop negotiating political issues and mainly focus its efforts on economic and diplomatic aspects. Regarding Prime Minister Hayashi's reply yesterday at the general meeting of the budget in the House of Representatives to the question of Sakurai Hyogoro of the Seiyukai, the reporter felt that this reply indicated that Hayashi considered Hirota and Arita's three principles to be unsuitable for the current situation and firmly believed that the implementation of Japan's policy toward China should be based on easing the emotions of the two countries. The Nichinichi Shimbun's news may be based on overly optimistic speculation, but the Asahi Shimbun's observation is more consistent with the actual situation here. That is, regarding the so-called economic cooperation, important figures here are also strongly inclined to avoid similar political loans and prefer to carry out purely economic cooperation. However, it is natural that Japan does not want to completely abandon the hope of continuing negotiations on certain political issues. Even if this is the case, the fact that the Hayashi Cabinet's direction of policy toward China is different from that of Hirota and Arita is itself worthy of our attention. Japanese economic envoy to China Kenji Kodama is expected to depart around next month, and other leaders of the Japanese economic community may come to China in a private capacity.

<h3>Going to Bailing Temple (2)</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Qian Hua</p>
<p>Over a hundred "li" of uninhabited area in Mongolian land - the lives of soldiers on the ice and snow frontier beyond the Great Wall</p>
<p>❶</p>
<p>Dressed like a wild bear</p>
<p>When the reporter set out northward, it was truly the depths of winter. Traveling to an extremely cold place in extremely cold weather, I was fully prepared with warm clothes. Unexpectedly, upon arriving in Tianjin and Beiping, the weather was still relatively warm. When I arrived in Suiyuan on January 20th, although it was a bit colder, I could still manage with the clothes I wore in Shanghai without adding anything. Local friends told me that the weather in Bailing Temple was different. Shanghai-style attire would not work at all; otherwise, I would definitely catch a cold. Losing a finger or toe was a small matter. The reporter hurriedly bought a large fox fur Mongolian-style hat and a pair of long "Jiadengke" boots. "Jiadengke" is a Russian word meaning the warmest reindeer skin boots. Reindeer skin boots are extremely expensive. In Suiyuan, the common "Jiadengke" is a long boot made entirely of felt, including the sole. Therefore, I confidently stayed at the Suiyuan Hotel, waiting for the provincial government to allocate a vehicle. The Sui Province is very short of vehicles. Recently, many official and unofficial inspection and consolation groups have been going to Suiyuan, so there are even fewer vehicles to be allocated to the front lines. After waiting for three days, the provincial government's reception team notified me to travel with the Shanghai Women and Children's Comfort Group. We departed from Suiyuan at 8:30 AM on the 23rd. Beforehand, I put on all the clothes in my luggage, making me so bloated that I had difficulty walking. Upon arriving at the designated meeting point, the provincial government borrowed old sheepskin coats, large fur hats, and Jiadengke boots for the twenty or so women and children, dressing them up like wild bears, making everyone burst into laughter. We had a total of four trucks, two with canopies and two open. The trucks with canopies were naturally reserved for the women and children, who had priority. The reporter bravely jumped into an open truck, along with the battalion commander and platoon leaders from the Bailing Temple front line, and several people in the same profession. The truck was piled with food baskets and gasoline drums, and we sat down haphazardly, squeezing together. Leaving Suiyuan city, we sang military songs all the way, inspiring and generous, with blood coursing through our veins. The piercing north wind blew incessantly on our faces, but we did not feel afraid at all. We passed the Suiyuan War Memorial Cemetery and headed straight for Dayin Mountain. From a distance, the mountain range looked like a winding serpent, extremely majestic. The car wound through the mountains. The surrounding hills undulated, and on the rugged mountain roads, the car traveled like a boat in stormy seas, tilting and bumping without a moment's peace. The women and children in the covered trucks vomited profusely, their groans echoing the rumbling of the vehicles. The car climbed between cliffs and precipices, truly a dangerous place. The open truck offered an unobstructed view, a terrain that even an army of thousands with wings could not fly over. After half an hour, we reached the summit, the highest point. The distant mountain peaks were all below our feet. The car stopped briefly, giving the women and children a chance to catch their breath. But they no longer looked human.</p>
<p>❷</p>
<p>The taste of an open truck</p>
<p>The climate here was very different from Suiyuan. The cold wind was bone-chilling. Taking out the camera, my fingers froze. But I could still endure it. As the car descended, the speed increased, and the wind became even stronger. The temperature difference between the north and south sides of Yin Mountain seemed like a different season. The road conditions became even more treacherous and rugged. After five minutes, we saw a stone tablet by the roadside, inscribed with the four characters "Turning Danger into Safety" by Gu Hongchang, formerly of the Northwest Army. It turned out that the road construction was completed when the Northwest Army was stationed in Suiyuan, leaving an indelible achievement. This was the historically famous Centipede Dam. The so-called dam was a mountain path formed by streams, which had long since become a valley, covered with ice and snow, a necessary route to and from the mountains. The car spiraled out of the mountains. Along the way, we saw camels and horses transporting goods. Walking slowly, it would take a whole day to go up and down the mountain. We could imagine the pain of traffic congestion in the past. At 11 AM, we arrived in Wuchuan County, where we had lunch. The county magistrate of Wuchuan, Dong Wancheng, entertained us very warmly. We were really starved, so we feasted without ceremony. Magistrate Dong, a native of Hebei, used to live in Beiping. He was recently appointed as the acting county magistrate of Sui Province. He was a very adept person in social interactions, speaking fluent Beijing dialect. He brought out all the food he had hidden to entertain the travelers from afar, treating us like brothers and sisters. His hospitality was truly touching. On the table were Hami raisins, Tianjin grapes, Beiping pastries, Suzhou melon seeds, and so on. We could not eat enough. After the fatigue, it felt so comfortable to enjoy ourselves here. Wuchuan County is a relatively large county town in Suiyuan Province. The entire town consists of earthen houses, with a desolate appearance, fully revealing the poverty of the land and its people. We continued our journey at 1 PM. After traveling for dozens of "li", we arrived at the Mongolian grassland, a flat and open terrain with no place to hide. The sky was vast, the wilderness boundless. Looking as far as the eye could see, it was boundless. Qing Guanning once said, "The sky is like an overturned pot, the clear light far away, the ground like layered waves, the road long," and "Leaping horses beyond the Great Wall, one knows the width of the horizon," are all excellent realistic descriptions. Mongolia is a large plateau, composed of numerous eroded plains and basins, with an altitude of about 1,200 meters or more. There are occasional changes in hills and basins, but the difference is only two or three hundred meters, and the slopes are very gentle. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Gate of Wuchuan County Government</h3>
<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Overlooking the Scenery of Hanchuan</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>Sichuan is surrounded by towering mountains, and the broad central plain, the so-called "abundant land of Sichuan," is almost sealed off by those mountain ranges. Although there is the Yangtze River, winding for thousands of miles, enduring thousands of twists and turns, rushing east to forge a bloody path, converging into the Xiang and Han rivers, sweeping through Anhui and Jiangsu, and heading straight to the Far Eastern Ocean; because it still has to pass through the dangers of the Qutang Three Gorges, the spring light of this "Land of Abundance" cannot be revealed much. Conversely, all external influences on politics, economy, and culture are not easy to enter discreetly. In recent years, the central and local authorities have deeply felt the needs of the times, with external pressure and internal development, and have worked hard on transportation construction, and the results have been rapid progress. For example, starting from Nanjing, no matter what kind of transportation means, land, water, or air, one can quickly knock on the gates of Sichuan and enter the hall. Li Taibai's famous poem "The road to Sichuan is harder than ascending to the blue sky" will become the era reflection word for the developed transportation in Sichuan Province in the future.</p>
<p>The civil aviation route extended to Sichuan earlier than the Eurasia Aviation Corporation. When China first opened a route in Sichuan, it aroused suspicion from the former local authorities, who tried in every way to oppose it. A certain general even threatened: "If you insist on flying in, we will welcome you with anti-aircraft guns in the Three Gorges!" With great difficulty, the company's authorities managed to smooth things over and personally took the first plane to Sichuan to discuss everything. It is said that talking about principles and personal relationships was useless; only bringing two precious gifts, distributed to all parties, produced unexpected results. One was live crabs from Shanghai. At that time, it was the season of high autumn and fat crabs. People living deep in the inland mountain country actually got fresh and delicious fat crabs from thousands of miles away, which was a great joy. The other was the "Shen Bao" newspaper published that day. Usually, it would take two weeks to mail it to Chengdu, but now it suddenly fell from the sky and could be read on the same day. They were happy and a little disbelieving. Thus, the agreement to open the route was smoothly concluded. It is ridiculous that the initial draft of the agreement was drafted by a local student who had studied in France. There were six or seven clauses that copied the airspace agreements signed by France and Germany with enemy countries, which stipulated that neither party could cross the line. Such a contribution, if it could be applied to the current air transport issue between North China and a certain country, would not fail to be a valuable reference. But for this aspect of application, perhaps no one would be willing to make such a brilliant contribution again? This is an interesting story I heard on the plane from Xi'an to Chengdu.</p>
<p>The scenery from Xi'an to Chengdu, initially crossing the Qinling Mountains (i.e., Zhongnan Mountain), has numerous branches and steep peaks. The highest peak reaches 4,500 meters, and the snow on the mountain tops shines brightly. The plane can绕过绕过 the mountain shoulders, or it can raise its head and stand on its shoulders, flying over the snow with a slight tilt. The Eurasia aircraft can fly up to 6,000 meters, so flying over such high mountains is not a problem. The northern mountains of the Qinling Mountains are mostly black, rocky, and without much vegetation; only in the deep valleys, which sink down tens of thousands of feet, is there a faint, dark grayish atmosphere. Occasionally, a few groves of pine and cypress are nurtured – even old trees that are thousands of years old, their branches and leaves are sparse and small, like some algae. Moreover, because of the intricate and peculiar mountain terrain, coupled with the positive and negative aspects of the light, the scenery is truly varied, making people unable to welcome it. Du Gongbu's poem "The sky窥象纬逼, 荡胸生层云" does not seem to be enough to describe the vividness and transcendence of this scene. If we were to soar to the highest point in the sky and overlook, taking a picture by force, it would be exactly a three-dimensional model; unfortunately, it is concrete and micro, but it is much more dull.</p>
<p>Then, from the southern mountains of the Qinling Mountains, all the way to the range of the Bashan Mountains, the tides are less and more, and many trees, rice fields, and houses are discovered. Especially the endless ancient forests of pine and cypress, just changed the landscape, as if taking off the缁服黄冠 of monks and Taoists, and putting on a new outfit that is green and dripping. Yes, this area is the scenery of Southern Shaanxi, not inferior to the Han River basin in Jiangnan. The forest products and agriculture here are very rich, and there are also special products such as lacquer and tung oil, as well as fungus attached to forest pear enclosures, with annual sales of hundreds of thousands of yuan or more. If the magnificent mountains of Zhongnan Mountain can be compared to a幸丈夫, then the scenery of Hanzhong District must be compared to a神龙富丽的美女子. At the same time, the natural environment of the Shu and Han regions can also be referred to as sister states. Since "Hanzhong" is so healthy and beautiful, "Sichuan" is certainly even more beautiful. However, from the perspective of the air route, the rice fields in the Hanzhong area are mostly in the mountains, some are兀然高置 on the bare mountain tops, and some are围绕着 the towering mountain slopes level by level. Although the housing style has not been found to be the same as the cave dwellings in the northern Shaanxi and Guanzhong areas, the houses are mostly scattered everywhere, limited by the mountain terrain. The "Red Bandits" had been entrenched in that area for a long time, and the National Army could not launch a raid to destroy them all. The terrain and houses really caused this. After crossing Bashan and arriving in Sichuan, even in the dead of winter, those生意决然的 beans and wheat, forests and bamboo trees, also weave the open earth into a wide and boundless green carpet. Most of the villages are also relatively large聚屋. However, compared with the livelihoods of the people in northern Shaanxi, who are treated differently by God, why did the people of Sichuan Province still issue the same painful wails? This is also a question worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>On that day's flight, because the scheduled departure time was delayed, it was a little later to arrive in Chengdu. However, the aircraft is equipped with a direction finder, which can use local broadcasts and electrical direction to orient itself. Even in clouds or at night, it can use hearing or vision to identify the direction. For example, if the aircraft has误飞 to the left or right of the航钱, or has仰到站 but is still误飞 in front, it can receive the following wireless telegram, quickly and accurately correcting it. The air route flying along the Yangtze River, from November each year to March of the following year, often has heavy fog, and the climate is very bad. Once, an aircraft that took off from Chengdu wanted to go to Chongqing, but was trapped by clouds and fog, and landed after a long time. Passengers suspected that they had arrived at their destination – Chongqing, but upon closer inspection, they were still in the old place – Chengdu. This is because the aircraft was not equipped with a direction finder, and the pilot was reluctant to take risks.</p>
<p>China's aviation industry is fortunately developing day by day, but most of the pilots rely on foreign talent, which is still somewhat unsatisfactory. Among the German pilots hired by a certain company, some can perform maiden flights in any place according to the Chinese airspace survey map, such as suddenly flying from Changsha to Kunming, or Taiyuan to Ningxia, etc., all can be按图索骥, which is too dangerous. In our national defense sense, it is said that they also have a map of Chinese aviation, which was acquired by our authorities, which is really gratifying and fearful, because since they can sell it to us, who knows if they will not reprint it to sell to other foreigners. Also, once, a certain foreign pilot was caught by宪兵 for secretly carrying two cameras to take pictures, and was dismissed and fired. After this incident occurred, it further increased our doubts and fears. In recent years, the authorities have actively promoted "aviation to save the country", and aviation talents have gradually emerged in large numbers. Taking Eurasia as an example, there are four graduates from Guangzhou Aviation School, Huang Changjue, He Qichao, Chen Hongjia, and Lin Dawang from Hangzhou Aviation School, whose driving skills are proficient, and the Ministry of Communications has also instructed them to participate in practical work. However, foreign pilots and flight operations directors are unwilling to give them the opportunity to drive, and only ask them to do some ancillary work such as electrical affairs. Such a waste of talent is certainly pathetic, and in the sense of "aviation to save the country", there is also the danger of "太阿倒持". The environment in Xinjiang is special. The Shanghai-Xinjiang line, the fastest route to connect Europe and Asia, has been opened and blocked again. It must be said that there is no reason for this. The company's business situation in the past five or six years, the number of shipments in each year, has shown a significant and stable increase. For the tangible and intangible stray aircraft, we must try to recover them. Even if there are obstacles to the agreement and contract, and we inevitably have to suffer some calcium in economic terms, we should also go forward without hesitation and without resignation.</p>

<h3>On Judicial Reform in the United States</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The reform bill for the federal judicial system of the United States is currently being hotly debated. This bill is more of a political, social, and economic reform than a judicial reform. Because the purpose of the bill is to retire the old and stubborn judges in the Supreme Court and replace them with people who have progressive ideas and sympathize with the government's New Deal legislation. If the bill passes Congress, Roosevelt can appoint six new judges. After that, any New Deal legislation will not be at risk of being judged unconstitutional and ineffective by the Supreme Court. The United States' internal reform and socio-economic improvement work can move forward according to the government's plan.</p>
<p>Originally, the United States Constitution defined the powers of the federal government very vaguely. Because the Supreme Court has the power to interpret the Constitution, what the government can do and what it cannot do must be decided by them. In the past, they denied the government's implementation of income tax as legal and ruled the government's minimum wage law as unconstitutional. Since the beginning of the New Deal, many socio-economic legislations in the United States, such as the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act, have been policies that benefit workers and farmers. However, the Supreme Court believes that the federal government cannot interfere with private industries, and agriculture and industry are not something that the government can interfere with and manage. They have successively ruled these laws as invalid. American socio-economic order everywhere requires government intervention, but the Supreme Court restricts it everywhere. This is the biggest reason for the introduction of the judicial reform bill.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the United States Constitution, the judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President for life. Among the current nine judges, four are relatively sympathetic to the New Deal, while the other five are outdated in their thinking and speak for the capitalists. The President has no power to remove them from office. However, Congress has the power to increase the number of judges. Among the nine judges, six are already over seventy years old. Some have reached the age of eighty-one. Most are around seventy-five years old. Using these old people to judge the country's most serious problems is naturally very dangerous. Therefore, the reform bill advocates that judges over the age of seventy should retire automatically. If they do not resign, the President can appoint six new judges to join the work. Also, when lower federal courts declare whether Congress's laws are illegal, they must first notify Congress. This proposal is to avoid excessive judicial interference in legislation and to allow the government the freedom to promote its socio-economic policies. Anyone with a slight progressive idea is naturally sympathetic.</p>
<p>However, the United States Supreme Court has a very high prestige in the minds of the people. Americans worship the Constitution and regard the Supreme Court as the protector of the Constitution. Roosevelt's request for them to retire automatically will naturally make conservative citizens dissatisfied. In particular, Republican politicians and Wall Street financial tycoons do not want their spokespersons to withdraw from the highest judicial organ. The passage of the reform bill still depends on the arduous efforts of progressives. This dispute can be said to be a competition between progressive and backward ideas. Which direction will the United States go in the future? The success or failure of the judicial reform bill is a clear indicator.</p>
<h3>World Education Conference to be Held in Tokyo</h3>

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Strengthens Administrative Function</h3>
<p>Establishment of General Affairs Agency Possible</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The policy guidelines and policies announced by the Hayashi Cabinet are too abstract and fail to clarify their guiding spirit. However, from the Prime Minister and the year-old Prime Minister's replies in the Diet over the past week, it has gradually become clear that the current Cabinet's plan to renew all aspects of administration is to make the mobilization of financial institutions and the active expansion of productivity the greatest mission for the sake of realizing the enrichment of national defense. The government believes that unifying the provinces is the most effective way to achieve this goal through integrated administration. Prime Minister Hayashi has also stated that a central organization should be established to integrate the administrative departments. The issue of establishing a General Affairs Agency, which has been pending since the previous Cabinet, is expected to be realized after the Diet session ends. However, the government believes that there is no need to forcibly implement the merger of provinces, so there is no certainty of realization. However, the government intends to strengthen the functions of the General Affairs Agency and appoint powerful figures as its head, in order to achieve strong and integrated administration.

<h3>Electricity and Steel National Policy</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The attitudes of various political parties towards the government's handling of the electricity national management plan are attracting much attention. Recently, in view of the importance of the bill, opinions demanding that the government clarify its policy early have gradually become stronger. Therefore, the government has decided to decide on the policy on electricity issues at a cabinet meeting on the 22nd, and express its attitude at the budget general meeting on the same day.

<p>[Tokyo] Handling the problem of poor ore is now the focus of the Iron and Steel Policy Committee. Minister Godo Takamasa has held positive views on this issue since he was the president of Showa Steel Works. After taking office as the Minister, he devoted all his efforts to this, believing that the implementation of the plans for handling poor ore in Musan, Korea and Anshan, Manchuria, and the establishment of the Tohoku Iron Sand Refining Plant will definitely lead to revolutionary progress in the steel industry. Regarding the handling of the Musan ore problem, Mitsubishi Mining, Showa Steel, and Nippon Steel are currently negotiating to establish a joint company with a capital of 8 million yuan, to purchase the Krupp Company's direct steelmaking method. At the same time, it was decided to add the bill on handling poor ore to the Iron and Steel Industry Act in this Diet session. Iron and steel manufacturers who use sand iron from poor mining areas as raw materials will be exempt from taxes. (Twenty-first Allied Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Unifies Foreign Communications Agencies</h3>
<p>Radio Company Decides to Merge - China and Japan to Implement Transmission of Photos</p>
<p>[Tokyo] In order to unify foreign communication agencies, the government has been preparing to merge Japan Radio and International Telephone companies. On the 20th, the Cabinet decided to submit the amendment to the Japan Radio Co., Ltd. Act regarding the merger to this Diet session. The name of the new company is tentatively set as International Electrical Communication Co., Ltd. Currently, Japan has 22 direct wireless communication lines and 7 international telephone lines. After the government unifies and expands the wireless communication agencies, it will establish wireless communication with Australia, Hong Kong, and Egypt, as well as international telephone communication with British India, Siam, and Argentina. It will also implement the transmission of photos between Europe, the United States, and China. (Twenty-first Allied Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Christians to Send Representatives to China</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The All-China Christian General Federation recently sent a letter to the Japan Christian Federation, requesting that representatives be sent to China to connect Sino-Japanese friendship.

The letter from China this time is a response to this. The Japan General Federation authorities have decided to send several religious representatives to China. (Twenty-first Allied Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Naval Budget Exceeds £100 Million</h3>
<p>Ten New Ships to be Built This Year, with Emphasis on Enhancing Air Defense Capabilities</p>
<p>[London] It is expected that this year's British naval budget will exceed £100 million, an unprecedented figure in British history. This is because three new battleships and seven new cruisers will be built this year. The Naval Defence Act of 1889 also stipulated an expenditure of £100 million, but it was spread over several years. The estimate stipulated in the 1937 budget is limited to one fiscal year. Naval experts claim that the huge total this year is not entirely due to the significant increase in shipbuilding costs. A larger portion is attributed to increased storage of ammunition and fuel, as well as the expenses required to strengthen naval air power. In addition, a portion of the funds will be allocated to extensively modernizing existing cruisers, with a particular focus on enhancing the armor protection and anti-aircraft defense capabilities of these ships. The three proposed battleships will each cost £8 million to build, slightly more than the "Nelson" and "Rodney" ships. This is because the cost per ton in 1925 was £176, but now it is £200.

<h3>Major Reshuffle of High-Ranking U.S. Naval Officers</h3>
<p>Bomb Incident on Battleship; Naval Department Launches Investigation</p>
<p>[Washington] While the investigation into the bomb incident on the battleship "Wyoming" is still underway, the Naval Department suddenly announced a reshuffle of high-ranking officers. It is claimed that this reshuffle is unrelated to the bomb incident. However, given that as many as 23 admirals, commanders, and lieutenants are being transferred, astute observers believe that Rear Admiral Leahy, the Chief of Naval Personnel, intends to ensure that the commanders of various fleets reach the highest possible level of efficiency within the next two years. Those not being transferred include Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the Asiatic Fleet, and Admiral Bloch, Commander of the Battle Force.

<h3>Supreme Council of the Italian Fascist Party</h3>
<p>To Convene on the First of Next Month to Discuss National Defense Plans</p>
<p>[Rome] The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party is now scheduled to meet on March 1st. At that time, it will study the various needs of national defense and, citing the military expansion of the "Three Major Democratic Countries" (Britain, France, and the United States), decide to expand armaments. Local newspapers are currently commenting on the various military installations in these countries. For example, "Il Popolo d'Italia" stated, "Newspapers and politicians in the three major democratic countries now believe that the arms race among various countries is attributable to authoritarian regimes. Can the people believe this?" Corriere della Sera stated, "The military buildup of the three major democratic countries, as a matter of course, will make war inevitable. The hypocrisy of Puritanism and the dreams of democracy are enough to endanger world civilization, more so than ever before." (Havas News Agency, 20th)</p>
<h3>Unrest in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Assassination Attempt on Italian Governor-General: A Clear Indication</p>
<p>[London] Italian Governor-General of Abyssinia, Marshal Graziani, was attacked by natives in Addis Ababa yesterday noon, suffering minor injuries. After this news reached Britain, responsible individuals commented that British sources had repeatedly received reliable private information stating that the situation in Abyssinia remained unstable. The railway line from Addis Ababa to the French port of Djibouti was frequently attacked. Even the residents of Addis Ababa were uneasy at night. The assassination attempt on Marshal Graziani proves this. However, political figures do not wish to exploit this situation to re-adopt a policy of supporting Abyssinian independence, which would increase Italy's difficulties. Instead, they believe that the League of Nations should quickly recognize Italy's sovereignty over Abyssinia, so that the issue of how to address the credentials of ambassadors to Italy (referring to whether to address the Italian king as "His Majesty the King of Italy" or "His Majesty the Emperor of Abyssinia") can be resolved. As for Italy, it should concentrate its efforts on pacifying Abyssinia and abandon its opportunistic policies in Spain. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Following the assassination attempt on Italian Governor-General of Abyssinia, Marshal Graziani, yesterday, Chancellor Hitler telegraphed Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to express his indignation and wish the Marshal a speedy recovery. (Havas News Agency, 20th)</p>

<h3>New U.S. Neutrality Law</h3>
<p>Contains Seven Key Points; Passed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee</p>
<p>[Washington] The new neutrality bill introduced by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was passed by the committee yesterday.

<h3>Hoover Opposes Judicial Reform</h3>
<p>Strongly Criticizes Roosevelt</p>
<p>Chicago Former President Hoover delivered a speech to a thousand members of the Associated Press Club here, formally attacking President Roosevelt's plan to reform the judicial system for the first time. He stated that the Supreme Court is the guarantee of the people's freedom, so disrupting it would harm the people's freedom. "The President's proposal is the most important constitutional issue in seventy years. I speak today not as a Republican, but as an American who has witnessed the freedom of people in other countries being destroyed, so I must speak out." Hoover added that the current point of contention is whether the President can freely amend the Constitution, or whether such amendments should be submitted to a vote by all the people. As for the President's claim that increasing the number of Supreme Court justices would speed up the court's handling of cases, Hoover believes that it is unnecessary, because according to the Department of Justice's report, the Supreme Court has no backlog of cases.

<h3>27 Nations Prohibit Volunteers from Joining the Spanish Conflict</h3>
<p>French Border Sealed; Arms Embargo Takes Effect Next Month</p>
<p>[London] The ban on volunteers from various countries entering Spain to fight took effect at midnight yesterday, coinciding with the start of the eighth month since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. A total of 27 countries have joined the Non-Intervention Committee's agreement. Its success is largely due to Britain's independent efforts to engage with major powers and persuade Germany and Italy not to insist on the prior withdrawal of volunteers already in Spain. The immediate task of the Non-Intervention Committee is to prevent arms from being transported into Spain by sea or through Portugal. Britain believes that there is a very good chance of overcoming this difficulty. The arms embargo will take effect on March 6th, and it is expected that the Spanish Civil War will be shortened as a result. Furthermore, the Portuguese government has issued an order to implement the ban on volunteers, requiring Portuguese citizens who have gone to Spain to fight to return to the country within a month. At the same time, it issued a declaration explaining the government's reasons for opposing the imprisonment plan advocated by the Non-Intervention Committee and stated that, at the recommendation of friendly nations and considering the difficulties it would cause, the Portuguese government has informed the British government that it is willing to have the fulfillment of Portugal's obligations verified by monitoring personnel attached to the British ambassador.

<h3>Spanish Government Forces Switch from Defense to Offense</h3>
<p>Advances on the Southern Front of Madrid</p>
<p>Madrid Government artillery shelled the village of Viveros on the Jarama front tonight, claiming that the rebel headquarters was planning another attack on Madrid in that village. At the same time, the rebels also heavily attacked Beleras near the northern side of the capital. There was street fighting in the Marañoso neighborhood. Government forces have stormed into the heavily guarded rebel lines, capturing part of the town and dispersing the rebels. The Madrid Defense Committee announced today that government forces, led by tanks and the Asturian dynamite squad, have been making steady progress. It also stated that the road from Madrid to Valencia remains in the hands of the government forces. The government has today begun to regulate the capital's food supply, ordering residents to report hoarders. Casualties from street fighting in Marañoso are expected to reach several thousand. It is claimed that the rebels have prepared a second line of defense four miles outside the town. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>Madrid Government forces have continued to launch offensives in the area of the Arganda Bridge (on the Jarama River) southeast of the city, achieving considerable success. By 5:00 PM, they had captured several highlands and controlled the town of Vaciamadrid, located near the highway connecting the capital to Valencia.

Government forces constantly bombarded the areas where Nationalist reinforcements were concentrated, preventing them from advancing. (Havas News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Madrid General Miaja, leader of the Spanish government forces' defense committee, declared to visitors that government forces have halted the rebel offensive. Miaja also stated, "We are not only on the offensive, but we have also forced the enemy to fight at locations favorable to government forces." According to Miaja, the reason the government has been able to switch from defense to offense is that the military in Madrid has been unified and is dynamic. Miaja added that the rebels in the Jarama River valley are using the latest weapons to try to encircle Madrid, cutting off food supplies and forcing it to surrender, but government forces have unexpectedly forced them to retreat. "I now assure the world that the Republicans will be victorious." General Miaja admitted the difficulty of the food situation in Madrid, but that although the people there cannot eat their fill, they have not all starved to death. (Reuters News Agency via Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Almería, Southern City Southern government forces launched an offensive yesterday towards the area of Cadiz in the central Granada province. Our special correspondent happened to be inspecting the front at the time and was able to witness the battle. It is claimed that after government forces charged towards the Nationalist positions with hand grenades, the Nationalist forces resisted for a time but were ultimately unable to withstand the pressure and retreated in disarray, abandoning a large number of military supplies. Government forces captured two cannons, many machine guns, and a batch of hand grenades. In addition, government forces have occupied most of the strategic locations in the Alpujarras Mountains of that province, thereby controlling the Nationalist positions in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and the traffic arteries leading from there to the coast. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Ávila Spanish government forces repeatedly launched counter-attacks between Las Rozas and Casatejada, northwest of Madrid, attempting to break through the Nationalist lines.

The government forces launched a third attack in the afternoon, but scattered when the Nationalist forces charged. Nationalist forces launched an assault on the Aragon front at 5:00 AM this morning and are currently celebrating their victory. It is said that the Nationalist forces have failed to occupy the village of Villel, near their objective.

<h3>Memorial to Fallen Soldiers of WWI; German Minister Long Speaks</h3>
<p>Unite National Strength; Continue the Anti-Communist Struggle</p>
<p>[Berlin] Today is Remembrance Day for the fallen heroes of World War I. Hitler and Defense Minister General von Blomberg inspected troops and delegations of veterans and disabled veterans in front of the monument to the fallen soldiers. General von Blomberg delivered a speech praising the achievements of the National Socialist Party, stating, "Chancellor Hitler's policies are to unite the national strength domestically and maintain international peace abroad. Although Germany has experienced such deep suffering, humiliation, and shame, it still extends a hand of friendship to all nations. The value of this spirit should be understood by all allied nations. The Treaty of Versailles was imposed on Germany by force and accepted under duress. Its revision has greatly benefited the cause of world peace. This should be understood by the world. Germany has no desire to infringe upon the freedom of other nations in the world, but fighting against Bolshevism is our legitimate action. This should also be understood by the world." Von Blomberg continued, "National Socialism is founded on the German Wehrmacht. The Wehrmacht and National Socialism are integrated and inseparable. Through its diligent struggles, Germany has now gained complete autonomy. From now on, what we must continue to strive for is to consolidate the positions we have already occupied. The purpose of the Four-Year Plan lies in this. In short, we must always be loyal to our leader, Hitler. We have shared adversity with the leader, and we should also share prosperity with the leader." (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister Visits Vienna</h3>
<p>Topics of Discussion Limited to Two</p>
<p>[Vienna] German Foreign Minister Neurath is scheduled to visit tomorrow and will hold talks with Austrian authorities. Responsible individuals believe that the main issues of discussion will be limited to two: ㊀ Cooperation between the National Socialist Party and the Austrian government, and ㊁ The issue of the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy. Austria's attitude towards these two issues can be discerned from the following facts: ㊀ The government still considers shouting "Heil Hitler" by National Socialist Party members within its borders to be an act of treason. This is Austria's attitude towards the first issue. ㊁ Chancellor Schuschnigg recently gave a speech at the Council of State to leaders of patriotic fronts in various regions, stating that whether or not to restore the Habsburg monarchy is an internal matter that only the Austrian people can decide. This is Austria's attitude towards the second issue. Responsible individuals also fear that National Socialist Party members may cause trouble after Neurath arrives. It is rumored that thousands of National Socialist Party members have prepared to line the streets to welcome Neurath and shout "Heil Hitler" at him. Therefore, Minister of Public Security Stummer has secretly ordered the Mayor of Vienna and the Police Chief to take extra precautions on the 22nd and 23rd to maintain public order. In addition, semi-official newspapers have recently reported that the German government's attitude towards Catholicism remains a major obstacle to a comprehensive resolution of German-Austrian relations. However, it is believed that Neurath's visit comes at a time when the international situation is easing, so it is hoped that German and Austrian authorities will be able to meet frankly to promote bilateral relations. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Austria, officials here have expressed satisfaction, believing that it is the first time in the past six years that a senior German government official has formally visited "the capital of another Germanic nation." It is said that the only two issues that the Foreign Minister will discuss with Austrian authorities are the stabilization of the domestic situation in Austria and the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy. Regarding the former, the Austrian government will allow all constructive forces within the country to cooperate with the government in order to stabilize the overall situation. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Austria, Le Temps recently published an article by renowned journalist Madame Tabouis, commenting that "The Austrian government has already resolved not to engage in verbal discussions with the German government on the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy at this time. As for Neurath himself, even if he expresses his opinion on this issue, it will be very circumspect. Furthermore, according to reports, after the German-Austrian agreement was concluded last November, two key figures in Austria who were inclined towards National Socialism were added to the Schuschnigg cabinet. One is Taucher, the current Minister of Commerce, and the other is Gleispach, the current Minister of the Interior. There have recently been rumors that the positions of these two men may be shaken. It is expected that Neurath will insist to the Austrian government on retaining these two men in the cabinet during his visit to Vienna. As for the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy, the Austrian government is currently eagerly awaiting a decision after Chancellor Schuschnigg meets with Italian authorities in Rome during the first week of next month."

<h3>Czechoslovakia Concedes to German Minority</h3>
<p>Germans Still Express Dissatisfaction; Demand Absolute Equality</p>
<p>[Berlin] According to a commentary from a prominent German critic, Germany is dissatisfied with the recent concessions made by the Czechoslovakian government to its minorities regarding the 3 million Germans within Czechoslovakian territory, but acknowledges that it is a step forward on the right path. The ultimate goal should be absolute equality between the Czech and German peoples. The conditions for the Czechoslovakian government's concessions to its domestic minorities include the increased employment of Germans in factories and public service, and the increased use of the German language in writing. (Reuters News Agency via Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Prague, Czechoslovakian Capital Among the various Czechoslovakian political parties, there are three parties that participate in the cabinet that are dedicated to activities for the German minority: "The Social Democratic Party, the Agrarian Party, and the Christian Social Party. These three parties are all referred to as the German National Action Party." The government has recently agreed with these parties on the following measures: ㊀ In areas inhabited by the German minority, public works projects should be undertaken by German contractors and German workers. ㊁ 20% of government civil service appointments should be filled by German nationals. ㊂ Government subsidies for German theaters, cultural organizations, impoverished children, and scholarships should be increased. ㊃ For German-inhabited villages and towns with a population of less than 3,000, the central government should issue decrees in German. Regarding the above compromise, the "Prager Tagblatt" recently stated, "The Czechoslovakian government's policy towards domestic minorities has always been one of equality. This is clearly demonstrated. Furthermore, the government's cooperation with German minorities, such as the fact that there are three cabinet members who are German nationals, has now been effective."

<p>The Liberal Party Asks the Government to Swiftly Curb Disorder</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania – A special meeting was recently held in the capital by Liberal Party cabinet members, speakers of both houses of parliament, and other leading figures of the Liberal faction. Liberal Party leader Mr. Bratianu expressed his opinion that extreme right-wing groups are now using illegal means to conspire to endanger the foundation of the nation and undermine the authority of the government. He believes that the government must take urgent action to resolutely curb them. It is generally believed that the government agrees entirely with Mr. Bratianu's views on this matter and will take significant decisions to curb the nascent disorder. In addition, many Liberal Party members of Congress have recently jointly sent a letter to Prime Minister Tătărescu. Political figures have commented extensively on the points raised in the letter. The letter stated in essence that Romania's civil system is currently under serious attack, and the pro-civilian political parties are now devoid of vitality and do not consider self-rejuvenation. "The general impression is that Romania's civil system is nearing its end and is moving towards a right-wing dictatorship. The government and the Liberal Party should bear responsibility for this situation and should immediately decide on measures to restore the government's authority," etc. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army in North China to Implement Rotation of Troops Early Next Month</h3>
<p>Newly Recruited Troops Arrive in China for Training; Purchasing Land in Fengtai to Build New Barracks</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Japanese troops stationed in North China are due for a partial rotation, scheduled to take place on March 2nd. More than 600 new soldiers arrived at Qinhuangdao on February 28th aboard the army-chartered ship Ikoma-maru. On the same day, they transferred to the Pingyu train and arrived in Tianjin and Beijing, where they were stationed at the Li Mingzhuang, Pingdong, and Jiaominxiang barracks in Tianjin, taking over from the more than 300 troops being rotated out. The outgoing troops left their posts on the same day and traveled to Qin Island, where they boarded a ship back to their home country. Among the new troops arriving this time, more than 300 are newly recruited, and according to past practice, newly recruited troops must undergo six months of military training in their home country before being sent here. Now, however, this precedent has been broken, and they have been sent directly to North China after being recruited, where they will be incorporated into the ranks and trained in the field. In terms of numbers, these new recruits are not included in the rotation quota, so in reality, it is equivalent to an increase in troops. The first batch arrived on March 1st, and there will be two or three more batches later, arriving around mid-March and early April. Due to the increase in Japanese troops in North China, the Tianjin Japanese Army Headquarters has proposed expanding the Fengyi barracks. They previously entrusted someone to purchase more than 1,000 mu of civilian land near the Lugou Bridge in Fengyi to be used for the new barracks. The Hebei-Chahar authorities, in light of the previous example of the Japanese army purchasing land in Li Mingzhuang on the outskirts of Tianjin last year, believe that once the Japanese barracks are successfully built, they will not only have a threatening and controlling effect on us, but also nearby farmland will not be cultivated in a timely manner. Therefore, they specifically instructed Wang Lengzhai, the commissioner of Wanping, to negotiate with the Japanese side to stop it. Although this matter has become a thing of the past, the Ministry of the Army has already sent the land price, and the North China Garrison Army Headquarters believes that this is an urgent matter that must be handled. They have negotiated with Mr. Song Zheyuan several times, but due to conflicting opinions, they are unhappy with each other. Despite their unhappiness, they are trying to purchase land through other means and are becoming increasingly eager to realize their plan. Therefore, recently, they may use the method of expanding the border by the puppet organization in eastern Hebei to transfer the land to the Japanese side.</p>
<p>With the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet and the change of the Minister of the Army, there will be changes in the diplomacy towards North China, and even the implementation methods of economic cooperation may differ from before. Mr. Tashiro, the commander of the Japanese Garrison Army in China, specifically sent Lieutenant Colonel Ikeda, the third section chief in charge of economic affairs, back to his home country during the Spring Festival to report and ask for instructions. Ikeda returned to Tianjin on the 19th to report back. The military headquarters also believes that some Japanese residents in Tianjin and Beijing feel that business and economic decline in recent years have been affected by the unstable political situation in North China, and most of them regard it as a direct negative impression given to the people of North China after the increase in garrison troops. It is believed that the annual expenditure of more than 18 million yuan for the garrison troops only increases the burden on the people, and that apart from the abnormal and improper development of smuggling merchants in trade with China, legitimate merchants are all trapped in a dead end. If China has strict measures against smuggling, then the future of Japanese merchants will be even more bleak. Therefore, it is felt that stabilizing the economic market in North China and promoting legitimate Japanese trade is an urgent task. To stabilize the market, it is necessary to calm people's hearts, and the stationing of a large number of troops is really unnecessary. It is appropriate to reduce them appropriately to ease the burden on the Japanese people and avoid panic among the people of North China. This movement has now reached Tokyo. As Mr. Tashiro and Lu Cheng have seen the facts, they ordered Lieutenant Colonel Kazuchi, the second section chief, to fly back to Tokyo on the 20th to report to the military headquarters again and to try to eliminate the previous movement. According to information obtained here, there will be major changes in the Japanese Army's regular transfer of personnel in March, from the commander to the senior staff of the North China Garrison Army Headquarters. Mr. Tashiro will be transferred to the commander of the 2nd Infantry Division in Sendai, Okamura Neiji (one theory is that Tashiro will be transferred to another position, and Okamura will be transferred to the commander of the North China Garrison Army, and the vacant position will be succeeded by Itagaki, the chief of staff of the Kwantung Army). Okamura once served as the deputy chief of staff of the Kwantung Army and was the signatory of the Tanggu Agreement. His sophisticated skills are well-known among the younger generation of Japanese soldiers. If he is transferred to North China, we should pay close attention to his actions. (19th)</p>
<h3>Baoshan</h3>
<p>Organizing Labor Camps for Opium Addicts</p>
<p>Zhang Mingjing, the county magistrate of Shishi County, believes that imprisoning opium addicts who are serving short-term sentences wastes prison food and weakens the vitality of the prisoners, which is not in line with the country's policy of caring for prisoners and administering prisons cautiously. In order to save public resources and improve the physical and mental health of prisoners, he has now followed the methods promulgated by the province and consulted local conditions to formulate the "Organizational Regulations for the Baoshan County Labor Camp for Opium Addicts" and is engaging in the organization of labor camps, so that each opium addict can exercise his body while in prison, do his best, and engage in various construction works. It is reported that the registration of opium addicts' names has begun, and their work skills are being solicited, and the organization is being started. The work items include dredging rivers, building roads, repairing ponds, cleaning roads, and planting trees, etc., and military training is carried out for one hour every day, and spiritual talks are given for one hour, in order to implement both labor and education, increase their personality cultivation, and construct ideas. Opium addicts who are generally mired in darkness have received this gospel, and they are all rejoicing and encouraged, so the number of people who have signed up recently is very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Yuan Guifang opened a gambling den in Yuanjiazhai, Loudang Town, Fifth District. The Loudang Police Station sent four police officers to arrest them. More than thirty gamblers gathered to resist arrest and violently beat the police officer Chen Yueqing, injuring his right body, hands, waist, legs, and other parts.

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Strange Warship Fires at Baimaokou</p>
<p>The police station here received a report from the Baimao sub-station, saying that at 5:30 pm yesterday (the 20th), a warship of a certain country was discovered in the middle of the river more than 20 miles off the coast of Baimaokou, firing machine guns at the shore for about ten minutes before stopping. The residents of the town were terrified when they heard the sound. The sub-station immediately sent police to patrol along the river, but due to the heavy fog, it was impossible to distinguish the number of ships and flags. They stayed in the river until late at night and did not leave. Therefore, Wang Xiongji, the patrol officer of the police sub-station, urgently telegraphed the general station for instructions. According to this year, warships of a certain country have repeatedly been found harassing the Jiangbin area of Changtai, and our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has protested to the Japanese consulate. Now, it has happened again with unclear intentions.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Strictly Pursuing New and Old Land Taxes</p>
<p>The arrears of old taxes in this county from the 16th to the 24th year of the Republic of China totaled more than one million yuan. Although the county government urged them to be collected tightly, the effect was very small, and only more than 300,000 yuan were collected. After the Lantern Festival, the collection will continue. The quota for the new tax in the 25th year of the Republic of China is one million yuan, which is collected in two phases. The first phase is to collect 40%, and the collection is quite good (about 300,000 yuan). The second phase is to collect 60%, and the collection is not as good as the previous phase (also about 300,000 yuan). Recently, County Magistrate Long first paid 170,000 yuan in taxes to the province, and at the same time ordered tax collectors to go to the countryside to urge collection. Those who refuse to pay will be arrested and sent to the county for forced collection. It is reported that the first phase of the land tax for the 26th year of the Republic of China is scheduled to be collected in July.</p>
<p>Recovering City and Township Shop and House Donations</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Province collects house donations, which are divided into shop and house donations. The collection range is limited to towns and cities with police agencies and streets with more than 100 households. The county government collects local donations and sends staff to collect them directly on a monthly basis. In this county, only shop donations are collected. The tax rate is 10% per month. The urban area collects about 6,000 yuan per month, and the rural area collects about 1,000 yuan per month. In the past, it was used for police expenses, but now it is handed over to the treasury for unified collection and expenditure. However, the arrears of this donation have reached more than 10,000 yuan. The collection office has ordered two collectors to start collecting them completely within two months. Those who fail to pay within the time limit will be charged a late payment fine.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Villagers Resist Arrest for Gambling</p>
<p>According to a secret report from the Wuyi County Police Bureau, a play was performed in Tangqiao Town, Sixth District, on the 19th, and there were also gatherings for gambling. The security team deputy captain Miao Gan, the detective team leader Chen Sendu, and more than 20 team members and detectives were sent by boat to investigate and arrest them. Captain Miao and others arrested a gambling boss named Jiang Zhenghuan in the First Xuan Tea Shop. When other gamblers were being rounded up, suddenly, local ruffians and most of the villagers beat drums and gathered crowds, shouting fire, causing great chaos. Captain Miao and others were surrounded, and the gambling boss Jiang Zhenghuan was rescued and escaped. Nine gamblers, including Qian Xisheng, were taken to the town government along with gambling tools, etc., but the rioters surrounded the town government again. After finding the town chief to maintain order, the nine gamblers were finally taken to the city bureau at night. After interrogation by the Case Section Chief on the 20th, they were sent to the local court for trial.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Qingchang Petroleum Station Robbed</p>
<p>At about 7 pm on the 19th, three bandits suddenly came to the Nongchang Petroleum Station in Longtouguan in the city, and under the pretext of delivering goods, they opened the gate of the station and entered. After entering, they took out pistols and drove all nine employees of the station to one place. Then they searched extensively and robbed more than eighty yuan in paper money and foreign currency. They also shot and killed Xi Erning, a coolie carrying cigarettes. The bullet entered from the corner of his forehead. The bandits fled with blood stains. The police immediately reported to the police Fourth Precinct and the police bureau's detective team, who led police detectives to hunt them down, but the bandits had already fled far away. Xi Erning, who was killed, had been inspected by personnel from the local procuratorate, who ordered that a coffin be prepared for him to be buried temporarily in a nearby temple. His wife was also notified to come to the city to take care of the arrangements. It is reported that the deceased left behind a son and a daughter, who are very young and from a very poor family.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Construction General Station</p>
<p>The Qiantang River Bridge will be completed by the end of June. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Hubei-Hunan Railways will then implement joint transportation. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway takes Hangzhou as an important place to connect with the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. A request has been made to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to allow the requisition of civilian land at Houchaomen to build the Hangzhou General Station, and about 300 acres of land are needed for the construction of a freight yard in the area from Wangjiangmen to Fengshanmen. As soon as the procedures for requisition and price payment are completed, merchants can be recruited to undertake the construction by the end of next month.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>Grain Industry Storm Subsides</p>
<p>Bengbu's grain industry has always been large-scale. Agricultural products from eastern Henan and northern Anhui are mostly transported to Bengbu for sale. Therefore, grain boats gather on the Huai River, forming a grain market. There are no fewer than 80 grain firms in the whole port that act as intermediaries, and there are more than 1,000 employees who directly buy and sell on behalf of customers. The composition of the members is complex, and the quality varies. Unscrupulous people often use their names to swindle and cheat. Last year, there were eight or nine cases of employees defrauding money in the river. The river police bureau and the grain industry association believe that the order is chaotic and should be rectified urgently. Unscrupulous elements will be strictly banned. Therefore, after a joint meeting, it was decided that the grain industry association would issue flags to each firm and badges to employees. All employees going down the river must wear badges and hang the firm's flag on the boat for identification. Since the implementation of the unified system, the order has been orderly. A Ningxing flour mill recently sent personnel down the river, but because the trademark flag on the boat was not approved by the water police bureau, it was detained. A few frustrated employees encouraged it and fabricated rumors, and there was invisible work stoppage, which led to a Phoenix tide. On the morning of the 19th, armed police officers were sent by the land and water police bureaus to set up security in the area of Weitang Road in the river to prevent riots. The person in charge of the grain industry association came forward to mediate, and the Ning brand flag was returned by the water police bureau. All employees continued to work in accordance with the regulations. The uproar subsided.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Hongxing Ship Collides with Ferry</p>
<p>Ren Gan'alian, a villager in the Lianjia Township of Zhenhai First District, has been making a living by rowing a ferry on the Qingshui River. On the early morning of the 18th, A'lian was carrying a Yunfeng passenger across the river when the Xin Hongyu ship suddenly came head-on. A'lian could not avoid it, and with a sudden sound, the boat split in half. The ferryman and passengers all fell into the water. Other ferries heard the sound and rushed to rescue them. The passengers were all safe, but the boatman Tu A'lian could not be rescued. When he floated up, he was already dead. His wife rushed to the scene to put on his clothes and asked the shipping company for condolences and a coffin.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Rickshaw Trade Association Announces the Content of a One-Year Rickshaw Puller Literacy Education Program</h3>
<p>The Special District Office of the Municipal Rickshaw Trade Association, to request the Public Works Department to extend the period for reducing rickshaws, and to discuss the equitable sharing of losses and handling of the aftermath of the reduction of rickshaws, convened a general meeting of rickshaw owners at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 20th of this month. Regarding the second item on the agenda, "The Bureau of Social Affairs has instructed that, starting from March, a one-year rickshaw puller literacy education program should be organized, with each rickshaw bearing a monthly expense of 30 cents," it was resolved that rickshaw owners were already burdened with a mutual aid fee of $1.50 per rickshaw, making it difficult to handle this new expense, and it was decided to send representatives to petition the authorities. This has been reported in various newspapers. The responsible committee members of the trade association have specifically announced the process and content of the literacy education program as follows: The Establishment of Rickshaw Puller Literacy Education. The association convened the third session of its members assembly on June 26th last year in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. One of the motions was related to the organization of rickshaw pullers relief matters, and was resolved to be handled by the Executive Committee. On July 12th, the second Executive Committee meeting, based on the letter from Zhang Mingzhi and others organizing the Rickshaw Puller Welfare Association, resolved that the rickshaw owners would organize themselves and appointed Shao An, Qin Yizhou, Gu Songmao, Ni Yuebo, Wang Kunyi, Zhu Zhishan, Fan Jinbiao, Yuan Dehua, Wang Yanxiu, Zhou Jinting, and Li Shuncai as preparation committee members, who would be responsible for carrying out the activities. Subsequently, due to the broad scope of the Rickshaw Puller Welfare Association, it was renamed the Rickshaw Puller Relief Undertaking Department. It formulated twelve articles of organizational regulations, stipulating that the scope of the undertaking would include rickshaw puller education, education for rickshaw pullers' children, etc., with expenses to be covered by a monthly payment of thirty cents from vehicles in the north and south city special districts that were members of the association, etc. This was reviewed and approved by the third Executive Committee meeting on July 18th, and submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs for approval. The relevant department of the Bureau of Social Affairs considered literacy education to be important, and other undertakings could be temporarily delayed. After literacy education was implemented, other undertakings could be gradually carried out. The association considered the relief of rickshaw pullers to be a matter of urgency, and drafted a one-year rickshaw puller literacy education plan and submitted it for approval. The Bureau of Social Affairs convened talks on several occasions, and the association repeatedly sent staff to request prompt approval so that it could be implemented as soon as possible. On February 16th of this year, the association received Instruction No. 3610 from the Bureau of Social Affairs, which stated: "After investigation, the one-year rickshaw puller literacy education plan in this city has been submitted to the Municipal Government and approved under Instruction No. 22592. In addition to requesting the Bureau of Finance to collect Shanghai Bank's fee receipts for all public rickshaw donations and licenses starting from March, in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of the plan, this order is hereby issued for compliance. Furthermore, the plan was originally intended to be implemented from February, but this is no longer feasible and should be changed to March 1st of this year. This order, etc., is being prepared for implementation. The rickshaw owners' general meeting of the special district office had this proposal. At that time, many responsible committee members participating in this education plan did not explain or correct the situation, which was a bit negligent. Because the trade association's bi-annual members' assembly's motions have been passed with the supervision of party and government representatives, the Executive Committee can only comply, and should not change this easily. Moreover, it has been repeatedly submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Municipal Government for approval. If we go back on our word, it will not only affect our credibility, but also make it difficult for the association to seek government assistance in the future. Regarding the statement that paying the Public Works Department's mutual aid fee of $1.50 already makes it difficult to bear the expense, the reason is not sufficient. At a time when the city treasury is strained and rickshaw puller welfare matters are numerous, we should strive to promote it in order to achieve the goal of replacing the mutual aid association presided over by the authorities of the Concession. This is to repay the government's past efforts in promoting our rickshaw industry. Therefore, the association will adhere to the original plan and resolutely proceed without changing due to the unreasonable opposition of a very small number of people. The One-Year Rickshaw Puller Literacy Education Plan includes the following: 1. The association formulates this plan in the spirit of mutual benefit between labor and management, and to improve the knowledge and living conditions of rickshaw pullers. 2. All rickshaw pullers in this city, except those who are already literate and have passed the examination, and those who are over 45 years of age, should be subject to compulsory literacy education. 3. This plan will be implemented from February 1, 1937, and will be completed within one year. 4. There are approximately 90,000 rickshaw pullers in this city. Excluding those who are already literate and older rickshaw pullers who can be exempted from education, there are approximately 65,000 who actually need education. 5. This plan will establish 65 rickshaw puller literacy schools in the residential areas of rickshaw pullers. Each school will have five classes, and each class will enroll 50 rickshaw pullers. They will graduate in three months, meaning that 16,250 people can graduate every three months. It will be completed in twelve months. If necessary, the period will be extended appropriately. 6. The budget is as follows: A. Recurring Expenses - $62,400 yuan: (1) Teacher salaries: $36 yuan per person per month, $28,080 yuan per year; (2) Worker salaries: $12 yuan per school per month, $9,360 yuan per year; (3) Office expenses (including stationery, water, electricity, and miscellaneous expenses): $12 yuan per school per month, $9,360 yuan per year; (4) Rent: $20 yuan per school per month, $15,600 yuan per year; B. Start-up Expenses - $4,420 yuan: (5) Desks and chairs (four people sharing one set): 15 sets per school, $4 yuan per set, totaling $3,900 yuan; (6) Blackboards and other equipment: $8 yuan per school, totaling $520 yuan; C. Contingency Expenses - $982.40 yuan. The total is $67,802.40 yuan. 7. The expenses required for this plan will be borne by rickshaw owners and calculated according to the number of rickshaws owned, initially for one year. 8. The collection of the aforementioned expenses will be handled by a bank designated by the trade association. When donating permits monthly, the Bureau of Social Affairs will request the Bureau of Finance to inspect the bank receipt, otherwise the permit will be withheld. 9. The aforementioned expenses will be managed by a management committee composed of one representative from the Chamber of Commerce and five representatives from rickshaw owners. 10. The implementation of this plan will be handled by a Shanghai Rickshaw Puller Literacy Education Committee composed of five members elected by the Executive Committee of the trade association. A secretary-general will be appointed by the trade association, who will be an experienced educator. Office staff may be hired as needed based on actual requirements. 11. This plan will be implemented after being passed by the Executive Committee of the Rickshaw Trade Association and approved by the Bureau of Social Affairs. 12. If there are any matters not covered in this plan, the Executive Committee of the Trade Association will report them to the Bureau of Social Affairs for revision.</p>

<h3>Tonight's Ping Pong Match: Jinling vs. Langya</h3>
<p>Jinling Wins Successively</p>
<p>The Wuxi Jinling Ping Pong Team, on its second day in Shanghai yesterday, played its first match at 7:00 PM against the Huafeng team, which had previously won the Junior Cup. Jinling won with a score of 5-2. The second match was originally scheduled between Jinling and Guangdong, but due to an insufficient number of players, it was temporarily canceled. Instead, a friendly match was held with the Customs team, which included famous players such as Deng Guofu. Jinling won again with a score of 6-0, resulting in a record of two wins out of three matches. Tonight at 7:00 PM, Jinling will play against the Telegraph Bureau team, and at 8:30 PM against the Shanghai champion Langya team. The Telegraph Bureau team includes Yao Guanfan, Lang Depei, and Wang Zhongheng, and has strong strength. The Langya team consists entirely of top-notch players in Shanghai and will field its strongest lineup against Jinling today. Therefore, Jinling's chances of retaining the Ti'an Cup are slim.

Braddock and Detroit African-American boxer Joe Louis signed a contract today, scheduling a championship match for June 22nd at Comiskey Park baseball stadium, with a scheduled 15 rounds. This action cancels the original plan for Schmeling entirely. Schmeling had previously defeated Joe Louis, and the New York State Athletic Commission had recognized Schmeling as the primary challenger to Braddock. Schmeling was confident of victory, and Braddock had even signed a contract with Schmeling, preparing to fight Joe Louis after defeating Schmeling. However, after signing this new contract, if Joe Louis wins the championship, Schmeling would have to fight Joe Louis as a challenger, which would greatly diminish his prestige. It is currently unknown how Madison Square Garden Corporation President Kilpatrick will protect Braddock's contract with Schmeling's rights. However, if Braddock signed this contract today without the permission of the Madison Square Garden Corporation, they will attempt to issue an injunction to prohibit this match. According to Braddock's manager, Joe Gould, the main reason Braddock is unwilling to fight Schmeling and willing to fight Joe Louis is that a match between Braddock and Schmeling would risk triggering an anti-National Socialist boycott. Alvin Johnson, president of the Non-Sectarian Anti-Nazi League to Champion Human Rights, recently warned Braddock's promoters, Jack Corbb of the Twentieth Century Boxing Club and Johnston of Madison Square Garden, that if they did not stop this match, they would boycott any future actions by those two groups. According to New York sports writers, this boycott would have a significant impact on revenue. Jews make up 3.58% of the US population and are sympathetic to the Anti-Nazi League. Jews make up 16.67% of the New York State population and 29.56% of the New York City population (the location of the Braddock vs. Schmeling match). Furthermore, Jews make up the majority of the audience at matches in New York City, so a boycott would significantly affect revenue. Joe Gould said that he allowed the Braddock-Louis match because it was fair. This match could generate $1 million in ticket sales, but a Braddock-Schmeling match would only generate $200,000 in revenue.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Grain in Extraordinary Times (Continued from Issue 213)</h3>
<p>— Qiu Bincun</p>
<p>The shortage of grain in Guangdong Province is indeed an undeniable fact, but the surplus grain in other provinces can be used to supply us. I believe that there are four steps to passively regulate grain:</p>
<p>(1) Injecting neighboring provinces to manage people's food: There is an ancient saying that "If Hubei and Hunan are abundant, the world is abundant," which shows that there is a surplus of grain there. The province needs certain amount of grain every year in addition to local production, and grain can be purchased from surplus provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, Anhui, and Jiangxi. Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hunan have waterways that can be used to transport goods, and there is originally no problem with transportation. Recently, the Han-Guangdong train has been opened, and agricultural products from Hunan and Hubei can be transported by land, which is equivalent to us having a warehouse in a neighboring province. Recently, the provincial government and the people have cooperated to raise 5 million yuan to organize the People's Food Regulation Committee, which works in conjunction with the National Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau established by the central government, without interfering with each other, managing grain and regulating grain. The purpose is to follow the instructions of the Premier: "Not to make money, but to feed the people." Speaking of the People's Food Regulation Committee of this province, its important tasks should include:</p>
<p>(1) Article 1 of the Provisional Measures for Purchasing and Regulating Food stipulates that "Food should be allowed to flow freely within the country in order to balance supply and demand and gradually move towards a fair price." This province has a shortage of grain and should naturally choose to purchase from provinces with surplus food such as Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi to benefit the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>(2) Article 4 of the Implementation Measures for Transporting and Regulating Food stipulates that "The Ministry of Industry and the Agricultural Bank of China shall negotiate with the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways to reduce railway and shipping freight for the transportation of local food for regulation." This province should negotiate with the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways to reduce freight for local food regulation, so as to facilitate transportation and reduce costs.</p>
<p>(3) Storage: Food that is not required for immediate consumption or sale should be stored in warehouses to avoid spoilage. The ancient Chinese system of righteous granaries was originally a good system. In the future, if we can learn from its intention and establish righteous granaries, community granaries, and permanent granaries in provinces, counties, districts, and townships, and adopt modern vacuum storage methods in areas with sufficient economic strength, that would be even better.</p>
<p>(4) Sales: The main purpose of regulating people's food is not to compete with the people for profit. We should supply as much as possible to meet market demand and keep prices stable so that people do not have to worry about rice being as expensive as pearls. If the people do not have to worry about a rice shortage, the market supply will increase, and the social economy will be in a harmonious state.</p>
<p>(2) Cracking down on smuggling and preventing grain from leaking to the sea: Although there is a shortage of grain in Guangdong Province, a portion of it is exported every year to cater to the preferences of overseas Chinese. There are also reports in newspapers from time to time about foreigners purchasing large quantities of grain from various parts of our country and Chinese traitors smuggling rice to supply the enemy's troops. This is indeed a contradictory phenomenon. Each province of our country should allow the free flow of grain, but it should crack down on smuggling and prevent grain from leaking to the sea, focusing on prohibiting grain exports and supervising exits to ensure that cunning people cannot take advantage of loopholes to smuggle grain.</p>
<p>(3) Prohibiting the elastic effect of grain prices: The high price of grain is often caused by the period between harvests and the lack of a sound social and economic organization. Landlords and grain merchants deliberately create a tense atmosphere of grain panic and hoard grain, which often causes grain prices to rise beyond the natural increase. The recent surge in rice prices in Guangzhou, which is rare in more than 20 years, can illustrate the reasons for this kind of transcendence of natural causes. Therefore, appropriate restrictions should be placed on the inventory and market prices of landlords and grain merchants to slightly reduce the possibility of speculation and profit-seeking, so that the elasticity of grain price changes can be reduced.</p>
<p>(4) Advocating thrift and restricting consumption: In extraordinary times, advocating thrift is of great significance. The fact that German leader Adolf Hitler does not eat butter is a manifestation of thrift. We should emulate this and control all useless consumption. For example, the use of grain for brewing wine, making sugar, cakes, and feeding livestock should all be banned to save consumption. Other changes in food and the application of substitutes should be based on the highest principle of producing and selling domestically produced rice. If there is a poor harvest of grain and rice in extraordinary times, and domestic rice is not enough for distribution, then foreign rice should be purchased or warehouses filled to make up for the shortage. On the rice tax side, we might as well reduce it slightly, or temporarily adopt a bookkeeping method. Fortunately, Annan, Siam, and Rangoon are areas that produce abundant rice and have always been our external food storage, which can be purchased to make up for the shortage. However, we should not regard taking food from external warehouses as normal and neglect the plan for self-sufficiency. We must know that relying on others is not a good plan, and we should not resort to this last resort unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>4. Actively Increasing Agricultural Production</p>
<p>However, the passive regulation of grain is only temporary, that is, a palliative measure. Actively increasing agricultural production is a permanent and fundamental plan. The ancients said, "The people can be without goods for a hundred years, but they cannot be without food for a day." There is also a proverb that says, "It is better to live poorly than to die well." These are indeed wise sayings that recognize the importance of grain and health. Now, if we want to actively increase agricultural production to feed the people, what is the way? I believe that the following five things must be given close attention.</p>
<p>(1) Production Control and Farm Cooperation: Modern economic society has moved from laissez-faire to controlled systems. To increase production, it is necessary to control production organizations and cooperate with farms. In terms of land, it is necessary to change the soil quality of cultivated land, what crops should be planted in certain areas, and what crops should be restricted or prohibited from cultivation in certain areas. In terms of labor, individual farming is very uneconomical. If individuals form units of one village or one township, abolish field ridges, and cultivate collectively, it will not only save the labor of each farmer and increase their income, but also improve their living standards, making rural areas more organized and cultivating their public spirit. This kind of public spirit has a close impact on a country's economy, culture, politics, and society, and is its most valuable by-product.</p>
<p>(2) Injecting Rural Finance: Capital, land, and labor are the three major elements of production. The most important thing about capital is circulation, and the most taboo is stagnation. Today, the pathology of our country's finance is that capital is concentrated in cities, and it is afraid and unable to invest as much as possible in industry and commerce, resulting in the revolving currency, which should be useful, becoming a dead loan that is not used. Rural areas suffer from severe anemia of capital, and farmers have no capital, making it difficult to make progress in all operations. We should now find ways to inject the excess money from cities into rural areas, so that the natural activity of finance is like the flow of blood in our human bodies. If this is the case, farmers will have the funds to purchase seeds, farm tools, fertilizers, etc., and they will be able to seize the time to cultivate and compete with the land for profit, and agricultural crops will be abundant, with large quantities being imported into cities for sale. It is easy to manufacture goods to return, and industry and commerce will also be affected and prosper.</p>
<p>(3) Improving Agricultural Technology: The agriculture of European and American countries was originally later than that of our country, but they have since surpassed us and are now in the stage of electrification. Although our country's agriculture has a long history, its technology is still hovering in the crude archetypes of the Middle Ages and should be improved urgently. The scope of improving agricultural technology is quite broad. Such as the selection of superior varieties, the improvement of livestock, the adoption of motorized waterwheels and steam plows, the transformation of fertilizers, the eradication of insect pests, the transformation of business methods, and the manufacturing of agricultural products, all are included.</p>
<p>(4) Reclaiming Wasteland and Consolidating Sandy Fields: The land area of Guangdong Province, according to statistics from the Bureau of Measurement, is 647,174 square miles, of which 30% to 45% is arable land, and 50% to 70% is suitable for forestry. The total area of existing fields is 40,062,100 Chinese acres. At 540 acres per square mile, this only accounts for 12% of the land area, with the rest being wilderness or barren mountains. From this, we know that the food shortage in this province is not due to congenital stinginess, but to poor human planning and the failure to make full use of the land. If we can advocate that the general public devote themselves to wasteland reclamation, not only will there be enough food, but there will also be a surplus. Moreover, wasteland reclamation can accommodate a lot of labor, which can provide workers with a special outlet and indirectly solve the social problem of unemployment. Moreover, this province borders the South China Sea and is traversed by the Pearl River. Due to natural changes and historical evolution, tides have created sandy fields. The scope of these sandy fields is also very broad. Whether they are field terraces, garden fields, tidal fields, mulberry fields, mulberry dikes, fish ponds, sunflower dikes, oyster and clam dikes, etc., they all belong to it. Consolidation will definitely help increase the food supply in this province.</p>
<p>(5) Others: There is more than one way to increase agricultural production, and what has been discussed above is only a brief introduction. Other measures include establishing agricultural schools, or requiring all secondary schools to add rural teacher training classes to improve farmers' knowledge, opening excellent grain seedling breeding farms to supply farmers with seeds to increase production, encouraging farmers to plant miscellaneous grains and engage in sideline businesses to increase their income, and improving transportation methods to reduce transportation and sales costs so that the province can purchase the same quantity of food at the same price in all directions. Standard prices, both minimum and maximum, should be set at all times. In order to protect producers, a minimum price should be set to avoid hurting farmers due to low grain prices. In order to protect consumers, a maximum price should be set to avoid hurting people due to high grain prices. As for the widespread establishment of grain stores in provinces, counties, townships, and villages, it is also necessary. (For example, there are more than 23,000 villages and streets in Guangxi Province, and more than half of them have grain storage facilities. Although the storage capacity of each grain store is less than 2,000 stones, it can avoid the risk of a sharp rise in rice prices.) Unlimited purchase and sale of grain will maintain rice prices in balance.</p>
<p>The ancients said, "Sow grain for one year." If we follow the aforementioned path, the Guangdong food problem can be completely solved in the near future in one or two seasons, or in the long run in one or two years. Demand and supply will be in harmony, and the people of this province will no longer have to panic about food.</p>
<h3>Exploration of the Nanyang Cotton Cloth Market (Continued from Issue 212)</h3>
<p>— Gao Shiheng</p>
<p>5. British Malaya</p>
<p>Malaya has a population of 4.4 million, with Singapore as its port of entry and exit. In 1935, import restriction regulations were implemented, which were slightly different from those in the Dutch East Indies and more fair. The method is based on the average quantity of imports from various countries to Malaya between 1929 and 1933 as the quantity allowed to be imported by a certain country in 1935 (see Table 5). Japan has 27 million yards, and China has only 11 million yards. Among the goods exported from China, dyed cloth accounts for a larger proportion, with 8.2 million yards in 1934, worth 860,000 yuan (see Tables 6 and 7). Among the dyed cloths, native cloth accounts for the majority, which is exclusively used by Chinese miners and plantation workers. Indigenous people do not use it. The Malayan government has included this native cloth in the dyed cloth, which is not appropriate because it is purely made by Chinese handicrafts and does not conflict with the world textile industry, but is closely related to China's rural economy. Consumers in Malaya are purely overseas Chinese. The investigation team has written to the Governor based on the above reasons, requesting that this ban be lifted, but negotiations are still ongoing. According to the current situation, Chinese cotton cloth has a relatively considerable position in Malaya and is easy to develop, but it depends on our efforts.</p>
<p>6. Siam</p>
<p>Siam is the only independent country in Nanyang, with 2.5 million overseas Chinese who occupy a very dominant position in commerce. The import of cotton cloth is mainly dominated by Japanese goods (see Tables 8 and 9). In 1935, imports from Japan were worth 9.8 million baht, while imports from China were only 19,000 baht, which is a huge difference. However, the figures for imports from Hong Kong should include a portion of Chinese goods, but there is no way to verify it. The Siamese government is also working hard to develop the cotton industry, seeking to be self-sufficient. However, Siamese cotton cloth merchants are concentrated in Bangkok, and the Bangkok cotton cloth market is concentrated on Sampeng Street. The people engaged in this business are all our overseas Chinese compatriots except for a few Indians. If the people of our country intend to promote sales in Siam, there is no need to worry about someone not serving, but ask yourself how the quality and price compare to Japanese goods!</p>
<p>7. Seeing the Crisis of Our Country's Cotton Textile Industry from the Nanyang Market</p>
<p>Japan is now vigorously advocating its so-called "China Agricultural Center Theory," hoping that China will always become Japan's agricultural supply base. According to Japan's annual cotton consumption of 710 million yuan, 370 million yuan is purchased from the United States, and 300 million yuan is purchased from India and Egypt. 20 million yuan from China, and recently a systematic plan has been made for cotton fields in North China. The original cotton industry market in the Yangtze River area has a tendency to gradually fall into the hands of Japanese merchants. China's cotton production is 8.1 million dan (estimated in the 25th year), and the annual consumption is 8.8 million dan. In addition to self-use, it also relies on the import of cotton from the United States and India. In Japan's view, it is best for China to specialize in the cotton industry and supply Japan's use. As for the cotton textile industry, it will be controlled by Japan single-handedly. Looking at the recent loss of more than 193,000 spindles and 1,500 looms in the five factories in North China, which have been sold to Japanese factories, the Japanese factories are expanding their scale and increasing the number of spindles and looms. There is a tendency to sweep away the cotton industry in North China and wipe out Chinese yarn factories. At this critical moment of life and death for China's cotton textile industry, how should we strive to unite and seek survival together? We must not follow the old saying "everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door" and repeat the mistake of "dying in peace." For example, today's rural harvest has a profit of dozens of yuan per package of yarn, thinking that the yarn factory has a great way to survive, but we do not know that the abundance of Chinese rural areas depends on the weather. Whether there will be a good harvest next year cannot be predicted. Under the ancient saying of "dying without peace," we should regard the state of the cotton factory in the 24th year of the Republic of China as the situation for the whole country. According to statistics, the number of spindles in operation was 4.8 million, and the number of spindles stopped was 1.35 million. The average number of spindles stopped was 2,100 hours, which means that the total number of weeks stopped in one year was 625. At that time, the cotton industry was running around and shouting for help, striving to provide relief. This year, in addition to the sale of the five factories in North China, Shanghai's cotton industrialists seem to have little concern for the overall future. We have returned from overseas and know that other people's intentions are unpredictable. The great crisis of Chinese merchants is still in the future. We believe that China's cotton textile industry is related to our country's national industry and all industries and commerce. We do not believe that China's cotton industry will prosper while other industries and commerce are not booming, or that the cotton industry will decline while other industries and commerce are still prosperous. Just in Shanghai, according to the statistics yearbook of the local association, there are 1,666 Chinese factories in Shanghai, with a capital of 129.44 million yuan, of which 31 are yarn factories, accounting for a capital of 42.94 million yuan, accounting for slightly less than one-quarter of the total, which shows its importance. The capital of Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai is 160.4 million yuan. The huge capital cannot be matched even by the capital of all the factories in Shanghai, which shows the fragility of our country's industry. If Chinese yarn factories once shake, our country's entire industry will not be able to stand. We already know that under the current economic situation, the market is shifting, and the market depends on rural areas. If the rural areas have a poor harvest, there is a risk of goods stagnating. If the rural areas have a good harvest, then the manufactured goods will be in greater demand than supply. To adjust this difficulty, we can only rely on export trade, and to recover the rights and interests of the country, as well as the earnest expectations of 6.5 million overseas Chinese in Nanyang, the arrival of national goods and clothing, our national industry's cotton textile manufacturers seem unable to give up this responsibility.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>The Bond Market in the First Week After the Holiday</p>
<p>Prices Soar with New Highs Frequently Seen</p>
<p>Last week, the public bond market, being the first week after the Spring Festival holiday, experienced a sudden and drastic surge in prices. This was due to the optimistic sentiment following the red opening of the lunar New Year, coupled with rumors of financial developments and preparations for exchanging coupons. As a result, market sentiment grew increasingly excited, with major players aggressively pushing up prices and small investors panicking and scrambling to cover their short positions. This led to a surge in buy orders and a market price that climbed steadily upward in the beginning of the week, reaching new highs unseen since trading began. However, towards the weekend, as long positions took profits, a reversal occurred, although the trend did not suggest a sharp decline. Today is the second to last day of this month's trading period, and a more intense struggle between long and short positions is expected. The week's progress is detailed below: On Monday, rumors circulated that preparations were being made to exchange legal tender bonds, with the proportion being changed from 40% to 60%. This excited market sentiment, and major players like Nos. 5, 35, and 77 actively purchased bonds, causing prices to surge across the board by 4.5 cents to 1.45 yuan. On Tuesday, the favorable rumors intensified, and market sentiment became even more buoyant. Major players aggressively bought bonds, and unified bonds rose again by 7 cents to 2.45 yuan across the board. On Wednesday, due to the rapid increase in prices, long positions gradually began to exit, and market prices fell across the board by 2 cents to 1.20 yuan. On Thursday, the trend stabilized, with long and short positions still holding their ground. Market conditions showed a slight rise. On Friday, long positions continued to sell, and market prices declined again. However, the market subsequently rebounded as major players cut their long positions and switched to short positions. On Saturday, the competition between long and short positions was intense, and market conditions were uncertain. Type A bonds were sold off heavily by Nos. 45 and 46, resulting in a decline of 7 cents. Overall, unified bond prices rose across the board by 8 cents to 1.8 yuan. Reconstruction bonds, with no remaining chips available on the open market, soared by 6 yuan. The total volume of transactions amounted to 45,625,000 yuan. A comparison of price increases, decreases, highs, and lows is listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Cotton and Yarn</h3>
<p>Recent US Cotton Still Difficult to Maintain</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with steady market conditions, with prices for each month rising by one to five points. Early in the morning, overnight, dealers bought nearby months, and foreign merchants bought far months. Positive news from Liverpool was a major factor in the price increase. The March contract was the most actively traded, with prices uniquely soft. Although dealers made limited-price purchases, it was still difficult to maintain. It is rumored that some dealer transactions were based on the belief that the government would purchase a large quantity of cloth, mortgaging cotton to sell a certain amount, as expected. At the close, short positions covered, and market conditions were firm. Spot prices fell by one point, and futures fell by one point to rise by four points. English cotton spot prices rose by three points, and futures rose by two points. Indian cotton initially rose due to public buying but then fell back due to selling by a certain speculative short position. Finally, it rose again due to dealer buying and positive news from Liverpool. The Pinggu'er variety rose by half a rupee, the Aomula variety rose by 0.75 to 1 rupee, and the Bairoxi variety rose by 1 rupee. Original telegram record (telegram of the 20th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for the 22nd is Bairoxi at 221 rupees, Aomula at 203.75 rupees, and Pinggu'er at 179.25 rupees, all up by 0.25 rupees.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Domestic Green Sugar Remains Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend for foreign sugar was flat and weak, showing a slight decline. Domestic green and red sugar felt quite tight. At the guild's pricing meeting, No. 24 group sand white spot was 22.9 yuan, transit goods 7.5 yuan, Dongbai spot No. 4 was 23.05 yuan, No. 8 was 22.65 yuan, No. 9 was 22.5 yuan, transit No. 8 was 7.75 yuan, No. 9 YRO mark was 7.45 yuan, all down 5 cents. The local factory's Mianbai Zhenji Dahua Jinxin, etc., all maintained their original prices. For branded goods, in the past two days, Guangbang released over 280 pieces of Nanjiang green at 14 yuan, over 200 boxes of Beihai green sheet at 11 yuan, over 100 packages of Zhuqing at 13.4 yuan, up 2 cents, Xinghua bang released over 200 pieces of Mingjing red, the higher priced ones at 15.2 yuan to 15 yuan, the next grade at 14.9 yuan to 67 cents, Chao bang released over 200 packages of Huanggang green at 14.3 yuan, forward Dutch red was released by Dachang for 450 tons to be delivered in September and October at a price of 3.775 Dutch guilders.</p>
<p>Shantou telegraph, green sugar rose another 1 cent, cotton red flat and stable, no increase or decrease, also according to Xiamen telegraph, Chao bang is collecting Diaoqing in Zhangzhou, the price for declaration should be 14.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Northern and Southern Rice Markets Differ in Firmness and Weakness</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were more than ten companies from various sources in Hexia. Although the weather was continuously rainy, market demand for various goods was acceptable. Top-quality white japonica rice prices were firm, medium and second-quality white japonica rice prices increased by several cents to 1 cent, processed rice prices increased by 4-5 cents, and while prices for high-quality thin rice were fixed, prices for medium and second-quality thin rice were weak. Prices for other types of rice also showed tightness.</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, there were 17-18 companies from various regions, with a total of 3,700-3,800 shi of goods, including more than ten companies dealing in thin rice. Wholesale and sales in the market were quiet. Only Qingdao companies handled a load of thin rice. The local market also remained sluggish, so the situation continued to be weak, and market conditions declined. Prices for thin rice fell nearly 1 cent again. High-quality japonica rice showed a stable-to-soft trend. The outlook for the market remains difficult to be optimistic. Duyang tip rice had no market, and Yin yuan was quite stable.</p>

<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>American Association Steel Plant Needs Major Action</p>
<p>Recently, transactions of 200-pound American Association steel have suddenly started at the factory level. Although yesterday was Sunday, transactions still reached as many as 600-700 cases, sold at 40 yuan per case. However, for credit sales, the price must be no less than 41 yuan. Overseas market prices have recently reached 9.5 gold yuan, a gain of 3 cents compared to last week. A total survey of the city shows that there are only 4-5 thousand cases in stock. If not much arrives, the market price may not easily ease for a while.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>The Woolen Industry in the 25th Year Passes Pleasantly</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Develop, English Goods Decline</p>
<p>Great Progress in Domestic Woolens</p>
<p>Prices Inevitably Rise</p>
<p>Smuggled Goods Cannot Be Sold in Shanghai</p>
<p>Prompts Industry to Join the Association</p>
<p>The woolen industry in the 25th year saw profits for most businesses. Selling prices increased step by step, especially in late autumn and early winter, when they rose rapidly. Both buyers and sellers lamented the lack of goods despite the availability of money. The surge in purchases by the Changsha and Sichuan groups was the first such occurrence since the January 28th Incident. Sales to other regions were also more active than in previous years, a full sign of commercial recovery during a good harvest.</p>
<p>(January) Due to the approaching Lunar New Year, the woolen industry closed accounts, inventoried stock, and trading was very light. However, demand for riding breeches and "fasi cun" (a type of wool fabric) remained strong. The Sichuan group also took advantage of the end of the year to seek out cheap direct goods, such as serge and "Hua Te" (a type of wool fabric). On the 28th (the fifth day of the Lunar New Year), businesses reopened, and opening prices were higher than before. Brokers and salesmen were busy soliciting silver dollar business. (Note: Silver dollar business is the first transaction of the year handled by people in the industry). (February) New Year prices increased compared to previous years due to a lack of goods and foreign exchange issues. The increase in "Dong Huo" (Japanese goods) serge and light flannel was particularly strong. "Xi Huo" (Western goods) "Hai Li Si" (Harris Tweed) rose even faster. "Yuan Zhi Gong" (high-quality serge), thick serge, printed flannel, "fasi cun," "Hua Te," pullover cloth, raincoat fabric, and so on, all increased in price. Dealers with large stocks on hand were overjoyed. Credit sales were more cautious than in previous years. The trend for Japanese goods was very active, threatening to overwhelm English goods. As a result, most foreign firms and woolen businesses at sea switched to Japanese accounts. (March) Business further progressed and expanded. Prices for 70-80% of goods continued to rise. Japanese goods developed, English goods declined, and domestic goods had a wide outlet. Demand for original-color serge was particularly strong, thanks to government support. Due to the long spring (with a leap month), demand for herringbone fabrics extended. Flannel was firm and rising. There was a lack of thick serge. (April) Customers and local buyers had strong demand. Domestic woolen sales were strong. Summer white goods were all selling well in a timely manner. Demand for "Luo Si" (a type of silk fabric), "Pai Li Si" (poplin), and white rubber cloth was particularly strong. Wholesale business for store-fronts increased sharply. The trend at the association was still for active Japanese goods. Buyers actively sought out lower-grade cheap woolens and fabrics. As a result, transactions for mortgaged goods and closed-down shops were negotiated and completed daily. New goods were more expensive than old goods due to the impact of legal tender. As a result, summer seasonal white serge, white "Zhi Gong" (a type of silk fabric), "Pai Li Si," linen rubber cloth, "Fan Li Ding" (a type of wool fabric), etc., all rose rapidly. Japanese white serge, which used to sell for 2.7-2.8 yuan, now uniformly sold for 2.4-2.5 yuan. (May) Trading remained brisk for summer goods. Both "Xi Huo" (Western goods) "Pai Li Si" arrival and stocks were scarce. As a result, standard market prices continued to rise. Due to the steady arrival of Japanese "Pai Li Si," although sales were strong, prices mostly fell. White serge and white "Zhi Gong" (a type of silk fabric) sold actively, but the entry of smuggled goods into Shanghai caused prices to soften. However, most people in the industry who knew about it did not dare to buy or sell them. As a result, Japanese woolens and fabrics without formal passes could only circulate sporadically and were not traded in full boxes. "Luo Si" and "Fan Li Ding" sold smoothly and prices were firm. Feather yarn fabrics showed signs of weakness. Demand for tea silk twill "Ka Gan" (khaki) and beige rubber cloth was strong. The rapid increase in prices for wide-width yellow linen rubber cloth was due to shortages rather than strong sales. Japanese light flannel fell sharply by over ten cents due to smuggled goods. Due to the weather, "Hai Ling Peng" (a type of fabric) suffered from a lack of both arrival and sales. Woolen businesses that reduced prices mostly used this as a sacrifice, causing formal sales to stop and prices to fall accordingly. (June) The factory's "Zhang Hua," "Yi He," "Xie Xin," and other three factories' "Fan Li Ding," white serge, "Pai Li Si," and "Luo Si" and so on sold well. Other spun fabrics and domestic machine-made cloth, such as white lining, "Chong Pai Li Si," "Chong Yu Sha Ni" (feather yarn fabric), and "Ma Jiao Bu" (linen rubber cloth), all became popular. Inland customers were particularly eager to purchase them. Various domestic machine-made cloths priced from 33-34 cents to 40 cents were released in large quantities at the public tea house every day, and both sellers and buyers could profit. At the end of the month, the British firm "De Ji Yang Hang" and "Heng Te Sheng" reorganized and released a large amount of spot goods, valued at 200,000 yuan. It is said that businesses in the industry jointly formed the "Lian Yi" Company, specializing in the sale of domestic woolen fabrics, and signed contracts with "Yi He" and "Xie Xin." Due to the rampant smuggling of goods in North China, it was very difficult to transport goods. Without a pass and proof from the industry association to the customs to exchange for a tax-paid certificate, loading was not allowed. (July) The market was still good for the first half of the month. Buyers continued to add summer goods. Prices for wide white canvas and yellow twill increased. Eastern "Pai Li Si" gradually sold out and began to rise. For the second half of the month, summer sales declined. Businesses took advantage of the hot weather to air out mildew and rest. However, large wholesale stores with slightly more capital went out to seek out spot goods from foreign firms, such as "Mai Er Deng" (melton), plain thick woolen, overcoat cloth, yellow woolen, pullover cloth, etc., which would be in demand in autumn and winter, and continued to negotiate transactions. Agents in Shanghai from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guiyang, and Changsha asked for samples and inquired about purchasing new autumn and winter goods. (August) Various autumn and winter goods were launched on the market. There was a major turnaround in the woolen market. Long-distance customers, such as those from Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Yunnan, showed strong demand. Serge, "Yuan Zhi Gong," "Yin Feng Rong" (a type of wool fabric), melton, "Lan Hu Ni" (a type of woolen fabric), plain thick woolen, pullover cloth, light flannel, camel hair, shoe woolen, etc., were traded in large quantities every week. Purchases by various groups were stronger than in previous years. Standard market prices were very firm, more expensive than the spring market. With thin stocks, businesses were optimistic and upward-looking. Polish goods sold particularly well and were even more in demand. Those with slightly more skill and talent used manipulative techniques to profit greatly from plain thick woolen, melton, lower-grade overcoat cloth, and "Lan Hu Ni." Due to tightened inspections, there were no smuggled goods arriving in Shanghai, resulting in an increase in formal declarations with taxes paid. More and more people joined the industry association. Small brokers and businesses lost half of their business to out-of-town customers. (September) Due to the cooler weather, actual sales were brisk. Local and out-of-town customers showed strong demand. Pullovers and other goods sold well. Prices for all goods continued to rise. The Sichuan, Tianjin, and Changsha groups continued to be active in purchasing. Stocks of shoe felt, plain thick woolen, and "Lan Hu Ni" decreased. Standard prices were continuously rising. Yellow serge rose in price due to being selected for making large quantities of uniforms, both for foreign and domestic goods. The market was better than in any previous year. What was unique was that despite the rise in prices, buyers did not complain about the high prices but only lamented the lack of goods. This market situation could be said to be a commercial recovery, indicating an increase in people's purchasing power. (October) Was even better than September. Prices for most goods rose one after another. Wide and tight camel hair first increased in price by 1.5 cents starting in the middle of the month. "Zhang Hua Ren Li" uniform cloth increased in price by 2 cents per yard starting on the 20th. Prices for thick goods needed for autumn and winter, whether Western or Eastern, were reported to be rising. Domestic and non-domestic medium and thick serge were in short supply. Market prices changed three times a day, rising steadily. Plain thick woolen and melton were in short supply. Riding breeches, herringbone fabrics, and overcoat cloth, which had previously been offered at high list prices, could be loosened by sellers on the black market. But today, with the cold weather, actual sales suddenly increased, causing black market prices to also suddenly turn high. At the end of the month, the price of horsehair, sleeve lining silk, and silky feather yarn fabrics suddenly rose due to the soaring price of raw materials, causing most small weaving factories to stop weaving. Plaid men's and women's colored woolens were extremely popular and widely sold. High-striped black and gray suit serge, "Chong Shi Pao Tui Ke Si" (a type of fabric), etc., sold well in local and out-of-town suit shops. However, many felt that there was a shortage. Due to the lack of rain, raincoat fabric sales were sluggish and there was no special price increase. "Se Zi Gong" (a type of fabric) and "Sha Mi" (cashmere) were in a strong position because leather coats were about to be launched on the market and buyers had a great need for them. (November) The woolen market continued to improve. Prices for all goods either rose or remained the same. Demand for overcoat cloth and thick goods suddenly increased due to the cold weather, and sales channels widened sharply. Demand from local buyers and those in Nanjing and Hangzhou was strong. Medium and thick serge remained scarce. Riding breeches sold smoothly and prices rose, with domestic goods being particularly successful. The "Lian Yi" company, the sole distributor of domestic goods, was always crowded with customers. Whenever a truck arrived from the factory, customers would scramble for goods, often leading to disputes. Dark blue plain thick woolen melton was extremely scarce and in demand. Black riding breeches were hoarded for speculation. The same goods could vary in price by 30-40 cents due to color, which was difficult to predict beforehand. Horsehair satin and horse tailing fabrics sold smoothly, were in short supply, and prices rose sharply. "Ke Luo Ding" (cloth) and long-haired camel hair (called "Kai Mo Tai Ke Si" by suit shops and "Hai Bai Long" by women's clothing shops) were popular throughout Shanghai and sold extremely well. Sales to long-distance customers were weak due to slow transport and arrival, but sales to inland customers with convenient transport were strong. Business at local men's and women's clothing stores increased daily. Woolen shops on Qipan Street saw business increase daily. Business at foreign clothing stores on Daxin Street, Avenue Joffre, and Sichuan Road also increased rapidly. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Eating Around the World</h3>
<p>— (Xiang Sheng)</p>
<p>Shanxi Bream</p>
<p>In the past, Wang Xizhi lived in Shanyin. One night, the snow had just cleared, and the moonlight was clear and bright. He suddenly remembered Dai Da, who was at that time in Shanxi. So, he took a small boat to visit him. Upon reaching the door, he turned back, saying: "I came on a whim, and the whim is over. Why must I see Dai?" Reading this story fills one with longing. Shanxi is located in Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, and is the upper reaches of the Cao'e River. Because of the visit to Dai, it is also called Daixi. The area is full of towering mountains and surrounded by dense forests. The Shanxi River emerges from within, winding and turning for more than a hundred miles. My fellow student, Xia Naichou, said that there is a Zishi Mountain, also called Zhishi Mountain, because there are stones at the foot of the mountain that look like slender fingers. It is also called Zhirishi Stone because the stone faces east. The stream water next to the mountain is particularly sweet and clear. The bream produced in the stream has a flat body and small head, with fine scales arranged in rows, and the abdomen is deep blue in color, with a dazzling light. The meat is as delicate and tender as fat, and the taste is extremely delicious. It is best for steaming. A few slices of southern ham and bamboo shoots are added to the fish, and after cooking, it is even more fragrant and delightful, making one's mouth water. It is an excellent dish to accompany wine or rice. Occasionally, it is braised in red sauce, but the taste is far inferior to steaming. This fish is best in winter, when it is more than a foot long, the meat is plump and full, and the flavor is very different after being frozen. When the grass turns white from frost and the clouds turn yellow before snow, the locals gather to buy pear blossom wine and eat steamed bream, which they consider the only pleasure, and those who travel to Sheng compete to enjoy it. Bream is found everywhere, but it does not have the unique flat shape and blue scales, and the taste is far inferior. It is like the perch of Songjiang, which, because of its four gills, stirred Zhang Han's thoughts of returning home. Moreover, this fish has a small myth that can be used as conversation: It is said that in the past there was a Mr. Xie, who lived in seclusion near Zishi Mountain and liked to eat fish. He often ordered his servants to use an empty charcoal basket, place bait in it, tie it, and sink it into the water. The next morning, when he lifted it, he would surely get a large fish. This happened every day. Other fishermen, even though they set nets, could not get any fish. Therefore, he hated this unusual occurrence and secretly pulled up the basket, lifted his foot and kicked it flat, thinking that the big fish would no longer be able to enter it. The next night, when the servant opened the basket, there was a miraculously flat bream. He took it back to show Mr. Xie and told him that the basket had been kicked. Mr. Xie smiled and said, "I have my own good fortune. What can a little rascal do to me!" From then on, bream became a famous product of Sheng County, but let us take this as a rumor and listen to it as such. It is not to be taken as historical fact.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Oranges</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Recently, a certain Western newspaper in Shanghai reported that this week, a ship arrived in Shanghai with Chinese oranges cultivated in Sichuan using scientific methods, and more will continue to arrive to meet the needs of the market. This scientific method of orange cultivation is being tested by the National Sichuan University in Chengdu. If this cultivation is completely successful, then the result may replace the oranges worth 800,000 yuan imported from foreign countries every year. The first batch of Sichuan oranges shipped to Shanghai this time is almost identical to the imported American oranges in terms of color, aroma, and taste. They are being managed and sold wholesale on the market by the Shanghai branch of the China Economic Society.</p>
<p>These Sichuan oranges are grown from seedlings cultivated by the National Sichuan University's Agricultural Science Experiment Station using excellent Chinese orange varieties. The cultivation of orange varieties is done using scientific methods, with great attention to detail. After the oranges ripen, all procedures such as washing, grading, and packaging are carried out using the latest modern methods. Currently, the market price of American oranges in Shanghai is high, around 20 to 35 cents per orange, due to the impact of the American sailors' strike and the scarcity of goods. Therefore, the launch of these newly produced Sichuan oranges at this time should be a very good opportunity for sale. The price of Sichuan oranges is only slightly higher than that of other local oranges, such as those from Guangdong and Fujian, which means that compared to American oranges of the same size, their value is half as much. Eighty percent of this low price is spent on transportation costs from Jintang County near Chengdu to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the origin of oranges is in South China and the Burmese Peninsula. And the mandarin oranges produced in various places are still generally called Chinese oranges. However, although the origin of oranges is China, the orange varieties in various parts of the world were spread from China via India. However, China has now become a major importer of foreign oranges. According to statistics from the Shanghai branch of the International Trade Bureau in November of last year, a total of 50,200 pounds of foreign oranges were imported, worth 19,281 yuan. And from January to November, the total import of foreign oranges was as much as 2,185,800 pounds, worth a huge 832,126 yuan. Therefore, the scientific cultivation of orange trees, if it can gradually improve the production of oranges by improving seeds, then China may be able to stop this leakage, which is a good result. And China, which was originally the place of origin of oranges, may once again become a major producer of high-quality oranges.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Rice Cakes</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiaokan</p>
<p>Ningbo is the most prosperous giant county in eastern Zhejiang. In the past, when Luo Huiqiao and Yang Ziyi were in charge, it was also called a city. At the same time, it is also my hometown. Although everything in Ningbo cannot be compared to Shanghai, the Paris of the East, the towering and magnificent new buildings and the clean and flat asphalt roads fully reveal the characteristics of a modern city.</p>
<p>In addition to formal transactions, Ningbo people spend their spare time throughout the year on "eating." Especially at the end of the lunar year, they are very busy, making rice cakes, glutinous rice cakes, wind-dried chicken, rolled meat, etc. Rice cakes in particular, whether for the propertied class or lower and middle class families, some must be made or bought in accordance with the tradition. As a result, the production method of rice cakes is particularly exquisite and improving day by day.</p>
<p>Ningbo rice cakes are clean, white, and delicate. The strips are uniform, and the styles are very beautiful. They are printed with various figures, landscapes, flowers, and other vivid images, which indeed have some artistic meaning that cannot be matched by rice cakes produced anywhere else! Cut them into thin slices and stir-fry them in a pot with lard, shredded pork, green vegetables, shrimp, and bamboo shoots for about ten minutes before serving. As for the taste being delicious and appetizing, and filling, all friends who have tasted Ningbo rice cakes have a very good impression, praising them highly. I don't need to elaborate here!</p>
<h3>Central Fort Drunken Crab</h3>
<p>— Chen Tianci</p>
<p>In Shanghai, in the cold dish shops of various lively areas, there is a type of salted crab for sale. These crabs all taste very fresh and delicious, and the prices are also very expensive. Even a small one costs one or two dimes.</p>
<p>I usually like to eat this kind of salty food the most, especially salted crab, which suits my taste even more. Therefore, I have tried salted crabs from all the major cold dish shops in Shanghai. Although the taste is quite good, it still doesn't come close to the freshness and aftertaste of the drunken crabs from Central Fort.</p>
<p>Central Fort is located in the lowest area of Xingyi County, so rivers crisscross all year round, like a water country. It is bordered by Wu Gong Lake to the south and Da Zong Lake to the north. Due to the mutual circulation of the two lakes, there is a special product of plump crabs, especially many with round navels. And it is different from the crabs produced elsewhere. The crabs there have large, plump legs with few leg hairs, and are rich in fresh and delicious crab roe. Therefore, the fatness and deliciousness of Central Fort drunken crab is famous, all thanks to the superior quality of the crabs produced there. When I first tasted this kind of drunken crab in Central Fort, I really felt that I was very fortunate. So I asked the waiter in the shop about the method of making drunken crab. At first, he refused to tell me, but later, after I moved his heart by giving him extra tips, he began to tell me how to make drunken crab. It turns out that the method of making drunken crab is to first select large crabs with fat, round navels, wash them clean, and then place them in a vat. You must wait for them to completely spit out the white foam in their bellies before taking them out and putting them in pre-made fine wine. This wine is brewed from glutinous rice, with a sweet and delicious taste. The wine is also mixed with fennel, peppercorns, and other spices, and then mixed with a suitable amount of salt water, so it is exceptionally fresh and delicious. These crabs, which had been thirsty for a long time, received this sweet honey wine and ate their fill. No wonder they all got drunk and died. Then, after about a week, they can be taken out to serve the guests.</p>
<h3>Swapping Nests of Phoenixes</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven (Whispered Words Touch Compassionate Heart, Repentance Sacrifices Filial Piety, Autumn Light Dims Emerald Brows, Scenery Evokes Sentiments)</p>
<p>This interruption managed to divert Menglan's questioning. The Second Young Mistress picked up her teacup, sat opposite him, and slowly drank, smiling at him: "Mother is truly a慈母(címǔ - compassionate mother). These tea leaves have been kept in the porcelain jar for several months, and she's always reluctant to drink them herself. But as soon as she sees us happy, she immediately takes out the tea leaves to make tea for us." Menglan said: "Mother is indeed a 慈母(címǔ - compassionate mother). She is indeed kind to us children. Even to the two young mistresses, it's hard to find elsewhere, right?" The Second Young Mistress smiled and nodded twice, saying: "You're absolutely right. When I go back to my mother's house, my mother always says to me, 'You cultivated good karma in your past life. Your mother-in-law is really good to her servants.'" Menglan was very happy to hear her sister-in-law praising her mother and finished her cup of tea, saying with a smile: "We're always drinking plain tea, and we're getting tired of the bland taste. Stay in my room for a while longer, and I'll go buy some snacks. We can eat and drink and chat to our hearts' content, and I can relieve the boredom in my chest." She only said this one sentence, and then she heard someone outside the door answering, "I'll go to Madam's room to get them." After the instruction was given, the stairs started to creak. The Second Young Mistress said with a smile: "We're just talking and didn't realize that the child, Xiaoju, had been hiding outside for a long time." Menglan sighed and said: "That's also a poor thing. People always say 'sharp-tongued maid,' and I thought that was a preconceived notion. I thought that maids always spoke quickly. You can always forgive me, and that's how I feel now, complaining about the smallest things. Actually, I don't have any opinion about that matter. For example, this child Xiaoju, for no reason, I have to scold her a few times, and after scolding her, I regret it. Oh dear, how did I use Xiaoju as an example to scold someone, and I misspoke again." The Second Young Mistress waved her hand and said with a smile: "We sisters-in-law are talking, why would we hold back so much? If that were the case, wouldn't it seem too distant? I think you're good this way. Whatever you have in your heart, you say it. It's better than keeping things bottled up inside." Menglan said with a smile: "Do you think I have things in my heart that I don't say? I don't even feel that way myself." The Second Young Mistress said with a smile: "That's not what I meant. Mother often worries about this." Menglan said with a smile: "Mother worries about my affairs?" The Second Young Mistress straightened her body and composed herself, and said: "Sister, you don't know, Mother often mentions you when she talks to us, always saying that you have things in your heart that you don't say, and that you'll get sick from it in the future." How would he know? Because he himself is hiding a stomach full of illness. Menglan said: "My mother is hiding a stomach full of illness?" The Second Young Mistress said: "Are you only finding out about this today? He has quite a serious illness. Because he's afraid that you'll feel bad after telling you, he's always kept it a secret."

<h3>Guangdong's Spring Festival Foods</h3>
<p>— Ruo</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the old lunar year has passed. As the author pens this article, the housewives are already prepared with their intestines, preserved meats, and have begun purchasing glutinous rice, oil, and sugar, engaging in their even busier work.</p>
<p>They were born with a pair of nimble hands, allowing them to do anything, and regardless of wealth, they all have the energy to do things. They are not very happy to buy things that they can make themselves. Especially in the countryside.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about some of these things in a haphazard manner, which may arouse the interest of readers.</p>
<p>"Ru Long"　"Ru Long" is said to be a corruption of "yu liang" (餘糧 - surplus grain), but now everyone calls it that. This is the most important item for offering sacrifices to the gods during the Spring Festival, and no one can be without it, just like the turkey for Christmas in Europe. They also consider it a symbol of good luck and do not give it to others except for their own consumption. The method is very simple. Mix glutinous rice flour, yellow sugar, and water in a large basin to form a paste, then put it in a steamer lined with winter leaves and steam it for a day and a half. It is also not made with salty or rock sugar, which is used exclusively for eating.</p>
<p>Luk Dui　First, use glutinous rice flour mixed with filtered white sugar to make a semi-cooked, very sticky dough, and then use this dough to make hollow dumplings, then put them in a pot of oil and cook them until they are quite swollen. The so-called "Luk Dui" is then complete. There are also solid ones. Like "Ru Long", this is also considered an auspicious thing; a good day must be chosen to cook it, and children are not allowed to say bad things while cooking.</p>
<p>Sugar Rings　These are usually made together with "Luk Dui". Mix the flour used to make "Luk Dui" with sweet potato, then imprint it into a wooden mold, and skillfully shave it lightly to create the prototype of a "sugar ring". After cooking in a pot of oil, they are crispy and delicious.</p>
<p>Fried Rice Cakes　First grind the fried glutinous rice into a fine powder, then mix it with yellow sugar or white sugar to make "fried rice cakes", then use these "fried rice cakes" to imprint various cake shapes on a cake mold, and finally take them to a temporary stove made of bricks and bake them for a while. This work is very troublesome, but this trouble cannot resist the interest of the housewives. They work together with their neighbors, day and night. The sound of pestles is heard throughout the neighborhood, which is very interesting.</p>
<p>In addition, Song gao (鬆糕 - steamed rice cake), chrysanthemum cakes, goose intestines, rice noodle slices, and zhu tou (蛀頭 - worm-eaten head) are also important homemade foods, but for the sake of space, I can only omit them.</p>
<p>As for the things bought in the market, such as winter bamboo shoots, egg yolk cakes, almond dry rations, and puffed rice... the variety is truly endless, and the crossroads are already full of them.</p>
<h3>Suzhou's Cooked Food Peddlers</h3>
<p>— Delin</p>
<p>Every day in the evening, I go home after finishing my work, because my workplace is very close to my home, only a short two alleys, less than half a mile away. After working for a day, I feel very tired mentally. When I go home, I always stroll back slowly, using it as a slight exercise to recover from the accumulated fatigue of the day. But walking alone in the narrow alleys, the most annoying thing is the rickshaws weaving back and forth. They charge around and often cannot be avoided, and there is no way to retreat, because the narrow alleys are so narrow that after a rickshaw passes, it blocks traffic, and no second person can walk. Secondly, there are even more cooked food peddlers who knock various sounds of "du du du" and "da da da", selling wontons, sweet soup balls, tofu pudding, all along the way, lined up one after another, resting in the middle of the street, but they all rest in a certain place, and compared to the rickshaws weaving back and forth, walking is not as annoying.</p>
<p>These cooked food peddlers each have their own customers. Every day at a certain time, they carry their burdens and stop in front of each house in every alley, using bamboo tubes to knock out different sounds to attract their customers, so that those customers can distinguish from the sounds of "du du du" and "da da da", that this is a wonton peddler, that is a sweet soup ball peddler, or a tofu pudding peddler, and then they can run out of the house to buy.</p>
<p>In many alleys in Suzhou, there are many wealthy and noble families with black lacquered doors. They still maintain the colors of feudalism, and women do not leave their homes. But there is a common habit of standing at the door. In the evening, young wives and ladies with powdered faces and red lips stand at the door looking around. These are the only customers of the cooked food peddlers. They also call them Miss or Young Mistress, just like servants, to win their favor, because these are long-term customers who take care of their business throughout the year. On days when they do not come to stand at the door, if they hear the sounds of "du du du" and "da da da" in the house, they send their maids to buy, and from the maids' mouths, they learn whether it is for the Miss or the Young Mistress. These cooked food peddlers can also distinguish their personalities. The Miss likes it salty, the Young Mistress likes it bland, so the cooked food peddlers in Suzhou are all eloquent and good at speaking. And they most like to stop in the narrow alleys.</p>

<p>Declaration Issued</p>
<p>The declaration of the inaugural meeting of the Naval Branch of the China Military Transportation Society stated: "All European and Western countries, all world powers, attach importance to maritime administration and develop the maritime industry. Therefore, externally, they seek to expand shipping lanes, and internally, they strive to protect the integrity of maritime rights. The people work hard to manage and spare no effort, and the government actively encourages and is meticulous. The rise and fall of maritime administration is related to the prosperity and decline of the maritime industry. It not only directly affects cultural exchanges and trade, but also indirectly affects the prosperity and decline of the national economy and the rise and fall of a country's politics. It has a close relationship. Before China's opening up of maritime trade, domestic transportation followed the policies of the Zhou Dynasty's Sima, and due to its simplicity, there was no transportation to speak of. In the late Qing Dynasty, with the introduction of new transportation from the East, the Ministry of Posts and Communications was established. Maritime administration began at this time. However, in the decades since then, with the rise of the revolution and frequent national crises, maritime administration has declined and the maritime industry has declined. Those with sincerity are secretly worried. Since the establishment of the National Government in the Southeast, successive transportation authorities have known the importance of maritime administration. If it is not reformed and revitalized, it will not be able to achieve anything. If it is not constructed, it will not be able to develop. They have announced various laws and regulations and established maritime administration agencies, while thoroughly reorganizing the China Merchants Bureau to establish the foundation of state-owned maritime industry. With grand plans and hard work, China's maritime administration has been revived. However, because China is bound by unequal treaties, inland and coastal navigation rights have been almost completely lost. Foreign ships are rampant and take the place of the hosts, while the domestic maritime industry is under pressure and is struggling to survive. The government has gradually innovated in recent years, but these are all passive improvements, with little active development. Given China's economic scarcity and difficult situation, it is difficult to take into account both the policies of maritime administration construction and the methods of guarantee and reward, and to carry them out step by step. Therefore, the current facilities of maritime administration in China are likely to be of little effect and will not help with the major difficulties. In view of this, our association, under the leadership of the General Association, with the great vision of revitalizing maritime administration and developing the maritime industry, and with the purpose of gathering strength and collecting ideas, has gathered enthusiastic people from the national maritime industry to carry out propaganda on maritime administration academics and explore maritime administration construction. All issues related to the recovery of lost maritime rights, the improvement of private maritime industry, the management of foreign maritime industry, the adjustment of maritime finance, the management of national sailors, the cooperation of national maritime industry, the control of maritime industry during peacetime, and all issues directly and indirectly related to maritime administration, are all carefully studied and contributed to the government, with the aim of taking the lead in developing the maritime industry and giving the Chinese people the direction to strive for maritime administration construction. At this time of powerful neighbors and dangerous national situation, the international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. Once a major war breaks out, it is necessary to mobilize national transportation in order to exert military functions and achieve the effect of arms and fingers, and to control the enemy in advance and seize the victory. Because transportation construction is related to national defense, it is urgent. Maritime administration is particularly difficult to ignore. Because China has crisscrossing rivers and is spread throughout the country, and the current land transportation is not perfect, military transportation must make use of waterways. Therefore, this association's control of wartime ships, the implementation of military water transportation, and the design of wartime water transportation all require careful discussion and practical recommendations, so as to integrate maritime administration into national defense, and not just develop peacetime maritime industry. Our association is aware of the difficulties of the times and the reality of the situation. The historical mission it bears is very important. All our colleagues in the maritime industry should be enthusiastic, love each other, and work together to achieve success, wash away the past bad habits of indifference, and eliminate the inferiority of individualism. We hope that this association will have a strong organization and become a powerful force. Not only can the future of maritime administration be expected to be developed, but also China's transportation will be deeply beneficial. We hope that the people of the country will give guidance at all times. We solemnly declare this."</p>
<h3>How Local Associations Greet the Press to Report on the Exhibition Commemorating Aid to Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Huang Yanpei Discusses the Crisis in Suiyuan as Still Extremely Severe, Will Regularly Invite Presidents of Large, Medium, and Small Schools, etc.</p>
<p>Shanghai Local Association member Zhang Rongchu, in order to aid Suiyuan's resistance against Japan and to provide relief to wounded soldiers and refugees, sent furniture, furs, antiques, and famous paintings worth over 30,000 yuan to the association, requesting that they be sold and the proceeds remitted to the front lines. The association's board of directors decided to jointly issue 10,000 donation coupons commemorating aid to Suiyuan, each priced at five yuan, with the Shanghai Women's Circle Aid Suiyuan and Suppress Bandits Comfort Team. The items are displayed on the third floor of the Pudong Building, open to the public. Yesterday, the association first invited the press to visit, with association members Huang Yanpei and Ren Jinpin, among others, hosting. They first visited each room, divided into eight large rooms, displaying bedroom, living room, study, large kitchen, furniture, and sable, fox, squirrel, and blue wool sheep skin clothing, with values ranging from several hundred to two thousand yuan. They all greatly admired Zhang Jun's spirit of destroying his home to aid the war effort.</p>
<p>Huang Yanpei's Report</p>
<p>Huang Yanpei then reported on Zhang Jun's donation of furniture and furs to raise funds for aid to Suiyuan, stating roughly that Zhang Jun sent a letter to the association, initiating this action, as early as last November. Later, due to the Xi'an Incident, the association put the matter aside. Later, due to the New Year and Spring Festival, the work of displaying and numbering was slightly delayed. Although the Suiyuan war seems to be quiet at present, the crisis still exists, or even is secretly tightening. The future crisis may be even worse than before. Therefore, the people in the rear feel even more urgent to aid Suiyuan's war and relieve refugees and wounded soldiers. To this end, in addition to asking for your guidance, we also ask you to widely promote this, in order to increase the public's enthusiasm for donating money to the country and preparing for a rainy day. Only by having sufficient preparations in peacetime can we cope with emergencies more easily.</p>
<p>Original Plan for Donating Materials to Aid Suiyuan</p>
<p>The association also released the original letter from Zhang Rongchu to the association, with fervent words that moved people. Excerpts are as follows: (omitted above) "Fortunately, the creditors are broad-minded and appreciate the government's policy of economic construction, and are all willing to help. With regard to the debt guarantee of Rongchu Company, they have all agreed to clear the debt. Moreover, the Shanghai Bank, which bears the mortgage of the dye-printing factory, upholds the principle of protecting the industry and has granted a one-year extension. Furthermore, a large money house that bears the mortgage of the factory base also follows the same enthusiasm and shares appropriate solutions in order to maintain the production factory and give the opportunity to make up for past mistakes. Therefore, Rongchu is grateful and should tighten personal life and work hard on company business, with the aspiration to work hard and bury his head in hard work, in order to comply with the government's economic construction policy, and to comfort the goodwill of those who maintain the industry. Moreover, he hopes that the stocks held by shareholders can gradually increase in value after hard work. Even for creditors, regardless of whether they have been resolved, he still hopes to repay them in the near future. He has now made this decision, selling his Shanghai residence to repay private debts, preparing to move into the factory, and focusing on business, with the goal of success. All kinds of private objects, except for a small number needed for family use, will be sent to the General Assembly for bidding, including all mahogany furniture, men's and women's leather clothing books, silver ware, etc., more than 500 pieces, and the proceeds will be donated. He humbly asks to pass it to the front lines to comfort the soldiers. He calls it a drop in the bucket and of no avail, but he hopes to accumulate sand into a tower and unite all efforts." (omitted below) It is also known that the association will host the press for the second time tomorrow, and will also separately host principals of large, medium, and small schools and the women's circle.</p>
<h3>A Portion of the Donated Items on Display</h3>
<h3>Song Ziwen Returns to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>National Economic Commission Standing Committee member Song Ziwen, who went to Beijing a few days ago to attend the Third Plenary Session and meet with Chairman Chiang, returned to Shanghai by Eurasia Company chartered plane at 11:00 AM yesterday. He arrived here at Longhua Airport at about 12:30 PM. After disembarking, Song went directly to his private residence on Qiqi Road to rest. Those who arrived in Shanghai on the same plane as Song yesterday included Health Department Director Liu Ruiheng, Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangshi, Songjiang Supervisory Deputy Envoy Song Zian, Secretary Chen Kangzhai, and eleven staff members.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Letter to Income Tax Office Requesting Concurrent Use of Cash Basis Accounting</h3>
<p>Considering Current Facts and Customs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce believes that the draft of the "Income Tax Collection Guidelines" stipulates the use of accrual basis accounting, which is inconvenient in terms of actual facts and customs. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Income Tax Affairs Office, suggesting the concurrent use of cash basis accounting. The original letter is as follows: Respectfully, during the convocation of the Income Tax Research Association, the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce raised a proposal regarding construction companies undertaking contracted projects. These projects often take several years to complete, and payments are made over several years as well. The question is whether the business income should be calculated based on the full contract amount or based on the actual revenue received during the year. At the same time, the local Construction Industry Trade Association also submitted a similar proposal, arguing that this matter should be standardized based on whether the collection guidelines adopt the cash basis or the accrual basis. Upon reviewing Article 9 of the current draft of the "Income Tax Collection Guidelines for Category One Profit-Seeking Enterprises," it states that "the total amount of revenue refers to the total income actually received and receivable from business operations." The word "and" connects "receivable" to "actually received," indicating that the draft still adopts the accrual basis. For business income that spans several years, calculating based on this standard would inevitably include revenue actually received in subsequent years into the current year, essentially requiring businesses to prepay the income tax due in subsequent years in the current year, which would be difficult for businesses. Therefore, we propose adding a proviso to the original text of Article 9: "However, based on factual or customary necessity, only the amount actually received may be calculated." And add a second item to this article: "If, in any year, an entity wishes to switch from using the provision in the proviso above to using the original text of the previous item to calculate its total revenue, it must declare to the competent authority within three months after the beginning of that year. However, those who calculate their total revenue according to the provision in the proviso above may only include the expenses already paid in the actual start." The above items are intended to suit the actual situation and avoid obstacles. We respectfully request your office to adopt and revise them immediately, which would be highly appreciated.</p>
<h3>Banking and Money Industries Withholding</h3>
<p>Income Tax on Deposit Interest</p>
<p>Following the Ministry's order, banks and money shops in this city will similarly withhold income tax on deposit interest, effective from January of this year. The withholding will be done when settling interest payments. This is convenient for ordinary deposits, making the withholding process quite easy. However, for special types of savings such as zero-deposit lump-sum withdrawals and interest-bearing capital savings, the calculation is more complex, and there are no detailed regulations in the collection guidelines. Therefore, the Income Tax Sub-Committee jointly formed by the banking and money industries is continuing to discuss the matter with the office. As for the interest on the funds of charitable organizations and educational savings accounts that is less than 100 yuan, the Income Tax Office has approved exemptions. The reporting procedures have also been agreed upon. In order to make this clear to all sectors, the two industries plan to jointly issue a public announcement within days to inform everyone.</p>

However, the situation remained peaceful until the evening. Night workers all went to the factory to work at 6 p.m., and no incidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Siamese Commercial Officer to China, Han Tao, Comes to Shanghai to Open Navigation Routes</h3>
<p>Arrives in Shanghai This Morning: Will Enter Beijing Shortly</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Sino-Siamese Association by both parties, which has been actively underway, all aspects of transportation, culture, and commerce are urgently seeking communication. Xu Ge Ting, an executive member of the Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to negotiate the expansion of the Chinese National Goods Company, and the progress is very smooth. However, Han Tao, the Siamese Commercial Officer to China, came to Shanghai via Hong Kong on the "Fisolo" ship to transfer to Beijing in order to plan for the opening of the Sino-Siamese shipping route. He will arrive in port this morning and then transfer to Beijing to discuss opening shipping routes with Ling Bing, the head of the delegation to Siam. Mr. Han once made a special trip to Shanghai and then to Beijing in November of last year, planning to raise 4 million yuan to form a shipping company, with Shanghai as the terminal, and to find ways to transport Siamese rice to North China. At that time, Chinese goods could also be continuously sold to Siam. He had a complete plan, but Ling Bing happened to be away from Beijing at the time, and there was no time to discuss it, resulting in no results. Now that Mr. Han is entering Beijing again, there may be preliminary negotiations.</p>

<h3>The Case of the Shanghai Grand Theatre Being Smashed Causes Negotiations Between the Soviet Union and the United States</h3>
<p>The Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Has Decided on a Response; The Shanghai Grand Theatre Maintains the Scene of Destruction; Hongkou Citizens' Association Believes It Is an Infringement on Sovereignty</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reported that the Shanghai Grand Theatre on North Sichuan Road was violently smashed by armed Italian sailors while showing the film "Abyssinia" at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, and the film was taken away. This incident damaged our national sovereignty and is highly valued by both China and foreign countries. Since the Shanghai Grand Theatre is mainly operated by Russian merchants and the film is operated by the American Asian Film Company, both parties have reported to the Soviet and American consulates, requesting serious negotiations. It is heard that the Soviet Consulate General in Shanghai, because the Consul General and Chargé d'Affaires, Pirwenlick, were in Beijing on official business at the time of the incident, immediately telegraphed a report. Mr. Pirwenlick, upon receiving the report, rushed back to Shanghai on the fast train the night before last. In addition to reporting the illegal actions of the Italian soldiers to Moscow, he has decided on a response plan. However, because yesterday was a Sunday holiday, there has been no development yet. As for the Shanghai Grand Theatre, after the engine room was smashed and the film was taken away by the Italian soldiers, it temporarily suspended business and kept the scene of destruction as it was, waiting for the Soviet Union and the United States to negotiate with the Italian Consulate. The 7th, 25th, 38th, and other sub-associations of the Hongkou District Citizens' Association of this city believe that the theater was violently smashed by Italian sailors, and the audience scrambled to escape at the time, causing great chaos and almost leading to a major disaster. This act hindered public security, and the Shanghai Grand Theatre is located in the extraterritorial road section, within the scope of our country's police power, and this unfortunate incident occurred today, which is particularly painful. Therefore, they jointly sent a letter to the Municipal Federation yesterday, forwarding it to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, demanding strict negotiations to ensure that similar incidents do not happen again, so as to strengthen social security.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Shanghai Times heard that the Shanghai Grand Theatre was smashed on Saturday afternoon by Italians led by an Italian consular official, so it sent a representative to visit the Italian Consul General, Mr. Nairoen. According to the answer, he had not received a report. The representative also asked Mr. Nairoen if he had made any comments on this matter. Mr. Nairoen replied that he had made absolutely no comments.</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the Italian Consul General stationed in Shanghai declared last night (Saturday) that he did not think the Shanghai Grand Theatre case was a serious one. He had not received any complaints from the police. The consular authorities had previously protested the opening of the film, and their actions were to avoid conflict. In the turmoil last night, Russian electrical technician Aziramovich had an arm broken. Mr. Aziramovich said, "I have been to Abyssinia from the United States and do not know why I was beaten." Yesterday afternoon, 200 Italians held a patriotic demonstration, which led to an international dispute. After the case, the Soviet Russian Consulate General in this city immediately telegraphed the Soviet Russian Embassy in Nanjing. Consul General Shi Cier Huanike received the report and immediately returned to Shanghai from Beijing that night and convened a meeting at the consulate late at night to discuss countermeasures. At the same time, the American Asia Film Company, the owner of the film "Abyssinia," has reported the case to the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai. What actions the U.S. consular authorities will take could not be ascertained last night.</p>

<h3>Anhui Construction Director Liu Yiyan Entered Beijing Yesterday</h3>

He has repeatedly negotiated with the Bank of Communications. According to reporters, the black tea loan belongs to both Anhui and Jiangxi provinces. The total loan is 2.5 million yuan, which has been agreed upon by both parties, and the contract has been drafted. It will be formally signed soon, and the funds will be allocated in mid-April and repaid in ten months. The collateral and other terms are roughly the same as in the past. Mr. Liu took the express train to Beijing at 4 p.m. yesterday to visit the Railway Department and other relevant authorities, seeking instructions on the construction of the He-Xin Railway (from Hefei, Anhui to Xinyang, Henan) in Anhui Province.

<h3>Charity Federation Joint Disaster Relief Council Plans to Allocate Disaster Relief Funds to Various Provinces</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Charity Federation Joint Disaster Relief Council, it has been actively handling disaster relief matters in the Sui border war zone for several months, sparing no effort. The disaster-stricken areas of other provinces have successively sent letters and telegrams requesting the Council to treat them equally and plan for the allocation of funds for relief, which is urgent. There are provinces such as Yu, Ji, Gan, and Ning. Henan Province suffered a particularly severe drought last year, with more than 90 disaster-stricken counties, and the disaster area accounted for nine-tenths of the province. The Chairman of the Provincial Chamber of Commerce, Zhen, and Director Liu Zhi, sent letters and telegrams requesting relief. Chairman Zhang Fang of the Relief Committee and Standing Committee member Zhi Zhen came to Shanghai to personally present the disaster situation and pleaded for the people. In addition, Chairman Mao Binfu of the Huaxian Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Qu Wanshan of the Shan County Drought Relief Council, and Chairman Duan Zhengze of the Huaiyang Relief Branch have successively sent letters and telegrams calling for help. The water and drought disasters in Ji Province affected 16 counties, including Daming and Wanping, with about 300,000 victims. Chairman Feng Zhi'an sent a special letter requesting the allocation of relief funds for rescue. The bandit disaster in Gansu Province was severe, with more than 50 affected counties, almost all over the province. Chairman Shui Zi of the Bandit Disaster Relief Council and Chairman Gao Wenwei of the Relief Committee came to Shanghai to earnestly request relief. The disaster area in Ningxia is vast, with a large number of victims, and they also requested the allocation of funds for relief. It is heard that the Council is making every effort to raise relief funds for the above-mentioned disaster-stricken areas in various provinces and submit them to the Standing Committee for allocation.</p>
<h3>Two Lakes Tea Production Situation Last Year</h3>
<p>Output Increased, Sales Decreased; More Than 40,000 Boxes Still in Stock at the End of the Year</p>
<p>The New News Agency reported that the International Trade Bureau announced that the black tea in the two lakes has always been a major product sold internationally, which is of great importance to the local economy. In recent years, due to the international market being seized, the sales volume has been decreasing day by day, and the market price has been gradually decreasing. It has already shown a slump. According to detailed investigation, although the output increased compared with the previous year, the sales volume decreased instead, and the only red tea produced is still in the process of collapse, lingering on its last breath.</p>
<p>In terms of production</p>
<p>The black tea in the two lakes in the Yunian year was delayed until June 1st due to the impact of spring rain. The larger producing areas in this province are Yichang, Yangloudong, and Niejiashi. The producing areas in Hunan Province are wider, including Anhua, Taoyuan, Gaoqiao, Xiangyin, Yongfeng, Liling, Loudi, Jiantian, Pingjiang, Changchou Street, and Liuyang. The total annual output is 188,425 boxes, which is an increase of 46,772 boxes compared with the previous year (24 years) of 141,653 boxes. Among them, Anhua has the largest output, followed by Lantian.</p>
<p>In terms of sales</p>
<p>In the past, it occupied an important position in the international trade market. In recent years, due to the impact of foreign tea dumping, it has been decreasing day by day. Last year, the British market was also deprived by foreign teas from India, Ceylon, Japan, etc., resulting in a slump in the export of national tea. Therefore, British merchants such as Taiping, Yihua, Xieji, Xiehe, Dude, Tianyu, Tianxiang, Russian merchants' assistance associations, German merchants such as Yucheng, and Dehua, etc., were all very weak. The market transaction was intermittent until the end of the year. Moreover, the silver and money industries closed accounts one after another, and investment was tightened, which caused the market to fall. In total, the annual sales volume, including the purchases of Shanghai, Shanxi, and other merchants and tea shops in this city, was 141,382 boxes. As of the end of last year, the production and sales were both off, and there were still 47,043 boxes that had not been sold.</p>
<p>In terms of market price</p>
<p>When the new tea started to be sold last year, the vendors in this city went to the producing areas to make Zhuang in advance and scramble to order, which led to a strange price. By the time it was transported to Hanzhong, the international trade market, based on the above-mentioned foreign tea dumping factors, the foreign merchants first wandered around and watched, and then absorbed the price. The merchants did not sell at a waiting price because they could not make a profit. Later, because of the heavy interest burden of the stack and the monthly interest, in order to avoid huge losses, they had to sell at a depreciated price, but many people suffered losses. For example, vendors in Lantian, Anhua, Gaoqiao, and Taoyuan were unwilling to sell when the new tea was on the market at a price of more than 50 yuan. By the end of the year, although the price was reduced to 27 yuan, no one asked. The merchants in Yangloudong, Zhangjiashi, Changchou Street, Pingjiang, and Liuyang also suffered slight losses. Only the tea sold by the Yichang merchants had excellent quality and was sold at the highest price of 91 yuan, each of which earned considerable profits. In addition, the tea pieces and floral fragrance were initially sold for more than ten yuan to more than twenty yuan, and now the floral fragrance is only sold for several yuan. According to the above, last year, except for the Yichang help who made a slight profit, the rest of the tea merchants suffered losses.</p>

<h3>Please Do Not Reduce Public Fees, Accountant Shen Liren</h3>
<p>A Letter Urging the Association to Thoroughly Consider the Aftermath</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, since the collection of income tax in our country, the business of accountants has gradually developed. However, due to competition among peers, public fees have been reduced. Mr. Shen Liren of the China Accounting Firm in this city has written to the Accountants Association to raise the status of accountants, saying: "Respectfully, I received a letter stating that some members of the association are arbitrarily reducing public fees, which damages the status of accountants. Please pay attention to it." After reading it, I deeply sympathize. However, I recently heard that some members of the association still cannot avoid superficially complying while actually opposing, or even going further, lowering their standards to solicit business, which is regrettable. Based on what I have heard, for example, a certain accountant has accepted the commission of a certain association to be the annual accounting consultant for fifty or sixty of its peers, including auditing, certifying statements, and submitting income tax returns on their behalf. However, their annual public fee is only 400 national currency, which means that each company only pays seven or eight yuan. If this continues to spread, other members will follow suit, and slogans such as "big gifts," "big discounts," and "competition regardless of cost" may appear in our industry. I think that when an accountant accepts a client's commission, they should also calculate the cost. Auditing and certifying statements cannot be done simply by stamping a seal. In other words, when encountering audit commissions, they must carefully examine whether the accounting methods of the business are appropriate and whether the financial situation is stable. These require careful consideration and cannot be done in a few hours. May I ask whether this meager annual fee of a few yuan is commensurate with its obligations and responsibilities? According to Article 19 of Chapter 5 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations on Penalties, those who conceal or make false reports will be subject to fines and imprisonment. It can be seen that accountants who act as agents for businesses in handling income tax are responsible for great responsibilities and should never be perfunctory and negligent. Therefore, the public fees charged must be appropriate according to the circumstances. If the above matters are true, the status of accountants will continue to decline, demeaning themselves. The future of this industry will be greatly hindered. If this trend continues, everyone will follow suit, and each will perfunctorily deal with matters at the lowest public fee. Then the actual work will not be honest, and the result will inevitably lead to the complete loss of the credibility of the accountants themselves, and the losses to the parties involved will also be significant. I urge your association to conduct a clear investigation and carefully consider the aftermath. This will not only be a blessing for this industry but also a blessing for the industrial and commercial sectors."</p>
<h3>Huang Zhenrong Shot</h3>
<p>The Hospital, Suspecting Him, Reported to the Police for Investigation</p>
<p>Huang Zhenrong from Shandong, 29 years old, lives at No. 13, Xiangsheng Lane, Xinqiao Road, Nanshi. Yesterday afternoon at about 7:40, he was sent to Renji Hospital on Shandong Road by two men because of a gunshot wound to his left foot. The two men left the hospital immediately, leaving only Huang in the hospital. After the hospital staff inquired about the circumstances of his injury, he claimed that he had previously worked at the Inland Water Company in this port but had been dismissed. Yesterday afternoon at about 7 o'clock, he was walking along Gaocheng Temple Coal Ash Road when he suddenly encountered three or four men who falsely claimed to be "copying targets" and robbed him of more than 50 yuan in cash and a camel hair robe he was wearing. At that time, he argued with the bandits, which resulted in him being shot in the left foot. Then, an acquaintance passed by and saw him, so he was sent to the hospital for treatment. When asked about the names of the two men who sent him, he said that he was only familiar with their faces and did not know anything else. However, the hospital did not know whether the circumstances were true, so it reported to the relevant police station. The police immediately dispatched detectives to take Huang to the police station for interrogation and investigate the facts for disposal.</p>
<h3>Russian Criminals in Lafayette Theatre Robbery Sentenced to Detention</h3>
<p>Several Russian bandits broke into the Lafayette Grand Theatre at the intersection of Lafayette Road and Beile Road in the French Concession last April and committed robbery. The thieves escaped. In September, the French police arrested a Russian thief named Buladofu (transliteration) and sent him to the Second Special Court for prosecution, declaring that he should be sentenced to more than two years in prison and sent to prison. Recently, the French police found that another member of the gang, a Russian named Weiqingsiji (transliteration), had fled to Tianjin. In the middle of last month, detectives were sent to Tianjin to arrest Weiqingsiji together with the local police detectives and brought him to Shanghai. He was sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and investigation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Later, after investigation by the Police Department, he was prosecuted according to law. After repeated court hearings by Sun Peng, the judge, it was finally determined that the defendant had only committed the act of receiving stolen goods in the robbery case. Therefore, the defendant was ordered to be brought to court the day before yesterday afternoon and sentenced to 40 days of detention for receiving stolen goods. He was found not guilty of robbery. During the appeal period, the defendant was transferred to the detention center.</p>

In July of the 22nd year, Hua became angry and deliberately accumulated rent, collected cash, and went out to make a living. He has been gone for three years, and there has been no news. Yuan Xingyue searched everywhere to no avail and placed an advertisement to find him, but it had no effect. Therefore, she hired lawyers Tao Ran and Lai Yuntao to sue Yu for divorce in the local court because she could not live and it was difficult to reunite. Yesterday, Judge Pang opened an extended hearing and learned that Yu lived on Tangshan Road, Hongkou, when he left. Therefore, it was ruled to be transferred to the First Special Court for handling.</p>

<h3>Memorial Service for the Fifth Anniversary of Short's Death to Be Held Today by People from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>Going to the Tomb at Hongqiao Airfield to Pay Respects</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, Major Short, a young American aviator, could not bear to see innocent Chinese women and children suffer in the "January 28th" Shanghai War. He was motivated by righteous indignation and automatically drove a fighter plane into the air to fight against six Japanese warplanes in the sky over Suzhou. He was outnumbered and killed, but the Japanese pilot was also killed by Short. When the Chinese people heard the news, they were all amazed and admired. Later, with the permission of Short's mother, the Chinese government built a tomb for him next to the Hongqiao Airfield in western Shanghai and erected a monument to commemorate him forever. Today is the fifth anniversary of Short's death. People from all walks of life initiated a memorial service to mourn Short's chivalrous spirit of sacrificing himself for our country. Therefore, representatives will be sent by various agencies to pay respects at Short's tomb at Hongqiao Airfield today. Short was from Washington, USA. After practicing aviation in Hollywood, California, he obtained the rank of major in the US Air Force. He came to China a year before his death and worked as a pilot for airmail in Guangdong. He was well-known to senior officers of the 19th Route Army.</p>
<h3>China Foreign Famine Relief Association Handles Drought Prevention Well-Digging Loans</h3>
<p>Simple Application Procedures Convenient for Farmers, Hoping Banks Will Invest Widely</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the China Foreign Famine Relief Association has allocated 30,000 yuan from the cooperative base fund to help farmers in Hebei Province to carry out drought prevention well-digging loans. Farmers have benefited from this. It is hoped that the banking sector will invest and widely implement measures to prevent drought and regulate rural areas. The details of the association's handling of well-digging loans are as follows:</p>
<p>Drought Well Loan</p>
<p>The scope of the loan is temporarily set as Hebei Province. The loan method is that any self-cultivating farmer with five to fifty acres of land, whether or not a member of a cooperative, can apply for a loan. The cooperative is responsible for the loan. The responsibilities of the loan are: ㊀ Investigate the soil quality of the well-digging site and prove that the applicant does need a loan to handle it. ㊁ Record the accounts of the loans issued. ㊂ Supervise the use of the loans. ㊃ Remind the repayment of overdue loans. Since the implementation, farmers have found it convenient. Last year's loans were used to dig 82 wells. One household failed, and 81 wells were actually dug. 7,162 yuan in national currency were lent out. This year, more than 600 people applied to the association. Fifty wells have been approved, and 4,610 yuan in national currency is needed.</p>
<p>Meng Well Loan</p>
<p>In order to honor Liang Mengting, the former president and current honorary president, the association established the "Mengting Memorial Fund" in November of the 19th year of the Republic of China, which specializes in lending money to farmers for well-digging and disaster prevention. In addition to Liang Jun's donation of 1,000 yuan, the fund was raised from donations from all parties and appropriations from disaster relief funds. Initially, it was only more than 3,500 yuan, but now it has accumulated to 6,817.78 yuan. The total amount of loans issued over the years has reached 12,446 yuan, and 138 wells have been dug. This year, farmers in Hebei Province have requested loans from the association to dig wells in 266 cases. After deliberation by the Cooperative Affairs Committee, 25 wells were approved, with each loan ranging from 80 to 100 yuan, totaling 2,342 yuan in national currency.</p>

<h3>Yesterday, Heavy Fog in the City Blocked Sea and Air Traffic</h3>
<p>More Than Ten Jianghai Ships Were Blocked En Route, China Aviation's Shanghai-Hankou and Shanghai-Pingjin Planes Did Not Take Off, and the Beijing-Shanghai Night Express Arrived Late</p>
<p>The fog in this port was thin as smoke the day before yesterday and did not dissipate all day. By midnight, it became even thicker. As of yesterday, it still had not dissipated. Traffic was greatly affected. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Fog Suddenly Turned Heavy Yesterday</p>
<p>Starting the night before yesterday, the fog suddenly turned heavy. At dawn yesterday, it was raining again, and the condensation was even worse. It was impossible to see people's faces even at close range. After the trams on various roads in the Public Concession left the factory, they all drove with their lights on. Other cars and streetcars did the same, and they all drove slowly to avoid collisions. The dim situation was like twilight. The heavy fog dissipated slightly in the afternoon, but it still had not dissipated by night.</p>
<p>Maritime Traffic Was Blocked</p>
<p>Jianghai ships were the first to be affected by the heavy fog. According to a survey by the ship import office of the Bund Customs, as of 6 pm, only five ships had arrived, namely Xinningshao, Xinningyu, Zhoushan, Zhida, and Suda on the coastal line. According to news from the customs import office, more than ten ships, including Haili, were blocked en route and outside the port. As for outgoing ships, as of 6 pm, only a few ships, such as Gongping, Fengtian Maru, and Maanshan Maru, had sailed out after the fog dissipated. However, yesterday happened to be Sunday, and the customs stopped closing, so the impact was small.</p>
<p>Planes Delayed and Trains Delayed</p>
<p>China Aviation's Shanghai-Hankou Westbound and Shanghai-Pingjin Northbound planes were unable to take off yesterday and were rescheduled to fly this morning. The Shanghai-Hankou Eastbound plane arrived in Shanghai as usual at 4:30 pm yesterday. It is also known that the Beijing-Shanghai Night Express arrived at the North Station after 7 am yesterday, also delayed due to the fog.</p>
<h3>Yu Jiabao Invented a Water Yacht</h3>
<p>Planning to Sail on West Lake, Submitting to Hangzhou for Approval</p>
<p>Yu Jiabao and Wu Zhipei of No. 54, Renqing Lane, Huade Road, in this city, have a deep understanding of mechanical science. Recently, they invented a water yacht, which is exquisitely constructed. They now plan to sail on the Fourth Lake in Hangzhou to meet the needs of tourists. The original text of the application to the Hangzhou authorities for record is recorded below: "Submitting a request to approve the invention and issue a business license for the invented water yacht, along with the attached manufacturing drawings, in order to prepare for business. The inventors have recently invented a water yacht, which is solidly constructed and driven by human pedaling. It travels safely and steadily on the water surface, can be slow or fast, and can turn freely. Even if there are wind and waves on the water surface, it is still stable and there is no danger of capsizing. West Lake in Hangzhou is famous throughout the country. Every spring, summer, and autumn, Chinese and foreign tourists come to Hangzhou to visit the lake. Ladies gather in large numbers. However, the old-fashioned boats on the lake are of uneven width and simple construction, lacking safety equipment. They are moved by rowing oars, and in case of risk, they drift with the waves, which is dangerous. Tourists who want to rent a boat to swim on the shore will inevitably feel frightened when the wind blows and the waves rise in the lake. In order to promote the safety of swimming on the shore, the inventors have specially launched 20 water yachts and established a 'Hangzhou Yan Lake Water Yacht Office' to provide tourists with boats. These yachts have beautiful cabins and low rental prices. They are magnificent and safe. The sailors are strictly trained and skilled, and the management is meticulous. However, this is a pioneering event. Therefore, we specially submit a sample of the yacht and a drawing of the construction instructions, requesting your bureau to promote the invention of new-style yachts and ensure the safety of tourists, so that the 'West Lake' will shine with a different luster. Please approve the record and issue a business license, so that we can start manufacturing and preparing. We beg you to approve it within a short time."</p>
<h3>A Coolie Named Yi Changyi Suddenly Became an Official</h3>
<p>Huang Yiming Sold Official Positions and Defrauded Money, and Became a Prisoner After the Incident Was Exposed</p>
<p>A man named Zhou Kewu opened a room in the Dadong Hotel in this city in January of this year, falsely claiming to be the director of the Dapan Mountain Local Office of the Zhejiang Pacification Commissioner's Office, and sent Huang Yiming from Nantong to swindle and cheat outside, recruiting detectives, saying that the positions of detectives could work throughout China. Therefore, Sun Caigen, Ling Jiesheng, Ji Youyu, Liu Wenshi, etc., who worked in Shanghai, were</p>
<p>Bewitched by Huang Yiming</p>
<p>They were willing to apply and raised more than 200 yuan in national currency as sports fees. As a result, each of them received a fake letter of appointment. Sun and others had worked hard as coolies every day and were looked down upon. Once they were lucky and became officials, they were overjoyed. They changed into long gowns and first returned to their hometown to brag to the villagers, which was like a triumphant return. They received praise from the elders in their hometown. After staying for a few days, they gathered again and returned to Shanghai, bought a pistol, and then</p>
<p>At the Nanshi Wharf in This City</p>
<p>Exercised their duties to inspect passengers. Unexpectedly, they inspected a water police officer and were arrested and sent to the local court for interrogation. Zhou Kewu fled when he heard the news, and Huang Yiming dared to ignore the law and defrauded the families of Sun and others of dozens of yuan in national currency, saying that he would go to the court to rescue Sun and others. After checking, there was no news. The families of Sun and others were looking for him, and Huang Yiming dared to</p>
<p>Commit Fraud a Second Time</p>
<p>When he was sent to the court by the arresting police, the truth was revealed. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu prosecuted Huang Yiming for forgery and fraud. Sun Caigen, Lu Jiesheng, Ji Youyu, Liu Wenbao, etc., were not guilty of impersonating public officials because they were deceived. However, they did not have a license to hold firearms, so they should be prosecuted. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zongxing heard the case. Huang Yiming said that he also thought that Zhou Kewu was indeed an official, so he was deceived and asked for leniency. Sun and others all claimed to have been deceived and asked for forgiveness. After extended debate, the sentence was scheduled to be pronounced. Huang Yiming was sent back to prison, and Sun, Lu, Ji, and Liu were allowed to be released on bail.</p>
<h3>Qianye Guild to Hold Annual Meeting Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Li Weining Recited Songs in the Lyceum Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chinese musician Li Weining had studied diligently with world-renowned pianists Shuang Buli Xi and composer Weige. He had studied in France and Austria for six years and was deeply skilled. Moreover, his compositions were often performed by foreigners. Yesterday afternoon at 5 pm, the Public Concession Engineering Bureau invited Li to perform at the Lyceum Theatre.

This song was written by the famous composer Mausat and is divided into three chapters, alluding to the composer's life and his encounters, sometimes happy, sometimes sad, tense and enthusiastic. The emotions of the audience shifted, and it did not end until about 7 o'clock. It is heard that the Engineering Bureau Orchestra will perform Li's large musical composition next week.</p>
<h3>Zhang Hu, Members of the Seafarer's Party Department, Return to Shanghai After Inspection</h3>
<p>In order to understand the actual situation of the seafarer's party affairs and labor movement in all districts of the country, Yang Xiaotian, a special commissioner of the Special Party Department of the Chinese Seafarers, specially sent Zhang Donglin, the director of the General Affairs Section of the department, to inspect the Yangtze River Line in early January of this year, passing through Zhenjiang, Yanhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, Changsha, and Yichang. Hu Qi, the director of the Vocational Training Section, inspected the coastal line, passing through Ningbo, Qingdao, Hong Kong, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and other ports. Zhang and Hu returned successively the day before yesterday. They are now compiling the inspection report. It is heard that the party workers in each district are working hard under the leadership of Yang, so the results are all good.</p>
<h3>Huade Invented a High-Pressure Electric Machine</h3>
<p>Able to Test the Life of Bulbs</p>
<p>In recent years, the domestic and foreign bulb business on the market has become very developed. Which is durable and long-lasting, which can save electricity, and which is brighter, it is worth ignoring. Now look at the true facts and do not use false advertisements as a slogan. Li Qingxiang, the assistant and chief engineer of the Huade Bulb Factory, knowing that there are many types of bulbs on the market, wants to test their brightness and power saving, which is still easy, but to test the length of the life of the bulb is not easy. Therefore, he spent several days of hard work and experience, starting with a wide range of tests, and finally succeeded in building a high-pressure electric machine that can test the life of any brand of bulb in the shortest time, whether short or long, it is known immediately. I visited yesterday and learned the truth. It is found that the lighting time of each bulb has always been set to 1,000 hours, that is, the preparation must be useless. As for the applicable power of each bulb, it is also determined like the age of a person, depending on the amount of energy. Yesterday, when Mr. Li tested his newly invented high-pressure electric machine, he first screwed the 40-watt Huade bulb produced by his factory into the lamp holder on the machine, and then screwed a bulb of the same 40-watt of a certain brand into another lamp holder lined up. At this time, he had first tested on the illuminometer and obtained Huade power 1210, voltage 180, and luminescence 5.5. At the same time, he also obtained the power of a certain brand 6220, voltage 182, and luminescence 5.5. Comparing the two, there is no difference. Then, he started the lower standard gear and increased the power by using the high-pressure method. When he opened it to 210 degrees, he immediately urged the bulb to quickly enter the path of death. At this time, the light was so bright that it almost doubled the original brightness. Immediately, the lamp also showed signs of burning and separation. After an hour, the preparations for which were short and which were long were immediately divided. On the test table, it was calculated that Huade was from 10:00 to 11:23, and a certain brand was from 10:00 to 11:14. Calculating the life of Huade bulbs, it was 9 minutes longer than a certain brand. After testing another bulb of a certain brand, it was damaged immediately without even a test. From this, it can be seen that the repeatedly tested and verified Huade old brand bulbs have long been obvious facts and cannot be compared with empty propaganda and mixing fish eyes with pearls. It is also heard that the factory welcomes people from all walks of life to visit and test or send people out to test to verify the truth of the facts. However, you must first send a letter to the factory at No. 196, Ouyang Road, Zhabei, this port, to contact, so as not to lose the hospitality. It is hoped that those who care about domestic products will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A (12)</h3>
<p>Question: When I communicate with various parties, sometimes the correspondence involves money entanglements and causes legal procedures. Every time the court extracts the original letter for inspection, it is because the other party (the recipient) has lost or concealed the original letter and cannot hand it over, resulting in a lack of evidence and no way to argue. If I keep a copy of each letter I send and present it as evidence when the time comes, because the copy is saved by myself and no one proves that the words and names are the same as the original letter, it cannot be effective. I read in the Q&amp;A compiled by your company that there is a notarized letter in the business handled by the post office. I don't know if it is applicable to the above matters. What are the delivery procedures? Please tell me in detail.</p>
<p>Answer: The notarized letters received and sent by various postal administrations and first-class post offices are originally designed to enable the sender to copy one or several copies of the letters sent, and submit one copy to the original post office for future reference and evidence. Those who send such letters should write in Chinese with a brush or fountain pen, or print the original in one copy and the copy in one copy with a printing machine, typewriter, or copying machine. The sender should sign and seal, and the post office staff will check the words and sentences in the original and copy against each other. If they are correct, the staff will indicate in the original and copy "Certified by the XXX Post Office on XXX year, XXX month, and XXX day that the text content is exactly the same as the copy" and "Certified by the XXX Post Office on XXX year, XXX month, and XXX day that the text content is exactly the same as the original", sign and seal, number them, and affix the post office date stamp (the seal must also be affixed to the binding of the original and copy). The original copy will be sealed on the spot and sent to the sender in an envelope for registration or express registration along with a receipt. All two copies of the copy will be kept by the post office for notarization, and the remaining one will be returned to the sender for safekeeping (if the sender does not want to keep the copy, only one copy is needed, not two copies).</p>
<p>The copy should indicate the detailed address of the sender and the recipient. Each page should have at most eight lines, and each line should have at most thirty characters. If there are any erasures, additions, or deletions, the sender should indicate at the end of the copy or on a separate sheet of paper "In the X page, X line, the X word has been erased, added, or deleted X words", affix a seal, and the number of additions, deletions, and erasures on each page should not exceed twenty words. The copy kept for notarization will be kept by the original post office for three years from the date of submission. During this period, if the sender wants to consult it, they should fill in an application form, attach the registration or express registration receipt obtained at the time of submission, and send it to the bureau for review, along with the reading fee. After each reading, the postman will indicate in the copy "Read at the request of the sender on XXX year, XXX month, and XXX day", sign and seal, and affix the post office date stamp. If the sender wants to make another copy or several copies according to the original copy and requests proof that the content is completely consistent with the original copy, the post office can also provide proof, and the postman will indicate on the original copy and the added copy "Invented at the request of the sender on XXX year, XXX month, and XXX day" and "The original was notarized on XXX year, XXX month, and XXX day, numbered X, and the content and text of the previous copy are completely consistent with this copy", sign and stamp as proof.</p>
<p>All fees to be paid for submission, request for reading, and request for proof of additional copies, as well as other procedures, are detailed in the Postal Regulations and the attached Postal Rate Table.</p>
<h3>Spring Cold Still Severe, Shelters Closing Slowly</h3>
<p>Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Committee members Wang Yiting, Huang Jinzhi, Gu Xinyi, Qu Wenliu, and other Buddhist lay practitioners organized temporary shelters last winter. The Chaozhou Guild Hall in Nanshi housed over 3,000 civilians, mostly refugees from disaster-stricken provinces such as Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, followed by Henan, Shandong, and unemployed impoverished locals. The elderly, weak, disabled, and orphans were also sheltered. The daily rice consumption exceeded twenty stones. The shelters have been operating for over two months, with Mr. Zhang Zixin in charge of all management and supplies. Although it is now spring, the weather remains cold, and the sheltered civilians have no means of livelihood upon leaving. Therefore, over 2,000 people remain in the shelters. After discussion, the committee decided to wait for warmer weather before closing the shelters. Chairman Wang of the National Government has diligently solicited funds for the shelters and enthusiastically presided over the effort. Donations have poured in from all sectors, including Shanghai Municipal Government's subsidy of 2,000 yuan, the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Society's 4,000 yuan, Lin Bingyan's 2,000 yuan, the Shanghai Charity Group's 6,000 yuan, and over 7,000 yuan from other charitable organizations and philanthropists. From the beginning to February 10th of this year, a total of over 21,000 yuan in national currency has been collected. Their compassion for the impoverished is admirable. Director Zhang has strived for economy in all expenditures, providing weekly public reports. As many impoverished people remain in the shelters, relief will be extended until the end of March, weather permitting. We hope all sectors will generously donate to aid the relief effort, accumulating boundless merit.</p>
<h3>Xu Zhicheng's Gold Jewelry Theft Case, Even His Mother Hopes for Severe Punishment</h3>
<p>Court Lectures Son with Both Words and Expressions; Sentenced to Three Months, Suspended for Three Years</p>
<p>Xu Yuehua, a female student at the Shenmei Girls' Middle School from Hangzhou, 11 years old, and her younger brother Xu Zhicheng, reside at No. 8, Tongchunfang, Lane 228, Baike Road. On the evening of the 11th of this month, at 9:30 PM, Xu Zhicheng took advantage of his sister's absence to steal a gold bracelet worth 130 yuan and 40 yuan in legal tender. He then went to Jiaxing with friends Hu Shijie and Mao Jinmao.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Xu's money in Jiaxing was taken by Mao and Hu, forcing Xu Zhicheng to return home. Xu Yuehua reported the incident to the New Patrol Station, which dispatched Detective Ye Yushan to arrest Zhicheng and send him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the case was further investigated by Judge Zhan of the First Special District Court in criminal court. Patrol Station lawyer Jiang Baolian stated that after the defendant stole the bracelet, he pawned it at the Dacheng Pawnshop in Huajin Lane, Jiujiang Road, for 90 yuan. Afterwards, the defendant's</p>
<p>entire sum</p>
<p>was stolen by Hu and Mao in Jiaxing. Mao and others then used the pawn ticket to redeem the bracelet at the Dacheng Pawnshop, so the bracelet cannot be retrieved. Xu Yuehua was unable to attend due to illness, so her mother, Xu Chen, attended in her place. According to her statement, Xu Yuehua has been sick since the incident, refusing to eat for two days out of anger. Therefore, she could not attend court today. The defendant is my son, and previously in Hangzhou,</p>
<p>he fell in with bad company</p>
<p>and stole my gold jewelry. In the end, even the long gown he was wearing was swindled away before he returned home. At that time, I sternly rebuked him, telling him to leave some face for his parents and to separate from his bad friends. Therefore, I had him come to Shanghai with his sister to study, hoping he could reform. Unexpectedly, he did not change his ways and committed this crime again. This son is truly incorrigible. If I cannot teach him,</p>
<p>can he still be considered my son? Therefore, I request the court</p>
<p>to impose a severe punishment. She also presented to the court a photo of the defendant colluding with bad friends to break into places in Hangzhou. The court then questioned Xu Zhicheng about the events in Hangzhou. Xu also bowed his head in silent acknowledgement, only asking the court to sentence him justly and promising never to commit the crime again and to reform. Xu Chen sternly rebuked Xu Zhicheng in court, both in words and expression. Finally, Judge Zhan Liangce announced the verdict: Xu Zhicheng is sentenced for theft to</p>
<p>three months of imprisonment,</p>
<p>suspended for three years, and ordered to be taken back and disciplined by Xu Chen. After the verdict, he cautioned Xu Zhicheng, saying that if he continued his evil ways, not only would the three-month sentence still be enforced, but he would also be severely punished. Xu nodded in agreement, but Xu Chen seemed unwilling to take him back for discipline. After some persuasion, she finally agreed to comply with the verdict and take him back.</p>
<h3>Special District Rickshaw Guild Prepares to Petition Today</h3>
<p>Request Education Funds to Be Paid from Mutual Aid Funds; Regular Joint Meetings to Be Held After Mutual Aid Association Reorganization</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Special District Rickshaw Guild will petition the Public Works Department and Social Bureau today regarding funding for rickshaw pullers' literacy education. Regular meetings of the Mutual Aid Association will be held to discuss revisions to the articles of association. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Requesting Funds from Mutual Aid Funds</p>
<p>Since the Social Bureau set a one-year plan to implement literacy education for rickshaw pullers starting March 1st, it has stipulated that the expenses will be borne by the rickshaw owners, with each rickshaw paying 3 jiao per month. As the rickshaw owners cannot afford this burden, they resolved in a general meeting the other day to appoint Hou Shao'an, Gu Songmao, Wang Kunyi, Ban Zhiling, Xu Jinbiao, Cai Shengnan, Qiu Jiran, Zhao Rongfu, Zhao Fengshan, Zheng Chengquan, and others to petition the Public Works Department and the Mutual Aid Association Council today, requesting that 3,000 yuan be allocated from the mutual aid funds to the Social Bureau each month as education funds for rickshaw pullers. They will also petition the Social Bureau to directly negotiate with the Public Works Department for funding to promote rickshaw pullers' literacy education.</p>
<p>Deadline Extended for Rickshaw Registration</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Guild, because the Public Works Department has extended the deadline for reducing the number of rickshaws by three months, notified all members to attend the meeting to register the exact number of rickshaws. However, the addresses of a few rickshaw owners have changed, making it impossible to deliver the notices. Therefore, it is announced again that reports must be made to the Guild by the 25th. As for the matter of sharing the losses, the previous Guild regulations stipulated a levy of 15 yuan per rickshaw. For those who have more than 10 rickshaws, one rickshaw will be reduced for every additional ten rickshaws. Yesterday, it was further announced that small rickshaw owners with less than 10 rickshaws who are unwilling to contribute funds but are willing to contribute rickshaws must register with the Guild by the 25th to be reported. Otherwise, the established policy of sharing the losses will be followed.</p>
<p>Regular Meetings of Mutual Aid Association</p>
<p>Since the reorganization of the Public Concession Public Works Department Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, all directors and supervisors have been sworn in. However, the internal organization has been changed, and the original articles of association are no longer suitable. It is anticipated that the number of rickshaws within the concession will be reduced by 484 on June 1st. Therefore, it has been decided to convene a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 2:00 PM on the 23rd (Tuesday) to discuss revisions to the articles of association and the work outline for this year.</p>
<h3>Xue Mailuo Robbery Case, Robbers Cause Deep Harm</h3>
<p>Zhang Zuming and Three Others Initially Wronged; Wealthy Merchant Jin Injured by Fright</p>
<p>The French Patrol Station's Chinese and foreign detectives went to Mr. Jin's house near the Slaughterhouse Company on the morning of the 20th to search for robbers, causing Mr. Jin to fall and injure himself due to fear. This has been briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the four robbers Huang Aying, Huang Xixiang, Wang Zhengji, and Fang Quangui, who robbed accountant Xue Mailuo's office of 12,000 yuan on June 9th of the 33rd year of the Republic, were arrested for robbing three money houses and shooting the owner in the Public Concession with Pan Weisheng and four others. The First Special District Court sentenced Pan to death, Huang Aying to 18 years, Huang Xixiang to 14 years, Wang Zhengji to 11 years, and Fang Quangui to 10 years, and they are serving their sentences in prison. The four robbers confessed to the warden that they had robbed Mr. Xue Mailuo's office of a large sum of money with the fugitive Shen Fugui. Last September, they robbed three businesses, including the Shaanxi Bank at No. 49 Huangpu Bund. After being notified, the French Patrol Station sent detectives to bring the four robbers back for interrogation and investigation by the Second Special District Court. The hearing has been rescheduled to the 26th of this month. This has also been reported in detail in this newspaper. During the investigation, the robbers confessed that their accomplices were hiding in House No. 10, Ningfuli, Slaughterhouse Company. Therefore, at 7:00 AM on the 20th, a team of detectives led by the Fourth Division secretly went to House No. 10, Ningfuli, Slaughterhouse Company, to surround and arrest them. Mr. Jin, the resident of the house, suspected that he was being robbed, climbed onto the drying platform, intending to jump into the Zheng family's residence to avoid it. Due to panic, he fell from a great height, severely injuring his head and other parts of his body. As a result, they found nothing related to the robbers and sent the injured man to the hospital for treatment. After the robbery of Mr. Xue Mailuo's office, Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Xumeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue were initially implicated and wrongly accused. Now the truth has come to light, and Mr. Jin has been innocently injured, all due to the crimes of these robbers. The ringleader of the Xue Mailuo robbery, Shen Fugui, is still at large. It is reported that the patrol station has requested the court to issue an arrest warrant and requested the assistance of various police agencies and inland military police to bring him to justice.</p>

<h3>Municipal Zoo Rabbit Exhibition Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Over 38,000 Visitors; Ministry of Education Sends Personnel to Film; All Results Have Been Evaluated and Announced; Products from Minsheng Company are the Best</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Rabbit Exhibition closed yesterday. The results of the exhibits have also been evaluated by experts and are satisfactory. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Closed Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday was the fourth day of the exhibition. The total number of visitors over the four days is estimated to be over 38,000. The local Chinese Agricultural Bookstore distributed "Rabbit Raising Essentials" vouchers at the exhibition. Approximately 3,100 people presented vouchers to the bookstore to collect books, demonstrating the public's attention to the rabbit raising industry. The Ministry of Education sent personnel to the exhibition the day before yesterday to film an educational film for promotion and publicity. The exhibition closed at 5:00 PM yesterday, and the exhibits will be returned starting today.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>Director Shen of the Municipal Zoo invited evaluators Cai Wuji, Wang Guangxuan, Feng Huanwen, Jiang Shaohuai, Zhang Ruizhi, Xian Chuncao (representing Yi Minglun), Shu Shubei, and Chen Rongding to the zoo at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss evaluation methods and criteria. In the afternoon, they began to evaluate each exhibit, recording scores for weight, length, rabbit hair tensile strength, and the quality of manufactured products. An average score of 60 or more was considered Grade A, 70 or more was considered Excellent, and 80 or more was considered Superior.</p>
<p>Overall Results</p>
<p>The overall results, signed by the evaluators, are officially announced as follows: ㊀ Wool Rabbits (AnBoro) Superior: Minsheng Agricultural Company, Lida Academy Farm, Heming Rabbit Farm. Excellent: Chinese Boy Scouts Group 1334 Rabbit Raising Team, Fumin Farm, Jiangsu Zhaizhi Farm. Grade A: Hangyun Rabbit Experiment Farm, Family Rabbit Raising Society, Zhonghua Farm, Fang Shutian. ㊁ Dual-Purpose Rabbits Superior: Chen Bingji (Lilac ReRex), Lida Academy Farm (Broine Rex). Excellent: Lida Academy Farm (Memish), Heming Rabbit Farm (hybrid), Chen Bingji (Lilac Rex).

Grade A: San San Farm (rabbit floss).</p>
<p>Expert Interviews</p>
<p>The Datong News Agency interviewed experts Feng Huanwen, Jiang Shaohuai, and Zhang Ruizhi regarding their opinions on the results of the exhibition. They learned that this is the rabbit breeding season, so the appearance of the rabbits may be inferior to usual. However, China's rabbit raising industry is still in its infancy and needs to be promoted to boost the rural economy. Therefore, the evaluation criteria were not strict to align with the original purpose of the exhibition. Overall, the results are good.</p>

<h3>Wan Bang Cotton Weaving Factory Increases Price Of Towels</h3>
<p>Over one hundred Wan Bang cotton weaving factories, including Darong, Hongfa, Guancheng, Yixianggang Huade, Yuchang, and Shengyi along Kongjiang Road and Xinshi Village, increased the prices of their products such as towel quilts, towels, and bedsheets because the raw materials of yarn and thread were too expensive, increasing production costs. In order to maintain operations and account for costs, in addition to the three established weaving and dyeing joint sales offices (Sanming, Tongyi, Zhongyang, and Dagong) in the vicinity of Hankou Road, Hubei Road, Yingchunfang, and Zhejiang Road to unify selling prices, recently decided to increase prices by 10-15% of the original selling price.</p>

They threatened him and robbed him of 6 yuan in legal tender and over 1 yuan in small bills that he had on him. The three robbers, still unsatisfied, forced him to take off his thread-lined camel velvet robe, cotton-padded jacket, and velvet rope shirt. When Qu resisted, the robbers became angry and stabbed his right hand and face, causing profuse bleeding. The three robbers then whistled, grabbed their loot, and scattered. Afterwards, Qu reported the incident to the police.</p>

<h3>Unification and Peace (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will question why foreigners can unite. Isn't the United States of America a federal country? Indeed, the United States is a federal country, but first, are the American troops freely commanded and directed by each state? Although the United States is a federation, all its land, sea, and air forces are completely commanded and directed by the central federal government. Second, is American diplomacy handled by each state itself? American diplomacy is entirely the responsibility of the central federal government. It is definitely not the case that New York State is responsible here and Washington State is responsible there, like our Hebei-Chahar government being able to establish a separate foreign affairs committee. In short, although the United States is a federation, major powers such as diplomacy, military affairs, finance, and civil administration are still concentrated in the central federal government. Therefore, the United States of America is truly a unified country. Their many states were originally independent small states. Only with this organization and this government did they unite the small states. They truly used the federal system to unify America. What about China? China was originally a unified country. Why insist on recognizing that it is divided into many units and then unite them? This is like a person who, even if their limbs have localized illnesses, can be cured, but instead, one insists on cutting off their limbs and then connecting them together, calling it unification. Is this a clever approach? Even if China were to become a federal country, first, China's many provinces must be as small as the American states, without the qualifications to become independent countries, so that local governments cannot independently dominate. Second, China must first fully concentrate military, political, financial, civil, foreign, and educational powers in the central government. Then, it can avoid the ills of local separatism. But if this is achieved, then it has already become a unified country in name and in fact. Why create the name of "union"?</p>
<p>Then, who is advocating seeking peace through "union"? "Union" is a term borrowed by the Chinese Communist Party. They say to unite all parties and factions to work together to resist the enemy and save the country. How good this sounds. But we must investigate how they intend to unite. They say to recognize the Chinese Soviet government, designate areas as the defense zones of the Soviet Red Army, and have the Red Army be mobilized and commanded by the Soviet government. I ask, is the Soviet government the government of China? Is the Red Army the army of China? If it is the government of China, why not stand under the National Government but establish a separate government? If it is the army of China, why not be incorporated under the flag of the Chinese National Army, using the National Army's designations? In one country, can different government organizations and different military systems be tolerated in order to unite? Can peace be achieved through union? Then, aren't the traitors in Manchuria and Eastern Hebei all Chinese? As a joke, can't they also hide under the banner of "union" and demand peace from us? What basis do we have to eliminate traitors? Under the slogan of "united front," they also have a saying that Chinese people should not fight Chinese people. This is correct, but if this statement comes from the mouths of traitors to block our suppression and recovery of lost territories, if Yin Rugeng says Chinese people should not fight Chinese people, and if Puyi also says Chinese people should not fight Chinese people, then China will never be unified. Therefore, this statement can only come from the mouths of voluntarily surrendering rebels. Once they are enlightened, not used by foreign enemies, and understand that Chinese people should not fight Chinese people, they quickly surrender to the central government and request incorporation, like the generals of Wang Ying's border defense forces. Only then can the saying that Chinese people should not fight Chinese people be justified. Why? Because this promotes unification. Conversely, if the Red bandits or rebel generals use this statement to prevent the central National Army's suppression and advance, it is to protect separatism and destroy unification. How can there be peace to speak of? Therefore, based on these seemingly correct slogans, falsely calling for union is not enough to achieve peace. Only unification can achieve true peace. The so-called "union" is false, deceptive, and merely aims to use this slogan to struggle for survival and development. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Small Talk</p>
<h3>Three Pounds Twelve Ounces of Shackles</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The methods used to punish criminals in prisons have always been quite well-thought-out. Imprisoning them in jails and adding shackles seems to be necessary to deter bad people. The instruments of torture used in our country's prisons today may have discarded the cangue, but shackles still exist. The cangue is a neck restraint, traditionally made of dry wood, three feet long and two feet nine inches in diameter, weighing twenty-five pounds. Adding this instrument of torture to a prisoner's neck is truly unbearable. Shackles are foot locks, of various sizes and weights, which are unknown. However, according to a recent circular from the Ministry of Justice, the heaviest foot shackles must not exceed three pounds and twelve ounces, and all provincial courts are ordered to forward this to all prisons for strict compliance, prohibiting misuse, etc. Attaching several pounds of iron shackles to a prisoner's feet, the pain is also imaginable.</p>
<p>In general, prisons often treat prisoners cruelly, always fearing that their punishment is not severe enough. Regarding the foot shackles, since the Ministry of Justice says that misuse is not allowed, it is clear that there was "misuse" before. Originally, when a person commits a crime, being confined in prison already deprives them of all freedom. If various punishments are inflicted, it further increases their suffering. This time, the Ministry of Justice's circular, stipulating that the heaviest foot shackles must not exceed three pounds and twelve ounces, can be considered an act of kindness to prisoners, with very good intentions.</p>
<p>However, even three pounds and twelve ounces of shackles are unbearable for prisoners. If they could be discarded, would the prisoners not be greatly benefited? Recently, the treatment of prisoners in prisons in various countries has improved significantly. Not only are punishments not inflicted, but various preferential treatments are also given to reduce the suffering of ordinary prisoners. It is said that some prisons do not confine prisoners but only order them to work in a specific place. But the results are very good, and the prisoners are able to be law-abiding. From this, it can be seen that punishment is not the best way to discipline prisoners.</p>
<p>Some time ago, some people wanted to solve the problem of prisoners' sexual desires, advocating that prisoners should be given opportunities to satisfy their sexual desires within a certain period. Some people agreed, and some people opposed. However, in my opinion, a prisoner confined in prison, suffering all kinds of pain, the desire for sex may not be very strong. If these three pounds and twelve ounces of shackles could be removed instead, the prisoners would be extremely grateful.</p>
<h3>After Leaving the Reformatory</h3>
<p>— Fang Kewen</p>
<p>The National Child Welfare Association's work of "caring for our own children and extending it to the children of others" is truly admirable. Not to mention the past, just taking the recent letter to the Public Works Department, requesting the establishment of a reformatory school for juvenile offenders, their enthusiasm is enough for us ordinary people who are always worried that our children will become criminals to feel deeply grateful.</p>
<p>We don't know when the Child Welfare Association sent the letter to the Public Works Department, but we only learned about this matter recently when we saw in the newspaper that the Public Works Department's Security Committee meeting resulted in a decision to reply to the association. The result of the Public Works Department's meeting was that it was "considered difficult to implement," and the reasons were:</p>
<p>"If the association focuses on the reformation of juvenile offenders, it can contact the Public Works Department's prison authorities to discuss a cooperative plan to protect children who have been reformed after they are released from prison, etc. According to the bureau's opinion, establishing such a school would require consideration of financial aspects and does not seem necessary. Although the current juvenile reformatory is located within the prison, its site is separated from the prison by a wall, forming a completely independent unit. The teachers are all experienced personnel, sufficient to take on the responsibility. The prison authorities believe that establishing an organization to guarantee children after leaving the reformatory is more important than establishing another reformatory school..."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't know the content of the Child Welfare Association's proposal, but after reading the Public Works Department's resolution that it was "considered difficult to implement," we also feel that it makes sense. The reformation of prisoners in prison does not depend on whether they are reformed in prison, but on whether there is a guarantee after they are released. Otherwise, beautiful and moving words are not enough to eat, and titles such as "good citizen" are not enough to wear. Due to insufficient food and clothing, reformation is still equivalent to a sham. When food and clothing are sufficient, then one knows honor and disgrace. "Establishing an organization to protect children after leaving the reformatory is more important than establishing another reformatory school," this is not only for children, but also for adults.</p>
<p>How to guarantee children after leaving the reformatory? This is a question worth considering deeply. Based on what we have seen, there are homeless and thieving little urchins on the docks, and there are little beggars "pulling yellow cows" at the bridgeheads at midnight. Looking further, there are countless more. Among these, are there any who have not been to the reformatory? Of course, there are. But are there also those who have been to the reformatory, and not just once or twice? Of course, there are more. Why is this? The comment "born with a lowly bone" can only be made by big philanthropists smoking cigars and sporting big bellies, but we cannot ignore their living environment.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the living environment, we can only feel helpless. Even the Public Works Department can only say "discuss a cooperative plan to protect children who have been reformed after they are released from prison," and deeply and earnestly feel that "establishing an organization to guarantee children after leaving the reformatory is more important than establishing another reformatory school."</p>
<p>How to protect children who have been reformed after they are released from prison? We were helpless about this in the past, but in the Soviet film "Road to Life" and Pantaleev's fairy tale "Money," we found answers. These homeless children, after being reformed, not only did not become useless or wander aimlessly, but also became a vital force in building a new society. Reforming them and making them a vital force in building a new society seems not difficult, but the difficulty lies in giving these vital forces a place to use their strength. In some social organizations, perhaps it is everywhere, but in ours, there is no other way except to make them continue to commit crimes and send them back to the reformatory to be reformed again. As a result, even the Public Works Department can only hope to "discuss a cooperative plan to protect children who have been reformed after they are released from prison."</p>
<p>"Protection" is a passive approach, which is the same as all charitable undertakings. However, when will we have a better way than this "guarantee"? — Not to mention that we don't even have a "guarantee" now!</p>
<p>The Child Welfare Association's concern for children is admirable, and the Public Works Department's reasons for "considering it difficult to implement" are even more sufficient. At the same time, it also gives us an inspiration; however, this enthusiasm, this inspiration, if it is just enthusiasm and just inspiration, then it is still in vain, and it has no practical use for all the poor children who have been reformed, are being reformed, or will be reformed.</p>
<p>Can we watch children sent out of the reformatory and then sent back to the reformatory? I would like to ask all those who are concerned about children's education and all those who have siblings to pay attention.</p>
<h3>A Complete Pharmacy Building</h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>Last year, there was a major event in my country's pharmaceutical industry, which was the completion of a complete pharmacy building in Shanghai.</p>
<p>A pharmacy is an important institution in society, and everyone has to interact with it. Now that this building has been completed, it provides many conveniences to the world.</p>
<p>How complete is this pharmacy building? It is not only magnificently built, but also exquisitely equipped inside, with air conditioning for both cold and hot weather, sofas for comfortable seating, and everything is available, including household remedies, raw materials for medicines, cosmetics, medical equipment, confectionery, ……… The dispensing services are careful and attentive, the staff are attentive to customers, and the prices are cheaper than other stores. Moreover, on the fourth floor, there are special clinics for various departments, and the doctors in charge are all first-class famous doctors in Shanghai. I think everyone knows that this complete building is the Wuzhou Pharmacy on Fourth Road.</p>
<h3>Little Brother Wang's New Year</h3>
<p>— Xinxi</p>
<p>Little brother Wang is not yet one year old after this New Year, but he can actually stand firmly and walk steadily. At the same time, little brother Wu, after this New Year, is already one and a half years old, but he can't stand firmly, let alone walk steadily. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>It turns out that if an infant's bones are not strong, they cannot support the body. When little brother Wang was four months old, his parents gave him Wuzhou "Household Medicine Calcium" chocolate every day. This chocolate contains calcium and vitamin D, which are important raw materials for strengthening bones. Since the infant received this valuable ingredient supplement, his development was particularly fast, and his bones were particularly strong, not only enabling him to walk early, but also creating a foundation for his lifelong health. Little brother Wu's parents did not know to give the infant this kind of nourishing sugar, so he did not have the unexpected results like little brother Wang!</p>
<h3>Warmth in Terror</h3>
<p>— Youqi</p>
<p>——Mountain Travel Miscellany</p>
<p>Sweating profusely in the hot weather, this may surprise people, and they may suspect that it is heatstroke or some symptoms of neurasthenia. In fact, it is not like this. Our nerves are very sound, and heatstroke will not exist in young lads at all.</p>
<p>However, I don't know why, I always feel a chill in the air. This chill is definitely not something that physical strength can overcome. Looking at the lush forest, looking at the hazy mountain colors in the evening, in the distance, there is a layer of smoke covering the towering mountain peaks. The setting sun is cast into the thick smoke, reflected on the lush treetops, red, orange, changing, the sky, surrounded by the sunset, there is a piece of gorgeous glow, the color is firmly printed in the river under the bridge, beautiful nature!</p>
<p>This beautiful scenery is indeed rare in the mountainous valleys, but it does not arouse our lingering. There is a knife in the air piercing our hearts, flowing with bright red blood, and the facts give us a serious threat!</p>
<p>——Don't go there these days! The old man reiterated for the second time. Then, his eyes rolled a few times, as if he was thinking about something, maybe it was his whim? Pointing to the small road on the other side of the bridge, a good barrier was set up at the entrance of the mountain road. He said, "It has only been half a year. Tong Li three escorted forty porters through here and fell into the ambush. In an unsuspecting moment, the young master disappeared. From afar, we could still hear someone shouting. When we ran over following the sound, another person was lying down, stabbed in the leg and chest. A victorious roar came from the other side of the mountain." He stroked his beard, his eyes falling on everyone's face.</p>
<p>——What happened afterwards?</p>
<p>——That goes without saying. There were no hospitals in the mountains, and no doctors could be found. After all, it was important to hurry. That night, the wounded groaned and gradually stopped breathing!</p>
<p>Speaking of this, it seems like a section in a romance novel. The mysterious hero of the wilderness, the performance of leaving "tolls", even the mutual fighting and one side's defeat and escape, these are clearly tumbling in my head. A chill ran through my whole body. When people on this street casually look at us a few more times, we will nervously suspect that their eyes may also contain "ill intentions." Here, the uncontrollable heart is jumping, until they go far away.</p>
<p>No matter how terrible the component is, the scenery of this place is indeed too lovely. A bow-shaped street is closely connected to the stone bridge. The bridge railings are stacked into beautiful characters. The river winds and extends to the side of the mountain mouth. At the bridge, there is a small temple, which is said to enshrine the "mountain god", with a white face and black beard, and the demeanor is a bit ethereal. It is said that the mountain god's contribution to night travelers is not small. He can suppress tigers and wolves and obstruct bandits. Then, why doesn't he show his power during the day?</p>
<p>When eating, I am very grateful to the landlady for her concern, and she put more salt in the tofu flower for us who rarely have salty food. The boss is over fifty years old, while the landlady's age looks only half of that. There is a passion burning in her heart, flirting with the young lads, and her affectionate mood seems to contain infinite deep meaning. She says that we speak Miao language, and she also says that our stature and appearance are somewhat like foreigners. She does not shy away from joking with us. Although she does not possess the conditions of beauty, the charm of a young woman is always lovely. However, today, no matter how exuberant her enthusiasm is, we can say that we are deeply wary of it. I always feel that her jokes are not very natural, and other intentions may be buried in them. Therefore, the people who were stabbed at the mountain pass reappear in front of me, as if I saw a bloody body.</p>
<p>At night, how can I fall asleep? Although it is hot weather, cold sweat soaked the entire mat. Turning over, turning over, listening quietly to the water, black terror bites at my heart. Suddenly, there was a very slight footstep in the yard, strangely hurried. Looking out the window, the landlady walked in front, and the little porter followed behind, disappearing into the back courtyard of the mountain wall. So, I smiled to myself.</p>
<p>——In the night of terror, there is also an extraordinary performance of warmth!</p>
<h3>Dream</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hu</p>
<p>Kushiro Hakuson said: "I heard that when people who go to explore the South Pole are short of food, most of the things that those people dream about are delicacies from mountains and seas. I also heard that people who travel to the remote deserts of Africa dream every night of the beautiful mountains and rivers of their homeland." This statement is undoubtedly a proof that "dream" is a "symbol of suffering."</p>
<p>Usually, when our desires in life are not satisfied, we often gain satisfaction and pleasure in dreams.</p>
<p>Fantasy is the easiest thing to make us happy, but also the easiest thing to make us suffer; if the suffering of life appears in a dream, it often turns into a complex and terrifying image. I often wake up from dreams, my heart beating, and sweating all over. So I say that if fantasy reappears in a dream, it turns into reality, playing out bizarre and tragic tragedies or perfect and joyful comedies.</p>
<p>The occurrence of dreams must be related to the state of life and changes in the spirit. People who buy aviation lottery tickets often dream of winning the big prize. The desires of lovers often run into the world of consciousness during sleep, especially young people, who use all their energy to discover the mystery of the other party, but in fact, they cannot get what they want, but sometimes they get satisfaction in dreams, and naturally there are also times when they get pain.</p>
<p>Due to the instability of life, I have been dreaming frequently lately. I enter the dream world almost every night. I suspect that I have neurasthenia? It doesn't seem like it. But the blows I suffer during the day will be avenged and comforted in my dreams at night.</p>
<h3>Sand Boats</h3>
<p>— Rui Zhi</p>
<p>On the beach in front of Shapu Village, a row of sand boats rests peacefully in the morning sunlight. Although there are still a dozen or so boat tracks on the beach, after all, the sand boats that left with the early tide number only a dozen or so pairs. In the past, when the sun rose from the horizon, there wasn't a single small boat left on the beach, and the only thing the sun shone on was the long row of boat tracks left behind by the sand boats carried away by the early tide, and the village children, naked, picking up clams and shellfish abandoned by the early wind on the beach.</p>
<p>The people of Shapu Village, apart from a portion who live by fishing, the rest all depend on the sand boats that drift out to the beach in the morning and drift back in the evening.</p>
<p>When the early tide arrives, the beach is bustling with activity. The strong men of the village, one by one, flaunt their robust muscles, jump onto the empty sand boats, the old men steer with poles, and in an instant, that long row of boats, in groups of three or five, drifts out into the vast yellow sea. About two or three nautical miles from Shapu, the sand boats stop in pairs. The old men hold onto bamboo poles stuck in the water, and the young men, stripped naked, each hold bamboo baskets and sink into the water. In an instant, the bamboo baskets descend empty and rise full of yellow sand. This goes on, up and down, from morning to afternoon, and the empty sand boats are all filled with load after load of yellow sand.</p>
<p>As the sun is about to set, in front of the sand factories by the sea in Shantou, countless wooden boats filled with yellow sand gather. Sand boats from Shapu Village, Dawei Village, Magang Village, and all around have gathered in front of the sand factory, piling up the sand at a rate of thirty or sometimes forty loads per yuan onto the shore outside the sand factory. As dusk approaches, each boatload of yellow sand turns into two or three silver dollars, and the area in front of the sand factory returns to calm. The gathered sand boats also disappear into the dusky sea.</p>
<p>When the smoke of evening cooking curls from the rooftops all around Shapu Village, that long row of empty sand boats is parked in front of the beach again. The young and strong men, who have been soaked in the water all day, stretch their backs and walk off the boats, taking the few dimes they earned for the day and heading towards the village. Their lives are sustained in this way, and they spend their lives wearing themselves out for a living day after day.</p>
<p>However, recently, some iron boats with red sun flags, using machines to dredge sand, have been floating on the sea all day long. Because when manpower is compared to mechanical power, a great difference in strength is revealed. The sand boats with the sun flags are fully loaded and heading to Shantou in less than one or two hours. The sand factories no longer wait for the sand boats from Shapu Village, Dawei Village, etc. to arrive, and the shore is already piled high with mountains of yellow sand. In a small city with only a few hundred thousand citizens like this, this much sand is enough to supply the construction needs of a day. When the sand from Shapu Village and other places is transported in, it is already surplus production. Although the people at the sand factories know that the people who depend on dredging sand for a living are their own pitiful compatriots, the price of fifty or sixty loads per yuan versus thirty or forty loads per yuan forces them to only purchase from the sand boats with the sun flags. Naturally, in order to make a living, and to get a minimal price for their work, the sand boats in various places in Shapu Village have no choice but to sell at fifty or sixty loads per yuan. The reward for working all day in this way is gradually becoming unsustainable. However, the sand boats with the sun flags have increased the sand per yuan from fifty or sixty loads to seventy or eighty loads. In this way, the sand boats on the beach in front of Shapu Village have finally stopped working. Although more than ten pairs still go out to sea to work every day, sometimes they only get back the equivalent of one or two dou of rice. Although the people working on the sand boats often complain about the cold in winter and the heat in summer, feeling that it is the most bitter work in the world, now, looking at the long row of boats moored on the beach all day, they feel even more pain, because they can no longer do even that most bitter work. In their minds, perhaps they can only complain about themselves and curse at the sand boats with the sun flags still dredging on the beach. They would never think that this is precisely the suffering that the people of a country without military strength and national defense are bound to encounter! But, will the sand boats in front of Shapu Village forever rest so peacefully?</p>

<p>Good girl. When I saw you, my heart was delighted. It's a pity that the time to meet is short, and the time to part is long. Good girl. I remember you crossing mountains and seas. Eating and sleeping together. Talking and laughing in the same room. Good girl. Now you have changed your heart. Ignoring the long friendship. A bolt from the blue. How can I end it? How can I end it? How can I end it? Farewell, girl.</p>
<p>Good girl. When I saw you, I felt unusually comforted. It's a pity that you are weak-willed. Unthinkable. Good girl. You are willing to be with me. Singing of white hair forever. As long as the heavens and the earth endure. The seas run dry and the rocks crumble. Swearing never to have other thoughts. Good girl. Now you have changed your heart. Ignoring the pain you cause me. A bolt from the blue. How can I end it? How can I end it? How can I end it? Farewell, girl.</p>

<p>A fine day, a beautiful scene, a good festival is upon us. The hibiscus fills the garden, doubling the sorrow. Throughout history, beautiful women have had thin fates. Pitifully, she died after an illness. The little maid speaks of her sorrowful roots. Bao Yu's tears wet his robes. Tonight, respectfully preparing simple offerings, I send a petal of incense to the Hibiscus Goddess. Sister, if your spirit has not faded in the White Emperor Palace, do not refuse my feelings before the flower. Sister, you were born into the world at the age of sixteen. We were only together for five years. In life, your beauty was pure and flawless. The flowers and moon were ashamed of your beauty. Alas. Your innate intelligence was envied by the world. The misfortune of death came. Cherishing the bitterness of your early death, where can I find your traces in the future? And hearing that your coffin was burned, my heart aches. In this life, it is difficult to fulfill our desire to share a grave. I remember, your eyebrows were still painted with blue smoke by me. Today, the jade ring is cold to the touch. The remaining medicine in the crucible is still there. The remaining tear stains on my robe are still new. And now, who can I tell my dreams to in this lonely quilt? And I feel that the empty room has no shadows. At this moment, the moon is dark on the dewy steps, and your fragrant soul is distant. I only hear the sad cries of crickets all around. Unexpectedly, the begonias have withered and are not what they used to be. Up until now, the parrot in front of the curtain still calls your name. Your fate in the yellow earth is thin. My feelings under the gauze window are extreme. Separation in death and life was predetermined. How many beautiful women see blessings and wisdom? Let me now enter the empty gate to cultivate Zen and scatter the red dust.</p>
