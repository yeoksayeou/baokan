<h3>昨日全線劇戰敵猛烈進犯均遭痛擊</h3>
<p>寶山縣敵又開到援軍反攻　獅子林一帶雙方終日血戰　虬江碼頭敵軍已潰退江邊</p>
<p>昨日全縣均有劇烈戰事、迄今晨四時為止、敵以海陸空軍全力襲擊我軍各路陣地、企圖擊破各段包圍之勢、打通連絡綫路、我軍早有充分準備、敵終不能突破我全綫任何一點、我軍現仍佔絕對優勢、敵以數萬之衆、侷處於狹長斷網陣地中、僅憑籍其艦隊砲火之利、維持其生命、曠日持久、終必潰退、各路戰况、大要如下、㊀戰事重心、顯在吳淞寶山獅子林方面、敵艦集結口外、一畫夜間大砲向我軍陣地轟繫不停、蘊澡浜之敵向吳淞增援、拂曉卽枸我反攻、血戰至深晚未停、㊁實山城內我守軍一營、已與城外我生力軍部隊取得運絡、敵援軍開到、再度猛烈進犯、我內外夾擊、敵傷亡奇重．今農尚在肉搏血戰中，㊁我生力部隊開抵獅子林、猛攻該方面登陸之敵、血戰竟日、敵軍陣地、已有動搖模樣、㊃被陷於重圍中之羅店殘敵，屢次向我軍陣地猛衝、均不得邊㊄虬江碼頭登陸之敵經我軍三面壓迫、已退集江邊、無能活動、㊅浦江敵艦、時向我江灣閘北陣地炮轟、敵亦不時以小部隊前來騷擾、策應吳淞實山方面敵軍進犯、我防務鞏固兀不為動、</p>
<p>中央社八日晨一時報告、軍息、㊀六日以來張華浜之敵、越過南市塘河向我猛攻、我軍稍從退、下午我增援反攻敵退出數村莊、現仍對峙中、㊁虬江碼頭我軍陣地、六日夜被敵猛攻數次、我碼頭守軍一連全部殉雞、致被敵槃據我軍七日猛烈反攻、已迫近至虬江碼頭不遠之十字路口、</p>
<h3>我增援部隊到達猛攻獅子林敵軍</h3>
<p>全日激戰敵已不支</p>
<p>獅子林江面之敵艦、前日以密集之炮火、整日向我獅子林陣地轟擊〝掩腰敵軍登陸、我軍亦以密集之機擒掃射、抗阻敵軍登岸、激戰終日、卒以敵方砲火之密集、援軍無法前進、致有一部份敵軍強渡登陸、至昨日我軍得到後方部隊之增援猛力向敵進攻、激戰至昨日晚間、敵軍以傷亡重大、且又孤立無援、已呈不支之勢矣、</p>
<h3>敵又增援攻寶山被我軍內外夾擊</h3>
<p>血戰竟日敵腹背受困</p>
<p>敵由實山潰退後、昨晨又由後方開到大批援軍、向實山城內外我軍陣地猛號．我軍沉着應戰、迎頭痛擊、敵憑藉飛機大砲之掩讀、雖死傷野、仍排死不退、血戰竟日、迄深晚雙方猶在肉搏混戰中、中央社、孤軍苦戰死守實山城之我軍士兵一營、昨仍安然無恙、敵軍昨由寶山城外東北角向我猛衛、當經我到撤城外廠援之部隊包圍、與城內之我軍內外夾擊、敵軍腹背受困狠狽不堪、</p>
<h3>吳淞鎮敵我昨激戰</h3>
<p>中央社、昨日拂曉之前、蕰藻派方面、有敵軍四五百人渡浜、至吳淞鎮增援、猛力向我反攻、停泊江面之敵艦、亦同時向我砲擊、我軍奮勇應戰、並以畫砲還擊、迄晚猶在激戰之中、昨日敵軍自寶山失敗後、殘兵均退集於東門外、窮促海隅、再無發展之可能、淞賣路上之上海蓄植公司、卽所謂敵司令部者、昨已高竪我中華旗幟、獅予橋有敵軍一部份、亦被我逼退入南石塘砲台廢基中、潛伏不敢出戰、同濟路方面、我軍已抄越三官堂興敵對峙於泰興路、且興西翼我軍銜接、取得直綫、對於沖陣包圍、兩感便利、故昨日觀察吳淞各綫敵軍、似均取守勢、或作別有企圖、第我前方陣綫、嚴如鐵壁、任敵詭詐、終難得逞也、</p>
<h3>張華浜敵倫渡不成</h3>
<p>淞南張華浜之殘敵三四百入、利用撈得楊樹𣹷樣泰木行漂失之楊松木料等、在南首前海軍醫院及陳家宅外灘、搭成盬時碼頭兩座、藉便增援敵軍之登陸、昨晨天未黎明時、有一部份援軍、約數百人偷渡登岸、擬聯絡張華浜之殘敵、向南進攻、以圍與楊樹浦敵軍聯慣一氣、當經我駐守該處防軍、沉着應戰、激戰約戰十分鐘．嘆常劇烈、敵軍因飛機大砲、均失其效用、發受刻甚重、企圖登岸南攻之計、又不得逞、狼狽退回敵艦、</p>
<h3>虬江碼頭敵已擊退</h3>
<p>據官方確息、自前日虬江碼頭敵援軍登陸後、卽在沿軍工路一帶各要隘、構築防劍工事、我軍乘其立脚未穩、下先發制人之計遂於昨晨天尚未明、全棧反攻、敵倉皇應戰、陣綫凌亂、我則奮勇百倍、衝殺猛進、予敵以重大損偽、迄晚砲火稍息、敵已潰退至浦濱、頗有戲斷其運續之可能、殱滅殘敵、會黨不遠、</p>
<h3>引翔港敵傷亡慘重</h3>
<p>楊樹浦一帶敵軍、自日前（五日）得正規陸軍之接防增緩、又圖蠢動、昨日拂曉、浦中敵艦多艘、泊於縷家嘴附近、頻以大砲向引翔港跑鳥殤一帶我軍陣地轟擊、掩護該方面敵軍淮榎、我軍沉着以待、俟敵軍迫近、約百米達之處、卽以迫聲砲機闕槍等密集射聲、激戰甚烈、迄傍晚時分、仍不得逞、敵乃全部潰退、遺屍滿地、想見其傷亡之慘重、</p>
<h3>閘北猛烈砲戰敵軍終被我擊敗</h3>
<p>雙方鏖戰至今晨始止</p>
<p>昨晨拂曉、虹口天通庵之敵、頻頻向我閘北陣地進犯、我守軍沈着應付、敵屢圖衝出、俱犧牲於我密集之機槍及手溜彈之下、不支而退、昨日下午、該處敵軍、又向我閘北守軍進犯、共美路一帶、亦採同一行動、以謀牽制我軍、策應楊樹浦方面之敵、雙方之前哨苦鬥、又行開始、機槍掃射、密如連珠、相持不下、至昨日下午六時、浦江敵艦以重砲向閘北我軍猛轟、希圈破壞我後方、策應其進犯之敵、我軍亦以重砲還擊、瞄準敵海軍司令部直射、一時隆隆之聲、震動遐邇、八時緩、砲聲漸稀、然仍斷斷續續、在互相猛轟之中、砲轟之外、雜有密集之機槍聲、午夜十二時後、砲聲又密、雙方廖戰、異常激烈、至今晨三時、衢出之敵、卒被我軍擊敗、向原地潰退、</p>
<p>中央社、昨日拂曉之前、敵海軍陸隊、由天通庵向我閘化方面進攻、栽軍沈着應戰、俟敵逼近、卽以機關枪密集掃射、同時並以手溜彈向敵襲擊、敵軍傷亡甚鉅、不支而退、</p>
<p>中央社、昨日傍晚敵軍砲擊我閘北、我亦以重砲還擊、互矗約二小時始止、旋於晚間十時許、敵軍父閒砲向我閘北面轟擊、我方除以重砲還擊外、同時並以追擊砲向虹口方而敵軍陣地轟擊、斷續之砲擊、直至今晨一時許尚未休止、</p>
<h3>敵又企圖浦東登陸</h3>
<p>敵軍四十餘人、於昨晨十時、分乘小挺兩艘、游弋浦東春江嗎頭浦面、企圖偷渡登岸、同時停泊三菱碼頭江心之敵十六號驅逐艦、頻向浦東開砲轟聲、</p>
<p>中央社、昨日上午九時四十分、停泊於三菱碼頭之敵十六號驅逐艦、突向我浦東陸家嘴方面開砲轟擊、旋卽停止、同時有小艇兩艘、裝載敵便衣隊五十餘人、游弋於春江碼頭浦面、似係企圖登陸云、</p>
<h3>出雲旗艦指揮作戰</h3>
<p>中央社、敵司令艦出雲號、昨夜又悄然駛離公和祥碼頭對面之二號浮筒、泊駐吳淞口外指揮集結該處大小敵艦九十二艘作戰、截至昨日午刻、始行駛回、</p>
<h3>我燬敵艦三艘之多</h3>
<p>據軍事機關確報、我空軍一大隊、前晚七時許、在小川沙洋面、向敵軍艦隊大施轟炸、結果被我投中轟燬軀逐艦二艘、巡洋艦一艘、戲項戰續、業經我南京方面體實、</p>
<p>中央社云、前晚七時許、我空軍一隊、飛往小川沙口轟炸敵艦、當時有敵艦兩艘、着彈焚燬，擴官方消息、此焚燬之兩艦係屬驅逐艦、此外尚有敵巡洋體一艘、亦被我機炸傷、受損甚鉅、</p>
<p>中央社南京六日路透電、此間某高級軍事機關今夜十時接上海前方電話日、我軍飛機猛轟淞口外之敵艦、以重炸彈擊中敵軀逐艦兩艘、輿巡洋艦一艘、</p>
<h3>駛滬敵艦共百州餘</h3>
<p>駛灣敵機之總數、刻已還一百三十艘以上、據記者今日赴淞口調查所得、敵艦大部現仍集結昊淞一带、計凡九十二艘、劉河及小川沙一帶江面、則有二十餘艘、至於浦江所泊則槿剩十三艘　茲將吳淞一帶之敵艦九十二艘　分泊情形調查如下、計淞口三峽水外、敵第一艦隊軍艦十艘　三峽水江面運輸航空母艦一艘、（可載飛機六十架）巡洋艦Yubari號一艘、另散泊該慮江面大小敵艦十五艘、吳淞口敵艦八艘、自三峽水外至吳淞口敵運輸艦二十五艘、蕰藻浜巡洋艦　Kiao號一艘、一號驅逐艦二艘、大小運輸艦五艘張華浜第十七號驅逐艦二艘、六號砲艦三艘、巡洋艦Yura號一艘高橋驅逐艦三嫂、東溝魚市場大小艦五艘、總計自三峽水至東溝．共泊有敵艦九十二艘之多云、</p>

<h3>敵機三度炸北新涇</h3>
<p>字林西報斥為太無意識</p>
<p>滬西北新涇、敵機昨作第三度之轟炸、上午十時許、又有敵機二架、由東北飛來、先在羅別根路庇亞土路𨍭角、白𣜊杆地方、投一巨彈、落空地上、並無損失、織在鎭口小菜塲投二彈、係一老嫗、及其所挈小孩、又在鎮東半里許小全家宅附近趙和卿宅前投二彈、宅後投二彈、均落曠地、亦未受損、該鎭紳沈紹裯住宅於前日炸燬、西市某大洋貨號、亦全部炸毀、房屋全毀者五六十間、破壞及損失、為數甚多、當地居民、於被刦後逃避一空、景象凄涼、地方警團、正在竭力警戒維護中、</p>
<p>又訊、昨日上午敵機二架、飛往北新鎮上空環繞匝、當在鎭北投下巨彈二顆、鎭南擲下二顆、均爆發、在一號橋壁利南路蘇洲河沿炸沉滿裝茹之地貸船一只、船主黃金根州傷、共妻當場斃命、其母亦重傷、尚有鄉民朱大丫頭一名、偽及足部、均由紅十字會第七救護隊救護車救回隊部醫治、</p>
<p>（中央社）敵機三架、於昨晨十時左右、在北新涇一帶投彈轟炸、其中一彈落於庇亞士路附近爆炸、死平崁八入、傷二人、其他無甚損失、</p>
<p>字林西報昨載短評云、假使日飛機轟炸行動、而使極司非而區遭受慘禍者有軍事目的、則當言其所獲結果、實與其意志完全抵觸、此次聶炸、復使不幸之難民死傷彙彙而其天空發威之舉動、則毫無利益可言、日飛機之轟炸該區也、或將使上海食品供給機關受有嚴重影饗、蓋此舉除毀及蔬圃外、更將引起恐慌、而使菜傭不敢担菜入市、職是之故、及因其他事故、誠不能日飛機矗炸之動機、何以不作相當之豫謀、而限定其軍事目標、最近英闕為許閣森爵士受傷案致日本之牒文、會約略說明飛行家關於此節之責任、乃日本報紙登載此文、竟加以刪削、僅錄英國所願有之補救計畫、而將平心靜氣剴切耬述之可貴原則一筆勾去、此殊可太息者也、</p>
<h3>敵機昨又四出投彈</h3>
<p>中央社云、昨日午後、敵機父大隊出動、先是有機四架，先後各二、經第一特區上空往北而去、在引翔鄉市中心區一帶盤旋偵察、並在跑馬場附近投彈十餘枚、約一刻鐘許、又有兩機追綜而去、會齊後組成一小隊、另一機在旁向東而飛、在楊樹浦底來回偵察、其時有疏落之砲聲、在鬧市中隱約可聞、同時浦東方面、另有十三機、在海口高橋一帶成環形盤和、旋有一機、則在賴義渡上空低飛偵察、頻以機槍向街上行人掃射、格格之聲、隔浦可聞云、浦東路及瑞鎔船廠碼頭附近、均遭轟炸、至約二時、各機結集大隊、向西南而去、進擾滬杭路沿綫</p>
<p>中央社云、昨晨七時許、敵機十錄架、在滬市天空盤旋連二小時許、先在滬南一帶、結成一大隊窺察甚久、族分成若干小隊、在閘兆浦東灑西等處投彈轟炸、閘化一區投彈尤多、並用機愴掃射、我駐軍以高射砲及高射機關槍射擊、敵機始行逸去、</p>
<h3>敵軍遭受重創事實</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨晨（六日浦灘有入見受傷之日陸兵與水兵四五百人、自泊於日總領車署下之運艦興軍艦用擔架舁至岸上、此足證明日海軍在吳淞登陸時遭遇華軍之强烈抵抗、如運艦興驅逐艦須運下如是巨數之傷兵、則料已往一二中受傷之實數、當必多於此數二三倍、且日本醫院船泊其艦隊中、已有半月之久、今此項偽兵須運至岸聲治、則醫院船與另一安置傷兵之較火軍艦所收傷兵之多、可以想見矣、至於陸兵興水兵登岸時溺斃者共有幾何、未能佔計、恐其數亦必不少也、</p>
<h3>敵浪費軍火之可笑</h3>
<p>大陸報云、某外人曾在江濱閒眺、謂扛濱伏有華兵一名、曾向日砲艦或驅逐艦偶爾關愴、共所費槍彈、約值七角左右、日艦同砲所值、則達七十元左右、日艦每遇華兵開槍時、輒向開檢方面發一吋口徑之砲彈數枚、於是該華兵乃停止開槍、但一小時後、又開檜一二響、日艦乃又發砲彈數枚、此發彼止、此止彼發、彼發冷槍之華兵、似安伏無傷、而日艦則大為忙碌矣、此種行動、大類捉迷藏戲、殊堪發噱、按吋口徑之砲彈、每枚約值美金十元、華人每次發槍一二饗、日輒報以砲彈四五枚、</p>
<h3>西人捐金慰我防軍</h3>
<p>日前有西人H.Notreh者投函大陸報日、中國防軍在上海附近忠勇衛國、吾人深加欽佩、吾入客居中國、對於中國所抱之主義、當予同情　同時並當自願助資與此輩防軍、藉以表示敬慕其勇敢之微忱、鄙人茲首先捐助五十元、以為之倡、深望其他許多外僑齊起嚮應、輔助此有價值之舉、</p>
<h3>美英法共同節略我當局正式答復</h3>
<p>因日軍企圖在油東登陸　故其責任完全屬諸日方　應使日艦退出浦江</p>

<h3>汪主席講救國公債（續）</h3>
<p>所以說現代的戰爭、不只是兵力作戰、而是財力作戰、我們明白了能持久、然後能勝利則我們不可不下十二分的決心、用十二分的努力、來講求如何的纔能持久、昨日的報紙、各位同胞都看見了、日本臨時議會　於本月四日舉行開會式、所謂中國事變臨時軍費特別會計　千二百餘萬元、一般會計追加預算四千二百餘萬元、這種臨時軍事費的來源、大部分是發行公債、本年度頂算仲額　因此共達五十四萬七千一百餘萬元、本年度發行公償　當在三十三四萬萬元、日俄戰投、全部戰費修僅十五萬零八百四十七萬元、此次中日事變前後兩次軍事費共達二十五萬萬兀、這種數目、比起我們所謂發行教國公債五萬萬元·真是渺乎其小、怪不得侵略主義者誇卜大口、說要在較短期間之內屈服我們了、然而我們敢肯定的說在最短期閒之內、決不會看見我們的屈服、只會看見敵人的崩潰、伺以呢敵人的軍費、是以之充優略之用的、軍費的負担、不外喪之於少數的資本家、和冬數的平民、這些資本家和平民、被侵略主義者逼迫著　有好好的和平日子不過、卻要榨出血汁來、從專戰爭、心襄的不快活、可想而知、而且這種戰爭、是沒有底止的、中國焦頸爛額的時侯、是日本筋疲力盡的時侯、到這時侯、無異是對於各國露了破綻、予以可乘、日本每一個資本家、每一個平民、打算到此都不能不寒心、都不能不對於優略主義者、加以痛很、侵略主義　壓榨得越利害則痛恨得越利害、其為崩潰、蓋必然之事、至於我們所出的軍費　為的是抵抗侵略、為的是捐免了做亡國奴、當教們在身上榨出血汗的時侯、誠然是痛苦的、然而忍受這些痛苦而捐免了做亡國奴的痛苦、那就很值得了、所以我們的負擔、是出於自愿的　只要政府將這些血汗一點一滴的都用於抗戰、只要將士將這些而汙　點一滴的在抗戰時侯發揮得書致、人民必然將所有血汗都拿出來、如此說來、敵人方面越侵略越崩潰、我們方面越抵抗越團結、在軍費的數目字上敵人雖比我們為多、而在負擔軍費的心理上、我們卻比敵人更為堅決、更為熱烈、還有一層、我們現在固然還是農業國固然還楚不能完全脫離了　手工業的經濟狀況、固然還沒有完全進於現代工業的經濟狀況、（未完）</p>

<h3>敵進犯市中心區我軍血肉相搏殺敵如麻</h3>
<p>敵狼狽潰退江邊遺屍盈野　羅店昨日有激戰傷亡慘重　寶山守軍抱城亡與亡决心</p>
<p>自六日起、戰事重心、由羅店而轉向寶山、一時敵集中海陸空軍、向寶山我軍陣地猛攻、查寶山縣城、地處江濱原非軍事要塞、第以敵軍作戰計劃、初以全力進取羅店、以為全局戰爭之根據地、今羅店旣不順手、乃改由吳淞蕰藻浜張華浜方面、向楊行進攻、再取劉行、企圖打通至羅店之綫而此計又不得逞、再次乃於六日起沿江向寶山挺進、希圖佔領寶山孤城、作為後方根據、進窺月浦楊行、分向羅店猛攻、今則寶山旣未陷落、前進部隊、又被我精銳援軍、節節逼迫、死傷甚巨、其預定計劃、又大受打擊、今我軍已迫近城廂、距敵軍甚近、裹外呼應、敵雖二度增援、决難得逞、羅店方面雙方激戰甚久、肉搏衝鋒空前未有、結果、敵軍死傷甚衆、我軍佔極大優勢、前鋒東接月浦、與敵軍沿田家巷顧涇塘而對岐、左翼則與敵軍沿界境河長橋等處作戰並續有進佔、已完畢大包圍之步驟、該處敵軍、雖仍可與川沙口之艦艇保得聯絡、但絕難發展、至於吳淞口以迄蕰藻浜張華浜之敵、可謀與楊樹浦間取得聯絡、昨曾極全力由虬江碼頭向前挺進、企圖襲我引翔鄉江灣市中心、當被我大隊援軍趕上、三面夾擊、敵卒不支潰退現在五權路軍工路之間相互對峙中、閘北江灣路之敵軍、日來雖不時擾動、表面似係反攻、實則乃為東區敵軍之聲援、决無突破我軍陣地之可能、且自張華浜以迄砲台灣之間、被我切成兩斷、綜觀昨日日夜、各路戰事均極激烈、敵軍力謀各路打成一片、我則誓必予以分頭擊破、並殲滅其實力、預料主力戰爭、當不遠矣、</p>
<h3>虬江碼頭敵犯市區被我三面反攻擊退</h3>
<p>現相持於五權路軍工路間　　敵因腹背受攻致傷亡慘重</p>
<p>虬江碼頭方面、敵軍登陸後、進展甚速、一度將近市中心區、迨我軍南西北三面大隊援軍、同時反攻後、敵軍前進部、立卽狠狽潰退、現在五權路與軍工路之間相持中、又據另一報告、昨晚今晨、敵機及大砲、由虬江碼頭方面、向我軍陣地進攻、希圖掩護其步兵前進、我軍猛力夾擊反攻、敵軍傷亡甚鉅、現我軍固守□□□及市中心區東首各村莊、敵無再進之力、</p>
<p>中央社云、虬江碼頭方面之敵、於六强渡登陸、昨經我軍整日猛烈之進攻、將敵軍壓迫退至軍工路一帶、不意敵方大批援軍、於昨晚登陸增援、在敵艦砲火掩護之下、以裝甲車為前導、猛烈向我反攻、而以市中心區為目的地、我軍以密集之機關槍掃射、同時並以手溜彈向敵襲擊、激戰至晚間十一時許、卒以敵方砲火之猛烈、及裝甲車之橫行、我軍壯烈犧牲之後、逐被敵軍左翼衝到王家宅、右翼進入五權路、旋於今晨拂曉之前、我軍後方部隊、亦到達增援、併力向敵方猛衝、壯烈之肉搏戰於焉開始、我軍盡上刺刀向敵衝刺、問以手溜彈向敵襲擊、一切火器、至是均告無用、僅憑血肉之軀相搏、敵軍處此無法應付、陣綫大亂、我忠勇之士兵縱橫敵陣、殺敵如麻、敵軍倉皇棄械而逃遺屍充塞於途我軍雖白刃盡赤、然仍鼓餘勇，柔勝追擊、至今日上午八時許、我軍已進達軍工路、敵軍退處江邊、狼狽不堪、楊樹浦方面之敵、昨晚亦同時向我引翔鄉方面進攻、期與虬江碼頭方面之敵、將夾擊之效、當經我軍奮勇擊退、敵末得逞、今晨六時許、曾有敵機九架、在引翔鄉跑馬場一帶轟炸、歷兩小時始去、旋於上午八時及十二時許、停泊於陸家嘴以北浦面之敵艦兩艘、開砲向我引翔鄉方面轟擊、惟我軍並無損害、</p>
<p>又據軍界消息、敵軍亟謀打通自楊樹浦至張華浜蕰藻浜間之聯絡、不得已挺而走險、派大批陸軍由虬江碼頭登陸、冀截我中路、六日自晨起、敵軍達五六千人之眾、由軍艦砲火與飛護之下、向引翔鄉江灣一帶猛力進撲、一時聲勢浩大、當被我援軍趕到、三面夾攻、敵軍不支、退歸虬江碼頭一帶、昨晨敵又增援反攻、停泊江中之兵艦、與火隊飛機、密集砲火、猛力進攻、終日砲火不停、曾一度已逼近市中心、我方大批援軍、火速趕上、後方砲兵、亦集中攻擊、三面包抄、攔腰襲擊、槍砲之聲、密如爆竹、我軍奮勇當先、一往直前、敵軍不支潰退、傷亡遍野、損失奇重、至昨晚九時許、敵軍仍退回虬江碼頭、盤據於附近之房屋內、我軍仍進至軍工路一帶、嚴密防禦中、</p>
<h3>我寶山守軍與敵軍拼死血戰</h3>
<p>我援軍已迫近城廂　將與城內駐兵夾擊</p>

<p>據軍事機關接得前方報告　寶山附近之敵兵、自經我軍某部精銳、迎頭痛擊後、傷亡奇重、被迫後退、昨又續增援軍、再圖返攻、寶山城內我守兵一營、始終死守孤城、敵人雖屢以飛機大砲猛烈聶擊、决不稍懈、誓抱城存與存、城亡與亡之决心、而城外某部生力軍、在城東南面、已迫近城廂、與敵人相距不遠、與城內駐兵、裹應外合、敵人决難得逞、</p>

<h3>吳淞寶山敵軍切斷</h3>
<p>張華浜殘敵被我包圍　南北兩綫亦同樣切截</p>
<p>確息、張華浜蕰藻浜吳淞鎮以及砲台灣沿江一帶敵軍、其總數不下五千餘名、自遭我軍痛擊後、傷亡幾及其半、但因敵援陸續有增、故敵仍負嵎頑抗、前日寶山之敵、卽藉其後援、由吳淞間道而來、無奈我軍早有準備、卽予迎頭痛擊、敵乃不支、向吳淞原路潰退、我軍乘勝追擊、直至今晨、得悉在吳淞鎮砲台灣間之敵、已被我軍包圍、四面兜擊、所有敵之吳淞寶山間聯絡綫、已被我切斷、同時張華浜蕰藻浜沿江敵軍殘部、亦已於今晨拂曉前被我取得包圍形勢、將敵軍南北二面聯絡綫（北通吳淞南通滬江大學）同樣切斷、並繼續推進追擊中、</p>
<h3>吳淞方面砲戰劇烈</h3>
<p>我軍砲隊亦予還擊</p>
<p>吳淞方面之敵軍、係第十一師團之天谷旅團、昨晚敵曾對我曹家宅·董家寺·金家宅·潘家宅·等處陣地撲擊、落敵艦砲彈三百餘枚、但我方並無重大損傷、又敵艦多艘在月浦洋面、昨晚亦向我東面陣地亂轟、東溝敵艦、同時亦開砲助戰、我□□方面□□□地帶之炮隊、亦向吳淞獅子林一帶敵軍陣地還攻、故昨晚及今晨之問、大砲之聲、聯續未斷、</p>
<h3>張華浜敵痛擊潰退</h3>
<p>我浴血前進激戰甚久　現仍保持南池塘陣地</p>
<p>張華浜敵軍、昨晚利用飛機及軍艦大砲、向我攻擊甚力、企圖掩護大隊步兵、向我軍反攻、常時激戰甚烈、敵軍曾一度越過南池塘、同時敵軍又派另一部隊、在堰頭石附近、分兩路渡河、我前綫部隊、分頭痛擊、阻共前進外、復由後增調大隊援軍、會同原有軍力、大舉反攻、沿血前進、激戰數小時、敵始不支潰退、我軍仍保持南池塘陳地、</p>

<p>楊樹浦方面各守原綫　瀏河敵擊退後無動靜</p>
<p>閘北敵軍、屢次擾動、我方已洞悉其詭計、置之不理、彼以為可以乘機進攻時、我軍則俟其過近、突出痛擊、敵軍猝不及防、屢遭大挫、昨夜數軍又施故技、終未得逞、復受損失耳、此外如楊樹浦方面、各守原綫、並無變化、濟河登陸敵軍被擊退後、昨今均無動靜、羅店方面、我軍仍在嚴密包圍中、</p>

<p>［馬尼剌］當菲律賓群島正在達到完全獨立目的之進程中、日海軍在華南海上大事活動、已令此間人士惶惶不安、尤其因香港傳來日海軍已佔據東沙島消息之故、菲島美人所辦唯一報紙‘馬尼剌日報’載稱、日本之行動已炸毀關於菲律賓之數種理想、其一為菲律賓置有相當少數之防軍、即能使國家臻於安全是、再日軍在華南之侵略、將前屢若何之遠、今無人敢加豫料云、又半官性賓之菲律賓導報調、日軍之佔據東沙島、己使菲律賓在半途為日本所有之土地包圍矣、又稱　菲島之防衛計劃不得在地理上受人損害云、（中央社八日路透電）</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>中日兩國。並未正式宣戰。而日方突將我國海岸綫。完全封鎖。此種非法蠻橫舉動。實開國際間未有之惡例。</p>
<p>日本對鎖我國海岸綫之目的。無非欲斷絕鄰國對我軍火上之供給。其賓此種策略。早為我國所預料。故並不希望任何鄰國之接濟。我之武器便是‘抗敵精神。’‘勇敢善戰的戰士。’與‘團結一致的熱忱’决不恃機械化之武器以較勝負也。</p>
<p>但各國商輪。被日方非法檢查。而不予痛懲。則此種容忍態度。未免出於水平綫下矣。上海為國際市塲。我國本為入超之國·假定封鎖之後。而外國商輪。絕跡不至。則我國將自給自足。不致入超。則我方且感謝日人之不遑矣。</p>

<p>首以日本軍力言、共具有眞正戰鬥力之正規軍、僅十七個師團、其他退役之在鄕軍人雖號稱百萬之衆、但一旦實際動員、欲其效命疆場、則結果必感失望、蓋所謂在鄕軍人者、不獨人人均有妻室之累、且完全均係資產商人、養奪處優、已非朝夕、今乃一旦軀使若輩作拋妻別子、生還無望、侵略他國之載爭、而欲求其一舉戰勝睡獅早醒之中國、非獨勢不可能、且恐力有未逮、今滬戰方開始二十餘日、陸軍兵力日軍已不斷增至五師團矣、連同海軍陸戰隊之人數、已將逾代表矣、艦隊集中滬濱一隅、已達百艘以上矣、然其所獲之代價、卽久限沿海滬東一隅之苦戰、鉅量軍火物質之消耗、與夫大批陣亡官乓屍身骨灰之運回、以及激起世界各國之反感、及遭逢嚴應之縫費而巳、而最足引世界人士驚異者、即中國官兵人人均抱定為國犧牲之决心、一見敵至、輒血肉相搏、此種偉大之精神、卽求諸歐戰時之戰跡中、亦所罕覯故日本若以今日之中國、仍以為甲甲午時代之中國、固屬神勺計矢常、卽以、二八時期相較日本偽亦飛昔吳吧之甚矣、總之、日本難欲背誠城借、其奈中國抱破釜沉舟之志何</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Fierce Battles Along the Entire Front, Enemy's Intense Attacks Met with Forceful Counterattacks</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops in Baoshan County Receive Reinforcements and Counterattack; All-Day Bloody Battle in the Area of Shizilin; Enemy Troops at Qiujiang Wharf in Full Retreat Towards the Riverbank</p>
<p>Fierce battles occurred throughout the entire county yesterday. Until 4 a.m. this morning, the enemy launched a full-scale attack on our army's various positions using naval, land, and air forces, attempting to break through the encirclement and open up communication lines. Our army was well-prepared, and the enemy ultimately failed to breach any point along our entire line. Our army still maintains absolute superiority. The enemy, with tens of thousands of troops, is confined to a narrow, cut-off area, relying solely on the advantage of their naval artillery to sustain their existence. With the passage of time, they will inevitably collapse. The general situation on various fronts is as follows: ㊀ The focus of the battle is clearly in the Wusong, Baoshan, and Shizilin areas. Enemy ships are gathered outside the port, with heavy artillery incessantly bombarding our army's positions day and night. The enemy at Yunzaobang reinforced Wusong and launched a counterattack at dawn, with bloody fighting continuing until late at night. ㊁ Inside Shishan City, one battalion of our defending troops has established communication with our fresh troops outside the city. Enemy reinforcements arrived and launched another fierce attack. We attacked from both inside and outside, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The battle is still ongoing in close quarters. ㊁ Our fresh troops arrived at Shizilin and launched a fierce attack on the enemy troops who had landed in that area. After a day of bloody fighting, the enemy's position showed signs of wavering. ㊃ The remaining enemy troops trapped in the heavy encirclement at Luodian repeatedly charged our army's positions but were unable to approach. ㊄ The enemy troops who landed at Qiujiang Wharf, under the pressure of our army's three-sided attack, have retreated and gathered at the riverbank, unable to move. ㊅ Enemy ships in the Huangpu River occasionally shelled our Jiangwan and Zhabei positions. The enemy also frequently sent small units to harass us, coordinating with the enemy's attack in the Wusong and Shishan areas. Our defenses are solid and unmoved.</p>
<p>Central News Agency report at 1 a.m. on the 8th: Military news: ㊀ Since the 6th, the enemy at Zhanghuabang has crossed the Nanshi Tanghe River and launched a fierce attack on us. Our army retreated slightly, but in the afternoon our reinforcements counterattacked and the enemy withdrew from several villages. The situation is currently at a stalemate. ㊁ Our army's position at Qiujiang Wharf was fiercely attacked by the enemy several times on the night of the 6th. One company of our wharf defenders was entirely martyred, allowing the enemy to occupy the position. Our army launched a fierce counterattack on the 7th and has pushed close to the crossroads not far from Qiujiang Wharf.</p>
<h3>Our Reinforcements Arrive and Fiercely Attack Enemy Troops at Shizilin</h3>
<p>Intense Battles Throughout the Day, Enemy Near Collapse</p>
<p>The enemy ships on the river surface off Shizilin bombarded our Shizilin positions with concentrated artillery fire throughout the previous day, covering the enemy's landing. Our army also used concentrated machine gun fire to sweep and resist the enemy's landing. After a day of intense fighting, the enemy's concentrated artillery fire prevented our reinforcements from advancing, allowing a portion of the enemy troops to forcibly land. Yesterday, our army received reinforcements from the rear and launched a fierce attack on the enemy. The fighting continued until yesterday evening, with the enemy suffering heavy casualties and being isolated without support, showing signs of collapse.</p>
<h3>Enemy Reinforcements Attack Baoshan Again, Met with Our Army's Pincer Attack</h3>
<p>Bloody Battle Throughout the Day, Enemy Beset on All Sides</p>
<p>After the enemy's retreat from Shishan, a large number of reinforcements arrived from the rear yesterday morning and fiercely attacked our army's positions inside and outside Shishan City. Our army calmly responded and dealt them a head-on blow. The enemy, relying on the cover of airplanes and artillery, continued to charge despite heavy casualties. A bloody battle raged throughout the day, with both sides still engaged in close combat late into the night. Central News Agency: One battalion of our soldiers, fighting a lonely battle and desperately defending Shishan City, was still safe and sound yesterday. Yesterday, the enemy launched a fierce attack on us from the northeast corner outside Baoshan City, which was surrounded by our troops stationed outside the city and attacked from both inside and outside with our troops inside the city. The enemy was beset on all sides and in a terrible state.</p>
<h3>Intense Fighting Between Enemy and Our Forces at Wusong Town Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Before dawn yesterday, 400-500 enemy troops crossed the Yunzaobang River to reinforce Wusong Town and launched a fierce counterattack on us. Enemy ships anchored on the river surface also shelled us simultaneously. Our army fought bravely and returned fire with heavy artillery. The fighting continued until evening. Yesterday, after the enemy's defeat at Baoshan, the remnants gathered outside the East Gate, confined to the coast, with no possibility of further development. The Shanghai Plantation Company on Songhu Road, the so-called enemy headquarters, had already raised our Chinese flag yesterday. A portion of the enemy troops at Shizi Bridge were also forced by us to retreat into the ruins of the Nanshantang battery, lying in wait and daring not to fight. On the Tongji Road front, our army has bypassed the Sanguantang and confronted the enemy at Taixing Road, and has connected with our troops on the west flank, achieving a straight line. This makes it more convenient for us to launch an assault and encircle the enemy. Therefore, observing the enemy forces on all fronts at Wusong yesterday, it seemed that they were all adopting a defensive posture, or planning some other scheme. However, our front line is as solid as a wall of iron, and no matter how cunning the enemy is, they will ultimately fail.</p>
<h3>Enemy Fails to Land at Zhanghuabang</h3>
<p>The remaining 300-400 enemy troops at Zhanghuabang in Songnan used the Yangsong timber lost by the Yangshu Wharf Taifeng Timber Company to build two temporary wharves outside the former Naval Hospital and Chenjiazhai Bund in the south, in order to facilitate the landing of enemy reinforcements. Yesterday morning, before dawn, a portion of the reinforcements, about several hundred people, secretly crossed and landed, intending to connect with the remaining enemy troops at Zhanghuabang and attack south, in order to link up with the enemy troops in Yangshupu. Our defending troops stationed there calmly responded and fought fiercely for about ten minutes. The fighting was very intense. The enemy's airplanes and artillery were ineffective, and they suffered heavy casualties. Their plan to land and attack south was foiled again, and they retreated in a panic back to enemy ships.</p>
<h3>Enemy Driven Back from Qiujiang Wharf</h3>
<p>According to official sources, since the enemy reinforcements landed at Qiujiang Wharf the day before, they had been building defensive fortifications along the Yijungong Road and other strategic points. Our army, taking advantage of their unstable foothold, launched a preemptive counterattack early yesterday morning. The enemy responded in a hurry, and their lines were in disarray. We, on the other hand, fought with a hundredfold courage and charged fiercely, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. By nightfall, the artillery fire had subsided slightly, and the enemy had retreated to the Pujiang Bund, making it possible to cut off their supply line. The extermination of the remaining enemy troops is not far off.</p>
<h3>Enemy Suffers Heavy Casualties at Yinxiang Port</h3>
<p>Since the enemy forces in the Yangshupu area received regular army reinforcements a few days ago (the 5th), they have attempted to cause trouble again. At dawn yesterday, several enemy ships in the Huangpu River were anchored near Lujiazui, frequently firing artillery at our army's positions in the Yinxiang Port area, covering the enemy's advance in that area. Our army calmly waited until the enemy troops approached, to about 100 meters away, and then fired concentrated artillery, machine gun, and rifle fire, resulting in fierce fighting. Until late in the afternoon, the enemy was still unable to advance and retreated completely, leaving corpses everywhere, indicating the heavy casualties they suffered.</p>
<h3>Intense Artillery Battles in Zhabei, Enemy Troops Ultimately Defeated by Our Forces</h3>
<p>Battle raged from yesterday until this morning</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at dawn, the enemy from Tian Tong An in Hongkou frequently launched attacks on our Zhabei positions. Our defending forces calmly responded. The enemy repeatedly attempted to break through, but were sacrificed under our concentrated machine gun and hand grenade fire, and were forced to retreat. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy forces in that area again launched attacks on our Zhabei defending forces. The enemy in the Kungmei Road area also took the same action in an attempt to restrain our forces and coordinate with the enemy forces in the Yangshupu area. The outpost skirmishes between the two sides began again, with machine gun fire as dense as a string of pearls. The stalemate continued until 6:00 p.m. yesterday, when enemy ships in the Huangpu River used heavy artillery to bombard our Zhabei forces, hoping to destroy our rear and coordinate with their attacking enemy forces. Our army also returned fire with heavy artillery, aiming directly at the enemy naval headquarters. For a time, the rumbling sound shook the area. At 8:00 p.m., the artillery fire gradually subsided, but it was still intermittent, with both sides exchanging heavy artillery fire. In addition to the artillery fire, there was also dense machine gun fire. After midnight, the artillery fire became dense again. The fighting between the two sides was exceptionally fierce. By 3:00 a.m. this morning, the enemy who had ventured out were finally defeated by our forces and retreated to their original positions.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Before dawn yesterday, enemy naval landing troops launched an attack from Tian Tong An toward our Zhabei area. Our army calmly responded, and after the enemy approached, they immediately used machine guns for concentrated fire and also attacked the enemy with hand grenades. The enemy forces suffered heavy casualties and retreated.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Yesterday evening, enemy forces shelled our Zhabei area, and we also returned fire with heavy artillery. The exchange lasted for about two hours before stopping. Then, at about 10:00 p.m. in the evening, enemy artillery again shelled our Zhabei area. In addition to returning fire with heavy artillery, we also used pursuit artillery to shell the enemy positions in the Hongkou area. Intermittent artillery fire continued until about 1:00 a.m. this morning without stopping.</p>
<h3>Enemy Again Attempts to Land in Pudong</h3>
<p>More than 40 enemy troops, divided into two small speedboats, patrolled the Huangpu River off the Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, attempting to secretly cross and land. At the same time, the enemy destroyer No. 16, anchored in the center of the river off the Mitsubishi Wharf, frequently shelled Pudong.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: At 9:40 a.m. yesterday, the enemy destroyer No. 16, anchored at the Mitsubishi Wharf, suddenly opened fire on our Lujiazui area in Pudong and then stopped. At the same time, two small boats, loaded with more than 50 enemy plainclothes troops, patrolled the Huangpu River off the Chunjiang Wharf, seemingly attempting to land.</p>
<h3>Flagship Izumo Directs Combat Operations</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The enemy flagship Izumo quietly left the No. 2 buoy opposite the Gonghexiang Wharf again last night and anchored off the Wusong Estuary to direct the combat operations of 92 enemy warships, large and small, gathered there. It only sailed back by noon yesterday.</p>
<h3>We Destroyed as Many as Three Enemy Warships</h3>
<p>According to a reliable report from military authorities, a large squadron of our air force bombed the enemy fleet off Xiaochuansha waters at about 7:00 p.m. the night before, resulting in two destroyers and one cruiser being hit and destroyed. The victory has been confirmed by our Nanjing authorities.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that at about 7:00 p.m. the night before, a squadron of our air force flew to the Xiaochuansha Estuary to bomb enemy ships. At the time, two enemy ships were hit and burned. According to official news, the two burned ships were destroyers. In addition, an enemy cruiser was also bombed and severely damaged by our aircraft.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 6th: A high-ranking military agency here received a telephone call from the Shanghai front at 10:00 p.m. tonight stating that our military aircraft fiercely bombed the enemy ships outside the Wusong Estuary, hitting two enemy destroyers and a cruiser with heavy bombs.</p>
<h3>More Than a Hundred Enemy Ships Sail into Shanghai</h3>
<p>The total number of enemy ships that have sailed into the bay now exceeds 130. According to an investigation by reporters who went to the Wusong Estuary today, most of the enemy ships are still gathered in the Wusong area, totaling 92. There are more than 20 ships in the river area of Liuhe and Xiaochuansha, and only 13 ships remain anchored in the Huangpu River. The deployment of the 92 enemy ships in the Wusong area is investigated as follows: Ten warships of the enemy's First Fleet are outside the Sanxia Water in the Wusong Estuary; one aircraft carrier (capable of carrying 60 aircraft) and one cruiser Yubari are in the Sanxia Water River area; another 15 enemy ships, large and small, are scattered in the river area; eight enemy ships are in the Wusong Estuary; 25 enemy transport ships are from outside the Sanxia Water to the Wusong Estuary; one cruiser Kiao, two No. 1 destroyers, and five transport ships, large and small, are at Yunzaobang; two No. 17 destroyers, three No. 6 gunboats, one cruiser Yura, and three Takahshi destroyers are at Zhanghuabang; and five ships, large and small, are in the Donggou Fish Market. In total, there are as many as 92 enemy ships anchored from Sanxia Water to Donggou.</p>
<h3>Five Ships Sail Out After Unloading Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Five transport ships converted from enemy merchant ships that had previously sailed into the Huangpu River were anchored at the Huishan Wharf, and two ships each were anchored at the Yuzaoyuan Road and Huangpu Wharfs. That evening, a large number of military equipment, ammunition, straw bags, and other military supplies were unloaded. At 10:20 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. yesterday, the five ships, Rangvang, Midzuho, Maru, etc., sailed out of the Huangpu River one after another. According to an investigation by reporters, several tanks, armored vehicles, and other heavy weapons were unloaded from the enemy ships anchored at the Huishan Wharf.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Beixinjing Three Times</h3>
<p>North China Daily News Condemns as Utterly Senseless</p>
<p>Beixinjing, northwest of Shanghai, was bombed by enemy planes for the third time yesterday. At about 10:00 a.m., two more enemy planes flew in from the northeast and first dropped a giant bomb at the corner of Rue Pére Robert and Route Pére Huc, at the place of the white flagpole. The bomb fell on vacant land and caused no damage. Then two bombs were dropped at the small vegetable market at the entrance of the town, killing an old woman and the child she was leading. Two more bombs were dropped near the Zhao Heqing residence near the Xiao Quan family's house, half a li east of the town, and two bombs were dropped behind the residence, all falling on vacant land and causing no damage. The residence of Shen Shaocui, a local gentry, was destroyed the day before, and a large foreign goods store in the West Market was also completely destroyed. Fifty to sixty houses were completely destroyed, and the damage and losses were numerous. The local residents fled after being robbed, and the scene was desolate. The local police force is making every effort to maintain order.</p>
<p>Further reports: Yesterday morning, two enemy planes flew over Beixin Town in circles and dropped two giant bombs in the north of the town and two in the south of the town, all of which exploded. A fully loaded ground barge was sunk along the Suzhou Creek on Route Pére Billot at No. 1 Bridge. The boat owner, Huang Jin, was injured, his wife died on the spot, and his mother was also seriously injured. Another villager, Zhu Daya, was injured in the ankle and foot and was rescued by the Red Cross 7th Ambulance Team to the team for medical treatment.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Three enemy planes bombed the Beixinjing area at about 10:00 a.m. yesterday, one of which fell and exploded near Rue Pére Huc, killing eight people and wounding two others. There was no other significant damage.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News carried a short commentary yesterday stating that if the Japanese aerial bombing campaign that caused the tragedy in the Hongkew District had military objectives, then one must say that the results obtained are completely contrary to their will. This bombing has once again caused the deaths and injuries of unfortunate refugees, and its sky-borne actions have no benefit whatsoever. The Japanese airplanes bombing the area may have a serious impact on Shanghai's food supply mechanism, as this act, in addition to destroying vegetable gardens, will also cause panic and prevent vegetable farmers from carrying vegetables to the market. Therefore, and because of other incidents, one truly cannot conceive of a motive for Japanese airplanes bombing that does not make appropriate prior arrangements and limit its military objectives. The recent case of the injury to Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen in the British memorandum to Japan touched briefly on the responsibility of aviators in this respect, but when Japanese newspapers published the article, they deleted it, recording only the remedies that the British desired, and crossed out the calm, sincere, and valuable principles, which is truly lamentable.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Again Sortie to Drop Bombs Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that yesterday afternoon, several squadrons of enemy aircraft were dispatched, first four aircraft, then two each, passing over the First Special District and heading north, circling and reconnoitering over the downtown area of Yinxiang Township, and dropping more than ten bombs near the racecourse. After about a quarter of an hour, two more aircraft chased after them and formed a small team, while another aircraft flew east to reconnoiter back and forth over Yangshupu. At that time, sparse artillery fire could be heard faintly in the downtown area. At the same time, in Pudong, another 13 aircraft formed a circular formation in the Gaogiao area by the coast. Then one aircraft flew low to reconnoiter over the Laiyi Ferry, frequently strafing pedestrians on the street with machine guns. The sound of the guns could be heard across the Huangpu River. Pudong Road and the area near the Ruiyong Shipyard Wharf were bombed. At about 2:00 p.m., the aircraft gathered into a large squadron and headed southwest, harassing the area along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that at about 7:00 a.m. yesterday, more than ten enemy planes circled the skies of Shanghai for about two hours, first forming a large squadron over the Shanghai South area and observing for a long time, then dividing into several small teams and dropping bombs in Zhabei, Pudong, Shanghai West, and other places. Particularly heavy bombing occurred in the Zhabei area, and machine gun strafing was also used. Our garrison fired back with anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns, and the enemy planes then fled.</p>
<h3>Facts About the Heavy Casualties Suffered by the Enemy</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that yesterday morning (the 6th), 400 to 500 injured Japanese soldiers and sailors were seen on the Bund, carried on stretchers from transport ships and warships anchored under the Japanese Consulate General to the shore. This is sufficient proof that the Japanese Navy encountered strong resistance from Chinese forces when landing at Wusong. If transport ships and destroyers need to transport such a large number of wounded soldiers, then the actual number of injured in the past day or two must be two or three times this number. Moreover, a Japanese hospital ship has been anchored in its fleet for half a month. Now that these wounded soldiers must be transported to the shore for treatment, one can imagine how many more wounded soldiers the hospital ship and another warship used to house the wounded have taken in. As for how many soldiers and sailors drowned while landing, it is impossible to estimate, but the number must not be small either.</p>
<h3>The Ridiculous Waste of Military Supplies by the Enemy</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that a certain foreigner idly strolled along the Bund and said that there was a Chinese soldier lying in ambush on the Bund who occasionally fired at Japanese gunboats or destroyers, costing about seven corners (a unit of currency) worth of bullets. The cost of the Japanese naval guns was about seventy yuan. Whenever the Japanese ships encountered Chinese soldiers firing, they would fire several one-inch shells at the firing direction. As a result, the Chinese soldiers stopped firing, but an hour later, they fired one or two more shots, and the Japanese ships fired several more shells. This firing and stopping, this stopping and firing, the Chinese soldiers who fired cold shots seemed to be safely hidden and unharmed, while the Japanese ships were very busy. This kind of action is like a game of hide-and-seek and is very laughable. According to the report, each one-inch shell is worth about ten U.S. dollars, and for every one or two shots fired by the Chinese, the Japanese respond with four or five shells.</p>
<h3>Westerners Donate Money to Comfort Our Defending Army</h3>
<p>A Westerner named H. Notreh recently wrote to the Continental Daily, saying that the Chinese defending army is loyally defending the country near Shanghai, which we deeply admire. We, who live in China, should sympathize with China's cause and voluntarily contribute to these defending forces to express our admiration for their courage. I am now making a first donation of fifty yuan to initiate this and hope that many other foreigners will respond and assist in this valuable cause.</p>
<h3>Formal Reply by Our Authorities to Joint Note of America, Britain and France</h3>
<p>Because Japanese troops Attempt to Land in Pudong, the Responsibility Lies Entirely with the Japanese Side; Japanese Ships Should Withdraw from the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The military authorities of the United States, Britain, and France in Shanghai, citing the heavy shelling on the Huangpu River on the 3rd, and that stray bullets falling within the Public and French Concessions have caused significant losses of life and property, specially requested the consuls general of their respective countries in Shanghai to send notes to our country and the Japanese authorities on the 4th, requesting that Japanese ships should move south of the China Merchants Bureau North Bund and that our Pudong troops should move east of Pudong Road and south of Zhangjiabang. The note sent to our country was forwarded by Mayor Yu to the military authorities. The reply from the military authorities was received yesterday and immediately sent to the US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, the British Acting Consul General in Shanghai, Davidson, and the French Consul General in Shanghai, Bodes, requesting them to forward it to the naval commanders-in-chief of their respective countries. The original letter stated: Dear Sirs, regarding your letter of the 4th of this month, enclosing a recommendation from the naval commanders of the United States, Britain, and France, this mayor has forwarded it to the military authorities of this country and replied to each of you on file. Now, the military authorities of this country believe that the Japanese side is relying on the concessions as a base for invading troops to attack our army, causing our resisting troops to suffer everywhere. In order to protect the lives and property of Chinese and foreigners within the concessions, our side is still responding with the greatest patience and painstaking effort, which is understood by all countries. Because the Japanese troops are attempting to land in the Pudong area, stray bullets have affected the concessions. Since our side is the victim of aggression and is defending itself within its own territory, it is naturally justified. The responsibility lies entirely with the Japanese side. The American, British, and French authorities should be notified to find a way to make the Japanese ships withdraw from the Huangpu River, and such incidents should not occur. I am sending this letter to you for your information and request that you forward it to the naval commanders-in-chief of the United States, Britain, and France for their information.</p>

<h3>President Wang's Speech on National Salvation Bonds (Continued)</h3>
<p>Therefore, modern warfare is not just about military strength, but also about financial strength. If we understand that we can endure and then achieve victory, then we must make a firm resolution and make great efforts to figure out how to endure. Yesterday's newspapers, fellow countrymen, you all saw that the Japanese Provisional Diet held an opening ceremony on the 4th of this month. The so-called special account for provisional military expenses for the China Incident is over 120 million yen, and the general account's additional budget is over 420 million yen. The source of these provisional military expenses is mostly the issuance of public bonds. The total amount for this year's top calculation is therefore more than 547.1 million yen. The issuance of public bonds this year will be around 330 to 440 million yen. During the Russo-Japanese War, the total war expenses were only 150.847 million yen. The military expenses for the Sino-Japanese Incident, before and after, totaled 250 million yen. This amount is really insignificant compared to our so-called issuance of 500 million yuan in national salvation bonds. No wonder the invasionists are boasting, saying they will subdue us in a short period of time. However, we can confidently say that we will never see our surrender in the shortest period of time, only the collapse of the enemy. What is used to support the enemy's military expenses is for the purpose of aggression. The burden of military expenses is borne by a small number of capitalists and a large number of common people. These capitalists and common people are being forced by the invasionists. They don't have a good peaceful life, but they have to squeeze out their blood and sweat to support the war. The unhappiness in their hearts can be imagined. Moreover, this kind of war has no end. When China is exhausted, Japan will be exhausted. At that time, it will be no different than exposing loopholes to various countries, giving them opportunities. Every capitalist and every commoner in Japan cannot help but be chilled by this, and cannot help but hate the invasionists. The more severely the aggression is suppressed, the more severe the hatred will be. Its collapse is inevitable. As for the military expenses we are paying, it is for resisting aggression, for avoiding becoming slaves of a fallen nation. When the invaders squeeze blood and sweat from us, it is indeed painful. However, it is worth enduring these pains to avoid the pain of becoming slaves of a fallen nation. Therefore, our burden comes from our own willingness. As long as the government uses every drop of this blood and sweat for the war of resistance, as long as the soldiers use every bit of this blood and sweat to its fullest extent during the war of resistance, the people will definitely take out all their blood and sweat. In this way, the more the enemy invades, the more it collapses, and the more we resist, the more united we become. Although the enemy has more in terms of the numerical figures of military expenses, we are more determined and enthusiastic than the enemy in terms of the psychology of bearing military expenses. There is another point, we are still an agricultural country, we are still unable to completely get rid of the economic situation of handicrafts, and we have not yet fully entered the economic situation of modern industry.

<h3>Yellow River Breach at Putai</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangrong is responsible for the aftermath</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Yellow River breached its banks in Putai County, causing a disaster. The economic council dispatched technical officer Wang Huzhen and Dutch hydraulic consultant Wan Hefo to Putai to conduct an actual inspection of the breach. In addition, Huangshui Commissioner Kong Xiangrong personally went to inspect and was responsible for the aftermath. Although the Yangtze River's water level is close to the highest record, the Jing water conservancy agency received a report from Wuhan on the 7th that the water level had slightly dropped to 48 feet. In case the upstream rises again, there is still a risk of disaster in the middle and lower reaches. Today, the Japanese寇 are invading China, and the whole country is united in resisting the war. It is hoped that the people of the country will resist the war and prevent disasters, so that猛鍬 floods can be fundamentally eliminated. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>

(National Telegraph on the 7th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a reply to the UK today, stating briefly that, according to the current investigation results, it cannot be proved that Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was hit by a Japanese military aircraft, but the Japanese government expresses its deep regret for Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's unfortunate injury when a battle occurred in the Taicang area that day. The reply also denies the British letter's claim that Japanese military aircraft arbitrarily attacked non-combatant civilians, but said that the Japanese government has instructed the Japanese military authorities in Chinese territory to be particularly cautious about this matter. (Domei News Agency on the 7th)</p>
<p>[London] The interim reply sent by the Japanese government to the United Kingdom was released this afternoon. Its contents expressed warm sympathy to the British government, and stated that the Japanese government has instructed the local authorities to investigate the circumstances. The investigation results have not proven that the Japanese aircraft was responsible for the attack. A second investigation is underway. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether Japan should be responsible for this incident. However, Japan still expresses its apology and has issued new instructions to the local Japanese authorities, ordering them to avoid attacking civilians. The Japanese government also hopes that the British authorities can cooperate with the Japanese authorities to avoid similar incidents from happening again. If British officials and civilians enter dangerous areas in the future, please notify the Japanese authorities in advance. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 7th)</p>

Although the reply expresses apology for the injury of the British ambassador, it claims that the Japanese authorities have not strictly investigated the case. The British government still insists that Japan should give a detailed reply to the requirements raised in the British note. The new British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, is currently consulting with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota to achieve this goal. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the case of British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen being injured by a Japanese aircraft bombing, after the United Kingdom submitted a note on the 28th of last month, responsible sources recently confirmed that the 常京 government has submitted an interim nature reply, the content of which states the Japanese government's apology for this case, but said that the investigation has not been rigorously handled, so it is not possible to formally reply. It is now known that the British government will firmly request that Japan promptly submit a complete and clear reply. The new British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, is currently conducting talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota on this matter. British responsible sources also said that the Japanese government believes that it has not yet been determined whether the perpetrator was the country's air force personnel. This can be seen from the use of "apology" instead of "道歡" in the interim reply. This interim reply has greatly disappointed the British side. It is reported that Ambassador Robert Craigie will not present his credentials until the three requirements raised in the British note are fully met. As for the official Japanese reply, if it cannot be considered satisfactory by the British, the British government may recall its ambassador. British political figures also said that if Japan wants to delay the matter and thinks that the British attitude will gradually soften, then it will be unbearable.

<p>[Tokyo] Navy Minister 米內 stated in the parliament today regarding the note sent by the British government to Japan regarding the injury of the British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen that the Japanese navy will never take any inhumane actions under any circumstances. Seiyukai member東武 said that the British note greatly damaged Japan's prestige, and its implication that the Japanese army is a barbaric army that often engages in Liang井 combatants. Before Navy Minister 米內's speech, former Foreign Minister 廣田 rose and said that there was no clear evidence to prove that the British Ambassador's car was bombed by a Japanese aircraft, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs firmly believes that the Japanese army never intentionally attacks non-combatants.

<h3>British, American, and French Newspapers Unanimously Sympathize with Us</h3>
<p>It is imperative to economically control Japan. Even pro-Japanese newspapers are worried about Japan.</p>
<p>[New York] A certain Chinese newspaper leader's investigation of the American public opinion's criticism of the Sino-Japanese War has ended today. According to his report to the Associated Press, American public opinion strongly supports China's views. At the same time, Xu Huazi, the general manager of the Pacific News Agency, also said that the agency analyzed hundreds of newspaper reviews and comics across the country, and nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a thousand were inclined towards China. It can be seen that the sentiment of the American public is very sympathetic to China. Xu also said that, in his opinion, the United States should take definite action at this time. This action, while not necessarily involving the Far Eastern war situation, is sufficient to prevent the current slaughter in China. Recently, Mr. Song Ziwen had a conversation with a reporter from the Associated Press, advocating that democratic countries of the world should react by jointly implementing economic sanctions to avoid the spread of war to the whole world. Mr. Xu fully agreed with this proposal. Mr. Meng, director of the Chinese Society, also said today that economic sanctions are the most effective way to deal with Japan. Although there may be dangers in implementing sanctions at present, they can prevent greater dangers after implementation. In the past, sanctions by various countries have not been effective, but Japan's geographical location is different from that of Italy, because Japan cannot retaliate against countries that implement sanctions. (National Telegraph on the 6th)</p>
<p>[London] The usually pro-Japanese Morning Post also mentioned today the seriousness of Japan's recent increase in forecasts, saying that the total amount of this forecast expenditure is almost equal to the amount of wood forecast, and it is necessary to raise more than 川 million yuan in debt. This type of estimate is obviously based on the assumption that the war against China will not be excessively prolonged. Many people believe that China and Japan do not seem to be engaged in a long-term war. Japan's expenses are not limited to war expenses. The complete cessation of its trade with China, which is a heavy loss, must also be taken into account. The newspaper father mentioned the danger of Japan's large-scale domestic debt, saying that borrowing will inevitably lead to a large amount of lending sections, which is actually equivalent to currency inflation, and will eventually lead to financial and social chaos. Therefore, as far as Japan is concerned, if it engages in a long-term war with China, even if it can raise war expenses, it will inevitably suffer major economic difficulties. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>[London] The British Trades Union Congress held its annual meeting today, with about a thousand representatives attending. Chairman Bowen mentioned that the bombing of the British Ambassador by Japanese aircraft had caused great public anger. He said that we are deeply saddened by the bombing of the British Ambassador, but the Japanese have been massacring non-combatants in China for冬月. This kind of basal behavior has awakened the conscience of the masses, and the result may be to demand that our government end its weak actions in dealing with such incidents. Bowen also hoped that the Spanish democratic army would win the victory. 未讀, He believed that the British Trades Union Congress would all sympathize with the efforts of the Chinese people today to defend the sovereignty of their homes and make them complete and undamaged. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Newspapers have recently commented on the Sino-Japanese War, among which the Communist Party 人道報1 made a comment on the Chinese government's appeal to the League of Nations, briefly stating that the League of Nations Covenant must be implemented. If countries want to maintain world peace, they must assist China in various forms. The right-wing "Paris Echo" said, "The Soviet Union will assist China, but Soviet diplomacy is cautious and self-sustaining, which is inevitably strange. Japan is conducting a large-scale invasion of China in the Soviet Union's neighboring area, which is almost an invasion of the Soviet Union, but the Soviet official is as if he has turned a blind eye. Why?" The moderate "Order Newspaper" issued a warning, saying, "If Japan can control China, the danger is very great." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<h3>Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce Cables Hull to Request a Statement of Specific Policies</h3>
<p>Expresses Shock at Roosevelt's Order to Withdraw僑. American Businessmen Decide to Continue Business in Shanghai</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from this Newspaper) The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai held a meeting at the Citibank General Assembly Hall at 12:30 yesterday to discuss the US government's Far East policy. It was decided that Chairman普蘭德 will send a telegram to US Secretary of State Hull, the content of which stated, "The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai strongly opposes the US official issuing certain remarks, which are interpreted as the United States intends to withdraw or abandon its commercial interests in China, so as to avoid serious damage to the US prestige." This move by the American Chamber of Commerce was caused by President Roosevelt's warning last Sunday that all American expatriates in China should withdraw. Furthermore, US Consul General in Shanghai高斯 sent a letter to Mr.普蘭德, Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, yesterday afternoon, briefly stating that the current situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. He strongly urged all American expatriates in the interior to withdraw immediately. Even within the public concession, the US government's ability to protect expatriates is also limited by the environment. The American Chamber of Commerce, based on the firm opinions of the majority of American businessmen, sent a telegram to Premier Hull, so as to promote the US government to further clarify specific policies. (國民社)</p>
<p>The English-language Great America Evening News said that the Great America Evening News interviewed several well-known American businessmen in Shanghai today (7th). They all said that they were determined to stay in Shanghai to protect the commercial interests of Americans, regardless of whether the US government supported it or not. Their determination would not change. Several of them were quite shocked to hear that President Roosevelt had ordered all American expatriates to leave Shanghai, saying that if they still stayed, they would be taking risks. They still believed that President Roosevelt's words were based on false rumors, and cited the fact that more than 1,200 American sailors had come to Shanghai to protect the lives and property of American expatriates as proof. They were extremely unhappy with Secretary of State Hull's declaration that the United States would not cooperate with other countries on the Far East crisis, and that the warning to American expatriates to withdraw could not be more severe than this. Hull also said that cooperation should not be confused with joint action. The US government is currently only consulting and exchanging views with the relevant powers. Six well-known German businessmen in Shanghai also expressed their opinions on the international dispute, saying that the US President obviously did not clearly understand that the businesses of various countries in Shanghai are closely related to each other. The German businessmen did not take pleasure in the fact that American businessmen leaving Shanghai would reduce competition. They said that the interests of various countries in China are shared, and the internationalization and complexity of common businesses is actually greater than in any other place. The Director-General of the工部局, Fessenden, also expressed his opinion today, saying that he believed that the report of President Roosevelt's remarks was inconsistent with the truth of the overall situation. Although Americans staying in Shanghai will be taking risks, he believed that the 1,200 American sailors who are currently on their way to Shanghai will still be responsible for protecting the lives and property of American expatriates. The United States will never abandon the interests of Americans here and put them in danger. Gilman of茂生洋行 said that Americans have been doing business in Shanghai for decades. Even if they lose protection, they are unwilling to easily give up their lives. Americans are willing to find opportunities here on their own. Anyone with a career and responsibility must stay in Shanghai, regardless of their personal safety. 華古, the general manager of美孚火油公司, said that the US President's remarks were really surprising.美孚公司 is still operating as usual. Well-known lawyer亞爾曼 said that the United States does not necessarily have to engage in war to protect the interests of美人 in Shanghai, but he felt that the United States must take a firm policy to protect American rights. The current actions of the US Navy and consular representatives reflect its weak policy, which is regrettable, because it will lose the respect of the Chinese people for the Americans. The opinions expressed by the remaining few people were generally similar. Everyone believed that the US government's order for American expatriates to withdraw from Shanghai was a mistake and advocated that it be corrected. They would never blindly follow the President's order and lightly leave Shanghai, so that the reputation of Americans in the Far East would be wiped out in one fell swoop. Their determination was very firm. The Americans are now planning to publicly express their opinions and believe that the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai is the proper agency to make this expression. These opinions will be published in newspapers and telegraphed to Washington. Today, many well-known American expatriates have telephoned the chamber's secretary,郝和斯, requesting that a meeting be held as soon as possible to discuss and decide on a method to express a firm policy to the American authorities. After the telegram is sent to Washington in the future, it will definitely be able to reverse the general direction of the American authorities.</p>
<h3>Japan Illegally Blockades Entire Coast and Illegally Searches British and Italian Merchant Ships</h3>
<p>Two Swire Company Ships Temporarily Suspend Operations. Various Companies Will Report to Their Home Countries to Protest</p>
<p>After Japan illegally blockaded our entire coastline, it stated that in addition to shelling our country's merchant ships when they sailed to the blockaded area, it had decided to absolutely respect and not interfere with peaceful merchant ships of third countries. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Naval Ministry have repeatedly stated this matter during the second blockade. In fact, this is far from the truth. British and Italian merchant ships have now been involved in incidents of being interfered with by Japanese warships. Two ships of Swire Company in Shanghai, the 蕪湖 and 武穴, departed from Chaozhou, South China, for Shanghai on the 6th. These ships were hired by the潮州𣃮沪同鄕會 to send refugees back to their hometowns. This time they returned to Shanghai from Fujian empty. Unexpectedly, they were stopped by Japanese warships outside Wusongkou, who wanted to send people on board to search. The shipowners strictly refused and did not allow them to board the ship to search. The Japanese then issued a tough and unreasonable order to the two shipowners, saying that the two ships would not be allowed to装载 refugees for export this time, otherwise they would not be allowed to leave. At the same time, the Italian mail ship龍山輪 was also searched twice when it entered the port before being allowed to enter. It is reported that the two British and Italian shipping companies will report to their home governments so that they can lodge protests with the Japanese. Furthermore, according to Swire Company, the 蕪湖 and 武穴 originally wanted to装运 the潮州旅沪同鄕會 refugees for export again, but because they were suddenly illegally prevented by the Japanese, they had to sail out of the Huangpu River with empty ships and anchored on the扎裹銅沙洋面 at 3 pm yesterday. As for the龍山輪, it still carried more than 3,000 Ningbo refugees for export at about 11:30 yesterday morning. At the same time, the British ship Sichuan, which entered the port at 3 pm yesterday, carried rice from Saigon to Shanghai and was also inspected by Japanese warships along the way, but they did not board the ship to search. Furthermore, the順天輪, which departed for Tianjin yesterday, was also monitored by Japanese warships.</p>
<p>Since the enemy self-blockaded the seaports in the North and South Oceans, it has been heard that the enemy's navy has dispatched three destroyer squadrons (a total of twelve ships) to patrol the southeastern coasts of our country. Because our country's merchant ships had already automatically suspended sailing, our country's ships disappeared from the coastal ports of Nanhua. The enemy's blockade did not hinder us at all. According to a certain British ship crew member who came to Shanghai from North China, he told reporters yesterday that he saw two Japanese warships sailing on the sea when he came from the North Ocean, seemingly probing whether there were any traces of Chinese ships in Longkou and Yantai. If they saw any empty停之 ships, they also planned to detain them, but they found nothing. By the time the ship passed the 大戢山洋面 to the area around 裹銅沙, they also saw a Japanese warship, seemingly patrolling the coast of Zhejiang. It is reported that the Japanese warships, in a "nothing to do" situation, had to detain and inspect the two Chinese fishing boats that they happened to see on the sea. In addition to this, because no Chinese ships were found, they even captured the "anti-smuggling patrol ships" of the customs, which were non-combatant 関的. It was also heard today that Shanghai inspected merchant ships from third countries, while Zhagang forcibly prevented the British ship Taishan from sailing to Hong Kong and Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Consult on Cooperation Methods for Blockade</h3>
<p>If the British and American navies blockade Japan, Japan's forces will collapse in four months</p>
<p>[Washington] Well-informed sources recently announced that the British and American authorities have recently conducted informal talks to consider how to jointly act and deal with it if the merchant ships of each country are threatened after the Japanese navy blockades the Chinese coast. According to sources in the United States, the United States has requested Britain to dispatch at least six warships from the Mediterranean to the Far East, but Britain has hesitated, saying that Britain's interests in the Mediterranean are more important than those in the Far East. The United States replied that Britain's interests in the Mediterranean area should be protected by faster warships. As for the Far East, the arrival of warships can increase the prestige of the tributary countries, and it is also a beneficial warning to Japan. In addition, Britain and the United States were heard to have informally studied a plan to jointly blockade Japan, so that if Japan's actions in the Chinese sea are too arbitrary, and when they夺取 British and American ships on the high seas, they will be implemented. Regarding this level, American naval personnel believe that blockading Japan is easier than blockading Italy. All goods entering Japan, except those shipped from China, must pass through the two major naval bases belonging to Britain and the United States, namely Singapore and巴玛河. British and American naval authorities have also explained to President Roosevelt that implementing a blockade at the above-mentioned two locations can be based on Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. After the reward is implemented, all of Japan's strength can be broken within four months. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Japanese Navy's blockade of the Chinese coast, British officials recently announced that the UK will not tolerate the Japanese Navy inspecting British ships. However, the Japanese government has ordered its navy to only intercept foreign ships so that their nationality can be ascertained, and not to inspect them. As of now, no British ships have been intercepted, so the British government does not intend to make representations to the Japanese government. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>[London] The legal issue of Japan's blockade of the Chinese coast is being closely considered here. The Japanese government has not declared war, and its actions are against public law. The British government will probably determine its attitude based on future trends. The public generally believes that unless a major incident occurs, that is, a real interference with British ships, the British government will not make serious representations to the Japanese government.

<h3>Japanese Warship Reappears Outside the Pearl River Estuary</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] A Japanese destroyer, which detained two Chinese customs patrol boats on Sunday night, reappeared outside the Pearl River Estuary today. It was still towing the customs patrol boats. British officers Mr. Jones and Mr. Douglas, who were on the customs patrol boats, made no criticism of the Japanese destroyer's actions after landing. However, according to local sources, the Japanese destroyer was in British territorial waters at the time, while the customs patrol boats were in Chinese territorial waters. The customs patrol boats ignored the signal to stop, so the Japanese warship fired, killing a Chinese seaman on the [boat name]. Mr. Jones was standing next to the man at the time and narrowly escaped injury. The two patrol boats then stopped, and the Japanese warship approached them. The three [nationality of the] ship’s crew disembarked in a small boat, while the Chinese seamen were driven to the deck and guarded by Japanese sailors with rifles.

<p>Enemy Warship Uses Concession Territorial Waters to Loot Customs Vessel - Violates International Law, Requests Attention</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] On the 6th, a Japanese warship looted two of our customs anti-smuggling vessels within Hong Kong territorial waters. 刁作謙刁作謙, Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs of Guangdong and Guangxi, pointed out that the enemy warship's use of concession territorial waters to loot customs vessels unrelated to wartime is intolerable under international law.

<h3>Nazi Party Congress, Mediterranean Conference Not Yet Opened, Hitler's Declaration</h3>
<p>Germany-Japan Alliance Must Not Be Shaken - Calls on the World to Maintain Peace</p>
<p>⊙ Nuremberg. The leader of the South Bavarian National Socialist Party today read Hitler's declaration to the Ninth Congress of the National Socialist Party. He reiterated Germany's demands for colonies and said that the Four-Year Plan must be thoroughly implemented. German-Italian friendship must be strengthened, and the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan must not be shaken. He also called on the people of the world to maintain peace. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>⊙ Nuremberg. The Ninth Annual Congress of the National Socialist Party opened at 6:00 this morning. Führer Hitler attended in person. Minister without Portfolio Hess delivered the opening speech, followed by the reading of Führer Hitler's instructions. He first recounted the achievements of the National Socialist Party over the past ten years, then vehemently attacked Bolshevism, saying that it ignores genuine social problems. He stated that the national economy is related to the public interest and should be controlled by the government. Germany's demand for the return of pre-war colonies to ensure its people have sufficient food and water is justified. He continued by saying that the Treaty of Versailles is now a scrap of paper, and Germany has regained its freedom. The German army should be a bulwark of German freedom. From now on, the world will not be able to ignore the will of the German people. As for the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan, its purpose is to protect the civilized world from aggression. This is already evident in Spain today and may be seen in the East tomorrow, and it may even extend to other parts of the world in the future. He continued, "Today, Germany is no longer isolated. Germany has formed close friendships with major powers. The interests of National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy are completely aligned, which is the most important safety factor. This can be proven by the events of the past few months." (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>⊙ Nuremberg. The Ninth Congress of the National Socialist Party will be held here. Hitler arrived here by plane today and then entered the city by car. Crowds lined the streets to watch. Black Guards were lined up [along the streets]. The congress will last for a week and will include parades and public meetings. Hitler will deliver a speech on the 11th. Germany's unemployment problem has now been solved, so this congress will be named "Work Revival." More than 260,000 members of the National Socialist Party have gathered here, all living in tents, including 40,000 members of the Labor Corps. The congress will also express German-Italian friendship, so a large number of Italians have come here by special train to witness the event. A large-scale anti-Bolshevik exhibition will also be held. (Reuter dispatch from Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>⊙ Nuremberg. The Ninth Congress of the National Socialist Party opened here at 5:00 PM yesterday. Hitler arrived by plane from Munich before 4:00 PM, accompanied by German Labor Front leader Ley and Black Shirt leader Hitler [sic - likely a typo for Himmler or some other prominent Nazi figure]. Deputy Chancellor Hess welcomed him at the airport. Nuremberg is an old German capital with a medieval city style. Currently, during the National Socialist Party congress, the streets are filled with party members wearing uniforms of various National Socialist Party organizations. More than 600 domestic and foreign reporters are participating. Envoys from various countries arrived here by special train last night. The British and French ambassadors and the American Chargé d'Affaires have all arrived. The Italian delegation is led by Vice Foreign Minister Bastianini, with a particularly large number of people.

<h3>Mediterranean Conference Has Not Yet Opened, Serious Dispute Between Russia and Italy</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Protests Strongly Against Italian Warship Sinking Merchant Ship - Believes it is Inhumane and Violates International Law - Demands Compensation and Punishment, Italy Has Refused</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet Union's note to Italy states that the Soviet government holds ironclad evidence of Italian warships acting aggressively against Soviet merchant ships, and lists the facts of Italian submarines sinking and attacking Soviet ships. It continues by saying that such actions are a great violation of humanitarian principles and the most basic principles of international law recognized, and are far from the 1933 Italian-Soviet agreement. The Soviet government hereby lodges the strongest protest to Italy, and holds Italy fully responsible for the political and material consequences. The Soviet Union demands that Italy cease its aggression, fully compensate the Soviet government and the sailors of the attacked and sunk ships for their losses, and punish the perpetrators. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Well-informed sources believe that the Soviet government's note to Italy is not only a protest but also a warning. If Italy ignores this warning, then another action should be taken. It is also not surprising that Italy refuses the Soviet government's protest, because it is difficult to expect a country accused of being a "pirate" to admit its guilt. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The Italian government recently issued a public statement saying that the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires recently delivered a note to Foreign Minister Count Ciano, attributing the responsibility for the sinking of two of the country's transport ships in the Mediterranean Sea to Italy, demanding that the Italian government compensate for the damage and punish those responsible. The Foreign Minister immediately replied that the cases were not related to Italy, so the Italian government could not accept the demands made by the Soviet government. "Semi-official Italian sources recently commented on the Soviet move, saying that its intention was to disrupt the Mediterranean Conference. The Foreign Minister's response adequately explained Italy's position and was very appropriate. It is not surprising that the Soviet Union adopted such an attitude when the Italian government was preparing to accept the invitations from the British and French governments to participate in the Mediterranean Conference, with the intention of disrupting the conference. It is a general understanding that the Italian government's attitude towards the situation, although extremely calm, is also extremely firm." (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the convening of the Mediterranean Conference, British government officials declared, "This conference must, in any case, be made to achieve something." The purpose of the conference is to determine practical measures to prevent piracy in the Mediterranean Sea. The British and French governments have decided to avoid all theoretical debates that are inconsistent with this purpose. They also plan to appoint a committee of naval experts immediately after the opening of the conference to deal with technical issues, while all political issues can be put aside as much as possible.

<h3>German Merchants Extremely Outraged by Enemy Blockade of the Eastern District</h3>
<p>Have Telegraphed Government to Protest</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army in Shanghai announced the blockade of the eastern district of the Public Concession, various foreign merchants in the city have consulted with the Japanese military authorities, requesting that foreign goods in the eastern district be protected and moved out.

It is now heard that the Shanghai German Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce on the 3rd of this month, requesting the government to seriously protest against this action by the Japanese government. It is also heard that other foreign chambers of commerce in Shanghai have expressed the same intention.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Solicitation General Team of National Salvation Bonds sent a letter to the fundraising sub-teams of various trade associations yesterday, saying that soliciting National Salvation Bonds is an urgent task at present. The number of subscriptions from various companies, businesses, factories, and stores has been approved by the Solicitation General Team as 5% based on the amount of capital and 10% based on the amount of public reserves. Those with special circumstances may increase or decrease the amount. The above method has also been sent by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to the various associations for distribution. A survey form has been specially prepared and distributed to your sub-team for application.

<h3>Commercial Notes Difficult to Approve</h3>
<p>Reply Received from the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>In response to the request from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to forward the method of issuing Shanghai commercial notes by the Silk and Satin Industry Association, the Ministry of Finance specially replied yesterday, saying, "Received. After the announcement of the measures to stabilize finance, the Ministry has approved four supplementary measures by the Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association to facilitate the flow of funds for industry and commerce. Moreover, the Shanghai Four-Bank Joint Discount Committee has long been established, and the discount method is now more leniently regulated. All discounted funds are paid in legal currency, and there is no shortage of tokens. The request to issue wartime commercial notes by the Chamber of Commerce and the Silver and Money Industry Association will inevitably damage the currency policy, change commodity prices, affect people's livelihood, and have infinite harm. It is difficult to approve. Please forward this notice for information." This is the reply.</p>
<h3>National Merchant Ships Open New Route to Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Since the northern and southern ports have been blockaded by enemy troops, our country's merchant ships have long been suspended. The Xiamen-Philippines route merchant ship Haiheng of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has recently sailed to Manila and is temporarily docked because Xiamen is also within the enemy warship blockade line. The ships Haiyuan, Haili, and Haizhen are also moored in Hong Kong. In order to seek new overseas routes for the four Hai ships and in response to repeated requests from overseas Chinese in various places in Southeast Asia and Singapore, the bureau plans to open the Southeast Asian Islands route. In view of the unexpectedly prosperous business of the past Xiamen-Philippines route, it is deeply known that the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia love the national merchant ships. Once the route is opened, it will be very promising in terms of business. The bureau has now sent Zeng Guangqing, director of the business department, to Hong Kong and Singapore to prepare. Zeng has arrived in Hong Kong and is proceeding smoothly. Soon, our country's new Southeast Asian route will be realized, and the ships will also be expanded to Siam, Yangon, and other places. Our country has never had merchant ships sailing to Southeast Asia. In this serious national crisis, the route has been expanded abroad, which is also good news.</p>

<h3>Improved Methods for Consoling Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Supervised and Managed by the Comfort Association, Comfort Providers Must Obey Guidance</p>
<p>In the past, various wounded soldier hospitals, in accordance with the authorities' orders, refused comfort from various sectors in order to prevent the leakage of military information, which was very inconvenient for various sectors. Now, the Shanghai All Sectors Anti-Enemy Support Association has invited representatives from the Red Cross Society and other organizations to discuss and formulate improved methods. The following is a summary: ❶ In order to prevent malpractices in consoling wounded soldiers, a supervision method should be adopted, managed by the Shanghai City Comfort Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Comfort Association). ❷ The Comfort Association may appoint a number of staff members as comfort specialists, each responsible for one to two hospitals. ❸ If various groups or individuals wish to comfort wounded soldiers or donate items, they must consult with the Comfort Association in advance, arrange the hospital and date, and be led by the comfort specialist to and from on time. ❹ When various groups or individuals visit wounded soldier hospitals to express their condolences, they must absolutely obey the guidance and supervision of the comfort specialist and doctors. ❺ The comfort specialist has the right to inspect the comfort items donated by various groups or individuals, and may order the donor to try them if necessary. ❻ Comfort personnel must not speak loudly or give speeches to wounded soldiers, and must not inquire about the battle situation or affiliated troops. ❼ The comfort time is scheduled for 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. ❽ Comfort to seriously wounded hospitals or seriously wounded officers is temporarily suspended. ❾ These measures will be reported by the Shanghai All Sectors Anti-Enemy Support Association to the party and government organs for the record and implementation.

<h3>Enemy Invades Downtown Area, Our Troops Fight to the Death, Killing Enemies Like Flies</h3>
<p>Enemy retreats in disarray, corpses littering the riverside. Fierce battles in Luodian yesterday, heavy casualties. Baoshan defenders determined to defend the city to the death.</p>
<p>Since the 6th, the focus of the war has shifted from Luodian to Baoshan. For a time, the enemy concentrated its naval, land, and air forces to launch a fierce attack on our army's positions in Baoshan. The Baoshan county seat, located on the riverbank, was originally not a military fortress. However, according to the enemy's operational plan, it initially tried to take Luodian with all its strength, thinking it would be the base for the overall war. Now that Luodian is not going smoothly, it has changed its strategy to attack Yanghang from the Wusong, Wenzaobang, and Zhanghuabang areas, and then take Liuhang, attempting to open a line to Luodian. This plan was also unsuccessful. For the third time, starting on the 6th, it advanced along the river towards Baoshan, hoping to occupy the isolated city of Baoshan as a rear base, to then peep into Yuepu and Yanghang, and launch a fierce attack on Luodian in separate directions. Now that Baoshan has not fallen, and the advancing troops are being forced back by our elite reinforcements, suffering heavy casualties, its planned plans have been greatly hit. Now our army has approached the city, very close to the enemy, echoing each other inside and outside. Although the enemy has reinforced twice, it will be difficult to succeed. Fierce battles have been fought in Luodian for a long time, and the melee charge is unprecedented. As a result, the enemy has suffered many casualties, and our army has a great advantage. The vanguard connects to Yuepu in the east, confronting the enemy along Tianjia Lane and Gujing Pond, while the left wing is fighting with the enemy along the Jiejing River and Changqiao, and continues to advance, completing the steps of a large encirclement. Although the enemy there can still maintain contact with the ships at Chuanshakou, it is difficult to develop. As for the enemy from Wusongkou to Wenzaobang and Zhanghuabang, it is possible to seek contact with Yangshupu. Yesterday, it tried its best to advance from Qiujiang Wharf, attempting to attack our Yinxiang Township and Jiangwan city center. It was caught up by our large reinforcements and attacked from three sides. The enemy finally collapsed and retreated. They are now confronting each other between Wuquan Road and Jungong Road. The enemy in Zhabei Jiangwan Road, although occasionally disturbing, seems to be a counterattack on the surface, but in fact it is a support for the enemy in the eastern district, and it is impossible to break through our army's position. Moreover, from Zhanghuabang to Paotaiwan, it has been cut in two by us. Looking at yesterday day and night, the battles on all fronts were extremely fierce. The enemy tried to unite all fronts into one, while we vowed to break them separately and annihilate their strength. It is expected that the main war is not far away.</p>
<h3>Enemy at Qiujiang Wharf Attacks the City Center, Repelled by Our Three-Sided Counterattack</h3>
<p>Currently in stalemate between Wuquan Road and Jungong Road. The enemy suffered heavy casualties due to attacks from both the front and rear.</p>
<p>On the Qiujiang Wharf front, the enemy advanced rapidly after landing, once approaching the city center. After our large reinforcements from the south, north, and west counterattacked at the same time, the enemy's forward troops immediately collapsed and retreated, and are now in a stalemate between Wuquan Road and Jungong Road. According to another report, last night and this morning, enemy aircraft and artillery attacked our army's positions from the Qiujiang Wharf, hoping to cover their infantry's advance. Our army fiercely flanked and counterattacked, causing heavy casualties to the enemy. Our army is now firmly defending [ ], and the eastern villages in the city center. The enemy has no strength to advance further.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that the enemy at Qiujiang Wharf landed by force on the 6th. After our army's fierce attack throughout the day yesterday, the enemy was forced to retreat to the Jungong Road area. Unexpectedly, a large number of enemy reinforcements landed and reinforced last night. Under the cover of enemy naval fire, with armored vehicles as the vanguard, they launched a fierce counterattack against us, with the aim of reaching the city center. Our army swept with dense machine guns and attacked the enemy with grenades. The fierce battle lasted until 11:00 PM. Finally, due to the intensity of the enemy's artillery fire and the rampant armored vehicles, our army, after heroic sacrifices, was pushed by the enemy's left wing to Wangjiazhai, and the right wing entered Wuquan Road. Then, before dawn this morning, our army's rear troops also arrived to reinforce, and joined forces to charge the enemy. A heroic melee began. Our army charged the enemy with bayonets fixed, and attacked the enemy with grenades. All firearms were useless at this point, relying only on flesh and blood to fight. The enemy was unable to cope with this, and the battle line was in chaos. Our loyal soldiers went across the enemy formation, killing enemies like flies. The enemy fled in panic, abandoning their weapons, and corpses filled the road. Although our army's bayonets were stained with blood, they still mustered the courage to pursue and attack. By about 8:00 AM today, our army had advanced to Jungong Road, and the enemy had retreated to the riverside, in a state of distress. The enemy in Yangshupu also attacked our Yinxiang Township at the same time last night, expecting to achieve the effect of a pincer attack with the enemy in Qiujiang Wharf. It was bravely repelled by our army, and the enemy did not succeed. Around 6:00 AM this morning, nine enemy aircraft bombed the racecourse area in Yinxiang Township for two hours before leaving. Then, around 8:00 AM and 12:00 AM, two enemy ships docked on the river north of Lujiazui opened fire and bombarded our Yinxiang Township, but our army suffered no damage.</p>
<p>According to military sources, the enemy is eager to open up communication between Yangshupu and Zhanghuabang Wenzaobang, and had to take a risk. A large number of infantry landed from Qiujiang Wharf, hoping to intercept our central route. On the 6th, starting from the morning, the enemy, numbering five or six thousand, under the cover of naval artillery and aircraft, fiercely attacked Yinxiang Township and Jiangwan. For a time, the momentum was huge. They were caught by our reinforcements who arrived and attacked from three sides. The enemy could not hold out and retreated to the Qiujiang Wharf area. Yesterday morning, the enemy reinforced and counterattacked again. The warships and fireboats stationed in the river attacked fiercely with dense artillery fire. The artillery fire did not stop all day, and once approached the city center. A large number of our reinforcements rushed up quickly, and the rear artillery also concentrated their attacks, encircling from three sides and attacking waist-high. The sound of guns and cannons was as dense as firecrackers. Our army bravely took the lead, advancing straight ahead. The enemy could not hold out and collapsed, with casualties all over the field and extremely heavy losses. By about 9:00 PM last night, the enemy had retreated to Qiujiang Wharf and entrenched themselves in the nearby houses. Our army is still advancing to the Jungong Road area, and is strictly defending.</p>
<h3>Our Baoshan Defenders Fight to the Death with the Enemy</h3>
<p>Our reinforcements have approached the city, and will attack together with the troops stationed inside the city.</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM yesterday, a battalion of ours who held Baoshan city to the death, sent a telegram from within the city by a certain regimental adjutant, stating that the entire battalion of officers and soldiers had been fighting the enemy to the death for days, suffering heavy casualties, but their morale was still extremely high. The entire city's population is also giving their support, so the enemy has never succeeded. At 6:00 PM, the telegram was cut off, and the situation inside the city is unknown.</p>
<p>According to reports from the front received by military organs, the enemy near Baoshan has suffered heavy casualties after being hit hard by an elite unit of our army, and was forced to retreat. Yesterday, they continued to reinforce and try to attack again. A battalion of our defenders inside Baoshan city has been defending the isolated city to the death, and has never slackened, even though the enemy has repeatedly bombed fiercely with aircraft and artillery, determined to defend the city to survive, and perish with the city. A certain unit of fresh troops outside the city, on the southeast side of the city, has approached the city, not far from the enemy, and will respond to the troops stationed inside the city, and the enemy will not succeed.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Luodian Yesterday</h3>
<p>Both sides suffered extremely heavy casualties. The enemy and us are confronting each other in the Jing River.</p>
<p>Confirmed information, the fighting in Luodian yesterday was extremely fierce on both sides. There were as many as six or seven close combat charges, lasting for several hours. Although there was no change in the position, the casualties on both sides were extremely heavy. When the two sides were mixed in bloody battle, a certain battalion of ours suddenly charged fiercely against the enemy at Changqiao from the line of [ ] House [ ] House. As of this morning, they are still confronting the enemy there near the Jing River. According to confirmed reports, the positions west of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, west of Shenjiawan Jiangzhai, have been recovered by our army. At that time, a unit of our army flanked the enemy at Shuangcaodun, and the enemy collapsed to the northeast. At the same time, our army dispatched another unit of fresh troops to attack towards the Chuansha River mouth. In this battle, the enemy suffered countless casualties.</p>
<h3>Enemy at Wusong and Baoshan Cut Off</h3>
<p>The remaining enemy at Zhanghuabang is surrounded by us. The north and south lines are also cut off in the same way.</p>
<p>Confirmed information, the total number of enemy troops along the river at Zhanghuabang, Wenzaobang, Wusong Town, and Paotaiwan is no less than 5,000. After being hit hard by our army, casualties are almost half of the numbers. But because the enemy's reinforcements have been increasing, the enemy is still stubbornly resisting. The enemy at Baoshan the other day, borrowed its support to come from Wusong. But our army was already prepared, and gave it a head-on attack. The enemy could not hold out, and retreated to the original Wusong route. Our army took advantage of the victory and pursued, straight until this morning. It was learned that the enemy between Wusong Town and Paotaiwan has been surrounded by our army and attacked from all sides. All the enemy's communication lines between Wusong and Baoshan have been cut off by us. At the same time, the remnants of the enemy along the river at Zhanghuabang Wenzaobang have also been surrounded by us before dawn this morning, and the enemy's communication lines on the north and south sides (north to Wusong, south to Hujiang University) have also been cut off in the same way, and are continuing to advance and pursue.</p>

The fighting was very fierce. The enemy once crossed Nanchitang, and at the same time, the enemy sent another unit to cross the river in two routes near Yantou Stone. Our front-line troops attacked separately, blocking their advance, and then reinforced with a large number of reinforcements from the rear, together with the original military strength, launched a large-scale counterattack, advancing with blood along the way, fighting fiercely for several hours.

<p>The various areas of Yangshupu are holding their original lines. There has been no movement in Liuhe since the enemy was repulsed.</p>
<p>The enemy in Zhabei has been disturbing many times. Our side has already seen through their trick and ignored it. When they thought they could take the opportunity to attack, our army waited for them to get too close and launched a painful attack. The enemy was caught off guard and suffered great setbacks many times. Last night, several armies used their old tricks again, and ultimately failed, suffering losses again. In addition, in the Yangshupu area, all parties held their original lines, with no changes. Since the enemy landing in Jihe was repulsed, there has been no movement yesterday or today.

<p>[Manila] As the Philippine Islands are in the process of achieving complete independence, the large-scale activities of the Japanese Navy in the South China Sea have caused anxiety among the people here, especially due to the news from Hong Kong that the Japanese Navy has occupied Dongsha Island. The "Manila Daily Bulletin," the only newspaper run by Americans on the Philippine Islands, stated that Japan's actions have shattered several ideals about the Philippines, one of which is that the Philippines, with a relatively small number of defensive forces, can make the country safe.

<p>[London] The Japanese government has sent a temporary response to the British government regarding the injury of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, but British authorities will not release their opinions until they have received the final response from the Japanese government. It is expected that the final response will not be delayed for too long. However, it is heard that if the temporary response is the final word from the Japanese government, then the British government will definitely not consider it satisfactory. (Central News Agency telegram, 8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] Today's editorial in the "Daily Herald" stated that Japan had a reputation in the past, but it has gradually lost it. It is difficult for the Japanese government to admit that its officers injured the ambassador of an allied country in another country for no reason. However, if it tries to escape the difficulty with false words, then it is like a cowardly act of committing a crime and making excuses. The possible answer is, "Sir, I didn't do it." This is truly the height of baseness and shamelessness. (Central News Agency telegram, 8th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Wang Zhengting Appeals to the United States Regarding Japanese Violent Aggression</h3>
<p>Based on Current International Treaties. China is Still Willing to Promote Peace</p>
<p>[New York] The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Wang Zhengting, has recently appealed to the American people to donate money to help the injured civilians in China. Ambassador Wang also released a statement to the newspapers stating that what Japan is doing now is implementing the plan outlined in the Tanaka Memorial in 1917, and wants to conquer the land occupied or controlled by Western countries in the Far East. He also said that if Japan now stops its aggression, then China can still submit the relationship between China and Japan for discussion, either through direct negotiations with Japan, or through the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague, or based on the Washington Nine-Power Treaty or the Paris Pact. Finally, he said that China has no reason to formally declare war on Japan. (Central News Agency telegram, 7th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Short Commentary</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Although China and Japan have not formally declared war, Japan has suddenly completely blockaded our country's coastline. This kind of illegal and tyrannical action is truly setting a bad precedent in international affairs.</p>
<p>Japan's purpose in blockading our country's coastline is nothing more than to cut off the supply of arms to our country from neighboring countries. In fact, our country had long anticipated this tactic, so we do not hope for assistance from any neighboring country. Our weapons are "the spirit of resistance," "brave and skilled soldiers," and "united enthusiasm." We will never rely on mechanized weapons to compete for victory or defeat.</p>
<p>However, the failure to punish the illegal inspection of merchant ships of various countries by the Japanese side is an act of tolerance that is below the waterline. Shanghai is an international market, and our country is originally a country with a trade deficit. Assuming that after the blockade, foreign merchant ships disappear, then our country will become self-sufficient and will not have a trade deficit. In that case, we should be grateful to the Japanese.</p>

<h3>Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent on the Zhabei Front</h3>
<p>En Route, Witnessing Enemy Armored Vehicles Seized by Our Forces; Our Superior Position with Fortifications as Solid as Gold</p>
<p>Our correspondent, under the guidance of a certain department director last night, inspected the Zhabei area battle lines and returned to the office at 3 AM this morning. Starting out, there was no way to drive directly to Zhabei. To avoid enemy mechanized activities, we groped forward with lights off. Everywhere, there were ruins and rubble, and even the threads of military communication lines were inconvenient for our troops. Several miles of buildings and businesses had miraculously survived the fierce street fighting of recent days, untouched. However, most were scorched earth, silent and lifeless, resembling an ancient city deserted by humanity. Approaching Baoshan Road, the sound of rifles and machine guns became audible, like linked pearls, intermittent and continuous. We bypassed a certain bridge and circled to a certain position. The stench of death assaulted the senses, and the desolation intensified. Since this line was taken by our forces, the enemy has never forgotten it, launching vengeful counterattacks, all of which failed. The night before, they even drove their elite mechanized troops to fiercely attack. Our troops responded calmly, crawling forward and seizing a leading armored vehicle. The enemy driver was wounded and abandoned the vehicle, fleeing. The rest also retreated. The enemy armored vehicle was then captured by our forces. Last night, it was towed to the rear. The correspondent happened to encounter it. It was heard that after minor repairs, it could be used as a weapon against the enemy again. The further forward we went, the narrower the road became, and the louder the sounds of battle cries, gunfire, and artillery. An officer smiled and said, "This must be the enemy delivering military supplies to the old place again." At that moment, the sound of bullets whizzed overhead. The car could no longer proceed, so we abandoned the vehicle and walked to meet a certain commander who was directing operations at the front. According to him, although fighting in the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas has been continuous recently, with occasional engagements and artillery exchanges, both sides' front lines have remained largely unchanged. This is because our positions are advantageous, and the fortifications are as solid as gold. If not advancing, we can hold firmly; if advancing, we are sure to gain something. Regarding the battle situation in Luodian and Wusong, our army is indeed in a very advantageous position. The Japanese army has suffered repeated setbacks and has frequently increased reinforcements. However, their elite Kurume Division has achieved little. As for the reinforcements, they will inevitably be worse than the previous ones. We still maintain the spirit of "do not be arrogant, do not be discouraged," and maintain a steady and solid approach, dealing with them for the long term. Do not be intimidated by empty threats. With that, we bid farewell and returned.</p>
<h3>No Peace Movement Underway in Any Quarter</h3>
<p>Mayor Yu Speaks to Newspaper Representatives: We Resist and Defend Ourselves Against Enemy Invasion</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that yesterday (the 6th), Mayor Yu, in his capacity as a spokesman for the Chinese army, spoke to representatives of various newspapers, saying that no efforts have been made by any party to bring about peace in Shanghai. Since the unfortunate injury of British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, there has been no sign of such a movement. One of the representatives asked under what conditions China would agree to resolve the overall situation. Mayor Yu declined to answer and stated that as long as the enemy troops invade Chinese territory for one day, China will resist for one day to defend itself. Mayor Yu also mentioned that the naval authorities of the United Kingdom, United States, and France had requested the Chinese army to withdraw from Pudong and the Japanese warships to move to the Gongping Road pier, saying that as of the afternoon of the 6th, he had not received instructions from the government. (Note by the reporter: Our official response was delivered yesterday (the 7th).)</p>
<h3>Observations of a European Military Expert on the Shanghai Battle</h3>
<p>Japan Mobilizes 100,000 Troops, Achieves Nothing; The Spirit of the Chinese Army is Rare Even in the European War</p>
<p>Yesterday, our correspondent and a friend visited a foreign military expert from an Allied country who participated in the European war to discuss the recent battles in Shanghai. The correspondent sincerely asked him to give a fair critique. The expert replied as follows: The re-ignition of the war in Shanghai has its root causes, and the motivations are clear. The various countries in the world have a clear understanding and fair and strict criticism of the situation. I need not elaborate. Based on my observations of the past twenty days of fighting, I cannot help but feel deep concern for Japan, and even more so, concern for the danger Japan is in.</p>
<p>First, speaking of Japan's military strength, it has only seventeen divisions of truly combat-effective regular army. Although its reserve troops are said to number in the millions, once they are actually mobilized, the results of their effectiveness on the battlefield will be disappointing. Those so-called reserve troops are not only burdened with wives and families, but are also wealthy merchants who are accustomed to a comfortable life. Now, if they are suddenly forced to leave their wives and children and engage in a war of aggression against another country with no hope of returning alive, it is not only impossible to expect them to win a decisive victory against a China that is awakening like a sleeping lion, but also fear that they will be unable to reach the battlefield. Now, the Shanghai battle has only been going on for twenty days, and the Japanese army has continuously increased its land forces to five divisions. Together with the number of naval landing forces, it has already exceeded 100,000. The fleet concentrated in a corner of Shanghai has reached over a hundred ships. However, the price it has paid is only prolonged bitter fighting in a limited area along the coast of Puxi, a huge consumption of military materials, and the return of a large number of dead soldiers and ashes, as well as provoking the resentment of countries around the world and facing severe economic crises. What is most surprising to people around the world is that every Chinese officer and soldier is determined to sacrifice himself for the country. Once the enemy arrives, they engage in bloody hand-to-hand combat. This kind of great spirit is rare even in the battles of the European War. Therefore, if Japan still regards today's China as the China of the Sino-Japanese War, it is a completely foolish plan. Even compared with the "January 28th" Incident, Japan has made a great mistake. In short, it is difficult for Japan to act deceitfully, but what can be done about China's determination to fight to the death?</p>
<h3>"Incidental" Military Exercise</h3>
<p>— Translated from the North-China Daily News</p>
<h3>The Significance of the National Resistance Against Japan as Seen by a Certain Military Commander and the National Agricultural and Medical Bureau</h3>
<p>Contributing to the Nation as a Whole with the Combined Human and Material Resources of the Entire Nation</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese conflict has the force of a full-scale war of resistance. The state of our military affairs is a matter of great concern to the general public. A reporter from Ta Kung Pao yesterday visited Professor Zhuang Zhongwen of Jiaotong University. (Note: Professor Zhuang has just returned from the front with a certain military commander in charge of important matters, and has come back to discuss important public affairs.) According to him, the morale of our front-line troops is high, and all are determined to sacrifice themselves. In contrast, the enemy troops lack morale, not only are their combat experiences far inferior to ours, but they are also timid in battle, which is the opposite of our army. At present, the enemy army is only relying on naval artillery and airplane bombs to barely support themselves, so although their firepower is fierce, they are still confined to one area. This is already a spiritual victory for us. If we persist in resisting, the final victory will undoubtedly belong to us. A certain military commander also has several suggestions for the people in the rear, and asked them to be conveyed to all circles, such as: First, today's war between our country and Japan is by no means an accidental or local conflict. The entire nation must understand the two meanings of this war of resistance. First, this war is a war between our oppressed nation and the invading bandits, that is, a war between our national revolution and imperialist countries. Therefore, the outbreak of this war, whether from the perspective of our nation's own resistance or from the perspective of the truth of human survival, has profound significance. Second, in terms of national strength, they are strong and we are weak; in terms of military strength, they are superior and we are inferior. In terms of the nature of the war, they are aggression and we are resistance. Therefore, all our soldiers must uphold the spirit of sacrifice and seek survival through death, and contribute to the country as a whole with the human and material resources of the entire nation. It is important to know that sacrifice is the foundation of success. Only by sacrificing to the greatest extent can we achieve the greatest success. If the enemy cannot gain an inch of our land, they have already failed in their purpose of waging war, and if we can persist in resisting, we have already gained the entire price of sacrifice. We should know that fighting against the Japanese pirates is to fight for final victory, not to fight for temporary gains and losses in one place. A temporary small victory or small defeat is not enough to worry about. Victory is not enough to be happy about, and failure is not enough to be sad about. It is like a running account book in a store. Even if there are occasional discrepancies in income and expenditure, the store's profit or loss cannot be based on the daily running account, but must be based on the annual final settlement. Therefore, what we seek is the final victory at the end of the war. In short, Japan's advantage lies in a quick decision, while our advantage lies in persistence. Therefore, we fully adopt a protracted war of attrition, dragging Japan until they are exhausted and unable to invade China any further, which is when China will finally achieve victory. Therefore, whether it is the army or the people, they should stand on the part of the success of the entire nation and country. All soldiers have the responsibility to lay the foundation for the prosperity of the country and the nation. Therefore, everyone should be proud of the glory of the nation and the country, and must not be complacent and boastful of the success of one person or one thing. The people should do work that is beneficial to the war. Those who are idle and take a bystander attitude towards the war are no different from helping the enemy. Even those who only do things that are not beneficial to the war are also no different from helping the enemy. We sincerely hope that all circles can do everything that is beneficial to the war to increase the combat efficiency of the army. As for directly comforting the army with materials, it is not what is desired. Although the kindness and enthusiasm of the general public are very touching, giving things without a plan to comfort the soldiers is equivalent to wasting national strength. In fact, the items received cannot be distributed by the officers, and the soldiers cannot use them. For example, if the public sends a hundred boxes of biscuits, it is not enough to distribute them to the majority of the soldiers, and it is not appropriate for the officers to keep them. This is not only ineffective in practice, but also makes it difficult for the officers. The other day, the people of Suzhou sent many Ding Sheng cakes to comfort the soldiers, but this kind of cake is not easy to preserve under the scorching sun of ninety degrees Fahrenheit, and the difficulty of distribution is the same as with other items. As a result, it is simply a waste of people's energy and money. Therefore, the method of comforting the soldiers by the people at present may be changed slightly, that is, to donate cash to the government, which will be distributed by the government. The government will take out a part of the donations from the people to benefit the families of the wounded and dead soldiers and the disabled officers and soldiers, so that they can receive subsidies and spiritual comfort in their lives. Isn't it more meaningful than directly comforting the army with materials? The above are all the opinions of a certain military commander in charge of the former front. Mr. Zhuang asked the reporter to introduce this idea to all circles of the public. The reporter also believes that the points pointed out by a certain commander are deeply practical, and hopes that in the future, in addition to the items that the front specifies need to be donated, the rest should be donated to the government in cash, so as not to waste unnecessary materials, which can increase the strength of our protracted war.</p>
<h3>Wartime Knowledge Training</h3>
<p>Actively Promote Office Affairs</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Wartime Knowledge Training Center organized by the city's Anti-Japanese Support Association, the number of lecturers and students has reached several thousand. Zhou Xianwen, Wu Xiu, Chen Gaoyong, and Li Paqi, the directors of the center, have recently been actively designing and promoting the program. In addition to continuing to hold the general training classes, the cadre class has been changed to an advanced class, with two hours of lessons per day, and the course will end in four weeks. All essential theoretical and practical knowledge about current affairs is available. The instructors are Guo Moruo, Wu Yugan, and Tong Xingbai, all of whom are top experts of the time. Every Sunday, Tao Baichuan, Shen Junru, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, and others are specially invited to lecture on various specialized topics. The third phase of registration has already begun the day before yesterday. The locations are No. 3, Cishu Lane, Yunnan Road; Guangxia Middle School, Muming Road; and the new city's Chinese Medicine College in the Huangjiasha Garden on Carter Road. It is also heard that the center has assigned Yang Kaifu, Shen Jiaolin, and Zeng San, three students from the first cadre class, to start registration work at Guangxia Middle School on Muming Road in order to assign work to the students in the first cadre class.</p>
<p>Da Guangming to Reopen Regularly</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, various Chinese and foreign theaters in the city have been suspended. It is now learned that the Da Guangming Theater, managed by the American-owned Guoguang Company, is scheduled to reopen on the 10th of this month. According to Mr. Butler, the manager of the company, the company has long-term film rental contracts with overseas film merchants, and many films have already arrived in Shanghai. Whether or not they are screened, the rent must be paid on time. The company has a total of more than one hundred employees. The losses from this prolonged suspension of business are huge, and the livelihood of the employees is difficult to maintain. Moreover, film is a noble art, so it is not purely entertainment, and it is very different from other entertainment businesses. During the European War, theaters, dramas, and other entertainment venues in various countries were never closed, which is a clear proof. Therefore, after careful consideration by the company, its Da Guangming Theater has decided to reopen on the 10th of this month. As for the Guoqin Theater, which is also run by the company, the repairs have not been completed, so the reopening will be postponed. It is also learned that a part of the Da Guangming and Guotai theaters are now rented to the Loan Committee run by the four banks of the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank as a temporary office, so it may not be delayed for the time being.</p>
