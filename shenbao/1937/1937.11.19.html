<h3>我軍全線轉趨穩定正儀大軍雲集足資固守</h3>
<p>嘉興七星橋以北有猛烈血戰　常熟轉危為安在大橫涇對峙　平湖乍浦我軍仍扼守原陣地</p>
<p>連日敵傾全力由嘉善犯我嘉興、經我軍奮勇應戰、敵退集七星橋及塘匯鎮一帶、復聯合王江涇附近之敵、分東北兩路包抄嘉興、砲火連天、戰况異常劇烈、刻仍在七星橋以北至南宮蕩一帶血戰中、至蘇嘉路方面、我軍在平望北面勝湖附近予敵重創、敵圖由此進窺吳江、壓迫蘇州、經我堵截、已不能越雷池一步、平湖乍浦方面、我仍扼守原陣地、至由崑山沿京滬綫西侵之敵軍、連日在洋澄湖南區與我軍發生遭遇戰、該處河浜縱橫、並有主力部隊拼死抵禦、足資久守、我增援大軍復源源開到、堅守大洋橋等處陣地、我正儀唯亭之綫、已趨穩固、今農本報接前方消息、昨日午後、敵整集部隊、藉飛機大砲坦克車之掩護、數度向我陣地衝犯、均經擊退、又敵艦數十艘集結耿涇口一帶江面、以猛烈砲火企圖掩護步隊登陸、犯我福山、我憑險固守、敵絕難得逞、刻尚在劇烈砲戰中、至常熟方面、敵前哨部隊確一度迫近城垣、經我猛烈反攻後、敵狼狽退却、現在常熟以東大橫涇北面地帶相持、總之、就蘇浙整個戰線形勢而言、我大軍陸續開到增援反攻後、確已日趨好轉、加以港汶紛岐之地形、實為我防禦綫之天然屛障、敵進犯必須犧牲較大之代價、可以斷言也、</p>
<p>中央社南京十八日路透電、茲據今日華方所得報吿、蘇州前綫狀况、在一星期混亂之後、今已見好轉、華軍在嘉善方面之右翼、最近形勢極為險惡、但因生力軍已開到、形勢亦已為之一變、</p>
<p>中央社蘇州十八日電、眞義一帶、敵以全力進犯、企圖突破襲擊唯亭、威脅蘇州以東陣地、連日戰事激烈、我軍奮勇應戰、現為利用天然屏障、已轉向陽城湖南一帶堅守、至嘉興方面、十八日下午、與外間仍尚通消息、可證仍在我軍手中、</p>
<p>中央社蘇州十八日電、敵永野片桐等部、由白茆口附近登陸後、與佐籐高橋等部續向滸浦以西一帶進犯、十七日晨、一度竄至福山城之一角、惟守城我軍沉着應戰、奮勇迎戰、當晚卽將竄敵擊退、現正乘騰追擊中、</p>
<h3>我大軍雲集崑山西線數達四十萬人</h3>
<p>前綫局勢一變敵已無法續進　蘇州轉危為安王江涇亦挽回</p>
<p>大陸報云、據前夜（十七日）中外人方面所得消息、日軍未能利用已往二十四小時中崑山西面華軍換防之機會、沿京滬路綫向蘇州進攻、加以近兩日中、大雨不止、使防守“興登堡陣綫”之華軍、得以從事鞏固其陣地、故日軍現已突然遭遇阻力、其在正儀之進攻、已吿停頓、華軍陣綫長約八十五哩、據外人估計、防守該陣綫之大軍、不下四十萬人、前在上海作戰之許多高級指揮、今皆在該陣綫親自督戰、該陣綫之戰事、昨日比較沉寂、日飛磯因天雨之故、未能活動、故華軍因此乃得鞏固其防線、正儀陣線之開到生力軍、使蘇州局勢為之一變、目前已可轉危為安、吳江王江涇之危局、亦經挽回、日軍佔據嘉善後、曾進至該兩地附近華軍大批援軍現已開入該區、自下正在激戰中、故日軍已無法續進、</p>
<h3>七星橋有劇戰</h3>
<p>據交通界消息、由嘉善沿鐵路綫進撲嘉興敵軍、被我擊退至七星橋及塘灣鎮一帶、經整理補充後、於前午起、復聯合王江涇附近之敵、分東北兩路、包抄嘉興、我軍亦分由滬杭蘇嘉兩綫、奮勇堵擊、刻在七星橋以北至南宮蕩一帶激戰、又平望方面之敵、前日、猛力向北衝擊、企圖進窺吳江、壓迫蘇州、以期截斷京、滬綫後路、我軍以蘇州爲國防綫上之要鎭、志在必守、刻在平望北面勝湖附近、予敵重大打擊、並已分途抄襲平望、故該處敵軍、現已頻陷絕境、</p>
<h3>嘉善西南昨有劇戰</h3>
<p>中央社南京十八日路透電、據此間所接消息、嘉善西南、現有劇戰、京滬路綫日軍、現向正儀攻擊、長江日艦、聞開砲轟擊福山一帶之華軍左翼、</p>
<h3>日少將在嘉善負傷</h3>

<h3>觀海衞敵未登陸</h3>
<p>旬前雙方激戰轟毀日艦二艘　敵機極活動登陸企圖難實現</p>
<p>餘姚旅滬同鄕會昨日接該縣同鄕來函、對於姚北近狀、述之基詳、茲摘錄如下、吾姚沿海湖地臨山、倪家路一帶、（離庵東市約二十里）自一星期以前、雙方用大砲飛機猛烈激戰、事後據傳我方轟沉日艦一艘、被潮水擱淺自行損壞者又一艘、近據確實消息、謂轟沉者均所目覩、自壞一艘、尚在疑信參半之中、最近幸尚無舉動、惟十·十一·十二·三日、敵機』城區上空飛繞不已、尤其在縣政府及中心小學上空低飛盤旋、惟並未投彈、然城中居民、已一日數驚矣、（逃至鄕間躱避者為數甚衆、）總之如東寗波、觀海衛·西杭州·曹娥·百官·北沿海一帶、能不被敵軍衝破上陸、當屬不幸中之大幸、再前昨兩日、敵因兵艦被吾軍轟沉、因之惱羞成怒、後海一帶、兵艦又到二十餘艘、我方軍隊、現正集中觀海衞、奮勇防禦、敵登陸企圖、一時殊難實現、</p>
<h3>福山砲隊及狼山守軍夾攻敵艦</h3>
<p>常熟近郊敵軍亦經我軍擊退　現在大橫涇北面地帶相持中</p>
<p>軍息、敵艦數十艘、集結先生橋鎮及耿涇口一帶江面、自前日起、不斷向我福山陣地猛轟、企圖登陸、我福山砲隊及對岸狼山守軍向敵艦夾攻、砲火激烈異常、敵軍頗有損傷、截至前日早晨止、雙方仍在砲戰中、我方現有重兵分佈王墅鎮至蕭家橋並沿福山塘一帶、憑堅固守、敵之陰謀、决難得逞又息、由支塘鎭方面分兩路進犯常熟之敵、約有兩聯隊之衆、一度曾被衝抵城外近郊、經我軍猛烈反攻後、敵不支而退、刻在常熟以東大橫涇北面地帶相持、</p>

<h3>漢奸流氓乘機活躍</h3>
<p>南市大火、將及一週、而在小西門內一帶、尚有餘燄未熄、惟南市在三月抗戰、本無軍事凖備、而日方除南車站一度轟炸後、近城一帶、素稱平靜、故居戶縱有暫時逃避租界、而動產什九未携、及至最後吃緊、而交通已斷、故內中實藏不少、自大火後、流氓與漢奸連通一氣、在該區內搶掠動產而在唐家灣等處公然拍賣、於是有一班客籍之痞棍、與當地流氓、均由租界設法至南市、先投順於漢奸處籍謀發財、鹹瓜街參燕行大火、流岷等於灰燼中取出人參兩箱、而豆麥行中豆麥等運出北市、已經脫售、惟日人對此輩投機之華人、並不信任、</p>

<p>中央社倫敦十八日路透電、今日每日電聞報之社論、對於遠東戰事稱、‘日本並未能如其所預期者、邁步前進、而中國軍備雖較劣、但並未阻撓顯示其奮勇之精神、至少不亞於日軍所有者、再則日本雖企圖以飛機之轟炸懾伏中國、但中國迄今猶無精神崩潰之徵象、中國之抵抗、非但顯示其英勇、且足令人感奮、蓋其所表示者、卽恐怖性質之狂妄行動、在此方亦正如在遠東之同為缺少效能也、’每日電聞報對於中日兩國當前之長期戰爭、極為抱憾、並覺兩國正在喘息之餘·聚精會神、以待第二次更永久性之肉搏、關於調解一事、該報謂、他國若不出而斡旋、則中國决無求和之餘地、而日本亦不能提出合理之條件云、該報復稱中國全國對於蔣委員長之擁護、可以證明中國不能為地理上之團結、但在他一方面、吾人所不得不疑問者、卽日本政治之中心點何在、或何人能授權開始交涉、以及對其戰爭之目的下一界說、’每日電聞報復詢問日本軍隊意旨之指使者為誰、並稱目前大本營之設立、至少應能規定其責任、並藉此而决定日本所願在中國進行之遠近、以及其‘在目前所願吞噬’土地之廣袤云、</p>
<p>中央社倫敦十八日路透電、孟却斯德指導報今日評論日本組織大本營及日議會中、决撥款運動增進日本之精神事、謂無論日軍將獲何種勝利、日本之民衆、定將代付重價、而日本經濟生命之平衡、亦必受嚴重永久之打擊云、新聞紀事報、對於蔣委員長則極為稱頌、稱中國之抗戰、已引起世界之驚佩、更因政府中、最高當局之努力、益見堅强有力云、白明罕郵報則謂日本之勝利、若在一年之前、或可使南京奔逃、但在今日則其效力反使抵抗益見堅强云、至國都之遷移、亦卽不屈不撓之表示、而非敗退之承認、</p>

<h3>“怎樣纔能持久”</h3>
<p>汪主席昨晚廣播講演</p>
<p>［南京］汪主席應金陵廣播電台之請、十八日晚八時至八時一刻、在該台作播音講演、題為“怎樣纔能持久”、指示國人以長期抗戰方法、原詞如次、</p>
<p>此次抗戰、我們為須牢牢記着、能犧牲纔能持久、能持久纔能得最後之勝利、淞滬抗戰互二月之久、以無數精兵良將之血肉、築成壕壘、來抵禦敵人海陸空軍聯合之轟擊、未奉命令、有死無退、這種犧牲、在戰史中實為空前壯烈、有了這種犧牲精神、來做抗戰的基礎、可以進而研究怎樣纔能持久了、當蘆溝橋事變發生之始敵人誤為我們前此之着着忍讓、為恐懼、為懦怯、誤以為對於中國的一切、可以不勞而獲、及至遇着我們堅决的抵抗、於是向者以為可以垂手而得者、乃下得不變而為焦頭爛額然後得之了、三月以來、冀察綏并相繼淪陷、而淞滬之軍、亦被追後撤、敵人又誤以為戰車於此可以吿一段落、將坐而待中國之屈服、及至看見我們不屈不撓、再接再厲的態度、於是又不得不橫着一不做二不休的念頭、以進攻到底、來答覆我們的抗戰到底了、照着敵人近來的舉動、及其官傳欲望之大、將盡佔領我們沿江的都市、自吳淞以至宜昌、每一都巿都駐紥重兵、都製造傀儡、以飛機及長江船隊為聯絡、吳頭楚尾、連成一氣、然後以其餘力、慢慢的深入內地、將我們東南半壁、一塊塊的碎割下來、無論敵人是否做得到、而其要這樣的做、是無疑的、然則我們怎樣呢、詳細的說、將怎樣才能持久呢、這是目前大家應該研究淸楚、並且準備停當的、能持入與否、取决於戰鬥能力之能否保存及擴大、而戰鬥能力之能否保存及擴大、除了軍事之外、還有以下的三樣大事、第一是經濟、最近數十年來、中國的繁榮、慢慢的移至沿江沿海一帶、這是人所共見的事實、以這樣幼稚的工商業、來做現代戰爭的基礎、已嫌薄弱、如果沿江沿海一旦失去、則以內地凋零疲敝的農業手工業、來做現代戰爭的基礎、其為薄弱、更不待言、所以我們在經濟方面、應該以十二分的努力來加以維持、並謀其發達、不但沿江沿海必須盡其可能、使之勿失、而於內地、尤當深切研究其凋零疲敝之來源、從來說得好、“都巿如花鄕村如根”根不茂、則花之繁榮、不過一時現象、必須茂其根、然後開花結實、繁榮無盡、我們如果能於此努力、集中人力物力、以從事經營、對於農業手工業、加以培養、對於工商業、則以創造的精神、積極的建樹起來、這不但可以塞都市之漏　、並可使內地鄕村、進於普遍的繁榮之境、這是我們應該以十二分的努力期其實現的第一樁大事、等二是交通、近來時時聞人提及所謂流動戰、這是屬於軍事、且不必說、惟有不可不注意的、使用流動戰、在環境上最適宜的、是交通不便、或為沙漠不毛、或為山嶺重壘、或為河流錯雜、使之陸不便車、水不便兵、斷絕之處、不便橋樑、然後流動戰稍能發揚其效果、證之剿匪時代、當公路未開之時、此追彼竄、一方疲於奔命、一方飄忽無常、及至公路旣開、則前此如一隻蒼蠅、可在室中飛來飛去者、至此便難逃掌握了、數年以來、公路網已吿完成、善用之則以便於我之交通、不善用之則反以資敵、所以我們在交通方面、應該以十二分的努力、加以控制、務使我們以無數血汗築成的公路、祇若為我用、不能為敵用、並且要村村自保、家家自衛、挖的壕溝、越多越好、築的堡壘、越多越好、務必使敵人頭頭都是碰壁、步步都是荊棘、如俗語所說的“咬骨頭咬斷了自己的牙齒、”那麼只怕他不深入、深入之後、非留下這條命不能回去、這是我們應該以十二分的努力期其實現的第二樁大事、第三是民衆、三百年前、滿洲以五百萬人之富、而宰制我們四萬萬人之衆、其惟一秘訣、是以中國的錢、養中國的兵、來殺中國的人、近來敵人每到一處、便急急忙忙組織傀儡政府、卽是偸此秘訣、為其藍本、我們如果不以十二分的努力喚起民衆、則此種浩刦、决無可逃、頗聞有人說道、“為什麼這次抗戰、反不如北伐時之處處看見民衆大會呢、”欲解答這個疑問、與其說是戰况不同、毋寗說是意義不同、北伐的意義、重任在政治、故熱烈宣傳、最為必要、此次抗戰、是為國家民族之生存而奮鬥、其意義是人人知道的、故沉着工作、較之熱烈宣傳、更為重要、鄕村的民衆、在全國中佔最多數、亦最有力、平日省吃儉用、勤勞不息、以事生產、看似無知無識、實則一片天良、抗戰以來、除了前方將士在戰壕中勇猛抗敵之外、鄕村的民衆、在後方担任種種勞苦的工作、遠非在都巿中只喝高調、不負責任者所可比擬、可惜那些只喝高調不負責任的人、只曉得民衆大會、不看見民衆的埋頭工作、所以會發此疑問、這不值得一辯、我們對於這些最多數的民衆、第一要努力上述的經濟條件、以充實其生活與能力、第二要努力上述的交通條件、以保障其安全與活動、第三還要加以組織、加以訓練、以加强其戰鬥能力、那麼不但傀儡無從發生、卽使發生、亦將隨牽綫者以同為灰燼、這是我們應該以十二分的努力期其實現的第三樁大事、以上三樁大事、我們必要努力做到、此次抗戰、纔能持久、纔能由持久而得到最後之勝利、（十八日中央社電）</p>

<h3>工部局發給私校補助費辦法</h3>
<p>業經董事會通過</p>
<p>工部局敎育委員會本月五日開會時、曾將界內華人私立舉校本年度第三期私校補助費問題、提出考慮、據工部局衛生處報吿、中區及西區內現有受補助費之私校一百二十七所、其中五十八校業經認爲成績圓滿、應准具領補助費、四校已遵照衛生處之指示、着手改良、兩校原校址、因改充難民醫院、已遷至臨時校址上課、其情况亦經暫認爲滿意、均應准具領、其餘六十三校、或尚未遵本局意旨改良設備、或早已遷移、或確已停辦、其應享之補助費均停發、東北兩區在戰事發生前、原有八十八校、其中十校、在戰前曾經視察、認爲滿意、現在或已遷地開學、或已籌備開學、或已將其學生送至其他受補助費之私校借讀、各該學校、如非因戰事關係、均得領補助費、因此第三期補助費、仍應照發、</p>
<p>消息不明者共有二十一校、確知已停辦者共有六校、各該校在本年八月十三日以前、就其原校址之情况而言、均得領受補助費、此二十七校連同另外已在戰前着手改良衛生設備、而現在消息不明之五校、是否應准具領補助費、當予特別考慮、此外尚有九校、其原校舍在戰前雖不盡善、惟現已另覓校址開學、而新校舍尚稱滿意、因之敎育委員會不妨准其領受補助費、東北兩區內之其餘三十七校、未曾遵守本局所開條件改良、應不准具領、</p>
<p>工部局財務處長就補助費問題提出意見、該處長謂在通常情况之下、各校之設備等、必須適合本局各處所定條件、且須於九月初開學、屆時學生人數須與春季人數實際上相同、方得領受第三期補助費、關於人數一節雖不妨酌量通融、惟不能完全置之不問、設任何一校在九月底以前全部開學、其學生人數在春季人數之三分之二以上、則第三期補助費應予照給、如秋季人數不及春季人數之三分之二、則補助費應接比例减少、如上課時間僅有半日者、補助費亦應减發、</p>
<p>敎育委員會各委員審閱上開報告及意見書以後、對於領受補助費之條件、尤其關於上課學生人數及半日上課制兩節、詳細討論、據該委員會所悉、界內各華童小學上課人數、約合平時人數之四分之一、中學上課人數約合百分之六十、而各西僑學校學生、十一月一日到校人數約合三分之一、又悉受補助費各校學費、已於戰事發生後、减收一半、該委員會討論以後、議决向董事會提出下列建議、㊀凡華童學校、已在可稱滿意之校舍開學、其學生人數在從前人數一半以上、無論上課時間多少、除其敎學設備顯然不完善者外、擬准具領本年度第三期補助費之全部、㊁凡在可稱滿意之校舍開學、而其到校學生人數不及平時之一半者、擬准具領半數補助費、㊂其他各校、如戰事不延長、已可合於領受本年度第一二兩期全部或一部補助費之資格、而未克領受者、現在是否發給、擬在本局各處向本委員會下屆會議提出報吿以後、就各校情形、分別攷量、</p>
<p>上開建議、經工部局董事會於本月十七日開會通過採納、</p>

<h3>英德外交談話</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>英樞相哈立法克斯和德元首希特勒將於今日在柏林舉行重要的外交談話。據聞所要討論的問題範圍很廣。如反共公約及西歐公約等都在其列。而近日德國報紙且散布收回舊德屬殖民地的空氣。似乎這一問題也將提出討論。這次外交談話。不但表示着英德兩國正在作改善國交的努力。而其性質又關繫着全世界的局勢。這不消說是値得深切注意的。</p>
<p>誰都知道。英帝國的一貫政策是要維持世界的均勢。戰後德國的勃興得力於英國的扶助很大。近幾年來。德意兩國積極地向外擴張着勢力。歐局因而動搖。英國便又不得不跟法國有進一步的結合了。可是英國這種政策非但不能維持世界的安定。反而使國際局勢愈益於自國不利。現在歐洲方面意大利一意要阻撓英國在地中海的霸權。遠東方面日本一意要侵奪英國在中國的權益。已經很明顯了。反共公約的成立使日意兩國更其增張了氣燄。在這樣的局勢之下。英國政府想到再拉攏德國是不足驚異的。這次英樞相柏林之行。照我的猜想。其主要作用大約是要以對德的若干讓步換取安定世界局勢的保證罷。因爲德意日三國之間并不是沒有矛盾存在着。意日要是得不到德國的支持。闖禍的力量也就大大地减弱了。雖然如此德國的慾望究竟是不容易滿足的。英國在這次外交談話要獲得多大的成就。恐怕還困難得很呢。</p>

<p>連日前綫戰事、仍極猛烈、尤以嘉興方面、敵傾全力進犯、我軍拚死抵禦、屢進屢退、雙方損失奇重、京滬路一綫、正儀唯亭之間、我方利用天然形勢、倚水設防、頗佔優勢、敵雖有機械化部隊、因天雨泥濘、頗難活動、我軍旣得天時地利之助、於抗戰前途、自有把握、據今午所得戰况、報告如下、㊀福山江面、敵艦密佈、多至六七十艘、向岸不絕開砲、側擊我左翼常熱陣地、王江涇附近戰事吃緊、經敵猛轟多日、工事被燬、我軍有退至洋澄湖南區之消息、㊁洋澄湖南區我軍憑險扼守、且兵力雄厚、不虞有他、某高級將領、昨日親臨戰地督戰、士氣為之大振、㊂敵軍主力、日前曾迫近吳江、我方自得有力部隊增援、猛力反攻、業已解圍、㊃外傳嘉興吃緊、惟據某方消息、我重兵仍扼守城之東南兩面、奮勇抗拒、應援大軍、亦陸續開到、大戰開始在卽、敵决難得逞、</p>
<h3>嘉興附近劇戰我駐有重兵堪以保衛</h3>
<p>軍息、連日敵傾全力犯我嘉興甚亟、但經我軍奮勇截擊後、旣退至七里橋及塘灣鎭一帶、與我軍相持、現敵正聯合王江涇方面之軍隊、擬包抄嘉興後路、一面又沿蘇嘉路圖犯吳江、但經我軍抄擊平望後、該路敵軍似已受重大損失、頃嘉興附近混戰、異常劇烈、惟該處我駐有重兵、堪資久守、敵縱有企圖、亦非付鉅大代價不可、</p>
<p>華東社云、嘉興方面、敝擬從海藍·海寗·抄後路計劃失敗後、屢次由嘉善“我嘉興正面、又圖由平望·王江涇、據嘉興之東側、經我×××師以引進式將敵激殺、敵斥候隊陷我重圍、完全消滅、其騎兵隊數度沿鐵路綫攻擊、終未得逞、</p>

<h3>停泊蘇州河民船悉被敵方强徵使用</h3>
<p>計二百餘艘船戶均逃避　一空目的在運輸軍火及搭架浮橋</p>
<p>停泊蘇州河之民營船雙、自經內地儎、貨運滬銷售後、因閘北我駐軍、突然奉令撤退、故該民船不及駛出、被圍在內、計達二百餘艘、河內軸轤林立、桅舷相望、擠塞不通、後經工部局設法排擋停靠、其中流業已通行無阻、惟每日來往者完全為敵軍之運輸小汽艇及徵用之駁船、溯江上駛、接濟軍需、茲據本公社記者探悉、敵方因自戰綫延長後、接援頻繁、但內地河流縱橫、河水低淺、深威運輸困難、故將停泊自外白波橋起至泥域橋止蘇州河內之民船小輪等二百餘雙、悉被强徵使用、現敵軍已於昨晚駛入小艇兩艘、士兵十餘名、將所有船雙之船牌·號碼·及儎重數量抄錄、以備使用、現各船戶紛紛均將行李物件搬至岸上、船主夥逃避一空、不願受敵驅使、但敵方强徵民船之目的、除運輸軍用品接濟前方外、其企圖復將民船搭架浮橋、作偸渡之用也、</p>
<h3>敵艦運來軍火糧食</h3>

<p>英上院繼續辯論外交　吉田大使晤艾登長談</p>
<p>［巴黎］外長台爾博斯今午出席衆議院外交委員會、報告國際情勢、台氏對比京會議報告甚詳、並於法國對遠東衝突之態度、亦有所說明、台氏宣稱、關於建議將遠東衝突之解决、交由國聯處理一層、渠不表贊同、渠堅持此事之調整、仍須由召開比京會議之九國公約簽字國負責進行、（十八日海通電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英上院今日復作外交事件之辯論時、前大法官桑凱與前保守黨總裁史頓海文、皆主張刪除國聯盟約第十六條、（卽關於制裁者）工黨白克斯登並主張對於恢復德國舊有殖民地一事予以讓步、謂苟承認此原則、則時局整理問題旣可自由討論、德人深知舊屬東非殖民地唐甘葉加境之困難、渠以為德人對於西非屬望較般云、航空大臣史溫頓代表政府答稱、現所需要者、為沈着之討論、若國會請求政府對於英國政策與手續加以詳細說明、此殊無補於獲取全部解决之目的、樞密大臣哈立法克斯乃極能傳達奐人思想者、但渠深望國人對其柏林之行、勿作奢望、如任意發表言論、則適舉談判有害云、（中央社十八日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］吉田駐英大使、十七日午後訪問艾登外相、談論重要問題約一小時、其會談之內容、雖未發表、但要求對於九國會議之情報、則由吉田大使則謂現今鑑於會議之轉機、今後英國不至蹈入其他方向、日本對華之决心、與今後方針等、更有詳細說明、以糾正其認識、艾登外相對於上項說明、似已開陳各種疑賓與夫希望、對於中國情勢之一大轉機、其談論之意義甚深、蓋英國政府對於比京會議如何不失面目、善為結束、似亦頗具苦心、美國代表台維斯恐美國國內為孤立所迷惑、在休會中避免專往倫敦、僅派遣隨員而已、是以今後會議多所期待之情形甚少云、（十七日同盟社電）</p>

<h3>美孤立派又趨活躍</h3>
<p>［華盛頓］近自國會復會以還、孤立派人士又復趨於活躍、此於參議員拉佛賴脫（威斯康率州議員、屬於進步黨）與嘉柏（堪薩斯州議員屬於共和黨、）二人聯名提出議案、主張修改憲法、俾宣戰一舉、須由人民投票加以决定一事、可以見之、在該派人士之意、以為美國參加九國公約會議之後、業已受有束縛、此項會議、現旣失敗、今後若果决定對於日本採取强制性質之行動、美國卽不免被迫參加其事也、按孤立主張、其遠因當於歐戰時求之、美國多數人士現仍認為美國參戰、係因恊商各國之慫恿、並受本國財閥之壓迫所致、實乃鑄成大錯、美國中等階級並對於歐洲時局、曁各項國際問題、均以猜疑態度處之、此外白宮與國會間對於國是、互爭决策之權一項情事、亦時時有之、此乃孤立派騷擾之近因、在此種情形之下、國務院感覺困難、其對於各項國際問題、應付之際、定必愈益審愼、自可斷言、大抵孤立派活動若賡續不止、則羅斯福總統或當就外交政策、再度發表宣言加以闡明、亦未可必、（中央社十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［柏林］關於哈立法克斯勛爵此行聘德之政治重要性、此間各報仍持愼默態度、不作評論、僅有“國社新聞報”申稱、二十五年之誤解、非一次簡單談話所能譯釋、故哈氏此行、僅為兩國關係向上之起始、或覓為一失敗云、（十八日海通電）</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>本刊出版以來。已逾三月。自經南市我軍撤退後。對於採集戰事消息。頗感困難。本報夕刊。本係臨時性質。亦為戰報性質。現在戰綫已延長至洋澄湖嘉興等處。戰綫綿亘三百餘里局勢之展開。已非淞滬局部戰事可比。而戰事之眞實消息。一時又未易採訪。不得不暫告一段落。一俟他日局勢轉變。仍能繼續行使採訪新聞之職責時。再當與讀者共見也。回憶在此三月抗戰之中。我國忠勇將士之浴血戰績。與民族意識之澈底覺悟。不可謂非我民族史上偉大之一頁。現在淞滬戰事。雖告一段落。而我國政府。向後移動。預備長期抗戰。堅决抗戰。則第二步戰略的展開。更必有驚人之表演。當與讀者拭目以俟之也。</p>

<h3>假裝老嫗</h3>
<p>— 劉育材</p>
<p>浦東我軍抗戰，不讓敵人偸渡上岸，已在我們心目中了。現在我軍忍痛撤退了，大家沉悶中，覺得有一件智勇的故事，值得報吿讀者的。</p>
<p>在大多數民衆看來，以爲浦東，我軍有十分雄厚的兵力駐守着，所以始終未曾被敵突破，事實上也不盡然，我所知道的浦東所以能如此堅守而不讓敵人得逞的緣故，却完全是在軍民恊力的防禦之下所奏的效果，我們担任浦東方面工作的民衆，他們各方面都能恊助軍隊的不足，有許多艱巨的事情，他們都能够負責完成，在這種軍民一致抗戰的步驟上，而始終保衛了浦東的安全，現在的撤退，當然不是敗退，而是戰略上有計劃的退却；</p>
<p>當我軍堅守在浦東一帶的時候，一天，我因工作的需要去浦東，在爛泥渡街碰見一個郵差，他吿訴我下面親自目覩的一段智勇殺敵的故事，當這故事的開端，並不希奇，是在浦東沿爛泥碼頭附近的煤堆地方，却說一天的下午有一個年已半老的鄕婦，兩手收縮在布服的下披裏面，傴僂着沒精打睬在沿浦的煤堆旁在來徘徊，那時候適有一隻潛水汽艇駛到煤堆的岸堤停了下來，同時後面陸逐的有數十隻大小不一的潛艇，也繼之停靠到這裏来，那第一隻潛艇裏因爲最先停靠，所以先有二三名日兵上了岸，日兵上岸時當然在四面張望了好久才實行的，只見四面寂寥，萬賴俱息，僅有一個年已半老的鄕婦，似痴若呆的在那煤堆附近踱步，一個日兵上前去，和那個鄕婦打話，他說：“你們中國軍隊還有嗎？”鄕婦答說：“已統統走了”那個日兵僅僅這一句問答之後，他卽右手一揮，只見所有數十隻潛水汽艇的日兵陸逐地上岸，正在這個時候，而那個鄕婦日兵也不顧到她，她也不需要再站在那裏，她就回到了近在咫尺的煤棧的籬笆裏，也打了一手勢，她自己却按凖了機槍，只見日兵已三分之二上了岸時，她卽開始密集的掃射了，可憐不知中計的日兵，隨全軍覆沒，一個都未曾生還·郵差對我表白地說：原來那個鄕婦，就是我軍化裝的誘敵工作啊；因之日軍的偸渡或强渡，我軍有許多次是不聲不響地讓他們上岸後，再行殲滅他；在洋涇鎮一帶，這樣的事，曾經十餘次之多，而每次都成功了，一個都沒有生還，所以後來之敵，他們始終不知道他們先死者的死法，而自己也繼續不斷的斷送上去了。</p>

<h3>Our Troops are Generally Stabilizing; Righteous Armies Gather, Sufficient to Defend</h3>
<p>Fierce Bloody Battle North of Qixing Bridge in Jiaxing; Changshu Turns from Danger to Safety, Confronting at Dahengjing; Our Troops in Pinghu and Zhapu Still Guard Original Positions</p>
<p>For days, the enemy has been exerting all its strength to invade Jiaxing from Jiashan. After our troops bravely fought back, the enemy retreated and gathered in the Qixing Bridge and Tanghui Town area, and then joined forces with the enemy near Wangjiangjing, encircling Jiaxing from the northeast in two routes. The artillery fire was continuous, and the battle situation was extremely fierce. Currently, fierce battles are still ongoing in the area north of Qixing Bridge to Nangongdang. As for the Sujia Road area, our troops inflicted heavy losses on the enemy near Shenghu north of Pingwang. The enemy attempted to take the opportunity to invade Wujiang and pressure Suzhou. After our interception, they have been unable to cross the Lei Pool even a step. In the Pinghu and Zhapu area, we are still guarding the original positions. As for the enemy forces invading westward along the Jinghu Line from Kunshan, they have engaged in encounters with our troops in the southern area of Yangcheng Lake for days. The area is crisscrossed by rivers and streams, and the main forces are desperately resisting, sufficient to defend for a long time. Our reinforcements are continuously arriving, firmly defending positions such as Dayang Bridge. Our Zhengyi-Weiting line has become stable. According to news received by this newspaper from the front yesterday afternoon, the enemy gathered its troops, using the cover of airplanes, artillery, and tanks, and charged our positions several times, but were all repelled. Furthermore, dozens of enemy warships gathered on the river surface in the Gengjingkou area, attempting to cover the landing of infantry with fierce artillery fire, invading our Fushan. We are firmly defending the dangerous terrain, and the enemy will definitely not succeed. Intense artillery battles are still ongoing. As for the Changshu area, the enemy's advance troops did once approach the city walls. After our fierce counterattack, the enemy retreated in disarray and is now confronting our forces in the area north of Dahengjing, east of Changshu. In short, in terms of the overall situation of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang battle line, after our large army successively arrived to reinforce and counterattack, the situation has indeed been improving day by day. In addition, the terrain of the port of Wenfenqi is a natural barrier for our defense line, and the enemy's invasion must be at a significant cost. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>Reuters, Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to reports obtained by the Chinese side today, the situation on the Suzhou front, after a week of chaos, is now improving. The right wing of the Chinese army in the Jiashan area has recently been in an extremely dangerous situation, but because fresh troops have arrived, the situation has also changed.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Suzhou, 18th - In the Zhengyi area, the enemy is attacking with all its strength, attempting to break through and attack Weiting, threatening the positions east of Suzhou. Fierce battles have been ongoing for days. Our troops are bravely fighting back. Now, in order to utilize the natural barriers, we have shifted towards the Yangcheng Lake area to firmly defend. As for the Jiaxing area, messages were still being communicated with the outside world on the afternoon of the 18th, which proves that it is still in the hands of our troops.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Suzhou, 18th - After the enemy's Nagano and Katagiri units landed near Baimao Kou, they continued to invade the area west of Hupu with the Sato and Takahashi units. On the morning of the 17th, they once sneaked into a corner of Fushan City, but our troops defending the city calmly fought back and bravely resisted. That night, they repelled the sneaking enemy and are now pursuing them in hot pursuit.</p>
<h3>Our Large Army Gathers on the Kunshan West Line, Reaching 400,000</h3>
<p>The Situation on the Front Changes, the Enemy is Unable to Continue Advancing; Suzhou Turns from Danger to Safety, Wangjiangjing Also Recovered</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that, according to news obtained from Chinese and foreign sources last night (the 17th), the Japanese army failed to take advantage of the opportunity of the Chinese army's troop rotation west of Kunshan in the past 24 hours to attack Suzhou along the Jinghu Railway Line. In addition, heavy rain has been continuous for the past two days, allowing the Chinese army defending the "Hindenburg Line" to consolidate its positions. Therefore, the Japanese army has now suddenly encountered resistance, and its advance in Zhengyi has come to a halt. The Chinese army's front line is about 85 miles long. According to foreign estimates, the large army defending this front line is no less than 400,000. Many senior commanders who previously fought in Shanghai are now personally supervising the battle on this front line. The war on this front line was relatively quiet yesterday. Japanese aircraft were unable to operate due to the rain, so the Chinese army was able to consolidate its defense line. The arrival of fresh troops on the Zhengyi front line has changed the situation in Suzhou. It is now possible to turn danger into safety, and the critical situation in Wangjiangjing, Wujiang, has also been recovered. After the Japanese army occupied Jiashan, they advanced to the vicinity of these two places. A large number of Chinese reinforcements have now entered the area, and fierce battles are ongoing. Therefore, the Japanese army has been unable to continue advancing.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle at Qixing Bridge</h3>
<p>According to sources in the transportation sector, the enemy forces advancing towards Jiaxing along the railway line from Jiashan were repelled by our forces to the Qixing Bridge and Tangwan Town area. After reorganizing and replenishing, they joined forces with the enemy near Wangjiangjing on the morning before yesterday, encircling Jiaxing from the northeast in two routes. Our troops also divided and bravely intercepted from the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Suzhou-Jiaxing lines. Fierce battles are currently ongoing in the area north of Qixing Bridge to Nangongdang. In addition, the enemy in the Pingwang area launched a fierce attack northward the day before yesterday, attempting to invade Wujiang and pressure Suzhou, in order to cut off the rear route of the Jing-Hu Line. Our troops, considering Suzhou to be a key town on the national defense line, are determined to defend it. They are currently inflicting heavy blows on the enemy near Shenghu north of Pingwang and have also divided their forces to raid Pingwang, so the enemy forces there are now frequently facing desperate situations.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Southwest of Jiashan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reuters, Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to news received here, there is currently a fierce battle southwest of Jiashan. The Japanese army on the Jinghu Line is currently attacking Zhengyi. It is heard that Japanese warships in the Yangtze River are shelling the left wing of the Chinese army in the Fushan area.</p>
<h3>Japanese Major General Wounded in Jiashan</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to today's Army Public Bulletin, Army Major General Tezukayama Shozo was wounded near Jiashan on November 8th.</p>
<h3>Enemy Has Not Landed at Guanhaiwei</h3>
<p>Fierce Battle Between Both Sides Ten Days Ago Destroyed Two Japanese Warships; Enemy Aircraft Very Active, Landing Attempts Difficult to Realize</p>
<p>The Yuyao Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai received a letter from fellow townsmen in the county yesterday, describing the recent situation in northern Yuyao in detail. The following is an excerpt: The coastal lake area of Yuyao, near the mountains, and the Nijiia Road area (about 20 miles from Andong City) have been the scene of fierce battles between the two sides using artillery and aircraft since a week ago. It was later rumored that our side had sunk a Japanese warship, and another was stranded and damaged by the tide. According to reliable sources, the sinking was witnessed by all, while the damage to the other is still being doubted. Fortunately, there have been no actions recently. However, on the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th, enemy aircraft repeatedly flew around the city, especially flying low and circling over the county government and the central primary school. However, they did not drop bombs, but the residents of the city have been startled several times a day (a large number of people have fled to the countryside to hide). In short, if Dong Ningbo, Guanhaiwei, Western Hangzhou, Cao'e, Baiguan, and the northern coast are not broken through and landed by the enemy army, it would be the best of luck in misfortune. Furthermore, due to the sinking of warships by our army in the past two days, the enemy has become angry and has sent more than 20 warships to the rear sea. Our troops are now concentrated in Guanhaiwei, bravely defending. The enemy's landing attempts are difficult to realize for the time being.</p>
<h3>Fushan Artillery and Langshan Garrison Jointly Attack Enemy Warships</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops in the Suburbs of Changshu Also Repelled by Our Troops; Currently Holding Position in the Area North of Dahengjing</p>
<p>Military News: Dozens of enemy warships gathered on the river surface in the area of Xiansheng Bridge Town and Gengjingkou, and have been continuously shelling our Fushan positions since the day before yesterday, attempting to land. Our Fushan artillery and the Langshan garrison on the opposite bank jointly attacked the enemy warships, and the artillery fire was extremely fierce. The enemy army suffered considerable damage. As of the morning of the day before yesterday, both sides were still engaged in artillery battles. Our side now has heavy troops distributed from Wangshu Town to Xiaojia Bridge and along the Fushan Pond, firmly defending. The enemy's conspiracy will definitely not succeed. Also, news: The enemy, which invaded Changshu from the Zhitang Town area in two routes, numbered about two regiments. They were once pushed to the outskirts of the city, but after our army's fierce counterattack, the enemy could not withstand it and retreated, and is currently holding a position in the area north of Dahengjing, east of Changshu.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships in the Huangpu River Suddenly Decreased Yesterday</h3>
<p>Frequent Military Transport in the South Huangpu and Suzhou Creek</p>
<p>The number of enemy warships in the Huangpu River suddenly decreased again yesterday. According to investigations, apart from 20 transport ships, there are only 5 gunboats remaining, anchored at Mitsubishi Wharf, New Mitsui Wharf, and South Huangpu. Four destroyers are anchored at Buoy No. 44, No. 40, Buoy No. 1, and Jinliyuan Wharf. One torpedo boat (anchored at China Merchants Bureau Huazhan) and one ironclad ship are anchored at Buoy No. 8. The Izumo flagship is anchored at Buoy No. 2. In total, there are 12 ships. It is said that most of the enemy warships have sailed to the river area near Changshu and Jiangyin, with intentions against us.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening at 5:30, an enemy transport ship (converted from a commercial transport) towed an iron barge, both loaded with ammunition and many soldiers, and with two tanks, sailed past the 16th Pier blockade in the dim twilight, heading straight for South Huangpu, apparently to reinforce the Minhang area.</p>
<p>In Suzhou Creek, at around 11:00 a.m. yesterday, two enemy military steamships, each carrying 30 to 40 Japanese and puppet soldiers, passed the New Garbage Bridge and went westward upstream. Shortly after, at 12:40 p.m., two small sampans, also fully loaded with Japanese and puppet soldiers, passed the New Garbage Bridge and went eastward quickly. The two sampans were closely connected, towed by a small motorboat. Overall, the situation of comings and goings can be described as frequent.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Continue to Transport Large Quantities of Military Supplies and Bamboo Rafts, Etc.</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 18th) at around 7:00 a.m., the enemy's small transport ships Third Ryumaru, Haisemaru, Yotaimaru, Twelfth Unkaimaru, Hirotamaru Fifth Ship, fully loaded with bamboo rafts and military supplies, continued to sail to Shanghai. They are currently temporarily docked at China Merchants Bureau Huazhan, New Huishan Wharf, and Mitsubishi Wharf on the Puxi side, preparing to join forces with the small transport ships Matsumaru, Kaimaru, Momaru, Sanwamaru, and Thirteenth Unkaimaru, which also arrived in Shanghai fully loaded with bamboo rafts the day before yesterday (the 17th), for a total of ten ships, to sail to the upper reaches of the Wusong River. In addition, dozens of our small fire transports originally docked in South Huangpu have been towed by the enemy to the Puxi side of the Mitsubishi Wharf area. After the chimneys of each ship have been numbered and painted, most of them have been sailed by the enemy to the upper reaches of the Wusong River for application. Currently, only three or four ships remain docked at Mitsubishi Wharf.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Various Places Return to the Country to Serve</h3>
<p>A Batch from Kuala Lumpur Has Arrived, Those Assembled in Singapore Are En Route; Assembling Various Specialized Talents to Return to the Country to Participate in the War</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in various places (who have organized a 'Return to the Country to Participate in the War Service Corps') - The first batch, returning to the country from Little Luzon, arrived in Beijing last month, mostly mechanical experts and technicians. Now, the second batch, from Jilongpo in the Nanyang Islands, voluntarily registered at the local consulate to join the front-line service in the motherland's war of resistance. Most are machine experts and various technicians. Those who have been organized into teams include Wen Zhuyun, Yu Bingjiu, Wu Hongjin, Bai Yunbiao, etc. These overseas Chinese, feeling heartache over the motherland's violent invasion, have all stated to the consulate that they are willing to return to the country at their own expense, report to the Military Affairs Commission in Nanjing, and await dispatch to the front to participate in various mechanical work in the war. The overseas Chinese have already arrived in Hong Kong from Kuala Lumpur, and are seeking ways to transfer from Hong Kong to Hankou, and then to Nanjing. There is also a third batch, the War Service Corps, which is composed of overseas Chinese from various places in Singapore, totaling more than 200 people, including various specialized talents. They have already departed from Singapore and will arrive in the capital within ten days.</p>
<h3>American Missionaries in War Zone Have Not Encountered Accidents</h3>
<p>Reuters, Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - A telephone call received today from a Chinese military authority provided information on the actual whereabouts of American missionaries in the war zone. Five American missionaries are still stationed in Guangfu, about fifteen miles from Suzhou. Unless the situation is urgent, they will continue to handle refugee relief work. At the same time, American Ambassador Johnson is currently seeking to negotiate with Japanese aircraft not to bomb the area. Two American missionaries are stationed in Huzhou, and four American missionaries are stationed in Moganshan. There are also three foreign families seeking refuge, the number of people is unknown. There is no major danger in remote areas around Moganshan and Taihu Lake. Two American missionaries are stationed in Changshu. Dr. Jian Tesen, the superintendent of the American Church Hospital in Changzhou, and three American nurses, led the Chinese staff of the hospital in three freight trucks from Changzhou to Beijing last night. Due to the heavy rain, they were spared from being bombed by Japanese aircraft. The wounded soldiers in the hospital have all been transferred to other places by the Chinese Red Cross Society. Civilians with minor injuries have been sent home, and those with serious injuries have been transferred to the Red Swastika Society Hospital. The hospital is still temporarily working. According to the team, Japanese aircraft only bombed the station and the West Gate in Changzhou on Sunday.</p>
<h3>Traitors and Ruffians Take Advantage of the Situation to Become Active</h3>
<p>The great fire in the Nanshi area will soon be a week old, and there are still embers not extinguished in the area within Xiaoximen. However, Nanshi was not prepared for war in the March Resistance, and the Japanese side, except for a bombing of Nanshi Railway Station, has generally been quiet near the city. Therefore, even if residents temporarily fled to the concessions, most of their movable property was not taken away. By the time things became urgent, transportation was cut off, so there was a lot of property hidden inside. Since the great fire, ruffians and traitors have colluded with each other, looting movable property in the area and openly selling it in Tangjiawan and other places. There is a group of rogue villains from other provinces and local ruffians who have gone to Nanshi from the concessions to seek wealth by submitting to the traitors. During the great fire in Xian Gua Street Ginseng Bird's Nest businesses, ruffians retrieved two boxes of ginseng from the ashes, and beans, wheat, and other goods from the bean and wheat businesses were transported to the north of the city and have already been sold. However, the Japanese do not trust these opportunistic Chinese.</p>
<h3>The World is Amazed by Our Heroic Resistance</h3>
<p>Views of British Newspapers</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th (Central News Agency) - The News Chronicle recently commented on the Sino-Japanese dispute, saying, "The world is amazed by China's heroic resistance to Japanese aggression. In the future, its resistance will inevitably be strengthened. General Chiang Kai-shek's bravery, coupled with the assistance of Madam Chiang, is especially a good example for the Chinese people." The Daily Telegraph commented on the establishment of the Japanese General Headquarters, saying that when the two countries conduct peace negotiations in the future, it is not known where the center of Japanese politics will be. The Japanese government has become a tool of the military. Although the policies pursued by the army are slightly more moderate than those of the navy, and may avoid international disputes in Shanghai, it is questionable who controls the command of the Japanese army, whether it is the front-line generals or the Tokyo military clique. Now that the General Headquarters has been announced, at least the responsibility can be determined. Then, to what extent does the Japanese army want to invade China, and what are its desires, or will it be clear at a glance.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Foreign Trade in October Decreased Sharply</h3>
<p>Decreased by 40 Million Yuan Compared to the Same Month Last Year; No Import or Export of Gold and Silver in October</p>
<p>The Customs announced the foreign trade report for October. In this month, the net value of goods imported from various countries to Shanghai was 8,610,207 yuan, and the net value of goods exported from Shanghai to various countries was 14,213,840 yuan. In the same month last year, imports were 18,648,744 yuan, and exports were 31,280,463 yuan. There were no imports or exports of gold and silver in October. In this month, a total of 25 ships sailed into Shanghai from foreign countries, of which 16 were British. A total of 14 ships sailed out to foreign countries, of which 7 were British. A total of 82 ships sailed into Shanghai from various Chinese ports, of which 48 were British. A total of 86 ships sailed from Shanghai to various Chinese ports, of which 53 were British. According to the Shanghai's import and export trade report for October, the loss was as high as 41 million yuan compared to the same month last year.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Public Bond Solicitation Association Moved to Hankou to Work</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the National Salvation Public Bond Solicitation Association has been closed, and the Ministry of Finance has moved it to Hankou to work. The current funds raised by the association in Shanghai were all received by various banks and have been fully transferred to the national treasury. All matters related to bond printing, management, verification, and issuance are handled directly by the Ministry of Finance. The association is only responsible for solicitation and does not receive cash or exchange bond tickets. It is heard that since the association was established in August, it has been more than three months, and it has only spent a total of 25,889 yuan, including 7,651 yuan for postage and telecommunications, 9,858 yuan for printing and storing gold savings booklets for various banks and provincial branches, and advertising and printing expenses. The association's three-month recurring expenses were only several thousand yuan, including 1,154 yuan for meals, 1,780 yuan for other consumables and miscellaneous expenses, 1,517 yuan for stationery, 606 yuan for purchasing equipment, and 3,320 yuan for employee allowances. It is very economical. Among the printing expenses, there were 3,700 yuan for printing various patriotic newspapers and magazines that transferred funds to purchase salvation bonds. The landlord of the Dumei Road address of the association did not charge rent, and the staff, in addition to the employees, were all volunteers and did not receive salaries. The advertisements published by the association in various newspapers were also out of patriotic enthusiasm and were purely voluntary publications, which are all admirable.</p>
<h3>Ships Occupied in Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Ten Jianghai Customs patrol ships, anti-smuggling ships, and other large and small ships were seized by the enemy. Only the grain transport ships Meteor and Haiguang were not occupied by the enemy. The situation has been reported in the newspapers. Now, more details are explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Grain Transport Ship Meteor Leaves Shanghai</p>
<p>The Customs grain transport ship Meteor left Shanghai yesterday afternoon because it was important to supply food to the lighthouse keepers and continued to perform its duties as usual. Haiguang remained docked in Shanghai. As for the ten ships that were seized, although the Customs authorities have taken action to deal with them, there is still no news of their return, so the Chinese and foreign tax police and anti-smuggling personnel on the ships have not been able to resume work.</p>
<p>Investigation of Ships Occupied by the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau</p>
<p>In addition to the large dredger Jian Gu Hao and the large surveying ship Li Liang Hao, the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau also had more than ten small surveying ships and ferry transports such as Li Guo, Li Jiang, Li Ming, Li Tai, and Li Wang that were also occupied. At the same time, the Zhonghe coal transport ship of the Zhongxing Company was also occupied, and the crew members were driven off the ship.</p>
<p>Two City Ferries Also Occupied</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the two city ferries No. 4 and No. 5, which operate between the Bund and Gaoqiao, were also towed away by the enemy's small motorboats and are now docked on the Puxi side of Buoy No. 22. Enemy flags have been raised on the ships.</p>
<p>Large Number of Sandboats Towed Away for Use</p>
<p>A large number of sandboats parked near the 16th Pier blockade, in addition to those that were burned by the enemy army a few days ago, the remaining ships with relatively intact hulls have also been towed away by the enemy army to the Wusongkou and South Huangpu areas for transporting reinforcements and military supplies.</p>
<p>Large Tugboat Driven Away by Enemy Yesterday</p>
<p>A large tugboat of the Jiangnan Shipyard, which was the fastest tugboat in the Huangpu River, was not sunk in time when our army retreated. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, it was also seized by the enemy and taken to the Hongkou Puxi side for the enemy's use.</p>
<h3>Matsui Pays Return Visit to British Naval and Military Commanders</h3>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, British Fleet Commander in China, Lieutenant General Reed, paid his first visit to enemy commander Matsui a few days ago. According to British sources, Matsui went to the British flagship Kent at 10:00 a.m. on the 17th to pay a return visit to Lieutenant General Reed and British Defense Forces Commander in Shanghai, General Smallwood.</p>
<h3>British Public Opinion on Speculation About the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>If Other Countries Do Not Intervene and Mediate, China Will Have No Room for Seeking Peace; Relocation of the Capital is a Sign of Unyielding</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th (Central News Agency) - Today's editorial in the Daily Telegraph stated regarding the Far East war: "Japan has not been able to advance as expected, and although the Chinese military equipment is inferior, it has not prevented it from showing its brave spirit, which is at least no less than that of the Japanese army. Furthermore, although Japan has attempted to subdue China with aircraft bombings, China has not shown any signs of mental collapse. China's resistance not only shows its bravery but is also inspiring because it shows that the terroristic arrogance is as ineffective in this area as it is in the Far East." The Daily Telegraph deeply regrets the current long-term war between China and Japan and feels that the two countries are gathering their strength after a period of respite to await the second more permanent hand-to-hand combat. Regarding mediation, the newspaper said that if other countries do not intervene and mediate, China will have no room for seeking peace, and Japan will not be able to propose reasonable conditions. The newspaper further stated that the support of the entire country for Chairman Chiang proves that China cannot be geographically unified, but on the other hand, what we have to question is where the center of Japanese politics is, or who can authorize the start of negotiations, and define the purpose of its war. The Daily Telegraph further inquired who directed the will of the Japanese army and stated that the establishment of the current General Headquarters should at least be able to define its responsibilities and thereby determine how far Japan is willing to go in China and how vast the land it "wishes to devour at present" is.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Manchester Guardian commented today on the Japanese organization of the General Headquarters and the movement in the Japanese parliament to allocate funds to enhance the spirit of Japan, saying that no matter what victories the Japanese army may achieve, the Japanese people will pay a heavy price, and the balance of Japan's economic life will be seriously and permanently hit. The News Chronicle praised Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and said that China's resistance has aroused the admiration of the world, and it has become stronger and more powerful due to the efforts of the highest authorities in the government. The Birmingham Post said that if Japan's victory had occurred a year ago, it might have caused Nanjing to flee, but today its effect has instead strengthened resistance. The relocation of the capital is a sign of unyielding rather than an admission of defeat.</p>

<h3>"How Can We Endure"</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang's Broadcast Address Last Night</p>
<p>[Nanjing] At the invitation of the Jinling Broadcasting Station, Chairman Wang gave a radio address at the station from 8:00 PM to 8:15 PM on the 18th, titled "How Can We Endure," instructing the people on methods for long-term resistance. The original words are as follows:</p>
<p>In this war of resistance, we must firmly remember that only through sacrifice can we endure, and only through endurance can we achieve final victory. The Songhu Resistance lasted for two months, with countless brave soldiers and generals using their blood and flesh to build fortifications to resist the combined bombardment of the enemy's naval, land, and air forces. Without orders, they would rather die than retreat. This kind of sacrifice is unprecedented and magnificent in war history. With this spirit of sacrifice as the foundation for our war of resistance, we can then study how to endure. At the beginning of the Lugouqiao Incident, the enemy mistakenly believed that our previous acts of forbearance were out of fear and cowardice, mistakenly believing that they could obtain everything in China without effort. However, when they encountered our resolute resistance, they had to change their plans and suffer heavy losses before achieving their objectives. In the past three months, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan have successively fallen, and the Songhu army has also been forced to retreat. The enemy mistakenly believes that the war can now come to an end and they can sit and wait for China's submission. However, when they see our unyielding and persistent attitude, they have no choice but to adopt a "do or die" mentality and attack to the end to respond to our war of resistance to the end. According to the enemy's recent actions and the extent of their official ambitions, they will occupy our cities along the Yangtze River as much as possible, from Wusong to Yichang. Each city will be garrisoned with heavy troops and create puppet regimes, using aircraft and Yangtze River fleets for communication, connecting the head and tail of Wu and Chu into one. Then, with their remaining strength, they will slowly penetrate into the interior, carving up the southeastern half of our country piece by piece. Regardless of whether the enemy can achieve this, there is no doubt that they intend to do so. So, what should we do? Specifically, how can we endure? This is what everyone should clearly study and be prepared for. Whether we can endure depends on whether our combat capabilities can be preserved and expanded. Besides military matters, there are three other major issues: First is the economy. In recent decades, China's prosperity has gradually shifted to the coastal areas, which is a commonly recognized fact. Using such immature industry and commerce as the foundation for modern warfare is already weak. If the coastal areas are lost, then using the declining and exhausted agriculture and handicrafts of the interior as the foundation for modern warfare will be even weaker. Therefore, in terms of economy, we should make twelve times the effort to maintain it and seek its development. Not only must we do everything possible to avoid losing the coastal areas, but we should also deeply study the sources of decline and exhaustion in the interior. As the saying goes, "Cities are like flowers, and villages are like roots." If the roots are not strong, the prosperity of the flowers is only temporary. We must strengthen the roots so that they can blossom and bear fruit, and prosperity can be endless. If we can strive here, concentrate our human and material resources, and engage in management, cultivate agriculture and handicrafts, and actively build up industry and commerce with a spirit of creation, this will not only fill the gaps in the cities but also bring about universal prosperity in the rural areas of the interior. This is the first major task that we should strive to achieve with twelve times the effort. The second is transportation. Recently, people often mention so-called mobile warfare. This belongs to military matters and need not be discussed, but what must be noted is that the environment most suitable for using mobile warfare is where transportation is inconvenient, whether it is a desert, barren land, mountain ranges, or crisscrossing rivers, making it difficult for vehicles on land and soldiers on water, and where bridges are not convenient at points of disconnection. Only then can mobile warfare slightly exert its effects. Proof of this can be found in the era of bandit suppression. When highways were not yet open, one side chased and the other fled, one side was exhausted from running, and the other was elusive. However, once the highways were open, the one who was like a fly flying around in a room was now difficult to escape. In recent years, the highway network has been completed. If used well, it will facilitate our transportation; if used poorly, it will benefit the enemy. Therefore, in terms of transportation, we should make twelve times the effort to control it, ensuring that the highways built with our countless blood and sweat are only for our use and not for the enemy's use. Furthermore, every village must protect itself, and every family must defend itself. Dig as many trenches as possible, build as many fortresses as possible, so that the enemy will run into obstacles at every turn and step on thorns at every step. As the saying goes, "Biting a bone breaks your own teeth." Then, we should only fear that they will not penetrate deeply. After penetrating deeply, they will not be able to return without leaving their lives behind. This is the second major task that we should strive to achieve with twelve times the effort. The third is the people. Three hundred years ago, the Manchus, with a population of only five million, dominated our population of four hundred million. Their only secret was to use Chinese money to support Chinese soldiers to kill Chinese people. Recently, the enemy has been hastily organizing puppet governments wherever they go, imitating this secret as their blueprint. If we do not make twelve times the effort to awaken the people, then this kind of disaster will be unavoidable. I have heard some people say, "Why is it that this war of resistance is not like the Northern Expedition, where we saw mass rallies of the people everywhere?" To answer this question, rather than saying that the war situations are different, it is better to say that the meanings are different. The meaning of the Northern Expedition placed emphasis on politics, so enthusiastic propaganda was most necessary. This war of resistance is a struggle for the survival of the country and the nation. Its meaning is known to everyone, so calm work is more important than enthusiastic propaganda. The rural people make up the largest number of people in the country and are also the most powerful. They are frugal and hardworking, constantly engaged in production. They may seem ignorant, but they have a pure conscience. Since the war of resistance began, besides the soldiers at the front bravely resisting the enemy in the trenches, the rural people in the rear have undertaken all kinds of hard work, which is far beyond what those in the cities who only shout slogans and do not take responsibility can compare to. Unfortunately, those who only shout slogans and do not take responsibility only know about mass rallies of the people and do not see the people's dedicated work, so they raise this question, which is not worth refuting. For these most numerous people, first, we must strive to improve the economic conditions mentioned above to enrich their lives and capabilities; second, we must strive to improve the transportation conditions mentioned above to ensure their safety and activities; and third, we must also organize and train them to strengthen their combat capabilities. Then, not only will puppet regimes have no way to arise, but even if they do arise, they will be reduced to ashes along with those who pull the strings. This is the third major task that we should strive to achieve with twelve times the effort. We must strive to achieve the above three major tasks so that this war of resistance can endure and achieve final victory through endurance. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Food Supply Problem Will Soon Improve</h3>
<p>Rice Boats from the Southern District Can Be Towed to the Concessions for Unloading Soon; The First Batch of Foreign Rice Ordered by the Municipal Council Will Soon Arrive in Shanghai; Thirty-Two New Rice Shops Established in the Concessions</p>
<p>Since our army strategically withdrew its troops from Zhabei, Pudong, and the Southern District one after another, all land and water transportation has been controlled by the enemy. Before our army withdrew, the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association purchased rice from Changshu, Xikun, Wu, He, Song, and the Fifth District to supply the people, and the rice boats were successively berthed at the Nanhupu Rihui Port, Bailianjing, Coal Wharf, and Xuejia浜 Rice Industry Wharf, totaling one hundred fifty to one hundred sixty ships, carrying approximately twenty-seven to twenty-eight thousand shi of rice. When our army resolutely defended the Southern District and Pudong, the area became a war zone, making it impossible to transport the rice until now. A portion of the boatmen and cargo have suffered losses due to the war, or have been injured or killed, the situation is extremely tragic. Currently, Shanghai's rice industry leaders Gu Xinyi, together with representatives from the Bean and Rice Industry, the Rice Distribution Industry, the Rice Shop Industry, and the Changshu Guild Hall, such as Fu Qianeng, Gu Yisheng, Lu Muqin, and Shi Zufu, are trying to rescue the situation. They have formally listed the names of the boatmen and the rice merchants or rice shops that directly purchased the rice, and jointly sent a letter to the International Relief Committee, urging them to make every effort to dredge the situation to maintain Shanghai's food supply. According to the reporter of Dagong News, Father Raoul, the person in charge of the International Relief Committee, accepted the request of the distressed rice merchants and has been running around contacting various parties. It is expected that tugboats can be hired to transport the rice within days. The unloading locations have also been discussed with the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, with unloading to take place at the Bund outside Wuma Road and the Bund outside Fada Road.</p>
<p>The First Batch of Foreign Rice Arrives Today</p>
<p>According to rice industry news, the rice shop industry is not only trying to apply to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for passports to transport rice from Eastern Zhejiang, intending to purchase two thousand shi of rice from the Lin, Huang, and Wen regions of Eastern Zhejiang to be transported to Shanghai on foreign Shengtái steamships to meet urgent needs, but also the Public Concession Municipal Council and the French Concession Board of Directors have reportedly ordered large quantities of rice from Saigon and Siam, totaling one hundred thousand bags. The first batch of over ten thousand bags is expected to arrive today, and the rest is planned to be transported within this month. As for the twenty thousand shi of rice transported from the surrounding countryside, it is still loaded on over two hundred civilian boats moored in the Southern Huangpu River. The rice merchants are contacting various parties to facilitate the release of the rice to Shanghai to meet the needs. Based on the above situation, Shanghai's food supply problem will soon improve. According to another source, middle and upper-class residents in Shanghai have at least one month's worth of rice stored. The most panic-stricken at present are ordinary civilians and vendors, but the rice distributed to various rice shops by the Municipal Council can still cope with the situation.</p>
<p>More Rice Shops Added to Meet Demand</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is paying close attention to maintaining Shanghai's food supply. In addition to supervising various rice industry groups to dredge the sources and suppress rice prices, it is also concerned that the citizens are crowded in the concessions and that the rice shops in the concessions may not be able to meet the supply. Therefore, through Zhang Nianguan, Chairman of the Rice Shop Industry Association, it has persuaded various rice merchants to add rice shops in the concessions to meet the demand. It is reported that thirty-two new rice shops have recently been established, including Gongtai Rongji, Detai, Tongcheng, and Gongtai Quan, Yèsongji, etc. All of them have had their licenses issued by the Donations Office of the Municipal Council through the Chamber of Commerce and will open today.</p>
<h3>Temporary Offices Established by Post Offices in the Southern District and Other Places</h3>
<p>According to news from the post office, post offices in Shanghai's Southern District, Pudong, and Longhua are currently temporarily operating at the following branches: (1) The Huajin Road, Guoma Road, and Lanni Du (Pudong) branches are currently operating at the Gongguanma Road branch; (2) The Dananmen and Ximen branches are currently operating at the Kaizi'er Road branch; (3) The Nanshi and Bund branches are operating at the Fujian Road branch; (4) The Gaochangmiao branch is currently operating at the Kangti Road branch; (5) The Laobeimen branch is currently operating at the Sichuan Road branch; (6) The Longhua branch is currently operating at the Xujiahui branch. All registered and ordinary mail delivered by the Huajin Road, Guoma Road, Gaochangmiao, Lanni Du, and Longhua branches are now stored at the above-mentioned branches for collection. The storage period is ten days, after which the mail will be returned.</p>
<h3>The Order in the Nanshi Refugee Area is Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>Security Guards Have Measures; Hospitals Are Being Established One After Another; Yesterday, 1,000 Refugees from Bailianjing Were Accepted</p>
<p>The order in the Nanshi refugee area has gradually returned to normal. There are many shelters organized by various charities and hometown associations. Refugees who were once homeless and standing on the streets now have places to stay. The refugees' food supply, thanks to enthusiastic donations from all walks of life, is temporarily not in danger of running out. As for security matters in the area, there are also measures in place. During the day, priests from various churches are responsible for patrolling, and at night, foreign and Chinese detectives from the French Concession are requested to join forces with the temporary merchant corps organized by wealthy residents and merchants in the area to share the responsibility of security. Because some merchants in the area are still open for business to buy small items for the refugees, a temporary merchant corps has been formed, with Shen XinFu in charge of handling the order in the area, which is therefore very good. Regarding fire prevention matters, fire extinguishers have been installed in various main streets in the area to prevent the spread of fire from outside the area. Although the tap water has not been repaired, well water has been connected, so it can also be said to be safe. In recent days, inspection teams organized by various charities have gone to the area, but they were shot at by enemy troops. Fortunately, no accidents occurred. The office in the area, in order to maintain safety, has politely declined visits.</p>
<p>Accepting Pudong Refugees</p>
<p>After the fall of Pudong, many refugees entered the concession one after another. There was still a group who failed to escape in time and took refuge at the Da Lai Wharf, an American merchant in Bailianjing, waiting for rescue. There were about a thousand people. For several days, they suffered from hunger and cold, and were also attacked by wind and rain. Their miserable situation cannot be described in words. Until yesterday, the authorities in the Nanshi refugee area, after consultation with the Japanese military authorities, were allowed to release this group of dying refugees to cross the river to Shanghai for shelter. After consultation and agreement, several large barges were dispatched to transport all the more than 960 refugees at the Bailianjing Wharf to Puxi and send them to the Nanshi refugee area for shelter.</p>
<p>Attention to Adopting Orphans</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association, in view of the many displaced orphans in the Nanshi refugee area, and in order to facilitate relief work, specially established a temporary office in the area yesterday, headed by Deputy Secretary-General Chen Tiesheng, Secretary Zhou Jian, and Xu Zuo. They also entrusted the Catholic Church, Small World, Houjia Road and other shelters to start accepting children. According to Mr. Chen, any children between the ages of four and fourteen who are homeless or unable to be adopted will be taken in as much as possible. When necessary, the association will expand to accommodate women and children, and plans to find a larger house in the concession, hoping that enthusiastic people will lend it to them so that a large number can be accommodated. The association is scheduled to hold a regular meeting this Saturday to discuss various matters such as expanding the accommodation.</p>
<p>Hospitals Being Established One After Another</p>
<p>According to news from the International Relief Association, yesterday the association distributed 200,000 loaves of bread in the refugee area. Residents in the area are now also voluntarily taking in refugees. The association is responsible for supplying food. The order has been improving day by day. There are about 20 shelters organized by various charities. The cleaning and sweeping are well cooperated by the residents. The streets have gradually been cleared. There are many women in labor in the area now. The office specially established a temporary obstetrics hospital in the Nanshi Circulation Library yesterday, which is sponsored by the Catholic Church. However, medicines such as zhegu vegetable renshen (ginseng) pills and ten drops of water are lacking, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate them. In recent days, people from various countries have donated a lot of food and white sugar. The association will pay special attention to the elderly, the weak, and children, and absolutely prohibit unscrupulous refugees from reselling bread.</p>
<p>The Shien Refugee Hospital at No. 456 Jiujiang Road is solely funded by Zhu Shien, providing free medical treatment and medicine, hospitalization and outpatient services. Wounded people from various charitable organizations, relief committees, and hospitals are constantly being sent there. The space is crowded. Six tall western-style buildings were rented at No. 23 to 27 Cile Lane, Nanjing Road, to set up a second branch. It happened that the Renji Hall led refugees to live there, so it was not opened. It is now heard that there are many wounded people in Nanshi who are in urgent need of treatment. Therefore, the self-owned property at No. 25 Anren Street in the refugee area was used to set up a third branch. Feeling that the staff had inconvenient transportation, Secretary Hu Jianbo, on behalf of the hospital, asked Father Rao for help to facilitate them.</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society Buries Corpses</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society, in view of the fact that there are many refugee corpses in the Nanshi area, in addition to sending relief teams to bury them for days, the team transported ten pieces of wood yesterday, found four corpses, and buried them. The association also transported more than 20,000 pieces of food, as well as medicines and bedding. The police also transported four trucks of food donated by various sectors, which were all distributed and released by the team. The excess food was handed over to the office in the area for storage.</p>

<h3>The First Batch of Refugees Relocated from War Zone to Depart Within Days</h3>
<p>Relocation Sites Designated as Gaochun and Liyang; Jiangsu Provincial Government Allocates 35,000 Mu of Land</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the War Zone Refugee Relocation Association, since the start of the all-out war of resistance, the association, in view of the fact that refugees in the war zone have no homes to return to and are indeed pitiful, has actively planned the relocation of refugees in the war zone. The original plan was: 1) The Jiangnan area will first be piloted in Jiangsu Province; 2) The refugees in the coastal provinces of South China will be relocated to Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces; 3) The refugees in Shandong, Hebei, and Henan in North China will be relocated to Shaanxi and Gansu in the Northwest. Now the first batch of 1,000 people will depart within days. The sites are Gaochun and Liyang, and 35,000 mu of land have been allocated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. All procedures have been completed. In the future, the new village plan will adhere to the principles of public operation, public consumption, and hard work in production. One thousand people will form one village, and 250 people will form one Zhuang. The distribution of the productive forces of a village will be approximately six times for men and two times for women. Up to now, the number of people solicited to work has reached five or six hundred. After selection, about 4,000 people will go to take on the guidance work of education, agriculture, and handicrafts. The association's expenses, excluding the cost of building agricultural tools and eight months of living expenses, will be approximately 50,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attack Wuxi Day and Night</h3>
<p>After a long period of rain, Wuxi finally cleared up on the 8th. Enemy planes became active again. After 12 o'clock that night, two enemy planes came to Wuxi for a night raid, dropping seven flares, three of which were in the central area of the city, two in Zhoujing Lane, and one each at Yacheng Bridge and Shidai Bridge. The light was extremely strong, like daylight. Then they dropped three bombs. One landed at the home of Li Peizhen, No. 88 Dong Da Lou Lane, destroying two sheds. One landed at the home of Gu Yaodou, No. 7 Xiaohe, destroying several houses. At that time, it was the middle of the night, and the residents were all asleep. Although the losses were not very heavy, they were extremely frightened. There was also a bomb that landed near the Yongyu Silk Factory in Yangyaowan, and the loss was still slight. This was the first time that enemy planes came to Wuxi for a night raid and bombed the central area of the city. On September 1, alarms were sounded all day long, a total of eleven times. At about 9 o'clock in the morning, two enemy planes flew in from the southeast and dropped two heavy bombs at the railway station. The explosions were extremely loud, destroying a section of the station's ticket office and a section of the railway track. At that time, our anti-aircraft machine guns and artillery fired together. One plane fled to the southeast in a panic, and the tail of one plane emitted white smoke after being hit, and it fled to the west in a panic. It turned back near Gaoqiao, flying extremely low. There were a total of seven people in the plane, which could be counted clearly. It was heard that it landed in Suzhou. After 12 o'clock at night, three enemy planes came to Wuxi for a night raid, dropping six or seven flares, circling for a long time, and then dropped six bombs on the Su-Xi Road, destroying a section of the road surface. On the 10th, from 8:30 a.m. to 1:50 p.m., six enemy planes circled and reconnoitered over the city, dropping more than 40 bombs. It is reported that the Fulaihe Sauce Garden outside the West Gate and the bamboo row next to the Cang Bridge were hit by bombs and destroyed. Two bombs also landed in front of the Shenxin and Zhenxin yarn factories. Fortunately, the factories had already stopped work, and only six male and female workers were injured. In addition, many civilian houses in Huixiaozi Temple in Huishan, the sesame cake shop at Miaoxiangkou, the Yaohuo store at Longtou 塲, and the Baoshan Bridge area were burned after being bombed.</p>

<h3>Washington's Telegram Says the Nine-Power Treaty Conference Will End</h3>
<p>British Labor Party Members Advocate Joint Action; American Congressmen Demand Implementation of the Neutrality Act Unsuccessfully; Ambassador Guo Says He is Satisfied with the Progress of the Conference</p>
<p>[New York] The New York Times' Washington correspondent reported today on the future of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, saying that Washington officials, based on official reports from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and in view of the policies of the United States and other related countries, expect that if there are no major changes in the situation, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will have to adjourn or recess on Monday, and the representatives will all pack their bags and return home. It is now heard that the conference does not intend to suggest to the related countries to provide assistance or use other substantive methods to help China, because there is no practical method to facilitate the achievement of this goal. Washington officials believe that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will definitely end, and in the current environment, ending the conference is the best policy. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] After returning to London from Beijing, Chinese Ambassador to the UK Guo Taiqi met with a Reuters diplomatic reporter and said that unofficial talks among the representatives of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference have revealed a clear feeling that the crisis in the Far East must not be allowed to drag on with mere empty talk. He felt that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference had adopted a satisfactory path, and its clear and direct response to Japan's refusal to participate was even more powerful, because the Nine-Power Treaty Conference had always shown patience and consideration for Japan. The speeches of the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France were extremely important. They all emphasized respecting the treaty as the only basis for an orderly and civilized life among nations; otherwise, the world would fall into a state of lawlessness. The consensus of the three countries' representatives is also a response to the anti-communist agreement of Italy, Germany, and Japan. Ambassador Guo and his wife attended a welcome party hosted by King Leopold in Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. Ambassador Guo plans to return to Beijing tomorrow. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] Labor Party member Henderson asked Undersecretary Cramborne in the House of Commons today, given the resolution of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, will the British government suggest to the related countries to stop supplying Japan with arms on the one hand, and continue to supply China with arms on the other hand? Cramborne replied that the countries that passed the declaration of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on Monday are considering what their common attitude should be to deal with Japan and abide by the obligations of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Paris Pact. However, before the Nine-Power Treaty Conference continues to meet, it is not possible to predict the chances of reaching an agreement on any common action. Henderson also said that if China needs assistance, there must be positive actions in addition to passing resolutions. Please pay attention to this point, Cramborne. Conservative Party Adams asked whether it is intended to adopt a plan of collective pressure to restrain aggressor countries in the Far East. Cramborne said, please do not raise this question. Labor Party member Noel-Baker asked whether the government believes that the declaration of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference does not conflict with the League of Nations' resolution condemning Japan as an aggressor. Cramborne replied, it does not conflict. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Washington] Wisconsin Congressman Su Shuangfu proposed a general bill in the House of Representatives today, saying that the convening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is enough to prove that the Far East has entered a state of war. Please President Roosevelt immediately invoke the Neutrality Act. After Su Shuangfu proposed this draft, the House of Representatives immediately began to debate. Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, McKinley, opposed Cao Tao Fu's motion. Republican Congressman Fischer immediately attacked McKinley, saying, "If the government still claims to be unaware of the war currently going on in China, then we should replace the current Secretary of State." McKinley immediately replied to Fischer, "The President will never be forced to admit that a state of war already exists. It is inappropriate for any country to call the current conflict between China and Japan a war. Why must we be different from other countries?" (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>[Washington] At the meeting of the House of Representatives today, Congressman Su Shuangfu of the Progressive Party of Wisconsin proposed a motion criticizing President Roosevelt's approach to the dispute between China and Japan and demanding the implementation of the Neutrality Act. Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, McKinley, immediately delivered a speech in support of President Roosevelt's current policy and asked the House to reject Su Shuangfu's motion. McKinley said, after the implementation of the Neutrality Act, it would only benefit Japan. At a time when China still needs to obtain arms from foreign countries, if the United States implements the Neutrality Act, it would be appropriate to complete Japan's policy of blockading China, which is not what the United States should do. (Central News Agency, 17th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Washington] When the Senate meets in the next few days, it will definitely discuss the dispute between China and Japan. Senator Nie of the Democratic Party of North Dakota has expressed his strong opposition to President Roosevelt's policies, especially the possible impact of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. In addition, isolationists also said that after President Roosevelt delivered a speech in Chicago on the 5th of last month, the general impression was that the US government might ask Congress to amend the current Neutrality Act in order to promote international cooperation policies, and therefore expressed dissatisfaction. This group believes that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has failed and has no excuse. Those who advocate amending the Neutrality Act say that the implementation of the Neutrality Act only benefits aggressor countries, but their attitude seems to be less resolute than that of the isolationists. Regarding this matter, general observers believe that when the Senate submits it for discussion in the future, the result will not be optimistic. (Central News Agency, 17th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Japan Establishes General Headquarters; New Military Order Announced Yesterday</h3>
<p>Army and Navy Authorities Issue Statements; Revised Wartime General Headquarters Regulations</p>
<p>[Tokyo] As a result of the Army and Navy's request for approval on the 17th, it was decided to announce the decree in the official gazette on the 18th, abolishing the wartime general headquarters regulations that had been in place, and simultaneously announcing a new military order. The Army and Navy authorities announced today that the wartime general headquarters regulations were promulgated on December 26, Meiji 36 (1903) as Imperial Decree No. 293. This time, the general headquarters is changed to one that can be established when necessary during wartime or when an incident occurs. Military Order No. 1 was formulated on the 17th to establish the general headquarters order and order its implementation.</p>
<p>Military Order No. 1, the General Headquarters Order, is as follows: Article 1: The Supreme Command is established under the Emperor's banner, called the General Headquarters. The General Headquarters is established when necessary during wartime or during an incident.</p>
<p>Article 2: The Chief of the General Staff and the Chief of the Naval General Staff are each his staff, serving the internal affairs of the tent, participating in planning strategies, to achieve the ultimate goal, and seeking joint cooperation between the army and navy as their mission.</p>
<p>Article 3: The formation and service of the General Headquarters are determined separately.</p>
<p>The contents of the General Headquarters Order will organize the wartime general headquarters regulations that are not applicable to the current situation, and there are approximately three articles in total. The first article clearly states when the general headquarters should be established, that is, the old article "The Supreme Command is placed under the Emperor's authority and is called the General Headquarters" adds the phrase "during wartime or when an incident occurs" to indicate that it is applicable not only during wartime but also during an incident. The old article in the second article contains words such as higher education department. These words have become meaningless during the Russo-Japanese War, so the new article completely deletes these words and only states "The organization of the General Headquarters is determined separately in another document" to indicate that the establishment of the General Headquarters is based on mobilization, and its organization is based on wartime organization. The third article stipulates the cooperation of the army and navy in the General Headquarters. The old article "The Chief of the General Staff and the Chief of the Naval General Staff are each his staff, serving the internal affairs of the tent, participating in planning strategies to achieve the ultimate goal, and seeking joint cooperation between the army and navy as their mission" changes the phrase Chief of the Naval General Staff to Chief of the Naval General Staff. The other articles are slightly the same as the old articles. The fourth and fifth articles of the old articles are cancelled. (Allied Telegram, 18th)</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Discusses the Status Quo of Peiping and Tientsin</h3>
<p>Undersecretary of State Declares that Japan Has Not Interfered with the Concession</p>
<p>[London] Undersecretary of State Cramborne replied to Conservative Party member Moore in the House of Commons today, saying that Foreign Secretary Eden had not received any reports of trade encountering any obstacles in the British Concession in Tientsin, and the concession had not been subjected to any interference. As for the administration of Peiping and Tientsin, since the Japanese army occupied them, there has been an organization called the Peiping and Tientsin Security Maintenance Association, led by Gao Lingwei. This association also has many Japanese advisors. Former Indian Affairs Minister Penn asked Cramborne whether he believes that the Chinese people have recognized this pseudo-regime. Cramborne replied that, according to what he heard, the Chinese people in North China have "tacitly acknowledged" it, but he feels that this question should not be raised. Penn asked Cramborne whether he acknowledges the Japanese view that the so-called Security Maintenance Association has been well received by the people. Cramborne replied that, other than what has already been answered, he cannot say anything further. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters)</p>

<p>[London] Well-informed sources recently stated that London and Washington will simultaneously announce this afternoon that the preliminary negotiations on the British-American trade treaty have made sufficient progress and can be concluded in the near future.

<h3>Germany to Cut Number of Consulates in Russia</h3>
<p>[Berlin] It is heard that the Soviet government has asked all countries to reduce the number of consulates in the Soviet Union. Negotiations are currently underway with Germany. It is likely that Germany will close several consulates in the Soviet Union. According to political circles here, since there are Germans living in the Soviet Union, it is appropriate to maintain consulates. However, the number of Germans living in the Soviet Union has recently decreased significantly, and most of the trade issues between the Soviet Union and Germany have been resolved in Moscow, so it is not necessary to retain all the consulates. According to the opinions of foreign observers, part of the reason for Germany closing consulates is that relations between the Soviet Union and Germany have become increasingly tense since Italy, Germany, and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact.

The fate of humanity is closely related to the fate of Britain itself. You understand the great problems of all mankind with exceptional depth, giving great hope that Great Britain will have a decisive influence in seeking solutions to major economic difficulties. King Leopold said that London is a stage in the world's theater, and the echoes of all the suffering experienced by the world reach London more than other cities. Political goals are only related to a portion of humanity, but the progress of economic life benefits all of humanity. We are today facing a world entangled in national problems. To solve these difficulties, we must have a clear understanding of economic realities and observe them with a calm gaze, without mixing them with other events.

<h3>Britain to Send Commercial Representatives to Spain</h3>
<p>Stationed in the Nationalist Government</p>
<p>[London] Sir Robert Hodgson, former British Chargé d'Affaires to the Soviet Union, has been appointed as the first commissioner to the Spanish Nationalist Government. According to the British Foreign Office, the exchange of commissioners between Britain and the Spanish Nationalists is for the purpose of protecting British citizens and commercial interests within each other's territories. According to the announcement, in order to establish more satisfactory contact between the British government and the territories under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Nationalists, it was agreed that the British government should send a commissioner to Salamanca or elsewhere, and General Franco should also send a commissioner to London. It was also agreed to send a limited number of deputy commissioners to other locations. The stationing of General Franco's commissioner in London cannot be construed as the British government's recognition of General Franco's authority over the territories he controls. Neither side will grant diplomatic status to these commissioners. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] The Chargé d'Affaires of the Spanish Republican government in London, Mr. Azcarate, recently sent a note to the Foreign Office, expressing displeasure with Britain's decision to send officials to Salamanca, the seat of the Nationalist government in Spain. The note stated, in part, "The British government's policy has always been to avoid formal relations with the rebels in Spain. This action is tantamount to abandoning that policy. The Spanish Republican government is very displeased to learn of this." (Central News Agency, 17th, Havas)</p>

<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese government, along with Germany and Italy, has established the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact to strengthen its international anti-communist network. To further expand and strengthen its anti-communist policy, it plans to formally recognize the anti-government forces of Franco in Spain.

<p>[Paris] The Socialist Party parliamentary group held a closed-door meeting this afternoon. The party leader and State Coordinator, Mr. Blum, attended and delivered a speech, in which he discussed the Spanish issue and Britain's attitude. Afterwards, it was rumored in the House of Representatives lounge that Mr. Blum explained the changes in Britain's attitude towards the Spanish Nationalist government and explained that the British authorities no longer hoped for the victory of the Spanish government forces, and therefore decided on various measures to prevent Italy and Germany from gaining a dominant position in Spain in the future. In addition, the Soviet Union also believes that the Spanish government forces have no hope of victory. Mr. Blum recently issued a statement firmly denying the above rumors, saying that he only analyzed the views held by the British public. Conservatives in that country generally believe that the defeat of the Spanish government forces is imminent. As for the attitude of the Soviet Union, he expressed satisfaction because the country has accepted the resolutions of the Adjustment Committee. He did not mention anything else.

<h3>British Shipping Insurance Rates to Shanghai Reduced</h3>

<h3>German Consul in Chongqing Expresses Strong Sympathy for the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>[Xi'an] Li Yizhi previously sent a letter to the German Consul in Chongqing, Mr. Seefeld, regarding the Sino-Japanese War. He has now received a reply from Mr. Seefeld, expressing strong sympathy for China's war of resistance and deep disgust for the atrocities of the Japanese army. The original letter stated, in part, that the Japanese army's aggression is precisely what will help to achieve China's unification. China's war of resistance can gain the most valuable experience, which will be of great benefit to China's future. Although the Japanese army has come to invade with its latest weapons, no one can believe that it can achieve its ambition of annexing China. This time, Chinese soldiers are bravely fighting for national survival, and their heroic sacrifices have deeply shocked Japan. I am well aware that the Japanese army's large-scale invasion of China is due to China's increasing self-strengthening in recent years. As for the long-standing friendly relations between China and Germany, a reading of the German newspapers will reveal the general sympathy of the German people for China. We deeply hope that China, after this great disaster, will rise up and, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, build a strong new China, just as our leader Hitler was able to unite the will of the people of Germany, which had been weak for fifteen years, and create a new Germany. Please do not worry, China has been established for thousands of years and will surely continue to exist. What is needed is the ability to unite the strength of the entire nation to seek a way out for the entire nation. Regarding the German-Japanese Agreement, there is no other purpose besides anti-communism. Any political or military alliance or anti-China front plan is not covered by this agreement. Japan cannot, under the pretext of anti-communism, elicit support in Germany for the invasion of China, and Germany will never grant Japan the right to pursue selfish gains in China. On the contrary, Germany actually hopes for the revival of China and especially hopes for a speedy peace. I personally deeply hate the Japanese army's brutality against China, especially against defenceless cities and civilians. This kind of behavior will inevitably lead to swift retribution, for what China is suffering today, other countries may also be unable to avoid in the future. I always have the lovable China in my mind, etc. (17th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Secret Military Weapons Uncovered in Paris</h3>
<p>The Mechanisms Were Ingeniously Constructed; Many Right-Wing Individuals Have Been Arrested</p>
<p>[Paris] A case involving the private storage of a large quantity of military weapons was uncovered here yesterday. The case is extremely important and is currently under investigation. It is generally believed that these military weapons were stored by a secret military organization of the extreme right-wing. After the various extreme right-wing political groups in France were dissolved, the most radical elements among them were unwilling to submit and secretly stored military weapons to plot a rebellion. The matter was discovered by the investigation agency. It was initially discovered that someone was illegally storing military weapons, and then it was discovered that someone was secretly plotting to organize an illegal organization. Finally, a major conspiracy to endanger national security was discovered. Yesterday, the police went to an apartment on Ribera Street in the expensive area of western Paris for a search. The apartment had been converted from a hotel, and a sturdy underground vault was found inside. The vault contained a large quantity of military equipment and ammunition, such as anti-aircraft shells, rifles, machine guns, submachine guns, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. It would take several trucks to transport these military weapons. There was also a secret room in the apartment, which was arranged in an extremely complete and sturdy manner, and equipped with a secret telephone line that could be used as a headquarters. The entrance to the secret room was hidden in the wall, and the mechanism was ingenious, like those described in detective novels. In addition, the investigation department also seized a large quantity of military weapons in an automobile garage on Ambert Street. This morning, 134 rifles, 43 German-made machine guns, 20,000 rounds of ammunition, and leather goods were seized in an antique shop in the Odeon district. The police also made discoveries in the suburbs of Paris and the city of Thiers in the north. So far, many people have been arrested, such as Jomiro, the owner of the apartment on Ribera Street, Count Stel, the manager of the automobile garage on Ambert Street, and an engineer who constructed the secret vault. Regarding this case, the police are taking a cautious attitude, but it is generally expected that there will be important developments. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Paris] In the recent case of uncovering a conspiracy to privately store a large quantity of military weapons and endanger the country, it was found that it was done by the extreme right-wing secret organization, the Cagoule. The police have seized 200 rifles, 500 machine guns, 50 submachine guns, anti-aircraft shells, and countless rounds of ammunition in several locations in Paris and its suburbs, and the city of Thiers. The police are continuing to conduct investigations throughout the country. So far, a total of nine people have been arrested. After private military weapons were seized in an antique shop in the Odeon district, a person named More and Sister Suchana were arrested by the police for being related to the case.

<h3>Tongren Fuyuan Hall Buries Victims' Bodies</h3>
<p>Original Burial Site Obstructed by Traffic; Burial Site Obtained After Several Attempts</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, the Tongren Fuyuan Hall in the French Concession has organized burial teams to depart in batches to the war zones and the southwestern city of Shanghai, Pudong, and the four rural villages, and to collect and bury the bodies of wounded and dead soldiers and bombing victims from the hospitals in the concession. The coffins were transported to the two burial sites in Tangwan and Beicai in Pudong for burial. To date, the number of large and small coffins has reached nearly ten thousand. Since the fall of western and southern Shanghai, traffic between the Chinese Concession and the four rural villages has been cut off. As a result, the hall has been unable to transport and bury the large and small coffins and thin wooden coffins received each month for the past ten days. They have been temporarily stacked on both sides of the hall's morgue, numbering as many as three or four hundred. Furthermore, because they cannot transport coffins from the coffin shop on Qiaojiabang Road in the southern city, the hall is temporarily stacking abandoned corpses of children without coffins, collected from various roads and remote places, in the morgue courtyard, also numbering seventy or eighty. Due to the continuous rainy days, the corpses in the thin wooden coffins are soaked and rotten, emitting a foul odor that hinders hygiene, causing passersby to hesitate. The hall initially planned to transport the stacked large and small coffins to its own dozens of acres of vacant land in the middle section of Route Ghisi for temporary burial, and then rebury them in the Pudong burial site after the war was over. However, although the Public Works Department allowed it, the Health Department refused due to hygiene concerns. As a result, Mr. Ling Bohua, a director of the hall, negotiated with the Health Department of the Public Works Department, requesting that they find a temporary burial site during the period when traffic has not resumed. After repeated discussions lasting four or five days, the number of coffins piled up in front of the hall increased, and the odor became even worse, spreading in the wind, making people want to vomit. The French Public Works Department has identified a vacant plot of land on the east side of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway on Hongqiao Road, west of Xujiahui in western Shanghai, and ordered that all thin wooden coffins be transported there for burial. The ground must be dug seven feet deep. After three years, family members are allowed to claim and move the bodies back, or rebury them. More good quality and superior coffins will be temporarily stacked on another suitable vacant plot. However, the Hongqiao Road area is under the control of enemy forces. The French authorities have negotiated with the enemy and dispatched French personnel to lead and protect the burial work. However, the enemy still ordered the workers to open the coffins for inspection and surveillance the day before yesterday. The hall has hired additional workers and trucks since the day before yesterday to carry out the loading and burial work. However, due to the rainy weather and slippery roads in the past two days, the work has been delayed. On the other hand, they are purchasing wood and hiring craftsmen to build sheds on the old burial site of the Siming Public Association opposite the Sino-French School to rush to make small wooden coffins to prepare for the burial of the accumulated corpses of children. The work will be completed in two days. The smell of rotting corpses in that section can be completely eliminated.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Shipping Route to Be Cut Off</h3>
<p>De Ping Ship Unable to Sail to Ningbo; Route May Be Changed to Zhoushan</p>
<p>The De Ping ship of the China-Italy Shipping Company was scheduled to sail to Zhenhai and Ningbo the day before yesterday. Tickets had been sold, and more than a thousand passengers were waiting on board. However, the Zhenhai Fortress Command has banned ships from entering and exiting the Zhenhai port since the 16th. The China-Italy Company repeatedly telegraphed Zhenhai on the 17th and 18th, requesting permission to pass once more. As of last night, they still had not received a reply, so the De Ping ship was unable to sail out and was docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf. Many passengers were waiting on board. Later, some of them went to the company to refund their tickets yesterday afternoon. According to company sources, if there is no reply from Zhenhai today, the entire Shanghai-Ningbo traffic will be completely cut off and will no longer be able to sail. The De Ping ship will have to change its route to the Zhoushan route.</p>
<h3>Absolute Security in the Concession</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, the British and French Concession authorities have actively stepped up efforts to maintain security within the concession. As a result, general social order has been very good. Even during the past battles, no accidents or disturbances occurred. Although the Shanghai Battle has shifted, the authorities have not slackened their efforts to maintain good social order and are taking more thorough measures to continue to maintain this stable state. Therefore, it is expected that the safety of the concession, under any circumstances, should not be a cause for concern.</p>
<h3>Relief for Homeless Refugees</h3>
<p>City West Federation Distributes Relief Tickets; French Authorities Encourage Refugees to Enter Shelters</p>
<p>Distributing Relief Tickets The Shanghai City West United Benefit Association, in view of the fact that tens of thousands of homeless refugees on the streets have run out of food and cannot be accommodated, has been distributing food along the way in trucks for several days. However, due to the large number of people, the supply is felt to be insufficient. In addition to actively appealing to all walks of life to solicit donations of large quantities of food, it is also believed that distributing food by truck is likely to obstruct traffic order and cause accidents. Therefore, the association has specially printed a type of relief ticket from today, distributing it to refugees on the streets. With the ticket, they can receive ten pieces of food from the association to fill their stomachs. The first batch of 10,000 relief tickets was distributed in less than half a day, totaling 100,000 pieces of food. To save time and effort and avoid all waste, all walks of life can purchase these relief tickets from the association's relief team. Then you can distribute them yourself. Each ticket is temporarily used as a food voucher worth 20 cents in national currency, and more are calculated by analogy. Those who wish to purchase tickets should notify the association by phone at 35627, and someone will be sent to deliver them immediately. If you have donations of items, you can send them to the association at Chengdifang, Gordon Road.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Sleeping Outdoors After the fall of the southern city, the French Concession has a large number of refugees. Although refugee shelters are doing their best to accommodate them, due to the large number of people, there are inevitably omissions. As a result, the refugees sleeping outdoors in various alleys of the French Concession every night are quite crowded, and the continuous rainy days make the refugees look like drowned chickens, prone to disease. The police and health authorities of the French Municipal Council believe that this matter is important. The police department sends out a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives every night to go to the alleys to advise these refugees to go to the shelters to avoid sleeping outdoors and cherish their lives.</p>
<p>Donating Clothing The Shanghai Charity Organization Relief Association, in view of the fact that a large number of refugees who have no home to return to are wandering in various roads and alleys, exposed to the wind and rain, and suffering from hunger and cold, their plight is even worse than that of the refugees in the shelters. According to Zhao Puchu, director of the association's shelter team, 300 to 500 people gather in front of the Renji Hall on 6th Ma Road every day, and they are trying their best to accommodate them. However, there are still many people coming to the association one after another. The weather is getting colder, and the refugees' clothes are thin. I hope that all walks of life will donate more winter clothing, which will be a great merit.</p>
<p>Post Office to Change Office Hours According to postal sources, the Beisuzhou Road Postal Administration has changed its winter office hours from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. since yesterday.</p>

<h3>Statistics on the Number of Refugees in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>More Than 81,000 People</p>
<p>According to a report from the Public Works Department's Health Department, as of the 17th of this month, there were 142 refugee shelters inspected by the department, accommodating a total of 81,750 refugees.</p>
<h3>Active Bond Solicitation During a Time of Turmoil</h3>
<p>Central Bank in Hankou Serves as the General Collection Office; Two Fresh Fish Businesses Each Pledge 2,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The National Salvation Public Bond Solicitation Association and the various solicitation teams are actively carrying out solicitation activities. The association has designated the Central Bank in Hankou as the general collection agency for the national salvation public bonds. The designated banks in this city will continue to collect as before. The Shanghai business community's solicitation team has scheduled the second grand announcement of the results of the various industry teams for the first day of next month. It specially notifies the various industry teams to promptly solicit and deliver the bonds that have been pledged but not yet paid and those that have not been purchased by the 25th of this month, so that they can be reported to the association. Those with excellent results will be reported to the government by the National Salvation Public Bond Solicitation Team for commendation. Furthermore, the Shun Dayuan and Chang two companies in the city's fresh fish industry have been making every effort to dredge and transport fish and vegetables for the people during this time of turmoil, regardless of economic constraints. They each generously pledged 2,000 yuan for the national salvation public bonds, which is especially commendable.</p>
<h3>How the Authorities Should Handle Our Military Personnel Who Retreat into the Concessions</h3>
<p>Future Freedom May Be Possible; About Six Thousand in the Two Concessions</p>
<p>According to a report in the Shanghai Times, the handling of our loyal soldiers, security teams, and police who have retreated into the Public and French Concessions is considered a difficult issue by the authorities of both concessions. The number of soldiers, police, and security teams who have surrendered their weapons and retreated into the two concessions totals six thousand, with only three hundred and fifty in the Public Concession, namely the famous four hundred isolated soldiers who defended Zhabei. The French Concession has a larger number, and its burden is naturally heavier. According to a statement by the Public Concession authorities to the newspaper reporters some days ago, if they can obtain the consent of the Japanese side, the soldiers sheltered in the concessions will be given their freedom as soon as possible. Our country will not object to this arrangement. As the Japanese side has left Shanghai due to the war, it is unlikely that they will create difficulties. However, one fact must be clearly recognized: the Public Concession, by its nature, is a municipal organization, not a sovereign state. In other words, the Public Concession authorities have no obligation to shelter these soldiers until the end of the war. The French Concession authorities probably share this view. We recall that during the last European War, neutral Switzerland sheltered a large number of soldiers from the belligerent countries who crossed into its territory. After the end of the European War, the foreign soldiers sheltered in Switzerland were sent back to their home countries by Switzerland, and the countries to which these soldiers belonged paid for their upkeep. The French Concession authorities have received an informal suggestion regarding the five thousand soldiers who surrendered their weapons and retreated into the concession from Nanshi: a similar approach could be adopted after the war is over. However, one thing makes the situation more complicated: this war is undeclared, and there is no formal declaration of war. This makes the status of the soldiers who have retreated into the concession even more ambiguous. However, as of now, the cost of feeding the soldiers who have retreated into the concession is not a heavy burden for the two concession authorities, because Chinese charitable organizations have donated a large amount of funds. However, this source may become problematic over time.</p>
<h3>Fires in Pudong and Nanshi Not Yet Extinguished</h3>
<p>Two Major Fires in Pudong; Fire in Nanshi Spreads Westward</p>
<p>Pudong: Yesterday, two more fires broke out in the Pudong area. One was near Laiyidu Street Ferry Crossing Middle Road, south of the Post Office and First Floor Teahouse, the very place where the flames had been extinguished on the fifteenth. At eight o'clock in the morning, the fire continued to spread southward, and the flames were very fierce. A thick plume of smoke rose high into the sky and gradually moved south, reaching the intersection of Dongchang Road beyond Laiyidu South Road at around eleven o'clock. It was not extinguished until after noon, destroying more than fifty buildings. The other fire broke out at around nine o'clock in the morning in a private house in Yangjiazhai behind the Pudong Branch Office of the Public Security Bureau. The flames burst through the roof and spread in all directions, burning until around eleven o'clock, when more than thirty bungalows were reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>Nanshi: After the fall of Nanshi, large fires broke out everywhere, raging for six days and nights without any sign of stopping. At around eight o'clock last night, the fire was very fierce near Longhua on Xietu Road. The extent of the damage remains to be investigated. West of Xieqiao, the fires along Luban Road and Xuxu Road were the most intense. The shops and residential houses on both sides of Luban Road to Liyuan Road, as well as the Tan and Li family residences, were all reduced to ashes. Large stores such as Da Lai Native Produce Store and Wan He Tai Incense Candle Store were all burned to the ground.</p>
<p>The fire at Anlan Road and Fangxie Road outside the West Gate was the worst the day before yesterday afternoon. At night, the red light filled the sky and the flames raged wildly. The fires in smaller areas such as Menghua Street and Xieqiao were relatively smaller. By yesterday morning, the fire on Anlan Road had burned almost completely, and white smoke was now rising. The fire site covered a vast area, connecting to the previously burned Lujiabang Road through the nearby Fangxie Road, Xilin Heng Road, Da Lin Road, Da Ji Road, and the middle section of Lin Yin Road, a desolate and shocking sight. Half of the houses in the Shangwen Road area were burned. The Great South Gate, due to the burning of the telephone bureau, turned Jiangyin Street on the west end and Tangfang Lane behind the Foguo Pavilion on the east end of Xiaonanmen into ashes. All the corpses that had been killed in recent days, about two or three hundred, were thrown into the flames to be burned in lieu of burial. At around nine o'clock yesterday morning, a fire broke out again near the South Wharf, burning fiercely. There were two outbreaks, one at the Xuejiabang pig trade wharf and rice wharf, and the other near Ping'an Bridge. The fire was still burning at noon.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Harbour Bureau Forecasts Two High Tides Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Harbour Bureau's tidal forecast states that there will be two high tides in December. The first will be from December 1st to 5th, with the highest being 10 feet 6.5 inches at 1:01 PM on December 4th. The second will be from December 17th to 20th, with the highest at 10:20 PM on the 20th, at 11 feet 4 inches. After this, the tide in the Huangpu River will decrease.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cotton Mills in Shanghai's West District Plan to Resume Production</h3>
<p>Lack of Workers; No Date Set for Reopening</p>
<p>Since the war has moved away from Shanghai, the Japanese cotton mills in the Public Concession area are reportedly planning to resume production as the Japanese residents who left Shanghai are gradually returning. However, they are finding it difficult to reopen due to the shortage of workers and will use White Russians instead.</p>
<h3>International Relief Committee Launches One-Cent Campaign</h3>
<p>In order to expand the Daily One-Cent Campaign, the International Relief Committee specially printed and distributed a prospectus yesterday to promote it widely. The following is an excerpt: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the number of refugees has reached 300,000. Although various charitable organizations have tried their best to provide relief, the number of people is large and the supplies are enormous. We hope that enthusiastic people in the community will do their best to help. Now, we are soliciting donations for this One-Cent Campaign in accordance with the proposal of the Wartime Service Corps of the insurance industry (the method was reported yesterday). Gathering sand into a tower and collecting fur into a robe, we only hope that kind people from all walks of life will consider the suffering of the disaster victims, generously open their purses, and enthusiastically help. We are immensely grateful. Please submit donations to the office of the YMCA at Ba Xian Qiao, and receipts will be issued. However, this committee will not send personnel to solicit donations, so please be aware.</p>
<h3>Fewer Monks Than Gruel; Foreign Exchange Market Tightens</h3>
<p>Forward Rates Higher Than Spot Rates; Swap Interest Rates Suddenly Rise</p>
<p>Since the foreign exchange market showed changes last week, the trend has become even tighter in the past week. Although the Central Bank once sold spot pounds to regulate the market, in recent days, the situation has gradually become one of "fewer monks than gruel". The reason is that various foreign firms are absorbing them non-stop, and the large US dollar settlement of Mobil Oil further depletes the foreign exchange market. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, formal pound transactions were as tight as 1 shilling 2 15625 pence, and the US dollar was 29.4375 yuan. Due to the lack of hedge and the demand of people's hearts, the forward market is even tighter than the spot market. In December, the pound exchange rate once tightened to 1 shilling 1 8125 pence, and the US dollar to 28.8125 yuan, but there was no suitable transaction. The swap spread is much larger than in the past. It is estimated that the difference between the pound from November to December is 25, and the US dollar is 53125. If you buy in November and sell out in December, you can get a monthly interest of 1.8%, which is an astonishingly high interest rate. The closing price of the market yesterday afternoon was: spot pound 1 shilling 2.25 pence, November 125, December 1 shilling 1.875 pence, spot US dollar 29.5 yuan, November 40625, December 28.875 yuan. As for the exchange rates quoted by the Central Bank and HSBC, the pound and the US dollar are still unchanged as in the past.</p>

<h3>Regulations for Granting Subsidies to Private Schools by the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Approved by the Board of Directors</p>
<p>At a meeting held on the 5th of this month, the Education Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council considered the issue of the third installment of subsidies for Chinese private schools within the settlement for the current year. According to a report from the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, there are currently 127 private schools receiving subsidies in the Central and Western Districts. Among them, 58 schools have been deemed to have satisfactory results and should be allowed to receive subsidies. Four schools have followed the instructions of the Health Department and have started to improve. Two schools, whose original sites have been converted into refugee hospitals, have moved to temporary school sites, and their situation has also been temporarily deemed satisfactory and should be allowed to receive subsidies. The remaining 63 schools, either have not complied with the Council's intention to improve facilities, or have long since moved, or have indeed closed down, and their due subsidies have all been suspended. Before the outbreak of the war, there were 88 schools in the Northeast and East Districts. Among them, 10 schools had been inspected before the war and deemed satisfactory. Now, they may have moved to other places to start school, or are preparing to start school, or have sent their students to other private schools receiving subsidies to borrow classes. These schools, if not due to the war, should be able to receive subsidies, so the third installment of subsidies should still be issued.</p>
<p>There are a total of 21 schools with unclear information, and 6 schools that are known to have closed down. These schools should be able to receive subsidies based on their situation at their original school sites before August 13 of this year. Whether these 27 schools, together with another 5 schools that had started to improve sanitary facilities before the war but whose information is now unclear, should be allowed to receive subsidies should be given special consideration. In addition, there are 9 schools whose original school buildings were not entirely satisfactory before the war, but have now found new school sites to start school, and the new school buildings are considered satisfactory. Therefore, the Education Committee may as well allow them to receive subsidies. The remaining 37 schools in the Northeast and East Districts have not complied with the conditions set by the Council for improvement and should not be allowed to receive subsidies.</p>
<p>The Chief of the Finance Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council gave his opinion on the subsidy issue. The Chief said that under normal circumstances, the facilities of each school must meet the conditions set by the Council's various departments, and they must start school in early September. At that time, the number of students must be practically the same as the number in the spring before they can receive the third installment of subsidies. Although the student numbers can be somewhat flexible, they cannot be completely ignored. If any school starts school in full before the end of September, and the number of students is more than two-thirds of the number in the spring, then the third installment of subsidies should be paid as usual. If the number of students in the autumn is less than two-thirds of the number in the spring, then the subsidies should be reduced proportionally. If the class time is only half a day, the subsidies should also be reduced.</p>
<p>After reviewing the above reports and opinions, the members of the Education Committee discussed in detail the conditions for receiving subsidies, especially the number of students attending classes and the half-day class system. According to the Committee, the number of students attending Chinese primary schools in the settlement is about one-quarter of the usual number, and the number of students attending middle schools is about 60%. The number of students at Western schools on November 1 was about one-third. It was also learned that the tuition fees of the subsidized schools had been reduced by half after the outbreak of the war. After discussion, the Committee decided to submit the following recommendations to the Board of Directors: ⑴ For Chinese schools that have started school in satisfactory school buildings, and whose number of students is more than half of the former number, regardless of the amount of class time, except for those whose teaching equipment is obviously imperfect, it is proposed to allow them to receive the entire third installment of subsidies for this year. ⑵ For those who have started school in satisfactory school buildings, but whose number of students attending school is less than half of the usual number, it is proposed to allow them to receive half of the subsidies. ⑶ For other schools, if the war does not drag on, they would have been eligible to receive all or part of the first and second installments of subsidies for this year, but have not been able to receive them. Whether they should be issued now will be considered separately after the Council's various departments submit reports to the Committee's next meeting, depending on the circumstances of each school.</p>
<p>The above recommendations were adopted by the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council at its meeting on the 17th of this month.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Vegetables Arrive in Shanghai in First Batch; Prices Expected to Fall Today</h3>
<p>Future Supplies Can Be Shipped from Various Places to Shanghai; Vegetables Also for Sale in Pudong</p>
<p>Vegetable prices have continued to soar in recent days. Local produce traders telegraphed Shandong last week to purchase vegetables for shipment to Shanghai. It is now known that the first batch arrived on the steamer from Jinan at 2:00 PM yesterday. The steamer transported a large number of various vegetables and fruits, such as cabbage, turnips, and apples, from Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao. After arriving in Shanghai, they were picked up by various freight companies and will be available on the market today. Prices are expected to fall. It is reported that Shanghai's local produce traders have placed very large orders for vegetables from Shandong, and they can all be shipped to Shanghai this month. In addition, after the Shanghai Municipal Council negotiated with the Japanese side, villagers have gone to Pudong to purchase vegetables. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter saw countless farmers carrying vegetables to Puxi at the New Customs Wharf. Many vegetable vendors were waiting at the wharf. After the farmers carried the vegetables to the wharf, they were snatched up.</p>
<h3>Heartless Pickpockets Steal Rice Money</h3>
<p>Bullying Refugee Children; Truly Outrageous</p>
<p>After the relocation of our troops from the four suburban areas of Shanghai, citizens with some wealth, fearing that transportation would be disrupted and there would be a shortage of rice, rushed to purchase and store rice, causing retail rice shops to sell out. Most of the impoverished and suffering compatriots did not get a grain of rice. In order to alleviate this panic, the Shanghai Municipal Council, etc., on the one hand, tried to open up sources, and on the other hand, distributed tens of thousands of piculs of stored foreign rice to various rice shops, specializing in selling to the poor, and limited each person to a maximum purchase of one yuan, in order to make it universal. The method is very good. Unexpectedly, a gang of heartless pickpockets took the opportunity to move around, impersonating rice buyers, carrying rice bags, etc., and mixed into the poor people buying rice everywhere, stealing money. Therefore, in recent days, there have been reports of thefts at the entrances of rice shops in various places, especially among men, women, and children, crying loudly, which is heartbreaking. The day before yesterday afternoon, inside the rope enclosure at the entrance of Shunfeng Rice Shop at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Changsha Road, there were refugee children, one male and one female, about eleven or twelve years old, each carrying a lead bucket in one hand and holding a one-yuan banknote in the other, crowded in the crowd. A pickpocket next to them told the children that the banknotes should be hidden in the bag and the lead bucket should be placed on their heads to avoid being crushed. A boy did as he was told, and soon the one-yuan banknote in the bag disappeared. A girl pretended to put the banknote in the bag, but secretly held it in her hand. After a while, the pickpocket reached into the girl's bag to try and find it but could not. Because the girl was small and could be bullied, the pickpocket dared to make a loud noise and asked why she hadn't put the banknote in the bag. The girl knew that things were not good, so she ran out of the rope enclosure and went home, telling her family to rush over, but the thief knew that the opportunity was not good and had already slipped away. It is hoped that rice buyers will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Charitable Organizations Jointly Plan to Borrow Money</h3>
<p>Borrow 200,000 Yuan from the Four Banks; Lin Kanghou Appointed to Negotiate</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Charitable Organizations in this city, due to the need for a large amount of funds for disaster relief matters in recent days, has specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the four banks of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and China Farmers' Bank to borrow 200,000 yuan. The Ministry of Finance replied that they should directly negotiate with the four banks. Yesterday, the association specially appointed Mr. Lin Kanghou to negotiate with the four banks.</p>
<h3>The Truth Behind the Bathtub Female Corpse Case Comes to Light</h3>
<p>Originally a Case of Jealousy; Shi Shengqi Wanted by Police</p>
<p>Shen Yuzhen, the wife of Huang Weiyuan, the owner of the Meli Raisin Company at No. 13, Lane 296, Gongguanma Road, French Concession, was murdered by Shi Shengqi, a Jiading native who had ceased to be a partner, in Room 201 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road on the 3rd of this month. At that time, Shi forged a note in the room to indicate that the woman had committed suicide. However, after an investigation by Detective Zhang Yuanjing of the Lao Zha Police Station, it was recognized that the note was written by Huang Kejia, a Jiading native who had worked at the Meli Company and had left. Therefore, Huang was summoned to the police station, and after comparing the handwriting, it was clear that the note was written by Huang, so he was immediately detained. However, Huang resolutely denied participating in the case and was sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. During the adjournment, after strict interrogation by the detectives, Huang confessed the details. It turned out that Huang Shen Yuzhen had been having an affair with Shi Shengqi, a shop assistant. Later, Huang found out and stopped Shi from working there two years ago. Shen then transferred her affection to Huang Kejia, and they had relations three times. Unexpectedly, Huang Weiyuan found out about it and stopped Huang from working there again in August of this year. After that, Huang Kejia and Shen met at the home of Si Hunbu You. Huang even borrowed 90 yuan from You. On the 2nd of this month, Huang Kejia suddenly received a note from Shi Shengqi, inviting him to Room 201 of the Central Hotel. In the evening, Huang went as agreed and saw Shi and Shen together. She was only wearing a short shirt and pants. Later, Shi asked her to hide temporarily in the bathroom and told Huang that the woman was naturally promiscuous and had affairs with many people, so he wanted to kill her. He also asked Huang to write a note (the suicide note) and then asked the woman to come out. Shi was seen setting a towel around her neck and dragging her into the bedroom. Huang thought they were just playing at the time. When he entered the bedroom, he saw that she was already dead. Shi asked Huang to help move the body to the bathroom, and Huang was so frightened that he fled. The detectives brought Huang to the room, and Huang described the situation in detail and wrote a statement. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court, and the police lawyers Ru Bao Yi, Li Zhishan, and Chen Ming explained the situation and prosecuted him for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered an adjournment for further interrogation. This suspicious case was finally completely clarified as a result of jealousy. The police station is now strictly arresting Shi Shengqi.</p>
<h3>Do Not Buy Items of Unknown Origin</h3>
<p>To Avoid Unexpected Losses</p>
<p>In recent days, many unscrupulous people have been found in the Nanshi area, looting people's property in various places and stealing building materials from people's houses, and then transporting them to the concessions for sale, trying to make a profit. There have been many cases that have been discovered by various parties. Therefore, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will not buy goods of unknown origin in the future, in order to avoid unexpected losses.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West United Relief Association Distributes Food to Refugees</h3>
<p>Over 40,000 Items Received Yesterday; Many Westerners Donate</p>
<p>The Shanghai West United Relief Association received over 45,000 items of donated food from all walks of life yesterday, all of which have been distributed to refugees. In addition to receiving 48.75 yuan from the people of Sullivan Candy Factory, Mr. Cujun, a Westerner from the factory, donated 5 yuan, Rowan Sigan and Kockerson donated 2 yuan each, and Mr. Lei Chai donated 1 yuan, which is commendable.

<h3>Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau Closes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is an agency that inspects ships, handles registration, and protects navigation safety. Therefore, it has a committee to deal with incidents such as collisions between ships during navigation, to seek fair resolutions. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, the bureau has made many facilities for regulating inland river navigation. Due to changes in the war situation and the obstruction of inland river routes, the bureau has been ordered by the ministry to temporarily close all its affairs from today.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Tongzhou Line Opens; Passengers and Goods Crowded</h3>
<p>Endeavour to Join the Line Starting Today</p>
<p>Steamers operating on the Shanghai-Tongzhou line, such as the English Taikoo's Wuhu and Wuxue and Jardine Matheson's Pinghe, are very crowded with passengers every time they travel to and from Shanghai. Tickets must be purchased in advance for the next sailing. As for goods, most of them are being shipped to various ports along the Yangtze River. Due to the limited tonnage of each ship and the large amount of goods, the shipping companies are temporarily allocating the loading. In addition, the Italian firm China Navigation Company's Endeavour will join the line starting today. Passenger tickets have already been sold out and are scheduled to depart at 8:00 AM today.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Blows Towards Japan</h3>
<p>The hurricane that occurred at the Zhenhai port the day before yesterday turned rapidly yesterday and crossed the Zhoushan Islands into the sea. At 6:00 AM, the center of the hurricane swept across Huanao Mountain and moved towards the northeast east. At 4:00 PM, according to the suspended sphere report from the Yangjingbang Meteorological Observatory, it had reached between 31 degrees north latitude and 127 degrees east longitude, located in the East China Sea and only 400 kilometers from Japan, still blowing towards the northeast east.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Anglo-German Diplomatic Talks</h3>
<p>— Advisable</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Halifax and German leader Hitler will hold important diplomatic talks in Berlin today. It is said that the scope of issues to be discussed is very broad, including the Anti-Comintern Pact and the Western European Treaty. Recently, German newspapers have also been spreading the idea of recovering former German colonies. It seems that this issue will also be brought up for discussion. This diplomatic talk not only indicates that Britain and Germany are making efforts to improve their national relations, but its nature is also related to the global situation. It goes without saying that this is worthy of close attention.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the consistent policy of the British Empire is to maintain the balance of power in the world. The rise of Germany after the war owes much to British assistance. In recent years, Germany and Italy have been actively expanding their influence, shaking the European situation. Britain has had to further unite with France. However, this policy of Britain not only fails to maintain world stability, but also makes the international situation increasingly unfavorable to itself. It is now very clear that in Europe, Italy is intent on hindering British hegemony in the Mediterranean, and in the Far East, Japan is intent on encroaching on British interests in China. The establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact has further increased the arrogance of Japan and Italy. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that the British government is considering wooing Germany again. As I guess, the main purpose of this trip to Berlin by the British Foreign Secretary is probably to exchange some concessions to Germany for a guarantee of stable world situation. This is because there are contradictions between Germany, Italy, and Japan. If Italy and Japan do not get the support of Germany, their power to cause trouble will be greatly reduced. Even so, Germany's desires are not easy to satisfy. It is feared that it will be difficult for Britain to achieve much in this diplomatic talk.</p>

<h3>The Situation in Jiaxing is Tense; Our Heavy Troops Provide Support and Resolutely Resist</h3>
<p>Our Side Holds a Relatively Advantageous Position in the Southern District of Yangcheng Lake. Our Powerful Troops Launch Fierce Counterattacks in the Wujiang Area. Enemy Troops in Taicang Have Collapsed and Are Expected to Be Recaptured Tonight.</p>
<p>The frontline battles in recent days have been extremely fierce, especially in the Jiaxing area, where the enemy has launched a full-scale offensive. Our troops are resisting desperately, advancing and retreating repeatedly, and both sides have suffered extremely heavy losses. Along the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway line, between Zhengyi and Weiting, our side is using the natural terrain to defend itself with water as a barrier, holding a relatively advantageous position. Although the enemy has mechanized units, they are difficult to move due to the rain and mud. Our troops have the advantage of both favorable timing and terrain, and we are confident in the future of the war of resistance. According to the battle situation obtained this afternoon, the reports are as follows: ㊀ Enemy ships are densely deployed on the Fukuyama River surface, as many as sixty or seventy, constantly shelling the shore and flanking our left wing, Changshu frontline positions. The battle near Wangjiangjing is tense. After days of heavy bombardment by the enemy, fortifications have been destroyed, and there are reports that our troops have retreated to the southern district of Yangcheng Lake. ㊁ Our troops in the southern district of Yangcheng Lake are holding the danger points and have a strong force, so there is no need to worry. A senior general personally inspected the battle zone yesterday, greatly boosting morale. ㊂ The main force of the enemy had previously approached Wujiang. Our side, after receiving reinforcements from powerful troops, launched a fierce counterattack and has already lifted the siege. ㊃ There are rumors that Jiaxing is tense, but according to information from a certain source, our heavy troops are still holding the southeast sides of the city, resisting bravely. Reinforcements are also arriving one after another. A major battle is about to begin, and the enemy will definitely not succeed.</p>
<h3>Intense Battles Near Jiaxing; We Have Heavy Troops Stationed There to Defend It</h3>
<p>Military intelligence indicates that the enemy has been making every effort to attack our Jiaxing very urgently in recent days. However, after our troops bravely intercepted them, they retreated to the Qiliqiao and Tangwanzhen areas and are holding their ground against our troops. Currently, the enemy is combining forces from the Wangjiangjing area, intending to outflank Jiaxing's rear. At the same time, they are attempting to attack Wujiang along the Sujia Road (Suzhou-Jiaxing Road). However, after our troops raided Pingwang, the enemy troops on that road seem to have suffered significant losses. Recently, fierce mixed battles have occurred near Jiaxing. However, we have heavy troops stationed there, sufficient for prolonged defense. Even if the enemy has ambitions, they will have to pay a heavy price.</p>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency reports that regarding Jiaxing, our side planned to outflank the enemy from Hailan and Haining but failed. The enemy repeatedly attacked Jiaxing's front line from Jiashan and attempted to seize the east side of Jiaxing from Pingwang and Wangjiangjing. Our ××× division used an "inducing" tactic to fiercely attack and kill the enemy. Enemy reconnaissance teams fell into our encirclement and were completely wiped out. Their cavalry repeatedly attacked along the railway line, but ultimately failed.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Attack on Fushan is Very Fierce</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 19th – Reuters dispatch: According to Chinese sources, the Japanese troops who landed at Hupukou are now attacking Fushan fiercely. At the same time, Japanese troops are attacking the Chinese army at Zhengyi along the Jinghu Railway line. The Chinese army there is gradually retreating to the south of Yangcheng Lake.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops in Taicang Are Collapsing; We Can Recapture the City Tonight</h3>
<p>According to front-line battle reports, enemy troops in the Taicang area suddenly retreated from the front line last night and this morning, totaling more than 2,200 men. They fled into Taicang City, and there are still some remnants of the enemy who are retreating in panic to Yuewang City. Our army is currently tracking and pursuing them, advancing towards Taicang. It is expected that the city can be recaptured tonight.</p>
<h3>More Than 5,000 Enemy Troops Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>This morning (19th) at 8:00 AM, five enemy transport ships successively sailed into Shanghai: No. 402 transport ship Sun Maru, No. 198 transport ship Ryoshun Maru, transport ship Ume Maru No. 292, transport ship Karafuto Maru No. 394, transport ship Sansho Maru, and the transport ship Ujina Maru (number unknown). They berthed at the Huangpu, Osaka, Huishan, and Qiujiang wharves, carrying the eleventh batch of the seventh wave of enemy reinforcements, approximately 5,000 men. They immediately disembarked and headed to the front lines.</p>
<h3>Civilian Boats Anchored in the Suzhou Creek Are All Forcibly Requisitioned by the Enemy</h3>
<p>A total of more than 200 boats; all the boat owners have fled. The purpose is to transport military supplies and build pontoon bridges.</p>
<p>The civilian boats anchored in the Suzhou Creek have been used to transport goods from the mainland to Shanghai for sale. However, due to the sudden order for our garrison in Zhabei to withdraw, these civilian boats could not sail out and were trapped inside, totaling more than 200 boats. The creek was full of masts and hulls, densely packed and impassable. Later, the Shanghai Municipal Council managed to arrange parking, and the waterway has now been cleared. However, those coming and going are entirely enemy military transport launches and requisitioned barges, heading upstream to supply military needs. According to inquiries from our agency reporter, because the enemy's front line has been extended and reinforcements are frequent, but the rivers and streams in the interior are crisscrossed and the water is shallow, making deep-water transportation difficult, the enemy has forcibly requisitioned more than 200 civilian boats and small steamers docked in the Suzhou Creek from the Waibaidu Bridge to the Niyu Bridge. The enemy soldiers have already entered the boats yesterday evening with two small boats and a dozen soldiers, recording the ship's brands, numbers, and load-bearing capacity for use. Now, the boat owners are moving their luggage and belongings to the shore, and the boat owners have all fled, unwilling to be driven by the enemy. However, the enemy's purpose in forcibly requisitioning civilian boats is not only to transport military supplies to the front but also to build pontoon bridges for sneak crossings.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Transport Military Supplies and Food</h3>
<p>This morning (19th) at 9:00 AM, seven more enemy transport ships sailed into Shanghai: the Fifth Unkai Maru, Transport Ship No. 41 Katsuragisan Maru, No. 349 Seikyo Maru, Transport Ship No. 140 Ehime Maru, the Sixth Dairyu Maru, Transport Ship No. 418 Shinno Maru, and Transport Ship Lushan Maru (number unknown). They berthed at the Qiujiang, Osaka, Huishan, China Merchants, Huazhan, and New Huishan wharves, carrying large quantities of military supplies and food, which are currently being unloaded. As for the enemy transport ships that have arrived in Shanghai in recent days but have not yet sailed out—namely, the Chikugo Maru, Shinsho Maru, Hagato Maru, and Kayo Maru—they are berthed at the Huishan, North China Merchants Bureau, Central China Merchants Bureau, and New Huishan wharves, respectively, and are continuing to unload military supplies and food.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Bombed the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway This Morning</h3>
<p>Our Troops Fired Back</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] This morning, Japanese aircraft bombed the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, which is located in British territory. Residents in Shenzhen, outside the border, heard the sound of bombs exploding and the sound of machine guns fired by the Chinese army at Japanese aircraft very clearly. Details of the damage are not yet known. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>New Japanese Warship Launched</h3>
<p>⊙Yokosuka The Uraga Dock Company launched the Japanese Navy's first-class destroyer "Kasumi" at 4:00 PM on the 18th, with Commander Hyakutake in attendance. The ship is 108.55 meters long, 10.15 meters wide, has a displacement of 1,500 tons, a speed of 34 knots per hour, and is equipped with six 12.7 cm caliber guns and eight torpedo launchers.

<h3>French Foreign Minister Reports to Parliament on the Outcome of the Brussels Conference</h3>
<p>The British Upper House Continues to Debate Foreign Policy. Ambassador Yoshida Meets with Eden for Lengthy Talks.</p>
<p>[Paris] Foreign Minister Delbos attended the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon to report on the international situation. Delbos reported in detail on the Brussels Conference and also explained France's attitude toward the Far East conflict. Delbos declared that he did not agree with the proposal to entrust the resolution of the Far East conflict to the League of Nations. He insisted that the adjustment of this matter should still be the responsibility of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty that convened the Brussels Conference. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>[London] When the British Upper House resumed its debate on foreign affairs today, former Lord Chancellor Sankey and former Conservative Party Chairman Stonehaven both advocated deleting Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant (i.e., concerning sanctions). Labor Party Backston also advocated making concessions on the restoration of Germany's old colonies, saying that if this principle were recognized, the issue of reorganizing the situation could be freely discussed. The Germans are well aware of the difficulties in Tanganyika, formerly part of German East Africa. He believes that the Germans have higher hopes for West Africa. Air Minister Swinton replied on behalf of the government that what is needed now is prudent discussion. If Parliament requests the government to provide detailed explanations of British policy and procedures, it will not help achieve a complete resolution. Lord Privy Seal Halifax is very capable of conveying people's thoughts, but he sincerely hopes that the people of the country will not have extravagant expectations for his trip to Berlin. Reckless speech would harm the negotiations. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>[London] Japanese Ambassador to Britain Yoshida visited Foreign Secretary Eden on the afternoon of the 17th and discussed important issues for about an hour. Although the content of their meeting has not been disclosed, Ambassador Yoshida said that in view of the transition of the conference, Britain would not go in other directions. He also explained in detail Japan's determination towards China and future policies in order to correct misperceptions. Foreign Secretary Eden seemed to have raised various doubts and hopes regarding the above explanations. The significance of their talks on a major turning point in the Chinese situation is profound. It seems that the British government is also quite concerned about how to end the Brussels Conference without losing face. US representative Davis is afraid that the US will be confused by isolation at home and avoided going to London during the recess, only sending staff. Therefore, there is little expectation for future meetings. (Domei News Agency, 17th)</p>
<h3>Preliminary Talks on Anglo-American Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Based on the Principle of Reciprocity; Considerable Progress Has Been Made</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the negotiation of a trade agreement between Britain and the United States, Prime Minister Chamberlain recently stated in the House of Commons that the informal preliminary talks that have been conducted have made considerable progress, and formal negotiations will begin in a short period of time. At the same time, US Secretary of State Hull also issued a similar statement. Parliamentarians here have been deeply impressed by this matter, believing that at a time when the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has failed to mediate, the issuance of this statement by Britain and the United States has significant political implications. In economic terms, the volume of foreign trade between Britain and the United States is the largest of any country, and the trade agreement that both parties have concluded is naturally of great importance. (Havas, Central News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the negotiation of a trade agreement between Britain and the United States, well-informed sources here recently stated that formal negotiations will begin in six to eight weeks, and the trade agreement will be signed in mid-March next year. Generally, the United States will ask the British government to generally reduce import tariffs on American goods but may accept lower import tariffs on goods from British dominions than on American goods. If so, there will be no difficulties for the dominions. When Britain and the United States conduct talks in the future, each dominion will only be contacted by Britain. However, it is not impossible for each dominion to wish to conduct talks with the United States at the same time or afterward. (Havas, Central News Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>German Political and Military Circles Host Jiang Baili</h3>
<p>Expressing Sympathy for Our Country's War of Resistance; Encouraging Each Other to Maintain Good Neighborliness</p>
<p>[Berlin] The Jia Country Research Association, which promotes Sino-German cooperation, hosted a banquet today for General Jiang Baili, special envoy of Chairman Jiang, member of the Chinese National Defense Council, and invited Cheng Tianfang, the Chinese Ambassador to Germany, Tan Boyu, the counselor of the embassy, and other staff members to accompany him. The German side attending the reception included Du Muller, the German Minister of Transportation who had been in China for a long time, General Weizier, the former military advisor to Nanjing, Major General Meng Qun, head of the overseas branch of the National Socialist Party, and many other senior German officials. Rear Admiral Leitz gave a welcoming speech, first recounting General Jiang's visit to Germany last year, and then stating that there are countless friends in Germany who sincerely sympathize with China in this struggle for national survival. No matter what the future holds, in short, China has achieved national unity in this difficult and dangerous time, which is worthy of glory, and the heroic resistance of the Chinese army has been admired by the whole world. Jiang then gave a response speech, first expressing his gratitude for the grand banquet, and then pointing out that Sino-German relations have always been very friendly. This friendship, Jiang said, should be continued to support the future of China and Germany. Jiang then raised his glass and declared that his only toast was "to maintain German-Chinese friendship."

<h3>London Journalists' Church Holds Memorial Service for Stephens</h3>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Embassies Send Representatives to Participate</p>
<p>[London] A memorial service was held today at the Journalists' Church to commemorate Stephens, a special correspondent for the London Daily Mail who was shot and killed by Japanese troops on November 11 while observing the battle from a water tower in the French Concession of Shanghai. In addition to sending wreaths, the Chinese and Japanese Ambassadors to Britain both sent representatives to the meeting, and the military attaches of the Japanese Embassy also participated. The newspaper's editor-in-chief and heads of various departments all attended the memorial service. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>American Isolationists Become Active Again</h3>
<p>[Washington] Since Congress reconvened recently, isolationists have become active again. This can be seen from the fact that Senators La Follette (a senator from Wisconsin, belonging to the Progressive Party) and Capper (a senator from Kansas, belonging to the Republican Party) jointly proposed a bill to amend the Constitution to require a popular vote to decide on a declaration of war. In the minds of these people, the United States has been bound after participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Now that this conference has failed, if it is decided to take coercive action against Japan in the future, the United States will inevitably be forced to participate. The remote cause of isolationism can be found in the First World War. Most Americans still believe that the US participation in the war was due to the instigation of the allied countries and the pressure of domestic financial groups, which was a big mistake. The American middle class is also suspicious of the European situation and international issues. In addition, the struggle between the White House and Congress for the power to make decisions on national affairs also occurs from time to time. This is a recent cause of isolationist disturbances. Under these circumstances, the State Department feels difficulties, and it must be more cautious in dealing with various international issues. It can be asserted that if isolationist activities continue unabated, President Roosevelt may issue another declaration clarifying his foreign policy. (Havas, Central News Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>British Lord Privy Seal Visits Hitler</h3>
<p>Bearing a Major Mission</p>
<p>[Berlin] After arriving here yesterday, British Lord Privy Seal Halifax, accompanied by German Foreign Minister Neurath, went to Munich at 9:30 tonight. It is estimated that they will arrive tomorrow morning and then transfer to Berchtesgaden to meet with Führer Hitler and have lunch with the Führer. They are scheduled to return to Berlin that evening and stay until the 22nd of this month before returning to the country. (Havas, Central News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the political importance of Lord Halifax's visit to Germany, the newspapers here are still silent and do not comment. Only the "National Socialist News" stated that 25 years of misunderstanding cannot be translated in one simple conversation. Therefore, Halifax's visit is only the beginning of an upward trend in relations between the two countries, or a search for a failure. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japan Denies Issuing Ultimatum to France Over Nanshi</h3>
<p>Protesting Arms Shipments to China</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding rumors that the Japanese government has issued an ultimatum to the French government over the continued shipment of arms from Vietnam to China, stating that if such arms shipments are not stopped, Japan will occupy Hainan Island and certain Vietnamese ports, the Japanese Embassy here has once again denied it. At the same time, according to information obtained here, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French Senate, Béranger, also denied that he had mentioned the word "ultimatum" in his remarks yesterday about arms shipments to China. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>Nanshi Will Have Police to Maintain Order</h3>
<p>The great fire in Nanshi, which started the night before, has completely destroyed all of Sipaillou. There was still a residual fire yesterday afternoon. The order in Nanshi is currently extremely chaotic. It is rumored that a traitor has set up an office at the site of the former District Court, and anyone who wants to enter Nanshi must first pay a fee of two yuan to that place and receive a pass issued by the traitor. As a result, there is a large group of rogues and thugs who go to negotiate, so they can rob and bully good people. It is now known that the Japanese army does not approve of this kind of action by these people. It is heard that it will be possible to pass through in a week, and police without weapons will be organized to maintain order to avoid a situation of terror. It is heard that preparations are being made to recruit former staff members of the District Court who have retreated to the French Concession to return to work.</p>
<h3>It is Difficult to Form Puppet Maintenance Associations in the Towns of Pudong</h3>
<p>After the enemy occupied Pudong for a week, they have gradually felt that it is a burden. Not only is a portion of the military force being diverted to defend various places, but they are also stretched thin. The traitors who are currently active are mostly people who worked in Japanese factories and warehouses in the past. They have no ability to rally people, and their sole purpose is to seek money, so they are worthless. Therefore, they are trying to establish puppet maintenance associations in various towns. In the Yangsiqiao area, a Mr. Zhang is carrying out the plan. In Tangqiao Town, it is impossible to find anyone because the residents are scattered. In Yangjiadu, only one or two out of ten residents remain in the Laiyidu area. However, the enemy believes that these two places are important towns along the Pudong, so they must be decorated. Mr. Chen, Mr. Wang, and the daughter-in-law of ××× are helping the enemy to find people. There are rumors that a Mr. Huang, who owns a barge, has been appointed as the director of the maintenance association. The enemy believes that he has no qualifications, so he is being eliminated. As a result, the rumor that a Mr. Li will take over is very prevalent. However, Mr. Li has high aspirations and is avoiding Shanghai, unmoved. The enemy has no choice but to find someone else in the hope of succeeding soon, so that they can remove the defense responsibility and transfer troops to supplement the front line. However, this hope may be dashed.</p>
<h3>Salt Smuggler Pan A'mei Actually Serves as the Puppet Magistrate of Fengxian County</h3>
<p>A Heinous Criminal Who Was Once Imprisoned</p>
<p>Since the enemy troops landed at Jinshanzui, all the cities and towns south of the Huangpu River have fallen. That area is the essence of Jiangsu Province, free from floods and droughts, and has always been known as fertile land. Once the enemy cavalry roamed freely, burning and plundering, the houses were destroyed. The prosperous cities and towns of the past have become broken tiles and ruins. Most of the people have been displaced. Recently, there has been talk of Pan Meiting being the puppet magistrate of Fengxian County, and he actually openly posted announcements, which can be said to be extremely ridiculous. This Mr. Pan's original name was Pan Mei, later changed to Pan Mei. He is from Shanyang Town, Songjiang County. Because of his humble origins, people call him Pan A'mei. He used to specialize in selling smuggled salt, and then he took advantage of connections to serve as a private salt suppression assistant. He is illiterate and stubborn, and people call him "Crazy Bull." Later, he was dismissed for suppressing private salt smuggling. After serving his sentence, he sought to gain the position of battalion commander of the private salt suppression camp. During the rebellion of Hu Hui Taibao A Shu in the past, he secretly provided assistance. Later, he was found to have assisted the private salt smuggling boss Xiao Pangzi in selling smuggled salt, and shots were fired and people were injured by the private salt suppression ship at the Desheng Port in Ye Xie Town. After investigation, it was confirmed that Pan was the instigator, and he was dismissed and sentenced to more than four years in prison. He was released after smoothing things over in the prison. Recently, he served as the sea patrol team, with jurisdiction over four ships, patrolling overseas in Jinshanzui, engaging in intelligence work. Unexpectedly, his ambitions have not died, and he is willing to be a henchman. When the enemy came, he not only did not report it but also acted as a guide, leading the enemy deep, causing the entire war situation to be affected. Countless lives and properties have been sacrificed. Not only do the people of the various towns in Punan want to eat his flesh, but the country has also suffered a lot. His life as a puppet magistrate will not last long.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Rice and Grains are Arriving in Shanghai; Rice Shops are Registering for Widespread Retail Sales</h3>
<p>The selling price is relatively low, at eight and a half cents per catty. The bean and rice industry plans to go to Nantong to purchase Xian rice.</p>
<p>The Hua Nan Rice Industry Company has decided to purchase Saigon rice and transport it to Shanghai for regulation in order to urgently save the people's food supply. The rice will be distributed to rice shops for retail sales. The Rice Shop Association has specifically designated today to register member rice shops in the French Concession for rice distribution and retail sales at the association's location at No. 52 Mao Yi Li, Mei Bai Ge Road, in order to distribute rice to all members in the same way as the first distribution of rice stored by the Shanghai Municipal Council for retail sales in stores, limited to one yuan per person. However, the price of rice this time is relatively low, with a selling price of eight and a half cents per catty.</p>
<p>In order to supply food to the people, the bean and rice industry in this city has specifically taken active measures to open up sources of supply in accordance with the letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. It is now heard that Ren Chengxing, a member of the industry association, plans to go to Nantong to purchase and transport 1,500 bags of Xian rice and has requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to issue a certificate for inspection and release along the way.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that in order to meet the needs of the market, Hua Nan Rice Industry Company has specifically ordered a large number of foreign rice from Saigon. The first batch of 25,000 bags can be transported to Shanghai by French ships today. In addition, the foreign rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council and others can also be transported in the short term. According to reporters, rice merchants from several counties in the eastern part of Zhejiang Province have telegraphed the local rice industry groups, saying that they will come to Shanghai to respond to the market.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Between Detectives and Thieves at the East Asia Hotel</h3>
<p>The Room Doorway as Battlefield - Travelers Frightened and Fleeing in Panic - Three Thieves Killed, Detective Injured</p>
<p>This morning at dawn, the Public Concession Lao Zha Patrol received a secret report stating that a large gang of bandits was hiding in rooms 207, 208, and 209 of the East Asia Hotel on Nanjing Road, plotting illegal activities. Upon receiving the report, the Patrol immediately dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and foreign detectives, who rushed to the location to conduct a secret arrest at 9:00 AM. Unexpectedly, when the detectives burst into room 207, the bandits had already noticed them and immediately opened fire to resist arrest. The detectives quickly returned fire, and a fierce battle ensued at the doorway of the room. Bullets flew everywhere, alarming many travelers, who fled in panic. Some even ran for their lives in only their undershirts, as if a great disaster had befallen them. After a short exchange of fire, the three leading bandits who resisted arrest were shot down by the detectives. Upon seeing this, the remaining bandits surrendered and were taken into custody. A total of four people were apprehended. Some accomplices had already taken the opportunity to escape. A pistol, three Mauser pistols, and three hand grenades were found in the room. The suspects were taken to the patrol station for detention and interrogation, and the remaining accomplices are being pursued for investigation. It is reported that the three injured bandits have died from their serious wounds. It is also reported that Western Detective Chief Wahl was wounded in both hands by bullets while bravely capturing the thieves, and his condition is quite serious. He has been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Short Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Our publication has been in existence for more than three months. Since our army withdrew from the Nanshi area, it has been quite difficult to collect war news. Our evening edition was originally temporary in nature and focused on war reports. Now that the battle lines have extended to Yangcheng Lake, Jiaxing, and other places, spanning over three hundred *li*, the situation has evolved beyond the localized fighting in Shanghai. However, it is not easy to obtain accurate war news at this time. Therefore, we must temporarily suspend publication. When the situation changes in the future, and we can resume our news-gathering duties, we will meet with our readers again. Looking back on the three months of resistance, the bloody battles fought by our loyal and brave soldiers, and the thorough awakening of national consciousness, are undoubtedly a great page in our nation's history. Although the Shanghai battle has come to an end, our government is moving backward, preparing for a long-term and resolute resistance. The unfolding of the second strategic step will surely have a surprising performance. We will wait and see with our readers.</p>

<h3>Enemy Naval and Air Forces Attack Xiamen Recklessly</h3>
<p>Enemy Warships Fire One Hundred Fifty to Sixty Shells - Enemy Entices Our Fishermen in Kinmen</p>
<p>Xiamen Communication: After the enemy warships captured Kinmen, they withdrew in stages. On the 6th of this month, only nine ships remained. The marine corps stationed in Kinmen also withdrew from one thousand to three hundred men, clearly indicating they had no real strength to invade Xiamen. Our army in Xiamen also has a strong force, and after three months of construction, the fortifications are impregnable unless they have a significant army force. However, at 9:55 AM on the 8th of this month, five enemy ships anchored at Wusha in Kinmen suddenly sailed about 20,000 meters from the He Cuo Ta Pu coast in the Heshan district of northern Xiamen Island and fired shells at He Cuo, Wu Tong, and Ao Tou, which belongs to Tong'an across the sea. By 10:10 AM, about twenty shells had been fired. Except for one shell that hit an old tree in Xiabian Township, the rest landed in the mountains and fields, causing no damage. One shell landed on the road in Ao Tou, only creating a hole. Our land-based garrison did not retaliate. At 1:00 PM on the 9th, an enemy plane scouted the He Yi area and left after twenty minutes. At 5:45 AM at dawn on the 10th, an enemy plane again scouted the southern fortress area and the northern Heshan Wu Tong area of Xiamen, flying back and forth. At 6:25 AM, it flew into the city airspace again and left for Kinmen after fifteen minutes. At 7:00 AM, enemy ships sailed from Kinmen, including two cruisers and one destroyer, heading towards the Xiamen port. They then patrolled the harbor. At 9:10 AM, an enemy plane came from Kinmen to scout the southern suburbs of Xiamen at high altitude. An enemy ship, about 20,000 meters from Xiamen Island on the right side of Da Dan Island, fired shells at our fortress area. The enemy plane circled above the fortress area, indicating targets. From 9:10 AM to 10:10 AM, the enemy ships fired salvos, especially concentrated on the Huli Mountain Fort. In this one hour, more than one hundred shells were fired. After a short break of about twenty minutes, the shelling resumed, but it was slower and intermittent. Our artillery garrisons calmly responded, initially refraining from retaliation due to the distance. After 10:00 AM, the enemy ships moved forward to a range that could be reached, and then we fired back, only eight shells in total, which were very accurate. The sixth shell landed next to a destroyer, causing seawater to rise as high as the smokestack. Knowing they could not invade, the enemy ships retreated completely, and the enemy planes also retreated at the same time. This was at 11:20 AM, lasting two hours and ten minutes. The enemy ships fired one hundred fifty to sixty shells, and the enemy planes also dropped two bombs. Most of the shells landed on the beach or in the mountains, causing no damage to the forts or defenses. The two bombs also landed on the slopes, completely missing the targets. From 6:25 AM to 3:15 PM, air raid sirens sounded five times in the city. Except for one time at 9:10 AM, which lasted for two hours and ten minutes, the rest only lasted for fifteen to thirty-five minutes before the all-clear was given. The citizens had experienced enemy attacks several times and were very experienced. After the sirens, the order was in good shape, traffic was controlled, shelter was provided, and fire and rescue services were carried out in sequence. When the all-clear was given, things returned to normal, shops opened, and residents rarely fled to Gulangyu or the mainland. In summary, the enemy fired one hundred fifty to sixty shells and dropped eight bombs in this attack. Except for Shi Tu Yang Li, Yang Jiu Lai, and Xin Qin at No. 158 Shapowei, who were slightly injured by stone chips flying up from the bombing, there were no losses or injuries. The enemy's expenses were likely more than ten thousand *jin*. At 6:00 AM on the 10th, an enemy plane also flew from Kinmen to Zhangzhou. It circled the city airspace once and then dropped two bombs on the southern suburban airfield. Both landed in open fields, only creating three-foot-wide craters. It left after twenty minutes. It circled Shima Town once and returned to Kinmen. This was before the enemy warships shelled Xiamen.</p>
<p>On the Kinmen side, the puppet organization, the "Kinmen Local Security Maintenance Association," failed to be established because it could not convene a meeting of village chiefs to produce it. Currently, there is only a "Kinmen Local Patrol Team" of a militia nature, with Chen Taiyi as the captain and Zhuang Yunzhi as the deputy captain, and twenty team members. They all wear red armbands with the black characters "Great Japanese Resident Kinmen Island Garrison Police." They also forced twenty fishing boats to form a water patrol team, led by former Chamber of Commerce President Wang Tingzhi, under the command of Enemy Marine Corps Commander Komura Masasuke. This land and water patrol team handles local incidents. Komura also issued a public notice, forcing merchants to reopen their businesses by a deadline, but because county residents had fled and there was no source of goods, very few reopened. Recently, an enemy merchant ship came from Taiwan, fully loaded with enemy goods, using bullying tactics to smuggle and dump them. On the 10th, it transported three thousand bags of rice from Taiwan, forcing the people to buy them all, with the price to be paid within forty days. However, merchants still refused to sell them. For two months, the enemy has blockaded the coast, killing fishermen and burning boats upon encountering them, causing hundreds of thousands of fishermen along the provincial coast to lose their jobs. They are even selling their children and are about to starve to death. Recently, the enemy has changed its strategy, enticing fishermen. Those who hang enemy flags are allowed to fish, trading goods or drugs for rice and grain, and are also responsible for advising us on military and local conditions. Xiamen fishermen have lost their jobs for more than two months, and they are already eating only one bowl of porridge a day, still fearing it will not be enough. After the enemy occupied Kinmen, they also slightly changed their attitude. Those fishermen who risked fishing were not intercepted, only slightly inspected, asked about the conditions of the inner harbor, and told to bring more grain to sell next time, and then released. Therefore, fishermen have spread the word that enemy ships no longer make things difficult for fishing boats, and more and more people have been fishing at sea in recent days. Therefore, the Xiamen fish market has gradually become active. The coastal situation is also gradually becoming similar. Because fishermen are forced by life, although the government has discussed ways to provide relief, limited by the economy, realization is uncertain. If fishermen are spared the ravages of enemy ships, they become traitors to the country. This is truly a major problem.</p>
<h3>Refugee Area Now Sheltering 200,000 Refugees</h3>
<p>Father Jacquinot Negotiates with the Japanese Side to Expand the Area</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the office by the International Relief Committee in the Nanshi refugee area, the situation has been improving day by day. For the convenience of work, the area has been divided into three sections, with five foreign committee members, including Barnet, Andrew, Macnaghten, White, and Byers, assigned to various affairs in each section. Father Jacquinot is in charge of all matters in the area. Currently, the area is sheltering 200,000 refugees, and all the houses will not be enough to allocate. In order to accommodate a large number of refugees, it is planned to expand the refugee area. According to reporters who inquired with the International Relief Committee, Father Jacquinot is working hard to discuss this issue with the Japanese authorities. If there are no obstacles, it may be realized in the short term. As for which area to expand to, it is still being discussed. The continuous rain in recent days will surely concern all sectors of society about the refugees stranded in the Republic Road area of Nanshi. Reporters visited the boundaries this morning to inspect. As a result, the refugees have all returned to the shelters, and there are very few wandering on the streets. These few refugees mostly have family members or relatives in the concession and want to find a convenient way to enter the concession. Those throwing food inside the iron fence have also become rare. However, the refugees wandering on the roads along Avenue Dubail are quite crowded, and their miserable situation is no less than that of the refugees in Nanshi.</p>
<h3>Petty Thieves Arrested in the Refugee Area</h3>
<p>No Fewer Than Seventy or Eighty People</p>
<p>The refugee area organized by the International Relief Committee in the northern half of the Nanshi suburbs of the city was previously maintained by city police officers. After our army was ordered to withdraw from Nanshi, security was unsupported, resulting in petty thieves breaking in and stealing. Although a temporary business association has been established by the stores in the refugee area, it has not yet been fully prepared, and theft is still rampant. Subsequently, the chairman of the committee, Father Jacquinot, requested the French Concession Police Department to dispatch a large number of French, Russian, and Chinese detectives in plain clothes to the area to make arrests. It is reported that no fewer than seventy or eighty people were arrested and have been sent to the French Concession Police Station for punishment.</p>
<h3>Nantong Vegetables Shipped to Shanghai in a Steady Stream</h3>
<p>Vegetable Prices Gradually Decrease</p>
<p>The members of the local produce industry in the city have been purchasing large quantities of vegetables from Nantong. Over the past two days, the Tai Gu Company and the Hua Yi Company ships have carried a large amount of spinach, Chinese cabbage, (Chongming vegetables), chives, and Chinese cabbage. Vegetable prices in the city are gradually decreasing.</p>
<h3>Tigers, Leopards, and Lions Have Been Moved Out of the City Zoo</h3>
<p>It Is Heard That the Zoo Has Been Destroyed by Fire</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Zoo originally planned to house the animals in Zhaofeng Park, which was approved by the Bureau of Social Affairs, but the plan was temporarily suspended due to the changing situation. Now, the zoo (Wenba Road, Nanshi) has been reduced to a war zone. As for the animals in the zoo, except for the tigers, leopards, and lions, which have been transported to a safe area by the zoo director, the rest of the animals are still in the zoo. Feeding them has become difficult. At the same time, it is heard that the zoo has been destroyed by fire.</p>
<h3>The Huangpu River Had a High Tide Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Tide Actually Overflowed onto the Riverbank - There Will Be High Tides Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>The highest tide on the Huangpu River this year occurred at 2:00 PM yesterday. At that time, due to the strong northeast winds, the tide overflowed onto the riverbank from the east of North Suzhou Road, starting from Lao Zha, to the west of the New Garbage Bridge. The section at the intersection of Gansu Road was the deepest, almost knee-deep. Therefore, pedestrians had to wade through the water. The roads that were flooded by the high tide from the sewers include Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Ningbo Road, Jiujiang Road, and Guangxi Road. Low-lying areas were flooded with several inches of water, making it difficult to travel. It is also reported that there will be high tides today and tomorrow.</p>
<h3>October Health Report of the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>㊀ Infectious Diseases: Cholera was still present in October, but the number of patients decreased significantly. Measles gradually spread at the end of the month, and its mortality rate was as high as 50%. Most of the patients were refugees. Diphtheria was also discovered, and the number of patients is increasing. However, this type of seasonal disease occurs every winter and is not surprising. Respiratory diseases are gradually increasing due to the climate.</p>
<p>㊁ Hospitals: ㊀ The Isolation Hospital on Bailinan Road received 47 patients, most of whom suffered from diphtheria, dysentery, and meningitis. Six patients suffered from acute encephalitis and died shortly after admission. The patients in the hospital were temporarily moved to other hospitals from October 30 due to the outbreak of war in western Shanghai. ㊁ The Isolation Hospital on Xinzha Road received a total of 515 patients, of whom 180 suffered from cholera. ㊂ The Isolation Hospital on Beihai Road received a total of 126 cholera patients, 171 dysentery patients, and 141 patients with other diseases. ㊃ The Patrol Hospital received a total of 149 Chinese patients and 17 Indian patients. One Indian was wounded by shrapnel and was cured after surgery.</p>
<p>㊂ Veterinary Section: The work of inspecting and analyzing milk is proceeding as usual, and the results are satisfactory. The section continued to collect milk last month to provide relief to refugees and others, and it has been progressing smoothly. The quantity received is as follows:</p>
<p>Since August 21, foot-and-mouth disease has been discovered in cattle and sheep in the western district. Therefore, the Public Works Department has designated a quarantine zone to prohibit the entry and exit of livestock to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>㊃ Vegetable Markets: Most of the vegetable vendors in the concession are operating as usual in the vegetable markets in the central and western districts. There are vegetable markets on North Fujian Road and Burton Road. Only Japanese merchants are in the Hongkou vegetable market. Uninspected meat is often sold in various vegetable markets. Therefore, residents must pay attention and not buy or eat meat that has not been inspected and stamped by the Public Works Department. Fresh fish is relatively scarce, but fish taken from cold storage is sufficient for the market. Vegetables will be shipped in a steady stream, and flour and grain are sufficient. Bread prices remain the same.</p>
<p>㊄ Health Section: The work of injecting cholera vaccines in various refugee shelters has ended. If no more cholera cases are discovered, it will no longer be continued. The work of vaccinating in various shelters, schools, factories, and other public places is ongoing. A total of 31,159 people were vaccinated during the month. A large number of corpses were discovered in the concession. Pushan Shantang has collected and buried 4,222 bodies. 132 corpses of soldiers and civilians were found in the eastern district and were cremated. The staff who specialize in managing health and medical affairs in various refugee shelters are working tirelessly despite difficulties. Some volunteers are particularly diligent in their duties and have achieved remarkable results, which is deeply appreciated.</p>

<h3>Disguised as an Old Woman</h3>
<p>— Liu Yucai</p>
<p>Our army's resistance in Pudong, preventing the enemy from crossing the shore secretly, has been in our minds. Now that our army has withdrawn with pain, everyone feels depressed, but there is a story of wisdom and courage that is worth reporting to readers.</p>
<p>In the eyes of most people, it is believed that Pudong, our army has a very strong force stationed there, so it has never been broken through by the enemy. In fact, it is not entirely true. The reason why Pudong can hold so firmly without letting the enemy succeed, I know, is entirely the effect of the military and civilians working together in defense. The people who are responsible for the work in Pudong can assist the army in all aspects, and they can be responsible for many difficult things. In this step of the military and civilians uniting to resist the war, Pudong's security has always been protected. The current withdrawal is certainly not a retreat, but a strategic planned retreat;</p>
<p>When our army was firmly defending the Pudong area, one day, I went to Pudong because of work needs. I met a postman on the Lan Ni Ferry Street. He told me a story of wisdom and courage to kill the enemy that he personally witnessed below. The beginning of this story is not strange. It is in the coal pile near the Lan Ni Wharf in Pudong. It is said that one afternoon, an already middle-aged woman, with her hands retracted inside her cloth robe, hunching over listlessly, was wandering around the coal pile along the shore. At that time, it happened that a submarine motorboat sailed to the embankment of the coal pile and stopped. At the same time, dozens of submarine boats of varying sizes followed and docked here. Because the first submarine boat was the first to dock, two or three Japanese soldiers went ashore first. When the Japanese soldiers went ashore, they naturally looked around for a long time before carrying it out. It was only visible that the surroundings were quiet, and everything was silent, with only a middle-aged woman wandering around the coal pile near the coal pile, seeming foolish and dazed. A Japanese soldier went up to talk to the woman, and he said: "Are there any more Chinese troops?" The woman replied: "They have all gone." After only this sentence of questioning and answering, the Japanese soldier waved his right hand, and all the Japanese soldiers on dozens of submarine boats went ashore one after another. At this moment, the woman did not care about the Japanese soldier, nor did she need to stand there anymore. She returned to the fence of the coal yard, which was close at hand, and also made a gesture. She herself aimed the machine gun, and when two-thirds of the Japanese soldiers had landed ashore, she began a dense strafing. The Japanese soldiers who did not know they had been tricked were pitiful, and the entire army was wiped out, and none of them survived. The postman declared to me: It turns out that the woman was a disguised enemy-luring operation by our army; therefore, our army has allowed the Japanese army to secretly cross or forcibly cross ashore many times without a sound, and then annihilate them; in the Yangjing Town area, such a thing has happened more than ten times, and each time it was successful, and no one survived. Therefore, the later enemies never knew how their dead predecessors died, and they continued to sacrifice themselves.</p>
