<h3>羅店我軍勁旅猛烈反攻收復金家宅</h3>
<p>乘勝追逐至南塘口敵氣勢窮蹙　犯蘇村之敵被我擊斃三百餘人　劉行敵我有礮戰在潘涇相持中</p>
<p>本報記者今晨二時由□□前綫陣地歸來晤及某高級長官據談㊀敵連日作戰計劃、仍以突破中路為原則、有時以小部隊騷擾試探我虛實、有時聲東擊西、移轉我目標、其目的乃在窺伺我全綫某一弱點、集中主力進攻、但我全綫步步為營、各點均有密切連絡、敵縱源源增援、決不能得逞、㊁羅店為軍事必爭之地、雙方均出全力相搏、旅進旅退者數次、羅店鎮一片焦土、現我軍分扼羅店南西北三面各重要村落、敵雖據有該鎮及東面交通、但無法衝破我陣地．兩軍隔荻涇河對峙、各村落間竟日夜有血戰、敵砲火集中轟擊、我陣綫兀然不動、㊂沿羅店至劉行間、我警戒綫各點、敵騎不絕進犯、而其主力則集中於實劉公路、庄永安橋猛撲我劉行之正面、由孟灣威脅側面、經此數日之激戰、敵窺劉行計劃、顯交被我紛碑無餘、㊃敵近又廈中大部隊伍於市中心區．似積極窺我江灣陣地、見我有充分準備、始終未敢輕於當試．㊄我自動撤至第一道防錢、純係有計劃之行動、現兵力雄厚工車堅固、足可長期與敵作消耗戰也、</p>
<h3>羅店我軍右翼昨晨收復金家宅</h3>
<p>又乘勝進展二千公尺</p>
<p>羅店東南方面、我軍右翼尤梅宅·蘇陳宅·張家宅·金宅·一綫、連日敵攻擊殊烈、所發枹火、當在數千之歡．金宅附近、尤為敵軍砲火之目標、轟擊最烈、廿一日自晨迄晚、敵軍砲火、毫不間息、我軍防禦下事，竟十九被其破壞、無法再守、傍晚、金宅張家宅我軍、遂略向後移、避免無謂犧牲、堅守至午夜、我軍援軍趕至、遂開始向敵軍猛烈反攻、敵軍大出意外、手足無措相率後潰、我軍斃敵無算、激戰至二十二日晨拂曉、金宅張家宅之陣地、完全恢復、我軍收復金宅陣地後、我軍復於昨晨拂曉、乘敵不備、繼續向前進展、我軍勁旅一隊、越過滬太公路、向盤踞於公路東側金家宅之敵猛擊、殺聲一起勢如潮湧、敵軍倉皇失措、潰不成軍．遂將該利完全收復、我軍復秉勝追擊、進展二千公尺．敵紛紛退據南塘口東蘇塘之綫、收拾殘部．憑防禦工事頑抗、我軍仿繼續挺進、昨日下午、巳在南塘口東蘇塘一帶與敵發生劇烈之戰、至晚．爭鬥更烈、我軍此起彼仆、有進無退、該綫敵軍至今晨巳有不支之勢、</p>
<h3>敵犯蘇村慘敗我殲敵三百餘名</h3>
<p>二中隊以上敵軍在姚宅被我解決　敵中隊長一人小除長數人均擊斃</p>
<p>羅店西北之綫．蘇村楊家村一帶、連日以來、血戰不巳、企圖進犯該區我軍陣地之敵軍、被我軍迎頭痛擊後、前昨兩日、又向我軍攻擊、敵以台北守備隊第一第二兩聯隊、進攻我軍蘇村陣地、僞滿軍張海鵬部、則攻我楊家村陣地、偽軍隊中班長以上悉係日人、敵光以密集枹火、向我陣地、肆行轟擊、竟日不息、乃開始向我陣地進犯、我軍防地、異常牽固、全軍沉著應戰、不為所動．俟其迫近時、一躍而出、向其猛撲、血戰甚烈、我軍奮勇向前猛衝、敵軍不支、紛紛後潰、我軍乘勝追擊、將敵軍驅逐至半公里以外、逃奔至蘇村西北姚宅之敵約計二中隊以上、三百餘人之數、當被我軍趕上句圍加以殲滅、遺屍滿地殘餘部隊、亦有爬至樹上逃去、仍被我軍擊落、檢視敵屍中隊長一名小隊長數名、已悉被我擊斃敵兵一名被我生擒，直至二十二晨拂曉、殘敵方告肅清、截獲戰利品、不計其數、前昨兩日、敵軍步隊、巳不教再行進犯、惟蘇村姚宅一帶敵軍砲火、不絕向我陣地轟擊而已、</p>
<h3>劉行我敵猛烈砲戰</h3>
<p>劉行正面顧家宅之綫、自我軍在孟灣一帶陣地將敵軍擊潰後、已不見敵軍步兵踪跡、三日以來、敵軍大砲、竟日竟夜、向我軍作不停息之轟擊、我軍砲隊、亦予以還擊、我敵兩軍、遂展開極猛烈之砲戰、至晚八時、砲戰稍息、午夜又起、我軍口師陣地、敵企圖進犯、我身奮勇迎戰、敵不得逞、至今晨仍相持於小園宅潘涇之綫、</p>
<p>劉行朝王廟小朱店一綫、我軍正面陣地、敵軍猛烈進犯經我軍沉着應戰、迄未得逞、至昨晨拂曉、敵改以大砲猛轟我亦還擊、一時戰況頗為緊張、但我損傷極微、</p>
<h3>敵犯持志大學未逞</h3>
<p>昨晨有敵海軍陣戰隊約二百人、藉鐵甲車之掩護、自其江灣路底之根據地、經天通庵及廣中路向我持志大學陣地進犯、我軍以機關槍密集掃擊、敵衝鋒多次、均未得逞、相持小時許、始知難而退、</p>
<h3>閘北方面僅小接觸</h3>
<p>閘北江灣之綫、敵盤踞市巾心區、正忙於布置、無大隊之進犯、惟連日仍有前綫小部隊上摟觸、我陣地並無變化每日敵輒以大砲轟擊、以防我軍之反攻、但其射擊目標散漫、我無損失、</p>
<h3>敵機昨飛浦束投彈</h3>
<p>昨日上午、上海天空、尚稱平靜、於下午二時起、敵機三架、又出擾浦東、於浦東會投彈數枚並在滬南作低空偵察、盤旋數匝而去、三時半、又有敵機二架、在浦東投彈數枚、並用機關檢向下掃射、四時左右、始逸去、</p>
<h3>敵第四次四增援四萬人陸續開滬</h3>
<p>昨有四千人並軍馬登陸　全數開到又將開始總攻</p>
<p>敵稱兵滬瀆、經我堅強抵抗、絕少進展、屢次向國內乞援、現第四次增兵約四萬人、巳陸續開來、昨有運輸艦五般、滿儎步騎兵約四千人及軍械等、分泊大阪黃浦匯山及招商局中棧·北棧·等碼頭而大阪·黃浦。兩岸、並運到軍馬甚多、聞敵方俟援軍全數到滬後、又將開始總攻、</p>
<h3>敵對浦東又謀登陸</h3>
<p>中央社云、昨日午刻左右、有執司傳逹之敵小汽艇一艘、忽又駛泊於新關碼顯浦面之美旗艦奧格司脫號、當有敵傳逹兵上艦送出通知一通、旋經記者向關係方面探悉、此項逹之內容、乃為請求該艦各兵士於晚間勿在艦面來往、俾免有何意外事件發生、觀此、可知敵連日來源源增援後、似對我浦東又有積極登陸企圖、無奈我方早有準備、敵如來犯、必予痛擊云、</p>
<p>楊樹捕方面之敵軍砲兵陣地及停泊於浦中之敵艦、昨日數度關砲向我浦東轟擊、我浦東方面之砲兵陣地、亦迭予還擊、隆隆之聲、整日斷織可聞、</p>
<h3>我空軍偵察敵陣地</h3>
<p>我機三架於咋日下午四時三刻、突在楊村浦一帶敵軍陣地上空出現、敵懾於我空襲之威力、故驚惶異常、倉皇以高射砲抵禦、但我機飛行甚高、來叵偵察數匝、卽行離去、並末投彈、</p>
<h3>大批敵機飛往西北</h3>
<p>昨午一時許、敵機四十五架、自楊樹浦底之臨時機場出發、向西北方飛去、去二時二十分、軍事機關接得江陰方面電話報告、有敵機二十餘架經過該處、惟未肆虐、又經向首都詢問、則亦未前往、</p>
<h3>敵軍運到大量械彈</h3>
<p>昨日下午三時左右又有敵運輸艦Burun　Marn及MoterMarn　二艘駛滬、分靠匯山碼頭及招商局北棧、前者卸下敵重枹多尊，後者卸下未裝置之飛機零件及大號炸彈無算、當卽起運各磚頭棧房暫寫儲放、</p>
<h3>浦江敵艦昨廿四艘</h3>
<p>泊浦敵艦、咋日往來突趨繁忙其數量亦漸見增加、察其形勢、似對浦東登陸企圖、有復趨積極模樣、昨日上午七時·七時二十分·七時半·八時二十分·八時半·下午一時中半·三時·四時十分、先後有運輸艦六艘、駛逐艦三艘、砲艦一艘駛進、昨日上午七時半·十一時半·下午三時·三時半·又有砲艦一艘、駛逐艦二艘、運輸艦一艘駛出、綜計昨日浦內停泊敵艦、共為二十四艘、其分泊情形如下、計三菱碼頭一號·十一號·驅逐艦各一艘、招商局中棧運輸艦生田丸一艘、北棧運輸艦甲丸一艘、匯山碼頭運輸艦BurunMar一艘、大阪碼頭Alaska　Maru一艘、黃浦碼頭曉光丸一艘、四十號·三十八號·十五號·八號·七號·三號·一號浮筒駛逐艦各一艘、三十號·二十七號·二十二號·十七號·十三號·九號·浮筒砲艦各一艘、十一號浮筒砲艦兩艘、北京路外淮外檔砲艦一艘、二號浮筒巡洋艦出雲旗艦一艘、以上共計砲艦九艘、驅逐艦九艘、運輪艦五艘、巡洋艦一艘、共計一十四艘、</p>
<h3>西報論調一致痛斥敵機轟平民</h3>
<p>殘酷殺人戰略絕無效果可言　東京大阪將遭同樣悲慘命運　—敵應覺悟報應公律—</p>
<p>字林報</p>
<p>字林報昨載Robert　L　Stewrt投函、論日機轟炸中國無防之城市事、辭旨憤激、大可代表本埠外人之輿情、函日、今何必再費光陰、寫婉轉動人辭藻富麗之文孛、以期激起彼兇徒之理智或道德乎、此輩因陸地屠殺事業迄今未獲較人之成功、乃惱羞成怒、而轟炸無防之城市、其耳中所喜間者、僅落於非戰斗員之炸彈爆炸聲、共腦筋全同於森林中之野獸、任何人費去一晚、以聆日本官立無綫電臺之短渡播音、卽司知今日日本之一切，厥為報告轟炸慘擊之如何得利、而以使人厭聞之議惰鋪張之、惟藉此可引起和平團體之注意，使知今已臻彼等大呼抗議之時矣、彼等若不乘目前之機會、嚴厲反對中國無防城鎮中成千盈萬之非戰鬥員難民醫院職員婦女兒童之慘遭殲害、則在距今不遠、東京大阪及其他人煙稠密諸城市之不幸的公民、亦遭同樣悲慘之命運時、彼等亦當緘其金口也、日本高等指揮今方切其言行表明其所施可怖行動為合法、是不啻邀該敵對之轟炸機隊取相同之合法手段、攻擊日本自己之土地、此轟炸機隊此時無疑帥正在一北方著名口岸作此準備、日本之諸友、對於日本萬千無辜公民不司避免之命運、必將為之驚駭不置、如日本高級指揮永不覺“報應公律”之宜予承認則恐二旦發作、將見其規模之大、雖其最嗜殺之同僚、亦將為之束手無策矣、此種慘酷轟炸中國城村之舉、尚有一點須注意者、厥為所及於中國大軍之影響、是今日若需事物、以堅士氣則欲覔求較此更有實效之方法、殆不可得、惟其偉大效果之寶現、尚需時日也、日軍竭盡能力，展其戰略、希圖攻破華軍之防綫、本不得逞、加以戰費之羅掘、死傷之衆多、其結果恐將使其國內領袖數人為之醒悟、而作亡羊補牢之計、他日下令停止開火”以作和平談判時、華兵飲恨刺骨、其肯服徙其長官之命令乎、而卽此罷休乎、僅日本之樂觀家希望彼等之服從、於是吾人將聞和平團體因坏許退軍安然登其運艦而復囂然出而反對矣、</p>
<p>大美晚報</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、日飛機之轟炸南京廣州也、寶違反吾人所視為文明的一切規則、彼等故意攻擊人煙稠密之居民區城、致令多數無辜平民喪失生命、就日人在上海·南京·廣州·等處之行動觀之、彼等今日應然以摧毀非戰鬥貝之生命與財產為其真正軍事目的、人道二字茲姑舍而不論、然此種殘酷的殺人戰略、不僅無效果可言、且將擭得興其心願相反之結果．中團受此待遇、不得不格外堅忍團結、以予抵抗、蓋以屠杀平民為務之敌人、無论如何、難望其迴心转意也、舍此果有何道乎、</p>

<p>［華盛頓］擄國務部宜稱、美國駐日大使格魯今日已向日本政府第一一次抗議轟炸南京措辭較前更為强硬、且亦較為正式、其中詳細設明美國對於轟炸平民之立場同時中國駐美大使王正廷今日會與國務部次長威爾遜討論“一般局勢、”國務部長赫爾聲稱、此次美國所提出之抗議、表示“誠懇希望”日本以後能“避免”轟炸南京、美國以為此項舉動“違背人道”、且有捐害美國人民之財產、危及美開使館人員與僑民、以至間斷中美兩國政府聯網之可能云、赫氏對於世界各國為轟炸南京一事、擬向日本聯合抗議之說、不願批評、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］美政府對日所提二次抗議內稱、日本飛機轟炸南京之舉、足以危及美國橋民與一般非戰鬥員安全、實非美國政府所能贊同、美國官民係在南京從事正常職務、完全合法、原無予以撤退之理由、美國政府以為大舉轟炸人煙稠密之廣大區域、匪特毫無理由可言、抑亦違反國際公法與人道主義、且以本案而言、日本要求各國官民撒退之期限、殊嫌過於短促、又日本飛機轟炸範圍、旣若是廣大、美國官民與一般非戰鬥員、卽使撒退、亦絕無安全保障可言、”日本政府前會提拱諾言、聲明對於各友邦在華橋民之生命財產、加以尊重、特按之過去事實、凡在飛機轟炸區域內之人民生命財產、極難以有效辦法加以保障、“查南京乃中國政府所在地、美國大使興其他官員係在該處執行職務、任何措置、凡足以使該大使與各該館員非放棄職守、卽須躬冒嚴重危險、以致進退維谷者皆非美國政府所能接受、”日本政府前會聲明、謂該國飛機轟炸目標、係以中國各軍事機關為限、對於普通人民與匪戰鬥員之生命財產、各國使領錧與軍艦之安全、均當加以尊重、“然則以南京全市作為轟炸目標一事、若謂足以代表日本政府之意向所在、殊非美國政府所能置信、今後美國僑民倘因日本在南京方面之軍事行動而受有損害、美國政府自當保留要求賠償之權利、同時仍切望日本當局對於轟炸南京及其近郊一事、設法加以避免云、（中央社二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>敵機向南京廣州大屠殺世界輿論憤怒疾惡</h3>
<p>視為近代史上最兇惡之醜行　倫敦泰晤士報謂適促成我團結</p>
<p>［倫敦］泰晤士報今日評論日本對擊傷許閣森大使事件復文、并涉及中國近事、稱日本之正式復文、較之上次復文已大為滿意、但日外部發言人旣稱不攻擊非戰鬥員及不優犯外人利權、則今日對於南京肆行無人道之轟炸、將作何解、該報稱此種轟炸已引起各國之憤怒與懨惡、而英國輿論對於日本以此種奇怪方法、强迫華人向之“表示誠意”、尤為髮指、一般人以為倘使中國有力能作空襲之報復者、日人必不敢出此、血日人竟如此倣慢狂妄、實令人憎惡、泰晤士報繼請、中國在此不宣之戰爭中國迄今尚無州崩潰之現象、中國之抗戰、恐將逼迫日本軍部再增加戰事預算、而益使中國之民衆團結一致、如中國共産黨之歸順中央、卽足表示日本軍人之政策、在已往三年之中、已成就蘇聯十五年宣傳之功、無促成未能成就之全國統一、泰晤士報未謂、日本之民衆、月前或尚不願總受調停、但在將來、中立國家、其利益受有影響、勢將出而斡旋和平云、（中央社二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英保守黨報紙認政府對於日本擊傷許閣森之復文有卽作為結束之理由、但對於最近日機之轟擊南京廣州、則表示深切之關切、蓋被等認此種攻襲、頗離與日本關心於非戰鬥員之安全及外人權利助產之担保、相符而行、新聞記事報則代表自由党之意見发言日、“此種殘殺行為實為近代史上不皂曰之大人屠戮之最醜惡之榜樣、該報復請閲者試觀半版地位之影片、上有受傷之小孩、臥於一舁床、由童子軍為之包紮、并請讓者致書議員、要求聯合各國、制正此種慘無人道之轟炸、每日民聲報則代表工黨之意見稱日空軍之襲聲南京廣州、為野蠻種類未受文化之行為、倘各文明國家不由國聯之機構而聯合對付、則今日南京之命運、明日將降臨我等各國之首都云、（中央社二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］向來袒日之晨郵報、今日評論日本對於許閣森大使被擊傷案之復文、謂日機大舉轟炸南京、與日本對於非戰鬭員安全之保證、其言行殊不相符、日本對此易於大戰中使之敗北而極難予以征服之國家用兵、竞傾九牛二虎之力、其在英之友人、觀此情形、不得不為惶恐、日本從事此種事業、而其經濟軍事或政治利益、均極無把握、似足消耗其國力、而無底止、恐其結果、獲益者非爲、而為蘇聯、日本今往中國、已對蘇聯暴露其弱點矣云、（中央社二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英國官場方面頃談日本飛機大舉轟炸南京一事、謂此種行為“荒廖絕倫一、許閣森案情跡雖頗重大、但還不如此事之重要、日本飛機轟炸南京結果、已使普通人民死傷多人、英國人士不分派別、聞訊之餘、咸皆為之憤激、官場人士並謂復文中有一段、係謂“日本政府、亟欲在可能範圍內、限制非戰鬥員所感受之危險、茲已再度向中國境內日本軍事當局發出命令、對淤非戰鬥員之安全、務必極端注意”今茲日本乃以飛機大舉轟炸南京、實行上項政策、可謂異矣、至於日本軍事當局未奉命令、而自決定轟炸南京、自亦可能、但東京方面對於此事、並未發生何項反響、則亦事實、英法美三國茲已分別向日本政府提出抗議、然在目前情形之下、恐難牧效、至以英國政府而論、則決不承認日本在中國境內、有向英國當局發給命令、或提出勸告之權、並决心維護英國外交官陸海軍與、僑民之權利、而當賡續進行外交行動、不屈不撓、俾普通人民之安全、獲得尊重、并以種種方法、保護英國僑民云、（中央社二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>告北美人士</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>在太平洋的東西岸。生存着美國和中國。同樣是地大物博的國家。同樣是樂愛和平的民族。許多年來在中美兩個民簇中間。沒有任何的隔閡。有的只是文化上的交流與貿易上的互惠。而在近年來遠東所發生的不斷政治糾紛中。我們見到北美的人士總是採取着特別關切的態度。是的。美國在中國曾經創辦着許多文化機關。曾經建立下許多商業關係。美國又是遠東方面幾個重要國際條約的發起者。所以美國是主張維持中國的門戶開放與貧重遠東的條約神聖的。這些主張。與中國希望維持遠東和平的宗旨。完全相合所以我們常常想着。在我們爲和平而奮鬥的道路上。美国。正像其他许多爱好和平的国家一樣。應當是和我們携手合作的好朋友。</p>
<p>中國這幾年來顯然是陷在和美國完全不同的命運中。我們受着了隣近我們的日本帝國主義的侵略。日本軍閥根據着他們的大陸政策。在一九三一年開始。侵奪了我們東北三省。又吞併熱河。更踏入關內。逐步割取我冀察兩省。我們曾經起來與侵略者搏鬥。但是因為種種的原因。我們的搏鬥始終沒有貫澈初衷。把侵略找們國⼟破壞遠東和平的敵人驅逐出去。不過在我們搏鬥的期間。北美人士所給與我們的同情的聲援。却常常是我們所感激着的。我們想着。有一朝。中國全國人民會集合在一個抗戰的旗子下與侵略者作最後的搏鬥。——那不僅是一個關係中國命運的搏鬥。而也是關係着整個民主和平世界的命運的博鬥。——到那時候。美國對於我們的同情的聲援。一定會有更具體更積極的表現的。</p>
<p>現在我們最後的搏鬥已經開始了。日本帝國主義挑開蘆溝橋衝突。製造上海事件。已經迫使栽們全國上下集合在一個抗戰的旗子下。發動了為民簇自由為世界和平而鬥爭的神聖抗戰。我們確信着最後的勝利。因為不但我們全國的鬥志非常堅決。世界的大部分同情也都在我們方面。英法蘇聯都已明確的表示態度。反對日本的侵略行為。運德意兩國。和日本有着某种協定關係的。都觉得日本在這時候的趁火打刦。來得太殺風景。並没有给與顯明的同意。然而在我們這樣引以自慰的環境中却有一個重大的缺憾。就是一向我們認為最能同情中國的美國。忽然表示了猶豫徬徨的態度。美國的孤立主義者主張從遠東撤退。美國的和平主義團體要實施中立法。白宮當局曾經警告在華美僑。若不撤退。應自負安全之責。後來甚至宣布了禁運軍火到中日兩國的命令。最近。在日木侵略者恫嚇以空軍糜爛我首都的時候。他國的外交人員都毫無畏懼。表示不能遷避。而美國的外交人員却獨為例外。遷登軍艦辦公。這些。猶豫不定的表示。在中国一般人的心理上。已經引起了驚怪以至失望的反應。不但有中国。在全世界許多關心於國際正義和遠東和平的人士。都不禁失聲地問着。美國卽使决心拋去了她在遠東多年經營的商業基礎。難道她將放棄她一向主張的維持和平與尊重條約的政策了嗎。</p>
<p>這種懷疑與失望。在赫爾國務鄉向東京提出了堅決抗議。反對日軍轟炸中國平民城市。毀壞美國在華利益之後。已經减除了許多。然而我們覺得。要把前述的許多行動所造戎的懷疑與失望全部消除。恐怕還需要更積極更具體的表示。而我們相信。以美國所保有的酷愛民主自由的光榮傳統。以美國人士一向為正義而鬥爭的偉大精神。以美國多年對於遠東和平所抱持的積極態度。這樣史進一步的表示。並不是沒有可能的。</p>
<p>不過。我們知道。我們絕不是要以自己的利害。來影響美國的政策。所以美國對於遠東目前的嚴重局勢。應該有何表示。取何步驟。都不是中國所能過問的。但我們在對於美國所懷抱的熱望之中。覺得有幾點意見。應該向北美的人士說明一下。第一。正如我們前面所指出的。我們現在對日本侵略者抗戰。不單是為了我們自己的生存。也是為了遠東以至全世界的和平。第二。我們希望美國不要採取目前這樣猶豫彷徨的政策。是因為這種政策足以妨碍中國的抗戰力量。助長日本的侵略野心。而其結果正是足以增加日本侵略者對於世界和平的威脅。那顯然是和美國人士一向同情中國及愛好和平的初衷相違背的。第三。我們要求美國對於遠東的嚴重局勢有更積極的表示。那並不是要使美國許多和平人士投入遠東流血的漩渦。更不是要把美國牽在國際外交糾紛的沸鍋中。實在說。中國的希望和平。正和其他愛好和平的國家一樣。但在侵略者步步進追的時候。我們是不得不拚着流血。對侵略者作生死關頭的搏鬥了。而我們可以想到。假如目前愛好和平的國家。不以積極的力量。把侵略者撲滅。則她的威脅。終會直接達到每一個愛好和平的國家身上。</p>
<p>上面僅是表示了我們的幾點意見。我們希望北美的賢明人士會加以接受。在最後。我們願借去年美國外交政策協會所出版“太平洋上的衝突”一書中的幾旬話。來作為結東“在將來。太平洋形勢的演變。有幾種可能—或老是日本幾績侵略。不受阻止。或者中國要起來防衛她自己。或者西方的一二強國。不得不起萊阻止日本的前進。或者有一個解决的辦法旣各國以集體的行動阻止戰爭侵略。保橙永久的和平”這是一位美國外交華者的意見我們相信美國人士定會從其中得到個最好的判斷。</p>

<h3>東南醫學院决遷武昌</h3>
<p>臨時仍在滬開課</p>
<p>東南醫學院眞如校舍、白被敵機炸燬後南市滬軍營校舍、亦因戰事關係無法繼續、據該院院長郭琦元談、本院目滬戰發生後即謄出校舍為紅十字會設立傷乓醫院、本院醫生、在四五六二級者、並即出動服役、為傷兵治療、惟敵機蓄意燬壞我文化機關、並逹反國際公法、轟炸傷兵醫院、屢次前往眞如轟炸、將本院房屋</p>

<p>連日敵軍畏我空軍夜襲、於下午七時起、所有浦江敵艦及楊樹浦、虬口區敵軍陣地內、一概不敢燃燈、雖敵軍事最高長官擧行重要會議、亦復如是、因之吾人一至外灘向東遙望、自外白渡橋起、卽成黑黝世界、靜寂無聲、最如鬼魔地獄、而敵軍於是時難在建築防禦工程、或搬運軍需品者、亦僅賴蘇州河以南租界區內之電燈反映火光、摸索而行、厥狀之狼狽與悲慘可憐、實無以復加、</p>
<h3>敵空襲首都在戰略上極不利</h3>
<p>機械上地利上得失判然　我以逸待勞與敵以重創</p>
<p>本報記者、昨日晤及甫自京來滬之中央某要員、叩以連日敵機迭次　京之戰況、當蒙闡述敵我雙方空戰之利害得失甚詳、特錄於次、</p>
<p>溯自滬戰發動迄今、已逾四旬、前方賴我忠勇將士之浴血抗戰、後方賴我政府民衆之一德一心、已使頑敵手足無措、進退失據、速戰速决之旣成幻影乃不得不大逞獸行、竟以空軍威脅我首都、而冀達到我國向其屈膝之夢想、近更變本加厲、蔑視國際公法、乃不惜用恐嚇卑劣手段、竟通知各國駐京使節離開我首都之警告、但各國不獨不為所動、且更分別向日政府提起責難與抗議、足徵公道自在人心、法理並未泯滅耳、至於敵機迭次襲京之結果、其本身物質上之損失、姑置勿論僅就機械上之原理及地利上之優劣、各加以簡單之說明、卽不難明瞭敵我雙方利害與得失、夫敵之空軍根據地、其遠自台北者、姑不必論、卽自滬東陸地起航飛達京市最短時間、亦需一小時左右、但敵機一旦起飛、則機上所有之一切、卽完全陷於極度悲運之中、蓋敵機出發以後、在任務未畢、未獲安然飛歸自己根據地以前、決無中途降落之可能、有之、除非被我擊落以外、其他如因機身感受重創或續航力時間已屈、汽油已罄、致被迫降落時、最低限度、則機上所有航空人員、必立時成爲俘虜、而飛機本身亦必為我戰利品矣、職是之故、敵之空軍人員、一經升空之後、虛荒膽怯之念、卽充滿於心頭、再敵機之襲我首都、其主要目的、係在轟炸、故必以多數之重轟炸機載以極重量之炸彈、而以半數之戰鬥機爲隨護、但轟炸機因本身之載重、活動遂呈異常笨滯、待遠航至目的地之上空、一經我方空軍及防空部隊之迎擊、敵機頓時倉惶失措、立卽失却連絡、其隨護之戰鬥機、固急於將機槍放完、以圖塞責、而轟炸機更迅冀將炸彈擲舉、以求逃命、至於來往中途、隨時隨地更有遭我截擊之虞、尚其餘事、至我方空軍一切則反是、不獨隨時隨地旣可升降自由、更以逸待勞、以實擊虛、且我迎戰者、均係戰鬥機與驅逐機、故輕而且快、活動敏捷、尤無續航力時間上之種顧慮、此乃從機械上及地利上之事實論列、毫無疑問者也、夫敵機一雖一再橫施其暴行、我國沿海及內地重要城市、敵機幾轟炸殆遍、而其所獲之結果、不獨不能使我屈服於萬一、更足增進我全國國民之憤懣、抑且堅强我抗戰到底之决心也、</p>
<h3>津浦綫前方礮戰甚烈</h3>
<p>結果我軍佔優勢　敵機轟炸滄州站</p>
<p>［濟南］今早、前方砲戰甚烈、我佔優勢、敵機四架竄滄州車站東關投七八彈、又五架由滄竄磚河復轉回滄轟炸、敵機三十六架昨轟炸運雲港、企圖掩護登陸被擊退、（二十四日上午十一時急電）</p>
<h3>援引九國公約處理中日爭端</h3>
<p>各簽字國倘有所建議　美政府定當愼重研究</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國務卿赫爾頃發表談話稱、遠東時局自昨日以來、並無何項新發展、關於巴黎非戰公約或華府九國公約能否實施一項問題、目下無可發表云、又國務院某官員宣稱、關於援引九國公約、以處理中日兩國現行爭端一項計劃、政府除在報紙上見有此項消息之外、並未接獲何種情報、此在半官界人士、則謂九國公約非戰公約各簽字國或其他各國倘有所建議、美國政府定當鄭重加以研究、按美國現行外交政策、乃以國務卿赫爾七月十六日所發表之書面談話為基礎、而依照赫爾上月二十三日所發表之聲明、則華府九國公約與巴黎非戰公約所載各項原則、實已列入七月十六日書面談話之中矣、（中央社二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］聞諸負責方面簽定九國約擔保中國主權與土地完整之美國與其他領袖國家、已在過去數日中、交換關於其所採對於中日衝突種種洛動之情報惟目前尚未有任何簽約國、擬正式援用此約之表示、蓋以此舉有許多困難也、其困難之原因為㊀此約並未規定設置實施簽約國會議所决定辦法之機關、㊁召集會議時日本殆必拒絕參加將使情勢益臻糾紛、㊂簽約國所抱意見大相逕庭、欲成立一種特殊行動之協定、殆為不可能、據消息靈通者云、簽約國間先須經過若干初步凖備工作、以期成立團結一致之陣綫、而後始可召集會議、否則倉促開會、未必有良好結果之望也、聞美國當局決計避免趨入外交上窘境如一九三二年國務卿史汀遜所遭遇者、（中央社二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>日使住宅前倫敦市民示威</h3>
<p>［倫敦］今日夜半倫敦男女市民二百人、游行日駐英大使吉坦往宅附近之廣場、事後齊集吉田住宅前高呼“撤去中國境內之日本殺人犯”、“召回你們的轟炸機”、一時形勢緊張、</p>
<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>我有兩事。敬告日本人民。其一。據東京電訊。因對華用兵。對外貿易。大受影響。八月入超四千七百萬元。各路航運損失鉅。國內外商業。均呈停頓狀態。萬一戰事延長勢非第三次增加預算不可而直接受其負担者均為一般不希望戰爭的人民。其二。日本軍閥戰事失利。窮極無聊。專以轟炸我國無辜人民為能事。故某西報謂。現在日飛機慘殺我國無辜民衆。他日亦必有國家。以飛機轟炸東京大阪及其他人煙稠密城市之一日。乃若其時。亦決無人為之哀憐。以上兩端。均日日本人民關於對華用兵已往與未來所遭遇的慘痛。故近日日本名律師域森弘近著“戒軍國主義者”一文。宣傳反戰思想。被警視廳所拘捕。誠然。在此瘋狂軍閥威權控制之下。日本人民。原無置喙之餘地。惟日本人民亦必有“馬極跳墻”之一日。我望日本富於理性之國民。及早覺悟。毋貽援悔。</p>

<h3>地方救護事業之統制與合作</h3>
<p>— 黃貽清</p>
<p>八一　滬戰爆發，余曾隨紅會某救護隊赴某地籌設臨時醫院，商洽之間，知地方人士雖極願與地方官廳合作，但終禾能釋然於官廳之以“統制”方式辦理戰時救護。及事畢返滬，晤某慈善團體領袖，言及某地亦已設立救濟醫院，深以為幸，惟談吐之　，亦死不以官廳統制救護為然。</p>
<p>按“統制”云云，聞係出諸某省民廳訓令，令文何如，金未之見。然推測廳令之所以必予“統訓”，其唯一旨趣，當在杜絕流弊。揆之中央救護事業辦法大綱各省市救護委員會組織辦法，各省市應於省市政府所在地設置救護委員會，由㊀醫藥業團體及醫事教育機關，㊁商會，㊂中國紅十字會，㊃其他與教擭工作有關之團體各團體，機關組織之，當地黨部及政府，衛生主管機關派員指導參加。是擭委會之組織，原應以地方團體為主體，黨政機關不過處參加組織，指導進行之地位；一切救護之實際工作，自應由民衆團體義不客辭，協力設施，推負實際責任，省府轉令縣府組設縣護委會，當亦不能出此范圍。</p>
<p>今全面抗戰，形勢已成，處此危急存亡之秋，苟各地官民之間，稍存客氣，名義上號稱合作，而一究其內容，則地方官廳或不免同執所謂“統制”之事權，空具計劃，傲臨於七，民衆助力，迄難𫊧得。嘏民衆有力團體，亦或不免意存觀望，惟恣官廳之食天之功，以為已力，而絕鮮予以經濟合作，救護機關，興廢生滅，衆聽自然。馴致民衆之於救護工作，空空如也，無緣受制，官廳之於當地救　事業，亦復捕風捉影，無物可制。意念及此，救護前途，甯堪設想！</p>
<p>竊意實事求是，凡接得此項一統制令文之各地官民，第一宜認清百方不予統制，實無以杜絶流弊。第二，宜認清所謂統制，在消極的上項作用外，別無作用：換言之，地方合法團體所親護委會自應主持籌募辦項、辦理救護工作，同時官廳亦自宜從旁予以指導，予以贊助，而絕對不應予以制阻。第三，宜認清此係救亡義舉，殊無事　與名議之可言，既同　關民，即均所應為，須不分人我，更無論官民，不約而同，爭先做去，如是，則庶幾各地辦理救護所需人材，藥物，設備，給養，自可叱咤立辦，源源接濟，而全面抗戰中當地應有之救護工作，容或可以充分施展，經久維持也。</p>
<p>之　人君子，以爲　如。</p>

<h3>Our Elite Troops in Luodian Launch a Fierce Counterattack and Recapture Jinjiazhai</h3>
<p>Pursuing the Victory to Nantangkou, the Enemy's Morale is Exhausted. Over 300 Enemies Attacking Sucun are Killed by Our Forces. Enemy and Our Forces Engage in Artillery Battles in Liuhang, Stalemated in Panjing.</p>
<p>Our newspaper reporter returned from the front lines at 2:00 AM this morning and interviewed a senior officer, who stated: ❶ The enemy's operational plan for the past few days still prioritizes breaking through the central route. They sometimes use small units to harass and probe our defenses, and sometimes employ feints to distract our focus. Their aim is to find a weak point in our entire line and concentrate their main forces to attack. However, our entire line is fortified step by step, and all points are closely connected, so the enemy's continuous reinforcements will not succeed. ❷ Luodian is a strategically vital area, and both sides are fighting with all their might. There have been several advances and retreats. The town of Luodian is a scorched earth. Currently, our forces are stationed in important villages to the south, west, and north of Luodian. Although the enemy occupies the town and the eastern transportation routes, they cannot break through our defenses. The two armies are facing each other across the Di Jing River, and there are bloody battles in the villages day and night. The enemy's artillery is concentrated on bombardment, but our front lines remain unmoved. ❸ Along the line from Luodian to Liuhang, the enemy cavalry constantly invades the guard posts. Their main force is concentrated on the Shi-Liu Highway, launching fierce attacks on the front of our Liuhang from Zhuang Yong'an Bridge, and threatening the flank from Mengwan. After several days of fierce fighting, the enemy's plan to seize Liuhang has been completely thwarted by us. ❹ The enemy has recently transferred a large force to the city center, seemingly to actively reconnoiter our Jiangwan defenses. Seeing that we are fully prepared, they have never dared to attempt a light attack. ❺ Our automatic withdrawal to the first line of defense is a planned action. We now have a strong force and solid fortifications, sufficient to engage in a long-term war of attrition with the enemy.</p>
<h3>Our Army's Right Wing in Luodian Recaptures Jinjiazhai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>And Advances Another 2,000 Meters in Victory</p>
<p>In the southeast of Luodian, the enemy's attacks on the line of Youmeizhai, Suchenzhai, Zhangjiazhai, and Jinzhai have been fierce in recent days, with thousands of shells fired. The vicinity of Jinzhai, in particular, has been the target of the enemy's artillery fire, with the most intense bombardment. From morning to night on the 21st, the enemy's artillery fire did not cease, and our defensive works were severely damaged, rendering it impossible to defend. In the evening, our troops in Jinzhai and Zhangjiazhai retreated slightly to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, holding firm until midnight. Our reinforcements arrived, and a fierce counterattack was launched against the enemy. The enemy was taken by surprise, became confused, and collapsed. Our troops killed countless enemies. By dawn on the 22nd, the positions in Jinzhai and Zhangjiazhai were completely restored. After our army recaptured Jinzhai, they continued to advance yesterday morning, taking the enemy by surprise. A strong unit of our army crossed the Hu-Tai Highway and launched a fierce attack on the enemy entrenched in Jinjiazhai on the east side of the highway. The shouts of killing rose like a tide, and the enemy army panicked and collapsed. The area was completely recovered. Our army then took advantage of the victory to pursue, advancing 2,000 meters. The enemy retreated to the line of Nantangkou and East Sutang, reorganized their remnants, and stubbornly resisted with defensive works. Our army continued to advance, and yesterday afternoon, fierce battles occurred with the enemy in the area of Nantangkou and East Sutang. By evening, the fighting was even more intense. Our army rose one after another, advancing without retreating. By this morning, the enemy on this line was showing signs of collapse.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Disastrous Attack on Sucun: We Annihilate Over 300 Enemies</h3>
<p>More than Two Companies of the Enemy are Eliminated in Yaozhai, and One Enemy Company Commander and Several Platoon Leaders are Killed</p>
<p>On the northwest front of Luodian, in the Sucun and Yangjiacun area, bloody battles have been ongoing for days. The enemy army, attempting to attack our army's positions in this area, was met with a head-on blow. Yesterday and the day before, they attacked our army again. The enemy used the First and Second Regiments of the Taipei Garrison to attack our army's Sucun position, while Zhang Haipeng's puppet Manchukuo forces attacked our Yangjiacun position. All platoon leaders and above in the puppet army were Japanese. The enemy used dense artillery fire to bombard our positions relentlessly, and then began to attack our positions. Our defenses were exceptionally strong, and the entire army calmly resisted, remaining unmoved. When the enemy approached, they leaped out and launched a fierce attack. The fighting was extremely fierce. Our army bravely charged forward, and the enemy could not withstand it and collapsed. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, driving the enemy more than half a kilometer away. About two companies, more than 300 men, of the enemy who fled to Yaozhai, northwest of Sucun, were caught up and annihilated by our army. The corpses were scattered all over the ground. Some of the remaining troops even climbed up trees to escape, but were shot down by our army. Upon inspection of the enemy corpses, one company commander and several platoon leaders had been killed. One enemy soldier was captured alive. By dawn on the 22nd, the remaining enemy forces had been cleared. Countless spoils of war were seized. Yesterday and the day before, the enemy infantry did not dare to attack again. However, the enemy artillery fire in the Sucun and Yaozhai area continued to bombard our positions.</p>
<h3>Intense Artillery Battle in Liuhang</h3>
<p>On the line of Gujiazhai on the front of Liuhang, after our army defeated the enemy in the Mengwan area, no enemy infantry have been seen. For three days, the enemy's artillery has been bombarding our army non-stop, day and night. Our artillery also retaliated, and the enemy and our forces engaged in an extremely intense artillery battle. The artillery fire subsided slightly at 8:00 PM, but resumed at midnight. The enemy attempted to attack our company position, but our troops bravely resisted and the enemy failed. They are still stalemated on the line of Xiaoyuanzhai and Panjing this morning.</p>
<p>On the line of Chaowangmiao and Xiaozhudian in Liuhang, the enemy army launched a fierce attack on our army's front positions. Our army calmly resisted and the enemy did not succeed. By dawn yesterday, the enemy switched to bombarding with artillery and we also retaliated. The situation was quite tense for a while, but our damage was minimal.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Attack on Chi-Che University Fails</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, about 200 members of the enemy naval landing force, under the cover of armored vehicles, advanced from their base at the end of Jiangwan Road, through Tiantong'an and Guangzhong Road, towards our Chi-Che University position. Our army used machine guns for intensive sweeping fire. The enemy charged many times, but all failed. After an hour of stalemate, they realized the difficulty and retreated.</p>
<h3>Only Minor Contact in Zhabei</h3>
<p>On the Zhabei-Jiangwan line, the enemy is entrenched in the city center and is busy deploying, without large-scale attacks. However, there is still minor contact with small units on the front lines every day. There have been no changes to our positions. The enemy bombards with artillery every day to prevent our army from counterattacking, but their firing targets are scattered and we have suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Pudong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Shanghai sky was relatively calm. Starting at 2:00 PM, three enemy planes harassed Pudong again, dropping several bombs on Pudong and conducting low-altitude reconnaissance over southern Shanghai, circling several times before leaving. At 3:30 PM, two more enemy planes dropped several bombs in Pudong and used machine guns to strafe downwards. They left around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Fourth Round of Reinforcements: 40,000 Troops Continuously Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>4,000 Men and Military Horses Landed Yesterday, All Headed Out, Another General Offensive to Begin</p>
<p>The enemy's invasion of Shanghai has made little progress despite their claims, and they have repeatedly requested reinforcements from their home country. Now, a fourth round of reinforcements, about 40,000 men, has been arriving continuously. Yesterday, five transport ships carrying about 4,000 infantry and cavalry troops and military equipment docked at the Osaka, Huangpu, Huishan, and China Merchants Bureau wharves. A large number of military horses were also transported to the Osaka and Huangpu banks. It is rumored that the enemy plans to launch another general offensive after all the reinforcements arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Enemy Plans Another Landing in Pudong</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Yesterday around noon, a small enemy motorboat with a flag of truce suddenly docked at the US flagship USS Augusta, anchored off the New Customs Wharf. An enemy messenger boarded the ship and delivered a notice. Upon inquiry from relevant parties, reporters learned that the contents of the notice requested that soldiers on the ship not move about on the deck at night to avoid any unexpected events. From this, it can be seen that after the enemy's continuous reinforcements in recent days, they seem to have an active plan to land in Pudong. However, our side is well prepared, and if the enemy attacks, they will be dealt a heavy blow.</p>
<p>The enemy artillery positions on the Yangshupu side and the enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River bombarded our Pudong several times yesterday. Our artillery positions in Pudong also retaliated repeatedly. The booming sound could be heard all day long.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Reconnoiters Enemy Positions</h3>
<p>Three of our planes suddenly appeared over the enemy's positions in the Yangcunpu area at 4:45 PM yesterday. The enemy, frightened by the power of our air raid, panicked and desperately defended with anti-aircraft guns, but our planes flew very high, made several reconnaissance passes, and then left without dropping bombs.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Enemy Planes Fly to the Northwest</h3>
<p>Around 1:00 PM yesterday, 45 enemy planes took off from the temporary airport at the bottom of Yangshupu and flew to the northwest. At 2:20 PM, military agencies received a telephone report from Jiangyin that more than 20 enemy planes had passed through the area, but did not cause any destruction. After inquiring with the capital, it was also found that they did not go there.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Transport Large Quantities of Equipment and Ammunition</h3>
<p>Around 3:00 PM yesterday, two more enemy transport ships, the Burun Marn and Moter Marn, sailed to Shanghai, docking separately at the Huishan Wharf and the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf. The former unloaded many heavy enemy guns, while the latter unloaded unassembled aircraft parts and countless large bombs. They were immediately transported to various brick warehouses for temporary storage.</p>
<h3>24 Enemy Warships in the Huangpu River Yesterday</h3>
<p>The enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River were suddenly very busy yesterday, and their numbers were gradually increasing. Observing the situation, it seemed that their plans to land in Pudong were becoming more active again. At 7:00 AM, 7:20 AM, 7:30 AM, 8:20 AM, 8:30 AM, 1:30 PM, 3:00 PM, and 4:10 PM yesterday, six transport ships, three destroyers, and one gunboat sailed in. At 7:30 AM, 11:30 AM, 3:00 PM, and 3:30 PM yesterday, one gunboat, two destroyers, and one transport ship sailed out. In total, there were 24 enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River yesterday. Their deployment situation is as follows: Mitsubishi Wharf Nos. 1 and 11 each have one destroyer; China Merchants Bureau Middle Wharf has one transport ship, the Ikuta Maru; North Wharf has one transport ship, the Ko Maru; Huishan Wharf has one transport ship, the Burun Maru; Osaka Wharf has one transport ship, the Alaska Maru; Huangpu Wharf has one transport ship, the Akatsuki Maru; Floating docks Nos. 40, 38, 15, 8, 7, 3, and 1 each have one destroyer; Floating docks Nos. 30, 27, 22, 17, 13, and 9 each have one gunboat; Floating dock No. 11 has two gunboats; the Wai Tan outside Beijing Road has one gunboat; Floating dock No. 2 has one cruiser, the Izumo flagship. The above totals nine gunboats, nine destroyers, five transport ships, and one cruiser, for a total of twenty-four ships.</p>
<h3>Western Newspapers Unanimously Condemn Enemy Planes Bombing Civilians</h3>
<p>A Cruel Strategy of Killing is Ineffective, Tokyo and Osaka Will Suffer the Same Tragic Fate - The Enemy Should Understand the Law of Retribution -</p>
<p>North China Daily News</p>
<p>The North China Daily News yesterday published a letter from Robert L. Stewrt, discussing the Japanese planes bombing undefended cities in China. The wording was angry and could represent the public opinion of foreigners in this port. The letter said, "Why waste time writing gentle, moving, and eloquent articles to arouse the reason or morality of these thugs? These people, angry that their land slaughter business has not achieved greater success, are bombing undefended cities, and the only sound they like to hear is the explosion of bombs falling on non-combatants. Their brains are the same as wild beasts in the forest. Anyone who spends an evening listening to the shortwave broadcasts of the official Japanese radio station will know that everything in Japan today is reporting on how profitable the bombing attacks are, and using disgusting idleness to exaggerate. Only in this way can we attract the attention of peace groups and make them aware that the time has come for them to loudly protest. If they do not take the opportunity now to strongly oppose the massacre of thousands of non-combatant refugees, hospital staff, women, and children in undefended Chinese towns, then when the unfortunate citizens of Tokyo, Osaka, and other densely populated cities suffer the same tragic fate in the near future, they should also shut their mouths. Japanese high command is now openly stating that its terrible actions are legal, which is tantamount to inviting enemy bomber squadrons to take the same legal means to attack Japanese soil. These bomber squadrons are now undoubtedly preparing to do so in a famous northern port. Japan's friends will be shocked by the unavoidable fate of Japan's innocent citizens. If the Japanese high command never realizes that the 'law of retribution' should be recognized, then I fear that once it breaks out, its scale will be so large that even its most murderous colleagues will be helpless. One more point to note about this cruel bombing of Chinese cities and villages is its impact on the Chinese army. If there is anything needed today to strengthen morale, it is difficult to find a more effective method than this. However, the realization of its great effect will take time. The Japanese army is doing its best to develop its strategy, hoping to break through the Chinese army's defense line, but it has not succeeded. In addition, the cost of the war is enormous and the number of casualties is high. As a result, I am afraid that several leaders in the country will wake up and make amends after losing the sheep. When they order a ceasefire in the future" to negotiate peace, will the Chinese soldiers, with their bitter hatred, be willing to obey their superiors' orders? And will it just end there? Only Japanese optimists hope for their obedience. Then we will hear peace groups loudly protesting again because the defeated troops are safely boarding their transport ships."</p>
<p>Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury stated that the bombing of Nanjing and Guangzhou by Japanese planes violates all the rules that we regard as civilized. They deliberately attacked densely populated residential areas, resulting in the loss of life of many innocent civilians. Judging from the actions of the Japanese in Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and other places, they should now regard the destruction of the lives and property of non-combatants as their real military objective. Let us put aside the word humanity for now, but this cruel strategy of killing is not only ineffective, but will also achieve results contrary to its wishes. China must become more resilient and united to resist this treatment, because it is difficult to expect an enemy who specializes in killing civilians to change their mind. What other way is there?</p>
<h3>A Certain General's Heroic Spirit Remains, Discussing the Entire Front Line of Battle</h3>
<p>"I am not afraid of him, he must be afraid of me. Since he is afraid of me, he will eventually fail."</p>
<p>Our newspaper reporter, led by Secretary-General □□□ and Staff Officer □□□ of a certain unit, drove to a certain place on the front line last night to visit a general. Recalling that two years ago, the reporter had interviewed him and talked about the Sino-Japanese issue, he had made the heroic statement that "If the rooster does not crow, it is okay, but if it crows, it will startle the world. If China does not resist Japan, it is okay, but if it resists, it will definitely win." Now, the all-out war of resistance has been launched for two months, and the general has been leading his elite troops to participate in the battles on a certain line of Songhu for exactly one week. Although he has repeatedly made great contributions, there have also been heroic sacrifices. According to the general, the enemy has repeatedly claimed that they will be able to attack our Nanxiang line before the September 18th anniversary, but since the 12th, the battles on the entire front line have been very fierce in general. From the 12th to the 17th, the enemy concentrated its artillery fire and adopted a cone-shaped advance method, fiercely attacking Luodian. Our army calmly resisted, fought bloody battles against the enemy, and the enemy finally failed and left, but they were not dead set on their ambition. In the past two days, they have launched fierce attacks on our Luodian positions again. Today (i.e., yesterday) at about 5:00 PM, five enemy tanks came to our position. Later, because our defenders fired densely and cut off the enemy's infantry follow-up, the tanks lost contact and fled in a wounded and panic-stricken manner. At the same time, the enemy forces in Yanghang also adopted a two-pronged approach, attacking our Liuhang line in different directions. The enemy is good at daytime battles, while we are good at night battles and close-quarters combat. The morale is unprecedentedly high, so the fierce battle has lasted for more than 40 days, and the enemy has still not occupied a better strategic location. The enemy has paid a heavy price for the battle of Shanghai, but has not gained any corresponding harvest. It is reported that the enemy will combine the Imperial Guards Division and the First Division to form another mechanized unit to reinforce Shanghai. However, the victory or defeat of a war depends entirely on morale. I am not afraid of him, he must be afraid of me. Not being afraid of him will lead to victory, and being afraid of me will eventually lead to failure. This is an immutable principle. According to this principle, what is the benefit of the enemy's reinforcements, even if they come from the whole country? Moreover, the battle of Shanghai has a great impact on international attention. Our entire country has long made the determination to defend it. The war of attrition and protracted war of the past month has achieved significant results, and we will continue to work hard, use the solid fortifications of the deep courtyard, step by step, and fight to the end in order to win the final victory. The general was energetic, with a cheerful personality, and fond of writing poetry. Before parting, he presented a poem to this newspaper on the theme of "Mid-Autumn Festival on the Battlefield," and his loyalty and love for the country were evident in his words. The reporter learned on the way home that at about 5:00 PM last night, enemy planes circled in the sky, indicating targets for the enemy ships to fire more than a dozen shells. The first classroom, the New Life Movement room, and the sixth classroom, as well as the fourth classroom and the reading room, were all hit by shells, destroying many places. The school is the only highest institution of Chinese studies in Shanghai, and the construction cost was 200,000 yuan, which was the result of ten years of hard work by President Chou Xishen and Secretary Cong Yuzhou. The enemy deliberately destroyed our cultural undertakings, using all possible means. Their methods are truly brutal and base, and they are enemies of the world.</p>

The enemy planes targeted the city center and various military and government organs for bombing, but were thwarted by our planes and anti-aircraft guns. Two bombs landed on the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, damaging only a small corner. Enemy planes circled over the Zengbu Water Plant and the Fengning Road Telephone Bureau, but were unable to fly low enough to drop bombs due to the dense anti-aircraft fire. The enemy released flares to search for targets, and some traitors set off signal rockets. More than a dozen people were captured at the Five Eyes Bridge. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway midnight train was suspended on the 23rd, and women and children left the province to return to their hometowns. Three enemy warships shelled Haikou on the 21st. Our Xiuying Fort retaliated, and after 20 minutes of battle, the enemy retreated without any losses to us. News via special dispatch on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Wuxi] At 2:30 PM on the 23rd, 59 enemy planes attacked Jiangyin, dropping dozens of bombs. The Yiliyong Yarn Factory's ginning workshop outside the North Gate was damaged. Incendiary bombs were dropped on the Qia Ji Rice Mill, causing a fire that destroyed it. Three bombs were dropped near Pushan, with many others falling into the Yangtze River.

The Yiliyong Yarn Factory's cotton ginning workshop and the Qia Ji Rice Mill's oil press workshop were destroyed. We retaliated with artillery fire, and when our planes came to pursue them, they fled, damaging one enemy plane. Our casualties were minor. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Jinan] At 11:15 AM today, ten enemy planes flew from Shijiusuo to Yanzhou Station and dropped more than 20 bombs, only destroying a few houses. Several bombs were dropped inside the camp wall but did not detonate. Half an hour later, they flew back to Shijiusuo. At noon, one enemy plane flew over Jinan, conducted reconnaissance for a week, and then returned north. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Three enemy escort ships and five submarines are anchored off Chiwan, posing a potential landing threat. We are on high alert. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Huaiyin] When enemy planes attacked Huaiyin on the morning of the 22nd, the Air Defense Command captured four traitors at the airport. They have confessed to having more than 20 accomplices, who were used by the enemy to infiltrate and spy on Huaiyin. The authorities are currently searching for them. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] The Japanese air force, not giving the people of Guangzhou any time to catch their breath, attacked again twice this morning. The first attack was at 4 AM, when a single Japanese plane dropped five bombs. As it came and went, it passed over Shamian, flying extremely low, especially when crossing the British bridge. The twelfth attack was at 8:30 AM, when several bombs fell within the city, likely causing significant loss of life. This attack involved ten heavy bombers and several smaller fighter planes, which was more chilling than anything seen before. There was extreme tension in all directions in the air. The aerial combat and anti-aircraft fire were a magnificent sight in the blue sky. Furthermore, the attacking planes operated in squadrons of three, roughly targeting the airport and government offices. A Reuters reporter personally inspected the bombed areas today. In the Dongshan slum outside Shandong, an entire street of poor people's houses was shattered, with not a single building intact. Several corpses, not yet removed, were piled on the ground like dead flies on flypaper. The limbs and remains were unrecognizable, and women wailed as they sifted through the corpses to find their relatives. Some bereaved people wandered the streets, seemingly mentally deranged. Outside observers are largely baffled by the Japanese targets, as government office buildings and military areas were unharmed, while the bombs mostly fell on poor residential areas. Foreigners observing from outside Shamian were speechless at the horrific, non-combatant massacre. On the way, I encountered a man holding a reed mat containing unrecognizable remains. He told the reporter, "This is my wife." Everywhere the reporter went, the sound of crying shook the wilderness, and the sight of children, dazed and frantic, running and crying out for their parents was especially heartbreaking. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Issues Statement After Communist Manifesto is Published</h3>
<p>Government Will Openly Accept Any Faction Willing to Sincerely Save the Country and Work Together</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued the following statement in response to the Chinese Communist Party's declaration to jointly face the national crisis: "The purpose of the National Revolution is to seek China's freedom and equality. Dr. Sun Yat-sen explained that the Three Principles of the People are the principles of national salvation, hoping that all the people of the country will unite to fight to save the nation from danger. Unfortunately, for the past ten years, the general public has not sincerely and consistently believed in the Three Principles of the People, nor have they deeply recognized the national crisis, which has caused many obstacles in the process of revolutionary nation-building. The national strength has been consumed as a result, and the people have suffered sacrifices, leading to the deepening of foreign aggression and the increasing danger to the country. In recent years, the central government has called for unity in good faith to jointly face the national crisis every day, and those who once doubted the Three Principles of the People have also prioritized national interests, abandoned their differences, and converged on a common goal. It is evident that the people of the country today deeply feel the meaning of 'survive together, perish together' and recognize that the interests of the entire nation ultimately transcend the interests of all individuals and groups. The declaration issued by the Chinese Communist Party this time is an example of national consciousness prevailing over everything else. The points mentioned in the declaration, such as abandoning the policy of violent rebellion and the Red Movement, and abolishing the Soviet areas and the Red Army, are all necessary conditions for concentrating strength to save the country and resist foreign aggression, and they all align with the sincere words and resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of our party. Their claim that they are willing to strive to realize the Three Principles of the People further proves that there can only be one direction of effort for China today. I believe that what we are fighting for in the revolution is not personal emotions and prejudices, but the implementation of the Three Principles of the People. In this time of life-and-death crisis, we should not dwell on the past, but should thoroughly reform and unite the people of the country to jointly protect the life and survival of the nation. Today, anyone who is a Chinese national, but can believe in the Three Principles of the People and strive to save the country, the government should not ask about their past and should give them the opportunity to serve the country. For any faction in the country, as long as they sincerely save the country and are willing to fight together under the banner of the National Revolution against foreign aggression, the government will openly accept them and concentrate them under the leadership of our party to work together. Since the Chinese Communists have abandoned their prejudices and recognized the importance of national independence and national interests, we only hope that they will be sincere and consistent, and implement the points mentioned in their declaration. We also hope that under the unified command of resisting foreign aggression and saving the country, everyone will contribute their abilities to the country and fight together with the people of the whole country to complete the mission of the National Revolution. In summary, the principle of China's nation-building is the Three Principles of the People created by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, which is unshakeable and immutable. The Chinese nation has now awakened and is absolutely united, and it must adhere to the impartial national policy, concentrate the strength of the entire nation, defend itself, help itself, resist violent enemies, and save the country from danger. China is not only fighting to protect the survival of the nation and the country, but also to maintain world peace and international credibility. The enlightened people of the world will surely deeply understand this." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>All Five Pawnshops in Nanjing Close Down</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The five pawnshops in Nanjing, Gongji, Xiej, Youji, Tongji, and Yuanji, suddenly closed down on the 23rd and posted a notice at the entrance of each shop, stating that it was to avoid danger due to the current situation. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce believe that pawnshops are important shops for regulating the economy of the poor. Now that they have closed down, it is bound to affect the livelihood of the poor. They sent staff members on the 23rd to investigate and persuade them to resume business and will formulate measures for pawnshops during extraordinary times. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Greek Merchants in Yunnan Donate to Help Us Resist the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Kunming] The barbarity of the brutal Japanese has aroused anger both at home and abroad. Mr. Kolousis, a Greek merchant in Yunnan, admires our country's heroic sacrifice in resisting the enemy. He generously donated 200 yuan to the Anti-Enemy Association to be remitted to the front lines as a token of appreciation. He will continue to donate this amount every month. Li Hexuan, an old man of sixty, believes that he is old and sick and unable to contribute to the battlefield, but he feels it is his duty to alleviate the national crisis by destroying his home. He donated 5,000 Yunnan yuan, which he had accumulated over the years, to support the war of resistance. He said that if the war continues to drag on, he is willing to auction off his estate and donate the proceeds to help resist the enemy. In addition, all the staff members of the Provincial Party Affairs Committee have subscribed to more than 14,000 Yunnan yuan in national salvation bonds.

<h3>Refugees in the Capital Tragically Killed by Enemy Bombing</h3>
<p>Other Deaths and Injuries Still Being Counted</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Last night, Japanese planes wanted to come but did not, so we had a very quiet night. It is now raining heavily, and visibility is poor, so the capital is unlikely to be bombed again for the time being. The general opinion is that Japan intends to break the determination of the Chinese army to resist and will come to Nanjing to bomb again. The number of deaths and injuries from yesterday's bombing has not yet been estimated, as the dead and injured were moved away as the bombing continued. However, more than a hundred refugees in the Xiaguan reception center were caught unawares and tragically killed. The number of deaths and injuries in other places is not high. The Central Party Headquarters was hit by as many as five bombs, but only one person was killed and four were injured, so the total number of deaths and injuries is unlikely to exceed 200. As for the loss of foreign property, only the pontoon bridge of the British International Export Company was sunk. The Chinese side claims that only one Chinese plane was damaged and two pilots were injured. However, a total of four enemy planes were shot down, three of which have been found. Today, Chinese newspapers quoted a statement from Mr. Fardon, the manager of the British Asiatic Petroleum Company, stating that the company will stay in Nanjing. In addition, foreign reporters and photographers have gathered in Nanjing. Many of those from Shanghai left last night by car and arrived safely in the capital this morning. Photographers who were planning to go to the Shanghai front lines to film the war have now changed their plans and returned to Nanjing to film the situation in Nanjing after the bombing.

<p>[Nanjing] At 1:10 PM on the 22nd, 21 enemy planes came to Nanjing for an air raid. When they flew to Xiaguan, they immediately attacked the area around Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., which seemed to be their intended bombing target. At that time, a bomb was dropped on the company's lighter, which was destroyed. A watchman on the boat was injured in the bombing, and a coolie next to the boat was killed. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the enemy planes flew to the front of the company's gate and dropped bombs frequently, injuring a gate guard and destroying the gate wall. Two nearby residents were also injured. The bombed lighter has now sunk, with only a small part remaining on the surface of the water, but the bombing marks are clearly visible. It is reported that the company's manager, a Briton, was elsewhere at the time. After receiving the report of the bombing, he immediately asked the British government to negotiate with Japan.

<p>[Jinan] From the morning of the 21st to the morning of the 22nd, the enemy on the Tianjin-Pukou line launched a general offensive on our left flank at Xiahuayuan and our right flank at Maluopo with the cooperation of infantry, artillery, planes, armored trains, and armored vehicles, but were repelled.

<p>[Jinan] Our left-wing troops on the Tianjin-Pukou line attacked the enemy at Gao Guantun on the night of the 21st. There is now accumulated water between the two armies' positions, rendering the enemy's armored vehicles ineffective. They are relying solely on artillery fire for support, and their infantry is afraid to advance. Our troops are advancing desperately through the artillery fire, so progress is very rapid. We have approached the enemy's positions, about two li away. By 9:00 AM on the morning of the 22nd, the artillery fire gradually subsided. (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] A telegram from the front lines from Yan Xishan states that a unit of our fresh troops launched an attack from the Lingqiu area the day before yesterday, killing many enemy soldiers. The vanguard troops have reached the area around Hehua Linyuan County. The enemy's rear route in Lingqiu has been cut off, and they appear to be retreating along the Hengshan Mountains to Wei County. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to reports received here, the Japanese army's battles south of Beijing and Tianjin have apparently failed to achieve the expected progress. It is reported that the Japanese army is now concentrating its forces to attack Baoding on the Beijing-Hankou Railway and Cangzhou on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, but the Chinese army's positions are extremely solid, and the Japanese army is feeling quite frustrated.

<h3>Enemy Warships Shell Lianyungang</h3>
<p>Retreated After Being Retaliated Against by Us; Enemy Planes Dropping Bombs Were Also Driven Away</p>
<p>[Huaiyin] At 2:00 PM on the 22nd, an enemy warship sailed outside the port of Lianyungang and shelled the wharf area with heavy artillery fire, firing more than ten rounds. It fled after being retaliated against by us. Then, nine enemy planes flew from the north of Donglian Island and dropped more than ten bombs on the Longhai Railway Station building and warehouses. The buildings were destroyed. Our troops opened fire with anti-aircraft guns, and one enemy plane was injured and fled.

<p>[Xuzhou] According to a telegram from Lianyungang on the morning of the 21st, several enemy warships have now concentrated outside the port. On the evening of the 20th, they fired on the shore and dispatched marines in dozens of small boats, attempting to land on the Lianyungang wharf under the cover of artillery fire. They were fiercely strafed by our defending troops with machine guns, and we retaliated against the enemy warships with heavy artillery fire. The sound of gunfire shook the mountains, and flames soared into the sky. The enemy troops were unable to land and fled in panic. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>US Lodges Another Strong Protest Against Japanese Plane Bombing of Nanjing</h3>
<p>Hoping to Avoid Inhumane Acts; Japanese Government Has Submitted a Reply; Germany Also Protests to Japan</p>
<p>[Washington] The State Department announced that the US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, today lodged his second protest with the Japanese government regarding the bombing of Nanjing, using stronger and more formal language than before. It detailed the US's position on the bombing of civilians and that the Chinese Ambassador to the US, Wang Zhengting, met with Under Secretary of State, Wilson, today to discuss "the general situation." Secretary of State Hull stated that the US's protest expressed "sincere hope" that Japan would "avoid" bombing Nanjing in the future. The US believes that this move "violates humanity" and damages the property of American citizens, endangers American embassy staff and overseas Chinese, and may interrupt communication between the governments of China and the United States. Hull declined to comment on the suggestion that countries around the world jointly protest the bombing of Nanjing to Japan. (National telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] The second protest lodged by the US government with Japan stated that the Japanese aircraft's bombing of Nanjing endangered the safety of American overseas Chinese and non-combatants, which the US government could not condone. American officials and civilians are engaged in normal duties in Nanjing, which is completely legal, and there is no reason to evacuate them. The US government believes that the large-scale bombing of densely populated areas is not only unjustified, but also violates international law and humanitarianism. In this case, the deadline set by Japan for officials and civilians of various countries to evacuate is too short. Furthermore, given the vast scope of the Japanese aircraft's bombing, there is no guarantee of safety for American officials and civilians, even if they evacuate. The Japanese government had previously made a commitment to respect the lives and property of overseas Chinese from friendly countries in China. However, based on past facts, it is extremely difficult to effectively protect the lives and property of people in bombed areas. "Nanjing is the seat of the Chinese government, and the US Ambassador and other officials are performing their duties there. Any measure that forces the Ambassador and his staff to either abandon their duties or face serious danger, resulting in a difficult situation, is unacceptable to the US government." The Japanese government had previously stated that the target of its aircraft's bombing was limited to Chinese military installations, and that the safety of the lives and property of ordinary people and non-combatants, as well as the safety of foreign consulates and warships, would be respected. "However, if bombing the entire city of Nanjing as a target is considered representative of the Japanese government's intentions, the US government cannot believe it. If American overseas Chinese suffer damage as a result of Japan's military actions in Nanjing in the future, the US government reserves the right to demand compensation, and at the same time sincerely hopes that the Japanese authorities will find a way to avoid bombing Nanjing and its suburbs." (Havasi dispatch from Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently stated that regarding Japan's decision to launch a large-scale bombing of Nanjing, in addition to making oral representations to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, also sent a written note to the Japanese government at 8:30 PM today. President Roosevelt is currently touring the western states and is scheduled to return to Washington in two weeks. However, the situation in the Far East will continue to be reported to the President at any time. (Havasi dispatch from Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull said when announcing the second protest that he had received a Japanese reply, but declined to disclose its contents. Hull said that he had just received an official report from Nanjing that when Japanese aircraft bombed Nanjing that day, a bomb fell inside the embassy, but there were no casualties or property damage on the American side. In addition, no one has yet consulted with him about the UK and the US jointly recalling their ambassadors to Japan. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Japanese Embassy in the US told the Associated Press today that Japan notified the US that the Japanese Air Force had no intention of bombing civilian areas of Nanjing or damaging foreign property, and that its target was only military locations, which could shorten the war. Japan has always been responsible for the lives and property of foreigners. (National telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] German Ambassador to Japan, Herbert, submitted a note to the Japanese Foreign Ministry today protesting the Japanese Air Force's bombing of Nanjing. (National telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes' Massacre in Nanjing and Guangzhou Incites Global Outrage and Disgust</h3>
<p>Considered the Most Heinous Atrocity in Modern History; The Times of London States that it Would Promote Our Unity</p>
<p>[London] The Times commented today on Japan's reply to the incident of injuring Ambassador Hsu Shih-ying, and also touched upon recent events in China, stating that Japan's formal reply was much more satisfactory than the previous reply. However, since the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson claimed that non-combatants would not be attacked and the rights and interests of foreigners would not be violated, how can today's inhumane bombing of Nanjing be explained? The newspaper stated that such bombing has aroused the anger and disgust of various countries, and British public opinion is particularly outraged by Japan's use of such strange methods to force the Chinese people to "show sincerity." It is generally believed that if China had the power to retaliate with air strikes, the Japanese would not dare to do this. The Japanese are so arrogant and reckless, it is truly disgusting. The Times continued, in this undeclared war in China, there has been no sign of a state collapse so far. China's resistance may force the Japanese military to further increase the war budget, and further unite the Chinese people. The surrender of the Chinese Communist Party to the Central Government is enough to show that the policies of the Japanese military have achieved the propaganda achievements of the Soviet Union in fifteen years in the past three years, and have promoted national unity that could not be achieved. The Times also said that the Japanese people may not have been willing to accept mediation a month ago, but in the future, neutral countries whose interests are affected will inevitably come forward to mediate peace. (Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] British Conservative newspapers believe that the government has reason to consider Japan's reply regarding the injury of Hsu Shih-ying as the end of the matter, but they express deep concern about the recent bombing of Nanjing and Guangzhou by Japanese aircraft. They believe that this type of attack deviates from Japan's assurances of concern for the safety of non-combatants and the protection of foreign rights and interests. The News Chronicle, speaking on behalf of the Liberal Party, said, "This kind of massacre is indeed the most heinous example of large-scale slaughter in modern history." The newspaper asks readers to look at the half-page photo showing an injured child lying on a stretcher, being bandaged by Boy Scouts, and asks readers to write to their representatives, requesting that countries unite to stop this inhumane bombing. The Daily Herald, speaking on behalf of the Labor Party, stated that the Japanese air force's attack on Nanjing and Guangzhou is a barbaric and uncivilized act. If civilized countries do not unite through the League of Nations to deal with it, then the fate of Nanjing today will befall the capitals of our countries tomorrow. (Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] The Morning Post, which has always favored Japan, commented today on Japan's reply to the case of Ambassador Hsu Shih-ying being injured, saying that the large-scale bombing of Nanjing by Japanese aircraft is inconsistent with Japan's guarantee of the safety of non-combatants. Japan is using all its strength to wage war against a country that is easy to defeat in a major war but extremely difficult to conquer. Its friends in England cannot help but be alarmed by this situation. Japan is engaged in this kind of undertaking, and its economic, military, or political interests are extremely uncertain, which seems to be consuming its national strength without end. It is feared that the result will not benefit itself, but will benefit the Soviet Union. Japan is now in China and has exposed its weaknesses to the Soviet Union. (Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] British officials recently discussed the large-scale bombing of Nanjing by Japanese aircraft, saying that this kind of behavior is "extremely absurd." Although the Hsu Shih-ying case is quite serious, it is not as important as this matter. The result of the Japanese aircraft bombing Nanjing has caused many deaths and injuries to ordinary people. British people, regardless of their political affiliation, are all indignant upon hearing the news. Officials also said that there is a passage in the reply that says, "The Japanese government is eager to limit the danger to non-combatants as much as possible, and has once again issued orders to the Japanese military authorities within China, urging them to pay extreme attention to the safety of non-combatants." Now Japan is carrying out the above policy by bombing Nanjing on a large scale with aircraft, which can be said to be strange. As for the Japanese military authorities not being ordered but deciding to bomb Nanjing on their own, it is also possible, but the fact is that there has been no reaction from Tokyo on this matter. The United Kingdom, France, and the United States have separately protested to the Japanese government, but under the current circumstances, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve results. As for the British government, it will never recognize Japan's right to issue orders or make recommendations to the British authorities within China, and is determined to safeguard the rights of British diplomats, naval and military personnel, and overseas Chinese, and will continue to carry out diplomatic actions, unswervingly, so that the safety of ordinary people can be respected, and to protect British overseas Chinese in various ways. (Havas telegram from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Daily News published an editorial today saying that Japan actually warned the ambassadors of various countries to stay away from Nanjing, which is "reckless, unparalleled." The response of various countries should be very clear, that is, countries should unite and refuse to move. The Evening Star mentioned the recent statements by US Secretary of State Hull and British Foreign Secretary Eden calling for peace, saying, "If the words of sane and responsible politicians were effective, then mankind would have already moved towards a peaceful world. Unfortunately, as seen in Spain and China, empty words are still no match for cannons." (Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the Japanese aircraft bombing of Nanjing, French newspapers of both the left and right wings have unanimously criticized it. Le Petit Parisien reported, "Some say that attacking the other side's civilians to demoralize and subdue them is a method of warfare, and in order to achieve the goal, it is permissible to dismember the limbs of babies and destroy innocent families, and even hospitals and schools should not be spared. For the sake of military victory and the glory of the army, civilians must be destroyed by bombing. Although this is not the original intention of the invaders, there is nothing that can be done about it. Is that really the case? When humanity has reached this point, what else is there to say?" L'Ère Nouvelle, the newspaper of the Radical Socialist Party, reported, "Geneva was shocked to hear about the Japanese aircraft bombing of Nanjing. The most powerful view of the League of Nations personnel is that if countries can help China defeat the aggressor, it would be a great contribution to the cause of peace." The London correspondent of the right-wing Le Figaro declared, "British public opinion is at its boiling point, and the British government believes that the situation in the Far East is so serious that protests alone are not enough, and has not issued new instructions to Ambassador Craigie in Japan. The British government may consult with the United States and take necessary measures to protect the safety and interests of overseas Chinese in Nanjing."

<h3>Chang Peng-chun's Speech on Japanese Atrocities</h3>
<p>Listeners in Geneva Were Moved</p>
<p>[Geneva] A conference initiated by the Chinese delegation was held here last night. The President of the International Academy presided over the meeting. First, Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, gave the opening speech. After the chairman's introduction, Professor Chang Pengchun of Nankai University gave a speech to the public, titled "Behind the Chinese Front." He said that China is a new-style country, engaged in resistance with calm determination and orderly measures. Its bright sacrifices have aroused the world's surprise. The world is paying attention to two questions: First, why is China forced to become a combatant country? To answer this question, one must know: ㊀ The unity of the true people in times of national crisis, ㊁ The trust in national leaders, ㊂ Maintaining the order of national organizations. China possesses the above three conditions, so it can resist. First, what will be the result of this war? When we answer this question, there are more obvious things: Japan wants to fulfill its ambitions in China, and China refuses to obey Japan's orders. Today, China's unexpectedly strong resistance is continuing. The expected result is the freedom of China, which is fond of peace and values ​​humanity, and the liberation of the Japanese people from the fanaticism of the militarist empire. Hundreds of people attended the meeting and applauded the speech, and asked various questions, all of which received satisfactory answers. The audience praised Professor Chang as the best speaker among the Chinese who have traveled to Geneva. The conference lasted three hours before it ended. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Professor Zhang Pengchun of Nankai University in China arrived here by plane this morning and gave a speech on the atrocities of the Japanese invasion of China. He also used passionate words to describe various events he had witnessed, moving many listeners. Zhang concluded that as a result of the war between China and Japan, China will surely become a free and peaceful country, and even the Japanese nation will no longer be subject to the shackles of the militarist fanatic imperialism of that country. Zhang said in his speech that small countries are resisting the Japanese invasion with calm minds and firm will. While we are living in Geneva, Japan is engaging in unprecedented large-scale cruel and inhumane behavior in China. Before I left the country, I witnessed all kinds of atrocities that I did not want to say and you would not bear to hear. Millions of lives in our country have died unnaturally, or are in great pain. All of this is enough to stimulate your feelings and arouse your sympathy, so why use redundant words? The heroic resistance of our people was not expected by the enemy, and the whole world was shocked by it. From now on, we must resist to the end, so that China can become a free, independent, peaceful and humane country, and contribute to the promotion of world peace and justice. Our country's population accounts for about one-fifth of the total human population, and its strength is great, so the countries of the world should not underestimate it." After listening to the speech, the audience applauded and welcomed it warmly. (Havas telegram from the Central News Agency on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>US Authorities Express Gratification that Ambassador Johnson Returns to His Office in Nanjing</h3>
<p>⊙Washington Since US Ambassador Johnson returned to his office in the Embassy in Nanjing, there has been no formal criticism here, but State Department officials have expressed their gratification.

However, officials have also deeply understood the resentment caused by this move in certain aspects in China and the United States. (Reuter's telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Columbia University President Denounces Japan for Violating the Nine-Power Treaty</h3>
<p>Believes that Japan, Germany, and Italy are Enemies of Democratic Countries; American Peace Groups Still Demand the Implementation of Neutrality Laws and Accuse President Roosevelt of Violating Public Opinion</p>
<p>[New York] Columbia University held its opening ceremony today. President Butler gave a very moving speech on the current state of the world. The general idea is that today's crisis in the world is unprecedented in the past thousand years of human history. Butler continued, judging from the aggressive nature of the dictatorial politics of Japan, Germany, and Italy, the danger of the dictatorial rule of Soviet Russia is far less significant. The ambitions of dictators are nothing more than to expand their power to the territories of other countries' people. The people of free countries must firmly reject this insatiable desire. Apart from this, there is absolutely no way to stop the violence. To talk about neutrality at this time is tantamount to immorality. The great enemies of democratic countries are none other than the three militaristic countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy. He also believes that the Tanaka Memorial is harmful, believing that Japan's goal is not only to conquer China, but also to conquer Asia and other countries, and there is even the possibility of going to war with the United States. Therefore, Japan's military actions in China today, as Chairman Chiang said, are based on Japan's pre-determined plan. Butler concluded that Japan's atrocities are clearly contrary to the Nine-Power Treaty and the Paris Peace Pact. If this can be tolerated, then what cannot be tolerated? (National Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the conflict between China and Japan, various American pacifist groups have recently issued declarations demanding that the government immediately implement neutrality laws, and publicly accusing President Roosevelt of disregarding public opinion and pursuing contradictory policies. They said, if our country cooperates with the League of Nations to seek a peaceful solution to the current situation between China and Japan, then why increase the US military presence in the Far East? If the government does not protect American expatriates in China who refuse to evacuate despite the government's advice, then why send naval and army forces to China? The crisis of disputes caused by American private merchant ships transporting munitions to China and Japan still exists, so why doesn't the government implement neutrality laws? President Roosevelt's ban on government-owned ships transporting munitions to China and Japan is an incomplete measure, which only harms China but does not harm Japan. The reason for this is unknown. Is President Roosevelt unable to implement neutrality laws because he is under pressure from arms dealers? What should be noted here is that although American pacifists and isolationists are demanding the implementation of neutrality laws, after the news of the US Ambassador to China Johnson moving to a gunboat to work came out, the general reaction here was extremely fierce. State Department personnel were shocked by this, believing that if the credibility of the United States is indeed damaged, then the national public opinion will inevitably fiercely resist and advocate action. As for the US government's first oral protest regarding Japan's large-scale bombing of Nanjing, it was commented on by officials here that this move was made in consideration of the above two opposing trends, and that although the oral protest by US Ambassador to Japan Grew had no effect, the subsequent written protest may not be able to influence the determination of the Japanese naval authorities. (Havas telegram from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the matter of US Ambassador to China Johnson moving from the city of Nanjing to a gunboat to work, it is rumored that the ambassador was ordered to do so, which has caused a bad impression among the general public here. The State Department recently clarified that, according to Ambassador Johnson's report, the various rumors are not true. The reason for leaving the embassy was that it was inconvenient to allow embassy personnel to risk danger, so it was decided to move to the gunboat "Luzon" to continue working and maintain contact with the Chinese government. In addition, there is absolutely no intention to leave Nanjing. (Central News Agency telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japan's Military Expansion Causes Increasing Economic Panic</h3>
<p>Imports Exceed Exports by 47 Million Yuan in August; Huge Losses in Shipping on All Routes</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japan's invasion of China and the use of troops against China have greatly affected its foreign trade. Imports have increased sharply, while exports have decreased sharply. According to the temporary statistics released by the Ministry of Finance, in August of this year, the foreign trade of the Japanese Empire (including mainland Japan, Korea, Taiwan, etc.) was short by 54,000,000 yuan, while in the same month last year, there was a surplus of approximately the same amount. In August last year, exports were 257,900,000 yuan and imports were 203,500,000 yuan. In August this year, exports were only 167,000,000 yuan, while imports reached 314,700,000 yuan. According to this, business people claim that if the war lasts for a long time, Japan will experience great financial, economic, and monetary difficulties. In addition, according to a report released by the Osaka Statistics Bureau, in August of this year, Japan's shipping in North China decreased by 84.6% compared with August of last year, shipping in Central and South China decreased by 76.2%, and shipping in the Dutch East Indies, Siam, Vietnam, and the Philippines also decreased by 62.2%. Shipping in the three northeastern provinces decreased by 15%. (National Telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Japanese Threats Have Other Purposes</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] On the 20th of this month, the commander of the enemy's Third Fleet warned foreign envoys stationed in Nanjing, advising them to withdraw from our capital before noon on the 21st and to move the warships of various countries anchored in Xiaguan to avoid being bombed by enemy planes. According to a foreign observer in Nanjing, anyone with a sense of self-respect would find this kind of action difficult to accept. We are unwilling to consider this unreasonable request, but we also feel that this kind of action by the Japanese may contain more sinister purposes and is not just a superficial and simple good-intentioned advice. On the one hand, Japan is sending a large number of first-class diplomats and politicians to lobby the great powers to explain Japan's position on invading China in order to gain international sympathy. On the other hand, it is using this kind of cunning threat to test the reactions of various countries. The bombing of Nanjing is one thing, but it is feared that various countries will unknowingly accept its instructions, which is tantamount to providing it with a way to enter diplomacy.

<h3>The Development of Our Economy is Still Limitless</h3>

<p>[London] The Financial Times commented on the report of Sir Bell, the Commercial Counselor of the British Embassy in China, saying that if China's entire economic structure is not shaken by the Japanese invasion, then how will its progress be? This report has clearly explained it. However, China's resilience is so great that even if Japan wins easily, China's future economic development can still be as described in the report. China's actual and potential relations with Western countries, especially with the United Kingdom, are of great significance. This cannot be overstated.

<h3>Britain is Brewing an International Conference to Discuss the Sino-Japanese Issue</h3>
<p>It Can Only Be Realized With the Agreement of the United States; Speculation on the Views of the Australian Representative</p>
<p>[Geneva] Britain launched a movement today to remove the Sino-Japanese issue from the League of Nations Assembly and instead hand it over to an independent world conference to discuss effective solutions. Britain is now hoping to cooperate with the United States. The meeting place will probably be in London. According to a British spokesperson, this plan can only be realized after contact with Washington. Only countries with interests in the Far East will be limited to participating in this conference. (National Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] The public opinion here attaches great importance to the proposal of Australian Representative Bruce at the League of Nations Assembly to convene an international conference to discuss the Far Eastern situation. It is generally believed that this proposal may have been agreed to by British politicians in advance. The Daily Mail reported that if this conference can be convened, all relevant countries will be invited to participate. London is the most suitable place for the meeting because of this. The Australian representative's proposal was first obtained with the British government's consent and permission. It is said that the countries invited to participate in the conference are the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, the British Commonwealth, Soviet Russia, and Germany. According to the Geneva correspondent of the News Chronicle, the British government welcomes this type of conference. (National Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] The Executive Committee of the opposition Liberal Party held a meeting at the party clubhouse today and passed a resolution stating, "The League of Nations has failed to stop Japan's invasion of China and has also failed to stop countries from interfering in the Spanish civil war. The collective security system has collapsed, which is regrettable." For the present plan, if we want to avoid a world war, the only way is to strengthen the League of Nations. Prior to this, Johnson, a key figure in the party, gave a speech saying that if the United States can sincerely cooperate with the League of Nations, then Japan's aggressive actions in the Far East can be easily stopped. The British government must invite the United States to cooperate on the Far Eastern issue and inform them that we are prepared to negotiate an economic agreement with them.

<h3>Japanese Intellectuals Denounce the Warlords</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reported on the 14th of this month that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department recently arrested a lawyer named Cheng Morihiro, who spread anti-war ideas. His recent article "Admonishing Militarists" was sent to foreign newspapers, discussing the Sino-Japanese War and denouncing Japanese warlords. The Metropolitan Police Department is currently interrogating him strictly. It is also said that Cheng Mori was once a lecturer at Meiji University, which shows a glimpse of the anti-war atmosphere among Japanese intellectuals. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>The French Ministry Plans to Release Minor Offenders</h3>

<h3>Franco-Italian Discussions on the Spanish Question</h3>
<p>French Suggestions Under Italian Consideration; Italy Seemingly Inclined to Renew Cooperation with the League of Nations</p>
<p>[Geneva] Following a meeting this morning between French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos and Italian Minister to Switzerland, Baron Bova Scoppa, they met again this afternoon for forty minutes. They thoroughly discussed the Spanish issue and how to ease the resulting tensions in Europe. Delbos raised several questions, and Bova Scoppa has requested instructions from his government, which he will answer upon receiving them. Delbos subsequently informed British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Cranborne, of the results of his meeting with Bova Scoppa. Sources claim that as a result of the Franco-Italian talks, Italy may resume cooperation with the League of Nations. According to well-informed sources, several Latin American delegations, particularly the Uruguayan delegation, plan to submit a draft resolution to the current session of the League of Nations General Assembly, advocating for the invitation of Italy to resume cooperation with the League. The wording of this draft is reportedly approved by major powers and may list various arguments to promote the resolution of the Abyssinian question. (Central News Agency, Geneva, 22nd)</p>
<p>⊙Geneva Following a meeting between French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos and Italian Minister to Switzerland, Baron Bova Scoppa, yesterday, he did not meet with the Italian Minister again today. Therefore, well-informed sources believe that the Italian government has not yet made a decision on the questions raised by Delbos yesterday, namely the joint adherence of all relevant countries to the non-intervention policy in the Spanish Civil War. It is generally believed that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Chancellor Hitler will meet on the 25th of this month. Before the two meet, Italy is unlikely to make a decision on the Spanish issue. (Central News Agency, Geneva, 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] News from Geneva indicates that Bova Scoppa assured Delbos that reports of Italy sending reinforcements to Spain to assist the Nationalist forces are inaccurate. British officials were originally concerned that if Italy did send reinforcements to Spain, French public opinion would force the French government to abolish the current surveillance measures at the Franco-Spanish border. However, due to the repeated talks between Delbos and Bova Scoppa, these concerns have been alleviated. Furthermore, French Ambassador Corbin paid a visit to Foreign Secretary Eden at 3 PM today to discuss the Franco-Italian talks. (Central News Agency, Geneva, 22nd)</p>
<p>⊙London The talks between French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos and Italian Minister to Switzerland, Baron Bova Scoppa, in Geneva yesterday, are being followed with great interest here, as they are seen as the beginning of a thaw in Franco-Italian relations. The outcome may bring Franco-Italian relations to the same level as the existing relations between Britain and Italy. It is generally hoped that the outcome of the Franco-Italian talks will strengthen the policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. Some people emphasized that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is about to visit Germany. For his own sake, it would be more advantageous for him to assume responsibility for the liaison between countries based on the results of recent talks than to visit Germany as the leader of an isolated nation. (Central News Agency, Geneva, 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Mediterranean surveillance issue, naval experts from Britain, France, and Italy will soon hold a meeting in Paris to discuss the technical aspects of Italy's participation in the surveillance. British naval officials believe that the best solution is for the fleets of Britain, France, and Italy to take turns carrying out the surveillance. The British Admiralty does not fully support a plan for a mixed formation of the three countries' fleets to jointly carry out the surveillance. Therefore, it will instruct its naval experts to propose a suggestion at the Paris meeting that a certain sea lane in the Mediterranean, especially the sea lane from Italian Tripoli in Africa to the north, be entrusted to British, French, and Italian destroyers to take turns conducting surveillance, each under the command of its own national commander and not mixed together.

<h3>Registration of Taiwanese in Xiamen Completed</h3>
<p>[Xiamen] The municipal government has completed the registration of over 1,120 Taiwanese residents in Xiamen. 120 Chinese merchants who falsely claimed Taiwanese nationality have repented. A second notice was issued on the 23rd, promulgating eight articles of measures regarding Chinese merchants taking over businesses from Taiwanese and Taiwanese withdrawing from business ventures, requiring signed statements to ensure sincerity. Furthermore, farms and factories belonging to Taiwanese, valued at millions, have been placed under the management of a committee to continue production, accommodating Taiwanese Chinese returning from overseas and unemployed citizens.

<h3>Yunnan, Guangdong, and Guangxi Currency in General Circulation in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>[Nanchang] The four banks of China, Communications, and Agriculture in Nanchang are now accepting Yunnan and Guangxi banknotes and assisting in the exchange of Yunnan banknotes. The exchange rate is two yuan of new Yunnan banknotes or ten yuan of old Yunnan banknotes for one yuan of legal tender. In the future, new and old banknotes issued by Yunnan Province and banknotes from Guangdong and Guangxi can be used here. (Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>War Zone Service Corps Receives Comfort Supplies</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The War Zone Service Corps of the Military Affairs Commission has recently received a large number of donations, jewelry, comfort supplies, and gas masks, including four radios. These radios are urgently needed by various wounded soldier hospitals. It is hoped that compatriots from all walks of life will actively donate to express their care for the wounded soldiers who are defending the country. (Central News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Discusses Sino-Japanese Issue; Germany Does Not Participate in Advisory Committee</h3>
<p>⊙Berlin According to well-informed sources here, Germany has decided to decline the invitation from the Secretary-General of the League of Nations to participate in the Advisory Committee to jointly discuss the Sino-Japanese incident. Political figures strongly assert that Germany's refusal is due to the presence of individuals such as Spanish Prime Minister Negrín in the League of Nations, who have publicly attacked Chancellor Hitler. (23rd, National Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙Berlin After receiving a letter from the Advisory Committee of the League of Nations, the German government has instructed the German Consul-General in Geneva to reply to the League that Germany cannot participate in such meetings for well-known reasons. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japan Expresses Deep Apology for Shooting British Ambassador</h3>
<p>Acknowledges Incident as Mistake by Japanese Military; Pledges Not to Massacre Non-Combatants</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the injury of British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the Japanese government has formally submitted a reply to Britain expressing deep regret. The Japanese note states that two Japanese aircraft bombed and strafed what they believed to be two military vehicles or transport trucks carrying Chinese soldiers. Therefore, the Japanese government believes that the incident may have been caused by the aircraft mistaking the Ambassador's car for a military vehicle or transport truck. The note further states that the Japanese government is willing to take appropriate steps when it is proven that Japanese aircraft pilots have caused death or injury to people of the first nation, whether intentionally or through negligence, and that the Japanese government has now instructed Japanese troops stationed in China to provide the most cautious protection to non-combatants. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, recently sent a note to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, stating, "Regarding the attack on the Ambassador of the enemy country to China by two aircraft near Shanghai on the 26th of last month, the note submitted by Your Excellency on the 21st of this month has been forwarded by this Ambassador to the enemy country's government. This Ambassador has now received instructions from the enemy country's government stating that it is very pleased to receive Your Excellency's note and considers this case closed." (Havas, Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>[London] London believes that the Japanese government has made painstaking efforts to investigate the facts and acknowledges that there may be differences regarding the location of the Ambassador's injury. The important purpose of the original British protest was to ensure the protection of non-combatants during the war in China. Therefore, the Japanese government's declaration that it has reissued instructions to the Japanese army in China is welcomed here. It is believed that the Japanese side will take steps to avoid the recurrence of similar incidents. Furthermore, the apology requested by the British government has now been made, and the Japanese note has explained the reasons why the pilot cannot be punished. In any case, it is generally believed that the occurrence of this unfortunate incident is sufficient to ensure a higher degree of caution on the part of combatants in the Sino-Japanese War in the future. The original British protest requested: (1) a formal apology from the Japanese government to the British government; (2) appropriate punishment of the perpetrator; and (3) a guarantee from the Japanese authorities that they will take necessary steps to avoid the recurrence of similar incidents. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>[London] After studying the Japanese government's formal reply regarding the injury of British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen this morning, British Foreign Secretary Eden and Prime Minister Chamberlain believe that this case can be closed. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<h3>A Message to the People of North America</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>On the eastern and western shores of the Pacific Ocean reside the United States and China. Both are nations vast in land and rich in resources. Both are peoples who cherish peace. For many years, there have been no barriers between the American and Chinese peoples. There has only been cultural exchange and mutually beneficial trade. And in the ongoing political disputes that have arisen in the Far East in recent years, we have seen that the people of North America have always adopted a particularly concerned attitude. Yes, the United States has founded many cultural institutions in China and has established many commercial relationships. The United States is also the initiator of several important international treaties in the Far East. Therefore, the United States advocates maintaining China's open door and respecting the sanctity of treaties in the Far East. These propositions are in complete agreement with China's aim of maintaining peace in the Far East. So, we often think that on our path of striving for peace, the United States, like many other peace-loving countries, should be a good friend who works hand in hand with us.</p>
<p>In recent years, China has clearly been caught in a fate completely different from that of the United States. We have suffered the aggression of our neighboring Japanese imperialism. Based on their continental policy, Japanese militarists began in 1931 to seize our three northeastern provinces, then annex Rehe, and further step into Shanhaiguan, gradually carving out our Hebei and Chahar provinces. We have risen up to fight the aggressors, but for various reasons, our struggle has never fully achieved its original aim of driving out the enemies who are invading our territory and disrupting peace in the Far East. However, during our struggle, the voices of sympathy and support given to us by the people of North America have often been something we have been grateful for. We think that one day, the people of China will unite under the banner of resistance and make a final fight against the aggressors—a fight that is not only related to the fate of China, but also to the fate of the entire democratic and peaceful world. At that time, America's sympathetic support for us will certainly have a more concrete and active manifestation.</p>
<p>Now, our final struggle has begun. Japanese imperialism provoked the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and created the Shanghai Incident, which has forced our entire nation to unite under the banner of resistance, launching a sacred war of resistance for national freedom and world peace. We are confident of ultimate victory because not only is the fighting spirit of our entire nation very firm, but the majority of world sympathy is also on our side. Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have all clearly expressed their opposition to Japan's acts of aggression. Even Germany and Italy, which have some kind of agreement with Japan, feel that Japan's exploitation of the situation at this time is too unsightly and have not given obvious consent. However, in this environment that we are so proud of, there is a major shortcoming, and that is that the United States, which we have always considered to be the most sympathetic to China, has suddenly shown an attitude of hesitation and bewilderment. American isolationists advocate withdrawing from the Far East. American pacifist groups want to implement the Neutrality Act. The White House authorities have warned American residents in China that if they do not evacuate, they should be responsible for their own safety. Later, it even announced an embargo on the shipment of military supplies to both China and Japan. Recently, when the Japanese aggressors threatened to devastate our capital by air, the diplomatic personnel of other countries showed no fear and indicated that they could not evacuate. However, the American diplomatic personnel were the only exception, moving to warships to work. These hesitant and uncertain expressions have already caused reactions of surprise and even disappointment in the minds of the average Chinese person. Not only in China, but many people around the world who care about international justice and peace in the Far East cannot help but ask in dismay, "Even if the United States is determined to abandon the commercial foundations it has cultivated in the Far East for many years, will it abandon its consistent policy of maintaining peace and respecting treaties?"</p>
<p>This doubt and disappointment has been greatly reduced after Secretary of State Hull lodged a strong protest with Tokyo against the Japanese military's bombing of Chinese civilian cities and destroying American interests in China. However, we feel that to completely eliminate all the doubts and disappointments caused by the aforementioned actions, more active and concrete expressions are needed. And we believe that with the glorious tradition of the United States cherishing democracy and freedom, with the great spirit of the American people who have always fought for justice, and with the active attitude that the United States has held for many years towards peace in the Far East, such further expression is not impossible.</p>
<p>However, we know that we absolutely do not want to influence American policy with our own interests. Therefore, what expressions the United States should have regarding the current serious situation in the Far East, and what steps it should take, are not for China to inquire about. But in the midst of the ardent hopes we hold for the United States, we feel that there are a few points of view that should be explained to the people of North America. First, as we pointed out earlier, our current war of resistance against the Japanese aggressors is not only for our own survival, but also for peace in the Far East and even the whole world. Second, we hope that the United States will not adopt the current policy of hesitation and bewilderment, because this policy is sufficient to hinder China's strength in the war of resistance and encourage Japan's aggressive ambitions, and the result is sufficient to increase the threat of Japanese aggressors to world peace. This is clearly contrary to the original intentions of the American people who have always sympathized with China and loved peace. Third, we ask that the United States have a more active expression of the serious situation in the Far East. This is not to make many peaceful Americans enter the whirlpool of bloodshed in the Far East, nor is it to drag the United States into the boiling pot of international diplomatic disputes. In fact, China's hope for peace is the same as that of other peace-loving countries. But when the aggressors are advancing step by step, we have no choice but to fight the aggressors to the death, even at the risk of bloodshed. And we can think that if the peace-loving countries do not use active force to put out the aggressors at present, then their threat will eventually directly reach every peace-loving country.</p>
<p>The above only expresses a few of our opinions. We hope that the wise people of North America will accept them. Finally, we would like to borrow a few sentences from the book "Conflict in the Pacific," published last year by the American Foreign Policy Association, to conclude: "In the future, there are several possibilities for the evolution of the situation in the Pacific—either Japan continues its aggression without being stopped, or China rises up to defend itself, or one or two Western powers have to rise up to stop Japan's advance, or there is a solution where countries act collectively to stop war and aggression and ensure lasting peace." This is the opinion of an American diplomat. We believe that the American people will get the best judgment from it.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the International Red Cross Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>To Assist with All Wartime Work in China</p>
<p>Colonel Walter Veer, a special representative of the Swiss International Red Cross, arrived in Shanghai on a French postal ship the day before yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. That evening, the Chinese Red Cross Society held a banquet for the representative at the International Hotel, presided over by Honorary Vice President Dr. Yen Hui-ching. The Swiss Deputy Consul, Vice Presidents of the Society Du Yuesheng and Liu Hongsheng, all executive directors and supervisors, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office Yu Ming, Director of the Health Bureau Li Ting'an, and more than thirty others attended. During the banquet, Dr. Yen first delivered a welcoming speech, saying that the history of the Society is younger than that of advanced countries around the world, and although it has various undertakings, it is limited by economic resources and talent and has not been able to fully develop. Now that Colonel Veer has come to China to guide it, its work will be able to proceed smoothly. The Swiss Deputy Consul then delivered an introductory speech, saying that the Red Cross originated in Switzerland, and Switzerland is a country known to the world for its peace. The mission of Colonel Veer's visit to China is to assist the needs of your Society to the extent possible. Then, Colonel Walter Veer delivered a reply, saying that the highest organ of the World Red Cross is the Red Cross League in Paris, and the Swiss International Red Cross. The League handles all peacetime work, while this Society assists all countries during wartime. I came to China very hastily this time, and I was unable to prepare adequately. I hope that everyone present will not hesitate to give me advice so that I can complete this mission. It would be a great honor. At 9:00 PM, everyone parted with pleasure.</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters and Others Jointly Assist Unemployed Workers</h3>
<p>Plan to First Register Unemployed Workers in the War Zone; West Shanghai Joint Association Calls on All Sectors to Substantially Aid</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Association, in view of the complete shutdown of factories in the war zone after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers suddenly unemployed, had written to party and government agencies to properly formulate concrete measures for assistance. It is reported that it has been agreed upon that the Municipal Government, Municipal Party Headquarters, Local Association, Labor Association, and General Labor Union will jointly organize the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee. Following the example of the January 28th Incident, five to ten registration offices will be set up first, distributed in the western part of Shanghai, the Public Concession, the French Concession, and other areas, to handle the registration of unemployed workers. Then, according to the skills of workers in various industries, jobs or relief will be introduced separately. The Association has now started publicizing and is actively proceeding. Unemployed workers can take this opportunity to register actively to avoid long-term unemployment. The Shanghai West Joint Benefit Association, in view of the sharp increase in the number of unemployed workers after the Shanghai war, exceeding hundreds of thousands, who are displaced and whose livelihoods are precarious, in addition to actively planning relief measures to provide accommodation, also made suggestions to the competent authorities and all sectors to provide substantial assistance together. It is reported that the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau have begun to handle registration first, but the number of people is large and the procedures are complicated, and it is feared that it cannot be completed in a short period of time. If it is delayed any further, hundreds of thousands of workers will inevitably become starving corpses waiting for death. Therefore, the Association believes that relieving unemployed workers is as urgent as a fire, and the most rapid method should be used to provide substantial accommodation first to stabilize their lives. This is the most important plan. The measures include creating temporary factories or establishing temporary production and sales offices, to ensure that workers' abilities are fully utilized to achieve wartime production cooperation. The expenses should be borne by the legal groups in this city, assisting the authorities in jointly promoting it, so that it can be realized in a very short period of time, and the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of workers can be solved immediately. The Association is now appealing and making suggestions to all sectors of this city based on the above principles, urging everyone to rise up and advocate for it.</p>
<h3>British Ships Relax Quotas to Carry as Many Refugees as Possible</h3>
<p>London Cables Back, Allowing the Quota to Hong Kong to Increase Twelvefold; Enemy Navy Outside the Wusong Estuary Again Adds Obstacles</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the biggest problem in Shanghai society has been the reception and repatriation of refugees. After the enemy implemented a blockade of our country's coastline, national public opinion could not pass, and to transport refugees out of the country, it was necessary to hire foreign merchant ships. Britain, Italy, and other countries, for the sake of sending non-combatants from Shanghai, the refugees who had been innocently affected by the war, all acted righteously and worked hard to assist in the process. The Municipal Council first rented the Ningxing ship, flying its flag, to carry</p>
<p>Ningbo Natives Leaving</p>
<p>to Ningbo. The enemy naval authorities were unable to refuse, but in fact, they did not allow it to load, and almost bombarded the Ningbo ship. It then changed to renting the British ship Shenfu and the Italian ship Endeavor to continue sending them, but it was repeatedly unreasonably obstructed and repeatedly searched. There was also the Jiangbei Fellow Villagers Association, which rented the Wuhu, Wuxue, and Pinghe ships of Swire &amp;amp; Butterfield, intending to send 100,000 refugees from Shanghai to Jiangbei. After releasing 2,000 people the first time, the second time it was</p>
<p>Obstructed by Enemy Warships</p>
<p>It was not allowed to carry refugees from Shanghai out of the country. This matter is still under negotiation. The refugees will suffer from cold and hunger because they have no clothes or quilts. If this negotiation is successful, 10,000 people can be sent to Jiangbei first. There are also those going to Hong Kong and Guangdong. Swire &amp;amp; Butterfield, based on the principle of compassion, can transport an unlimited number of refugees going to Guangdong. The Nan Hua class ships leaving are chartered by charitable groups in Shanghai and Guangdong, sending at least 3,000 people every week. However, to Hong Kong, because the passengers of each ship must be</p>
<p>According to the Quotas Allowed by the Hong Kong Government</p>
<p>No more than one person is allowed to be carried, otherwise its passenger license will be revoked. This is the rule. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the number of passengers going to Hong Kong has greatly increased, and Hong Kong hotels and houses were already full, but there were still many more to come. According to the regulations, each ship of Swire &amp;amp; Butterfield is only allowed to carry 12 Chinese to Hong Kong. Now, the two companies have cabled London to ask the government for instructions. The British government, in view of the tragic bombing of Shanghai, the death of civilians every day, often dozens or hundreds of people, has compassion for these innocent civilians</p>
<p>Suffering this Catastrophe</p>
<p>All mankind should be moved to pity. It cabled back to Shanghai, approving the accommodation, increasing the quota of Chinese to Hong Kong on each ship by twelve times, allowing each ship to carry 156 Chinese to Hong Kong each time (but not in the name of refugees). It is said that the refugees in Shanghai can leave the country soon. Recently, because so many refugees from Shanghai have been sent to Nan Hua, the enemy navy has been forcibly obstructing it outside the Wusong estuary since Wednesday this week, causing great difficulties for those being sent to Guangdong and those going to Hong Kong voluntarily.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Rear Production in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Purchasing Cotton and Cocoons in Various Counties</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the most noteworthy thing has been the maintenance of rear production. What is particularly needed now is the cotton, cocoons, and rice from the autumn harvest. Jiangsu Province produces a large quantity of cotton and cocoons. Recently, because the yarn and silk industries have stagnated, both autumn cocoons and cotton have faced difficulties in finding outlets. Although prices have plummeted, no one is interested. This phenomenon is a very serious problem. It is reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Guiding Office for Industrial and Agricultural Production has already begun this maintenance work. Among them, the cotton and cocoon projects have already started purchasing, setting standard prices, and establishing cocoon collection points and cotton collection points respectively to handle matters such as cotton and cocoon purchase, processing, storage, safekeeping, transportation, and sales. It has been found that the cotton collection areas are Shanghai, Taicang, Jiading, Baoshan, Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, Chongming, Yancheng, Funing, Dongtai, Rugao, and other counties. The cotton purchasing work is entrusted to the Agricultural Products Transportation and Sales Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank and the Trust Department of the Jiangsu Bank. Among them, the cocoon purchasing work in Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan has already started. A committee for purchasing autumn cocoons in the 26th year of the Republic of China has been established to preside over the operation, using the original sericulture improvement areas of various counties in Jiangsu Province as implementing agencies, including Wuxi, Jintan, Wujin, Wuxian, Huaiyin, Yangzhou, Yixing, Jiangyin, Haimen, Wujiang, Jinyang, Danyang, Jingjiang, Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Jurong, Jiangning, Changshu, Rugao, Jinhu, Yizheng, Baoying, Gaoyou, Nantong, and more than twenty other counties. The standard price for fresh cocoons is set at thirty-five yuan per city dan. In addition, the purchase of rice is also said to be in the planning stage.</p>
<h3>Persuading People to Buy National Salvation Bonds Actively and Tirelessly</h3>
<p>中華 Book Company Subscribes for 150,000; National Women's Circles Launch Fundraising</p>
<p>中華 Book Company</p>

<h3>The City Party Headquarters Will Discuss the Distribution of One-Day Income Donations Today</h3>
<p>This Donation Will Be Contributed to the Government for Use</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Party Headquarters, in order to promote the national one-day income contribution movement, convened various agencies and organizations in the city last winter to form the Shanghai Chinese People's One-Day Income Promotion Committee to handle the collection of citizens' one-day income donations, with very good results. Now that the aforementioned donations, which are deposited in various banks, are still numerous, they should be comprehensively distributed and used for national purposes. Therefore, an emergency meeting of the Promotion Committee will be convened today at 2 p.m. to discuss the distribution method of the previously collected donation funds.</p>

<h3>Four Hundred Foreigners Return to Shanghai from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Life in Hong Kong is Extremely Uncomfortable; Families Reunited, Showing Joy</p>
<p>When the Shanghai battle first started, many foreigners in the city moved to Hong Kong. Life there was inconvenient and prices were high, so they preferred to return to Shanghai and listen to the sounds of cannons and bombs again. The French ship Hirano Soji arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong a few days ago, carrying no fewer than four hundred foreigners who had returned. When families reunited, they all showed joy. It is expected that more people will continue to come on other ships.</p>

We firmly believe that after this, every time the enemy comes to make trouble, it will be equivalent to increasing the opportunity for our southern heroes to perform meritorious service. We respectfully send this telegram to express our congratulations and our comfort. Please take note. The Shanghai All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Shanghai Local Association."</p>
<h3>The Enemy Falsely Creates Rumors</h3>
<p>Mayor Yu Denounces Them as Groundless</p>
<p>The 大陸 Daily reported that the rumor spread by the Japanese that Mayor Yu had asked the French Consul General to hand over the southern city to the French authorities for management, and to hand over the roads outside the boundaries of the western district to the Public Concession for management, was denounced by Mayor Yu yesterday as absolutely groundless. General Manager Fessenden of the Public Works Department also said that he only learned of this matter after reading the news from the 同盟 News Agency. In addition, French Consul Ser also said that he was surprised to hear this statement, which was completely unfounded.</p>
<h3>Overall Plan for Refugee Shelters</h3>

<h3>Actively Collecting Cotton Vests Through Donations</h3>
<p>Various Circles Donate Cloth and Cotton is Also Welcome</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Comfort Committee began collecting cotton vests for soldiers, it has received enthusiastic donations from patriotic people from all walks of life, and the results have been very good. Recently, with the cooperation of the Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps, even more assistance has been provided for fundraising in the future. In the past few days, the number of items collected by the Corps alone has been considerable, and active efforts are continuing to achieve the goal of one million pieces. However, the Corps lacks vehicles for collecting and transporting cotton vests, which has caused considerable difficulties in transportation. Therefore, it is actively seeking to borrow one or two cars from all walks of life to facilitate transportation. If enthusiastic people from all walks of life are willing to lend their cars, please contact the Corps at 96577 as soon as possible so that transportation can be more convenient and fundraising can proceed quickly. It is also reported that many enthusiastic men and women have applied to the Comfort Committee, willing to volunteer to sew cotton vests. Therefore, donations of cloth and cotton from all walks of life are also very welcome. Please send them to the Shanghai Comfort Committee on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Native Place Association on Route Chaxia. If you voluntarily entrust the Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps to make them on your behalf, the limit is one yuan in national currency per piece, and please indicate the amount and number of pieces on the receipt.</p>
<h3>Southeast Medical College Decides to Move to Wuchang</h3>
<p>Classes Will Still Be Held Temporarily in Shanghai</p>
<p>After the Zhenru campus of Southeast Medical College was bombed by enemy planes, the Hujun Camp campus in the southern city could not continue due to the war. According to Guo Qiyuan, the president of the college, the college vacated its campus as soon as the Shanghai battle broke out to establish a wounded soldier hospital for the Red Cross. The college's doctors in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades also immediately went to serve, treating wounded soldiers. However, enemy planes deliberately destroyed our cultural institutions and violated international law by bombing the wounded soldier hospital and bombing Zhenru repeatedly, completely destroying the college's buildings.</p>
<p>The internal instruments, except for a small part that had been moved out in advance, were severely damaged after being destroyed. The college had been painstakingly managed since January 28th and had only recently been restored to its former state. However, it was bombed by enemy planes again, which is extremely hateful. As for the opening of the semester, the college's Hujun Camp campus in the southern city could not be opened due to the war. Currently, the college's students, except for the hundreds of students in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades, who have all gone to serve, there are two to three hundred students in the first, second, and third grades.</p>
<p>Notice of Registration</p>
<p>is being issued. After this, it is planned to move the college to a more suitable area for wartime education. However, because the college's curriculum and instruments are different from those of other universities, it has been decided to move it to Wuchang alone. Personnel are being sent to make arrangements. However, all the relocation will take time and cannot be done immediately. Therefore, the temporary opening plan is to hold classes in the college's hospital on Route Sappo. Medical talent in our country</p>
<p>is in urgent need of training. At this time of war, it is especially needed. Although the college has been destroyed by enemy planes, we have not been discouraged and will continue to work hard to find ways to restore it. As for the course schedule, it was originally six years of graduation, including four years of study and two years of internship. However, I feel that in this extraordinary period, time should not be wasted. Therefore, it has been decided to shorten the four-year course to three years as much as possible without any problems in academic knowledge. At the same time, the two-year internship will be increased to three years to serve the country. This is essential for the country to fulfill its responsibility to train talent and for individuals to gain experience.</p>
<h3>The Exchange Rate Has Been Stable Since the Outbreak of the War</h3>
<p>Legal Tender Policy is Firm; The Enemy Finds it Difficult to Take Advantage of the Situation</p>
<p>The exchange rate situation since the start of the war is something that all readers are extremely concerned about. The stability of legal tender depends entirely on whether the exchange rate can be maintained or not. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the enemy has repeatedly tried to undermine it, but our authorities have maintained it effectively, and their efforts have been in vain. Now that the full-scale war of resistance has begun and this city has been the first to be affected, it should have contracted repeatedly. However, in the forty days since August 13th, the exchange rate has actually loosened once, which was beyond the enemy's expectations. It has now turned slightly stable. The firmness and steadfastness of our country's legal tender policy can be imagined. The general situation of the exchange rate in this city since August 13th is recorded below. After August 13th, due to the early preparations made by the authorities, the credibility of legal tender increased greatly, and the financial situation was stable, which greatly undermined the enemy's policy of lightly regarding the situation and waiting for an opportunity to disrupt it. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance issued emergency measures for finance during the extraordinary period, so that the general enemy banks were at their wit's end and at a loss. They had to sell foreign exchange repeatedly in the hope of relieving the panic of legal tender. In addition, speculative bulls were forced to reach their expiration dates and dumped their positions, so the spot exchange rate fell to 1 shilling 2 pence 53125 for the British pound and 30.125 yuan for the US dollar before the end of August. Later, due to the large number of oil settlements, major foreign firms took advantage of the situation to buy, and there were also a few Chinese who entrusted foreign firms to settle on their behalf, so it tightened again to 1 shilling 2 pence 1325 for the British pound and 29.53125 yuan for the US dollar. Da Tung even ate in. However, in order to prevent problems before they occurred, the enemy banks continued to close their positions. Currently, the British pound is 1 shilling 2 pence 4375 and the US dollar is 29.8125 yuan, which is a relaxation of 1875 for the British pound and a hardening of 3125 for the US dollar compared to before the war. As for swaps, because there is a lack of short positions, they can only swap spot goods to October, and the discount is quite expensive, estimated at 1875 shillings and about half a yuan for the US dollar. In short, the exchange market in this city is particularly stable due to the prudent handling of the authorities. You must have full cash to settle foreign exchange. If we can recognize the enemy and restrict the economy, then the enemy will have no opportunity to take advantage of us.</p>
<h3>Descendant of General Qi Gives Couplets to Encourage Donations</h3>
<p>Children's Patriotic Donation</p>
<p>Qi He, a descendant of General Qi Jiguang, who pacified the Japanese pirates, lives in Shanghai and is skilled in calligraphy. In response to the request of the members of the Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps, he donated a thousand couplets to encourage compatriots who are enthusiastic about donating. Anyone who purchases national salvation bonds or anti-enemy soldier relief items for more than 50 yuan can bring the receipt to Crane Studio at 40 Moore Road to contact and receive a couplet as a souvenir. The Chinese Women's Movement Alliance delivered a silver coin of one yuan from Xue Zhaohuang, an eight-year-old child, and a pair of photo frames from a six-year-old girl yesterday through Qian Jianqiu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Alliance. The objects were all items they usually loved to play with. Now that they see the country resisting the war, they generously donated them. Their patriotism is worthy of praise.</p>
<h3>Unified Coal Transportation</h3>
<p>Handled by the Coal Management Committee</p>
<p>A large amount of coal stored by major coal companies in the city is stored in Pudong. After the coal companies register the coal with the Coal Industry Association, the association obtains a pass from the government authorities. The loading and transportation procedures are cumbersome, and disputes are often discovered. In order to facilitate the loading and transportation of coal, the Coal Consumption Management Committee is responsible for the loading and transportation of coal and the goods purchased by the owners in the future, so as to avoid unexpected disputes. The committee has notified the Coal Industry Association and the Charcoal Industry Association to comply with this.</p>

<h3>Aviation Lottery Tickets Sell Well</h3>
<p>Prizes Are Still Fully Paid by the Three Banks</p>
<p>Since the aviation lottery tickets were issued, and they are planned to be sold in large quantities in the western district, the credit has been significant. The construction of national highways and the development of aviation have received great benefits. Now that the 39th drawing is approaching, patriotic comrades are purchasing them more and more enthusiastically. According to the person in charge of Dayun Company, the company's retail, mail-order, and wholesale departments have been quite busy recently. The business situation is not only unaffected during the wartime period, but has increased compared to the past. This shows that the patriotic power of people from all walks of life is very strong. Therefore, the 40th lottery tickets continue to be issued, and they have been sent to various places in advance. The prize money for winning tickets is still fully cashed by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China. According to informed sources, recently, in order to take care of the needs of the people in the western district to purchase tickets and wholesale, the company has sent personnel to urgently find suitable housing and set up an office in the western district to facilitate and promote sales.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce Thanks the Fire Brigade</h3>
<p>The British Chamber of Commerce and the Joint Committee of the British Chambers of Commerce in China held a meeting last time and praised the members of the Public Concession Fire Brigade for taking risks and serving selflessly in various places on the night of September 18th. It was resolved that the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce would send a letter to the Public Works Department to express his gratitude. The Director-General of the Public Works Department, Franklin, received a letter from the chairman of the committee, Marshall Xie Sun, yesterday and forwarded the original letter to the Fire Chief, Dawson, asking him to convey the British Chamber of Commerce's gratitude to all the fire officers.</p>

<h3>Enemy Troops Attacked Our Liuhang Front Line on Three Routes Last Night, All of Which Were Repulsed</h3>
<p>Enemy Casualties Were Extremely Heavy on the Chaowang Temple and Mengwan Routes; Our Army's Counterattack on the Yangmu Bridge Front is Still in Fierce Battle; The Enemy Attacked Baoshan Road This Morning But Was Repulsed by Our Army</p>
<p>The newspaper received the following accurate battle report from the front line at 8 a.m. this morning: ㊀ Starting at dawn yesterday, the enemy's artillery positions in the Yanghang area fiercely bombarded our front line in Liuhang with barrages, attempting to destroy the fortifications of our army on that line. About half an hour later, hundreds of infantrymen, led by tanks, advanced along the highway from the Yong'an Bridge towards the front of our Yangmu Bridge position. Our army initially ignored them. When they arrived within the range of machine gun fire, they were swept by light and heavy machine guns. The enemy tanks retreated after fighting for a while. Dozens of enemy infantrymen were killed. We did not pursue them and suffered no casualties. ㊁ After 6 p.m. yesterday, the enemy troops, unwilling to accept the failure of the morning's frontal attack, launched a major attack on our Liuhang front line on three routes. Starting at dusk, in addition to the enemy artillery team in Yanghang, their artillery teams in the city center and Yuepu also joined in, using dense artillery fire to launch fierce attacks on our Liuhang left wing Chaowang Temple, front Yangmu Bridge, right wing Mengwan, and the line of the Tiaoban Bridge. Our artillery teams also returned fire with heavy artillery and field guns. After the artillery battle lasted for about an hour, the enemy infantrymen launched simultaneous attacks on three routes. One route advanced along the Xin'an River, about three or four hundred men, with Chaowang Temple as their destination. When the enemy troops advanced to the area east of Panjing, they were stopped by our army's mortars and heavy machine guns. Although the enemy launched several assaults, attempting to seize the Xiaohang at that location, they were eventually repulsed by the concentrated firepower of our army, and many were killed and wounded on the east bank of the river and did not dare to come to move them. One route attacked from the Yong'an Bridge area, about six or seven hundred men, still with Yangmu Bridge as their destination. Since 8 p.m. last night, they have been using tanks to launch attacks on our Yangmu Bridge position, but they have been repulsed by our army's fierce firepower. However, this route of enemy troops came with greater momentum. As of 2 a.m. this morning, they have not given up their attempt to break through the center. Our army has also used elite troops to launch a counterattack on the enemy, and fierce fighting is still in progress. One route attacked from Yangjiayan, about four or five hundred men, with Mengwan and Gujiajiao as their targets. The first encounter occurred about one kilometer southeast of Mengwan at 8:30 p.m. last night. After about half an hour of engagement, the central troops of our army feigned defeat and retreated. The enemy immediately dispatched a small squad of infantry, about seventy or eighty men, equipped with light machine guns, to advance to the front of Mengwan. At this time, the ambushing troops on our left and right lines suddenly rose up and attacked from both sides. At four o'clock, our central troops also immediately turned around and attacked. The enemy troops were immediately surrounded by our army and fell into bitter fighting. Although they had reserves to support them, they were eventually defeated in a panic. Many were killed by our army, and few survived. Dozens of rifles and several light machine guns were abandoned and seized by us. Our army then took advantage of the victory to pursue, advancing the position by dozens of meters. After twelve o'clock, the enemy troops returned, but although they launched several assaults, they were not as numerous as before and did not dare to advance easily, so they were all repulsed by us. As of 4 a.m. this morning, this route of enemy troops did not dare to attack. ㊂ The situation on all routes in Shanghai last night and this morning was very quiet, and there were no changes on the front lines.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that since yesterday morning, the enemy troops' frontal attacks on our Liuhang area have been very fierce. In the evening, the enemy concentrated artillery fire and fiercely bombarded our Yangmu Bridge, Mengwan, Chaowang Temple, and Tiaoban Bridge lines. Enemy infantry immediately launched several assaults under the cover of artillery fire. Our army fought bravely to meet the enemy, but the enemy did not succeed. As of 2 a.m. this morning (the 24th), fierce fighting was still in progress.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Takahashi Detachment Decimated</h3>
<p>Composed of the 1st and 2nd Regiments, encompassing six battalions. Five battalions were annihilated by our forces, yielding countless spoils of war. One remaining battalion remains on alert in the Liuhe area.</p>
<p>The enemy Takahashi Detachment was formed in Taiwan on the 14th of this month, departed Taiwan on the 16th, and landed in Wusong on the 18th. It was then transported by motor vehicle to the north of Luodian. This detachment was composed of the 1st and 2nd Regiments, with the 1st Regiment commanded by Samura and the 2nd Regiment by Shigezumi. Each regiment had three battalions. From the evening of the 19th of this month until the evening of the 21st, they launched a fierce attack on the right flank of our [illegible characters]. Initially, the detachment used one battalion to guard Liuhe Town, and then used about one regiment's worth of troops to attack near Sucun. After being defeated by our troops [illegible characters], they continued the attack with another regiment. In the afternoon, the main force of the detachment attacked us. As of the night before last, over four hundred enemy troops had been killed by our forces in Yaozhai alone, and we captured two heavy machine guns, over ten light machine guns, over one hundred rifles, and countless spoils of war. Of the detachment, only one battalion remained on alert in Liuhe, while the remaining five battalions were almost completely annihilated by our forces.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Attacked Zhabei This Morning</h3>
<p>They were driven back and fled.</p>
<p>This morning at 8:00 AM, enemy troops attacked our Baoshan Road, and there was a burst of artillery fire, firing indiscriminately. Our troops calmly waited until the enemy troops approached, then unleashed a dense barrage of machine gun and mortar fire. The enemy troops fled in disarray. Afterwards, they focused on shelling our positions with artillery, disrupting our rear. Only a few houses were destroyed. Our artillery also returned fire, and many shells hit areas such as North Sichuan Road and Hongkou Park, after which the enemy artillery fire ceased.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Admits 19 Deaths in Last Month's Air Battle on the 21st</h3>
<p>Reported by "Tokyo Asahi Shimbun"</p>
<p>Over ten enemy heavy bombers attempted to launch a night raid on Nanjing around 4:00 AM on August 21st. Our air force intercepted them over Yangzhou, and engaged in a fierce battle for half an hour. Four enemy aircraft were shot down by our forces. On the same day, our air force attacked enemy positions in Shanghai, and shot down two enemy fighter planes. On that day, the enemy lost six aircraft and nineteen airmen. Yesterday, we received the September 15th edition of the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, which reported that the Yokosuka Naval Port had confirmed this. According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, the Yokosuka authorities announced on the 13th that nineteen airmen who had gone missing in the Shanghai area on August 21st had been confirmed dead in action. They included Aviation Chief Petty Officer Yuichi Kawaguchi, Yaichiro Oba, Kyuichi Sato, Masaichi Akahori, Petty Officer 1st Class Shotaro Kawada, Teppei Takahashi, Sakuro Nakajima, Petty Officer 2nd Class Kohei Ishijima, Keiji Ueki, Shizue Horigoshi, Kazutake Obara, Petty Officer 3rd Class Shinji Ono, Takeo Iwata, Maintenance Chief Petty Officer Tsutau Masuyama, Maintenance Petty Officer 1st Class Shige Kameta, Sueo Tobata, Kozo Suzuki, Maintenance Petty Officer 2nd Class Masatake Tokito, and Kosuke Uchida.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Launches Another Sneak Attack on Chunjiang Wharf</h3>
<p>They were repelled by our forces. Enemy warships fear our night attacks and open fire.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 5:00 PM, there was a fierce artillery battle in the Pudong area. Enemy warships in the Huangpu River fired on Pudong, and our artillery immediately returned fire, ceasing after about an hour. The enemy positions in the Yangshupu area were hit many times, resulting in significant losses. Over ten shells landed around the Tianzhang Paper Mill in Pudong, but caused no damage to us because they landed in open areas. There were occasional small skirmishes at night. Enemy small boats patrolled the area for surveillance and fired machine guns at Chunjiang Wharf, etc., but were repelled by our forces. Around midnight, enemy warships heard a certain noise and, suspecting a night attack by our air force, opened fire with machine guns and anti-aircraft guns for about ten minutes until they realized there was nothing there. This shows that the enemy forces fear the power of our air force. According to Dagongshe, the enemy forces have been very aggressive in their attempts to attack our Pudong positions in recent days. Because their attacks have been unsuccessful, they resort to base behavior every evening late at night, using a gangland tactic, with multiple speedboats carrying four or five people each, equipped with machine guns and surveying equipment to carry out secret operations along the Pudong wharves. After completing their operations, they leave a secret mark at the location so that the enemy forces can land there in the future and to indicate the amount of troops to deploy. Many foreigners have witnessed this operation and express their deep contempt for their shameless actions.</p>
<h3>Nearly 10,000 Enemy Reinforcements Landed</h3>
<p>Part of them landed at various points along the river. A division and a brigade are preparing for a general offensive.</p>
<p>Today (the 24th) at 8:15 AM, another group of enemy reinforcements, about a thousand people, arrived in Shanghai on the No. 38 transport ship, the Koan Maru, a converted enemy merchant ship, and docked at the Osaka Wharf. These reinforcements landed immediately. In total, nearly 10,000 enemy reinforcements have landed at various wharves in the Hudong district of Shanghai in the past three days. The total number of enemy reinforcements this time is said to be approximately 40,000, including one division and one brigade, and some have also landed at various points along the river.</p>
<h3>The Enemy is Recruiting Conscripts from Korea and Taiwan</h3>
<p>To avoid extreme panic among the domestic population, the enemy is prioritizing the recruitment of conscripts from Korea and Taiwan. The enemy's exhaustion of plans and strength is further highlighted by this.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the enemy has suffered heavy losses in Shanghai and has repeatedly requested reinforcements, but to no avail. Recently, they have been bombing our interior on a large scale, while also planning another large-scale reinforcement in an attempt to make a last-ditch effort. However, to avoid causing extreme panic among the domestic population, the enemy military authorities will prioritize the recruitment of conscripts from Korea and Taiwan, about two divisions, and transport them to Shanghai to serve as shock troops on the front lines. The enemy's exhaustion of plans and strength, as well as the wickedness of their intentions, can be clearly understood from the above information.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warship Cannons are Being Transported Ashore</h3>
<p>Since our troops have secured the first line of defense, enemy naval artillery fire has become ineffective. The enemy forces have not only been transporting large quantities of military supplies from their country for several days, but they have also been dismantling cannons from enemy warships and transporting them ashore at the Yunzaobang and Qiujiang wharves, etc., for transfer to the front lines to set up artillery positions.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Army's Tragic Encounter in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Fearing our air raids, they dare not light lamps at night.</p>
<p>For days, the enemy forces have feared night raids by our air force. From 7:00 PM onwards, all enemy warships in the Huangpu River and enemy positions in the Yangshupu and Hongkou districts have not dared to light lamps. Even when the enemy's highest military commander holds important meetings, they do the same. As a result, when we look east from the Bund, the area from the Waibaidu Bridge becomes a dark, silent world, like a ghostly hell. As a result, it is difficult for the enemy forces to build defensive works or transport military supplies at this time, and they can only rely on the reflected light from the lights in the concession area south of the Suzhou Creek to grope their way, their situation is so miserable and pitiful that it cannot be described further.</p>
<h3>Enemy Air Raids on the Capital are Strategically Disadvantageous</h3>
<p>Gains and losses in terms of mechanics and geography are clearly discernible. We await the enemy in a relaxed state, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<p>Our reporter interviewed a senior official from the central government who had just arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday and asked about the situation in Nanjing after the enemy planes repeatedly raided the capital in recent days. We were honored to receive a very detailed explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of the air battles between the enemy and ourselves. We have recorded it as follows:</p>
<p>Since the start of the Shanghai battle, it has been more than forty days. Thanks to the bloody resistance of our loyal and brave soldiers at the front and the unity of our government and people in the rear, the stubborn enemy has been at a loss, unable to advance or retreat, and their dream of a swift victory has become an illusion. They have had no choice but to resort to beastly behavior and threaten our capital with their air force in the hope of forcing our country to submit to them. Recently, they have become even more brazen, disregarding international law, and have even used the despicable tactic of threatening foreign envoys stationed in Nanjing to leave our capital. However, not only have the countries not been moved by this, but they have also separately raised criticisms and protests with the Japanese government, demonstrating that justice resides in the hearts of the people and that the principles of law have not been extinguished. As for the results of the enemy planes' repeated attacks on Nanjing, let us put aside the material losses for the moment and simply explain the principles of mechanics and the advantages and disadvantages of geography to easily understand the benefits and losses of both sides. The enemy's air force bases, not to mention those as far away as Taipei, even if they take off from the land east of Shanghai, require at least an hour to fly to Nanjing in the shortest time. However, once enemy planes take off, everything on board is completely trapped in an extremely unfortunate situation. After the enemy planes take off, they cannot land halfway until their mission is completed and they safely return to their base. The only exception is if they are shot down by our forces. Other situations, such as if the plane suffers heavy damage, the flight time has expired, or the gasoline has run out, forcing them to land, at the very least, all the airmen on board will immediately become prisoners, and the plane itself will become our war trophy. For this reason, after the enemy's air force personnel take off, a sense of emptiness, panic, and fear fills their hearts. Furthermore, the main purpose of the enemy planes attacking our capital is bombing, so they must use a large number of heavy bombers loaded with extremely heavy bombs, and use half the number of fighters as escorts. However, because of its own weight, the bomber's movements become unusually cumbersome. Once they fly to the airspace above the destination, they are met by our air force and air defense units, and the enemy planes are immediately panicked and lose contact. The fighter escorts are eager to empty their machine guns in an attempt to shirk responsibility, and the bombers are even more eager to drop their bombs and flee for their lives. As for the risk of being intercepted by our forces at any time and anywhere along the way, that is another matter. On the other hand, everything is the opposite for our air force. Not only can we take off and land freely at any time and anywhere, but we can also await the enemy in a relaxed state, attacking the enemy's weakness with our strength. Furthermore, those who greet the enemy are all fighters and destroyers, which are light, fast, and nimble, and have no concerns about flight time. This is a factual analysis from the perspective of mechanics and geography. There is no doubt about it. Although the enemy planes have repeatedly carried out their atrocities, and the enemy planes have bombed almost all the important cities along our country's coast and inland, the results they have achieved have not only failed to make us submit in the slightest, but have also increased the indignation of our people and strengthened our determination to resist to the end.</p>
<h3>Intense Artillery Battles on the Jinpu Railway Front</h3>
<p>As a result, our army had the upper hand. Enemy planes bomb Cangzhou Station.</p>
<p>[Jinan] This morning, the artillery battle in the front was very fierce, and we had the upper hand. Four enemy planes flew to Cangzhou Station, east of the city gate, and dropped seven or eight bombs. Another five planes flew from Cangzhou to Zhuanhe and then back to Cangzhou to bomb. Thirty-six enemy planes bombed Yunyun Port yesterday, attempting to cover the landing, but were repelled. (Urgent telegram, 11:00 AM on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Invoking the Nine-Power Treaty to Handle the Sino-Japanese Conflict</h3>
<p>The U.S. Government will carefully study any suggestions made by the signatory countries.</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement saying that there have been no new developments in the Far East situation since yesterday, and that there is nothing to say at this time about whether the Pact of Paris or the Washington Nine-Power Treaty can be implemented. In addition, a State Department official stated that the government has not received any information about the plan to invoke the Nine-Power Treaty to handle the current dispute between China and Japan, other than seeing news about it in the newspapers. Semi-official sources say that if the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, the Pact of Paris, or other countries make any suggestions, the U.S. Government will carefully study them. According to the current U.S. foreign policy, it is based on the written statement issued by Secretary of State Hull on July 16, and according to the statement issued by Hull on August 23, the various principles contained in the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Pact of Paris have already been included in the July 16 written statement. (Central News Agency, Havas Radio, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Washington] It is reported that the United States and other leading countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, have exchanged information in the past few days regarding the various actions they have taken regarding the Sino-Japanese conflict. However, no signatory country has yet indicated that it intends to formally invoke this treaty, as there are many difficulties with this move. The reasons for the difficulties are: ㊀ The treaty does not provide for the establishment of a mechanism for implementing the decisions of signatory country meetings. ㊁ When a meeting is convened, Japan will almost certainly refuse to participate, which will further complicate the situation. ㊂ The opinions of the signatory countries are very different, and it is almost impossible to establish an agreement on a specific action. According to well-informed sources, the signatory countries must first undergo some preliminary preparation work to establish a united front before a meeting can be convened, otherwise, holding a meeting hastily may not yield good results. It is said that the U.S. authorities are determined to avoid falling into a diplomatic predicament like that encountered by Secretary of State Stimson in 1932.

<h3>London Citizens Demonstrate in Front of Japanese Ambassador's Residence</h3>
<p>[London] Tonight, 200 London men and women marched to the square near the residence of the Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Kichita. Afterwards, they gathered in front of the Yoshida residence and shouted, "Get the Japanese murderers out of China!" and "Recall your bombers!" The situation was tense for a while.</p>
<h3>Brief Commentary</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>I have two things. To inform the Japanese people. First. According to a Tokyo dispatch, the use of force against China has greatly affected foreign trade. In August, imports exceeded exports by 47 million yuan. Shipping losses on all routes were huge. Domestic and foreign businesses have all come to a standstill. If the war is prolonged, a third increase in the budget will be inevitable, and those who directly bear the burden are the general public who do not want war. Second. The Japanese warlords have been losing the war and are extremely bored, and specialize in bombing innocent people in our country as if it were something great. Therefore, a certain Western newspaper said that the current Japanese planes are brutally killing innocent people in our country. One day, some country will also bomb Tokyo, Osaka, and other densely populated cities. At that time, no one will mourn for them. The above two points are the painful experiences that the Japanese people have encountered in the past and will encounter in the future regarding the use of force against China. Therefore, recently, the famous Japanese lawyer Hiromi Ikimori's recent book "Admonishing Militarists" promotes anti-war ideas and has been arrested by the Metropolitan Police Department. Indeed. Under the control of these mad warlords, the Japanese people have no room to intervene. However, the Japanese people must also have a day when "a horse jumps over the wall." I hope that the rational citizens of Japan will wake up as soon as possible and avoid leaving behind regrets.</p>

<h3>Enemy Warships Patrol the Pearl River Estuary, Searching Merchant Ships, Burning Down Customs</h3>
<p>Humen is under martial law, and ships are not allowed to enter or leave at night. The British government protested the enemy's ship robbery and customs burning.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication, on the 6th of this month, enemy warships sailed into the Pearl River Estuary and Lingdingyang to bombard Chilan, which belongs to Baoan County. They then sent marines to circle Lingding Island to intercept our country's outgoing merchant ships and fishing boats for their use. On the morning of the same day, the ships that sailed from Hong Kong to Guangzhou (commonly travelling between Hong Kong and Guangzhou) Da Yi, Taishan, Xian, and Guangxi, had just passed Lingdingyang when the dawn was breaking, and the Japanese warships began their illegal act of threatening and searching the ships. Fortunately, the Tian Yi had already passed the Japanese warship and entered Humen. Taishan was following closely behind when the Japanese warship saw it approaching and immediately fired a volley, and dispatched a small boat carrying sailors to board the ship for inspection. The owner of Taishan, (the ship belongs to the British-owned Yangxing Shipping Company) refused to be inspected. While the negotiation was in progress, the Japanese warship did not attack the other ships, so Xian and Guangxi and Tian Yi were able to reach Guangzhou directly. After refusing inspection, Taishan was forced to turn back to Hong Kong for the safety of the passengers and reported to the Hong Kong government. The Hong Kong government immediately telegraphed the British warship to request protection. On the same day, the British Consul in Guangzhou, Pylant, also went to Hong Kong from Guangdong to discuss with the Hong Kong government how to protest to the Japanese government and to respond to the consultation from the Guangdong-Guangxi Diplomatic Council regarding the Japanese warships intercepting two Chinese customs patrol boats and burning down the Datong Customs. As a result, it was decided to telegraph the British capital in accordance with international law, requesting the British Foreign Office in London to telegraph the British Ambassador to Japan to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese government. The Hong Kong government received a reply on the 11th and sent it to Guangzhou stating that this serious incident had been ordered by the British capital to the British Ambassador to Japan to protest and requested to wait for a resolution. However, without concrete sanctions, Japanese warships continued to rampage on the surface of Lingdingyang, disregarding the law and engaging in arbitrary acts of violence. On the morning of the 9th, the enemy opened fire on the Cantonese-Hong Kong ship Tian Yi when it was in Wenlingdingyang. Tian Yi immediately stopped sailing. The Japanese warship then dispatched two small boats carrying sailors and crew to board the ship by force. They first asked the captain whether he was carrying military equipment or harboring Chinese politicians. The captain replied, but the Japanese officer did not believe it and ordered the sailors to search the entire ship and review all the documents belonging to the ship, searching for about three hours before leaving in frustration. After the 10th, the Hong Kong government implemented ship escort, and at the same time, Cantonese-Hong Kong ships also stopped sailing at night and changed to sailing during the day. The enemy warships harassed the ships on the sea, becoming more and more fierce. On the 9th, the enemy destroyer No. 39 bombarded and destroyed the Dachan Customs near Lingding Island. The sound of artillery fire was loud, and Humen had to announce martial law at 5 pm that afternoon. Ships were not allowed to pass through at night to prevent enemy warships from attacking at night. After Dachan Kun was occupied by the enemy, some of the Dajing Customs officials were killed, and some fled to Taipingxu near Humen, and temporarily handled customs affairs in Taiping. Foreign ships used to wait for pilots in Dachan. Since Dachan was occupied by the enemy, the Guangdong authorities officially notified the consuls of various countries that the location for foreign ships to wait for pilots in the future would be changed to anchor next to the Shancha Island Tower (ie, the Longhuo Mountain Bank). After waiting for the day, they could enter the port. At the same time, night-time preparations in Humen were even stricter. When the sailors occupied Dachan Customs on the same day, they first burned down the houses near Dachan. There were seven or eighty fishermen living in thatch huts in the area, and after being burned down, the Gan people were scattered, which was unspeakable. After the enemy sailors ravaged Dachan, they immediately returned to the warship. At present, the site of Dachan Customs has become a pile of rubble. On the 11th, six enemy warships were still cruising in Lingdingyang, and several dozen of our fishing boats were intercepted for their use. For several days, they have been constantly sending reconnaissance planes from the warships to inspect and photograph the terrain near the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, preparing for bombing. It was found that an enemy plane flew to the vicinity of Shitan Station on the 9th to inspect, and on the 11th, two more enemy planes flew to Shenzhen Station and circled for a week, then turned to Humen to secretly photograph the terrain, which was discovered by our air defense post. The air force station was immediately notified to send a plane to pursue them, but the enemy plane had already disappeared. It seems that the enemy's intention to bomb the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is very clear.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Disrupt Fujian Coastal Waters</h3>
<p>According to reports, enemy ships are seizing fishing boats and brutally killing fishermen, while enticing treacherous individuals to supply them with provisions.</p>
<p>Fuzhou dispatch: Since the enemy navy declared a blockade of our coastline, Japanese warships have been distributed along the Fujian coast, from Xiapu in eastern Fujian, passing through Lianjiang, Tuanhou, Changle, Fuqing, Pingtan, Putian, Hui'an, Jinjiang, Tong'an, and all the way to Xiamen. The total number is estimated to be over fifteen ships. Those whose hull numbers have been identified include the "Yubari," "Wakaba," and "Sanae" of the 6th Submarine Squadron; the "Asakaze," "Harukaze," "Matsukaze," and "Hatakaze" of the 5th Destroyer Squadron; and the "Kuretake" of the 13th Destroyer Squadron and the "Hayate" and "Oite" of the 29th Destroyer Squadron. These enemy ships specialize in intercepting and seizing passing cargo ships and capturing fishermen at sea, causing widespread disruption. For example, in Meihua Township, which belongs to Changle County and is located on the coast, two enemy ships are anchored in the Sanzhou Port area, 40 li from the shore. Besides seizing our merchant ships, they forcibly capture fishermen to act as guides, using small boats to transport soldiers into the port with the intention of looting. However, our local garrison has taken strict precautions, preventing the enemy from completing surveying and photography, and they returned. At night, the enemy ships still use searchlights to illuminate the area. In the Nanbeiguantang area, opposite Meihua Township, which is originally an isolated island, sailors from the enemy ships anchored at Sanzhou Port have landed several times in recent days, looting grain and rice, and detaining villagers to force their families to procure supplies, otherwise the detainees will be killed. The local residents usually rely entirely on fishing and animal husbandry for a living. Now, with enemy ships rampant at sea, they cannot fish, and the grain they have stored has been looted, leaving the residents on the verge of starvation. Seven enemy planes were spotted off the coast of Meihua, Changle, five days ago. One night, they used searchlights to illuminate the area, and two more warships, flying British and American flags, entered and anchored offshore. It is questionable whether these were actually British or American warships. Eight enemy ships anchored in the Mazu Ao waters outside the port of Minhou County are also posturing as if to attack. On the 9th, the enemy ships "Sanae" and "Wakaba" advanced and anchored near the first floating dock of the Changmen Fortress, moving from time to time, and illuminating the area with searchlights at night, making it as bright as day. Furthermore, the "Shuishunteng," a Shandong civilian ship fully loaded with tea and porcelain, was sailing from Fuzhou to Yantai on the 9th when it was discovered near Mazu Ao by the enemy ships anchored there. They immediately dispatched a speedboat, intending to seize the ship. The captain ordered the crew to arm themselves and defend the ship, firing shots. The enemy ships "Sanae" and "Wakaba" immediately surrounded the ship upon hearing the gunfire, as if facing a major enemy, and fired a dense barrage of machine gun fire. The civilian ship still showed no weakness, using all its rifles to resist, until almost all were killed or wounded before it surrendered. It was found that of the ship's twenty-one crew members, eight were killed, one escaped by swimming, and the rest were seriously wounded. The cargo was completely taken. Furthermore, in the Xiaogan area of the third district of Lianjiang County, treacherous individuals have recently been discovered secretly transporting rice and grain to supply the enemy ships anchored near Nantang. On the 4th of this month, the district's joint security director, together with the district police, arrested eight Chinese traitors involved in transporting rice to aid the enemy, as well as more than a dozen bags of rice. The words "Dai Nippon (Great Japan) Factory First Class" were written on the rice bags. They were immediately sent to the district office for handling. The district head, Li Shoujian, was slightly enticed by the enemy and released the eight traitors without punishment and allowed the rice to be transported. Also, the military and police authorities of the provincial capital dispatched detectives to the Xiaocheng area on the 5th and arrested four Chinese traitors transporting rice to aid the enemy and detained them at the third district police station. District head Li Shoujian also released them without authorization, which infuriated the residents. Furthermore, several days ago, four Lianjiang merchants, including Zheng, secretly transported 183 bags of white rice (70 jin per bag) via Chang'an, at the border between Lianjiang and Wenhou, attempting to cross the river and go out to sea. Xie, the district head of the first district of Guantou, learned of this and sent police to intercept them, arresting the traitors and escorting them back to Guantou and transferring them to the Lianjiang County government for strict handling. The provincial authorities have now issued a notice to the governments of all counties along the coast, instructing them to educate and prohibit ignorant and foolish people from being incited and lured by profit to sell grain privately to the enemy. They are also instructed to conduct strict investigations and arrests, and those who are discovered will be severely punished according to the law without leniency, and to prohibit ships from leaving port privately, in order to avoid disaster. It has been found that the seventeen coastal counties of the province are all rich and populous areas, with a high population density, accounting for nearly half of the entire province. They were originally the economic lifeline of the province. The number of fishermen in each county is also high. According to statistics from interim agencies, there are approximately 118,000 fishing families working at sea, with an average of five people per family, totaling over 600,000 people. With the port blockade, making a living is difficult, and the suffering is pitiful. It is hoped that the authorities will quickly formulate relief measures to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Commodity Prices Plunge in Nantong</h3>
<p>New cotton sells for 14 yuan per dan (unit of weight). Nantong implements martial law to prevent treason.</p>
<p>Nantong Dispatch: This year's new cotton harvest in Nantong is bountiful, but due to the Shanghai war, factories have suspended operations and only a few cotton exchanges have opened, leading to a decline in cotton prices. Seed cotton is only selling for 14 yuan per dan, and cotton farmers are unwilling to sell. Currently, river transport is limited to sandboats, small river ferries, and highway buses, which are still operating as usual. The native products of various counties north of the Yangtze River were previously marketed in Shanghai, but now they are flooding the local market, causing prices to plummet. Pork, chicken, duck, and other products are selling particularly cheaply. Nantong is close to Songhu (Shanghai), and traitors and petty criminals are secretly active. The local authorities have arrested many. Chang Enduo, the Nantong Garrison Commander, has implemented martial law from 10 PM to 5 AM each night for security reasons to guard against enemy aircraft reconnaissance. He has also exhorted merchants and civilians with six points: 1. Merchants and civilians should maintain their livelihoods. 2. Construct air raid shelters. 3. Report traitors. 4. Strictly prohibit spreading rumors. 5. Do not raise prices. 6. Arrest swindlers. The area has been peaceful recently. The garrison is strictly guarding the coast to prevent enemy ship invasions.</p>
<p>Schools in the city are temporarily closed due to the current situation, but schools in rural areas have resumed classes. Local newspapers are jointly publishing special editions in the morning and evening due to the disruption of paper supply. More than 8,000 Shanghai refugees have been transported to Nantong by river steamers and sandboats and are being housed in shelters.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Journalists' Association Allocates Funds to Purchase Public Bonds</h3>

<h3>High Tide in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Over the past week, the tides in Shanghai have been very high, especially yesterday. Around 3 PM, the water flooded the low-lying areas east, west, south of the Tatung Road Bridge (commonly known as Suzhou Creek), on Guangfu Road, and on both banks of the east end of the Wuzhen Road Bridge. The water in the sewers in the lower-lying areas next to the North Sichuan Road, North Jiangxi Road, and the New Customs Wharf in the International Settlement also flowed backwards onto the land, but it receded quickly.</p>
<h3>Resistance Association Continues Registration of Specialized Personnel</h3>
<p>▲Registration office located on Yu Qiaqing Road</p>
<p>The Design Committee of the Shanghai All-Circles Resistance Support Association, in order to meet the needs of the long-term war of resistance, is conducting a registration of specialized personnel and has established a temporary registration office at No. 4, Lane 587, Yu Qiaqing Road. For several days, people with special skills have been actively registering. The Association has now decided to continue this registration. Anyone with specialized skills who is prepared to serve the country and has not registered with other organizations in the city can go to the Association's temporary registration office to obtain a form and register. The registration time is from 9 AM to 12 PM every day.</p>
<h3>New British Consul General Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The new British Consul General in Shanghai, Philip, arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru No. 9. He is expected to arrive in port this morning. Since the former Consul General, Sir John Brenan, stepped down, the duties of the Shanghai consulate have been handled by Davison. After Philip assumes office, Davison will soon take a leave and return to the United Kingdom for training.</p>
<h3>American Warship Carrying Overseas Chinese Home</h3>
<p>The American transport ship "Chaumont" left Shanghai for Qingdao on the morning of the 22nd. It will load American overseas Chinese from Qingdao and Yantai and return to Shanghai this month, then load American overseas Chinese from Shanghai and sail to Manila via Hong Kong before proceeding to the United States. The American transport ship "Gold Star" is also sailing from the United States to Shanghai via Kobe, Qingdao, and Yantai, and is expected to arrive at the Woosung estuary on the 28th. It is reported that the ship will load a second group of American overseas Chinese and sail directly to Manila on the same day.</p>
<h3>Pharmaceutical Industry Actively Donates Medicine Packages</h3>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Industry Federation urgently convened a meeting of the board of directors yesterday because frontline soldiers need emergency medicine packages. The Sino-French Pharmacy, China-America Pharmacy, Sino-Western Pharmacy, New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, Jihua Tang Pharmacy, and Five Continents Pharmacy each donated 20,000 packages. Sino-British Pharmacy and Aifei Pharmaceutical Society each donated 10,000 packages. Nanyang Pharmacy and China-Foreign Pharmacy each donated 5,000 packages. Xinhua Pharmacy and Jicheng Pharmacy each donated 2,000 packages. The remaining pharmacies that did not attend will be contacted.</p>
<h3>Refugees from Baoshan, Jiading, and Taicang Lack Warm Clothing</h3>
<p>Urgent appeal for assistance from all sectors</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the three counties of Baoshan, Jiading, and Taicang have been severely affected. The number of refugees from these three counties has reached over 600,000. Some have fled to neighboring counties such as Qingpu, Zhujia, Penglai, and west of Fangtai, while the rest have been rescued by the Taicang Jiading Baoshan Refugee Relief Association and housed in various shelters in the concessions. However, because the refugees fled in their bare bodies, and those who were able to bring clothes only had summer clothing, they are now facing the autumn cold. The disaster situation in the three counties is extremely serious, making relief efforts difficult. As a result, the number of people falling ill and dying is increasing daily. The Association is appealing to kind people from all walks of life to provide generous assistance to save those who are dying. Old cotton clothing and bedding can be sent to the Association's office at Room 103, 1st floor, 11 Gongguan Ma Road, French Concession. The Association has been receiving donations from the Wartime Service Corps of the Education Industry, the Joint Association of Western Manufacturers, Yunfei Automobile, Gui Bian, Xiangwen Zhang, Yucang Chen, Bingnan Wang, Liankui Yao, and Rilou Huang, which the Association has been distributing to the refugees.</p>
<h3>Swire and Jardine Add Ships to Coastal Routes</h3>
<p>Including the Guangdong, Zesheng, and other freighters</p>
<p>All coastal freighters owned by Chinese shipping companies have suspended service since the outbreak of the war. However, freighters owned by the British companies Swire and Jardine are still operating as usual. One route runs from Shanghai to Xiamen, Shantou, Chaozhou, and Guangzhou, and the other runs from Shanghai to Qingdao, Yantai, Weihai, and Tianjin. Initially, due to reduced cargo at each port, only a few ships were assigned to barely maintain the routes. Now that cargo and passengers have increased at each port, such as Tianjin's fruit and Guangdong's sugar cane, more ships like the Guangdong, Hubei, Fusheng, and Zesheng have been added to these routes.</p>
<h3>Relief Society Buries Floating Corpses in Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war over a month ago, the number of innocent civilians who have died as a result of the war is very high. Especially in the Zhabei Suzhou Creek area, corpses of unidentified men and women are everywhere. When the tide rises, the corpses float with the rapid current, making it difficult to retrieve them. After the tide recedes, the corpses are swollen and rotten, posing a significant health hazard. The Municipal Relief Society has instructed the Zhabei Charity Corps and the Red Cross to be responsible for burying the corpses. Since September 8, they have collected and buried no less than twenty corpses. Except for two soldiers, the rest are unidentified and their faces are unrecognizable, a truly tragic sight.</p>

<h3>Organization and Cooperation in Local Relief Work</h3>
<p>— Huang Yiqing</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 1st Shanghai War, I went with a Red Cross rescue team to prepare and establish a temporary hospital. During discussions, I learned that local people were very willing to cooperate with local authorities, but they could not feel at ease with the government's "control" of wartime relief. After returning to Shanghai, I met with a leader of a charity and was happy to hear that a relief hospital had been established in that area as well, however, they clearly didn't agree with the government controlling the rescue work.</p>
<p>The term "control" is said to have originated from an order from a certain provincial Civil Affairs Department. I have not seen the order, but I assume the intention of the order was to prevent corruption. According to the central relief plan and the organizational methods of the provincial and municipal relief committees, each province and city should set up a relief committee in the provincial and municipal government seats, organized by (1) medical and pharmaceutical organizations and medical education institutions, (2) chambers of commerce, (3) the Chinese Red Cross, and (4) other organizations related to the rescue work. Local party headquarters, government, and health authorities would send people to guide and participate. The relief committee should be mainly composed of local organizations, with party and government organs in a guidance and participation position. All actual relief work should be carried out by people's organizations, who would bravely shoulder their responsibilities and cooperate in the construction and take actual responsibility. When the provincial government transfers the order to the county government, and the county government establishes a county relief committee, they cannot stray outside of this scope.</p>
<p>Now, total resistance is underway, and the situation is becoming urgent. If there is even a slight bit of formality and politeness between local officials and the people, and only a nominal cooperation, and if the local authorities are exercising the so-called "control," with empty plans and aloofness, it will be difficult to obtain the assistance of the people. If powerful local organizations are being passive and watching from the sidelines, taking the efforts of the government as their own, then there will be little economic cooperation, and the rise and fall of relief organizations will be left to fate. Eventually, the people will have nothing to do with relief work, and will be unable to accept control. The government's control over local relief will also be intangible and ineffective. Thinking of this, I cannot imagine the future of rescue and relief.</p>
<p>In my opinion, everyone needs to face the facts. First, people need to realize that corruption cannot be prevented if some form of control is not exercised. Second, they must realize that besides preventing corruption, control has no other positive function. In other words, local legal organizations and the local relief committee should be responsible for raising funds and carrying out relief work. At the same time, the government should also provide guidance and support, but should not hinder them. Third, they should recognize that this is a patriotic undertaking, and there is no need to engage in formalities and nominal consultations. Since we are all concerned citizens, we should all do our part. We should not distinguish between ourselves and others, let alone between officials and civilians, and we should all rush to do it. In this way, the personnel, medicines, equipment, and supplies needed for relief in various places will be readily available and continuously supplied, and the relief work in various places during the full-scale war of resistance can be fully deployed and sustained.</p>
