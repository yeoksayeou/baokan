<h3>血肉相搏有進無退我軍又佔領敵海軍操塲</h3>
<p>敵軍先後失卻聯絡形勢孤立　新築之根據地亦被我軍包圍　浦東前夜大戰敵受重大損害</p>
<p>侵滬日軍、既迭次失利、節節潰退、復經前昨兩日晚、被我各路陸空軍予以痛擊後、已實行放棄其前後三軍事重要根據地、雖援軍頻增、終以勢陷窮蹙、勞而無功、尤以敵主艦出雲號、被我一炸、悄然移防、從事修理、可見敵膽已寒、途窮日暮、惟敵以大軍雲集、不得不亟亟企圖在浦東登陸、然經前晚血戰結果、喪亡過半、鍛羽而退、到下東區敵軍及江灣路司令部、已受我層層包圍、雖該司令部內殘部尚希憑其堅固之工事、據地死守、但亦不難一鼓掃蕩、頑敵崩潰僅時日問題耳、</p>
<p>東區我軍各路大捷</p>
<p>我軍佔領海軍操塲</p>
<p>日軍自在此兩日間、先後放棄其滬東公大第一紗廠、及竇樂安路日海軍司令部兩軍事重要根據地後、其所賴以掙扎者、僅一在虹鎮以南范家宅附近之日海軍操塲而已、且不時掩護共兩翼、向我引翔港及江灣地帶進犯、我軍因於昨晨七時許大畢痛剿、完全以血肉相搏、敵軍不支、節節潰退、我軍乘勝追擊、於淸晨八時三十分、完全佔頒敵軍之僅有根據地、又增添滬戰史中光榮之一頁、此役我方稍有損失、而敵軍創傷尤為巨大、敵之海陸軍聯絡、已為我軍所控制、</p>
<p>中央社云、軍息、昨晨被我軍佔領之敵海軍操塲、為軍事衝要之區、自敵放棄公大紗廠及北四川路底兩司令部後、海軍操塲即成全軍中樞、且可掩護兩翼、被找佔領後、敵軍已失重心、此次我軍進攻、以血肉相搏、頗有損失、敵軍拼死低禦、創傷尤巨、</p>
<p>敵新根據地受包圍</p>
<p>確息、敵軍放棄公大紗廠、卽潰退定海路騰越路一帶、並在裕豐·大康·兩紗廠、及美人所辦之水電廠、新築根據地、昨晨我軍乘勝分兩路進搏、敵已狠狽潰敗、尚有一部、仍在發電廠頑抗、已被我軍包圍不難解決、中央社去、楊樹浦敵軍山公大紗廠潰敗後、以裕豐紗廠與大康紗廠間之發電廠為新根據地、我左翼軍、昨日沿浦江乘勝推進、下午二時許、已將該廠包圍、頑抗殘敵、卽叮殲滅、</p>
<p>滬東華界已無敵跦</p>
<p>敵自退出裕豐大康兩紗廠、在美人所辦之發電廠附近、圍作新根據地後、我軍仍乘勝追擊、敵軍喘息甫定、不敢回抗、遂向西南方面租界區域潰退、我軍東區前綫、已於今晨二時五十分、到達楊樹浦橋、故該區華界方面已無敵蹤、同時木館接得𡩋國路方面報告、據稱在今晨二時許、曾見我軍經過𡩋國路地帶、向敵迫擊、</p>
<p>各路進展捷報頻傳</p>
<p>（中央社）滬戰爆發後、我軍卽採大包圍陣勢、向敵左右兩翼猛烈進攻、日兵在楊樹浦方面、已退至裕豐紗廠後發電廠、收拾殘部、搆築新防錢、北四川路方而，我攻克虹口公園後、敵陸戰隊司令部已被包圍、孤軍困守、憑其軍房、在頑抗中、正面陣綫、則以虹鎮以南、范家宅左近之海軍操塲為主要陣地、頻向我江灣方面進襲、均被我軍擊退、昨夜敵以軍艦重砲為掩護、尚圍反攻、以挽回危局、但迄未得手、今晨據前綫報告、我軍於拂曉、在正面猛力衝鋒、肉搏數次、敵終不支、已於八時半退至岳州路以南、敵全綫已均退入租界區域內、</p>
<p>（中央社）十六日下午六時起之猛烈砲戰、至十七日晨二時始稍停、五時重砲及機關槍聲、又轟然大作、至九時許停止、據報、殘敗敵軍、圍恢復所失陣地、各路向我反攻、我忠勇將士、沉着應戰、堅守陣地、未為所動、各路敵軍、俱受重創潰退、我軍乘勝追擊、中路尤奮勇挺進、於八時半佔領范家宅左近之海軍操場、敵已全部退入租界、現我中路與左右兩翼、已連成一綫、北四川路底敵司令部與敵後部、已失却聯絡、成孤立形勢、我軍各路、正相機推進、一二日内、可望有一重大結果、</p>
<p>我三度佔領俱樂部</p>
<p>（中央社）北四川路底之日本海軍俱樂部、為敵軍數要根據地之一、曾於十五日被我軍佔頷、旋又退出、十六日再度佔領、旋父再度退出、咋晨八時許、我□□師□□團、繼續進攻、在敵軍密集彈雨之下、浴血前進、三度佔領該俱樂部、敵軍死傷甚衆、我軍刻正一面乘勝追擊、一面構築陣地中、</p>
<p>敵軍陣地愈縮愈小</p>
<p>北四川路底之敵司令部與後部之聯絡、受我軍嚴重之威脅、現我軍全綫、已將全部敵軍陣地、愈縮愈小、完成大包圍之勢、冉者因我軍前綫挺進、敵軍大砲、已全失威力、故最近兩日來之戰事、已不若最初兩日之常聞隆然砲聲、蓋已進為前哨戰、僅敵艦與我砲兵偶爾互相還盤而已、惟敵艦胞火、不若大砲之兇猛、故我軍損失極小、預料如無其他變化、短期內當可將全部敵軍解決、昨日我司令官張治中、曾親赴前綫指揮督戰、士氣為之大振、</p>
<p>敵海軍武官室中彈</p>
<p>昨晨五時起、我軍以重砲轟擊虹口方面之敵軍、砲火密集、標的準確、至上午八時許、敵方之海軍武官室及日本小學、先後被我重砲擊中着火、燃燒甚烈、敵軍紛亂異常幾不成軍、</p>
<p>敵軍有放棄虹口勢</p>
<p>中央社據探報、本埠東漢璧禮路·東有恒路·一帶衝要區域以及件宅等敵軍、於十七日深夜趕埋地雷、似有放棄虹口模樣、</p>
<p>浦東前夜鏖戰詳紀</p>
<p>浦東方面自前晚敵艦與我該地駐軍、互相跑轟之後、日軍顯然另有重要企圍、致浦東形勢突緊、昨日上午十時、雙方又砲戰甚烈、十一時半、敵機七架、向我浦東防地肆行轟炸、頗受相當損失、但我軍毫不為動、本報記者昨午親往浦東調查、茲分誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>新馬路已變成戰場</p>
<p>至前晚十時半、雙方機槍及砲聲又起、且益密、雙方在東昌路新為路一帶接觸、各以大砲掩護前進、戰事異常戲烈、我軍奮勇殺敵、當將敵軍擊退、敵軍突圍四次、俱未得出、終被迫退歸三井煤棧、是役因雙方砲戰劇烈、吳家應廟已悉被轟燬、十五間及十八間等地方、尤為雙方砲火之焦點、沿新馬路一帶、已變成戰塲、我軍前進、將敵包圍、然因該區障礙甚多、敵軍據高臨下、防禦鞏固、一時不易將共解决、</p>
<p>日兵登岸被我擊退</p>
<p>日軍圖謀在浦東方而、有所活動、其陸戰隊約計四五百名、前晚七時許、在敵艦飽火掩謢之下、自其昌棧登陸、以三井煤棧及日華紗廠為根據地、當經我駐軍得悉、卽向前推進、决計加以驅逐、於是雙方立起激戰、我方一面予三井棧及日華紗廠以猛擊、一面以機關槍向渡浦登陸日兵掃射、當時敵軍進退不得、挾槍隋浦淹斃者無數、遭我擊落者、不知凡幾、激戰二小時、敵終不得逞、傷亡甚衆、我方傷十餘人、惟沿岸如浦東洋涇方面、曾因日艦亂放無的之砲、致稍受損害、</p>
<p>日商廠棧均遭彈擊</p>
<p>昨晨十時起、雙方又起砲戰、我砲隊當向浦江敵艦還擊、隔坏對轟、我一砲彈、射中匯山碼頭、浦東方面、日華紗廠·三井煤棧·等、亦中彈被炸、冰廠田、亦被彈中、</p>
<p>敵軍近千解决過半</p>
<p>據軍事機關消息、前晚有敵軍五百餘、便衣隊約兩百左右、在敵軍艦隊大砲掩謢之下、由新并碼頭（卽公共租界自來水公司對岸）登陸、當被我駐軍包抄圍攻、激戰數小時、結果被我解决過半、其餘一小部、則狠狈退去、又浦東其昌碼頭方面、前晚亦有敵軍數面名登岸、企圖佔領浦東新陣地、當被我軍擊敗後、尚有一百餘名、扔在該處棧房內頑強抵抗、正在包圍中、</p>
<p>中央社云、昨晨三時許、曾有敵軍陸戰五百餘名、在砲火俺護之下、白浦東三井碼頭登岸、以機關槍及小鋼砲、向我猛烈射擊、我軍奮勇應戰、卒將敵軍擊漬、倉皇登艦、向楊樹浦方面逃逸、</p>
<h3>敵飛機轟炸我軍陣地</h3>
<p>一機被我擊中墮地焚燬　我飛機一架亦中彈受傷</p>
<p>昨晨暗雲蔽空、細雨濛濛、復為空軍活動之機會、十一時以前我國飛機、除連續沿浦江偵察敵艦敵軍動作外、至十一時一刻、我空軍轟炸機兩架、復飛行浦江一帶、向敵艦施行轟炸、衣外白渡橋天空、與兩敵機發生遭遇戰、殊為激烈、一時機槍聲密如聯珠、敵艦高射砲亂嗚、經六七分鐘戰門、我機始分途向西北飛去、十一時四十五分我空軍大隊復出現上空、以最高速率、捷飛楊樹浦一帶敵軍投彈、敵陣地頗受損失、嗣後敵驅逐機兩架、不時在浦江上空、飛行巡察、至下午三時、敵機二十餘架、分隊飛北車站及麥根路站一帶轟炸、我空軍亦出而應戰、各敵機乃忽忽投彈後、卽行飛逃云、</p>
<p>轟炸敵艦我機受傷</p>
<p>昨日我空軍繼續出動、上午十時半、我飛機二架、飛至浦江天空、轟炸敵旗艦出雲號、敵方於驚惶中、高射砲及高射機槍向空際亂發、我機高冲雲霄、盤旋數匝西去、十一時許、我空軍再度出動、飛行極低、在楊樹浦一帶、用機槍掃射、敵方之高射砲高射機槍齊發、空際烟霧彌漫、不幸我機一架、機件受損、尾部着火、被追降落、共他各機、仍安然飛返、我軍再接再厲、下午二時許又飛來偵察云、</p>
<p>大批敵機轟炸閘北</p>
<p>昨日下午二時許、敵先以水上飛機三架飛往我閘北方面偵查、我軍高射砲與機槍齊發、敵機約歷十餘分鐘、卽鑽入雲層逸去、詎未及半小時之久、敵陸上雙冀戰鬥機與聶炸機、自北面分五小緣飛來、每隊三架共十五架、飛度極高、待抵閘北上空時、突然散開、同時敵以戰鬥機九架高飛為掩護、以轟作機六架向我陣地輪流不斷轟炸、當時各機所採戰術、卽六機先在敵之陣地高空飛成一圓形、待飛抵東面時、卽突轉向西急降、投彈後、我以高速度向北再枓向東、適成一半圓形、如是循環不巳，輸流投彈、半小時後、又增八架、直至四時三于分、敵機始仍向北面飛表、測其往返飛航方面、必係來自口外航空母艦、而該方面並無敵之機塲根據地也、惟事後祀者從各方面瞪實、敵此次雖整隊來炸、但我方搬失極微、因敵機投彈時飛度過高、故頗難中的、</p>
<p>浦東等處損失頗重</p>
<p>昨晨十一時三十分、敵機七架、在浦江上空出現、初在我浦東陣地、盤旋偵察後、開始投彈威脅、雖彈如雨下、我軍毫不為動、沉着應戰、達一小時之久經我軍以高射砲轟擊後、敵機遂倉皇四散、敵機投彈、大半落於東昌路以北爛泥渡陸家嘴以及鴻生碼頭等處、損失甚重、（又訊）敵軍為挽回殘局、得新到部隊援助、正布置新陣地、惟恐我軍進襲、故於昨午四時派陸上轟炸機多架、分成三隊、由浦江外高飛而來、先在閘北引翔一帶來回盤旋後、卽分散四飛、施行轟炸、投彈多枚、一時巨聲如雷、黑烟冲天、旋在東北方面、突然起火、焰姻甚熾、時以東風勁厲、故火勢西延、約二十分鐘始行梢熄、</p>
<p>敵機一架中彈焚燬</p>
<p>昨日下午四時左右、閘北發現大批日本飛機、約二十餘架、高翔天空、在各處投彈約五十枚、但多數未炸、故我並無重大損失、上午十時許、亦有敵飛機三架、初由滬內方面轉向閘北、為我駐防部隊覺察、當卽用高射砲轟擊、一機中彈橫側、擊落形似瓦片大小之鋼板一塊、厚約四五分、重四五斤、落於公共租界新閘路梅白格路口大順公南貨店門口、當時傍邊有印捕二人、頗為危險、後為該店拾得、察悉是項鋼板係該機引擊上擊落、一端有螺旋紋、故知其必受重傷、目下上項鋼板、巳由該店收藏矣、（又訊）昨日下午四時許、敵飛機八架、結隊飛往閘北虹口方面我軍陣地偵察、並投彈轟炸、企圖破壞我後方、找軍候敵機逼近時、卽齊發高射砲及高射機關搶、向空中掃射、當時激戰甚烈、其中有雙翼轟炸敵機一架、適被我高射機關愉擊中、機身受損、立卽負偽而逃、詎飛至楊樹浦定海橋對江、慶𡩋寺附近美孚火油棧方面、該機卽已失去駕駛能力、從本墮至火油池畔、轟然一聲、全機卽告燬損、駕駛機員一名、及日軍士一名、立時斃命、惟火油池未遭其殃、尚屬幸事、共他敵機四架、嗣亦無心戀戰、均匆匆遁歸、是役毀損敝機一架、死軍士二名、敵投彈十餘枚、毀我民房數間、並無其他損失云、</p>
<h3>我炮火壓迫之下出雲艦負傷移防</h3>
<p>尾部受重傷失去戰鬥力　現泊在公和祥碼頭修理</p>
<p>日本駐滬第三艦隊主艦出雲、停泊外白渡橋堍、利用租界、為發號施令、攻擊我軍之總指揮機關、我方為避免波累租界、以致空軍不能盡量施展威力、將其毀滅、由是不得不改取妥善之策、予該艦以重懲、十六日晚九時許、於雙方重砲聲中、我方即以某項爆炸軍器矗炸該艦、當即命中尾部、受損甚重、已失戰鬥力、該艦乃悄然移防、停泊下游公和祥碼頭江心、各情已誌昨日本報、昨日晨、本報記者往晨光曦微中、又驅車往該地視察、果見原泊處已另停巡洋艦一艘、而該艦則於公和祥碼頭江中停泊修理中、此舉對於租界安全問題、當可減少危險、惟仍須視該艦此後之行動如何耳、因將昨日詳細情形、彙誌於後、</p>
<p>尾部受傷從事修理</p>
<p>停泊日本郵船會社碼頭日領事館前之日旗艦出雲、前晚經我方加以猛烈轟擊後、尾部受傷、已於昨晨五時許駛離白渡橋頭、移向下游數百米處、停泊公和祥碼頭前之二號浮筒江心、原有碼頭、昨晨九時、曾有自神戶開來之運輸艦一艘、卸落大批軍火後、亦卽離去、</p>
<p>中央社云、原泊於外白政橋北面指揮敵軍作戰之敵出雲旗艦、被我轟炸機數度轟擊後、已受有損傷、十六夜又被我某項爆炸軍器將其船尾轟擊數洞、受創甚重、當卽駛離日領館、現泊於公和祥碼頭對面二號浮筒修理中、另原停泊於洋涇浜之日砲艦一艘、亦開往公和祥停泊、又有大巡洋艦一艘、則怕於招商局中棧云、</p>
<p>新新社記者昨晨赴外白渡橋邊察看、出霎艦原泊處、已改由大阪公司之貨輸停泊、遙望公和祥碼頭之敵艦出雲號、四週已有敵艦五艘停泊護衛、因該艦受傷頗重、戰鬥力消失、已不能再經我軍襲擊云、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>敬吿後方同胞</h3>
<p>— 祺</p>
<p>我國旣被侵略主義者步步進逼。不得已起而爲神聖的民族自衛戰爭。全面大戰的序幕業已揭開。我民族廢興存亡在此一舉。中樞焦勞於上鬥士苦戰於前。數年來國民所希望於政府者。一旦實現。我後方民衆。宜如何抱絕大决心。爲最後努力。竊有數事。敬吿我親愛之同胞。</p>
<p>有國家方有民族。人民所有一切財產利益。在此非常時期的關頭。均宜聽候政府來支配。不獨購買外匯。逃避資本。絕對自動停止。卽銀行存款。除充生活費及必要用途外。不宜多所提取。暫充政府軍用。舌則。國土不存。資財亦爲敵有。我國民務宜猛省。</p>
<p>前方作戰。必須士飽馬騰。才能奮勇殺敵。凡我同胞。各宜踴躍捐輸。助捐最好稅款。聽候軍事當局支配。次則爲食糧藥品。及秋冬衣服。至於無謂之犒勞。初非必要。似可停止。以節糜費。</p>
<p>後方民衆食糧。亦必須充分補充。現在輸運雖停。鐵路尚有可通。各方米源。務須設法接濟。免起民食恐慌。一方嚴禁米業居奇抬價。他如油監菜蔬燃料等。亦宜極力疏通來源。以安民心。</p>
<p>貧苦難民。情形殊堪憐憫。而於地方治安。尤可憂虛。雖已有慈善團體。設所收容。最好。一面暫時救濟。一面逐漸遣回原籍。旣可减少當地食糧。而於後方治安。尤有裨益。</p>
<p>空軍作戰。爲我国對外戰爭第一次試騐。同胞爲爱國心所驱使。拍手助威。高呼口號。本來未可厚非。但空戰非常危險。凡我同胞。如遇空中作戰時。除非必要事不必出外。過路行人。可入附近房屋暫避。以免無謂犧牲。留此有用之身。凖備最後殺敵。</p>
<p>政府决心。凖備長期抗戰。期博最後勝利。一地得失無關大局。聞勝固不必狂歡。聞敗亦不必喪氣。凡一切道聽途說之謠諑。及無綫電臺之不實報吿。均可置之不理。最後。吾尤望新聞界。於所得消息。必須設法證實。爲忠實之報吿。否則寗缺無。濫願吾同業共勉之。</p>

<h3>With Blood and Flesh, Advancing Without Retreat, Our Army Again Occupies the Enemy Naval Training Ground</h3>
<p>Enemy Forces Lose Contact Successively, Situation Isolated; Newly Built Base Surrounded by Our Army; Fierce Battle in Pudong the Night Before, Enemy Suffers Significant Damage</p>
<p>The invading Japanese army in Shanghai, having repeatedly suffered defeats and retreated steadily, was subjected to a fierce attack by our land and air forces on the evenings of the previous two days. They have now effectively abandoned their three important military bases. Although reinforcements have been frequently added, the situation is ultimately hopeless and futile. In particular, the enemy flagship Izumo was bombed by us and quietly moved away for repairs. It is evident that the enemy's courage has been shattered and their end is near. However, the enemy, with a large army gathered, is urgently attempting to land in Pudong. But after the bloody battle the night before, they suffered more than half casualties and retreated with broken wings. The enemy forces in the Lower East District and the headquarters on Jiangwan Road have been surrounded by our layers. Although the remnants in the headquarters still hope to defend their position with their solid fortifications, it will not be difficult to sweep them away in one fell swoop. The collapse of the stubborn enemy is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Victories for Our Army on All Fronts in the Eastern District</p>
<p>Our Army Occupies Naval Training Ground</p>
<p>In the past two days, the Japanese army has successively abandoned its two important military bases: the Shanghai Eastern Public University, the First Cotton Mill, and the Japanese Naval Headquarters on Doulean Road. The only thing they relied on to struggle was a Japanese naval training ground near the Fanjiatai area south of Hongzhen. They frequently covered both wings, advancing towards the Yinxianggang and Jiangwan areas. Our army launched a full-scale attack at around 7 a.m. yesterday, engaging completely in close combat with blood and flesh. The enemy forces were unable to withstand it and retreated steadily. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue and, at 8:30 a.m., completely occupied the enemy's only base, adding another glorious page to the history of the Shanghai war. Our side suffered some losses in this battle, but the enemy suffered even greater injuries. The communication between the enemy's navy and army has been controlled by our army.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy naval training ground occupied by our army yesterday morning is a strategically important area. Since the enemy abandoned the Public University Cotton Mill and the two headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road, the naval training ground has become the center of the entire army and can cover both wings. After being occupied by our army, the enemy forces have lost their center of gravity. In this offensive, our army fought with blood and flesh and suffered considerable losses. The enemy forces resisted desperately, suffering even greater injuries.</p>
<p>Enemy's New Base Surrounded</p>
<p>Reliable information reveals that after the enemy forces abandoned the Public University Cotton Mill, they retreated to the Dinghai Road and Tengyue Road area and built a new base at the Yufeng and Dakang cotton mills and the American-run water and electricity plant. Yesterday morning, our army took advantage of the victory and advanced in two routes. The enemy was defeated miserably. A portion of them is still stubbornly resisting at the power plant, but they have been surrounded by our army and it will not be difficult to resolve. According to the Central News Agency, after the Yangshupu enemy forces collapsed at the Public University Cotton Mill, they used the power plant between the Yufeng Cotton Mill and the Dakang Cotton Mill as a new base. Our left-wing army advanced along the Huangpu River, taking advantage of the victory. By about 2 p.m., they had surrounded the factory and were annihilating the stubbornly resisting remnants.</p>
<p>No Enemy Traces in the Chinese Area of Eastern Shanghai</p>
<p>After the enemy retreated from the Yufeng and Dakang cotton mills and surrounded the area near the American-run power plant to form a new base, our army continued to pursue and attack. The enemy forces, barely able to catch their breath, did not dare to resist and retreated to the concession area in the southwest direction. Our army's front line in the eastern district reached the Yangshupu Bridge at 2:50 a.m. today, so there are no enemy traces in the Chinese area of that district. At the same time, the Wooden Hall received a report from the Aiguo Road area stating that our army was seen passing through the Aiguo Road area at around 2 a.m. this morning, pressing the enemy.</p>
<p>Frequent Reports of Victory from All Fronts</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, our army immediately adopted a large encirclement formation and launched fierce attacks on the enemy's left and right wings. Japanese soldiers in the Yangshupu area have retreated to the power plant behind the Yufeng Cotton Mill, regrouping their remnants and building new defenses. On the North Sichuan Road side, after we captured Hongkou Park, the enemy Marine Corps headquarters has been surrounded, with isolated troops trapped and stubbornly resisting in their military buildings. The main position on the front line is the naval training ground near Fanjiatai, south of Hongzhen, which frequently attacks our Jiangwan area, but has been repelled by our army. Last night, the enemy used warships and heavy artillery to cover their counter-offensive in an attempt to salvage the critical situation, but they did not succeed. According to reports from the front line this morning, our army launched a fierce charge at dawn, engaging in several close-quarters combats. The enemy finally could not withstand it and retreated to the south of Yuezhou Road at 8:30 a.m. The enemy's entire line has retreated into the concession area.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) The fierce artillery battle that began at 6 p.m. on the 16th only subsided at 2 a.m. on the 17th. At 5 a.m., the sound of heavy artillery and machine guns roared again, stopping at about 9 a.m. It is reported that the defeated enemy forces are trying to recover lost ground and counter-attack us from all directions. Our loyal and brave soldiers responded calmly, firmly defending their positions, unmoved. The enemy forces on all fronts suffered heavy losses and retreated in defeat. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, with the central route advancing especially bravely, occupying the naval training ground near Fanjiatai at 8:30 a.m. The enemy has completely retreated into the concession. Now, our central route is connected with the left and right wings, and the enemy headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road has lost contact with the enemy's rear, forming an isolated situation. Our army on all fronts is advancing opportunistically, and a major result is expected within a day or two.</p>
<p>We Occupy the Club Three Times</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Japanese Naval Club at the end of North Sichuan Road is one of the enemy's key bases. It was occupied by our army on the 15th, then withdrawn. It was occupied again on the 16th, then withdrawn again. At about 8 a.m. yesterday morning, our □□ Division □□ Regiment continued to attack, advancing through a dense hail of enemy bullets, bathing in blood. They occupied the club for the third time. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. Our army is now pursuing the victory on one hand and building fortifications on the other.</p>
<p>Enemy Positions Shrink Smaller and Smaller</p>
<p>The connection between the enemy headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road and its rear is under serious threat from our army. Currently, our entire line has shrunk all enemy positions smaller and smaller, completing a large encirclement. Furthermore, because our front line has advanced, the enemy's artillery has completely lost its power. Therefore, the battles in the past two days have not been as often filled with thunderous artillery fire as the first two days. It has become a skirmish, with only enemy ships and our artillery occasionally exchanging fire. However, the enemy ships' artillery fire is not as fierce as heavy artillery, so our army's losses are minimal. It is expected that if there are no other changes, all enemy forces can be resolved in the short term. Yesterday, our commander Zhang Zhizhong personally went to the front line to direct and supervise the battle, greatly boosting morale.</p>
<p>Enemy Naval Attaché's Office Hit</p>
<p>Starting at 5 a.m. yesterday morning, our army bombarded the enemy forces in the Hongkou area with heavy artillery. The artillery fire was dense and the targets were accurate. By about 8 a.m., the enemy's naval attaché's office and the Japanese elementary school were hit by our heavy artillery and caught fire, burning fiercely. The enemy forces were extremely chaotic and almost disintegrated.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Seem to be Abandoning Hongkou</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report, the enemy forces in the important areas of Donghanbili Road and Dongyouheng Road in this city, as well as Jianzhai, etc., were hurriedly burying landmines on the night of the 17th, seemingly about to abandon Hongkou.</p>
<p>Detailed Account of the Fierce Battle in Pudong the Night Before</p>
<p>Since the exchange of fire between enemy ships and our garrison in Pudong the night before, the Japanese army clearly had other important plots, causing the situation in Pudong to suddenly become tense. At 10 a.m. yesterday, the two sides exchanged artillery fire fiercely again. At 11:30 a.m., seven enemy planes bombed our Pudong defenses indiscriminately, causing considerable losses, but our army was not moved. Our reporter personally went to Pudong yesterday afternoon to investigate, and the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Xinma Road Has Become a Battlefield</p>
<p>At 10:30 p.m. the night before, the sound of machine guns and artillery fire started again and became more intense. The two sides made contact in the Dongchang Road and Xinwei Road area, each using artillery to cover their advance. The battle was extraordinarily fierce. Our army fought bravely, driving back the enemy forces. The enemy forces broke through four times, but all failed. They were ultimately forced to retreat to the Mitsui Coal Yard. In this battle, because of the fierce artillery fire between the two sides, the Wu Family Ancestral Temple was completely destroyed. Places such as the Fifteen Rooms and the Eighteen Rooms were the focus of artillery fire for both sides. The area along Xinma Road has become a battlefield. Our army advanced, surrounding the enemy. However, because there were many obstacles in the area and the enemy forces were defending from a high position, it was not easy to resolve them for a while.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Landing Repelled by Our Army</p>
<p>The Japanese army plotted to take action in the Pudong area. Their marines, estimated at about four to five hundred men, landed at the Qichang Pier under the cover of enemy ships' artillery fire at around 7 p.m. the night before, using the Mitsui Coal Yard and the Nichiwa Cotton Mill as bases. Upon learning of this, our garrison immediately advanced, determined to drive them out. A fierce battle immediately erupted between the two sides. Our side launched a fierce attack on the Mitsui Yard and the Nichiwa Cotton Mill, while using machine guns to strafe the Japanese soldiers landing in Pudong. At that time, the enemy forces could not advance or retreat. Countless people who dropped their guns and drowned in the river and an unknown number were shot down by our army. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy ultimately failed, suffering heavy casualties. Our side suffered more than a dozen casualties. However, the coastal areas such as Yangjing in Pudong suffered slight damage due to the indiscriminate firing of guns by Japanese warships.</p>
<p>Japanese Factories and Warehouses Hit by Shells</p>
<p>Starting at 10 a.m. yesterday morning, the two sides exchanged artillery fire again. Our artillery team returned fire at the enemy warships in the Huangpu River, exchanging fire across the river. One of our shells hit the Huishan Wharf. In Pudong, the Nichiwa Cotton Mill, the Mitsui Coal Yard, etc., were also hit by shells and bombed. The Ice Factory Field was also hit by a shell.</p>
<p>Nearly a Thousand Enemy Soldiers Eliminated, More Than Half</p>
<p>According to military sources, the night before, about 500 enemy soldiers and about 200 plainclothes soldiers landed at the Xinbing Wharf (opposite the Shanghai Waterworks in the Public Concession) under the cover of enemy warships' artillery fire. They were immediately ambushed and surrounded by our garrison. After several hours of fierce fighting, more than half of them were eliminated. A small portion of the rest retreated miserably. Also, at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong the night before, several hundred enemy soldiers landed, attempting to occupy a new position in Pudong. After being defeated by our army, there were still more than one hundred people stubbornly resisting in the warehouses there. They are currently being surrounded.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, at about 3 a.m. yesterday morning, more than 500 enemy marines landed at the Mitsui Wharf in Pudong under the cover of artillery fire, firing fiercely at us with machine guns and small steel cannons. Our army fought bravely and finally drove the enemy back, fleeing hastily onto ships and escaping to the Yangshupu area.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Bomb Our Army Positions</h3>
<p>One Plane Shot Down and Burned; One of Our Planes Also Hit and Damaged</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, dark clouds covered the sky, and drizzle fell, providing another opportunity for the air force to operate. Before 11 a.m., in addition to continuously patrolling the Huangpu River to scout the movements of enemy warships and enemy forces, at 11:15 a.m., two of our air force bombers flew over the Huangpu River again to bomb enemy warships. Outside the Garden Bridge, a battle broke out in the sky with two enemy planes, which was extremely fierce. For a time, the sound of machine guns was as dense as a string of beads, and the enemy warships' anti-aircraft guns fired wildly. After six or seven minutes of combat, our planes flew away in different directions to the northwest. At 11:45 a.m., our air force squadron reappeared in the sky, flying at top speed, bombing enemy forces in the Yangshupu area, causing considerable losses to the enemy positions. Afterwards, two enemy fighters flew and patrolled over the Huangpu River from time to time. At 3 p.m., more than 20 enemy planes flew in teams to bomb the North Railway Station and Macheng Road area. Our air force also went out to respond to the battle, and the enemy planes hastily dropped their bombs and fled, it is said.</p>
<p>Bombing Enemy Warships, Our Plane Damaged</p>
<p>Yesterday, our air force continued to sortie. At 10:30 a.m., two of our planes flew to the sky over the Huangpu River to bomb the enemy flagship Izumo. In panic, the enemy fired anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns wildly into the sky. Our plane climbed high into the clouds, circled several times, and flew west. At 11 a.m., our air force sortied again, flying extremely low. In the Yangshupu area, they strafed with machine guns. The enemy's anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns fired together. Smoke filled the sky. Unfortunately, one of our planes was damaged, and its tail caught fire. It was forced to land. The other planes returned safely. Our army continued its efforts and flew in again at about 2 p.m. for reconnaissance, it is said.</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Enemy Planes Bomb Zhabei</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 2 p.m., the enemy first sent three seaplanes to scout our Zhabei area. Our army's anti-aircraft guns and machine guns fired together. The enemy planes escaped into the clouds after about ten minutes. Before half an hour had passed, enemy land-based biplane fighters and bombers flew from the north in five small groups, each team with three planes, totaling fifteen planes. They flew extremely high. When they reached the sky over Zhabei, they suddenly scattered. At the same time, the enemy used nine fighter planes flying high as cover, and six bombers took turns bombing our positions, constantly. At that time, the tactic adopted by each plane was that the six planes first flew in a circle in the high sky of the enemy's position. When flying to the east side, they suddenly turned sharply to the west and descended rapidly. After dropping the bomb, our army flew north again at high speed and then east, forming a semicircle. Thus, they circulated endlessly, taking turns dropping bombs. After half an hour, eight more planes were added. It was not until 4:30 p.m. that the enemy planes flew back to the north. Judging from their flight route, it must have been from an aircraft carrier outside the port, and there was no enemy airport base in that area. However, the writer later confirmed from all sides that although the enemy came to bomb in formation this time, our losses were extremely minimal, because the enemy planes flew too high when dropping bombs, so it was quite difficult to hit.</p>
<p>Considerable Losses in Pudong and Other Places</p>
<p>At 11:30 a.m. yesterday morning, seven enemy planes appeared in the sky over the Huangpu River. After circling and scouting our Pudong position, they began to drop bombs to threaten us. Although the bombs rained down, our army was not moved and responded calmly. After our army bombarded them with anti-aircraft guns for an hour, the enemy planes fled in panic. Most of the bombs dropped by the enemy planes fell in the area north of Dongchang Road, including Lan Nidu, Lujiazui, and Hongsheng Wharf, causing heavy losses. (Another report) In order to salvage the situation, the enemy army obtained assistance from newly arrived units and was arranging a new position, fearing our army's attack. Therefore, at 4 p.m. yesterday, they sent multiple land-based bombers, divided into three teams, flying from outside the Huangpu River. First, they circled back and forth in the Zhabei Yinxiang area, and then scattered and flew in all directions to bomb, dropping many bombs. For a time, there were loud noises like thunder, and black smoke soared into the sky. Then, in the northeast, a fire suddenly started, and the flames were extremely fierce. At that time, the east wind was strong, so the fire spread westward. It took about twenty minutes for the fire to begin to extinguish.</p>
<p>One Enemy Plane Hit and Burned</p>
<p>At about 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon, a large number of Japanese planes were discovered in Zhabei, about twenty or more, flying high in the sky, dropping about fifty bombs in various places, but most of them did not explode, so we did not suffer major losses. At about 10 a.m., there were also three enemy planes, which first turned from Shanghai to Zhabei. Our defending troops noticed them and immediately bombarded them with anti-aircraft guns. One plane was hit on its side, and a piece of steel plate the size of a tile, about four or five points thick and weighing four or five pounds, was shot down and fell at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Meibaige Road in the Public Concession, in front of the Dashun Gong Southern Goods Store. At that time, there were two Indian constables nearby, which was quite dangerous. Later, the store picked it up. It was discovered that the steel plate was shot down from the plane's engine, and one end had spiral patterns, so it was known that it must have been seriously injured. Currently, the above steel plate has been collected by the store. (Another report) At about 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon, eight enemy planes flew in formation to scout our army's positions in the Zhabei Hongkou area and dropped bombs, attempting to destroy our rear. Our army, waiting for the enemy planes to approach, fired anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns together, sweeping into the air. At that time, the fighting was very fierce. Among them, one twin-engine bomber was hit by our anti-aircraft machine gun. The fuselage was damaged, and it immediately fled with injuries. Unexpectedly, when flying across the river to the Qingyun Temple near the Dinghai Bridge in Yangshupu, in the direction of the Meifu Oil Depot, the plane lost its ability to steer and fell from the sky to the edge of the oil pool. With a loud noise, the entire plane was destroyed. A pilot and a Japanese soldier were killed instantly. Fortunately, the oil pool was not affected, which was fortunate. The other four enemy planes also had no intention of fighting and fled hastily. In this battle, one of our planes was damaged, and two soldiers died. The enemy dropped more than a dozen bombs, destroying several of our civilian houses, with no other losses, it is said.</p>
<h3>Under the Pressure of Our Artillery Fire, the Izumo Suffers Damage and Relocates</h3>
<p>Severely Damaged in the Stern, Losing Combat Power; Now Moored at the Gonghexing Wharf for Repairs</p>
<p>The Izumo, the main ship of the Japanese Third Fleet stationed in Shanghai, was anchored outside the Garden Bridge, using the concession as the headquarters for issuing orders and attacking our army. In order to avoid affecting the concession and preventing the air force from fully exerting its power to destroy it, we had to take a proper strategy to severely punish the ship. At about 9 p.m. on the 16th, amidst the heavy artillery fire of both sides, we bombed the ship with a certain explosive military device, hitting the stern immediately, causing severe damage and losing combat power. The ship then quietly relocated, mooring in the river at the Gonghexing Wharf downstream. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, our reporter drove to the area again in the faint light of dawn to inspect. Indeed, a cruiser had been moored in place of the original spot, while the ship was moored in the river at the Gonghexing Wharf for repairs. This move can reduce the danger to the safety of the concession, but it is still necessary to see what the ship will do in the future. The detailed situation of yesterday is compiled below.</p>
<p>Stern Damaged and Undergoing Repairs</p>
<p>The Japanese flagship Izumo, anchored in front of the Japanese Mail Boat Wharf, in front of the Japanese consulate, was heavily bombarded by our side the night before. The stern was damaged, and it left the Waitany Bridge at about 5 a.m. yesterday morning and moved to the second buoy in the river several hundred meters downstream, in front of the Gonghexing Wharf. At the original wharf, at 9 a.m. yesterday morning, a transport ship from Kobe unloaded a large amount of ammunition and then left.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy flagship Izumo, which was originally anchored north of the Waitany Bridge to command enemy forces in combat, has been damaged after being bombed several times by our bombers. On the 16th night, it was bombed with a certain explosive military device, causing several holes in the stern and suffering heavy damage. It immediately sailed away from the Japanese consulate and is now moored at the No. 2 Buoy opposite the Gonghexing Wharf for repairs. In addition, an enemy gunboat originally moored at the Yangjing Canal has also sailed to Gonghexing to moor, and a large cruiser is afraid of the Zhaoshangju Middle Warehouse, it is said.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency went to the edge of the Waitany Bridge yesterday morning to check. The original mooring location of the Izumo ship has been changed to a cargo ship from Osaka Company. Looking at the enemy ship Izumo at the Gonghexing Wharf from a distance, five enemy ships have been moored around it for protection. Because the ship was heavily damaged and its combat power has disappeared, it can no longer be attacked by our army, it is said.</p>
<p>Another report: At about 10 a.m. yesterday morning, an enemy transport ship arrived in front of the Japanese Mail Boat Wharf, with newly arrived reinforcements being unloaded. These reinforcements were selected from various divisions and mixed together, with an unknown number of people. Yesterday morning, they landed at the original anchorage of the Izumo ship.</p>
<p>Combat Power of the Izumo Flagship</p>
<p>The enemy ship Izumo is a first-class patrol ship of the third fleet commander's flagship and was built in Germany in 1900. The displacement is 9,100 tons, the ship length is 124.46 feet, the width is 58 feet, and it is equipped with four 20-centimeter heavy guns, twelve 15-centimeter guns, one anti-aircraft gun, two machine guns, two torpedoes, and a pair of reconnaissance aircraft. During the January 28 Shanghai War, the enemy ship led the fleet to invade China and was also bombed by our 19th Route Army with a certain explosive military device, but it unfortunately missed. Since then, the enemy ship has repeatedly violated our coastline. This time, it again led a team to invade China, and was injured and moved to anchorage under the attack of our planes and artillery the day before.</p>
<h3>The Magnificent Achievements of Our Army Attacking the Enemy's Nest in Tiantong'an</h3>
<p>The Enemy's Nest is Solid and Surrounded by Electric Current; It is Still Under Our Close Siege</p>
<p>(Special Report from Our Newspaper) Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War and the enemy's successive defeats, the enemy's headquarters, the Marine Corps headquarters, at the intersection of Tiantong'an Railway Station and Jiangwan Road has become isolated. It has long been surrounded by our army, but because the distance is relatively far, our army has repeatedly attempted to seize it, but all failed. According to military sources, the night before (the 16th), the enemy army, seeing that our side was gradually approaching, made a last-ditch effort, mobilizing more than 1,000 people. Under the cover of more than 20 armored vehicles and fierce machine gun artillery fire, they attacked our position in the direction of Qingyun Road. Our army resisted bravely, fighting fiercely for a long time, but because of the enemy's fierce momentum, our army could not withstand it and temporarily retreated. Then, they regrouped their forces and, together with the garrison from the Hongkou Park area on Jiangwan Road in the north and the Deswei Road area in the east, advanced in an encirclement, counterattacking the enemy's fort with extremely fierce artillery fire. Our army advanced without retreat, bravely competing to be the first, directly approaching the enemy headquarters. After several hours of bloody battle, the enemy army could not withstand it, suffering heavy casualties, and retreated in defeat to North Sichuan Road. Our army's forward troops had approached the enemy camp, only 200 meters away. At a single order, our daredevils charged desperately, directly attacking the enemy's nest, but they suffered a setback and failed to take it in one fell swoop, which was a great pity. According to a post-war investigation, the enemy headquarters was surrounded by electric current, and the walls around it were made of steel plates and cement, like iron walls and copper walls, extremely solid. However, our army has closely surrounded it and is slowly destroying it. Even with such solid defenses, it should not be difficult to take it down soon.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the night before, 1,500 enemy troops, under the cover of seven armored vehicles, attacked our Qingyun Road position and were repelled by our army. Taking advantage of the victory, our army counterattacked. By about 9 a.m. yesterday morning, our □□ Division □□□ Brigade, under the cover of heavy artillery, crossed the Qingyun Bridge on Qingyun Road, and the enemy retreated towards Baoshan Bridge. When our army attacked Qingyun Bridge, there were many thatched houses next to the bridge, and part of the enemy army used them as cover, lying in wait, firing machine guns densely at us. Many of our loyal and brave soldiers rolled into them on the ground, setting them on fire. The remaining enemies in the houses were burned to death, causing great confusion among most of the enemy army, and our army immediately charged forward, occupying the area. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties.</p>
<h3>After the Recovery of Chahar Northern Commercial Hub, Our Troops March Non-Stop Like a Hot Knife Through Butter</h3>

<h3>The Entire Luo Regiment Sacrificed Themselves in the Battle of Nankou</h3>
<p>Cannon fire can be heard within Beiping City. The battle on the Jinpu Railway Line is quiet.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to official sources, the battle in the Nankou area on the 14th of this month was extremely fierce. The enemy bombarded our positions with heavy artillery all day, firing approximately 5,000 rounds. At the same time, they used over thirty heavy tanks to launch a fierce assault on our positions. Our inner and outer trench defenses were destroyed. Luo Fanggui's unit, belonging to the 529th Regiment of Wang Zhonglian's division, fought bravely and staunchly, refusing to retreat, resulting in the entire regiment's sacrifice. Not a single person, including the regimental commander, survived. Their heroic sacrifice is unprecedented in modern warfare, surpassing even the spirit of the Japanese "human bullets" in the Russo-Japanese War. Later, reinforcements were dispatched by our side, and the enemy was defeated. The enemy's casualties were even greater than ours. This spirit of resistance is not only the most glorious in our nation's history but also a model for all soldiers in the country. It further strengthens the belief that the final victory in this war will belong to us. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>A Respectful Message to Compatriots in the Rear</h3>
<p>—Qi</p>
<p>Our country has been pushed to the brink step by step by the aggressors. It has no choice but to rise up and wage a sacred national war of self-defense. The prelude to a full-scale war has already begun. The rise and fall, the survival and extinction of our nation are at stake. The central government is anxious above, and the warriors are fighting hard at the front. The hopes of the people for the government for many years have been realized at once. What should we, the people in the rear, do with great determination and make a final effort? I respectfully offer a few suggestions to my dear compatriots.</p>
<p>There is a nation, then there is a people. All the property and interests of the people should be subject to the government's control at this critical juncture. Not only should the purchase of foreign exchange and the flight of capital be absolutely and automatically stopped, but bank deposits, except for living expenses and necessary purposes, should not be withdrawn too much, but temporarily used for government military purposes. Otherwise, if the country is lost, the assets will also belong to the enemy. Our people should be acutely aware of this.</p>
<p>Frontline operations must have well-fed soldiers and horses in order to fight the enemy bravely. All of our compatriots should enthusiastically donate money and materials, and donating taxes is the best way to go. Let the military authorities take control. Next are food, medicine, and winter clothing. As for unnecessary rewards, they do not seem essential and can be stopped to save expenses.</p>
<p>The food supply for the people in the rear must also be fully replenished. Although transportation has been suspended, there are still railways that can be used. We must find ways to replenish food supplies from all sources to avoid panic. On the one hand, the hoarding and price gouging of the rice industry should be strictly prohibited. On the other hand, we should also try our best to dredge the sources of oil, salt, vegetables, fuel, etc., to stabilize the people's hearts.</p>
<p>The situation of the poor and distressed refugees is truly pitiful and can be worrying for local security. Although there are already charitable organizations setting up shelters, that is the best. On the one hand, provide temporary relief, and on the other hand, gradually send them back to their hometowns. This will not only reduce the local food supply, but also benefit the security of the rear.</p>
<p>Air warfare is our country's first test in foreign wars. Our compatriots, driven by patriotism, applaud and cheer, and shout slogans, which is not reprehensible. However, air combat is very dangerous. All of our compatriots, when encountering air combat, should not go out unless necessary. Passing pedestrians can temporarily take refuge in nearby houses to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Let us keep these useful bodies to prepare for the final battle against the enemy.</p>
<p>The government is determined and preparing for a long-term war, hoping to win the final victory. The loss or gain of one place is irrelevant to the overall situation. We need not rejoice wildly at the news of victory, nor need we be discouraged by the news of defeat. All hearsay rumors and false reports from wireless stations can be ignored. Finally, I especially hope that the press will find ways to verify the information they obtain and provide faithful reports. Otherwise, it is better to have no reports than to have false ones. I hope my colleagues will encourage each other.</p>

<h3>British Newspapers Filled with Reports of the Shanghai War</h3>
<p>Calling Chiang Kai-shek "Cromwell" - British Mediation Unlikely to Succeed</p>
<p>[London] British newspapers' news columns, art and literature columns, broadcast reports, and movie newsreels are all related to the Shanghai incident, indicating that people throughout the United Kingdom are deeply concerned about the Shanghai war and its related issues. British political and opinion circles are regretting that Japan has not made sincere efforts to prevent the deterioration of the situation and do not believe Japan's claim of self-defense, as Japanese troops are currently fighting in Chinese territory. Many believe that Tokyo may not be willing to accept British mediation, so the possibility of British mediation is currently unrealizable. The Daily Express stated that Japan's invasion of China is almost identical to Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia. The newspaper also praised Chairman Chiang as a modern Cromwell and said that if the two major trends of nationalism and revolution unite into a great force, China will one day drive out the invaders, as France did in 1793 and Russia did in 1920. The Daily Telegraph stated that the British government is facilitating the evacuation of British women and children from Shanghai. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, this is the only possible way to prevent the desperate fighting in the area from causing disputes in international relations. As far as the current situation is concerned, both China and Japan are unwilling to cease fire, and there is no hope that the Concession will not suffer further tragedies. The Morning Post stated that many British friends of Japan, regardless of whether the aims that Japan claims to have are sincere, cannot help but say that the means Japan has taken to achieve these aims are unwise. Others cannot judge when Japan's patience has run out, but is the sudden dispatch of a large fleet the most appropriate remedy for the killing of two sailors? (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 17th)</p>
<p>[London] Many newspapers commented on the war between China and Japan. The Liberal Party's News Chronicle stated, "If Japan had not invaded Chinese territory by force, China would not have needed to defend itself with bombers. Therefore, the countries concerned should protest to Japan about the fact that Chinese aircraft bombs accidentally landed in the Shanghai Concession, and not to China." The Liberal Party's Manchester Guardian stated, "There is no doubt that Japan has begun a large-scale war. Many people believe that the scope of this war is so large that it could bankrupt Japan. It would be futile to mediate at this time." The Conservative Party's Daily Telegraph stated, "The British government is advising its women and children to evacuate from Shanghai and is facilitating this. This is the only action that can be taken at present to reduce the crisis faced by the expatriates." The Conservative Party's Morning Post stated, "All countries concerned, large and small, cannot be indifferent to the war in Shanghai. If China intends to lodge a complaint with the League of Nations, then based on the experience of the past five years, it will only make the situation more confusing, and it should not be encouraged."

<h3>Minister Kong Establishes Loan Agreement with Czechoslovakia</h3>

<p>[Vienna] Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, Kong Xiangxi, left here today for Salzburg, where he will meet with Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg. According to reports, Kong signed a long-term loan agreement of ten million pounds with Czechoslovakia in Prague. (Sixteenth National Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙Prague, Czech Republic It is rumored that Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China Kong Xiangxi met with Soviet Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Litvinov in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic. Czech officials stated that it is highly unbelievable. Vice President Kong was extremely busy during this period and had no time for any secret meetings. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Vienna] The rumor that Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, met with Soviet Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Litvinov in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic, is considered unfounded by Chinese officials here.

<h3>The Banking Industry Resumed Business Yesterday, and the City's Finances Are Extremely Stable</h3>
<p>All Sectors Pool Funds to Purchase Large Quantities of Grain, and the Food Problem Will Not Be Difficult to Solve</p>
<p>All Silver and Money Businesses Open</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the banking industry in the city was ordered by the Ministry of Finance to close for two days in order to cope with the financial situation during the extraordinary period. After discussing the methods and submitting them to the Ministry of Finance, it was officially reopened at 9 am yesterday. However, some banks are close to the war zone, and in order to prepare for emergencies, they have set up offices in safe areas. In order to facilitate depositors, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China have extended their business hours from 8 am to 5 pm. This morning, many people went to various banks to withdraw money to meet their urgent needs, but the order was very good. Foreign banks have also opened. As for the withdrawal of deposits by banks and businesses, they all abide by the seven temporary measures for safe finance announced by the Ministry of Finance, and the four supplementary measures proposed by the two industries.</p>
<p>The Money Exchange Association of this city stipulated that the exchange rate for one yuan banknotes should be 0.99 yuan in legal tender, 1.2 yuan in small foreign currency, and 3,000 copper coins. A handling fee of one point will be charged for five-yuan banknotes, and a handling fee of two points for ten-yuan banknotes, and so on.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Facilitate Foreigners</p>
<p>The Shanghai Qin Wushi Bao reported that several foreign banks in this city opened their western district branches yesterday morning to facilitate the departure of foreigners from Shanghai. HSBC set up a temporary office in a British residence at 1288 Jing'an Temple Road. Citibank opened an office at 9 Avenue Petain in the French Concession. Chase Bank was at 12 of the same road. The Chartered Bank did not formally open, but it was reported that depositors with urgent needs could negotiate withdrawals and enter and exit through the back door. The same was true for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which entered and exited through Beijing Road. The Shanghai Foreign Banks Association will hold a meeting at 9 am this morning to discuss the overall situation and respond to depositors' withdrawal methods.</p>
<p>There Are No Financial Problems in This City</p>
<p>According to Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, he told reporters yesterday that after the banks in this city resumed business today (yesterday) according to the order of the Ministry of Finance, the business situation was very stable and there was no bank run. Therefore, there are no financial problems in this city. However, more attention should be paid to food at present. However, banks, money businesses, and rice merchants have pooled funds to purchase large quantities of grain, so the food problem will not be difficult to solve in the future.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Allocated 60,000 Yuan to Rescue and Repatriate Refugees</h3>
<p>Raising Vehicles and Ships to Send in Batches, Refugees are Dispersed to Reduce the Burden of Food</p>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Committee, which was organized by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in conjunction with local associations and various charitable organizations and hometown associations, has established more than 90 shelters. In addition to refugees being sent to other places one after another, there are now more than 40,000 people in the shelters, and a large amount of food is needed for daily supplies. Rescue and repatriation also require cars and gasoline, and all kind people are expected to donate generously. The municipal government, in view of the fact that rescuing refugees is an urgent task at present, has decided to allocate 60,000 yuan to instruct the Social Affairs Bureau to subsidize the Relief Committee's expenses, and has allocated another 40,000 yuan for the expenses of rescuing wounded soldiers. It has also telegraphed relevant authorities to raise vehicles and ships to send them in batches, and at the same time requested that counties in the interior of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces set up shelters to disperse the refugees in Shanghai and reduce the burden of food in Shanghai. The Relief Committee has been working extremely hard in recent days, and the shelter group is planning to build reed sheds in open areas for emergency use due to the continuous stream of refugees. The Public Works Department of the Public Concession has allowed all safe areas in the Concession's cinemas to be opened and converted into shelters as much as possible, including the Guanghua Grand Theater. The repatriation group is organizing the refugees in various shelters in preparation for sending them out of Shanghai in batches within a few days. According to statistics, the various hometown associations have sent no less than 100,000 refugees back to their hometowns by land and water. The medical group has designated Chinese and Western doctors to rotate daily to diagnose and treat the diseases of refugees in various shelters, and is planning to set up refugee hospitals. As for refugee mothers, they have contacted the Chinese-German Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital to send them to the hospital for delivery. The staff of the association are mostly officials transferred from the Municipal Party Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and various groups, and there are also those who voluntarily report to serve. Director Pan will represent the municipal government to inspect the various shelters on a daily basis, and will also go to various hospitals to慰问wounded soldiers.</p>
<h3>British and American Women and Children Temporarily Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>British and American expatriates in Shanghai are temporarily leaving Shanghai because the women and children are timid. Therefore, they are taking refuge in Hong Kong and Luzon nearby. When the situation eases in the future, they will return to Shanghai. As for the British and American men in Shanghai, they have decided not to leave Shanghai to continue their business and protect their property. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>American Expats Go to Luzon in Three Batches</p>
<p>American expatriates in Shanghai have begun to evacuate their wives and children. In advance, the US Consulate General discussed with the Dollar Steamship Lines to temporarily change the routes of the postal ships to transport American expatriate wives and children out of Shanghai. The Dollar Steamship Lines will begin selling tickets for the President Jefferson and President McKinley on the 16th and 17th specifically for the evacuation of American expatriate wives and children. Initially, the two ships originally planned to go directly to Hong Kong, but they received a telegram from Hong Kong informing them that the hotels in Hong Kong were fully booked and could not accommodate such a large number of Americans. Therefore, it was decided to send the batch of women and children to Luzon. At 10 am yesterday, the first batch of more than 350 people boarded the President Jefferson to the Philippines, and there were also more than 100 people in third class. The first batch also had more than 500 people, who are scheduled to be transported to Luzon by the President McKinley at 10 am today. There will be a third batch on the 20th, and it is reported that there will be more than 600 people traveling on the President Hoover.</p>
<p>British Women and Children Evacuate to Hong Kong</p>
<p>British women and children in Shanghai have also begun to evacuate. The total number is 1,700 people. The British Consul has agreed with the Jardine Matheson and China Navigation Company to transport them to Hong Kong for temporary residence on both days yesterday and today. The Jardine Matheson's "Lykenspoldana" carried 800 British children yesterday. The China Navigation Company's "Asiatic Queen" will not go to Canada today, but will specifically carry 900 British women and children to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Stateless Foreigners Will Not Evacuate</p>
<p>According to rumors, the Public Works Department has ordered stateless foreigners in the Public Concession to move out of the Concession. This statement is completely untrue. The Public Works Department has no news to provide regarding the evacuation of foreigners. Therefore, please do not inquire at the Bureau again.</p>
<p>Three Thousand Japanese Leave Shanghai in a Panic</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Japanese businesses have been suspended, making it impossible for them to continue living in Shanghai. The Japanese in the Hongkou area gathered at No. 5 Bund a few days ago, with a total of 3,000 people, and left Shanghai for their country in a hurry yesterday afternoon. It was reported that when Japanese women left Shanghai, many of their children were lost, and some even cried out loud.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Sincerely Protects the Safety of Life and Property</h3>
<p>Eight Hundred British Soldiers Have Arrived in Shanghai for Reinforcement, and Two American Warships Have Been Ordered to Sail to Shanghai Quickly</p>
<p>The Public Works Department Implements Emergency Measures</p>
<p>The Public Works Department has posted a notice implementing emergency measures.

<p>Eight Hundred British Soldiers Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>In view of the outbreak of the Shanghai War and in order to protect the safety of the Concession, the British Consulate General specially transferred a unit of infantry from the British Army stationed in Hong Kong, totaling more than 800 people, to Shanghai for defense. They set off on the Blue Funnel Line's "Molong" on the 14th of this month, and arrived at Wusongkou at noon yesterday. The British naval authorities stationed in Shanghai immediately dispatched the cruisers H46 and H52 to Wusongkou to welcome the infantry into the Huangpu River. They stopped at the Yangjing Wharf in Pudong at about 4 pm. The infantry landed that night and joined the defense along the northern Suzhou River. The Waitan Bridge was also taken over by the infantry. It is reported that a squad of British riflemen, totaling more than 300 people, has also been ordered to depart from Hong Kong and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai by ship on the 19th.</p>
<p>Two American Warships Ordered to Sail to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that Rear Admiral Yan Lu'er, Commander of the United States Asiatic Fleet, ordered two American destroyers stationed in Yantai yesterday morning (the 16th) to come to Shanghai immediately. It is expected that they will arrive tonight. When asked whether the remaining ships of the American fleet stationed in the north will all come to Shanghai in the near future, Yan did not give a definite answer. After the two destroyers arrive in Shanghai, there will be a total of six American warships stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Western Prison and Police Station Were Hit by Artillery Shells</h3>
<p>Many Prisoners Were Killed and Injured</p>
<p>There are about 15,000 prisoners in the Western Prison on Ward Road. Although it is close to the front line, the prison cannot be moved, so it is still being held. The Huishan Police Station was also not evacuated because of this. At 8:30 yesterday morning, a part of the prison was suddenly hit by artillery shells, and at the same time, the Public Works Department Police Station on Baoding Road and the surrounding area of the Huishan Police Station were also hit by shells. It is reported that there were many deaths and injuries. The police station is currently trying to investigate, and the number of deaths and injuries is still difficult to know.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Train Opened Five Passenger Trains Yesterday</h3>
<p>Eight or Nine People Were Killed by Bridges, Listen to Instructions and Do Not Rush</p>
<p>Large truck traffic between Shanghai and Hangzhou still operated normally yesterday. Yesterday, the South Station opened a total of five passenger trains at 8:00 am, 10:10 am, 12:00 pm, 4:00 pm, and 6:20 pm. However, due to the large number of people, although the road staff tried to add carriages to each passenger train, it was still not enough to carry them. When the train was about to leave, some people climbed onto the roof of the car, causing one passenger train to be hit in the head by the bridge when it was halfway to Songjiang Zhongtu No. 31 Bridge, and eight or nine people who were hit and fell into the water and were tragically killed, and many people were injured. They were all rescued. Therefore, our refugee people must know that the authorities will do their utmost to maintain it, but they must strictly observe the order, listen to the guidance of the road station staff, and do not rush or panic. The result of rushing and panicking is enough to cause trampling, death and injury, and hinder traffic work.</p>
<h3>Mail on the North Bank of Suzhou River is Sent from Fujian Road Post Office</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that the north bank of the Suzhou River has become a war zone and it is impossible to select and deliver mail, the Municipal Postal Administration of this city has specially handed over the mail on the north bank of the Suzhou River to the Fujian Road Post Office for distribution. Residents on the north bank of the Suzhou River can pick up their mail at the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Explosion at the Nishikyo Ammunition Factory</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Army Ministry issued a public announcement today stating that an ammunition factory in Nishikyo exploded yesterday, injuring 22 workers and destroying 9 factory buildings and 3 civilian houses. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
