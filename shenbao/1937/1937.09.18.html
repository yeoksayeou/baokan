<h3>昨日大雨作戰困難前線各路僅有小接觸</h3>
<p>敵各項重軍器俱失其效能　我反攻楊行有激烈遭遇戰　敵又進襲浦東被我軍擊退</p>
<p>羅店附近各村落血戰一畫夜後、頑敵已被我擊退、昨日午後以迄今晨、雙方因天雨無大激戰、我陣綫不動、劉行方面、敵集中砲擊、但我陣地絕無所損、江灣閘北一帶、昨晚時有小衝突、機關槍步槍聲淸晰可聞、敵均不得逞、敵竄出羅店襲我劉行之計劃失敗、頃又有集中敵艦、窺我瀏河·楊林口·七丫口·等處模樣、據確報、原泊淞口一帶之敵艦、分泊石洞·瀏河·楊林口·七丫口·等處江面、集結於瀏河者尤多、合計停泊以上各處敵艦、其總數已達五十艘左右、楊林口七丫口敵艦、昨竟日斷續向我江邊陣地砲擊、似係試探性質、我軍早有嚴密準備、敵來决予迎頭痛擊、</p>
<p>昨竟日大雨如注、羅店楊行江灣各綫、雖不斷的有局部之接觸、但因天雨關係、雙方軍事行動、較為困難、範圍亦不能擴大、敵軍各項重軍器、俱不能發揮其威力、田野泥水濘滑、敵軍之坦克車、更全失效力、敵機因雨之故、前綫活動、亦大為減少、昨日、敵軍除以後方大砲、向我各陣地、作漫無目標之亂轟外、毫無其他活動可能、所有砲彈、落於泥水之中、炸力全失、我軍各綫之反攻、亦暫時停止、各處陣地、並無變化、</p>
<h3>我反攻楊行得手收復各重要村落</h3>
<p>雙方昨有激烈砲戰</p>
<p>我軍反攻楊行、頗爲得手、已將左右各重要村落、完全收復、前鋒已進至楊行郊外、昨日因雨、軍行稍滯、敵軍砲隊、欲阻我軍前進、昨竟日以不息之砲火、向我後方劉行永安橋各處陣地、亂加轟擊、午後砲聲更密、隆隆不絕、聲震遐邇、我軍砲隊、亦予以還擊、雙方砲戰、至傍晚稍息、昨晚深夜、又在猛烈砲戰之中、</p>
<p>敵佔楊行之後、繼續循公路前進、進犯永安橋、企圖攻擊我劉行陣地、前日下午、我軍在後方重砲掩護之下、開始全綫向敵軍反攻、左右兩翼、同時推進、雨後泥濘、敵軍坦克車全失效用、我軍乘機向東疾進、敵傷亡遍地、狼狽潰退、我軍當將左右附近各重要村落、馮家宅沈家宅西沈家宅等、先後收復、仍循公路繼續向楊行進逼、傍晚已進抵楊行附近、是晚敵軍向我軍反攻甚烈、企圖奪回陣地、我軍奮勇應戰、憑險固守、敵屢次進衝、俱遭擊退、昨晨尚有激戰、至午、反攻之敵始退、</p>
<h3>敵犯劉行計畫失敗</h3>
<p>敵軍因羅店方面之失利、楊行方面、我車之壓迫前進、乃不得不改變戰略、從江灣中路進攻、企圖突破我該區東南各陣地、前晚集中炮火、向我江灣陣地、作竟日不息之轟擊、企圖掩護其部隊前進、我軍早有準備、防範森嚴、其砲火因雨後完全不能發生威力、我守軍沈着應戰、俟其逼近我陣地時、機槍手溜彈、突然同時發作、敵軍倉皇失措、不及逃歸者、俱犧牲於機槍之下、我軍躍起進掃、敵遂潰退、昨全日大雨、該綫戰事、亦遂沉寂、</p>
<p>中央社云、前昨兩日、敵軍作戰計劃、似在企圖突破我江灣方面之東南兩綫、並進攻劉行、包抄羅店方面我軍之右翼、惟結果均經我軍奮勇擊退、敵未得逞、</p>
<h3>敵攻愛國女學敗退</h3>
<p>虹口方面之敵海軍陸戰隊、輔以正式陸軍、前晚藉大砲之掩護、又自敵海軍司令部與虹口公園、沿江灣路向愛國女學進犯、當經我前哨士兵發見、乃伏於防禦物後、俟其逼近、以機關槍密集掃射、當斃敵多人、敵卽散伏地面、與我相持、激戰澈夜、迄未得逞、</p>
<h3>閘北我軍猛攻頑敵</h3>
<p>前晚我閘北方面駐軍、乘新雨初霽星月交輝之際、為先發制人計、突以生力軍向虹口及閘北敵軍沿綫猛烈攻擊、敵伏處防禦物後、不敢出而抵抗、僅以大砲向我北車站及閘北一帶轟擊甚久、至昨晨拂曉、天又微雨、我軍卽退守原防、砲聲亦趨靜寂、</p>
<h3>閘北江灣澈宵砲戰</h3>
<p>（本報特訊）昨晨一時五十分、閘北大通庵·八字橋·以迄江灣一綫、敵利用重砲、掩護大隊敵軍、向我陣地進襲、我空軍亦立以密集之機槍·手溜彈·小鋼砲·及迫擊砲之猛烈火力、加以迎頭痛擊、同時我××方面之砲兵陣地、亦重砲猛拊敵軍之背、致敵陣及敵艦、均感受我軍重大威脅、當時有一停在浦東三井碼頭附近之敵艦、被我砲彈擊中、受創甚重、倉皇移去、至三時許、重炮之聲漸稀、但北站附近之步槍機關槍及迫擊砲聲、仍極猛烈、而以匯山及榆林路區之北約二英里處之戰况、尤為激烈、但結果我軍因防禦鞏固、仍屹立原陣綫、而敵方因採取攻勢、致傷亡綦重、</p>
<p>中央社云、昨晨一時許、楊樹浦方面之敵軍、砲兵陣地開砲向我北站方面轟擊、我砲兵亦立卽以重砲還擊、歷一小時有半、砲聲始漸稀少、敵步兵於砲火掩護之下、午夜向我北站方面進犯、激戰至昨晨拂曉、卒被我軍擊退、敵軍受創甚鉅、</p>
<p>昨午敵海軍陸戰隊西北一英里處有砲戰、虹口公園北面鄰近、發生火警數起、又匯山及楊樹浦區域內有兩處於午後一時許起火、北四川路·靶子路附近、亦有火警一起、</p>
<h3>楊樹浦敵進犯未逞</h3>
<p>引翔區我軍退守黃興路一綫、惟沿租界北部之綫、則仍在固守中、敵連日在黃興路其美路兩處屢次進犯、均被我擊退後、前日傍晚起、楊樹浦之敵、乃沿租界綫向我襲擊、實行其中央突破戰策、企圖斷我該區駐軍之後路我軍沉着應付、以機關槍掃射、並以大砲射擊、予敵重創、激戰澈夜、至昨晨（十七）拂曉、敵始不支而退、</p>
<h3>敵昨犯浦東又失敗</h3>
<p>敵進犯浦東之企圖、現益趨積極、昨農一時許、我駐軍發現小艇數艘、滿載敵軍、向岸駛來、企圖乘虛登陸、當卽以機關槍掃射、敵知我有備、卽停止前進、時停泊於浦江中之敵艦、卽以大砲向我陣地轟擊、我亦以大砲還擊、隆隆之聲、震驚全市、我軍在密集砲火下、堅守陣地、絕不退卻、敵艇無法駛近、相持久之、乃悄然而去、</p>
<h3>敵機一架被我擊燬</h3>
<p>中央社蘇州十七日電、頃據前綫歸來某軍官談稱、十六日下午二時三十分、有敵機三架、在大塲江灣間向我陣地投彈、中有一機、被我軍擊中、頓時油箱起火、旋卽墜於我陣地中焚燬、機師亦均焚斃、</p>
<h3>敵又增援軍四千人</h3>
<p>據確息、敵陸軍又有一部開到、約四千人、係屬於第九師團、當在虬江碼頭登陸後、卽派赴市中心區之西增援、</p>
<h3>敵巨型艦又來一艘</h3>
<p>排水量三萬三千三百噸之敵大號戰鬥艦長門號、已於昨日上午自吳淞口三峽水江面駛入長江、停泊瀏河附近江面、同時另有敵巨型戰鬥艦一艘、駛滬泊長江口、該艦排水量、為二萬七千噸、日本之有此項向樣之戰鬥艦、連此艦在內、共僅八艘、</p>
<h3>浦東又遭敵機投彈</h3>
<p>昨日上午九時至十二時間、敵軍水上飛機肆意活動、十時二十分、一架飛往浦東、在開灤煤礦公司碼頭以南四分之一英里處投彈、越二十分鐘、又有一架在陸家嘴安利洋行棧房後面擲彈數枚、我軍、開機關砲射擊、十時五十分、又有水上飛機一架飛經浦東上空、我軍隊、立開機關砲掃射、</p>
<h3>痛記今日“九一八”六週年</h3>
<p>全市一律下半旗　并舉行抗敵宣誓</p>
<p>溯自九一八事變發生後、暴日强佔我東北、我雖一再容忍、敵反變本加厲、侵凌日甚、迄於今日、已足六週、暴日更强佔我華北、進擾我華中及華南、使我大好河山、幾無時無地不受暴力之威脅、我上海一區、受暴敵之蹂躪尤甚、本市特別市黨部、特規定紀念辦法五項、通告全市各界、其辦法、㊀全市一律下半旗、㊁全市市民素食一天、并以省下之款慰勞將士、㊂提倡“光餅”代餐、㊃舉行抗敵宣誓、㊄舉行精神國防運動、事關抗敵救國、希望全市市民、能切實奉行、表揚我民氣、宣示我抗戰之决心、值茲暴敵肆暴正甘、又逢“九一八”六週紀念、凡我國人、痛憤殊深、本市各界為表示抗敵决心、特於今日中午、舉行嚴肅隆重之宣誓典禮、其辦法於今日上午十一時半、用無綫電向全市市民說明舉行宣誓之意義、及舉行宣誓之辦法、至十一時三刻、廣播黨歌唱片、正午十二時、全市市民舉行宣誓、在沿路兩旁店舖均張貼誓詞紙、各店舖收音機、於十一時半起、一律收聽宣誓節目、當正午十二時舉行宣誓時不論途間行人及車輛、應一律停止、其他市民亦應停止其一切行動、端正起立、先行靜默三分鐘、靜默畢、卽舉右手、舉行宣誓、除沿途由童子軍隨地指導外、在家庭由家長、在商店工廠由經理廠長或其他負責人、在學校由校長或其他敎師、領導舉行、表示一致擁護政府、服從領袖、犧性一切、抗戰到底之决心、藉以宣揚民族我統一之意旨云、</p>
<p>又本市為紀念九一八、鮮明抗敵意識、並紀念戚繼光征倭功績起見、特提倡於每年本日製食光餅、並由市商會通告茶食業餅乾業等公會、大量製備、以供需要、茲聞此項光餅、希望能深入民間、家家戶戶、各自製食、俾其意識更能普遍、特發表其製料如下、麵粉一斤、芝蔴五錢、糖二兩、鹽五錢、猪油三錢、生油三錢、發粉少許、以上分量做二十四枚、每枚直徑約三英寸厚約二分、</p>
<h3>河山變色</h3>
<h3>東京民衆覺悟反軍閥空氣濃厚</h3>
<p>智識份子攻擊重臣軍部　海軍上尉在滬戰死空中</p>
<p>東京通信、最近日本智識份子、秘密出版小册甚多、憲兵司令部查得有“尊皇討奸之檄”·“獄中手記”·“公民合體之大陰謀”·等、皆袒護二二六事件之內容、而導有關係之人於有利者、且攻擊重臣軍部、意欲紊亂軍秩、妨碍治安、現於八月二十三日、已捕得關係者十九人、送交檢事局、此等出版物、已佈滿全國、或貼火車中便所內、或寫入軍隊中、總之多攻擊軍部首腦及元老重臣者、頗有不可收拾之勢、</p>
<p>日本新進作家矢崎彈、最近為警局捕去、雜誌“早座”編輯者山本和夫、亦同時被捕、據當時稱、矢崎今春曾遊上海、與中國左翼作家王統照·胡風·等往來、歸國後、與中國人民戰綫派聯絡、以文藝謀大衆左翼化、故致被捕、其表面理由雖如此、實則最近凡與中國人交往之日人、俱在恐怖中正當擬大事搜捕也、</p>
<p>在上海廣德亂擲炸彈之日機中、有海軍上尉上敷領淸者、在八月二十九日戰死空中、此人乃兵學校五十八期畢業生、對於運動、無所不能、爲全能人材、且田徑賽曾保持某項記錄、故噩耗傳來、各界多惜之、按日本海軍飛行技術、本來平常、而在沿海一帶任警戒猶可、若派出作戰、實甚幼稚、此人雖為全材運動家、而飛行術則本來未必高明也、</p>
<h3>羅店鎮戰役猛烈</h3>
<p>敵遭重創無再犯之力　我軍至鎮東郊外佈防</p>
<p>我軍收復羅店鎮後、敵軍尚欲加以否認、謂羅店仍在敵軍之手、但昨日敵軍招待西報記者時、敵代表發言人告以“日軍正擬將羅店區內之我軍、驅逐出外”、我軍之收復羅店、豈非不打自招、彰彰明矣、如果我軍未曾收復羅店、羅店區內、亦何必攻擊我軍、所謂欲蓋彌彰者是也、</p>
<p>中央社云、運日戰事重心、在羅店一綫敵傾全力來犯、我奮勇抗戰、該鎮失而復得、淑里橋往復爭奪、一日之間、有達三次以上者、其戰况之激烈、不亞於虬江碼頭八字橋之役、敵遭此重創、暫無再犯之力、而敵於狼狽潰退之際、遺屍遍野、我軍一面追擊至鎮東郊外佈防、一面正收拾敵軍殘骸、計在千數以上、並發現中級軍官兩名、自羅店後退之敵、狼狽不堪、退出之時、將羅店附近南北各村落、焚燒甚烈、掩護其退却、我軍左翼進抵張家堰後、已在竇家弄附近、與敵發生激戰、我軍迫擊砲隊、大發武力、將敵坦克車擊毀多輛、步兵則在重炮掩護之下、繼續猛進、中路戰事、亦異常猛烈、淑里橋之敵、越隄向我錢宅小竹園等處攻擊、南北塘口、二日以來、劇戰未息、昨晚該方面之血戰、尤為慘烈、我軍仍堅守原有陣地、進攻我北朱店右冀陣地之敵、來勢猛烈、敵因羅店戰事不利、傾全力攻我北朱店、企圖牽制、經我軍奮勇撲擊、竟日竟夜、浴血應戰、已將該方面敵軍、完全擊潰、若干小股、已被我殲滅、</p>
<h3>今晨消息</h3>
<p>據午夜所得報吿、㊀我砲兵昨日異常活躍、□□方面及□□方面之砲兵陣地、昨午起分別施擊虹口及楊行一帶敵軍陣地、敵軍受損甚鉅、虹口方面曾有多處着彈起火、㊁羅店及楊行附近、昨晨曾有激烈之遭遇戰、惟陣綫無變動、㊂江灣方面及引翔鄉西區、曁租界北部邊境之陣地、殊為沉寂、僅時有哨兵警戒之來福槍聲、打破雨中沉寂之空氣、我前綫仍扼守江灣跑馬廳一帶陣地、㊃閘北一帶、亦僅有小接觸、並無激戰、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>淸算六年來的血賬</h3>
<p>— 賓</p>
<p>“九一八”的六周年來臨了。</p>
<p>“九一八。”這慘痛的一九一八。”這恥辱的“九一八。”在沉默的苦悶中悄悄地過去了六年。在以往的六年中每年到了這一天。我們甚至不能公開痛快的來紀念它。我們熾盛的怒火只能在內心裏燒。我們悲憤的血淚只能在暗地裏流。</p>
<p>然而在今天。情形却完全不同了。我們四萬五千萬的偉大民族已經怒吼起來。我們神聖的全民抗戰已經轟轟烈烈地展開了。在華北。在華中。我們英勇的戰士前仆後繼的正在向敵人厮殺。我全國同胞誰都下了抗戰到底的决心。六年以来。我們東北以及冀察一部五千萬的同胞受够了敵人的凌辱。我們的主權和領士受够了敵人的蹂躏。我們的文化受够了敵人的摧殘。到今天。我們要跟敵人來淸算這六年來的血賬了。</p>
<p>日本帝國主義一贯的侵略行為。六年以來。沒有一天停止過。從遼寧吉林黑龍江的被佔領。熱河的淪陷。冀東二十二縣偽政府的成立。華北的特殊化。豐台的被佔以至盧溝橋事件的爆發。都是日帝國主義侵略的成果。日帝國主義侵略我國的領土是决沒有止境的。</p>
<p>而且。伴着軍事侵略的進展。日帝國主義還用了種種毒辣的方法來打擊我們。它嗾使日韓浪人進行大規模的走私。以破壤我們經濟的命脈。它利用失意政客和軍閥。以分化我們的中央政府和地方當局。它甚至在華北各地遍設吸毒機關毒化中國。為的是要消滅我們中華民族的人種。其他如奴化教育的實施。“特務機關”的遍設無一不是企圖滅亡中國的狠毒的陰謀。</p>
<p>這一大篇的血賬。現在是到了總淸算的時候了。中華四萬五千萬的人民。不論階級。不論黨派。已在“抗敵”的目標下像鐵一樣地團結起來。我們要用血來洗雪我們的恥辱。來拯救我們被奴役的五千萬同胞。來收回我們的失地。來爭取我們整個民族的生存。</p>
<p>“九一八”六周年了。我國的歷史開始寫到最光榮最燦爛的一頁。兩個月來抗戰的結束證明了我們的戰鬥力量並不弱。證明了我們士氣的旺盛遠勝於敵人。證明了國際的同情都是屬於我們這方面。我們已有了更大的自信。我們將更堅定更持久的抗戰下去。非至奪回我們全部的失地。洗雪我們的恥辱。誓不罷休。今年的“九一八”還不過是我們神聖抗敵的起點。明年今天。我門相信總可以到瀋陽去跟東北的同胞“額手相慶”了。</p>

<p>軍費膨脹貿易逆轉　勝負之局不待蓍卜　—英金融泰晤士報之論評—</p>
<p>［倫敦］金融泰晤士報評論日本之財政及作戰力、謂日本以前之冒險行動及其海陸空軍費之大擴張、已使日本財政結構大為虛弱、然若謂日本財政卽將崩潰、則未免時機太早、至於日幣之安定、則於正確日本貿易平衡之逆勢、因戰事而愈增甚、今又促成抑低幣值之可能矣、日本預算案之財政可認為危險、蓋在平時、日本資金市塲應付需要、猶覺拮据、今欲籌集其必要之債款而不窮於羅掘、殆亦難矣、日本之好戰、乃國民黏着性達於更大的程度之結果、以事實言、除經濟與財政外、日本在各點上固强有力也、是以其戰爭乃與時候相角逐、戰費旣逈非取之不盡者、而財政上純粹通貨膨脹之方法亦有限度、况有此時候中、日本在國際陣綫上、又非處於必不可破之地位乎、雖英美對日加以抵制、日本尚能自給、然其原料之供給、不久即將告罄、何况蘇聯干涉、時覺可虞、縱歐洲局勢不定、蘇聯干涉未必立卽實現、然終有突然實現之可能、果爾、則勝負之大局定矣、綜之、日本現以兇多吉少之局勢、行此冒險大事、惟吾人亦不宜遽輕易加以預料、蓋結實的國家努力、常迅速克底於成、此乃證諸近事而屢見不鮮者也云、（中央社十七日路透電）</p>

<h3>英法决定撤銷西班牙海面監察</h3>
<p>不干涉政策仍不變　意德對之殊為冷淡</p>
<p>［倫敦］英法兩國决議罷行西班牙四周之海軍監管、因從事此項工作之驅逐艦、另有更有實效之工作也、聞英法擬用驅逐艦担任地中海防止海盜之巡察、據　海軍巡邏制從未收實在之效果、其唯一工作僅於遇船雙經過而無國際視察員駐船之旗報時、通知不干涉委員會而已、監察制之其餘部分、連監管口岸之需用與國際視察員之登船在內、將仍加維特、英法兩國前雖堅主維持海軍巡邏制、須待英國所提出徹退志願兵並許給交戰團權利之方案業經諸方接受而後已、今忽改變意見、實因地中海海盜問題急迫所致、同時日內瓦今日將簽定尼翁協定之附件、規定救助商船為飛機與水面船雙攻擊者之辦法、此種攻擊如不遵守、各國公認之國際公法及倫敦公約規定之條例則將認為海盜行為、按照倫敦公約規定、攻擊船雙時、須取相當方法保障船員之安全、故一切天空攻擊與水面船雙之種種攻擊、均屬海盜行為、巡察艦遇有此類情事、將卽以處置海盜之法對付之、如施攻之水面船雙較巡察艦力量為大、則巡察艦將請他艦援助、（中央社十七日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］官方人士頃宣稱、英法兩國決定撤銷西班牙海面監察辦法之後、西班牙內亂不干涉政策、并不因而有所變更、蓋海軍監察雖將撤銷、各處港口之監視制度、則仍繼續有效、且監察辦事處主任范特姆關於行施一般監察制度之報吿書、亦將於最近時期內、由不干涉辦法調整委負會加以討論也、抑英法兩國决定撤銷西班牙海面監察之目的、乃在儘最大可能、撤回兩國在西班牙海面担任監察乏驅逐艦而調赴地中海、則以地中海之監察、實較西班牙海岸之監察更為重要也、雖然、英法兩國原來駐在西班牙海面之軍艦、非必須調往地中海以禁止海盜行為者、則仍當留駐西班牙海面、决不因此項决定而一律撤回云、（中央社十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］英法兩國决議將西班牙海濱之海軍監管停止實行、俾將其驅逐艦從事地中海防止海盜運動、意國對於此事極形冷淡、意國視海軍監管之廢止、並無多大關係、因蘇聯戰品之接濟西班牙政府者、始終源源不絕也、（中央社十七日路透電）</p>
<p>［柏林］據政界消息、法英兩國之决議罷行西班牙四周之海軍監管、德國對之殊為冷淡、因德國從未承認此種監管也、（中央社十七日路透電）</p>

<p>昨日報上。披露日本女子的一封書。是敏子與其夫敵機長斧田卯之助者。情意熱烈。辭又愴凉。反戰情緒溢於言表。其言曰“木更津的戰死者委實太多了。十六日以援又在發表了。”又曰“黑崎軍曹逃避戰死的那樣事。希望你具有那樣的神氣”又曰“我一時一刻一分一秒。都在渴望着。期待着。”這樣的書詞。眞是情眞愛至。一字一涙。令人不能卒讀。敏子女士。雖是還期待着斧田的佳音。但是斧田早已作黷武主義的犧牲者了。“可憐無定河邊骨。猶是春閨夢裏人。”我人讀之。凄然欲涙。不知日軍閥讀之。當作若何感想。凡有血氣。俱有天良。清夜自思。能無深悔。</p>

<h3>沉痛的回憶（六）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員叔棣</p>
<p>㊅卑鄙戰略</p>
<p>敵人方面的習慣，一碰到記述他們自己的所謂“皇軍”時，往往就加上“堂堂”這兩個字樣。自從敵人在華北的駐屯軍，大量增加以後，這所謂“皇軍”，給予人們的印𧰼，也就一天一天地，加多了起來，深刻了起來，然而，每一個住在平津的人，祇要他回憶一下對於敵軍的印𧰼，那首先想起來的，大概是這幾項：星期日的時候，全付武裝，成大隊地，開到公共塲所去逛；在街上常常為一大枚兩大枚銅子的爭執，怒吼着，向洋車夫拔出刺刀；一碰到演習後，駕着戰車飛馳過市的時候，那端着槍，怒目而視的姿態，幾乎隨時隨地，要把子彈打進人的胸膛；……等等。然而，在這些印𧰼裏，却絲毫也發現不出近似他們自己所謂的“堂堂”。</p>
<p>敵軍這回在華北和我們二十九軍作戰，一般人都知道，他們武器的精銳，是許多倍於二十九軍的。然而，卽在戰略上，他們也有足述的處所。比如，戰鬥裏，他們的人數，往往超過或至少等於我們方面的部隊，才敢作戰。二十九軍號稱十多萬，然而，總是枝枝節節的應戰；敵人宣稱進攻三十七師了，於是三十八師不動；敵人宣稱進攻的是蘆溝橋，而近在咫尺的北平，還在希圖茍安。說起來，二十九軍人數遠過敵軍，而實際，在每次戰鬥裏，却不見得就比他們多。不用說，這是中了敵人“各個擊破”的戰略。此外，敵人又利用中日關係的畸形，而到處應用着“半眞半假”的卑鄙戰略；明明是通知我方，說是“通過”或“換防”的，然而，看到在某處顯足以擊敗我軍時，那就會立刻停下來襲擊；明明是取着進攻姿態的，然而，一等到近處，看見我軍勢不可侮時，也會立刻換了態度，說是根據條約，開赴某處“換防”；明明先是說“換防”後來變成攻擊，然而，戰到中間，看到形勢不利了，也會忽然老着面皮，說是“雙方衝突，由於誤會”，要求停戰，讓他們通過了。比如彰儀門戰爭那一次，先是日軍要求開門，讓他們進城，開入兵營；後來隊伍進了一半時，忽然對守軍加以襲擊；再後來，經我軍包圍後，又由身任冀察顧問的日人櫻井等，出面制止我軍射擊，而讓他們開進東交民巷的兵營。結果，櫻井是被我軍憤怒地由城墻上摜到街上摔死了；然而，那些被包圍的殘敵，却終於逃脫殲滅，安然放出回營。……總而言之，為了達到戰勝目的，一切卑劣的手段，總不惜採取的。這就是日軍這回在華北作戰的戰略。</p>
<p>其次，敵軍戰鬥情緒的低落，是可驚的。肉搏戰是他們的制命傷，我們軍隊祇要能衝到他們的面前，其意義，就等於他們的潰敗。他們時時刻刻記在心裏的，唯一的秘訣，就是：“遠離華軍，遠離華軍。”在大砲·機槍的射程之內，他們儘可能地遠離着華軍，於是，身子伏在戰壕裏，大砲·機槍·飛機·炸彈，這些，有時超過必要地亂用着，簡直成了浪費。設若，有一連敵軍被圍着，已經消滅了一半，那末，祇要圍他們的中國軍，是超過他們一倍的；這時，這殘餘的敵人，一準會自動繳械，願為俘虜，茍全性命。從前聽說，日本武士道，是每個人愛惜他的武器，超過生命，至死不肯放鬆的；但這回在華北的表現，却是，一到危急，就拿武器去換取生命。同時，因戰鬥情緒低落而起的神經過敏，也發揮到了極端。比如，二十九軍自北平退出後，北平四郊，有少數的冀北保安隊還沒有完全退走，時不時，零零星星地，給敵軍以打擊。這，使敵人麻煩了許多天。一碰到老百姓，就逼着他招出保安隊藏在什麼地方；說“沒有”麼，那末，這又令敵人懷疑到，這個人本身，也許就是保安隊。凡是年輕力壯的，剃着光頭的，穿着汗背心的，穿黃褲子的，………等等，在敵人眼裏，總有很大的保安隊嫌疑。遇到時，略有言語不淸，立刻就加以屠殺，甚至爲萬全起見，連問也不敢問，遠遠地就給以一槍。又比如，八月八號進城以後，住的地方，一共有三處：鐵獅子胡同的綏靖公署舊址，旃檀寺，天壇。這三處，原都是住軍的兵營，構築非常穩固。而况，這時的北平城裏，除敵軍外，誰也沒槍了。然而，敵軍還是不放心的，每到夜晚，步哨要放到二三里路以外的大街，還時時開着機關槍，放着步槍，“像煞有介事”地防着夜襲。諸如此類神經過敏的處所，是非常之多的。而藏在一切底裏的，還祇是“懦怯”。</p>
<p>八號進北平城那天，據所謂“大日本軍北平入城司令”的佈告，入城目的，是“端在襄助維持治安。”然而進城的第一著，就是收繳督察保安隊的槍械，第二著，就是運走二十九軍在平時所存的軍糧，為了提防路上搶刦，還一面運，一面在糧軍後面放槍，第三著，就是把所有重要地方的門口，都換上日軍的崗位，大概到必要時，就把存物運走。故宮是不能搬走的，但那些騰下的古物，恐怕要東渡了。在城外鄉下的時候，每到一處就逼老百姓代找年輕女子，送到軍營裏去，這舉動，在城裏還沒有過，大概因為各國觀瞻所繫的緣故吧，滿載着兵士的小型摩托車，大街上到處皆是。這些車子，速率開得很慢，遇到吃食担子，或小飯舖子之類，往往就停下來，吃點東西再走。吃的時候，先逼着買食品的人，當面吃給他們看，然後，才敢放心地吃下肚去。未吃之前，先問問價錢，一毛不拔而白吃的事，我沒有目覩過；我常常目見到的，却是：一個日兵問價之後，不管三七二十一，就連連搖頭道：“大不便宜！大不便宜！”另一個他的同夥，就硬作主張地豎起指頭，給一個價。自然賣也要賣；不賣也要賣。因為，他們一邊說，一面在摸着槍的。吃後所付的，却是日本票子。</p>
<p>有些人，正在街上走着的時候，忽然有輛日軍的汽車開到面前了。車子裏一聲斷喝，於是，這個人就被強迫着去洗刷汽車。</p>
<p>日人自己所謂“堂堂皇軍”的，其在華北的表現，就是這一類。</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Heavy Rain Made Combat Difficult, Only Minor Engagements on All Fronts</h3>
<p>Enemy's Heavy Armaments Ineffective; Fierce Encounter in Our Counterattack on Yangxing; Enemy Attempted Another Attack on Pudong, Repelled by Our Forces</p>
<p>After a night and day of bloody fighting in villages near Luodian, the stubborn enemy was repelled by our forces. From yesterday afternoon until this morning, there were no major battles due to the rain. Our front line remained stable. In the Liuhang area, the enemy concentrated artillery fire, but our positions suffered no damage. In the Jiangwan-Zhabei area, there were minor skirmishes last night, with clear machine gun and rifle fire, but the enemy was unsuccessful. The enemy's plan to break out of Luodian and attack our Liuhang failed. Currently, enemy ships are concentrating, seemingly reconnoitering Liuhang, Yanglinkou, and Qiyakou. According to confirmed reports, the enemy ships originally anchored in the Songkou area have dispersed and anchored in the river areas of Shidong, Liuhang, Yanglinkou, and Qiyakou, with the largest concentration in Liuhang. The total number of enemy ships anchored in these areas has reached approximately fifty. Enemy ships in Yanglinkou and Qiyakou shelled our riverside positions intermittently throughout yesterday, seemingly as a probe. Our forces were well-prepared and resolved to give the enemy a head-on blow.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a day of torrential rain. Although there were continuous local engagements along the Luodian, Yangxing, and Jiangwan lines, the rain made military operations difficult for both sides, and the scope could not be expanded. The enemy's heavy armaments could not exert their power. The fields were muddy and slippery, rendering the enemy's tanks completely ineffective. Due to the rain, enemy aircraft activity on the front lines was greatly reduced. Yesterday, the enemy could only bombard our positions aimlessly with artillery from the rear, with no other possible activity. All shells landed in the mud and lost their explosive force. Our forces' counterattacks on all lines were temporarily suspended, and there were no changes in the positions.</p>
<h3>Our Counterattack on Yangxing Succeeds, Recapturing Important Villages</h3>
<p>Fierce Artillery Battles Erupted Between Both Sides Yesterday</p>
<p>Our counterattack on Yangxing was quite successful, and we have completely recaptured the important villages on both sides. The vanguard has advanced to the outskirts of Yangxing. Yesterday, the advance was slightly delayed due to the rain. The enemy artillery tried to stop our advance, bombarding our rear positions in Liuhang and Yong'anqiao indiscriminately throughout the day with incessant artillery fire. The artillery fire became even denser in the afternoon, roaring endlessly, and shaking the surrounding areas. Our artillery also returned fire, and the artillery battle subsided slightly towards evening. Last night, a fierce artillery battle erupted again.</p>
<p>After occupying Yangxing, the enemy continued to advance along the highway, attacking Yong'anqiao in an attempt to assault our Liuhang positions. The day before yesterday afternoon, under the cover of our heavy artillery in the rear, we launched a full-scale counterattack against the enemy, advancing simultaneously on both the left and right flanks. The mud and mire after the rain rendered the enemy's tanks useless. Our forces seized the opportunity to advance rapidly eastward, causing heavy casualties to the enemy, who retreated in disarray. Our forces then recaptured the important villages nearby, such as Fengjiazhai, Shenjiazhai, and Xishenjiazhai, one after another, and continued to press towards Yangxing along the highway. By evening, we had advanced to the vicinity of Yangxing. That night, the enemy launched a fierce counterattack against our forces, attempting to recapture the positions. Our forces fought bravely, relying on the strong defenses, and repelled the enemy's repeated assaults. Fierce fighting continued yesterday morning. By noon, the counterattacking enemy began to retreat.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Plan to Attack Liuhang Fails</h3>
<p>Due to the setbacks on the Luodian front and the pressure of our vehicles advancing on Yangxing, the enemy had no choice but to change their strategy, advancing from the central Jiangwan route in an attempt to break through our southeastern positions in that area. The night before last, they concentrated artillery fire, bombarding our Jiangwan positions incessantly throughout the day, attempting to cover their troops' advance. Our forces were well-prepared and heavily defended. Their artillery fire was completely ineffective due to the rain. Our defending troops calmly fought back, and when the enemy approached our positions, machine gunners and grenade launchers suddenly opened fire simultaneously. The enemy was caught off guard, and those who could not escape were sacrificed under the machine guns. Our forces jumped up and swept forward, and the enemy collapsed. Yesterday's heavy rain silenced the fighting along that line.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that the enemy's operational plan for the past two days seemed to be an attempt to break through our southeastern lines in the Jiangwan area, attack Liuhang, and encircle the right flank of our forces in the Luodian area. However, the results were all valiantly repelled by our forces, and the enemy was unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Attack on the Patriotic Women's School Repelled</h3>
<p>The enemy's naval landing force from the Hongkou area, aided by regular army troops, again advanced along Jiangwan Road towards the Patriotic Women's School the night before last under the cover of artillery fire from the enemy naval headquarters and Hongkou Park. This was discovered by our outpost soldiers, who lay in ambush behind defensive structures and waited for them to approach before unleashing a dense barrage of machine gun fire, killing many enemy soldiers. The enemy scattered and lay on the ground, engaging us in a stalemate that lasted all night, but they were ultimately unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Our Forces in Zhabei Launch a Fierce Assault on the Stubborn Enemy</h3>
<p>The night before last, our garrison in Zhabei, taking advantage of the clear skies after the fresh rain and the shining moon, launched a sudden and fierce attack with fresh troops along the line of enemy forces in Hongkou and Zhabei, preemptively. The enemy hid behind defensive structures,不敢出而抵抗, only firing artillery at our North Railway Station and the Zhabei area for a long time. By daybreak yesterday morning, the sky was lightly raining again, and our forces retreated to their original defenses, and the artillery fire also subsided.</p>
<h3>Overnight Artillery Battle in Zhabei and Jiangwan</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) At 1:50 AM yesterday morning, along the line from Datong'an and Baziqiao in Zhabei to Jiangwan, the enemy used heavy artillery to cover a large force of enemy troops attacking our positions. Our air force immediately responded with dense machine gun fire, hand grenades, small steel cannons, and fierce mortar fire, giving them a head-on blow. At the same time, the artillery positions on our ×× side also heavily attacked the enemy's rear with heavy artillery, causing the enemy's positions and ships to feel a major threat from our forces. At that time, an enemy ship docked near the Mitsui Wharf in Pudong was hit by our shells, heavily damaged, and hastily moved away. By about 3:00 AM, the sound of heavy artillery gradually subsided, but the sound of rifles, machine guns, and mortars near the North Station was still extremely fierce, and the battle situation about two miles north of the Huishan and Yulin Road area was particularly intense. However, as a result of our strong defenses, our forces still stood firm on the original front line, while the enemy, due to adopting an offensive posture, suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that at about 1:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy's artillery positions in the Yangshupu area opened fire, bombarding our North Station area. Our artillery immediately returned fire with heavy artillery, and the artillery fire gradually subsided after an hour and a half. Under the cover of artillery fire, enemy infantry attacked our North Station area at midnight, and after a fierce battle until dawn yesterday morning, they were finally repelled by our forces, and the enemy suffered heavy damage.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, there was an artillery battle one mile northwest of the enemy's naval landing force. Several fires broke out near the north side of Hongkou Park, and two fires broke out in the Huishan and Yangshupu areas at about 1:00 PM. A fire also broke out near North Sichuan Road and Bazilu.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attack on Yangshupu Fails</h3>
<p>Our forces in the Yinxiang area retreated to the Huangxing Road line, but the line along the northern boundary of the concession is still being firmly defended. The enemy has repeatedly attacked Huangxing Road and Qimei Road for several days, and after being repelled by our forces, the enemy in Yangshupu launched an attack along the concession line from the evening of the day before yesterday, implementing a central breakthrough tactic in an attempt to cut off the rear of our garrison in that area. Our forces responded calmly, firing machine guns and artillery, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. After a fierce battle all night, the enemy finally could not withstand it and retreated at dawn yesterday (17th).</p>
<h3>Enemy's Attack on Pudong Fails Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>The enemy's attempt to attack Pudong is now becoming more active. At about 1:00 AM yesterday, our garrison discovered several small boats, fully loaded with enemy troops, sailing towards the shore in an attempt to land by surprise. They immediately opened fire with machine guns, and the enemy, realizing that we were prepared, stopped advancing. At that time, the enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River bombarded our positions with artillery, and the rumbling sounds shook the entire city. Our forces stood firm in their positions under the dense artillery fire and did not retreat at all. The enemy boats could not approach, and after a long stalemate, they quietly left.</p>
<h3>An Enemy Aircraft Shot Down By Our Forces</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency, Suzhou, 17th: According to a military officer who returned from the front line, at 2:30 PM on the 16th, three enemy aircraft dropped bombs on our positions between Dachang and Jiangwan. One of the aircraft was hit by our forces, and the fuel tank immediately caught fire. It then crashed into our positions and burned down, and the pilots were also burned to death.</p>
<h3>Enemy Reinforces Arrive With Another 4,000 Troops</h3>
<p>According to reliable information, another part of the enemy army has arrived, about 4,000 men, belonging to the 9th Division. After landing at the Qiujiang Wharf, they were sent to reinforce the western part of the city center.</p>
<h3>Another Giant Enemy Battleship Arrives</h3>
<p>The enemy's large battleship Nagato, with a displacement of 33,300 tons, sailed into the Yangtze River from the Wusongkou Sanxia River surface yesterday morning and anchored near the Liuhang River surface. At the same time, another giant enemy battleship, with a displacement of 27,000 tons, sailed to Shanghai and anchored at the mouth of the Yangtze River. Japan only has eight battleships of this kind, including this one.</p>
<h3>Pudong Attacked By Enemy Aircraft Again</h3>
<p>From 9:00 AM to 12:00 AM yesterday, enemy seaplanes operated recklessly. At 10:20 AM, one aircraft flew to Pudong and dropped bombs a quarter of a mile south of the Kailuan Mining Company Wharf. Twenty minutes later, another aircraft dropped several bombs behind the Anly Yangxing warehouse in Lujiazui. Our forces opened fire with machine guns and cannons. At 10:50 AM, another seaplane flew over Pudong, and our forces immediately opened fire with machine guns and cannons.</p>
<h3>Painful Remembrance of the 6th Anniversary of Today's "September 18th" Incident</h3>
<p>The Whole City Flies Flags at Half-Mast and Holds Anti-Enemy Oaths</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th" Incident, the violent Japanese have forcibly occupied our Northeast. Although we have repeatedly tolerated it, the enemy has become increasingly aggressive, encroaching more and more. Today marks the sixth anniversary. The violent Japanese have further forcibly occupied our North China and disturbed our Central and Southern China, so that our great rivers and mountains are almost always and everywhere under the threat of violence. Our Shanghai area has suffered the most from the trampling of the violent enemy. The Special City Party Department of this city has specially stipulated five memorial methods and notified all sectors of the city. The methods are: ㊀ The whole city flies flags at half-mast, ㊁ All citizens of the city eat vegetarian food for one day and use the saved money to comfort the soldiers, ㊂ Promote "Guangbing" as a substitute for meals, ㊃ Hold anti-enemy oaths, ㊄ Carry out a spiritual national defense movement. Regarding the matter of resisting the enemy and saving the country, it is hoped that the citizens of the city can earnestly implement it, express our national spirit, and declare our determination to resist the war. At this time, when the violent enemy is rampant, and on the sixth anniversary of "September 18th", all Chinese people feel deeply resentful. In order to express their determination to resist the enemy, all sectors of this city will hold a solemn oath ceremony at noon today. The method is to explain the meaning of holding the oath and the method of holding the oath to the citizens of the city by radio at 11:30 AM today. At 11:45 AM, broadcast a record of the party song. At 12:00 noon, all citizens of the city hold the oath. Stores on both sides of the road post paper with the oath. The radios in each store will listen to the oath program from 11:30 AM. When the oath is held at 12:00 noon, pedestrians and vehicles on the road should stop, and other citizens should also stop all their actions, stand upright, first stand in silence for three minutes, and after the silence, raise their right hands to hold the oath. In addition to the guidance of the Boy Scouts along the way, the parents at home, the managers and factory directors or other responsible persons in the stores and factories, and the principals or other teachers in the schools will lead the oath, expressing the determination to unanimously support the government, obey the leaders, sacrifice everything, and resist the war to the end, so as to promote the unified will of our nation.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to commemorate the "September 18th" Incident, clarify the anti-enemy awareness, and commemorate the merits of Qi Jiguang's conquest of the Japanese pirates, this city has specially promoted the making and eating of Guangbing on this day every year, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has notified the guilds of tea food industry, biscuit industry, etc., to prepare a large number of them for needs. I heard that this Guangbing hopes to penetrate into the people, so that every household can make and eat it by themselves, so that their awareness can be more universal. The special announcement of its manufacturing materials is as follows: one catty of flour, five qian of sesame, two liang of sugar, five qian of salt, three qian of lard, three qian of raw oil, a little baking powder. The above amount makes twenty-four pieces, each piece is about three inches in diameter and about two fen thick.</p>
<h3>Rivers and Mountains Change Color</h3>
<h3>Tokyo People's Awakening, Anti-Military Valve Atmosphere Strong</h3>
<p>Intellectuals Attack Important Ministers Military Department; Naval Lieutenant Dies in Air Combat in Shanghai</p>
<p>Tokyo Newsletter, Recently, many pamphlets have been secretly published by Japanese intellectuals. The Gendarmerie Headquarters found "An Exhortation to Respect the Emperor and Punish the Traitors", "Prison Notes", and "A Great Conspiracy of Civic Integration", etc., all of which shielded the contents of the February 26th Incident and guided the relevant people to the beneficiaries, and attacked important ministers and the military department, intending to disrupt military ranks and hinder public security. On August 23, 19 people involved have been arrested and sent to the Prosecutor's Office. These publications have spread all over the country, or posted in train toilets, or written into the army. In short, many of them attack the heads of the military and the veteran ministers, and the situation is quite uncontrollable.</p>
<p>Yazaki Dan, a new Japanese writer, was recently arrested by the police. Yamamoto Kazuo, the editor of the magazine "Hayaza," was also arrested at the same time. According to the statement at the time, Yazaki visited Shanghai this spring and interacted with Chinese left-wing writers such as Wang Tongzhao and Hu Feng. After returning to China, he contacted the Chinese People's Front and tried to make the masses leftist through literature, so he was arrested. Although the superficial reason is like this, in fact, recently, all Japanese people who have interacted with Chinese people are in terror and are planning a major arrest.</p>
<p>Among the Japanese aircraft that threw bombs indiscriminately in Guangde, Shanghai, there was Navy Lieutenant Kami Shikishima, who died in air combat on August 29. This person was a graduate of the 58th term of the Military School and was omnipotent in sports. He was an all-around talent, and he once held a record in track and field competitions, so when the bad news came, many people regretted it. According to the Japanese navy's flying technology, it is originally ordinary, and it is okay to serve as a guard along the coast, but if it is sent out to fight, it is very childish. Although this person is an all-around athlete, his flying skills may not be high.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle of Luodian Town</h3>
<p>The Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses and Has No Strength to Re-Offend; Our Troops Deploy on the Eastern Outskirts of the Town</p>
<p>After our army recovered Luodian Town, the enemy army still wanted to deny it, saying that Luodian was still in the hands of the enemy army, but yesterday when the enemy army entertained Western newspaper reporters, the enemy representative spokesperson told that "the Japanese army is planning to drive our army in the Luodian area out." Isn't our army's recovery of Luodian a self-defeating act and obvious? If our army had not recovered Luodian, why is it necessary to attack our army in the Luodian area? This is what is called wanting to cover it up and make it more obvious.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency said that the focus of the battle for Yunri is on the Luodian line. The enemy has poured all its efforts to commit crimes, and we have fought bravely. The town has been lost and recovered, and Shuli Bridge has been repeatedly contested. There are more than three times a day. The intensity of the battle is no less than that of the Qiujiang Wharf and Baziqiao battles. The enemy suffered heavy losses and temporarily had no strength to re-offend. When the enemy retreated in panic, corpses were scattered all over the field. Our army pursued to the eastern outskirts of the town to deploy defenses, and on the one hand, they were collecting the remains of the enemy army, which were counted to be over a thousand, and two middle-ranking officers were found. The enemy who retreated from Luodian was in a terrible state. When retreating, they burned the villages near Luodian in the north and south, covering their retreat. Our army's left wing advanced to Zhangjiayan and engaged in fierce battles with the enemy near Doujialong. Our army's mortar team launched a powerful attack and destroyed many enemy tanks. The infantry continued to advance under the cover of heavy artillery. The battle on the middle road was also unusually fierce. The enemy at Shuli Bridge attacked our Qianzhai Xiaozhuyuan and other places across the embankment. The fierce battle on the north and south Tangkou has not stopped for two days. Last night's bloody battle in that area was particularly tragic. Our army still firmly held its original position. The enemy who attacked our right wing position in Beizhudian came fiercely. Because the enemy's battle in Luodian was unfavorable, they put all their efforts to attack our Beizhudian in an attempt to contain them. After our army fought bravely, fought bloody battles day and night, and completely defeated the enemy in that area. Several small groups have been annihilated by us.</p>
<h3>News This Morning</h3>
<p>According to the report obtained at midnight, ㊀ Our artillery was unusually active yesterday. The artillery positions in the □□ area and the □□ area separately attacked the enemy positions in Hongkou and Yangxing areas from yesterday afternoon. The enemy suffered heavy damage. Several places in Hongkou were hit by bombs and caught fire. ㊁ There were fierce encounters near Luodian and Yangxing yesterday morning, but the front lines did not change. ㊂ The positions in the Jiangwan area, the western area of Yinxiang Township, and the northern border of the concession were very quiet. Only the sound of sentry guards breaking the silent air in the rain with rifles. Our front line still guards the positions around the Jiangwan Racecourse. ㊃ There were only minor encounters in the Zhabei area, and there were no fierce battles.</p>

<h3>Anti-Enemy Association Propaganda Committee Launches Spiritual National Defense Movement</h3>
<p>All Sectors of the Country Mobilize in Unison</p>
<p>The Propaganda Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Anti-Enemy Support Association, in view of the fact that a strong spirit of resistance is the main condition for grasping the final victory, launched a spiritual national defense movement on the 6th anniversary of September 18th, and asked all sectors of the country to mobilize in unison. The outline telegram and the announcement to the people are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Outline of Spiritual National Defense Movement</p>
<p>1. We only have one doctrine: the Three Principles of the People. 2. We only have one government: the National Government. 3. We only have one leader: Chairman Chiang. 4. We only have one enemy: the Japanese warlords. 5. We only have one highway: resisting the enemy and saving the country. 6. We are willing to sacrifice personal interests to seek national interests. 7. We are willing to sacrifice personal freedom to strive for national freedom. 8. We firmly believe that there is a country before there is a family, and there is a family before there is a self. Therefore, those who want to protect their family must first protect their country. 9. We firmly believe that China can only seek regeneration by self-reliance today, and can only seek liberation by self-determination. 10. We firmly believe that China's resistance has the conditions for certain victory, and the final victory must belong to us. 11. We firmly believe that the war of resistance is not necessarily on the battlefield. Anyone who contributes money and effort, directly or indirectly, to the benefit of the country is a warrior of the war of resistance. 12. We firmly believe that the people's strength is the national strength. The more the people can contribute, the more the country can gain a victory. Therefore, the power of victory or defeat is in our hands. 13. Optimistic world-weary people, pessimistic world-weary people, and shameless Japan-fearing patients are all new forms of traitors. We vow to eliminate them. 14. During the period of resisting the enemy, those who destroy the united front of the entire nation's resistance, we will regard them as traitors and vow not to coexist with them. 15. During the period of resisting the enemy, those who have the strength but do not contribute, and those who have money but do not contribute, we will not recognize them as citizens of the Republic of China and vow to abandon them with the people of the country. 16. During the period of resisting the enemy, if the army of the Republic of China does not participate in the war, or participates but does not strive to fight, we will not recognize it as the army of the Republic of China and vow to abandon it with the people of the country.</p>
<p>Call for Unison to Promote Nationwide</p>
<p>All newspaper offices forward to all national institutions, organizations, and people of all circles for your consideration. The violent Japanese are invading and becoming more aggressive. The scars of September 18th are still there, and the war between China and Shanghai has begun again. The enemy is running rampant, and the rivers and mountains have changed color. The aggressors should be thoroughly punished. However, whether the spiritual consciousness of our national people is sound and correct is the key to the success or failure of the future of the war of resistance. Now that our country's all-out war of resistance has already begun, all of our people should grasp the spiritual victory. We will not easily shake our determination to resist until the enemy bows down and returns our lost land. Everyone identifies the goal, unites their minds, and aligns their steps as soldiers of this spiritual national defense. Then there will be nothing indestructible and no enemy unconquerable. The final victory must belong to us. This is based on the will of the central government, and a kind of spiritual national defense propaganda outline has been formulated. It is hoped that all sectors of the country will mobilize in unison, work hard to implement it, and complete this spiritual armament of the whole people based on this principle. Then the national revival will depend on it. Shanghai All Sectors Anti-Enemy Support Association Propaganda Committee.</p>
<p>Respectfully Inform the People to Work Hard to Implement</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, we have spent every year's September 18th in shame and silence. Although silent, the trembling heartstrings and boiling blood have only increased day by day. This secretly growing force is not permanently silent. When silence reaches a certain decisive stage, it will inevitably erupt. This year's September 18th is a bit different. In the roar of the Chinese nation, the prelude to the all-out war of resistance has been opened. The heroic and tragic performance of our military officers and soldiers and the calm and perseverance of the people have merged into a flood that creates a new history. This flood will make the madmen of aggression capsize completely on leaky boats. We are certain that the final victory must belong to China. Although China's material conditions are not as good as others, its spiritual conditions have been fully demonstrated in both the officers and soldiers and the people over the past month. The firmness and activity of this national spirit has been enough to make the enemy flustered and at a loss. If we further develop and adjust it and build a strong spiritual defense, then the enemy's planes and cannons will lose their effectiveness. The temporary gains and losses of a small-scale strategic advance and retreat can be said to be absolutely irrelevant to the overall situation. In the past, Napoleon's iron cavalry rampaged through Europe, and those who stood in its way were overwhelmed. But the Battle of Waterloo eventually led to the complete annihilation of the army and could not be revived. This is enough to prove that the victory of the war of resistance is not determined by the beginning of the war, but by the progress of the entire national policy and strategy, especially by the weight of the spiritual power of both sides supporting the war. We believe that the collective spirit of resistance of the Chinese nation is great and can destroy the enemy's planes and cannons and will inevitably achieve the final victory. From today onwards, we must establish a spiritual national defense movement, strengthen the national resistance united front in accordance with the published outline, give strong support to the soldiers at the front, and sacrifice everything to dedicate to the country and move forward in the same pace. We will use our advantages to break through the enemy's weaknesses, so that the enemy will finally have to bow to us. The final victory is in our hands. We cannot relax for a moment, history will be changed because of us, and peace will be established by us. China will be a China that is respected and envied by the whole world. We must not abandon or destroy this great mission in the slightest, but to complete this mission, it all depends on us starting from the establishment of "spiritual national defense."</p>
<p>Broadcast Lectures Begin Today</p>
<p>In order to make all the people understand the significance of the spiritual national defense movement, the association has specially hired celebrities to hold broadcast lectures for three days from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM every day. On the 18th, it will be Pan Gongzhan and Tong Xingbai, on the 19th, it will be Tao Baichuan and Liu Zhanen, and on the 20th, it will be Zhang Yousan and Fan Zhongyun. Those who want to understand the future of the war of resistance can listen in.</p>
<h3>Our Troops on the Pinghan Railway Line Fight Stubborn Enemies to the Death</h3>
<p>Halting the Japanese Army's Southward Offensive, Fierce Battles Unfold on Both Left and Right Flanks, Japanese Planes Bomb Baoding for Days</p>
<p>[Beiping] The Chinese troops in North China are currently engaged in a desperate battle to halt the Japanese army's southward offensive along the Pinghan Railway. The Japanese side claims that their left flank, deployed within thirty miles of Tianjin, has made slight progress. However, judging from the situation, the Chinese army's resistance in that area is extremely strong, preventing the Japanese army from achieving its objective of encircling the Chinese forces. The Japanese army is advancing southward along the railway from Genxiang, thirty-five miles southwest of Beiping. Although they have gained some ground, it is minimal. Although the Japanese army claims to have occupied the mountainous area west of Fangshan and the railway, the Chinese army is still holding the hills and villages east of Fangshan. However, the Japanese side claims that after occupying the mountains, they can control the main road behind the hills leading south, thus flanking the Chinese positions at Liulihe. Since Tuesday, the Japanese army has launched fierce battles on both the left and right flanks after taking the offensive on a narrower front, stretching approximately seventy miles from the mountains west of the Pinghan Railway, through Gu'an, to a point thirty miles from Tianjin. Snow has now fallen in Shanxi Province, making the fighting even more difficult. Several thousand fresh Japanese troops recently arrived in Shenyang from Japan, which has aroused considerable surprise. A Japanese military spokesperson here stated that this was to support the Japanese forces in North China. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 17th)</p>

The enemy army is unable to move due to the heavy flooding. On the 15th, they attempted to advance southward along the railway under the cover of armored vehicles and repair the tracks.

Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of our country to the League of Nations General Assembly, immediately stood up and spoke, saying that the brutal Japanese invasion threatened the integrity of Chinese territory and political independence, and asked that wise and effective action be taken to safeguard the peace of all countries. Regarding procedural matters, Ambassador Gu had proposed three possible solutions in his speech to the League of Nations General Assembly on the 15th. The Council's meeting on the 16th has already made a decision. The purpose of Gu's actions is to give the Council full freedom to choose the most effective action within the existing environment.

I haven't received a single letter from you. I really miss you. Are you busy? Whenever I think of you, -in case- a tragic mood immediately overwhelms my heart.

Please give me a letter every day. I am craving and waiting for your good news every moment, every minute, and every second. I hope you have the spirit of Sergeant Kurozaki who escaped death. Yesterday I went to visit Sergeant Tedong's wife. She hasn't returned to Tateyama yet. She is still living in Kisarazu until her husband returns. Axeda, are you healthy? Since you left, mother and the others have been praying to the Bodhisattva every morning for your safety. In this quiet home, especially when you return late, the way I wait for you makes everyone who sees it sad. Please come back soon. May you always be safe. The rest is omitted.

<h3>Settling the Blood Debt of Six Years</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>The sixth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident has arrived.</p>
<p>"September 18th." This tragic "September 18th." This shameful "September 18th." Six years have quietly passed in silent anguish. Every year for the past six years, when this day came, we couldn't even openly and happily commemorate it. Our burning anger could only burn within our hearts. Our sorrowful blood and tears could only flow in secret.</p>
<p>However, today, the situation is completely different. Our great nation of 450 million has roared. Our sacred national war of resistance has unfolded magnificently. In North China, in Central China, our heroic soldiers are fighting the enemy one after another. All our compatriots across the country are determined to resist until the end. For six years, our 50 million compatriots in the Northeast and parts of Hebei and Chahar have suffered enough humiliation from the enemy. Our sovereignty and territory have suffered enough trampling from the enemy. Our culture has suffered enough destruction from the enemy. Today, we will settle the blood debt of these six years with the enemy.</p>
<p>Japanese imperialism's consistent act of aggression has not stopped for a single day in the past six years. From the occupation of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, the fall of Rehe, the establishment of the puppet government in the 22 counties of Eastern Hebei, the "specialization" of North China, the occupation of Fengtai, to the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, all are the results of Japanese imperialist aggression. There is no limit to Japanese imperialism's aggression against our territory.</p>
<p>Moreover, along with the progress of military aggression, Japanese imperialism has also used various vicious methods to attack us. It incited Japanese and Korean ruffians to conduct large-scale smuggling to undermine the lifeline of our economy. It used frustrated politicians and warlords to divide our central government and local authorities. It even set up opium dens throughout North China to poison the Chinese people, in order to eliminate the race of the Chinese nation. Other things, such as the implementation of enslavement education and the establishment of "special service agencies" everywhere, are all vicious plots to destroy China.</p>
<p>This long list of blood debts is now the time for a final reckoning. The 450 million people of China, regardless of class or party, have united like iron under the goal of "resisting the enemy". We will use blood to wash away our shame, to save our 50 million enslaved compatriots, to recover our lost territory, and to fight for the survival of our entire nation.</p>
<p>It's the sixth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident. Our country's history has begun to write the most glorious and brilliant page. The end of the two-month war of resistance has proved that our fighting power is not weak. It has proven that our morale is far better than the enemy. It has proven that international sympathy is on our side. We have greater confidence. We will resist more firmly and persistently. We will not give up until we have recovered all of our lost territory and washed away our shame. This year's "September 18th" is just the starting point of our sacred resistance against the enemy. We believe that by this day next year, we will be able to go to Shenyang to celebrate with our compatriots in the Northeast.</p>

<h3>Japan's Military Build-up Plunges Finance into Crisis</h3>
<p>Military Spending Explodes, Trade Reverses, Outcome Predictable - Commentary from the British Financial Times</p>
<p>[London] The Financial Times commented on Japan's finances and war-making power, saying that Japan's previous adventurous actions and its large expansion of naval, land, and air force spending have greatly weakened Japan's financial structure. However, it would be premature to say that Japan's finances are about to collapse. As for the stability of the Japanese currency, the adverse trend in Japan's trade balance is exacerbated by the war, and the possibility of lowering the currency value is now increasing. The financing of Japan's budget can be considered dangerous. In peacetime, Japan's capital market struggles to meet the needs. It would be difficult to raise the necessary debt without resorting to exhaustion. Japan's belligerence is the result of national cohesion reaching a greater extent. In fact, apart from the economy and finance, Japan is strong in all aspects. Therefore, its war is racing against time. War expenses are by no means inexhaustible, and the method of purely financial inflation has its limits. Moreover, in this time, Japan is not in an impregnable position on the international front. Although Britain and the United States have imposed resistance on Japan, Japan is still able to be self-sufficient, but its supply of raw materials will soon be exhausted. What's more, Soviet intervention is always worrisome. Even if the European situation is uncertain, Soviet intervention may not materialize immediately, but there is always the possibility of it suddenly materializing. If so, the overall outcome of the war is set. In summary, Japan is currently taking this adventurous step with a situation that is more ominous than auspicious. However, we should not easily make predictions, because solid national efforts often quickly achieve success, as recent events have repeatedly shown.

<h3>US Maritime Commission Announces Ban on Transporting Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Ambassador Wang Visits US Authorities, Expresses Dissatisfaction with this Measure</p>

It is generally interpreted that the purpose of this ban is to reduce international disputes to the minimum extent possible and that there is no other intention behind it. As for domestic ships transporting passengers or ordinary goods to China, if they are intercepted by Japanese warships, the US government will certainly not ignore it and has instructed domestic naval authorities in the Far East to protect them at any time.

<h3>Nyon Agreement Signatories Meet</h3>
<p>Text of Annex Awaiting Revision</p>

<h3>Britain and France Decide to Withdraw Naval Patrols off Spain</h3>
<p>Non-Intervention Policy Remains Unchanged - Italy and Germany Remain Cold</p>
<p>[London] Britain and France have decided to discontinue naval patrols around Spain, as the destroyers engaged in this work have other, more effective tasks to perform. It is reported that Britain and France intend to use the destroyers for anti-piracy patrols in the Mediterranean. The naval patrol system has never been truly effective; its only function has been to notify the Non-Intervention Committee when ships pass by without an international observer on board signaling. The remaining aspects of the monitoring system, including port controls and the boarding of ships by international observers, will remain in place. Although Britain and France previously insisted on maintaining naval patrols until their proposal for the withdrawal of volunteers and the granting of belligerent rights had been accepted by all parties, they have now suddenly changed their minds due to the urgency of the Mediterranean piracy problem. Meanwhile, the annex to the Nyon Agreement will be signed in Geneva today, stipulating measures to rescue merchant ships attacked by aircraft or surface vessels. Such attacks, if they do not comply with the generally accepted principles of international law and the regulations of the London Naval Treaty, will be considered acts of piracy. According to the London Naval Treaty, any attack on ships must take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the crew. Therefore, all aerial and surface vessel attacks are considered acts of piracy. If patrol vessels encounter such situations, they will deal with them as they would deal with pirates. If the attacking surface vessels are more powerful than the patrol vessels, the patrol vessels will request assistance from other ships. (Reuters dispatch from the 17th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Official sources have recently stated that the decision by Britain and France to withdraw naval patrols off Spain does not alter the non-intervention policy in the Spanish Civil War. Although naval patrols will be withdrawn, the monitoring system in various ports will remain in effect. Furthermore, the report by Mr. Fantom, the head of the monitoring office, on the implementation of the general monitoring system will be discussed by the Non-Intervention Committee in the near future. The purpose of Britain and France's decision to withdraw naval patrols off Spain is to withdraw, as much as possible, the destroyers from the Spanish coast, where they were engaged in monitoring activities, and deploy them to the Mediterranean, as monitoring in the Mediterranean is more important than monitoring the Spanish coast. However, warships originally stationed off the coast of Spain by Britain and France, which are not required to be transferred to the Mediterranean to prevent piracy, will remain stationed off the Spanish coast and will not be withdrawn en masse as a result of this decision. (Havas dispatch from the 17th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Rome] Britain and France's decision to suspend naval patrols off the coast of Spain in order to use their destroyers for anti-piracy operations in the Mediterranean has been met with extreme indifference by Italy. Italy views the abolition of naval patrols as being of little consequence, as the supply of Soviet war materials to the Spanish government has continued uninterrupted. (Reuters dispatch from the 17th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Berlin] According to political sources, Germany remains indifferent to the decision by Britain and France to discontinue naval patrols around Spain, as Germany has never recognized such patrols. (Reuters dispatch from the 17th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Mediterranean Monitoring Plan</h3>
<p>Italy Insists on Equal Status - No New Proposals Planned</p>
<p>[Rome] According to a responsible spokesperson, after Italy rejected the Nyon plan, it will not propose any new recommendations to halt piracy in the Mediterranean. However, if the major powers allow Italy to occupy an equal position in monitoring operations, it may be possible to reach a compromise with Italy. (Reuters dispatch from the 17th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the Mediterranean monitoring plan, after the Italian government made its demand for equality, it is generally believed that this demand is both a technical issue and a matter of prestige. Italy's intention is to achieve political satisfaction, and the resolution of this issue should be relatively easy. It is reported that Italy's willingness to adopt a compromise attitude is due to the moderate attitude of Berlin. The closing speech given by German leader Hitler at the National Socialist Party Congress in that country was viewed by Italy as aimed at calling on European countries to cooperate with each other. Therefore, the Italian government believes that it is inappropriate to be too hasty at a time when Prime Minister Mussolini is about to visit Germany. The fact that Italy originally intended to explicitly reject the invitation from Britain and France to participate in the Mediterranean Agreement, but later submitted a reply that still left room for discussion, is evident. In short, what Italy seeks is to engage in consultations with Britain to benefit the upcoming British-Italian talks. (Havas dispatch from the 16th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>⊙Bucharest, Romania. Local newspapers recently reported that the Italian shipping company in the Romanian port of Constanța has received orders from the Romanian government not to arbitrarily allow Italian ships to sail to Soviet ports along the Black Sea coast.

<h3>Japan in Contact with Italy and Germany for Far East Cooperation</h3>
<p>Japan and Italy to Sign Trade Agreement Soon</p>
<p>[Geneva] According to sources from the international press corps at the League of Nations Assembly, the trade agreement negotiations between Japan and Italy are nearing completion. Furthermore, according to semi-official sources in Geneva, Japan has suggested that Italy supply Japan with a large amount of military equipment on credit, in exchange for Japan's non-interference in the Abyssinian issue and a guarantee of Italy's interests in China. Other semi-official sources say that Japan is concentrating its envoys to European countries in Germany, hoping to engage in more cooperative contacts with the authorities of the two countries on Far Eastern issues during Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's visit to Germany.

<h3>Extraordinary Security Measures for Italian Prime Minister's Visit to Germany at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Police Authorities of Both Countries Cooperating in All Arrangements</p>
<p>⊙Munich. Authorities, having heard that a large number of anti-fascist Italians have come here from France, have decided to increase security measures for Mussolini's arrival. When Mussolini enters Munich on September 25, rows of stormtroopers will line the streets. (Reuters dispatch from the 17th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Berlin] As Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is scheduled to visit Germany on the 25th of this month, Heinrich Himmler, head of the German political police, is actively making all arrangements in cooperation with representatives sent by the Italian police authorities to protect Mussolini's safety. Suspicious Italian residents will be monitored by the police. The streets along Mussolini's route will be lined with National Socialist Party guards responsible for security, and many plainclothes detectives will secretly monitor the audience. In addition, the German authorities have refurbished the former presidential residence so that Mussolini can stay there. (Havas dispatch from the 16th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>China Will Certainly Win the Long-Term War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Observations of American, Mr. Crow</p>
<p>⊙Seattle. Mr. Crow, a leading advertising figure who has resided in China for 26 years, spoke to reporters today, predicting that China would certainly win the current Sino-Japanese war. Crow stated that China's efforts in resisting Japan could last for at least two years, at which time Japan's morale would be completely crushed, leading to defeat. He said that the fact that the Japanese people have always believed that their army is invincible is a weakness now exposed. Crow also mentioned that he had recently traveled to the Philippines, where Japanese residents also opposed the war. Crow also said that while China's air force has the ability to bomb Tokyo, it is unwilling to do so so as not to undermine China's position in the League of Nations.

We deeply admire your establishment of a city commercial circle promotion team to widely raise National Salvation Bonds. We hope you will continue to promote this widely, so as to gather collective strength and alleviate the national crisis. This is our sincere hope." Ministry of Finance, [Signature]</p>
<p>Ms. Sha Huiying, a depositor at the Postal Savings Bureau, stated that since the government is resisting the enemy in the long term and issuing National Salvation Bonds, all citizens have a responsibility to contribute financially. Yesterday, she specifically used the interest from two savings accounts, totaling 185 yuan, to subscribe to National Salvation Bonds. In addition, all the Chinese staff in the offices of the Oriental Savings Bank in this city, in view of the fact that the invading enemy has desecrated the country and not wanting to be left behind, also jointly subscribed to 115 yuan.</p>
<p>Elderly individuals Xu Jishan, Xu Huiru, and others, who are nearing their seventies, in view of the fact that the violent Japanese are running rampant and the national crisis is severe, entrusted a certain radio station with 100 yuan of national currency, their life savings intended for funeral clothes, and asked Zhang Ye'er to purchase National Salvation Bonds on their behalf. The letter stated that the entertainment industry should publicize this to encourage wealthy people to contribute money to purchase National Salvation Bonds to strengthen national defense and replenish military needs.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Seamen's Navigation Safety Association, organized by the tea room workers of various ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, has always been committed to national salvation work. Now that national resistance has begun, in addition to sending the association's executive director Shao Xubai, clerks Ying Wenhe, Huang Qingfang, etc., to participate in national salvation work, the association's temporary standing committee also resolved to raise National Salvation Bonds starting immediately, with a preliminary target of raising 500 yuan for purchase. They will then find ways to raise more, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Since the National Government issued National Salvation Bonds, various groups in this city have enthusiastically promoted subscriptions, considering it a matter of national salvation, and all sectors have been actively subscribing. The Shanghai Chinese YMCA specifically sent letters to all members yesterday urging them to promote National Salvation Bonds. A committee of 50 members was formed, with Dr. Li Denghui serving as chairman, with a target of 100,000 yuan in national currency, initially for a period of two weeks, scheduled to open on the 21st of this month at noon on the 9th floor of the YMCA.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association, in view of the fact that the violent Japanese are invading and a full-scale war of resistance has begun, and that the government has issued National Salvation Bonds, which everyone should enthusiastically subscribe to in order to alleviate the national crisis, and with a patriotic heart, not wanting to be left behind, decided to hold a board meeting at 4:00 PM today to discuss ways to promote fundraising.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association recently issued a notice to the members of the National Salvation Bonds Promotion Committee: "Greetings. We have received a letter from the Shanghai City Citizens' Promotion Headquarters for National Salvation Bonds, stating that the National Salvation Bond subscription forms have been sent to your office. The methods for using these subscription forms have been discussed with the general headquarters as follows: ㊀ When a promoter is promoting, they only need to collect one copy of the subscription form from the subscriber and forward it to the sub-team to be submitted to the city headquarters. ㊁ The promoter will sign the subscription notification form and give it to the subscriber to bring to the bank when paying, which will then be forwarded to the Promotion Headquarters. We are sending this letter to you, hoping you will follow these instructions. We also heard that the National Salvation Bond promotion sub-team organized by the association has raised more than 160,000 yuan of National Salvation Bonds as of yesterday evening."</p>

<h3>Pang Jingzhou Appeals to Medical and Nursing Colleagues</h3>
<p>To Move to the Rear</p>
<p>Mr. Pang Jingzhou, Secretary-General of the Chinese Red Cross Society, yesterday issued an appeal to all medical and nursing colleagues in Shanghai, saying, "Since the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, our medical and nursing colleagues in Shanghai have not shied away from hard work or danger, and have mobilized separately to establish rescue hospitals and participate in the organization of rescue teams, working tirelessly day and night to provide treatment, demonstrating great kindness. However, since the war zone has expanded and the number of beds cannot keep up, injured officers and soldiers have been transported to the rear, accounting for 60% to 70% of the wounded. Doctors are lacking in various places in the rear, and soldiers are enduring pain while waiting for treatment, which is unbearable to witness. Our medical and nursing colleagues remaining in Shanghai are unable to travel to the rear to personally provide treatment, which is undoubtedly a shared feeling of sadness. The public rescue work on the various lines in North China, especially the Ping-Sui area, is particularly stagnant and has not been promoted, which is undoubtedly a shared sense of regret. At the same time, I know that because negotiations have not been successful, there must be many of our colleagues who are eager to contribute their talents to the war of resistance. Even the number of rescue hospitals is only about half of what it was during the January 28th Incident, and the remaining experienced professionals must be filled with righteous indignation and eager to contribute. As a medical professional, I am obligated to communicate and coordinate with the Red Cross. Therefore, I dare to express my sincere words, hoping that colleagues remaining in Shanghai will quickly rise up and move in a timely manner to the rear hospitals that need doctors or to various places in the rear suitable for setting up wounded soldier hospitals, to take responsibility for treating and caring for the wounded. I will do my best to provide colleagues with various conveniences in terms of personnel contact and coordination with rear hospitals or local rescue committees, as well as the allocation and purchase of medicines, and will discuss this with the Red Cross and the General Administration of Central Rescue Undertakings, in order to fully develop wartime rescue and ensure that talent and resources are fully utilized. The situation is pressing, and the opportunity to serve the country is fleeting. My medical and nursing colleagues, let us rise up!"

As a military officer, Fakui has done little. I am ashamed and grateful for your generous praise. I deeply admire your organization's leaders for rising up to save the country. In addition to conveying your comforting words to the officers and soldiers on the front lines, I also hope for your continued advice and encouragement."

We have received your letter requesting us to create National Salvation Reserve Funds in order to encourage the people to accumulate financial resources for the long term and widely purchase National Salvation Bonds, and instructing us to promote this. We will certainly notify all industries to do their best to promote this. However, Article 2 of the National Salvation Savings Regulations stipulates that all National Salvation Bond payment collection institutions entrusted by this association may serve as National Salvation Savings collection institutions. The intention of this legislation is to universally accept deposits and facilitate savings. Therefore, we specifically request that your association continue to adhere to this intention and extend the National Salvation Savings receiving institutions in this city to the members of the Yinqian (silver and money) associations, so that everywhere is a place for savings and everyone is a saver, sharing the responsibility and obligation of saving the nation.

<h3>Songjiang Red Cross Asks for Free Transportation of Refugees</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Government Has Issued Instructions, Relevant Authorities to Handle</p>
<p>Songjiang Dispatch. The county's Red Cross branch is working extraordinarily hard on wartime rescue work this time, and is making every effort to accommodate refugees. However, the transportation of refugees is particularly difficult. The reason is that there are too many people, making it difficult to get on the train, and all the refugees are poor and have no one to turn to, making it difficult for them to purchase train tickets, and they are afraid of danger along the way. In response, the association telegraphed the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, requesting them to forward the request to the Ministry of Railways to allow refugees to board trains for free from Songjiang Station, so that they can return to their hometowns. The association has now received replies from the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, agreeing to separately instruct the relevant security and transportation authorities to handle the matter. The text of the telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Government is recorded below: "To the Songjiang County Branch of the Red Cross Society, your telegram has been received, your enthusiasm for relief is admirable. Regarding the refugees returning to Zhejiang via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road and via Zhejiang Province, in addition to the Hangzhou Municipal Government presenting and approving the issuance of refugee repatriation certificates to facilitate free transportation, this government has separately instructed the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration and various transportation authorities to handle the matter, and has also instructed the municipal governments of all counties in this province and the Relief Committee of the Provincial Anti-Enemy Support Association to take care of the refugees upon their arrival. Please take note, Zhejiang Provincial Government Chairman Zhu Yin Hui."</p>

<h3>"September 18th" Solemn Commemoration, Our Army's Three-Way Artillery Bombs Enemy Positions</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops Once Rushed Into the Qian Residence But Were Repelled by Us. Our Troops Recaptured the Yangmu Bridge Area. The Enemy Uses Police Dogs to Probe Luodian's Military Situation Every Night.</p>
<p>What day is today? It is the sixth anniversary of the fall of the four northeastern provinces. Old and new sorrows surge to the heart. The violent Japanese forces invaded Lugouqiao again on July 7th, and invaded North China with large forces. Following this, on August 13th, they attacked Shanghai again. Our army fought bravely and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. In order to solemnly commemorate this, our army ordered artillery positions in Zhabei and Pudong to simultaneously fire on enemy positions in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas starting at 6:30 this morning. The artillery fire was deafening, shaking the entire city. The enemy Marine Corps headquarters on North Sichuan Road and its surrounding areas were hit by multiple shells. At around 8:00 a.m., our artillery positions in Jiangwan also bombarded the enemy with heavy artillery. Several places in the enemy positions in Hongkou and Yangshupu were hit and caught fire. The enemy suffered heavy losses. Although the enemy artillery also retaliated, it was aimless and our army suffered no losses. The artillery fire gradually subsided at around 10:00 a.m.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Near Luodian</h3>
<p>Enemy Uses Aircraft and Artillery to Cover Infantry to Launch Fierce Attacks. Once Rushed Into the Qian Residence, But Were Defeated by Our Encirclement and Attack. Enemy Troops Use Police Dogs Every Night to Probe Our Military Situation.</p>
<p>Military authorities received a confirmed report from the front line this morning that after our army completed its defensive positions in the southeast of Luodian at 3:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, the enemy launched a fierce attack on the points of Beizhu Village and Houjia Village starting at 4:00 a.m. At around 8:00 a.m., the enemy sent three more aircraft, along with artillery, to bombard our positions. Our army bravely counterattacked and killed many enemies. Around 9:00 a.m., the enemy planes were repelled and one enemy plane was shot down in the battlefield sky. At 11:00 a.m., the enemy again dispatched multiple aircraft to circle over our positions to assist their infantry and artillery in attacking. After a fierce battle, the enemy was finally repelled. However, starting at dawn this morning, the enemy launched a large-scale attack on our army's positions at Houjia Village, Dongjiang Village, and Xijiang Village. Our army immediately launched a brave counterattack. As of the time of writing, fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Enemy Attacks Qian Residence, Unable to Hold On and Retreats</p>
<p>Starting at dawn the day before yesterday, the enemy used concentrated artillery fire to continuously bombard the area between the north and south Tangkou and Luodian. After noon, the enemy sent ten more tanks to assist in the battle, attempting to use the Zhangjia Village to cover approximately 2,000 of its infantry to attack our Qian residence line. The battle at that time was extremely fierce. The Qian residence position was once rushed into by the enemy. Our troops on the left and right flanks immediately advanced through the blood, encircling and attacking from both sides. The central troops launched a fierce counterattack, and at the same time concentrated flat-shooting small steel guns to continuously fire at the enemy tanks. The enemy finally could not hold on and retreated in a rout. Our army then took advantage of the victory to press forward and recover the Qian residence position.</p>
<p>East and West Su Tang Engaged in Fierce Fighting with the Enemy</p>
<p>At 5:00 a.m. yesterday, part of the enemy suddenly launched a fierce attack on the positions near Gongjia Village and Jin Village and Qian Village. Our army is currently defending the line of East and West Su Tang, Zhoujia Village, and West Ma Village, and is engaged in a stalemate with the enemy. Also, the day before yesterday afternoon, approximately 500 to 600 enemy troops advanced from the east side of Luodian towards our Xiaotangzi position. They were bravely repelled by our army. There is a small river in front of Xiaotangzi. The water in the river has been drained by enemy engineers.</p>
<p>Enemy Uses Police Dogs to Probe Military Situation</p>
<p>Also, according to reports, since yesterday morning, the enemy's attacks on our left flank at Houjia Village have been very fierce. Our army calmly responded to the battle. The enemy was never able to advance. After a fierce battle until about 3:00 p.m., our army changed the left flank position to the line of Huangjia Village, Li Village, and Youmei Village for the purpose of correcting the battle line, confronting the enemy. According to confirmed information, after the enemy withdrew from Luodian, every night for the past few days, more than a dozen enemy police dogs have sneaked into the vicinity of the town to scout out our army's positions.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Recapture Yangmu Bridge Position</h3>
<p>Enemy Concentrates Artillery Fire and Continues Fierce Attack. We Meet the Enemy Head-On, Killing Many</p>
<p>On the Liuhang front, our army has recaptured the positions near Yangmu Bridge (this bridge is between Yongan Bridge and Liuhang) after a vigorous counterattack yesterday. However, the enemy continues to attack. This morning, our army was engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy near Doujia Nong and Mengwan. A stalemate is currently in progress.</p>
<p>After our army recaptured the Yangmu Bridge position, it has expanded northward to the line of Jinjia Bay, Zhang Zhai (according to the map, it seems to be Zhu Zhai), and Chaowang Temple. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy concentrated artillery fire and heavily bombarded the area around Yangmu Bridge and Chaowang Temple. Subsequently, approximately three regiments of infantry attacked us. They were met head-on by our army and killed many enemies.</p>
<p>Yesterday (17th) evening, the enemy launched an artillery attack near Liuhang. Our army also returned artillery fire, and the rumbling sound was endless.</p>
<h3>Fierce Artillery Battle in Zhabei This Morning</h3>
<p>Our Aims Are Accurate, the Enemy Suffers Considerable Losses. Many Shells Hit Near the Enemy Headquarters.</p>
<p>Starting at 6:45 this morning, the enemy Marines in Hongkou and the enemy troops in the city center again launched a fierce artillery barrage at our Zhabei North Railway Station, etc. Our army immediately responded calmly, also using heavy artillery to retaliate. The rumbling sound shook all of Shanghai. Later, our army's artillery fire surpassed the enemy's, and all shots were accurate. Many shells landed on the enemy's Japanese Marine Corps headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road in Hongkou Park and the enemy's positions in the city center, causing the enemy to be unable to withstand it and suffer heavy losses. The two sides fought for about three hours before the enemy was frightened and the artillery fire gradually subsided. At the same time, the enemy troops in Yangxing in the northwest also opened fire on us and were bombarded by our army's return fire. The enemy suffered heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Disrupt Our Army's Rear</h3>
<p>Our Preparations Are Meticulous, and There Are No Losses. An Enemy Plane Was Shot Down and Fell in Dachang</p>
<p>From 6:00 p.m. yesterday to 5:00 a.m. this morning, the enemy troops disrupted the rear of our positions along Baoshan Road in Zhabei. Our preparations were meticulous, and there were no losses. Also, yesterday afternoon, we shot down an enemy plane, which fell near the Dachang position.</p>
<p>From 6:00 p.m. last night to 6:00 a.m. today, a fierce battle took place in the North Station area. The enemy from Jiangwan Road attempted to attack our positions. Our army resisted bravely. The sound of rifles and machine guns did not stop all night. At around 9:00 a.m. this morning, the enemy artillery team near the Bazizhang fired artillery shells at the Macgen Road station area. Our side suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attacks Pudong But Ultimately Fails</h3>
<p>Enemy Small Boats Patrol and Harass But Are Repelled by Us</p>
<p>The Japanese army is still adopting guerrilla tactics against our Pudong positions, and has not taken an active offensive. Last night there was only sporadic artillery fire between the two sides, and several enemy boats patrolled the Pudong surface of the river along the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas. Our army was on strict alert at all ports. When they saw it approaching the Pudong Pudong side, they first strafed it with machine guns, making it extremely difficult for the enemy boats to linger and peek. Therefore, the sound of gunfire continued incessantly throughout the night. At 6:00 a.m. this morning, the Japanese suddenly sent several motorboats, fully loaded with approximately 40 Japanese soldiers, to the Chunjiang Pier, intending to land. They first used machine guns to shoot at the shore. In the sky, a Japanese plane frequently strafed our defending soldiers with machine guns. The enemy ships also fired artillery to show their force. Under the dual pressure of the Japanese navy and air force, our army calmly responded to the battle and used intensive machine guns to resist the various boats. The battle was quite fierce. After more than ten minutes, the enemy boats were unable to approach the shore and could not hold on. They then drove south and charged again towards the Japanese China Cotton Mill pier. Our army had already prepared and gave it a serious blow. The enemy boats then retreated one after another and escaped downstream. The war returned to a state of calm.</p>
<h3>Indian Witnessed Enemy Plane Being Destroyed</h3>
<p>Trucks Carried 1,200 Enemy Corpses</p>
<p>According to an Indian policeman who had just withdrawn from Yangshupu yesterday and was a guard at a Japanese-owned yarn factory, he told reporters that the night before, when our air force flew to the Yangshupu enemy army airfield to bomb it, he witnessed seven enemy planes being hit and destroyed, and more than ten others were damaged and unusable. Later, the damaged planes were dismantled and transported to enemy ships on military vehicles for transportation back to their home country for repairs. Although the enemy wildly fired anti-aircraft guns at the time, our air force was not afraid at all, and finally inflicted heavy damage on the enemy and flew away safely. Their heroic situation was enough to chill the enemy's courage. According to the Indian policeman, when he was about to withdraw, he suddenly saw 40 Japanese military transport trucks, with tents all around. He initially thought they were military supplies carried by the Japanese. Later, he suddenly saw one of them revealing a leg, and then he knew that the 40 trucks were all carrying the corpses of Japanese soldiers, which were collected from the area near the city center after our army withdrew to the first line of defense. It is estimated that the number is about 1,200, counting 30 corpses per truck. From this, one can see a glimpse of the heavy casualties of the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Enemy Detains Civilian Ships for Transportation</h3>
<p>According to a Chinese employee of a certain foreign shipping company this morning, he said that he returned from Songkou yesterday afternoon on official business and saw many civilian-owned wooden fishing boats and iron barges captured by the Japanese along the way, moored off Zhanghuabang and Dinghai Bridge Yangshupu. On the shore of each place, the Japanese were running up and down in a rather chaotic manner, generally preparing to advance towards Pudong.</p>
<p>The enemy troops in the East Shanghai area have been demolishing civilian houses on a large scale in various places in recent days, taking away wooden pillars and planks, and transporting them to Baoshan Road and other places in the city center to build temporary bridges to facilitate the transportation of troops. This kind of atrocity is especially prevalent in Qimei Road, Yinxiang Township, etc. Therefore, almost none of the civilian houses in this area are intact.</p>
<h3>Four Enemy Transport Ships Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, from before dawn to noon today (18th), four enemy transport ships continued to arrive in Shanghai, including ㊀ Ryota Maru (No. 11), fully loaded with gasoline and diesel, berthed at Buoy No. 5; ㊁ Daiichi Unkai Maru (No. 51), fully loaded with military vehicles, tanks, armored vehicles, etc., docked at Osaka Wharf; ㊂ Chitada Maru (No. 59), fully loaded with munitions and ammunition, docked at Huangpu Wharf; ㊃ An unidentified transport ship, fully loaded with approximately 1,000 enemy reinforcements, sailed to China Merchants Central Wharf and landed immediately. The armaments and military supplies of the other ships were being continuously unloaded. There were 40 to 50 enemy soldiers at each pier carrying goods, all transporting the goods into trucks and driving out separately. As for the Ikuta Maru and Chihiro Maru, which sailed to Shanghai yesterday, except that the former had sailed out this morning, the latter and the Daiigo Unkai Maru (No. 166), which sailed to Shanghai four days ago, were berthed at Buoy No. 7 and Buoy No. 5 respectively.</p>
<h3>A Certain Company Commander Talks About the Brave Annihilation of the Enemy at Xishengtang</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops Use Puppet Manchukuo as Vanguard, Eight Melee Battles, Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses</p>
<p>After our army recovered Luodian on the evening of the 15th, all the forward troops on the front line took advantage of the victory and advanced to the Shulibqiao area. Later, because it was too protruding and marching was dangerous, they automatically withdrew to the Nantang Beizhu Village area and held firmly to the dangerous terrain. In recent days, although the enemy has tried their best to attack, they have all been defeated by our army. This morning, the reporter met with a certain company commander of a certain division who had returned injured. According to him, on the 16th, the enemy had attacked along our line more than ten times. He and the soldiers of the unit were ordered to garrison Xisheng Tangkou. At dawn on the 16th, the enemy first bombarded the area with intensive artillery fire, but it was all indiscriminate, so our army calmly defended it and did not move. At about 6:00 a.m., three enemy planes flew from Songkou and reconnoitered our position at extremely low altitude. Our army immediately fired upward with anti-aircraft machine guns. One plane was hit by several bullets and immediately flew high, trying to escape to Songkou, but before long, the plane turned and smoked in the air, caught fire and burned. A few minutes later, the plane's skeleton and the already burned Japanese pilot fell near Xisheng Tang. At that time, the other two planes fled in panic. At about 8:00 a.m., the enemy launched an attack on our army's position under the cover of its intensive artillery fire. Unexpectedly, its vanguard troops were actually puppet Manchukuo soldiers. At that time, our army, because they were seeking peace on the battlefield and were also compatriots, allowed them to return. Who knew that these people were mad to the extreme. Once they reached the rear, they immediately changed their minds and used their weapons to shoot at our vanguard. Fortunately, we were prepared, so we had to endure the pain and execute them. Seeing the vanguard suffer setbacks, the enemy began to attack with regular troops, no less than a thousand of them. Our company soldiers immediately became energetic, and the entire team used their lives. Although enemy artillery shells were as dense as rain, they ignored them and fired all their light and heavy weapons at the enemy formation. The enemy troops could not hold on and retreated, with many killed in battle. Before long, the enemy replenished slightly and returned to attack, but was still bravely repelled by our army. This happened eight times, and they never gained any advantage, but instead suffered huge losses. Enemy corpses littered the four suburbs. To date, the enemy troops dare not go to collect the corpses, fearing being shot by our army. Therefore, the area is filled with a foul smell that makes people want to vomit. Fortunately, our army soldiers all knew how to prevent it and were not affected in any way. Until 4:00 p.m., the enemy had exhausted their plans and dared not attack again. At present, our army on the line is still firmly defending the original place, and has a strong force, prepared for any eventuality. The past two days have been torrential rain. Enemy troops are not accustomed to water warfare, so most of them are hidden in their defensive works. Even if they occasionally come to attack, they are all defeated by us and suffer heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Intense Fighting on the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways</h3>
<p>Fierce battles continue in Dou Dian and Liuli River; Our troops valiantly resist in the Gu'an area; Enemy forces to the left of Yao Guancun are repelled.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to a telegram from the Pinghan Railway front on the evening of the 16th: ㊀ Enemy aircraft and tanks, supported by more than 3,000 infantry, have been fiercely attacking our positions west of Fangshan since the morning of the 15th, engaging in intense day and night battles, with hand-to-hand combat and charges being extremely brutal. Both sides have suffered heavy casualties. ㊁ On the morning of the 16th, more than 20 enemy aircraft, dozens of artillery pieces, and dozens of tanks launched a full-scale attack on a certain unit of our army, with the fighting in the Dou Dian area being particularly fierce. They are still engaged in bloody and arduous battles. ㊂ In the Gu'an area, on the afternoon of the 14th, the enemy broke through a certain unit of our army's position along the Yongding River, attempting to advance on Zhuoxian. They are currently in a standoff with a certain unit of our army along the Daqing River, with a portion of the enemy forces having crossed the Daqing River. ㊃ On the 15th, 50 enemy aircraft bombed various locations, including Liuli River, Zhuoxian, Gaobeidian, Dingxing, and Yixian. On the morning of the 16th, more than 20 aircraft bombed Baoding again. Losses in various areas are currently being investigated. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>[Baoding] In recent days, our forces and the enemy have been engaged in intense day and night battles near Gu'an. In addition to using artillery fire to cover tank assaults, the enemy has also used multiple aircraft to bomb our positions. Our troops are valiantly resisting, advancing in the face of intense artillery fire, and engaging the enemy with machine guns and grenades. Although the enemy has repeatedly attacked our positions, they remain steadfast. Our troops are currently firmly defending the line from Gu'an to Yongqing. Furthermore, the enemy along the Pinghan Railway is also taking the offensive. On the 16th and 17th, fierce battles occurred in the Fangshan to Liuli River area. Enemy aircraft also heavily bombed Liuli River, Songlin Dian, Gaobeidian, and Dingxing. According to news from the railway, employees of the Liuli River station retreated to Zhuoxian on the 17th. Our forces and the enemy are still engaged in fierce battles northwest of Liuli River. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The valiant resistance of the Chinese army in the Gu'an area has made it difficult for the Japanese army to realize its plan to encircle the railway. Furthermore, the Japanese authorities have admitted that one Japanese bomber was shot down by the Chinese army on Tuesday. Moreover, according to a report from the Japanese side in Datong, Chinese aircraft have been spotted over Japanese positions in North China since yesterday morning. Three Chinese aircraft reached Datong. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] At 1:00 PM, several enemy armored vehicles were discovered five or six miles west of the Yao Guancun station. Our army engaged them fiercely, ultimately repelling the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties. There were enemy plainclothes troops north of the Xingji station and an enemy armored vehicle train south of the station. At the time of sending the telegram, enemies were discovered four or five miles north of the Yao Guancun station. Our army is on high alert. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] At 1:00 PM on the 17th, the enemy on the Jinpu Railway again launched an attack on us with armored vehicles. Our army calmly responded, and the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated. At 8:30 PM, the enemy again used armored vehicles to probe our positions. Our army has prepared a strong force to inflict a heavy blow on them. Furthermore, at 3:30 PM, more than 100 enemy troops, carrying armored vehicles and using flat-trajectory guns to bombard us, were discovered in the Li Xinzhuang area to the left of Yao Guancun. After our army bravely engaged them, the enemy suffered heavy losses and fled in disarray. (Central News Agency and Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Blockades the Pearl River</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] Several days ago, the Guangdong provincial authorities sank several old civilian ships in the shallow waters of the Second Beach of the Pearl River to strengthen defenses. Now, the Pearl River from Humen to the Second Beach has been mined. Without the guidance of a government launch, no ships can enter. All shipping companies have received this warning. The British 10,000-ton cruiser HMS Suffolk has been ordered to proceed to Xiamen to replace the destroyer HMS Diamond, which is stationed there. (Central News Agency and Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

The reporter witnessed a total of twelve aircraft passing through the Suzhou station at about 10:00 AM on the 17th. Among them were heavy bombers, fighter planes, and seaplanes, all of which have been disassembled and loaded. They are expected to arrive in Nanjing on the evening of the 17th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japan Dispatches Utaro to Germany for Activities</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Kijuro Shidehara will soon go to the United States as a national envoy. For Germany, which has a pact with Japan to prevent communism, Utaro Tatsuke, the former Minister of Commerce and Industry who knows the national conditions of that country well, has been appointed as a national envoy and is scheduled to depart for Germany in early next month. Utaro Tatsuke said at his Ushigome residence yesterday morning that the Japanese position on the current China Incident must be quickly understood by European and American countries so that they know the true intention of Japan to hope for peace in the East. Fortunately, I am free, so I will privately investigate the situation after the establishment of the anti-communist agreement, and meet with important people from all sides to thoroughly convey Japan's true intentions, regardless of the government.

<h3>Xu Shengjin Succeeds as President of the Henan High Court</h3>
<p>[Kaifeng] Ling Shiyu resigned as President of the Henan High Court, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration appointed Xu Shengjin as his successor. (Central News Agency, 17th)</p>
<h3>Attention to Members of the Friendship Travel Group</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Road Eighth Wounded Soldiers Hospital was founded by the Friendship Travel Group. Now, due to the cool autumn weather, the wounded soldiers urgently need cotton quilts and autumn clothing. It is hoped that all members will generously donate. Because since the outbreak of the war, the addresses of most members are unknown, so this newspaper is entrusted to convey this message.</p>
<h3>Brief Commentary</h3>
<p>— Phase</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper revealed a letter from a Japanese woman, Toshiko, to her husband, enemy aircraft captain Utonosuke Onoda. The emotions are intense, and the words are poignant. The anti-war sentiment overflows. She says, "There are really too many dead in Kisarazu. The reinforcements were announced again on the 16th." She also says, "I hope you have the spirit of Sergeant Kurosaki, who avoided death in battle." And, "I am longing for you and waiting for you every moment, every minute, every second." Such words are truly sincere and loving, a tear in every word, making it impossible to finish reading. Ms. Toshiko is still waiting for good news from Onoda, but Onoda has already become a sacrifice of militarism. "Pitiful are the bones by the shore of the Wuding River, still living in the dreams of the woman in her spring chamber." When we read this, we feel sorrow and want to cry. I wonder what the Japanese warlords think when they read it. All who have blood and breath have a conscience. When you think about it yourself on a quiet night, can you not deeply regret it?</p>
<h3>The Public Unites in Hatred of the Enemy, City Commemorates "September 18th" in Pain</h3>
<p>Today is the 6th anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident. On this occasion of the start of the all-out war of resistance, old and new hatreds have increased our indignation. In order to express their determination to resist the enemy, all sectors of this city will fly flags at half-mast and practice vegetarianism, saving money to comfort the soldiers. At noon, the entire city's residents will hold a solemn and grand oath-taking ceremony to be loyal to the country. Whether indoors or outdoors, all will stand in place, raise their right hands, and read the oath to be loyal to the country and resist the war to the end. When the oath is taken, the Boy Scouts Wartime Service Corps will send members to maintain and guide each section along the way. All traffic, such as trams, buses, and other vehicles of all sizes, will also be temporarily suspended. The solemnity and solemnity is unprecedented. The Shanghai Cultural Circles National Salvation Association, in order to commemorate "September 18th," has united more than 40 groups in the city to organize propaganda teams, mobilizing more than 3,000 people to go to the South City, the First Special Zone, the Second Special Zone, etc., to expand propaganda and promote the Spiritual National Defense Movement. Furthermore, citizens from all walks of life are competing to buy "Guang Bing" as a substitute for mooncakes, either as gifts to relatives and friends, or because tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival on the lunar calendar. Everywhere is filled with a spirit of hatred for the enemy.</p>
<p>The United Christian Church of Shanghai will hold a fast for the country and pray at the Moore Memorial Church on Yuchiang Road today (the 18th) from 12:00 noon to 2:00 PM, and will also offer silent prayers for the wounded soldiers to recover soon. The association will also ring bells to notify all churches in Shanghai and the families of all Christians to hold solemn prayers at the same time.</p>

<h3>Painful Memories (6)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shudi</p>
<p>㊅ Base Strategies</p>
<p>It is customary for the enemy to add the words "majestic" when describing their so-called "Imperial Army". Since the enemy's garrison in North China has increased significantly, the impression that this so-called "Imperial Army" gives people has been increasing day by day, becoming more and more profound. However, as long as anyone living in Tianjin and Beijing recalls the impression of the enemy army, the first things that come to mind are probably these: On Sundays, fully armed, they march in large formations to public places to stroll; on the streets, they often argue over a large or two copper coins, roaring and drawing their bayonets at rickshaw pullers; when driving a tank through the city after an exercise, the posture of holding a gun and glaring fiercely seems to be ready to shoot bullets into people's chests at any time and anywhere; ... and so on. However, in these impressions, there is no resemblance to what they themselves call "majestic."</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the enemy's weapons in this war in North China against our 29th Army are many times more sophisticated than those of the 29th Army. However, even in terms of strategy, they have much to be condemned. For example, in battle, they only dare to fight when their numbers often exceed or at least equal the troops on our side. The 29th Army is said to have more than 100,000 men, but they always fight piecemeal; when the enemy claims to be attacking the 37th Division, the 38th Division does not move; when the enemy claims to be attacking the Lugou Bridge, Beiping, which is close at hand, is still trying to survive. In other words, the 29th Army has far more men than the enemy army, but in fact, in each battle, they are not necessarily more numerous than them. Needless to say, this is a victim of the enemy's "divide and conquer" strategy. In addition, the enemy also takes advantage of the deformed state of Sino-Japanese relations and applies the base strategy of "half-true and half-false" everywhere; it is clearly notifying our side that they are "passing through" or "rotating troops," but when they see that they are sufficient to defeat our army in a certain place, they will immediately stop and attack; they are clearly taking an offensive posture, but when they get close and see that our army is invincible, they will immediately change their attitude and say that they are going to a certain place to "rotate troops" according to the treaty; they clearly said "troop rotation" first and then turned into an attack, but when they see that the situation is unfavorable in the middle of the battle, they will suddenly shamelessly say that "the conflict between the two sides is due to misunderstanding" and demand a ceasefire, letting them pass through. For example, in the Zhangyi Gate War, the Japanese army first demanded to open the gate so that they could enter the city and enter the barracks; later, when half of the troops had entered, they suddenly attacked the garrison; later, after our army surrounded them, Sakurai, a Japanese who served as an advisor to Hebei and Chahar Provinces, came forward to stop our army from shooting and let them enter the barracks in Dongjiaomin Lane. As a result, Sakurai was angrily thrown off the city wall and killed by our army; however, the remaining enemies who were surrounded finally escaped annihilation and were safely released back to the camp. ... In short, in order to achieve the goal of victory, all base means are not spared. This is the strategy of the Japanese army in this war in North China.</p>
<p>Secondly, the low fighting spirit of the enemy army is appalling. Hand-to-hand combat is their fatal wound. As long as our army can rush to their front, it is tantamount to their defeat. The only secret they keep in mind at all times is: "Stay away from the Chinese army, stay away from the Chinese army." Within the range of cannons and machine guns, they stay as far away from the Chinese army as possible. Therefore, they lie in the trenches, and cannons, machine guns, and bombs are used indiscriminately, sometimes excessively, simply becoming a waste. If a company of enemy troops is surrounded and half of them have been annihilated, then as long as the Chinese army surrounding them is more than twice their size, then the remaining enemies will definitely automatically surrender, willing to be prisoners and save their lives. I used to hear that the Japanese samurai code is that everyone cherishes his weapons more than his life and will not let go until death; but this time in North China, the performance is that when in danger, they exchange weapons for their lives. At the same time, the nervousness caused by the low fighting spirit has also reached the extreme. For example, after the 29th Army withdrew from Beiping, a small number of Hebei security teams in the suburbs of Beiping had not completely withdrawn and gave the enemy army blows from time to time. This caused the enemy many days of trouble. When they encounter the common people, they force them to confess where the security team is hiding; if they say "no," then this makes the enemy suspect that this person himself may be the security team. Anyone who is young and strong, has a shaved head, wears a vest, wears yellow pants, etc., in the eyes of the enemy, always has a great suspicion of being a member of the security team. When they encounter someone, if their speech is slightly unclear, they will immediately be killed, and even for the sake of safety, they dare not even ask, and shoot them from afar. For example, after entering the city on August 8, there were three places to live: the former site of the Pacification Commissioner's Office in Tieshizi Hutong, Zhantan Temple, and the Temple of Heaven. These three places were originally army barracks and were very solidly constructed. Moreover, at this time, no one in Beiping City except the enemy army had guns. However, the enemy was still not at ease. Every night, the sentry was placed on the main street two or three miles away, and machine guns and rifles were fired from time to time, "putting on a great show" to prevent night attacks. There are very many places of such nervousness. And hidden under everything is still "cowardice."</p>
<p>According to the proclamation of the so-called "Commander of the Great Japanese Army Entering Beiping City" on the day of entering Beiping City on the 8th, the purpose of entering the city was "to assist in maintaining law and order." However, the first move after entering the city was to collect the firearms of the Supervision and Security Team, the second move was to transport away the military grain stored by the 29th Army in peacetime, and in order to prevent looting on the road, they also fired guns behind the grain army while transporting it, and the third move was to replace all the entrances of important places with Japanese soldiers, probably to transport away the stored items when necessary. The Forbidden City cannot be moved away, but those vacated antiquities are probably going to be shipped to Japan. When in the countryside outside the city, every time they go to a place, they force the common people to find young women to send to the barracks. This action has not happened in the city, probably because it is related to the views of various countries. Small motorcycles full of soldiers are everywhere on the streets. These vehicles drive very slowly, and often stop when they encounter food stalls or small restaurants to eat something before leaving. When eating, they first force the people who buy food to eat it in front of them, and then they dare to eat it with peace of mind. I have never witnessed the matter of eating for free without paying a penny after asking the price; what I have often witnessed is: after a Japanese soldier asks the price, regardless of three or seven twenty-one, he repeatedly shakes his head and says: "Too expensive! Too expensive!" Another of his companions will forcefully give a price. Naturally, the seller has to sell; if they don't sell, they have to sell. Because they are touching their guns while talking. What is paid after eating is Japanese banknotes.</p>
<p>Some people are walking on the street when suddenly a Japanese military car drives up in front of them. A shout comes from the car, and then this person is forced to wash the car.</p>
<p>What the Japanese themselves call the "majestic Imperial Army" is like this in North China.</p>
<h3>The Atrocity of the Enemy's Occupation of Dongsha Island</h3>
<p>Planning to Reconstruct a Seaplane Base; People on the Island Suffered Massacre by the Enemy Army</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that the Hong Kong Morning Post on September 7 reported in detail the occupation of Dongsha Island by Japanese warships. The following is a transcript: Dongsha Island has a marine product company managed by George Ping, who has been engaged in the island's marine products for many years. This morning, the company's staff arrived in Hong Kong from the island, bringing shocking news and news of the brutality of the Japanese Navy. The staff of the lighthouse and the marine product company were subjected to torture, and at least three people are missing, and it is now believed that they have all died. The No. 1 staff member of the marine product company understands some Japanese, so what he said is particularly moving. The occupiers of Dongsha Island were two Japanese destroyers that had participated in the attack on Xiamen. They carried more than 20 corpses of sailors to the island for cremation, and transported about 500 boxes of gasoline to the island. According to the tone of the Japanese soldiers, they plan to establish an aircraft base on the island. After the staff of the marine product company were released and left the island by speedboat, they saw the two destroyers also heading towards Shantou, leaving some sailors, carrying machine guns and anti-aircraft guns, stationed on the island to defend. According to the No. 1 staff member this morning, the incident occurred on Friday morning. A Japanese destroyer sailed to the side of the island, and dispatched a large team of sailors carrying two machine guns and two anti-aircraft guns to land. First, they surrounded the radio station and forced the people in the station to open the door. After entering the house, without any reason, they overturned and destroyed the bedding, chairs, tables, etc., and tore down the tents. After the destruction work was completed, they drove the lighthouse staff to the outdoors and ordered them to kneel in the open space, pointing machine guns at them. At that time, everyone was terrified, thinking that death was imminent. At the same time, a team of sailors went to the marine product company and arrested the staff and made them kneel in the same place as the lighthouse staff. Then, they ordered everyone to report their names, and then drove them into the lighthouse and closed them in a small room. The other rooms were occupied by Japanese sailors. The next morning, the Japanese destroyer captain formally occupied the island. At noon, he accused the lighthouse staff of hiding military materials without reporting. The lighthouse chief, Mr. Li, was still taken to the outdoors because he did not explain where the military materials were hidden. A knife was tied to the top of his head with a towel, and a strong sailor stood behind him with an iron hammer. If Mr. Li's answer was not satisfactory, the hammer would fall and the knife would sink into his head. Two other sailors stood on the left and right with bayonets. A Japanese officer would punch Mr. Li from time to time. As for the result of the torture, I can't know it because it was my turn. The Japanese officer asked me where George Ping was. According to the Japanese, they knew he lived on the island, but in fact, he had left the island on the 31st after carrying the lighthouse shift change people there. The Japanese officer said that George Ping had previously mistreated Japanese fishermen who came to the island from time to time. If he was caught, he would be shot. I told him that George Ping had already left the island, and the Japanese captain accused me of lying and punched me, and tied a knife to my head like the lighthouse chief. I thought my life was over when the sailor behind me raised the iron hammer. When I told him George Ping's address in Hong Kong, I was spared. At 10:00 pm, I thought my death was coming, because they took me out again to ask about the mistreatment of Japanese fishermen, and after asking, they drove the people who were detained to the open space again, and ordered them to kneel in front of the machine guns as before. We were all shivering. We were threatened like this several times during the night. We all thought that our nerves would be destroyed by morning. The next morning, the Japanese ordered the lighthouse staff to take off their uniforms and board the destroyer with us in a speedboat. Another destroyer patrolled around the island. The lighthouse staff were members of the Navy, so they were regarded as prisoners of war and detained. We were ordered to leave the island in a small speedboat to Hong Kong. There were four speedboats on the island, and they were all destroyed. The Japanese only allowed us to carry five cans of gasoline, so the quantity was not enough to drive to Hong Kong, so we asked for more. Fortunately, they gave us fifteen more cans. We then set off against the waves. We had only left the island a few hundred yards when we heard heavy gunfire behind us. Fortunately, the naval gunners were not good at aiming, so no shells fell near the boat. The Japanese had let us go, but wanted to kill us at sea. I understand some Japanese, and I heard the Japanese on the island say that they plan to turn Dongsha Island into a seaplane base, so they forced us to help transport 500 boxes of aircraft oil to the island. We encountered a storm on the way, but because it was a tailwind, we arrived in Hong Kong in 41 hours. When we entered British waters, our joy was indescribable.</p>
<h3>Problems with Remitting Checks for Donations and Taxes</h3>
<p>The Taxpayers Association Sends a Letter to the Public Works Bureau to Accept Them; The Tax Bureau Must Collect Checks That Can Be Cashed</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Taxpayers Association of Chinese in the Public Concession sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Bureau yesterday, saying: "We are writing to you because we have received a letter from taxpayer Gu Bohua, saying, "When paying the general donation to the Public Works Bureau, I paid a check remitted from the Bank of China, but unexpectedly, it was rejected, and I was told that I had to pay in cash. At a time of crisis, it is necessary to stabilize the financial system to maintain public order, but the Bureau has such a practice, which is regrettable. Therefore, I am writing to you in particular, hoping that your Association will make every effort to negotiate." The Association has examined the situation of Shanghai and the current financial situation. Your Bureau should be fully aware of this. Taxpayers in Hongkou have lost their due protection, resulting in sacrifices of life and property, and your Bureau has lost a large amount of income. Mr. Gu assisted your Bureau and paid the donation as required, but the payment was rejected. This is a case of "seeing the tip of an autumn hair but not seeing a cartload of firewood." If the tax collector deliberately makes things difficult, he should be disciplined; otherwise, if the remittance is not accepted and the cash is not available, the result will not be difficult to imagine. We are writing to ask you to investigate, recognize the facts, and accept the good intentions of assistance." The Association also replied to Mr. Xian, saying, "We have received your letter of the 14th. According to the order of the Ministry of Finance, the general donation to the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession should be paid with a remittance check. The Bureau's refusal to accept it is the fault of the Bureau in delaying payment. We have sent a letter to negotiate." A reporter from the New Voice News Agency asked the Tax Bureau yesterday about the issue of paying taxes with checks. According to the Bureau, "Our Bureau collects national taxes in accordance with the order of the Ministry, which should be limited to legal tender and instruments that can be exchanged for legal tender. Remittance instruments are not applicable. The bank has not complied with the order to stamp and certify the checks paid by the Greater China Company for tax payments. The Bureau cannot accept it if it only allows remittances. Moreover, the request of the Hubei Provincial Government to allow merchants to pay taxes with checks has been reviewed by the Ministry, which still requires them to follow the method of filling out an application form, and does not allow them to pay taxes with remittances. Therefore, our Bureau collects all instruments that can be exchanged for legal tender for tax payments, and there is no order to pay in cash."</p>
<h3>The Beijing-Shanghai Highway is Unobstructed</h3>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reports that the Shanghai-based manager's office of the Studebaker automobile company sent a new ambulance to the capital, handing it over to the police department. It arrived safely on September 12th. The car carried three passengers: Mr. Pei Shu, the director of the Lu'an Christian Hospital in Anhui; Mr. McDaniel and his wife, reporters from the Associated Press. The car departed Shanghai at 5:00 PM last Sunday and arrived in Beijing at 6:00 PM the following afternoon, taking thirteen hours. According to a letter from Mr. Pei Shu, the condition of the highway to Beijing is very good. They only encountered eight Japanese aircraft once during the journey, four heavy bombers and four fighter planes. They immediately stopped the car, and the three people took refuge in a mulberry forest beside the road. Other than that, the journey was unobstructed. They only stopped briefly at three locations to have their passes inspected. Although there is a constant threat of bombing by Japanese aircraft on the Beijing-Shanghai highway, many vehicles still travel along it during the day. Mr. Pei Shu encountered many buses and at least thirty private cars along the way, as well as several postal vehicles heading towards Shanghai. The mail between Beijing and Shanghai is currently being transported by three high-speed cargo trucks. After arriving in Beijing, Mr. Pei Shu plans to take a train to Hefei, as the hospital affairs there urgently require his attention.</p>
<h3>The Last Stand of Japanese Militarists: Farmers' Anti-War Sentiment</h3>
<p>Rural Collapse Crisis Exposed in Japan</p>
<p>According to an agricultural expert who recently returned from Japan, speaking to a reporter from the National News Agency, anti-war sentiment is extremely strong among the Japanese people, especially among farmers. The collapse of Japanese rural areas is also becoming increasingly evident. The main reason for the collapse of Japanese rural areas is the low value of Japanese agricultural products, while agricultural supplies have increased. Recently, due to the increase in the budget, taxes have increased, and farmers are overwhelmed by the burden of suffering. At the same time, there is still a major crisis in Japanese rural areas. Because Japan has a large population and little land, in order to increase agricultural products to meet the needs of the people, it has to apply extremely high fertilizers to the land, making Japanese fields the country with the highest fertilizer use in the world. However, Japan is also the country with the greatest shortage of fertilizers in the world. All the fertilizers needed are supplied from abroad, but now the price of fertilizers has increased dramatically, and the sources are even fewer, so farmers are crying bitterly. As a result, anti-war sentiment is becoming more serious.</p>
<h3>Various Charity Organizations Solicit Winter Clothing for Refugees</h3>
<p>Please Donate Quickly to Benefit the Disaster Victims</p>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Committee believes that as the weather gradually turns cold, the problem of refugees' clothing and bedding urgently needs relief. It is reported that it has entrusted the Women's Movement Promotion Association to handle it. It is understood that the staff of the Association's Comfort Group have already set off on the 14th to complete the investigation of various shelters. They need 8,000 cotton quilts, 12,000 sets of children's clothes and trousers, and 12,000 pairs of shoes and socks. For the sake of the refugees keeping warm, the Association has distributed more than 2,000 pieces of clothing and hundreds of pairs of shoes that it has stored on the 15th and 16th. There is still a shortage of 8,000 cotton quilts, 10,000 pieces of clothing, and thousands of pairs of shoes and socks. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically donate to benefit the disaster victims. If people from all walks of life donate the above-mentioned clothing, shoes and socks, please send them directly to the Shanghai Relief Committee, Pudong Building, Chengdu Road, Rue Massenet, or the Women's Movement Promotion Association, Room 410, Pudong Building.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association has established a total of 50 refugee shelters, accommodating more than 100,000 refugees. In addition to trying to send them away every day, there are still more than 30,000 refugees. The daily expenses are very high, and the funding is difficult to raise. The Nanjing Relief Committee remitted 10,000 yuan yesterday to be used for the relief of refugees in the war zone. However, the war zone is expanding day by day, and a drop in the bucket is far from enough. It is still hoped that philanthropists from all over the country will generously donate money, or donate food, or donate clothing, or assist with medicine. If you are willing to donate, please hand it over to the Accounting Office of the Association in Renji Hall, No. 6 Ma Road, and a receipt will be issued immediately, and it will be published in the newspaper to promote benevolence.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the three counties of Taicang, Jiading and Baoshan have been the first to bear the brunt, especially Baoshan County, which has become a scorched earth. The total number of refugees in these three counties has reached more than 900,000. Because they fled in a hurry, the refugees' relief association organized by the people of the three counties in Shanghai rescued them from danger, and Shanghai charity organizations helped to set up shelters. However, as the weather is getting colder, they lack equipment to protect themselves, resulting in widespread illness these days. The Association has limited financial resources and cannot make its own, so it specifically requests all sectors to generously donate old winter cotton clothing and bedding to distribute to refugees. If you are willing to donate, please send it to Room 103, 2nd Floor, No. 12 Avenue de la Republique, French Concession (telephone number 85821) or notify by telephone so that staff can be sent to collect it.</p>
<p>The Young Women's Christian Association at No. 999 Bubbling Well Road, in memory of the soldiers who shed blood in the trenches to resist the enemy and defend the country, and the refugees who have lost their families and are unable to cover their bodies with clothes, the cold wind is piercing and the cold air is invading, it is really difficult to cope with. Therefore, the silk cotton vests, flannel vests, and old winter clothes made will be sent to the local associations to be forwarded to the soldiers at the front, and the cotton-padded clothes received will be distributed to the refugee shelters. Now, it is specially soliciting cotton quilts and cotton clothes from women from all walks of life so that they can be forwarded continuously so that the wounded soldiers and refugees will not be troubled by the cold. It is especially welcome to donate silk cotton vest clothing materials and cotton silk cotton. In addition, women from all walks of life can register with the Association and are willing to provide voluntary services (or slightly subsidized) to hospitals, refugee shelters, and agencies. There are many talents. If you need to hire them, please contact the Association or call 349.</p>
<h3>The Performing Arts Salvation Association Will Hold a Grand Gathering</h3>
<p>Ticket Revenue Will Be Used to Relieve Members</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Shanghai Performing Arts Salvation Association, it launched fundraising for national salvation donations. It has raised more than 10,000 gold yuan in two times, all of which have been remitted to the Military Commission or sent to the Shanghai All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, the designated bank for collecting donations. A part of the donations was used to purchase comfort items according to the donors' wishes, and it has also been sent to the Shanghai Office of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters for verification and transfer.

The Performing Arts Salvation Association specially raised more than 500 gold yuan to purchase 30 dan of rice, and distributed four liters of white rice to each member to meet the current emergency. It is also scheduled to hold a grand gathering of the performing arts community at the Oriental Book Market on the 21st of this month. The ticket revenue will be used as a relief fund for members.
