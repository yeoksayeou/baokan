<p>今天有幾件事、向大家報告、卽我們現在得到匪偽師長張復棠（卽張萬慶）的“命令”一紙、係奉商都第一軍部轉奉田中機關長電令、其中主要兩條如下、一、田中機關長絕對信賴貴官、（卽指張萬慶）總查中國之狀態、係我等有發展之機會、决無可慮之處、有小官（小官卽田中自稱）指示之方針、努力為要、二、中國全局之大事、要使部下澈底明瞭、尤其西安事件、更得對部下説明、要奮勉之、并有大成功之可能等語、我們讀完了匪方這一道命令、應當要想我們國內之紛亂、適為敵人奮進之機會、敵人藉我自相擾亂秩序不安、拿來去奮勉他的軍隊、在過去我國多少次的事變、皆為造成敵人伸手的好機會、亦卽為造成敵人侵略我土地與主權的機會、現在我們由國人應該覺悟、就是敵來侵略我、是我們先給敵人造下了機會、並非敵人完全靠他的力量、設如我不給敵人造機會、敵人决不敢輕易來侵略我、目前吾人應澈底覺悟、勿再予敵人以侵略機會、那麼敵人便無法、也不能來侵略我們了、當綏遠抗戰開始之際、我全綏軍民各界、精神上完全一致、故能應付此次事變、但是在當時有極少數智識份子、他們的見解另一樣、他們説我們綏遠各項準備、樣樣不如人、乃不謀和平解决的辦法、而講抵抗、結果非使地方糜亂不可、這樣説法、在當時亦不能認為大錯、因為估計敵我力量、我實無操勝算之把握、不過我以為今天的中國人、應當下决心、不以利害來决定我們的行動、而應以犧牲精神來博取最後的勝利、我們處於國難嚴重的今日、要作救亡圖存的工作、物質不足為我們主要的條件、我們要拿“人心”與“精神”去戰勝一切、在抗戰之先、我們不能預料必勝、但我們人人都有不作亡國奴的决心在心頭、乃能不顧一切與敵作殊死戰、我們與敵作戰、雖沒打勝仗的把握、但不作亡國奴這把握、却全在我國必自亡而後人亡之、歷史告訴我們是絲亳不爽、對於此次整個戰事、我們不談、現在只説紅格爾圖一戰、紅格爾圖之戰、係於去年十一月十五日開始、紅格爾圖離陶林一百六十里、離平地泉一百八十里、離敵人根據地不過六十里、是一個很小的地方、我國駐在那裏的兵力、不過騎兵兩連、人數二百餘人、由張團附負責担任警戒、同時那裏的工事、十分簡陋、而敵忽於二十五日向我陣地猛攻、我們都曉得騎兵只能活動遊擊、不能守、守亦不成功、况在當時、我方電綫也被敵割斷、消息於是不通、敵人兵力當有五千至七千人、而我只有二百人、與之相較、正差幾十倍、同時敵方有大砲飛機助戰、而我只有來福槍、苟在當時如以利害計較、如顧到物質條件、那我們决不能勝、紅格爾圖亦决不能守、但是結果勝利反屬於我、故紅格爾圖之戰、為此次戰事之最有價值的戰爭、也就是我們的犧牲精神得到了勝利、在當時該團附所受的使命、是警戒、并非死守、但他能作到如此成績、是他的精神力量、故有此收獲、我們復興民族、須在此種精神中求之、由以上證明我們如果不給敵人造機會、不畏懼敵人、同時人人不甘心作亡國奴、抱定國可亡而我决不作亡國奴的决心、這樣戰勝敵人、我們雖沒有把握、但不作亡國奴、却人人有此把握、以犧牲的精神、去對抗敵人、我們必能勝利、因為吾人的鮮血、可以勝過敵人的飛機大砲、吾人大無畏的精神、可以戰勝敵人的物質、如此敵人决不能來亡我、所以我相信中華民族不能復興、但是我們必須要、一、不自亂陣容、不自行分裂、二、不苟安、要發奮圖强、三、不畏敵、不自餒、以犧牲的精神去戰勝一切、希望大家把我們的體力和智力、完全貢獻於國家、共同努力、完成復興使命、（中央社二日電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本林內閣成立</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>日本宇垣大將自從上月二十四日拜會組閣以後。經過五日的奮鬥終因軍部方面的堅决反對。不肯推薦繼任陸相。而告失敗。於二十九日進宮拜辭組閣大命宇垣辭職後。西園寺公本擬推薦平沼組閣。但自得知軍部對於平沼的反對並不亞於宇垣後。卽推薦林銑十郎大將組閣。由日皇於二十九日深夜下命。林大將受命後卽開始組閣。與各方經過數次的接洽。卽於一日組成新閣。而於二日正式就職。於是經過十數天之久的閣潮就平靜下去了。</p>
<p>新成立的林內閣。無論從那一方面來説。都是在軍部的勢力影響之下先就林大將本人説。他根本是一個軍人。過去曾任陸相及朝鮮總督等要職。而在朝鮮總督任內。適因九一八事變橫生。就擅將軍隊開入東三省境內。以為關東軍的後援。這次担任組閣後。軍部方面就予以極力的支持。不過對於陸海相的候選人。林大將却與軍部方面的意見稍有不同。林大將擬以板垣及末次二氏分別充任。但前任陸海相則分別推薦中村及米內。結果自然是林大將讓步。同時軍部所提出的條件。林大將也全部接受。陸軍所提出的條件是。㊀完全承認陸軍省關於實施國防預算及增加連續六年之陸軍費用的要求。㊁儘早實行革新政策及前任陸相主張實行的其他政策。海軍所提出的入閣條件。主要的有二。第一為無絛約狀態下第一年之軍備擴充根本方針。與急迫之第三次補充計劃預算。須迅速圓滑實施。第二為外交一元化。其中尤以對華外交之根本方針。須從新再加檢討。這些條件都為林大將所一一接受了。</p>
<p>從林大將的組閣經過説。新閣固然是全在軍部勢力的影響下。而從新閣的組織性質説。更可見其業已實行軍部方面的一貫主張。我們知道在前任內閣時期中。軍部卽要求革新行政機構。而在這次新閣中。除了三四部外。其餘各部多為兼任。如林總理之兼任外務及文部。藏相結誠豐太郎之兼任拓務。農相山崎達之輔之兼任遞信部。鐵相伍堂卓雄之兼任商工部。這種情形不啻是實行軍部革新行政機構要求的初步表現。</p>
<p>新閣旣然是全在軍部的控制下。則其將來所行的政策自然也唯軍部之命是聽。在對內方面。新閣的統制主義必更加緊。其對於自由主義的壓迫。與對於一般大衆的經濟榨取以便盡量擴充軍備在對外方面。大陸政策的厲行。當然是不必説。駐美大使齋藤博的被任為外相。一方面雖想藉此打開日本自德日反共協定締訂後所引起的國際孤立局面。但在另一方面却也想加緊其對華的吞併政策。因為齋籐博。雖在歐美担任外交官多年。而其對於侵吞中國的意見郤與軍部方面完全一致。我們當還記得“四一七”天羽聲明書發表時。歐美方面曾起極大的反響。而這位新任外相却多方辯護。簡直不把中國當做一個國家。</p>
<p>林內閣雖在軍部的支持下順利組成了。但它的前途如何郤還不能十分樂觀。因為其在國內外的所將引起的嚴重反響。尤其是中國的國策是於林內閣的命運有重大的關係的。</p>

<h3>林內閣正式就職閣員寥寥八人</h3>
<p>且各同牀異夢前途多難　政友會民政黨拒絕參加</p>
<p>［東京］林大將今晨九時半入宮覲見日皇、捧呈閣員名單、由御前退出、旋因日皇卽日舉行親任式、林大將與其他閣員均着禮服進宮、日皇着普通禮服、於十時二十五分親臨鳳凰室、永野海相侍立、日皇賜勅語親任陸軍大將林銑十郎為內閣總理大臣、兼外務大臣、文部大臣、由永野海相授以官記、旋於十一時半、由林首相侍立、舉行各閣員之親任式、於是林內閣正式成立、（二日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］林內閣之特異性頗堪注目者、大致如左、</p>
<p>㊀首相兼攝外相與文相、且各省大臣亦多兼職、閣員全部僅八人、</p>
<p>㊁政友會之中烏知久平與民政黨之水井柳太郎、均已拒絕入閣、故與政民兩黨完全處於絕緣狀態、</p>
<p>㊂銓衡繼任陸相時放棄最初之組閣方針、以致基準革新派之代表人物、十河信二中途退陣、方能完成組閣、</p>
<p>㊃因此新內閣之政綱政策、亦不過羅列極其平凡之文字而已、其本質與齋藤·岡田·廣田等三內閣、並無任何變更、甯可謂為較諸廣田內閣、其革新意識、尚覺後退一步、且林內閣對軍部之關係與對政黨關係、實已包藏多數禍根、於將來更堪注目者也、</p>
<p>至於推薦陸相問題、將來遇事必增其內部糾紛之程度、對政黨關係、現今雖被解散空氣所脅迫、若竟至難免解散之程度、則政黨必决心採取反攻態度、當為意料所及之情形、而此時與政民兩黨完全絕緣之林內閣、究將採以若何態度、頗難豫擬、一部分人士則謂、或將向政民兩黨設法工作、而計畫樹立新政黨、但政黨對於毫無黨員閣僚之現內閣、究肯為之盡力組織機關黨否、亦屬非常之疑問、又因閣員人數甚少、故閣內之統制、比較容易、維觀其閣員名單、則一見而知其為烏合、缺乏中心之集體、若認為處理現今重大難局之內閣、則不無缺乏魄力之嫌、是以一般人士均豫料其難免短命之厄云、（二日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］林首相二日午后二時在首相官邸會見記者團、發表談話云、不肖此次奉命組閣、際此非常時局、欲安定民心、發展國力、須非常之決心、余當竭盡棉薄、以報國家、幸望諸君、不惜與以援助云、（二日同盟電）</p>
<h3>當前難題種種</h3>
<p>應付議會與修正預算　大橋與兩院議長折衝</p>
<p>［東京］新藏相結城豐太郎昨晚由組閣本部返自宅後、對記者曰、黨員入閣問題、今晚可解决、其脫離政黨並非必要條件、係其本人意志之問題、新內閣希望政黨援助應否解散議會問題、為親任式完舉後應决定者、假使議會不解散、曾於廣田內閣時提出之預算案、由議會撤回、而由新內閣再提出議會、其時是否修改、將於舉行親任式後可决、（二日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］林內閣成立後、議會是否解散問題、為各方注目之的、然現政府以政民兩黨不獨未積極表示反對內閣、毋甯表示將以是是非非主義、使預算案成立之態度、故最初不以解散方針應付議會、視議塲之情勢、再講臨機應變之措置、惟結城新藏相對馬塲前藏相之財政經濟政策、將加以幾分之修正、故議會有暫時停會、乃至休會之必要、大橋書記官長二日午後、與貴衆兩院書記官長協議甚久、大體三日縱令議會再開、政府並不奏請停會、將依貴衆兩院各派交涉會之决定、繼續休會、已由貴衆兩院書記官長向兩院要求諒解、其休會期間、預定從三日起、約十日間云、（二日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］林內閣之出現、與第七十次議會之卽時解散問題、現為政界各方面最關心之重大事件、又因其結果如何、為决定將來政局之重要關鍵、頗惹起一般人之注意、米內光政就任海相時、提出其入閣絛件、而關於無條約第一年以後擴張軍備根本方針、尤其第三次補充計劃之實施、已得林大將之諒解與承認、而此第三次補充計劃、須要急速圓滑實施、假令以此計劃經費為基本之昭和十二年度預算、在議會順利成立、其實施時期因有會計年度之關係、比英美兩國海軍計劃不免遲延、海軍當局因有如此理由、不贊成第七十議會之卽時解散、故議會解散問題、將在林內閣之閣議、成為討論題目時、米內新海相將必披瀝其所信、表示海軍意見、希望新閣以愼重態度、處理議會問題、（二日同盟電）</p>
<h3>政友會抨擊內閣</h3>
<p>謂任陸軍要挾</p>
<p>［東京］政友會幹事長安藤氏發表談話如左、林內閣宣告成立、暫將政局安定、至以為慰、吾黨以國家為本位、對於新內閣當以嚴然之是是非非主義、行使政策之檢討、謹此宣言、惟林內閣旣念及政黨勢力、復遵循陸軍之要挾、而排除政黨、此卽表示林首相、並未具有確切不移之方針、並令人感其內閣為生來之弱體云、（二日同盟電）</p>
<h3>民政黨發表聲明</h3>
<p>對新內閣態度　在議會中决定</p>
<p>［東京］民政黨對於林內閣之成立、已於二日、以其幹事長永井談話之形式、發表聲明如左、林首相以忠誠果敢之人格與閱歷、處此重大之革新時期、擔當處理大勢之重任、自能勝任愉快、新內閣須認識現今時局之重大性、與全國國民共同克服時艱、吾人亦當由國家之見地、援助新內閣、同時實現國家生存之使命、安定民心、竭全力以圖貢獻、最近新內閣自有其政綱政策之發表、吾黨屆時亦當决定對新閣之態度、而相見於議會云、（一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>海陸兩相發表談話</h3>
<p>各行固定政策</p>
<p>［東京］初次閣議散會後、中村新陸相語記者曰、當此時局重大之際、不才筧拜軍政重任、殊痛感責任之重大、前陸相以其所致力之肅正軍紀、充實國防、一新庶政、為其使命、余信此卽為余之使命、當盡棉力、使之實現、舉國應認識時局之重大、協力打開難關、以扶翼皇運也云、（二日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］米內海相於初次閣議散會後語人如左、值此內外情勢重大之際、余拜領大命、担任海軍大臣之重责、自當以至誠奉公、並以清新之氣魄、率部盡忠、奉答聖明、而副國民所期待云、（二日同盟電）</p>

<p>昭和會山崎達之輔昨晚對林將允諾就任農相後、卽時聲明脫離黨籍、由山崎從來政治行動觀察、今後新政黨樹立運動、山崎必為重要主角、而於新黨成立之時、昭和會代議士之中、將有數人與山崎採取同一行動、</p>
<p>林大將現與“滿洲國”參議府參議田邊治通交涉、就任遞信大臣之事、然因田邊為“滿洲國”官吏、進行手續、須要相當時日、故不能參加二日親任式、由山崎達之輔兼任遞相出席親任式、</p>

<h3>林內閣之分析</h3>
<p>［東京］林內閣經過許多波折、已於今晨正式就職、溯自廣田內閣於一月二十三日午後辭職後、已十日於兹、在日本歷史上、組織新閣、費時十日、不為過長、蓋林氏組閣實際上僅費三日、故其成功實相當迅速也、新閣閣員中、除陸海二相外、結城豐太郎所佔地位、最為重要、其餘閣員、則皆屬三四流人物、組織新閣運動、首因國防大臣問題而遭頓挫、繼因中島及永井不願接受林氏所提脫離黨籍之條件而拒絕入閣、又遇波折、林內閣與政黨完全無關之事實、與廣田內閣中、政黨黨員僅為大臣之議事桌伴侶相較、在某種意義上、頗為重要、此種內閣、可使本身免受玩弄政黨之非難、日亦足使政黨不復負政府黨之空名、蓋彼等實際上固不應有此空名也、目前政友民政兩黨均保持中立態度、注視新閣之政策、以準備適當之策略、十河信二於林氏組閣中途退出內閣、此可表徵新閣已由“急進主義”轉變至“緩進主義”、惟新閣雖係中間型內閣、與齋藤·岡田·廣田·內閣同其旨趣、但兩者稍有差異、蓋林內閣係以軍閥·官僚·及財閥之合作為根據、而廣田則為軍閥官僚及政黨合作之內閣也、林氏昨日公佈新閣之計畫、內含㊀逐漸革新政策、㊁努力建立外交政策、㊂尊重憲政等條、陸軍中級將校對所謂逐漸革新政策、自難滿意、預料新閣與陸軍中級將校間、有發生磨擦之可能、至建立外交政策時、新閣是否有充分權力、統治日本各部份外交活動、亦屬疑問、再者、關於所謂“尊重憲政”、旣有不同之解釋、則將如何以具體政策、使種種歧異之解釋及觀念、趨於和諧、以避免衝突、實為各項問題中最感困難之問題、向陸海軍方面意見之殊異、益使該問題錯綜複雜、此種複雜關係、已影響解散議會問題、故在實行新政策前、林氏於內閣成立統一閣內意見之時、將招致各種難關、此卽新閣前途之所以未能樂觀也云、（二日中央社電）</p>
<h3>日遞信省五年計劃</h3>
<p>撥款千五百萬元</p>
<p>［東京］日本遞信省現為增進百噸以上商輪噸位起見、已採取五年計劃、擬於五年之中、將現有之四百二十一萬六千噸增加至六百萬噸、其方法係由政府撥款日金一千五百萬元、以津貼深水海輪及貨船、而以無定期船隻為主體、日本在今日海航國家之中、位居第三、但對外貿易之發達、已使其現有之輪隻不敷應用現在日本造船事業、已呈自一九一九年以來未有之盛況、而定造船隻之踴躍、反有供不應求之勢、此種現象實屬驚人、因前此數年來日本航業、在歐洲澳洲及大西洋中均感受種種不利、而不得不集中其實力於太平洋及印度洋也、一九三四年日輪之航行大西洋者、共四十八艘、計四十五萬噸、但至一九三六年、已減至三十三艘、在歐洲海洋之中、日輪亦感受同樣之挫折、蓋一九三二年日輪之航行歐洲者、共六十九艘、計六十三萬噸、今日僅十六艘計十七萬噸也、現日本遞信省已略變方針、對於津貼之發給、無定期船隻將與定期航輪、受同等之待遇云、（中央社二日路透電）</p>
<h3>希特勒演説俄報抨擊</h3>
<p>認英法懦弱　伸手已落空</p>
<p>［莫斯科］消息報論希特勒氏演説云、“希特勒已斷然聲明、一切均與前此相同、英法兩國曾向德國伸手、但其手乃久懸於空中、當然、此次結果與其謂為於歐陸和平可悲、毋甯認其對於彼復經希特勒公然在本質上加以侮蔑之諸公的尊嚴、更覺可慘耳、質言之、全世界祇能感謝希特勒、因渠已使目前形勢完全明瞭、目前問題之本質、乃在究竟能否用集體力量、在法西斯侵略者未陷世界於巨災以前、制止彼等、歐陸和平、實繫於此、至英法兩國所選之路綫、卽對德國殷勤誘導、則决不能達此目的、法西主義全部政綱之焦點、乃在經濟的與政治的膨脹、瘋狂的軍擴及戰爭、法西主義必須於認識彼之分他孤立各個現方被德國侵略分期威脅之和平國家伎倆並不成功、且亦無成功希望之後、方放棄此政綱、法西主義必須於了解、渠將遭遇諸和平國家之立時的聯合嚴重打擊之後、方放棄此種侵略、希特勒茍被迫達到此種認識、或將遲疑停止、不向歐陸及世界大戰之前途盲進也、然英法兩國其曾眞正採取任何手叚、以制止德國取此前途乎、德意法國主義在西班牙之血的冒險、幾曾遭嚴重之阻制、德國對和平民主的捷克所採、由歐洲和平觀之、絕對不能容忍之立塲、幾曾遭逢有組織之正常打擊、英國之政策、其眞能使希特勒認識英國眞準備擁護集體和平組織耶、對此諸問題、吾人必須答曰、否、然英法兩國、尤其英國、苟仍繼續動搖、苟彼等仍用空談答復法西主義之行動、而其空談且旣不坦白又不肯定、則吾人苟計及希特勒之聰明、其結果將永遠為失望也、（一日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>法國空軍</h3>
<p>第一綫千五百架</p>
<p>［巴黎］衆議院頃於本日賡續辯論國防問題、航空部長谷特、當就法國空軍現狀、加以説明云、“吾國發明家與製造家、雖曾一度落於他國同業之後、厥後急起直追、業巳恢復原有地位、吾國空軍亦巳成為全世界最强大者之一、據余所知、世界各國空軍、其機械較之吾國為優者、僅有蘇聯一國、雖然、吾國空軍機械之精良、仍可為國家增光、至於吾國所有飛機、為數究屬若干、恕余未便奉告、但他人如向君等談及吾國空軍機械、務望諸君審愼處之、而勿予輕信、線各項飛機總數之中、有可立卽出發應戰者、其與他項飛機、自未可混為一談也、或謂吾國飛機共有一千五百架之多、此乃指第一綫飛機而言、并非全數祇有一千五百架之謂、吾人自六閱月以來、卽在航空方面加緊工作、有非他國所可比擬者、第一綫飛機因而增加百分之三十七、空軍所用彈藥、增加百分之五十、軍器增加百分之七十、并曾建造根據地若干處、至於士氣之旺、猶其餘事也云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>廣東建設廳長劉維熾談東巡觀感</h3>
<p>經過公路三千餘里　親察所得印象甚好　各屬經濟潮屬最佳</p>
<p>廣州通信、建設廳長劉維熾、於一月二十三日出發巡視東區各屬、兹已完畢、於二十八晚由樟木頭乘廣九鐵路快車返省、二十九日晨出席省務會議後、隨同廳辦公、據劉廳長談此次出巡經過如下、</p>
<p>本人接長建廳數月、早已準備出巡各縣、視察地方交通情形、及經濟狀況、祇以廳務繁冗、忙於整理、故遲未成行、現以各事大致已整理就緒、循序進行、并有相當進展、特抽暇出巡各縣市視察、第一步先經東區巡視、次赴南路瓊崖各屬、此次出巡東區、係沿東路幹綫視察、由廣州出發、先到增城、經博羅·惠陽·海豐·潮陽·而至汕頭、由汕頭轉潮安·揭陽·豐順·梅縣·興甯·五華·紫金·惠州·而至樟木頭、乘車返省、在此一星期內、經過路綫約共三千華里、沿途視察所得、印象甚好計視察目的、一為公路查</p>
<p>東區公路</p>
<p>除省道外、以惠州及潮梅兩處、較為發達、現以路面而論、普汕·汕樟·潮揭·及梅縣附屬·惠州附城幾段、非常完整、大可媲美各省最良之公路、此外其他各公路路面、多不平坦、有被雨水冲壞者、有因車輛傤量過重所致者、因東區公路路基所用泥質、不如南路泥質帶有膠性之好、故易於損壞現已飭負責人東路行車處、及各縣政府、與民營行車公司特別注意修理、同時道路兩旁植樹太少、除去上述較好之數段植有樹木外、其他各處均無植樹、查其原因有二、㊀有一部份因雨水過少、植而不生、㊁有一部份因鄉民不知愛惜、任意摧毀、現已飭令特別注意、加植道旁樹木、關於橋梁方面、除已築有三合土者尚稱完整外、其他臨時建築木橋因日久生修、或工料不堅、已多損壞、查此項道路橋樑在平時關係貨客運輸極大、根本解决辦法須由政府籌一鉅欵、將木橋改建三合土鋼根、然後得垂永久、祇以政府財力有限、末能一時辦到、故須分兩步實行、先將所有木橋盡行改善、擇其重要者改建三合土、其次關於</p>
<p>行車情形</p>
<p>查本省公路行車約分兩種、一為省道係由政府所辦、一為縣道、多屬民營、因縣道建築時、係由人民自行籌欵、所以行車權亦交與人民、因行車權有官民之分、故管理亦不一致、往往省道行車與縣道缺乏聯絡、妨礙交通極大、以後改善辦法、則須省道行車與縣道切實聯絡、并定一準確時間表、以利便客商往來、現已飭本廳主管人員妥擬辦理、至各公路所用車輛、民營所購置者、雖有一部份、尚屬整潔、其他已多數殘舊、省道行車車輛、因其應用年齡已足、故多屬舊爛、現經飭由車路行車處添置新車、以資改善、計第一批巳定妥者、共有十輛、一個半月便可裝好應用、第一批再購十輛、陸續交換、惟是東路行車獲利有限、在平時僅足維持現狀、若加以從新改換車輛、則負擔甚重、但希望改良後、客商樂於乘坐、營業有進展、則可以抵補也、再其次關於各屬</p>
<p>經濟狀況</p>
<p>查東區經濟狀況、以潮屬為最佳、其次則為梅屬再次為惠屬潮屬生產最大宗者、一為蔗糖去年蔗糖一項、約值一千七八百萬元、次為柑菓、每年約值百餘萬元、再次為抽紗陶器、均有鉅量出產、此外尚有華僑滙欵、年有數千萬元、近年因世界不景關係影響、華僑滙欵減少、生產亦滯銷、至去年巳漸有起色、以後情形、必日有可觀、關於糧食方面、除揭陽一縣以外、其他各縣、均不足給、每年向外輸入洋米、為數甚鉅、不過潮屬、揭陽糖廠之設、但以該處地方情形、設置大規模糖廠、殊不經濟、因該管人民向有製煉上糖習慣、咸不願將蔗售與糖廠、卽有願意出售、亦多索高價、如果糖廠欲自行蕃植甘蔗、則潮屬田地價甚高、因此、成本亦甚重、有此原因、糖廠製糖成本太高、獲利太微從經濟原則而論、該揭陽糖廠、實應遷往南路或瓊崖始合、因南路瓊崖各處地價較廉、且可以廉價購蔗、故發展自易也、梅屬米糧亦不足過去生產、以興甯上布為最大宗、每年運往各地銷額甚鉅、其次尚有水菓出產近年因不計氣關係、土布銷路略減、故漸有水菓之經營、礦產亦有少數、至　屬方面、則因地質不甚肥沃、現雖有蔗糖廠之設、但所種甘蔗、不大優良、除蔗糖外、尚有各種礦產、紫金帶出鎢甚多、人民經營者亦衆、除上述以外、關於各屬造林、所在多有、不過以前方法幼穉、并無整個計劃、現各屬所有林木、多為松杉兩種、杉木尚可供建造之用、惟松木則祇供柴或原料、政府對此、亦極注意、并在各縣設有林塲、分設苗圃、逐漸增植各種林木數年後、東區林業、定可發展也、至於</p>
<p>電話交通</p>

<h3>幾個有關英語敎學的中等敎育問題（五）</h3>
<p>— 王世杰</p>
<p>然後這些事業纔能充實穩固、然後國家纔能進步、今後的中等敎育應當將升學與就業懸為兩樣同等重要的目標、説得具體一點、就是除注意造就領袖人才之外、更應注意為國家社會的事業造就中下級的幹部人才、</p>
<p>第五、中等學校現行謀程與英語教學中等敎育全部的范圍很廣、問題很多、以上所説的、只就與今天大會的主要題目關係比較密切的幾個基本問題、説明目前切迫而應當注意的事情、並且以上所説的、沒有提出甚麼抽象、高遠的理想、只就目前的事實、討論今後應當逐漸變革的事情、我現在很簡單的總括起來、就是、㊀中等敎育應當培養切合實用的知識、㊁中等敎育所培養的知識應當是理論與實騐並重、㊂中等教育應當培養學生自動的精神、㊃中等敎育應當對於學生升學與就業平均的注意具體的説、就是除了培養領袖人才之外、更應當養成多數健全的中下級幹郃人才、我們如果覺得這幾點原則、是切近事實符合需要、不妨對於這幾點加以比較充分的討論、喚起朝野各方面更深切集中的注意、使這幾點原則能得全國敎育界與其他各界普遍的贊助與一致的主張、使以後全部中等敎育的發展能以受這幾點原則的支配得着平均與和諧的發展、這幾年來敎育部對於全國中學與師範學校、職業學校之調節、各類學堂裏面課程之修改、整頓設備的充實、都曾想根據我們所能想得到的原則、做了一些初步改革的工作、我們只能承認這僅是一個開山闢路的初步工作、但是事情太大、也太複雜、應當注意的方面太多、經騐雖然都有一些、終覺得把握很少、如果在上面所提出的原則能够成立、今後的改革、自然必須是漸進的、隨時遵照經騐之所許、進而求其一步一步的實現、要實現這些原則、一個很重要的工作當然是中等學校裏面的課程、現行的中等學校的課程曾經過幾次的修改、是集合許多人的思想與經騐的結果、並且、我們還在隨時根據新的經騐、新的事實、努力使之更完備與更切合需要、最近中學的課程的修訂、不過幾月前的事、關於中等學校體育的規程、也剛公布不到幾天、將來中等學校的課程、如果再到了應當修訂的時候、也應當受如以上幾種原則的支配、與課程有關的敎材敎授法也應當逐步的改良、使之合乎如以上所述的幾種原則、這樣有原則有計劃有系統的改革需要相當的時日、金錢與經騐、但是我們相信、經過這樣的改革、必能使中國的中等敎育耳目一新、</p>
<p>今天是中國西方語學會在北平開大會的頭一天、所討論者主要題目與中等學校、尤其是中學的英語敎學關係最為密切、英語是初中與高中的主要課程之一、在初級中學裏面、單就上課的時間來説、英語佔每個學生第一星期的總時數、平均超過八分之一、在高級中學裏面、英語平均佔六分之一、而為一部份的學生、在高中第三年平均可以佔到超過四分之一、就是每星期共八小時、中學課程對於英語、承認他應得的重要、這樣時間的支配可算十分的充裕、若將每個中學生六年中花費在英語上課的時間約略的計算起來、初中約有四三○點鐘、高中約有五四○點鐘到六五○點鐘、兩樣合計約有九七○點鐘到一○八○點鐘、這是指着上謀的鐘點説、假定每一點鐘的功課、需要兩點鐘來預備、六年共需預備的時間約為一九四○點鐘到二一六○點鐘、將上課與預備的鐘點加起來、一個高中學生在畢業的時候用之於學習英語方面的時間、六年之間一共約有二九一○點鐘到二一四○點鐘、這是一個可驚的數目、一個中學的學生用這樣長久的時間在一門比較普通的功課上、假如他是一個普通用功的學生、而敎材敎員與敎授法也都合宜、他的成績縱然不能够極其優良、至少對於初步的基本知識應當得到一個相當豐富的收穫、與相當確實的把握、對於英語的寫讀説、應當得到相當透澈的了解與相當的自信心、但是事實上、現在高中畢業生的英語成績、一般是不好、每年大學招收新生的英語試卷成績是一般的令人失望、不但對於英文普通文法的結構大都弄不清楚、不能成句成章、就是一些常見的英文字的拚法寫法、也大都謬誤百出、對於英語的理解能力、更是異常薄弱、閱卷的人所得的印象、往往很壞、就二十四年度的大學新生入學試騐的外國語成績統計看、國立與公立專科以上學校的新生、有百分之六十是在六十分以下、而入學試騐的分數、一般並不太嚴、這種情形、凡是辦理過大學招生試騐的、都曉得、自然英語敎學在其本國以外的人、有其特別的困難誰也不能否認、但其困難、説是特殊則可、説是特別大則不一定、比起理化數學等科目來不見得更為困難、現在的情形、給大學敎育造成一個極大的難題、高中畢業生的英語程度、旣然如此之壞、進入大學之後、如具在頭二年、不肯特別努力、加以補習就感覺得閱讀原文參考書籍異常困難、或者是不可能如其還肯用功補習、那等於將中𣸈應做功課移到大學去做使大學別的功課不能不受影響而現在大學的功課尤其是理工科是相當的重、所以這個英語敎學的問題、直接關係中等敎育、間接影響高等敎育、最重要的事、是學生不能參考原文書籍、堵塞自修的一個重要門徑、斷絕研究高深學問的希望、如其是不進大學則進社會、他在英語上、不但不能利用從前所學的東西、並且更不會有長進、連從前所學的都會一齊忘掉、從前六年間所費的三千點鐘的工夫、無異於付之流水、這是何等重大的損失、所以這個問題在目前是相當的嚴重、要謀補救、</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>多頭維持近期紗漲風重起</p>
<p>紗市前日狂落後、昨日轉趨安定、實因大戶對於多頭地位、仍不放鬆、印商二月期亦不放棄、長豐·賡豐·錦昌等多額仍在加碼、於是檯風忽緊、近期獨挺、由海外紗市不振、實需不暢、同業傾向拋賣、精緻殊濃云、</p>
<p>標紗大戶拖進</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月一律下降、本月期跌風劇烈、因上日某棉公司躉批出檔檯面鬆而自濫、今則承虛風續進、空方乘機高壓、詎料長豐代某商努力拖進、錦昌亦買、為額殊鉅、所有飄浮之籌碼被其投盡、一盤後徐徐回升、結果各月比上日敗盤價均跌一·三·五角、午後開盤市況較緊、各月又見上升、以大戶依然買進、但現紗交易淡泊、三品紗價下跌　人氣未受牽制、本月甚昂、結果二月比上午收盤價漲一元一角速漲二·三·四角查賣出澄記一千二百包、恒益一千○五十包、裕人二千五百包、大豐三千三百五十包、瑞大一千二百包、大昌成千八百包、梅記一千五百包益記六百五十包、合興六百包、買進大孚一干一百包、錦昌二千二百五十包、賡豐四千六百五十包、望泰興一千九百五十包、昌成一千○五十包、長豐一千包、潤康一千一百包、福康六百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、（參見版面）</p>
<p>綫價獨漲一元</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚稱不薄、其中綫交易甚旺、查全日各帮買去統計一千○六十五包售價平平、綫漲一元、各帮買額列下、（參見版面）</p>
<p>散戶扒補棉價一度回漲</p>
<p>棉市穩靜、趨勢異常和平、大勢仍屬不脫徘徊徬徨之象、漢口帮稍有扒補、大孚長和購進殊夥、但現棉生意清寂、廠需呆木云、</p>
<p>標花不乏看跌</p>
<p>標花前市開盤因美棉續挫、印棉微漲、紗市不靈、近日跌風甚烈、一盤後散戶又來扒補、同時紗市回好、市價漸漸回漲、但塲內成交甚稀、結果各月比上日收盤價漲一角至一角半、午後開盤、市情平穩、各月上下甚鮮、因美棉水患棉田影響不擴大、看跌者尤夥、結果各月比上午收盤價跌五分至一角、查賣出賡豐一千八百擔、瑞大五千擔、永裕二千一百擔、大昌成一千七百擔、益昶一千三百擔、長豐三千擔、協成一千擔、永大一千四百擔、聚興一千二百擔、大豐一千二百擔、買進大孚八千四百擔、大豐一千三百擔、長和五千九百擔、潤康一千五百擔、福康九百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現棉到銷兩寂</p>
<p>現棉消費沉悶、廠需寂寞、來源姚花二百包、通花全無云、</p>
<p>一月份紗廠採辦原棉激減</p>
<p>某棉業機關調查、本年一月份中上海中日各廠購買棉花量合計為七萬七千一百四十包、與去年十二年中量比較激減四萬三千八百廿八包、其中日商紗廠買進者為三萬零三百廿三包較前月减二萬八千八百七十三包、華廠買進量為四萬六千九百十七包、亦減一萬六千九百五十五包、查其減少原因、謂廢歷年關紗廠工人有幾天休息、廠方需用减少也兹將中日各廠買進成交之額及花名摘錄如下、（單位包）</p>
<p>美棉漲後又遭挫折</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况堅穩、各月跌磅音至漲四磅音、晨初、利物浦電訊良好、水災狀況不定、同業買進近月、經紀商及外商買進遠月市勢堅挺、惜五月期漲至一角二分七厘時、遭遇極大阻力、其後多頭了結、及買進外棉以套美棉市價轉疲、同業靜候押欵棉花出售時之舉動、蓋恐低級棉套於塲中、市況或將受其壓迫故也、收盤平平、計現貨跌四磅音、頭貨跌二至六磅音、英棉現貨漲二點、期貨跌一至二點、印棉因國外消息利於買方、同業及投機家購進而堅、其後、利物浦消息良好、市況益堅、計平果爾漲○·二五至○·五羅比、奧姆辣漲一至一·二五羅比、白羅溪不動、原電錄左、（一日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二日開盤預測、白羅溪為二百二十七羅比、奧姆辣為二百○九羅比、跌一·五羅比、平果爾為一百八十二羅比半、跌一·五羅比、</p>
<p>日紗花現漲期跌</p>

<p>所有廿五年底市價、與現價、前已登載、因時間關係、已有更動、兹再另列一表、以便比較、（參見版面）</p>
<p>泉片靑開十一元</p>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平平、公會劃盤二四粗砂白以四八九及白、則原價、本廠綿白振記大華金心等亦乏更動、號盤僅有建帮開出泉州片靑百五十餘件、初談十元八角、後以其他大半未肯跟兌故以十一元成交、但尚有二百餘包仍守仔未售、漳刁靑聞暗盤不及十三元、大部份以時日侷促而春盤且有好望、是以亦在守持中、</p>
<h3>南北貨</h3>
<p>潮紅米產價報漲</p>
<p>潮州紅米因產區原料報漲市價隨升如上擋劃申須三十五元許比前漲二元、申莊劃申二十八元許、比前漲三元、查此間存底亦薄、兹值結束在卽無甚上落然產價旣升、則春盤勢必轉緊無疑、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>遠期新粉上漲乏力</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈先漲繼跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥近跌二角、遠小四八分、坎拿大好八分、利物浦漲一便士零、當開價後因前日之餘風未退、而洋麥報價、亦有漲有跌、是以市塲人心、仍趨俏利本月份適客帮微有生意、故各月份開價、均漲二三分不等、七月份則業外投機活躍、高抬奇速、最高竟提至五角八分、惟新粉時期、上落毫無把握、故業中人反淡漠視之也、迨至下午開盤、以結賬期近、客戶交易了結居多、實銷亦復有限、故復逐步低落、七月份則業外不抬散多回吐跌勢亦猛、至收盤竟與前日一無出入、照業中人之推測如年景良好、此種新粉市值、實難站住云、</p>
<h3>近期麥空拍無市</h3>
<p>昨日麥市上午開盤、各月份市面異常寂寞、因洋麥互有漲落而市塲情形、均以結束之故無心注意、故二三月份均空拍無市、四月份初稍好、總則回平、六七月份新麥、因標粉高抬人心稍佳、較好二三分、迨至下午開盤、二三月份又無做開、四月份以下、因粉市回跌、人心亦軟至於新麥市情、完全須看年景、目下雙方均少把握後步競爭當不致過分激烈也現麥因廠胃已停、又無見交云、</p>
<p>客秈又到三萬餘包</p>
<p>兹市面無大變化</p>
<p>昨客秈到頭仍旺、前昨二天中新到又達三萬包以上、惟大部份行販貨主已擬紅盤中再行出權日因粵省缺糧、期望甚佳、故在此存充到湧而乏暢銷之際、市面仍可站住、昨本街尚活廣州汕頭廈門各帮亦多點綴、然進意不濃、市面亦難拉起、全日開出湘米一百五十包、漢糙二百二十包、溫台秈六百五十包、江西米三千三百二十九包、</p>
<h3>白粳以中下檔為最俏</h3>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來源三十七八號、市上各貨交易因總結束將至、致各店進胃平淡、市形白粳高中貨價轉軟勢、中下者稍緊數分、薄稻定勢、羊尖緊扣數分至一角、杜埠客尖及白元等價平定其餘各貨和平、</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源因阻船已抵埠共到四十餘號、貨共八千六七百石、內中薄稻有三十餘號、所以薄稻市況雖經包胃有天津靑烟等帮辦去二千餘包、而行情仍平平、厚粳雖到稀、然本銷不懈致市面呈定中帶軟、杜洋尖及陰變元均無上落、</p>
<h3>結束中之雜糧市</h3>
<p>全市祇有二三筆交易</p>
<p>雜糧市塲已入全部大結束時期、市塲中交易、寥寥二三批、市況照商情習慣、在此大結束期中、有要賣要買關係、所以大半不依作正市論、昨日黃豆銷塲、因廠家拋開二月內交貨四牌餅一萬一千片、（價為二元零七分）故廠胃得以問津、成交蚌埠黃豆十八車、價為五元九角及五元八角半、其外祗本街辦去漢口乍豆三百包、海城靑豆二百五十包云、</p>
<h3>證券</h3>
<p>公債多掉期賣買</p>
<p>昨日華商證券交易所、公債市塲交易愈形清寂、局勢沉悶、市塲人心呆滯、興奮氣象、頓形減色、檯面上均多掉賣買、市價亦呈恍惚之狀、升降遷定、惟因有一二大戶收買較勁甲乙種尚稱堅昂、當上午開盤、趨勢頗為平堅十·七十七號等收買較湧、散戶甚多掉期交易市價一致好起五分至一角半、次盤掉期愈涌、卅七·卅八號等均屬掉期、十六號頗多賣出、戊丁丙種降落角許、甲種遠期則昂一角半、下午開盤、籌碼供出稍湧、十六·卅號等均見出售、戊丁種下跌五分至一角、惟後檔為四十四·五十號等買進、上漲一角、收盤戊丙種多空堅持而無升降、乙甲種則為卅八號吸收踴躍、好起五分至一角牛、全日結果、戊種下月丁種近期及九六、下降一角許、餘均上漲一角至三角半、成交總數、計三百三十六萬五千元、兹將其漲跌高低比較、列表如左、（軍位元成交單位百元）（參見版面）</p>

<h3>文藝界座談會詳記（續）</h3>
<p>潘公展　六位主人、各位先生、今天、上海文藝界同人、相聚一堂、兄弟能够參加、覺得非常榮幸、同時覺得今後可以常有機會與各位先生相聚、這是要感謝各位主人的、方才看到統一救國運動的宣言、很是高興、個人對於宣言的大體是很贊成的、兄弟聽到樊仲雲先生説起希望各位先生發表對於宣言的意見、或者批舉幾位先生負修改的責任、兄弟略為有一點意見、不知道各位以為對不對、剛才有幾位先生説、不要再論左派右派、以免引起糾紛、我覺得這是很對的、大家如果要這樣做、應該先有共同的目標、假使共同的目標決定了、別的枝葉不必提起所謂“共信不立、互信不生、”就是這個道理、假使共同的目標不確立起來、决不會互信的、現在共同的目標已經有了、就是統一救國、大家也沒有反對的、今後祇要照這共同的目標努力、但我們决不是僅發表宣言而已、同時必須把統一救國的精神表現到文藝作品上去、然後統一救國、才有實際、我看到這宣言中、已經提到“一時代有一時代的文藝、”“一民族有一民族的文藝、”以及“實為我國民大眾的時代性與民族性的表現、”在現在這個時代、文藝作品、最要緊的一點、就是應該在文藝作品裏面、充滿着很豐富的民族性這樣、一方面可以使文藝作品、適合時代的需要、一方面可以團結全國的文藝界、不至於再有什麼陣綫的口號、無論是所謂人民陣綫、反人民陣綫、其實根本離不開整個的民族和國家、假使國家亡了、還有什麼人民陣綫可言呢、所以現在祇是整個的民族、要用什麼方法來救國的問題、全民族不是一部分人所能保全的、須用全民族的力量、保護全民族的人在全民族之內、决不能分什麼陣綫、所以中國不需要什麼陣綫、祇需要整個民族的團結和統一、富此民族存亡危急的時期、要把民族內部過去的種種小我的恩怨、在救護全民族大前提之下、完全消滅、為全民族共同努力、從前的文藝界為什麼不能團結起來、就是囚為沒有共同的目標、方才汪馥泉先生説過、因為左派右派不能一致、所以已往團結沒有成功、老實説、就是左派之內、也未必卽能一致、左派領袖出喪、為了爭總指揮、幾乎打得頭破血流、這還能應是一致嗎、這完全表示、文藝界沒有偉大的的氣魄、公正的胸懷、這樣的從事文藝運動、恐怕於國家民族毫無貢獻、再講左派裏面有所謂“國防文學、”與民族革命戰爭的大衆文學之分、一方面一定要説國防文學的對的、一方面一定要説民族革命戰爭的大衆文學是對的、老實説、口號不能當飯吃、這種無聊事理、有什麼來理會呢、在這個時候、我們不需要什麼不合時代的理論的文章、祇需要文藝作品怎樣來提起民族意識、團結民族精神、但是左派的作家、對於這些理論口角、在報紙上雜誌中長篇大幅的披露、使讀者們見了就頭痛、要知通編戲的人有編載的思想、導演的人有導演的手法、在公演的時候、不需要説明本人怎樣編戲、本人怎樣導演、大家祇要看你的戲、就可以知道編得好不好、導演得好不好了、否則自以為“意識正確、”有什麼用呢、所以希望文藝界的同人、要認清時代、本來文藝界諸君、是担任着很重要的工作、國家的興亡、一半在槍桿、一半在筆桿、以往我們罵軍閥、但是現在一般軍人、都漸漸覺悟了、團結一致、共同對外、而我們文人、倒還沒有團結一致、豈不可惜、知識份子是領導時代的、現在的時代、巳經走到整個民族共同努力復興的階段、假使文藝界再不趕快把握住這點共同來努力、那麼文藝界就不免要落伍了、前進與落伍、怎樣分別我以為並不是左派就是前進、右派就是落伍、我們要先認織時代、領導時代的是前進、沒有認清時代、還是拿舊東西為滿足的、就是落伍、方才樊仲雲先先説過、現在講愛國、那一個不贊成、可是前幾年有人罵他是愛國主義者、當時以為該愛國就是落伍、從前以為愛國是落伍的人、到了現在、忽然也覺得國之當愛、不再認為落伍了、還有煎幾年、如果來講國防、在他們就以為落伍、因為那時候他們是講“國際主義”的、説“工人無祖國”的、如果你講國防、就是國家主義派、但是現在國防文學、却又是顶“前進”的了、這不是很離奇可笑的現象麼、所以我説無所謂前進落伍、祇要看時代的需要、所謂國防文學、乃是由普羅文學演化而來的、為什麼普羅文學、忽然搖身一變而變成國防文學呢、這是由於第三國際的指示、老實説、來路貨的共產黨、總比土貨的共產黨高明一點、他們看出不能再照老計劃實行、環境變了、計劃也應該改變、於是他們有一個决議、西班牙的人民陣綫、應該怎樣、法蘭西的人民陣綫、應該怎樣、中國的人民陣綫、應該怎樣、一一規定出來、他們認為中國現在應該喊出抗日的口號、抗日最能引起同情、所以在文藝界就把普羅文學的口號、一變而為“國防文學、”這是有第三國際大會的决議、可為佐證的、但在上頭巳經議決了、而下面的中國共產黨、與所謂左翼作家還沒有接到命令、還是提倡普羅文學、到了接到命令、才立刻改為國防文學、為什麼要等第三國際的命令才改呢、這完全表現他們失去了自信力、所以我們現在第一步要恢復我們文藝界的自信力、各位先生、要知道文藝界所領導的民衆、比軍隊還要多些、軍長師長、至多帶領幾千幾萬人、而文藝界的先生們所領導的讀者、比軍長師長所統率的兵、多過幾十倍、所以希望今後的文藝界同人要把小我的見解放棄、在復興民族的總目標之下、共同努力、我相信中國的民族復興、一定得到各位很大的助力、所以兄弟很希望在這宣言裏面、能够提到“共同努力、在文藝作品上提倡民族意識、發揚民族情緒、促進統一、鞏固統一、”這一點、不知諸位先生以為如何、其次方才已經有人説過、我們的文藝協會、不僅今天到會的人都參加、而且希望今天沒有到會的文藝界同人都得參加才好、</p>
<p>邵洵美　今天承蒙諸位先生惠然光臨、並且發表了許多高見、兄弟代表六位主人、敬致誠摯的謝意、此次座談會的時間雖然短促、不能使每一位先生、都有發表宏論的機會、但是已得到了許多寶貴的意見、可以供全國文藝界人們的參考、而且今天的座談會、正是文藝工作者集體努力的開始、中國文藝協會成立以後、我們見面談話的機會正多着呢、最後敬祝在座諸君健康、（完）</p>

<p>携去飾物</p>
<p>等帶回、該案尚未了結、而程氏兹亦在上海新閘捕房告訴陸冠曾、及裕昌當之經理俞某、共同侵佔本人存於元利當內價值十一萬餘元之飾物、經捕房起訴於特一法院、業經一度傳訊各情、巳誌本報、昨晨、由詹良策推事開刑二庭續訊、陸程氏偕其代理律師凌啟鴻、俞某、陸冠曾偕</p>

<p>齊盧戰爭</p>
<p>時、我與陸冠曾携帶首飾箱來滬、由陸送我至母家後、我卽將該首飾箱交陸存放於元利當內、當時是否有人看見、則巳不能記憶、庭上卽詢以上次勸令和解、是否有和解可能、氏答、並未談過和解、吳律師卽稱、敝律師與原告律師曾約略談及、但被告方面主張</p>
<p>繼續同居</p>
<p>而原告方而則主張離異、故無法進行、至被告方面、現有二種證據、一卽原告於二十二年以三記名義在福源錢莊租用保管箱一具、且在以前調解時、原告代理律師致被告之函件乃原告致被告叔父之函件內、均未提及、有</p>
<p>侵佔首飾</p>
<p>之事、庭上乃命俞某及證人陳惠泉、祝少卿、皆行退出法庭後、卽向陸冠曾請訊、據陸供稱原告之首飾、向由彼自己保管、祗結婚時之大盤六禮、則由我置於元利富之鐵箱內、鎖匙由我保管、但於去年廢年大除夕、向我取去鎖匙、謂因欲吃喜酒、須取用首飾我乃囑俞陪同原告來滬、後</p>
<p>據俞告知</p>
<p>、原告已將首飾箱取去、而原告自歸甯後、卽不願回家、雖曾由戚友貝潤生·秦潤卿·劉正康·及原告之姊葛程氏·及其夫葛文卿·等調停、我曾將地產一處之單據道契印鑑等交與原告保管、乃後原告忽予反悔云云、庭上旋向陸及陸程氏詰問首飾之件數價甚群、旋命俞某至庭、據稱、前由陸冠曾命我</p>
<p>陪同原告</p>
<p>來滬取用首飾、在去年正月初十左右、同往將首飾箱取去、據原告説係欲另置於福源錢莊也、繼由證人祝少卿證明原告至元利當將首飾箱取去、旋由陳惠泉證明曾售與原告珠子三百粒、小鑽六十粒、及值價七千餘元之鑽戒一只、經詹良策推事核供、乃諭本案改期候傳葛程氏·葛文卿·等到案再訊</p>

<h3>徐益控譚焯宏濫押枉判罪</h3>
<p>管押六十八日之久　狀請交保又未獲准</p>
<p>前上海地方法院刑庭批事譚焯宏、因在任時與上海律師楊紹彭朋比受賄、違法瀆職、為司法部飭檢察處扣解、解至吳縣地方法院、初審判决譚處有期徒刑八年、楊處有期徒刑六年、經上訴江蘇高等法院减處譚有期徒刑四年、楊減處為三處六月、尚在二審上訴中、惟在任時之</p>
<p>違法瀆職</p>
<p>時、有曾任上海律師之徐益、亦為被害人之一、是以徐益向地方法院刑庭自訴譚焯宏犯刑法一百二十五條第一項第三欵濫押枉判罪、昨日上午十一時、由李學燈推事開庭、徐益供、年三十一歲、廣東中山人前為律師、現住塘山路一百七十一弄十三號、被告譯焯宏、皆在鈞院推事任內、與楊紹彭互相結納、去年程李恬志誣告自訴人偽造文書、原委李時蕊代理、旋悉該案歸被告承審、乃假託加委楊紹彭代理之名義、</p>
<p>向其行賄</p>
<p>四千元、因以被告將自訴人濫捕羈押、並枉判徒刑四月、嗣向江蘇高等法院提起上訴、始獲平反、然已受押六十八日之久、不半載、被告與楊紹彭明目張膽、招搖索賄、經人告發、遂由吳縣地方法院分別處刑、而被告承審自訴人案件受賄、卽為該案初審判決認定罪行之一、但至提起上訴江蘇高等法院、被其朦蔽、認為初審對於該部分之證據、</p>
<p>尚欠充韌</p>
<p>故撤銷改判、按被告受賄部分、難倖免然濫押枉判、仍係違法、旣未經裁判在前、又於侵害國家法益中、同時具有侵害個人法益之故意、故現在提起自訴、而按照審理時羈押被告之範圍、較值查中為狹、參考刑事訴訟法第二○條之規定、甚為明顯、司法部去年復三令五申、</p>
<p>厲行保釋</p>
<p>責付、可見羈押刑事被告、應如何愼重、然查自訴人昔被程李恬志誣告偽造文書、在偵查中非唯未受羈押、抑且並不具保、奉傳三次、又皆遵時候訊、况自訴人在滬者固定住所、正常職業、而案中又無其他被告、足認謂有申飾之虞、一言以蔽之、自訴人亳無受羈押之原因、乃被告竟介髦法令、於溽暑薰蒸中、突然諭押、當時辯護人何百謙</p>
<p>竭力請求</p>
<p>責付、或則交保、在旁聽之王建航律師、亦雅願共同責付被告、諭仰具狀候示、迨函進狀、又不批示、蓋其明知理曲、藉以搪塞嗣至宣判日、自訴人被處徒刑四月、復重申前請被告又曰、具狀候核、此後遂於是年七月二十日·同月三十日·及八月十七月·再三狀請、自思縱就被告認定之罪刑而論、情節亦至輕微、依法洵無羈押之可言、且</p>
<p>無論准駁</p>
<p>依刑事訴訟法第二百○一條之規定、應有裁定、被告因明知依法不能駁回、又受有賄賂、准則難見行賄之人、乃束擱不加裁定、使無從抗告、俟卷呈高院後、被告始批示着逕向上級聲請、藉以塞責、復查被告所為判决抹煞一應有利於自訴人之反證、徒托空言、竟云“告訴人之詞、當屬可信、亦是情理之言、”等徇私偏判强人入罪云云、被告未提到、庭諭本案應候吊卷、再行訂期審訊、</p>

<h3>貫獻話值得表揚的發明人</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>吾們因為提倡國貨，時常對於一般國貨工業家，特別重視，更特別景仰，尤是要崇拜而值得表揚的，是許多堅苦卓絕的發明人。</p>
<p>以後吾們很想多留些篇幅，來紀述國內一般發明事物的工業家，有名的發明，固然值得景仰，可是一般無名的發明人，尤其要大大的表揚一下，更難得的，一般出身於工人或小職員階級的，絞腦瀝血，費去無數的心思，才力，經過無數的艱難困苦，纔得有所成就，實在是難能可貴為民族工業史上爭光不少。</p>
<p>最近南開大學應用化學科發明了棉子油中的蛋白質，和玉蜀黍軸可以提出糖醛及醋酸蟻酸糖類等質素，我們很是敬佩，認為辦學數十年，至此已有些收穫了。可是大學為研究學術之地，發明事物是應分的。至如以一機廠工具夫，而能經七年之苦功有所發明，莫如發明晴雨兩用摺傘，大大值得表揚之龔星磊君。</p>
<p>龔君為津浦路浦鎮機廠工具夫，年二十五歲，浙江杭縣人，僅受小學敎育，民十七年至浦鎮機廠任工具夫，工作餘暇，喜閱研究發明之書報，因之對發明事業，興趣特濃，數年前卽立志創造袖珍兩用傘，於晚間打樣鑄模，同儕譏其妄，長官責其愚，甚至以開除相挾，令其停止研究，龔均不為動，公餘，工作如故，同居之人以其擾人清夢，羣趨責之，惟房主鑒其誠，特予寬容，研究歷十八月，第一度製成雛形，呈請實部專利，實部以其構造未精，不予批准，龔毫不灰心，研究如故，又歷三年八月，修正改良，第二度再呈實部專利，該部以其使用不靈活，再度批駁，龔君再接再厲，格外奮勉，逐步修改，卒底於成，而最近始取得實部之專利權，總計先後已歷七年矣。此難能可貴之發明人，吾人值得表揚，更值得崇拜，願國內有無數之發明人，陸續披露於本刋，豈僅本刋之榮幸，亦國貨工業界之光輝也。</p>
<h3>國貨展覽與打開鄉鎮出路</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>秋熟豐收，新榖登塲，正是國貨廠商到內地鄉鎮上去唯一的時機，過去，國貨展覽之在內地，往往得不到良好的收穫，在這裏，我覺得國貨廠商眞欲打開這條廣大的出路，有幾點是需要改良的。</p>
<p>一普遍宣傳鄉鎮羣衆的腦筋簡單，確為一不可掩滅之事實，但好奇興嘗試的特性，却成反比例，過去，國展之在內地，往往忽略了這點，把宣傳認為無足輕重，在鄉鎮上，卽開一家小雜貨店，亦必大吹大擂，於事前吸引顧客，惟恐不周，這大規模的商塲，宜如何以具有興趣的宣傳，引起注意，而況鄉農是“跟帮上”的，愈是門前冷落得門可羅雀，愈是會望而却步，因此，普遍宣傳在鄉鎮上，亦是一個不可或缺的條件。</p>
<p>二布置清楚這無疑地是鄉鎮上沒有較寬大的房屋，足以從容布置所致，門前，樣語，廣告，旗幟，雜亂無章地張掛着，內部貨品則凌亂堆置，部分則界限不明，置身其中，不啻墮入五里霧中，旣無從逗留觀摩的地位，亦不能從容選擇貨品，其實，房屋雖小，亦儘可節省地位，以寬容其揷足餘地，貨物雖多，亦儘可有條不紊，以予人以醒目的認識。</p>
<p>三態度和善其次，鄉農大多態度與行動是比較不大方、而忸怩的，尤其是女子對於貨物與價值，往往瑣瑣屑屑的令人難受，而在都市中，服務慣了的店員，就會不自制地把不屑與不耐的神情洗露了出來，因此，如對於顧客詢問則動輒加以冷淡，而不予置答，服飾不整齊的，則加以監視式的注意或譏笑，使樸實無華的鄉農，侷促不安，這些雖有時為言語關係所造成，但服務員能態度和悅過人一點，鄉農亦儘受此一着。</p>
<h3>國貨聯營公司與國貨前途</h3>
<p>— 公瑾</p>
<p>最近國民經濟建設運動委員會聯合中華國貨產銷合作協會及各國貨工廠公司商塲介紹所等議設國貨聯營公司，聞已與實業部商洽圓滿。日內卽進行籌備成立，斯又國貨前途之一好現象也。</p>
<p>溯我國人自深怵於列强經濟侵略之害而提倡國貨以來，初期僅知空喊口號，施行消極的檢查等方法，近期方知組織團體，擬定具體計畫，注重於積極方面的設施。如成立各界服用國貨會，舉行國貨年，招考家庭訪問員等等，由空言宣傳而入於實際的行動，均係國貨運動進步之徵。但多數人購用國貨尚有兩點困難，其一為國貨與外貨之鑑別困難，蓋以前國貨拙樸尚易辨認，近年仿製洋貨，進步甚速，出品有時且勝於舶來，加以一般奸商，利用國人愛國心理，故將外貨冒充國貨，更令購者為難，是以專營國貨之塲所，急需設立，以前各地雖有集合各國貨工廠舉行國貨展覽會專售國貨之舉，但多屬臨時性質，成效不大，非有永久性質之專營國貨公司不可。其二為缺乏完備之國貨售賣塲所，蓋近代文化進步，日用物品，種類繁頤，需用者如須於許多不同的塲所方能購得需要之物品，則何等麻煩，且於時間上亦何等不經濟，故百貨公司遂應此需要而起，集各地各種物品於一處，購者卽於此一處卽可得其衣食住行等日常需要之一切物品，何等便捷，滬上先施永安卽其例也。惜彼輩大都為洋貨之總匯，推銷舶來品之總機關；而類此之大規模國貨的百貨公司，尚付缺如，今國人能有鑒及此，於各地籌設此類公司，於國貨前途之發展，必有甚大之帮助也。</p>
<h3>述許屈熿女士提倡國貨之根本辦法</h3>
<p>— 林文女士</p>
<p>我現在對於訪問的經騐，是日益增加，現時已認為絲毫不感着困難了。可不曉得最近忽然給我這麼難防的打擊！雖然不感着灰心，而每天總不能很如意的給我以順利的經過。有一天陰沉的早晨、到和平邨，一共敲過了八家的大門，他們的回答都是出去哪，生病哪，家裏沒有人哪，有的坐在客堂中久坐了十數分鐘，結果還是説不在家！從第一衡一直敵到了最每一衡的二十一號，開門的同樣是個女僕，我遞她以名片，一面她請我坐在客堂中，當時我很留心裏面的聲響，從遠處聽到一位女人的聲音説：“請她坐一坐！女僕端茶出來，不一歇有一位年近五十操着北平口音，態度和藹，服裝樸素的主婦，走了出來，對我微笑着説，“我看見報上説是已經到達了這裏，我每日都在翹望，某日有兩個女性經過了我家門口，並且一面在窺望着。我以寫是訪問員來了，趕忙上前開門，最失望的是她們是持着為建築校舍的卡片和練習簿來向我募捐的。怪不得熱心為國的女訪問員也為了良莠不齊的影響，而感着意外的阻撓。今天你給我盼望到了，我們可以暢談一下……”我認為她所發表之言論，似有宣佈之價值。以下便是許屈熿女士的談話：</p>
<p>㊀我國工業近來日益進步，國產頗不乏精良出品；惟化妝品一門，據海關進口的報告，逐年增加的數目驚人，推其原因，無非消耗者概屬一般有產階級的婦女。可是根本講起來，總為了國產化妝品未有適當的出品的原故！如香粉，香水，洗臉皂等，須求其不損傷皮膚，而適合乎衛生為原則，各化妝品商應協力同心，彼此公開研究，以謀打倒舶來品為目的，不能以營利為先，同業競爭為目的；一方須靠貴夫人闊太太們等的文字提倡和宣傳之力量。庶幾可使一般當於模仿性的年輕婦女，競相仿效，則不難於最短期間中，使國產化妝品活躍於市面！</p>
<p>㊁上海各中大小各學校學生，除小學生稍知愛國提倡國貨外，他如中大以上學生，對於國家觀念反薄弱！他們的心理大多數給歐化，衣食住所需，無一非引用舶來品。西裝是外國原料；酬酢往來，非四餐不行；傢具則購自外國商店，彼此相習成風，遂至不可收拾！且各學校並無規定制服，此不但足長奢靡之風，而與提倡國貨一事簡直背道而馳。希有心國事書，設法呈請敎育當局，通令全國各學校（尤其是上海一隅），規定學生衣著制服，原料須採用國貨，以此旣能提倡質樸之風，復可收提倡國貨之效！</p>
<p>㊂國貨廠家，最好能與各學校，各團體當局聯絡，在每校中設立國貨樣品陳列處，陳列各種有價值的國貨樣品，每樣品上寫明出品工廠之名目，及各該廠電話購貨部之電話號碼，以備熱心愛用國貨者可以隨時採購；同時各廠家可予以各學校，各團體以特別優待之辦法：卽凡持證購物者，可給以折扣。此法天津女青年會已實行過，上海儘可仿效。至於小學校方面，可請各校長在每週朝會時，對小學生以簡要的宣傳，和某國人銷售我國食物所用之毒計：如白糖中之屬白色粉屑；白米中員白色石屑；鹹魚中加以化學性毒品，使人食後慢性中毒等，皆可給小學生詳細講解，使其純潔的腦筋中，知道提倡國貨之必要，且叮囑他們隨時傳説給其家族與親友。未始非根本提倡國貨之好辦法？（未完）</p>
<h3>推銷説（二）</h3>
<p>— 定凱</p>
<p>對於相對人的接　，不但要研究和討論，還得有詳細的心理上分析。美國哈佛大學教授柯伯倫，對於顧客買貨動機，用心理學來測騐，並將其分析，公諸世人，兹節錄如下：</p>
<p>A原始類（購貨機能，全出自然無所謂理由，推銷者迎合之法，亦當適用此項本能。）</p>
<p>（一）與衆不同（二）堪資競美（三）特殊成就（四）保持健康（五）保護幼童（六）滿足食慾（七）促起壯志（八）聲色悦目（九）維護安全（十）崇尚時髦</p>
<p>B感情類（因感珜之衝動，推銷者不必動之以理。）</p>
<p>（一）增加美觀（二）身體舒適（三）家庭幸福（四）維持淸潔（五）佔爲已有（六）美風韻（七）娱樂（八）促進　　　　　（十）遊山玩水</p>
<p>C理性類（顧客買時，胸有成竹，售者必詳説優點。）</p>
<p>（一）堅固耐久（二）應用方便（三）效率增高（四）經濟無比（五）質地好（六）服務週到</p>
<p>我們看見了柯柏倫先生的心理分析，並且同時還要研究「推銷途徑」問題，假如把「推銷途徑」就經濟學理而言，則推銷的本身，也是成爲一種工具或物品，自製造家到經售商，再至門售商，到最末的消費者，所經過的各種過程，都是藉推銷本身爲工具，而圖其利潤，至此，我們認爲工廠主持人，應同時運用着三種心理上的研究</p>
<p>A適應市塲買賣過程中的途徑，並迎合其利益；</p>
<p>B消費者的心理，並注意其慾望與便利；</p>
<p>C風俗人情上的迎合，並注意其新陳代謝的機能。</p>
<h3>介紹袖珍晴雨兩用摺傘之功用</h3>
<p>袖珍晴雨兩用摺傘功用有三：（一）携帶便利，此傘略同電筒，長九英吋三，直徑可縮至一英吋半，可藏於袋中。（二）晴雨兩用，其用法，先取傘之滑圈，手抽出縮內之傘柄，撑開後與普通傘之形式相同，收縮時，左手取傘之滑圈，右手取傘之柄，而後左手向右轉，右手向左轉，轉至不動時，滑圈向下勒，傘柄同時亦向上推縮，而後藏入薄橡皮袋中。龔君甚願與人合作，或以專利權讓渡於人。</p>
<p>袖珍褶傘之大小及重量</p>
<p>（大型男用）收縮後之直徑可縮至一英寸半，長爲九英寸三分，重爲一磅，較普通之傘（上海福廠出品）輕六兩，撑開後之大小與普通傘相等。</p>
<p>（小型女用）收縮後之直徑可縮至一英寸一分，長九英寸三分，重爲九兩餘，撑開後之直徑爲三十六英寸。（龔星磊通信處浦鎭機廠設計股）</p>
<h3>長江各埠的國貨運動（下）</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>▲漢口　有漢口市國貨運動委員會，是根據中央方略，計劃全市國貨運動工作，由漢口特別市黨部，駐鄂綏靖主任公署，漢口市政府，武漢警備司令部，漢口市商會等十五個團體，聯合組織，設總務，宣傳，調查三大股，機關設市黨部，現由易葆恂氏主持；漢口有國貨市塲，各新聞紙不時編印國貨專刋；武昌，商業次於漢口，現方闢十里長街，陸氏抵達後，敎廳長程其保氏，曾一度召集各界舉行會議，今後預備武漢兩地，合組湖北省國貨運動委員會。</p>
<p>▲長沙　國貨運動，成績特著，有“湖南人民提倡國貨救國會”！現任常委周定宇，黃濟，凌瑋三氏，下設三組，紅織主任向榮庭，宣傳主任朱德齡，審查主任龔仲蓀；湖南士女，素具苦幹實幹美德！省會寡有耗資七十萬金的一座龐大的國貨陳列館！屋宇輝煌，矗立雲霄，為提倡國貨而造成這樣的一個推動的大本營！似乎在全國尚少發現，二三四層為陳列所，下層為推銷市塲，繡品，瓷器，鑛產，棉蔴，百貨雜陳，蔚然大觀；搜集這些土產，洵非易事；陳列館貼隣，更建有娛樂塲，引起人民的駐足和流連，像長沙國貨運動組織的健全，眞值得全國各地模範，逈非坐而言不知道起而行所可比擬呢？陸氏最後説：提倡國貨，不尚空談，要有訐劃的推進，上列省市，黨政等當軸，對提倡國貨，雖各有相當的推動和努力熱忱，尤希望中央與地方，有統一的名稱，主要分子，還在青年男女學生身上云云。</p>

<h3>單于求婚</h3>
<p>— （孫競文）</p>
<p>近來讀史看到漢高帝死後單于冒頓甚至向呂后下求婚書，“孤僨之君生於沮澤之中，長於平野牛馬之域，數至邊境願遊中國。陛下獨立，孤僨獨居，兩主不樂，無以自虞，願以所有，易其所無。”</p>
<p>那時中國雖受了這樣的侮辱，呂后雖然怒不可遏，終不敢向匈奴發兵，只得婉詞謝絕冒頓開玩笑的請求，覆曰：“單于不忘弊邑，賜之以書。弊邑恐懼，退日自圖，年老氣衰，髮齒墮落，行步失度。單于過聽，不足以自汗。弊邑無罪，宜在見赦！竊有御車二乘，馬二駟，以奉常駕。”</p>
<p>我恍然侵略者的要求是隨心所欲，被侵略者是敢怒不敢言，還要設法甘辭數衍。不過我們要知道漢高帝原來是用的委曲求全的合親政策，他先把自己的公主去獻給冒頓，以求茍安，終於使冒頓轉起岳母呂后的念頭來了。</p>
<p>“弱國無外交”是自古已然。委曲求全的政策是祇會引起侵略者無厭的野心的。</p>
<h3>新闢的蘇州相門</h3>
<p>— 必力</p>
<p>蘇州舊有閭、齊、婁，葑，盤，胥六門，後來又添闢了金，平二門。最近因為蘇嘉鐵路已通車，離蘇州的第一站在婁門與葑門之間，旅客進城，必須繞道婁門，甚威不便，所以便在婁葑二門之間添闢了一座相門。</p>
<p>現在，相門已經竣工，城門上是余井塘題的行楷“相門”二字。別的城門都鄰着熱鬧的街市，這裏可大不同了。城內是一絛潔靜的街道，沿着一泓清澈的流水。在一行整齊高大的樹木中露出了一角古寺。在城外，展着一幅更美麗的天然圖畫。一出城門便是一座長長的木建大橋，跨在那遼闊的城河上。這兒的河面比平門外更廣闊，所以那座橋有十二個橋洞，可以和寶帶橋媲美。現在該橋尚未竣工，我隨着一羣孩子們冒險地走了過去，怪有趣的一剎那！</p>
<p>過橋是一帶麥田和水蕩交錯着。一見那些水蕩便令人想起了佐餚的芡白，鮮嫩的藕，紅的菱，白的茭實。我沿河緩緩地走，看那疏疏的帆檣很悠閒的在河上流着；帆影倒過去落在那一帶青籐蔓繞的古城上。在這古城之內，露出了三個高高的塔尖。一切是那麼靜穆，只有輕快的白雲在上面掠過。突的從遠處傳過來一聲鐘響，驚飛了塔尖的烏鴉，提醒了遊客的歸思，衝散了一切沈寂。</p>
<p>去蘇州玩的朋友們，當你們游倦了虎邱或是獅林之後，不要忘了相門城外有這麼一幅清麗的含有詩意的圖畫。</p>
<h3>女兒有用論</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>二年之前，辭職而去的老茶房阿根，現在是穿起了馬袴呢大衣，啣着雪茄烟，坐起了雪亮的包車了。他時常的還上我們辦公處來玩耍，我們的處長，也待之如上賓，和他很投機，並時常的請他吃飯。同時，更謠傳着我們那位常在闹窮的處長是私人和他有着經濟往來的，不過這事也還無從證實。但阿根的何以會得如此豪闊，却是值得一説的。</p>
<p>四五年前，那是在一二八之後，阿根的處境之窮困，是任誰都知道的，因為他的家，是毀於砲火之下了，他的一個當製版工人，一個當皮革廠工人的兒子，都失業了。同時，在廠裏當看女工的三個女兒，也相繼的找不到每天掙着五六毛錢的工作了。在那時，全家的生活，幾乎完全靠他每月的近二十元的收入，所以他的午飯，是每天的大餅三枚。據説，晨晚二餐還沒有這麼豐美。</p>
<p>饑寒的壓迫，逼得他的三個女兒，不得不走上不怎麼名譽的道路上去，以博取衣食。最初時，都是當着私娼，接着，相率改業女茶房。在三年之前，大女兒混進了電影界去當配角。二女兒，去到一家小舞塲裏當舞女。小女兒在一家咖啡館中當女侍。一年之後，二女兒給一位買辦娶去作為小星了。小女兒和一位擁有多金的藝術家，發生了關係，而同居着了。在那時期中，他的大女兒，也由電影界，而改入了舞業圈中去，而且很快的，成了一位紅舞星。而更昌可賀的，他的二位失業了許久的公郎，因看那位當買辦的二姑爺的帶挈，居然的也能自立了。所以在二年之前，阿根辭職時，他的三位女兒，每月共計津貼他有三百元左右之巨。</p>
<p>在最近的二年中，他的大女兒，是給一位有名的銀行家，量珠騁去了，而且是寵擅專房。小女兒，與那藝術家脫離了關係，嫁給了某局長作繼室，到北地某省去作官太太去了。據我們的處長説，現在的阿根，已和二年前，大不相同了，手裏，至少當已有六七萬的花頭。雖然二個兒子，是沒有甚麼了不起，可是他的三位姑爺，却眞是不知怎麼給找來的。所以這年頭兒，與其生兒子，還是生女兒的來得有用。阿根，便是一個很好的例証。</p>
<h3>活人靠死人</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>上海眞是個奇怪的社會，有人靠欺詐吃飯，有人靠恫嚇吃飯，然而這還是活人掙活人的錢，“白相人”整天價蹺起腿在老虎灶上，照例穿得暖，吃得飽，其本領就“非同凡響”，其尤足怪者，莫如活人靠死人吃飯矣。</p>
<p>這次因辦理亡妻喪事，便給予我一種新的智議，至少在我是初次。</p>
<p>死人原屬最大之不幸，棺木，衣褥，錠箔……在在化錢，“人財兩空，更是不幸中的不幸。可是除掉正當棺殮費外，還有種種説不出名目的化費，這化費，到不是為死人的，却是許多活人的勒縈。</p>
<p>“家有喪事”的白紙條剛點出去，眞靈騐，立刻有一位身穿呢大衣，頭戴銅盆帽的先生跑進來，陌生人果是陌生人，却並不是來弔孝的，當我上前問明來意的時候，他很老誠的説：“本街小弟兄討點開銷。”開銷，我聽來未免奇怪，對他聲明：“朋友，我家是死了人！”而他回答得却更老誠了：“是的，我們靠山吃山，靠水吃水。”結果糊裏糊塗給一塊錢打發跑了。不料接着又來一輩“小弟兄”，又是討開銷，如是，應付至二四次之多。</p>
<p>抬棺材的夫役又開口要錢了。“統統包給你們公所裏了呵”我鄭重聲明，但無效，他們説“只要生活給你們做考究，茶錢是要叨光的。”死人躺在板上，沒法，只得照付。大殮完成，漆匠用油灰嵌棺縫，有例在先，開口要錢，説是公所裏他們只有呆工錢，全靠喪家賞幾個，話也眞够可憐，不用説，照付。</p>
<p>滿五十人的“儀仗通行證”是兩塊錢，可是“通行”還成問題，馬路上小弟兄地界要“買路錢”。到公所，有人帮點香燭，化錠，預備化給“土地”的二十串元寶早被一個老媽子搶去，好像來孝敬伊的，而結果臨走，討錢的手伸滿面前。</p>
<p>他們都是靠死人過日子的活人，在上海連“死”也不容易，眞是個奇怪的社會。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十回（素帕寄纏綿奇文鑄錯黃花對憔悴秋信添愁）</p>
<p>江太太道：照你這樣説，他倒是發了痴病了。大少奶在一邊揷嘴道：母親，你相信小菊這孩子胡説。江太太道：他倒不一定是胡説。夢蘭這孩子，口裏是滿嘴維新。可是他多病多愁的，總弄成一個林黛玉式的姑娘。自然，有些事，也讓他不順心的。不過像我們家裏豐衣足食，事事順心的人，也不應該這樣終日的愁眉不展。二少奶奶到底年輕些，心裏頭不能十分藏着話，就向江太太微笑着道：我想，也就是吃了滿口維新的虧。他那件不顺心的事，你老人家總也知道吧？江太太將桌上的水烟袋取到手上，却歎了一口氣。小菊趕快點着一根紙煤，送了過去。江太太老吸着烟，沒有答話。大少奶和二少奶正好两對面答着，這就連連丟了兩下眼色。於是這人剛可以討論的問題，又停止了。不過在這據情形之下，倒打動了二少奶一點惻隱之心。當日把話停止。次日，却同夢蘭想了一點安慰之法。這日，正是一個陰黯的天，滿空全是不分片段的陰雲。夢蘭下學回來，却見商戶上茶几上，都擺了幾盆剛開的菊花。尤其是書案上這一盆最好。乃是宜興瓷泥的小胆瓶栽的。瓶作猪肝色，紅中帶黝黑的顏色。大肚子，小小的瓶口，由那裏伸出兩莖菊花枝。左邊伸出來較長，葉子長厚古綠，左右對比，不缺少一片，頭上一朶細瓣淡黃的菊花，有小飯碗那樣大。那花瓣的細，細得像一撮絲棉，輕弱下垂着。右邊一枝，却是短短的，上面級着冬瓜棗那麼小的一個花芷。他把書包向床上一丟，拍了兩手道：好花好花，這是誰替我弄來的？小菊又是跟着上樓來的。就答道：二少奶在他娘家要來的。他説你看了這菊花，一定開心一陣，果然不錯。夢蘭伏在桌沿上，對菊花看着出了一會神，歎着氣道：還是嫂嫂是個有心人，倒送我幾盆菊花替我解悶。可是簾捲西風，人比黃花瘦，看到菊花，那是更添了我一番憔悴。小菊道；小姐，你説什麼花不好嗎？夢蘭笑道：胡説，這樣好看的花，為什麼還嫌不好。你下樓去請二少奶來，我當面謝謝他。小菊答應去了，却是很久不曾來。（一二一）</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>世界各國的週末</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>禮拜六是一週中最末後的一天，人們在一週中辛苦了六天，到了禮拜六，誰都覺得肩上輕鬆了，很愉快的盼望明天禮拜日的休息，以恢復精神肉體的疲勞。德國波斯脫雜誌乘着世界運動會各國記者羣集柏林的機會，向着各有名記者，探詢着各國週末人民的動態，成了一篇很有趣味的記載。</p>
<p>在英國禮拜六的午後，煩雜的商業情況，漸漸的稀簿冷淡了。倫敦街上便很顯著的減少了喧譁。到了禮拜日，是很莊嚴的宗敎日。各處打來的電話，已經絕口不話商業關係上的事情了。倘若污辱了此種神聖的精神，那是他平日的用心是一定十分惡劣的。此種造孽的人們，社會上將敬而遠之。禮拜日的午後，將允許着孩子們自由遊玩，同時自己也掀開了活動的序幕。到十二時為止，便不能不遵着神之命令而從事勤勞。所以不過禮拜日午後十二時，英國人是不回復他平日情緒的。</p>
<p>保加利亞禮拜六午後一時，立刻將所做的事情中止，那是成為一種道德。禮拜日是保加利亞人最幸福的一天，大都打算到朋友親戚家去訪問作客。這天最先是拜訪新婚者的甜蜜家庭。家庭裏的主婦很愉快的調製着美味的菜肴。從朝至晚很快樂的穿着像舞臺上一樣美麗的衣服。禮拜日是保國人民返老回童的一天，終日玩着孩子們能做到的運動。登山旅行的兒童團體裏，一定有成人混在一起的。冬天那末同着家庭去滑冰，是一定的習慣。</p>
<p>法國人在禮拜六的時針，到了十二時的時候，便放棄了事情回家。下午七時八時之間，一定在家庭中很忙碌的收拾整理着，這是法國人的習慣。事情終了之後，便接着商量着禮拜日的計劃，年輕的娘兒們總是提出計劃的第一人。家庭中有了年輕的娘兒，那末禮拜日的計劃，大都要採取伊的。伊不喜歡乘火車旅行，不喜歡住旅館，要到森林和湖邊去的為多。乘汽車和玩骨牌，便耗費了最大的時間。公園是曝太陽最好的地方，沒有什麼意思了。</p>
<p>野外露營生活，是波蘭禮拜日最多的計劃。因為波蘭人非常喜歡乘汽車，並且森林又多。倘若有人在禮拜日這天，不能不住在家裏的，那是最不幸者，所以連貓和狗都一同出去的。婦女們唱着歌，男子只好在旁邊靜聽着而已。</p>
<p>意大利和其他各國不同的婦女們不喜歡向外面跑，所以週末的旅行是很少的。伊們在週末都很巧妙的裝飾着家庭，女子是計劃者，男子是實行者。到了午後，招待女客，開着種種不同名稱的宴會。男子被邀了，那是認為非常欣慰的。</p>
<p>紐約土曜日正午汽笛鳴了之後，市民便紛紛作鳥獸散了，趕快討論着禮拜日閑散計劃。因此市街上靜得和墓塲一樣。平日像海底般寂靜的郊外，立刻成了豪華熱鬧的畫面。禮拜日的空氣成為美國人唯一美味的飲料，供給他們陶醉着。</p>
<h3>岳武穆與“牛”</h3>
<p>— 縱橫</p>
<p>岳武穆與牛有什麼關係呢？我説有的，講看下面的話。我們看過岳傳的，（這書在清朝被列入禁書目綠）大概都知道有一員戇大將軍呌牛皐，此人在岳傳中説是岳武穆的盟兄弟，而在正史裏則説是岳武穆的麾下部將，他是魯山人，（屬河南）字伯遠，屢破金人有功，擒楊么的戰績尤著，累官至寧國軍承宣使，也是一位民族英雄，岳武穆得到他的助力眞是不少，漢奸秦檜旣把岳武穆害死，他自然要忌着牛皐們會起來復仇，於是為一網打盡之計，暗使都統制田師中把牛皐毒死，事情是這樣的，當岳武穆死後的一日，田師中忽然大宴諸將，心田坦白的牛將軍，當然不疑有他，但酒至中巡，牛將軍竟遇毒而死，你們看漢奸們的手段，是多麼的惡毒，岳傳中説氣死金兀朮，笑死老牛皐，這是緩和讀者情緒的話，是靠不住的，牛將軍死後據説也葬在杭州西湖，可是我個人幾次的上杭州去，終沒有找到這位忠貞的民族英雄的墓，私衷常認為是件憾事，（編者按牛墓在紫霎洞下）</p>
<p>又，岳傳中有高冲挑華車一幕悲劇，這悲劇的演出地點，乃是牛頭山，山在江蘇江寧縣南，宋書禮志：“大明三年，移南郊擅於秣陵牛頭山西。”元和志：“山在縣南四十里，山有二峯，東西相對，名曰神闕，舊稱大闕。”可見這座山在軍事上是個險要的所在，史上止説岳武穆設伏敗金兀朮於此，則岳傳中所説挑華車，也許卽是此役的一個犧牲，但終於把金兀朮殺敗，又可見這幕悲劇，是有相當的代價的，此山據云有鐵鑛，鑛床露出於山頂，及其西北二坡，在山坡者鑛質尚佳，在山頂者則質稍劣，全山鑛量僅可得數萬噸，原屬大陸公司所有，後大探勘結果不佳，停止進行，（見古今地名大辭典）把埋藏的富源湮沒，也是很可惜的。</p>
<p>案以上二事，卽是我所説的岳武穆與牛的關係，因為今年生肖屬牛，國家又是正當山河破碎的時候，這位民族英雄的故事，是最值得我們稱道，所以我把他拉雜的寫出如上，以供一般人在茶餘酒後，當作一件“不無意義”的談助吧。</p>

<h3>黑子</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>一條輕便鐵道，蜿蜓地從黃葉嶺上伸展出來，直到渡馬河畔，靜靜地像兩條死了的蛇。那輛小型的煤車，忙碌地，一天到晚的在上面爬着，從鑛區里到堆棧，那短短地五六哩的路程，每一刻鐘它便能够來回一次，一籮一籮的煤塊就由它馱着，送進了堆棧，同時，又將這空籮子帶回了鑛區里。</p>
<p>一陣尖銳的汽笛呌過了之後，鑛塲里便擠出來一羣黑子，墨黑的油布衣帽上，沾滿了斑斑的水漬，臉上那一塊一塊的黑痕，遮不住生活的疲勞，雖然他們都在壯年，但在他們身上，却不會讓人們發現一點壯年人所應有的勇氣了。</p>
<p>木龍給第二次悠長的汽笛呌醒了，推開了壓在身上的破棉絮，從床上爬了起來。怱忙地穿上了那身又硬又冷的油布衣帽，跑出鑛屋來，一個呵欠從他喉嚨下面爬了起來，似乎告訴他還沒有睡足。</p>
<p>鑛屋里面的人都跑光了，下班的還沒回來，只有幾個害病的黑子，躺在舖上沉重地哼哼着。</p>
<p>“媽的，活着十個鐘頭四五毛錢，死了一口薄板棺材，黑子，眞不是人幹的！”木龍提着一盞還沒有點火的電石燈，嘴里咕嚕着向鑛窿口走去。</p>
<p>盤車的聲音軋軋軋地嚮着，鑛窿口已擠滿了人，細小的電石燈火在寒風中搖幌。下班的黑子像落湯鷄似地給盤車吊了上來，一羣一羣地，到了面上，都各自地散開了。木龍跑過去，向一個呌阿利的同伴去過亮了電石燈。</p>
<p>風刮得更緊了，工務處的屋柱子都給㨔得有點在格格地響，灰黯的天空，在飛着一片片的，鵝毛般的白絮，它飄進了鑛廊，落在黑子們的身上臉上，不久，便在他們的臉上身上化變了一粒水珠子。</p>
<p>大胖子工頭從那間給爐火薰灼得像晚春季節的辦公室里跨出表，挾緊了獺皮領的大衣，迎面吹過來一陣冷風，幾乎壓住了他剛要透出來的一口氣。</p>
<p>“天眞冷，下雪了！”他自語似地踱進了工務處，在對值班的監工講些什麼，也許是在支配下面的工作。</p>
<p>盤車頭頂的鈴聲響了，於是每一個監工都奔到了鑛窿口來，他們每人帶着八個黑子，由那輛盤車送到了一個深不可测的黑井里面。</p>
<p>黑井里冒着蒸氣。木龍跟着那監工，擠進了盤車；盤車緩緩地向黑井里沉下去，像掉在烟囱中一樣，火光幽幽地在顫動，一切聲音都給隔絕了，自己或伙伴們偶然透一口氣，或者咳一聲嗽，也會像雷鳴一般。水點子從泥壁上淋下來，彷彿屋瓦上的簷漏，都滴在他們身上。</p>
<p>盤車在地層下面停住了，鑛道上的那盞電煙火，光黃得像頹廢病患者的眼睛，小鐵道上那輛滑車，靜靜地停住在那兒。空氣寧息着，一種泥土的蒸氣充塞了全窿。幾百個黑子都陸續地到了下</p>
<h3>富麗的大厦</h3>
<p>— 望天</p>
<p>本埠四馬路河南路轉角上，聳立着一個富麗堂皇的大廈，大廈的裏面，陳設得非常華美，冷天人走進裏邊，便覺得很是和暖，忘却寒意。在那裏，你可購買各種家用良藥，各種化裝香品，各種醫療器械，各種藕菓食品，並可配各種的藥方，那裏面還設有柔軟的沙發椅，顧客可以隨意的安坐。那裏面的店員都是經過“服務訓練”，對於顧客非常的和氣，無論你購貨多少，都是一樣的殷勤招待。至於各貨的售價，並不因為設備週到而增加，反而比較別的人家都便宜。毋怪上海的人們，都歡喜到這富麗堂皇的大廈去光顧啊。（按此大廈，卽五洲大藥房。）</p>
<h3>齒白競賽</h3>
<p>— 如玉</p>
<p>十幾個兒童聚在校園裏，先生走過來問：“你們當中誰是最講衛生的？”這些兒童都爭着説他是最講衛生。先生道：“我有一個辦法，就是看誰的牙齒最白，誰就是最講衛生。”於是先生便順着次序，檢看各人的牙齒，有的帶着黑色，有的帶着黃色，結果，只有王兒的齒牙，最是潔白。先生便宣布王兒是最講衛生，很誇讚他。王兒説：“我知道牙齒是很要緊的，所以我每天仔細的刷洗它，並且我用的是五洲藥房的‘一三一牙膏，’特別有潔齒護牙的功効呢。”</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>面；大家都去分頭工作了，小工，大工，鐵匠，木匠，全由每一部份的監工督促着。木龍一班是八個人，由一個姓趙的監工率領着，向着一條深黑的鑛衖里踱去。</p>
<p>電石燈的火光在鑛衖中亮着，叮叮打打的鑿石和劈煤聲響成了一片，有時，他們伙伴之間也會斷續地發一面笑語聲，或怨恨聲，但是這些聲音全像在甏裏一樣，只響在各人的耳邊。</p>
<p>“老李，小玲正不差呢，我看她對你很有點意思。哈哈！”阿王正經地向一個瘦個子的青年説。</p>
<p>“不要説這些吧，當心監工的鞭子！”老李扮了一個鬼臉，回答着，心里却想起了那個天天在鑛屋旁邊澗上洗衣服的姑娘來。她兩天没有到澗上來了，不知什麽原故，他實在很有點惦念着她。</p>
<p>笑語聲在監工的喝下停止了，金屬器擊着煤層和石版的聲音却響得更厲害了。阿利幾次的暈眩和冒清水，但終於忍耐着，他想偷一下懶，可是那監工的鋭利眼光好像老是盯住了他。</p>
<p>時間在黑子們心里好像爬得十分慢，各人的肚子里却早已在咕嚕嚕地拉廻聲了，然而換班的汽笛還不聽得呌呢。</p>
<h3>顏面</h3>
<p>— 陸嘉</p>
<p>描繪自己的顏面，正如一個未成熟的畫家拖滯的筆觸下的深秋的荒原。</p>
<p>只因為多年的飄零，使我不僅有一個粗糙的靈魂，歲月且亦蝕盡顏面上的青春。早晨，偶而在鏡前作片時的留駐，映在鏡子裏是怎麼一個衰老的臉譜啊</p>
<p>由於顛沛的生活，前額已消失過去的豐腴與紅潤，佈滿無數深深的縱橫的皺紋，一條皺紋刻着一堆艱困和傷悲。這是因有一顆不能舒展的心，於是也有一個不能舒展的眉尖，積攢成一條條的額紋，像一條融雪後泥濘的泥路，佈着数不清的錯綜的鞭印。</p>
<p>沿了這條湫溢的道路，衰草似地生一叢枯乾的頭髮，枯燥而又蕪亂，有一些還斑白了。從前是和眼珠子一樣墨黑而有光澤的，熨貼地覆在腦門上，現在却經年沒有修整，而且我也沒有去修整的心情。</p>
<p>説到眼珠子，我還能記憶過去鑒人的光采，晶瑩的淚點，那無聲的纏綿的眼波；可是如今，一塊生滿𨻆菩的石塊安置在黯綠的死水裏似地，沒有一絲風能吹起一輪漣漪，在路旁空自望着顶上渾沌的天宇，望着四圍蒼茫的暮野。春天雪融的時候水會盈溢出來，成一條彎曲的小溪，流到遼闊的原野裏去。</p>
<p>荒涼的鼻子好似孤立的古墓，墓前衰草已經深了，可是那有祭掃的人來芟除墓草，修一修墓地呢？</p>
<p>站在墳墓的嶺上可以看到瘠瘦的斜坡度極大的田野！這是我的腮帮子。收割後的田野是空洞，寂寞的，留一些禾根和枯草，覆一層氷霜和殘雪，幾時才能得到春風的撫摩呢？</p>
<p>到這裏畫圖該算完成了，不，我還忘了我的嘴唇。這是荒原盡頭的一座古老的石洞。説起來還有一個玄虛的可是美麗的傳説隨着石洞從原始傳下來。據説石洞在從前出產晶瑩的紅玉，許多少女們冒險地到這裏採取作為胸前的佩飾。據説洞裏還居住一條赤龍，時常噴出紅色的火焰，因此許多少女們身殉了。這故事也許是眞實的，可是如今洞口已沒了赤石，只留灰緒色的岩石；再沒有赤龍吐出的火焰，只有空洞的冷風，歎息和嗚咽。</p>
<p>擲下自己的筆，再望望鏡子裏的顏面，我是有一個怎樣衰老的，和年歲不相稱的顏面啊。</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>自來水加價問題</h3>
<p>— 天羽</p>
<p>英商公共租界自來水公司，呈請工部局核準自來水加價，定於二月一日起，改為八折收費。第一特區市民聯合會等團體，已紛起反對，要求工部局鑒於市面衰落，市民負擔困難，卽予取消自來水加價之核准案。前此電話加價時，全體市民，亦會激烈反對，問題至為嚴重，但結果終於電話公司勝利了，加價照原案全部實行了。倒落得他們還傲然而言曰：加價後話機大增，足見此項加價辦法實為市民所歡迎云。看着這样的句語，我们在每次打電话时感到負擔的加重，眞有啼笑皆非之感。這次差不多性質的自來水加價問題，正在開始。其結果是否將走到電話加價問題的同一覆轍呢！這要看此次市民抗爭之方法與決心了。</p>
<p>論方法，我個人意見，以為徒事空言反對是無益的。勢必須由專案將自來水公司的經營狀況，經過一番透澈研究，有證有據的，證明自來水加價，在目前是一種反乎社會利益的行為。比如，公司所派的官息是多少，紅利若干，公司中的開交，是否超過必要程度，及遠高出上海一般市民生活之外，我們知道，電話公司請幾個電話專家，組織電話研究會，一化就幾十萬元，在所不惜，而電話加價，在所必行，到市民頭上括三分五分的電話費，以供公司的揮霍，這根本就是一個矛盾。自來水公司當然也有同樣情形。目前社會不景氣，一般的利率都在下降，獨幾個握在外商手中的血是與全體市民有切身關係的大企業：電燈，電話，自來水，電車，以至公共汽車等公司，至今仍掘强的保持其超乎一般利率之上的高利率，不顧社會之衰落，只維持少數人獨特優厚之利益，這實是一種最不合理的事情。反對自來水加價，必須集中全力，向這不合理的弱點進攻。而這却必須先有一番縝密的研究才有可能，不是粗疏忽略可以做到的。</p>
<p>只是話又説回來，上海幾個握於外商手中的獨占性企業，其經營狀況與目前社會之不相適應—這類獨占性企業本是應歸國家為謀市民福利而辦理的—這已是大家皆知道的事實。所以市民不能對這類社會性企業行使其監督權者，只為企業是在外人手中，背後尚　强力的政治力量存在。故電話加價，儘是臚舉其不合理的理由以為反對之根據，我們未嘗不理直氣壯，可是在租界當局强力支持下，也終歸失敗了。故此次反對自來水加價，是否可得最後的勝利，最要緊的關鍵是在全體市民有無堅持到底的決心！</p>

<p>電影</p>
<h3>西席地密爾偉構「亂世英傑」公映在即</h3>
<p>自從「十字軍英雄記」在滬公映後，我們已經有一年餘没有看見西席地密爾的新作品了。現在，他所導演的「亂世英雄」The　Plainsman一片，據説將於廢曆大除夕起，在大光明大戲院公映了，該片的故事，係發生在南北美戰爭後的美洲西部，那時該地土人雜居，盗賊横行，還是一種混亂的時代，於是産生了一位綽號「野蠻皮爾」的英傑，這個名字，在美國是三歳孩童都知道的，他在混亂的時世中，不顧性命，做出了一番驚天動地的事業來，這樣一個角色，由賈萊古柏飾演，當然是能盡職的，再由琪恩亞瑟配演，更是珠聯璧合。致於背景偉大，氣魄雄厚，那是地密爾作品的特長，在這部片子裏，當然也是如此的了。</p>
<h3>貂斑華同時拍三部戲</h3>
<p>貂斑華開始從事電影生活，是遠在三四年前的時候，因爲没有適當的機會，全部天才總没有暴露，但她給予人的印象却是很深刻的了，只要你一提起她的大名，該是没有人不知道的。</p>
<p>這次加入新華，她覺得異常興奮，她要求公司方面給她充分表演的機會。新華主人張善琨本來打算仍舊給她反派的角色，現在看見他有這種求進的志向，覺得她是一個值得提拔的人才，也便毅然的把「瀟湘夜雨」的女主角村女這個角色派他去擔任。</p>

<h3>通用車廠工潮始末</h3>
<p>Z&gt;影呆</p>
<p>一九三六年度的開始。美國的汽車界就遭遇了不幸事件。通用汽車公司發生了莫大的工潮。直到現在。還沒有獲到解决的辦法。在這裏。把通用公司工潮的始末。約略地為讀者報告如次。</p>
<p>㊀工潮發生美國自羅斯福當選總統而後。便以復興實業運動為標榜。以冀補救經濟危機所發生的種種問題。四年之中。表面上雖然好像各業已開始踏入復興的途徑。但資本家和勞動界中間的矛盾。並未因而減少。所以這一次羅氏雖然能够繼續當選。美國各業的工潮。却還是鬧得非常厲害。就是汽車工業方面。在一九三六年的年底。工潮早巳在醞釀之中。所以不發生者。無非為了當局的嚴加防範。力使工潮的消滅之故。然而一九三七年的開始。汽車業方面的工潮還是發生了。</p>
<p>㊁罷工人數一九三六年十二月三十一日。在美國早已有汽車工人在新年中將要大罷工的消息。所以一九三七年的元旦。美國汽車城底德律Ｄetroit就有專門為通用公司製造飛喜車身的六個工廠四個雪佛蘭分廠和其他若干工廠的工人。開始罷工。通用是美國三大車廠之一。所僱汽車工人。全廠有二十一萬一千人之多。最初加入罷工的祇有四萬人。但為了工潮的一時無法解决。所以就很疾速的擴大起來。到四日為止。屬於通用公司的大小工廠。罷工的已有七十處之多。罷工的人數。竟超過十萬以上</p>
<p>㊂所提條件工潮發生而後。所有參加罷工的工人。就都把各廠佔據。使所有工作。什麼都不能進行。同時向資方提出條件。主要的三條件是㊀增加薪水。㊁改善待遇。㊂承認集體磋商。但因為一時沒有得到廠方滿意的答復。於是就成了騎虎難下之勢。雙方一直堅持下去。</p>
<p>㊃當局重視這一次通用公司的工潮。當地的長官。對之非常重視。所以工潮發生而後。密西根當局立卽派遣大批警探。分駐所有罷工車廠的周圍。以防發生暴動事件。另一面張貼佈告。着令佔據車廠的工人。速卽離廠。力使工潮勿趨擴大。無奈工人方面。置之不理。使當局亦無可如何。除了密西根當局。就是美總統羅斯福。對於這件事情。也非常注意。深恐全美所有汽車工人。都加入這個罷工的陣綫那就更其難以解决了。</p>
<p>㊄公司損失上面説過。通用是美國的一家大車廠。所以平均每天汽車的產量。也是不少。可是自從工潮發生而後。所有規模較大的分廠。已完全入於罷工的狀態。全部工作。無法進行。祇剩一部分小廠。沒有加入罷工團體。照常在工作。但所產的汽車也是很少。不到平時產量的一半。而且就目前形勢看來。工潮的全部解决。至少要經過一個月。可知通用公司這次為罷工所遭受的損失。已是不少了。</p>
<p>㊅開始談判工潮發生而後。在工人方面。要求速卽談判。但在通用方面。以為罷工人員。佔據工廠。是違法的行為。此風不可滋長。所以堅主在工人未離工廠之前。任何談判不擬舉行。於是雙方各執一端。事情便愈鬧愈僵。直到最近。經各方的奔走調停。工人方面。才允先由佔據工廠的工人。悉行撤退。然後勞資雙方。再開談判。當筆者收集資枓。草成是文時。通用的工潮已鬧了兩個多星期。談判會决定自本星期一開始。照一般的情形看來。談判所需的時間。至少也要兩星期。所以這次通用的工潮。非一個月不能結束呢。損失的重大。也可想而知了。</p>
<h3>汽車雜訊</h3>
<p>阿斐利加汽車賽　最近皇家東斐汽車公會組織一汽車路賽。自奈羅比至强奈司堡。全程共長二七一五英里。參加汽車四十二輛。獎金自二百鎊至一千鎊不等。各駕車者頗多驚心動目之經歷。其最不幸者厥為十一號司機威司考勃氏。該氏所駕者為福特V八一輛。一路領前。超出其他汽車甚遠。及至開到距離終點僅白英里之處。忽然砰然一聲。汽車出事矣。緣有牲牛一頭。忽出而為司運之神。使此駕車者十拿九穩之錦標。一旦喪於其手。相衝結果。汽車水箱損傷頗鉅。當時卽設法另換一新水箱。繼續前進。然寶貴之時光已經失去。冠軍一席。屬諸他人。雖然如此。亞軍仍為威司考勃氏所得。</p>
<p>四萬餘英里之長途駕駛　汽車家倘能於一年之中駕駛三萬英里。則每以已達高度紀錄自詡。殊不知運貨篷車之駕駛者。其行駛總里程竟有超出此數多多者。最近蘇巴德卜許地方金鷹路奈巴氏。駕篷貨車一輛。一年之中。共駛四萬五千英里。此車為福特生五CNT篷貨年。據奈巴氏自稱。除換過一次新胎外。其唯一修理費用則為一先令六辨士而已。奈氏又云此次之里程為彼駕車二十一年中破天荒之紀錄云。</p>
<p>福特橫渡沙哈拉沙漠　最近有英人名哈羅吳頓者。夫婦二人。駕十馬力英製福特特等轎車一輛。自基尼灣奧龍至阿爾基亞司。共程三千英里。吳頓氏為阿斐利加聯合公司尼基利亞橡皮產塲之經理。此次假期返英。請得允許。准彼以汽車橫渡沙哈拉沙漠。彼夫婦二人。途中大段行程。完全無人伴送。其所取之途。亦為兩條汽車路綫中較難行之一。卽由康努（在尼基利亞北部）為起點。蜿蜓北行。經過岩石縱橫之沙漠。計長二千英里。途中尚須越過愛爾及霍加兩處之山野荒地。此路綫直至一九三三年終始有汽車通過也。有一千六百英里。可稱完全無路綫之可云。所經之處。岩口嶙嶙。隔以細沙。以石堆為標誌。沿路必需物如篷帳及汽油與水之盛器。皆裝載車中。途中有一次所携汽車。水料及食糧足敷五百英里荒蕪地境旅行之用。其載重量等於成年者七人之負量。此路非常危險。凡單獨駕駛汽車者每視之為畏途。沿路必須用無綫電每站通報云。吳頓氏此行。雖所經者皆為令人沮喪之路面。而所帶各物又如此之重。然途中比較的可稱無事。汽車從未停頓不行。機械上亦未有困難。車胎穿洞亦祇有一次耳。</p>

<h3>Fu Zuoyi Urges His Subordinates Not to Give the Enemy Another Opportunity to Invade</h3>
<p>We Must Use Popular Support and Spirit to Overcome Everything; We Will Not Determine Our Actions Based on Self-Interest</p>
<p>[Guihua] Chairman Fu's speech at the memorial week on the 1st is as follows in full:</p>
<p>Today, I have several things to report to everyone. That is, we have now obtained a "command" from bandit-puppet division commander Zhang Futang (i.e., Zhang Wanqing), which was forwarded by the First Army Headquarters of Shangdu based on a telegram from the Tanaka Agency Chief. The main two points are as follows: 1. Agency Chief Tanaka absolutely trusts you (referring to Zhang Wanqing). Generally, the state of China is such that we have an opportunity for development, and there is nothing to worry about. Strive to follow the direction indicated by a small official (small official is what Tanaka calls himself). 2. It is necessary to make subordinates thoroughly understand the major events of the overall situation in China, especially the Xi'an Incident, and explain it to them. It is necessary to strive hard, and there is the possibility of great success, and so on. After we have finished reading this order from the bandit side, we should think that the internal turmoil in our country is a good opportunity for the enemy to advance. The enemy takes advantage of our mutual disturbance of order and unrest to strive for his army. In the past, many incidents in our country have created a good opportunity for the enemy to reach out, and also created an opportunity for the enemy to invade our land and sovereignty. Now, we Chinese people should realize that the enemy comes to invade us because we first created the opportunity for the enemy. It is not entirely relying on his strength. If we do not create an opportunity for the enemy, the enemy would never dare to easily invade us. At present, we should thoroughly realize this and not give the enemy another opportunity to invade. Then the enemy will have no way and cannot invade us. When the Suiyuan Anti-Japanese War began, the people of all walks of life in Suiyuan were completely united in spirit, so they could cope with this incident. But at that time, there were a very few intellectuals who had a different view. They said that our Suiyuan's various preparations were inferior to others in every way, so instead of seeking a peaceful solution, they talked about resistance, which would inevitably lead to local chaos. This statement cannot be considered a big mistake at the time, because estimating the strength of the enemy and ourselves, we really had no certainty of victory. However, I believe that the Chinese people today should make up their minds not to determine our actions based on self-interest, but to win the final victory with a spirit of sacrifice. We are in a time of severe national crisis, and we must work to save the nation and survive. Material is not our main condition. We must use "popular support" and "spirit" to overcome everything. Before the War of Resistance, we could not predict certain victory, but we all had the determination not to be slaves of a conquered nation in our hearts, so we could disregard everything and fight the enemy to the death. Although we are not sure of winning battles when we fight the enemy, we are sure not to be slaves of a conquered nation. However, we are all sure of this because our country must perish before people perish. History tells us that this is absolutely true. We will not talk about the entire war this time. Now we will only talk about the Battle of Hongge'ertu. The Battle of Hongge'ertu started on November 15th last year. Hongge'ertu is 160 li from Taolin, 180 li from Pingdiquan, and only 60 li from the enemy's base. It is a very small place. The troops stationed there in our country were only two cavalry companies, with a population of more than 200 people, under the responsibility of Lieutenant Colonel Zhang for guarding. At the same time, the fortifications there were very simple, and the enemy suddenly launched a fierce attack on our positions on the 25th. We all know that cavalry can only move around and fight guerrillas, not defend. Defending is also unsuccessful. Moreover, at that time, our telegraph lines were also cut off by the enemy, so the news was not communicated. The enemy had 5,000 to 7,000 troops, and we had only 200 people. Compared to each other, there was a difference of dozens of times. At the same time, the enemy had artillery and aircraft to help in the battle, and we only had rifles. If we had calculated based on self-interest and considered material conditions at that time, we would not have been able to win and Hongge'ertu would not have been able to be defended. But the result was that victory belonged to us. Therefore, the Battle of Hongge'ertu was the most valuable battle of this war, and it was also our spirit of sacrifice that won the victory. At that time, the mission Lieutenant Colonel Zhang received was to guard, not to defend to the death, but he was able to achieve such results because of his spiritual strength, so he got this harvest. We must seek national rejuvenation in this spirit. The above proves that if we do not create opportunities for the enemy, we are not afraid of the enemy, and at the same time, everyone is not willing to be a slave of a conquered nation, and is determined that the country can perish but I will never be a slave of a conquered nation. We may not be sure of winning if we fight the enemy like this, but we are all sure not to be slaves of a conquered nation. With the spirit of sacrifice, we will confront the enemy, and we will definitely be able to win, because our blood can overcome the enemy's aircraft and artillery, and our fearless spirit can overcome the enemy's material. In this way, the enemy will never be able to destroy us. So I believe that the Chinese nation cannot be rejuvenated, but we must have: 1. Do not disrupt our formation and do not divide ourselves. 2. Do not seek temporary peace, but strive to become strong. 3. Do not be afraid of the enemy, do not be discouraged, and use the spirit of sacrifice to overcome everything. I hope everyone will fully contribute our physical and mental strength to the country and work together to complete the mission of rejuvenation. (2nd, Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Japanese Hayashi Cabinet</h3>
<p>— Auxiliary</p>
<p>Since General Ughaki was received on the 24th of last month to organize a cabinet. After five days of struggle, it ultimately failed due to the strong opposition from the military, who refused to recommend a successor to the Minister of the Army. On the 29th, he entered the palace to decline the mandate to organize a cabinet. After Ughaki resigned, Prince Saionji originally intended to recommend Hiranuma to organize a cabinet, but after learning that the military's opposition to Hiranuma was no less than that of Ughaki, he recommended General Hayashi Senjuro to organize a cabinet. On the evening of the 29th, the Emperor issued the order. After receiving the order, General Hayashi began to organize the cabinet, and after several contacts with various parties, he formed a new cabinet on the 1st and officially took office on the 2nd. Thus, the cabinet turmoil that had lasted for more than ten days subsided.</p>
<p>The newly established Hayashi Cabinet, no matter how one looks at it, is under the influence of the military. First, considering General Hayashi himself, he is fundamentally a soldier. He has previously held important positions such as Minister of the Army and Governor-General of Korea. During his tenure as Governor-General of Korea, the September 18th Incident occurred, and he took the liberty of deploying troops into the territory of the Northeast Provinces to serve as reinforcements for the Kwantung Army. After taking on the task of organizing the cabinet this time, the military provided him with strong support. However, General Hayashi had slightly different opinions from the military regarding the candidates for the Minister of the Army and Navy. General Hayashi intended to appoint Itagaki and Suetsugu as ministers respectively, but the previous Ministers of the Army and Navy recommended Nakamura and Yonai respectively. The result was naturally that General Hayashi gave in. At the same time, General Hayashi accepted all the conditions put forward by the military. The conditions put forward by the army were: ㊀ Fully recognize the Army Ministry's demands regarding the implementation of the national defense budget and the increase in army expenses for six consecutive years. ㊁ Implement innovation policies and other policies advocated by the previous Minister of the Army as soon as possible. The main conditions put forward by the Navy for joining the cabinet were two. First, the fundamental policy of expanding armaments in the first year without treaty restrictions and the urgent third supplementary plan budget must be implemented quickly and smoothly. Second, the unification of diplomacy. In particular, the fundamental policy of diplomacy towards China must be re-examined. General Hayashi accepted all these conditions one by one.</p>
<p>From the process of General Hayashi organizing the cabinet, the new cabinet is indeed entirely under the influence of the military. From the organizational nature of the new cabinet, it can be seen that it has already implemented the military's consistent主張(zhuzhang - position/viewpoint). We know that during the previous cabinet, the military demanded the reform of administrative institutions. In this new cabinet, except for three or four departments, most of the other departments are held concurrently. For example, Prime Minister Hayashi also serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Education, Finance Minister Ketsugi Toyotaro also serves as Minister of Colonial Affairs, Agriculture Minister Yamazaki Tatsunosuke also serves as Minister of Communications, and Railway Minister Godo Takuo also serves as Minister of Commerce and Industry. This situation is nothing less than a preliminary manifestation of the military's demand for reform of administrative institutions.</p>
<p>Since the new cabinet is entirely under the control of the military, its future policies will naturally follow the military's orders. In terms of domestic affairs, the new cabinet's statist ideology will be further tightened. Its oppression of liberalism and its economic exploitation of the general public in order to expand armaments as much as possible. In terms of foreign affairs, there is no need to mention the vigorous implementation of the continental policy. Although the appointment of Ambassador to the United States Saito Hiroshi as Minister of Foreign Affairs is intended to break the international isolation of Japan since the conclusion of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact on the one hand, it is also intended to intensify its policy of annexation towards China on the other hand. Because Saito Hiroshi, although he has served as a diplomat in Europe and the United States for many years, his views on annexing China are completely consistent with those of the military. We should still remember that when the "April 17th" Amau Doctrine was published, it caused a great backlash in Europe and the United States, but this new Minister of Foreign Affairs defended it in many ways, simply not treating China as a country.</p>
<p>Although the Hayashi Cabinet was successfully formed with the support of the military, its future is still not entirely optimistic. Because of the serious repercussions it will cause at home and abroad. In particular, China's national policy is of great importance to the fate of the Hayashi Cabinet.</p>
<h3>Mississippi River Water Continues to Rise in the United States; Military and Civilians Strive to Prevent Flooding</h3>
<p>Waves Impacting Embankments Sound Like a Thousand Drums Beating in Unison; If the Wind Does Not Stop, the Sluice Gates are in Danger of Collapse</p>
<p>Cairo, Illinois: This place is where the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers meet. The overflowing floodwaters, agitated by the wind, are impacting the banks, sounding like a thousand drums beating in unison. The superstructure of the levee is in imminent danger. The last batch of 4,500 flood control personnel are on standby. The struggle between man and nature is at its most dangerous point. The battle line stretches 1,200 miles, and there is a risk of collapse at any time. In order to provide early warning as a precaution, sentries on the levee stand at the end of the levee day and night in the bitter cold, as if facing a formidable enemy. In the event of a breach, the entire city could be submerged in 20 feet of water within minutes. Rescue boats are also standing by with fires lit in case personnel need to be evacuated in an emergency. Furthermore, the amount of water flowing from the Ohio River into the Mississippi River is approximately 3 million cubic feet per second. However, the flood control personnel are confident that the flood barrier they built is sufficient to save the city, so their morale is excellent. It is also reported that the water level in Cincinnati, Ohio, has receded. Relief workers are working to clean up the mud. However, opportunistic merchants have been discovered buying flood-damaged properties and abandoned livestock at low prices. Mr. Heberkin, the director of the Flood Disaster Committee, has been ordered to go to the disaster area for a week-long inspection. The Red Cross has raised $8.3 million of its proposed $10 million, and according to preliminary estimates, approximately 400 lives have been lost and approximately 1 million people have been left homeless in this flood. (Second-day Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Memphis: The Lower Bessie Sluice Gate, which protects Reelfoot Lake and the city of Tiptonville, is being impacted by the massive waves of the Mississippi River today and is showing signs of collapse. Army engineers have mobilized five battalions of the Civilian Conservation Corps to do their best to prevent the flooding. However, the sandbags placed on the gate have been washed away in the blink of an eye. If the wind does not stop, the sluice gate may not be able to be saved. If it collapses one day, Reelfoot Lake and three cities in western Tennessee will be completely submerged. Tiptonville will also be affected. There are many disaster victims there. The government has prepared several barges capable of holding thousands of people to prevent emergencies. The army is densely stationed along the river from Cairo to the mouth of the Arkansas River, and at the command, flood control personnel will be ordered to retreat. There are now 100,000 people working on the embankments. The water in Louisville has receded, and some stores have resumed business. (First-day Guomin News dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Maritime Workers' Strike Ends</h3>
<p>Preliminary Voting Results Show Majority Favor Returning to Work; It Will Take at Least One Month to Restore Maritime Transport to Its Original State; Estimated Strike Losses Reach $81 Million</p>
<p>[Washington] The months-long strike of maritime workers on the Pacific coast has been officially declared over, according to an official announcement. (First-day Havas Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] Union leaders announced today that the earliest reports from the Pacific Coast Maritime Workers' Union's vote on the terms of settling the strike indicate that a majority favor returning to work immediately. (First-day Guomin News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] Although maritime unions are secretly seeking the opinions of their members on returning to work, reports from various sources indicate that the majority favor returning to work. Therefore, shipping companies have convened their staff to prepare to start working. Strike leader Bridges said that if the voting procedures can be completed by noon on Wednesday, work can be resumed on Thursday, and the first batch of ships that have been berthed for a long time can also set sail on Thursday or Friday. However, it will take at least one month for maritime transport on the Pacific coast to return to its original state. The Chamber of Commerce estimated today that the losses from this strike will reach as high as $81.7 million. (First-day Guomin News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fighting Breaks Out in US Auto Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>Michigan Governor Mobilizes Troops to Suppress</p>
<p>Flint, Michigan: Fighting broke out in the Chevrolet Motor Plant here, involving 300 workers. Before the fighting, the workers held a meeting and announced that one union member had been expelled. During the fighting, several shots were fired, and workers outside the factory smashed some of the factory building's windows with sticks. Today, General Motors has petitioned the authorities to evict the "sit-down strike" workers from the company's two plants. After a four-hour court hearing, the judge announced that the verdict would be given tomorrow, as the court wants to wait for the union to present reasons for not evicting them and does not want to act rashly. According to the company, the strikers occupying the plant are no longer employed by the company, and nearly 80% of the 135,000 unemployed workers are willing to return to work. The strikers occupying the plant are still being supplied with heat and water by the factory, and their food is delivered by those sympathetic to the strike. Those who violate the strike rules are tried and punished by a court organized by the workers inside the factory. Those who have committed offenses are punished by serving as extra patrol members and doing hard labor such as sweeping. (First-day Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Flint: The authorities have mobilized 1,200 troops to monitor the area outside the General Motors factory, where striking workers are occupying the plant. Upon hearing the news, the wives, sisters, and girlfriends of the workers have also formed a women's team, wearing red beanies, armbands in red and white, and holding clubs. When the troops take any action, they will come forward to protect the striking workers and persist to the end. They have no firearms and are currently searching for gas masks to defend against tear gas. (First-day Havas Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Flint: The 3,000 night-shift workers at the Chevrolet No. 4 plant have gone on strike. The factory building is now surrounded by 1,200 guards, who intend to force the striking workers to surrender. However, the striking workers are staying in the factory and are also showing no signs of weakness, threatening to destroy the factory's contents and burn them for warmth. Strike leaders are now planning to form a women's emergency team to forcibly deliver food to the trapped workers in the Chevrolet factory. (Third-day Guomin News dispatch)</p>

<h3>Pope's Condition Improving</h3>
<p>Vatican City – The Pope is now receiving audiences again, proving that his condition has indeed improved. However, the number of people received is currently less than in the past. The Pope has decided to hold a ceremony to bestow blessed golden roses on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Italian Queen on March 7th. This is also proof that his health is improving. Today, the Pope asked those around him whether the people of the Vatican had discussed holding a conclave to elect a new pope. Those around him replied that they had not. The Pope then said that whether or not to hold such an event is not for him or them to decide, but rests entirely with God. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Thirteen Soviet Russian Party Prison Defendants Before Execution</h3>
<p>Pyatakov Cried Out, Begging to See His Wife One Last Time. The Rest Generously Faced Execution, Crying Out That Radek Had Sold His Friends.</p>
<p>[Paris] The Paris Evening News recently published a report from a correspondent in Riga, confirming the rumor that Lenin's wife had been arrested. It also stated that the third trial of the Trotskyite counter-revolutionaries will open in April. As for the thirteen defendants sentenced to death in the "Parallel Center" case, they were executed last night in the prison courtyard of the Moscow Political Police Bureau. The execution was carried out by sixteen soldiers, commanded by a Latvian named Peterson, who has a beard. He is known externally as the "Bearded Executioner." Previously, each of the defendants had requested amnesty from the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee. The Presidium organized a committee to study and discuss the requests for three hours. Several committee members favored amnesty, and Chief Prosecutor Vyshinsky reportedly believed that since the main defendants in the case, such as Radek, had been spared death, there was no reason to execute the other defendants. However, Stalin was resolute and could not be swayed. The Presidium ultimately rejected the request for amnesty. Before the execution, Vyshinsky felt unwell and therefore did not participate, leaving the prison beforehand. Among the thirteen defendants, Pyatakov cried out loud before the execution and asked to see his wife one last time. The prison historian told him that she was not in Moscow. Geslavsky, on the other hand, was mentally disturbed. There was no place to tie him up in the prison courtyard, so they had to place him on the ground and shoot him. The other defendants generously faced execution, without any fear, and shook hands with each other to say goodbye. One of them cried out, "Radek and Sokolnikov are traitors who sold their friends!" The corpses of the thirteen defendants were immediately loaded onto hearses and buried in a common pit. Thus, the Parallel Center case came to an end. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Radek Spared from Death</h3>
<p>Due to Clever Defense</p>
<p>[Paris] The verdict in the Moscow "Parallel Center" case resulted in one of the defendants, Radek, the former chief writer of Pravda, being spared from death. The local "Business News" recently commented on this, stating that Radek's survival was due to his clever defense. According to his confession, there were aspects of the Trotskyite secret activities that were not known to the outside world. He knew them well. When he met with a certain German diplomat in a villa, Bukharin, the former chief writer of Izvestia, was also present and also knew about them. The Supreme Court likely believed that because the third Trotskyite case was about to open, and Bukharin and Rykov, the former Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, were both implicated, Radek could provide powerful testimony. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Activity by Secret Police</h3>
<p>Nearly a Hundred People Implicated in Party Prison Case</p>
<p>Warsaw – Pyotr Pavlov, who ordered the execution of the Russian Tsar and his family, has been arrested. Uglanov, who, along with Bukharin and Rykov, was a leader of the "Right Opposition," has recently been arrested by the secret police. Pirogov and Uglanov were both considered to have participated in a conspiracy against Stalin in the Trotskyite reaction case, and the Soviet press is demanding that they be sentenced to the extreme penalty. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>[Paris] According to reports in the local newspapers, Bronstein, the manager of the Baltic Shipping Company in Leningrad, has been arrested by the secret police. Bronstein is a relative of Trotsky. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>[London] A correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph" reports that the "confessions" of the defendants in the Moscow Trotskyite reaction case implicate approximately one hundred people. It is widely believed that these one hundred people have all been arrested, but it is not yet known whether there will be a public trial. The "Daily Herald" has learned that Radek and Sokolnikov may have to be questioned along with Bukharin and Rykov, and other "Trotskyites," based on new evidence. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Of Lenin's Circle, Only Stalin Remains</h3>
<p>[Moscow] A local workers' pamphlet recently published states that of the members of the Communist Party Politburo at the time of Lenin's death, only Stalin is still free. Of the other six, Zinoviev and Kamenev have been executed, Tomsky committed suicide half a year ago, Rykov and Bukharin have been arrested, and Trotsky has fled abroad. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>

<h3>The Hayashi Cabinet Officially Takes Office, Only Eight Ministers</h3>
<p>And Each Harboring Different Dreams, the Future is Fraught with Difficulties. The Seiyukai and Minseito Parties Refuse to Participate.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] General Hayashi entered the Imperial Palace at 9:30 this morning to present the list of cabinet members to the Emperor. After exiting the Imperial Presence, the Emperor immediately held an appointment ceremony. General Hayashi and the other cabinet members, dressed in formal attire, entered the palace. The Emperor, dressed in ordinary formal attire, personally attended the Phoenix Room at 10:25 am. Naval Minister Nagano stood in attendance. The Emperor bestowed an imperial edict, appointing Army General Hayashi Senjuro as Prime Minister, concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Education. Minister Nagano presented him with the official appointment document. Then, at 11:30 am, with Prime Minister Hayashi in attendance, the appointment ceremony for the other cabinet members was held. Thus, the Hayashi Cabinet was officially established. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The peculiarities of the Hayashi Cabinet are noteworthy, generally as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ The Prime Minister concurrently holds the posts of Foreign Minister and Education Minister, and many of the provincial ministers also hold concurrent posts. The entire cabinet consists of only eight members.</p>
<p>㊁ Chuu Ouchi of the Seiyukai and Yanetaro Mizui of the Minseito have both refused to join the cabinet, so it is completely isolated from both the Seiyu and Minsei parties.</p>
<p>㊂ In selecting the successor to the Army Minister, the initial policy of forming a cabinet was abandoned, so that the representative figure of the benchmark reform faction, Shinji Sogo, withdrew midway, and only then was it possible to complete the cabinet formation.</p>
<p>㊃ Therefore, the new cabinet's political program is nothing more than a list of extremely commonplace words. Its essence is no different from the Saito, Okada, and Hirota cabinets. It could even be said that its sense of reform is a step backward compared to the Hirota cabinet. Moreover, the Hayashi cabinet's relationship with the military and with the political parties contains many hidden dangers, and its future is even more noteworthy.</p>
<p>As for the issue of recommending the Army Minister, in the future, it will inevitably increase the degree of internal conflict. Regarding its relationship with the political parties, although it is currently threatened by the atmosphere of dissolution, if it is inevitable to the point of dissolution, then the political parties will definitely decide to adopt a counter-offensive attitude. The Hayashi cabinet, which is completely isolated from the Seiyu and Minsei parties, is difficult to predict how it will respond. Some people say that it may try to work with the Seiyu and Minsei parties and plan to establish a new political party. However, it is very doubtful whether the political parties will make every effort to organize a party organization for the current cabinet, which has no party members as ministers. Also, because the number of cabinet members is very small, the control within the cabinet is relatively easy. Looking at the list of cabinet members, it is immediately clear that it is a motley crew, lacking a central collective. If it is considered as a cabinet to deal with the current major and difficult situation, it is suspected of lacking vigor. Therefore, the general public anticipates that it will inevitably have a short life. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi met with a group of reporters at the Prime Minister's official residence at 2:00 pm on the 2nd and gave a speech saying that he had been ordered to form a cabinet at this extraordinary time. To stabilize the people's hearts and develop the country's strength, he must have extraordinary determination. He will do his best to repay the country, and he hopes that everyone will spare no effort to help him. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Various Current Problems</h3>
<p>Dealing with the Parliament and Revising the Budget. Oohashi Confers with the Speakers of Both Houses.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After returning home from the cabinet formation headquarters last night, the new Finance Minister, Toyotaro Yuki, told reporters that the issue of party members joining the cabinet could be resolved tonight. Their withdrawal from the political parties is not a necessary condition, but a matter of their own will. The new cabinet hopes that the political parties will assist in the issue of whether or not to dissolve the parliament, which should be decided after the appointment ceremony is completed. If the parliament is not dissolved, the budget bill submitted during the Hirota cabinet will be withdrawn by the parliament, and the new cabinet will resubmit it to the parliament. Whether or not to amend it at that time can be decided after the appointment ceremony. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After the establishment of the Hayashi Cabinet, the issue of whether or not to dissolve the parliament is the focus of attention from all parties. However, since the current government is not only not actively opposed to the cabinet by the Seiyu and Minsei parties, but rather indicates that it will use a principle of right and wrong to pass the budget bill, the initial approach is not to deal with the parliament with a policy of dissolution. Depending on the situation in the parliamentary arena, measures will be taken as appropriate. However, the new Finance Minister, Yuki, will make some revisions to the financial and economic policies of the former Finance Minister, Maba. Therefore, there is a need for the parliament to temporarily suspend or even adjourn. The Chief Secretary, Oohashi, held a long discussion with the Chief Secretaries of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives on the afternoon of the 2nd. In general, even if the parliament reconvenes on the 3rd, the government will not request a suspension. According to the decision of the negotiating committees of each faction of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, the adjournment will continue. The Chief Secretaries of both houses have requested understanding from both houses. The adjournment is scheduled to be approximately ten days from the 3rd. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The emergence of the Hayashi Cabinet and the issue of the immediate dissolution of the 70th Diet are the most important events of concern in various aspects of the political world. Moreover, how the results will be determined is an important key to determining the future political situation, which has aroused the attention of the general public. When Mitsumasa Yonai took office as Naval Minister, he put forward his cabinet conditions, and regarding the fundamental policy of expanding armaments after the first year of the non-treaty period, especially the implementation of the third supplementary plan, he has obtained the understanding and approval of General Hayashi. This third supplementary plan requires rapid and smooth implementation. If the budget for the Showa 12th year, which is based on the funding for this plan, is successfully passed in the Diet, the implementation period will inevitably be delayed compared to the naval plans of Britain and the United States due to the fiscal year relationship. The naval authorities do not approve of the immediate dissolution of the 70th Diet for this reason. Therefore, when the issue of Diet dissolution is a topic of discussion at the Hayashi Cabinet's cabinet meeting, the new Naval Minister, Yonai, will definitely express his beliefs and express the views of the Navy, hoping that the new cabinet will handle the Diet issue with a prudent attitude. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Seiyukai Criticizes the Cabinet</h3>
<p>Saying It Submits to Army Blackmail</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Secretary-General of the Seiyukai, Mr. Ando, ​​issued a statement as follows: The announcement of the establishment of the Hayashi Cabinet temporarily stabilizes the political situation, which is gratifying. Our party takes the country as its foundation, and will use strict principles of right and wrong to review the policies of the new cabinet. We hereby declare this. However, the Hayashi Cabinet considers the power of the political parties and follows the blackmail of the army to exclude the political parties. This means that Prime Minister Hayashi does not have a firm and unswerving policy, and it is also felt that his cabinet is a weakling from birth. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Minseito Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Attitude Toward the New Cabinet Determined in the Parliament</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the establishment of the Hayashi Cabinet, the Minseito Party issued a statement on the 2nd in the form of a speech by its Secretary-General, Nagai, as follows: Prime Minister Hayashi, with his loyal, resolute personality and experience, is able to handle the heavy responsibility of dealing with the general situation during this major period of reform. The new cabinet must recognize the importance of the current situation and overcome the difficulties together with the national people. We should also assist the new cabinet from the perspective of the country, and at the same time realize the mission of national survival, stabilize the people's hearts, and do our best to contribute. Recently, the new cabinet has issued its political program. Our party will also decide its attitude towards the new cabinet at that time, and meet in the parliament. (Domei News Agency, 1st)</p>
<h3>Army and Navy Ministers Issue Statements</h3>
<p>Each Implementing Fixed Policies</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After the first cabinet meeting, the new Army Minister, Nakamura, told reporters that at this time of great importance, he was appointed to the important military and administrative post, and he deeply felt the weight of his responsibility. The former Army Minister made it his mission to rectify military discipline, enrich national defense, and rejuvenate the administration. He believed that this was also his mission, and he would do his best to realize it. The whole country should recognize the importance of the situation, cooperate to overcome the difficulties, and support the imperial destiny. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After the first cabinet meeting, Naval Minister Yonai said as follows: At this time of great importance in internal and external affairs, he received the great command and assumed the heavy responsibility of Naval Minister. He would serve the public with utmost sincerity, and with a fresh spirit, lead his department to be loyal and answer the sacred command, and live up to the expectations of the people. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Hayashi Cabinet's First Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>Only Ten Minutes Before Dissolving. Formal Agenda This Morning.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The first cabinet meeting of the new Hayashi Cabinet was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at noon on the 2nd. All cabinet members, including Prime Minister Hayashi, attended. The Prime Minister delivered a speech on the formation of the cabinet, and it was decided that all cabinet members would cooperate. Then, the following important personnel matters were decided. The meeting adjourned after only ten minutes. It was decided to hold a formal cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 am on the 3rd to discuss the aftermath of the Diet dissolution issue and the policy towards the Diet. The important personnel matters decided at the cabinet meeting today were: Hachiro Oohashi was appointed as Chief Cabinet Secretary concurrently Director-General of the Cabinet Investigation Bureau; Shotaro Ishiwatari, Cabinet Investigator, was relieved of his post as Acting Director-General of the Cabinet Investigation Bureau; and Kanesuke Kaya, Director of the Financial Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, was appointed as Vice-Minister of Finance. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The list of the Hayashi Cabinet is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of Education: Hayashi Senjuro</p>
<p>Minister of Home Affairs: Kakichi Kawarada</p>
<p>Minister of Finance and Minister of Colonial Affairs: Toyotaro Yuki</p>
<p>Minister of the Army: Kotaro Nakamura</p>
<p>Minister of the Navy: Mitsumasa Yonai</p>
<p>Minister of Justice: Suehiko Shiono</p>
<p>Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, concurrently Minister of Communications: Tatsunosuke Yamazaki</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce and Industry, concurrently Minister of Railways: Takuzo Gotho</p>
<p>Chief Cabinet Secretary: Hachiro Oohashi</p>
<p>Director-General of the Legislation Bureau: Takeo Kawagoe</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Takuzo Gotho, President of Showa Steel Works, has agreed to assume the post of Minister of Commerce and Industry and concurrently Minister of Railways.</p>
<p>Tatsunosuke Yamazaki was invited by General Hayashi to assume the post of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry at 11:40 pm on the 1st and immediately agreed. General Hayashi also entrusted Toyotaro Yuki to negotiate with Baron Yorinori Arima, a member of the House of Peers, to join the cabinet, but Arima refused.</p>
<p>Tatsunosuke Yamazaki of the Showakai immediately announced his withdrawal from the party after promising General Hayashi to assume the post of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry last night. Judging from Yamazaki's political activities to date, Yamazaki will definitely be an important protagonist in the new political party establishment movement, and at the time of the establishment of the new party, several members of the Showakai will take the same action as Yamazaki.</p>
<p>General Hayashi is currently negotiating with Harumichi Tanabe, a member of the Advisory Council of "Manchukuo," to assume the post of Minister of Communications, but because Tanabe is an official of "Manchukuo," the procedures will take a considerable amount of time, so he cannot attend the appointment ceremony on the 2nd. Tatsunosuke Yamazaki will concurrently serve as Acting Minister of Communications and attend the appointment ceremony.</p>
<p>The appointment of the successor to the Vice-Minister of Finance was decided at the cabinet meeting on the 2nd, and Kanesuke Kaya, Director of the Financial Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, was promoted to fill the vacancy.</p>
<p>After the appointment ceremony of the new cabinet was completed, Tetsuichi Terauchi was immediately appointed as a Military Councilor, Osamu Nagano as Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet and Commander-in-Chief of the First Fleet, and the new Army Minister, Nakamura, was concurrently appointed as Director-General of the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs.

<h3>Marquis Nagashige Asano, Contributor to the Meiji Restoration, Passes Away</h3>
<p>One of the Seven Loyal Clans</p>
<p>Hiroshima – Marquis Nagashige Asano, the lord of Hiroshima Domain and a contributor to the Meiji Restoration, was 96 years old this year. He had been receiving treatment at his home for senile asthma since the 12th of this month. His condition deteriorated on the evening of the 1st, and he passed away at 8:10 pm. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Hiroshima – Marquis Nagashige Asano was born in the 13th year of the Tempo era. In the 5th year of the Ansei era, he became the adopted son of Nagayoshi Asano. In the 2nd year of the Meiji era, he inherited the fiefdom and was transferred to the position of Lord of Aki. At the time of the Meiji Restoration, he obeyed the imperial order and supported the military administration and the great cause of the restoration of the monarchy. At that time, he was one of the seven loyal clans, fought in various places, and made great contributions. Later, he served as a member of the Imperial Court, President of Accounting Affairs, Governor of Hiroshima Prefecture, a member of the Senate, and a minister to Italy. In the 17th year of the Meiji era, he received the title of Marquis and was appointed as a court official of the Ministry of the Imperial Household and Chief of the Peerage Bureau. In the 30th year of the Meiji era, he was appointed as an official of the House of Peers. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Analysis of the Hayashi Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Hayashi Cabinet, after many twists and turns, officially took office this morning. Counting back from the resignation of the Hirota Cabinet on the afternoon of January 23, it has been ten days. In Japanese history, it is not too long to spend ten days organizing a new cabinet. In fact, Hayashi spent only three days organizing the cabinet, so its success was quite rapid. Among the members of the new cabinet, aside from the Army and Navy Ministers, Toyotaro Yuki occupies the most important position. The rest of the cabinet members are all second or third-rate figures. The movement to organize a new cabinet was first thwarted by the issue of the Minister of National Defense, and then encountered setbacks because Nakajima and Nagai refused to accept Hayashi's conditions for withdrawing from their parties. The fact that the Hayashi Cabinet is completely unrelated to the political parties is, in a sense, quite important compared to the Hirota Cabinet, in which the party members were merely companions at the ministerial conference table. This kind of cabinet can exempt itself from the criticism of playing with political parties, and it can also prevent the political parties from bearing the empty name of government parties, since they should not actually have this empty name. At present, both the Seiyu and Minsei parties maintain a neutral attitude, watching the new cabinet's policies in order to prepare appropriate strategies. Shinji Sogo's withdrawal from the cabinet midway during Hayashi's cabinet formation can symbolize that the new cabinet has shifted from "radicalism" to "gradualism." Although the new cabinet is a middle-of-the-road cabinet, it shares the same purpose as the Saito, Okada, and Hirota cabinets, but there are slight differences between the two. The Hayashi Cabinet is based on the cooperation of the military cliques, bureaucrats, and zaibatsu, while the Hirota Cabinet was a cabinet of cooperation between the military cliques, bureaucrats, and political parties. Hayashi announced the new cabinet's plans yesterday, including ㊀ gradual reform policies, ㊁ efforts to establish diplomatic policies, and ㊂ respect for constitutional government. The middle-ranking officers of the army are difficult to satisfy with the so-called gradual reform policy, and it is predicted that friction may occur between the new cabinet and the middle-ranking officers of the army. When establishing diplomatic policies, it is also questionable whether the new cabinet has sufficient power to control various aspects of Japanese diplomatic activities. Furthermore, regarding the so-called "respect for constitutional government," since there are different interpretations, how to use concrete policies to harmonize the various divergent interpretations and concepts to avoid conflict is the most difficult of all the problems. The difference in opinions between the army and navy makes the problem even more complex. This complex relationship has affected the issue of dissolving the Diet. Therefore, before implementing the new policies, Hayashi will encounter various difficulties when the cabinet is established to unify the opinions within the cabinet. This is why the future of the new cabinet is not optimistic. (Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Communications Five-Year Plan</h3>
<p>Allocates 15 Million Yen</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of Communications has adopted a five-year plan to increase the tonnage of merchant ships over 100 tons. It plans to increase the existing 4,216,000 tons to 6,000,000 tons within five years. The method is for the government to allocate 15 million yen to subsidize deep-sea liners and cargo ships, mainly non-scheduled vessels. Japan ranks third among the world's maritime nations today, but the development of foreign trade has made its existing vessels insufficient. The Japanese shipbuilding industry is now showing a prosperity not seen since 1919, and the enthusiasm for ordering ships has even exceeded supply. This phenomenon is surprising because in the past few years, Japanese shipping has suffered various disadvantages in Europe, Australia, and the Atlantic, and has had to concentrate its strength in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. In 1934, a total of 48 Japanese ships sailed the Atlantic, totaling 450,000 tons, but by 1936, this had decreased to 33 ships. Japanese shipping has also suffered similar setbacks in European waters. In 1932, a total of 69 Japanese ships sailed to Europe, totaling 630,000 tons, but today there are only 16 ships totaling 170,000 tons. The Japanese Ministry of Communications has now slightly changed its policy. For the issuance of subsidies, non-scheduled vessels will receive the same treatment as scheduled liners.

<h3>Hitler's Speech Attacked by Russian Newspaper</h3>
<p>Believing Britain and France are Cowardly, Hand Extended in Vain</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Izvestia newspaper commented on Hitler's speech, saying, "Hitler has resolutely declared that everything remains the same as before. Britain and France extended their hands to Germany, but their hands remained suspended in the air for a long time. Of course, this result is not so much a tragedy for peace in Europe, but rather a tragic blow to the dignity of those gentlemen who have been openly insulted by Hitler in essence. In short, the world can only thank Hitler, because he has made the current situation completely clear. The essence of the current problem is whether collective strength can be used to stop the fascist aggressors before they plunge the world into catastrophe. Peace in Europe depends on this. As for the path chosen by Britain and France, which is to courteously guide Germany, it will never achieve this goal. The focus of the entire fascist agenda is economic and political expansion, mad military expansion and war. Fascism must abandon this agenda only after realizing that its tricks of isolating and threatening individual peaceful countries, which are now being invaded by Germany in stages, are not successful and have no hope of success. Fascism must abandon this aggression only after understanding that it will face immediate united and severe blows from peaceful countries. If Hitler is forced to reach this understanding, he may hesitate to stop blindly advancing towards the prospect of European and world war. However, have Britain and France ever really taken any measures to prevent Germany from taking this path? Have the bloody adventures of German and Italian fascism in Spain ever been seriously stopped? Has the position taken by Germany against the peaceful and democratic Czechoslovakia, which is absolutely intolerable from the perspective of European peace, ever encountered organized and normal blows? Can Britain's policy truly make Hitler realize that Britain is truly prepared to uphold a collective peace organization? To these questions, we must answer no. However, if Britain and France, especially Britain, continue to waver, if they continue to respond to fascist actions with empty talk, and their empty talk is neither frank nor affirmative, then if we consider Hitler's intelligence, the result will always be disappointment."

<h3>Disarmament Bureau Scheduled to Meet</h3>
<p>May 6th</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons met this afternoon, and Foreign Secretary Eden mentioned the issue of disarmament, stating that the Council of the League of Nations has now decided to convene the Bureau of the Disarmament Conference in Geneva on May 6th. As for the agenda, it will be decided by the Bureau itself during the meeting, and it is not yet known at this time. He also stated that the British government is still prepared to re-engage in negotiations with Germany in the hope of achieving universal disarmament. At this point, Labour MP Henderson asked the Foreign Secretary, "Germany withdrew from the Disarmament Conference in 1933 because it failed to obtain equal rights in armaments. Now that Germany's armaments have reached an equal footing with other countries, does the British government intend to invite Germany to rejoin the Disarmament Conference?" The Foreign Secretary replied, "Britain would be extremely pleased if Germany could rejoin the disarmament efforts. The members of the House surely understand this intention," and so on. Henderson then questioned the Foreign Secretary about Germany's activities in Spanish Morocco. The Foreign Secretary replied that British representatives had conducted an investigation in Spanish Morocco, and the results did not prove that Germany had violated any treaties signed by Britain. As for the authorities in Melilla, Spanish Morocco, prohibiting British investigators from inspecting the airfield there, it is understood that such prohibitions are standard regulations. Since the British investigators did not specifically request to inspect the airfield, the authorities in Melilla did not specifically refuse them either. Regarding the current negotiations between Germany and Portugal and whether this issue conflicts with the obligations arising from the current treaties between Britain and Portugal, the Foreign Secretary declared, "The Portuguese government has already issued a communiqué denying the rumors, so the obligations arising from the current treaties between Britain and Portugal do not seem to be affected."</p>
<h3>French Air Force</h3>
<p>1,500 First-Line Aircraft</p>
<p>[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies continued to debate national defense issues today. Aviation Minister Cot explained the current state of the French Air Force, saying, "Although our country's inventors and manufacturers once lagged behind their foreign counterparts, they have since quickly caught up and restored their original position. Our Air Force has also become one of the most powerful in the world. To my knowledge, among the air forces of the world, only the Soviet Union has machinery superior to ours. However, the excellence of our Air Force's machinery can still bring glory to the nation. As for the exact number of aircraft we have, I am afraid I cannot disclose it. But if others talk to you about our Air Force's machinery, I hope you will be cautious and not believe it lightly. Among the total number of aircraft, there are those that can immediately take off to engage in battle, and these should not be confused with other aircraft. Some say that our country has a total of 1,500 aircraft. This refers to first-line aircraft, not that the total number is only 1,500. We have been intensifying our work in aviation for the past six months, to an extent that other countries cannot match. The number of first-line aircraft has increased by 37 percent, the ammunition used by the Air Force has increased by 50 percent, the weaponry has increased by 70 percent, and several bases have been built. As for the morale, that is another matter." (A Havas dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Spanish Government Centralizes Command</h3>
<p>Preventing Extremist Activities</p>
<p>Valencia The remaining members of the Spanish Parliament today unanimously voted to grant dictatorial powers to the cabinet of leader Gabarillo, allowing him to engage in war and suspend parliamentary sessions indefinitely. According to Gabarillo, the purpose of this decision is to centralize command power and prevent the activities of extremists. Gabarillo is the Secretary-General of the Spanish Workers' Union and the leader of the Socialist Party, and he served as Minister of Labor before forming a cabinet on September 4th of last year, assuming the positions of Prime Minister and Minister of War.

<h3>Liu Weichi, Director of the Guangdong Construction Department, Discusses Impressions of the Eastern Tour</h3>
<p>Traveled Over 3,000 Li of Highways, Impressions Gained from Personal Observation are Very Good, Economic Conditions in the Chaozhou Region are the Best</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication, Liu Weichi, Director of the Construction Department, departed on January 23rd to inspect the various counties in the eastern region, and has now completed the tour. On the evening of the 28th, he returned to the province by express train on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. On the morning of the 29th, he attended the provincial government meeting and then went to the department office. According to Director Liu, the itinerary of this inspection is as follows:</p>
<p>I have been in charge of the Construction Department for several months, and I had long planned to tour the various counties to inspect the local transportation situation and economic conditions. However, due to the busy departmental affairs, I was occupied with organizing matters, so the trip was delayed. Now that matters have been largely organized and are progressing in an orderly manner with considerable progress, I have taken the time to tour and inspect the various counties and cities. The first step was to inspect the eastern region, followed by the southern region and Qiongya. This inspection of the eastern region followed the eastern route trunk line. Departing from Guangzhou, I first arrived at Zengcheng, then proceeded through Boluo, Huiyang, Haifeng, Chaoyang, and reached Shantou. From Shantou, I transferred to Chaoan, Jieyang, Fengshun, Meixian, Xingning, Wuhua, Zijin, and Huizhou, and finally arrived at Zhangmutou, where I took the train back to the province. In this week, I traveled approximately 3,000 li. The impressions gained from the observation along the way are very good. The objectives of the inspection were: first, to check the highways.</p>
<p>Eastern Region Highways</p>
<p>Apart from the provincial highways, those in Huizhou and Chaozhou-Meizhou are relatively developed. Currently, in terms of road surface, the Puning-Shantou, Shantou-Zhangmutou, Chaozhou-Jieyang, and Meixian attached sections, as well as the Huizhou suburban sections, are very complete and can be compared to the best highways in other provinces. In addition, the road surfaces of other highways are mostly uneven, some damaged by rainwater, and some caused by overloaded vehicles. This is because the soil used for the roadbeds in the eastern region is not as good as the soil in the southern region, which has better cohesive properties, so it is easily damaged. I have now ordered the person in charge of the Eastern Route Traffic Department and the various county governments, along with the privately operated transportation companies, to pay special attention to repairs. At the same time, there are too few trees planted along the roads. Apart from the aforementioned better sections that have trees planted, there are no trees planted elsewhere. The reasons for this are twofold: ㊀ Some parts do not have enough rainfall, so the trees do not grow even when planted. ㊁ Some parts are destroyed arbitrarily by the villagers who do not know how to cherish them. I have now ordered special attention to be paid to increasing the planting of trees along the roads. Regarding bridges, apart from those already built with reinforced concrete, which are still complete, many other temporary wooden bridges have been damaged due to long-term maintenance or weak construction materials. These road bridges are extremely important for freight and passenger transportation during normal times. The fundamental solution is for the government to raise a large sum of money to rebuild the wooden bridges with reinforced concrete foundations so that they can last permanently. However, due to the limited financial resources of the government, it is not possible to do this all at once, so it must be implemented in two steps: first, to improve all the wooden bridges, and then to rebuild the important ones with reinforced concrete. Secondly, regarding the</p>
<p>Traffic Situation</p>
<p>Traffic on the highways in this province is divided into two types: one is provincial highways, which are operated by the government, and the other is county highways, which are mostly privately operated. Because the county highways were built by the people themselves raising funds, the traffic rights are also handed over to the people. Because the traffic rights are divided between the government and the people, the management is also inconsistent. Often, there is a lack of coordination between the provincial highway traffic and the county highway traffic, which greatly hinders traffic. The improvement plan in the future is to ensure that the provincial highway traffic and the county highway traffic are effectively coordinated and that an accurate timetable is set to facilitate the travel of merchants. I have now ordered the relevant personnel of this department to carefully plan and handle this matter. As for the vehicles used on the highways, those purchased by private operators are still relatively clean, but most of the others are old and dilapidated. The vehicles used for provincial highway traffic are mostly old and worn out because they have reached their service life. I have now ordered the Chelu Traffic Department to add new vehicles to improve the situation. It is estimated that the first batch of ten vehicles has been finalized and can be installed and used in one and a half months. Another ten vehicles will be purchased in the first batch and exchanged in succession. However, the profits from Eastern Route traffic are limited. During normal times, it is only enough to maintain the status quo. If the vehicles are completely replaced, the burden will be very heavy. However, it is hoped that after the improvement, merchants will be happy to ride, and the business will improve, which can offset the costs. Furthermore, regarding the economic conditions of the various regions.</p>
<p>Economic Situation</p>
<p>The economic situation in the eastern region is best in Chaozhou, followed by Meizhou, and then Huizhou. The largest products of Chaozhou are cane sugar. Last year, the cane sugar alone was worth about 17 or 18 million yuan. Next is citrus fruit, which is worth over one million yuan per year. Next are drawnwork and pottery, which are also produced in large quantities. In addition, there are remittances from overseas Chinese, which amount to tens of millions of yuan per year. In recent years, due to the impact of the world's economic downturn, remittances from overseas Chinese have decreased, and production has also been slow. However, things have gradually improved last year, and the situation in the future will definitely be promising. Regarding food, apart from Jieyang County, other counties are insufficient in supply, and a large amount of foreign rice is imported each year. However, the establishment of the Jieyang sugar factory is uneconomical due to the local conditions. Because the local people have the habit of making refined sugar, they are unwilling to sell sugarcane to the sugar factory. Even if they are willing to sell, they often demand high prices. If the sugar factory wants to grow sugarcane itself, the price of land in Chaozhou is very high, so the cost is also very high. For this reason, the cost of producing sugar at the sugar factory is too high, and the profit is too small. From an economic point of view, the Jieyang sugar factory should be moved to the southern region or Qiongya, because the land prices in the southern region and Qiongya are cheaper, and sugarcane can be purchased at a lower price, so development is easier. Meizhou is also short of rice. In the past, the largest product was Xingning cotton cloth, which was sold in large quantities to various places each year. In addition, there is also the production of fruit. In recent years, due to weather conditions, the sales of cotton cloth have decreased slightly, so there has been a gradual increase in fruit cultivation. There are also a few minerals. As for the Huizhou region, the soil is not very fertile. Although there is a sugarcane factory now, the sugarcane grown is not very good. In addition to cane sugar, there are various minerals. A lot of tungsten comes from Zijin, and many people are engaged in its mining. In addition to the above, there is a lot of afforestation in the various regions. However, the methods used in the past were immature, and there was no overall plan. The current forests in the various regions are mostly pine and fir. Fir can be used for construction, while pine is only used for firewood or raw materials. The government is also paying close attention to this and has established forest farms in various counties, setting up nurseries and gradually increasing the planting of various trees. In a few years, the forestry in the eastern region will definitely develop. As for</p>
<p>Telephone Communications</p>
<p>All counties in the eastern region have long-distance telephone services, but there is no overall plan. At present, most of the telephones are operated by private companies in each county, which makes the connection between the various locations difficult, and the management methods are also inconsistent. In order to improve the transportation industry, special attention should be paid to this. Finally, Director Liu also said that after he prepares to go to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session, he will accompany Mr. Billet, the commercial counselor of the British Embassy, and others to inspect the industries in the southern region and Qiongya in order to develop them.</p>
<h3>"Japanese Schistosomiasis" Discovered in Fuqing and Putian, Fujian</h3>
<p>Parasitic Snails or Swimming in the Water; Drinking this Water or Bathing will Result in Worm Enlargement Disease</p>
<p>Xiamen Communication, "Japanese schistosomiasis" has recently been discovered in Fuqing and Putian counties. Yu Wenguang, director of the Fuqing St. Luke's Hospital, accompanied Dr. Han of the Fourth Treatment Patrol Team, Yang Sheng, director of the Putian Drug Rehabilitation Center, and Ruan Fuchou, director of the St. Luke's Hospital Laboratory, to Houlong Village, eight miles outside the west gate of Fuqing, on January 25th to investigate the source of the disease. It was learned that "Japanese Schistosomiasis" is a type of microbe that lives in water and often parasitizes snails or swims in the water. If people accidentally drink water containing these microbes or bathe in this water, they will get worm enlargement disease. Last year, a patient from Houlong Village with worm disease went to Ma Keai Hospital in Fuzhou for treatment. After the surgery, the doctor felt that the disease was different from common worms, so he sent the waste taken from the patient's abdomen to the Peking Union Medical College for analysis, which revealed that it was "Japanese Schistosomiasis." Therefore, Director Yu and others made a special trip to Houlong Township to conduct a field investigation and found that there were many patients with worm disease in the township. They took the feces and urine of the patients and the snails from the creek back for examination and research, and investigated whether the disease was distributed in more than 30 villages nearby. It was learned that some people in Shuitou Village in the fourth district of Putian also had this disease, so Director Yu and others went to the village to investigate. (January 31st)</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Faces Shortage of Grain and Copper Coins</h3>
<p>Rice and Copper Coins Rise in Price Simultaneously; Representatives of Two Groups Discuss Relief</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication, The prices of grain and copper coins in this city have recently soared simultaneously. White rice is now sold for eleven yuan per stone, and each copper coin (old cast) costs five wen (originally three wen), which has greatly affected people's livelihoods. On January 29th, the provincial government ordered the Provincial Public Security Bureau, the Minhou County Government, and the Minhou Chamber of Commerce to plan relief measures. The Minhou County Chamber of Commerce convened meetings of the rice merchants and money changers on the afternoon of the 30th. The details of the proceedings are as follows:</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Meeting</p>
<p>More than 20 representatives of the rice merchants attended the meeting, which was chaired by Commerce Committee member Wan Yinru. He reported on the relief issue of rising rice prices, stating that he had consulted the Department of Civil Affairs and received three instructions: ㊀ Investigate the amount of rice currently stored in the provincial capital, ㊁ Determine the daily rice demand of the entire city, ㊂ Identify where rice is currently stored that can be purchased. However, the rice produced in the provincial capital cannot meet the demand. In the past, there was a large supply of rice from the Xi River, as well as rice from Jiangxi and Zhejiang, which was transported to northern Fujian and then to the province. Since the price of Fujian salt exceeded that of Huai salt, the neighboring counties of Jiangxi and Zhejiang no longer purchased Fujian salt, so the rice produced in those two provinces was also diverted to other places. In the past, northern Fujian was plagued by bandits and the countryside was abandoned, but they still came to the province to purchase rice. Fortunately, the local area has been peaceful in recent years, and the rice production has a surplus to transport to the province. The late rice harvest was abundant last year, and the price of rice should not be so high. How should we provide relief now to maintain the supply of grain? We ask everyone to share their views, and the association will forward them to the government for adoption. The rice merchants expressed their opinions one after another. As a result, they requested the Chamber of Commerce to forward a request to the provincial government to allow free flow of rice from the interior, without the need to apply for rice transportation permits, in order to save procedures and speed up the process. It is necessary to prevent private exports at the seaports, so that prices can be reduced. It is heard that the association will immediately forward the request to the provincial Department of Civil Affairs for instructions. As for the rice stored in the provincial capital, there are currently 30,000 stones, and the daily demand is 2,000 stones, which is only enough for half a month.</p>
<p>Money Changers Meeting</p>
<p>More than 10 representatives of the money changers attended the meeting, which was chaired by Commerce Committee member Song Jingyan. First, the representatives of the money changers reported that there was a shortage of copper coins on the market. The money changing shops collected the coins from the shops to meet the market demand. However, the copper coins in the shops are all collected from their own income, so when people go to the money changing shops to exchange money, there are no copper coins to exchange. The reasons for the shortage may be hoarding or private exports. In order to maintain the circulation of the market, all member shops should try their best to collect coins from various shops, and the exchange rate should be unified at four and a half wen per coin, and 22 coins for 100 wen of subsidiary currency, without arbitrary fluctuations. It is also necessary to investigate those who hoard copper coins and request the government to investigate them. (January 31st)</p>
<h3>Song Rujiu and Others from Zhongyuan Trading Company Collude with Foreigners to Evade Customs Duties</h3>
<p>Song and Seven Others Were Arrested by the Police; Sentenced to Imprisonment by the Court</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication, Since the large-scale smuggling by Ronin, unscrupulous merchants in this city have also often colluded with foreigners to evade customs duties. Last year, the Jiao Sea Customs suffered from the impact of smuggling, and its annual revenue sharply declined. Therefore, in recent times, the customs has been very serious in investigating and seizing smuggled goods. In October of last year, two smuggling cases were cracked, and they were sent to the court prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution. Now that the court has completed the trial, sentences of life imprisonment and fixed-term imprisonment have been handed down separately. The facts of the crimes and the main text of the judgment are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Facts of the Crime</p>
<p>Song Rujiu, manager of the Zhongyuan Trading Company on Jimolu Road in this city, co-founded the Zhongyuan Trading Company in January of last year with Ren Ruishan and Niu Fengchi in Osaka, Japan. Song and Ren were managers, and Niu was responsible for purchasing goods in Osaka. Ren worked as a helper in the postal parcel room, transporting the parcels on behalf of the company and requesting exemption from inspection. The shop assistants, Niu Haoru and Huang Kejian, helped with the operations, specializing in trafficking private goods for profit. Song Rujiu and Niu Fengchi also colluded with Ronin separately to reduce customs duties and entrusted the Ronin to carry goods and evade customs duties. Ren Ruishan used his status as a postal worker to transport parcels on behalf of the Zhongyuan Trading Company and requested exemption from inspection to facilitate evasion, which was not a one-time occurrence. On October 21st of last year, Song Rujiu knew that the 52 pieces of rayon carried by Dong Fuxiang were goods on which taxes had been evaded, but he still purchased them. The police arrested Song Rujiu, Ren Ruishan, Niu Haoru, Huang Kejian, and others one after another. Dong Fuxiang, Zhang Shouli, Yu Shousan, and Xu Zhankui, as well as Wang Yongkuan and Zhang Zhenhai in Dalian, all knew each other. Dong Fuxiang saw the profit in evading customs duties, so he had Xu Zhankui, Zhang Shouli, Yu Shousan, and others each contribute capital to purchase rayon, rock sugar, white sugar, and other items from Dalian, mix them in their luggage, and come to Qingdao by boat to evade customs duties. This happened a total of three times. On October 29th of last year, the Public Security Bureau arrested Dong Fuxiang, Xu Zhankui, Zhang Shouli, and Yu Shousan one after another. Ni Fengliang knew that Dong Fuxiang's rayon was goods on which taxes had been evaded, but he still carried them to Shanghai for sale. He was also investigated and arrested by the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the local court in this city. The prosecutor investigated and filed a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Main Text of the Judgment</p>
<p>Dong Fuxiang is sentenced to ten years of fixed-term imprisonment for continuously colluding to evade customs duties. Xu Zhankui, Zhang Shouli, and Yu Shousan are each sentenced to five years of fixed-term imprisonment for continuously colluding to evade customs duties. Ni Fengliang is sentenced to three years of fixed-term imprisonment for selling goods that he knew were used to evade customs duties. Song Rujiu is sentenced to life imprisonment, with permanent deprivation of political rights, for colluding with foreigners to evade customs duties. He is sentenced to six months of fixed-term imprisonment for knowingly buying and selling goods on which taxes had been evaded. Life imprisonment is enforced, with permanent deprivation of political rights. Ren Ruishan is sentenced to fifteen years of fixed-term imprisonment, reduced from life imprisonment, for colluding with foreigners to evade customs duties. Niu Haoru is sentenced to twelve years of fixed-term imprisonment for assisting in colluding with foreigners to evade customs duties. Dong Kejian is sentenced to twelve years of fixed-term imprisonment for assisting in colluding with foreigners to evade customs duties. Other parts of the prosecution are acquitted.</p>
<h3>Overview of Land Administration in Beijing (Continued)</h3>
<p>Two Important Tasks Completed Last Year; Implementation Plan for This Year Also Confirmed</p>
<p>The above describes the process of approving land value tax rates. Regarding the estimation of land values, when the Land Bureau of the city was reorganized into the Land Administration Bureau in June, one first-class land estimation specialist and two second-class land estimation specialists were appointed to specifically handle land value estimation. Their estimation methods all followed the procedures stipulated in the Land Law. On one hand, they investigated the market prices of land transactions in recent years. On the other hand, they sent letters to various district offices to inquire about recent market values. They also referenced the values reported by property owners when registering their property rights, calculating the overall average. However, for land with no recent transactions or no market value to investigate, they adopted a comparative estimation method and a revenue capitalization method. Areas with similar land values were designated as land value zones, and standard land values were estimated for each location to determine its value. Then, for land within each local value zone that had special advantages in location or inferior terrain, the standard price could be slightly increased or decreased, but not exceeding one-third of the standard price. After the standard land values were drafted, they were submitted to the Municipal Land Valuation Committee for review. The committee was composed of the heads of various municipal bureaus, representatives from the court, the chamber of commerce, the bankers' association, and several expert members. When discussing land values in each district, the district head of each district was also invited to attend. The estimated land values were finalized only after being reviewed and approved by the committee, and land value charts and tables for each district were created and submitted to higher-level agencies for record-keeping. At the same time, the public was notified for a period of one month. If there were special circumstances requiring an increase or decrease in land value, property owners were notified separately. If there were any objections, they had twenty days to raise them. If no objections were raised within the deadline, or if objections were resolved through reassessment or arbitration, the estimated values became final. Investigations reveal that land values in all districts of Beijing were estimated and completed within the twenty-fifth year [of the Republic], and the district land value distributions and the highest and lowest prices have been announced successively. Tables are attached below.</p>
<p>After the land values of each district were estimated, land value registers and land tax registers were compiled according to the estimated land values and approved tax rates. The land tax registers were completed and sent to the Finance Bureau, scheduled to be levied in December of the 25th year [of the Republic]. The land value registers have also been compiled and will be printed and submitted to the Municipal Government for forwarding to the Ministry of Interior for record-keeping.</p>
<p>The Beijing Municipal Government originally planned to levy land value tax and land appreciation tax simultaneously, but due to insufficient time for completing the procedures, the appreciation tax could not be levied as scheduled. It is currently being expedited. Beijing has been levying deed tax on real estate transfers. Because the appreciation tax has not yet been levied, the deed tax continues to be levied. Furthermore, the city was unable to estimate the value of land improvements in a timely manner due to the complicated estimation procedures. The Municipal Government submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval to temporarily suspend the levy, instead levying 70% of the original house tax to replace the land improvement tax, and set a deadline of three years to complete the land improvement value estimation in order to levy the land improvement tax.</p>
<p>Land Expropriation</p>
<p>As the capital of the country, Beijing has many land expropriation cases for public utilities. Investigations show that in the 25th year [of the Republic], the Municipal Land Administration Bureau handled land expropriation cases totaling approximately 360 mu for municipal construction projects related to road construction, over 100 mu for educational purposes related to the expansion of municipal primary and secondary schools, and approximately 840 mu for other projects such as the establishment of public housing areas, public cemeteries, slaughterhouses, vegetable markets, and toilets. In addition, the land entrusted to the city by various agencies and schools for expropriation reached over 11,000 mu. In total, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau paid a total of 663,000 yuan in compensation for land expropriation in the 25th year [of the Republic]. The expropriation procedures were all handled in accordance with the provisions of the Land Law.</p>
<p>In addition, the handling of public land in Beijing is carried out in accordance with the "Regulations for the Handling of Public Land" and the "Regulations for the Clearing of Urban Public Land" promulgated by the Executive Yuan.

<p>Organizing River Dredging and Tree Planting</p>
<p>The county's Bureau of Construction is organizing the dredging of rivers by conscripted labor because the rivers in the four townships are crisscrossed, and the riverbeds are silted up, especially during this farming season, in order to carry out water conservancy work. There are nine major rivers in the Second District: Daqiao Shenggang, Jiuli Jing, Luwang Jing, Cao Wang Jing; the Fourth District: Dahongqiao River, Luquqiao Xi River; the Sixth District: Yang River, Kuatang River, Zhang Miaoshe River, etc. The total length is over 26 kilometers, and the estimated amount of earth to be excavated is over 242,248 cubic meters.

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Difficulties in Investigating Opium Smokers</p>
<p>According to the authorities, the total number of opium smokers arrested in the recent general review of opium smokers here reached 1,230. Some of those mistakenly arrested are also undergoing investigation in the hospital. Currently, the county hospital is facing various difficulties due to the sudden increase in the number of opium smokers. The hospital can only accommodate 120 people, but the number has now increased to over 400, causing the outpatient clinics, surgery and internal medicine consultation rooms, etc., to be converted into opium smoker investigation rooms. The hospital receives 60 yuan per month from the county for food expenses, but with such a large increase in numbers, there will be a shortage of food. Moreover, opium smokers are not allowed to bring bedding when admitted. The wards are temporary conversions, making it difficult to endure the severe cold. The reagent bottles used for testing opium smokers have also run out. Furthermore, the two testers can only test a maximum of 20 people per day, meaning that it will take 20 days to test these 400 opium smokers, which is not in accordance with the regulations. The hospital is feeling overwhelmed by all of this and has submitted a request to the county for instructions.</p>

<h3>Amendments to the 1936-37 Men's Basketball Rules (Continued)</h3>
<p>Translation Published by the National Amateur Athletic Federation of China</p>
<p>Article 13: The timekeeper shall record when each half begins. Three minutes before the start time, they should report to the referee so that the referee can notify the teams or inform the teams at least three minutes before the start time. The timekeeper should inform the scorer two minutes before the start time. The timekeeper shall record the time of play as stipulated by the rules and the time-outs within the game.</p>
<p>The timekeeper shall have at least one stopwatch designated as the game clock, which shall be managed by one of the timekeepers. It shall be placed appropriately so that both people can view it together. At the start of each half or overtime period, or when play resumes after a time-out with a jump ball, the game clock shall be started when the referee blows the whistle and the ball leaves his hand. If play is resumed with a throw-in from out of bounds or a free throw, the game clock shall be started when the ball is thrown in and crosses the boundary line or when the free throw is missed.</p>
<p>The game clock shall be stopped at the end of each half or quarter, when an official declares a foul, or when a time-out is granted or a substitute player is allowed to enter the court. When the game clock is stopped, the timekeeper should immediately start another clock to calculate the time-out period. When the time-out period or the unauthorized time-out period expires, the timekeeper should notify the scorer with a signal to the official. At the end of the actual game time of each half or quarter or overtime period, the timekeeper should fire a gun, strike a gong, or blow a whistle to report the end of the game time. This signal shall be the standard. If the signal is damaged, but can be issued on time, or is issued but not heard, the timekeeper should immediately run onto the court or notify the referee by other means. If, in the meantime, the ball has been shot or a foul has occurred, the referee should consult with the timekeeper to determine whether it is valid. If both timekeepers agree that the time had already expired before the ball was released for the shot or the foul occurred, the referee should rule that the shot is invalid or that the foul, if not overly egregious, should be cancelled. However, if the two timekeepers disagree and the referee is unable to determine, the referee should rule that the shot or the foul is valid.</p>
<p>(Note) The electric timing method has been approved for adoption and should be tested for suitability in accordance with the above timing methods. If two clocks are available, one of the timekeepers shall manage the game clock and the signal, and the other shall act as the checker and manage the time-out clock.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, Article 2: The first sentence should be amended as follows:</p>
<p>Three minutes before the start of each half, the captains of both teams should be notified.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, Article 6: The last sentence should be changed to prevent obstruction by other players during jump balls in China, as follows: During jump balls in China or on any free throw line, other players, except for the two jump ball players, should stand outside the circle (6.5-foot radius circle) until the ball has been touched. Violation is a violation (penalty is a throw-in from out of bounds by the opposing team), but repeated violations may be considered delaying the game.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, Article 7: A new sentence is added to indicate the position that other players should stand when a jump ball occurs outside of China or a free throw. The sentence is as follows:</p>
<p>Other players should stand at a considerable distance from the jump ballers and the officials before the jump ballers touch the ball.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, Article 9: Two new sentences are added. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>When the game time expires, the timekeeper shall issue a signal, and the entire game shall be over (see Chapter 7, Article 7). If a player commits a foul when the timekeeper issues a signal to report the end of a half or overtime period or before the signal is issued, the overtime period should be extended and a free throw should be held immediately until it is completed. If the foul is discovered at the end of the first or third quarter of the game, or during the rest period after the first or third quarter, the free throw should be held at the start of the next quarter. If the foul is a personal foul, the game shall begin when the free throw is missed, or when the free throw is made, it shall begin with a throw-in from out of bounds by the opposing team. Each half time or each overtime time, the game begins with a center circle jump ball.</p>
<p>Chapter 13, Article 1: The note has been modified. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>(Note) If there are multiple free throws or a re-throw (replacing the original free throw), then the above item ㊁ only applies to the last free throw.</p>
<p>To ensure the accuracy of the calculated time, officials and timekeepers should agree on a certain code to indicate the start and end times. This is especially important during fouls and free throws.</p>
<p>Chapter 11, Article 3: The number of timeouts that each team should be allowed to request is increased to four (the old rule was three).</p>
<p>Chapter 14, Article 1: The penalty is changed. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Penalty: Invalid free throw. Regardless of whether the free throw is made or missed, the ball is awarded to a player on the opposing team for a throw-in from out of bounds at the end line. If there is more than one free throw, this provision of the throw-in from out of bounds only applies to the last free throw. If the free throw is for a technical foul, the game should continue with a jump ball in the center circle.</p>
<p>Chapter 15, Article 1: ㊂ "After three timeouts" is changed to after four timeouts.</p>
<p>Chapter 15, Article 1 Note: "When the ball has not been patted before jumping the ball" is changed to when jumping the ball, before the ball is thrown up</p>
<p>Chapter 15, Article 2 and Note: This is an important change by the committee. Before or after reporting to the officials, substitute players may speak with other players, but must report and prepare for the game immediately. After a substitute player reports to the scorer and obtains permission from the official to enter the court, he may send messages to teammates or give instructions on basketball tactics. If, during a timeout for other reasons, a substitute player may communicate with his teammates after reporting to the official. Because of the above changes, the phrase "or directly talking to other players without being told by the referee before the game starts" is deleted from this article, and a note is added as follows:</p>
<p>(Note) The sentence prohibiting substitute players from talking has been deleted. When entering the court, substitute players must report to the officials immediately, regardless of whether it is during a timeout for other reasons, so that the game can continue on time within 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Chapter 15, Article 9: A new note is added. The purpose of this note is not to defend rough actions, but to maintain fairness for defenders in normal ball-stealing situations if there is slight and unintentional contact. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>When blocking a shot or pass, or stealing the ball from an opponent's hand, if a player touches the ball and the part of his hand below the wrist touches the opponent's hand without contact with other parts of the body, it is an accidental normal pat and is not considered a foul.</p>
<p>Correction: Yesterday's "Chapter 6, Article 4" was a mistake for "Chapter 6, Article 14". (End)</p>

<h3>Several Secondary Education Issues Concerning English Teaching (5)</h3>
<p>— Wang Shijie</p>
<p>Only then can these endeavors be substantial and stable, and only then can the country progress. In the future, secondary education should regard further education and employment as two equally important goals. To be more specific, in addition to focusing on cultivating leading talents, more attention should be paid to cultivating middle and lower-level cadres for national and social endeavors.</p>
<p>Fifth, the current curriculum of secondary schools and the scope of English teaching secondary education is very broad, and there are many problems. What has been said above only addresses a few basic issues that are closely related to the main topic of today's conference, explaining the urgent matters that should be paid attention to at present. Moreover, what has been said above does not propose any abstract or lofty ideals, but only discusses the gradual changes that should be made in the future based on current facts. I will now briefly summarize it, which is: ㊀ Secondary education should cultivate practical and useful knowledge; ㊁ The knowledge cultivated by secondary education should emphasize both theory and practice; ㊂ Secondary education should cultivate students' initiative; ㊃ Secondary education should give equal attention to students' further education and employment. Specifically speaking, in addition to cultivating leading talents, it should also cultivate a large number of healthy middle and lower-level cadre talents. If we feel that these few principles are close to the facts and meet the needs, we may as well discuss these few points more fully, arouse deeper and more focused attention from all sectors of society, and enable these few principles to gain universal support and unanimous advocacy from the national education community and other sectors, so that the development of the entire secondary education in the future can be governed by these few principles and achieve balanced and harmonious development. In the past few years, the Ministry of Education has made some preliminary reform efforts based on the principles we can think of in the regulation of secondary schools, normal schools, and vocational schools across the country, the revision of curricula in various types of schools, and the enrichment of equipment. We can only admit that this is just a preliminary work of breaking ground, but the matter is too big and too complicated, and there are too many aspects that should be paid attention to. Although there is some experience, we ultimately feel that we have very little grasp. If the principles proposed above can be established, the reforms in the future must naturally be gradual, and we should gradually seek their realization step by step according to what experience allows. To realize these principles, a very important task is of course the curriculum in secondary schools. The current curriculum of secondary schools has been revised several times and is the result of the thoughts and experiences of many people. Moreover, we are still constantly striving to make it more complete and more in line with the needs based on new experiences and new facts. The revision of the secondary school curriculum recently was only a few months ago, and the regulations on physical education in secondary schools were also just announced a few days ago. In the future, when the secondary school curriculum needs to be revised again, it should also be governed by the above principles, and the teaching materials and teaching methods related to the curriculum should also be gradually improved to conform to the above-mentioned principles. Such a principled, planned, and systematic reform requires considerable time, money, and experience, but we believe that after such a reform, the secondary education in China will be refreshed.</p>
<p>Today is the first day of the conference of the Chinese Western Language Society in Beiping. The main topic discussed is most closely related to the English teaching of secondary schools, especially middle schools. English is one of the main courses in junior and senior high schools. In junior high schools, just in terms of class time, English accounts for an average of more than one-eighth of each student's total weekly hours. In senior high schools, English accounts for an average of one-sixth, and for some students, it can account for more than one-quarter in the third year of high school, which is a total of eight hours per week. The secondary school curriculum recognizes the importance it deserves. Such time allocation can be considered quite sufficient. If the time spent by each middle school student in English classes over six years is roughly calculated, it is about 430 hours in junior high school and about 540 to 650 hours in senior high school, totaling about 970 to 1080 hours. This refers to class hours. Assuming that each hour of homework requires two hours of preparation, the total preparation time for six years is about 1940 to 2160 hours. Adding up the class and preparation hours, a senior high school student spends a total of about 2910 to 2140 hours studying English over six years. This is an astonishing number. If a middle school student spends such a long time on a relatively common subject, and if he is a diligent student, and the teaching materials, teachers, and teaching methods are all appropriate, even if his achievements cannot be extremely excellent, at least he should gain a considerable and rich harvest of preliminary basic knowledge, and a relatively solid grasp. He should gain a fairly thorough understanding and a considerable degree of confidence in English writing, reading, and speaking. However, in fact, the English performance of current high school graduates is generally poor. The English test scores of freshmen admitted to universities each year are generally disappointing. Not only are they mostly unclear about the structure of common English grammar and unable to form sentences and chapters, but also the spelling and writing of some common English words are mostly full of errors. The ability to understand English is even more extremely weak. The impression gained by the examiners is often very bad. Judging from the statistics of foreign language scores in the university freshman entrance examination in the twenty-fourth year, 60% of the freshmen in national and public colleges and universities scored below 60 points, and the scores in the entrance examination are generally not too strict. Those who have handled university admission examinations know this. Of course, the teaching of English outside its native country has its special difficulties, which no one can deny, but its difficulties, saying that it is special is possible, saying that it is particularly large is not necessarily true. It is not necessarily more difficult than subjects such as physics, chemistry, and mathematics. The current situation creates a very difficult problem for university education. Since the English level of high school graduates is so poor, if they do not make special efforts to make up for it in the first two years after entering university, they will feel that it is extremely difficult or impossible to read original reference books. If they are still willing to work hard to make up for it, it is equivalent to moving the homework that should be done in secondary school to university, so that other subjects in university cannot but be affected. And now the coursework in university, especially in science and engineering, is quite heavy, so this problem of English teaching is directly related to secondary education and indirectly affects higher education. The most important thing is that students cannot refer to original books, blocking an important way of self-study and cutting off the hope of studying advanced knowledge. If he does not go to university, then enters society, not only can he not use what he has learned in English before, but he will not have progress, and even what he has learned before will be forgotten together. The 3,000 hours of work spent in the previous six years is tantamount to being wasted. This is a great loss, so this problem is quite serious at present. To seek remedy,</p>

<h3>Yarn and Fabric</h3>
<p>Long Positions Maintained, Recent Yarn Price Rises Revived</p>
<p>After the previous day's sharp decline in the yarn market, the market stabilized yesterday. This was mainly because major players did not relax their long positions. Indian merchants also did not give up on the February contract. Changfeng, Gengfeng, Jinchang, and others continued to add to their positions in large amounts. As a result, the market tightened suddenly and held up in the near term. Due to the sluggishness of the overseas yarn market and the lack of real demand, industry players tended to sell, resulting in a particularly strong pressure.</p>
<p>Large Players Drag in Marked Yarn</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened lower across the board. The decline in the current month was particularly severe due to the loose and self-abusive attitude of a certain cotton company's wholesale release of files on the previous day. Today, they continued to advance with a false wind. Short sellers took the opportunity to exert high pressure. Unexpectedly, Changfeng worked hard to drag in on behalf of a certain merchant, and Jinchang also bought, for a particularly large amount. All floating chips were thrown in by them, and the market gradually rebounded after a round. As a result, each month fell by 1.3 to 1.5 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market situation was tighter after the afternoon opening, and each month saw an increase again, with major players still buying. However, spot yarn transactions were sluggish, and the price of third-grade yarn fell. Market sentiment was not restrained. The current month was very expensive. As a result, February rose by 1.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price, a rapid increase of 2.3 to 4 jiao. It was found that Chen Ji sold 1,200 bales, Hengyi 1,050 bales, Yuren 2,500 bales, Dafeng 3,350 bales, Ruidai 1,200 bales, Dachangcheng 1,800 bales, Mei Ji 1,500 bales, Yi Ji 650 bales, Hexing 600 bales. Dafu bought 1,100 bales, Jinchang 2,250 bales, Gengfeng 4,650 bales, Wang Taixing 1,950 bales, Changcheng 1,050 bales, Changfeng 1,000 bales, Run Kang 1,100 bales, and Fukang 650 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below (see layout).</p>
<p>Thread Price Rises Alone by One Yuan</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still considered to be considerable, among which thread transactions are very strong. It was found that all gangs bought a total of 1,065 bales throughout the day, with prices being average and thread rising by one yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below (see layout).</p>
<p>Retail Investors Make Up, Cotton Price Once Rebounds</p>
<p>The cotton market is stable and the trend is unusually peaceful. The general trend is still in a state of wandering and hesitation. Hankou gang has a slight makeup, and Dafu Changhe purchased a lot, but the spot cotton business is deserted, and factory demand is stagnant.</p>
<p>Bearish View Not Lacking in Marked Cotton</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened lower due to the continued decline in U.S. cotton, a slight increase in Indian cotton, and the sluggishness of the yarn market. The decline has been very severe recently. After a round, retail investors came to make up again. At the same time, the yarn market improved, and market prices gradually rebounded, but the trading volume in the market was very thin. As a result, each month rose by 1 to 1.5 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market situation was stable after the afternoon opening, with very little fluctuation up and down each month. Because the impact of the U.S. cotton flood on cotton fields is not expanding, there are many who are bearish. As a result, each month fell by 5 to 1 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Gengfeng sold 1,800 dan, Ruidai 5,000 dan, Yongyu 2,100 dan, Dachangcheng 1,700 dan, Yichang 1,300 dan, Changfeng 3,000 dan, Xiecheng 1,000 dan, Yongda 1,400 dan, Juxing 1,200 dan, Dafeng 1,200 dan. Dafu bought 8,400 dan, Dafeng 1,300 dan, Changhe 5,900 dan, Run Kang 1,500 dan, and Fukang 900 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Arrival and Sales Both Quiet</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is depressed, factory demand is deserted, and the source is 200 bales of Yao cotton, with no general cotton available.</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Raw Cotton Purchases by Yarn Factories in January</p>
<p>According to a survey by a certain cotton industry organization, the total amount of cotton purchased by Shanghai Sino-Japanese factories in January this year was 77,140 bales, a sharp decrease of 43,828 bales compared with the average in December last year. Among them, Sino-Japanese yarn factories purchased 30,323 bales, a decrease of 28,873 bales from the previous month. The amount purchased by Chinese factories was 46,917 bales, also a decrease of 16,955 bales. The reason for the decrease is said to be that the yarn factory workers have several days of rest during the old calendar year, and the factory's demand has decreased. The amount and flower names of purchases by Sino-Japanese factories are listed below (unit: bales).</p>
<p>U.S. Cotton Suffers Another Setback After Rising</p>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with a firm market. Each month fell by a pound to rise by four pounds. In the early morning, the Liverpool telegram was good, and the flood situation was uncertain. Industry players bought near-month contracts, and brokers and foreign merchants bought far-month contracts. The market was firm. Unfortunately, when the May contract rose to 1.27 cents, it encountered great resistance. Afterwards, long positions were closed, and the purchase of foreign cotton to hedge the U.S. cotton market price turned weak. Industry players are waiting for the sale of pledged cotton, fearing that low-grade cotton will be hedged in the market, and the market may be oppressed by it. The closing was average, with spot falling by four pounds, and first-tier goods falling by two to six pounds. British cotton spot rose by two points, and futures fell by one to two points. Indian cotton was firm due to overseas news favorable to buyers, and industry players and speculators purchased it. Later, the news from Liverpool was good, and the market was even firmer, with Pingguoer rising by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, Aomula rising by 1 to 1.25 rupees, and Bairoxi remaining unchanged. The original telegram is recorded on the left (one day electricity).</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>User Silk Transactions Quite Brisk</p>
<p>——Prepare for a Bull Market and Sell Wisely——</p>
<p>Recently, overseas silk markets have gradually stabilized after repeated declines due to the floods in the United States and the unrest in Japanese politics. Yesterday, the prices of American silk futures were firm. It is expected that the silk market will rebound. The opening price of New York standard silk for near-term futures was 205 yuan, up 3 cents from last Saturday, and futures rose by 4 and a half cents. The prices of Yokohama spot two-cargoes rose slightly by two or three yuan. The Lyon silk market was quiet and the price was sluggish. Currently, in the Shanghai silk market, because there are very few silk factories starting work, the stock is also depleted, and there is even a shortage of spot goods on the market, so the silk price can still maintain a relatively stable price. Yesterday, the American firm's account of White Factory B-word RR limited price was 810 yuan, which is about 20 yuan away from the Shanghai market, so it is still rarely sold open. In the Indian silk market, the sales of yellow and white native silk are still healthy, such as Wuyang KKK which sold for 480 yuan, which is 20 yuan higher than last weekend. Other silk products have also risen accordingly. In the user silk market, because general silk mills are aware that at the beginning of the waste calendar year, the silk price may continue to be firm, so they generally buy more goods to spend the year, so the transaction is quite strong, such as the white factory replanting which sold for 820 yuan, which is 10 yuan higher than last week, and the market atmosphere is trending stronger. Yesterday, a total of 105 bales were traded.</p>
<p>Green Tea Exports Outstrip Demand</p>
<p>Recently, the sales of green tea have suddenly become active. Various European firms are vigorously soliciting eyebrow, pearl, needle-eyebrow and other green teas because of the urgent demand from Morocco. However, the incoming goods from the tea estates have already been sold out, and the supply is already unable to meet the demand. General local tea factory manufacturers who have found raw materials for coarse tea have also started purchasing again. The selling price of secondary coarse tea has surged from 11 or 12 yuan per dan to 17 or 18 yuan, and there is not much stock left. It is heard that tea estates such as China Tea Tongyifeng have already started production to meet the needs of foreign firms. It is said that this situation is unprecedented in recent years.</p>

<h3>German Cruiser Emden Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Captain Lohmann Immediately Went Ashore to Visit the Authorities; Hosted Chinese and Foreign Journalists to Visit at 3 PM</p>
<p>The German cruiser Emden visited Beijing some time ago and has now completed its mission. It sailed into the Wusongkou at 7 AM yesterday morning and docked at Pier No. 3 in front of the Gonghexiang Wharf at 9 AM. German expatriates in Shanghai held flags and stood to welcome it. Captain Lohmann immediately went ashore to visit the local authorities. At 3 PM, he hosted journalists from Shanghai to visit the ship. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Visit to the Mayor</p>
<p>After the ship docked, "Captain Lohmann, accompanied by several senior officers, went to the German Consulate to visit Consul-General Kriebel. Kriebel then accompanied him to the Municipal Government in the city center at 10 AM to visit Mayor Wu Tiecheng. The Mayor, accompanied by Secretary Tang Shixuan, received them and expressed a warm welcome to the ship's arrival in Shanghai. He offered them champagne and they talked for more than ten minutes. Tang then accompanied them to visit the new buildings such as the library, museum, and stadium in the city center before they left.</p>
<p>Visit to the Naval Vice Minister</p>
<p>At 11 AM, they went to the Public Concession's Municipal Council to visit Chairman Arnold. At 12 PM, they went to Gaochangmiao to visit Chen Jiliang, the Naval Vice Minister and Commander of the First Fleet. Chen, accompanied by senior officers, received them. At around 12 PM, they went to Longhua to visit Yang Hu, the Garrison Commander. After leaving, they returned to the ship. At 3 PM in the afternoon, Arnold went to return the visit. At 3:30 PM, Garrison Commander Yang Hu, accompanied by Sun Liping and Zhao Weixian, went to return the visit and tour the ship. At 4 PM, Naval Vice Minister Chen Jiliang went to the ship to return the visit. Mayor Wu is scheduled to return the visit at 10 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Hosting Journalists</p>
<p>At 3 PM yesterday afternoon, the ship hosted Chinese and foreign journalists from Shanghai. They traveled by the warship's small launch from the Xinguans Wharf. About 70 or 80 reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers arrived. After boarding the ship, they first went to the dining room to rest and were offered cigarettes and alcohol. Captain Lohmann was hosting Yang Hu and others to return the visit, so Lieutenant Commander Leiber, the ship's intelligence officer, delivered a welcome speech, saying, "I represent the captain in welcoming you to visit. Now, because the captain is hosting Commander Yang, he cannot spare the time, so I apologize. We have prepared some refreshments, please rest for a while and visit the various departments in groups."</p>
<p>Captain's Report</p>
<p>Later, Captain Lohmann also came to give a speech, saying, "I have met with the authorities of your country several times in Beijing and have been invited to visit various new constructions, which is very gratifying. I hope that you will give me more advice when I come to Shanghai this time." Then, the ship's personnel led the reporters to visit the various departments. Although the scale was small, the equipment was very complete. Inside the ship, there was a bronze plate with the ship's name left over from the first Emden, and an image of Captain von Müller, as well as a shark hanging in the radio room at the highest point, which was caught in Singapore. After the tour, they were returned to the Xinguans Wharf by the original launch at around 4 PM.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Equipment</p>
<p>Before the European War, the ship was a cruiser squadron commanded by General Spee, stationed in Qingdao, China. When the war broke out, it left China via the Pacific Ocean and returned to its country. In the southern part of the Pacific Ocean, it was blocked by the British Navy, and then appeared in the Indian Ocean, sinking more than 20 warships and merchant ships of the Allied countries, and its reputation shook the world. On September 9, 1914, it encountered the Australian warship Sydney at Cocos Island and was sunk in a battle. In order to retain the ship's prestigious name, a new ship was built in 1916, still named Emden. In 1917, it was stationed on Böld Island in Russia, and was defeated and sunk again in 1918. The current ship is the third one, launched on January 7, 1925 and incorporated into the fleet on October 15 of the same year. According to the Treaty of Versailles, the ship weighs 6,000 tons, is 450 feet long, 45 feet wide, has a draft of 17 feet, a speed of 29 nautical miles per hour, and a motor that can generate 46,000 horsepower. There are 28 officers on the ship, one captain, seven mid-level crew members, 45 officers, 119 junior officers, and 468 soldiers (including 160 naval trainees), for a total of 668 people. The ship has eight 6-inch caliber guns, two 3.5-inch anti-aircraft guns, and two twin-barreled torpedo launchers. The ship is used for training. Recently, it made a special six-month tour, passing through Constantinople, the South Pacific Islands, etc., and arrived in Beijing. It will continue to go to South Pacific, Bombay, Alexandria, and southern England. It is expected to return to Wilhelmshaven in Germany in mid-April. The ship's soldiers are all young servicemen who are newly graduated naval students interning on the ship. After their term expires, they will be promoted to mid-level crew members. Captain Lohmann was the captain of the U45 submarine during the European War.</p>
<p>Itinerary in Shanghai</p>
<p>Last night, the German expatriates in Shanghai held a grand banquet and dance party at the Shanghai Race Club to welcome the ship's officers. The ship will stay in Shanghai for about a week, and its itinerary has been arranged by the German Consulate as follows: This afternoon, the members of the German Social Democratic Youth League will be hosted at the German Elementary School. The German Amateur Theatre Society will perform "Little Sparrow" at the Lyceum Theatre on both tonight and tomorrow night. On the 4th, some of the personnel will go to Suzhou for sightseeing and return to Shanghai that night. In the afternoon, the public of Shanghai will be invited to visit. At 8 PM in the evening, the German expatriates will hold a dance party at the Garden Bridge Club. On the 5th in the afternoon, some of the personnel will visit Tongji University. There will still be a dance party at the Garden Bridge Club that night. At 1 PM on the 6th in the afternoon, there will be a sports competition on Zhoujiazui Island.

<h3>The Municipal Federation and Other Organizations Sent a Letter to the Municipal Council Yesterday Requesting a Reconsideration of the Water Rate Increase</h3>
<p>Distributing Dividends Places the Burden on Users; Audit the Accounts and Order a Reduction in Profits</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation and other organizations in the First Special District sent a letter to the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council yesterday to protest against the increase in water rates, requesting them to submit a reconsideration and cancel the increase in order to ensure the livelihood of the people. The original letter stated: "Dear Sirs, the water rate set by the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company has been charged at 75% of the company's original price list since April 1935, and users have already felt it was an unbearable burden. Unexpectedly, the company's authorities insisted on maintaining a 9% official interest rate, and falsely claimed that the exchange rate had fallen and expenses had increased, so they secretly requested the approval of your Board of Directors to change to an 80% charge starting on February 1, effectively increasing the price. The residents of our district were deeply shocked upon hearing this. After holding a joint meeting of representatives of various organizations on January 30 to discuss it, they all said that since "January 28," Shanghai has suffered great trauma. Coupled with the years of floods and droughts, the rural economy has been destroyed, and the social economy has collapsed. Factories and shops have closed down one after another, and unemployment has increased sharply. However, the company's authorities disregarded the difficulties of the times, hoarding and monopolizing, arbitrarily expanding the issuance of bonus shares, and ordering users to increase their burden. This kind of policy will inevitably cause unrest among all the citizens. Our association decided that in addition to notifying users to deposit all water bills at the original price in the bank before the case is resolved, we would like to send a special letter to your Board of Directors requesting that the issue be reconsidered, the price increase be canceled, and the company's accounts be audited over the years, and that it be ordered to reduce profits as much as possible and save expenses in order to ensure the livelihood of the people. Otherwise, it will incite incidents, which will be of great concern to public tranquility and social order. We urge you to carefully reconsider and resolve the disputes. In addition, the Public Concession Waterworks Problem Research Committee organized by various groups is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 2:00 PM this afternoon to discuss research matters."</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Water Rises Sharply, Yangtze River Shipping is Smooth</h3>
<p>Large Ships Rush to Transport Passengers and Cargo; Loading for New Year Sales in Xun and Hankou</p>
<p>The Yangtze River water level has risen sharply recently, from 11 feet to 13 feet 7 inches, and is still increasing daily. The waterway from Jiujiang to Hankou has been completely unobstructed. Not only are large Yangtze River ships completely unobstructed, but seagoing ships transporting salt and coal, which have been blocked for more than a month, can now safely load and unload cargo. The Yangtze River is now fully navigable from upstream to downstream. Therefore, the Changxing Wheel, the deepest-draft ship of the Sanbei Company, which has been suspended for a long time, has now been fully loaded and has begun to resume service. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has also chartered the seagoing ship Tianxing to sail to Hankou to rush to transport passengers and cargo at the end of the waste calendar year. All large ships of Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, and Nissin Kisen Kaisha also generally go to Hankou. The goods that have been accumulated during the shallow water period have been rushed to be transported in recent days, so that they can be loaded to Xun and Hankou before the end of the waste calendar year for the New Year bull market sales.</p>
<h3>Shenbao Capital Extended by One Month</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance levies income tax. The first category of business income, all companies, shops, firms, factories, or individuals with a capital of more than 2,000 yuan, must pay income tax at the prescribed percentage of their net profit at the end of the year. However, the Ministry of Finance announced that the deadline for reporting capital within one month of the start of the process has expired. According to news from the Shanghai office, many people went to report during the period. However, there are also many smaller shops that did not report because of business practices and because they were in the midst of the general closing period and were unable to fill in the amount of capital. The office has been explaining to the industry associations through the Municipal Chamber of Commerce that the reporting of capital is a preliminary survey for reference only and has no other effect. All industries understand and promise to report immediately. Therefore, the office applied to the Ministry of Finance to extend the reporting period by one month to March 1, and has published a notice to all industries.</p>
<h3>The Copper Coin Problem: Bank of China Entrusted Tobacco Exchange Industry to Exchange</h3>
<p>9 jiao 9 fen per yuan; Still Feels Insufficient in the Market</p>
<p>The problem of rising copper coin prices has been going on for more than half a month. Now, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Bank of China, Central Bank, and Bank of Communications to level out the prices. Therefore, the Bank of China entrusted 100 exchange shops in the city to exchange starting yesterday, with a wholesale price of 9 jiao 9 fen per yuan. At this point, a serious copper coin problem has come to a temporary end. However, before dusk yesterday, tobacco exchange shops had not yet received subsidiary coins, so smaller shops agreed to go to the Central Bank to request an exchange. The exchange price in the market is still not uniform. Here is a summary of the details:</p>
<p>Central Bank Notice</p>
<p>Starting from today, the bank will entrust the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association to entrust 100 cooperative members to exchange 1 fen new copper coins. The bank's retail door-to-door exchange will be temporarily suspended. This is to notify you.</p>

<p>Starting from February 2, the association is entrusted by the Central Bank to entrust cooperative members to exchange 1 fen new coins. In addition to being announced by the Central Bank, this is to notify you. Cooperative members' store numbers and addresses (omitted)</p>
<p>Cooperative Agreement Limit</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association has 100 cooperative members who have accepted the entrustment of the Central Bank. Each day, the Central Bank will issue 40 boxes of 1 fen copper subsidiary coins, each box containing 200 yuan, for a total of 8,000 yuan. This is divided equally among 100 households, with each household receiving 80 yuan per day. The Central Bank's Issuing Department will no longer exchange. This was implemented yesterday morning. However, as of noon, it was still not universal in the market. Therefore, the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association decided to hold a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss universal exchange methods.</p>
<p>Smaller Shops Still Rushing to Exchange</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, the tobacco shops in Shanghai have seen a sharp increase in demand and have sent apprentices to gather outside the Central Bank every day to exchange subsidiary coins in turn. Before 8 AM, hundreds of people have been standing at the door, and they are still squeezing and refusing to leave in the evening. The daily exchange amount is about 20,000 yuan or more. Although the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association Cooperative 100 large tobacco exchange shops were entrusted to exchange yesterday, smaller shops still went to the Central Bank to request a continued exchange. More than 200 people were waiting at the door, and they did not disperse until noon.</p>

<h3>Public Concession Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing and Others Mediate and Resolve Road Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>To Take Care of Workers' Livelihood, Three Agreed-Upon Measures: Workers Satisfied and Will Resume Work This Morning</p>
<p>The strike by road construction workers of the Public Concession's Public Works Department was resolved yesterday through mediation by Yu Qiaqing and other Chinese directors of the board with the Public Works Department. Road workers are scheduled to resume work this morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Agreed-Upon Measures</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the road workers' strike, Public Works Department Chinese director Yu Qiaqing has been extremely concerned. Yu, in accordance with the workers' demands and for the smooth resolution of the matter, convened Chinese directors Guo Shun, Xu Xinliu, Xi Yushu, and others at the Shipping Club yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM to exchange mediation opinions. Subsequently, at 3:00 PM, the Chinese directors went together to visit Mr. Jemson, the head of the Public Works Department, to conduct negotiations. The negotiations proceeded very smoothly. To take care of the workers' livelihood, three measures were decided upon: ㊀ The original workers will not be terminated, but only changed to temporary workers; ㊁ When there is a shortage of work, if the workers do not want to use a lottery method to determine whether to work or not, they can still rotate as before; ㊂ The original workers will be given priority for employment, and new temporary workers will only be recruited when excessively busy. When not needed, the new workers will be stopped first. Mr. Jemson also indicated that, considering the road construction projects in the Public Concession, it is determined that workers will not be left without work even if changed to temporary workers. After more than an hour of negotiations, the Chinese directors then took their leave.</p>
<p>Full Resumption of Work This Morning</p>
<p>Road worker representatives Li Jingchun and four others, as instructed by Yu, went to inquire about the news at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Yu informed them of the results of the mediation with the Public Works Department by the Chinese directors. The representatives, satisfied that there would be work, expressed their deep gratitude to Yu. Subsequently, the representatives recounted the oppression they usually suffer from their foremen. Yu also promised to inform the authorities and pay attention to it. Moreover, Yu also planned to negotiate with the Public Works Department for other relief measures when work cannot be done due to rain or snow, in order to maintain the livelihood of the road workers. According to reporter inquiries, the road workers, after Yu's mediation, no longer insisted and have decided to resume work this morning. Furthermore, the Chinese directors will continue to make statements on this case at today's board meeting of the Public Works Department.</p>

<h3>Ten Points of Petition by Southwest Yi and Miao Chieftain Representative Gao Yuzhu</h3>
<p>Foreign Forces' Erosion and Intoxication of the Yi and Miao People is a Major Crisis: Requesting Central Government Relief and the Establishment of an Yi Affairs Consolidation Committee</p>
<p>Public Lecture at Sino-Western Radio Station Today at 4:00 PM</p>
<p>Southwest border Yi chieftain and Miao people's representative Miss Gao Yuzhu, after completing her affairs in Beijing, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, she conducted inspections in Shanghai, visited the war zone in Zhabei, and toured cultural institutions such as the Shen Bao newspaper. Today, she will give a public radio broadcast lecture. The reporter of the Shen Zhou News Agency specially inquired and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Visit to the Scars of the Shanghai War</p>
<p>Miss Gao came to Shanghai to report on the general situation of Yi affairs in the southwest and hopes that those who pay attention to border matters will assist in development. Yesterday morning, accompanied by Huang Jingwan and others, she visited the China National Goods Company and expressed satisfaction with the progress of the machinery industry. She also went to Zhabei to visit the scars of the "January 28th" Shanghai War and expressed indignation at the enemy's brutal acts. After returning, she visited the Shen Bao newspaper and the Liangcai Library. In the afternoon, she went to the Xujiahui Catholic Church and visited the Lianhua Company. She is scheduled to broadcast the recent situation of the Southwest Yi people at the Sino-Western Radio Station at 4:00 PM this afternoon. She will stay for a few days and then return south.</p>
<p>Foreign Forces Erode the Yi and Miao Nationalities</p>
<p>Last year, Miss Gao, along with petition representative Yu Shucai and others, went to Beijing and met with Chairman Lin, Chairman Jiang, and Madam Soong Mei-ling. She was greatly congratulated for her efforts to innovate the Yi people. The Southwest Yi and Miao nationalities are distributed along the borders of Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Kang provinces, with a population of no less than 25 million and a territory spanning thousands of miles. The people lead simple lives, and their character is brave, honest, and sincere. They are governed by chieftains, and the chieftains and the people are closely related, relying on each other for life. In the past, foreign forces penetrated deeply and tried their best to invade our chieftains, and used missionaries to bewitch our people, often instigating chieftains and Miao to break away from the Han people, promising large sums of money and new-style firearms as supplies. Unknowing Yi people were thus intoxicated, and some were willing to surrender to the rebels, while others relied on the power of foreigners to kill compatriots. The disaster reached a point where good chieftains and Yi Miao had no room for survival. Later, due to many domestic affairs and frequent border chaos, the foreign aggression was strengthened, and the hidden worries are a matter of concern.</p>
<p>Key Points of the Southwest Yi Miao Petition</p>
<p>In addition to foreign intrusion, the Yi Miao people are also suffering from banditry. The purpose of this petition in Beijing is to actively rectify and develop the Yi people and stabilize the border defenses. The petition items are: ㊀ Promote the culture of the Southwest Yi Miao; ㊁ Focus on Yi Miao education; ㊂ Adjust the policies for governing the Yi Miao; ㊃ Organize and train Yi Miao national armed forces; ㊄ Eliminate the Communist Party's redification policies in the Yi Miao ethnic areas; ㊅ Resist imperialist aggression; ㊆ Restrict corruption and devastation; ㊇ Focus on border party affairs to lead the Yi Miao nationalities; ㊈ Develop Yi land and enrich resources; ㊉ Allow the Yi Miao nationalities to elect several representatives to participate in the National Assembly, in order to demonstrate the principle of equality for all nationalities in the country. It also requested that the central government subsidize the development of the Southwest Yi Ethnic Cultural Promotion Association, establish a special Yi affairs agency in the central government, and allow the government to permit various chieftains to organize an Yi affairs consolidation committee in the border areas to be responsible for consolidating all Yi affairs.</p>
<h3>He Zifang Discusses the Need for Development in Yunnan Border Counties</h3>
<p>Languages and Writing Systems of Wufu and Other Places are Disconnected: This Visit is to Investigate and Learn from Experience</p>
<p>Yunnan is an important province in our southwest, and the people of the country pay close attention to it. However, the counties in the border areas, due to inconvenient transportation, are quite disconnected. The reporter of the Shen Shi News Agency met yesterday with He Zifang, the Major General Military Counselor of the Yunnan-Guizhou Pacification Headquarters and concurrently the magistrate of Wufu County, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Yunnan, to inquire about the recent situation on the frontier. Mr. He had been ordered by Chairman Long Yun to go to various counties in the border area for inspection, so he knew it very well. According to his account, President Sun had long been concerned about the development of the southwest, and Chairman Chiang was even more concerned about the Yunnan border cause. Since Chairman Long took office, he has followed the central government's policies and ordered his subordinates to work hard together. So far, major policies have yielded results, and all political, military, educational, and construction aspects have been improved day by day. This time, I came to Shanghai to investigate various new facilities here, and to learn from them when I return. Mr. He continued to talk about the situation in Pusi, Lancang, Wufu, and other counties in the border area. The area borders Siam, Burma, and Vietnam, and is of great importance to national defense. The mineral resources are especially abundant, but the people's knowledge is shallow, and all languages, writing systems, beliefs, customs, and habits are closer to Siam and Burma. The disconnection is evident. The province of Yunnan is rich in produce, with agricultural products including the famous Pu'er tea, camphor, platycodon, cotton, rice, etc. Mineral products include the famous gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, coal, tungsten, mercury, asbestos, and the most famous mica. However, due to the inconvenient transportation in border counties such as Wufu, the outside world has been unable to enjoy them. Due to the inconvenient transportation, exports to Siam and Burma are more common than exports to the country. However, there is no major development due to the inconvenient transportation. Therefore, the development of Yunnan's foreign trade and transportation to Siam is also very important. This time, I specially invited Xu Ge Ting, the executive committee member of the Siam Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and secretary of the China-Siam Association, to come to Shanghai to report on the situation in southern Yunnan to those who care about the Yunnan border and hope that overseas Chinese in Siam and all sectors of the country will develop it. Mr. He will not stay in Shanghai for long and plans to go to Beijing within a few days to report the situation of the border defense to the authorities and to discuss the construction of a new Yunnan province and the development of transportation.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Transportation Orders Airlines to Pay Attention to Aviation Safety</h3>
<p>Severe Punishment for Those Responsible for Accidents</p>
<p>In order to increase port shipping safety, the Ministry of Transportation issued instructions to China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation, stating, "Aviation transportation places the utmost importance on safety. Since the establishment of the company, aircraft accidents have occurred (for China National Aviation Corporation) twelve times, with eight aircraft completely destroyed, four partially damaged, five passengers dead, twelve injured, six pilots dead, seven injured, and one radio engineer dead; (for Eurasia Corporation) nine times, with seven aircraft completely destroyed, two partially damaged, nine passengers injured, three pilots dead, one injured, and one mechanic injured. As for the recent incident of the Sichuan aircraft burning to the ground in Chengdu, an overall examination of the causes of the past accidents reveals that management negligence accounts for the vast majority, and technical deficiencies cannot be excused either. Many accidents could have been prevented, but they resulted in huge losses, which is truly regrettable. It also has a significant impact on the public's reliance on the company and the future development of our national civil aviation. In order to enhance the company's future aviation safety, a solemn order is hereby issued that the company must strictly order its aircraft maintenance teams and the service personnel at each station and airport to be cautious and meticulously attentive in their routine management, inspection, and repair of aircraft, as well as the organization and maintenance of airports. Pilots must continuously study flight technology. In the future, in the event of an aircraft accident, once the cause is determined, those responsible should be severely punished. In addition, if the company's routes have frequently occurring drastic weather changes and there are places where radio stations have not been established, please increase the number of stations as soon as possible. Aircraft that should be equipped with direction-finding devices must be installed and properly secured within the shortest possible time to ensure flight safety. You must comply with this order and report back."</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Suzhou Carrier Wave Telephone is Smooth</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Suzhou carrier wave telephone, since its installation and trial operation last month, was officially opened on February 1st. Since its opening, the sound waves have been very clear due to the increased electrical waves, and the public feels it is very convenient. It is reported that the carrier wave components were manufactured by the German Siemens factory and installed in the Zhabei Branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the Suzhou Telegraph Bureau. It is the MK type, specially designed for long-distance clear lines with shorter distances, such as 60 to 100 kilometers. It can transmit voice services through frequencies of 80 to 140 kilocycles per second. On each pair of clear lines, it can increase the number of simultaneous telephone lines to as many as five. The components are small, easy to install, and easy to adjust, so it is beneficial to both economy and business. It is heard that the Ministry of Transportation will also install corresponding carrier wave components on busy lines such as Beijing and Shanghai to ensure smooth voice services and reduce waiting time.</p>

<h3>New Beijing Sent to Repair, New Ningxing Ship Temporarily Replaced</h3>
<p>Approved to Sail from Shanghai to Ningbo for the First Time Tonight</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo line's New Beijing Ship of the British Swire Shipping Company, after running aground outside Zhenhai, has been rescued and arrived in Shanghai for repairs. Because the repairs will take time, it has been decided to send the New Ningxing Ship (2,175 gross tons, 1,343 net tons, built in 1906) of the Sanbei Shipping Company's Shanghai-Hankou line to replace it temporarily. The notice is recorded below: Notice: Now that our company's New Beijing Ship is undergoing repairs in port, the New Ningxing is specially dispatched to replace it, starting from the 3rd of this month (Wednesday). In the future, it will still operate according to the usual schedule, sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and from Ningbo to Shanghai on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The ship docks at the New Beijing Wharf. We welcome your patronage.</p>
<h3>US Shipping Strike Ends, Huade Ship to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, the American shipping industry in this port will officially end tomorrow (the 3rd) due to the American shipping strike. In the period following, business will inevitably be extraordinarily prosperous. Yesterday (the 1st), preparations were made to avoid being caught off guard at the last minute. Employees of the Dalae Shipping Company and others believe that several ships will come to Shanghai from the United States in the second half of this month. Thus, the maritime trade that has been suspended for 94 days will be active again. Although there are no instructions or news from the United States, it is expected that a telegram will arrive in Shanghai within two days. It is expected that the first American cargo ship to arrive in Shanghai after the shipping strike is announced will be the Huade, which is chartered by the government and has not been affected by the strike. It sailed from New York around January 15th and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on March 2nd. Another sister ship, the Pu Jiang, also sailed from New York and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on March 23rd. This is one of the first ships to leave the American coast in the hope of resolving the strike. In addition, the American Oriental Company's mail ships detained in San Francisco, if the sailors vote to approve the termination of the strike, will be announced on Wednesday and will set sail west on Thursday.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Stipulates Regulations for the Management of Shipping</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs, in order to stipulate supplementary measures for Article 5 of the Regulations for the Management of Shipping and Merchant Ships by Each Customs, as ordered, issued a notice yesterday stating, "The text of Article 5 of the Regulations for the Management of Shipping and Merchant Ships by Customs has been amended as ordered. This customs issued Notice No. 1543 on August 29th, 1936. Now, by order of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, the supplementary measures for the said article are stipulated: If a merchant ship fails to reach the port where it was originally registered during the annual re-registration, it must be re-registered at another customs station. If it is difficult to obtain a new guarantee locally, a merchant ship trade association or reputable shop or bank may be found to sign and seal the guarantee in the application submitted by the shipowner or captain, ensuring that the shipowner or captain strictly complies with all customs regulations during the period when the customs station investigates whether the guarantee provided at the original registration customs station is valid. All merchant ship owners and captains are hereby informed. This notice is hereby given."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Replies to Chamber of Commerce's Promotion of National Rice Transportation to Guangdong</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance regarding the request of Guangdong Province to exempt foreign rice from taxes, requesting that it not be approved. The Ministry of Finance now replies to the chamber of commerce by telegram: "Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, I have received your telegram. Regarding the case of Guangdong Province requesting exemption from foreign rice tax, it has now been resolved by the Executive Yuan that only foreign rice purchased by the Guangdong Provincial Food Adjustment Committee will be allowed to pay half of the tax in cash and half on account, limited to the transportation of 300,000 metric tons, in order to address the emergency of the province's rice shortage. The customs duty is not exempted, the quantity is limited, and it is for the purpose of regulating food, which ultimately helps the sale of national rice in Guangdong. Protection is also involved. At present, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway is actively allocating more vehicles for the transportation of national rice, and the transportation cost of national rice, whether by train or ship, has been reduced. Rice merchants across the country should immediately understand the government's intention to protect domestic products, not have speculative intentions regarding the price of national rice, and not have a wait-and-see attitude regarding the purchase and transportation of national rice, in order to fulfill the responsibilities of the rice industry in regulating food. Work together to protect the sale of national rice. The Miscellaneous Grain Trade Association should promote the transportation of national rice to Guangdong for relief. I hope that your association will inform them accordingly, Ministry of Finance."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Gentleman Mu Shuzai Cremated Yesterday</h3>
<p>More than 500 People Attended the Funeral; Ashes Stored in a Copper Coffin</p>
<p>Shanghai gentleman Mu Shuzai passed away on the 30th of last month due to cerebral hemorrhage, which has been reported in various newspapers. The Mu family, in accordance with his will, cremated Mu's remains at the Jing'an Temple Public Works Department Cremation Ground yesterday morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Funeral Situation</p>
<p>After Mu's death on the 30th, the coffin was placed in the International Funeral Parlor. Yesterday morning at 8:45 AM, the remains were placed in a glass coffin and transported by a fire truck from the South City Fire Brigade, passing through Jiaozhou Road, Yuyuan Road, and Jing'an Temple Road to the Public Works Department Cremation Ground. Those who attended the funeral included members of the Shanghai City Defense Corps, the South City, Zhabei City Center District, Wusong, and Public and French Concession fire brigades, as well as Zhu Ziqiao, Wang Yiting, Gu Xin Yi, Huang Renzhi, Shen Xinqing, Huang Boqiao, Mao Zijian, Tan Boying, and more than 500 relatives and friends of Mu. Previously, the Mu family had followed his will and did not disturb relatives and friends, but people from all walks of life automatically went to participate, so the funeral procession was more than a mile long, extremely orderly and solemn.</p>
<p>Cremation Process</p>
<p>When the coffin arrived at the entrance of the cremation ground, it was carried by six members of the Shanghai South District Fire Brigade to the cremation ground. Those who attended the funeral stood in teams on both sides of the aisle and saluted. The remains were then repackaged into a specially made coffin for cremation and sent into the incinerator. This furnace is the latest equipment of the Public Works Department and burns with gas. All clothing, coffins, etc. had no metal objects, so after burning, in addition to the ashes that could be preserved, the rest was immediately gasified and dispersed, which was extremely fast. The family prepared another small copper coffin, about one and a half feet square, specifically for storing the ashes, to be kept for permanent worship and remembrance.</p>

<h3>Detailed Record of the Symposium on the Literary and Art Circles (Continued)</h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan: Six hosts, esteemed gentlemen, today, fellow members of Shanghai's literary and art circles have gathered together, and I am deeply honored to participate. At the same time, I feel that there will be frequent opportunities to meet with all of you gentlemen in the future, and I must thank the hosts for this. Just now, I saw the declaration of the Unified National Salvation Movement, and I was very pleased. I personally agree with the general principles of the declaration. I heard Mr. Fan Zhongyun say that he hopes everyone will express their opinions on the declaration, or nominate a few gentlemen to be responsible for making revisions. I have a few opinions, and I don't know if everyone thinks they are correct. Some gentlemen said just now that we should not discuss the left and right factions any more, so as not to cause disputes. I think this is very right. If everyone wants to do this, we should first have a common goal. If the common goal is determined, other trivial matters need not be mentioned. The saying "If a common belief is not established, mutual trust will not arise" means just that. If a common goal is not established, mutual trust will never exist. Now, a common goal has already been established, which is unified national salvation, and no one opposes it. In the future, we only need to work hard towards this common goal. But we must not only issue declarations; we must also express the spirit of unified national salvation in our literary and artistic works. Only then will unified national salvation become a reality. I see that this declaration has already mentioned "Every era has its own literature and art," "Every nation has its own literature and art," and "It is truly a manifestation of the era and nationality of our Chinese masses." In this era, the most important point in literary and artistic works is that they should be filled with a rich sense of nationality. In this way, on the one hand, literary and artistic works can meet the needs of the times, and on the other hand, they can unite the literary and artistic circles of the whole country, so that there will be no more slogans of any front. Whether it is the so-called people's front or anti-people's front, they are essentially inseparable from the entire nation and country. If the country is destroyed, what people's front can we talk about? Therefore, now it is only a question of how the entire nation should save the country. The entire nation cannot be preserved by a part of the people; we must use the power of the entire nation to protect all the people within the entire nation. We must not divide into any fronts. Therefore, China does not need any fronts, but only the unity and unification of the entire nation. In this critical period of national survival, all the petty personal grievances of the past within the nation must be completely eliminated under the major premise of saving the entire nation, and we must work together for the entire nation. Why couldn't the literary and art circles unite in the past? It was because they did not have a common goal. Mr. Wang Fuquan said just now that the reason why unity has not been successful in the past is because the left and right factions cannot agree. Frankly speaking, even within the left faction, it is not necessarily possible to be consistent. At the funeral of a leader of the left faction, they almost fought to the point of bloodshed over the position of commander-in-chief. Can this still be called consistency? This fully shows that the literary and art circles lack a great spirit and a fair mind. Engaging in literary and artistic movements in this way will probably not contribute anything to the country and the nation. Furthermore, within the left faction, there is a distinction between the so-called "national defense literature" and the mass literature of national revolutionary war. One side insists that national defense literature is correct, while the other side insists that the mass literature of national revolutionary war is correct. Frankly speaking, slogans cannot be eaten. What is the point of paying attention to these boring arguments? At this time, we do not need articles with outdated theories; we only need to consider how literary and artistic works can raise national consciousness and unite the national spirit. However, left-wing writers publish lengthy articles on these theoretical disputes in newspapers and magazines, causing readers to have headaches when they see them. One should know that the playwright has the playwright's ideas, and the director has the director's methods. During the performance, there is no need to explain how one wrote the play or how one directed it. Everyone only needs to watch your play to know whether it is well-written or well-directed. Otherwise, what is the use of thinking that one's "ideology is correct"? Therefore, I hope that the members of the literary and art circles will recognize the times. Originally, you gentlemen of the literary and art circles are undertaking a very important task. Half of the rise and fall of the country depends on guns, and the other half depends on pens. In the past, we scolded warlords, but now most soldiers are gradually awakening, uniting and working together against foreign enemies. But we intellectuals have not yet united, which is a pity. Intellectuals lead the times. The current era has reached the stage where the entire nation is working together for revival. If the literary and art circles do not quickly grasp this point and work together, then the literary and art circles will inevitably fall behind. How to distinguish between advancing and falling behind? I think it is not that the left faction is advancing and the right faction is falling behind. We must first recognize the times. Those who lead the times are advancing, and those who have not recognized the times and are still satisfied with old things are falling behind. Mr. Fan Zhongyun said just now that everyone agrees with talking about patriotism now. However, a few years ago, some people scolded him for being a patriot, thinking that being patriotic was falling behind at that time. Those who used to think that being patriotic was falling behind now suddenly feel that the country should be loved and no longer consider it falling behind. Also, a few years ago, if you talked about national defense, they would think you were falling behind because at that time they were talking about "internationalism" and saying that "workers have no motherland." If you talked about national defense, you would be a nationalist. But now national defense literature is the most "advanced." Isn't this a very bizarre and laughable phenomenon? Therefore, I say there is no such thing as advancing or falling behind; we only need to look at the needs of the times. The so-called national defense literature evolved from proletarian literature. Why did proletarian literature suddenly transform into national defense literature? This is due to the instructions of the Third International. Frankly speaking, imported communists are always more clever than homegrown communists. They saw that they could no longer implement the old plan. The environment has changed, and the plan should also be changed. Therefore, they had a resolution on what the People's Front in Spain should do, what the People's Front in France should do, and what the People's Front in China should do, and stipulated each one. They believed that China should now shout the slogan of resisting Japan, as resisting Japan is most likely to arouse sympathy. Therefore, in the literary and art circles, the slogan of proletarian literature was transformed into "national defense literature." This can be proven by the resolution of the Third International Congress. However, the above had already made a decision, but the Chinese Communist Party below and the so-called left-wing writers had not yet received the order and were still advocating proletarian literature. Only when they received the order did they immediately change to national defense literature. Why did they have to wait for the order of the Third International to change? This fully shows that they have lost their self-confidence. Therefore, the first step for us now is to restore the self-confidence of our literary and art circles. Gentlemen, you must know that the masses led by the literary and art circles are more numerous than the army. A commander or division commander leads at most several thousand or tens of thousands of people, while the readers led by the gentlemen of the literary and art circles are dozens of times more numerous than the soldiers commanded by the commander or division commander. Therefore, I hope that the members of the literary and art circles in the future will abandon their petty personal views and work together under the overall goal of national revival. I believe that the national revival of China will definitely receive great help from you all. Therefore, I very much hope that this declaration can mention "Work together to promote national consciousness, promote national sentiment, promote unity, and consolidate unity in literary and artistic works." I wonder what you gentlemen think of this. Secondly, as some have already said, our Literary Association should not only have those present today participate, but also hope that all members of the literary and art circles who are not present today will participate.</p>
<p>Shao Xunmei: Today, we are grateful to all of you gentlemen for gracing us with your presence and expressing many insightful views. On behalf of the six hosts, I extend our sincere thanks. Although the time for this symposium is short, and not every gentleman has the opportunity to express his grand views, we have obtained many valuable opinions that can be used as a reference for people in the literary and art circles across the country. Moreover, today's symposium is precisely the beginning of the collective efforts of literary and art workers. After the establishment of the Chinese Literary Association, we will have even more opportunities to meet and talk. Finally, I wish all of you present good health. (End)</p>
<h3>Supplementary Amendments to the Draft Regulations on the Collection of Taxes</h3>
<p>Continued Letter from Pan Xulun, Li Wenjie, etc. to the Income Tax Bureau (Continued)</p>
<p>C. The following are the points that should be supplemented and revised in the draft regulations on the collection of income tax on securities and deposits of the third category: ① Article 2 of the draft stipulates that "Stock interest refers to dividends," then it seems that share bonuses do not need to be taxed. It is a good thing to reduce the double taxation of company stocks in this way, but if a minimum limit is not set for dividends at the same time, then companies may modify their articles of association, cancel their dividends or official interest, and all income from shares will be in the name of bonuses. Then, the effect of this article will inevitably be to completely evade stock income tax. ② Article 2 of the draft stipulates that "Deposit interest includes the following items: ⓐ Interest on deposits received by banks and money shops; ⓑ Interest on loans from silver money businesses, foreign firms, groups, and individuals to companies and businesses." The second item not only has difficulties in interpretation in terms of wording, but also seems to have major problems in terms of meaning. First, what exactly is meant by the term "group" is unclear. Second, according to the wording of this item, strictly interpreted, loans from individuals to individuals, loans from companies, businesses, and groups to individuals, and loans from companies to companies and businesses are not included in the "deposit interest" referred to in this draft and do not need to be taxed. Is this interpretation correct, and does it have any meaning? All these become questions, so a clear regulation should be given separately so that people can understand. ③ Article 4 of the draft, "Interest arising from loans from banks and money shops and from inter-bank transactions between silver money businesses should be included in the operating income item for calculation, and deposit interest income tax will not be collected," is very appropriate, but the deposit interest income tax withheld from the deposits of profit-making institutions can still be deducted from the amount of income tax payable according to the provisions of Article 13 of the draft regulations on the collection of the first category. In reality, it is also equivalent to not collecting deposit interest income tax. Therefore, the application of the above Article 4 is not limited to the silver money business. Therefore, the last sentence of this article, "Deposit interest income tax will not be collected," should be changed to "Deposit interest income tax does not need to be withheld by the interest-paying institution" to be correct. ④ How to calculate the interest income of fixed deposits with lump-sum withdrawal should be added. Now, according to the calculation method in Article 7 of this draft regarding life insurance proceeds as part of deposit interest income, we propose a clause as follows: "For fixed deposits with lump-sum withdrawal, the portion of the lump-sum withdrawal amount that exceeds the actual deposit amount will be regarded as deposit interest income." ⑤ How to calculate the interest income of fixed deposits with periodic withdrawal, and when the tax amount should be withheld, should also be specified. For example, if the fixed deposit amount is 1,000 yuan, and it is scheduled to be withdrawn in twelve years, that is, 144 months, with a monthly withdrawal amount of 10 yuan, according to American precedents, there are two methods for calculating interest and paying income tax. First, the monthly amount of 10 yuan withdrawn in the first 100 months is regarded as a return of principal and is not subject to income tax. From the 101st month, the 10 yuan withdrawn each month is regarded as interest income, and income tax is withheld at the time of payment. Second, from the first month to the 144th month, the 10 yuan withdrawn each month is divided into principal and interest by precise calculation, and the income tax on the interest portion is withheld. Which method should we adopt in our country should be clearly stipulated. In our opinion, the first method is relatively simple and stable and should be adopted. The above is for Gao, Director of the Income Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and Liang, Deputy Director.</p>
<h3>Military Service Association Decides to Continue Service in Suiyuan</h3>
<p>If the War Does Not Expand, It Will End by the End of May</p>
<p>The Military Service Committee of the National Association of the YMCA held a meeting at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 12:30 noon yesterday to discuss the continued work matters due to the arrival in Shanghai of Xiao Siqian, Director-General of the Military Service Department in Suiyuan, and to welcome and comfort Xiao. More than ten people, including Zhang Jiapu, Liang Xiaochu, Lu Gan Chen, and Hu Yongqi, attended the meeting. During the meeting, Xiao reported in detail on the progress of the front-line service department and the needed items.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Work of the Service Department</p>
<p>Currently, the YMCA Service Department has a total of 21 people and 6 technicians working in Wuchuan, Bailingmiao, Jining, Taolin, Xinghe, Datong, and other places, which is very popular with the soldiers. Chairman Chuan is particularly preferential. This time he came to Shanghai and purchased a sound film projector at Qianghua Company to be transported to Suiyuan for screening to encourage the soldiers. A separate room was set up in the hospital specifically for wounded soldiers to write letters and handle remittances. The soldiers in the front line are very depressed, as all they see is a piece of yellow earth. Therefore, the service department has already gone to work in the front line. As for the Sui border, there are no Mongolian puppet bandits or traitors. The Japanese people in Sui are also not active, and it is very peaceful. However, rumors are rampant in the front line.</p>
<p>The General Assembly Decides to Continue the Operation</p>
<p>Xiao came here to contact the association for service work and to handle the period. Currently, because the front-line war has become peaceful and the wounded soldiers have gradually recovered, it was decided to aim for the end of May. The authorities' preference and welcome to the front decided to handle it until the end of May. If the war expands, the work will continue without interruption. At the same time, various encouragement efforts will continue to be actively carried out before the end of May. Xiao has completed his work in Shanghai, and has decided to return to Suiyuan this morning because of the importance of the work in the front line. According to Xiao, the main item needed in the front line is a large quantity. The soldiers value the need for items more than money.</p>
<h3>British Officials and Civilians in Shanghai Prepare to Celebrate the Coronation of the British Emperor</h3>
<p>Large-Scale Military Parade and Fireworks Display. The Racecourse Prepares to Accommodate 60,000 People</p>
<p>The coronation ceremony of the new British Emperor George VI will take place on May 12th. It is learned that British officials and civilians in Shanghai have begun preparing for a large-scale celebration. Mr. Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, will come to Shanghai to preside over the ceremony. It is scheduled to hold a large-scale military parade at the racecourse on that day. In addition to the British troops stationed in Shanghai, there will also be the British team and the White Russian team of the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps. The racecourse has prepared a large grandstand that can accommodate 60,000 people for viewing. In the evening, there will be a large fireworks display. The grand occasion is predicted to be unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Korean Independence Party Leader Yan Bingxue Escorted to Korea Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shenzhou Society reported that he left by the Anping Maru yesterday afternoon. Yan Bingxue, the leader of the Korean Independence Party, was arrested by the Japanese Consulate General's police station and has been detained in the Japanese police station for many days. It is learned that after investigation, it was decided that the Japanese side would escort him to the Korean Governor-General's Office for trial. Yesterday afternoon, he left on the Anping Maru under the escort of Nishio, the patrol minister of the Japanese police station, and Nishimura, the patrol.</p>
<h3>Tea Picking Season Is Approaching, Improving Tea Making Technology</h3>
<p>Qimen Establishes a Large Tea Factory, and Inspection Preparations in Tea Areas Are Underway</p>
<p>The improvement of tea-making technology has been promoted in recent years and has gradually made progress. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has actively carried out inspection of tea area origins. A monitoring office has been established in Shanghai. When the tea season arrives, personnel will be sent to various tea areas for inspection. Currently, preparations are underway. Anhui Qimen black tea is famous all over the world, but the manufacturing method is not good, which affects the quality. It is learned that a large-scale tea factory will be established in Qimen, limited to the capacity of making 10,000 boxes, and the latest machinery will be used for manufacturing.</p>

<h3>Drug Dealers Are Cautiously Tried</h3>
<p>The Garrison Command Ordered Five Points to Be Noted</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau recently ordered its subordinate branches to follow the order of the Garrison Command No. Fa Zi Er Ba Wu San. It has been found that the two-year deadline for drug prohibition has expired. Since January 1, all drug users arrested should be sentenced to death in accordance with the law. After that, the Bureau should handle this type of drug case with special caution to avoid discrepancies. The following items that should be noted are listed for the Bureau Chief to follow: ① Drug users arrested should be sent to the Department immediately, so as not to lose the timeliness and fail to find the truth. ② The seized evidence should be marked separately for each defendant. ③ The personnel in charge should record the name of the drug user who was seen using drugs on the spot to avoid errors. ④ The drug suspects arrested at the same time should be sent to the Department together with the case for questioning to testify. ⑤ The detained drug dealers should first verify their fingerprints to prove whether they are repeat offenders.</p>
<h3>The Twelfth Group Wedding</h3>

<h3>Hongchang Pawnshop Is Accused of Embezzling Pledged Items</h3>
<p>A Diamond Ring of Great Value. Refusal to Redeem</p>
<p>Wu Yunfu, a native of Nantong at No. 6 Tongfu Lane, Fuxu Road, hired lawyer Ge Zhitan to sue Chen Yaoming, the manager and shareholder of Hongchang Pawnshop at No. 1 Hongde Lane, the eastern end of Jules Da Road, Fuxu Road, in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for embezzling pledged items and requesting investigation. According to the indictment, the plaintiff urgently needed a</p>
<p>Diamond ring</p>
<p>worth two thousand two hundred and seventy yuan on December 24th of the Republic of China Year 24. He entrusted his relative Shen Suigeng to pledge it at Hongchang Pawnshop, managed and opened by the defendant, for 500 yuan. At that time, he inquired that the pawn period was twelve full months, and a red stamp stating that it was twelve full months was affixed to the pawn ticket as proof. In October of the 25th year of the Republic of China, the plaintiff's friend, the owner of the item, was in a hurry to return the diamond ring. The plaintiff also could not afford to redeem it, so he returned the pawn ticket to his friend to redeem it with his own funds. The friend of the owner</p>
<p>Was also tight on money</p>
<p>and could not redeem it, so he entrusted a jewelry broker to sell it to avoid being confiscated after the pawn period expired and suffering losses. When he handed the pawn ticket to the broker to see the goods in the pawnshop, he was refused by the defendant's pawnshop staff, who claimed that the diamond ring had expired long ago and had been confiscated. After the friend of the owner informed him, the plaintiff was shocked and entrusted Shen, the original handler, to go to redeem it with funds, but was still refused. After repeated negotiations, the pawnshop staff said that the</p>
<p>Red stamp</p>
<p>color did not match and should be in accordance with the blue text printed on the pawn ticket, which stated eight full months. If it was not redeemed after the expiration date, it would have been sold long ago. The defendant's pawnshop used this trick to deceive the pawnbroker and dared to consider the pledged items that had not yet expired as expired and disposed of them without authorization. This was clearly a crime under Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law and should be</p>
<p>Investigated in accordance with the law</p>
<p>and also incidentally requested the return of the original diamond ring through civil litigation. According to the complaint, the court summoned both parties to the court for interrogation yesterday by Judge Chen Shuoying. Both parties and their lawyers arrived at the court. After a detailed interrogation by the court, it was ruled that the case still needed investigation and questioning of witnesses, so it was adjourned to 2 pm on the 9th for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Plans to Establish a Branch in Yangon</h3>
<p>In order to actively develop overseas banking business, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Bank of China to quickly establish a branch in Yangon, Southeast Asia, to facilitate the sale of national goods and to facilitate overseas Chinese to remit money to the motherland to purchase goods. It is learned that the Bank has instructed the Singapore branch in Southeast Asia to select staff to investigate the industrial, commercial, and overall financial situation in that area. As soon as the report arrives in Shanghai, it can be started. As for the selection of personnel, there is currently no formal decision. After the branch is established in the future, the business scope will be the same as ordinary banking business, and special emphasis will be placed on overseas Chinese remittance business. Loans to various industries will be provided as much as possible, depending on the needs of the local situation. It is heard that the official establishment period is around March or April of this year.</p>
<h3>Lu Genlin Swindles Masseuses</h3>
<p>Successively Swindled Three Gold Rings, Which Were Pledged for Expenses. It Took Half a Month to Be Arrested and Detained for Investigation</p>
<p>On the night of the 19th of last month, a sudden visitor came to the Sanmin Massage Parlor at No. 5, Lane 442, Haining Road. He selected a woman named Zhou Xiaomei to massage in the room. According to him, he was Zhang Yipeng, a famous actor of the Great Stage, and wanted to invite Zhou and another masseuse, Li Axiang, to go out to watch a play together. During the conversation, he caught a glimpse of each of the two women wearing a gold ring on their fingers and falsely claimed that the</p>
<p>Colors Were Not Good</p>
<p>and there were no names on them. He took the opportunity to take off the rings from the two women, saying that he would go to the silver shop to buy two more of the same kind and give them as gifts. The two women were young and ignorant and were deceived. They went out together. They first went to the Weiya Restaurant on North Sichuan Road for dinner. In the middle of the meal, the guest suddenly said he was going out to buy something and told the two women to wait a moment. He then went to Sanmin Massage Parlor again and went to another</p>
<p>Masseuse</p>
<p>Wang Gendi, falsely claiming that Zhou and Li were already watching a play in the theater and asked her to come and borrow a gold ring. Wang was unaware and rashly handed it over. Unexpectedly, he swindled three gold rings worth ninety-three yuan and then disappeared without a trace. Zhou and Li waited for a long time and the guest did not return. They realized that they had been deceived and had to pay the bill and return to the massage parlor. They also learned that</p>
<p>Wang Was Also Deceived</p>
<p>so they reported to the police and asked them to arrest him. It was not until the previous day that the Hongkou Police arrested the swindler. He confessed that his name was Lu Genlin, a native of Shanghai, 25 years old, and confessed that the three gold rings he had swindled had been pledged at the Lao Fengxiang Silver Shop on Nanjing Road. They ordered him to be detained and notified the victims to prepare seventy-eight yuan and two cents and four cents to</p>
<p>Retrieve the Original Ring</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, he was escorted to Criminal Court No. 5 of the First Special Court. Zhang Shizhu, the police lawyer, prosecuted the defendant Lu Genlin in accordance with Article 329 of the Criminal Law for fraud. He also stated the case, saying that a certain guiding agency at No. 7 Hankou Road also had a similar case of being swindled. The police requested a postponement because they had not yet investigated. After Judge Pan questioned Zhou Xiaomei and the other three women about the circumstances of the fraud, the defendant also pleaded guilty. The court ordered the defendant to be detained and adjourned the hearing to Saturday.</p>
<h3>Gambling Bandits Set Up a Scheme to Rob</h3>
<p>All the Bandits Were Arrested and Sentenced Separately</p>
<p>Le Yuan, a woman from Ningbo, was passing near Yuezhou Road, Gongping Road, at around 9 am on the 22nd of last month when she saw a poker gambling stall. The woman had 50 yuan in legal tender hidden on her. She went forward to watch the gambling and was confused by the people. She took out the ticket from her pocket and was about to enter the game when she was robbed of the full amount and fled in a swarm. The woman urgently reported to the Huishan Police Station. Chinese Detective Zhou Guisheng and Detective Liu Decheng arrested the bandits Cai Xuehai, Wu Guisheng, Zhang Jinlong, and Wang Zhenhe, natives of Jiangbei, and the woman Wang Chen, at the Ruyi Teahouse on Jiashing Road and Huajie Shengji Road, and escorted them to the First Special District Court. It was found that there were a total of seventeen bandits at the time. Please postpone the detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiecai came to court for a continued hearing. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the Municipal Council, stated that the accomplices could not be arrested during the postponement. He also stated that these gambling bandits used three-card poker as bait, and countless villagers were victimized. Please impose severe punishments. The old pushcart inquired clearly and sentenced Cai Xuehai, Zhang Jinlong, and Wang Zhenhe to one year and two months of imprisonment, and Wu Guisheng and Wang Chen to one year of imprisonment and a three-year suspended sentence.</p>
<h3>Swire Resumes Shanghai-Ningbo Route</h3>
<p>Renting the New Ningxing from Sanbei Company – Resumption of Service Expected Today</p>
<p>Swire Company's new vessel, the "New Beijing," mistakenly navigated the wrong route near Zhenhai port last month and struck the Laotaipo Reef. After taking on water, the company dispatched a ship to unload passengers and cargo. Cement and wooden planks were used to patch the damaged bow compartment, and the ship was refloated, towed to Zhenhai for repairs, and then sailed back to Shanghai for extensive dry-dock repairs. Unexpectedly, during this voyage from Zhenhai to Shanghai, the "New Beijing" again encountered</p>
<p>Stormy Seas</p>
<p>The captain, concerned about the ship's structural integrity, did not risk proceeding and returned to Zhenhai. It is now planned to further reinforce the hull before attempting to sail to Shanghai again. The Ningbo route, however, has been temporarily suspended due to the lack of a suitable passenger vessel to replace the "New Beijing." This suspension has lasted for two weeks. Fortunately, business losses have been mitigated through a profit-sharing agreement with China Merchants Sanbei Ningshao and other companies. However, passengers traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo have experienced</p>
<p>Crowded Conditions</p>
<p>on the Ningshao Company's "New Ningshao" vessel, which operates on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Latecomers often find no available passenger seats. Furthermore, with the end of the lunar year approaching, Shanghai natives from Ningbo are customarily returning home for the holidays. In recent days, the number of passengers departing from Shanghai to Ningbo on the Ningbo-bound ships has increased several times compared to normal days. Swire Company recognized the necessity of deploying a substitute vessel and, as it did not have a suitable ship available, negotiated with Sanbei Company to rent its "New Ningxing" to temporarily operate the</p>
<p>Ningbo Route</p>
<p>Shanghai will continue to have departures on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, while Ningbo will have departures on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, recognizing the convenience this arrangement provides for fellow villagers returning home at the end of the year, expressed his support. The rental agreement with Swire has been approved, and the "New Ningxing" is expected to arrive in Shanghai from the Yangtze River today to unload cargo before being handed over to Swire. Swire will then deploy it to Ningbo today. The "New Ningxing" has a carrying capacity of 2,175 tons, can load 2,600 tons of cargo, has a draft of 17 feet 4 inches, has 10 first-class cabins, 18 official cabins, 148 second-class cabins, and accommodations for 451 third-class passengers. Swire is renting this vessel to continue and revive the Shanghai-Ningbo route. Once the "New Beijing" is repaired, it will resume service, and the rented vessel will be returned.</p>
<h3>The Qin Zhen Burglary Case</h3>
<p>Valuable Items Purchased in London and Paris Stolen – Maid's Infiltration Confirmed</p>
<p>Qin Zhen, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan of the National Government, residing at 97 Masnan Road in the French Concession, has reported the continuous theft of valuable items since September of last year. The stolen items include nine watches and various currencies. Recently, gold watches purchased in Italy, a small knife purchased in London, and a gold signet ring purchased in Paris during Qin's overseas inspection were also stolen, despite being carefully stored. Qin reported the thefts to the French Concession Police, requesting an investigation. Detectives Li Tiqing and Wang Wenhua were assigned to the case and identified Qin's maid, Yu He (29 years old, from Anhui Province), who had access to the residence, as a prime suspect. Yu He was taken into custody, and she confessed that her husband, Yu Shixue (32 years old, from Anhui Province), had instigated the thefts. She claimed that the stolen goods were handed over to her husband for pawning or sale. Investigations revealed that objects began to disappear after He started working at the Qin residence in February of last year. Detectives have begun investigating Yu Shixue and attempting to recover the stolen items, with the intention of handing the case over to the Criminal Division of the Special First Court for further investigation today.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing in the Lu Guanzeng Couple's Dispute Over Embezzled Jewelry</h3>
<p>Plaintiff and Defendant, Each Accompanied by Their Lawyers, Appear in Court – Separate Interrogations Conducted for a Week, Witnesses Still to be Summoned</p>
<p>Lu Guanzeng, a wealthy businessman from Suzhou and owner of the Yuanli Yuchang Pawnshop in Shanghai, married Cheng Shuwen, daughter of Cheng Huting, a shareholder in the Fuyuan Money Exchange, in March of the 13th year of the Republic (1924). They have three children. Recently, misunderstandings arose between the couple, and Cheng returned to her mother's home, refusing to return to the Lu family. Attempts at mediation by relatives and friends were unsuccessful. Lu then filed a lawsuit in the Wuxian District Court, demanding that Cheng return home and return the</p>
<p>Jewelry Taken</p>
<p>with her. This case remains unresolved. Cheng has also filed a complaint with the New Zha Police Station in Shanghai against Lu Guanzeng and Mr. Yu, the manager of the Yuchang Pawnshop, accusing them of jointly embezzling jewelry worth over 110,000 yuan that she had stored in the Yuanli Pawnshop. The police have filed a lawsuit in the Special First Court, and preliminary hearings have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce continued the hearing in the Second Criminal Division. Lu and Cheng attended with their respective lawyers, Ling Qihong and Wu Linkun, Wang Fusheng, and Jin Henian. First, police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated that one of the plaintiff's witnesses, Wu Ruisheng, was out of town and unable to attend, but that Chen Huiquan was present. He requested that the court conduct separate interrogations of the defendants and witnesses. Wu Linkun requested several corrections to the previous hearing's record. The court first inquired about the circumstances of Lu Cheng's delivery of the jewelry. She stated that she and Lu Guanzeng brought the jewelry box to Shanghai. Lu escorted her to her mother's home, and she then handed the jewelry box to Lu for storage in the Yuanli Pawnshop. She could not remember whether anyone witnessed this. The court then asked if reconciliation was possible, given previous mediation attempts. She replied that there had been no talk of reconciliation. Wu Linkun stated that his lawyer and the plaintiff's lawyer had discussed the matter briefly, but the defendant insisted on</p>
<p>Continued Cohabitation</p>
<p>while the plaintiff wanted a divorce, making progress impossible. The defendant had two pieces of evidence: first, that the plaintiff had rented a safety deposit box at the Fuyuan Money Exchange in the name of San Ji in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933); second, that neither the letter from the plaintiff's lawyer to the defendant nor the letter to the defendant's uncle mentioned any</p>
<p>Embezzlement of Jewelry</p>
<p>The court then ordered Mr. Yu and witnesses Chen Huiquan and Zhu Shaoqing to leave the courtroom and questioned Lu Guanzeng. Lu stated that the plaintiff's jewelry was always kept by her. Only the "six gifts" given at the wedding were placed by him in an iron box in the Yuanli Pawnshop, and he kept the key. However, on Lunar New Year's Eve last year, she asked him for the key, saying she needed to use the jewelry for a wedding banquet. He instructed Yu to accompany the plaintiff to Shanghai, and later</p>
<p>Yu Informed Him</p>
<p>that the plaintiff had taken the jewelry box. The plaintiff refused to return home after returning to her mother's house. Despite mediation by relatives and friends such as Bei Runsheng, Qin Runqing, Liu Zhengkang, the plaintiff's sister Ge Cheng, and her husband Ge Wenqing, he had given the title deeds and seals to a piece of land to the plaintiff for safekeeping. However, the plaintiff later changed her mind. The court then questioned Lu and Cheng about the number and value of the jewelry items. Yu was then brought to the court and testified that he had been ordered by Lu Guanzeng to</p>
<p>Accompany the Plaintiff</p>
<p>to Shanghai to retrieve the jewelry. Around the tenth day of the first lunar month last year, they went together to retrieve the jewelry box, with the plaintiff saying she wanted to place it in the Fuyuan Money Exchange. Next, witness Zhu Shaoqing testified that the plaintiff went to the Yuanli Pawnshop and took away the jewelry box. Chen Huiquan then testified that he had sold the plaintiff 300 pearls, 60 small diamonds, and a diamond ring worth over 7,000 yuan. After reviewing the testimony, Judge Zhan Liangce adjourned the case to summon Ge Cheng and Ge Wenqing for further questioning.</p>
<h3>National Temples Hold Three Days of Peace Prayers</h3>
<p>From the 11th to the 14th - The National Peace Protection Association Issued a Notice Yesterday</p>
<p>The National Peace Protection Association of Chinese Buddhists in Shanghai yesterday issued a notice to all temples and monks across the country, stating that all Buddhist temples, Buddhist organizations, virtuous bhikkhus, and elder lay Buddhists should be aware that the world situation is dire and the national crisis deepens. The enemy is entrenched in our vital areas, and internal strife is increasing. While we strive for human intervention, we must also rely on the power of Buddha to dispel disasters. It is difficult to eliminate misfortune without universal encouragement and dedication. Therefore, we are initiating a three-day nationwide prayer for national peace, starting on the 11th of the second month of the lunar calendar (March 4). We respectfully request all temples, organizations, and Buddhist followers to recite the Benevolent King Prajna Paramita Sutra and Mantra (or the Great Compassion Dharani and the name of Avalokiteshvara) during this period, activating the three karmas (body, speech, and mind) and sincerely dedicating the merit to eliminate the suffering of all beings and pray for the peace and security of the nation. May we turn the crisis of the world and quell the anger of the Asuras. We beseech your divine compassion and vows to jointly generate great dedication, rejoice in participating, and strive bravely and diligently. This will not only benefit our nation but will also illuminate the entire Dharma Realm. In addition to sending requests to the Buddhist Association of China to inform all branches, this notice is hereby issued by Honorary Chairman Wang Zhen, Zhu Qinglan, Chairman Dabi, Vice Chairmen Chang Xing, Qu Yingguang, Huang Molan, and Guan Jiongzhi.</p>

<h3>The Year-End is Difficult to Pass: Sun Chengshan Dies by Poison</h3>
<p>Sun Chengshan, a native of Funing, aged 50, living in a shack north of Datong Road (Zhonghua New Road) in Zhabei, had a wife, daughters, and a total of seven family members. He usually made a living pulling a rickshaw. Recently, due to soaring prices, his income could not cover his expenses, resulting in a heavy debt burden. Moreover, with the end of the lunar year approaching, he was obligated to repay his debts. However, he had no way to earn money and thus conceived a desperate idea, committing suicide by poisoning. Yesterday afternoon, at 1:30 PM, his family members noticed his pale complexion and rushed him to Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road. Dr. Lu Guanyuan diagnosed that Sun had taken a large amount of arsenic, and that more than four hours had passed. The poison had spread, and the blood vessels had all ruptured. It was impossible to save him. He was instructed to return home quickly, and he died shortly after entering the door. The case was reported to the Taiping Temple Police Station under their jurisdiction. After learning the details, the local bailiff was instructed to report to the Shanghai District Court to request an autopsy.</p>

<h3>Xu Yi Accuses Tan Zhuohong of Abuse of Power and Wrongful Judgment</h3>
<p>Detained for Sixty-Eight Days - Request for Bail Denied</p>
<p>Tan Zhuohong, a former clerk of the Criminal Division of the Shanghai District Court, was dismissed by the Ministry of Justice for colluding with Shanghai lawyer Yang Shaopeng in bribery and for dereliction of duty. He was transferred to the Wuxian District Court, where the initial trial sentenced Tan to eight years in prison and Yang to six years in prison. On appeal, the Jiangsu High Court reduced Tan's sentence to four years and Yang's to three years and six months. The second instance appeal is still in progress. However, during his</p>
<p>Dereliction of Duty</p>
<p>while in office, Xu Yi, a former Shanghai lawyer, was also one of the victims. Therefore, Xu Yi filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the District Court, accusing Tan Zhuohong of violating Article 125, Paragraph 1, Clause 3 of the Criminal Law, which concerns abuse of power and wrongful judgment. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Judge Li Xuedeng opened the court session. Xu Yi, 31 years old, a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong, stated that he was formerly a lawyer and currently resided at 13, Lane 171, Tangshan Road. He stated that the defendant, Tan Zhuohong, during his tenure as a judge in the court, colluded with Yang Shaopeng. Last year, Cheng Li Tianzhi falsely accused the plaintiff of forgery. The original agent was Li Shirui. It was later learned that the case was being heard by the defendant, who then used the pretext of appointing Yang Shaopeng as an agent to</p>
<p>Bribe Him</p>
<p>4,000 yuan. As a result, the defendant unlawfully arrested and detained the plaintiff and wrongly sentenced him to four months in prison. The plaintiff then appealed to the Jiangsu High Court and was eventually acquitted, but had already been detained for 68 days. Within half a year, the defendant and Yang Shaopeng openly and blatantly solicited bribes, which were reported, and the Wuxian District Court sentenced them separately. The defendant's acceptance of bribes in the case of the plaintiff's trial was one of the crimes identified in the initial trial judgment. However, when the case was appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, it was obscured and considered that the evidence for that part of the initial trial was</p>
<p>Still Insufficient</p>
<p>Therefore, the judgment was reversed. According to the part of the defendant accepting bribes, it is difficult to avoid abuse of power and wrongful judgment. It has not yet been adjudicated in the previous case, and in the infringement of national legal interests, there is also the intention to infringe personal legal interests, so a lawsuit is now being filed. According to the scope of detention of the defendant during the trial, it is narrower than the scope of investigation. Reference to Article 20 of the Criminal Procedure Law is very clear. The Ministry of Justice repeatedly issued three orders and five declarations last year to</p>
<p>Vigorously Implement Bail</p>
<p>Responsibility, it can be seen how cautious the detention of criminal defendants should be. However, it was found that Xu was falsely accused of forgery by Cheng Li Tianzhi. During the investigation, he was not only not detained, but he was not even bailed. He obeyed three summons and attended the hearings on time. Moreover, Xu Yi had a fixed residence and a normal profession in Shanghai, and there were no other defendants in the case. It can be considered that there is a risk of claiming decorations. In short, Xu Yi had no reason to be detained. However, the defendant ignored the legal order and suddenly ordered him to be detained in the sultry heat. At that time, the defense lawyer He Baiqian</p>
<p>Tried His Best</p>
<p>To assign or to grant bail. The lawyer Wang Jianhang, who was in the audience, was also willing to jointly assign the defendant and asked to file a statement for instructions, but no instructions were given. It was clear that he knew that the reason was unjustified, so he perfunctorily waited until the day of the verdict. Xu Yi was sentenced to four months in prison and repeated his previous request. The defendant also said, "File a statement for review." Since then, on July 20, July 30, and August 17 of that year, I repeatedly filed statements, thinking that even if the crime was identified by the defendant, the circumstances were very minor. According to the law, there was no reason to be detained, and</p>
<p>Regardless of Approval or Rejection</p>
<p>According to the provisions of Article 201 of the Criminal Procedure Law, there should be a ruling. The defendant knew that the application could not be rejected according to the law and had received a bribe. It would be difficult to meet the person who bribed him. He shelved the application and did not make a ruling, making it impossible to appeal. After the case was submitted to the High Court, the defendant instructed him to apply to a higher level to shirk responsibility. Furthermore, the defendant's verdict obliterated all the counter-evidence favorable to Xu Yi and made empty statements, saying, "The prosecutor's words are credible and reasonable," etc., and forcibly convicted him by favoritism. The defendant did not mention it, and the court instructed that the case should be suspended for file transfer and another hearing date should be set.</p>

<h3>"Yunxiao Yao and Tong" Dispute Resolved Through Yi Jing's Apology</h3>
<p>Issue No. 13 of Shanghai's Yi Jing Magazine contained an article titled "The Yao and Tong of Yunxiao," which contained many defamatory words. The Singapore Hakka General Association, the Chao'an County Dapu Association, the Tinglong Guild Hall, the Zhennian Guild Hall, the Wuhua Fellow-Villagers Association, the Meixian Fellow-Villagers Association, and other Hakka groups from Chao'an jointly confronted Yi Jing Magazine in a serious manner, appealing to all sectors of society. Li Dachao, Section Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Government, intervened vigorously, pointing out that during this time of national crisis, it was important to unite the national front and not allow disputes to arise that would hinder the nation's revitalization. He proposed a three-point solution: ① Yi Jing would publish an apology in major newspapers in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore; ② Yi Jing would regularly introduce Hakka history and origins to the best of its ability; ③ Yi Jing would formally issue a letter stating its position and apologizing. Jian Youwen, the person in charge of Yi Jing, agreed to this and sent letters to the Singapore Hakka General Association and the Chao'an Hakka Association. It is reported that Li Dachao received a reply from the Hakka groups in Chao'an who were confronting Yi Jing Magazine. The letter stated that after reviewing the proposed solution for Yi Jing's publication of the "Yunxiao Yao and Tong" article, the third meeting of their joint association resolved that since Yi Jing acknowledged its mistake, they were willing to accept the three proposed solutions put forward by Li Dachao to unite the national front, and that this should be recorded for future reference. They requested that this information be conveyed to Yi Jing Magazine and that they must implement the three proposed solutions as soon as possible. Li then forwarded the letter to Yi Jing Magazine, urging them to promptly resolve the dispute with the Hakka community. Thus, the dispute between Yi Jing Magazine and the Hakka community has been resolved.</p>
<h3>International Drama Society to Perform "In Japan"</h3>
<p>The Chinese International Drama Association, formed by Chinese artists studying in Japan, held its second performance last April, staging the plays "Moonrise," "Infant Slaughter," and "Night Light." These plays were highly regarded by the people of Tokyo. The leaders of the association, Wu Jiansheng, Cao Yu, and others, spurred on by this honor, have been working even harder in their research and actively promoting the association's affairs. They are currently preparing for their third and fourth performances, scheduled for early March. Cao Yu has been publicly recommended as the playwright and has written two plays titled "Sunrise," the plots of which are highly original and reveal profound philosophies about the human condition, with the ability to improve and guide society. Wu Jiansheng is in charge of directing and stage design, and the supporting roles are expected to be finalized within days.</p>

Wang's art has reached a state of divine transformation.</p>
<h3>Barber Shop Employee Dies Tragically; Fugitive Murderer Wanted</h3>
<p>Chuan Tinghui, a barber shop employee from Yangzhou, aged 28, who worked at the Dongfang Barber Shop at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Beijing Road, had a dispute with his colleague Wang Donggao on the morning of November 23rd last year. Wang violently beat Chuan with an iron bar and pushed him from the third-floor mezzanine, causing serious injuries to his abdomen, waist, and arms. He was sent to Renji Hospital, where internal injuries were found to be severe. The incident was reported to the police station at the time, but it was not accepted. Chuan Tinghui eventually died in the hospital on January 16th of this year, while Wang Donggao fled without a trace. Chuan's wife, Tao, hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to file a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened the eighth criminal court to hear the case. The plaintiff, Fu Tao, tearfully recounted the events. The court ordered that Wang Donggao, who was at large, be placed on the wanted list. The trial will be suspended until Wang Donggao is apprehended.</p>
<h3>Robbery at Zhaofang Alley</h3>
<p>At around 6 PM last night, three robbers suddenly entered the Hu family's residence at No. 2 Zhaofang Lane, Zhaofang Li in the city. One of the robbers held a gun and warned them not to make a sound. They stole over a hundred yuan in cash before fleeing. After the robbers left, the victim reported the incident to the local police station, requesting an investigation.</p>

<h3>Wife Files for Divorce After Husband Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the Sixth</p>
<p>Li Zhiming, a local resident of No. 38 Gaojia Lane, Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai West, is 29 years old. In 1934, he was sentenced to life imprisonment by the local court for murder. The Supreme Court upheld the original sentence in the final appeal, and he was sent to prison. His wife, Qin Guizhen, is 27 years old and currently resides at No. 17 Wangjia Lane, Da Xi Road. Citing her husband's life imprisonment, which makes it impossible for them to be together in this life and wastes her youth, she has hired lawyer Sun Qiying to file for divorce in the civil court. The petition states that the defendant is</p>
<p>Imprisoned and Unable to Provide Support, Requesting a Divorce. The plaintiff married the defendant in the winter of 1930 through a matchmaker. Since their marriage, their relationship has not been harmonious. The defendant indulged in vulgar habits and repeatedly tricked the plaintiff into giving him her jewelry and clothes from her dowry, which he then pawned. The plaintiff had hoped that they would be lifelong partners, but he continued to wander about. When she tried to persuade him, he became angry. The plaintiff, wanting to maintain harmony, did not say much. However, disaster struck in April 1934 when the defendant had a conflict with Yao Minggao, with whom he was living, and</p>
<p>Killed Yao Minggao.</p>
<p>Yao's wife immediately fled with the plaintiff. As time went on and their expenses ran out, the defendant instructed the plaintiff to return to her mother's home to find a way to make a living. After the plaintiff had been staying with her mother for a few days, the defendant could not wait any longer and secretly came to Shanghai. Consequently, he was arrested and imprisoned on the tenth day of the eighth month of the same year. After the initial trial, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. The appeal was rejected, and the case was finalized after three trials. He was sent to prison. Upon hearing this, the plaintiff was heartbroken. Unfortunately, the defendant's family had no permanent property, and he had long been</p>
<p>Estranged from his Family.</p>
<p>Moreover, his father was living in his second wife's mother's home. As a result, the plaintiff, who was six months pregnant, was alone and helpless. If she stayed with her mother for too long, she would be burdening her elderly parents. Furthermore, the defendant's relatives were mostly untrustworthy and constantly pressured her to remarry, using deceitful words and threats to oppress her. The plaintiff, being an ignorant woman, could not bear such treatment. Therefore, she is requesting a divorce to save her life. Yesterday, Judge Chen Ping held a court hearing and brought Li Zhiming from prison. Qin Guizhen testified to the previous events and waived her claim to the return of her dowry. When questioned about this, Li Zhiming</p>
<p>Looked Unhappy,</p>
<p>Saying that she was taking advantage of his misfortune and betraying years of love. He did not want a divorce because receiving the summons was very stressful. He had ten reasons and requested a retrial after preparing his defense. The judge said that was not necessary because the case was clear and there were no issues with the judgment. He asked if he had anything to say at that moment. Li replied that he requested the return of the 500 yuan betrothal gift and compensation for</p>
<p>All Wedding Items.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that the plaintiff's statement that she had a child was false because the child was born last year, but he had been in prison for two and a half years. He asked how she could have become pregnant and given birth. He claimed that she had a lover named Wang and that was why she wanted a divorce. He requested permission to provide further reasons for a retrial. The judge stated that the facts of the case were clear and declared the debate closed, with the sentencing scheduled for the afternoon of the sixth of this month. Upon hearing this, the defendant declared in court that he would appeal the verdict. The judge ordered him to be taken back to prison.</p>
<h3>Concubine Flees with Belongings Due to Abuse by First Wife</h3>
<p>Wang Gengtao Files a Complaint Requesting Investigation</p>
<p>Wang Gengtao, a local resident aged 48 who works as an accountant at the Kailuan Mining Bureau, bought Dai Xiulin, a woman from Suzhou (aged 24), as a maid seven years ago. However, Wang was attracted to Dai's beautiful appearance and slender figure. Before long, they engaged in physical relations, and Wang took her as a concubine, living with his first wife. However, Wang's first wife was fierce and often abused Dai. Wang, fearing his first wife, secretly built a golden house for Dai at No. 9 Beidi Lane, Beidi Road in the French Concession to hide her away. But because Wang feared his first wife, he rarely visited Dai, and the relationship between the old husband and young concubine could not last. Dai Xiulin lamented her misfortune and, on the morning of the 28th of last month, fled with her own belongings, including clothes, gold jewelry, a watch, a suitcase, a camera, and a kerosene stove. When Wang discovered this, the woman was gone. He reported the incident to the French police, requesting an investigation. It was not until the day before yesterday that they learned that Dai Xiulin and her lover, Zhao Baiqiao, were hiding at No. 7, Lane 16, Caojiaqiao, between Yu Yuan Road and Hede Road in the Public Concession. Detectives, accompanied by Wang, went to the address with officers from the Public Concession police at 5:00 AM one morning and arrested Dai Xiulin and Zhao Baiqiao. After taking them to the Public Concession police station, they only brought Dai Xiulin and her belongings back to the French police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the eighth criminal court of the Second Special Court, where Judge Qiu Huanying interrogated them. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the police department, presented the case, stating that the police department still needed to investigate the case and requested a postponement. The plaintiff, Wang Gengtao, then claimed that he had been living with the defendant for seven years and that she had previously stolen his passbook and fled, but was found. This was the second time she had stolen his belongings and fled, and she was having an affair. He requested an investigation. When questioned, Dai Xiulin confessed that she fled because she could not bear the abuse. She was still wearing thin clothes in the cold weather, so she took her own clothes and left to choose her own path. She did not want to be the plaintiff's concubine. She denied stealing his gold watch, claiming that he had hidden it under her pillow to frame her. Upon reviewing the confessions, the judge ordered a postponement for further investigation. The defendant was released on bail of 500 yuan pending investigation.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Relief Association Cables US to Express Condolences for Flood</h3>
<p>Initial Remittance of 100,000 in Cash; Relief Goods to be Shipped Gradually</p>
<p>The various charitable organizations in Shanghai initiated a fundraising campaign for the American flood and decided to borrow 100,000 yuan to send for relief efforts. This has been reported in the newspapers on several occasions. Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the All-Circles Joint Relief Association, telegraphed Mr. Clayton, Chairman of the American Red Cross, yesterday to express condolences and to send 100,000 yuan to the United States to aid the victims. The original telegram is as follows: "To Mr. Clayton, Chairman of the American Red Cross, Upon hearing the news of the devastating floods in the Mississippi River, the people of our country are deeply concerned and express sympathy for the displaced victims in your country. In the past, when China suffered from natural disasters, people in your country often provided assistance in a friendly spirit. Now that your country is unfortunately afflicted, our country, to show mutual assistance, has jointly launched a fundraising campaign by organizations such as the Shanghai China Red Cross, the China Child Welfare Association, the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Association, and the All-Circles Joint Relief Committee. I, on behalf of the aforementioned organizations, am sending 100,000 Chinese national currency to meet urgent needs. There are also Chinese-produced goods worth 100,000 yuan, which will be shipped to the United States for relief purposes as soon as the procedures are completed. At that time, I ask you to distribute these meager relief funds and goods to the victims and to convey the deep sympathy of the people of our country. This is our sincere hope. Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the Shanghai Relief Committee, February 2nd."</p>

<p>National Goods Special</p>
<h3>Guanxian Hua on the Laudable Inventor</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Because we advocate for national goods, we often pay special attention to, respect, and admire national industrialists, especially the many inventors who are tenacious and outstanding.</p>
<p>In the future, we would like to dedicate more space to chronicle domestic industrialists who invent things. Famous inventions are certainly worthy of respect, but ordinary, anonymous inventors, especially those from the working or lower-ranking white-collar classes, who rack their brains and expend countless efforts, overcoming countless difficulties, to achieve something, are particularly valuable and bring glory to the history of national industry.</p>
<p>Recently, the Department of Applied Chemistry at Nankai University invented proteins from cottonseed oil, and extracted glucuronide and formic acid sugars and other substances from corn cobs. We greatly admire this and believe that the university has achieved some success after decades of schooling. However, universities are places for academic research, and it is their duty to invent things. But for a tool worker in a machinery factory to invent something after seven years of hard work, such as Mr. Gong Xinglei, who invented the folding umbrella for both sunny and rainy days, is particularly commendable.</p>
<p>Mr. Gong is a 25-year-old tool worker from Hangzhou, Zhejiang, at the Puzhen Machinery Factory on the Jinpu Railway. He only received elementary education. He has been a tool worker at the Puzhen Machinery Factory since 1928. In his spare time, he enjoys reading books and newspapers on invention, which sparked his strong interest in invention. Several years ago, he aspired to create a pocket-sized, dual-purpose umbrella. He spent his evenings making samples and molds. His colleagues ridiculed his fantasies, and his superiors criticized him for being foolish, even threatening to dismiss him if he did not stop his research. Gong was unmoved and continued his work in his spare time. His roommates complained that he was disturbing their sleep and frequently reproached him. Only the landlord, appreciating his sincerity, was tolerant. After 18 months of research, he created the first prototype and applied for a patent from the Ministry of Industry. The Ministry of Industry rejected it because the structure was not refined. Gong did not lose heart and continued his research. After another three years and eight months, he revised and improved it and submitted a second application for a patent from the Ministry of Industry. The Ministry rejected it again because it was not flexible in use. Gong continued his efforts and gradually modified it until it was finally completed, and he recently obtained a patent from the Ministry of Industry. In total, it took seven years. This laudable inventor is worthy of our praise and admiration. We hope that countless inventors in the country will continue to be featured in this publication, which is not only an honor for this publication, but also the glory of the national goods industry.</p>
<h3>National Goods Exhibition and Opening Up the Way to Townships</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>Autumn is ripe, the harvest is abundant, and the new grains are on the market. This is the only time for national goods manufacturers to go to the inland townships. In the past, national goods exhibitions in the inland often did not yield good results. Here, I feel that there are several points that national goods manufacturers need to improve if they truly want to open up this vast road.</p>
<p>1. Extensive Publicity The minds of the masses in the townships are simple, which is an undeniable fact. However, their curiosity and willingness to try new things are inversely proportional. In the past, national exhibitions in the inland often neglected this point and considered publicity unimportant. Even a small grocery store in a township must be heavily promoted beforehand to attract customers, fearing that they will not be thorough enough. How should this large-scale shopping mall use interesting publicity to attract attention? Moreover, farmers in the townships "follow the crowd." The quieter the storefront, the more they will shy away. Therefore, widespread publicity is also an indispensable condition in the townships.</p>
<p>2. Clear Arrangement Undoubtedly, there are no larger houses in the townships to allow for a comfortable arrangement. Doors, samples, advertisements, and flags are hung in a chaotic manner. Inside, the goods are stacked in a disorderly manner, and some of the boundaries are unclear. Being in this environment is like falling into a fog. There is no way to stay and watch, nor can one choose the goods with ease. In fact, although the house is small, one can save space to allow for room to stand. Although there are many goods, one can arrange them in an orderly manner to give people a clear understanding.</p>
<p>3. Kind Attitude Secondly, most farmers in the townships are relatively awkward and shy in their attitudes and actions, especially women, who can be unbearably trivial about the goods and their prices. In the city, shop assistants who are accustomed to service will unconsciously reveal their disdain and impatience. As a result, they may be cold and unresponsive to customers' inquiries, and they may monitor or ridicule those who are not neatly dressed, making simple farmers uneasy. Although these situations are sometimes caused by language barriers, if the service personnel can be more kind and friendly, the farmers will be receptive.</p>
<h3>National Goods Joint Company and the Future of National Goods</h3>
<p>— Gong Jin</p>
<p>Recently, the National Economic Construction Movement Committee, in conjunction with the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperative Association and various national goods factories, companies, and commercial introduction agencies, discussed the establishment of a National Goods Joint Company. It is reported that they have reached a satisfactory agreement with the Ministry of Industry. Preparations for the establishment will begin soon. This is another good sign for the future of national goods.</p>
<p>Since the people of our country, deeply aware of the harm of economic aggression by the great powers, began to advocate for national goods, they initially only knew how to shout slogans and implement passive inspection methods. More recently, they have learned to organize groups, formulate concrete plans, and focus on positive measures, such as establishing various national goods associations, holding national goods years, and recruiting home visitors. Moving from empty talk to practical action is a sign of progress in the national goods movement. However, many people still have two difficulties in purchasing national goods. One is the difficulty in distinguishing between national and foreign goods. In the past, national goods were simple and easy to identify. In recent years, imitation of foreign goods has progressed rapidly, and the products sometimes surpass those of foreign countries. In addition, some unscrupulous merchants take advantage of the patriotic psychology of the Chinese people and pass off foreign goods as national goods, which makes it even more difficult for purchasers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish places that specialize in selling national goods. In the past, various places have held national goods exhibitions and fairs to sell national goods, but these were mostly temporary and ineffective. A permanent national goods company is needed. The second is the lack of a complete national goods sales venue. With the progress of modern culture, the variety of daily necessities has increased significantly. If consumers have to go to many different places to purchase the goods they need, it is very troublesome and uneconomical in terms of time. Therefore, department stores have emerged to meet this need, gathering various goods from different places in one place, allowing consumers to obtain all the daily necessities they need for clothing, food, housing, and transportation in one place. The Sincere and Wing On stores in Shanghai are examples of this. Unfortunately, they are mostly a collection of foreign goods and a distribution center for imported goods. A large-scale national goods department store of this kind is still lacking. If the people of our country can recognize this and establish such companies in various places, it will greatly help the development of the future of national goods.</p>
<h3>A Fundamental Approach to Ms. Xu Qu Gong’s Advocacy of Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>— Ms. Lin Wen</p>
<p>My experience with interviews is increasing daily, and I now feel no difficulty whatsoever. Yet, recently, I suddenly encountered such an unexpected setback! Although I don't feel discouraged, each day doesn’t go as smoothly as I'd like. One gloomy morning, I went to Heping Village and knocked on the doors of eight houses, but the replies were always: "They're out," "They're sick," "No one's home." Some people sat in the parlor for ten minutes or more, only to say that the person wasn't home! From the first lane all the way to number twenty-one of the very last lane, the door was opened by the same maid. I handed her my business card, and she invited me into the parlor. I carefully listened for sounds inside. From afar, I heard a woman's voice saying, "Please ask her to sit for a while!" The maid brought out tea, and soon a hostess, nearly fifty years old, with a kind manner and simple clothing, speaking in a Beijing accent, came out and smiled at me, saying, "I saw in the newspaper that you had arrived, and I have been looking forward to it every day. The other day, two women passed by my door, peering inside. I thought it was you, the interviewer, and hurried to open the door, only to be disappointed that they were carrying cards and notebooks to solicit donations for building a school. No wonder enthusiastic female interviewers for the nation are facing unexpected obstacles due to the uneven quality of people and things. Today, I have finally met you, and we can talk freely..." I believe her remarks are worth publishing. The following is Ms. Xu Qu Gong's conversation:</p>
<p>㊀ Our country's industry has been progressing rapidly recently, and domestic products are not lacking in high-quality items. However, according to customs import reports, the amount of imported cosmetics has been increasing at an alarming rate year by year. The reason for this is simply that the consumers are generally women of the propertied class. But fundamentally, it's because domestic cosmetics lack suitable products! For things like face powder, perfume, and facial soap, the principle should be that they don't damage the skin and are hygienic. All cosmetic merchants should cooperate and openly research together, aiming to defeat foreign goods, and not prioritize profit or competition within the industry. On the one hand, we must rely on the literary advocacy and publicity efforts of noble ladies and wealthy women. Hopefully, this will lead young women who tend to imitate to follow suit, and it won't be difficult to make domestic cosmetics active in the market in the shortest possible time!</p>
<p>㊁ Students in various middle and large schools in Shanghai, except for elementary school students who have some awareness of patriotism and promoting domestic goods, have a weaker sense of national concept at the middle school and university level! Most of their minds are Westernized, and everything they need for clothing, food, and housing is imported. Western suits are made of foreign materials; social interactions require four meals; furniture is purchased from foreign stores. They have become accustomed to this, to the point where it is irreparable! Moreover, schools do not have prescribed uniforms, which not only fosters extravagance but also directly contradicts the promotion of domestic goods. It is hoped that people with concern for national affairs will find ways to petition the education authorities to order all schools nationwide (especially in Shanghai) to prescribe student uniforms, with raw materials to be sourced from domestic goods. This would not only promote a simple and unadorned style but also achieve the effect of promoting domestic goods!</p>
<p>㊂ Domestic goods manufacturers should ideally contact schools and authorities of various organizations to set up domestic goods sample display areas in each school, displaying various valuable domestic goods samples. Each sample should clearly state the name of the producing factory and the telephone number of the purchasing department of that factory, so that those enthusiastic about using domestic goods can purchase them at any time. At the same time, manufacturers can offer schools and organizations special preferential treatment: that is, those who shop with a certificate can be given a discount. This method has been implemented by the Tianjin YWCA, and Shanghai can follow suit. As for elementary schools, the principals can be asked to give brief talks to elementary school students during weekly assemblies about the evil schemes used by people from certain countries to sell food in our country: such as adding white powder to white sugar; adding white stone chips to white rice; adding chemical poisons to salted fish, causing chronic poisoning after consumption. All of this can be explained in detail to elementary school students, so that they know the necessity of promoting domestic goods in their pure minds, and instruct them to spread the word to their families and friends at any time. Isn't this a good way to fundamentally promote domestic goods? (To be continued)</p>
<h3>On Salesmanship (II)</h3>
<p>— Ding Kai</p>
<p>Dealing with counterparts requires not only research and discussion but also detailed psychological analysis. Harvard University Professor Copeland used psychology to test and analyze the motivations of customers buying goods and made them public. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Original Class (The purchasing function comes entirely from nature without any reason. Salesmen should cater to this instinct.)</p>
<p>(1) Being different from others (2) Being worthy of competition (3) Special achievements (4) Maintaining health (5) Protecting young children (6) Satisfying appetite (7) Promoting ambition (8) Pleasing to the eye (9) Maintaining safety (10)崇尚時髦</p>
<p>B. Emotional Class (Due to emotional impulses, salesmen do not need to move with reason.)</p>
<p>(1) Increasing beauty (2) Physical comfort (3) Family happiness (4) Maintaining cleanliness (5) Occupying as one's own (6) Beautiful demeanor (7) Entertainment (8) Promotion (10) Sightseeing</p>
<p>C. Rational Class (Customers are well-prepared when buying. Sellers must explain the advantages in detail.)</p>
<p>(1) Sturdy and durable (2) Convenient application (3) Increased efficiency (4) Unparalleled economy (5) Good quality (6) Attentive service</p>
<p>We have seen Mr. Copeland's psychological analysis, and at the same time, we must also study the "sales channels" issue. If we consider "sales channels" from an economic point of view, then sales itself becomes a tool or item. From the manufacturer to the distributor, then to the door-to-door salesman, to the final consumer, all the various processes that are gone through are used by sales itself as a tool to seek profit. At this point, we believe that factory managers should simultaneously use three psychological studies:</p>
<p>A. Adapting to the market channels in the buying and selling process and catering to its interests;</p>
<p>B. Understanding the consumer's psychology and paying attention to their desires and convenience;</p>
<p>C. Catering to customs and paying attention to its metabolism.</p>
<h3>Introduction to the Function of Pocket Umbrellas for Both Sunny and Rainy Days</h3>
<p>The pocket umbrella for both sunny and rainy days has three functions: (1) Convenient to carry. This umbrella is similar to a flashlight, 9 and 1/3 inches long, and the diameter can be reduced to 1 and 1/2 inches, which can be hidden in a pocket. (2) For both sunny and rainy days. To use it, first take the sliding ring of the umbrella, pull out the umbrella handle inside, and after opening it, it is the same as an ordinary umbrella. When retracting, take the sliding ring of the umbrella with your left hand, take the handle of the umbrella with your right hand, and then turn your left hand to the right and your right hand to the left. When it doesn't move, pull the sliding ring down, and push and retract the umbrella handle upward at the same time, and then put it into a thin rubber bag. Mr. Gong is very willing to cooperate with others or transfer the patent rights to others.</p>
<p>Size and weight of pocket folding umbrellas</p>
<p>(Large, for men) The diameter after shrinking can be reduced to 1 and 1/2 inches, the length is 9 and 1/3 inches, and the weight is 1 pound, which is 6 taels lighter than ordinary umbrellas (produced by Shanghai Fu Factory). The size after opening is the same as an ordinary umbrella.</p>
<p>(Small, for women) The diameter after shrinking can be reduced to 1 and 1/8 inches, the length is 9 and 1/3 inches, and the weight is more than 9 taels. The diameter after opening is 36 inches. (Gong Xinglei, Design Department, Puzhen Machine Factory)</p>
<h3>The National Goods Movement in Various Ports along the Yangtze River (Part 2)</h3>

<p>▲ Hankou There is the Hankou Municipal National Goods Movement Committee, which is based on central strategies to plan the city's national goods movement work. It is jointly organized by 15 organizations, including the Hankou Special Municipal Party Department, the Pacification Commissioner's Office in Hubei, the Hankou Municipal Government, the Wuhan Garrison Command, and the Hankou Chamber of Commerce. It has three departments: general affairs, publicity, and investigation. The office is located in the municipal party department and is currently headed by Mr. Yi Bao Xun. Hankou has a national goods market, and various newspapers publish national goods special publications from time to time. Wuchang's commercial activities are second only to Hankou. Currently, a ten-mile-long street is being developed. After Mr. Lu arrived, the Director of Education, Mr. Cheng Qi Bao, once convened a meeting of all sectors. In the future, Wuhan and Hankou are preparing to jointly form the Hubei Provincial National Goods Movement Committee.</p>
<p>▲ Changsha The national goods movement has achieved remarkable results, with the "Hunan People's Association for Promoting National Goods to Save the Nation"! The current standing committee members are Mr. Zhou Ding Yu, Mr. Huang Ji, and Mr. Ling Wei. There are three groups under it, with Mr. Xiang Rong Ting as the director of the Red Weaving Group, Mr. Zhu De Ling as the director of the Publicity Group, and Mr. Gong Zhong Sun as the director of the Review Group. The gentlemen and ladies of Hunan have a reputation for hard work and practicality! The provincial capital has a magnificent National Goods Exhibition Hall that cost 700,000 gold! The buildings are splendid and stand tall, creating a large base for promoting national goods! It seems that there are few such facilities in the country. The second, third, and fourth floors are exhibition halls, and the lower floor is a sales market. Embroidery, porcelain, minerals, cotton, and general merchandise are displayed in a spectacular manner. Collecting these local products is truly not an easy task. Adjacent to the exhibition hall is an entertainment venue, attracting people to stop and linger. Changsha's well-organized national goods movement is truly worthy of emulation across the country, far from sitting and talking without taking action! Mr. Lu finally said: Promoting national goods should not be just empty talk, but should be promoted with plans. The above-mentioned provinces and cities, party and government leaders, have made considerable efforts and enthusiasm in promoting national goods, and it is hoped that the central and local governments will have a unified name, and the main members are still young men and women students.</p>

<h3>The Chanyu Proposes Marriage</h3>
<p>— (Sun Jingwen)</p>
<p>Recently, while reading history, I saw that after Emperor Gao of Han died, the Chanyu Modu even sent a marriage proposal to Empress Lu, "I am a humble ruler born in the swamps, raised in the open fields of cattle and horses. I have come to the border several times, wishing to travel in China. Your Majesty is independent, and I live alone. Two rulers are not happy, and there is no way to entertain myself. I wish to exchange what I have for what I do not have."</p>
<p>At that time, although China suffered such humiliation, Empress Lu was furious, but she did not dare to send troops to the Xiongnu. She had to politely decline Modu's joking request, replying, "The Chanyu does not forget our humble village, and bestowed a letter. Our humble village is frightened and has been planning since the retreat. I am old and weak, my hair and teeth have fallen out, and my steps are unsteady. The Chanyu has misheard and is not worthy of making himself sweat. Our humble village is innocent and should be forgiven! I have two chariots and four horses to offer for your frequent drives."</p>
<p>I suddenly realized that the demands of the invaders are arbitrary, and the invaded dare to be angry but dare not speak out, and still have to try to use sweet words to delay. However, we must know that Emperor Gao of Han originally used the policy of appeasement and marriage, first offering his own princess to Modu in order to seek temporary peace, which finally made Modu turn his thoughts to his mother-in-law, Empress Lu.</p>
<p>"A weak country has no diplomacy" has been the case since ancient times. The policy of appeasement will only arouse the insatiable ambitions of the invaders.</p>
<h3>The Newly Opened Xiang Gate in Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Bi Li</p>
<p>Suzhou used to have six gates: Lu, Qi, Lou, Feng, Pan, and Xu. Later, Jin and Ping gates were added. Recently, because the Sujia Railway has been opened to traffic, the first station away from Suzhou is between Lou Gate and Feng Gate. Passengers entering the city must detour through Lou Gate, which is very inconvenient. Therefore, a Xiang Gate was added between Lou and Feng gates.</p>
<p>Now, Xiang Gate has been completed. The two characters "Xiang Gate" in running script, inscribed by Yu Jingtang, are on the city gate. The other city gates are all adjacent to bustling streets, but this one is very different. Inside the city is a clean and quiet street, along a clear stream. A corner of an ancient temple is revealed among a neat row of tall trees. Outside the city, a more beautiful natural picture unfolds. Just outside the city gate is a long wooden bridge, spanning the vast city river. The river here is wider than outside Ping Gate, so the bridge has twelve arches, comparable to the Baodai Bridge. The bridge has not yet been completed, and I followed a group of children and walked over it adventurously. What an interesting moment!</p>
<p>Across the bridge is a belt of wheat fields and water marshes intertwined. Seeing those water marshes makes one think of side dishes of taro, tender lotus root, red water chestnuts, and white water bamboo shoots. I walked slowly along the river, watching the sparse sails leisurely flowing on the river; the shadows of the sails fell on the ancient city walls surrounded by green vines. Within this ancient city, three tall spires are revealed. Everything is so quiet and solemn, only light white clouds swept over. Suddenly, the sound of a bell came from afar, startling the crows on the spires, reminding the tourists of their thoughts of returning home, and dispelling all silence.</p>
<p>Friends who go to Suzhou to play, when you are tired of visiting Tiger Hill or Lion Grove, don't forget that there is such a beautiful and poetic picture outside Xiang Gate.</p>
<h3>On the Usefulness of Daughters</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Ah Gen, the old tea room servant who resigned two years ago, is now wearing riding breeches and a呢大衣, smoking a cigar, and riding in a shiny private car. He often comes to our office to play. Our director treats him like an honored guest, gets along very well with him, and often invites him to dinner. At the same time, it is rumored that our director, who is always complaining about being poor, has private financial dealings with him, but this matter has not been confirmed. However, how Ah Gen became so rich is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Four or five years ago, that was after the January 28th Incident, everyone knew that Ah Gen was in a very poor situation because his home was destroyed by artillery fire, and his two sons, one a typesetting worker and one a leather factory worker, were unemployed. At the same time, his three daughters, who were working as female workers in the factory, could not find jobs that earned five or six cents a day. At that time, the whole family's livelihood almost completely depended on his monthly income of nearly twenty yuan, so his lunch was three large pancakes every day. It is said that the morning and evening meals were not so sumptuous.</p>
<p>The pressure of hunger and cold forced his three daughters to embark on a less honorable path to earn food and clothing. Initially, they were all private prostitutes, and then they changed their profession to female tea room servants. Three years ago, the eldest daughter sneaked into the film industry to become a supporting actress. The second daughter went to a small dance hall to become a dancer. The youngest daughter worked as a waitress in a coffee shop. A year later, the second daughter was married by a comprador as a concubine. The youngest daughter had a relationship with a wealthy artist and lived with him. During that period, his eldest daughter also switched from the film industry to the dance industry, and quickly became a popular dance star. Even more gratifying, his two unemployed sons were able to support themselves due to the help of their second sister, who was married to a comprador. Therefore, when Ah Gen resigned two years ago, his three daughters subsidized him a total of about three hundred yuan per month.</p>
<p>In the past two years, his eldest daughter was hired by a famous banker and was favored in the household. The youngest daughter broke off her relationship with the artist and married a bureau chief as a stepmother, going to a certain northern province to be an official's wife. According to our director, Ah Gen now is very different from two years ago and has at least sixty to seventy thousand yuan in his hands. Although the two sons are nothing special, his three sons-in-law are really unbelievable. So these days, it is more useful to have daughters than to have sons. Ah Gen is a good example.</p>
<h3>The Living Depend on the Dead</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Shanghai is really a strange society. Some people eat by fraud, some people eat by intimidation, but this is still the living earning the living's money. "Bai Xiang Ren" sit with their legs crossed at the tiger stove all day long, dressed warmly and eating well. Their skills are "extraordinary." What is even more strange is that the living depend on the dead for food.</p>
<p>This time, due to handling the funeral of my deceased wife, I was given a new insight, at least for the first time for me.</p>
<p>Death is originally the greatest misfortune. Coffins, bedding, and silver ingots all cost money. "Losing both people and money" is the most unfortunate of misfortunes. But in addition to the legitimate burial expenses, there are all kinds of expenses that cannot be named. These expenses are not for the dead, but are extorted by many living people.</p>
<p>As soon as the white paper strip "Family has a funeral" was posted, sure enough, immediately a gentleman in a呢大衣and a copper basin hat ran in. The stranger was indeed a stranger, but he was not here to offer condolences. When I went up to ask the purpose of his visit, he said very honestly, "The little brothers in this street are asking for some expenses." Expenses, I heard, were rather strange. I declared to him, "Friend, someone in my family has died!" But he replied even more honestly, "Yes, we live off the mountain if we are near the mountain, and we live off the water if we are near the water." As a result, I confusedly gave a dollar to send him away. Unexpectedly, another group of "little brothers" came, also asking for expenses. Thus, I had to deal with it two, three, or four times.</p>
<p>The coffin carriers opened their mouths to ask for money again. "It's all contracted to your office," I solemnly declared, but it was ineffective. They said, "As long as you make life exquisite for us, we will take advantage of the tea money." The dead person was lying on the board, and there was no way, so I had to pay. After the encoffining was completed, the lacquerers used putty to fill the coffin seams. As usual, they opened their mouths to ask for money, saying that they only had a fixed wage in the office and relied entirely on the bereaved family to reward them. The words were pitiful enough, and needless to say, I paid.</p>
<p>The "escort pass" for fifty people cost two dollars, but "passing" was still a problem. The "little brothers" on the road demanded "toll money." At the office, someone helped light incense candles and silver ingots. The twenty strings of yuanbao prepared to be burned for the "earth god" were snatched away by an old woman as if to honor her, and as a result, hands stretched out to ask for money before leaving.</p>
<p>They are all living people who live off the dead. Even "dying" is not easy in Shanghai. It is really a strange society.</p>
<h3>The False Phoenixes</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 10 (Su Pa Sends a Tender Poem, Miscasting the Golden Flowers, Autumn Letters Add to the Sorrow of Yellow and Withering)</p>
<p>Mrs. Jiang said, "According to what you say, he is lovesick." The eldest daughter-in-law interjected, "Mother, you believe Xiao Ju's nonsense." Mrs. Jiang said, "He may not be talking nonsense. This Meng Lan child, her mouth is full of reform. But she is so sickly and melancholic, she has become a Lin Daiyu-style girl. Naturally, some things also make her unhappy. But in a family like ours, with plenty of food and clothing, and everything going smoothly, she shouldn't be frowning all day long." The second daughter-in-law was younger, and could not fully hide her words in her heart, so she smiled at Mrs. Jiang and said, "I think it is because she has eaten the loss of reform. You also know the thing that makes her unhappy, right?" Mrs. Jiang took the water pipe on the table and sighed. Xiao Ju quickly lit a paper coal and sent it over. Mrs. Jiang smoked without answering. The eldest daughter-in-law and the second daughter-in-law were facing each other, and they exchanged glances twice. So, the question that could just be discussed stopped again. But under this situation, it moved the second daughter-in-law a little bit of compassion. That day, she stopped talking. The next day, she thought of a way to comfort Meng Lan. This day, it was a dark day, and the sky was full of fragmentary dark clouds. Meng Lan came back from school and saw that several pots of newly opened chrysanthemums were placed on the tea table in the business hall. Especially this pot on the desk was the best. It was planted in a small Yixing porcelain mud vase. The vase was liver-colored, red with black color. Big belly, small mouth of the vase, from which two chrysanthemum branches stretched out. The one stretching out on the left was longer, the leaves were long and thick and ancient green, the left and right were contrasted, and there was no lack of a piece. At the top was a delicate petal of light yellow chrysanthemum, as big as a small rice bowl. The petals were so fine, so fine that they were like a pinch of silk cotton, drooping lightly. The branch on the right was short, with a small flower bud as small as a winter melon date. He threw the schoolbag on the bed, clapped his hands and said, "Good flower, good flower, who got this for me?" Xiao Ju followed upstairs and answered, "The second daughter-in-law got it from her mother's house. She said that you will be happy for a while after seeing this chrysanthemum, and it is indeed true." Meng Lan lay on the edge of the table, looked at the chrysanthemum for a while, and sighed, "It is still the sister-in-law who is a caring person, and sent me a few pots of chrysanthemums to relieve my boredom. But when the west wind rolls the curtain, people are thinner than the yellow flowers. Seeing the chrysanthemum only adds to my withering." Xiao Ju said, "Miss, are you saying that the flower is not good?" Meng Lan laughed and said, "Nonsense, why would I dislike such a beautiful flower. You go downstairs and invite the second daughter-in-law, I will thank her in person." Xiao Ju agreed and left, but she didn't come back for a long time. (121)</p>

<h3>Weekend Customs of Various Countries</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Saturday is the last day of the week. People work hard for six days of the week, and by Saturday, everyone feels relieved and looks forward to Sunday, the day of rest, to recover from mental and physical fatigue. Taking advantage of the gathering of reporters from various countries for the World Games in Berlin, the German magazine *Die Woche* inquired about the weekend activities of people in various countries from famous reporters, resulting in a very interesting record.</p>
<p>In England, on Saturday afternoon, the complex business situation gradually becomes sparse and cold. The hustle and bustle on the streets of London noticeably decreases. Sunday is a solemn religious day. Telephone calls from various places no longer mention commercial matters. If this sacred spirit is insulted, then that person's usual intentions must be very evil. Such sinful people will be respected and kept at a distance by society. Sunday afternoons are for children to play freely, and adults also begin their activities. However, they must follow God's commands and engage in labor until twelve o'clock. Therefore, the English do not return to their usual mood until after twelve o'clock on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>In Bulgaria, stopping work at one o'clock on Saturday afternoon is considered a moral principle. Sunday is the happiest day for Bulgarians, and most plan to visit friends and relatives. The first visit is usually to the sweet home of newlyweds. The housewife cheerfully prepares delicious dishes. From morning to night, they happily wear clothes as beautiful as those on stage. Sunday is a day for the people of Bulgaria to return to their childhood, playing games that children can do all day long. In hiking groups, there are always adults mixed in with the children. In winter, it is customary to go skating with the family.</p>
<p>In France, when the clock strikes twelve on Saturday, people leave work and go home. Between seven and eight in the evening, they are busy tidying up at home; this is a French custom. After finishing, they discuss plans for Sunday, with young women always being the first to suggest ideas. If there are young women in the family, then their plan will usually be adopted. They don't like traveling by train, they don't like staying in hotels, and they prefer to go to forests and lakes. They spend most of their time driving cars and playing dominoes. Parks are the best places to bask in the sun, but they are not that interesting.</p>
<p>Outdoor camping is the most common plan for Sunday in Poland because Polish people really like driving cars, and there are many forests. Those who cannot leave their homes on Sunday are considered the most unfortunate, so even cats and dogs go out together. Women sing songs, and men simply listen quietly beside them.</p>
<p>Unlike women in other countries, Italian women do not like going out, so weekend trips are rare. They skillfully decorate their homes on weekends, with women as the planners and men as the implementers. In the afternoon, they entertain female guests, hosting banquets with various names. Men are considered very fortunate to be invited.</p>
<p>In New York, after the noon whistle blows on Saturday, the citizens scatter like birds and beasts, quickly discussing plans for leisure on Sunday. As a result, the city streets are as quiet as a cemetery. The suburbs, usually as silent as the seabed, immediately become a luxurious and lively scene. The air on Sunday is the only delicious drink for Americans, providing them with intoxication.</p>
<h3>Yue Wu Mu and the "Ox"</h3>
<p>— Zongheng</p>
<p>What is the relationship between Yue Wu Mu and the ox? I say there is one. Look at the following. We have read the *Romance of Yue Fei* (this book was on the list of banned books during the Qing Dynasty) and probably all know there was a foolish general named Niu Gao. In the *Romance of Yue Fei*, he is said to be Yue Wu Mu's sworn brother, but in the official history, he is said to be Yue Wu Mu's subordinate general. He was from Lu Shan (belonging to Henan), his courtesy name was Boyuan. He repeatedly defeated the Jin people and was instrumental in capturing Yang Yao. He was promoted to Ningguo Army Commissioner. He was also a national hero. Yue Wu Mu got a lot of help from him. The traitor Qin Hui having killed Yue Wu Mu, he was naturally worried that Niu Gao and the others would rise up in revenge. Therefore, to wipe them out in one fell swoop, he secretly ordered the commander Tian Shizhong to poison Niu Gao. The story is like this: One day after Yue Wu Mu died, Tian Shizhong suddenly held a large banquet for the generals. The honest and frank General Niu naturally did not suspect anything. But when the wine had been flowing for some time, General Niu was poisoned to death. You see how vicious the traitors' methods were! The *Romance of Yue Fei* says that Jin Wuzhu was angered to death and Old Niu Gao laughed to death; these are words to soothe the readers' emotions and are unreliable. It is said that General Niu was also buried in West Lake, Hangzhou, after his death, but I personally went to Hangzhou several times and never found the tomb of this loyal national hero. I always feel regretful in my heart. (Editor's note: Niu's tomb is below Purple Xia Cave)</p>
<p>Also, there is a tragic scene in the *Romance of Yue Fei* where Gao Chong challenges the Hua chariot. The location of this tragedy was Niu Tou Mountain. The mountain is located south of Jiangning County, Jiangsu. The *Book of Song: Ritual Records* states: "In the third year of the Daming era, the southern suburban altar was moved to Niu Tou Mountain in Moling." *Yuanhe Zhi* states: "The mountain is forty miles south of the county. The mountain has two peaks, facing each other east and west, named Shenque, formerly known as Daque." It can be seen that this mountain was a strategically important place in military terms. History only says that Yue Wu Mu ambushed and defeated Jin Wuzhu here. The scene of challenging the Hua chariot in the *Romance of Yue Fei* was perhaps a sacrifice of this battle, but finally Jin Wuzhu was defeated, which shows that this tragedy had a considerable cost. It is said that there is an iron mine on this mountain, with the ore bed exposed on the top of the mountain and its northwest slopes. The ore on the slopes is of better quality, while the ore on the top of the mountain is of slightly inferior quality. The total ore reserves of the entire mountain are only tens of thousands of tons. It originally belonged to the Continental Company, but after a large exploration, the results were poor, and operations were stopped (see *Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Place Names*). It is also a pity that the buried resources are submerged.</p>
<p>The above two things are what I said is the relationship between Yue Wu Mu and the ox, because this year is the Year of the Ox, and the country is in a time of broken mountains and rivers. The story of this national hero is most worthy of our praise, so I have written it out in a scattered way as above, for the general public to use as a "not meaningless" topic of conversation during tea and after dinner.</p>

<p>*Shen Bao* Local Supplement</p>
<h3>Blackie</h3>
<p>— Xinye</p>
<p>A narrow-gauge railway stretched sinuously from Huangye Ridge to the banks of the Du Ma River, quietly like two dead snakes. The small coal car was busy, crawling on it all day long, from the mining area to the depot, a short five or six miles, it was able to travel back and forth every fifteen minutes, carrying load after load of coal into the depot, while at the same time bringing the empty baskets back to the mining area.</p>
<p>After a sharp whistle sounded, a group of "blackies" crowded out of the mine. Their ink-black oilcloth hats and clothes were covered with patches of water stains. The black marks on their faces could not hide the fatigue of their lives. Although they were all in their prime, one could not find a trace of the courage that young adults should have in them.</p>
<p>Mu Long was awakened by the second long whistle. He pushed aside the ragged cotton batting that was pressing on him, got out of bed, hurriedly put on the stiff and cold oilcloth hat and clothes, and ran out of the mine house. A yawn rose from his throat, as if telling him that he had not had enough sleep.</p>
<p>Everyone in the mine house had run out. Those who had finished their shift had not yet returned. Only a few sick "blackies" were lying on their bunks, groaning heavily.</p>
<p>"Damn, living ten hours for forty or fifty cents, dying in a thin board coffin. Being a 'blackie' is really not something a human should do!" Mu Long muttered as he carried a carbide lamp that had not yet been lit and walked towards the mine entrance.</p>
<p>The sound of the winding machine was rattling. The mine entrance was already crowded with people. The small carbide lights flickered in the cold wind. The "blackies" who had finished their shift were lifted up by the winding machine like drowned chickens, group by group, and once they were on the surface, they all scattered. Mu Long ran over and lit the carbide lamp for a companion named A Li.</p>
<p>The wind was blowing even harder. The pillars of the engineering office were creaking a bit from the shaking. In the gray sky, goose-feather-like white flakes were flying. They drifted into the mine corridor and landed on the "blackies'" bodies and faces, and soon, they turned into a drop of water on their faces and bodies.</p>
<p>The fat foreman stepped out of the office, which was scorched by the stove fire like late spring. He tightened his beaver collar coat. A gust of cold wind blew in his face, almost suppressing a breath that he was about to let out.</p>
<p>"It's really cold, it's snowing!" He muttered to himself as he walked into the engineering office, telling the shift supervisor something, perhaps directing the work below.</p>
<p>The bell on top of the winding machine rang, and then every supervisor ran to the mine entrance. Each of them led eight "blackies" and sent them into a deep, unfathomable black pit on the winding machine.</p>
<p>Steam was rising from the black pit. Mu Long followed the supervisor and squeezed into the winding machine; the winding machine slowly sank into the black pit, like dropping into a chimney. The firelight trembled dimly, and all sounds were isolated. Occasionally, he or his companions would breathe out or cough, and it would sound like thunder. Water droplets dripped from the mud walls, like eaves leaking from a roof tile, all dripping on them.</p>
<p>The winding machine stopped below the stratum. The light of the electric fire in the mine tunnel was as yellow as the eyes of a patient with a degenerative disease. The trolley on the small railway was quietly parked there. The air was still, and a vapor of earth filled the entire tunnel. Hundreds of "blackies" arrived one after another.</p>
<h3>Magnificent Mansion</h3>
<p>— Wang Tian</p>
<p>At the corner of Fourth Malu and Henan Road in Shanghai, there stands a magnificent mansion. The inside of the mansion is furnished very beautifully. When people walk inside on cold days, they feel very warm and forget the cold. There, you can buy all kinds of good medicines for household use, all kinds of cosmetic fragrances, all kinds of medical devices, and all kinds of lotus root and fruit foods, and you can also fill all kinds of prescriptions. There are also soft sofas inside where customers can sit at ease. The shop assistants there are all "service trained" and are very kind to customers. No matter how much you buy, they are equally diligent in their service. As for the prices of the goods, they are not increased because of the well-equipped facilities, but are actually cheaper than other stores. No wonder the people of Shanghai like to patronize this magnificent mansion. (Note: this mansion is the Wuzhou Pharmacy.)</p>
<h3>Tooth Whiteness Competition</h3>
<p>— Ruyu</p>
<p>A dozen children gathered in the schoolyard. The teacher walked over and asked, "Who among you is the most hygienic?" These children all vied to say that they were the most hygienic. The teacher said, "I have a way, which is to see whose teeth are the whitest. Whoever has the whitest teeth is the most hygienic." So the teacher checked everyone's teeth in order. Some had black teeth, some had yellow teeth. As a result, only Wang Er's teeth were the cleanest and whitest. The teacher then announced that Wang Er was the most hygienic and praised him greatly. Wang Er said, "I know that teeth are very important, so I brush them carefully every day, and I use '131 Toothpaste' from Wuzhou Pharmacy, which is especially effective in cleaning and protecting teeth."</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Everyone went to work separately, with small workers, large workers, blacksmiths, and carpenters all supervised by the supervisors of each section. Mu Long's team consisted of eight people, led by a supervisor named Zhao, and they walked towards a deep, dark mine tunnel.</p>
<p>The firelight of the carbide lamps shone in the mine tunnel. The sounds of chiseling stone and splitting coal rang out as one. Sometimes, laughter or complaints would be heard intermittently among the companions, but all these sounds were like being in a jar, only ringing in each other's ears.</p>
<p>"Old Li, Xiao Ling is pretty good, I think she's a little interested in you. Haha!" A Wang said seriously to a thin young man.</p>
<p>"Don't say that, be careful of the supervisor's whip!" Old Li made a face and answered, but he was thinking about the girl who washed clothes by the stream next to the mine house every day. She hadn't come to the stream for two days, and he didn't know why. He really missed her a little.</p>
<p>The laughter stopped under the supervisor's scolding, but the sound of metal instruments hitting the coal seam and slate became even louder. A Li felt dizzy and nauseous several times, but he finally endured it. He wanted to slack off, but the supervisor's sharp eyes seemed to be fixed on him all the time.</p>
<p>Time seemed to crawl very slowly in the "blackies'" hearts, and everyone's stomachs had long been rumbling with echoes, but the whistle for shift change was still not heard.</p>
<h3>Face</h3>
<p>— Lu Jia</p>
<p>To depict one's own face is like the hesitant brushstrokes of an immature painter on a desolate autumn wilderness.</p>
<p>Only because of years of wandering do I not only have a rough soul, but also have the years eroded the youth on my face. In the morning, I occasionally linger in front of the mirror for a moment, and what an aging face is reflected in the mirror!</p>
<p>Due to a wandering life, the fullness and rosiness of my forehead have disappeared, and it is covered with countless deep, vertical and horizontal wrinkles. Each wrinkle is engraved with a pile of hardships and sorrows. This is because I have a heart that cannot be stretched, so I also have eyebrows that cannot be stretched, accumulating into lines of forehead wrinkles, like a muddy road after snowmelt, covered with countless complex whip marks.</p>
<p>Along this narrow road, withered grass grows like a clump of dry hair, dry and messy, and some are even gray. It used to be as dark and shiny as my pupils, covering my forehead neatly, but now it hasn't been trimmed for years, and I don't have the mood to trim it either.</p>
<p>Speaking of my pupils, I can still remember the past brilliance of judging people, the crystal tears, and the silent and lingering ripples in my eyes; but now, a stone covered with moss is placed in stagnant, dark green water, without a breeze to stir up a ripple, looking empty at the chaotic sky above and the vast twilight fields around. When the snow melts in spring, the water will overflow and become a winding stream, flowing into the vast wilderness.</p>
<p>The desolate nose is like an isolated ancient tomb. The weeds in front of the tomb are already deep, but who will come to sweep the tomb and repair the tomb site?</p>
<p>Standing on the ridge of the tomb, one can see the barren fields with steep slopes! These are my cheeks. The fields after harvest are empty and lonely, leaving some stubble and withered grass, covered with a layer of frost and snow. When will they receive the caress of the spring breeze?</p>
<p>The drawing should be considered complete here, no, I forgot my lips. This is an ancient stone cave at the end of the wasteland. Speaking of which, there is still a mysterious but beautiful legend that has been passed down from the primitive times along with the stone cave. It is said that the stone cave used to produce crystal clear red jade, and many girls risked coming here to collect it as an ornament on their chests. It is said that a red dragon also lived in the cave, often spewing red flames, so many girls died as martyrs. This story may be true, but now there is no red stone at the entrance of the cave, only gray-colored rocks; there are no more flames spewed by the red dragon, only empty cold winds, sighs, and sobs.</p>
<p>Putting down my pen and looking at my face in the mirror again, what an aging face I have, out of proportion to my age.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Water Price Increase</h3>
<p>— Tian Yu</p>
<p>The British-owned Public Concession Water Company has submitted a request to the Public Works Department for approval to increase water prices, which is scheduled to take effect on February 1, changing to an 80% charge. Organizations such as the First Special District Citizens' Federation have risen up in opposition, requesting that the Public Works Department, in view of the declining market and the difficulties faced by citizens, immediately cancel the approval of the water price increase. Previously, when telephone prices were increased, all citizens fiercely opposed it, and the issue was extremely serious, but in the end, the telephone company won, and the price increase was implemented in full according to the original plan. They even said proudly: "After the price increase, the number of telephones has greatly increased, which shows that this price increase method is actually welcomed by citizens." Looking at these words, we feel a sense of increased burden every time we make a phone call, which is truly a feeling of being both crying and laughing. This time, a similar issue of water price increase is just beginning. Will the result follow the same path as the telephone price increase issue? This depends on the method and determination of the citizens' struggle this time.</p>
<p>In terms of method, my personal opinion is that it is useless to simply oppose in words. It is imperative that a special project thoroughly studies the operating conditions of the water company, providing evidence to prove that the water price increase is currently an act against social interests. For example, how much is the official interest paid by the company, how much is the dividend, whether the company's expenses exceed the necessary level, and are far beyond the general living standards of Shanghai citizens. We know that the telephone company hires several telephone experts to organize a telephone research institute, spending tens of thousands of yuan at once, not hesitating to do so, and the telephone price increase is a must. Collecting three or five cents of telephone fees from the citizens to supply the company's squandering is fundamentally a contradiction. The water company of course also has the same situation. In the current economic downturn, general interest rates are declining, but several large enterprises held in the hands of foreign businessmen that are closely related to the vital interests of all citizens—electricity, telephone, water, trams, and even bus companies—still stubbornly maintain their high interest rates above general interest rates, ignoring the decline of society and only maintaining the unique and generous interests of a small number of people. This is truly the most unreasonable thing. To oppose the water price increase, we must concentrate all our efforts and attack this unreasonable weakness. But this must first have a thorough study to be possible, and cannot be done with carelessness or neglect.</p>
<p>But then again, the operating conditions of several monopolistic enterprises in Shanghai held in the hands of foreign businessmen are incompatible with the current society—these types of monopolistic enterprises should be run by the state for the welfare of the citizens—this is already a well-known fact. Therefore, the citizens cannot exercise their supervisory rights over these social enterprises only because the enterprises are in the hands of foreigners, and there is a strong political force behind them. Therefore, even though we listed the unreasonable reasons for the telephone price increase as the basis for opposition, we were certainly righteous, but we ultimately failed under the strong support of the concession authorities. Therefore, whether we can win the final victory in opposing the water price increase this time, the most important key is whether all citizens have the determination to persevere to the end!</p>

<h3>Cecil B. DeMille's "The Plainsman" is About to be Released</h3>
<p>Since "The Crusades" was released in Shanghai, we have not seen a new work by Cecil B. DeMille for more than a year. Now, "The Plainsman," directed by him, is said to be released in the Grand Theater starting from the Lunar New Year's Eve. The story of the film takes place in the American West after the American Civil War. At that time, indigenous people lived there together, and bandits were rampant. It was still a chaotic era, so a hero nicknamed "Wild Bill" was born. This name is known to three-year-old children in the United States. In the chaotic world, he disregarded his life and made a world-shattering career. Such a role is played by Gary Cooper, of course, he can do his duty, and Jean Arthur's co-starring is even more perfect. As for the great background and the majestic spirit, it is a special feature of DeMille's works, and of course, it is also the case in this film.</p>
<h3>Dianbanhua Shoots Three Films at the Same Time</h3>
<p>Dianbanhua started her film life as early as three or four years ago. Because there was no proper opportunity, all her talents were not exposed, but the impression she gave people was very deep. As long as you mention her name, no one will not know it.</p>
<p>This time she joined Xinhua, she feels very excited, and she asked the company to give her plenty of opportunities to perform. Xinhua's owner Zhang Shankun originally planned to give her the role of a villain, but now seeing that she has such an ambition to make progress, he feels that she is a talent worth promoting, so he decisively assigned her to play the role of the village girl, the heroine of "Night Rain on the Xiaoxiang River."</p>
<p>"Night Rain on the Xiaoxiang River" is a social drama directed by Zhang Shankun and Wang Cilong, which has been in production for two or three weeks, and the work is becoming increasingly tense, but Dianbanhua is working calmly. At the same time, she also has roles in Wu Yonggang's "Blood in the Cloud Sea" and Shi Dongshan's "March of the Youth," and they will start soon. Dianbanhua's becoming a popular star is probably at this time.</p>
<h3>"Winter in a Poor Alley" Released</h3>
<p>"Winter in a Poor Alley" depicts a group of children of the city who live under the heavy burden of sorrow and struggle under the giant palm of fate. In the iron cage and the capitalist trap, they use a cavity of passionate blood and a bright red heart to resist the harsh winter in this poor alley. The play is originally written by the great writer Anderson and won the drama championship last year. When it was performed on the stage, it was a sell-out for two seasons. Now, under the banner of RKO Pictures, it is brought to the screen for the first time, and it is still starred by the original cast on the stage. New star Paige McReady and beautiful and mysterious actress Maige have wonderful and amazing performances in this film. The film will be released in the Nanjing Grand Theater today.</p>
<h3>Performing "Elegy of Lovebirds" Starting Today</h3>
<p>Lu Xixi and Lu Qiqi's Drama Broadcasting Troupe has more than a dozen members, including Wu Meimei, Yang Yanqiu, and Lu Xiaotong. The performances are profound, and the dialogues are fluent. The various programs broadcast are very popular among the audience. The play "Elegy of Lovebirds" is especially praised by people from all walks of life because of its tortuous and fragrant plot, and its sad and moving story. Recently, in response to the earnest requests of the audience, the troupe has decided to perform the play on stage, and will perform it day and night for four consecutive days at the Great China Theater at the entrance of the Racecourse on Fourth Road starting today.

<h3>The Increasingly Refined 1937 New Austin</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Anyone who has visited the 1937 New Austin car currently displayed at the Mayer &amp; Co. Auto Company showroom on Mayer Road will undoubtedly feel that the beauty of the new car's lines has reached its peak. This is indeed one of its most prominent advantages. The reason why the new car has such wonderful lines should be attributed to the proper proportion of its entirety. The design and construction of the New Austin are based on sound basic principles, so the proper proportion is natural, not accidental. As for the praise, it is because the new car can thoroughly solve all the practical needs related to comfort. The New Austin is not only more spacious inside, making passengers feel more comfortable, but also the seats and driving positions are wider than before. As for the stability on the road and the clarity of vision, they are all far superior to before. In addition, the noise of the new car's engine and the vibration of the machine power have been eliminated, so its quietness is even more unmatched.</p>
<p>Driving a car, if you want to be relaxed and happy, and feel happy in spirit, then quietness is one of the most important conditions. This is generally recognized by car enthusiasts. In addition to adopting original power insulation, the New Austin's streamlined body arc curve transforms the whistling wind sound into an indistinguishable light hiss when driving at high speed. As for the all-steel body panels, they are also insulated. This is why it is particularly quiet, and those who are in it feel very comfortable.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of safety, another important progress of the New Austin is that the entire body, whether it is the door side panel, the floor panel, or the roof, is made of all steel, so its strength and durability are unmatched. The new car's windows and windshields are still equipped with three-layer thick glass. As for the green-style car stopper and the flexible and foolproof steering wheel, they make the new car extremely safe and reliable at any speed.</p>
<p>The various characteristics of the New Austin car have been tested in a very strict manner in the famous dangerous mountain passes of the Alps, so its perfection has been clearly proven, and Austin's absolute reliability has also been completely trusted by people in the automotive industry.</p>
<h3>"Diesel" Powered Car</h3>
<p>The picture shows the situation of the smallest six-cylinder "Diesel" engine made in the United States installed in an ordinary passenger car.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of the car powered by this engine is fuel economy. According to the test, the engine in the picture traveled 280 miles, and the fuel cost was 54 cents US dollars, which is only one-tenth of the cost of gasoline traveling the same mileage.</p>
<p>The installer of this engine is the famous "Diesel" engineer Hanfield. This machine can generate 79 horsepower and rotate 2,600 times per minute. Its cubic displacement is 260 inches, which is slightly higher than the standard six-cylinder gasoline engine.</p>
<p>Using ordinary "Diesel" fuel, it can travel an average of 30 miles per gallon.</p>
<h3>Automatically Capturing Photos of Car Accident Scenes</h3>
<p>— Y</p>
<p>An American named Lunin has invented a camera that captures street car accident scenes. This machine can be installed on street corners, safety zones, and places with traffic lights. If a car ignores the traffic light signal and drives straight across the road, then the number on its rear license plate will never escape this camera.</p>
<p>In the picture, ① is the camera installed on the sidewalk. ② is the signal light in the safety zone in the middle of the road. If a car ignores the signal and drives over it, then the machine sheet will be pressed down, triggering the camera's button and automatically taking pictures. ③ is the developed photo, which records the actual situation at that time, along with the date and time, in detail. If you want to go to court, this photo is a very powerful witness.</p>
<p>Lunin, the inventor of this machine, was knocked to the ground by a car in the middle of the road, but the car ran away. So he painstakingly invented this machine. From then on, car accidents can completely record the situation at that time and the car number.</p>
<h3>The Whole Story of the General Motors Strike</h3>
<p>Z&gt;Yingdai</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1936, the American automotive industry encountered an unfortunate event. A major strike occurred at General Motors. Until now, a solution has not been obtained. Here, the whole story of the General Motors strike is briefly reported to readers as follows.</p>
<p>① The Occurrence of the Strike After Roosevelt was elected President of the United States, he advocated the revival of the industrial movement in order to remedy the various problems caused by the economic crisis. In the past four years, although it seems that various industries have begun to enter the path of revival on the surface, the contradictions between capitalists and the labor sector have not decreased as a result. Therefore, although Luo was able to continue to be elected this time, the strikes in various industries in the United States were still very serious. Even in the automotive industry, at the end of 1936, strikes were already brewing. The reason why they did not occur was nothing more than the authorities' strict precautions to eliminate the strikes. However, at the beginning of 1937, strikes in the automotive industry still occurred.</p>
<p>② The Number of Strikers On December 31, 1936, there was already news in the United States that auto workers would go on a large-scale strike in the New Year. Therefore, on New Year's Day in 1937, workers from six factories specializing in manufacturing Fisher bodies for General Motors, four Chevrolet branches, and several other factories in Detroit, the auto city of the United States, began to strike. General Motors is one of the three major car manufacturers in the United States. The entire factory employs 211,000 auto workers. At first, only 40,000 people joined the strike, but because the strike could not be resolved for a while, it quickly expanded. By the 4th, there were more than 70 large and small factories belonging to General Motors that were on strike. The number of strikers even exceeded 100,000.</p>
<p>③ The Conditions Proposed After the strike occurred, all the workers who participated in the strike occupied the factories, so that all work could not be carried out at all. At the same time, they put forward conditions to the capitalists. The three main conditions were ① increase wages, ② improve treatment, and ③ recognize collective consultation. However, because a satisfactory reply was not received from the factory for a while, it became a situation of being unable to dismount. Both sides insisted on continuing.</p>
<p>④ The Authorities' Attention The local officials attached great importance to this strike at General Motors. Therefore, after the strike occurred, the Michigan authorities immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to be stationed around all the striking car factories to prevent the occurrence of riots. On the other hand, notices were posted, ordering the workers occupying the car factories to leave the factories as soon as possible, and to make efforts to prevent the strike from expanding. However, the workers ignored it, making the authorities unable to do anything. In addition to the Michigan authorities, US President Roosevelt also paid close attention to this matter, fearing that all the auto workers in the United States would join the strike line, which would be even more difficult to solve.</p>
<p>⑤ The Company's Losses As mentioned above, General Motors is a large car manufacturer in the United States, so the average daily output of cars is also not small. However, since the strike occurred, all the larger branches have been completely in a state of strike. All work cannot be carried out. Only a small part of the factories did not join the strike group and are working as usual, but the cars produced are also very few, less than half of the usual output. Moreover, judging from the current situation, the complete solution of the strike will take at least a month. It can be seen that the losses suffered by General Motors this time due to the strike are not small.</p>
<p>⑥ Start Negotiations After the strike occurred, the workers demanded immediate negotiations, but General Motors believed that the occupation of factories by the strikers was illegal and this trend could not be allowed to grow, so it insisted that no negotiations would be held before the workers left the factories. Therefore, both sides held their own opinions, and the matter became more and more僵 (deadlocked). Until recently, after the mediation of various parties, the workers agreed to first withdraw all the workers occupying the factories, and then the labor and management would start negotiations again. When the author collected the data and drafted this article, the General Motors strike had been going on for more than two weeks. The negotiation meeting is scheduled to start this Monday. Judging from the general situation, the time required for the negotiation will take at least two weeks. Therefore, this General Motors strike cannot be ended in less than a month. The magnitude of the loss can also be imagined.</p>
<h3>Automotive News</h3>
<p>African Car Race Recently, the Royal East African Automobile Association organized a car race from Nairobi to Johannesburg. The total distance is 2,715 miles. Forty-two cars participated, and the bonuses ranged from £200 to £1,000. The drivers had many thrilling experiences. The most unfortunate was the driver of car No. 11, Mr. Weiscobo. He was driving a Ford V8 and was leading the way, far exceeding other cars. When he was only a hundred miles away from the finish line, there was a sudden bang, and the car had an accident. A cow suddenly appeared and became the god of misfortune, causing the driver to lose the championship that he was sure of winning. As a result of the collision, the car's water tank was damaged considerably. He immediately tried to replace it with a new water tank and continued to move forward, but valuable time had been lost, and the championship went to others. Even so, Mr. Weiscobo still won the runner-up.</p>
<p>Long-Distance Driving of More Than 40,000 Miles If a car enthusiast can drive 30,000 miles in a year, they will often pride themselves on having reached a high record. However, they do not know that the drivers of freight trucks have a total mileage that exceeds this number by far. Recently, Mr. Naiba of Golden Eagle Road in Subad Bush drove a freight truck and traveled a total of 45,000 miles in a year. This car is a Ford CNT freight truck. According to Mr. Naiba himself, except for changing a new tire once, his only repair cost was one shilling and six pence. Mr. Naiba also said that this mileage is a record in his 21 years of driving.</p>
<p>Ford Crossing the Sahara Desert Recently, an Englishman named Harold Wuton and his wife drove a 10-horsepower British-made Ford special sedan from Guinea Bay to Algeria, a total distance of 3,000 miles. Mr. Wuton is the manager of the Nigeria rubber plantation of the African United Company. He obtained permission to cross the Sahara Desert by car during his vacation back to England. The couple traveled a large part of the journey completely unattended. The route they took was also the more difficult of the two car routes, starting from Kano (in northern Nigeria), winding north through the rocky desert, which is 2,000 miles long. On the way, they also had to cross the mountains and wilderness of Air and Hoggar. This route was only passable by cars at the end of 1933. There are 1,600 miles that can be said to have no route at all. The places they passed were rocky and separated by fine sand, with stone piles as landmarks. The necessary supplies along the way, such as tents and containers for gasoline and water, were all loaded in the car. On one occasion, the car carried enough water, food, and food for a 500-mile wilderness journey. The load was equal to the weight of seven adults. This road is very dangerous, and anyone driving alone considers it a daunting task. Along the way, it is necessary to report to each station by radio. Although the roads traveled by Mr. Wuton were all discouraging, and the items he carried were so heavy, the journey was relatively uneventful. The car never stopped, and there were no mechanical difficulties. There was only one tire puncture.</p>
