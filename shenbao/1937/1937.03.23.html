<p>▲迎頭趕上　中國今日若要救亡圖存、惟有努力於增進民力、以增進國力、這是無可疑的、固然、我們當積累的時候、並沒忘記了犧牲、需要犧牲之時、我們必然將所有積累用於犧牲、以蔪犧牲影響之廣大、然在積累之時間、則我們惟有盡其全力、以期積累之增進、有些人說、今日積累已來不及了因為我們產業經濟樣樣落後、即使如何積累、也不能與先進的國家競爭、那麼即使積累也無補於危亡、這些說話、我們實在不能說是沒有理由、但是這種悲觀是徒然的、我們若要救亡圖存、必須拋棄了“來不及了”的思想、而本着總理“迎頭趕上”之精神、猛力從事、所謂“迎頭趕上”含義之深、固不是兄弟所能妄加揣測、但是就顯而淺者着想、我們若是循着人家走過的路線、那麼自然無論如何也趕不上、例如經濟建設若是循着資本主義之路以前進、或是循着共產主義之路以前進、或是循着法西斯主義之路以前進、那麼無論如何、總會落在後頭、反之、現在世界無論那一種主義、經過一番試驗之後、無不發見了缺點、而加以修正、蘇俄若沒有新經濟政策、以及兩次五年計劃、決不會有今日經濟建設之成功、所以有人說、蘇聯今日的現狀、共產主義失敗了、經濟建設却成功了、又如資本主義的國家也正在向修正缺點努力從事、無論那一種經濟制度、都努力於使之成為合理化、社會化、這在英美各國的經濟建設隨時隨地可以見到、而這種趨勢、總理於數十年前已看透了、民生主義、已對於中國之經濟建設指出了條大路了。這條大路、正是今日世界各國之共同趨向、所謂“迎頭趕上”、其意義或即在於此、換句話說、中國今日之經濟建設、如果循着他人已走之路以前進、那就是來不及了、如果綜合各種學說、以及各國之實際經驗、捨短取長、確定方針、以向前進、那繼是“迎頭趕上”了、不過、我們必須注意、若要做到“迎頭趕上”則經濟建設、不可零零碎碎、而要有整個的計劃、不可枝枝節節、而要從大處着想、這樣方纔做得到“迎頭趕上”、不然、我們只管“迎頭”只管不能“趕上”即使國家閒暇、也是白費了光陰、何況現在國家危急存亡至於如此、真個的時不我待呢、</p>
<p>▲根絕赤禍　還有幾句話、兄弟在晋綏時、同志對於中國根絕赤禍的政策、極為注意、多所垂詢、兄弟答復的話、會在報上發表了一些了、共產黨人如果不接受三中全會的決議、那麼只有趨於消滅、如其接受、則自救之路、並沒斷絕、不過所謂接受是要誠意的接受、例如階級鬥爭之說、足以拆散整個民族的團結、是絕對不能容許的、然而若表面的放棄了階級鬥爭的宣傳、而實際則混入民眾裏頭、以行其分化的作用、而促成整個民族的團結之崩潰、那不是誠意接受三中全會的決議、而是改變策略從中取事、其毒辣較之明明白白為階級鬬爭之宣傳、還要可惡、我們鑒於以前的種種痛苦經驗、不能不喚起民眾的注意、用十分嚴正的態度來監視着、始能加以防止、而根本的積極的防止方法、仍為經濟建設之進行、因為經濟建設如果進行、則人民痛苦得以解除、生產增進、分配合理、消費之力亦以加强、人民眼前擺着一條生路、可以掉臂遊行、自然沒有鋌而走險之患、則野心之徒、雖欲倡亂、亦苦於無所憑藉了、以上所說、可以證明安內攘外是一件事、不是兩件事、即專就攘外而論、平時積累與最後犧牲、也是一件事、不是兩件事、我們同志處這國家存亡危急之時、惟有認定了這個方向、竭其心力、以向前進、繼之以死、再無他說、這就是此次兄弟在晉綏和同志交換意見的大概、完了、（廿二日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>菲律賓要求提早獨立問題</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>菲律賓共和國總統奎松此次前往美國。除與華盛頓當局商討商務問題外。並提出菲島提早獨立的問題。原來菲律賓共和國。依據台定斯麥克杜斐法案的規定。須至一九四五年以後始能完全獨立。在一九四五年以前。菲島表面上雖脫離了美國的統治而成為一個共和國。但實際上除了一些不重要的內政外。其餘如國債幣制外交關係移民問題憲法修改以及國防等權。都仍由美國繼續行使。這樣形式的獨立。當然是酷愛自由的菲律賓人民所不能容受的。因此在獨立法實行一年後。奎松總統就在這次談話中提出提早獨立時期的問題。從一九四五年改為一九三八年及一九三九年。據外電所傳。美政府已允予考慮。並擬組織專家委員會。研究修改菲律賓獨立法。惟正式行動則須待專家委員會向國會提出報告以後。因此在最近期內。這提早獨立的問題是不會有若何決定的。</p>
<p>美國將來對這問題的如何決定。當然要看專家委員會的研究結果以及國會的態度如何。我們現在不便作若何肯定的推測。不過美國一般輿論界對此事的見解。却可以拿來做我們考察這問題的參考。美人對於菲律賓獨立問題一向分為兩派。一派主張不放松。一派贊成獨立。這兩派意見的分歧也可表現出美國遠東政策的動盪情形。主張獨立的人。大多是贊成美國退出遠東舞台的人們。他們以為美國在遠東的經濟利益並不大。（尤其是指中國）何必糜費這樣巨大的經費去維持海陸軍的力量。並以為戰爭如一旦爆發。菲律賓也極易被日本佔領。因此他們主張退出中國。放棄菲島。而以夏威夷為國防的第一線。但是另一派人則從經濟的政治的與軍事的觀點上反對美國退出中國。放棄菲律賓。他們甚至以為政治軍事的利益超過一切經濟的利益。因為在政治的優勢之下。經濟的勢力才能有順利發展的可能。這派的勢力當然比較前一派為大。例如最近赫爾國務鄉就表示過美國對於遠東問題的密切注意。赫爾說。“全年中遠東局勢。迄未安定。中國境內美僑保護問題。常使國務部密切關心。有時且引起嚴重之憂盧。蓋美僑之生命財產及美國政府對於遠東各國之和平與福利。均為美國所關切。致使我人對該方面局面之任何發展。莫不深加注意。”（見十九日國民社電）</p>
<p>照上面這樣說來。反對美國退出遠東舞臺一派的勢力既然很大。那末美國理應不允許菲律賓成立共和國並於十年後完全獨立了。但事實上華盛頓當局却為什麼早已實行獨立法。現在並允許組織專家委員會考盧提早獨立的問題呢。其實這是又有原因的。因為在未來的國際關係中。民族情感的融合是非常重要的。如果美國堅決反對菲律賓的獨立。則必引起菲人極大的反感。因此在將來的戰爭中。菲島人民非但不會幫助美國作戰。而反有投入美國敵人懷中的可能。反之。美國如果允許菲律賓以某種限度的獨立。那末它就可博得菲島人民的好感。而在未來戰爭中為美國大出其力了。試看菲島獨立法實行後。美國即派麥克阿塞將軍組織菲島防軍。這些新訓練的國防軍。在幾年之後。就將成為美國在遠東前線的有力戰士了。這種以退為進的方法。是現代帝國主義者統治殖民地人民之最巧妙的方法。所以美國境內反對退出遠東舞臺的一派勢力雖然很大。但它仍能允許菲律賓有限度的獨立。去年英國的允許埃及獨立。也就是這一種原則的應用。至此次奎松總統所建議之提早獨立要求是否能得圓滿解決。也要看美國是否善為利用這種以退為進的策略為斷了。</p>
<h3>中日處現狀下邦交決難調整</h3>
<p>東報認兒玉等此行無結果　日本謀促進對華文化活動</p>
<p>［南京］東京朝日新聞二十二日登載論說題目為“調整中日國交問題”、其內容謂日本赴華考察團在華一週之所得、可以宮崎日清紡績社長所謂“中日兩方均鳴不平、始終無機會交涉經濟提携問題”之一語盡之、又綜合各方面報告、其已達到之結論三點、㊀在短期間內殊難調整國交、除維持現狀之外、別無他途、㊁日本應始終援助中國完成現代國家、㊂在今日中日對立之情形下、經濟提携絕對不可能、日本除華北以外、無經濟進出餘地、查其原因當考察團在華時中國官民一致主張先行解決政治問題之必要、以致失却最好機會、因此中日間空氣受不必要之壓榨、使日方絕調整國交之希望、主張維持現狀、同時日本對於華北之關心、忽然加强緊張之度、促成其“對華北以外無經濟進出”之意見、並認維持現狀為日本最大限度之讓步、過此限度之讓步、反使事態更為糾紛、至於冀東問題如取消之、則中國民眾將必乘勢向日本權益挑戰、恰如張學良政權往年在東三省施行打倒滿鐵之毒計、日本甚恐此種事件之再發、又冀東特殊貿易應與政權問題分離交涉、日本現已承認華北政治的調整之必要、故中國應以更大之熱心接近日本、而為日本解消其不安、中國今次未能利用此機會、殊為遺憾、云云、（二十二日同盟電）</p>
<p>［南京］日貴族院今日開會、江口定條對於日本對華文化事業、要求除償還之庚子賠欵外、政府更應自國庫中動用特別欵項、俾使日本對華文化事業、得自純粹專門學術之研究、擴展至中國實際情形之研究、並改善設備以吸收中國留日學生、江口復要求組織特別委員會、直接歸政府管轄、以促進對華之文化活動、外務省對華文化事業部長岡田答稱、江口君所表示之意見、將視為有益之參考、希望將來藉新法律之力付諸實施、日本對華文化事業基金、泰半來自償還之庚子賠欵、其本息之總額往昔約為七千萬元、現已清付四千三百萬元、按日本法律之限制、該欵僅以國內公債及存欵之形式、由大藏省存儲、而祇將其利息作為對華文化活動之用、最近議會通過修改該法律、規定將該基金自四月一日起作為購買中國國家公債、投資鐵路鑛業、以及華北其他事業之用、故所謂文化基金業已移作別種用途、其目標已超越文化範圍矣、觀於此種修改與邇來在華北集中日本經濟活動之談以及日本財閥遲遲在華北投資一舉、互有關連、故極為重要云、（中央社二十二日電）</p>

<p>佐藤外相答</p>
<p>雖在交涉不成立時、須應努力避免國交上重大問題之發生、</p>
<p>東武問</p>
<p>最近兩次之漁區拍賣、對於日本殊不利、蘇俄五年計劃現向收回日本權益之方面進行、因此余不能信漁業條約得容易進行、據余意見、此即林首相所謂一觸即發之危機、外相已有對此覺悟乎、</p>
<p>佐藤外相答</p>
<p>余亦未曾考盧漁業條約得順利進行、因此不能不覺悟今後遭遇多數困難、其時當以最善努力處理之、</p>
<p>東武問</p>
<p>有田前外相曾有與蘇俄交涉撤退蘇聯軍隊之事實乎、</p>
<p>堀內外次答</p>
<p>廣田外相時代屢次要求蘇俄反省國境防備之現象、欲以兩國協定、實際規定此問題、應由俄方先表示誠意、然後始可、</p>
<p>東武更質問北樺太石油資源問題、外相對此有所答辯、</p>
<p>八角三郎（政友）對於日艦開入蘇聯海港（比德羅賓羅斯基）之問題提出質問、</p>
<p>佐藤外相答</p>
<p>各種問題混淆、故對蘇問題今後雖須充分努力、但不能言明其關係得以迅速轉好耳、</p>
<p>東氏繼續質問</p>
<p>拒絕批准之條約、能否由其新出發點再行改造、</p>
<p>堀內外次答</p>
<p>假令將來內容相同、亦當成為新訂之條文、</p>
<p>東氏復詢及蘇滿國境確定委員會之經過、並要求說明、　　堀內外次答</p>
<p>處理國境糾紛與防止發生國境糾紛、均分別設有委員會、前者蘇聯方面主張設立處理全部國境之糾紛、日本方面則主張限於東部國境者、蘇聯對此亦表同意、後者雖經蘇聯之同意、而迄今尚有若干未得到解決之件、故希望蘇聯採取誠意之態度、</p>
<p>東氏又問</p>
<p>所餘者究為若何處所、</p>
<p>堀內外次答</p>
<p>一為關於委員會之構成、蘇聯欲以日“滿”為一體、日方則主張以日“滿”蘇三國共同組織之、其他即為關於國境線之件、</p>
<p>其次由小山委員長質問</p>
<p>會期切迫而議案山積、政府有意講求任何方法否、林首相答</p>
<p>余覺有設法必要、</p>

<p>⊙清津　駐海參崴總領事杉下、乘天草丸歸國、行抵清津、關於最近之海參崴略談如左、</p>
<p>曾任駐日蘇聯大使館一等書記官阿斯哥夫氏、此次被任外交人民委駐海參崴外交全權、該氏對於日本極有理解、前次成為問題之商船會、據謂必須使之繼續存在、自當努力云云、此外對於保護日僑、亦當盡力以策萬全、並擬將歷來日蘇間之暗雲掃凈、與我方協助等語、故今後之海參崴當可明朗化者也、至於檢查日輪之進港、最近亦極其和平云云、（二十二日同盟電）</p>

<h3>浪人偷運凶毆關員真相財部派員來滬澈查</h3>
<p>巴氏報告書今可草竣呈報當局　浪人繼續尋豐前夜幾再度衝突　滬海關員十三人昨北赴津緝私</p>
<p>神州社云、日鮮浪人偷運銅元出口、兇毆海關緝私人員事件發生以後、若輩仍準備繼續秘密私運、海關緝私人員、因鑒於事態嚴重、特於日昨發表宣言、財部關務署已派員來滬澈查、現此事前途、正在開展中、茲將各情錄如次</p>
<p>梅雷巴氏詢問真相　神州祉記者昨特走訪海關總稅務司梅樂和氏、叩詢二十日晨、浪人武裝偷運銅元、毆傷關員事件發展情形、據談、海關緝私人員宣言、僅見諸報端、關於上星期六日浪人毆擊關員事、渠仍未接得稅務司巴閏森之正式報告、故暫不願發表任何意見、旋梅氏以電話向巴稅務司查詢一切、據巴氏在電話中云、此項報告、尚未草就、惟事實則不如外傳之嚴重、</p>
<p>財部派員來滬澈查　可靠方面另悉、財政部關務署自得悉此事後、以走私事件、公然在上海猖獗、其性質嚴重、更甚華北、業已派員來滬、將於日內會同梅樂和等澈查、並會商取締辦法、至巴稅務司原定昨日下午往謁梅樂和、作口頭報告、因梅氏先去電話詢問、故即在電話中作簡單報告、現報告書正由巴氏根據在場目擊當時情形之副稽查亞利山大氏報告起草中、今日大致可就緒、即可呈報梅氏、轉呈財部核辦、</p>
<p>浪人尋釁幾再衝突　日鮮浪人偷運銅元、久成公開秘密、與緝私人員、時起衝突、終因浪人人多恃眾、且背後有人為之支持、故二十日之兇毆事件、早具必然條件、而非偶然、上次雖在日領館調解之下、繳出極小部份、但僅許海關以保存名義、暫時保管、日領館及大洋丸、隨時均可取回、兇毆事件發生後、日鮮浪人態度益見强橫、致海關每夜赴匯山碼頭工作人員、隨時均處威脅空氣之下、毫無辦法、聞前夜浪人、曾一度向關員尋釁、關員持容忍態度、始能倖免第二度衝突、然長此以往、如無整個辦法、前途不堪設想、</p>
<p>十三關員昨赴華北　海關外勤入員、自走私又在長江流域猖獗、即將人數、自三百人擴充為三百六七十人、同時在京滬等鐵路各大站、亦設置緝私人員、華北走私猖獗時期、疊由滬海關派去五六十人、玆悉因該項關員、尚不敷分配、昨又由滬派去顧仁民、湯國樑、李克寬、林湯等十三人、顧等即搭當日滬平通車北上云、</p>
<h3>赴歐考察軍事返國　　上官雲相昨日抵滬</h3>

<p>中央社云、奉派赴歐考察各國軍事設備之上官雲相將軍、去歲出國、迄已一載、茲以任務已竣、於上月返國過滬、應粵省綏靖主任余漢謀之邀、轉粵遊覽、昨晨十時卅分由港乘荷輪芝尼加拉號輪抵滬、定三數日內入京、晋謁蔣委員長報告、中央社記者往訪上官氏於其私寓、據談此行考察所得如次、</p>
<p>考察遍及歐洲　本人於去歲奉蔣委員長之命、赴歐考察軍事、以資借鏡、原定考察期為六個月、抵歐後、因時間怱促、不能遍赴各國考察、乃呈請延期六個月、此行赴歐、曾先後赴德•義•英•法•捷克•等國考察、除蘇聯及巴爾幹半島諸小國外、足跡幾遍歐洲各國、凡各國軍事設備以及重工業現狀、莫不詳加考察、考察所得、關於軍事方面、俟謁蔣委員長後、再行發表、</p>
<p>德義愛戴領袖　上官氏繼談此行感想云、本人所經各國、覺在德義兩國考察最感興趣、德國自歐戰失敗後、國內紊亂、經濟衰落、達於極點、後經十六年之奮鬥、現已重振舊威於歐陸、考德國復興、能如此迅速、其最大原因、由於全國上下、能一致擁護領袖、卒賴在希特勒領導之下、得有今日、本人在德時、曾而詢德友、德人是否真誠擁護希特勒、據答、在德國現處環境之下、須有一領袖來領導全國民眾奮鬥、其舉國上下之愛戴領袖、實令人生羨、義國國際地位日漸增高、亦由於全國人士擁護領袖墨索里尼所致、所以我國欲復興民族、亦須追效德義人士擁護領袖之決心、</p>

<h3>本市實施勞働服務後浚河築堤工程完成</h3>
<p>勞働服務會定下月辦結束　徵工服役待市府決定實行</p>
<p>本市市政府於去年十二月十九日、開始冬令勞働服務以來、各區浚河築提工程、將次竣事定四月初旬閉幕、本市徵工服役計劃、待市府決定後、再行實施、茲將各情分誌如次</p>
<p>勞働工程　市府按照軍事委員會訂定冬令勞働服務辦法後、即擬定計劃、劃分十區、臨時就各區內徵抽壯丁六萬餘人、於去年十二月十九日開始勞働服務、茲計已浚竣河流及築堤者、計㊀吳淞區張華浜•盛家浜、㊁殷行區袁長河•鵝艬浦•錢家浜、㊂江灣區斜塘、㊃引翔區楊樹浦•虬江之西段、㊄真茹區木凟港、虬江桃浦、㊅蒲淞區沙河南段、雙陽港、㊆漕涇區上澳塘、㊇高橋區黃潼港南段•青浦港•新港•東塘土塘•㊈高行區護塘浜•鹹塘浜•樁樹浦、橫浜、㊉陸行區朱家溝、四十四圖馬家浜堤、共計二十二處</p>
<p>延長閉幕　冬令勞働服務浚河築堤工程計劃、原定於本年三月底、即行工竣閉幕、昨據該會總幹事洪起語大公社記者云、本市勞働服務、自去年十二月間、各區先後開始動員服務後、因受天氣影響、河浜抽出之水、復因天雨降落、致浚挖工程之時間上延擱、現計各區已竣、工程佔全部十分之七八、其未竣工程、尚在繼續工作、原定本月底閉幕期、因此將展延至下月初旬、方可工竣云、</p>
<p>徵工服役　關於“徵工服役、”自經行政院通令全國後、各省市均已先後奉令實行、且辦有良好成績、惟本市方面尚未舉行又據洪總幹事云、此項服役、係廣義的、性質永久、包括築路建設衛生等等、而勞働服務、甚範圍祇限於農歇時舉行、且係臨時性質、故本市實施徵工服役一事、須待市府決定後、方可進行云、</p>

<h3>陸鼎揆等建議主張自動撤廢領判權</h3>
<p>我國為自保國家安全起見　推有自行限期即宣告撤廢</p>
<p>申時社云、我國於前清咸同年間、與各國開始訂約通商、當時因國人不明外勢、貿然以領事裁判權允許各通商國、致數十年來、</p>
<p>鑄成大錯　貽患無窮、自國民政府成立以後、努力於領事裁判權之撤廢、一面積極於各種法典之完成暨各地法院之設立、一面則由外交當局、分向各友邦進行交涉、如十八年中波通商條約、中希通商條約、中墨通商條約、十九年中捷友好通商條約、並後來之中土通商條約等均已達到取銷目的、然如十七年中比條約中義條約中丹條約、中葡條約、則雖條約正文有兩國人民彼此應受締約國法律及法院之管轄之條文、然各誌國家、均另有附件保留該條之施行、以一九二二年華頓條約各關係國、一律撤廢、為實行之條件、血數年以來、各大國雖經外交當局、一再交涉、仍抱互相觀望之態度、一再推諉、不肯即日放棄、致撤廢遙遙無期、實為我國法權之大障碍、而其影響於國家民族方面、亦極鉅大、本埠律師、</p>
<p>陸鼎揆等　鑒於斯制之撤廢、急不容緩、特建議於上海律師公會、主張陳請政府援引英法比各國停付美國戰債等先例申明不能再行繼續容忍理由、決定日期、自行撤廢、其立論頗值得為國際公法上之探討、茲錄其原提案全文如左、為提議事、竊查領事裁判權制度、上之損害國家主權力、阻碍司法權之統一下使人民對於此種享受特殊權利之外僑、幾無法律可以保障、而於一國之財政•軍事•治安•商業皆受極大之影響、為禍之烈、無與倫比、以視割地、蓋可相當、數十年國家民族之受其毒害、實有罄竹難書之概、國民政府成立伊始本</p>
<p>平等外交　之主旨、嘗與訂約各國、積極交涉、撤廢領事裁判制度、雖若干友邦、業已實行撤廢、而所有號稱第一流强大國家、亦即與中國關係最深諸邦、或則雖願放棄、而惑於其僑民浸潤之愬、或更包藏禍心、且欲利用此制、以破壞國家權力之完整、均互相托詞推諉、不肯實行、雖已有數國訂有附帶條件之撤廢、然一究約文內容、則千篇一律、皆以他國加監撤廢、則該國亦同時撤廢為其允諾之條件、候其自廢之期、何異河清之難俟究彼居心所在、無非欲以相約同撤者、轉以實行其</p>
<p>相約不撤　之本心耳、國家對此連鷄之形勢、苟非出以絕大之努力、必不足以達交涉勝利之目的、而數十年來國家民族所受之毒害且將演進而永遠不絕、夫國家明知是制為害之烈而不敢自起撤廢者、以為有條約之拘束、非雙方之同意、不宜單獨行動耳、顧以會員得之愚以為訂約國單獨自起廢止條約上義務、非特國際公法上、明明有情勢變更可為例外之規定、得以援用、而十年以來、世界列强各國、對於自身應負之條約義務、其性質十百倍重要於此者、往往不問關係國之同意、而決然自起行</p>
<p>宣告廢止　已不知若干次數、舉其最重大者而言、歐戰時代協約各國所負美利堅聯邦之債欵、共約二百萬萬美金而强、戰後各國償付僅及零數、而至一九三○年、英法義比各國陸續向美政府通知、因無力償還、此後停止繳付、雖美政府提出異議、而均掉首不顧矣、巴黎和約訂明德意志應償協約各國賠欵、因德人無法如數繳付、一再磋商而有</p>
<p>楊格計劃　最後而有僅須再付一次之約言、然結果乃連此最後之一期、而德意志亦拒絕償付矣、巴黎和約關於德意志之海陸軍備之限制、萊茵河域之不得屯戌、均有詳細規定、然前年德人公然大張軍備、大構艨艟、逾出於條約之限制、不知若干倍蓰、昨年則德之師旅、高歌而入萊茵河域矣、國際聯盟盟約者、世界上大多數國家共同簽訂之條約、所以互保安全、而維持和平者也、然一九三一年九月十八日、國際聯盟會員國日本帝國、破壤盟約、進兵中國之後、其餘各國、均蔑視盟約之保障條文、並不遵照規定、而予被侵略國家以實力之援助矣前年義大利國又不顧盟約之規定、而吞滅另一會員國之疆土矣、如是之流、數年之中、層見疊出、而彼世界大邦、無不牽涉在內、彼列邦本身、既可對於條約義務、憑其一己之判斷、隨時自行廢除、則吾國對於列强之此項條約義務、以之比擬、巴黎和約、（亦即國際盟約）協約戰債協定、其重要性相去不可以道里計者、當然自得援引列强之先例、根據形勢變更之大原則、而自行單獨宣告廢止之、會員以為應　由政府牒文現有領事裁判權各國、申述中國國家、不得不立即撤廢此項條約之理由、</p>
<p>請其同意　於某月某日以前、完全廢止、如果不獲同意之表示、則逾期之後、中國政府為保其國家之安全起見、惟有自行宣告撤廢、嗣後不論任何國籍、僑民、在中國境內者、不論其為陸地水面、中國政府當積極行使其司法權力祇須以此簡單之方式、而數十年無從解決之交涉、即可收效於指顧、而亦惟有用此效步列强</p>
<p>單刀直入　之手段方可打破列强互相推諉、以難中國之僵局、、然後毒害國家社會之領事裁判權制度、方有廓清之一日、查本會居華洋輻輳之區域、目擊斯制之流毒、最為親切、緣是十年以還、屢有文電條陳政府、請願交涉撤廢、現在國難當前、淪亡堪虞、斯制不除復興難期、會員心所謂危、難安緘默、用敢貢其愚見提請本會執監聯席會議、即日電陳國民政府行政院、請其採擇施行、以保國命、是否有當、敬請公決、提案者、陸鼎揆、連署者江庸、江一平•張志讓•程脩齡•王季銓•李祖虞•劉椿•劉震•顧祖寬•華想生•張舍我•唐世昌•李庚祥•唐士箴•姚啟銘•朱世範、</p>
<h3>幼女奮勇告警三盜悉數成擒</h3>
<p>福煦路戚厚卿家昨午盜刼　捕房對幼女報警表示感慰</p>
<p>昨午十二時許、法租界福煦路第四百六十一弄隣聖坊第三號門牌發生盜刦盜共三人、携木製之假手槍兩支、先在二層樓刦得國幣及金銀飾物等、共約一百餘元、待正欲上三樓搜刦時、為該事主一十五歲女孩乘隙逃出報捕、捕房立派大批中西探捕、馳往圍捕、三盜當場悉數就擒、無一漏網、詳情探錄于後、</p>
<p>伶人之居　法租界福煦路第四六一號弄第三號門牌、係一單幢三層樓石庫門之住房、為向業伶界京劇班頭清江人戚厚鄉（年三十七歲）所租賃、已歷五載、房租每月六十元、戚因家內人口眾多、故未分租於人、厚卿本人現方帶領全班藝員在雲南各地出演、聞已演畢、刻正在返滬途中、</p>
<p>忽來三盜　昨午十二三十分戚之家人午膳方畢、正在分頭整理雜物之際、突由後門闖入口音江北音兩着藍布衫袴、一御西裝大衣之盜匪三人、兩盜執有手槍、一盜首用槍口對住戚妻鄧氏（年三十七歲）之胸際、禁止聲張、繼將屋內男女大小八人一齊驅禁於一樓房內、遂開始搜刦、</p>
<p>迫交鑰匙　三盜先在一樓搜刦一遍、計被刦去國幣七十一元、金戒一只、及銀粉盒綢手帕等物、共約值一百餘元當時眾盜見餘無長物、遂迫令鄧氏交出三樓房門及箱籠鑰匙、氏稍加拒絕、竟遭一匪掌頰數下、蓋氏鑒於三樓存放衣飾甚夥、若盜等一臨三樓勢必損失更重、</p>
<p>幼女報捕　鄧氏正與盜等相持之際、時氏之十五歲之幼女小毛、竟乘乃母與盜等分神之隙、一人潛自下樓奔出後門、適與收取房租之賬房相值、遂會同奔至同孚路口報告該處管理紅綠燈之崗捕、該捕立用電話報告盧家灣法總巡捕房、</p>
<p>三盜成擒　捕頭立即通知特別間撥派預備隊員及大批中西探捕、共乘三大警備車馳往、比抵目的地、先將前後門包圍、然後一擁而入、三盜並未抵抗、悉數就擒並在一盜手中及樓下馬桶間內抄獲木質假手槍兩支、暨全部賊物、一併帶入捕房究辦、</p>
<p>捕房表示　法捕房當局對於本案經過表示非常滿意、並稱界內所有居民、一旦遇有盜刦、均能如此十五歲之幼女奮勇報警之精神、而予捕房以無上之助力、則不獨捕房表示感慰即嗣後界內盜刦案件、亦必逐漸減少也、</p>
<h3>赫德路破獲毒品機關</h3>
<p>係韓籍老婦主持　購者販者均被拘</p>
<p>湖南人白金衛、向在滬西勞勃生路英華里三四一五號開設燕子窠、容留烟民在內吸食毒品、前日下午四時半、因原料告罄、乃飭派同鄉婦人陳李氏出外購買海洛英二元五角、詎陳李氏買得海洛英後、行　赫德路口、突被流氓皖人楊光玉所悉、乃上前</p>
<p>藉端敲詐　意圖勒令將海洛英交出、氏未尤、遂起爭執楊即據情報告華捕、將楊及陳李氏一併帶入戈登路捕房、搜出毒品一包、當經華探長朱夢威詳加請問、氏承認此項毒品、由白金衛囑往赫德路趙家橋五十七弄十五號高麗婦人處購來、中西探核供乃會同日領事署、探前往、將</p>

<p>又受刺激　突生厭世之心、先將所餐之畫眉鳥摔地踏死、時其妻已尋獲其子回家、李見妻與子歸、即將身上所藏之存摺取出、擲於檯上、對其妻及子云、這由你們去活命罷、遂即返身出外、其妻與子恐生變故、即尾隨李至貝家門房、李對妻云、</p>
<p>去找老爺　說話、直向內走、斯時李即至貝之花園中自殺、其妻在門房等候許久、命子偕另一小孩進內找尋、遂發覺李開槍自殺、倒臥於園中草地上、即由貝宅電話、報告捕房車送醫院、不及救治身死、昨日上午十一時、由捕房報請</p>

<h3>現代政治與中國（續）</h3>
<p>— 君山</p>
<p>其次是提高工作的效能。因為近代的國家無時無刻不在鬥爭狀態中，所以要準備快，如準備慢了，就會打敗，被侵略，被壓迫。因此各個國家都不得不有很大的效能的工作，要有此很大效能的工作須具備：</p>
<p>第一·要求有責任加專的政府；</p>
<p>第二·要求有計劃加詳的政府；</p>
<p>第三·要求有技衛加精的政府；</p>
<p>第四·要求有經驗加多的政府；</p>
<p>第五·要求有時間加快的政府；</p>
<p>這五點是增加效能所不可缺者，缺其一，效能便減低。多黨政治有沒有方法成功這樣政府呢？分權，會議，統不可能，因為如是而有多數人決定，如是而有多數人商討，如是而有多數人牽制，那一種事能作得好呢？在表面上多黨政治的議會形式，是大家負責；其實就是大家不負責。所以，今天應一反過去，要求有負責任的政治，掃除議會政治。換言之，就是第一是要責任事一</p>
<p>第二是要有計劃。過去遇到一問題，發言盈庭，莫衷一是，在會議裏，你提出，他反對；他提出，你不贊成；也許到了明天，他贊同你昨天意見而你又反對。本來，在理論上說，集思廣益是好的；但在事實上却恰相反。愈討論，愈糊塗，愈討論，愈糾紛，真是令人不免有金兵業已渡河面宋人議猶未定之慨。</p>

<h3>力</h3>
<p>— （狩崙）</p>
<p>因為氣體的膨脹力量，於是頑鐵所造成的機關也會得靈活地運轉了；因為拉縴人拚命的向前背着走的緣故，於是滿載着的船也跟着向前了；在鐵鎚的猛擊底下，粗厚的鐵塊壓成了細薄的絲片；在深厚的大氣層的重壓底下，人們還能够鮮靈的活動着的原因，便是仗着那雄偉的體力超勝於大氣壓力的緣故；…………簡單說句話，凡是力所達到的地方，一切的志願都可以完成。古代有名的科學家阿基米德曾經說過一句有名的豪語道：“畀吾以立足之地，吾將運轉地球。”正就是這個意思。</p>
<p>因此吾們敢大胆的說：“凡‘力之所及，’能使‘宇宙變色。’”</p>
<p>不單是物質界的現象是這樣，就是精神上的一切，也沒有不是這樣的。一個國家的權力伸張到別國的領土裏去的時候，地圖的顏色就要改變了。</p>
<p>因此吾們不活在世間也罷了。倘若有意一定要求生活在這個世界上的話，且不管對付的是什麼事物，誰都要長養出較高較大的力來的。</p>
<h3>幾個偉人的怪癖</h3>
<p>— 孟喬</p>
<p>癖是一種怪嗜好，可以說是人人都有。怪癖則為怪嗜好中之尤怪者譬如本刊曾記載過某人專好收集中醫藥方等等都是。第三者看去有怪癖者必有精神病，最低的限度他的腦子也必失常。近來閱讀世界名人傳記，發現偉人們差不多全有怪癖，我真不明白是腦子失常方能成偉人，或是成偉人後腦子必失常，現在節錄幾則怪得可笑的怪癖：法國文豪左拉氏E.Zola寫作餘暇喜歡在巴黎街道上細數煤氣燈的數目。對於每條街煤氣燈的數目，他的日記裏記載得很詳細。</p>
<p>英國文人約翰森，S.Johnson則好數街上的闌干。他走過一座大建築時他必以手杖數每一根闌干，他相信數錯了的時候，便重新再數不怕麻煩。</p>
<p>德國詩人雪勃F.VonSchiller每逢作詩時，兩隻脚必須赤足踏在一方冰上，一年四季皆如是。</p>
<p>法國政治家勒萬氏G·deNarvel氏飯後散步時，常常牽着一隻活的大頭蝦。他用一根美麗的絲繩擊着蝦身，任牠前後亂跳，他慢慢的隨在後面。路人圍着爭看的時候，他就說：“這大頭蝦就是我的哈叭狗，靜悄悄的多老實？人們可以牽着狗在街上走，我當然可以牽着大頭蝦來散步！”</p>
<h3>詩童周天健</h3>
<p>— 薇芳</p>
<p>小詩人周天健，湖口人，今年已十四歲了。在他三歲的時候，因避亂遷居九江，遇到一位不知名的相面先生，說他天才很好，將來一定大有造就的。因為伊那時一張活潑玲瓏的面龐，已充分地表現出聰明的樣子。</p>
<p>他的父親是一個讀書人，也曾做過官，平日對於他很歡喜，常常教導他識字，加以他有天才，無怪要有驚人的成續了。</p>
<p>在五歲的光景，他對於詩詞就極感興趣，唐宋古詩，都能背誦講解並且還能做一二首。他的父親看見之後，驚奇他的天才，也不時的指點。於是他終日除吟詩之外，其他可說是什麼都不做，不過他的書畫，却亦非常可觀。</p>
<p>某天，他父親講給文天祥史可法的事蹟，他圓睜了兩眼，凝神注視的聽。末後，他慷慨地說：“像這一種人，我們是須要模仿的。本來，一個人的死，有重於泰山，有輕於鴻毛，我們不要無聲無息的與草木同腐。…………”</p>
<p>他還微笑的說：“我就這樣地做一個民族的詩人吧。後來，他努力的求讀，不到幾年的結果。有了相當的造詣，當然是容易進步的，賦詩為文，斐然成章，一時他的大名傳遍了當地。每有文人雅士設宴，招小詩人參與，席間假使有何疑問，他均能對答如流，賦詩迅速，工而佳妙，莫不目之為神童。有一次，考試院長戴季陶先生道經九江，召往面試，竟使戴院長嘆賞不止。</p>
<p>現在，他已有積詩二百餘首，曰籟園吟草，其詞句清新雋永，豪麗雄壯，確是難能可貴的。我們相信，再過幾年之後，這一位民族小詩人，一定能名聞全國了。</p>
<h3>叮鼕擔</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>“叮鼕…………叮鼕……………”在我們這一條衖堂的裏面，每天可以聽到幾次這樣的“叮鼕”之聲，衹是下雨天是例外。</p>
<p>就為了每天有得聽見這種聲音似乎也聽慣了，所以連得抱在手裏的孩子們，祇要聽到了“叮鼕”“叮鼕”的聲音，也會不加猶豫的說是叮鼕擔來啦。那時你推出門去，準會看見一個人，一手在推動一架有輪盤的叮鼕擔，一手在很熟練的搖盪一個叮鼕鼓，木架子的裏面是一面鑼和一個鼓，祇要手一搖，鑼和鼓就會同時的響了起來。</p>
<p>接二連三的每天有叮鼕擔推進衖堂來，“叮鼕…………叮鼕…………”這聲音也似乎聽得有些討厭了，特別是在我們的窗口，推叮鼕擔的人也要“叮鼕”，“叮鼕”的搖起來，有時孩子們睡着，會被這種聲音鬧醒，真有說不出的討厭。然而憑是我怎樣的厭惡，叮鼕擔還是不斷的有得推進來，也是奈何他們不得。</p>
<p>一副叮鼕擔，可以說是一爿流動的小型百貨商店，因為在這叮鼕擔上，不論什麼華洋百貨，家用什物，都有出售，所謂麻雀雖小，五臟俱全。特別是娘兒們用的化裝品，針線，以及孩子們心愛的玩具，充斥其間，甚至各種糖菓也有出售。不過擔上的商品，也不是固定的，會隨了時季而變換；譬如到了冬天，衛生衫，絨襪子，絨線，蜜糖，都擺出了；到了夏天，就換上一批汗衫，汗褲，扇子，蒼蠅拍一類東西；像在廢曆的新年之中，那麼玩具，花炮，擺得最多。</p>
<p>叮鼕擔進來啦，除了孩子們都要圍上去之外，那些娘姨們，女傭之類，也會來不及跑出去買些東西，因為伊們每天在不停的工作，抽不出閒到外面去買。就是主婦們缺少一些零星的雜物，貪便當，有人送上門來，省得跑出去，也就在叮鼕擔上買了。所以一架叮鼕擔進來，多少會賣掉一些東西的。叮鼕擔上買東西，價錢並不十分貴，和外面差不多，衹是商品多半是次貨，好的買不到，尤其是×貨，近來特別的多。</p>
<p>偶然和一個挑叮鼕擔的人談過天，知道叮鼕擔雖然也因為擔的大小，商品的多少，而資本有所不同，但比較好些的擔子，也要百多塊錢做成功，商品充足一些，至少要三五百塊錢。可知雖然是小本經紀，資本倒也不小。前幾年市況比較好一些，他們每天可做十多塊錢生意，但近年來為了整個都市的衰落，也受到了嚴重的影響，平均每天祇有五六塊錢的生意呢。</p>

<h3>海鹽太子廟探梅記</h3>
<p>— （俠虎）</p>
<p>超山梅花數十里，並有唐宋古梅，因以著名。詎不知海鹽太子廟梅花，亦有數里之遙，亦有唐宋古梅，祇以地處海濱，交通不便，至今猶未得與超梅齊名，梅花之有幸有不幸如此。雖然，天下事，大都如此，又豈僅梅花已哉。</p>
<p>廟在縣城北門外，塑漢皇甫太尉像，俗誤太子，因名太子廟，廟貌傾圯，已呈頹象，平時既無遊客，又無香火，惟梅花盛放時，城中少數土女，徘徊於此香雪梅中耳。日前余與程雪門雇車往觀，出其北門，二旁人家，盡在梅花中，直至太子廟而止。北門通太子廟大道，為張韶舞縣長蒞鹽後所築。聞張縣長在鹽時，尚不貪錢，文官不貪錢，便是好官。一昨來滬，訪辛豐綢廠李公漁君，據云柳營路附近梅園，梅花正盛，亦有老幹多枝，婆娑可愛，人事鞅掌，未知能否償此尋梅之願耳。</p>
<p>人物小志</p>
<h3>一個世界上最年青的軍官</h3>
<p>— 平凡</p>
<p>菲里克梭沙雷洛，生於一九一九年二月於西班牙阿爾加柴。他成長於貧困與勞動之中。十四歲，就做泥水匠了。他很同情社會主義青年團，於是便加入了；同時他也加入勞動者總同盟為會員過了三年的工團生活，他便成了一位有意識的革命軍人了。法西斯叛變爆發，他就立刻奔向阿爾加柴的民團，而到了前線。上年七八月間，他轉戰於山岡，即被推為隊長，後來，更由於他的英勇的領導，被舉為副官。</p>
<p>在托勒杜的槍林彈雨之中，他勇敢地負着那些傷臥在街上的老姬而救之出險。司令官曾向他致敬，他却謙虛地拒絕了，說：“這不過盡我的任務罷了。”</p>
<p>在瑪德里前線，二百個民團曾佔據了一所在火線裏的屋子。突然，敵人進攻了，菲里克梭的戰士們竟放棄了陣線。</p>
<p>“你們為什麼逃跑？”他喊着：“我們要立刻去奪回來！”</p>
<p>他高聲地向逃避的戰士們說。</p>
<p>僅有二十個同志跟着他，但也足够了，他們用着手溜彈和排槍把那所屋子又重新奪了回來。在沙雷洛及其同伴們的堅決固守之前，更大多數的敵人當摩洛士人被他們擊弊而倒下去的時候奔逃了。</p>
<p>因為那個地位是非常重要，司令部這次又向他致賀。他得到了軍官的榮銜。他現在是十七歲。</p>
<p>“你為什麼要加入民團？”新聞記者曾這樣問他。</p>
<p>“這是我必然的任務。”他簡短地回答，接着又說：“因為我們青年大眾願意自由地生活，因此我們必須要隨時驅逐法西斯蒂劊子手。這一次戰爭，就是為了人民大眾的更幸福的生活的權利而決鬥。我們一定會得到勝利的！”</p>
<p>幾天以前，農民青年團的一個支隊舉行會議，一個政治委員向他們說：“你們將由沙雷洛軍官來指揮了，你們同意嗎？”</p>
<p>大家都歡呼贊成。現在菲里克梭•沙雷洛，那位世界上最年青的軍官，率領着那青年組成的人民軍的砲兵大隊，他們每一個對於鬥爭的目標與意義都了解得很明白。</p>
<h3>換巢鴛鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十二回（白版紅箋空還兩行涙荻花楓葉獨步半城秋）</p>
<p>國器道：富然是男方先向女方通信，這是無待於問的。小松道：第一次信上，寫了些什麼？國器這：當然是很客氣的話。其實直至現在，信上還是很客氣的話。小松這就對他臉上望着去了。因道：你不是說了，這是小說上的人物嗎？怎麼你又說到現在還是很客氣。難道這兩個人，現在的情形你全都知這。國器說到現在兩個字，本來想忍了回去的。不想話出如風沒有法子抹煞。心裏也就立刻想着，要用什麼法子把話兜轉。小松一問他，先默然的笑了一笑。小松道：老哥，你究竟是個老實人，說來說去，你也就把消息漏了。其實是空中樓閣也罷，真有其人也罷，甚至乎就是你也罷，這都是我所不必問的。我只有一個建議，在你這幾首詩裏，真個此中有人，呼之欲出。這樣好的女子，令人可愛，因為他太富於詩味了。但是林黛玉式的女子，現在又不合乎時代了，你必定寫得他戰勝了不良的處境，和這個男人成為一對嶄新的夫妻，這是說你作小說的話。假使真有其人，我們當出一臂之力，讓他得着自由。不要獨立西風落照前，一味的傷感。國器道：那很難寫，寫成了大團圓的結局，必是落於腐套。小松將詩摘放在桌上，也不知幾時，女僕已是放了一杯茶在桌上。這就把那杯子捧起，慢慢的喝着，微笑道：你作小說，總是寫哀情，那不好。至少，你也應當寫一對陪客，寫得他們的婚姻，非常圓滿。國器笑道：我還找不着這種陪客，把你寫上去罷。不過你所賞識的，全是板橋雜記的人物。我對於這一道，又十分外行。（一四八）</p>

<h3>醫學應積極提倡科學訓練</h3>
<p>— 陳志潛</p>
<p>（轉載民間半月刊第三卷第二十一期）</p>
<p>三中全會第三次會議，焦委員易堂等提議請責成教育部明令制定中醫教學規程，編入教育學制。李委員宗黃等請實行五全大會中西醫平等待遇決議原案。在今日國難當前百廢待舉的時代，此種議案根本不甚重要，無提出的價值。但從醫學本身問題着想，似有幾點，請焦李諸位委員們加以考慮。</p>
<p>中國今日採用西洋工程學術，修造偉人酷愛居住的洋房，建築溝通文化的公路鐵路，未曾聽說中國應當保存舊式木匠瓦匠的手藝，來對抗近代工程的學術。同時今日人人希望政府採用外國軍隊的組織與設備，未曾聽說人要主張保存中國舊有兵勇式的操演與刀槍，以鞏固國防。惟獨國人借用科學為發展醫學的基礎，確引起社會的劇烈反應與中西醫的無味爭執，真是可笑！焦李各委員的動機不外乎：</p>
<p>一，有些病人用西法治療無效，改用中藥而得良好結果，於是人謂中西醫有並存的價值。</p>
<p>據此論者，應當認識“西醫”的長處是在應用科學觀察實驗的方法，以研究生理變化之關係，不僅包括區區治療疾病的方術。假如“中醫”承認科學的價值，明白科學的方法，再充分引用科學觀察實驗方法去研究“中醫”的內容，與考查“中醫”治療的結果，我們當然十分歡迎。惜乎一般中醫都不明白科學方法與內容，靠“中醫”去研究“中醫”學理，絕對不可能。若有一二位，精通西醫的基礎科學，從事“中醫”研究；其結果是“西醫”研究“中醫”，絕對不是“中醫”研究“中醫”了！</p>
<p>同時沒有科學的根底，就不能證明“有效”“無效”的說法。個別的事例，固然值得上注意，但是不僅科學方法的鑑別，個人經驗在自然科學上永久不是學術，也永久無普遍性。假如中醫們崇拜中醫者都墨守個別的事例，不顧近代科學方法的應用，我固無話可說，中醫也就永遠不能成為世界公認的學術！就在科學醫學發源的地方（歐美各國），現在還有許多人相信偏方秘劑。但這些偏方秘劑未經科學方法整理前，不能公認為“有效”或“無效”。不學無術的人對於此點，也許永久不會了解的！</p>
<p>二，近年衛生行政人才都受過西醫的訓練，而未曾學習中醫的方術。學西醫者未能研究中醫的內容，是今日中國學術界的一種缺憾。誠然，各醫學院應當有專門人才，運用科學方法，整理幾千百年的國粹。但是此項工作，異常繁重。以今日人財兩乏情形而論，“西醫”研究“中醫”往往是辦不到，並不是不願辦與不當辦。研究既不可能，真理既不可得，結果只好把“中醫”課程放在一邊而以有科學根據的“西醫”作教學基礎。這就是西醫不懂中醫的原因。衛生行政人才未曾學習中醫的方術，並非他們不願學，只是辦醫學校者，不知如何把未經鑑別的中醫內容拿來訓練衛生行政的人才。而且衛生行政包括生命統計，傳染病管理，衛生工程等學術，在“中醫”裏，是找不出來的。如用中醫去主持衛生行政，豈不又是笑話！</p>
<p>三，推廣西醫有碍於“膏丹丸散”商人的利益，於是飯碗問題成為中西交爭的焦點。</p>
<p>中國工業落後，製造力薄弱，於應用科學方面，大量採用舶來品，於國民經濟，似為不利，這是推銷西藥的害處。救濟的辦法，以有㊀鼓勵基本工業的改進，㊁繼續推用必需的舶來品。國人不用舶來的飛機大砲，自己永久不會想法製造飛機大砲，要想國人自造“西藥”，也必須藉用外來品以開發市場。這種眼前虧，是無法避免的！</p>
<p>至於舊有的“膏丹丸散”，如果證明有普遍的效力，將來不只銷行國內，並且可以變作東洋西洋各國的舶來品。如果證明無效，一部份自然逐漸淘汰，絕不會因中央委員們的提議而得以幸存。要知道今日明達之士並不反對“膏丹丸散”的買賣，但懷疑此種藥品的根據而已。中央委員們應當鼓勵這種的懷疑，而促進應用科學研究“中醫”的動機。如何因一部份人飯碗的臨時變動，而犧牲國家永久學術的根基，無乃眼光太短，這種保障“膏丹丸散”的辦法，徒以斷送其命而已！</p>
<p>除此以外，當然還有當局彼此感情衝突，故意為難，與其他私人問題，無法過問。我但願焦李諸位委員們提議㊀廢除“中”“西”醫的稱呼，一律統稱國醫。㊁衛生署成立國醫研究所，把中西著名醫師集中首都，作醫學的研究。㊂預備將研究所得結果，加入醫學院的課程。</p>
<p>一個國家為一種學術與職業有兩種基礎訓練不同的學校，是大笑話，再有兩個能力（衛生行政）懸殊的人員，受平等待遇，也是滑稽！只要教育部以科學訓練為醫學基礎，那怕掛的牌子是中醫專科學校或是醫學院，所得的結果早晚一樣，本來學“中醫”的青年都會走入“西醫”途徑以造成中國的國醫！</p>
<h3>改良的吃飯方式</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>古人說得好：“取人之長，補己之短，”又說：“擇善而從，”這句話的意思，引申來說，就是人家的長處，我們不去學他，一味的故步自封，這就呌做頑固，但是不問人家的好壤，一味的跟着人跑，那又近於盲從；頑固者不靈，盲從者不智；其愚均，其失亦等。</p>
<p>衣食住行，為人生必要的四件事。在今日中國的都市裏面，衣住行三項，似已大部分歐化起來，獨對於飲食方面，尚多數守着中國的老法子。</p>
<p>喫飯，似乎是四件事中最重要的一件事了！中國和外國的喫法，可說完全不同。到底中國對呢？還是外國對呢？我以為是各有其利弊的。喫飯的條件有二：一要衛生，二要經濟。外國是分食制度，每人一份的喫着，不問一桌有多少人，由飲食方面傳染疾病的危險，總不至於發生。這種喫法，當然合於衛生。但是經濟二字却談不到。中國是共食制度，一桌上放着幾隻菜，可供七八人佐餐之用，經濟是經濟极了！可是衛生呢？那與分食制度相去得太遠了！一盆菜，幾雙筷子在裏面夾來夾去，一碗湯，幾隻匙子在裏面攪來攪去。祇要內中有一個傳染病的患者，隨時就有傳染於同食者的危險。就是沒有傳染病，那唾沫和牙垢也就够人分潤的了！同時中國人喫飯，以口就碗，低着頭，彎着腰，中國四五十歲的人，多為駝背，其造成的原因，大概由於伏案讀書和伏桌喫飯而來。更有些人是以口吸食，吸時聲門大開，食物可隨着吸氣竄入氣管，以致嗆咳，飯屑唾沫噴得一桌，公共的菜裏湯裏，多少要噴入一些進去。就是不傳染，也就免不了旁人的討厭。還有一點，一手持碗，一手執箸，一頓飯未喫完，左手已經有些酸痛。凡此種種，皆是中國喫法不衛生還加不便利的地方，為外國喫法所沒有的。</p>
<p>由上所述，可知外國喫法，衛生而不經濟，中國喫法，經濟而不衛生，所謂各有其利弊者在此。有許多人要改良中國的喫飯制度，主張完全效法外國人的分食，可是在中國的經濟情形之下，中等階級以下的家庭完全分食是不易實現的，因為太不經濟的緣故。為了經濟問題而又要不違衛生條件，於是又有人主張每人用兩雙筷子，一以取菜，一以喫飯，可是一個記不清，喫飯的筷子會伸入菜碗，取菜的筷子可送入口內，仍然是無濟於事的。以上二法，既皆難適用，現在且把鄙人家庭中數年來所實行的法子介紹給大眾。</p>
<p>這方法很簡單，除飯碗外，每人一匙一箸，箸是專管取菜的，匙是專管喫飯的。另外再置公匙二三隻，專為各人取湯之用。凡要喫湯時，先用公匙放入私匙（喫飯的匙），然後送入口內，喫飯時也是用箸取菜，置於匙中。這種吃法的好處，第一是避免傳染，第二是不致駝背和嗆咳，因為不要以口就食或以氣吸食。第三是匙箸各別，極易記憶，不致混亂不清，第四是不要以手持碗，可免手酸。中國吃法的毛病，可謂一舉而除，同時中國喫法的好處——經濟却絕對地保持着。這種方法可說得是有共食之名，而有分食之實，有分食之益，而又有共食之利同時，分食共食的流弊皆一掃而空。有志改進中國喫飯問題的人，何不一試之呢？</p>
<p>外國習慣，有許多是值得我們模仿的。可是要吸取牠的精華，不必死守牠的格式，這才呌做取長補短，才呌做擇善而從。</p>
<h3>今後吾國醫學教育之展望（上）</h3>
<p>— 常時煐</p>
<p>現代醫學之輸入中國已經有整整一百零一年的歷史了。在這一百年內的前七十五年，中國的醫學教育和事業全由私人主持，其中大部分是西洋傳教士所經營的。這些年內，他們很忠實的推進他們的工作和事業，所以他們結果樹立了中國現代醫學的基礎，這是我們人人都承認並且十二分羨慕的。事實上，直到現在，在西洋傳教士主持和外國資助之下的醫科學校和醫院在中國仍然佔很重要的地位。</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>﻿很可慶幸的，現在中國政府對於全國醫學教育已經負起管理和計劃的責任來了。國內現有醫學教育之場所可別為三種如下：</p>
<p>㊀政府設立，或與政府合立，及各省公立省立，一·北平大學醫學院，二·國立中央大學醫學院，三·國立同濟大學醫科，四·國立中山大學醫科，五·浙江公立醫藥專門學校，六·河北大學醫科，七·東北大學醫科，八·太原醫學專門學校，九·南昌醫學專門學校，十·湖北中山大學醫科，十一·北平陸軍軍醫學校。</p>
<p>㊁國人私立！一·南通大學醫科，二·同德醫學專門學校，三·南洋醫科大學，四·東南醫科學校，五·奉天醫學專門學校，六·大廈大學醫科，七·女子醫學專門學校。</p>
<p>㊂外國教會建立或外人私立！一·北平協和醫科大學，二·廣濟醫學專門學校，三·南滿醫科大學，四·湘雅醫學專門學校，五·光華醫學專門學校。</p>
<p>此外還有國內研究新醫學團體述之，一·中華民國醫藥學會，二·中華醫學會，三·博醫會，四·中華德醫學會。</p>
<p>上面的一段話，是略說現今吾國醫學教育之進步，就是正在萌芽時代，幼稚得很，我們醫學界的人物，還要切實的注意，要得將來的發展才是，這不過是一個基礎而已，要得將來發展，非要解除下面一切錯誤。和依照下面之一切條例。</p>
<p>甲、剷除派別觀念</p>
<p>今日（吾國醫校，僅有一級制，固易收統一之效，即將來有兩級制醫校產生，亦望各級間程度能相齊。何也，今日我國醫事教育之大病，在於全國各醫校所授之課程，彼此參差不齊，不寗惟是，即各校用以教授醫事教育之語文，亦不一致，有用英日文者，有用法德文者，豈視醫事教育亦同舶來品物，即以販賣為目的其如差之毫厘，謬以千里何，夫新醫為世界公共之學術，絕非任何一國所獨有，吾人即以此世界公共之學術，介紹至中國，則自應以中國之語言文字，從而教導之，若猶運用外國文字，則易予人誤解，視運用某國文字教授之學識的醫學，謂之某國醫學，故欲謀整理中國之醫事教育，應先糾正教授法上用外國語言文字上錯誤，用國文教授，使之統一，此為極關重要之第一點，其次即將中國醫學教育之制度及課程，為有系統有組織之編製，使全國各校，無論一級制兩級制均宜趨於一律，無復彼此參差之弊，如國人能切實由此兩點，努力進行，則中國醫學教育之前途，自可樂觀，不然有如盲人瞎馬，夜臨深池，其不顛覆者幾希，抑吾國醫界，今日最不良之現象，莫如各樹派別，不幸派別之分，今已明顯，此在醫學十分幼稚之中國，實為厄運，蓋今日中國之醫學，較之列强，婢學夫人，尚嫌弗如，烏能夜郎自大，自稱派別，派別生，則自必彼欺爾，妬嫉排擠，互相水火，安望團結一致，共求進步，此誠堪為吾國醫學前途，長歎息者，竊謂研究新醫之我曹，亟應虛懷若谷，互相切磋，互相探討，庶因之而有心得，籍可發明，今則深中派別之毒，合作精神，日趨渙散，竟致格格不相入，言之實可痛心，所望今後國人之從事醫學者，學習時固宜求澈底了解，潛心研求，學成後尤貴能以本國語文，繹述介紹，譬之食物，有消化能力，始得營養之功，否則學自某國，祇能用某國之文字發表，而不能代之以中國之語言文字，則謂之食古不化，亦奚以異，興念及此，覺吾人應將關於醫學上應用之各種單字及術語，均一一繹出，使之異常明晰，不僅成一辭典，尤須集五六國之文字，成一中西之對照表，此實異常切要之圖，例如、一方全用中國文字，一方以拉丁文為主體，以英法德意日等國文字為賓，如是則可免除國人以外國文字發表醫學上事物之弊病，至於欲泯滅學校及教授醫生間之派別，則當另籌方策，其方法余曾與同志數輩一再討論，咸表同情於余之主張，余之主張為何，即設置一醫學研究院，聘請自歐美日本學成歸來之醫學博士，凡學醫有專門者，不論其學自何國，祇求其學術有特長，有志於繼續研究更圖深造之士，均能延攪入內，在院研究期間，最短須經歷二三年間，會萃自各國學醫歸來之人才，各就其所常，互相砥礪，如是數年，則不獨彼此間互解所學，益能進步，容有新的發明，且相處既久，性格行為，亦能互相了解，隔閡盡除，於是於無形中忘却自身學自何國，派別觀念，亦可隨之消滅矣，不特此也，一方從事研究，一方且可預為未來教授之計，而不時練習，故此醫學研究院，乃不啻醫事教育之師範學校，能養成全國健全之醫學師資，倘此計實行，則全國醫學教授，胥由是出，逾十年後，全國醫學教育始有真正統一之可言，故此種醫學研究院之設置，實為當務之急，治本之源，而同時藥學研究院之組織，亦當相提並進，此則整理全國醫學教育之澈底辦法也。</p>
<h3>京滬蘇浙贛湘鄂等處衛生視察報告（六）</h3>
<p>— 儲晉芳</p>
<p>乙　各醫學校</p>
<p>一·國立同濟大學醫學院</p>
<p>同濟大學醫學院，為德人寶隆氏所創設，歐戰後，始歸國立，校址位於吴淞。兹將該校醫學院之各部，列述如左：</p>
<p>㊀解剖館</p>
<p>㊁生理學研究館</p>
<p>㊂生物館—動物館</p>
<p>㊃化學研究館</p>
<p>㊄病理研究館</p>
<p>㊅藥物學研究館</p>
<p>㊆細菌學研究館</p>
<p>㊇公共衛生講座</p>
<p>九臨床各科</p>
<p>各館科設備完善，並有研究工作，堪稱國内完備醫學院之一也。該院學生臨床實習，向在上海寶隆醫院，現擬將上海市立醫院劃歸該學院為實習之處。</p>
<p>該校經費，全部每年共七十萬元，醫學院占二十餘萬元，其中有二十餘萬元為工學院之經費，其餘二十餘萬元為該校附設高級中學及高級職業學校之經費。醫學院之教授均為德籍，國人僅為副教授耳。</p>
<p>該校特設精細機械修理處，司修理職務者亦為德人，係德國Leit工廠岀身，諸凡精細之儀器如顯微鏡等，均能修理。此人係學校與上海德商洋行合請，薪金每月為三百元，學校與洋行各半負担。該項儀器修理之設備，洵我國醫學界之創舉也。</p>
<h3>國産之藥用植物（續）</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>（一零一）杮　Diospyros　Kaki,L.F.</p>
<p>（植物）屬杮樹科Ｅbenaceae之植物，自生於山中，又多被栽植，落葉喬木也。葉互生，短柄，表面滑澤，作倒卵形或廣橢圓形，全縁，急尖頭。雌雄同株。梅雨之候，腋岀單性花，雄花為聚繖花序，小形，概為３個，雌花單立，大形。漿果作球形或扁球形，色紅即熟。</p>
<p>（生藥）杮𦺳Ｃalyx　Kaki,，係採集附着於果實之萼片而乾燥之者也。木器作淡緑色或黄褐色，分四裂，裂片作卵形，長達15-20公厘，内面有短毛。味顯著，有收歛性。</p>
<p>（成分）杮𦺳含有融點2750Ｃ之無窒素結晶性物質。</p>
<p>果肉含有轉化糖14％内外，遊離酸0.3％（以林擒酸為主），鞣酸，酸化酵素等。</p>
<p>種子之胚乳中，含有多量之Maunan</p>
<p>生於乾杮表面之白粉，為甘露酵（Mannit）</p>
<p>杮澀液，含有Ｓhibuol（實騐式C14H20O9）之鞣酸模樣物質。</p>
<p>關於杮之脱澀，澀杮脱澀，通常以之置於殘留酒精之酒桶中，或浸於30-40。之温湯中，經十二小時即成。此法無他，即以其細胞中之酸化酵素，蓄積於細胞空隙中之鞣酸，發生作用，而使其細胞死滅之操作也。結果鞣酸被酸化而成為無味之物質。日本澤村氏為證明此法，曾經實騐。將澀杮剖成兩半，其一以氯仿蒸氣，便發生作用後，行使分析，内中含有糖量15.91％，而鞣酸已無。而未經氯仿作用之他半，則含有糖量16.18％，鞣酸8.23％。故杮之脱澀，糖量殆無增减，但因鞣酸之消失，愈益感其甘美矣。</p>
<p>（藥用）舊説：杮𦺳治吃逆不止有效。一回用量為８公分，作煎劑用。</p>
<p>處方例：杮𦺳湯，治吃逆有效。</p>
<p>杮𦺳，丁香　各八·○　生薑　三·○</p>
<p>以上作煎劑一○○，頓服。</p>
<p>杮乾（杮餅）或杮霜（附於杮餅表面之白粉），有鎮咳之效。</p>

<h3>偷運銅元出口</h3>
<p>— 映純</p>
<p>日鮮人在華北走私已成為公開的秘密，而且這行動，不及半年就遍行於中國的南北各地了。就我國的主權看來，這無疑的是違法的事。可是到目前為止，我國當局不特未能採取有效的防止方法，而且反而任其變本加厲！當初不過是明來暗去，到後來竟敢明火搶劫的打起關員來了。這不用說都是非常使人言之痛心的。不過這種事情，當初僅不過出現於中央權力不逮的地方吧了，想不到如今竟連眾目睽睽的上海，也演起這種武劇來。</p>
<p>據二十一日報載：前日晚上十二時後，有私運銅元的日鮮浪人百餘名，集中提籃橋匯山碼頭對面的日旅館“日本館”內，每人身穿特製衣服，衣上遍佈巨型口袋，滿裝銅元，每人約達五千枚左右，總數約值一萬七八千元，陸續由匯山碼頭登‘上海丸’，沿途均有浪人佈哨，戒備甚嚴：至昨晨三時許，正值最後一批浪人滿裝銅元登船時，被海關關員發覺，即上前搜查，不意浪人等竟出預藏鐵尺等兇器，向關員毆擊，結果有中西關員七人，被擊受傷甚重，其中一人，手骨竟被擊斷。駐滬日總領得報，即派員到輪，先將關員等救出，並以此事業已揭破，只好令浪人繳出銅元約二三千元，分裝兩卡車運往海關，以卸責任，其餘一萬餘元，仍裝“上海丸”運出。</p>
<p>據另一消息又補充着說：浪人偷運銅元出口已歷時甚久，本市吳淞路及公館馬路一帶，均有奸商代日人收買；每次日輸出口輒裝去大批銅元，此項秘密，至昨晨始行揭破。本市月前因日方收買過多，以至銅元價格飛漲，其後幸中央銀行兌出大批一分銅輔幣，始漸平定，惟某方現仍亳無顧忌，照常偷運，昨所破獲，不過一小部分而已。</p>
<p>以上面的事實看來，自然可以想見日鮮人之偷運及走私，都是有組織和有計劃的，不然，我國的關員就不致慘遭骨斷之禍。同時，日人之蠻橫强暴，藐視我國的主權，於此也就可以想見。我們不必管他私運銅元，是否為了製造砲彈之用，但是在此刻中日經濟提携，正在高唱入雲的聲中，一再意圖擾亂我國金融，即使彼方是如何誠意，也不敢使人置信的。這次銅元出口之弄出毆打關員的事件，我想大約總可算作着迷於中日提携的人們底一個當頭棒，使大家醒一醒了吧？</p>
<h3>北極星</h3>
<p>— 羅鬱</p>
<p>窗上一方冷落的天靄，夜的黑手指在那角上飾了幾顆金色的星。風已不再吹過，是在冷落而暗悒的一方畫布上開得明亮了。</p>
<p>這幾顆星，互相撁連，像在遙遠的那邊作捕鵝的游戲。這樣的遊戲是我童年最愛玩的，現在可又記起了，又看見了。我是睡在我底床上，從被絮里䀹着眼睛。外頭却很寒冷。</p>
<p>我搬到這里已三天了。我初次從我底床上望見這幾顆星，我底靈魂幾乎笑出聲音，我幾乎流涙。當我從被絮里䀹着眼睛，穿過這晦暗的屋內的空氣，逾過對面的房頂的黑橫線，我不能確定我曾走了多少遙遠，牠們正在作着我童年的古舊的捕鵝遊戲呵。</p>
<p>有一次夜深以后。巷里已一片清寂，該是夜鶯來訪的時候吧，但這里只充滿了狡獪的夢，我就連那可愛的鳥聲也不曾聽到，可是那星呢？却愈發開得叨亮，耀燦。</p>
<p>我已熟習牠們底位置；我可說不出牠們底名字。那名字藏在天文家底心里，又荘嚴，又美麗。倘若去把這探問一位天文家，那一定是多麼地有趣！多麼地驚奇！我却不能知道，而祇能深深地望過去，深深地且一秒不移地。從空隙流進的冷氣噓着我底眼睛。我底眼睛很倦了。牠們變成礓直，變成了遂石，變成了金箭，一秒不能轉移，一秒不能闔攏。那已不是屬於我的眼睛，那是星底兩位伙伴。</p>
<p>我看到那些星在冷落的畫布似的天靄上悄悄地潛移默轉。不知經過多少年代才送過來的牠們底遊戲是古老的，比古老的我們底祖先還更古老的；緩慢地進行着。夜更深了。牠們就挪到那畫布的下邊左角。</p>
<p>我作了夢：在夏夜的院子里，為我扇着蚊蚋的是孤獨的慈母。我把身子平躺在一條長登上，聽村外的影戲的歌聲送來寂靜的花葉上，我底眼睛斜睨着北天的羣星。</p>
<p>“媽，那是叫什麼的星？”我好奇地問：“那些一連串的星子。”</p>
<p>“那是北斗。”母親用沉靜的聲音說。</p>
<p>“那邊呢”我貪婪地問：“那在一道白雲邊的三個？”</p>
<p>“不是白雲，”母親用慈愛的聲音說：“那是天河；那個是牛郎；河這邊的是織女；還有一個是金牛。”</p>
<p>夜是悄悄地伏在大地上。星是冷落而迢遙。村外影戲的歌聲延入了深更，星就悄悄地潛移默轉。我看到一個星，我驚愕地問母親：“那個明亮的大星，牠為什麼不轉呢？”</p>
<p>“那顆明亮的大星，”母親用親切的聲音說：“那是北極星，他永遠不轉動。</p>
<p>我底眼前忽然躍起無數的耀燦與眩惑，星子們繞過天庭，急劇地飛轉，牠們繞着那大的永不移轉的星，拼出火花，拉成金線。</p>
<p>我歌頌着夢中的快樂。</p>
<h3>鬼火的故事</h3>
<p>— 流螢</p>
<p>很早柳鎮還只有三戶人家，零零落落的過着耕耘的生活。外山村是個亂葬崗子，所以時常有鬼火出沒。</p>
<p>外山村，是一片高坡，埋滿了墳塋，一些還栽着沒有名姓的石碑—也許是年代久遠，字給風雨磨滅了去。坡下是道小河，碧綠的水，老是像帶幾分斯文</p>
<h3>晨</h3>
<p>— 申冰</p>
<p>白濛濛的晨霧吹進我的房子，一扇窗昨夜给風推開了。氤氤在重衾之間的熱氣漸漸地舒散着，露在被筒外邊的頭在夢裏不禁縮了進來我做過一齣這樣不值言說的夢：覺得是那麼輕易地，一夜裏，伸手便搖落了滿天金色的星斗。而當醒來的時節，在昨夜的枕上，所能找到的，只是一堆冰涼的淚漬。</p>
<p>我掩起了窗。白色的霧氣與室內的緩氣失去對流。窗玻璃上的水霧凝成點滴溜掛下來，洗成透明的遼遠似的兩條空隙。窗外飛舞着漫天的霧。</p>
<p>遠處的海浪濺到岩石上又拖了白白的泡沫回去，只是記憶裹的風尖，則龐大的屋頂也透不過稠密的霧層。從遠至近濡染着一片勻凈的朦朧。</p>
<p>霧氣和露水濕透了行人的鞋面，且在被掀開的短髮上凝結無數的小水珠，各以默默的身影從屋隅走出，踽踽地消失在烟幕似的霧層中。偶然的車輛從路上輾過，不是車載着人行，而是人拉着車走，拉車人的背微微地駝着。</p>
<p>從豆腐店裏湧出来的白騰騰的蒸氣，瀰散在湫隘的街角上，門檻上的條小狗蜷伏着，像憇息在溫煦的爐邊似的。對街人家的門扇然地推開，門裏伸出一隻手向街心倒了一些東西，遂又輕輕掩上了。</p>
<p>門檻上的小狗划着矮短的腿，一溜烟地跑過去，在那堆被傾棄在路中的藥渣上嗅着，張出兩隻前腿來抓着，像抓着碎石路堅冷的胸。</p>
<p>從那家屋脊上的烟突炊烟已經挾着煤烟在盤旋了。</p>
<p>在稠密的霧圈以外，太陽伸出一點殷紅的舌頭，舐着勻凈的天空，濃霧像陽光下的積雪那麼地崩潰。一陣風凌空掃過，霧氣稀薄了。窗前遂有熹微的羅綺的裙裾，隨風而𦄵繂着。</p>
<p>一聲遠來的火車的汽笛劃破了為霧所凝冷的天空，看不清的鐵輪，貼在兩條發亮的平行軌上滾過，噴着喘哮的煤烟。疑是從遠處載着早晨的曦光而來。</p>
<p>晨安！</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>似的不息流動，水面上有波紋，同時還聽見淙淙的細晋。</p>
<p>柳鎮三家人，是他們的祖宗擔了家私，從遼遠的山西搬得來，那時彷彿還是什麼大清皇帝時代。他們沒有任何企望，在荒蕪地面住下，勤懇的每天墾殖耕種，冬天還結夥往山裏去割柴。沒有寂寞，也不覺着單調，雖然只是十多口子的一戶人家。</p>
<p>一個殘秋之夜，柳鎮的四週充滿了寂靜。他們從山裏割完柴歸來，路上，大順子唱着山歌，忽然間天氣陰沉下來，秋虫都停止叫鳴。他們一行人都記起了老人講的鬼怪故事，越想越怕，六順子也停止了歌聲，他們每一個人的心底都感着同樣的懼怕恐怖，連脚步也顯得有幾分吃力。</p>
<p>六順子：什麼時候哪？倭個子感到不能沉默下去，也似乎想在他說話以後，可以壯壯自己的胆子。然而他聲音總免不了戰抖。</p>
<p>“快了，下山口還只半里路。”六順子比較是老練，但恐怖還一樣的。他們邊說着邊繼續他們的行程。</p>
<p>“呀，那來的燈火？”前面的人發現了這火光以後，馬上放下了自己的柴擔，停止了前進。</p>
<p>火光愈來愈近，他們失了主張，嚷的一聲，往東邊，誰也不顧誰的跑了，</p>
<p>早晨，一羣人在墳堆裏找着了小倭個子的屍身。不久又相繼的死了好幾個，以後只有六順子一個人給人家說鬼火的故事。</p>
<p>人烟漸漸兒的稠密起來，一批批的人從外面遷來。往山裏去打柴，從不敢等到夜深歸來。他們滿了一擔，坐在十地廟子前面吃饅頭；聽六順子講鬼火的故事。</p>
<p>一天劉成在山上吃醉了自己帶去的白亁酒，回來落在別人的後邊，一個人睡倒在山口外崗子上，可是沒有誰敢去探望一下，都在回想着鬼火害人的故事。他們想劉成也准是悶得鼻孔出血，臉孔發烏的死去。</p>
<p>第二天，劉成沒有死，而且是熟睡了一夜，當他說昨晚的事情時，院子裏擠滿了羣眾，都墊着脚伸出頭。</p>
<p>“我醉得泥人一樣，在我身旁全都是火光，但我沒有做缺德事，所以我能够很安祥。…………</p>
<p>他很有精神，也非常高興，當他說他沒有做過缺德事，顯得是格外有勁。</p>
<p>人烟更稠密了，誰都拿劉成做榜樣，當他們預備夜晚出去，都先審查有否做過缺德事，並且還盡量的吃足了老燒酒。據說酒可以鎮壓住鬼火。劉成仗着自己有這麼個經驗，搬到山口外，現在已經是很繁華的山外荘。</p>
<p>鬼火從此不再害人了。而且就一向絕了跡，只有老年人晒太陽時，講故事似的講給小孩子們聽。</p>

<h3>光明劇社的兩個喜劇「求婚」及「結婚」</h3>
<p>果戈里與柴霍甫兩人幽默比較</p>
<p>尼古拉九品官園莊上的活寳貝</p>
<p>賽過櫻桃園欽差大臣的姊妹篇</p>
<p>光明劇社自預備參加春季聯合公演後，就决定了二個劇本；到今年才確實都是俄國喜劇，一個爲被稱爲「俄國文學之父」的果戈理的「結婚」，一爲「短篇小説之王」柴霍甫的「求婚」；「求婚」爲柴霍甫的獨幕劇，曹靖華翻譯，收入在未名社叢書之一的戲劇集「蠢貨」里面。「求婚」爲柴霍甫著作中少見的一個喜劇，完全以他那種特有底小説風格爲基調，可以説是小説性的戲劇，他的一種所謂含淚的微笑，充滿着。這凡讀過柴氏小説的人，想都會承認的。而在這「求婚」里更加發揮出柴氏的幽默性來。</p>
<p>「結婚」係果戈理繼「欽差大臣」之作，耿濟之翻譯，連載於「譯文」上面，這劇本和「欽差大臣」雖爲同一情調，依仔細看過後，趣味却又兩樣，我們在這戲里處處可以看出輕鬆，决不像「欽差大臣」似的看了使人狂笑，但喜劇的效果是超乎其他一切劇作的。</p>
<p>現在把「求婚」和「結婚」放在一起，該是一個有趣的過程，可是這兩個劇本産生的時間恰相反的。「結婚」是反映十八世紀四十年代俄國官塲的醜態；「求婚」却反映着十八世紀九品官莊園的各種人情。固然同爲人生大事，但加以一番比較，定能看出果·柴二氏觀察社會不同的態度的。最使人滿意的，該是兩劇的翻譯，不但是直接由原文譯過來的，同時是皆由於兩位對俄國文字有很研究的耿濟之與曹靖華先生譯出的，所以文字不但是忠實而且非常優美，我們相信觀衆在看戲的時候，除去了領悟到二位原作者的工作之造意的好處，並且還會感到兩位譯者之譯文的優點的。</p>
<h3>危險的女性</h3>
<p>— 大上海映</p>
<h3>「生·死·戀」種種</h3>
<p>四十年代劇社改變作風</p>
<p>四十年代劇社此次參加聯合公演，係採用英國現代劇作家S·毛罕姆氏所著之「聖潔的犧牲」，劇情極爲迷離曲折，幕一啟即可引起觀衆之興觀，繼則如墮五里雲中，大有非至終塲不能離座之概。按此劇曾在紐約倫敦上演千次以上，在巴黎亦博得好評不少，而四十年代此次演出外國劇，尚係破題兒第一遭。</p>
<p>「聖潔犧牲」改名爲「生·死·戀」</p>
<p>四十年代演出委員會通過聘請孫師毅先生擔任此劇之導演，孫氏首肯以後，立即加緊工作，以旬日之時間加以改訂，並改名爲「生·死·戀」，因爲劇中對於此人生三大問題，頗有獨到之處，現經孫氏改訂以後，更可使我國觀衆感到最大之滿意也。</p>
<p>孫師毅談演出方法</p>
<p>有人詢問孫師毅氏，關於此劇之演出計劃及方法等，孫氏謂「目前决定採用寫實的演出方法，排劇最好將語言，動作，表情逐項分排，」日來各演員均在加緊排練中，日內即將舉行最後之總排練。</p>
<p>兩組輪演的新制</p>
<p>全劇分爲三幕，共須演九人，四十年代劇務部决以十八人演出此劇，分爲兩組，即每二人擔任一角，排演時十八人均需列席，據該社劇務部表示，此種辦法，並非預備性質，主要的是使社員多有做戲機會，且能在同一導演計劃之下，發揮不同的演技，作風，至於何人擔任何角，待日內各劇團聯合宣傳委員會作全盤之佈露。</p>
<p>李聲韻看外國雜誌忙</p>
<p>四十年代此次演出，服裝負責人改由李聲韻女士負責，女士日來忙於參考外國雜誌及奔走西服店，據云「生·死·戀」劇中情節係發生於歐戰後四五年間，男女晚禮服及常服，均需按當時式樣製作。</p>
<p>「生·死·戀」之佈景</p>
<p>「生·死·戀」之佈景，遠在半月前已有討論，現由趙明先生負責，並請張雲喬，許幸之，吳亞淸等諸先生顧問，聞佈景已大體决定，頗爲華麗。</p>
<p>各劇團聯合宣委會成立</p>
<p>各劇團聯合公演，以籌備會關於宣傳工作有統一起來之必要，遂成立聯合宣委會，由五劇團各派代表一人組織成之，負責此次一切宣傳事宜。</p>

<h3>Chairman Lin Travels to Hunan via Hubei</h3>
<p>Flags Hung in Wuhan's Three Towns to Welcome Him; He, Huang, and Others Boarded the Ship to Greet Him; Chairman Lin Addressed Party and Government Officials</p>
<p>[Hankou] Chairman Lin is traveling to Guangdong to pay respects to the martyrs of Huanghuagang and to inspect the construction of various provinces. On the morning of the 22nd, at 9:30 AM, he arrived in Wuchang aboard the Yong Sui warship. The three towns of Wuhan all raised flags in welcome. He Chengjun, Huang Shaohong, Peng Guojun, and Chen Panling boarded the ship to greet him and accompany him ashore. Garrison Commander Guo Chan, along with various department heads and heads of government agencies, lined up at the Hanyangmen wharf to respectfully welcome him. The police department's Chief of Staff Jin Jutang, Wuhan Police Bureau Chief Cai Mengjian, and Chen Xizeng directed the military police to maintain strict security. Chairman Lin, wearing a black overcoat and a blue robe as a waistcoat, disembarked amidst the sound of saluting cannons, firecrackers, and military music. He proceeded directly to the provincial party headquarters and then to the provincial government for inspection. In the afternoon, he visited Wuhan University on Luojia Mountain. He was scheduled to take a special Feng Han train south at 8:00 PM. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Hankou] At the provincial party headquarters, Chairman Lin addressed all staff members, generally encouraging them to delve deeply into the populace, pay attention to promoting local autonomy, and cooperate with administrative agencies. He stated that while the party headquarters and administrative agencies may differ in procedures, they are essentially the same in spirit. He expressed his hope that they would jointly lead the people to complete local autonomy. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Hankou] This newspaper's reporter paid a visit to Chairman Lin at the provincial party headquarters and was received with pleasure. Lin stated, "I am traveling to Guangdong to pay respects to the martyrs of Huanghuagang. After completing my official duties, I will return to the capital. I may pass through Hankou again on my return journey. I resided in Wuchang for a long time during the Wuchang Uprising of 1911. Even after Hanyang fell and Li Yuanhong fled to Hongshan, I did not leave. Today's new provincial party headquarters is the former military government. Revisiting this old place fills me with joy. Local construction has progressed rapidly, which shows the efforts of the authorities. I am particularly gratified." He also offered humble words of thanks for the hard work. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Hankou] On the afternoon of the 22nd, Chairman Lin inspected the provincial government and delivered a speech. He expressed satisfaction with the cleanliness and construction of the city, the joint office of the provincial government, and the neat uniforms of the civil servants. He continued, "In modern countries, everything must be scientific. All matters must be disciplined, orderly, and systematic in order to increase administrative efficiency." Finally, he encouraged civil servants to cherish their time and study academics, as well as cultivate their physical strength, in their spare time after their hard work, so as to be prepared for national service. At 3:00 PM, he visited Wuhan University. At 6:00 PM, he and Lu Chao and He Jian's representatives boarded a train at the new Binjiangmen Station to head south. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Xiang Hanping from the Fourth Route Army traveled to Shaozhou on the morning of the 23rd to await Chairman Lin. Lin is expected to arrive in the province on the evening of the 24th and has chosen a guesthouse as his headquarters. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Hankou] Chairman Lin, in order to preside over the memorial service for the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang in Guangdong, departed from Beijing on the morning of the 20th aboard the Yong Sui warship to travel to Hankou and then take the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou. Upon hearing the news, all circles in Wuhan made enthusiastic preparations for a welcome. At Hanyangmen in Wuchang and at the ferry terminal, they erected tall colorful arches with the words "Welcome Chairman Lin of the National Government." On the 22nd, all three towns of Wuhan raised flags. More than 1,000 heads of government agencies and leaders of people's organizations lined up at Hanyangmen in Wuchang at 7:00 AM on the 22nd to respectfully welcome him. Chairman Lin arrived in Hankou at 9:30 AM aboard the Yong Sui warship. Warships in the river fired saluting cannons to pay their respects. He Chengjun, Huang Shaoxiong, Peng Guojun, and Chen Panling boarded the ship to greet him. On the ship, Chairman Lin inquired in detail to He Chengjun about the situation of bandit suppression in Hubei Province. At 9:40 AM, he disembarked and went to the provincial party headquarters for inspection, received members of various party headquarters in Wuhan, and gave a speech to the staff, saying that they should strive to promote local autonomy in the future and that the work of the party headquarters should be promoted to the people. At 10:00 AM, he went to the provincial government for inspection and summoned all staff members to give a speech, encouraging them to be diligent and devoted to their duties and not to waste time. At 12:00 PM, the provincial government held a banquet. At 3:30 PM in the afternoon, he visited Luojia Mountain and Wuhan University. At 5:00 PM, He Chengjun held a banquet at the Wuhan University Guesthouse. At 6:30 PM, he left the mountain and took a special train at the Wuchang Main Station of the Yuehan Railway to head south. Hundreds of people, including He Chengjun, went to the station to see him off. The railway bureau sent Deputy Director of the General Affairs Department Qu Jia Ying to take care of him along the way. The reporter learned from Chairman Lin that his health was good and his spirits were high along the way. He also said that he had personally participated in the Wuhan Uprising in 1911 and had also come to Hubei once seventeen years ago. This time, revisiting the old place, he felt that all aspects of construction had progressed rapidly and he was very happy. It is currently undecided whether he will return to Beijing via the Yuehan Railway through Hunan and Hubei after paying respects to the Huanghuagang martyrs in Guangdong, or whether he will go to Guangxi. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Hankou] Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government, accompanied by more than 200 staff members, arrived in Hankou on the 22nd at 7:30 AM aboard the warship Yong Sui. He was grandly welcomed by all sectors of the party, government, military, and people, disembarked in Wuchang, and took a special train on the Yuehan Railway to head south. He is expected to arrive in Guangzhou on the 25th and is said to be planning to stay for a week and pay respects to the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang.

<h3>Japan Does Not Forget Its Acquired Interests in North China</h3>
<p>Kita Advises Against Hasty Action; Start with Economic Cooperation</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Yin Ni, along with Sun Rongbin, the puppet secretary director, and Zhang Jun, the puppet intelligence section chief, arrived in Tianjin from Tongzhou by car at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 22nd, and immediately went to the Hibiscus Villa to meet Kita. At 10:00 AM, they accompanied Kita to the Zhangyuan residence to meet Tadashi Hashimoto and held secret talks for two and a half hours before dispersing at noon. Tadashi hosted a banquet at his official residence for those who participated in the talks. Yin will stay in Tianjin for two days before returning to Tongzhou. Those familiar with the Japanese situation observe that Japan's policy towards North China is still to carve it out of the scope of Sino-Japanese diplomacy and handle it as a special region. However, in order to ease the emotions of the Chinese people, it is changing political issues into economic issues, but it is determined not to give up its acquired interests in North China. Kita's visit advocates temporarily trying to adjust national relations, economic cooperation, and diplomacy for four months. If profits can be found, even sacrificing the two puppet organizations in eastern Hebei and northern Chahar is not hesitated. If this path is not viable, then economic issues will be abandoned and the focus will be on promoting military diplomacy. Kita also firmly urged the military in this area to abide by this principle and wait quietly for the promotion of the aforementioned strategies. Before leaving China, he rushed back to Shanghai and reported to Kawagoe on the opinions he had gathered from various parties in North China for his reference upon returning to Japan.

<h3>Central Authority's Two Memorial Weeks</h3>
<p>Wang Discusses Economic Development and National Defense, Zhang Ji Discusses Eurasian Cultural Transportation</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Authority held its 68th Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the 22nd. Attendees included Central Committee members Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chujian, Ju Zheng, He Yingqin, Ma Chaojun, Wang Chonghui, Jiang Zuobin, Wang Boqun, Wang Yongbin, Liu Jiwen, Chen Bijun, Hong Lanyou, Zhou Qigang, Wang Maogong, Chen Shaokuan, Li Zonghuang, Wu Zhongxin, Li Jingzhai, Hong Ludong, Shao Hua, Di Ying, Wang Zizhuang, Gu Zhengding, Xu Enzeng, and all staff members, totaling approximately 700 people. Chairman Wang Zhaoming presided and, after performing the rituals, delivered a report, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>▲Impressions of Suiyuan: Comrades, Brothers, I was assigned by the Central Authority to go to Suiyuan to pay tribute to the fallen soldiers. On the afternoon of the 13th, I flew to Taiyuan. On the morning of the 15th, I flew with Comrade Yan Baichuan to Guisui to attend the memorial service. On the 16th, I attended the military parade. On the 17th, I attended the completion of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Affairs Committee and flew back to Taiyuan. On the 18th, I flew back to the capital. In this short period, I gained many impressions, but today I can only share some of them. First, the Shanxi and Suiyuan military and political authorities deeply understand the Central Authority's policy of national salvation and survival, and wholeheartedly and practically implement it. Second, people from all walks of life in Shanxi and Suiyuan understand the meaning of sincere unity to overcome national difficulties, support the Central Authority, and enthusiastically assist local authorities in their work, especially in mass training, which is taken very seriously. The military parade showed a tendency of unity, and ordinary people are also very enthusiastic about military training. Some have only been trained for a month or so, but they have already achieved excellent results in the march-past. Third, all military and political circles hold a firm and unwavering determination to defend the territory and resist aggression, but they are not complacent, without any pride or negligence. They usually deeply understand the meaning of national unity and shared weal and woe, and engage in preparations with a spirit of patience. Once something happens, they will stand at the forefront of national defense and never retreat a single step. Fourth, the princes and Mongolian compatriots in the Suiyuan-Mongolian border also deeply understand the righteousness, unite as one, and strive to resist foreign insults. There is no distinction between Han and Mongol, and there has been significant progress in political affairs and education. All of the above are extremely gratifying. However, Suiyuan Province is sparsely populated, and the local finances, social economy, and people's lives are all feeling hardship, which is extremely worrying. I hope everyone will always think of our compatriots standing at the forefront of national defense and work harder on economic development to improve the people's strength, which will also increase the strength of national defense. Speaking of which, Brother wants to describe the general opinions exchanged with comrades in Shanxi and Suiyuan.</p>
<p>▲Catching Up: If China wants to achieve national salvation and survival today, it must work hard to increase the strength of the people to increase the strength of the country. This is beyond doubt. Of course, when we are accumulating, we have not forgotten sacrifice. When sacrifice is needed, we will inevitably use all the accumulation for sacrifice to expand the impact of sacrifice. However, during the accumulation time, we can only do our best to increase the accumulation. Some people say that accumulation is too late today because our industries and economy are all lagging behind. Even if we accumulate, we cannot compete with advanced countries, so even accumulation will not help to avert the crisis. We really cannot say that these words are unreasonable, but this pessimism is futile. If we want to achieve national salvation and survival, we must abandon the idea of "it's too late" and, based on the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen of "catching up," engage vigorously. The meaning of "catching up" is profound, and Brother cannot speculate on it arbitrarily, but thinking from the obvious and shallow, if we follow the path that others have taken, then naturally we will never catch up. For example, if economic construction follows the path of capitalism, or the path of communism, or the path of fascism, then no matter what, we will always fall behind. On the contrary, now the world, no matter what kind of doctrine, after some experimentation, has found shortcomings and made revisions. If Soviet Russia did not have the New Economic Policy and the two Five-Year Plans, it would never have the success of today's economic construction. Therefore, some people say that the current situation in the Soviet Union is that communism has failed, but economic construction has succeeded. For example, capitalist countries are also working hard to correct shortcomings. No matter what kind of economic system, they are all striving to make it rational and socialized. This can be seen anytime and anywhere in the economic construction of Britain and the United States. Dr. Sun Yat-Sen saw through this trend decades ago. The Three Principles of the People have pointed out a broad road for China's economic construction. This road is the common trend of countries around the world today. The meaning of "catching up" may lie in this. In other words, if China's economic construction today follows the path that others have already taken, then it is too late. If we synthesize various theories and the practical experience of various countries, discard the shortcomings and take the advantages, determine the direction, and move forward, then it is "catching up." However, we must pay attention. If we want to achieve "catching up," economic construction must not be piecemeal, but must have a whole plan. It must not be trivial, but must think from the big picture. Only in this way can we achieve "catching up." Otherwise, we only care about "catching up," but we cannot "catch up." Even if the country is idle, it is a waste of time, not to mention that the country is now in such a crisis of survival, time is really not waiting for us.</p>
<p>▲Eradicating the Red Disaster: There are a few more words. When Brother was in Shanxi and Suiyuan, comrades paid great attention to China's policy of eradicating the Red Disaster and asked many questions. The words that Brother replied have been published in the newspaper. If the communists do not accept the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, then they can only tend to extinction. If they accept, then the road to self-salvation is not cut off. However, the so-called acceptance must be sincere. For example, the theory of class struggle is enough to dismantle the unity of the entire nation and is absolutely intolerable. However, if they superficially abandon the propaganda of class struggle, but actually mix into the masses to carry out their divisive role and promote the collapse of the unity of the entire nation, that is not sincerely accepting the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, but changing strategies to take advantage of the situation. Its viciousness is even more hateful than the clear propaganda of class struggle. In view of the various painful experiences in the past, we cannot but arouse the attention of the masses and monitor them with a very serious attitude in order to prevent them. The fundamental and positive prevention method is still the progress of economic construction. Because if economic construction progresses, the people's suffering can be relieved, production can be increased, distribution can be rationalized, and consumption power can be strengthened. The people have a way to survive in front of them, and they can walk away freely. Naturally, there is no danger of taking risks, and even if ambitious people want to advocate chaos, they will suffer from having nothing to rely on. What has been said above can prove that internal security and resistance to foreign aggression are one thing, not two things. Even if we only talk about resistance to foreign aggression, peacetime accumulation and final sacrifice are also one thing, not two things. When our comrades are in this time of national survival crisis, we can only recognize this direction and do our best to move forward, followed by death, and there is nothing else to say. This is the general opinion exchanged with comrades in Shanxi and Suiyuan this time. Finished. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>[Hong Kong] Hong Kong has held large-scale exercises unprecedented in the history of the territory for several days. Aircraft and troops from Singapore also participated in the exercises, which ended yesterday. Political and military forces landed at various locations and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the defending army, sometimes even clashing within the town. According to the latest communique, it seems that neither side won or lost, but the battle situation still needs to be analyzed in detail before the judges can decide the winner, which will take several days. Although the defensive lines of the defending army were breached several times, a certain communique stated that the attacking army's naval and air power was stronger than that of the defending army. The attacking army used all possible methods to test the strength of the defending army, and the results showed that the defending army was at least capable of self-defense.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Philippine Request for Early Independence</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Philippine Republic President Quezon has gone to the United States this time. In addition to discussing business issues with the Washington authorities, he has also raised the issue of the early independence of the Philippine Islands. Originally, according to the provisions of the Tydings-McDuffie Act, the Philippine Republic would not be fully independent until after 1945. Before 1945, although the Philippine Islands were ostensibly separated from the rule of the United States and became a republic, in reality, except for some unimportant internal affairs, the remaining powers such as national debt, currency system, diplomatic relations, immigration issues, constitutional amendments, and national defense were still exercised by the United States. This kind of formal independence is of course unacceptable to the freedom-loving people of the Philippines. Therefore, one year after the implementation of the Independence Act, President Quezon raised the issue of advancing the independence period in this conversation, changing it from 1945 to 1938 and 1939. According to foreign news reports, the U.S. government has agreed to consider it and plans to organize a committee of experts to study and amend the Philippine Independence Act. However, formal action will have to wait until the committee of experts submits a report to Congress. Therefore, in the near future, there will be no decision on the issue of advancing independence.</p>
<p>How the United States will decide on this issue in the future will of course depend on the results of the expert committee's research and the attitude of Congress. We cannot make any definitive predictions now. However, the general public opinion in the United States can be used as a reference for us to examine this issue. Americans have always been divided into two factions regarding the Philippine independence issue. One faction advocates not letting go, and the other faction supports independence. The divergence of opinions between these two factions can also reflect the turbulent situation of the United States' Far East policy. Most of those who advocate independence are people who support the United States' withdrawal from the Far Eastern stage. They believe that the economic interests of the United States in the Far East are not significant (especially referring to China), so why waste such huge expenses to maintain the strength of the navy and army? They also believe that if a war breaks out, the Philippines will be easily occupied by Japan. Therefore, they advocate withdrawing from China and abandoning the Philippine Islands, and using Hawaii as the first line of national defense. However, the other faction opposes the United States' withdrawal from China and abandonment of the Philippines from economic, political, and military perspectives. They even believe that political and military interests outweigh all economic interests, because under the advantage of politics, the economic forces can have the possibility of smooth development. The strength of this faction is of course greater than the former faction. For example, recently, Secretary of State Hull expressed the close attention of the United States to the Far Eastern issue. Hull said, "Throughout the year, the situation in the Far East has not been stable. The issue of protecting American citizens in China has always been of close concern to the State Department, and sometimes it has caused serious worries. The lives and property of American citizens and the peace and welfare of the Far Eastern countries are all of concern to the United States, which makes us pay close attention to any development in that area." (See the National News Agency telegram on the 19th).</p>
<p>According to the above, since the power of the faction that opposes the United States' withdrawal from the Far Eastern stage is very large, then the United States should not allow the Philippines to establish a republic and be fully independent in ten years. But in fact, why did the Washington authorities implement the Independence Act long ago and now allow the organization of an expert committee to consider the issue of advancing independence? In fact, there is another reason for this. Because in future international relations, the integration of national sentiments is very important. If the United States firmly opposes the independence of the Philippines, it will inevitably cause great resentment among the Filipinos. Therefore, in future wars, the people of the Philippine Islands will not only not help the United States in combat, but may instead throw themselves into the arms of the enemies of the United States. Conversely, if the United States allows the Philippines a certain degree of independence, then it can win the favor of the people of the Philippine Islands and make great efforts for the United States in future wars. Looking at the fact that after the implementation of the Philippine Independence Act, the United States sent General MacArthur to organize the Philippine Defense Force, these newly trained national defense forces will become powerful soldiers on the front lines of the United States in the Far East in a few years. This method of retreating to advance is the most ingenious method for modern imperialists to rule colonial peoples. Therefore, although the power of the faction that opposes the withdrawal from the Far Eastern stage within the United States is very large, it can still allow the Philippines a limited degree of independence. Last year, Britain's allowing Egypt to be independent was also an application of this principle. As for whether President Quezon's proposed request for early independence can be satisfactorily resolved, it also depends on whether the United States makes good use of this strategy of retreating to advance.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations Difficult to Adjust Under the Current Situation</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Believes That Kodama and Others' Trip Yielded No Results; Japan Plans to Promote Cultural Activities with China</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published an editorial on the 22nd entitled "Adjusting Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations," which stated that the results of the Japanese delegation's week-long visit to China can be summarized by the words of Mr. Miyazaki, President of Nisshin Spinning, who said, "Both China and Japan are voicing grievances, and there is no opportunity to negotiate economic cooperation." Furthermore, summarizing reports from various sources, the following three conclusions have been reached: ㊀ It is extremely difficult to adjust diplomatic relations in the short term, and there is no other way but to maintain the status quo; ㊁ Japan should always assist China in completing a modern nation; ㊂ Under the current situation of Sino-Japanese confrontation, economic cooperation is absolutely impossible, and Japan has no room for economic advancement other than North China. The reason for this is that when the delegation was in China, Chinese officials and civilians unanimously advocated the necessity of first resolving political issues, which led to the loss of the best opportunity. As a result, the atmosphere between China and Japan was unnecessarily suppressed, causing the Japanese side to lose hope of adjusting diplomatic relations and advocate maintaining the status quo. At the same time, Japan's concern for North China suddenly increased, leading to its view that "there is no economic advancement other than North China," and it considers maintaining the status quo as Japan's maximum concession. Concessions beyond this limit would only make the situation more complicated. As for the Ji-Dong issue, if it is cancelled, the Chinese people will inevitably take the opportunity to challenge Japanese interests, just as the Zhang Xueliang regime used the poisonous plan of overthrowing the South Manchuria Railway in the three northeastern provinces in the past. Japan is very afraid of the recurrence of such incidents. Furthermore, special trade in Ji-Dong should be negotiated separately from the regime issue. Japan has now recognized the necessity of political adjustment in North China, so China should approach Japan with greater enthusiasm and dispel its anxieties. It is a pity that China failed to take advantage of this opportunity this time, etc. (Kyodo News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Japanese House of Peers held a meeting today, and Sadajo Eguchi requested that in addition to the Boxer Indemnity used for repayment, the government should also use special funds from the national treasury to enable Japan's cultural undertakings in China to expand from purely specialized academic research to the study of the actual situation in China, and improve facilities to absorb Chinese students studying in Japan. Eguchi also requested the organization of a special committee directly under the government to promote cultural activities with China. Okada, the director of the Cultural Affairs Department for China of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, replied that Mr. Eguchi's opinions would be regarded as beneficial references and hoped that they would be implemented in the future with the power of new laws. The majority of the Japanese cultural undertaking fund for China comes from the Boxer Indemnity used for repayment. The total amount of its principal and interest was about 70 million yuan in the past, and 43 million yuan has now been paid. According to the restrictions of Japanese law, this fund is only stored by the Ministry of Finance in the form of domestic public bonds and deposits, and only its interest is used for cultural activities with China. Recently, the parliament passed an amendment to the law, stipulating that the fund will be used from April 1st to purchase Chinese national public bonds, invest in railways and mining, and other undertakings in North China. Therefore, the so-called cultural fund has been diverted to other purposes, and its goal has exceeded the scope of culture. It is extremely important to view this amendment in conjunction with the recent talks on concentrating Japanese economic activities in North China and the reluctance of Japanese financial groups to invest in North China.

<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Discusses Japanese-Russian Pending Issues</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Answers Questions from Assembly Members</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The House of Representatives held a general budget meeting on the morning of the 22nd, and Tomobu of the Seiyukai Party asked,</p>
<p>Is the fishing right of Japan when the Soviet Union refused to sign a new fisheries treaty, indeed a vested interest that can be resolutely asserted?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Sato replied,</p>
<p>The rights maintained since the Portsmouth Agreement will never be diminished.</p>
<p>Tomobu asked,</p>
<p>Does the so-called free fishing have the meaning of using force? In the event of an emergency, does the Foreign Minister have the determination?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Sato replied,</p>
<p>Even if the negotiations fail, efforts must be made to avoid the occurrence of major problems in diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>Tomobu asked,</p>
<p>The recent two fishing zone auctions have been very unfavorable to Japan. The Soviet Union's five-year plan is now proceeding in the direction of recovering Japanese rights. Therefore, I cannot believe that the fisheries treaty will proceed easily. In my opinion, this is the crisis that Prime Minister Hayashi referred to as being on the verge of eruption. Does the Foreign Minister have awareness of this?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Sato replied,</p>
<p>I have also not considered that the fisheries treaty will proceed smoothly. Therefore, I cannot but be aware that many difficulties will be encountered in the future, and I will deal with them with the best efforts at that time.</p>
<p>Tomobu asked,</p>
<p>Did former Foreign Minister Arita ever negotiate with the Soviet Union on the withdrawal of Soviet troops?</p>
<p>Vice-Minister Horiuchi replied,</p>
<p>During the Hirota Foreign Minister era, there were repeated requests for the Soviet Union to reflect on the phenomenon of border defense, and it was intended to practically stipulate this issue through a bilateral agreement. The Russian side should first express its sincerity, and then it would be possible.</p>
<p>Tomobu further questioned the issue of oil resources in North Sakhalin, and the Foreign Minister made a response to this.</p>
<p>Saburo Yatsukado (Seiyukai) raised a question regarding the entry of Japanese warships into the Soviet port (Pidro Vinroski).</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Sato replied,</p>
<p>Various problems are confused, so although full efforts must be made on the Soviet Union issue in the future, it cannot be stated that the relationship can be quickly improved.</p>
<p>Mr. Yatsukado continued to ask,</p>
<p>Can a treaty that has been rejected be reconstructed from a new starting point?</p>
<p>Vice-Minister Horiuchi replied,</p>
<p>Even if the content is the same in the future, it should become a newly established provision.</p>
<p>Mr. Yatsukado also inquired about the progress of the Soviet-Manchukuo border demarcation committee and requested an explanation. Vice-Minister Horiuchi replied,</p>
<p>Committees are established separately for handling border disputes and preventing the occurrence of border disputes. For the former, the Soviet side advocated establishing a committee to handle all border disputes, while the Japanese side advocated limiting it to the eastern border. The Soviet Union also agreed to this. For the latter, although the Soviet Union has agreed, there are still some unresolved cases to date, so it is hoped that the Soviet Union will adopt a sincere attitude.</p>
<p>Mr. Yatsukado also asked,</p>
<p>What places remain?</p>
<p>Vice-Minister Horiuchi replied,</p>
<p>One is regarding the composition of the committee. The Soviet Union wants to treat Japan and "Manchukuo" as one, while the Japanese side advocates that Japan, "Manchukuo," and the Soviet Union jointly organize it. The other is regarding the border line.</p>
<p>Next, Committee Chairman Oyama asked,</p>
<p>With the session approaching and the bills piling up, does the government intend to seek any methods? Prime Minister Hayashi replied,</p>
<p>I feel there is a need to find a way.</p>

<h3>Soviet Anti-Japanese Actions</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul-General Stationed in Vladivostok Summoned Back to Discuss Countermeasures</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to an official report received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 21st, Kozlovsky, the Minister of the Far East of the Soviet Union, notified the Japanese diplomatic missions in Russia that the Soviet government will not allow the Japanese merchant ship association in Vladivostok to conduct business this year. All matters concerning Japanese ships arriving at the port of Vladivostok will be handled by the Soviet Maritime General Agency. Each Japanese shipping company may send one representative and his secretary to Vladivostok to contact the Soviet agency on various matters. As a result, the business operations of the Japanese merchant ship association have been virtually suspended, and the affairs of Japanese ships cannot be fully implemented. The authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, due to the increasingly intense oppression of Japanese residents by the Soviet Union, decided to order Consul-General Sugishita stationed in Vladivostok to urgently return to the country to discuss follow-up measures. (Kyodo News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>⊙Chongjin　Consul-General Sugishita stationed in Vladivostok returned home aboard the Amakusa Maru and arrived in Chongjin. He briefly talked about Vladivostok recently as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Asgov, who once served as the First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Japan, has been appointed as the Plenipotentiary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Vladivostok. He has a great understanding of Japan and said that the merchant ship association, which became a problem last time, must be kept in existence and that he will make efforts to that end. In addition, he will do his best to protect Japanese residents and plans to clear away the dark clouds between Japan and the Soviet Union in the past and assist our side. Therefore, Vladivostok in the future should become brighter. As for the inspection of Japanese ships entering the port, it has also been very peaceful recently, etc. (Kyodo News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Britain and France Agree to Restore Belgian Neutral Status</h3>
<p>Support Belgium's Removal of Guarantor Obligations; The Issue is Complex and Not Easily Resolved Quickly</p>
<p>[Paris] According to informed sources, the British and French governments have agreed to issue a declaration in the near future to release Belgium from the guarantor obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaty and support Belgium's release from the obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant (which refers to Article 16 of the Covenant, which stipulates that when the League of Nations implements military sanctions, member states have the obligation to assist with military force and allow the troops of other member states to pass through). According to reports, the British government sent a document to France some time ago, explaining Britain's views. The French government sent a document to the British government yesterday, stating France's views. It is heard that the attitudes of Britain and France are completely integrated and seamless. Both sides advocate that the issue of Belgian neutrality should be resolved quickly through diplomatic channels before negotiations on the new Locarno Treaty are held, and especially as soon as possible before the by-election of members of the House of Representatives in the Belgian capital. There are now only some difficulties in the details, which will be resolved during the visit of King Leopold III of Belgium. It is generally believed that Britain advocates that the League of Nations adopt a resolution to release Belgium from the obligation of military sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, but the obligation of economic sanctions should still be fulfilled. In this regard, Belgium is willing to provide a promise that if foreign troops act in accordance with Article 16 of the Covenant to implement sanctions, Belgium should allow them to pass through Belgian territory, but Belgium's promise is subject to a condition, that is, the foreign troops passing through can only travel from one border of Belgium to another border, and cannot occupy Belgian territory or establish bases in Belgian territory. It is heard that Britain and France are still prepared to satisfy Belgium's claim, but one thing that is most difficult is that after German troops were stationed in the Rhineland region last March, Britain, France, and Belgium established a staff agreement stipulating that the three countries should cooperate militarily with each other. Now Belgium is unwilling to maintain this agreement, which is quite difficult for Britain and France to deal with. It is generally believed that the staff agreement between Britain, France, and Belgium will be declared invalid, and King Leopold III of Belgium will provide an informal guarantee, expressing Belgium's decision to continue to cooperate with Britain and France. Responsible parties expect that after King Leopold comes here for negotiations, an informal agreement can be established with the British government first, and after France participates, it will become a formal agreement. At the same time, Britain and France may first issue a public declaration to release Belgium from the obligations of the guarantor state and only be the guaranteed state. As for other issues, they will be thoroughly discussed later. The declaration will likely state that the new system regarding Belgian neutrality can be stated in the new Locarno Treaty in the future, because its intention is to prevent the negotiations of the new Locarno Treaty from being interrupted as a result, and to prevent this move from causing international tensions.

<p>[Paris] King Leopold III of Belgium is scheduled to go to London this day to conduct talks with the British authorities on the issue of Belgian neutrality. The newspapers here have commented on the King of Belgium's visit. "Le Petit Journal" stated, "The King of Belgium will not make any demands that would hinder the hope of establishing a future Western European Convention, because the country has always supported the principle of collective security, which is no different from Britain and France, and without the help of Britain and France, Belgium would have no collective security to speak of." The Figaro newspaper published a dispatch from a London correspondent stating, "Although the issue of Belgian neutrality is extremely complicated and not easily resolved quickly, the declaration of recognition of Belgian neutrality by Britain and France may be issued on Thursday of this week."

<h3>British-Italian Negotiations</h3>
<p>Secretly Conducted in Rome</p>

<h3>Policy Change in Austria, Anti-German Sentiment Intensifies</h3>
<p>Safeguarding National Independence, Leaning Towards Cooperation with Hungary and Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>⊙ Graz, Austria - Today, it was learned that authorities here searched the National Socialist Party's offices late last week, detaining thirty members. This action further confirms the strong anti-German sentiment in Austria. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding Austria's attitude towards Germany, the Vienna correspondent of the Morning Post recently stated that after the Austrian government dismissed the pro-German cabinet member, the Minister of Public Security, Stummer, yesterday, it would treat members of the National Socialist Party severely. "Austria was previously lukewarm to the Danube River region cooperation plan, but in recent months, Prime Minister Schuschnigg has realized that there is currently no real possibility of restoring the Habsburg dynasty. If the country wants to guarantee its independence, it must obtain new allies. Therefore, it is generally believed that the country is preparing to cooperate with Czechoslovakia and Hungary. In the past, Czechoslovakia and Hungary were ruled by Turkey and the Habsburg dynasty, and they struggled for centuries to break free from their shackles. Now, they are unwilling to be subjected to Germany's control again," he said. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Italian Navy Manoeuvres off the Coast of Libya</h3>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Leaves North Africa and Returns Home</p>
<p>⊙ Tripoli Port - Special dispatch from our correspondent: When Italian Prime Minister Mussolini came here a few days ago to preside over the opening ceremony of the coastal highway, most of the warships also gathered in this port. According to the scheduled plan, the First Fleet will conduct exercises along the coast of Libya, and the Third Fleet will conduct exercises between Syracuse and Augusta in Sicily, southern Italy. Because Mussolini decided to return to his country quickly, he sent many warships to station in the port of Syracuse when the Prime Minister crossed the sea, and the ships docked in the port of Tripoli suddenly attacked the Tyrrhenian coast of southeastern Italy. This exercise is personally commanded by Vice Admiral Cagni, Chief of the Naval Staff. In addition to the participation of the First and Second Fleets, the submarine fleet and the air force also joined. The First Fleet includes seven 10,000-ton cruisers, the Second Fleet includes six 10,000-ton cruisers, four destroyers, and many submarines. Regarding this exercise, naval staff officers recently told our correspondent that this action has no aggressive nature. The selection of the exercise location is based on two reasons: ㊀ The transportation line between mainland Italy and East African territories is vital to Italy's survival. ㊁ The coast of Sicily in southern Italy is the most vulnerable point in Italy's national defense. In addition, Italy also wants to build fortifications on the Italian island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean (a key point from the western Mediterranean to the east), because setting up defenses on the island is very appropriate, he said. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Rome] Mussolini did not wait for the Italian navy to complete its exercises in the Libyan sea, but suddenly took the cruiser "Pola" from Tripoli port last night and returned to his country quickly. It is estimated that he will land at Gaeta port in southern Italy today, and then take a car to Rome. It is rumored that the Prime Minister's move was due to the developments in the European situation in the past few days. Officials here have denied this. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding Mussolini's sudden return from North Africa, the Paris Noon Daily recently commented that the main reason for Mussolini's hasty return was the result of the evolution of the Austrian political situation, and the axis formed by Italy and Germany had encountered a crisis. "This axis was based on the current relationship between Germany and Austria, that is, based on Austria's obedience. However, the development of the Austrian political situation shows that the country has a tendency to rebel and does not want to rely on Italy and Germany to maintain its security," he said. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>[London] The Daily Telegraph recently published a message from its Rome correspondent, claiming that according to what was known in Rome last night, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is now planning to return to his country early without waiting for the country's navy to complete its exercises in the North African Libyan sea, so as to discuss the situation of the Spanish war with domestic army leaders. The Labor Party's newspaper, the Daily Herald, also stated that "The Italian Prime Minister's early return is nominally due to the strong winds and dust in Libya, which made it inconvenient to inspect, but in fact, the situation of the Spanish war must be related to the Italian Prime Minister's decision."

<h3>German Government Violates the Concordat</h3>
<p>Papal Encyclical Severely Condemns</p>
<p>[Berlin] Catholic churches here today recited a papal encyclical from Rome, stating that the National Socialist government has violated the previously established concordat and encouraged anti-Christian movements. After reciting the encyclical, Bishop Bresing announced the current tense situation and ordered the congregation to prepare for open national disputes. The papal encyclical accused the National Socialist government of misusing the concordat, evading the terms of the concordat, damaging the content of the concordat, and publicly violating the treaty. It also stated that the Pope will continue to deal with the exploitation of guaranteed rights with open or covert forces, and that the elevation of racial and national ideas above worldly values to the status of idols is a blasphemous act. It also condemned the inappropriateness of closing church schools, the lack of freedom of religious science, and the implied anti-Christian meaning of other courses. The Pope also stated that his only wish is that a true peace can be established between politics and religion. Finally, he said that if peace does not come, the Church will rise up and resist in the name of God to protect its rights, because God's arm has not been shortened even in this world. According to the Church's observations, the German government may revoke the previously signed concordat with the Pope in the future. (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<h3>German Government Issues Response</h3>
<p>[Berlin] After the Catholic churches here read the papal encyclical from Rome yesterday, accusing the National Socialist Party of violating the concordat and encouraging anti-Christian movements, the German government immediately responded. The People's Observer, authorized by the authorities, published an editorial today, saying that although the concordat was originally intended to be a permanent solution when it was established, it is naturally invalid if it endangers the existence of the country. Since the establishment of this concordat, I don't know how many millions of German Catholics have served the country without any conditions, but there are many senior and junior clergy who have never done this. They believe that their duty is to disrupt domestic peace, oppose the country and the National Socialist Party, and harm the country at home and abroad, he said.

<h3>Rebel Army Severely Defeated on the Guadalajara Front</h3>
<p>Two Divisions of Italian Soldiers Collapse, Morale in the Capital Greatly Stabilized</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid - General Miaja, the supreme commander of the government army in central Spain, issued an article today congratulating his troops on their victory in Brihuega. The article stated that the battle rendered two powerful divisions of Italian soldiers crippled. It also said, "Our army is now advancing on the road to victory. However, the brave and fearless spirit of the soldiers is not enough. It must be accompanied by discipline before victory can be guaranteed." General Miaja also claimed that this victory has greatly stabilized the morale in the capital. Because the capital is in a dangerous situation due to the public enemy, political differences have been reduced compared to before, and food distribution has also improved. At the same time, according to the government army, the government army continued to advance and captured several villages, several highlands, and a large number of war supplies. When inspecting the corpses on the battlefield, a major from the Italian Army Staff was found. (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid - The Defense Committee issued a communiqué in the evening, stating that on the Guadalajara front in northeastern Spain, the government army continued to advance victoriously and occupied the town of Cijorna, capturing sixty-one Italian soldiers. According to our correspondent Rolling, the government army on the Guadalajara front continued to advance victoriously today. In the morning, they first occupied the town of Barrilete Hida (15 kilometers north of the town of Brihuega), and in the afternoon, they attacked and captured the town of Gollocho (20 kilometers north of the town of Brihuega). The resistance of the National Army was very weak. As a result of today's battle, 74 Italian soldiers were captured. Corpses were strewn all over the battlefield, including an Italian staff officer from the National Army headquarters, and many soldiers who were not wearing the uniforms of foreign troops and the Italian regular army. In addition, the government army also took offensive actions in the area of Alunren City in the southeast of the capital, which was quite successful. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid - The newspapers here compared the defeat of the National Army on the Guadalajara front to the disastrous defeat of the Italian army in the Battle of Caporetto during the European War. The Reuters special correspondent inspected the Guadalajara front and believed that there were indeed some reasons to compare. It is said that he saw in Dorica the war supplies captured by the government army, including field guns, cars and trucks. He drove along the Zaragoza highway, passing through Trigueque, and saw backpacks, water bottles, hand grenades, guns, bullets, food and gasoline barrels scattered on both sides of the road. A government army officer interrogated several Italian prisoners and told the special correspondent that most of the Italian soldiers were civilians who could not withstand the severe cold on the Guadalajara front last week. The government army is both hardworking and has sophisticated military equipment. The victory of the government army this time is mostly due to the power of tanks. The government army's air force drove away enemy planes and used machine guns to eliminate many enemies. (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<h3>The Government Army Captures Gollocho, Spain</h3>
<p>Tanks Charge Unstoppably</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid - The government army on the Guadalajara front in the northeast of the capital continued to attack yesterday and immediately occupied the town of Gollocho. Regarding the details of the battle, it is reported that the National Army was stationed with heavy troops in the triangle formed by the three towns of Yera, Mazuecoso, and Gollocho. The government army divided its troops into three routes to attack these towns and used tanks to charge. As a result, the three towns were captured one by one. As a result of this battle, the government army's position has been advanced by five to seven kilometers. In addition, 60 Italian soldiers carrying weapons surrendered to the government army on the highway from the capital to Aragon. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Foreign Soldiers Account for 90% of the Spanish Rebel Army</h3>
<p>Some Have Not Been Fully Trained</p>
<p>⊙ Algeciras - A thousand fascist irregular soldiers left here today for Ceuta to replace the Moorish soldiers. It is said that these people claimed that they were unwilling to go to the front to fight because they had not received sufficient training, and they preferred to stay to defend Morocco. According to a National Army officer today, foreigners currently account for 90% of General Franco's troops. (Reuters Dispatch from Gan Er, 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Garrison in Oviedo, Northwest Spain, Is Heavily Fortified</h3>
<p>The Government Army Has Been Besieging for Several Days Without Success</p>
<p>⊙ Avila City - The city of Oviedo in the province of Asturias in the northwest has been besieged by the government army for many days and has not been captured. According to a report from our correspondent, the fighting there has now eased. The main reason why the government army stopped attacking is that the bad weather is not conducive to marching, but its ineffective combat is the main reason. It is reported that the government army originally assembled 35,000 soldiers on the front line there to carry out operations, all under the command of General Tomas, the commander of the front in the province of A. The military equipment they carried was extremely sharp, including 40 tanks, 200 cannons of various calibers, hundreds of mortars, thousands of machine guns, and a large number of hand grenades. However, after many days of fierce fighting, the losses were very large. General Tomas led the remnants and retreated from the front line yesterday, and a small number of sentries were left to guard the front line. Therefore, since yesterday, the two sides have only used artillery to bombard each other. General Aranda, the commander of the National Army in Oviedo, is still supervising the troops to build fortifications. The trenches and fortresses outside the city are like copper walls and iron walls, and there are also dugouts to hide from artillery fire. Even if the government army attacks again, it will be difficult to cross the thunder pool, he said. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Expansion of Automobile Industry Strike in the United States</h3>
<p>More Than Two Thousand Factories Prepare for a General Strike</p>
<p>⊙ Detroit - The crisis of a general strike in all automobile factories in the city, except for General Motors, has become increasingly urgent today. The strike committee of the United Automobile Workers Union has ordered 29 local unions to prepare for a general strike starting tomorrow. If the police authorities do not agree to stop forcing the workers who are staging sit-down strikes to leave the factory, the general strike will be implemented. The strike will include 2,000 factories. General Motors has been able to avoid the strike because it has established a contract with the United Automobile Workers Union. Ford Motor Company will also not be affected because it is not located in this city. It is expected that after the strike, there will be 150,000 pickets "defending" the factories to resist the police. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>

<h3>80,000 Acres of Salt Flats in Eastern Tianjin Were Sold Illegally by Traitors</h3>
<p>Yin Rugeng Interceded on Their Behalf, The Changlu Transport Office Is Dispatching Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate</p>
<p>Tianjin News, There are several pieces of deserted salt flats with a total area of 80,000 acres in the coastal area of Hangu and Xinhe in eastern Tianjin. Most of them belong to the Nantuo Land Company. Recently, through the contact of the traitor Yin Rugeng, they were resold to a certain party for more than 200,000 yuan. The seller's representative is the traitor Shao □□. All the conditions have been negotiated. After measurement, the transaction can be completed. The Changlu Salt Transport Office reported that the matter involves the illegal sale of the country, and specially sent personnel to the area to investigate the truth in order to verify and handle the matter. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The situation of the salt flats</p>
<p>The salt flats in the Changlu salt area are completely concentrated in the Hangu, Xinhe, and Denggu areas east of Tanggu. The land is along the coast, and the salt workers are lined up. Near Hangu, from Beitang to Yingcheng, there are several deserted salt flats, most of which belong to the Shao family. Each has its own boundaries. Some Shao family members and other landlords jointly form the Nantuo Land Company for management. During the Guangxu and Xuantong years of the Qing Dynasty, a large amount of salt was produced here. Later, due to the oversupply of salt in Hangu and other places, and the quality of the salt was better than that in this area, the salt affairs authorities, in order to prevent the salt workers from fighting each other to the death, ordered the beach to be sealed off and not allowed to produce new salt again. Since then, a piece of empty beach has been abandoned. Because the land is along the coast and the soil is saline, agriculture cannot be harvested. Only reeds are luxuriant and self-harvesting. At the end of each autumn, the beach households sell the leaves and sell them to survive the winter. This is the general situation of the abandoned beach.</p>
<p>Traitors sell illegally The traitor Shao □□ is also a member of the Shao family. Recently, he was used by others to sell all the abandoned beach to a certain party. According to the investigation, a certain party has coveted the salt flats there for a long time. After buying them, they can be used for two purposes: ㊀ to produce salt on the spot, ㊁ to harvest reeds to make paper. Dalian Dongyang Paper Industry Co., Ltd. has established a factory in Tianjin with a capital of 10 million yuan. The president of the company, Uchiyama Takashi, came to Tianjin from Dalian a few days ago to prepare. The products are all suitable for North China, mainly newspapers, Daolin paper, and Mao Bian paper. The factory site is located next to the Hai Guang Temple in Tianjin. It is scheduled to start manufacturing during the reed harvest period this year (around November). It is planned to produce 24 million pounds per year. The reeds produced by the abandoned beach every year are the main raw material for papermaking, which is sufficient for the Dongyang Paper Company's annual use.</p>
<p>Yin's maneuvering</p>
<p>Last summer, the traitor Shao □□ proposed to contact a certain party to sell illegally. Due to unfavorable conditions, it was once suspended. However, a certain party's intention to purchase has not diminished. Yin Rugeng, in view of the fact that Xinhe and Hangu are close to "Jidong", in order to ingratiate himself with a certain party, specially ran around for both parties. After repeated discussions, it was agreed that the price per acre would be 23.5 yuan. Recently, the consent of both parties was obtained. The traitor Shao □□ himself has recently sneaked from Hangu to Tianjin, hiding in a certain concession, and met with a certain party to make a final decision. Once a certain party sends personnel to measure the wasteland, a contract can be signed. It is also heard that the wasteland is close to the sea. Not only can it produce salt and harvest reeds to make paper, but it is also very profitable. It can also be used for fishing, building camps and stationing troops, and is a strategically useful terrain facing Dagu from a distance.</p>
<p>Investigation by the Transport Office</p>
<p>The Changlu Salt Transport Office reported that a certain party had previously demarcated four salt flats in Tanggu, surrounded by wooden stakes, and originally planned to offer prices to purchase from the beach households. However, because the beach households were unwilling to sell, they refused and stalemated for several months. A certain party was finally unable to get what he wanted and voluntarily removed the wooden stakes that had been occupied a few days ago, restoring the original state. This dispute has just been resolved, and now there is Shao's illegal sale of wasteland. The matter involves the illegal sale of land, and a special commissioner has been sent to the site to investigate the truth in order to verify and handle the matter. The beach households in the Hangu area are also afraid that if the wasteland is bought by a certain party, and once the salt ponds are opened and sold at low prices, they will not be able to resist, which is tantamount to putting them to death. In addition to uniting the powerful landlords in Yingcheng and Beitang to firmly oppose it, they also plan to request the authorities to issue an order to stop it. (20th)</p>
<h3>Rampant Outflow of Chaozhou-Meixian Copper Coins</h3>
<p>Copper Coin Prices Rise Daily; Millions Smuggled Out</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Copper coins, commonly used in the Chaozhou-Meixian market, are now gradually depleting. Transactions and change are becoming scarce everywhere. Last winter, one silver dollar could be exchanged for 360 coins. The price has been steadily rising, reaching 280 coins in February of this year, 250 in March, and currently only 220 coins per dollar in various inland counties due to a shortage of copper coins and the non-circulation of auxiliary currency notes (due to the impact of counterfeit notes by Japanese). However, unscrupulous merchants continue to smuggle them out in large quantities. The price in Hong Kong is 160 copper coins per Hong Kong dollar. Foreign firms value them by weight, with 140 coins exchanging for one Hong Kong dollar. Each Hong Kong dollar can be exchanged for 1.2 silver dollars in Shantou. Smuggling merchants can earn a net profit of five jiao (cents) of silver per dollar. The Chaozhou Customs Anti-Smuggling Department has recently been strictly investigating smuggled goods. All armed patrol teams are deployed along the coast. Starting this month, 40,000 copper coins have been seized (90,000 catties seized last month have already been sent to Shanghai). However, a large number have slipped through the net. The outflow of copper coins is like a river flowing downwards, unstoppable, as can be seen. It is heard that a certain country's electric vessel anchors at night near the outer sand and grass islands of Chenghai, specifically to transport copper coins and tungsten ore for export, to be used as raw materials for manufacturing military supplies in that country. Speaking solely of Chaozhou-Meixian, the outflow of copper coins has reached one million coins. The government's seizures are less than one-tenth of the total. On the evening of the 17th, the Shantou Anti-Smuggling Department also seized 600 copper coins on a boat near Niaoju Pan. The case has been reported to the provincial government for review and handling. According to investigations in Chaoan, after breaking up a large opium den some days ago, they also arrested eight or nine people for smuggling copper coins and tungsten ore, and have already sent them to Shantou for transfer to the province for punishment. In addition to intercepting imported opium and exported copper coins, the Customs also seized a batch of silver articles on the 18th belonging to more than ten jewelry merchants, including Xie Yisheng, who were colluding with the Taikoo Steam Navigation Company to smuggle them out. It is evident that unscrupulous merchants are not only smuggling copper coins but also secretly plundering and exporting all kinds of metal implements. Even amidst strict investigations, smuggling continues unabated, which is truly lamentable.</p>
<h3>Severe Spring Famine in Northern Anhui Counties</h3>
<p>Grain Prices Soar; Disaster Victims Lack Food; Refugees Fill Roads, Urgent Relief Needed</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Northern Anhui, located in the Huai River basin, has fertile soil and abundant agricultural production, and is known as a prosperous region. However, due to frequent disasters and repeated droughts and floods, rural areas have become desolate and people cannot make a living. Last spring there was a severe famine, and in the autumn there was a prolonged drought. The affected area covers nearly twenty counties. There was a poor harvest, and grain prices soared. People's livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult. In the famine-stricken areas, there are cries of sorrow everywhere, and deaths occur one after another. By the severe winter, people were suffering from hunger and cold. Many have taken to desperate measures. In remote rural areas, bandits are rampant. Murder and robbery occur everywhere. Crisis lurks everywhere, with hardly any safe haven. Now, in the spring, the misfortune has not subsided. Rural areas are barren, and farmers are displaced. The disaster is even more evident. The sale of farm cattle, which are being transported out of the area to Shanghai for slaughter, is proof of the bankruptcy of rural areas in northern Anhui counties. The disaster area has turned into a spring famine. According to investigations, the disaster is most severe in Su County, Mengcheng, Guoyang, Taihe, and Bo County, with Huoqiu, Fuyang, Linquan, Yingshang, Shou County, and Fengtai counties being the next most affected. In addition, the three counties of Fengyang, Huaiyuan, and Lingbi in the suburbs of Bengbu are also filled with refugees and desolation. Disaster victims are crying out, urgently awaiting relief. At this time, the spring famine is widespread, and people's wealth is exhausted, while grain prices are unusually high, the highest in decades. For example, high-quality wheat sells for 18.3 silver dollars per shi (a unit of dry measure), and soybeans also sell for over 14 silver dollars per shi. If this continues, people's food supply is threatened. In the disaster areas lacking food, poor people mostly eat bitter herbs, coarse bran, tree bark, and wheat sprouts as food to fill their stomachs. The severity of the disaster is almost comparable to last spring. Surviving inhabitants of northern Anhui consider Bengbu, which connects north and south, as a major market on the Huai River, with a large population and easier opportunities for begging. As a result, they are leaving their miserable and impoverished villages in droves and coming to Bengbu to escape the famine. The once-thriving town of Bengbu has become the end of the line for disaster victims. In the main streets and back alleys, one often sees gaunt and helpless disaster victims, supporting the old and carrying the young, begging from door to door, exposed to the wind and sleeping in the open, like a picture of refugees. The local beggar shelter is too small and limited by funds, and can only accommodate two or three hundred people, far from enough. People generally hope that philanthropists will provide spring relief to benefit the disaster victims. (21st)</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Nephew Murders Uncle, Commits Incest with Aunt</p>
<p>The county police bureau, based on a confidential report, stated that the bandit Chen Shaoxiang had killed his uncle, Zhao Xilin, and forcibly taken his aunt, Zhao Zhangshi, as his wife, and was now hiding in Shizhong Village in the fourth district. They dispatched a detective team to the Zhangjiangzha Police Substation, where they joined forces with the local police officers to secretly go to the village that night. In the house of a baojia (local security system) resident, they arrested the bandit and Zhao Zhangshi. During interrogation, they confessed that on the 20th day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar in the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933), they colluded with Chen Wanrong, Jiang Gou, Yang Xingchang, and others to lure their uncle Zhao Xilin to a wasteland north of a stove, where they killed him and threw the body into the sea. Also, on the 19th day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic (1936), they robbed the property of Gu Cuigen's family in Rixin Village in the first district. They were sent to the county for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Public Official Causes Trouble Watching a Play</p>
<p>The fire brigades in the urban and rural areas of this county, due to a lack of funds, specially requested and obtained approval from the county authorities to invite the Zhang Ji Grand Stage to perform Peking Opera at the Qunle Theater, starting on the 17th, with any surplus funds going to each branch. Because it was a public welfare matter, no complimentary tickets were issued. For several days, a man claiming to be Zhang Xuetao, a special agent of the Jiangsu Provincial Government from Pei County, accompanied by two assistants, Dong and Chen, requested free admission, which was denied. On the night of the 20th, a Saturday, the audience was particularly crowded. Shortly after the performance began, Zhang and his party, accompanied by a certain captain and soldiers, arrived again. The organizers, seeing the situation, allowed them in. The three of them each occupied a first-class seat, while the rest were seated in the back rows. Because the theater sold tickets with assigned seating, the three seats were soon purchased by other customers. The ushers requested Zhang and his party to give up the seats, offering to arrange three other seats near the original ones. Unexpectedly, Zhang and his party, without asking why, punched and beat the ushers, and directed those who appeared to be soldiers to assist in the violence. The order was disrupted in an instant. Yang Meilin, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and other on-site staff of the fire brigade tried their best to mediate, but were all beaten. It took half an hour to finally separate them. Yuan Kejian, a standing committee member of the county party branch, invited Zhang and his party to rest upstairs at the Meiyuan Restaurant outside. Unexpectedly, Zhang and his party, still enraged, went directly into the kitchen of the restaurant, grabbed two vegetable knives, and brandished them downstairs. Mei Laoer, a member of the fire brigade, stepped forward to dissuade them and had five fingers cut. The audience, fearing a major incident, swarmed forward to knock Zhang and his party down, and tied them up with ropes for fear they would commit further violence. Fang Shixu, the secretary of the county government, and Hu Jun, a judge, were also present watching the play and witnessed the whole thing. They took Zhang and his party to the county, and immediately opened a preliminary hearing, ordering them to be detained in the Public Security Bureau detention center. Another trial was scheduled for the afternoon of the 21st. People from all walks of life were outraged and jointly telegraphed the provincial authorities requesting a severe punishment.</p>

<h3>Dai Jitao Establishes an Agricultural Science University in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Located in Lü Port, Taihu, Wuxi</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Allocates Funds to Purchase One Thousand Acres of Land. A month ago, there were rumors that Northeastern University would relocate to the south, but in fact, it may be difficult to achieve because the relocation of Northeastern University would incur a loss of 500,000 yuan. It is now understood that the origin of Northeastern University's relocation to the south was actually a misunderstanding that Dai Taoji, Deputy Dean of the Examination Yuan, Niu Yongjian, and others initiated the establishment of an agricultural science university in Lü Port, Taihu, Wuxi. It is reported that the provincial government has allocated 10,000 yuan to purchase 1,000 acres of land in Wuxi. The area is surrounded by mountains and water, with the blue lake blending with the sky, and the seventy-two peaks appearing and disappearing, making it a scenic spot.</p>

<p>Mayor Wu Transferred to Be Chairman of Guangdong</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters and Other Organizations Send Telegrams to the Central Government to Retain Him</h3>
<p>Telegrams Sent to the Central Political Council and the Executive Yuan to Approve the Withdrawal of the Order to Transfer Him to Guangdong</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters and other organizations, upon learning that Mayor Wu will be transferred to the Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, sent telegrams to the Central Political Council and the Executive Yuan, requesting his retention. The original text of each telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>Municipal Party Headquarters: Yesterday's telegram to the Central Government said, "Respected Central Political Council and Executive Yuan, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng has been in office for six years, and his administration has been continuously improving. During the difficult and dangerous times, he has shown his ability to respond effectively, enabling party and government cooperation and unity from top to bottom, and construction has made progress. Public opinion has praised him. Suddenly, we heard that the Central Government intended to transfer him away from Shanghai to take charge of Guangdong's politics. The Central Government has its own considerations in assessing talent and assigning positions, but the local government cannot remain silent about a capable person being in power. We still hope that he will be retained to meet the expectations of the people. We are extremely grateful. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Kuomintang kowtows. Yang Yin.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Yesterday's special telegram to the Executive Yuan said, "Respected President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Mayor Tiecheng has been in Shanghai for six years, with grand plans and arduous reforms. Both officialdom and the public, both Chinese and foreigners, admire and trust him. Shanghai is the support of the capital and the center of finance and taxation. The importance of Fufeng and Fengyi in the Han Dynasty is not enough to describe its importance. Now there is news of his appointment to Guangdong. Although the South needs talent and is a service to the country, the unfinished facilities in Shanghai are worrying about being abandoned. Not daring to intrude, we respectfully request a delay in his transfer. We hope that you will consider and approve this request. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows. Ma.</p>
<p>Municipal Federation of Trade Unions: Yesterday's telegram to the Central Government said, "Respected Central Executive Committee and National Government, upon hearing the news that our city's Mayor Wu Tiecheng has been ordered to take charge of Guangdong's politics, we are extremely dismayed. When Mayor Wu took office, he immediately encountered the January 28th Incident. The city was in decline, and all industries were withered. In this difficult and dangerous situation, Mayor Wu worked hard to maintain stability, worked diligently to govern, and all new constructions were still gradually promoted. He also eliminated labor disputes, stabilized industry and commerce, implemented the New Life Movement, strictly enforced discipline, maintained public order, banned gambling and drugs, and made overall plans. The achievements of his administration have won the support of the people of Shanghai. Now, he is also advocating Shanghai's frugality in order to reform customs, eliminate superstitions, and establish the spirit of a modern country, which is especially praised by people from all walks of life. We were hoping to continue his leadership and achieve these goals when we suddenly heard about his transfer. We are reluctant to let him go. Therefore, we urgently submit this petition and humbly ask that the Central Government (Government) respect public opinion, approve the withdrawal of the order to transfer him to Guangdong, and find another capable person to take charge of Guangdong's politics. We anxiously await your order. The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions kowtows. And, it is understood that the National Postal Workers' Union and other trade unions will also send telegrams to the Central Government requesting the withdrawal of the order.</p>
<p>Municipal Farmers' Association: (Title omitted) The news that Mayor Tiecheng will succeed as Chairman of Guangdong Province has been reported, and the news has been received with extreme anxiety. Our city is the most prosperous in the country, with trade between China and foreign countries and the convergence of all parties. It is necessary to have a capable person in charge to cope with the situation. Since Mayor Wu Tiecheng took office, he has been deeply in line with public opinion. Not only are the citizens loving and supportive, but foreigners also praise him. We are hoping that he will show his strengths and seek welfare for the people of Shanghai. Why let him leave and lose the hearts of the people? We respectfully telegram to retain him and humbly ask for your approval. We anxiously await your response. The Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association kowtows. Yang Yin.</p>
<p>Municipal Education Association: (Title omitted) Having read the newspaper report that the Central Government intends to transfer Mayor Wu to Guangdong, we are extremely dismayed. Since Mayor Wu took charge of Shanghai, he has been actively promoting and planning all aspects of municipal administration, and his achievements are remarkable. He has especially put great effort into education. We telegram to retain him and sincerely ask him to continue to lead Shanghai and complete his grand plans. We are extremely grateful. The Shanghai Municipal Education Association kowtows. Yang Yin.</p>
<p>Municipal Federation: (Title and Seal) The news that Mayor Wu Tiecheng has been transferred to the Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government and will be announced by order immediately has been received with great anxiety. Since Mayor Tiecheng took charge of Shanghai, he has built a great Shanghai and prospered the city, and he has spared no effort in supporting industry and commerce. All the merchants and people in the city are deeply dependent on him. At this time when various undertakings are making rapid progress, it is even more necessary to have a capable person to plan, and he must not be allowed to leave. The Central Government certainly attaches importance to the politics of Guangdong and has given him an important task, but our city is the focus of attention at home and abroad and is also more important. Therefore, we sincerely request that he be retained and hope that you will respect public opinion and comfort the people of the city who are looking forward to it. The First and Second Special District Citizens' Federation of Shanghai kowtows. Yang Yin.</p>
<p>More Than 100 Associations: More than 100 trade associations in our city, including the salted fish industry, jointly telegrammed the Central Government yesterday, saying, "Respected National Government, we are surprised to read in the newspapers that our city's Mayor Wu Tiecheng will be transferred to Guangdong by order of the Central Government. Mayor Wu has been stationed in Shanghai for six years. The stability of the economy, the promotion of education, the prosperity of the city, the handling of diplomacy, the construction of a great Shanghai, and the restoration of industry and commerce have all depended on Mayor Wu's hard work and planning. We were hoping that it would take shape and progress step by step, continue the unfinished work of the Prime Minister, and follow the leader's intention to build, working diligently and being loved by the people. Especially during the January 28th Shanghai War, he was able to support the dangerous situation and turn danger into safety. He was also able to maintain public order, ban smoking and gambling, and make overall plans. His integrity and fairness have made the cowardly stand up and the wicked hide. All these things are due to Mayor Wu's leadership over the years. How can we bear to part with him when we hear about his transfer? We have always admired your kindness to the people and believe that you will be able to understand public opinion and follow public opinion to withdraw the order immediately. It will not only be the blessing of our business community. We anxiously await your order. Salted fish, fresh fish, ham, fishing boats, fruits, seafood, dried goods, preserved meat, noodle restaurants, flowers and trees, sand boats, sand and stones, fishing boats, sand transportation, Chinese and foreign groceries, Western clothing, cosmetics, bamboo industry, local wine, sauce wine, tea, paint industry, glass, Hongxiu oil factory industry, mechanized coal ball industry, underwear weaving industry, fruit transportation industry, medicine industry, timber industry, rayon industry, pawnshop industry, fresh pig slaughtering, fresh pig selling, silver building industry, Chinese candle industry, Chinese alkali industry, pickled vegetable industry, leather shoe nailing industry, radio industry, inland river shipping industry, wine and food industry, etc. 179 trade associations. Horse.</p>
<p>Middle School Federation: Respected President Jiang of the National Government's Executive Yuan, Shanghai's major newspapers reported that our city's Mayor Wu will be promoted to Chairman of Guangdong Province due to the death of Chairman Huang of the Guangdong Provincial Government. The country assesses talent and appoints officials, and the people are grateful. However, Mayor Wu has been in charge of Shanghai's politics for many years, and his achievements are well-known both in China and abroad. He should be retained in his position for a long time so that he can fully develop his grand plans. We ask that you allow him to stay in office and comfort the people. We humbly ask for your consideration. The Shanghai Municipal Middle School Federation kowtows. Yang Yin.</p>
<h3>Commander Yang Fetes Ambassador Xu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Welcome Meeting by Anhui Compatriots in Shanghai</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that Yang Hu, Garrison Commander of Shanghai and Songhu, hosted a banquet last night at 7 PM at the International Hotel for Xu Shiying, and invited Shangguan Yunxiang, Xiao Zhenying, Wang Pengsheng, Ma Zhanshan, Chuan Bingchang, Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, and others to accompany them. During the banquet, Commander Yang gave a welcome speech, saying, "Ambassador Xu, distinguished representatives, ladies, and gentlemen, today, because our respected senior Anhui figure, Ambassador Xu, has returned to China to report on his duties, the Anhui associations in Shanghai are holding this welcome meeting to express their respect for the Ambassador. We are deeply honored by the Ambassador's gracious presence. The Ambassador was sent as an envoy to the East last year when Sino-Japanese relations were at their most tense. The Ambassador accepted his mission at a time of national crisis and resolutely shouldered the heavy responsibility. Now, a year has passed, and the situation of Sino-Japanese relations before us is obviously very different from when the Ambassador first took office. Generally speaking, it has gradually shifted from impulsiveness to calmness. The neighboring country has shifted from military force to economics. We in China have shown an indomitable spirit through many facts. In this, the Ambassador has worked diligently for the country and has spent much effort to turn the nation's situation from danger to safety and the national spirit from weakness to strength. This is our primary reason for welcoming and paying tribute to the Ambassador for the sake of national security. Secondly, our Anhui seniors who bear the great expectations of the country are all 'old and ever vigorous.' Recently, there was a period of governance, and the 'fruit remains healthy.' There is Ambassador Xu. When the Ambassador was commissioned last year, diplomats and politicians alike felt that the Ambassador's responsibility was extremely arduous. However, the Ambassador resolutely accepted the mission and ultimately transformed the dangerous situation that hung by a thread invisibly. This could not have been done without 'supreme benevolence and virtue.' This is our second reason for welcoming Ambassador Xu for the honor of our Anhui compatriots. In short, the Ambassador is a pillar of the country and a model for Anhui. I cannot express even one ten-thousandth of the admiration in my heart. Finally, I wish the Ambassador boundless happiness and eternal prosperity for the country." Toasts were exchanged, and the guests departed joyfully at around 9 PM. A New Voice Agency report states that Ambassador Xu Shiying, the resident ambassador to Japan, is scheduled to take the through train to Ping tomorrow night at 12 o'clock to pay his respects to Duan Qirui. He will return south on the first of next month and then pass through Beijing again to meet with President Jiang and Foreign Minister Wang to ascertain their views. It may be possible to cancel his resignation, but this will depend on further meetings with President Jiang and Foreign Minister Wang. In addition to attending banquets hosted by Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu and members of the Japanese economic survey mission, Etsukichi Shoji, last night, Xu also attended a public banquet held by Anhui associations and other Anhui organizations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Public Banquet by Compatriots. The Anhui Shanghai Compatriots Association, Hui Ning Compatriots Association, Hui Ning Guild Hall, Luzhou Five Prefecture Compatriots Association, Anhui Huai River Advancement Association, Yingzhou Seven County Compatriots Association, Shanghai Anhui Mutual Aid Society, Xingjiang Dunzi Hall, Fulin Compatriots Association, Ningguo Compatriots Association, Nanling Compatriots Association, Jixi Compatriots Association, Wuyuan Compatriots Association, Shexian Compatriots Association, Xiuning Compatriots Association, Qimen Compatriots Association, Yixian Compatriots Association, Jingxian Compatriots Association, Taiping Compatriots Association, Taihe Compatriots Association, Hui Ning Elementary School, Anhui Middle School People's Elementary School, Huiling Middle School, and other organizations hosted a banquet at the Atlantic Restaurant yesterday at 7 PM to welcome Ambassador Xu. Xu Shiying, Huang Bodu, Yang Hu, Wang Jiyi, He Xiaohuan, Li Jianbai, Wang Zhaopeng, Cheng Haifeng, Wang Yucheng, Xu Bolong, Hu Puan, Li Zhengqiu, Lü Yin’nan, Huang Yuding, Yu Gumin and over a hundred other people attended. Yang Hu presided over the event.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech. During the banquet, Chairman Yang Hu gave a speech, saying, "Ambassador Xu, Secretary Huang, fellow compatriots, since Ambassador Xu was appointed to Japan last year, he has used his usual dedication to the country and society to work diligently for the nation, bringing Sino-Japanese relations closer. This is not only the glory of our country and nation but also the glory of our Anhui compatriots. This time, the Ambassador has returned to China to report on his duties, and our 24 Shanghai associations are holding this banquet to welcome him. I hope that the Ambassador will continue to uphold his original intention and win honor for the country. I offer a toast to the health and efforts of Ambassador Xu and Secretary Huang."</p>
<p>Mr. Xu's Response. Xu Shiying then responded, saying, "Chairman, fellow compatriots, I am unworthy of this welcoming banquet. I was ordered to serve as ambassador to Japan on March 6th of last year and returned to China on March 6th of this year. During this year, the relations between the two countries can be divided into four periods in my personal perception. From March to July of last year was a period of chaos. The Chengdu incident was a period of tension. The Xi'an Incident was a period of fear. Only after Chairman Jiang returned to Luoyang did the situation begin to improve, giving the Japanese government and public a new understanding. The progress of diplomacy depends entirely on the assistance and implementation of domestic policies. I believe that nothing in the world can be separated from justice and sincerity. Therefore, during my tenure, I have always handled diplomacy with justice and sincerity. Thanks to the government's wise guidance, I was able to avoid failure. The strength of Japan is also not accidental. The country always prioritizes the concentration of talent. If we want to make our country stronger, we should support our leader and strive to realize our established national policies." Subsequently, Wang Yucheng and others gave speeches, and the event concluded joyfully at around 9 PM.</p>

<p>Ministry Orders International Trade Officials to Handle, Industrial and Commercial Circles Prepare to Respond</p>
<p>In recent years, our country's special products have gradually attracted the attention of international figures, and there have been many requests for our special products. Last year, the Belgian Industrial School requested a large number of Chinese product samples from us to set up an exhibition room, which was deeply praised by people in that country. The United States has also recently requested items from us. According to a reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency, Oberlephorpe University in the United States recently built a large-scale Peace Memorial Hall and is simultaneously soliciting historical culture and special products from various countries for display. The school has specially established a Chinese Special Products Exhibition Room for our country to display various special products. The US side has consulted our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to transfer the request to the Ministry of Industry. The Ministry of Industry has instructed the International Trade Bureau to handle it. Chinese trade has always been prosperous, and the display of special products is extremely beneficial to the export of our country's products. After receiving the order, the International Trade Bureau has separately solicited from various manufacturers. Various national product manufacturers in this port, such as the Home Industry Cooperative, are preparing to send their products for display.</p>

<h3>Japanese Inspection Group Scheduled to Leave Shanghai This Morning</h3>

According to Araki, the leader of the group, speaking to a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao, he said that the group's visit to Shanghai was limited due to time constraints and only offered a superficial view, with limited gains. However, he hopes to establish close contact with the business community in your country so that trade between us can flourish and friendship can be maintained forever. The mountains and waters of Suzhou and Hangzhou have long been famous throughout the world, and the group was fortunate to appreciate the scenery while inspecting business, which was a great pleasure.</p>
<h3>Truth About Rōnin Smuggling and Assaulting Customs Officers, Ministry of Finance Sends Personnel to Shanghai for Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>Baron's Report to Be Drafted and Submitted to Authorities Today, Rōnin Continued to Provoke, Almost Leading to Another Conflict the Night Before Last, Thirteen Shanghai Customs Officers Departed North to Tianjin Yesterday for Smuggling Suppression</p>
<p>According to the Shenzhou News Agency, since the incident of Japanese and Korean rōnin smuggling copper coins for export and violently assaulting customs officers, these people are still preparing to continue their secret smuggling. Customs officers, in view of the seriousness of the situation, issued a declaration the other day. The Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance has sent personnel to Shanghai for thorough investigation. The future of this matter is now unfolding. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mereba Inquires About the Truth. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency made a special visit to Meredith, Commissioner of Customs, yesterday to inquire about the development of the incident on the morning of the 20th, when rōnin armed and smuggled copper coins and injured customs officers. According to him, the declaration of customs officers was only seen in the newspapers. He has not yet received the official report from Customs Commissioner Barron on the rōnin beating customs officers on Saturday and Sunday of last week, so he is unwilling to make any comments for the time being. Meredith then called Barron to inquire about everything. According to Barron on the phone, the report has not yet been drafted, but the facts are not as serious as rumored.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Sends Personnel to Shanghai for Thorough Investigation. Reliable sources also revealed that the Ministry of Finance Customs Administration, after learning of this matter, believed that smuggling was rampant in Shanghai, and that its nature was serious, even more so than in North China. It has sent personnel to Shanghai, who will conduct a thorough investigation with Meredith and others within days, and discuss measures to suppress it. Customs Commissioner Barron was originally scheduled to visit Meredith yesterday afternoon to make an oral report, but because Meredith called him first, he made a brief report on the phone. The report is now being drafted by Barron based on the report of Deputy Inspector Alexander, who witnessed the situation at the time. It should be completed today and submitted to Meredith for forwarding to the Ministry of Finance for review.</p>
<p>Rōnin Provocations Almost Leading to Another Conflict. Japanese and Korean rōnin smuggling copper coins has long become an open secret, and conflicts with customs officers have occurred from time to time. Ultimately, because the rōnin are numerous and rely on their numbers, and have people supporting them behind the scenes, the violent assault on the 20th was inevitable, not accidental. Although a very small portion was turned over under the mediation of the Japanese consulate last time, it was only allowed to be temporarily kept by customs in name. The Japanese consulate and the Taiyo Maru can take it back at any time. After the assault, the attitude of the Japanese and Korean rōnin became even more arrogant, so that the staff of the customs who went to work at the Huishan Wharf every night were constantly under threat and had no way to deal with it. It is said that the rōnin once provoked customs officers the night before last, and the customs officers were able to avoid a second conflict only by maintaining a tolerant attitude. However, if this continues without a comprehensive solution, the future is unimaginable.</p>
<p>Thirteen Customs Officers Went to North China Yesterday. Since smuggling is rampant again in the Yangtze River basin, the number of customs officers has been expanded from 300 to 360-70. At the same time, customs officers have also been stationed at major railway stations such as Beijing and Shanghai. During the period when smuggling was rampant in North China, fifty or sixty people were sent from Shanghai Customs. It is now learned that these customs officers are still insufficient, so Gu Renmin, Tang Guoliang, Li Kekuan, Lin Tang and other thirteen people were sent from Shanghai yesterday. Gu and others took the Shanghai-Ping through train north on the same day.</p>
<h3>Shangguan Yunxiang Returned to Shanghai Yesterday After Returning to China After Inspecting Military Affairs in Europe</h3>
<p>Said He Travelled Throughout Europe Inspecting for a Year, Will Go to Beijing in a Few Days to Meet with Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that General Shangguan Yunxiang, who was sent to Europe to inspect the military equipment of various countries, went abroad last year and has been gone for a year. Now that his mission has been completed, he returned to China last month and passed through Shanghai. At the invitation of Yu Hanmou, Pacification Commissioner of Guangdong Province, he went to Guangdong for sightseeing. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 10:30 AM from Hong Kong on the Dutch ship Zinigara. He is scheduled to go to Beijing in a few days to meet with Chairman Chiang to report. A Central News Agency reporter visited Shangguan at his private residence. According to him, the gains from this inspection are as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection Covered Europe. I was ordered by Chairman Chiang last year to go to Europe to inspect military affairs for reference. The original inspection period was six months. After arriving in Europe, because of the urgency of time, I could not go to all countries for inspection, so I requested an extension of six months. On this trip to Europe, I went to Germany, Italy, Britain, France, Czechoslovakia, and other countries. Except for the Soviet Union and the small countries of the Balkan Peninsula, I traveled almost all over Europe. I inspected in detail the military equipment of various countries and the current situation of heavy industry. I will release the gains from the inspection on the military side after meeting with Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>Germany and Italy Revere Leaders. Shangguan continued to talk about his impressions of this trip, saying that he found the inspections in Germany and Italy the most interesting. After Germany's defeat in World War I, the country was chaotic and the economy declined to the extreme. After sixteen years of struggle, it has now regained its former prestige in Europe. Examining Germany's recovery, the greatest reason for its rapid recovery is that the whole country can consistently support its leader, and ultimately rely on Hitler's leadership to achieve today's achievements. When I was in Germany, I asked my German friends whether the Germans sincerely supported Hitler. According to the answer, in the current environment in Germany, there must be a leader to lead the national people to struggle. The whole country's love and support for the leader is really enviable. Italy's international status is increasing day by day, also due to the support of the national people for the leader Mussolini. Therefore, if our country wants to revive the nation, we must also follow the determination of the German and Italian people to support their leaders.</p>

It is hoped that everyone will support and work together to achieve this great event.

<h3>Completion of River Dredging and Embankment Construction Project After Labor Service Implementation in This City</h3>
<p>Labor Service Association Scheduled to Conclude Next Month; Implementation of Labor Conscription Awaiting Municipal Government Decision</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Government of this city initiated winter labor service on December 19th of last year, the river dredging and embankment construction projects in various districts are nearing completion and are scheduled to conclude in early April. The labor conscription plan for this city will be implemented after a decision is made by the Municipal Government. The details of each aspect are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Labor Projects: After the Municipal Government followed the winter labor service regulations established by the Military Affairs Commission, it formulated a plan dividing the city into ten districts. It temporarily conscripted over 60,000 able-bodied men from within each district, commencing labor service on December 19th of last year. To date, the rivers that have been dredged and the embankments that have been constructed include: ㊀ Zhanghuabang and Shengjiabang in the Wusong District; ㊁ Yuanchang River, E'chanpu, and Qianjiabang in the Yinhang District; ㊂ Xietang in the Jiangwan District; ㊃ Yangshupu and the western section of Qiujiang in the Yinxiang District; ㊄ Mudugang and Qiujiang Taopu in the Zhenru District; ㊅ The southern section of the Shahe River and Shuangyanggang in the Pusong District; ㊆ Shang'aotang in the Caojing District; ㊇ The southern section of Huangtonggang, Qingpu Port, Xingang, and Dongtang Tutang in the Gaoqiao District; ㊈ Hutangbang, Xiantangbang, Zhuangshupu, and Hengbang in the Gaohang District; and ㊉ Zhujiagou and the Majiabang Dike in the 44th map of the Luhang District. A total of twenty-two locations.</p>
<p>Extension of Closing Date: The winter labor service project for river dredging and embankment construction was originally scheduled to be completed and closed by the end of March of this year. According to Mr. Hong Qi, the chief executive of the association, speaking to a reporter from Dagong News, the labor service in this city, which began successively in various districts in December of last year, was affected by the weather. The water pumped from the rivers and streams was replenished by rainfall, causing delays in the dredging work. It is currently estimated that the completed projects in various districts account for seventy to eighty percent of the total. The unfinished projects are still underway. Therefore, the original closing date at the end of this month will be extended to early next month to allow for completion.</p>
<p>Labor Conscription: Regarding "labor conscription," since the Executive Yuan issued a nationwide order, various provinces and cities have successively implemented it upon receiving the order and have achieved good results. However, this city has not yet carried it out. According to Chief Executive Hong, this service is broad in scope, permanent in nature, and includes road construction, construction, sanitation, and so on. Labor service, on the other hand, is limited to agricultural off-seasons and is temporary in nature. Therefore, the implementation of labor conscription in this city must await a decision from the Municipal Government before it can proceed.</p>

<h3>Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association Appeals Again for Pond Repair</h3>
<p>Du Yuesheng Expresses Grave Concern: Related to the Lives of 100,000 People</p>
<p>The Gaoqiao seawall has suffered from disrepair over the years, riddled with sores and holes. Since the beginning of spring, wind and rain have intensified the dangers. The narrowest point is only two chi (Chinese foot) of soil, and it is truly in imminent danger of collapse. Nearby residents are running around in fear, not knowing what tomorrow will bring. The Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association, recognizing that the seawall affects the safety of the entire district's population, and fearing the consequences of any accident, has, through its president Mr. Du Yuesheng, sent a letter to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, urgently requesting the allocation of funds for emergency repairs to alleviate the suffering and ensure the safety of the people. The original letter is reproduced below: To the esteemed Director Shen of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works: I am writing to you regarding the Gaoqiao seawall, which is located in a crucial area with swift currents. The embankment is also thin and has suffered from disrepair for many years, resulting in numerous holes and dangerous conditions. Last autumn, the tides flooded, and the residents were running around in fear, almost unable to protect themselves. Yuesheng witnessed this and was heartbroken, and he appealed to your bureau last September for urgent repairs. Half a year has passed since then, and the tides and rain have not ceased, exacerbating the dangers. Several dozen zhang (Chinese unit of length, about 3.3 meters) of the Longwangmiao, Shuitian Huangjiazhai, and Daijiazhai sections have collapsed, and seawater is almost connected to river water. The seawall, which is supposed to protect the lives of 100,000 people, is only two chi (Chinese foot) at its most dangerous point. With continuous spring rains, how can it withstand another onslaught? The yellow plum season is approaching, and residents who are not fish or shrimp are few. Therefore, they sigh and lament to each other, with no heart to farm. During the tides at midnight, they sit up anxiously waiting for dawn, and even the slightest breeze feels like needles piercing their skin. Their situation is pitiful, and their plight is lamentable. Moreover, the Gaoqiao seawall stretches for more than ten li (Chinese mile), and if anything happens, what will become of the lives of 100,000 people? I am compelled to write again, earnestly and respectfully, pleading with your bureau to recognize the urgency, carry out repairs as soon as possible, alleviate the suffering, and ensure the safety of the people. I am most grateful for your consideration. Respectfully, [Signature]</p>

<h3>Zhu Qinglan Cables Yesterday to Request Funds to Aid Disaster Areas in Henan</h3>
<p>One Corner (Chinese currency) Can Sustain Half a Month of Life</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the Relief Committee, and Lu Bohong, Mu Ouchu, etc., went to Henan to investigate the disaster in Henan. Except for Mr. Lu, who had other important matters, who returned to Shanghai yesterday, Mr. Zhu telegraphed the United Charity Relief Association yesterday to allocate funds for relief, saying (the above is omitted) Clever telegram reached Brother Bohong, who returned to Shanghai earlier. I understand that. Lan et al. arrived in Luoyang in the morning and went to Yichuan for inspection. In the evening, they returned to Luoyang to hold a meeting and jointly decided to organize the Western Henan Relief Committee. Commissioner Wang Ba, Bishop Guo Fangwu, and the Shanghai commissioner were appointed as standing committee members with full power to preside over the relief matters. Fair people from all counties are responsible for assisting in the relief. At seven o'clock in the morning, he went to Dengfeng, crossed Yanshi, crossed the Luoshui River, and crossed the Eling Ridge for a journey of 150 li. On the way, he saw tens of thousands of victims, supporting the old and carrying the young, kneeling and begging for relief. Most of them are gaunt and haggard, and it is unbearable to witness. The disaster in Dengfeng is particularly severe. The population is more than 230,000, more than 100,000 are without food, about 60,000 are semi-starved, and deaths from starvation are heard every day. The food of the victims, grass roots and bark, is exhausted. Many people who eat stone powder suffer from disease and die. It is a human hell. How can we bear to witness it? Lan et al. were all tragic. According to the survey, one jiao (Chinese currency) of relief food can be mixed with other things to eat, which can maintain half a month of life. It is best to raise and remit relief funds as soon as possible to carry out emergency relief as soon as possible. Brother Zhu Qinglan and Mu Xiangyue kowtow.</p>

<h3>Lu Dingkui and Others Propose Automatically Abolishing Extraterritoriality</h3>
<p>To Protect National Security, China Should Set a Deadline and Declare Abolition</p>
<p>Shens Times Agency reports that in the Xianfeng and Tongzhi years of the Qing Dynasty, China began to sign treaties and trade with various countries. At that time, because the Chinese people did not understand the foreign situation, they rashly allowed the treaty countries consular jurisdiction, resulting in huge mistakes and endless troubles for decades. Since the establishment of the National Government, it has been working hard to abolish consular jurisdiction. On the one hand, it has been actively completing various codes and establishing courts in various places, and on the other hand, the diplomatic authorities have been negotiating with various friendly countries. For example, the Sino-Polish Treaty of Commerce in the 18th year, the Sino-Greek Treaty of Commerce, the Sino-Mexican Treaty of Commerce, the Sino-Czech Treaty of Friendship and Commerce in the 19th year, and the later Sino-Turkish Treaty of Commerce, have all achieved the purpose of abolition. However, in the Sino-Belgian Treaty, the Sino-Italian Treaty, the Sino-Danish Treaty, and the Sino-Portuguese Treaty in the 17th year, although the text of the treaty contains clauses stipulating that the people of the two countries should be subject to the laws and courts of the contracting country, each country has separate annexes reserving the implementation of the clause, taking the 1922 Washington Treaty as the condition for the implementation of the condition of the abolition of all relevant countries. For several years, although the diplomatic authorities have repeatedly negotiated with major countries, they still hold a wait-and-see attitude, repeatedly shirking responsibility, and are unwilling to give up immediately, resulting in the abolition being far away. It is a major obstacle to China's legal rights, and its impact on the country and the nation is extremely significant. Lawyers in this city,</p>
<p>Lu Dingkui and others, in view of the urgency of the abolition of this system, especially suggested to the Shanghai Lawyers Association to request the government to invoke the precedents of the suspension of war debts to the United States by the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium, and declare that the reasons for not being able to continue to tolerate it, decide the date, and abolish it on its own. Their arguments are quite worthy of international public law, and the full text of the original proposal is recorded as follows: For the purpose of the proposal, I believe that the consular jurisdiction system damages the sovereignty of the country, hinders the unity of judicial power, and makes the people almost have no laws to protect foreigners who enjoy special rights. It has a great impact on the finance, military affairs, public security, and commerce of a country. The harm is unparalleled. It is comparable to territorial division. For decades, the country and the nation have suffered from its harm. It is difficult to describe in detail. At the beginning of the establishment of the National Government, it was based on</p>
<p>Equal Diplomacy. It once negotiated actively with countries that signed treaties to abolish the consular jurisdiction system. Although some friendly countries have already implemented abolition, all countries that claim to be first-class powerful countries, that is, those countries that have the deepest relationship with China, either are willing to give up, but are confused by the complaints of their expatriates, or they harbor more evil intentions and want to use this system to destroy the integrity of the country's power. They are all shirking responsibility and unwilling to implement it. Although some countries have signed abolition with attached conditions, after investigating the content of the treaty, they are all the same, and all other countries have added supervision. If the cancellation is cancelled, the country will also cancel it at the same time as the condition of its promise. Waiting for the date of its self-abolition is like waiting for the Yellow River to clear. If we investigate where they are, they only want to agree to cancel the agreement to implement their</p>
<p>Agreement Not to Cancel the original intention. If the country does not make great efforts to deal with this situation, it will not be able to achieve the goal of negotiation, and the harm that the country and the nation have suffered for decades will continue to evolve and never end. The country knows that the harm of this system is great, but it does not dare to abolish it on its own, because it believes that there is a restriction in the treaty. Without the consent of both parties, it should not act alone. Gu Yihui, a member, believes that it is not only that international public law has clear provisions that circumstances have changed and can be used as exceptions for a contracting country to abolish the obligations of the treaty on its own, but also that for ten years, the world's major powers have been responsible for the obligations of the treaty, and their nature is hundreds of times more important than this, and they often act on their own without asking for the consent of the countries concerned.</p>
<p>Declared Abolition, I don’t know how many times. To mention the most important ones, the debts owed by the Allied countries to the United States of America during the European War totaled about 200 million US dollars. After the war, the countries paid only a fraction, and by 1930, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Belgium successively notified the US government that they were unable to repay the debts and would stop paying them after that. Although the US government raised objections, they all ignored them. The Treaty of Paris stipulates that Germany should compensate the Allied countries for reparations. Because the Germans could not pay the full amount, they negotiated repeatedly.</p>
<p>Young Plan, finally there is only one promise to pay only one more time, but the result is that even this last installment, and Germany also refused to pay. The Treaty of Paris has detailed provisions regarding the restrictions on Germany's naval and army preparations and the non-garrisoning of the Rhine River region. However, the Germans openly expanded their military preparations and built warships on a large scale the year before, exceeding the restrictions of the treaty by several times. Last year, the German divisions marched into the Rhine River region while singing loudly. The Covenant of the League of Nations is a treaty jointly signed by most countries in the world to mutually guarantee security and maintain peace. However, on September 18, 1931, the Empire of Japan, a member of the League of Nations, destroyed the Covenant and sent troops to China. The remaining countries ignored the security provisions of the Covenant and did not follow the regulations to provide the invaded country with substantial assistance. The year before, Italy ignored the provisions of the Covenant and annexed the territory of another member country. Such things have happened repeatedly in the past few years, and all the major powers in the world have been involved. Since those powers themselves can abolish the obligations of the treaty at any time based on their own judgment, then our country can compare it with this treaty obligation of the powers. The importance of the Treaty of Paris (that is, the International Covenant) and the Allied War Debt Agreement is not the same. Of course, we can cite the precedents of the powers and declare its abolition on our own based on the principle of major changes in the situation. Members believe that the government should send a note to the countries that currently have consular jurisdiction, stating the reasons why China must immediately abolish this treaty.</p>
<p>Please agree to completely abolish it before a certain month and day. If no expression of agreement is obtained, then after the deadline, in order to protect its national security, the Chinese government has no choice but to declare its abolition on its own. Thereafter, regardless of nationality, expatriates, in China, whether on land or water, the Chinese government should actively exercise its judicial power. It only needs to be done in this simple way, and the negotiations that have not been resolved for decades can be effective at your fingertips, and only by using this method can we break the stalemate in which the powers shirk responsibility and make it difficult for China. Then, the consular jurisdiction system that has poisoned the country and society will have a day to be cleared. I believe that this association is located in an area where Chinese and foreigners gather, and we have witnessed the poisoning of this system most closely. For this reason, since the past ten years, we have repeatedly sent documents and memoranda to the government, petitioning for negotiations on abolition. Now that the country is in trouble and its demise is imminent, it is difficult to achieve rejuvenation without eliminating this system. Members are in danger and cannot remain silent. Therefore, I dare to contribute my humble opinions and propose to the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of this association to immediately send a telegram to the National Government and the Executive Yuan, requesting that it be adopted and implemented to protect the country's life. Is it appropriate? Please vote on it.

<h3>Young Daughter Bravely Alerts the Police, Three Thieves All Captured</h3>
<p>The home of Qi Houqing on Avenue Foch Robbed Yesterday Afternoon; Police Express Gratitude to Young Daughter for Reporting the Crime</p>
<p>At around 12:00 noon yesterday, a robbery occurred at No. 3, Lin Sheng Fang, No. 461 Avenue Foch in the French Concession. A total of three thieves, carrying two wooden imitation pistols, first robbed about 100 yuan in national currency and gold and silver ornaments on the second floor. Just as they were about to go up to the third floor to search for more loot, the 15-year-old daughter of the victim took the opportunity to escape and report the crime. The police immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to surround and arrest the thieves. The three thieves were all captured on the spot, with no one escaping. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Residence of an Actor: No. 3, Lane 461, Avenue Foch in the French Concession is a single three-story shikumen house rented by Qi Houxiang (37 years old), a Qingjiang person who is the leader of a Peking opera troupe. He has been renting it for five years at a monthly rent of 60 yuan. Because Qi's family has a large number of people, he has not sublet it to others. Houqing himself is currently leading the entire troupe of performers in various parts of Yunnan. It is reported that the performance has ended and he is on his way back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Sudden Appearance of Three Thieves: Yesterday at 12:30, just as Qi's family had finished their lunch and were sorting out miscellaneous items, three robbers suddenly broke in through the back door. Two of them spoke with a Jiangbei accent and wore blue cloth shirts and trousers. The other wore a Western-style overcoat. Two of the thieves were armed with pistols, and one of the thieves used the muzzle of his gun to point at the chest of Qi's wife, Deng (37 years old), and forbade her from making any noise. Then, they drove all eight men and women, young and old, in the house into a room on the first floor and began to search for loot.</p>
<p>Forced to Hand Over Keys: The three thieves first searched the first floor, robbing 71 yuan in national currency, a gold ring, and silver powder boxes, silk handkerchiefs, and other items, worth about 100 yuan in total. Seeing that there was nothing of value left, the thieves forced Deng to hand over the keys to the third-floor rooms and boxes. Ms. Deng refused slightly and was slapped several times by a thief. This was because Ms. Deng knew that there were a lot of clothes and ornaments stored on the third floor, and if the thieves went up to the third floor, the losses would be even greater.</p>
<p>Young Daughter Reports the Crime: Just as Ms. Deng was confronting the thieves, her 15-year-old daughter, Xiao Mao, took advantage of her mother and the thieves being distracted, and secretly went downstairs by herself and ran out of the back door. She happened to run into the bookkeeper who was collecting the rent, and together they ran to the Tongfu Road intersection to report to the patrol officer in charge of the traffic lights there. The patrol officer immediately reported to the Lujiawan French General Patrol Room by telephone.</p>
<p>Three Thieves Captured: The patrol leader immediately notified the special division to dispatch reserve team members and a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives, riding in three large patrol cars to the scene. Upon arriving at the destination, they first surrounded the front and back doors, and then stormed in. The three thieves did not resist and were all captured. Two wooden imitation pistols and all the stolen goods were found in one of the thief's hands and in the toilet downstairs. All were taken to the patrol room for investigation.</p>
<p>Police Express Gratitude: The French police authorities expressed great satisfaction with the handling of this case, and said that if all residents in the concession could have the spirit of this 15-year-old girl in bravely reporting the crime whenever they encounter a robbery and provide the police with supreme assistance, then not only would the police express their gratitude, but also the number of robbery cases in the concession would gradually decrease in the future.</p>

<p>Run by a Korean Elderly Woman; Buyers and Sellers All Arrested</p>
<p>Bai Jinwei from Hunan Province, had been operating a "Yanzi Nest" (opium den) at No. 3415, Yinhua Lane, Route Robert, Hongkou, allowing opium addicts to smoke drugs inside. The afternoon before yesterday, at 4:30 PM, his supply ran out. He then ordered his fellow townsman, a woman named Chen Li, to buy heroin worth 2.5 yuan. Unexpectedly, after Chen Li bought the heroin, she was spotted at the intersection of Hart Road by a local gangster from Anhui named Yang Guangyu. He stepped forward,</p>
<p>Attempting to Extort Money, intending to force her to hand over the heroin. She refused, and a dispute arose. Yang then reported to the Chinese police. Both Yang and Chen Li were taken to the Gordon Road Police Station. A packet of drugs was found during a search. After a detailed interrogation by Chinese Detective Zhu Mengwei, Chen Li admitted that she had purchased the drugs from a Korean woman at No. 15, Alley 57, Zhaojia Bridge, Hart Road, on the instructions of Bai Jinwei. Chinese and foreign detectives verified the confession and then, together with officials from the Japanese Consulate, proceeded to</p>
<p>Arrest the Korean Woman, Li Haizhu (aged 68), seizing five packets of heroin and over 180 yuan in legal currency. They then went to Yinhua Lane, Route Robert, and arrested Bai Jinwei. All were taken to the police station. The police chief ordered that Li Haizhu, along with the drugs, be handed over to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation.

Yang Guangyu was charged with attempted extortion under Article 346, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. The prosecutor presented the case and questioned Chen Li. She confessed that Bai Jinwei had been</p>
<p>Running the "Yanzi Nest" as a business. She said the drugs were purchased on Bai's behalf, and because she was poor, Bai gave her 2 jiao (cents) as compensation for each purchase for transportation expenses. Bai Jinwei denied the accusation, saying he had a feud with Chen Li's lover, Chen Guojun, and was being framed out of spite. He claimed that the "Yanzi Nest" was operated by Chen Guojun. Yang Guangyu claimed he had previously worked as a partner for a detective at the Putuo Road Police Station, and that he had learned that a Korean woman on Hart Road was</p>
<p>Illegally Selling Drugs. He said he had been waiting there, and yesterday he saw Chen Li buying heroin. He said he reported it to the Chinese police and did not attempt to extort money. The police lawyer, Li, then stated that Yang's confession was completely fabricated. The police had confirmed that Yang had not worked as a detective partner. Judge Huang verified the confession and ordered that the three defendants be remanded in custody pending further investigation. The case was adjourned to be heard again on the morning of the 31st of this month.</p>

<h3>Detailed Account of the Tragic Death of the Bodyguard of Bei Runsheng</h3>
<p>Attempting to Please Ends in Disaster; Temporary Anger Leads to Suicide</p>
<p>Li Jinlong, a Shandong native, 45 years old, the bodyguard employed by Bei Jiansheng, a wealthy merchant from Suzhou, at No. 5, Baoshan Lane, Route Belles, French Concession, suddenly shot himself in the head with his pistol in the garden of the Bei residence the day before yesterday at noon. The bullet penetrated his brain. After being discovered, the French police were notified. He was taken to the hospital by car, but due to the severity of the injury, he died. His body was sent to the morgue for examination. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, here is a supplementary account of Li's</p>
<p>Reasons for Suicide. Li was initially recommended by Li Yipeng, an official of the French Municipal Council, to Bei Runsheng and worked as a "Sigao Pu" (guard) in Baoshan Lane. Because Li was straightforward and loyal to his duties, he was deeply valued by his employer and was promoted to the position of bodyguard. He has served for over ten years. His salary has now increased to 38 yuan per month. Li has a wife, Zhang, who is the same age and from the same hometown. They have a son named Genrong, who is seven years old this year. Because they live frugally,</p>
<p>They Save Every Month. They have accumulated 1,600 yuan, which is deposited with the employer to earn interest. He originally lived in the residence, and his wife and children rented a place at No. 38, Daode Lane, Route Belles. Li always kept the deposit book with him. The misfortune began one evening in March of last year when Bei's second son and his wife went to the Dongfang Hotel to listen to storytelling, traveling by car. Li was ordered to follow and protect them. At that time, Li</p>
<p>Was Very Attentive, trying to please his employer by opening the car door. Unexpectedly, Li was careless and accidentally stepped on the young mistress's foot. The young mistress was in great pain and scolded him loudly. Li failed to please, received a mistake, and was reprimanded. He was still disgruntled and still followed the car home. Later, Bei's son and daughter-in-law complained to their mother, intending to dismiss Li. However, Bei's wife said that Li had been employed for more than ten years and had not made any major mistakes. If he was dismissed and went outside, she feared</p>
<p>Accidents Might Happen. Therefore, she did not agree to their request and continued to employ him as usual. But from then on, the employer gradually became cold towards Li, calling the other two bodyguards to follow him when he went out. This has been going on for a year. Li believed that his colleagues had been gossiping about him in front of his employer, causing him to be treated coldly. Therefore, for the past year, he had often been depressed and regretted it. On the 21st, at 11:00 AM, Li was in low spirits. He "learned that his beloved son had gone out to play and got lost, and his wife went to look for him."</p>
<p>Further Stimulated. He suddenly had thoughts of suicide. He first threw the pet parrot that he had been eating to the ground and stomped it to death. At that time, his wife had found his son and returned home. When Li saw his wife and son returning, he took out the deposit book from his body, threw it on the table, and said to his wife and son, "This is for you to live on." Then, he turned around and went outside. His wife and son feared that something would happen, so they followed Li to the gate of the Bei residence. Li said to his wife,</p>
<p>"Go Find the Master and talk to him," and went straight inside. At this time, Li went to Bei's garden and committed suicide. His wife waited at the gate for a long time and ordered her son to go inside with another child to look for him. Then, they found Li lying in the garden on the grass after shooting himself. Bei's residence immediately called the police station by phone and sent him to the hospital by car, but he died before he could be rescued. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the police reported to the</p>
<p>Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang and a forensic doctor arrived to verify that the deceased, Li Jinlong, died from a gunshot wound. After questioning his wife, he ordered that the body be handed over to his wife for burial. It is reported that the employer, Bei Runsheng, gave 600 yuan in compensation. However, the family is still seeking more. The body was placed in a coffin and stored in Hall C yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Diplomat Seeks Mediation for Divorce, Agreement Claimed Valid</h3>
<p>Zhou Jingwan Intends to Deny Validity; Wang Gongxing's Request Denied; Consul's Wife Extremely Fashionable</p>
<p>Wang Gongxing, a native of Fenghua and Vice-Consul at the Chinese Consulate in Chicago, 29 years old, residing at No. 42, Model Village, Fuxu Road, married Zhou Jingwan (25 years old), a woman from Cixi, Ningbo, five years ago. They had a son who is now two years old. After Wang was appointed as Consul, Zhou followed him to the post. However, last year, due to disagreements, they signed a divorce agreement in English in Chicago on July 29, declaring their separation. At that time, Wang immediately complied with the agreement and gave Zhou $280 USD as travel expenses to return to China. Since then, they have gone their separate ways. After returning to China, Zhou resided at No. 31, Gongyi Lane, North Sichuan Road. Recently, Zhou expressed her intention to deny the validity of the divorce agreement. Wang then hired lawyer Wu Kaisheng to file a petition with the Mediation Office of the First Special District Court, seeking mediation to confirm the validity of the divorce agreement. The case was opened yesterday afternoon in the Eleventh Civil Court of the First Special Court. Zhou Jingwan also arrived in court with a lawyer. Zhou was wearing a dark-colored velvet cheongsam, a yellow wool short overcoat with purple and yellow trim, and dark yellow leather shoes. Her hair was permed, displaying the ultimate in fashion. When the trial opened, Zhou's lawyer stated that Wang and Zhou's marriage was during their student days. Later, Wang took office as the Consul in Chicago and had extensive social engagements. He then considered Zhou not to be his ideal wife, which led to disputes. One day, Zhou drank too much. Therefore, whether she signed the agreement is unknown. Moreover, Zhou has now moved to No. 24, Alley 468, Xiafei Road, so there are jurisdictional issues. However, lawyer Wu stated that Zhou did sign the agreement and that there were witnesses to prove it. The court then called Zhou to the case. Zhou stated that Wang Gongxing did not want to divorce her because his mother forced him to do so. Now, she expresses her unwillingness to divorce. Because Zhou was unwilling to divorce, the court ruled that the mediation was unsuccessful.</p>

<h3>Jinxin Silk Weaving Factory Labor Dispute Expected to Be Resolved</h3>
<p>The Jinxin Silk Weaving Factory at No. 36, Longren Lane, Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, has been in operation for eight years. The factory employs more than 150 male and female workers. Normally, labor and management are quite harmonious. The wage rates set by the factory are generally better than those of other factories. At the beginning of the silk weaving industry labor unrest, the factory management informed the workers in advance that if other factories improved their treatment, the factory would follow suit. They asked the workers to work quietly. Unexpectedly, on the 16th of this month, all the workers of the factory suddenly went on strike spontaneously. At that time, the management immediately submitted a request for assistance to the municipal party and government agencies. The agencies immediately sent people to persuade them and issued a notice ordering the workers to resume work first and wait for mediation. However, the workers refused to accept this. As of yesterday, the factory issued a final notice, still strongly urging them to resume work immediately. All conditions can be resolved in the long term. It is reported that most of the workers deeply understand the factory's hardship and have expressed their intention to resume work immediately. The original text of the factory's notice is transcribed below: "Notice: This time, the workers demanded improved treatment. While the factory gathered representatives for negotiations, the workers declared a strike. The factory submitted a filing to the party and government agencies, and the party and government agencies ordered them to resume work first to prevent reactionary elements from inciting unrest. All workers in Shanghai complied with the government order and resumed work. However, the workers of this factory refused to comply. The party and government agencies, out of consideration for the ignorance of the workers, sent people to persuade them, but they ignored them. This kind of behavior clearly shows that there are bad elements inciting unrest, expanding the labor unrest, disrupting social order, and endangering business. For the sake of the livelihood of the majority of workers and social order, the factory has decided to resume work tomorrow (the 23rd) at 7:00 AM. All conditions are negotiable. If they are still misguided and willing to be used by bad elements, the factory, in addition to requesting the party and government agencies to take legal action, will take effective measures to avoid prolonging the labor unrest and to maintain social order. This notice is hereby given. Hope everyone pays attention to it."</p>

<p>Admonishing Car Owners and Drivers to Limit Weight and Speed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry, recently seeing that fish vendors' vehicles often cause accidents and losses on the way, not only are the fish goods lost in large quantities, but also lives are injured and killed, which is pitiful. Therefore, at the beginning of this month, it specially convened car owners and drivers of the trucks to discuss preventive measures. Yesterday, the market received a letter from the Freight Car Industry Association to discuss transportation safety measures. The reasons for previous accidents were nothing more than: ㊀ Vehicle speed is too high; ㊁ The guardrail is not solid and there are too many fish vendors riding; ㊂ Police officers in uniform arbitrarily order the vehicle to stop and hitch a ride. Regarding the first point, the association has notified car companies throughout the city to warn drivers that the speed of fish vendors' trucks must not exceed 20 miles per hour, and please ask the fish market to earnestly inform them. Regarding the second point, the association has also notified the industry that fish vendors' trucks should be equipped with sturdy guardrails and limit the number of fish vendors carried per vehicle to no more than 20 people.

<h3>Bodhi Society Requests Protection of Temples, Pagodas, and Buddha Statues</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bodhi Society telegraphed the Military Commission yesterday, requesting that it order the national army to do everything possible to protect temples, pagodas, and Buddha statues. The original telegram stated: "To the Nanjing Military Commission, We believe that Buddhist philosophy is vast and profound, surpassing everything else. Even its images, religious objects, culture, and art have unparalleled value. Therefore, in recent years, European and American scholars have come to China to study Buddhism and investigate religious affairs in an endless stream. Seeing its precise instruments and rich scriptures, they deeply praised it as the glory of our country. Therefore, the temples, pagodas, images, paintings, books, and religious objects of Buddhism should be protected with all efforts, which goes without saying. Recently, it was seen in the newspaper that the army in the border area destroyed Buddha statues in a certain Lama temple. We believe that the people of Mongolia and Tibet mostly believe in Buddhism and value Buddha statues more than life. If they are destroyed, not only will the local people deeply hate it, but also worry that strong neighbors will use it as an excuse to incite unrest, turning the unreclaimed land into an ally of the enemy, and the surrounding areas may harbor rebellious intentions, which will be detrimental to military and political affairs. Although what is reported in the newspapers may not be entirely true, we must prevent it in advance. We intend to request your commission to order the national army that wherever they are stationed or pass through, they should do everything possible to protect temples, pagodas, Buddha statues, scriptures, religious objects, murals, inscriptions, and carvings, and not destroy them. This will greatly benefit the overall plan of the country and cultural arts, and it will not only be the fortune of Buddhism. We respectfully submit this telegram, and we respectfully ask you to examine and instruct us to comply. The President of the Bodhi Society, the Panchen Lama; Vice President, Shi Yinguang; Chairman, Wang Yiting; together bowed."</p>

<h3>The Thief Who Stole Electrical Wires Walks Right into the Trap</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon at approximately 3 PM, a man named Xu Ajin, 29 years old, from Nanxiang, whose head, face, limbs, waist, and back were severely injured, arrived at the Xin Zha Police Station in Zhabei by rickshaw. He claimed that he had been brutally beaten by his enemies surnamed Liu and others near Xiaoyang Bridge on Jiaotong Road, and suffered severe injuries, especially to his face, which he said had been slashed with a sharp axe. However, examining the wounds, they did not appear to be axe wounds. Therefore, the police station immediately summoned Wu Songshan, a detective from the sixth squad of the Detective Team, to the station. Wu took Xu into custody for questioning, while also sending him to the nearby Pushan Hospital for treatment. Xu Ajin then confessed that he had been injured while stealing electrical wires, causing the wooden pole to fall on him. He claimed that in February of last year, he and accomplices, including Wang Amao from Ningbo, were caught stealing electrical wires in Xujiawan by the local defense corps and sent to the police station, then transferred to the Shanghai Local Court. Wang Amao was sentenced to one year and six months, and he (Xu Ajin) claimed to have been sentenced to six months, only being released on January 1st of this year. Since his release, he had stolen wires three times. The first time, he stole several bundles in Zhenru, selling them for $9.40. The second time, he sold them for $10.30, both times at the Deda Old Copper and Tin Shop at No. 30 Houma Road in Caojiadu. The third time was on the night of the 19th of this month, when he was cutting wires near the western end of Xiaoyang Bridge on Jiaotong Road. Just as he was cutting the fourth wire, a strong wind and heavy rain caused the wooden pole to fall, injuring his waist and back. His face was injured by the severed electrical wire. Because of the severity of his injuries, he could not go to the hospital for treatment, as hospitals require all injured people to be reported to the police. So he went to the police station and falsely claimed he had been beaten. Yesterday afternoon, the team sent leader Liu Bingyuan and detective Wu Songshan to No. 30 Houma Road in Caojiadu to summon Pan Wengao, the owner of the Deda Copper and Tin Shop, for questioning.</p>

During the fire, an apprentice named Gu Benjun, 19 years old, from Zhenjiang, was unable to escape and perished in the flames. The Fire Brigade arrived and extinguished the fire, and retrieved Gu's body, reporting it to the Lao Zha Police Station, which ordered an investigation. The body was taken to the Philand Road morgue. It was reported yesterday that the First Special District Local Court dispatched prosecutor Zhang Zongru to the morgue to examine the body. Wang Shouquan, 40 years old, from Jiangdu, who works as an accountant at the pharmacy, testified that the fire broke out suddenly and the cause was unknown. Three other people were also burned in the fire and are currently being treated at Renji Hospital. Gu Jingxian testified that he resided in Zhenjiang and that the deceased was his son, and requested to claim the body. Zhang ruled that the deceased, Gu Benjun, was male and had died from burns sustained before death. The body was released to his father, Gu Jingxian, after signing a receipt.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>We respectfully write to you: We are extremely grateful for your newspaper's coverage of our association's celebration of the March 17th National Physicians' Day held at the Hu She. However, the item regarding the fundraising for the construction of the Central National Medical Hall is a mistaken rumor. The Capital National Hospital was initiated by Jiao Yitang, Director of the Central National Medical Hall, along with President Sun Zhesheng, President Yu Youren, and Vice-Chairman Feng Huanzhang, who deeply believe that the National Hospital meets the needs of the public and is still an innovation in our country. This matter is not only for improving the therapeutic skills of Chinese medicine but also for setting an example for all regions. Therefore, we intend to make the equipment as perfect as possible. In addition to President Sun Zhesheng and others submitting a proposal to the Central Political Conference to allocate 150,000 yuan for construction expenses, Director Jiao also transferred 30,000 yuan from the Central National Medical Hall's annual savings expenses to be used for the construction of the Capital National Hospital. The facts are as such. Director Jiao and others' move is to seek to promote the fundamental academic position of Chinese medicine throughout China, and everyone should have the obligation to contribute. The purpose of our association's celebration is to reflect this, so we are writing specifically to correct this and hope that it can be disclosed to show the true situation. We eagerly anticipate this and wish you all the best. Respectfully submitted, Secretariat of the Celebration of the March 17th National Physicians' Day by the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Community, March 22nd.</p>

<h3>Modern Politics and China (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jun Shan</p>
<p>The next point is to improve the efficiency of work. Because modern countries are in a state of constant struggle, they must be prepared quickly. If they are slow to prepare, they will be defeated, invaded, and oppressed. Therefore, all countries have to have very efficient work. To have such efficient work, the following must be in place:</p>
<p>First, require a responsible and dedicated government;</p>
<p>Second, require a planned and detailed government;</p>
<p>Third, require a technically proficient and skilled government;</p>
<p>Fourth, require an experienced and knowledgeable government;</p>
<p>Fifth, require a government that speeds up time.</p>
<p>These five points are indispensable for increasing efficiency. If one is missing, efficiency will decrease. Is there a way for multi-party politics to succeed in forming such a government? Decentralization, conferences, and unity are all impossible. Because if decisions are made by the majority, if discussions are held by the majority, and if there are checks and balances from the majority, how can anything be done well? On the surface, the parliamentary form of multi-party politics means that everyone is responsible. In reality, it means that no one is responsible. Therefore, today we should reverse the past and demand responsible politics, and eliminate parliamentary politics. In other words, the first thing is to take responsibility.</p>
<p>The second thing is to have a plan. In the past, when faced with a problem, opinions filled the room and no consensus could be reached. In meetings, you proposed something, and someone else opposed it. Someone else proposed something, and you did not agree. Perhaps the next day, they would agree with your opinion from yesterday, and you would oppose it. Originally, in theory, it is good to gather wisdom from many sources, but in reality, it is exactly the opposite. The more you discuss, the more confused you become. The more you discuss, the more disputes arise. It is hard not to feel that the Jin army has already crossed the river, yet the Song people are still debating.</p>
<h3>Cao Shuming's Speech on Soviet National Defense</h3>
<p>Introducing the Key Points of Soviet National Defense for Our Country's National Defense Reference</p>
<p>To Further Consolidate China's National Defense, We Must Support and Obey the Leader</p>
<p>Yesterday morning (March 22nd), Fudan University in Jiangwan commemorated its weekly meeting, inviting legal expert Cao Shuming to speak on Soviet national defense in the university's auditorium. First, Vice President Wu Nanxuan of the university gave an introductory speech, followed by Cao's speech. Cao is skilled at lecturing. Having spent many years in Europe, he has a very deep understanding of the Soviet Union. He expressed the key points of Soviet national defense in extremely clear language, making them both profound and apparent. Not only is it a culmination of research on Soviet national defense, but it is also an important contribution for reference in our country's national defense. The key points are excerpted on the left for research and reference by those in our country who discuss national defense.</p>
<p>Cao first stated that modern national defense is not limited to military equipment. All the elements of nation-building have important implications for national defense. Today, he will discuss Soviet national defense from eight aspects: military (including industry and transportation), politics, diplomacy, law, finance, foreign trade, education, and society. First, military: Soviet military naturally ranks first in national defense. We should not only envy the greatness of the Soviet Red Army, but we should admire and pay attention to the special efforts of the Soviet authorities in heavy industry, especially the military industry. The two five-year plans laid the foundation for Soviet national defense. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Woman from Sanlintang Accuses Police Chief of Dereliction of Duty</h3>
<p>All Nine Officers of the Station Listed as Defendants; Further Investigation and Interrogation Pending Regarding the Details</p>
<p>Zhu Jinshi, a 39-year-old woman from the western market of Sanlintang, Shanghai County, Pudong, filed a complaint in the Criminal Court of the Local Court against Wang Jianhe, the chief of the local police station; Li Huanwen, the patrol officer; and police chiefs Wang and Chen, and officers Nos. 67, 69, and 123, accusing all nine officers of dereliction of duty, thus listing them as defendants. Yesterday, Judge Chen opened the court. Zhu Jinshi testified, "My husband Zhu Haishu's cousin, Jin Zhangshi, came to my house as a guest. Unexpectedly, at around 11 AM on March 9th, many police officers came to my house to arrest Jin Zhangshi and went into my room. At that time, I said, 'How can you police officers come into people's rooms? We haven't broken the law.' Then they threw aside the baby who Jin Zhangshi was breastfeeding, slapped Jin Zhangshi twice, and took her away. They also wanted to drag me away, but I refused. They tied me to a rickshaw and wouldn't even give me tea. Later, town head He Guiliang arrived and released me, so I am suing them." Defendant Wang Jianhe testified, "31 years old, from Sichuan, chief of the Sanlintang Police Station of the Shanghai County Police Bureau. Zhu Jinshi's statement is completely inconsistent with the facts. The incident was because Zhu Linbao, who runs a teahouse in the western head of Sanlintang, was gambling every day. He was arrested and punished for violating police regulations. It was found that Zhang Liansan directed the gambling in the teahouse, so I sent police officer Xia Baoyan to summon Zhang Liansan for questioning. However, Zhang's daughter, Jin Zhangshi, tore his uniform and destroyed the summons. Xia reported back to the station, and Patrol Officer Li sent police chiefs Wang Bingpei and Chen Fenghai and police officer Cao Ru to take Zhang and Jin Zhangshi into custody. While being taken to the station, they passed by Zhu Jinshi's door. Zhu Jinshi, along with more than ten women, shouted abuse and forcefully prevented our police officers from leaving. Zhang and Jin Zhangshi then ran into Zhu Jinshi's house. In order to exercise our authority, the police officers entered the house, and Zhu Jinshi shouted to many people to surround and beat the police. Police Chief Wang called Town Head He Guiliang to act as a notary public, and with He's agreement, only Jin Zhangshi was taken to the station, while Zhang Liansan escaped. Later, Zhu A'da and others came to the station and said that Jin Zhangshi had a child, so she was released on bail, but then she never appeared in court." The other defendants' testimonies were the same. The court ruled to postpone the hearing for investigation and further interrogation.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Strength</h3>
<p>— (Shou Lun)</p>
<p>Because of the expansive power of gas, even the machines made of stubborn iron can operate flexibly. Because the haulers desperately pull forward, the fully loaded boat follows forward. Under the fierce blows of the hammer, the thick iron block is pressed into thin silk sheets. The reason why people can move lively under the heavy pressure of the thick atmosphere is because of the magnificent physical strength that surpasses the atmospheric pressure. …… Simply put, wherever the power reaches, all aspirations can be achieved. Archimedes, a famous scientist in ancient times, once said a famous bold statement: "Give me a place to stand, and I will move the earth." That is exactly what it means.</p>
<p>Therefore, we dare to boldly say: "Wherever 'power can reach,' can make 'the universe change color.'"</p>
<p>Not only is the phenomenon of the material world like this, but everything in the spiritual world is also like this. When the power of a country stretches into the territory of another country, the color of the map will change.</p>
<p>Therefore, we might as well not live in the world. If we intend to live in this world, regardless of what we are dealing with, everyone must cultivate higher and greater strength.</p>
<h3>Eccentricities of Several Great Men</h3>
<p>— Meng Qiao</p>
<p>A quirk is a strange hobby, and it can be said that everyone has one. Eccentricity is the strangest of strange hobbies. For example, this publication once recorded that someone specifically likes to collect traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, etc. From the perspective of a third party, someone with a quirk must have a mental illness. At the very least, his mind must be abnormal. Recently, reading biographies of world celebrities, I discovered that almost all great men have quirks. I really don't understand whether one must have an abnormal mind to become a great man, or whether the mind must become abnormal after becoming a great man. Now, I am excerpting a few laughable quirks: The French literary giant E. Zola liked to count the number of gas lamps on the streets of Paris in his spare time from writing. The number of gas lamps on each street was recorded in detail in his diary.</p>
<p>The British writer S. Johnson liked to count the railings on the street. When he passed a large building, he would use his cane to count each railing. He believed that if he counted wrong, he would start counting again without fear of trouble.</p>
<p>The German poet F. Von Schiller had to step barefoot on a piece of ice whenever he wrote poetry, all year round.</p>
<p>When the French politician G. de Narvel took a walk after dinner, he often led a live giant shrimp. He tapped the shrimp's body with a beautiful silk rope, letting it jump around, and he slowly followed behind. When passersby gathered around to watch, he would say: "This giant shrimp is my pug dog. How quiet and honest it is? People can walk dogs on the street, of course I can walk a giant shrimp!"</p>
<h3>Child Poet Zhou Tianjian</h3>
<p>— Wei Fang</p>
<p>The young poet Zhou Tianjian is from Hukou and is 14 years old this year. When he was three years old, he moved to Jiujiang to avoid the war, and met an unknown fortune teller who said that he had a very good talent and would definitely achieve great things in the future. Because his lively and exquisite face at that time fully showed his intelligence.</p>
<p>His father was a scholar and had also been an official. He liked him very much and often taught him to read. In addition, he had a talent, so it is no wonder that he had amazing achievements.</p>
<p>At the age of five, he was very interested in poetry. He could recite and explain ancient Tang and Song poems and could even write one or two himself. When his father saw this, he was amazed by his talent and would often give him pointers. Therefore, he did nothing all day except recite poetry. However, his calligraphy and painting were also very impressive.</p>
<p>One day, his father told him about the deeds of Wen Tianxiang and Shi Kefa. He listened intently with his eyes wide open. At the end, he said generously: "We must imitate people like this. Originally, a person's death is heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather. We must not rot silently like grass and trees……"</p>
<p>He also said with a smile: "I will be a poet of the nation." Later, he worked hard to study. In less than a few years, he had considerable achievements, and of course it was easy to make progress. His poems and writings were outstanding, and for a time his fame spread throughout the area. Whenever literary figures and scholars held banquets, they would invite the young poet to participate. If there were any questions during the banquet, he could answer them fluently, and his poems were quick, skillful, and excellent, and everyone regarded him as a child prodigy. Once, Dai Jitao, the President of the Examination Yuan, passed through Jiujiang and summoned him for an interview, which made President Dai praise him endlessly.</p>
<p>Now, he has accumulated more than 200 poems, called Lai Yuan Yin Cao, whose words are fresh, elegant, magnificent, and heroic, which is truly rare. We believe that after a few more years, this young national poet will definitely become famous throughout the country.</p>
<h3>Ding Dong Hawkers</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>"Ding dong…………Ding dong…………" In our lane, we can hear the sound of "ding dong" several times a day, except on rainy days.</p>
<p>Because we hear this sound every day, it seems that we are used to it. Therefore, even the children held in our arms, as long as they hear the sound of "ding dong," will say without hesitation that the ding dong hawker has come. At that time, if you push open the door, you will see a person pushing a ding dong cart with wheels in one hand and skillfully shaking a ding dong drum in the other. Inside the wooden frame are a gong and a drum. As long as you shake your hand, the gong and the drum will sound at the same time.</p>
<p>One after another, ding dong carts are pushed into the lane every day, "Ding dong…………Ding dong…………" The sound seems a little annoying, especially at our windows. The people pushing the ding dong carts also "ding dong" and shake the drum. Sometimes the children fall asleep and are awakened by the sound, which is really unspeakable annoying. However, no matter how much I hate them, the ding dong carts are still being pushed in constantly, and there is nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p>A ding dong cart can be said to be a mobile small department store, because on this ding dong cart, all kinds of Chinese and foreign goods and household items are sold. It can be said that although the sparrow is small, it has all the vital organs. Especially the cosmetics, needles and threads used by women, as well as the toys loved by children, fill it, and even various candies are sold. However, the goods on the cart are not fixed and will change with the seasons. For example, in winter, health shirts, woolen socks, woolen yarn, and honey are displayed. In summer, they are replaced with a batch of undershirts, sweatpants, fans, fly swatters, and other things. Like in the lunar New Year, there are the most toys and firecrackers.</p>
<p>When the ding dong cart comes in, in addition to the children rushing to surround it, the maids and servants will also hurry out to buy some things, because they are working non-stop every day and can't spare time to go outside to buy them. Even housewives who lack some odd sundries, want convenience, and have someone deliver them to their door, saving them from running out, so they buy them on the ding dong cart. Therefore, a ding dong cart will sell some things. The prices of things bought on the ding dong cart are not very expensive, about the same as outside, but most of the goods are substandard. It is impossible to buy good things, especially × goods, which have been particularly numerous recently.</p>
<p>I accidentally talked to a person who carries a ding dong cart and learned that although the capital of the ding dong cart is different due to the size of the cart and the number of goods, a better cart also costs more than 100 yuan to make. And if there is sufficient goods, at least 300 to 500 yuan. It can be seen that although it is a small business, the capital is not small. In the past few years, when the market was better, they could do more than ten yuan of business every day, but in recent years, due to the decline of the entire city, they have also been seriously affected, and the average is only five or six yuan of business every day.</p>

<h3>A Plum Blossom Viewing Trip to Prince Temple, Haiyan</h3>
<p>— (Xiahu)</p>
<p>The plum blossoms in Chaoshan stretch for dozens of miles and are famous for their ancient Tang and Song plum trees. However, few know that the plum blossoms in Prince Temple, Haiyan, also stretch for several miles and also have ancient Tang and Song plum trees. However, because of its location on the coast and inconvenient transportation, it has not yet been able to achieve the same fame as Chaoshan plums. The fortune and misfortune of plum blossoms is like this. However, most things in the world are like this, and it's not just plum blossoms.</p>
<p>The temple is located outside the north gate of the county town and enshrines the statue of Han Emperor Fu Taiwei, mistakenly known as Prince, hence the name Prince Temple. The temple is dilapidated and already shows signs of decay. Usually, there are neither tourists nor incense, but when the plum blossoms are in full bloom, a few local women from the city wander in this fragrant snowy plum blossom forest. A few days ago, I and Cheng Xuemen hired a car to view the plum blossoms. Leaving the north gate, the homes on both sides were all in the middle of the plum blossoms, until we reached Prince Temple. The avenue from the north gate to Prince Temple was built after County Magistrate Zhang Shaowu came to Yantian. It is said that when County Magistrate Zhang was in Yantian, he was not greedy for money. A civil official who is not greedy for money is a good official. I came to Shanghai yesterday and visited Mr. Li Gongyu of the Xinfeng Silk Factory, who said that the plum blossoms in the plum garden near Liuying Road are in full bloom, and there are also many old branches that are graceful and lovely. Due to busy affairs, I don't know if I can fulfill this wish to find plum blossoms.</p>
<p>Biographical Notes</p>
<h3>A World's Youngest Military Officer</h3>
<p>— Ordinary</p>
<p>Félix Saralegui, born in February 1919 in Argacha, Spain. He grew up in poverty and labor. At the age of fourteen, he became a bricklayer. He sympathized with the Socialist Youth League, so he joined it; at the same time, he joined the General Workers' Alliance as a member. After three years of trade union life, he became a conscious revolutionary soldier. When the fascist rebellion broke out, he immediately rushed to the militia of Argacha and went to the front. In July and August of last year, he fought in the mountains and was promoted to squad leader. Later, due to his heroic leadership, he was elected as an adjutant.</p>
<p>Amidst the hail of bullets in Toledo, he bravely carried the elderly women who were wounded and lying on the streets to safety. The commander paid tribute to him, but he humbly refused, saying, "This is just fulfilling my duty."</p>
<p>On the Madrid front, two hundred militiamen occupied a house in the line of fire. Suddenly, the enemy attacked, and Félix's soldiers abandoned the line.</p>
<p>"Why are you running away?" he shouted, "We must take it back immediately!"</p>
<p>He shouted loudly to the fleeing soldiers.</p>
<p>Only twenty comrades followed him, but that was enough. They used grenades and rifle volleys to recapture the house. Before Saralegui and his companions' resolute defense, more enemies, including Moors, were defeated and fell, and others fled.</p>
<p>Because that position was very important, the headquarters once again congratulated him. He received the honorary title of officer. He is now seventeen years old.</p>
<p>"Why did you join the militia?" a reporter once asked him.</p>
<p>"This is my inevitable duty," he replied briefly, and then added, "Because we, the young masses, want to live freely, so we must drive out the fascist executioners at any time. This war is a duel for the right to a happier life for the masses of the people. We will definitely win!"</p>
<p>A few days ago, a detachment of the Farmers' Youth League held a meeting. A political commissar said to them: "You will be commanded by Officer Saralegui, do you agree?"</p>
<p>Everyone cheered in agreement. Now Félix Saralegui, the world's youngest military officer, leads the artillery battalion of the People's Army composed of young people, each of whom understands the goals and significance of the struggle very clearly.</p>
<h3>The Mandarin Ducks That Changed Nests</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 12 (White paper, red stationery, only two lines of tears remain, reeds and maple leaves, walking alone through half a city in autumn)</p>
<p>Guoqi said: Naturally, the man communicates with the woman first; there's no need to ask. Xiaosong said: What did you write in the first letter? Guoqi said: Of course, it's very polite. In fact, even now, the letters are still very polite. Xiaosong looked directly at his face and said: Didn't you say these are characters from a novel? How can you say they are still being polite now? Surely you know everything about this relationship between these two people. When Guoqi said the words "even now," he originally wanted to swallow them back, but once the words left his mouth, there was no way to erase them. He immediately started thinking about how to turn the conversation around. When Xiaosong asked him, he first smiled silently. Xiaosong said: Brother, you are truly an honest person; you've let the cat out of the bag. Whether it's castles in the air, based on a real person, or even based on you, I don't need to ask. I only have one suggestion. In your poems, it's as if there's someone actually there, about to emerge from the page. Such a good woman is admirable because she is so full of poetic flavor. But a woman like Lin Daiyu is no longer suitable for the times. You must write about her overcoming adverse circumstances and becoming a brand-new couple with this man. That's what I mean if you're writing a novel. If there is such a person, we should lend a helping hand to let them gain freedom. Don't just be sentimental, standing alone in the west wind before the setting sun. Guoqi said: That's hard to write. If it ends with a grand reunion, it will inevitably fall into a cliché. Xiaosong put the poem on the table. At some point, the maid had placed a cup of tea on the table. He picked up the cup, slowly took a sip, and smiled slightly: You always write about sorrow in your novels, which isn't good. At the very least, you should write about a pair of secondary characters whose marriage is very fulfilling. Guoqi laughed: I can't find such a secondary character. Let me write about you. However, the only characters you appreciate are from the Banhqiao Miscellany. I am very unfamiliar with that path. (148)</p>

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Rise Sharply and Plummet</h3>
<p>The morning market wildly surges, with Type D jumping over two yuan. In the afternoon, selling pressure returns, and the drop is also extremely severe. Trading is extremely prosperous, with only three trades made throughout the day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation at the Chinese Securities Exchange was extremely lively. The multi-party had already inclined to sell, because the price increase in recent days was too high, and many bulls took profits. Although there were occasional strong pull-ups, they had become the end of their rope, so the decline in the afternoon suddenly rose, but the trend has not yet reached the point of collapse. Today is the last day of this month, and the market situation may have drastic changes. Although the strength of this foreign multi-party company is said to be strong, it is not as good as the total number of spot goods, which is not something that ordinary people can monopolize. After yesterday's opening, the multi-party seemed to have fresh troops. The pull-up was extremely fierce. Nos. 5, 6.34, 45, and 47 were bought one after another, but Nos. 4, 10, 11, 35, 72, and 77 were sold. The sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, and the market price rose another 5.5 to 1.05 yuan, climbing up step by step, seemingly without end, reaching 96.10 to 11 yuan. The second round of frantic pull-ups increased Type D by as much as 1.3 yuan this month. For a time, many short-sellers painfully cut their losses. Nos. 18, 34, 45, and 50 bravely bought in, while Nos. 4, 5, 11, 43, and 58 were also extremely enthusiastic to sell, so the market gradually became weak. Type A still fell by 5 to 10 cents, and 96 also returned slightly by 40 cents. The afternoon opening was late, and it was changed to one trade. The financial community sold a lot, and the market price uniformly returned slightly, but most of the multi-party was still watching, so it fought back slightly by 3-40 cents to 1.1 yuan. Yesterday's market price results still rose by several tens of cents to 1.9 yuan, but Type A futures only rose by 5 cents. The total turnover was 18,055,000 yuan. Now, the results of the rise and fall are listed on the left for comparison (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flower Coarse Yarn Sales Suddenly Boom, Cotton Yarn Market Atmosphere Rebounds</h3>
<p>The rumor of increased consolidated tax is extremely prevalent. About 5,000 bales of new yarn are released.</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, and the atmosphere is calm. The actual reason is that yarn sales are still picking up, coarse yarn business in North China is smooth and healthy, and at the same time, the overseas yarn and flower market situation has rebounded, so people's hearts are becoming more and more invigorated. This month, the multi-party is preparing to receive goods. The market rumor of increasing the consolidated tax is extremely prevalent, so the futures market is even more bullish.</p>
<p>Standard yarn rises again by 1.67 yuan. At the opening of the standard yarn market in the morning, each month showed an upward trend. The overseas flower and yarn market situation has rebounded, and at the same time, the spot yarn sales market is lively. The business in North China is even more prosperous. However, most of the purchases are coarse yarn. This month, a certain merchant is preparing to receive goods, and the factory has released about 5,000 bales of new yarn. As a result, each month of standard yarn rose by 80 cents to 1.24 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. The market situation was still flat at the afternoon opening, because although Bian Shao had the intention to receive goods, on the one hand, he came out of the cage when the price rose, so the market was flat. Unexpectedly, the board opened and the table was slightly relaxed. Suddenly, it fell until the third closing. It was heard that 4,000 bales of yarn were sold and transacted, and Osaka Sanpin yarn surged by 5.5 to 9.8 yuan. People's hearts were revived, and the near month jumped wildly by 90 cents to 1 yuan.

<h3>American Cotton Decline Slightly Stabilizes, Cotton Rises Quite Rapidly</h3>
<p>The cotton market rebounded because the decline in American cotton has been curbed. The rise in Osaka Sanpin flower is particularly strong. In addition, the yarn market is rising, and people's hearts are even more tense, but some colleagues have turned from long to short. This month's delivery of 16-count raw cotton is sufficient, so the pressure is still heavy, but the original cotton of 24-count and above is becoming more and more agile.</p>
<p>Standard flower rises by 4-50 cents. At the opening of the standard flower market in the morning, each month rose uniformly, because the decline in American cotton has been curbed and rebounded by 2 to 9 pounds. Osaka Sanpin flower rose by 1.12 yuan, but the decline in Indian cotton was severe. However, the yarn sales have improved, and there is deep fear that the factory will purchase raw materials, and people's hearts are rising. As a result, each month of standard flower rose by 30-35 cents compared with the closing price of the previous day. The market situation was still firm and rising at the afternoon opening, but the multi-party massively released files, and the second round suddenly fell until the third closing. It was heard that the Dongyang market was very good, and it was expected that American cotton would be bullish again, and the buying interest was strong again.

<h3>24,000 Bales of Spot Yarn Traded in One Week</h3>
<p>The market price has risen by 4-5 yuan.</p>
<p>Since one week, the actual sales of cotton yarn have improved. Various gangs have begun to purchase due to the development of spring sales. The Sichuan gang first purchased, and the Tianjin gang also followed. The purchase of the Yunnan and Guangdong gangs is also not thin. The inland gangs' import volume is even greater, and other gangs are also purchasing. According to market rumors, most people say that since April 1, there is fear that the consolidated tax on cotton yarn will increase, and various gangs are especially anxious to load spot goods, so yarn sales are becoming more and more lively. At the same time, the world's three major cotton markets are all moving forward, so people's hearts are shaken, and market prices are rising step by step. The rise in standard yarn is particularly strong, and the near and far futures have directly crossed the 240 yuan mark to 245 yuan. It was found that the actual yarn purchased by various gangs (from March 15 to 20) totaled 24,561 bales, an increase of 16,174 bales compared with the 8,387 bales traded in the previous week.

<h3>Long-staple Indian Cotton Has Hope of Rising</h3>

Japanese merchants not only purchased to offset old amounts, but also had new transactions. Lancashire purchased Karachi flowers, and the mainland gangs bought relatively cheap black leaf Aomu Yuan spot flowers. Long-staple flowers will have the hope of rising. The statistics for the past week are attached below (unit: 1,000 bales).</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, the Weather is Mild, Cloth Sales are Booming</h3>
<p>Japanese factories' selling prices are becoming more and more firm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market, due to the re-emergence of the overseas cloth market, various customer gangs were also gradually active due to the mild weather. The Sichuan gang, which had not moved for a long time, slightly entered 2-300 pieces of serge tribute and various grades of blue cloth and colored twill. Wholesale shops and dyeing factories in this street entered more than 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill, causing Japanese merchants' market prices to become more and more firm. Fine cloth is shouting 2.5 to 5 cents higher per piece, and spot fine twill is particularly bullish, shouting 7.5 cents higher (per piece) than at the end of the tenth week. Hongfu Baoxing, the 16-pound coarse cloth from this factory, also rose by 5 cents per piece. The market price of Yihua factory's coarse cloth is unchanged, but Jin Santa's bleached cloth has raised 10 cents. Wholesale in inland areas along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines is still endless. The retail business in this street is also gradually prospering, so spring and summer goods such as satin, printed cloth, chloroth cloth, and various grades of plain silk, although the market has not increased, are more firm than last week.</p>
<h3>There is a Great Lack of Plain Goods and Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>The local customer gangs' large and small Western clothing stores all have a strong appetite for plain woolen fabrics priced at 5-6 yuan per yard, but because there is a great lack of goods in the market, the price of goods has risen quite firmly as a result. The arrival of Western goods in Shanghai is limited, and although Eastern goods have been transported, the number is also small. Among the domestic goods, only Wuxi Xiexin Factory still has products, but it is also not enough to meet the demand, so recently, shops and brokers with a little capital are mostly searching for them. This spring, foreign firms have mostly shipped mohair fabrics such as Hum's four-volume durable cloth and Halifax, but plain goods are rarely seen.</p>
<h3>Food, Xinghua New Wheat Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Selling opens at 6.05 yuan. Futures trading is still not smooth.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the association market, hundreds of bags of new wheat from that place and Hua, shipped by the Fujian gang, were of very good quality, with large particles, clean body and purple skin. This kind of goods is actually produced in the area along the Shanghai-Ningbo Road. It was soon purchased by Shenda for more than 70 bags at a price of 6.05 yuan. It is said that new wheat in that place usually needs to be around the Qingming Festival in the year, but now it is one month earlier, which is a rare event, and it is even rarer to ship to Shanghai for sale.</p>
<p>After the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, the market in each month showed a firm and then flat appearance. Because the price of foreign wheat was reported to have risen by 7-80 cents to 1.1 yuan, people's hearts were stable when the price was opened. The price of this month opened at 20 cents and 8 minutes. Trading below April was not smooth, and the market lacked vitality. When the market opened in the afternoon, because this month was not far from the suspension of trading, the customer gangs' collection volume had decreased, and the factories in this port were very懈怠, so people's hearts were not soft, and the closing price was as low as 6.24 yuan. Trading in April was not smooth, and the market also stopped. Below June, because customers' sales were not smooth, some non-professionals absorbed them, so they were better by 3-5 cents. The spot wheat market is still stable, with Kaijiangbei wheat at 6.32 yuan, followed by 20 cents, Huangqiao wheat at 6.3 yuan, followed by 20 cents, and Liuhe wheat at 6.22 yuan, followed by 20 cents. A total of about 3,000 bags were opened.</p>
<h3>This Month's Futures Flour Rises and Falls Very Quickly</h3>

The price of foreign wheat was quoted, and Chicago rebounded by 7-90 cents, Canada near rose by 1.1 yuan, and far rose by 8-90 cents. Liverpool had ups and downs with each other. After the price was opened, the people's hearts in this month were not good at first. The opening price was only 83 cents, and then the customer gangs had a slight appetite, and the floating shorts took the opportunity to quickly cover their positions. The closers of the bulls were silent, so the people's hearts were prosperous, and the closing price was as high as 88 cents and 25 cents, an increase of 50 cents and 1 cent compared with the initial opening. Below April, due to the recent rebound, the people's hearts were also charming, an increase of about 20 cents compared with the previous week. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was rumored that the inland factories in this month had 5-630 bags prepared for delivery, so people's hearts became weak again, and the lowest fell by 40 cents and 25 cents. The trading volume below April also fell by 10 cents. Then, because the short covering was still smooth, it rebounded slightly. It was found that there were only two days of trading after this month. If customer sales were flat, it could pass smoothly.</p>
<h3>Futures Beans Fall and Then Return</h3>
<p>Oil Cake Rises and Falls Differently</p>
<p>Yesterday, the standard soybean cake market rose and fell differently. After the opening of the morning market of standard beans, due to the sluggish actual sales in recent days, the arrivals were endless, and the bulls urgently sought to close their positions. The opening price in the morning once fell slightly by 4-50 cents to 70 cents. In the afternoon, the market rebounded slightly, and the spot goods of the car beans were readily purchased by the factory, and the market gradually recovered. At the afternoon closing, each of March and May was slightly down by 10 cents, and April was unchanged. Standard oil, due to the sluggish futures market and sluggish digestion, the firms continued to sell, the entrants watched, and the price returned slightly by 1-20 cents. Standard cake digestion gradually became strong, and the market also saw a report. Yesterday, the market was still flat in the morning, and then there were customer stocks asking about the price, and the market gradually built up by 2-30 cents.</p>
<h3>River Rice Still Oversupplies</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs were more surging than before, with a total of more than 90 ships arriving, totaling 18,450 stones. Among them, there were still more than 50 ships of thin rice, while the sales market was even more sluggish in this street. Although the Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Henan gangs continued to purchase 3-4,000 bags of thin rice, they still felt that the supply exceeded demand, and the customers' eating habits were still harsh, making it more difficult to support the market price. As a result, the market prices of thick and thin japonica rice continued to fall by 1.5-10 cents. Judging from the overall situation, there seems to be a downward trend in the past two days, so if there is a shortage of sources, there may be a hope of stabilizing. Du Yangjian lacked goods, and the negative yuan fell slightly by several cents, following the trend of the japonica rice market by a foot.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the number of ships coming from various places in Hexia was quite strong, about 50 ships. The transactions in the market were very懈怠, and the market was high and white japonica rice was flat and tired, and the secondary one was slightly 1-20 cents.

The price of Yangdu indica rice fell by 6-70 cents, and the price of port customer pointed rice fell by 3-50 cents.

<h3>Customer Indica Rice Sales Stalled</h3>
<p>Machine Brown Rice Falls by More than 10 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrivals of customer indica rice were still strong, but the Guangdong gangs' appetite had stalled, and it was rumored that six batches of foreign rice ordered by Guangdong Province had arrived in port, and the need for customer indica rice in the future may be stalled, and even if it is embellished, the number is limited. Therefore, the market price in the market is extremely virtual, and the transaction volume has also decreased sharply. The total transaction volume throughout the day was only more than 3,000 bags. The Northern Gang purchased 220 bags of Xiang rice, and Xi'an purchased more than 100 bags of Gan yuan. The rest was only the entertainment of this street, so the machine rice fell sharply by 15-60 cents. Brown rice had less inventory, and it also fell slightly by about 10 cents. The total transactions throughout the day were 2,783 bags of Gan rice, 220 bags of Xiang rice, 80 bags of Wenzhou indica rice, and 350 bags of Wan indica rice.</p>

<h3>Medical Science Should Actively Promote Scientific Training</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhiqian</p>
<p>(Reprinted from the 21st issue of the third volume of the "Folk Bi-Monthly")</p>
<p>At the Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee, Committee Member Jiao Yitang and others proposed to instruct the Ministry of Education to formulate regulations for the teaching of Chinese medicine and incorporate them into the educational system. Committee Member Li Zonghuang and others requested the implementation of the original proposal for equal treatment of Chinese and Western medicine from the Fifth National Congress. In today's era of national crisis and the need to revive all sectors, such proposals are not very important and have no value in being raised. However, from the perspective of medical science itself, there are a few points for Committee Members Jiao and Li to consider.</p>
<p>China today adopts Western engineering technology to build Western-style houses favored by great men and to construct highways and railways that connect cultures. We have never heard of China needing to preserve the skills of old-style carpenters and bricklayers to counter modern engineering. At the same time, everyone today hopes that the government will adopt the organization and equipment of foreign armies. We have never heard of anyone advocating the preservation of China's old-style soldier training and weapons to consolidate national defense. Only when Chinese people borrow science as the foundation for developing medicine does it cause a violent reaction in society and a meaningless dispute between Chinese and Western medicine, which is truly ridiculous! The motives of Committee Members Jiao and Li are nothing more than:</p>
<p>1. Some patients are treated ineffectively with Western methods, but then achieve good results with Chinese medicine. Thus, people say that Chinese and Western medicine have value in coexisting.</p>
<p>According to this argument, one should recognize that the strength of "Western medicine" lies in the application of scientific observation and experimental methods to study the relationship of physiological changes, not just the techniques of treating diseases. If "Chinese medicine" recognizes the value of science, understands scientific methods, and then fully utilizes scientific observation and experimental methods to study the content of "Chinese medicine" and investigate the results of "Chinese medicine" treatments, we would certainly welcome it. Unfortunately, most Chinese medicine practitioners do not understand scientific methods and content. Relying on "Chinese medicine" to study "Chinese medicine" theories is absolutely impossible. If there are one or two people who are proficient in the basic sciences of Western medicine and engage in "Chinese medicine" research, the result will be "Western medicine" researching "Chinese medicine," absolutely not "Chinese medicine" researching "Chinese medicine"!</p>
<p>At the same time, without a scientific foundation, one cannot prove the claim of "effective" or "ineffective." Individual cases are certainly worth noting, but without scientific methods of identification, personal experience is never academic or universal in natural science. If Chinese medicine practitioners or those who admire Chinese medicine all stick to individual cases and ignore the application of modern scientific methods, I have nothing to say, and Chinese medicine will never become a universally recognized academic discipline! Even in the places where scientific medicine originated (European and American countries), there are still many people who believe in folk remedies and secret prescriptions. However, these folk remedies and secret prescriptions cannot be publicly recognized as "effective" or "ineffective" before being organized using scientific methods. Those who are ignorant and unskilled may never understand this point!</p>
<p>2. In recent years, hygiene administrative personnel have all received Western medical training and have not studied the techniques of Chinese medicine. The failure of those who study Western medicine to research the content of Chinese medicine is a shortcoming in today's Chinese academic community. Indeed, medical colleges should have specialized personnel to organize the quintessence of the nation's several thousand years using scientific methods. However, this task is extraordinarily heavy. Given the current situation of lacking both people and resources, it is often impossible for "Western medicine" to research "Chinese medicine," not because it is unwilling or inappropriate. Since research is impossible and truth cannot be obtained, the result is that the "Chinese medicine" curriculum is set aside and the scientifically based "Western medicine" is used as the foundation for teaching. This is why Western medicine does not understand Chinese medicine. The fact that hygiene administrative personnel have not studied the techniques of Chinese medicine is not because they are unwilling to learn, but because those who run medical schools do not know how to use the unvalidated content of Chinese medicine to train hygiene administrative personnel. Moreover, hygiene administration includes disciplines such as vital statistics, infectious disease management, and sanitation engineering, which cannot be found in "Chinese medicine." If Chinese medicine is used to preside over hygiene administration, wouldn't that be another joke!</p>
<p>3. The promotion of Western medicine hinders the interests of merchants of "pills, powders, plasters, and elixirs," so the issue of livelihoods becomes the focus of the conflict between Chinese and Western medicine.</p>
<p>China's industry is backward, its manufacturing power is weak, and its large-scale adoption of imported goods in the application of science is detrimental to the national economy. This is the harm of promoting Western medicine. The solution is to ㊀ encourage the improvement of basic industries and ㊁ continue to promote the use of necessary imported goods. If Chinese people do not use imported airplanes and cannons, they will never think of manufacturing airplanes and cannons themselves. To have Chinese people manufacture "Western medicine" themselves, it is also necessary to use imported goods to develop the market. This kind of immediate loss is unavoidable!</p>
<p>As for the old "pills, powders, plasters, and elixirs," if they are proven to have universal efficacy, they will not only be sold domestically in the future but can also be transformed into imported goods in various countries in the East and West. If they are proven ineffective, a portion will naturally be gradually eliminated and will not be spared simply because of the proposals of the Central Committee members. One must know that enlightened people today do not oppose the sale of "pills, powders, plasters, and elixirs," but doubt the basis of such medicines. Central Committee members should encourage this doubt and promote the motivation to use scientific research to study "Chinese medicine." How can one sacrifice the permanent academic foundation of the nation for the temporary change in the livelihoods of a few people? This is too short-sighted, and such a method of protecting "pills, powders, plasters, and elixirs" will only lead to their demise!</p>
<p>Besides these, there are of course conflicts of emotions between the authorities, deliberate difficulties, and other private issues that cannot be addressed. I only hope that Committee Members Jiao and Li will propose ㊀ abolishing the terms "Chinese" and "Western" medicine and uniformly calling them national medicine. ㊁ The Ministry of Health should establish a National Medicine Research Institute, gathering famous Chinese and Western doctors in the capital to conduct medical research. ㊂ Prepare to add the results of the research to the curriculum of medical colleges.</p>
<p>It is a big joke for a country to have two schools with different basic training for one academic discipline and profession, and it is also ridiculous to have two personnel with disparate abilities (hygiene administration) receiving equal treatment! As long as the Ministry of Education uses scientific training as the basis for medical science, no matter whether the sign says Chinese Medicine Specialty School or Medical College, the results obtained will be the same sooner or later. The young people who originally studied "Chinese medicine" will all take the path of "Western medicine" to create China's national medicine!</p>
<h3>Improved Eating Habits</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>The ancients said it well: "Take the good from others to make up for your own shortcomings," and also said: "Choose the good and follow it." The meaning of this sentence, to extend it, is that if we do not learn from the strengths of others and stubbornly stick to our old ways, that is called stubbornness. But if we blindly follow others without asking whether they are good or bad, that is close to blind obedience. The stubborn are not clever, and the blindly obedient are not wise. Their foolishness is the same, and their losses are equal.</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four essential things in life. In today's Chinese cities, clothing, housing, and transportation seem to have been largely Westernized. Only in terms of diet do most people still adhere to the old Chinese ways.</p>
<p>Eating seems to be the most important of the four things! The way Chinese and foreigners eat can be said to be completely different. Is the Chinese way right? Or is the foreign way right? I think each has its advantages and disadvantages. There are two conditions for eating: first, it must be hygienic, and second, it must be economical. Foreign countries have a separate eating system, with each person eating their own portion. No matter how many people are at the table, the risk of transmitting diseases through food is unlikely to occur. This way of eating is, of course, hygienic. But the word "economical" cannot be mentioned. China has a shared eating system, with several dishes placed on a table for seven or eight people to eat with. It is extremely economical! But what about hygiene? It is too far removed from the separate eating system! Several pairs of chopsticks are used to pick at the same dish, and several spoons are used to stir in the same bowl of soup. As long as there is a patient with an infectious disease, there is always a risk of infecting those who eat together. Even if there is no infectious disease, the saliva and tartar are enough for people to share! At the same time, when Chinese people eat, they put their mouths to the bowl, lower their heads, and bend their backs. Most Chinese people in their forties and fifties are hunchbacked. The reason for this is probably due to studying at desks and eating at tables. Some people even suck in food with their mouths. When they suck, the glottis is wide open, and food can enter the trachea along with the breath, causing choking. Food scraps and saliva are sprayed all over the table, and some of them are inevitably sprayed into the public dishes and soups. Even if it is not infectious, it is inevitable that others will find it annoying. There is also the point that holding a bowl in one hand and chopsticks in the other causes the left hand to ache somewhat before the meal is finished. All of these are unhygienic and inconvenient aspects of the Chinese way of eating that are not found in the foreign way of eating.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the foreign way of eating is hygienic but not economical, while the Chinese way of eating is economical but not hygienic. This is what is meant by each having its advantages and disadvantages. Many people want to improve the Chinese eating system and advocate completely imitating the foreign system of separate eating, but in China's economic situation, it is not easy for families below the middle class to fully implement separate eating, because it is too uneconomical. In order to solve the economic problem and not violate hygienic conditions, some people advocate that each person use two pairs of chopsticks, one for taking food and one for eating. But if one is not careful, the chopsticks for eating may enter the food bowl, and the chopsticks for taking food may be put into the mouth, which is still useless. Since both of the above methods are difficult to apply, I will now introduce to the public the method that has been practiced in my family for several years.</p>
<p>This method is very simple. In addition to a rice bowl, each person has a spoon and chopsticks. The chopsticks are specifically for taking food, and the spoon is specifically for eating. In addition, two or three public spoons are placed for each person to take soup with. Whenever one wants to drink soup, one first puts the public spoon into the private spoon (the spoon for eating) and then puts it into the mouth. When eating, one also uses chopsticks to take food and put it into the spoon. The benefits of this way of eating are: first, it avoids infection; second, it does not cause hunchbacks and choking, because one does not need to put one's mouth to the food or suck in air. Third, the spoon and chopsticks are separate and easy to remember, so there is no confusion. Fourth, one does not need to hold the bowl in one's hand, which avoids hand aches. The problems of the Chinese way of eating can be said to be eliminated in one fell swoop, while the advantages of the Chinese way of eating - economy - are absolutely preserved. This method can be said to have the name of shared eating but the reality of separate eating, the benefits of separate eating, and the advantages of shared eating at the same time. The drawbacks of both separate and shared eating are swept away. People who are interested in improving the Chinese eating problem, why not try it?</p>
<p>There are many foreign habits that are worth imitating. But we must absorb their essence and not rigidly adhere to their format. This is called taking the good from others to make up for our own shortcomings, and this is called choosing the good and following it.</p>
<h3>Prospects for Medical Education in Our Country in the Future (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Chang Shih-ying</p>
<p>The introduction of modern medicine to China has a history of exactly 101 years. In the first 75 years of these 100 years, medical education and undertakings in China were entirely managed by private individuals, most of which were run by Western missionaries. During these years, they faithfully promoted their work and undertakings, so they eventually established the foundation of modern medicine in China, which we all recognize and greatly admire. In fact, even now, medical schools and hospitals under the auspices of Western missionaries and with foreign funding still occupy a very important position in China.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the Chinese government has now assumed responsibility for the management and planning of medical education throughout the country. There are currently three types of medical education institutions in the country, as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Government-established, or jointly established with the government, and provincial and municipal public institutions: 1. Peking University Medical School, 2. National Central University Medical School, 3. National Tongji University Medical Department, 4. National Sun Yat-sen University Medical Department, 5. Zhejiang Public Medical and Pharmaceutical Specialty School, 6. Hebei University Medical Department, 7. Northeastern University Medical Department, 8. Taiyuan Medical Specialty School, 9. Nanchang Medical Specialty School, 10. Hubei Sun Yat-sen University Medical Department, 11. Peking Army Medical School.</p>
<p>㊁ Privately established by Chinese citizens: 1. Nantong University Medical Department, 2. Tongde Medical Specialty School, 3. Nanyang Medical University, 4. Southeast Medical School, 5. Fengtian Medical Specialty School, 6. Xiamen University Medical Department, 7. Women's Medical Specialty School.</p>
<p>㊂ Established by foreign churches or private individuals: 1. Peking Union Medical College, 2. Kwong Jih Medical Specialty School, 3. South Manchuria Medical University, 4. Hsiang-Ya Medical College, 5. Guanghua Medical Specialty School.</p>
<p>In addition, there are domestic organizations researching new medicine, such as: 1. The Medical and Pharmaceutical Society of the Republic of China, 2. The Chinese Medical Association, 3. The Medical Missionary Association of China, 4. The Sino-German Medical Association.</p>
<p>The above passage briefly describes the progress of medical education in our country today. However, it is still in its infancy and very immature. We, the people in the medical field, must pay close attention to future developments. This is just a foundation, and to achieve future development, we must eliminate all the following errors and follow all the following regulations.</p>
<p>A. Eliminating Sectarian Ideas</p>
<p>Today (our country's medical schools only have a single-level system, which makes it easy to achieve unification. Even if a two-level system of medical schools is produced in the future, it is hoped that the level of each level can be equal. Why is this? The major problem with medical education in our country today is that the courses taught in various medical schools across the country are uneven. Not only that, but the language used to teach medical education in each school is also inconsistent. Some use English and Japanese, and some use French and German. Is medical education also regarded as an imported commodity to be sold for profit? This is a difference of a hair's breadth that can lead to a mistake of a thousand miles. New medicine is a public academic discipline of the world and is by no means unique to any one country. If we introduce this public academic discipline of the world to China, we should teach it in Chinese language and writing. If we still use foreign languages, it is easy to give people the misunderstanding that the knowledge of medicine taught in a certain country's language is called the medicine of that country. Therefore, if we want to reorganize medical education in China, we should first correct the error of using foreign languages in teaching and use Chinese for teaching to unify it. This is the first and most important point. Second, the system and curriculum of medical education in China should be systematically and organizedly compiled so that all schools across the country, whether single-level or two-level, should tend to be uniform, without the disadvantages of being uneven. If the Chinese people can earnestly carry out these two points, the future of medical education in China can be optimistic. Otherwise, it is like a blind man riding a blind horse, approaching a deep pond at night. How can they not fall? Moreover, the most unfavorable phenomenon in our country's medical field today is the establishment of various factions. Unfortunately, the division of factions is now obvious. This is truly a misfortune in China, where medicine is still very immature. Compared with the major powers, today's Chinese medicine is even worse than a maidservant imitating a lady. How can we be arrogant and claim to be factions? If factions arise, they will inevitably deceive each other, be jealous, exclude each other, and be mutually incompatible. How can we expect unity and seek progress together? This is truly a cause for a long sigh for the future of medicine in our country. I believe that we, who study new medicine, should be humble, learn from each other, and explore each other. In this way, we can gain insights and make inventions. Today, however, we are deeply poisoned by factionalism, and the spirit of cooperation is becoming increasingly fragmented, leading to complete incompatibility. It is truly heartbreaking to say this. It is hoped that those who engage in medicine in our country in the future should strive for thorough understanding and focus on research when learning. After completing their studies, they should be able to translate and introduce their knowledge in their native language. It is like food, which can only be nutritious if it can be digested. Otherwise, if one learns from a certain country and can only publish in that country's language and cannot replace it with Chinese language, then one is said to be eating old food without digesting it. What is the difference? Thinking of this, I feel that we should translate all kinds of single words and terms used in medicine so that they are exceptionally clear. Not only should we create a dictionary, but we should also gather the words of five or six countries to form a Chinese-Western comparison table. This is truly an exceptionally important plan. For example, one side uses all Chinese characters, and the other side uses Latin as the main body, with English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and other languages as guests. In this way, we can avoid the problem of Chinese people publishing medical matters in foreign languages. As for wanting to eliminate the factions between schools and teaching doctors, we should come up with other strategies. I have repeatedly discussed this method with several comrades, and they all expressed sympathy with my proposal. What is my proposal? It is to set up a medical research institute and hire medical doctors who have returned from studying in Europe, America, and Japan. All those who study medicine and have expertise, regardless of which country they studied in, should be required to have special expertise in their field and be willing to continue research and pursue further study. All such people should be invited to join the institute. The minimum period of research in the institute should be two or three years. Talents who have returned from studying medicine in various countries should gather together, each using their strengths to encourage each other. In this way, in a few years, they will not only understand each other's learning but also be able to make progress. There may also be new inventions. Moreover, having been together for a long time, they will also be able to understand each other's character and behavior, and the gaps will be eliminated. Thus, they will unconsciously forget which country they learned from, and the concept of factions will also disappear. Not only that, but on the one hand, they can engage in research, and on the other hand, they can plan for future teaching and practice from time to time. Therefore, this medical research institute is no less than a teachers' college for medical education, which can cultivate sound medical teachers for the whole country. If this plan is implemented, all medical professors in the country will come from this institute. After more than ten years, medical education in the whole country will truly be unified. Therefore, the establishment of this kind of medical research institute is truly the most urgent task and the source of fundamental treatment. At the same time, the organization of a pharmaceutical research institute should also be promoted in tandem. This is a thorough method for reorganizing medical education in the whole country.</p>
<h3>Report on Hygiene Inspections in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Other Places (6)</h3>
<p>— Chu Jin-fang</p>
<p>B. Various Medical Schools</p>
<p>1. National Tongji University Medical School</p>
<p>Tongji University Medical School was founded by the German Bao Long. It was not nationalized until after the European War. The school is located in Wusong. The various departments of the school's medical school are listed below:</p>
<p>㊀ Anatomy Hall</p>
<p>㊁ Physiology Research Hall</p>
<p>㊂ Biology Hall — Animal Hall</p>
<p>㊃ Chemistry Research Hall</p>
<p>㊄ Pathology Research Hall</p>
<p>㊅ Pharmacology Research Hall</p>
<p>㊆ Bacteriology Research Hall</p>
<p>㊇ Public Health Lectures</p>
<p>9 Clinical Departments</p>
<p>Each hall and department is well-equipped and has research work, making it one of the most complete medical schools in the country. The students of the hospital have clinical practice in Shanghai Bao Long Hospital. It is now planned to assign the Shanghai Municipal Hospital to the college as a place for practice.</p>
<p>The school's entire annual funding is 700,000 yuan, with the medical school accounting for more than 200,000 yuan. Among them, there are more than 200,000 yuan for the engineering school, and the remaining more than 200,000 yuan is for the school's affiliated senior high school and senior vocational school. The professors of the medical school are all German, and Chinese are only associate professors.</p>
<p>The school has a special precision machinery repair shop. The person in charge of the repair duties is also German and comes from the German Leit factory. All precision instruments, such as microscopes, can be repaired. This person is jointly invited by the school and the Shanghai German Merchant Yanghang. The salary is 300 yuan per month, with the school and the Yanghang sharing half each. The equipment for this instrument repair is truly a pioneering initiative in the medical field of our country.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Plants of Domestic Production (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>(101) Persimmon Diospyros Kaki, L.F.</p>
<p>(Plant) A plant belonging to the Ebenaceae family, it grows wild in the mountains and is also often planted. It is a deciduous tree. The leaves are alternate, short-stemmed, smooth on the surface, obovate or broadly elliptical, entire, and have an acuminate apex. Monoecious. During the plum rain season, axillary unisexual flowers emerge. Male flowers are cymes, small, and generally three in number. Female flowers are solitary and large. The berry is spherical or oblate, and turns red when ripe.</p>
<p>(Crude Drug) Persimmon calyx Calyx Kaki is collected as the calyx attached to the fruit and dried. The woodware is light green or brownish-yellow, split into four lobes. The lobes are ovate and reach 15-20 mm in length. The inner surface has short hairs. The taste is pronounced and astringent.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) Persimmon calyx contains a nitrogen-free crystalline substance with a melting point of 2750°C.</p>
<p>The pulp contains about 14% invert sugar, 0.3% free acid (mainly malic acid), tannins, and oxidizing enzymes.</p>
<p>The endosperm of the seeds contains a large amount of Maunan</p>
<p>The white powder on the surface of dried persimmons is mannitol.</p>
<p>Persimmon astringent juice contains a tannin-like substance called Shiboul (empirical formula C14H20O9).</p>
<p>Regarding the removal of astringency from persimmons, astringent persimmons are usually placed in barrels of residual alcohol or immersed in warm water at 30-40°C for twelve hours. This method is nothing more than using the oxidizing enzymes in the cells to cause the tannins accumulated in the cell gaps to take effect, causing the cells to die. As a result, the tannins are oxidized and become a tasteless substance. The Japanese Sawamura once proved this method by experiment. He cut an astringent persimmon in half, and after treating one half with chloroform vapor, causing it to take effect, he analyzed it and found that it contained 15.91% sugar and no tannins. The other half, which had not been treated with chloroform, contained 16.18% sugar and 8.23% tannins. Therefore, in the removal of astringency from persimmons, the sugar content hardly increases or decreases, but because of the disappearance of tannins, it feels even sweeter.</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) Old sayings: Persimmon calyx is effective in treating persistent hiccups. The dosage for one time is 8 grams, used as a decoction.</p>
<p>Prescription example: Persimmon Calyx Decoction, effective for treating hiccups.</p>
<p>Persimmon calyx 8.0 cloves 8.0 ginger 3.0</p>
<p>Decoct the above in 100 and take immediately.</p>
<p>Dried persimmon (persimmon cake) or persimmon frost (the white powder on the surface of persimmon cake) has a cough-suppressing effect.</p>

<h3>Smuggling Copper Coins for Export</h3>
<p>— Ying Chun</p>
<p>Japanese and Korean people smuggling in North China has become an open secret, and this activity has spread to the north and south of China in less than half a year. From the perspective of our national sovereignty, this is undoubtedly illegal. However, so far, our authorities have not only failed to take effective preventive measures but have instead allowed it to intensify! At first, it was done secretly, but later they dared to openly rob and attack customs officers. Needless to say, this is very distressing. However, this kind of thing only appeared in areas where the central authority was weak, but now even in Shanghai, which is under public scrutiny, this kind of violent drama is being staged.</p>
<p>According to a report on the 21st, the day before yesterday, after 12 o'clock at night, more than a hundred Japanese and Korean vagrants who were smuggling copper coins gathered in the "Japan House," a Japanese inn opposite the Huishan Wharf in Tilanqiao. Each person wore specially made clothes with huge pockets all over, filled with copper coins, about five thousand coins each, totaling about seventeen or eighteen thousand yuan. They boarded the 'Shanghai Maru' successively from the Huishan Wharf. Vagrants were stationed along the way, heavily guarded. At about 3 o'clock yesterday morning, when the last batch of vagrants fully loaded with copper coins were boarding the ship, they were discovered by customs officers, who immediately went forward to search. Unexpectedly, the vagrants took out pre-prepared iron rulers and other weapons and attacked the customs officers, resulting in seven Chinese and Western customs officers being seriously injured, one of whom had his hand bone broken. The Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai was informed and immediately sent staff to the ship to rescue the customs officers. Seeing that the matter had been exposed, they had to order the vagrants to hand over about two or three thousand yuan in copper coins, which were loaded into two trucks and transported to the customs as a way to shirk responsibility. The remaining more than ten thousand yuan was still loaded onto the "Shanghai Maru" and shipped out.</p>
<p>Another source added that the vagrants have been smuggling copper coins for export for a long time. Dishonest merchants in the Wusong Road and Gongguan Road areas of this city have been buying them on behalf of the Japanese. Each time Japan exports, they load large quantities of copper coins. This secret was only revealed yesterday morning. A month ago, the price of copper coins in this city soared due to excessive purchases by the Japanese. Fortunately, the Central Bank exchanged a large number of one-cent copper auxiliary coins, which gradually stabilized the situation. However, certain parties are still recklessly smuggling them as usual. What was seized yesterday was only a small part of it.</p>
<p>Judging from the above facts, it is natural to imagine that the smuggling of copper coins by the Japanese and Koreans is organized and planned. Otherwise, our customs officers would not have suffered the misfortune of having their bones broken. At the same time, the Japanese's barbarity, arrogance, and contempt for our national sovereignty can also be imagined. We don't need to worry about whether they are smuggling copper coins for the purpose of manufacturing artillery shells, but at this moment, when Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is being loudly promoted, repeated attempts to disrupt our country's finances make it impossible to believe their sincerity. This incident of copper coin exports leading to the beating of customs officers, I think, can probably be regarded as a head-on blow to those who are fascinated by Sino-Japanese cooperation, making everyone wake up, right?</p>
<h3>North Star</h3>
<p>— Luo Yu</p>
<p>A lonely, hazy sky outside the window, the black fingers of night adorned with a few golden stars in the corner. The wind has stopped blowing, but in the desolate and melancholy space, the stars shine brightly in a painted canvas.</p>
<p>These few stars, linked together, seem to be playing a game of catching geese far away. Such a game was my favorite pastime in childhood, and now I remember it again, and I see it again. I lie in my bed, peering out from under the covers. It is very cold outside.</p>
<p>I have moved here for three days. The first time I saw these stars from my bed, my soul almost laughed aloud, I almost cried. As I peer from under the covers, through the dim air of this room, over the black horizontal line of the rooftops opposite, I cannot be sure how far I have traveled, yet they are playing my childhood's old game of catching geese.</p>
<p>Once it was late at night. The alley was completely silent, it should have been the time for nightingales to visit, but this place was only filled with cunning dreams, and I never even heard the lovely bird sounds, but the stars? They shone brighter, dazzling.</p>
<p>I have become familiar with their positions; I cannot say their names. Those names are hidden in the hearts of astronomers, both solemn and beautiful. How interesting it would be to ask an astronomer! How amazing! But I cannot know, and can only gaze deeply, deeply and unblinkingly. The cold air flowing in through the cracks hisses at my eyes. My eyes are very tired. They become stiff, turned into flint, turned into golden arrows, unable to move for a second, unable to close for a second. These are no longer my eyes, they are two companions of the stars.</p>
<p>I see those stars quietly moving and shifting in the lonely canvas-like sky. Their games, sent over after who knows how many ages, are ancient, even more ancient than our ancient ancestors; progressing slowly. The night grows deeper. They move to the lower left corner of the canvas.</p>
<p>I had a dream: in the summer night's courtyard, my lonely, loving mother was fanning away the mosquitoes for me. I lay flat on a long bench, listening to the sound of the shadow puppet show from outside the village carrying over the silent flowers and leaves, my eyes glancing at the constellations of the northern sky.</p>
<p>"Mom, what are those stars called?" I asked curiously, "Those stars in a string."</p>
<p>"That's the Big Dipper," my mother said in a calm voice.</p>
<p>"And over there?" I asked greedily, "Those three by that white cloud?"</p>
<p>"Not white clouds," my mother said in a loving voice, "That's the Milky Way; that's the Cowherd; on this side of the river is the Weaver Girl; and there's also Taurus."</p>
<p>The night silently crept over the earth. The stars were lonely and remote. The sound of the shadow puppet show from outside the village stretched into the late hours, and the stars quietly moved and shifted. I saw a star, and I asked my mother in surprise, "That bright, big star, why doesn't it move?"</p>
<p>"That bright, big star," my mother said in a kind voice, "That's the North Star, it never moves."</p>
<p>Suddenly, countless dazzling lights and bewilderment leaped before my eyes, the stars circled the heavens, rapidly spinning, they spun around that big, never-moving star, creating sparks, pulling into golden threads.</p>
<p>I sang the praises of the joy in the dream.</p>
<h3>The Story of the Will-o'-the-Wisp</h3>
<p>— Liu Ying</p>
<p>Long ago, Liu Town had only three families, living a scattered life of farming. Outer Mountain Village was a mass burial ground, so will-o'-the-wisps often appeared.</p>
<p>Outer Mountain Village is a high slope, filled with graves, some still with nameless tombstones - perhaps because the years were long, the words were worn away by wind and rain. Below the slope is a small river, the water is emerald green, always seeming to carry a bit of civility.</p>
<h3>Morning</h3>
<p>— Shen Bing</p>
<p>The white, misty morning fog blew into my house; a window had been pushed open by the wind last night. The warm air lingering between the thick quilts gradually dissipated, and my head, exposed outside the quilt, couldn't help but shrink back in my dream. I had such an insignificant dream: it felt so easy, in one night, I reached out and shook down the golden stars all over the sky. But when I woke up, all I could find on last night's pillow was a pile of cold tear stains.</p>
<p>I closed the window. The white mist lost its exchange with the slow air indoors. The water mist on the window glass condensed into droplets and trickled down, washing into two transparent gaps like distant expanses. Outside the window, the sky was filled with dancing mist.</p>
<p>The distant sea waves splashed onto the rocks and dragged white foam back, only the wind tip in the memory, even the huge roof could not penetrate the dense fog layer. A uniform haze was soaking everything from far to near.</p>
<p>The mist and dew soaked through the shoes of pedestrians, and countless small water droplets condensed on their upturned short hair. Each in a silent figure walked out from the corners of the houses, walking alone and disappearing into the smoke-like fog layer. Occasional vehicles rolled across the road, not the car carrying people, but people pulling the car. The back of the person pulling the car was slightly hunched.</p>
<p>The steaming white vapor pouring out of the tofu shop diffused into the narrow street corner. A small dog on the threshold curled up, as if resting by a warm stove. The door of the house across the street opened suddenly, and a hand stretched out from inside the door and poured something into the center of the street, then gently closed it again.</p>
<p>The small dog on the threshold scurried over with its short legs, and ran in a puff of smoke. The dog sniffed around the pile of discarded medicine dregs in the road, stretched out its two front legs to grasp it, as if grasping the cold chest of the gravel road.</p>
<p>Smoke from the chimney on the roof of that house was already swirling with coal smoke.</p>
<p>Outside the dense circle of fog, the sun stretched out a bit of red tongue, licking the uniform sky, the thick fog collapsed like snow in the sun. A gust of wind swept across the sky, and the fog thinned. Gauzy skirts, subtly bright, swayed in the wind before the window.</p>
<p>The whistle of a distant train pierced the sky, which was frozen cold by the fog. Unseen iron wheels rolled on two shining parallel rails, spraying panting coal smoke. It was suspected to be carrying the light of morning from afar.</p>
<p>Good morning!</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Seeming to flow endlessly, the water surface had ripples, and at the same time, the sound of murmuring trickles could be heard.</p>
<p>The three families in Liu Town were the descendants of ancestors who had carried their belongings from distant Shanxi, seemingly during the reign of some Great Qing emperor. They had no expectations and settled in the barren land, diligently cultivating every day. In winter, they also went into the mountains in groups to cut firewood. They did not feel lonely, nor did they feel monotonous, even though it was only a family of more than ten people.</p>
<p>One bleak autumn night, silence filled the surroundings of Liu Town. They returned from cutting firewood in the mountains. On the way, Da Shunzi was singing a folk song. Suddenly, the weather turned gloomy, and the autumn insects stopped chirping. All of them remembered the ghost stories told by the old people, and the more they thought about it, the more afraid they became. Liu Shunzi also stopped singing. Everyone felt the same fear and terror in their hearts, and even their footsteps seemed to become a little labored.</p>
<p>Liu Shunzi: When was it? Xiao Wogezi felt he couldn't remain silent and seemed to want to embolden himself by speaking. However, his voice couldn't help but tremble.</p>
<p>"Soon, there's only half a li to the bottom of the mountain." Liu Shunzi was more experienced, but he was just as terrified. They continued their journey while talking.</p>
<p>"Ah, where did that light come from?" The person in front, upon discovering the light, immediately put down his bundle of firewood and stopped moving forward.</p>
<p>The light got closer and closer. They lost their composure and with a shout, ran eastward, each minding his own business,</p>
<p>In the morning, a group of people found Xiao Wogezi's body in the graveyard. Soon, several others died one after another. Afterwards, only Liu Shunzi remained to tell people the story of the will-o'-the-wisp.</p>
<p>The population gradually became denser, and batches of people moved in from outside. When going to the mountains to collect firewood, they never dared to wait until late at night to return. They filled a load and sat in front of the Shidi Temple to eat steamed buns, listening to Liu Shunzi tell the story of the will-o'-the-wisp.</p>
<p>One day, Liu Cheng got drunk on the white liquor he had brought with him on the mountain. When he returned, he fell behind others and fell asleep alone on the hillside outside the pass. But no one dared to visit him, all thinking back to the story of the will-o'-the-wisp harming people. They thought Liu Cheng was surely suffocated to death with blood flowing from his nostrils and his face turning black.</p>
<p>The next day, Liu Cheng did not die, but had slept soundly all night. When he told the story of last night, the courtyard was crowded with people, all craning their necks.</p>
<p>"I was drunk as mud. All around me were lights, but I had not done anything bad, so I could be very peaceful..."</p>
<p>He was very energetic and very happy. When he said that he had not done anything bad, he seemed particularly energetic.</p>
<p>The population became denser. Everyone took Liu Cheng as an example. When they were preparing to go out at night, they first examined whether they had done anything bad, and they also tried their best to drink enough old liquor. It was said that liquor could suppress the will-o'-the-wisp. Relying on his own experience, Liu Cheng moved to the outside of the mountain pass, which is now the very prosperous Shanzhuang.</p>
<p>The will-o'-the-wisp never harmed people again. Moreover, it completely disappeared. Only old people told the story to children like a fairy tale when they basked in the sun.</p>

<p>Opening "Daiyu Visits the Sick"</p>
<p>The beauty of Xiaoxiang's concubine is unparalleled. Listening, the parrot recites poetry to the point of heartbreak. The golden wind blows down the autumn tung leaves. Her slender and delicate body feels the evening cool. She stops embroidering. She covers the gauze window, and bathes in the orchid room, managing her remaining makeup. Lightly applies snail-shaped ink for spring mountain green. Lightly dyes rouge with orchid musk fragrance. Jade carvings slantingly comb into a greasy cloud bun. Red silk pants reveal snowy skin and fragrance. She stands quietly on the jade steps without a word. She lightly shakes a round fan facing the setting sun. The golden crow gradually disappears into the western mountains. The moon rises and shines on the flowers and silver walls. She turns and tosses, pitying her delicate shadow. She softly calls Snow Goose to light the silver lamp. Purple Cockscomb, asks the mistress. Why do you always sigh and weep? Her heart is full of unspeakable things. For whom does she become thin and lose her beauty? Helplessly, the water clock drips on. She removes her wide silk clothes and gets on the ivory bed. She only hears the rain hitting the plantain and wetting the crabapple.</p>

<p>Opening "Country Young Mistress"</p>
<p>In the morning, the rising sun shines red on the window, and the birds sing and the flowers are fragrant, full of morning air. The mistress has finished washing and dressing in her room and goes to the hall to greet her husband's parents. Kind, gentle, virtuous daughter-in-law, not the same as ordinary women. The lady of a great family is polite, happy and smiling. She is rare to know the rituals and poetry, sewing and weaving with joy. She does not dye modern new patterns, nor does she follow the frivolous customs of learning to be clever. She manages the family affairs in an orderly manner, regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter. Assisting her husband, she is worthy of being a female hero. She teaches the children by the red lamp at night. Deep in her orchid boudoir, she works diligently. She does not recognize the west and east roads when she goes out. Frugal and thrifty in managing the family is a great virtue, plain clothes and simple meals give a happy heart. She accompanies her young sister-in-law in reciting a poem, pondering the poetic lines in the painted building. She accompanies her husband in a game of chess, her slender fingers are exquisite. She serves her husband's parents with joy and attends to their meals, her seasonings tasting like the work of heaven. On a sunny window, she casually writes a picture, the brush is full of ink, revealing a brilliant flower. Her husband's parents are all happy. Happiness can be complete, which is not easy. The high hall celebrates her birthday, reporting more sons. She smiles towards her husband, when will she hold them to see her father-in-law? A kind of tenderness is truly delicate, after all, the rural etiquette is admirable. She does not know modern infatuated women, two modern children are cages, and does not envy modern easy appearance.</p>

<h3>The Bright Light Theater Group's two comedies "The Proposal" and "The Wedding"</h3>
<p>A Humor Comparison of Gogol and Chekhov</p>
<p>The Lively Treasure on Nikolai's Ninth-Rank Official's Estate</p>
<p>A Sister Piece Surpassing the Cherry Orchard's Inspector General</p>
<p>After the Bright Light Theater Group prepared to participate in the Spring Joint Performance, it decided on two plays; only this year was it confirmed that both were Russian comedies, one was Gogol's "The Wedding," known as the "Father of Russian Literature," and the other was Chekhov's "The Proposal," known as the "King of Short Stories"; "The Proposal" is Chekhov's one-act play, translated by Cao Jinghua, included in the drama collection "The Boor" in the Unnamed Society series. "The Proposal" is a rare comedy in Chekhov's works, completely based on his unique novel style, it can be said to be a novelistic drama, filled with his so-called tearful smile. Anyone who has read Chekhov's novels will probably acknowledge this. In "The Proposal," Chekhov's humor is even more developed.</p>
<p>"The Wedding" is Gogol's work following "The Inspector General," translated by Geng Jizhi, serialized in "Translation." Although this play and "The Inspector General" are in the same mood, after carefully reading it, the fun is different. We can see ease everywhere in this play, and it is not like "The Inspector General" which makes people laugh wildly, but the effect of the comedy surpasses all other dramas.</p>
<p>Now putting "The Proposal" and "The Wedding" together should be an interesting process, but the time these two plays were produced is exactly the opposite. "The Wedding" reflects the ugliness of the Russian officialdom in the 1840s; "The Proposal" reflects the various human sentiments of the ninth-rank official's estate in the 18th century. Although both are important events in life, a comparison will definitely reveal the different attitudes of Gogol and Chekhov in observing society. What is most satisfying is that the translations of the two plays are not only directly translated from the original text but are also translated by Geng Jizhi and Cao Jinghua, who are very knowledgeable about the Russian language. So, the text is not only faithful but also very beautiful. We believe that when the audience watches the plays, in addition to understanding the advantages of the two original authors' work intentions, they will also feel the advantages of the two translators' translations.</p>
<h3>Dangerous Women</h3>
<p>— Great Shanghai Film</p>
<h3>"Life, Death, and Love" All Sorts of Things</h3>
<p>The Forties Theater Society Changes Its Style</p>
<p>This time the Forties Theater Society participated in the joint performance. The Society adopted "The Sacred Flame" written by the modern British playwright S. Maugham. The plot is extremely confusing and tortuous. When the curtain opens, it can arouse the audience's interest. Following that, as if falling into five miles of clouds, there is a general tendency to not leave the seat until the end of the scene. According to this drama, it has been performed more than a thousand times in New York and London, and has also won a lot of praise in Paris. This is the first time the Forties Theater Society has performed a foreign drama.</p>
<p>"Sacred Sacrifice" Renamed "Life, Death, and Love"</p>
<p>The Forties Performance Committee passed a resolution to hire Mr. Sun Shiyi as the director of this play. After Mr. Sun nodded in agreement, he immediately stepped up his work, and revised it in ten days, and renamed it "Life, Death, and Love," because there are unique insights into the three major problems of this life in the play. The current version of Mr. Sun has been revised will make the Chinese audience feel the greatest satisfaction.</p>
<p>Sun Shiyi talks about performance methods</p>
<p>Someone asked Mr. Sun Shiyi about the performance plan and methods of this play. Mr. Sun said, "At present, it has been decided to adopt a realistic performance method. It is best to arrange the language, movements, and expressions item by item during rehearsals." In recent days, all the actors have been stepping up rehearsals, and the final general rehearsal will be held in the coming days.</p>
<p>The New System of Two Groups Performing in Rotation</p>
<p>The whole play is divided into three acts, and nine people are required to perform. The Forties Theater Department decided to have eighteen people perform this play, divided into two groups, that is, two people are responsible for one role. When rehearsing, all eighteen people are required to attend. According to the theater department, this method is not preparatory in nature. The main thing is to give the members more opportunities to act in plays, and to be able to exert different acting skills and styles under the same director's plan. As for who will play which role, it will be fully disclosed by the Joint Propaganda Committee of the theater groups in the coming days.</p>
<p>Li Shengyun is Busy Reading Foreign Magazines</p>
<p>This time, the person in charge of costumes for the Forties performance has been changed to Ms. Li Shengyun. The lady has been busy consulting foreign magazines and running to Western clothing stores in recent days. According to her, the plot of "Life, Death, and Love" takes place in the four or five years after the European War. The evening dresses and casual clothes for men and women must be made according to the styles of that time.</p>
<p>The Setting of "Life, Death, and Love"</p>
<p>The setting of "Life, Death, and Love" has been discussed as early as half a month ago. It is now the responsibility of Mr. Zhao Ming, and Mr. Zhang Yunqiao, Xu Xingzhi, Wu Yaqing, and other gentlemen have been invited as consultants. It is heard that the setting has been generally decided and is quite gorgeous.</p>
<p>The Joint Publicity Committee of the Theater Groups is Established</p>
<p>The joint performance of various theater groups is aimed at the necessity of having the preparatory committee unify the publicity work. The Joint Publicity Committee was established, organized by one representative from each of the five theater groups, and is responsible for all publicity matters this time.</p>
