<p>時評</p>
<h3>國際形勢與全面抗戰</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>日本帝國主義者每次進攻中國的時候。總是利用着有利的國際形勢。在九一八事件發動時固然如此就是這次的進攻盧溝橋佔領平津而圖吞併整個華北也仍然是抓住有利的時機發動所謂有利於日本侵略的目前國際形勢主要的是歐洲方面德意正擬乘西班牙叛軍軍事勢力發展之際一鼓作氣推翻凡倫西亞合法政府的統治權使英法蘇等國不得不以全力來𧩜應付。而無暇顧及遠東的烽火。同時英國保守黨政府以親日態度。始英日談判。以及蘇聯內部清黨的厲行。在本軍部看來。也都是進攻中國的好機會。於是盧溝橋的砲聲鄉了日本吞併整個華北以至於整個中國的軍事進攻就殺動了。</p>
<p>因為目前的國際形勢頗有利於日本的侵略行動於是在戰事剛發生時。各國多希望董溝橋事什地方化不。要擴大。尤以過去數年帮助我國經濟建設最力的英國。態度更為明顯。是我們若以此而卽主張等待。對於日本帝國主義之有計劃的大現模進攻不發動全面的抗戰那就大錯而特錯了這種過盧的見解。對於我們抗戰的前途。頗有妨礙。非加以糾正不可。</p>
<p>第一日本這次的進攻是有計劃的大規模的進攻非吞併整個華北不止。因此我們對於這種危害我民族生存的侵略行動。除了予以全面抗戰外賓沒有第二條出路而且日本的進攻正利用有利的國際形勢我們如果也因為國際形勢關係等待着。那正中了日本的訐計。必至全民族都淪為日本的奴隸。</p>
<p>其次。我國因鑒於九一八事進時過於信賴外援。袍着不抵抗主義以致喪失若大的土地於是在數年前卽喊出“自力更生”的口號對於國際的聲援已經不懷着極大的希望所以目前國際形勢的演變並不能阻止我們發動保存民族生存的抗戰。</p>
<p>再次目前的國際形勢雖於我們抗戰的前途不甚有利。但是國際形勢是隨時在變邊的。我們可以自己的力量去轉變國際形勢。使其發展為有利於我們的局勢轉變國際形勢的步驟第一是我們對於日本帝國主義的進攻。要予以全面的堅决打擊。使其不能能易造成旣成事實。來做阻止各國干涉的藉口。祇有在我們發動整個的持久的抗戰以後。才能夠博得國際的同情。例如英國在這次事變初起時。本希望戰事地方化。能夠早日解決。但後來因為日本的得寸進尺以及我軍的奮勇抗戰英國已對日本不再有所希望而停止正在進行中的英日談判了現在英國的態度雖還希望華北戰事不致擴大。可是在我們發動全面抗戰以及日本的侵略行動對於英國的遠東利益有更進一步的打擊時。英國是必不會先動無中的。英國情形如此。其他如美蘇等國也正相同。所以目前的國際形勢。在我們發動全面的與持久的抗戰後是可以改變的其次。我們要在外交上採取積極的行動使國際形勢轉為有利於我們。我們過去因過於注重“自力更生。”對於同情於我們的國家不曾育很好的聯絡以致在外交上的地位頗為孤立其實在國際關係日趨複雜與密切的情境下。就是强國也在拚命的找與國（如日德締結防共協定。德意祖成侵略軸心。以及法群簽訂互助協𩀝。）何況我們弱國。我們過去雖對這點沒有多加注意。現在還可趕速進行。我們所要找的與國。當然是民主陣綫中的英美法蘇等國。只要我們有堅决的抗戰决心。總不難找到盟。女尤其是同我們昆連的蘇聯。因為日本的進攻中國對於它的安全是一個間接的威假如我們堅决抗戰。它是不會舍棄我們這個盟國的。這在上月三十日孫院長的談話中已有顯明的解釋了。所以我們如及早在外交上作積極的活動。國際形勢也是會轉變為有利於我們的。</p>
<p>最後。目前的國際形勢雖有利於日本的侵略行動。但與九一八時的情形已大不相同。這因為蘇聯的還東軍力已比前更加增強。英國對於日本的侵略野心還比西門外相時代更認識清楚。而羅斯福政權也比胡佛總統更痛恨侵略者的行動。所以只要我們發動堅决的持久的全面抗戰。同時在外交上採取積極的行動。目前的國際形勢是會很快的改變過來的。要是我們還顧慮眼前國際形勢。聽從一些帝國主義外交家的欺瞞。而不立刻發動全面抗戰。祇一味的等待着時機。那末只有死路一條了。</p>

<h3>到底誰的空軍精銳</h3>
<p>— 本報駐歐記者列山</p>
<p>西班牙內戰中試驗的結果</p>
<p>這是一件公開的秘密，列强正在利用西班牙內戰的機會，把馬德里前綫當做本國兵工廠的試驗所。由于量方面來說，也許兩方都感到運輸的困難，不能夠盡量供給；祖在質一方面，各國都亳不吝惜地拿出本國最新式的軍機來，這尤其是空軍的武器·據英美軍事記者在馬德里戰綫上視察的結果，空軍在此次西班牙內戰中佔一個很重要的地位。幾乎每一陣地的得失全是依告空軍矗炸酌成績。新近政府軍第一次在馬德里作大規模的反攻，雙方每日德用在空中戰爭的飛機常達一二百架。轟炸機，驅逐機，偵察機各色各樣全備·因為這是一個大規模的試驗，無怪各國都派空軍專家在馬德里視察·（這裹，我們希望國內軍事當局也派一二位空軍武官到西班牙去·）經過一年來實地試驗的結果，各國的飛機製造業自然更加進步。這是說，未來的世界大戰將更悲慘！</p>
<p>供給西班牙以飛機並空軍人才的生要國家，是法，俄，德，意，四國。到底誰的空軍精銳，據大部分英國記者的批評，飛機以蘇俄的產品最精良，法意也不錯，德圈的飛機最劣，不過德國的空軍人才作戰的精神極佳，所以補救了飛機的弱點。</p>
<p>新近一位法國航空家，（他十西班牙內戰暴發後即投效政府軍方面任空軍中隊長職，）曾以他實際的經驗發表了一篇文章·他的說法也許不無一些主觀的地方，但由此我們卻可以得到一點西班牙空戰的眞相。他認為：</p>
<p>德國的空軍一人才比機器好</p>
<p>他這種說法，大體上是對的·上次歐戰時，德國的第一架軍用飛機是由于模做被擊落的法國飛機製造而成。機器的笨重，據脫假如不是德國人有良好的軍人精神，那根本就無法同敵人的空軍抵抗·二十年來，德國的飛機製造業固然有驚人的進步，但始終總不及法意等國的精巧。在馬德里天空　　德國空軍的特色，仍是在於空軍將士的作戰精神·這位作者說：“德國人有一種驚人的作戰精神并頑強的耐力。假如你碰着一架德國飛機，那末你就明白，經過一塲大戰以後，這兩位敵人總有一們不會生還。”他承認，在室戰申德國人有鎮靜的態度，通常他的飛機略受砲火，絲毫不能動搖她的勇氣，除非他本人也受了傷·這位作者會親自擊落兩架德國的驅逐機。不過，他很客氣地說，那是他的運氣，同時也要加功于他的飛機比德國的亨克耳幾高明。</p>
<p>意大利的空軍—機務于人</p>
<p>這位作者對於意大利空軍的批評，遠不及對於德國空軍的客氣。他說，意大利人在緊要關頭，時常會採用，三十六計走為上計”的方法·雖然，他說，這大利的空軍同意利的步兵比較起來叉要良好得多了。</p>
<p>意大利的空軍人員都經過了長時期的訓練，對於現代空中戰爭的方法也十分純熱。意大利商的飛機也要比德國飛機優良。但意大利空軍在佛闡戈將軍郁隊中仍佔一個次要的地位·原因意大利人似乎不及德國人那么有毅力·常雙方在空中接戰的時候，他們立刻顯出心慌，平時優良的技術至此全部消失。機關槍的砲火愈迫愈緊，他們的戰鬥力就態戰愈衰弱。終於不是被擊落或被迫降落，就是開足馬力逃回去。據作者的經驗，他說：“那自然是有例外的。一部分意大利飛行人員也有奮鬥到底的勇氣不過是很少數。”</p>
<p>蘇俄的空軍一人才與機器兩妙</p>
<p>據這位作者的批評，在西班牙天空上當以蘇俄的空軍為最出色。他說，那是一種事實，并不是在替蘇俄宣傳。在許多次空戰中，蘇俄的空軍到處表現出他們的能力。一架蘇俄飛機平常碰到七八架德意的驅逐機，也許因為“寡衆不敵”的闢係要被擊落，但蘇俄的空軍人員卻都奮戰到底。不會輕易屈服的。有時在這種不利的局面中，他們還會得到最後的勝利。</p>
<p>他認為蘇俄空軍。第一個、特畏的地方，在於飛機。蘇俄的出品，遠在德意之上，這無論在速度，高度方面來說。其次，蘇俄空軍人員的作戰技術都十分純熟，普通一位廿九歲的飛行家平均都有兩千小時的飛行經驗。三十歲左右的更有一三千小時的飛行經驗。所以在駕駛術上地們有絕對的把握。尤其是放射機關槍的準確。在在是使敵人家心。再次，他們也有不怕死的精神，能夠沉着應戰。這位作者說，蘇俄的空軍人員，最少同德國人一樣，都是第一流的軍人。</p>
<p>他覺得唯一不幸的事情，就是蘇俄供給西班牙政府軍的飛機過少。與德意供給佛蘭戈將軍的飛機比例起來，比數為一對六。這是說，一架蘇俄飛機要敵六架或六架以上的德意飛機。</p>
<p>法國的空軍</p>
<p>大約因為作者是法國人，所以他對於法國空軍在西班牙的戰績一字不提，照一部分旁觀者的佔計，法國空軍的實力似乎在德意之上。作者本人的成績，就是一個例。肥得半年前，法國航空部部長⼽特也公開說過，法國最新式的飛機在馬魯里前棧上却很安全可靠，被擊落的只是法國的舊式飛機。也許事實上，法國所供給的飛機數目有限，所以直到今天，在這方面我們還得不到詳細的材料。</p>
<p>西班牙的空軍</p>
<p>西班牙原有的空軍不但數量有限，就是飛機也購自外國。并且大部分都是舊式的。等到內戰爆發以後，雙方才得到後台老板的帮助，利用外國的機器並人才聞始組織一種現代式的空軍。德意一方面，法俄另一方面。四班牙人在西班牙的空戰中反而佔一個不算重要的地位。據道位作者的報告，政府軍方面只有一位西班牙飛行家，駕駛了最新式的蘇俄飛機曾擊落佛蘭戈的飛機十五架。佛蘭戈方面，也只有一位西班牙人用意大利的飛機擊落了十架政府軍飛機。其餘的西班牙空軍人員，目前還在訓練中，一時尚談不到特殊的成績。</p>
<p>此外，值得我們注意的，就是最新式的高射砲，效用仍是有限得很。高射砲所射落的飛機百分率很低。根據四班牙空戰試驗的成績，這位作者所得的結論是：以飛機對付飛機，仍是最有效的防空方法。</p>

<p>潘氏演說</p>
<p>繼由潘局長演說、略調鄙人今天要說的可分為三點、第一·是“我死則國生”現在是我們國家民族的最後關頭、這次作戰定要用全國力量、全民力量、要每個人、有着非生即死、非有即亡的心理、來挽救這最大的危機、最後的勝利、是屬於我們的、反之惟有滅亡、第二·一信仰政腑、埋頭準備”、現在一般人的心理、都以為我們中國、是非戰不可了、我們不是軍事專家、範直可以說對於軍事、是完全門外漢、我們决不可冒充軍師、如果我們現在有我們傑出的軍事天才、我們祇要信仰他、他一定能夠作充分的準備、我們自己不懂軍事、要來問軍事、我們不懂進退的關係、拚命要問進退、來責備政府、懷疑政府、大則亂國策、小則亂人心、其禍害所及、當不可設想、我們現在祇有自己準備、大戰開始之後、我們要在本位上來、準備一切犧牲、第三·一大職的結果、最後勝利、是屬於我們的一、大戰的過程中、我們的軍隊是要失敗的、因為我們是弱國、我們的軍備、遠不及敵人、所以打敗仗是意中的事、打勝仗是意外的事、我們不要抱過分的樂觀、因為這次敵人、一定要用最大最兇猛的武器來摧殘我們、同時我們也不要悲觀、如果打敗了、不要懊喪、愈是失敗，愈應常有錢捐錢、有力捐力、我們能夠忍得起戰敗、這次是持久戰、要把我們一切所有的貢獻國家、來支持這次大戰這次是消耗戰、我們要以自己小量來消耗敵人所有一切力量、那末最後的勝利、是我們的、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>事實勝於於雄辯</h3>
<p>— 羅才清</p>
<p>羅滿橋事件發生以來，國人日戰，但是包圍在宋哲元氏左右的漢奸，竭力奔走和平，於是喜峰口外曾建國功的宋氏也進退劉谷起來，及至拒絕最后通牒，决心抗戰。則又兩日之間，平津同告失陷，佟趙陣亡，全國同悲，敵機縱　，不可一世，在低氣聲下呼吸的民案，不禁徬徨失措，兩個問題使他們懷疑着：政府是否决心抗戰，中國是否可戰？</p>
<p>這種懷疑政府的態度，是我們的恥辱，但是我們可以原諒，與同情的，亦“愛國心切”之故也。因之，以管見所及，為我愛國同胞對這兩個問題作一簡單的解釋：</p>
<p>宋哲元退守保定之日，蔣委員長發表第二次談話，內有“所有平津軍事失敗問題，不與宋事，願山余一身負之，余自信必能盡全力負全責，以挽救今后之危局。……况軍事上一時之挫折，不得認為失敗，而且平津戰事，不能算為已經了給，日軍旣蓄意侵略中國，不惜用這種種之手段，則可知今日平津之后役，不過其侵略戰爭之開始，而决非其戰爭之結局，國民只有一致决心，共赴中國難……”</p>
<p>潘公展先生在文化界救協會理事會席上致辭，亦有一我們須知此次抗戰，實是中華民族生死的決戰，決非非短時間內或一二次接函所可終結的。現在抗戰已開始，一定一天一天的向前進，……委員長早經指示過絕對不會中途屈服的，諸君看到今天蔣委員長發表的談話，和蔣委員長在盧山談話會中的報告，可見蔣委員長態度之堅决，我們實毫無猶豫之餘地。……但還有人懷疑中央是否有决心，並問着為什麼不發動全面的抗戰，這固然難怪他們，因為他們根本不懂得戰爭，戰爭是國之大事，是兵家專門的大事，非運籌帷幄的專家，如何能懂得戰爭的一切運籌計劃。……到了最后關頭，不戰也是亡國。”</p>
<p>此外孫科先生亦發表“今日華北局勢，到最后關頭，全國人民，周應信任政府，沉着應付，但必須使全國抗敵民氣，能充分發揚，向國力充實鞏固，取得最后之勝利。”汪精衛先生不應求詳，解釋一最后關頭的意義抗敵决心早已明白的昭示，我們如何再能后疑政府的態度·這是第一個問題。</p>
<p>第二個問題“中國國是否可戰”？我們不是軍事專家，自然不能預先去測·平津失陷，果然使人衰氣：不過，這非“戰之罪也。我們使看后方民氣之高漲，人準備爲國犧牲的精神：東北義勇軍的義起，為國后敵；及乎殷石的保安隊的反正，亦建奇功；這全國上下一致的决心，豈不能一戰歟？</p>
<p>懷疑是多餘的，事實勝於雄辯，“中央既已下决心，我們對於軍事不能有懷疑，只有絕對的信仰領袖和政府，只要領袖和政府是在領導我們抗戰”，“不投降，不妥協，不氣餒，不虚驕，全國一致，絕對信仰蔣委員長為統一抗戰的主帥，紿終服從共命令，中國一定能復興的”。</p>
<p>讀者呼聲</p>
<h3>為戰区同胞請命增加我們的救亡力量</h3>
<p>— 邱爲霖</p>
<p>搬家，这種集團式的自相驚擾的搬家，原是夠痛心的，非但把人心弄得惶惑萬分，市面簫條之至，竟然把社會人於混亂狀態腐裏，說得嚴重些，這種搬家是暴露了中華民族的弱點，給敵人知道是一羣無組樣沒訓練的羔羊。可是閘北的市民，處在談虎變色驚弓之鳥的心理中，仍就在炎炎的烈日之下提箱携籠，拖大抱小的鬧着搬家忙，大有非租界不足以安身立命之概：這種事件，我們是不能回情的，認為是可恥的。</p>
<p>然而我們平心靜氣地仔細地把它搬家的原因分析一下，那末，非但要同情它，而且不能非難嚴責他們了。</p>
<p>事實教訓得太多了，不健忘的上海民衆恐怕不難記起“一二八”時的一幅慘傷圓吧！閘北居民所受到的損失不可計數，甚至有為了戰後不能生活而輕身自殺者淪落為丐為妓的不知有多少呢？那時有誰來替這般無幸者想辦法呢？那末，在風聲鶴唳的時候，呌他們安安靜靜的住在戰區裹，一些沒有戰事的準備，難道叫他們靜等事件發生，受飛機大砲的洗禮，而粉身碎骨嗎？也可說是身許掌國，為國犧性嗎？</p>
<p>目前我們的天津被敵機轟炸，又是一個極有力的證明，日軍在律市這種野獸行為，誰都要憤怒的，成千的居民被機槍掃死，甚至有砍去首級，其他殘酷行為更不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>這是無謂的犧牲，雖然在非常時期，死原是不怕的，不過我們要如趙登禹，佟麟閣，那樣英武悲壯地抗戰而死，不𫗻像成羣的羔羊一般任人亂殺。</p>
<p>總之：中日的生死大戰，是不可避免的了，上海敵人欲造成嚴重狀態，是隨時可能的，我們要防止戰爭發展時的無謂犧牲，當然也不是搬家可以，我們要做戰前的種種準備，最要緊的要使市民個個知道憂護國家的重要性，那末非利用宣傳不可，一方可使市民深深地了解人民封國家的愛護信仰，同時可減少戰時發生後的江北司令部和維持會的醜態演出·對於宣傳工作，可以從如卜幾點着手，如戰時的種種常識，組織防空，避彈，警報，便衣放峭，消防，嚴防漢奸混入，軍事訓練等工作，對於在戰時如何輸送婦孺入安全地帶，如何和軍隊合作，如何築防彈地穴，如何救護受傷者，都要使居民深切的認識，在短期內使以訓練，反正我們要救國不一定是要上前線去服務的，後方工作繁多，有在需要人來組織和領導，領導負責做救亡工作的人們不要忽略了這一點，大家應該馬上起來做這種工作。我們要減少無謂的的犧牲，那末非把閘北居民訓絲起來不可。我們已經知道現在的是全中華民族的抗戰，那末不運用民衆的力量起來抗戰，光是住在安全地帶，發發宣言，是不夠的，我希望負責救亡者，深切注意之，起來組織之。</p>
<h3>戰之歌</h3>
<p>— 水沫</p>
<p>沒有退路了啊，</p>
<p>火光映照得天空也血紅了。</p>
<p>城市着了火，黑煙捲䑛了天，槍聲，砲聲，硫黃彈到處燃燒了。在各處胃噴出火熖，熊熊地延燒着，屋樑的倒場，受場者的呻吟，難民的哀哭，孩子們的驚啼……幾條的哀哀地在撥着焦碎的瓦碟。</p>
<p>大風吹迫了沙子，</p>
<p>烏鴉慘呌向天涯飛去。</p>
<p>猙獰的敵人，</p>
<p>正在殘酷地屠殺了。</p>
<p>在陰溝裏，在負落裹，在街頭，到</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>處是無辜人民的死屍呵，敵人在殘暴地大屠殺了。架起的機關槍，向着老媪，病人，孩兒……掃射着，一排排的難民倒　下去，他們連豬也不如，被當做靶子殺戮，他們是没有罪，他們已遭了難，還讓刺刀，子彈，結束了生命。</p>
<p>縱火，殘殺，轟炸……</p>
<p>仇敵不會終止它的暴行。</p>
<p>黑夜來臨了，</p>
<p>憐火像星星樣的礫着。</p>
<p>在泥溝裏淌流我們戰士的熱血，在曠野裏暴露着勇敢戰士們的死骸，他們在生前，悲壯地抗戰着嗜血的魔王，阻止着一羣羣瘋狂底野獸的侵略，把肉體建立起新的長城，保衛祖國，保衛着人民，……他們悲壯忠節的死了，雖是他們不再呼號，没有鼾聲，不作聲響，可是——</p>
<p>他們在精靈—閃閃的燐火啊，</p>
<p>在指示出我們焦去的路喲。</p>
<p>戰鼓響了，</p>
<p>我們不再聽任敵人的宰殺了！</p>
<p>不再聽任敵人割斷我們咽喉，佔據我們的命脈，讓子彈在耳邊呼呼發響，讓砲火在身旁炸裂，再不能退讓了啊，我們没有回去的路了，——勇壯的戰死，總比慢慢宰割好，於其讓仇敵蠶食，侵蝕，那還是我們勇敢的抗敵好，……</p>
<p>没有退路了啊！</p>
<p>衝！殺！我們前進吧！</p>
<h3>滬西漕河涇遊民習勤所參觀記</h3>
<p>— 蔣逸凡</p>
<p>近年通都天邑，各慈善國，多有乞丐收容所或貧民習藝所等之設置。上海一埠，游民乞丐𢋟集，遠較他埠為多，而滬西漕鎮之上海辦現習動所，其規模亦最稱宏大，且自最近華僑巨商胡文虎先生捐建單人宿舍，專收容富康家之墮落子弟，不但為此等墮落青年前途露一綫之曙光，且為不幸父兄目前唯一解急之救星，誠國中所絕無而僅有之慈善機關也。記者久耳其名，今次旅行來申，藉友人介紹，乃得於七月十九日親往該所參觀。該鎮交通尚便·自上海南市老西門，每小時卽有一班公共汽水直接開往，歷半小時卽到。自大門進行，恍若置身一大公園中，風景殊佳。由吳主任直喃親山招待，引導參觀，屋字多西式，寬廠整潔。吳主任和藹誠懇，每引至一處，必詳為講解。先引革紡紗塲，由織襪廠，木作塲，印刷塲等而出。吳主任言工塲中最稱完備者，為織機塲，有價值昂貴之外國機器，乃全工塲中之精華，然時近午刻已收工，不及引觀為歉云云。工塲中工作者，均一律剪光頭，穿着青布制服，肅靜整齊，秩序甚佳，吳主任聞記者在長沙湘稚發明新式衛生廁所，般股探詢究竟，挺為該所將來廁所改良之準備，吳主任之熱心衛生設備，卽此可見一斑，最接引至胡文虎先生捐建之單人宿舍，乃一排青磚之西式房間，據云已牧容二十九人，須由其家屬自願預繳三年膳費及特別捐共三百十六元，方允收容。為保存收容人之顏面起見，故謝絕外賓人內參觀，諸收容入，雖呲隣各估一室，然彼此嚴密隔離，不許見面，恐若輩之惡習慣互相傳染也。室內人除獨自食睡外，亦許看書籍，並須做工，各在在室中捲棉紗云。（未聞教以他手藝）</p>
<p>記者參觀畢，所得印象大致稱好，然尚有懷疑者數點：收容者或為無家之乞丐，或為富家公子，雖背境歷絕，然有其共同之點。則均為失業之游民是也。有所授習工藝，應擇其適合於現代之切需，可獨立謀生，簡單輕易，不須巨大資本者，方為實用。例如修鐘錶，修汽車，西裝裁縫，接電綫，接自來水管，裝無綫電之收音機等，倘所內專設大規模之工塲，需要價值巨萬之舶來機器，則若輩一旦出所，無同樣之大工廠收容工作，仍無謀生之機會矣。豈非不免於失業，有違設置本所之目的乎？吳主任言家長願送不肖子弟入所訓練者，須一次預先繳清三百十六元，倘中途逃逸或保釋出所，則餘款卽充公云云。該所絕對拒收銀行之支票，或郵政歷票，亦不許將三年費用，分期繳納，即慈善家樂意州助者，如寄銀行支票，卽退同不收云云，故凡家屬願送子弟入所者，必須隨身挾帶一大捲鈔票，前往交付。富翁願捐助善舉，亦必須冒險隨身挾大捲之鈔票前去，方不致見拒，不料上海金融現代化之地，尚有此等收款泥古之機關，洵堪驚異。吳君又言，凡三年期滿出所者，往往環境改易，故態復萌，或墮落更甚，其家屬不得已仍拘送入所者，亦頗有其人，故效騐難覩，未免遺憾云去。吳君心地忠實，不妄稱功績，故說實話，至堪欽佩。又見該所大門首揭一啟事日，凡來賓參觀者，請勿作獎飾語，只歡迎切實的批評云云。記者僅提議改良各點如下，㊀凡單房收容人，在家庭雖曰不肖子弟，而在有專門學識者眼光中，卻為研究之好材料，故應與上海各大學教授（如社會學，優生學，（遺傳），心理學及罪犯學等專門學者）有相當之聯絡，歡迎若輩來所研究，並參考若輩意見，通告收容人家屬，傳作相當之糾止辦法，㊁期滿出所，不應如監獄之以徒刑年限為標準，應改為以習會一種能自謀生活之技藝為最低限度；㊂租界銀行林立，可指定委托一行，代收各種款項，解决支票付款問題，來所接治者只須交付銀行所出之收條為據；（近來各地學校均指定銀行代收學費辦法相似）㊃由所中主任介紹各不幸家長會而組成籌捐委員會，則諸家長均關切身利害，必樂於從事也。（文責自負）</p>
<h3>注意大門上的鐵環</h3>
<p>— 方執中</p>
<p>方執中前天（卅一日）際云君的大作“大門上鐵環失竊”，發表之後，因此勾動了我的好奇心，也目擊過人家最近失竊門環之事，初不以為意，現在給際云君的吶喊，一言道破悶葫蘆，頓時領悟了另有作用。不是嗎？本市抗敵後援會將通告各市民，將“廢銅爛鐵”妥為保藏，勿圈小利，川賣資敵。而五金業也自動查究銅鐵私運出口，豈知一般宵小，在此中日交戰緊張之際，見廢銅爛鐵有利可圖，專竊石庫門弄堂里門上的鐵環，賣給北四川路華人所設的舊貨店中，而這店又作×人在唆使着的。</p>
<p>前幾天，我所住的弄堂里，連有三家發見門的鐵環，已不翼而飛，大家做當是宵小偷去賣給舊貨攤上的，倒也不十分注意。不料第二天早上，又連續發見七家，同時失竊，至此乃始知卽此等小漢奸夜間活動所致。</p>
<p>上月我友陳君，曾為予告：“南市石皮弄及金家坊幾處，門上裝有銅環鐵環，一時被竊者，亦屢見不鮮，而南市房屋，多歷純粹中國化者：例如墻門上的銅環，俱質料上秉之白銅黃銅鑄成！白銅環大者，每付價須六上元；黃銅籥者，亦須三四元”。故一般小漢奸，都視為利藪，我們必須嚴厲的緝防。</p>

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Discuss Protection of Chinese Nationals in Japan</h3>
<p>Order Nationals to Concentrate at Various Seaports; Send Ships to Japan to Transport Them Back to the Country</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to diplomatic circles, the number of Chinese nationals registered in Japan is originally more than 8,000, including approximately 3,000 from a part of the Four Northeastern Provinces, and more than 5,000 are mostly students studying in Japan. Most of them have returned to the country during the summer vacation, followed by small-scale merchants. The only unknown part is a small number of students who did not register when they arrived in Japan. Their places of residence are mostly in Japanese cities or commercial ports, which is different from the situation of Japanese nationals scattered in our interior. Currently, Japanese nationals in our interior, such as Chongqing, Shashi, Yichang, and Jinan, have either returned to their country or gathered in Qingdao and Hankou. Those in urban commercial ports have not yet moved back. The government is extremely concerned about our nationals in Japan. Relevant agencies discussed the protection of nationals in Japan at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the afternoon of the 3rd. Vice Minister Chen Jie replied that the Japanese consulates and nationals in our interior are currently withdrawing to their country. Places such as Chongqing have been completely evacuated, and the concessions have also been handed over to the local Chinese government for safekeeping, but places such as Hankou and Shanghai have not yet been evacuated. Our consulates in Japan have not yet considered evacuation because most of our consulates are located in major commercial ports in Japan. In the future, if Japan withdraws its consulates stationed in our major commercial ports, we will consider the situation and handle it accordingly. There are more than 5,000 Chinese students registered in Yan Du's office in Japan, not including self-funded graduate students. They are currently returning to the country one after another. As for the nationals, the number is large, and most are small-scale businesses. It is not yet known whether they can return to the country at the same time. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed the embassy to provide all kinds of conveniences. As for the news from Sichuan and Vietnam, I have only read about it in the newspapers and have not received any reports. Ambassador Xu has not telegraphed to mention this matter. When the Japanese military attaché Zuo Fang visited, I inquired about it, and he replied that he did not know about it either. Perhaps it is a kind of speculation from the outside world. Ambassador Xu's wife's funeral will be handled by her family, and Xu will not return. Finally, talking about the future of China and Japan and the international situation, Chen said that the international community's moral sympathy for us and the unity of various governments and people are a great comfort to us spiritually. (3rd, special dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Tianjin Soviet Consulate Robbery: The Soviet Government Lodges a Protest with Japan</h3>
<p>Demanding the Arrest of Criminals and Compensation for Damages; Tokyo Officials Deny Any Japanese Involvement</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet government has instructed its Chargé d'Affaires in Japan to protest to the Japanese government regarding the intrusion into the Soviet Consulate in Tianjin by White Russians on Sunday. The Soviet government demands the immediate arrest of those who intruded into the Soviet Consulate, the return of all items that were seized, and additional compensation. As Tianjin is currently occupied by Japanese troops, the Japanese government should be held responsible for this incident. According to sources in Tianjin, the Soviet Consulate was unoccupied on Sunday and lacked any protection. Suddenly, a group of White Russians and others intruded into the Consulate and stole a safe containing documents. A man hiding in the courtyard witnessed the White Russians transporting the stolen items away in a truck. (3rd, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Russian Consulate in Tianjin was ransacked by White Russians yesterday. The government has today instructed its Chargé d'Affaires in Japan to lodge a serious protest, as the Soviet Union believes, "The Japanese government should bear full responsibility and demands a satisfactory reply." It is reported that the Soviet Union is demanding the arrest of the criminals, the return of the stolen items, and compensation for the damage to the Consulate's buildings. (2nd, Kuomin News dispatch)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that, according to official reports from the Tianjin and Beijing areas of China, the situation in North China seems slightly calmer than in the past few days. American authorities there are mostly engaged in relief work. As for the rumors of a Japanese bombing of the former German concession, these have not yet been confirmed and probably have not been carried out. (2nd, Kuomin News dispatch)</p>
<p>[Moscow] According to information obtained by TASS, after receiving a report that the Soviet Consulate in Tianjin was forcibly entered by White Russian bandits and Japanese personnel on August 1st and a large amount of property was stolen, instructions were immediately issued to the Chargé d'Affaires in Tokyo to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese Foreign Minister. Because Tianjin was effectively entirely under Japanese military control at the time of the incident, the Soviet government believes the Japanese government should bear full responsibility. The Soviet protest included three concrete demands: ❶ Immediately arrest the troublemaking bandits and severely punish them, some of whose names are known and have been notified to the Japanese side; ❷ Immediately return the stolen property from the Consulate and compensate for the losses from the damage; ❸ Immediately take necessary measures to protect the Consulate. (2nd, TASS dispatch)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Regarding the Japanese looting of the Soviet Consulate in Tianjin, the Soviet government has recently lodged a protest with the Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Mamoru Shigemitsu, and has instructed the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Japan to lodge a simultaneous protest with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo. The protest note demands that the Japanese government immediately punish the perpetrators and provide compensation for damages. Semi-official sources have recently released the names of Japanese and White Russian individuals involved in the looting and stated that the Soviet Consul in Tianjin immediately sought a meeting with the Japanese Consul after the incident, but the Japanese Consul refused to see him. People here generally believe that this matter may lead to serious consequences, but they say that while the Soviet government will find ways to ensure its rights are respected, it still aspires to peace. (2nd, Reuters dispatch from Harbin via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Officials here claim that the intrusion into the Soviet Consulate on August 1st was clearly the work of White Russians and those who had disagreements with the Soviet Consul, and that it has absolutely no connection to Japanese authorities or Japanese people. The Soviet Consulate is located in the Third Special District, formerly the Russian concession. The Japanese authorities in Tianjin have neither the right to protect the Soviet Consulate nor the responsibility to protect it under international law. If the Russian Consulate can determine the location of its lost items, then the Japanese authorities can cooperate with the Soviet authorities to try to recover them. As for protecting the Consulate, the Japanese authorities are willing to dispatch some troops to undertake this task if requested by the Soviet authorities. (3rd, Reuters dispatch via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Ambassador Shigemitsu visited the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on the afternoon of the 2nd to explain the following two points regarding the attack on the Soviet Consulate in Tianjin: First, the Consulate is located in the former Russian concession, an area not under the control of Japanese troops. Second, the city was in a state of chaos due to fighting, and White Russians took advantage of the situation to act arbitrarily. All those who intruded into the Consulate were Russians. Based on the above reasons, Ambassador Shigemitsu dismissed the Soviet government's requests for punishment of the perpetrators. As he left the Commissariat, the Ambassador told people that the so-called destruction of the Consulate was a planned action by the Japanese intelligence services and was a completely fabricated rumor against Japan. In short, this case is nothing more than a struggle between Red and White Russians, and the Japanese government has no relationship with or interest in Russian disputes. (2nd, Domei News dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The League of Nations Consulate in the Third Special District of Tianjin was destroyed by Japanese plainclothes troops and White Russians, who took away documents, etc. The Soviet Ambassador has protested to Japan that the Third District of Tianjin was long ago returned to our country and is entirely our territory. He has sent Melar, the Secretary of the Embassy, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to relate the detailed course of the destruction. (3rd, special dispatch)</p>

<p>"I went to North China last time because I needed to observe the situation on the ground. Afterwards, due to the outbreak of incidents, transportation was inconvenient, so I was delayed in returning to Shanghai. The North China problem, since the Langfang Incident, has developed into a comprehensive problem for China. Those of us engaged in diplomacy must strive to resolve this kind of incident peacefully. Whatever the outcome may be, we should do our best. I plan to take a convenient ship to Shanghai tomorrow. Whether I will go to Nanjing immediately or after the 4th or 5th, I have not yet decided." Furthermore, the Ambassador is scheduled to take the Qingniao Maru to Shanghai tomorrow at noon. (3rd, Domei News dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan Steals from the Military and Makes War; House of Representatives Passes Tax Increase Bill</h3>
<p>Totaling 400 Million Yuan; Various Taxes Increase by 10-20%</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese government has now submitted an emergency tax increase bill to the Diet, which is estimated to generate 102 million yen in total revenue to be used entirely for military expenses in North China. All corporate profit taxes, income taxes, and capital taxes will be increased. The corporate profit tax will increase by 10%, the income tax by 7.5%, and the capital tax by 5%. New taxes of 20% ad valorem will be levied on musical instruments, cameras, movie cameras, phonographs and their accessories, and jewelry. The Japanese government will also submit a supplementary budget bill within a few days, requesting approval to raise 300 million yen for military expenses in North China. The Diet was originally scheduled to adjourn on August 7th, but it will be extended by one or two days due to the government's supplementary budget bill. (3rd, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government has decided to submit a temporary tax increase bill of 100 million yuan at the special Diet session. All sectors of Japanese society sympathize with the government's move, considering it unavoidable. According to financial and banking circles, since the government has decided to deal with North China with a fixed policy, the expenses will naturally be huge. However, if all expenses are covered by public bonds, it would not be a good strategy given the current financial and monetary situation. It is reasonable to seek part of the funds from tax increases. According to industrial circles, the expenses for the North China incident should be paid from public bonds, and the tax increase bill could be submitted to the ordinary Diet for careful deliberation. However, since the government submitted it to the special Diet session for urgent and unavoidable reasons, it is imperative to actively support the government's policy because of the extraordinary times. As for the impact of the tax increase on the business world, companies that maintain high dividend distribution rates, such as textile and insurance companies, will inevitably see a decrease of about 2%. However, these companies have accumulated internal reserves in recent years, so they will not be greatly affected. Both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have not expressed opposition to the government's tax increase bill. However, some believe that the tax increase bill should be based on a permanent financial plan and a separate temporary Diet session should be convened to discuss this issue. According to the views of party leaders, the current situation is serious, and rather than spending time discussing the detailed methods of tax increases, it is better to strive to unify national opinion and enable the government to implement its established policy. From this perspective, although there will be some debate on the government's side, the result will be at most the attachment of several conditions of hope, and the government's tax increase bill will be approved. The House of Representatives is expected to pass it, and the House of Peers will have no problem. (3rd, Domei News dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The plenary session of the House of Representatives opened at 1:44 PM and presented the first and second supplementary budget bills and the supplementary budget bills for various special accounts, totaling four items. After Budget Committee Chairman Kadoya Naota reported on the process and results of the budget general meeting, discussions began. After several people, including Kijura Sanjiro, briefly stated their hopes from the floor, the entire assembly unanimously approved the original plan. (3rd, Domei News dispatch)</p>
<h3>Far East Situation Affects British Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Possible Mediation of Sino-Japanese Disputes; German Newspaper Praises Chamberlain</p>
<p>[Berlin] The Deutsch-Italienische Korrespondenz recently published an editorial praising the new direction of British foreign policy and also lavishing praise on Prime Minister Chamberlain personally. The rapprochement between Britain and Italy has further freed Europe from "Soviet interference." As for the recent note sent by the British government on the issue of a future West European pact, it proves that the Spanish problem is no longer the sole focus of European attention. The newspaper also stated, "This move by Britain is due to the situation in the Far East. At present, Britain does not believe that its vital interests in the Far East are threatened. What Britain wants is to reach a final agreement with Japan. As for the negotiations between the British government and Japan, they have not broken down, but have only been temporarily suspended. In addition, Britain is also striving to solidify its economic position in China. Therefore, Britain may one day agree to act as a mediator between China and Japan."

<h3>Eden Invites Italy and Germany to Mediate the Sino-Japanese Conflict</h3>
<p>Great Astonishment in London</p>
<p>[Moscow] According to a TASS correspondent in London, who obtained absolutely reliable information from British political circles, British Foreign Secretary Eden has proposed to Germany and Italy that they jointly mediate the Sino-Japanese conflict. This news has caused great astonishment in London. Germany is Japan's ally, and both Germany and Italy have long been interested in inciting all international disputes, even trying to instigate various conflicts from time to time. This source also specifically pointed out that during the recent conflict on two small islands in the Heilongjiang River, Germany and Italy had strongly encouraged Japan to go to extremes, hoping to complicate the situation in the Far East as much as possible.

<h3>American Professor Criticizes Japanese Behavior in China</h3>
<p>—Calls It Shameless and Stupid—</p>
<p>[New York] Dr. Kilpatrick, the world-renowned Professor of Philosophy and Education at Columbia University, told reporters today that Japan's behavior in China is truly shameless and stupid. The destruction of Nankai University in Tianjin will not make the school disappear. The result of the brutal means of the Japanese military bombs is only enough to make this famous school immortal. This kind of terrorist policy of the Japanese military will not only fail to protect Japan's interests, but the land that Japan has acquired by force will eventually be returned to its original owner and will ultimately belong to China. Furthermore, Japan's view that creating war is a way to expand trade is absurd and illogical. Bombing Nankai University students, who are the ruling class of the future, is absurd and illogical. In short, in my opinion, Japan's current actions are only enough to make China's will to resist Japan more consistent. Japan will soon express regret for this atrocity. We can wait and see.

<h3>Sugiyama Reports on the Tongzhou Incident</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Army Minister Sugiyama reported on the Tongzhou Incident in the House of Peers on the 3rd. The contents are as follows: The Jidong Security Force had always shown goodwill to the Japanese side. When the Japanese army disarmed the 29th Army outside Tongzhou City on July 27th, they cooperated with the Japanese army. They also acted together with the Japanese army when attacking the Chinese army in Dagu. Tongzhou usually had 110 Japanese residents and 180 Korean residents. A small number of Japanese troops were stationed there for defense. However, when the North China Incident broke out, the number of residents increased to 380, while the number of Japanese troops was only about 100. At around 3:00 AM on July 29th, the Japanese Tongzhou troops were suddenly attacked by the Jidong Security Force, numbering about 2,000. They surrounded the garrison and cut the power lines. The Japanese garrison guarded the barracks and warehouses, and a part of the army repelled the attacking army. However, by 10:00 AM, the enemy had increased artillery and launched a fierce bombardment, causing partial destruction of the barracks. At noon, an enemy shell hit a gasoline tank loaded with ammunition-filled trucks. As a result, the gasoline caught fire, and the gunpowder exploded, burning for three hours. At that time, the main force of the Japanese army was fighting in the Beijing area. Upon receiving the report of the Tongzhou troops' bitter fight, the army commander immediately dispatched air force to assist. After the air force bombardment, the attacking army was silent for a while, but in the evening, they still surrounded the Japanese barracks and continued shooting. On the 30th, the army commander learned that the attacking force in Tongzhou was the Jidong Security Force. He immediately ordered the Kayashima unit, which was fighting in Nanyuan, to rush to Tongzhou. The Japanese garrison, with the assistance of this reinforcement and the air force, launched a counterattack. The Kayashima unit arrived in Tongzhou at 4:30 PM on the 30th, attacked the remaining enemies, and occupied the city gates. However, due to the weather and terrain, it was inconvenient to send people to investigate the situation of the Japanese residents. It was not until the 2nd that the staff officers went to investigate by plane and learned the truth. According to their report, the Japanese residents were scattered in their homes throughout the city at the time. Due to the suddenness of the incident, they were attacked by the enemy. The number of those killed seemed quite large. On the 2nd, a total of 124 residents were rescued, and 130 corpses were found. The whereabouts of the others are unknown. (3rd, Domei News dispatch)</p>

<h3>Reports on the Soviet Purge Affecting the Navy and Air Force</h3>
<p>Thousands of Army Officers Replaced, Many Communist Youth Commit Suicide</p>
<p>[Moscow] It is widely rumored here that many members of the Communist Youth League and the aviation sector have been arrested, or committed suicide out of fear of punishment. It is reported that General Shiriping, commander of the "Independent Aviation Group," and General Bormunan Cai Fu, president of the Air Force School, have been arrested. Li Bo Ke Angnuo, secretary of the Executive Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Fan Bo, the representative of the Soviet Communist Youth League to the International, have both committed suicide out of fear of punishment. As many as 26 members of the Executive Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Youth League have been expelled from the party. In addition, many members of the Communist Youth League have been labeled as "enemies of the people," most of whom are journalists, it is said. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the Soviet purge, the local morning newspaper recently reported that nearly officers in that country have been arrested or declared missing recently. These include two military district commanders, five army commanders, twelve brigade commanders, over two hundred colonels, and over two thousand junior officers. Marshal Voroshilov, the People's Commissar for Military Affairs, although reluctantly accepting the dictates of the dictator Stalin in political matters, could not condone this kind of organized sabotage. He has claimed illness and refused to preside over this massacre and has also relinquished his position as chairman of the Red Army Purge Committee, which will likely be filled by Yezhov, the People's Commissar for Internal Affairs and head of the political police. The newspaper reported that Stalin is still carrying out the purge. Recently declared missing are Naman, director of the Third Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, i.e., the West European Department, and his assistant Wen Pei'er. The Figaro reported that it is rumored in Moscow that Krylenco, the former chief prosecutor of the People's Commissariat for Justice, has been arrested. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas)</p>
<p>[Paris] A correspondent for the Morning Post in London recently declared that, according to Moscow dispatches, Béla Kun, the leader of the Hungarian Communist Party, has been arrested. However, official circles here have no knowledge of this. It is noted that Béla Kun was the chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Hungarian Communist Party. After the failure of the 1919 revolution, he fled to Soviet Russia and is now a member of the Executive Committee of the Third International. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Rumors are circulating that several more high-ranking generals of the Soviet navy and army have been arrested, including Admiral Orlov, Deputy People's Commissar for the Navy, Admiral Rosdorov, Commander of the Pacific Fleet, General Kesseling, former Commander of the North Caucasus Military District, and Colonel Boroson, commander of a tank regiment in the Ukrainian state. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet Central Executive Committee recently ratified the appointment of Poti Dangfu as Minister of Public Health by the People's Committee. No news has been heard of former Minister Commissky after his dismissal. Rumors are circulating that he has been arrested. It is noted that Commissky is the fourth Soviet People's Commissar to be dismissed in this manner. (3rd, National Maritime Telegraph)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The International Situation and All-Out Resistance</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Japanese imperialists have always taken advantage of favorable international circumstances when invading China. This was certainly the case when the September 18th Incident was launched, and it is still the case with this attack on Lugouqiao, the occupation of Peiping and Tianjin, and the attempt to annex the entire North China region. They are seizing the opportunity when the international situation is favorable to Japan's aggression. The main aspect of this is that in Europe, Germany and Italy are poised to take advantage of the military development of the Spanish rebel forces to overthrow the rule of the legitimate government of Valencia in one fell swoop, forcing Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries to devote all their efforts to deal with it, leaving them no time to pay attention to the flames of war in the Far East. At the same time, the conservative British government's pro-Japanese attitude, the beginning of Anglo-Japanese negotiations, and the vigorous implementation of the purge within the Soviet Union are all seen by the military as good opportunities to invade China. Thus, the sound of gunfire at Lugouqiao signaled the start of Japan's military invasion to annex the entire North China region, and even the whole of China.</p>
<p>Because the current international situation is quite favorable to Japan's aggressive actions, when the war first broke out, many countries hoped to localize the Lugouqiao Incident and not allow it to expand. Britain, in particular, which has provided the most help to China's economic construction in recent years, has taken an even more explicit stance. If we were to advocate waiting because of this, and fail to launch an all-out resistance against the planned and large-scale invasion by Japanese imperialists, then we would be making a grave mistake. Such a myopic view would be detrimental to the future of our resistance and must be corrected.</p>
<p>First, Japan's current invasion is a planned and large-scale invasion that aims to annex more than just the entire North China region. Therefore, for this aggressive action that endangers the survival of our nation, we have no choice but to launch an all-out resistance. Moreover, Japan's invasion is taking advantage of a favorable international situation. If we also wait because of the international situation, then we will be falling into Japan's trap, which will inevitably lead to the entire nation becoming slaves of Japan.</p>
<p>Secondly, because our country learned from the September 18th Incident, when it relied too much on foreign aid and adopted a policy of non-resistance, resulting in the loss of vast amounts of land, it has been shouting the slogan of "self-reliance" for several years. We no longer harbor great hopes for international support. Therefore, the current evolution of the international situation cannot prevent us from launching a resistance to preserve the survival of our nation.</p>
<p>Thirdly, although the current international situation is not very favorable to the future of our resistance, the international situation is constantly changing. We can use our own strength to transform the international situation and develop it into a situation that is favorable to us. The first step in transforming the international situation is that we must resolutely strike a comprehensive blow against the invasion by Japanese imperialists, so that they cannot easily create a fait accompli to be used as an excuse to prevent other countries from intervening. Only after we have launched an all-out and sustained resistance can we win international sympathy. For example, when the incident first broke out, Britain had hoped to localize the war and resolve it quickly. However, later, because of Japan's relentless advance and the valiant resistance of our army, Britain no longer had any hope for Japan and stopped the ongoing Anglo-Japanese negotiations. Although Britain's attitude still hopes that the war in North China will not escalate, when our launch of all-out resistance and Japan's aggressive actions further damage Britain's interests in the Far East, Britain will certainly not stand idly by. The situation in Britain is like this, and the same is true for other countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the current international situation can be changed after we launch an all-out and sustained resistance. Secondly, we must take active diplomatic action to transform the international situation to our advantage. In the past, because we focused too much on "self-reliance," we did not have good relations with countries that sympathized with us, resulting in a rather isolated diplomatic position. In fact, in the context of increasingly complex and close international relations, even strong countries are desperately seeking allies (such as the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany, the formation of the Axis by Germany and Italy, and the mutual assistance pacts signed by France). All the more so for our weak country. Although we have not paid much attention to this in the past, we can still proceed quickly now. The allies we are looking for are of course Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries in the democratic camp. As long as we have a firm determination to resist, it will not be difficult to find allies. In particular, the Soviet Union, which is connected to us, because Japan's invasion of China is an indirect threat to its security. If we resolutely resist, it will not abandon us, its ally. This has been clearly explained in President Sun's talk on the 30th of last month. Therefore, if we take active diplomatic action as soon as possible, the international situation will also be transformed to our advantage.</p>
<p>Finally, although the current international situation is favorable to Japan's aggressive actions, it is very different from the situation during the September 18th Incident. This is because the Soviet Union's Far East military strength has increased even more than before. Britain is more clearly aware of Japan's aggressive ambitions than during the time of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu. And the Roosevelt administration hates the actions of aggressors even more than President Hoover. Therefore, as long as we launch a resolute, sustained, and all-out resistance, and at the same time take active diplomatic action, the current international situation will change quickly. If we are still worried about the current international situation, listen to the deception of some imperialist diplomats, and do not immediately launch an all-out resistance, but only wait for an opportunity, then there is only a dead end.</p>
<h3>Signs of a Shift in the European Situation, Britain and Italy Repair Old Ties</h3>
<p>Mussolini Replies to Chamberlain, German Newspapers Also Express Satisfaction</p>
<p>[Rome] The increasingly close relationship between Britain and Italy can be clearly demonstrated by Mussolini's reply to Prime Minister Chamberlain's personal letter of reconciliation. Mussolini's reply was delivered to Chamberlain today by the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi. The content has not been made public, but it is widely believed that the wording is very good. People here believe that Anglo-Italian relations have gradually returned to their old friendly footing. People are inquiring one after another whether there will be concrete steps following the exchange of letters between the two prime ministers. At the same time, Berlin expressed satisfaction with the increasing closeness between Britain and Italy. Newspapers there hope that the results obtained can have a comforting effect on the overall international situation. It is all due to Chamberlain's active diplomatic policy. A Berlin newspaper stated that Europe now recognizes that the future of Europe lies not in the competition between various different political systems, but in the cooperation between the old and new systems. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] The Italian Ambassador Grandi paid a visit to Prime Minister Chamberlain at 3:00 PM today, personally handing over the reply from the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to Chamberlain. The conversation lasted forty minutes. British political figures believe that this conversation is extremely important in nature. In the coming days, either a British cabinet member will visit Rome, or an Italian cabinet member will come to Britain to repair relations. Furthermore, according to sources from the British side, Mussolini's reply expressed appreciation for Britain's willingness to promote friendship with Italy and stated that the Italian side also has the same desire. British sources said that the letters exchanged between the British and Italian leaders are of a general nature, but because they are private correspondence, they will not be published for the time being. It was also said that during today's conversation between Prime Minister Chamberlain and Ambassador Grandi, all the points contained in Chamberlain's letter to Mussolini were discussed in detail. Britain insists that the Italian government should recall the two divisions of troops recently sent to the Libyan colony in North Africa and disband the troops concentrated on the border between Libya and British-Egyptian Sudan. Only then can closer ties between Britain and Italy be realized. In response, Ambassador Grandi replied that the recent visit of the British Minister of the Navy, Sir Hoare, to the Mediterranean also made Italy feel uneasy. It is generally believed that the withdrawal of the two divisions of Libyan troops to Italy is unlikely to be realized in the short term. In addition, Ambassador Grandi has roughly agreed to stop the anti-British propaganda of the Italian newspapers and the radio station in the city of Bari. Finally, the issue of maintaining the status quo in the Mediterranean, especially the Spanish island of Majorca, was also brought up for discussion. Regarding this, Ambassador Grandi only made vague promises, saying that it can only be implemented after the end of the Spanish Civil War. In British official circles, it is believed that the various promises made by Italy should be fulfilled. In short, whether a West European pact can be established and whether Britain, France, Germany, and Italy can hold a meeting in London in October to ease the West European situation depends on Italy's attitude. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)</p>
<h3>Negotiations for a West European Pact Looming</h3>
<p>Relevant Countries Are Exchanging Opinions, Whether a Meeting Can Be Held in October Is Still Undecided</p>
<p>[Paris] The British government is now striving to get closer to Italy. Britain recently sent another note to the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, advocating for renewed negotiations on a West European pact. French political figures expressed a positive response upon hearing the news and believed that if the tense situation in Western Europe could be eased, the Spanish question would naturally be easier to resolve. The French government will support the British view but attaches two conditions: first, after Britain and Italy implement closer ties, Italy should completely stop interfering in the internal turmoil in Spain; second, the establishment of a West European pact should not allow countries harboring aggressive intentions to act freely in Central and Eastern Europe. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] When someone asked an official figure whether Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, would hold a meeting in London in October to discuss a West European pact, the official figure replied that he knew nothing about this. Responsible sources said that the recent exchange of letters between the British and Italian Prime Ministers focused most on the Mediterranean issue but had no connection with the negotiations for a West European pact. However, well-informed sources in the British Parliament still believe that Foreign Secretary Eden will go to Rome to meet with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to prepare for the future negotiations between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. As for Belgium, because the British and French governments recently issued a declaration approving the lifting of the obligation to guarantee neutrality stipulated by the Locarno Treaty, it is not necessary to have them participate in the negotiations. (3rd, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the reconciliation between Britain and Italy, the Morning Post recently published a commentary, saying, "The exchange of letters between British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has no connection with the negotiations for a new Locarno Pact that Britain, France, Germany, and Italy should conduct. Whether these negotiations can be conducted in the autumn of this year is also questionable. In short, unless the situation in Spain changes drastically, there will be no room for these negotiations to proceed. In addition, British and Italian cabinet members have not planned to meet in London. If the Italian government sends a representative to attend the 18th ordinary session of the League of Nations General Assembly in September of this year, then British Foreign Secretary Eden can meet with Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano."

<h3>Spanish Rebel Forces Bomb Capital Vigorously</h3>
<p>Fifty Killed</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid Madrid was subjected to the most violent bombardment in months after midnight, with approximately fifty people killed or injured. During the final hour of the bombardment, as many as twenty shells per minute fell. When the bombardment began, rescue teams went out to serve, but were hampered by dangerous conditions. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>⊙ Oviedo Government forces today used bombers as a vanguard to attack rebel forces deeply entrenched in the ruins of Oviedo, hoping to cut off the rebels' communication. The defense works here are extremely solid. At key locations, between the ruins of walls, there are concrete buildings, which are connected to each other by tunnels. If government forces occupy Mount Escambello, they can look down from a high position and wait for the rebel forces here to be wiped out. However, the rebel forces have also abandoned the lowest defense line and retreated towards the foothills. (2nd, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>German-Austrian Relations Still Fraught with Discord</h3>
<p>Pan-Germanism, Austria Resists</p>
<p>[Paris] Political figures now fear that German Head of State Hitler will take advantage of Britain and France being fully focused on the Spanish question to take action in Austria, forcing the Austrian Schuschnigg government to hesitate between two paths in the near future. The so-called two paths are: either allow many members of the Austrian National Socialist Party to join the cabinet, or openly fight for Austrian independence. At present, an anti-Pan-Germanism movement has emerged in Austria. This movement is led by the Vatican and may receive the support of Britain and France. It is noted that Head of State Hitler had already given Ambassador Papen, stationed in Austria, until the end of August to use negotiations to make the Austrian cabinet concede to Germany and accept the demands made by Germany, but so far, there is no hope of this being realized. Therefore, Germany's attitude has hardened, which can be evidenced by the following incidents: first, an Austrian choir paid respects to Head of State Hitler in Bad Pyrmont, Germany, yesterday, shouting the slogan "One People, One Nation"; second, during the recent meeting of the Joint Committee of the two countries established according to the German-Austrian Agreement of July 11 last year, the German representatives took an unusually strong stance. Conversely, Austria is also preparing for large-scale resistance. The Vatican has been encouraging Catholics in various Austrian patriotic groups to cooperate with the Christian Social Party and the laborers of the Social Democratic trade unions for some time. Several leaders of the trade union faction have written to Prime Minister Schuschnigg, expressing their willingness to cooperate with the government to "save the Austrian motherland." From this, one can see a glimpse of Austria's anti-Pan-Germanism movement. Not only that, this movement to resist Pan-Germanism has now expanded to the countries in the Danube River basin. As far as Yugoslavia is concerned, it has approved the concordat signed with the Vatican on the one hand, and strengthened the alliance between France and Yugoslavia on the other. Moreover, there have recently been two incidents that are sufficient to prove the cold attitude of Yugoslavia towards Germany: first, the German side protested and opposed the speech recently given by General Nedic, the Chief of the General Staff of Yugoslavia, in Venden, France; second, when the Orthodox Church leader of Yugoslavia, Varnava, was recently buried, the Yugoslav government and diplomatic corps did not participate, but the German Ambassador to Yugoslavia participated in the funeral procession, and Varnava, before his death, gave an interview to a German newspaper reporter, praising the "Third Reich" and National Socialism, all of which are sufficient to arouse the resentment of the Yugoslav government. However, if the movement to resist Pan-Germanism does not have the backing of the major Western European powers, it will still be futile and useless. France is considering that, after Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt visits Paris and London, Britain and France may as well issue a joint declaration on guaranteeing Austrian independence.

<h3>League of Nations Makes No Resolution on Palestine Question</h3>
<p>[Geneva] After lengthy discussions on the report of the British Committee, the League of Nations Mandates Commission has decided not to make a report either for or against the partition of Palestine for the time being, but agreed to state the advantages and disadvantages of the following five possible solutions: (1) maintaining the existing mandate; (2) modifying the mandate; (3) dividing Palestine into several districts according to the Swiss federal system; (4) partition; (5) any other solution obtained through negotiation. Yesterday afternoon, the Mandates Commission held a closed meeting, and the English Colonial Minister Ormsby-Gore questioned everything for a long time. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Reuters)</p>

<p>European Correspondence</p>
<h3>Who Exactly is the Air Force Elite?</h3>
<p>— By Our European Correspondent, Lieshan</p>
<p>The Results of Experiments in the Spanish Civil War</p>
<p>It is an open secret that the major powers are taking advantage of the Spanish Civil War, using the front lines of Madrid as testing grounds for their own arsenals. Perhaps both sides feel logistical difficulties in terms of quantity and are unable to supply as much as they would like; however, in terms of quality, all countries are unsparing in bringing out their latest military aircraft, especially air force weaponry. According to British and American military correspondents inspecting the Madrid front lines, the air force occupies a very important position in this Spanish Civil War. Almost every gain or loss of a position depends entirely on the success of aerial bombing. In the recent large-scale counteroffensive by the government forces in Madrid, the two sides often used one to two hundred aircraft daily in aerial warfare. Bombers, fighters, reconnaissance planes, all types are fully equipped. Because this is a large-scale experiment, it is no wonder that various countries have sent air force experts to inspect in Madrid. (Here, we hope that domestic military authorities will also send one or two air force attachés to Spain.) After a year of practical testing, the aircraft manufacturing industries of various countries will naturally make further progress. That is to say, future world wars will be even more tragic!</p>
<p>The main countries supplying aircraft and air force personnel to Spain are France, Russia, Germany, and Italy. As to who exactly has the air force elite, according to most British journalists' criticism, the Soviet Russian products are the most sophisticated, the French and Italian are also good, and the German aircraft are the worst. However, the German air force personnel have excellent morale in combat, thus compensating for the weakness of the aircraft.</p>
<p>Recently, a French aviator (who joined the government forces as an air squadron commander after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War) published an article based on his practical experience. His statement may not be without some subjective elements, but from it, we can get some truth about the Spanish air war. He believes:</p>
<p>Germany's Air Force: Personnel Better Than Machines</p>
<p>This statement of his is generally correct. During the last European war, Germany's first military aircraft was manufactured by imitating a downed French aircraft. The machinery is cumbersome. If the Germans did not have good military spirit, they would not have been able to resist the enemy's air force at all. In the past twenty years, the German aircraft manufacturing industry has certainly made amazing progress, but it has never been as refined as France, Italy, and other countries. In the skies of Madrid, the characteristic of the German Air Force still lies in the fighting spirit of the air force soldiers. This author said: "The Germans have an amazing fighting spirit and tenacious endurance. If you encounter a German aircraft, then you will understand that after a major battle, one of these two enemies will certainly not survive." He admits that the Germans have a calm attitude in aerial combat. Usually, if his plane is slightly affected by artillery fire, he cannot shake his courage at all unless he himself is injured. This author has personally shot down two German fighter planes. However, he politely said that it was his luck, and he also had to give credit to the fact that his aircraft was superior to the German Heinkel.</p>
<p>Italy's Air Force—Machines Above Men</p>
<p>This author's criticism of the Italian Air Force is far less polite than his criticism of the German Air Force. He said that the Italians often adopt the method of "running away is the best policy" at critical moments. However, he said that the Italian Air Force is much better than the Italian infantry.</p>
<p>Italian air force personnel have undergone long-term training and are very proficient in modern air warfare methods. Italian aircraft are also superior to German aircraft. However, the Italian Air Force still occupies a secondary position in General Franco's army. The reason is that the Italians do not seem to have as much perseverance as the Germans. When the two sides engage in aerial combat, they immediately show panic, and their usual excellent skills disappear completely at this point. As the machine gun fire becomes more and more urgent, their combat effectiveness becomes weaker and weaker. In the end, they are either shot down or forced to land, or they open the throttle and flee back. According to the author's experience, he said: "Of course, there are exceptions. Some Italian pilots also have the courage to fight to the end, but they are very few."</p>
<p>Soviet Russia's Air Force—Personnel and Machines Both Wonderful</p>
<p>According to this author's criticism, the Soviet Russian Air Force is the most outstanding in the skies of Spain. He said that it is a fact, not propaganda for Soviet Russia. In many air battles, the Soviet Russian Air Force has shown their ability everywhere. A Soviet Russian aircraft usually encounters seven or eight German and Italian fighter planes, and may be shot down because of the "disadvantage of numbers", but the Soviet Russian air force personnel fight to the end. They will not give in easily. Sometimes in this unfavorable situation, they will also achieve the final victory.</p>
<p>He believes that the first and most special thing about the Soviet Russian Air Force is the aircraft. Soviet Russian products are far superior to those of Germany and Italy, whether in terms of speed or altitude. Secondly, the Soviet Russian air force personnel are all very proficient in combat techniques. An average 29-year-old pilot has an average of 2,000 hours of flying experience. Those around 30 years old have even more than 3,000 hours of flying experience. Therefore, they have absolute confidence in their piloting skills. Especially the accuracy of firing machine guns. Everywhere, it makes the enemy tremble. Again, they also have a spirit of not fearing death and can calmly respond to battles. This author said that the Soviet Russian air force personnel, at least like the Germans, are first-class soldiers.</p>
<p>He felt that the only unfortunate thing was that Soviet Russia supplied too few aircraft to the Spanish government forces. Compared with the ratio of aircraft supplied by Germany and Italy to General Franco, the ratio is one to six. This means that one Soviet Russian aircraft has to fight six or more German and Italian aircraft.</p>
<p>France's Air Force</p>
<p>Perhaps because the author is French, he did not mention a word about the French Air Force's achievements in Spain. According to some observers' estimates, the strength of the French Air Force seems to be above that of Germany and Italy. The author's own achievements are an example. As early as half a year ago, the French Minister of Aviation, Pierre Cot, also publicly stated that France's latest aircraft were very safe and reliable on the Madrid front lines, and that only the old French aircraft were shot down. Perhaps in fact, the number of aircraft supplied by France is limited, so until today, we have not been able to obtain detailed materials in this regard.</p>
<p>Spain's Air Force</p>
<p>Spain's original air force not only had a limited number, but also the aircraft were purchased from foreign countries. And most of them were old-fashioned. It was not until after the outbreak of the civil war that both sides received help from their backstage bosses and began to organize a modern air force using foreign machines and personnel. Germany and Italy on one side, France and Russia on the other. Spaniards, on the contrary, occupy an unimportant position in the Spanish air war. According to the author's report, on the government forces' side, only one Spanish pilot, piloting the latest Soviet Russian aircraft, shot down 15 Franco aircraft. On Franco's side, only one Spaniard used an Italian aircraft to shoot down ten government forces' aircraft. The remaining Spanish air force personnel are currently still in training, and it is too early to talk about special achievements.</p>
<p>In addition, what deserves our attention is that the latest anti-aircraft guns are still very limited in their effectiveness. The percentage of aircraft shot down by anti-aircraft guns is very low. Based on the results of the Spanish air war experiment, this author's conclusion is: using aircraft to deal with aircraft is still the most effective air defense method.</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Come to Lu for Reconnaissance of Transportation</h3>
<p>Flying Over Several Times a Day and Strafing Our People</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: For days, Japanese telegrams have dispatched aircraft to reconnaissance along the Pinghan and Jinpu railway lines. One day at about 8:00 AM, a Japanese aircraft flew from Tianjin to Dezhou, circled high for a week, and then left. On the same day at about 10:00 AM, another Japanese aircraft flew to the Huangheya Station north of the Pingyuan Station on the Jinpu Railway. A Jinpu train happened to be heading north. The Japanese aircraft immediately flew low and used machine guns to strafe the train. Passengers on the train got off. The Japanese aircraft had already flown north. At about 2:00 PM at noon, two more Japanese aircraft flew from the north and flew low when they reached the Dezhou Station, also shooting at the station, injuring three people, who were taken to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, a Japanese aircraft also flew over Jinan, circled high for a week, and then flew away. At 3:10 PM, another Japanese aircraft flew from the north and flew east after reaching Pingyuan. It is found that the purpose of the Japanese aircraft's reconnaissance in Lu is entirely focused on transportation. The people in Jinan are stable and peaceful everywhere. (1st day)</p>
<h3>Anhui Industry and Commerce Discuss Various Preparations for Wartime</h3>
<p>Detailed Discussions on Transportation and Finance</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Anhui industrial and commercial groups, in view of the tense situation in Hebei and the impending extraordinary period, convened a joint meeting to discuss ways to cope with wartime. The Huaiji County Chamber of Commerce convened a joint meeting of various industry guilds at 8:00 PM on July 30 to discuss and resolve the following measures: 1. Each industry guild shall, within a short period of time, accurately investigate and list the number of people currently employed in each shop and report it to the Chamber of Commerce in order to properly organize and cope with the needs of the war. 2. During the national crisis, food is particularly important. The industry should be responsible for investigating and statistically determining the amount of stock and surplus of food and report it to the Chamber of Commerce on a旬basis. If there are any shipments out or transfers to neighboring areas, a certificate from the local Chamber of Commerce in the purchasing area must be obtained and reported to this Chamber for registration. Only after investigation and verification can it be transported, but it must not be privately connected to the enemy. It should also be presented to the county government and military and police authorities for strict inspection. 3. The responsible persons of each industry should encourage merchants to voluntarily do what they can to comfort the soldiers fighting bravely against the enemy on the front lines with materials or finances to show their patriotic enthusiasm. 4. Daily necessities, such as firewood, rice, charcoal, coal, oil, salt, paper, miscellaneous grains, cloth, etc., should be investigated and statistically determined by each industry guild to determine the amount of stock and surplus, with the standard being sufficient for half a year's use in the city. If there is an insufficient supply of goods, they must be purchased quickly to avoid a sudden shortage and panic in the market. 5. Stabilizing the market finance, adjusting it appropriately, and balancing prices to maintain the order of the business community is the main task. The above cases were unanimously approved and communicated to various industry guilds to be handled immediately. (July 31)</p>
<h3>Fengxian Foreign Protection Seawall: Japanese Draw Maps and Take Photos</h3>
<p>Japanese Warships Moored at Sea, Five People Landed</p>
<p>Fengxian Correspondence: It is confirmed that at about 10:00 AM on the morning of the day, five Japanese landed at the outer protection seawall area about 20 to 30 miles from Qianjiaqiao Town in this county (approximately in the Niulangba area). One person kept watch, two held guns, and the other two drew maps and took photos along the foot of the seawall. When local farmers learned of this and went, the Japanese had already left on their original sampan. Only from afar, it seemed that warships were moored on the outer sea surface. Now, County Magistrate Yu Xilai, in order to prevent future troubles, has specifically ordered the coastal township police to organize watch posts and dispatch security teams to garrison important coastal areas at any time to pay attention.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Writings from Rural Hubei</h3>
<p>— Cheng Jun</p>
<p>Wuxue Commerce and Strange Customs</p>
<p>Wuxue is an important commercial port in the lower reaches of Hubei Province. Goods from Qichun, Huangmei, Guangji, Yangxin, and Duanchang in Jiangxi enter and exit through this place. There are steamships from companies such as China Merchants, Taikoo, and Osaka docked here. Although Jardine Matheson and Sanbei do not have steamships, they can still load and unload goods by boats. There are also small steamships traveling to and from Huangshigang, Qichun, Jiujiang, Fuchikou, and other places. There are buses on land to the county seat, which is very convenient for transportation.</p>
<p>The value of exported goods used to reach over 5 million yuan per year, but now it is only half that. The main product is ramie produced in Yangxin, Daye, Qichun, Guangji, and Huangmei, which is transported here. The ramie shops process it and then sell it to Jiangxi, Hankou, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and even overseas. Whenever new ramie comes on the market, merchants from all over come here to sit and collect it, and even Japanese merchants come here to buy it. The market is extremely lively. Unfortunately, in recent years, bandits have been rampant in various counties, and roads have been blocked. Products from Yangda and other counties have mostly been transported to Hankou for sale via a detour. In addition, the ramie shops' processing methods are too simple. Even the water for bleaching ramie is not paid attention to, and often sewage is used to bleach it, resulting in a less pure color. Sales are also sluggish because of this. The second is cotton, which has also decreased in exports due to banditry in the producing areas and cannot flow smoothly. Moreover, they do not know how to select seeds and cultivate them for improvement, so half of the sales are taken away by American cotton. Furthermore, there are grains and tobacco leaves. Rice is the main product of Guangji, with an annual yield of about 400,000 dan, which is transported here for sale. Rice from the northwestern townships of Huangmei is also transported here in large quantities. Now most of the rice from Huangmei is diverted to Jiujiang via Xiaochi, so the rice transport in this city has also decreased slightly. In addition, Huai salt in eastern Hubei has always used this place as a general hub for transit. Because the sales of refined salt have been increasing daily, while the sales of Huai salt have been decreasing, counties such as Huangmei and Qichun have all switched to eating refined salt and transporting and selling it themselves, without having to pass through this city. Therefore, the commerce of this city has gradually declined. There used to be more than twenty money shops, but they have closed one after another, and economic panic has been increasing daily. Now the provincial bank has a branch here, which slightly adjusts it, but compared to the past, it is not the same. The city also has specially made handicraft products, such as palm ropes, camphor wood boxes, shell-ground buttons, and cast iron-cast tripods. Camphor wood raw materials come from Yangxin, which are used to make boxes and plants to avoid clothes moths.</p>
<p>The people are fiercely rebellious. Among the prisoners in the court, those who committed murder account for one-third. They are rich in adventurous nature. Many people go to Harbin and the islands of Southeast Asia to work as barbers, and often return home with wealth.</p>
<p>There are many strange customs. Three are briefly described. On the night of the fifteenth day of the first month, every household burns smoky incense in the chamber pot, and then ignites firecrackers and smokes rice straw, which is called "removing filth." On the second day of the second month, they raise funds to worship the God of Earth, set up a feast for revelry, and call it "doing the land meeting," which is more important than the New Year. Young men and women often get married on this day without choosing another date. On the eighth day of the fourth month, various monks and nuns go from house to house to "send black rice," which is to dye rice with a certain kind of tree leaf to make it black, saying that cooking and eating it can avoid disasters. The strangest thing is "collecting souls" and "protecting ten". Collecting souls is when a patient is dying or has been ill for a long time, and it is thought that the soul is lost. Then they invite Taoists to the house, invite many strong men to come, carry the statue of the general to the middle, hold ⼽ to the shoulder, sound gongs and drums, and gallop around on all sides, saying that they are shepherding the patient's soul, and the disease can be cured. In addition to this city, Longping and Tianjia Town are also popular. There is a local ballad that says, "Wuxue Longping, collects souls every day, if you still don't believe it, there is Tian Town." If the gods are spiritual, they should be tired of running around. Those who "protect ten" are when men unfortunately see women urinating, or a woman's hand accidentally hits their head, they think it is sharp and unfavorable. Therefore, they discuss with ten relatives and friends to come forward and issue a memorial to ask for God's protection, which is different from ordinary crimes that require guarantors. They burn the memorial, and then the ten people raise money to hold a banquet at the host's house, so that they think the filth is completely removed. There is also one thing that is very inhumane. Women who are widows, if they want to re-marry, cannot write their marriage contracts in the house, but must go to someone else's field shore to write it bitterly. They use tiles instead of inkstones, and saliva instead of water. After writing, they throw the pen and ink on the ground. If the field owner sees it, he will also think it is unlucky and drive them away. Women cannot go out through the main gate when they are about to leave, but must go out through the wall like a stone dog or a snake. All kinds of embarrassment are not to encourage chastity, but merely caused by superstition, which is really absurd. It is heard that this custom has been slightly reformed recently.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Hurricane and Rainstorm Strike</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, there has been little rainfall in this county, and agricultural crops have been greatly affected. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 2nd, a hurricane blew from the Wenzhou sea and swept over Songjiang, with intermittent showers. In the evening, the wind became even stronger, and the weather turned cooler. The wind was even stronger on the morning of the 3rd. Many electric wires in the city were broken by the wind, and the wind has not weakened yet. It is really rare in recent years.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>

<p>At about 2:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, a fire suddenly broke out at the house of Yuan Mingzhang, a squatter in the Huangtingtou area of Dafan Road outside Xumen. Because the wind was quite strong at the time, although the fire brigades drove to rescue the fire, the effect was minimal, causing the fire to spread to about 70 neighboring grass sheds. It was not until 3:00 AM that the fire was extinguished, leaving about two hundred poor residents homeless and miserable. Yuan Mingzhang, who caused the fire, was arrested by the police station in charge to investigate the cause of the fire.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Gold Prices Soar Uncontrollably</p>
<p>There are more than 80 silver shops in this county, and more than ten, such as Yang Qinghe, have a larger scope of management. Recently, the market price of gold in various shops has suddenly soared, rising from 20 yuan per tael to 131 yuan. The reason is that it is affected by the situation in North China. Sea gold (that is, spot gold) has risen due to excessive demand. Therefore, the gold in Xiyi has also risen accordingly. Currently, some wealthy asset holders have rushed to buy and store it. Yesterday, on the 2nd, various silver shops posted prices, rising to 140 yuan per tael, a rise that has occurred in decades. It is predicted that there will still be continued gains within a day.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Yangjing Road Scheduled to Open to Traffic</p>
<p>Wanfu Bridge in Dongxiang, Jiangdu, is more than one kilometer long and is the passage between Xianyang and Kong. Since it was destroyed by Sun Chuanfang's army, travelers have felt inconvenience, and it is especially difficult to change cars here on the Yangjing route. Therefore, a factory plan was made to use steel and cement and build bridge piers to cut off the flow, costing more than 160,000 yuan. It has taken more than a year to complete all of them. It is learned that the bridge has been opened on the 1st, allowing travelers to pass through. However, it is prohibited to pass the bridge by small cars. It is heard that Shen Baixian is scheduled to come to the bridge on the 5th to complete the work and hold the opening ceremony of the Yangjing Road.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Training Rescue Team Members</p>
<p>The various sectors of the Anti-Enemy Support Association believe that rescue work is extremely important. Now, after a meeting of the rescue team, it has been decided to divide it into four groups: rescue, treatment, burial, and accommodation. A rescue training class will be established immediately. Each town in Zone I will assign at least 30 people. The training is scheduled for two weeks to teach rescue work so that they can set off for rescue at any time.</p>
<p>Xihu Car Overturned</p>
<p>The Xihu car drove from Xiyi to Shanghai at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 2nd. It was carrying more than 30 passengers when it arrived at Zhangjiaqiao. Because the front wheel came off, the car overturned inside. Passengers Liu Shunxiu, Huang Duanji, Ying Shouying, and others were injured and sent to Jiangyin Hospital for treatment. The company is compensating for the loss of passengers' luggage.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Nantong Cotton Hit by Severe Drought</p>
<p>The output of cotton in Tong Province has increased this year, and the promotion of improved species has also been smooth. After the beginning of summer, the cotton seedlings developed very well, but in recent months, there has been a severe drought and no rain, and the cotton seeds have been greatly affected.</p>
<p>Preventing Tidal Disasters Along the River</p>
<p>The Jiang'an area of Tongyi Yaodong has collapsed greatly. Recently, there has been a sudden storm and the river tide has risen sharply. The various embankments along the river are deeply afraid that the tide will pour in. They are currently recruiting laborers to build embankments and taking turns guarding all night.</p>

<p>In the last ten days of last month, there were two wandering monks who claimed to be from Hangzhou, one old and one young, who first raised money in the county and then went to the shore of the north bank of Jianhe in the 3rd district to raise money. They must go to the countryside to rest at night, which is suspicious. Also, on the 31st of last month, a medicine seller came to Wangying. He was wearing a suit and leather shoes. He spoke casually. The district office of the area learned of it and took a tour together. Monks were taken to the county government for interrogation. Also, in the seven bays in the city, which used to be the hiding place for prostitutes, the police of the first branch of the Huaiyin police station went to the place on the 30th and saw one with a suspicious look. They immediately took what they said and transferred it to the general drink. It is said that the person is suspected of being a traitor.</p>

<p>Bandits Shoot Dead Principals</p>
<p>Lu Dajia, a farmer in Pingxiang Township, District 8 of this county, was suddenly attacked by more than a dozen bandits the night before, all holding short guns, intending to rob. Lu's second son bravely resisted and was shot dead. His mother was also shot in the right shoulder and was in critical condition. Also, Wan Jianzhang's family in Fangle Township of the district was also robbed the night before. Because he shouted loudly for help, the bandits opened fire and hit Wan's second son's knee. When four heard the news, Fu Mingluo opened fire and the bandits went west, losing more than a hundred yuan.</p>

At 7:30 PM on the evening of the 2nd, four traitors were working on the broken soil at the intersection of the two tracks near the Xidayang Bridge in Fengjing. When the road police saw it, they stepped forward to inquire, but the traitors refused to inquire, took out their hands and threw bombs, and the road police immediately ran away, blew their whistles to gather the team, and fired a shot into the left rib of one of them, and the bullet came out of his back. Companions were frightened, the injured traitor swam to Yuanyi in the river, and was captured by a certain company commander who went into the water. However, he refused to tell the truth, and there was no way to know the truth. Sulfur bomb grenades were copied around his body. He was temporarily detained for a night on the 2nd, and on the morning of the 3rd, he was escorted to the Jia与 District Security Command by a military doctor.

<h3>Pacific Hurricane Hit Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Customs Hung Balls and Fired Cannons as Warning; Air and Sea Traffic Were Blocked; Many Houses Collapsed and Signboards Fell, Injuring Many People; Hurricane Reached Ningbo at 6 PM</p>
<p>Starting from the 31st of last month, the third hurricane of this year (according to previous reports, the first two had dissipated) from 20 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude in the Pacific Ocean blew towards our coast for days. Yesterday afternoon, it crossed Hangzhou Bay. The wind direction was northwest by west, and it hit Shanghai at midnight. The impact on Shanghai was that there were strong winds and heavy rains all day yesterday, and air and sea traffic were blocked. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reports from the Observatory</p>
<p>According to reports from the Xujiahui Observatory, the hurricane was at 38 degrees north latitude and 123.5 degrees east longitude at 6 a.m. yesterday morning. At 10 a.m., it advanced to 29 degrees north latitude and 121.5 degrees east longitude. At 4 p.m., it advanced again to 19.5 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude. The waves in Hangzhou Bay were strong. The center of the southeast wind force over Ningbo was extremely strong. The wind direction was originally north-northwest and northwest yesterday morning, but suddenly turned to northwest by west in the afternoon and hit Shanghai's southwest area at midnight. The observatory also issued a report at 9 p.m., saying that a violent hurricane was moving northwest by west and reached Ningbo at 6 p.m. The center point was approximately 30 miles within 20 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude in the area biased towards the northwest of Hangzhou Bay and Shanghai. The wind was still strong.</p>
<p>Customs Hung Balls and Fired Cannons as Warning</p>
<p>The Yangtze River downstream and the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Jiangsu were affected by the hurricane, causing violent cyclones and showers. The Bund was affected the night before. By yesterday morning, the wind had become stronger. The Jianghai Customs Clock Tower hung two black balls and fired three warning cannons at 8:45 a.m. yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Air and Sea Traffic Were Suspended</p>
<p>All shipping companies complied with the customs warning, and all ships to and from the Yangtze River and the outer seas were suspended from leaving the port. All sea vessels originally scheduled to enter the port yesterday were also anchored midway and could not enter the port. Only three ships on the Yangtze River route, the Jiang’an of the China Merchants Bureau, and the Daqing and Zhide from Tongyang to Shanghai, braved the dangers and sailed to Shanghai via the Yangtze River. All flights of China and Eurasia Airlines were unable to depart, and air and sea traffic was almost completely paralyzed.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Impact on Shanghai</p>
<p>The wind was very strong in the city all day yesterday, so there were many impacts and losses. The details are as follows: Many trees along the roads in the French Concession's Route Tenant de la Tour, Rue Massenet, the Public Concession's Xiaoshadu Road, and Connaught Road were uprooted by the strong wind and flew high into the sky before falling down. Fortunately, there were few pedestrians and no accidents occurred. At the same time, due to the strong wind and heavy rain, the tram lines and company machinery in the French Concession were obstructed from 2 p.m. yesterday, and the current was interrupted. Most trams were temporarily suspended. It was not repaired until more than an hour later. A similar situation occurred at about 4 p.m. When the wind was strong, many rickshaws overturned. Although cars were able to drive with difficulty, their speed was greatly reduced. In addition, billboards on Sichuan Road, Avenue Edward VII, and the Racecourse were blown down. Electric wires and lights on Ningbo Road, Jiangxi Road, Suzhou Road, and Fujian Road were blown down. Houses collapsed and people were injured on Ningbo Road, Jiangxi Road, Avenue Edward VII, Chengdu Road, Zhejiang Road, Park Road, Taiping Road, and Tangshan Road. Flagpoles were broken at the Museum Road and Yuanmingyuan Road. Chimneys were blown down at Yangshupu, Zhoushan Road, Yufeng Yarn Factory, Waibaidu Bridge, and the Astor House. There were more than 100 cases of bamboo fences being blown down and flying bricks injuring people. In one case, an electric wire was blown down on Suzhou Road and Fujian Road, and a passerby was electrocuted to death. In another case, at the entrance of Fuanli, Shuanglongyuan Street, Gaochang Temple, South Shanghai, at 10 a.m. yesterday, an electric wire was blown down by the wind and fell down. A beggar, about 40 years old, happened to be passing by and was electrocuted to death on the spot.</p>
<p>Commercial Losses Were Extremely Significant</p>
<p>Yesterday, the hurricane hit Shanghai, coupled with heavy showers. The city’s commerce also suffered a great impact. Because most citizens stayed indoors unless necessary, the business of major companies was sparse. The calling trade business in the Shiliupu area, which usually relied on passing pedestrians to purchase goods, stopped calling out yesterday. In particular, the cold drink shops were deserted. The temperature yesterday at noon fell from 100 degrees to below 80 degrees, like early autumn. The cold drink stalls along the street were also ignored. It is estimated that the loss in one day was tens of thousands of yuan. However, taxis and rickshaws were three times more profitable. Also, yesterday, the price of vegetables in the city soared due to the hurricane, which drastically reduced the supply.</p>
<p>Barges Capsized and Goods Were Lost</p>
<p>During the strong wind, most of the ships in the Huangpu River had stopped to take shelter. Only the British India Steam Navigation Company’s China-England route mail ship Kashii Maru, which was docked in front of the Kung Wo Hong Wharf to load cargo, had a barge carrying many pieces of cargo, intending to unload it onto the ship. Unexpectedly, the wind and waves in the river were unusually strong. The barge could not withstand the impact of the wind and waves and capsized. All the goods in the ship fell into the water, resulting in a small loss. Fortunately, the boatman was rescued. The damage was already very significant.</p>
<p>Large Trees Were Uprooted by the Wind</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the hurricane passed through the city, in addition to the impact on air and sea traffic, according to a reporter from the China East News Agency, the large tree opposite the junction of Route Joffre and Rue de la Grotte police station was blown down at 4 p.m., uprooted and lying across the tram tracks. The tree was then removed by people, and the tram was able to pass. It was also said that two trees in the courtyard behind the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road were also blown down by the wind. In addition, many antennas of households in the city equipped with wireless radios were broken by the wind.</p>
<p>All Silk Factories Stopped Work for Half a Day</p>
<p>The Industrial Association said that when the hurricane hit Shanghai yesterday, accompanied by storms, the glass factory doors and windows of silk reeling factories in northern Shanghai were mostly damaged, resulting in cold air penetrating into the factories. The silk temperature could not be maintained. They were forced to suspend work in the afternoon. Signboards of shops on various roads were also blown down by the wind. The tide of the Suzhou River rose sharply, with raging waves. Also, the walls of Changrongli, Hengji Road, were blown down by the wind. Fortunately, it was raining heavily at that time, and there were no pedestrians, so no accidents occurred. A large number of thatched sheds in Pingchi areas such as Yutong Road, Jinling Road, Jiaotong Road, Sun Temple Road, and Tanziwan were blown down by the storm. As of the time of publication, the wind was still unabated.</p>
<p>All Standard Clocks Stopped</p>
<p>The city's standard clock stopped yesterday due to the impact of the hurricane and the interruption of the circuit, causing all the sub-clocks in the Wan’an and Zhabei districts to stop. However, due to the wind and rain yesterday, repair work could not be carried out, so the clock faces in various places were temporarily covered. As soon as the wind weakens, repairs will be carried out. It is estimated that the standard clock will be fully restored today.</p>
<p>Wusong Was Affected Both by Land and Water</p>
<p>The intensity of the wind and rain at the Wusongkou yesterday was unprecedented in recent years. It had become a storm. The sea level rose sharply, as high as the shore. Low-lying areas along the Zhou Tang became a swamp. Roof tiles flew all over Wusong Town. The sheds made from lead sheets and reed mats were all destroyed. Poles and lines along the Outer Bund were in a state of chaos. The telephone suddenly went out of service in the morning.

Local authorities sent personnel to inspect the embankment and prepared to rush to repair the project. The reporter went to Fort Taiwan in the rain at 1 p.m. yesterday. Remotely, he saw that the outside of the port was full of haze and white waves were overwhelming. Because he was attacked by wind and rain, it was difficult to stand on the seawall. He turned back midway and took a car back to Shanghai. The sound of wind and rain roaring outside the car window did not abate. Because the Song District is located on the coast, it is more violent than Shanghai.</p>

At the juncture of the life and death of the Chinese nation, peace has long been hopeless, and only resistance can survive. In addition to uniting as one, women must actually take on the work before and after the front line. Encouraging men to be loyal and brave in killing the enemy can indeed generate great strength.

<h3>Traitorous Merchants Sell Grain to the Enemy</h3>
<p>In order to prevent the enemy from acquiring grain, the city’s miscellaneous grain industry has already decided to stop trade with North China and strictly prohibit transportation to Dalian, Yingkou, and other places. At the same time, a sales investigation committee and a detective team were organized to prevent traitorous merchants from smuggling. However, general rice shops and flour and wheat stores are quite profitable and sell large quantities of grain to the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters in this city at high prices. It is learned that a certain Zhou, who used to work as a runner at the Zhou Yitai Rice Store in Maojialong, Dou City Street, Nanshi, privately sold rice and grain to the Japanese Headquarters on Jiangwan Road. More than 20 stones of rice were required every day, and they were sold at a high price of 18 yuan per stone. Trucks have been loading rice and sending it to the city for many days. The Committee for Investigating the Sale of Grain organized by the Fathers and Grain Industry Association shall conduct a thorough examination of the total daily number of miscellaneous grains arriving in the city, the total number of sales, and the amount of inventory for reference. The association has been sending people to various godowns for detailed investigations every day. It is learned that there are more than 600,000 dans of rice in the city, which is enough to meet the needs of the city’s citizens for half a year. Now, the Miscellaneous Grain Association has decided to hold a temporary meeting at Cuixiutang in Nanshi at 3 p.m. today to further discuss how to effectively prevent traitorous merchants from smuggling to help the enemy.</p>
<h3>The Cultural Circles National Salvation Association Issued a Declaration on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Support the government to launch a national war of resistance</p>
<p>The Cultural Circles National Salvation Association of this city held its second standing council meeting yesterday afternoon. In addition to discussing and determining the association's work outline to promote national salvation work and other major cases, Hu Yuzhi and Zhou Hanmei were also appointed to draft a declaration on the current situation. The declaration is excerpted below:</p>
<p>China has reached the final juncture of life and death. We will live if we resist the war, and we will die if we compromise. Since the Lugouqiao Incident on July 7, the enemy's iron hooves have trampled on Beiping, and the enemy's artillery fire has destroyed Tianjin. The military, political, economic, and cultural centers of our northern China have become new bases for the enemy to further reduce and destroy our China. The enemy's ambition is endless. They want to destroy my large and resource-rich China and destroy the glorious and outstanding ancient civilization of my thousands of years. Now, the whole country, from top to bottom, has determined that it has reached the final juncture. Chairman Jiang firmly stated in his speech on July 17 that it has now reached the final juncture. On July 29, he solemnly stated, "Now that we are in this final juncture, how can we regard the affairs of Pingjin as a local issue and allow the Japanese army to divide and rule, or even create puppet organizations?" At the same time, he called on the whole country to "launch an entire plan, lead the overall situation, fight in unison, and sacrifice to the end to defend the country." Chairman Wang also said in Lushan, "If we don't sacrifice, then we can only be puppets." At the same time, today, all the people of the country, regardless of gender, age, poverty, or wealth, have made the most fervent determination and are willing to unite. Under the great call of the authorities, they will sacrifice to the end to defend the country. For thousands of years, the Chinese nation has suffered oppression and slaughter, and today it can be said to be the most heavy and tragic. Similarly, in the face of the enemy's fierce aggression, the spirit of unity and consistency from top to bottom of my Chinese nation has also been developed most thoroughly and resolutely. Today, the government authorities want to resist the enemy and save the country, and the people of the whole country also want to resist the enemy and save the country. The government authorities have decided to sacrifice, and the people of the whole country have also decided to become benevolent. The government and the people have reached an unprecedented level of agreement today, and they are integrated into one. The government has gained the sincere and enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country and has further consolidated its leadership in the work of resisting the enemy and saving the country. The people have gained the leadership of the government and have further consolidated their unity and developed their great potential strength. The Chinese nation has been fused into a white-hot fireball. He will burn all the enemy's shameless conspiracies and brutal attacks to a complete end. We want to appeal to our compatriots across the country. We want to mobilize a comprehensive war of resistance. There must be a single, strong, and powerful leadership center. We must support and assist this center with a loyal attitude so that it can exert more correct and more powerful leadership. We cannot be pessimistic or disappointed because of local setbacks. We must firmly believe that our sacrifice and resistance will inevitably have the final victory. At the same time, we ask the central government to quickly launch a large-scale war of resistance in the shortest possible time, and immediately organize the people, train the people, and mobilize the people to serve on the front line, or stay in the rear to do planned work. In this way, we believe that the depressed and sad emotions of the people will inevitably be swept away, and what will replace them will inevitably be a vigorous and fleshy atmosphere. Patriotic compatriots across the country, we have reached the final juncture. We have no longer a question of war and peace today, but only a question of how to resist the war. Regarding military affairs, we have our supreme leader, Chairman Jiang, planning everything and mobilizing everything. We will naturally absolutely obey and absolutely believe. However, the current war of resistance is not a local war of resistance, but a war of resistance of the entire nation. It is a war of resistance of a weak country against a strong country. Therefore, there must be a total mobilization of the entire nation. Every citizen must have the determination to die and the great determination of "scorched earth resistance" in order to seize the final victory of this war of resistance. Therefore, the responsibility for this arduous national war of resistance movement is not only on the army. Every Chinese compatriot must shoulder this great mission. Every Chinese compatriot must fight to the end and sacrifice to the end under the dispatch and command of the Supreme Commander of the country.</p>
<p>Fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters across the country, let's stand up. Let us pick up our guns, pick up our hoes, carry our axes, and pick up our pens to fight our national enemies. We must mobilize the nation's manpower, material resources, and intellectual resources to strive and struggle under the grand plan of protracted war and depletion war. We are determined not only to defend North China and recover lost territories, but also to fundamentally extinguish the flames of enemy aggression and forever preserve the peace of the East and the world. We firmly believe that under the command of the Supreme Commander, the implementation of national war of resistance and the implementation of scorched earth war of resistance will surely lead to the final victory.</p>

<h3>General Assembly of the Performing Arts Circle's National Salvation Association</h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan Instructs on Three Points, Jiang Xiaoxiao Reports on Progress</p>
<p>The Shanghai Performing Arts Circle's National Salvation Association, since its establishment, has been actively preparing to jointly face the national crisis. In addition to deciding to hold a large-scale fundraising campaign, it also uses the convenience of its business to engage in propaganda on the essentials of resisting the enemy. Yesterday morning, it held a general assembly of all members at the Penglai Grand Theater, inviting Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan to instruct on propaganda strategies. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Members in Attendance</p>
<p>Including Jiang Xiaoxiao, Liu Chunshan, and over two hundred others. Shan Chen Yuelou, Hu Hensheng, Wang Shaofeng, Liu Ziling, Huang Zhaolin, Ling Youxiang, Jin Xuefang, Li Zhulong, Zhang Binghui, Zhou Hanmei, Wu Zhenlong, Shi Genfu, Shi Chunxuan, Xiao Wenbin, and others served as the presidium. Ni Weiyin recorded the minutes.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After performing the rituals, Hu Hensheng, the chairman, first reported on the purpose of the meeting, briefly stating: The nation has reached its final moment, and everyone must bear the responsibility of saving the country. Our performing arts circle has always been enthusiastic about saving the country, so we organized the Performing Arts Circle's National Salvation Association. Each individual in our performing arts circle must use all their strength to serve the country. Today, we also ask Director Pan to give instructions. We must follow Director Pan's instructions and publicize them to all citizens, hoping that all citizens can make the greatest and final sacrifice for the nation.</p>
<p>Pan's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Director Pan gave a speech, briefly stating: What I want to say today can be divided into three points. First, "If I die, the country will live." Now is the final moment for our nation. This battle must use the power of the whole country and the power of the whole people. Everyone must have the mentality of either living or dying, either having or perishing, to save this greatest crisis. The final victory belongs to us. Otherwise, there is only destruction. Second, "Believe in the government and prepare diligently." Now, the general mentality of people is that our China must fight. We are not military experts. Frankly speaking, I am a complete layman when it comes to military affairs. We must not pretend to be military advisors. If we have outstanding military geniuses, we only need to believe in them, and they will definitely be able to make full preparations. If we ourselves do not understand military affairs and insist on asking about military affairs, if we do not understand the relationship between advance and retreat and desperately ask about advance and retreat to blame the government and doubt the government, it will disrupt national policies on a large scale and disrupt people's hearts on a small scale. The harm it causes is unimaginable. Now we only need to prepare ourselves. After the war begins, we must be in our positions to prepare for all sacrifices. Third, "The result of arduous efforts, the final victory, belongs to us." In the process of the war, our troops will fail because we are a weak country and our armaments are far inferior to the enemy's. Therefore, losing battles is expected, and winning battles is unexpected. We should not be overly optimistic because this time the enemy will definitely use the largest and fiercest weapons to destroy us. At the same time, we should not be pessimistic. If we lose, do not be discouraged. The more we fail, the more we should donate money if we have it, and donate strength if we have it. We can withstand defeat. This is a protracted war. We must contribute everything we have to the country to support this war. This is a war of attrition. We must use our small amount to consume all the enemy's strength. Then the final victory is ours.</p>
<p>Significance of Establishment</p>
<p>After Director Pan finished speaking, Jiang Xiaoxiao reported on the preparations, briefly stating: This time, the Performing Arts Circle's National Salvation Association was urgently established to cope with extraordinary events. I hope everyone will unite and follow Director Pan's speech to fulfill our responsibilities. The meeting adjourned without shouting slogans.</p>

<h3>All Sectors of the City Are Actively Raising National Salvation Donations</h3>
<p>The Banking and Currency Industries Notify All Villages to Contribute Enthusiastically; The Leather Goods Industry Advocates a One-Dollar National Salvation Long-Term Donation</p>
<p>Financial Sector: The banking and currency industries in the city, in view of the country's many difficulties and the tense situation in North China, in order to show the cooperation between the government and the people in defending the country and resisting the enemy, are willing to make efforts to donate and solicit patriotic donations, so that the industrial and commercial sectors can also contribute. According to the Industrial and Commercial Society reporter, the financial sector of Shanghai is the financial hub of the whole country, and major famous official and commercial banks and money houses are concentrated here. Now, each bank and house has accepted the request of the anti-enemy committees of various sectors to collect national salvation donations from various sectors. Citizens are quite enthusiastic in donating. The authorities of each bank and house have decided to automatically donate huge sums of money as an example for all industries. The currency industry association has urged all villages to donate enthusiastically. Each bank has also separately pledged donations, and is also working hard to solicit donations from relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Hardware and Parts Industry: The Shanghai Hardware and Parts Industry Association, in view of the fact that the country has reached its final moment, in addition to organizing a relief and fundraising committee to engage in fundraising, also intends to rush to make clothes and trousers to supply the wounded soldiers at the front. Yesterday, a notice was issued saying: "Greetings, the prelude to the war has been unveiled, and the country has reached its final moment. The people of the country should do their best, contribute their wealth, and do their utmost to jointly face the national crisis. Our merchants rely on a strong country and a safe people to operate with peace of mind. If the country is in difficult and distressed circumstances, and a strong enemy is making progress inch by inch, no matter what occupation, they will not be able to work safely. According to the meaning of 'every man has a responsibility for the rise and fall of the country', it is appropriate to sacrifice the small self to complete the big self. Therefore, we must do our best to support the enemy, so as to increase the courage of the soldiers at the front, strengthen the will of the anti-enemy soldiers, and plan the rear supply and relief of the displaced compatriots. It is our duty to do so. According to the resolution of this meeting, in order to organize a relief and fundraising committee, we have completed the initial national salvation donation, and are rushing to make clothes and trousers to supply the wounded soldiers at the front, and continue to handle long-term donations. All our colleagues and associates are deeply aware of the righteousness, and are able to put the country before the family. We hope that they will generously donate to save the country. It is our great fortune. I hope you will understand."</p>
<p>Leather Goods Industry: The Shanghai Leather Goods Industry Association, in view of the serious national crisis and the preparation work that the people in the rear should have, held a meeting of member representatives at the Dali Chun Restaurant at 7 p.m. last night.

Jin Changwei Wenzhao was elected to be responsible for presiding over the team. ㊂ Collect daily necessities such as towels to comfort the soldiers at the front. Lin Gentu was elected to handle the matter. ㊃ Notify members of the waistband and glove groups to rush to produce products for emergency use.

It was resolved to pass it, and those who pledged to save on the spot were very enthusiastic. Due to time and procedural constraints, Wu Peilin was appointed to go to various factories to universally solicit savings from August, until the end of the resistance. They would donate savings according to their ability, pay them to the association individually, and send them to the central government for national defense purposes. It is also planned to raise huge sums of money from male and female workers of all members to donate and produce gas masks to give to the national defense warriors.</p>
<p>Ant Society: The Ant Society has recently established a branch of the Anti-Enemy Support Association, and is now starting to carry out daily fundraising campaigns and wartime service surveys, Sino-Japanese problem lectures, current affairs forums, and other work.

<h3>Japanese Yarn Factories in the City Ordered to Weave Coarse Cloth from Fine Cloth</h3>
<p>For Use in Rural Belts and Gauze</p>
<p>Japanese-owned yarn factories in the city have been ordered by the Japanese military to re-weave coarse cloth from previously woven fine cloth (this cloth can be used for rural belts and gauze). Chinese workers, driven by patriotic feelings after seeing the coarse cloth re-woven, have voluntarily resigned. The Japanese side, seeing the situation was not good, made grand pronouncements, such as that if any Chinese resigns from August 1, the factory will be closed and no longer tolerated. Chinese workers, after hearing the news, remained stable. On August 1, they took a memorandum to each Japanese factory demanding that the stored wages be settled. Seeing that the plan could not be sold, the Japanese factories were greatly panicked and denied the statement. Therefore, the reason why it is widely rumored that Japanese factories in the city suspended work on the 1st, according to the workers' news, Japanese factories have been working day and night to rush to make the above-mentioned coarse cloth, which seems to be in urgent need.</p>

<h3>Major Fire on North Suzhou Road in Last Night's Hurricane</h3>
<p>Dingji and Tongshang Warehouses All Turned to Ashes; Total Losses Estimated at Around Two Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Xiangqi Weixian warehouse at No. 769, West of Old Garbage Bridge on North Suzhou Road, was built by Dingtai Money House of No. 147, Tianjin Road. Recently, due to the situation, all goods were滞滯. All goods transported to the north were mostly allowed to be stored in Shanghai. Therefore, the three-story准准 warehouse of Dingji was also rented out, and all of them were piled up with piece goods, cotton, silk cocoons, and the total value was no less than one million six or seven hundred thousand yuan. At about 8:30 last night, a fire suddenly broke out on the third floor of the warehouse. When the police and nearby neighbors saw white smoke coming out of the machine window, it was discovered. However, the internal 口” was out of control. In addition, yesterday happened to be a hurricane, and the fire was aided by the wind, and it felt even more unsustainable. In an instant, it burned to Jinzhan. The flames were tall, illuminating the sky red. After receiving the news, the Central Fire Brigade and the fire brigades of the 組口区 each drove fire trucks to the scene and tried to put out the fire. However, due to the strong wind, the direction of the water jet was forced to stop from time to time. Therefore, the fire became more and more fierce, and it even spread to the pile of money at No. 784, Shanghai Commercial Bank, next door. When the reporter left the fire scene at midnight, in addition to the Dingji push warehouse which had all turned into ashes, half of the Commercial Bank's pile of warehouses had also been burned down, and the situation was still increasing. After the firefighters worked hard to put out the fire, it was difficult to predict because the wind was not weakening. It is also learned that the goods in the Commercial Bank's pile of warehouses are also full of warehouses, and the minimum loss, as of the time the reporter sent the manuscript, has reached about one million yuan.</p>
<h3>Improved Pearl Tea Shipped to Shanghai for Trial Sales Overseas</h3>

<p>According to the Railway Bureau's news, in recent days, the three or four class cars departing from Shanghai on both the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines have been extremely crowded with passengers, and the luggage is piled up like mountains. It is said that there are two reasons: One is that Japanese factories in Shanghai have stopped work one after another, resulting in workers losing their jobs and having to leave Shanghai to return to their hometowns; The other is that rumors are rife in Shanghai, and civilians in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas have no ability to move into the concessions with higher living standards, so they have to return to their hometowns as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Can Avoid Cholera If It Safely Transitions This Month</h3>
<p>Cholera Has Been Found in Haikou and Hong Kong; Guangzhou Has Also Been Affected According to Reports</p>
<p>Cholera has been found in Haikou and Hong Kong. Yesterday afternoon, the Greater Tung News Agency reporter learned that it has also been found in Guangzhou. The details are recorded below.</p>

It was said that it would be avoided this year, but it was suddenly found in Haikou in Guangdong Province, and Hong Kong has also been affected at the same time. It is estimated that only a few cases have not reached the situation of an epidemic.</p>
<p>Not to the Extent of Declaring a Plague Port</p>
<p>The so-called epidemic situation requires more than twenty-five cases per day, so the port quarantine office of this port has not yet declared Hong Kong as a cholera plague port, because it has not reached the extent of an epidemic. However, the quarantine office has paid extreme attention to ships coming to Shanghai from Haikou and Hong Kong in order to prevent intrusion.</p>
<p>It is Reported That Guangzhou Has Also Been Affected</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, according to the news from the sputum examination office, cholera was also discovered in Guangzhou. However, the local quarantine station has not yet sent a formal report to Shanghai. The sputum examination office specially sent a letter to inquire, and ordered that a detailed report be submitted immediately, and the patient's feces be sent to Shanghai in a sealed letter for inspection.</p>

<h3>Vegetable Prices Rise in the Concessions</h3>
<p>Due to a Sharp Increase in Population</p>
<p>In the Public Concession, French Concession, and other areas of this city, many small houses in the alleys were previously vacant due to the economic downturn. Recently, due to a sharp increase in population, the aforementioned vacant houses have been rented out completely, leading to a sudden rise in vegetable prices in various small vegetable markets.

<h3>Rickshaw Owners' Cooperative Halted After Collecting Fees</h3>
<p>No Accounts Publicly Released, Those in Charge Accused of Embezzlement</p>
<p>Rickshaw owners, realizing that they had to rely on external contractors for the manufacture of rickshaws, decided to reclaim their rights. On December 10, 1934, all the rickshaw owners held a meeting at the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce and resolved to establish a new rickshaw manufacturing cooperative. In the future, the manufacture of new rickshaws would be handled by the cooperative. At that time, Yuan Songmao and others were elected as the responsible personnel of the cooperative, and it was resolved that every rickshaw owner</p>
<p>with one rickshaw</p>
<p>would have to pay the cooperative 10 yuan in expenses, collected in three installments: 5 yuan for the first installment, 2 yuan for the second installment, and 2 yuan for the third installment. However, only two installments were collected before the collection was stopped. With 10,000 rickshaws in Shanghai, the total amount collected was 70,000 yuan. At that time, rickshaw owner Wan Jingshan also followed the resolution and paid 12 yuan. However, the so-called cooperative has been silent and inactive to this day.</p>
<p>The collected funds</p>
<p>have neither been returned nor have accounts been publicly released. It is generally believed that the responsible personnel have embezzled and enriched themselves. Therefore, Sun Shi'an, a lawyer, was engaged to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing the responsible personnel of embezzlement under Article 335 of the Criminal Law and requesting the return of 51 yuan through a civil lawsuit. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Fengqi of the Second Criminal Court summoned the plaintiffs and defendants for trial, but none of them appeared in court. Only Gu Songmao commissioned</p>
<p>a lawyer to appear in court.</p>
<p>First, lawyer Sun stated the intent of the prosecution, while lawyer Gu claimed that the cooperative had not been approved by the government, so it was later changed to the Shanghai Special District Public Rickshaw Joint Manufacturing Factory. However, because rickshaw owners did not purchase goods from the factory, it closed down within a few months. Therefore, the case is actually of a civil nature, and so on. Judge Zhan, after reviewing the report, announced that the case would be rescheduled for trial.</p>
<h3>Chief of the District Court Lu Yimei Transferred to Anhui</h3>

<h3>Xiang Yixing, Owner of Nanshan Ironworks, Kidnapped Yesterday</h3>
<p>Bandits Left a Note Saying They Would Be in Touch in Three Days, Xiang Was Previously Kidnapped Once Last Year</p>
<p>Nanshan Weaving Factory is located at the intersection of Nanshan Road in Zhabei, and was founded by Xiang Yixing, a native of Ningbo. The business is doing quite well. Xiang's residence is located at 190 Oujia Road, and he has a private car for transportation. Yesterday morning at about 6:40, Xiang took his private car to the factory as usual. However, when the car reached the corner of Feilun Road and Bazhi Road, three men suddenly emerged from behind a roadside electric pole and blocked Xiang's car. They</p>
<p>showed handguns and prohibited any noise. They immediately dragged Xiang Yixing into a chartered car parked on the road and ordered the driver to drive north quickly. At that time, Xiang's driver knew that his master had been kidnapped and was about to shout for help when he saw the bandits in the car throw out a note. The tone of the note stated that they were all unemployed hooligans who were not afraid of death, so there was no need to report to the police, otherwise they would tear up the ticket. There will be news in the concession within three days, at which time local celebrities can be invited to negotiate. Xiang's driver</p>
<p>picked up the note, feeling at a loss, and rushed back to Xiang's house to report and went to the Hongkou police station to request assistance. Unexpectedly, shortly after, the police station received a report from the Tailai Automobile Company on Oujia Road, claiming that three men had gone to the company yesterday morning and rented car number 2097. At that time, they ordered the car to drive to Xujiahui, and then turned to Juzhen Road. Once, they ordered the driver to give up his seat and had one man drive, going straight to Chongming Road in Hongkou. They got out of the car and instructed the driver to wait for them. Before long, they were seen pulling and pushing a man into the car,</p>
<p>looking like a kidnapping, and ordered the driver to drive quickly. However, when the car reached the intersection of Bailaohui Road and Oujia Road, they ordered the car to stop and fled one after another, hence the report. After taking the statement, the police learned that the two cases were related and immediately dispatched detectives to investigate for clues. They also paid special attention to the note left by the bandits. They also learned that Xiang Yixing had been kidnapped once in the spring of last year. Later, the case was solved by the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, and Xiang was safely rescued. The criminals involved in the case were sentenced to death by the court. Therefore, this is the second time he has been kidnapped.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit over Bad Check Leads to Breach of Trust and Embezzlement Charges</h3>
<p>Defendants are Wang Zhixin and Xu Changling, Zhao Jinghe Suffered Losses in Securities Trading</p>
<p>Wang Zhixin, the legal representative of Xinhua Bank on Jiangxi Road, and Xu Changling, the legal representative of Shui'an Securities Firm on Jiujiang Road, have recently been sued by Zhao Jinghe, a resident of Yongnian Li, 7 Baike Road in Suzhou, who engaged lawyer Yang Xun to file a complaint with the First Special Court's Criminal Division, alleging breach of trust and embezzlement. The facts of the lawsuit are briefly stated as follows: The plaintiff had dealings with Xinhua Bank and held a checkbook. A check for 400 yuan</p>
<p>to Yong'an Securities Firm</p>
<p>written on July 9 was unexpectedly dishonored, damaging both his reputation and credit, and resulting in suspension of trading and lost opportunities. Xu Changling, the manager of Yong'an Securities Firm, arbitrarily sold 10,000 yuan face value of July bonds on July 6 on behalf of the plaintiff without his consent. In the first session on the 9th, they sold it at 80.9 yuan, resulting in a loss of 250 yuan compared to the next session. Not only did they fail to recognize their mistake, but they also used the dishonored</p>
<p>400 yuan check</p>
<p>as blackmail and threatened criminal prosecution for issuing a bad check. They also withheld the account surplus of 544.28 yuan and the margin deposit trading book, ordering a halt to trading, resulting in missed opportunities. Their intentional harm to the plaintiff's reputation and financial interests is undeniable. Both defendants have violated Articles 137, 342, and 336 of the Criminal Law and should be prosecuted according to the law. A civil lawsuit is also attached, requesting</p>
<p>Wang Zhixin, the first defendant, to compensate</p>
<p>1,800 yuan for business losses and 3,000 yuan for damage to reputation, and to restore his reputation by publishing the entire judgment in all local newspapers for one week. The second defendant, Xu Changling, should be ordered to return the account profit of 544.28 yuan, the margin deposit trading book, and compensate for the damage of 250 yuan for the unauthorized sale. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin presided over</p>
<p>the Eighth Criminal Court and summoned the defendants. The defendants did not appear, but a lawyer appeared in court to state that the plaintiff had dealings with the Ximen branch of Xinhua Bank. However, on June 24 of this year, the plaintiff sent a letter requesting that his dealings be transferred to the head office, which was approved. Unexpectedly, the checks issued by the plaintiff later were still from the Ximen branch, leading to the mistaken dishonoring of the check. The court announced that the case would be rescheduled for trial on the morning of the 12th of this month.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Facts Speak Louder Than Eloquence</h3>
<p>— Luo Caiqing</p>
<p>Since the Luogouqiao Incident, the people of China have been clamoring for war. However, the traitors surrounding Song Zheyuan have been working hard for peace. Consequently, Mr. Song, who had previously made meritorious contributions in the Battle of Xifengkou, has been indecisive. It was not until the final ultimatum was rejected and the decision to resist was made that Pingjin fell in two days, and Tong and Zhao died in battle, causing national grief. Enemy planes were rampant and arrogant. The citizens breathing under the low air pressure could not help but feel bewildered. Two questions plagued them: Is the government determined to resist, and is China capable of fighting?</p>
<p>This attitude of doubting the government is our shame, but we can forgive and sympathize with it because it stems from a "keen desire to serve the country." Therefore, based on my limited knowledge, I would like to offer a simple explanation of these two questions to my patriotic compatriots:</p>
<p>On the day Song Zheyuan retreated to Baoding, Chairman Chiang issued his second statement, which included, "All the military failures in Pingjin are not related to Mr. Song. I am willing to bear the responsibility myself, and I am confident that I will be able to do my best to bear the full responsibility to save the critical situation in the future... Moreover, a temporary setback in military affairs should not be considered a failure, and the Battle of Pingjin cannot be considered to have been concluded. Since the Japanese army is deliberately invading China and is willing to use all kinds of means, it can be known that today's Battle of Pingjin is only the beginning of their war of aggression, and definitely not the end of their war. The people must be united in their determination to face the difficulties of China..."</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Gongzhan also stated in his speech at the council meeting of the Cultural Circles Salvation Association that we must know that this war of resistance is a decisive battle for the survival of the Chinese nation, and it is definitely not something that can be concluded in a short period of time or with one or two engagements. Now that the war of resistance has begun, it will definitely move forward day by day... Chairman Chiang has already indicated that he will absolutely not give in halfway. When you see today's statement by Chairman Chiang and Chairman Chiang's report at the Lushan Conference, you can see the firmness of Chairman Chiang's attitude, and we have absolutely no room for hesitation... But there are still people who doubt whether the central government is determined, and ask why a full-scale war of resistance is not being launched. It is of course not surprising that they ask this, because they simply do not understand war. War is a major matter of the state, and it is a specialized matter for military strategists. How can anyone who is not an expert in planning and strategy understand all the operational plans of war... When it comes to the final juncture, not fighting is also the demise of the country."</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Sun Ke also stated that "today's situation in North China is at the final juncture. The people of the whole country should trust the government and respond calmly, but we must make the people's spirit of resisting the enemy fully developed, strengthen the national strength, and achieve the final victory." Mr. Wang Jingwei should not seek details, explaining the significance of the final juncture. The determination to resist the enemy has already been clearly demonstrated, so how can we still doubt the government's attitude? This is the first question.</p>
<p>The second question is "Is China capable of fighting?" We are not military experts and cannot naturally predict in advance. The loss of Pingjin is indeed disheartening; however, this is not "the fault of the war." We must see the rising morale of the people in the rear and their willingness to sacrifice for the country; the uprising of the Volunteer Army in the Northeast to resist the enemy for the country; and the rebellion of the security team in Yinshi, which also achieved great feats. With this unified determination of the entire nation, how can we not fight?</p>
<p>Doubt is superfluous. Facts speak louder than eloquence. "Since the central government has made a decision, we cannot have doubts about military affairs, but only absolute faith in the leaders and the government. As long as the leaders and the government are leading us to resist the enemy," "no surrender, no compromise, no discouragement, no empty pride, the whole country is united, absolutely believing in Chairman Chiang as the commander-in-chief of the united resistance, and always obeying his orders, China will surely be able to revive."</p>

<h3>Appealing for the People in the War Zone, Increasing Our Strength to Save the Nation</h3>
<p>— Qiu Weilin</p>
<p>Moving, this kind of collective self-disturbing moving, is originally painful enough. Not only does it make people's hearts panic, but it also leads to a very bleak market, and it even puts society in a state of chaos. To put it seriously, this kind of moving exposes the weakness of the Chinese nation, letting the enemy know that it is a group of lambs without organization or training. However, the citizens of Zhabei, in the state of mind of talking about tigers changing color and birds frightened by bows, are still under the scorching sun, carrying suitcases and cages, dragging the big and carrying the small, busy with moving, with the general idea that only the concessions can provide a place to live: we cannot sympathize with this kind of event and think it is shameful.</p>
<p>However, let us calmly and quietly analyze the reasons for their moving, then we will not only sympathize with them, but also not be able to blame and scold them harshly.</p>
<p>The lessons of facts are too many, and the unforgettable Shanghai people are probably not difficult to remember the tragic scene of the "January 28th" Incident! The losses suffered by the residents of Zhabei are countless, and there are even those who committed suicide because they could not make a living after the war, and there are countless others who fell into beggary and prostitution. At that time, who came to think of a way for these unfortunate people? Then, in times of crisis, how can you call them to live quietly in the war zone, without any preparations for war, and do you want them to quietly wait for the incident to happen, to be baptized by airplanes and artillery, and to be smashed to pieces? Can this also be said to be pledging oneself to the country and sacrificing for the country?</p>
<p>Our Tianjin is currently being bombed by enemy planes, which is another very powerful proof. Everyone should be angry at the Japanese army's bestial behavior in the city. Thousands of residents were mowed down by machine guns, and there were even beheadings. Other cruel behaviors are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>This is a pointless sacrifice. Although in extraordinary times, death is originally not to be feared, but we want to die heroically like Zhao Dengyu and Tong Linge, resisting the war, and not be slaughtered like a group of lambs.</p>
<p>In short: The life-and-death war between China and Japan is unavoidable. The enemy's desire to create a serious situation in Shanghai is possible at any time. To prevent pointless sacrifices when the war develops, it is of course not possible by moving. We must make all kinds of preparations before the war. The most important thing is to make every citizen know the importance of defending the country, so we must use propaganda. On the one hand, we can make the citizens deeply understand the people's love and belief in the country, and at the same time, we can reduce the ugly performances of the Jiangbei Headquarters and the Maintenance Association after the outbreak of war. For propaganda work, we can start with the following points, such as wartime common sense, organizing air defense, bomb shelters, alarms, plainclothes guards, fire prevention, strictly preventing traitors from mixing in, military training and other work, and how to transport women and children to safety zones in wartime. How to cooperate with the army, how to build bombproof caves, and how to rescue the injured must all be deeply understood by the residents and trained in a short period of time. Anyway, to save the country, we do not necessarily have to go to the front line to serve. There is a lot of work in the rear that needs people to organize and lead. The people who lead and are responsible for doing salvation work should not ignore this point, and everyone should immediately rise up to do this work. If we want to reduce pointless sacrifices, then we must train the residents of Zhabei. We already know that the current is the war of resistance of the entire Chinese nation, then it is not enough to just live in a safe zone and issue declarations without using the strength of the masses to resist the war. I hope that those responsible for salvation will pay close attention to it and rise up to organize it.</p>
<h3>Song of War</h3>
<p>— Water Bubbles</p>
<p>There's no turning back,</p>
<p>The firelight paints the sky blood red.</p>
<p>The city is ablaze, black smoke licking the heavens, gunshots, cannon fire, sulfur bombs burning everywhere. Flames erupt from all sides, raging and spreading, the collapse of roof beams, the moans of the wounded, the cries of refugees, the terrified screams of children... Several stray dogs whimper and lick at the shattered tiles.</p>
<p>The strong wind whips up sand,</p>
<p>Crows caw mournfully and fly towards the horizon.</p>
<p>The hideous enemy,</p>
<p>Is carrying out a cruel massacre.</p>
<p>In the gutters, in the ruins, in the streets,</p>
<p>Everywhere are the corpses of innocent people, the enemy is carrying out a brutal slaughter. Machine guns are set up, spraying bullets at old women, the sick, children... rows of refugees fall down, they are treated worse than pigs, slaughtered as targets, they are innocent, they have already suffered, yet they are subjected to bayonets and bullets, ending their lives.</p>
<p>Arson, massacre, bombing...</p>
<p>The enemy will not cease its atrocities.</p>
<p>Night falls,</p>
<p>Flickering flames glimmer like stars.</p>
<p>In the muddy ditches flows the hot blood of our soldiers, in the wilderness are exposed the corpses of brave warriors, in life they heroically resisted the bloodthirsty demon, preventing the invasion of a group of mad beasts, using their bodies to build a new Great Wall, protecting the motherland, protecting the people... They died heroically and loyally, though they no longer shout, no longer snore, no longer make a sound, yet –</p>
<p>They are spirits – shimmering will-o'-the-wisps,</p>
<p>Pointing out the scorched path for us.</p>
<p>The drums of war sound,</p>
<p>We will no longer allow the enemy to slaughter us!</p>
<p>We will no longer allow the enemy to cut our throats, seize our lifeline, let bullets whistle past our ears, let shells explode around us, there is no more retreat, we have no way back – a heroic death is better than slow slaughter, rather than letting the enemy nibble away and erode us, it is better for us to bravely resist the enemy...</p>
<p>There's no turning back!</p>
<p>Charge! Kill! Let us advance!</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Shanghai West Caohéjing Homeless Work-Study Center</h3>
<p>— Jiang Yifan</p>
<p>In recent years, major cities in various charitable countries have established beggar asylums or pauper work-study centers, etc. Shanghai, as a port, has a larger gathering of vagrants and beggars than other ports, and the Shanghai Work-Study Center in Caohéjing, West Shanghai, is the most large-scale. Furthermore, since Mr. Hu Wenhu, a wealthy overseas Chinese merchant, recently donated and built single dormitories specifically for receiving the degenerate sons of wealthy families, it not only reveals a glimmer of hope for the future of these degenerate young people, but also serves as the only emergency savior for their unfortunate fathers and brothers, truly a charitable organization that is unique in the country. The reporter had long heard of its reputation, and on this trip to Shanghai, through a friend's introduction, was able to visit the center in person on July 19th. Transportation to the town is quite convenient. A public bus departs directly from the Old West Gate in the South City of Shanghai every hour, arriving in half an hour. Proceeding through the gate, one feels as if entering a large park, with beautiful scenery. Director Wu Zhinan personally greeted and guided the visit, the buildings were mostly Western-style, spacious and clean. Director Wu was amiable and sincere, providing detailed explanations at each location. First, we were led through the spinning mill, then the sock factory, the woodworking shop, and the printing shop. Director Wu mentioned that the most complete workshop was the weaving workshop, with expensive foreign machinery, the essence of the entire factory, but unfortunately, it was close to noon and work had ended, so he apologized for not being able to show it. The workers in the workshops all had shaved heads and wore blue uniforms, quiet, orderly, and very well-organized. Director Wu heard that the reporter had invented a new type of sanitary toilet in Changsha, Hunan, and inquired about the details, evidently in preparation for improving the center's toilets in the future. Director Wu's enthusiasm for sanitation equipment was evident from this. Finally, we were led to the single dormitories donated by Mr. Hu Wenhu, a row of Western-style rooms made of blue bricks. It was said that they already housed twenty-nine people, and their families had to voluntarily prepay three years of food expenses and a special donation totaling 316 yuan for them to be admitted. In order to preserve the faces of the residents, external guests were not allowed to visit inside. Although the residents each occupied a separate room next to each other, they were strictly isolated from each other and not allowed to meet, for fear of the spread of bad habits among them. Inside the room, in addition to eating and sleeping alone, they were also allowed to read books and were required to work, each winding cotton yarn in their room. (It has not been heard that they are taught other skills.)</p>
<p>After the reporter's visit, the overall impression was quite good, but there were still several points of doubt: those admitted were either homeless beggars or sons of wealthy families. Although their backgrounds were vastly different, they had one thing in common: they were all unemployed vagrants. The crafts taught should be chosen to suit the modern needs, allowing them to earn a living independently, simply and easily, without requiring huge capital. For example, repairing clocks and watches, repairing automobiles, tailoring Western-style suits, connecting electrical wires, connecting water pipes, installing wireless radios, etc. If the center were to establish a large-scale factory, requiring foreign machinery worth millions, then once these people leave the center, without the same large factory to employ them, they would still have no opportunity to earn a living. Wouldn't this inevitably lead to unemployment, violating the purpose of establishing the center? Director Wu said that parents who wish to send their wayward children to the center for training must prepay 316 yuan at once. If they escape or are bailed out of the center midway, the remaining amount will be confiscated. The center absolutely refuses to accept bank checks or postal money orders, and does not allow the three-year fees to be paid in installments. Even charitable philanthropists who are willing to donate, if they send a bank check, it will be returned and not accepted. Therefore, all families who wish to send their children to the center must carry a large wad of banknotes with them to pay. Wealthy people who wish to donate to charity must also risk carrying a large wad of banknotes with them to avoid being rejected. Unexpectedly, in Shanghai, a city of modern finance, there is still such an antiquated collection institution, which is truly astonishing. Mr. Wu also said that those who leave the center after completing the three-year term often have changed environments, and old habits resurface, or they degenerate even further. Some of their families have no choice but to send them back to the center, so the effectiveness is difficult to see, which is regrettable. Mr. Wu is sincere and honest, does not boast of achievements, and tells the truth, which is admirable. Moreover, at the entrance of the center, there is a notice stating: "Visitors are requested not to make laudatory remarks, and only welcome practical criticisms." The reporter only proposes the following improvements: ㊀ Those admitted into single rooms, although called wayward children in their families, are good materials for research in the eyes of those with specialized knowledge. Therefore, there should be considerable contact with professors from Shanghai universities (such as specialized scholars in sociology, eugenics, (genetics), psychology, and criminology), welcoming them to come to the center for research, and referring to their opinions, notifying the families of the residents, and spreading corresponding corrective measures. ㊁ Leaving the center upon completion of the term should not be based on the length of imprisonment as a standard, but should be changed to taking acquiring a skill that can support oneself as the minimum requirement; ㊂ With banks lining the concessions, a bank can be designated and entrusted to collect various payments, solving the problem of check payments. Those coming to the center only need to present the receipt issued by the bank as proof; (similar to the method of designated banks collecting tuition fees in schools everywhere recently) ㊃ The director of the center should introduce unfortunate parents to form a fundraising committee, so that all parents are concerned about their own interests and will be happy to participate.

<h3>Beware of the Iron Rings on the Doors</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhizhong</p>
<p>After Mr. Ji Yun's great work "The Iron Rings on the Doors are Stolen" was published the day before yesterday (the 31st), it aroused my curiosity. I had also witnessed the recent theft of door rings, but I didn't pay much attention to it. Now, Ji Yun's cry broke the silence, and I suddenly realized there was another reason. Isn't that so? The Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association will notify all citizens to properly store "scrap copper and iron" and not be tempted by small profits to sell them to the enemy. The hardware industry is also automatically investigating the private export of copper and iron. Who knew that some petty thieves, during this tense period of Sino-Japanese warfare, seeing the profit to be made from scrap copper and iron, would specialize in stealing the iron rings on the doors of Shikumen alleyways and sell them to secondhand shops set up by Chinese in North Sichuan Road, and these shops are being instigated by × people.</p>
<p>A few days ago, in the alley where I live, three families discovered that the iron rings on their doors had disappeared. Everyone assumed that petty thieves had stolen them to sell to secondhand stalls, and didn't pay much attention. Unexpectedly, the next morning, seven more families were found to have been robbed simultaneously. Only then did we realize that it was caused by the activities of these petty traitors at night.</p>
<p>Last month, my friend Mr. Chen warned me: "In Shipi Lane and Jinjia Lane in the South City, the copper and iron rings on the doors have been stolen frequently. The houses in the South City are mostly purely Chinese in style. For example, the copper rings on the courtyard gates are made of high-quality white copper and yellow copper! Large white copper rings cost up to six yuan each; yellow copper rings cost three or four yuan each." Therefore, petty traitors regard them as a source of profit, and we must strictly prevent them.</p>

<h3>Ant Society Establishes a Branch of the Anti-Enemy Support Association</h3>
<p>After participating in the establishment meeting of the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association, the Ant Society immediately established a branch within the society. The branch is currently carrying out daily fundraising activities, service investigations, lectures on Sino-Japanese issues, and current affairs forums. It also plans to hold training courses on first aid, air defense, and poison gas prevention in the shortest possible time to meet the urgent needs of the nation. People from outside are welcome to participate. Registration: Room 429, 4th Floor, Continental Emporium, Nanjing Road. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs announced the Shanghai</p>
<h3>Worker's Cost of Living Index for July</h3>
<p>The Shanghai worker's cost of living index for July of the 26th year was 109.51. Among the sixty items, nineteen were lower than the previous month, twenty-eight were higher, and thirteen remained the same. On average, it was 11.39% higher than the previous month. This is because, except for rent which remained unchanged, clothing and miscellaneous items fell slightly, while food and fuel were both higher.</p>
