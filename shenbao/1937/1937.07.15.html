<p>時評</p>
<h3>日增重兵進犯華北</h3>
<p>— 中</p>
<p>我國惟有以不屈不撓之精神沈着應付　希望日本朝野及早覺悟毋貽重大後悔</p>
<p>蘆溝橋事件發生以來。某將旬日。屨次調解。一味敷衍。侵犯軍隊。不肯撤退。今日調動各軍。圖謀大舉。日方旣無悔過之誠意。戰事自有擴大之可能。截止屬稿時。雖雙方人員。猶在折衡和平中。而和平之陽光。業已不絕如梗。此種破壞和平。引起大戰的責任。完全應由日方負之。毫無疑義。</p>
<p>現在我們用不着再拿理論。事實。條約。為根據而為之詳為解說。蓋被窮兵黷武的野心家。本將公理與人道。放在腦筋以外。以為武力卽理論。武力卽事實。條約條文。本是廢紙。故與之講理講法講道德。正是風馬牛不相及。然事實到底勝於雄辯。常舉世睽睽瞩目之中。固無所用其諱飾。亦無所用其强辯。茲姑舉美國各報一斑評論言之。則責任所在。自可明瞭。　　一•紐約報載。據此間熟悉遠東時局之觀察家。相信關東軍目前圖佔豐台蘆溝橋區域之行動。為欲控制華北交通。故目前日本之企圖。與瀋陽事變初無二致。</p>
<p>一•紐約民聲請讀報謂。日本軍人均屬狂妄之徒。若輩不受政府所持之和平政策所束縛。一旦有機可乘。則在華北擴充其竊權。</p>
<p>一•巴黎社會黨機關報人民報謂。日本旣欲解决地方事件。又以壓力加諸中國。而欲强令該國中央政府。接受政治需索。日本所圖者。首為東北四省。頃為冀察兩省。地點雖屬不同。但其所抱之慾望。與所採之方式。則始終如一。</p>
<p>以上種種對於日本此次侵略跋扈為之言論。並非我國被侵略者憤慨的言論。是站在第三者。看清內幕。代抱不平的言論。語日傍觀者清。當局者味。到此地步。方雖强自諱飾。强為掩護。亦屬徒然。我們卽可根據這種觀察與言論。則此次蘆溝橋事件之責任。固可不辯自明。再無所用其喋喋。</p>
<p>假定此次事件無法收束。日形擴大。我現在不先為我國打算。而先為日方打算。果為日本之利。抑為日本之禍。亦屬難言。蓋日本自九一八—二二六事件之後。軍人之跋扈擅權。已屬目空一世。無論何人組閣。若非接受軍部的條件。必至無法維持。並且駐華的關東軍。與駐冀察的駐屯軍。邀功生事。狂妄行為。卽政府恐亦無法制止其行動。在此種情形之下。而尚認為是一個有秩序的國家。我不敢信。此種局面。而能維持於永久。我更不敢信也。故此次戰事結果。日本僥倖而獲勝。則軍人之氣熖。更要囂張。更要跋扈。政府將從何收拾。假定結果而敗。則日本之原氣巳傷。一時不易恢復。更受各國輿論的指謪。亦恐無以自解。我深為日本危之。未議賢叨之日本朝野人士。亦曾念及此否。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>前綫與後方</h3>
<p>— 史楫</p>
<p>時局嚴重如今日，凡是稍有血氣者，是無不奮然而起的。這也不僅是限於前方將士的浴血苦戰，前方民衆的為勇士們裹傷；在後方當傳來了前方的將士們已忍無可忍奮起抗戰的消息，不是也不约而同地自動地彙集了不少的慰勞的捐款嗎？這一可歌可泣的自發的舉動，是說明了舉國一致的抗敵意識，是保證了“一盤散沙的評語已成為陳跡，也是說明了中國民衆近年來最可欣慰的進步之一：在同仇敵愾下，中國每個國民，除漢奸之外，已揚棄了小我的利益，而以民族的利益為重。而這可欣喜的現象，跟着救亡的砲火而高漲，在日益擴張中。</p>
<p>而且前綫和後方，在敵人的勢力深入於中國各部的目前，是很難劃分的，今日的後方，也許就是明日的前綫；所以，今日我們雖然在為華北前綫作慷慨輸將的義舉，而一方面，我們更不能不作明日就地殺敵的準備！慷慨輸將的義舉，我們不能一日或缺，而好男兒更得準備財產以外的更寶貴的東西獻於民族也。</p>
<p>因之，處於今日的後方的民衆，也不必一定把北上殺敵視為獻身民族的良機。我們殺敵的機會儘多着。而在後方還沒有成為前綫之前，我們更有許多抗敵的工作可幹！這决不是說是儘讓敵人來各個擊破，局部解决，反之，我們正因為要與前綫連繫起來，發揮更大的抗敵力量。處於今日的後方者，我們一方面該儘量的做援助前綫的工作，一方面還得為明日的前綫作準備，固守防地。我們不能讓一寸地遺失給敵人！</p>
<p>我們可做應做的工作正多着：捐錢給前綫將士祇是其一：在物質之外，我們還該有精神上的慰勞，例如組織慰勞團北上，又是其一：而在後方，為了建設精神上的國防，為了喚起落後民衆的一致奮起，我們更該有其他的救亡工作。</p>
<p>例如發起救亡歌唱，推動救亡戲劇的公演等等。</p>
<p>關於歌詠救亡運勸，民教館的歌詠隊已經在發動了，詳細情形我們還不知道，祇知道是歡迎各種歌詠團體及愛好音樂者的參加。關於這，我想，我們是應該十二萬分的加以幫助，促其實現的，並且這實現還必需是在最短期間；另外，則也不必限於這一個，祇有是在同一的救亡目標下，越多越妙，而且規模大小，也可以隨時隨地而異，在設有精巧偉大的機關槍大砲之前，就是一把純銹的匕首，也應該有其殺敵的功用！其形式，也不必一定要有什麼會的儀式，祇要能推進就行，舉凡電台，街頭，農村，工塲，都是最好的去處，而且不僅是限於自己會唱，應該立刻教會別人，而歌的詞句和含義，則更應該解釋明白。</p>
<p>至於救亡戲劇的公演，因為有道具服裝等等的限制，那自然是比較困難一些，但也應該可能的去做，一方面，我們的劇作者更該多編寫一些新而容易上演的劇本出來！</p>
<p>救亡的目標是祇有一個的，其方式，則應該多多益善，並且也不要限於前綫和後方。</p>
<p>自然，這需要有一個先决條件，那就是政府應該立刻恢復民衆運動，舉凡是救亡，就該無條件的允許並幫助其實現！</p>
<h3>蘆溝橋可為我人之墳墓</h3>
<p>— 克予</p>
<p>我的朋友，有血性的中國朋友，前天，當你翻開報紙看到“日軍砲轟宛平”幾個觸目大字時，你是何等的憤慨與驚惶！之後，你以為雙方已進行和平解决，事態當不致擴大，但是，在日本有意尋事企圖再製第二“九一八”的處心下，這暫時的緩兵，早被關心國事的朋友所意料的，一．待他們把增援的關東軍調遣定當後，他們又進攻了！</p>
<p>於是，“華北情形萬分嚴重”八個驚人心目的大字，在昨天的申報上你看到了。此時我想：你的血壓一定高漲着，你肯讓他們這麼蠻幹下去嗎？有血性的朋友，我知道你將高呼：“不能再忍了！我們守衛抗戰的時機到了！”</p>
<p>我的朋友，你立刻會記起，宛平事變初生時二十九軍的一句壯語：“蘆溝橋可為我人之墳墓！”二十九軍，這抗衛過長城各口的二十九軍，為了爭求民族的解放，為了人類的和平與正義，忠勇的他們，一定能再繼續先前浴血的精神，拼命地去抵抗的！我們也相信：政府已準備萬一，為了我們的老百姓。</p>
<p>不過，準備是準備，準備了是否出動去抗爭，這你我都不敢說，然而我們，總都不愿與滿洲遭受同樣的悲慘吧！</p>
<p>東北同胞“打回老家去！”的歌聲，想你聽得夠了，年來友邦奴化與毒化東北同跑的慘聞，想你也聽得夠了，這些，你感到怎樣？你痛心嗎？你憤慨嗎？你想復仇嗎？</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>“起來，不愿做奴隸的人們，用我們的熱血，保衛我們生命的蘆溝橋！”每一個有血氣的中國朋友，都應該、這麼喊，而且大聲地喊。</p>
<p>蘆溝橋是華北國防的重地，西南高矗着長辛店工廠的烟囱，南面就是交合着許多條鐵路的大车站豐台，這一带附近的田裏，种着丰富的榖子•玉米•高梁•落花生和棉花，駱駝馱着整袋的煤塊和成筐的紅柿子，終日繫着铜鈴，一步一摆地走着，橋下是流着永定河，這河在古代中華民族的對外戰爭上，曾發生過多次的存亡關係，但不知現在的戰士，能否負起捍衛我們河山的責任！</p>
<p>為了捍衛我們的國土，為了維護我們的主權，蘆溝橋可為我人之墳墓！</p>
<h3>野鳥練飛學校</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>英國的法律，禁止人民捕賣野鳥，但在養鳥室孵養的，跟鳥腿上有環的，却不在此例。那環是在小鳥孵出才幾天，還沒有離窠的時候，套在牠的腿上。因此有些賣鳥的人，捕着野鳥，也把環子套在牠的脚上，以規避法律。但被禁止虐待牲畜會查見了後，便須依法處罪，那鳥却由官府沒收釋放。</p>
<p>長閉在小籠裏的野鳥，因為兩翅久不活動，會失去它飛的本能，一旦釋出，仍不免落於弋者之手，而不能享自由之樂。因此一般愛鳥的善士，便替牠們打算，設立了一個練飛學校，以便牠們出籠之後，練習高飛，等到牠們能一舉冲天，便任牠們重入林野。英國第一所野鳥練飛學校，是在泰姆士狄頓鎮愛赫白鄉由禁止虐待牲畜會創辦，取名動物休養所，六月十五日正式開幕的那天，由該會總董高和爾爵士的小姐女飛行家駕了飛機，在該校四周天空飛行了片刻，然後降地，宜布開幕。會員到會參觀第一批“練習生”的，共有數百人。</p>
<p>校內空地，設了一所高十二呎寬敵的鳥房，其中住着善鳴的野鳥十二隻，那是幾隻花鷄，兩隻金翅雀，金翅雀是英國最美麗的野鳥，一隻紅冠雀，一隻斷尾的灰雀，其中幾雙小鳥，由卖鸟人在脚上套了小環，冒充家孵的鳥出售，被禁止虐待牲畜會证明那是野鳥，報告警署，把牠們沒收了。</p>
<p>這練飞學校已關辦了一两個月，几隻鳥在校內練習之後，已恢複健康跟氣力，而得到自由了。離校屋數碼有一片草地，跟一排樹林，那是出籠小鳥極美的休養所。還有一間巨室，地面用三合土築成，以免藏匿老鼠，室內放着花草盆景，中間有一株矮樹，還有一架斜梯，供牠們跳躍之用，至於食料，浴盆，水缽，鳥窠，無不應有盡有，凡兩翅受損的小鳥，在裏面練習短飛，極為安樂。牠們很有靈性，等到力能高飛遠舉的時候，自會不再破費主人，去自求生路。有一隻夜鶯，住在鳥房多時，已很馴熟，會飛息在任何人的手指上。牠是去年冬季在庚辛屯園雪中被人覔見，幾將凍死，一腿受傷甚重，一眼已瞎。牠在校裏休養了六星期，已會稍稍地飛起，現希望牠有一天能恢復自由，否則牠便要在校裏盡其餘生了。所以這個學校，不但供給野鳥練習飛行，還是一個殘廢的野鳥養老院哩。</p>
<p>在頂層一間大室中，有一隻烏鴉，那是曾飛進某家，主人見牠力弱而很可憐，把牠送到學校裏休養。牠現在依然很弱，還不能善用牠的兩翅。前幾天該校還收容了一隻貓頭鷹，眼睛受傷甚重，那全日照料羣鳥的吉爾白先生時常用藥水很耐性地替牠洗眼睛，白天使牠伏在一隻籃中，夜裏放她在一間大室裏，任牠自由。還有一隻小黑鳥，嘴上受傷，由吉爾白先生用手喂食。有幾隻鴿子在校裏休養了多時，現在已能照管自己，自由飛行，牠們時常飛出校外逍遙。</p>
<p>校中除掉一間供善鳴的野鳥棲息所外，還有兩間大鳥房，其中住着一隻鸚鵡，幾隻金絲雀，還有若干隻外國鳥，那外國鳥放牠們自由，徒然送死，所以將永遠留在校中了。那鸚鵡是因為前主人由一所有花園的往宅遷移到高廈的樓上，不愿便牠失去在花園裏的自由，所以送到校裏，使牠可以安樂。那外國鳥有的也是主人送來，以便牠們享受可能的自由，有幾隻是被人棄在一間空屋中，幾將餓死，經警察覔見，送到校裏，使牠們得到生路。</p>
<p>練飛學校最初是由奇斯維克鎮白蘭狄煦女士發起，因為她曾見一位愛鳥者在瑞士新教堂鎮附近造了一所鳥房，救濟剛由籠裏釋出的禽鳥，女士發起未久，泰姆士狄頓鎮愛赫白鄉的禁止虐待牲畜會便實行創辦這練飛學校，預料將來必能推行於全國，這真是野鳥的福音。咳！野鳥的自由，有人這麼注意，而那受壓迫的弱小民族失去他們的自由，却熟視無覩，無人援手，這可算得“目能見秋豪而不見輿薪。”了。</p>
<p>編者按：現在我們不再希望“公理”來“援手”，這世界上已經沒有“公理”了！我們要振起我們的翅翼，在天空中自由地飛翔！聽着，華北的砲聲響了，這就是我們自由飛翔的時候！</p>

<h3>鞭</h3>

<p>慘淡底陽光，照着遼闊的原野。原野是一個大的搖籃，又是一個古老的墳墓，原野上總是籠罩着憂鬱。</p>
<p>秋風，啞然吹過枯槁的平原，像是哀訴，又像是呻吟。</p>
<p>牛，是仁慈的動物。在荒寂的田野上，每年總是用盡了力量，拖着山般重的鐵犂，給人們耕下了無限的幸福。</p>
<p>我門應當感謝這仁慈的動物吧！</p>
<p>殘酷的人們，是有着蛇蝎底心腸的。當仁慈的動物犂過了過多的田野而停立住作它片刻休息的時候，蔓長的皮鞭於是從肩上拉下來了。</p>
<p>仁慈的動物忍不下這殘厲底痛苦，發出了一聲如野狼底嗥叫，於是又拖着萬斤重的東西前進了。</p>
<p>等到用盡了氣力，而再作一次舒息的時候，一陣皮鞭又落到了它的身上。</p>
<p>牛，仁慈的忠誠的動物呵！為了人們的幸福，你所以才挨這難忍的鞭策麼？</p>

<p>命運，祇是如一個輕薄的幻影。寂寞，飄渺。</p>
<p>長途的跋涉，使我感到了迢迢旅途的疲倦。我又沈默地憇息在山野的古剎裏了。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Steadily Arrive in Tianjin; Tightened Security Since Last Night</h3>
<p>Negotiations between Chinese and Japanese Personnel Underway in Tianjin; Japanese Cavalry Attack 29th Army Headquarters but are Repelled; Reports of Conflict Between Yangcun and Luofa Unconfirmed</p>
<p>[Tianjin] More than 200 Japanese troops stationed in Korea arrived in Tianjin on a special train at 11:00 PM on the 14th. Officials have recently denied the occurrence of conflict in Yangcun. Tianjin has tightened security since 10:00 PM on the 14th, and police stations have reduced lighting. (Urgent dispatch, 3:00 AM on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] According to news from the road, there were sounds of gunfire and artillery in Yangcun at 9:00 PM on the 14th. It is rumored that Japanese troops who departed from Tianjin this morning clashed with the 38th Division. The situation is unclear. (Urgent dispatch, 1:00 AM on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Approximately 600-700 Japanese troops, in a train from Tianjin, heading to Fengtai, passed Yangcun at 9:00 PM on the 14th. Upon reaching Luofa, they apparently clashed with our troops stationed there, and fighting is ongoing. As a result, all overnight trains between Beiping and Jinan have been suspended. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] At 5:00 PM on the 14th, over 200 Japanese cavalrymen, passing through the south of Nanyuan via Tuanhe, south of Fengtai, attacked the headquarters of the 29th Army in Nanyuan. Our troops immediately met them with a fierce counterattack, and the Japanese cavalry retreated. Both sides suffered casualties. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] It is rumored that Japanese troops have surrounded our garrison between Yangcun and Luofa on the Beining Railway, leading to a clash. Enquiries to local officials here have been unable to confirm this. Furthermore, around 10:00 PM on the 14th, another train carrying over 200 Japanese soldiers arrived at Tianjin East Station. (Central News Agency dispatch, morning of the 15th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] As of 10:00 PM on the 14th, Japanese troops from the Yongdingmen, Dajingcun, and Guangqumen areas retreated towards Shuangtong. Only a small number of infantry and artillery remain at the Pinghan Railway culvert east of Wanping County. Lugou Bridge is still in the hands of our troops. From the afternoon of the 14th, both sides' outposts retreated several hundred meters each. Martial law was implemented in Beiping at 11:00 PM on the 14th, and the situation is peaceful. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] An atmosphere of easing tensions is strong. Both sides will have talks in Tianjin this afternoon. In addition to reporting, Zhang Zizhong and Qi Xieyuan will go to Tianjin to meet Song (Zheyuan) and participate in the talks. However, the Japanese military deployment has not been withdrawn, and large numbers of troops continue to arrive. One group remains concerned about the situation after the talks. This afternoon, the reporter went to Wanping. The city gates are still closed, preventing entry. Lugou Bridge is still guarded by our troops, with Japanese troops positioned a kilometer away, firing randomly. The reporter stood on the bridge for ten minutes, during which approximately dozens of bullets fired by Japanese troops flew overhead. A portion of Japanese troops outside Guang'anmen has not yet withdrawn. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] After 10:00 AM on the 14th, an important conference on countermeasures for the current situation was held at the Jinde Society on 19th Road in the British Concession of Tianjin. Song Zheyuan was the central figure, and Zhang Zizhong, Qi Xieyuan, Chen Juesheng, Deng Zhexi, Liu Jialuan, Li Wentian, and others participated. As of the time of dispatch, the meeting was still ongoing. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Hezhi flew back to Tianjin from Beiping at 7:00 AM on the 14th. The Japanese officials responsible for diplomacy are still Hashimoto, Hezhi, Tsukada, Matsui, and others. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The overall situation is indeed turning, and the focus of negotiations has shifted to Tianjin. An outline of the agreement was already discussed on the night of the 13th, awaiting specific provisions. After Qi (Xieyuan) arrives, there will be consultations at Song (Zheyuan)'s residence in Tianjin. The suburbs of Beiping are currently peaceful. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Zhang Zizhong arrived in Tianjin by special train from Beiping at 2:30 PM on the 14th. He immediately met with Liu Jialuan, the Security Commander, and Li Wentian, the Tianjin Police Chief, to discuss security issues. At 6:00 PM, he went to Song's residence on 17th Road in the British Concession to report to Song. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The situation on the morning of the 14th tended to ease. Those responsible for negotiations between China and Japan were working for peace throughout the night on the 13th, with contacts in both Beiping and Tianjin. It was mistakenly reported yesterday that Zhang Zizhong had returned to Tianjin. It is now known that he will arrive in Tianjin from Beiping by special train this afternoon to meet with Song and discuss everything. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Judging from the negotiation situation here this afternoon, the atmosphere of peace is becoming stronger. Those responsible for the talks say that the immediate task is to have both sides' troops withdraw separately and keep a distance to avoid excessive opportunities for friction. Efforts are currently being made, and the other side has agreed. The handling of the aftermath will have to wait until the clash is completely stopped. According to those responsible, it seems inevitable that the other side's troops entering Shanhaiguan will be used as a diplomatic "cannon" for a short period of time. In short, future conflicts may not occur again. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] As of 8:00 PM on the 14th, the four suburbs of Beiping were calm, and the Japanese army had no activity. More than 600 Japanese troops arrived in Fengtai by car, but did not advance. A portion of Japanese troops was still camping on the east side of Dahongmen, and Japanese troops were building fortifications outside Guang'anmen. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Chinese and Japanese representatives here continued negotiations on the 14th. Chen Juesheng and Deng Zhexi were in constant contact with Hashimoto, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Garrison, and staff officers Hezhi and Tsukada. Relevant parties believe that there is still a glimmer of hope for peace regarding the Lugou Bridge Incident, but they cannot make a definitive statement about when the Japanese will withdraw their troops. In short, the situation at the front today has gradually eased, but a resolution to the overall situation seems to depend on continued negotiations between the two sides. Chen Juesheng met with Song at 4:00 PM on the 14th to report on the negotiations with the Japanese and seek instructions. He will meet with Tsukada and other staff officers of the Japanese Garrison again tonight. After Zhang Zizhong arrived in Tianjin on the afternoon of the 14th, Deng Zhexi visited him to exchange opinions. Zhang Yunrong also came to Tianjin on the 14th. In the evening, Zhang and others met with Song to report on the situation in Beiping and seek instructions on everything. It is reported that our side is still willing to make the greatest effort for peace, but the outcome depends on whether the Japanese side wants to escalate the situation. It was widely rumored here on the 14th that there was still fighting in the suburbs of Beiping, but according to Zhang Zizhong, who returned to Tianjin, the city of Beiping gradually calmed down on the 14th, and nothing happened in Nanyuan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The situation here this morning is slightly more relaxed, as most of the Japanese troops have withdrawn from the Wanping area to Fengtai. Three trains have now left Beiping heading south. The first train is a special train carrying American military officers returning to Qinhuangdao. Both China and Japan now say that negotiations are underway in Tianjin, presided over by Zhu Zheyuan and the Japanese military authorities, in the hope of establishing a new agreement. Yongdingmen is extremely crowded, as thousands of people from the recent combat areas have poured into the city. In addition, there are also vehicles loaded with food and vegetables wanting to enter the city. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Shortly after midnight, Chinese and Japanese troops clashed again, causing the terrified residents of Beiping to be unable to sleep peacefully again all night. Just as residents were about to go to bed, the sounds of mortars, cannons, and gunshots rang out in succession, as dense as a string of pearls. Apparently, fighting had broken out again near the city gates. Since the conflict occurred last Thursday, this fierce battle has been the closest to Beiping. Fortunately, the gunfire and artillery fire stopped after half an hour. At the same time, talk of a peace agreement still filled the air. After Beiping Mayor Qin Dechun met with Kato, the First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy, a senior Chinese official claimed that there was still a glimmer of hope for an honorable peace, and said that the Hebei-Chahar authorities would never sacrifice Chinese sovereignty. Yesterday's fighting outside Yongdingmen was caused by two Japanese heavy-duty vehicles mistakenly taking a wrong route, leading to a conflict. The British and other embassies have instructed foreigners living in the suburbs to take refuge in the city. Yesterday afternoon, two large contingents of Japanese troops, totaling 1,100 men, arrived in Fengtai from Gubeikou along the land route, carrying several tanks and armored vehicles. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] From 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 14th, ten Japanese soldiers in a heavy vehicle and a tank attempted to drive towards Yongdingmen from Yaogangzi, west of Yongdingmen. They were stopped by our troops. The Japanese opened fire, and we returned fire. The Japanese then retreated. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>[Beiping] According to reliable information, Japanese troops have also arrived in Miyun County, northeast of Beiping. This has caused great anxiety among the residents of Beiping.

<h3>Large Numbers of Japanese Troops Headed to Fengtai</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] At 3:00 AM this morning, approximately 3,000 Japanese infantrymen, carrying mortars and machine guns, departed by land for Fengtai. Four trains carrying soldiers, automobiles, anti-aircraft guns, and cement arrived at Tianjin East Station last night and this morning. Between 4:30 AM and 9:00 AM this morning, four Japanese planes flew over Tianjin four times. The Japanese authorities issued a statement regarding the clashes near Beiping, saying that the Chinese side had repeatedly engaged in "provocative" riots. It is difficult to predict how the situation will develop, but if the situation becomes more serious, the Chinese army will be responsible. (Central News Agency, Reuter's dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Near Fengtai, the Japanese troops moving in from Tongxian from beyond Shanhaiguan are already over a brigade, including two infantry regiments, approximately 4,000 men, over 100 machine guns, eight heavy cannons, and eight heavy tanks. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Baoding] Japanese troops have completely occupied civilian houses in villages near Fengtai and are hastily constructing fortifications, showing no sign of withdrawing their troops. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Inspection of the Dahongmen Area</h3>
<p>[Beiping] At 3:00 PM on the 14th, this reporter left Guang'anmen to inspect the situation of the Japanese troops in Dajingcun. Guang'anmen is closed intermittently, opening every two hours to allow people to enter and exit. From Guang'anmen to Xiaojingcun is about eleven li. Along the way, the reporter personally witnessed the Japanese army near Xiaojingcun. Upon reaching Dajingcun, the site of repeated clashes between Chinese and Japanese troops, there was a small teahouse by the roadside. Approximately 20 Japanese soldiers there stopped the reporter with guns, not allowing passage. After negotiations, there was no result. The reporter informed them that both China and Japan had hopes for peace, so I came to inspect the troop withdrawal situation. One of the Japanese soldiers replied that there was no such thing and told me to leave quickly. The Japanese soldiers in the area were all bare-armed and were digging trenches at the village entrance. Judging by their formation, it seemed to be defending against an attack from our troops stationed in the city. There were seventeen elm branches bound together to make a gun rack in front of the teahouse, and another machine gun was set up on the ground. A Japanese soldier was on the roof of the teahouse, looking around with binoculars. The reporter looked around and found many Japanese soldiers hidden in the nearby sorghum fields. Judging by their posture, there was absolutely no preparation to withdraw immediately. After the reporter entered the city, he went to Yongdingmen to inspect. The situation of the clash between Chinese and Japanese troops at noon on the 13th was as follows: outside Shuidingmen, on the road south of the Beining Railway Bridge, there was a bombed Japanese heavy vehicle and a small passenger car, leaving only the vehicle frame. Next to the vehicle was a Japanese steel helmet and a pile of unidentifiable garbage, swarming with flies, possibly human remains. The heavy vehicle was the bombed ammunition vehicle. The reason for the bombing is said by some to be that our troops hit it and it exploded, while others say that it caught fire due to a cylinder explosion. The cause has not yet been determined. The small car carried a Japanese commander, who was traveling with the heavy vehicle, so he was also affected. It is rumored that the commander has died, while others say that he escaped after the explosion. The stories vary, making it difficult to determine the truth. Continuing south from the Beining Railway to Dahongmen, there was another Japanese vehicle that crashed into a large tree by the roadside and could not move, probably due to panic while driving. There are now several boxes of ammunition on the vehicle, guarded by our police. It is estimated that as a result of the conflict outside Yongdingmen at noon on the 13th, the Japanese suffered five deaths, two injuries, and twelve missing. On the 14th, the Japanese side, together with our personnel, searched everywhere, but had not found them as of 6:00 PM. After the Japanese army was repelled by our army at noon on the 13th, there was another clash at about 2:00 AM on the morning of the 14th, after which they withdrew. Currently, there are no Japanese troops in the Yongdingmen to Nanyuan area, but our army is on high alert in the Dahongmen area. The residents near Yongdingmen have been greatly frightened by the repeated clashes. After investigation, there is not much damage. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] According to refugees fleeing from the battlefield outside the city to Yongdingmen, the sound of gunfire was incessant at night and did not stop until 3:30 this morning. The Chinese side claimed that a detachment of Japanese soldiers traveling by heavy vehicles from Gubeikou to Fengtai opened fire on Chinese troops between Beiping and Nanyuan. The battle was the same as the battle of the previous day. At that time, 500 Japanese soldiers, carrying four tanks and several armored vehicles, had general contact with the Chinese forces on the road between Beiping and Fengtai, and then gradually approached until the battle extended to the road bridge outside Yongdingmen. Today, an inspection outside Yongdingmen revealed traces of the battle. Two Japanese heavy vehicles and a car carrying officers were destroyed and abandoned on the side of the road. One of the show types of vehicles, the car body was badly damaged. The Japanese army seemed to have come directly from Gubeikou to Tongzhou, and reached the road bridge outside Yongdingmen, where there was only a small path to Fengtai, so they abandoned the car and fled. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Parading in Tianjin Disturb Merchants and Residents</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] Over a thousand Japanese soldiers departed from the Haiguang Temple barracks at approximately 9:00 PM on the 14th, passing through Dongmalu and over the Jinguang Bridge, continuing along the Pingjin Highway. It is unknown whether they were heading to Fengtai or Yangcun. When the Japanese soldiers departed, they were stationed on guard on Asahi Street in the Concession, prohibiting vehicles, horses, and pedestrians. When passing through Dongmalu, the leading Japanese cavalrymen drove away pedestrians. The general public fled in a scramble, and the shops closed one after another. The night markets in Hedong and Hezhao South City also immediately closed, causing disorder. After 9:30 PM, all of the Japanese soldiers had reached the Pingjin Highway, and order gradually returned to the city. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] At 8:30 PM on the 14th, over 1,500 Japanese infantry and artillery troops from Haiguang Temple traveled along Dongmalu and Huangweilu, departing towards Fengtai along the Pingjin Highway. Traffic was blocked when passing through the Chinese district. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Over 2,000 Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery troops coming to Tianjin departed at 4:00 PM on the 14th to reinforce Beiping. The men and horses lined up in a tunnel and departed from the Haiguang Temple barracks, passing through Dongmalu, Hebei Huangweilu, and other places, shouting slogans along the way. Planes from the Tianjin Limingzhuang Airport flew to Beiping at 4:00 PM on the 14th, carrying large amounts of artillery shells to assist in the battle. (Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] At 7:00 PM on the 14th, over a hundred fully armed Japanese soldiers paraded from Haiguang Temple, resting in the Mapeng Hutong at the southeast corner of the city, setting up guns and driving away pedestrians, causing the ignorant masses to run away. The order in Special District 2 of Dongmalu was greatly disrupted, traffic was cut off, and the Nanjia Shangmen streetcar stopped. Order was gradually restored after a moment. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] At 9:00 PM tonight, suddenly 600 Japanese infantrymen, 100 cavalrymen, and a motor vehicle convoy departed from the Japanese Concession towards Dongmalu in the Chinese district. Pedestrians fled in terror, unable to avoid them. The Chinese side had not received any notification in advance, and all traffic was temporarily cut off. The shops closed en masse. At 3:00 AM this morning, 1,000 Japanese soldiers also carried out the same maneuver, but there were very few pedestrians at that time, so the security team limited them to wait for orders from their superiors. Afterwards, the Japanese army organized to continue its departure to Beiping. It is said that the Chinese side intends to close the bridge at the beginning of the highway to prevent the Japanese army from passing through again. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Wounded Japanese Soldiers Transported Back to Tianjin</h3>

<h3>Situation of Martial Law in the Streets of Beiping</h3>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Declaration in America</h3>
<p>China Has Tremendous Resolve to Defend Its Territory</p>
<p>[New York] Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi issued the following statement today regarding the tense situation in North China: "An unfortunate and serious incident has occurred in North China, and the future is very dangerous. China has always maintained a policy of extreme patience towards Japan for many years, sincerely hoping to maintain friendship and peace with neighboring countries. In recent months, China has strongly believed that enlightened leaders within the Japanese government have been able to shift the opinions of their military personnel and that some radical elements could perhaps restrain themselves somewhat. Unfortunately, these radical elements are still disrupting the peace between China and Japan with an incident they themselves created. I call it self-created because, with respect to the location of Lugouqiao, Japan has no right, either legally or morally, to conduct military exercises there. I sincerely hope that the world will not lightly believe the lengthy explanations and sophistical propaganda made by Japan. Although China now hopes to maintain friendly relations with Japan, if the Japanese military continues to invade and declare Chinese territory as theirs, then China will no longer be able to remain silent. I believe that the abnormal situation created by the Japanese army in North China is not only troubling but has also endangered world peace. People with foresight should know that my words are not wrong. A single spark can start a prairie fire, and if the war is not stopped, it will spread rapidly. We still hope that Japan will have an enlightened leader who can care for the welfare of the people and dare to uphold justice and reject the use of force. If sovereignty is not harmed, then China seeks peace; however, if it is necessary to defend ourselves to preserve the integrity of our territory and national independence, then we have no choice but to resolve to defend ourselves," and so on.

<h3>Europe and America Pay Attention to the Far East Situation; Close Consultation Between Britain and America</h3>
<p>The Time for Joint Action is Not Yet Ripe; Hoping for an Early End to the Sino-Japanese Dispute; Our Ambassadors Visit Authorities in Various Countries</p>
<p>[London] People in London are now paying attention to the Far East situation. Foreign Secretary Eden is in close contact with the U.S. government at all times. Eden also met with Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi today and said that the British government urgently hopes for an early resolution to the Sino-Japanese conflict because once the situation expands, it will greatly harm British interests in China. The British Foreign Secretary also expressed the same views to Japanese Ambassador Yoshida Shigeru and the U.S. Chargé d'affaires yesterday. People here generally hope that China and Japan will resolve their disputes early. What they are worried about is that if both sides blame each other for the responsibility of starting the war, it may create obstacles to a solution for the sake of dignity. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi today. According to reliable sources, Britain firmly believes that the Far East crisis can be resolved peacefully. The British Consulate is constantly notifying the United States. (National Telegraph, 13th) Washington, D.C. Secretary of State Hull declared today that he had received a note from the British government last night. The content has not been announced, but he stated that he does not believe a formal reply is necessary for this note. The United States will continue to take a unilateral action policy and wait for the development of the Far East situation. Although there is no lack of shared interests between Britain and the United States, and they should consult with each other, there is no need to take joint action. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Although the U.S. State Department has not expressed anything regarding the current dispute between China and Japan, semi-official sources believe that the U.S. government is now trying to localize it. Once this effort fails, it plans to adopt the following procedures: ① Concerned countries advise the Chinese and Japanese governments to take appropriate measures. ② The Washington Nine-Power Treaty signatories consult with each other to determine how to respond. ③ China submits a complaint to the League of Nations. ④ If the incident in northern China develops into a war between China and Japan, the United States may have to implement the Neutrality Act. Fortunately, neither China nor Japan wants the situation to escalate, which is helpful to the mediation work of the U.S. government. In short, the U.S. government must wait for the current situation to develop before choosing one of the above methods to maintain the peaceful situation. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>[Washington] According to well-informed sources, the British government suggested in the note that concerned countries should immediately consult with each other to take joint action on the recent North China Incident. However, the U.S. government does not seem prepared to follow this proposal. According to official sources, it is necessary to wait for the situation to progress before determining the U.S. attitude. General observers believe that the U.S. intention seems to be to wait and see, but this does not mean that the United States does not intend to take any action in the future. The United States would rather wait for the situation to be fully clear in order to take more effective action. If the United States implements the Neutrality Act, it will be a detached action and consistent with Hull's words. However, related parties believe that the Neutrality Act will not be implemented in the shortest period of time. According to the provisions of the Neutrality Act, the United States should prohibit loans to belligerent countries, and U.S. ships should not transport any goods that the President of the United States decides can be used for military purposes to belligerent countries. If so, U.S. exports to Japan will inevitably be greatly damaged. Semi-official sources now believe that the U.S. government's attitude may not be announced in the next few days. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun told the Associated Press today that he had explained to French Foreign Minister Delbos the various facts that caused the Far East crisis. Ambassador Gu also said that Japan wants to turn North China into Manchuria II, which is undoubtedly true. The Chinese military knows that Japan will transfer troops from Korea and Kwantung to attack on July 15, hoping to occupy the entire Huabei area. However, the Chinese army will resist to the last man. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Wang Zhengting recently visited Secretary of State Hull and talked for twenty minutes. Afterwards, Wang Zhengting told reporters that although the current situation is tense, China should still do its best to maintain peace. If all else fails, China will have no choice but to take self-defense actions to resist Japanese aggression. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun declared today that Japan launched the incident during the period of unrest in Lassa. The world should still know that the true purpose of the Japan-Germany agreement has not yet been fully revealed. The Chinese military is aware that Japan will transfer troops from its domestic Korea and Kwantung on July 15 to launch an attack, hoping to occupy the entire Huabei area. However, the Chinese army will resist to the last soldier. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] German Foreign Minister Neurath received Chinese Ambassador Cheng Tianfang and Japanese Ambassador Mushakōji one after another today regarding the current situation in North China. Diplomatic circles now believe that the two ambassadors are inquiring about the German government's attitude and stating their respective governments' positions. At the same time, German newspapers are now maintaining a neutral attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute. Some Japanese observers find the attitude taken by the German newspapers to be strange because Germany and Japan signed a mutual assistance agreement in January of last year.

<h3>Japan Increases Heavy Troops to Invade North China</h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>Our Country Can Only Respond Calmly with an Indomitable Spirit; Hoping that the Japanese Government and Public will Realize the Truth Early and Not Cause Major Regret</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, it has been nearly ten days. Repeated mediation has been nothing but perfunctory. Invading troops are unwilling to withdraw. Today, troops are being mobilized to plot a major attack. Since the Japanese side has no sincerity in repenting, there is a possibility of the war expanding. As of the time of writing, although personnel from both sides are still negotiating for peace, the light of peace has become as fragile as a thread. The responsibility for destroying peace and causing a major war should be borne entirely by the Japanese side, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Now, we don't need to use theories, facts, and treaties as the basis for detailed explanations. After all, those obsessed with militarism and warmongering have put justice and humanity out of their minds. They believe that force is theory, force is fact, and treaty clauses are nothing more than waste paper. Therefore, it is like talking to a cow about music to reason, legislate, or moralize with them. However, facts ultimately speak louder than words. Under the constant worldwide attention, there is no need for concealment or strong arguments. Now, let's take a look at some comments from American newspapers to understand where the responsibility lies.</p>
<p>• The New York Post reported that observers familiar with the Far East situation believe that the current action of the Kwantung Army to occupy the Fengtai and Lugouqiao areas is to control North China's transportation. Therefore, Japan's current attempt is no different from the beginning of the Mukden Incident.</p>
<p>• The New York Daily Compass stated that Japanese soldiers are all arrogant fools. These people are not bound by the government's peaceful policies. Once there is an opportunity, they will expand their theft of power in North China.</p>
<p>• The French Socialist Party's official newspaper, Le Populaire, stated that Japan wants to resolve local incidents, but it is also applying pressure to China and forcing the country's central government to accept political demands. What Japan is seeking is first the four northeastern provinces, and now the two provinces of Hebei and Chahar. Although the locations are different, the desires and methods adopted are always the same.</p>
<p>The above remarks regarding Japan's current aggression and arrogance are not the angry remarks of our invaded country. They are the remarks of a third party, seeing the inside story clearly and speaking out for injustice. As the saying goes, onlookers see more than players. At this point, even if one tries to conceal or cover up, it will be in vain. Based on these observations and remarks, the responsibility for the Lugouqiao Incident is self-evident and requires no further elaboration.</p>
<p>Assuming that this incident cannot be resolved and continues to expand, I am now not planning for our country first, but planning for the Japanese side first. Whether it is beneficial or harmful to Japan is difficult to say. After all, since the September 18th and February 26th incidents, the arrogance and arbitrary power of the military have been unprecedented. No matter who forms the cabinet, if they do not accept the conditions of the military, they will be unable to maintain it. Moreover, the Kwantung Army stationed in China and the garrison army stationed in Hebei and Chahar create incidents to gain merit and act arrogantly. Even the government may not be able to stop their actions. Under these circumstances, to still consider it an orderly country, I dare not believe. I dare not believe that this situation can be maintained permanently. Therefore, regardless of whether Japan wins by luck in this war, the arrogance of the military will become even more rampant, and the government will have to clean it up somehow. Assuming the result is defeat, Japan's vitality will be injured and difficult to recover for a while, and it will be criticized by public opinion in various countries. I am deeply worried about Japan. I wonder if those wise people in the Japanese government and public have ever thought about this.</p>

<p>[New York] Soviet pilot Gromov, who departed from Moscow on July 12 and came to the United States via the North Pole, has flown over San Francisco today and landed. He continues to fly towards San Diego. This trip by Gromov has broken the world record for long-distance non-stop flight. The current record was set by French pilots Rossi and Codous in 1933, flying from New York to Rayak in Syria, a distance of 5,657 miles. It is estimated that the flight from Moscow to San Diego is approximately 6,700 miles long. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] Los Angeles radio station received a telegram from Soviet pilot Gromov at 11:40 AM today (Greenwich Time), but the content is unknown due to the unknown code. It is generally believed that Gromov's plane is still continuing to fly south. Based on the fuel it carries, it should be able to continue flying until 4:00 PM. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] This morning at 6:00 AM, it was heard that Soviet Russian pilot Gromov and his two companions had flown near Los Angeles or San Diego, but there was no confirmed news.

Two minutes later, the plane sent another wireless message, asking whether it should fly along the Pacific coast or continue flying east of the Canadian Rocky Mountains to avoid bad weather. The authorities replied by telegram, advising it to continue flying east. Therefore, the plane will head towards Montana in the United States and then turn to San Francisco. It is generally believed that the plane does not intend to land before arriving in San Francisco. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Georgia Republic Uncovers Spies</h3>
<p>Another Seven Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>[Paris] According to a report from a correspondent of Le Petit Parisien stationed in Moscow, seven spies attempted to assassinate the leader of the Georgian Communist Party and Stalin's close aide Beria, and the chairman of the People's Committee of Internal Affairs, Yezhov. After being uncovered, they were recently sentenced to death. The seven were related to the Menshevik faction and anti-communist elements and colluded with a certain foreign country, but the country was not announced. Their purpose was to overthrow the Soviet system and separate Georgia from the Soviet Union to build a capitalist country. According to the Soviet Union's Dawn of the East newspaper, after this assassination plot was uncovered in February of this year, they were prosecuted under emergency legal procedures for engaging in sabotage, rebellion, espionage, and terrorist activities. The leader of the seven, named Mdivani, came from an old Russian aristocratic family. There are also many other accomplices who have now fled abroad.

<h3>Sino-Japanese Conflict Affects Anglo-Japanese Negotiations</h3>
<p>Kadono Expresses Concern</p>
<p>[London] The Japanese economic investigation team and the Federation of British Industries are conducting talks here. Both are paying attention to the Sino-Japanese dispute and hope that it can be resolved locally. Kadono Shigejiro, the leader of the Japanese economic investigation team, recently told a reporter from Havas that "This dispute is purely local in nature, and I firmly believe that both sides will be able to obtain a satisfactory solution." Officials from the Federation of British Industries are deeply concerned that the current situation in North China is sufficient to hinder the Anglo-Japanese talks, and that the economic cooperation between China and Japan may also be adversely affected. They also said that the future situation will depend on whether the current dispute can be localized or will expand. However, it is extremely unfortunate that this dispute occurred at this time. The Japanese economic investigation team is scheduled to continue talks with the Federation of British Industries on the 16th of this month, and will travel to Liverpool, Manchester, and Glasgow for inspection within the next week for about a week. Then, they will return here. It is generally hoped that the current dispute between China and Japan will be resolved by then so that the current talks between Britain and Japan can proceed smoothly.

<h3>French Socialist Party Congress</h3>
<p>Important Resolutions Passed, Congress Closes, Ratifying Party Members' Participation in Current Cabinet</p>
<p>⊙ Marseille The National Congress of the Socialist Party continued its meeting all night yesterday. After parliamentarians Bracke and Bivaut, from the left-wing revolutionary faction, read out their respective motions, the congress immediately, at the request of Minister of State Blum, divided the draft resolution proposed by Blum and Minister without Portfolio Faure into three sections for voting. The first section was to ratify the measures taken by the previous Blum cabinet during its year in power. It passed by a majority of 4,539 votes to 19 votes, with 828 abstentions. The second section was to ratify the participation of some Socialist Party members in the Chautemps cabinet. Regarding this section, Blum declared, "The congress has the highest authority, and we should obey the decisions of the congress. However, you should also submit to the judgment of the majority. Therefore, the congress should make a clear decision by voting." Thus, the congress decided on a voting method, where voters could choose one of the two options: "Socialist Party cabinet members should continue to serve as cabinet members" and "Socialist Party cabinet members should withdraw from the current cabinet." The voting results showed that 3,484 votes favored continuing to serve as cabinet members, 1,866 votes favored withdrawing from the current cabinet, and 43 abstained. The third section was the Socialist Party's future political platform, which was further divided into three proposals: one was the draft resolution of Blum and Faure, one was the proposal of Bracke and Zyromski, and one was the proposal of Bivaut. The voting results showed that the draft resolution of Blum and Faure passed by a majority of 3,949 votes, while the proposal of Bracke and Zyromski received only 1,545 votes, and the proposal of Bivaut received only 894 votes. Then, the congress adjourned for a moment and elected members of the Socialist Party's Standing Administrative Committee, totaling 33 seats. The Blum and Faure faction won 18 seats, the Bracke and Zyromski faction won 9 seats, and the Bivaut faction won 6 seats. Blum was still appointed as the manager of the Socialist Party's newspaper, "Le Populaire," and the deputy manager will be appointed later. At 3:00 AM, the 34th National Congress of the Socialist Party was declared closed amidst the singing of the Internationale. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

The International Trade Group is headed by Gawehn and is responsible for developing and encouraging international trade, and maintaining close contact with the National Socialist Party's foreign organizations. The Steel-Iron Industry was originally managed by the "Raw Material Allocation Group," but now a separate department will be set up, headed by Hanneken. This new arrangement is said to be the result of the resignation of the head of the Raw Material Allocation Group, Premier and Finance Minister Kehrl of Baden, due to heavy workload.

<h3>Rumor of German Volunteers Continuing to Open Spain to Help Fight</h3>
<p>Military Supplies Constantly Transported to Support, Government Troops Attacking Suburbs of Capital Win</p>
<p>[London] The Manchester Guardian recently revealed, "A large number of German volunteers have gone to Spain in the past month and this month. These volunteers departed from the port of Hamburg, claiming to be tourists or athletes, but in fact, they are all technicians and aircraft pilots. The Spanish Nationalist Army needs technicians and aircraft pilots more than infantry units. As for various military supplies, they continue to be transported from the port of Hamburg without stopping. On the 9th of this month, a Danish ship departed from the port of Hamburg to Spain, carrying aircraft, tanks, and other military supplies, all packed in boxes, marked on the outside as 'chocolate'. Recently, many German ships have changed their names and hoisted the flags of Central and South American countries, carrying military supplies to Spain. For example, the German ship 'Amalienburg' is now renamed 'Achem' and flies the Panamanian flag, while the 'Schyerg' is renamed 'Marathon' and uses the Peruvian flag. There are also 15 German fishing boats that have changed their names, equipped with weapons, and departed from the port of Hamburg to Spain." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>France and the Vatican Cooperate to Safeguard Peace</h3>
<p>Agreement Reached, Vatican Secretary of State Returns to Rome</p>
<p>⊙ Paris Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pacelli came here to preside over the opening ceremony of the Vatican Pavilion at the International Exposition and went to Lisieux to preside over the completion ceremony of the cathedral. The ceremonies have now been completed, and he returned to Rome by evening today. Before his departure, President Lebrun hosted a banquet in his honor at the Presidential Palace, and then held talks with Prime Minister Chautemps, Foreign Minister Delbos, and others. Recently, German newspapers fabricated various unfounded rumors about Cardinal Pacelli's mission to France, claiming that "British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Pacelli in France at the end of last week." Cardinal Pacelli was outraged upon hearing this. During the talks between Pacelli and Delbos today, they first exchanged views on the general situation in Europe, believing that the key to the European situation lies in Germany. Secondly, they discussed various outstanding issues between France and the Vatican. Both sides believed that the current relationship between the two sides is sincere, friendly, and without any suspicion. Observers generally believe that both France and the Vatican maintain that it is not necessary to conclude a concordat. Although France has not concluded a concordat with the Vatican, based on past experience, some countries have signed concordats but still violated them. As for France, although it has not signed a concordat, it actually complies with the provisions that should be included in a concordat, showing that it is not necessary for both sides to conclude a concordat. As for the Catholic Church's missionary work overseas, France has always been the leader among all countries, sparing no effort to protect missionaries. This is also agreed upon by both the Vatican and the French government. In addition, the most important thing is the issue of cooperation between France and the Vatican to safeguard peace. The speeches of Cardinal Pacelli at the banquets he attended during his visit to France are sufficient to prove that the Vatican and the French government are in complete agreement on the methods of safeguarding and organizing peace.

<h3>Palestine Partition Plan</h3>
<p>Opposition Voices Rise</p>
<p>⊙ Cairo Egyptian newspapers strongly oppose the creation of a new Jewish state, demanding that all Arab countries immediately take effective measures to prevent the implementation of the partition plan. The only thing that the Arabs consider effective is the promise made by the British government in 1915. If the previous promise is not fulfilled, the entire faith of the Arabs will be shaken. (National Maritime News, 14th)</p>
<p>[London] Jabotinsky, the president of the New Zionist Organization, said in a speech to members of the House of Commons today that the land given to the Jews in the Palestine partition plan is too small in area and is not enough to accommodate the Jews expelled from various countries who return to Palestine. The Jews' ideals of expansion will also be cut off from now on. Furthermore, the land obtained by the Jews is very fertile and will inevitably be envied by the neighboring Arabs. They will not be satisfied until they seize the Jews' land. Therefore, if incidents occur in the empire in the future, this will be the source of the disaster. Mr. Jabotinsky said that in the past 15 years, the total capital invested by Jews in Palestine has reached 35 million pounds. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 13th)</p>

<h3>Relationship Between Land Law and Fisheries Law, Judicial Yuan Explains Doubts</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Judicial Yuan explained the ambiguities in the relationship between the Land Law and the Fisheries Law: ㊀ Non-public waters may be privately owned. Those that are integrated with public waters may also be divided into boundaries for non-public parts and requested to be registered in accordance with the provisions of the Land Law regarding land ownership registration. ㊁ After non-public waters are divided from public waters, unless the occupier or owner wants to obtain fishing rights on the water surface, they should register for fisheries in accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the Fisheries Law and Article 1 of the Fisheries Registration Rules. For any other purpose, no separate fisheries registration is required when registering land ownership. If it is desired to restrict or abolish the fishing use of others, it is sufficient to request approval from the competent administrative agency in accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the Fisheries Law. ㊂ In addition to registering in accordance with the Fisheries Registration Rules, fisheries rights do not need to be registered for land ownership. Although the Fisheries Law recognizes fisheries rights as real rights and applies the provisions of the Civil Code on land by analogy, since this real right is different in nature from land ownership, and the Fisheries Law and fisheries registration provisions only list one type of mortgage right, other real rights that are incompatible with the nature of fisheries rights are naturally not applicable by analogy.

<h3>British and French Newspapers Comment on the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Hoping that China and Japan Will Deal With It With a Broad Vision</p>
<p>[London] The London Daily Telegraph published an editorial today commenting on the situation in North China, saying that the new cabinet in Tokyo has not been established for long, and the Japanese military is thinking of forcing it. China is one method in Japan's political gambling game. It must be known that this kind of gambling game has large ins and outs, which is no different from the contest between democracy and fascism. This is left to Japan's own affairs and should not be the cause of international disputes. The purpose of recent talks between Britain and Japan is to restore the diplomatic relations between the two sides that existed before the Japanese army forcibly occupied Manchuria. In these talks, China will of course be the main event to be discussed. A good government and the security resulting from this government are necessary in China's huge market. This is not only beneficial to Britain, but also to Japan. However, the current conflict in North China will make this exciting and good atmosphere completely lost. Therefore, it is hoped that both Nanjing and Tokyo will deal with this situation with a spirit of reconciliation and a broad vision. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>[London] The Daily Herald commented on the overall situation in North China, saying that if a new war breaks out in the Far East, it will become a catastrophe. The United Kingdom and the United States should take joint action quickly to stop Japan's dangerous attempts. The result of this dangerous attempt cannot be foreseen by the impetuous military. Today's events are a new stage in the consequences of the extreme weakness of Geneva's handling of the Sino-Japanese issue five years ago. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>[Paris] French newspapers are quite concerned about the disputes between China and Japan. The "Paris Echo" recently published a commentary saying, "Moreover, the current situation is extremely dangerous. The reason is that one of the two countries, China and Japan, has an enthusiastic and angry public, and the other has a powerful army, and neither is willing to give in." "L'Époque" reported, "The United Kingdom, the United States, and France are now preparing to conduct investigations in Nanjing and Tokyo. Once it is ascertained that Japan is indeed trying to implement an aggressive policy, it will express its firm opposition to it." "Le Jour" reported, "The diplomatic activities conducted by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France regarding the situation between China and Japan are not alarming. What these countries hope is that their political and commercial rights in North China will be respected." "Le Figaro" saw the opposite of "Le Jour." According to the battle report, "The scope of the dispute should be limited and not allowed to expand. If it is not too late, it must be applied with strong diplomatic pressure to be effective." "L'Intransigeant" wrote, "European and American countries should adopt a prudent policy. The situation in the Far East is very dangerous, and the conflicts between the Chinese and Japanese armies may also be peacefully resolved." "Le Temps" expressed doubts about Japan's implementation of an adventurous policy, briefly stating, "The result of the conflict between China and Japan will only allow other countries to reap the benefits. Japan may therefore fall into the abyss of darkness." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>After the Lugouqiao Incident, the Traitors in Chahar Province Showed Signs of Restlessness</h3>
<p>Actively Taking Action Against Suiyuan, Adopting a Combination of Appeasement and Attack Against the People's Army, A Certain Army Division Arrives West of Chengde as Backup</p>
<p>Zhangbei Correspondence: A certain party, relying on force, has created various special zones in North China to achieve its ambitions of gradual encroachment and to complete its continental policy, resulting in the fragmentation of our administrative and territorial integrity. Because its new cabinet was formed and the political situation stabilized, it has reiterated its old tune of the three principles, expanded the puppet organization in Eastern Hebei, strengthened the traitorous group in Northern Chahar, and hired a large number of hooligans and traitors to create disturbances in Peiping and Tianjin. Such news is spreading like wildfire, and various parties are in doubt when the Lugouqiao Incident suddenly occurred. On the evening of the 8th, it was transmitted here from inside the Pass. People generally said that the bandits and puppets who had been dormant for a long time, under the support of a certain party, would definitely make some kind of gesture as a response to the Lugouqiao Incident. As expected, the news of their restlessness has now been confirmed. I will now report the recent news from various sources as follows:</p>
<p>The Impact of the Lugouqiao Incident</p>
<p>Before the Lugouqiao Incident, there was the following rumor here: "Japan has decided to threaten Suiyuan and Shanxi with air force to protect the puppet organizations in Eastern Hebei and Northern Chahar, to protect Northern Chahar, and to threaten Hebei and Chahar with navy. It also plans to increase the number of troops stationed in North China to about two divisions, with the area from Lutai to Tongxian as the defense zone for these newly added troops. Taking the opportunity, a large number of hooligans and traitors will be distributed in the Peiping and Tianjin area to create a panic attitude as an excuse for their military actions, and to stage another 'September 18th' Incident." After the Lugouqiao Incident, there was another rumor saying: "If diplomatic channels are followed, the Hebei and Chahar authorities will be the target of negotiations. However, Song Zheyuan, the leader of the Hebei and Chahar authorities, has been staying in his hometown for a long time, and Ambassador Kawagoe is scheduled to come north. Japanese soldiers fear that after Kawagoe arrives in Peiping, it will be difficult to find a negotiation partner, so they deliberately created the Lugouqiao Incident to urge Song's return to Peiping." The rumors are like this, but I dare not judge whether Japan's intentions are like this. Furthermore, after the Lugouqiao Incident, the general traitors here, under the manipulation of Japan, are quite restless. As for the people, because the situation is isolated and the truth is unclear, there has not yet been any kind of expression.</p>
<p>The Bandits and Puppets in Northern Chahar Take the Opportunity to Make Trouble</p>
<p>According to news from a certain related party on the evening of the 9th, the bandits and puppets in Northern Chahar originally planned to hold a memorial service at Jiabu Temple on the 10th of this month to commemorate the traitors who sacrificed for Japan's continental policy in the Battle of Bailing Temple last year. On the 8th, a certain special service agency suddenly sent urgent telegrams to various places, saying that the memorial service would be held one day earlier (i.e., the 9th) at Jiabu Temple, ostensibly as a memorial service, but in reality, to hold an important secret meeting. At noon on that day, the memorial service passed in a hurry. The head of a certain special service agency immediately summoned the traitorous leaders such as Prince De to hold an emergency secret meeting at his private residence. The content is unknown, but it is vaguely heard that they will take active actions against Suiyuan, and against the people's army, they have decided to adopt a combination of appeasement and attack in the near future, while their resources are not yet sufficient, so as to avoid future troubles. At the same time, another message said that a division of Japanese troops has arrived in Rehe and Chengde, and there are reports that they will immediately move west to back up the bandits and puppets in Northern Chahar.</p>
<p>The Public's Sentiment Towards the Traitors</p>
<p>Since Prince De's failed westward invasion last year, he has been greatly resented by the people of the League and Banner. Recently, he has been silently observing the sentiments of the people in various places. Except for the West Sunite Banner, most of them have adopted a negative and resistant attitude towards Prince De. In particular, the people of the East Ujimqin and West Ujimqin Banners are the most resistant. A few days ago, a certain party sent 30 soldiers, along with salesmen from the Great Meng Company, to the East and West Ujimqin Banners to persuade the people to buy and use their products. At the same time, they also used traitors to give lectures and propaganda, but the result was still ineffective. This phenomenon occurred after the People's Self-Defense Army started its activities on June 1st. Prince De himself also knows that this situation is very detrimental to him. He once gathered all the League princes, dukes, and chief stewards at Jiabu Temple, recounted the hardships of his personal attachment to the enemy, and asked them to convey to the people to be more understanding. His words were mostly absurd and not worth considering.</p>
<p>New Methods of Enslaving the People</p>
<p>Since the People's Self-Defense Army of Northern Chahar launched its movement, a certain party's methods of enslaving the people have been newer and more cruel. According to the villagers of Shibatatai, Chongli County, the club donations collected by the club are collected by a certain party's instructor every five days. Recently, each time they collect money, they bring a large number of cigarettes, food, etc., and summon the local security team and the people to talk. What they say is mostly exaggerating the greatness of their country's power, and they do their best to deceive and intimidate. After the speech, they ask the people all over the place, "Are you afraid of Japan?" If they answer directly that they are not afraid, they will be detained lightly, and robbed and killed heavily. If they answer that they are afraid, they will be called good people and rewarded with cigarettes and sweets. This is also a new method of enslaving the people by a certain party after June 1st.

<h3>The Garrison in Huixian County Annihilates a Drug Den</h3>
<p>More Than a Dozen Drug Bandits Killed, A Large Number of Drugs Seized</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Correspondence: The border between Henan and Shanxi has always been known as the world of drugs. There are many drug-making institutions in Linxian, Huixian, Qixian and other counties, and they are often cracked down. Recently, the authorities reported that in Xigueda, the fourth district of Huixian County, there were more than 30 bandits including Yang Laoxiu, hiding in the mountains, hiding guns and making drugs. The Henan Anti-Smoking Commissioner's Office, together with the Henan-Anhui Border Pacification Office of the Provincial Government, ordered the special commissioner's offices of the third and fourth districts of Henan and the relevant counties to investigate and handle the matter strictly, and also sent a letter to the Shanxi Provincial Government to jointly suppress it. The Anti-Smoking Commissioner Wu Wangji believed that the drug den in northern Henan was of great importance to the future of the anti-smoking policy. When inspecting northern Henan, he went to Xinxiang to discuss the suppression methods with Army Commander Pang Bingxun and the local Administrative Commissioner Wang Yinxi. At that time, Pang's department had been ordered by the Pacification Office to station in Liuying, Huixian County, to handle the suppression. After the department arrived, it learned that Yang's bandits led their party members to occupy the Jinding Mountain in the northeast corner of Xigueda Village, and immediately deployed a fierce attack. The bandits stubbornly resisted on the mountain, and after an hour of fierce fighting, more than half of the bandits were wounded and fled in panic. A total of 14 bandits were killed, more than a dozen rifles, pistols and revolvers were seized, 300 packets of drugs, half a bag of pills and two taels of loose medicine, and drug-making machines and other items were seized. The bandit leader Yang Laoxiu has fled into Shanxi Province. Pang Bingxun gave the battalion 150 yuan as a reward for its effective suppression to show encouragement. When Wu Wangji heard the news, he went to the military headquarters to express his condolences to Pang, and planned to ask the provincial government for a reward. (12th)</p>
<h3>The Plainclothes Team of the Japanese Concession in Tianjin Attacked the Chinese Concession Without Success</h3>
<p>Dozens of Gunshots Fired in the Southern City Before Fleeing, Our Side is on Strict Alert, and People's Hearts are Stable</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops at Lugouqiao in the suburbs of Peiping, according to investigation, was a pre-planned plan by the Japanese side. The Japanese Army Headquarters in Tianjin established a temporary combat section in May in the name of a large-scale exercise, dispatching all troops, intending to launch a military operation in the suburbs of Peiping and occupy Peiping when our side was unprepared. Another plainclothes team attacked Tianjin. After Peiping and Tianjin were captured, negotiations would be conducted to coerce our side to accept unreasonable demands. In mid-June, the Japanese Army Headquarters in Tianjin secretly organized a plainclothes team in the Japanese Concession, and set up offices in the International Apartment, Beiyang Hotel, Asian Hotel and other places in the Concession, recruiting hooligans and providing them with training, with each person receiving 60 cents of living expenses per day. On the night of the 7th of this month, after the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, this plainclothes team of about 600 people was all moved to the Japanese barracks in Haiguang Temple, and a plainclothes team command headquarters was established there. Each person was issued a gun and prepared to move out. At noon on the 11th, the Japanese troops at Lugouqiao violated their promise and not only did not withdraw to Fengtai, but also launched a fierce attack on our positions with artillery and machine guns, and the conflict broke out again. The Japanese Army in Tianjin believed that the time had come, and dispatched the plainclothes team to move out. It was originally planned to launch an attack on the Chinese Concession from the southeast corner of the city and Luzhuangzi in the southern city from the Japanese Concession at 9:00 pm on the 11th, with the regular Japanese army providing assistance afterwards. However, due to unpreparedness, it was postponed until 3:00 am on the 12th before a small number of vanguards were dispatched. Because our security team had extremely solid equipment at the junction of the southeast corner of the city and Luzhuangzi between China and Japan, the ragtag plainclothes team did not dare to advance easily. They temporarily changed their attack to a small number of plainclothes teams sneaking out of the alleys near Guangshan Street and Yijin Lane in the southern city, firing more than a dozen gunshots at the Chinese Concession. Fortunately, our security team in Yijin Lane also had defenses. Because the plainclothes team that fired the shots had not yet entered the Chinese Concession, they did not return fire. The plainclothes team was originally composed of local ruffians and hooligans who did not understand military affairs. Their fundamental purpose was to swindle money from the Japanese. There was absolutely no courage to sacrifice their lives. After firing a few shots, they fled with their heads in their hands. However, merchants and residents in the southern city were all panicked when they heard the sound. The Tianjin Police Bureau officially notified the Japanese side after discovering the plainclothes team, asking them to investigate the people who fired shots in the southern city and not to allow similar incidents to occur again, causing the situation to deteriorate. If the plainclothes team sneaking out of the Japanese Concession fired shots and caused disturbances again, our police team would definitely pursue them. The Japanese side should be responsible for whatever situation results. It was found that during the Tianjin Incident in the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Japanese side hired a plainclothes team to attack Dongmalu. This time, they played their despicable and shameful tricks again, but they were unsuccessful. However, they must be unwilling, so the public security in Tianjin is extremely serious. At the moment, the Mayor of Tianjin Zhang Zizhong and the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Ma Yanchong are both in Peiping temporarily. Li Wentian, the Director of the Tianjin Police Bureau and Deputy Division Commander of the 38th Division of the 29th Army, together with Liu Jialuan, the Commander of the Tianjin Security, are sitting in Tianjin. The city has 3,000 security teams, which are sufficient to maintain public security. The troops stationed in the suburbs of Tianjin can also be dispatched at any time. Martial law will not be declared unless it is absolutely necessary. At present, people's hearts are still very stable (12th)</p>

<p>Gu Yinchang, a resident of Yudai Town in this county, was handed over to the County Hospital for investigation during the first district's verification of reformed opium addicts on May 30 because he was suspected of relapsing. The result was that he was poisonous and addicted. Gu refused to accept the hospital's appraisal and filed a complaint with the Provincial Government, the Provincial Anti-Smoking Association, and the Special Commissioner's Office of the Second District, accusing the County Hospital of sloppy handling and plotting to frame him. The province sent someone to Kunshan to investigate thoroughly. It is now learned that the Provincial Legislative Yuan chemically tested Gu's urine bottle, and the result was that it did show a morphine positive reaction. The county was ordered to handle it according to law. It is now learned that the case was judged on the 14th. Gu Yinchang relapsed after quitting opium, and was sentenced to one year of fixed-term imprisonment and fined 150 yuan. If the fine is commuted to labor service, it will be calculated at two yuan per day.</p>

<p>At about 5:00 on the 12th of this month, a southbound train on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway ran over a pedestrian, Zhou Baoqing, outside the West Gate of Xiaoshan.

Because the connection line is more difficult, it will not be fully completed until the end of October. On November 1st, the joint transportation between Shangrao and Guangzhou can be directly reached. The public and railway roads on both sides of the Qianjiang River have been connected to each other, and vehicles can travel back and forth without hindrance.</p>

<p>The military police and administrative agencies in this county recently received an order from the Yu-Wan District Pacification Commissioner's Office, which roughly stated that although there are no large-scale bandits and reds in this pacification area, it is feared that there are scattered bandits, traitors, and communists lurking in secret, taking the opportunity to make trouble and endangering public security. Now, the regulations for maintaining local public security during the green gauze account period are hereby promulgated to the garrisons, medical officers, and all police and administrative agencies in this area for strict detection and effective prevention.

After the mediation of Wang Peishi, the county magistrate of Hefei, Tong Xingsun, the special commissioner of the Party Department, Fei Yongzhang, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and Liu Junyao, the principal of Zhengyi Middle School, Chairman Liu has accepted and stated his concessions for the five articles in a compromise manner.

<p>The Zhenbao Highway from the provincial capital to Baoyan is being built by the Zhenjiang County Construction Bureau. The roadbed has been laid and completed.

<h3>Li Guang'an, Representative of the 29th Army, Visits Sun Ke and Song Ziwen</h3>
<p>Reports on the War Situation and Requests for Calls to Action and Assistance. According to Discussions, Hopes for Peaceful Negotiations are Very Slim.</p>
<p>As the war in the North intensifies, with the Japanese dispatching troops and generals, it has almost become a situation where they cannot back down. In order to establish contact with various parties, the 29th Army is regularly reporting the situation at the front through its representatives stationed in Beijing and Shanghai. Li Guang'an, the head of the representative office of the army in Shanghai, visited Sun Ke, the president of the Legislative Yuan, Yang Hu, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Council, and Du Yuesheng, a prominent figure in Shanghai, to report on the situation and request calls to action and assistance. According to Mr. Li, he has repeatedly received telegrams from Qin Dechun, the mayor of Beiping, stating that the Japanese side has repeatedly violated agreements and is continuing to send troops to invade the suburbs of Beiping. Although peaceful negotiations are still ongoing, hopes are very slim. The morale of our army is extremely high, and they are determined to die in defense.

<h3>Association Against Buying and Selling Smuggled Goods Telegrams Compatriots to Boycott Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>Increasing the Strength to Resist the Enemy. Telegram Encourages Anti-Japanese Soldiers.</p>

<h3>Chinese Red Cross Sends Team to Lugou for Rescue</h3>
<p>North China Branch Handles Deployment in Two Groups. Pang Jingzhou Travels to Lushan to Visit Chiang, Returns to Shanghai Today or Tomorrow.</p>
<p>In response to the unprovoked provocation by the Japanese army at Lugou Bridge, which resulted in the shelling of Wanping City and clashes with our army, causing numerous casualties among soldiers and civilians, the Shanghai headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society urgently telegraphed its North China branch to quickly organize a rescue team to go to the Lugou Bridge area for rescue work. A reply telegram has been received confirming that the team has already departed. The reporter from the Shenshi News Agency provides the following details:</p>
<p>Urgent Telegram to North China</p>
<p>During the previous Suiyuan War, the Chinese Red Cross Society Headquarters sent staff from its Rescue Committee to Suiyuan to organize the North China Branch of the Rescue Committee to engage in rescue work. In light of the sudden outbreak of the conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops at Lugou Bridge, the Shanghai headquarters believes that sending personnel from Shanghai is necessary and therefore urgently telegraphed the North China branch to inquire about the local situation and instruct them to quickly organize a rescue team to implement rescue work at the front lines.</p>
<p>Deployment in Two Groups</p>
<p>Subsequently, a reply telegram was received from the branch, stating that it had already publicized the rescue and was actively preparing for departure soon. The organization is divided into two groups: one for severely injured patients and one for rescue work. Another telegram was received the following day, stating that they had already departed and that all matters would be reported to Mayor Qin Dechun and Commander Feng Zhi'an of Beiping for instructions. At the same time, the Red Cross Society has branches in Beiping, Tianjin, and other places. After the incident, it is reported that the two cities of Beiping and Tianjin have also dispatched personnel to join the North China branch for a joint departure. Therefore, it has not yet been determined whether the Shanghai headquarters needs to send personnel to the front lines.</p>
<p>Pang's Trip to Lushan</p>
<p>Dr. Pang Jingzhou, the director-general of the association, was previously summoned by Chairman Chiang to Lushan to prepare for the establishment of a temporary summer clinic in Lushan. The preparations have been completed, and the clinic has officially opened. Dr. Pang, having completed his work in Lushan and due to the urgent matters awaiting him at the Shanghai headquarters, is scheduled to return to Shanghai today or tomorrow to handle all matters. Whether the headquarters will send additional staff to the Lugou Bridge battlefield to assist in rescue work will also depend on Dr. Pang's decision.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Temporarily Suspends Northern Routes</h3>
<p>Scheduled Routes Temporarily Suspended. Foreign Steamships Take the Opportunity to Transport Goods.</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of the war in North China, rumors of both war and peace spread. However, the war has not yet ceased. Since this Tuesday, the shipment of large quantities of grains and flour from Shanghai to Tianjin and Tanggu has been suspended. Foreign commercial steamships operating from Shanghai to North China, such as those of the Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nissin companies, are still operating as usual because they are foreign-owned. Among the Chinese steamships operating to North China, only the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has formal scheduled routes. Yesterday, the company decided to temporarily suspend its northern routes. The company's Tai Gu steamship, which was originally scheduled to depart for Tianjin yesterday, has now been ordered to sail to Jinjiang to load cargo. At the same time, the company will observe the situation for the next day or two before deciding whether to resume operations to North China. If the war in the north does not cease, the steamship will no longer sail to Tianjin and will change its route to another destination. Furthermore, the Zheng Ban steamship Xin Ming, which was originally scheduled to sail to North China, has been decided to change its route to Fuzhou and Nantai, also temporarily suspending operations to Tianjin. It is also reported that the Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, and North China routes are crowded with passengers and cargo, and Taikoo has temporarily added steamships Huan Yang and Lu Zhou, while Jardine Matheson's Ri Sheng steamship is reportedly transporting large quantities of flour to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Gao Zongwu Returns to Nanjing Despite Illness</h3>
<p>Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gao Zongwu, returned to Shanghai last month for medical treatment. Due to the tense situation between China and Japan, he returned to Nanjing yesterday evening despite his illness. Before his departure, he told reporters that he had been working hard in recent years and had been feeling tired since spring. In May, he occasionally had a fever, but he continued to work despite his illness. By early June, he felt unable to continue and had no choice but to come to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 23rd of last month to recuperate at the Hongqiao Sanatorium. His condition improved significantly. He had originally planned to return to Nanjing on the 4th to travel to Lushan and participate in the conference, but his body suddenly felt unwell again before his departure, and he had a high fever. He then transferred to the Sacred Heart Sanatorium and consulted with Dr. Zhang Youmei for treatment. After the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred on the 8th, he immediately planned to return to Nanjing that night. However, he was persuaded by officials in the ministry via telegram to rest and recuperate, and his doctors and relatives also strongly advised against travel. Therefore, he temporarily remained in Shanghai. Now that the situation is becoming increasingly tense, he is returning to Nanjing this evening, regardless of everything.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing the Government Bond Market and Thoroughly Investigating Speculation</h3>
<p>Municipal Government and Social Affairs Bureau to Intervene.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the market price of government bonds in Shanghai has recently plummeted. The Shanghai Municipal Government believes that the government bond fund is solid and has a long-standing reputation. It should not change due to any accidents. This sharp decline clearly involves speculators who are exploiting the situation and acting recklessly. The government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation and to prosecute the unscrupulous speculators.</p>
<p>A notice issued by the China Merchants Securities Exchange states: "Upon investigation, both parties in a futures transaction are required to pay a margin, as previously stipulated. Effective July 14, the margin for 96 government bonds will be 200 yuan per 10,000 yuan for the physical margin, and the margin for all other types of futures transactions will remain at 400 yuan per 10,000 yuan for the physical margin and will be increased to 600 yuan per 10,000 yuan for the special margin. This notice is hereby issued."</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Expands Shipping Industry, Purchases New Vessels Extensively</h3>
<p>Two American Seagoing Vessels Expected to Arrive by the End of Next Month</p>
<p>This year, the state-run China Merchants Bureau's business on various routes, both coastal and river, has been excellent, especially the Nanhua line, which has seen the greatest profits. Since the opening of international routes, the Haiheng vessel on the Xiamen-Philippines line has, with the assistance of overseas Chinese, exceeded expectations in its trial voyage. The Bureau has felt that all routes have a shortage of vessels given the amount of goods. The Bureau's vessels are insufficient to meet demand everywhere. Consequently, it intended to purchase the Puan vessel from the Navy Department for 300,000 yuan, intending to add it to the Xiamen-Philippines line to replace the Haiheng and expand international routes. Both parties had already agreed, and the deal was about to be finalized. The Bureau was preparing to hire crew members to serve on the Puan. Unexpectedly, the Navy Department needed to keep the ship for transportation purposes and could not sell it, thwarting the plan. To supplement coastal routes and develop overseas shipping, the Bureau had to seek new ships to meet the needs of various routes. It commissioned an American merchant in this port to purchase two vessels suitable for near-sea and ocean routes from the United States to augment the North and South Pacific lines. Yesterday, reliable news was received that two high-speed, new-style seagoing vessels have been purchased from the United States. Each vessel has a load capacity of 3,340 tons. Their appearance and style are similar to the Bureau's existing Haiyuan and other new Sihai vessels, making them extremely suitable for sailing on the North and South Pacific coastal routes. The prices of the two vessels have also been agreed upon, and the delivery of the vessels at sea has been arranged. The two vessels have already set sail from the United States and will also carry cargo on the way to Shanghai for unloading. According to telegrams from the two vessels, they have set sail and are expected to arrive in Shanghai in about a month. At that time, the Bureau will take delivery and change the flag. As for the names of the two new vessels, the Bureau has not yet decided. There are also two vessels suitable for ocean routes, each with a load capacity of 5,500 tons, which are most suitable for sailing between the Xiamen-Philippines line and the South Pacific islands. The Bureau is currently negotiating prices for these vessels. Once an agreement is reached, they will be able to set sail for Shanghai. The Bureau also believes that China is currently experiencing a shortage of funds in its rivers and seas, with demand exceeding supply. Steel prices are rising frequently. Building new vessels would be difficult due to time and economic constraints. Therefore, it is now planned to repair and restore the Guangli and Jiahe vessels, which have been out of service for a long time. This will not only avoid waste and damage but also enable unproductive assets to become productive. These two vessels are slightly old, but their hulls are extremely strong and durable. Once repaired, they will be better than the existing vessels of various private shipping companies. The Bureau has decided to immediately overhaul these two vessels and assign them to the Yangtze River, specifically for transporting large bulk cargo, to avoid incurring huge expenses by chartering other companies' vessels when goods are congested. Engineers have been instructed to plan the repair work. In addition to building the Jinjiang and a Yangtze River steamship this year, the Bureau has also purchased a large number of seagoing vessels, along with repairing old vessels. The Bureau has drastically increased its tonnage on various river and coastal routes, ensuring that there will be no shortage of vessels to meet business needs in the future.</p>
<h3>French Officials and Civilians in Shanghai Celebrated the Democratic Anniversary Yesterday</h3>
<p>Military Parade Held at Gujiazhai Park; Consul-General Hosts Officials from Various Countries at Noon</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 148th anniversary of the French Democratic Republic. French expatriates residing in various parts of China celebrated grandly as usual, especially in Shanghai, where the French Concession was filled with a festive atmosphere. All French consulates, officials, civilians, agencies, companies, and shops took a day off. Trams, buses, and various vehicles also displayed small red, white, and blue national flags, and the national emblem (R.F.RepUblic Francaise) was prominently displayed everywhere to express the celebration. The various celebratory events are detailed below:</p>
<p>Military Parade</p>
<p>The flag-raising ceremony originally scheduled for 8:00 AM at the consulate was canceled. Instead, a military parade was held at Gujiazhai Park starting at 8:00 AM. Participating troops included the Shanghai-based army, navy, combat teams, French Concession police, and the merchant corps. The parade was reviewed by Admiral Piquet, commander of the French Far East Fleet, accompanied by Consul-General Badas. Medals were awarded. Yang Hu, commander of the Songhu Garrison, Central Committee member Chu Minyi, and military attachés and garrison commanders from various countries in Shanghai were invited to attend. Traffic was temporarily closed on the surrounding Lafayette Road and Huanlong Road.</p>
<p>Reception for Foreign Guests</p>
<p>French Consul-General Badas then held a grand tea party at the consulate on Gongguan Road from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM to receive foreign guests and congratulations.

<p>Luncheon and Entertainment</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM, the French General Association on Huanlong Road hosted members and their families and friends. At 1:00 PM, the French Garden General Association on Miersiai Road hosted a luncheon for members. At 4:00 PM, a children's entertainment festival was held at Gujiazhai Park, featuring sports, games, and picnics.</p>
<p>Brilliant Lanterns and Decorations</p>
<p>At 9:00 PM, electric lights and lanterns were lit everywhere. Starting from the Bund on Edward Road, the huge electric light archway there was decorated in gold, green, and red, topped with "R.F." and the phrase "Vive La France" spelled out in white electric lights. The lights on the French warships docked in the Huangpu River reflected each other, attracting the most attention. From there, heading west along Gongguan Road, the lights at the French Consulate were the first to be seen, followed by the buildings of the French Concession Police and Fire Department on Avenue Joffre, all covered in electric lights, creating a dazzling spectacle. At the entrance to Gujiazhai Park on Huanlong Road, the archway was illuminated, attracting crowds of onlookers. Further west, between Miersiai Road and Avenue Joffre, the streets were brightly lit with lanterns. Other major roads, such as Zhaozhong Road and Route Ghisi, were as bright as day. Avenue Joffre was crowded with pedestrians, creating a grand scene. It is reported that Rear Admiral Piquet, commander of the French Far East Fleet, will hold a celebratory reception on the troopship "Pique" at the China Merchants Wharf from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM today.</p>
<h3>Coal Industry to Prevent Profiteering Merchants from Selling Coal to the Enemy</h3>
<p>Emergency Meeting to be Held for Discussion</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association believes that the Sino-Japanese War in North China is intensifying, which will inevitably affect transportation. Most of the coal used in Shanghai is transported from North China. Once transportation is disrupted, Shanghai will experience a coal shortage. Currently, there is not much stock in the market. Recent newspaper reports allege that a certain company is providing coal to the enemy. Therefore, the association plans to convene a joint meeting of all executive supervisors and directors soon to discuss measures to prevent members from providing coal to the enemy and to address the coal shortage in Shanghai if transportation is disrupted. In addition to sending a telegram yesterday to encourage the morale of the soldiers fighting on the front lines, the association will also discuss all forms of material relief at the meeting.</p>
<h3>Registration of Opium Smokers in the Concession Still Under Discussion</h3>
<p>Informal Exchange of Views at the Board Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, the plan for registering opium smokers in the Public Concession will not be formally discussed at today's (14th) afternoon meeting of the Board of Directors. Instead, the directors will only exchange views informally. The Board is still awaiting a report from the special anti-smoking committee organized by the General Director of the Board, Fessenden, lawyer Bohlen, and Police Commissioner Larrard. As Jullard is currently resting in Japan and will not be able to return to Shanghai until September, the report is unlikely to be drafted soon. Reliable sources say that when the six-point resolution is submitted to the Board of Directors for a vote, a majority of the directors will vote against this agreement signed with the China side. Even if the Board approves it, it must still be approved by the consular corps according to custom. It is said that the consular corps will reject the plan for registering opium smokers in the Concession. However, according to well-informed sources, the registration plan will not be terminated even if it is rejected by the Concession authorities. It is reported that the First Special District Court has indicated to the Board of Directors that the court will respect licenses issued to opium smokers in the Concession by the Chinese Anti-Smoking Bureau. In other words, if a resident of the Concession is arrested by the Concession police for smoking opium or carrying opium and is sent to the court, the court will release him as long as he can present an opium smoking license. The reason why the Board of Directors opposes the opium smoker registration plan is that it fears that if opium smoking is allowed in the Concession, the Concession will become a place where unscrupulous individuals seek profit. It also fears that licenses will be used for personal gain, ultimately turning the Concession's anti-smoking plan into a farce. Board Chairman Franklin stated to a Continental Daily reporter yesterday that his attitude towards anti-smoking procedures is the same as towards other Sino-foreign issues, and he always strives to cooperate with the Chinese authorities. He added that the many criticisms from the outside world regarding the licensing plan are mostly due to a lack of understanding of the issue, and that many residents of the Concession do not want to be involved in the drug issue. According to news from the Board of Directors' Information Office, Director Fessenden gave a report on the drug issue at yesterday's (14th) meeting of the Board. As the Police Commissioner is currently on sick leave, the Board of Directors decided to form a small committee to further study the issue.</p>
<h3>Delegation to Present Sword to Leader Set to Depart for Lushan</h3>
<p>Expressing Support for the Leader</p>
<p>The students of the third Shanghai Citywide Training Corps believe that National Leader Chiang Kai-shek has dedicated his life to the country, struggling arduously to lead the nation towards the path of revival. His great achievements are admired by people at home and abroad. Therefore, they raised funds to forge a sword to present to the Leader, expressing their respect and belief in him and their support for him. The details of this plan have been reported in previous newspapers. The sword has now been forged, and the method of presentation will be for each of the 37 companies of the Citywide Training Corps to send one representative (with the female company sending two representatives, totaling 38 people) to form a delegation to present the sword. It is reported that the delegation, led by Chief Representative Xiong Ying, will depart for Lushan on the 16th of this month to present the sword.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Xun Line Increases Number of Flights</h3>
<p>Four Round Trips per Week Starting from the 11th of this Month</p>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1421: It has been verified that China National Aviation Corporation is operating special flights between Shanghai and Hankou and on the Nanjing-Xun line, as announced in this Bureau's Notices Nos. 1415 and 1417. This Bureau has now received a letter from the company stating that the Shanghai-Xun line will be increased to four round trips per week starting from the 11th of this month, i.e., every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, departing from Shanghai in the morning, passing through Nanjing to Xunyang, and returning from Xunyang via Nanjing to Shanghai in the afternoon, with no change in the schedule.

<h3>Shanghai-Beiping Train Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>First Train After Interruption; Carried Over Thirty British, American, and French Expats; No Shanghai-Beiping Train Departed Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Shishi News Agency, due to the Lugouqiao Incident, the joint Shanghai-Beiping train service has only been running to Tianjin for the past few days. One train arrived in Shanghai at 7:40 AM yesterday, the only such service since the Lugouqiao Incident. Due to obstacles between Beiping and Tianjin, the train was severely delayed. It carried over thirty British, American, and French expats. According to sources at the Railway Bureau, the Shanghai-Beiping train departed from Beiping yesterday morning and may arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning. Although both railway bureaus can still sell tickets for Beiping, it will only be possible to determine whether it can reach Beiping after reaching Tianjin. In addition, the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Beiping express flight still flew from Tianjin yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at approximately 5:00 PM. A northbound flight was originally scheduled for yesterday but was temporarily canceled.</p>

<h3>The Inside Story of Shao Yueru's Fraud Case Still Needs Investigation</h3>
<p>Shao Says Settlement Was Done by His Son; Kuai Shaoqing Denies Filing Criminal Lawsuit</p>
<p>Shao Yueru, a shareholder of the closed Yangqinghe Jiuyinlou (Old Jiuyinlou Silver Shop) from Shaoxing, was recently reported to the General Police Station by creditors of the silver shop, Guo Zhouxiao, Shi Yiji, Kang Renchu, and Kuai Shaoqing, for allegedly committing fraud and damaging creditor rights, causing them to suffer losses of 92,532.78 yuan. Based on the report, the police sued Shao in the First Special District Court. Details of a previous hearing have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo continued the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. Shao Yueru was still defended by lawyer Fan Gang. First, police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated that the plaintiffs had a total of over 110,000 yuan in deposits at Yangqinghe Jiuyinlou. After the shop declared liquidation, they were paid 20% in cash, with over 90,000 yuan remaining. The plaintiffs then filed a civil lawsuit with the court. Later, a settlement was reached, with the defendant paying over 10,000 yuan in cash and five checks from the Banque Industrielle de Chine, and a Zhenjiang Zhongyudang deposit book was provided as collateral. However, the checks could not be cashed when they matured, and the Zhongyudang deposit book had also been cashed out by the defendant. Therefore, the plaintiffs reported the matter to the police, who are now prosecuting under Articles 339 and 356 of the Criminal Code for fraud and damaging creditor rights. However, according to a statement obtained by the police from the Banque Industrielle de Chine, the account only had ten yuan when the checks were issued. In the police station, the defendant stated that the settlement with the plaintiffs and the signing of the checks were entirely done by his son, Shao Xiaosong, and he knew nothing about it. Therefore, the police still need to summon Shao Xiaosong for questioning. It is requested that the case be adjourned again. Lawyer Xu Jiashi, representing Kuai Shaoqing, stated that he had never filed this lawsuit with the police, but the civil lawsuit part will still be filed. Shao Yueru claimed that after the liquidation of Yangqinghe Jiuyinlou, he went to Qingdao, and all matters relating to the shop were handled by his son. Therefore, he was completely unaware of how the settlement with the plaintiffs was handled. He only read the settlement agreement given to him by his son afterward, so he thought the matter was completely settled. He did not expect this incident to occur after so many years, which was completely unexpected. The Zhongyudang deposit book did not belong to him, and he did not know how it ended up in the hands of the plaintiffs. Lawyer Fan Gang then presented a copy of the settlement agreement, which stated that Shao Yueru was responsible for repaying over 20,000 yuan, of which over 10,000 yuan had already been paid, leaving over 10,000 yuan owed. Shao was not responsible for the rest. Therefore, this matter is only civil in nature. After reviewing the statements, Judge Dai ruled that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>Ma Xing's Murder of Her Husband Sentenced to Life Imprisonment Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhu Yongzhang Acquitted</p>
<p>Ma Xing (also known as Ma Wang), 26 years old, from Shandong, the wife of boatman Ma Shifa, worked with her husband in a boat at Yangjinggang Port. Zhu Yongzhang, 30 years old, also from Shandong and a boatman, was a relative of Ma and often visited, leading to an affair with Ma. Recently, Ma's aunt, Ma Lü, found out about the affair. Fearing exposure, Ma Xing rocked the boat to a garbage beach at the egg factory on the night of April 24th of this year while her husband was asleep. She rocked the boat to the Dinghai Bridge shore and threw Ma Shifa into the river, then falsely called for help, claiming that the boat had been hit by a large ship and her husband had climbed onto the ship. A police officer on duty at the Meifu Wharf heard the call for help and ordered Zhang Baoxiang, on a sampan docked at the wharf, to row the sampan to the middle of the river to rescue them. They then towed Ma Xing's boat to the garbage beach. At that time, Ma Xing's boat was only half-filled with water, and the mats were all gone. On April 26th, Ma Xing falsely reported the collision to the Jianghai Customs Water Police. On May 2nd, at approximately 9:00 AM, a Chinese policeman from the police station discovered a naked body on the Huangpu River beach at Chenjiazhui in Pudong, which had been bitten by dogs. Ma Xing identified the body as Ma Shifa's and pretended to cry. The case was reported to the District Court, and Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang brought back the coroner. The coroner determined that the body had been injured by animals after death, except for the face and right armpit to the right elbow. It was confirmed that he had drowned before death. Ma Xing's aunt, Ma Lü, filed a lawsuit against Ma Xing and her lover Zhu Yongzhang for conspiring to murder her husband because of the affair, and requested the Yangjing Police Station to arrest the adulterous couple and send them to the court. After further interrogation by Prosecutor Jiang, based on Ma Xing's claim that her husband had climbed onto a large ship, how could he have drowned? Furthermore, it was discovered that no large ship had entered the area that night, and the boat was only half-filled with water and had not sunk. How could the mats on the boat have fallen into the water? It was clear that it was a murder. When Ma Xing's boat was rescued, Zhu Yongzhang's boat was one of the four boats at the scene, along with Lü Dianchi, Zheng Jingyu, and Wang Jianlu. Everyone else heard the cries and looked over, but there was no sound from Zhu Yongzhang's boat. At the same time, Ma Xing claimed that she had seen Zhu Yongzhang, but Zhu claimed that he had not seen her. Therefore, he was prosecuted for being an accessory to the crime. Lawyer Wu presented evidence in defense, arguing that Zhu was not on the boat that night. After detailed investigation by the judge, the verdict was announced yesterday. Ma Xing was found guilty of murder, and Zhu Yongzhang was acquitted.</p>

<h3>American Woman Drives Car Too Fast, Runs Over and Kills Child</h3>
<p>Kind-Hearted Church Member; Judge Urges Generous Compensation</p>
<p>American woman, identified as Mrs. John Ayers (transliteration), worked at the Seventh-day Adventist Church at 50 Ningguo Road. At 2:40 PM on the 12th of this month, while driving her Buick car, license number 8363, eastward on Pingliang Road at high speed, she struck and knocked down a six-year-old Yangzhou boy, Li Tonghai (son of Li Hankui, a worker at the Da Zhonghua Trucking Company, residing at 42 Changjiang Street on that road), near house number 81. The boy suffered severe injuries. The American woman took the boy to the Tongren Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective. He died at 9:10 AM on the morning before yesterday. The hospital reported the incident, and the police ordered an investigation. The body was taken to the Philander Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, was dispatched to the morgue to examine the body. According to Mrs. John Ayers's testimony, the deceased crossed the road from north to south behind a truck coming from the opposite direction, so she could not see him, leading to the accident. According to Li Hanxiang, the uncle of the deceased, he witnessed the car driving too fast at the time of the accident. There was no truck passing by. The deceased's mother had already passed away, and his father worked hard to make a living. He requested justice. Prosecutor Zhang, upon hearing the testimonies, instructed the American woman, saying that since the child had been killed by her car, the police would investigate whether there was negligence. Since she worked at the church and was more charitable than others, she should provide generous compensation to the extremely poor family. The woman agreed and left. Prosecutor Zhang then ruled that the deceased boy, Li Tonghai, had been killed by a car before death. The body was handed over to his father, Li Hankui, to claim and bury after signing a bond.</p>
<h3>Ancient Coffin Discovered While Digging Trench</h3>
<p>Near the Kang Jili (street) on the left side of the Empire Theatre on Route Pichon in the French Concession, a coffin was discovered at a depth of over three feet while digging a trench for house renovation at approximately 2:00 PM yesterday. Due to its age, it was already rotten, buried approximately a hundred years ago. The owner reported the incident to the Tongren Fu Yuan Branch and requested that someone be sent to relocate the burial to the cemetery. After the instructions of the branch staff, they should first report to the responsible police station for investigation before notifying them to relocate the burial.</p>
<h3>Board of Directors Decides to Build Passenger Pier on the Bund</h3>
<p>Approved by the Board of Directors Yesterday</p>
<p>In March of this year, the Board of Directors decided to postpone the implementation of the plan to build a passenger pier on the Bund. Subsequently, the British Chamber of Commerce and other groups in this port opposed it. Therefore, the Board of Directors submitted the case to the Board's Works Committee for reconsideration. The Works Committee discussed the matter in detail at its last meeting. According to the report of the Director of Public Works, there are now three options for the committee to recommend to the Board of Directors: First, build a pier on the Bund for passengers and their friends, costing 200,000 yuan. Second, propose the previous Director of Public Works' plan to build a pier for passengers and baggage inspection. Third, maintain the original proposal and postpone implementation. After considering the options, the members believed that the Bureau had no obligation to provide baggage inspection facilities for the public. However, without a pier on the Bund, not only would it be inconvenient for passengers to embark and disembark, but it would also be detrimental to the view. Therefore, it was decided to recommend to the Board of Directors the new plan proposed by the Director of Public Works, i.e., the first option mentioned above. The Board of Directors approved the recommendation at its meeting yesterday (14th).</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Strictly Investigates Those Selling Goods Under False Pretenses</h3>

<h3>Polish Youth Detained, Reason Unknown</h3>
<p>Result: Detention Approved, Release Granted, Re-examination Postponed</p>
<p>A Polish youth, Jieqipai Futuo, 20 years old, an auditor residing in Room 509, YMCA, Xijingsi Road, was suddenly accused in the Nanshi District Court of defamation. The court issued an arrest warrant and entrusted it to the First Special Court for assistance. The Special Court then consulted the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched Sergeant Bao Tai yesterday morning to the YMCA to arrest Jie. He was immediately sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court, but the District Court did not send anyone to receive him. According to the defendant, Jieqipai Futuo, he does not know who accused him in the District Court, nor is he clear about the case. He only remembers that once, while enjoying a boat ride on the Huangpu River with his girlfriend and others, he had an argument with a boatman. Later, he heard that the River Police Station had refused to accept the case. He does not know if he is being accused for this matter. Police Station lawyer Wang Yaotang argued that since the District Court had no representative present today, the hearing should be postponed. Furthermore, given the defendant's young age and legitimate occupation, his passport could be confiscated, and he could be released, as there was no risk of him fleeing. Judge Huang ordered Jie's passport to be confiscated by the Police Station, and the case was rescheduled for re-examination at 10:00 AM on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Perpetrators of Acid Attack on Westerner's Eyes Separately Sentenced</h3>
<p>Western auditor Knox of the Yangshupu Road Shanghai Waterworks Company, due to strict management of workers, caused resentment. On December 28th of last year, at 9:50 PM, while Knox was walking near Oujia Road on Diswei Road, he was stopped by thugs who splashed nitric acid on his face and fled, causing severe injury and blindness to Knox's eyes. The case remained unsolved for half a year. Recently, detectives Yang Xinzheng and Yuan Xinzhong of the Jiashan Road Police Station and Detective Ji Xiucheng of the Yangshupu Police Station arrested seven suspects, including Tan Fusheng and Zhu Guozhi, in the Chinese Concession and handed them over to the First Special Court. After the interrogation, Judge Zhong Qing of the Third Criminal Division sentenced Tan Fusheng and Zhu Guozhi to eight years of imprisonment each. Zhu Derong, Shi Along, Zhao Zhilin, and Gao Jinlong were each sentenced to six years, and Pan Honggen to two years and six months, as a warning.</p>
<h3>Rice Store Clerk Falls into Huangpu River and Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Kang Hongsheng, 48 years old, a packing clerk at the Dumi industry's private wharf at the Sanqin Wharf in Nanshi, from Pudong, was packing rice on a rice boat in the Huangpu River at 10:00 AM yesterday. While walking on the gangplank, he accidentally lost his footing and fell into the river. Upon seeing this, boatmen rushed to rescue him, but due to the high tide, strong winds, and rapid current, coupled with the densely packed boats, he disappeared in an instant, joining the river's inhabitants. His whereabouts are still unknown, and his body has not been found. It is reported that the deceased had a large family, young and old, who all relied on him for their livelihood. Now, this sudden misfortune has befallen them. It is truly tragic.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Arises from Trademark Dispute Between Lao Xieda and Xiedaxiang</h3>
<p>Both Sides Competing for Business; Court Sets Date for Judgment After Yesterday's Hearing</p>
<p>Yong craftsman Fang Zhen, 44 years old, the manager of the Baodaxiang foreign goods and cotton cloth store on Xiaodongmen Street in the French Concession, recently filed a lawsuit, represented by a lawyer, in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, seeking confirmation of trademark rights due to a trademark dispute between Lao Xieda and Xiedaxiang foreign goods store on the same street. According to the lawsuit, the court, presided over by Judge Wu Ke, convened a hearing at 9:00 AM yesterday. Lawyers for both sides appeared in court. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff opened Lao Xieda last year and, according to commercial practice, submitted an application for registration to the Bureau of Social Affairs, which was then forwarded to the Ministry of Industry. However, it was rejected by the Bureau of Social Affairs due to a missing address. Subsequently, Xiedaxiang also added the character "Lao" (Old) to the Xiedaxiang sign and applied for registration, which was approved. Later, after the plaintiff corrected the procedures and applied for registration again, the Ministry of Industry did not approve it because Lao Xiedaxiang was registered earlier. Later, after the original applicant explained the situation, a decree was issued to file a lawsuit in court. Therefore, the plaintiff sought a court order to order the defendant to compensate for seven months of losses and confirm the plaintiff's right to use the trademark. The defendant's lawyer argued that the facts of the case were not as simple as the plaintiff described and that the evidence presented by the plaintiff today was one-sided. It was found that the plaintiff opened Lao Xieda, claiming it was an old shareholder, working together to expand the business. However, the plaintiff completely imitated the Xiedaxiang brand to compete. Xiedaxiang opened with twelve shareholders, and after the current plaintiffs, Ding Fangzhen and nine others, withdrew from the shareholders, they opened a Baodaxiang to the east and another Baodaxiang to the west near Xiedaxiang. However, because the business was not as prosperous as Xiedaxiang's, they imitated the Xiedaxiang brand and opened Lao Xieda, and published a statement in the newspaper, which the defendant refuted by publishing a reply in the newspaper. The plaintiff then submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry for registration. The Ministry of Industry believed that Lao Xieda was suspected of imitating Xiedaxiang Tongji and Lao Xiedaxiang and rejected the application. The evidence was also submitted to the court, requesting the court to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit and to order the plaintiff, as the defendant in the counterclaim, to stop using the Lao Xieda brand to avoid harming the defendant's commercial interests. The court, after reviewing the case, ordered the payment of outstanding litigation fees and declared the debate closed, setting the judgment for 8:00 AM on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Crane Hook Crushes Worker to Death</h3>
<p>Li Longhai, 34 years old, a merchant seaman and dockworker, was working in the No. 2 hold of the German ship Neumannke at Yangshupu Road at 3:40 PM the day before yesterday. Suddenly, a railway steel being hoisted by the crane hook came loose and fell, crushing Li's chest. He was rushed to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died at 3:00 AM yesterday. The hospital notified the Customs Water Police Station, which dispatched Detective Shen Changshan to take the body to the Lifesaving Bureau. The court verified the cause of death and ordered the body to be handed over to the family for burial.</p>
<h3>Elderly Maid Falls to Her Death After More Than Thirty Years of Service</h3>
<p>An elderly local woman, Zhu Ma (named Xiulin), 57 years old, had been a maid in the Liang family at No. 6, Sanyi Lane, Julai Road, for more than 30 years. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, she leaned a wooden ladder against the third-floor sun deck to retrieve firewood. Due to carelessness, she fell with the ladder to the back entrance of No. 323, Julai Road (because the front door of the house she lived in was in Sanyi Lane and the back door faced the road). The owner of the Zhang Yutai cigarette paper shop at No. 216 saw it and informed her master, who sent her to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road. Due to the severity of her injuries, she died before treatment could be administered. The hospital reported the death to the police station, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall for examination.</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>The Front Lines and the Rear</h3>
<p>— Shi Ji</p>
<p>In these critical times, anyone with a modicum of spirit cannot help but rise up. This is not limited to the bloody battles of the soldiers on the front lines or the civilians bandaging the wounds of the brave warriors. When news arrives in the rear that the soldiers on the front lines have reached the limit of their endurance and have risen up to resist, doesn't it also spontaneously gather considerable amounts of donations for their comfort? This moving and admirable spontaneous action demonstrates the nation's unified consciousness of resisting the enemy and guarantees that "the assessment of 'a heap of loose sand' has become a thing of the past." It also illustrates one of the most gratifying advancements among the Chinese people in recent years: united in common hatred against the enemy, every Chinese citizen, except for traitors, has abandoned their petty self-interests and placed the interests of the nation above all else. This gratifying phenomenon is rising with the salvational gunfire and expanding daily.</p>
<p>Moreover, with the enemy's forces deeply penetrating various parts of China, it is very difficult to distinguish between the front lines and the rear. Today's rear may be tomorrow's front lines. Therefore, while we are generously donating to the front lines in North China, we must also prepare to kill the enemy on the spot tomorrow! We cannot do without generous donations, and good men must prepare to offer even more precious things than property to the nation.</p>
<p>Therefore, the people in the rear today do not necessarily have to view going north to kill the enemy as the only opportunity to dedicate themselves to the nation. We have many opportunities to kill the enemy. Before the rear becomes the front lines, we have even more anti-enemy work to do! This does not mean letting the enemy defeat us one by one or resolve us piecemeal. On the contrary, we want to connect with the front lines to unleash even greater anti-enemy forces. Those of us in the rear today should, on the one hand, do as much as possible to help the front lines, and on the other hand, prepare for tomorrow's front lines, holding firm to our defenses. We must not let an inch of land be lost to the enemy!</p>
<p>There is much that we can and should do: donating money to the soldiers on the front lines is just one thing; in addition to material aid, we should also provide spiritual comfort, such as organizing comfort missions to the north, which is another thing. In the rear, in order to build a spiritual national defense and to awaken the united uprising of the backward masses, we should have other salvational work.</p>
<p>For example, initiating salvational singing and promoting the public performance of salvational dramas.</p>
<p>Regarding the singing of salvational songs, the folk education hall's singing team has already been mobilized. We do not yet know the details, but we do know that it welcomes the participation of various singing groups and music lovers. In this regard, I think we should provide 120,000 points of help to promote its realization, and this realization must be in the shortest possible time. In addition, it does not have to be limited to this one thing. The more, the better, as long as it is under the same salvational goal, and the size can vary at any time and place. Before there are sophisticated and great machine guns and cannons, even a purely rusty dagger should have the effect of killing the enemy! The form does not necessarily have to have any kind of meeting ceremony, as long as it can be promoted. Radio stations, streets, rural areas, and factories are all the best places to go, and it should not only be limited to singing oneself, but should immediately teach others, and the words and meanings of the songs should be explained clearly.</p>
<p>As for the public performance of salvational dramas, because there are restrictions on props, costumes, etc., it is naturally more difficult, but it should also be possible to do it. On the one hand, our playwrights should write more new and easy-to-stage scripts!</p>
<p>There is only one salvational goal, and there should be as many ways as possible, and it should not be limited to the front lines and the rear.</p>
<p>Naturally, this requires a prerequisite, that is, the government should immediately restore the people's movement, and anything that is salvational should be unconditionally allowed and helped to realize it!</p>
<h3>Lugou Bridge Can Be Our Graves</h3>
<p>— Ke Yu</p>
<p>My friends, spirited Chinese friends, the day before yesterday, when you opened the newspaper and saw the striking words "Japanese Army Shells Wanping," how indignant and alarmed were you! Afterwards, you thought that the two sides had reached a peaceful resolution and that the situation would not escalate, but with the Japanese intentionally seeking trouble and attempting to create a second "September 18th," this temporary delay was expected by friends concerned about national affairs. Once they had transferred reinforcements from the Kwantung Army, they attacked again!</p>
<p>Thus, you saw the alarming words "The Situation in North China Is Extremely Serious" in yesterday's Shen Bao. At this time, I think: your blood pressure must be rising, will you let them continue to act so recklessly? Spirited friends, I know you will shout: "We can't tolerate it anymore! The time has come for us to defend and resist!"</p>
<p>My friends, you will immediately recall the heroic words of the 29th Army when the Wanping Incident first occurred: "Lugou Bridge Can Be Our Graves!" The 29th Army, this army that defended the various passes of the Great Wall, for the sake of the liberation of the nation, for the sake of human peace and justice, the loyal and brave them will surely be able to continue their previous spirit of bloody battle and resist desperately! We also believe that the government has prepared for any eventuality, for the sake of our people.</p>
<p>However, preparation is preparation, whether the preparation will lead to action and resistance is something that neither you nor I can say. However, none of us wants to suffer the same tragic fate as Manchuria!</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>You have probably heard enough of the Northeastern compatriots' song of "Fight back to our homeland!" You have probably heard enough of the tragic news of the puppetization and poisoning of the Northeastern compatriots over the years. How do you feel about these things? Are you heartbroken? Are you indignant? Do you want revenge?</p>
<p>"Arise, you who refuse to be slaves, use our blood to defend our life's Lugou Bridge!" Every spirited Chinese friend should shout this, and shout it loudly.</p>
<p>Lugou Bridge is an important strategic point in North China's defense. To the southwest, the chimneys of the Changxindian factory stand tall. To the south is Fengtai, a large railway station where many railway lines converge. In the fields near this area, rich millet, corn, sorghum, peanuts, and cotton are planted. Camels carry bags of coal and baskets of red persimmons all day long, tied with copper bells, walking one step at a time. Below the bridge flows the Yongding River, which has been involved in many life-and-death relationships in the ancient Chinese nation's foreign wars. But I wonder if the current soldiers can shoulder the responsibility of defending our rivers and mountains!</p>
<p>In order to defend our territory, in order to safeguard our sovereignty, Lugou Bridge Can Be Our Graves!</p>
<h3>A School for Training Wild Birds to Fly</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>British law prohibits people from capturing and selling wild birds, but this does not apply to birds hatched in aviaries with rings on their legs. The ring is placed on the bird's leg a few days after it hatches, before it leaves the nest. Therefore, some bird sellers capture wild birds and put rings on their feet to evade the law. However, if the Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals finds out, they must be punished according to law, and the bird is confiscated and released by the government.</p>
<p>Wild birds that have been confined to small cages for a long time will lose their ability to fly because their wings have not been active for a long time. Once released, they will inevitably fall into the hands of hunters and will not be able to enjoy the joy of freedom. Therefore, benevolent people who love birds have planned to set up a school for training them to fly so that after they are released from their cages, they can practice flying high. When they can soar into the sky, they are allowed to re-enter the forests and fields. The first wild bird flying training school in England was founded by the Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Aihebai Township, Taimesididun Town. It was named the Animal Sanatorium. On the day of its official opening on June 15, the daughter of Sir Gaoheer, the president of the association, who was a female pilot, flew a plane in the sky around the school for a while, then landed and announced the opening. Hundreds of members attended the meeting to observe the first batch of "trainees."</p>
<p>In the open space of the school, a birdhouse was set up that was twelve feet high and wide. It housed twelve wild birds that were good at singing. There were several flower chickens, two goldfinches (the goldfinch is the most beautiful wild bird in England), a red-crowned finch, and a gray finch with a broken tail. Some bird sellers put small rings on the feet of some of these small birds to pretend that they were domestic birds for sale. The Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals proved that they were wild birds and reported them to the police station, which confiscated them.</p>
<p>This flying training school has been open for a month or two. Several birds have regained their health and strength after practicing in the school and have been given their freedom. A few yards from the school is a meadow and a row of trees, which is a very beautiful sanatorium for the birds that have been released from their cages. There is also a giant room with a concrete floor to prevent rats from hiding. Inside the room, there are flower and plant pots, a small tree in the middle, and a sloping ladder for them to jump on. As for food, bathtubs, water bowls, and bird nests, everything is available. Small birds with damaged wings can practice short flights inside, which is very comfortable. They are very intelligent. When they are strong enough to fly high and far, they will no longer bother their owners and will seek their own livelihood. A nightingale that has lived in the birdhouse for a long time is very tame and will fly and rest on anyone's finger. It was found in the snow in Gengxincun Garden last winter and was almost frozen to death. One of its legs was severely injured, and one of its eyes was blind. It has been recuperating in the school for six weeks and can now fly a little. It is hoped that one day it will be able to regain its freedom, otherwise it will have to spend the rest of its life in the school. Therefore, this school not only provides wild birds with flying training, but also a retirement home for disabled wild birds.</p>
<p>In a large room on the top floor, there is a crow that flew into someone's home. The owner saw that it was weak and pitiful and sent it to the school to recuperate. It is still very weak and cannot use its wings well. A few days ago, the school also took in an owl with severely injured eyes. Mr. Jierbai, who takes care of the birds all day, often washes its eyes patiently with medicinal water. He puts it in a basket during the day and lets her roam freely in a large room at night. There is also a small black bird with an injured beak, which Mr. Jierbai feeds by hand. Several pigeons have been recuperating in the school for a long time and are now able to take care of themselves and fly freely. They often fly out of the school to roam around.</p>
<p>In addition to a habitat for wild birds that sing well, the school also has two large birdhouses, which house a parrot, several canaries, and some foreign birds. It would be futile to set the foreign birds free, so they will remain in the school forever. The parrot was sent to the school by its former owner because he moved from a house with a garden to the upper floors of a tall building and did not want it to lose its freedom in the garden so that it could be comfortable. Some of the foreign birds were also sent by their owners so that they could enjoy possible freedom. Some were abandoned in an empty house and almost starved to death. They were found by the police and sent to the school to give them a chance to live.</p>
<p>The flying training school was first initiated by Ms. Bailandixu of Qisiweike Town because she had seen a bird lover build a birdhouse near the New Church Town in Switzerland to help birds that had just been released from cages. Shortly after Ms. Bailandixu initiated it, the Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Aihebai Township, Taimesididun Town, implemented the establishment of this flying training school. It is expected that it will be promoted throughout the country in the future, which is truly good news for wild birds. Alas! People pay so much attention to the freedom of wild birds, but they turn a blind eye to the loss of freedom of oppressed and small nations, and no one helps them. This can be considered "seeing an autumn hair but not seeing a cartload of firewood."</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Now we no longer hope that "justice" will "lend a hand." There is no "justice" in this world! We must rouse our wings and fly freely in the sky! Listen, the sound of cannons in North China has sounded. This is the time for us to fly freely!</p>
<h3>Not Exactly a Poem</h3>
<p>— Jie Ren</p>
<p>After the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, reading the urgent telegram on page two of this newspaper on the morning of the second, it said, "More than thirty Japanese officers were injured, many of whom had their arms cut off by the 29th Army's broadsword team." Thinking of the broadsword, I am moved to write this.</p>
<p>Big Broadsword,</p>
<p>In those years, you shone brightly at Xifengkou,</p>
<p>Making the enemy terrified!</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>The time has come again,</p>
<p>Survival is at stake!</p>
<p>Only by uniting against foreign forces,</p>
<p>Can we save the nation and survive!</p>
<p>The oppressed,</p>
<p>Only by everyone rising up to resist!</p>
<p>The oppressed,</p>
<p>Without machine guns, even a broadsword will do.</p>
<p>Broadsword,</p>
<p>Revive your divine power,</p>
<p>Fight for national liberation!</p>
<p>Walk towards the road to freedom!</p>
<h3>To the Front Lines!</h3>
<p>Dear Reporter:</p>
<p>The prelude to the national war has begun. In order to demand national equality and national independence, we must fight.</p>
<p>The loyal and brave soldiers on the front lines have begun the work of resisting the enemy. Of course, under the fierce artillery fire, death is an unavoidable fact. But can we fear death? Can we cling to life? Such a death is not the most valuable death in our ideals!</p>
<p>Sir, I am excited. My heart is agitated. I want to go to the front lines to fulfill some of my national responsibilities. Although I know it is very dangerous and difficult, I cannot take that into consideration in order to fulfill some of the national obligations that I should have.</p>
<p>In order to go to the front lines easily, here, I sincerely request you to tell me what groups in Shanghai (or nearby) want to go to the front lines to work. Also, the office or address of Mr. Li Guang'an, director of the 29th Army's Shanghai Office, because I know that if there is no group and I go alone, it is very dangerous to act there, or there is nowhere to go, wouldn't it be a dead end? If I can see Mr. Li, then I can ask him to introduce me and give me a way in.</p>
<p>Sir, please take the time to reply to this person who wants to go to the front lines. Sincerely, Hu Zhiyong</p>
<p>Mr. Zhiyong:</p>
<p>Reading this letter excites me very much! "To demand national equality and national independence," we should stand up and participate in the "work of resisting the enemy." "Going to the front lines" is even an "obligation that every citizen should fulfill." However, as Mr. Sir is worried, there are many inconveniences in individual actions. However, the work of saving the country is multifaceted. Today, Mr. Shi Ji's "Talks" talks about this issue. Therefore, at present, I think it is advisable for Mr. to actively do some work nearby. Editor Sincerely Reply</p>
<h3>The Whip</h3>
<p>— Yi Qin</p>
<p>The bleak sunlight shines upon the vast wilderness. The wilderness is a large cradle, and also an ancient tomb. The wilderness is always shrouded in melancholy.</p>
<p>The autumn wind, silently blows across the withered plains, like a lament, and also like a moan.</p>
<p>The ox is a benevolent animal. In the desolate fields, every year it exhausts its strength, dragging the mountain-heavy iron plow, plowing endless happiness for people.</p>
<p>We should thank this benevolent animal!</p>
<p>Cruel people have hearts like snakes and scorpions. When the benevolent animal has plowed too many fields and stops to rest for a moment, the long whip is pulled down from the shoulder.</p>
<p>The benevolent animal cannot bear this severe pain, and lets out a howl like a wolf, and then drags the ten-thousand-jin weight forward again.</p>
<p>When it has exhausted its strength and pauses for a rest again, another lash of the whip falls on its body.</p>
<p>Ox, benevolent and loyal animal! Is it for the sake of people's happiness that you endure this unbearable whipping?</p>
<p>——I am also a whipped animal! Driven by the compulsion of life, I have been drifting in this unfamiliar foreign land since I was young. I have seen enough cruel faces, and endured all the mockery of people! I feel terrified!</p>
<p>In the twilight, I wander in this desolate field. Years of hunger have forced upon me a heavy illness. A choking cough reverberates throughout the universe, and a mouthful of thick phlegm falls on the barren ground. ——In the phlegm, I unexpectedly discovered scarlet blood streaks.</p>
<p>Fate is just like a frivolous illusion. Lonely, ethereal.</p>
<p>The long journey has made me feel the fatigue of the long road. I silently rest again in the ancient temple in the mountains and fields.</p>
<p>——Also a whipped animal!</p>
<p>I thought like this.</p>
