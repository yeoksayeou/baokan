<h3>日本新外相發表對華外交宣言</h3>
<p>平等原則協調精神　努力打開中日僵局</p>
<p>［東京］今晨貴族院開會時、議員大河內子爵提出關於外交問題之質族院開會時、議員大河內子爵提出關於外交問題之質問、由外相佐藤致答、歷時三十五分、此為外相就任以來、關於外交政策之初次正式宣言、各方面均予重視、佐藤雖對內政缺乏充分經騐、但因受長期現身於國際舞臺上活動之磨鍊、故其思想與態度、頗留良好印象、由於詞畢時受會塲之熱烈鼓掌歡迎、可見一斑、佐藤之答詞謂、一個國家之外交、應有其連續性、但事態常有變動、故前閣所採行之方策、有充分加以檢討之必要、自不待言、一切與現局不適宜者、應設法予以改變、此為最重要之點、佐藤繼謂在外交上不應忘却對方、此語表面雖屬普通、但實際上甚有意義、又謂、當國內輿情極端激動、我國內受强烈意見所支配時、此種忘却對方之缺點可以發生、卽一般以為勿論我儕要求者為何事、出於何種方式、遠到何種程度、苟能以强硬態度提出之、必可如願以償、但對方亦有其輿論、常有不能接受我濟之要求者、此點為一般所完全忽略、職是之故、外交上暫時之停滯、乃不可避免者也、此語頗有嚴厲警告之作用、</p>
<p>關於日英之外交、佐藤謂、據本人所知、滿洲事件發生後、英國以為日本之行動、僅限於長城之北、但厥後日本越過長城、而侵入華北、進行種種活動時、英國因而極感憂慮、恐日本行為如不加注意、可能侵害英國在華北華中甚至華南之權益、至於華北問題、日本態度已由首相明白闡明、本人深信倘吾儕尊重對方利益、而求在華和平之發展、對他人不加敵視、則吾儕自可獲得其他各國之諒解、此為眞正保障日本利益之方法也、佐藤此言、為以前由焦土外交以至協和外交時代各外相所不敢言、</p>
<p>佐藤旋論及對華外交謂、中日談判已陷僵局、乃不可否認之事實、但余對談判已失敗之說、不能毫無懷疑而予以贊同、目前情形只可視為引起最大困難之不幸的一霎時間、但應採取何種方策以打開僵局、誠極大之問題、尤以滿洲事件發生後、許多困難事件之糾紛、已達極點、苟余能不諱言、目前中日問題只有吾儕改變方法、另從新起點着手、方可解决、完全獨立國家間之交涉、應以平等地位為根據、此乃國際關係通常途徑而無可驚異者也、惟此自然之原則常被遺忘、在某種事件上、尤其是國民與國民間之關係吾儕常遲疑採取對等地位而以優越地位自居、此種優越觀念在國際關係上常引起極大障碍、佐藤提出抽象的根本原則以警告國人後、則進入具體之論題而發問曰、在中日談判以及兩國人民間之事件、吾人至今曾以平等地位予以進行乎、此項問題全留待諸君自行裁答、但余以為過去一切應付諸東流、而從新以平等地位進行談判、此並非對中國之要求特別讓步、亦非予以特殊之應付、中國常責日本不給予平等關係、而要求一切談判應以平等地位為根據等等、苟中國對此點不予滿意、余相信中日談判順利準行上、將常有障碍之存在、關於此層、余以為對等成不對等觀念、應予放棄、成代以促膝談心之態度、充分考慮中國之要求以及與中國有密切關係之權利、同時與日本有密切關係之利益、亦應誠摯予以解釋、吾人願在不犧性與日有密切關係之利益、以及恢復以平等地位為根據的談判之範圍內、保持協調之精神、雖不知中國對此如何反應、但彼邦茍有决心、日本毫無疑問必予以各種便利、甚至改變已往談判之內容云云、</p>
<p>佐藤上述關於對華外交之宣言、自幣原以後、實際上卽末曾聞及、而在目前情况下、頗似空谷足音、雖於實施時、佐藤能否依照如此根本之信念應付具體問題、而克服日本國內之困難、仍屬疑問、但僅就佐藤對華基本途徑而論、已確較廣田與有田為進步、聞陸軍方面深恐佐藤之演說、或將使中國採取强硬態度、而對中國可能之反響表示深切關懷云、（八日中央社電）</p>

<p>㊀實行此項預算、則有急招物價昂貴而破壞民生安定之虞、㊁國民負担為之驟增、故對於國民生活、務須不使之發生急激衝動、實為最要、㊂鉅額軍費之消化及以之備辦原料、應努力避免惡劣影響由谷義沼（東方會）起稱</p>
<p>林內閣將廣義國防備極曲解、竟壓至急角度之狹義國防矣、夫國防之要諦、當在軍備與國民生活之綜合擴大、而林內閣之政策對於此處並未顧及、繼謂對於修正預算根本不能贊成、至於物價之調節等件、主張應依照東方會之再建國家經濟說、又謂地方交付金不足三千萬元殊屬不合、最後痛詆政治交易之惡弊、認為係議會政治之勁敵、非軍部諸君所採取之陋劣政治手段卽是也云云、</p>
<p>大口喜六登台、朗讀附帶决議後、敷衍其趣旨、表示贊成論調、其次由民政黨之中村三之丞氏述及贊成之意見、謂不應陶醉於各人之理論、作不負責任之言行以反對預算等語、</p>
<p>豐田收氏（昭和）請政府注意因國防費之增大、切勿惹起跛行景氣後、亦表示贊成、</p>
<p>椎尾弁匡氏列舉政府之政綱五項以上、謂缺乏實現之意圖、吾人雖贊成本屆預算、但未必信任政府、故仍望政府注意今後之措置、</p>
<p>野中徹也（國同）朗讀國民同盟之希望條件後、亦表贊成、</p>
<p>至此討論完畢、舉行表决、贊成者起立、除社大及東方會以外、全體議員起立、一致贊成、於是總計廿八億一千餘萬圓之大預算案、以大多數可决矣、午後七時許散會、（八日同盟電）</p>

<p>主席報告</p>
<p>行禮如儀後、由主席林克聰報告、略謂、自一九零九年、美國婦女、在三月八日要求解放運動以來、接着各國的婦女、都漸漸開始解放、就中國來講、中國的婦女從這高潮傳到東亞以後、對於本身所遭受的種種壓迫與痛苦、亦都有了覺悟、在民國十五年國民革命軍誓師以來、政府亦能順應婦女的要求、先後制定許多關於提高婦女地位的法律、雖然現在大多數的婦女、仍舊困頓於封建宗法勢力與生產落後生活無保障的束縛與壓迫之下、但是在政治和法律各方面看來、不能不說已有相當的收穫、所以我們今後的婦女運動、應該多做些積極的實際的工作、尤其在國難嚴重的現在、我們女同胞、都應該努力奮起、在政府領導之下、做禦侮救亡工作、我相信中國的婦女問題、非要等到整個的中國得到自由平等的時候、是不能完全解决的、希望大家一致團結、共同努力云云、</p>
<p>演詞彙誌</p>

<h3>談頑癬</h3>
<p>癬而曰頑。其治療之難可知。原因於白癬菌及其類似之菌傳染而起。生於皮膚易濕潤之部。如大腿內側。陰囊等。由此蔓延至會陰。臀部。或自陰阜至腹塞而達臍窩。他如乳部。腋窩。頹項。亦有發之者。初起為錢大之紅色斑。稍有落屑。漸達十文乃二十文銅幣大。中央稍退色凹陷。周圍之輪廓甚明瞭。隆起為堤狀。且處處溫有小水泡。至後遺留枯燥痂皮。如是漸向周圍增大。常作劇烈之騷癢。妨害安眠。易致神經衰弱。茍非用具有深達組織作用之殺菌止癢劑。不易治愈也。此種頑癬惡瘡。以前醫家在臨症上頗多視為棘手者。今乃得一迅速解决之方法。蓋卽為用“甘露”藥水之塗搽。歷經使用結果。認為在皮膚病與癬瘡藥中。最優良有效之劑。“甘露”成份旣佳。質又純潔。而且使用簡便。如患者發生癬瘡等症。或已生而未愈者。宜卽用“甘露”治之。可速愈。且能不復發。本劑為上海同仁西藥社著名出品。各埠藥房均有代售。患者可就近購試也。</p>

<h3>紗花　本月紗殊虛弱</h3>
<p>多頭上月收進之貨　大都已在本月套出</p>
<p>紗市晨跌午回、趨勢尚屬平靜、惟大都心理看跌、因紗廠錠子開齊、目日廠添裝新機器甚多、預料將後生產必增、供求兩方、當可相衡、所以投機尚拋賣心思奇濃、昔日市傳印商派把持、一般附和者業已轉舵、將現貨籌碼套在三月期、變而為大量交貨矣、因此世界棉業雖欣欣向榮、而上海市塲影響甚微、標紗陣勢漸來近低遠高之象矣、</p>
<p>二盤以後急轉直下</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月一律上騰、因一品美棉紗花市况步步飛漲人心活躍、各月均漲五角至一元、詎料二盤開拍、賣氣頓濃、氣勢急轉直下、市塲多說、某某多額、在近月山多翻空故三品現紗雖漲九元至十元、市塲仍難振作、標紗結果、本月比上日收盤價跌一元一角、遠跌一•四•六角、午後開盤、市氣甚弱、以一般跟印商之多頭在二月期多數翻空、將上月收進之貨、套出交解、人氣虛弱、再跌七角、惟遠月勿動、二盤後稍稍回好、迨至收盤、天津帮購倉庫中紗數百包、售價照市廉宜三元至三元半、空頭略扒而堅、結果各月比上午收盤價回上四•五•七•八角、查賣出裕大三千六百包、錦昌一千八百包、明德一千四百五十包、恒德八百五十包、元一一千四百包、大昌成一千四百包、泰昌一千三百包、同和一千一百包、潤康九百包、買進長豐一千三百包、德大一千三百包、大豐一千七百包、振大一千六百包、望泰興一千五百五十包、協成二千九百包、大昶二千八百五十包、泰昌八百五十包、昶記七百包一日間、最高低及收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>期棉形勢平庸</h3>
<p>棉市復平、海外印美棉市漲勢雖覺劇烈、然本埠人氣平庸良以存棉充足各廠儲藏豐富、據市塲言、內地尚有數成未曾運出故外棉日日上騰、本棉漲力未熾云</p>
<p>外棉上漲無甚影響</p>
<p>標花開盤各月微升五分至一角拍至遠月勿動、二盤開拍、隨紗市下挫、人氣鬆懈、但美棉續漲印棉漲風更熾、大阪三品花亦漲一•二元不等、然本埠人心平平、標花結果各月比上日收盤價均跌五分午後開盤、市情轉趨平淡、有一部因美棉連漲多日、預料或有反動、買氣稍平、結果各月比上午收盤價漲跌五分至一角半、查賣出源興昌三千担、錦昌二千七百担、大孚五千担、通記三千一百担、明德二千四百担、昶記一千七百担、愼昌一千五百担、長餘一千八百担、仁豐二千二百担、元一四千五百担、長豐三千担、潤康五千七百擔、永大一千八百担益康五千八百担、買進大豐二千八百担、恒益七千一百擔、瑞大二千九百担森康四千八百擔、泰昌六千擔、大昶五千四百擔、信誠五千二百擔、長和九千二百擔、愼記二千一百擔、一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>
<p>現棉廠需尚覺暢達</p>
<p>現棉消費尚稱不惡、廠胃仍爽來源未見、</p>
<h3>三品紗花繼續上升</h3>

<h3>上週優級印棉非常活動</h3>
<p>上週因美棉上升、空戶不安、市况有力、優級棉非常活動、低級棉乏人注意、蘭開夏及大陸商有相當買進、日本依然絕跡市塲、惟有舊額、據報在等候裝運日本、印度紗廠較前活動、遠東方面、發展希望、頗堪注意、蓋就目前堅勢而論、日本在短期間、或有重入市塲之希望也、附録上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>
<h3>疋頭　春令貨銷路起色</h3>
<p>現貨均已操在同業手中　怡和承接南洋大批定貨</p>
<p>昨棉布市面、受海外棉市繼續暴騰之激盪、廠家心思大堅、天時晴正和暖、春令淺色貨布疋銷路漸有起色、各地零躉添貨、頗為繁忙、惟巨額進胃、尚付缺如、布價變動甚微、以東疋細布細斜•八四原布•為最堅、八四原布再漲、每疋一角細斜細布漲二分半、陽鶴牌細布細斜、以現貨軋缺、激漲五分至七分半、廠方近期貨額垂盡、昨日信伊籐等行開出龍頭花鳥陽鶴等牌、細布細斜五六月份期貨近千件、廠盤近堅遠鬆、近期貨額子、均在同業大戶手中、故現貨生意雖未大旺、售價甚堅成交以本街色布業染坯需胃較濃、青鳥天津帮買進青島貨雙飛龍細布二百餘件、以靑島布市堅挺之故、花色貨走銷、以條子色素府綢為最佳、川粵湘均有躉額催裝其他亦均有動辦、色布如藍布士林布色斜、客帮走勢仍滯、惟內地帮零拆尚佳、本廠貨粗布重磅走勢最佳、怡和廠因承接海外南洋一帶巨額定貨、因之本埠逐日派出大减、現貨𠰛缺、細布細斜價見平定、粵滇長江及本埠染坯去路平席惟各廠出數已逐步、减少、</p>
<h3>糧食　油豆餅又飛漲</h3>

<p>昨標凖油豆餅、晨間開市、卽被大連報漲所激起、且現貨本客去胃均活、業內外人心一致向上業外新多與補空兩貪、而行號初則堅持不出、繼聞連訊回平、隨有吐出、惟外行進取仍濃、市價互見升降、最後標油較漲四角半至二角半、標豆漲三四分、標餅近月亦漲一分半、遠期則升降不一云、</p>
<p>查昨日豆餅市之漲風、盛於一切、一得大連行市騰躍之助、二因到存有兩乏之虞、所以造成猛烈之漲風、結果花生油及豆油均漲七角、豆餅漲三分、黃豆更覺俏俐、主因大連劇升、劃本不符、來源必絕、且車豆因車輛不敷、亦已减少、故一般貨戶看脚地非常穩固、在售價上一致扳足、所以行情在暢銷之下、比上週六猛提一角、共計做開各豆一萬三千餘包、前途趨勢仍看有進無退、洋莊芝蔴、在油價頻漲之中、市况轉呈活絡、上週六聞有日商回出六百噸、價先開十四元三角半、後卽升至十四元四角云、</p>
<h3>粉價全日步步低</h3>

<p>昨日粉市、各月份市面、呈初穩繼跌之象、以洋麥報價、上落甚微、祇四八分之相互出入、當開價後、因一部分人心尚佳、故開價與前週收盤、大致相仿、新粉市面、反見好一分、惟至二盤、逐見鬆軟、因天時已佳、實銷仍沉寂不前、業外多頭、遂有出檔、故各月份卽落一分外、迨至下午開盤、賣氣驟暢、交易亦盛、以散戶多頭、鑒於實銷觀望、勢難再擯、回脫一旺、市遂急瀉、較之上午之最高價、計落三五分不等、此種情形、寬以市值過高、走銷不免清淡、所以仍看盤旋之勢云、</p>
<h3>天氣放晴麥市受影響</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、亦呈先漲後跌之態、因洋麥報價、互有上落、故業外人心、依然堅定、三四月份反遠期新麥曾提漲三五分、一至收盤、因期粉不振、人心又忽向下、較初盤回落二三分、迨至下午開盤市氣一致鬆落、因粉銷不旺、天時又亦晴暢、故多頭趁勢脫手、市價三五八分不等、據業中之傳說、江北一帶之存麥、尚有二三成之譜、設源源裝中、新麥以前、實無處缺貨也、現麥市而仍見平穩、開高紹興麥六元六角、通州麥六元五角一分、計見　二千餘包云、</p>

<h3>證券　公債升降絕微</h3>
<p>昨日華商證券交易所、公債市塲、仍趨於極端沉悶狀態中、大戶交易、寥寥無幾、散戶賣買、均急於掉期、因而市價升降極微、趨勢則尚稱昂挺、惟因時局穩定及多空相持、債市續多盤旋之狀也、全日經過、上午開盤為市氣堅昂散戶頗多買進、十•七十七號等亦收買不少、五•叫十三號則在賣出、市價致略升五分至一角半、次盤檯面愈形清寂以上號稍有收買、散戶進出極為昆屯戊丙等好上五分、乙種下月回小五分、下午市况、趨勢益呆、開盤均屬散戶掉期交易、市價亦升降麖定僅五分參差、收盤因十六•七十一號等略起拋賣戊丙等疲跌角許惟人氣仍趨呆滯、全日結果統一債俱祇五分、角之漲跌成交總數計二百六十萬元茲將其漲跌高低比較、列表如左、（單位元成交單位百元、）</p>

<p>合組公司昨為本週第一次標兌粵糖之期、以洋糖轉升成交稍增當售出順德廠五羊粗白二千百十一包二十二元六角、又東莞廠粗白四百三十包同價、惠州中砂白原價、未成交、</p>
<h3>南北貨　蜜棗上檔缺貨轉緊</h3>
<p>蜜棗近市中檔如禿禿、因陸續有到、有看鬆之勢、惟上檔以貨缺反緊、如特別莊現售六十元、大面四十六七元、較高之禿禿四十四元、後防跌、下檔貢面四十元至三十八元、</p>
<h3>南寗茴香銷路轉淡</h3>
<p>茴香入春以來、南寗貨曾達四十元、但近因銷路轉淡、又值某號開出次貨一批、稍有微露、價僅二十七元半、不免受其影響、故聞價回小元許、現市南寗貨三十九元、北海貨三十八元、尚有看軟之象、</p>

<h3>五金　會司鐵存底淺薄</h3>
<p>二百磅美會司鐵新近交易十分活潑客帮廠家均有採辦、而囤戶方面、亦因其價低廉、頗多吸收、是以市情甚堅、標凖扶搖直上、每箱沽四十二元（老鋼廠）及四十元○七角半（新鋼廠）一種、但因存底淺薄、價格已比前好起多多、據最近海外定價之上升、兼之到源單薄、故後市情况殊甚良秀、</p>
<h3>六尺白鐵漲風復盛</h3>
<p>六尺東白鐵、因囤戶現貨出籠、致市象回軟至一元一角七八分、最近海外黑鐵皮及自鉛（均係製白鐵皮之原料）等定價紛紛上升、故其市勢復見良佳、而行情因人心之膨脹、故亦漲風復起、查昨開出五千五六百張、其價為一元二角至一元二角二三分不等、聞四川帮昨市進意甚濃、所以來市開價防要再涨也云、</p>

<p>㊀互稱</p>
<p>公司必有一定之名稱，故本表首列名稱。又公司有無限公司，兩合公司，股份有限公司，及股份兩合公司之別，故名稱中應同時填明公司之種類。公司之種類，實卽公司名稱之一部份也。其所填報者，應與公司登記所領之執照中所填者相同。本表名稱地位，本印有股份字樣，如屬無限公司及兩合公司，應將此二字抹去，此於填造時當加以注意。</p>

<h3>夢想</h3>
<p>— （嚴懋德）</p>
<p>馬爾騰曾說：“現在的一切，不過是過去各時代的夢想者的總和——過去各時代的夢想的實現的結果使人生有價值，把人類從卑賤中釋放出來，把人類從凡庸醜惡中舉㧞出來——我們都得感謝我們的夢想者。”</p>
<p>所以夢想並不是壤事，蓋在夢想中，能獲得新鮮的生命，能引導成功的大道，電學家愛迭生，曾夢想從雜草中提煉出可以用來製造橡皮的乳狀體，便從夢想着手實騐，費二年之久，居然給他發現出來。</p>
<p>但徒有夢想，而沒有實際的夢想，徒耗精神，無裨實際，蓋有了夢想，同時須有實現夢想堅毅的意志與决心，不但要盡量發展夢想，而隨在夢想的後面，就是要做，徒有願望，而不能拿出力量去做，來實現夢想，這足以敗事，故要有實際的夢想，夢想而附以堅苦的工作，不斷的努力，纔有用處。</p>
<p>夢想雖是刺激品，但也是毒藥，它可使人發痴，也可使人成功，讓夢想做我們的奴隸，不讓它做我們的主人。</p>
<h3>事變後的吉林城</h3>
<p>— 吳江</p>
<p>要是從前你在吉林住過的話，在五年後的今日，又舊地重遊地去巡禮一回，那兒改觀得會使你咋舌呢。</p>
<p>一踏上新開門外那條馬路，所觸目到的是一排排另具一種風格的平矮房屋，門面裝飾和窗櫥裏一切陳設方式，也逈然不同。這條馬路呌做商埠地，×國領事館就建在這兒，所以環在領館的周遭，都建成清一色的住宅和商店，形成異樣的風光。這不免使你感到好像置身在從未曾到過的境地那般陌生，那樣驚奇。</p>
<p>走進城裏那商業中心的河南街，兩傍木築成的人行道已拆毀掉，街道雖較前展寬了，但市面却冪上一層極蕭條的氣雰。踱入那冠絕全城的和興隆百貨公司，只見店員多於顧客，冷寂寂的，那種門庭若市的黃金時代已成過去。但正相反的却是那些什麼醉仙閣，雲中仙館……等，如雨後春筍般設立在街頭巷尾，每到黃昏時候，門前車水馬龍，眞個熱鬧異常據說：那些“醉仙”每年在冰天雪地中要凍死成百，這“百”字何等驚人呵！</p>
<p>在沿江的東大灘（街名）上，已看不見幾個山東，河北等省的人了。事變前，這條街是他們聚居的大本營，每年許多從關內來找生活的，都寄居在這兒，所以這兒成為他們創家立業的發祥地。但，這幾年來他們處在王道的？光輝下，反不能生活過去，都先先後後如喪家之犬般逃回關內去。於今這兒是給另一種人“鵲巢鳩佔”了。——街景怪寥落的。</p>
<p>東關和沿江街一帶那些富有者住宅的大門，都是深深地嚴扃着的，院落裏靜寂得像無人居住般，任你怎麼敲呀敲的，也不輕易給你開的，這是怎麼回事呢？據說是怕那些浪人或朝鮮人不時光顧呀。他們踏進大門來，就把所携帶的東西：如什麼信紙信封，或毛巾，香皂之類向你兜售。不接受吧未免孤負了他們上門來的盛意；接受吧却要給以十倍廿倍的高價，才能填塞他們的慾壑呢。還有的一進門來，就向你一壁訴說他年來流落在東北，遭受種種不幸，現要回國去，缺乏川資等話：一壁掏出什麼手表或戒指之類的玩意，情致殷殷地求你留下。那末，你若知趣的話，就爽爽快快贈他一筆像樣的錢，並把原物退還，那才能免掉一切無謂的糾纏；這，不是呌作“文明的掠奪”嗎？</p>

<h3>丙子除夕</h3>
<p>— （天虛我生）</p>
<p>除夕忽還家，兒童起譁噪，一犬與三雛，爭向膝邊繞，衆口發同聲，都道好好好，兩手不及持，兩肘不及抱，山妻下樓迎，未語先展笑，怎說不歸來，畢竟歸來了，旣是要歸來，胡不歸來早，我道不期然，反而覺高妙，不速之客來，何必先通報，我本在故鄉，準備做東道，邀聚客中人，鷄黍同醉飽，回念我家中，總覺一個少，同乘快車來，譬如睡中覺，光陰不能買，何苦竟處耗，離合與悲歡，莫不由心造，過去不必問，未來不可料，人生如泡影，萬緣皆碰巧，今夜不須眠，團坐直到曉，猶恐在夢中，耳畔聽雞呌。</p>

<p>但是到了這個時候，天空的風景，越是值得玩賞，所以他還靠了窗戶檻兒向外張望着，不肯走開。後來小菊兩手捧了煤油燈上來，放下了燈，也擠到窗檻邊來站着，笑問道：小姐看什麼東西，看到這樣的有趣，我也看一看罷。夢蘭見他兩手扶了窗檻，身子只向上撐，笑道：你留什麼，這樣出力。小菊道：小姐看什麼，我也看什麼。夢蘭將他推開把窗戶立刻關起來笑道：你發什麼傻？小菊退後兩步，靠了房門，向他望着道：是我發傻嗎？因為小姐擠着向前看，我才跟着向前看的。夢蘭笑道：我是有瘋病，你也跟着我害疯病嗎？小菊懂可的將頭一伸對了夢蘭臉上注意着。因問道：為什麼小姐總是這樣發痴發呆的樣子。夢蘭道：你要問這一個道理嗎？你……你不會懂的。可是你不猛，就是你的福氣。小菊望了他道：小姐這話，什麼意思？夢蘭道：告訴你什麼意思，你還不是懂了嗎？你懂了就沒有福氣了。你還願意沒有福氣嗎？不要在這裏發痴了，一塊兒下樓去罷。小菊向夢蘭看看，低頭笑着，下樓去了。夢蘭把燈芯扭大些，拿了一本書攤在桌上，正待坐下來看。小菊却在樓底下大聲叫道：小姐快下樓吃飯罷，大家全等着你呢。太太吩咐我來叫的。夢蘭這就對了壁上懸的鏡子，裝出一種迎人微笑的樣子來。作一次笑，還怕是不怎樣的自然，對鏡子連照了四五回，這就自言自語的道：大概可以了。自己摸摸頭髪，牽牽衣襟，然後向前進堂屋裏吃晚飯去。當自己坐在桌上的時候，總怕自己的態度，不十分自然，因之故意的向母親嫂嫂說笑着，現出一分高興來。江太太在吃这顿饭的时候，果然是有異於平常，老是將兩隻眼睛，在他週身上下打量。夢蘭笑着把飯吃過去了，還不立刻上樓，又在母親屋子裏洗臉喝茶很是談了一會子，方才回到樓上去。在吃飯的時候，二少奶最是放心不過，除了老把眼睛向他看着而外，而且還隨了他的話音，找話談說。直待他上樓以後，方才把心事安定了，但是夢蘭的心事，果眞的安定了嗎？這是在家裏如此，到了次日早上，自己上學的時候，那兩道眉毛，可又重新皺到一處來了。他是全家起來最早的一個人。他皺了眉毛，只有跟着起來伺候茶水的小菊，是看到他的顏色的。（一四二）</p>

<h3>世界四大巨頭的軼事（上）</h3>
<p>— 晁溪</p>
<p>一，穿長靴睡覺的史丹林</p>
<p>在蘇聯，現在最得勢的史丹林，這位獨裁者，是以穿長靴睡覺有名於世，他那硬硬的睡床，就設在他那桃花心木製的公事檯的側旁，據好事者的考證，這公事檯就是從前帝政時代有名於世的酷虐內相托列樸夫在那邊打官話的桌子。</p>
<p>那以史丹林為極危險的革命黨員，而處以終身遠留於西伯利亞鹽坑的，就是這內相托列樸夫，原來這種流刑的人們，普通是沒有再返故鄉的可能的，可是命運的滑稽，不惟史丹林終而重又回來，而且已變為曾經放置過支配自己的那隻桃花心木公事檯的主人翁，現在史丹林每月署名發佈其雷厲風行的書類，就在這因緣不淺的桌上。</p>
<p>這共黨的柱石史丹林的服裝，是簡單之至，確不愧為工農國的王者，粗劣的襯衫，黑天鵝絨的洋褲，而終於長靴，那結了領帶又穿了外套的服裝，是再講究沒有的了，在他的服裝中，可以呌做裝飾的就是那紅紅的領帶和那底服的領緣。</p>
<p>史丹林是始終不露微笑的人物，可是比這還有更妙的事，就是他所說的話呌人家非常難聽，不論是誰，如果沒有在他的家鄉高加索住過，一定不容易了解他的說話，他所說的話是一種斯拉夫系猶太人所說的混淆語，沒有什麼文法的，當他流逐到西伯利亞的時候，那些同樣的多數政治犯猶太人，每日影響着他的言語。</p>
<p>這在俄國握了絕對權力的史丹林，他要怎樣豪奢的生活都是可能的，可是他日常所吃的東西，只有洋葱未混雞蛋（用雞醬汁調味)和黑麺包這種粗劣的食物，且他還疑懼廚子要毒他，總是吃自己做的菜，他眞是勞苦萬分了。</p>
<p>二，嗜好跳舞的凱末爾</p>
<p>英氣卓絕的新土耳其英雄凱末爾，他出產於地中海濱的薩羅尼加，天生成的土耳其軍人性格，他的英語很好，所以他不唯常用英語說話，並且一切私信都用英語寫作，這樣極端的人，他决不和一般土耳其人一樣，坐於座墊之上，寢於褥榻之中，他坐用椅子而寢則必眠床上，凱末爾所保存的國風只有一種，就是那吃了燒牛肉和肉饅頭以後，悠悠地嚥飲咖啡一項習慣而已。</p>
<p>他是極勤於工作，拚命於遊玩的勞苦者爵士舞Jazz之輸入土耳其和跳舞之在土耳其流行，完全是凱末爾之功，其中特別是探戈舞，狐步舞為他最得意的種類，凱末爾在當世獨裁者中，可說是一位摩登老爺。</p>
<h3>觀梅（下）</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>但我這旺盛的欣賞慾决不是每天隔窗觀看就能滿足的，故卽在日中，我也會挾着一卷我所愛讀的書，踱向那雪花般樸素，烟霧般迷離的梅花林下去，坐在那邊的一塊方臺上，一面翻着書，一面觀賞着梅花，那輕風送過來陣陣的清香撲向鼻竅裏去，讓我陶醉着。當我看到有趣味的時候，書卷也會由我手中掉落到草地上去，意識裏祇覺得有一樣東西和眼前的梅花在一起眩惑住我，然而那東西究竟是什麼呢？我一時可記不清，不過，總之它是有力的把我誘惑着，把我抓住着，使我那樣悠然神往！</p>
<p>偶然有兩頭小鳥在梅林的枝椏間穿梭般的飛繞着，它們似亦很快樂的跳躍噪呌，一株又一株的，使這梅花頗不感到寂寞。但有時碰動一下細枝，會驚得那些梅瓣忽忙地脫離了枝頭有飄向地下來，飄着飄着，一片跌在草徑裏，一片又重新落了下來，不倦地飄，飄，飄，終於，這枯灰色的草徑上，浮滿了一片一片的白色東西。而更有幾片，像迴舞着的縞衣的孤孀似地，便親熱的貼落在我的肩上及髮里；我彎回了衣袖細看，覺得它似一片纖巧的圖案。接在手掌中，令我起了一種憐惜的愛撫。我頗想拾些珍藏起來，和珍藏自己的生命一樣。</p>
<p>——歸來的遊子呵！在不久你又將流浪到天涯海角去了，可是你唯一的知己——梅花，明年再來時，你也許不會來伴我們了吧，我在無言的靜默裏，領會了梅花給我的諷刺，可是我終於感到了慚愧和痛苦。仰起頭，又是一片梅花的落瓣印上了我的額際，我不禁打了一個寒戰。就那樣地一個遣志了多年的記憶，回到我的腦子裏來，我記起了我的流浪生活，記起那個看梅的希望，記起我童年的天眞和無知的快樂，記起………</p>
<p>一種青年人被衰老浸透了的心情，悽然地橫過了我這寂寞的心地：</p>
<p>——那可貴的青春是不再會回來了，可是那童年所看過的梅花，如今還是一樣地可愛！</p>
<h3>野花的毒香</h3>
<p>— 樂家</p>
<p>告犯了雙層罪惡者</p>
<p>“家花那有野花香”，這句話也許說得不錯，但野花的香氣常常是有毒的，聞了這種毒香，會給愛採野花的人一種嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>同樣的，不顧自己的家室而到外面去野合的人，他也要沾染上淋毒的，患了這種淋濁，會給他一種難言的痛苦。</p>
<p>並自，患淋濁的人，不但要害了自身，並且要禍貽妻子，那就可說是“雙層的罪惡”，還說甚麼“家花不如野花香”呢？</p>
<p>至於淋病染身，務宜趕快治療，因為初患急性時期，雖然痛苦較甚，但是也易根治。倘使因循不治，或服無效藥物，那就要成延綿的慢性，隨時有突發淋毒性變症的危險，所以淋病患者唯有速服“的立平”，它係依據最新學理的處方，築力能直達病灶，澈底殲滅淋菌，不論新舊淋濁，婦女白帶，和一切淋濁併發症，服之都能奏效，而達全愈。犯了雙層罪惡，或想免犯者，都請注意。</p>

<h3>推行公醫制度之先决條件（上）</h3>
<p>— 朱季靑（講）蒯文泉（記）</p>
<p>諸位同學，公醫制度這四個字，從你們到了衛生署公共衛生人員訓練班來，已充滿了耳鼓，究竟用什方方法，實現公醫制度所以對於公醫制度之先决條伯不可不有相當的研究，現在將個人研究所得，說出來，不能說是演講，希望諸同學加以判評，這是個人的願望。</p>
<p>公醫制度的動機為什麼要有公醫制度呢？不是偶然的，是有根據的，從兩方面看來：</p>
<p>國際方面觀察，我們可以找出三個原因：</p>
<p>一·歐戰以前與歐戰以後，人民思想完全不同，歐戰可算是歐洲方面政治經濟教育大轉變之關節，歐戰以前是以少數人之觀念，沒有根基的，經歐戰以後完全改變，是從最低層做去的，飄飄然在上層是不行的，就拿醫學來看，以前有化學生理學解剖學等，而今醫學的進步，覺得以前學術是不夠的，還要研究社會學相輔而行，才易於收效，因為醫學不是純粹科學，是要從社會觀念故起的。</p>
<p>二·美國總統胡佛在一九二七年組織醫事消息費調查委員會有五年計劃，至一九三二年發表，他的結果，不但美國本身覺得是個打擊，而且也是國際的打擊，人家也說醫事組織之錯誤，我們就不能再去抄襲了。</p>
<p>三·蘇俄及東歐幾國的醫事建設，他們已實行現代醫學之革命，而蘇俄療病之術，素操之於私人之手，因之醫學設施漫無組織，而復以個人之利益為依據，蘇俄對此傳統觀念，盡行破除，而創立一種根據合理的設計與組織之社會化的醫事設施，足資吾人借鏡。</p>
<p>國內動機有五：</p>
<p>一·國民健康破產　死亡率比人家高，人壽比人家短，講質而不講量比不上人家，而我國國民體格訓練早經議决未見實行，但是當局至少有了相當的認識。</p>
<p>二·國民經濟薄弱</p>
<p>衛生經費在鄉村每人不能超出一毛，在城市每人不能超出三毛半至五毛，國民經濟，其薄弱之程度，達於極點。</p>
<p>三·國民敎育低弱</p>
<p>根據定縣調查每人平均五毛，每家平均五元，用於舊醫藥或拜神求佛之類，這樣的迷信甚深，欲剷除殆盡，非敎育不可。</p>
<p>四·醫事人才缺乏</p>
<p>根據衛生署民國二六年一月十一日止的統計，全國醫師共有八千匹百二十二名，就算還有二千名醫師沒有登記，平均四萬人一個醫師，而登記的牙醫十九名，助產士二千九百六十四名，藥劑生二千二百六十九名，至於護士佔計起來約七八千名，共計醫藥人才，不到二萬人，以我國土地之大，人民之衆，無濟於世，但是醫師集中在城市，農村無有也，故我國有百分之八十至八十五農民，得不着科學醫藥之保障。</p>
<p>五·現在醫事設施不普及</p>
<p>現在我國除少數通商大埠有科學醫藥之設備外，在偏僻交通不便之農村，則為數幾等於零。</p>
<p>國內有了這五個困難，而國際醫事問題，近乃獲得相當解决，因此國內與國際的醫事情形如此，而形成適合潮流而又能適合國內農村經濟狀况的一個辦法，想來想去，就是一個公醫制度。</p>
<p>公醫制度的意義：</p>
<p>一·公醫制度是有目標的增進及保障全民健康。</p>
<p>二·公醫制度是有計劃的譬如出門行路，由出發點到目的地，其中間必有障礙物，如遇障礙而立卽打倒，這是革命方法，在我國社會情形之下，是不允許的。如遇障礙而暫退縮，待機前進，目的地終必可達，這是演進方法，我們為了推行公醫制度是需要的，如遇障礙而退縮不前，竟然變換了方向，我們也是不需要的。</p>
<h3>腸結核症之檢討</h3>
<p>— 鍾志和</p>
<p>夫潰瘍性腸結核。為肺結核症中最習見之併發病也。據美國紐約Metrpoliton　Hospital之屍體解剖。肺結核症之死亡者。其百分之七十二患有潰瘍性腸炎。據Brown及Sampson氏之調查。肺結核症死亡而呈現腸結核者。約佔百分之五十至八十。據Montcfiare　Hospital之統計。五百二十六肺結核症死亡者。其中併發腸結核症者。佔三百四十四人。適為百分之六十五。</p>
<p>又在美國紐約美曲波立頓醫院有肺結核患者七百四十四人。經愛克司光檢查。巴患有潰瘍性腸炎。但在檢騐時其現胃腸症狀者。祇百分之二十九。</p>
<p>經多數醫家研究之結果。謂陽性痰液。（含結核桿菌）對於腸結核症大有關係。該院統計七百四十患腸結核症。而其中痰液属陰性者祇四·五％。</p>
<p>此外肺部之空洞Cavities。與潰瘍性腸炎。亦有直接與密切之關係。據統計百分之九十五患有潰瘍性腸炎者。其肺部均有空洞之發見。茲將關於腸結核之種種分述如次以供參政。——</p>
<p>（甲）腸結核症之部位</p>
<p>腸結核症之部位甚堪注意。查其大部受染處。均在闌腸及迴腸末段。闌尾及升結腸等處。</p>
<p>據Roepke氏之調查。在開放性肺結核症病人。其全部腸管受累者。佔百分之五十。而損害之在小腸者。佔百分之九十。在結腸者佔百分之八十。在闌尾者佔百分之七十。自闌腸至直腸則漸次遞减矣。</p>
<p>據Maylerd引證Feuwick及Dodwel氏之統計。八百八十三肺結核死亡者。其間五百人腸中。發見潰瘍。而結腸部佔數獨多。計升結腸佔百分之五十一·四。橫結腸佔百分之三十·六。降結腸佔百分之二十一。乙狀結腸佔百分之十三·五。</p>
<p>（乙）腸結核如何受染</p>
<p>㊀結核桿菌經血運循環。而達腸部以致受染。</p>
<p>㊁結核桿菌經淋巴循環。而使腸部受染。</p>
<p>㊂肺癆患者如痰液中含有結核桿菌。而將痰液下嚥。經胃部而不受胃酸之殺滅。則腸部漸致受染</p>
<p>（丙）腸結核之症狀</p>
<p>㊀夜間腹瀉Night　Stool。係最有價值之症狀。蓋普通之結腸炎。其腹瀉多在早晨也。</p>
<p>㊁恒久性腹瀉。亦為腸結核症之特徵。腹瀉之次數輕者每日僅二三次。但重症者每日可自八至十數次。甚或達二十次以上不等。然有時亦起交互性便閉。</p>
<p>㊂便稀薄色棕黑。或呈渣古律色。惡臭異常。每含有腸之脫腐物及血液。（或隱匿血液）但亦有百分之十至二十病人竟呈便閉者。</p>
<p>㊃體溫常升騰而稽留。或時升時降。變遷無定。</p>
<p>㊄現比較性心動徐緩Bradycardiac</p>
<p>㊅體重銳減。因食慾不振。以及腸消化缺功。並食物至腸之不能被腸吸收而卽行洩出之故。以致體重日减。消瘦異常。據Fishberg氏之經騐。謂病人有時數月所得之體重。可貴難能者。每於一星期中消失殆盡。經兩至四星期。一變而為骨瘦如柴。憔悴不堪者矣。</p>
<p>㊆貧血甚劇。面色蒼白。形如古銅。至症之末期。四肢常呈浮踵。及氣急煩躁不安等狀。</p>
<p>（丁）腸結核之預防法</p>
<p>㊀勸止病人切忌將痰液下嚥。並告以利害。使知所警惕。</p>
<p>㊁凡胃酸缺乏。以致結核桿菌不易殺滅者。當加服稀釋之氤㲶酸（鹽酸）以加强胃殺釛之力。</p>
<p>㊂注意腸之鬱積並防止便閉。</p>
<p>㊃遇有胃腸消化不良等狀之肺核症患者。當從早診斷加以治療。腹瀉者更宜如此。</p>
<p>（戊）腸結核之治療法</p>
<p>㊀改良肺癆病人嚥痰之惡習。又當急於設法。以抑止肺部損害。如施用人工氣胸術。膈神經切斷術胸廓成形術。或油胸術。使痰液早日變成陰性。不含結核桿菌。則可减少其毒素之吸收。而腸部症狀自可减輕。</p>
<p>㊁病人必須臥床休息。（A）蓋多半病人。其肺結核症仍屬活動性。休息則可减少由血運循環等傳染之機會。（B）休息可减少腸部之刺激。及蠕動有利於損害。</p>
<p>㊂腸結核病人。其食物之選擇極關重要。（A）當减少飲料之納入量。冷飲料能刺激腸管。多起蠕動。而致腹瀉及腹痛。尤須禁絕。（B）當供給富含滋養。及高價熱力單位之食物。並各種適量之維生素Vitamins。（C）凡蔬菜多含植物纖維者不宜多食。脂肪水菓糖食蜜䬻等以禁食為宜。蓋此項食物能醱酵。而發生氣體。令病人痛苦難堪。（D）能忍受牛乳者可多服牛乳。然食後覺有不適者。可加入石灰水或重炭酸鈉。Sodiumbicarbonate或咖啡及可可粉等。諸種食物。均以乘熱食之為妥。（E）生蛋生牛乳不易消化。且易起腹脹作噯氣並腹瀉等。以不食為宜。（D）多食丙種維生</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>素。Vitamin　C.如西紅柿（蕃茄）或桔子茄。如將蕃汁或桔子汁四倍。和魚肝油一倍同同肢。每日三次極佳。又胃腸炎以及慢性胰臟病。均因甲種維生素缺乏所致。用之治腸結核尤具功效。與丁種維生素同用更佳。</p>
<p>㊃熱療法凡腹瀉者。在每餐後用熱水袋置於腹部。能助消化及弛緩腸之痙攣。腹之𤶀痛當可减輕矣。此外患者當保持溫暖。腹部尤須注意。凡飲料與食物以熱者為上。如施用Rland　enemas大有佐助之效。在腹中充氣者。呵加入松香油一茶匙。以為直陽灌溉。其效甚佳。以熱鹽水行直腸灌溉亦佳。</p>
<p>㊄病人排洩之大便。當惡行殺菌。輓近據醫師之報告。謂迨金氏溶液。Dakin's　Solution對結核桿菌之殺菌力最强。可用以防止傳染。他種消毒殺菌結亦可施用。</p>
<p>㊅光綫療結。首推天然日光以及紫外光綫。Ultto　Violetrays但因患者多半有肺結核。施用不當有損無害。不可不愼。現在有主張用愛克司光治療者。</p>
<p>㊆藥物療法。（A）可服固醇生素。</p>
<p>因其有增加鈣質被吸收之價值。（B）腹痛可用熱敷袱法。並服鎮靜劑。如鴉片頰製劑或其誘導體。或可用硫酸阿刀便Atropin　Sulphate內服或皮下注射。以弛緩腸管之痙攣。（C）腹瀉可服鞣酸製劑有止歛之功。鉍製劑有止瀉之效。硫酸製Barium　Sulphate或克疴明Kaomin等劑亦具同樣之效用。（D）施用鈣劑治療。蓋鈣劑至腸。一則能使腸內之脂肪變成石灰化鹼。而具收歛之作用。二則當其被吸收時。有弛緩腸管痙攣之功能。行靜脈注射收效較速。常用者如百分之五至百分之十的㲶化鈣或葡萄糖鈣十西西隔日行之。（E）貧血者。除給予脾臟製劑內服或注射外。或可施用輸血法Blood　trausfusion（完）</p>

<h3>農村衛生事業推進的先决問題（續）</h3>
<p>— 衣旦</p>
<p>㊂醫藥務求平民化</p>
<p>這幾年來，因着天災人禍的影響，整個的農村是達極度的不景氣的狀態，農村漸次沒落，大有自食不足之趨勢，因農村基礎的根本上失敗，而農村經濟亦隨着呈現出恐慌的現象來，這種不良的現象，我們隨時隨地都可找得實證决無可諱言的。試想他們那裏還有一筆餘欵來作治療費呢？我敢說，他們平常就根本沒有這樣的想頭，這是從實質方面說，同時我們該知道的，就是今日之中國農民，因為身體久處於這樣困苦艱難之境界中，無形中已養成節儉耐勞的習慣所以就是一些極少數的土財主們，我們看去，吃的還是粗糙不堪的米麥，穿的是襤衣破縷，使你絕不會想到他是具有幾萬家財的人物，總而言之，他們的想思是受着環境的變遷而轉移了！他們認為金錢比生命還來得重要，於是大多數農民，因着經濟的枯窘，固屬是有病無錢醫治，祇得苦苦的硬挨，就是少數的財主吧？雖是有病，但他寗願忍受病中的痛苦，决不輕易化錢醫治，必得到了病重身危，才願化幾個送死錢，這是已成了普遍的現象。從這類形勢看來，農村醫藥是必得力求平民化，而且在他們的經濟能力之下是能辦到的，大衆農民才願樂意地來應診，求治，也才能夠使大衆的農民得着實惠，由此農民對於我們所施的衛生方法，便可刻下深深地的良好的印象在腦際。</p>
<p>㊃促進農產的增加</p>
<p>農村的經濟，應視農產的多寡為準繩，因為農村經濟的本源，就是從農產中獲得的，這是很顯然的事實，目睹今日我國農村經濟狀况，勢已達極度崩潰之地步，因而所謂醫藥務求平民化的寫出，正就是補救這一點的缺陷，可是我們一徑的接着那樣的方法行下去，勢必不能獲得最後的美滿效果，試想在中國這樣的廣大農村，當局那裏有這樣一筆預算的經費，來充救濟農村之用呢？所以我們唯一的辦法，是同待還得促進農產的加增，與辦水利等有益於農事生產之事業，使農村經濟根本上有了活躍的發源，庶幾農村的經濟，自可由此一振而復為活動起來，如此則可造成國强民富，歌舞昇平之情象，一方面當然政府對於這項衛生的經費的供給，也可寬裕，那麼，同時農民方面對於新醫藥之供給，衛生之設施，亦可得以享受相當之代價了。因此我們可以說，促進農產的加增，是推進農村衛生的最大力量。</p>
<p>㊄保持自然的衛生</p>
<p>原來農民處於那樣的環境中，除去鎮日地度着那糞窖般的小區域中的人畜合羣的生活而外，無形的，自然界已賜與他們很多的恩惠—是合於衛生的！如新鮮的空氣，充分的日光，美麗悅目的風景，以及半裸體時有礙所觀瞻的工作，受日光的照溚等。同時他們那樣早起出外工作，晚歸甜蜜安睡的習慣，也都形成了自然的現象，這類自然的現象，在衛生的條件下，都是最為適合的，在繁華的都市裏那裏能夠享受到這樣優遇的環境，同時都市中的老爺，太太，小姐，又那裏能有那樣偉大可佩的習慣呢？所以在這推進農村衛生的當兒，實在有提出來申述的必要，因為我們若能夠來注意保持這類自然的衛生，可以使農民信仰的决心愈加堅决更可以得到不費力的帮助，而促進農村衛生的推進。</p>
<p>㊅取締郎中和穩婆</p>
<p>據馬薩斯的人口諭說：人口的繁殖，依幾何級數增加，每廿五年就要增加一倍。所以不得正式比例的病魔的戕賊，實占最大原因。單就農村中的郎中和穩婆毒害生侖的數字而言，簡直沒有數字可以統計。而現今以上這類不三不四的江湖術士，差不多還是撒滿了整個的農村，他們的手段眞是乖巧不過，他們能夠誘惑大衆的農民，投入到他們的迷網中，使大衆農民都信仰他們，和他們作一個密切的吻合，認為郎中是一個唯一的醫治者，穩婆是一個接生的能手，無異的，這樣工作已經成為他們鐵一般飯碗，他然的生機當然就憑作這一點上，可是新構成的事實，是不是能夠使農民得到實惠呢？我敢說，在他們那樣不合科學，無醫藥的知識棘手下，是絕對不會有美滿的收效，我們祇要稍加留意，農民疾病的夭亡，和生產的冤死，數字眞令人心驚，這種超格的死亡，顯然證明着是他們所造成的慘劇，但是他們手腕眞靈敏，為防着無能的暴露，而加上“醫得病，醫不得命”這類含混其詞的術語，來掩飾他們的罪惡。現在革新農村衛生的實踐，無異是給於他們的當頭一棒，而他們在這壽命危急的險象下，自然在大衆農民信仰他們的時刻，來作狡滑的宣傳，同時大衆農民的心理，當然始終是傾向他們那邊的，因此對我們就成了一個有力的問接反攻，這種競爭勢態便成了目前推進衛生的一個極大障礙物，那麼，我們怎樣能不設法來取締呢？</p>
<p>㊆結論</p>
<p>這幾個條件問題，我們當然還不能說是已經完備，然而我看却可認為是推進農村衛生的幾個中心條件，而且假若拋棄着任何一條，就有阻碍其他條件推動的可能性，因而我可以說，要得我國目前的農村衛生，開闢一條新的途徑，以上諸條件，便是我們應先解决的工作，若是我們能夠負起這使命，來切實進行，概可得有相當之收穫，但是我們不能就此認為滿足，必得再要產生新的辦法，因此不免要希望海內外諸衛生家，多有所貢獻來鞏固推進的力量，在這兒，我們須注意的，就是推進農村衛生的工作若謹靠衛生界單獨進行，速率一定是很遲緩，而且也不易得到可觀的成續，必得還要賴各方的繼續援助，互相連合起來共謀策進，方可達到最後目的而造成農民之幸福，强盛國家之基礎！（完）</p>
<h3>京滬蘇浙贛湘鄂等處衛生視察報告（四）</h3>
<p>— 儲晉芳</p>
<p>（三）經費概况</p>
<p>該局因衛生行政，年有推進，故經費亦遞增，茲將該局自二十一年至二十四年衛生經費支出預算數目，列表於下：</p>
<p>該局衛生經常經費之支配，清道所需，歷年均占支出總額之半數以上，次為衛生試騐及肉品檢騐費，次為治療費，總務費，防疫費，學校衛生費，衛生敎育費等。至於夏季大規模預防霍亂，及衛生運動等工作，則另以臨時費辦理之。</p>
<p>二·上海市立醫院該院設於上海市中心區衛生局之對面，基地約八十畝，合價三十萬元，建築費三十萬元，設備費十五萬元，共計所費為七十五萬元。規模宏大，但因時局緊張，設備裝置等，未能完全告竣，故開幕之期，尚須若干時日也。</p>
<p>該院院長一職，由同濟大學翁校長兼任，將來同濟大學醫學院學生，卽在該院從事實習。醫院與學校能得聯絡，雙方定多便利。</p>
<p>三·衛生試騐所</p>
<p>所址位於上海醫院旁，設備頗為完善，惜往視察時，因受時局之影響，該所已將一部份重要儀器用具收藏，未得窺其全豹，誠憾事也。</p>
<p>四·吳淞區衛生事務所</p>
<p>該所為上海市衛生局，同濟大學，及吳淞其他學校工廠聯合辦理，但行政權歸衛生局。注重辦理各種公共衛生事項，附設診療所，並有病房設備，病牀十餘張，每人每日收費三角，不分等級。俟上海市立醫院開幕後，病房卽擬取消，以全力辦理公共衛生云。</p>
<p>該所經費，每月為一千六七百元，由同濟大學補助五百元，衛生局撥給六百元，其餘則由各學校工廠等籌劃補助之。其衛生工作，除治療來所就診民衆之疾病外，並派醫師及公共衛生護士，分赴各學校工廠診療學生及工人之疾病，及辦理各學校工廠之一切衛生事宜。同時又為同濟大學一部份學生實地實習之塲所：以此各學校工廠均樂於籌助也。</p>
<p>再該診療所之掛號方法，係用患者年齡與該所成立年限之差數為標凖，使每一患者之病歷成一系統，俾便查考，為其他各處醫院診所所未見。其辦法如下：</p>
<p>以患者年齡，除去該所成立年限而計算之，譬如患者實在年齡為十一歲，而該所成立年限為五年，則以十一减五計算之，卽該患者於病曆上之年齡填寫六歲</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>總工會將用什麽方法帮助勞工呢？</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>上海市總工會，為推行勞動服務，改善工人家庭生活起見，特議决設立婦女勞工家庭服務團，分組出發服務。該團的工作，在於調查工友家庭的生活狀况，並指導勞工家庭衛生，及子女教育等事項。這種辦法，可說是很好的，足見總工會關心勞工生活的一斑。</p>
<p>勞工家庭生活的艱苦，是大家所知道的。他們終年辛苦，出賣血汗，對於社會，貢獻不能不算大。但其生活情形，却如牛馬一樣。因為工人所得的報酬極微，起碼的衣食住，也有不能維持之概。</p>
<p>近來頗有人注意到一般勞工生活，主張應保障勞工。然保障勞工，說是容易的，實行便有點困難。由國家法律保障，自是有力的。但我國也不是沒有保障勞工的法律，結果收效甚少。要求僱主優待，願意當是求之不得的。但僱主大都只見本身的利益，不問工人的死活。他們正想盡法子，作無厭的剝削。</p>
<p>那未這種責任，就落在工會的身上。工會是為勞工謀幸福的一種組織，負有代一班工人解除痛苦，救濟生活的任務。上海市總工會的决議設立婦女勞工家庭服務團，用意便也在此。</p>
<p>但總工會將用什麼方法帮助勞工呢？調查工友家庭的生活狀况，是必要的。指導勞工家庭衛生，及子女教育，對於工人，也很有益。然僅行調查，還是不夠的。調查之後，設法謀改善他們的生活，才是重要的工作。</p>
<p>該團的家庭訪問，在於注意勞工最痛苦的為何，最希望的為何。這一點在我們看來，一般工人，最痛苦的，必是生活的艱難。同時最希望的，必是生活的改善。這並不是設想之詞，事實如此，大家是看得見的。</p>
<p>故我們很希望總工會在舉行調查之後，對於一班勞工家庭生活，能有多少的救濟。這不但工人受其賜，也是社會的福利。</p>
<h3>熱帶魚的訪問</h3>
<p>— 南菊</p>
<p>熱帶魚，這一個富有誘惑性的名字，又在這奢華富麗的是海出現了。有許多人或許不明白，熱帶魚究竟是一種什麼魚，記者昨天特地到新近上海開設的“好白相魚店”去，作了一次熱帶魚詳細的訪問，現在根據“好白相魚店”主人李一鶴先生的話，寫在這裏，以供本報讀者的參考。</p>
<p>好白相魚店的地點是在巨籟達路三一二號，門面作深紅色，佈置很雅緻；店主人李一鶴先生飼養熱帶魚已經有二三年的歷史，所以對於熱帶魚的飼養，價格，種種都很清楚，現有我們且分開來講：</p>
<p>熱帶魚的種類　熱帶魚的種類很多，大致一共總有一二百種，現在好白相魚店所備的，大約有二三十種；說到熱帶魚，最能使人發生興趣的，是魚的色彩與樣子，現在且舉出幾種：㊀神仙魚—這一種魚，式樣最好看，肚皮扁而闊，尾巴上有長鬚，當牠在透明的玻璃缸裏浮沉於水底的時候，的確好看；㊁玻璃魚—這一種魚最有趣的是牠全身的骨骼，完全透明的，牠身上每一梗小刺，都看得清清楚楚；㊂彩色魚—這種魚，小時作灰色，等稍大，全身能變作五彩色，色彩漂亮極了。此外如“長嘴魚”，魚很小，上嘴唇有一梗長刺，牠常常浮在水面上，不大肯游到水底下去；三角魚，魚身作三角形；紅齒魚，魚身作淡紅色；馬賽克魚，全身作扁灰色。</p>
<p>另外還有兩種很奇怪的魚，一種呌作“鬥魚”，樣子像金魚，但魚身作藍色，來自印度，這種魚性好鬥，兩魚相遇，便在水裏撲鬥，印度人常常利用這種“鬥魚”作賭博；還有一種“呌魚”，魚身狹長，能在水中低鳴。</p>
<p>熱帶魚的出產地　熱帶魚的出產地，以德國居多，此外印度，墨西哥，美國都有；這種魚因為一向生長在熱帶的溫水裏，所以帶到中國來根不容易，往往田輪船上帶回來的魚，到半路上便死掉了。</p>
<p>飼養的方法　養熱帶魚的水，溫度平均總要在七十六度到八十度，太熱得滲入冷水，太冷得使水的溫度增加；所以現在特製養魚的玻璃盒（五面透明的），裏面附有一溫度表，隨時得視察水的溫的增减。魚的食料是水虫，大約一天喂四次；水可以常常換。玻璃魚缸裏，底層是細沙，另外更種了許多由檀香山來的水草。普通水草，熱度一溫會爛，這種水草却不。</p>
<p>魚的繁殖　熱帶魚的生殖，可以分作兩種：一種是胎生，一種是子生。有一種呌杜夫格拉米魚的，牠的繁殖很有趣，先是雄的，在水面吐一種白沫，然後牠把雌魚趕到白沫裏去任牠生子，等雌魚生子在草上以後，馬上把雌魚移到別的玻璃缸去，否則牠自己會把所生的子，自己吃掉。</p>
<p>魚的價格　因為這種魚不容易帶到上海來，所以價錢也貴得很，普通小魚，也得五塊錢一對，連一隻特制的玻璃缸，總要十多塊錢。大一點的魚，竟要十幾塊錢一對的，而且不會養，就容易死。即是檀香山的水草，也要賣一塊錢五寸，有的還只賣二寸，實在是太貴族化了。</p>
<h3>棚户之春</h3>
<p>— 馬夢塵作</p>
<h3>雨天的故事</h3>
<p>— 汪聲天</p>
<p>一到了雨天，我便好像有許多故事要向自己述說出來，才覺得舒服似的：樹枝上的雨滴，茅草下的雨珠，以至於田塍裏一垜一垜的雨水，都會使我牽想起少年時光帶來的印象，這些印象，像一雙雙雪亮的眼睛，注視着我使我迴避不過去。</p>
<p>在山谷裏採茶葉的時候，我曾經勇敢地在茶樹上浴一整天的雨，把衣衫濕淋得沒有半寸乾紗，但是，心地裏還是很喜歡地，採了滿筐的茶葉回到家裏去</p>
<p>一次一次我都是冒着雨在田間工作的，不帶簑衣也不帶箬笠，春天我喜歡這樣，夏天我更喜歡這樣。一月間當黃黃地油菜花飛滿了一畦一畦的田壟時，我拿着鋤頭到田間裏去鬆土，一面把簸箕盛滿着油菜心，倘若在這個時候，雨絲牽到我的頭上的話，我一定和牧牛的老三他頑皮，開心起來串着說，“老天公，不要哭，請你布壽又布福！”</p>
<p>暮春的天氣，老天是時常喜歡扮臉的，這時候的田間工作，就輕鬆下來了，於是，我通常地被家裏的人派到鄰村去焙茶，焙茶的時節，十天總有八天落雨的，焙茶的房間裏，又多是十幾歲的鄉姑娘，後腦下面長着一條用紅絨綫紮的小辮子：幾個年老的人很閒散自如地監視着，這樣，屋外是瀟瀟的雨聲，屋裏是熱殷殷的歌聲笑聲。</p>
<p>有一次芸和我在一起焙茶，她是一個嬌小活潑天眞的鄉下小姑娘，不知道為什麼事故，她和我談起天落雨的事情了。</p>
<p>“你不知道天落雨這回事嗎？”她睜開了一雙大眼睛，眼睛裏帶着滿足的懷疑!</p>
<p>我只搖搖頭，表示不知道。</p>
<p>“哪，你不知道天落雨這回事嗎？是這樣的，天晴的晚上不是可以看得見許多星嗎？這許多星便是老天的眼睛，因為他要看我們地上許多人的緣故，所以才有這許多眼睛，老天是待我們頂好的，無論什麼人他都一律看待，沒有偏心的！我們看見太陽出來的日子，這便是老天和我們指明說,他是很快樂,很開心的，因為地上許多人，做的許多事，都很合稱老天爺的心;如果有一天，天公是變了，雨便一陣一陣的落下來的日子，這就和我們表明說，地上的許多人，造罪，作孽；使老天爺氣了，傷心;所以流淚……</p>
<p>“那麽，為什麽白天看不見星呢？”我知道她杜撰故事，於是這樣反驳她，</p>
<p>“你眞是十全十美的呆子呀！這樣普通的事情，虧你還不知道，我要問你，人是不是要睡觉的，睡觉的時候，眼睛怎麽樣，……我們人是晚上睡覺，老天是白天睡觉的……</p>
<p>芸做了新娘子以後，我們見面的機會就很少了；自然這樣童話式的雨天故事，就永遠聽不見了。</p>
<p>最近有一個人從西村跑到我的家裏來，告訴我們說芸吊死了，並且告訴我們說，有芸死的前一日，他的父親還做了一個合家慘死的夢；以後，從西村來的人還向我們鄭重申明着說，芸的吊死，還算是芸家的福氣厚呢……</p>
<p>初春已步入人間了，連綿不斷的春雨，也要跟着而來的；當我的腦子讓雨天弄得孤寂了的時候，我便想起了芸講雨天故事的神情，更想起了神權還在統治着內地鄉村的悲哀！</p>
<h3>迎神節</h3>
<p>— 南鷗</p>
<p>—南洋風俗記</p>
<p>還是年輕的孩子的時候，總是期待着一年一度的吉甯人底迎神節趕快到來。不用説這動機完全岀於凑熱閙，對於異種人所崇敬着的神，是説不上有什麽虔意的，而每當吉甯人歡天喜地，抬着他們底偶像在街上遊行的那二天，我和别的孩子們也同樣地歡狂；這樣的事情如今回想起來，真是令人感慨哩。</p>
<p>我們中國人把那樣一個節目呌做“吉甯鬼岀遊。”其實岀遊的是“神”，並不是“鬼”。在日間，吉甯人聚集的區域，就閙烘烘的了，他們到街上去喝酒，去享樂；而那平日門禁森嚴的神廟也開放了。於是，我和孩子們全攢到那神廟去，看到這擠擁的人底潮中，有穿着雜色紗籠的馬來人；藍眼珠子的荷蘭人；頂着紅紅緑緑的頭布的印度人；自然頂多的還是我們中國人。曾經聽過人家説</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>，開禁的吉寗神廟，是一個最現實的人種展覽大會塲，這真是恰當的形容。那一天出入在這神廟內外的人，何止千萬！我們是四處竄來竄去的，從這裏到那裏，終於看到了那端莊地坐在正殿的偶像。吉寗人虔誠地在它底面前磕着響頭，歐美底紳士們却站在一旁微笑，用一種獵奇的態度走來走去。年輕的吉寗人還聚在一起敲打着鼓；這鼓聲鼕鼕地傳送出來，從朝到夜，永遠不想停止似的。</p>
<p>最熱鬧的是到了晚上。南島底夜是吹着海水味的風的，繁星和月亮點綴在黑色的天上。爲了要維持街上的秩序的緣故，警察們全都忙碌出來了，而街底兩邊，很快地就聚攏了許多看熱鬧的人。我這時再也没有四處走動的自由了，老祖母一定要看管住我，恐怕我遭到什麽意外。她小心地領我到吉寗神要經過的街旁守候着。於是，焦急地等了又等，那刺耳的鼓聲終於可以聽見了。接着，火光在街底一端，亮了起來，鼓聲越來越響，一長串的人羣擁着那偶像徐徐地過來。在神像之前，有一對假面人在跳舞，八頭牛拖着那偶像，後面跟着的是數不淸的吉寗人。這樣的迎神節本來没有什麽特别可看的東西，但是擠擁的情形，却是你想像不到的。</p>
<p>吉寗人底隊伍就那麽走得遠了，這裏的人們就逐漸散去。老祖母於是也把我領回家，説道：「好啦，看過了迎神，該好好地睡覺了吧。」</p>
<p>這樣的迎神節期是兩天；第二天夜裏又照例熱鬧一番，還有烟火盛景，我自然要求老祖母領我去看。白的，紅的，綠的火花燃燒着，點綴了平静的南國底夜空，興奮了人們底情緒……</p>
<p>可是我底年紀是成長起來，漸漸地對於吉寗人底迎神節失了興味，再也没有那種趕熱鬧的心緒。而那殖民地底空氣終於有了使我窒息的一天，這樣，我就離開了生長地，回到祖國底懷抱中了。</p>

<h3>「慈母曲」中的人生世相</h3>
<p>「慈母曲」中之慈母林楚楚，她在青年時辛苦勤勞，撫育兒女，鞠躬盡瘁，及至暮年雖然是流浪天涯，飄泊無家，但仍處處維護兒女的幸福，寗願犧牲了自己，那種人間的至愛，曾使每一個參觀試映者爲之感泣。</p>

<h3>Newly Appointed Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui Arrives at Ministry to Assume Duties</h3>
<p>Summons All Ministry Staff for Address, Meets Chinese and Foreign Journalists, and Delivers Important Remarks</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Newly appointed Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui arrived at the ministry on the morning of the 8th to assume his duties. At 10:00 AM, he attended the weekly memorial service, led the ceremony, and after addressing all ministry staff, he met with the two Vice Ministers and various Directors-General, Counselors, and Secretaries. Former Foreign Minister Zhang Qun also visited the ministry around 11:00 AM to offer his congratulations. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, he met with news reporters, and at 5:00 PM, he met with foreign press reporters to express his views on foreign policy. Wang indicated that to ensure familiarity and expertise, he would not make significant changes to the existing ministry staff. Although Permanent Vice Minister Chen Jie expressed a strong desire to resign, Wang personally urged him to stay, and it is hoped that he will withdraw his resignation. On the 8th, only a ministry order was issued appointing Xu Gongsu as Director-General of General Affairs and Xie Weilin as Secretary with the rank of Senior Official. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The newly appointed Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui attended the Central Memorial Week on the morning of the 8th and then returned to his official residence. At 10:15 AM, Vice Ministers Xu Mo and Chen Jie arrived at his residence to escort him to the ministry to assume his duties. Mr. Wang went to the minister's office for a brief rest, and at 10:25 AM, he convened all ministry staff in the main auditorium for the weekly memorial service, leading the ceremony as usual. He then addressed all ministry staff, concluding at 10:45 AM. In the minister's office, he met with senior ministry officials in batches, offering words of encouragement. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, he met with news reporters in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reception room. Over thirty Chinese and foreign reporters were present. Minister Wang was amiable in his manner and sincere in his remarks. Finally, he cordially inquired whether any reporters had questions. The Chinese and foreign reporters all believed that Minister Wang's speech had clearly elucidated China's foreign policy and offered their thanks before departing. Minister Wang's address to the ministry staff and his remarks to the reporters were as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Address to Ministry Staff: Colleagues, former Minister Zhang resolutely resigned, and the government, appreciating his hard work, has granted his request and decided to have me succeed him. Former Minister Zhang has worked exceptionally hard over the past year amidst various difficult circumstances and has lived up to the expectations of the central government and the people. I deeply admire him. Although former Minister Zhang has now left this ministry, fortunately, he is still in Nanjing. He will continue to provide assistance from the sidelines based on his initial intentions of caring for this ministry. We should work together with one heart to serve the country. The meaning of the English term "Ship of State" lies in this. The nation is like a ship. The ship's mission is to brave the wind and waves to reach a predetermined destination. However, the ship itself cannot move. Therefore, to accomplish this mission, two conditions must be met: first, there must be a correct direction of travel, and second, those who operate the ship must each fulfill their duties and work together with one heart. With a correct direction, we can avoid straying onto the wrong path and avert danger. With the efforts of everyone, we can proceed quickly and ultimately reach our destination. National politics is also like this. Therefore, we who serve in the government must also adhere to the policies set by the central government and work together with one heart to overcome all difficulties to achieve the highest goals of the nation. I am assuming the responsibility of foreign affairs this time with this intention in mind. I am willing to work with my colleagues to further enhance the spirit of past efforts under the government's established policies, without shirking responsibility, without perfunctoriness, without fear of difficulties, and with harmony and unity, to move forward courageously in order to accomplish our mission.</p>
<p>▲ Remarks to Reporters: In modern times, the closeness of international relations is far greater than in the past. Without international cooperation, it is impossible to seek the prosperity of all nations and ensure world peace. To promote international cooperation, we must pay attention to the feelings of the people. Anything that hinders goodwill between the two sides should be diligently resolved or prevented first. Cooperation between nations must begin with sincere feelings, which then generates the desire for cooperation, and from the desire for cooperation arises the fact of cooperation. International cooperation must go through such stages to be successful. Our country's foreign policy has been repeatedly clarified by the central government and President Jiang. The integrity of the country's territory and sovereignty must be preserved. International relations must be based on equality and mutual benefit. Under these principles, we should strive to increase friendship through peaceful means. All political coordination and economic cooperation must be based on the principle of mutual benefit to seek closer mutual relations. This is the most reasonable principle of international negotiation and the established foreign policy of our government. I deeply feel the great responsibility upon assuming the responsibility of foreign affairs this time. I will certainly adhere to this intention, proceed diligently according to international justice and the norms of diplomacy, so that the government's established policies can be realized, and Sino-foreign relations can rely on international cooperation to achieve mutually beneficial development.

The headquarters of Zhang's troops and all personnel will leave Xi'an after all the troops have completely departed. Yu Xuezhong needs to handle the deployment of Zhang's troops and will only be able to come to Nanjing at the end of the month to report to the central government.

<h3>Japanese New Foreign Minister Issues Declaration on China Policy</h3>
<p>Equality and Spirit of Coordination, Striving to Break the Sino-Japanese Stalemate</p>
<p>[Tokyo] During a meeting of the House of Peers this morning, Viscount Okouchi, a member of the House of Peers, raised a question regarding foreign policy. Foreign Minister Sato answered, lasting 35 minutes. This was the Foreign Minister's first formal declaration on foreign policy since taking office, and all parties attached great importance to it. Although Sato lacks sufficient experience in domestic politics, his thinking and attitude have left a good impression due to his long exposure and activity on the international stage. This can be seen from the enthusiastic applause he received in the meeting place at the end of his speech. Sato said in his answer that a country's diplomacy should have its continuity, but circumstances often change, so it goes without saying that it is necessary to fully review the policies adopted by the previous cabinet. It is most important to find ways to change everything that is unsuitable for the current situation. Sato continued that one should not forget the other party in diplomacy. Although this statement seems ordinary on the surface, it is actually very meaningful. He also said that when domestic public opinion is extremely agitated and our country is dominated by strong opinions, this shortcoming of forgetting the other party can occur. That is, it is generally believed that no matter what our demands are, in what way they are made, or to what extent they reach, if they can be put forward in a tough manner, they will surely be fulfilled. However, the other party also has its own public opinion and often cannot accept our demands. This point is completely ignored by the general public. Therefore, temporary stagnation in diplomacy is unavoidable. This statement has a rather stern warning effect.</p>
<p>Regarding Anglo-Japanese diplomacy, Sato said that as far as he knows, after the Manchurian Incident, Britain believed that Japan's actions were limited to the north of the Great Wall. However, when Japan crossed the Great Wall and entered North China to carry out various activities, Britain became extremely worried that Japan's behavior might infringe on Britain's interests in North China, Central China, and even South China if it was not paid attention to. As for the North China issue, Japan's attitude has been clearly stated by the Prime Minister. I firmly believe that if we respect the interests of the other party and seek the peaceful development of China without antagonizing others, we can gain the understanding of other countries. This is the real way to protect Japan's interests. Sato's remarks were something that previous foreign ministers, from the scorched-earth diplomacy era to the concord diplomacy era, did not dare to say.</p>
<p>Sato then discussed diplomacy towards China, saying that it is undeniable that Sino-Japanese negotiations have reached a stalemate. However, I cannot endorse the claim that the negotiations have failed without any doubt. The current situation can only be regarded as an unfortunate moment that has caused the greatest difficulty. But what kind of policy should be adopted to break the stalemate is a very big problem. Especially after the Manchurian Incident, the disputes over many difficult events have reached their peak. If I can speak frankly, the current Sino-Japanese problem can only be solved if we change our approach and start from a new starting point. Negotiations between fully independent countries should be based on equal footing. This is the normal path of international relations and there is nothing surprising about it. However, this natural principle is often forgotten. In some cases, especially in the relationship between nationals, we often hesitate to adopt an equal footing and assume a superior position. This superior concept often causes great obstacles in international relations. After Sato put forward abstract fundamental principles to warn the people of the country, he entered into a concrete discussion and asked: In Sino-Japanese negotiations and events between the people of the two countries, have we ever proceeded on an equal footing? This question is left entirely for you to answer yourself, but I believe that everything in the past should be left to flow eastward, and negotiations should be conducted from a new perspective with equal footing. This is not a special concession to China's demands, nor is it a special response. China often accuses Japan of not granting equal relations and demands that all negotiations should be based on equal footing, etc. If China is not satisfied with this point, I believe that there will often be obstacles in the smooth progress of Sino-Japanese negotiations. Regarding this level, I believe that the concept of equality versus inequality should be abandoned, and instead, a heart-to-heart attitude should be adopted to fully consider China's demands and the rights that are closely related to China. At the same time, the interests that are closely related to Japan should also be explained sincerely. We are willing to maintain the spirit of coordination within the scope of not sacrificing the interests that are closely related to Japan and resuming negotiations based on equal footing. Although it is not known how China will react to this, if they are determined, Japan will undoubtedly provide various conveniences, even changing the content of past negotiations.</p>
<p>Sato's above-mentioned declaration on diplomacy towards China has not been heard in practice since Kijūrō Shidehara. In the current situation, it sounds like a lone voice in an empty valley. Although it remains doubtful whether Sato can cope with concrete problems according to such fundamental beliefs and overcome the difficulties within Japan when implementing them, judging from Sato's basic approach to China, it is indeed more progressive than Kōki Hirota and Hachirō Arita. It is heard that the army is deeply concerned that Sato's speech may cause China to adopt a tough attitude and expresses deep concern about China's possible reaction.

<p>[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan believes that the state establishes official positions to select and employ capable individuals to jointly manage governance. In recent years, the government has revised and supplemented various regulations on the appointment of civil servants, originally hoping that the promotion of personnel administration would be beneficial, personnel appointments would follow the correct path, and abuses could be eliminated. However, it has been found that many administrative personnel in various provinces and cities are still not appointed according to the law, and the documents submitted by the provincial and municipal governments for the appointment and dismissal of personnel often lack clear descriptions and have erroneous procedures. In order to rectify personnel administration and improve efficiency, the Executive Yuan has specially provided the following points to note and issued a circular for strict compliance: ㊀ When various agencies submit applications or requests for personnel to be appointed at the recommended or simplified level, there should be a basis in the organizational regulations. These organizational regulations are limited to those that have been clearly promulgated by the National Government or approved for record-keeping. ㊁ If current personnel in various agencies hold positions that, according to organizational regulations, are at the recommended or simplified level but have not yet completed the procedures for recommendation or request for simplification, they should immediately handle them in accordance with laws and regulations to await official appointment. ㊂ Once simplified or recommended personnel who have been officially appointed by the National Government leave their posts, the responsible supervisor should immediately select qualified personnel to act as agents and, at the same time, submit a request to dismiss the departing personnel, along with the review form for the appointment of the proposed personnel and supporting documents, for recommendation or request for simplification to comply with legal procedures. ㊃ If the original personnel have already left their posts, and there is not enough time to select qualified personnel to succeed them, a special request should first be submitted to dismiss the departing personnel. ㊄ The reason for the departure of the departing personnel, whether it is a request to leave, another appointment, awaiting another appointment, or dismissal, should be stated separately to allow for official announcements and provide a basis. In the event that the original personnel leave due to illness, a request for record-keeping should also be submitted at any time. ㊅ In addition to following the Civil Servant Appointment Law and its Implementation Rules when recommending or requesting simplified appointment of proposed personnel, if there are separate regulations for the appointment procedure, those separate regulations should also be followed.

<h3>Two Central Commemorative Weeks</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang Zhaoming Presides and Reports　Striving for Implementation of Proposals Submitted by the Plenary Session　Chairman Lin Speaks on the Relationship between Industry and National Defense</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Government held its 66th Commemorative Week on the morning of the 8th. Attendees included Central Committee members Wang Zhaoming, Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Wang Chonghui, Zhang Ji, Sun Ke, Chu Minyi, Fang Juehui, Zhou Qigang, Li Wenfan, Yu Feipeng, Jiang Zuobin, Jing Hengyi, Liu Jiwen, Gan Naiguang, Cheng Qian, Wu Boqun, Li Zonghuang, Wang Yongbin, Chen Bijun, Gu Zhengding, Gu Zhenglun, Lai Lian, Xu Sizeng, Peng Xuepei, and more than fifty other committee members, as well as approximately 700 staff members. Chairman Wang Zhaoming presided over the ceremony and reported, stating that the Third Plenary Session had made various important resolutions regarding the current situation, such as diplomatic policies, the National Assembly, eradicating the Red menace, and economic construction, which have been clearly stated in the declaration. In addition, there were various other important proposals, some submitted to the Standing Committee, some to the Political Committee, and some directly to the responsible agencies. The Third Plenary Session lasted only a few days, and it was not possible to discuss and study all the proposals in detail within these few days. This is not unique to the Third Plenary Session; it has been the case with previous plenary sessions. In addition to deciding on the major issues to be resolved at present, other proposals are submitted to the standing committees for handling. What we should pay attention to now is that these standing committees, after receiving the cases submitted by the plenary session, should take up their responsibilities with all their might, first conducting detailed research and serious discussions, and then implementing them earnestly. If they find that these proposals are incomplete, they should be revised and supplemented. If they find that there is something greatly inappropriate or even difficult to implement, they should also point it out clearly and without hesitation. If it is of great importance, they should reconvene a plenary session to make a new decision. This is not impossible. Because these proposals are the result of months of reflection and accumulation by responsible comrades from various aspects of party affairs, politics, and economics, they should be given great importance. If they are casually shelved, as it was said in the past, imprisoning public affairs or causing them to travel constantly, then not only would it be a disservice to the hard work of the proposers, but it would also be a disservice to the trust of the plenary session. I have thought carefully about the reasons why resolutions are not made and actions are not taken. A comrade said it well: we must treat an unresolved case as a debt on our backs that we have not been able to repay. We should be vigilant at all times to seek repayment; otherwise, we are irresponsible. I would like to encourage myself with this point and share it with all comrades. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Government held a commemorative week at 10:00 AM on the 8th. Attendees included Deng Jia Yan, Jing Hengyi, Li Wenfan, Chen Shuren, Liu Jiwen, Chen Xunyong, Chen Qicai, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials and staff of the National Government and various ministries and departments, totaling more than 400 people. After leading the ceremony by Chairman Lin, he spoke on "Industrial Planning and National Defense Construction," first stating that the Third Plenary Session concluded last month, and the general guidelines for domestic and foreign policies have been explained in great detail in the conference declaration. We can only strive forward in accordance with the path shown. Next, he mentioned that the Soviet Union, through its efforts in economic construction, not only solved the people's livelihood problems when its five-year plan was completed, but also established a strong national defense for the Soviet Union. Germany, through the arduous struggle of the entire nation, finally broke the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles and recently implemented a four-year economic plan. The content of the plan requires the nationalization of the entire industry for national defense, the nationalization of consumption for national defense, and various other economic self-sufficiency measures, which are also national defense plans and national defense construction. He further stated that more than twenty years ago, President Sun Yat-sen recognized that to save China from danger, it was necessary to devote all efforts to economic construction and personally formulated an industrial plan, which was listed as one of the founding strategies. Detailed plans were made for transportation development, heavy industry development, agricultural improvement, and so on. Most of the industrial plan is a plan for developing transportation, especially railways. Over the past ten years, the country has been plagued by internal and external troubles, and this plan has not been implemented accordingly. When we recall the origins of national difficulties, we feel infinite emotions and shame. Finally, he said that summarizing the President's last instructions contains about three points: ㊀ Develop transportation as the foundation for all types of construction. ㊁ Seek the development of heavy industry for peacetime people's application and wartime military industry preparation. ㊂ Develop agriculture to achieve self-sufficiency in food. The purpose is to utilize our country's abundant resources, with the needs of national and ethnic survival as the principle, and seek industrial development. Therefore, the industrial plan is the national defense plan and the basic plan for our country's economic construction. Now that the foundation of unification has been formed, we hope that the entire nation will unite sincerely, support unification, and consolidate unification. Under the leadership of the unified government, we will save on food and clothing, endure hardship, and contribute our minds and bodies to the interests of the nation and ethnicity, engage in economic construction, and complete the important task of saving the nation from extinction.

<h3>Tianjin Korean Commits Murder, Beating a Deaf-Mute Chinese to Death</h3>
<p>Four Criminals Flee into the Japanese Concession　We Request the Japanese Police to Arrest the Murderers</p>
<p>[Tianjin] At 5:00 AM on the 8th, in the Weishi Chi Bathhouse on Jianwu Street in the South Market of Tianjin, two deaf-mute Chinese, Chai Yulin and Guo Renzhi, had a dispute and fight with two Koreans over a minor matter. The two deaf-mutes could not speak, and the two Koreans did not understand Chinese. People in the bathhouse could not resolve the situation. One Korean sustained a minor head injury from the beating. Police officers from the Fu'an Street Police Station arrived and took both parties to the Sixth Police Station, which then transferred them to the First Bureau. Because all the police officers in the station went to the police bureau to attend a meeting on the morning of the 8th, only one police officer escorted the four criminals. Unexpectedly, when they arrived in front of the Donghe Residence on Jianwu Street, another Korean suddenly stopped them to inquire and spoke with the two Korean criminals. The four suddenly joined forces to surround and beat Chai and Guo. The police officer was outnumbered and unable to stop them, so he ran back to report to the station. At this time, Chai was stabbed in the lower back with a short knife by one of the Koreans and fell to the ground. Guo was still fighting hard. By the time the police brigade arrived, the four Koreans had fled into the Japanese Concession. Chai was taken to the Municipal Hospital, but he died before he could be treated. Yan Jiaqi, the chief of the First Bureau, received the report and visited Wakui, the head of the Japanese Police Department, to request the arrest of the murderers. Subsequently, the Japanese side sent the head of the Special Affairs Team, Li Yunxiang, to investigate the truth and promised to assist in the arrest of the criminals. Chai's body was collected and buried by his son, Lianke. The police bureau interrogated Guo about the cause of the dispute. Guo could only write his name and address, as well as the fact that Chai was a newspaper vendor, but could not describe the case. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Pirates Discovered at the Border of Shandong and Hebei</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] More than one hundred pirates were discovered at Chengzi Mouth, the border between Shandong and Hebei. They blockaded the port and intercepted merchant ships. The "Beijiang" ship of the Tianjin Tongsheng Company, carrying 155 passengers, was sailing in the area when it heard the news and sent a message to Tianjin for help. The Maritime Police Bureau dispatched the "Flying Dragon" gunboat to assist. It had escorted them back to Dagu on the 8th. The passengers are safe, but the pirates are still lingering in the port. The authorities telegraphed Shandong for joint suppression. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>The Interior Ministry Plans to Increase Police Salaries</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of the Interior believes that in many provinces, cities, and counties, due to financial constraints, the salaries of police officers have not been effectively increased, which may affect the progress of their work. Now that the general budget for local expenditures for the 26th year is being prepared, the salaries of local police officers in all provinces and counties should be increased as much as possible, taking into account the actual situation in each locality, so that they can serve with peace of mind. At the same time, it is hoped that more funds will be raised in order to prepare for performance evaluations, promotions, and salary increases, and it is determined to implement this starting in the 26th year, so as to improve the quality of the police and facilitate the progress of their work. The ministry has recently consulted the provincial and municipal governments for review and requested a report on the handling situation. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>

<h3>Necessary Conditions for Promoting Construction Projects</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Since the national crisis has deepened, the country has been in turmoil. People in the government alone have been able to maintain their composure and work diligently. The most remarkable achievement is construction. They have been able to plan comprehensively and promote projects in parallel. For example, the rapid completion of highways in various provinces, the continued construction of unfinished railways, the sudden emergence of grand buildings, and the sequential connection of transportation. All of these demonstrate the ruling authorities' dedication to governance and the technical personnel's diligent service, resulting in such remarkable and polished achievements. Among all the facilities, the most eye-catching is the promotion of the Qiantang River Bridge project, which is a solid proof of the grand development of construction projects. This project is difficult and extraordinary, unlike ordinary projects. In terms of its importance, it can be called the crown of the southeast. There has been no shortage of proposals in the past, but they were afraid of implementation and only became empty promises. Until this decision was made to organize it, many short-sighted people said that the situation was restrictive and that it might not be possible. Even after the construction began, it progressed smoothly. However, those who were good at spreading pessimism were still deeply suspicious, believing that completion was impossible. This shows that the matter was not easy to handle. Yesterday, Mao Yisheng, who presided over the project, clearly told people that all the bridge piers could be completed by the end of June, and the completion ceremony would be held on Double Ten Festival. At the same time, it was learned that the direct traffic between Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Ningbo and the joint transportation of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Guangdong three lines would all be completed on that day. With such a grand plan, one can see its completion in a fixed time. It not only spreads the reputation of the project itself, but also benefits the local people. What it shows to the world is to build a stable foundation for the political situation and give the public a good impression. Those who used to doubt the government's affairs and liked to be circuitous and frustrating may now be able to refresh their eyes and change their views. It is a move that has multiple meanings. All those who care about national affairs cannot help but be excited and encouraged when they hear the news of the imminent completion of this bridge.</p>
<p>I have always believed that there are necessary conditions for promoting all construction projects: fixed funding, selecting talent, balanced development, and strict control. Funding is the first step in all measures and the master of promoting the project. Once it is designated, it should be carefully kept and never be misappropriated, so as not to hinder the original purpose. The selection of talent is very difficult. Not only should knowledge and ability be considered, but also the person's private morality and character must be carefully noted. They must have the determination to be responsible and no intention to be obscured. Then, the progress will be faster. As for one thing to be done, it cannot be done by one person. It is necessary to divide the work and cooperate. Without the authority to control clearly, there will be a lot of blame and push. Only the faithful are discouraged, and the cunning are happy. The host must be equipped with Zhou Za to make balanced development. If the management aspect seems unimportant, it is actually closely related. The general project can be completed according to the type, and the predetermined deadline may not be different. However, whether the actual work is in full compliance and whether the materials used meet the requirements, it is difficult to suspend and obtain without personal experience. If the following can do things to be able to change the rate of Mengfu, and on the lack of strict knowledge of discrimination, then the results of stealing work and reducing materials, some future troubles are unimaginable. Show the consistent essence and energy, and prevent the hidden worries of the future. It is the responsibility of the project manager that is not allowed to be relaxed. Touched by the chords, because of the general theory, it will promote the attention of the Qiantang River Bridge workers.</p>
<h3>Japanese Diplomatic Hub Adjusts Relations with China</h3>
<p>Seeking Fundamental Solutions to All Problems　Maintaining Close Liaison between the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs　Summoning Kawagoe Back to Consult Soon</p>
<p>[Tokyo] When Japanese Foreign Minister Sato visited the Ise Grand Shrine, many journalists accompanied him. Therefore, this morning, various newspapers here published lengthy reports describing the policies that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to follow in the future. It is generally believed that this was Foreign Minister Sato's informal conversation with reporters in the car. The following is a summary of the main points: According to the views of the new diplomatic authorities, the fundamental solution to the Sino-Japanese problem is the hub of Japan's future diplomacy. The success or failure of adjusting relations with China will not only have a serious impact on Japan's relations with the Soviet Union, but also on the United Kingdom and the United States. As for the so-called Pacific problem and disarmament problem, they are inseparable from the problem with China. If Sino-Japanese relations can be adjusted, the friction between Japan and other powers can be greatly reduced, and Japan's credibility can also be improved. Regarding the three-minister conference of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs adopted by the previous cabinet, it will continue to be held to study the basic policies toward China. This conference will be held at least once a week. Foreign Minister Sato will try to exchange opinions with Army Minister Sugiyama Gen and Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa on issues such as the United Kingdom, the United States, China, the promotion of the Japan-Germany Anti-Communist Pact, and disarmament and commerce. In addition, it is planned to convene meetings of the responsible persons of the three provinces of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs from time to time, with the Foreign Minister as the center, to draft concrete plans.</p>
<p>The newly appointed Chinese Foreign Minister has now taken office, giving Japan a good opportunity to change its diplomacy toward China. For this reason, it is planned to instruct Ambassador to China Kawagoe to return to the country to jointly review China policies with the three ministers of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs. As for the issues mentioned by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, such as the abolition of consular jurisdiction and unequal treaties, Japan, in view of past experience, will deal with them with a sympathetic attitude, but it must be based on the premise of the completeness of Chinese legislation. When reporters inquired about the above news, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that he could not confirm whether it was published by the Foreign Minister, but to his knowledge, many journalists did accompany the Foreign Minister on his weekend trip.

<h3>Japan's Huge Budget Plan Passed by the House of Representatives</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The General Assembly of the House of Representatives met at 1:00 PM. Because today was the date for the formal submission of the budget plan for the twelfth year of Showa, there were no empty seats in the auditorium, and there was almost no room to stand in the gallery. The members of the Cabinet, starting with Prime Minister Hayashi, were all present, showing a tense atmosphere. At 1:15 PM, Chairman Tomita announced the opening of the meeting, and the deliberations began immediately. First, the government submitted the following two proposals: ㊀ The general budget plan for the income and expenditure for the twelfth year of Showa, and the budget plan for the income and expenditure for various special accounts for the twelfth year of Showa. ㊁ Matters that should be borne by the national treasury outside the budget and that require the conclusion of a contract.</p>
<p>The chairman instructed Chairman Koyama to report on the process and results of the Budget Committee.</p>
<p>During the final discussion of the Budget General Assembly, Kanie Kanichiro of the Social Masses Party and Yutani Yoshinuma of the Toho Association advocated the return of the budget, but the outcome was the approval of the general budget plan with the accompanying resolution of the political, civil, and Showa parties.</p>
<p>The whole room burst into applause. After the report was completed, the discussion began immediately. First, Tetsuji Katayama (Social Masses Party), who advocated the return of the budget, took the stage and mentioned the following items:</p>
<p>㊀ The increase in military expenditure was acknowledged as inevitable. ㊁ The stability of the national life was neglected in favor of narrow national defense. ㊂ This budget originated from the financial capital's dominance. Due to the above three situations, he advocated the return of the budget and listed the arguments for detailed review. He believed that the essence of the Yuki finance was the industrial dominance of financial capital, and the amendment of the Bank of Japan Ordinance was a clear proof of this. There was no way to stabilize the national life except to break the profitable industries. From the above viewpoint, he advocated compiling this budget separately. Next, Masaken Katsuno of the Minseito Party took the stage and expressed his support, saying, "This budget is a modification of the legacy of the Baba finance. It is really unsatisfactory in terms of national policy. In view of the current internal and external situation, it is inevitable to support this case." He will give the following warnings here:</p>
<p>㊀ If this budget is implemented, there is a risk of a sudden increase in prices and disruption of the stability of people's lives. ㊁ The national burden has increased sharply, so it is most important to ensure that the national life does not experience a sudden shock. ㊂ Efforts should be made to avoid adverse effects on the digestion of huge military expenditures and the preparation of raw materials. Yoshinuma Yutani (Toho Association) said,</p>
<p>The Hayashi Cabinet has greatly distorted the broad sense of national defense and has narrowed it down to an acute angle. The key to national defense should be the comprehensive expansion of military preparations and national life, but the Hayashi Cabinet's policy has not taken this into account. He went on to say that he could not agree with the amendment of the budget at all. As for the regulation of commodity prices, etc., he advocated that it should be in accordance with the Toho Association's theory of rebuilding the national economy. He also said that the local allocation of less than 30 million yuan was inappropriate. Finally, he criticized the evils of political transactions, which he considered to be the enemy of parliamentary politics, and that it was the inferior political means adopted by the military.</p>
<p>Kiroku Okuchi took the stage, read the accompanying resolution, and elaborated on its purpose, expressing his support. Next, Sanjo Nakamura of the Minseito Party talked about his supporting views, saying that he should not be intoxicated with the theories of each person and make irresponsible remarks to oppose the budget, etc.</p>
<p>Shu Toyota (Showa) asked the government to pay attention to the increase in national defense spending and not to cause a limping economy, and also expressed his support.</p>
<p>Benkyo Shiio listed five or more items of the government's political program, saying that there was a lack of intention to realize them. Although we support this budget, we do not necessarily trust the government, so we still hope that the government will pay attention to future measures.</p>
<p>Tetsuya Nonaka (Kokudo Domei) read the National Alliance's wish conditions and also expressed his support.</p>
<p>At this point, the discussion was completed, and a vote was held. Those who agreed stood up. Except for the Social Masses Party and the Toho Association, all the members stood up and unanimously approved. Thus, the large budget of more than 2.81 billion yuan was approved by a majority. The meeting adjourned at about 7:00 PM. (Allied Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States Establish Agreements</h3>
<p>Abolition of Perpetual Leases</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Anglo-Japanese Agreement on the removal of British perpetual lease rights has been concluded. However, on the afternoon of the 7th, the government also announced that the Japan-US Agreement on the removal of American perpetual lease rights had also been concluded. (Allied Press, 7th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Special Committee of the Privy Council met this afternoon to review the articles on abolishing all perpetual lease rights of British Overseas Chinese residing in England and concluding an agreement with the United Kingdom to change to ordinary lease or possession of the land. Foreign Minister Sato attended the meeting to clarify the contents of the agreement and report on the process of negotiating this matter with the United Kingdom.

<h3>US-Philippines Conference</h3>
<p>Broad Scope of Discussions, Not Limited to Business</p>
<p>[Washington] Since Philippine President Quezon arrived in the United States, he has been busy with social engagements for a week. Today, he is taking a short rest to prepare for tomorrow's meeting with various government department committees to discuss Philippine affairs. Tomorrow, Senator Robinson will invite Quezon to lunch, which may also involve political matters, as senators have been paying close attention to Philippine issues recently. Furthermore, the sugar case is also under study in Congress. Democratic Senator King stated today that he supports granting the Philippines preferential treatment in tariffs, similar to Cuba. He also supports the Philippines' request to shorten the term of the autonomous government and achieve early independence. He believes that the current Philippine Independence Act cannot cope with the current environment, resulting in the United States having only obligations but no power, and that the act also hinders Filipinos from finding new markets. He fears that the outcome will inevitably lead to a chaotic situation. As Quezon expressed dissatisfaction with the current Independence Act yesterday, the scope of discussions at tomorrow's government department meeting may not be limited to business matters. The person in charge of handling US-Philippine relations this time is Under Secretary of State Sayre, who has handled reciprocal trade agreement negotiations many times and enjoys President Roosevelt's deep trust. However, whether the meeting will result in a solution that is handled by the government or requires legislative procedures remains a question. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>US Department of Commerce Releases Foreign Trade Report</h3>
<p>Both Imports and Exports to China and Japan Increased Last Year</p>
<p>[Washington] The Department of Commerce released a foreign trade report today, stating that in 1936, US exports to major Asian countries were higher than in 1935. Exports to Japan increased by 1%, but the amount of cotton shipped to Japan that year, although reaching 705,000,000 pounds, worth 88,000,000 yuan, decreased by 101,000,000 yuan compared to the previous year. Exports to China increased by 25%, with tobacco, oil, iron, and steel products accounting for the majority, but cotton and automobile sales did not exceed those of the previous year. Exports to the Philippines increased by 15%, with all goods showing increases, and food increasing the most. Imports from Japan increased by 12% last year, with hog bristles, vegetable oil, textiles, various manufactured goods, chemicals, and toys accounting for the majority. Imports from China increased by 16%, with hides, hog bristles, and tung oil all increasing, while tin decreased. Imports from the Philippines increased by 2%, with sugar being the largest category, but coconuts and lard were lower than before. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Factory Strike Wave Expands</h3>
<p>Expansion of Military Program Affected</p>
<p>[London] Several aircraft factories in the country that manufacture government orders have recently experienced labor unrest, with the number of striking workers increasing daily. As a result, the government's expansion of the air force program may be affected and hindered. Currently, the number of striking workers has reached 6,000, with 4,000 belonging to Rolls-Royce and 2,000 being workers at the Fairey factory. Since the start of the government's military expansion program, aircraft factory workers have expressed dissatisfaction with their working conditions and treatment, which are inferior to those of other specialized mechanical workers. They also believe that since the government has issued large numbers of orders and the factories' business is booming, they are demanding wage increases. Therefore, local strikes have already occurred, and recently, the labor unrest has intensified. Union leaders are scheduled to hold several meetings next week. As for the government, it may convene a meeting of union representatives to resolve this issue, which is also possible. (7th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Ten Thousand Italian Volunteer Troops Arrive in Spain</h3>
<p>German and Russian Military Supplies Arrive Uninterrupted; Violations of Agreements Occur Frequently</p>
<p>[Paris] Various newspapers recently commented on the Spanish Civil War, all stating that a certain country's violations of the non-intervention agreement are occurring frequently. The right-wing newspaper L'Echo de Paris reported, "According to sources, after the international agreement on prohibiting the dispatch of volunteer troops to Spain, signed by the relevant countries, came into effect on the 20th of last month," a batch of Italian troops actually landed at the port of Cadiz in Spain (in the hands of the Nationalist forces) on the 28th of last month. This news is extremely serious and has been confirmed by the authorities of British Gibraltar. According to some sources, the total number of these troops reached 10,000, but other sources say that this number is not entirely reliable. The newspaper L'Action Française published an article by Madame Tabouis, confirming the news she obtained yesterday that 25,000 Italian army personnel are about to set off for Spain, and said, "Although the Italian authorities claim that these troops belong to those sent to the Italian colonies in East Africa, informed sources in Rome all assert that these troops, once formed, will be sent to Spain. In addition, according to news from the Italian port of Venice, a school has now been opened there, specializing in teaching tank driving methods." The well-known journalist Tau Dominic published an article in the newspaper La République, saying, "Italy is now sparing no effort to aid the Spanish Nationalist forces. If the Spanish Nationalist forces win, then the communication lines between France and its African territories will have no security." (8th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The diplomatic correspondent of The Manchester Guardian recently published a message stating that the international agreement on prohibiting volunteer troops from joining the Spanish Civil War came into effect on the 20th of last month, but was immediately violated, "because 10,000 Italian soldiers landed in Spain on the 28th of last month and joined the Spanish Nationalist forces." As for Germany and the Soviet Union, since the 20th of last month, no volunteer troops have arrived in Spain, but military supplies from these countries are still being transported into Spain uninterrupted, and have not stopped. In addition, Colonel Rossi of the Italian army (who previously led Italian troops to the Spanish island of Majorca in the Mediterranean) is reportedly still in Spain. Furthermore, the Spanish Nationalist forces have a large number of personnel and sophisticated weaponry, far superior to the government forces. Why have they not yet won a final victory? It seems that the combat capabilities of the German and Italian troops are not very sufficient, or General Franco is relying on his own strength to achieve victory and is unwilling to over-rely on the German and Italian troops. Therefore, he often does not allow them to participate in important military decisions or even in the war. (8th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Plenary Session of the Adjustment Committee</h3>
<p>Discussing the Surveillance Plan</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Committee decided yesterday after a ten-hour meeting that March 13th would be the final date for implementing the surveillance plan to stop military equipment and volunteers from entering Spain. At 11:00 a.m. tomorrow, the Non-Intervention Committee will hold a plenary session to finally approve this resolution, and will then consider the detailed report of the Surveillance Plan Subcommittee. This report, approved yesterday, advocates organizing an international office to handle the surveillance plan on behalf of the 27 countries participating in the Non-Intervention Committee. The main point that has not yet been resolved is France's share of 16% of the total implementation cost, amounting to 143,000 pounds in British currency. The German government has so far only agreed to pay 2,000 pounds in foreign currency, with the remainder paid in German marks. Lord Plymouth, chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee, declared yesterday that Germany's refusal has jeopardized the entire surveillance plan, because Britain and other countries must have the relevant major powers pay in convertible currency before they are willing to pay their share. The Portuguese government has withdrawn its objection to Soviet ships carrying surveillance personnel to Lisbon. (7th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Army Attacks Madrid</h3>
<p>Advancing in Three Columns; A Major Battle Is Imminent</p>
<p>⊙ Seberna: The Nationalist forces have been preparing to launch a major attack on the capital south of Madrid for many days. Now that the concentration of troops has been completed, they have begun to launch the attack. According to news from Andujar, the Nationalist forces have advanced north of Cordoba in the Bosan Blanco district. Their purpose is obviously the mercury mines of Puerdollano and Almaden. It is believed that there are currently three columns of Nationalist forces advancing towards the trenches held by the government forces. The central column, the strongest in force, is approaching. A major battle is imminent. (8th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid: Our correspondent Laurent reports that the government forces launched several consecutive offensives in the Jarama River area southeast of the capital in the middle of last week, all of which were successful. As a result, the highway from the capital to Valencia is no longer controlled by Nationalist forces' artillery fire. The government forces were most successful in the Pingleon area. The terrain there is rugged and the ravines are connected, but the government forces were still able to advance five kilometers and occupy the strategically important highlands near the railway line. Although the Nationalist forces used artillery and aircraft to bombard fiercely, the government forces had built solid shelters and were therefore unharmed. At this time, the Nationalist forces are concentrating fresh troops in the capital area, reportedly mostly German soldiers. It is expected that they will launch a major offensive on the capital in a matter of days, but due to a lack of gasoline and the concentration point being quite far from the base, the supply of military supplies is quite difficult. In addition, in order to avoid interception by government forces, they often take roundabout routes, so the march is extremely slow. (7th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid: The Defense Committee issued a war report stating that the Nationalist forces launched night attacks in the university district in the western suburbs of the capital and the El Bato town in the northwestern suburbs last night, twice, but were repelled by the government forces. In addition, a bridge built by the Nationalist forces on the Manzanares River was also blown up by the government forces. (7th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Army Detains Foreign Ships</h3>
<p>⊙ Gibraltar: The American ship "Springway No. 1" en route to a Spanish port was blocked in the strait by a Spanish Nationalist fishing boat and ordered to sail to Ceuta. The captain refused to comply and sailed quickly to Gibraltar. It is reported that Nationalist warships are now detaining foreign ships every day, mostly from Denmark and Norway, and escorting them to Ceuta, forcing them to unload their cargo before releasing them. At the same time, Moroccan reinforcements are still arriving in Algeciras from Ceuta in an endless stream, with two batches arriving every day. These troops are scheduled to go to the Malaga front line. According to informed sources in the Nationalist forces, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, General Franco, considers the concentrated troops to be insufficient to attack Almeria. It is reported that the government forces have increased heavy support there. (8th Reuter's telegram from the Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Bombing Incident Occurs on the French-Spanish Border</h3>
<p>Suspected to be the Work of Anarchists</p>
<p>⊙ Seber: French border inspectors were checking the passports of passengers on a special train from Paris to Spain today when a bomb suddenly exploded, destroying a carriage. Fortunately, all fifteen passengers were unharmed, but one passenger named Sells disappeared after the bombing. He was later arrested in Perpignan and anarchist documents were found on him, but he vehemently denied any involvement in the bombing. The police have two views on this case: (1) The bomb was intended to protest the Non-Intervention Committee's blockade of the French-Spanish border; (2) The incident was carried out by the Spanish Nationalist forces in order to block traffic between the government forces and France.

<h3>British Naval Exercises in the Western Mediterranean</h3>

<h3>Raw Materials Conference</h3>
<p>Opened in Geneva Yesterday; No Representatives from Italy or Germany Attended</p>
<p>[Geneva]</p>
<p>As a result of recent speeches by British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, Britain initiated a conference in London to formally study the issue of equal commercial opportunities for all countries in certain raw materials. This conference opened today, with representatives from sixteen countries attending. Sooner or later, it will involve political and economic events. Although Japan, a non-League of Nations member, also has representatives attending, neither Germany nor Italy has sent representatives. Germany has recently complained about its lack of raw materials. Now that a conference is being held to study the issue of raw materials, it is regrettable that no representatives are attending. A total of thirty-seven raw materials are to be considered, of which thirty-two are mostly produced in the British Empire. The famous Swiss economist Stucki has been elected as chairman of the conference. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's chief economic advisor, will present Britain's views this afternoon. Then, representatives from countries in need of raw materials, such as Japan and Poland, will successively present their views. This conference will probably last only a few days, after which representatives from several countries will draft a report on the various aspects of the raw materials issue and submit it to the next meeting, which is scheduled to be convened in about three months.

<h3>Anniversary of German Troops Entering the Rhineland</h3>
<p>Tearing Up the Treaty of Locarno; Explanation of Reasons</p>
<p>[Berlin] Last year on March 7, Hitler announced in the Reichstag the abolition of the Treaty of Locarno and the restoration of German sovereignty in the demilitarized zone along the Rhine River. German troops entered the area on the same day, and a year has passed since then. Garrison troops in various areas of the region held banquets yesterday to celebrate. The local newspapers, under the instruction of the authorities, also published lengthy articles explaining the reasons for abolishing the Treaty of Locarno. They also explained that the German people were uneasy because other European countries were all rearming, so they made many explanations to try to dispel this psychological state. Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave speeches yesterday in Berlin, Hamburg, and Cologne, saying that Germany is now strong enough that no country would dare to attack it. Lieutenant General Yastrow of the General Staff also published an article in a military magazine, stating that the German army's combat capabilities are now increasing daily, and that the defensive fortifications in the Rhineland demilitarized zone are now under construction. He also said that the main reason for Germany's rearmament was the signing of the mutual assistance pact between France and the Soviet Union, which was an obstacle to the establishment of a new Treaty of Locarno.

<p>⊙ Budapest: MP McKay, a member of the Royalist Party, recently issued a statement saying, "If the Austrian Habsburg royal family wants to implement a restoration, then Hungary should take the lead, because if Hungary implements a restoration, Germany cannot object, and Austria can then follow suit." McKay also said that there are no insurmountable obstacles to the restoration in Hungary, and the majority of the Hungarian people are in favor of it. As for the Little Entente countries, although their opposition to the restoration in principle is very firm on the surface, it is not as strong as it seems in reality.

<h3>New Island Discovered in the Black Sea</h3>
<p>▲ TASS News Agency, Siferopol, February 8th: A new island has been discovered in the Black Sea not far from the southwest coast of Crimea. It is 250 meters long, 30 meters wide, and rises 5.5 meters above sea level. A group from the Soviet Academy of Sciences investigation team has confirmed the appearance of the island and determined the cause of its formation. It is said that a very large rock from the high coastline in that area, which had been eroded by underground currents for a long time, collapsed into the sea. The impact force during the collapse was extremely strong, causing the seabed to be compressed into wave-shaped wrinkles. The island is one of these wrinkles.</p>

<h3>Revising the Usage Fee Rates for the Gaoyou Ship Lock</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance previously considered that the Gaoyou ship lock is located on the west bank of the Grand Canal and is mostly used by farmers to transport agricultural products, so the fee rate for using the lock was extremely low, only one-tenth of that of the Huaiyin ship lock, and empty ships were even exempted from tax. It is now found that many empty ships returning to Henan and Anhui provinces detour through the lock to avoid paying taxes. In order to eliminate this abuse, the collection fee rate for the lock has been revised and has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. (8th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Restricts the Power of Broadcasting Stations</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Communications has recently noted that the power of broadcasting stations established in various provinces often exceeds 1 kilowatt. This not only wastes funds but also causes interference. If this is not restricted, the power of provincial radio stations across the country will inevitably increase further, making it more difficult to allocate frequencies in the future and hindering the development of the broadcasting industry. To address this, the Ministry has specifically stipulated that the power of newly established or expanded radio stations in various provinces shall be limited to 1 kilowatt. This measure has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and has been circulated by the Executive Yuan to various provinces for compliance. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Convened a Meeting to Resolve the Case of Hunan Province Encroaching on Dongting Lake</h3>
<p>Representatives of Various Counties in Hubei Province Elected a Petition Delegation</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Regarding the case of Hunan Province encroaching on Dongting Lake to build Tianhu Embankment and proposing to block the four openings of the Yangtze River—Ouchi, Tiaoxian, Songzi, and Taiping—the people of Hubei Province have expressed their opposition. However, those who are determined to encroach are still rushing to build the embankment, which is about 100 miles long and covers a very large area. More than 10,000 workers are building it every day. The base of the embankment has been completed, with a height of more than one meter. At the same time, the surveying of Taiping, Ouchi, and Tiaoxian openings has been completed, and the surveying of Songzi opening is underway. The Executive Yuan has recently issued a strict order to the Hunan Provincial Government to temporarily suspend the construction to avoid escalating disputes, and has scheduled a joint meeting to be held in Nanjing on the 19th of this month, with representatives from the Ministries of Interior, Finance, and Industry, the governments of Hunan and Hubei Provinces, and the National Economic Council, to discuss a proper solution. The Hubei Provincial Government has sent Fan Xiji, a member of the Provincial Committee, to attend. The construction of Tianhu Embankment and the blocking of the four openings of the Yangtze River will cause the Yangtze River to change its course, Dongting Lake to move north, and the Xiang and Jiang Rivers to merge. This concerns the entire water conservancy of the Yangtze River basin and is not merely a dispute between the interests of Hunan and Hubei, so it must be handled with caution. Representatives of the fellow-provincial associations of various counties in Hubei Province held a delegation meeting at Jingnan Middle School in Wuchang at 1 PM on the afternoon of the 7th. The meeting was chaired by Shen Zhaonian and resolved several issues: ① To establish the Joint Association of Fellow-Provincial Associations of Various Counties in Hubei Province, with the office located within the Provincial Party Headquarters. ② To elect Yang Jinyu, Yu Qingzhi, Zhang Nanxian, Kong Geng, Fang Benren, Xie Shengkan, Tian Juyuan, Chuan Xiangrong, Chang Chunyuan, Li Shucheng, Zhang Xiaoxu, Zhou Xialing, Li Boren, Su Daoheng, Shen Zhaonian, Chen Dongshan, Chen Laibo, Zeng Shangwu, Liang Ruitang, Deng Tiehan, and Chen Demou, a total of 21 people, to form a delegation. The delegation is scheduled to go to the Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau on the 11th to petition, and Xie Shengkan, Chuan Xiangrong, Tian Juyuan, Su Daoheng, and Chang Chunyuan were tasked with drafting the petition telegram. ③ To organize the Hubei Water Conservancy Association, with the representatives of the delegation serving as organizers. ④ To recommend Xu Guorui, Director of the Jingjiang Dike Construction Bureau, to visit the Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to explain the advantages and disadvantages. ⑤ The temporary expenses for the delegation's activities will be covered by voluntary donations from the representatives of various counties.

<h3>New Discoveries of Song and Yuan Porcelain and Song Bronze Mirrors in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>—This can be used to study the burial customs of Song and Yuan Dynasties in Shanxi (present-day Shandong)—</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The road protection police of the Shandong Provincial Automobile Road Administration, currently stationed in western Jinan City for training, recently discovered an ancient tomb while digging trenches near the drill ground for air defense exercises. They found porcelain, bronze mirrors, and other items. The team leader reported this to the Administration, and Liu Xizhong, the Director of the Administration, invited Wang Xiantang, the Director of the Provincial Library, to send personnel for appraisal. The appraisal results determined that the porcelain items were from the Song and Yuan Dynasties, and the bronze mirrors were from the Song Dynasty. They were funerary objects. The Administration prepared a letter and donated the items to the Library for display. The letter and the list of ancient items are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Automobile Road Administration's letter to the Library stated, "According to the report from Wang Fuzhen, the captain of the student brigade of the road protection police of this Administration, while digging trenches near the drill ground for air defense exercises, they unearthed a total of fourteen items, including large and small jars and bronze mirrors. The Shandong Provincial Library was invited to send personnel for appraisal, and it was confirmed that they were ancient artifacts from the Song and Ming Dynasties. A list of the items and how they should be handled is attached for your review. In view of the fact that the bottles and mirrors obtained by the team while digging air defense trenches have been identified by your Library as ancient artifacts from the Song and Ming Dynasties, and that they are related to the cultural heritage of this province, they should be properly preserved for posterity and for research purposes. Therefore, we are donating all fourteen of these ancient artifacts to your Library for display to assist in archaeological research. We hereby request that you accept them for safekeeping and that you provide us with a detailed list of the examination results." The Library replied, "We have received your letter, and we are grateful for your donation of fourteen porcelain jars and bronze mirrors. We have examined them all. Among the twelve pieces of porcelain, one small black porcelain jar is from the Song Dynasty, and the rest are Yuan Dynasty porcelain. One jar with blue and red glaze is a Yuan Dynasty product from Huaiqing Prefecture imitating Jun kiln. It is the most valuable among all the items. All of them are daily necessities, and since they were found in a tomb, they were used as funerary objects. The square mirror is also a Song Dynasty artifact, and the craftsmanship is exquisite. This can be used to study the burial customs of the Song and Yuan Dynasties in Shanxi, which is of great cultural significance. In recent years, due to the high price of ancient artifacts, people often keep them secret after they are discovered. After these ancient artifacts were unearthed, your Administration's road protection team immediately made them available for public appraisal, and Captain Wang Fuzhen submitted all the items to your Administration. This is a testament to your selfless dedication and commendable training and use of personnel. We are grateful for your kindness in allowing our Library to display them publicly, which is a blessing for the cultural heritage and a glory for the art community. We are extremely grateful for your generous gift. In addition to labeling and decorating them separately, we will display them immediately. We hereby express our sincere gratitude and request your inspection."</p>
<p>List of ancient items: one small black porcelain jar from the Song Dynasty, two black porcelain jars from the Yuan Dynasty, five white porcelain jars (unspecified), one white porcelain wine cup from the Yuan Dynasty, one white porcelain bowl from the Yuan Dynasty, one white porcelain black flower vase from the Yuan Dynasty, one black porcelain jar from the Yuan Dynasty, one Jun porcelain jar from the Yuan Dynasty, one square bronze mirror from the Song Dynasty.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Aquatic Products Experiment Field Sends Personnel to Investigate Nieshan Island in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Escorted by the Keqiang Warship - The results of the investigation are very satisfactory - It can be a good base for the fishing industry</p>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: Nieshan Island, which belongs to Xiangshan, Zhejiang Province, can be developed into a good base for the fishing industry. Previously, Chen Tongbai, director of the Zhejiang Provincial Aquatic Products Experiment Field, drafted an opinion letter and submitted it to the authorities for development. It is reported that the field needs to conduct on-site inspections in order to specify the operation plan. In addition, in order to ensure the safety of the investigators because the island has always been occupied by bandits, it was requested to send a warship for escort. A few days ago, the Maritime Public Security Bureau ordered the Keqiang warship to sail to Dinghai and carry technicians Lin Shuyan and Lin Maochun and others from the field. They departed to the island for a detailed investigation lasting about five days. It was learned yesterday that the technicians have returned. According to reports, the situation of this investigation is briefly stated as follows: "Although the island is barren, the quality is exceptionally fertile, and the surrounding area is an excellent fishing ground. It is only a five-hour voyage from Dinghai. In the future, if the bandits can be wiped out and tens of thousands of yuan are allocated for minor operations, fishermen can be widely gathered and it can become an excellent fishing base. The results of this investigation are quite satisfactory. A detailed report will be submitted to the Construction Department for review and approval after it is sorted out and a development plan is prepared."</p>

<p>The Changshu Pond Embankment outside the Daxi Gate of this county is of great importance to the farmland water conservancy in the first and eighth districts. However, it has been in disrepair for many years and is severely damaged. The first section was completed last year after raising funds for construction. The eighth section, which is about one kilometer long, was originally planned to be built by the end of last year, but construction could not start due to unforeseen circumstances. Now, the eighth district office has made preparations and decided to organize a labor service team from various villages to start construction immediately. It is expected to be completed by mid-April.</p>
<h3>Shi Liang and Others in Suzhou Permitted to Receive Visitors</h3>
<p>Lawyers Shi Liang, Shen Junru, and five others are detained at the Jiangsu Higher Court Detention Center pending investigation. Due to the importance of the case, visits were suspended. The Higher Procuratorate is about to complete the investigation procedures, which are expected to be completed within one month, and has allowed family members to visit.</p>
<h3>Changshu Requests Improvement of Teacher Treatment</h3>
<p>The county's education administrative meeting will open on the 13th of this month, and the education community is extremely concerned about it. In view of the fact that each school in the county is ordered to employ only one person per classroom, the teachers' lives and spirits are both painful. Once there are diseases and other matters, they must also force themselves to do their duties. In addition, various volumes and registers are accumulated, and they still worry that it is difficult to be clear even if they revise them day and night. Therefore, it is difficult to be comprehensive in teaching management, and there is no opportunity for self-improvement. In recent years, the low level of students has not been affected by this. In order to improve teacher treatment and increase educational efficiency, the county education association has specifically proposed to the conference to break the system of one person per classroom and change it to a system of three people in two grades. It is heard that there are sufficient educational expenses here, and there may be a possibility of reform.</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society Establishes Branch</h3>
<p>In addition to the privately established charitable organizations, there is only a Red Cross branch in this county. Recently, local people went to Shanghai to contact the general headquarters of the Red Swastika Society to request the establishment of a branch in Changshu. After investigation, it was deemed that the establishment of a branch was possible, but the contactors were not very credible, and another commissioner was sent to Changshu to contact gentry Pang Diancai, Qu Liangshi, and others, requesting them to sponsor it. Agreement has now been reached. The director of the relief center is looking for a suitable location and has identified the back palace of the Zhou Shen Temple as the association's location.</p>
<h3>Small Wheel Steamer in Wuxi Robbed by Bandits</h3>
<p>Qianzhou Town in the county's ninth district is a prosperous commercial market with a large number of travelers coming and going between urban and rural areas. The Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company has opened a special wheel steamer between Hujia Ferry and Qianzhou to facilitate intermodal transport, operating four times a day. At 6 PM on the afternoon of the 7th, the wheel steamer was carrying seven or eight male and female passengers when it suddenly encountered two bandits near Linzhuang Bridge. Each bandit was holding a Mauser pistol, ordering the ship to stop and prohibiting any outcry. They jumped onto the bow of the ship and carried out a large-scale search and robbery. None of the passengers were spared, and the losses amounted to more than 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Labor Service in Yangzhou to Begin</h3>
<p>The labor service group organized by the party, government, military, school, commercial, and other institutions and organizations in this county has decided on the scope of service and the date of mobilization after holding a meeting. It is now scheduled to hold a labor service formal ceremony at the public stadium at 9 AM on the morning of March 11th. Each group will bring its own service equipment, slogans, and paper flags. After the meeting, they will march in formation to the designated old city river location to begin work. It is heard that the service personnel rosters of various institutions have been sent to the Construction Bureau for compilation, totaling approximately 4,000 people. They have already purchased excavation tools and carrying baskets for the dredging of the city river.</p>
<h3>Bandits Rob Nunnery and Injure People</h3>
<p>At midnight on the 7th, more than 30 bandits suddenly came to the Jijia Hotel Shouzhen Nunnery in Xilai Township, Jiangdu Ninth District. They knocked on the door and claimed to be the "Hui Tianshun". (The abbess of the nunnery is about 50 years old.) They entered and went directly to Tianshun's bedroom, pulled out a pistol, and shouted to keep silent. After inquiring and learning that there were no guns in the village or the nunnery, they tied up Tianshun, tortured her, and poured kerosene on her, forcing her to confess the location of silver coins. Then, they poured oil and tortured a fellow nun, while rummaging through boxes and cabinets, cooking and eating their fill. At about 2 AM, they roared away. It is estimated that they robbed a 50-yuan wine ticket sent by the Jiang family from Shanghai, 5 yuan in current coins, a pair of silver bracelets, two bags of flour noodles, bedding, clothing, and other items, totaling more than 100 yuan. After dawn, neighbors of the nunnery learned that the nuns had been tortured and were seriously injured inside and out. They were carried into the city. Doctors from Tongren and Chengzhong hospitals examined them one after another. They all said that Tianshun's life was in danger. A cardiac stimulant was administered in the city. It was said that there would be no change in a day and night before treatment could begin. She was carried back to the nunnery, and Yuanjing was carried to the Baohui Nunnery in the old alley to receive treatment in the city. The district bureau was also notified to investigate and capture the bandits.</p>
<h3>Nantong Establishes a Native Cloth Improvement Association</h3>
<p>Due to the sluggish sales of native cloth in Tong County, Commissioner Ge has united with industrial, financial, and textile experts to establish a Native Cloth Improvement Association to design, guide, and assist the implementation agencies. The county magistrates of the six counties, Hong Sheng, Zhang Yuanyang, Chen Guiqing, Zhang Liying, Su Min, and Gu Hongxi, are ex officio members.

<h3>Bengbu Drug Rehabilitation Center to be Abolished Immediately</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government stated that the two-year period for drug prohibition has expired. All those arrested for drug use this year should be immediately sent to the military judicial organs for trial and punishment in accordance with the regulations on prohibiting confidential crimes. They should not be re-admitted for rehabilitation. It has specifically ordered that the drug rehabilitation institutions that were previously expanded and consolidated be abolished immediately. Upon receiving the clear order, the police station here has abolished the drug rehabilitation center established the previous year and stopped accepting new patients in order to emphasize the law.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan Porters Gather for Armed Fight</h3>
<p>Linpu in Xiaoshan is a large town connecting Jinqu in the north and Ning Shao in the south, where goods are collected and merchants gather. The number of porters at the cargo terminal is as many as thousands. It is common to hear of disputes over shoulder carrying for their livelihood. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 3rd of this month, Jin Renquan, a porter from Yaho Wang Village, and Kong Youquan from Ziyou Village had a verbal dispute and then started fighting. Because the porters from the two villages had deep-seated grievances, the number of people on both sides was large and the fight became more and more intense. After the Public Security Bureau learned about it, it sent police to suppress it before it could be dispersed. As a result, two people from Ziyou Village and six people from Dai Shang Wang were injured, fortunately without serious harm. The ringleaders, Kong Youquan and Jin Renquan, were arrested and interrogated. On the afternoon of the 4th, the villagers of Dai Shang Wang prepared for an armed fight. Gentry from the town came forward to mediate, but because the conditions of both parties were difficult to accept, it was impossible to persuade them for a while. Hundreds of armed men from both sides, carrying guns and forming teams, went to the armed fight. Gunshots rumbled continuously. The Public Security Bureau sent a large team of police to suppress them. The director of Wang personally led the team to stop them before he could listen to persuasion. The person in charge mediated, and it is unknown whether the armed fight can be settled.</p>
<h3>Wen Zhou, Xu Hongbao inspects AGAIN</h3>
<p>Xu Hongbao, the customs supervisor of Wenzhou and Ouhai, set off for a real inspection of the coastal area of ​​the customs area in December of the 24th year of the Republic of China, and successively formulated plans based on the inspections and submitted them to the Ministry for adoption. Since the trip, the tax revenue has increased exceptionally, several times more than before. It is heard that Customs Supervisor Xu Lan had just returned for more than a year since his last tour. Although the investigation network is tight, private sales activities are inevitable. In addition, the bandits in Pingyang and Taishun have been rampant recently, and it is feared that there will be private transport by Chinese traitors. It is also heard that large-scale smuggling companies have been re-established in various parts of South China, and there are even concerns that they will have a large number of smuggled goods. If there is an invasion of the customs area, and the coastal area is smuggling, it is inevitable that the situation will change recently, circumventing tax avoidance. Xu Hongbao followed the consistent proposition of Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance to rectify tariffs and strictly suppress smuggling, and specially invited customs affairs officer Morgan to tour again. I also heard that in addition to setting off for the coastal area of ​​the customs area, as well as the islands and ports, for detailed inspections, he also went to Gu'aotou and Haimen two sub-cards to inspect them separately. Based on the results of this inspection, he planned to reorganize the anti-smuggling case.</p>
<h3>Lu Province Confiscated Three Cars Carrying Illicit Goods</h3>
<p>—All Illicit Goods Were Also Detained—</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the smuggling of illicit goods has had a profound and significant impact on national revenue, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Han Fuqu, has repeatedly received orders from the central government to instruct his subordinates to strictly investigate and suppress illicit goods in order to rectify tax revenues and safeguard the national economy. He has already seized illicit goods several times and confiscated them. Recently, according to a telegram from the Fifth District Inspector's Office of Huimin, three cars transporting illicit goods were seized. The cars were transporting smuggled cigarettes and paper. They were sent to the headquarters for investigation. Han considered the matter to be of great importance. In addition to confiscating all illicit goods according to law as a warning, he also issued a public notice to inform merchants and civilians. The public notice stated, "The payment of taxes on transported goods is specifically stipulated by law. Evasion and trickery are not permitted by law. In recent times, smuggling has become increasingly prevalent, which has had a profound and significant impact on the state's revenue and the loss of rights. I, the Chief Commander, am duty-bound to be vigilant and cannot but suppress it. I have repeatedly issued orders to my subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit it, and to take measures to prevent it. According to a telegram from the Fifth District Inspector's Office of Huimin, three cars transporting illicit goods were seized at Yangfang Ferry in that county. The cars were detained and sent for investigation. In addition to confiscating them according to law, this notice is hereby issued to inform all merchants and civilians. In the future, when transporting goods, you must comply with the regulations and pay taxes, and you are not allowed to evade or smuggle goods. If you dare to violate this, you will be severely punished and never leniently treated. This is a must."</p>

Its magnificent scale and perfect facilities are unparalleled in the Far East. Those in charge are leading figures in the sports and business communities. The construction site has been selected between Baker Road and Maybach Road. The plan was announced yesterday by the board of directors of the venue and named "Olympia" Sports Field. Construction will begin soon. The purpose is purely to inspire great sports endeavors and meet the needs of the public. This grand project has been in commercial planning for years and was completed after much careful consideration, representing a new social undertaking. It is now sponsored by the U.S. Commercial Counselor's Office in Shanghai and organized a board of directors in accordance with company law. Mr. Wang Zhengting, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States and former Chairman of the China National Amateur Athletic Federation, is also listed as one of the patrons.</p>
<p>Board of Directors Established</p>

<p>Total Investment of Two Million Yuan</p>
<p>The total investment of the company is estimated at two million yuan in national currency, with one million yuan intended for construction and various equipment expenses, and the remaining one million yuan for purchasing real estate and meeting the needs of working capital. The entire base covers a total of eleven acres and will house a magnificent and grand building. The building is divided into three floors, with extremely complete sports facilities, from ice hockey to new-style billiards rooms and Earthball fields, everything is available. The designer is the famous architect Mr. Dong Dayou. Mr. Dong has planned and built the large sports field and gymnasium in the city center and has a wealth of experience, so the design is innovative and perfect. The construction plan and drawings have been sent to the United States for review and correction by a number of well-known construction experts, and have now been approved by the board of directors, and construction will begin soon.</p>

The surrounding stands can accommodate 7,000 spectators. The design of this pool serving two purposes is entirely to introduce ice hockey to the people of Shanghai. This kind of reasonable team sport that develops all the muscles simultaneously is of great promotional value. Therefore, in addition to installing this novel device, the venue will also hire experts to guide and train beginners in the technical essentials at any time, hoping that ice hockey will become as popular in Shanghai as football and basketball and become a popular sport.</p>

The general manager in charge of this great sports undertaking is Mr. Fischer, the general manager of the Elysée. Mr. Fischer is very familiar with the sports situation in this city and is particularly close to Chinese and Western sports organizations. The staff of each department are now being assessed and employed by Fischer based on their abilities, and will be announced in full soon.</p>

<h3>Mutual Accusation Case Between Hubei Education Director and Teacher Adjudicated by Wuchang District Court</h3>
<p>Teacher Zhang Found Guilty of Insult, Fined; Counter-Accusation of Director Zhou Found Not Guilty on All Counts</p>
<p>(Hankou Airlines News) Zhongxiang Middle School teacher Zhang Chuandao, because of the new Education Director Zhou Tianfang was not seen. There were words insulting Mr. Zhou's dignity, and Zhou ordered the guards to hand them over to the Provincial Police Department and send them to the Wuchang Local Court to accuse Zhang of insulting his superiors, destroying public property, and obstructing official duties. Zhang also hired three lawyers, including Wang Guangxiang, to file a lawsuit accusing Zhou of abusing his power, illegally arresting, and falsely accusing him. On the 17th of last month, the court held a hearing and ordered the end of the debate, scheduled to pronounce the verdict on the 1st of this month. The date was later extended to 1:00 p.m. on the 5th before the verdict was pronounced. The main text was that Zhang Chuandao insulted his superiors and damaged public property, which constituted crimes under Articles 124 and 382 of the Criminal Law. He was sentenced to a fine. Zhang Chuandao's accusation of Zhou Tianfang was found not guilty. The uproar that swept through Wuhan has now calmed down. After the verdict in this case, Zhou issued a statement stating his feelings: "I was ordered to come to Hubei to handle education. All facilities are based on local conditions and in accordance with central laws and regulations. I am cautious in handling matters. In terms of personnel, I follow Taigong's example and have never had any selfish intentions. This time, Zhongxiang Middle School teacher Zhang Chuandao came to the hall to cause trouble. The accusation of slander against me was purely due to a failure to understand my spirit. At that time, the court was in the process of trial, and although reporters came to visit, I did not express any opinions. Now that the court has pronounced its verdict and the truth is revealed, there is no need to express any opinions. However, I feel sorry that I have not been in Hubei for long and my credibility has not been established, which has caused this unfortunate incident of colleagues in the education community misunderstanding me and violating criminal law. (8th) (Hankou, 8th) Zhang appealed to the High Court in the case of Zhang's accusation against the Director of Education.</p>

<h3>Zhang Boling Gave a Lecture at Jinling University Yesterday</h3>

The general idea was that today the country is unified, and all kinds of construction are thriving.

The reason why the country is not strong today is not because the nation's wisdom and morality are inferior to others, but because of a "selfish" character.</p>

<h3>Xiqing Volleyball Yesterday's Match: Haiqing Wins Over Suqiaoer</h3>
<p>In the Xiqing volleyball matches yesterday, there were two games in Group A. Haiqing met the undefeated Suqiaoer team. Due to their superior strength, Haiqing easily coped with the match, and Suqiaoer already felt overwhelmed. In the first game, the result was 15 to 5, with Haiqing winning. In the second game, Suqiaoer tried hard to rally and recover their previous loss, but they were unable to do so despite gaining a slight advantage. In the end, the score was 15 to 10, with Suqiaoer losing consecutively. The overall score was 2 to 0, with Haiqing winning completely. The other match was between Xiqing and the Russian army. In the previous round, the Russian army had suffered a complete defeat against Xiqing. In yesterday's match, they recalled their previous shame and launched a fierce attack. However, they were brave but lacked strategy. Their cannonball-style spikes were ineffective, while Xiqing's light touches and skillful kills were extremely cunning, allowing them to easily outmaneuver their opponents. Xiang Boluo Kefu's fierce spikes were also turned against his own side, forgetting his former deep feelings. The Russian army was even more miserable under these circumstances. Therefore, after losing the first game 10 to 15, they still failed to capitalize on many opportunities in the second game and lost 13 to 15. The overall score was still 2 to 0, with Xiqing defeating them again. In the match between Xiqing and Suqiaoer the night before, Xiqing also won with two straight sets. The results are recorded below. The lineups of both sides were the same as before, so there is no need to repeat them.</p>

<h3>The City Women's Association Celebrated "March 8th" Yesterday</h3>
<p>A commemorative meeting was held in the morning with representatives from all walks of life, along with radio broadcasts and speeches, and promotion in rural areas.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency reports that yesterday was "March 8th," International Women's Day. In addition to issuing a letter to women to encourage them, the city's Women's Association held a commemorative meeting at 10:00 AM at the auditorium of Huadong Girls' High School on Xiafei Road, with over 600 representatives from all walks of life attending. Prominent figures were invited to broadcast on the radio, and personnel were sent to rural areas to promote the cause. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Meeting Staff</p>
<p>The meeting staff included: Presidium: Lin Kecong, Zhang Sujun, Luo Gengyang, Shu Huizhen, Wang Jisi; Recorder: Lin Yuxiang; Master of Ceremonies: Miao Lianqing; Reception: Yao Shicui, Weng Huiyao, etc.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After performing the ceremonial rituals, Chairman Lin Kecong gave a report, stating that since 1909, when American women launched a movement for liberation on March 8th, women in various countries have gradually begun to liberate themselves. In China, after this trend spread to East Asia, Chinese women have also become aware of the various oppressions and sufferings they have suffered. Since the National Revolutionary Army took its oath in the 15th year of the Republic of China, the government has also been able to respond to the demands of women and has successively formulated many laws to improve the status of women. Although the majority of women are still trapped under the constraints and oppressions of feudal patriarchal forces and the lack of guaranteed livelihood due to backward production, it cannot be denied that considerable gains have been made in terms of politics and law. Therefore, our future women's movement should do more positive and practical work. Especially now that the national crisis is severe, our female compatriots should all strive to rise up and work for resistance and national salvation under the leadership of the government. I believe that the women's problem in China cannot be completely resolved until the entire China obtains freedom and equality. I hope everyone will unite and work together, etc.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches</p>
<p>Subsequently, Ma Jiazhen, the principal of Huadong Girls' High School, gave a speech, stating that: (1) In the past, women generally believed that they were oppressed by men and had to resist men everywhere. But now, the oppression women suffer is the same as the oppression men suffer from imperialism and unequal treaties. Therefore, the first path for women's efforts in the future is to seek national freedom and national equality together with men, and to shoulder the responsibility of saving the country and resisting aggression. (2) At present, women have equal opportunities with men in terms of law, education, and politics. But in fact, because women are not as educated as men, women's ability to act in various fields is not as good as that of men. Therefore, the second path for women's efforts in the future is to promote the popularization of women's education and strive for self-cultivation in order to achieve truly equal status with men, etc. Then, Wang Tianren gave a speech, which can be roughly divided into three main points: (1) To commemorate Women's Day, women themselves should strive for women's economic rights. (2) To commemorate Women's Day, we should break away from vanity. (3) To commemorate Women's Day, we should prepare our own strength. The so-called strength can be divided into two types: human resources and material resources. Compared with the two, human resources are particularly important, and human resources are divided into physical strength, mental strength, and technical strength. I hope that female compatriots will make twelve points of effort in this regard, etc. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>Radio Broadcasts and Speeches</p>
<p>In addition to holding a commemorative meeting yesterday, Wu Mayor's wife, Cai Yuanpei's wife, Ms. Wang Xiaoying, Ms. Lu Lihua, and Ms. Shu Huizhen were specially invited to broadcast the meaning of "March 8th" on the Asia Sound, Great China, and other radio stations at 11:00 AM. Lin Kecong, the managing director of the association, and the directors, led the staff and members to the areas of Fanhuangdu, Xujiahui, Beixinjing, Longhua, Jiangwan, Wusong, etc. in the afternoon to explain the relationship between March 8th and society, the country, and the world.</p>

<h3>The National Goods Association Asked to Stop the Monopoly of Foreign Bulb Merchants</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Letter to the Shaoxing Chamber of Commerce Asked to Send Personnel to Investigate and Stop It</p>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association, in order to request the prohibition of the monopoly of foreign bulb companies in promoting sales in the Shaoxing market, sent a letter to the Shaoxing Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: Dear Sirs, Recently, we received a letter from our member, Huade Factory, stating that our factory recently learned that the Shaoxing Electrical Industry Association has signed a sales agreement with a certain foreign bulb company, and all the bulbs needed in the county are supplied by the company. We were shocked to hear this. We have investigated that the government is implementing the promotion of the use of national goods by the national people. If this agreement is signed, not only will our Chinese market be arbitrarily monopolized, but also the implementation will destroy our national goods and cut off sales channels. Our national goods bulb industry will be deeply affected. For the sake of national goods, we specially wrote to your association, and forwarded the letter to the Shaoxing County Chamber of Commerce, to investigate and stop the signing of this agreement, etc. In this regard, we have investigated that promoting national goods is one of the basic movements of our government, and it is extremely important to the survival of the entire country. In recent years, foreign insults have become more and more pressing, and the national steps have been difficult. At the time when smuggling is rampant and it is difficult to suppress bandits, it is felt that there is an urgent need for the entire country to uniformly use national goods. Moreover, the Executive Yuan issued the third (79) order to all agencies and local people on May 21, 1936, that national goods should be purchased as soon as possible in order to prevent leakage, etc. The order was sent for investigation and processing. Now, according to the factory's report, the Shaoxing Electrical Industry Association has actually taken this action, which not only violates the government's intention to promote national goods, but also destroys national goods and introduces wolves into the house. It is a severe step. It is appropriate to send a special letter to you, and we hope that your association will promptly send personnel to investigate and stop the signing of the agreement, so as to prevent the public from following suit, and to maintain the export of national goods and consolidate the patriotic front. We sincerely hope and pray for the best, and we will reply with a new perspective.</p>

<h3>Two Major Teams of the Red Swastika Society are Working in the Sui War Zone</h3>
<p>War Zone Crime Department Until May</p>
<p>When the Sui War was tense last year, various charitable organizations and youth associations in the city sent personnel to express their condolences. The World Red Swastika Society, hosted by Mr. Xiong Xipan, also allocated three major teams, carrying medicines to take on rescue work. The National Army's resistance to Japan has gained its help. Since the National Army's successive victories to this day, the front line has become quiet, and the representatives of various condolence groups have gradually returned to Shanghai. The reporters of the _Zizhou_ News Agency specially inquired from the Southeast Main Association of the Red Swastika Society. According to the talk, the association's rescue work for the Sui War has come to an end.

<p>National News Agency, Shanghai, 8th. Since the opening of the Shanghai-Tokyo line in June 1934, Sino-Japanese wireless telegraphs have been widely used and enjoyed by Chinese and foreign people due to their rapid and accurate communication.

<h3>Labor Strife Waves</h3>
<p>Antique Shop Workers Resumed Work Yesterday</p>

A mediation was convened yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM regarding treatment conditions. All workers and managers of the shops attended. Wang Zhu-sun, the person in charge from the bureau, was on leave, and Zhu Gui-lin acted as his replacement. After a lengthy discussion, all the conditions were agreed upon, except for the issue of working hours, where the workers insisted on eight hours per day. The employers agreed to reduce it to eleven hours, so a complete resolution was not reached. It is heard that the bureau has decided to schedule another mediation.</p>
<p>Luen Cheong Workers Petitioned Yesterday</p>
<p>Since a strike broke out among male and female workers in the coarse and fine yarn sections of the British-owned Luen Cheong Textile Printing and Dyeing Company in Lujiazui, Pudong, it has been many days. After the employers invited foremen and worker representatives from various departments to hold direct negotiations, the employers only agreed to increase wages by 5%. There was no adequate decision on other conditions such as bonuses and holidays. After the foremen and worker representatives reported the negotiation process to all the workers, it was rejected, and a solution was not reached. The labor unrest is still at a standstill. Yesterday morning, twelve representatives from various departments of the factory presented a petition first to the city party headquarters. Zhang Sheng, the chief director of the civil movement section, received them. The workers presented six demands: (1) Increase the daily wage of female yarn-joining workers by one dime, increase the wage of bobbin workers by one-quarter, and add one worker per bag; (2) No deductions of wages; (3) Female workers should be able to take leave automatically when pregnant, and receive six weeks of leave with pay at childbirth; (4) Male and female workers should not have their wages deducted for incidents occurring outside the factory; (5) After working for two weeks, workers should be compensated with one day off; (6) Workers should not be dismissed without cause. Mr. Zhang indicated acceptance and agreed to coordinate with the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. They then went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, where Section 3 staff member Zhang Chuqiang received them. They did not go to the General Labor Union to petition, but Commissioner Gong Yuting received them and agreed to find ways to mediate the workers' demands. It is understood that after receiving the workers' petition for assistance, representatives of the party and government authorities have discussed it and decided to cross the river to Pudong tomorrow to mediate with the factory.</p>
<p>Silk Factory Workers Gradually Approaching Agreement</p>
<p>More than 500 workers from silk factories such as Meifeng and Jinsheng on Linqing Road in East Shanghai have been on strike for more than ten days, and a resolution has not yet been reached. Labor and management have clashed in recent days. The night before, Meifeng factory contracting foremen Zhang Zhiquan, Shen Changfu, and Ni Peisheng led many people in a conflict with the striking workers. Ni Peisheng was seriously injured, and the wives of Zhang Zhiquan and Shen Changfu were also beaten. The constabulary is increasing patrols to maintain order. The striking workers originally planned a joint petition this morning, but because the factory asked someone to come forward to mediate, their opinions have gradually approached an agreement, so the petition was cancelled. According to worker representatives, the labor unrest may be resolved soon.</p>

<h3>Three Things the Industrial and Commercial Sectors Should Pay Attention to After the Implementation of Income Tax (Continued)</h3>
<p>Li Wenjie's Speech at the Citizen's Association; Important Reference for the Industrial and Commercial Sectors</p>
<p>(B) Matters to be Paid Attention to Regularly</p>
<p>The calculation of income tax for profit-making enterprises is based on the total actual and collectible revenue from business operations as the total revenue, from which the necessary and reasonable expenses and other losses, bad debts, depreciation, inventory consumption, public contributions, and legally prescribed public reserve funds (collectively referred to as deduction items) paid and payable but unpaid during the business period are deducted to obtain the net profit. Then, the ratio of the net profit to the actual capital amount (the actual capital received plus one-third of the statutory public reserve fund) is multiplied by the net profit to obtain the amount of income tax to be paid. The so-called total revenue, various deduction items, and actual capital amount are all items and figures expressed in accounting books and documents. Therefore, the detailed rules stipulate that the reporter of the income of profit-making enterprises should produce a property catalog, profit and loss statement, balance sheet, or other account books and documents sufficient to prove the amount of income when reporting. The person obligated to pay tax and report should pay attention to the following matters in accounting: how to properly preserve the documents that can prove the increase or decrease in property, and accurately record and regularly express the increase or decrease. To analyze it, special attention should be paid to the following points: (1) Accounting books, forms, documents, vouchers, etc. should be properly stored. In commercial institutions that cannot have iron cabinets, an account box should also be prepared, and important documents should be stored after work every day, so that they can be easily taken in the event of unexpected incidents. (2) The names of the managers and the start and end dates of management should be stated in the account book. (3) If there are any errors in the account table, the person handling the correction should affix a seal to prove it. Do not use knives to scrape or chemicals to erase the handwriting. (4) Payment of funds must be based on documents, and receipt of funds must be based on receipts. Transfer transactions must be based on separate vouchers before recording in the account. (5) In addition to the signature of the responsible accounting personnel to indicate that the accounts have been cleared, each accounting voucher must be signed and sealed by the responsible person at the higher level for certification. (6) The daily accounts should be recorded on the same day. After the accounts are cleared, a symbol should be added. (7) A trial balance should be performed at least at the end of each month to check whether the accounting is correct. (8) Incoming and outgoing letters must be numbered and recorded in a book. Letters of important nature must also retain the envelope and the mailing receipt. Outgoing documents must be retained as a copy. (9) Important seals should be carefully stored. The above are general matters that should be paid attention to. The following are the matters that should be paid attention to regarding income tax: (1) Do not forget to withhold income tax when paying interest on deposits and loans (excluding those whose lenders are money lenders) and personnel. If it is not paid to the collection agency for the time being, a separate "withheld income tax" account should be opened to record it. (2) Do not forget to withhold income tax when paying irregular commissions to people involved in business and when paying regular salaries and remuneration to people who are used in business. For each business user, a separate account must also be established to record the income tax for each month of the year, so as to calculate their average daily income for the whole year. (3) The income tax on interest on bank deposits and other loans has been withheld by the debtor. This is income tax that has been paid from business income and should be deducted from the income tax payable. Therefore, a separate subject should be established to record it, and the withholding list should be carefully preserved for proof. The same applies to income tax withheld from temporary profit income outside of this business. (4) If industrial and commercial institutions invest in real estate, it is best to separate this investment from the inherent business so that it can be calculated independently for profit and loss. (5) Special care should be taken with each item of the "Note on the First Category of Collection" draft item 12 that cannot be considered necessary and reasonable expenses and losses in business. The historical habit of treating capital official interest as an expense should be carefully noted. Before the current law is revised, it will not be listed as an expense to save the trouble of returning and correcting the calculation report. (6) When purchasing or building houses, land, machinery, tools, and property, documents proving the original price should be preserved. Expenses incurred for processing, improving, renovating, and repairing in the future should be added to the original price, and the documents should also be preserved together. This can avoid the danger of the competent collection agency directly assessing the value of the above-mentioned assets when it is impossible to produce reliable supporting documents. (7) Bad debts that have been recovered and included in the loss should be listed as income for the current year. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Check Found on the Road Wrongfully Cashed; Culprit Convicted</h3>
<p>Ham Shop Partner Lost Check and Was Planning to Report Loss; Immediately Reported to Police Upon Seeing Someone Trying to Cash It; Arrested and Taken to the Police Station</p>
<p>Qiu Jinguang, a Ningbo native residing at No. 11 Zhiqing Lane, Jessfield Road, West Shanghai, aged 23, went to the Nanshi Dalin Road to see his relatives yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM. He and his wife, Ms. Zheng (aged 21), went together. While passing through the Old North Gate in the city, Ms. Zheng suddenly found a check for</p>
<p>Two Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>on the ground with the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Nanshi Ximen Branch, Yin character number 2830. She handed it to her husband, Qiu. Upon inspection, Qiu saw that the check was due that day. A fortuitous heart arose, and he and his wife hurried to Ximen to wrongfully cash it at the bank. At that time, Hu Xueying, an Anhui native, aged 28, was a partner in the Hu Dasheng Ham Shop at 239 Fangbang Road in the city. Yesterday morning, he was ordered by the shop to take the check paid by the Danfenglou Rong Restaurant at the intersection of Ximen Zhonghua Road</p>
<p>Account for Ham</p>
<p>and cash it at the Shanghai Bank. Hu happened to have important business to attend to at a friend's place on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, so he discovered that the check was missing. He searched everywhere but could not find it and was extremely anxious. He hurried to the bank to report the loss when he caught sight of the check in the hands of the young couple, who were about to cash it. In a moment of desperation, he reported the situation to the bank's police officer Zhang Zijun. Officer Zhang apprehended Qiu</p>
<p>and his Wife</p>
<p>and brought them both to the Wemiao Road police station for interrogation. After the plaintiff, Hu Xueying, stated what happened, Qiu Jinguang and Qiu Zheng confessed that they found the check and wrongfully cashed it. Zhang Zhenxiang (aged 23), a partner at the Danfenglou Restaurant, Anhui native, confirmed that the check was indeed given by the shop to the Hu Dasheng Ham Shop. After verifying the confession, the police station believed that the case involved greed and embezzlement and immediately prepared a document to submit to the general bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>名妓適人後忽訴遺棄</h3>
<p>Result: Defendant Found Not Guilty; Incidental Civil Suit Rejected</p>
<p>Zhuang Dingxin, a 36-year-old Ningbo native and former senior employee of the Xingju Company at Sassoon House on Nanjing Road, met Hongying Laoba, a famous prostitute from Leyu Lane on Yunnan Road, while out carousing with friends two years ago. Laoba's real name was Lü Suzhen, a 22-year-old from Wuxi, Jiangsu, residing at No. 1 Fukang Lane, Dunji Lane, Nine Acres, Nanshi. After getting acquainted with Zhuang, they developed deep affection for each other, feeling as though they had met too late. Soon, Lü</p>
<p>Stopped taking engagements</p>
<p>And began living with Zhuang in a loving cohabitation. Alas, good times don't last forever, and a storm suddenly arose in their love boat, leading to an irreparable rift. Lü then hired lawyer Zhou Yongzhi to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Zhuang Dingxin of seduction, abandonment, and undermining public morals, along with an incidental civil suit. The reasons for the lawsuit stated that Lü Suzhen, using the stage name Hongying Laoba, had been taking engagements at brothels. In 1935, after meeting the defendant Zhuang Dingxin, they developed deep affection for each other. The defendant also claimed to be unmarried and</p>
<p>Decided to Marry Her</p>
<p>Making Lü leave the brothel on the Dragon Boat Festival of the same year and rent a house in Nanlin Lane on Haining Road to live together. All expenses were provided by the defendant. At that time, the plaintiff was already pregnant and had discussed formal marriage with the defendant. The defendant made many excuses, saying they'd notify his parents and hold the wedding after the birth. Until May 29th of last year, the defendant sent the plaintiff to</p>
<p>Tongde Maternity</p>
<p>Hospital, where she gave birth to a boy two days later, who died the same day. Unexpectedly, at this juncture, the defendant suddenly changed, becoming estranged. Not only did he not return home often, but he also neglected to provide for her livelihood, effectively abandoning her. After detailed investigation, the plaintiff discovered that the defendant had become infatuated with a dancer and built another love nest to live together. The plaintiff, as a woman of weak will, suffered</p>
<p>Initial Affection, Ultimate Abandonment</p>
<p>Which constituted a crime under Articles 129 and 293 of the Criminal Law. Besides requesting a legal sentence, she also filed an incidental civil suit, requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay monthly alimony of 50 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao presided over the case in the Third Criminal Court. The plaintiff, Lü Suzhen, arrived with her lawyer Zhou Yongzhi to state the above facts. When questioned, the defendant Zhuang Dingxin confessed that the plaintiff was</p>
<p>Introduced by a Teahouse Server</p>
<p>At the Wu Palace Hotel. They had relations. Afterwards, he would occasionally visit her residence in Nanlin Lane.

<h3>Girl Abandoned in a Small Inn</h3>
<p>Woman Disappears, Never to Return; Child Sent to Nursery</p>
<p>At the Dong Inn, a small inn located at No. 8 Xiafei Road in the French Concession, a modern middle-aged woman arrived at around 5 PM on the 5th of this month, carrying a female infant, just a month old. She requested to rent Room No. 3 to stay overnight. The baby was wrapped in a red foreign cloth swaddle. The woman claimed to be Chen, a local resident, 30 years old. After paying the room fee, she asked the tea server, Lu A'gen, if there were any nearby wet nurses for hire. Lu replied that there were none. The woman then put the baby on the bed, claiming she was going out to find a wet nurse, but never returned. Until the next day, the inn still didn't see Chen come back, and the baby cried incessantly in the room all night. So, the tea server took the baby to the Xiafei Police Station to report and requested arrangements. The head patrolman ordered the baby to be left temporarily and sent to Guangci Hospital for care. Yesterday, it was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, requesting a decision. First, police lawyer Chen Ming went through the procedure, and then the official questioned Lu A'gen, the tea server of the Huadong Inn, about what happened. Subsequently, Wang Liu, a woman residing in Jing'an Temple, claimed she wanted to adopt the baby because she was unable to conceive. As a result, because a guarantor could not be found, Judge Bai ruled that the nameless female infant should be sent to the nursery for care.</p>

<h3>Xu Zulin Accused of Negligence in Boiler Explosion Case</h3>
<p>Xu Claims to Have Been Too Tired From Repairing Pipes; Nephew Firing Boiler Caused Tragedy</p>
<p>The boiler at the Shanghai Bank at No. 50 Ningbo Road suddenly exploded on the morning of the 28th of last month, killing Zhu Fenglai and Pan Weihan, and injuring Xu Jiarui. Afterwards, after investigation by detective Gao Zhen under the order of the police station, it was recognized that Xu Zulin, the worker in charge of managing the boiler, was indeed negligent, so he was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for</p>
<p>Requesting Detention</p>
<p>The details have been described in detail in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened the First Criminal Court to continue the trial. Police lawyers Ru Bao Yi and Qian Xun Jiu filed a lawsuit according to Article 276, Section 2 of the Criminal Law for causing death due to negligence in business, and stated that the cause of the disaster was that the defendant hired a person without any experience to perform his duties, resulting in excessive heat and forgetting to open the valve, causing this disaster. After the incident, the police station</p>
<p>Commissioned Experts</p>
<p>Americans Davis and Meisheng to go for appraisal and prepared an appraisal report. This morning, the two appraisers were present in court, requesting questioning. Subsequently, Ma Xinchong, a clerk at the Shanghai Bank, stated that the defendant had been working as a fireman in the bank for more than five years. It was stipulated that he should start the fire at 5 AM every day and extinguish the fire at 12 PM in the afternoon. A few days before the accident, the defendant reported that there was a</p>
<p>Pipe Leaking</p>
<p>I then ordered an engineer to go and check, believing that the leak was irrelevant. As for why the disaster occurred this time, I don’t know. Next, Davis testified that after the accident, he went to investigate and found that the explosion was indeed caused by the valve not being opened. The valve should be opened once the fire is started, but the defendant had been repairing pipes before the incident, resulting in</p>
<p>Valve Closed</p>
<p>He forgot to open it when starting the fire on the morning of the 28th, so he started the fire, causing the water in the furnace to dry up and making a sound. Then he remembered that the valve was not open, so he immediately opened it, causing three thousand gallons of cold water to enter the extremely hot furnace, which then exploded. Meisheng testified that his words were the same as Tai's. When questioned, the defendant Xu Zulin confessed that the deceased Zhu Fenglai,</p>
<p>Was My Nephew</p>
<p>Had been helping me for three years. Because I was too tired from repairing pipes the night before the accident, I couldn’t get up on time the next morning, so Zhu started the fire for me, and unfortunately this disaster occurred. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and ordered the case to be adjourned for a week for further investigation.</p>

<p>Zhao Shusheng, Standing Committee Member of the National Postal Workers' Union, Standing Director of the China Labor Association, and Secretary General of Minli Middle School, passed away at his Shanghai residence on December 26th of last year due to overwork. At that time, people from all walks of life mourned the news, especially those in the postal sector.

<h3>Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>(14)</p>
<p>Question: I am a representative stationed in Shanghai by a merchant from another port. My residence in Shanghai is an apartment-style building with many households. Most of my incoming mail is business-related, and if it is mistakenly received by others, it will have a significant impact. I read the Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A in the tenth issue and learned that the post office has a "poste restante" service where the sender can specify that the mail be held at the post office for the recipient to pick up. I would like to follow this method and request the Shanghai Post Office not to deliver my mail according to the address and instead have it all held at the post office. Is this feasible?</p>
<p>Answer: The post office's "poste restante" service was originally designed to facilitate traveling merchants. All "poste restante" mail should not have a detailed address, except for the name of the recipient and the location. Instead, it should be marked with "poste restante." Your incoming mail already has a detailed address written on the envelope. The delivery post office must deliver it according to the address and cannot change it to the "poste restante" method at the post office's location. However, according to your situation, you can rent a private mailbox at the Shanghai Post Office, which is a public facility, to solve the problem. The details and rental procedures for this type of mailbox are described below.</p>
<p>Post offices in important locations, such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou, have private mailboxes for public rental. These mailboxes come in four sizes: No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4. No. 1 is the smallest, and No. 4 is the largest. The annual rent for No. 1 is six yuan, No. 2 is twelve yuan, No. 3 is eighteen yuan, and No. 4 is twenty-four yuan. The renter can choose one of the sizes and obtain a "mailbox rental application" from the post office, fill it out according to the instructions, and then submit the application along with the annual rent (according to the post office regulations, the rent is calculated quarterly, but six months' rent must be paid in advance when renting. For example, if you rent a No. 1 mailbox in January 1937, the annual rent is six yuan, and you must pay three yuan when renting. If you cancel the rental by mid-March, the rent will be calculated until the end of March, which is one yuan and five jiao. The remaining one yuan and five jiao can be refunded) and a deposit of five yuan to the post office staff. The staff will fill out a receipt, specify the mailbox number, and fill the number on the receipt. Then, the staff will hand the receipt and a set of keys for the mailbox to the renter. If the renter needs two or more keys, they can request them from the post office, paying five jiao for each additional key. However, it should be noted that these keys should be kept safe. If lost, regardless of whether there are spare keys, the post office should be notified immediately to replace the lock and return the spare keys to avoid the theft of mail.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Accident: Sisters, One Dead, One Injured</h3>
<p>Brakes Failed, Knocking Down Two Girls; Deceased's Autopsy Completed, Body Released to Father</p>
<p>Chen Zhijie, a native of Changzhou who runs a clothing store at No. 27 Renxing Street, Lane 1941, Yangshupu Road, has two daughters. The elder, Lanzhen, is 11 years old, and the younger, Renmei, is 5 years old. On the afternoon of the 6th of this month, around 1 PM, the sisters were returning home after playing outside. As they were walking hand in hand across the road from south to north at the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Guangxin Road, a No. 9 public bus, No. 15114, driven by Li Zhaosheng, came speeding from the west. Because the brakes failed, the left front wheel knocked both of them down, and they were severely injured. The police arrived after hearing the report, immediately copied down the bus number, and summoned an ambulance to the scene, immediately flying the two sisters to St. Heart Hospital for treatment. Renmei, due to more serious injuries, was unable to be saved and soon died. Lanzhen is still being treated, and her condition is unknown. The Yangshupu Police Station ordered detectives to investigate, and then moved Renmei's body to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang, appointed by the First Special District Court, arrived to examine the body. The head of the Western Police first reported the investigation process, and then Li Zhaosheng stated that he had been driving for three years, and that the deceased and others had emerged from behind a public bus traveling west, so he only glimpsed them 5 yards away. He tried to avoid them by turning the bus head south to avoid people, but was unable to avoid them, etc. The deceased's father, Chen Zhijie, stated that he was at home tailoring clothes that day, and his wife was washing clothes, so he didn't know the two girls had gone out. Now that one daughter had been killed and one daughter injured, he requested a ruling, etc. After hearing the statements, Zhang announced that the deceased, Chen Renmei, was a girl and was indeed killed by a No. 9 public bus. The body was released to her father, Chen Zhijie, with a signed receipt, and ordered the company to provide compensation.</p>
<h3>Chen Qian Accused of Abusing Adopted Daughter</h3>
<p>Using Firewood to Beat and Cigarettes to Burn; Biological Father Receives News, Comes to Shanghai to Report and Rescue</p>
<p>Chen Qian, a Huzhou woman residing at No. 158 Hongfuxing, Huade Road, paid 20 yuan to Xu Jiaji, a native of Haimen, in 1934 to adopt his daughter, Meizhuang (currently 14 years old). Subsequently, for slight carelessness in her work, she was severely beaten and burned with firewood and the ends of her cigarettes. The girl endured unbearable suffering, only sobbing quietly. Recently, the father was notified by a friend named Xu Zhiming in his hometown, who told him to go to Shanghai immediately to take the girl back, otherwise,</p>
<p>Her Life Was in Danger</p>
<p>Xu Jiaji then borrowed some travel expenses from relatives, took a boat to Shanghai, and waited near Hongfu Lane. Until 3 PM the day before yesterday, the girl went out to buy something. After learning the whole story from the girl, he went to the Yulin Road Police Station to report. Detective Xie Wanfang arrested her at her address and took her to the police station, then transferred her to the women's prison. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the First Special District Court. Labour Board lawyer Zhang Tianyin described the case, stating that on February 17th of last year, the police station received a phone call stating that at No. 158 Hongfu Lane,</p>
<p>There Was an Adopted Daughter</p>
<p>Being abused by her adoptive mother. The police station immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate, but Xu didn't dare to tell the truth, saying that nothing had happened, so the matter was not pursued. Currently, the girl was renamed Chen Aizhu by her. She told the police station that at the end of 1935, she was severely beaten with firewood by Chen, and in August 1936, because Chen needed hot tea when she was addicted to opium but didn't get it, she used the ends of her cigarettes to burn her head and arms. Since then, she has continued to use this vicious method many times. Recently, she</p>
<p>Pulled and Injured Her Left Ear</p>
<p>Quite severely. The abuse is real, but the scars and cigarette burns on her body have faded over time and are not obvious. A public prosecution is filed according to Article 286, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. However, the defendant denied the allegations at the police station, and the case is requested to be adjourned. Subsequently, Xu testified that she had been beaten and burned with firewood and cigarette ends several times by Chen. Her father, Xu Jiaji, stated that he sold his</p>
<p>Own Daughter</p>
<p>Meizhuang to Chen Qian for 20 yuan to be an adopted daughter because he was too poor to make a living. How could he know that she would abuse the girl like this? He also described how his friend Xu Zhiming had notified him in his hometown and how he had come to Shanghai. When questioned, Chen Qian stated that Xu had paid 80 yuan to her father Xu Jiaji to buy her as an adopted daughter. She denied beating her with firewood and burning her with lit cigarettes. The remaining confession was evasive. Judge Dai Rongduo ordered her to be remanded in custody, changed the date for further review, and sent Xu An to the hospital's forensic laboratory for detailed examination of the scars.</p>

<p>After completing the mailbox rental procedures, renters can print the mailbox number on their own stationery or other communication documents. All incoming mail, except for registered mail, express registered mail, parcels, insured mail, and cash-on-delivery mail, which are only placed in the mailbox with blank receipts or notifications, are sorted and placed in the mailbox by the post office upon arrival for the renter to pick up themselves.</p>
<p>In addition, for the convenience of the public, the post office has recently introduced a special mailbag system for areas without private mailboxes. The public can provide their own locked mailbag with a key and deposit it at the post office. All incoming mail will be placed in the bag by the post office for the recipient to pick up. The fees and procedures are roughly the same as renting a mailbox.</p>

<h3>### Arrest of a Rascal for Extortion</h3>
<p>Yin Duo Xi, a 29-year-old rascal from Yangzhou residing at No. 190 Ximen Road, on the afternoon of the 6th of this month, extorted money from Pan Jiaxiang, a copper artisan residing at No. 18 Tongfu Lane, Lan Weiai Road. When Pan couldn't comply, Yin forced Pan to a pawnshop and compelled him to pawn his overcoat for six yuan before leaving. Afterward, Pan, unwilling to accept this, reported it to the French Police, who dispatched officers to arrest Yin. Yesterday, Yin was sent to the Criminal Division of the Special First District Court. After a request for a postponement of the investigation, he was charged.

<h3>### Lawyer Guo Diaomei Appeals for Legal Fees</h3>
<p>Witness Ran to be Summoned for Questioning</p>
<p>Guo Diaomei, a lawyer from Fuzhou, was hired in September of last year by Wang Ziying, a native of Chongming who works at the Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and resides at No. 80 Jingu Village, Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession, to handle a civil lawsuit. When the engagement contract was drawn up, an initial agreement stipulated that the legal fees would be 20% of the 3,000 yuan lawsuit amount. Guo did not agree. He scratched out the amount in the contract and rewrote the legal fees as 600 yuan in national currency. Later, due to other reasons, the proceedings were halted. Guo urged Wang to pay the legal fees. Wang refused. Guo filed a suit in the Civil Division of the Special Second District Court against Wang Ziying to recover the 600 yuan in legal fees. After the trial, the court ruled against the plaintiff. Guo Diaomei appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, the civil division chief Xia Jinde and judges Tong and Fan questioned Guo in the civil third court. The appellant Guo Diaomei stated that he requested the original judgment be overturned and ordered the appellee to repay the 600 yuan in legal fees in national currency, as well as the statutory interest from the date of the lawsuit to the end of the execution, and the litigation costs of both the first and second instances. He reasoned that although the engagement contract had been altered, it was with the appellee's consent. The initial legal fees were specified as 20% of the lawsuit amount, but he did not agree because it violated the regulations of the Lawyers Association. The appellee agreed to the alteration, and he rewrote it as 600 yuan in national currency. It was agreed upon at the YMCA. The appellee didn't have a seal, so the witness Fang Zhenyu provided his seal as proof. Later, he prepared the lawsuit and was about to proceed, but the appellee's side had already reached a settlement. However, the agreed upon legal fees should be paid according to the contract. Zhang Xizhen (chief accountant of Hengfeng Yarn Factory) and Fang Zhenyu (currently secretary in the Beiping Municipal Government) should be summoned to testify. The appellee Wang Ziying requested the appeal be rejected. He said the Liang Peiji case was not settled. He lost the case in the First Special District Court. He and the appellant did not know each other before. He met him through a friend's introduction at a banquet and discussed the case with him. He said he volunteered to help as a duty. He didn't dare to accept the duty, so when the engagement contract was drafted, the legal fees were written as 20% of the lawsuit amount. He didn't know about the alteration. The contract was drafted at his home, and Wen Yinghu, the chief of the police station at the Temple of Confucius, and inspectors Xu Yuanyi and Er from the police bureau were present and could attest to it. After reviewing the situation, the court ordered the debate to be suspended and scheduled a retrial after summoning the witnesses. Guo was remanded to custody and Zhao was released on bail.</p>
<h3>### Wang Wenquan et al. Accused of Forgery and Fraud</h3>
<p>Mortgage Land Dispute</p>
<p>Zhang Yunbao, a local resident, operated a land and goods store on Rue des Soeurs, French Concession. In June of last year, due to slow business, he entrusted friends Xiao Qijing, Tan Jiangsheng, and Tan Maodi to mortgage a plot of land of over one mu to Wang Wenquan, a native of Anhui who operates a cloth factory on Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei, for 600 yuan for operating expenses. Unexpectedly, on the 12th of the same month, Wang Wenquan had a novel idea. He conspired with Xiao Qijing and Tan Jiangsheng to forge a seal in the name of Zhang He Shang, Zhang Yunbao's deceased father, and a secondary seal for Zhang Buqing. He also colluded with Chen Shiying, Dai Weizhi, and Li Jinchao to forge a mortgage certificate in the name of Zhang He Shang. Tan Jiangsheng impersonated Zhang He Shang and mortgaged the land to Chen Ningchao, a wealthy land merchant, for 1,400 yuan in national currency, which was then divided among them. On December 24th of the same year, they again colluded with Wang Daoli to forge a mortgage certificate in the name of Zhang He Shang and obtained an additional 500 yuan from Chen Ningchao, which was divided among them. After Zhang Yunbao learned of the situation, he redeemed the land from Chen Ningchao for 1,900 yuan and recovered the forged mortgage certificates and seals from Wang Wenquan and others. He then hired lawyer Sun Ba Wu to file a lawsuit with the District Court. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu detained Wang Wenquan and Xiao Qijing after investigating the facts. Based on violations of articles 216, 217, and 339 of the Criminal Law, he initiated a public prosecution. Tan Jiangsheng, Dai Weizhi, Chen Shiying, Li Jinchao, and Wang Daoli, who were at large, were placed on a wanted list. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Judge Lu Hongyi opened the trial. The judge ordered the defendants Wang Wenquan and Xiao Qijing to be brought to court. The plaintiff Zhang Yunbao, accompanied by lawyer Sun Ba Wu, appeared in court and recounted the events, pursuing a private lawsuit. Wang Wenquan, 39 years old, denied the forgery and fraud charges, stating that he was only a guarantor and that Tan Jiangsheng impersonated Zhang He Shang. Xiao Qijing, 52 years old, a native of Funing and owner of a incense business, testified similarly to Wang Wenquan. After the defense lawyer Hu Yuanjun concluded his argument, the judge deemed the hearing concluded and announced that the verdict would be delivered on the 13th. Wang Wenquan and Xiao Qijing were ordered to post a 5,000 yuan security bond.</p>
<h3>### Executive Yuan Orders Factories to Register</h3>
<p>All Must Be Completed by the End of June – Implementing Rewards and Relief</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan instructed this Municipal Government to order all factories to register. Existing factories that have not registered must register before the end of June this year. Factory report forms for 1936 must be submitted by the end of this month for review. The original order stated: (Omitted above) The Ministry of Industry reported that the purpose of Article 11 of the Factory Registration Regulations, which requires the submission of factory report forms, is to comprehensively understand the national industrial situation and annual operating conditions to provide guidelines for implementing industrial rewards, relief, and supervision to promote domestic industrial development. Since the beginning of implementation, many factories have been hesitant and watchful because it was a new undertaking, resulting in only 690 factories approved for registration by the end of 1935. After the Factory Registration Regulations were revised and submitted to the Executive Yuan for circulation to the provincial and municipal governments for strict supervision, progress was made in 1936, with a total of 1,441 factories registered by the end of the year. Combined with the factories registered previously, the total was 3,131 factories. In terms of numbers, this is still a small number and is insufficient to clarify the overall industrial situation, creating difficulties for industrial administration. In the future, continued efforts should be made to issue notifications to provincial and municipal governments to strictly enforce the regulations, aiming to complete the registration of all factories nationwide by the end of June 1937. New factories established thereafter should continue to register to ensure that the national industrial situation is fully understood and that industrial administration can proceed smoothly. This is the general situation regarding factory registration. Regarding the matter of ordering registered factories to submit factory report forms in accordance with the regulations, the Ministry has previously copied and attached the lists of factories registered before the end of January 1936 that should submit the 1935 report forms, and has included multiple blank factory report forms, which were sent to the provincial and municipal governments for distribution to the factories with instructions to fill them out. However, only a small number submitted them on time. Although reminders were sent, progress was not effectively made. Out of the 853 factories that should have submitted the 1935 report forms, only 400 had submitted them to the Ministry by the end of 1936, which is less than half the total and is insufficient to understand the operating conditions of various industries. Continued efforts should be made to urge the factories to submit them as soon as possible for statistical purposes. The Ministry has now copied and attached the lists of factories that should submit the 1936 report forms and has included complete blank report forms, which were sent to the provincial and municipal governments for distribution to the factories, with a deadline of the end of February for submitting them to the Ministry for review. This is the general situation regarding ordering factories to submit report forms. It is believed that registering factories and submitting report forms are important matters of industrial administration that greatly affect the future of domestic industry. Some factories in various regions may not understand this, leading to hesitation, and the supervision and progress of the local competent authorities may be lenient. The numbers of factories registered and the number of report forms submitted in various regions by the end of 1936 are listed below for review. It is requested that the Executive Yuan separately order the provincial and municipal governments to strictly instruct the competent authorities to ensure that all existing factories that have not registered must complete registration by the end of June 1937. New factories established thereafter should continue to be ordered to register, and those factories that should have submitted the 1935 report forms but have not done so must be ordered to submit them as soon as possible. Factories that should submit the 1936 report forms must submit them to the Ministry by the end of March 1937 for review and statistical purposes. Accordingly, approval should be granted, and in addition to separate orders, this order is issued for compliance. After receiving this order, the Municipal Government immediately forwarded it to the Social Affairs Bureau to urge all unregistered factories to comply.</p>

<h3>### Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I have read the news item titled "Disturbances Caused by Demolition and Bamboo Fencing in Longhua Town" in your newspaper's local news section on the 1st of this month, which states, "Because Landlord Lu and others could not collect rent, they secretly signed a treaty with the abbot of the temple to demolish the houses there to increase the rent and collect rent deposits."</p>
<p>After investigation, the agreement between the temple and Yin Dong to borrow money to repair the houses was reviewed and approved twice by all the chief stewards of the temple. It was signed publicly in the abbot's hall of the temple, with the signatures of more than ten chief stewards and the attestation of lawyer Pan Zhensheng. There were also witnesses present. How could it be a secret agreement?</p>
<p>The article also stated, "Lu and others hired many bamboo craftsmen to build fences, which was discovered by the tenants there. Because the annual incense season is approaching, if the fencing is used to force them to move, it will be like putting hundreds of people to death."</p>
<p>After investigation, the temple had already entrusted lawyer Pan Zhensheng to notify the tenants to move, and the rent was waived for two months. More than three months have passed since then. The tenants did not raise any objections within the deadline. When the Public Works Bureau urged the demolition of the houses, the tenants continued to occupy the property and obstruct the fencing. This kind of transgressive behavior will be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<p>However, after investigation, Landlord Lu has been protecting Longhua Temple and has been the benefactor of a large amount of land for generations. The history is long and can be verified by the stone tablet and the "Book of Ten Thousand Years" from the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, Lu's approval is required for all matters concerning the use, renovation, and reform of real estate. The tenants fabricated the fact that it was a treaty between the landlord and the temple. Is this not a groundless accusation to confuse the public?</p>
<p>After investigation, a small number of tenants owe large amounts of rent, many months before the landlord took over the collection of rent. The largest amount owed is more than twenty months. This time, the agitation of the situation and the defiance of the law are nothing more than attempts to seek their own illegal benefits, regardless of public safety. Your newspaper's misinformation is likely to cause misunderstandings and confuse the public. I hereby send this special letter to correct this and hope that you will publish it to rectify public opinion.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lu Shusheng, Landlord of Longhua Temple</p>
<p>No. 4 Lujiayan, Longhua Road</p>
<p>March 8, 1937</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I have just read the news item titled "Daughter-in-Law Accuses Father-in-Law of Encroachment" in your newspaper's local news section of March 2nd, which states that "Huang Changmu schemed to become the district leader."</p>
<p>According to me, I have been the district leader of the 23rd district of Yangjing for many years. Huang Changlin is only the former guarantor in the district. I am sending this special letter to ask your newspaper to correct this to show the truth. I would be grateful.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<h3>Indentured Girl Dies After Being Mortgaged for Rent and Suffering Injuries</h3>
<p>Neighbors Express Outrage Over Whipping and Abuse; Lu Qingchen and Wife Accused of Assault</p>
<p>Lu Qingchen, a 46-year-old man from Yanshan, Hebei, and his wife Zhao, of the same age, are the owners of the Yishunxing tobacco and paper shop located behind the Bureau Gate Road in the Nanshi district. Huo Changfu, who used to live in the back building of Lu Qingchen's property, was unemployed and impoverished, owing Lu more than 40 yuan in rent and more than 20 yuan in borrowed money. Unable to repay the debt, Huo Changfu sold his young indentured daughter, Daidizi (8 years old), to the Lu family to raise as a daughter. Huo Changfu then moved elsewhere. Unexpectedly, because Lu Qingchen and his wife had their own children, they did not cherish Daidizi. Because Daidizi was frail and often ill, she could not work for them. Therefore, she was often whipped and abused by Lu and his wife. Daidizi did not dare to speak up. During the last lunar month of the year, Daidizi became ill due to her injuries and was bedridden. Despite the severe cold, Daidizi only wore a torn cotton trousers, and Lu and his wife did not provide her with medical treatment but still ordered her to work. As a result, Daidizi died from her injuries on the morning of December 29th of last year. The neighbors, outraged by the injustice, reported the incident to the police and the District Court. Prosecutor Li Fen examined the body and confirmed that Daidizi had bruises on her chest, left waist, back, buttocks, and head, caused by blunt force trauma. Therefore, Prosecutor Li arrested Lu Qingchen, released Lu's wife Zhao on bail, and initiated a public prosecution on the charge of Article 277, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Judge Wang Shanxiang opened the trial yesterday. Lu Qingchen testified that he had adopted the girl and treated her well, denying any abuse and claiming ignorance of the illness that caused her death. He said he had bought medicine such as Huichun Dan to treat her and that the injuries on her body were caused by falling out of bed. He denied any abuse and hired lawyer Xu Lin to defend him. Witnesses Zhao Chunfu and Li Guoxing were questioned. Because the case required further investigation, the court adjourned the hearing and rescheduled it for a later date. Lu Qingchen was remanded to custody, while Lu's wife Zhao remained on bail.</p>
<h3>### Discussing Stubborn Ringworm</h3>
<p>Ringworm described as stubborn indicates the difficulty in its treatment. It is caused by the transmission of the trichophyton and similar fungi. It occurs on the easily moistened parts of the skin, such as the inner thighs and scrotum. From there, it spreads to the perineum, buttocks, or from the pubic mound to the abdomen and reaches the navel. It may also occur on the breasts, armpits, and nape of the neck. It initially appears as a coin-sized red spot with slight scaling, gradually growing to the size of a ten- or twenty-cash coin. The center slightly fades and becomes depressed, while the surrounding outline is clear and raised like a dike, with small blisters appearing everywhere. Later, dry scabs are left behind. It gradually increases in size and often causes intense itching, disturbing sleep and easily leading to neurasthenia. If a bactericidal and antipruritic agent with deep tissue penetration is not used, it is difficult to cure. In the past, physicians often considered such stubborn ringworm and sores as tricky cases. Now, there is a quick solution. It involves applying "Ganlu" medicinal liquid. After repeated use, it has been recognized as the most excellent and effective remedy for skin diseases and ringworm. The ingredients of "Ganlu" are excellent, and its quality is pure. Moreover, it is easy to use. If a patient develops ringworm or similar symptoms or has already developed them and they have not healed, they should immediately use "Ganlu" to treat it. It can quickly heal and prevent recurrence. This product is a well-known product of the Shanghai Tong Ren Western Drug Company. All drug stores in various ports sell it. Patients can purchase and try it locally.</p>
<h3>General Overview of Stomach Disease Symptoms and Treatments</h3>
<p>Stomach Disease Symptoms: Extremely complex. In brief: ㊀ Appetite. In severe stomach disease, gastric acid is often deficient, leading to a complete lack of appetite. However, conditions such as gastric ulcers, intestinal parasites, diabetes, and intestinal tumors can cause an abnormally increased appetite. In cases like gastric mucosal inflammation, gastric dilation, and gastric atony, appetite is slightly reduced compared to normal. ㊁ Thirst. Seen in conditions like acute gastric mucosal inflammation and gastric atony. ㊂ Nausea. Caused by abnormal fermentation, observed in gastric dilation, chronic gastric mucosal inflammation, and gastric atony. ㊃ Vomiting. Seen in conditions like renal mucosal inflammation, gastric ulcers, gastric dilation, and stomach cancer. ㊄ Belching. Sometimes caused by air being swallowed along with food, sometimes by abnormal fermentation, resulting in belching with a sour and foul odor. Persistent belching is mostly indicative of nervous stomach disorders. ㊅ Acid Reflux and Heartburn. Gastric ulcers, excessive gastric acid, and gastric dilation often cause this due to excessive hydrochloric acid or fermentation. ㊆ Stomach Fullness and Pressure. Fullness is more commonly seen in gastric dilation and atony, while a feeling of pressure is generally a symptom of nervous stomach disorders. ㊇ Stomach Pain. Gastric ulcers cause pain fifteen to forty-five minutes after eating, whereas nervous stomach pain is unrelated to food and may even feel better with pressure. Excessive gastric acid often causes pain during hunger. Gastric ulcer pain is like a knife, while gastric spasm pain is like being twisted. Stomach cancer causes dull pain. The symptoms of stomach ailments are numerous, and the suffering they cause is a constant, everyday ordeal. Their impact on health is significant. Now, there is "Wei Bi Ling". Despite the complexity of various stomach diseases, it can treat each one effectively. It relieves pain, stops vomiting, increases appetite, aids digestion, eliminates fullness and pressure, and prevents ulcers and cancerous growths. It is particularly effective in promoting secretion in cases of gastric acid deficiency and reducing acid levels in cases of gastric acid excess. Therefore, among stomach medications, it can be considered unique. This medicine is distributed by Tong Ren Western Medicine Company at No. 1 De Xing Lane, Xinjiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai. The fixed price is one yuan per box. It is also available at major pharmacies and the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company in Shanghai and other locations.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Yarn Market Exceptionally Weak This Month</h3>
<p>Most goods acquired last month have already been disposed of this month.</p>
<p>The yarn market experienced morning declines followed by afternoon rebounds, maintaining a relatively calm trend. However, a general bearish sentiment prevails due to yarn factories operating at full capacity with numerous new machines being installed, leading to anticipated increased production. Supply and demand are expected to balance out, resulting in strong speculative selling. Past rumors of Indian merchants controlling the market have led to a change of course among followers, who are now cashing out spot goods for March futures, resulting in massive deliveries. Consequently, despite the global cotton industry's prosperity, Shanghai's market is minimally affected, and the trend of spot yarn prices becoming lower in the near term and higher in the long term is emerging.</p>
<p>Sharp Decline After the Second Session</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market, prices for all months rose uniformly, buoyed by the bullish market conditions for Grade 1 American cotton, leading to active sentiment. Prices for all months increased by five jiao to one yuan. Unexpectedly, selling pressure intensified at the opening of the second session, causing a sharp decline. The market widely speculated that certain large players were reversing their positions in the near months. Therefore, despite Grade 3 yarn prices rising by nine to ten yuan, the market remained difficult to invigorate. The spot yarn market closed with prices for the current month down 1.1 yuan from the previous day's closing price, and prices for distant months down 1.46 yuan. The market atmosphere remained weak at the afternoon opening. Many bullish investors following Indian merchants reversed their positions in February futures, cashing out goods acquired last month for delivery. Sentiment remained weak, with prices declining by another seven jiao, while prices for distant months remained unchanged. The market slightly improved after the second session. By the close, Tianjin merchants purchased several hundred bales of warehouse yarn at prices three to three and a half yuan cheaper than market prices. Short positions slightly recovered but remained firm. The result was that prices for all months rebounded by four, five, seven, and eight jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was noted that Yuda sold 3,600 bales, Jinchang 1,800 bales, Mingde 1,450 bales, Hengde 850 bales, Yuan Yi 1,400 bales, Dachangcheng 1,400 bales, Taichang 1,300 bales, Tonghe 1,100 bales, and Run Kang 900 bales. Changfeng purchased 1,300 bales, Deda 1,300 bales, Dafeng 1,700 bales, Zhenda 1,600 bales, Wang Taixing 1,550 bales, Xiecheng 2,900 bales, Dachang 2,850 bales, Taichang 850 bales, and Changji 700 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Still Showing Support</p>
<p>A total of 1,886 bales were purchased by various merchant groups throughout the day, with prices showing signs of weakness. The prices for each merchant group are as follows:</p>
<h3>Futures Cotton Market Performance Mediocre</h3>
<p>The cotton market has stabilized. Although the rise in overseas Indian and American cotton markets feels dramatic, local sentiment remains mediocre due to sufficient cotton reserves and ample storage at factories. Market sources indicate that a significant portion of inland cotton has yet to be transported. Therefore, while foreign cotton prices rise daily, the price increase for local cotton remains restrained.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Price Increases Have Little Impact</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot flower market, prices for all months rose slightly by five to one jiao, while prices for distant months remained unchanged. At the opening of the second session, the market followed the decline in the yarn market, and sentiment eased. However, American cotton continued to rise, and the increase in Indian cotton prices was even more pronounced. Osaka's Grade 3 cotton prices also rose by 1.2 yuan or more. Despite this, local sentiment remained stable. The spot flower market closed with prices for all months down five fen from the previous day's closing price. Market conditions turned flat at the afternoon opening. Some expected a rebound due to the continuous rise in American cotton prices over several days, and buying interest eased slightly. The result was that prices for all months rose or fell by five to one and a half jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was noted that Yuanxingchang sold 3,000 dan, Jinchang 2,700 dan, Dafu 5,000 dan, Tongji 3,100 dan, Mingde 2,400 dan, Changji 1,700 dan, Shenchang 1,500 dan, Changyu 1,800 dan, Renfeng 2,200 dan, Yuan Yi 4,500 dan, Changfeng 3,000 dan, Run Kang 5,700 dan, Yongda 1,800 dan, and Yikang 5,800 dan. Dafeng purchased 2,800 dan, Hengyi 7,100 dan, Ruida 2,900 dan, Senkang 4,800 dan, Taichang 6,000 dan, Dachang 5,400 dan, Xincheng 5,200 dan, Changhe 9,200 dan, and Shenji 2,100 dan. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Factory Demand Remains Strong</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption remains fairly good. Factory demand remains strong, and the source of supply has not been disrupted.</p>
<h3>Grade 3 Yarn and Cotton Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Osaka dispatch on the 8th: Spot yarn prices increased by eight to ten yuan. 16-count fan-brand yarn at 249 yuan, up 9 yuan; 20-count goldfish-brand yarn at 270 yuan, up 10 yuan; 40-count five-star yarn at 400 yuan, also up 10 yuan; 42-count pheasant-brand yarn at 395 yuan, up 8 yuan. Grade 3 futures yarn prices increased by six jiao to 2.4 yuan, with near-month futures at 258 yuan and distant-month futures at 260.4 yuan. Futures cotton prices increased by 2.5 fen to 5.5 fen, with near-month futures at 78.6 yuan and distant-month futures at 82.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Premium Indian Cotton Very Active Last Week</h3>
<p>Due to rising American cotton prices last week, short sellers felt uneasy, resulting in a strong market. Premium cotton was very active, while low-grade cotton received little attention. Lancashire and mainland merchants made significant purchases. Japan remained absent from the market, except for old orders. It is reported that they are awaiting shipment to Japan. Indian yarn factories were more active than before. Developments in the Far East, with potential for growth, are worth noting. Given the current strong momentum, Japan may re-enter the market in the short term. A summary of last week's statistics is appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Spring Goods Sales Picking Up</h3>
<p>Spot goods mostly in the hands of fellow traders. Jardine &amp; Co. receives large South Seas orders.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market, stimulated by the continued surge in overseas cotton markets, led factories to maintain firm prices. With clear and warm weather, sales of light-colored spring piece goods gradually improved. Replenishment of goods by retailers and wholesalers in various regions was quite busy. However, large-volume purchases were still lacking. Cloth prices changed very little, with Dong Pi fine cloth and fine twill (84 raw cloth) being the firmest. 84 raw cloth further increased by one jiao per piece, and fine twill and fine cloth increased by 2.5 fen. Yanghe brand fine cloth and fine twill experienced a shortage of spot goods, leading to a sharp increase of five to seven and a half fen. Factories' recent futures orders were nearly exhausted. Yesterday, companies such as Ito opened sales of Dragon Head, Flower Bird, Yanghe and other brands, fine cloth and fine twill for May and June futures amounting to nearly a thousand pieces. Factory bids were firmer for near-term and looser for distant-term goods. Recent futures orders were mostly in the hands of large traders. Therefore, although spot business was not very prosperous, prices remained very firm. Transactions mainly involved local colored cloth merchants with a strong demand for dyed blanks. Qingniao Tianjin merchants purchased over two hundred pieces of Qingdao Shuangfeilong fine cloth, due to the firm Qingdao cloth market. Sales of printed and patterned goods were best for striped plain gauze and Sichuan-style Canton silk. Sichuan, Guangdong and Hunan all had wholesale orders urging shipment; other goods also saw activity. Colored cloths such as blue cloth, Shilin cloth, and colored twill remained sluggish in the customer groups. However, small retail sales to inland merchant groups were still good. The factory's coarse cloth and heavy-weight goods were selling best. Jardine &amp; Co. had accepted large orders from South Seas abroad, and as a result, daily shipments from Shanghai were greatly reduced, leading to a shortage of spot goods. The prices of fine cloth and fine twill were stable. There was smooth movement of goods to Guangdong, Yunnan, the Yangtze River region and Shanghai dye houses. However, the number of goods released by each factory was gradually reduced.</p>
<h3>Grains: Soybean Oil and Cakes Soar Again</h3>
<p>Primarily due to the influence of the Dalian grain market, coupled with concerns of a potential shortage of supplies. Oil up 7 jiao, beans up 1 jiao, cake up 3 fen.</p>
<p>Yesterday's standard soybean oil and cake markets opened, immediately stimulated by the reported price increase in Dalian. Spot goods saw active demand from both local and outside buyers. Sentiment from both within and outside the industry was uniformly bullish, with both new long positions and short covering, while trading houses initially resisted selling, but after hearing that Dalian news had stabilized, they began to release holdings. However, buying interest from outside the industry remained strong. Market prices saw both increases and decreases, ultimately with standard oil rising 4.5 to 2.5 jiao, standard beans rising 3-4 fen, and near-month cake also rising 1.5 fen. The prices of distant-month futures fluctuated.</p>
<p>The surge in the soybean cake market yesterday was more pronounced than in other markets. This was due to the boost from the jump in Dalian market prices, as well as fears of a potential shortage of supplies, resulting in a dramatic increase. As a result, both peanut oil and soybean oil rose by 7 jiao, soybean cake rose by 3 fen, and soybeans were even more sought after. The main reason was the sharp increase in Dalian, which invalidated previous arrangements, leading to a near-certain supply disruption. Furthermore, bean shipments by rail were also reduced due to insufficient railway capacity. Therefore, traders generally considered the base extremely solid, and uniformly raised prices. As a result, the market price rose sharply by one jiao compared to last Saturday, totaling over 13,000 bags of various beans traded. The future trend is still expected to be bullish with no retreat. The sesame market in foreign firms saw increased activity amidst frequent increases in oil prices. It was heard last Saturday that Japanese merchants were releasing 600 tons, initially priced at 14.35 yuan, which was later raised to 14.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Decline Steadily Throughout the Day</h3>
<p>Excessive market value… sluggish actual sales.</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw an initial period of stability followed by a decline in prices for all months. Prices for imported wheat saw only minimal fluctuations, with differences of only four to eight fen. After opening, initial sentiment was still positive, so opening prices were generally similar to the previous week's closing prices. The new flour market even saw a slight increase of one fen. However, softness was gradually seen in the second session, as the weather had improved but actual sales remained sluggish. Consequently, outside long positions began to offer positions, causing a decline of one fen for all months. As the afternoon market opened, selling pressure increased sharply, and trading activity also intensified, as retail long positions, observing sluggish actual sales, found it difficult to continue holding, and promptly unwound positions, causing the market to decline sharply, falling by three to five fen compared to the morning's highest prices. This situation was largely due to the excessive market value, inevitably leading to sluggish sales, so a trend of market fluctuation is expected.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Affected by Sunny Weather</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market also saw a trend of initial increases followed by a decline. Due to fluctuations in imported wheat prices, sentiment outside the industry remained firm. March and April far-term new wheat futures even rose by three to five fen. By the close of the session, due to weakness in the futures flour market, sentiment suddenly turned downward, falling by two to three fen compared to the opening session. The afternoon market saw uniformly softening sentiment, as flour sales were weak and the weather was sunny, leading long positions to take advantage of the situation to sell. Market prices fluctuated by three, five, and eight fen. According to reports from within the industry, there is still an estimated 20-30% of wheat remaining in storage in the Jiangbei region. Assuming steady shipments, there will be no shortages before the new wheat season. The spot wheat market remained stable, with Shaoxing wheat opening at 6.6 yuan, and Tongzhou wheat at 6.51 yuan, with approximately 2,000 bags traded.</p>
<h3>Customer Xian Rice Sales Gradually Improve in the Aftermarket</h3>
<p>Yesterday's customer xian rice market saw sluggish movement of goods from both local and outside buyers in the morning, with even more stagnant movement of Guangdong rice. Only three to four thousand bags of rice were traded throughout the day, while new arrivals kept flowing in, leading to very nervous sentiment. Prices of high-grade rice fell across the board by small amounts of five to six fen, with a continued trend of weakness. In the afternoon, local sales rebounded, and Guangdong buyers resumed inquiries, with Xiamen, Quanzhou, Shantou and Beiyang all making small purchases. The market immediately turned around, and prices also gradually recovered, with trading activity also increasing. Total sales increased to over 10,000 bags. If sales continue to be strong today and tomorrow, then market prices may improve further. A total of over 8,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, over 2,100 bags of Hunan rice, and 500 bags of Han rough rice were traded throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Hexia Rice Prices Continue Downward</h3>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, approximately thirty boats arrived from various Hexia ports. Trading activity on the market remained sluggish. White glutinous rice prices fell by small fractions to one jiao. Thin indica rice prices fell by small amounts of five to six fen. Due to competition from late Jiangxi machine-milled rice, sheep indica rice prices fell by small amounts of six to seven fen. Dufu sharp rice prices showed signs of weakness, customer sharp rice was scarce, and other goods were weak. White Yuan fell by nearly one jiao.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources of supply from various merchant groups increased, with a total of forty to fifty boats arriving, bringing approximately 9,300 to 9,400 piculs of rice. Of this, only about ten boats carried thin indica rice. Sentiment turned weak again. The local sales market turned stagnant. Package sales still consumed over 1,000 bags of thin indica rice, handled by Henan and Qingdao merchants, resulting in a flat and weak market. Thick glutinous rice prices fell by approximately one jiao. The limited arrivals of thin indica rice only allowed prices to recover by a few fen. Dufu sharp rice and Yin Yuan also fell by nearly one jiao.</p>
<h3>Finance: Gold Market Sees Selling Pressure</h3>

Hong Kong and Jewish merchants continued to hold. Banks still maintained their positions. HSBC's official rates, with both British and American rates unchanged, and the balancing tax up by 25, caused the market to fluctuate and stabilize. Later, although Sun Fung Foreign Company and Mobil covered American dollars, China Merchants Bank sold, and there was no momentum. At noon, the British exchange rate was flat and the American exchange rate was loose. The aftermarket saw banks taking positions, but most transactions were near-term, and there was a lot of exchange rate trading. Trading was relatively stable. The closing price for near-term selling prices was 1 shilling 2.625 pence for the British exchange rate and 29.71875 yuan for the American exchange rate.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds See Negligible Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the government bond market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange remained extremely sluggish. Large-scale transactions were few and far between. Retail investors were mostly eager to swap positions, resulting in minimal price fluctuations. The trend remained fairly steady, but due to the stability of the current situation and balanced buying and selling pressure, the bond market continued to fluctuate. Throughout the day, the morning opening saw firm and bullish sentiment, with retail investors making significant purchases. Numbers 10, 77 and others also bought a lot, while Numbers 5 and 13 sold. This caused market prices to rise slightly by five fen to one jiao and a half. The trading floor was increasingly quiet in the second session. The above numbers made slight purchases, while retail investors entered and exited haphazardly. C and Ding bonds rose by five fen, while Type B bonds for next month fell by a small five fen. The afternoon market showed an increasingly stagnant trend. The opening involved scattered retail investors swapping positions, with market prices fluctuating only slightly by five fen. At the close, Numbers 16 and 71 and others slightly sold off. C and Ding bonds showed a weakening decline of roughly one jiao, but overall sentiment remained sluggish. The overall result was that all unified bonds only showed a fluctuation of five fen to one jiao. The total number of transactions was 2.6 million yuan. A comparison of the price fluctuations, highs, and lows is listed in the table to the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Production Prices Reported Higher; Coarse and White Sugar Rebound by Five Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a slight rebound as Parisian raw sugar prices turned higher. The association set prices for Grade 24 raw white spot goods at 22.8 yuan and transit goods at 7.4 yuan, both up five fen. Dongbai spot goods and transit goods of numbers 489 all maintained their original prices. The Zhenji Dahua Jinxin factory's refined white sugar and other sugars also saw no changes. The trade of numbered goods was very limited, as actual sales were still not significantly active. Only Guangdong merchants opened sales of over three hundred new arriving Beihai slab Qing sugar, priced at 11.4 yuan. The trend is still strong. Chao sugar production prices were set, and market numbers in Shanghai were also observing the opportunity, with no prospects for development in the short term.</p>
<p>The joint company held its first auction this week for Guangdong sugar futures. Slightly increased trading saw the sale of 2,111 bags of Shunde factory's Five Sheep brand coarse white sugar for 22.6 yuan, and 430 bags of Dongguan factory's coarse white sugar for the same price. Huizhou medium fine white sugar at the original price; no transactions were made.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Candied Dates Tighten as Top-Grade Supplies Dwindle</h3>
<p>Mid-grade candied dates, such as "Tutu" brand, saw a potentially looser market due to ongoing arrivals. However, the top-grade market was tight due to a shortage of goods. Special Grade goods were selling for 60 yuan, large-face goods for 46-47 yuan, and higher-quality "Tutu" brand goods for 44 yuan, with protection against declines. Lower-grade Gong-face goods sold for 40-38 yuan.</p>
<h3>Nanning Star Anise Sales Turn Weak</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, Nanning star anise had reached 40 yuan. However, recently sales have weakened, and a certain company released a batch of inferior goods, revealing a slightly lower price of only 27.5 yuan, inevitably affecting the market. Currently, Nanning goods are priced at 39 yuan, and Beihai goods at 38 yuan, with potentially softer prices.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Silk Continues to See Selling Pressure Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk markets saw no market in New York. Yokohama spot goods briefly surpassed the 900-yuan level, with spot prices up 15 yuan and futures prices up 6 yuan compared to last Saturday. However, by the afternoon, both had fallen back by around 10 yuan. Shanghai silk markets saw continued selling pressure on new silk. For example, B-grade, 7-8 evenness, 20-22 denier heavy reeled silk for June-July delivery from the White Factory was priced at 745 yuan. Companies such as Dachang and Lianna each completed transactions. French silk sales showed no progress. User silk demand gradually increased, and factories such as Mayar each purchased goods. Common B-grade Tiantai goods were priced at 755 yuan, up 15 yuan compared to last week.</p>
<h3>Metals: Wessco Iron Inventory Shallow</h3>
<p>New transactions for 200-pound American Wessco iron have recently been very active, with customer groups and factories all procuring supplies. Due to its low price, stockpilers have also been absorbing significant amounts, so market conditions are very firm. Standard prices have been rising rapidly, selling for 42 yuan per box (old steel factory) and 40.075 yuan (new steel factory). However, due to the shallow inventory, prices have improved significantly compared to the past. Based on the recent increase in overseas prices, coupled with limited sources of supply, the outlook for the market is very promising.</p>
<h3>Six-Foot White Iron Recovers Bullish Momentum</h3>
<p>Six-foot Dong white iron experienced a softening in the market, retreating to 1.17-1.18 yuan, due to spot goods being released by stockpilers. Recently, overseas prices for black iron sheet and zinc (both raw materials for making white iron sheet) have been rising rapidly, so the market outlook has improved again. Market sentiment has expanded and bullish momentum has recovered. Yesterday, it was observed that 5,500-5,600 sheets were sold, priced at 1.2-1.223 yuan. It was heard that Sichuan merchants had a strong buying intention yesterday, so opening prices are expected to rise further in the coming market.</p>
<h3>Introducing "Report on Observation of Japanese Cooperative Enterprises"</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Zimi, an expert member of the Shanghai Municipal Cooperative Enterprise Committee, was dispatched to Japan last year to observe cooperative enterprises in the neighboring country and gained considerable insights. After returning to China, he immediately engaged in compiling the book "Report on Observation of Japanese Cooperative Enterprises," which elaborates in detail on Japanese cooperative enterprises, as well as cooperative pawnshops, cooperative societies, and companies. It is indeed a valuable reference work for cooperative enterprises. The book also includes prefaces by Mr. Zhang Yuanshan, Director of the Cooperative Department of the Ministry of Industry, and Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. The book has already been published, with a price of 30 cents per copy. The publisher is Shanghai Liming Bookstore, and it is sold by Shanghai Bank Weekly, Life Bookstore, Nanjing Chinese Cooperative Society, and major bookstores.</p>
<h3>Compilation Method of Income Tax Return Forms (5)</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>(Two) Company Reporting Form</p>
<p>According to Article 45 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, when a joint-stock limited company or a joint-stock partnership company issues shares, it shall report the total amount of shares, types of shares, amount per share, and business year to the local competent tax collection authority. For shares already issued, each company shall, within one month from the date of implementation of these regulations, report the aforementioned matters to the local competent tax collection authority. Furthermore, according to Article 46 of the regulations, companies... shall, within one month from the date of implementation of these regulations, report the name, address, business, actual amount of capital or share capital to the local competent tax collection authority. The company reporting form is the declaration registration form used to report the aforementioned matters. The matters to be filled in are explained as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Mutual Title</p>
<p>A company must have a fixed name; therefore, the name is listed first on this form. Furthermore, companies are categorized as unlimited liability companies, limited partnership companies, joint-stock limited companies, and joint-stock partnership companies; therefore, the type of company should also be clearly stated in the name. The type of company is actually part of the company name. The information filled in should be the same as that filled in the license obtained from the company registration authority. The name section of this form is pre-printed with the words "股份" (shares). If it is an unlimited liability company or a limited partnership company, these two characters should be crossed out. This should be noted when filling in the form.</p>
<p>(2) Business Type</p>
<p>According to Articles 13, 71, 88, and 217 of the Company Law, the type of business of a company should be clearly stipulated in the articles of association. The company license issued by the Ministry of Industry will reflect what is stipulated in the articles of association. The information filled in on this form should be the same as that stated in the articles of association and the company license. According to Article 12 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Article 12 of the Guidelines for the Collection of Income Tax on First-Category Profit-Seeking Enterprises, any buying or selling or business outside of the main business and related businesses should be included in the total income if there is a profit. If there is a loss, the tax collection authority cannot consider it a necessary and reasonable expense or loss in business. When filling in the business type on this form, attention should be paid to the scope of the business.</p>
<p>(3) Company Address</p>
<p>According to the Company Law, the location of the company's headquarters and branch offices is also a matter for registration. The company address filled in on this form is the registered location of the company, which is also the address listed on the registration license for the company's headquarters and branch offices issued by the Ministry of Industry. If it is the headquarters, the address of the headquarters should be filled in. If it is a branch office, the address of the branch office should be filled in.</p>
<p>(4) Name of Responsible Person</p>
<p>Article 27 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulates that the business responsible person shall be responsible for reporting and paying the first category of income from profit-seeking enterprises and withholding and paying the second and third categories of income. The nature of the responsible person's name filled in on this form should be the same. According to the provisions of the Company Law, in an unlimited liability company, a limited partnership company, and a joint-stock partnership company, the partners with unlimited liability have the right and obligation to conduct business. However, if the articles of association stipulate that one or several of the partners shall conduct the business, that stipulation shall prevail. The company's external representative may also be specifically designated as a certain partner by the articles of association or with the consent of all partners. If no specific designation has been made, each partner may represent the company. In a joint-stock limited company, the directors are responsible for conducting business. One or several of the directors may be specifically designated to represent the company according to the articles of association or the resolution of the shareholders' meeting. According to these provisions, the business of the company should be the responsibility of the partner with unlimited liability or the director representing the company. However, the Company Law also provides for the position of manager for various companies. The manager should be under the control of the partner with unlimited liability or the director and engage in the operation of the business. Therefore, the manager is also the responsible person for the business. For the convenience of reporting and paying income tax, it seems appropriate for the name of the responsible person filled in on this form to be the name of the manager if the company has a manager.</p>
<p>(5) Total Share Amount, Amount per Share, Paid-in Share Amount</p>
<p>According to Articles 88 and 217 of the Company Law, the total share amount and the amount per share are stated in the articles of association and company license of a joint-stock limited company and a joint-stock partnership company. The information filled in on this form should naturally be the same. However, for unlimited liability companies and limited partnership companies, according to Articles 13 and 11 of the Company Law, there are only provisions regarding the type and value of the partners' contributions, and no mention of the total share amount. As for the amount per share, in this type of company, the contributions of each partner are not called shares, and there is no uniform amount per share. When filling in this form, it seems appropriate to fill in the total amount of contributions in the position of the total share amount and change the word "股份" (shares) to "出資" (contribution). The position for the amount per share can be left blank. Only joint-stock limited companies and joint-stock partnership companies need to fill in the paid-in share amount. According to the provisions of the Company Law, after a shareholder with limited liability of shares subscribes for shares, he can first pay half of the amount per share and does not have to pay the full amount at once. The total amount of shares actually received by the entire company should be filled in on this form to correspond to the total share amount. As for unlimited liability companies and limited partnership companies, the partners' contributions are paid in full at once. The total amount of contributions is the paid-in share amount.</p>
<p>(6) Types of Shares</p>
<p>According to company regulations, unlimited liability companies and limited partnership companies are not allowed to issue shares. The limited liability partner portion of joint-stock limited companies and joint-stock partnership companies can issue shares after company registration. From the perspective of the shareholder's account name, there are two types of shares: registered and unregistered. The amount of unregistered shares shall not exceed one-third of the total share amount. From the perspective of the shareholder's rights, there are preferred shares and common shares. All of these should be clearly stated in this form. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Dream</h3>
<p>— (Yan Maode)</p>
<p>Marten once said: "Everything now is but the sum of the dreamers of past eras—the realization of the dreams of past eras makes life valuable, releases mankind from baseness, and elevates mankind from mediocrity and ugliness—we all have to thank our dreamers."</p>
<p>So dreaming is not a bad thing. In dreams, one can gain fresh life, and can guide the path to success. Electrician Edison once dreamed of extracting a milky substance from weeds that could be used to make rubber. He started experimenting from dreams. After two years, he actually discovered it.</p>
<p>But to have dreams without practical application is a waste of energy, without benefiting reality. Having dreams must be accompanied by firm will and determination to realize the dream. Not only should dreams be developed as much as possible, but doing must follow behind dreams. Having only wishes, without exerting strength to realize the dreams, is enough to ruin things. Therefore, one must have practical dreams. Dreaming with hard work, and continuous effort, is useful.</p>
<p>Dreams are stimulants, but also poisons. They can make people foolish, and also make people successful. Let dreams be our slaves, and not let them be our masters.</p>
<h3>Jilin City after the Incident</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiang</p>
<p>If you had lived in Jilin before, and return to visit again after five years, the changes there would make you gasp.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the road outside Xinkaimen, what you see are rows of low, flat houses with a different style. The facade decorations and the arrangement in the windows are also completely different. This road is called the Commercial Concession. The × country's consulate is built here, so everything surrounding the consulate is built into uniform residences and shops, forming a different landscape. This cannot help but make you feel as if you are in a completely unfamiliar environment, so strange and surprising.</p>
<p>Walking into Henan Street, the commercial center in the city, the wooden sidewalks on both sides have been demolished. Although the street is wider than before, the market is covered with a layer of extremely desolate atmosphere. Strolling into the Hexinglong Department Store, which is the best in the city, you only see more shop assistants than customers, quiet and deserted. The golden age of bustling crowds has passed. But the opposite is true for those Zuixiange, Yunzhongxianguan..., which have sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain on the streets and alleys. Every evening, there are crowded with cars and horses, really bustling. It is said that those "drunk immortals" freeze to death by the hundreds every year in the snowy and icy weather. How alarming is that "hundred"!</p>
<p>On Dongdatan (street name) along the river, you can no longer see people from Shandong, Hebei and other provinces. Before the incident, this street was their gathering base. Every year, many people came from inside the pass to find a living and settled here, so this place became the birthplace of their family businesses. However, in these years, under the glorious light of Wangdao, they could not live as before and fled back to the pass like stray dogs one after another. Now this place has been "taken over by magpies and occupied by doves" by another kind of people. — The street scene is strangely desolate.</p>
<p>The gates of the residences of the wealthy in the Dongguan and Yanjiang Street areas are all tightly closed. The courtyards are as quiet as if no one lived there. No matter how much you knock, they won't easily open the door for you. What's going on? It is said that they are afraid of those ronin or Koreans who visit from time to time. When they step into the gate, they will peddle the things they carry: such as letter paper, envelopes, or towels, soap, etc. It is not accepted to reject their kindness in coming to the door; it is accepted, but you have to give them ten or twenty times the high price to fill their desires. There are also those who come in and tell you about his years of wandering in the Northeast, suffering all kinds of misfortunes, and now want to return to his country, lacking travel expenses, etc. While talking, he takes out watches or rings and other things, earnestly asking you to keep them. Then, if you are smart, you will quickly give him a decent amount of money and return the original object, so that you can avoid all unnecessary entanglements; isn't this called "civilized plunder"?</p>
<p>▼ News from the Painting World The Suzhou National Painting Tutoring and Research Society is hosted by Mr. Liu Junran and other famous painters in Wuzhong. It has been around for years, with complete equipment and serious teaching. Many students follow them.

<p>— (Zhi)</p>
<p>Special Announcement This newspaper has received a letter from the Huachuan Township Office in the Second District of Yancheng County, stating that the article "Chen Xiaokan, Women's Kingdom at Xinyang Port" published in this newspaper on January 26 is completely inconsistent with the facts and damages the reputation of the township. After investigation, Mr. Chen is a new contributor to this newspaper, and there may be inaccuracies in his account. Since the township office has sent a letter of criticism, it should be solemnly corrected and an apology given.</p>
<h3>New Year's Eve of Bingzi</h3>
<p>— (Tianxu Wosheng)</p>
<p>Suddenly returning home on New Year's Eve, the children started shouting. A dog and three chicks were vying to be around my knees. The crowd spoke in unison, all saying "good, good, good." Two hands were not enough to hold, and two elbows were not enough to hug. My wife came downstairs to greet me, smiling before saying a word. "Why say you won't return? You've finally returned." "Since you were going to return, why didn't you return earlier?" I said unexpectedly, but it felt wonderful. An uninvited guest arrived, why bother sending notice in advance? I was originally in my hometown, ready to be the host, inviting friends in the city to enjoy chicken and millet together. Thinking back to my home, I always feel like someone is missing. Coming by express train is like sleeping. Time cannot be bought. Why waste it? Separation and joy, all depend on the heart. Don't ask about the past, the future is unpredictable. Life is like a bubble. All destinies are coincidences. Tonight, there is no need to sleep. We will sit together until dawn. I am still afraid of being in a dream, hearing the rooster crowing in my ears.</p>

<h3>Phoenix Swapping Nests</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven (Whispered Sentiments of Compassionate Parents, Confessions of Filial Piety, Autumn Light Dimming Emerald Dais, Inspired by the Scenery)</p>
<p>But at this time, the scenery in the sky was even more worthy of appreciation, so he still leaned on the window sill, looking out, unwilling to leave. Later, Xiaoju brought up the kerosene lamp with both hands, put it down, and squeezed to the window sill to stand, smiling and asking: "Miss, what are you looking at that is so interesting? I'll take a look too." Menglan saw that she was holding the window sill with both hands, only supporting herself upwards, and said with a smile: "What are you keeping? Why are you working so hard?" Xiaoju said: "Miss, what are you looking at? I'm looking at what you are looking at." Menglan pushed her away and immediately closed the window, laughing, "What are you being silly about?" Xiaoju took two steps back, leaning against the door, looking at him and said: "Am I being silly? Because Miss was squeezing forward to look, that's why I followed and looked forward." Menglan smiled: "I have a mental illness, are you following me to be mentally ill too?" Xiaoju stretched out his head cutely, paying attention to Menglan's face. He asked: "Why is Miss always acting so crazy and dazed?" Menglan said: "You want to ask me this reason? You...you won't understand. But if you don't understand, that's your blessing." Xiaoju looked at him and said: "Miss, what does this mean?" Menglan said: "Tell you what it means, haven't you already understood? If you understand, you won't have any blessing. Do you still want to be without blessing? Don't be silly here, let's go downstairs together." Xiaoju looked at Menglan, smiled with his head down, and went downstairs. Menglan turned up the lamp wick a little, took a book and spread it on the table, just about to sit down to read. But Xiaoju shouted loudly downstairs: "Miss, come down to eat quickly, everyone is waiting for you. Madam told me to call you." Menglan then faced the mirror hanging on the wall, putting on a welcoming smile. Smiling once, she was still afraid that it wasn't very natural. She looked in the mirror four or five times in a row, and then said to herself: "It's probably okay." She touched her hair, and tugged at her clothes, and then went to the main room to eat dinner. When she was sitting at the table, she was always afraid that her attitude wasn't natural enough, so she deliberately talked and laughed with her mother and sister-in-law, showing a bit of happiness. Mrs. Jiang was indeed different from usual when eating this meal, always looking him up and down all over his body. Menglan smiled and ate the meal, but did not immediately go upstairs. She washed her face and drank tea in her mother's room for a long time, chatting for a while before returning upstairs. When eating, the second young mistress was most worried, besides always looking at him, she also followed his tone of voice and found something to talk about. Only after he went upstairs did she feel relieved, but was Menglan's mind really settled? This was the case at home. The next morning, when he went to school, those two eyebrows were wrinkled together again. He was the earliest person to get up in the whole family. He frowned, and only Xiaoju, who got up to serve tea, saw his expression. (142)</p>
<p>Minor Records of Celebrities</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the World's Four Giants (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Chao Xi</p>
<p>1. Stalin, who Sleeps in Boots</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, Stalin, the most powerful man today, is famous in the world for sleeping in boots. His hard bed is placed next to his mahogany desk. According to researchers, this desk was the one used by the notorious Interior Minister Trepov, famous during the imperial era, to conduct official business.</p>
<p>It was this Interior Minister Trepov who sentenced Stalin, a highly dangerous revolutionary, to life imprisonment in the salt mines of Siberia. Originally, people sentenced to such exile had no possibility of returning to their hometown. However, in a twist of fate, not only did Stalin eventually return, but he also became the owner of the mahogany desk that had once held the power to control him. Now, Stalin signs and issues his powerful documents on this desk, with its deep connection to the past.</p>
<p>Stalin, the cornerstone of the Communist Party, dresses extremely simply, truly befitting the king of a worker-peasant nation. He wears a rough shirt, black velvet trousers, and always boots. An outfit with a tie and coat is the ultimate in attention to detail. The only decorations in his outfit are the red tie and the collar of his undershirt.</p>
<p>Stalin is a figure who never smiles, but even more remarkable is that what he says is very difficult for people to understand. Unless one has lived in his hometown of the Caucasus, it is not easy to understand his speech. What he says is a kind of mixed language spoken by Slavic Jews, without much grammar. When he was exiled to Siberia, he was influenced daily by the many Jewish political prisoners there.</p>
<p>Stalin, who holds absolute power in Russia, could live a life of extreme luxury, but the only things he eats daily are onions mixed with eggs (seasoned with chicken gravy) and coarse black bread. He is also suspicious that the cook will poison him, and always eats food he prepares himself. He is truly a hard-working man.</p>
<p>2. Kemal, who Loves to Dance</p>
<p>Kemal, the outstanding hero of the new Turkey, was born in Thessaloniki on the Mediterranean coast. He has the natural character of a Turkish soldier. His English is very good, so he not only often speaks English, but also writes all his private letters in English. Being such an extreme person, he never sits on cushions or sleeps on futons like ordinary Turks. He sits on a chair and sleeps in a bed. The only Turkish custom that Kemal retains is the habit of leisurely sipping coffee after eating grilled beef and meat buns.</p>
<p>He is an extremely diligent worker, desperately indulging in play. The introduction of jazz dancing into Turkey and the popularity of dancing in Turkey are entirely due to Kemal. Among them, the tango and foxtrot are his favorite styles. Kemal can be said to be a modern gentleman among the dictators of the day.</p>
<h3>Viewing Plum Blossoms (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>But my strong desire for appreciation cannot be satisfied by watching from the window every day. Therefore, even in the middle of the day, I would carry a volume of my favorite book and stroll towards the plum blossom forest, as simple as snowflakes and as misty as smoke. I would sit on a square platform there, turning the pages of the book while admiring the plum blossoms. The light breeze would carry a burst of fragrance towards my nostrils, intoxicating me. When I read something interesting, the book would fall from my hands onto the grass. My consciousness only felt that something was dazzling me together with the plum blossoms in front of me, but what exactly was that thing? I couldn't remember it for a moment. However, in short, it was powerfully tempting me, grabbing me, making me so leisurely and fascinated!</p>
<p>Occasionally, two small birds would fly around like shuttles between the branches of the plum forest. They seemed to be happily jumping and chirping, one tree after another, making the plum blossoms not feel lonely. But sometimes, touching a thin branch would startle those plum petals, causing them to detach from the branches in a hurry and float to the ground. Floating, floating, one piece fell into the grassy path, and another fell again, tirelessly floating, floating, floating. Finally, this dull gray grassy path was covered with pieces of white things. And even more petals, like lone widows in revolving white clothes, would intimately stick to my shoulders and hair; I bent back my sleeves to take a closer look, and felt that it looked like a delicate pattern. Holding it in my palm, I felt a kind of pitying caress. I wanted to pick some up and treasure them, like treasuring my own life.</p>
<p>— Returning wanderer! Soon you will wander to the ends of the earth again, but your only confidante—plum blossom, perhaps you won’t come to accompany us next year when it blooms again. In speechless silence, I understood the satire that the plum blossoms gave me, but I finally felt ashamed and painful. Looking up, another plum blossom petal was imprinted on my forehead, and I couldn't help but shiver. In that way, a memory that had been lingered on for many years returned to my mind. I remembered my wandering life, remembered the hope of seeing plum blossoms, remembered the innocence and ignorant happiness of my childhood, remembered…</p>
<p>A feeling of a young man being soaked in old age, sadly crossed my lonely heart:</p>
<p>— The precious youth will never return, but the plum blossoms I saw in my childhood are still as lovely as ever!</p>
<h3>The Poisonous Fragrance of Wildflowers</h3>
<p>— Le Jia</p>
<p>Accusation of a Double Offense</p>
<p>“The wildflowers are always more fragrant than the domestic flowers.” This saying may be true, but the fragrance of wildflowers is often poisonous. Smelling this poisonous fragrance will give those who love to pick wildflowers a serious blow.</p>
<p>Similarly, those who disregard their families and go outside for wild affairs will also be infected with gonorrhea. Suffering from gonorrhea will give them unspeakable pain.</p>
<p>Moreover, people suffering from gonorrhea not only harm themselves, but also bring disaster to their wives, which can be said to be a "double offense." What is there to say about "wildflowers being more fragrant than domestic flowers"?</p>
<p>As for gonorrhea infection, it is important to seek treatment quickly, because in the early acute stage, although the pain is more severe, it is also easier to cure. If you delay treatment or take ineffective medications, it will become a prolonged chronic condition, with the risk of sudden onset of gonorrhea-related complications at any time. Therefore, gonorrhea patients should only take "Deli Ping." It is based on the latest scientific formula, with the power to directly reach the lesion, completely eliminate gonococci. Whether it is new or old gonorrhea, leucorrhea in women, and all gonorrhea complications, taking it can be effective and achieve complete recovery. Those who have committed a double offense or want to avoid committing one, please pay attention.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites for Implementing a Public Health System (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jiqing (Speaker), Kuai Wenquan (Recorder)</p>
<p>Fellow students, the term "public health system" has filled your ears since you arrived at the Public Health Personnel Training Class of the Department of Health. What methods should be used to realize the public health system? Therefore, it is imperative to conduct a substantial study of the prerequisites for a public health system. I will now share my personal research. I would not call this a lecture; I hope that my fellow students will offer their critiques. This is my personal wish.</p>
<p>What is the motivation for a public health system? The need for a public health system is not accidental; it is based on several factors. We can see this from two perspectives:</p>
<p>Looking at it internationally, we can identify three reasons:</p>
<p>1. People's thinking was completely different before and after the European War. The European War can be considered a turning point in the political, economic, and educational transformations of Europe. Before the European War, ideas were based on a minority perspective and lacked foundation. After the European War, everything changed completely, starting from the lowest levels. Floating idly in the upper echelons is no longer viable. Take medicine, for example. Previously, there was chemical physiology, anatomy, etc. Now, with the advancement of medicine, it is felt that previous scholarship is insufficient; it is necessary to study sociology in conjunction for easier effectiveness. This is because medicine is not a pure science; it must arise from social consciousness.</p>
<p>2. U.S. President Hoover established the Committee on the Costs of Medical Care in 1927, which had a five-year plan. When the committee published its findings in 1932, the results were a blow not only to the United States itself but also internationally. People pointed out the errors in medical organization, and we cannot simply copy them.</p>
<p>3. The medical construction in Soviet Russia and several Eastern European countries. They have already implemented a revolution in modern medicine. The art of healing in Soviet Russia was previously handled by private individuals, resulting in disorganized medical facilities based on individual interests. Soviet Russia completely eradicated this traditional concept and established a socialized medical facility based on rational design and organization, which can serve as a model for us.</p>
<p>There are five domestic motivations:</p>
<p>1. National health bankruptcy. The mortality rate is higher than other countries, and life expectancy is shorter. Emphasizing quality over quantity puts us at a disadvantage compared to other nations. Although the physical training of our citizens has been resolved in theory, it has not been implemented. However, the authorities at least have some understanding.</p>
<p>2. Weak national economy.</p>
<p>Health expenditures in rural areas cannot exceed one dime per person, and in urban areas, they cannot exceed 3.5 to 5 dimes per person. The weakness of the national economy has reached an extreme point.</p>
<p>3. Low national education.</p>
<p>According to a survey in Ding County, each person spends an average of five dimes, and each family spends an average of five yuan, on old medicine or praying to gods and Buddhas. Such deep-rooted superstitions must be eradicated, and education is essential.</p>
<p>4. Lack of medical talent.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Department of Health as of January 11, 1937, there were a total of 8,722 physicians nationwide. Even if there are 2,000 more physicians who have not registered, that is still one physician for every 40,000 people. There were only 19 registered dentists, 2,964 midwives, and 2,269 pharmacists. As for nurses, it is estimated that there are about 7,000 to 8,000, making the total number of medical personnel less than 20,000. Given the size of our country and the population, this is insufficient. Furthermore, physicians are concentrated in cities, and there are none in rural areas. Thus, 80% to 85% of our country's farmers do not receive the protection of scientific medicine.</p>
<p>5. Current medical facilities are not widespread.</p>
<p>Currently, except for a few major trading ports that have scientific medical equipment, the number in remote and inconvenient rural areas is almost zero.</p>
<p>With these five domestic difficulties and the recent significant resolution of international medical issues, the domestic and international medical situations have converged to form a method that suits both the trends and the economic conditions of rural areas: a public health system.</p>
<p>The meaning of a public health system:</p>
<p>1.  A public health system aims to increase and protect the health of all citizens.</p>
<p>2.  A public health system is planned. For example, when traveling from a starting point to a destination, there will inevitably be obstacles. Immediately knocking down obstacles is a revolutionary approach, which is not permissible in our country's social situation. Temporarily retreating when encountering obstacles and advancing when the opportunity arises will eventually lead to the destination. This is an evolutionary approach, which is needed for us to promote a public health system. Retreating and not advancing, or even changing direction, is something we do not need.</p>
<h3>Review of Intestinal Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Zhong Zhihe</p>
<p>Ulcerative intestinal tuberculosis is the most common complication of pulmonary tuberculosis. According to autopsies at the Metropolitan Hospital in New York, 72% of deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis have ulcerative enteritis. According to a survey by Brown and Sampson, approximately 50% to 80% of deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis exhibit intestinal tuberculosis. According to statistics from Montcfiare Hospital, among 526 deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis, 344 had complications of intestinal tuberculosis, accounting for 65%.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the Metropolitan Hospital in New York, among 744 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, X-ray examinations revealed ulcerative enteritis. However, only 29% of them showed gastrointestinal symptoms during the examination.</p>
<p>According to the research of many physicians, positive sputum (containing tubercle bacilli) is closely related to intestinal tuberculosis. According to the hospital's statistics, among 740 patients with intestinal tuberculosis, only 4.5% had negative sputum.</p>
<p>In addition, lung cavities have a direct and close relationship with ulcerative enteritis. According to statistics, 95% of patients with ulcerative enteritis have cavities in their lungs. The various aspects of intestinal tuberculosis are described below for reference:</p>
<p>(A) Location of Intestinal Tuberculosis</p>
<p>The location of intestinal tuberculosis is noteworthy. Most of the infected areas are in the cecum and the terminal ileum, appendix, and ascending colon.</p>
<p>According to Roepke's survey, in patients with open pulmonary tuberculosis, 50% have involvement of the entire intestinal tract. Damage to the small intestine accounts for 90%, the colon 80%, and the appendix 70%. From the cecum to the rectum, the incidence gradually decreases.</p>
<p>According to Maylerd, citing statistics from Feuwick and Dodwel, among 883 deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis, ulcers were found in the intestines of 500 patients. The colon had the highest number of cases, with the ascending colon accounting for 51.4%, the transverse colon 30.6%, the descending colon 21%, and the sigmoid colon 13.5%.</p>
<p>(B) How Intestinal Tuberculosis is Contracted</p>
<p>1.  Tubercle bacilli reach the intestines through blood circulation, leading to infection.</p>
<p>2.  Tubercle bacilli infect the intestines through lymphatic circulation.</p>
<p>3.  Pulmonary tuberculosis patients who swallow sputum containing tubercle bacilli that are not killed by stomach acid cause intestinal infection.</p>
<p>(C) Symptoms of Intestinal Tuberculosis</p>
<p>1.  Night stool is the most valuable symptom. Ordinary colitis often causes diarrhea in the morning.</p>
<p>2.  Persistent diarrhea is also a characteristic of intestinal tuberculosis. The frequency of diarrhea ranges from two to three times a day in mild cases to eight to ten or more times a day in severe cases. Intermittent constipation may also occur.</p>
<p>3.  The stool is thin, brownish-black, or resembles "slag-like" color, with an abnormal odor. It often contains decaying intestinal matter and blood (or occult blood). However, 10% to 20% of patients may experience constipation.</p>
<p>4.  Body temperature is often elevated and persistent, or fluctuates unpredictably.</p>
<p>5.  Relative bradycardia is present.</p>
<p>6.  Body weight decreases sharply due to poor appetite, impaired intestinal digestion, and the inability of the intestines to absorb food, leading to rapid weight loss. According to Fishberg's experience, weight gained over several months, which is valuable and hard-earned, can disappear almost entirely in a week. In two to four weeks, the patient becomes emaciated and haggard.</p>
<p>7.  Severe anemia is present, with a pale, bronze-like complexion. In the late stages of the disease, the extremities often exhibit edema and shortness of breath, and the patient is restless.</p>
<p>(D) Prevention of Intestinal Tuberculosis</p>
<p>1.  Advise patients to avoid swallowing sputum and inform them of the dangers to raise awareness.</p>
<p>2.  For those with insufficient stomach acid, which makes it difficult to kill tubercle bacilli, administer diluted hydrochloric acid to enhance the stomach's sterilizing power.</p>
<p>3.  Pay attention to intestinal stasis and prevent constipation.</p>
<p>4.  For pulmonary tuberculosis patients with symptoms such as gastrointestinal indigestion, diagnose and treat them early. This is especially important for those with diarrhea.</p>
<p>(E) Treatment of Intestinal Tuberculosis</p>
<p>1.  Correct the bad habit of pulmonary tuberculosis patients swallowing sputum. Also, take urgent measures to suppress lung damage, such as applying artificial pneumothorax, phrenic nerve resection, thoracoplasty, or oleothorax, to make the sputum turn negative as soon as possible, not containing tubercle bacilli, which can reduce the absorption of toxins and alleviate intestinal symptoms.</p>
<p>2.  Patients must rest in bed. (A) Most patients have active pulmonary tuberculosis. Resting can reduce the chance of transmission through blood circulation, etc. (B) Resting can reduce intestinal irritation and peristalsis, which is conducive to the damage.</p>
<p>3.  The choice of food for intestinal tuberculosis patients is extremely important. (A) Reduce the amount of fluids ingested. Cold drinks can stimulate the intestinal tract and cause peristalsis, leading to diarrhea and abdominal pain, and should be strictly prohibited. (B) Provide nutritious foods with high caloric value and appropriate amounts of vitamins. (C) Vegetables containing a lot of plant fiber should not be eaten in large quantities. Fatty fruits, sugar foods, honey, and cakes should be avoided as much as possible, as these foods can ferment and produce gas, causing the patient to suffer. (D) Those who can tolerate milk can drink more milk. However, if discomfort is felt after eating, add lime water or sodium bicarbonate, or coffee and cocoa powder. All kinds of food should be eaten hot. (E) Raw eggs and raw milk are not easily digested and are prone to bloating, belching, and diarrhea, so it is best not to eat them. (D) Eat more Vitamin C, such as tomatoes or tangerines. Mixing four parts of tomato juice or tangerine juice with one part of cod liver oil and taking it three times a day is excellent. Gastrointestinal inflammation and chronic pancreatic disease are caused by vitamin A deficiency, so using it to treat intestinal tuberculosis is particularly effective. It is even better to use it with Vitamin D.</p>
<p>4.  Heat therapy: For those with diarrhea, apply a hot water bag to the abdomen after each meal to help digestion and relax intestinal spasms. Abdominal pain can be alleviated. In addition, patients should stay warm, and special attention should be paid to the abdomen. Drinks and food should be hot. Applying Rland enemas is very helpful. For those with gas in the abdomen, adding a teaspoon of turpentine oil for direct irrigation is very effective. Rectal irrigation with hot saline is also good.</p>
<p>5.  Sterilize the patient's excrement thoroughly. According to recent reports from doctors, Dakin's Solution has the strongest bactericidal effect on tubercle bacilli and can be used to prevent transmission. Other disinfectants can also be used.</p>
<p>6.  Light therapy: Natural sunlight and ultraviolet rays are the first choice, but because most patients have pulmonary tuberculosis, improper use can be harmful. Caution must be exercised. Some now advocate using X-rays for treatment.</p>
<p>7.  Drug therapy: (A) Cholesterin can be taken because it has the value of increasing calcium absorption. (B) Hot compresses can be used for abdominal pain, and sedatives can be taken, such as opium preparations or their derivatives, or Atropine Sulphate can be taken orally or injected subcutaneously to relax intestinal spasms. (C) Tannin preparations can be taken for diarrhea to stop astringency. Bismuth preparations have an antidiarrheal effect. Barium Sulphate or Kaomin and other agents also have the same effect. (D) Calcium agents are used for treatment. When calcium agents reach the intestines, they can turn the fat in the intestines into calcified alkali, which has an astringent effect. Second, when it is absorbed, it has the function of relaxing intestinal spasms. Intravenous injection has a faster effect. Commonly used ones are 5% to 10% calcium chloride or calcium gluconate, 10 cc every other day. (E) For anemia, in addition to giving spleen preparations orally or by injection, blood transfusion can also be used. (End)</p>
<h3>Native Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>2.  Show Ying Flower, Jasminum odoratissimum, L. Jasmin (German), Jasmine (English)</p>
<p>(Plant) Native to Madeira (northwest Africa), can be cultivated everywhere, is an evergreen shrub. The leaves are odd-pinnate compound leaves, with one to two pairs of leaflets, leathery, broad oval or lanceolate, with a blunt tip. Terminal clustered umbels, yellow split-basin-shaped sympetalous flowers bloom in early summer, with a unique fragrance.</p>
<p>(Crude drug) Show Ying Flower, Flos Jasmini odoratissimi, is collected from its flowers and dried.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) If this flower is extracted with petroleum ether, a balm of 4% is obtained. The balm consists of 50% essential oil and 50% wax. The components of the essential oil are dextrorotatory linalool, linalyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl acetate, indole, anthranilic acid methyl ester, and sesquiterpene alcohol (57% of the essential oil), etc. The wax is mainly Triacontan C30H62.</p>
<p>(Medicinal use) Show Ying flower is mixed into tea leaves, and after a few days, the floral fragrance is absorbed by the tea leaves, so Show Ying flower can be used as a flavoring agent in tea leaves.</p>
<p>3.  Jasmine, Jasminum Sambac, Aiton</p>
<p>(Plant) Widely cultivated in the tropics, is a vine-like shrub. The leaves are opposite, or three whorled, short-stalked, leathery, oval, with a sharp tip, and some with a blunt tip. Terminal or axillary cymes of three, occasionally more, small pale yellow flowers bloom in early summer. The capsule is oval.</p>
<p>(Crude drug) Jasmine, Flos Sambac, is collected from its flowers and dried.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) When the flower is immersed in petroleum ether, 0.08% of balm is obtained. The balm contains essential oils and waxes. The main components of the essential oil are formic acid, acetic acid, and benzoic acid, linalool, benzyl acetate, anthranilic acid methyl ester, indole, chain sesquiterpene, sesquiterpene alcohol, etc.</p>
<p>The main components of the wax are paraffin wax such as C28 H58, C30 H62, C32 H66, etc.</p>
<p>(Medicinal use) Filipinos use a decoction of the flowers to treat conjunctivitis. Indians use the flower leaves as a plaster.</p>
<p>(Other uses) This flower can be used as a flavoring agent for tea leaves.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites for Promoting Rural Health Work (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yi Dan</p>
<p>2.  Medical care must be affordable for the common people.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the impact of natural and man-made disasters, the entire rural area has reached a state of extreme depression. Rural areas have gradually declined, and there is a tendency for self-sufficiency to be insufficient. Because the foundation of rural areas has fundamentally failed, the rural economy has also presented a panic phenomenon. This bad phenomenon can be verified anytime and anywhere and cannot be denied. Think about where they have any surplus money to pay for medical treatment? I dare say that they usually don't have such thoughts at all. This is from a substantive point of view. At the same time, we should know that today's Chinese farmers, because their bodies have long been in such a difficult and arduous situation, have unconsciously developed the habit of thrift and hard work. Therefore, even some of the very few local rich people, we see that they still eat coarse and unpalatable rice and wheat, and wear tattered clothes, so you would never think that he is a person with tens of thousands of fortunes. In short, their thoughts are transferred by the changes in the environment! They think that money is more important than life, so most farmers, because of economic hardship, are sick and have no money to treat them, so they have to endure it bitterly. Even a few rich people are willing to endure the pain of illness and will never spend money to treat it easily. Only when the illness becomes serious and life-threatening will they be willing to spend a few "funeral money." This has become a common phenomenon. From this type of situation, rural medical care must be made affordable for the common people, and it must be affordable under their economic capacity. Only then will the masses of farmers be willing to come for consultation and treatment, and only then will the masses of farmers be able to get practical benefits. From this, farmers can have a deep and good impression of the health methods we implement.</p>
<p>3.  Promote the increase of agricultural production.</p>
<p>The rural economy should be based on the amount of agricultural production, because the source of the rural economy is obtained from agricultural production. This is a very obvious fact. Seeing the current economic situation of rural China, it has reached the point of extreme collapse. Therefore, the writing of "medical care must be affordable for the common people" is precisely to remedy this deficiency. However, if we continue to implement that method in one direction, we will inevitably fail to achieve the final satisfactory effect. Think about such a vast rural area in China, where does the authorities have such a budget to be used to rescue rural areas? Therefore, our only way is to also promote the increase of agricultural production and run water conservancy and other undertakings that are beneficial to agricultural production, so that the rural economy has a fundamentally active source. Then, the rural economy can be revived and become active again. In this way, a situation of national strength and prosperity, singing and dancing can be created. On the one hand, of course, the government's supply of health funds can also be generous. Then, at the same time, farmers can also enjoy considerable prices for the supply of new medicines and health facilities. Therefore, we can say that promoting the increase of agricultural production is the greatest force for promoting rural health.</p>
<p>4.  Maintain natural hygiene.</p>
<p>Originally, farmers lived in that kind of environment. Apart from spending all day in that cesspool-like small area where humans and animals lived together, nature has given them a lot of benefits invisibly—that is, hygiene! Such as fresh air, full sunlight, beautiful and pleasing scenery, and the unsightly work when half-naked, exposed to sunlight, etc. At the same time, their habit of getting up early to work and returning late to sleep sweetly has also formed a natural phenomenon. These types of natural phenomena are most suitable under hygienic conditions. Where can you enjoy such a privileged environment in a prosperous city? At the same time, how can the masters, wives, and young ladies in the city have such a great and admirable habit? Therefore, in the process of promoting rural health, it is really necessary to bring it up for discussion, because if we can pay attention to maintaining these types of natural hygiene, we can make the determination of farmers' belief more firm and we can get effortless help, and promote the promotion of rural health.</p>
<p>5.  Banning quack doctors and midwives.</p>
<p>According to Malthus's population theory, the reproduction of the population increases geometrically, doubling every 25 years. Therefore, the damage caused by diseases that are not formally proportional is the biggest reason. Just in terms of the number of quack doctors and midwives poisoning life in rural areas, there are simply no numbers that can be statistically determined. And now these types of unconventional itinerant practitioners are almost scattered throughout the entire rural area. Their methods are really clever, they can seduce the masses of farmers and plunge them into their confusion, so that the masses of farmers believe in them and have a close match with them, thinking that the quack doctor is the only healer, and the midwife is a skilled birth attendant. Similarly, this kind of work has become their iron rice bowl, and the opportunity for survival naturally depends on this point. However, can the newly formed facts benefit farmers? I dare say that under their unscientific and unmedical knowledge, there will never be a satisfactory result. We only need to pay a little attention, and the number of farmers who die young from diseases and die unjustly in childbirth is really alarming. This kind of out-of-the-ordinary death clearly proves that it is a tragedy caused by them, but their methods are really flexible. In order to prevent the exposure of incompetence, they added the vague term "doctors can cure diseases, but they cannot cure fate" to cover up their crimes. Now, the practice of reforming rural health is no different from giving them a head-on blow, and under this dangerous situation of life crisis, they will naturally make cunning propaganda at the moment when the masses of farmers believe in them. At the same time, the psychology of the masses of farmers will of course always tend to be on their side. Therefore, it has become a powerful indirect counterattack against us. This competitive situation has become a huge obstacle to promoting health at present, so how can we not try to ban it?</p>
<p>6.  Conclusion</p>
<p>These few conditional problems, we certainly cannot say that they are already complete, but I think they can be considered as several central conditions for promoting rural health, and if any one of them is abandoned, there is a possibility of hindering the promotion of other conditions. Therefore, I can say that in order for my country's current rural health to open up a new path, the above conditions are the work that we should solve first. If we can take on this mission and carry it out effectively, we can generally get considerable gains, but we cannot be satisfied with this, we must generate new methods, and therefore we cannot help but hope that health experts at home and abroad will contribute more to consolidate the strength of promotion. Here, what we need to pay attention to is that if the work of promoting rural health is carried out solely by the health community, the rate will definitely be very slow, and it will not be easy to get considerable achievements. We must also rely on the continued assistance of all parties, unite with each other to jointly plan and promote, in order to achieve the final goal and create the happiness of farmers and the foundation of a strong country!

<h3>Report on Sanitary Inspections in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, etc. (4)</h3>
<p>— Chu Jin-fang</p>
<p>(III) Financial Overview</p>
<p>Due to the progress in sanitary administration in the bureau each year, the funding has also increased progressively. The following is a list of the budgeted expenditures for the bureau's sanitary expenses from the 21st to the 24th year:</p>
<p>In the bureau's regular sanitary expenses, street cleaning consistently accounts for more than half of the total expenditure each year, followed by hygiene testing and meat inspection fees, treatment fees, general affairs fees, epidemic prevention fees, school hygiene fees, and hygiene education fees. As for large-scale summer cholera prevention and hygiene campaigns, these are handled with separate temporary funds.</p>
<p>2. Shanghai Municipal Hospital. This hospital is located opposite the Central District Health Bureau of Shanghai, with a site of approximately 80 mu, valued at 300,000 yuan, construction costs of 300,000 yuan, and equipment costs of 150,000 yuan, totaling 750,000 yuan. The scale is grand, but due to the tense situation, the equipment installation, etc., has not been fully completed, so the opening date will still require some time.</p>
<p>The position of hospital director is concurrently held by President Weng of Tongji University. In the future, students from the Medical College of Tongji University will undertake internships at the hospital. The connection between the hospital and the school will definitely be mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>3. Hygiene Testing Laboratory</p>
<p>The laboratory is located next to the Shanghai Hospital, and the equipment is quite complete. Unfortunately, at the time of the inspection, due to the influence of the current situation, the laboratory had stored some important instruments and equipment, and a complete view could not be obtained, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>4. Wusong District Health Office</p>
<p>This office is jointly operated by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, Tongji University, and other schools and factories in Wusong, but the administrative authority rests with the Health Bureau. It focuses on handling various public health matters, with an attached clinic and ward facilities, with more than ten beds. The daily fee is 3 jiao per person, regardless of grade. It is planned that once the Shanghai Municipal Hospital opens, the ward will be cancelled to fully focus on public health matters.</p>
<p>The office's monthly expenses are 1600-1700 yuan, with Tongji University subsidizing 500 yuan, the Health Bureau allocating 600 yuan, and the rest being raised and subsidized by various schools and factories. In addition to treating the diseases of the public who come to the clinic, the office also sends doctors and public health nurses to various schools and factories to treat the diseases of students and workers, and to handle all health matters for the schools and factories. At the same time, it serves as a practical training ground for some students of Tongji University. Therefore, all schools and factories are happy to help with fundraising.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the registration method of the clinic uses the difference between the patient's age and the year the clinic was established as a standard, so that each patient's medical record becomes a system, making it easier to check, which is unseen in other hospitals and clinics. The method is as follows:</p>
<p>Calculate by subtracting the year the clinic was established from the patient's age. For example, if the patient's actual age is 11 years old and the clinic was established 5 years ago, then subtract 5 from 11, and the patient's age on the medical record should be written as 6 years old.</p>

<h3>What methods will the General Labor Union use to help workers?</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>In order to promote labor services and improve the family lives of workers, the Shanghai General Labor Union has specially decided to establish a women workers' family service corps, which will be divided into groups to provide services. The work of this corps lies in investigating the living conditions of workers' families, and guiding labor families in hygiene and children's education, among other matters. This approach can be said to be very good, and it shows the General Labor Union's concern for the lives of workers.</p>
<p>The hardships of workers' family lives are known to all. They work hard all year round, selling their blood and sweat. Their contribution to society cannot be considered small. However, their living conditions are like those of cattle and horses. Because the remuneration workers receive is extremely low, even basic food, clothing, and shelter cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>Recently, many people have paid attention to the lives of general laborers, advocating for the protection of labor. However, protecting labor is easy to say, but a little difficult to implement. Protection by national law is naturally powerful. But our country does not lack laws to protect labor, and the result has been little effect. Asking employers for preferential treatment, we are willing to seek it but cannot obtain it. But most employers only see their own interests and do not care about the lives and deaths of workers. They are trying every means to carry out insatiable exploitation.</p>
<p>Then this responsibility falls on the labor union. The labor union is an organization that seeks happiness for workers, and is responsible for relieving pain and rescuing the lives of a group of workers. The resolution of the Shanghai General Labor Union to establish a women workers' family service corps is intended for this purpose.</p>
<p>But what methods will the General Labor Union use to help workers? Investigating the living conditions of workers' families is necessary. Guiding labor families in hygiene and children's education is also very beneficial to workers. However, just conducting investigations is not enough. After the investigation, finding ways to improve their lives is the most important work.</p>
<p>The corps' family visits should focus on what workers suffer from the most and what they hope for the most. From our point of view, the most painful thing for general workers must be the difficulty of life. At the same time, the most hopeful thing must be the improvement of life. This is not just a hypothesis, the facts are like this, and everyone can see it.</p>
<p>Therefore, we very much hope that after the General Labor Union conducts the investigation, it can provide some relief for the family lives of a group of workers. This will not only benefit the workers, but also be a benefit to society.</p>
<h3>A Visit to Tropical Fish</h3>
<p>— Nan Ju</p>
<p>Tropical fish, this tempting name, has appeared again in this luxurious and splendid sea. Many people may not understand what exactly tropical fish are. Yesterday, a reporter made a special trip to the newly opened "Good Fun Fish Store" in Shanghai to make a detailed visit to tropical fish. Now, based on what Mr. Li Yihe, the owner of "Good Fun Fish Store" said, I am writing it here for the reference of the newspaper's readers.</p>
<p>The location of the Good Fun Fish Store is at 312 Julida Road. The facade is deep red and the layout is very elegant. The owner, Mr. Li Yihe, has been raising tropical fish for two or three years, so he is very clear about the breeding, price and types of tropical fish. Now let's talk about it separately:</p>
<p>Types of Tropical Fish There are many types of tropical fish, generally there are one or two hundred types. The Good Fun Fish Store currently has about twenty or thirty types. When it comes to tropical fish, what can make people most interested is the color and appearance of the fish. Now let me list a few: ㊀ Angelfish—This kind of fish has the best style, with a flat and wide belly and long whiskers on its tail. It is indeed beautiful when it floats at the bottom of the transparent glass tank; ㊁ Glass fish—The most interesting thing about this kind of fish is that its entire skeleton is completely transparent. Every small thorn on its body can be seen clearly; ㊂ Colored fish—This kind of fish is gray when it is young, but when it grows up, its whole body can turn into five colors, which is extremely beautiful. In addition, there are "long-mouthed fish", the fish are very small, and there is a long barb on the upper lip. It often floats on the surface of the water and is reluctant to swim to the bottom; triangular fish, the body of the fish is triangular; red-toothed fish, the body of the fish is light red; mosaic fish, the whole body is flat gray.</p>
<p>There are also two very strange fish. One is called "fighting fish". It looks like a goldfish, but its body is blue. It comes from India. This fish is combative. When two fish meet, they will fight in the water. Indians often use this "fighting fish" for gambling; there is also a "calling fish", the body of the fish is long and narrow, and it can make low noises in the water.</p>
<p>Producing area of tropical fish The producing area of tropical fish is mostly in Germany, and there are also tropical fish in India, Mexico, and the United States. Because this kind of fish has always grown in the warm waters of the tropics, it is not easy to bring it to China. Often the fish brought back on Tianlun ships die halfway.</p>
<p>Breeding method The average water temperature for raising tropical fish must be between 76 and 80 degrees. If it is too hot, add cold water, and if it is too cold, increase the water temperature; therefore, a specially made glass box for raising fish (transparent on five sides) is now made. Inside, there is a thermometer attached to it, which should be used to check the temperature of the water at any time. The food for fish is water worms, which should be fed about four times a day; the water can be changed frequently. In the glass fish tank, the bottom layer is fine sand, and many aquatic plants from Honolulu are also planted. Ordinary aquatic plants will rot when the temperature is warm, but this aquatic plant does not.</p>
<p>Fish Reproduction The reproduction of tropical fish can be divided into two types: one is viviparous and the other is oviparous. There is a fish called Du Fu Gelami fish, whose reproduction is very interesting. First, the male spits a white froth on the surface of the water, and then it drives the female fish into the froth to let it give birth to offspring. After the female fish lays her offspring on the grass, immediately move the female fish to another glass tank, otherwise it will eat its own offspring.</p>
<p>Fish prices Because this kind of fish is not easy to bring to Shanghai, the price is very expensive. Ordinary small fish cost five yuan a pair, and a specially made glass tank costs more than ten yuan. Larger fish cost more than ten yuan a pair, and they easily die if they are not raised properly. Even the aquatic plants from Honolulu cost one yuan for five inches, and some only sell for two inches. It is really too aristocratic.</p>
<h3>Spring in the Shantytown</h3>
<p>— Written by Ma Mengchen</p>
<h3>A Rainy Day Story</h3>
<p>— Wang Shengtian</p>
<p>Whenever it rains, I seem to have many stories to tell myself before I feel comfortable: raindrops on branches, raindrops under thatched roofs, and even puddles of rainwater in the fields, all remind me of the impressions brought about by my childhood, these impressions, like pairs of bright eyes, stare at me and make it impossible for me to avoid them.</p>
<p>When picking tea leaves in the valley, I once bravely bathed in the rain on the tea trees for a whole day, so that my clothes were soaked without an inch of dry yarn, but I was still very happy in my heart, and carried a full basket of tea leaves back home.</p>
<p>Time after time, I worked in the fields in the rain, without a raincoat or a hat. I liked this in spring, and I liked it even more in summer. In January, when yellow rapeseed flowers filled the ridges of the fields, I took a hoe to the fields to loosen the soil, and filled the dustpan with rapeseed hearts. If, at this time, raindrops touched my head, I would definitely be naughty and happy like Lao San, who herded the cattle, and we would say in unison, "Old God, don't cry, please give us both longevity and blessings!"</p>
<p>In late spring, the weather often likes to change its face. At this time, the work in the fields became easier, so I was usually sent by my family to the neighboring village to bake tea. During the tea-baking season, it rained eight out of ten days. In the tea-baking room, there were mostly teenage village girls, with small braids tied with red velvet threads hanging behind their heads. Several older people leisurely supervised us. Thus, outside the house was the sound of drizzling rain, and inside the house was the lively sound of singing and laughter.</p>
<p>Once, Yun and I were baking tea together. She was a petite, lively, and innocent country girl. I don't know why, she talked to me about rainy days.</p>
<p>"Don't you know about rainy days?" She opened her big eyes, her eyes full of satisfying doubt!</p>
<p>I just shook my head to show that I didn't know.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't you know about rainy days? It's like this, aren't there many stars that can be seen on clear nights? These many stars are the eyes of the Old God, because he wants to see many people on the ground, so he has so many eyes. The Old God treats us very well, he treats everyone equally, without being partial! The days when we see the sun come out, this is the Old God telling us that he is very happy, because many people on the ground are doing many things that are in line with the Old God's heart; if one day, the weather changes and it rains in bursts, this is telling us that many people on the ground are committing sins, making evil; making the Old God angry and sad; so he sheds tears..."</p>
<p>"Then, why can't you see the stars during the day?" I knew she was making up stories, so I retorted her like this.</p>
<p>"You are really a perfect idiot! Such a common thing, and you still don't know it. I want to ask you, do people need to sleep? What happens to their eyes when they sleep?... We people sleep at night, and the Old God sleeps during the day..."</p>
<p>After Yun became a bride, we had very few opportunities to meet; naturally, such fairytale-like rainy day stories would never be heard again.</p>
<p>Recently, a person ran from Xicun to my house and told us that Yun had hanged herself, and told us that the day before Yun died, his father had a dream of a family dying tragically; later, the person from Xicun solemnly declared to us that Yun's suicide was considered a blessing for Yun's family...</p>
<p>Early spring has entered the human world, and the continuous spring rain is about to follow. When my mind is made lonely by the rainy day, I think of Yun's expression when telling rainy day stories, and even more of the sadness of the countryside in the interior where theocracy is still ruling!</p>
<h3>The Festival of Welcoming the Gods</h3>
<p>— Nan Ou</p>
<p>—Customs of Nanyang</p>
<p>When I was still a young child, I always looked forward to the annual festival of welcoming the gods by the Javanese. Needless to say, this motivation was entirely for the sake of joining in the fun. I cannot say that I had any piety for the gods worshipped by the different races. Every time the Javanese happily carried their idols in a parade through the streets for those two days, I and the other children were equally ecstatic; looking back on such things now is truly moving.</p>
<p>We Chinese call such an event "The Javanese Ghosts' Tour." In fact, those going on tour are "gods," not "ghosts." During the day, the area where the Javanese gather is bustling. They go to the streets to drink and enjoy themselves; and the usually heavily guarded temples are also opened. So, the children and I all gathered at the temple. In that crowd, I saw Malays wearing colorful sarongs; Dutch people with blue eyes; Indians wearing red and green headscarves; and naturally, the most were us Chinese. I once heard someone say</p>
<p>Continued on page 5</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>that the Javanese temple during the festival is the most realistic human race exhibition hall, which is truly an apt description. On that day, no less than tens of thousands of people entered and exited the temple! We scurried around everywhere, from here to there, and finally saw the idol sitting solemnly in the main hall. The Javanese piously kowtowed before it, while European and American gentlemen stood aside smiling, walking around with an attitude of curiosity. Young Javanese also gathered together to beat drums; the sound of the drums rumbled and was transmitted from morning to night, as if they never wanted to stop.</p>
<p>The most lively time was in the evening. The night in the South Seas is filled with the smell of seawater, and the stars and moon are dotted in the black sky. In order to maintain order on the streets, the police were all busy, and on both sides of the street, many people quickly gathered to watch the fun. At this time, I no longer had the freedom to move around. My grandmother had to keep an eye on me, for fear that I would encounter some accident. She carefully led me to wait by the street that the Javanese god would pass through. So, after anxiously waiting and waiting, the piercing sound of drums could finally be heard. Then, a light appeared at one end of the street, the sound of the drums became louder and louder, and a long string of people slowly approached, holding the idol. In front of the statue, a pair of masked people danced, eight cows pulled the idol, and behind it followed countless Javanese. Such a festival of welcoming the gods did not originally have anything particularly worth seeing, but the crowding situation was unimaginable.</p>
<p>The Javanese team walked away, and the people here gradually dispersed. My grandmother then led me home and said, "Okay, you've seen the welcoming of the gods, it's time to sleep well."</p>
<p>Such a festival of welcoming the gods lasted for two days; on the second night, there was another lively scene as usual, as well as a grand fireworks display, and I naturally asked my grandmother to take me to see it. White, red, and green sparks burned, embellishing the quiet southern night sky and exciting people's emotions...</p>
<p>But my age grew, and gradually I lost interest in the Javanese festival of welcoming the gods, and I no longer had that kind of mood to join in the fun. And the air of the colony finally had a day that suffocated me, so I left my birthplace and returned to the embrace of my motherland.</p>

Jingyang Ridge has a striped tiger nearby. Sound the gong to gather the people in advance to guard against it. Wu Song didn't see it and had no worries. Drunk and in a daze, he stumbled along with a stick. It was evening when the stars rose. Looking into the distance, the steep mountains were lush with trees. The tiger's lair was hidden in the thickets. Tired from being drunk, he drowsed on the mountain. The tiger brandished its claws and bared its fangs. Wu Song remembered the stick too hastily. The stick broke in mid-air in panic. Fortunately, he was as strong as an ox. The white-browed striped tiger was subdued in an instant. Therefore, Master Sheng sighs and comments well.</p>

Cool autumn after the rain. Sending you to the crossroads. Reluctant to leave, lingering and hesitant. Hoping you will return to the country and increase its glory soon. The shallow pond water. Waves flowing. We hold hands to watch the mandarin ducks. From now on, we will love each other. As close as lacquer and glue. Growing old together. Happiness is endless.</p>

<h3>Aspects of Life in "Song of a Loving Mother"</h3>
<p>Lin Chuchu, the loving mother in "Song of a Loving Mother", worked hard and diligently in her youth, raising her children, and devoted herself wholeheartedly. Even in her later years, although she was wandering around the world, homeless, she still maintained the happiness of her children everywhere, and was willing to sacrifice herself. That kind of ultimate love in the world once moved every audience who watched the screening to tears.</p>
<p>"Song of a Loving Mother" has Lin Chuchu, a kind and amiable loving mother, Hong Jingling, the cunning eldest son, Li Zhuozhuo and Gong Zhihua, the disobedient and unfilial evil daughters-in-law, Zhang Zhizhi, the stingy and greedy son-in-law, Zheng Junli, the selfish and self-interested second son, Li Lili, the hypocritical and ingratiating daughter, Zhang Yi, the third son who takes the blame for his father, Chen Yanyan, the virtuous and kind neighbor girl, and Han Langen, the fair and impartial village chief. There are detailed depictions of aspects of life.</p>
<p>Chinese people who are good at chanting and praying often wish people more children and grandchildren, because having many children and grandchildren is something to be proud of in a large family, but what is the experience of the loving mother in "Song of a Loving Mother", who also has many children?</p>
<p>"Children and grandchildren will have their own blessings, don't be cattle and horses for children and grandchildren." This is a very common saying, which is clearly revealed and painfully depicted in "Song of a Loving Mother".</p>
<h3>"Spring Comes to the World" Re-released Today</h3>
<p>Mr. Sun Yu's directorial works have a unique characteristic: they are rich in poetry, make people optimistic, and make audiences yearn for the brightness of humanity. This characteristic is particularly evident in "Spring Comes to the World."</p>
<p>This film stars Chen Yanyan and Mei Xi. Yanyan is gentle and timid because she is a maidservant to a very violent woman. Therefore, her life's dictionary only has the two words "crying." Occupying the balcony behind her house is a young boatman, Mei Xi, who is a cheerful person. He is always playing the flute under the moon and smiling in the sunlight. He hates Yanyan's crying, but in the end, he quietly falls in love with her.</p>
<p>The story takes place in Peach Blossom Village, which is full of blossoming trees and gently flowing spring water. This village has spent a desolate autumn and a cruel winter amid warlord civil wars, and finally, spring has arrived. "Spring Comes to the World" is such a poem full of symbolic meaning!</p>
<p>Spring has come. Due to audience demand, "Spring Comes to the World" has been decided to be given a special screening at the Xinguang Grand Theatre starting today, because "Spring Comes to the World" can allow the audience to receive a piece of pleasant spring!</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of "Crossroads"</h3>
<h3>Xinhua Snippets</h3>
<p>"Midnight Song" has been playing at the Jincheng Theater for three weeks, and the audience is still crowded, with no end in sight. The Xinhua authorities, in order to treat viewers who have watched it two or three times, have spared no expense to print six types of three-color stereoscopic "Midnight Song" stills, which will be distributed with tickets at the Jincheng starting this week.</p>
<p>The male lead of "Night Rain on the Xiaoxiang" was originally set to be Jin Shan, but due to Jin Shan's foot injury, which has not healed for some time, Gao Zhanfei has been re-hired to play the role. With Lao Gao's past reputation, there is no doubt that he will be able to take on the role with ease.</p>
<p>Wang Cilong is working on "Night Rain on the Xiaoxiang" to the point of almost forgetting to eat and sleep, while Diao Banhua is lingering in the studio, happily forgetting to return, because of her outstanding performance.</p>
<p>Since the start of filming of "Youth March," there have been very few NG shots, and the lead actors Hu Ping, Tong Yuejuan, and Shi Chao have received great praise from Shi Dongshan.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaozhong is currently working hard on the scene breakdown of the script for "Shanghai Bund Sixty Years Later," hiding at home all day, temporarily refusing to see guests.</p>
<p>The content of this issue of Xinhua Books and Newspapers is becoming increasingly rich. In addition to the original text and photos, which are still sixteen pages each, nine more pages of comics have been added, while the price remains only one dime.</p>
