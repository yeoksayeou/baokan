<h3>敵軍海陸空大舉反攻我軍迎頭痛擊各路勝利</h3>
<p>敵方昨已放棄東西兩司令部　巡洋艦潛水艇被我中彈炸燬　出雲艦昨受傷悄然移防</p>
<p>中日兩軍連日作戰之結果、敵以慘遭挫折、損失奇重、遂一面死守東區陣地、一面乞增援軍、希圖大舉反攻、故在久留米師團開到後、卽於昨晨起、集合海陸空軍、向我各處陣地、全力進犯、但我方早已準備、空陸兩軍、同時出動、予以迎頭痛擊、敵軍仍不得逞、受創綦鉅、狼狽潰退、且將江灣路與公大紗廠兩司令部放棄、我軍乘勝進逼、佔據虹口公園、敵軍陣綫、益陷絕境、乃向我吳淞及浦東方面、企圖登陸、然又未果、且被我砲燬巡洋艦兩隻、而我空軍又復在吳淞口外炸燬潛水艇一艘、日警察署及郵船會社、均被我投彈命中、且波及日本領事館、死傷敵方軍民頗衆、敵機昨雖全日出動、希圖對我破壞、亦經我空軍及高射砲所抑制、尤以主艦出雲、昨晚突破我口口炸傷、悄然移防、茲將昨日戰况詳情、分紀如下、</p>
<p>敵己放棄兩司令部</p>
<p>昨晨拂曉、我軍乘敵增援部隊陣地尚未穩固之際、各路同時進攻、槍砲密如雨點、我將士忠勇肉搏、有進無退、殘敵於頑抗優、各路不支潰退、八時十五分、滬東方面公大紗廠敵司令部中死守之將士、以無法支持、向後潰退、現以裕豐紗廠為根據地、圖再頑抗、我軍一面越過公大紗廠、向前推進、一面派隊抄査敵司令部、又引翔區方面、敵亦至河間路之南、虹口方面、我軍佔領虹口公園愛國女學育靑中學等處後、瞄凖北四川路底敵司令部轟擊、敵以勢力孤薄、被迫放棄、已退至狄思威路、以日本小學為根據地、又滬西方面、敵放棄豐田紗廠後、原以內外紗廠為根據地、昨亦已放棄、退至該廠以南、聞各路敵軍死亡約數百人、遺屍遍野、創傷甚巨、</p>
<p>又據確息、北四川路敵司令部、已移至狄思威路日本小學、惟該處尚留少數殘敵死守、我軍正包圍中、尚未佔領、</p>
<p>楊穚浦穚底軍工路之日商公大紗廠、原為敵軍東區根據地、連日經我右翼軍猛力攻擊、並由我空軍協助轟炸、敵軍傷亡甚重、全廠房屋、炸毀殆盡、該處所有敵軍、頗難掩蔽、故該廠敵軍、業於昨日下午二時許退出、殘敵已退往平涼路及楊樹浦方面云、</p>
<p>八字橋我出奇制勝</p>
<p>本報特訊、閘北八字橋、在戰事未爆發以前、原被敵軍一大隊所佔據、自開戰以後、我軍為求易於與滬東方面取得密切聯絡、寶山路方面取得呼應、以期三面包抄敵軍司令部起見、八字橋為必爭之地、非急速佔據該處陣地不可、故在十五日拂曉、已被我軍奪進、佔據該橋附近地帶、敵軍雖曾數度反攻、均被找擊退、昨日拂曉時、敵軍又集中砲甲車掩護步兵結集火力、向我陣地猛烈反攻、我軍立卽應戰、分兩路向敵軍陣地奇襲、兩方肉搏至兩小時之久、敵卒不支、倉皇潰退、我軍遂乘勝追擊、並將該地之日本小學校佔領、</p>
<p>昨晨拂曉、江灣路我軍接應寶山路八字橋部隊、向體育會路愛國女校附近敵軍猛攻、經四小時餘激戰、敵軍不支潰退、九時許該處陣地為我軍佔領、寶山路八字橋我軍、亦於是時進佔至天通庵車站前、故江灣路底之敵軍司令部及虹口公園內敵軍、已在我軍重重包圍中、敵司令部周圍建築、均為我軍砲毀、因該部建築堅固、墻壁圍有鋼板、故敵尚據而拒戰、傍晚時據某軍事機關消息、該處敵軍、已逐漸退往狄思威路方面、江灣路敵司令部、隨時可被我軍佔領云、</p>
<p>敵軍陣地將陷絕境</p>
<p>（本報特訊據某外國軍事專家發表觀察談、上海中日戰爭爆發後、華軍取大包圍形勢、有進無退、前途自頗樂觀、惟日軍已被逼成三角陣綫、卽東為公大紗席、北為江灣路司令部、南為出雲旗艦、而北路已受包圍、成為凸出點、（按陣地凸出、為戰略所最忌其最狹處、僅存步槍射程而已、尤有被華軍截斷之可能、南點出雲艦、僅作掩護東北兩綫、而並無抵抗力量、據此以觀、日軍似將陷於絕境、</p>
<p>我軍佔領虹口公園</p>
<p>江灣路我軍、昨（十六）晨以機關槍與步槍向敵軍陣地進攻、肉搏衝鋒、屢進屢退、卒於正午十二時、擊退殘敵、佔領虹口公園、愛國女校、育靑中學等處、現與敵司令部益為迫近、正相機進攻中、是夜敵傷亡百餘人、我亦稍有死傷、昨晨拂曉、我軍某部、奉令自水電路特志學院開出、向江灣路愛國女學前進、距愛國西北面約半里許、有一高樓、敵軍躍出抵抗、機槍齊發、來勢甚猛、我軍奮勇、當還以掃射、卒將敵軍擊退、並卽佔領愛國女學、而完成包圍敵陸戰隊司令部之計劃、自此向東、已與我軍取得連絡矣、</p>
<p>昨（十六）晨二時劇戰又起、敵對江灣方面企圖夜襲、曾以一大隊約三四百名藉其大砲掩護、向江灣進撲、當由我軍立卽奮起還擊、用機槍手溜彈等利器沉着應戰、並將敵全部包圍、鏖戰結果、此部敵兵、悉數被我殲滅、</p>
<p>廣東街獲敵二甲車</p>
<p>據關係方面發表、我軍左右翼、昨晨三時許、同時擊敗日軍、乘勝進攻、全軍將士、奮勇前進、頗為勝利、在廣東街方面、截獲敵鐵甲車二輛、</p>
<p>敵攻春江路被擊退</p>
<p>原駐公大第一紗廠之敵軍、於昨晨四時半退出之前、聯合駐在大康住宅方面之敵軍、向我春江路及馬玉山路方面陣地攻擊、當被我軍奮勇擊退、並乘勝進擊、敵軍死傷甚多、</p>
<p>敵軍圖襲北站被阻</p>
<p>昨日淸晨有日軍一隊、由北四川路靶子路向西、擬抄襲寶山路吾軍陣地、當經駐防靶子路北河南路一帶之美軍阻止、聞當時曾發生小冲突、日軍旋卽後退、始告無事、</p>
<p>敵軍企圖瀏河登岸</p>
<p>軍界息、日增援部隊業已於昨晨開抵淞口、因我空軍施行烈猛轟炸、予敵以重大威脅、故敵增援部隊、卒未能在租界區域內登岸、茲悉敵軍左面、現已變更戰略、决將增援部隊、開往楊林口瀏河江面、企圖襲一二八滬戰之故技、在彼處大舉進犯、攻我腹地、但我方早已知其譎謀、故防禦方面、早有凖備、俟其來犯、决卽一舉而殲滅之、</p>
<p>吳淞敵軍登陸未果</p>
<p>十六日晨時半停泊三峽水之日艦、乘天未黎明之際、有大批陸戰隊分載划船數十隻、希圖在吳淞外馬路市輪渡碼頭沿塘登陸、敵艦用大砲掩護、經我駐軍開放機關槍掃射、激戰一小時餘、敵未得逞、紛向口外潰退、其時我空軍已聞警趕到、遂飛往三峽水施行轟炸敵艦、亂放高射砲、復經我砲兵在岸上發砲助戰、一時砲聲隆隆、非常猛烈、至上午九時後、戰鬥漸告沉寂、吳淞東半鎮落有砲彈數枚、尚有居民六百餘人、急待救護、恐淞口海陸空大戰、從此展開、</p>
<p>敵援開到企圖反攻</p>
<p>確息第三艦隊司令長谷川、第十一艦隊司令谷本、前向東京乞援、昨日所開到久久米師團一部、卽係十三日由佐世保出發之兩師團、一部係在大阪碼頭登岸、加入作戰、其人數無確實估計故不知、我前綫現已陸續增厚大軍、嚴陣以待中云、</p>
<p>日艦砲轟市中心區</p>
<p>據昨乘某外輪抵滬之某外人談、渠於搭輪抵吳淞口後、卽換乘小輪、由武裝外警保衛駛進浦江、時為下午二時左右、沿途目擊吳淞口所推砌之石岸、共中五彈、閘北水電廠中二十餘彈、虬江碼頭中五彈、泊駐虬江碼頭之日艦四艘、正以重砲對凖市中心區市府一帶轟擊、</p>
<p>敵軍駐守華成大厦</p>
<p>據報匯山路大連灣路轉角華成烟草公司大厦、昨日（十六）下午三時、有日軍一隊開到、守門警巡阻止被擊斃、日軍已在該厦設部駐守、並在屋頂架高射砲、</p>
<p>兩路新屋受創頗重</p>
<p>日本此次在滬多方挑覺、戰端開始以來、由海陸空軍同時進攻、經三日之激戰、迄未得逞、乃襲一二八時之故技、專以大砲轟擊我陣地、並專事毀壞我文化機關、東區濱江之滬江大學、已被燬無餘、我在寶山路口之兩路局新屋、竣工未二年、造價達七十萬元、經敵方連日轟擊、被創甚重、</p>
<p>敵砲擊中英美烟廠</p>
<p>敵艦昨晨由浦江中、向浦東方面射擊、於五時半有砲彈兩枚擊中英美烟草公司工廠之鍋爐間、有相當損毀、同時有另外之兩敵艦、亦以砲口描凖、集中砲火、向該公司轟擊、</p>
<p>虬江碼頭日艦中砲</p>
<p>確息、十六日晨靠近虬江碼頭之敵艦七艘、向我陣地開出轟擊、經我報以巨砲、敵艦二艘當被命中、其中較大之巡洋艦一艘、因受傷已不能運動、另由二艦拖出、向吳淞洋面逃竄、</p>
<p>浦江日艦共廿九艘</p>
<p>停泊於浦江中之日本軍艦、截至昨日上午為止、共為卅六艘、昨日下午有七艘出口、開往瀏河、尚有廿九艘、分泊於下列各處、計吳淞口六艘、蘭路口浦江中二艘、（第一號）日本郵船公司碼頭、卽NYK）四艘、（第廿二號二艘十六號二艘另浮筒一只）匯山碼頭三艘、（第廿一號）、德士古碼頭三艘、上三井碼頭魚雷艦四艘、虬江碼頭四艘、（第廿三號）、魚市塲二艘、連泊於外白渡橋日領事館後之出雲艦、共為廿九艘、</p>
<p>萬衆注目轟炸出雲</p>
<p>昨晚九時許、忽有巨聲發自江面、響澈雲霄、聲震天地、外灘附近房屋、均被震動甚劇、事後調査、係我方放射某項爆炸物、轟炸敵艦出雲號、因該艦周圍設有防禦魚雷網、故未命中、頗為可惜、浦江敵艦、當時於倉皇忙亂中、用探海燈向我浦東方面探照、同時並紛紛開砲轟擊浦東我軍陣地、我軍亦以重砲及機關槍還擊、雙方激戰、頗為猛然、至十時三十分、砲聲更密、屋瓦為震、機關槍聲、密如聯珠、砲火之光、宛如閃電、如是者約十分鐘、十時三刻、砲聲稍停、十一時後漸趨沉寂、</p>
<p>又據中央社云、停泊浦江指揮敵軍作戰之敵出雲旗艦、昨晨十一時半、被我轟炸機投彈受傷、下午八時半於砲火猛烈中、又被我某項爆炸軍器擊中船身一部、負傷極重、敵急加修理、旋於十一時向下游移泊公和祥碼頭江心、</p>
<p>中央社十七日晨二時報告、敵出雲旗艦、被我某項爆炸軍器擊中船尾受重傷、當時目擊之中外人士、均鼓掌稱快、該艦曾向下游開去、</p>
<h3>昨日移走之出雲旗艦</h3>
<p>昨晚發生猛烈砲戰</p>
<p>（中央社）昨晚七時起、我軍□□及□□兩方砲兵陣地、向敵軍楊樹浦百老匯路一帶陣地轟擊、砲火異常猛烈、敵軍艦亦發砲還擊、記者踞高樓瞭望、但見閃光起處、火丸如電、來回飛馳、雜以重機開鎗、似敵軍由高橋射下者、其紅色之彈丸、發如聯珠、一時砲聲隆隆、槍聲軋軋、租界房屋亦為震動、旋於八時許砲聲稍行沉寂、約十數分鐘砲聲又起、敵軍企圖在浦登登岸、被我軍奮勇擊退、北四川路底某處、被我擊中着火、約廿分鐘熄滅、其後槍砲之聲移至東面、蓋我□□方面砲兵、亦加入攻擊、約於十時許停止、其後僅有疏落之機槍聲、至深夜十二時全綫卽告沉寂、</p>
<p>敵昨退定海路一帶</p>
<p>據官方報告、昨日中日激戰結果如下、㊀公大一廠之日軍已退定海路、妾康社日軍已退寗國路河間路、六三花園附近之日本啤酒廠日軍亦被我軍驅走、㊁浦東敵人除兩個碼頭外、其餘敵人已完全退出、㊂昨日南京空軍戰鬥結果、我空軍擊落敵機十一架、但日軍祇承認七架㊃東京陸軍方面電駐滬海軍、要求再維持兩天、㊄黃浦江內、現有敵艦三十餘艘、敵飛機定今明兩日、將大肆活動、</p>
<p>中央社云、據由戰區逃出之難民報告楊樹浦大阪黃浦及匯山等各碼頭、連日經我空軍數度轟炸、破壞無遺云、（中央社）</p>
<p>中央社云、據確悉、敵軍之高射砲、以虹口公園、公大第一紗廠及虬江碼頭以南一帶所泊之日艦爲最多、北四川路之永豐大樓及虹口各高大之商房、亦均裝放高射砲云、</p>
<p>中央社云、敵機多架昨晨九时許、飛至引　　以北一带投彈甚多、均落荒郊、我方並無損害、旋經我驅逐機飛往攻擊、卽行逃逸云、</p>
<h3>我空軍大施轟炸敵潛艇中彈焚燬</h3>
<p>出雲艦日領署亦受重創　日碼頭被炸死傷數十人</p>
<p>昨日再度發生激烈空戰、淸晨五時許、敵水上機卽出動、有兩架飛龍華投彈、幸未爆炸、旋至南市及南站等處偵察、並用機槍掃射、擊斃無辜路人數名、我軍亦出動應戰、於七時九時及十時、三次在浦江上空與敵艦激戰、十一時半、我轟炸機七架、在出雲旗艦上空盤旋翱翔、敵艦及租界日領館日商店各屋頂高射砲同時齊發、我機沈着盤旋、毫不退却、其中架、突由高空疾駛而下、投擲重彈一枚、落於離出雲艦旁廿餘尺之蓬路百老匯路日郵船碼頭、據目擊者談、當時轟然一聲、黑烟上衝、碼頭上日軍及浪人數十名、漢奸六名、白俄二名、均被擊斃、炸彈碎片四飛、出雲艦受重傷附近日警署亦被炸燬、至正午空戰暫停、下午二時我機數架又飛吳松口外、擊沉日潛水艇一艘、並焚燬敵小型艦兩艘、三時半浦江上空、又起激戰、我機與敵機互用機槍掃射、敵艦亦鳴砲助戰、惟均無損傷、至七時許告停止、</p>
<p>擲彈一枚燬日警署</p>
<p>昨日上午十一時半許、我國空軍一隊、曾再度飛往浦江蘇州河口、希圖轟炸日領館及駐泊浦江之敵旗艦出雲號、當時敵艦上高射砲及機關槍、雖向我機掃射、但我國空軍毫不畏怯、當有一機、忽由蘇州河口上空疾飛而下、擲下巨彈一枚、轟然一聲、全市震動、據事後調査、該彈落於進老匯路南潯路附近、馬路炸成丈餘見方深約六尺之大窟窿、當卽炸燬日本警署及郵船會社一部份、而日領事館亦有一角燬壞、死傷日軍民數十人、日領事館遭此懲創後、不敢再事留內辦公云、</p>
<p>猛投炸彈燬敵潛艇</p>
<p>我轟炸機數架、昨（十六）日下午二時飛吳淞口外與敵艦戰鬥、在敵艦猛烈砲火下、投擲炸彈十枚、射擊奇凖、有七枚擊中敵潛水艇、當卽擊燬起火、敵小型艦兩艘、趕往施救、亦着火焚燒、至四時許火尚未熄、找機於完成任務後、卽安然飛回、</p>
<p>午後四時許、天空白雲片片、我空軍復利用時機、派出飛機十餘架、分隊擾亂敵艦、及向楊樹浦敵軍陣地投彈、先後不下十餘次、敵艦每見我機、倉皇應戰、而我空軍雖被敵軍高射砲包圍之下、活躍依然、聞停泊吳淞口及蘊藻浜浦江中之敵艦、有兩艦被炸受損、其中一艦、因傷重沉沒云、</p>
<p>敵司令部爆炸延燒</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>維持上海治安之兩大問題</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>失業問題與民食問題</p>
<p>自滬市淪為戰區。全市人民負箱携籠扶老挈幼。均向認為比較安全之蘇州河以南。民國路徐家匯以北及中山路以東之一區域內。為其生命財產寄托之所。卽各國僑民之生命財產亦興我國人同其運命。因之以一時的人口密集。不但住宿問題。驟感不足。卽一切生活必需品之供求。亦失其調劑之功。物價貴。有求無應。加以奸商乘機居奇。抬價勒索。於是而有發生搶却店铺之事。雖為奸商自取其咎然與地方治安影響實大及戰事旣作財政部為安定金融起見。復命本市銀錢業停業兩天至昨日（十五日）已頌有非常時期安定金融辦法七條限制提存宜可復業又以戰事劇烈銀錢業須另覓安全地帶營業之故重歸停頓。滬上工商業因金融失其週轉。無法營業。而停閉者愈多。失業者愈衆。又以一人失業。而一家失所生者。復不知盈千累萬。此𣅜地方治安之隱憂也。夫以上海生活之昂貴薪工之低廉各人負担之重大日常開支之外能有積蓄以備不時之需者有幾時至今日。旣不能使人人有業然而减少失業之人數。固為應有之舉且銀錢業停業愈久地方之損失亦愈重大人心愈形不安。故㊀金融業宜尅日復業卽使鄰近危臉區域而有所顧盧亦應早覓安全（？）地帶營業㊁銀錢業對於安定金融辦法認為尚應有補充之處。亦當早日决定㊂工商業應卽與金融業取得深切之聯絡接濟。俾得復業。卽使營業淸淡。亦須竭力設法維持職工最低之生活。以减輕失業問題之嚴重性。㊃其有不能留在上海者。應設法聯絡交通機關。及用全市市政機關之力。出以最安全有組織之方法。分投由水陸遣回原籍。無使流離於上海。總之。使上海失業人數。能少一人。卽上海之治安多得一分助力此其一</p>
<p>“飢寒起盜心。”人之鋌而走險。除絕少數外當非所願。乃自滬事發作一時糧價飛漲。人心惶惶。若有不可終日之狀者。此其故何歟。不久以前。報章所見。僉以為上海卽使有戰事民食可無虞。吾人嘗以為疑蓋上海每逢風雨之天。斛開稍稀。米價尚且上騰何况戰事發生。人人抱有戰事持久之見。有力之家預為積儲。貧苦小民粒食維艱在此種不均之狀態下。易於引起不安何况糧商乘機操縱。囤積居奇。不顧民食之艱難。而以為閉戶固拒。可以無虞。及饑民蠭擁而入。有何益哉。要知今日之現狀。非為糧食之缺乏。而為調節之不勻。管理之不周。早先本報根據調查上海各棧存米四十五萬餘包。有責者均侈然自慰。以為糧食充裕之明證。記者籍以為慮。蓋見所存之米。均分儲於浦東西洋棧中。設一旦浦江運輸阻絕。如何接濟。則有米將與無米若。至皖贛米價之為如何如何。更遠水救不得近火。與目前上海之民食無涉。蓋今日滬上市民所魚需者。為如何解决目前及以後之民食問題應從事實覓辦法。非空談所龍有濟也。</p>
<p>簡直言之。㊀上海今日之民食問題。乃整個問題。故應由市政府及兩租界當局。各公團共同負責在有組織之機構下。協力應付之。㊁先儘上海之存糧。邀集當業者作精密之調查統計設法從各堆機中取出。分儲於較安全便於分配之塲所。㊂切實取締糧商抬價。將糧食行市之評定。置於公同管理之下。㊃就全市分為若干處所。辦理平繼。以維持升斗小民之食糧。其處所宜多。㊄設法保護米商或運滬米船。或竟由公家備款直接向各產地採辦運滬接濟。㊅勸導各民戶商店無多儲食糧。宜各具同舟共濟之熱忱。要使大衆能得食。而後己之食可保。㊆嚴禁各米店閉門拒耀。但不妨曁由公家限定每人購米之數量。其升斗價格。仍當公正。㊆前聞傳言某某兩局均購有客米。如或原欲為調節之用者。宜卽時出售㊈今日之民食病在運輸斷絕。調節不勻。糧食運銷局在此國難時期。宜負起全責亟應從糧食運銷上解决上海民食之困難。㊉調查全滬食品製造之廠所設備生產能力及工入人數。以備萬一危急時製造食品之用。</p>
<p>以上所陳祇其大要。籍以為保持上海之治安。及持久作戰之企圖。其重要固無有過於此者。蓋上海為各國僑民薈萃之所。又為擁有人口最多之商埠。其情形自有異於各地也。</p>
<h3>我駐德大使館申明滬租界落彈轟炸原因</h3>
<p>並稱日本利用租界作戰　以致中國預防計劃破壞</p>
<p>［柏林］此聞中國大使館、對於上海公共租界被炸事件、發表下列申明謂、“日本不顧一九三二年停戰恊定、運到大批軍隊後、中國在上海方面、不得已採取各種防禦辦法、日本海軍陸戰隊從公共租界北部侵入閘北、向警備部隊開槍、上海市長俞鴻鈞當向日本駐滬總領事提出抗議、但其答覆方式、乃繼續攻擊、中國軍隊、遂迫不得已起而自衛、中國採取此種辦法時、總在可能範圍內、竭力保護上海外僑之安全、不幸事伴發生、外僑數人、竟權於難、殊堪惋惜、查公共租界落彈轟炸之原因、乃由於一中國飛行師在空戰時身負重傷、彈架損壞、故炸彈無法控制、自動遺落、死傷多數中國人中、有少數外僑、中國政府、甚表遺憾、希望此等非人力所能控制之非常不幸事件、以後將不再發生、</p>
<p>中國空軍、因日本大量飛機及兵艦之庸集、為自衛計、故有出動必要、中國政府極愿避免戰爭影響及公共租界、但日軍則憑藉租界為根據地、在中國主權下之領土作大規模之攻擊、故中國不波及租界之計劃、已為日方所破壞、但中國仍竭力採取所有預防步驟、凡日軍不用作根據之租界、决不波及、據吾輩探悉、現有日機一百架、集中上海附近、準備轟炸京滬沿纖各城鎭、如上海·唯亭·均已被炸·日本顧然欲以破壞中國經濟中心之方法、强迫中國接受無理要求、但中國則已决定抵抗到底”云（十五日國民軍</p>
<p>［華盛頓］中國駐美大使王正　、今日對於上海戰事轟炸波及平民事、表示遺憾、並稱、此項平氏實屬防衛民主主權、與不知饜足之日本軍國主義之抗戰中犧牲品云、王氏並稱、自蘆溝橋事變發生以來、中國政府已屢加隱忍、惟日本之利用飛機、在中國各地施處、已不知著干次、非但戰區受其荼毒、卽平民及敎育文化機關、被其摧殘、最近復造成上海事變、則為日本企圖再造成一二八事件、以期破壞中國經濟財政之中心點云、（中央社十五日路透電）</p>

<h3>本報記者最前線視察紀</h3>
<p>士兵四畫夜中未獲休息　某軍官談勝利片段經過</p>
<p>本報記者於昨晨雙方空戰激烈的時候、特往江灣閘北最前綫視寧、汽申越過公共租界鐵椆到達我軍防地、便感覺到種莊嚴穆肅、神聖不可侵犯的空氣、精神的興奮、亦昇到沸點便副武裝的我軍忠勇兵士、胸前掛着五六個手溜彈身材雖不十分高大、却個個活潑勇敢年齡都在二十歲左右、在和藹可親的談吐中、顯出凜然不屈的神情、汽車曲折向前方開進防禦工事方面、亦逐步加緊、沿途零零落落還有些逃難民衆、但是大部份依舊很鎮定的住在戰區火綫裹、婦女們抱着孩子、很自然地在街上散步、者百姓簇簇地在圍着談天、這訓安靜的現象、一方面可以暗示前方戰事的勝利、另一方面可以看出軍民打成片的事實、和後方民衆的沉着鎭靜行行重行、行一步步逼近館綫、槍砲聲也逐漸密集起來、小鋼砲和迫擊砲聲更震動耳鼓、將到最前綫一百米突的時候、子彈嗤嗤從頂上飛過、連忙蹲下身子沿着墻跟走、起初不覺有些害怕、後來也處之泰然、在第一道防綫戰壕中的我軍忠勇士兵最多齣、已有四畫夜未曾合過眼睛、眼中放出一道道紅光釘住在對過敵人陣綫、瘋狂似的靜待殺敵、他們全身都是淤泥、也分辨不出面目手足來、記者含着不知道是甜是酸的眼淚默然向他們致無限的敬意、匆匆告別、跑到距離稍遠的地方找到了幾個高級長官、暢談殺敵的經過、大家眉飛色舞、眞有說不出的愉怏、這詩門外抬進幾位受傷的我忠勇兵士來、記者連忙跑過去、握住他們熱度很高的手、表示深切的慰問、他們在微微呻吟聲中、頷首感謝、記奢也就辭了出來、坐上汽車、在車輪風馳電掣展動中、前綫所見的情景、便一一湧上心頭、覺得狀們後方民衆、太沒有盡保國的責任、對於拼命殺敵捨身衛國的前綫忠勇將士祇有一百二十分的抱歉和惶愧、</p>
<p>記者在前綫和一位靑年軍官談了十分鐘的話、他正是昨晨四時率領隊伍圍攻愛國女學附近一帶的敵軍、關於作戰情形、約略說了一些、……我們奉令自持志大學出發、天還沒亮透快步向前、起初未見敵蹤、將到愛國女學的西北面、敵人機槍密集的射出、我們一個個匐伏而行、遇了一陣子、齊聲喊殺、奮勇追趕、他們便後退了、約莫半里路、敵退據高樓裹面預伏敵軍數十、又是機槍掃射、烟熖迷漫、正好作我們掩護、這時我隊也用密集砲火對付、把樓下的敵人、掃個精光、樓上的見勢不佳、紛紛從後窗跳下、傷的傷、逃的逃、我軍不再窮追、連忙進入搜索、奪獲彈藥不少、這時旭日東升、大家才定了神、這座樓四面皆窗、近處並無高大建築、遠遠可望出數百米達、作為臨時碉樓、居高臨下、在形勢再好沒有、等我們佈置完了之後派隊至愛國女學搜查、裹頭不見敵人、而我援軍已陸續開到、包圍日軍陸戰隊司令部的計劃、總算告成了、……”</p>
<p>這位軍官的談鋒甚健、隨後又說、“當此最後關頭、我們只知為生存而戰、為公理而戰、為捍衛彊土而戰、生命可以犧牲、還留戀着什麼、所以‘八一三’的前一天我軍奉令開滬應戰、那一個不是精神抖擻、奮勇當先、深知我們的政府，有整個的計劃我們的將士、具最後的决心世望我們的同胞、一心一德奮鬪到底、勝利一定是我們的”、說時態度激昂、意志堅强、不愧為國軍中的後起之秀、</p>
<p>我還得報告讀者、他是遼寗省人、是無家可歸的志士、早先在同濟大學讀書後來轉入北平輔仁大學三年級、又升中央軍校，今年畢業、入伍三個月呢</p>

<h3>抗戰聲中後方情緒的一斑一（一）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員賡雅</p>
<p>翻身的日子</p>
<p>“我們翻身的日子快到了吧！”</p>
<p>這是我當局因盧溝橋事變宣告了抗戰決心以後，記者適從天南的昆明，取道川鄂等省返滬，在各地聽取得的”句“異口同聲”的流行語。</p>
<p>這裹所謂“翻身的日子，”雖然還是一種希望，但徵諸各方有利於我的輿論和事象，尤其是由教後方“眾志成城，”蓬蓬勃勃，好像立刻就要放出一朵民族解放自由之花似的民氣看來，這樣的希望，並不是沒有什麼把握的。</p>
<p>我們本來也知道的，虎視在我們面前的猙獰惡魔，便是敵人饕餮無恥的陰謀，以及發揮獸性一般的攻掠。然而我們用不着發情，也勿須多所態慮。我們更要認識我們本身所只有的偉大力量，即四萬五千萬、民眾彈藥袋裹所有的彈葉，和人人早已貯成飽和狀態的滿腔熱血，祇要我們能發動廣大的持久的全民抗戰，那末，這直接危害中國民族生命，間接摧毀世界和平幸福的惡魔，到了最後的結局，必然的會受到無從挽救的嚴重教訓，而自食其兵凶戰危不戰自焚的惡果。</p>
<p>而今，全民抗戰的序幕，已在一種“忍無可忿”的情勢之下，毅然决然地展開了。在前綫上的英勇軍兒，他們斬將牽旗，殺敵致果的戰訊，也不斷地由報章傳送來了。不過，與前方如此悲壯激烈的士氣，互有表裹相應的關係之後方民氣，究竟激昂到如何的程度？可以發生怎樣的效用？這當然也是值得注意的重大問題。</p>
<p>本文之作，就是想在這方面多介紹一點實際資料。對於此次全民抗戰，後方陣容的檢討，或不無舉一反三”之貢獻。</p>
<p>天南的昆明</p>
<p>先說此行出發地的昆明吧：那里原在南國的極邊，與華北相隔萬里之遙。假使說華北是目前的最前綫，雲南便是目前的最後方。但是雲南地區雖則處於最後方，一般人屢次為國難所激起的熱烈情緒，向來并不稍讓於前方。特別是這次盧溝橋事變剛爆發，一經當地報紙號外披露，輾轉相傳，不到多少時候，整個的昆朋市，便被悲憤激昂的空氣籠罩了！第二天，募捐勞軍呀，自動貢獻一日所得呀，加繁公務員及學生軍訓呀，這些都是風起雲湧的事實。</p>
<p>同時，市面上有幾家兼賣仇製絲麻織品的商店，以及賣“胃活‘仨丹’臭虫藥紛”“東洋玩具”一類零星仇貸的攤肆，都先後發現一宗一天賜黃金”樣的禮品，它不是警告書，也不是炸彈，而是極易潑洒揮發的人糞罐頭”。當之者，誠有“却之無從，受之有愧”之慨。</p>
<p>有些青年学生已自動分頭下榔去做宣傳工作。烏家塲（在市南二十里）砲兵團長梁默忱氏，還看見一個體軀昂藏，聲音宏亮的青年，在個墳壩上，對無數的墳墓演講，禮儀稱謂，一如會埸，惹得許多鄉人，把他左右及後方包圍成一個大弧形，梁初見時，認為他有神經病，但片斷的聽見他講述到“敵國推行南進政策，雲南便無從倖免”的話，才斷定他是一位熱血青年·那青年宣傳國難的技術，得當與否？我們可置之不論，不過雲南青年對國難的重視，却此可見一斑了。</p>
<p>可是後方應付國難的方法，僅憑上述的幾種社會事象，當然是萬萬不夠的。雲南政府方面的應付情形，又是如何呢？這當然更是題中應有的文字。</p>
<p>我誌為在大戰開始期間，後方當局的最大責任，概括起來，約有兩項：㊀盡量供給前方物力及人力，㊁努力維持當地的治安。雲南物產豐富，尚可維持“自足自給”的狀態。甘省內一切軍政大權，集中在省主席兼綏靖主任龍志舟氏一人之手，舉凡庶政練軍，令出有效，無不綱舉目張，成績可觀。記者曾數晤龍氏，他對於中日問題的看法，認為遲早終不免出於一戰。日本雖是强國，但中國祇要能作持久戰，縱用盡所有物力人力，也在所不惜。等鏖戰到相當的程度，使對方戰鬥力，消耗殆盡，最後勝利，終歸於我。不過當此民族存亡緊急關頭，地無論遠近，人無論老幼，都應傾其所有，以貢獻於國家，才能充實持久抗戰的力量。</p>
<p>此外，我在將離開昆明的頭一天，在安寗的“天下第一湯”，還訪晤着龍氏左右臂現任省委的盧水恒先生，他又說：雲南與英法屬地昆連，差幸相安無事。所有正規軍若干萬，隨時都在秣馬厲兵，準備效命抗戰疆埸。祇要中央調用的命令，早上來到，晚間即可動員北上。至於本省治安責任，，令各縣常備團隊担負，即保無虞。嗣又訪晤總參謀長廖品卓，師長張雲鵬詻氏，更知道滇省一般軍人所抱熊度，都與龍盧兩氏所談旨趣，密切脗合。記者從旁觀察，鑒於滇省近年實行徴兵，嚴格訓練，二年期滿退伍，仍得補助團隊，維持各地治安。加以連年未見災祲，稻禾豐收，一般社會經濟，比較尚呈小康狀熊。以故，上述當局願傾全省人力物力言共赴國難云云，確是由衷之，，負責之談也。</p>

<h3>Enemy's Sea, Land, and Air Forces Launch Major Counter-Offensive; Our Forces Meet Them Head-On, Achieving Victories on All Fronts</h3>
<p>The enemy abandoned both East and West Command Headquarters yesterday. Cruisers and submarines were hit and destroyed by our fire. The Izumo warship was damaged yesterday and quietly redeployed.</p>
<p>As a result of continuous battles between Chinese and Japanese armies, the enemy suffered a disastrous defeat and heavy losses. They resorted to fiercely defending the eastern district's positions while requesting reinforcements, hoping to launch a major counter-offensive. Therefore, after the Kurume Division arrived, they mobilized their sea, land, and air forces yesterday morning to launch a full-scale attack on our various positions. However, our side was well-prepared, and both air and ground forces were dispatched simultaneously to meet them head-on with a severe blow. The enemy forces still failed, suffered significant damage, and retreated in disarray. They also abandoned the Jiangwan Road and Gonda Cotton Mill command headquarters. Our army seized the opportunity to advance and occupied Hongkou Park. The enemy's frontline fell into an increasingly desperate situation, attempting to land in the Wusong and Pudong areas. However, this attempt was unsuccessful, and two cruisers were destroyed by our artillery fire. Furthermore, our air force destroyed a submarine outside the Wusongkou area. The Japanese police station and the postal company were also hit by our bombs, affecting the Japanese consulate and causing numerous casualties among enemy soldiers and civilians. Although enemy planes were dispatched throughout the day yesterday, hoping to cause damage to our side, they were suppressed by our air force and anti-aircraft guns. In particular, the flagship Izumo was damaged last night after breaking through our (censored) and quietly redeployed. The details of yesterday's battle situation are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>The Enemy Has Abandoned Two Command Headquarters</p>
<p>At dawn yesterday, while the enemy's reinforcement forces had not yet solidified their positions, our forces launched simultaneous attacks from all directions. Gunfire and artillery shells rained down like raindrops. Our soldiers fought bravely with bayonets, advancing without retreating. The remaining enemy resisted stubbornly, but all sides were unable to withstand the attacks and collapsed. At 8:15 AM, the soldiers desperately defending the enemy's headquarters at the Gonda Cotton Mill in the eastern part of Shanghai could not hold on and retreated. They are now using the Yu Feng Cotton Mill as a base, planning to resist again. Our army crossed the Gonda Cotton Mill, advancing forward, and dispatched teams to search the enemy's headquarters. In the Yinxiang District, the enemy had reached the south of Hejian Road. In Hongkou, after our army occupied Hongkou Park, the Patriotic Girls' School, and Yu Qing Middle School, they aimed and bombarded the enemy's headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. The enemy, with its forces isolated and weak, was forced to abandon it and retreat to Dixiwei Road, using the Japanese elementary school as a base. In the western part of Shanghai, after the enemy abandoned the Toyota Cotton Mill, they originally used the Inner and Outer Cotton Mills as a base. Yesterday, they also abandoned this and retreated south of the factory. It is reported that the enemy's death toll on all fronts was about several hundred, with corpses scattered everywhere and heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to reliable information, the enemy's headquarters on North Sichuan Road has moved to the Japanese elementary school on Dixiwei Road. However, a small number of remaining enemy soldiers are still desperately defending the area, and our army is currently surrounding it but has not yet occupied it.</p>
<p>The Japanese-owned Gonda Cotton Mill, located at the end of Yangshupu Bridge's Jungong Road, was originally the enemy's eastern district base. It has been under relentless attack by our right-wing army for days, with bombing assistance from our air force. The enemy's casualties have been heavy, and almost all the factory buildings have been destroyed. It is difficult for the enemy forces there to find cover. Therefore, the enemy forces at the factory withdrew around 2:00 PM yesterday, and the remaining enemy retreated to Pingliang Road and Yangshupu, it is said.</p>
<p>We Achieved a Surprise Victory at Bazihqiao</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Before the outbreak of the war, Bazihqiao in Zhabei was originally occupied by a large enemy detachment. Since the start of the war, our army, in order to easily establish close contact with the eastern part of Shanghai and to coordinate with the Baoshan Road area, with the aim of encircling the enemy's headquarters from three sides, Bazihqiao became a must-seize location. It was necessary to quickly occupy the position. Therefore, at dawn on the 15th, our army had already captured it and occupied the area near the bridge. Although the enemy had counterattacked several times, they were all repelled. At dawn yesterday, the enemy again concentrated armored vehicles to cover infantry and gathered firepower to launch a fierce counterattack on our position. Our army immediately responded and launched a surprise attack on the enemy's position from two directions. The two sides engaged in a bayonet fight for two hours. The enemy finally collapsed and retreated in panic. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue and occupied the Japanese elementary school in the area.</p>
<p>At dawn yesterday, our army on Jiangwan Road, coordinating with the troops on Baoshan Road and Bazihqiao, launched a fierce attack on the enemy near the Sports Association Road and the Patriotic Girls' School. After more than four hours of fierce fighting, the enemy collapsed and retreated. Around 9:00 AM, our army occupied the position. Our army on Baoshan Road and Bazihqiao also advanced to the front of the Tiantong'an Railway Station at that time. Therefore, the enemy's headquarters at the end of Jiangwan Road and the enemy in Hongkou Park were heavily surrounded by our army. The buildings surrounding the enemy's headquarters were all destroyed by our artillery fire. Because the building was sturdy and the walls were surrounded by steel plates, the enemy still occupied and resisted. According to a military source in the evening, the enemy forces there gradually retreated to the Dixiwei Road area, and the enemy's headquarters on Jiangwan Road could be occupied by our army at any time, it is said.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Position is About to Fall into a Desperate Situation</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) According to observations published by a foreign military expert, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in Shanghai, the Chinese army adopted a large encirclement strategy, advancing without retreating. The future is quite optimistic. However, the Japanese army has been forced into a triangular front, with the Gonda Cotton Mill in the east, the Jiangwan Road headquarters in the north, and the Izumo flagship in the south. The northern route has been surrounded, becoming a protruding point. (Note: A protruding position is most dreaded in strategy. Its narrowest point is only the range of a rifle, and there is a possibility of being cut off by the Chinese army.) The southern point, the Izumo flagship, only serves to cover the northeast lines and has no resistance. Judging from this, the Japanese army seems to be in a desperate situation.</p>
<p>Our Army Occupied Hongkou Park</p>
<p>Yesterday (16th) morning, our army on Jiangwan Road attacked the enemy's position with machine guns and rifles, charging repeatedly. At noon, they defeated the remaining enemy and occupied Hongkou Park, the Patriotic Girls' School, Yu Qing Middle School, and other places. They are now approaching the enemy's headquarters and are opportunistically attacking. On that night, the enemy suffered more than a hundred casualties, and we also suffered some casualties. At dawn yesterday morning, a certain unit of our army, under orders, set out from the Special Vocational College on Shuidaian Road and advanced towards the Patriotic Girls' School on Jiangwan Road. About half a li northwest of the Patriotic Girls' School, there was a tall building. The enemy jumped out to resist, firing machine guns in a fierce attack. Our army fought bravely and returned fire, finally repelling the enemy and occupying the Patriotic Girls' School, completing the plan to encircle the enemy's Marine Corps headquarters. From here eastward, contact has been made with our army.</p>
<p>Yesterday (16th) at 2:00 AM, fierce fighting broke out again. The enemy attempted a night attack on the Jiangwan area, using a large detachment of about three to four hundred men, under the cover of their artillery. Our army immediately rose up to fight back, using machine guns and grenades to calmly respond. They surrounded the entire enemy force. As a result of the fierce battle, all the enemy soldiers in this unit were annihilated by us.</p>
<p>Two Armored Vehicles Captured on Guangdong Street</p>
<p>According to sources, our army's left and right wings simultaneously defeated the Japanese army around 3:00 AM yesterday, taking advantage of the victory to advance. The entire army's soldiers fought bravely, achieving a significant victory. On the Guangdong Street front, two enemy armored vehicles were captured.</p>
<p>Enemy Attack on Chunjiang Road Repelled</p>
<p>Before withdrawing from the Gonda First Cotton Mill at 4:30 AM yesterday, the enemy forces stationed there joined forces with the enemy forces stationed in the Dakang residential area to attack our positions on Chunjiang Road and Mayushan Road.

It is reported that there was a minor conflict at the time, and the Japanese army retreated immediately, resolving the situation.</p>
<p>Enemy Attempts to Land at Liuhe</p>
<p>Military sources say that Japanese reinforcements arrived at Songkou yesterday morning. Because our air force carried out fierce and intense bombings, posing a major threat to the enemy, the enemy's reinforcements ultimately failed to land in the concession area. It is now known that the enemy's left wing has changed its strategy, deciding to send reinforcements to the Yanglinkou and Liuhe Jiangmian areas, attempting to repeat the old trick of the January 28th Shanghai War, launching a large-scale attack there to attack our hinterland. However, our side was already aware of their treacherous plot, so the defense was prepared early. Once they attack, we will resolutely annihilate them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Enemy Landing at Wusong Unsuccessful</p>

The enemy warships used artillery to cover them. After our stationed troops opened fire with machine guns, a fierce battle ensued for more than an hour. The enemy failed and retreated towards the sea. At that time, our air force had arrived after hearing the alarm, so they flew to the Sanxia Water to bomb the enemy warships, firing anti-aircraft guns indiscriminately. Our artillery also fired from the shore to assist in the battle. The sound of artillery was deafening and extremely fierce. After 9:00 AM, the fighting gradually subsided. Several artillery shells landed in the eastern half of Wusong Town, and more than 600 residents were in urgent need of rescue. It is feared that a large-scale sea, land, and air battle will unfold at Songkou from now on.</p>
<p>Enemy Reinforcements Arrived, Attempting to Counterattack</p>
<p>Reliable sources say that the Third Fleet Commander Hasegawa and the Eleventh Fleet Commander Tanemoto had requested reinforcements from Tokyo.

<p>Lianglu's New House Suffered Heavy Damage</p>
<p>Japan has provoked on many sides in Shanghai this time. Since the start of the war, they have launched simultaneous attacks by sea, land, and air, and have not succeeded after three days of fierce fighting. They have adopted the old trick of the January 28th Incident, specializing in bombarding our positions with artillery and destroying our cultural institutions. The Hujiang University in Binjiang, the eastern district, has been completely destroyed. Our new house of Lianglu Bureau at the intersection of Baoshan Road, which was completed less than two years ago and cost 700,000 yuan, has been severely damaged by the enemy's bombardment in recent days.</p>

After investigation, it was our side who launched a certain explosive device to bomb the enemy warship Izumo. Because the ship was surrounded by defensive torpedo nets, it was not hit, which is a pity. At that time, the enemy warships in the Huangpu River, in a panic, used sea searchlights to illuminate our Pudong area. At the same time, they fired artillery shells at our army's position in Pudong. Our army also returned fire with heavy artillery and machine guns. The fierce battle between the two sides was quite intense.

<p>[Nanjing] Today, enemy planes attacked five times throughout the day. The first time was at 6:00 AM. At that time, our side had already received the alert. The capital's police and defense forces immediately mobilized and were on guard in all directions. Based on their experience, they were unusually calm and quick in their actions. At the same time, our air force also mobilized and attacked the enemy planes in the suburbs. An aerial battle took place in the suburbs of the capital. Before long, the enemy planes were unable to withstand the attack and retreated. They returned shortly after, but were ultimately unsuccessful. Until noon, the enemy planes launched a full-scale attack, but were still heavily damaged by our air force and fled in panic. The capital city remained tranquil throughout. Even when the enemy planes attacked most fiercely, residents in the city only faintly heard the sound of our army's anti-aircraft guns from the suburbs. In the evening, confirmed reports were received from various locations, indicating that a total of five enemy planes had been destroyed by our air force and had fallen in Jurong, Yangzhou, Suzhou, Yixing, and Danyang. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] On the 16th, Japanese planes attempted to attack the capital four more times, but were repelled midway by our air force. A total of eight enemy planes were shot down in Jurong and other places. The first time was at 8:40 AM. Upon receiving the report, our army immediately dispatched planes to engage the enemy.

Determined to prevent the enemy planes from reaching the skies above the capital, our side dispatched many planes to patrol around Nanjing. The enemy, having had more than twenty of their bombers destroyed by us in recent days, were timid and fearful. Upon seeing our large forces engaging, they scattered in confusion and retreated. The last time was at 3:10 PM, when many enemy fighter planes were spotted attacking from the southeast of Nanjing.

At the same time, a large number of our country's air force mobilized and responded calmly. The fighting between the two sides was very fierce. Under the attack from all sides, the enemy planes were unable to withstand it and were shot down by our army in succession, totaling six planes. Three fell in Jurong, two of which have been destroyed, two in Yangzhou, and one in Zhenjiang. According to another report, a total of ten planes were shot down. Nanjing has been extremely strict with air defense preparations, so enemy planes have repeatedly tried to bomb the city but have ultimately failed. The air raid alarm was in effect from 5:30 AM until 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters</h3>
<p>Hidemasa's Withdrawal Does Not Mean Severing Diplomatic Relations</p>
<p>[Tokyo] On the afternoon of the 16th, when asked by foreign reporters whether Hidemasa's withdrawal from Nanjing meant the severance of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson replied that it did not mean the severance of diplomatic relations. The Japanese government has not asked the Chinese ambassador to Japan to return home, nor has it heard of any move by the Chinese ambassador to return home voluntarily. When asked whether US Secretary of State Hull had proposed not to use Shanghai as a battlefield, the spokesperson replied that the US ambassador to Japan had not made such a proposal to the Foreign Ministry. When asked about the proposal to neutralize Shanghai, the spokesperson replied that the British acting ambassador to Japan, Shade, had mentioned it when he visited Hirota, but had not made any concrete proposals. At that time, the situation in Shanghai was not as critical as it is now. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The British Manchester Guardian Criticizes the Bombing of Shanghai</h3>
<p>Says Foreign Governments Should Protest to Japan</p>
<p>[London] Today's editorial in the Manchester Guardian criticized the bombing of Shanghai. Comparing London to Shanghai, it said that if a British pilot were to shoot at an enemy warship anchored on the Thames River from a high altitude in strong winds, it would be very easy to accidentally hit the buildings next to the river. This is especially true if the driver's skills are poor or the nerves are too excited. Foreign governments should protest to Japan, because Japan is the aggressor, forcing the Chinese to use any methods available to defend their country. If one is arguing for justice, it would be appropriate to order the Japanese to move their warships downstream, but the destruction found in Shanghai could not be avoided by requesting either side. The cases of Guernica in Spain, Tianjin and Shanghai in China, are all the same, demonstrating that destruction will never end until bombing is abolished. (Reuters, 16th Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Japanese National Shot, Evidence Found</h3>
<p>Japanese Ammunition Discovered</p>
<p>[Qingdao] Regarding the shooting of two Japanese nationals here, citizens passing by at the time all witnessed the shooter being a Japanese sailor. The injured were two Japanese men in plain clothes. However, the Japanese side immediately rushed the two men to the hospital, claiming two Japanese sailors, Hattori and Koremoto, were harmed by Chinese plainclothes officers. This was clearly a premeditated plan. On the evening of the 14th, both sides negotiated and investigated the truth. By the morning of the 15th, everything was peaceful. Five Japanese warships remain stationed in the rear harbor, ready to land at any time. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>[Qingdao] Both sides are still investigating the truth of the Japanese shooting incident. Diplomatic channels have not been abandoned. On the evening of the 14th, the municipal government sent councilor Zhou Jiayan and section chief Xie Zuyuan to negotiate with the Japanese side and conduct an investigation. However, there were no witnesses or material evidence, so no results could be reported. The Japanese side drafted an investigation report, stating that the perpetrator was a Chinese person in plain clothes, riding a bicycle and wearing yellow clothing. Our side refused to sign because they had no concrete evidence. The two sides agreed to continue talks on the morning of the 15th. That night, both sides were on high alert, but no incidents occurred. Furthermore, after the incident, our police found one bullet and one spent cartridge at the scene, confirmed to be Japanese ammunition. This was the first discovery of relevant material evidence. Mayor Shen visited the Japanese consulate at 9:45 AM on the 15th, meeting with Consul-General Otori. Commander Shimomura was also present. Shen handed over the bullet found by our police to Otori and Shimomura for examination. The two sides talked for half an hour, agreeing to continue the investigation and strive for a peaceful resolution through diplomatic channels. However, based on the current situation, it appears the Japanese side is still using delaying tactics, so the future developments are difficult to predict. While engaging in diplomatic negotiations, our side will naturally make the necessary preparations. It is reported that five Japanese warships are still docked, and an aircraft carrier is reportedly heading towards Qidao. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Over Five Hundred Students from Beiping Head South to Ji'nan</h3>
<p>Describing the Tragic Situation in Pingjin, Residing in Various Schools in Jinan</p>
<p>[Jinan] Over five hundred male and female university students from Beiping, after traveling by British ship from Tianjin to Yantai and Longkou, took cars to Weixian, and boarded the Jiaoji train, arriving in Jinan on the morning of the 15th. They were greeted by the Provincial Education Department and the Youth Association. At noon, the students sent three representatives to the Provincial Government to meet Chairman Han, reporting on their escape and requesting relief. The Education Department then selected accommodation, with the male students residing at Yuying High School and the female students at No. 1 High School. The situation was extremely dire. According to the student representatives, about two thousand students had fled from Beiping. Some have already gone to Nanjing and Shanghai. Since the 29th Army withdrew, a puppet organization was established in Beiping, maintaining order under the watchful eyes of the Japanese. Zhang Zizhong was long ago abandoned by the Japanese and resigned to go to Tianjin. It is rumored that he has been detained in the French Concession's Xinhua Building. There is also the so-called Yellow Society, an extremely pro-Japanese group that constantly distributes pamphlets with absurd language, even plotting to organize a puppet state in North China. The current Chief of Police of Beiping, Pan Yugui, is willingly a top-tier traitor, repeatedly stating that he will not protect the following four types of people: 1) the Blue Shirts Society, 2) Communists, 3) the cultural sector, 4) personnel affiliated with central government agencies. In addition to the arrest of Central News Agency branch personnel, they will also implement inspections of various schools and cultural institutions. Because of this, the university students had to risk escape. First, they took the Beining Railway to Tianjin. The director of the railway bureau is still Chen Juesheng. The situation along the road was extremely tragic. Armed Japanese soldiers on the train constantly conducted inspections with great arrogance. On both sides of the railway, crops about to ripen were forcibly cut down by the Japanese army to prevent the possibility of Chinese troops being hidden. Langfang and Huangshibo, among other places, have been reduced to rubble. After arriving in Tianjin, there were a large number of refugees in the French Concession. Fortunately, the British Concession had a reception center jointly established by the World Red Cross and the Kailuan Mining Company, providing refugees with food, lodging, and some travel expenses. Entering the Chinese-administered area involved a thorough inspection by the Japanese army. The first batch of students arriving in Jinan numbered 317, including over 30 female students. The second batch consisted of over 200 students, mostly from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Min University, Chaoyang University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Zhongda University, and students from other provinces who went to Beiping to take exams. Their ancestral homes were in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, and the northeastern provinces. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Two Major Problems in Maintaining Order in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Unemployment and Food Supply</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became a war zone, people throughout the city have been carrying luggage, leading the old, and helping the young, all moving towards the area south of the Suzhou Creek, north of Min'guo Road and Xujiahui, and east of Zhongshan Road, which they consider relatively safe, as a place to entrust their lives and property. The lives and property of foreign nationals are also intertwined with those of our Chinese people. As a result of this sudden population density, not only is there a sudden shortage of accommodation, but also the supply and demand of all necessities of life has become unbalanced. Prices are high, and supply cannot meet demand. In addition, unscrupulous merchants are taking the opportunity to hoard and speculate, raising prices and extorting money. This has led to incidents of shops being robbed. Although this is the fault of the unscrupulous merchants themselves, it has a major impact on local order. Now that the war has begun, the Ministry of Finance, in order to stabilize the financial situation, has ordered the banks and money shops in the city to close for two days. Yesterday (the 15th), seven articles of the measures to stabilize finance during the emergency period were announced, restricting deposits and withdrawals, and operations could resume. However, due to the intensity of the war, banks and money shops need to find safer areas to operate, so closures have resumed. Due to the disruption of financing, Shanghai's industry and commerce cannot operate, and more and more businesses are closing. As a result, the number of unemployed people is increasing. Moreover, for every person who loses their job, an entire family loses their livelihood. This is a hidden concern for local order. The cost of living in Shanghai is high, wages are low, and the burden on individuals is great. How many people can save enough to prepare for emergencies, aside from daily expenses? Today, it is impossible to ensure that everyone has a job, but reducing the number of unemployed should be done. The longer the banks and money shops are closed, the greater the losses to the area and the more uneasy people become. Therefore: 1) Financial institutions should resume operations as soon as possible. Even if there are concerns about areas near danger, they should find safer (?) areas to operate as soon as possible. 2) Banks and money shops should quickly decide on any supplements to the measures to stabilize finance that they believe are necessary. 3) Industry and commerce should establish close ties with financial institutions as soon as possible to obtain financial assistance so that they can resume operations. Even if business is slow, they must do everything possible to maintain the minimum livelihood of their employees to reduce the severity of the unemployment problem. 4) Those who cannot stay in Shanghai should be assisted in contacting transportation agencies, and the entire municipal government should use its resources to organize the safest possible methods to send them back to their hometowns by land and sea. No one should be allowed to wander around Shanghai. In short, reducing the number of unemployed people in Shanghai by even one person will increase the area's safety by one point. This is the first point.</p>
<p>"Hunger breeds discontent." Except for a very few, no one wants to resort to desperate measures. However, since the outbreak of the Shanghai incident, grain prices have soared, and people are panicking as if they cannot survive. Why is this? Not long ago, newspapers unanimously believed that even if there was a war in Shanghai, there would be no shortage of food. We doubted this. Whenever there is stormy weather in Shanghai, the supply of grain is slightly reduced, and rice prices still rise. How much more so when a war breaks out? Everyone believes that the war will be prolonged. Wealthy families are hoarding in advance, while the poor can barely afford to eat. In this uneven situation, it is easy to cause unrest. What's more, grain merchants are taking the opportunity to manipulate prices, hoarding and speculating, disregarding the difficulty people have obtaining food and thinking that closing their doors can ensure safety. What good will this do when starving people swarm in? The current situation is not due to a shortage of food, but to uneven distribution and poor management. Earlier, this newspaper reported that there were over 450,000 bags of rice in storage in Shanghai. Those responsible were smug, considering this clear evidence of an ample food supply. However, this reporter was concerned because the stored rice was distributed in warehouses in Pudong and western-style warehouses. If transportation on the Huangpu River is disrupted, how will the rice be supplied? Then having rice would be like having no rice. As for how high rice prices in Anhui and Jiangxi are, that is a distant water that cannot put out a nearby fire and has nothing to do with the current food situation in Shanghai. The most important thing for the people of Shanghai today is how to solve the current and future food problems. This should be done by seeking practical solutions, not by empty talk.</p>
<p>Simply put: 1) The food problem in Shanghai today is a holistic problem. Therefore, it should be the joint responsibility of the municipal government and the authorities of the two concessions, and they should work together within an organized structure to deal with it. 2) First, make the best use of Shanghai's stored grain. Invite those in the industry to conduct a detailed survey and statistical analysis, and find ways to remove it from the various storage facilities and store it in safer places that are easy to distribute. 3) Strictly crack down on grain merchants raising prices. Place the assessment of grain prices under joint management. 4) Divide the city into several locations to provide subsidized grain to maintain the food supply for ordinary people. There should be many locations. 5) Find ways to protect rice merchants or ships transporting rice to Shanghai, or even have the government prepare funds to directly purchase and transport rice from various producing areas to Shanghai. 6) Persuade households and shops not to hoard too much food. Everyone should have a spirit of mutual assistance in times of crisis. The public must be able to eat before one's own food can be guaranteed. 7) Strictly prohibit rice shops from closing their doors and refusing to sell. However, it would be appropriate for the government to limit the quantity of rice that each person can purchase, and the price per unit should still be fair. 8) It was previously rumored that certain bureaus had purchased rice. If they originally intended to use it for regulation, they should sell it immediately. 9) Today's food problem lies in the disruption of transportation and uneven distribution. The Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau should take full responsibility during this national crisis and urgently solve the difficulties of Shanghai's food supply by focusing on the transportation and sales of grain. 10) Investigate the factories in Shanghai that manufacture food, their equipment, production capacity, and the number of workers they employ in order to manufacture food in case of emergency.</p>
<p>The above is a summary of the main points. In order to maintain order in Shanghai and plan for a prolonged war, there is nothing more important than this. Shanghai is a place where people from all countries gather, and it is also a commercial port with the largest population. Its situation is different from other places.</p>
<h3>Our Embassy in Germany Clarifies the Reason for Shells Landing in Shanghai Concessions and Bombings</h3>
<p>Stating that Japan is Using the Concessions for Combat, Leading to the Destruction of China's Preventative Plans</p>
<p>[Berlin] It is reported that the Chinese Embassy issued the following statement regarding the bombing of the Shanghai International Settlement: "Regardless of the 1932 ceasefire agreement, Japan transported a large number of troops, and China was forced to take various defensive measures in Shanghai. Japanese naval landing forces invaded Zhabei from the northern part of the International Settlement and opened fire on the garrison troops. Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun protested to the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, but the response was to continue the attack. Chinese troops were forced to defend themselves. When China took these measures, it tried its best to protect the safety of foreigners in Shanghai. Unfortunately, accidents occurred, and several foreigners perished, which is regrettable. The reason for the bombing of the International Settlement was that a Chinese pilot was seriously injured during aerial combat, and the bomb rack was damaged, so the bombs could not be controlled and fell automatically. Among the many Chinese people killed and injured, there were a few foreigners. The Chinese government expresses its deepest regrets and hopes that these extremely unfortunate events, which were beyond human control, will not occur again in the future.</p>
<p>The Chinese Air Force was compelled to take action in self-defense due to the large concentration of Japanese aircraft and warships. The Chinese government is extremely willing to avoid the impact of the war on the International Settlement, but the Japanese army is using the settlement as a base to launch large-scale attacks on territory under Chinese sovereignty. Therefore, the Japanese side has destroyed China's plan to not affect the settlement. However, China is still making every effort to take all preventative steps. Settlements that are not used as bases by the Japanese army will not be affected. We have learned that there are currently one hundred Japanese aircraft concentrated near Shanghai, preparing to bomb cities and towns along the Jinghu Line, such as Shanghai and Weiting, which have already been bombed. Japan obviously wants to force China to accept unreasonable demands by destroying China's economic center, but China has decided to resist to the end," it was said. (National Army, 15th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting expressed regret today regarding the fact that the Shanghai battle and bombing affected civilians, stating that these civilians were victims in the war of defending democratic sovereignty against the insatiable Japanese militarism. Wang also stated that the Chinese government has repeatedly exercised restraint since the July 7th Incident, but Japan has used aircraft to bomb various parts of China countless times. Not only have war zones suffered, but also civilians and educational and cultural institutions have been destroyed. The recent Shanghai incident was an attempt by Japan to recreate the January 28th Incident in order to destroy China's economic and financial center. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Danger in Shanghai Concessions Created by Japan</h3>
<p>No Sympathy Expressed by Various British Parties Towards Japan</p>
<p>London</p>
<p>The annual meeting of the League of Nations is scheduled to be held in Geneva on September 13th. Regarding the Chinese government's application to the meeting concerning the Sino-Japanese conflict, no news has been received to date. As for the discussion here, apart from the issue of protecting foreigners and foreign interests in China, the impact of the Sino-Japanese conflict on international politics is also a matter of concern. Officials are avoiding taking any position and are only expressing doubt about the possibility of a peaceful resolution of this conflict. In addition, political figures, while expressing regret that Chinese aircraft accidentally dropped bombs in the concessions, believe that, given the Japanese method of warfare, such incidents are likely to occur repeatedly. In general, political figures judge Japan's attitude with absolutely no expression of sympathy. This can be seen from the article published in today's Times, which reflects the views of those in the peace camp. As for those on the left, this goes without saying. The newspaper commented that the Japanese flagship Izumo is anchored a short distance from the concessions, so the danger of the concessions being bombed was created by the Japanese authorities. As for the Japanese side's claim that the Izumo should be anchored near the Japanese consulate, the reasons are insufficient, it was said. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Issues Announcement Urging Merchants to Open for Business</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued an announcement yesterday urging merchants throughout the city to open for business. The original text is as follows: "This chamber has learned that many shops in the city have temporarily closed due to the recent tense situation and financial stagnation. However, this city has a dense population, and people from neighboring counties are flocking to Shanghai to take refuge. The daily necessities of life depend entirely on the supply from shops. Once the market closes, residents feel even more panicked. Now that the seven articles of the financial measures set by the ministry have been announced on the 16th, and since measures are being taken to ensure local order, this chamber has already separately requested the responsible authorities in each area to actively implement them. It is hoped that all banks, money shops, and shops throughout the city will open for business as soon as possible within their means. This is most earnestly requested."</p>

<h3>Director Li Junxun Sincerely Informs Citizens and Students That the War of Resistance Has Begun</h3>
<p>Proving the Victory of the Chinese Nation with the Spirit of Iron and Blood</p>
<p>Mr. Li Xiangqi, the chairman of the city's National Military Training Association, the director of the Civic Training Office, and the commander of the Civic Volunteer Corps, has actively organized and prepared the troops under his command to join the war at any time due to the aggression of the Japanese bandits and the start of the war. Yesterday, he specially published "Sincerely Informing the Citizens and Students Under Training in This City," encouraging everyone to unite and serve the country with a belief in certain victory. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>In the name of the glory of the Chinese nation, I now sincerely inform all of you, the citizens and students under training in this city. Today is truly the first day to formally settle many muddled old scores between China and Japan over the past three hundred years with iron and blood. There is no need for excessive discussion if we win, and there is no need to be dejected if we lose. I hope that all of you will understand the current situation of the Chinese nation. Although it is said that our survival is at stake, there is no danger to blood. The wars of the past two days have completely proven that the spirit of iron and blood of the Chinese nation is more than enough to sweep away the enemy's planes and cannons. To decide the victory of the Chinese nation over the Japanese devils, in the long-term battles to come, the victory and revival of the Chinese nation will ultimately prove to be an established fact. I sincerely hope that all of you, the citizens and students under training in this city, will not stand idly by during this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to serve the country, so that our armed comrades may excel in front. I very much hope that all of you will often remember the ambitions of the day you were trained and the emotions you have felt since training, rise up and do your best to contribute to our Chinese nation. Whether at the front or in the rear, if there is a spirit of fearlessness, the Chinese nation will receive its benefit. I finally urge you that in this great and glorious sacred long-term war, I am willing to encourage and support you to carry arms generously with the belief in certain death and certain victory to become members who directly or indirectly participate in the battle.</p>
<h3>Italian Consul Visited Japanese Flagship to Discuss Withdrawal from Shanghai</h3>
<p>Italian Consul Considers Safety of Foreign Nationals, Japanese Side Gave No Definite Answer</p>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reports that since the Japanese army opened the war in Shanghai, the Izumo warship has been anchored in the Huangpu River, using the concession as a base of operations. Our air force, in order to eliminate the crisis, suddenly bombed, causing damage to the Great World on Avenue Edward VII and the Bund on Nanjing Road. The consular corps has repeatedly advised the Japanese warship to withdraw from the Huangpu River, but the Japanese side refused, inevitably increasing the danger to the lives and property of foreign nationals in the territory. The Italian Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Nilon, took a small boat to the Izumo warship at 1:00 p.m. yesterday to meet with the Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigeru Kawagoe, and Consul Okamoto. After about an hour of talks, he was sent back by a small steamship dispatched by the Izumo warship. A Ta Kung Pao reporter specially visited the Italian consulate staff, who said that Mr. Nilon's trip was also to discuss the withdrawal of the Izumo warship with the Japanese side in order to maintain the security of the concession, but the Japanese side gave no definite answer, resulting in no result.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Eastern District Police Station Not Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Reporter from Shanghai United Press Personally Visited and Witnessed the Tragic Situation of Compatriots Being Persecuted</p>
<p>The main force of the war is now focused on the Eastern District, especially the Yulin Road area, which is a dense area of artillery fire and machine gun fire. It was rumored yesterday that the Shanghai Municipal Council police officers stationed there had withdrawn. A reporter from the Shanghai United Press, accompanied by police officers, ventured to the area to inspect it yesterday morning. Passing through Broadway Road, Japanese soldiers stood guard every three steps, all lying behind obstacles, glaring fiercely. Fortunately, a Japanese police head stood beside the left side of the car, greeting the garrison with passwords along the way, and was able to proceed smoothly. However, the Huishan, Yulin, and Tilanqiao police stations in the Eastern District are still open as usual, but there is no official business to conduct. They cannot go out to perform their duties in the districts under their jurisdiction. Moreover, due to stray bullets flying around, they can only stay indoors. However, the Yangshupu police station is located at the forefront of the fire line. All Chinese and foreign police officers are still stationed there, but they have even less official business to conduct than the three police stations in Huishan. According to the person in charge of the police station, all police agencies of the Shanghai Municipal Council north of the Suzhou River have withdrawn from only the Hongkou and Dixwell Road police stations, while the rest are still stationed as usual. All around the Yulin Road police station are Japanese shops. High-angle guns and machine guns are mounted on every roof. There are still many refugees who have not escaped along the way, but they are afraid that the Japanese will disregard humanity and massacre innocent people at any time, so they hide indoors and dare not go out. The reporter met Mr. Huang Renhe, who said that our army did indeed enter the two spinning mills, Gongda and Donghua, at dawn yesterday morning. The Donghua Mill is located at 1683 Huade Road, near the Liping Road intersection. Gongda and Donghua are both densely populated by Japanese troops. There are indeed no traces of the enemy east of Liping Road and Yangshupu Road. The Jun Gong Road is even occupied by our army. On the way back, the reporter saw more than a dozen Japanese transport vehicles, fully loaded with enemy soldiers and ammunition, hurriedly exiting Broadway Road and turning into Yangshupu Road, speeding eastward, seemingly to reinforce. At the same time, there were seven truck convoys coming from the east and turning into Zhaofeng Road, heading north, seemingly newly landed from enemy ships. The military flags were all rolled up beside the vehicles, so the number could not be seen clearly. When passing the Outer Hongqiao Bridge, the corpses of four innocent refugees who had been brutally killed by the enemy were found at the bridgehead, already rotting and smelling nauseating. The reporter asked the police officers who accompanied him from the police station, who said that they had been lying there for three days and could not be collected. As the reporter was about to look out the car window, he was spotted by an enemy guard at the bridgehead. The reporter was wearing plain clothes, but the guard raised his gun as if to shoot. He quickly ducked back inside and sped south.</p>
<h3>Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Four Banks to Resume Business First Today</h3>
<p>Banking Industry to Formulate Four Supplementary Measures, Three Banks to Manage Reserve and Clearing House, Other Banks and Money Shops to Temporarily Suspend Business</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance announced the "Measures for Stabilizing Finance in Extraordinary Times," the Shanghai Banking Industry Association believes that Shanghai is the financial hub of the country, and industries and businesses everywhere rely on Shanghai for regulation. In order to facilitate the circulation of goods, it has formulated four supplementary measures, which have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. However, in order to maintain the financial order and maintain normal business, the Ministry ordered the two associations to entrust the Central, China, and Communications Banks to effectively manage the joint reserve and clearing house established by them, in order to prevent abuses and stabilize finance. The Ministry ordered the two associations to comply and also sent a letter to the three banks to do so. The original submission from the Banking Industry Association and the approval from the Ministry of Finance are recorded below.</p>
<p>Association Submission</p>
<p>We have investigated and found that the Ministry has already clearly defined measures to stabilize national finance and has issued orders to various places to comply. However, Shanghai is the financial hub of the country, and industries and businesses everywhere rely on Shanghai for regulation. Recently, due to the extension of the war, public panic has been even greater. Now, in order to facilitate the circulation of goods, the association and others have formulated four supplementary measures to further stabilize the market. In the future, if the association and others have appropriate measures to maintain the market, they will report them to the Ministry for verification at any time. Is it appropriate? We respectfully await your instructions and compliance. Attached are four supplementary measures.</p>
<p>Four Measures</p>
<p>㊀ All bank and money shop bills of exchange shall be affixed with a "Same Industry Exchange" stamp. These bills of exchange shall only be allowed to be exchanged among the same industry in Shanghai and shall not be paid in legal tender to purchase foreign exchange. ㊁ Bills of exchange and checks issued by bank and money shop depositors before August 12 of this year shall also be regarded as same industry exchange bills. ㊂ All current deposits of banks and money shops, in addition to paying legal tender in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, all balances in commercial transactions with commercial departments, due to commercial needs, may be paid by same industry exchange. ㊃ For all renewal or new term depositors, banks and money shops shall indicate legal tender or exchange, and payment shall still be made separately in legal tender or exchange.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Approval</p>
<p>We have received your submission. The four supplementary measures you proposed are hereby approved for temporary implementation during this extraordinary period. However, in order to maintain the financial order and maintain legitimate business, the joint reserve and clearing house established by the two associations shall be entrusted to the Central, China, and Communications Banks for effective management, in order to prevent abuses and stabilize finance. In addition to sending a letter to the three banks, you should immediately comply with this approval.</p>
<p>Set Up Offices</p>
<p>The Central, China, and Communications Banks and the Central Trust Bureau have jointly found No. 439 Avenue Albert, French Concession, as a temporary office to regulate the city's finance. It has been decided to move in and open for business at 9:00 a.m. today. The business methods will be handled in accordance with the seven measures for stabilizing finance promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. As for other banks, money shops, and postal savings remittance bureaus, etc., due to the extreme intensity of the Shanghai war, it is practically impossible to open for business. They have been approved by the Ministry of Finance to temporarily suspend business. They will resume business on a scheduled basis as soon as the war situation is slightly calmer. The Banking Association held a temporary members' meeting at the Zhonghui Bank at 11:00 a.m. yesterday and invited non-member banks to participate in the discussion. The exchange matters of various peer bills and the internal problems of various banks during the suspension of business were discussed. Since yesterday, various foreign banks in the city have also temporarily suspended business due to the war.</p>
<p>Unified Exchange Rate</p>
<p>Since the temporary suspension of business by the banking industry after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, money exchange shops have taken the opportunity to lower market prices, which has greatly affected the general public. Because various banks and money shops were still not open yesterday, the market situation was once again chaotic, and market prices were further reduced. Moreover, banknotes of five yuan and ten yuan, etc., were refused to be exchanged. The city's Money Exchange Industry Association, in order to stabilize the market and unify the exchange rate, has specifically convened all members at 2:00 p.m. today to discuss and decide on a unified exchange rate method, which will then be announced to all industries for uniform implementation.</p>
<h3>Reports of French Anti-Aircraft Guns Bombarding Our Aircraft Are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Paris, 16th (Havas) - According to news from the Japanese side in Shanghai, the Shanghai concession authorities have set up anti-aircraft guns in the French concession and fired several shots at Chinese aircraft flying over the concession this morning, causing the Chinese aircraft to change their flight path. After this news spread here, all newspapers were extremely concerned. Later, a Havas telegram was received denying the above rumors, believing that they were completely unfounded, and everyone was relieved.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Concession Authorities Urge Citizens to Remain Calm</h3>
<p>In Case of Air Raids, Must Immediately Take Shelter Indoors</p>
<p>Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, issued a posted announcement yesterday, saying: "This is to announce that the current situation is unstable and people's hearts are shaken. However, our government loves peace and has been declared to the world by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, which is known to friendly countries. As the Commander, I am duty-bound to defend the territory and protect the people. All members of the public should do their best to remain calm and obey the government. They should especially protect friendly foreign nationals at all times and in all places as much as possible. If there are any lawless elements who attempt to disturb public order, they will be severely arrested and prosecuted without any leniency. All must abide by this and implement it earnestly. This is the announcement."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Bureau announced: "All residents and refugees in the Public Concession, in the event of an air raid (airplane war), must immediately take shelter indoors and hide by a protective wall. Do not stand outside the wall, by the door, or by the window, etc. Although there may not be bombs, the greatest danger is shrapnel and unexploded bullets, etc., which may fall from the air. No one, under any circumstances, should stand in the open or watch from the roof."</p>
<p>The French Patrol Police and various groups have been posting notices along the streets for days, urging citizens to pay attention. The general idea is: "Please take shelter in nearby houses when airplanes pass by, and then close the doors and windows of the houses immediately. As the current situation prolongs, the public should only walk outside when necessary."</p>
<h3>On-the-Spot Inspection Record by Our Reporter at the Forefront</h3>
<p>Soldiers Have Not Rested for Four Days and Nights, A Certain Military Officer Talks About Fragments of Victory</p>
<p>When the air battle between the two sides was fierce yesterday morning, our reporter specially went to the Jiangwan Zhabei front line to inspect it. As the car passed the iron fence of the Public Concession and arrived at our army's defense line, he felt a kind of solemn, inviolable atmosphere, and the excitement of his spirit rose to the boiling point. The brave soldiers of our army, fully armed, with five or six hand grenades hanging on their chests, were not very tall, but each was lively and brave. Their ages were all around twenty years old. In their amiable conversation, they showed a stern and unyielding expression. The car twisted and turned forward towards the fortifications, and the defenses were gradually strengthened. There were still some refugees scattered along the way, but most of them still lived calmly in the war zone. Women were carrying their children and walking naturally on the street. The people were gathered in clusters, chatting. This quiet phenomenon, on the one hand, can imply the victory of the war at the front, and on the other hand, it can be seen that the army and the people are united as one, and the people in the rear are calm and calm. Walking again and again, taking step by step closer to the front line, the sound of guns and cannons gradually became denser. The sound of small cannons and mortars shook the eardrums even more. When approaching the front line by one hundred meters, bullets whizzed over the top of the head. He quickly squatted down and walked along the wall. At first, he felt a little scared, but later he became calm. The most moving sight in the trenches of the first line of defense was the brave soldiers of our army, who had not closed their eyes for four days and nights. Their eyes emitted a red light, fixed on the enemy's line of defense across the way, waiting madly to kill the enemy. Their whole bodies were covered in mud, and their faces and hands could not be distinguished. The reporter silently paid them his infinite respect with tears in his eyes, not knowing whether they were sweet or sour. He hurriedly bid farewell, ran to a slightly distant place, and found several senior officers. He spoke freely about the process of killing the enemy. Everyone's faces were full of excitement, and they were truly unspeakably happy. At this moment, several wounded brave soldiers of our army were carried in. The reporter hurriedly ran over, shook their hot hands, and expressed his deep condolences. They nodded in thanks in a slight groan. The reporter also said goodbye and got into the car. As the wheels whizzed and spun, the scenes he had seen on the front line flooded into his mind one by one. He felt that the people in the rear had not fulfilled their responsibilities to protect the country. He only felt one hundred and twenty minutes of apology and shame for the brave soldiers at the front who were fighting desperately and sacrificing their lives to defend the country.</p>
<p>The reporter talked with a young military officer at the front for ten minutes. He was the one who led the team to besiege the enemy near the Patriotic Girls' School at 4:00 a.m. yesterday. He roughly said something about the battle situation... "We received orders to depart from the Zhizhi University. The sky was not yet bright, and we walked forward quickly. At first, we did not see any traces of the enemy. When we arrived at the northwest side of the Patriotic Girls' School, the enemy's machine guns fired densely. We crawled forward one by one. After a while, we shouted in unison and bravely chased after them. They retreated. About half a mile away, the enemy retreated and entrenched themselves in high-rise buildings, where dozens of enemy troops were ambushed. Machine guns swept again, and the smoke and flames were dense, which was just right to cover us. At this time, our team also used dense artillery fire to deal with them, sweeping the enemy downstairs. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy on the upper floors jumped out of the back windows one after another, some injured and some fleeing. Our army did not pursue further and hurriedly entered the search, seizing a lot of ammunition. At this time, the rising sun everyone calmed down. The building had windows on all sides, and there were no tall buildings nearby. It could be seen hundreds of meters away. As a temporary bunker, it was in the best position. After we had finished the arrangement, we sent a team to search the Patriotic Girls' School. We did not see the enemy inside, and our reinforcements had arrived one after another. The plan to encircle the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters was finally completed..."</p>
<p>The military officer was very eloquent. Then he said, "At this final moment, we only know how to fight for survival, fight for justice, and fight to defend our territory. Life can be sacrificed. What else are we nostalgic for? Therefore, on the day before 'August 13,' when our army received orders to go to Shanghai to fight, which one of us was not spirited and took the lead bravely? We know that our government has an overall plan, and our soldiers have the final determination. We hope that our compatriots will fight to the end with one heart and one mind. Victory will definitely be ours." When he spoke, his attitude was激昂 and his will was strong. He was worthy of being a rising star in the National Army.</p>
<p>I also have to report to the readers that he is from Liaoning Province and is a patriot who has no home to return to. He studied at Tongji University earlier and later transferred to the third grade of Fu Jen Catholic University in Beiping. He was promoted to the Central Military Academy and graduated this year. He enlisted in the army for three months.</p>
<h3>British, American, Italian, and Dutch Nationals Prepare to Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>American Women and Children to Manila This Morning, French Concession Not Considering Evacuation</p>
<p>After the Western nationals in the Public Concession north of the Suzhou River were notified by the consulates of various countries to retreat to the south of the Suzhou River, British women and children nationals were the first to be scheduled to leave Shanghai on British ships on the 17th. Other nationals were also notified by the British Consulate to gather at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and leave on a scheduled basis. The US Consulate is also preparing to evacuate American nationals and has scheduled the first batch of women and children to be sent to Manila on the President Jefferson. The French Consulate has not considered the evacuation of French nationals, believing that the safety of nationals in the French Concession is absolutely not a concern. As for Italian nationals, they will also leave Shanghai if necessary. The Dutch Consulate in Shanghai has also notified Dutch nationals in the city to register with the consulate as soon as possible so that they can be protected and leave Shanghai if necessary. At the same time, it has chartered a ship, the Tsinan, from the Java Mailboat Company to be stationed outside the Wusong Estuary in preparation for nationals to board and take shelter. As for Japanese nationals who have stayed in Shanghai and those who have come to Shanghai from Hankou and other places, most of them have not had time to return to Japan, numbering at least 6,000 or more. These temporary nationals are currently protected by the Chinese and Japanese armies and concentrated in the Yangshupu area, waiting for an opportunity to take ships back to Japan. The remaining Japanese nationals are concentrated in the Yokohama Specie Bank on the Bund.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Sends Telegram to Thank the Support Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association previously sent a telegram to General Zhang Zhizhong, commander of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison, to express their condolences. Commander Zhang has now received a reply telegram saying, "(Omissions)... I am deeply grateful for your kind telegram. It is the duty of soldiers to resist aggression for the country. I am ashamed and dare not accept your praise. I am especially grateful for your purchase of condolences. I hereby send a telegram on behalf of all the soldiers of the army to express my gratitude. Zhang Zhizhong salutes."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Spokesperson Talks About the Significance of Issuing National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Encourage Citizens to Donate to Save the Country, Total Amount of Bonds is 500 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The newspaper reported the other day that the government had a plan to issue circulating vouchers. When a reporter from the Central News Agency visited the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance, he said, "The foundation of our country's legal tender is extremely stable. The so-called issue of circulating vouchers that has been rumored outside may be a private proposal. The government has no intention of doing so, nor is it necessary. However, since the full-scale war of resistance was launched, citizens have been donating money and goods with patriotic enthusiasm to help the country. As citizens fulfill their responsibility to save the country, they do not expect any reward. The expenses for saving the country should be borne by the entire nation. The government should encourage the enthusiasm of these patriotic people who are destroying their families to relieve the national crisis. Therefore, regulations have been formulated to issue national salvation bonds. All people or organizations who donate cash or valuable items for the purpose of saving the country will be given national salvation bond tickets in accordance with the amount donated. The principal will be repaid in installments after the end of the war. The purpose of these bonds is not only to compensate the donors, but also to commend the honor of those who contribute money to save the country." The draft of the National Salvation Bond Regulations is attached below.</p>
<p>Draft National Salvation Bond Regulations</p>
<p>Article 1. The National Government shall issue bonds to encourage national salvation donations, named National Salvation Bonds. Article 2. All individuals or organizations who donate cash or valuable items for the purpose of saving the country shall be given these bonds in accordance with the amount donated. Article 3. The total amount of these bonds is 500 million yuan, issued at 100% of the face value. Article 4. These bonds shall be repaid in installments over 20 years from the third year after the end of the war, with a lottery drawn every six months, and funds shall be allocated by the national treasury. Article 5. The bond tickets for these bonds shall be divided into seven types: 10,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan. All are in bearer form. Article 6. These bonds shall be raised by agencies entrusted by the Ministry of Finance and announced. Article 7. Anyone who forges or damages these bonds shall be punished by the judicial authorities in accordance with the law. Article 8. These regulations shall be implemented from the date of approval.</p>
<h3>Wartime Services in Various Circles in the Rear</h3>
<p>Rescue and Comfort Actively Underway</p>
<p>Ambulance Teams</p>
<p>The city's Ambulance Committee is rescuing wounded soldiers day and night, working tirelessly. The wounded are first rescued from the front lines by emergency teams in vehicles and then sent to various ambulance teams or hospitals for treatment. The committee currently has sixteen emergency teams stationed in areas such as Datong, Zhabei, Zhenru, Nanxiang, and Xinzhuang. Wounded soldier hospitals are located in Kunshan, Jiaxing, Jiading, Taicang, and other places, and are in contact with local military and police. All ambulance team members are bravely risking their lives amidst gunfire to rescue the wounded, resulting in the complete annihilation of all stretcher bearers in the Datong emergency team by enemy artillery fire, a heroic sacrifice. However, due to the current shortage of gasoline, the transportation of ambulances is facing extreme difficulties. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that all sectors of society will conserve gasoline and donate to the committee (address: China Red Cross Society, 856 Xinzha Road) so that rescue work will not be halted. Yesterday, a total of over two hundred wounded soldiers from the front lines, mostly with minor injuries, have already been sent to various hospitals for treatment.</p>
<p>Literary Circles</p>
<p>Shanghai's literary circles held an inaugural meeting of the Wartime Service Corps at the Guanle Garden at 10:00 AM yesterday. Over thirty people attended, including Guo Moruo, Zheng Boqi, Ren Baige, Song Zhi's, and Ai Siqi. First, the chairman reported on the significance of initiating the organization of the literary circles' wartime service corps. The meeting then elected Zhou Yang, Ouyang Shan, Jin Ding, and four others as directors, dividing into three groups: general affairs, publicity, and liaison. It was decided on the spot that the corps would expand its organization, widely recruit colleagues from the literary circles to participate, and establish work contacts with all salvation groups. The corps held a board meeting in the afternoon, dividing all members into groups. It is reported that detailed discussions were held on wartime visits, street lectures, publishing tabloids, and the unity and life relief of literary colleagues. Work began that day.</p>
<p>Educational Circles</p>
<p>Educational figures Chen Kemei, Sun Hanbing, Sun Xiaolou, Yan Enzuo, Zhang Dingfu, Zhu Qinglai, and others, recognizing that the Shanghai war has broken out and that assistance and relief work at the front and in the rear are greatly dependent on the efforts of the educational community, have held talks for several days to discuss organizing an educational wartime service corps. Yesterday, the corps held an inaugural meeting, attended by Wu Zelin, Chen Dingkui, Huang Shensu, Zhang Yi, Zuo Shunsheng, Xie Chenping, and over forty others. Huan Zaoshi was publicly elected as chairman. He first reported on the preparations and tasks of the corps, then reported on the results of contact with the Rear Support Association and various anti-enemy support associations, and then passed the corps' constitution and elected Zhang Yi, Sun Hanbing, Sun Xiaolou, Lu Dingkui, Wu Zelin, Yan Enzuo, Zhu Qinglai, Pan Dakui, Zuo Shunsheng, Huang Zhongsu, Xie Chenping, Wang Zaoshi, Chen Kemei, Peng Wenyin, and Lu Shidao as directors. Finally, it was decided to borrow the School of Political Science and Law as a shelter for students in distress, and Lu Shidao and Xu Pengfei were appointed to prepare. A war report was also created for soldiers to read and discuss, and Liu Shijie and others were appointed to formulate a plan. The directors of the association decided to work daily at the Qinghua Alumni Association in the Jincheng Villa at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hede Road.</p>
<p>Lawyers Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association, recognizing the seriousness of the national crisis and the selfless and fearless efforts of the soldiers fighting the enemy at the front, has formed five sub-committees: ㊀ military training, ㊁ relief, ㊂ propaganda, ㊃ discipline, and ㊄ fundraising. All executive and supervisory committee members will each take responsibility for one group to carry out various tasks. Regarding the issue of comforting the loyal and brave soldiers at the front, a committee has been appointed to purchase necessary items and will immediately elect representatives to send them to the front lines for comfort.</p>
<p>General Labor Union</p>
<p>The war has been fierce in recent days, even more so than during the January 28th Incident. The anti-Japanese heroes injured at the front, in addition to some who received initial treatment on the spot, had a portion transported back to the Shanghai Red Cross Society Hospital for treatment a few days ago. The city's General Labor Union and the Labor Salvation Association specially appointed Standing Committee members Zhang Kechang, Shao Xubai, and Long Peiyun at 9:00 AM yesterday, carrying fruits, cigarettes, biscuits, and other comfort items to the wounded soldier hospital at the intersection of Aiduya Road and Sichuan Road to express their condolences and respect. The wounded soldiers expressed their gratitude and expressed their willingness to continue killing the enemy after being discharged from the hospital. Their anti-Japanese spirit was extremely enthusiastic. Furthermore, since the Workers' Wartime Service Corps of the association began registration, the number of participants has increased exponentially. In addition to convening a meeting of all members at the Xiaonanmen Association a few days ago, the first batch of volunteers to go to the front lines to undertake military transportation work gathered at the association's office at 9:00 AM on the 15th. A total of one hundred and five people reported, and Corps Commander Zhou Xuexiang, Deputy Corps Commanders Shao Lubai and Zhang Kechang, and Team Leader Long Peiyun, etc., separately compiled and distributed symbols, with twenty-five people per team, and appointed Huang Qingfang as the general leader. All members stood in the rain from morning to noon, with extremely excited spirits. At lunchtime, they only filled their stomachs with two large pancakes, and their spirit of enduring hardship for the country is especially admirable. Soon, the entire team departed on two trucks in the afternoon to go to the front lines and participate in battlefield service. It is reported that the corps is currently organizing a second batch of members and is also seeking technical workers such as car drivers, repair mechanics, and electrical mechanics. Those who volunteer to participate can register at 545 Jiugong Road.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Relief Committee's food supply group specializes in providing food for various refugee shelters. Recently, it was heard that the soldiers on the front lines needed dry food, fruits, and other items, so they specially prepared fruit trucks, totaling thousands of pounds, to send to the front lines, and continued to prepare bread and other items to send by car.

<p>Mingshe Society</p>
<p>The city's Mingshe Society, organized by people from the industrial and commercial sectors, has been established for nearly a year and has devoted much effort to social events.

<h3>National Salvation Work</h3>
<p>Battlefield Service, Fundraising, and Comfort</p>
<p>National Salvation Association Battlefield Service</p>
<p>Since the sudden change in the situation in Pingjin and the Japanese invaders invaded China, the national spirit has been extremely inspired. The city's national salvation organizations have been established one after another. The Chinese Youth National Salvation Association was born just as the Shanghai War broke out, and is actively engaged in anti-Japanese and national salvation work. The reporter visited a person in charge of the association yesterday and received a very detailed account of the process. The outline is recorded as follows: Our association is the only organization of national salvation youth in Shanghai, composed of people with enthusiasm for patriotic groups. It convened an inaugural meeting yesterday (the 15th) and issued a declaration. Its main purpose is to resist Japan, save the nation, and recover lost territories, and it plans to participate in various battlefield service work in the near future. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide various conveniences in their work, and especially hope that gentlemen in the commentary circles will provide guidance at any time so that the great cause of Chinese national salvation can be completed.</p>
<p>The association's temporary address is at 15 Jin Shenfu Road. Anyone who sympathizes with the association's national salvation work can automatically participate. Therefore, there has been a great rush to register to join the association in recent days. The daily registration time is from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, and the procedure is very simple.</p>
<p>Children's Theater Society Fundraising and Comfort</p>
<p>The Chinese Model Children's Theater Society originally planned to perform a large-scale national salvation children's drama. Due to the outbreak of the Shanghai War, it was unable to perform. All members of the society organized the "Children's National Salvation Association" and agreed on: (A) sending an official letter to the Social Affairs Bureau for record and joining the Anti-Enemy Support Association; (B) dividing the work into five departments: drama, film, publishing, publicity, and comfort; (C) dividing the publicity into four teams: lectures, slogans, drawings, and singing; (D) dividing the comfort into two teams: fundraising and comfort. They set off yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM to raise funds in various places. Half of the proceeds will be used to relieve refugees and half to comfort wounded soldiers. The team gathered at 5:00 PM, and the directors purchased comfort items and went to various shelters and hospitals to offer condolences.</p>
<p>National Salvation Speaking Troupe Seeks Talent</p>
<p>The People's National Salvation Speaking Troupe has been praised by the general public in Shanghai for its work since its establishment. In addition to engaging in national salvation propaganda in public places such as radio stations, schools, and factories in Shanghai a few days ago, the troupe is now in this extraordinary period, so its work should be carried out more actively. For example, increasing broadcasting time on radio stations, as well as sending speakers to refugee shelters in Shanghai, and even distributing them to provinces, cities, townships, and towns across the country to engage in national salvation propaganda in order to awaken the general public and immediately engage in national salvation. In addition, the troupe has also formed a comfort team to raise money and materials to transport to the front to comfort the heroic soldiers. Therefore, the troupe feels that the talent within the troupe is not enough to allocate. Anyone who is enthusiastic about national salvation work and has speaking talent and experience, regardless of gender, is asked to go and participate. The troupe's address is 113 Parker Road in the British Concession.</p>
<p>Art Circles National Salvation Group Established</p>

<h3>Refugee Relief Situation in Various Institutions</h3>
<p>Two Thousand Ningbo People Returned to Their Hometown Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, refugees have gathered in the concessions, and due to the obstruction of land and water transportation, evacuation has become a problem. According to the Ningbo Shanghai Association, the association has specially found a Fushun merchant ship to temporarily rent and will send a batch of fellow refugees back to their hometown. The number is estimated to be more than a thousand. The ship set sail at 8:00 AM yesterday. If there are no obstacles, it can safely arrive in Ningbo last night. According to the report of the comfort personnel sent to the front by the association, our army is currently short of food, and they need fruits because they are thirsty on the front lines. Please ask the people in the rear to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Relief Efforts of the Guangdong Association</p>
<p>The Guangdong Shanghai Association is making every effort to provide relief to fellow provincials. The number of people received in recent days has reached more than 5,000, who are separately accommodated in Xinxin, Letuan, Qingliang Temple, Poor Children's Education Institute, and Yanfeng Guild Hall.</p>
<p>Deliberations of the Relief Committee</p>
<p>The Relief Committee held an emergency meeting at 1:00 AM yesterday. After Chairman Pan reported on the various groups, the refugee relief problem was discussed. ㊀ Do everything possible to transport people away from Shanghai by inland river ships. ㊁ Immediately send people to investigate the current situation of the various shelters and improve all their poor facilities. ㊂ Quickly set up refugee hospitals to prevent diseases from occurring and spreading. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. The committee has provided relief to tens of thousands of refugees in recent days, and the original Yun Nan Road Renji Tang Association address is insufficient. It was specially moved to the Pudong Township Association office yesterday. However, in order to facilitate contact with various circles, the training group is still located on Yunnan Road.</p>
<p>Rescue Efforts of the Red Swastika Society</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society rescue team still mixed the first and second teams into four routes yesterday and set off successively at 7:00 AM in the morning. The first route was led by team leader Hu Zhongcheng, accompanied by Chang Yi, to Hongkou Huasheng Road and Yangshupu to rescue more than 500 ladder people, who were all sent to relatives and friends along the way. The remaining dozens of people were sent to the third shelter for resettlement. The second route was led by President Li Dixian, accompanied by members, to Baoshan Road and Tiantong'an Road, where they rescued old, weak, women, and children at any time. The third route was led by team members with stretchers to the battlefield to rescue injured soldiers and civilians. However, while traveling to Zhongyou Road, just as the two armies were fighting, bullets were flying and the artillery fire was intense. The team lay down in the riverbank, and many shells fell to the left and right, splashing mud and water so that the team members were like entering a muddy road. The team members still risked their lives to rescue the wounded soldiers and sent them to the first and second hospitals. The fourth route was led by team leader Shi Yangxing, leading the staff members from Nanyang Bridge to the Zhaojia Road, turning to Zhonghua Road, and entering the Penglai Road Wenmiao Road to patrol the Nanshi area, rescuing more than 50 refugees along the way. It was also heard that the society's fourth shelter has begun to accommodate more than 100 people. Currently, there are many homeless refugees along the streets. The society has temporarily used the Changle Tea Garden on Sima Road as the fifth shelter and has invited Zhao Pinshan to be the director of the shelter and Wang Genghu to be the deputy director. The sixth shelter is being funded by Zhang Nachuan of the Central Trust Bureau and is also in preparation and will be established in the near future.</p>
<h3>Stray Bullets Injure People Everywhere, Residents Take Shelter</h3>

<p>August 15th</p>
<p>At around 3:00 PM on the previous day (the 15th), when the enemy's air force was fighting fiercely in the northeast sky, stray bullets flew in all directions. Zhangjia Garden, a place far from the war zone on Jing'an Temple Luomai Te Ban Si Tuo Road, was also affected by stray bullets. At that time, as many as seven people standing in the alley were injured by stray bullets. In addition, two people were injured at the back door of a certain family there.

<p>August 16th</p>
<p>Yesterday morning and afternoon, planes fought in the sky, and anti-aircraft artillery and anti-aircraft machine guns were fired in response on land and water. A stray bullet fell in the courtyard of the Second Special Court in the French Concession, fortunately without injuring anyone, only blasting away the bark of a tree. In addition, among those killed by stray bullets in the concession were Liu, a 39-year-old maid at 56 Geluo Xi Road, and a woman of about 20 years old named Dada at 79, Lane 482, Caishi Road. Fei Dazhen, a woman from Songjiang at 533 Ya'er Bei Road, and five unidentified men were injured on the way and died before being treated at the Red Cross Society General Hospital on Haige Road.

<p>Furthermore, at 6:00 AM yesterday morning, enemy planes flew to the Nanshi area to reconnaissance, and then there was a rumor that the South Railway Station was bombed by enemy planes, and the train that departed from the South Railway Station was swept by enemy planes and returned to the South Railway Station. However, according to the police station in charge, it was said that there was no such thing. It only said that although enemy planes once flew over Nanshi, it was reconnaissance in nature. However, at 8:00 AM in the morning, six people were indeed injured by stray bullets in the French Concession (that is, the border between China and France) on Nanyang Bridge. One person was killed by stray bullets on Zhaozhou Road in the Chinese Concession.</p>

<h3>Municipal Council Cracks Down on Radio Stations Indiscriminately Broadcasting News</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council, recognizing that radio stations sometimes broadcast inaccurate news, which is most likely to cause panic and bewilderment, is essential to crack down on. Therefore, it has earnestly advised the owners of all radio stations to immediately stop broadcasting any news that has not been confirmed by reliable authorities. If any radio station does not accept the advice and arbitrarily broadcasts news, the Municipal Council Police Department will order it to be closed.</p>
<h3>Mr. Ding Guitang Donates 50,000 Yuan Alone</h3>
<p>Mr. Ding Guitang, Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, recently learned that the Shanghai War has broken out, and he admires the loyalty and bravery of the anti-Japanese soldiers. At the same time, he deeply pities the displaced refugees. Therefore, he generously donated 50,000 yuan and allocated 20,000 yuan as consolation money, 20,000 yuan as rescue money, and the remaining 10,000 yuan for refugee relief. The payment was delivered to the local association yesterday for distribution. At the beginning of the war, military resources are needed, and it is possible to use the hard-earned savings to provide special military needs. With enthusiasm for serving the country and relieving difficulties can be expected. Mr. Ding is truly admirable.</p>
<h3>The Front Needs Motorized Bicycles</h3>
<p>Urgently Hope That All Circles Will Donate to Facilitate the Killing of the Enemy</p>

<p>A Sincere Announcement to Compatriots Who Are Enthusiastic About Consolation</p>
<p>Artillery fire is continuous, and enemies are killed everywhere. Our front-line soldiers are loyally and bravely killing the enemy, and our rear compatriots are sincerely consoling them. I wonder what kind of items are needed? The reporter of this museum has confirmed to the authorities that the current needs are emergency medicine, Chinese Rendan, Western candles, canned milk, bread biscuits, various canned foods, and gauze bandages. Patriotic compatriots who want to offer condolences should do their best to purchase these items, regardless of the amount, and send them to the collection, which will be of great benefit to the future of the war.</p>

<h3>Continued Commentary from English and French Newspapers on the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>The English Times Urges the World to Pay Attention to Japan's Actions</p>
<p>[London] Following a cabinet meeting, the Japanese government issued a public statement declaring that Japan does not desire to occupy Chinese territory. The Times of London has published an article commenting on the Far Eastern situation and reviewing the unfortunate events that have created the current situation. It believes that the Japanese government welcomes these unfortunate events because they can partition Chinese territory. The Chinese government believes that Japan clearly wants to obtain a corridor in North China, creating a superior Japanese power, to serve as a base for defending against Soviet Russia, and at the same time, to attack southern China. The current serious situation would not be difficult to resolve, but Japan's increasing troops in Hebei is making the situation increasingly serious. The newspaper solemnly declares that this state of hostility is neither beneficial nor harmful to both sides. Britain, France, and the United States have important interests in the Far East that must be protected and are now maintaining close cooperation. (Sixteenth National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] Various newspapers have continued to comment on the war between China and Japan. The Socialist People's Daily reported that the main task of the major powers is no longer to prevent war or stop war, but to limit the scope of the war and prevent it from becoming general. Whether this policy is effective is not discussed for the moment, but it is true that the major powers have greatly retreated as a result. The real question now is whether these countries recognize this retreat as a fait accompli, or whether they want to restore their lost position. Regarding this point, these countries only need to work together and persistently to succeed. Otherwise, the countries will have no way out of their current state of disappointment and danger. (Sixteenth Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] Local newspapers today published lengthy reports on Chinese aircraft dropping bombs in the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. However, the number of deaths and injuries varied from newspaper to newspaper. It is reported that the Shanghai Consular Body plans to propose to the Chinese and Japanese authorities that both sides of the Shanghai war cease using aircraft. The newspapers also discussed the reason why the bombs were dropped. It is reported that the Chinese authorities are very disturbed by this bombing and that the Chinese pilots did not do it intentionally. (Fifteenth National Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The Times recently commented on the war between China and Japan, saying, "If the world focuses on Japan's actions and not on its declared policies, then what Japan uses to accuse China, even if it was not intentionally manufactured by Japan, will certainly be used by Japan to the fullest extent, hoping to re-divide a large part of Chinese territory. This is clearly obvious. The goal of Japan's true rulers is to create a corridor in northern China, controlled and organized by Japan, to become a military base for countering Soviet Russia. Once there is an appropriate opportunity, it will continue to invade the south. Britain, the United States, and France all have important interests in the Far East that must be protected, and they are now closely linked to deal with it." The Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, reported, "If China appeals to the League of Nations regarding Japan's aggression, all member states of the League of Nations should consider the best way to fulfill their obligations. One method worth trying is to issue an application to both China and Japan, especially to issue a warning to Japan, and to have countries with direct relations serve as mediators."

<p>[Paris] General Yang Hucheng, who went abroad for investigation after the Xi'an Incident, is now here and preparing to return home. According to Yang's interview with a "Late News" reporter, he was summoned back home by telegram from Chairman Chiang. China has no other way out but to resist its brutal enemy, Japan, by various means. We must remember that only a free China is a guarantee of peace in the Far East. China's only hope is to survive peacefully, but peace cannot be achieved until Japanese imperialism abandons its aggression. (Fifteenth National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Traitors Have Reached the End of Their Road; Heaven and Earth Cannot Tolerate Them</h3>
<p>Li Naigeng Executed; Bare-Armed Man Beats a Traitor to Death; Hong Renbao Arrested; Four Traitors Arrested</p>
<p>Li Naigeng Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Headquarters recently arrested a female traitor from Yangzhou named Li Naigeng for spying on our military intelligence in the Nanshi area. The police arrested her. It is now reported that this case has been thoroughly investigated, and Chief Cai Jinjun ordered her to be executed by firing squad. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Yao Guangnai, director of the Ximen Branch, and Shen Zhenhua, director of the Laobeimen Police Station, identified the traitor Li Naigeng according to the law, and then escorted her to Chen Yingshi's former execution site in Laoximen to be executed by firing squad. Everyone who saw it applauded.</p>
<p>One Traitor Beaten to Death</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, next to a tea jar on the roadside at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Avenue Edward VII, a bare-chested traitor wearing blue cloth trousers suddenly sprinkled poison powder into the tea. After the crowd discovered it, they beat him and planned to drag him to the police station. When he reached the entrance of the Ningbo Fellow Association, the traitor fell to the ground and died. It is also heard that there were two other beatings on the road.</p>
<p>Hong Renbao Arrested</p>
<p>Hong Renbao, a follower of the big traitor Chang Yuqing in western Shanghai, usually recruits workers for the Japanese. Therefore, he relies on the power of the Japanese to act recklessly. The citizens have been disgusted by him. Since the start of the war, the citizens of western Shanghai have all wanted to catch him and feel satisfied. The traitor hid deep in the Gongda Yarn Factory and dared not go out. After the Japanese army withdrew, the traitor still lingered, seemingly with a mission. Yesterday, at around 1:00 AM, the traitor jumped out of the Gongda breach due to lack of food. He was captured by our security team and handed over to the headquarters for interrogation. The capture of this big traitor has greatly pleased the people.</p>
<p>Four Traitors Arrested</p>
<p>(1) Yesterday at 5:15 PM, four traitors were discovered at the intersection of Minitini Road and Wagner Table Road in the French Concession, secretly putting some kind of medicine powder into the tea jar there. Residents living there saw their secretive actions and immediately reported them to the nearby Boy Scouts. Many Boy Scouts rushed over. Two traitors escaped when they saw that the situation was not good, but the other two were caught because they escaped slowly. After the Boy Scouts checked them, they found that each traitor was carrying a seven-inch pistol. When they took off their straw hats, they saw Japanese symbols written on the leather edges inside the hats. When asked if they were traitors, they did not defend themselves at all. The Boy Scouts took them to the nearby police station to be investigated. (2) Yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 PM, a traitor used by the Japanese scattered poison powder in the tea pavilion in the area of ​​Gordon Road and Xinzha Road in western Shanghai. A bag of poison powder and enemy symbols were found on his body. Knowing that he was a traitor, the crowd became agitated and beat him severely. After the police arrived and inquired about the situation, they detained him and sent him to the police station to await trial in court. (3) Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, Boy Scouts dispatched by the Red Cross captured a traitor near Qingliang Temple. The traitor was disguised as a rickshaw puller, pushing an unlicensed and half-broken rickshaw. He passed by the Red Cross on Xinzha Road and frequently asked the Boy Scouts how many wounded soldiers there were in the hospital and how the work was going. The Boy Scouts suspected that the person was suspicious and detained him in the association. The headquarters sent someone to investigate. The man initially denied it, but then confessed that he had been used by the Japanese because of financial difficulties. He was taken to the headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Tobacco and Paper Shops and Rice Shops Are Destroyed One After Another</h3>
<p>Treacherous Merchants Can Be Condemned; Refugee Plunder is Worrying</p>
<p>Da Feng Chang Destroyed</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 12:50 PM, the owner of Da Feng Chang Tobacco and Paper Shop at 587 Yu Qiaqing Road, Shou Yizhi, was driven by greed. In the face of the current national crisis and the fiercest war of resistance, he deliberately lowered the exchange rate of legal tender. He was willing to exchange five yuan of legal tender for only four yuan, and one yuan of legal tender for only eight jiao of auxiliary currency. This caused dissatisfaction among the people, who questioned him one after another. The shop owner did not know how to repent and instead spoke rudely, which aroused public outrage. Da Feng Chang was immediately destroyed without leaving anything behind. The shop owner saw that the situation was not good and fortunately escaped through the back door, thus avoiding being beaten. After the police arrived, they persuaded the crowd to disperse, and the situation calmed down.</p>
<p>Disturbances at Qian Tai Chang</p>
<p>Yesterday evening at around 6:45 PM, at the Qian Tai Chang double-front tobacco and paper shop at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Meibai Ge Road, refugees had a quarrel because they bought goods for one yuan and made eight jiao. Then they fought fiercely. In an instant, hundreds of refugees used door panels, doors, etc. to hit each other indiscriminately. The iron railings installed on the top were knocked down, and the remaining counters, display windows, and glass were destroyed. Fortunately, the soldiers guarding the Niaozhen Road Bridge arrived, and the refugees dispersed in a rush, suffering heavy losses.</p>
<p>Xie Da Aids the Enemy with Rice</p>
<p>It is said that Xie Da Rice Shop on Bei Di Road aids the enemy with grain. Yesterday afternoon, it aroused the public outrage of patriotic people. Some citizens destroyed the shop yesterday, and the order was in chaos. Then, members of the Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps persuaded the people to disperse and maintain order. Moreover, the shop was willing to donate 26 bags of rice to relieve the refugees. Then, members of the corps transported them by car to the local association and ordered them to be transferred to the Great World Refugee Shelter for the refugees to eat. In addition, the associated Xin Da Rice Shop also said that it would donate more than 100 bags of rice to relieve the refugees.</p>
<p>Refugees Rob Rice</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon at Aolihe Road and Anna Jin Road in the French Concession, five small carts (i.e., Yangjiao carts) full of white rice, each carrying about five dan, were traveling from north to south. Refugees saw this along the way and immediately went forward to question whether there was an invoice and where it was being sent. If they could point it out, they would be allowed to pass. Otherwise, this rice stone must be helping the enemy. Therefore, the refugees rushed forward and completely robbed the five carts of white rice.</p>
<p>150 bags of rice were stolen from No. 15, Wen Zhou Road. 190 dan of rice were stolen from Jia Yuan Sheng Rice Shop on Tian Zao Road. More than ten people, including Ma Xiaogen, Liu Dingbang, Qian Caixi, and Lu Daan, were arrested by the police and sent to the court for severe punishment yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Punishment for Raising Prices</p>
<p>Lawyer Wang Boxian recently proposed to the Shanghai Lawyers Association Temporary Emergency Conference to suggest that the Legislative Yuan quickly formulate a law to punish merchants for raising prices during national disasters. Merchants who are mad with greed often take advantage of incidents to monopolize and hoard essential goods for people's lives and raise prices, which directly affects the lives of the entire people. There is no different from speaking for the enemy. If there is no unified method of sanctions, how can we provide relief?</p>
<p>Pan Yutai Will Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>Hong Chengtai Rice Shop at the Wujiaochang entrance in Caojiadu is opened by a person named Pan Yutai, who used to do business with various Japanese factories in western Shanghai. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, he closed his doors and no longer sold rice. He wrote on the door that the rice was sold out and no longer traded. In fact, he hoarded the rice upstairs and sent the old stewards to transport the rice to the Shanghai Silk Company every night, and then the Japanese tried to transport it to Zhabei. This method has been going on for a long time because the transportation takes place late at night, and the residents have not noticed it. Previously, because the concession announced martial law at 10:00 PM, he had to transport it earlier. He was discovered by our residents on the left and right, and the conspiracy was reported to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau by the people yesterday morning. The police immediately tried to open the inside of the shop, and the rice was piled up like a mountain, completely hidden upstairs. After the police discovered it, they immediately ordered the shop's clerks to open the door to the market, and on the one hand, they escorted the accountant to the headquarters for investigation. It is heard that the shop owner Pan Yutai is hiding in a certain place on Juluda Road in the French Concession. The authorities have decided to find a way to arrest and severely punish him.</p>
<h3>Japanese Policemen Robbed Rice Shops</h3>
<p>Threatening with Guns to Force the Sale of Rice; The Crowd Rushed to the Scene, But He Escaped</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, at the Daxin Rice Shop at the intersection of Sandanyuan Road and Huanlong Road in the French Concession of this city, a Japanese policeman from the Public Concession suddenly broke in with a gun, robbed the shop owner, and forced him to sell white rice. The shop owner was unable to resist under the threat of a gun and was in great danger. Fortunately, passers-by discovered it and gathered outside the shop. The crowd was furious and wanted to enter and punish him severely. When a detective saw it, he went forward to drive him away. Just as Chinese policemen also rushed to the scene after hearing the news, the thug saw that the detectives were gathering and escaped through the back door.</p>
<h3>Postal Services Are Maintained as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>Only Parcel Exchanges Are Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Post Office, postal services will be maintained as much as possible, but only ordinary registered and express mail will be accepted for the time being. Parcel and exchange services will be temporarily suspended. All branches in the Public Concession and the French Concession will still be open as usual. For notifications, please call 40395 to contact the director's office of the Postal Administration. Those who wish to pick up private mailbox mail can enter and exit through the large iron gate of the North Suzhou Road Post Office.</p>
<h3>Common Sense During Air Raids</h3>
<p>During fierce air battles, shrapnel from anti-aircraft guns and stray bullets from machine guns often injure people. Many refugees and shop employees and residents in the Zujie area wander the streets, looking up to watch during aerial battles, which makes them vulnerable to stray bullets. It is even more dangerous to sit on the roof and watch. Yesterday, the relief committee organized by all sectors of the city dispatched members to warn shops and residents not to leave their homes during air raids. Those who are traveling in vehicles must also stop and lean against strong walls or crawl on the ground to avoid danger.</p>
<h3>Miss Pettus Proves That There Were No Chinese Soldiers at Shanghai University</h3>
<p>The Japanese Want to Cover Up Their Actions of Destroying Culture</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Pao has twice published the Japanese military authorities' remarks that Shanghai University harbored Chinese soldiers who were engaged in renting and attacking, and that the Japanese army planned to bombard it, and claimed that a foreigner from a neutral country had proved that the university harbored Chinese soldiers. Yesterday, the newspaper republished a letter from Miss Pettus, an accountant at the university, asking the women and children in the school to withdraw on August 12 at the order of the US consul. Only two Americans lived in the school, one of whom was Miss Pettus. The next day, due to the dangerous situation, the American flag was raised over the school. At around 2:00 PM, she received a notice from the US consul, instructing the two Americans to leave the school as well. In order to protect the school, the two decided to stay in the school as long as possible. At around 5:00 PM, the shelling suddenly started. At that time, there were about 150 people in the school, including Chinese, most of whom were guarding the school buildings. Chinese soldiers never ambushed in the school to snipe. The Chinese soldiers did not fire at the school either. We dare to declare that until people were forced to leave by gunfire from outside the field, no Chinese soldiers were sniping in the school. After the Japanese soldiers controlled the area around the school, the shooting from the Qiujiang Road Wharf weakened, and the people decided to leave the school. At 9:00 PM, they passed through the Japanese line and safely arrived at the university's business school on Yuanmingyuan Road. Fifty workers and their families are currently staying in the school. Judging from this, the Japanese military authorities' claim that Chinese soldiers were ambushed at Shanghai University is purely to cover up their barbaric act of destroying culture.</p>
<h3>All Hospitals in the Northeast District Have Been Emptied</h3>
<p>All staff and patients in the Public Works Bureau Patrol Hospital (on Huade Road in the East District) were completely evacuated yesterday. Although there were difficulties at the time, it was successfully completed. The staff and patients in the Gongji Hospital on North Suzhou Road also left last night. Currently, the staff and patients living in the Public Works Bureau's Northeast District hospitals, except for a few mentally ill patients and the staff who take care of them in the Huade Road Prison Hospital, have all been moved to safe areas.</p>
<h3>Inland Water Traffic is Blocked</h3>
<p>The Report of Opening the Shanghai-Zhenjiang Route is Inaccurate</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, inland water traffic has been cut off. The report said that the Inland Water Steamboat Association is planning to open the Shanghai-Zhenjiang route, which is not accurate. According to the person in charge of the association, the association originally had considerable plans for the traffic on each line after the outbreak of the war. However, the steamboats in various places were blocked from coming to Shanghai. Therefore, so far, there is not a single small steamboat docked in Shanghai. The pre-determined plan cannot be implemented either. The association is now trying to find ways to open steamboats to Shanghai. When the time comes, the detailed methods will be announced.</p>
<h3>Two Typhoons in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Moving Northwest-West; The Course is Still Unclear</p>
<p>Two new typhoons have risen in the Pacific. According to the Observatory's report yesterday, the first typhoon has reached 34 degrees north latitude and 116 degrees east longitude, with its center within 120 nautical miles of the reported azimuth, and its direction is unclear. The second typhoon has reached 17 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude, moving northwest-west, with its center also within 120 nautical miles. The wind is moving very slowly and seems to be pushing towards our coast.</p>
<h3>Central Savings Association Lottery</h3>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of war in the city, all industries have been stagnant. Due to the lottery relationship, the Central Savings Association is still operating as usual. The number of people paying and joining the association at the association's new building at No. 1 Tianjin Road and the office on Xiafei Road was quite crowded yesterday and the day before yesterday. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the association held a lottery at the Pudong Fellow Association on Aiduya Road. Hundreds of depositors from all walks of life attended, and directors and supervisors of the Central Trust Bureau, supervisory committee members of the association, and accountants were present to supervise. The special prize number was 3328, with a prize money of 25,834 yuan. It is heard that it was jointly won by two depositors from Guangzhou and Shanghai, Zhu and Yuan. All prizes, large and small, can be collected from today.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong and the Yellow Sea are hot, and the northeast wind is changing from gentle to strong. The weather in the East China Sea is changing from hot to cloudy, and the wind direction is uncertain and sharp due to the small typhoon east of Naha moving northwest-west or northwest. There are rainstorms in the Yangtze River basin, and the wind direction is uncertain. The typhoon in the Pacific will move northwest-west. The center of the Yang wind reached within about 120 miles of 27 degrees north latitude and 128 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM. The wind strength is unknown. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in the city was 8.7 degrees, and the lowest was 76.5 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 90.5 degrees, and the lowest was 75.0 degrees.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, We have just learned from our member, Futai Rice Shop on Fulu Road, that the newspapers of August 15 carried a news item stating that Futai Rice Shop actually stopped selling grain to the Chinese people and secretly sold it to the enemy in large quantities. We were shocked when we read it. After investigation, our rice has been sold out, and there is a Yongyi Rice Shop in Zhabei that happens to borrow a rice warehouse at No. 13 in the back lane near our shop. The people misunderstood this and wantonly destroyed it. The facts reported in the newspaper are completely inconsistent. It is a matter of business reputation. Please investigate and forward it to various newspapers for correction. According to this, our association sent personnel to investigate. According to the report of the shop, it is indeed the fact. Therefore, we have prepared a special letter to your newspaper, please correct it immediately. Sincerely, Shanghai Rice Industry Association</p>
<h3>Letter from Huiluo Company</h3>
<p>A Chinese evening newspaper carried a message saying that our company had a machine gun mounted on the roof. This statement is completely false. We are deeply afraid of causing resentment among the Chinese people. Please make a statement on our behalf in your newspaper. Your newspaper can also send one or two staff members to inspect the roof of our company.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Rear Area Sentiment Amidst the War of Resistance Against Japan (Part One of One)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>The Days of Liberation</p>
<p>"Our days of liberation are coming soon, right?"</p>
<p>This was a popular saying, a unanimous "sentence," that I heard everywhere after the authorities announced their determination to resist Japan following the Lugouqiao Incident. I was returning to Shanghai from Kunming in Tiannan, passing through the provinces of Sichuan and Hubei.</p>
<p>This so-called "days of liberation," although still a hope, is not without basis, judging from the favorable public opinion and events in various quarters, especially the rear area's "unity of purpose," flourishing and vigorous, and the national spirit that seems about to unleash a flower of national liberation and freedom.</p>
<p>We originally knew that the ferocious demon glaring at us was none other than the enemy's voracious and shameless conspiracy, and their beastly plundering. However, we need not panic, nor need we overthink. We must further recognize the great strength that we ourselves possess, namely the 450 million people, the bullets within the nation’s ordnance pouch, and the full of hot blood that everyone has long stored to a saturation level. As long as we can launch a broad, sustained, and nationwide war of resistance, then this demon that directly endangers the life of the Chinese nation and indirectly destroys world peace and happiness will inevitably suffer an irreparable and severe lesson in the end, and reap the evil consequences of its own militarism and self-immolation through war.</p>
<p>Now, the prelude to the nationwide war of resistance has resolutely begun under a situation of "unbearable indignation." The heroic soldiers on the front lines, their reports of capturing generals and seizing flags, and killing the enemy to achieve results, are constantly being transmitted through newspapers. However, what is the degree of the rear area's morale, which is mutually related to and reflects the tragic and intense morale of the front lines? What kind of effect can it have? This is certainly a major issue worth noting.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to introduce more practical information in this regard. It may not be without a contribution of "drawing inferences from one instance" to the review of the rear area's lineup in this nationwide war of resistance.</p>
<p>Kunming, Tiannan</p>
<p>Let's start with Kunming, the starting point of this trip: it was originally located on the extreme border of the South, tens of thousands of miles away from North China. If North China is the current front line, then Yunnan is the current rear area. However, although the Yunnan region is in the rear area, the enthusiastic emotions repeatedly aroused by the national crisis have always been no less than those of the front lines. Especially when the Lugouqiao Incident first broke out, once it was disclosed in the local newspaper's extra edition and spread around, it did not take long for the entire city of Kunming to be shrouded in an atmosphere of grief, indignation, and excitement! The next day, raising donations for the troops, voluntarily contributing one day's income, increasing public servants' duties and student military training were all rapidly emerging facts.</p>
<p>At the same time, some stores in the market that also sold silk and linen fabrics made by the enemy, as well as stalls selling scattered enemy goods such as "Wei Huo 'San Dan' bedbug insecticide" and "Eastern toys," have successively discovered a gift like "gold from heaven." It was not a warning letter, nor was it a bomb, but a "canned food" of human excrement that was extremely easy to splash and volatilize. Those who received it truly had the feeling of "unable to refuse, yet ashamed to accept."</p>
<p>Some young students have automatically gone to the countryside to do propaganda work. Liang Mochen, the commander of the artillery regiment in Wujia Chang (twenty miles south of the city), even saw a tall and upright young man with a loud voice giving a speech to countless graves on a tomb dam. The etiquette and titles were the same as in a meeting hall, attracting many villagers to surround him on the left, right, and rear in a large arc. When Liang first saw him, he thought he was mentally ill, but after hearing him mention in fragments that "if the enemy country implements its southward policy, Yunnan will not be spared," he concluded that he was a patriotic youth. Whether the young man's technique of publicizing the national crisis was appropriate or not, we can put aside for the moment, but the importance that Yunnan youth attaches to the national crisis can be seen from this.</p>
<p>However, the methods of the rear area to cope with the national crisis are certainly far from enough based solely on the above-mentioned social phenomena. What is the Yunnan government's response situation? This is certainly a topic that should be written about.</p>
<p>I believe that the greatest responsibilities of the rear area authorities during the outbreak of the war can be summarized into two items: ㊀ to provide the front lines with as much material and manpower as possible, and ㊁ to strive to maintain local security. Yunnan is rich in products and can still maintain a state of "self-sufficiency." All military and political power within Gansu province is concentrated in the hands of Provincial Chairman and Pacification Director Long Zhi Zhou. All administrative and military affairs are carried out effectively, and the results are considerable. The reporter has met with Mr. Long several times. His view on the Sino-Japanese problem is that sooner or later, a war is inevitable. Although Japan is a strong country, as long as China can wage a protracted war, it will not hesitate to exhaust all its material and human resources. When the fierce fighting has reached a considerable degree, causing the enemy's combat power to be exhausted, the final victory will ultimately belong to us. However, at this critical moment of national survival, regardless of distance, regardless of age, everyone should contribute everything they have to the country in order to strengthen the power of a sustained war of resistance.</p>
<p>In addition, on the day before I was about to leave Kunming, at the "Number One Hot Spring in the World" in Anning, I also met Mr. Lu Shui Heng, the current Provincial Party Committee member and right-hand man of Mr. Long. He also said: Yunnan is connected to the British and French territories and is fortunate to be at peace. All of the tens of thousands of regular troops are always preparing for battle, ready to serve on the front lines of the war of resistance. As long as the central government's order for deployment arrives in the morning, they can be mobilized to the north in the evening. As for the responsibility for the security of the province, it will be borne by the standing teams in each county, so there is no need to worry. Afterwards, I also met with Chief of the General Staff Liao Pin Zhuo and Division Commander Zhang Yun Peng, and learned that the attitude of the general soldiers in Yunnan province closely matched the sentiments expressed by Mr. Long and Mr. Lu. From my observation, I see that in recent years, Yunnan province has implemented conscription and strict training. Soldiers who have completed their two-year term of service and retired still receive subsidies to support local security. In addition, there have been no natural disasters for many years, and the rice harvest has been abundant. The general social economy is relatively well-off. Therefore, the above-mentioned authorities' willingness to devote all the province's human and material resources to jointly overcome the national crisis is indeed a sincere and responsible statement.</p>
