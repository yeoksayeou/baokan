<h3>我軍全線形勢優越敵各路反攻均遭擊退</h3>
<p>中央特派大員督戰士氣大振　敵機各處投彈被我擊落兩架</p>
<p>昨日各路戰情如下、㊀羅店至瀏河一帶　我軍頗佔優勢、敵軍在我重兵嚴密包圍中、敵雖屢圖突圍、卒不得逞、我方有大員在該綫指揮督戰、士氣壯狂、殲滅頑敵、極有把握㊁吳淞方面、昨日自晨至晚、敵雖憑猛烈之砲火與飛機掩護、企圖繼續登陸、經我軍奮勇痛擊、無隙可乘、㊂張華浜一帶、殘敵昨曾屢圖衝破我軍之圍、以我佈置嚴密、終歸失敗、㊃深夜敵謀反攻寶山路一帶我軍陣地、雙方各以大砲轟擊、一度激戰之後、敵不支而退、㊄南市方面、雖曾來敵機轟炸、但於我軍事方面毫無影響、</p>
<p>昨日（二十八日）下午八時官方發表戰報云、㊀滬杭公路柘林(在金山嘴與南匯間）海面、泊有敵艦數艘、二十六日曾先遣敵兵三十餘人登陸、因我駐軍佯作不知、繼有敵兵二百餘名、蜂擁登岸、我軍在其立足未隱之際、突以輕重機槍掃射、除少數逃回外、餘均殲滅、㊁月浦敵軍巳被我軍擊退、㊂二十五日午後四時、在月浦天空發生空戰、我機九架包圍敵機四架、結果我擊落敵機一架、㊃羅店敵巳散退、惟漢奸娼蹶、敢於警戒區內發槍、並爲敵機作信號、我正嚴竣鎭壓中、㊄閘北方面日來僅有小接觸、㊅川沙·獅子林·蕰藻浜·張華浜之敵·我正集中雄厚兵力包圍中、短期內不難解决、</p>
<p>確息、瀏河方面巳行登陸之敵、經我軍予以重創後、巳露不支狀、正逐漸向沿江邊潰退、我軍步步進逼勢成包圍、故敵軍巳無頑抗之力、</p>
<p>南匯沿海一帶、日前敵軍一度登陸後、卽經我軍包圍殲滅、迄猶未敢再犯、茲悉在南匯縣屬之鄧家碼頭、又發現敵艦數艘、并有小艇若干艘、有企圖登陸模樣、我軍巳嚴行戒備云、</p>
<h3>昨晚我軍砲轟虹口敵軍</h3>
<p>標的準確敵方損失奇重　江灣一帶雙方砲火激烈</p>
<p>昨晚十一時十分左右、我浦東方面、爲策應吳淞虹口一帶我軍進攻敵軍之勢、頻發重砲、向敵艦敵軍作猛烈之轟擊、予敵軍以重創、當時聲如巨雷、震動全埠、在二十五分鐘間、發砲計達五十餘發、停泊浦江水面之三敵艦、曾起還擊、但均失效、至十一時四十分、始漸疏稀、</p>
<p>今晨零點十五分、沿北四川路以至江灣路一帶敵軍、忽以散兵綫向我各陣地偸襲、當時我軍均靜伏以待、俟敵兵密集之際、卽以步槍機關槍掃射、結果敵謀不遂、鎩羽而退、我軍追擊之後、仍守原防、嚴陣以待、</p>
<p>中央社云、北四川路底江灣路一帶之敵、昨日傍晚向我猛烈反攻、我軍沉着應戰、並以機關槍密集掃射、激戰達一小時許、敵軍傷亡重大、不支而退、入晚我軍卽以重砲向北四川路底之敵軍司令部轟擊、砲火猛烈、標的準確、敵方損失奇重、約歷兩小時許、砲聲始漸稀少云、</p>
<p>張華浜敵反攻挫敗</p>
<p>此次張華浜及羅店附近一帶之血戰、其激烈爲滬戰爆發以來所未有、據由前方歸來者談、我軍士兵之不眠不食、奮勇殺敵者、均在二晝夜以上、而犧牲之壯烈、亦得曾有、惟以交通不便、且砲火猛烈、以致傷者轉側於地、乏人救護、探望各界注意及此、急謀救護、以冀壯士之得早日痊愈、而重上前綫殺敵也、</p>
<p>中央社云、張華浜方面之敵、續有援軍登陸、自前晚以迄昨晨、（廿八日）數度向我反攻、當經我軍奮勇迎頭痛擊、敵未得逞、</p>
<p>張華浜方面一部敵軍、仍盤據於車站附近及兩路機廠等處房屋內、在敵艦掩護之下、屢圖衝破我軍之圍、以期發展陣地、終以我軍佈置嚴密、未能達到目的、今晨二時據確報、楊樹浦底及滬江大學一帶、敵軍行動甚爲忙迫、察其形勢、似有向軍工路北面進襲模樣、我方守軍、已嚴加注意、</p>
<p>敵軍向我北戰反攻</p>
<p>中央社云、敵機於昨日午後五時半、曾飛往北站轟炸、旋於昨晚十一時半、北四川路方面之敵、向我北站方面反攻、頗爲猛烈、我軍當卽奮勇迎擊、激戰至今晨零時十五分敵軍不支而退、</p>
<p>我軍成大包圍形勢</p>
<p>中央社云、日交戰事重心外移、楊樹浦方面巳趨於沉寂、該綫我軍中路於十七日攻克敵海軍操塲之重要根據點後、曾乘勝追擊、深入敵軍陣地、兩度進至東百老匯路之匯山碼頭、並分東西兩路進攻、以致找軍陣綫突出如三角形、左右及前方均有受敵之虞、在軍事上認爲大忌、我爲戰略關係、將突出部份向後撤退、使成弧形之大包圍形勢、嚴密守備、北四川路及八字橋方面之情勢依舊、雙方仍在嚴陣對峙中、</p>
<p>吳淞擊落敵機兩架</p>
<p>中央社頃據乘大來輪船公司林肯總統號輪抵滬之西人談、渠等所搭林肯號輪於昨晨抵淞口、正候太來公司專派小輪前來接送來滬之除、突見有日機十二架、分隊自口外起飛、於浦面盤旋一周後、預備襲擊吳淞方面我後方陣地、當被我高射砲從容轟擊、其中有兩彈竟吿命中、擊中敵機兩架、其中一架、當時卽行墮落、另一架被我擊中機箱、時該機猶謀掙扎逃逸、奈飛行未久、油箱火起、遂遭焚燬、終亦下落、時正昨日上午十一時左右也、</p>
<p>昨晨敵艦砲攻浦東</p>
<p>昨晨六時起、停泊楊樹浦江面之敵艦十六艘、因瀏河羅店等處、敵軍節節失利、曾以所有火力、向我浦東方面集中砲轟、意冀牽制我軍力、當時我砲兵遂加還擊、相戰許久、敵意我力欠厚、乃更於上午九時許、遺大批敵軍向浦東□□□處襲擊、企圖登岸、當時我守軍鎭靜伏待、佯作無備、見敵履岸、卽四伏齊出、萬槍俱發、立刻將敵擊退、當時溺死者亦不少、並被我軍截獲軍用品等一大批、敵見我方有備、卽不敢再侵、雙方砲擊、亦逐漸疏落、至下午五時完全停止、</p>
<p>敵方陸軍登陸接防</p>
<p>據關係方面所得到之報吿、敵方增援陸軍、在楊樹浦區各碼頭紛紛登陸、並起運軍械輜重甚多、蓋敵海軍陸戰隊被我痛擊之後、士氣銷沉、故改由陸軍接防、昨日傍晚虹口方面曾有激烈之前哨戰、以防我軍之進襲、現我方陣綫異常鞏固、敵圖反攻、决難展開、</p>
<p>大隊敵機轟炸吳淞</p>
<p>懸意旗之商輸龍山號、昨日上午十一時許、從吳淞進口來滬、船抵淞口、見日飛機數隊、每隊爲重轟炸機四架、正飛到吳淞向砲台灣及吳淞車站一帶、擲彈轟炸、隆隆之聲、響徹雲霄、龍山不能前進、卽停車漸避、計先後經日飛機拋擲之炸彈、共有四十餘顆、歷一小時許、各日機始向東飛去、龍山輪乃得從吳淞駛滬、又據該輪船員言、吳淞口外日艦不過十餘艘、浦江內亦有十餘艘、其載運援軍來滬之大型運輸船、爲一三二號、一五○號、一六○號等、巳經將船內部隊上陸、刻下空船尚留停在吳淞口云、</p>
<p>昨日浦江敵艦調查</p>
<p>泊浦敵艦、昨日突見增加、蓋日前大部集結淞口之敵艦、於昨日起、已大半駛回浦江也、綜計昨日下午三時至六時、記者赴浦口及淞口調査所得、集結淞口之敵艦、昨日僅餘九艘、而泊駐浦江中之敵艦、竟又增至二十六艘之多、其停泊情形概如下述、計吳淞鎭浦面巡洋艦驅逐艦各一艘、蘊藻浜第三十二號運輸艦一艘、第六十號運輸艦一艘、濬浦局浦面第一百五十號運輸艦一艘、電燈廠浦面第二十三號砲艦二艘、另一艘名號已塗去、高橋浦面驅逐艦一艘、虬江碼頭驅逐二艘、東溝浦面驅逐艦一艘、裕豐紗廠浦面驅逐艦一艘、亞細亞火油棧浦面驅逐艦一艘、蘭路浦面砲艦一艘、自來水廠浦面驅逐艦一艘、新三井碼頭驅逐艦一艘、一號浮筒至九號浮筒敵艦共七艘、（出雲旗艦仍泊二號浮筒亦在內）三菱碼頭驅逐艦二艘、共爲二十六艘、合淞口外之九艘、總計爲三十五艘、當記者在浦中視察時、見兩岸各碼頭情况、甚爲凄淸、除大阪碼頭有敵軍十餘、蘊藻浜附近尚有殘餘敵軍甚夥、往來甚爲忙碌外、其餘各處竟寂無一人、浦江中且時有滬東區民衆被敵軍槍殺、後將其屍體棄入浦江、逐波飄盪、爲數甚夥、狀殊凄慘、敵軍之殘暴獸行、及其屢傷我無辜人民、此亦力證之一也、</p>
<p>浦東情形尚屬安靜</p>
<p>昨日報載浦東陸家嘴五福弄、發現日便衣隊五十餘人云云、茲經調査、該地極爲安靜、所傳係出於誤會、且浦東我軍力雄厚、敵方任何計劃、均難得逞、</p>
<p>浦東張家浜日淸公司大阪棧房、經兩度大火後、焚燬貨棧兩所、因餘火未熄、昨日午後三時、又延及另一棧房、因棧內無人管理、愈燃愈烈、不久遂冒穿棧頂、烈熖飛麟、黑煙高冲空際、焚燒至傍晚、始漸衰減、但餘燼未熄、又左隣三菱公司、亦於前日火燃棧房一所、棧貨損失頗鉅、</p>
<p>我方空軍兩度夜襲</p>
<p>昨晚十一時、我空軍飛至浦江上空、襲擊敵艦、敵軍高射砲卽倉皇亂射、至今晨三時十分左右、我空軍再度出現、盤旋空際、久久未去、敵艦高射砲雖發如聯珠、我機仍從容環繞高空數週、安然而返、</p>
<h3>羅店激戰經過</h3>
<p>敵軍傷亡三千餘人　現在鎭西隔河對峙</p>
<p>連日羅店戰况劇烈、實開滬戰未有之紀錄、羅店全鎭受砲火洗禮者達三分之二以上、一片焦土、慘不忍睹、敵軍利用飛機重砲、掩護作戰、故恒於拂曉時總攻、而我軍則於晚間進取、乘敵不備、全綫猛撲、故敵軍受我夜襲之犧牲者、不可數計、羅店以北、木杓鎭、沈家橋等處、雙方激戰未已、我軍士氣旺盛、以一當十、敵軍士無鬥志、僅憑其戰器之精利、决不得逞、</p>
<p>中央社云、盛橋木杓鎭陳家行以迄瀏河附近一帶之敵、在重胞及飛機掩護之下、迭向我軍陣地反攻、經我軍奮勇進擊、屢進屢退、敵方所受損失極大、我方犧牲亦巨、迄今晨止、雙方在羅店西北約四里許之某小河隔岸對峙中、並悉小川沙方面之敵、巳在陸上安置重砲、企圖掩護敵軍前進云、</p>
<p>漢奸助虐開門揖盜</p>
<p>本報記者今晨晤及自羅店方面逃滬之難民多入、據吿、自敵軍在該處偷襲登陸後加之漢奸助虐、開門揖盜、致全鎭民衆無逃避、而慘遭殺戮者、頗不乏人再經數盡夜之激戰、全鎭、市廛星宇、殆己燬去四分之三、余等逃出者、約二千人以上、均係昕夕步行百餘里之途程、始獲安然抵滬、現聞敵軍已被我軍逐退至海濱附近、但尚有不少難民蟄居各處、刻已開始設法集中、至交通便利地帶、然後再用汽車運滬牧容云云、</p>
<p>某軍官談激戰經過</p>
<p>中央社云、記者昨晤在羅店指揮作戰之某軍官、承吿以敵軍偷渡登陸之經過甚祥、據稱敵軍大量援軍抵滬後、屢圖登陸未果、終於廿五日上午九時、得漢奸之引導、由小河偷渡登陸、計有一旅之衆約四千人、而我駐防隊伍則僅二千人、我以寡敵衆、頗處於不利之地位、但將士忠勇抵抗甚力、前仆後繼、死守待援、終以喪亡慘重、於午後二時不支而退、是投我損失三分之二、待一小時許、我援軍開到、卽併力猛攻、敵立陣未固、驟遭我反攻、倉卒應戰、卒亦不支、退出鎭外約八里之處木杓鎭一帶、此役、我軍士奮勇、有進無退、予敵人以重創、計敵之傷亡約有二千人、而我亦損失忠勇將士約八百人、現敵憑小河構築工事固守、我亦嚴陣以待、敵連日以飛機及海軍大砲掩護進攻、均未得逞、</p>
<p>鎭外敵軍遺屍遍野</p>
<p>上海電報局之報差兩人、前日乘坐自行車赴羅店投遞電報、據謂羅店鎭外附近一帶、均無敵踪、僅見鎭外敵軍遺屍滿地、想見該處戰事之激烈、及敵方傷亡之重大、該報差兩人旋於投遞電報之後、卽循原路而返、詎意甫離羅店不遠、竟遭敵機之轟炸、兩人因而受傷、幸傷勢尚輕、當晚返滬就醫、此兩人冒險服務之精神、殊堪欽佩云、</p>
<h3>指揮正面作戰部隊張治中升總可令</h3>
<p>江防部隊另派大員指揮　楊司令談誓必殲滅頑敵</p>
<p>（中央社云）上海戒嚴司令官楊虎氏、昨日發表談話云、近日上海漢奸造謠、一般民衆不明眞相、常有不安狀態、滬戰發生以來、賴我忠勇將士、一體用命、敵人節節敗退、已成强駑之末、連日戰况順利、張司令官文伯、業奉中央明令晉升爲總司令、對於上海戰局、由張司令負全責指揮、殘敵殲滅之期、指日可待、至我軍左翼方面、亦另有中央大員負責指揮、勝利自在把握中、望我全市民衆一體鎭定、勿驕勿餒、切勿輕信漢奸造謠、實爲至要云云、</p>
<p>中央社戰地記者、於昨（廿八）日下午九時、往謁張治中將軍於××軍次、時張將軍正在指揮部隊作戰、極形忙碌、但精神甚爲旺盛、記者叩以最近前綫作戰情形、張氏含笑致答、大意謂、“本人奉令指揮上海方面正面作戰部隊、新近忝膺×××××總司令之職、雖自維材力棉薄、但國家當此存亡絕續之關頭、分屬軍人、惟有誓死效命、馳驅疆塲、以殺敵致果爲唯一之任務、目前戰爭、僅爲全面戰鬥之開始、此後艱難苦鬥、胥賴我忠勇將士之不斷犧牲、與全國民衆之熱烈之支援、本人對於所負之使命、日夜戰兢自凜、不敢稍懈也、現敵人雖尚披猖、惟中央早有縝密之凖備、無論如何、終不得逞、望新聞界轉吿國人、謂本人可以負責保證戰爭之最後勝利、必屬諸我也、”記者繼詢以江防部隊實力是否充分、張氏以堅定之口語作答、“現在江防部隊、已由中央派大員負責指揮、現有實力、决可擊退敵人可毋慮也、”記者又問、盛傳虹口方面我軍已略向後撤、信乎、張氏答稱、“虹口方面、我軍現在决無撤後理由與事實、至於原有陣綫之整理部署、則爲戰爭常有之事、不能認爲撤退也、記者見張氏處理軍事、手不停筆、耳不離話機、不便再有煩凟、因興辭、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>堅持抗戰勿憂勿懼</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>自從敵軍在虹口與楊樹浦區迭受挫折。不得不改變戰略。在長江沿岸肆行侵擾以來有些人見到戰爭重心的轉移忽然引起了憂懼的觀念。這種心理上的搖動一方面是由於敵人利用漢奸。造作謠言。淆亂衆聽。另一方面則因敵軍一部分確已在吳淞瀏河登陸。一度到達羅店。而我軍在江灣閘北的戰綫。也以守勢代替原來的攻勢，這以外。敵機的濫施轟炸。與敵艦的封鎖海岸。也引起了一些人的不安。然而在這抗戰開始的嚴重時期。我們應當指出。這種心理上的搖動。乃是絕對不可有的。我們只有堅持抗戰。才能獲取最後的勝利。</p>
<p>關於敵人戰略上的改變與我方陣地的重行布置。我們首先必須知道。我國素來沒有堅固的海防。要在漫長的海岸綫上阻止敵軍的登陸。原是困難的事情。吳淞寶山瀏河一帶。海岸泥士鬆濕。不宜建築防禦工事。所以我方的退守一二里。並不是值得憂懼的事情，而由於後方陣地的變動。同樣使江灣閘北方面的戰綫不能不易攻為守。也是當然之理</p>
<p>不過在這次的抗戰中。我們必須愼重守定一個原則。卽這次的對日抗戰。必須為全面的戰爭。也必須為持久的戰爭。祇有這樣的戰爭。才能在最後致敵人於死命。而現在敵人的濫施空中轟炸宣布海岸封鎖，卽欲在我國抗敵開始之際。搖動我們的戰門意志。使全面與持久的抗戰。不能實現。然而實際上。我國既少繁鬧的工業城市。又無海外的投資市市敵人這種空中與海上威脅。我方除了準備下必不可免的生命與物質土的犧牲外。是不必有任何顧忌的。</p>
<p>在目前我們最急要的事情。乃是堅定抗戰的意志。以抵制敵人暴力的威脅。在一二八戰爭中。我們曾於淞滬彈丸之地。與敵軍周旋了五十餘日。現在我們經過了五年多的準備。難道會不如當時。我們更應該知道華北的戰爭。在性質上至少與淞滬的戰爭同等重要。而現在津浦平漢兩綫的大規模抗爭。還沒有完全展開。使敵人得以集中力量。一面威脅上海。一面壓迫南口。所以在目前。我們决不能以一小部分陣地或戰略上的變化。引起任何的憂懼。而應以最堅强的决心推進全面的抗戰。發動持久的抗戰。使兇暴野蠻的敵人。陷於最後的崩潰而後已。</p>

<h3>英政府决定對日提强硬抗議</h3>
<p>傳具有哀的美敦性質　英參贊來華代大使職</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於英國駐華大使許閣森爵士、遭日本飛機襲擊受傷一事、頃據官塲方面宣稱、外相艾登會與現在巴爾摩拉城休假之張伯倫首相、互通電話多次、當經决定、由英國政府向日本政府提出最强硬之抗議、抗議內容、將於明日或星期一日發表、聞英國政府此項交涉、共性質當較平常正式抗議、更為嚴重、（二十八日哈丸斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英國今日要求日本、對於英國駐華大使許閣森被日軍飛機擊傷事、予以“充份之滿意”、此項要求具有哀的美敦書性質、係訓令英駐日代辦向日政府提出、據美聯社所得確息、此項要求使日本在“失面子”或引起英國憤怒二者之間擇一而行、日本如拒絕此項要求、卽為侵犯英王喬治六世個人之尊嚴、此項耍求在東京何時提出、此間尚未得確報、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英駐華大使館參贊賀氏、頃已乘飛機啟程前往中國、俾在許閣森大使傷勢未愈之時期內、主打駐華大使館事務、（中央社二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英報預測、英政府因許閣森大使受傷事、向東京提出之抗議文、措詞必甚强硬、或將要求賠償、泰晤士報稱、關於此不幸事件之上海最後詳報、尚未到達、大約今日當可抵此、然後英政府卽将論令駐日代辦向日政府交涉、泰晤士報外交記者謂、日方若于解釋言論、不獨不能減輕英人義憤、反使英人對此暴行、愈增憤懣、日方所發日本陸軍得悉中國高級軍官、定於是日行經京滬公路一節、直無異謂“吾人非欲射擊英大使、但吾人謀暗殺吾人並未與之斷絕外交關係之鄰國元首”而已、至於華人僭用英旗之說、亦殊不足重視、無論如何、日方絕未有僅因若干華人舉動為日方所不愜意而遽轟攻外人乘車之理由、以言日艦隊封鎖中國海岸一說、此事猶待證實、似艦隊司令所傳之命令、與日外務省所發不擾及外人船𨾏之言論、顯有互相出入之處、惟無論如何、危機四伏、日本究有何種權利可封鎖其並未對之正式宣戰之國家海岸、此乃大堪疑問者也云、（中央社二十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>英大使許閣森傷勢經過良好</h3>
<p>宏恩醫院昨晚發表報告　字林西報斥日虛偽宣傳</p>
<p>（本報特訊）英國駐華大使、許閣森、二十六日乘車自京來滬、中途被日機用機槍掃射、受傷入宏恩醫院醫治、大使病體如何、頗為中外人士所注意、昨晨本報記者往訪於宏恩醫院、據該院英醫談英大使前晚病體經過、甚為良好會有若干小時之安眠、昨晨情形、仍能保持如是良好情狀、短時間內可不致有何特殊變化、</p>

<p>此次英大使許閣森爵士在由京來滬途中、為日飛機發機關槍擊傷、由大使署隨員證明、日人乃無可抵賴、故東京日政府發言人與上海日當局均向英當局道歉、乃昨據字林報載稱東京J.V.J.與J.K.J.兩無綫電臺之播音者、竞於八月二十六日下午九時以英語播音謂英大使乃為暴虐之華兵擊傷云云、字林報為主持公道起見持揭發其奸、並載短評、加以抨擊、希望東京日當局從事矯正此顚倒事實之舉動、並謂據電傳消息、日當局對於英大使汽車之被擊、雖已正式道歉、然日本民衆恐尚不知真正事實、且英語播音之消息、必由日當局用日文告知其國民之情報譯成、果爾　則似應請日當局重行考慮其破壞國際禮貌之態度云、就此事觀之、此次日飛機所擲下之炸彈、幸未命中許大使之汽車、否則諸人慘遭非命、無一證人、日當局定指乃中國飛機所為中國雖百喙亦無以目辯矣、再、昨日字林報並載有社論題曰“盲愚”、評論日飛機攻擊許大使汽車事、對於日當局為飛機辯護之言、層層加以駁難、惟措詞溫和、遠不若前論大世界前炸彈案之憤激、但其中有一語頗堪注意　文曰“假使被攻汽車中之来者稍欠重要、則日當局適当迅速所致之道歉必恐將遲遲不即至也、”故乘車者若為尋常外人、則日當局不特不予道歉、且將想然置之、視若傷難犬甚至將責共人不應於戰爭之際、冒險馳車公路其遭飛機擊傷乃属咎由自取也、</p>
<p>夫人公子今晨抵滬</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、據隨英大使許閣森爵士來滬之汽車夫一人聲稱、日飛機以炸彈與機關槍攻擊吾人汽車時、如取準稍確、則吾人今皆不能生存於世、因當時日飛機距吾人之頭、僅約三十五呎也、大使所乘之汽車、乃山佛萊塞武官駕駛、大使之汽車夫坐於佛氏之側、汽車為大奧斯汀轎車、携有五○一五號首都車照、並三七號外交團特別車照、後隨者為大使署近租用之汽車、載大使之侍者與行李、午後五時、過太倉一路平順、因直通南翔與上海之公路、不易通過兩汽車乃折入距嘉定約五哩距滬約十八哩新築之安定公路、當時覺天空有飛機飛行、忽炸彈數枚、落於兩汽車之四周、日飛機兩架、環繞兩車三匝、卒乃下降至距地四十呎、以機關槍掃射、兩飛機一擲炸彈、幸未命中、開機關槍、彈如雨下、在此危急之際、兩車即止於道中、車中之人皆急躍出、伏於附近小浜中、是時皆未知大使均已中彈、直至飛機飛去、始悉大曉業已受傷、兩機於行暴後數分鐘即飛去但吾人伏於浜中多時、始敢復起、飛機旣去、華兵數人由附近匿處奔來、促速開牢、惟時大使腰際流血不止、乃經舁登樊斯汀汽水、向上海疾馳、而於三小時內到達、日飛機雖以機關槍向車掃射、但僅一彈穿汽水右面開嚴之窗、擊傷大使、車上玻璃無一碎者、車身與另一汽小、亦毫未受損云、大使之汽車夫、為魯人、今晨會被傳至總巡捕房、向訊經過情形、至擊傷大使之機關榆彈、陷於汽東後部、已經檢得、送捕房騐視、</p>

<h3>敵機擲彈燬滅我文化機關</h3>
<p>贛農院及京中大等炸燬　無辜民衆遭難者數百人</p>
<p>［南京］自滬戰發生以來、倭寇一再失利、遂派多數飛機至我各重要都市肆意轟炸、引南京·杭州·南昌·漢口·等處、及京滬杭浙贛各鐵路沿綫、均曾迭次有敵機投彈、而被炸者多為找後方文化機關團體、我各地平民住宅被炸燬者頗多、我民衆被炸死傷者亦衆、惟每次敵機來襲、均被我空軍奮勇迎擊，先後擊落敵機四十餘架之多、敵羞憤之餘、其暴行竟復日甚一日、二十六日敵機六架、飛至南昌轟炸投彈於農學院及鄉村師節、炸燬房屋甚多、聞農學院之圖書儀器、損失頗鉅、又南昌葆靈女校亦被炸燬、幸在暑假、學生多已離校、未受損傷、惟學校附近民房被炸燬甚多、民衆死傷三百餘人、二十六日上午一時至三時許、敵機二十餘架射砲控制嚴密、敵機不敢低飛、遂於數千尺之高空、向京市東南各部人烟稠密之區、亂擲炸彈、及燒夷彈數十枚之多、事後調查被燬者有中央大學實騐中學、計炸毀房屋八十餘間、死傷工人夫役多名、遺族學校及城中省三醫院房屋亦被炸燬、又各街道亦有數處中彈多枚、統計各處炸燬及延燒平民房屋共四五百間、無辜民衆被炸斃焚斃者數百入、幸我政府防護周密、對於延燒之房屋、當時卽由消防隊努力撲滅、傷者送院診治、死者妥為掩埋、倭寇此種暴行、與一二八時燬我上海最大文化機關東方圖書館、商務印書館、及此次炊燬天津南開大學、放火焚燒南開中學等、同為燬滅我中華民族文化之有計晝的殘暴行為、其破壞世界和平猙獰面目、實已暴露無遺、</p>

<h3>美政府重申不放棄遠東權益</h3>
<p>國際條約應嚴格尊重　英美法保持密切聯絡</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國務部長赫爾今日宣稱、彼已正式通知中日兩政府、聲明美國决定保護美國在遠東方面之公私利益、如有損失、中日兩政府應負賠償之責、至淤日本海軍封鎖中國南部海口事、東京反上海方面日當局所發表之聲明、頗有出入、此或係日本試探性質、藉觀各國反響、然後再定進退、至以美根本政策而論、美政府决從大處着想、卽欲强迫各國遵守條約及服從國際公法、而不僅以保護美僑生命財産為限、赫爾今日之聲明、足證美國决不放甲遠東及世界任何部份之利益、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］關於中日兩國戰事、英國對日態度現已趨强硬、此在美國則因輿論對於日本所行政策領激心理日益有增之故、亦已採取與英國相類似之態度、此際白宮與國務院方面雖不願發表任何宣言、致涉揭　好戰態度之嫌、但負責方面則謂、日本若果繼續採取挑釁態度、行將陷於進退維谷之境、至關於中日兩國戰事、美國雖以保護本國僑民生命財產為主、但對於一九二一年以來所簽訂各項條約、尢其是華盛頓九國公約、即保證各國在中國享受同等經濟權利者、亦亟欲令共受人尊重、溯自一九三一年以還、日本會經一再提供保證、當在“滿洲國”境內尊重各國經濟權利、但結果食言而肥、美國工商界人士漸被逐出日軍佔領區域之外、今玆中日兩國戰事結果、或使美國在中國某一部份所保有之利益、蹈“滿洲同”方面之覆轍、此在美國懲前毖後自决不聽任何種情事再度發生也、特美國政府並無羞辱日本政府之意、反之並當竭其能力、協助日本脫離難境、而無損於該國之體面、國務卿赫爾前於七月十六日發表談話時、即會揭示維持和平之各項原則、關於各該項原則、各國連日本在內、均已在大體上加以贊同、惟日本對於其在遠東方面之利益、曾經提出保留、赫爾爰乃於本月二十一日再度發表談話、拒不接受此項保留、並說明國際法所載各項基本原則、應用於全世界各國、斷不能僅適用於某國或某洲、此乃日本所應了解者、美國官塲方面又聲明美國外交政策、現仍以和好與善鄰兩項原則為主、惟各該原則有時被傾向帝國主義之國家所誤解、而認為美國對於國際問題不願過問、此在國務卿赫爾最近數星期內、業已表明美國對於全世界經濟政治復興事業均感關切、决不因“某某國際浪人”不願遵守其所自由簽訂各項條約之故遂即採取“破壞復興事業之政策”也、至以美國海軍力量而論、則據政界人士聲稱已經五年中美國被迫參加軍備競爭、以維護本國國防、今茲海軍力量、已可與世界任何他國並駕齊驅而無遜色云、（中央社二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］關於中日兩國爭端、此間各政治觀察家以為中國或當於國聯行政院下月十日舉行常會時、要求提付討論、屆時法國當採何項態度、目前尚未决定、惟注國現仍相信各大民治國出以共同行動、乃屬刻不容緩之事、因而與英美兩國政府密切保持聯絡、此在法國外交界人士則以為國聯會他日對於捉進和平有所行動時、美國倘能從旁加以贊助、則成功希望最為濃厚、以故國聯會若能向中日兩國鄭重提出交涉、而美國同時亦向各該國提出交涉、則對於中日兩國爭端或爲良好解决方法也、關於日本决定封鎖中國東南海岸事、法國負責方面雖極為關切、但以為此與日本未向中國宣戰一項事實、實相牴觸、則以按之國際法、非於宣戰之後不能對鎖敵方海岸、又况依照現行條約、各國對於中國應維持門戶開放政策封鎖之舉猶屬不合、顧日本當局對於外國船舶業已保證不加留難、因此法政府現尚無意提出正式抗議、加之日本外務省當局頃已邀請主要關係五國（英法美德意）大使舉行會議、預料或當聲明日本决定尊重國際法也、此外關於英駐華大使許閣森爵士被日本飛機擊傷一案、法國官塲人士極表惋惜、以為此或日本空軍人員一時之誤、所望此項重大事件、可使日本翻然變計、而對於英法美三國最近所提上海中立化一項建議、採取較為妥協之態度云、（中央社廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>西報載日封鎖我領海</h3>
<p>中國營業影響有限</p>
<p>字林報云、字林報訪員以日本封鎖中國海面之影響、詢諸中國航業界、據稱、此為日本第三艦隊、决計干涉搗亂妨碍中國海上合法商業之舉動、堆積香港上海兩埠之入口品、因缺乏船隻、遂不能運出、將令入口稅為之减少、而使海關受嚴重之影響、揚子江流域為最大之市塲、亦為最大之出口根源地、封鎖之結果、將令揚子江流域與上海隔斷、中國經營沿海航業之船隻、比較尚少、故所受之影響有限云、</p>

<h3>我軍總攻張華浜殘敵</h3>
<p>已攻克車站敵退集江邊　羅店週圍八里內無敵綜　敵軍襲閘北受意外打擊</p>
<p>（本報特訊）截至今日午二時三十分止、我軍各路綫均無變動、且仍維持相當優勢、敵增援陸軍接防滬東江灣北四川路一帶防地援、昨晚曾全綫向我反攻、我沉着應戰、敵終不能越我陣地、一步、我重砲隊由口口路向敵根據地猛轟、聲震全滬、敵損害奇重、張華浜、蘊藻浜、吳淞一帶、我軍昨晚下總攻令、向包圍殘敵壓迫、敵倉皇應戰、傷亡極衆、敵艦於今晨拂曉起、卽以密集砲火攻擊我陣地、企圖掩謹敵軍突圍而出、我軍鎮靜如山、兀　不動、此路敵早在我重重包園下、失去聯絡、已不足盧、至敵主力隊伍、集合獅子林、小川沙、瀏河沿岸、人　拂曉、又全錢向我羅店附近守軍攻擊、敵機數十架、向我陣地肆行轟炸、我軍俟敵迫近、躍出戰壕衝擊、噞殺聲、敵軍驚惶失措、卽紛紛後退、現我軍仍保持昨日陣綫、以大包圍形勢與敵對峙、目下羅店鎮週　　內、無一敵踪、我士氣百倍、左翼戰事日內當有重要開展、</p>

<h3>日本貿易之破綻與中國之抗戰</h3>
<p>— 時任</p>
<p>日本自華北事變以來，因决計以武力侵華，使軍事費大加擴展，遂懇求財界，與以一致的支持，爰於事變之後，舉行了一次財界人之非常召集？參加者有津矗壽一（日銀）大久保利賢（正金）寶來市松（興銀）石井光雄（勸銀）萬代順四郎（三井銀行）漸下清（三菱銀行）森廣藏（安田銀行）長谷川元（住友銀行）明右照男（第一銀行）加藤敬三郎（鮮銀）山本健次（台銀）等二十餘人，都是財界中的錚錚者。在這次召集裹，自由賀屋藏相解說政府對中國之熊度，然後懇請在座的財界，防止公佔的狂跌與新增稅之支持，當由財界方面答稱同意，在可能範團裹，與政府以方便和援助。</p>
<p>自此次非常召集完成以後，大藏省方面約略地管窺到了財界的意向，於是對於預算之追加，一再增加。據最近之傳說，所謂事件費用，已增至七萬萬元，不得不謂龐大之至·不過此說，因近來中日間電訊之隔閡，尚未證實；但因此次事件而惹起之二次追加預算，則為昭然的事實·其追加金額第一次計一億二百萬圓，第二次計四億一千萬圓，共計五億一千餘萬圓，其財源之支辨，出自增稅·新稅·去年度剩餘金和公債，但以發行新公債之數目為最大之此種預算，皆經衆議院一致可决，唯海陸二省尚不满意於此種數目，認為此數不敷支出，經藏相一再衡折，才勉强應允。所以如果戰事·益發擴大，則預算之再加擴充，是在意中之事。</p>
<p>根據最近國勢調查之所得，日本人口，總計九七六五、四六二八人，故日本人民，因此次事變而負擔之金額，計五元有餘，但此僅為月之間所陡負之巨額，如戰事延長到半年或一年以上，則日本人民之生計，非受重大之威脅不可，同時日本之財政，亦非陷於滅亡不可。不過此種財政之危機，一部分固由於軍事費之擴大，一方面則由於因戰事而影響貿易所致，現在試觀其今年上半年之貿易狀况，然後再管窺其今後之趨向，则我們就可明白日本之政財是陷於如何之危機，同時亦可立證我國之抗戰，如能延長，則必致日本瀕於破滅的境地。</p>
<p>據正確之統計，知日本上年度之貿易額，輸出計十六億二百萬圓，輸入則為二十二億四千三百萬圓，兩相抵擋，則計入超六億四千一百萬餘圓，此種入超數額，較之上期之入超三億一千四百萬圓，增加十分之四，可以說是關東大震災以後的十三年之六億八千三百萬餘，較次的數目，但上三年之大額入超，是由於復興關東的資材之購入所致，是種變態的情形，不能看作正常的現象，所以本年度上期之入超額，可謂日本貿易史上之空前記錄；此種入超的原因，不外有三，即：</p>
<p>㊀財政之膨脹，尤以受國防充實計劃之影響，遂多量購入資材。</p>
<p>㊁由於生產力之擴充，遂致多多購入必要之機械及原料品。</p>
<p>㊂輸入商人預知最近之間，有物價增加運貨增加以及圓匯兌之軟化等，故預先大量購入。</p>
<p>不過上流的入超數額之膨脹，一方面固是入超數量的增加，同時也出於物品價格的暴脮所致，因近年以來，由於革需景氣的關係，各國之物價與原料都相繼暴騰，所以實際上往往有數量减少，而價额却見增加的。</p>
<p>考日本之輸入原料，其增加率最大者則為銅，計增至十分之二十二·六，其次為橡膠·鐵等，此種原料很顯明地與軍需資材有充分之關係，亦即這些原料·多是製造殺人的利器之原料。但其輸出品方面，則以棉布·生絲·機械等款為最多，從增加率方面看來，以機械類為最高，計十分之二六·五，他如紙類之十分之五·五帽子之五·五，為較次的數目；這些商品的輸出對象，以東三省關東州為首，北美與中國亦為輸出商品之最大銷貨塲。</p>
<p>最近因中國對日本全面抗戰之展開，日本之對華貿易受到致死的打擊；在滬戰尚未發生以前，中日雙方之定貨契約，已經相繼毀棄，滬戰以後，則此種契約，更無由續繼·所以二國之貿易，可云歸返到絕交的狀態。如果戰事一再延長，則日本商品等於毀滅了一大暢銷處，而在檢出的額量上，亦非大見萎縮不可。再者日本近年對外之貿易，概見不振。此種現象絕非由於各國從來之抑壓或留難荷印之有策動緩和抑壓政策者），實由近年來之日本商品，因原料運貨等等之增加，失却其特殊的優點｜價廉故在海外市塲，已漸現不振；反觀其輸入品方面，因大抵是軍需的原料，如戰事延長，此等原料之輸入量，當然更見膨賬，則且入超之數額，自然有增無已·所以中國能抗戰到底，則日本之財政，單單在貿易的損失上看來，就有無法轉動的現象，更何况其他軍事費之大量膨脹呢？所以我們為了制日本於死地起見，我們應該咬住牙，和日本作長遠的殊死戰，則日本之潰滅，自在意中之事。</p>

<h3>Our Forces' Overall Situation is Superior, Enemy Counterattacks on All Fronts Have Been Repulsed</h3>
<p>Central Special Envoy Supervises the Battle, Morale is Greatly Boosted. Enemy Planes Dropping Bombs Everywhere, Two Shot Down by Us</p>
<p>The battle situation on all fronts yesterday was as follows: ㊀ In the Luodian to Liuhe area, our army holds a distinct advantage. The enemy forces are surrounded by our heavy forces. Although the enemy has repeatedly tried to break through, they have failed. A high-ranking official is on the front line to command and supervise the battle, and the morale is high. There is great confidence in annihilating the stubborn enemy. ㊁ On the Wusong front, from morning to night yesterday, the enemy relied on fierce artillery fire and aircraft cover in an attempt to continue landing. After our army fought bravely and fiercely, there was no opportunity to take. ㊂ In the Zhanghuabang area, the remaining enemies repeatedly attempted to break through our army's encirclement yesterday, but due to our strict deployment, they ultimately failed. ㊃ Late at night, the enemy plotted a counterattack on our army's positions in the Baoshan Road area. Both sides bombarded each other with heavy artillery. After a fierce battle, the enemy could not withstand it and retreated. ㊄ In the Nanshi area, although enemy planes bombed, it had no impact on our military affairs.</p>
<p>Yesterday (28th) at 8:00 PM, the official war report stated: ㊀ On the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, the Zhalin (between Jinshanwei and Nanhui) sea, there are several enemy ships anchored. On the 26th, more than 30 enemy soldiers were sent to land. Because our garrison pretended not to know, more than 200 enemy soldiers swarmed ashore. While they were still establishing a foothold, our army suddenly swept them with light and heavy machine guns. Except for a few who escaped back, the rest were annihilated. ㊁ The enemy forces in Yuepu have been repelled by our army. ㊂ At 4:00 PM on the 25th, an air battle occurred in the sky over Yuepu. Nine of our planes surrounded four enemy planes. As a result, we shot down one enemy plane. ㊃ The enemy in Luodian has dispersed and retreated. However, traitors and prostitutes dare to fire guns within the restricted area and signal the enemy planes. We are strictly suppressing them. ㊄ In the Zhabei area, there have only been minor skirmishes in recent days. ㊅ The enemy in Chuansha, Shizilin, Wenzaobang, and Zhanghuabang are being surrounded by our concentrated and strong forces, and it will not be difficult to resolve them in the short term.</p>
<p>Confirmed news: The enemy who landed in the Liuhe area has shown signs of collapse after being severely damaged by our army. They are gradually retreating towards the riverbank, and our army is advancing step by step, forming an encirclement. Therefore, the enemy has no power to resist.</p>
<p>In the coastal area of Nanhui, after the enemy forces landed some days ago, they were surrounded and annihilated by our army. They have not dared to invade again. It is now known that several enemy ships and several small boats have been discovered at Dengjia Pier, which belongs to Nanhui County, with the appearance of attempting to land. Our army has been strictly vigilant.</p>
<h3>Last Night Our Army Bombed the Enemy in Hongkou</h3>
<p>Accurate Targets, Heavy Enemy Losses. Intense Artillery Fire on Both Sides in the Jiangwan Area</p>
<p>At around 11:10 last night, our forces in Pudong frequently fired heavy artillery at the enemy ships and forces in order to coordinate the offensive of our army in the Wusong and Hongkou areas, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. At that time, the sound was like thunder, shaking the entire port. In 25 minutes, a total of more than 50 shells were fired. Three enemy ships anchored on the surface of the Huangpu River returned fire, but all failed. At 11:40, the firing gradually subsided.</p>
<p>At 0:15 this morning, the enemy forces along North Sichuan Road to Jiangwan Road suddenly launched a sneak attack on our positions in skirmish lines. At that time, our troops were lying in wait. When the enemy soldiers were densely packed, they swept them with rifles and machine guns. As a result, the enemy's plan failed and they retreated in defeat. After our army pursued, they still guarded the original defense and waited in battle formation.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy at the end of North Sichuan Road and the Jiangwan Road area launched a fierce counterattack against us yesterday evening. Our army calmly responded and densely swept with machine guns. After a fierce battle for more than an hour, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated in defeat. In the evening, our army bombarded the enemy headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road with heavy artillery. The artillery fire was fierce and the targets were accurate. The enemy suffered heavy losses. The sound of artillery gradually subsided after about two hours.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Counterattack at Zhanghuabang Was Thwarted</p>
<p>The intensity of the bloody battles in Zhanghuabang and near Luodian this time is unprecedented since the outbreak of the Shanghai War. According to those who returned from the front, our soldiers did not sleep or eat and bravely fought the enemy for more than two days and nights. The sacrifice was also heroic. However, due to inconvenient transportation and fierce artillery fire, the wounded were lying on the ground, lacking rescue. It is hoped that all sectors of society will pay attention to this and urgently seek rescue, so that the strong men can recover as soon as possible and return to the front line to kill the enemy.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy in the Zhanghuabang area continued to land reinforcements. From the night before to yesterday morning (28th), they counterattacked us several times. They were fiercely and head-on beaten by our army, and the enemy did not succeed.</p>
<p>A part of the enemy in the Zhanghuabang area is still entrenched in the buildings near the station and the two road machinery factories. Under the cover of enemy ships, they have repeatedly attempted to break through our army's encirclement in order to develop their positions. In the end, they failed to achieve their goals due to our army's strict deployment. According to a confirmed report at 2:00 AM this morning, the enemy's actions at the end of Yangshupu and Shanghai University were very busy. Observing their situation, it seemed that they intended to attack the north side of Jungong Road. Our defending troops have paid close attention to it.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Counterattack Our Northern Position</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, enemy planes flew to the North Station at 5:30 PM yesterday to bomb it. Then, at 11:30 last night, the enemy on the North Sichuan Road counterattacked our North Station, which was quite fierce. Our army immediately fought back bravely. After a fierce battle until 0:15 this morning, the enemy could not withstand it and retreated.</p>
<p>Our Army Forms a Large Encirclement</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the focus of the Sino-Japanese War has shifted outward, and the Yangshupu area has become silent. After the central route of our army on this line captured the important stronghold of the enemy's naval training ground on the 17th, it took advantage of the victory to pursue and penetrated deep into the enemy's positions, advancing twice to the Huishan Wharf on East Broadway Road, and attacking in two directions, east and west, so that the front line of the army protruded like a triangle. There is a risk of being attacked by the enemy on the left, right, and front, which is considered a taboo in military terms. For strategic reasons, we retreated the protruding part backward to form a large arc-shaped encirclement and strictly defended it. The situation on North Sichuan Road and Bazihqiao remains the same. Both sides are still facing each other in a strict battle formation.</p>
<p>Two Enemy Planes Shot Down in Wusong</p>
<p>The Central News Agency has just learned from Westerners who arrived in Shanghai on the Lincoln President of the Da Lai Steamship Company that the Lincoln they were traveling on arrived at Songkou yesterday morning. They were waiting for a small steamship specially dispatched by the Tai Lai Company to pick them up to Shanghai, when suddenly twelve Japanese planes were seen taking off in formations from outside the port. After circling once on the surface of the river, they prepared to attack our rear positions in Wusong. They were calmly bombarded by our anti-aircraft guns. Two of the shells hit the mark and hit two enemy planes. One of them crashed immediately. The other was hit in the engine compartment by us. At that time, the plane was still struggling to escape, but it did not fly for long before the fuel tank caught fire and was destroyed. It also fell in the end. It was about 11:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday Morning, Enemy Ships Bombed Pudong</p>
<p>From 6:00 AM yesterday, 16 enemy ships anchored on the Yangshupu River concentrated their artillery fire on our Pudong area because the enemy in Liuhe, Luodian and other places were repeatedly defeated. They intended to contain our military strength. At that time, our artillerymen retaliated and fought each other for a long time. The enemy thought that our strength was insufficient, so they sent a large number of enemy troops to attack □□□ in Pudong at about 9:00 AM, attempting to land. At that time, our garrison calmly lay in wait, pretending to be unprepared. Seeing the enemy landing, all the ambushes came out, and ten thousand guns were fired at the same time, immediately repelling the enemy. At that time, many people drowned, and our army intercepted a large number of military supplies. Seeing that our side was prepared, the enemy dared not invade again. The artillery fire from both sides gradually subsided, and it stopped completely at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Enemy Army Landed to Take Over Defense</p>
<p>According to reports received from relevant parties, enemy reinforcements landed at various docks in the Yangshupu area and transported a large number of weapons and baggage. Because the enemy Marine Corps was severely beaten by us and their morale was depressed, they changed to the army to take over the defense. Last night, there was a fierce skirmish on the Hongkou front to prevent our army from attacking. Now our front line is extremely solid, and the enemy's attempt to counterattack is difficult to unfold.</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Enemy Planes Bomb Wusong</p>
<p>The merchant ship Longshan, flying the flag of convenience, entered Shanghai from Wusong at around 11:00 AM yesterday. When the ship arrived at Songkou, it saw several squadrons of Japanese planes, each squadron consisting of four heavy bombers, flying to Wusong to drop bombs on Paotaiwan and Wusong Station. The rumbling sound resounded through the clouds. The Longshan could not move forward and stopped to avoid the bombing. It is estimated that a total of more than 40 bombs were dropped by Japanese planes, lasting for more than an hour. Each Japanese plane began to fly eastward. The Longshan ship was able to sail from Wusong to Shanghai. According to the crew of the ship, there were only more than ten Japanese ships outside the port of Wusong, and there were also more than ten ships in the Huangpu River. The large transport ships carrying reinforcements to Shanghai were No. 132, No. 150, and No. 160, etc. The troops inside the ships have landed, and the empty ships are still staying at the port of Wusong.</p>
<p>Investigation of Enemy Ships in the Huangpu River Yesterday</p>
<p>The number of enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River suddenly increased yesterday. Most of the enemy ships that had been gathered in Songkou some days ago returned to the Huangpu River yesterday. According to the investigation conducted by reporters at Pukou and Songkou from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM yesterday, only nine enemy ships remained gathered at Songkou yesterday, while the number of enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River increased to 26. The mooring situation is as follows: one cruiser and one destroyer each at the Wusong town Pu surface, one transport ship No. 32 and one transport ship No. 60 at the Wenzaobang, one transport ship No. 150 at the Junpu Bureau Pu surface, two gunboats No. 23 at the Power Plant Pu surface, another gunboat whose name has been painted off, one destroyer at the Gaoqiao Pu surface, two destroyers at the Qiujiang Wharf, one destroyer at the Donggou Pu surface, one destroyer at the Yufeng Yarn Factory Pu surface, one destroyer at the Asia Petroleum Company Pu surface, one gunboat at the Lan Road Pu surface, one destroyer at the Water Plant Pu surface, one destroyer at the New Mitsui Wharf, a total of seven enemy ships from pontoon No. 1 to pontoon No. 9 (including the flagship Izumo still berthed at pontoon No. 2), two destroyers at the Mitsubishi Wharf, totaling 26 ships, plus the nine ships outside Songkou, totaling 35 ships. When reporters inspected the Huangpu River, the situation on both sides of the wharves was very bleak. Except for more than ten enemy soldiers at the Osaka Wharf and a large number of remaining enemy soldiers near Wenzaobang, who were very busy, there was no one else in other places. From time to time, people in the Pudong district were shot to death by enemy soldiers in the Huangpu River, and then their bodies were thrown into the Huangpu River, drifting with the waves. There were a large number of them, and the situation was very tragic. The cruelty and atrocities of the enemy army, and their repeated injuries to our innocent people, are also one of the strong evidences.</p>
<p>The Situation in Pudong is Still Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that more than 50 Japanese plainclothes agents were found in Wufunong, Lujiazui, Pudong. After investigation, the area is extremely quiet, and the rumors are based on misunderstanding. Moreover, our military strength in Pudong is strong, and any plans of the enemy cannot succeed.</p>
<p>The Osaka warehouse of the Nissin Company in Zhangjiabang, Pudong, has been destroyed by two major fires. Because the remaining fire was not extinguished, another warehouse was extended at 3:00 PM yesterday. Because there was no one to manage the warehouse, it burned more and more fiercely, and soon it pierced through the top of the warehouse, with raging flames and black smoke rising into the sky. It burned until dusk before it gradually subsided, but the embers were not extinguished. Also, Mitsubishi Company, which is adjacent to the left, also had a warehouse on fire some days ago, and the loss of goods in the warehouse was quite large.</p>
<p>Our Air Force Launched Two Night Raids</p>
<p>At 11:00 last night, our air force flew to the sky over the Huangpu River to attack enemy ships. The enemy army's anti-aircraft guns were frantically fired in a panic. At about 3:10 this morning, our air force appeared again and hovered in the sky for a long time without leaving. Although the enemy ships' anti-aircraft guns fired like a string of pearls, our planes still calmly circled the high altitude for several weeks and returned safely.</p>
<h3>The Course of Fierce Fighting in Luodian</h3>
<p>More Than 3,000 Enemy Soldiers Were Killed or Wounded. Now Facing Each Other Across the River in Zhenxi</p>
<p>The fierce battle in Luodian in recent days has set an unprecedented record in the Shanghai War. More than two-thirds of the town of Luodian has been baptized by artillery fire, and it is a scorched earth. It is too horrible to look at. The enemy army uses planes and heavy artillery to cover the operation, so it always launches a general attack at dawn, while our army advances at night and takes advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness to launch a full-scale attack. Therefore, the number of enemies who sacrificed in our night attack is countless. In Muchao town and Shenjiaqiao north of Luodian, fierce battles between the two sides have not ended. Our army is in high morale and can deal with ten enemies alone. The enemy army has no fighting spirit and can never succeed just by relying on the precision of its weapons.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy near Shengqiao, Muchaozhen, Chenjiahang, and Liuhe, under the cover of heavy artillery and aircraft, repeatedly launched counterattacks on our army's positions. After our army bravely advanced, they repeatedly advanced and retreated. The enemy suffered huge losses, and our sacrifice was also huge. As of this morning, the two sides were facing each other across a small river about four miles northwest of Luodian. It is also learned that the enemy in Xiaochuansha has installed heavy artillery on land in an attempt to cover the enemy's advance.</p>
<p>Traitors Assist in Abuses and Open the Door to Invite Thieves</p>
<p>This reporter met with many refugees who escaped from Luodian to Shanghai this morning. According to reports, after the enemy army sneaked in and landed in the area, plus the traitorous assistance and opening the door to invite thieves, the people in the whole town had nowhere to escape, and many were brutally killed. After several nights of fierce battles, the city and stores in the whole town have been destroyed by about three-quarters. More than 2,000 people escaped, all of whom walked more than 100 miles day and night before arriving safely in Shanghai. It is now heard that the enemy army has been driven back to the vicinity of the coast by our army, but there are still many refugees living in various places. Efforts have now been started to concentrate them to convenient transportation areas, and then transport them to Shanghai by car.</p>
<p>A Military Officer Talks About the Course of the Fierce Battle</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the reporter met with a military officer who commanded the battle in Luodian yesterday. He was told in detail about the enemy army's sneaking landing. It is said that after a large number of enemy reinforcements arrived in Shanghai, they repeatedly tried to land without success. Finally, at 9:00 AM on the 25th, guided by traitors, they sneaked across the river and landed, with a total of about 4,000 people in a brigade, while our garrison troops were only 2,000 people. We were outnumbered and in a disadvantageous position, but the soldiers resisted very bravely, rushing forward one after another and sticking to their posts to wait for reinforcements. In the end, they suffered heavy losses and retreated at 2:00 PM. At that time, our losses were two-thirds. After about an hour, our reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce attack together. The enemy had not yet established a solid position and was suddenly counterattacked by us. They responded hastily and were also defeated and retreated to Muchaozhen, about eight miles outside the town. In this battle, our army was brave and had no retreat, giving the enemy a heavy blow. It is estimated that about 2,000 enemies were killed or wounded, and we also lost about 800 loyal soldiers. Now the enemy is building fortifications by the small river and sticking to them, and we are also waiting in strict formation. The enemy has been attacking for days with the cover of planes and naval artillery, but has not succeeded.</p>
<p>Enemy Corpses Are Everywhere Outside the Town</p>
<p>Two messengers from the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau rode bicycles to Luodian some days ago to deliver telegrams. According to reports, there were no traces of the enemy in the area near the town of Luodian, only enemy corpses were seen all over the ground outside the town. It is conceivable that the battle there was fierce and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. The two messengers returned along the same route after delivering the telegram. Unexpectedly, they were bombed by enemy planes not far from Luodian, and both were injured. Fortunately, the injuries were still light. They returned to Shanghai that night for medical treatment. The spirit of these two people who risked their lives to serve is admirable.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong, Commander of the Frontal Operations Force, Promoted to Commander-in-Chief</h3>
<p>Another High-Ranking Official Assigned to Command the Coastal Defense Force. Commander Yang Talks About Vowing to Annihilate the Stubborn Enemy</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Yang Hu, the Shanghai Garrison Commander, issued a statement yesterday, saying that Shanghai traitors have been spreading rumors recently, and the general public does not know the truth and is often in a state of unease. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, thanks to our loyal and brave soldiers who have been working together, the enemy has been retreating and has become exhausted. The battle situation has been smooth in recent days. Commander Zhang Wenbo has been promoted to Commander-in-Chief by the Central Government. Commander Zhang is fully responsible for commanding the Shanghai battle. The date of annihilation of the remaining enemies is just around the corner. As for the left wing of our army, another high-ranking official from the Central Government is responsible for commanding it. Victory is in our grasp. It is hoped that all the people of our city will be calm and steady, not arrogant or discouraged, and do not easily believe the rumors spread by traitors. This is very important.</p>
<p>A battlefield reporter from the Central News Agency went to visit General Zhang Zhizhong at the ×× Army Headquarters at 9:00 PM yesterday. At that time, General Zhang was commanding the troops to fight, and he was extremely busy, but his spirit was very high. The reporter asked about the recent battle situation on the front line, and Zhang replied with a smile, saying, "I was ordered to command the frontal operations force in Shanghai, and recently I was honored to be the Commander-in-Chief of ×××××. Although I think that my talent and strength are weak, at this time of national survival, as a soldier, I can only swear to die and serve the country, rushing to the battlefield, and making killing the enemy and achieving results my only task. The current war is only the beginning of a full-scale battle. In the future, the arduous struggle will depend on the continuous sacrifice of our loyal and brave soldiers and the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country. I am fighting day and night for the mission I have undertaken, and I dare not slack off. Although the enemy is still rampant, the Central Government has made thorough preparations early. No matter what, they will not succeed in the end. I hope the press will inform the people of the country that I can be responsible for guaranteeing that the final victory of the war must belong to us." The reporter continued to ask whether the strength of the coastal defense force was sufficient, and Zhang replied in a firm tone, "The coastal defense force has now been assigned a high-ranking official from the Central Government to be responsible for the command. The current strength can definitely repel the enemy, so there is nothing to worry about." The reporter also asked, "It is rumored that our army in the Hongkou area has slightly retreated backward. Is it true?" Zhang replied, "Our army in the Hongkou area has no reason and no fact to retreat backward now. As for the reorganization and deployment of the original front line, it is a common thing in war and cannot be considered a retreat." The reporter saw that Zhang was handling military affairs, his hands were constantly writing, and his ears were constantly on the phone, so he was inconvenient to bother him any further, so he resigned.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Afternoon, Enemy Planes Bombed Nanshi and Enemy Ships Bombed the South Railway Station, an Unprecedented Catastrophe</h3>
<p>The Platform and Overpass Were Destroyed by Bombs. Hundreds of Refugees Waiting for Trains Were Killed or Wounded. Bombs Were Dropped Everywhere in Nanshi.</p>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) At about 2:00 PM yesterday, four enemy planes suddenly flew to the South Railway Station and dropped several bombs, hitting the Chenjiazhai bungalows on Miaochiao Road, destroying more than 100 rooms. They then dropped bombs on the South Station, destroying the entire overpass. The station ticket office was also damaged, and the water pavilion east of the station was also bombed and collapsed, and the water was flowing. Hundreds of refugees waiting for trains there were killed or injured. The exact number has not yet been investigated. Upon hearing the news, the reporter drove to the scene. When the car arrived behind the station, he saw that the station was in a mess, the walls had collapsed, and countless houses of the transport company and civilians in the vicinity had collapsed due to the earthquake. It was a desolate scene. Then, when he arrived in front of the station, he looked at the station from a distance, which was almost a rubble field. All the power lines had also been bombed to the ground. There were still dozens of rickshaws stranded on the street, lying on the side of the road. There were packages and luggage on the cars, and the passengers and rickshaw pullers had been bombed to death and fell to the ground, with missing heads and broken arms, and intestines flowing out. It was too horrible to look at. The wall of the training ground behind the Nanshi Fire Brigade was also bombed and destroyed. An official of the association was seriously injured. Dai Peicheng, a firefighter number 25, was also injured in the face by the bombing. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by an ambulance from the West District. More than 300 injured refugees and residents were sent to the three hospitals of Renji, Baolong, and Guangren by ambulances from the West District, South District, and North District, as well as the Buddhist Ambulance Team, the Red Swastika Society, the Red Cross, and the City Boy Scouts. More than 100 refugees who were bombed to death in the park were transported to Xihu and other places by charity groups and burial teams from Tongren Fuyuantang for burial in batches. By 5:00 PM, the work had not yet been completed. A rescuer from the West District also told the reporter that when they were sending the injured refugees to the hospital for the last time, they were spotted by an enemy plane, which chased them closely in the air. It was not until they chased to Lujiabang that they turned their heads east. Fortunately, the driver drove quickly and was not chased. When the incident happened, the bombed area was on fire, and the fire was extinguished after the fire brigades in the South of Shanghai rushed to the scene and bravely rescued the situation, and did not spread.</p>
<p>Another news: An enemy plane team flew to Nanshi at about 2:00 PM yesterday and dropped bombs and sulfur bombs at Dananmen, Lujiabang, Dadongmen Jiuhua Street, and the South Railway Station one after another, causing a large number of displaced people to suffer calamity, and several places caught fire and burned. When the enemy plane was about to arrive, the defense regiment and the ambulance and fire personnel immediately dispatched all personnel to conduct a detailed investigation of the losses, which is still to be investigated. Yesterday, the refugee train that was originally scheduled to go to Hangzhou was temporarily stopped in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Another news: Yesterday, enemy planes bombed Nanshi and shot with machine guns, killing and injuring many passers-by. After 1:00 PM, a bomb was dropped near Dongjiadu, injuring several passers-by near Wangjia Wharf. Another bomb was dropped. At about 2:00 PM, a bomb was dropped near Haichao Temple, fortunately it did not explode. A bomb was also dropped in Sanminfang, next to Haichao Temple, injuring several people and destroying several houses. At the same time, enemy planes flew to the sky above the South Station and dropped bombs. One bomb was dropped on the open space in the wooden fence east of the station. At this time, it was the Jiangxi Guild Hall sending refugees back to their hometowns by train. There were many people, and passengers were also waiting to buy tickets here. There were numerous deaths and injuries. A burning bomb was dropped on the shops and houses in front of the station, and the houses in that area were completely burned down. Enemy planes also dropped several bombs around Gaochang Temple yesterday. The houses from the wharf by the river to the Bansongyuan Road tram station and near Chenjiaqiao were mostly damaged. Miaochiao Road, behind the South District Fire Brigade, was bombed by enemy planes and caught fire, burning for two hours, destroying more than 100 rooms. Except for the South Station, this place suffered the most.</p>
<p>After the enemy planes carried out the bombing, our authorities immediately stepped up vigilance to prevent disturbances, notified the citizens to deal with the situation calmly, and announced martial law earlier at 5:00 PM, cutting off traffic. At the same time, the French Concession authorities temporarily opened and closed the iron gates at Old North Gate Street, Nanyang Bridge, Kangti Road, and Xinyiqiao Road to maintain order in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Persevere in Resistance, Without Worry or Fear</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Since the enemy forces have suffered repeated setbacks in Hongkou and Yangshupu districts, they have had to change their strategy and carry out wanton aggression along the Yangtze River. Some people, seeing the shift in the focus of the war, have suddenly developed a sense of worry and fear. This psychological wavering is partly due to the enemy's use of Chinese traitors to create rumors and confuse the public. On the other hand, it is also because part of the enemy forces have indeed landed in Wusong and Liuhe, once reaching Luodian, and our army's front lines in Jiangwan and Zhabei have also replaced the original offensive with a defensive posture. In addition, the enemy's indiscriminate bombing and the enemy fleet's blockade of the coast have also caused anxiety among some people. However, in this critical period at the beginning of the war of resistance, we must point out that this kind of psychological wavering is absolutely unacceptable. Only by persevering in the war of resistance can we achieve ultimate victory.</p>
<p>Regarding the enemy's strategic changes and the repositioning of our positions, we must first of all know that our country has never had strong coastal defenses. It is inherently difficult to prevent the enemy from landing on a long coastline. The soil along the coast of Wusong, Baoshan, and Liuhe is loose and damp, and it is not suitable for building defensive fortifications. Therefore, our retreat of one or two li is not something to be worried about. And because of the changes in the rear positions, it is natural that the Jiangwan and Zhabei front lines cannot but change from offensive to defensive.</p>
<p>However, in this war of resistance, we must carefully adhere to one principle: that this war of resistance against Japan must be a comprehensive war and must be a protracted war. Only such a war can ultimately defeat the enemy. The enemy's indiscriminate aerial bombing and announcement of a coastal blockade are intended to shake our will to fight at the beginning of our resistance, so that a comprehensive and protracted war cannot be realized. However, in reality, since our country has few bustling industrial cities and no overseas investments, we do not need to have any concerns about this kind of aerial and maritime threat from the enemy, except to prepare for the inevitable sacrifices of life and property.</p>
<p>At present, the most urgent thing for us is to firm up our will to resist and resist the enemy's violent threats. In the January 28th Incident, we fought with the enemy for more than fifty days in the small area of ​​Songhu. Now that we have gone through more than five years of preparation, can we be inferior to that time? We should also know that the war in North China is at least as important in nature as the war in Songhu. And the large-scale resistance on the Jinpu and Pinghan lines has not yet fully unfolded, allowing the enemy to concentrate its forces, threatening Shanghai on the one hand and pressing on Nankou on the other. Therefore, at present, we must not allow a small part of the changes in positions or strategies to cause any worry, but should promote a comprehensive war of resistance with the firmest determination and launch a protracted war of resistance, so that the fierce and barbaric enemy will be driven to final collapse.</p>
<p>Incident of British Ambassador Being Attacked</p>
<h3>British Government Decides to Lodge Strong Protest with Japan</h3>
<p>Reportedly of an Aide-Mémoire Nature; British Counselor Comes to China to Assume the Duties of Ambassador</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the injury of British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, in an attack by Japanese aircraft, it is reported that officials have stated that Foreign Secretary Eden has had multiple telephone conversations with Prime Minister Chamberlain, who is currently on vacation in Balmoral. It has been decided that the British government will lodge the strongest protest with the Japanese government. The contents of the protest will be announced tomorrow or on Monday. It is said that this negotiation by the British government is of a more serious nature than a normal formal protest. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>[London] Britain today demanded from Japan "full satisfaction" for the wounding of British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, by Japanese aircraft. This demand, in the nature of an aide-mémoire, was instructed to be presented to the Japanese government by the British Chargé d'Affaires in Japan. According to reliable information obtained by the Associated Press, this demand forces Japan to choose between "losing face" or incurring the anger of Britain. If Japan rejects this demand, it would be an insult to the personal dignity of King George VI. When this demand will be made in Tokyo has not yet been confirmed here. (National Telegram from the 27th)</p>
<p>[London] Mr. Hall, Counselor of the British Embassy in China, has recently departed by plane for China, in order to take charge of the affairs of the British Embassy during the period when Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen's injuries have not yet healed. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>[London] British newspapers predict that the wording of the protest that the British government will lodge with Tokyo regarding the injury of Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen will be very strong, and may demand compensation. The Times stated that the final detailed report from Shanghai regarding this unfortunate incident has not yet arrived, and should arrive here approximately today, after which the British government will instruct its Chargé d'Affaires in Japan to negotiate with the Japanese government. The Times diplomatic correspondent said that if the Japanese side's explanations do not alleviate British indignation, they will only increase British anger at this atrocity. The Japanese army's statement that it learned that senior Chinese military officers were scheduled to travel on the Shanghai-Nanjing highway on that day is tantamount to saying, "We did not want to shoot the British Ambassador, but we plotted to assassinate the head of a neighboring country with whom we have not broken off diplomatic relations." As for the claim that Chinese people were misusing the British flag, it is also not worth taking seriously. In any case, the Japanese side never had any reason to bomb a foreign car simply because of the actions of some Chinese people that the Japanese side did not like. As for the claim that the Japanese fleet is blockading the Chinese coast, this matter remains to be confirmed. The order transmitted by the fleet commander seems to be inconsistent with the statement issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry that foreign ships would not be disturbed. In any case, there is a crisis lurking everywhere, and it is highly questionable what right Japan has to blockade the coast of a country against which it has not formally declared war.

<h3>British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen's Condition is Improving</h3>
<p>Hong En Hospital Issued a Report Last Night; North China Daily News Denounces False Japanese Propaganda</p>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) British Ambassador to China, Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, was shot by Japanese aircraft with machine guns while traveling by car from Nanjing to Shanghai on the 26th and was admitted to Hong En Hospital for treatment. People in China and abroad are paying close attention to the ambassador's condition. This morning, a reporter from this newspaper visited Hong En Hospital. According to the English doctor at the hospital, the British ambassador's condition was very good last night and he had several hours of restful sleep. This morning, his condition remains good and there should be no special changes in the short term.</p>
<p>According to the hospital's first announcement of the ambassador's condition at 8:00 AM yesterday, the ambassador had a good night (27th) and was able to sleep peacefully. This morning (28th), his general condition is quite good. Subsequently, at 6:00 PM in the evening, the second announcement was issued, stating that the ambassador's condition was even better today (28th) and that there were signs of improvement in all aspects. People across the country are pleased to hear that the British ambassador's condition is improving day by day.</p>
<p>This time, British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was shot by Japanese aircraft with machine guns while traveling from Nanjing to Shanghai. The Japanese cannot deny this, as proven by the staff of the embassy. Therefore, the spokesperson of the Japanese government in Tokyo and the Japanese authorities in Shanghai both apologized to the British authorities. However, according to a report in the North China Daily News, the announcers of the Tokyo J.V.J. and J.K.J. radio stations broadcast in English at 9:00 PM on August 26, claiming that the British ambassador was shot by violent Chinese soldiers. The North China Daily News, in the interest of fairness, revealed this deception and published a short commentary to criticize it, hoping that the Japanese authorities in Tokyo would take steps to correct this distortion of the facts. It also said that according to telegraphic reports, although the Japanese authorities have formally apologized for the attack on the British ambassador's car, the Japanese public may not yet know the true facts, and the news broadcast in English must have been translated from the information in Japanese that the Japanese authorities used to inform their citizens. If so, then it seems that the Japanese authorities should reconsider their attitude of undermining international etiquette. From this incident, we can see that if the bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft this time had not missed Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen's car, otherwise everyone would have died tragically, and there would have been no witnesses. The Japanese authorities would have definitely claimed that it was done by Chinese aircraft, and China would have been unable to defend itself even with a hundred mouths. Furthermore, yesterday's North China Daily News also published an editorial entitled "Blind Foolishness," commenting on the Japanese aircraft's attack on Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen's car, and refuting the Japanese authorities' defense of the aircraft layer by layer. However, the wording was mild and far less indignant than the previous commentary on the bombing of the Great World. But there is one sentence in it that is worth noting: "If the occupant of the attacked car had been of lesser importance, then the promptness and speed with which the Japanese authorities issued their apology would probably have been much delayed." Therefore, if the occupant of the car had been an ordinary foreigner, the Japanese authorities would not only not apologize, but would probably ignore it, treating it as an insignificant incident, or even blaming the person for risking driving on the highway during the war, and that being shot by the plane was his own fault.</p>
<p>The Ambassador's Wife and Son Arrived in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the injury of British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen is of great concern to all parties. The Ambassador's wife and son accompanied the Ambassador to Beidaihe for summer vacation a month ago, intending to return south with the Ambassador after the autumn coolness. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the Ambassador has been traveling south to seek peace, and his wife and son have not accompanied him. After the unfortunate incident occurred, the British Consulate in Shanghai telegraphed them to return south that night. After receiving the telegram, the Ambassador's wife took a specially prepared plane the day before yesterday to a certain place, and then arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. At about 8:00 AM, she went to Hong En Hospital to visit her husband. As of yesterday morning, Mr. Hugessen's condition had not changed. According to doctors, it has now been more than thirty-six hours and there should be no more danger, but because he is weak, the operation has not yet been performed and the bullet has not been removed. The hospital's announcement yesterday morning is recorded as follows: "The Ambassador had a good night last night and slept very comfortably. His condition is even better this morning."</p>
<p>American Sailor Donates Blood</p>
<p>Central News Agency, London, Havas dispatch from the 28th. After British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was injured by Japanese aircraft, he was given a blood transfusion at Hong En Hospital in Shanghai. The blood donor was an American sailor. Officials say that the life of the British Ambassador was saved by the blood of an American, which is very grateful. Furthermore, this further proves the close relationship between Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Madam Chiang Kai-shek Sent a Letter of Condolence</p>
<p>Since the British Ambassador was injured and admitted to Hong En Hospital for treatment, our officials and civilians have all expressed their concern. Chairman Lin of the National Government, Chairman Chiang, Foreign Minister Wang, Mayor Yu, Zhang Zhizhong, Commander of the Jinghu Garrison, Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Martial Law Command, and others have all sent personnel or gone in person to the hospital to express their condolences to the Ambassador. Madam Chiang Kai-shek, the wife of Chairman Chiang, also personally wrote a letter to Madam Knatchbull-Hugessen the day before yesterday to express her condolences. The letter was handed over to Yu Ming of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday morning. Director Yu then took Madam Chiang's letter to Hong En Hospital this morning to deliver it to the British Ambassador.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency said that the Citizens' Union of the First Special District of Shanghai City sent a letter to the British Consul General yesterday morning on behalf of the million citizens of the First Special District to express their condolences to British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. The original letter stated, "Your Excellency, Consul General, this time, due to the Japanese military's atrocities, indiscriminate bombing, and machine gun fire, Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was injured, and the world is indignant, and this association is especially deeply concerned. I am sending this letter on behalf of the million citizens of the entire district to express our sincere condolences to the Ambassador. Please forward this message, and wish the Ambassador a speedy recovery to health. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Union."</p>
<p>Zhang Ming, the former special envoy of Nepal who was awarded a medal, came to Shanghai to express his condolences to British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. In addition, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession and the Employment Training Class for Graduates with Patents or Higher also sent letters of condolence yesterday.</p>
<p>The Driver Recounts the Truth of the Bombing</p>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, a driver who accompanied British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen to Shanghai stated, "If the Japanese aircraft had been more accurate in their bombing and machine gun attack on our car, none of us would be alive today, because at that time the Japanese aircraft was only about thirty-five feet above our heads." The ambassador's car was driven by Military Attaché San Fulese. The ambassador's driver was sitting next to Mr. Fuller. The car was a large Austin sedan with Capital license plate number 5015 and Special Diplomatic Corps license plate number 37. Following behind was a car recently rented by the embassy, carrying the ambassador's attendant and luggage. At 5:00 PM, the journey was smooth through Taicang, because the highway directly to Nanxiang and Shanghai was not easy to pass. The two cars turned into the newly built An Ding Highway, about 5 miles from Jiading and about 18 miles from Shanghai. At that time, we noticed an airplane flying in the sky, and suddenly several bombs fell around the two cars. Two Japanese aircraft circled the two cars three times, and finally descended to 40 feet above the ground and fired machine guns. The two aircraft dropped bombs, but fortunately none hit. The machine gun fire rained down like bullets. In this critical situation, the two cars stopped in the road, and everyone in the cars jumped out and lay down in a nearby small ditch. At that time, we did not know that the ambassador had been hit until the plane flew away, when we realized that the Ambassador had been injured. The two aircraft flew away a few minutes after the attack, but we lay in the ditch for a long time before daring to get up. When the planes left, several Chinese soldiers ran from a nearby hiding place and urged us to open the car. However, at that time, the Ambassador's waist was bleeding non-stop, so he was carried onto a Fen Si Ting soda water car and rushed to Shanghai, arriving within three hours. Although the Japanese aircraft fired machine guns at the car, only one bullet pierced the right rear window of the soda car and hit the Ambassador. None of the glass in the car was broken, and the car body and the other small car were not damaged at all. The Ambassador's driver, a native of Shandong, was summoned to the General Police Station this morning to be questioned about the incident. As for the machine gun bullet that hit the Ambassador, it was found in the rear of the car and has been collected and sent to the police station for inspection.</p>

<h3>The Four Banks' Inland Lending Committee Announces Lending Measures</h3>

<p>[Nanjing] Since the outbreak of the war of Japanese aggression against our country, the Ministry of Finance has taken various measures in response, considering that finance is the lifeblood of the nation. In order to clarify the true picture of various measures to the public, the reporter visited the ministry. The spokesman of the Ministry of Finance said that since the Lugouqiao Incident, the Shanghai market has been quite tense. At that time, the ministry negotiated with the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks to form a Discount Committee to maintain stability. People's hearts gradually turned stable. When the Shanghai War broke out, the ministry announced seven measures to stabilize national finance during the emergency period in order to control the outflow of funds and secure the national financial system. Since the implementation, the matter of capital flight has immediately subsided, and the market has become more stable. The Shanghai Banking Association, considering that Shanghai is the financial hub of the country and that industries and commerce in various places all rely on Shanghai for adjustment, proposed four additional measures to facilitate the circulation of goods, with the aim of making the market more stable. The ministry approved and implemented them accordingly. However, in order to maintain financial integrity and safeguard legitimate business, it ordered that the joint reserve fund and clearing house established by the two associations be effectively managed by the Central, China, and Communications Banks entrusted by the ministry to prevent corruption. This was immediately implemented. However, the agricultural, mining, industrial, and commercial sectors in the interior still need to maintain the circulation of funds in order to maintain enterprises and secure resources. Since the Shanghai remittance plan cannot be promoted in the interior, and the situations in various places are different, in order to stabilize the overall financial system and maintain markets in various places, the ministry again wrote to the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks, asking them to first establish joint offices in important cities with branches, task them with examining local conditions and formulating appropriate measures, and report them for approval and implementation. Later, in order to invigorate the market, increase agricultural, industrial, commercial, and mining production, and meet the needs of the rear areas, it wired the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks again, asking them to establish joint lending committees in important commercial areas in the interior to handle lending matters. The locations are as follows: (1) Hankou, (2) Chongqing, (3) Nanjing, (4) Nanchang, (5) Guangzhou, (6) Jinan, (7) Zhengzhou, (8) Changsha, (9) Hangzhou, (10) Ningbo, (11) Wuxi, (12) Wuhu. At the same time, the lending measures were approved to be followed. According to the collateral specified in Article 4 of the lending measures, it includes 15 agricultural products, 7 industrial products, 11 mineral products, and bonds issued by the Central Government. For those with local market prices, the mortgage discount is calculated at 85% of the market price. Those without market prices are estimated by the local joint lending committee. Short-term commercial notes and the principal and interest coupons of winning public bonds can also be discounted. Financial institutions can apply for re-mortgages on their original collateral that meets the requirements listed in Article 4 in order to facilitate capital turnover. A detailed interpretation of these measures shows that all agricultural, industrial, commercial, and mining products, as well as short-term notes and central government bonds, can be used to borrow money. The national financial system will be greatly invigorated, which will undoubtedly contribute to coping with the national crisis and increasing resistance.

The recent decision by the army and navy to request an additional 200 million yen in temporary war expenses, coupled with rumors of the government controlling military industries and using public bonds of various companies to forcibly allocate public bonds, has made the market even more anxious. The market prices of various securities have plummeted to an extreme degree. (2) The Japanese Finance Minister will submit a draft law to the Diet soon, calling for the use of public bonds of various companies. Any newly established company with capital exceeding a certain amount must obtain government approval before it can open. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb and Destroy Our Cultural Institutions</h3>
<p>Jiangxi Agricultural College and National Central University are Bombed; Hundreds of Innocent Civilians Perish</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Japanese pirates have repeatedly suffered defeats, so they sent a large number of planes to wantonly bomb our important cities, including Nanjing, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Hankou, and other places, as well as the lines along the Jinghu, Hangzhou-Zhejiang, and Jiangxi Railways. Enemy planes have dropped bombs repeatedly, and those bombed have mostly been our rear cultural institutions and groups. Many civilian residences in various places have been bombed and destroyed, and many of our civilians have been killed and injured. However, each time enemy planes attack, they are bravely intercepted by our air force, which has shot down more than 40 enemy planes one after another. In addition to the shame and anger of the enemy, its atrocities have become increasingly serious. On the 26th, six enemy planes flew to Nanchang and dropped bombs on the Agricultural College and rural normal schools, destroying many houses. It is said that the books and instruments of the Agricultural College suffered heavy losses. Also, the Nanchang Baoling Girls' School was also bombed and destroyed. Fortunately, it was summer vacation and most of the students had left the school, so they were not injured. However, many civilian houses near the school were bombed and destroyed, and more than 300 civilians were killed or injured. From 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM on the morning of the 26th, more than 20 enemy planes used the cover of artillery fire to attack the southeastern densely populated areas of Nanjing, dropping dozens of bombs and incendiary bombs from high altitudes of several thousand feet. After investigation, the destroyed buildings included the experimental middle school of National Central University, with more than 80 houses destroyed, and many workers and laborers killed or injured. The houses of the Veteran's School and the Provincial Third Hospital in the city were also bombed and destroyed. Also, several places on various streets were hit by multiple bombs. According to statistics, a total of four to five hundred civilian houses were destroyed and burned in various places, and hundreds of innocent civilians were killed or burned to death. Fortunately, our government's defenses are comprehensive. The fire brigade worked hard to extinguish the burning houses, and the injured were sent to the hospital for treatment, and the dead were properly buried. These atrocities of the Japanese pirates, like the destruction of the Oriental Library, the largest cultural institution in Shanghai, and the Commercial Press during the January 28th Incident, and the burning of Nankai University in Tianjin and Nankai Middle School this time, are all planned and brutal acts of destroying our Chinese national culture. Their hideous faces of destroying world peace have been completely exposed.</p>

<h3>U.S. Government Reiterates It Will Not Abandon Far East Interests</h3>
<p>International Treaties Should Be Strictly Respected; UK, U.S., and France Maintain Close Contact</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull announced today that he has formally notified the Chinese and Japanese governments, stating that the United States is determined to protect its public and private interests in the Far East, and that the Chinese and Japanese governments shall be held responsible for any losses incurred. As for the Japanese navy's blockade of southern Chinese seaports, the statement issued by the Japanese authorities in Tokyo, as opposed to those in Shanghai, is quite different. This may be a probing tactic by Japan to gauge the reactions of various countries before deciding on its next move. However, in terms of fundamental U.S. policy, the U.S. government is determined to take a broad view, that is, to compel all countries to abide by treaties and adhere to international law, and not just to protect the lives and property of American citizens. Hull's statement today proves that the United States is determined not to abandon its interests in the Far East or any part of the world. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the Sino-Japanese war, the UK's attitude towards Japan has now become more assertive. In the United States, public opinion is increasingly agitated by Japan's policies, and a similar stance to the UK has been adopted. Although the White House and the State Department are unwilling to issue any declarations that might be construed as warmongering, officials say that if Japan continues to adopt a provocative attitude, it will find itself in a difficult position. Although the United States is primarily concerned with protecting the lives and property of its citizens in the Sino-Japanese war, it also urgently wants to ensure that all treaties signed since 1921, especially the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees equal economic rights for all countries in China, are respected. Since 1931, Japan has repeatedly provided assurances that it would respect the economic rights of all countries within "Manchukuo," but the result has been a broken promise. American businesspeople have gradually been driven out of Japanese-occupied areas. Now, the outcome of the Sino-Japanese war may cause the interests held by the United States in certain parts of China to follow the same path as in "Manchukuo." The United States will learn from past mistakes and is determined not to allow any such situation to occur again. However, the U.S. government has no intention of humiliating the Japanese government. On the contrary, it will do its utmost to help Japan escape its predicament without damaging its prestige. When Secretary of State Hull gave a speech on July 16, he outlined various principles for maintaining peace. All countries, including Japan, have broadly agreed to these principles. However, Japan has made reservations regarding its interests in the Far East. Hull reiterated his position on the 21st of this month, refusing to accept this reservation and explaining that the fundamental principles enshrined in international law should apply to all countries in the world and cannot only apply to a particular country or continent. This is what Japan should understand. U.S. officials also stated that U.S. foreign policy is still based on the principles of goodwill and good neighborliness. However, these principles are sometimes misunderstood by countries inclined towards imperialism, who believe that the United States is unwilling to intervene in international affairs. Secretary of State Hull has made it clear in recent weeks that the United States is concerned about the economic and political recovery of the world and will not adopt a "policy of undermining the recovery" simply because "certain international vagrants" are unwilling to abide by the treaties they have freely signed. As for the strength of the U.S. Navy, political figures claim that for the past five years, the United States has been forced to participate in the arms race to maintain its national defense. Now, its naval power is comparable to that of any other country in the world and is in no way inferior. (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, political observers here believe that China may request a discussion at the League of Nations Council's regular meeting on the 10th of next month. What attitude France will take at that time has not yet been decided. However, France still believes that joint action by major democratic countries is urgently needed, and therefore maintains close contact with the British and American governments. French diplomatic circles believe that if the United States can provide assistance when the League of Nations takes action to promote peace in the future, the chances of success will be greatest. Therefore, if the League of Nations can make serious representations to China and Japan, and the United States also makes representations to these countries at the same time, it may be a good solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute. Regarding Japan's decision to blockade China's southeast coast, French officials are extremely concerned, but believe that this contradicts the fact that Japan has not declared war on China. According to international law, enemy coasts cannot be blockaded unless after a declaration of war. Moreover, according to existing treaties, all countries should maintain an open-door policy in China, and the blockade is still inconsistent with this. However, the Japanese authorities have guaranteed that foreign ships will not be detained, so the French government has no intention of lodging a formal protest at this time. In addition, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has recently invited the ambassadors of the five major countries concerned (UK, France, U.S., Germany, and Italy) to a meeting, and it is expected that Japan will declare its decision to respect international law. In addition, French officials deeply regret the incident in which British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was injured by Japanese aircraft, believing that this may have been a temporary mistake by Japanese air force personnel. It is hoped that this major incident will cause Japan to change its mind and adopt a more compromising attitude towards the recent proposal by the UK, France, and the United States to neutralize Shanghai.

<h3>American People Petition Government</h3>
<p>Stop Standing By and Watch Japanese Military Invade China</p>
<p>[Washington] The American League Against War and Fascism today wrote to Secretary of State Hull, urging the U.S. government to immediately invoke the Nine-Power Treaty and change America's policy of observation regarding the Japanese military's invasion of China. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>The Refugee Repatriation Committee, jointly formed by the Public Concession's Municipal Council, the French Concession's Conseil d'Administration, the Shanghai International Relief Committee, and the Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, and China Merchants Steam Navigation companies, was officially established yesterday. Representatives from the various bureaus and associations serve as members. It was decided that the repatriation of refugees would begin immediately. However, due to the difficulties caused by the enemy's declaration of a blockade of our seaports, it was decided to send a committee member, Jones, to contact various foreign shipping companies. At the same time, efforts are being made to carry out repatriation by train and inland river launches.</p>
<h3>Enemy Destroys Telegraph Submarine Cables</h3>
<p>Three Companies' Submarine Telegraph Lines Severed from Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The submarine cables of the Great Northern, Eastern Extension, and Pacific companies were destroyed by the Japanese at Wusongkou at 4 p.m. yesterday, disrupting telegraph communications.</p>
<h3>Western Newspaper Reports Japanese Blockade of Our Territorial Waters</h3>
<p>Limited Impact on Chinese Business</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that, according to the Chinese shipping industry, the Japanese blockade of Chinese waters is an action by the Japanese Third Fleet intended to interfere with and disrupt legitimate Chinese maritime commerce. Imports piled up in Hong Kong and Shanghai due to a lack of ships, which will reduce import taxes and seriously affect customs revenue. The Yangtze River basin, the largest market and the largest source of exports, will be cut off from Shanghai as a result of the blockade. Chinese-operated coastal shipping vessels are relatively few in number, so the impact is limited.</p>
<h3>Brief Report on Rear Area Work</h3>
<p>Rescue and Relief</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society rescue team departed at 3:50 a.m. yesterday for Lianyi Villa, Dachangzhen, and other places to rescue seven injured soldiers and police officers, who were sent to the Society's Third Hospital. In the afternoon, when the South Railway Station was bombed, the team immediately took stretchers and went to rescue sixteen injured civilians, who were sent to the First Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>According to reports, the World Red Swastika Society learned that fierce fighting had been taking place in the area near Zhang Huarong's grocery store for several days. Our loyal and brave soldiers are fighting bravely against the enemy, but all the wounded soldiers lack medical care. Upon hearing this, the Society immediately dispatched a company from Shanghai yesterday afternoon to provide medical assistance, and set up the Third Wounded Soldiers' Hospital in a certain location, with Weng Zhilong serving as the physician in charge of everything, so that our loyal and brave soldiers can recover soon.</p>
<p>The Wujiang Shanghai Native Place Association sent off the fourth batch of more than 100 refugee compatriots the day before yesterday, and yesterday continued to send off the fifth batch, also numbering over 100 people. They were all transported by the Municipal Relief Association to Suzhou, and then transferred to boats back to their original homes.</p>
<p>Repatriation</p>
<p>The Municipal Relief Committee has repatriated over 20,000 refugees back to their hometowns. There are still hundreds of thousands of people waiting to be repatriated. In addition to consulting with transportation agencies and shipping authorities to transport as many as possible, and in view of the fact that the Japanese have recently disregarded humanitarianism and sent aircraft to bomb our refugee transport vehicles and strafe them with machine guns, the committee is currently consulting on concrete measures to ensure the safety of refugee repatriation, so that all refugees can safely return to their hometowns. In addition, the reception group of the committee, together with the repatriation group, sent over 1,000 refugees to Suzhou, and ordered each reception center to clear out a portion of its space in order to continue to accommodate refugees along the roads. The repatriation group has also suspended repatriation for two days so that the reception group can complete the investigation of the refugees' native places and then allocate them for repatriation.</p>
<p>The Donghai Vocational School Service Corps is providing relief to refugees. The corps has recently cooperated with the Cixi Shanghai Native Place Association to send Zhejiang refugees back to Hangzhou by several large buses every day. Zhejiang refugees who wish to return to their hometowns can register at the Cixi Native Place Association at Xiexing Building, 3rd Ma Road. A subsidised gasoline fee of five yuan is charged per person.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, upon receiving instructions from the Ministry of Communications regarding inland river transportation during the war, has ordered the joint organization of various groups in the city to coordinate matters. After receiving the order, the bureau established the Shanghai Municipal Inland River Ship Management Committee yesterday, and started with the repatriation of refugees. Yesterday, it specially dispatched three launches, Xie Su, Li Ning, and Li Shun, each towing twelve civilian boats, carrying 3,000 refugees from the Municipal Education Relief Association to Suzhou for dispersal. Today, it will continue to dispatch the Xin Yong'an and Yongping launches to continue repatriating refugees.</p>
<p>The Cixi Shanghai Native Place Association transports Shanghai compatriots back to Hangzhou by many large buses every day. The special bus that departed at 10 a.m. on the 26th safely returned to Shanghai on the 28th. The special bus that departed at 11 a.m. yesterday safely arrived in Hangzhou at 6:30 p.m. last night. Those who wish to return to their hometowns can register at the association's office. A subsidised gasoline fee of five yuan is charged per person.</p>
<p>The Wuxi Jiangyin Shanghai Native Place Joint Relief Association has established five refugee reception centers. The ninth batch of refugees, totaling 800 people, boarded five civilian boats led by Sun Shoubao the day before yesterday to return to Wuxi. Yesterday (August 28th), the tenth batch of 700 refugees boarded six civilian boats led by Yuan Bingrong and others to return to Wuxi.</p>
<p>The Yixing Shanghai Native Place Association is currently handling the registration of Yixing refugees at 128 Shanxi Road. The first batch of 500 to 600 refugees has already been repatriated to their hometowns. The date of the second batch of repatriation can be determined in about two or three days. If there are Yixing refugees in the reception centers who have not yet registered, they can go to that place to request registration.</p>
<p>Donations</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Mrs. Mayor Yu has been working tirelessly for national salvation, donating over 8,000 yuan to the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Women's Association for Comforting Self-Defense and Resistance Soldiers for rescue and relief purposes. On August 27th, Mrs. Yu also donated a gold tripod, a silver tripod, a silver shield, a silver teapot, and a silver airplane globe to the association for use in supporting the resistance against the enemy. On August 28th, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Women's Association for Comforting Self-Defense and Resistance Soldiers received two silver shields donated by Huang Furu, and two reams of white paper from the Cuihua Card Factory.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Institute of Certified Public Accountants yesterday resolved at a council meeting to subscribe to 5,000 yuan of national salvation bonds from the institute's building fund, and sent letters to all 300+ members to do their best to subscribe or raise funds.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Association, in order to assist the government in enriching its national power and benefiting military planning for resistance against the enemy, decided through consultation by responsible persons to focus its efforts on subscribing to national salvation bonds for the government. The association has already purchased 2,000 yuan as a first step, and the large-scale fund-raising method has been planned by the responsible persons of the association, Huang Zaoxiong, Zhou Feicheng, Ma Yixian, etc. As soon as the schools start, they will universally solicit donations from the principals of large, medium, and small schools, as well as all teachers and staff, and parents of students.</p>
<p>In addition to the Shanghai Bar Association subscribing to 5,000 yuan of national salvation bonds in the name of the association, all 48 executive and supervisory committee members will each be responsible for soliciting at least 500 yuan of national salvation bonds, the more the better.

<h3>Reasons for Delayed Departure of Passenger Trains on Two Lines Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>After the railway bureau actively sought solutions, railway traffic is now operating three round trips daily from Shanghai to both Beijing and Hangzhou. Other trains in the Jing Su Kunxi area also operate one round trip each. Many people have been travelling from Shanghai to the inland areas in recent days, and all trains originate from the West Station (Fanhuangdu). The trains yesterday afternoon were delayed due to damage to the tracks and only departed in the evening. All passenger tickets were previously purchased through the China Travel Service, but from today onwards, they will be sold entirely at the station.</p>
<h3>International Relief Committee Rescues Refugees in War Zone</h3>
<p>According to reports from various sources, the International Relief Committee learned that there are many refugees in the war zone who have been brutally murdered by the Japanese, which is unbearable to hear, and they are in urgent need of rescue. The committee immediately consulted with the Chinese and Japanese military authorities and obtained their consent. This morning, a large number of vehicles were dispatched in multiple directions to rescue more than 500 refugees in the areas of Jiangwan Road, Dalianwan Road, Beikai'er Road, Jingzhou Road, Kunming Road, Luoshan Road, and Taopeng Road. The association transported them separately to the reception centers at Masinan Road, West Adams Road, and Bailinan Road for food.

<h3>Foreign Nationals Continue to Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>300 Dutch Nationals Scheduled to Depart; 100 American Nationals Left Yesterday</p>
<p>Due to the war situation, Dutch nationals in Shanghai are going through withdrawal procedures with the Dutch Consulate in Shanghai and are scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 21st aboard the Java Shipping Company's Chichaluya. Dutch Acting Consul General Gaximen held a notice urging Dutch nationals to go to purchase tickets as soon as possible. Those who cannot afford the fare can go to the consulate to receive treatment. It is reported that more than 300 people have already registered with the consulate.</p>
<p>At 10 a.m. today (August 28th), another group of about 100 American women and children living in Shanghai took small launches from the New Customs Wharf to Wusongkou, and then transferred to the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Lincoln to go to Hong Kong and then to Manila.</p>
<h3>Murder for 200 Yuan Claimed Three Lives</h3>
<p>Wang Peixin and Two Apprentices Were Killed for the Same Reason</p>
<p>The woodworking shop at 65, Lane 84, North Fujian Road, was opened by Wang Peixin (44 years old) from Pudong. Since the Shanghai war, Wang has been living elsewhere, and ordered old partner Ding Fulin from Pudong, and apprentices Yang Gensheng (20 years old) and Zhang Binggen (28 years old) to stay and guard the shop. On the 25th of this month, someone discovered that Wang had been hacked to death with an axe in the shop, and the 200 yuan in legal tender he had on him was also missing. After investigation by Hua Detective Xiang Wu and others from the Huishi Police Station, it was found that Wang had been killed for money, and Ding was strongly suspected. He was arrested and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. It has now been learned that the two apprentices, Zhang and Yang, who were staying in the shop with Ding, were also murdered. Their bodies have been found, and the cause of death has been confirmed by Dr. Zhang Yan, a forensic doctor from the First Special Court, to be the same as Wang Peixin: death by axe hacking. The bodies have decomposed and are maggot-infested, indicating that they have been killed for several days. Corpse forms were filled out and orders were issued for burial. The perpetrator, for the sake of 200 yuan, did not hesitate to kill three people. The viciousness of his methods is appalling.</p>
<h3>Strange Lights Discovered in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Recently, a strange light has been discovered on the rooftops of Zhabei. It is shaped like a balloon, its color is purple-red, and sometimes green. It is as big as a soccer ball, and is often seen from a distance at high altitudes every night. When this strange light is discovered at closer distances, a faint sound can be heard, and it rises above the rooftops, about two or three zhang high. It lasts for about ten minutes before extinguishing. Those who see it are amazed.</p>
<h3>Residents of Various Lanes Should Quickly Form Residents' United Associations</h3>
<p>The Guidance Committee of the Lane United Association of the First Special District of this city yesterday issued a notice to the residents of various lanes in the district, as follows: We have received a joint letter from the Shanghai Special City Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating that Wang Manyun, Shen Tianxin, Zhang Yichen, Cao Zhigong, Zhu Yangwu, He Wuliang, Zhou Xuexiang, Jin Guangmei, and eight others have been appointed as members of the Guidance Committee of the Lane Residents' United Association of the First Special District, with Wang Manyun designated as the director, and Shen Tianxin and Zhang Yichen as the deputy directors, etc. In this time of national crisis, the people should have strong unity and unified steps to rise up and save the country from danger. We urge the residents of each lane in our First Special District to quickly come to the association to fill out an application form, follow the organization charter, and immediately prepare to establish lane residents' united associations to strengthen unity without delay. We hereby announce this. The association has also scheduled a meeting of the entire guidance committee for today.</p>
<h3>First Hunan Ship Carrying Goods Arrives in Shanghai After the War</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, for half a month, all Chinese and foreign shipping companies in Shanghai have telegraphed coastal merchant ships to suspend their voyages to Shanghai. Even foreign mail ships only arrived at Sanjiashui, and all goods bound for Shanghai were diverted to Hong Kong. Yesterday, the British Swire Group's Hunan ship ventured from Hong Kong and Fuzhou to Shanghai, fully loaded with goods from Hong Kong and Fujian. It is currently unloading cargo. This is the first ship to carry goods from other ports to Shanghai after the Shanghai war. The ship is now planning to carry goods purchased by foreign merchants in Shanghai to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that Shanghai merchant ships are gradually starting to operate. The New Beijing, which had been stranded in Wusong for some time, entered the Huangpu River yesterday morning (August 27th) and sailed to Ningbo in the evening with 1,200 refugees. When it returns to Shanghai, it is expected to carry a large number of passengers to Shantou on Monday. Swire Group's Hunan has sailed into the Shanghai port and is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong and Guangzhou tomorrow. The Shengjing is scheduled to depart for Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Yantai on Tuesday. However, Yangtze River shipping is still unable to operate because the Chinese government has implemented a blockade under Zhenjiang.</p>
<h3>Shanghai District Court Retains Few Judges and Prosecutors to Work</h3>
<p>The Rest Are on Leave Without Pay</p>
<p>The daily expenses of the Shanghai District Court are paid from the court's public funds from previous years, which is called "Fa Yu." Because the court is located in a litigation-prone area of Shanghai, the income from litigation fees, fines, etc. is sufficient to maintain it. The court originally had 60,000 yuan in "Fa Yu." 30,000 yuan was reimbursed under the construction of the former President Fu Yuan, and only 30,000 yuan remains. However, there are as many as 40 judges and prosecutors, as well as clerks, recorders, bailiffs, judges, public servants, and the salaries of the custodial center. The meager 30,000 yuan can only last for two months. Now, all the prisoners in the custodial center have been released, and no cases have been accepted from the outside. As for civil litigation, it is feared that none will occur this year. Since the court is not accepting cases, it has no income from litigation fees and cannot maintain itself. Moreover, since there are no cases to handle, these dozens of officials are not needed. Therefore, President Zhou and Chief Du specially convened a court affairs meeting yesterday. All officials above the rank of clerk attended. It is reported that the proposal was to retain three judges and three prosecutors in the court, and six clerks paired with these judges, for a total of twelve people. These twelve people should come to the court every day to work and will still be paid their original salaries. All other officials and bailiffs will be uniformly placed on leave without pay. When the situation is calm, they will be paid retroactively and the matter will be reported to the superiors for record.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Asks Ministry of Industry for Instructions on Factory and Material Relocation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Industry: We received a letter from the Shanghai Electrical Manufacturing Industry Association stating that, according to a letter from the association's member, Gong Ji Battery Factory, the current Shanghai war is unlikely to end in the short term. Regarding the relocation of industrial materials, our factory suggests that your ministry quickly devise a plan to move the main raw materials used in battery production, such as lead sheets, zinc sheets, and sal ammoniac, away from the war zone or to the inland, to avoid depleting resources and to meet urgent production needs. Upon deliberation, we believe that the member's statement is insightful, and many manufacturers in Shanghai share this view. We are therefore forwarding the letter for your consideration. We hope that your ministry will promptly formulate a comprehensive plan for relocating industrial materials to facilitate informing and guiding the industry. Respectfully submitted. After investigation, the relocation of factories and materials to safe areas should involve a comprehensive plan. We recently learned that your ministry has established a committee to study this matter. Based on the foregoing circumstances, we hereby respectfully submit this matter to your ministry for review and approval. We hope that this matter will be discussed and instructed for compliance, which would be in the public interest. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce expresses its gratitude."</p>
<h3>Pawn Industry Asks for Flexible Withdrawals to Stabilize the Economy of the Poor</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating that it had received a letter from the Shanghai Pawnshop Association: "The association's member pawnshops have previously resolved to conduct redemption in safer areas and have separately written to silver firms for the convenience of exchanging subsidiary currency. However, member pawnshops are now reporting that since the Ministry of Finance announced the seven articles of the 'Emergency Financial Stabilization Measures,' pawnshops can only withdraw 5% of their deposits from silver firms each week, with a limit of 150 yuan. In this situation, it is impossible to resume business. With refugees everywhere, the number of pawns is greater than the number of redemptions. Even with each household pawning only a few yuan or cents, it is impossible to offset the pawns with redemptions. It is essential to rely on the special flexibility and normal transactions of silver firms to cope with the situation and ensure sustainability. We are therefore requesting a special presentation to the Ministry of Finance, seeking flexibility for pawnshops within the seven articles to allow the city's common people and refugees to have economic turnover, which would not only benefit the stability of the rear. We propose that, similar to the example of factories issuing wages, the Ministry of Finance should supplement the fifth item of the 'Emergency Financial Stabilization Measures' to enable the pawn industry to have capital turnover and the poor to maintain their livelihoods."</p>
<h3>Yan Tongyin Hall Donates 10,000 Yuan to Relief Refugees</h3>
<p>The refugee camps run by the Joint Charity Relief Association are numerous and in urgent need of funds. Efforts have been made to solicit donations. It is now known that "Yan Tongyin Hall" has generously donated 10,000 yuan in legal tender to the association, designated for the relief of refugees. The association has sent a reply expressing its gratitude after receiving the donation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Opens Cold Storage Facilities</h3>
<p>Commodity Prices Expected to Stabilize</p>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council believes that public security within the Shanghai Concession has become increasingly stable, order has gradually been restored, and transportation is gradually resuming. Therefore, all vegetable markets within the concession have been restored to their pre-war state. However, due to a slight shortage of food, prices in the central market are about 20% to 25% higher than usual. To stabilize market prices, the Shanghai Municipal Council has arranged to remove goods stored in its cold storage facilities on Dixwell Road and Chaoufoong Road for sale in various vegetable markets. The Shanghai Municipal Council is working hard to open other cold storage facilities. Therefore, commodity prices in the vegetable market will soon return to their original state.</p>

<h3>Our Army Launches General Offensive Against Remaining Enemy Troops at Zhanghuabang</h3>
<p>Enemy Station Captured, Enemy Retreats to Riverside / No Enemy Within Eight Li of Luodian / Enemy Attack on Zhabei Suffers Unexpected Blow</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) As of 2:30 PM today, all lines of our army remain unchanged and maintain a considerable advantage. The enemy's reinforcing army took over the defense of the Jiangwan and North Sichuan Road areas in eastern Shanghai. Last night, they launched a full-scale counterattack against us. We calmly responded to the battle. The enemy ultimately could not cross our positions, not even a step. Our heavy artillery units fiercely bombarded the enemy's base from X Road, shaking the entire city of Shanghai. The enemy suffered extraordinarily heavy damage.

The enemy responded in a panic, with numerous casualties. Enemy warships began to attack our positions with concentrated artillery fire from dawn this morning, attempting to cover the enemy's breakout. Our army remained calm and unmoving. The enemy on this route had long been cut off from contact under our heavy encirclement and was no longer a concern. As for the enemy's main force, they gathered along the Lion Grove, Xiaochuansha, and Liuhe coasts. At dawn, they launched a full-scale attack on our defending troops near Luodian. Dozens of enemy aircraft carried out indiscriminate bombing of our positions. Our army waited for the enemy to approach, then leaped out of the trenches to attack, with cries of killing. The enemy troops were panicked and retreated one after another. Our army is currently maintaining yesterday's lines, confronting the enemy in a large encirclement. At present, there is no trace of the enemy within eight li of Luodian Town. Our morale is a hundredfold. Important developments are expected in the left-wing battle within days.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) The remaining enemy troops who landed at Zhangzaobang are in our heavy encirclement, cut off from contact. At 8 PM last night, a general offensive order was issued, and three sides advanced to clear out the remaining enemy troops.

<h3>Cracks in Japanese Trade and China's Resistance</h3>
<p>— Shiren</p>
<p>Since the North China Incident, Japan, determined to invade China by force, has greatly expanded its military expenditures, thus beseeching the financial community for unified support. Therefore, after the incident, an extraordinary gathering of financial figures was held. Participants included Toshitsuku Juichi (Bank of Japan), Okubo Toshikata (Yokohama Specie Bank), Horae Ichimatsu (Industrial Bank of Japan), Ishii Mitsuo (Hypothec Bank of Japan), Mandai Junshiro (Mitsui Bank), Hayashita Kiyoshi (Mitsubishi Bank), Mori Hirozo (Yasuda Bank), Hasegawa Gen (Sumitomo Bank), Ake Uteruo (Dai-ichi Bank), Kato Keizaburo (Bank of Chosen), and Yamamoto Kenji (Bank of Taiwan), among over twenty others, all prominent figures in the financial world. At this gathering, Finance Minister Kaya explained the government's stance on China and then implored the financial community to prevent a sharp fall in public debt and to support new taxes. The financial side responded with agreement, promising to provide convenience and assistance to the government within the possible scope.</p>
<p>Since the completion of this extraordinary gathering, the Ministry of Finance has roughly glimpsed the intentions of the financial community. Consequently, the additional budget has been repeatedly increased. According to recent rumors, the so-called incident expenses have increased to 7 billion yuan, which must be said to be extremely large. However, this claim has not been confirmed due to recent disruptions in telecommunications between China and Japan. Nevertheless, the two supplementary budgets triggered by this incident are a clear fact. The first supplementary budget amounted to 102 million yen, and the second amounted to 410 million yen, totaling 512 million yen. The financial resources for this expenditure came from increased taxes, new taxes, last year's surplus, and public debt. However, the issuance of new public debt accounted for the largest portion. All of these budgets were unanimously approved by the House of Representatives. However, the Army and Navy Ministries were still dissatisfied with these figures, believing that they were insufficient to cover expenses. After repeated negotiations by the Finance Minister, they reluctantly agreed. Therefore, if the war expands further, further expansion of the budget is to be expected.</p>
<p>According to the latest national census, the total population of Japan is 97,654,628. Therefore, the amount burdened by the Japanese people due to this incident is over 5 yuan per person. However, this is only the huge sum suddenly burdened in one month. If the war extends to half a year or more, the livelihood of the Japanese people will inevitably be severely threatened, and Japan's finances will inevitably fall into ruin. However, this financial crisis is partly due to the expansion of military expenditures and partly due to the impact of the war on trade. If we now observe the state of its trade in the first half of this year and then glimpse its future trends, we can understand the crisis in which Japan's politics and finances are trapped. At the same time, we can prove that if China's resistance can be prolonged, it will inevitably lead Japan to the brink of destruction.</p>
<p>According to accurate statistics, Japan's trade volume in the previous year was 1.602 billion yen in exports and 2.243 billion yen in imports. The trade deficit was over 641 million yen. This deficit increased by four-tenths compared to the previous period's deficit of 314 million yen. It can be said to be the second-largest figure since the Great Kanto Earthquake, following the 683 million yen thirteen years ago. However, the large trade deficit three years ago was due to the purchase of materials for the reconstruction of Kanto. This abnormal situation cannot be regarded as a normal phenomenon. Therefore, the trade deficit in the first half of this year can be called an unprecedented record in the history of Japanese trade. The reasons for this trade deficit are no more than three, namely:</p>
<p>(1) The expansion of finance, especially under the influence of the national defense enhancement plan, led to the purchase of a large amount of materials.</p>
<p>(2) Due to the expansion of productive capacity, it led to the purchase of necessary machinery and raw materials.</p>
<p>(3) Importers, knowing that there would be price increases, increased shipping costs, and depreciation of the yen exchange rate, purchased large quantities in advance.</p>
<p>However, the expansion of the trade deficit is partly due to the increase in import volume and partly due to the soaring prices of goods. In recent years, due to the economic boom, the prices of goods and raw materials in various countries have risen successively. Therefore, in reality, there is often a decrease in quantity, but an increase in value.</p>
<p>Examining Japan's imported raw materials, the largest increase rate is for copper, increasing by 22.6%. The next are rubber and iron. These raw materials are clearly closely related to military supplies, that is, these raw materials are mostly raw materials for manufacturing lethal weapons. However, in terms of its exports, cotton cloth, raw silk, and machinery are the most numerous. From the perspective of the increase rate, machinery is the highest, accounting for 26.5%. Other items such as paper (5.5%) and hats (5.5%) are lower. The export targets for these commodities are mainly the Three Eastern Provinces, Kwantung Leased Territory, North America, and China.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the full-scale war of resistance against Japan by China, Japan's trade with China has suffered a fatal blow. Before the outbreak of the Shanghai war, contracts between China and Japan had been successively canceled. After the Shanghai war, these contracts could no longer be continued. Therefore, trade between the two countries can be said to have returned to a state of severance. If the war is prolonged, Japanese commodities will be equivalent to destroying a major sales outlet, and the export volume will inevitably shrink greatly. Furthermore, Japan's foreign trade in recent years has generally been sluggish. This phenomenon is not due to the suppression or hindrance of various countries (except for the deliberate mitigation of suppressive policies in the Dutch East Indies). It is due to the fact that in recent years, Japanese commodities have lost their special advantage – low prices – due to increased raw material and shipping costs, and have gradually become sluggish in overseas markets. Conversely, in terms of its imports, since they are mostly military raw materials, if the war is prolonged, the import volume of these raw materials will naturally expand further, and the trade deficit will naturally increase. Therefore, if China can resist to the end, Japan's finances, simply in terms of trade losses, will have a phenomenon of being unable to turn around, let alone the large expansion of other military expenditures. Therefore, in order to put Japan to death, we should grit our teeth and fight a long-term war of attrition with Japan. Then Japan's collapse will be inevitable.</p>
<h3>Jinpu Front Gradually Enters Major War</h3>
<p>Jinan correspondence, the Japanese army on the Jinpu Line has recently reinforced troops and is actively invading south. Our army defends the country and the land, bravely fighting. The artillery fire near Jinghai is fierce, and gradually entering a major war period. According to reports from the transportation sector, our army and the Japanese army began fierce fighting north of Jinghai on the 21st, which did not stop all night. On the Jinghai side, at 2 am on the 22nd, artillery fire was heard in front, closer than on the 21st. Forty to fifty shells fell near the station's flagpoles. Station employees have temporarily evacuated. By 6 am, the battle became more intense, with both sides firing artillery and machine guns at each other. Enemy shells fell only one li from the station. At 6:25 am, an enemy aircraft flew to Jinghai for reconnaissance and bombed and strafed. Our army returned fire with machine guns, and the Japanese aircraft fled in panic. At that time, our army □□ was stationed in Dongbian Village, five li from the station, defending the area. Suddenly, more than 300 enemy troops attacked the area. The enemy troops also strafed the Jinghai county seat west of the railway from Dongxiazhuang northeast of the railway, so the shells all passed over the station. At 1 pm, enemy troops also invaded the Xuzhuang area. Our army bravely fought back, with fierce artillery fire. Soon, our reinforcements arrived and joined the battle, achieving initial success. A death squad alone charged into Dongxiazhuang. The enemy troops could not withstand it and retreated. At that time, part of the enemy army fell into our battle trench and more than thirty people were beheaded by us, and the rest fled in panic. However, there were still some stubborn remnants of the enemy who refused to retreat. Their artillery fire line was in the east, opposite Jinghai Station. Rifle fire could be heard at the station. Our armored vehicles have all been driven to the front to prepare for a fight with the enemy. At the same time, a certain unit of our Machang garrison also drove to reinforce. By the evening, the battle became even more fierce. It was reported that about 2,000 enemy troops participated in the battle, and a certain unit of our reinforcements also rushed to the scene overnight and engaged in battle at the station. Road employees all boarded armored vehicles to work (22nd).</p>
<h3>Gao Junting Surrenders to Resist the Enemy</h3>

Now Gao Junting, seeing that the Japanese invaders have penetrated deeply, has suddenly realized and surrendered to the director's office, willing to participate in resisting the enemy. Director Wei has agreed to his request.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Air Battle Shoots Down Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>Shops in Sucheng Have Resumed Business and People's Hearts Are Gradually Settling</p>
<p>Suzhou correspondence, on the morning of the 6th, two enemy aircraft attacked Suzhou twice, but were driven away by our air force and did not drop bombs. At 3:25 pm, another 22 enemy aircraft, divided into four teams, flew swiftly from the east. Our air force received the report and immediately took off to meet them. Although they were outnumbered, our air force soldiers were a hundred times braver. In the air over Suzhou, they used machine guns to strafe and opened anti-aircraft guns and rifles to shoot at the enemy aircraft. However, two enemy aircraft were shot down by our air force. Both enemy aircraft were burned on the spot after falling, and both Japanese pilots were killed. The other enemy aircraft fled to the east. The battle lasted about twenty minutes. In this battle, enemy aircraft dropped more than ten bombs. According to news from Wujiang, multiple enemy aircraft came to Pan Chengwei, Nanku Township, and dropped six bombs on the 15th. It is also learned that enemy aircraft dropped three bombs in Wuxi at 7 am on the 16th, causing very little damage.</p>

<h3>Shijiazhuang Captures Traitors</h3>
<p>Accomplices Scattered in Various Places Specialize in Spying on Military Intelligence / Organized Plainclothes Teams Attempting to Take Advantage of the Opportunity to Riot / Baoding Also Arrests Several Important Traitors</p>
<p>Baoding correspondence, since the Lugouqiao Incident, the various important locations north of Zhengzhou on the Pinghan Line have repeatedly cracked plots of traitorous activities, which have been severely punished by local authorities to deter future offenders. As Pingjin fell one after another, Baoding has become the only military and political center on the national defense front line. The Yi Provincial Government has repeatedly issued orders to all its subordinate agencies to jointly maintain the security of the provincial capital, and strictly ordered the joint inspection office of the military police and the Baoding Provincial Capital Garrison Headquarters to ban illegal activities and closely arrest traitors. As a result, multiple cases of traitors have been cracked in Baoding and Shijiazhuang in recent days, among which the case cracked in Shijiazhuang is particularly noteworthy. The reason is that Shijiazhuang was originally an important station on the northern section of the Pinghan Line and the starting point of the Zhengtai Line. With convenient transportation, it has become a commercial center on the border between Hebei and Shanxi, and is also valued by the enemy. The enemy sent traitors to lure unemployed people in the area with heavy money to drive them to do their bidding. After the authorities discovered their conspiracy, they sent a large number of detectives to investigate. The literary editor Li Yiliang (also known as Li Duoshan) of the Shimen Zibao and retired soldier Yang Huamin, who were acting suspiciously, were arrested a few days ago. After interrogation, it was proven that they were indeed serving as enemy agents, colluding to establish a newspaper in Zhengding as a secret agency, and had recruited many accomplices in Baoding and Shimen to organize a plainclothes team. The plan was to riot in the Shijiazhuang area when the enemy attacked Baoding. All these conspiracies have been confessed by them. The Shijiazhuang garrison has sentenced the traitors to death in accordance with the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Against the Republic of China. Yesterday, they were tied up, wearing tall paper hats with their names and crimes written on them, paraded through the streets, and then escorted to the Xihua Garden Theater to be executed by firing squad. After the case was solved, Ye Yuling, director of the Shijiazhuang Police Bureau, continued to intensify the search for their accomplices in order to wipe them out in one fell swoop. Another person, Song Tonglin, 38 years old, from Bin County, Shandong Province, was arrested a few days ago. He was also engaged in illegal activities under the pretext of selling newspapers and was also executed by firing squad. At the same time, in Baoding, two important suspects, Gao Tianzhu and Zhang Jinhui, were arrested. Gao and Zhang claimed to be representatives of the Beijing Reporters Association, who came to Baoding to comfort the wounded soldiers. However, they were found to be carrying a map of the Baoding area with marked symbols and three certificates from the Baoding University Antiterrorist Patriotic Society, but after verification, they were all forged. The authorities are investigating strictly. Judging from the objects they carried and the evasiveness of their words, they are undoubtedly traitors. In addition, the Baoding Police Bureau cracked another case of traitor at a certain place a few days ago. According to the interrogation, there are still three or four accomplices active in Baoding. The authorities have taken strict measures to eliminate the source of trouble.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Changshu After the Outbreak of the Shanghai War</h3>

That night, the Public Service Guidance Institute and the Anti-Enemy Support Association worked all night, and the militias of each district also dispatched in teams to take on their pre-determined tasks. The next morning, faint artillery fire was heard in the urban area, seemingly coming from the Mount Li River area. Enemy aircraft came in groups of three or five to the area, but were often chased away by our aircraft. At the same time, the city was equipped with warning devices. Whenever an enemy aircraft came, it would sound a long whistle, so the community public has become accustomed to it. When the alarm is sounded, they will hide in the house in an orderly manner. Only on the afternoon of the 17th, did three enemy aircraft fly to investigate and dropped three bombs. At 6 pm on the 18th, another thirteen enemy aircraft passed over the sky of the port and dropped four bombs. As for the enemy warships, they often harassed the Jiangbin area and occasionally bombarded Fushan, Hupu, Baimao and Xu Liuqing. All the ports were bombarded, but most of them did not explode. Except that one civilian house was destroyed in Hupu, the rest were unharmed. On the night of the upper five day of this month, the Xu Liuqing port was once tense. That night, there was a storm. Seven enemy warships actually used fierce artillery fire to bombard the shore, intending to take advantage of the storm to carry out a forced landing. At that time, in addition to calmly responding to the battle, our garrison transferred reinforcements from a certain place. The enemy was unable to succeed. The wounded soldier hospitals were also established in three locations, and the arrangements were extremely well.
