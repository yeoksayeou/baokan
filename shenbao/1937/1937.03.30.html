<p>時評</p>
<h3>意南恊定的影響</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>被稱為“巴爾幹樞軸”的南斯拉夫。與其毘鄰意大利。一向幾乎可說是形成㧞劍相向的狀態的。現在忽然杯酒言歡。締結了具有重大意義的政治恊定與經濟恊定。這是墨索里尼外交政策的新勝利。對於歐局所可發生的政治影響。是很值得注意的。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫本為法國在巴爾幹方面最大的衛星。可是過去法國總理兼外長的親意政策。不免使南斯拉夫失望等到德國國社黨在巴爾幹施展了手婉。予南國優厚的經濟利益。南國對德的態度便為之一變。法國人民陣綫登台後。法南關係雖稍改善。但南首相斯多瓦諾維區。卻還－再聲明不願牽入任何歐洲對立的集團。只要一個國家。能夠給南國以經濟的利益。他都願與之親善。可知法國要拉南斯拉夫加入反德集團已不可能了。</p>
<p>再就英南關係來說。南斯拉夫現在的攝政保祿親王。與英國王室有很密切的親誼。前英王愛德華第八去夏巡行巴爾幹各國。也深得巴爾幹各國尤其是南斯拉夫的好感。如果英國外交家繼續在南國積極進行親善外交。也許南斯拉夫不會為意大利所拉攏。可是英國的保守黨人。對於巴爾幹各國的外交。沒有多大注意。而墨索里尼卻把握了這機會不放。拿了橄欖枝。向南國大獻慇懃。同時德國反對匈牙利復辟。其步調也與南國－致。於是南斯拉夫覺得德意兩國並不如其所想像的可畏。再加去年九月間小恊約各國會議。曾有共同的議决。如集體安全不可能。小恊約各國為謀自身的安全起見。可以和其他國家單獨進行可能範圍的恊調政策。南國鑒於英法不能給與安全保障及經濟的利益。也何樂而不接受意大利的靑睞呢。</p>
<p>意南政治和經濟恊定中。南國所獲的利益。其最重要者自為政治恊定中第一項。卽由意國保障南國海陸邊境安全。而意大利所獲得的利益。其最要者。卽南國承認意大利帝國。我們知道。以往南國常常恐怕意大利侵佔其領土。今意大利明白表示。尊重亞得利亞海的共同邊界。南國固然可以滿意。但南國承認意國兼併阿比西尼亞。這對於國聯所主持的集體安全。對於南國舊時同盟國如英法小恊約等。不啻是背盟反汗。兩者相衡。在南斯拉夫恐還是得不償失。不但此也。墨索里尼因有意南恊定的成立。旣足壯外交陣容。雄視巴爾幹及多瑙河各國。又可放手干涉西班牙內戰。無後顧之憂。此後亞得利亞海的波濤。也許可以暫時平息。而地中海的波濤。必將更加洶湧了。</p>
<h3>兒玉抵長崎將報告外務省</h3>

<h3>日印會議告一段落</h3>
<p>現草擬議定書</p>
<p>［東京］外務省曾於二十五日訓令米澤代表、以最後修正之妥恊案為基礎、進行交涉、於是該代表卽於二十七日在德里舉行第十七次日印會商、彼此折衝之結果、印度方面畢竟接受該妥恊案、乃以雙方代表之名義、正式發表、並電告外務省、於是經過九個月時光之日印會商、竟告解決、數日內卽可將恊定文句整理完竣、然後由雙方代表舉行臨時調印、同時公布該恊定案之大網、至於正式調印、大致可於五月中在倫敦華行、茲將此次發表之內容錄於左、日木代表與印度代表於二十七日會見、對於現行議定書之更新各主要絛項、雙方意見巳趨一致、卽由日本可向印度輸入棉布、而與其輸入量相連繫之印度棉花、對於其購買量意見完全一致、又對於應分別品目種類之日本棉布各品種之分配率、及分別品種間之移讓率、其意見亦完全一致、現巳由雙方代表起劃新議定書、一俟完竣、卽當發表其主要各點云云、（二十九日同盟電）</p>

<h3>蘇聯黨部缺點斯丹林之報告</h3>
<p>共黨人員迷於建設成績　忽略資本國對蘇聯陰謀</p>
<p>［莫斯科］蘇聯共黨領袖斯丹林、最近曾於本月三日繕具報告書、呈交共產黨中央執行委員會、痛陳該黨種種缺點、力主現有領袖亟應重加訓練、黨內組織及方針、均有改絃易轍之必要、該報告書復指明托洛斯基派種種破壞工作之成功、以示旣往之過誤、亟應加以改革、黨內領袖職員官吏等、均應恪守列寗主義之成規、庶不致為托派份子所乘云、（中央社廿九日路透電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］本年三月三日蘇聯共黨中委全會中、斯丹林君曾提出報告、評論黨部工作缺點、及淸算托派及其他叛徒之方法、原文現經發表如下、</p>
<p>斯氏首指出基本事實三點、第－、外國密探之破壞•顚覆•及間諜活動、對於吾國全部組織、或幾於全部組織、無論經濟的•或行政的•甚至黨務的多少均有影響、此項活動中、托派分子曾居積極地位、第二、外國密探連托派份子在內、不但曾侵入下層組織、甚至取得某種重要位置、第三、吾黨中央及各省一部份領袖同志、未能覺察此種破壞者•顚覆家•間諜•及暗殺犯之眞面目、反而鎮靜•率直•亳不留心•至如此地步、以致時時親手恊助援引此種外國密探、達於負責地位、</p>
<p>斯氏繼分析造成此種形勢之原因稱、“吾黨同志、因過分熱中於經濟運動及經濟建設前綫之偉大成績、遂忘却布爾雪維克决不能遺忘之某些極重要事實、彼等忘却蘇聯係在資本主義的環境中、此意係謂蘇聯一國雖已建立社會主義制度、此外尚有極多資產階級國家、則仍繼續資本主義生活、彼等包圍蘇聯、等候機會進攻之、摧毀之、至少亦削弱其威力、吾黨同志、竟忘却此基本事業、而此事實正係决定資本主義環境與蘇聯間關係之基礎、斯氏繼指出　各資產階級國家、方互派間諜•破壞者•顚覆者•有時甚至暗殺黨徒•入他國內部、從而問曰、此種資產階級國家對於蘇維埃社會主義國家之態度、豈能較對其同類更為溫和、更為敦睦、從馬克斯主義立場觀之、苟假定各資產階級國家派至蘇聯後方之間談•破壞者•顚覆家•暗殺犯•必較派入其他寶產階級國家後方者更多二倍或三倍、豈不較為正確、</p>
<p>斯氏繼評今日之托洛茨基主義云、吾黨同志未注意托洛茨基主義早已不成其為工人階級中的政治潮流之一、不知托洛茨基主義已從七八年前之工人階級政治潮流變為瘋狂無原則的破壤•顚覆•間諜•及暗殺黨徒、遵照外國情報機關之命令行事、今日之托派份子、不敢露其眞面目於工入階級之前不敢揭佈其眞目的及任務、彼等努力使工人階級不知其政治面目、因恐工人階級發現其眞用意之後、將斥彼等為人民之敵、而加以驅逐也、關於此點、斯氏復述反蘇托派中心一案所揭露之托派政綱、為恢復資本主義、取消集體及國營農塲、恢復剝削制度、聯合德日法西斯蒂勢力、從進對蘇聯的戰爭、擁護戰爭、反對和平政策、瓜分蘇聯領土、割讓烏克蘭與德國、海濱省興日本、籌備於蘇聯被敵人進攻時、使其戰敗、為違到此目的、乃展開破壞及顚覆活動、對蘇維埃政權領袖施行個人恐怖為日德法西斯勢力充當間諜、凡此均庇亞塔夫•拉狄克•及蘇柯尼柯夫所揭露之今日托洛茨基主義政網、</p>
<p>斯氏問曰、吾人何以竟不注意上述一切、何以竟完全遺忘乎、其故蓋因近年來、吾黨同志、乃注全力於經濟工作、為經濟成功所迷、而因迷於經濟成功之故、乃竟遺忘其他一切、彼等因迷於經濟成功、乃開始以為此乃一切的一切•從而竟不注意蘇聯的國際形勢、其資本主義的環境、黨的政治工作之加緊、反破壞活動之鬥爭等任務、假定此類問題之重要乃屬第二流、或甚至第三流、</p>
<p>斯氏特別嚴厲批判矜誇自大之傾向、低估敵人之勢力、高估本身的力量、以及正當社會主義建設方而獲得偉大重要成功之時、此種政治上的盲目之結果、</p>
<p>斯氏指出淸算此種缺點之方法稱、第一、必須使迷醉於各部例行公事之吾黨同志、轉而注意國際及國內性質的重要政治問題、必項提高吾黨政治工作、至應有之高度、首以政治敎育•以及黨務•蘇維埃及經濟幹部之布爾雪維克的訓練等問題為基礎、</p>
<p>吾人必須粉碎並拋棄下列的不良理論、以為吾人苟前進－步、吾國內階級鬥爭將更加沉寂、吾人愈成功、吾階級敵人卽愈馴良、正相反、吾人愈益前進、愈益成功、彼被粉碎的剝削階級將愈益憤怒、彼等將愈益迅速採取更尖銳的鬥爭形式、對蘇維埃政權將愈益搗亂、將採用更亡命的鬥爭手段、作為垂死者的孤注、吾人必須粉碎並拋棄下列不良理論、以為托派破壞者已無後備軍、已用書其最後幹部、托派確有其後備軍、首先卽為蘇聯被粉碎各剝削階級之殘餘、以及國外敵視蘇聯之各種集團及組織、例如托派反革命的第四國際、其中三分之二為間諜及顚覆家、又如挪威之賊徒雪夫洛的集團、彼曾保護該超間諜托洛茨基本人、助彼搗亂蘇聯、又如法國之蘇伐林集團、以及德國之大批紳士、如羅士•費許斯•馬斯洛夫•及烏朋賽斯等、出賣肉體及靈魂與法西斯蒂之流、彼輩豈不能為托派間諜破壞工作供給後備軍、又如美國以著名賊徒意斯特曼為首之一切舞文弄墨的匪徒、專以攻擊蘇聯工人階級為生的匪徒、彼輩豈不能為托洛茨基主義供給生力軍、此種以為托派業已用盡其幹部之不良理論、决不能成立、必須立加拋棄、</p>
<p>斯氏最後建議、施行領導黨務幹部及提㧞新的領導工作人員之整個方法系統、最後結束云、吾人今進一步列舉必要的基本措置、以便淸算外國情報機關的托派法西斯蒂密探之顚覆的破壞間諜恐怖活動、使其成為無害、否人固擁有一切實現此種措置之必要手段也、云云、（二十九日塔斯電）</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>天津隊組織嚴密昨又勝軍聯隊</h3>
<p>結果五比一軍聯守衛軟弱　姜璐獨中四球津隊昨北返</p>
<p>天津埠際足球隊昨又以五比一擊敗以勞逸爾為代表之軍聯聯、昨出塲之唯一華人選手姜璐獨中四球之多、博得逸園座上三四千觀衆之熱烈推崇、該隊此行、初以八比三大勝上海埠際隊、次以二比二和上海中華隊、昨為最後二戰、卽於當夜乘滬平通車凱旋北返、此次戰績予滬上球迷極良好之印象、</p>
<p>津隊組織嚴密</p>
<p>天津埠際隊組織嚴寗、呼應有方、更以敏捷之前鋒綫、而造成此次光榮之戰績、昨戰中軍人攻勢固亦殊盛、無如不能深入禁地、少射門機會、卽有之、亦每以球運不佳而成野球、且內衛殊軟弱、守門如同虛設、敵騎一至、卽禍事不小、五比一之比數、實為當然之結果、要無卜半時之十一碼球、則吃光蛋也無疑矣、</p>
<p>上半時二比零</p>
<p>軍聯開球先攻、其墊頗盛、為時不久、津隊喧賓奪主、大顯威風、霍威初試脚頭過門不中、一試再試、又未得利、瓊斯頭頂、中柱而回、情勢猖獗、軍人招架為難、久而久之卒由姜璐得瓊司之傳球、首開紀錄軍聯極力反攻、聲勢汹汹、幾次攻門僅差毫釐、上半時終了前之三分鐘、傑漢遜又中一球成、與零之比、</p>
<p>軍聯得十二碼</p>
<p>下半時開賽剛五分鐘、軍聯前衛不愼被透纳溜近、傳至門前、姜璐趕上乘內部空虛、從容踢入、未幾、霍威再中、以越位取消、軍聯前鋒屢次攻打敵營、困於對方之嚴𡩋堡壘格格不入、－次推勒引球飛奔包金漢見勢不佳、猛力推撞被判罰十二碼球、軍聯遂破光蛋紀錄、由夏泊斯跟進成三比一、</p>
<p>姜璐又中兩球</p>
<p>軍聯繼續壓迫、津隊門前時見軍人蹤跡、津隊前後衛恊力保守、無懈可擊、而軍聯守衛散漫、客軍偶、引進、卽有措手不及之勢、守門呆笨、尤為令人失望、姜璐一次遠傳、竟中門角守門之弱、於此可見、此後軍聯攻勢、雖較津隊為盛、終無射門機會、三十五分鐘時姜璐得霍威之傳、又中一球、遂成五比一之結果、雙方陣綫如下、</p>

<p>當由主席邢琬報告紀念意義、略謂、今天是革命先烈的紀念日、也就是二十六年前黃花崗七十二烈士成仁取義的紀念日、先烈的革命精神、到現在還是很深刻地印在我們腦筋裏、假如不是革命先烈當年奮鬥犧牲、則滿淸專制政體、决不會迅速推翻、中華民國、决不會迅速建立、假如中華民國不建立、則我們民旅也决不會像現在這樣蓬蓬勃勃地走上光榮的復興大道、所以在全國統一建設猛進文化發展民氣昂揚的今日、來紀念革命先烈、我覺得特別有意義、第一、辛亥三月二十九日、廣州舉事、適在總理第九次革命失敗以後這時革命黨人、因新遭失敗、意志沮喪、兼以淸廷防範、格外嚴厲、在這樣惡劣的環境中、革命先烈竟不顧一切、作最後的奮鬥、此次發難有二百餘人、結果、雖然還是失敗、但大多數同志、都能慷慨激昂、從容就義、頭可殺而志不可奪、始終沒有絲亳屈服妥恊的態度、殉難先烈、雖名為七十二人、其實不知姓名者、尚有數十人、這－種果敢無畏的精神、眞足以驚天地而泣鬼神、我們處於大敵當前的現在、是應該效法他們的、第二、這一次革命雖然失敗、但是革命的進行、卻因此推進了一多、為武昌起義、種下一粒很有效的種子、總理曾說、“集各省革命黨之精英、與彼虜為最後之一搏、事雖不成、而黃花崗七十二烈士轟轟烈烈之概、已震動全球、國內革命之時勢、實以之造成、”因為自經革命先烈這一擊、卻震醒了全國的人心、增加了黨員的勇氣、轉移了列强的視聽、辛亥革命所以容易成功、未始非種因於此、這樣看來、革命先烈、雖然流血犧性、可是這種流血犧牲、卻是後來革命成功的代價、中華民國的開國史、便是他們的赤血染成的、我們已經明白、革命先烈紀念的意義、還應該有三點認識、㊀革命先烈、何以會有這樣果敢無畏的精神呢、無疑地、是因他們對於三民主義有精確的認識、深刻的信仰、并且中華民國是應該以三民主義來建設的、沒有三民主義便沒有中華民國、無論在空間上或時間上都絕對不容有兩個主義存在、信仰三民主義的及為三民主義而努力的、我們都願與之精神團結、共禦外侮、否則便是中華民國的叛徒、也就是革命先烈的叛徒、㊁中華民國是整個的、不容分裂的、假如有人硬要興風作浪、將革命先烈流血犧性換來的中華民國、弄得支離破碎、無論他是外寇、或是內奸、也無論假借任何名義或口號、都足以斷送中華民國的前途、須知道中國民族獲解放與否、是要以力量為前提、所謂力量、自然是包括武力財力和民力、多一次內戰、便削弱一次國力、削弱國力、就無異自殺、也就無異替敵人幫忙、現在中國已完成眞正的和平統一了、我們只有永遠保障這個對內的和平統一、統對得住為革命而犧牲的革命先烈、㊂三民主義、是以民生為中心、只有完成民生主義的經濟建設、纔算是達到革命的目的革命先烈所以不屈不撓、甘於犧牲生命、决不只是為推翻滿淸政府、乃是要更進一步、使四萬萬人民、都得衣住行之滿足、所以我們一方面固然要確保領土主權之完整、另一方面也要使整個中國民族、在經濟上獲得共享的福利、因此創造國家資本和保護私人資本、便是現階段最重要的任務、卽就抗禦外侮一端而論、我們自力的經濟建設、也是不可或緩的、末了、希望各位從今以後、要繼續革命先烈的奮鬥精神、用血和肉的代價、來換得中國民族的自由平等、</p>

<p>上海民之女子中學十三周年校慶紀念特刊</p>
<h3>紀念詞</h3>
<p>— 董事長吴開先</p>
<p>本校自創辦迄今，歷三十寒暑•在此已往的三十寒暑中，各種設備，雖因經濟力之限制，未能臻於吾人理想之境地：而各地靑年學子，負岌來校肄業者，年有增加。本學期學生數量，竟達九百人，攷其籍貫，遍及全國各省市，在此女子敎育尚未普及之時，面有如許生徒，不違千里而來，足徵本校過去，常在一自然發展的狀態之中，故能引起國內人士之密切注意焉！令者本校欣逢三十周年紀念之期，全體師生發起於本月三十日舉行校慶紀念大會，以示歡慶；並展覽最近三年來之成績，以求社會人士之批評與指導；敬本三十而以之古訓，略抒所感，以勵將來</p>
<p>第一，辦學是一種神聖的社會事業，其使命之重大，盡人皆知！蓋社會之健全與否，胥視乎學校敎育之良窮而後定。學校有好敎育，則此輩曾受好敎育薰陶之靑年，即為社會國家之健全細胞；如學校辦理不善，學生受有不良影響，則此輩靑年，即為社會國家之危險份子，影響於民族前途者，至為重大。且中等敎育為靑年生活之重要關鍵，旣可彌補小學敎育之缺憾，復足樹立大學敎育之基礎，關係重大，不言可喩！昔備國毛奇將軍嘗調：“德意志之强盛，緣於小學敎育的成功！”可見學校敎育之成功與失敗，足以左右國家的運命，其可不審愼出之乎？吾人際此三十週年盛會之時，瞻前顧後，切望全校師生，一本過去服務社會之精神，本校原定之計劃，加緊化導，努力進修，為社會多製造健全的細胞，為國家多培植良好的人才。</p>
<p>第二，吾人以為女子敎育，應注重於母性之培育與生活技能之養成。因現代社會構成，由於家庭組織；而家庭組織之基礎，由於配偶關係如不能維持永久，或母性不能盡其職責，均足以引起家庭之不安，搖撼社會組織之基礎•自歐化東漸以來，國，於一切生活，兢尚新奇，婚姻視為兒戲，家庭有若長途，言念及此，感喟萬端！蓋家庭之倫理道德與生活技能，均為維持夫婦正常關係之細帶，無論為家庭利平或子女幸福，均有賴手此紐帶之維繫。因此吾人不憚大聲疾呼，促現代靑年憬然覺悟於配偶關係之神聖，與家庭責任之重要，而今日女子敎育，尤須注意於培育德性，與生活技能之養成，以為樹立健全家庭之先聲。</p>
<p>第三，我國婦女，向來忽於本身體格之鍛練，而家中父老，對此尤多糢糊不清之認識。遂致柳腰蓮步，譽為美談，此種傳統的錯覺，為造成中華民族數千年來積弱的主因；蓋母性旣如此贏弱，所出子女，必為此先天缺憾所貽誤！年來政府敎育政策，雖積極提倡女子體育，以强國本，惟惡習未除，推行匪易；甚望本校師生積極提倡，務使每人於智德體三育，俱有平均的發展，固不能以造就幾個運動選手而遽為滿足也</p>
<p>以上三點，為吾人最低限度的要求，想本校在童校長主持之下，必能向此三個標的沉着邁進，固無待吾人煩述者也。</p>
<h3>名譽董事長吳鐵城先生</h3>
<h3>校務概況</h3>
<p>— 校長童行白</p>
<p>弁言</p>
<p>本人奉命長校，業已三年。在這三年之中，因為在經濟與環境的交互壓迫之下，很慚愧的，殊少有所建樹。不過為求女子敎育的發展計，除了擴充校舍外，並努力於設備之充實，與人事的改進。更承社會人士的維護，各方學子的謬采虛聲，最近兩學期的學生人數，驟增至九百人以上，突破了從來未有的新紀錄。這一點雖可告慰於愛護本校的社會人士，但也增加了我們在敎育上的責任；以後本校師生雖願集中人力財力以求物資精神兩方、面的發展，期得更大的成就外，甚望社會人士，敎育名流，在輔助與督促的兩重同情心之上，使我們達到女子敎育理想的水準。</p>
<p>甲　校史</p>
<p>民國紀元前六年，山王蘇本嵒姊妹五人，創設本校於西鬥外源壽里，民國二年呈請上海縣政府撥地自建校舍於西門文廟路口；十六年本校校董會照章改組，推王蘇本嵒為校長。二十年呈准市敎育局立案，敎育部備案；二十三年二月奉市敎育局令改組校董會，並推行白為校長，以迄於今，前後凡三十年。本校在二十三年度前，牟校行政并未詳細劃分，致辦事發展，不免困難；同年度奉局令改組後，訂立行政系統，厘訂學則，確定訓敎方針及發展計劃；並建造新校舍，充實設備，整飭風紀，提高程度，因之來舉者由三百餘人逐年遞增至九百餘人。值茲立校三十週年，謹將校務近況及改進計劃，作簡略之報告，幸國人有以指正之焉。</p>
<p>乙　總務方面</p>
<p>（一）設備方面</p>
<p>本校自新校舍落成後，一切設備，尚未完全。自由三年度第一學期起，如理化儀器•圖書。修繕•體育等另行規定經費，逐步添置，故于三年內，除原有者不計外，統計添置埋化，醫藥•體育•童子軍用具。圖書等。不下一萬元；更另闢理化實驗室，盥洗室各一所；敎員浴室兩間；敎職員宿舍•男女校工宿舍各一間；藏書室•圖書館•閱鑒室•校醫室•調養室，儲藏室各一間；並將全校課棹課椅•以年級高低及年齡大小•概行重新添置•其他一切敎具用具，尤難數計。嗣後更當逐漸增添，使設備方面。日趨完善。</p>
<p>（二）校舍方面</p>
<p>本校校舍原為中座樓房二十一幢，後座樓房六幢，平屋四間，前面東邊三摟一座，祗可容納學生四五百人，原感不敷•自改組後，西邊平屋一座，于甘三年度改建五層新校舍•上學期起，學生增至九百餘人。教室增至十七級。人數雖　增，幸能利用空間，將不必要房舍予以修葺，尚可應用。此後如不積極計劃，將中座樓房覇造，來學者擁擠堪虞。查新校舍計高五層，底層分七間為辦公室，二三四層分為十二教室，五層為充平頂，學生游息之所。然以人數衆多，空地殊感不足，除向空間發展外，實無展布之可能，不無遺憾耳</p>

<h3>吹糖的藝術家</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>𪮝揑粉人者，被文人們譽為街頭的無名藝術家，似乎具有着很悠久的歷史了。可是一般的文人對於吹糖者的藝術，似科沒曾有人提到過。</p>
<p>在平民們住居的所在，更其是貧民窟中，是常可見到此輩吹糖者的足跡。吹糖者的擔兒和𪮝粉人的，是相仿的。二個交叉架，支特着一個木匣兒，便是工作的塲所。在木匣兒上，聳豎着一個柴帚兒，便是用以蝟集着吹成的各種玩意兒的所在。當這種工作者，把担停下來，或在工作進行中，間隔了一個相當的時間，而把那個破了的小鑃，鐺鐺地打着幾下時，在他的前面，總是文卽圍聚着小孩子們，用着貪婪的眼光瞧着，而意識着這種好玩的東西，是當有甜味的。然而吹糖者，豈只為小孩子所歡迎，成人們，也儘有駐足而驚歎其藝術之高超的。</p>
<p>若是𪮝粉人者，被譽為街頭的藝衛家，那麼，吹糖的，似科更可當之而無愧。因為𪮝粉人者，雖說技術超羣，然而究還是難免於有堆砌雜湊之嫌，而吹糖的，却能把整整的一塊兒糖，隨意的拉出一絲來，而從這細細的一絲中，把氣吹入整塊的糖兒裏，而使那糖兒，膨賬起來。更用嫻熟的手法，把這膨賬着的糖製成了鷄，鴨，貓，狗。技術較精的，更能吹出女舉生，紅頭阿三等形態來。雖然有精緻上面說來，是夠不上𪮝粉人者的產品，然而我人若以二十世紀的眼光看來，吹糖者的產品，色澤單純，綫條粗整，輪廓雄偉，似乎倒頗有些兒所謂後期印象派的風味。但這不過是這麼說說而已，對於這種街頭小販，而談這些，說話，是準會被人目為瘋子的。</p>
<p>最近，我和一個吹糖者閒談着，才知吃這一碗飯，也不容易。要習得能自糖絲中吹氣的技能，非有二三年的練習不可。習得吹氣的技能之後，於是再學吹小夜壺，水烟袋等一類簡單的東西。學會了士餘種，才能出來賣技而騙錢。雖然他們是並沒有同行的案親，但據說，現在在外混混的，可絕對沒有不會十幾種玩意兒的吹𪮝的。大致技術較差的，都在內地各處活動著。在上海等大都市中，吹糖糊口的，會二三十種玩意兒的吹製的，並沒甚麼希罕。本領高强的，能見到甚麼，便吹甚麼。然而這究竟不貴族化的玩意兒，所以據說，收入最佳的，每天也不過大洋半元而已•好在此輩，大半都是江蘇北部各地的農民，在農閒時，浮家而來蘇滬各地，以此為副業的，所以收入雖微，倒也並不是一個嚴重的問題</p>
<p>但是從衛生的立塲上說來，吹糖者，吹成的東西，小孩子們，作為可口的糖食，我人試閉目一想，其危險為何如</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>地中海西部將來之地位</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>西班牙內戰事件，據昨日倫敦時報稱，此間皆覺羅馬已破壞中立協定，孟却斯德保衛報稱，現在西班牙之戰事，早非內戰，地中海西部將來之地位，已成問題云云。確眞，西班牙戰事，名義上係屬內戰，而事實上已屬外戰，固已人盡皆知的事，不過此種外戰，能不能因此次不干涉西班牙內戰監察計劃，而漸次消除，還是因此更欲欲擴大？原是當前的一個極重要問題！</p>
<p>西國叛軍的首領，是弗朗哥將軍，但是這位將軍，完全是一個愧儡，而在幕后操縱的，確是另有其人，呼之欲出，故此次西班牙之戰爭，與其說是內戰與外戰，不若說法西斯與非法西斯的戰爭，較為恰當，到現在為止，西班牙內亂的戰爭，已經數月之久，還是如鋸木式的屢進屢退，勝負未分，所最受痛苦的，便是西班牙的人民，其生命財產的犧牲，恐難以數字計算，其結果只是被雙方賭博者為孤注之一擲，在西班牙所為何來？</p>
<p>我因此想到西班牙的內戰，雖則為法西斯與非法斯的較力擂台，但究竟因國內的不幸，產生了叛亂的份子，野心勃發的梟傑，致被國外勢力的侵入，假定國內沒有如弗朗哥將軍其人，則他國勢力雖欲侵入，亦無從侵入，所謂“籬笆破野狗鑽，”此固為西班牙之大不幸，但是照現在的形勢，已弄得如是的殭，非但西班牙自己無從收拾，卽使從傍帮兇的人，一時亦無從收拾。</p>
<p>現在英法諸國，鑑於西班牙的內亂，大有延長擴大之勢，因此發起不干涉西班牙內戰委員會，並且規定海陸監察計劃，表示大家不准再去帮忙西國內亂的任何一方面，假定此種計劃果能實行，實行而果能有效，原是一個息事寗人的絕好機會，但是此種計劃，在非法西斯方面，天然贊同，而在法西斯的德國，則假癡假呆。不作表示，意國則十分積極，大有非將西班牙踏為平地，不肯罷手之勢，因為意國帮忙判軍，其力量巳屬不細，據俄報所稱，意軍開入西班牙者，巳有六萬人之多，意國用如是龐大的兵力，而不能倒翻政府，在面子方面亦有些過不去也。</p>
<p>故意和對淤不干涉西班牙內戰委員會，始終抱若迎若拒的態度，不過此次海陸軍監察計劃，而不能收相當之效果，共勢必將化西班牙之內戰，而為世界的大戰，亦未可知，我甚懼焉。</p>
<h3>廢城</h3>
<p>— 雅憫</p>
<p>黃昏，我爬上滿洲城的城頂，立在斷堞殘雉間，下臨傾圮的前朝的建築。血紅的霞光淹沒全城，我似乎站在羅馬大火後的廢墟裏，憑弔城中昔日的繁榮。</p>
<p>還只幾十年前的繁榮那裏去了，如今盡我的眼力搜尋不出一幢稍形完整的屋宇。沒有街衢，沒有店鋪；房屋的遺骸橫躺下來，砸碎青石板路。是晚飯的時間，城中却飛不起一縷炊烟。屋子撕碎遮羞的房頂，袒開她的胸膛給荒涼的風，遺失了棺蓋的野柩似的。野狗隨時可鑽進內屋，不必經門，在破楹廢灶旁悠然地蹺起後腿來澆一泡尿。房角的陰𤂽裏青草蓊茂地長起來了。</p>
<p>這城裏的居民呢？抽着長烟袋在街上閒踱的女人，喜聞鼻烟的，從生下來就支領着皇家口糧的男子。這些征服者如今都那裏去了，連墓都不曾留一個。只有一個老乞丐倚在半截殘垣上脫下破襖來捉蚤子，一隻癩狗舐他腿上的惡瘡。我認識他，孩子們呌他“老滿州”。據說還是個“巴圖魯勇”呢。如今這不肖的于孫已沒了祖先的光榮，仰仗他故日的奴隸們憐憫過活。祖先十三匹馬馱十三副甲胄打天下的故事在他已是逝去的榮耀。</p>
<p>都統府孤高的旗桿慘然地俯視脚下府第的殘跡，將近睡倒的門樓伴着他。如今只有他還高高地站着，支撑昔日的尊嚴。可是為歲月和風雨所殘蝕，他衰老的體子也日益消瘦了。北地的風是無常的，說不定那天他會搖着躺下去，讓打柴的孩子結束了他最後的命運。現在，殘陽光裏他羞紅着臉為雲彩叙述舊日的夢。光秃的桿項上亦沒有黃龍旗的招</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>展。</p>
<p>也或者旗杆還能指岀：在這城中那是貝子府，那是旗營。閙市上有戴紅纓帽的騎兵馳過，戲館裏人聲喧嚷，茶寮裏擠滿吃茶的人。可是如今却成一片沙礫的荒塲，破殘的垣牆間盪漾一片輕綃似的晚烟。</p>
<p>暮色沿着城堞昇起，我踉蹌地走下城墻。在幽深的城門口那忠實的老守門人已經等在那兒了。我像平日一樣地打一個招呼。</p>
<p>“關城門了嗎？”</p>
<p>“不再玩一會嗎？其實這城門也不必關了。”老頭兒苦笑着，一個歎息消失在蒼白的鬚邊。我看見老頭兒臉上有不勝其今昔的寂寞。</p>
<p>默然走岀城來，城門發戞戞的聲音斬斷我依依回顧的目光。</p>
<h3>在路上</h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>愁展不展的秋天，當着你不僅瞧不見太陽，而且也感覺不到犬陽，甚至忘記了它的時候，秋天的林塲中，每每有迷失道路的事情發生的。你從大道上被人扣掉下來，迷失了一切小徑，找尋它得疲倦了，你咬緊牙關，直朝前面的密林邁步，跨過腐爛的風㧞倒的樹木，跨過崎嶇的泥濘之坵山！最最末了，你每每會尋出－條大道來的！</p>
<p>每次，找對一件棘手的事感到失望的時候，總是躺在床上，兩隻眼睛望着灰色的天花板，或者瞧着天空的流雲怎樣變換，怎樣走路，最後疲倦地嘆息着，回想着那件棘手的事情。</p>
<p>在我們家庭裏，嘆息是不允許的。長輩會嚴厲地責問你：“年輕輕的，為什么嘆氣呢？”他們獎勵一個人挺着胸，一點不懦弱地走路。在長長的人生的道路上，自然也是如此。然而，我時常嘆息，從屠格𣵀夫的散文，小說裏學來了不少句子，什么：烟，什麽事情不是烟呵！……年青青的，我就很憂鬱地中活着，可是，我又愛春天，愛活潑。我就在這樣矛盾的泥濘的路上走路。</p>
<p>後来，我讀了高爾基底書，受着他書裏面的故事底敎育，參加進新的河流，過着新的生活。可是，還常常疲倦，坐在路旁，兩手撫着頭，讓寒冷的夜風吹着。高爾基，這輝煌的語言家，人類靈魂的偉大技師，他就說的上面的話。—“……你每每會尋出－條大道來的。”</p>
<p>於是，我又走路了。</p>
<p>呵，這崎嶇的泥濘的路，盡頭在那兒呢？我一邊向前望着，一邊㧞出這隻脚放下去，又費力地㧞出那一隻來……</p>
<p>在路上走的時候，也不知道有多少人過來向你說話，他們用着各種不同的方式，說看不同的話，而且很肯定地說，好像唯有他底路正確的：</p>
<p>“年輕人！這路是永無止境的，在這路上，是怕害和苦惱，雖然有人說，那終點的地方有著太陽光和溫暖的春風，但是，你見過幾個人走到終點呢？—說那兒快樂的人，現在都死掉了。”說着他從衣袋裏拿出一張畫件，那上面畫着一片綠野，野地上有成雙的青年男女嘻嘻哈哈地玩着。他說：“你還是停一下吧，這兒可以很快樂地過一輩子。”然而，他不允許我看一看畫底背面，因為那上面是骷髏。</p>
<p>又過來一個人，他說：</p>
<p>“年輕人：你追求太陽，追求光明，是一件非常直得佩服的事，可是，你沒看見嗎，在前面，在後面，不知道多少人死去了，你踏着的士地，就是他們底血，肉和白骨築成的。這是件很困難的事。”他裝作很關心我的樣子，對我說：“你還是按我指給你的方法走路吧，因為那些死去的人，都是太好反抗了，大好動手動脚了，一隻樹技擋着他底路了，他一定毀了他，一條小⾍咬了他底脚，他就踏死他，以致，他遇到大的風暴，死在黑暗的深河裏！你要慢慢地走，有人擋你，不理他，坐下休息一會兒，有人拖住你不讓走，或者要你倒退幾里，你就躺下爽爽快快地休息好了！</p>
<p>“那麼，先生，你沒有看見路旁的血字碑嗎？那上面留着過去的人們底話：年青人，追上去！把一切障碍除掉，終點就到了！</p>
<p>“那是呌你快些送命的話！”</p>
<p>我沒理他，一直向前走。各式各樣的嚕囌的話不斷地截住我，硬朝我說。他們底嘴好像是鐵打的，也不怕磨破。</p>
<p>有時，路旁邊臥着一位呼吸緊促的老人，他說：</p>
<p>“年青人，快些走吧，終點就到了———我稍微換換氣，就會追你去的！……不要停，前面就到了！”</p>
<p>路旁的那些先生們就冷冷地笑着說：“看呵，這老頭子，他在拍青年人底馬屁了，——他想呌青年人在到終點的時候給他作紀念，開追悼會，或者把他接過去養老！”他們很得意的擺出清高的架子來，笑了！手脚亂舞着，還回過頭去弄鬼臉。</p>
<p>路是長的，好像無盡顯的……然而我終於看見已經走到那兒的人們豎起的鮮明的旗幟在春風裏招展了，那邊快樂的歌聲，不斷地飄蕩過來……人們在向我熱烈地招手，伸出爾條粗大的臂膀，等待着我跑過去，做一個長久的擁抱！</p>
<p>可是，路是難走的，在這潮濕的秋天的夜霧瀰漫的路上，不是有兇惡的猛牛來叮你底肉，樹枝扯住你底衣服，泥濘的路把你滑倒，人們嘲笑你鼻子長得不好看，眼睛沒他漂亮，個子沒地威武，……那麼，就一切都不管吧，踏啐一切障碍，跌倒再爬起來，向前勇敢的邁步吧！“你咬緊牙關，直朝前面的密林邁步，跨過腐爛的風㧞倒的樹木，跨過崎嶇的泥濘的坵山，——最最末了，你每每會尋出一條大道來的！”而且，那大道的終點，已經有人達到，他們向你招手，唱着歌，準備擁抱你了……</p>
<p>回頭看看千萬的人羣跟着你，和你朝一個方向走！……前進！</p>
<h3>鄉土</h3>

<p>那巨大的鐵的迷宮是雄偉的，許多高貴的異邦人穿梭般地來往着，但在一個角落裏，我却看見一個襤褸的同胞，他的油垢的長衫在輝煌的船燈下發亮。</p>
<p>他猛然瞥了我們一眼，隨卽就追在</p>

<h3>Public Memorial Service at the Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang</h3>
<p>Chairman Lin Personally Leads Civil and Military Officials to Attend, Party and Government Representatives from Various Provinces and Cities Gather, Attendance Reaches Over 100,000</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] At 6:00 AM, Chairman Lin personally led hundreds of Guangdong civil and military officials to Huanghuagang for a public memorial service. People from all walks of life arrived successively to pay their respects, reaching over 100,000 people. The atmosphere was extremely solemn and tragic. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] On the 29th, Guangzhou was overcast with dense clouds and drizzling rain. The entire city flew flags at half-mast and suspended all music and entertainment, in memory of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang who, twenty-six years ago on this very day and in this very place, knew they would die but still generously sacrificed themselves to shake the Qing dynasty and lay the foundation for the nation. At 7:00 AM, Chairman Lin of the National Government, in full ceremonial attire, solemnly led military officials including Chen Cheng, Pacification Director Yu Hanmou, Chief of Staff of the Military Headquarters Luo Zhuoying, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army Xiang Hanping, Mayor of Guangzhou Zeng Yangfu, and party and government representatives from cities like Nanjing and Wuhan, as well as provinces like Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Henan, and Ningxia, to the tomb of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang outside Guangzhou to respectfully offer sacrifices, present flowers, perform the highest salute, and recite the memorial text. The ceremony was solemn and respectful. After Chairman Lin finished the ceremony, representatives from all sectors of Guangdong, party and government representatives from various provinces and cities, and representatives from various institutions and organizations successively paid their respects, from morning till night. The number of people who came to pay their respects exceeded 100,000. In addition to paying respects to the revolutionary martyrs of Huanghuagang, all sectors also separately paid respects to the four martyrs of Honghuagang and the tomb of Shi Jianru. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] The memorial text of Chairman Lin's sacrifice to the martyrs of Huanghuagang reads: "On this, the 29th day of March in the 26th year of the Republic of China, Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, respectfully offers incense, flowers, and pure wine to the spirits of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang. The text says: 'Deep worries inspire sages, and many difficulties revive the nation. Safety and danger test talent, and the fortunes of time are often submerged. If the rule of the barbarians does not fall, how can the Han way prosper? Only our Premier, with his wisdom in Huiyang, gathered the masses in Dongjiao, his wisdom and courage soaring. Valiant martyrs, your integrity is as firm as autumn frost. You swore to die nine times, hoping to achieve a great victory. You planned to launch a heavenly crusade, intending to continue the cutting down of the Shang. How could it not succeed, leaving no traces behind? The nests were not swept away, yet loyal and virtuous were abruptly killed. Facing death as if it were sweetness, shoulder to shoulder. Your spirit terrified the barbarian court, your souls returned to heaven. Since ancient times, everyone has done their best, what is valued is the national mourning. Ah, the martyrs, your bodies are exhausted, your names glorified, buried in the green for thousands of years, on the hill of yellow flowers. Passersby weep in the rain, the sun and moon dim their light. Erect stone tablets, offer fragrant incense. Though the years change, your great achievements are hard to forget. May you enjoy this sacrifice.' (Central News Agency dispatch on the 29th)"</p>
<h3>Central Authorities Hold Joint Memorial Service</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] At 9:00 AM on the 29th, the Central Committee and the National Government jointly held Premier's Memorial Week and a memorial meeting for revolutionary martyrs in the Central Auditorium. Attendees included Central Committee members Wang Zhaoming, Zou Lu, Dai Chuanxian, Chen Lifu, He Yingqin, Sun Ke, Wang Boqun, Wang Longhui, Jiang Zuobin, Li Wenfan, Zhang Qun, Ma Chaojun, and dozens of others, as well as representatives from various ministries and departments of the National Government, including Xu Chonghao, Xie Guansheng, Chen Youfeng, Wang Guqing, Chen Haicheng, and Huang Jianzhong, and staff from various departments of the Central Party Headquarters, including Wang Qijiang, Shen Juntao, and Shen Yuanming, totaling approximately 800 people. Chairman Zou Lu presided over the meeting. After the music was played, everyone bowed to the portrait of the Premier and the tablets of the martyrs, observed a moment of silence, and offered wreaths. Zou then gave a report, stating that the Huanghuagang Uprising was one of the most tragic and magnificent events in the history of the revolution, indirectly laying the foundation for the Republic of China, inspiring a revolutionary climax, and forming the effect of the Wuchang Uprising. The reason why the martyrs continued to sacrifice and struggle was entirely due to their belief in the Three People's Principles and their understanding of national consciousness. Therefore, the greater the pressure, the greater and stronger the revolutionary resistance. At the same time, we know that the success of the revolution requires material strength, but more importantly, it requires a central idea and purpose. As long as we disregard success or failure, regardless of life or death, and have a tragic spirit, we can ultimately overcome material deficiencies and reach the path to success. Therefore, we know that the great spirit of the martyrs is not only the foundation for nation-building but also an element of national revival. At present, the national crisis is serious, and we must encourage each other with the spirit of the martyrs, seek life from death, and complete the task of national revival.

From now on, the central and local governments should thoroughly integrate. The central government's instructions to the local governments and the provincial government's requests to the central government have been discussed and concrete solutions have been reached. On the second day of his arrival in Nanjing, he visited President Chiang, who expressed his sincerity and said that he has always trusted Chairman Liu in Sichuan affairs and is determined to support Chairman Liu in reorganizing Sichuan. Moreover, in the current national environment, if the country is not thoroughly unified internally, it is not enough to talk about saving the country from extinction. He deeply hopes that the central and local governments must thoroughly integrate.

The central government's entrustment is very important, and everything should be done according to the leader's intentions.

Every day he met with He and Zhang, and all problems have been concretely solved. Last night, he also met with Minister He.

<h3>Various Railroads Improve Passenger Car Equipment</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Railways believes that since the entire Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Railway line has opened to traffic, it is convenient for passengers traveling north and south, and the Nanping section of the Zhegan (Zhejiang-Jiangxi) Railway is under construction. The Qiantang River Bridge will also be completed this year. After fully connecting with the provinces of Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, foreign tourists can land in Hong Kong and take the Yuehan Railway directly to Central China, Southeast China, and North China. In the future, passenger cars on various railroads should be improved. The proposal was made by Huang Boqiao, director of the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou) and Huning (Shanghai-Nanjing) Railway Bureaus, and negotiations were held with the International Wagon-Lits Company. It is heard that the company's military vehicles have been basically decided. Once the method is agreed upon, it will be implemented. In addition, special express trains will be opened on the Yuehan Railway, and vehicles ordered from the United Kingdom have been shipped to China. There are a total of five sets, each set consisting of one first-class sleeper car, one second-class passenger car, four third-class sleeper cars, and one dining car, baggage car, and guard car. It has been reported to the Ministry of Railways that the cars are fully assembled. Special express trains are scheduled to open on April 1, departing once a day from Wuchang and Guangzhou stations. This can reduce the current travel time by one-third. The Jinjiang (Tianjin-Pukou) Railway will reorganize telegraph, telephone, and electrical road signs, changing them to horizontal bar installations. A full set of dispatching telephone sets were purchased from the British General Electric Company to separate the shunting and allocation affairs from the original telephones.

<h3>The Impact of the Italian-Yugoslav Accord</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Yugoslavia, which is known as the "Balkan Axis," and its neighbor Italy have almost always been in a state of armed confrontation. Now, they are suddenly toasting each other and have concluded a political accord and an economic accord of great significance. This is a new victory for Mussolini's foreign policy. The political impact on the European situation is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia was originally France's largest satellite in the Balkans. However, the pro-Italian policy of the former French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister inevitably disappointed Yugoslavia. After the German National Socialist Party exerted its wrist in the Balkans, giving Yugoslavia generous economic benefits, Yugoslavia's attitude towards Germany changed. After the French Popular Front came to power, Franco-Yugoslav relations improved slightly, but Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović repeatedly stated that he did not want to be involved in any opposing European groups. As long as a country can give Yugoslavia economic benefits, he is willing to be friendly with it. It can be seen that it is impossible for France to pull Yugoslavia into an anti-German group.</p>
<p>As for Anglo-Yugoslav relations, Yugoslavia's current regent, Prince Paul, has a very close friendship with the British royal family. Former British King Edward VIII's tour of the Balkans last summer also won the favor of the Balkan countries, especially Yugoslavia. If British diplomats continue to actively pursue a friendly foreign policy in Yugoslavia, perhaps Yugoslavia would not be drawn in by Italy. However, the British Conservatives did not pay much attention to the foreign policy of the Balkan countries. Mussolini seized this opportunity and offered an olive branch to Yugoslavia with great enthusiasm. At the same time, Germany's opposition to the restoration of Hungary was also in line with Yugoslavia's position. Therefore, Yugoslavia felt that Germany and Italy were not as formidable as they had imagined. In addition, at the meeting of the Little Entente countries last September, a common resolution was reached. If collective security is impossible, the Little Entente countries can individually pursue coordination policies within the possible scope with other countries for the sake of their own security. In view of the fact that Britain and France could not provide security guarantees and economic benefits, why not accept Italy's favor?</p>
<p>Among the political and economic accords between Italy and Yugoslavia, the most important benefit obtained by Yugoslavia is the first item in the political accord, namely that Italy guarantees the security of Yugoslavia's land and sea borders. The most important benefit obtained by Italy is that Yugoslavia recognizes the Italian Empire. We know that in the past, Yugoslavia was often afraid of Italy invading its territory. Now Italy has clearly stated that it respects the common border of the Adriatic Sea. Yugoslavia can certainly be satisfied. However, Yugoslavia's recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia is nothing less than a betrayal of its former allies such as Britain, France, and the Little Entente, with regard to the collective security presided over by the League of Nations. Weighing the two, Yugoslavia is probably still losing more than it gains. Not only that, but Mussolini, due to the establishment of the Italian-Yugoslav accord, can both strengthen his diplomatic lineup and dominate the Balkan and Danube countries, and also let go of his hands to interfere in the Spanish Civil War without worrying about the rear. From now on, the waves of the Adriatic Sea may be temporarily calmed down, but the waves of the Mediterranean Sea will inevitably become more turbulent.</p>
<h3>Kodama Arrives in Nagasaki to Report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>Basis for Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation Said to Be Established</p>
<p>⊙Nagasaki: The economic observation group to China, Kodama Kenji, Shoji Otokichi, Fujiyama Aiichiro, and three others arrived in Nagasaki on the 28th. Mr. Kodama said, "I have already made a statement in Shanghai, and there is nothing new to talk about now. There are various rumors about our visit to China, but we firmly believe that this visit can serve as the basis for economic cooperation between China and Japan. As a result of the exchange of views between us and the Chinese treasure industry, we learned that Chinese treasure industrialists are willing to cooperate with Japanese industrialists. After I arrive in Tokyo, I will report everything to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but this does not have a political meaning." (29th Allied Electric)</p>
<h3>Japanese-Indian Conference Comes to an End</h3>

As a result of mutual consultations, the Indian side finally accepted the compromise proposal, which was formally announced in the name of both representatives and telegraphed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Thus, the Japanese-Indian Consultation, which lasted for nine months, came to a solution. The wording of the agreement can be completed within a few days, and then both representatives will hold a temporary signing ceremony, and the outline of the agreement will be announced at the same time. As for the formal signing, it can probably be done in London in mid-May. The contents of this announcement are recorded on the left: The Japanese representative and the Indian representative met on the 27th. The opinions of both parties have converged on the renewal of the current agreed minutes and the main provisions. That is, Japan can import cotton cloth to India, and the Indian cotton connected to its import volume. The opinions on the purchase volume are completely consistent. In addition, the opinions are also completely consistent on the allocation rate of various varieties of Japanese cotton cloth that should be distinguished by item and category, and the transfer rate between different varieties. Both representatives have started to draw up new agreed minutes, and once completed, they will announce the main points. (29th Allied Electric)</p>

<h3>Report on the Shortcomings of the Soviet Party Branch by Stalin</h3>
<p>Communist Party Members Are Obsessed with Construction Achievements and Neglect the Capitalist Countries' Conspiracies Against the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Moscow] Soviet Communist Party leader Stalin recently drafted a report on the 3rd of this month and submitted it to the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party, severely criticizing the party's various shortcomings and strongly advocating that existing leaders should be retrained, and that the party's internal organization and policies should be reformed. The report also pointed out the success of the Trotskyist faction's various sabotage activities, in order to show that past mistakes should be reformed. Party leaders, officials, and bureaucrats should all abide by the established rules of Leninism, so as not to be exploited by Trotskyists, according to a Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 29th.</p>
<p>[Moscow] In the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party on March 3 this year, Mr. Stalin presented a report commenting on the shortcomings of the party branch's work and the methods for clearing out Trotskyists and other traitors. The original text has now been published as follows:</p>
<p>Stalin first pointed out three basic facts: First, the sabotage, subversion, and espionage activities of foreign secret agents have affected our country's entire organization, or almost the entire organization, whether economic, administrative, or even party affairs, to varying degrees. Trotskyists have played an active role in this activity. Second, foreign secret agents, including Trotskyists, have not only infiltrated lower-level organizations, but have even obtained certain important positions. Third, some leading comrades of our party's central and provincial levels have failed to recognize the true faces of these saboteurs, subversives, spies, and assassins, and have instead been calm, frank, and inattentive to such an extent that they have often personally helped to introduce these foreign secret agents to responsible positions.</p>
<p>Stalin then analyzed the reasons for this situation, saying, "Our party comrades, because they are too enthusiastic about economic movements and the great achievements on the front lines of economic construction, have forgotten certain extremely important facts that Bolsheviks must never forget. They have forgotten that the Soviet Union is in a capitalist environment. This means that although the Soviet Union has established a socialist system, there are still many bourgeois countries that continue to live under capitalism. They surround the Soviet Union, waiting for an opportunity to attack it, destroy it, or at least weaken its power. Our party comrades have forgotten this basic fact, and this fact is the basis for determining the relationship between the capitalist environment and the Soviet Union." Stalin then pointed out that various bourgeois countries are sending spies, saboteurs, subversives, and sometimes even assassins to the interior of other countries. He then asked, "How can these bourgeois countries be more gentle and harmonious towards the Soviet socialist state than towards their own kind? From a Marxist point of view, wouldn't it be more accurate to assume that the bourgeois countries send twice or three times as many spies, saboteurs, subversives, and assassins to the Soviet Union's rear as they send to the rear of other bourgeois countries?"</p>
<p>Stalin then commented on Trotskyism today, saying, "Our party comrades have not noticed that Trotskyism has long ceased to be a political trend among the working class. They do not know that Trotskyism has changed from a political trend of the working class seven or eight years ago into a crazy and unprincipled sabotage, subversion, espionage, and assassination of party members, acting on the orders of foreign intelligence agencies. Today's Trotskyists dare not reveal their true faces to the working class, dare not reveal their true goals and tasks. They try to keep the working class ignorant of their political faces, fearing that the working class, after discovering their true intentions, will denounce them as enemies of the people and drive them out." Regarding this point, Stalin reiterated the Trotskyist program revealed in the case of the anti-Soviet Trotskyist center, which was to restore capitalism, abolish collective and state-owned farms, restore the exploitation system, unite with the fascist forces of Germany and Japan, launch a war against the Soviet Union, support the war, oppose the peace policy, divide the Soviet Union's territory, cede Ukraine to Germany, and the coastal provinces to Japan. They prepared to defeat the Soviet Union when it was attacked by the enemy. To achieve this goal, they launched sabotage and subversive activities, carried out personal terror against the leaders of the Soviet regime, and acted as spies for the German and Japanese fascist forces. All of this is the Trotskyist program of today, as revealed by Pyatakov, Radek, and Sokolnikov.</p>
<p>Stalin asked, "Why have we not paid attention to all of the above? Why have we completely forgotten it? The reason is that in recent years, our party comrades have focused all their efforts on economic work and have been obsessed with economic success. Because they are obsessed with economic success, they have forgotten everything else. Because they are obsessed with economic success, they have begun to think that this is everything, and as a result, they have not paid attention to the Soviet Union's international situation, its capitalist environment, the intensification of the party's political work, and the tasks of fighting against sabotage activities. They assume that the importance of such issues is second-rate, or even third-rate."</p>
<p>Stalin particularly severely criticized the tendency to be complacent and arrogant, to underestimate the enemy's strength and overestimate one's own strength, and the result of this political blindness when great and important successes are being achieved in socialist construction.</p>
<p>Stalin pointed out the methods for clearing out these shortcomings, saying, "First, we must turn the attention of our party comrades, who are obsessed with the routine of various departments, to important political issues of international and domestic nature. We must raise the party's political work to the proper height, starting with political education and the Bolshevik training of party affairs, Soviet, and economic cadres as the basis."</p>
<p>"We must shatter and discard the following bad theory: that if we move forward a step, the class struggle in our country will become more silent; the more successful we are, the more docile our class enemies will be. On the contrary, the more we advance, the more successful we are, the more angry the shattered exploiting classes will become. They will more quickly adopt more acute forms of struggle and will be more disruptive to the Soviet regime, using more desperate means of struggle as a last resort. We must shatter and discard the following bad theory: that Trotskyist saboteurs have no reserves and have exhausted their last cadres. Trotskyists do have their reserves, first of all, the remnants of the shattered exploiting classes in the Soviet Union, as well as various groups and organizations abroad that are hostile to the Soviet Union, such as the Trotskyist counter-revolutionary Fourth International, two-thirds of whom are spies and subversives; and the gang of thieves in Norway, such as Chevrov, who protected the super-spy Trotsky himself and helped him disrupt the Soviet Union; and the group of Sulvarin in France, and the large number of gentlemen in Germany, such as Rose, Fish, Maslov, and Upensky, who sell their bodies and souls to the fascists. Can these people not provide reserves for Trotskyist espionage and sabotage work? And all the literary gangsters in the United States, led by the famous thief Eastman, who specialize in attacking the Soviet working class for a living, can these people not provide reinforcements for Trotskyism? This bad theory that Trotskyists have exhausted their cadres cannot be established and must be discarded immediately."</p>
<p>Stalin finally suggested implementing the entire method system of leading party affairs cadres and promoting new leading staff. He concluded by saying, "We will now further enumerate the necessary basic measures to clear out the subversive, destructive, espionage, and terrorist activities of the Trotskyist fascist secret agents of foreign intelligence agencies, making them harmless. We possess all the necessary means to realize these measures." (TASS dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<h3>Tensions Between the German Church and the National Socialist Party Are Increasing</h3>
<p>Various Bishops Publicly Declare Resistance, Denouncing it as Sabotaging the Concordat</p>
<p>[Berlin] Catholics and Christians in Germany reaffirmed their religious beliefs and resisted the National Socialist Party on Easter. Yesterday, Sunday, the Catholic Bishop of Berlin, Blessing, read a statement denouncing the National Socialist Party for sabotaging the concordat, and asked students and parents to protest to the authorities and prevent the National Socialist Party from succeeding in its plot to destroy church schools. It is reported that the bishop openly ordered Berlin Catholics to resist the National Socialist Party, which is the first time since the outbreak of the conflict. Crowds gathered outside the church and cheered the bishop, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The same scene occurred in the Catholic Church in Munich on the same day. Archbishop Faulhaber, chairman, and Munich Bishop Lindau gave speeches, saying that the Catholic Church must continue to fight, even if it means sacrificing their lives. The Easter announcement that the Evangelical Church had planned to distribute, which informed the clergy of what should be done in the Easter prayer meeting, has been confiscated by the police. German Orthodox Pastor Niemöller read out the names of the clergy who were still being detained or expelled from the church in the Dahlen Church, and asked the crowds to pray for these oppressed people. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 29th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Today is Easter. Judging from the situation in which religious ceremonies were held in churches throughout the country, it can be seen that the relationship between the National Socialist Party authorities and various churches such as the Catholic and Christian churches is still quite tense. When the grand mass ceremony was held at the St. Hedwig's Cathedral here, the Bishop of Berlin, Blessing, made a statement regarding the prohibition of the establishment of schools by the Catholic Church by the National Socialist Party authorities, and cited the papal encyclical issued the other day, saying that this move by the National Socialist government was a violation of the ecclesiastical agreement signed between the Vatican and Germany. Although the papal encyclical was very persuasive, the German government ignored it and still refused the church's right to participate in the education of believers' children. This situation is very serious and worrying. Believers who are fathers and brothers must submit written protests to the National Socialist Party authorities. Blessing continued to mention the education system in the Saar region, saying, "The Archbishop of Saarbrücken has repeatedly negotiated with the authorities orally and in writing, but all protests from the Catholic Church have been ignored by the authorities and have not been answered. The fairness solemnly guaranteed by the Vatican and Germany has now been completely destroyed. This cannot be explained from the standpoint of either Christians or German nationals. "In addition, Cardinal Faulhaber also declared at the Easter Mass held in the Cathedral of the Monk City that the Catholic Church would never give up its struggle to uphold Christian doctrine. As for the Christian Church, Pastor Niemöller of the Protestant Church read out to the public today the list of Jesus pastors and believers who are currently being held in detention camps, and asked all believers not to forget to pray for them when they hold prayers. In addition, the Protestant Church had a bulletin printed, which was originally intended to be published on Easter, but was suddenly searched and confiscated by the police today, so it did not come to fruition. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 28th)</p>
<p>⊙ Vatican City: The Easter Mass was held in St. Peter's Basilica this morning, and Pope Pius XI personally participated and blessed the believers. It is reported that the Pope suffered from severe gout and was on the verge of danger. He has recently recovered, but his body has not completely recovered, and he is already eighty years old, so he cannot bear the effort. Therefore, after returning to the palace from the church this morning, he rested in bed and did not get up all day. The imperial doctor examined him in the afternoon, but other than an increase in asthma compared to before, his general health was still quite good. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Pope Pius XI of Rome attended the Easter Mass in St. Peter's Basilica today, and the number of people who attended the church was extremely large, which is rare in the past. This was the first time the Pope participated in a public grand ceremony after his illness. The Pope sat upright in his seat and retired after the ceremony was completed. After the Mass, the Pope gave a blessing to the crowd, and more than 150,000 people participated. The vast square in front of St. Peter's Basilica was crowded with people, and there was almost no space left. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 28th)</p>

(Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] It has been a year since Germany built fortifications in the Rhineland. It has been rumored that leader Hitler has visited the area. The Prime Minister's Office recently announced that it has no knowledge of this matter. It is reported that Hitler always keeps his visits secret in advance and only announces them at the time of departure. It is not known whether this trip to the Rhineland will be announced at the last minute. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>France's Economic Recovery is Becoming Increasingly Significant</h3>

<p>⊙ Belfast: Disturbances have occurred every year on Easter Sunday since the 1916 riots. This year, in various parts of Northern Ireland, the Republicans attempted to hold demonstrations and clashed with the police. The situation in Belfast was particularly serious, with more than 20 people seriously injured. The police finally used batons to disperse the crowd. About 800 Republicans, including women and children, wanted to go to the graves of the martyrs who died in the Easter uprising. The police immediately stopped them and tightly guarded the surroundings of the grave. The crowd knelt in the streets and requested that the crowd leaders want to make speeches, and the police immediately arrested them. The crowd then attacked the police with stones. After the police reinforcements arrived, order was restored. Since then, armored vehicles have been patrolling the streets all day long, and various gatherings have been banned.

<h3>Indian Political Turmoil</h3>
<p>Muslim Leaders Also Oppose the Government</p>
<p>⊙ Bombay: Sir Teslavi, leader of the Muslim group in the Provincial Assembly, has today expressed his refusal to Bombay Governor Brabourne's invitation to form a cabinet in the province, thereby further deepening the Indian political turmoil. Previously, Governor Brabourne had invited the leader of the People's Party, Colonel Kerr, to form a cabinet in the province, but he also failed because he was unwilling to allow the exemption of emergency powers under the 1935 Constitution. The same deadlock has occurred in the provinces of Nasir and the Central Provinces. Nehru, the leader of the left wing of the People's Party, is now opposing the leader of the anti-revival, resolutely refusing to compromise with the authorities, and saying, "The sham of civil rule under the false constitution has been torn apart, and the hideous face that makes people hate it has been completely revealed." It is said that Gandhi has also abandoned his original advocacy of peace and is quite satisfied with the current rapidly changing situation. As for the crux of this political turmoil, it lies in the veto power granted to the governors of each province by the anti-Liu constitution of the progressive elements in India. This veto power allows the governors to take unilateral actions regardless of the will of the provincial cabinet. (National Telegraph on the 29th)</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Comment on Naval Issues</h3>
<p>Hope Naval Countries Sign New Treaty</p>
<p>[New York] The New York Public Opinion Forum Newspaper published an article by the famous reporter Warner, commenting on naval issues, stating briefly, "The 1930 London Naval Treaty expired at the end of last year, and the United States is no longer bound by it. However, the government authorities are now hoping that a new treaty can be established between the naval countries to limit naval armaments. To this end, the Navy Department has obtained the consent of the White House to temporarily abide by the quantitative restrictions contained in the 1930 London Naval Treaty. The construction of ten cruisers originally planned will be temporarily postponed. That is, the naval budget bill proposed by the Navy Department will not be submitted to Congress for discussion at this time. Official sources also hope that countries around the world will conduct negotiations in the next 12 to 18 months in order to stabilize the world's armaments situation, as well as the political and economic situation. The United States seems to hope that Britain will take the lead in initiating this negotiation, and the United States will naturally be happy to support it in order to promote its success."

<h3>Japan Refuses to Limit Gun Positions</h3>
<p>British Newspaper Publishes Commentary</p>
<p>[London] The Daily Telegraph published an editorial today, speaking of the serious consequences of Japan's refusal of Britain's invitation to comply with the 14-inch large-caliber cannon limit, saying that in addition to the British battleships currently under construction, the caliber of the cannons can be increased to 16 inches, and sooner or later there will be a country whose battleship tonnage will exceed the limit of 35,000 tons per ship. The danger of competition between cannon caliber and hull tonnage is regrettable. Over time, the cost of building battleships will double and be unlimited. No country will gain anything from this. Ultimately, the relative position of the competing countries is almost the same as when the competition first started, but none of the countries is not poorer. What kind of benefits does Japan want to gain by comparing its power with a wealthy and powerful naval country such as the United States? It is difficult to guess. Not recognizing the treaty's restrictions is perhaps an expression of prestige, but the world's actual restrictions still exist. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 29th)</p>

<h3>The Next Great War Will Be Decided by the Air Force</h3>
<p>British Government Plans to Move the Capital to Scotland</p>
<p>[London] It was learned today that Britain has made advance preparations to move government agencies from London to a secret location on the Scottish border in times of crisis, because experts believe that the next war will be an air war, so this preparation has been made. Canadian Prime Minister King stated in the Canadian House of Commons that if another war breaks out in Europe, Britain does not intend to send troops to the European continent. This point has also been confirmed by the Navy Department. It is reported that if Britain intervenes in European wars in the future, the air force will be dispatched to attack the enemy's airfields to prevent the enemy's bombers from leaving the ground. Britain is most concerned about not allowing enemy countries to occupy airfields in the Netherlands and Belgium and attack Britain. However, most experts believe that even if a war breaks out, it will be at least five years later. (National Telegraph on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebels Uncover Treasonous Plot</h3>
<p>The culprit is a German spy; 30 officers were killed; the rebels ban Charlie Chaplin films.</p>
<p>[London] The diplomatic correspondent of the Manchester Guardian recently announced that a conspiracy has been brewing in the Nationalist-controlled area of southern Spain, particularly around the port of Malaga. A large number of officers under General Franco were involved. The aim of the conspiracy was to release all the prisoners held by the Nationalists and to launch an uprising in the rear to harass the Nationalist army. The matter was discovered by German intelligence, and the Nationalist government preemptively carried out arrests and executions, particularly strictly in the city of Malaga. At least eighteen leaders of the conspiracy have been killed. It is reported that the German intelligence agency that discovered this conspiracy had already infiltrated Spain and was actively operating in the country long before the outbreak of the Spanish civil war. (Central News Agency, Havana, 29th)</p>

<p>⊙ Bayonne: The Spanish ship "Malgas Bibo" loaded 2,000 tons of coal from Newcastle, England, and was transporting it to the Pugo ironworks in France. Today at 2:30 AM, when it arrived off Cape Breton in the Landes department of southern France, it was suddenly attacked by two Spanish Nationalist gunboats within French territorial waters. They fired a total of fifteen shots, hitting the ship's hull at the waterline. The ship then ran aground near the north breakwater of the Adour River estuary. One of the Spanish Nationalist gunboats, named "Galena," continued to strafe with machine guns. However, out of the thirty-four crew members of the "Malgas Bibo," only two sailors suffered minor injuries due to a steam pipe explosion on the ship; the rest were unharmed. Although the ship is aground, there is widespread concern that it cannot be towed out, and there is a risk that it will sink completely when the tide rises tonight. Moreover, when the gunboat opened fire, the sound of gunfire was clearly heard here. (Central News Agency, Havas, 29th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Auto Industry Labor Negotiations Proceed Smoothly</h3>
<p>Right-wing union opposes strike</p>
<p>⊙ Lansing: Lewis, chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization, has gone to New York today. Before leaving, he instructed his deputy to continue negotiations to resolve the strike situation at Chrysler Corporation plants in the Detroit area. Michigan Governor Murphy also believes that a solution is not far off. Lewis and Martin, president of the United Automobile Workers of America, did not criticize the statement made by William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, in Washington, which said that "sit-down strikes" are illegal actions. (National News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>⊙ Lansing: Negotiations to resolve the Chrysler auto company strike continued today, the fifth day of negotiations. Michigan Governor Murphy said at today's meeting that the only issue that has not yet been agreed upon regarding the auto union's request for absolute bargaining rights is the wording. Lewis, chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization, who was originally the labor leader in these negotiations, has gone to New York to attend the wage meeting of the Miners' Union, as Lewis is also the president of the Miners' Union. However, the auto industry meeting will continue tomorrow, undeterred by Lewis's absence. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>⊙ Lansing: Regarding the Chrysler auto plant strike, negotiations are currently being conducted by representatives of the factory and labor, namely Lewis, chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization. Secretary of Labor Perkins said that an agreement could be reached today, but so far, the two sides have not yet agreed on a solution and will continue talks tomorrow. Lewis has gone to New York and has entrusted his assistant to preside over the negotiations on his behalf. (Central News Agency, Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>[Washington] William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, announced for the first time today that the union opposes "sit-down strikes," saying that such strikes hinder the interests of workers, so the union does not support them. The union's reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ The public opposes sit-down strikes, so workers will lose public support.</p>
<p>㊁ Sit-down strikes may be temporarily successful, but because the public cannot permanently tolerate the illegal occupation of other people's property, they will ultimately be detrimental to the labor movement.</p>
<p>㊂ If such methods continue to be used, they will inevitably lead Congress to enact laws such as compulsory arbitration to suppress unions.</p>
<p>Therefore, Green opposes sit-down strikes both in his capacity as president of the American Federation of Labor and in his personal capacity. (National News Agency, 28th)</p>

<h3>Further Report on Smuggling Incident in Cang County</h3>
<p>Two dead and one wounded among smuggling rōnin; the militia seized guns, bullets, and smuggled sugar.</p>
<p>Regarding the clash between the militia of Jiuzhou, Cang County, and Korean smugglers while carrying out anti-smuggling duties, we reported yesterday via our Tianjin correspondent. We have now received a further communication from Cang County, along with photographs of the case, which we will report as follows:</p>
<p>On the 11th of this month, two militiamen stationed in Jiuzhou went to the North Gate area and saw two cars full of smuggled goods speeding east. They went forward to investigate, but unexpectedly, the private security team within the cars suddenly opened fire. The militiamen quickly took cover in a roadside ditch. Then, four or five people in the rear car fired their guns left and right. The front car also fired multiple shots backward and drove away. At this time, bullets rained down. The front car suddenly stopped by the roadside, and the militiamen went forward to check and found that the Korean driver, Li Zhongyu, had died from a stray bullet. Park Heung-bok and Kim Young-chan were also wounded in the legs. Wook Kim Young-chan also died. Inside the car, they seized a No. 2 Browning pistol, sixteen bullets, four spent bullet casings, nine pistol bullet casings, a car, and twenty-eight packages of smuggled sugar. They reported to the county and then to the provincial government for legal inspection and photography. The county government also arrested the militia involved in the incident for strict interrogation. At the same time, the injured Park Heung-bok was sent to an American hospital for treatment. On the 13th, Onozaki Fumima, the judicial director of the police station of the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin, along with many Japanese and Koreans, went to Cang County to investigate. The provincial government also sent Councilor Chen Qingyun to investigate the truth. The bodies have now been transported back, and the injured person has recovered and been discharged from the hospital. However, members of society believe that smuggling has been rampant in recent years, hindering customs duties and local security. They all hope that the authorities will seriously negotiate to eliminate the source of the problem. Otherwise, rōnin protection teams will act arbitrarily, which will not only cause trouble in the area but also hinder friendly relations in the future.</p>

<h3>Effectiveness of Shantou Public Smuggling Prevention</h3>
<p>Anti-smuggling associations are all over counties, cities, towns, and villages; unscrupulous merchants have surrendered and started paying taxes.</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondent: Since last autumn, the government has intensified its efforts to combat smuggling, transferring 1,000 armed anti-smuggling personnel, distributed across coastal counties of Chaozhou region. Key points on land and water have been set up as checkpoints, and three warships have been dispatched, anchored off Nan'ao, Raoping, and Chaoyang seas. Chaozhou Customs has also increased the number of investigators to jointly combat smuggling. Various merchant guilds, trade unions, and others have voluntarily organized anti-smuggling associations, assisting the government's insufficient manpower, automatically cutting ties with unscrupulous merchants, refraining from smuggling goods, and establishing regulations, signing five-shop, five-person joint guarantee methods, supervising each other, and severely punishing harmful elements. Unscrupulous merchants have suffered severe blows, with goods piled up like mountains, unable to move, unable to be received, and unable to be sold. Among them, various secret organizations have automatically disintegrated and disappeared, and have ended themselves one after another. Some have suffered excessive losses and are unable to stop, leading to internal strife. Some insist on their superior position, always being special and unwilling to pay taxes. Some advocate negotiating with our side, without considering the friendly relations between the two countries. Some advocate temporarily holding out, waiting for the opportunity to come and reorganize. Some voluntarily surrender, report taxes to the special tax bureau, and maintain commercial ethics. Currently, the business of special foreign firms in Shantou City has all stopped. The largest joint-stock company, since tens of thousands of pieces of soybean and soybean cake were shipped in mid-January, no second batch has been seen. The soybeans are stored in the Wuqiao warehouse, and those near the damp ground have gradually become moldy. When soybean cakes are in high demand during the Qingming Festival, it is also impossible for the soybean cakes in the warehouse to be sprinkled into the fields. Unscrupulous merchants painfully feel that all their capital will be lost, and what they have been engaged in for years has already suffered huge losses, so they secretly sell them at low prices and automatically report taxes to the agricultural special tax bureau, obtain shipping permits according to legal procedures, and hand them over to willing buyers. Compared with the armed escort and overweening ambition of the past, there is a world of difference. It can be seen that strict smuggling prevention can indeed achieve remarkable results. Since the anti-smuggling organization in Chaozhou and Shantou has been effective, the provincial government specially issued an order yesterday to all counties in the province to follow the anti-smuggling regulations of the Shantou silk and cloth industry and automatically organize themselves in various market towns to put smuggling to death. Moreover, within Shantou City, thirty-eight trade associations have formed anti-smuggling associations. Because the nature of each business is different, the regulations are also different. Seven transport unions have automatically organized seven anti-smuggling associations. Each anti-smuggling association sends personnel to various market towns in the interior to organize anti-smuggling branches, quickly connecting to Shantou. Because the branch associations in each county and industry are being organized, the Chaozhou-Meizhou Federation of Industry and Commerce Anti-Smuggling Association is set up in Shantou City. This month can be established. The composition of the association, horizontally, has more than 50 industrial and commercial groups, and vertically, with each industry as the foundation, has branch associations of counties, cities, towns, districts, and villages. The Joint Anti-Smuggling Association also adopts a close liaison posture with military, political, and party anti-smuggling agencies. This is a good phenomenon of the people of Chaozhou and Meizhou uniting to assist the government. At present, the tax revenue of Guangdong Province and Chaozhou Customs has increased more than doubled compared to the same period last year. The monthly income of the Shantou Agricultural Tax Bureau has reached 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. Special smugglers have disappeared. However, those who smuggle drugs, saccharin, and other prohibited items by steamer, and those who buy copper coins, tungsten ore, and metal exports are still being cracked down on daily. The government executes these people with extreme punishment, without showing tolerance. During the Lunar New Year, more than 100 suspects were arrested in Shantou, and not one was released. Those listed on the smuggling activity roster in each county, once arrested, are waiting to be offered up. Very few slip through the net. Unscrupulous merchants are terrified, and those who have dealings with rōnin often automatically take refuge in other ports. Therefore, a solemn atmosphere now prevails everywhere.</p>
<h3>Recent Four Battles of the Northeast Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Japanese troops stationed in Sanxing were suddenly attacked; volunteer armies are also active in Shenyang and Changchun</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Daily's Harbin dispatch on March 20th reported that earlier this month, the military authorities released a report on the activities of anti-Japanese elements, stating that the number of attacks in the past twelve months had decreased. However, as the weather warms up, their activities will certainly be more severe than before in order to obtain a safe place. However, the bustling commercial town of Sanxing, near the Songhua River, where no less than 500 Japanese troops are stationed, was suddenly attacked by 400 anti-Japanese elements, which was beyond the expectations of the authorities. These men were very careful in their deployment. Their sudden arrival caught the Japanese garrison and police off guard. Several local Japanese residents fled in panic to the Japanese military camp, but before reaching the camp, several people were seized by the bandits and held for ransom. When the attackers arrived in the town, they engaged in street battles with the police, killing one Japanese police chief. The number of police dead and wounded is unknown. The attackers preemptively occupied strong points and set up obstacles on the road, so they began to rob Japanese stores and set houses on fire. When the army arrived on the scene, key points had been equipped with machine guns, making it very difficult to approach the enemy. The attacking army's weapons were very sophisticated, and they fought extremely bravely, so the regular army was only able to force the enemy to retreat after dozens of hours of fighting. As for the casualties, because the authorities had issued strict orders not to disclose anything, news about this battle could not be ascertained. However, a total of 1,000 people participated in the battle, and both sides used machine guns to fire at each other, so it is expected that there were many dead and wounded. While the fighting in Sanxing was going on, news came from Shenyang that a small team of soldiers fought with about seventy anti-Japanese elements in a forest about eighty miles northeast of Shenyang. The enemy was well-equipped and fought bravely for several hours. In this battle, one Japanese soldier was killed and six were wounded. It is not known whether there were any dead or wounded among the enemy. Also, a Japanese detachment fought with the anti-Japanese army near Huaniupu (transliteration) on the Changchun-Tumen railway line. According to official documents, the battle was very fierce because the enemy army had machine guns. Seven Japanese soldiers were wounded, two of whom are unlikely to survive due to their serious injuries. Twenty enemy soldiers were killed. Also, according to a reporter for the Japanese Nichinichi Shimbun in Qiqihar, an anti-Japanese volunteer army fought fiercely with the police near Qiqihar, killing and wounding twenty-seven police officers.</p>

One of them, Li Shouchang, also known as Ding Xiangsheng, was offered a reward of 500 yuan by the provincial government for his arrest. He has been on the run for a long time without being captured. Now he secretly returned to his home in Liuqiao. The county police station learned of this, sent police to arrest him. Li heard the news and fled southeast. Director Chen telegraphed the police in Fangtai, Malu, and Nanmen to encircle and arrest him. He was arrested at the Yajing Temple and brought to the station for interrogation. He confessed that he was 29 years old and did not deny participating in the major riot in previous years, but after being wanted, he first went to the Northeast, then to Tianjin, and recently to Henan, where he worked peacefully and did nothing illegal. According to Director Chen's confession, he is investigating his recent activities. If he has truly repented, he will be given a chance to start anew.</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>March 27th</p>
<p>Addressed to the Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper Office</p>
<p>Enclosed: Letter to General Ma Zhanshan</p>
<p>To the Esteemed General:</p>
<p>Regarding the case accepted by this office, involving Cheng Jinbo and others accusing Li Haohua and others of embezzling donations intended to support General Ma Zhanshan, Cheng Jinbo and others have stated that, last year, the soldiers in Suiyuan were bravely defending the territory against the enemy, and local people, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, initiated a donation drive to support Suiyuan. Local people, understanding the greater good, readily opened their purses. Many mentioned that after the Mukden Incident, an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement was organized in Hefei. At that time, 8,000 yuan was raised in cash. Li Haohua and other committee members of the movement withdrew 7,000 yuan from a money house and remitted it to General Ma Zhanshan's office in Hailun. However, General Ma withdrew from Hailun, so no one received the funds, and the post office returned it to its origin, whereupon Li Haohua and others embezzled it for themselves. They also emphasized that while the Suiyuan donation receipt was issued, it was necessary to carefully handle the matter to ensure that the funds reached the soldiers at the front and were not embezzled by private individuals again. The complainants, facing public condemnation, had no choice but to request a thorough investigation to clarify the truth and falsehoods for the public, so that the future of the patriotic movement would not be hindered.</p>
<p>The accused, Li Haohua and others, argued that they did withdraw 7,000 yuan in cash from the money house and remitted it to General Ma Zhanshan's office in Hailun on December 28th of the Republic year 20 and received a reply telegram from General Ma on January 7th of the Republic year 21: "To the Hefei Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement: Received and acknowledged your telegram. Deeply grateful for the generous donation. I have instructed my subordinates to go to Harbin to arrange for transfer. [Signed] Ma Zhanshan.” However, they continued, the National Salvation Movement has been reorganized several times. The complainants left Hefei one after another due to employment issues. Although the remittance slips and related documents are untraceable for verification, it would not be difficult to directly request them from General Ma to prove that no embezzlement occurred.</p>
<p>Because this case is attracting public attention and is of great importance to the future of the patriotic movement, this office is handling it with special care. We have long admired your dedication to resisting the enemy and saving the nation. We trust you will not be deterred by the tediousness and will quickly instruct the personnel who handled the remittance of donations at that time to investigate whether the Hefei National Salvation Movement remitted 7,000 yuan in the winter of the Republic year 20, or if only a remittance telegram was received and the original funds were returned. Also, please confirm if the aforementioned reply telegram exists. Please reply with a letter to facilitate the handling of this matter. Your assistance would be deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Tan Xinzhen, Chief Prosecutor</p>
<p>Addressed to General Ma Zhanshan</p>

<h3>The Tianjin Team's Well-Organized Play Leads to Another Victory Over the Military Combined Team</h3>
<p>Score of 5-1, the Military Team's Defense Proves Weak; Jiang Lu Scores Four Goals; Tianjin Team Returns North Last Night</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Tianjin Interport Football Team defeated the Military Combined Team represented by Lau Er by a score of 5-1. Jiang Lu, the only Chinese player on the field, scored four goals, earning enthusiastic praise from the 3,000 to 4,000 spectators at the Recreation Ground. This trip began with an 8-3 victory over the Shanghai Interport Team, followed by a 2-2 draw with the Shanghai Chinese Team. Yesterday's match was their last two games. That night, they boarded the Shanghai-Beijing train for a triumphant return north. This winning record has created a very positive impression among Shanghai football fans.</p>
<p>The Tianjin Team is Well-Organized</p>
<p>The Tianjin Interport Team has a well-organized and responsive system, and their agile forward line has contributed to their glorious victories. Although the military team launched fierce attacks in yesterday's match, they could not penetrate the penalty area and had few opportunities to shoot. Even when they did, they were unlucky, and their shots went wide. Furthermore, their inner defense was weak, and the goalkeeper seemed non-existent. When the opposing team approached, trouble quickly ensued. The score of 5-1 was the natural result. Without the penalty kick in the first half, they would have undoubtedly been shut out.</p>
<p>First Half Score: 2-0</p>
<p>The military team kicked off first and showed great momentum. However, the Tianjin team soon took the initiative and displayed their prowess. Huo Wei initially missed an attempt at the goal, trying again and again without success. Jones's header hit the goalpost and bounced back. The situation was intense, and the military team struggled to defend. Eventually, Jiang Lu received a pass from Jones and scored the first goal. The military team launched fierce counterattacks, their momentum surging, and they came within inches of scoring several times. Three minutes before the end of the first half, Jie Hanzhen scored another goal, making the score 2-0.</p>
<p>Military Team Awarded a Penalty Kick</p>
<p>Five minutes into the second half, the military team's midfielder inadvertently let Turner slip through and pass the ball in front of the goal. Jiang Lu rushed to take advantage of the empty space and calmly kicked the ball in. Shortly after, Huo Wei scored again, but it was disallowed due to offsides. The military team's forwards repeatedly attacked the opposing team's camp, but they were unable to penetrate the strong fortress. During one play, Tule sprinted with the ball, and when Bao Jinhan saw the situation was unfavorable, he pushed him hard, resulting in a penalty kick. The military team finally broke their goose egg, and Shabosi followed up to make the score 3-1.</p>
<p>Jiang Lu Scores Two More Goals</p>
<p>The military team continued to pressure, and military players were frequently seen in front of the Tianjin team's goal. The Tianjin team's defenders worked together to maintain an impenetrable defense. However, the military team's defense was lax, and when the visiting team occasionally broke through, they were caught off guard. The goalkeeper's clumsiness was particularly disappointing. Jiang Lu once made a long pass that hit the corner of the goal, revealing the goalkeeper's weakness. After that, although the military team's attacks were more intense than the Tianjin team's, they ultimately had no opportunities to shoot. At 35 minutes, Jiang Lu received a pass from Huo Wei and scored again, making the final score 5-1. The lineups for both teams were as follows:</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Games News</h3>
<p>Preparatory Committee to Begin Organization</p>
<p>The Seventh National Games will be held in the capital on the Double Tenth Festival this year.

<p>▲0-1</p>

Due to the selection of various players for the Eastern Association to stay in the province and not participate, the strength of Chinese United was greatly reduced. In the first half, the opposing team's attack was extremely fierce, and Chinese United struggled to maintain a clean sheet for thirty minutes before finally conceding a goal. In the second half, both sides had their share of attacks and defenses. After twenty-two minutes, Liang Baiwei of Chinese United committed a foul and conceded another free kick, resulting in a 0-2 defeat.

<h3>A General Overview of Education in Northeast and Eastern Hebei Under Japanese Cultural Aggression</h3>
<p>Controlling Education in the Northeast to Eliminate Revolutionary Thought; Private Schools Increase in Eastern Hebei, Puppet Government to Implement Suppression</p>
<p>In recent years, Japan's cultural aggression against China has become even more aggressive. The most convenient regions for implementation are Northeast China and Eastern Hebei. A summary of the anesthesia education situation in each region is provided below:</p>
<p>(Harbin Correspondence) The Education Department of the puppet Binjiang Provincial Government, in accordance with the principles of Japanese puppet control of education, has unified the secondary and higher education schools in the puppet province and placed them under the direct management of the province to facilitate the implementation of Japanese puppet slave education. All 39 schools have now been taken over. Other training institutes and Sino-Russian and Japanese schools are not included. The puppet education department is currently very busy. In addition, the puppet Ministry of Education has ordered that after all county secondary and higher education schools are transferred to provincial management, the original budget will be used specifically for primary education to consolidate the foundation of Japanese puppet anesthesia education. (Fushun Correspondence) The Fushun puppet county government, following the puppet Ministry of Education's order, held a Japanese puppet art exhibition to commemorate the visit to Japan, with the aim of increasing Japanese puppet friendship. Japanese puppet celebrities stationed in the Northeast, regardless of whether they specialize in Eastern painting, Western painting, or sculpture, are widely solicited to review and display their works to promote the inseparable relationship between Japanese puppet culture. (Another report) The Confucius Society, run by pro-Japanese traitors in the county, is now actively promoting the study of classics, thoroughly publicizing the Japanese puppet royal road doctrine. It has established a classics research class, backed by the Japanese, forcing young male and female students over the age of 18 in schools to enroll.</p>
<p>(Yushu Correspondence) The puppet county magistrate of Yushu County, Xiong Xiyao, in order to secure his position, is shamelessly pandering to Japan. In particular, he has been working hard to promote slave education. He has now purchased a large number of various types of anesthesia primary school textbooks to donate to students in various primary schools, and even private schools receive them. The puppet county magistrate specifically ordered each puppet school principal to distribute the books according to the students' levels, and also ordered each puppet administration director to thoroughly replace the miscellaneous books used in private schools, which inevitably contain revolutionary ideas, with the Japanese puppet state designated textbooks to implement the educational spirit of Japanese puppet friendship, ordering the puppet administration directors to instruct their subordinate puppet township heads to refer to and strictly comply with the book distribution method, and to be supervised by the puppet administration directors to ensure universal distribution.</p>
<p>(Tangshan Correspondence) Tangshan is an important town in eastern Hebei, densely populated, with a population of over 100,000. The number of children who should receive primary education is no less than 10,000, but there are only about a dozen primary schools, including the Kailuan four schools, Pei Ren Shude Er attached primary school, Fengrun County No. 1 and No. 2 primary school, National No. 1 and No. 2 primary school, and Tongren primary school, and Rotary primary school. In addition, several short-term primary schools were established last year by the public education center. The total number of enrolled children is less than 5,000, and more than half of the children are out of school. Due to objective environmental needs, many people take the opportunity to open private schools or tutoring schools. According to a survey by the puppet police bureau, there were a total of over 60 private schools last autumn, with about 1,000 children attending private schools. Since the beginning of this spring, private schools and tutoring schools have emerged in response to the situation. According to a survey by the puppet authorities, 36 new private schools have been established, bringing the total to over 100, many of which inevitably promote revolutionary ideas against the puppet government under the guise of running a school, and suppression is now being planned.

<h3>Japanese Medical Doctor Yoshie Arrested for Forging Certificates to Deceive Our Chinese Students</h3>
<p>University Graduation Certificates Cost a Hundred Yuan; Tokyo's Major Newspapers Consider It Unusual</p>
<p>The major newspapers in Tokyo, Japan, published strange news with large headlines in their morning and evening editions of March 20th and the March 21st Japanese publication, namely, that Dr. Yoshie, a professor at the Japanese Medical University, was arrested by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department for the buying and selling of graduation certificates between him and a Chinese student surnamed Yang. Prior to the discovery of this incident, Yang was suspected of shoplifting in a bookstore and was reported to the police. At that time, Yang's Japanese Medical University graduation certificate and a research certificate from a certain doctor in the Department of Otolaryngology of the University Hospital were discovered. However, Yang had only arrived in Japan in November of last year, and his command of the language was still poor. How could he have such a certificate? Due to strong suspicions, he was interrogated closely, and it was discovered that the false graduation certificate was made by Dr. Yoshie Yoshiwo, a professor in the Department of Otolaryngology at the Japanese Medical University and the head of the otolaryngology department of the affiliated hospital. The intermediary was a Japanese man named Furubayashi Kenshu, who resided in the Hongo District and made a living by fortune telling. First, Yang gave Furubayashi 100 yuan, and Furubayashi gave Yoshie 20 yuan. Later, Yang visited Yoshie from time to time and gave him another 100 yuan to obtain the aforementioned false graduation certificate. The police department has now arrested both Furubayashi and Yoshie on bribery charges and is conducting a detailed investigation. The case may be transferred to the court. This reporter believes that this incident will have a significant impact on the future of our students studying abroad, and I went to the police department to inquire about the news. According to sources, the police department discovered that many Chinese students studying in Japan had forged and used false domestic graduation certificates in the country in April of the previous year. At that time, as many as 30 people were reported. Later, our Supervisory Office realized that students' violations of the law abroad were detrimental to the national image and specifically joined forces with various schools to strictly crack down on them. The police department did not want the situation to worsen and stepped up its investigation. Most unscrupulous students did not dare to try again. However, the previous false certificates were generally qualifications from our domestic schools. This time, a false graduation certificate from the Japanese Medical University was unexpectedly discovered. It is truly an unfortunate incident for the Japanese academic community that a doctor from the highest institution of learning, who possesses assets of 100,000 yuan, would commit such an illegal act. They very much hope that the country's reputation and the credibility of its academic community will be strengthened through further efforts to investigate and eradicate such imprudent behavior.

The revolutionary spirit of the martyrs is still deeply imprinted in our minds. If it were not for the struggles and sacrifices of the revolutionary martyrs in those years, the autocratic Qing regime would not have been overthrown so quickly, and the Republic of China would not have been established so quickly. If the Republic of China had not been established, our nation would not be striding so vigorously onto the glorious path of rejuvenation as it is today. Therefore, it is especially meaningful to commemorate the revolutionary martyrs today, when the entire country is unified and advancing in construction, cultural development is surging forward, and national spirit is soaring. First, the Guangzhou uprising on the twenty-ninth day of the third month of the Xinhai year occurred after Sun Yat-sen's ninth revolutionary failure. At that time, the revolutionaries were demoralized by the recent failure, and the Qing court's defenses were particularly strict. In such a harsh environment, the revolutionary martyrs disregarded everything and made a final struggle. More than two hundred people participated in this uprising. Although it still failed, most of the comrades were able to face death with courage and determination, preferring death to surrender. They never showed the slightest sign of submission or compromise. The martyrs numbered seventy-two, but there were actually dozens more whose names are unknown. This kind of courageous and fearless spirit is truly enough to move heaven and earth and make the gods weep. We, who are facing a formidable enemy today, should emulate them. Second, although this revolution failed, it pushed the revolutionary process forward a great deal, planting a very effective seed for the Wuchang Uprising. Sun Yat-sen once said, 'Gathering the elite of revolutionary parties from all provinces to make a final stand against the Manchus, even if the cause does not succeed, the heroic actions of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang have shaken the world, and the revolutionary situation in the country has been created by this.' Because the strike by the revolutionary martyrs awakened the hearts of the people throughout the country, increased the courage of the party members, and shifted the attention of the great powers, the easy success of the Xinhai Revolution was not without its roots in this. From this perspective, although the revolutionary martyrs shed blood and sacrificed themselves, this bloodshed and sacrifice was the price for the later success of the revolution. The founding history of the Republic of China was dyed with their red blood. Now that we understand the significance of commemorating the revolutionary martyrs, we should also have three points of understanding: ㊀ Why did the revolutionary martyrs have such a courageous and fearless spirit? Undoubtedly, it was because they had an accurate understanding and deep faith in the Three Principles of the People, and that the Republic of China should be built on the Three Principles of the People. Without the Three Principles of the People, there would be no Republic of China. Whether in space or time, there should absolutely not be two ideologies existing. We are willing to unite in spirit with those who believe in the Three Principles of the People and strive for the Three Principles of the People to resist foreign aggression. Otherwise, they are traitors to the Republic of China, and therefore traitors to the revolutionary martyrs. ㊁ The Republic of China is whole and indivisible. If anyone insists on creating disturbances and breaking the Republic of China, which the revolutionary martyrs exchanged for with their blood and sacrifice, whether they are foreign invaders or internal traitors, and regardless of what name or slogan they use, they will undermine the future of the Republic of China. It is important to know that whether the Chinese nation achieves liberation depends on strength as a prerequisite. The so-called strength naturally includes military power, financial power, and popular support. Every time there is a civil war, the national strength is weakened once. Weakening national strength is tantamount to suicide, which is tantamount to helping the enemy. Now China has completed a genuine peaceful unification. We can only guarantee this internal peaceful unification forever to be worthy of the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution. ㊂ The Three Principles of the People is centered on people's livelihood. Only by completing the economic construction of the Principle of People's Livelihood can the goal of the revolution be achieved. The reason why the revolutionary martyrs were unyielding and willing to sacrifice their lives was not just to overthrow the Manchu Qing government, but to go one step further and ensure that the 400 million people could all have their needs for clothing, housing, and transportation met. Therefore, on the one hand, we must ensure the integrity of territorial sovereignty, and on the other hand, we must enable the entire Chinese nation to share common welfare economically. Therefore, creating national capital and protecting private capital are the most important tasks at this stage. Even from the perspective of resisting foreign aggression, our independent economic construction is indispensable and cannot be delayed. Finally, I hope that from now on, everyone will continue the fighting spirit of the revolutionary martyrs and exchange the price of blood and flesh for the freedom and equality of the Chinese nation."</p>

<h3>Former Italian Finance Minister Stefani Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Visit Chiang Kai-shek in Hangzhou This Afternoon to Pay Respects. Will be Permanently Stationed in Nanjing for Office Work.</p>
<p>Former Italian Minister of Finance, Mr. Stefani, who has been hired as a consultant to the Chinese government, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (29th) at 1:30 PM aboard the Italian ship Victoria, accompanied by his wife, one son, two daughters, and secretary Magner, totaling six people. The ship docked at the China Merchants Bureau's north pier. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek sent Jiang Baili to welcome him. Mr. Stefani is scheduled to take the express train to Hangzhou at 1:40 PM this afternoon (30th) to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival Situation</p>
<p>The Victoria was originally scheduled to arrive at 2:30 PM yesterday, but arrived an hour early due to favorable winds. In addition to Jiang Baili, representing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, those who came to the port to welcome him included Xue Guangqian, representing the Executive Yuan, Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Tang Shixuan, Secretary, Zhang Mengling, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, the Italian Consul-General in Shanghai, Nilon, Italian military officers stationed in Shanghai, and dozens of people from Chinese and Italian circles. After the ship docked, the welcoming personnel boarded the ship to greet him. Mr. Stefani chatted with Mr. Jiang Baili for a long time and inquired about Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's well-being. Mr. Xue Guangqian then accompanied him to visit the construction of the city center and paid tribute to the Songhu war zone. He greatly praised China's various new constructions. The Italian Consul-General Nilon held a welcome banquet for him at 278 Hongqiao Road at 8:00 PM last night to welcome him. Chiang Baili and Xue Guangqian were invited to accompany him.</p>
<p>Departing for Hangzhou This Morning</p>
<p>Because of the fatigue of the journey, Mr. Stefani stayed on board the ship last night. He is scheduled to disembark this afternoon and take the 1:45 PM train to Hangzhou with his family and secretary to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek.

<p>According to Mr. Stefani's remarks to the Central News Agency reporter on the ship upon arriving in Shanghai, "I am sixty years old and have never been to China. I am very happy to be invited to China this time. My term of office here is four months, and I will set up an office in Nanjing, so I will be permanently stationed in the capital in the future. I will not stay in Shanghai for long and will go to Hangzhou to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Before I have met with Mr. Chiang, I am not comfortable making many remarks. Whether I will go to Southern and Northern China for inspection in the future must also wait until after I have met with Mr. Chiang." Mr. Stefani is a well-known financial expert, and his invitation to China will make a considerable contribution to China's financial administration.</p>
<h3>Chen Shaokuan Flies to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Meets with Kong to Discuss Departure Procedures. Will Go to Hangzhou Immediately to Bid Farewell to Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan, who has been appointed as the Deputy Envoy to attend the coronation ceremony of King George VI of England, has been busy with ministry affairs in Nanjing for several days and has now completed his work. He flew to Shanghai aboard a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane at 9:40 AM yesterday morning, arriving at Longhua Airport at 10:55 AM. He first went to the Huizhong Hotel on Nanjing Road to rest, then visited Special Envoy Kong, the Minister of Finance, to discuss departure procedures.

He is scheduled to inspect the Jiangnan Shipyard and the First Fleet Headquarters today and will also go to Hangzhou to bid farewell to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. On the second of next month, he will set off for abroad with Special Envoy Kong aboard the Italian mail ship Victoria.

During my absence, Deputy Minister Chen Jiliang will take over the ministry's affairs. Ma Dejian has been appointed as the director of the Jiangnan Shipyard. I have not been abroad for more than ten years. This time, after the British King's coronation ceremony, I will take the opportunity to inspect the construction of various countries. Britain is a world-renowned naval power, and other European countries have also been competing to improve their navies in recent years, making progress by leaps and bounds. Everything in our country is under construction, and I will use what I learn from my inspection as a reference. Special Envoy Kong and I are scheduled to depart on the Victoria on April 2. A portion of the entourage will go to England by another route.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Goes to Hangzhou Yesterday Morning to Visit Chiang Kai-shek for Instructions</h3>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, who has been ordered to be transferred to the position of Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, is scheduled to go south to take office at the beginning of next month.

<h3>Diao Zuojian Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Discusses the Recent Decrease in Smuggling in South China. Will Go to Nanjing Soon to Visit Foreign Minister Wang to Report on His Duties.</p>
<p>Diao Zuojian, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (29th) at 1:30 PM aboard the Italian shipping company's ship Victoria from Hong Kong and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. A Central News Agency reporter paid him a visit. According to him, he was dispatched to Guangdong last August and has been in office for seven months, so he is going north to Nanjing to visit Foreign Minister Wang to report on his duties. Since the political situation in Guangdong and Guangxi has been stabilized, everything has been on the right track, and the abolition of miscellaneous taxes has been especially pleasing to the people of the two provinces. The people of Guangdong deeply mourn the death of Huang Musong, the former chairman of the provincial government, and consider it a major loss for the people of Baiyue. Since Huang took office, he has actively reorganized the administration and sought welfare for the people. As for smuggling in South China, it has recently decreased. The reason is that the customs crackdown is strict and the dishonest merchants who collude with smugglers are severely punished. It is also due to the unified spirit of solidarity of the people of Guangdong. Since smuggling extended to South China, the legitimate Chinese merchants, considering that it is difficult to distinguish whether Japanese goods are smuggled, are wary of buying Japanese goods, which has affected the business of legitimate Japanese merchants. As a result, Japanese merchants have voluntarily asked their government to ban smugglers from smuggling in South China and to send the smugglers in Guangdong back to their country, which shows that legitimate Japanese merchants also hate the smuggling of Japanese gangsters.</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou to be Employer Representative at International Labor Conference</h3>
<p>Various Organizations Recommended Yesterday. Tian He** and Xie Jia as Advisors.</p>
<p>The 23rd International Labor Conference is scheduled to be held in Geneva on June 3rd of this year.

Lin Kanghou, Guo Shun, Wang Qiyu, Wu YunChu, Qian Chengxu, Cai Shengbai, Cheng Haifeng, director of the China branch of the National Labor Bureau, and Wu Kaitian, dispatched by the Ministry of Treasures, attended the meeting. Guo Shun chaired the meeting. After discussion, it was decided to recommend Lin Kanghou as the employer representative to the 23rd International Labor Conference, Tian He** as an advisor, and Xie Jia as an advisor and secretary. The two associations will jointly submit a report to the Ministry of Industry for review and appointment.</p>
<h3>Spain Voluntarily Abandons Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>Civil and Criminal Cases Involving Spanish Nationals Should Be Handled by Our Country in Accordance with the Law.</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Ministry of Finance issued an order to the relevant agencies stating: "The Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 1417 of March 16th of this year states: 'The Judicial Yuan's Consultation No. 29 of March 8th of this year states: "After the coup in Spain, the Spanish envoys and consuls stationed in our country have successively left their posts. In fact, the consular jurisdiction has been voluntarily abandoned. Since there is no legitimate agency to handle cases involving Spanish nationals, for the sake of protecting public safety and legal interests, the competent judicial agencies should uniformly accept cases involving Spanish nationals in China for adjudication in accordance with the law in order to provide relief." The Ministry, in accordance with its responsibilities, has already consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and issued orders to all courts to comply. In the future, when accepting civil and criminal cases involving Spanish nationals, they must be handled expeditiously in accordance with the law and reported to the Ministry for record. In addition to informing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Supreme Court, please review, present to the Executive Yuan for record, and inform the relevant agencies accordingly." Therefore, in addition to submitting a report to the National Government for record, we hereby consult your Yuan for review and inform the relevant agencies accordingly. This order, etc.' In addition to distributing the order, we hereby order you to acknowledge it and inform the relevant agencies accordingly. This order."</p>
<h3>Appointment of Wu Nanru as Minister to Denmark, Returned to China Yesterday Afternoon and Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Nanru, the former Counselor and Chargé d'Affaires of our Embassy in the Soviet Union, newly appointed Minister to Denmark, returned to China on leave. He departed from Italy by the Victoria liner at the beginning of the month and arrived at 1:30 PM yesterday. Dozens of Wu's relatives and friends went to the China Merchants North Wharf to welcome him. After disembarking, Mr. Wu immediately returned to his residence to rest. He will stay in Shanghai for about two or three days before going to Beijing to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on his work in the Soviet Union and Denmark. Then, he will return to his native Yixing to bury his late father. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Wu on the ship yesterday. Mr. Wu gave the following account: "I have been granted leave by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to return to China for about three months. After the leave, I will return to Denmark to resume my post. As for this return to China, firstly, because I served in the Embassy in the Soviet Union for four years before going to Denmark, I should report to the government on the work situation during these four years. Secondly, in the past four or five years, domestic construction has progressed rapidly, and foreign opinions often praise it. As diplomatic officials, we should be familiar with the situation in our country so that we can deal with foreign affairs more appropriately. Thirdly, my father passed away in December last year. I was unable to return home at that time. Now I plan to take advantage of this vacation to arrange the funeral and handle other private matters." When the reporter asked about Sino-Soviet relations, Mr. Wu seemed unwilling to express any opinion. However, he smiled and said, "Our country is willing to maintain friendship with any country that treats us equally and does not harbor aggressive ambitions." Regarding the situation in Denmark, Mr. Wu said, "Our country's foreign trade has always been a deficit, but with Denmark, we have had a surplus for many years. Three years ago, the value of our annual surplus of goods was more than 20 million national currency, but it has shrunk in recent years. How to seek continued development in the future is a problem worthy of attention." Regarding the general trend in Europe, Mr. Wu said, "There will be no breakdown in one or two years. However, since the failure of the disarmament conference and the frustration of collective security, European countries are now competing to increase military preparations. The United Kingdom has also recently passed a budget to increase military preparations by 1.5 billion pounds in five years. All countries have completely restored the armed peace of before 1914. However, the so-called armed peace can only postpone the war, but it cannot eliminate it. Moreover, after the postponement, the outbreak of war will be even more brutal."</p>
<h3>Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Other Rice Merchants Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>Requesting a Ban on the Import of Foreign Rice into Guangdong</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, grain merchants from Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces and cities, after learning that the central government had approved the tax-free import of foreign rice into Guangdong, all believed that this move would affect the rural economy. In addition to Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Shanghai Grain Industry Association, visiting the newly appointed Governor of Guangdong Province, Wu Tiecheng, in Shanghai a few days ago to present a petition, explaining the advantages and disadvantages and requesting a suspension, representatives of local grain organizations specifically scheduled to gather in Nanjing at 9:00 AM on the 30th to petition the Central Political Committee, the Executive Yuan, the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and other agencies to stop it. The representatives have successively gone to Beijing. Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Shanghai Grain Industry Association, Zhu Zixiang of the Bean and Rice Association, Chen Shide, Cao Zhixin, representative of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Rice Industry Joint Association, and others took the Shanghai-Ping Train at 4:00 PM yesterday and are scheduled to arrive in Beijing this morning to jointly petition with representatives from various provinces and cities. They are expected to stay for one to three days and then return to Shanghai. The petition is recorded as follows: "The taxation of imported foreign rice began in the winter of the 21st year of the Republic of China [1932]. However, Guangdong Province did not unify the tax rate until last year. Considering the lack of grain, it made a request for tax exemption. The central government has accommodated its request and approved the import of one million dan of half-tax recorded foreign rice. However, recent news has spread that another one million dan each of tax-free foreign rice and foreign grains will be imported into Guangdong to alleviate the shortage during the transition period. If this becomes a reality, it will gradually lead to the encroachment of foreign rice, and it will add to the burden of the central government's relief to rural areas. To speak of its disadvantages, it is actually no different from worrying about immediate problems and forgetting about internal organs. Therefore, we venture to present our humble opinions to Your Excellency for consideration. According to the foreign rice tax, it is stipulated in the current customs tariff. Customs duties should adopt a unified system within the same territory. This is something that no one disagrees with. At the beginning of the taxation of foreign rice in our country, Guangdong and Fujian provinces held different views. There were other political reasons, not entirely related to the people's food. After the unification of political orders in Fujian Province, this tax was also levied as a clear proof. During Chen Jitang's administration in Guangdong Province, a large amount of foreign rice was allowed to be imported, resulting in a very large trade deficit in international trade. Fortunately, the political orders have also been unified in the past few years, so the unified collection of this tax should not be disregarded again. This is one reason why the foreign rice tax should not be exempted in terms of the integrity of customs duties. Domestic trade is valued for its ability to exchange goods and adjust the national economy to move towards prosperity. Last year, when Guangdong Province requested exemption from the foreign rice tax, the Executive Yuan ordered the Hunan Provincial Government to quickly plan for the relief and convenience of selling Hunan rice to Guangdong and ordered the Railway Department to quickly set a special price for Hunan rice transported to Guangdong, so that the economies and food of the two provinces could be mutually adjusted. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance also confirmed that the foreign rice tax was established to protect domestic agricultural products and that the provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui had bumper harvests last year and had surplus grain to supply the needs of Guangdong Province. The food shortage in Guangdong Province should be purchased from domestic rice as much as possible for relief. True knowledge and insight have been deeply stated. Although Guangdong Province is a grain-deficient area, it is better to obtain resources from the interior than to rely on foreign rice. In recent years, the rural economy has been on the verge of bankruptcy. Fortunately, there were bumper harvests in various places last year, and there are signs of gradual recovery. If Guangdong Province still allows tax-free foreign rice to encroach and sell, farmers in the interior will be in a desperate situation due to the obstruction of rice sales. This is the second reason why the foreign rice tax should not be exempted in terms of the national economy. As for Guangdong Province, although the central government has allowed one million dan of half-tax recorded foreign rice to be imported and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway has added special trains to transport Hunan rice, and the Grain Transportation Bureau has specially hired ships to transport Anhui rice, according to the investigation report of the Transportation Department, the so-called rice shortage panic has become a thing of the past. Even recently, each producing area has transported a surplus of grain to Guangdong, such as more than 100,000 shi of rice specially transported from Shanghai, and the surplus grain transported from Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces is even more numerous, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the transition period with surplus. In addition, the climate in Lingnan is warm, and rice matures early, and the harvest period is not far away. Therefore, there is absolutely no shortage of rice in the future. This is the third reason why the foreign rice tax does not need to be exempted in terms of Guangdong Province's people's food. In summary, it is undoubtedly clear that it is not appropriate to change the Guangdong Province's tax collection. We hope that Your Excellency will investigate and strictly prevent the internal tax on foreign rice, so as to maintain the integrity of customs duties and promote the national economy. We are extremely fortunate. Respectfully presented by the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry, Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, Shanghai Grain Store Industry Association, and the United Association of Rice Industry Associations of Ningbo and Shanghai Municipalities and Counties."</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Labor Dispute to be Mediated Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday was a Statutory Memorial Day, and Workers Stopped Work Uniformly</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a mediation for the silk weaving factory workers' demands for improved treatment conditions at 9:00 AM today. Yesterday was the Memorial Day of the Huanghuagang Martyrs. According to the central government's regulations, all factories were closed for one day with wages paid as usual. However, silk weaving factory workers have never taken holidays. Since the mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, which stipulated that statutory memorial days should be handled in accordance with the Factory Law, the industrial unions of the silk weaving industry in various districts notified the workers of each factory the night before that they should take a day off with wages paid as usual. Therefore, the workers of various factories belonging to Mei Ya and Hengfeng in the Pudong district and Baohua in the Puxi district all stopped working yesterday.</p>
<p>Disturbances Occurred</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, silk weaving factories such as Shengdan in Nanshi, Puxi, Pudong, and Zhabei districts continued to operate as usual. However, the workers did not enter the factory to work. The industrial unions of the colored weaving industry in various districts organized pickets to explain to the workers that statutory memorial days should be taken off with wages paid as usual. Because some factories did not allow work to stop, disturbances occurred. Fortunately, the local police stations dispatched police to suppress them, and no incidents occurred. It is heard that the workers of each factory said that they would go to work as usual this morning.</p>
<p>Workers' Meeting</p>
<p>The representatives of the workers of each factory held a representative assembly at the Wusa Cemetery in Baziqiao, Zhabei, at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 800 representatives of workers from factories such as Mei Ya, Baohua, Da Mei, and Jiu Hua attended. In addition to reporting on the 30 conditions for improved treatment proposed by the workers mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Party Department, it was also resolved to rescue the arrested workers of the Tenth Mei Ya Factory and to comfort the released and injured workers of the Tenth Mei Ya Factory, requesting the factory to notify the meals provided to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future, etc. The meeting adjourned at about 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Ye Chucang Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Visited Kong Xiangxi to Say Goodbye</p>
<p>Mr. Lai Chucang, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, left Beijing the day before yesterday (the 28th) and passed through Xixi to Shanghai. After getting off the train at the North Station that night, he returned to his residence to rest. He went out yesterday morning to visit Mr. Kong Xiangxi, who was sent to England to participate in the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor, to say goodbye. Then, he invited Qian Xinzhai, President of Fudan University, Wu Nanxuan, Vice President, and others to discuss school affairs. It is heard that the Jiangsu Provincial Education Funds Management Office has donated a piece of land near Meiyuan in Wuxi to Fudan University. Mr. Ye made a special trip to investigate. The site is located at the foot of the mountain, facing Taihu Lake, and the environment is excellent, which is very suitable for building school buildings. Therefore, he will actively plan the construction. It is also learned that Mr. Ye has already taken the night train back to Beijing last night.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Literary and Art Association (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>Speech by Vice Minister Fang</p>
<p>Next, Fang Zhi, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, delivered a speech, saying, "Today is the day of the establishment of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Literary and Art Association. I feel very honored to be able to attend the grand meeting. Especially during the previous meeting of the initiators, I was invited to attend and heard the insightful opinions of many gentlemen in the Shanghai literary and art circles. I know that your association will soon be established, and the organization will definitely be sound. Now, as expected, the inaugural meeting is held today, and so many people have attended, and the charter is so detailed, which shows that the future development of your association will be immeasurable. This is predictable. During this inaugural meeting, I have two points to contribute to you for reference, and I also ask for your guidance. First, we must have a self-disciplined attitude. In the past, whether we ran newspapers or schools, we often took the meaning of others as our own and could not examine and regulate ourselves. Now, we must change the old malpractices. Whether we run newspapers or schools, we must seek improvement and achieve concrete development. As the chairman reported just now, the literary and art circles in the past did not have a concrete organization, and the will could not be unified. Now everyone feels this shortcoming. The literary and art circles should unite and organize themselves to examine themselves and study literary and artistic works, so that culture will improve day by day, and the future of literary and art will be brighter and brighter. The first point is to develop the commonality of the people and correct the personality of the people. It is very important to develop the personality of the people. Literary and artistic works are the only tool for developing the personality of the people. However, in developing personality, do not forget the commonality of the people. I hope that after the establishment of the Chinese Literary and Art Association, writers across the country will develop personality on the one hand and fully express the commonality of the thoughts of young people and the entire Chinese cultural cause in literary and art. What is the commonality of the people? It is to carry out the literary and art renaissance movement on the one hand and the national rejuvenation movement on the other hand. This national rejuvenation movement is the commonality that the people should have at the current stage. I hope that you will unite the national literary and artistic writers and lead the general youth from this commonality, which will surely make a great contribution to the country and the nation. Finally, I wish your association an unlimited future."</p>
<p>Speech by Committee Member Tong</p>
<p>Then, Tong Xingbai, a Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Special City Party Department, delivered a speech, saying, "After the establishment of your association, there should be a common belief in order to have mutual trust. This has already been mentioned in the initiation. I hope that all members of your association will have a deep faith in this central theory. Secondly, I hope that your association will not only bear the responsibility of reviving literary and art but also shoulder the responsibility of national rejuvenation. China had a new trend before the first year of the Republic of China [1912], that is, the rise of nationalistic literary and artistic works led to the rapid success of the national revolution. After that, there was a new cultural movement, which greatly helped the revolution after the 15th year of the Republic of China [1926]. Therefore, the literary and art circles have made a great contribution to the history of the Chinese revolution. At present, the biggest movement in China is the national rejuvenation movement, and the national rejuvenation movement requires efforts in all aspects, and the literary and art renaissance movement is the central movement in the national rejuvenation movement. Therefore, I hope that after the establishment of the Literary and Art Association, there will be a new literary and art movement to promote the national rejuvenation movement."</p>
<p>Speech by Director Pan</p>
<p>Today, because time is limited, I will not speak too much, but I will contribute two words. The first word is "open mind." I firmly believe that the members of your association will be fully united and completely eliminate all opinions that may have existed in the past in this association. Open your minds and join hands. The second word is "grasp the era." I hope that the work of your association will clearly recognize the current era and firmly grasp it. We certainly do not want to be behind the times, but we do not want to surpass the times too much. The rush to run makes all literary and artistic works in line with the needs of the country and the nation, and I wish the achievements of your association will be unlimited.</p>

<p>Results of the Election</p>
<p>Jiǎn Yòuwén, Chuán Dōnghuá, Shào Xúnměi, Zhào Wúchēn, Hú Zhòngchí, Gù Zhòngyí, Yìng Yúnwèi, Hóng Shēn, Zhū Yìngpéng, Fán Zhòngyún, Shěn Qǐyǔ, Yè Yèfèng, Xiàng Péiliáng, Zhōu Hánméi, Lǐ Qīngyá, Wāng Fùzhū, Yáo Sūfèng, Shī Zhé cún, Zhèng Zhènduó, Zhōu Jiànyún, Ōuyáng Yǔqiàn, and other 21 people were elected as directors.

<p>Declaration of the General Assembly</p>
<p>The initiation of this association has several meanings. The most important ones are listed below. We know that the ancients had the so-called "meeting friends with literature." Now the scope of the world is larger, and new knowledge and new ideas are emerging endlessly. However, personal knowledge is limited. Therefore, if we can gather together, we can gather wisdom and benefit each other, which will greatly benefit our learning. This is the first. Moreover, we know that the biggest reason why misunderstandings and barriers occur between friends is the lack of opportunities to gather and talk freely. Therefore, if we can meet often and talk together, then the so-called "writers despise each other, which has been the case since ancient times" may not necessarily be the case today. This is the second. Moreover, today, in order to protect its own interests, any industry has a trade association. Literary and artistic production is no different from commodities, and literary and artistic writers have the same interests and need to act together, such as copyright protection and the introduction of works. Therefore, the organization of the Literary and Art Association is also necessary. This is the third. From a larger perspective, Shanghai is the center of Sino-foreign transportation and the center of China's cultural publishing industry. However, the literary and art circles have always been self-interested and rarely connected. We believe that if we can jointly establish an organization, it will not only provide a mutual communication mechanism for the country, but also enable us to interact with the international community, which will benefit cultural diplomacy. This is the fourth. Fifth, today's China is in a critical situation, like a pile of eggs. Resisting the enemy and defending against insults requires the suffering and sacrifice of the entire people. However, inspiring the national spirit, promoting the national concept, and establishing a strong spiritual national defense are the responsibilities of those of us engaged in literary and art. This also requires us to be able to combine and work together. Therefore, after several discussions, we initiated the organization of the Chinese Literary and Art Association, and the Shanghai Branch was established first. We hope that literary and artistic colleagues in Shanghai will join together to form a large alliance.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Citizens' Association to the Public Works Department Requesting Reconsideration of the Cancellation of the Increase in General Taxes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday morning, stating: "Dear Sirs, we have learned that your bureau has ignored the facts of social and economic decline and has disregarded the opinions of the five Chinese directors, who represent more than 64% of the tax revenue and more than 95% of the population. It has established a proposal to increase the general tax by 2%, from 14% to 16%, and the land tax by 1/1000, from 7/1000 to 8/1000, and is preparing to submit it to the taxpayers' meeting. The association deeply regrets this. We are sending you a copy of the association's declaration and letter to the citizens of the Shanghai First Special District. Please investigate immediately and reconsider the cancellation of the proposal."</p>
<h3>Chinese Disasters in the Past Fifteen Years</h3>
<p>Foreign Discussions Translated from the French Shanghai Daily reported that French Father Chakinot wrote a letter to the French Shanghai Daily, saying, "Regarding the cooperation between China and foreign countries, people used to think that the East is the East, and the West is the West, and there is no possibility of coordination. However, in the past fifteen years, our cooperation in the Sino-Foreign Relief Association has shown that the views of the past are unreliable. The prevalence of natural and man-made disasters is not unique to China. Even the modernization of the United States cannot prevent the overflow of the Mississippi River, and the technicalization of Russia still has the problem of famine from time to time. As for England and France, although the organization of disaster prevention is perfect, there are ways to prevent the frequent occurrence of disasters, but with the large land of China, it is difficult to compare. It is not appropriate for us to compare the Thames River in England and the Seine River in France with the Yellow River and the Yangtze River in China. The disaster of the Yellow River in China has been going on for thousands of years. In the era of Yao and Shun in China, two thousand years before the Christian era, water management had already become a major problem. Today, we are more than two thousand years after the Christian era, and the disaster of the Yellow River is still the same. Since the Yellow River changed its course in 1852, its disaster has become more and more serious. In addition to natural disasters in China, there are also man-made disasters, such as the civil wars, bandits, and communist troops over the years, which have further fueled the abuse. Fortunately, since the establishment of the Nanjing government, these man-made disasters have gradually decreased. Due to the vast land and serious disaster situation in China, it is difficult to succeed without the relief of Sino-foreign cooperation. According to the statistics of various charitable relief agencies, only a small number of disaster victims are receiving relief and waiting to be born. According to the statistics of the Sino-Foreign Relief Association, for every one million people rescued, there must be three million disaster victims who starve to death. And this one million people rescued is not solely the credit of the Relief Association. There are many disaster relief agencies in China, and the Relief Association is only one of them. In the past fifteen years, the Sino-Foreign Relief Association has received donations from all parties totaling 9 million yuan, and the income of other charitable organizations is probably even more than that. Regarding the use of relief funds, the Sino-Foreign Relief Association has spent 55% on direct relief, and another 45% on work relief. According to Father Chakinot, the work relief projects undertaken by the Sino-Foreign Relief Association are all public welfare undertakings, such as the dredging of the Huai River and the planting of forests in Gansu and Shaanxi. After the public utilities are increased, they directly seek to relieve the disaster victims, so that they do not develop a habit of eating idly. Indirectly, they are also sufficient to engage in the important work of preventing disasters. According to the statistics of Catholic Father Chakinot, the disaster relief work of the Sino-Foreign Relief Association actually began in 1920-21. At the beginning, it paid much attention to publicity work. In the first year, it received donations of 2,436,561 yuan and 41 cents as a fund. In 1922, it received donations of 2,003,497 yuan and was responsible for disaster relief work in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, with work relief as the mainstay. In 1923, it received 1,059,480 yuan, which was used exclusively for road construction and dike construction in Anhui, with a total road length of 1,061 li and a dike length of 937 li. In 1924-25, it received donations of 355,955 yuan to relieve the drought in Zhejiang, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, with Guizhou being the worst. In 1926, it received 34,971 yuan in relief funds to be used for work relief in Jiangsu. In 1927-28, it carried out work relief specifically in Shandong, Henan, and Guangdong provinces, spending only 124,996 yuan in relief funds. In 1929, it used 360,246 yuan to relieve the disaster victims in Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Tongdong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces. The work relief method was to assist the government in carrying out the Huai River diversion project, which was beneficial to farming. In 1930, the work relief in Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces cost 120,830 yuan. At that time, more than 100,000 disaster victims in Henan were sent to Lanzhou. In 1931, due to the flood of the Yangtze River, more funds were used, costing 1,449,069 yuan, and dikes were repaired in Gaoyou and other places. In 1932, it received donations of 390,752 yuan, which were mostly used for the canal project in northern Jiangsu, and the dike in Gaoyou was also continued, employing 50,000 workers at a cost of 400,000 yuan. When the engineers of the League of Nations came to visit, they also exclaimed it as a masterpiece. In 1933, it received donations of 42,462 yuan, which were mostly used for relief work in Shaanxi and Jiangxi. In 1934, it received donations of 99,856 yuan. In 1935, it received donations of 383,290 yuan. In 1936, it received donations of 250,000 yuan. The work relief in these three years has spread to various cities, especially the provinces in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Sichuan Drought Relief Association</h3>
<p>Third Delegation of Representatives to Petition the Capital Regularly: Requesting the Issuance of 10 Million Yuan in Public Bonds for Relief</p>
<p>The drought in Sichuan has been intensifying since last autumn. Now, not only are beans and wheat failing, but rice is also difficult to plant. Even drinking water is scarce. Hundreds of thousands of people are starving, and the tragic situation is unbearable to hear. The Sichuan Provincial Association here previously sent Li Qingfan, Lü Yifeng, Mei Xinru, and others to Beijing to contact the Sichuan Provincial Association in Beijing and make a second petition to the central government for relief. They returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 28th). According to them, the central government has already allocated 200,000 yuan to handle emergency relief. However, with the disaster area spanning more than 120 counties and the number of starving people reaching over 3 million, this is just a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. Therefore, the association convened an emergency meeting yesterday (the 29th) and established the Drought Relief Association. Xie Chi, Yang Shukan, Xiong Kewu, Huang Fusheng, Xu Keting, Lü Yifeng, Tang Jinfan, Li Xunfu, Li Qingfan, Mei Xinru, Pu Fengma, Yang Jifu, Zheng Yushu, Ren Wangnan, Zhang Shulin, Fan Zhongqu, Tang Dean, Yu Yunlan, Li Boshen, Gu Juliu, Lei Yu, Chun and others were elected as members. They will contact the Sichuan Provincial Association in Beijing to solicit donations and petition the government to issue 10 million yuan in Sichuan disaster relief public bonds for fundamental relief. At the same time, Li Qingfan, Lü Yifeng, and Mei Xinru will be sent to Beijing for the third time on April 1 to petition.</p>

<h3>YWCA Opens Second Dormitory</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YWCA has had a dormitory for more than 20 years. Not only are the internal facilities suitable for women, but the prices of meals and accommodation are also affordable for women. The YWCA also pays close attention to the personality and academic performance of the boarders. Therefore, the dormitory is not only the safest place for women from all over the country to stay when passing through Shanghai, but also an indispensable place for professional women in Shanghai to stay. As a result, it enjoys a high reputation, and there are many applicants. The dormitory at 323 Moore Road is not enough to meet the demand, so a second dormitory has been opened at 638 Weihaiwei Road. It is currently under construction and is expected to open at the end of this month. Anyone who wants to stay can go directly to 638 Weihaiwei Road (telephone: 37633) to contact the dormitory department and obtain a copy of the regulations.</p>

<p>After the Ministry of Finance decided to increase the unified cigarette tax starting next month, cigarette factories have repeatedly requested the Ministry of Finance and the Taxation Department to find ways to provide relief and postpone the implementation, but their requests have not been approved. Knowing that the tax increase is inevitable, cigarette stores are rushing to purchase cigarettes in order to gain the benefit of the tax difference. The demand for cigarettes from both local and foreign manufacturers, such as Blue Baishigan from Huamei, Golden Mouse from Huacheng, White Gold Dragon from Nanyang, and Red Sister from Hehe, is exceeding supply. Therefore, cigarette factories have been rushing to produce day and night since yesterday to meet the demand.</p>
<h3>Wang Daguanzi, Who Cheated in Gambling and Robbed Money, Sentenced</h3>

They used three poker cards to lure people into the game, and took the opportunity to rob Ningbo woman Ye Yuan of 50 yuan in national currency, which they divided among themselves. After the incident, they were arrested by the Chinese and foreign detectives of the Huishan Police Station and sent to the Special Court. The victim, Ye Yuan, has returned to Ningbo. The defendant's testimony was cunning. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Bianfen interrogated the case in the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Wang Daguanzi to six months in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Shu Shunfu Sentenced for Fraudulently Obtaining Money</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Two Years in Prison</p>
<p>Shu Shunfu, a Ningbo native from Tonghe Catering Company at 217 Wuchang Road, had been a clerk in the company for many years and was trusted by the manager, Wu Huanan, a Cantonese. Recently, he suddenly had a strange idea and was blinded by greed. Between January 6 and February 1 of this year, he took the opportunity to steal three blank checks from the company, stamped them, and had his friend Chen Axiang, who is still at large, fill in the amount. He withdrew a total of 923 yuan in three installments from the Yong'an Hongkou Branch on North Sichuan Road and then secretly returned to his home at 47 Yangmiaoqian, Zhenhainanmen, Ningbo, to hide. After the incident, the Hongkou Police Station was reported, and Chinese detective Fang Fucheng was sent with a letter from the First Special District Court to arrest him at his address together with the local police station. Only 5 yuan in banknotes, a gold ring, and silver coins worth a total of 28 yuan were found on his person. He was taken to Shanghai and sent to the Third Criminal Court. It was found that he had used more than 400 yuan of the money he had taken to buy groceries and utensils, and he had deposited 500 yuan in the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank in Xiaodongmen, Shanghai. The deposit book was hidden in a clothes box at his home in Ningbo, but the money was withdrawn by his family during the change of address. Regarding the civil suit attached to the company, the defendant's relative, surnamed Wu, mediated with manager Wu Huanan and compensated 300 yuan, and there were also wooden utensils worth more than 200 yuan, which he was willing to auction off to return the money. The defendant was sent back to the hall to await sentencing. The stolen goods and the money obtained from the sale of stolen goods would be returned to the original owner. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Bianfen presided over the court and sentenced Shu Shunfu to two years in prison and a fine of 500 yuan. If he was to perform labor service, it would be calculated at 3 yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Lu Wensheng Prosecuted for Dismantling and Selling Radios</h3>
<p>Mao Anfu, a native of Zhenjiang, who lives at 5 Yanging Lane, Zhonghua Road, and serves as a No. 16 detective in the French Concession Police Station, handed over a seven-tube radio worth more than 200 yuan to Guanghua Electrical Appliances Store at 24 Fangxie Road for repairs in June or July of the year before last. Later, he lost the repair slip and went to pick it up, but the store falsely claimed that it had not been repaired and dismantled and sold the various parts of the radio. Therefore, Mao reported the incident to the police at 5 p.m. yesterday and had the store manager, Lu Wensheng (17 years old, local), arrested and taken to the police station. Lu claimed that there were many radios being repaired in the store and that he did not know whether there was Mao's radio or not, and that he did not remember it. He was charged with embezzlement and sent to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Chen Genbao, the Mastermind of the Shantung Road Robbery, Arrested</h3>
<p>At 9 a.m. on February 6 of this year, a woman surnamed Zhang Song in the Zhang Song Hotel at 57 Shantang Road, Pudong, was robbed by two bandits who entered the hotel under the pretext of buying soy sauce and stole a gold ring, a pair of gold earrings, and two gold teeth from her mouth. At the time, one of the bandits, named Fan Gensheng, was arrested by the police for losing his position on the battlefield and sent to the General Bureau and then to the court for interrogation and detention. It is now known that Chen Genbao (27 years old, from Pudong), the mastermind of the case, was hiding in the Yanzike at 5 Liufen Lane, Luxiangyuan Road in the city. Yesterday morning, the detectives of the Shandong Detective Branch, Chen Chengzhang and Liu Hanxia, discovered the information and reported it to the leader of the Fifth Team, who sent team leader Han Cuixun and team members Liu Changrui and Wu Tao to arrest Chen at his address together with the Laobeimen Police Station. According to his confession, he admitted to threatening the victim with a gun and stealing the gold jewelry. Captain Wang will wait for the stolen goods to be recovered and transfer the case to the branch for handling.</p>
<h3>A Woman Requests Mediation for Divorce from Her Unscrupulous Husband</h3>
<p>A local woman, Hou Zhang, 34 years old, currently residing at 6 Shengdeli, Guling Road, sued her husband, Hou Shaotang (39 years old, residing at 19 Houjiazhai, 614 Haig Road), for divorce in the local court. She stated that she married her husband at the age of 17. However, six or seven years ago, the defendant became involved with bad people, behaved improperly, and developed addictions. Since then, he has been neglecting his duties and living off his savings. Every time she tried to persuade him, he would not listen and even beat and scold her. Unable to bear it, she went out to work as a helper. The defendant still did not improve and come to his senses, and came to blackmail her. Therefore, she requested a divorce so that she could have a way out. The court ordered the defendant to appear, but mediation failed. He was ordered to file a formal lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Fire at Dapu Road Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Association for Participation in the Paris Exposition to Convene General Meeting Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>Ambassador Gu Cables Progress of Negotiations with France</p>
<p>Regarding China's participation in the Paris International Exposition, the association has been soliciting entries from all parties, and many have been sent from various places. The Jicha entry selection branch has also collected more than a thousand excellent entries, which are scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai on the 5th of next month. As for the participation method, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Ambassador Gu stationed in France to negotiate with the French government, and there have been results, which have also been reported by cable. The association is scheduled to convene a general meeting tomorrow (the 31st) morning to discuss the progress. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Jicha Entries Scheduled to Be Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>The China Association for Participation in the Paris International Exposition was initiated by members of the Central Committee, such as Shi Ceng and Chu Minyi. It was jointly established by four organizations: the China Association for World Cultural Cooperation, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and the Shanghai Bankers' Association. A selection committee was established, and leaders from the educational, cultural, industrial, and commercial circles of Shanghai were hired to be responsible for collecting entries. People from all parties responded enthusiastically and participated. The Ji-Cha Political Affairs Committee has established a selection branch to assist in the progress and has collected more than a thousand excellent entries, which are packed in about 30 boxes. They will be shipped to Shanghai on April 5 and cabled: "Letter 105 received with respect. If it is necessary to review them, please send personnel to Beijing to handle them to avoid the cumbersome opening procedures and the fear of wasting time and delaying matters. How we hope to reply in order to welcome them." After receiving the telegram from the Ji-Cha entry selection branch in Beijing, whether or not to send personnel to review them is still under discussion. The entries collected in Shanghai have not yet been decided even after the selection committee has reviewed them twice. The preparation of catalogs and explanations is being actively carried out. Therefore, after discussion by the presidium, Li Shizeng, Chu Minyi, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaolai, and Lin Kanghou, it was decided to hold a general meeting at 10 a.m. on the 31st in the auditorium of the World Academy on Fooking Road to discuss the progress.

<p>Ambassador Gu Cables the Results of the Negotiations</p>
<p>After the association was established, it was approved by the Executive Yuan for record and issued 50,000 yuan in funding to assist it. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was ordered to notify French Ambassador Nazia to inform the French government and to instruct Ambassador Gu Weijun stationed in France to negotiate with the French government. Ambassador Gu has now cabled the results of the negotiations as follows: "Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nanjing, regarding the participation in the Exposition, I have been negotiating with the authorities here for the past two months, going through four or five agencies and consulting back and forth more than ten times. I have now received a definite reply that they will make a special arrangement to allocate one or two rooms in the International East Hall for our exhibition, completely free of charge, on the condition that we state that this participation is sponsored by our government. The construction of this exhibition hall is specifically for the use of officially participating countries. I believe that the purpose of this Exposition is to express the ideas and feelings of all nations and is truly a grand international movement to promote modern civilization and material progress. The world is watching, so many countries are enthusiastically participating. There are now nearly 50 countries. I have heard that our eastern neighbor has a huge construction plan and that the exhibits they have prepared are particularly exquisite. They also plan to advertise for the puppet state. The French government also intends to use this Exposition to stabilize finance and recover the economy, so they attach great importance to it and are extremely generous to the representatives, overseas Chinese, and tourists from officially participating countries to show their encouragement. They are surprised and show contempt for our non-participation. I am afraid that after the opening, people from various countries will have more misunderstandings. Fortunately, the domestic organization has established an association to find ways to participate unofficially, which will help to remedy the situation. However, the exhibits must also be carefully selected and carefully selected with reference to the standard programs issued by the Exposition. We must also compile systematic charts, images, and photos to represent the new spirit, new construction, new education, and new life of the entire country and nation, and use this to promote and change the general Western perception of us. I hope the government will fully assist the association with funding so that it can make appropriate arrangements and displays to achieve good results. I also hope that the Ministries of Education and Industry will select two specialists to come to France to carefully examine and study the overall situation and report back to the country for reference, which will be of great benefit to the future of our industry, education, literature, technology, and art. I respectfully request that the above points be forwarded to the relevant ministries and the association. Now, the location has been determined. I urgently request that the government inform me of its intentions regarding the so-called conditions so that I can formally notify the French government in accordance with the previous order."</p>
<h3>New Hong Kong Government Regulations for Entry of Travelers</h3>
<p>Citizens of Thirteen Countries May Enter Freely; Americans and Others Must Obtain Consular Visas</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government has issued new regulations for the entry of travelers. All persons of various nationalities arriving in Hong Kong, except for those from thirteen countries, including Germany, Japan, France, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, and Ireland, may disembark in Hong Kong without a consular visa. All other travelers, such as those from the United States, must have a consular visa when they disembark from the ship, otherwise they will be in violation of the entry regulations and will be prosecuted and punished. Recently, some foreign nationals have gone to Hong Kong without knowing the new regulations, so the Hong Kong government has specially distributed this new regulation to Shanghai to notify the shipping companies that any foreign nationals traveling to Hong Kong who do not have a consular visa, except for those from the thirteen countries, will be strictly punished, and the shipping companies are ordered to publicize this new regulation.</p>

<h3>The French Concession Employment Agency is Unable to Increase Donations</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association Sends Another Letter to the Board of Directors Requesting a Reduction in Donations</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency says that the French Concession Board of Directors has decided to increase the donations of employment agencies by twelve times. The industry is unable to bear it and has requested the Chinese Taxpayers Association to send a letter to the French Concession Board of Directors requesting a reduction. The association then received a reply that they were unable to make concessions. The association believes that the industry is indeed unable to bear it in reality, so it sent another letter to the French Concession Board of Directors yesterday requesting approval for a reduction in donations. The original letter stated: "In response to your letter of the 25th of this month, the Board of Directors has resolved to increase the donations of employment agencies. The amount of the donation is very small and we are unable to make concessions regarding your request for a reduction. Upon approval, we have found that the industry's business is declining, as was explained in detail in the previous letter. Even as stated in your letter, with a monthly introduction of 20 people and a salary of 4 yuan per person, according to the regulations of the employment agency, they can only obtain half of the first month's salary of the introduced employee, which is 2 yuan. For 20 people, the monthly income is only 40 yuan. There are also cases where it is less than this amount. In addition to the rent, taxes, water and electricity, sanitation, business tax, and all other expenses, can they maintain it, can they have any surplus, and can they afford to bear the increased donation? The situation should be clear to you. The French Concession Board of Directors should base the collection of taxes on the ability of the taxpayers. They cannot plan to take out of people, regardless of whether the taxpayers can afford it, and increase donations at will. Moreover, the industry originally paid an annual business tax of 2 yuan. The proportion of the tax rate it bears is already heavier than other industries. Now, suddenly, another 24 yuan is added, which in number is more than twelve times. How can it be said that the amount of the donation is small? In short, the industry is really unable to bear the increased donation. The details should be known when the industry has been summoned by the police on several occasions. Considering the situation, the French Concession Board of Directors should give them consideration. The association has been repeatedly requested by taxpayers and knows that the matter is difficult. It is not possible not to report it again. It is not sticking to preconceived ideas, nor is it protecting the industry. It is sincerely reporting the suffering of society in detail. We hope that the French Concession Board of Directors will carefully consider it, submit a review, and condescend to approve a reduction in the donation. We also hope to be able to persuade the association to act as a mediator so that everything can be fair. Before this matter is resolved, please do not impose pressure again by cutting off water and electricity as coercion. This is our sincere prayer. To the Shanghai French Concession Board of Directors."</p>

Chuan has a maid, Chen Junxiu, who, in February of last year, asked Chuan to keep a savings book of one thousand yuan from the Four Banks Savings Society. Chuan introduced and asked Wu to keep it and collect the money. On March 26 of the same year, Wu falsely told Chen Junxiu that the company wanted to buy chemicals and asked to borrow 500 yuan temporarily. Chen gave Wu the official seal to withdraw money from the bank. Unexpectedly, Wu withdrew 600 yuan. On April 25 of the same year, Wu claimed that the company had received a debt of 200 yuan to repay Chen's loan and asked Chen for the seal to deposit it back into the savings society. Wu then withdrew 200 yuan. On June 26 of the same year, Wu claimed to retrieve the savings book for Chen and used Chen's seal to withdraw another 100 yuan. On September 26 of the same year, Wu took the original savings book to the Four Banks Savings Society to close the account. The remaining balance of 100 yuan and 0.09 fen in national currency was taken away. On May 5 of the same year, Chen wanted to go to Wuxi to use money and was given a check for 200 yuan from the China Land Reclamation Bank. When she went to withdraw it, it was returned due to insufficient funds. On September 18 of the same year, Wu took a Hao Wan mat from Chen's house, claiming to sell it for 30 yuan, but only gave Chen 8 yuan and embezzled the rest. Later, Wu took a check for 40 yuan from the China Land Reclamation Bank from his friend, changed the withdrawal date on the check to the 17th, and gave it to Chen, giving Chen 10 yuan in change. When Chen went to withdraw the money, it was returned due to insufficient funds. Later, in September or October, on an unspecified date, Wu went to Chen's house and took five buckets of white paint, claiming to sell them, but pawned them at Yuchang Hardware Store for 25 yuan and used the money for himself. Chen, having been repeatedly deceived, twisted Wu to the police station and sent him to the procurator of the local court to file a public prosecution. Recently, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened a court session to hear the case. The plaintiff requested that Chuan Huaichen be jointly and severally liable for the private prosecution. The defendant, Wu Rongchu, testified that he only borrowed 500 yuan and did not commit fraud. The court announced that the hearing would be adjourned for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Female Criminal in Child Abuse Case Released on Bail Pending Childbirth</h3>
<p>Ji Wang, the 39-year-old wife of Ji Longcai, a native of Zhenjiang living at No. 10, Tongan Lane, Laoyongan Street, abused her five-year-old adopted son, Ji Fuxiang. When he became ill, she refused to give him medical treatment and instead beat him and burned him with a branding iron. As a result, the child died on January 25 of this year. Neighbors were dissatisfied and reported to the French police, who forwarded the report to the Second Special Court for examination of the body. Wang was sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution according to law. The trial concluded, and Ji Wang was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment. Wang was dissatisfied and appealed to the Third Branch Court of the High Court. During the trial, Ji Wang was pregnant and due to give birth soon. She was detained in the detention center and was also ill. She submitted a statement requesting that the detention be suspended, and she would be released on bail to await delivery before turning herself in for questioning. The Third Branch Court of the High Court ordered a forensic examination to confirm that Wang was indeed pregnant and ruled that she could be released on bail of 500 yuan, with a guarantor who could be summoned at any time to await delivery. Now the Shan family father has found a shop and two furniture stores and submitted a statement to guarantee her release.</p>
<h3>The Funeral of the Late Madam Wu, Mother of Wang</h3>
<p>The funeral of the late Madam Wu, mother of Wang Yansong and Yankang, was held at her hometown in Wanshi Village, Haoba, Shangchu, Zhejiang Province, on March 27th and 28th of this year. The Wang brothers are well-known figures in society and have extensive social connections. Therefore, plain cars and white horses filled the door with mourners. Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan, and officials from various ministries, departments, and offices of the central government and mayors of various provinces also sent condolence messages and plaques. Moreover, since this day happened to be the tomb-sweeping holiday stipulated by the silver and money industry, many members of the financial community in Shanghai made a special trip to express their condolences. The guests included Zhu Ziqiao, Wang Boyuan, Qin Runzhang, Pei Yunzhang, Yan Esheng, Luo Qinghua, and Ye Jiaxing, over 500 people in total. Hundreds of people from the local party, government, and military circles also went to pay their respects. The organizations participating in the public memorial service included the Shanghai Lianhuan Society, Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, Shanghai Municipal Industry Association, Huahua Silk Company, Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Fellow-Townsman Association, over ten organizations in total. For a time, the Cao Gonglu road was filled with traffic, a scene of great mourning.</p>
<h3>Small Fire on Sanpailou</h3>
<p>At about 1:40 PM yesterday afternoon, a fire broke out suddenly on the upper floor of the Yong Qin He Hotel at No. 138 on Sanpailou, Nanshi. The fire brigade drove to the scene and extinguished the fire by watering it. Only two rooms on the upper floor were destroyed, and the rest were not affected.</p>
<h3>Huade Light Bulbs Receive Honorary Award</h3>
<p>Huade Old Brand Light Bulbs, produced by the Huade Factory, have long been popular throughout the country and are well-known. It is heard that the Nanjing Municipal Government recently awarded a special-grade certificate, stating that it had been reviewed and approved by the Product Examination Committee of the Municipal National Goods Exhibition Hall and the Autumn National Goods Exhibition in 1926. This shows the supreme honor of Huade light bulbs.</p>
<h3>Two Friends Extend Their Exhibition and Celebrate</h3>
<p>The joint calligraphy and painting exhibition by female artists Yang Ruijiu and Wu Lizhen has been extended for three days in response to requests from various circles. Yesterday was the Memorial Day for Revolutionary Martyrs, and government agencies were closed, so the number of visitors was particularly large. He Tianjian wrote a poem for Luijiu's book, saying, "His spirit is strong and powerful, which is his talent. Shitian and Shitao are half reclusive and half secular, which is his path. Among women, he is lonely for thousands of years, but now we see this person." This shows his admiration. People from other cities, due to the distance, could not visit the exhibition in person, so they sent people to request that the exhibits be taken to their cities for exhibition to satisfy their eyes. For example, Lv Siyin, the instructor of the Binbo People's Club, and others have come to discuss this matter.</p>
<h3>How to Read Books, Newspapers, and Magazines</h3>
<p>Mr. Lv Shaoyu, a library expert, has been serving in the library field for more than ten years. His various books have long been valued by all sectors of society. Recently, he compiled the book "How to Read Books, Newspapers, and Magazines," which contributes the research findings and experiences of scholars at home and abroad to the readers. If scholars follow the reading methods he instructs, they can obtain the greatest learning results with less time and effort. The book is divided into three parts: upper, middle, and lower. The upper part is the method of reading books, the middle part is the method of reading newspapers, and the lower part is the method of reading magazines. A total of 28 essays are included, totaling 150,000 words. The language is simple, and the theory is thorough. Teachers and students of universities, middle schools, and primary schools, as well as young people with aspirations, should obtain a copy. The book is published by Youlian Publishing House at No. 1413, Xiafei Road, Shanghai, and distributed by the Local Humanistic Monthly. Local Life Bookstore, the author, and China Book and Magazine Company all sell the book.</p>

He is staying on the third floor of No. 12, Xinyongan Street, French Concession. It is heard that Mr. Liang's works do not use his hand to hold the brush, but he uses his mouth to bite the brush to write calligraphy and paint. He can write large characters in various styles and can paint up to four feet in size. Small characters can be written into a fan shape. He can also paint landscapes and figures with freehand ink orchids, which are the most wonderful. He has exhibited in Guangdong, Chaozhou, Meizhou, Shantou, and Fujian Province. Many celebrities from various places have given poems and inscriptions to welcome him.

<p>Shanghai Private Girls' Middle School 13th Anniversary Celebration Special Issue</p>
<h3>Commemorative Address</h3>
<p>— Chairman Wu Kaixian</p>
<p>Our school, from its founding to the present, has spanned thirty years. In these past thirty years, although various facilities have not reached our ideal state due to economic limitations, the number of young students from all over who come to study has increased year by year. The number of students this semester has reached 900, and their origins cover all provinces and cities in the country. At a time when women's education is not yet widespread, to have so many students disregard the distance and come here is a testament to the fact that our school has always been in a state of natural development, and therefore has been able to attract the close attention of people in the country! Now, our school is happily celebrating its 30th anniversary. All teachers and students have initiated a celebration meeting on the 30th of this month to show their joy; and to exhibit the achievements of the past three years, in order to seek criticism and guidance from people in society. We respectfully embrace the ancient teaching of thirty and stand, and briefly express our feelings to encourage the future.</p>
<p>First, running a school is a sacred social undertaking, and everyone knows the importance of its mission! Whether society is healthy or not depends entirely on the quality of school education. If the school has good education, then the young people who have been nurtured by good education will be healthy cells of the society and the country; if the school is not run well, and students are adversely affected, then these young people will be dangerous elements of the society and the country, and the impact on the future of the nation is extremely significant. Moreover, secondary education is a crucial key to the life of young people, which can not only make up for the shortcomings of primary education, but also lay the foundation for university education. Its importance is self-evident! General Moltke of Prussia once said: "The strength of Germany is due to the success of primary education!" It can be seen that the success or failure of school education is enough to influence the fate of the country. How can we not be careful about it? As we are at this 30th-anniversary celebration, looking ahead and looking back, we sincerely hope that all teachers and students will continue the spirit of serving the society in the past, strengthen the implementation of the school's original plan, work hard to make progress, create more healthy cells for the society, and cultivate more excellent talents for the country.</p>
<p>Second, we believe that women's education should focus on the cultivation of motherhood and the development of life skills. Because modern society is constituted by family organization; and the foundation of family organization lies in the relationship between spouses. If the relationship cannot be maintained permanently, or if motherhood cannot fulfill its responsibilities, it will be enough to cause family unrest and shake the foundation of social organization. Since the eastward spread of Europeanization, the country has been pursuing novelty in all aspects of life, marriage is regarded as a child's play, and the family is like a long journey. Thinking of this, I feel a thousand emotions! The ethics, morality, and life skills of the family are the fine threads that maintain the normal relationship between husband and wife. Whether for the benefit of the family or the happiness of the children, it depends on the maintenance of this bond. Therefore, we do not hesitate to loudly appeal to modern young people to be keenly aware of the sacredness of the spousal relationship and the importance of family responsibility, and today's women's education must pay attention to cultivating virtue and developing life skills, as a prelude to establishing a healthy family.</p>
<p>Third, Chinese women have always neglected the exercise of their own physical fitness, and the elders in the family have even more vague understanding of this. As a result, the willow waist and lotus steps are praised as beautiful stories. This kind of traditional misconception is the main reason for the weakness of the Chinese nation for thousands of years. Since motherhood is so weak, the children born must be misled by this congenital defect! In recent years, the government's education policy has actively promoted women's sports in order to strengthen the foundation of the country, but bad habits have not been eliminated, and promotion is difficult. I hope that all teachers and students of our school will actively promote it, so that everyone has a balanced development in intellectual, moral, and physical education. We cannot be satisfied with creating a few athletes.</p>
<p>The above three points are our minimum requirements. I think that under the leadership of Principal Tong, our school will be able to move steadily towards these three goals, and there is no need for us to elaborate.</p>
<h3>Honorary Chairman Mr. Wu Tiecheng</h3>
<h3>School Affairs Overview</h3>
<p>— Principal Tong Xingbai</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>I have been appointed as the principal of the school for three years. In these three years, I am very ashamed that I have made very few achievements due to the interaction between economic and environmental pressures. However, in order to develop women's education, in addition to expanding the school buildings, I have also worked hard to enrich the equipment and improve personnel affairs. Furthermore, thanks to the maintenance of people in the society and the false reputation of students from all over, the number of students in the recent two semesters has suddenly increased to more than 900, breaking a new record that has never been seen before. Although this point can be gratifying to the people in the society who love our school, it has also increased our responsibility in education. In the future, teachers and students of our school are willing to concentrate manpower and financial resources to seek development in both material and spiritual aspects, and expect to achieve greater achievements. Furthermore, we hope that people in the society and famous educators will help and supervise us with dual sympathy, so that we can reach the ideal level of women's education.</p>
<p>A. School History</p>
<p>Six years before the founding of the Republic of China, the five sisters of the Shanwang Su Benyan established our school in Shouli, Waiyuan, Xidou. In the second year of the Republic of China, they applied to the Shanghai County Government for land to build school buildings themselves at the intersection of Wenmiao Road, Ximen. In the sixteenth year, the school board of directors reorganized according to regulations and elected Wang Su Benyan as the principal. In the twentieth year, it was approved by the Municipal Education Bureau and filed with the Ministry of Education; in February of the twenty-third year, it was ordered by the Municipal Education Bureau to reorganize the school board of directors and appointed Xingbai as the principal, up to now, a total of thirty years. Before the 23rd year of our school, the school administration was not divided in detail, which inevitably made it difficult to handle affairs and develop. After the reorganization by the Bureau in the same year, the administrative system was established, the school regulations were revised, the training and education policies and development plans were determined; and new school buildings were built, equipment was enriched, discipline was rectified, and the level was improved. As a result, the number of applicants increased year by year from more than 300 to more than 900. On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the school, I will make a brief report on the current situation of school affairs and the improvement plan, and I hope that Chinese people will correct it.</p>
<p>B. General Affairs</p>
<p>(1) Equipment</p>
<p>Since the completion of the new school buildings, all the equipment of our school has not been completed. From the first semester of the third year of freedom, such as physics and chemistry instruments, books, repairs, sports, etc., special funds were stipulated and gradually added. Therefore, within three years, in addition to the original ones, statistics show that the addition of physics and chemistry, medicine, sports, scout equipment, books, etc., is no less than 10,000 yuan; in addition, a physics and chemistry laboratory and a toilet were built; two teacher bathrooms; one teacher and staff dormitory; one male and female worker dormitory; one library, one reading room, one school medical room, one recuperation room, and one storage room; and all the school desks and chairs were re-added according to the grade level and age. Other teaching tools and equipment are even more difficult to count. In the future, it should be gradually increased to make the equipment more perfect.</p>
<p>(2) School Buildings</p>
<p>The original school buildings of our school were 21 middle-seat buildings, 6 rear-seat buildings, and 4 bungalows. The front east side of the three-story building can only accommodate 400 to 500 students, which was originally insufficient. After the reorganization, a five-story new school building was rebuilt in the west bungalow in the third year of Gan. Since the last semester, the number of students has increased to more than 900. The number of classrooms has increased to 17 levels. Although the number of people has increased, fortunately, the space can be used, and unnecessary houses can be repaired and applied. If there is no active plan in the future to dominate the construction of the middle-seat building, it is feared that those who come to study will be crowded. The new school building is five stories high, and the bottom floor is divided into seven rooms for offices, the second, third, and fourth floors are divided into twelve classrooms, and the fifth floor is used as a flat top for students to relax. However, due to the large number of people, the open space is very insufficient. In addition to developing to the space, there is no possibility of expansion, which is not without regret.</p>
<h3>Chairman Mr. Wu Kaixian</h3>
<p>(3) Clearing School Debts</p>
<p>The school price of our school has reached 40,000 yuan before and after, accounting for almost half of the annual income, and it is quite difficult to maintain. Fortunately, the income and expenditure of previous sessions have tried to save money, in order to gradually pay off the school debts. As of this semester, more than 20,000 yuan has been repaid, and the remaining 10,000 yuan. If there are no other accidents, the repayment period should not be far away.</p>
<p>C. Academic Affairs</p>
<p>(1) Teaching Essentials</p>
<p>According to the educational purpose of the Republic of China and the provisions of Article 1 of the Secondary School Law promulgated by the National Government, the teaching essentials of our school are determined:</p>
<p>1. Use the Three Principles of the People to unify the thoughts and actions of young people;</p>
<p>2. Promote physical education to train a strong physique;</p>

<p>9. Develop a sense of responsibility for building a family and its necessary intelligence;</p>
<p>10. Develop a reasonable attitude and habits of social interaction.</p>
<p>(2) Adding Subjects</p>
<p>All teaching subjects of our school follow the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry in principle, but in order to consider the actual situation of the local area, for a few subjects, the weekly teaching hours are slightly increased or decreased according to the standards set by the Ministry; furthermore, for the preparation of students' employment, subjects such as primary school teaching methods and introduction to education are added to the second and third grades of senior high school.</p>
<p>(3) Academic Examination</p>
<p>The teaching of our school has always been strict. For the academic examination of students, there are academic examination regulations, divided into three types: daily examination, temporary examination, and semester examination; and in order to pay attention to students' daily academic performance, the academic affairs office collects, inspects, and stamps students' papers and homework in stages to show solemnity, so that students pay close attention to their own homework and develop diligent learning habits. Furthermore, calligraphy, Chinese, Chinese and English papers, mathematics, natural science and other tests and competitions are held within the semester, and there are various competition methods to supplement the shortcomings of daily examinations.</p>
<p>(4) Future Plans</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of students in our school has increased by leaps and bounds, so there should be continuous improvement in terms of quality. Therefore, the teaching facilities, such as the library, prayer room, music room, etc., are planned to be expanded; for scientific instruments, it is also planned to add a large number of them, so that all teaching supplies are enriched and perfected. As for subjects, it is also planned to add subjects such as applied bookkeeping, typing, cooking, housekeeping, and sewing within the possible scope, in order to prepare students for employment and family management.</p>

<h3>Principal Mr. Tong Xingbai</h3>
<h3>Part of the Awards and Prizes Won by Our School in the Past Three Years</h3>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>— (Tang Zenggeng)</p>
<p>Love, it's not calling you to sincerely indulge in the embrace of people you love, being muddleheaded all day long, it's not calling you to raise the banner of "love" and look down on everyone on the battlefield of love. Of course, it's not calling you to forget everything for the sake of love; love, in fact, is asking you to love the public, love society, and love your country. You should use love in a broad sense to cover up love in a narrow sense. Only love in a broad sense is the instinct that everyone should have.</p>
<p>Indeed, young people cannot do without the comfort of love, just like a barren garden hoping to be irrigated, but please open your eyes and take a look: how many have returned from the battlefield of love with triumph? How many have fallen into the sea of ​​suffering forever? Do you hope to grab victory from the middle of love? Or do you hope to get bitter juice from the middle of love? There are two avenues in front of you, and you need to choose for yourself.</p>
<p>Young people who take love as life, please wake up, is this a time to talk about love exclusively? Is there a sharp steel knife on your head? Are there fierce enemies in front and behind? The circle of love will not let you indulge in it all day long. You should use your sword of wisdom to cut off the thread of love, and you should also cut off the deep love and tenderness of your lover at all costs.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Blowing Artist</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Those who knead flour figures are praised by literati as nameless street artists, and seem to have a very long history. But it seems that no literati have ever mentioned the art of sugar blowers.</p>
<p>In the places where civilians live, especially in slums, the footprints of these sugar blowers can often be seen. The burden of sugar blowers is similar to that of flour figure makers. Two crossed frames support a wooden box, which is the workplace. On the wooden box, a firewood broom stands upright, which is used to hedgehog together the various toys that have been blown up. When this kind of worker stops his burden, or in the process of working, after a considerable amount of time, when he hits the broken small gong a few times, children always gather around in front of him, looking with greedy eyes, and realizing that this kind of fun thing is sure to be sweet. However, sugar blowers are not only welcomed by children, but adults also stop and marvel at the superbness of their art.</p>
<p>If flour figure makers are praised as street artists, then sugar blowers seem to deserve it even more. Because although flour figure makers have superb skills, they are still inevitably suspected of piling up and piecing together, while sugar blowers can arbitrarily pull out a thread from a whole piece of sugar, and from this thin thread, blow air into the whole piece of sugar, so that the sugar swells up. More use of skilled techniques to make this swollen sugar into chickens, ducks, cats, and dogs. Those with more refined skills can even blow out the shapes of female students, red-headed foreigners, etc. Although it is exquisite, it is not up to the products of flour figure makers. However, if we look at it with the eyes of the twentieth century, the products of sugar blowers have a simple color, rough and neat lines, and majestic contours, which seem to have some flavor of so-called post-impressionism. But this is just saying so, it is bound to be regarded as a madman to talk about these things for this kind of street vendor.</p>
<p>Recently, I was chatting with a sugar blower, and I learned that it is not easy to eat this bowl of rice. It takes two or three years of practice to learn the skill of blowing air from sugar threads. After learning the skill of blowing air, you learn to blow simple things such as small bedpans and water pipes. After learning dozens of kinds, you can come out to sell your skills and cheat money. Although they don't have a guild of peers, it is said that there is absolutely no one who doesn't know how to blow a dozen kinds of toys. Generally, those with poor skills are active in various parts of the inland. In large cities such as Shanghai, it is not uncommon for those who make a living by blowing sugar to be able to blow twenty or thirty kinds of toys. Those with high skills can blow whatever they see. However, this is not a aristocratic thing after all, so it is said that the best income is only half a dollar a day. Fortunately, most of these people are farmers from various parts of northern Jiangsu. During the slack season, they come to various places in Jiangsu and Shanghai with their families and use this as a sideline, so although the income is small, it is not a serious problem.</p>
<p>But from a hygienic point of view, sugar blowers, the things they blow up, children, as delicious sugar food, when we try to close our eyes and think about it, how dangerous is it?</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<h3>The Future Position of the Western Mediterranean</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>According to yesterday's London Times, the Spanish Civil War incident is felt here that Rome has broken the neutrality agreement. The Manchester Guardian claims that the current Spanish war is no longer a civil war. The future position of the western Mediterranean has become a problem. Indeed, the Spanish war is nominally a civil war, but in fact, it is already a foreign war, which is already a well-known fact. However, can this kind of foreign war be gradually eliminated due to this non-interference in the Spanish Civil War monitoring plan, or will it be expanded even more as a result? This is a very important issue at present!</p>
<p>The leader of the Spanish rebels is General Franco, but this general is completely a puppet, and the one who is manipulating behind the scenes is someone else, who is about to be called out. Therefore, this Spanish war is more appropriate to say that it is a war between fascists and non-fascists than to say it is a civil war and a foreign war. So far, the Spanish Civil War has been going on for several months, and it is still advancing and retreating like sawing wood, and the outcome is undecided. The most suffering are the Spanish people, whose lives and property are sacrificed, which is difficult to calculate in numbers. The result is only that both gamblers are betting as a last resort. What is it for in Spain?</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought of the Spanish Civil War. Although it is a contest arena between fascists and non-fascists, it is ultimately because of the misfortune of the country that the rebellious elements and ambitious jackals emerged, which led to the intrusion of foreign forces. Assuming that there is no such person as General Franco in the country, then even if foreign forces want to intrude, they cannot intrude. As the saying goes, "The fence is broken and wild dogs drill in." This is indeed a great misfortune for Spain, but according to the current situation, it has become such a stalemate. Not only can Spain not clean up itself, but even those who help the murderers cannot clean up for a while.</p>
<p>Now, the British and French countries, in view of the Spanish Civil War, have a great tendency to prolong and expand, so they launched the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War and stipulated the sea and land monitoring plan, indicating that everyone is not allowed to go to help any aspect of the Spanish Civil War. Assuming that this plan can be implemented and effective, it is a great opportunity to quell the matter. However, this plan is naturally approved by the non-fascist side, while the fascist Germany is pretending to be foolish. Without making a statement, Italy is very active, and has a tendency to not give up until Spain is razed to the ground. Because Italy's help to the rebels is already not small. According to Russian reports, there are as many as 60,000 Italian troops entering Spain. Italy uses such a huge force, but it cannot overthrow the government, and it is also a bit embarrassing in terms of face.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is intentionally and passively in the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War, and has always maintained a stance of welcoming and rejecting. However, this sea and land military monitoring plan cannot achieve considerable results, and it is likely to turn the Spanish Civil War into a world war. I am very afraid of it.</p>
<h3>Abandoned City</h3>
<p>— Ya Min</p>
<p>At dusk, I climbed onto the top of the Manchurian city wall, standing amidst the broken ramparts and ruined battlements, overlooking the crumbling buildings of the previous dynasty. The blood-red sunset engulfed the entire city, and I felt as if I were standing in the ruins after the Great Fire of Rome, lamenting the city's past prosperity.</p>
<p>Where has the prosperity of only a few decades ago gone? Now, no matter how hard I look, I cannot find a single house that is even slightly intact. There are no streets, no shops; the remains of houses lie horizontally, crushing the bluestone pavements. It's suppertime, but not a wisp of smoke rises from the city. Houses have their roofs torn off, exposing their chests to the desolate wind, like abandoned coffins without lids. Stray dogs can enter the inner rooms at any time, without having to go through the door, and leisurely lift their hind legs to urinate beside the broken pillars and abandoned stoves. In the shady corners of the houses, lush green grass grows.</p>
<p>What about the residents of this city? Women strolling leisurely on the streets, smoking long pipes; men who love snuff, receiving royal rations since birth. Where have these conquerors gone now? Not even a grave remains. Only an old beggar leans against a half-ruined wall, taking off his tattered jacket to catch fleas, while a mangy dog licks the sores on his leg. I know him; the children call him "Old Manchu." It is said that he was once a "Baturu warrior." Now, this unworthy descendant has lost the glory of his ancestors, relying on the pity of his former slaves to survive. The story of his ancestors conquering the world with thirteen horses carrying thirteen suits of armor is now a bygone glory for him.</p>
<p>The lonely flagpole of the Commandant's Office stares sadly at the remnants of the mansion beneath its feet, accompanied by the nearly collapsing gate tower. Now, only it still stands tall, supporting the dignity of the past. But eroded by time and wind and rain, its aging body is also becoming increasingly thin. The wind of the northern lands is fickle; who knows when it will shake and fall down, allowing a wood-gathering child to end its final fate. Now, in the fading sunlight, it blushes and tells old dreams to the clouds. There is also no display of the yellow dragon flag on the bare pole.</p>
<p>Or perhaps the flagpole can still point out: in this city, that was the Beizi's mansion, that was the Banner camp. Cavalrymen wearing red-tasseled hats galloped through the bustling market, the opera house was filled with noisy voices, and the teahouses were crowded with people drinking tea. But now it has become a desolate field of sand and gravel, with a thin wisp of evening smoke rippling between the broken and ruined walls.</p>
<p>Dusk rises along the city walls, and I stagger down the city wall. At the deep city gate, the faithful old gatekeeper is already waiting there. I greet him as usual.</p>
<p>"Are you closing the city gate?"</p>
<p>"Don't you want to play a little longer? Actually, this city gate doesn't need to be closed anymore." The old man smiled bitterly, a sigh disappearing into his pale beard. I saw an unconquerable loneliness on the old man's face, comparing the past and present.</p>
<p>Silently walking out of the city, the creaking sound of the city gate cuts off my lingering gaze.</p>
<h3>On the Road</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>In the melancholy and uncertain autumn, when you not only cannot see the sun but also cannot feel its warmth, and even forget about it, it is common to get lost in the autumn forest. You are pulled off the main road, lose all the small paths, and get tired of searching for them. You grit your teeth and step straight into the dense forest ahead, crossing rotten trees knocked down by the wind, and crossing rugged, muddy mounds! Finally, you will often find a main road!</p>
<p>Every time I feel disappointed about a thorny matter, I always lie in bed, watching the gray ceiling with both eyes, or watching how the flowing clouds in the sky change and move, finally sighing wearily, and thinking back to that thorny matter.</p>
<p>In our family, sighing is not allowed. The elders will sternly ask you: "Why are you sighing when you are so young?" They reward a person for walking with their chest out, not being timid at all. Naturally, it is the same on the long road of life. However, I often sigh, having learned many sentences from Turgenev's essays and novels, such as: smoke, what is not smoke! ... While young, I lived very melancholically, but I also loved spring and liveliness. I walked on such a contradictory, muddy road.</p>
<p>Later, I read Gorky's books, was educated by the stories in his books, joined new rivers, and lived a new life. But I was still often tired, sitting by the roadside, holding my head in my hands, letting the cold night wind blow. Gorky, this brilliant linguist, the great technician of the human soul, said the words above. —"...you will often find a main road."</p>
<p>So, I walked again.</p>
<p>Oh, this rugged, muddy road, where is the end? While looking forward, I lift this foot and put it down, and then laboriously lift that one...</p>
<p>When walking on the road, I don’t know how many people come over to talk to you, they use various different ways, say different things, and say it very definitely, as if only his road is correct:</p>
<p>“Young man! This road is endless, on this road, there is fear and distress, although some people say that at the end there is sunshine and warm spring breeze, but how many people have you seen reach the end? — Those who say it is happy there are all dead now.” As he spoke, he took out a painting from his pocket, which depicted a green field, and young men and women were happily playing on the field. He said: "You should stop, you can live happily here for the rest of your life." However, he would not allow me to look at the back of the painting, because there was a skull on it.</p>
<p>Then another person came over and said:</p>
<p>“Young man: It is a very admirable thing for you to pursue the sun and pursue the light, but haven’t you seen that in front, behind, I don’t know how many people have died, the land you are stepping on is built of their blood, flesh, and bones. This is a very difficult thing.” He pretended to care about me and said to me: “You should walk according to the method I pointed out to you, because those who died were too good at resisting, and they were too good at using their hands and feet. If a tree branch blocks his way, he will definitely destroy it, and if a small worm bites his foot, he will step on it, so that when he encounters a big storm, he will die in the dark deep river! You have to walk slowly, if someone blocks you, ignore him, sit down and rest for a while, if someone drags you and doesn’t let you go, or wants you to retreat a few miles, just lie down and have a good rest!</p>
<p>“Then, sir, haven’t you seen the blood-lettered monument by the roadside? It contains the words of people from the past: Young man, catch up! Remove all obstacles, and the end will arrive!</p>
<p>“That’s calling you to send your life quickly!”</p>
<p>I ignored him and kept walking forward. All kinds of nagging words kept stopping me, stubbornly talking to me. Their mouths seemed to be made of iron, and they were not afraid of being worn out.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an old man with rapid breathing lies by the side of the road, he says:</p>
<p>"Young man, walk faster, the end is coming — I'll catch up with you as soon as I catch my breath! ... Don't stop, it's just ahead!"</p>
<p>The gentlemen by the roadside laugh coldly and say: "Look, this old man is flattering the young man—he wants the young man to commemorate him when he reaches the end, hold a memorial service, or take him over to take care of him in his old age!" They proudly put on a noble air and laughed! Their hands and feet danced wildly, and they even turned their heads back to make faces.</p>
<p>The road is long, as if there is no end in sight... However, I finally saw the bright flags erected by the people who had already arrived waving in the spring breeze, and the happy songs over there were constantly floating over... People are waving enthusiastically at me, stretching out their thick arms, waiting for me to run over and give me a long embrace!</p>
<p>However, the road is difficult to walk, on this wet autumn road filled with fog, isn't there a ferocious bull coming to sting your flesh, a tree branch pulling on your clothes, a muddy road making you slip and fall, people laughing at your nose being ugly, your eyes not as beautiful as his, your height not as majestic as his, ... then, just ignore everything, crush all obstacles, fall and get up again, and take brave steps forward! "You grit your teeth and step straight into the dense forest ahead, crossing rotten trees knocked down by the wind, crossing rugged, muddy mounds — finally, you will often find a main road!" Moreover, someone has already reached the end of that road, they are waving to you, singing, preparing to embrace you...</p>
<p>Looking back at the thousands of people following you, walking in the same direction as you! ... Forward!</p>
<h3>Hometown</h3>
<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>Sending a friend abroad, I boarded a large steamship crossing the Pacific Ocean for the first time, on a certain early spring evening.</p>
<p>The huge iron maze was magnificent, and many noble foreigners came and went like shuttles, but in a corner, I saw a ragged compatriot, his greasy long gown shining under the brilliant ship lights.</p>
<p>He glanced at us sharply, and then immediately chased after</p>
