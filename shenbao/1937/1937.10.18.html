<h3>我外部復比政府希望九國公約會議成功</h3>
<p>俾依正義恢復遠東和平　美亦正式聲明參加會議　並派幹練代表積極行動</p>
<p>［南京］九國公約會議定於本月三十日在比京開幕、已由比國駐華代辦向我國致送請柬、交部外長王寵惠當於昨日電覆、略稱“中國政府接受比國政府之邀請、并希望會議成功、使遠東和平、得依據國際公約及正義、迅速重行建立”云、（十七是中央社電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］美國茲已正式接受比政府邀請、出席於十月三十日在比京召集之九國公約會議、美代表團人員亦已派定、定於本月二十日乘“華盛頓”號輸船自紐約東渡、聞美國參加會議之最初目的、爲促成中日兩國所“同意的和平”、消息靈通方面以下列兩種環境觀察、俱信美國在會議中、將採取一種堅强立塲、㊀美國對於比政府之邀請迅速加以接受、不問會議之參加者、是否限於九國公約簽字國及德蘇之被邀請與否、㊁美國代表團人員極爲堅强嚴整、聞美政府對於何國參加會議、並不十分着重、任何國家之願加人中日衝突之調解工作者、美國均有與之合作之準備云、國務卿赫爾稱、據彼所知、該會議第一次會議、大約將限於九國公約之簽字國云、下爲美國接受邀請之復文、“美國國務卿茲特向比利時大使致敬、並鄭重接受大使本年十月十六日之來函、內開、比利時政府、承英政府之請求及美政府之同意、特建議一九二二年二月六日所訂條約之各簽字國、定於十有卅日在白魯塞爾舉行會議、藉以遵照該約第七條、審査遠東局勢、並研究該處殊屬遣憾之衝突、有何迅速和平解决之方法、美政府茲謹欣然接受其邀請、並已由總統擇定台維斯君爲美國之代表”、（中央社十六日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國務部長赫爾今日宣布、美國已接受比國之邀請、凖備於十有三十日出席比京九國肥約會議、比國邀請書中並未說明、此次會議僅九國公約之簽字國出席、抑將邀請凱洛非戰公約簽字國共同參加、赫氏並稱、彼尙未知會議之議程、美國代表團在出發之前、亦未必再向羅期福總統請訓、政府方面消息靈通者稱、此次美國出席九國公約會議、將爲參加凡爾賽和約以來、對於國外局勢最積極之行動、美國代表團之出發、如此迅速，足見羅斯福總統欲使九國公約會議於國會特別會議開幕以前’至少有相當之决定、同時總統亦欲於日本軍隊在華北方面尙無進一步之發展以前、卽能决定應取之行動、外交界咸信、第一步當爲請求中日兩國暫時休戰、此種交涉、台維斯特使最爲勝任云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國務卿赫爾頃發表談話稱關於九國公約會議之請柬、頃已於今晨送達國務院、美國政府業已加以接受、美國首席代表台維斯特使將於下星期中遄赴比國、啟程之前、當由羅斯福總統接見、面授機宜、此外代表團尙有參贊兩員、卽國務院顧問前遠東司司長洪佩克·與國務院歐洲司司長摩爾·及情報專員卽國務院歐洲司帮辦司長貝爾與秘書卽歐洲司科員鮑倫、（中央社十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福總統昨在海德公園城向各報記者發表談話、說明九國公約會議任務、總統當時曾勸各報記者、對於美國政策未來發展情形、不必加以揣測、此其用意、乃在再度說明美國政策、純以時局形勢爲轉移、羅斯福總統並曾表示空氣若果良好、美國政府或凖備在中日兩國之間出任調解、一般人因而相信、九國公約會議美國首席代表台維斯所奉訓令、卽在首先覓取委協方式之基礎、消息靈通人士、對於會議前途成功希望、並不過份表示樂觀、至若此項會議、不能覓獲妥恊方式、卽將產生何種情勢、國務院方面亦已加以考盧、緣美國政府、仍願各國出以共同行動、以解决中日糾紛、特未擬有詳細方案耳、美國官塲人士並謂、地中海現行緊張局勢、雖與美國並無直接關係、但必須地中海問題解决之後、美國在遠東方面如何與各國合作一項政策、始可以確定、質言之、倫敦調整會開會結果、歐洲緊張局勢倘能爲之緩和、則遠東方面解决糾紛之希望、自必因而加强云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］美國政府頗欲南美洲某某數國參加九國公約會議、并曾非正式提出此項建議、或有達到目的之可能云、（中央社十六日哈瓦斯電）⊙白魯塞爾比國消息靈通人士頃宣稱、九國公約會議開幕之後、當先就遠東時局作普泛之檢討、并决定九國公約非簽字國中何國應邀其參加會議、立卽發出請柬、然後宣吿延會、至十一月上旬再行開會、俾非簽字國被邀參加者、得在延會期間、指派代派前來出席云、（中央社十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>九國公約會議日本進退兩難</h3>
<p>出席與否內閣意見紛歧　俄德亦將被邀參加會議</p>
<p>［巴黎］中國駐法大使顧維鈞左右人土頃宣稱、日本或將出席九國公約會議、亦未可必、此外、參加會議各國大約將於本月三十日會議開幕之前、向蘇德兩國發出請柬、蘇聯應允參加、自不成問題、至於德國態度、則將以日本之態度爲轉移、據聞德國因在中國保有重大利益、現正設法促使日本參加、俾德國亦得出席、關於此層、法國一般人士以爲、德國並未公然爲日本聲援、如意國所爲、故九國公約會議頗有成爲一種和平會議之可能、目前歐洲各大國外交界以爲、日本内閣對於參加九國公約會議一層、態度並不一致、各閣員凡與參謀本部接近者、對於在擊破中國軍隊之前、凡足以弛緩軍事行動之議、均加以反對、因而不願參加九國公約會議、其他閣員則恐戰事若果延長、將在經濟上發生惡劣影響、爰乃主張參加九國公約會議、希望獲得有利的停戰條件、兩派相持、尙無成議、英法兩國消息靈通人士則以爲、中國外交行動、雖以蔣委員長前所提出之最低限度條件爲根據、但各國或將出而調解、因而中日兩國間覓獲妥恊基礎、非不可能、至若日本拒不參加九國公約會議、則中國目必乘機設法削弱日本在外交上之地位、中國現雖深知國聯會各會員國反對制裁日本、但若戰事賡續進行、則中國仍望禁止煤油運往日本一項辦法、得以付諸實施、故中國外交行動、將以此項辦法爲首要目標、截至目前爲止、國聯會之壓力並非完全無效、卽如國聯大會譴責日本飛機轟炸中國未設防務各城市一舉、已在日本軍事當局方面發生多少影響、而國聯大會在精神上援助中國一項决定、亦使日本國內溫和派地位爲之增强、所望該派人士勢力逐漸增長、俾各國所可進行之調解行動、得以收效耳、（中央社十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］時報頃評論九國公約會議前途、略調此非對日本發動戰事之謂、更非將中日糾紛擴大爲國際糾紛之謂、日本政府曾再聲明、對於中國并無領土野心、九國公約會議之作用、即在以證實此項誠意之機會、給予日本、該國政府雖迭次表示中日兩國糾紛、不容第三國干涉、但日本係九國公約簽字國、按之該公約第七條、簽約各國原有交換意見之規定、然則召集九國公約會議、絕非干涉之謂、日本拒不參加、殊無理山可言也要之、日本倘不欲與太平洋問題贊遠東問題有關各國、明白决裂、并自認爲侵略國、則爲該國本身利益計、參加九國公約會議、以覓取解决方案、實乃計之得者云、（中央社十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>我國對布魯塞爾會議應取之態度</h3>
<p>— 沈□□</p>
<p>根據本月六日國聯大會决議而召集的九國公約簽字國會議，已决定本月三十日在比京布魯塞爾舉行。會議的主角之一美國，且已正式派定羅斯福的親信駐歐特使台維斯爲首席代表，卽日赴歐與會·英國的首席代表聞亦內定以外相艾登擔任。同時，世界各國的政治家，輿論界，和民衆團體，這幾天都聚精會神地期待着這會議的到來，熱烈地表示着他們對於這會議的期望。於此可見，九國公約簽字國會議，雖其任務只限於調解中日衝突，而其意義之大，實是及於全世界的。</p>
<p>我們，爲九國公約之中心對象的我們，對於這一直接有關我抗戰前途和遠東安全的重大會議，當然應出以特別愼重和警惕的態度，庶不致貽誤我百萬前綫浴血戰士和億萬後方抗敵民衆誓以决死力爭的偉大事業的前途。</p>
<p>要確定對於九國公約會議的態度，我們必先對它有一個明確的認識。</p>
<p>我們知道，這次國聯的建議召集九國公約會議和美國的積極贊助此會，是最近一個月來全世界各國，特別是英，美，法，蘇諸國爲反對侵略暴行，擁護正義和平而同情我國的諸種表現之一。這些表現之最顯赫者，有如美總統在芝加哥及以後的幾次演說，美國務院指斥日本破壞條約實行侵略的重要聲明，英國朝野之普遍的制日運動，英相張伯倫的擁護和平制止暴行的演說，以及國聯大會之正式譴責日本侵犯中國，違反九國公約與非戰公約的建議。這樣，這次日內瓦和華盛頓的一致合作，主開九國公約會議以解决遠東目前的緊張局勢，我們見於友邦存着愛護和平唾棄侵略的美意，不辭辛勞，不畏艱難地出來調解，我們當然頗爲感奮；因而我們毫不躊躇地接受邀請，凖備出席。</p>
<p>這次美國和國聯（主要的是英國的斷然合作，當然由於雙方急需恢復遠東和平，制止侵略者的獨覇企圖，以維護英美在華的原有利益。淞滬戰爭開始後，日寇變本加厲地橫行，不斷地威脅和侵犯英美諸國在華的權益，同時又外激於我全國上下團結禦侮，堅决抗戰的精神，內迫於如火如荼的民衆反日運動的威勢，於是華盛頓和日內瓦排斥侵略主持正義的聲浪，就大響而特響了；召開九國公約簽字國會議的建議，就立卽被通過了。</p>
<p>從法理上講，美國旣已正式宣佈日本的行爲爲侵略，國聯旣已决議譴責日本侵犯中國和破壞九國非戰二約，那末它們用行動來制裁暴日和援助中國，確已有了堅實的法理基礎。但是事實上却距這一步遠得很。我們絕對不能依據上述諸種事實而對布魯塞爾會議，遽抱過分的樂觀；相反的，根據這幾天的各種消息，我們不但不能對會議存任何奢望（當然更不能存絲毫的依賴心），而且應當大大地警惕起來，全國一致凖備作堅决的應付！</p>
<p>首先要指出，英美兩國是否已眞正一致精誠合作，是大成問題的。牠們各因不同的利害關係，始終互相推諉，互相觀望。單爲會議召集人和地點的問題，雙方就推諉得很厲害。最近美國負責方面對羅斯福廣播演說之解釋中，有謂‘若九國公約調解不成，則美國自當進一步考慮實際辦法，如與日本斷絕商務關係……但美國政府必先獲得保證，卽美國中止對日貿易之後，他國不得乘機取而代之’（十三日哈瓦斯電）。這顯然是在對英國說話。</p>
<p>在另一方面，從召開九國公約會議和英美合作的消息傳來後，日本外務省卽堅决表示决不參加。同時，日軍又加緊對英國利益最大的地方（廣州，珠江口，粵漢和廣九兩路）不斷濫施轟炸。日前在閔行公路上空，敵機又故意對英大使館汽車掃射。同時歐洲方面，牠的難兄難弟又對英法建議自西國撤退志願軍的談判加以拒絕，且公然續派援軍赴西，這難保不是侵略陣綫外交把戲的表演，旨在牽制英法。英國的紳士們，處這層層威迫之下，於是一面暗中設法緩和東京的情緖，一面張伯倫公開演說，表示‘對遠東戰事，有迅速加以解决的熱望’，這是迎合日本‘速戰速决’之要求的。再則謂‘英國之態度自來未有如今日之和緩者’；英國民族之天性，素不懷恨於人，與任何國家相爭，事後卽能釋怨和好…’。這些表示，跟前日美國務院的非正式警吿：‘九國公約會議未必能立卽解决中日紛，：美國不望以國際捷徑恢復和平’，也顯然是不一致的。</p>
<p>退一步講，就算英美兩國對於解决中日爭端的態度已完全一致，我們對布魯塞爾會議仍不能存若何奢望。因爲英美當局業已一再聲明，此次會議的惟一任務在於‘調停爭端’。旣然是爲了‘調停爭端’那末英美等國當然以調人自居；牠們旣是調人，當然對於中日雙方都不好得罪。這樣一來，試問還談得到制裁侵略嗎？事實上，這種‘調停’工作英國早就在暗中進行。國聯决議案中始終不將‘侵略’二字列入；在遠東有特別密切關係而爲國聯常任理事的蘇聯，迄未被邀參加；張伯倫日前發表‘和緩’與‘睦鄰’的演說；凡此種種，何一而非‘調停’行爲的表現？最可注意的，是日本外務省發言人，正在這時，突然由先前的‘决不參加’一改而爲‘有參加之可能’了。而且參加的條件，彷彿只是不加以‘侵略國之戳記’（這是調人們早已做到了的，何必再裝腔作勢的提這一句？）。看起來日本的參加會議是很可能的了。</p>
<p>自然，從法理上講，我們沒有反對日本參加之理由與必要。但是就事論事，日本的接受邀請，一定是有利可圖而來的。而日本的有利，必然是我們的不利。在華北已打得差不多，在淞滬需要保全面子而下台的今日，日本確是願意‘調停’的。但是這樣的調停，對於我們是萬分不利的。這樣的調停就是用和平方式來逼我們‘屈膝’！對於這種調停，我們除繼續加强殺敵到底外，不應有第二個答復！</p>
<p>實際上，布魯塞爾會議本來是爲了日本破壞九國公約和武力侵略中國而召集的，那末它的中心任務，就無疑地應該是恢復九國公約和制止侵略。而九國公約的第一條便是‘尊重中國主權獨立及領土與行政之完整’，那末九國公約會議不開則巳，一開就非做到恢復全部中國領土與行政之完整不可；換句話講就非恢復‘九一八’以前的狀態不可。這是布魯塞爾會議所應努力的中心目標，也是我們所要誓死力爭的和平條件。</p>
<p>總之，這次會議如有損害我們絲毫領土主權的决定，我們定當誓死反對。我們積極地主張這次會議成爲眞正集體安全制的機構，用集體的行動去制裁侵略，而不應用‘和事老’的面孔去企圖‘調停爭端’！只有這樣，遠東和世界的眞正和平，纔有保障。</p>

<h3>在轟炸中來去</h3>
<p>— 郭沫若</p>
<p>九</p>
<p>季惺的家在P路某號，是一座二層樓的洋房。前庭的一片草坪裏已經掘有兩個防空壕，但當她帶我上樓時，還指着屋外正對面的一個土丘，高與樓窗齊手的，對我說：我們在那土山下，還因山掘了一個土壕，上面的浮土有兩丈多厚，一有警報來，我們便跑進那兒去躲避。</p>
<p>接着又把警吿的方式告訴我，據說是用哨子。當有敵機來時便有第一次的警報，敵機逼近了，便有第二次的緊急警報。第一次警報來時便當作避難凖備，第二次警報來時便一律都進防空壕。等到敵機走遠了，又來一次哨子是警號解除的表示。</p>
<p>聽着這些話覺得有點像童話般的滋味，因爲住在租界裏的人是從沒有經受過這樣的訓練的。</p>
<p>把住處搬定了，爲接見朋友，訪問朋友，便忙了一天，有一位同鄕誇講我，說我的成績很好，別的人就費十天工夫都怕把‘關係’打不好的，我一天工夫就打好了。這誇講，不知道是該我接受，還是該朋友們來接受。</p>
<p>午後四點鐘的時候，打電話給張岳軍，向他報了到。他在電話裏面便請我到他的公館裏去談話。</p>
<p>投刺後，被引進了一間客廳。</p>
<p>岳軍穿着藍色的緞袍子走了出來，彼此拉了手。</p>
<p>——十年不見了。擊整十年啦。……馬伯援以前常見面，談起你，說你的生活很淸苦。……又曾提起，想約朋友們多量地贈送些書籍給你，供你的研究。但我是担心，恐怕你不肯接受。……賓眷怎樣呢？近來有消息嗎？</p>
<p>沒有十分改盡的四川鄕音，娓娓地談着。</p>
<p>——今年五月，在廬山，和慕尹，公洽，淬廉諸位談起了你，大家都想把你請回來。但關於取消通緝的事情，不免躊躇了一下：因爲如果早取消了，恐怕你不能離開日本吧。</p>
<p>聽着這些開心見腸的話，眞是使找感激，我沒想出有這麽多的朋友關切我。不過朋友們也似乎把我估計得太高，其實我的生活雖‘苦’，並不怎麽‘淸’，苦得實在是有點焦頭爛額的。已經是過往的事了，不妨在這兒說一說。</p>
<p>記得在八年前中國錢最賤的時候，有一個時期，三塊大洋勉强可以換得日本一圓。在那時儘管運着一枝筆，從早寫到晚，寄回中國去賣的中國錢僅僅只能掉換得少數的日本老頭票。一家六口一月靠着四五十圓的老頭票（約當留東學生的一個人的平均生活費）過活下去的，也有好幾個月。</p>
<p>最使不能忘記的，是我的一部‘兩周金文辭大系’，費了兩年的工夫研究出來的成果，寫信給商務印書館求售，遭了拒絕。求燕京大學，求中央研究院，也同樣地沒有發生影響。沒有辦法，只好去求日本東京的一家書店，書店老板却只肯給我三百圓的板稅。我嫌少了一點，因爲那種書是很難望再版的。老板說：要曉得啦，三百圓等於中國錢七百多塊啦。這話雖然有點傷我的尊嚴，然而却也刺中了我自己的最軟弱的要害。自已雖然遲疑了半個月，然而畢竟還是抱了那部書去換了三百元老頭票到手。從此，我的關於考古一方面的著作也就接一連二地在日本印出了。於是西圓寺公爵對我怎樣怎樣，日本政府又對我怎樣怎樣的謠諑便在國內傳播了起來，險些兒沒有把我定成漢奸’。</p>
<p>僅僅隔着一個東中國海，我們對於日本的認識，不知道何以覓隔膜得那樣。我可以坦白地再說幾句話。西園寺公爵看過我的書是事實，看後向人稱讚過也是事實，但他和我並沒有一絲一毫的直接的關係。我不願意借他來抬高我的身價，我也不願意拿我去抬高他的身價。他固然是日本的元老，而且是値得尊敬的一位國際政治家，然而說到古器物學的研究上，他究竟只是我的愛讀者而已。</p>
<p>說到日本的官吏，日本的學者們，他們最初只把我看成的落水鷄，把我的著作看成水中的鷄糞，然而待到他們的元老稱讚，西歐的學術界也生出了反響的時候，他們便刮起目來了。眞眞是透頂的勢利！</p>
<p>勢利的民族，我怕日本人要算是世界第一·一些研究中國學問的所謂‘支那學者’，連中國文都還讀不斷句，而他們的心目中却澈底地藐視中國人。但一遇着西方‘支那學者’的橫行文字的著作時，却奉若拱璧；五體投地，不是‘馬斯伯樂（Maspelo）曰’，便是‘卡爾格倫（Karlgren）云，’這和日本軍部在上海散傳單，聲明要打中國共產黨，而同時日本的天皇却在歡讌蘇聯大使，不正是同一國民性的表露嗎？</p>
<p>——我近來簡直專門在做秘書長了。仍然是岳軍在對我說。</p>
<p>——怎的？</p>
<p>——喏，政治會議的秘書長是我，××××的秘書長是我，軍事委員會的秘書長又是我。一個人兼任三個秘書長。</p>
<p>我覺得中國的人才太少，能者太勞了，聽了岳軍的話，我這樣想，但沒有說出來。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>根除失敗主義思想</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>近日各綫戰事的勝利。使國人對於抗戰前途的樂觀心理。增强了不少。可是我們還不能不警覺失敗主義思想並沒有從我全國同胞中間絕跡。</p>
<p>我國是被侵略者被壓迫者。一向把弱點暴露着。而把優點隱藏。着敵國則是侵略者。壓迫者一向把優點顯露着。而把弱點隱藏着。因此皮毛的常識往往向我一般同胞提示着。我們是戰不過敵國的。這就是失敗主義思想的根源。</p>
<p>失敗主義思想不但危害着國家。而且毒害着自身眼前最顯明的例證。在文官方面有黃濬的賣情報而授首。在武官方面有李服膺的棄要地而伏誅。這兩人要不是深中了失敗主義思想的流毒。當然不會有那樣的結果的。</p>
<p>反過來說。只要能够克除失敗主義思想。則一時的失敗。也就是日後更大的勝利。試看南口羅團的全團殉國。寶山姚營的全營陣亡。表面上似乎都不能不說是失敗。其實那麼壯烈的犧牲。對於國家的貢獻是無比地偉大的。且不說敵人在南口寶山消耗了多大的實力。就是目前晋省戰局之所以好轉。淞滬防綫之所以鞏固。也顯然全仗戰爭初期。那些英勇的將士們至死不退的壯烈精神。</p>
<p>願全國同胞深切了解這次抗戰在根本的意義上就是民族革命。而革命的信條只有勝利沒有失敗。隨時隨地遇到什麼失敗主義思想萌動起來。非竭全力來根除不可。</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>此次我國長期抗戰。原出於敵人所不及料。敵人所預料者。如下是已。</p>
<p>華北方面。旣用政治手腕。或恐嚇手段。業已妥恊。無煩用兵。而中央方面。則有黃秋岳之流。時輸情報。和平空氣。十分濃厚。不主用兵。至於淞滬方面。則以重兵壓境卽有戰事。亦可數小時或一二日而解决。并且深知我國各方。精神並不團結。实力並不充足。固囊中物也。所以敵人此次侵略我國。認為勝算獨操。極有把握。</p>
<p>不料穏瓶打碎。觀察全非。蘆溝橋事起。馮治安並不買賬。堅決抵抗。致田代前功盡葉無法交代。乃有自盡之說。此日人所不及料者一也。中央方面始而主張和平解决者。忽一變而為積極抗戰。此敵人所不及料者二也。而淞滬方面敵人認為數小時或一二日而解决者。今兩月餘而猶未解决。而損失之偉大。幾不可以數字計。此敵人所不及料者三也。敵人認為我國精神並不團結。實力並不充足者。今竟不分黨派。不分彼此。全國一致。戮力禦寇。此敵人所更不及料者四也。敵人至此。朋知事已弄僵。無法收拾胸中懊喪。而下馬爲難。此實敵人之苦衷也。至於國際方面。亦極憤慨。制裁强暴之聲。雲湧風起。而敵人作戰力量。亦全部揭穿。黷武之報。行將立見。不知敵人其亦自覺否乎。</p>

<h3>今日的朱彭(續)</h3>
<p>— 中央社記者王少桐</p>
<p>抗戰的前途</p>
<p>我們又談到民族抗戰如何取到勝利的問題、朱彭兩先生的意見、完全一致的、他們認為西北兩綫的戰事我們是失利了、但是這僅是局部的、最後勝利必屬我們、但是要爭最後勝利、對過去的失敗原因、須加檢討和改善其戰衛、我國這次為自衛而抗戰所在戰略上是防禦、惟因我國兵器遠不如人國防的設備、又極微弱、如果採取單純的防禦、必然招致失敗、所以我們在戰術上、必須採取積極的防禦、即攻擊的防禦、這種攻擊的防禦就是要能乘敵人於運動中、或在敵人立足未穏之時集中我們優勢的兵力、向其猛攻、庶可殲滅敵人、否則只知在一地死守、無異幫助敵人發揮其現代技術威力、結果、與其老是那樣的死守、毋寗說是守死、過去的失敗、就是敵人能以其所長、攻我所短、我們要敢勝敵人、相反的要避其所長攻其所短、要能深入敵人的後方、隨時予以襲擊、一開始就是白刃相接、與他肉搏、這樣是避開敵人技術優勢的最好辦法、要能深入敵人的後方、最好是能運用游擊戰術、遊擊部隊可在敵人的後方、建立許多小根據地、來分別削弱敵方兵力、同時將我們的主力可應用於突擊方面、而不以多數兵力使用於防禦與箝制方面、使自己受箝制、如此敵人將疲於奔命窮終應付、這樣無形的我們已易被動於主動的地位、勝利屬於我們、是很有把握、但是如向發揮遊擊戰、就是要首先發動民衆遊擊、而與羣衆是分離不開的、遊擊戰也就是羣衆抗戰的最高形勢、在發動羣衆的時期我們應該趕快組織羣衆、訓練羣衆、我國人民現尚缺少素養、或者因受以前紀律不良的軍隊的擾害、這實在是最痛心的事、現在正是對暴敵抗戰的時候、如果軍隊遇有侵擾百姓的情事、眞是可痛心的事、要知道無論何種戰事、如果得不到人民的帮助、這是决難取勝利的、朱彭兩氏對上列的意見、以極誠懇的言詞達出、我們正在爭取戰事最後勝利的時候、對兩氏的意見、實在値得注意的、</p>
<p>八路軍實質的考察</p>
<p>記者於訪問朱彭兩氏之餘、同時對八路軍的實質、曾大概的考察一下、誰都知道八路軍就是以前中國“紅軍”的前軍、他們在過去十年中、是經過了五次大圍剿、遭了無窮的困難、而他們都能將各種困難一一克復、他們的部隊今天依然存在着、我想這不該是偶然的事罷、當記者未向八路軍部考察之前、多少也像一般人那樣、對他們是含有神密奧妙的心理、就是他們所以能存在的原因在那裏、經過這次考察覺得他們存在的原因、很平常、很簡單、很必然、正像一幕戲而被拆穿後的一樣、不足希奇、可是問題就在要戲法者的一點訣巧、這個訣巧、可以分精神與物質兩方面來談、在精神方面他們除訓練外、對政治問題、社會現狀和羣衆心理、每天都有一小時的講話、使每一個份子對每一個問題、至少都有一個淺近瞭解、這可說是他們領袖的聰明、因為心理上的瞭解可產生意志相同的結果、意志相同、精神就會團結、步調就能一致、力量也能產生、這差不多說是一種定律了、譬如說他們的部隊、此次參加抗日他們每一個士兵平時早已都明瞭日本帝國主義的罪惡、和侵略中國種種的野心、他們每一個兵士的腦中、早已存對日本非打倒不可的觀念、無疑的他們在抗日戰綫上步調一定一致、精神一定團結、而且一定能產生偉大的力量、記者在八路軍部時、隨便問到他們一個十四五歲的勤務兵、他能告訴你為什麼要打倒日本、和他們這次來前綫的任務、這實在値得驚佩而注意的、其次他們是不分階級、總司令也罷勤務兵也罷、除了職務的區別外、平時是在一塊娛樂、一塊談天、一個士兵去見總司令、是很平常、沒有看見太拘束的窘狀、也沒有看見長官無謂的威武、一個士兵、作錯了事、沒有以打罵來責罰、只以和善的指示、糾正他們錯誤、你想這樣一個集團、精神沒有拘束、只有融洽和愉快、如何不產生偉大的力量如何會輕易的被摧毀、他們每天祇是在那裏生長啊、再說到物質方面、完全是平等待遇、總司令今天吃肉、士兵定也吃肉、士兵今天吃靑菜、總司令一定也吃靑菜、總司令服裝和士兵沒有分別、簡直沒有例外、這雖然是些小事、實際上物質享受的平等、正有轉移精神莫大的作用、因為物質待遇的平等、可以使每個士兵精神上得到安慰、這個安慰、却產生沒怨艾沒不平的結果、再有一點、就是八路軍的幹部、他們都能瞭解羣衆、而抓着羣衆、他們無論何時何地、總是以羣衆擺在前面、他們把大部份的工作、是做在羣衆身上、所以他們所到處、都能得到羣衆的同情和幫助、記者此次經八路軍的附近村莊、無論問到那個居民對八路軍都是有特別的好感、都給了許多好的批評、我想每個居民、不見得都說謊罷　這些雖都是八路軍的特點、實際說來、都是很平常的事、算不了什麼訣巧、我想那一個帶隊的官長、都能明瞭、而訣巧還是在能否切實做到、八路軍能做到所以給人們一個特殊印象、記者在前綫的時間太短促、所見到八路軍的情形、是這樣一個膚淺的概念、深信說的不能十分透澈和詳盡、這僅可說是盡了記者忠實報道的一點責任而已、</p>

<h3>Our Army in Northern Shanxi Recovers Guangling and Xinkou, Enemy Northwest Surrounded</h3>
<p>Enemy and our forces engage in a major battle in the Dabaishui area. Our army on the Jinpu Line crosses the plains, rumored to have captured Dezhou. Our forces are eliminating remnants of the enemy at Zhangzhuang.</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Our army's Yang Detachment, after intercepting over a hundred enemy transport vehicles and routing the enemy's covering troops between Lingqiu and Guangling on the 15th, pursued the victory to a location more than ten miles from Guangtai. There, they encountered over two hundred enemy cavalry and thirty vehicles, fully loaded with infantry reinforcements, and once again routed them all. Our forces, in triumphant pursuit, then recovered the city of Guangling and are currently continuing the chase. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] North of our Xinkou, fierce attacks against the enemy resumed at dawn on the 17th. The enemy resisted stubbornly, and fierce fighting continued until the time of this dispatch. (Central News Agency dispatch at 8 PM on the 17th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] There have been fierce battles in the northwest of Xinkou for days. After our forces annihilated the enemy at Nanhuaikou (west of Xinkou), more than three thousand reinforcements arrived on the 16th and broke into our positions. We also reinforced with fresh troops and surrounded the enemy again. Fierce fighting continued all day, killing two thousand five or six hundred enemy soldiers. Only about two hundred enemy remnants remain, which can be completely annihilated soon. On the left flank, our forces engaged the enemy in a major battle in the Dabaishui (west of Nanhuaikou) area, with artillery fire not ceasing all day. The situation remains in stalemate. North of Xinkou, after our forces launched an offensive, they encountered over a thousand enemy soldiers near Yaoyuan Village, south of Guoxitou, and engaged in fierce fighting. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] News from the front indicates that our advance troops have indeed crossed Pingyuan. However, the rumor that a certain division of ours has recaptured Dezhou remains to be confirmed. When the enemy retreated, they breached the Tuhai River to block our army. We are currently eliminating a portion of the enemy remnants at Zhangzhuang. (Urgent dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] A phone call from Yucheng at dawn on the 17th reported that our advance troops are continuously advancing forward and crossed Pingyuan in the afternoon, continuing the pursuit in victory. Also, a portion of the enemy remnants near Zhangzhuang have been surrounded by us and are being cleared. When the enemy collapsed and retreated, they breached the Tuhai River to obstruct our army's advance. (Central News Agency dispatch at 10 PM on the 17th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] Military news: 1. Our guerrilla forces ambushed the enemy army more than ten miles south of Lianzhen on the 16th, resulting in a fierce battle. They killed over two hundred enemy soldiers, captured over eighty rifles of various sizes, three machine guns, and over ten horses. We had three killed and several wounded. 2. Our powerful forces have now reached the area west of Jimingdian, and a portion has advanced to the vicinity of the railway line to cooperate with our front-line troops in a pincer attack. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] A certain high-ranking officer stated that our right flank has advanced to Nanpi and Dongguang, thirty miles from the enemy. If the enemy attempts to invade south again, we can cut off their retreat. Once the enemy engages in hand-to-hand combat, they invariably collapse. Only half of them are Japanese; the rest are Koreans and Manchurians. Jinan is definitely not in danger. Today, a certain division commander of ours led his troops to cross the Tuhai River via a pontoon bridge from Yucheng, and most have reached the Zhangzhuang area. The forward troops have already crossed Zhangzhuang. According to reconnaissance, there are no enemy traces in Pingyuan, because their rear lines between Cangzhou and Botou were cut off by us, and they fled north in panic. The hearts of the people here are greatly stabilized. This morning, eight enemy planes in two waves flew along the Jinpu Line between Rizhao and Zixian, Taian, but have not yet dropped bombs. (Urgent dispatch at 11 AM on the 17th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Relevant sources received a telegram from Jinan on the 16th, stating that our defending troops in Pingyuan fought a bloody battle with the enemy for two days, engaging in hand-to-hand combat several times. In this battle, Zhang Lusheng's battalion killed approximately three hundred enemy soldiers. The third company of Wang Shoucheng's battalion killed even more. Our soldiers suffered approximately thirty casualties. Subsequently, due to continuous enemy reinforcements and our numerical inferiority, after a fierce battle, we retreated south to the Tuhai River and are currently in a stalemate. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Relevant sources have just received a telegram from Jinan: 1. The enemy and our forces remain in stalemate across the Tuhai River. There is no change in the enemy situation on our side. On the left flank of a certain regiment of ours, over two hundred enemy infantry were discovered and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. 2. Our security forces have been actively operating near Nanpi for days. They have learned that enemy armored vehicles and three to four hundred soldiers are stationed at Cangzhou, Botou, Dongguang, and other stations. There are dozens of small motorboats in the canal. This force attacked Nanpi at dawn on the 11th, immediately resulting in a fierce battle. The enemy could not withstand it and retreated north. They are now planning to operate in the Dongguang area. 3. On the morning of the 16th, enemy planes were reconnoitering over Yexian, Changyi, Weixian, Yidu, and Yucheng, but did not drop bombs. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] Our guerrilla forces ambushed Japanese puppet troops more than ten miles south of Lianzhen on the 16th, killing over two hundred enemy soldiers and capturing over eighty rifles, three light machine guns, and over ten horses. Also, during a night raid on Dongguang on the 15th, the enemy burned their own ammunition and baggage. The fire was still burning at noon on the 16th. A certain unit of ours arrived at Shierli Temple, twelve miles north of the Tuhai River, today and engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. A certain unit on our right flank has now advanced to the west of Jimingdian, closing in on the railway line to launch a pincer attack with our front-line troops. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] Military news: 1. In the Jinpu area, enemy remnants are still entrenched on the north bank of the Tuhai River. 2. Our army is now on the south bank of the Tuhai River, sending detachments to threaten the enemy from the flanks and maintaining a tight guard. At 4 PM on the 16th, a certain unit on our left flank discovered over two hundred enemy infantry and engaged them in a fierce battle for two hours, driving them back. 3. A certain unit of our guerrilla forces had advanced to the county seat of Nanpi on the 14th and saw seven or eighty enemy soldiers there. They immediately attacked, killing two or thirty enemy soldiers. The enemy then fled north in a panic. Our guerrilla forces then proceeded to Botou and Dongguang to destroy the railway and mop up the enemy remnants. Also, news from the front indicates that the night was calm, and intermittent gunfire was heard on both flanks on the morning of the 16th. Our army is still firmly holding the line between Zhangzhuang and Yucheng. At 10 AM on the morning of the 16th, two enemy planes dropped five bombs at Yucheng Station, attempting to bomb the gate tower but missed. They fled after being shot at by our army. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>A Certain Route Army's Circular Telegram Announces Victory</h3>
<p>Reports Details of Killing Enemies and Seizing Territory</p>
<p>⊙ Guangshi, Shen Bao, Victory Report, A. Our Left Wing Army: Since recovering Jingping and Pinglu, a portion of this army attacked and occupied Ningwu City on the night of the sixth. Due to the enemy's strong defense in the city, it was not captured. On the night of the seventh, another portion of this army attacked Daiyue Town, Yulin Village, and Mayi, south of Datong. Except for Daiyue, the other two places were recovered, destroying bridges and electrical lines. On the tenth, this unit attacked the northern and southern enemy villages in the Renjian area of Daiyue Town, seizing dozens of rifles and destroying six vehicles. The enemy left behind over a hundred corpses. On the night of the twelfth, a portion of this army ambushed twelve enemy vehicles at Shilipu, north of Guoxian. The enemy suffered fifty or sixty deaths and many injuries. All vehicles were burned. On the same day, a portion of this army attacked Xinzhuang, south of Daiyue, and routed the enemy, fully loaded in sixty-eight vehicles, killing over two hundred enemy soldiers. The corpses were not collected, and eighteen vehicles were destroyed. In the morning of the thirteenth, a total of fifty-seven enemy tanks, armored vehicles, and vehicles, fully loaded with infantry and artillery, reinforced Ningwu from Shuoxian. Our cavalry detachment had already destroyed the roads and ambushed them at Majiawan, ten miles north of Ningwu City, completely routing the enemy, who fled back to Shuoxian. The enemy in Ningwu City was greatly panicked and broke through and fled on the night of the twelfth. The city was indeed recovered by our army and a certain unit of allied forces. On the night of the fourteenth, a certain brigade on our right flank occupied Guoxian and nearby [unclear characters] and Yongxing Village, seizing one armored vehicle, seven war horses, and a portion of military supplies. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the remaining enemy. B. Our Right Wing Army: Since annihilating the enemy at Pingxingguan on the twenty-fifth of last month, a portion of this army attacked and occupied Laiyuan City on the tenth. The enemy defending the city fled towards Yixian, and they also seized many military supplies. The Italian Catholic priest, the head of the maintaining association, and other traitors in the city were ordered to be handed over, and our central government was requested to lodge a protest with the Italian government, ordering the country's priests not to engage in similar behavior again. This unit again attacked the two cities of Lingqiu and Guangling with its main force on the thirteenth and cut off the highway. The results are awaiting announcement. On the thirteenth, another portion of our right-wing army recovered Pingxingguan. The main force of this unit is attacking Tuanchengkou from Pingxingguan. The highway at the pass has been destroyed for more than ten miles. No vehicles have come and gone since the first of the month. On the fourteenth, another portion of our right-wing army intercepted over one hundred and thirty enemy vehicles on the Pingxingguan-Lingqiu line and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. The results will be announced later. Another unit is attacking from the Pingxingguan-Fanshi-Daixian line, and another unit is attacking from the east on the Guoxian-Xinxian line, echoing our Left Wing Army, intercepting and attacking the enemy's rear to support the friendly forces fighting on the Xinkou front. Our right-wing cavalry detachment is still operating east of Hangtang and Quyang,夾(unsure) in the Pinghan Road to weaken the enemy's strength. Since (unclear code) Shuoxian, the enemy's vast rear has been in turmoil under our fierce attacks and seems to be difficult to cope with. Although our army has suffered casualties, its morale is high, and the people have also risen up to resist the enemy. The enemy and our situation are changing. Recently, the enemy has committed all kinds of atrocities, including raping, looting, and plundering in Pinglu, Shuoxian, Ningwu, Laiyuan, Lingqiu, and Daiyue. Entire villages have been burned down, and civilians have been killed, with some incidents involving thousands of people, some hundreds of people, and dozens or even a few people being killed occurring frequently. We hope that the national people and the people of the world will rise up and denounce this unprecedentedly brutal enemy.</p>
<h3>Commander Hao Menglin and Others Sacrificed Their Lives for the Country in the Battle of Dabaishui</h3>
<p>The Remains Were Transported and Coffined Yesterday</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Since the beginning of the war in northern Shanxi, none of the battles were fiercer or the sacrifices greater than the battle of Dabaishui on the 15th and 16th. The advance and retreat of the Dabaishui, Gezhuang, and Zhangjiazhuang line was enough to affect the entire future of the war situation in northern Shanxi, so both sides fought to the death with their main forces. After two days of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered approximately four thousand or more casualties. Our army also suffered extremely heavy losses. What is even more regrettable is that Commander Hao Menglin, Division Commander Liu Jiaqi, and Brigade Commander Zheng Tingzhen all died one after another because they took the lead, bravely commanded, and fought heroically. Since the Republic of China, Commander Hao is the first army commander to die on the battlefield while supervising the battle. From this, we can imagine the fierceness of the battle and the tragic nature of the sacrifices, which were enough to shock the heavens and make the ghosts cry. After Commander Hao and others died, the morale of the army was even more boosted, and the enemy was very discouraged upon hearing this. The results of this battle will definitely add a glorious page to the future Sino-Japanese war history. Currently, the remains of Commander Hao and others have been transported to Bingtang, and the coffining ceremony was held at the Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery outside the East Gate on the morning of the 17th. Commander Yan Xishan was extremely saddened by the brave sacrifice of Commander Hao and Division Commander Liu. At 1 PM that day, he sent the deputy commander of the 34th Army, Chuan Cunhuai, as his representative to pay tribute. Military and political officers and representatives of the people also went to pay tribute. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>[Guangzhou] According to unconfirmed Chinese sources, a Japanese aircraft carrier ran aground on Hebao Island, west of Macau. Multiple Japanese destroyers are currently struggling to help it out of danger, but have not yet succeeded. Guangzhou has not been subjected to air raids in the past two days.

<h3>Enemy Planes Drop Yellow Poison Powder in Ningbo</h3>
<p>Microorganisms Discovered in Rivers</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Wang Haonan, the commander of the Ningbo Defense Command, reported to the Military Affairs Commission that enemy planes dropped yellow poison powder over Ningbo, and many microorganisms were subsequently discovered in the rivers. He requested the Ministry of Interior to notify the provincial and municipal governments to pay special attention to drinking water. The rivers near enemy territory must be properly guarded by police or militias. The Kyoto Municipal Government has issued a notice on the 16th. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Our Foreign Ministry Replies to the Belgian Government, Hoping for the Success of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>To Restore Peace in the Far East Based on Justice. The United States Also Formally Declares Participation in the Conference and Sends Capable Representatives to Take Active Action</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is scheduled to open in Brussels on the 30th of this month. The Belgian chargé d'affaires to China has already sent an invitation to our country. Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui replied by telegram yesterday, stating in brief: "The Chinese government accepts the invitation of the Belgian government and hopes for the success of the conference, so that peace in the Far East can be quickly re-established based on international conventions and justice." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The United States has now formally accepted the invitation of the Belgian government to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to be convened in Brussels on October 30. The members of the US delegation have also been appointed and are scheduled to sail from New York on the "Washington" transport ship on the 20th of this month. It is reported that the initial purpose of the United States in participating in the conference is to promote "agreed-upon peace" between China and Japan. Well-informed sources observe from the following two circumstances that the United States will take a firm stand at the conference: 1. The United States quickly accepted the Belgian government's invitation, regardless of whether the participants in the conference are limited to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty or whether Germany and the Soviet Union are invited. 2. The members of the US delegation are extremely strong and well-organized. It is said that the US government does not place much emphasis on which countries participate in the conference. The United States is prepared to cooperate with any country that is willing to join the mediation efforts in the Sino-Japanese conflict. Secretary of State Hull said that, as far as he knows, the first meeting of the conference will probably be limited to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. The following is the US reply accepting the invitation: "The US Secretary of State hereby presents his compliments to the Belgian Ambassador and solemnly accepts the Ambassador's letter of October 16 of this year, stating that the Belgian government, at the request of the British government and with the consent of the US government, specifically proposes that the signatory countries of the treaty signed on February 6, 1922, hold a conference in Brussels on the 30th of the tenth month to examine the situation in the Far East in accordance with Article 7 of the treaty and to study methods for a speedy and peaceful resolution of the regrettable conflict there. The US government hereby gladly accepts its invitation and has been chosen by the President. Mr. Davis has been chosen as the representative of the United States." (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull announced today that the United States has accepted Belgium's invitation and is preparing to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Brussels on the thirtieth. Belgium's letter of invitation did not state whether the conference would be attended only by the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, or whether the signatories of the Kellogg-Briand Pact would be invited to participate together. Hull also said that he does not yet know the agenda of the conference, and the US delegation may not ask President Roosevelt for instructions before departing. Government sources said that this US attendance at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will be the most active action taken towards the foreign situation since participating in the Treaty of Versailles. The departure of the US delegation is so rapid, showing that President Roosevelt wants to make at least a considerable decision at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference before the opening of the special session of Congress. At the same time, the President also wants to be able to decide on the action to be taken before the Japanese army makes further progress in North China. The diplomatic circles believe that the first step should be to request a temporary ceasefire between China and Japan. Ambassador Davis is best suited for this kind of negotiation. (National Telegraph on the 16th)</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt spoke to reporters at Hyde Park City yesterday, explaining the mission of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The President at the time advised reporters not to speculate on the future development of US policy. The intention was to once again explain that US policy is purely based on the changing situation. President Roosevelt also said that if the atmosphere is good, the US government may be prepared to mediate between China and Japan. Therefore, people generally believe that the instructions given to Davis, the chief representative of the US at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, are to first seek a basis for the Commission's approach. Well-informed people are not overly optimistic about the success of the conference. As for what kind of situation will arise if this conference cannot find a compromising approach, the State Department has also considered it. The reason is that the US government still wants countries to take joint action to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, and has not yet drafted a detailed plan. US officials also said that although the current tense situation in the Mediterranean has no direct relationship with the United States, the policy of how the United States will cooperate with other countries in the Far East can only be determined after the Mediterranean issue is resolved. In short, if the results of the London Adjustment Conference can ease the tense situation in Europe, then the hope of resolving disputes in the Far East will naturally be strengthened. (Havash Telegraph on the 16th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The US government would very much like several countries in South America to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and has unofficially put forward this suggestion, and it is possible that the goal may be achieved. (Havash Telegraph on the 16th) ⊙ Well-informed sources in Brussels, Belgium, recently declared that after the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the general situation in the Far East will be reviewed first, and it will be decided which non-signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty should be invited to participate in the conference. Invitations will be sent immediately, and then the adjournment will be announced until the first ten days of November before the meeting is held again, so that the non-signatory countries invited to participate can appoint and send representatives to attend during the adjournment period. (Havash Telegraph on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Japan Is in a Dilemma Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>Divergent Opinions Within the Cabinet Regarding Whether to Attend. Russia and Germany Will Also Be Invited to Participate in the Conference</p>
<p>[Paris] People around Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, recently declared that it is not certain whether Japan will attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. In addition, the countries participating in the conference will probably send invitations to the Soviet Union and Germany before the opening of the conference on the 30th of this month. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union will agree to participate. As for Germany's attitude, it will depend on Japan's attitude. It is heard that Germany is currently trying to persuade Japan to participate because it has significant interests in China, so that Germany can also attend. Regarding this, the general public in France believes that Germany has not openly supported Japan, as Italy has done, so the Nine-Power Treaty Conference may become a peace conference. At present, the diplomatic circles of major European countries believe that the Japanese cabinet's attitude towards participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is inconsistent. Cabinet members who are close to the General Staff oppose any discussion that would ease military action before defeating the Chinese army, and therefore do not want to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Other cabinet members are afraid that if the war is prolonged, it will have adverse economic effects, so they advocate participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, hoping to obtain favorable armistice conditions. The two factions are at odds and have not yet reached an agreement. Well-informed sources in Britain and France believe that although China's diplomatic actions are based on the minimum conditions put forward by Chairman Jiang, other countries may come forward to mediate, so it is not impossible to find a compromise between China and Japan. As for Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, China will inevitably take the opportunity to weaken Japan's diplomatic position. Although China now knows that the members of the League of Nations oppose sanctions against Japan, if the war continues, China still hopes that the measure to prohibit the transportation of kerosene to Japan can be implemented. Therefore, China's diplomatic action will take this measure as its primary goal. So far, the pressure from the League of Nations has not been completely ineffective. For example, the League of Nations General Assembly condemned Japan's bombing of undefended cities in China, which has had some impact on the Japanese military authorities, and the League of Nations General Assembly's decision to provide spiritual assistance to China has also strengthened the position of moderates in Japan. It is hoped that the power of these people will gradually increase, so that the mediation actions that countries can take can be effective. (Havash Telegraph on the 16th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Times recently commented on the prospects of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, stating in brief that this is not a declaration of war against Japan, nor is it to expand the Sino-Japanese dispute into an international dispute. The Japanese government has repeatedly stated that it has no territorial ambitions towards China. The role of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is to give Japan an opportunity to prove this sincerity. Although the government has repeatedly stated that the disputes between China and Japan do not allow third-party intervention, Japan is a signatory country of the Nine-Power Treaty. According to Article 7 of the treaty, the signatory countries originally had the provision to exchange opinions. Therefore, convening the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is by no means intervention. There is no reason why Japan should refuse to participate. In summary, if Japan does not want to clearly break with the countries concerned with the Pacific problem and the Far East problem, and admits that it is an aggressor, then for the sake of its own interests, participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to seek a solution is indeed the best strategy.

<h3>Slight Easing of the Spanish Impasse</h3>
<p>Withdrawal of Volunteer Soldiers: Diplomatic Route to Resolution</p>
<p>[London] Italy, during yesterday's session of the Non-Intervention Committee, declared its willingness to withdraw a portion of its volunteer soldiers from Spain. Many countries feel that a satisfactory outcome regarding the Spanish situation is emerging. While London does not yet harbor extravagant hopes, Reuters diplomatic correspondents believe a resolution is largely anticipated, as Italy's proportional withdrawal and France's proposed proportional withdrawal can likely be reconciled through negotiations. The crucial point now lies in France's belief that the number of Italian volunteer soldiers far exceeds that of other countries. Parisian official circles are unwilling to offer criticism, but express satisfaction with the moderate tone of Italian representative Grandi's remarks. Furthermore, although the opinions expressed by various national representatives at yesterday's meeting were familiar, a different spirit prevailed in the atmosphere. Paris therefore feels hopeful about the future. As for Berlin newspapers' support for German representative Ribbentrop's statement that Germany will resume free action if other countries do so, Berlin political circles do not consider the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers a simple matter, and believe that lengthy discussions are needed before a resolution can be reached. Rome also expresses satisfaction with the progress of events. While British Foreign Secretary Eden's earlier speech caused dissatisfaction in both Germany and Italy, the meeting has made considerable progress. Italy reiterated its two conditions for withdrawing volunteer soldiers: strict supervision and recognition of belligerent status. However, Italy has not yet indicated whether it will agree to withdraw volunteer soldiers before belligerent status is recognized. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 17th)</p>

Labor unions in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Ireland have all replied by telegram, expressing their determination to implement a policy of boycotting Japanese goods.

<h3>Pittman Discusses That If Japan Still Does Not Repent</h3>
<p>All Nations Should Sever Diplomatic Relations</p>
<p>[New York] The New York Times Washington correspondent reported that Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told guests at his Reno residence that he hopes Japan will heed the advice of its many friendly governments and abide by their decisions. If Japan is stubborn and self-righteous, disregards the decisions of other governments, and continues to wage war in China, then not only should all governments sever diplomatic relations, but all civilized nations in the world should do so.

<h3>Nankai Alumni Hold Meeting to Commemorate Alma Mater's Founding</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Nankai School Alumni Association of Tianjin and its Nanjing branch held a meeting on the 17th to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of the founding of their alma mater. 418 alumni attended. First, Association President Wang Endong delivered an opening speech, followed by Lu Shanchen, who reported on the school's recent situation and the great significance of this year's commemoration. He Lian, former Dean of the College of Economics, spoke, stating that Principal Zhang Boling is determined to contribute Nankai's spirit of hard work to the government. Therefore, the work of institutions such as the Chemical Engineering Research Institute and the Economic Research Institute has been carried out with this aim. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is extraordinarily concerned about Nankai, and has repeatedly and earnestly spoken in his instructions, expressing his deep belief that the nation will be revived and Nankai will also be revived. Principal Zhang's current focus is far beyond the revival of a mere cultural institution. Next, Fang Xianting, Director of the Economic Research Institute, reported on the destruction of the school, stating that when enemy planes ravaged and bombed the buildings, more than 80 responsible faculty, staff, and workers did not retreat. After the bombing, the next day, they sent personnel to inspect, disregarding the danger and placing life and death aside. Finally, Cha Genchao, Vice President of Xiangshan Benevolent Children's Home and an older alumnus, reported on his observations along the Pinghan and Jinpu lines, stating that the soldiers are determined to fight the enemy to the death and that the prospects for the war of resistance are extremely optimistic. The meeting then adjourned for a luncheon, ending at 8 p.m. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Pacific Situation: US Navy Consolidates Hawaiian Defenses</h3>
<p>Making it an Impregnable Fortress: To Be Submitted to the Next Regular Session of Congress for Discussion</p>
<p>[Washington] The Associated Press learned today that the U.S. Navy intends to enhance the defenses of the Hawaiian Islands to the extent that it would be "absolutely unassailable" by any first-rate naval power. The proposal will be submitted when the next regular session of Congress opens. Senior naval officers stated that the Navy and Army departments have jointly studied the defense plan, which, when completed, will make the Hawaiian Islands the most solid fortress in the world, on par with Singapore and Gibraltar. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, strategic issues in the Pacific have become a global focus. Therefore, the United States must urgently seek to consolidate the defenses of Hawaii.

<h3>Fierce Battles on Both Banks of the Wenzaobang: Enemy Attempts to Assault Chenjiaxiang Repeatedly Repulsed</h3>
<p>Intense Struggle for Duntusi: Stalemate Continues; Remaining Enemy in Black &amp; Yellow Residence, etc., Fails to Break Through</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) Our newspaper's reporter went to the frontline in □□ last night to inspect. At the time, gunfire raged, with machine gun fire and battle cries incessant. The battle situation was extraordinarily fierce, and the bloodbath had not yet ceased when the reporter returned to the office at 1:00 AM this morning. The reporter met a senior military commander who was personally directing operations at the frontline. A summary of the battle situation on all fronts is as follows: 1. The focus of the battles in recent days remains along the banks of the Wenzaobang. The fighting is particularly intense in the Black &amp; Yellow Residence area west of the highway. Because of the battle on the 12th, the enemy's main force was almost completely annihilated. The damage was great and the pain was deep. Although they have the ambition to retake Dachang, their morale is low and they are easily defeated. Even if the enemy sends reinforcements to attack, they will only be sending themselves to their death. 2. Duntusi is on the north bank of the Wenzaobang, and Chenjiaxiang is on the south bank. Both are southeast of Guangfu Township, about three kilometers apart. In recent days, the enemy has been launching all-out assaults. The two sides have advanced and retreated several times on these two positions, with countless casualties. Currently, Chenjiaxiang is still in our hands, but neither side has occupied Duntusi. The fierce battle here is still in progress. 3. The remaining enemy forces on the south bank of the Wenzaobang are in positions like interlocking teeth, with no section not surrounded by us and no possibility of contact. The bloody battles at Duntusi and Chenjiaxiang are the enemy's plan to find another way out. The enemy believes that they can succeed by luck, and then directly move towards Nanxiang, threatening our rear. But we have strong forces defending it, taking each step carefully, and any enemy that comes will definitely be completely annihilated. 4. Starting at dawn this morning, more than 20 enemy planes flew over Dachang and the northern section of our frontline positions, dropping no fewer than several hundred bombs. However, our soldiers do not feel the slightest threat, and there is absolutely no damage to the fortifications. Enemy heavy artillery also continuously shelled us from the north bank of the Wenzaobang, day and night without stopping. We also returned fire. For a time, gunfire raged, and the roar of our artillery was even more magnificent and fierce than that of the enemy's. The reporter, being on the battlefield, felt doubly inspired. 5. Tonight (i.e., last night), the remaining enemy forces on the south bank of the river attempted to break through several times, but were all repulsed. The fierce battles in the Duntusi and Chenjiaxiang areas hardly stopped for a moment. The reporter was there, and the sound of machine guns was like a mountain collapsing and the sea overturning, which shows how intense the battle situation was. 6. Anti-war sentiment is unusually strong among the enemy forces. According to prisoners captured after the enemy was defeated by us in the crossing of the Miaojilun on the previous day, the total number of Japanese casualties in the Shanghai battle accounts for about half of all soldiers. They were originally a reserve division, and it was unexpected that they came here to participate in the war, so they were very unwilling in their hearts. Most of the frontline troops have not had food for three or four days, which is the most painful. Food is sometimes delivered by airplanes, but it is ultimately not universal. The fact that the entire army is currently in a state of anti-war sentiment cannot be concealed. The reporter then personally inquired about this with our loyal and brave soldiers on the frontline. According to reports, our supplies are abundant, wages are paid in full, and the frontline troops all carry dry bread, which can provide food for two days. There is absolutely no such miserable situation as in the enemy army.</p>
<h3>Battles on the South Bank of the Wenzaobang Gradually Becoming More Intense Again</h3>
<p>Remaining Enemy Forces Attempt to Break Through; All Met with Head-On Repulse by Our Troops</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, enemy troops on the south bank of the Wenzaobang have been harassing in all directions in recent days, attempting to break through the encirclement, but have all been met with a head-on blow and have failed. However, the enemy troops' plans to spy on Dachang to the south and invade Nanxiang to the west are becoming increasingly obvious. Therefore, the battle on the south bank has gradually become more intense since the night before, and the enemy troops' planes and artillery are particularly fierce. However, our troops are closely guarded. If the enemy troops come to invade, they will inevitably repeat the disastrous defeat of the Dachang invasion on the 12th. The situation in each area is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Black &amp; Yellow Residence</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter with the army in Jiangwan reported at 10:30 AM on the 17th that the enemy in the Black &amp; Yellow Residence area began to move eastward from the night before, attacking our position northwest of Huangjiazai. Our troops were prepared, so they launched a head-on blow before they got close. After a night of fierce fighting, the enemy was finally repulsed at 2:00 AM yesterday. Then, at dawn, the enemy came again with reinforcements. At around 9:00 AM yesterday, they used smoke screens to cover their advance, attempting to invade the area around our military positions along the Hutaigong Road, Huangjiazhai, Chenjiazhai, and Yujiazhai. Our troops came out of the trenches to meet them in battle. The enemy temporarily retreated at noon yesterday. In the evening, they attacked again for the second time. At the time of the report, they were still in a stalemate. The enemy east of Hutaigong Road attacked westward at 2:00 AM yesterday in order to coordinate. Our troops defended the Chen Di area around Tanjiawanzhai, persevering in the resistance. The enemy charged several times. Our troops used machine guns to sweep densely, and the enemy was ultimately unable to stay in front of our position for even a moment. After a fierce battle until 5:00 AM yesterday, the enemy retreated due to heavy casualties without any results.</p>
<p>Yanjiawan</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter with the army in Jiangwan reported at 9:00 PM on the 17th that in the eastern section of the Wenzaobang, the enemy had been shelling our Shenjiawan position from the north bank since dawn, and the booming sound did not stop until night. On the north bank of Shenjiawan, there were hundreds of enemy soldiers active. At noon, about a hundred enemy soldiers suddenly attacked north of Yanjiawan. However, after our fierce attack, they immediately retreated. Then, enemy troops were seen constructing fortifications nearby in both locations, seemingly to prevent our attacks. About a hundred enemy soldiers near Sanfengzhai began to harass us at around 3:00 PM, staying in front of our military position and shooting from time to time. The sound of gunfire was intermittent, and they were still in a stalemate at night. The enemy south of Jiangjiazhai was small in number and had been dormant for several days. In order to clear the remnants, we suddenly launched a night attack from Zhouchengzhai Zhangyuzhai at 9:00 PM this evening. Our air force also rushed to help, and morale was high. At the time of the report, a fierce battle had begun, and it was expected that the enemy could be swept away completely before dawn.</p>
<p>Bafangzhai</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter with the army in Jiangwan reported at 9:00 PM on the 17th that in the western section of the Wenzaobang, the sound of artillery was loud from 3:00 AM, and the enemy constantly shelled us from the north bank. At dawn, many enemy planes also came to help in the battle and dropped many bombs. At that time, about four to five hundred enemy soldiers in Bafangzhai on the south bank repeatedly attacked southward under the cover of artillery fire. Our troops defended their original positions and resisted calmly. The enemy did not retreat until 2:00 PM. Our troops did not pursue because the enemy planes were very active.</p>
<p>Gujiazhai</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Gujiazhai, about four kilometers east of the Hutaigong Road on the south bank of the Wenzaobang, was bombarded by fierce artillery fire from the enemy army from the night before to yesterday morning. However, our troops waited calmly and were not moved. They also aimed machine guns at the enemy army and maintained close vigilance. Although the enemy repeatedly attempted to spy on us, they did not dare to attack because our bullets were like a torrential rain. The enemy in Huzhai on the north bank divided into many small boats before dawn yesterday, attempting to secretly cross over to Gujiazhai to reinforce them. They were discovered by our troops and bombarded with mortars, destroying two of them. However, the enemy's artillery fire was extremely fierce, shooting and harassing the area around our Tangshenzhai and Suzhai all night without stopping.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Southeast of Guangfu: Enemy Forces Violently Assault Duntusi</h3>
<p>Bloody Battle All Night Last Night, Still Deadlocked; Yangjiazai, Tuqiao Area Also in Fierce Fighting</p>
<p>The enemy at Liuhang repeatedly attacked our army's frontline positions in front of Guangfu Township and were defeated. Therefore, they changed their attack from the northern and southern flanks. At Duntusi, about three kilometers southeast of Guangfu on the north bank of the Wenzaobang, and Chenjiaxiang, southwest of Duntusi, where Liuhang and Guangfu form a triangle, enemy forces launched a major offensive the night before, attempting to break through our army's lines, spy on Nanxiang, cross the river at Chenjiaxiang, and establish contact with enemy forces south of the bank. The enemy forces at Zhusanfang and Shenjiazai concentrated their forces on the day before and launched a fierce attack on our army's position at Duntusi at 7:00 PM, pouring all their strength into the attack. Enemy planes were very active in the dim moonlight. At the same time, enemy artillery in the rear also fired continuously, covering the advance of their tanks and infantry. The gunfire was intense and unusually fierce. Our troops fought bravely, struggling fiercely. The enemy forces advanced, and countless numbers sacrificed themselves to the bayonets and machine guns of our troops. The battle continued until midnight, and a point was broken through because the fortifications had been heavily damaged. Our army's fresh troops also arrived at that time, and the entire line of troops suddenly became more vigorous, working together to counterattack. Our troops charged forward fiercely, fighting the enemy in a bloody battle. By 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the point of breakthrough had been completely restored. Yesterday afternoon, enemy troops sent reinforcements to attack again, and the bloody battle in the Duntusi and Chenjiaxiang areas resumed. Our troops charged and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy was also stubborn. The enemy's casualties were heavy, and our troops also sacrificed gloriously, firmly defending without retreating. Fierce fighting continued all night, and the two armies were still locked in a fierce stalemate this morning.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter with the army in Guangfu reported at 3:50 PM on the 17th that a fierce battle broke out again at dawn today on the frontline in Guangfu Township, which had been quiet for less than a week. The enemy, with a force of more than 1,200 soldiers, launched a fierce attack on our right-wing division's position from the Yangjiazai, Zhangjiazai, and Tuqiao areas southeast of Guangfu. Our defending troops fought bravely under the enemy's fierce artillery fire and charged out of the trenches several times. After three or four hours of fierce fighting, the enemy's corpses were everywhere, and casualties were almost all but wiped out. Our troops also sacrificed gloriously. In the afternoon, the enemy's rear units continued to come to attack. At the time of the report, the battle was still in progress. The enemy at Lao Wuzhai and Meizhouzhai had been stepping up the construction of fortifications and erecting barbed wire fences. Our troops suddenly launched an attack at dawn to destroy their fortifications. The enemy near the Tangzhai and Zhangzhai southwest of Luodian was laying land mines, and enemy planes were constantly spying and dropping bombs on our positions. Our troops were scattered in the fields and were not damaged at all. Because the enemy's repeated attacks on the Shixianggong Temple and Guangfu line had made no progress, they had changed from offense to defense and concentrated their forces to attack Guangfu to the south and both banks of the Wenzaobang. Our troops had been closely guarded.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Launched Eight Fierce Attacks on Enemy Positions Last Night and This Morning</h3>
<p>Two Bombs Hit Enemy Barracks on Ningguo Road; Flames Shot into the Sky, Killing Many Enemy Soldiers</p>
<p>Our air force launched two attacks on enemy positions the night before, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. At 7:10 PM, 10:20 PM last night, and 0:35 AM, 0:55 AM, 2:00 AM, and 2:15 AM to 2:30 AM this morning, it again launched several fierce attacks on enemy ships in the Huangpu River and enemy bases in eastern Shanghai. The enemy troops responded in a panic. Searchlights illuminated the sky, like long, glittering rainbows. The sound of anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns was like the sound of drums beating in unison. The sound of machine guns and bombing explosions from our air force also occurred at the same time. With a thunderous roar, the enemy positions suffered extremely heavy damage. According to confirmation from responsible parties afterward, when our air force first attacked at around 7:00 PM, two massive bombs dropped by our air force hit Lane 458 on Ningguo Road in Yangshupu, eastern Shanghai (this place was originally a residential area with more than 40 houses, which are now occupied by enemy troops and used as army barracks). A portion of the enemy's military supplies stored there was immediately hit by the bomb, exploding and burning violently. In addition to more than ten houses being instantly reduced to ashes, a very large number of enemy troops were unable to escape and were immediately killed by the explosion. At the same time, the fire became unstoppable. The raging flames soared, and the fire was clear when viewed from the Zhongshan Road area in western Shanghai. The embers had not completely extinguished until around 1:00 AM this morning. The extent of the losses in other places can be imagined. During the sixth attack by our air force, the sound of machine guns sweeping downward from the air continued for ten minutes. Finally, two more bombs were dropped, and the sound of the explosion was extremely loud.</p>
<p>During the last attack at 2:40 AM this morning, the enemy troops were completely unaware. After our air force quietly flew over the enemy's position and continuously dropped four bombs, the enemy troops began to frantically fight back. Our planes dropped two more bombs before safely returning. In total, our air force launched eight consecutive attacks on the enemy, dropping a total of more than 30 bombs. The extent of the enemy's losses can be seen.</p>

<h3>Enemy Harassment in Zhabei Repulsed</h3>
<p>Serious Ambitions for the Shuidian Road; Over 150 Enemies Killed or Wounded Yesterday</p>
<p>Enemy Marines Timid and Unwilling to Advance</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter with the army in Zhabei reported at 1:00 PM on the 17th that after our forces cleared the enemy forces in the alleys west of North Sichuan Road, the enemy was still trying to recover. However, their marines are abnormally timid in battle and unwilling to advance, so no fierce fighting has occurred. Last night, the enemy again took turns shooting with small artillery and machine guns, firing two or thirty shells before switching to machine gun sweeps. However, the enemy troops did not emerge. Our troops lay still in the trenches, occasionally returning fire. The sound of guns and artillery was quite fierce all night, but there was no fighting. Also, the enemy on the Shuidian Road seems to have serious ambitions. Therefore, at 2:30 this morning, they used small units to scout on various roads. Our sentries noticed and made contact. At around 7:00 AM, the enemy retreated after failing to achieve their objectives.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter with the army in Zhabei reported at 1:00 AM on the 18th that the area south of the Yokohama River and north of Bazilu on North Sichuan Road is under our control. Enemy traces have disappeared for two days, so it has been unusually quiet. At around 10:00 PM last night, two enemy companies again moved south to harass us. Their tanks moved slowly, probably fearing our ambush. When the enemy approached the intersection of Qiujiang Road and Guangdong Street, our troops rushed out, displaying their might on North Sichuan Road and engaging the enemy in street fighting for an hour. The enemy finally succumbed and retreated.</p>
<p>Enemy Defeated and Suffered Casualties While Harassing Baziqiao</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter with the army in Zhabei reported at 1:00 PM on the 17th that at around 5:00 AM this morning, the enemy concentrated two companies of troops in front of the Japanese Cemetery and launched a dawn attack, harassing our position at Baziqiao. The enemy fired fiercely with tanks and small artillery, while our troops bombarded densely with mortars and swept with heavy machine guns. After about an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy could not withstand it and retreated. The enemy suffered more than 20 casualties.</p>
<p>Our Troops Cleverly Ambush and Kill the Enemy</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter with the army in Zhabei reported at 1:00 PM on the 17th that the enemy who attacked our Tiyuhui Road last night was repulsed by our brave fighting until 2:00 AM this morning. At 4:30 AM, the enemy again attacked with three companies. Our troops moved quickly. Before the enemy got close, we jumped out from the shadows, fighting bravely. The enemy panicked, and there were many casualties. The battle continued until 7:30 AM at daybreak, when enemy planes came out. Our troops immediately withdrew to their original positions, and the enemy also retreated southeast to Fudan University. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than 130 casualties.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter with the army in Jiangwan reported at 1:00 AM on the 18th that the enemy at Sijing Stadium attacked our Ye Jia Garden guard line at 4:30 PM yesterday. After a brief encounter, the enemy was unable to continue advancing due to being blocked, so they soon retreated. At around 7:00 PM last night, our troops counterattacked, advancing steadily from Tiyuhui Road to the southeast of Fudan University, with tanks leading the way and infantry following. By midnight, they had crossed Guoquan Road and reached the vicinity of Hanjiage and Zhaojia Lane. However, they had not yet encountered any obstacles and were advancing silently.</p>
<h3>Two Enemy Planes Shot Down in Zhabei</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter with the army in Zhabei reported at 1:00 AM on the 18th that enemy planes continued to wreak havoc. This morning, they dropped many bombs at places such as the Maigen Road North Station. At around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, three more planes came in formation to carry out their murderous work. Our air defense troops did not fire easily, but were extremely angry at the enemy planes' constant harassment. Therefore, they cried out and fired accurately, bombing them. Where white smoke flew, two enemy planes were hit by us. One plane, wounded, sped away, trying to return to its original position, but collapsed and fell into the Huangpu River, sinking due to the severity of its injuries. The other plane was forced to land between Pengpu and Zhenru. Our troops are searching.</p>
<h3>Zhenru Township Bombed Completely by Enemy Planes</h3>
<p>Estimated That Over 200 Civilian Houses Were Destroyed; Civilian Deaths and Injuries Totaled Over 100</p>
<p>Yesterday, enemy planes bombed the entire town of Zhenru. At 9:30 AM, twelve enemy planes dropped twelve bombs in the Yangjiaqiao area of Zhenru, injuring more than twenty civilians and killing more than ten. At around 4:00 PM in the afternoon, fourteen more enemy planes came, dropping a total of more than twenty bombs in the entire town of Zhenru. More than fifty rooms in the Duanrenli housing area, etc., had been hit by bombs and caught fire. More than forty rooms in the Dongnan Zha, more than ten rooms in the Tangfang Street, more than ten rooms in the Liyuanbang, more than twenty rooms in the Dasiqian Street, more than twenty rooms in the Beishiqiao Street, more than forty rooms in the Caixin Street, more than twenty rooms in the Xigangzhen, more than thirty rooms in the Zhongshiqiao (of which more than twenty rooms have been burned down), more than ten rooms in the Zushentang, more than fifty rooms in the Xixiangzhen, and more than ten houses in the Wang family residence, more than ten rooms in the Caijia Street, and many other places were also destroyed. Over forty civilians were killed and fifty were injured. The 10th Rescue Team of the Chinese Red Cross and the Huxi Boy Scout Rescue Team arrived to provide assistance and transported the injured to various hospitals for treatment.</p>
<h3>Artillery Battle: Enemy Supplies Greatly Damaged</h3>
<p>Hengfeng Textile Mill Hit by Several of Our Shells; Bow of Yiyang Maru Also Hit by Our Shells</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River engaged in a fierce artillery battle with our artillery positions in Pudong the night before (the 17th). For a time, the booming sound shook the distance. Yesterday, according to a reporter who went to Pudong to investigate, the docks were full of shell holes. The Hengfeng Textile Mill, which was filled with enemy supplies, was hit by several of our shells and suffered great damage. The bow of the enemy merchant ship Yiyang Maru, which was anchored at buoy number 27, was also hit by one of our shells. The shell went horizontally through the ship. The enemy gunboat Anzhai, which was anchored near the ship, was also nearly hit. This shows the accuracy of our Pudong artillery's firing and the wonder of its technology.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Shell Chongming Island</h3>
<p>Several enemy ships sailed down from Baimaokou; one enemy ship ran aground at Laoshusha.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the Guangfu army reported from the front lines at 3:50 PM on the 17th that, according to military reports from the Liuhe front, an enemy warship near Maqiaokou suddenly shelled Chongming Island last night. The island is a sandbar, an isolated county at the river mouth with blocked transportation and no military installations. The enemy's intention in shelling it is difficult to fathom. The shells all landed in the river, and no civilians were harmed. According to military intelligence, Baimaokou was very quiet the previous night. After the failed landing, several enemy ships sailed downstream.</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Changshu on the 16th reported that an enemy ship that ran aground at Laoshusha outside Baimaokou remains stuck due to strong westerly winds and low tides. The situation is dire. Another ship is patrolling back and forth outside, seemingly providing protection. Our forces have not shelled the grounded ship because it is beyond the range of our artillery. All river ports along the Yangtze remain secure.</p>
<h3>Another Batch of Kwantung Army Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Dagon News reported that a reliable source said that an enemy transport ship arrived at the Huangpu Wharf in Yangshupu at around 10 PM the night before. In addition to unloading a batch of military supplies, approximately 5,000 troops from the Kwantung Army disembarked to be sent to the front lines. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai last night for Tianjin to transport more reinforcements to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Everywhere</h3>
<p>Pitiful Civilians in Non-Combat Zones Suffer Enormous Losses of Life and Property</p>
<p>Zhabei</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that starting at dawn yesterday, six enemy planes, divided into two groups, appeared over Zhabei, circling back and forth for reconnaissance. Around 8 AM, one group flew north along the Zhenda Road (from Zhenru to Dachang), dropping over 20 bombs. However, fearing attacks from our anti-aircraft guns, the enemy planes bombed from high altitude, making their targets inaccurate. Only a few of the twenty-odd bombs exploded, with the rest falling in nearby fields without detonating. The other group continued to circle over Zhabei. From 8:30 AM onwards, they dropped bombs one after another in the areas of Meigen Road and the North Station-Gonghe Road, dropping two or three bombs in some places and six or seven in others. The sound of explosions was constant. In total, they dropped over 40 bombs, but apart from destroying several civilian houses, there was no other damage. In Pudong, three enemy planes also circled and reconnoitered in the Yangjiadu area at 7:30 AM this morning, dropping over ten bombs and destroying several civilian houses. At 10:30 AM, the enemy planes returned to the Shanghai Pujiang blockade line at the 16th concession, flying low for reconnaissance for about half an hour before leaving.</p>
<p>Nanshi</p>
<p>At 9 AM yesterday, three enemy planes flew low over the Nanshi South Railway Station and Xiaocai Market area for reconnaissance, dropping absurd leaflets and strafing with machine guns. The public avoided them, so no one was injured. The enemy planes then ascended and flew rapidly to the Beixinjing area on Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai, dropping bombs.</p>
<p>Pudong</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, after 1 PM, six enemy planes indiscriminately bombed the Tangqiao district in Pudong, dropping incendiary bombs. Over a two-hour period, they dropped thirty to forty bombs, setting fire to 20 to 30 civilian houses and killing over ten civilians. The Zhangjiabang Electric Company and the Tangnan Elementary School were also bombed. At around 4 PM, refugees at the Dongjiadu wharf were crossing the river on ferries when an enemy plane dropped a large bomb, causing significant losses.</p>
<p>According to wounded civilians who came to Shanghai from Pudong for treatment, between 8 AM and 11:30 AM today (the 17th), enemy planes flew to Pudong several times, with two or three planes each time, dropping bombs and strafing with machine guns in areas such as Lujiazui and Yangjiadu. At around 2 PM, several enemy planes flew behind the Yitaixing Coal Depot in Pudong, dropping over ten bombs and injuring several civilians. Several houses in the area caught fire and burned fiercely. The fire was still burning at 5 PM.</p>
<p>Western Shanghai</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that at 11 AM yesterday, five enemy planes flew to the Luobiegen Road-Beixinjing area in western Shanghai, circling for reconnaissance. They then dropped over 20 bombs in Zhuzhai, destroying over 40 civilian houses, killing four residents, and injuring six. At 4:30 PM, three enemy planes reconnoitered back and forth on Zhongshan Road, dropping ten bombs near the Central Mint and the University of Greater China. Civilian houses in the area caught fire and burned fiercely, and the fire was not extinguished until late at night.

<p>A Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the Guangfu army reported from the front lines at 3:50 PM on the 17th that enemy planes have heavily bombed in and around Jiading City for the past three days, dropping no fewer than 100 bombs, resulting in the destruction of numerous civilian houses and the deaths of many civilians. The scene is tragic, and the area has become a desolate wasteland.</p>
<p>Su-Jia</p>
<p>At 9:15 AM yesterday, five enemy planes flew to the Suzhou Railway Station and dropped bombs, destroying two empty freight trains and several sections of the railway track, but no one was injured. At 9:45 AM, three enemy planes also bombed the Jiaxing Railway Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, dropping a total of six 250-pound bombs. Part of the station building was destroyed, but no one was injured.</p>
<p>Someone who came to Shanghai from Pingwang yesterday said that over ten enemy planes flew to Pingwang on the 16th and carried out heavy bombing, dropping dozens of bombs. The bombs all landed near the Pingwang Station on the Sujia Railway, without affecting the surrounding stations. However, many civilian houses in the area were destroyed, and about 100 civilians were killed or injured.</p>
<h3>Enemies Continue to Arrive with Military Supplies, Building Rafts</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that at around 7 AM today (the 17th), two more enemy transport ships, the No. 29 Dongji Maru (a converted merchant ship) and an unidentified transport ship, arrived in Shanghai and docked at the Huishan Wharf and the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf, respectively. They continued to unload large quantities of enemy military supplies, ammunition, coal, and other military necessities. In addition, the enemy has been building a large number of rafts at the end of Yangshupu Road for several days. As of yesterday, over 100 of these rafts have been completed. It is suspected that these rafts are intended for crossing the river and landing somewhere.</p>
<h3>The Story of Battalion Commander Liu's Martyrdom</h3>
<p>Charging into the enemy headquarters on North Sichuan Road, he single-handedly rushed upstairs and was shot and killed.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 14th, when our army fiercely attacked the enemy in Zhabei, Liu Hongshen, Battalion Commander of the 2nd Battalion of the ××× Regiment of the ××× Division, took the lead, charging forward with injuries, and died heroically. The tragic news brought tears to those who heard it and inspired great admiration. The circumstances of Liu's martyrdom and a brief biography are as follows: Since the start of the August 13th Resistance, Battalion Commander Liu has been commanding his troops in a certain location in Zhabei, repeatedly inflicting heavy blows on the stubborn enemy. At around 7 PM on the evening of the 14th, Battalion Commander Liu was ordered to attack the enemy headquarters on North Sichuan Road and take command. At that time, over a hundred enemy mortars, machine guns, and heavy artillery pieces were firing intensely, raining down like a storm. Liu led the way alone, fearless, and when he reached the enemy headquarters, he had already been shot. Still, he bandaged the wound and charged bravely, inspiring all the soldiers to be a hundred times more courageous. Despite the intense barrage of fire, they finally forced their way into the enemy headquarters, killing 200 enemy soldiers and capturing a large number of hand grenades, firearms, and other spoils of war. The enemy soldiers fled in panic upstairs. Battalion Commander Liu single-handedly rushed upstairs and was shot several more times, and was martyred. Liu's given name was Hongshen, a native of Liling, Hunan. He graduated from the 5th class of the Central Military Academy. He served as a platoon leader, company commander, adjutant, staff officer, regimental adjutant, etc. In the spring of 1935, he was promoted to battalion commander. He was only 31 years old when he was martyred. He is survived by his parents, wife, and children. The superiors will grant him preferential treatment.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Harassed Bingzhou Four Times Yesterday</h3>
<p>Suzhou, Jiaxing, Chang'an, and Songjiang were all bombed. We shot down one enemy plane in Pinding County.</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Enemy planes harassed Bingzhou four times on the 17th. Only the one at around 1 PM caused slight losses to our side. The invading enemy planes were four Type 96 bombers. They circled for about half an hour, dropping over ten bombs. Due to intense fire from our anti-aircraft guns, their targets were inaccurate. Only dozens of civilian houses were destroyed, and two workers were killed. Although another alarm was issued at around 3 PM, the enemy planes did not enter the city but reconnoitered and bombed the Xin County area. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] At 8:30 AM on the 17th, four enemy planes were spotted in Rizhao, passing over the northeast fortresses of Jingxian, Yishui, and Xintai, and dropping four or five bombs in Dawenkou. At 9 AM, four enemy planes were spotted in Feixian, passing over Tengxian Jiehe and Zouxian, and dropping several bombs in Liangxiadian. The extent of the damage is under investigation. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>[Suzhou] Recently, enemy planes have repeatedly come to Suzhou to bomb, hardly missing a day. From 8:15 AM to 5 PM on the 17th, this area was subjected to five air raids. Each time, the enemy planes wantonly bombed our innocent people, destroyed our transportation, and endangered travelers. Their actions were extremely cruel. The first attack involved dropping several bombs at the Waitang Station, destroying part of the station building and an empty car. In the third attack, the enemy used three heavy bombers, escorted by two fighter planes, to harass Suzhou for an hour. They dropped over ten heavy bombs on the station outside Pingmen and on a passenger train arriving at the station, destroying part of the station building and the platform, as well as civilian houses near the station. Some of the carriages were burned. Fortunately, the passengers disembarked and took shelter early, so there were few casualties. After the bombing, the enemy planes strafed with machine guns. Although our anti-aircraft machine guns and cannons fired intensely, the enemy planes flew very high, so they all escaped. The fourth and fifth attacks were both in the afternoon, focusing on reconnaissance along the railway line and dropping several bombs east of Waitang. The extent of the damage is still under investigation. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>[Jiaxing] Nine enemy planes flew to He (Jiaxing) at 10 AM on the 17th and dropped six heavy bombs over the station, all of which exploded, destroying one carriage. One bomb landed south of Yingzi Bridge, collapsing over twenty rooms of the Zhang family's house and damaging nearby civilian houses. Several people were injured. The railway tracks were undamaged. The planes left after thirty minutes. At 12 PM, two enemy planes flew to Shengze Station and dropped nine bombs, killing or injuring over forty people. At Chang'an Station, they dropped nine bombs, setting fire to two passenger cars and killing or injuring fifty-odd passengers. At Songjiang Station, they also dropped four bombs, but the tracks were undamaged. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>

Wang and the others returned fire with rifles, and the enemy plane was shot down. The two enemy pilots, a major and a lieutenant, were both killed by headshots. Several items were found, including charts and diaries with symbols for land-air communication. The plane has been moved to Potou Station and transported to Taiyuan. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] At 8 AM on the 17th, three enemy planes flew from Suzhou to Zhejiang, passing through Jiashan, Jiaxing, and Chang'an. As a passenger train from Shanghai arrived at Waiyangqi, it heard the alarm and stopped, and the passengers disembarked to take temporary shelter. The enemy planes dropped nine bombs and strafed with machine guns four times, killing eleven passengers, injuring about 100, destroying two passenger carriages, and six civilian houses. The seriously wounded were all sent to Hangzhou for medical treatment. Due to prolonged bleeding after arriving at the station, nine people died. The scene was unbearable. At 9:30 AM, four enemy planes reconnoitered Quangongting and Pinghu, and another six flew to He (Jiaxing), dropping six heavy bombs, destroying carriages, tracks, and water towers. They also flew to Shengze and dropped seven bombs, causing no losses. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<h3>Disturbances in Palestine Said to be Related to Italy</h3>
<p>Observations from the French Press</p>
<p>[Paris] According to some newspapers, the recent disturbances in Palestine are not unrelated to Italy. The Socialist Party's "People's News" stated that Italian radio stations have repeatedly broadcast news and speeches in Arabic to Palestine, attacking Britain. The Fascist Party often exploits the dissatisfaction of the Arab people with Britain to stir up trouble in order to cause great disputes for the British government. A reporter for the "Daily News" stationed in Rome said that Italy often makes Britain feel the possibility of a united rebellion in the Arab countries. In essence, this is tantamount to a threat. The right-wing "Figaro" retorted that Britain's recent strong attitude is out of character, which shows that the activities of Italian spies and their ambitions in the Near East are enough to make Britain uneasy. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 17th)</p>
<p>[Rome] It is claimed here that the tribal chiefs of Libya sent a telegram to Mussolini today, declaring their united support for the Arabs of Palestine. (National Telegraphic dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>⊙ Jerusalem: The British authorities here today arrested another 150 Arabs, all of whom were agitators and organizers of demonstrations in various places since the incident occurred. Arab figures are very satisfied with the Imam's escape from the Omar Mosque. However, it is reported that although the Imam escaped to Syria, he is being monitored by the French mandatory authorities. It is not yet known whether this is only because the Imam does not have a formal passport or because the British authorities have requested the French to extradite him. The British authorities have also taken extremely strict measures due to a fire at the Lydda airport, which completely destroyed the customs, passport inspection office, radio station, and other buildings. The entire city of Lydda has been placed under curfew, and no one is allowed to leave their homes for 24 hours. The army has surrounded the city, and the police are searching house to house and have arrested 48 suspects for interrogation. (National Telegraphic dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>Dongsha Island Observatory Staff Escape and Return Home</h3>
<p>Captured and taken to Taiwan for interrogation, released after two weeks; taken by enemy ship to Huilai County, Guangdong and allowed to land.</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: After Dongsha Island was attacked and occupied by the enemy, the "Dongsha Island Observatory" established by our Navy Department to facilitate navigation and the "Commercial Marine Products Company" on the island were also affected. At that time, the enemy interrogated the employees of the Marine Products Company before returning a motorized boat and several barrels of gasoline. The rest of the property was intended to be confiscated. The 27 staff members of the Observatory were all detained and sent to Taiwan because the enemy considered them to be naval personnel. It was not until the 23rd of last month that the personnel escaped and returned to Guangdong. Most of the Observatory staff were from Fuzhou and Xiamen. A family member of one of the staff members in Xiamen reported the following: On September 3, after the enemy Marines occupied Dongsha Island, they confined all the staff members in one room. Later, they were separated and interrogated individually, with severe torture and threats. After realizing that there were no military installations on the island, they stopped the abuse. On the 5th, they were taken aboard the enemy ship Asakaze and transported to Taiwan. They arrived in Kaohsiung that evening and were interrogated twice again by the military police, who imprisoned them for four days. They were then transferred to a fishing boat and moved to the Hua Yun Port Military Police Sub-Detachment, where they were subjected to cruel treatment, imprisoned in damp, dark cells, and deprived of food. On the 19th, the enemy military police chief announced their release and return to their country. That afternoon, they departed on the Nan Jin Maru, a fishing boat heading out to sea. After sailing for three days and three nights, on the 22nd, they transferred again to the enemy ship Asahi Maru. On the 23rd, they sailed to the waters outside Zishen Port in Huilai County, Guangdong, where they captured two of our fishing boats and drove the 27 people onto the fishing boats. The enemy ship then left. The fishing boats entered Zishen Port at 1 PM and landed at Yuangxiang. The village head led them to the Jinghai District Public Office, which reported the matter to the Huilai County Government. That night, a car was dispatched to the county seat, where 17 people are still temporarily residing in the Huilai County Government. They have reported the incident to the Navy Department and are awaiting orders. (October 5th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Our Country's Attitude Towards the Brussels Conference</h3>
<p>— Shen □□</p>
<p>Based on the League of Nations General Assembly resolution of the 6th of this month, the Nine-Power Treaty signatory conference has been decided to be held in Brussels, Belgium, on the 30th of this month. The United States, one of the main actors in the conference, has already officially appointed Roosevelt's confidant, Special Envoy to Europe, Davis, as its chief representative, and he will leave for Europe to attend the meeting immediately. It is also rumored that the British chief representative will be Foreign Secretary Eden. At the same time, politicians, the media, and popular organizations from all over the world have been focusing their attention on the upcoming conference these past few days, expressing their fervent hopes for it. From this, it is evident that while the Nine-Power Treaty signatory conference's task is limited to mediating the Sino-Japanese conflict, its significance is actually global.</p>
<p>We, the central object of the Nine-Power Treaty, should of course adopt a particularly cautious and vigilant attitude towards this major conference, which is directly related to the future of our war of resistance and the security of the Far East, so as not to delay the future of the great cause that millions of soldiers on the front line and hundreds of millions of people in the rear are vowing to fight for with all their might.</p>
<p>To determine our attitude towards the Nine-Power Treaty conference, we must first have a clear understanding of it.</p>
<p>We know that the League of Nations' suggestion to convene the Nine-Power Treaty conference and the United States' active support for it are among the various expressions of sympathy from countries around the world, especially Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, in the past month in opposing aggression and upholding justice and peace for our country. The most prominent of these expressions include President Roosevelt's speeches in Chicago and several subsequent ones, the US State Department's important statement denouncing Japan's destruction of treaties and implementation of aggression, the widespread anti-Japanese movement in Britain, Prime Minister Chamberlain's speeches advocating peace and stopping violence, and the League of Nations General Assembly's official condemnation of Japan's aggression against China and violation of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Thus, we are quite encouraged by this consistent cooperation between Geneva and Washington, and the initiative to hold the Nine-Power Treaty conference to resolve the current tense situation in the Far East, seeing in our friendly nations their good intentions of loving peace and spurning aggression, and their willingness to come forward to mediate despite their hard work and fear of difficulties; therefore, we have accepted the invitation without hesitation and are prepared to attend.</p>
<p>This time, the United States and the League of Nations (mainly the decisive cooperation of Britain) undoubtedly stem from both sides' urgent need to restore peace in the Far East and stop the aggressor's attempt to dominate, in order to protect the original interests of Britain and the United States in China. After the start of the Battle of Shanghai, the Japanese invaders intensified their rampant actions, constantly threatening and infringing upon the rights and interests of Britain, the United States, and other countries in China, while also being externally stimulated by the spirit of our entire nation uniting to resist foreign aggression and resolutely fight, and internally pressured by the勢 of the vigorous anti-Japanese movement among the people. As a result, the voices in Washington and Geneva rejecting aggression and upholding justice became loud and clear; the proposal to convene a conference of the Nine-Power Treaty signatories was immediately passed.</p>
<p>From a legal point of view, since the United States has formally declared Japan's actions as aggression, and the League of Nations has resolved to condemn Japan's invasion of China and its destruction of the Nine-Power and Non-War Treaties, then they certainly have a solid legal basis for using actions to sanction violent Japan and assist China. But in fact, it is far from this step. We must absolutely not, based on the above-mentioned facts, prematurely hold overly optimistic views of the Brussels Conference; on the contrary, according to the various news reports these past few days, we should not only not have any extravagant hopes for the conference (and of course, even less should we have any sense of reliance), but we should also greatly be on guard and prepare to resolutely respond with national unity!</p>
<p>First of all, it must be pointed out that whether Britain and the United States have truly and sincerely cooperated is a major question. They have always shirked responsibility and observed each other due to their different interests. The two sides shirked responsibility very seriously just over the issue of the convener and location of the meeting. In the recent explanation by the responsible American side regarding Roosevelt's broadcast speech, it was said that 'If the Nine-Power Treaty mediation fails, then the United States should further consider practical measures, such as severing business relations with Japan… But the US government must first obtain a guarantee that after the US suspends trade with Japan, other countries must not take the opportunity to replace it' (Havas News Agency, 13th). This was clearly speaking to Britain.</p>
<p>On the other hand, after the news of the convening of the Nine-Power Treaty conference and Anglo-American cooperation came out, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs resolutely stated that it would not participate. At the same time, the Japanese army intensified its indiscriminate bombing of the areas with the greatest British interests (Guangzhou, the Pearl River Estuary, and the Yuehan and Guangjiu Railways). A few days ago, in the airspace over the Minhang Highway, enemy planes deliberately strafed the British Embassy car. At the same time, in Europe, its fellow sufferer refused to negotiate with Britain and France on the withdrawal of volunteer troops from Spain, and openly continued to send reinforcements to Spain. It is hard to guarantee that this is not a performance of the aggressor front's diplomatic tricks, aimed at containing Britain and France. The British gentlemen, under this layer-by-layer threat, secretly tried to ease the emotions in Tokyo on the one hand, while Chamberlain publicly spoke, expressing 'a fervent desire to quickly resolve the war in the Far East', which catered to Japan's demand for a 'quick victory'. Furthermore, it was said that 'Britain's attitude has never been as moderate as it is today'; 'The British nation's nature has always been not to hold grudges against people, and after competing with any country, it can immediately release resentment and reconcile…'. These expressions are also clearly inconsistent with the informal warning from the US State Department the day before yesterday: 'The Nine-Power Treaty conference may not be able to immediately resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute: the United States does not hope to restore peace through an international shortcut'.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even if Britain and the United States have completely agreed on their attitude towards resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute, we still cannot have any extravagant hopes for the Brussels Conference. Because the British and American authorities have repeatedly stated that the sole task of this conference is to 'mediate disputes'. Since it is for the purpose of 'mediating disputes', then of course Britain, the United States, and other countries see themselves as mediators; since they are mediators, of course they cannot afford to offend both China and Japan. In this case, may I ask, is there any possibility of sanctioning aggression? In fact, Britain has already been secretly conducting this kind of 'mediation' work. The word 'aggression' was never included in the League of Nations resolution; the Soviet Union, which has particularly close relations with the Far East and is a permanent member of the League of Nations, has not been invited to participate; Chamberlain recently made speeches on 'moderation' and 'good neighborliness'; are not all these manifestations of 'mediation' behavior? What is most noteworthy is that the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at this time, suddenly changed from the previous 'resolutely not participating' to 'there is a possibility of participating'. Moreover, the conditions for participation seem to be only not to add the 'stamp of the aggressor country' (this is what the mediators have already done, why bother to feign and mention this again?). It seems that Japan's participation in the conference is very likely.</p>
<p>Naturally, from a legal point of view, we have no reason or need to oppose Japan's participation. But speaking from the specific situation, Japan's acceptance of the invitation must be for profit. And Japan's benefit must be our disadvantage. Today, when the fighting in North China is almost over, and when Shanghai needs to save face and step down, Japan is indeed willing to 'mediate'. But such mediation is extremely unfavorable to us. Such mediation is to force us to 'kneel' in a peaceful way! For this kind of mediation, we should have no other answer than to continue to strengthen our resistance to the enemy to the end!</p>
<p>In fact, the Brussels Conference was originally convened because Japan destroyed the Nine-Power Treaty and used force to invade China, so its central task should undoubtedly be to restore the Nine-Power Treaty and stop aggression. And the first article of the Nine-Power Treaty is to 'respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity of China', so the Nine-Power Treaty conference must either not be held, or once it is held, it must achieve the restoration of the entire territorial and administrative integrity of China; in other words, it must restore the state before 'September 18th'. This is the central goal that the Brussels Conference should strive for, and it is also the peace condition that we must vow to fight to the death for.</p>
<p>In short, we will definitely oppose any decision at this conference that harms our slightest territorial sovereignty with our lives. We actively advocate that this conference become a true collective security institution, using collective action to sanction aggression, and not using the face of a 'peacemaker' to attempt to 'mediate disputes'! Only in this way can the true peace of the Far East and the world be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>American Economists Estimate Losses from Shanghai War</h3>
<p>Property losses are about three times those of the January 28th Incident, and world trade is five-fourths less than usual.</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, an American economist estimates that since the start of the war in this city, property losses are about three times those of the January 28th Incident, and the losses from the reduction of Shanghai-Hong Kong trade by 80 percent have not yet been included. According to experienced observers, the total loss of Chinese industry in the January 28th Incident was between 100 million yuan and 1,560,049,871 yuan, the latter being the amount verified after detailed investigation by the director of the Chinese Statistics Office. The American estimate is about half of that. However, foreign observers today believe that the material losses suffered in this Battle of Shanghai cannot be compensated for by 300 million yuan. In addition, it is necessary to add the losses suffered from the world trade passing through this port, which is four-fifths less than usual, and the losses suffered by 90% of the total number of factory workers who are unemployed. However, the actual number can only be determined after a detailed investigation of the houses in the areas currently held by the Chinese and Japanese armies after the end of the war. During the January 28th Incident, the French Concession and the roads beyond the boundary of the International Settlement were outside the war zone, except for Yangshupu and Hongkou, which were occupied by the Japanese army. That year, from January 28 to March 1, there were only two aerial bombings, and only 212 stray bullets fell within the International Settlement that were known to the General Patrol, damaging about 262 houses. The losses suffered in the Dixwell Road area outside the boundary were not included. In this war, since the beginning of the war, the roads outside the boundary in the northeastern area have become battlefields, and bombings and fires have occurred frequently. Recently, some houses in the western area have also been affected. 65% of the total number of heavy industries and large businesses in the International Settlement are located in the above-mentioned two districts. In addition, it is still difficult to estimate the losses in Zhabei and Pudong, which are bombarded by bombs and shells every day. During the January 28th Incident, the loss of Chinese industry in Zhabei was estimated at 400 million yuan, of which private real estate accounted for about half. After the war subsided, Shanghai's commerce gradually recovered, but at that time, trade was not as completely stopped as it is now, and the war period was only one month. Now, the war has been going on for two months, and the end date is still far away, and the losses are still immeasurable. Alas, this is all the result of Japan's attempt to achieve its ambitions.</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting of Changshu Rice Transport Ship Merchants</h3>
<p>More than 300 rice transport ship merchants in Changshu, in view of the fact that 12 rice ships belonging to shipowners like Bei Jinda were illegally detained and confiscated by the Changshu County Government, although the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Local Cooperation Association, and the Civil Food Regulation Committee sent letters and telegrams to prove and negotiate, the county stubbornly clung to its own views and ignored the orders of the provincial government, and legal trade was not guaranteed, so the Changshu Rice Industry Association of this city held a temporary emergency meeting yesterday, chaired by Lu Muqin, which resolved: ㊀ Telegraph to the central ministries, departments, and commissions, etc., requesting them to follow the cold telegram of the Executive Yuan and to impose military law on the county chief officials who obstruct the transportation of grain and cheat from it, in order to demonstrate its effectiveness; ㊂ Push Shi Zufudi and Qu Renzhi to negotiate the purchase of national salvation bonds, and the meeting adjourned at 6 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Lack of Ambulance Trucks</h3>
<p>Requesting assistance from the Municipal Relief Association, the Red Swastika Society departed for the war zone yesterday.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war in Shanghai, it was originally limited to one area, and the wounded soldiers were transported to the special zone of this city, so the ambulances used by the Municipal Ambulance Association were sufficient. However, since the war zone has expanded, and more wounded soldiers need to be transported to the rear, and the journey is long, the need for ambulances has naturally increased sharply. Although the Association has tried its best to solicit donations from all walks of life and purchase them by itself, it still feels that it is insufficient. Purchasing ambulances requires a huge amount of money. Yesterday, the Association specifically requested Pan Gongzhan, chairman of the Municipal Relief Association, to approve the allocation of vehicles used by the Relief Association to send refugees to a reasonable extent for application. In addition, the Association hopes that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will actively donate or lend trucks to the Association to facilitate ambulance work and strengthen the strength of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society Rescue Team still departed for the war zone at 8 pm yesterday, and went to ×× and other places to rescue 48 wounded soldiers and send them to various hospitals for treatment. It was also heard that the Shangyu Branch of the Association ordered the Rescue Team to set up temporary clinics and shelters in ×××× and other places, and has sent more than 2,000 refugees in ten days.</p>
<h3>Huang Bodu Visits Mayor Yu Mingyu After Returning to China</h3>
<p>Going to Beijing to visit Foreign Minister Wang to report on important matters of the embassy.</p>
<p>Huang Bodu, secretary of our embassy in Japan, returned to China on the orders of Ambassador Xu to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He arrived in Shanghai by ship from Japan at 5 pm on the 16th. At 10 am yesterday, he visited Yu Ming, the director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Mayor Yu Hongjun to report. Huang will go to Beijing to pay a visit to Foreign Minister Wang in one or two days to report on his duties and report on the affairs of the return of overseas Chinese, and then return to Shanghai. The date of his return to office has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Sa Zhenbing Goes to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Sa Zhenbing, a representative of the Fujian Province to comfort the troops, came to Shanghai from Fujian a few days ago to comfort the soldiers on the front line. Now that his work in Shanghai is completed, he boarded the Taikoo Company's Jinan ship at 2 pm yesterday and left Shanghai for Hong Kong at 6 am this morning, and then went to Nanyang. Sa plans to stay in Nanyang for two months to promote and solicit national salvation donations.</p>
<h3>Chen Guangyuan, Member of the Youth Service Corps, Dies in Action</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Vocational Youth Wartime Service Corps Rescue First Team, led by Captain Cheng Jianfeng, set off for the front line with the ×× Regiment of the ×× Division on September 27, and its service performance was very good, and it was highly valued by the military authorities. Unfortunately, a member of the team, Chen Guangyuan, was shot in a vital point by an enemy machine gun while rescuing the wounded on the front line on the 13th of this month, and died in action. Chen was originally employed at the Chuanguzhai Antique Shop on Jiangxi Road. After his death in action, all the members of the Corps expressed their indignation and hated the brutal behavior of the enemy army.</p>
<h3>American Transport Ship Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>At 4:20 pm yesterday, an American military transport ship, the Chaumont, arrived in Shanghai and docked at the Xinguang Wharf. It was heard that the ship was ordered to transport military supplies from South China to Shanghai, so it will leave Shanghai after the unloading is completed.</p>
<h3>Ambulance Team Member Sun Jingye Dies in the Line of Duty</h3>
<p>The ambulance team belonging to the Chinese Youth Resistance to Japan and National Salvation Corps has all been serving on the front line. A part of them are working in the ×× Division Headquarters. On the afternoon of the 15th, while they were carrying wounded soldiers on stretchers, they were discovered by the enemy, who immediately strafed them with machine guns. At that time, a member of the team, Sun Jingye, 20 years old, from outside the South Gate of Wuxi, was shot and his leg bones were broken. Although he was given first aid and bandaged, he died tragically at 6 am the next morning due to excessive bleeding. After Sun Jingye was injured, he held the hand of his comrade and exhorted, 'Serve the country, work hard, I am leaving, take care, work hard'. Such a spirit of loyalty and courage is truly admirable, and the brutal act of the Japanese killing ambulance team members is even more hateful.</p>

<h3>Female Workers in Refugee Factories Register Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>Dozens of people were hired by various yarn factories.</p>
<p>It has been reported by the United Charity Association of this city, the Emergency Refugee Relief Association, and other groups that the Shanghai West United Benefit Association is currently organizing the registration of female yarn factory workers. It is appropriate that there are many skilled female yarn factory workers in various refugee camps, but most of them are not aware of this, so they have been separately notified to pay attention and go to register in order to seek a way out. The International Refugee Relief Association, sponsored by the YMCA, has also dispatched a large number of female refugee workers to register with the Association. More than a dozen people have been examined and qualified and have been hired by various yarn factories to work. As a result, the registration work of the Association has become more and more busy, and the total number has exceeded three to four hundred.</p>

Forty-nine directors attended the meeting and resolved: ㊀ To establish an inland work liaison committee to contact and launch national salvation associations of occupational circles throughout the country; ㊁ To call on the citizens of this city to carry out the winter coal-saving movement; ㊂ To request the government to immediately sever diplomatic relations with Japan, and to organize an information network for economic severance with Japan, so as to serve as the eyes and ears of the National Economic Severance Association; ㊃ To continue to elect Zhu Jing'an, Yang Bogeng, Luo Qinghua and other nine people as directors.</p>

<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Sets a Deadline for Registering Newspapers and Magazines</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau of this city, in accordance with the revised Publishing Law, handles the registration of newspapers and magazines in this city.

<h3>The Jianghai Customs Sets a Deadline for Collecting Tax Refund Vouchers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Jianghai Customs Commissioner issued Announcement No. 1617, stating that all tax refund vouchers approved for issuance from January 1, 1934 to December 31, have not yet been claimed, and the deadline for claiming them from the Customs is January 1, 1938. Those who fail to do so will be cancelled. Those who have already received checks but have not cashed them must also be cashed at the bank before January 31, 1938. Those who fail to do so will also be invalidated.</p>
<h3>Coming and Going Amidst Bombings</h3>
<p>— Guo Moruo</p>
<p>Nine</p>
<p>Ji Xing’s home was at a certain number on P Road, a two-story Western-style building. In the front yard’s lawn, two air-raid shelters had already been dug, but when she took me upstairs, she pointed to an earthen mound directly opposite the house, as tall as the upstairs window, and said to me, “Beneath that earthen hill, we’ve also dug an earthen bunker, with over two zhang of loose earth on top. Whenever an alarm sounds, we rush in there to take cover.”</p>
<p>Then she told me about the alarm system, which, she said, used whistles. When enemy planes came, there would be a first alarm, and when the enemy planes got closer, there would be a second, urgent alarm. When the first alarm sounded, they would prepare to take shelter, and when the second alarm sounded, they would all go into the air-raid shelter. When the enemy planes had gone far away, another whistle would indicate that the alarm was over.</p>
<p>Hearing these words, I felt as if I were listening to a fairy tale, because people living in the concessions had never undergone such training.</p>
<p>After settling down, I spent a day busy receiving friends and visiting friends. One fellow townsman praised me, saying that I had done very well, that others would spend ten days and still worry about not establishing good ‘relations’, but I had established them in one day. I don’t know whether I should accept this praise, or whether my friends should.</p>
<p>At four o’clock in the afternoon, I called Zhang Yuejun to report my arrival. He invited me to his residence to talk.</p>
<p>After handing in my card, I was led into a parlor.</p>
<p>Yuejun came out wearing a blue silk robe, and we shook hands.</p>
<p>“Ten years! It’s been a full ten years. … Ma Boyuan used to see me often, and he would talk about you, saying that your life was very hard. … He also mentioned wanting to ask friends to donate many books to you to help your research. But I was worried that you wouldn’t accept them. … How are your family members? Have you heard from them recently?”</p>
<p>He spoke in a Sichuan accent that hadn’t completely faded, talking at length.</p>
<p>“This May, at Lushan, I talked about you with Mu Yin, Gong Qia, Cui Lian, and others. We all wanted to invite you back. But we hesitated a bit about canceling the arrest warrant, because if it had been canceled earlier, I was afraid you wouldn’t have been able to leave Japan.”</p>
<p>Hearing these frank and heartfelt words really made me feel grateful. I hadn’t imagined that so many friends cared about me. But it seems that my friends overestimated me. Although my life was ‘hard’, it wasn’t very ‘pure’; in fact, it was so hard that I was quite overwhelmed. It’s all in the past now, so I might as well talk about it here.</p>
<p>I remember that eight years ago, when Chinese money was at its lowest value, there was a period when three silver dollars could barely be exchanged for one Japanese yen. At that time, even though I was wielding a pen, writing from morning till night, the Chinese money I sent back to China to sell could only be exchanged for a small number of Japanese old-man notes. There were several months when a family of six had to live on forty or fifty yen in old-man notes per month (roughly the average living expenses for a student studying in Japan).</p>
<p>What I can’t forget is my ‘Comprehensive Compilation of Inscriptions on Bronzes from the Zhou Dynasties’, the result of two years of research. I wrote to the Commercial Press to offer it for sale, but I was rejected. I asked Yenching University and the Academia Sinica, but they also had no interest. I had no choice but to ask a bookstore in Tokyo, Japan. The bookstore owner was only willing to give me three hundred yen in royalties. I thought it was a bit too little, because it was unlikely that the book would be reprinted. The owner said, “You have to understand, three hundred yen is equivalent to more than seven hundred Chinese dollars.” Although these words hurt my dignity a bit, they also struck my weakest point. Although I hesitated for half a month, I finally took the book and exchanged it for three hundred yen in old-man notes. From then on, my archaeological works were published one after another in Japan. As a result, rumors spread in China about how Duke Saionji had treated me and how the Japanese government had treated me, and I was almost labeled a traitor.</p>
<p>Separated by only the East China Sea, our understanding of Japan is inexplicably so distant. I can frankly say a few more words. It is true that Duke Saionji read my book, and it is also true that he praised it to others, but he and I had no direct relationship whatsoever. I don’t want to use him to elevate my status, nor do I want to use me to elevate his status. He is indeed a Japanese elder statesman and a respected international politician, but when it comes to the study of ancient artifacts, he is ultimately just one of my readers.</p>
<p>As for the Japanese officials and scholars, they initially regarded me as a drowned chicken and my writings as chicken droppings in the water. However, when their elder statesman praised me and the academic circles in Western Europe also responded, they changed their tune. They were truly the most snobbish people!</p>
<p>I’m afraid the Japanese are the most snobbish people in the world. Some so-called ‘China scholars’ who study Chinese learning can’t even read Chinese without misinterpreting it, but in their minds, they thoroughly despise the Chinese. But when they encounter the rampant writings of Western ‘China scholars’, they revere them as precious treasures, bowing and scraping, always saying ‘Maspelo said’ or ‘Karlgren said’. Isn’t this the same national character as the Japanese military distributing leaflets in Shanghai, declaring that they want to fight the Chinese Communist Party, while at the same time the Japanese Emperor is feasting the Soviet ambassador?</p>
<p>“I’ve been practically specializing in being a secretary-general lately,” Yuejun said to me.</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m the secretary-general of the Political Council, I’m the secretary-general of ××××, and I’m also the secretary-general of the Military Affairs Commission. One person holding three secretary-generalships.”</p>
<p>I felt that China had too few talented people, and that the capable ones were overworked. After hearing Yuejun’s words, that’s what I thought, but I didn’t say it.</p>

<h3>Britain Refuses to Participate in the World Games, Our Sports Community Acts in Unison</h3>
<p>Sports Salvation Association Issues Declaration, Seeking National Comrades to Unite and Strive</p>
<p>Since the British International League of Comrades and the British Sports Association proposed refusing to participate in the 1940 World Games in Tokyo, the sports community of this city has expressed its deep gratitude and warmly supports the British people. It is reported that the Sports Salvation Association, which is being organized, has not only sent a letter to the National Sports Association suggesting an immediate telegram to the British League of Comrades and the British Sports Association in response, but also issued a declaration and organizational outline yesterday, seeking unified action from comrades in the national sports community. The declaration reads: To all newspaper offices and news agencies nationwide, and to all comrades in the sports community: Ever since the powerful enemy invaded our territory and our government declared a full-scale war of resistance, all compatriots across the country have shared the same hatred of the enemy and have worked hard to save the nation, hoping to strengthen the government's external resistance efforts under a unified front. We in the sports community are also a part of the nation, and we have always taken it as our duty to promote sports and revitalize the nation. If we hesitate and falter at this time and do not strive to rise up, we fear we will be laughed at by our neighbors. Now that the British sports community sympathizes with our country's resistance against Japan and refuses to participate in the 1940 World Games in Tokyo, how should our country's sports community express its gratitude and warmly respond to the British people? Moreover, the Japanese, in the past, wanted to have the puppet state of Manchukuo participate in the competition, and did not hesitate to offend public anger by illegally dissolving our Far Eastern Games organization. This hatred and resentment still fill the hearts of those in the sports community. We all belong to the nation, and how can we remain silent? Therefore, without fear of hardship, we resolutely launched the China Sports Salvation Association, hoping to gather ideas and unite our strength, so that under a complete and close organization, we can fully unleash the fearless spirit of our sports community. The future of the nation truly depends on this. We hereby declare.</p>
<h3>Stamp Tax Regulations During Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Explains Points to Note</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance stipulated the Provisional Measures for the Collection of Stamp Tax During Extraordinary Times, and the City Chamber of Commerce published it in the newspaper on the 16th of this month, all businesses and shops should comply with the regulations. In addition to doubling all tax rates, there are other points that should be noted. According to the secretariat of the City Chamber of Commerce, the following are some points to note: ㊀ The original tax rates for three types of documents – delivery slips, receipts for money and goods, and bills – started at three yuan. Now, it has been changed to start at one yuan. That is, one cent is to be affixed for every one yuan, two cents for three yuan, four cents for ten yuan, and six cents for one hundred yuan. No further stamps are to be affixed. ㊁ Account books, according to the tax law, should be affixed with two jiao per book per year. According to the provisional measures for extraordinary times, four jiao should be affixed. If the stamps have already been affixed in the past, there is no need to affix additional stamps. However, account books that are opened now, as well as account books starting from the 27th year, should all be affixed with four jiao. ㊂ Article 16 of the original tax law stipulated that the maximum stamp tax affixed to each document should not exceed twenty yuan. This limit has now been deleted. For example, for a contract worth 500,000 yuan, according to the original tax law, two cents should be affixed for every 100 yuan, so 500,000 yuan should have been affixed with 100 yuan, but only the maximum amount of 20 yuan was required. Now, according to the extraordinary times measures, the stamp tax is doubled, that is, four cents should be affixed for every 100 yuan, so 500,000 yuan should be affixed with 200 yuan. However, property insurance policies are still limited to three yuan because this limit has not been changed in the provisional measures for extraordinary times. ㊃ Petitions, applications, appeals, guarantees, written pledges, and affidavits should now revert to the previous stamp tax regulations, with each document requiring two jiao. However, official documents from trade associations to the Chamber of Commerce do not need to be stamped, because, in terms of official document formats, petitions are not necessary. ㊄ The City Chamber of Commerce is currently rushing to print pamphlets on stamp affixing methods after the implementation of the provisional measures, so that the business community can use them as a basis for compliance.</p>
<h3>Another Batch of Overseas Chinese Returning from Japan Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau and Others Send Personnel to Receive Them, Ningbo Compatriots Return Home Today</p>
<p>One hundred and ten overseas Chinese returning from Japan, including Zhang Wenbin, Wang Anshun, and Yan Nengjun, consisting of sixty-seven from Kobe and forty-three from Yokohama, arrived at the Wusongkou on a French mail ship at 3:00 PM yesterday. The overseas Chinese were transferred to barges and landed at the New Customs Wharf. Upon hearing the news, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau and the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association sent personnel Liu Zhuchu (Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau) and Liang Zhuoren and Ye Xianggao (Ningbo Association) to receive them. Among the batch of overseas Chinese, besides some Ningbo compatriots who embarked from Kobe and went to relatives and friends on their own, fifteen Ningbo people including Guo Qingsheng and others who arrived in Shanghai from Yokohama were housed by the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association. Other overseas Chinese from other regions were all accommodated by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, and the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association provided accommodation. Because it was too late to take a ship back to Ningbo on the same day, they were escorted to the Asia Hotel on Avenue Edward VII and provided with rooms for the night. After the association’s committee member Cheng Zixiang contacted the hotel’s owner Sun Qiuping, Mr. Sun stated that it was his duty to provide accommodations for the returning overseas Chinese and refused to accept any room charges, which is truly commendable. It is reported that the Ningbo compatriots are scheduled to return to Ningbo on the Endeavor ship today, with the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association providing the tickets.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Illegally Uses Poison Gas at Shatangqiao, Our Soldiers Receive Treatment by Bloodletting After Being Poisoned</h3>
<p>— (International Press)</p>
<h3>Please Pay Out Legal Tender for Remittances to the Interior</h3>
<p>In Order to Develop Resources and Maintain the Livelihood of Farmers and Merchants</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing regarding the matter of remitting deposits to the interior to purchase goods. The telegram stated: “Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, regarding the letter from the Tong Oil and Ramie Industry Association on the 15th of this month, stating that members of the association, such as Xu Yuanlai, Yong Chengyuan, Heng Xiangjin, and Heng Hezheng, jointly proposed using Shanghai’s prevalent zhuangpiao or bank drafts when new tung oil enters the market. They would entrust banks here to remit to various producing areas in Zhejiang Province, such as Hangzhou, Jinhua, and Yanzhou, to withdraw legal tender, and purchase as much tung oil as possible for supply to overseas markets. In recent years, tung oil has been at the top of the list of native product exports, and it is the foundation of our industry’s business operations. Now, the new tung oil from Zhejiang has been harvested by farmers for a long time, and the producing areas are reporting bumper harvests and accumulation. There is nowhere without requests to go to purchase and sell. We should try to go and purchase in a timely manner. However, farmers will not sell unless they receive cash, and merchants need legal tender for transportation and turnover. In this extraordinary period, since the Ministry of Finance restricted the payment of legal tender in Shanghai’s financial system, banks will not remit unless they have cash. Even though members have funds deposited in banks, they cannot use them in a timely manner for the livelihood of their businesses, resulting in goods accumulating in the countryside and merchants stopping in the city, causing distress for both farmers and merchants. They requested immediate discussion and relief. The members of the association unanimously decided that, because the matter concerns the livelihood of farmers and the growth of businesses, they would request the association to earnestly request the Ministry of Finance to approve and order the Central Bank of China, the China Bank, and the Agricultural Bank of China to allow the association to be responsible for providing proof and to remit and withdraw legal tender as usual to maintain the livelihood of farmers and merchants. We have recorded the case and submitted it for your consideration, and we respectfully request that you instruct and implement it accordingly. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce respectfully requests. We find that the banks' refusal to remit without cash is to fully implement the purpose of restricting deposits and withdrawals, to avoid using the name of remittances to disguise withdrawals. However, according to the association's statement, this fund is for remittance to the interior of Zhejiang Province for the purchase of native products. The flow of funds into the interior is precisely for the development of resources and the support of farmers and workers. It is the same as restricting withdrawals to prevent funds from fleeing. The intention is the same, the traces are seemingly opposite, but the situation is actually complementary. Recent commentators have argued that remittances from the interior to the city should still be handled according to the current method, while remittances from the city to the interior should generally be paid out in legal tender. This is the intention. We should send a telegram to your department for review and approval, and immediately change the method of operation by issuing a clear order, so that the livelihood of the interior will be revived, and the strength of the country to resist aggression will be increased. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce respectfully requests."</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods Organizations Guide Factories to Resume Operations</h3>
<p>To Facilitate the Sale of Domestic Goods</p>
<p>Many domestic goods factories in this city have been suspended due to the war, which not only affects the livelihood of workers but also weakens the strength of the overall war of resistance. The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods believes that this situation violates the meaning of saving the country through production and must find ways to guide them to resume operations. It is reported that a meeting has been held and fifteen people, including Yu Qiaqing, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaoxie, Zhu Xuefan, Hu Xiyuan, Shao Daren, and Fang Jiange, have been selected as committee members to specifically handle the resumption of operations of various domestic goods factories. A work outline has been formulated, and contact has been made with various domestic goods organizations to strive to solve various difficulties in the resumption of operations of domestic goods factories. In addition, domestic goods transportation and sales certificates will be issued to facilitate the sale of domestic goods. Whether members or non-members, free services will be provided. In addition to filing with the competent authorities, the association has also notified all domestic goods factories in the city to contact the association's office at No. 715, Continental Arcade, Nanjing Road.</p>
<h3>Use Matchboxes and Cigarette Packages to Promote Resistance Against the Enemy</h3>
<p>Print Simple Characters and Paintings, or Nursery Rhymes and Slogans, etc.</p>
<p>The Propaganda Department of the Central Party Headquarters believes that this full-scale war of resistance against Japan is a struggle for our nation's survival. If the emotions of the loyal and courageous soldiers fighting at the front and the enthusiasm of the people in the rear for material assistance are not promoted as much as possible, it will not be enough to be widespread and deeply rooted among the people. Now, it has specially drafted a method of economical propaganda, using the bottom and both ends of matchboxes and the sides of cigarette paper packages, to print as much as possible the most simple characters or paintings, nursery rhymes, or slogans for resisting the enemy, so that the people can understand them at a glance and imprint them in their minds, in order to facilitate propaganda and remember them. It has already telegraphed the governments of various provinces, cities, and counties to instruct the local match guilds and cigarette industry associations to forward them to various manufacturers to print accordingly when manufacturing goods. It has also set a deadline of one month for the goods department to inspect. All match and cigarette goods must have this kind of anti-enemy slogan printed on them before they can be transported and sold.</p>
<h3>Measures for Dealing with the Silk Industry in Economic Severance with Japan</h3>
<p>Notify Members to Fill Out Registration Forms, Everyone Should Act with Conscience and Sever Ties with the Enemy</p>
<p>After the National Economic Severance Committee Against Japan in this city was formally established on the 9th of this month, various tasks are being actively promoted in accordance with the prescribed scope. According to a report by a reporter from Xin Xin News Agency, the Shanghai Silk Industry Association has specifically decided on measures for dealing with the stock and materials of its members and has sent letters to its members for their information and compliance. The original letter stated: "Regarding the issue of economic severance with Japan, the association has discussed and decided on measures for dealing with the stock and materials of its members: ㊀ Investigating stock, ㊀ Registering raw materials, etc. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby send a special letter, hoping that you will check all the stock in your company, whether it is native goods or foreign goods, and whether or not there are raw materials, and send personnel to our association to collect forms on the next day after receiving this letter, fill them out according to the format, and send them to the association for registration by the deadline. We will send personnel to check, and the new transshipment tax regulations state that customs attach importance to kilograms for silk goods, so it is necessary to indicate the total weight of the stock in kilograms in the remarks column of the registration book, so that it can be deducted gradually when shipping out. After that, for new goods, the weight in kilograms should also be filled in accurately according to the quality, so that there is a basis for filling in the documents when shipping out. From now on, all our members should act with conscience and sever all economic ties with the enemy. If they are greedy for profit and forget their roots and buy and sell enemy goods, they will be cut off from the Chinese people. Please pay attention. We wish you good health."</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Eradicate Defeatist Thought</h3>
<p>— Appropriate</p>
<p>Recent victories on all fronts have greatly increased the optimism of the nation regarding the prospects of the war of resistance. However, we must still be wary that the idea of defeatism has not disappeared from among our compatriots.</p>
<p>Our country is the invaded and oppressed. We have always exposed our weaknesses and hidden our strengths. The enemy country, on the other hand, is the invader and oppressor, always displaying its strengths and hiding its weaknesses. Therefore, superficial knowledge often suggests to our compatriots that we cannot win against the enemy. This is the root of defeatist thought.</p>
<p>Defeatist thought not only harms the country but also poisons oneself. The most obvious examples are Huang Jun, who sold intelligence and was executed, and Li Fuying, who abandoned key positions and was executed. If these two had not been deeply poisoned by defeatist thought, such outcomes would not have occurred.</p>
<p>Conversely, as long as we can overcome defeatist thought, temporary setbacks will lead to even greater victories in the future. Consider the entire Luo regiment martyred at Nankou and the entire Yao battalion killed in action at Baoshan. On the surface, these may seem like failures. In reality, such heroic sacrifices made an unparalleled contribution to the country. Not to mention the significant strength the enemy expended at Nankou and Baoshan, the improvement in the current situation in Shanxi Province and the consolidation of the Shanghai defense line are clearly due to the heroic spirit of those soldiers in the early stages of the war who refused to retreat until death.</p>
<p>I hope all compatriots deeply understand that this war of resistance is, in its fundamental sense, a national revolution. And the creed of revolution is only victory, not defeat. Whenever and wherever defeatist thought arises, we must do everything we can to eradicate it.</p>

<h3>Enemy Forces Fiercely Attack Our Left Flank Position, Unprecedented Fierce Battle on the Chenjiaxiang Front</h3>
<p>The alert line in the Shenjiazhai area was breached by the enemy. Fierce battles occurred in Maqiaozhai and Gejiapailouzhai. Our reinforcements have arrived and will not find it difficult to expel the stubborn enemy.</p>
<p>The enemy forces continued to concentrate their firepower and fiercely attacked our left flank position, hoping to break through our line from Dachang to Nanxiang. However, due to our close interception, they were unable to succeed. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy again launched an attack from Liuhang towards our front line at Chenjiaxiang, using fierce artillery fire and dense shooting. Our army fought back valiantly, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The fierce battle continued until dawn this morning, when the enemy's firepower proved too strong. The enemy breached our positions at Shenjiazhai, Zhusanfang, and Caijiatang in front of Chenjiaxiang. Our army, defending the line from the south of Dunwusi Temple to Chenjiaxiang, launched a pincer attack on the enemy. The fierce battle continued until noon. Our elite reinforcements have rapidly arrived and are launching a vigorous counterattack. It should not be difficult to repel the stubborn enemy and recover the original alert positions. The enemy west of Tangqiao and along the Wenzaobang also advanced towards our position at the same time. The enemy artillery from Liuhang concentrated its firepower to bombard Zhangwanzhai, Louxia, and Maojiazhai near Fengcuntang, in order to contain our army on the Chenjiaxiang line. However, our strength there is strong, with deep trenches and high fortifications. We calmly responded to the battle and remained unmoved. At Maqiaozhai, about 1,500 meters south of the highway along Tangqiao, and at Gejiapailouzhai, about 1,000 meters west of Maqiaozhai, the fortifications were slightly damaged due to heavy enemy artillery fire, and the enemy made a slight advance. Our army is currently carrying out a close interception. There were no fierce battles on the Jiangwan-Miaoxing line last night. There were only occasional minor conflicts east of Baoshan Road along North Sichuan Road, with no special changes. However, at Baziqiao, a small group of enemy troops launched an attack on us at 4:00 this morning, but were immediately repelled by us. There were no changes last night or this morning on the line from north of Guangfuzhen to Shixianggong Temple and Caowang Temple.</p>
<h3>Bloody Battle at Gejiapailou for Twenty-Four Hours</h3>
<p>Our Regiment Commander Qin, wounded, supervises the battle, boosting morale. The entire regiment of 1,400 officers and soldiers heroically sacrificed their lives. The enemy suffered more than 3,000 casualties, and the ditches were stained red with blood.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the enemy on the south bank of the Wenzaobang, west of the Shanghai-Tai Road, was unwilling to accept their defeat on the 12th. After reorganizing their defeated troops, they launched another large-scale attack to the southeast on the night of the 14th. Our army defended key points west of the Shanghai-Tai Road and on the north bank of Fengcuntang, calmly responding to the battle. Thus, a bloody battle unfolded 1,400 meters deep and 2,400 meters wide on the south bank of the Bang and the north bank of the Tang, with each side attacking with all their might. The fierce battle has continued for three days and nights, and has not yet stopped. According to a report from our agency's war correspondent stationed in Jiangwan at 11:00 a.m. on the 18th, "The enemy troops, taking advantage of their fierce artillery fire, gradually advanced and gathered in the Bashiqiaozhai area. Yesterday morning, they again concentrated heavy artillery fire on the Gejiapailou area, while more than 20 aircraft continuously dropped bombs. A large number of enemy troops, led by many tanks, charged fiercely at our position. Our army, under the command of Regiment Commander Qin Qingwu, bravely counterattacked. At about 9:00 a.m. yesterday, Regiment Commander Qin, leading by example, was unfortunately hit by a stray bullet. His subordinates advised him to retreat to the rear for medical treatment, but Regiment Commander Qin firmly refused, vowing to live or die with the position. The entire army was inspired, morale greatly boosted, and they immediately rushed out of the trenches to launch a counterattack against the enemy. They fought the enemy with flesh and blood. The enemy suffered numerous casualties, and we also suffered heavy losses. The fierce battle lasted until 5:00 p.m. Regiment Commander Qin's entire regiment, including Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang Jilin, Ou Xin, and Battalion Commander Liu Yan, all made heroic sacrifices. Only Regiment Commander Qin and 12 others remained, still holding the position under artillery fire, waiting for friendly reinforcements. However, due to the constant harassment of enemy aircraft, reinforcements could not arrive, and the enemy continued to attack, causing our remaining 12 men to all die with the position. Gejiapailou also fell into enemy hands. At 6:00 p.m. at nightfall, a large number of our reinforcements arrived and immediately launched a counterattack. The enemy's position was not stable, and after our fierce attack, they retreated within two hours. Our army recovered Gejiapailou. However, the enemy continued to attack, advancing and retreating many times. After midnight, we temporarily retreated to the Huguozhai, Huangjiaxiang, and Chenjiazhai areas, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. Today, enemy aircraft and artillery continue to bombard us, but there has been no contact between the troops. Although our sacrifices in this battle were great, with the entire regiment of 1,400 officers and soldiers dying with the position, it was a tragic and heroic event unprecedented in history. However, the enemy suffered more than 3,000 casualties, with corpses scattered across the field and the ditches stained red with blood."</p>
<h3>The Enemy Again Attacks Jiangwan and Zhabei</h3>
<p>One attack targeted Zhizhi University, one targeted Sichuan Highway. We inflicted heavy blows separately, and the enemy collapsed and retreated.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent in Jiangwan reported at 1:00 p.m. today that at 6:30 p.m. last night, about two companies of enemy troops in the area of the Patriotic Girls' School on Jiangwan Road began to move. Our army learned of this and immediately took active precautions. At about 2:00 a.m. this morning, the enemy divided its forces into two groups. One group, about two companies, attacked the area of Qujiaqiao, Guangzhong Road, and Zhizhi University. Before the enemy approached, our army used mortars and shrapnel to bombard them fiercely. The roaring sound shocked the surroundings. After more than two hours of bloody battle, more than 70 enemy soldiers were killed. After the enemy retreated, at about 4:00 a.m., we attacked the enemy's position at the Patriotic Girls' School with a small detachment. The enemy, having suffered losses, did not dare to attack and was extremely uneasy under our attack. Another group of enemy troops, about one company, attacked our position on Sichuan Highway. Our army, having prepared in advance, waited for the enemy to approach and then jumped out of the trenches to inflict heavy blows. After more than an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy again collapsed and retreated to its original position. In this battle, more than 30 enemy soldiers were also killed.</p>

They swooped down and took turns dropping more than a dozen bombs. At the same time, our army also aimed at the location of our aircraft and bombarded fiercely with mortars and shrapnel. The enemy squadron was almost completely wiped out. At dawn today, there were more than 100 enemy corpses on the opposite bank of the Baoshan Paper Factory, which had not yet been dragged away.</p>

The enemy troops immediately collapsed and retreated, and many were killed by our army's swords and guns. At about 4:30 a.m. this morning, the enemy, with the support of reinforcements, reorganized its remnants and attacked our newly established stronghold. At that time, our army used dense machine gun fire to strafe the enemy. The enemy stubbornly resisted, but after our army bravely and fiercely suppressed them, they finally retreated in defeat. The enemy suffered dozens more casualties. At 9:00 a.m. this morning, our army, considering that the newly established stronghold was too large a target and easily susceptible to air raids, returned to its original position and held fast. The enemy never dared to attack again.</p>

<h3>Enemy Aircraft Again Indiscriminately Bomb in All Directions Yesterday</h3>
<p>Burning civilian houses and killing civilians, inhumane.</p>
<p>Bombing in Zhabei causes fires.</p>
<p>Starting at around 6:00 a.m. on the 18th, enemy aircraft in squadrons hovered over various locations in Zhabei and indiscriminately opened machine gun fire, with bullets flying everywhere, landing on the cement platform on the roof of the Dashun South Goods Store at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Meibaik Road. From 6:30 to 7:00, six enemy aircraft dropped approximately 30 bombs over Zhabei, northwest of the Shanghai-Tai Road and Zhongshan Road, but most of them landed in the mud in the fields and did not explode. Only six or seven exploded. At the same time, three enemy aircraft also dropped more than a dozen bombs in the Song Park area, but only half of them exploded. The bombs all landed south of Liuying Road. From 8:00 to 8:20, two enemy aircraft flew to the section of Suzhou River from Wuzhen Road Bridge to the Sampan Factory New Bridge, then turned west and flew east, dropping four bombs over the Xinzha Bridge, landing west of Chang'an Road and Hengfeng Road, destroying many civilian houses, which immediately caught fire and have not been extinguished this morning.

The aircraft then flew low and indiscriminately fired machine guns, for about a quarter of an hour, before circling into the sky. The enemy dropped absurd leaflets in the surrounding area, but people who picked up the leaflets tore them up in anger. The leaflets were yellow and white, and their contents were no different from those that foreign reporters raised at the enemy's reception earlier.</p>
<h3>British Labour Party and Trade Union Hold Anti-Japanese Rally</h3>
<p>Strongly advocated for economic sanctions against Japan. Demanded that the government ban the transport of military supplies to Japan in London.</p>
<p>The opposition Labour Party's London branch and the London Trades Council executive committee held a rally this afternoon at Trafalgar Square to oppose Japan's invasion of China. More than 10,000 people participated. Major Attlee, leader of the Labour Party's parliamentary group in the House of Commons, and Green wood, one of the party's leaders, also a member of parliament, both gave impassioned speeches, advocating for a boycott of Japanese goods and demanding that "the British government take action." A resolution was then passed stating that "we deeply abhor the Japanese military's 'slaughter of innocent Chinese civilians.'" If other countries continue to tacitly approve of this type of warfare, the safety of the people of those countries and the future of human civilization will both be in great danger. "We hereby demand that the British government prohibit its citizens from selling military supplies to Japan or lending money to Japan." Attlee's speech stated, "The Japanese government is in a very vulnerable economic position. Japan relies on foreign trade for its economic lifeline. The British Empire, including the self-governing territories and colonies, and the United States account for a large part of its trade with Japan. The people of Britain and the United States only need to take individual action to economically pressure Japan, and the Japanese government will feel a significant impact. The joint rescue society has already initiated a movement to boycott Japanese goods. We only need to follow in its footsteps. The government can also imitate this."

<h3>Our Aircraft Launch Night Raids, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy</h3>
<p>At the same time, artillery from two directions joined in the bombardment. The enemy's rear base suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>On the night of the 17th, our air force launched night raids on Shanghai. The first time was from 6:50 p.m. to 7:26 p.m., dropping several bombs. One bomb hit the southeastern corner of the two-story building of the Sabbath Church on Bazilu. A certain house at No. 525 Ningguo Road was hit and caught fire, completely destroyed. One bomb each landed in the open areas of the Asia Steel Factory and the Japanese-owned First Soap Factory on Henan Road. Afterwards, from 10:23 p.m. to 10:35 p.m., 12:37 a.m. to 1:05 a.m. this morning, 1:53 a.m. to 2:05 a.m., and 2:15 a.m. to 2:45 a.m., our military aircraft continued to bomb the enemy's base in Hongkou. Five bombs fell in the Huishan area, causing heavy losses to the enemy. The enemy indiscriminately fired anti-aircraft guns in attack, with shrapnel flying everywhere. Shrapnel and anti-aircraft shells landed at Weihaiwei Road, Longmen Road, and Wangjiasha Garden, but fortunately no one was injured. A Chinese man on Baker Road was injured by a stray bullet.</p>
<p>The command deck of the Izumo was destroyed.</p>
<p>The Dagong Daily reports reliable news that the command deck of the enemy flagship "Izumo," anchored on the river at the Gonghexiang Wharf, was destroyed last night by our brave air force. Commander Hasegawa and Izumo Captain Iwamura were also said to be seriously injured. When our brave air force came to Shanghai for the third time at 12:30 a.m. this morning, they dropped two bombs on the Japanese consulate area. One of the bombs landed in the river, while the other hit the enemy's Navy Cruiser No. 1, anchored next to the Izumo. The front of the ship was immediately destroyed. After the bomb exploded, a large piece of shrapnel hit the command deck of the Izumo. With a crash, the bulletproof steel plate and command room on the deck were destroyed. Hasegawa and Captain Iwamura, who were commanding the enemy's operations on the deck at the time, were caught off guard and were both seriously injured at the same time. They have now been sent to a certain hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Artillery from two directions joined in the bombardment.</p>
<p>At around 6:00 p.m. last night, an enemy cruiser anchored outside the new Mitsui pier in Pudong suddenly opened fire and bombarded the Pudong positions, continuously firing more than 30 rounds, with a very loud sound. They also used machine guns to strafe the shore, attempting to send small boats to collect coal. Our military immediately returned fire with fierce machine gun fire, preventing them from achieving their goal. At 7:00, when our air force arrived in Shanghai, the warship turned its attention to defending against the air raids. Afterwards, enemy warships in the Huangpu River only fired sparsely and put on a show of force, fearing our aircraft bombing. At around midnight, when our air force returned to Shanghai again, the ×× heavy artillery team and the ×× artillery team fired at the same time, launching a pincer attack. At this time, land and air forces acted in unison, and the powerful firepower of Pudong posed a significant threat to the enemy. The enemy warships, preoccupied with defending against the aircraft, had no time to respond, firing only six or seven rounds in return. Our military fired approximately 60 or 70 rounds in half an hour, destroying much of the enemy's fortifications in the important Hongkou positions. Having suffered heavy losses, the enemy did not launch a retaliatory bombardment on Pudong until dawn, after our air force had left. Our military was unwilling to remain silent and returned fire, with both sides firing more than 30 rounds before stopping. This morning, senior commanders of our military praised the Pudong artillery team for their great achievements and issued a special commendation.</p>
<h3>Casual Commentary</h3>
<p>— A Phase</p>
<p>This long-term resistance war of our country was originally beyond the enemy's expectations. What the enemy anticipated was as follows:</p>
<p>In North China, they had already reached a compromise by employing political means or intimidation, without the need for military force. As for the central government, there were figures like Huang Qiuyue, who constantly transmitted information, creating a very strong atmosphere of peace, and opposing the use of force. As for the Shanghai front, they believed that even if there were battles, with heavy troops pressing the border, it could be resolved in a few hours or a day or two. Moreover, they deeply knew that the spirit of various parties in our country was not united and our strength was not sufficient, so we were just like something in a pocket. Therefore, the enemy believed that they had a unique chance of victory in this invasion of our country and were extremely confident.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the steady jar was shattered, and their observation was completely wrong. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred, and Feng Zhi'an did not buy their account, resolutely resisting. This led to Tadashi's previous efforts being completely wasted and he was unable to explain it, hence the rumor of his suicide. This is the first thing that the Japanese did not anticipate. The central government, which initially advocated a peaceful resolution, suddenly changed to active resistance. This is the second thing that the enemy did not anticipate. And the Shanghai front, which the enemy thought could be resolved in a few hours or a day or two, has not been resolved for more than two months, and the magnitude of the losses can hardly be calculated with numbers. This is the third thing that the enemy did not anticipate. The enemy believed that our country's spirit was not united and our strength was not sufficient. Now, regardless of party affiliation, regardless of each other, the whole country is united in resisting the enemy. This is the fourth thing that the enemy did not anticipate. At this point, the enemy knew that things had gone wrong and could not be salvaged. They were filled with frustration, but it was difficult to back down. This is truly the enemy's dilemma. As for the international community, they were also extremely indignant, and calls for sanctions against tyranny rose like clouds and wind. And the enemy's combat power was also fully exposed. The retribution for warmongering is about to be seen. I wonder if the enemy is aware of this?</p>

<h3>Zhu and Peng Today (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Central News Agency Reporter Wang Shaotong</p>
<p>The Prospect of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>When we talked about how to achieve victory in the national war of resistance, the opinions of Mr. Zhu and Mr. Peng were completely consistent. They believed that we had suffered losses in the battles on the Northwest lines, but this was only a local situation, and the final victory must belong to us. However, to win the final victory, the reasons for the past failures must be reviewed and the defense improved. This time, our country is resisting for self-defense, so strategically, it is defensive. However, because our country's weapons are far inferior to those of other countries, and our national defense equipment is extremely weak, if we adopt a purely defensive strategy, we will inevitably suffer defeat. Therefore, in terms of tactics, we must adopt active defense, that is, offensive defense. This offensive defense means being able to concentrate our superior forces to launch a fierce attack on the enemy while they are moving or before they have gained a firm foothold, so that we can annihilate the enemy. Otherwise, only knowing to defend to the death in one place is tantamount to helping the enemy exert their modern technical power. As a result, instead of defending to the death in that way, it is better to say that we are guarding ourselves to death. The past failures were because the enemy was able to use their strengths to attack our weaknesses. If we want to dare to defeat the enemy, we must avoid their strengths and attack their weaknesses. We must be able to penetrate deep into the enemy's rear and attack them at any time. At the beginning, we must engage in close combat with bayonets and fight them hand-to-hand. This is the best way to avoid the enemy's technological advantages. To be able to penetrate deep into the enemy's rear, it is best to use guerrilla tactics. Guerrilla forces can establish many small bases in the enemy's rear to weaken the enemy's forces separately. At the same time, our main force can be used for surprise attacks, instead of using a large number of troops for defense and containment, so that we are contained. In this way, the enemy will be exhausted and unable to cope. In this way, we have invisibly changed from a passive to an active position. We are very confident that victory belongs to us. However, to launch a guerrilla war, we must first mobilize the masses to engage in guerrilla warfare, and it is inseparable from the masses. Guerrilla warfare is the highest form of mass resistance. During the period of mobilizing the masses, we should quickly organize the masses and train the masses. Our people still lack education, or because they have been disturbed by the poorly disciplined troops in the past. This is really the most heartbreaking thing. Now is the time to resist the brutal enemy. If the troops disturb the people, it is really heartbreaking. We must know that no matter what kind of war, it is difficult to win without the help of the people. Mr. Zhu and Mr. Peng expressed the above opinions in extremely sincere words. We are now striving for the final victory of the war, and the opinions of the two gentlemen are really worthy of attention.</p>
<p>A Factual Examination of the Eighth Route Army</p>
<p>In addition to interviewing Mr. Zhu and Mr. Peng, the reporter also conducted a general examination of the essence of the Eighth Route Army. Everyone knows that the Eighth Route Army is the former vanguard of the Chinese "Red Army." They have gone through five major encirclements and suppressions in the past ten years and encountered countless difficulties, but they have been able to overcome all kinds of difficulties one by one. I think this should not be a coincidence. Before the reporter went to the Eighth Route Army to investigate, he also had a mysterious psychological feeling towards them, just like ordinary people, and wondered where the reason for their existence lay. After this investigation, I felt that the reason for their existence was very ordinary, very simple, and very inevitable, just like a play that has been taken apart and is not surprising. But the problem lies in the little trick of the magician. This trick can be discussed in terms of spiritual and material aspects. In terms of spirit, in addition to training, they also have an hour of lectures every day on political issues, social status, and mass psychology, so that every member has at least a superficial understanding of every issue. This can be said to be the cleverness of their leaders, because psychological understanding can produce the same will. With the same will, the spirit will be united, the steps will be consistent, and strength can be generated. This is almost a law. For example, their troops participated in the Anti-Japanese War this time. Every soldier had already understood the crimes of Japanese imperialism and all kinds of ambitions to invade China. Every soldier's mind had already stored the concept that Japan must be overthrown. Undoubtedly, their steps on the Anti-Japanese War front will be consistent, their spirit will be united, and they will definitely generate great strength. When the reporter was in the Eighth Route Army, he casually asked a fourteen or fifteen-year-old orderly, and he could tell you why he wanted to overthrow Japan and the mission of their trip to the front line. This is really worthy of admiration and attention. Secondly, they do not distinguish between classes. Whether it is the commander-in-chief or the orderly, in addition to the difference in duties, they usually entertain and chat together. It is very common for a soldier to meet the commander-in-chief. There is no sign of being too restrained, and there is no sign of the leader's unwarranted prestige. If a soldier makes a mistake, he is not punished by beating or scolding, but only by kind instructions to correct their mistakes. Imagine such a group, without spiritual restraints, only harmony and joy, how can they not generate great strength, how can they be easily destroyed, they are just growing there every day. Speaking of material aspects, it is completely equal treatment. If the commander-in-chief eats meat today, the soldiers will definitely eat meat. If the soldiers eat vegetables today, the commander-in-chief will definitely eat vegetables. The commander-in-chief's clothing is no different from the soldiers'. There is simply no exception. Although these are small things, in fact, the equality of material enjoyment has a great effect on transferring the spirit. Because the equality of material treatment can give every soldier spiritual comfort. This comfort, however, produces a result of no resentment and no injustice. There is also one point, that is, the cadres of the Eighth Route Army, they can all understand the masses and grasp the masses. They always put the masses first, no matter when and where. They do most of their work on the masses. Therefore, wherever they go, they can get the sympathy and help of the masses. This reporter passed through the villages near the Eighth Route Army this time. No matter which resident I asked, they all had a special liking for the Eighth Route Army and gave many good criticisms. I think every resident may not be lying. Although these are all characteristics of the Eighth Route Army, in fact, they are all very ordinary things and do not count as any tricks. I think any officer who leads the team can understand, and the trick is still in whether he can earnestly do it. The Eighth Route Army can do it, so it gives people a special impression. The reporter's time on the front line was too short, and what I saw of the Eighth Route Army was such a superficial concept. I firmly believe that I cannot speak very thoroughly and in detail. This can only be said to be fulfilling the reporter's responsibility to report faithfully.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway</h3>

<p>Guangzhou Communication: For a month, enemy planes have been bombing Guangzhou every day in rotation, causing great local losses. Since the 1st of this month, the enemy planes have changed their strategy and plan to bomb all parts of the province. At about 6 o'clock this morning, more than a dozen enemy planes divided into three teams came from the east. One team flew to Humen, Yuzhu and other places to spy. One team approached the northeast suburbs of Guangzhou and dropped four bombs on the Dahe River. One team flew to the Pajiangkou in the northern district for reconnaissance and was repelled by our plane team. At 1:30 p.m., three enemy planes flew to Huangpu again to bomb small ships such as Haizhou, dropping six bombs. On the morning of the 2nd, at about 8 o'clock, several enemy planes were found in the sky over Huangpu, dropping bombs. At 1:00 p.m., four enemy bombers flew over Humen again, and were attacked by our air force and land anti-aircraft guns. They could not succeed, and turned to the Huangpu Yuzhu area, dropping seven bombs to bomb the small ships on the river. The bombs fell into the water, and one bomb fell on a village near Huangpu, destroying more than a dozen houses and killing and injuring dozens of people. At 3:10 p.m., two enemy planes flew to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to spy on the Shitan Bridge and were repelled by us. They did not dare to enter the urban area and fled. At 11:00 a.m. on the 3rd, seven enemy planes took off from the Tangjiawan sea area, passed Zhongshan, passed the southeast of Guangzhou, and arrived at Humen Huangpu. At about 11:00, they dropped eight or nine bombs on the Guangdong ships in Huangpu. Seven bombs sank into the water, and one bomb hit Tanzhou Village near Huangpu, killing more than a dozen innocent refugees. On the same day, the enemy transferred more than 30 enemy ships from Shanghai to the south, gathering in the Lingdingyang area to the outside of the Humen Fortress, including large and small patrol ships, destroyers, submarines, etc. Later, it was detected that our defense of Humen was solid, and to prevent our air force from bombing, six enemy ships sailed to Taishan Guanghai and Anmen and other places to anchor on the 4th. Another seven or eight ships sailed to Tangjiawan and occupied the three small islands opposite Zhongshan Port, sending sailors to land, planning to build an airfield on the island. The enemy planes on the aircraft carriers did not take off all day on the 4th. On the 5th, there was a hurricane, and the enemy planes did not dare to take off again. Therefore, the citizens of Guangzhou have enjoyed 48 hours of peace and quiet for more than 40 days. However, the enemy still took this opportunity to send more fleets and air forces south, plotting to invade Guangdong on a large scale again, planning to bomb the rails and bridges of the southern section of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway to cut off our north-south transportation and the national outlet to the sea, while using superior naval and air forces to disrupt the coastal areas of Guangdong Province, plotting to land, in order to contain our rear base of operations. The plan is very vicious. On the 6th, enemy planes flew from the two aircraft carriers in Tangjiawan and Yamen again, and launched a large-scale bombing. It is estimated that at about 7:00 a.m., six enemy planes passed Jiangmen, and at about 8:00 passed Guangzhou, and then turned to the Huangpu Xinzhou area to drop bombs. Eight bombs fell near Xiaogang in Huangpu, and twelve bombs fell near Xinzhou. The old torpedo bureau in the area has been destroyed, and more than 20 shops in Xinzhou Market were bombed and collapsed by enemy bombs, killing more than 30 villagers and injuring more than 120 people. On the same day, 30 or 40 wounded were sent to Guangzhou and admitted to various hospitals for treatment. At the same time, enemy planes flew to Xinzao Township in Panyu County and Xintang Township in Zengcheng County and dropped two bombs each. They did not retreat until about 9:00 a.m. Before long, more than 30 enemy planes took off from Tangjiawan and Yamen, met in Jiangmen, and passed through Sihui to the Pajiangkou in the North River. Fifteen planes bombed a factory in Pajiang, five planes bombed Qujiang (i.e., Shaoguan), and ten planes wantonly bombed stations along the southern section of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway. All tracks in Jiangcun, Shijing, Xiaoping, Yuantan, Dalang, Pajiang stations were destroyed in some places, and power lines along the road were also destroyed. Our air force in the northern district immediately dispatched a plane team to go south from Lechang to meet the attack. A fierce air battle broke out above Pajiang for a while, which was rare since the brutal enemy invaded Guangdong. The enemy planes relied on their superior strength and used twelve planes to resist our planes stubbornly, and more than ten planes specialized in bombing. After four hours of confrontation, the enemy dropped more than 60 bombs in Pajiang, and several villages near the station were completely burned down, and 200 to 300 villagers were killed and injured. Dozens of shops in Pajiang Market were burned down, and the villagers who were bombed had their limbs mutilated, and the situation was very tragic. Dozens of houses were also destroyed at Xiaoping Station. Thirty to forty civilian houses were destroyed in Shaoguan, and more than 20 bombs fell, killing and injuring more than 100 residents. In addition, the tracks of Dalang Station, Xiaoping Station, and Pajiang Station were all bombed. The Southern Station Office of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway immediately dispatched an engineering vehicle to repair it (October 7).</p>
<h3>Dismembered Corpse Found in a Trunk on the North Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Detective No. 357 of the Huishi Concession Police Department and several Chinese detectives were patrolling within the boundary at 8:45 p.m. on the 16th of the month (the time has been confirmed). When they checked between North Suzhou Road, North Fujian Road, and North Zhejiang Road, they saw a wooden trunk that was unattended. When they opened it, there was a dismembered male corpse inside, about 36 years old, with axe wounds on the head, ears, and fingers. It seemed that he had been murdered and put in a trunk and abandoned. So they sent it to the coroner's office. This morning, they reported to the Special First Court and asked an official to inspect it, then ordered it to be buried. At the same time, the police department will conduct a strict investigation to find out the truth.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow Association Will Send the Last Batch of Refugees Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Reception Center Set Up in Ningbo, Reception Center in Shanghai Closed</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai established a rescue team to handle reception and repatriation matters since the outbreak of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War. The last batch of refugees will be sent off tomorrow. The Datong News Agency reporter now divides and records the details as follows:</p>
<p>Reception and Repatriation Process</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Shanghai War, the Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai has been very active in handling the repatriation and reception of fellow refugees. It has set up 14 reception centers and repatriated 150,000 refugees. Up to now, there is only one reception center left (Cile Lane, Nanjing Road), accommodating 1,138 refugees.</p>
<p>Location Determined in Ningbo</p>
<p>Because these refugees are all homeless, the association made special plans before repatriation to ensure that they would not be displaced in their hometowns when they returned to their hometowns. A few days ago, it sent an executive, Dong Xinqin, to Ningbo to find a suitable location in Ningbo and rush to set up a reception center. Today, the association received a telegram from Mr. Dong, stating that the location of the reception center has been determined.</p>
<p>Last Batch to be Received in Ningbo</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the association decided to send the refugees received in Cile Lane to Ningbo by the Ende Wheel tomorrow for reception, and close the reception center in Shanghai. The association's letter to the Public Works Department is recorded below: Sir, our association has now found an address in Ningbo and set up a reception center to repatriate all the fellow villagers who are suffering in Shanghai to the inland for reception. It is scheduled to handle the repatriation on the 19th of this month. We are deeply afraid that some refugees will not obey the advice. We plan to ask your department to send the police to protect them in order to facilitate the process. This letter is to inform you, and we also ask our association member, Mr. Liang Zhuoren, to contact you. We hope you will investigate.</p>
<h3>Compilation of News of Comfort</h3>
<p>New Pharmaceutical Industry</p>
<p>The New Pharmaceutical Industry Association of this city held a meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of comforting the soldiers in the North China War Zone. Representatives from Zhongxi, Zhongfa, Jihuatang, Huamei, Wuzhou, Yongan Tang, Xinya, Qianhua, Zhongying, Huayang, Jicheng, Corden, Taihe, Xinxing, Nanyang, Zhengde, Zhengwei, Huaying, Dahua, Dazhong, Dalu, Xinhua, Taipingyang, and Gongda attended and agreed to donate 5,000 yuan as consolation money.</p>
<p>Relief Association</p>
<p>The Wartime Donation Coordination Association, in view of the fact that the slightly wounded soldiers in this city will be moved to other cities for recuperation as much as possible, and cotton-padded clothes are in great demand when they are discharged from the hospital, has raised a large number of cotton vests, padded jackets and pants, and running shoes and socks, which are delivered daily. The work is very busy.</p>
<p>Clothing Factory</p>
<p>The voluntary clothing factory at 207 Jing'an Temple Road makes cotton vests for soldiers, charging only eight cents for labor and sixty-five cents for materials. The labor cost for each set of cotton-padded jackets and pants for wounded soldiers and refugees is only 20 cents. How do philanthropists donate? (You can contact 22737).</p>
<p>Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition</p>
<p>The calligraphy and painting consolation meeting hosted by the Chinese Painting Association and the Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association has received many works from Zhang Renjie, Bai Wenwei, Liu Yazi, Wang Yiting, He Xiangning, Xu Beihong, Lou Xinhu, Zhang Yuguang, and others for many days. In addition, Ms. Li Qiujun wrote a painting of palace ladies with hairpins, entitled "Han Yi Xing," with a resounding tone and can be called the three masterpieces.</p>
<p>Shenyi Association</p>
<p>The Shenyi Association of this port, taking a certain division as our country's elite troops, participated in the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War and annihilated the Japanese pirates, repeatedly making meritorious deeds, and especially caring for the refugees on the front line. The members of the association, Pan Zhiquan, etc., specially prepared a war horse and a telescope, and dedicated them to the commander of the division to express their respect. It is said that they have sent people to the front.</p>
<h3>Domestic Stocks in Japan Plummet Due to Militarism</h3>
<p>Market Prices Fell to 40% or 30% Before the War Against China</p>
<p>Financial news: The industrial and commercial circles in Japan are quite fearful and uneasy about the gradual implementation of various cases such as the increase of taxes on various goods and the implementation of capital adjustment. They have also been hit hard by the failure of the Shanghai War, resulting in a sharp decline in the prices of various stocks in the country. For example, the market prices of stocks such as Zhongfang, Di Ren, and Yuee Fishery have been declining. As of recently, the prices of most stocks have fallen to 40% before the war of aggression against China, and the prices of some stocks have fallen to more than 30%, which is a rare phenomenon in recent years. This is truly the retribution of the militarists.</p>
<h3>The War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenyong</p>
<p>The battle started on August 13th, and enemy ships came on the Wusong River. The planes and heavy artillery carried by the ships wanted to turn the prosperous city into ashes. The landing team on Baoshan Road first launched a riot and caused disaster. Our army bravely shouted to kill the thieves, and the light of knives and shadows of bullets moved the wind and thunder. The enemies were so frightened that their hands trembled and they couldn't hold their machine guns. In the first battle, thousands of enemies were killed, and in the second battle, they thirsted for the blood of the enemy. In the third battle, they captured tanks, and in the fourth battle, they almost destroyed the fleet. In the fifth battle, they saw enemy planes falling. Although the iron birds fell from the sky, in the sixth battle, they controlled the Eight Character Bridge, and our army was truly heroic. In the seventh battle, they wiped out the enemy in Yangshupu, and the enemy's tactics were despicable. In the eighth battle, they defeated the enemy in the Lion Forest, and the roar of the sleeping lion suffocated the enemy. In the ninth battle, they conquered Luodian Town, and the encirclement strategy was called amazing. In the tenth battle, they broke the enemy in the Yunzaobang, and the enemy was subdued like fish and turtles. Our army is so heroic and proud that the revitalization of the nation is today. The soldiers are firm and decisive in combat, and the generals are meritorious but not arrogant. The enemy is violent, but we show kindness. The enemy is bloodthirsty, but we use benevolence. Thousands of prisoners have been captured by us, and they are treated well to protect their lives. How can the enemy planes indiscriminately bomb, causing disaster to innocent people? Poisonous bombs and gas are all banned, and the world has sympathy for them. Although it is not too deceptive to use troops, no cruelty can succeed. How can our country have no flying generals? Why not destroy Tokyo to kill the enemy and protect the country is my ambition, and violence is what I despise. I only hope that the war of resistance can be sustained, and I swear not to be militaristic and exhaust the soldiers. The great country of Yan Huang's descendants should be ashamed of the small country that is easy to be proud of. Victory is not to be happy, and defeat is not to be sad. The leader's words are sincere and firm, arousing the strange men of China, and asking for the war in the sound of National Day. Don't you see the great general Yue Wu of the Southern Song Dynasty, who was furious and protected the nation? Don't you see Wu Xianghou, the prime minister of the Later Han Dynasty, who commanded with determination and showed his ingenuity? Don't you see the national hero Mr. Jiang, who leads the country as a defense line, saves China with peace and struggle, and sweeps away the demons to save the world?</p>
