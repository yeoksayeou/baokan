<h3>英國與法西斯國家（二）</h3>
<p>— 英議員Strabolgi　金圖南譯</p>
<p>從前，英國有了一個强固的艦隊了，環繞它的海岸的海面，即使像英法之间二十二英里廣闊的海道，就已具備充分的防衛力，現在因為欧陸空軍效力與空軍數量的迅速增加，它的全部地位已改觀了。同時，英國也知道在太平洋方面還受到日本的威脅，因為日本所進行的既定方針是將趨向在英國保護之下的馬萊聯邦而達到印度的門戶，這在戰略上是很重要的。</p>
<p>但是，英國的統治階級，社會領袖金融界和一般上流人物，所最怕的還是共產主義。在這般人的心目中，以為法國和西班牙的現政府是和蘇聯的共產黨相同的。</p>
<p>英國的一般貴族和銀行界，唯恐共產主義的威脅，泰半都竭力親德，此外也有別種勢力在響動，而大體說來，在英國的德國勢力是正在繼長增高。</p>
<p>這種壓力及其反響，使英國內閣為了今日最關重要的政策問題發生裂痕。一部份相當於首相之下的幹部閣員欲和德國和好以購取和平：另一部份的閣員却以為這是無論如何不能使德國滿足的。這一部份人依然信仰英國四百年來維持歐洲均勢的傳統政策，這個政策就是時常去支撐團結反抗任何强國成為霸主，而在今日所謂“均勞”之意義就是表明增强國聯與國聯合作。</p>
<p>這一部份人，我們為便利起見，可以稱之謂親法派，是代表英國擁護國聯選民的大多數。當兩派發生爭執起來，有時甲派的意向伸展，有時乙派的意向伸展。</p>
<p>迨德國的軍隊重行佔領萊因非武裝區域的時候，破壞洛加諾條約問題使英法兩國的外交部之間緊張起來。</p>
<p>英國主張予以寬恕，法國主張問罪並强迫德國撤兵。英國內閣或政府的任何一部份，都知道德國的毀約問題；但是早有人以英國或有的反饗通知希特勒及其顧問。這通知是準確的，英國的輿論關於這件事情都傾向於德國。這是今年三月裏的事情。</p>
<p>在去年的秋季，英國輿論支持袒護國聯和親法的集團，致推翻了瓜分阿比西尼亞的霍爾拉伐爾協定。這個集團在英國的內閣中，於是就阻止了贊成恢復德國以前殖民地的任何公開宣言：不過這並不是說，內閣主要幹部的有力集團，和德國同性質的集團沒有一種秘密的諒解。</p>
<p>這裏有一些證據可以證明。</p>
<p>從若干擁有權威的報紙，像代表外交部意見的著名的倫敦泰晤士報，可以看出一種微妙的變化。這許多輿論機關漸漸地反蘇聯而親德了。它們盡力放膽支持柏林金融獨裁者沙赫特的地位。有一些德國軍火製造的原料是用英國金錢購辦的。</p>
<p>去年英國的海軍部—它在英國政制中是向來最有權力的一部而且是時常採乃它自己所有的外交政策的—隱瞞過了美法兩國政府，簽訂英德海軍協定。這件事情實際就是孟寒附所造成功的。他是當時的海相而且是首相鮑爾溫的親信之一。但現在雖然已經退職，但是這種政策的趨勢尚還保留着。</p>
<p>在去年夏季為了土耳其海峽問題而舉行的蒙特婁會議，英國代表單獨力爭在發生戰事之際，敵國艦隊有通過海峽以達黑海的權利。這是特別有利於德國的，縱然德國並未參加談判。英國這種主張，法國和蘇聯土耳其羅馬尼亞這三個黑海的濱海之國一致反對。照英國的這種態度說來，簡直把國聯不放在它的眼裏，而最後英國代表不得不讓步了；可是不久明白地宣露出來這件事情是為德國的利益而發動的。</p>
<p>在國聯企圖以制裁方法壓制意國使與阿比西尼亞保持和平的複雜過程中，法國在拉伐爾內閣當權之下的右派政府，因欲通過洛加諾條約與意國合作以牽制德國，不願與意國决裂：然而英國的政策則恰巧與之相反。英國朝野實不欲過分使墨索利尼和羅馬的法西斯政府的地位衰弱，因為他們唯恐意國的左派得勢（這個左派在他們的心目中就是共產黨）。這種見解在當時也便是德國政府和外交部的主要成見。英國不欲對意施行眞正制裁的這個政策—因制裁將使之損害—是為柏林所歡迎的。</p>
<p>但從遠處着想，東菲建立了法西斯帝國，殊非英國之利。這不但威脅英國的殖民地，並且威脅英車經過紅海到印度的海道。這一層影響及於英國的威信。總之英國態度的躊躇不决，其後面尚有外鑠的動機，尤其是在準備施用對意煤油制裁之際和受中立法案限制下的美國合作大部份可以確定之際的這個時候。</p>
<p>這個外鑠的動機就是英國政府在內閣以內一部份的秘密協定，藉以迎合德國於半途而表示與希特勒和好，其所得代價的一部即欲寬縱德國對付東歐的蘇聯，而德國所欲得的代價則比較這層還要高一些，包括染指於但澤自由市，英國，和捷克等國。至於法國的政策與觀念呢，即使德國能夠得到其代價之半，是也要加以直接的反對的。</p>
<p>這種把戲就是美法破裂的準備，縱令英德交易的條欵中並不包括法國與荷蘭比國在內。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>中日外交的動向</h3>
<p>— 起</p>
<p>自從去年年底成都北海兩案解决以後。中日雙方又有進行外交談判的趨勢。日大使川越五日對朝日新聞駐南京記者發表談話。稱中日談判或能於短期間內賡續舉行。同時華北當局與日方亦有進行解决懸案的傳聞。吾們希望這些消息背後沒有什麼其他文章。而只表示日方對於解决中日問題的正確觀念的樹立。</p>
<p>就解决成都北海兩案所發表的中日雙方換文看。吾們不能不承認這是肅清中日兩國間陰鬱空氣的可喜的開端。撇開內容不論。這些換文的成立終究徵示日本外來的一個正確觀念的轉向。那就是承認成都北海這一類的案件是尋常的個別的地方案件。不從此引出什麼含混的轉滋糾紛的結論。例如先前曾經有一些日人把成都北海事件解釋為我國整個排日運動的表示等就是如共日方眞能根據這樣現實主義的外交觀念來調整中日兩國間的關係。吾們相信雙方外交談判的前途。一定可以回復到清明的氣象。</p>
<p>鑒於最近外交發展的情勢。吾們以為吾們中國人應該有一種新的覺醒。如其說最近的中日外交。增强了漸趨穩定的可能性。吾們應該看出這樣的變遷乃是吾們國家統一團結的反映。譬如。即以成都北海兩案的解决來講。假使客歲的西安事件拖延不得迅速的解决甚至內部發生了很大的不幸的罅隙。也許這兩案的談判到現在還沒有頭緒。即使解决了。恐怕也難免與現在的𢌿其內容最近川越發表的談話中。也曾說。“西安事變。為時輩僅兩週但適值最危急之時中國國民政府之善後辦法及其人民對政府之信賴均極堪注意此為中國大進步之明證”（見昨日本報）外交家底辭令。雖然未可全盤置信為眞。而這樣書論的發表。究竟也有事實的根據。這種事實。會變更外交對手的信念態度。因而形成外交談判發展的新的轉向。由此可知。吾們只有上下團結一致。集中力量。才能夠獲得外交順利的解决。</p>
<p>吾們相信。清除中日兩國間的低氣壓。不單是我們中國人底願望。恐怕也是日本人士所非常關心的一件事。中日兩國的關係不澈底改善。東亞和平。儘管說得怎樣嘴響。恐怕只是泡影空花東亞和平如不能成功一定會影響及世界的和平前途為着整個人類的和平前途計為着東亞和平計。吾們敢把上面所提出的兩點意思敬陳於中日兩國人士之前。</p>
<h3>日本調整對俄關係</h3>
<p>解决邊境問題　雙方意見懸隔</p>
<p>［東京］日俄兩國之間現存主要縣案、為新漁業條約之訂立與邊境設立委員會問題、有田外相為早時解决此事懸案起見、决定於日內邀請俄駐日大使至外務省、督促進行交涉、滿俄邊境問題、日俄兩方意見大體一致、唯餘㊀國境處理委員會之組織、㊁國境確定以前應認從來國境為正當國境、㊂紛舉處理委員會應管理全部國境事件等三項問題、兩方意見未見接近、（七日同盟電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福向國會宣布大政方針</h3>
<p>依據憲法推行新政　禁止軍火運西班牙　選衆兩院迅速通過</p>
<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福總統今日向國會宣讀週年咨文、以“第二期新政”之目的、昭告人民、衆院會塲中聽衆擁擠、總統以清朗之聲調、謂無須修改憲法、即可使全國復興法為合法、（此點非常重要、因有人早已預料、此次大選、政府既得大多數人民之信任、自將重提全國復興法、而戰勝一切憲法問題、）總統並謂、環境使彼不得不提出下列要求、</p>
<p>㊀延長前屆國會所賦予而即將滿期之權限、</p>
<p>㊁進一步推行中立法、以應付西班牙內戰所引起之局勢、</p>
<p>㊂追加本年度預算、</p>
<p>美國歷任總統、向以書面咨文、致送國會、羅斯福上次即親自宣讀、此次仍依照前例、聽衆除參衆兩院議員外、旁聽席上滿坐閣員•外賓•名流•平民、最可注意者為最高法院諸法官、無一到者、故未聆得總統對於彼等解釋憲法之率直的批評、</p>
<p>總統謂“美國民主政治之運用、决不可因拒絕自由政府必要之權力而受危險、故司法方面亦須為民主政治之成功而努力、現在行政與立法雙方、已能密切合作、吾人雖不求法院產生向不存在之權力、然在憲法範圍以內之權力、固應使其盡量生效、以增進大衆之福利也、”</p>
<p>總統復稱、彼深信全國復興法之目標、實頗穩妥、惟未免食多不化之嫌、現在法律雖已失效、惟當前之問題尚未解决、</p>
<p>總統並主張聯邦法律、應補各州法律之不足、以謀解决近代發明所用起之超越州界的社會及經濟問題、至於憲法問題、則總統以為一年以來、人民已多明瞭、憲法並無錯誤之處、故目前之急需、並非修改憲法、而為清明之解釋、倘能解釋正當、則儘可為進步之利器、而不為任何行動之障礙、</p>
<p>總統反對毫無限制之過量生產、及專利把持之抑低生產、蓋國家之利益、全特政府扶助私人實業、維持穩妥之物價、而不使其有猛烈之升降云、</p>
<p>最後總統論及外交問題、謂寡頭政治之國家中、黷武主義已氣燄萬丈云、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福總統咨文讀畢、參衆兩院即於昨夜以絕大多數、通過禁止軍械子彈軍用品輸往西班牙或轉運至西班牙案、此案稍經討論、即予通過、其迅速為前所未有、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>西班牙戰爭殘暴美中立法修正</h3>
<p>星期五可簽署生效　軍火一批趕速運出</p>
<p>［華盛頓］參議院與衆議院頃於本日投票、通過議院外交委員會主席畢德門所提現行中立法修正案、規定各種軍用品、一概禁止運往西班牙、凡最近所發軍火輸往西班牙出口准許證、亦將因此注銷、</p>
<p>該案內稱“西班牙革命實係一種罕有之殘暴戰爭、且其戰過足以蔓延至西班牙國境之外、職是之故、美國軍用品輸往西班牙之舉、對於美國本身之安全與和平、殊多危險、與美國政府之中立政策、亦屬背道而馳、就此種局勢、實有立即通過法案之必要、”</p>
<p>該案並規定、“凡一切軍械子彈及軍用品、一律禁止自美國或美國屬地運往西班牙、其運往他國、以便轉運西班牙內戰當事雙方者、亦在禁止之列、違犯此項禁令者處以一萬美元之罰金、或處徒刑五年、”</p>
<p>至法案內規定禁運之軍用品、與去年四月十日意阿兩國戰爭時、羅斯福總統禁運軍火宣言內所規定之名目相同、各項非軍用飛機及其拆卸機件、亦在禁運之列、有效時期則由羅斯福總統裁奪、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］參衆兩院甫於本日開會、參院外交委員會主席畢德門所提禁止軍火還往西班牙國案、即未經反對、而順利通過、羅斯福總統因而獲一絕大勝利、但當時曾有講員若干人聲明、謂投票贊成、乃因國際現行情勢嚴重、不得不在立法上採取緊念程序所致、若謂保障美國中立之道、不外禁止軍。出口一項辦法、則非所贊同、似此、國會在本月核討論新中立法案時、若料其亦能順從政府意旨、一如本日所為、則恐未必盡然、惟各方面對於羅斯福總統之咨文、無不加以好評、某某方面雖以為總統演說詞定必較為切實、但各觀察家則謂、總統并不高談闊論、益足見其下腕敏活、緣總統在本屆國會中、雖擁有空前之多數、但關於國家大計、仍不欲逸出職權范圍、寗願聽任參衆兩院自行提出議案、因而總統在咨文中、僅向國會提議兩事、㊀禁止軍火運往西班牙國决議案、應請予以通過、㊁關於整理金融救濟失業經費問題、政府現所享有之某種特權、應請國會予以延長、俾竟全功、此外消息變通人士并宣稱、總統尚在內政上擬定若干項辦法、以備提付國會討論云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［柏林］政府今日决定、在答復英法中立建議之前、停止續派志願兵赴西班牙、德國東南部駐軍今日無一應徵者、官方對此表示滿意、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>［柏林］關於英法兩國提議禁止志願兵前往西班牙國一事、負責人士頃宣稱、德國政府復文、仍當於本日送出、其內容聞係重申該國見解、在根本上當與意大利無甚出入、此項復文、究在柏林送達英法兩國大使、抑都德國駐英法兩國大使分送駐在國政府、尚無所聞、其大要常不外下開三項、㊀德國政府主張下午涉問題、務常通盤予以解决、質言之、各種間接干涉辦法、尤其是金錢接濟、務當與派遣志願兵一事、同時予以禁止、㊁西班牙境內現有之外籍政治人員、務當予以撤退、此層顯係指蘇聯人員而言、則以各該人員、聞在西班牙政府中。居於重要地位故也、㊂此項複文、并當說明德意兩國所眞見解、完全一致云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］各國左派人士合組之義勇隊共約二千人、今日下午一時在波比南地方越過邊境、乘車開往西班牙巴塞洛那、其中以波蘭人為最多、另有救護隊一隊、中有美國人一名、蘇俄高射砲四十架同時運往比爾波、法政府發言人今日告美聯社記者、謂法國對於西班牙準備參加海陸空封鎖計劃、以阻止糧及醫藥物品外之任何貨物運往西班牙、但須得意德俄三國合作云、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］法國駐德大使龐賽、原定於星期五日返國、面謁外長台爾博斯、茲悉已將行期展緩、此間若干報紙以為、龐賽或當與德國當局進行重要談話、故不即離任、午報載稱、“德國當局以為、德法兩國直接進行談判、俾克澄清時局、此其時矣”云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>鹽務稽核總所發展皖岸鹽務</h3>
<p>中央社云、財政部鹽務稽核總所、年來對於各地鹽政之改革、鹽稅之整頓、頗見成效、昨據該所發表皖岸鹽務整理情形、茲摘要録後、以為關心者告、皖岸為淮鹽四大銷岸（鄂•湘•西•皖•）之一、年征鹽稅六百萬元以上、其區域范圍、係就安徽省境中、除去皖北十九縣歸山駐蚌埠收稅處管理征稅、與及天長縣同隸於兩淮鹽區外、所餘之皖北合肥等七縣、及皖南全部、在此司理鹽務行政事務之機關為榷運局、司理稽核徵稅秤放等事務者為皖岸稽核處、近年財政當局亟思統一事權、提高辦事效率、故令由稽核處經理兼理榷運局事務、年來興利除弊、裕課便民、均已頗見成績、</p>
<p>蕪湖籌設中央總倉</p>
<p>皖岸各地鹽斤、向由淮區十二圩帆運分撥、於到達後、繳稅開售、近為集中、管理便利分配、並作施行新鹽法之準備起見、業在蕪湖江岸購置地基、籌設中央總倉、計劃於此項總倉建成以後、所有運岸鹽斤、一律先行集中堆放、然後按各分岸需要情形、及酌量運輸方法途徑、分途推銷、如此、在商人方面，既得安藏保險、無慮損失、在公家方面、更可防制漏私、增益官銷、現在此項倉房計劃已定、不日即可開始修建、</p>
<p>安慶創設淮鹽分棧</p>
<p>皖岸上游懷寗（安慶）太湖等七縣、其食鹽向係由大通供給、人民遠道採購、不特運費增加、且須負担交通鹽行之每担五分手續費、殊失公平便利、稽核處因特呈准於安慶創設淮鹽分棧、督飭鹽商、自產區直接運鹽存儲、售鹽牌價、則比照大通一樣、近聞該分棧年可銷鹽百票之譜、</p>
<p>改善運輸减低運費</p>
<p>皖岸運鹽　向係帆運、其轉運各分岸者、因內河水位較淺、必須改易小船駁運、輾運遞駁、費鉅運艱、甚系脫銷、商人以駁費轉嫁鹽價、更加民負、近年當局有鹽及此督飭各商、儘量利用近代運輸工具、現如宜城·青陽•石棣•太平•等縣用鹽、均由公路汽車運送、由江岸運往合肥鹽斤、則改行淮南鐵路車運、不但减少危險、抑且省費省時、</p>
<p>减輕稅率防止私銷</p>
<p>皖岸淮鹽稅率、除毘連江西之一部分銷區外、均較鄰省為高、鄰鹽侵銷、事所恒有、故如太湖•和縣•當塗•石棣•太平•旌德•等縣鹽稅、近已將稅率每担核减一元、俾與昆連各地大致相仿、一面並酌調稅警、以事防杜、樣本兼施、頗著成效、即如太湖一縣、前數年內遭輕稅塲侵奪、幾無銷市、近則可月銷千餘担•太平•石棣•兩縣、减稅緝防之餘、更行改進運輸、因以成本减轻、逐增销数、</p>
<p>取缔船户提高盐质</p>
<p>皖岸食鹽鹽質頗壞、其故乃在所有鹽斤、均自十二圩運岸、該處存鹽質色均次、加以帆運遲緩、船戶沿途灑賣、多以攙雜灌滷、補其缺額、故鹽斤一經抵岸滷耗既奇重、鹽質乃益劣、近當局督責西梁關食鹽覆查所、於鹽船過關時、先行提取鹽樣化騐、凡不合標準成分者、即不予簽證放行、一方面由各秤放處注意、如查有污濁鹽斤、勒令消毀、灌滷濕鹽、飭令濾滷曬乾後、方准過秤收倉、套色尤不准加用、以免减少鹽斤凈重迭經嚴厲整頓、上述諸弊、乃漸見减除、鹽質亦遂以提高云、</p>

<p>大公社云、滬西周家橋申新紡織公司八廠搖紗部工人六百餘名、於昨晨六時起、發生怠工風潮、經黨政機關派員勸導並施調處後、旋卽告解决、工方於中午復工、詎夜班上工後、又起糾紛、搖紗及細紗兩部、仍完全怠工、該管警局、派員彈壓、工潮恐將擴大、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>工潮起因</p>
<p>申新紡織公司一八兩廠曁布廠、同設於滬西周家橋範圍頗大、雇有男女工人六千餘名、最近工方因發覺廠方有短給工資情事、認為故意尅扣、曾要求廠方按日在工摺上註明每日工資數額、（按該廠工資論件計算）以資核對、而免錯誤、乃廠方對是項要求、迄未實行、致引起工方不滿、醞釀工潮、</p>
<p>昨晨怠工</p>

<h3>易君左等二十餘人發起江蘇文藝作家恊進會</h3>
<p>並發表中國民族文藝運動宣言</p>
<p>易君左等二十餘人、發起“江蘇文藝作家協進會”並發出中國民族文藝運動宣言云、全國同胞、全國文藝作家、及一切愛好文藝者、</p>
<p>我們要認清當前的時代、當前的中國、當前的時代、是一個國際帝國主義猖獗的時代、他們始終不鬆懈他們侵略的野心、處心積慮來壓迫我們、蹂躪我們、當前的中國、已到了生死存亡的最後關鍵、我們的內部、還有一種出賣祖國靈魂的漢奸、和殺人不貶眼的赤匪、這兩種民族的敗類、時時企圖破壞我國的國粗顚覆我們的民族、處在這樣一個非常時期的中國、除了自力更生、外力全不可靠、自己最大的任務、就是要發揚我們固有的民族的偉大精神、細言之、就是怎樣禦侮、怎樣圖存、要禦侮圖存、就是怎樣肅清漢奸、怎樣消滅殘匪、以期踏上自力更生的大道、使我們的民族復興、</p>
<p>文藝是應該以思想為基幹的、必須把握了當前時代的任務、更不能忘却自己民族的意議、所以“民族文藝”的建立、已成了現階段文學上必然的傾向、</p>
<p>我們痛心着一般所謂“普羅作家”假偕“人民陣綫”“國防文學”等等的美名、向一切純潔無理的青年作思想上的毒蝕、我們更反對共黨和一切反動派假借這“人民陣綫”“國防文學”兩種美名的無恥行為、</p>
<p>“民族文藝”的最大涵義、便是如何建立我們偉大的“民族陣綫”如何確定我們在文學上的“民族”竟識、如何擴張我們的反帝、反共、及封建的力量、舉凡激發民族創造精神的、獎勵表現科學精神的、培養生產建設的、閦發民族固有美德的、指導民衆正當途徑的都是“民族文藝”的應有姿態、</p>
<p>我們所需要的“民族文藝”、也就是適合當前時代與中國民族性的“文藝”、反過來說、我們所不需要的文藝所應摒斥的文藝、也有下列六端、㊀我們應該消滅危害民族的普羅文藝、㊁我們應該掃除傷感主義的頹廢文藝、㊂我們應該糾正個人主義的浪漫文藝、㊃我們應該廓清腐敗觀念的封建文藝、㊄我們應該滌蕩諂諛阿媚的奴隸文藝、㊅我們應該反對有聞階級的幽默文藝、</p>
<p>我們誓貨畢生精力努力於中國民族文藝建設運動、我們既有了偉大神聖的文藝目標、願團結全國的文藝作家向這一個目標邁進、為積極建設中國民族文藝起見、我們擬有四種初步的計劃、</p>
<p>一理論的建樹、就是建立“民族文藝”的理論、使他們俱全、充實、而有力量、</p>
<p>二創作的鼓勵、就是獎勵“民族文藝”的創作、使抓住現時代民族的核心、而能深刻的表現、</p>
<p>三介紹的注重、就是對於世界各國的“民族文藝”加以介紹和閘揚、以供我們自己的參考與比較、為復興民族的借鏡、</p>
<p>四史績的宣揚、就是把我國固有的關於“民族文藝”的史料及珍貴的文藝資料蒐集整埋、加以宣揚、以堅决民族自信力、</p>
<p>為鞏固“民族文藝”壁壘、整肅“民族文藝”陣容、劃一“民族文藝”陣綫、現在我們在江蘇省會的鎮江、發起“江蘇文藝作家協進會”、期待着全國的同胞予以策進和指教、更深切的希望着全國文藝作家、一致起來、推進這偉大的中國文藝建設運動、謹此宣言、易君左•王慈•張欣餘•邢頌文•史遷•宛霄峰•徐若萍•阮貽孫•黃學儀•吳丁諦•吳伯芳•李翼仙•應蟄圜•周滌歛•胡雲翼•傳曉東•王悟民•左幹臣•葛賢寗•黃立人•黃强•周化鵬•</p>

<p>紗市轉漲、蓋以大版三品紗市暴騰九元至十二元外、市塲人必震楹、買風稍起、但一般同業、因各廠現紗根子、日見寬鬆、並有積存之望、躉囤之勇氣漸衰、故漲力有限、實則粗紗籌碼充足、故有不能隨三品而飛騰也、午後又傅英廠開出二十支五福牧羊有七•八千包、此項消息早誌本報據云價格甚廉、詳細情形、嚴守秘密</p>

<h3>悔過書</h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>這一位難友，還只有同櫳子的十多天，我就感覺到，有着許多與衆不同的地方：頭一件是樣子特別；別的許多難友，要隔五六十天剃一回頭，都是頭髪黑剌剌，鬍鬚也黑剌剌的，他卻頭皮光油油，臉孔也光油油，連一撮毛的犯人髪，都只有短短的一點點；更其是，他的兩條臂膊很粗壯，臉孔上面却見不到一點肉，助骨條條可數，很不相稱。</p>
<p>其次因為做着種花工犯，當時天氣還熱，早早夜夜要澆水，每天他都比別人出櫳子去得早，往往監房裏還沒有開始運動，看守已經拿着提僉來呌　；晚上却比別人回來得遲，總要天色已經灰暗，他才捧着滿臉盆的開水，搖搖擺擺，得着了寶貝似的，慌忙的跨進攏門來；——櫳子裏時常有人呌口乾，為着潤潤他們的喉嚨，不怕燙壞身子，也不怕聽辦事人的罵聲，他大天拿得開水回來，大家都很感激的。</p>
<p>雖然上工去得早，每天起身以後，他都要麻煩我些時候；如果相信命運，眞是命該如此的，晚上我們同一塊櫳板睡覺，天一亮就並排坐着讀書。不過他的讀書，還是查考字典的時候多；一經查到了生字，總就擎過書本來問我，“老許！這個字是什麼意思嚇？”</p>
<p>因為，他所讀的是英文，考查的是英漢字典，雖然依照英文字母，他翻得到要查的生字，却認不得註着的漢文；——他是沒和讀過一本中國書的。據說他早已死完父母，從小就由娘舅送到輪船上，一直在機器間裏混過來，天天要用勁鑿煤，所以臂膊練得很粗壯。在外國人的船上登久了，只覺得懂點英文可以占便宜，所以，不管要到什麼時候才可以出牢門，也不管出了牢門以後能不能再到輪船上面去，一有空就咿咿唔唔的讀起英文來；自然程度是低淺的。——這是他的第一個特點。</p>
<p>第四個特點是在晚上，電燈的光亮不勾看書，他總呆呆的坐着，一聲不嚮，老是皺着眉頭。過了許多日子他才告訴我，這種時候是在計劃，將來怎麼樣寫他的悔過書；雖然當時，覊押的日子改算刑期，還要兩天抵一天，他是判决確定得不多時候的，到坐過一分之一的刑期，可以寫悔過書解反省院的時候還遠得很。</p>
<p>“悔過書怎麼寫寫？”</p>
<p>告訴了我他老是想不通的情形以後，他就屢次這樣問我，也屢次問和他託熱的難友，往往在三五分鐘的談話中，接連問起好幾遍。</p>
<p>在牢監裏，於無形中，平來有着這樣的信條，就是，要用力氣，搬動笨重東西的時候，農工分子上前去；動紙墨，寫信，做報告條子或者寫悔過書，知識分子義不容辭。</p>
<p>在寫悔過書，固然是常事；不但目不識丁的難友，在辦事人方面，也要有人代寫一下子才好，因為，非此不足以完成辦事的手續。代別人寫悔過書，本來也並不困難，只要把判决書拿來一查，如果已有口供，承認了犯罪的事實，那末照這做文章，發揮一下子，說幾句反省話，表明懊悔，照例的“以前認賊作父，”“現在已經覺悟，”“此後决不再犯”的來一套；再把這些話告訴本人，呌他記住就是了。要是沒有過認罪的口供，無論冤枉不冤枉，儘可以硬的承認起罪狀來，沒有事實的不妨假造一些，有着同案子的，先在暗中接個頭就行。反正“出去以後再說，”免得“拖牢洞。”</p>
<p>這位難友的悔過書，却的確有點難寫，並非因為他認不得漢文，在悔過書上面說謊話，總要能夠自並其說才好，否則露出“馬脚”來，給山反省院來談話的人看穿，準定是個“不給你解。”他的事情，是難以說圓滿的了；和他同案子的有七個，時常給他剃得光油油的一個剃工犯以外，還有做過英文教員的，也有商人，也有大學生，又有做過油漆匠的，方面既然多了。關係自然複雜起來，不可以像單獨一個案子的凭空亂造事由。他的罪名是“交通，”因為運送了做宣傳品的書籍。不過照他說來，當初實在沒有知道個中的眞情：</p>
<p>“阿拉船上人，帶眼東西賺　外欵，怎曉得××黨不××黨！”</p>
<p>他說得現直氣爽，也是很自然的。</p>
<p>呌他帶書的人，曾經在法庭上說過，他不曾加入過組織；他自己是滿口否認犯罪的。但這比承認了罪狀的更壞，因此說他不反省，判了他五年的有期徒刑；——承認了罪狀的幾個，算作已經悔過，减輕二分之一，都只判得兩年半。呌他帶書的人已經自殺，偷偷的撕開西裝袴子，後半夜上吊，死無對證了。</p>
<p>“沒有參加組織的人，當然不告訴他實在的事情！”</p>
<p>許多老客人都這樣說；所以，他要改口承認罪狀，是說不圓的了；不承認罪狀却不能算作悔過書，這就成了僵局。</p>
<p>後來調櫳子，分開了，我轉到東邊的小櫳子裏，他仍然關中央的大櫳子；不過在工塲裏面，還是時常可以見到的。</p>
<p>“悔過書怎麼寫寫？”每次碰到，見面以後，他照例開口就先問我這一句。如果談話，寒喧到了五句以上，他曾得再這樣來一下：</p>
<p>“悔過書怎麼寫寫？”</p>
<p>本來我已把他的姓名記得很熟，連他的番號都已隨口說得出來；因為老是這樣問我，如果不了解他，是難免覺得討厭的，上了工塲以後，只要遠遠的望見他，我總就這樣想着：“悔過書來了！”</p>
<p>漸漸的，於是忘却了他的眞姓名，也不再記得他的番號，只把他當作悔過書看待了。</p>
<h3>歲尾年頭</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>携者重沉的脚，</p>
<p>又默然踏過了多難的一年。</p>
<p>依舊在毫無辦法的，</p>
<p>情景下挨到了大除夕。</p>
<p>照例將一年的殘破心境，</p>
<p>要在這歲暮的日子作結束。</p>
<p>翹首企望着新的一年，</p>
<p>但願生之厭倦將隨着，</p>
<p>這多難的年頭逝去。</p>
<p>何需回頭？</p>
<p>那些算不清的愁恨，</p>
<p>窮難的生活下，</p>
<p>偏有輕夢來逗我的心魂，</p>
<p>但我那敢有詩人的痴情，</p>
<p>徒然多一層酸心記憶。</p>
<p>那些刺傷我心的往事，</p>
<p>逝去吧隨着殘冬峭寒的風。</p>
<p>依然是一片寂寞心境，</p>
<p>惘然看一年爬過去。</p>
<p>但是我還要生活，</p>
<p>要堅毅地抗着窮困，</p>
<p>抗着心之寂寞。</p>
<p>要繼續爬過遙長的艱困路途，</p>
<p>且希冀著明日吧！</p>
<p>於是我振一振疲倦精神，</p>
<p>挺一挺懶惰的腰身。</p>
<p>堅决地揮着拳頭，</p>
<p>勉强浮起一朵笑，</p>
<p>張開了手臂迎着新的一年。</p>
<h3>作為戲曲家的比蘭台羅</h3>
<p>— 旅岡</p>
<p>十二月十日，哈瓦斯羅馬電：“意大利著名戲曲家兼小說家比蘭台羅（Luigi　pirandello),並於一九三四年，獲得諾貝爾，文學獎金；頃於今晨八時，以肺炎症逝世。……”這段消息似乎還不很令人注意。不過比蘭台羅在中國也不能算是一個陌生的作家，也許是內為曾經做過“帮兇”，願為幕沙里尼効命疆塲，宣言馳赴東非去征服阿比西尼亞，而使大家失卻了興趣吧？……可是無論如何，他在藝術上的成就和影響倒也不容我們忽視的。</p>
<p>其實，比蘭台羅也並不是一個“道地”的法西主義的作家，有人說他是個自由主義者，可是我覺得這種說法也不大恰當，總之，他似乎是近於傾向法西主義底“半路出家”的人物。然而，菲勒特（Nicolas　Ferretti)郤又是另一種說法，說他是個懷疑主義的詩人。自然，他也自有他的道理，比方，他說：“……在比蘭台羅的眼光看來，法西主義的國土因感覺生活的空虛，祇有增加人物的靈魂上的苦惱，不幸和失敗而已。”“所以，比蘭台羅所描寫的人物在探討的確實性便變成不可捉摸的了；由此產生了懷疑，混亂，苦惱，失望。”但是，實際上菲勒特的說法，差不多可說是從心理學的觀點上出發的。只是，光從這一觀點來批判和觀察比蘭台羅的全部作品，或他底藝術的發展過程，似乎還不大適當。因為寄賦在他底藝術之中，還存在着他的頭腦—他的理想。</p>
<p>比蘭台羅的思想，是被限制於他所處的社会和环境之中的，所以菲勒特说：“各人有各人的眞理”是幾個劇本連成的題目：這是比蘭台羅的全部哲學。”這話說得很有道理。而且；這也說明了比蘭台羅在這些劇本是所表現的思想是什麼？……因此，“比蘭台羅的思想充滿了許多苦惱，而與詭辯派，普魯達科拉，諤治亞的思想或修謨的思想或正在互解中的黑格爾主義融成一片”。這思想的成果，也有了根源：他被法西主義的“精神牢獄”所囿囚，他的藝術界限被限制住了，“他跑不出‘自然’的界限外，並且陷於失望或大然的苦惱之中。”</p>
<p>長期的懷疑和苦惱，以及尋不出去路的絕望，終於使他信賴了上帝。—這自然是在法西斯治下底人類的精神的悲劇。</p>
<p>—忘我：信仰上帝。</p>
<p>比蘭台羅之所以如此終局，是絲毫也不足奇異的。他看不見世界，即使就是略為窺見了一些“小天地”，他也不敢在他底作品中表現出來，菲勒特說他在“作品中，凡是歷史環境，社會環境的直接描寫，他總謹愼地避開。”—這確是可哀的事實。這結果，他只好永遠描寫心理的衝突，老是探討靈魂里面的眞實。……有時，他的藝術作品都描寫兩個時代的心理，以及社會的矛盾的。可是這大抵已是大戰以前的事。往往在他底作品之中你可以看到一種可怕的心理表現：他的結果是憤激和瘋狂。……這極現於他底戲曲中似乎更其明白，因為他底戲曲中的人物大都為最複雜的矛盾底心理所苦。恰如他本身的思想那末陷於困頓之中。……</p>
<p>有人認為他的戲劇是”理想戲劇，恐怕還是在乎他是表現了自己的理想和全部哲學的原故。……在他底畢生之中，似乎在戲曲上的成就比之他在可說或詩歌上的成就更受偉大一些。而他底文藝生活的出發，好像也是最先從事於詩歌的創作的。</p>
<p>他不愧為一個天才的詩人，戲曲家兼小說家。他以一八六七年六月二十八日生於直戎蒂（Cirgenli)，故鄉是西西里島（Sicile)。一八九一年，他在德國的朋恩大學（Bouo　University)畢了業，隨後在一八九七—一九二四年間，在羅馬教會的婦女高等學院當修辭學和美學教援。一九二九年三月十八日，為政府任命為“意大利文學院”的會員。這之間，他兼從畢於文學的寫作。在大戰之前，他在藝術上已經有了不小的成就。那時候大抵是寫小說為多。除掉已經收集起來底二十四卷“一年的短篇小說”而外，長篇小說有：一九○一年所寫“被除名的婦人，”一九一二年所寫的“已故的馬蒂亞•巴斯卡爾，”一九三一年寫的“老與少”，一九一六年寫的“轉變了”以及“一個，沒有半個人與無數人”……等等。他底戲曲的寫作大抵是比較後一些時期的。而他底晚年，也大抵以寫戲曲為多。在戲曲集“赤裸裸的假面具”里，就幾幾乎包涵了四十多篇的戲曲。這里有：“光榮的逸樂”（一九一八），“職務的游戲（一九一八），“各人有各人的眞理”（一九一八），“可是，這不是嚴重的事”（一九一九），“像從前，郤比從前還好”（一九二一），“搜查主犯的六個人物”（一九二一），“亨利第四”一九二二），“給裸體的人穿起衣服來”（一九二三），“各人有各人的樣子”（一九二四），“醫生的義務”（一九二六），“新殖民地”（一九二八），“今晚就做”（一九二二），“像你希望我的那樣”（一九三二），“存在”（一九三二），“當人家是一個人物的時候”（一九三三）。……等。其中“新殖民地”一篇曾對於法西主義下一個嚴格的批判，自然，這當然也不足以作反比蘭台羅反對法西主義的明證。菲勒特說得好：“以比蘭台羅的作品為基礎的世界幻覺，在領域中很能夠促成意大利資產階級從事組織法西斯蒂狄克推多制。”但是要是因此就說他在替法西主義作宣傳，或反過來說他是反法西主義，那又完全是不正確的。所以，事實確難使人肯定；他是一個“澈底”的法西主義的人物，因之也就無怪乎他在維爾達國際大會上因說藝不當作為政治的工具而為馬里尼蒂（Marinetti)—一個法西主義的未來派作家—所抨擊。更無怪乎法西主義的批評家把他的藝術認為是“不道德”的藝術，把劇本“繼承兒童的神話”從皇家歌劇院的節目中抽出來。……如今他到底死了，似乎也正是待人“盜棺輪定”的時候。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>鉅額乾繭裝運出口</h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>我們才大聲疾呼地為“原料告罄”以至“被迫停車”的絲廠呼籲，而却竟然在報上看到了鉅額乾繭裝運出口了，這不能不算是一件很痛心的事。</p>
<p>六日本報本埠新聞版揭載如下一則新聞：</p>
<p>“值此我周各絲廠因原料告罄，正相繼被迫停工之際。英商怡和洋行，瑞士商連納洋行，意商達豐洋行等，突告收買我國上等繭子，報關出口，運至意大利，瑞士，法國等處。其收買價格，特別提高，例如三百五十斤繅折之上等繭子，其價每担乾繭，約合國幣二百五十元。聞已有千餘担乾繭，報關運裝出口。上海絲廠業同業公會，召集緊急會議，决：函江海關調查出口數目及稅率；呈請市府速設法制止，或轉呈財政當局提高出口稅率。又，查出口原因，傳說不一。或謂充工業原料用，或謂充製軍火（如火藥）用。</p>
<p>在去年，我們已感到絲廠被迫停車是一件最可痛恨的事情，而今年才開頭，三日晚報更發表驚人消息：“原料缺乏，市價高漲，絲廠什九停工。計全市一百十三家，去年已只四十八家開工，而目前存者且不滿二十家。而此二十家，預料廢曆年應均將停工。”可見這一現象已江河日下，如無萬全之策，决不能挽回了。關於這問題，筆者已在去年十二月二十二日“談言”上指出，這也是“人為的陰謀”。當時，對這問題的了解，已認為這不單純是因為“秋繭秋收”而至原料告罄，而實在不過是“春繭存貨為奸商屯積”。現在，事實已證明這不是“誣陷”了。</p>
<p>一方面是“原料告罄絲廠被迫停車”而一方面却是“鉅額乾繭裝運出口”，這總不能承認是“好現象”。本來，在殖民地狀態下的我國，以原料易人的成貨，已是一件被迫着做的事了。我們要不為人操縱，當然，是除了打開了別人為我們預備好的枷鎖不行的。現在，事實更給予我們的民族工業家以一個很好的榜樣。固然，首當其衝的絲廠業的實業家們應該把這件事認識得清清楚楚，而其他的實業家們，更應“兎死狐悲”，大家都覺悟起來，從基本的工作的努力，以達到我們的要求。</p>
<p>比方，絲廠業同業公會此次决議的補救辦法，請求“制止”輸出，和“提高出口稅率”，那便非要我們的國家不受帝國主義的欺凌不可。同時，對於一般“囤積居奇”的奸商，我們的民族工業家們更應該充分地暴露他們的“漢奸相”，而利用集體的力量去“制裁”他們。“求之於人，不如求之於己”，我們民族工業家們應該在“國防第一”這一口號集中實力，那是足以對付和摧毀一切橫暴的勢力的。</p>
<p>最後，我們更應予以深刻的注意的，那便是雖然不十分證實，但却是“可能”的便是鉅額乾繭裝運出口，是為了供給別人製造軍火的。一方面高價收買，毀我微弱民族工業；一方面又製造軍火來保證他們的侵略勝利。我們想：我們中國在列强的虎視（尤其是我們的民族最大敵人）下，我們是多末可憐的一匹小獸啊！</p>

<h3>原雪上</h3>
<p>— 張海</p>
<p>遼闊無邊的原野，平坦坦的像海一般的在多克博山脚下展開：望不見樹木，望不見村落，望不見蒙古包和牲畜羣，也望不見土地的顏色。從雲隊到山嶺，目力所及的地方，全蓋上了一層溶溶閃光的自雪，白白茫茫，彷彿天使將天鵝絨撒遍了這宇宙，要把塵世的要濁掩蔽。在這純潔的雪原上是那麼冷落，連禽獸都絕跡不見，世界完全變成了單純，孤寂。</p>
<p>駱駝的笨重的蹄子不停的在雪上踐踏，被蹂躪的雪跡，漸漸地在後面拖長，貝吉爾昨夜沒睡覺，這當兒儘仔打哈欠，頭搭拉着，眼睛又睜不開。長久的時間我沒注意他，那唯一的可以驚醒雪原的駝鈴把我吸引住了；牠的調子平均而有節奏，曠野中是無與比擬的音饗了。</p>
<p>“貝吉爾，到大青山還有多少略？”</p>
<p>“蹣過前面額齊巴魯山就是達拉特沙漠，再往南就是大青山了；可是咱們到平地泉還得四五天呢。”</p>
<p>貝吉爾是蒙古人，屬於“喀爾喀”族。三年前我到西伯利亞繞道內外蒙古時，在穆尼色認識了他，他送我一張蒼糖色的狐皮，願我永久的留在他家中住下。這次我要到西康去，路過賽烏特却不期而遇到他。</p>
<p>“蒙古人都願打矮鬼子，連喇嘛也氣得耐不住性兒”！夜裏睡在皮被裏他很興奮的對我說，</p>
<p>此刻我們倆兒是帶着五十件賽烏特地方的牧民捐集的羊皮衣，遠遠地送給綏東的民族戰士。</p>
<p>嚴冬的太陽，害癰癱症似的，半點見掙扎的力氣也沒有？凍雲老遮攔她，戲玩她，簡直任什麼都欺侮她。雪錯點見沒給陽光融化，暴風却打遙遠的沙漠上兇猛的冲奔而來，狂肆的咆哮，無阻無撓的在廣闊的雪野中激動寒流，凝鑄雪粒，把微弱無力的陽光擊敗了。漸漸，地上一處一處凸起來，一處一處凹下去，顯而易見，這白花花的雪地，要長起雪嶺來。</p>
<p>雪粒伴着風浪，掃着鼻子，掃着駱駝的頭和頸，貝吉爾騎的駱駝忽然躺下，差一點兒把他摔下來，他跨下來，毫不在意的樣子，打起駱駝，仍然騎上去再走。</p>
<p>傍近額賽巴魯山下時，他再三的囑附我說：</p>
<p>“前面山上常有馬賊，逮往人要割耳漿，剖脚心！聽說××人還來這裏照過像片，不知幹啥用，我們得特別小心，要碰上馬賊就算完兒啦。他們都有新傢伙，××給他們的。”</p>
<p>雖說他的臉藏在羊皮帽中使我看不出他的神情，但相信他是懷着警戒心，一定他身上的血在急激的循環。他在駱駝身上禱告：</p>
<p>“天保佑我們把這些東西平平安安的送到那些弟兄們跟前”！</p>
<p>直到我們的駱駝踏上了達拉特沙漠時，貝吉爾才從恐懼中恢復了平靜，輕快的不停吸着烟。</p>
<p>風和雪無休止的戰鬥着。</p>
<h3>白菜</h3>
<p>— 廖楚咻</p>
<p>這幾天，白菜一物，是頗為入時的蔬菜。在上海，也是論担論斤的買賣，魯迅先生所說的：“掛在水果店的檐下，論雨出售，做魚翅的襯底，”是只指一種天津白菜而言。</p>
<p>羣芳譜蔬譜云：“白菜一名菘，諸菜中，最堪常食。有二種，一種莖圓厚微青，一種莖扁薄而白。葉皆淡青白色，子如蕓薹子而灰黑，八月種，二月開黃花，四瓣如芥花，三月結角，亦如芥。燕趙遼陽淮揚所種者，最肥大而厚，一本重十餘斤者。南方者，畦內過冬，北方多入窖內；燕京圃人，又以馬糞入窖壅培，不見風日，長出，苗葉皆嫩黃色，脆美無滓，謂之黃芽菜，乃白菜別種。莖葉皆扁，味甘溫無毒，利腸胃，除胸煩，解酒湯，利大小便，和中止嗽，冬汁尤美。夏至前，菘柴盒，療皮膚癢，動氣發病，又有春不老，一名八斤菜，葉如白菜而大，甚脆嫩，四時可種，醃食甚美，”</p>
<p>埤雅云：“菘性凌冬不雕，四時長有，有松之操，故其字會意。”這大概眞是白菜所以名菘的緣故。</p>
<p>本草云：“最肥大者，名牛肚菘。”菜譜云：“有春菘，有晚菘。”所以，南齊書周顒傳：“顒清貧寡欲，終身長菜食。文惠太子問顒，菜食何味長勝？即曰：春初早韭，秋末晚菘。”春初的早韭，自然是指現在的韭芽，而晚菘的佳於春菘，也於此可見。</p>
<p>白菜之為平民常食的東西，大概由來已久。所以，古人總以食菘表示儉樸。南齊書武陵昭王傳：“尚書令王儉詣曄，曄留儉食，枰中菘菜鮑魚而已。”</p>
<p>其實，白菜這東西在蔬菜中，不能算盤好吃的一種。韭芽，菠菜，薺菜，就在牠之上，不過滋味，頗為“中庸，”同時又多，所以人就常食之了。其實，討厭白菜的人，也并不是沒有：</p>
<p>清異録：“江右多菘菜，粥筍者惡之，罵曰：‘心子菜，蘆筍奴菌妾也。’”這雖則是粥筍者因為白菜太多，而搶了他筍的市塲，但白菜和筍比較，實在不過居奴的地位；不要說和香菌比了。</p>
<p>“大兵之後，必有凶年，”這是老子的話。然而白菜偏偏不是那樣，他在大兵之後，并不同別的菜蔬同樣的“饉，”而反大長特長。</p>
<p>輟耕錄載：“揚州至王丙申丁酉間，兵燹之餘，城中屋址，遍生白菜，大者重十五斤，小者亦不下八九斤，有勞力人所負，才四五窠耳。”然而這種說法，也不見得正確，目前兵戈滿地，而白菜也不見得比從前格外的長大。</p>
<p>謝肇制王雜知云：“京師隆冬有黃芽菜韭黃，蓋富室地窖火坑中所成，貧民不能辦也。”那末，所謂黃芽菜，一定要從“火坑地窖中焙出”“苗葉發黃者”始稱。而目前江南人，則一切白菜，都呌牠黃芽菜了。</p>
<p>其實，白菜與其說好吃，不如說好玩。目前上海人家有一種種在盆裏的“紅紫菘菜，”自然俗不堪耐。而沈三白浮生六記所載的：“黃芽菜心，其白如玉，取大小五七株，用沙土植長方盆內，以炭代石，黑白分明，颇有意思。”實在較水仙等尤佳。</p>
<p>關於菘菜的專門著述，自以梁簡文帝謝敕賚大菘啟為最早，文有云：“吳愧千里之尊，蜀慚七菜之賦，是知泮宮折芹，空入魯詩，流火烹葵，徒專豳典。”則極讚白菜了。</p>
<p>最後，我更得說明的，就是古人所說菜，都是指白菜而言，而以凡是關於白菜的著述，總是把古人說到菜的，都收在裏邊。至於我，自然不能不謹嚴一點，只錄一些說明菘菜的著述了。</p>
<h3>玉成頭家的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 江天</p>
<p>擁有着十幾個燒瓷窯，各地開有十多家分店的玉成老店，是高坡鎭上最大的一家製瓷號，誰也知道，玉成頭家（粤諺老板）是最會經營的人物。</p>
<p>玉成頭家今年已經是五十左右的年紀了，但是他的經營生意的雄心，還沒有哀退，他還時時在說：“雖然我們這里的出品總是趕不上江西景德鎭的好，聲名還沒有他大，不過根據着我二三十年來的經騐，我想不久總可以趕得上他的，不是嗎，現在在南邊一帶和南洋各地，我們的出品不是很有出路很有聲名嗎？”</p>
<p>不錯，玉成頭家的確是富有事業野心的人，高坡瓷的會有今日的出路，玉成頭家總算是一名功臣，在二三十年前，那時這鎭上還只是幾個很小的燒瓷窯，所出產的，也只是一些粗陋的盤碗之類，銷售的地方不過是鄰近各村莊，可是玉成頭家却認為這生意有出路，於是盡力的經營，把一些祖田也賣成錢來開新窯漸漸地又在各地開分銷店，而出品上，更是什麼都有，只要是用的瓷器，他都製造，銷路因此也漸漸旺了，而鎭上別的店家，也跟着謀發展，這樣一來，在十年前的高坡瓷器已是銷到南洋去了，誰也知道高坡是南中國產瓷有名的地方，而開發這種生意的玉成頭家，却已變成鎭上的大富翁了，別的不說，單是靠他的燒瓷窯的工作吃飯的人，就有數千人了，而玉成兩字的招牌更是買瓷器的人所知道，玉成盤碗就好像陳嘉庾鞋一樣的馳名了。</p>
<p>玉成頭家的這樣會經營，無怪乎他時時誇口說要把高坡瓷經營到像江西景德鎭的那樣有名。不過近幾年來，高坡瓷的銷路却有點變了，到處都堆積着一棧一棧的存貨，尤其是南洋的銷路，簡直是沒有了。</p>
<p>這現象，使太成頭家苦惱着，他只有時對着同行的頭家們在罵着：</p>
<p>“媽的，都是倭鬼子，把貨價賣低來奪去我們的銷路，也有這些不成種的中國人去買，那些洋貨又不耐用，不過是好看一點吧了。我們現在只有把存貨便宜點的賣吧，我想洋貨總沒有久長的。”</p>
<p>玉成頭家滿以為把存貨賣便宜點就可打倒洋貨了，可是洋貨却又再低價了，終於存貨又賣不去，而一批批的新貨又存起來。像這親情形，鎭上已有幾家同行關門了，可是有大資本的玉成頭家，他却不怕，還是照樣的出產着。然而一年终於不如一年，各地的分店都說存貨太多，不能再製了，就連江西貨，也是一樣的敵不過洋貨。這才使玉成頭家着了急，看看到今年年底，鎭上的瓷窰</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>都只好停工了。</p>
<p>玉成頭家每天跑到河邊的棧房去，看看那棧里的貨物，是愈堆愈多，河里那些往時都是運他的瓷貨向外開去的紅頭木船，現在不是空着的停在江邊，就是裝成一艙艙的米了，這情形，使他一看頭就賓會不如洋貨嗎？</p>
<p>存貨是到處皆是了，玉成頭家終日就只好坐在客廳的紅木坑床上，抽着水烟捻着鬍子想着，终於他也只好把燒瓷窑的工作停頓了，他對工人們說：</p>
<p>“現在是因為沒有銷路，存貨太多，不得不把燒窯停止，這都是洋貨傾銷的關係，一候銷路轉好了，還是要開窯的，實在我要工的。”</p>
<p>玉成頭家看着工人失望的面孔，看着一點火烟也沒有的瓷窯，他也感到悲哀了。不過他心里還在想：“也許洋貨會有一日沒落下去吧。”然而這只是在安慰着他那悲哀的心情吧了，像這樣不知改良的土產，如何敵得過洋貨呢？這一點也許玉成頭家以及那些同行的人是沒有想到的。</p>

<h3>餘音P]　　交通部上海廣播電臺（一三○○）今日下午四時半至五時一刻請大夏大學顧邦基徐宏濟先生演講「教養兒童的話，」屆時希各界注意。電影「戲劇工作社」訪問記　　「日出」並不難産　　不久以前，本埠大小各報都登載着「戲劇工作社」排演「日出」的消息，並請由名戲劇家歐陽予倩担任該劇的導演。　　這消息自從傳出以後，不僅是一般愛好戲劇的觀衆們萬分屬目，就是文壇上也引起了相當的注意。因爲「日出」這劇本是曹禺先生最近的創作，曾經發表在文季月刋上，曹先生的第一次作品是「電雨」，他的成就，博得各方面的贊譽，認爲是最近中國傑出的劇作者。因此他的第二部創作「日出」凖備上演的消息揭露以後，茅盾，巴金，葉紹鈞，沈從文等許多文壇著名作家，曾在本埠大公報出特刋，對「日出」作集體的批評，一致稱道，認爲比「雷雨」有更進一歩的成功。　　所以凡是看過舞台上「雷雨」的觀衆，都盼望着「日出」的早日上演。但是前天消息傳來，有「日出」難産之説，究竟爲什麽？並没有説出來。記者是愛好戲劇的一份子，聽到了這消息，特地到「戲劇工作社」去訪問了一次。　　在那裏，他們一羣正在努力排練着，工作情形，非常緊張。找到負責人某君，問起關於「日出」難産的真相，據説這並不確實，事實上因爲「戲劇工作社」的大部份演員，都是「復旦劇社」的中堅份子，現在因爲寒假期近，各大學都在凖備大考，所以一部份演員因爲忙於考試的關係，不能够參加排練，因此工作無形停頓了二三天，所以有難産消息的誤傳，現在已加緊工作，大約不久即可與觀衆相見。　　愛好話劇的觀衆們！你們盼望「日出」嗎？這消息是一個喜訊。　　聯華鉅片「聯華交響曲」昨晚獻映　　華安公司出品聯華有聲鉅片「聯華交響曲，」係聯華八大導演全體明星合作巨片，原定元旦起在新光大戲院開映，因該公司另一巨片「孤城烈女」賣座鼎盛，展期至昨晚九時一刻獻映。（今日起每日開映三塲）該片包括影片八部，爲司徒慧敏導演之「兩毛錢」，費穆導演之「春閨夢斷」譚友六導演之「陌生人」，沈浮導演之「三人行」，賀孟斧導演之「月下小景」，宋石麟導演之「鬼」，孫瑜導演之「瘋人狂想曲」，及蔡楚生導演之「小五義」，內容充實，技術優秀，爲愛好聯華影片之觀衆所不願放棄之鉅片無疑。左明「生財有道」　　左明第二次編導的「王先生生財有道」開始攝製以來，已經將近三個月了。　　新年中左明收到許多朋友的賀年片，其中大多數賀年片上的語句比衆不同，便是在「恭賀新禧」之下，還接着一句「並祝生財有道成功」，這很明顯的，一方面他們利用這句「生財有道」的吉利語，一方面便是祝頌他「王先生生財有道」的成功，真可謂妙語雙關。　　左明是忠於藝術的，他專心要美滿地完成他的「王先生生財有道」，所以雖在新年中，他只休息了兩天，接着便繼續工作，不久便可「大功告成」了。大光明映「獸國女皇」　　大光明大戲院今日起開映派拉蒙公司傾全力攝製的獸片「獸國女王」The　Jungle　Princess。該片主角，爲健美女明星桃樂姗拉摩，獸片以女星任主角，除此片外，恐尚未之前見。內容有數千人猿進攻土著所居的村莊，猛虎與大豹的惡戰，妖妄土人的慘酷刑罰女人，溪間艷侣的裸泳等等場面。桃樂姗拉摩在，這部片子裏，有驅象使虎之能。有沉魚落雁之容，故較看一般毫無浪漫色彩的獸片，尤爲有趣，該院於公映此片時，並加映名貴短片榮膺金牌奬的五彩諧畫「無敵水手，」本片採用最新發明立體彩色，比三原色者更美麗傳神云。代郵　　葉維華先生：　　該項消息於去年十二月二十四日刋出，地址爲江灣翔殷路二九五四號杜鰲君，因係宣傳稿。請直接去信可也。　編者覆</h3>

<h3>Japan Orders Kawagoe to Continue Negotiations</h3>
<p>Tokyo has already instructed the Japanese ambassador; plans to hold negotiations before the 21st of this month; Foreign Ministry spokesperson denies this claim.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Today's Yomiuri Shimbun reports that the Foreign Ministry instructed Ambassador Kawagoe on the 6th to suggest to China that Sino-Japanese negotiations should continue, and that it would be preferable to hold them before the resumption of the Diet session on the 21st of this month. However, when a reporter inquired with the Foreign Ministry spokesperson today, the spokesperson replied that the aforementioned information was completely unfounded. Another report states that Japan naturally hopes that Sino-Japanese negotiations will continue, but the appropriate time for this seems yet to be decided. Japan believes it is currently necessary to observe China's political trends. Furthermore, Colonel Muto Akira, the Second Section Chief of the Kwantung Army, and Lieutenant Colonel Tanaka Ryukichi, a staff member of the same section, will soon be transferred to local posts.

<h3>Sino-Japanese War Is Not Inevitable</h3>
<p>Impressions of a British History Professor's Visit to the Far East</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, December 29th - After his first trip to the Far East, Cambridge University Modern History Professor, F.J.C. Hearnshaw, stated while passing through Singapore on his return to England that a Sino-Japanese war is not inevitable. Although the overall situation in the Far East is very serious, there is no reason to say that a solution that does not resort to force cannot be achieved. When I was in Nanjing, I was deeply moved by the enthusiasm of the general public for their belief in China's future. Hearnshaw is the President of the International Historical Congress and the author of several historical books.</p>

<h3>Japanese Ronin Attempt Riot in Zhengzhou</h3>
<p>Secretly establish organizations, collude with bandits, and sell drugs; Police dispatched to arrest, they dared to resist with guns</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Three ronin, Yamaguchi and others, hired the traitor Zhao Longtian, secretly established an organization at No. 9, Tongshang Lane, Zhengzhou, colluded with bandits, and attempted to riot. After investigation by the local authorities, the ronin and Zhao Longtian jumped over the back wall of their residence on the night of the 4th to engage in activities, and were captured by our police and sent to the First District Administrative Office. After a personal interrogation by Commissioner Ruan, Zhao Longtian confessed that he was hired by a certain foreigner in September last year, receiving a monthly salary of 40 yuan, specifically to go to Shanxi, Shaanxi, Bian, and Zhengzhou to spy on military intelligence, and collude with more than a thousand bandits in western Henan to plot a riot, sabotage transportation, rob express trains, prepare for more than a hundred ronin to come to Zhengzhou, establish a drug-selling organization, and take the opportunity to riot, etc. After the office obtained the confession, in addition to detaining Zhao Longtian and others, they dispatched personnel to inspect their residence again at 10:00 AM on the 5th.

<h3>Britain and Fascist Nations (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— By British MP Strabolgi, Translated by Jin Tunan</p>
<p>In the past, Britain had a strong fleet, and the sea surrounding its coasts, even a channel as wide as the twenty-two miles between England and France, provided sufficient defense. Now, due to the rapid increase in the effectiveness and number of European air forces, its entire position has changed. At the same time, Britain is also aware of the threat from Japan in the Pacific, as Japan's established policy is to move toward the Malay Federation under British protection and reach the gateway to India, which is strategically very important.</p>
<p>However, what the ruling class of Britain, social leaders, financiers, and the general upper class fear most is communism. In the minds of these people, the current governments of France and Spain are the same as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The general aristocracy and banking circles of Britain, fearing the threat of communism, mostly try their best to be pro-German. In addition, there are other forces at work, and generally speaking, German influence in Britain is growing.</p>
<p>This pressure and its repercussions have caused rifts within the British Cabinet regarding the most important policy issues of today. A portion of the cabinet members, roughly subordinate to the Prime Minister, want to make peace with Germany to obtain peace. Another portion of the cabinet members, however, believe that this is impossible to satisfy Germany. This group still believes in the traditional British policy of maintaining the balance of power in Europe for four hundred years, which is to constantly support unity and resist any strong nation becoming a hegemon. And the meaning of "balance" today is to show that the League of Nations and cooperation with the League of Nations should be strengthened.</p>
<p>For convenience, we can call this group the pro-French faction, which represents the majority of British voters who support the League of Nations. When the two factions clash, sometimes one faction's intentions extend, and sometimes the other faction's intentions extend.</p>
<p>When the German army reoccupied the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, the issue of breaking the Locarno Treaty caused tension between the foreign ministries of Britain and France.</p>
<p>Britain advocated leniency, while France advocated accountability and forced Germany to withdraw its troops. Any part of the British cabinet or government knew about Germany's breach of contract; however, someone had notified Hitler and his advisors of the British reaction beforehand. This notification was accurate, and British public opinion on this matter tended to side with Germany. This happened in March of this year.</p>
<p>In the autumn of last year, British public opinion supported the group favoring the League of Nations and being pro-French, leading to the overthrow of the Hoare-Laval Pact to partition Abyssinia. This group within the British Cabinet then prevented any public declaration in favor of restoring Germany's former colonies. However, this does not mean that a powerful group of key cabinet members and a group of the same nature as Germany did not have a secret understanding.</p>
<p>There is some evidence to prove this.</p>
<p>A subtle change can be seen in some authoritative newspapers, such as the famous London Times, which represents the views of the Foreign Office. These many opinion organs have gradually become anti-Soviet and pro-German. They are trying their best to support the position of Schacht, the financial dictator of Berlin. Some raw materials for German arms manufacturing are purchased with British money.</p>
<p>Last year, the British Admiralty—which has always been one of the most powerful departments in the British political system and often adopted its own foreign policy—signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, concealing it from the US and French governments. This matter was actually accomplished by Monsell. He was the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time and one of Prime Minister Baldwin's confidants. Although he has now retired, the trend of this policy is still maintained.</p>
<p>At the Montreux Conference held last summer regarding the issue of the Turkish Straits, the British representative alone argued for the right of enemy fleets to pass through the straits to reach the Black Sea in the event of war. This was particularly beneficial to Germany, even though Germany did not participate in the negotiations. This claim by Britain was unanimously opposed by France, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Romania, the three Black Sea coastal countries. According to Britain's attitude, it simply did not take the League of Nations into account, and in the end, the British representative had to give in. However, it was soon clearly revealed that this matter was initiated for the benefit of Germany.</p>
<p>In the complex process of the League of Nations attempting to suppress Italy with sanctions to maintain peace with Abyssinia, the right-wing government of France under the Laval cabinet was unwilling to break with Italy because it wanted to cooperate with Italy through the Locarno Treaty to contain Germany. However, British policy was exactly the opposite. The British government and public did not want to weaken Mussolini and the fascist government in Rome too much, because they feared the rise of the Italian left wing (which in their minds was the Communist Party). This view was also the main prejudice of the German government and the Foreign Office at the time. The British policy of not wanting to impose real sanctions on Italy—because sanctions would harm it—was welcomed by Berlin.</p>
<p>But from a long-term perspective, the establishment of a fascist empire in East Africa is not in Britain's interest. This not only threatens Britain's colonies but also threatens the sea route through the Red Sea to India. This affects Britain's prestige. In short, behind Britain's hesitant attitude, there are ulterior motives, especially at this time when preparations are being made to impose an oil embargo on Italy and when most of the cooperation with the United States under the Neutrality Act can be determined.</p>
<p>This ulterior motive is a secret agreement within the British government within the cabinet to meet Germany halfway and express reconciliation with Hitler, part of the price being to condone Germany's handling of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe. What Germany wants is a price higher than this, including interference in the Free City of Danzig, Britain, and Czechoslovakia. As for the policies and ideas of France, even if Germany could get half of its price, it would be directly opposed.</p>
<p>This trick is the preparation for the rupture between the United States and France, even if the terms of the Anglo-German deal do not include France and Belgium.</p>

<h3>Trends in Sino-Japanese Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Since the resolution of the Chengdu and Beihai incidents at the end of last year, there has been a trend for both China and Japan to engage in diplomatic negotiations again. Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe made a statement on the 5th to the Nanjing correspondent of the Asahi Shimbun, stating that Sino-Japanese negotiations may be continued in the near future. At the same time, there are rumors that the authorities in North China and the Japanese side are also resolving outstanding issues. We hope that there are no other hidden agendas behind these messages, and that they only indicate the establishment of a correct concept on the part of Japan for resolving Sino-Japanese issues.</p>
<p>Looking at the exchange of documents between China and Japan regarding the resolution of the Chengdu and Beihai incidents, we cannot help but admit that this is a gratifying start to clearing the gloomy atmosphere between the two countries. Setting aside the content, the establishment of these exchanges ultimately indicates a turn towards a correct concept on the part of Japanese diplomacy. That is, recognizing that incidents like Chengdu and Beihai are ordinary, individual local cases, and not drawing any ambiguous conclusions from them that would cause further disputes. For example, some Japanese people previously interpreted the Chengdu and Beihai incidents as a representation of China's entire anti-Japanese movement. If the Japanese side can truly adjust the relationship between the two countries based on such a realistic diplomatic concept, we believe that the future of diplomatic negotiations between the two sides will definitely return to a clear atmosphere.</p>
<p>In light of the recent situation of diplomatic developments, we believe that we Chinese people should have a new awakening. If the recent Sino-Japanese diplomacy has increased the possibility of gradual stabilization, we should see that such a change is a reflection of our nation's unity and solidarity. For example, even in terms of resolving the Chengdu and Beihai incidents, if last year's Xi'an Incident had been delayed and not resolved quickly, or even if a major and unfortunate rift had occurred internally, perhaps the negotiations on these two cases would not have been resolved to this day. Even if they were resolved, they would probably have been different in content than they are now. In his recent statement, Kawagoe also said, "The Xi'an Incident lasted only two weeks, but it occurred at the most critical time. The Chinese National Government's handling of the aftermath and the people's trust in the government are both extremely noteworthy. This is clear evidence of China's great progress." Although the diplomat's rhetoric cannot be fully believed to be true, the publication of such a view does have a factual basis. This fact will change the beliefs and attitudes of diplomatic opponents, thereby forming a new turn in the development of diplomatic negotiations. From this, it can be seen that we can only achieve a smooth resolution of diplomacy if we are united from top to bottom and concentrate our strength.</p>
<p>We believe that clearing the low pressure between China and Japan is not only our Chinese people's wish, but also something that Japanese people are very concerned about. If the relationship between China and Japan is not thoroughly improved, East Asian peace, no matter how loudly it is proclaimed, is probably just a bubble and a flower in the mirror. If East Asian peace cannot be achieved, it will definitely affect the future of world peace. For the sake of the peace of the entire human race, and for the sake of peace in East Asia, we dare to respectfully present the two points mentioned above to the people of China and Japan.</p>
<h3>Japan Adjusts Relations with Russia</h3>
<p>Resolving Border Issues, Differences in Opinions Between Both Parties</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The main existing issues between Japan and Russia are the conclusion of a new fisheries treaty and the establishment of a border commission. In order to resolve these outstanding issues as soon as possible, Foreign Minister Arita has decided to invite the Russian Ambassador to Japan to the Foreign Ministry within days to urge negotiations. On the issue of the Manchurian-Russian border, Japan and Russia generally agree, but there remain three issues on which the two sides have not seen eye to eye: ① the organization of the border processing committee, ② prior to the confirmation of the border, the existing border should be recognized as the legitimate border, and ③ the dispute processing committee should manage all border incidents.

<h3>Roosevelt Announces Policy Guidelines to Congress</h3>
<p>Promoting the New Deal Based on the Constitution, Banning Arms Shipments to Spain, Both Houses of Congress Quickly Pass</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt read his annual message to Congress today, announcing the purpose of the "Second New Deal" to the people. The House chamber was crowded with listeners. The President, in a clear voice, stated that the National Industrial Recovery Act could be made legal without amending the Constitution. (This point is very important, as some had already anticipated that after this election, the government, having gained the trust of the majority of the people, would re-propose the National Industrial Recovery Act and overcome all constitutional issues.) The President also stated that circumstances forced him to make the following requests:</p>
<p>① Extend the powers granted by the previous Congress that are about to expire.</p>
<p>② Further promote neutrality legislation to deal with the situation caused by the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>③ Add to this year's budget.</p>
<p>It has been customary for American presidents to send written messages to Congress. Roosevelt personally read his message last time, and this time he followed the same precedent. In addition to the members of the Senate and House of Representatives, the gallery was filled with cabinet members, foreign guests, celebrities, and ordinary people. Most notably, none of the judges of the Supreme Court were present, so they did not hear the President's frank criticism of their interpretation of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The President said, "The operation of American democracy must not be endangered by refusing the necessary powers of a free government. Therefore, the judiciary must also strive for the success of democracy. Now, the executive and legislative branches can cooperate closely. Although we do not seek for the court to produce powers that do not exist, the powers within the scope of the Constitution should be made as effective as possible to enhance the welfare of the public."</p>
<p>The President further stated that he firmly believed that the goals of the National Industrial Recovery Act were quite sound, but it was unavoidable that it was too much to digest. Although the current law has expired, the current problems have not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>The President also advocated that federal laws should supplement the deficiencies of state laws in order to solve the social and economic problems caused by modern inventions that transcend state borders. As for constitutional issues, the President believed that the people have come to understand more clearly in the past year that there is nothing wrong with the Constitution. Therefore, the current urgent need is not to amend the Constitution, but to interpret it clearly. If it can be interpreted properly, it can be a tool for progress and not an obstacle to any action.</p>
<p>The President opposed unlimited overproduction and the suppression of production by monopolies. The interests of the country depend entirely on the government assisting private industries to maintain stable prices and preventing them from rising and falling sharply.</p>
<p>Finally, the President addressed foreign policy issues, saying that militarism has become rampant in oligarchical countries. (National Telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>[Washington] After President Roosevelt's message was read, both houses of Congress passed the bill to prohibit the export of arms, ammunition, and military supplies to Spain or their transit to Spain by a large majority last night. The bill was passed after a short discussion, which was unprecedented in its speed. (Reuters dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<h3>Brutality of the Spanish War Leads to Amendment of American Neutrality Law</h3>
<p>To Take Effect Upon Signature on Friday, Batch of Arms Hurriedly Shipped Out</p>
<p>[Washington] The Senate and the House of Representatives voted today to pass an amendment to the current Neutrality Act proposed by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stipulating that all kinds of military supplies are prohibited from being shipped to Spain, and any recently issued export permits for military supplies to Spain will also be cancelled as a result.</p>
<p>The bill states, "The Spanish revolution is a rare and brutal war, and its war is likely to spread beyond the borders of Spain. Therefore, the export of American military supplies to Spain poses a great danger to the security and peace of the United States itself, and is also contrary to the neutral policy of the United States. In this situation, it is necessary to pass a bill immediately."</p>
<p>The bill also stipulates, "All arms, ammunition, and military supplies are prohibited from being transported from the United States or its territories to Spain, or from being transported to other countries for the purpose of being transported to the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War. Violators of this prohibition will be fined $10,000 or imprisoned for five years."</p>
<p>The military supplies specified in the bill as prohibited are the same items specified in President Roosevelt's declaration of arms embargo during the war between Italy and Abyssinia on April 10 last year. All non-military aircraft and their dismantled parts are also prohibited. The effective period will be determined by President Roosevelt. (Havas dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Both houses of Congress convened today, and the bill proposed by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to prohibit arms shipments to Spain passed smoothly without objection. President Roosevelt thus won a great victory, but several speakers at the time stated that they voted in favor because the current international situation is serious and they had to take expedited procedures in legislation. However, they did not agree that the only way to safeguard American neutrality was to prohibit arms exports. It seems that if Congress expects to follow the government's wishes in discussing the new Neutrality Act this month, as it did today, it may not be entirely true. However, all parties praised President Roosevelt's message. Although some believed that the President's speech would have been more practical, observers said that the President's lack of lofty rhetoric further showed his agility. Because the President has an unprecedented majority in this Congress, he did not want to exceed the scope of his authority on major national policies and would rather let the Senate and House of Representatives propose bills on their own. Therefore, in his message, the President only proposed two things to Congress: ① The resolution to prohibit arms shipments to Spain should be passed. ② Regarding the issue of organizing financial relief for unemployment, certain privileges currently enjoyed by the government should be extended by Congress in order to achieve complete success. In addition, well-informed sources also stated that the President is also planning several measures on domestic affairs to be submitted to Congress for discussion. (Havas dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<p>[New York] The Spanish cargo ship Mar Cantabrico, loaded with eighteen American aircraft and four hundred and eleven engines, bound for the Republican government in the Spanish port of Valencia, cast off at 6:45 p.m. and sailed to the Spanish port of Cadiz. Beforehand, the ship's crew and dockworkers hurriedly loaded the cargo in order to ship it out before Congress passed the new Chinese Civil Law Act and extended the arms embargo measures to the Spanish Civil War. However, after the Mar Cantabrico cast off and sailed past Sandy Hook Point, a coast guard patrol boat and an aircraft rushed to order it to return to the port of New York. Fortunately, an order from Washington arrived shortly thereafter, granting permission to leave, so the Mar Cantabrico was able to sail out. (Havas dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<h3>American Volunteers Also Eager to Fight for Spain</h3>
<p>Six Hundred Men Will Depart from New York, Britain Opposes Blockade of Spain, Rebel Army Continues Siege of Capital</p>
<p>[San Francisco] The California Secretary of the Socialist Party, Mr. Qu Bai'er, declared today that he is currently recruiting volunteers, intending to send hundreds to Spain to assist the government army in combat. Twenty people have already applied, including veterans of the European War and one aviator who participated in the Sino-Japanese War of 1932. There are also several chemists and one striking seaman. New York also has five hundred volunteers scheduled to depart on the 19th of this month. It is said that those recruited here will join them. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[London] The British Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Drummond, today conveyed to the Italian Foreign Ministry his serious concern regarding the continued dispatch of large numbers of Italian volunteers to Spain. He requested that Italy provide a written reply to the previous notes from Britain and France within this week. It is reported that Germany has also received similar urgent requests. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The government decided today to halt the continued dispatch of volunteers to Spain before responding to the neutrality proposals of Britain and France. None of the soldiers stationed in southeastern Germany have volunteered today. Officials have expressed satisfaction with this. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the proposal by Britain and France to prohibit volunteers from going to Spain, responsible persons recently declared that the German government's reply will still be sent out today. It is said that its content reiterates the country's views and will not differ greatly from those of Italy in essence. It is unknown whether this reply will be delivered by the ambassadors of Britain and France in Berlin or by the German ambassadors to Britain and France to the governments of their respective host countries. The main points generally include the following three items: ㊀ The German government advocates that the issue of non-intervention should be resolved comprehensively. In other words, various indirect methods of intervention, especially financial assistance, must be prohibited simultaneously with the dispatch of volunteers. ㊁ Foreign political personnel currently in Spain must be withdrawn. This clearly refers to Soviet personnel, because these personnel are reportedly holding important positions in the Spanish government. ㊂ This reply will also clarify that the views of Germany and Italy are completely consistent. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>[Paris] An international brigade composed of left-wing individuals from various countries, totaling about two thousand people, crossed the border at Bobigny at 1:00 PM today and traveled by train to Barcelona, Spain. Poles are the most numerous among them. There is also a medical team, including one American. Forty Soviet anti-aircraft guns were simultaneously transported to Bilbao. A French government spokesperson told the Associated Press today that France is preparing to participate in a naval, land, and air blockade of Spain to prevent any goods other than food and medicine from being transported to Spain, but this requires the cooperation of Germany, Italy, and Russia. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The French Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Poncet, was originally scheduled to return to France on Friday to meet with Foreign Minister Delbos. It is now learned that his departure has been postponed. Some newspapers here believe that Mr. Poncet may be conducting important talks with the German authorities and therefore is not leaving his post immediately. An afternoon newspaper reported, "The German authorities believe that it is time for Germany and France to conduct direct negotiations to clarify the situation." (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>[London] Someone from the Foreign Office declared that the expert committee of the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee for the Spanish Civil War, when holding a plenary meeting in Shanghai, had discussed the proposal to blockade the Spanish coast. At that time, the British representative stated that if Japan, the United States, and the countries of Central and South America did not join the Spanish Non-Intervention Agreement, the British government would oppose the principle of blockading the Spanish coast. Therefore, the Spanish coastal surveillance plan drafted by the experts only stipulated that the coast of that country should be patrolled by warships dispatched by various countries. When suspicious ships are found, their actions can only be reported to the port surveillance committee, and no direct investigation should be initiated. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Avila The Nationalist forces launched an attack in the vicinity of Madrid yesterday, advancing ten kilometers from south to north and six kilometers from west to east. The northwestern suburbs of Madrid are therefore increasingly falling under the control of the Nationalist forces. The front line in the western suburbs is closer to Madrid, but it is calm and peaceful. Furthermore, the government army suffered a large number of casualties during yesterday's fierce attack by the Nationalist forces. Military experts have declared that yesterday's battle was the most important in the entire campaign to besiege Madrid. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Avila This newspaper's correspondent, Pete, reports that the weather cleared up yesterday, and the Nationalist forces again occupied many new positions in the vicinity of Madrid. Under the cover of several air force squadrons, the Nationalist forces' Fourth Column launched an attack on the town of Boadilla del Monte in the northwestern suburbs. At the same time, the government army's attack from the left flank was also repelled by the Nationalist forces. Nationalist aircraft also carried out heavy bombing in the northwestern suburbs of Majadahonda, Pozuelo de Alarcón, and Aravaca, causing many houses to catch fire. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Madrid Nationalist aircraft again heavily bombed the central business district of the capital today, targeting the telephone exchange building. Nationalist artillery first bombarded the building, followed by aircraft bombing.

<h3>Germany's Ultimatum to Spain is Ignored</h3>
<p>Neither Requesting the League of Nations to Intervene, Nor Mentioning the Neutrality Committee</p>
<p>[Geneva] League of Nations personnel declared today that the Spanish government will not be intimidated by Germany's ultimatum. Germany and Spain are currently engaged in an informal naval war, which poses a risk of accidental disputes. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Spanish government sent a note to the League of Nations yesterday, lodging a serious protest against Germany's naval activities in Spanish territorial waters in violation of international law, but did not request the League of Nations to intervene. This note is merely for informational purposes, outlining the recent actions of the German navy in Spanish territorial waters and requesting the League of Nations to convey this matter to all member states. According to the meaning of the note, the Valencia government does not intend to comply with Germany's ultimatum to return the cargo and passengers of the German ship "Palos" by 8:00 AM on Friday, pending investigation by the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee for the Spanish Civil War. According to Spanish sources, there is no reason to submit this case to the Adjustment Committee. (Reuters News Agency, 7th)</p>

<h3>Thousands of Private Individuals in the United States with Annual Salaries Exceeding $15,000</h3>
<p>[Washington] Congress released a list today containing the names of several thousand people whose income exceeded $15,000 last year.

<h3>The Rexist Party of Belgium Propagates its Platform</h3>
<p>Using Italian Radio Stations to Proclaim United Anti-Communism</p>
<p>Brussels After arriving in Italy a few days ago, the leader of the fascist Rexist Party, Léon Degrelle, made a broadcast speech from the Turin radio station today, expounding on the Rexist Party's platform. He stated, "The current barbaric system of Soviet Russia is sufficient to threaten European culture and is the common enemy of the Fascist Party and the Rexist Party. Italy was the first country in Europe to complete the people's revolution, and the Italian farmers and workers have thus regained their true dignity. The Rexist Party of Belgium must strive to restore the people's unity so that they can break away from the rule of bureaucratic politicians and establish a corporatist system." Degrelle's speech was broadcast to this area and was clearly audible. It is generally expected that the Belgian government will protest to Italy because the Belgian government has always prohibited Degrelle from using radio broadcasts to give speeches. Degrelle was unable to achieve his goals in his own country, so he used the Turin radio station instead. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Road Construction Plan</h3>
<p>Warsaw According to reports from Moscow, a plan to build a military road from Moscow to the western border has been decided and will be completed this year. The road is being built by political prisoners and is wide enough to accommodate several vehicles. At the same time, there are branches connecting to the borders of Latvia and Poland. The road is currently 250 kilometers long. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Germany Builds Defensive Works Along the Border with Poland</h3>
<p>Aircraft Prohibited from Flying Overhead to Prevent Leakage of Military Secrets</p>
<p>[Berlin] An official gazette published an order prohibiting all aircraft except German military aircraft from flying over an area of approximately 2,000 square miles in the eastern border area of Prussia near Poland. This order was apparently issued because Polish Foreign Minister Beck announced the continuation of the Franco-Polish alliance in the Polish Parliament yesterday. Germany was deeply irritated by Beck's speech, and especially dissatisfied with the statement, "Now that negotiations for a new Locarno Pact are about to begin, I wish to see our alliance with France maintain its full value." (Reuters News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Aviation Minister General Göring issued an order a few days ago prohibiting aircraft from flying over the area between the Polish border and the right bank of the German Warta River. This area is bounded on the north by the Warthe River (a tributary of the Warta River), on the south by the section of the Warta River between the small towns of Krosno and Ciechocinek, on the west by the straight line between Landsberg an der Warthe and Krosno, and on the east by the Polish border. The above prohibition does not specify a time limit. From now on, all aircraft flying from Germany to Poland should circumvent the south or north of this area. It is reported that the Aviation Ministry's issuance of this prohibition is not a new creation, but it is the first time for a relatively important area. It is generally believed that the German authorities are now building defensive works in the forested and mountainous area between the Warta River and the Polish border, and the prohibition was issued to prevent the leakage of military secrets. Furthermore, the above prohibition was issued on December 30, in other words, the day after Polish Foreign Minister Beck delivered a speech in the Polish Parliament requesting approval of Poland's loan from France. This is also quite noteworthy. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>

<h3>Pope's Illness for Three Weeks, Likely to Succumb</h3>
<p>Vatican City Vatican officials told Associated Press reporters today that Pope Pius XI has been ill for three weeks and is likely to succumb. The Pope has long known this, but he is quite remorseful for failing to complete some important religious affairs. Heart specialists proposed an examination, but the Pope refused. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Vatican City Since the news that the archbishop in charge of convening religious conferences has been invited to reside in or near Rome to prevent the Pope's unexpected passing was released, Catholics are concerned about the Pope's condition. It is generally expected that Cardinal Pacelli, the Secretary of State, has a chance of being elected as the new Pope. Although the Pope was still quiet last night, officials said that his condition has not changed, but the current situation is still precarious. (Reuters News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>The Hague City Hall, Grand Wedding of the Dutch Princess</h3>
<p>After the Rain, the Sky Clears, Making the Scene Even More Lively, Crowds Cheer Wildly Along the Procession Route</p>
<p>The Hague Prince Bernhard and Princess Juliana of the Netherlands held a grand wedding in the Grote Kerk today amidst a joyous atmosphere. After the ceremony, the Queen announced the order to grant the newlywed the title of Prince of the Netherlands. Thirty-three members of the royal families of England, Germany, and other countries attended the ceremony, including the Duke of Kent, the uncle of the British Emperor, and Count Athlone. The streets were full of colored ribbons, making the scene very lively. When the bride and groom rode through the city, cheers resounded like thunder. First, a civil wedding was held at the City Hall, followed by a religious wedding at the church, presided over by Professor Obbink, the chaplain of the inner court. The princess wore an ivory satin dress, and Prince Bernhard wore a blue cavalry lieutenant's uniform. After the religious wedding, the newlywed couple rode back to the palace through the main streets of the capital, a distance of about three miles. The music was melodious, the church bells rang, mixed with the cheers of the people. Although there was a heavy wind and rain yesterday, it suddenly cleared up today, the sky was blue, and no wisps of clouds were visible. In front of the church, tens of thousands of people crowded in early in the morning. Before dawn, troops were deployed along the route. Many people spent the night on the sidewalks in order to occupy a good position in the morning to feast their eyes. (Reuters News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>The Hague Today is the auspicious day for the marriage of Princess Juliana and Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld of the German royal family. The weather is clear and the sun is shining, and the streets of the entire city are decorated with flags and colorful ribbons, dazzlingly beautiful. The wedding procession departed from the palace at 11:00 AM. It was led by several squadrons of cavalry, followed by carriages carrying the groomsmen and bridesmaids. The newlywed couple rode together in a golden carriage drawn by eight magnificent horses. The Prince wore a blue cavalry uniform, and several officers were lined up in five rows behind the carriage to escort them. Soldiers and police were densely deployed along the route, but the crowds surged and their emotions were intense, and there was a risk of breaking through the cordon. When they arrived in front of the City Hall, three bands played music to welcome them. After the civil ceremony was completed, the procession again proceeded to the church for the religious ceremony, and then returned to the palace. The route of the procession was extremely lively. Many people stood in front of the palace, the City Hall, or the church late last night, eager to see the demeanor of the newlywed couple first. It is estimated that no less than a million people attended the ceremony today, which can be described as extremely grand. Since the groom, Prince Bernhard, is the son-in-law of the Queen of the Netherlands, he was bestowed with the prestigious title of "Prince of the Netherlands" and appointed as a member of the Council of State. The bride followed her husband's surname and was called "Princess Lippe-Biesterfeld." (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>The Hague Princess Juliana and Prince Bernhard of Germany held a wedding ceremony in the City Hall today, and then went to the church for a religious ceremony, which was presided over by Dr. Wilde, an elderly priest who is 87 years old. The princess wore a white satin dress, covered with a court gown, with a long train reaching five meters in length. The veil was embroidered with silver roses and crowned with orange blossoms (the national flower of the Netherlands), studded with five diamond-encrusted roses, dazzling and dazzling.

It is reported that the President may discuss this matter with Labor Secretary Perkins. At the same time, the Labor Department also announced that Under Secretary McGrady, before going to San Francisco, had consulted with the employers and suggested that the President appoint a committee of three members to arbitrate all the problems that have not yet been resolved.

<h3>Tianjin Municipal Government Implements Expanded Authority</h3>
<p>Directly Administering Five Land and Water Agencies; The Reason is to Adapt to the Environment</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication The expansion of the Tianjin Municipal Government's powers has been implemented this month. Mayor Zhang Zizhong must still consult with various agencies in Peiping [Beijing] regarding the allocation of funds. The agencies designated by the Hebei-Chahar Political Council to be under the jurisdiction of Tianjin City include: ㊀ Tianjin Garrison Headquarters (formerly under the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Headquarters); ㊁ Hebei Province Five Rivers Water Police Bureau (formerly under the Hebei Provincial Government); ㊂ Hebei Province Maritime Police Bureau (formerly under the Hebei Provincial Government); ㊃ Tianjin District Administrative Commissioner's Office (formerly under the Hebei Provincial Government); ㊄ Tianjin Shipping Bureau (formerly under the Hebei Provincial Government). Among the above five agencies, the Tianjin District Administrative Commissioner's Office originally had jurisdiction over Tianjin and Jinghai counties. Recently, due to the expansion of the municipal government's powers, the jurisdiction has been extended to Ninghe and Wuqing counties. In terms of municipal area, it is impossible to directly incorporate them, so the name of the Tianjin District Administrative Commissioner's Office is used to absorb the two counties and then transfer them to the Tianjin Municipal Government. According to the regulations of the Hebei-Chahar Council, all official documents submitted by the five agencies must follow the usual procedures of requesting the approval of higher-level agencies. That is to say, the procedures of the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Headquarters and the Hebei Provincial Government for the Tianjin Municipal Government to approve or reject the documents have been eliminated. What remains to be discussed at this moment is only the issue of funding. The five agencies spend more than 400,000 yuan per month in total. The Tianjin Garrison Headquarters is paid by the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Headquarters, the Five Rivers Water Police Bureau, the Maritime Police Bureau, the Tianjin District Administrative Commissioner's Office, and the four counties under its jurisdiction (Tianjin, Jinghai, Ninghe, and Wuqing) are paid by the Hebei Provincial Government, and the Tianjin Shipping Bureau retains funds from shipping damage and dock donations. The source of funding for the five agencies has nothing to do with the municipal government. Once they are under its jurisdiction, it is not easy to seek unified payment. Zhang Zizhong indicated in Peiping that it is generally decided that all agencies with original income will directly deduct the funds and submit them to the municipal government, and then the municipal government will allocate them according to the budget. Although the procedures seem slightly complicated, they are much more convenient than transferring funds from the original agencies. Zhang Zizhong will be able to decide on this matter when he returns to Tianjin.</p>
<p>The reason for the expansion of Tianjin's powers this time is said to be partly to adapt to the environment. Because there are more and more foreign affairs in the four counties of Tianjin, Jinghai, Ninghe, and Wuqing, under the pressure of the abnormal foreign forces in North China, it is neither possible for a small county magistrate to deal with them adequately, nor is it possible for an administrative commissioner to take on heavy responsibilities. At the same time, the situation is turbulent, and it is necessary to have meticulous and unified command of security, land, and water defenses. The Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, the Five Rivers Water Police Bureau, and the Maritime Police Bureau are under the jurisdiction of three or several agencies. These three or several agencies are all located far away from Tianjin, and seeking instructions and discussing matters back and forth often leads to delays. The Tianjin Municipal Government has no relationship with the various agencies, so it has no power to dispatch and control them, and it is feared that there will be unexpected accidents, confused steps, and improper responses. Therefore, the Hebei-Chahar authorities, in seeking to adapt to local conditions, have taken this action to expand powers. Not only is Tianjin like this, but the Peiping Municipal Government will also expand its powers to include the Wanping Administrative Commissioner District, with jurisdiction over the administrative and foreign affairs of the four counties of Daxing, Wanping, Qinghe, and Shunyi. It will be implemented in the near future according to the example of Tianjin City. (6th)</p>
<h3>Judgment on the Zhang Yuhua and He Poguang Case of Endangering the Republic of China</h3>
<p>Each Sentenced to Seven Years Imprisonment and Seven Years Deprivation of Civil Rights</p>
<p>The assassination case of former Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan has been concluded after trials by the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court at the Capital District Court. On December 31st of last year, Zhang Yuhua and He Poguang were sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and seven years of deprivation of civil rights each for organizing a group with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China. Four copies of prohibited publications were confiscated. As for the part concerning murder, Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Xiang Zhonglin, Li Huaicheng, and Lu Qingqi were transferred to the Capital District Court due to jurisdictional error. The following is an excerpt of the facts and reasons from the judgment.</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>Zhang Yuhua's thinking leaned to the left. When he served as a section member in the political department of the 25th Division of the National Revolutionary Army, he tried to join the Communist Party but failed. In 1931, he came to Shanghai, where he lived a frustrated life. Through Yan Shaopeng, whom he had known for a long time, he joined the Socialist League, an outer group of the Communist Party (hereinafter referred to as "She Lian"). Under the guidance of the Cultural General League (hereinafter referred to as "Wen Zong"), he participated in gatherings, wrote articles, distributed leaflets, and posted slogans. Later, he was promoted to the District Committee of West Shanghai by the standing committee of She Lian and served as the editor of the She Lian newspaper and a member of the She Lian Economic Committee. Later, he and his friend Hua Ke, who is now at large, came to Nanjing and founded the Chenguang News Agency, after which he no longer held positions in She Lian. He Poguang served as the secretary of the Shanghai Pudong New-Style Laundry Industry Union and the Stevedores' Union. In April 1933, through the introduction of Xie Fensheng, he got to know Zhang Yuhua. First, they organized a reading group, stipulating that they would meet once a week. Later, through Zhang Yuhua's introduction, he joined She Lian and formed a small group with Shen Mingzhao and Zhang Yuhua. Subsequently, he also joined the Workers' Education League (hereinafter referred to as "Gong Jiao Lian"), which was also led by Wen Zong. On September 13th, at Zhang Yuhua's invitation, he came to Nanjing to work as a reporter for the Chenguang News Agency. On the morning of November 1st, 1935, at around 10:00 AM, the Central Party Headquarters held the opening ceremony of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. All the members of the Central Executive Committee stood in front and back rows in front of the conference hall to take a group photo. After the photo was taken, the members of the Central Executive Committee in the back row turned and entered the conference hall. Wang Jingwei, the former Premier of the Executive Yuan, happened to be in the front row. At that time, Sun Fengming, who had entered the venue under the name of a reporter for the Chenguang News Agency, suddenly stepped out from the crowd next to the camera and fired three shots at Premier Wang with a gun. Fortunately, they were not fatal. Sun Fengming was apprehended on the spot and was fatally shot by a police officer. He died the next day. The defendants Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Xiang Zhonglin, Li Huaicheng, and Lu Qingqi were all suspected of participating in the assassination and were arrested one after another in Shanghai, Danyang, Zhenjiang, and other places. They were sent by the Capital Police Department to the Military Police Command. With the resolution of the Central Standing Committee, they were transferred to the court for handling. After the prosecutor of this court concluded the investigation, he charged Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Xiang Zhonglin, Li Huaicheng, and Lu Qingqi with jointly violating Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China, and Article 271, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law. According to Article 55 of the Criminal Law, they should be punished according to the more severe offense. Zhang Yuhua had joined She Lian and served as a district committee member, and He Poguang had joined She Lian and Gong Jiao Lian, and had also violated Article 6 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China. A public prosecution was filed with the court.</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>This case is divided into two parts for discussion as follows:</p>
<p>[A. The part where Zhang Yuhua and He Poguang are accused of organizing a group with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China. It has been found that the defendant Zhang Yuhua confessed during the investigation, "After the January 28th Incident, I was introduced by Yan to join She Lian, served as the District Committee of West Shanghai, and was guided by Wen Zong. Wen Zong is an outer group of the Communist Party and is guided by the Communist Party." (See page 412 of the investigation file of the Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor). In his confession to the Nanjing Garrison Command, he described in detail the reasons for participating in She Lian's activities, the content of She Lian's organization, and the work he held in She Lian (see pages 10 to 13 of Zhang Yuhua's confession). Now he argues that She Lian is an abbreviation for the Social Science League, not the Socialist League, and is a group that studies social sciences. The Three Principles of the People are also included in the research. It has no reactionary nature at all. The group is not a Communist group, and its members are not Communist Party members, etc. This is obviously an attempt to justify himself and cannot be believed. As for the defendant He Poguang, he organized a reading group with Xie Fensheng and Zhang Yuhua in Shanghai in February and March of 1934. Later, he was introduced by Zhang Yuhua to join She Lian. He not only confessed repeatedly during the investigation by the Garrison Command and the prosecutor, but also admitted it without hesitation during the trial in this court (see the trial record of this court on March 31, 1936). In his confession, he even stated that in July 1934, through Zhang Yuhua's relationship, he joined the Socialist League and formed a small group with Shen Mingjian and Zhang Yuhua to specialize in theoretical research. There were also printed materials such as "A Letter to Workers on Revolutionary Memorial Day," "She Lian Work Report," and "Current Affairs Commentary," which were brought for distribution. In August, the New-Style Laundry Industry Union was closed down, so I moved to Pudong and joined the Workers' Education League. I was close to Chen Wangzhi, a member of the standing committee of Wen Zong, and considered launching a labor-capital struggle for laundry workers, but it failed to develop due to the death of the workers' leader Xu Benliang, etc. (see page 7 of He Poguang's confession). Now he says that he does not know what kind of nature She Lian belongs to, only knowing that it is a reading organization. His empty words are overturned and cannot be adopted. Furthermore, the content of She Lian's organization, according to Zhang Yuhua's confession, is "to participate in all groups in action and use opportunities to launch struggles to win over their own masses; in propaganda, to break into all publications to publish texts that are beneficial to them." It can be seen that the main purpose of this group is to seize the masses for the Communist Party in order to launch class struggles and to hope to transform the country of the Three Principles of the People into a Communist country. Therefore, Zhang Yuhua and others' participation in She Lian's activities is to organize a group for the purpose of endangering the Republic of China, which is undoubtedly true. Although He Poguang was arrested because of Sun Fengming's assassination of Premier Wang, he described the process of joining She Lian during the interrogation, but there was no expression of intention to seek judgment, which does not meet the requirements of surrender. As for Zhang Yuhua's arrest, it was after He Poguang's arrest. The fact that he and He Poguang jointly joined She Lian had already been stated by He Poguang, so his confession of joining She Lian cannot be regarded as surrender, let alone said. It is also claimed that after they arrived at the Chenguang News Agency, they broke away from She Lian, but since they did not legally surrender, it is difficult to reduce or exempt them from criminal liability. Furthermore, both Zhang Yuhua and He Poguang served in propaganda work that was beneficial to the Communist Party after joining She Lian and Gong Jiao Lian, as has been stated in the record. In addition to committing the crime of organizing a group for the purpose of endangering the Republic of China, they also committed the crime of propagating doctrines that are incompatible with the Three Principles of the People. However, it has been found that although there are three types of acts in Article 6 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China, they are legal provisions that coincide and should be punished according to the more serious crime of organizing a group for the purpose of endangering the Republic of China. In accordance with Articles 6 and 10 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China, Article 28, Section 37, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, they are each sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and seven years of deprivation of civil rights. The books seized in the case have been reviewed by the Central Organization Department. The two books "Left-Wing Infantile Disorder" and "The Current Situation of World Labor" are Communist publications. The book "On the State" and other books are anarchist publications. The book "Communism and China" is a publication of the State-Faction Youth Party. All of them are reactionary books that should be banned. Even if it cannot be proven who owns them, since they are prohibited items, they should be confiscated in accordance with Article 38, Paragraph 1, Item 1 and Article 40 of the Criminal Law.

<p>Approved New Tax Rate for Land Tax</p>
<p>The revision of the land tax regulations has been drafted by the county and submitted to the authorities. The original regulations have been merged and revised into three classes and nine grades, which have already been reported to the bureau. Now, according to the instructions, the new tax rates have been examined, and amendments have been made to test them for one year. The tax rates for each grade are listed below: First class, upper grade: 1.6 yuan per mu of arable land; middle grade: 1.3 yuan per mu; lower grade: 1.1 yuan per mu. Second class, upper grade: 0.83 yuan per mu; middle grade: 0.68 yuan per mu; lower grade: 0.64 yuan per mu. Third class, upper grade: 0.5 yuan per mu; middle grade: 0.41 yuan per mu; lower grade: 0.22 yuan per mu. The above new tax rates are based on the lowest tax rate of each old regulation in the new regulations as the standard tax rate, and are appropriately reduced. All arrears of taxes were previously pursued by the Qingfu Committee sent by the bureau, and a deadline of the 5th of this month was set to pay them off uniformly. The deadline has expired, and very few have completed the payment. From now on, they will be pursued and押缴户 by户 in order to maintain national taxes.</p>

He has organized work relief, controlled Linghe, eliminated locusts, and assisted in dismantling the enclosure of lake fields in East Taihu, earning a good reputation for his administration. Recently, he was transferred by the county magistrate to Mudu District to develop his talents. District Chief Jin once studied in Mudu and taught there for many years, so the district is like his second hometown. Several dozen fellow villagers from Mudu who are living in Shanghai, including Wang Changlie, Ding Zhongyu, and Feng Rongchang, have telegraphed to welcome him to take office soon.</p>
<p>Headless Murder Case in Xukou Township</p>
<p>The Procuratorate of the Wuxian County District Court received a report from Zhao Ashuang, the local security officer of Xukou Township, stating that an unidentified male corpse, about thirty years old, was found murdered on the river beach of Xiaojing, Shajin Bridge, on the bank of West Taihu. The hands were tied with hemp rope. He requested that personnel be sent to examine the corpse to clarify the truth. The office dispatched Prosecutor Zhou to the township on the 7th, accompanied by clerks and police officers, to examine the corpse by boat. The examination confirmed that he had been murdered and the corpse had been abandoned in the river. The local security officer was ordered to collect the body. Prosecutor Zhou and others returned to the city in the evening and strictly arrested the murderers for investigation.</p>

<p>End of the Aid-Sui Entertainment Fair</p>
<p>After holding a New Year's Day celebration for three days, all sectors here continued to hold the Aid-Sui Entertainment Fair on the 5th and 6th. The performances included Peking Opera. Tickets were sold for six jiao for daytime sessions and one yuan for nighttime sessions. All proceeds, after deducting expenses, were remitted to be used as aid for Sui. In addition to some local amateur performers, Jiang Wanqing, who is known as the Mei Lanfang of Jiangyin, and Xu Xiafei were hired to perform in Changshu. According to statistics, the ticket income for the two days was about 2,700 yuan, but after deducting expenses, only about 1,000 yuan remained.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Raiding a Monk's Secret Chamber</p>
<p>Zhongdushan in the third district of the county is one of the scenic areas of this county. There is a Niangniang Temple on the mountain, which is very popular on weekdays. The common people flock to it like ducks to water. The abbot of the temple, Monk Hongyuan (aka Hongyuan), did not abide by the monastic rules and often came to the city, indulging in pleasure. There was also an opium couch in the temple for people to smoke privately, and a secret chamber was opened to be a golden house for hiding a lover. On November 27th of last year, Tan Gujin, a police officer from the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau under its jurisdiction, together with Song Jingren, the squad leader of the militia team, went to search and arrest the perpetrators. Many opium smoking utensils were seized on the spot. At that time, a young woman named Chen Li (said to be the concubine of a merchant in Shanghai) was lying in the room and claimed to be a pilgrim. The police officers brought the smoking utensils to the bureau and submitted them to the General Bureau, which then forwarded them to the county government. County Magistrate Long instructed the Public Security Bureau to summon all the witnesses to the county government for thorough investigation, because the inside story of the case was unclear. Director Zhang then ordered Director He Chaoan of the Sixth Branch to comply. On the 6th, Director He had summoned Monk Hongyuan, the woman Chen Li, and Zhang Chaoxuan to be presented to the General Bureau and forwarded to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<p>The Weather Turns Cold and Snows Again</p>
<p>Since the beginning of winter, the weather has been dry, and the temperature has been uneven, resulting in abnormal plants. In the fields of Yu Jinhui's home in Fuzhou Village, Qibao Township, Ninth District, winter wheat has flowered and fruited, which is rare in the world. Children in urban and rural areas are prone to diseases. The weather was warm a few days ago, as if it were spring. However, on the morning of the 7th, it suddenly turned cold again. The Fahrenheit thermometer dropped to 38 degrees. The sky was covered with floating clouds, and snowflakes fluttered in the sky at 1:00 PM, melting as soon as they hit the ground. It did not stop until the evening. In total, there have been three snowfalls in Wuxi, and the farmers rejoiced.</p>
<p>Conscription of Labor for Road Construction in Townships</p>
<p>Zhu Lu, the chief of the Fourth District, stated that the township roads in the district were severely damaged and urgently needed to be repaired. The width of the road surface of the Fuxi Trunk Road was stipulated to be four meters. The width of Zhangtan Road, Zhangxin Road, Xinlu Road, Yangwan Road, Lujiang Road, Jingtang Road, Yingsheng Road, Tanlu Road, Tanxi Road, Oufu Road, and Xinxiu Road was stipulated to be three meters. Therefore, during the agricultural slack season, labor was conscripted for construction. Yesterday, the county government issued a notice to inform the residents near each road, so that they should not deliberately obstruct or make excuses, or they will be punished.</p>

<h3>Telegrams from Two Railway Unions</h3>
<p>Supporting the Central Government's Handling of the Aftermath of the Shaanxi Incident</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Unions sent the following two telegrams to the central government and Zhang Xueliang yesterday: ㊀ "To the Central Party Headquarters (National Government) in Nanjing, greetings. The Xi'an Incident has caused outrage throughout the country and shocked the world. Fortunately, due to the great personality of our leader, the stubborn and rebellious have obeyed, and weapons have turned into jade. Great calamities have led to auspicious harmony. Our joy and excitement cannot be expressed in words. Upon reading the newspaper, we learned that the central government, in dealing with the case, has granted a special pardon outside of the sentence, and handed him over to the Military Affairs Commission for strict supervision in order to atone for his crimes. We can see that while rectifying discipline, the central government is also giving those who repent a path to self-renewal. Although the people of the whole country feel that there are still some regrets, they can still be forgiven. However, we still ask the central government to strictly restrain Zhang Xueliang's actions in the future in order to correct his thinking and break the delusion of his feudal tribe, so that he sincerely obeys the central government and supports the leader. All Northeast troops should also be strictly trained and not be incited by reactionary elements. As for the management of military expenditures, it should be directly disbursed by the military in order to eliminate the previous contracting system, so that all the country's troops are the country's troops and cannot establish a separate system to avoid disrupting discipline. We humbly submit this opinion and ask for your consideration. Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Unions, bowed respectfully. Yang." ㊁ "To Mr. Zhang Hanqing, greetings from Nanjing. In the Xi'an Incident, due to a moment of error, you almost plunged the nation into an abyss of destruction. Fortunately, our leader has a great personality, and the central government has handled the matter appropriately. You were able to pull back from the brink, bravely and thoroughly realize your mistake, and turn weapons into jade and anger into harmony. The past is like yesterday's death, and the future is like today's birth. We hope that you will appreciate the central government's extraordinary generosity and atone for your sins. Sincerely obey the supervision of the Military Affairs Commission, and please inform your comrades on the front lines to invigorate the righteousness, recognize the nation, and eliminate the previous feudal habits. Do not be incited by reactionary elements, follow the principles of our party, and support the leader. All military affairs, military orders, military expenditures, and military education should be completely obeyed by the central government, so that the national army can become a powerful force and complete the great task of national rejuvenation. This will not fail the expectations of the central government, the chairman, and the people of the whole country. We look forward to your observation. Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Unions, bowed respectfully. Yang."</p>
<h3>The Silver and Money Industries Associations Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing Income Tax Withholding Procedures, etc. A Decision Will Be Made After Contacting the Office</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance announced that the income tax would continue to be levied from New Year's Day, the Silver and Money Industries Associations decided to comply and submitted the opinions of the income tax research small group on the deposit portion to the Ministry for consideration, hoping to be adopted. As for the withholding procedures and income tax on dividends and public accumulation funds, it was decided to discuss them further. The Banking Association held its 20th Executive Committee meeting at its office on Hong Kong Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. Committee members Chen Guangfu, Li Fuxun, Zhuang Dezhi, Wang Boyuan, Hu Xian, Wu Weiru, Pan Jiufen (represented by Cheng Muhao), Zhang Peishen, Song Ziliang (represented by Zhang Zhuyu), and representatives of the Money Industry Association Pei Yunqing and Feng Yigui were invited to participate.

<p>Italian Ambassador to China, Aloisi, has already been appointed as the Ambassador to Brazil.

<h3>Ministry of Communications Urges Private Shipping Companies to Register Speedily</h3>
<p>In order to conduct the registration of private shipping businesses, promote cooperation, and avoid independent actions, in addition to promulgating the registration rules, the Ministry of Communications has issued a petition form to the Maritime Affairs Bureau to inform the various shipping companies to register speedily within a short period. The Maritime Affairs Bureau's instruction is recorded as follows: "According to the instruction No. 4867 of the Ministry of Communications on December 25 of this year, 'It is found that due to the failure to conduct registration of private shipping businesses in our country, supervision is extremely difficult. In recent years, due to the impact of domestic and foreign economic insecurity, the shipping business has been deteriorating. In addition, shipping companies are acting independently and failing to cooperate effectively, while general unofficial shipping companies are engaged in speculation and disruption, making it impossible to restrict them. As a result, route disputes are occurring repeatedly, and shipping companies are often resorting to price cuts to compete, ultimately leading to mutually destructive outcomes. This situation is a major obstacle to the future of the shipping industry. In order to seek ways to implement registration for private shipping businesses, so as to supervise and promote national shipping cooperation, the Ministry has formulated the 'Shipping Business Registration Rules', 'Shipping Business Supervision Regulations', and 'Measures for Promoting Shipping Cooperation,' which were promulgated simultaneously on the 9th of this month with ministerial orders. In addition to petitioning the Executive Yuan for record and issuing separate orders, these rules, regulations, measures, and petition forms have been compiled and issued, so that you may be informed, and you are instructed to inform your subordinate offices and shipping trade associations, this order,' etc. attached are the 'Shipping Business Registration Rules', 'Shipping Business Supervision Regulations', 'Measures for Promoting Shipping Cooperation', and the 'Shipping Business Establishment Registration Petition Form', and 'Supplementary Registration Petition Form'. Upon receiving this, in addition to issuing separate orders, the corresponding 'Shipping Business Registration Rules', 'Shipping Business Supervision Regulations', and 'Measures for Promoting Shipping Cooperation' are enclosed for your information, and you are instructed to inform your subordinates accordingly, this order (below omitted)."</p>

<h3>Salt Revenue Auditing Office Develops Salt Affairs on the Anhui Shore</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, in recent years, the Salt Revenue Auditing Office of the Ministry of Finance has achieved significant results in the reform of salt administration and the rectification of salt taxes in various regions. According to the announcement of the office regarding the organization of salt affairs on the Anhui shore, the following is an abstract for the information of those concerned. The Anhui shore is one of the four major sales shores of Huai salt (Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Anhui), with an annual salt tax revenue of more than six million yuan. Its geographical scope is within Anhui Province, excluding the nineteen counties in northern Anhui under the jurisdiction of the Bengbu Tax Collection Office, and Tianchang County, which is also under the jurisdiction of the Lianghuai salt region. The remaining seven counties in northern Anhui, including Hefei, and the entire southern Anhui region are managed by the Tax and Transportation Bureau, which manages salt administrative affairs. The Audit Office for Anhui Shore is responsible for auditing, tax collection, weighing, and distribution. In recent years, the financial authorities have been eager to unify powers and improve efficiency, so they ordered the Director of the Audit Office to concurrently manage the affairs of the Tax and Transportation Bureau. In recent years, it has achieved considerable results in increasing revenue, eliminating abuses, and facilitating the people.</p>
<p>Establishment of Central General Warehouse in Wuhu Planned</p>
<p>The salt in various parts of Anhui shore is transported from the Twelve Forts of the Huai region and distributed by sailboats. After arrival, taxes are paid before sales can begin. In order to concentrate the salt, facilitate management and distribution, and prepare for the implementation of the new salt law, land has been purchased on the Jiangnan (Yangtze River) shore in Wuhu to plan for the establishment of a central general warehouse. The plan is that after the completion of this general warehouse, all salt transported to the shore will first be concentrated and stored, and then distributed according to the needs of each branch shore and the means of transportation. In this way, merchants can safely store their goods without worrying about losses, and the government can prevent smuggling and increase official sales. The plan for this warehouse has been finalized and construction can begin in the near future.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Huai Salt Branch in Anqing</p>
<p>The salt consumed in the seven counties of Huaining (Anqing) and Taihu in the upper reaches of the Anhui shore has traditionally been supplied by Datong. People have to travel long distances to purchase it, which not only increases transportation costs, but also requires a handling fee of five cents per dan to the transport salt company, which is neither fair nor convenient. Therefore, the Audit Office specially obtained approval to establish a Huai Salt Branch in Anqing, and instructed salt merchants to directly transport salt from the production area for storage. The price of salt will be the same as that of Datong. It is recently heard that the branch can sell up to 100 tickets of salt per year.</p>
<p>Improve Transportation and Reduce Transportation Costs</p>
<p>The salt on Anhui shore has traditionally been transported by sailboat, and its transshipment to various branch shores requires changing to smaller boats for river transport due to the shallow water level in the inland rivers. The transshipment is costly and difficult, and often leads to unsalability. Merchants pass on the transshipment costs to the price of salt, further increasing the burden on the people. In recent years, the authorities have been aware of this and instructed merchants to use modern transportation tools as much as possible. At present, the salt used in Yicheng, Qingyang, Shidi, Taiping, and other counties is transported by road and automobile. Salt from the riverbank to Hefei is transported by train on the Huainan Railway, which not only reduces the risk, but also saves costs and time.</p>
<p>Reduce Tax Rates to Prevent Private Sales</p>
<p>The tax rate on Huai salt on the Anhui shore is higher than that of neighboring provinces, except for a portion of the sales area bordering Jiangxi. Neighboring salt is constantly encroaching on sales, which is a constant occurrence. Therefore, the salt tax in Taihu, Hexian, Dangtu, Shidi, Taiping, Jingde, and other counties has recently been reduced by one yuan per dan, so as to be roughly the same as that of Kunshan and other places. At the same time, the number of tax police has been adjusted to prevent it. Both samples and measures have been implemented, with considerable results. For example, Taihu County, which has been deprived of sales by the low-tax areas in previous years, has almost no market. Recently, it can sell more than a thousand dan per month. After tax reduction and anti-smuggling in Taiping and Shidi counties, transportation has been improved, thereby reducing costs and increasing sales volume.</p>
<p>Suppressing Boat Households and Improving Salt Quality</p>
<p>The quality of edible salt on the Anhui shore is quite poor, the reason being that all salt is transported from the Twelve Forts, where the quality and color of the stored salt are inferior. In addition, the sailboat transportation is slow, and boatmen sprinkle and sell along the way, often adding water to make up for the shortage. Therefore, once the salt arrives ashore, the amount of brine lost is very large, and the quality of the salt is even worse. Recently, the authorities have supervised the Food Salt Review Office of the Xiliang Customs to extract salt samples for testing when salt boats pass through the customs. Those that do not meet the standard composition will not be certified for release. On the one hand, each weighing and distribution office is instructed to pay attention. If there is dirty salt, it will be ordered to be destroyed. Wet salt will be instructed to filter the brine and dry it before it can be weighed and stored. Color matching is not allowed to reduce the net weight of the salt. After repeated strict rectifications, the above-mentioned malpractices have gradually been reduced, and the quality of the salt has been improved.</p>
<h3>China Merchants and Six Other Companies Collect Shallow Water Fees on the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Forty Percent, to be Implemented on the 15th</p>
<p>The China Merchants, Sanbei, NingShao, Taikoo Jardine, Nissin, and other six companies decided through a joint meeting to collect shallow water fees on the Yangtze River. Their announcement stated: "From January 15, 1937, all goods loaded to ports above Wuhu (including Hankou) must add shallow water fees, collected at 40% of the water power. This is hereby announced."</p>
<h3>Shipping Agents and Other Associations Oppose Weighing for Calculation</h3>
<p>Request the Six Companies to Withdraw the Decision</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (state-owned), Sanbei Shipping Company (private), Ningshao, Jardine Matheson (British), Taikoo (British), Nissin (Japanese) and other six companies have jointly decided to calculate Yangtze River freight charges by weight. The Shanghai Shipping Agents Association and the Shanghai Regional Merchant Associations have unanimously opposed the decision and requested that the previous method of calculating freight charges based on the customs-taxed weight be retained. After repeated negotiations between the two parties proved futile, the two associations convened a members' meeting and resolved to notify the six companies yesterday: "To the esteemed companies, regarding the proposed weighing of goods transported to various ports along the Yangtze River by Pingzhun Company, your companies have previously called upon our associations to nominate representatives to discuss the matter together. After separate meetings with members from the Yangtze River region and joint meetings, all concluded that calculating freight charges based on the customs-taxed weight has been a long-standing practice and is convenient for all parties, without causing any undue advantage or disadvantage. As such, it would be difficult to comply with the proposed weighing by Pingzhun Company, and this has been duly recorded. Our associations have worked with your esteemed companies directly or indirectly for many years and have enjoyed a long-standing harmonious relationship. Should the goods be weighed by Pingzhun Company, it would only add unnecessary procedures and inevitably lead to pointless disputes, harming the friendly relationship between us. Therefore, we are writing to convey the situation and respectfully request that you accommodate the wishes of our members, withdraw the decision, and continue to operate as before. We would be most grateful for your consideration. Sincerely, to the Six Yangtze River Shipping Companies."</p>
<h3>Women's Welfare Association Receives Aid Supplies for Suiyuan</h3>

<h3>Banking Association Studies Special Cash Guarantee Measures</h3>
<p>Considered Meticulously Planned and Feasible</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Shanghai, a major bank in the city, noting the repeated cases of embezzlement and misappropriation by bank employees in recent years, and considering the current guarantor system to be ineffective in providing guarantees, has proposed special cash guarantee measures to improve the guarantee system. News of this initiative has been reported in the press. It is now understood that the measures have undergone two years of research and supplementation, and various sectors believe that the guarantor system is rife with abuses and should undoubtedly be abolished. There is a strong hope that it will be implemented soon to alleviate the difficulties faced by bank employees, guarantors, and other parties. Recently, the Shanghai Banking Association received a letter from the Ministry of Industry, requesting a thorough study of the measures to ensure their perfection. The Banking Association requested a detailed study by the Banking Institute. All agreed that the guarantee system urgently needs to be improved. However, the credit insurance methods currently practiced in Europe and the United States are too expensive, unsuitable for China, difficult to implement, and lack active measures to prevent fraud in advance. The special cash guarantee measures are based on the principles of credit insurance while adapting to the social conditions of China. The combined effect of the various regulations ensures both security for the bank and improvement of personnel management, implementation of employee welfare programs, and cultivation of employees' intellectual, moral, physical, and communal values. It also provides for joint penalties and rewards for reporting misconduct to curb the motivation for fraud. The amount of the security deposit is small and easily affordable, and it is treated as personal savings for the employee, to be fully refunded upon departure from the bank. This combines insurance with savings and is considered to be in line with the trends of the times and practically feasible. The Banking Institute also believed that the matter was of great importance to the financial community and its practitioners nationwide and sent the measures to financial professionals and companies nationwide for research and comment. The responses received have been overwhelmingly positive, praising the meticulous planning and calling for its immediate implementation. It is now understood that the Banking Institute will send the research results and a summary of the comments to the Banking Association, hoping that all banks will adopt it. It is recently reported that the Shanghai Banking Association attaches great importance to this issue. At the recent 11th Annual Members' Meeting, Chairman Chen Guangfu reported on the proposal to abolish the current bank guarantee system and resolved to promote the special cash guarantee measures, instructing branch associations in various locations to conduct research on the topic.</p>

<h3>Labor Strike Erupts Among Female Workers in the Spinning Department of the Shenxin No. 8 Factory Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Work Briefly Resumed After Party and Government Officials Mediated, but Conflicts Erupted Again in the Night Shift, Threatening Escalation of Labor Unrest</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, over 600 workers in the spinning department of the Shenxin Textile Company's No. 8 Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, Western Shanghai, initiated a labor strike starting at 6:00 AM yesterday. Following mediation and persuasion by officials from the Party and government organs, the strike was briefly resolved, and workers resumed work at noon. However, conflicts erupted again after the night shift began, and both the spinning and fine spinning departments are completely idle. The local police station dispatched personnel to quell the unrest, and the labor strike is threatening to escalate. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Causes of the Labor Strike</p>
<p>The Shenxin Textile Company's factories No. 1 and No. 8, as well as the weaving mill, are located in the Zhoujiaqiao area of Western Shanghai, employing over 6,000 male and female workers. Recently, the workers discovered that the factory was underpaying wages, which they believed was intentional deduction. They requested that the factory record the daily wage amount on the work booklet daily (the factory's wages are calculated by piece rate) for verification and to avoid errors. However, the factory has not implemented this request, leading to worker dissatisfaction and fueling the labor strike.</p>
<p>Strike Action Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>At 6:00 AM yesterday, as the night shift ended and the day shift workers entered the factory, the factory management staff failed to open the factory doors of the spinning department, preventing workers from leaving the factory and those on the day shift from entering. This misunderstanding led to the labor strike. Over 600 female workers in the fine spinning department stopped working, followed by over 400 workers in the coarse spinning department, who also announced a strike. As for the other departments, factory No. 1, and the weaving mill, the over 5,000 workers continued to work as usual, unaffected by the strike. The striking workers also presented six demands to the factory, including rewards for work. After this incident occurred, the District Ten Cotton Spinning Workers' Union, fearing the escalation of the labor strike, dispatched personnel to persuade the workers to maintain order and sent representatives to report to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting them to seek a resolution.</p>
<p>Mediation and Resumption of Work</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Municipal Party Headquarters immediately dispatched Lu Yinchu, a cadre from the Civil Affairs Department, to the factory at around 9:00 AM to investigate the truth and persuade the workers to resume work first. The workers immediately complied and resumed work, but then restarted the strike. Subsequently, Zhu Jintao, a representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, also arrived at the factory and, together with the factory director Wang Yuncheng, Hua Weiren, representatives Hua Jianren and Li Xintang, and worker representatives Wen Renliang, Liu Shibao, and Chen Cailin, mediated and decided on the following measures: (1) Starting from February 1st, all wages will be clearly recorded in the work booklets; (2) The fine spinning department's worship work shall not exceed 9:00 AM the following morning; (3) Those who are idled due to the strike should be assigned work as soon as possible to avoid long waits; (4) The floor-sweeping work in the spinning department will be funded by the factory, and the workers will sweep the small alleys themselves. The workers deemed the measures satisfactory and resumed work at noon.</p>
<p>Renewed Conflict</p>
<p>After the workers resumed work, the conflict had initially come to an end. However, at around 7:00 PM yesterday, after the night shift workers entered the factory, the female workers in the night shift fine spinning department suddenly went on strike again and rushed into the spinning department, throwing objects at the workers who were working, causing the spinning department workers to be unable to work as well and to stop working. The factory was deeply concerned that accidents might occur due to the chaotic situation and immediately called the Zhoujiaqiao police station to dispatch over 30 police officers to the scene to quell the unrest. However, the workers still gathered in the factory, and the situation was quite serious, threatening the escalation of the labor unrest.</p>

<h3>Last Year's Financial Stability Improved Shanghai Real Estate</h3>
<p>Hopes for Gradual Recovery and Prosperity</p>
<p>According to the New News Agency, Shanghai's land prices were quite prosperous before the January 28th Shanghai Incident. In recent years, due to the impact of political instability and the global economic downturn, market prices plummeted. According to real estate developers speaking to New News Agency reporters, in the past two to three years, various businesses in Shanghai have reduced their scale and cut expenses due to the market slump. This has led to an increase in vacant houses and numerous empty properties on various roads. Although landlords have voluntarily reduced rents to remedy the situation, real estate valuations remain high and taxes have not decreased. The local real estate association has petitioned the municipal authorities to reduce valuations and provide relief. Recalling the past when the national financial situation was active and real estate transactions were flourishing, the current lifeless state is vastly different. Fortunately, since the implementation of the legal tender policy in our country, the national currency system has been unified and the financial foundation has been consolidated. The national economy has transitioned from decline to recovery. In particular, last year's bumper harvests across the country have invigorated the rural economy, and real estate transactions have improved, marking a sign of the revival of our national economy. It is expected that all industries will recover and prosper in the future, and the real estate industry will gradually restore its vitality, revitalizing the Shanghai market.</p>

<h3>Shanghai West Opens Qinghu Road</h3>
<p>Operating Long-Distance Buses</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Qingpu Long-Distance Bus Company, recognizing that the airport station is far from Shanghai and that vehicles on the Hongqiao Road cannot directly reach Shanghai, causing inconvenience to passengers, jointly decided with the Shanghai-Minhang Company this autumn to build a road starting from Huangjia Garden in Caohejing Town in Shanghai West, passing through Jiangjia Village to the west, to Qibao Town, crossing the Puhuitang Port and turning north, directly to Wujiaxiang Town at the western end of the airport, connecting to Qinghu Road. This allows long-distance buses from Qingpu to directly reach Guohuo Road in Nanshi. The Shanghai-Minhang Company has submitted applications to the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Construction Department and the Shanghai Municipal Government for approval. The Public Works Bureau has dispatched personnel to survey the area and determine the route. Construction will begin as soon as the Bureau Affairs Meeting approves it. The required funds will be raised by the company.</p>
<h3>Suzhou River Low Tide Blocks Boat Traffic</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon after 3:00 PM, the Wusong River (commonly known as the Suzhou River) experienced low tide, and the number of boats traveling back and forth was high, causing traffic to be blocked. From Tanzikou and Chadaikou in the west, passing Hengfeng Road Bridge, Xinzha Bridge, Wuzhen Road Bridge, New Garbage Bridge, Old Garbage Bridge, Pentanglong Bridge, Tianhougong Bridge, Tap Water Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, to Waibaidu Bridge, a stretch of about five to six li of the river surface was congested with no less than five to six thousand boats, making it impossible for water to pass through. Small tugboats carrying cargo ships such as Hexing, Changxin, and Anji were all docked at the Second Squadron of the Water Patrol, which urgently dispatched small patrol boats to clear the sections. The traffic was not cleared until late at night.</p>

<h3>Xi E Hears Lawsuit for Disregarding Land Rent</h3>
<p>Original Accused are Family Friends; Lawyer Requests Reconciliation</p>
<p>Xi E Han, a 53-year-old Jiangyin native and wealthy merchant of pigments and real estate residing at No. 1051 Jing'an Temple Road, entrusted lawyer Jiang Yiping to represent him and filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Special Court against Wang Zhulin (55 years old, Wuxi native), Wang Guidong (40 years old, Sichuan native, residing at No. 3 Weixiang Yuli, Catholic Church), and Xi Chenggen (48 years old, Jiangyin native, residing at No. 208 Hede Road), all shareholders of Jiuyuan Real Estate Company, for disregarding land rent of 23,216.09 yuan, requesting a joint and several judgment for repayment. According to the statement, the plaintiff owns a piece of land located at No. 137 on the French register of deeds at the East Xinqiao pier of Edward Road, which was leased to Jiuyuan Real Estate Company to build houses along the road, open the Da Hu Hotel, and build market houses on both sides. At that time, the annual rent was set at 13,400 taels. However, from September 13, 1935, to March 13, 1936, rent arrears amounted to 23,216 yuan. After more than two months of unsuccessful reconciliation between the two parties, the plaintiff sued for a joint and several judgment against the three defendants. The court granted the request, and yesterday morning, Judge Ma Yishu visited the Civil Court No. 7 to summon the defendants. The plaintiff, represented by lawyer Jiang, stated the meaning of the prosecution and the object of the judgment. The first and third defendants, Wang Zhulin and Xi Chenggen, delegated lawyers to argue that the plaintiff and defendants had been family friends for many years and were relatives, requesting permission for a postponement to allow the two parties to reconcile outside the court. The second defendant, Wang Guidong, delegated lawyer Wu Zhiping to argue that Wang Guidong had published a statement in the newspaper on April 4, 1936, declaring his withdrawal as a shareholder of Jiuyuan Real Estate Company, and there were corresponding letters, which could prove this. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that he did not recognize the second defendant's claim, but he must also be jointly and severally responsible for repaying the rent arrears. Now that the defendants have proposed reconciliation and payment in installments, the plaintiff can agree, but the amount cannot be reduced. After the court verified the statements, it announced that the hearing would be postponed to the 14th. The court then adjourned.</p>

<h3>Wife Comes to Shanghai and Remarries, Found Only After Twelve Years</h3>
<p>Cannot Be Taken Back, Sues in Court for Obstructing Family; Defendant Not Present at Yesterday's Trial, Summoned Again for Postponement</p>
<p>Ye Shenglin, a 37-year-old Taoist priest from Zhintang, Taicang, married a fellow villager, Ba Ruibao, ten years ago and had two sons. In 1924, Ba Ruibao falsely claimed to be working as a servant in Shanghai and remarried Zhou Zhaozhang, the owner of the Jincheng cattle shed on Xietu Road, Fenglin Bridge. It has been twelve years since then. Ye Shenglin has now found her in Shanghai. After being blocked from taking her back, Ye discovered that his wife, Ba Ruibao, had met Zhou through Tang Jinfu, a fellow villager, who received a reward. Tang opened a matchmaker shop called Jin Laojian Tou at No. 149 Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession. Ye negotiated with Jin, but to no avail. Therefore, Ye Shenglin hired a lawyer to represent him and filed a lawsuit in the criminal court of the Second Special Court, accusing Tang Jinfu and others of obstructing the family and requesting legal investigation. Based on the statement, the court summoned the defendants to the Criminal Court No. 2 yesterday afternoon, with Judge Wang Gangxu presiding. The defendants were not present. The plaintiff, Ye Shenglin, stated the previous situation and said that after his wife fled to Shanghai, he did not know her whereabouts until Ba Ruibao sent a letter to her mother from Shanghai in mid-October last year, which was read by her cousin, Ba Yinsheng, who informed the people and accompanied his friend He Hongchu to Shanghai to find her. It happened that Ba Ruibao and Zhou Zhaozhang returned to Ningbo to build graves and had not yet returned to Shanghai. More than a month later, they went to look for her again and finally met her. At that time, Ruibao refused to go home with him, so they struggled with each other to the British Concession police station. Ruibao then agreed to go home with the people, so the headman ordered the people to take her back. At that time, the people led Ruibao to Hongxiang Hotel in the British Concession for one night. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the defendant Tang Jinfu arrived and forcibly took his wife Ruibao away, claiming that Zhou Zhaozhang was willing to pay 200 yuan and asked to collect the money from the Xiayi Society. Later, the people did not dare to argue with them because they were unfamiliar with the place, and let them take Ruibao away. Later, they repeatedly went to look for her, but they were all hidden and could not be seen. Therefore, they had no choice but to file a lawsuit and request legal action. The witnesses Ba Yinnan and He Hongchu successively proved the process of finding Ba Ruibao, meeting, and negotiating. The court verified the confession and announced that the defendants would be summoned to the court for verification again on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Case to Confirm Invalid Divorce Agreement: Handwriting Needs to be Identified, Witnesses Need to be Summoned Again</h3>
<p>The Zhu Yundi vs. Zhuang Tinggui case continued to be heard yesterday.</p>
<p>Zhuang Tinggui, a native of Wuxi, married Zhu Yundi, a woman from the same town, more than ten years ago. Recently, due to disagreements, they signed a divorce agreement in July of this year. At that time, Zhuang paid Zhu 3,000 yuan for living expenses, and Zhuang also married Luo Lili, a local woman. However, Zhu suddenly claimed that the divorce agreement was forged and sued Zhuang and Luo for bigamy in the First Special District Court. After the trial, the court ruled that whether the crime of bigamy was established depended on whether the divorce agreement was valid. Therefore, it was ordered that the civil court should resolve the issue first. Thus, Zhu filed a case with the civil court to confirm that the divorce agreement was invalid. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Fuji opened the Civil Court No. 2 to summon the defendants. Zhuang Tinggui and his lawyer Chen Tingrui appeared in court to respond. First, Zhu's lawyer stated the meaning of the prosecution, and then the lawyer immediately said that the signature of Zhu on the divorce agreement was a cross. It is most difficult to identify a cross. Even the crosses signed by the intellectual class are not consistent. The cross signed today will not be recognized tomorrow. Therefore, the Civil Code stipulates that for those who sign a cross, there must be at least two witnesses, which is the intention of the law. Therefore, the results of the criminal court's submission for identification, saying that the cross on the agreement was not written by Zhu alone, are unreliable. Moreover, Zhu Rongchu (also known as A'da), the brother of the plaintiff, is also a witness on the agreement. However, due to the circumstances of the criminal court's trial, he was unwilling to appear in court to testify. Please summon him to testify. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that Zhu Rongchu did not exist. Lawyer Chen said that this point can be investigated, why bother to argue? Judge Xu said that this case still needs to summon witnesses, and then announced that the hearing would be postponed.</p>
<h3>Fraudulent Money Collection Agency Cracked in Rice Store Upstairs on North Jiangxi Road</h3>
<p>Victims in Other Ports Send Letters to Shanghai to Report; Han Jiayuan and Others Arrested and Detained for Interrogation</p>
<p>Han Jiayuan from Shaoxing, Dong Wenxiang and Zhou Jincheng from Danyang, Wang Yunxiu from Tianjin, and Mu Ruigen from Zhenjiang recently set up a fake Meiyi Slick Company in the upstairs of a rice store at No. 275 North Jiangxi Road, printing and distributing advertisements to purchase items on behalf of residents and businesses in various ports at home and abroad, charging fees for transportation and making profits from it. There are countless people who are fooled by these guys. Recently, Jin Fuyuan Store in Hunyuan County, Shanxi, remitted 15.20 yuan to the company to purchase a phonograph, a woolen vest, and other items. The payment was sent on November 16 last year, and there has been no news since then. Knowing that the road is long and it is inconvenient to come to Shanghai to investigate, they realized that the company was a fraudulent money collection agency, and they filed a report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. A detective was dispatched to the Hongkou Police Station the day before yesterday, together with Chinese detective Huang Fussen, to secretly go to the address and arrest Han Jiayuan and others, along with an account book, a phonograph, more than a dozen woolen shirts, and other items, and bring them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court No. 3 of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Bureau, said that the place set up by the defendants was very simple, with only a few tables and old benches. The capital was 50 yuan for Mu Ruigen and 40 yuan each for Han Dong Zhou Wang. It was actually a fraudulent agency. Please postpone the trial so that the deceived customers can come to court to testify one after another. When questioned, the defendants' confessions were ambiguous. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered them to be returned to custody and rescheduled for verification.</p>

<h3>Family Lawsuits Persist After Fei Kemin's Death</h3>
<p>Most of the Lawsuits are for Assault and Defamation; Fei Yusheng Sues Fei Zhiwen Again, Resulting in Conviction and Sentencing</p>
<p>Fei Kepeng, a real estate tycoon, owned a lot of assets and had a residence built at No. 70, Lane 741, East Youheng Road. After Fei died of illness in September two years ago, his children began to quarrel over property. Fei's assets were managed by the eldest son, Susheng. Therefore, the second son, Junwen, robbed the spirit tablet and prevented the funeral at Fei Kemin's funeral. Since then, lawsuits between siblings have arisen one after another, and cases of assault and defamation have followed. Recently, Fei Yusheng sued Fei Zhiwen and Fei Yuwen, cousins of the same ancestor, to the Huishan Police Station, alleging that they jointly assaulted him at No. 70, Lane 741, East Youheng Road, at 12:10 AM on the 17th of last month, causing injuries to his head. Yusheng stated that the reason for the assault was that Fei Zhiwen had 1,000 yuan in his possession, which he was now asking for. He said that the housework had not been cleared yet, and if he needed to withdraw the money, he had to obtain the consent of the other siblings. Fei Zhiwen refused and used violence. Chinese detective Huang Fugen sent Fei Yusheng to Tongren Hospital, where it was confirmed that there was slight swelling on his forehead and a medical certificate was issued. He then requested the First Special Court to summon Fei Zhiwen and Fei Yuwen to the Criminal Court No. 2 of the First Special Court yesterday morning. At that time, Judge Zhan Liangce presided over the interrogation. Police station lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the case and prosecuted according to Article 277 of the Criminal Law on Assault. He also said that the defendant Fei Zhiwen had also told the police station that Fei Yusheng had assaulted him, and after being sent to the hospital for examination, there were also abrasions on his left finger. He then presented the medical certificate to the court. Fei Yusheng then stated that Fei Zhiwen punched him once, and Fei Yuwen grabbed his clothes, causing them to be torn. When questioned, Fei Zhiwen denied assaulting the plaintiff, saying that the plaintiff Fei Yusheng had beaten him and bitten his finger. Fei Yuwen denied tearing the plaintiff's clothes. Fei Susheng's younger brother, Fei Junwen, also submitted a statement to the First Special Court, stating that he was willing to assist the defendant in accordance with Article 35 of the Criminal Procedure Law. He was present in court to state his opinion. After Judge Zhan reviewed the statement, he said that the article required that they be within the third degree of kinship to be eligible. Fei Junwen and the two defendants were in the fourth degree of kinship, which was not in accordance with the law, so his request was not approved. The court then sentenced Fei Zhiwen to a fine of 5 yuan and Fei Yuwen was acquitted. Fei Zhiwen immediately stated that he was not satisfied and would appeal.</p>
<h3>Ma Caibin's Lawsuit for Wife</h3>
<p>Ma Yulan Denies Everything; Official Orders Wang A'xiao to be Summoned</p>
<p>Ma Yulan, a 19-year-old woman from Haimen, whose father had passed away, was recruited as a son-in-law by her mother, Ma Ji, in 1935 with the help of matchmakers Xu Ashen and Zhao Zhizhong. Ma Caibao, also 19 years old, was immediately married in front of the spirit. Unexpectedly, in November of last year, Ma Yulan was abducted by a person named Zhu Zhishan and sold to a brothel. After the First Special District Court punished Zhu Zhishan, Zhang Kunlin, also known as Wang A'xiao, came to the court and said that Ma Yulan was his wife. After the news was published in the newspaper, Ma Caibao learned about it and sued Wang A'xiao in the local court for obstructing the family. Yesterday, Judge Lu opened the trial. Ma Caibao testified that he was 19 years old, a native of Haimen, and made a living by planting gardens. He currently lives at No. 22, Dasha New Village, Zhongshan Road. He married into the Ma family in April of last year. At that time, he covered his father-in-law's coffin with red paper and kowtowed to Ma Yulan in front of the spirit. In March 1936, he was recommended by someone to go out to do business. Then his wife and Wang A'xiao became acquainted, but he did not know about it. Later, he saw in the newspaper that his wife was sold into prostitution by Zhu Zhishan, and Wang A'xiao claimed to be her husband. It is clearly his wife, how can he call her his wife? Therefore, he asked the court to handle it. At this point, the mother-in-law, Ma Ji, testified that her husband died in April 1935. Ma Caibao did not formally marry her daughter. Her daughter was robbed by Zhu Zhishan and sold to a brothel. The fake prostitute Wang A'xiao, also known as Zhang Kunlin, divorced her daughter because Ma Caibin did not want her. Zhang Kunlin paid 100 yuan for the divorce, of which 55 yuan had been paid, and 45 yuan was still owed. There was a written agreement to prove it. Ma Yulan testified that she did not marry Ma Caibao and had an affair with Wang A'xiao in March. She had divorced Ma Caibin because she owed him money, so Wang A'xiao was trying to find a way. He should not have come to sue them. The judge then ordered Wang A'xiao to appear in court immediately, otherwise he would be wanted. If both parties can reconcile, then he can withdraw the lawsuit.</p>

<h3>Chen Feng's Lawsuit Against Daughter-in-law - Injury Charge Not Established</h3>
<p>Convicted of Destroying Another's Property - Chen Li fined 20 yuan</p>
<p>Chen Yunzhong, former Chinese detective of the Public Concession Police, has been living with his wife, Feng, at No. 3, Lane 201, Shanhai Pass Road, since resigning from his position. They have two sons, Bingxing and Maoyi, who have grown up, married, and have children. Both Chen Bingxing and his brother Maoyi graduated from law schools, so they joined the local Bar Association and practiced law. Except for Chen Maoyi, who lives elsewhere, Chen Bingxing, his wife, and children live with his parents. On the afternoon of the 16th of last month, Bingxing's 16-year-old son, Songyuan, returned home from school a little late, and his mother, Li (Bingxing's wife), scolded him. At that time, Bingxing's mother, Ms. Feng, intervened to protect her grandson, leading to a conflict. Li slapped her mother-in-law twice and tore her qipao. Ms. Chen Feng felt that her daughter-in-law, Li, dared to strike an elder, which was lawless, and reported it to the Xin Zha police station. The police station filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Division of the First Special Court for the crime of injuring a senior relative. The Special Court issued a summons, but Chen Li refused to appear, so she was arrested and detained. Yesterday morning, Judge Pan Zhenyang continued the trial in the Fifth Criminal Court. Chen Feng and witnesses testified that she was slapped and her clothes were torn by her daughter-in-law. In addition to legal punishment, she requested compensation of 20 yuan for the clothing damage. The defendant, Chen Li, denied the assault and hired a lawyer to argue that there was no act of insulting a senior relative. The reason for the prosecution was that the defendant's husband, lawyer Chen Bingxing, disliked the defendant's appearance and kept a mistress near their residence. Therefore, this prosecution was intended to subject the defendant to criminal punishment, laying the groundwork for a future divorce. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, stated that the plaintiff had not suffered any injury. Therefore, the charge of injury was difficult to establish and should be judged according to the crimes of destroying property and public insult. Chen Feng stated that she would also prosecute for the damage. However, after persuasion, the court expressed its willingness to withdraw the incidental civil suit for compensation for clothing. Judge Pan reviewed the statements and sentenced Chen Li to a fine of 20 yuan for destroying another's property. If she could not pay, two yuan would be counted as one day of detention.</p>
<h3>Kang Yuan Factory Lawsuit Concluded Yesterday</h3>
<p>Verdict on the 11th</p>
<p>The Industrial News Agency reports that Gu Qiushui from Jiaxing operated a porcelain flower factory in Shanghai before the January 28th Incident. Due to poor business, he was unable to maintain it. He entrusted someone to contact the Kang Yuan Canning Factory to transfer all machinery and property to Kang Yuan Factory. At that time, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, the owner of Kang Yuan Factory, believed that the porcelain industry was a famous Chinese industry and that porcelain kiln paper was a tool to improve the art of porcelain. Since Mr. Gu was skilled in this field, he should be maintained. Therefore, a porcelain flower department was added to the factory, and Mr. Gu was hired as the head of the department. A preferential contract was signed, and all affairs were entrusted to Mr. Gu. Unexpectedly, after the products were launched, due to poor quality, sales were difficult. After three years, various consignment stores returned the inventory, causing Kang Yuan Factory to lose tens of thousands of gold. When the contract expired, Mr. Gu had breached the contract and set up a new factory. He then left Kang Yuan Factory. However, the new factory founded by Mr. Gu also closed shortly after due to poor product quality. In frustration, he reviewed Kang Yuan Factory's business report for 1934, believing that the porcelain flower department he had presided over in the past still had a surplus, and he could share the dividends according to the contract. He filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against the factory, demanding payment of profits. In fact, the numbers listed in the report were typographical errors and did not match the original table made by accountant Xu Yongzuo. The factory had discarded the publication and reprinted it. Mr. Gu did not carefully review the table before filing the lawsuit and requested the defendant to submit the accounts for review. The factory filed a statement of defense and submitted the account books. After the court summoned them previously, the plaintiff was speechless due to the facts. At 3:00 PM on July 7th, the case was continued to be heard. Xu Fuji was still the judge in charge. Both the plaintiff and defendant, accompanied by lawyers, were present to await the hearing. After the judge took the seat, he asked Gu Qiushui if he had seen the account books. According to the testimony, the accounts had been reviewed. However, there was a total inventory of more than 15,000 yuan at the end of 1935. This inventory should be regarded as a surplus, and the contract should be followed. He could get 5% of the bonus, so according to the semi-finished products of more than 7,000 yuan at the end of June 1935, he should be paid 2,052 yuan and 84 cents. Hearing the testimony, the judge reprimanded him, saying that the company's account books had been handed over to you for review, so you could understand them. But now you say that the accounts are inconsistent, then you must entrust an accountant to verify them. However, if you want to verify, you must first pay the accounting fee before you can do so. Now that you have not paid the fee for verification, and you are making accusations, are you intentionally picking faults? As for the inventory, the goods have not yet been sold. How can you force the profit and demand a bonus? The plaintiff was reprimanded and lowered his head without a word. Then, according to the defendant's statement, the account books of the porcelain flower department had been checked by accountant Xu Yongzuo, and the account books were submitted on November 8, 1936. The two parties checked them clearly. Now the surplus pointed out by the plaintiff is actually the company's inventory. The inventory is the company's asset and cannot be regarded as profit. The court should reject it. After the lawyers of both parties debated and concluded the court debate, the verdict was scheduled to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 12th of this month. After the announcement, the court adjourned.</p>

The three boarded the car, and the car drove straight west. When the car arrived near Tian Yao Bridge Road on Zhongshan Road, the three ordered the car to stop. One of them pulled out a pistol and ordered the driver to get out of the car. He was driven to a secluded mound by the roadside and forced to take off his uniform and hat. The driver's limbs were tied with rope. Then, one of them put on the uniform and drove the car away at lightning speed. Later, a passerby discovered it, untied him, and urgently reported it to the police station in charge. He also notified the British and French police to pay attention to intercepting it. However, as of 11:00 PM, the car had not been found. The purpose of the car robbery is currently under close investigation.</p>
<h3>Bank Employee Embezzles Public Funds</h3>

<h3>Zidi Gentry and Merchants Request Dredging of Panlong River</h3>
<p>The gentry of Zidi Town (also known as Zhuzhai) in the western suburbs of the city, Hou Shuda and Huang Chengbo, and more than 100 businesses in the town, including Wang Dachang and Huang Rumao, stated that the Panlong River in the city has not been dredged for a hundred years since the end of the Qing Dynasty and the founding of the Republic of China. It is extremely silted up, and the narrow and shallow places are like ditches, which greatly affect commerce, transportation, sanitation, and fire prevention. In 1935, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works approved the proposal to start construction. However, the government only allowed 70% of the funding for water diversion and dam construction, and the remaining 30% was to be borne by the local area. Zidi was unable to raise the funds, and it has become a suspended case to this day. Mr. Hou, Mr. Huang, and the town's businesses believe that the "Labor Service" campaign in Shanghai can open the river without requiring huge amounts of money. They believe it is a good opportunity, so they emphasized the important position of the Panlong River in the waterway transportation between the west of Shanghai and this city, the impact of siltation on commerce, transportation, sanitation, and fire prevention, and sent a letter to the Local Association, requesting the municipal authorities to dredge it. They also urgently submitted a request to the Municipal Government Bureau of Public Works to amend the Labor Service Committee's proposal, allowing the laborers under the jurisdiction of the 30th Bao, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th Tus of the Pu Song District, that is, the old Zidi (Zhuzhai) Township, to dredge the Panlong River nearby. The rest of the Pu Song District will continue the original proposal to dredge the Shuangyang Port and the Shahe Southern Section in separate stages, so as to achieve both goals and facilitate transportation.</p>

Following this is another astonishing work, "Lifeline," which also won the praise of the Guangzhou Film Censorship Association. Mr. Liu is currently continuing to create the film "Gold Mountain Spectacle" in the United States.

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the news item "Yihua Steamer Line Back Cabin Workers Oppose Affairs Group Office" published in your newspaper on the 6th, upon reading it, I found that it does not conform to the facts. The details of the incident are summarized as follows. Please publish it to correct the record. Thank you. To the Shen Bao, ㊀ The Seamen's Union Organization Law stipulates that Grade B seamen are divided into five departments: stokers, sailors, cargo handlers, middle cabin, and affairs. Mess boys belong to the affairs department and should be led by the affairs organization. Therefore, the affairs personnel of Yihua Steamer Line can legally organize the Yihua Affairs Mutual Aid Association. There is absolutely no reason for the so-called back cabin Tongyishe to oppose and ask the union to prevent its establishment. ㊁ After inviting Mr. Wang Xiaolai and Mr. Li Zuqu as Vice Presidents, the Yihua Affairs Mutual Aid Association has applied to the Seamen's Party Department for approval. A small number of workers from Tongyishe asked the Party Department to refuse to issue a permit. The Party Department did not think it was right. ㊂ The affairs personnel of each steamer line treat the mess boys with sincerity. Most mess boys are willing to be led by the affairs personnel. The so-called affairs personnel oppressing the mess boys by deducting wages and firing workers is completely untrue. The petition must have been made by one or two unscrupulous people using the name of Tongyishe. Yihua Steamer Line Affairs Department Office, January 7th.</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the news published in your newspaper on January 7th, this city, regarding the new achievements of Director Zhang of the China Merchants Inland River Steamer Bureau, it does not conform to the facts. Upon investigation, this Bureau has not announced any suspension of navigation to the outside world, but has only made some internal reforms. Furthermore, there is no appointment of the title of Director. We are especially afraid of misrepresentation. We hope you will correct it to avoid inaccuracies. We hereby send a letter to the Editorial Department of the Shen Bao, hoping you will investigate and handle it. Lao Mian, Manager of the China Merchants Inland River Steamer General Bureau, January 7th.</p>

<h3>World Professional Tennis Decisive Battle: Perry Overwhelms Vines</h3>
<p>7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. Superior skill completely controls Vines.</p>
<p>New York, 6th (Reuters) - British tennis star Perry defeated Vines in four sets in Madison Square Garden tonight in a professional match, overturning all previous expectations. The scores were 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.</p>
<p>The audience was quite large, totaling 17,633 people, who paid a total of US$58,117 in tickets to watch the British player win the World Professional Tennis Championship. This kind of grand occasion is a new record for professional tennis.</p>
<p>Perry's victory was entirely deserved, demonstrating superior skill, accuracy, and the ability to hold his ground. Initially, he was not accustomed to the felt court. In the first set, he slightly injured his ankle in a slip, but he soon got used to it, demonstrating brilliant and unstoppable tennis skills, completely controlling Vines.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Vines went to the net more often than his opponent. After losing the first set, he took a 3-0 lead in the second set. Perry then equalized. Vines won three more games, and as a result Vines only won this set.</p>
<h3>China-Portugal Billiards Battle Heats Up: Ding Mingyi vs. Medina</h3>
<p>6:30 PM at the Chinese Youth Billiards Room. Yesterday's results: Portugal won by 18 points.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Amateur Billiards League, between the Chinese YMCA and Portugal, has now become a stalemate. On the first day, Portugal won by 32 points in two matches. Yesterday, on the second day, China won by 14 points in two matches. Today, Ding Mingyi, the main player of the Chinese Youth, and Medina, the leader of Portugal, will personally compete. The game will begin at 6:30 PM at the Chinese YMCA billiards room on Sichuan Road. The final victory or defeat will be determined by this. Ding Mingyi's skills are already above the general standard. In today's Shanghai billiards scene, only Li Gongying and Zhang Yingda can compete with Medina. Ding Mingyi is comparable to them. Failure is undeniable, but it is hoped that he will have a good performance. The Chinese Youth is still behind by 18 points after two days, probably due to the heavy losses suffered by Fang Yide on the first day. Yesterday, Zhu Qiliang had a good chance of winning, but due to careless handling, he was defeated by Kang Shisi by 295 to 300. When Zhu was at his peak, he had a lead of 220 to 130. Therefore, he could have at least won back 30 to 40 points. The result of the failure was unexpected. The highest records were Kang Shisi 20, 40, 21, 26, and Zhu Qiliang 63, 31, 31, 29.</p>
<p>In the last match yesterday, Wu Chengqi and Su Shi both showed signs of unease on the court. Wu advanced boldly with 24 points in one shot, followed by 30 points in another shot, taking the lead. Afterwards, wonderful shots were exchanged between the two, sometimes high and sometimes low. Su Shi relied on 36 and 75 points in two shots to lead by 236 to 207. Before long, Wu was fortunate to have 23 points in one shot, turning the situation into a balanced one. Finally, Wu gained another 21 points in one shot, totaling 298 points, only 2 points away from the goal. Su Shi used a scorched earth tactic, preferring to sacrifice rather than act rashly. Wu's last shot succeeded in 2 points, while Su had already hit the enemy ball into the pocket and hit both the red and white balls into the serving area.

<h3>West Youth Basketball Last Night</h3>
<p>Jinan defeats Xin Team. Chizhi defeats Nanjin.</p>
<p>In West Youth Basketball, Chizhi played against Nanjin in the university group last night. Nanjin's players were taking exams, so only five players appeared on the court. Chizhi first responded with its most complete lineup, making it difficult for Nanjin to resist. Even Chen Lin, the young general who is best at shooting, lost his grip. Therefore, the result of the first half was that Chizhi 26, Nanjin 14, and the victory or defeat was already determined. After the restart, Chizhi rotated all ten generals to respond to the battle, and the score increased even more. Nanjin chased fiercely, showing great excitement. About eight minutes away from the end of the game, Wang Yinxi, the right guard of Nanjin, was sent off for four fouls, and there was no one to replace him. Therefore, he responded with four players, and the defense was breached. In the end, he lost by 66 to 34. Chizhi won by a large margin. The next match was Jinan against Xin Team. Xin Team's main players did not play, and only the reserve soldiers responded to the battle. At first, both sides were too excited, and the throws were all clumsy. After Yin Guiren opened the record with a free throw, Yao Siwen of Xin Team scored under the basket and got a free throw to surpass 3 to 1. After that, there were many fouls on both sides. Xin Team was even more depressed. Jinan Han Cai Kuang instantly added 5 points, and Jia Youliang scored repeatedly, 6 to 5, once close. But after that, Yin Guiren was bound to hit every throw, and Han Zhenyuan, Wang Nanzhen, and Cai Yanxiong also made multiple embellishments. In an instant, the score was an absolute difference of 21 to 5. At this time, Xin Team had adjusted Lu Zhongen and Ling Xianyang, and gradually saw its spirit. Yin Guiren, on the other hand, missed every throw. Xin Team once made it 25 to 15, only 10 points behind. Before long, Jinan added 3 points, ending the first half with 28 to 15. After the restart, the three of Jinan, Han Cai Yin, withdrew and were replaced by Yuan Zheng Yan. After Xu Jusheng of Xin Team succeeded, both sides did not score for a long time, and turned into a dull situation. Soon Xu Jusheng was sent off for four fouls, and Jia Youliang came on again, and there were scores for each other, until 34 to 25, Xin Team was only 10 points behind. At this time, the Han Yin Cai of Jinan regained the field, but it was not sharp. Both sides had not opened the record for a long time, and Yao of Xin Team, after re-entering the field, was sent off. Jinan was thriving again. The game ended when Jia Youliang scored a long shot. As a result, Jinan won by a large margin of 40 to 27. There are three games today, two in the independent group, and one in the ordinary group. Except for the Yellow Bee vs. McLing A, which is still worth watching, the Xintong vs. McLing B is bound to be a one-sided game.</p>

<h3>First Anniversary Memorial Ceremony for Ding Wenjiang's Death</h3>
<p>Li Shuhua, Hu Shi, and others delivered speeches.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping] The 5th was the first anniversary of the death of Ding Wenjiang, the former director of the Geological Survey of the Academia Sinica. Three agencies and organizations in Beiping, the Geological Society of China, the Department of Geology of Peking University, and the Beiping Branch of the Geological Survey of the Ministry of Industry, launched a memorial ceremony at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th in the library of the Geological Survey on Bingmasi Street. More than 60 people attended the memorial ceremony, which adjourned at 5:30 PM. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Memorial Ceremony</p>
<p>At the appointed time on the afternoon of the 5th, about 60 people, including Ding's lifelong friends Li Shuhua, Hu Shi, Zhou Binglin, Chen 𪣵, Grip, Yuan Fuli, Yang Zhongjian, Feng Jinglan, Zhang Hongzhao, Wei Dengrui, Xie Jiarong, and Jiang's disciples, arrived. Yang Zhongjian, director of the Beiping Branch of the Geological Survey, presided over the ceremony. Hu Shi, Zhang Hongzhao, Grip, and others delivered speeches. The ceremony was simple and solemn. After the ceremony, Hu Shi played Ding's pre-death lecture films that he brought. The attendees were able to see and hear the images, which gave them the feeling that he had been resurrected. At 5:30 PM, everyone visited the exhibition of Ding's relics at the venue before dispersing.</p>
<p>Yang's Report</p>
<p>The presiding officer Yang Zhongjian reported, stating briefly that today is the first anniversary of Mr. Ding Wenjiang's death. In Beiping, the Geological Society of China, the Department of Geology of Peking University, and the Geological Survey launched this memorial meeting to commemorate Mr. Ding's greatness. Regarding the commemoration of Mr. Ding, special issues have been published in the Geological Review and Independent Review. Now the English Geological Bulletin is also being printed in a special issue, which will be published soon. In Nanjing, more than 42,000 yuan of memorial funds have been raised. However, in addition to this commemoration, the greatest and most beloved thing for Mr. Ding is that the three groups preparing this meeting are following Mr. Ding's legacy, burying themselves in research. Although today's ceremony is simple, its significance is very great. Therefore, in addition to holding the ceremony, we have also invited several gentlemen who had the deepest relationship with Mr. Ding during his lifetime to speak, and so on.</p>
<p>Hu Shi and others speak</p>
<p>After the report, Hu Shi delivered a speech, stating briefly that today's commemoration of Mr. Ding makes all of us who had a relationship with him during his lifetime feel a few indescribable pangs of sorrow. Before his death, he not only handled all the procedures and official affairs very well, but also arranged his family affairs very properly. But there is only one thing that makes him unable to rest in peace after his death, that is, his unfinished work. Secondly, what we should pay attention to is that during his lifetime, he was not only a geologist, but also had great research on politics and economics. During his lifetime, he once said to people that if we want to live a political life in the future, we should have several preparations. The first is to preserve our qualifications as "good people." The second is to be a person with a profession. The third is to find a way to not increase our living standards. The fourth is to unite our friends, small groups of four or five people, eight or nine people, and try to make a tool of political life. From this, we know that Mr. Ding's career and spirit during his lifetime have his great value. Then, Zhang Hongzhao, the former director of the Beiping Branch of the Geological Survey, and Grip, a professor in the Department of Geology of Peking University, delivered speeches.</p>
<p>Exhibition of Works</p>
<p>On the 5th, in order to commemorate Mr. Ding Wenjiang's great achievements during his lifetime, more than ten kinds of Mr. Ding's works, posthumous writings, letters, wills, original manuscripts, travel photos, and maps of domestic work areas were specially displayed in front of the venue for the attendees to visit and commemorate.</p>

<h3>Yi Junzuo and More Than Twenty Others Initiate the Jiangsu Literary and Artistic Writers' Advancement Association</h3>
<p>And Issue a Declaration of the Chinese National Literary and Artistic Movement</p>
<p>Yi Junzuo and more than twenty others initiated the "Jiangsu Literary and Artistic Writers' Advancement Association" and issued a declaration of the Chinese National Literary and Artistic Movement, stating: Fellow countrymen, literary and artistic writers across the country, and all who love literature and art,</p>
<p>We must recognize the current era, the current China. The current era is one of rampant international imperialism. They never relax their aggressive ambitions, and they are scheming to oppress and trample on us. The current China has reached the final critical moment of life and death. Within our own country, there are still traitors who sell the soul of the motherland, and "red bandits" who kill without batting an eye. These two kinds of national scum are constantly trying to sabotage our country and subvert our nation. China, in such an extraordinary period, cannot rely on any external forces except self-reliance. Our greatest task is to promote the great spirit inherent in our nation. To put it precisely, it is how to resist insults and how to seek survival. To resist insults and seek survival is how to eliminate traitors and how to eliminate remnant bandits, so as to embark on the road of self-reliance and revitalize our nation.</p>
<p>Literature and art should be based on ideology, and it is necessary to grasp the tasks of the current era and not forget the significance of one's own nation. Therefore, the establishment of "national literature and art" has become an inevitable trend in literature at this stage.</p>
<p>We are pained by the fact that so-called "proletarian writers" are using the beautiful names of "people's front" and "national defense literature" to poison the minds of all pure and innocent young people. We also oppose the shameless behavior of the Communist Party and all reactionaries who use these two beautiful names of "people's front" and "national defense literature."</p>
<p>The greatest meaning of "national literature and art" is how to establish our great "national front," how to determine our "national" consciousness in literature, and how to expand our anti-imperialist, anti-communist, and feudal forces. Anything that stimulates the national spirit of creation, encourages the expression of scientific spirit, cultivates production and construction, elucidates the inherent virtues of the nation, and guides the masses on the right path is the proper posture of "national literature and art."</p>
<p>The "national literature and art" we need is the "literature and art" that suits the current era and the Chinese national character. Conversely, the literature and art that we do not need and should reject includes the following six points: (1) We should eliminate proletarian literature and art that endangers the nation. (2) We should eliminate decadent literature and art of sentimentalism. (3) We should correct romantic literature and art of individualism. (4) We should clear up feudal literature and art with corrupt ideas. (5) We should cleanse slave literature and art of flattery and adulation. (6) We should oppose humorous literature and art of the privileged class.</p>
<p>We pledge to devote our lives to the construction movement of Chinese national literature and art. Now that we have a great and sacred literary and artistic goal, we are willing to unite literary and artistic writers across the country to advance towards this goal. In order to actively build Chinese national literature and art, we intend to have four preliminary plans:</p>
<p>1. Theoretical construction: to establish the theory of "national literature and art" so that they are complete, substantial, and powerful.</p>
<p>2. Encouragement of creation: to encourage the creation of "national literature and art" so that it grasps the core of the nation in the current era and can express it profoundly.</p>
<p>3. Emphasis on introduction: to introduce and promote the "national literature and art" of various countries in the world for our own reference and comparison, as a mirror for national revival.</p>
<p>4. Promotion of historical achievements: to collect, sort out, and promote the historical materials and precious literary and artistic materials inherent in our country regarding "national literature and art" in order to strengthen national self-confidence.</p>
<p>In order to consolidate the "national literature and art" bulwark, rectify the "national literature and art" lineup, and unify the "national literature and art" front, we are now launching the "Jiangsu Literary and Artistic Writers' Advancement Association" in Zhenjiang, the provincial capital of Jiangsu. We look forward to the encouragement and guidance of our compatriots across the country, and we sincerely hope that literary and artistic writers across the country will unite and promote this great Chinese literary and artistic construction movement. This is our declaration. Yi Junzuo, Wang Ci, Zhang Xinyu, Xing Songwen, Shi Qian, Wan Xiaofeng, Xu Ruoping, Ruan Yisun, Huang Xueyi, Wu Dingdi, Wu Bofang, Li Yixian, Ying Zheyuan, Zhou Dilian, Hu Yunyi, Chuan Xiaodong, Wang Wumin, Zuo Ganchen, Ge Xianning, Huang Liren, Huang Qiang, Zhou Huapeng.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Third-Grade Yarn Soars, Impact on Standard Yarn Still Minor, Factories Opening Many, Stockpiles Gradually Thickening</p>
<p>The yarn market has turned upward, mainly because the bulk third-grade yarn market soared by nine to twelve yuan, which shocked the market. Buying enthusiasm has risen slightly, but generally, industry peers see that the factories' stocks of yarn are becoming more relaxed day by day and expect to accumulate stock. The courage to hoard in bulk is gradually waning, so the upward momentum is limited. In fact, there is enough capital in coarse yarn, so it cannot soar with the third-grade yarn. In the afternoon, it was also reported that the British factory opened 7,000 to 8,000 bales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd. This news was reported in this newspaper earlier, and it is said that the price is very low. The detailed situation is kept strictly secret.</p>
<p>Near-Term Yarn Also Rises by Two Yuan Seven or Eight Jiao</p>
<p>The opening of the standard yarn market saw a slight increase in each month, but most people in the market expected it to fall back because the end of the year is approaching, and accounts are settled to some extent according to commercial practice. The sharp rise in bulk Osaka third-grade yarn pushed the current month above the 270 yuan mark, and people's hearts were stirred up. The market price rebounded slightly, but gradually trended higher. At the opening, only 500 to 600 bales of yarn were traded, and then the market became tired. As a result, each month rose by 2.6 jiao to 1.1 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon, the Osaka third-grade yarn took a leap forward, and the near-term two months all broke through the 270 yuan mark. The shorts were shaken and covered their positions. However, it was rumored that the factories had opened a lot of cotton yarn, so the rise was moderate. However, the Japanese merchants had a large short position, and 1,300 bales of yarn were traded. At the close, the price went up another step. As a result, each month rose by 1.5 to 7.9 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 1,200 bales of Yongda were sold, 750 bales of Dafu, 1,950 bales of Mianchang, 800 bales of Yuanda, 1,350 bales of Zhenda, 1,000 bales of Yida, 2,150 bales of Taichang, 1,350 bales of Tonghe, 1,150 bales of Yihe, 700 bales of Changfeng, 950 bales of Xiecheng, 600 bales of Xincheng, and 650 bales of Jinkang. 1,150 bales of Dafeng were bought, 2,200 bales of Hengyi, 1,150 bales of Taixing, 6,550 bales of Gengfeng, 3,150 bales of Wangtaixing, 650 bales of Shenji, and 600 bales of Fengtai. The market prices for the day are compared below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Also Rises by One or Two Yuan</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still quite good. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 1,314 bales throughout the day, and the selling price rose by 1.2 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Futures Also See a Small Upturn</p>
<p>The cotton market was originally dull and lackluster. In addition, the overseas US and Indian cotton markets were weak, and the local goods in this port had not decreased. Those who sold short at the time of the rise were even more numerous. In the afternoon, the market was also in a good state due to the yarn market.</p>
<p>The Market Will Be Aided by the Standard Cotton</p>
<p>The opening of the standard cotton market in the morning was still weak because US cotton rose slightly, and Indian cotton fell sharply, and people's hearts were not振. After a round of rumors that the yarn market had rebounded, Osaka third-grade cotton also rose by 3.4 jiao, and the market became revitalized. By the third closing, it entered a fatigue state again. As a result, each month fell by one or two jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon, the market situation was still flat. Although the third-grade yarn market jumped sharply, the upward momentum of the cotton market was moderate, and people's hearts were still平. Until the third-grade cotton kerchief also rose, the market was affected. As a result, each month rose by 2.5 to 3.5 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 3,900 piculs of Shengyuan were sold, 3,300 piculs of Jinchang, 2,400 piculs of Jifeng, 4,700 piculs of Hengyi, 3,100 piculs of Fengtai, 2,100 piculs of Runkang, 2,100 piculs of Changhe, 2,200 piculs of Daqing, 3,100 piculs of Gengfeng, 3,600 piculs of Taichang, and 2,400 piculs of Xinchang. 1,800 piculs of Tongji were bought, 3,900 piculs of Yudai, 2,700 piculs of Senkang, 1,700 piculs of Yuanyi, 3,200 piculs of Dachangcheng, 2,700 piculs of Dachang, 1,900 piculs of Yongda, 6,000 piculs of Taixing, and 2,100 piculs of Changfeng. The market prices for the day are compared below.</p>
<p>More Than 3,000 Bales of Yaotong Cotton</p>
<p>The consumption of spot cotton is mediocre, and the factory owner has not seen any great joy. The source is 1,600 bales of Yao cotton and 1,680 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Third-Grade Yarn Soars by More Than Ten Yuan</p>
<p>On the 7th, the big isolated telegram said that the third-grade futures yarn rose by 7.8 jiao to 12.3 yuan, with the near month at 277.8 yuan and the far month at 257.9 yuan. Cotton futures rose by 7 jiao to 1.05 yuan, with the near month at 71.65 yuan and the far month at 73.6 yuan.</p>
<p>US Cotton Rebounds, British and Indian Cotton Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened, the Liverpool news was not good, the bulls closed, the labor unrest was uncertain, the European political situation was unstable, and each month fell by 5 pounds or rose by 2 pounds. Later, there was hope for a solution to the labor unrest, and the industry bought, and the market rebounded strongly. The spot goods were quiet and expensive, and the cloth market was more active than before. Before the close, cotton farmers cashed in, and part of it fell slightly. At the close, the industry bought the near month, and the market price rose again, with the spot goods rising by 5 pounds and the futures rising from motionless to 5 pounds. British cotton spot goods fell by 6 points, and futures fell by 23 points. Indian cotton fell at first due to hedging and sales by holders, and then rebounded due to purchases by speculators. Finally, due to the bad news from Liverpool, the market price softened again. It is estimated that Pingguoer fell by 2.75 to 3.25 rupees, Aomuchen fell by 1 to 1.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 6th).</p>
<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast on the 7th was 227 rupees for Bailuoxi and 204.5 rupees for Mula, and 174 rupees for Pingguoer, all up by 1 rupee.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Cotton Market Recovers Slightly in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was tired in the morning and strong in the afternoon. Although the wholesale Zhuang in Zhe Road and this street had very good spot sales for several days, the appetite of the major customers in the north and south was weak. The white goods are fine and fine twill. The output of this port and the goods coming from Qingdao are becoming more and more prosperous every day. The market suddenly suffers from a lot of goods, so the market price fell again and again. However, because futures are strong and expensive, manufacturers have a stable mindset, and spot sales are still not bad, so the decline is not fierce. According to interviews, each piece of fine cloth and fine twill of each brand fell by 1.2 jiao in the past two days. The market continued to fall in the morning yesterday. Later, the third-grade yarn market soared by more than ten yuan, and the standard yarn continued to rise, stirring up people's spirits. The Japanese Dongmian 洋行 reappeared and bought fine cloths such as Hualiao brand, causing the cloth price to rebound by 2.5 cents to 5 cents per piece.

<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Tianjin Merchants Resume Purchases, Flour Price Decline Stabilizes</p>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening bell in the morning, the market for all months continued to show sluggish and weak signs. Foreign wheat prices reported declines of approximately 0.30 cents for near-term contracts in Chicago and 0.48 cents for distant contracts. Canadian prices fluctuated by about 0.08 cents. Liverpool saw a slight increase of 0.01 pence in near-term contracts. At the opening, market sentiment remained poor, and many long positions were liquidated. The opening price for the current month was only $4.09, a decrease of 0.0425 from the previous day. February and subsequent months fell by 0.01 to 0.02 cents. During the second trading session, near-term contracts saw a slight rally, but long positions for distant contracts continued to be sold off, causing opening prices to weaken again, with distant contracts falling 0.02 to 0.03 cents from the initial opening. The afternoon opening began calmly, but outside long positions re-entered the market. It was rumored that Tianjin merchants were involved, leading to a gradual rise in prices from the second session onwards, with March and April contracts rising by 0.03 to 0.04 cents, while January and February contracts remained down 0.01 to 0.02 cents.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Fluctuate Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after the opening bell in the morning, all months showed signs of weakness. Foreign wheat prices in Chicago fell by only 0.30 cents, with little other movement. Therefore, although trading was active after the opening, market sentiment tended to hover. For example, while opening prices for February, March, and April rose by 0.05 to 0.06 cents, they soon retraced, falling slightly more than 0.03 to 0.05 cents from the previous day. At the afternoon opening, sentiment for the current month stabilized due to the suspension of spot trading by factories, with the lowest price reaching 0.57 cents. Trading in February and subsequent months became sparse, with little movement. New wheat for June initially fell to 0.59 cents, but rebounded by 0.03 to 0.04 cents due to outside buying. Currently, near-term wheat is expected to be under pressure if flour sales remain sluggish. Although the market value of new wheat for June is lower than that of old wheat, it is closely related to the annual harvest, making it difficult to predict gains or losses. Spot wheat saw no inquiries from various factories, with only a rumor of 1,000+ bags of Jiangbei wheat being offered at $6.51, but this was not a formal transaction.</p>
<p>Foreign Firm Sesame Sales Remain Active, Soybean Cake Prices Fluctuate</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign firms continued to sell 900 tons of sesame through the Central Trust Bureau at a price of $14.95 per original plate. It was rumored that British merchants commissioned the purchase, stabilizing spot raw sesame prices at around $11.00. Yesterday, the market saw transactions of over 400 loads of various sesames from Fuzhou Ben Shu, etc. Soybean cake market prices showed mixed results due to a few factories holding relatively large inventories, followed by price drops to stimulate demand. A total of over 50,000 cakes of various factory brands were traded across the market, with sales in Shantou, Xiamen, and the inland regions. The overall market trend remains stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Domestic Brown Sugar Price Increase Continues</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to see active trading due to constant price increases reported from Shantou for Chaozhou brown sugar. Chaozhou dealers offered over 1,000 loads of table sugar, priced at $14.00 for Huanggang brown sugar, $13.90 for Huanggang brown sugar, $13.67 for Huilai brown sugar, and $13.45 for Longjiang brown sugar, all increasing by 0.10 to 0.20 cents, indicating a tight market. Our own cotton white sugar retreated slightly by 0.10 cents, with Jinxin Dahua at $20.08, and grades 2, 3, 4, and 5 retreating by 0.20 cents per grade. The foreign sugar market was normal. The Public Concession market saw grade 24 sugar at $22.10, with transshipment at $6.80. Grade 4 Dongbai sugar was at $20.10, with transshipment at $7.05, down by 0.05 cents.

<h3>Dried and Fresh Goods</h3>

<p>Longkou vermicelli has maintained a very firm market trend recently. Yesterday, it was heard that wholesale prices had reached $27.00, with 50 packages traded. Domestic street demand is currently weak, but market prices remain stable. Assorted grades (92 skin) are selling for $26.00 to $25.50, with no expected easing due to limited supply.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Silk Sales Temporarily Lack Momentum</p>
<p>Yesterday, silk prices on the New York Stock Exchange saw a sharp decline of 3.5 cents for all current contracts, while Japanese and Chinese silk products remained at previous prices. Opening prices in Yokohama fell slightly by $5.00 to $10.00. Lyon remained stagnant. Foreign firms in this port remain inactive. Overseas silk prices are fluctuating, silk merchants are maintaining high prices, and foreign firms are sending few re-export orders. Only American firms are slightly covering shorts, with 70 packages of White Factory silk traded at prices with little fluctuation. Therefore, silk exports are not expected to strengthen in the short term.</p>
<p>Chinese Silk Exports to the US Decreased by 600 Packages Last December</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to a Reuters report on New York raw silk inventory and sales, raw silk imports decreased in December. Japanese silk decreased by 4,905 packages compared to the previous month, Chinese silk decreased by 602 packages, and European silk increased by 21 packages.

<h3>Confession</h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>I've only been in the same cell with this fellow inmate for a little over ten days, but I can already sense that he is different from the others in many ways. The first thing is his unusual appearance. While most inmates have their heads shaved every fifty or sixty days, and their hair and beards are thick and black, his scalp is shiny and his face is smooth. Even the prisoner's hair, a mere wisp, is only a tiny bit long. Furthermore, his arms are very thick and strong, but his face shows no flesh at all, and his ribs are clearly countable, which is quite incongruous.</p>
<p>Secondly, because he works as a gardening inmate, and the weather was still hot at the time, he had to water the plants early in the morning and late at night. Every day, he would leave the cell earlier than the others. Often, before exercise even started in the cell, the guard would come with the list to call him out. In the evening, he would return later than the others, always carrying a basin full of hot water, swaying back and forth, as if he had found a treasure, and hurriedly stepped into the cell door. People in the cell often complained of thirst. He would fetch hot water in broad daylight to moisten their throats, not afraid of scalding himself or hearing the reprimands of the authorities. Everyone was very grateful to him.</p>
<p>Although he went to work early, he still needed to trouble me for some time every day after getting up. If you believe in fate, it was truly destined. At night, we slept on the same cell plank, and we sat side by side reading in the early morning. However, his reading was mostly looking up words in the dictionary. Once he found a new word, he would always hold up the book and ask me, "Old Xu! What does this word mean?"</p>
<p>Because he was reading English and checking the English-Chinese dictionary. Although he could find the new word he was looking for according to the English alphabet, he couldn't recognize the Chinese characters that were written there. He hadn't read a single Chinese book. It was said that his parents had died long ago, and he had been sent to work on ships by his maternal uncle since he was a child. He had always worked in the engine room, constantly using force to chisel coal, so his arms were very strong. Having been on foreign ships for a long time, he felt that knowing a little English could be advantageous. Therefore, regardless of when he could leave the prison, and regardless of whether he could go back to working on ships after leaving the prison, he would hum and read English whenever he had the chance. Naturally, his level was quite basic. This was his first unique characteristic.</p>
<p>His fourth unique characteristic was in the evening. When the electric light was not bright enough to read, he would always sit there blankly, without making a sound, always frowning. After many days, he finally told me that he was planning how to write his confession. Although at that time, the days of detention were being converted into a sentence, with two days counting as one, and he hadn't been sentenced for very long, it was still a long way off before he could write a confession and be transferred to a reformatory after serving one-sixth of his sentence.</p>
<p>"How do you write a confession?"</p>
<p>After telling me that he couldn't figure it out, he repeatedly asked me this question, and he also repeatedly asked the inmates he was close to, often asking several times in a three- or five-minute conversation.</p>
<p>In prison, there is an unspoken creed: when heavy objects need to be moved, the farmers and laborers step forward. When writing, sending letters, making reports, or writing confessions, the intellectuals have an inescapable duty.</p>
<p>Writing confessions is, of course, a common thing. Not only do illiterate inmates need someone to write it for them, but the authorities also prefer to have someone write it for them, because this is necessary to complete the procedures. It is not difficult to write a confession for someone else. Just take the sentence and look it up. If there is already a confession admitting the facts of the crime, then write an article based on that, elaborating on it, saying a few words of reflection, expressing remorse, and, as usual, use the standard formula of "I used to mistake a thief for my father," "Now I have awakened," "I will never commit the crime again." Then tell these words to the person and have him memorize them. If there has been no confession of guilt, regardless of whether it is unjust or not, you can simply admit the crime forcefully, make up some facts if there are none, and if there are accomplices, just make contact with them secretly beforehand. Anyway, "We'll talk after we get out," to avoid "dragging out the imprisonment."</p>
<p>This inmate's confession was indeed a bit difficult to write, not because he couldn't recognize Chinese characters. When telling lies in a confession, you must be able to justify yourself, otherwise the "mask" will be revealed, and the person interviewing you from the reformatory will see through it, and you will definitely not be "transferred." His situation was difficult to explain satisfactorily. There were seven people involved in his case. Besides a barber inmate who always shaved him until he was shiny, there was also an English teacher, a merchant, a university student, and a painter. With so many parties involved, the relationships were naturally complicated, and it was impossible to fabricate events out of thin air like in a single case. His charge was "communication," because he transported books that were used for propaganda. However, according to him, he really didn't know the truth of the matter at first:</p>
<p>"We people on the ship bring things to earn extra money. How would we know if it's the XX Party or not?"</p>
<p>He said it frankly and naturally.</p>
<p>The person who asked him to carry the books had said in court that he had not joined any organization. He himself denied the crime outright. But this was worse than admitting the crime, because it was said that he was not reflecting and he was sentenced to five years in prison. Those who admitted the crime were considered to have repented and had their sentences reduced by half, and they were only sentenced to two and a half years. The person who asked him to carry the books had committed suicide, secretly tearing open his suit trousers and hanging himself in the middle of the night, so there was no proof.</p>
<p>"People who haven't joined an organization, of course, wouldn't tell him the real situation!"</p>
<p>Many old inmates said this. Therefore, it was impossible for him to change his story and admit the crime. Not admitting the crime, however, could not be considered a confession, and this became a stalemate.</p>
<p>Later, I was transferred to a different cell, and separated from him. I transferred to a small cell on the east side, and he remained in the large cell in the center. However, I could still see him often in the workshop.</p>
<p>"How do you write a confession?" Every time we met, after greeting each other, he would ask me this question first, as usual. If the conversation went on for more than five sentences, he would have to ask again:</p>
<p>"How do you write a confession?"</p>
<p>Originally, I had already memorized his name very well, and I could even say his number off the top of my head. Because he was always asking me this question, if you didn't understand him, it was hard not to find him annoying. After going to the workshop, as long as I saw him in the distance, I would always think to myself: "The confession is coming!"</p>
<p>Gradually, I forgot his real name and no longer remembered his number, and just treated him as a confession.</p>
<h3>End of the Year</h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>Carrying heavy steps,</p>
<p>Silently treading through another difficult year.</p>
<p>Still in a helpless,</p>
<p>Situation, reaching New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>As usual, the broken mood of the year,</p>
<p>Will be brought to an end on this day of the year.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the new year,</p>
<p>Hoping that the weariness of life will follow,</p>
<p>This difficult year to pass.</p>
<p>Why look back?</p>
<p>Those countless sorrows and hatreds,</p>
<p>Under the poor and difficult life,</p>
<p>There are light dreams to tease my mind,</p>
<p>But how dare I have the infatuation of a poet,</p>
<p>Adding another layer of heartache memories.</p>
<p>Those past events that pierced my heart,</p>
<p>Pass away with the cold winter wind.</p>
<p>Still a lonely state of mind,</p>
<p>Dazed to see the year pass.</p>
<p>But I still have to live,</p>
<p>To steadfastly resist poverty,</p>
<p>Resist the loneliness of the heart.</p>
<p>Continue to climb through the long and difficult road,</p>
<p>And hope for tomorrow!</p>
<p>So I shake off my tired spirit,</p>
<p>Stretch out my lazy body.</p>
<p>Firmly waving my fist,</p>
<p>Forcing a smile,</p>
<p>Opening my arms to welcome the new year.</p>
<h3>Birandello as a Playwright</h3>
<p>— Lü Gang</p>
<p>December 10, Havas Rome Electric: "Luigi Pirandello, the famous Italian playwright and novelist, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1934, passed away this morning at eight o'clock due to pneumonia..." This news does not seem to attract much attention. However, Pirandello cannot be considered an unfamiliar writer in China. Perhaps it is because he once acted as an "accomplice," willing to serve Mussolini on the battlefield, declaring his readiness to go to East Africa to conquer Abyssinia, that everyone lost interest? ... However, in any case, his artistic achievements and influence cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>In fact, Pirandello is not a "genuine" fascist writer. Some say he is a liberal, but I don't think that is quite right. In short, he seems to be a "late convert" who leans towards fascism. However, Nicolas Ferretti has another view, saying that he is a skeptical poet. Naturally, he has his reasons. For example, he said: "...In Pirandello's eyes, the land of fascism only increases the soul's suffering, misfortune, and failure due to the feeling of emptiness in life." "Therefore, the certainty explored by the characters described by Pirandello becomes elusive; this gives rise to doubt, confusion, distress, and disappointment." But in fact, Ferretti's statement can almost be said to be based on a psychological point of view. However, it does not seem appropriate to criticize and observe Pirandello's entire work or his artistic development process from this point of view alone, because his mind—his ideals—still exist within his art.</p>
<p>Pirandello's thoughts were limited to the society and environment in which he lived, so Ferretti said: "Everyone has their own truth" is the title of several plays: this is Pirandello's entire philosophy." This is very true. Moreover; this also explains what Pirandello's thoughts are expressed in these plays? ... Therefore, "Pirandello's thoughts are full of many distresses, and are integrated with the sophists, Protagoras, Gorgias, or Hume's thoughts, or Hegel's doctrine that is being mutually interpreted." The result of this thought also has a source: he was confined by the "spiritual prison" of fascism, and his artistic boundaries were limited. "He cannot run outside the boundaries of 'nature,' and is trapped in disappointment or great natural distress."</p>
<p>Long-term doubt and distress, as well as despair of not finding a way out, finally made him trust in God. — This is naturally the tragedy of the human spirit under fascism.</p>
<p>— Forget yourself: Believe in God.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that Pirandello ended up like this. He cannot see the world, and even if he has glimpsed some "small world," he does not dare to express it in his works. Ferretti said that in "his works, he always carefully avoids direct descriptions of historical and social environments." — This is indeed a sad fact. As a result, he can only forever describe psychological conflicts and always explore the truth within the soul. ... Sometimes, his artistic works depict the psychology of two eras, as well as social contradictions. But this was mostly before the war. Often in his works you can see a terrible psychological expression: the result is anger and madness. ... This is most evident in his plays, because the characters in his plays are mostly tormented by the most complex and contradictory psychology, just as his own thoughts are trapped. ...</p>
<p>Some people think that his drama is an "ideal drama," perhaps because he expressed his ideals and his entire philosophy. ... In his entire life, it seems that his achievements in drama are greater than his achievements in poetry or poetry. And the starting point of his literary life seems to have been first engaged in the creation of poetry.</p>
<p>He is worthy of being a talented poet, playwright and novelist. He was born in Cirgenli on June 28, 1867, his hometown is Sicily. In 1891, he graduated from Bouo University in Germany, and then served as a professor of rhetoric and aesthetics at the Higher Women's Academy of the Roman Church from 1897 to 1924. On March 18, 1929, he was appointed by the government as a member of the "Italian Academy of Letters." During this period, he also engaged in literary writing. Before the war, he had already achieved considerable artistic success. At that time, he mostly wrote novels. In addition to the twenty-four volumes of "One Year's Short Stories" that have been collected, his novels include: "The Excluded Woman" written in 1901, "The Late Mattia Pascal" written in 1912, "Old and Young" written in 1931, "Transformed" written in 1916, and "One, No One, and One Hundred Thousand" ... and so on. His play writing was mostly later. And his later years were mostly spent writing plays. The play collection "Naked Masks" includes almost more than forty plays. Here are: "Glorious Leisure" (1918), "The Game of Duty (1918), "Everyone Has Their Own Truth" (1918), "But This Is Not a Serious Matter" (1919), "Like Before, Yet Better Than Before" (1921), "Six Characters in Search of an Author" (1921), "Henry IV" 1922), "Clothing the Naked" (1923), "Each in His Own Way" (1924), "The Doctor's Duty" (1926), "New Colony" (1928), "Tonight We Improvise" (1922), "As You Desire Me" (1932), "Existence" (1932), "When Someone is a Character" (1933). ...etc. Among them, "New Colony" made a strict critique of fascism, naturally, this is certainly not enough to prove Pirandello's opposition to fascism. Ferretti put it well: "The world illusion based on Pirandello's work can very well promote the Italian bourgeoisie to engage in organizing fascist dictatorship." But if we therefore say that he is promoting fascism, or conversely that he is anti-fascist, then it is completely incorrect. Therefore, it is indeed difficult to affirm the facts; he is a "thorough" fascist figure, and it is therefore no wonder that he was attacked by Marinetti - a fascist futurist writer - at the Vienna International Congress for saying that art should not be used as a political tool. It is even less surprising that fascist critics consider his art to be "immoral" art and remove the play "The Myth of Inherited Children" from the program of the Royal Opera House. ... Now that he is finally dead, it seems to be the time to "cover the coffin."</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Nights</h3>
<h3>Literary Supplement Notice</h3>
<p>Last year, this publication published a manuscript of "Jiangbei People". The original intention of this article was to satirize the people of Jiangnan who have a very deep regional concept. The words "seemingly think that they are Jiangnan people..." in the article are clear evidence of this. This article does not insult the people of northern Jiangsu. I am afraid that it will cause misunderstanding. I hereby declare and apologize.</p>

<h3>Huge Amount of Dried Cocoons Loaded for Export</h3>
<p>— Jian Ping</p>
<p>We just loudly appealed for silk factories that were "out of raw materials" and "forced to stop production," but we actually saw on the news that a huge amount of dried cocoons were being loaded for export. This is undoubtedly a very painful thing.</p>
<p>The local news section of this newspaper on the 6th revealed the following piece of news:</p>
<p>"While the silk factories in our province are being forced to stop production one after another due to lack of raw materials, British firm Jardine Matheson, Swiss firm Reinner, Italian firm Dafeng, etc., suddenly announced that they would buy high-quality cocoons from our country, declare them for export, and transport them to Italy, Switzerland, France, and other places. The purchase price has been particularly increased. For example, high-quality cocoons with a silk reeling yield of over 350 catties are priced at about 250 yuan in national currency per dan of dried cocoons. It is heard that more than 1,000 dan of dried cocoons have been declared for export. The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association convened an emergency meeting and decided to: send a letter to the Jianghai Customs to investigate the number of exports and tax rates; submit a request to the municipal government to quickly find ways to stop it, or forward it to the financial authorities to increase export tax rates. Also, after investigating the reasons for the exports, there are various rumors. Some say that they are used as industrial raw materials, while others say that they are used to make munitions (such as gunpowder)."</p>
<p>Last year, we already felt that the forced shutdown of silk factories was a most hateful thing. This year, only at the beginning, the evening paper on the 3rd published shocking news: "Lack of raw materials, high market prices, silk factories are mostly closed. Of the 113 factories in the city, only 48 were operating last year, and there are currently less than 20. These 20 are expected to stop production during the lunar New Year." It can be seen that this phenomenon is deteriorating. Without a perfect solution, it will never be reversed. Regarding this issue, the author pointed out in "Talk" on December 22 last year that this is also a "man-made conspiracy." At that time, the understanding of this issue was that it was not simply because of the "autumn cocoon harvest" that led to a lack of raw materials, but it was actually because "spring cocoon inventory was being hoarded by unscrupulous merchants." Now, the facts have proven that this is not "slander."</p>
<p>On the one hand, "silk factories are being forced to stop production due to lack of raw materials," but on the other hand, "huge amounts of dried cocoons are being loaded for export." This cannot be admitted to be a "good phenomenon." Originally, in our country under colonial status, exchanging raw materials for finished goods was already a forced thing. If we want to avoid being manipulated, of course, we have to break the shackles that others have prepared for us. Now, the facts provide a good example for our national industrialists. Of course, the industrialists in the silk factory industry, who are at the forefront, should clearly recognize this matter, and other industrialists should also "mourn for the fox after the rabbit dies." Everyone should wake up and work hard from basic work to achieve our requirements.</p>
<p>For example, the remedial measures decided by the Silk Factory Trade Association this time, requesting to "stop" exports and "increase export tax rates," require that our country not be bullied by imperialism. At the same time, for the general "hoarding and speculation" unscrupulous merchants, our national industrialists should fully expose their "traitor faces" and use the collective power to "sanction" them. "It is better to ask for yourself than to ask for others." Our national industrialists should concentrate their strength under the slogan of "national defense first," which is enough to deal with and destroy all tyrannical forces.</p>
<p>Finally, we should pay more attention to the fact that although it is not fully verified, it is "possible" that the huge amount of dried cocoons being loaded for export is to supply others with the manufacture of munitions. On the one hand, they buy at high prices, destroying our weak national industry; on the other hand, they manufacture munitions to guarantee their victory in aggression. We think: in the face of the covetous gaze of the great powers (especially our nation's greatest enemy), we Chinese are such a pitiful little beast!</p>

<h3>On the Snowy Plains</h3>
<p>— Zhang Hai</p>
<p>The vast, boundless plains, as flat as a sea, stretched out at the foot of Dokbo Mountain. No trees could be seen, no villages, no Mongolian yurts or herds of livestock, and no color of the earth. From the cloud formations to the mountain ranges, as far as the eye could see, everything was covered with a layer of melting, glittering white snow, a vast expanse of whiteness, as if an angel had scattered velvet across the universe, trying to conceal the turbidity of the mortal world. On this pure snowfield, it was so desolate that even birds and beasts had disappeared, and the world had completely transformed into simplicity and solitude.</p>
<p>The camel's heavy hooves trampled relentlessly on the snow, the trampled snow marks gradually lengthening behind it. Bayar hadn't slept last night, and at this moment he kept yawning, his head drooping, his eyes unable to stay open. For a long time, I hadn't paid attention to him; it was the only camel bell that could awaken the snowfield that attracted me. Its tune was even and rhythmic, an incomparable sound in the wilderness.</p>
<p>"Bayar, how much further to Daqingshan?"</p>
<p>"After crossing Eqi Balu Mountain ahead, we'll reach the Dalat Desert, and further south is Daqingshan. But it will take us another four or five days to reach Pingdi Spring."</p>
<p>Bayar is a Mongolian, belonging to the "Khalkha" tribe. Three years ago, when I took a detour through Inner and Outer Mongolia to Siberia, I met him in Munisi. He gave me a fox skin the color of old sugar, wishing that I would stay in his home forever. This time, I was going to Xikang, and unexpectedly encountered him again while passing through Sayut.</p>
<p>"Mongolians all want to fight the short devils [Japanese], even the lamas are so angry they can't stand it!" He said to me excitedly as we slept in fur blankets at night.</p>
<p>At this moment, the two of us were carrying fifty sheepskin coats donated by herders from the Sayut area, sending them far away to the national warriors in Suidong.</p>
<p>The sun of severe winter, like a person suffering from paralysis, showed no sign of struggling. The frozen clouds always obstructed her, played with her, and simply let anything bully her. The snow hardly melted at all in the sun, but a violent storm rushed fiercely from the distant desert, roaring wildly, stirring up cold currents relentlessly in the vast snowfield, solidifying snow particles, and defeating the weak and powerless sunlight. Gradually, the ground bulged up here and there, and sank down here and there, making it clear that snow ridges were about to rise on this white snowfield.</p>
<p>Snow particles, along with the wind and waves, swept against our noses, against the camels' heads and necks. Bayar's camel suddenly lay down, almost throwing him off. He dismounted, seemingly unconcerned, whipped the camel, and rode on again.</p>
<p>As we approached the foot of Eqi Balu Mountain, he repeatedly instructed me:</p>
<p>"There are often bandits on the mountain ahead who catch people and cut off their ears and scoop out their soles! I heard that people from ×× have even come here to take photos, I don't know what they're using them for. We have to be especially careful, if we run into bandits, we're finished. They all have new weapons, given to them by ××."</p>
<p>Although his face was hidden in his sheepskin hat, so I couldn't see his expression, I believed that he was harboring vigilance, and that the blood in his body must be circulating rapidly. He prayed on the camel's back:</p>
<p>"May Heaven bless us to deliver these things safely to those brothers!"</p>
<p>It wasn't until our camels stepped onto the Dalat Desert that Bayar recovered his peace of mind from the fear, and lightly, incessantly, sucked on his pipe.</p>
<p>The wind and snow fought endlessly.</p>
<h3>Cabbage</h3>
<p>— Liao Chuxiu</p>
<p>In recent days, cabbage has become a rather fashionable vegetable. In Shanghai, it is bought and sold by the load or by the catty. What Mr. Lu Xun said, "Hanging under the eaves of fruit stores, sold by the rain, used as a lining for shark fin soup," refers only to a type of Tianjin cabbage.</p>
<p>The Qunfang Pu and Shu Pu state: "Cabbage, also called song, is the most suitable vegetable for regular consumption among all vegetables. There are two types, one with a round, thick, slightly green stem, and the other with a flat, thin, and white stem. The leaves are all pale greenish-white, and the seeds are like those of rapeseed, but gray-black. It is planted in August, and blooms with yellow flowers in February, with four petals like mustard flowers. It forms pods in March, also like mustard. The ones grown in Yan, Zhao, Liaoyang, and Huaiyang are the fattest and thickest, with a single head weighing more than ten catties. Those in the south overwinter in the fields, while those in the north are mostly put in cellars. Gardeners in Yanjing also use horse manure in cellars to mound and cultivate them, keeping them out of the wind and sun, so that they grow out with tender yellow seedlings and leaves, crisp, beautiful, and without dregs, called yellow bud cabbage, which is a different variety of cabbage. The stems and leaves are all flat, with a sweet, warm, and non-toxic taste, which benefits the intestines and stomach, removes chest upset, relieves alcohol soup, promotes urination and defecation, harmonizes the middle and stops coughs, and winter juice is especially good. Before the summer solstice, the cabbage resembles boxes, and can treat skin itching and prevent qi-related diseases. There is also the spring never-old, also called eight-catty cabbage, with leaves like cabbage but larger, very crisp and tender, which can be planted in all four seasons and is very good for pickling."</p>
<p>The Pi Ya says: "The nature of song is to not wither in winter, and it is always available in all four seasons, with the integrity of pine, hence its character is ideographic." This is probably the reason why cabbage is called song.</p>
<p>The Ben Cao says: "The fattest and largest is called cow belly song." The Cai Pu says: "There is spring song and late song." Therefore, in the Biography of Zhou Yong in the Book of Southern Qi: "Yong was poor and had few desires, and ate vegetables all his life. Prince Wenhui asked Yong, what is the best taste among vegetables? He immediately said: Early chives in early spring, late song in late autumn." The early chives of early spring naturally refer to the chive sprouts of the present, and the superiority of late song over spring song is also evident from this.</p>
<p>Cabbage has probably been a common food for commoners for a long time. Therefore, the ancients always used eating song to express frugality. Biography of Prince Wuling Zhao in the Book of Southern Qi: "Shangshuling Wang Jian visited Ye, and Ye kept Jian for a meal, which was just cabbage and abalone in the dish."</p>
<p>In fact, cabbage is not one of the best-tasting vegetables. Chive sprouts, spinach, and shepherd's purse are above it, but its taste is quite "moderate," and there is a lot of it, so people eat it often. In fact, there are also people who hate cabbage:</p>
<p>Qing Yi Lu: "Jiangyou has a lot of song cabbage, and those who cook it with bamboo shoots hate it, scolding it: 'Heart-eating vegetable, slave and concubine of asparagus and mushrooms.'" Although this is because there is too much cabbage for those who cook bamboo shoots, which抢了the bamboo shoots' market, compared with bamboo shoots, cabbage is really only in the position of a slave; not to mention comparing it with fragrant mushrooms.</p>
<p>"After a great war, there must be a famine," this is what Lao Tzu said. However, cabbage is not like that. After a great war, it is not "scarce" like other vegetables, but grows extra long.</p>
<p>Zhuo Geng Lu records: "Between Yangzhou and Wang Bingshen Dingyou, after the ravages of war, the sites of houses in the city were covered with cabbage, the large ones weighing more than fifteen catties, and the small ones were no less than eight or nine catties, with laborers carrying only four or five heads." However, this statement is not necessarily correct. Currently, war is raging everywhere, but cabbage does not seem to be growing extraordinarily large compared to before.</p>
<p>Xie Zhaozhi's Wang Za Zhi says: "In the capital, there is yellow bud cabbage and yellow chives in the depths of winter, which are grown in fire pits in cellars by wealthy families, and the poor cannot afford them." Then, the so-called yellow bud cabbage must be called that only when it is "grown from fire pits and cellars" and "the seedlings and leaves turn yellow." Currently, people in Jiangnan call all cabbage yellow bud cabbage.</p>
<p>In fact, cabbage is better to play with than to eat. Currently, some people in Shanghai grow "red and purple song cabbage" in pots, which is naturally extremely vulgar. However, what Shen Sanbai's Six Records of a Floating Life records: "The heart of yellow bud cabbage is as white as jade, take five or seven heads of various sizes, plant them in a rectangular pot with sand and soil, and use charcoal instead of stone, with clear black and white, which is quite interesting." It is really better than daffodils, etc.</p>
<p>Regarding specialized writings on song cabbage, the earliest is Liang Jianwendi's Xie Chi Lai Da Song Qi, which says: "Wu is ashamed of the honor of a thousand miles, and Shu is ashamed of the Fu of Seven Vegetables, knowing that breaking celery in the school palace is just entering the Lu poetry, and cooking mallows with flowing fire is just specializing in the Bin classic." This greatly praises cabbage.</p>
<p>Finally, I must further clarify that the vegetables mentioned by the ancients all refer to cabbage, and that all writings about cabbage always include what the ancients said about vegetables in them. As for me, I naturally cannot but be cautious and only record some writings that explain song cabbage.</p>
<h3>The Sorrow of the Yu Cheng Boss</h3>
<p>— Jiang Tian</p>
<p>The Yu Cheng Old Shop, which owns more than a dozen porcelain kilns and has more than a dozen branches in various places, is the largest porcelain manufacturing company in Gaopo Town. Everyone knows that the Yu Cheng boss (Cantonese for 'owner') is the most capable person in business.</p>
<p>The Yu Cheng boss is already around fifty years old this year, but his ambition to run a business has not waned. He still says from time to time: "Although our products here can't always catch up with those of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi, and our reputation is not as great as theirs, based on my experience of the past twenty or thirty years, I think we will be able to catch up with them sooner or later, won't we? Now, in the southern regions and various parts of Southeast Asia, aren't our products very popular and reputable?"</p>
<p>Indeed, the Yu Cheng boss is a person with great business ambitions. The Gaopo porcelain industry has achieved its present success, and the Yu Cheng boss is definitely a meritorious figure. Twenty or thirty years ago, there were only a few very small porcelain kilns in this town, producing only some crude plates and bowls, which were sold only in nearby villages. However, the Yu Cheng boss believed that this business had potential, so he devoted his efforts to it, selling some ancestral fields to raise money to open new kilns. Gradually, he opened branches in various places, and the products became more diverse. As long as it was porcelainware, he produced it, and sales gradually increased. Other shops in the town also followed suit and sought development. In this way, ten years ago, Gaopo porcelain was already being sold to Southeast Asia. Everyone knew that Gaopo was a famous porcelain-producing area in South China, and the Yu Cheng boss, who developed this business, had become the richest man in the town. Not to mention anything else, just the number of people who relied on his porcelain kilns for their livelihoods was in the thousands, and the name Yu Cheng was known to those who bought porcelain. Yu Cheng plates and bowls were as famous as Chen Jiageng shoes.</p>
<p>The Yu Cheng boss was so good at business that it was no wonder he often boasted that he would run Gaopo porcelain to be as famous as Jingdezhen in Jiangxi. However, in recent years, the sales of Gaopo porcelain have changed a bit. Stacks and stacks of inventory are piled up everywhere, especially sales in Southeast Asia, which have simply disappeared.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is distressing to the Yu Cheng boss. He can only scold the fellow bosses from time to time:</p>
<p>"Damn it, it's all those Japanese devils who sell the goods at a lower price to take away our sales. And there are those worthless Chinese who go to buy them. Those foreign goods aren't durable, they're just a little better-looking. We can only sell the inventory cheaper now. I think foreign goods won't last long."</p>
<p>The Yu Cheng boss thought that selling the inventory cheaper would defeat foreign goods, but foreign goods were even cheaper. Finally, the inventory still couldn't be sold, and batches of new goods were stored up again. In this kind of situation, several fellow businesses in the town had already closed down, but the Yu Cheng boss, who had a lot of capital, was not afraid and continued to produce as usual. However, one year was ultimately not as good as the previous year. The branches in various places all said that there was too much inventory and they couldn't produce any more. Even Jiangxi goods couldn't compete with foreign goods. This is what made the Yu Cheng boss anxious. Looking at the end of this year, the porcelain kilns in the town</p>
<p>Continued on Page 5</p>

<h2>Page 18</h2>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>all had to stop work.</p>
<p>The Yu Cheng boss ran to the warehouses by the river every day, looking at the goods in the warehouses, which were piling up more and more. Those red-headed wooden boats on the river, which used to transport his porcelain goods to the outside world, were now either empty and parked by the river, or loaded with cabins full of rice. This situation made him think that foreign goods were not as good as his?</p>
<p>Inventory was everywhere. The Yu Cheng boss could only sit on the rosewood pit bed in the living room all day, smoking his water pipe and stroking his beard, thinking. Finally, he had no choice but to stop the work of the porcelain kilns. He said to the workers:</p>
<p>"Now it's because there are no sales, too much inventory, so we have to stop the kilns. This is all due to the dumping of foreign goods. Once sales turn better, we will still open the kilns. I really want you to work."</p>
<p>The Yu Cheng boss looked at the disappointed faces of the workers, looking at the porcelain kilns without a trace of fire, and he also felt sad. However, he was still thinking in his heart: "Maybe foreign goods will decline one day." However, this was just comforting his sad mood. How can such indigenous products that are not improved compete with foreign goods? Perhaps the Yu Cheng boss and those fellow people had not thought of this.</p>

<h3>Afternotes P] The Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications (1300) will have Mr. Gu Bangji and Mr. Xu Hongji of Daxia University lecture on "Words on Raising Children" from 4:30 PM to 5:15 PM this afternoon. All circles are requested to pay attention at that time. A Visit to the Film "Drama Workshop" "Sunrise" Is Not Difficult to Produce Not long ago, major newspapers in this city published the news that the "Drama Workshop" was rehearsing "Sunrise," and invited the famous playwright Ouyang Yuqian to serve as the director of the play. Since this news came out, not only were general drama-loving audiences watching with great interest, but also the literary world caused considerable attention. Because the script of "Sunrise" is the recent creation of Mr. Cao Yu, which has been published in the Wen Ji Monthly, Mr. Cao's first work is "Thunderstorm," and his achievements have won praise from all sides, considering him to be the most recent outstanding Chinese playwright. Therefore, after the news of his second creation "Sunrise" being prepared for performance was revealed, Mao Dun, Ba Jin, Ye Shaojun, Shen Congwen and many other famous writers in the literary world published a special issue in the local Ta Kung Pao, making a collective critique of "Sunrise," unanimously praising it and considering it to be an even more successful step forward than "Thunderstorm." Therefore, all the audiences who have seen "Thunderstorm" on stage are looking forward to the early performance of "Sunrise." But the day before yesterday, news came that "Sunrise" was difficult to produce. What exactly is the reason? It was not said. The reporter is a member of the drama-loving group, and after hearing this news, he made a special trip to the "Drama Workshop" for a visit. There, they were working hard to rehearse, and the working situation was very tense. He found a person in charge, Mr. So-and-so, and asked about the truth about the difficulty of producing "Sunrise." According to him, this is not really true. In fact, because most of the actors in the "Drama Workshop" are the backbone of the "Fudan Drama Society," and now because the winter vacation is approaching, all universities are preparing for the big exam, so some actors are busy with exams and cannot participate in rehearsals, so the work was virtually suspended for two or three days, so there was a misreport of difficult production news. Now they have stepped up their work and will probably be able to meet the audience soon. Drama-loving audiences! Are you looking forward to "Sunrise"? This news is good news. The Lianhua Giant Film "Lianhua Symphony" Premiered Last Night The Lianhua sound giant film "Lianhua Symphony," produced by Huaan Company, is a giant film jointly produced by all the stars of Lianhua's eight major directors. It was originally scheduled to premiere at the New Light Grand Theater on New Year's Day. Because another giant film of the company, "Lone City Heroine," was a great success, it was extended to premiere at 9:15 last night. (Three shows daily from today) The film includes eight parts, namely "Two Mao Money" directed by Situ Huimin, "Broken Dreams of a Spring Boudoir" directed by Fei Mu, "Stranger" directed by Tan Youliu, "Trio" directed by Shen Fu, "Moonlight Sketch" directed by He Mengfu, "Ghost" directed by Song Shilin, "Fools' Rhapsody" directed by Sun Yu, and "Little Five Righteous Ones" directed by Cai Chusheng. The content is rich and the technology is excellent. It is undoubtedly a giant film that audiences who love Lianhua films do not want to give up. Zuo Ming's "The Way to Make Money" Since the start of filming of "Mr. Wang's Way to Make Money," which was written and directed by Zuo Ming for the second time, it has been nearly three months. During the New Year, Zuo Ming received many New Year's cards from friends. Most of the words on the New Year's cards were different from the others, that is, after "Congratulations on the New Year," there was also a sentence "and wish the success of the way to make money," which is very obvious. On the one hand, they used this auspicious phrase "the way to make money," and on the other hand, they wished him the success of "Mr. Wang's Way to Make Money," which can be said to be a clever pun. Zuo Ming is loyal to art. He is concentrating on completing his "Mr. Wang's Way to Make Money" perfectly, so although it was the New Year, he only rested for two days, and then continued to work, and will soon be "completed." Daguangming Shows "Queen of the Beast Kingdom" Starting today, the Daguangming Grand Theater will show Paramount's all-out production of the beast film "Queen of the Jungle" The Jungle Princess. The protagonist of the film is the healthy and beautiful movie star Dorazan Lamore. Except for this film, it is feared that beast films with female stars as the protagonists have not been seen before. The content includes scenes such as thousands of apes attacking the village inhabited by the natives, the fierce battle between tigers and leopards, the cruel punishment of women by demon natives, and the nude swimming of romantic couples in the creek. Dorazan Lamore has the ability to drive elephants and tigers in this film, and has the beauty to sink fish and drop geese, so it is more interesting to watch than ordinary beast films without romantic colors. When the theater releases this film, it will also show the famous short film "Invincible Sailor," which won the gold medal. The film uses the latest invention of three-dimensional color, which is more beautiful and vivid than the three primary colors, it is said. 代邮 Ye Weihua: The news item was published on December 24 of last year, with the address of Du Aojun at No. 2954 Xiangyin Road, Jiangwan, because it is a promotional copy.
