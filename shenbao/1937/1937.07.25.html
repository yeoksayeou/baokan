<h3>中國救亡圖存的大道</h3>
<p>— 馮友蘭</p>
<p>據報載中國文化建設恊會首次會員代表大會，十一日閉幕後，十二日發表宣言，其要點之一是：“我國立國之本在農，故農業仍為我國增加生產之第一步驟。應由過去之純農業國家進而爲農工商共同發展之國家。”宣言原文，在北方尚未見到，我們姑且就這裏所引之簡單的幾句話，加以討論。</p>
<p>說到農業與工業的分別，只應就生產對象說：不應就生產方法或生產工具說。就生產對象說，農業只能是農業。就生產方法或生產工具說，農業也可以是工業，因為我們可以用機器耕種，作大規模的生產。凡是用機器以作大規模的生產者，我們都呌他作工業。用機器耕種，作大規模的生產，卽所謂農業之工業化。像美國及蘇聯，或者已經成為工業國，或者將要成為工業國，我們說他是工業國，只是就他們的生產方洗說。若就生產對象說，他們出產的農產品，也並不在少數。只就生產對象說，只要是天然環境允許，沒有一箇國家不願意作‘農工商共同發展之國家’。其只作工業國家者，實因其為天然環境所限制也。一個國家若沒有廣大肥沃的土地，他是不能有農業的。但若就生產方法說，則卽無所謂‘農工商共同發展之國家’，因為農業也工業化了，就生產方法說，農業工業卽無分別。至於商並不是一種生產的制度，不能與農工並論。</p>
<p>中國文化建設恊會所謂‘農工商共同發展之國家’，大概必是就生產對象說，這本是無可非議的。不過一般人往往有未將農業與工業之分別弄淸楚者，以為無論在任何方面，農業與工業總是對立的，因之往往引起許多誤會。又有人惑於‘我國以農立國’之說，以為我們似乎可以不要工業，或不要很多的工業。為破除這些錯誤，所以我願於此點再加說明。</p>
<p>我們常聽見有人替我們提出一種經濟提携的辦法。照這個辦法中國是農業國，只向農業方面發展。他們是工業國，只向工業國發展。中國以農業產品，換他們的工業產品︰他們以工業產品，換中國的農業產品。如此互相交換，兩方在經濟上卽可合作而不衝突。經濟上無衝突，則別種衝突，自然卽沒有了。照‘我國以農立國’論者的觀點，此辦法亦未嘗不似乎‘持之有故，言之成理。’但如眞照這個辦法去作，試想中國成爲什麼樣子。中國眞成為人家的原料供給者及生產消費者。一個國家的原料供給者及一個國家的生產消費者正是一個國家的，不折不扣，十足道地的殖民地。近代强國對於弱小民族的政治的武力的壓制，其最後目的，無非是想呌弱小民族永久是他的原料供給者及生產消費者。我們近來常析見歐洲有些國家要求殖民地重新分配，或原料重新分配，二者是二名一實。</p>
<p>我們要想不為殖民地，我們非急起直追，趕緊工業化不可。我們所怕者是別人不准我們工業化。我們自己千萬不可感於什麼‘我國以農立國’之說，對於工業化起些無謂的懷疑恐懼。其實我們只要工業化了，我們的農業自然會增加生產的。世界上只有純農業國，因水旱天災而常鬧饑荒．沒有聽說一個工業國的人，會比純農業國的人，更沒有飯吃。</p>
<p>再進一步說，卽使工業化眞有許多毛病，我們也非要他不可。因爲在現在的世界中，非工業的國家，除了當殖民地外，是無路可走的。</p>
<p>我們拿戰爭來作例。我們現在常聽見說到戰爭，可是似乎很少人注意到，在現在世界裏，一個非工業的國家是不配談正式大規模的戰爭的。戰爭必須用工具，猶之乎經濟生產必須用工具。以前的戰爭工具是手工業式的；現在的戰爭工具是工業式的。這就是說，現在戰爭工具是機械化的，現在打仗不是用人，是用機器。大砲機關槍是機器；飛機唐克車也是機器。我當說封神榜一書，是最迷信的也是最料學的，他是最科學的，因為在他裏面打仗不是靠人，而且靠‘法寶’。他是最迷信的，因為在他裏面，法寶是從魔術來而不是從應用自然律來。不過，無論如何，現在戰事眞像封神榜中的戰事概了。這邊祭起一架飛機，那邊就也須祭起一架飛機，至少也須祭起許多高射跑彈。若使這邊祭起一個法寶，而那邊無法寶破他，則任你有千軍萬馬，也只好自認吃虧。試問這些法寶是怎樣來的？一個非工業國家往那裏弄這些法寶？</p>
<p>中國這幾年來，國力⺒在增長，這就是因爲中國現在是在工業化的路上走的。我們看見蘇聯因急速的工業化而成為世界强國。我們又看見日本近年來又發表了更進一步工業化的新大計劃。他大概恐怕蘇聯中國迎頭趕上，所以也從此根本上下手。這的確是根本。我們必須工業化才能解决中國的問題。我們現在的工業化，是建設現代國家，救亡圖存的一條大道，一條唯一的大道。</p>
<p>這條在道，因爲是唯一的，所以中國自淸末至現在，大致的看，有意無意的總是順着這條路走的。雖然有的時候岔入別途，但不久就轉回來，因為別的路都是斷港絕河，走了碰頭，自然會回來。不過因爲有時岔路，所以中國的工業化，比我們的隣居，就落後了。例如粵漢鐵路，淸末卽籌劃起，到現在才完成。這種工業落後，是中國受欺負的根本原因。</p>
<p>中山先生說行易知難，在這一點很可以証明。中國的工業化，可以說開始於淸末曾左李張諸人，但是工業化意義，我們現在才算看得淸楚、我們旣知其意義，則更加緊進行，迎頭趕上，切不可再有遲疑，以免一誤再誤。</p>
<p>徐旭生先生在四月十八日本報星期論壇裏，對於我有以下的批評。他說：‘他們主張中國現在惟一的問題，就是工業化的問題，那却未免倒果為因。對於自然界的興趣不濃厚，只注意於工業的改進，終不免於無源之水，‘其涸也，可立而待也。’徐先生似乎沒有了解我們的意思。我們並未說‘中國現在唯一的問題，就是工業化的間題。’我們只說中國唯一的出路是工業化。要想到這個出路，自然要有許多絛件，科學化亦卽是其一。工業化可以包涵科學化，而科學化則不能包涵工業化。因此我們只說工業化。</p>

<h3>未來世界經濟會議面觀（上）</h3>
<p>— 孝可</p>
<p>常此世界各國大量增加軍事預算，積極擴充軍倫的時侯，忽然國際間又聽到縮减軍備，召開各國經濟會議等等的宣傳，日內瓦國際聯盟會組織的軍縮會議委員會，的確在上月底曾經不聲不響的開過一次會議，事寶上毫無結果，那是早在人家意料之中。不過在另一方面，歐洲各同的政治家的視綫，卻多注視在美總統羅斯福身上，希望他首先倡議召集世界經濟會議，滿想在這個會議中，謀得世界各國經濟上的妥協，以和緩軍備的競爭。我們就這次美總統委派曾任裁軍曾議美國代表的台維斯來歐，參加國際糖業會議及英王加冕典禮的用意看來，也許就是一個召集世界經濟會議的預兆吧。</p>
<p>實際上，我們知道自從希德勒開始發狂似的擴張軍備以來，他在德國民衆前，公然宣稱，大砲可以代替牛油，煤炭可以變成麵包，這種標語，一時固然迷醉了民衆，使他們忍受政府大量的榨取汗血，去支持軍擴的支出。但是另一方面，希德勒的整軍政策，卻使他的鄰邦不得不捲入這個擴軍的漩渦，法國本年度的預算，不得不發行國防公債一〇•五〇〇•〇〇〇•〇〇〇法郎，去填補預算表上特種國防費的出超，這便是希德勒擴軍政策的一個反響•英國則更因意大利侵佔阿比西尼後，英國在地中海所處的優勢，為之變，赴印度的航路，尸然感受到意大利的威脅，故不得不毅然繼法國之後，以一•四〇〇•〇〇〇•〇〇○鎊（一千六百萬萬法郎）的巨額款項，分五年重整其軍備，（內中四萬鎊，則發行公債向民間借貸），素稱頂算平衡的英國財政，也因特種預算支出的結果，變成出超了。講到德國對於軍事費的支山，一向被認為是國家的一種祕密，並不公佈。然而我們單從他的借款發行額上，已右證明其擴充軍備的程度，他在去年度共借了五•〇〇〇•〇〇〇•〇〇〇馬克，（約四百萬萬法郎），其中二十三萬萬馬克為公債，其飲的則用信用膨張的方法，發行一無金準備的紙馬克來補充，德國目前這種員險的財政政策，全藉有神祕手腕的經濟部長兼德意志鑲行總裁沙赫特博士以及國社黨的嚴厲政策，才能夠這樣勉強的支持下去。</p>
<p>歐洲大陸各國的軍備擴充，以及英國大規模的重整軍備政策通過於議院後，國際市塲上，軍需工業所必需的五金價格，均受其影響，而陸績高漲，今特錄倫敦的市價比較表如下：</p>
<p>我們推斷世界五金價格的暴漲，其中一部份的原因，雖說為投機家乘機操縱所致，但消費量的增加，以透市塲上求過於供，這當然為主要原因。世界主要鋼產國為美國，自歐洲軍備競爭實施後，Anaoonda股票，在羅斯福走人白宮之始，價值不足五美元，現一漲而逹五十元。祇三月份一月中，英國向美國定購四千至廠千萬元的巨量的鋼鐵。故美總統宣稱：世界五金價格的直升，而工資的高漲連緩，則繁榮（Boom）之後，必有恐慌（Krach）此種現象的補救，在於歐洲。由此更可見軍備競爭的危機了。法國因據充軍備之故，財政的維持，已屬萬分不易，據內閣總理萊翁勃倫報告：凡國庫收入一百法郎，其中四十二法郎，為還付公債之用，二十七法郎則用於军需，尚餘三十一法郎，則用於其他一切政费。当记者發此稿時，萊翁勃倫內阁，且因財政問題已實行辭職了，德國則对於軍需所用一切的一金，不准浪費外，現已缺少鐵料，故戈林將軍不得不開始限止別種工業對於鐵料的用途矣。</p>
<p>軍備所需的五金，其價格日益向上高漲，已為我人所熟知，但為世人所重視，以創造信用，象徴富足的黃金，則反因供過於求，而發生恐慌。現將世界的黃金產量，近年來有增無已的現象，列表如下：</p>

<h3>台維斯杯决賽前夕美國十年來之回憶</h3>
<p>預測美國之勝利者為五與一之比</p>
<p>中央社伦敦廿四日路透電、美國今日將與英国作台杯却令治賽、以定錦標誰屬、相信美國勝利者為五興一之比、蓋本年英國陣容極為柔弱、决難當鋒芒畢露之美國隊也美國隊將以惠勃爾登冠軍勃琪為主將、第一單打則為派克、雙打由勃奇與梅谷配搭充任、當德美兩國舉行帶際决賽時、美國之第二單打、原為格蘭脫、但格氏殊不景氣、兩戰兩北、大失衆望、故此次遂以派克代之、吾人當能憶及本年惠勃爾登男子單打比賽時、勃琪勢如破竹、攫取錦標、僅派克能於半决賽中勝彼一盤而已、是以派克之實力、實較格蘭脫爲充沛、</p>

<p>美國最後一次得台杯錦標、係一九二六年之事、彼時美國已連續保持該盃達七年之久、至一九二七年法國四騎士（拉谷斯脫•柯顯•鮑羅脫拉•勃魯能）始將美國擊敗、而將台杯携渡大西洋而去、自此以後、美國會有六次進達决賽週、但奪回該杯之願、迄未得償、</p>

<p>至一九二七年、法國選手技衛竿頭日進、第一單打拉谷斯脫擊敗瓊斯敦與鐵爾登、第二單打柯顯雖敗於鐵爾登、但戰勝瓊斯敦、雙打鮑羅脫拉與勃魯能、亦劇戰五盤、擊退鐵爾敦與亨透云、（按一九三三年英國擊收法國、奪得台杯、直保持至今年、）</p>

<h3>一九三七年惠勃爾登網球大會十二</h3>
<p>— 本報駐歐記者列山</p>
<p>第十日</p>
<p>今天女子單打比賽的結果、波蘭傑士喬斯卡女士、以直落兩盤勝美國馬蒲耳女士、英國蘭特女士勝法國馬秀夫人也是兩盤、馬蒲耳女士與馬秀夫人的失敗、固然不無一些出乎意外、但戰勝的兩人今天的確有佳妙的表演、尤其是蘭特女士的擊法、大有錦標的姿態、</p>
<p>馬勃耳甘拜下風</p>
<p>馬蒲耳女士今天的失敗、正同計承基的敗於梅谷一樣、旣不能發輝自己長處、而自已的弱點又受制於敵人、不但她砲彈式的發球克服不掉傑士喬司卡女士、就上前攔網的武器、又因對方重量的抽球、難得有嘗試的機會結果只好以底綫抽球的方法破敵、以抽球的技衛來論、馬蒲耳女士自然不及傑士喬司卡女士、</p>
<p>雖然、我們看過這一塲比賽以後、才知道第一流女網球家擊球的分量、决不在於男子之下、傑士喬司卡女士的正手抽球是可怕的、球抽出後、綢拍好像都要裂開的樣子、她每擊出一妙球、觀衆無不異口同聲呌喊出來、記者聽到幾位觀衆不絕地在讚嘆道、‘這種擊球是一個女子嗎、同男子又有什麽分別’、</p>
<p>第一盤開賽後、馬蒲耳女士氣勢甚盛、雙方都應用反手抽球、但一遇機會馬蒲耳女士即上前攔網、因之得分較多、此數先為四比二、再為五比三、只差一點她即可擭勝這一盤、然而在這種緊要關頭、她顯然有些心慌、一再失去良機、平時她最有把握的攔網、也失去了效用、眼看五比五、六比六、終於反而以六比八的比數失敗、在這一塲劇戰中、她雖採用有效的戰略、利用對方反手抽球的弱點、但今天出人意外的、傑士喬司卡女士的反手抽球特別出色、沒有什麼破綻、這也算馬蒲耳女士的不幸、雖然、一般觀衆是覺得滿意的了、因為像這種精彩的網球戰、在惠勃爾登是輕易看見不到的、尤其是傑士喬司卡女士的名字、不容易發音、裁判員每報告她的名字時、總要引起觀衆一陣笑聲、後來裁判員連喊肅靜’、但那一位觀衆肯聽他的話大家想、傑士喬斯止（葉得利若夫司卡）這個名字有多少好玩、怎能禁止得住不笑、（一段插話—我國許承基的譯名、在英國人眼中也是一個謎、他照廈門方言譯成KhoSinKie、此次惠勃爾登名單上他又寫做S.K.Kho.、據蘭特女士說、當許承基興梅谷比賽時、一位英的老太太告訴她的同件說、（那是多麼可惜，選用位選甲遠從中國跑到這裏木自家人打目黨人’、這位老太太看不清梅谷的面貌、單聽裁判員的報告聲音、梅谷并一戈’、（許承基英文名的中化譯法）於是乎此認為梅谷也是中國人、</p>
<p>第二盤時、馬開耳玄士不及第一盤的有把搬、擊球的錯誤更多、傑士喬斯卡（葉得利若夫司卡）女士擊出的球分量更重、一種重量是記者生平第一次在一位女網球家身上看到的、雙方的比數先爲二此○、再為五比二、馬蒲耳女士在觀衆的惋惜聲中、再輸了這一盤、比數為六比一、傑士喬斯卡女士獲勝、得到了最後的女子單打決賽權、</p>
<p>▲郎特八面威風</p>
<p>接著就是蘭特女士與馬秀夫人登塲、照今天這一塲網球戰看來、蘭特支士無疑的是今年度的女子單打‘冷門’、她是一位全材的女綢球家、沒有什麼弱點、也許只反手抽球稍差一點、然而這不能成為她的致命傷、尤其是對付不能奔跑的馬秀夫人、救濟的方法更多、第一盤開賽後、幾乎是輪到誰發球誰輸、馬秀夫人曾以三比一的比數佔先、但迅速間即被蘭特女士趕上、比數反爲五比三、馬秀夫人接著不但也勝一局、而且在第十局時又差一點即成為五比五的比數、這時候觀衆都在替蘭特女士擔心、也許要同馬蒲耳女士．樣的命運有被對方趕上的危險、不過蘭特女士有豐富的作戰經騐、她比馬蒲耳女士冷靜得多了、以美妙的抽球終於勝了這一局、同時也勝了這一盤、比數爲六比四、</p>
<p>第二盤時、蘭特女士的擊球更能運用自如、幾乎球要到那裹去、她擊來無不得心應手、迅速間以二比○佔先、這時候忽因界綫員的誤呼、致馬秀夫人平空又多輪了一球、精神上自然更受打擊、此後馬秀犬人似乎無心戀戰、只求這一塲比賽從速了結、於是給果蘭特女士又以六比○的比數勝了第二盤、</p>
<p>男女雙打井混合雙打今天比賽的紹果、都將達到最後决賽的階段、唯一的意外的事情、就是去年女子雙打世界锦標史太默司女士與詹士女士、敗於英國另一對雙打金夫人與瑩特曼夫人手中、比數為一比六、五比七、史太默司女士病後擊球總沒有恢復常態、而今天詹士女士打得更壞、所以她們終於以直落兩盤受了淘汰、</p>

<p>調查採辦江西國磁</p>
<p>熊氏此次返國係採辦江四國瓷、及調查該地瓷業狀況、返國後即赴贛省、淹留二月之久、據其表示、江西磁器質料甚佳、勝於外國出品、惟式樣尚有須改進之處、本人在贛採辦大批瓷器、即擬運往星洲試銷、以後並擬源輸運赴新、星洲華僑衆多、莫不愛用國貨、將來國瓷南銷、當不成問題、尤其最近在贛省有光大瓷業公司之成立、以科擧方法製磁、增加產量、必改出品、實吾僑商之好消息云、</p>
<p>鼓勵國人赴星營商</p>

<p>華僑募捐共赴國難</p>
<p>熊氏在星迄今已達三十年、兼任江西同鄉會總理、對僑情極熟悉、談及華僑對祖國情形、據云、華僑在海外辛苦經營、其歸、宿與願望、即在祖國、南僑對國內一功建設、向能竭力贊助、威以“無國即無家”相驚楊、此次日人在蘆溝橋發生理變、實右憤恨、木人斯時已經返國、諒南洋華僑情緒必又甚緊張也、末記者詢及華僑募捐、遭星洲當局禁止事、熊談、根據過去經騐言、華僑為戰爭寡捐而遭禁阻者、固亦有之、但愛國情緒、仍熱烈鼓舞、故每次均由華僑自動捐助、不必有勸募形式表現、預料本次為抗敵募款、雖重遭禁阻、其成績必仍有可觀云、</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>麵粉出口　數量有問題　現銷已活躍</p>
<p>海關本月十六日奉財部令、禁止麺粉出口、因之一星期來、麺粉出口、已吿絕跡、前日（二十三）海關又接財部新訓令、對於禁止麺粉出口、另頒新辦法、“即除遼吉黑（東三省）連大連在內”、禁止運去外、其他各口岸、一律解禁等情、已誌昨報、各客帮得悉後、昨日紛紛向輪船公司報運、携單赴海關報出口、共有十餘萬包之譜、不料海關又宣佈、每日由滬出口限定爲四萬五千包、因之客家又起恐慌、乃要求加碼、海關答允請示上峯、今日因星期例假、故明日方可解决、今日已有出口者、計阜生輪八千包運津、新銘輪有二萬五十包運往福州、至聞此次新禁令內、尙有麩糠禁止運往外洋、素知該項麩糠以及豆餅屑、向來衹有日本需要、每年運去爲數驚人、他國從未聞採辦但今禁止後、日本當受相當影響也、</p>
<p>粉麥兩市之標準市塲、昨仍照限價開拍、一無變動、至現貨情形、已經做開、頗見活躍、因麺粉除三省及大連口岸以外、已可照常裝運、惟承銷之容戶、須用書柬具結、方能報運、麩皮一項、無論出口與轉口、依然禁運、故各廠方面、對現貨喊價、仍爲四元三角、猶無鬆動之勢、現小麥情形、中次仍平、高貨略見帶緊、開六合麥六元零五分、宣城麥六元零四分、東葛麥六元零九分、淮安麥六元零八分、次零三分、湘南麥五元九角一二分、無錫麥六元一角、及零九分、溫州麥六元、漢口大粒麥五元九角七分、揚州麥六元零五分、由福新辦六千包、申大辦一千包云</p>
<p>上海存米　約有四十八萬包</p>
<p>上海市在此非常時期內，最重要的準備工作，民食是否足數。此問題早已起注意，但結果照一般大量的估計，以爲本市存數，祇數兩月之用，而精確統計依然缺如，糧業界難有調查組織，亦無明文發表，刻下事實上即亟需要此項統計，以便大衆之參考，亦爲刻不容緩之舉，用特將調查所得本市各堆棧最近（二十三日）存米數量列后：</p>
<p>米業齊心不以資敵</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來貨共三千四五百石、本街銷塲仍鮮問津、故各貨成交無幾、容帮包胃僅靑島天津帮辦薄稻六百餘包、秦皇島•大連•營口•安東•等帮各行家仍抱絕對不做交易、故結果到貨雖不多、而市呈平定、厚薄粳行情悉無榮辱、杜洋尖及陰變元亦均平定、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來閘米船十號左右、晨刻開盤各貨走化店方稍取、價仍帶軟、後因客方心思轉堅、店銷絡續進取、致中次白粳價疲中轉挺、特白粳問津者寥寥、價形軟弱、薄稻來貨續有、零銷平常、價小近尺、羊杜尖價定局、白元價轉小三五分、</p>
<p>客米產價步昂</p>
<p>昨客秞到頭難旺、去化尤活、除本街繼續暢辦外、北洋寗波亦有小數點綴、而內地無錫與汕頭泉州進胃均貪、成交總數已達一萬五千包左右、高次各檔又見步砌一二分至三五分不一、以目下去化之活潑、產地之價昂、雖有到頭、市價終不易鬆落也、昨開出江西米七千八百二十四包、漢沙糙米二千包、湘米四千五百五十包、甬元一百包、</p>
<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>紗市急轉直下　進出籌碼調劑不勻　交易雖稀起伏甚鉅</p>
<p>連漲兩日之紗市、昨日驟然反動下落、此種情形、一因無巨戶進出、二則因取締投機頗爲嚴厲登記手續、不能草率從事、據市塲申請者有五六百戶、目下發給審查及格者僅四十餘家、塲中進出籌碼調劑不勻、故成交雖不旺盛面起伏力量則殊强大、又値海外美棉三品紗市一致下降、人心受其影響、市盤乃直綫下瀉矣、</p>
<p>標紗下瀉四五元</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月急轉直下、跌鳳銳利、因美棉意下游、大阪三品紗狂跌四元以外、因此人心驟遭挫拆、本月猛跌四元、其餘跌三元三四角、二盤以跌風劇烈、引起空方抵袖、本月回上二元、但遠期聞現紗交易不及上日之旺、而見平庸、迨至收盤、復入疲境、再跌一元外、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價狂跌三元四角至五元一角、查賣出大豐二百五十包、合興八百包、昶記六百包、長餘二百五十包、豐泰二百包、愼記五百五十包、願大四百包、潤康七百包、恊成六百包、買進慶大三百包、源大五百包、森康一千一百包、泰昌三百六十包、益昶二百包、永大四百五十包、晋康五百包、益記　百包、半日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>
<p>現銷較上日爲少</p>
<p>全日各帮買去統計千○十五包、售價跌•二元、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>期棉一蹶不振　美棉市况旣吿慘落　國內氣候亦覺順利</p>
<p>棉市復趨下落、目有跌無止境之慨、蓋以美棉慘跌局勢異常恐虛、預測前途、一角一分關口、恐難支持、於是人心衰頹、兼之國內氣候順利、月前年景頗佳、因是而處於一蹶不振之境矣、</p>
<p>各跌九角至一元餘</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、美棉大跌三十餘磅音、局勢甚弱、大孤三品花狂落一元八•九角至二元二角、於是市傷震撼、賣風復起、各月跌八•九角、二盤以後、聞紗市不穩、繼續下挫、標花結果各月比上日收盤價猛落九角至一元二•三•四角、查賣出大孚四千一百担、達記九百担、振大七百担、合興二千八百担、興昌八百担、仁豐一千五百担、潤康三千担、協成八百担、信誠三千三百担、新華七百担、買進同興八百担、源大二千三百担、愼昌三千二百担、愼記九百担、元一三千八百担、永大九百担、益康八百担、新昶一千三百担．長和三千三百担、半日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>
<p>廠需隨之同見岑寂</p>
<p>現棉消費又陷入停頓中、緣美棉暴跌、現貨敲破一角二分關口、測其趨勢、殊難穩定、三品期花慘跌二元二角、在此狂跌聲中廠商當然畏縮不前、廠需亦隨之而吿岑寂、碼頭來源姚花二百四十包、</p>
<p>天氣晴正多頭痛斬　美棉猛跌三十餘磅音</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、利物浦消息不佳、天氣及棉收情形順利、外商賣出、多頭忍痛斬結、各月跌七至十一磅音、在最近銳跌以後、賣方不無遲疑、惟買戶見輸出平庸、除一部份同業及日商限價買進外、成交殊少、亦有戒心、海斯德氏估計本週廠用爲一五七○○○包、利物浦存底爲三○一、○○○包收盤前因羅斯福聲言、有每磅八分之可能、大衆賣出、市價再疲、計現貨跌三十四磅音、期貨跌三十一至三十六磅音、英棉現貨跌八點、期貨跌六七點、印棉初因雨水過多而漲後因利物浦消息不佳及多頭了結而回、計平果爾漲○•七五羅比、奧姆辣跌一•二五羅比、白羅溪跌○•五至一•二五羅比、原電錄左、（二十三日電）</p>

<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>公債市况混沌　一方浮多出籠…一方套利加碼</p>
<p>昨華商證券交易所公債市况混沌、初以隔日暴漲過猛而轉下跌、繼以套利交易興趣、人心轉昂、環境本月份交易祇餘下週一•一天、多空雙方大抵因套利交易之扶助、得以軋平、因之亦不致有若何鉅大傾軋、昨日開盤浮多一方出籠、套利一方進行、交易尙旺、四號三十二•四十三及四十六號等均有套利交易、六號及五十四號買進、七號及四十三號賣出、次盤大都回小六•七•八角、而甲種獨好五五•六角、十號買進數量較鉅、趨勢盤旋向上、環境有無變化、殊難逆料、暫時當不致有鉅大波濤、市價結果小一角至一元五•六解不等、成交總數、共計二千七百五十五萬元、茲將其漲跌結果比較、列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<p>美股市漲後重盤旋</p>
<p>昨（二十三日）紐約股市、初因總続之改革法院計劃失敗而漲、繼因獲利多頭吐出、結果參差、成交九十一萬股、據經紀人意見、目前無大跌危險、</p>

<h3>抗熱運動</h3>
<p>— 墓傑</p>
<p>小朋友！你們要是對於己往的時事曾留心過的話，去年福建省主席陳儀，你們還記得他提倡過一種抗熱運動嗎？他命省府辦公人員，雖當炎暑，依舊照常工作，當時大家都以為抗熱運動足表現辦事的精神，予以讚許與響應。</p>
<p>我現在說的抗熱運動，是什麽樣的內容呢？</p>
<p>我現在說的抗熱運動，與陳主度提倡的路有不同，約略劃分起來，同時分二面講：</p>
<p>一方面是注意夏天的衛生，努力預防傳染疾病：因為夏天是病菌最繁盛的季節，一切致人性命的疾病非常流行，蒼蠅蚊蟲，隨時隨地在介紹疾病給人們，若飲食，起居，行動，稍一不愼，危險的疾病就立刻來臨，你們的年紀還不十分大，一定不知道如何注意衛生與預防疾病，那末你們時時得請問師長，依照師長敎你們的細心實行，而且自已對於一切都要講究衛生，有害肚子的食品少吃，有礙健康的臟衣時換，時時刻刻須注意自己的衣食住行。</p>
<p>一方面是不吋以爲了天氣炎熱而疏懈你們應做的工作：因爲夏天的天熱使人頭悶，安心坐定，也許要揮汗如雨，何况照常工作？當然分外難過，我知道你們常懷者這種心理：‘天氣怪熱，工作眞使人不舒服，不如乘乘風涼，玩耍一下吧！’糟啦！這種心理，一時果然感到舒服，但等到因為工作未畢而感着煩惱時，小朋友！我問你們還感着舒服嗎？所以，天氣任他怎樣熱，你們依舊作你們的工作，你們不能因為天氣炎熱而疏懈了你們應做的工作。</p>
<p>很長的暑期內，你們想做的事情必定很多，我告訴你！沒有一件事再比抗熱運動重要了。你們願意在安然中度過炎熱的暑期嗎？那末你們從今天起就實行抗熱運動。</p>
<p>來！小朋友努力推行抗熱運動！</p>
<h3>英兒的日記</h3>
<p>— 王怡</p>
<p>擬定暑期工作</p>
<p>床頭鬧鐘，‘零零……’的吵個不休，把我由睡夢中驚醒；揉一揉睡眼，把帳幃掛起，只見透進室中的兩三方太陽，斜斜地照射在地板上。再看一看時鐘，很明顯地告訴我——七點鐘了。</p>
<p>盥洗剛完畢，芹，城二君已先後來到我的家中；原來自學校放暑假後，昨天我們約好，今天在我家會齊，共同來討論怎樣擬定暑期中的工作？父親知道我們這回事，心中非常歡喜，還諄諄地對我們說道：‘工作無論怎樣計劃，應隨時隨地注意捨已爲人的精神，言行要一致，方不辜負你們暑假期中	的光陰呢’！</p>
<p>我們經過了一番縝密的討論，得到大家同意的一個結論：上午，是我們自修的時間；下午，是我們服務的時間。一般人在上午都有他們日常的工作，同時我們也不願意犧牲上午的寶貴光陰，所以我們把上午時間，定作自己閱讀書報，做暑假作業等工作時問；下午呢，因為大部分人在上午把工作做完畢後，多在豆棚瓜架下納凉避暑，我們願意利用這個時間，來做我們服務社會的工作，這个工作裹面，我們把他分作三方面來實施：一，勤學，二，講解時事新聞，三，練習歌唱愛國歌曲。</p>
<p>下午，我們一齊到區公所去‘會見區長先生，把這意思，轉告他，請他從旁恊助，他很同意，並且慰勉我們一番。回家後，我又寫了一封信給老師，請地對於我們的暑期社會服務工作，多多地批評輿指敎。</p>
<h3>介紹幾顆童星</h3>
<p>— 振聲</p>
<p>㊂牟菱</p>
<p>上海市政府成立十週紀念，市運動場上，展開了東方好萊塢之夜，許多燦爛的明星，一顆顆大放光明，照曜得大地上星光四射，牟菱這一個天眞的小童星，也出場參加公盛會，表演了一節蹕躂舞，遺留給許多觀眾，以一個深刻的印象！</p>
<p>牟菱這個名字，知道人恐怕還不及娟娟，和蓉蓉來得普遍，原因她還是電影界裹一位新的童星呀！她年紀也最小，今年祇有七歲，原籍四川重慶，和娟娟同行同鄉，爸爸牟鴻彝，畢業南滿醫科，媽媽陳保儉，是同德產科醫院的高材生，都是活人醫世的醫師，她倆膝下，祇有她，這是一顆掌上明珠旣沒有兄弟，也沒有姊妹，所以格外的喜歡她，愛護她。藝華公司的導演徐蘇靈，和她爸爸是好朋友，時常到她家裹去玩，看見有這樣一個天眞活潑的小姑娘，同時因為藝華當局，正要想物色造就一個小童星，所以便把這意思徵求了牟菱的父母同意，牟菱本人自己，聽了也非常高興，彼此商討了一些應辦的手續，雙方便在一張合同上，簽訂了五年的約期，履行到現在，也已經有七八個月了，她現在，在陳菱德路偉達小學一年級乙組裹讀書，每天早上，由她媽媽領了坐着自己的包車，先到顧家宅公園裹去逛一圈，做幾節柔軟體操，和健身運動，呼吸呼吸新鮮空氣，吃中飯再放包車接回來，放晚學的時候，再由她媽媽親自去接。她回來，經過顧家宅公園，再跑進去休息散步上那麽一個半個鐘頭同家，除了讀書以外，還跟娟娟一樣，都受業於蹕躂舞專家紀逢春君的門下，因爲她人很聰明，所以不消一個月，便已經略窺門經，一個月以後，眞個就登堂入奧了。暑假裹她的自修工作很勤，她告訴我：她最喜歡研究算術，“＋12＝15”，“45－20＝25”常常在她的小嘴裹默默自念：乘法和除法，她有時有些弄不清楚，她要是不到答數，那末情願　兩個鐘頭不歇手，孜孜不倦！說不定，未來她還是個數學家呢</p>

<p>滑翔機的構造和小型飛行機的式樣差不多，不過是沒有發動機的，所以必須有他種動力的援助以便升空；試飛的場所最好是在四周有低斜山岳的大平原或是海濱上，附近有樹林的地方最不適宜。</p>
<p>滑翔機又分滑空機和滑翔飛行機兩種，前者是供初步練習滑空之用，後者是在上昇風中作長時間飛行之用。飛行時或用人力，或用汽東動力（附圖五，六，七）曳之目平地或高原間飛起，至一定高度後，而將曳索脫去，使其自行飛翔在天空中，它的速率，每秒鐘可達一米半。（附圖八）</p>
<p>目下世界上最大的滑翔機要首推奧國‘可泊’博士投計的‘奧地利亞’一號，它的前翼長達三十米之鉅。（附圖九）</p>
<p>最近我國航空學校預備造一架滑翔機，擬在下屆全運會時作一表演，而歐亞航空公司亦擬製造數架，以資提倡。</p>
<p>滑翔機還可編成一列，由飛行機或飛船曳带在空中飛行，美，德各国會經试验，效果萬佳，前年蘇俄曾以飛機一架，後曳滑翔三架在三十九小時中飛三五五○公里的路遙，眞可以說它是一列‘空中列車’了！</p>
<h3>忠（六）</h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>他們如今决意要選舉一位總司令出來，以主持一切的軍事，賴士干侯爵先，就推舉做小販的加薩里諾，因為他是第一個舉兵起事的。這眞是一件怪的事情，那許多曾經受過軍事敎育的貴族，紳士和其他富有經騐的軍官們，都願意聽從這無知識的小販的指揮，一些兒沒有自私自利和嫉姤的思想。加薩里諾也一些兒沒有驕傲的熊度，仍像平日間那麽的謙遜，然而從他的每一件事情和每一句說話上看來，都足以表現地的總明和能幹，的確足以當得上農民們所稱呼他的‘盎育的聖人’的頭銜。這時他們的希望達到了最高峯；他們的人數已比從前增多了不少，所有的軍器好得多了。他們並且已討論到怎樣向巴黎進發，迎接小主回來，就在拉方台的首鎮旭來地方加冕，另行組織他們的政府。</p>
<p>加薩里諾統帶着他的部隊，轉向南資地方開去，留下了亨利，和一隊農民，保衛着薩茂爾；但是他竟沒有方法阻止他們回到木鄉去，因為他們念家心切，而目前恰又無事可做，一方面又不知道防守的重要，竟一個個溜到他們的家裹去了。到了後來，只剩下了亨利和幾個軍官，每到晚上，他們往往走到應當駐守的所在去，高喊着：‘國王萬歲！’表示他們是有着防備的。無奈人數越减越少，到末後只剩八個人了，亨利沒法維持下去，只得離開了薩茂爾去和盎亦爾地方的同志聯絡起來，那時地們可巧救下了一班敎士，本來被敵人監禁着预備處死的。那些敎士們又快樂，又感激，向那搭救他們的農民道謝，農民忙道：‘不要感謝我們，我們本來是為了你們而作戰的。要是我們不能搭救你們，也就不敢回到我們的家裹去。現在你們是自由了，足見上帝仍然帮助着我們的。’</p>
<p>然而大局又轉变了，巴黎政府派了一隊强有力的兵士到卜加希區域，很殘酷的燒殺了一場，克列生被燒成了一片平平地，連那火藥廠也燒燬了。賴士干侯爵本已料到故鄉不免遭刦，但他為了要安定人必起見，並沒有移動他爵邸中的東西。他的家庭早已和軍隊合在一起，凡是懦弱無告的入，惟有跟着軍隊方可安全了。加薩里諾進攻南資，不幸也遭了失敗，他自己又受了重傷，幾天以後，就死了，但他爲了盡忠國家而死，他是非常願意的。</p>
<h3>阻力</h3>
<p>— 真</p>
<p>在星期日的那一天，敏兒和和他的哥哥聰兒在家裹的那塊小草場上玩皮球，正在玩得高興的時候，敏兒不留神的用力一脚，把那球踢得飛一般的遠過去，但一会兒它便漸漸的停了。他不知不覺的想出這個問題，它怎樣的會停住的？於是他便開口問他的哥哥。</p>
<p>他哥哥說：‘皮球在地滾，不久便停了，於是我們就料想得出那地面和球面之間，一定有一種力量能使這皮球漸漸地停住，這種力我們雖然不能看見，但一定是存在的，不然怎麽皮球好好的會停止？這種力我們便叫它阻力，阻力是一種活動力的的反對，它常常能使動力的工作效力减少，譬如我們多走了路，脚便覺得酸，一方面也是阻力的關係，不是工作的效力减少嗎？所以這阻力被我們認為最討厭的一種東西，因此常常想法去驅除它，像在機器的輪軸間不是要時當的加油嗎？都無非是要减少它的影響’</p>
<p>‘那麽我們不要這阻力，能使機器多　造些東西，不是更好麽？’</p>
<p>不，它也有它的用處，我們利用這阻力的地方也很多着：如果世界上一旦沒有了阻力，那也不行，以致什麽東西也不能在路上行走了。我們所以能走路，都幸虧有了阻力，不然我們只能用脚抵住了地面，而移動脚，爲什麽冰面上很滑？這因爲冰面上的阻力都小，因此我們不能在冰上去。同樣如果沒有阻力，一座梯子便不能斜靠在墻壁上面供我們上樓下樓了。我再舉一個例子：如果有一輛人力車被人拉動而發生動力，這動力是向前的，但車輪和地面間便發生了阻力，自為阻力是向後的，於是這兩個力是在相反的方向，所以便成了一個相對的力而使車輪向前轉動，假使沒有了阻力，那麽那車輪就祇令在原體轉動，不會向前了。所以阻力是我們必不可少的東西，我們是很需要它，但是同時我們卻又厭惡它。一種東西是罷不了有利有害的，那麽我們只看它對待我們是帮助還是有害而定了，如果有害的，我們應常極力是使它减少才是。’</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>讀張自忠談話</h3>
<p>— 史揖</p>
<p>説過“姓張的决不做對不起民的事”，而在所謂“和平談判”中奔走最力的張自忠，最近發表談話，中有曰：“當知中國是整個的國家，中華民族是整個的民族，如屬國家整個問題，應由中央統籌處理，若僅係地方事件，當唯冀察政委會委員長之命令是從。……”</p>
<p>然則蘆溝橋事件是“整個事件”還是“地方事件”呢？</p>
<p>“中國是整個的國家，中華民族是整個的民族”，牽一髮而動全身，冀察既是中國的土地，在冀察境內所發生的事件，自然也就是整個國家事件。</p>
<p>關於蘆溝事件之爲敵人有計劃的陰謀，蔣委員長在廬山談話會上也早已説過了。蔣委員長又説：“我們的東四省失陷，已有了六年之久，繼之以塘沽恊定，現在衝突地點已到了北平門口的蘆溝橋，如果蘆溝橋可以受人壓廹强佔，那末我們五百年古都北方政治文化的中心與軍事重鎭的北平，就要變成瀋陽第二，今日的北平，若果變成昔日的瀋陽，今日的冀察，亦將成爲昔日的東四省，北平若可變成瀋陽，南京又何嘗不可變成北平？”觀之，我們可知無論從那點來看，蘆溝橋事件决不是“地方事件”，</p>
<p>而奇怪的却是並未並經過中央允准，抗敵的三十七師被擊退到“北平一帶”以外的防地去了。</p>
<p>就退十萬歩來説，蘆溝橋事件可以由冀察政委會來解决，然則冀察政委會是否是屬於中央的一個行政機關呢？屬於中央的行政機關而不服膺中央所昭示的四點最低限度，這是不是就是“服從命令”？</p>
<p>若説不是，則“中國是整個的國家，中華民族是整個的民族，”又作何解釋！</p>
<p>二十九軍駐滬辦事處李處長在山東同鄉會招待席上説：“尤希輿論界多做鼓勵文章，少作刺激論調，免墮敵人奸計云。”我覺得，這話在原則上是對的，也不限於對二十九軍爲然，但若不幸某些人已“墮敵人奸計”，則即想做“鼓勵文章，”也有無從做起之苦也。</p>
<h3>“文明”的心理</h3>
<p>— 尹荑</p>
<p>小時候讀小説，時常讀到“以小人之心，度君子之腹”這一類故事和詞句，抬起頭來看看人與人之間的關係，確也有此種現象存在着；但是那時候終以爲這是中國的特産，至少也是祇有“野蠻”民族才會有此種心理産生。</p>
<p>但是後來天天讀國際新聞，突然發現此種心理並非祗是“野蠻”民族的獨有的“優點”，而是越“文明”的國家，此種心理也就表現得更明顯；就是“王道”的國家中，除了更强烈更明顯的表現出這種心理之外，也並没有什麽更高明的想法。至此，我才百分之百的明瞭，“以小人之心，度君子之腹”的一類心理，倒是頗“文明”的，一點也不野蠻不矛盾。</p>
<p>這幾天來，中日關係愈趨愈緊張了</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，接着，就在報紙上讀到了一段消息：</p>
<p>“本報南京二十二日電”據關係方面消息：自蘆溝橋事件發生後，我大使館職員及僑民，均被嚴密監視。使館附近有暗探及警察多人駐守，館員外出，暗探即緊隨於後，抹殺外交官之尊嚴與特權，實開世界各國未有之惡例。中央社駐東京特派員陳博生，亦於事件發生後，受日警視廳嚴密監視，除一行一動均有偵探跟隨外，並給予汽車一輛，無論到任何地點，必須乘坐該車，由車夫每日報告陳之行動於官廳……</p>
<p>日本原可以稱之謂“問牒國家”，它不但在國內各處密佈偵探，而且在國外活動的也很可觀：在“×××”，“××××”的招貼紙掩護之下來中國活動的更是多得不容易統計。</p>
<p>毫不費力的奪沒東四省：扶起了木頭人溥儀：建立了殷逆汝耕的偽自治：離間了內蒙古……等等，就是這些大人物的得意傑作。川島芳子，土肥原，松室少將都是他們侵略史上的明星”。</p>
<p>自己慣做這種事情，就不得不疑心人家在自己國土上也在活動。此乃“人之常情”也。也就是所謂“以小人之心，度君子之腹”心理的具體表現。</p>
<p>中國舊小說中，往往有“馬快賊出身”的故事。本來“馬快”是專捉盜賊的，最熟悉盜賊的行徑的，祇有盜賊自己。所以用盜賊來做“馬快”，眞是再妥當不過的。但是毛病也未始沒有，而且很大。因為他們自己是做過這種事情的，對於此一類事當然特別的小心，因此就是一件極平淡極平淡的小事，也時常會引起他們的疑慮，甚至會“無風起浪”，到結果是引得人家笑歪了嘴，而自己也弄得哭不得笑不得。</p>
<h3>可憐虫</h3>
<p>— 關尹喜</p>
<p>在那精緻的，有點近於東洋作　的酒排間，我時當碰見他，一個瘦弱的，老實的漁民。一身襤褸的衣服，一副愁苦的，不修過幅的嘴面。像他這樣的裝束，這樣的嘴面，不像是常來坐酒排間的人，但是事實我却常碰到他，一跨進門來，便後一切都不存在，垂頭喪氣的直朝塞在那最幽暗一角，不受注意的檯位上發愁的坐着，眼睛乏神的，痴呆的盯視着地下。</p>
<p>他從不參加任何人的談話，喝點酒，或吃點什麽點心。當酒排間開放了，第一個進來的客人是他，要關門了，最後退出去的客人也是他。在這漁村，他是被當作半個人看的，因為在人們看來他全身都麻木了，死了，只有一個糢糊的意識。</p>
<p>關於他底事，被人們用一種趣聞的形式流傳着，朋友告訴我：</p>
<p>“別看他是個傻子，從前他也曾過過好日子。但是，女人把他毀了。三年前他跌倒得太利害了，直到現在還爬不起來。”</p>
<p>這些話使我感到很濃的興趣，我决定去問他作一次拜訪。因此，在一個沉靜的，仲夏的夜晚，我沿着海灘，走向他住着的漁民小屋。屋子是用蠔皮混和着泥土築成的，狹小，潮濕，而且什亂，月光從窗子射了進來，照在一些污爛的傢具上，現出無限的憂鬱與凄淸。我在那兒站着，摸索了約有一分鐘，但什麽都沒有看見。</p>
<p>“他還沒回來”。我這樣想着，動足沿着原路回家。</p>
<p>沙灘上，裸赤着，月光在空中炫耀地熌灼着，從沙粒中射出了幽幽的光芒；四週靜寂，潮退了，海在休息着。我非常渴想到沙灘上去走走，這樣過着，不上五分鐘就有一個黑點子把我吸住了。我沿着一行足印走過去，向他看看，正是那個“只算半個人”的人，他漠然地，憂鬱地在那兒坐着，對着海痴痴的望，像死人似的，當我走近時，連動也不動一動的。</p>
<p>“我是特別來看你的，朋友！”我說開始計劃定的辭令。</p>
<p>他仍舊那樣子連動也不動，好像沒有聽見。</p>
<p>“因為人們在傳說着，關於你底生活狀態，使我感到深切興趣”</p>
<p>他略略的聳一聳肩抬起眼來，向我悵惘的看着，他底瘦削的面孔充滿了悲恻與膽怯的表情，好像是說：“是這樣嗎？”</p>
<p>“所以我想來和你談談。”最後我這樣結束着。”</p>
<p>他底眼睛從我身上離開，低着，垂倒在胸前。</p>
<p>“你肯告訴我嗎？我想聽你過去的事。”在他身旁我坐下了。</p>
<p>“過去的車？”他低低的，第一次開口對自己重複着，聲音很是黯啞而乏力。“你是那個城裹來的先生？”他突然興奮起來，喝斯底里地向我狠狠的眐着。是嗎？在酒館裹我看到你的。”</p>
<p>我答應着，正是他所猜想的。</p>
<p>“那麽你看见了很多人了？”他注意地問。</p>
<p>“當然！城裹是什麽等樣的人都有的。……”我笑着回答。</p>
<p>“你看過一個女人嗎？一個低低的但很結實的女人。”</p>
<p>“在那兒這種女人多得很，要看好多就有好多的。”</p>
<p>“當眞是這樣？我底老婆就是這樣的人！”他嘆息着更改着另一種聲調悲哀的說道：“三年前當我去出海時，她給漁業組合裹的一個日本仔用船拐走了，直到現在我還沒有把她找着。但是，她是一個好女人，不會離開我，她要回來的。因此，我常到酒館裹去等，去年我在那兒碰見了一個人，他告訴我，他在台灣的妓寮裏看到她，她告訴他，她就要回來了，呌我在酒館裹等。”</p>
<p>“你相信這話是眞的嗎？”</p>
<p>“為什麽不是眞的呢？她不會騙我的。”他說着，堅定地露出了徽笑。</p>
<p>當我走時，他還在我背後送了一會，低聲的囑着：</p>
<p>“要是你先生回城去，碰見了她，就替我帶個信給她。……”</p>
<p>我答着，揚揚手便走開。一直到家，還不住的爲着這可憐虫可悲的命運惶惑着。</p>

<h3>Central Authorities Discuss Major Plans to Deal with the Crisis</h3>
<p>Song Zheyuan Also Convened His Subordinates in Beiping - Japanese Troops are Digging Trenches and Hastening the Construction of Fortifications - Matsui Counter-Questions the Reason for Our Troops' Non-Withdrawal</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The situation in North China, the Japanese army still has no peaceful intentions, but instead is increasing troops in Tianjin and Beiping. How the future will unfold is difficult to predict. In order to deal with the crisis, the central authorities gathered important personnel on the morning of the 24th to discuss everything. In general, there is great indignation towards the enemy's invasion of our territory and sovereignty. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, sent a telegram to Nanjing on the evening of the 23rd, presenting it to the highest authorities. He gave a detailed account of the current situation in North China and the process of troop withdrawal agreed upon by both sides. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

Zhu Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Feng Zhi'an, Liu Ruming, Zhao Dengyu and others met in Beiping at 10:00 am on the 24th and decided to first achieve the goal of Japanese troop withdrawal. However, it is heard that the Japanese side intends to discuss all issues in North China on the spot before discussing troop withdrawal, so the development of the situation is quite noteworthy. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] In recent days, the situation in North China has appeared to ease slightly on the surface. Our troops have been successively and automatically redeployed, but the Japanese troops, in addition to slightly withdrawing troops along the railway line, the Japanese troops in the Dajing Village and Wulidian areas, as of this afternoon, showed no signs of immediate withdrawal. Moreover, Japanese military supplies are being continuously transported in, indicating that there are many hidden reefs in the path to peace. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

Puppet troops will also be stationed in the border areas of Chahar and Jehol and various places in Bulutuzhesi to prepare for an invasion of Suiyuan. To guard against any contingency, in addition to ordering the troops at the front to strengthen their defenses, Wang Jingguo, Li Fuying, Zhao Chengshou, Peng Yubin and Sun Lanfeng, who recently returned to Bing from Lu, and Ma Yanshou were summoned to receive instructions.

<p>[Zhangjiakou] Except for a small number of Japanese personnel in the Zhangbei and Huade special affairs agencies in northern Chahar, all Japanese and Korean residents have been withdrawn as of the 24th. The Zhang and Hua special affairs agency chiefs, Ying Xiangyue, were summoned by telegram by Xiangyue on the afternoon of the 23rd and flew to Tianjin from Zhangbei to report on the recent situation in northern Chahar and to request instructions on future plans to instigate bandits and puppets. The bandit and puppet side is actively rushing to build defensive projects within the territory of Zhangbei, and a large number of laborers are working overnight, in a state of great urgency. Due to financial constraints, they are even more aggressively levying taxes, adding a new type of harsh tax, that is, each household, regardless of the number of people, is only allowed to use one pot. If one pot is added, an additional tax of eight cents per month will be levied. The heavy taxes and numerous levies have made the people unbearable. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Side Attaches Importance to the Attitude of Our Central Authorities</h3>
<p>Various Newspapers Observe That There Will Be No New Troubles - Asahi Shimbun Advocates Adjusting National Relations - Nichinichi Shimbun Still Holds a Tough Stance</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Today, the focus here, although still watching whether the 37th Division will completely withdraw on the scheduled date, is paying more attention to Nanjing's attitude. The special telegrams from various newspapers have different observations. Generally speaking, most of them say that there will be no new troubles. The people of Tokyo are becoming more calm. Stocks are still rising, either rising ten or eight yuan, or rising twenty-three or four yuan compared to the lowest price after the incident. The parliament will hold its opening ceremony on the 25th, elect various committees on the 26th, and the ministers of state will give policy speeches on the 27th. The speeches of Prime Minister Konoe, Foreign Minister Hirota, and Army Minister Sugiyama on the China issue are most noteworthy. According to reports, Army Minister Sugiyama and Foreign Minister Hirota had important consultations on the night of the 23rd, and are probably secretly discussing fundamental adjustment methods. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Today's Asahi Shimbun editorial is gradually becoming more moderate. After discussing the course of the incident's resolution, it said that the certain doubts of the Chinese side caused by the temporary dispatch of troops will soon disappear and are not a cause for concern. Nanjing's concerns about the loss of national rights and the possibility of being severely restricted in the future for the local resolution have led to the policy of non-recognition, but there is no real cause for concern and can be transformed. From a general point of view, the political and military opposition between China and Japan still exists. If a comprehensive solution is not quickly sought, a long-term opposition is still inevitable. Recently, commentators have said that it is appropriate to strive for fundamental adjustments, and we cannot help but agree. We sincerely hope that the people of both countries will return to calm, first disarm their minds, be open-minded, and cooperate to improve national relations. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Nichinichi Shimbun's editorial holds the opposite view from the Asahi Shimbun. It first describes the still uneasy situation in North China, and then discusses the tough attitude of the National Government, saying that if the ministry continues to be well-off, the stability of North China that Japan has been looking forward to will not be guaranteed. The transfer is even more likely to lead to a dangerous situation. Since the incident, we have argued that there is no other way but to resolve it with force, and we now feel the need to be more decisive. To establish a peaceful foundation, we must build from the foundation. Sacrificing for lasting peace is truly unavoidable. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Peking University Professors Issue Declaration</h3>
<p>Recounting the Atrocities of Japanese Ambitious Militarists; Japan Should Bear Responsibility for Disrupting Peace</p>
<p>[Beiping] All professors of Peking University, today issued a declaration regarding the Lugou Bridge Incident, the text being over a thousand words long, recounting the truth of the Lugou Bridge Incident, declaring to the world the responsibility for disrupting peace. (24th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] All professors of Peking University have issued a declaration regarding the Lugou Bridge Incident, which states: "The Chinese nation has always been peace-loving. As early as the Zhou and Qin Dynasties, our ancient sages advocated the great principles of 'stopping war' and 'non-aggression'. For thousands of years, we have always held a principle of settling matters peacefully with our neighbors, treating them with propriety and righteousness, and expecting sincerity and trustworthiness from them. If not for those with the ambition of wolves and the cunning of foxes who plot mischief, we would never bear to meet them with arms. This is commonly known to those who have read Chinese history. Since September 18, 1931, Japan has illegally occupied our four northeastern provinces, forming a puppet organization, forcibly occupying Shanhaiguan, invading the Great Wall, coercing Tianjin and Peiping with violence, interfering with our country's internal affairs, protecting smuggling with armed forces, corrupting China's customs duties, and even more so, condoning vagrants, poisoning North China, sheltering traitors, disturbing local areas, arbitrarily stationing troops within the passes, and forcibly conducting street fighting exercises in the city. Such actions are not what modern countries that respect justice would do. Our government, after the revolution, is working hard to shift power from a minority of violent aggressors to the majority of the people. If Japan's national policy is not determined by adventurous ambitious figures who are gambling everything, but by wise and experienced elders, then friendly relations between China and Japan are not impossible, and peace in East Asia should be increasingly consolidated. Unexpectedly, this hope of ours has become a castle in the air. The Japanese ambitious warlords have become increasingly irrational and arrogant. In mid-October of last year, they unreasonably forced us to withdraw our garrison from Fengtai. On July 7th of this year, they again conducted live-fire exercises near the Lugou Bridge in the middle of the night, attempting to imitate the old trick of attacking our Shenyang, invading our Wanping County seat, in order to control our ancient capital, the cultural center of seven hundred years. After our defending soldiers stopped them, they took the opportunity to provoke, opening fire and bombarding. For two weeks, the Japanese side has not only been untrustworthy, repeatedly violating the agreement of both sides to withdraw troops simultaneously, but also occupying our Beining Railway, transporting heavy troops, invading our farmland, and harming our crops. Within our territory, they have arbitrarily established Japanese military airfields, and in Tianjin, our important northern town, they occupied the station, inspected mail and telegrams, and arrested reporters. To the west, along the Pinghan Railway line, they used machine guns to strafe trains, killing passengers, and forcibly conscripted laborers and requisitioned military supplies everywhere. Relying on force, they bullied the good and honest people. These atrocities are commonly seen and heard by Chinese and foreign people. These atrocities are not only intolerable from the standpoint of our nation, but also intolerable from the standpoint of humanity and justice. Although our nation loves peace, we cannot abandon our duty to defend our country, nor can we sit idly by and watch humanity and justice be destroyed without rising up to protect them. Now, the hope for peace has reached a critical juncture. Our government still adheres to the policy of 'seeking self-preservation and co-existence,' and has always been intent on safeguarding peace. The speech delivered by Chairman Chiang a few days ago has already gained the sympathy of rational people around the world. Whether China and Japan will forge eternal hatred, and whether Japan is willing to be the leader in destroying peace in East Asia, all depends on the attitude of the Japanese government and the actions of the Japanese army. If Japan still does not repent, then we, the whole nation, will have to sacrifice everything and resist to the end. Unfortunately, when that time comes, we will fight to resist violence, to protect our territory, for humanity and justice, for the freedom of mankind, and for the peace of the world. If the majority of mankind has sympathy for maintaining humanity and justice, and has the determination to protect freedom and peace, we are confident that we will eventually achieve final victory. We are engaged in education, and have the responsibility to maintain culture. We are engaged in promoting peace and justice every day. We cannot bear to see our neighbor, of the same script and race, taking the risk of defying the world, to be the first to destroy human culture and disrupt peace in East Asia. We sincerely hope that comrades in the world of culture will jointly help us awaken these Japanese politicians and soldiers in their dreams. If they do not immediately come to their senses and force our peace-loving nation to rise up in resistance, then not only will China and Japan suffer a great calamity together, but the waves of horror throughout the world will also be stirred up from this point on. We are willing to sacrifice ourselves for humanity, for justice, for freedom, and for peace. We only hope that the wise people of the world will recognize that the culprit who destroys peace and destroys culture is Japan, not China. (24th, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>The Great Path for China to Save Itself and Survive</h3>
<p>— Feng Youlan</p>
<p>According to reports, the first general meeting of members of the China Cultural Construction Association closed on the 11th. On the 12th, a declaration was issued, one of the main points of which was: "Agriculture is the foundation of our country. Therefore, agriculture is still the first step for our country to increase production. We should move from a purely agricultural country to a country where agriculture, industry, and commerce develop together." The original text of the declaration has not yet been seen in the north. Let us discuss the few simple sentences quoted here for the time being.</p>
<p>Speaking of the distinction between agriculture and industry, it should only be discussed in terms of the objects of production, not in terms of the methods or tools of production. In terms of the objects of production, agriculture can only be agriculture. In terms of production methods or tools, agriculture can also be industry, because we can use machines to cultivate and produce on a large scale. Anyone who uses machines for large-scale production, we call him industry. Using machines for cultivation to produce on a large scale is called the industrialization of agriculture. Like the United States and the Soviet Union, either they have become industrialized countries, or they are about to become industrialized countries. We say that they are industrialized countries only in terms of their production methods. If we talk about the objects of production, the agricultural products they produce are also not in the minority. In terms of the objects of production, as long as the natural environment permits, no country is unwilling to be a 'country where agriculture, industry, and commerce develop together'. Those who only act as industrialized countries are actually limited by their natural environment. A country without vast fertile land cannot have agriculture. But if we talk about production methods, then there is no such thing as a 'country where agriculture, industry, and commerce develop together', because agriculture has also been industrialized. In terms of production methods, there is no distinction between agriculture and industry. As for commerce, it is not a production system and cannot be compared with agriculture and industry.</p>
<p>The China Cultural Construction Association's so-called 'country where agriculture, industry, and commerce develop together' must be in terms of the objects of production, which is not objectionable in itself. However, generally speaking, people often fail to clarify the distinction between agriculture and industry, thinking that agriculture and industry are always opposed in any respect, which often causes many misunderstandings. Some people are also confused by the saying 'Our country is founded on agriculture', thinking that we seem to be able to do without industry, or without a lot of industry. In order to dispel these mistakes, I would like to further explain this point here.</p>
<p>We often hear people proposing an economic cooperation plan for us. According to this plan, China is an agricultural country and only develops in agriculture. They are industrialized countries and only develop in industry. China exchanges its agricultural products for their industrial products; they exchange their industrial products for China's agricultural products. In this way, the two sides can cooperate economically without conflict. If there is no economic conflict, then other conflicts will naturally disappear. According to the views of those who advocate 'Our country is founded on agriculture', this method also seems to be 'well-founded and reasonable.' But if we really do this, imagine what China will become. China will truly become a supplier of raw materials and a consumer of production for others. A country that is a supplier of raw materials and a consumer of production for a country is exactly a country's, without any discount, complete and authentic colony. The ultimate goal of the political and military suppression of weak nations by modern powers is nothing more than to want the weak nations to permanently be their suppliers of raw materials and consumers of production. We have recently seen that some European countries are demanding a redistribution of colonies or a redistribution of raw materials, the two being different names but the same reality.</p>
<p>If we want not to be a colony, we must catch up quickly and hurry to industrialize. What we are afraid of is that others will not allow us to industrialize. We ourselves must not be influenced by what 'Our country is founded on agriculture' and have some unnecessary doubts and fears about industrialization. In fact, as long as we are industrialized, our agriculture will naturally increase production. There are only purely agricultural countries that often suffer from famine due to natural disasters such as floods and droughts. I have never heard of people in an industrialized country being more foodless than people in a purely agricultural country.</p>
<p>To go a step further, even if industrialization really has many problems, we must have it. Because in the present world, non-industrialized countries have no way to go except to be colonies.</p>
<p>Let's take war as an example. We often hear about war now, but it seems that very few people notice that in the present world, a non-industrialized country is not qualified to talk about formal large-scale warfare. War must use tools, just as economic production must use tools. The war tools of the past were handicraft-style; the war tools of the present are industrial-style. That is to say, war tools are now mechanized, and fighting now is not about using people, but about using machines. Cannons and machine guns are machines; airplanes and tanks are also machines. I think the book Investiture of the Gods is the most superstitious and the most scientific. It is the most scientific because in it, fighting does not rely on people, but on 'magic weapons'. It is the most superstitious because in it, magic weapons come from magic rather than from the application of natural laws. However, in any case, the current war is really like the war in the Investiture of the Gods. If one side offers an airplane, the other side must also offer an airplane, or at least offer many anti-aircraft shells. If one side offers a magic weapon, and the other side has no magic weapon to break it, then no matter how many troops you have, you can only admit defeat. May I ask where these magic weapons come from? Where does a non-industrialized country get these magic weapons?</p>
<p>China's national strength has been growing in recent years, and this is because China is now on the road to industrialization. We have seen the Soviet Union become a world power because of rapid industrialization. We have also seen that Japan has recently announced a new grand plan for further industrialization. It is probably afraid that the Soviet Union and China will catch up, so it will start from the bottom up. This is indeed fundamental. We must industrialize in order to solve China's problems. Our current industrialization is a great path, a unique path, to build a modern country and save it from destruction.</p>
<p>This path, because it is unique, is the path that China, from the late Qing Dynasty to the present, has generally followed intentionally or unintentionally. Although sometimes it detours, it soon turns back, because other roads are broken rivers and dead ends. When it hits a wall, it will naturally come back. However, because it sometimes detours, China's industrialization has lagged behind our neighbors. For example, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway was planned in the late Qing Dynasty and was only completed now. This industrial backwardness is the root cause of China's being bullied.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that action is easy but knowledge is difficult, and this can be proven in this regard. China's industrialization can be said to have started in the late Qing Dynasty with Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang, Li Hongzhang, Zhang Zhidong and others, but we now have a clear understanding of the meaning of industrialization. Since we know its meaning, we must accelerate its progress, catch up, and never hesitate again, lest we make one mistake after another.</p>
<p>In the Weekly Forum of this newspaper on April 18, Mr. Xu Xusheng had the following criticism of me. He said: 'They advocate that the only problem in China now is the problem of industrialization, which is putting the cart before the horse. Not having a strong interest in the natural world, only paying attention to industrial improvement, will inevitably lead to water without a source, and 'its drying up can be waited for.' Mr. Xu seems not to understand our meaning. We did not say 'The only problem in China now is the problem of industrialization.' We only said that China's only way out is industrialization. To think of this way out, there must naturally be many conditions, and scientization is one of them. Industrialization can include scientization, but scientization cannot include industrialization. Therefore, we only say industrialization.</p>
<h3>The German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact Has No Relationship with the Sino-Japanese Dispute</h3>
<p>Berlin Authorities Reiterate Statement; Anglo-Japanese Economic Negotiations Have Been Suspended</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding Germany's attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute, a statement was issued here today, first stating that Germany is very concerned about the disturbance of political relations between the two major countries in the Far East. Because Germany has no political goals in the Far East, the Sino-Japanese dispute will affect Germany's economic interests. Therefore, Germany hopes to obtain a solution in the Far East as in Europe, guaranteeing economic construction and international trade in goods. The statement also mentioned the declaration issued by the German ambassador to the United States in Washington, and the welcome of world opinion to that declaration. The statement also sternly condemned the report of French radio stations, that Germany and Italy hope that the Sino-Japanese dispute will expand due to the Spanish civil war. Taking the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact as the basis for such slander is a characteristic of propagating Germany's purpose and interests to the world in an irresponsible manner. The German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact has absolutely no relationship with the Sino-Japanese dispute. (23rd, National Maritime Telegraph)</p>

<p>Brussels: Prime Minister Tsiran, having previously been entrusted by the governments of Britain and France to study the economic conditions of various countries in the world to determine whether it is possible to eliminate various obstacles to international trade, King Leopold III specially sent a long letter to Prime Minister Tsiran for this matter. He proposed the establishment of a permanent International Economic Research Bureau, where many of the most famous economic authorities from various countries would cooperate in their personal capacity, rather than as representatives of their respective governments. The letter also stated: "If we truly want to reduce war and restore peaceful sentiments among people of all countries, then we must have the courage to consider economic issues in their entirety. All major economic problems that threaten the overall stability of the world, such as the allocation of raw materials, exchange rate issues, the distribution of the world's labor force, and maintaining a balance between agricultural and industrial countries, should all be resolved. I deeply feel that the timing for this attempt is quite favorable at the moment, and I believe that this attempt will not only receive the support of governments of various countries, but also of major social, religious, and charitable organizations, and will also bring the world closer together. And we can use this to show all of humanity, especially to people in the East, that we value spiritual power above materialistic attempts." (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 23rd)</p>

The King of Belgium also stated that humans in the world are currently infringing on each other, but if we can find a way to reconcile them, we will contribute to humanity with humaneness. We can also show the people in the East on the facts, not in empty words, that we Westerners value the spiritual strength that comes from friendly and sincere feelings far above direct material interests." The characteristics of the economic research institution to be established in the future are universality, permanence, and independence. Its purpose is to study the various elements of the universal economic institution and adapt them to the ever-changing environment. Furthermore, in order to enable this institution to fulfill its mission, it must strive to be independent from national forces, and create harmony in the world by cooperating with those who are well versed in agriculture, industry, commerce, finance, and labor.

However, since France and the Soviet Union established a mutual assistance agreement, and Japan and Germany established an anti-communist agreement, the good relations between the two sides have become dimmed as a result. It is a real situation, and my primary task is to eliminate all misunderstandings. As for the economy, I will strive to adjust the existing relationship so that both sides benefit."

<h3>Roosevelt Remains Optimistic After Failure of Judicial Reform Plan</h3>
<p>Supreme Court's Interpretation of the Constitution Has Adopted a Broader View</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt declared today that although his Supreme Court reform plan has failed, this action has already had an intangible effect on judicial reform. Since the judicial reform plan was proposed in February, the cases adjudicated by the Supreme Court have no longer displayed their previous rigidity. He also said, "Although we have made some progress, we still need to work hard in the future." (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the judicial reform bill previously proposed by President Roosevelt, which has been rejected by the Senate and replaced with a new bill, the President expressed optimism to the press, saying that the Supreme Court's recent judgments and interpretations of the Constitution have adopted a broader perspective. He added that the Supreme Court is more adaptable to the various needs of modern government, which is gratifying. He also stated that he has considered various necessary measures so that the country can have a perfect organization to cope with future economic panic. He further stated that the government is not yet prepared to appoint judges to replace the retiring Supreme Court judges. In addition, political figures predict that some Supreme Court judges may resign on their own in the near future. Several of the oldest judges on the Supreme Court originally intended to retire, but after President Wei proposed the judicial reform bill, the judges did not want to give the impression that they were yielding to the government due to the President's threat, so they have not yet resigned. Now that the President's judicial reform plan has failed, some judges may resign and retire in the near future. If so, the President will no longer need to pass laws to reorganize the Supreme Court. Some political figures believe that the President still holds an optimistic attitude towards judicial reform, and the reason should be sought in this. (Havas Telegraph, Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Marconi's Estate Totals Five Million Pounds</h3>
<p>[Rome] After the death of wireless radio inventor Marconi, his assets in Italy and abroad totaled five million pounds. There are no special bequests in his will, so most of his estate should be inherited by his eldest daughter, Elettra, as the legal heir. His other three children will be entitled to a portion of the reserved inheritance according to law. As for Marconi's wife, she enjoys the right to use and benefit from one-quarter of the total estate. (Havas Telegraph, Central News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>French Correspondence</p>
<h3>A Look at the Future World Economic Conference (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ke</p>
<p>At a time when countries around the world are massively increasing their military budgets and actively expanding their armed forces, suddenly the international community hears about reducing armaments and convening economic conferences, etc. The Disarmament Conference Committee of the League of Nations in Geneva did hold a meeting quietly at the end of last month, which in fact yielded no results, something that was expected. However, on the other hand, the attention of European politicians is mostly focused on U.S. President Roosevelt, hoping that he will take the lead in convening a world economic conference, hoping to seek economic compromise among countries and ease the competition in armaments. Looking at the intention of the U.S. President's delegation of Davis, the former U.S. representative to the Disarmament Conference, to attend the International Sugar Conference and the coronation of the King of England, it may be a sign of convening a world economic conference.</p>
<p>In fact, we know that since Hitler began his insane expansion of armaments, he publicly declared to the German people that cannons can replace butter and coal can turn into bread. This slogan temporarily intoxicated the people, making them endure the government's massive extraction of sweat and blood to support military expenditures. But on the other hand, Hitler's military policy has forced his neighbors to be drawn into this arms expansion vortex. France's budget this year has to issue national defense bonds of 10,500,000,000 francs to fill the budget deficit for special national defense expenditures. This is a reaction to Hitler's arms expansion policy. Britain has been even more affected by Italy's occupation of Abyssinia, which has changed Britain's advantage in the Mediterranean. The route to India has also felt the threat from Italy, so it has no choice but to resolutely follow France with a huge amount of 1,400,000,000 pounds (16 billion francs), to reorganize its military over five years (of which 40,000 pounds are borrowed from the public through the issuance of bonds). Britain's traditionally balanced budget has also become a deficit due to special budget expenditures. When it comes to Germany's military spending, it has always been considered a state secret and is not made public. However, we can prove the extent of its military expansion simply from the amount of its borrowing. Last year, it borrowed a total of 5,000,000,000 marks (about 4 billion francs), of which 2.3 billion marks were public debt, and the rest were supplemented by the method of credit expansion, issuing paper marks with no gold reserves. Germany's current dangerous fiscal policy is entirely dependent on the mysterious economic minister and president of the Deutsche Reichsbank, Dr. Schacht, and the strict policies of the National Socialist Party to barely maintain it.</p>
<p>After the expansion of armaments by various countries in continental Europe and the passage of Britain's large-scale military reorganization policy in parliament, the prices of non-ferrous metals necessary for the military industry in the international market have been affected and have continued to rise. The following is a comparison table of London market prices:</p>
<p>We speculate that the soaring prices of non-ferrous metals in the world are partly due to the opportunity for speculators to manipulate them, but the increase in consumption and the demand exceeding supply in the market is of course the main reason. The world's major steel producer is the United States. Since the implementation of the European arms race, Anaoonda's stock, which was worth less than five dollars when Roosevelt entered the White House, has now risen to fifty dollars. In just one and a half months in March, Britain ordered a huge amount of steel from the United States worth 40 million to 50 million yuan. Therefore, the US President declared: The soaring prices of non-ferrous metals in the world and the slow rise in wages mean that after prosperity (Boom), there will be panic (Krach). The remedy for this phenomenon lies in Europe. This further highlights the crisis of the arms race. France's financial stability has become extremely difficult due to its increased military spending. According to Premier Leon Blum's report: of every 100 francs of national treasury revenue, 42 francs are used to repay public debt, 27 francs are used for military needs, and the remaining 31 francs are used for all other government expenses. When the reporter filed this manuscript, the Leon Blum cabinet had already resigned due to financial problems. Germany, in addition to not allowing waste of all the gold used for military needs, is now lacking iron ore, so General Göring has had to start restricting the use of iron ore by other industries.</p>
<p>The rising prices of non-ferrous metals required for armaments are well known to us, but gold, which is valued by the world as a symbol of wealth and credit creation, is instead experiencing panic due to oversupply. The following table shows the phenomenon of the world's gold production, which has been increasing in recent years:</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Share the Spoils in the Davis Cup Challenge</h3>
<p>Austin and Budge Each Win a Singles Match</p>
<p>▲ (Central News Agency, London, 24th, Havas Telegram) The Davis Cup tennis championship challenge match between Britain and the United States began this afternoon in Wimbledon. In the first day of singles matches, Britain and the United States each won one set. The results are as follows:</p>
<h3>Recollections of the United States in the Decade Before the Davis Cup Final</h3>
<p>Predictions Give the United States a Five-to-One Advantage</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, London, 24th, Reuters Telegraph) The United States will compete with Britain today in the Davis Cup challenge to determine the champion. It is believed that the United States has a five-to-one advantage, as the British lineup this year is extremely weak and can hardly withstand the sharp-edged American team. The American team will be led by Wimbledon champion Budge, with Parker as the first singles player and Budge and Mako paired for doubles. When the United States and Germany held the inter-zone final, the American second singles player was originally Grant, but Grant was in very poor form, losing both matches and disappointing everyone. Therefore, Parker has been replaced this time. We should remember that in this year's Wimbledon men's singles competition, Budge was unstoppable and won the championship. Only Parker was able to win a set against him in the semi-finals. Therefore, Parker's strength is actually more abundant than Grant's.</p>
<p>The British team this year is incomplete due to Pan's entry into the professional field and Hughes' inability to play doubles due to illness. The championship will inevitably be handed over. The draw order for the three-day competition is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The last time the United States won the Davis Cup championship was in 1926. At that time, the United States had held the cup for seven consecutive years. It was not until 1927 that the Four Musketeers of France (Lacoste, Cochet, Borotra, and Brugnon) defeated the United States and took the Davis Cup across the Atlantic. Since then, the United States has reached the final week six times, but its wish to regain the cup has not been fulfilled.</p>
<p>In 1926, the United States defeated France 4-1, which was the last victory in keeping the Davis Cup. The results were as follows: In singles, Johnston defeated French players Lacoste and Borotra, Tilden defeated Borotra but lost to Lacoste. In doubles, Williams and Richards defeated French players Cochet and Brugnon.</p>
<p>By 1927, French players had made great progress. In the first singles, Lacoste defeated Johnston and Tilden. In the second singles, Cochet, although defeated by Tilden, defeated Johnston. In doubles, Borotra and Brugnon also defeated Tilden and Hunter in a five-set thriller. (Note: In 1933, Britain defeated France and won the Davis Cup, which it has held until this year.)</p>
<h3>Two Matches in the Mayor's Cup Minor Ball Tournament</h3>
<p>The second Mayor's Cup All-City Open Minor Ball Tournament was originally scheduled to end last week. However, two matches in the Wu-character group, namely Postal Workers vs. Samsung and Lion's Roar vs. Yi Ming, have not yet been held. They are now scheduled to be held at the Mackie Road court starting at 4:00 PM today.</p>
<h3>The 12th Wimbledon Tennis Championships of 1937</h3>
<p>— Our European Correspondent Lieshan</p>
<p>Day 10</p>
<p>As a result of today's women's singles matches, Polish player Ms. Jedrzejowska defeated American player Ms. Marble in straight sets. British player Ms. Round defeated French player Madame Mathieu, also in two sets. The defeats of Ms. Marble and Madame Mathieu were somewhat unexpected, but the two winners did have wonderful performances today. In particular, Ms. Round's hitting technique has the posture of a champion.</p>
<p>Marble Admits Defeat</p>
<p>Ms. Marble's defeat today is just like Ji Chengji's defeat to Mako. She could not exert her strengths, and her weaknesses were controlled by the enemy. Not only could her cannonball serve not overcome Ms. Jedrzejowska, but her weapon of rushing to the net also rarely had a chance to try because of the opponent's heavy strokes. As a result, she had to use the method of baseline strokes to defeat the enemy. In terms of stroke technique, Ms. Marble is naturally not as good as Ms. Jedrzejowska.</p>
<p>However, after watching this match, we know that the weight of the ball hit by a first-class female tennis player is definitely no less than that of a man. Ms. Jedrzejowska's forehand stroke is terrible. After the ball is hit, the racket seems to be about to crack. Every time she hits a wonderful ball, the audience exclaims in unison. The reporter heard several spectators constantly praising, "Is this kind of hit from a woman? What is the difference from a man?"</p>
<p>After the start of the first set, Ms. Marble's momentum was strong. Both sides used backhand strokes, but when the opportunity arose, Ms. Marble rushed to the net, thus scoring more points. She was first 4-2 ahead, then 5-3. She was only a little away from winning this set. However, at this critical moment, she was obviously a little flustered and repeatedly lost good opportunities. Her most reliable net interception in peacetime also lost its effect. Seeing 5-5, 6-6, she finally lost 6-8 instead. In this fierce battle, although she adopted an effective strategy, using the opponent's weakness in backhand strokes, Ms. Jedrzejowska's backhand stroke was unexpectedly excellent today, with no flaws. This is also considered Ms. Marble's misfortune. However, the general audience was satisfied, because this kind of wonderful tennis match is not easy to see at Wimbledon. Especially Ms. Jedrzejowska's name is not easy to pronounce. Every time the referee announced her name, it always caused a burst of laughter from the audience. Later, the referee kept shouting "Quiet!", but which spectator would listen to him? Everyone thought, how funny is the name Jedrzejowska, how can you stop people from laughing? (A digression - the transliteration of our country's Xu Chengji is also a mystery in the eyes of the British. He transliterated it into KhoSinKie according to the Xiamen dialect. This time he also wrote S.K.Kho. on the Wimbledon list. According to Ms. Round, when Xu Chengji and Mako were competing, an old English lady told her companion, "What a pity, choosing an A-class player from China to come here to fight his own people." This old lady could not see Mako's face clearly and only heard the referee's report. Mako and Yi Ge ("One Ge" in Chinese) thought that Mako was also Chinese.</p>
<p>In the second set, Ms. Marble was not as successful as in the first set, and made more mistakes in hitting the ball. Ms. Jedrzejowska's (Jedrzejowska) ball had more weight. It was the first time in the reporter's life that she had seen such weight on a female tennis player. The score between the two sides was first 2-0, then 5-2. Ms. Marble, to the regret of the audience, lost this set again. The score was 6-1. Ms. Jedrzejowska won and got the final women's singles final.</p>
<p>▲ Round is Impressive</p>
<p>Then Ms. Round and Madame Mathieu took the stage. Judging from today's tennis match, Ms. Round is undoubtedly the "dark horse" of this year's women's singles. She is an all-around female tennis player with no weaknesses. Perhaps only her backhand stroke is slightly worse. However, this cannot be her fatal flaw. Especially when dealing with Madame Mathieu, who cannot run, there are more methods of relief. After the start of the first set, it was almost whoever served lost. Madame Mathieu once led by a score of 3-1, but was quickly caught up by Ms. Round. The score turned to 5-3. Madame Mathieu then not only won one game, but also almost reached a score of 5-5 in the tenth game. At this time, the audience was worried about Ms. Round, perhaps she would have the same fate as Ms. Marble and be caught up by the opponent. However, Ms. Round has rich combat experience. She is much calmer than Ms. Marble. She finally won this game with a wonderful stroke, and also won this set. The score was 6-4.</p>
<p>In the second set, Ms. Round was able to use her hitting skills more freely. It seemed that wherever the ball was going, she could hit it as she pleased. She quickly took a 2-0 lead. At this time, Madame Mathieu lost a ball in vain due to a miscall by the linesman, and her spirit was naturally more affected. After that, Madame Mathieu seemed to have no intention of fighting and only wanted to end this match quickly. As a result, Ms. Round won the second set again with a score of 6-0.</p>
<p>The results of today's men's and women's doubles and mixed doubles matches will all reach the final stage. The only unexpected thing is that last year's women's doubles world champions, Ms. Stammers and Ms. James, lost to another British doubles pair, Mrs. King and Mrs. Winterbottom. The score was 1-6, 5-7. Ms. Stammers' hitting has not returned to normal after her illness, and Ms. James played even worse today, so they were finally eliminated in straight sets.</p>
<h3>Carson Wins Conti Beauty Cup Singles Final for Two Consecutive Years</h3>
<p>Wins Over Squires 3-1 in a Tense Match. The Collasa Couple Win Mixed Doubles</p>
<p>In the Conti Club Beauty Cup tennis singles final, Carson defeated Squires 3-1 yesterday to retain the championship. Squires has recently made rapid progress in his skills, defeating Collasa and Forbes in succession. His strength is strong and impressive. The match was difficult to break. At the start of the match, Squires took the lead and easily won the first set. Carson caught up to tie the score at one point each. At this time, Carson's hitting technique gradually improved, with powerful high shots and frequent feats, while Squires gradually felt physically exhausted, making many mistakes and being tied by Carson. In the second set, both sides performed well and the performance was wonderful, so the situation fluctuated and remained in stalemate for a long time. Carson finally relied on long shots to win again. In the fourth set, Squires was hoarse and exhausted, and had no ability to resist. Carson was able to easily win 6-1. As a result, Carson eliminated Squires 3-1 and retained this year's championship. Mr. Dai Genhua, the manager of the Huacheng Tobacco Company, which donated the cup, was unable to attend due to illness, so the club temporarily invited Miss Luo Feishi to present the awards. The champion and runner-up each received a silver cup. The champion, Carson, also retains the honor of the Beauty Cup for one year. Carson has now won the championship for two consecutive years. If he can retain the championship next year, Carson can keep the cup permanently. Another mixed doubles match was an exhibition match between Li Guofan and Miss Luo Feishi, and the Collasa couple, who were invited by the club. The strength of both sides was similar, and the match was evenly matched. The Collasa couple relied on their skilled partnership, while Li Luo was temporarily paired, so the Collasa couple won in straight sets. Today's order is empty. The semi-finals of the doubles tournament will be held starting tomorrow. The club has scheduled the semi-finals for the 29th and the championship final of the doubles tournament for the 30th. The results are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Last Night Japanese Marines Patrolled and Were on Alert at the End of Zhabei and North Sichuan Road</h3>
<p>It is Claimed That a Japanese Soldier Was Missing; The Situation Temporarily Became Quite Serious</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces stationed in Shanghai claimed again last night that a Japanese soldier was missing, and therefore dispatched troops to patrol and inspect pedestrians and vehicles, making the situation quite serious for a time. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Claim Soldier Missing</p>
<p>At 10 PM last night, two Japanese military officers went to the D'Isle Road Police Station claiming that during roll call of the Japanese Marines that evening, Private First Class Miyazaki was found missing, and requested an investigation. According to the two officers, a Japanese merchant named Okazaki passed by D'Isle Road that evening and saw a Japanese soldier fighting with two Chinese men. Then a car drove up and took the Japanese soldier and the two Chinese men away. After receiving the report, the police station immediately sent officers to investigate the alleged fight location. Nearby residents said that they had not seen a Japanese soldier fighting with Chinese men that evening. At the same time, our Chinese police authorities also sent personnel to investigate, but found nothing. However, after the two Japanese officers left the police station and returned to the Japanese Naval Landing Forces barracks, they immediately dispatched Marines to patrol in all directions, cut off traffic, and search pedestrians.</p>
<p>The Situation Became Quite Serious</p>
<p>At Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road, D'Isle Road, Seymour Road, and Jiangwan Road, more than a dozen Japanese Marines were stationed, inspecting pedestrians and vehicles very strictly. A small number of sentries were stationed near the Tiantong'an Road train station and the Yokohama Road area. Patrol teams and motorcycles equipped with machine guns were constantly moving back and forth in the North Sichuan Road area. For a time, rumors spread, the situation became tense, and residents were extremely panicked.</p>
<p>Mayor Negotiates by Phone</p>
<p>After learning of the situation, Acting Mayor Yu immediately contacted Japanese Consul General Okamoto by telephone, saying that the report of the missing Japanese soldier needed to be investigated to verify if it was true. The city government would also assist in the investigation to clarify the truth. The actions of the Marines only caused panic and affected the city's security. It was hoped that the consulate could stop such actions by the Marines. Okamoto replied that the actions of the Japanese Marines were solely for alert and vigilance and had no other intention, and asked not to be misunderstood. However, regarding the missing Japanese soldier, he requested that efforts be made to investigate the matter.</p>
<p>Military and Police Authorities Negotiate</p>
<p>The military camp authorities negotiated with the Japanese military regarding the deployment of Japanese Naval Landing Forces for patrol, requesting caution. The Japanese side replied that the deployment of the Marines was intended to search and be prepared, with no other intention, and hoped that the Chinese side would also exercise caution. According to our military and police authorities, the current situation is still peaceful, and our side has decided to take a calm and prudent approach to prevent the situation from escalating and deteriorating.</p>
<p>Inspection of Zhabei This Morning</p>
<p>At 2 AM this morning, our newspaper reporter made a special trip to Zhabei to inspect the situation. The reporter first went to the Sun Temple branch of the Xinzha Sub-bureau to inquire. According to the officer at the branch, the true situation was still unclear, and no other reports had been received. After the officer finished writing, he asked the reporter for his press pass. The reporter replied that he did not have it with him due to the suddenness of the matter. The officer then called our newspaper to confirm. Only after clarifying the situation did he answer other questions. At that time, the reporter expressed exceptional admiration for the officer's humble attitude and conscientious service. After the reporter finished talking, he left the bureau and patrolled eastward along Zhongxing Road. Groups of three or five people whispered privately in the streets, and the roadside checks were very strict. The security was especially tight at Huiwen Road, Hongxing Road, and from Xibao Road to Qingyun Bridge.</p>
<p>Situation Has Eased</p>
<p>At 4:30 AM this morning, the reporter went to various parts of Zhabei again for a final inspection. Compared to the situation at 11 PM last night and 2 AM this morning, the situation had greatly eased. The Japanese Marines on the opposite bank of the Yokohama River had mostly withdrawn, with only a very small number of sentries remaining.</p>
<h3>Movements of Prominent People</h3>
<p>Sun Ke and Chu Minyi left Nanjing by night train at 11 PM last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning.

<p>Telegram from the Postal Workers' Union</p>
<p>(1) To the postal workers' organizations throughout the country: Recently, the Japanese army in North China violated agreements and provoked incidents, attacking our Lugouqiao garrison and bombarding Wanping and its suburbs in an attempt to expand their occupied territory and annex North China. All Chinese people are deeply indignant. Fortunately, our 29th Army is loyal and brave in defending the country, resolutely resisting the war, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a statement on the 17th of this month, declaring national policy, stating that when the final moment comes, we must resolutely sacrifice and prepare for war. His words are righteous and the world is shaken. After feeling excited, we fully support Chairman Chiang's intentions and pledge our loyalty, ready to listen to the central government and be the vanguard for the country. We hereby state this clearly and hope for your response. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union. (2) To whom it may concern, the Japanese army in Tianjin has been inspecting postal items at the Hebei Postal Administration for days, insulting our country and undermining our sovereignty. All of us are deeply indignant. Our association has already petitioned the Ministry of Communications to actively negotiate and ensure that the inspection is stopped to maintain postal service and protect national sovereignty. We hope everyone will rise up together and vow to be the government's support. This is a request to all postal workers' organizations throughout the country. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union.</p>
<p>Youth National Salvation League</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Youth National Salvation League's Anti-Enemy Fundraising Committee has been working very hard. The committee recently stated that the situation in North China is still serious and that the soldiers at the front urgently need assistance. Fundraising efforts should continue actively, and representatives from various schools are working very hard. The results are still excellent, and another telegram was sent to the soldiers of the 29th Army, urging them not to be taken advantage of by the enemy and to properly negotiate without humiliation. The original telegram is as follows: To the entire 29th Army in Beiping, the enemy has amassed a large army, threatening to form an alliance under the city. The territory and sovereignty of North China are in imminent danger. This is the moment when our nation and our country's life and death depend. The youth of the southeast are all filled with righteous indignation and want to take up arms to defend the country. Your patriotic deeds are glorious in history. We hope you will continue your efforts and be the first for the people. Today, if there is a new compromise, it will be a humiliation to the country. You must force the enemy to quickly withdraw its troops, which is the only way to survive. Success or failure, honor or disgrace, all depend on this. Protests are ineffective, so start fighting! Wait for ten years, and the violent Japanese will surely perish. The 100,000 youths of Shanghai are willing to follow you and die on the battlefield, all becoming heroic ghosts. We are saddened and don't know what to say. Shanghai Youth United National Salvation League.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of the National Medical Association</p>
<p>In light of the Lugouqiao Incident, the rampant actions of the violent Japanese, the attacks on our garrisons, and the forcible occupation of our territory, the National Medical Association of the city believes that the national crisis is severe and has reached its final stage. Although the atmosphere of peace is strong, the Japanese army continues to increase its forces. The soldiers at the front are bravely defending the country and resisting the war, and the people in the rear should do their best to assist. Therefore, an emergency standing committee meeting was convened last night to discuss the methods of implementation. The following resolutions were adopted: (1) Notify all members to save money and donate to the association, which will forward the funds to the front lines. (2) Nominate Zhu Hegao, Shi Jiqun, and Tang Jifu as representatives to participate in the city's Anti-Enemy Support Association. (3) Unite the city's medical organizations to form a relief team to be sent to the front lines in case the war expands.</p>
<h3>Train Service Between Shanghai and Peiping Has Not Been Restored Yet</h3>
<p>Service Still Only Goes to Tianjin</p>
<p>Train service between Shanghai and Peiping was interrupted after the Lugouqiao Incident. Service was briefly restored but then interrupted again. Now that the frontline troops have withdrawn, the line should be able to resume service soon. However, a reporter from the Shenshi News Agency learned from the Railway Bureau on the morning of the 24th that joint tickets are still only being sold to Tianjin and tickets to Peiping are not being sold yet. When service can be restored is still difficult to predict, but it is understood that the situation in the front is gradually becoming peaceful, so passengers may be able to continue on to Peiping by taking the Beining train there when they arrive in Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Cattle and Sheep Industry Requests Exemption from Slaughter Tax; Two Petitions to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Ministries of Finance and Industry Decide on a Compromise Solution; Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval and Implementation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Industry Association believes that it cannot bear the burden of the municipal government's Finance Bureau's proposed cattle slaughter tax. Its first petition did not achieve its objective. Furthermore, recently, cattle from the north have been purchased in Qingdao by people of a certain country for large-scale slaughter and storage as military supplies. The source of cattle in Shanghai has decreased sharply, market prices have soared, and the entire industry is suffering losses. Adding a slaughter tax now would be like throwing stones down a well, hastening its bankruptcy. Therefore, Yang Zhaosheng and two others were sent to Nanjing for a second petition the day before yesterday. The representatives returned to Shanghai yesterday. To clarify the results of the petition, the reporter went to interview them. According to the representatives, at 9 AM on the 19th, they first went to the Executive Yuan and were received by Secretary Zhang, who said that the case had been submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Industry for consultation. Then they went to the Ministry of Industry and were received by Secretary Jin and Section Chief Liu, who said that the case was being decided by the Ministry of Finance and was still under discussion. Finally, they went to the Ministry of Finance and were received by Tax Division staff member Chen Li, who said that the case had been jointly submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval by the Ministry of Industry. In order to take into account the suffering of the merchants, a compromise solution had been determined. After the representatives stated the reasons for the petition and pleaded for the rejection of the existing resolution, Section Chief Chen replied that a decision would be made after the Executive Yuan approved it. It is heard that if the second petition fails to achieve its objective, a third petition will be made, determined to persist to the end.</p>
<h3>Measures for Issuing Nationality Certificates to Naturalized Citizens and Those Who Have Regained Citizenship</h3>
<p>City Government Orders Police Bureau to Comply</p>
<p>The city government issued an order yesterday to the Police Bureau stating that it had received a dispatch from the Ministry of Interior regarding the issuance of nationality certificates to the wives and children of naturalized citizens and those who have regained citizenship, as well as those who have acquired citizenship due to marriage, adoption, recognition, and other relationships, in order to prove their nationality. A simplified procedure has been formulated whereby the person applying for the nationality certificate (or their parents on their behalf if they are underage) must prepare a handling fee of 60 cents in national currency, two recent 4x6 cm half-length photos, and a written application, which must be filled out in Chinese and foreign languages according to the prescribed format. The application must be submitted to the local government of the applicant's current residence, which will then forward it to the Ministry of Interior for direct issuance to facilitate verification. The order instructs the Police Bureau to comply.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Merchant Xiong Fei Talks About Promoting National Porcelain</h3>
<p>Business in Singapore is Gradually Improving; Overseas Chinese Enthusiastically Donate to Resist the Enemy</p>
<p>Xiong Fei, a leader of the overseas Chinese merchants in Singapore, returned to China in early April to investigate national porcelain. He went to Jiangxi, stayed in Ganzhou for two months, and then went to Hankou before coming to Shanghai via Nanjing. Xiong said that business in Singapore is improving daily and encouraged Chinese people to go there to do business and develop the market for national products. The reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Investigating and Purchasing Jiangxi National Porcelain</p>
<p>Xiong returned to China this time to purchase Jiangxi national porcelain and investigate the status of the porcelain industry there. After returning to China, he immediately went to Jiangxi Province and stayed there for two months. He said that the materials of Jiangxi porcelain are very good and better than foreign products, but the designs still need to be improved. He purchased a large quantity of porcelain in Jiangxi and plans to ship it to Singapore for trial sales. In the future, he plans to ship more to Singapore. There are many overseas Chinese in Singapore, and they all love to use national products. The southward sales of national porcelain will not be a problem in the future. Especially recently, the Guangda Porcelain Company was established in Jiangxi Province, using scientific methods to produce porcelain and increase production. The improved products are good news for our overseas Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>Encouraging Chinese People to Do Business in Singapore</p>
<p>Xiong also talked about the recent situation of overseas Chinese business in Singapore, saying that Singapore is a major port in Southeast Asia, and most of our overseas Chinese reside on the island. Doing business there is more promising than in other places. In the past year or two, due to the rising prices of rubber and tin ore, the commercial market has been booming. Whether or not various businesses in Singapore are prosperous depends on the rise and fall of local products, so the overseas Chinese economy has also improved significantly. The Singapore market for national products can be greatly developed. Therefore, this time, he took the opportunity to encourage Chinese people to go there to do business and jointly develop overseas sales channels. At the same time, to encourage Jiangxi merchants to go to Singapore, the Jiangxi Fellow Association in Singapore also plans to expand its business this year and build a three-story Western-style building, for which it has already hired someone to draw up plans. It will cost about 40,000 yuan. A portion of the money has already been raised. This time, Chairman Xiong returned to Jiangxi and was very concerned about the self-built guild halls of our overseas Chinese, believing that they can unite the feelings of overseas Chinese and develop international trade. He automatically donated construction funds to show his support.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Raise Funds to Overcome National Difficulties</p>
<p>Xiong has been in Singapore for 30 years and also serves as the Director of the Jiangxi Fellow Association. He is very familiar with the situation of overseas Chinese. Speaking of the situation of overseas Chinese toward the motherland, he said that overseas Chinese work hard overseas, and their destination and wishes are in the motherland. Overseas Chinese have always been able to do their best to support domestic construction, warning each other that "without a country, there is no home." This time, the Japanese caused the Lugouqiao Incident, which is truly regrettable. He had already returned to China at that time and believes that the emotions of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia must be very tense again. When the reporter asked about the ban on overseas Chinese fundraising by the Singapore authorities, Xiong said that according to past experience, there have been cases of overseas Chinese being banned from donating for war, but their patriotic feelings are still enthusiastically encouraged. Therefore, each time, overseas Chinese donate automatically, without the need for solicitations. It is expected that this time, although fundraising to resist the enemy has been banned again, the results will still be considerable.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Silk Factories Run Out of Raw Materials; Association Issues Statement of Appeal Yesterday</h3>
<p>Factories Selling Forward Contracts Cannot Deliver; Silk Workers Held Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Relief</p>
<p>Since the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang banned the export of dry cocoons and announced measures for managing silkworm rearing, silk factories such as Yuanchang and Hetai were forced to shut down yesterday. The Tongle Association issued a statement yesterday appealing to all sectors and decided to petition the municipal government tomorrow. Silk workers in the city held a general meeting yesterday to discuss relief. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Forced Shutdown</p>
<p>Since the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang banned the export of dry cocoons, the various silk factories in the city have been unable to transport the dry cocoons that they have already collected and stored in Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places to Shanghai, resulting in a shortage of raw materials and panic. They jointly requested relief from the industry association. The Yuanchang Silk Factory in Erjiawan, Zhabei, with 120 machines, and the Hetai Silk Factory, with 120 machines, were the first to be forced to announce their shutdown at 1 PM yesterday. In addition, the raw material stocks of factories such as Fuxing, Xinchang, Gufeng, Dongyi, and Jincheng are running out and they will soon be forced to shut down as well.</p>
<p>Association Petitions</p>
<p>The Silk Factory Industry Association, after a general meeting, decided that at 9 AM tomorrow (Monday), representatives Shen Lianchen, Zhang Peishen, Tang Zhiqin, Xu Peixiong, and eight others will be sent to petition the Social Affairs Bureau of the municipal government and the municipal party headquarters to report everything in person and request that the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang be consulted immediately to rescind the ban on silkworm and silk reeling equipment and machinery and to abolish Article 6 of the silkworm rearing management measures (i.e., the restriction on silkworm rearing) in order to save the national industry and prevent the unemployment of tens of thousands of workers. They are scheduled to gather at the industry association at 8:30 AM on the same morning.</p>
<p>Delivery Conflicts</p>
<p>The various silk factories in Shanghai that have sold forward contracts for near-term silk and are due to deliver the goods will inevitably be unable to fulfill the deliveries due to the exhaustion of raw materials. After receiving reports from member silk factories, the Silk Factory Industry Association issued a statement to the Raw Silk Export Association. Wax Feng, Chairman of the Export Association, considered the matter to be of great importance and sent a secretary yesterday to contact Shen Lianchen, Chairman of the Silk Factory Industry Association, requesting that the factories fulfill their deliveries according to the contracts. Chairman Shen replied that unless the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang rescind the ban, so that the raw material supply of silk in Shanghai is not cut off, it will be difficult to fulfill the deliveries.</p>
<p>Workers' Meeting</p>
<p>The silk industry unions of the 4th and 6th districts stated that the ban on the export of dry cocoons from the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which in effect dictates that Zhejiang cocoons must be reeled in Zhejiang and Jiangsu cocoons must be reeled in Jiangsu, has caused the dry cocoons purchased and stored by Shanghai silk merchants to be banned from transport. As a result, the raw materials of the city's silk reeling factories are running out and they will soon be forced to shut down within a month. The silk reeling workers throughout the city are therefore panicking greatly. A joint meeting of representatives was held at 2 PM yesterday at the Huaxing branch of the 4th District Union on Zhaotong Road. Union members Yuan Yunlong, Yang Gengti, Liu Sanzhi, and others from the 6th district union, Chen Xiupu, Yang Hongmei, Zhu Yi, and others from the 4th district union, and all 30+ directors and supervisors attended. Chairman Chen Xiupu resolved to: (1) Hold a joint representative meeting of silk reeling workers throughout the city on the morning of July 27 to discuss everything. (2) Issue an appeal and elect Chen Xiupu and Yuan Yunlong to draft a declaration. (3) Have all the directors and supervisors of the two unions go to the municipal party headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the General Labor Union on a regular basis to appeal. (4) Organize a joint office of the silk reeling party and labor unions throughout the city to unify steps and facilitate everything. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were made.</p>

<h3>Tajiri Returns to Shanghai After Completing Northern Mission;</h3>
<p>Gado Cancels Trip to Tianjin</p>

<h3>Foreign Firms Temporarily Suspend Insurance on Sino-Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Insurance Premiums for War Risk Doubled Along China's Coast; Chinese Insurers to Discuss Limitations</p>
<p>In light of the severe situation in North China and the possibility of escalated conflict at any moment, Chinese and foreign insurance companies in this city have been exchanging views on the issue of war risk insurance. It is reported that foreign insurance companies have already begun to double the war risk insurance premiums for goods carried on ships along the Chinese coast, the Yangtze River, and in Hong Kong. They have also temporarily suspended insurance on goods carried on Chinese and Japanese ships. A reporter from the New News Agency visited the person in charge of the local insurance association. According to them, international war risk insurance, with the exception of North America (the United States and Canada), was suspended in February of this year. Germany has also canceled war risk insurance for the Far East. The reason for the suspension by various countries is due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, which caused huge losses to people's lives and property. War risk insurance companies suffered severe blows and were unable to sustain operations, causing great turmoil in the London market. Therefore, all countries agreed to cease operations. War risk insurance originally included riot and disturbance insurance, focusing on losses caused by local emergencies, rather than losses caused by wars between countries. Our association has discussed war risk insurance with the local foreign merchant association. The foreign fire insurance association is scheduled to convene a general meeting of members on the 30th of this month, and the Chinese insurance association is also scheduled to convene a regular meeting of members on August 2nd to conduct a thorough study and discussion on the issue of war risk insurance before making a decision.</p>

<h3>Fecal Examination Results Show Not True Cholera</h3>
<p>Harbor Quarantine Office Announces Results; Typhoid Fever Rampant in the City</p>
<p>The Harbor Quarantine Office announced the results of the first cholera germ test of the year yesterday, which showed it was not true cholera. This confirms that no cholera has been found in the country this year. The details are as follows: The Harbor Quarantine Office reported an outbreak of cholera in Ningbo, but whether it was true needed to be verified. Therefore, it immediately asked the Sino-American Hospital in Ningbo to send a sealed letter to Shanghai with the patient's feces, kept in cold water. The office handed it over to the Wusong Second Hospital for testing. After testing by Dr. Boleis of the hospital, the results were announced yesterday afternoon, confirming that it was not true cholera. It is believed that the reason for the suspicion in Ningbo was due to the extreme similarity of clinical symptoms. According to the Harbor Quarantine Office, typhoid fever has been rampant in the city in the past week, with a high mortality rate. There were 27 cases of typhoid fever among Chinese, with 20 deaths, and 3 cases among foreigners, with one death. At the same time, dysentery symptoms were also prevalent in Hankou, with more cases than in Shanghai. In Hankou, there were 23 cases of dysentery among Chinese in the past week, while there were only 17 cases in Shanghai, including 3 among foreigners.</p>

The six-year deadline for opium prohibition is also approaching. In Shanghai, Chinese and foreigners live together, and opium addiction is rampant. In Zhejiang Province, the remaining opium addiction has not been eradicated. Despite repeated strict prohibitions issued by the provincial and municipal governments, ignorant people still violate the bans. As the special commissioner, this causes me great concern. This proclamation is issued to inform all people in Zhejiang and Shanghai. If any illegal elements dare to privately sell or smoke opium, they will be handed over to the military law authorities for strict punishment in accordance with the law, without leniency. Obey this order, and do not violate it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Employees Apprehend Wanted Criminals</h3>
<p>Unauthorized Surveying of Important Bridges Along the Route; Admitted to Acting Under Instructions from a Certain Party</p>
<p>On the evening of the 23rd, around 6 PM, four people with suspicious behavior were found surveying around the tracks of Bridge No. 31 and Bridge No. 34 between Songjiang and Shihudang stations on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway (Note: These two bridges are important and relatively large bridges on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway). Railway employees and soldiers discovered them and immediately arrested them. They were taken to the Songjiang District Command for interrogation. One of the criminals claimed to be a resident of Jiaxing. At the same time, a detective from the Jiaxing Police Station was present and took him away for investigation. After a thorough interrogation, seven more people were apprehended. They all admitted to acting under the instructions of a certain party, with the organization based in Shanghai. They also claimed that there were a total of twenty people, some of whom were not yet adults and worked as iron menders and bowl repairers. Each person was given fourteen yuan before departure as a family allowance. The case is currently being jointly investigated by the military and police authorities in Jiaxing and Songjiang, and the accomplices are being pursued and brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Third Concubine of Wu Guangzong Sues Second Concubine for Embezzling Huge Sum of Inheritance</h3>
<p>Case Still Under Investigation; Hearing Postponed</p>
<p>Wu Guangzong, a native of Fujian who served as chief of staff and director of the Hydrographic Survey Bureau under Sun Chuanfang, the warlord commander of the Five Provinces Allied Army, was assassinated in Shanghai in August of the 31st year, leaving behind an inheritance of over 600,000 yuan. The inheritance was managed by his second concubine, Wu Zhang Yuqing. His third concubine, Ying Zhong Hui Zhen, was in Fujian, and his legal wife, Lin Zhuzui, was also not in Shanghai, leading to a property dispute among the wives and concubines. A custody committee was formed by relatives and friends, including current Deputy Minister of the Navy Li Shijia and Jiangnan Shipyard Director Ma Boliang. However, lawyer Shen Yuesheng embezzled over 100,000 yuan and fled, leading to years of litigation. Now, Wu Zhong Huizhen, along with her son, filed a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Criminal Division against Wu Zhang Yuqing for valuing the inheritance, requesting that the entire property be handed over for distribution in four shares to be inherited by Wu Guangzong's three sons and one daughter (the eldest son, Shi Qiang, and his wife, Xiu Yu, are the children of the legal wife Lin, the second son, Shi Yue, is the son of the defendant, and the third son, Bao Jun, is the son of the plaintiff). After Qiu, the judge, repeatedly opened the court for interrogation, both parties held their own views, and the defendant denied embezzlement. The court postponed the hearing for investigation. The previous report has recorded all this information. Now, during the postponement, the court found a deposit in the name of Wu Baojun at the Datong Bank, and Wu Guangzong's family members presented 11,000 yuan. The case was heard again yesterday morning, but the plaintiff did not arrive. The defendant's lawyer stated that they denied withdrawing money from Datong Bank in Wu Baojun's name. The court found that the case still needed investigation and postponed the hearing to August 5th.</p>
<h3>Lihang Municipal Committee Requests the Establishment of a Clinic</h3>
<p>Requests the Municipal Government to Order the Health Bureau to Rescind Its Decision</p>
<p>Zhang Qiwen of the Lihang District Municipal Committee, because the Municipal Health Bureau planned to close the clinic in the district, requested the Municipal Government to order the Health Bureau to rescind its decision in order to emphasize rural construction and public health. The original petition is recorded as follows: "In order to improve the health of the people in the district, the committee plans to use the remaining funds from the temporary epidemic hospital to purchase a piece of land north of the Xinlu Station and on the left side of Qixiu Road, donating it to the Health Bureau as the site for a rural hospital in the district. Before the hospital is established, please first set up a health office or clinic to pay attention to epidemic prevention in summer and autumn, diagnose and treat diseases for the people at ordinary times, and pay attention to midwifery, to meet the special health needs of the people in this area. Health Bureau Director Li sent personnel to the countryside for investigation and personally inspected the site, considering it appropriate. It was then reported to your office for approval to establish a clinic. The clinic has been established for several months and has diagnosed and treated diseases for the people, vaccinated against smallpox and measles, and injected preventive vaccines, for no fewer than six or seven thousand people. Even the clean-up of sanitary administration is more advanced than before. The people unanimously praised it, saying that this facility of the Health Bureau is truly the pioneer of all rural construction. However, recently, the Health Bureau decided at a bureau meeting to close the clinic from August 1st. After careful consideration, the committee believes that there are four reasons why it is not feasible. The district purchased land to assist in the establishment of the clinic as a base, and the committee reported it to your office for approval by the Health Bureau. It also plans to continue to raise funds to build a clinic, using the situation of the Health Bureau and your office building the countryside to promote it to the people as much as possible. The people in the district, almost all women and children, know this. If it is suddenly closed, the administrative credibility will be greatly lost, and it will be more difficult to organize public welfare in the future. This is the first reason why it is not feasible. The number of people receiving treatment when the clinic first opened was not very large, and some thought that the expenditure was not economical. However, rural undertakings are generally not very developed when they are first started, and they must go through considerable efforts and a considerable period of time before they can be expected to flourish. If we want to strictly demand economic efficiency at the beginning of the establishment, then the rural people will ultimately not be able to enjoy the same benefits as the urban people. This does not conform to reason and is not feasible. Moreover, the clinic's mission, as determined in the original plan, includes the prevention and control of epidemics, attention to midwifery, the dissemination of health knowledge, and the promotion of sanitary administration. Treating diseases is only one of the missions. It seems that it is not possible to dismiss it based on the small number of people receiving treatment and stop its operation. If the Health Bureau really wants to seek a large number of people to receive treatment in order to achieve economic efficiency, it should also enrich its content from a positive aspect to increase public faith, rather than suddenly stopping its operation from a negative aspect, cutting off the sprouts of the health undertakings of the people in this area. This is the second reason why it is not feasible. In modern times, if a country wants to prosper and compete with the rich and powerful countries of the world, it must increase the health of all people, enlighten the knowledge of all people, and enrich the economy of all people. Therefore, the central government has repeatedly declared that it hopes that the rural areas across the country will work hard to build, and health undertakings are one of the important tasks to improve the countryside and increase the strength of all people.

<h3>Weather Dry and Farmers Busy with Water Lifting</h3>
<p>The weather has been dry recently, and the farmland is in great need of water, especially cotton. Generally, farmers are busy lifting water to irrigate their fields. The suburbs were originally a watermelon-producing area, and it is now the ripening season. Due to the lack of water, they have not been as plump as in previous years, but the sweetness has increased a lot.</p>
<h3>工部局刑事科破獲偽造紙幣機關</h3>
<p>A Counterfeit Currency Ring Busted by the Criminal Division of the Municipal Council</p>
<p>Ten Chinese and Japanese Criminals Arrested; Counterfeiting of Five-Yuan National Currency of the Bank of China; Japanese Criminals to be Transferred to Nagasaki for Trial</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury," the Criminal Division of the Municipal Council received a tip-off several days ago, stating that a counterfeit currency operation was located somewhere in Hongkou. A certain Mr. [name], who was selling counterfeit five-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China, resided at 610 Wusong Road. A Chinese deputy detective was dispatched, posing as a buyer, to negotiate with the counterfeiters. After lengthy discussions, a price of seventeen yuan per hundred yuan of counterfeit currency was agreed upon. When the counterfeiters handed over two thousand yuan worth of counterfeit five-yuan banknotes, four Japanese and two suspected Chinese criminals were apprehended in a house on Jing'an Temple Road. A printing press, codebooks, and six printing plates for Guangdong Bank banknotes were seized at Seward Road. It was also learned that a certain Chinese man, who was managing and distributing these counterfeit banknotes, was going to a certain house in the French Concession. Detectives waited at the location and arrested the man when he arrived on Friday afternoon. In addition, one Japanese man and one Chinese man and one Chinese woman were arrested at that location. During the night, another printing press, a cutting machine, and a quantity of counterfeit Guangdong Bank banknotes were seized in a house in Zhabei. A total of ten Chinese and Japanese individuals were arrested. The police are still searching for other accomplices. According to the arrested criminals, they had shipped 20,000 yuan worth of counterfeit one-yuan Guangdong Bank banknotes to Guangzhou three weeks ago, and it is believed that these banknotes have already been circulated in the market. These counterfeit banknotes were sold in Shanghai to a certain person at a price of fourteen yuan per thousand, and then resold by that person to another person at a price of sixteen or seventeen yuan per thousand. Therefore, it is difficult for the police to find the mastermind of the case. The arrested Chinese individuals have been interrogated by the First Special District Court and ordered to be detained pending further investigation. It is reported that the Japanese individuals will be transferred to Nagasaki for trial, as counterfeiting currency is a serious crime under Japanese law, and the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai can only handle cases punishable by imprisonment of one year or less. According to the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun," the Municipal Council arrested six counterfeiters at 6:30 AM on the 2nd and 12th on Seward Road, Chapoo Road, and Jing'an Temple Road. The arrested included Japanese nationals Nobukata Ishii, Masatsugu Shimada, Gihei Yoneyama, and Hideo Wadamoto, as well as Chinese nationals Yuqing Zhou and Bing Liu. Two printing presses, two thousand yuan in counterfeit currency, and steel plates were confiscated. The main suspect, a Cantonese man named Zhu, has reportedly fled. It is claimed that this counterfeit ring counterfeited 30,000 yuan worth of five-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China.</p>
<h3>暨大請樊仲雲講‘最近的華北’</h3>
<p>Jinan University Invites Fan Zhongyun to Lecture on "Recent Developments in North China"</p>
<p>The students remaining at National Jinan University during the summer vacation, in light of the tense situation in North China and the repeated violations of agreements by the violent Japanese, formed the "Aid North China Soldiers in Resistance Against the Enemy Association" the other day. Since its establishment, the work has been extremely intense. Yesterday, the association, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the Chinese issue, invited former professor of the university, Fan Zhongyun, to give a lecture titled "Recent Developments in North China." More than two hundred students remaining at the school attended the lecture. Xu Dahua gave an introductory speech, followed by Fan's account of the occurrence of the North China Incident, which was by no means accidental. The Lugouqiao Incident concerns the survival of Beiping and Tianjin. We must strengthen our capabilities; only with fighting power can we speak of peace. To speak of peace without fighting power is surrender. The lecture lasted for one and a half hours, and the audience was deeply moved.</p>

<h3>黃包車商之子被綁釋回供述歷險經過</h3>
<p>Son of Rickshaw Businessman Released After Abduction Recounts His Ordeal</p>
<p>Moved to Several Counties in Over Twenty Days; Zhou Changgui Attempts to Evade Responsibility in Abduction Case; Only Admits to Participating in the Robbery on Boone Road</p>
<p>Lu Changsheng, (deceased) residing at No. 1, Lane 59, Rehe Road, made a living by managing rickshaws. His nine-year-old son, Deming, attended the nearby Nanyang Elementary School. On the 25th of last month, at 7:15 AM, Lu Deming, accompanied by his maid, Zhu Jinshi, was on his way to school when he was suddenly abducted by bandits who forced him into a car and sped away. Subsequently, Lu's family reported the incident to the police at the Mixed Court. Chinese Detective Sergeant Shang Wu, Detectives Li Wenbin, Ji Xiujuan, and others successively arrested suspects Zhou Changgui, Yao Fuquan, Liu Ruan (Zhou's mistress), Lu Shougong, and others from Jiangbei. Zhou, fearing punishment, attempted suicide in the police detention center by stabbing his temples with bamboo chopsticks. He was sent to the hospital for treatment and then interrogated after recovery. The hostage, Lu Deming, was suddenly returned by the bandits in a hired car on the 15th of this month, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Zhou Changgui, having recovered from his injuries, was, along with the other three suspects, brought to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Court Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that during the rescheduling process, it was found that Yao Fuquan and Liu Ruan were not involved and would not be prosecuted. Zhou Changgui and Lu Shougong were prosecuted for extortion under Article 347 of the Criminal Code. It was also found that on January 31, 1935, Zhou, armed with weapons, led a gang to rob the home of Yao Guo at No. 24, Lane 228, Boone Road, stealing property worth 305 yuan. He was also prosecuted under Article 330 of the Criminal Code. He stated the case that after Lu Deming was abducted and reported to the police, an investigation began, revealing that at 6:00 AM that morning, the bandits had rented a car (license number 4533) No. 18055 from the Hetong Motor Company on Shantou Road, driven by driver Hua Yeheng. When the car reached a deserted area on Xishixing Road in Zhabei, the bandits tied up Hua, threw him out, and tied him to a bamboo fence. One of the bandits drove off in the car. Afterwards, the driver shouted for help and was rescued by passersby, who reported the incident to the nearby police station. The stolen car was found on Dongshixing Road at around 10:00 AM that morning. The police arrested Zhou Changgui and later Lu Shougong and the other three. Driver Hua Yeheng identified Zhou as the one who had tied him up in the car and held a pistol. While the police were searching for the hostage, he was unexpectedly released and sent home on the 15th of this month. According to Lu Deming's statement to the police, after being abducted, he was taken to a grass hut by a river. At midnight, one of the bandits took him to the train station, where they boarded a train to Changzhou and stayed for six days. They then went to Yongle Rice Shop in Taixian, Jiangbei, and stayed for seven days. He was returned to Shanghai and stayed at Yongle Village for four days, then taken to No. 72, Mingxing Bridge, Songjiang, for four days. He was brought back to Shanghai by public bus. At Nanyang Bridge, the bandit hired a rickshaw to take him home. While he was in the bandits' lair, he was treated well and given one yuan for personal use each day, but when he was released, the money given to him was taken back. A silk handkerchief that Lu Deming had when he was abducted was found in Zhou's home at No. 15, Lane 176, Chongqing Road, inside a shirt pocket hanging on the wall. Since the hostage was abducted for no reason, it should be investigated whether his family paid a ransom for his release. As for the robbery on Boone Road, the fingerprints left by the bandits at the time matched Zhou Changgui's fingerprints. However, because the fingerprint report is not yet complete, a request for rescheduling is made. Afterwards, Lu Deming described the circumstances of his abduction, but he could not identify the two defendants who had been arrested. Hua Yeheng testified that Zhou Changgui was the bandit who had tied him up and held a pistol. When questioned, Zhou Changgui evaded responsibility for the abduction case but admitted to participating in the robbery on Boone Road. Lu Shougong vehemently denied the charges. Judge Fu Lin reviewed the statements and ordered the defendants Lu Shougong and Zhou Changgui to be remanded in custody for a hearing next Thursday morning.</p>
<h3>魚販夾運私鹽案辯論終結候判</h3>
<p>Fishmongers Smuggling Salt Case Arguments Concluded, Awaiting Judgment</p>
<p>Prosecuted under the Law for Punishing Salt Smuggling</p>
<p>Fishmongers Li Zongyuan and Zhong Deming brought shellfish and razor clams from Kanmen, Zhejiang, to Shanghai on the Xinhai Men Steamer on the 23rd of last month for sale. At the same time, they also smuggled four baskets of salt, weighing over eight hundred catties, on behalf of a fellow passenger, Wu Fumu (alias Wu Mumu). They delivered the goods to Taichang Fish Market and instructed the head clerk, Lin Xiangfa, to bring them into the market for sale. However, the market owner, Xu Yangxian, discovered that the upper layer of each basket was fish and the lower layer was salt. He reported the matter to the Mountain Police Sub-Bureau and the Fifth Jiangsu Tax Police Bureau, who sent officers to detain the people and goods and transfer them to the local court for investigation. During interrogation by Prosecutor Li, the defendants, Li Zongyuan and others, claimed that Wu Fumu had asked them on the ship to notify him, and that they were unaware of the contents. However, the market owner, Xu Yangxian, testified that before the discovery, the defendants only referred to the owner of the goods as a "current customer" and did not clearly state his name. After the discovery, they pleaded with the market owner to return the goods and not report the matter, so he was deemed to have knowingly committed the crime. They were prosecuted under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Law for Punishing Salt Smuggling. Yesterday, Judge Lu presided over the hearing. The defendants were defended by lawyer Xiang Xun, while the market owner, Xu Yangxian, testified that after the discovery, the defendants requested the return of the goods, and because he feared responsibility for the market, he reported the matter to the police for investigation. Wang Wenqing, the purser of the Xinhai Men Steamer, testified that the defendants did not declare the goods and that they were unaware of the situation, otherwise they would have charged them freight fees. The court adjourned the arguments and will announce the judgment at a later date.</p>

<p>Flour Exports - Quantity Issues, Spot Sales Active</p>
<p>On the 16th of this month, the Customs received an order from the Ministry of Finance to prohibit the export of flour. As a result, flour exports have virtually ceased for the past week. The day before yesterday (the 23rd), the Customs received a new directive from the Ministry of Finance, issuing new measures regarding the prohibition of flour exports. "Namely, with the exception of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang (the three northeastern provinces), including Dalian," exports to these areas are prohibited, while all other ports are to be unblocked. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Upon learning this, various merchant guilds rushed to shipping companies yesterday to report shipments, with a total of more than 100,000 bags. Unexpectedly, the Customs then announced that exports from Shanghai would be limited to 45,000 bags per day, causing renewed panic among the merchants, who requested an increase in the quota. The Customs agreed to request instructions from above. Today is a weekly holiday, so the matter can only be resolved tomorrow. Today, shipments have already been made, including 8,000 bags on the Fusheng ship bound for Tianjin, and 20,050 bags on the Xinming ship bound for Fuzhou. It is also heard that the new ban includes a prohibition on the export of bran to foreign countries. It is well known that bran and soybean cake meal are primarily needed by Japan, with astonishing quantities being shipped there annually. Other countries have never been known to purchase them, so this ban will have a considerable impact on Japan.</p>
<p>The benchmark markets for flour and wheat remained open yesterday at the limited prices, with no change. As for spot market conditions, trading has commenced and is quite active, as flour can now be shipped as usual, except to the three northeastern provinces and Dalian ports. However, consignees must provide written guarantees before shipments can be reported. Bran, whether for export or transshipment, remains prohibited. Therefore, factories are still quoting 4.30 yuan for spot goods, with no sign of easing. As for wheat, medium-grade remains stable, while high-grade is slightly tight. Six-He wheat opened at 6.05 yuan, Xuancheng wheat at 6.04 yuan, Dongge wheat at 6.09 yuan, Huaian wheat at 6.08 yuan and 6.03 yuan for the second grade, Xiangnan wheat at 5.912 yuan, Wuxi wheat at 6.10 yuan and 6.09 yuan, Wenzhou wheat at 6.00 yuan, Hankou large-grain wheat at 5.97 yuan, and Yangzhou wheat at 6.05 yuan. Fuxin processed 6,000 bags, and Shenda processed 1,000 bags, it is said.</p>
<p>Shanghai Rice Stocks Amount to Approximately 480,000 Bags</p>
<p>In Shanghai, during this extraordinary period, the most important preparation work is whether the people's food supply is sufficient. This issue has long been a cause for concern, but the results of general large-scale estimates suggest that the city's stocks are only sufficient for a couple of months, and accurate statistics are still lacking. The grain industry lacks investigative organizations, and no official announcements have been made. There is an urgent need for these statistics for public reference, and it is an issue that cannot be delayed. Therefore, we are specifically listing the recent (23rd) rice stock quantities in various warehouses in the city based on our investigation:</p>
<p>Rice Industry Unites Not to Aid the Enemy</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 3,400 to 3,500 shi of goods arrived from various guilds. Sales in the street market remained sluggish, so few transactions were made. Only the Qingdao and Tianjin guilds sold just over 600 bags of Bo Dao rice. Merchants from Qinhuangdao, Dalian, Yingkou, Andong, and other guilds maintained an absolute refusal to trade, so although the goods arriving were not numerous, the market remained stable. The prices of thick and thin Japonica rice showed no gains or losses. Du Yangjian and Yin Bian Yuan were also stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about ten rice boats from various waterways downstream of the river arrived at the閘. The market opened in the morning, and merchants took some goods, but prices remained soft. Later, as customer sentiment strengthened, retail sales gradually increased, causing medium-grade white Japonica rice prices to recover from weakness. Very little high-grade white Japonica rice was inquired about, and prices remained weak. Bo Dao rice continued to arrive, with normal retail sales and slightly lower prices. Yang Du Jian prices were fixed, and Bai Yuan prices fell slightly by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan.</p>
<p>Customer Rice Production Prices Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, guest rice (客秞) was difficult to prosper at the beginning, and sales became more active. In addition to continued brisk sales in this street, there were also small purchases from Beiyang and Ningbo. In the interior, Wuxi, Shantou, and Quanzhou were all greedy for imports. The total number of transactions reached around 15,000 bags. High and medium grades were stepped up by 0.01-0.02 to 0.03-0.05 yuan. Given the current active sales and rising prices in producing areas, even if there is an end to supplies, market prices will not easily fall. Yesterday, 7,824 bags of Jiangxi rice, 2,000 bags of Hansha unpolished rice, 4,550 bags of Hunan rice, and 100 bags of Yong Yuan rice were sold.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn Market Plunges Sharply - Uneven Distribution of Chips - Sparse Transactions but Large Fluctuations</p>
<p>After rising for two consecutive days, the yarn market suddenly reversed downward yesterday. This situation was due to the absence of major players and the strict crackdown on speculation. Registration procedures cannot be handled carelessly. According to market applications, there are five to six hundred applicants, but currently only forty or so have been approved after review. The uneven distribution of chips in the market makes transactions sparse, but the strength of fluctuations is significant. Furthermore, with a unanimous decline in the overseas American cotton, three-ply yarn market, market sentiment was affected, and the market plummeted along a straight line.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Plunges by Four to Five Yuan</p>
<p>In the previous market session, standard yarn opened with a sharp decline for all months. The drop was sharp, as American cotton and downstream Japanese Osaka three-ply yarn plummeted by more than four yuan. This caused a sudden setback in market sentiment. The current month fell sharply by four yuan, while the remaining months fell by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. The second session was triggered by heavy selling, and the current month rallied by two yuan. However, forward sales of spot yarn were heard to be less active than the previous day and appeared mediocre. By the close, the market re-entered a state of fatigue and fell again by over one yuan. As a result, standard yarn for all months fell sharply by 3.4 to 5.1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Da Feng sold 250 bales, He Xing 800 bales, Chang Ji 600 bales, Chang Yu 250 bales, Feng Tai 200 bales, Shen Ji 550 bales, Yuan Da 400 bales, Run Kang 700 bales, and Xie Cheng 600 bales. Qing Da bought 300 bales, Yuan Da 500 bales, Sen Kang 1,100 bales, Tai Chang 360 bales, Yi Chang 200 bales, Yong Da 450 bales, Jin Kang 500 bales, and Yi Ji 100 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the half-day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Sales Less Than the Previous Day</p>
<p>A total of 1,015 bales were purchased by various guilds throughout the day, with a price drop of 0.02 yuan. The purchase amount of each guild is as follows:</p>
<p>Term Cotton Collapses - US Cotton Market Conditions Are Miserable - Domestic Weather Also Appears Favorable</p>
<p>The cotton market has resumed its downward trend, with a sense of endless decline. The catastrophic collapse of the US cotton market is exceptionally frightening. Predictions for the future suggest that the 0.11 yuan level will be difficult to maintain. As a result, market sentiment has declined, coupled with favorable domestic weather and good prospects for the harvest a month ago, resulting in a situation of collapse.</p>
<p>All Months Fall by 0.9 to Over 1 Yuan</p>
<p>In the previous market session, standard cotton opened with a decline of over thirty points in US cotton. The situation was very weak. Dagu three-ply cotton fell sharply by 1.8 to 2.2 yuan. As a result, the market was shaken, and selling resumed. All months fell by 0.8 to 0.9 yuan. After the second session, the yarn market was heard to be unstable, and the decline continued. As a result, standard cotton for all months fell sharply by 0.9 to 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Da Fu sold 4,100 dan, Da Ji 900 dan, Zhen Da 700 dan, He Xing 2,800 dan, Xing Chang 800 dan, Ren Feng 1,500 dan, Run Kang 3,000 dan, Xie Cheng 800 dan, Xin Cheng 3,300 dan, and Xin Hua 700 dan. Tong Xing bought 800 dan, Yuan Da 2,300 dan, Shen Chang 3,200 dan, Shen Ji 900 dan, Yuan Yi 3,800 dan, Yong Da 900 dan, Yi Kang 800 dan, Xin Chang 1,300 dan, and Chang He 3,300 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the half-day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Factory Demand Also Appears Quiet</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption has also entered a standstill. Due to the sharp fall in US cotton, spot prices have broken through the 0.12 yuan level. Trends are difficult to stabilize, and three-ply term cotton has fallen by 2.2 yuan. In this sharp decline, manufacturers are naturally hesitant, and factory demand is quiet. The Yao cotton arriving at the dock amounted to 240 bales.</p>
<p>Sunny Weather, Many Bulls Painfully Cut Losses - US Cotton Plummets by Over Thirty Points</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with unfavorable news from Liverpool. The weather and cotton harvest conditions were favorable. Foreign merchants sold, and many bulls painfully cut their losses. All months fell by 7 to 11 points. After the recent sharp decline, sellers were hesitant, but buyers saw mediocre exports. Except for some industry players and Japanese merchants buying at limit prices, transactions were few, and there was caution. Hester estimated that factory consumption this week would be 157,000 bales, and Liverpool stocks would be 301,000 bales. Before the close, Roosevelt's statement that there was a possibility of 0.08 yuan per pound caused the public to sell, and market prices weakened again. Spot prices fell by 34 points, and futures fell by 31 to 36 points. British spot cotton fell by 8 points, and futures fell by 6 to 7 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to excessive rainfall, but returned due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and bulls taking profits. Pingguoer rose by 0.75 rupees, Aomu La fell by 1.25 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 0.5 to 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Three-Ply Yarn Strong, Cotton Weak - Qinghan Yarn Term and Spot Prices Fluctuating</p>
<p>▲Osaka, Osaka telegram on the 24th. Spot yarn prices rose and fell by 2 to 4 yuan. 16-count Sensu-men 237 yuan, up 2 yuan. 20-count Kingyo 258 yuan, up 4 yuan. 40-count Gosei 348 yuan, down 2 yuan. 42-count Kiji 365 yuan, down 2 yuan. Three-ply term yarn fell by 3.9 to 5.7 yuan, with the nearby month at 253.2 yuan and the distant month at 240 yuan. Term cotton fell by 1.8 to 2.2 yuan, with the nearby month at 70.8 yuan and the distant month at 72.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Public Bond Market Conditions Chaotic - Some Floating Multiples Emerge... Others Add to Arbitrage</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market conditions on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange were chaotic. Initially, it turned downward due to an excessive sharp rise the day before, followed by rising interest in arbitrage trading, which raised market sentiment. Transactions for the current month have only Monday of next week left, so both long and short positions were generally able to break even with the help of arbitrage trading, preventing any major squeezing. Yesterday, those who had floated gains emerged, and arbitrageurs proceeded, so transactions were still strong. Nos. 4, 32, 43, and 46, etc. all had arbitrage transactions, with Nos. 6 and 54 buying, and Nos. 7 and 43 selling. In the second session, most returned to 0.06 to 0.08 yuan, while Class A alone was strong at 0.55 to 0.06 yuan. No. 10 had a larger quantity of purchases, and the trend spiraled upward. Whether the environment will change is difficult to predict. For the time being, there should be no major waves. Market prices fell slightly by 0.01 to 1.56 yuan, etc. The total number of transactions totaled 27.55 million yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared and listed on the left. (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>
<p>US Stock Market Recovers After Rising</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 23rd), the New York stock market initially rose due to the failure of the comprehensive judicial reform plan, followed by profit-taking by long positions. The results were mixed, with 910,000 shares traded. According to broker opinions, there is no major risk of a decline at present.</p>
<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange - Pound Loose, US Tight - Red Shells Continue to Fall, Standard Gold Steps Down</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market opened yesterday with London closing up 0.0625 for the near term and 0.125 for the distant term. The New York silver market was unchanged. The pound against the dollar narrowed by 0.08 cents, the pound against the franc fell by 0.38 cents, the pound against the yen was unchanged, the dollar against the pound narrowed by 0.0175 yuan, the dollar against the franc rose by 0.125 yuan, and the dollar against the yen rose by 0.03 yuan. The opening selling price for the near term was 1 shilling, 2.25 pence and 2.28125 pence per dollar, and the US dollar was 29.53125 yuan. Compared with the previous close, the pound was loose and the US dollar was tight. East Asian exchanges were also slightly looser at 102 yuan. After opening, Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were sold at the current shilling rate and absorbed by banks. HSBC quotes for the pound and the US dollar were both flat, and the situation was calm. Later, banks traded among themselves, and the process spiraled. The afternoon closing selling price for the near term was 1 shilling, 2.25 pence and 2.28125 pence per dollar, and the US dollar was 29.53125 yuan. Compared with the previous close, the pound was loose and the US dollar was tight. The Japanese exchange rate was slightly looser at 102 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were sold at the shilling rate.</p>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC traded a large amount of current shipment Hong Kong position for 2.28125 shillings, which was favorably sold to Macgarry for a current rate of 2.28125 shillings, with a volume of about 50,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Hua Bi sold current shipments for 0.5625 to Da Tong, and Anda sold September contracts for 0.4375 to Da Tong, with a volume of about 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Tianjin guild sold current shipments for 102.25 yuan to Zhengjin Sumitomo, and Mitsui Joseon sold July contracts for 101.875 yuan to foreign firms, with a volume of about 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The gold market fell slightly yesterday, and red shells continued to fall to 1170 yuan. Initially, the London spot gold price rose by 3.5 pence. The central bank's quotes were announced, and the British and American markets were flat. The customs gold unit rose by 0.04%, and the standard gold price rose to 1137.1 yuan. The morning opening was still 1142.5 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong continued to supply, and although Yi Yu bought, the afternoon closing still fell to 1142.3 yuan, falling 0.2 yuan compared to the previous closing and rising over 5 yuan compared to the closing price. Red shells stood at 1170 yuan, sold by Da Feng Heng to the Hankou guild for 100 taels, Sheng Yuan Yong for 50 taels, and Qing Fa Yong for 40 taels. Yesterday, Da Chang Xiang discounted Sheng Yuan Yuan for 3 yuan. There were 588 August contracts remaining, with 6 long positions and 5 short positions. There were 833 September contracts, with a total of 14 long positions and 9 short positions. There were 77 transactions in half a day.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Export Silk Prices Gradually Converging</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was mediocre abroad, while Shanghai gradually became more active. Orders from Europe and America and spot transactions were converging substantially. For example, Lienart bought 10 dan of 83.13 - 15-count white silk at 930 yuan, a firm and reliable deal. In other cases, a 16.18 grade Golden Double Eagle brand had a foreign limit price of 860 yuan, which was over 30 yuan away from the Shanghai market price. Ordinary B-brand foreign firms returned a price of 790 yuan, which Chinese merchants were willing to sell, but lately, silk production has coincided with the hot summer. Silk factories have felt insufficient water, so the export weight is often deficient. Therefore, silk merchants are quite hesitant and make few transactions. If French and American silk prices can continue to strengthen and receive higher sales offers that can offset the light weight loss, then foreign trade should be easier to close deals on. Yesterday, domestic silk sentiment recovered, and market prices rose slightly accordingly. There were 30 dan of opening orders and 10 dan of transactions by foreign firms.</p>
<p>Qimen Floral Scent Sells Quickly Upon Arrival</p>
<p>Qimen floral-scented black tea has been very popular since new goods arrived in Shanghai. Because the Russian Zhuang route is not weak and the British Zhuang have a large demand, it sells quickly upon arrival. Yesterday, 50 new patterns were displayed, and Jardine Matheson exclusively purchased 40 patterns, totaling over 2,000 boxes, with a fixed price of 33-34 yuan. As for other black teas, the General Distribution Office is currently planning the entire sales process. The Pingshui tea market had the China Tea Company handle 959 boxes of Du Zhan Kui Da Bang yesterday, pulling the price to 40.05 yuan. The movement of Mei tea remains active. Yuanzhu is sluggish, and the high-quality Zhen Mei tea from Luzhuang shows no signs of improvement. Stocks of Xiu Mei tea are already scarce, with steady sales and prices. Low-grade goods are more active, it is said.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods</h3>
<p>Lily Flower Market Continues to Loosen</p>
<p>The price of new lily flower goods had an initial period of competition with high raises and low presses due to the uneven distribution of peers, but this has since returned to harmony. Recently, the sources from various producing areas have been prosperous, and the number of arrivals has flooded the market, resulting in supply exceeding demand. Selling prices have also gradually loosened. Currently, Da Xing tea is being offered at 107 yuan, with a market price of 23 yuan, and slightly inferior tea is at 22 yuan. Looking at the market situation in the future, if sales are low, there is still a risk of continued decline. However, top-grade high-quality Zhuang tea has not yet been seen.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Autumn Velvet Flannel Off-Market Sales Active</p>
<p>Recently, with the hot weather, the velvet flannel industry has been busy drying out mold, so transactions have been unusually slow. Both retail and wholesale transactions have decreased. Most businesses must pack and put away summer goods before starting autumn business. Therefore, summer goods sales are all seeing price decreases. Although autumn goods have not yet officially opened, momentum is extremely high. Yesterday, Dong Huo power is ordinary at 3.4 yuan, white beiji at 3.85 yuan, and 55 zhi gong at 5.5 yuan. Xi Huo 1111 white beiji at 5.2 yuan, Bai Sui Fang at 6.1 yuan, Hao Hua white zhi gong at 9 yuan, and Chang Tai stripes pang pi at 5.25 yuan. Guo Huo Da Guang Ming plain beiji at 2.95 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>White Lead Skin Sales Active, Prices Rise</p>
<p>White lead skin sales have been strong due to the passing of the mold season and the battery factories starting work. Demand has suddenly increased. Recently, military factories and military needs have been frequent, so sales have become more active. Buying and selling in the market is becoming more lively, and sales offers have also advanced suddenly. Yesterday, fine pattern Nos. 2 and 3 sold for 168 yuan, No. 4 sold for 165 yuan, No. 5 and 6 sold for 158 yuan, No. 7 sold for 152 yuan, and Nos. 8 and 9 sold for 150 yuan. Other thick patterns also sold for 160 to 165 yuan.</p>

<p>Children's Special</p>
<h3>Anti-Heat Movement</h3>
<p>— Mu Jie</p>
<p>Children! If you have paid attention to past current events, you may remember that Chen Yi, the chairman of Fujian Province last year, promoted a kind of anti-heat movement? He ordered the provincial government office staff to continue working as usual even in the sweltering heat. At that time, everyone thought that the anti-heat movement fully demonstrated the spirit of working, and they praised and responded to it.</p>
<p>What kind of content is the anti-heat movement I am talking about now?</p>
<p>The anti-heat movement I am talking about now is different from the path promoted by Director Chen. Roughly divided, it can be explained from two aspects:</p>
<p>On the one hand, pay attention to hygiene in summer and strive to prevent infectious diseases: because summer is the season when germs are most prosperous, and all kinds of diseases that endanger human lives are very prevalent. Flies and mosquitoes are introducing diseases to people anytime and anywhere. If you are slightly careless in your diet, daily life, and actions, dangerous diseases will come immediately. You are not very old yet, and you may not know how to pay attention to hygiene and prevent diseases. Then you must always ask your teachers and follow the teachers' careful instructions. Moreover, you must pay attention to hygiene in everything. Eat less food that is harmful to your stomach, change dirty clothes that are harmful to your health often, and always pay attention to your food, clothing, housing, and transportation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, do not relax the work you should do just because the weather is hot: because the hot summer weather makes people feel dizzy and sitting still may cause you to sweat profusely, let alone working as usual? Of course, it is extra difficult. I know that you often have this mentality: 'The weather is so hot, working is really uncomfortable, why not just enjoy the cool breeze and play for a while!' Oh no! This kind of mentality may feel comfortable for a while, but when you feel annoyed because you have not finished your work, children! I ask you, do you still feel comfortable? Therefore, no matter how hot the weather is, you should still do your work. You must not relax the work you should do just because the weather is hot.</p>
<p>During the long summer vacation, you must have many things you want to do. Let me tell you! Nothing is more important than the anti-heat movement. Do you want to spend the hot summer safely? Then you must start implementing the anti-heat movement from today.</p>
<p>Come! Children, work hard to promote the anti-heat movement!</p>
<h3>Ying'er's Diary</h3>
<p>— Wang Yi</p>
<p>Drafting Summer Vacation Work</p>
<p>The alarm clock on the bedside table kept ringing incessantly, waking me up from my sleep. I rubbed my sleepy eyes and hung up the mosquito net. I only saw two or three squares of sunlight shining diagonally on the floor through the room. I looked at the clock again, and it clearly told me—it was seven o'clock.</p>
<p>As soon as I finished washing, Qin and Cheng arrived at my house one after another; it turned out that we had made an appointment yesterday after school broke for summer vacation to gather at my house today to discuss how to draft our summer vacation work? My father knew about this and was very happy. He earnestly said to us: ‘No matter how you plan your work, you should always pay attention to the spirit of sacrificing yourself for others, and your words and deeds should be consistent so that you do not waste your summer vacation.’</p>
<p>After a thorough discussion, we reached a conclusion agreed upon by everyone: the morning is our time for self-study; the afternoon is our time for service. Most people have their daily work in the morning, and we are also unwilling to sacrifice the precious time in the morning, so we set the morning time as our own time to read newspapers and books, do summer homework, and other work. In the afternoon, because most people take a nap and avoid the heat under the bean trellis and melon rack after finishing their work in the morning, we are willing to use this time to do our work of serving the community. In this work, we divide it into three aspects to implement: first, diligent study; second, explaining current affairs news; and third, practicing singing patriotic songs.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we went to the district office together to ‘meet with the district chief, and convey this meaning to him, asking him to help us from the side. He agreed very much and encouraged us. After returning home, I wrote a letter to the teacher, asking him to criticize and teach us more about our summer vacation community service work.</p>
<h3>Introducing a Few Child Stars</h3>
<p>— Zhen Sheng</p>
<p>㊂ Mou Ling</p>
<p>At the Shanghai Municipal Government's 10th Anniversary celebration, the Oriental Hollywood Night unfolded at the city stadium. Many brilliant stars shone brightly, illuminating the earth with starlight. Mou Ling, a naive little child star, also appeared to participate in the grand event, performing a tap dance, leaving a deep impression on many viewers!</p>
<p>The name Mou Ling is probably not as well known as Juan Juan and Rong Rong. The reason is that she is a new child star in the film industry! She is also the youngest, only seven years old this year. She is from Chongqing, Sichuan, the same town as Juan Juan. Her father, Mou Hongyi, graduated from South Manchuria Medical College, and her mother, Chen Baojian, is a top student at Tongde Obstetrics Hospital. They are both doctors who save people and treat the world. They only have her as a daughter. She is the apple of their eye. She has no brothers or sisters, so they like and care for her especially. Xu Suling, the director of Yihua Company, is a good friend of her father and often goes to her house to play. Seeing such a naive and lively little girl, and because the Yihua authorities were thinking of finding and creating a little child star, they asked Mou Ling's parents for their consent. Mou Ling herself was also very happy to hear this. After discussing some of the procedures that needed to be handled, both parties signed a five-year contract. It has been seven or eight months since then. She is currently studying in Class B of the first grade at Weida Primary School on Chen Lingde Road. Every morning, her mother takes her in her own car, first to Gujiazhai Park for a walk, doing some stretching exercises and fitness exercises, breathing fresh air. After lunch, the car picks her up again. When school is over in the evening, her mother personally picks her up again. When she comes back, she goes through Gujiazhai Park and runs in to rest and walk for an hour or two before going home. Besides studying, she also studies under tap dance expert Ji Fengchun, just like Juan Juan. Because she is very smart, she has already gained some insight in less than a month. After a month, she has truly become proficient. During the summer vacation, she studies very diligently. She told me that she likes to study arithmetic the most. “＋12＝15”, “45－20＝25” are often silently recited in her small mouth. Sometimes she gets confused about multiplication and division. If she doesn't get the answer, she would rather not rest for two hours, working tirelessly! Maybe she will be a mathematician in the future.</p>
<h3>The Airman and the Glider (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Dong Xun</p>
<p>The structure of a glider is similar to that of a small airplane, except that it lacks an engine. Therefore, it needs the assistance of another power source to take off. The best place for a test flight is a large plain surrounded by gently sloping mountains or a seashore, with forests nearby being the least suitable.</p>
<p>Gliders are further divided into two types: gliders for preliminary gliding practice and gliders for long-duration flights in rising air currents. During flight, either human power or steam engine power (see Figures 5, 6, and 7) is used to tow them up from flat ground or plateaus. After reaching a certain altitude, the towrope is released, allowing them to fly freely in the sky at a speed of up to 1.5 meters per second (see Figure 8).</p>
<p>Currently, the world's largest glider is the "Austria I," designed by Dr. Kober of Austria, with a wingspan of 30 meters (see Figure 9).</p>
<p>Recently, China's aviation school plans to build a glider for a demonstration at the next National Games, and the Eurasia Aviation Corporation also plans to manufacture several to promote the sport.</p>
<p>Gliders can also be arranged in a train and towed in the air by airplanes or airships. The United States and Germany have experimented with this, and the results have been excellent. The Soviet Union once used an airplane to tow three gliders for 3,550 kilometers in 39 hours, truly making it an 'aerial train'!</p>
<h3>Loyalty (6)</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>They were now determined to elect a commander-in-chief to oversee all military affairs. Marquis de Lescure nominated Cassarino, the peddler, because he was the first to raise an army. This was truly a strange thing; so many nobles, gentlemen, and other experienced military officers who had received military education were willing to obey the command of this uneducated peddler, without any selfish or jealous thoughts. Cassarino also showed no signs of pride, remaining as humble as ever. However, his every action and every word demonstrated his intelligence and competence, truly deserving the title of 'Saint of Anjou' given to him by the peasants. At this time, their hopes reached their peak; their numbers had increased considerably, and all their weapons were much better. They had even discussed how to march on Paris, welcome the young master back, and crown him in the capital town of La Fontenay, reorganizing their government.</p>
<p>Cassarino led his troops and turned towards the area of Nantes, leaving Henry and a group of peasants to defend Saumur. However, he could not prevent them from returning to their hometowns, because they were homesick, there was nothing to do at the moment, and they did not understand the importance of defense, so they slipped away to their homes one by one. In the end, only Henry and a few officers were left. Every night, they would go to the places that should be guarded and shout, 'Long live the King!' to show that they were prepared. Unfortunately, the number of people decreased more and more, until only eight people were left. Henry could not maintain the defense, so he had to leave Saumur and contact the comrades in the Anjou area. At that time, they luckily rescued a group of priests who had been imprisoned by the enemy and were about to be executed. The priests were happy and grateful, thanking the peasants who had rescued them. The peasants hurriedly said, 'Don't thank us, we were fighting for you in the first place. If we couldn't save you, we wouldn't dare to return to our homes. Now you are free, which shows that God is still helping us.'</p>
<p>However, the situation changed again. The Paris government sent a strong force to the Bocage region, brutally burning and killing. Clisson was burned to the ground, even the gunpowder factory was destroyed. Marquis de Lescure had anticipated that his hometown would inevitably suffer, but in order to reassure the people, he did not move anything from his mansion. His family had long been united with the army, and only by following the army could the weak and helpless be safe. Cassarino's attack on Nantes also unfortunately failed, and he himself was seriously injured. He died a few days later, but he was very willing to die for his loyalty to the country.</p>
<h3>Resistance</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>On a Sunday, Min'er and his brother Cong'er were playing ball on the small lawn at home. While they were having a great time, Min'er accidentally kicked the ball far away with great force, but after a while, it gradually stopped. He unconsciously thought of this question: how did it stop? So he opened his mouth and asked his brother.</p>
<p>His brother said, 'The ball rolls on the ground and stops after a while, so we can guess that there must be a force between the ground and the surface of the ball that can make the ball gradually stop. Although we cannot see this force, it must exist. Otherwise, why would the ball stop on its own? We call this force resistance. Resistance is the opposite of a driving force, and it often reduces the effectiveness of the driving force. For example, if we walk too much, our feet will feel sore, which is also due to resistance, isn't it reducing the effectiveness of the work? So we consider this resistance to be the most annoying thing, so we often try to eliminate it. For example, isn't it necessary to add oil to the axles of machines from time to time? This is all to reduce its impact.'</p>
<p>'Then, if we don't need this resistance, wouldn't it be better to make the machine produce more things?'</p>
<p>'No, it also has its uses, and we use this resistance in many places. If there were no resistance in the world, it wouldn't work, and nothing could move on the road. The reason why we can walk is thanks to resistance, otherwise we can only use our feet to resist the ground and move our feet. Why is the ice surface so slippery? This is because the resistance on the ice surface is small, so we cannot go on the ice. Similarly, if there were no resistance, a ladder could not lean against the wall for us to go up and down the stairs. Let me give you another example: if a rickshaw is pulled and produces a driving force, this driving force is forward, but resistance occurs between the wheels and the ground. Because resistance is backward, the two forces are in opposite directions, so they become a relative force that makes the wheels turn forward. If there were no resistance, the wheels would only turn in place and would not move forward. So resistance is essential to us, we need it very much, but at the same time we hate it. Something is both beneficial and harmful, so we only look at whether it helps us or harms us, and if it is harmful, we should always try our best to reduce it.'</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>On Reading Zhang Zizhong's Talk</h3>
<p>— Shi Yi</p>
<p>Having said "Zhang will never do anything to betray the people," yet being the most active in running around for the so-called "peace negotiations," Zhang Zizhong recently published a talk, in which he said: "One should know that China is a whole country, and the Chinese nation is a whole nation. If it is a matter of the entire country, it should be handled by the central government. If it is only a local matter, one should obey the orders of the Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council..."</p>
<p>Then, is the Lugouqiao Incident a "whole incident" or a "local incident"?</p>
<p>"China is a whole country, and the Chinese nation is a whole nation." The movement of a single hair affects the whole body. Since Hebei-Chahar is Chinese territory, the events that occur within Hebei-Chahar are naturally national events.</p>
<p>Regarding the Lugouqiao Incident as a planned conspiracy by the enemy, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had already said it at the Lushan talks. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also said: "Our Northeast Provinces have been lost for six years. Following the Tanggu Truce, the conflict point has now reached Lugouqiao at the gate of Beiping. If Lugouqiao can be coerced and forcibly occupied, then Beiping, our five-hundred-year-old ancient capital, the center of northern political culture, and a military stronghold, will become Shenyang the second. If today's Beiping becomes yesterday's Shenyang, today's Hebei-Chahar will also become yesterday's Northeast Provinces. If Beiping can become Shenyang, why can't Nanjing become Beiping?" From this, we can see that no matter from which point of view, the Lugouqiao Incident is definitely not a "local incident."</p>
<p>But what is strange is that without the approval of the central government, the 37th Division, which was resisting the enemy, was driven back to a defensive area outside "the Beiping area."</p>
<p>Taking ten thousand steps back, the Lugouqiao Incident can be resolved by the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. But is the Hebei-Chahar Political Council an administrative organ belonging to the central government? Is it "obeying orders" for an administrative organ belonging to the central government not to adhere to the four minimum requirements indicated by the central government?</p>
<p>If it is said that it is not, then how can one explain "China is a whole country, and the Chinese nation is a whole nation!"</p>
<p>Director Li of the 29th Army's Shanghai Office said at a Shandong fellow villagers association reception: "I hope that the public opinion circle will do more encouraging articles and less stimulating arguments, so as not to fall into the enemy's trap." I think that this statement is correct in principle, and it is not limited to the 29th Army. But if unfortunately some people have already "fallen into the enemy's trap," then even if they want to write "encouraging articles," they will have no way to start.</p>
<h3>The Mentality of "Civilization"</h3>
<p>— Yin Ti</p>
<p>When I was a child, I often read stories and phrases such as "judging the heart of a gentleman by the mind of a petty person" in novels. Looking up and observing the relationships between people, this kind of phenomenon does exist. But at that time, I always thought that this was a special product of China, or at least it was only among "barbaric" nations that this kind of mentality would arise.</p>
<p>But later, reading international news every day, I suddenly discovered that this kind of mentality is not only a unique "advantage" of "barbaric" nations, but the more "civilized" a country is, the more obvious this kind of mentality becomes. Even in "benevolent" countries, apart from expressing this kind of mentality more strongly and obviously, there are no more brilliant ideas. At this point, I fully understood that the mentality of "judging the heart of a gentleman by the mind of a petty person" is quite "civilized," and not at all barbaric or contradictory.</p>
<p>These past few days, the Sino-Japanese relationship has become increasingly tense.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Following this, I read a piece of news in the newspaper:</p>
<p>"Nanjing, 22nd dispatch from this newspaper" According to sources in relevant circles: Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the staff and expatriates of our embassy have been under close surveillance. There are many plainclothes detectives and policemen stationed near the embassy. When staff members go out, plainclothes detectives closely follow behind them, obliterating the dignity and privileges of diplomats. This is truly an evil precedent that has never existed in any country in the world. Chen Bosheng, the special correspondent stationed in Tokyo by the Central News Agency, has also been under close surveillance by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department since the incident occurred. In addition to being followed by detectives in every move, he has also been given a car. No matter where he goes, he must ride in that car, and the driver must report Chen's actions to the authorities every day...</p>
<p>Japan could originally be called a "espionage state." Not only does it have a dense network of detectives everywhere in the country, but it also has a considerable number of detectives operating abroad. Those operating in China under the cover of "×××" and "××××" stickers are even too numerous to count.</p>
<p>Effortlessly seizing the Northeast Provinces, propping up the puppet Puyi, establishing the rebellious Yin Rugeng's false autonomy, alienating Inner Mongolia... etc., these are all the proud masterpieces of these bigwigs. Kawashima Yoshiko, Doihara, and Major General Matsumuro are all "stars" in their history of aggression.</p>
<p>Having become accustomed to doing this kind of thing themselves, they cannot help but suspect that others are also operating on their own territory. This is "human nature." This is the concrete manifestation of the so-called mentality of "judging the heart of a gentleman by the mind of a petty person."</p>
<p>In old Chinese novels, there are often stories of "police officers who were originally thieves." Originally, "police officers" are specifically for catching thieves, and only thieves themselves are most familiar with the behavior of thieves. Therefore, using thieves to be "police officers" is truly appropriate. But there may be problems, and they are big ones. Because they themselves have done this kind of thing, they are naturally particularly careful about this kind of thing. Therefore, even an extremely ordinary little thing will often cause their suspicion, and even "stir up waves without wind," so that in the end, people will laugh crookedly, and they themselves will end up neither crying nor laughing.</p>
<h3>Pitiful Worm</h3>
<p>— Guan Yinxi</p>
<p>In that exquisite, somewhat Oriental-style wine tavern, I often met him, a thin, honest fisherman. Wearing tattered clothes and a sorrowful, unkempt face. With his attire and his face, he didn't seem like someone who often came to wine taverns, but in fact, I often ran into him. As soon as he stepped in the door, everything else ceased to exist. He would hang his head dejectedly and go straight to the unnoticed table in the darkest corner to sit and worry, his eyes dull and staring blankly at the ground.</p>
<p>He never participated in anyone's conversations, drinking a little wine, or eating some snacks. When the wine tavern opened, he was the first customer to come in, and when it closed, he was the last customer to leave. In this fishing village, he was considered half a person, because in people's eyes, his whole body was numb, dead, with only a vague consciousness.</p>
<p>Stories about him were circulated by people in the form of anecdotes. A friend told me:</p>
<p>"Don't look at him as a fool, he used to have a good life. But a woman ruined him. He fell too hard three years ago and still can't get up."</p>
<p>These words aroused my strong interest, and I decided to pay him a visit. Therefore, on a quiet, midsummer night, I walked along the beach towards the fisherman's shack where he lived. The house was built of oyster shells mixed with mud, small, damp, and chaotic. Moonlight shone in from the window, illuminating some rotten furniture, revealing infinite melancholy and desolation. I stood there and groped for about a minute, but saw nothing.</p>
<p>"He hasn't come back yet," I thought, and started to walk back along the same route.</p>
<p>The beach was bare, the moonlight shone dazzlingly in the air, and a faint light shot out from the sand grains. Everything was quiet around, the tide had receded, and the sea was resting. I was very eager to walk on the beach. After no more than five minutes, a black spot caught my eye. I walked along a row of footprints to look at him, and it was indeed that "half a person." He was sitting there indifferently and sadly, staring foolishly at the sea, like a dead man. When I approached, he didn't even move.</p>
<p>"I came to see you especially, friend!" I said, starting with the words I had planned.</p>
<p>He still didn't move, as if he hadn't heard.</p>
<p>"Because people are spreading stories about your life that I find deeply interesting."</p>
<p>He shrugged slightly, raised his eyes, and looked at me sadly, his gaunt face full of sadness and timidity, as if saying, "Is that so?"</p>
<p>"So I wanted to talk to you," I concluded finally.</p>
<p>His eyes left me, lowered, and fell onto his chest.</p>
<p>"Are you willing to tell me? I want to hear about your past." I sat down beside him.</p>
<p>"Past?" he repeated to himself in a low voice for the first time, his voice very hoarse and weak. "Are you the gentleman from the city?" He suddenly became excited and stared fiercely at me in a histrionic manner. "Is that so? I saw you in the tavern."</p>
<p>I agreed that it was exactly what he had guessed.</p>
<p>"Then you've seen a lot of people?" he asked carefully.</p>
<p>"Of course! There are all kinds of people in the city..." I replied with a smile.</p>
<p>"Have you seen a woman? A short but sturdy woman."</p>
<p>"There are plenty of such women there, as many as you want to see."</p>
<p>"Is that really so? My wife is just such a person!" he sighed, changing to another tone and saying sadly, "Three years ago, when I went out to sea, she was abducted by a Japanese from the fishing cooperative using a boat. I still haven't found her yet. But she's a good woman, she wouldn't leave me, she'll come back. Therefore, I often go to the tavern to wait. Last year, I met a man there who told me that he saw her in a brothel in Taiwan. She told him that she was about to return and told me to wait in the tavern."</p>
<p>"Do you believe this is true?"</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't it be true? She wouldn't lie to me," he said, firmly revealing a smile.</p>
<p>As I walked away, he still saw me off for a while behind me, whispering:</p>
<p>"If you, sir, go back to the city and meet her, please take a message to her for me..."</p>
<p>I replied, waved my hand, and walked away. All the way home, I was still constantly disturbed by the pitiful fate of this pitiful worm.</p>
