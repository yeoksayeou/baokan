<h2>Page 1</h2>
<h3>敵連遭敗衂三次增援我陣綫鞏固待機痛擊</h3>
<p>沿江敵陣地被我切斷包圍　敵空陸慘敗死亡數額極鉅　昨敵機肆虐被我擊落兩架</p>
<p>敵軍二度在滬登陸以來、為時又將一週、始終侷促一隅、未能有所發展、連日向我進犯、均經痛擊、土卒傷亡極重、銳氣消沉、且虹口楊樹浦區吳淞區羅店區等三處部隊、被我重兵切斷、不但迄未完成打通之夢、且羅店區殘敵被我包圍、狼狽不堪、敵軍主將松井於敗之餘、不得不再向東京乞援、其增援部隊約兩師團及軍火、已於昨日上午由運輸艦四十九艘載抵吳淞口外、正相機登陸、松并並會向外宣傳、將於下星期初向我全綫總攻、聞我前綫軍事當局、對敵軍增援一節、認為係敗挫後必有之舉動、至於定期總攻一節、則認為係一種虛聲恫嚇之技倆、蓋松井抵滬後、已屢次頒佈總攻之令、上月廿六·廿七兩日間、並會向各國駐滬軍事當局宣稱、謂月底必可將滬戰完全結束、恢復原狀、但目前之事實、已充分證明虛聲恫嚇之無補實際、總之、我軍抱定不驕不餒之精神、採取穩紮穩打之步驟、敵軍縱源源而來、誓當嚴陣以待、予以重大之打擊、戰事前途、當有把握云、</p>
<p>今晨一時許、我閘北□□砲兵陣地、開炮十餘發、向虹口方面敵軍陣地轟擊、敵軍沈寂、未敢還擊、我方旋卽停止、移時有敵機一架、飛翔於浦東上空偵察、多時而去、</p>
<h3>羅店我逼近係家橋</h3>
<p>確息、我軍在羅店一帶、乘勝前進、逼近孫家橋、並佔領南長橋坍石橋、輿羅店東南角之我軍、聯成一綫、</p>
<p>羅店戰事連日來異常劇烈、被困之敵、雖屢圍衝出、皆被我軍擊退、我軍從三方面同時猛攻、進展殊速、敵軍陣地、更形縮小、被圍之敵、約計尚有一旅團之眾、蓋連日作戰、已傷亡大半、昨晚我軍向小川沙口淮攻之一路　頗為得手、敵之歸路、殆完全截斷、羅店鎮三分之二、全為我軍控制、敵在此浹小面積中、實已無迥旋餘地、昨晨敵會有若干次猛烈之衝出、發生極激烈之爭鬥、敵在我軍衝鋒肉搏之下、狼狽遣退、</p>
<p>中央社、羅店方面之敵、自我軍前晨突出奇兵、山小川沙西北隅抄襲敵軍後路之後、已完成四面包圍之形勢、前晚敵軍數度向我反攻、余圍突圍而出、迭經我軍以機關槍密集掃射、敵軍傷亡重大、不支而退、直至昨晨為止、敵軍仍在我重重包圍之中、突圍而出之企圖、迄未得逞、</p>
<h3>敵旅團長倉永斃命</h3>
<p>中央社云、上月廿九日在羅店劇戰時、我軍曾擊斃敵旅圍長一名惟姓名尚未查出、茲據上月三十日東京日日新開號外載稱、在羅店作戰之敵軍、共為三旅團、旅團長為倉永·鷹森·竹田三人、當日斃命者為倉永、係被我砲兵擊中而死、該報號外、并將倉永之照片刊出云、</p>
<h3>吳淞殘敵潰退江濱</h3>
<p>吳淞之敵、被我大軍進迫後、已向江濱潰退、結集江濱一帶、前晚浦江敵艦在吳淞附近、發砲向我陣地　擊、掩護其步隊進退、我軍後方砲隊、當卽予以還擊、雙方交轟、直至昨晨、砲聲方息、我軍陣地、雖在敵軍密集砲火之下、仍追踪敵跡、向前衝殺、積極進展、敵軍企圖進攻實山月浦之計劃、已告完全失敗、又軍息、吴淞鎭方面敵軍、前晚會分兵一路、向月浦鎭東南隅我路陣地偷襲、經我軍迎擊、激戰甚烈、至昨晨拂曉、敵不支潰退、我軍乘勝追擊，斃敵甚多、並將陣地向前進展兩英里、敵未敢再犯、實山方面亦沉寂無事、（又訊）昨日上午我軍又拔隊進攻、在泰興路同濟路等處與敵軍接觸、遂發生劇烈之巷戰、雙方肉搏至午刻、我軍士卒喊殺連天·血戰結果、西綫殘敵、整退至蕰藻浜北、中路陣綫我軍沿鐵路繼續挺進、砲台灣已無敵蹤、昨據前綫某軍官談、盤踞吳淞之敵、决予尅日肅淸、吳淞西綫殘敵擊退後、我軍已進駐製糖廠、</p>
<h3>敵軍進攻北站敗退</h3>
<p>虹口一帶、敵軍自日前撤退陸戰隊、由正規增援陸軍調防後、前晚又有由吳淞開來敵陸軍部、於昨日上午三時三十分許、向我北站方面進攻、希圖突出重圍、再謀一逞、我軍當以迫擊砲還擊、一時砲火甚烈、敵不支退去、</p>
<p>今晨零點二十分、敵火向我閘北方面進犯、我軍除以機槍密集掃射外、同時我口口方面之砲兵陣地、并以重砲及迫擊砲向虹口及楊樹浦一帶敵軍陣地為擊、歷時甚久、敵軍受捐頗鉅、進犯之敵、卽行狠狽而退、</p>
<h3>敵大批援軍已到滬</h3>
<p>據確息、前晚有敵運輸艦四十九艘、（大部為商輪所改造）載運大批援軍及械彈、駛抵吳淞口外五十海里洋面、迄昨日上午尚泊該處、似有大舉犯我模樣、</p>
<p>前晚續有敵商輪二艘、駛入浦江、一名Gonkonmaru停靠招商局北棧、輪上載有大批草包、據識者云、此項草包、乃潗包裹敵軍死屍所用者、一名Caicutta　Maru　停靠公和祥碼頭、裝來軍需品甚多、另又有敵輸Kiurgasa　Maru一艘、於昨晨黎明　前駛靠招商局中棧、當卽有大批軍械卸下、以上三輪、復先援換載敵軍傷兵及死屍、於昨日上午十一時一刻下午三時、及五時二十五分、分別相繼駛返日本、</p>
<h3>敵空軍人員大喪亡</h3>

<h3>虹口浦束昨晨大火</h3>
<p>工部局報告、昨晨七時許、麥倫中學後面起大火、浦東方面之大火、經廷燒一夜、至昨晨方熄、八時海勝路及歐嘉路一帶均起火、八時至九時間較為平靖、週家嘴路與麥倫中學之間有五六處起火、靶子路與赫司克而路附近亦有一處起火、火勢頗烈、又九時至十時間下列四處起火、㊀愛而近路與北江西路、㊁北四川路海寗路、（上列兩處、已有租界救火會人員奔往灌救）、㊂麥根路車站房屋（因轟炸所致）、㊃浦東安利貨棧附近、</p>
<h3>敵禁外人赴楊樹浦</h3>
<p>神州社云、自滬戰外擴後、日軍已准外人自由出人楊樹浦區、詎自昨日下午起、日軍又出通告、警告外人、不準擅入楊樹浦區域、於是欲向該區搬遷什物之外人、複被逐回、聞外籍記者執有通行證者、仍可出可出入虹口區域、但如發生危險、日軍亦不負責云、</p>
<h3>兩日間沿江沿海敵死傷達八千餘</h3>
<p>吳淞一役死亡最多　大批屍首投人海中</p>
<p>中央社云、日來敵擬在羅店吳淞等處、企圖完成某聯絡陣綫、迭向我陣地猛烈襲擊、我軍沉着應戰、敵終不得逞、據可靠方面所得消息、敵自本月一日晚、開始向我進攻以來、二日間各路傷亡極重、計陣亡者五千餘人受傷者三千餘人、其中尤以吳淞一役、死亡最多、達三千餘人、其次為羅店張華浜等地、現大批屍首、已於三日晨五時許、在張華浜附近裝入運輸艦一艘、駛出口外、聞該批屍體卽在三夾水外投入海中、並不裝回國內云、</p>
<h3>敵機肄虐到處投彈昨被我擊落兩架</h3>
<p>流彈橫飛非戰區均遭波及　護送難民輸亦被機槍掃射</p>
<p>昨日敵機自黎明以迄薄暮、成羣結隊、在閘北滬西等處轟炸掃射、中午有敵機一架、在閘北麥根路一帶、飛翔甚低、未幾、於投彈一枚急駛上升後、正欲繼續投彈、忽然尾部冒火、煙霧四圍、機件受損、驟然下墮、宛如火龍、山空中直落墮地、機內所置之炸彈、立時爆炸、轟然一聲震全市、特區市民、目暏敵機下墮者甚多、當時疑係敵機自行爆炸、直至昨晚得到前方報告、始悉係被我軍所擊落、緣昨日午後零時一刻、敵機三架、在中山路附近、向下飛投彈、被我軍某師某團團長吳求劍、派團附張止戈、連長洪策、指揮防空大隊、乘其不意、以高射炮小砲高射機關檐襲擊、一時彈如雪飛、遂將敵機一架油槽擊毀、爆發生火、機身全燒、黑姻如雲、落於廣肇路廣肇山莊墳地、當被該團士兵在防空陣地、拾得敵機之機師頭顱機槍破片等、上有「名古屋造」等字樣、被焚之機翅上亦有「昭和十一年十二月」字樣、聞該師派專員將該機身運往南京、此外尚有敵機一架、於昨日下午二時、在北站帶投彈、飛行甚低、又經我軍瞄準發砲擊落、機身落地焚燬、機師當塲殞命云、</p>

<p>（甲）全部摧毀法</p>
<p>（證明）將電網根本摧壞或毀滅、（方法）㊀用坦克車向電網衝過去、將電網壓毀、此係最可靠方法、㊁用手榴彈或迫擊砲、對凖電網架子的底盤轟炸、只要把電綱架子炸毀、綱絲着地、電網卽失其效力、</p>
<p>（乙）斷絕電流法</p>
<p>（說明）電網最怕網絲着地、倘能用任何方法、使其一二根網絲落地、則該段電網的電流、卽人地消失、</p>
<p>（方法）㊀用長柄斧頭、或不傳電的物件、如乾燥的木棍木板竹棍等、向電網重擊、將其摧毀、（槍械鐵器等傳電物切不可用）務使電網上的網絲、斷落碰地、㊁拿銅絲鐵絲或鍊條兩頭繫以鐵球、或別種鐵器各一個、從遠處拋在電網上、務使銅絲鐵絲或鍊條的一部份、掛在電網上、一部碰着地上、如此可使電網上的電流、通地而消失、</p>
<p>（丙）避免觸電法</p>
<p>（說明）用不傳電的東西、鋪在電網上面、使越過電網時、身體不致觸電、</p>
<p>（方法）用乾燥的被毯等不傳電的物件、堆在電網上、再在上面鋪以乾的木板、卽可跨越而過、留心弗觸網絲、</p>
<p>注意</p>
<p>㊀遇着鐵絲網等、若不知其有電、則可用（乙）第㊁條方法試驗之、倘是電網、則銅絲鐵絲鍊條等物、拋上去的時候、電網的網絲上、必定有火花發生、㊁電網上如已有人觸電、後面的人切不可再用手脚或槍械等與之接觸、須先用上述方法攻破電網、以免觸電、</p>

<h3>敵機十五架轟炸滬西無辜市民死傷數百人</h3>
<p>全線澈宵砲戰異常劇烈　我空軍出動黑夜襲敵機　吳淞方面敵軍大批登陸</p>
<p>登陸增援敵軍、連日經我軍包圍迎頭痛擊、傷亡奇重、銳氣全消、一方面急電乞援、同時盡量利用重砲飛機日夜騷擾我陣地、間以小隊衝擊、迨我軍躍出戰壕追逐、則又迅速遁去、大部敵軍深壘不出、憑藉其堅固之防禦工事、負嵎待援、昨晚江灣至吳淞一綫、劇烈砲戰、澈宵未停、大批敵機亦四出活躍、爲無目的之投彈、圖破壤我軍陣地、我軍洞燭其奸、亦全綫報以重砲、我空軍同時出動驅逐敵機、一時空中機關槍聲軋軋、激戰甚烈、拂曉後、砲聲漸稀、負嵎吳淞之敵又乘機衝擊、旋被我軍擊退、被困羅店殘敵亦以重砲矗擊我陣地、今晨砲聲更烈、迄午猶未止、我軍沈着還擊、陣地無變動、又今晨七時半敵機十五架在滬西北新涇周家橘中山路等處亂投重量炸彈、隆隆之聲、不絕於耳、無辜市民死傷者達三百餘人之多、日機此種殘暴行爲、實係向全世界人類挑戰云、</p>
<p>（本報特訊）敵軍節節敗退後、又向東京乞援、昨有大批敵艦、共計四十餘艘、係商船與運輸艦、混合組成、集結吳淞口外、計共運來二師團援軍、昨晚今晨、大部份援軍已在吳淞登陸、聞卽於日內下全綫總攻擊令、企圖突出重圍、我軍正嚴陣以待、屆時决予以迎頭痛擊、</p>
<h3>吳淞肉搏血戰</h3>
<p>前綫步隊混作一團　猛烈爭奪我軍勝利</p>
<p>（本報特訊）被我軍進迫後、退處吳淞江濱之敵、昨晚曾有多次極猛烈之反攻、向我軍陣地進擊、仍有進犯寶山月浦之企圖、江中敵艦、密集炮火、向我陣地轟炸、以掩護其步隊之前進、我軍後方炮隊、亦整時立卽予以還擊、於是除雙方前綫步隊血戰肉搏、混作一團、作猛烈之爭奪外、雙方砲隊亦展開空前之炮戰、同時飛機在空中各自活動、火球飛舞之外、敵機之照明彈復在夜空加以點綴、今晨拂曉後、炮聲漸稀、敵軍終於被迫後退、今日午刻雙方之砲戰又起、迄未稍息、</p>
<p>羅店全綫被圍之敵、昨晚亦屢團反攻、砲聲隆隆、澈宵不絕、仍在我軍重圍之中、</p>
<h3>敵援軍集吳淞口外</h3>
<p>運輸輪載大批馬匹</p>
<p>（本報特訊）敵軍在滬作戰、先後開到援軍三個師團、連日在羅店·吳淞·瀏河各地、又經我軍痛擊、死亡無算、其侵入羅店者、更爲我大軍包圍、敵方乃再電東京、求派援軍二個師團、現在該批援軍、已由運輸艦、及軍艦四十餘艘、從該國開來上海、業經陸續到達吳淞口外三夾水一帶、擇地拋泊、每運輸船二三艘、恒有軍艦一艘保護、該批援軍、現正在吳淞外設法、謀得上陣的地點、據進日之某輸船員言、渠見有數運輸船中、且載有大批馬匹、想爲敵軍之騎隊、或爲拖砲所用者、吳淞口外情形又趨緊張、故今日洋商輪亦無進口也、</p>
<p>黃浦江敵艦、今日上午、尚無大變動、自經英美法三國總領要求日方將軍艦下移到招商局北棧以下、日方似尚未履行、日旗艦出雲、今仍泊二號河筒、而在三菱碼頭之二十三隊驅逐艦兩艘、依然靠泊、但已掉頭向東、其他楊樹浦匯山碼頭一帶駐艦、仍如前狀</p>
<h3>敵機暴行詳記</h3>
<p>北新涇周家橋被炸　死傷平民三百餘人　三時止尚在轟炸中</p>
<p>（本報特訊）日機之暴行、仍在繼續進行之中、昨日敵機一架、被我駐防軍在中山路擊落後、敵機野心不死、急圖報復、今晨七時、隆隆之轟炸聲、震動全市、滬西之沉靜空氣、頓爲之打破、敵機十五架、在兆豐公園之西、白利南路北新涇一帶、大施轟炸、死傷者皆無辜平民、以周家橋陳家渡及北新涇鎮兩處、受害最烈、據目下統計、兩處死傷、死者約計六七十人、傷者三百餘人、此種轟炸無辜平民之殘酷行爲、將更爲舉世所唾罵、</p>
<p>周家橋</p>
<p>敵機分兩大隊、在周家橋陳家渡方面出現者、共計九架、投彈十餘枚、平民之被炸死傷者、死二十餘人、傷者一百餘人、經救護隊趕往救護後、一部份受伤者、送入仁濟医院、其他则送紅十字會醫院、周家橋一帶工廠之被害者有遠東木廠、昇昌石粉廠、等等、其他各處尚在調查之中、轟炸之時、鄕民四避、俱向租界兆豐公園方面奔走、半小時之後、敵機方逸去、又在其他附近村落田野投彈、周圍盤旋、至午尚在、</p>
<p>北新涇</p>
<p>本報記者於今日中午十二時許、特驅車擬親往北新涇及周家橋兩地視察、詎車抵白利南路西端、經該處崗警力阻前進、並指示上空謂、敵機六架尚在原處各地繼續轟炸、卽各慈善團體救護人員、亦不能前往施救云云、記者無奈、祇得暫止該處、但見難民奔逃不絕、肩屍擔傷、途爲之塞、傷心慘目、不忍卒睹、記者旋晤及普善山莊掩埋隊職員陸君、據告、該處自得到周家橋及北新涇各地敵機轟炸死傷多人報告後、立卽率隊先赴周家橋施救、比抵該處、祗見死傷累累、厥狀之慘、等於南站、且均屬貧苦難民、死傷最多者、係一已廢之石灰窰中、蓋被難者瞥見大隊敵機飛至、均會皇逃入窑中、致敵機目標乃集中該處、轟炸掃射、益趨兇惡、而附近一帶草屋、均坡炸燬落於浜內，當時經敞處收殮之屍身約三十餘具、傷者尚不在內、不料二次再往急救時、已無法前往、蓋敵機仍有六架、尚在原處各地繼續猛轟中、於是北新涇方面之百餘死傷者、竟無法救出、敵機之絕滅人道、實屬舉世所不容云、截至本報截稿時、下午三時止、敵機仍在繼續肆暴中、</p>
<h3>大批敵軍滬東登陸</h3>
<p>楊樹浦方面另有企圖　將有大規模攻聲模樣</p>
<p>（本報特訊）吳淞各綫、自敵軍總攻失敗後、已在退集整理、等待後援、據來自虹口區之西人方面消息、昨今兩日、日軍結集於楊樹浦一帶者、爲數極衆、自楊樹浦大連郵船會社碼頭登陸之援軍、如潮擁上、步兵之外、尚有不少坦克車及重砲等卸下、飛機運岸裝配者、其數亦甚多、據西人方面之觀察、楊樹浦方面、敵軍似乎有所企圖、恐一俟登陸援軍分配完竣之後、楊樹浦一帶、敵軍將開始作大規模之攻擊云、</p>
<p>敵軍侵滬、受我軍嚴重打擊後、曾增援三師團來華、圖在吳淞瀏河寶山等地登陸、襲一二八時故智、企圖襲我軍後方、經我軍奮勇抵抗後、業已將殘敵包圍、已無發展餘地、乃現又向東京乞援、再增兩師團來滬、已於昨日抵達淞口、一部份於昨日下午夜由敵運輸輪五艘、駛進浦江在黃浦碼頭附近停泊、似擬增援虹口被圍之敵軍、至於其餘部隊、欲在何處上陸、侷促未能决定、其進口之五輪、已於今晨駛回口外、似已完畢其任務云、</p>
<h3>其美路口黑夜鏖戰</h3>
<p>敵不絕開槍摸索前來　我取三面包圍殺敵五十</p>
<p>其美路方面、連日無大接觸、昨夜九時許、敵軍忽自狄思威路口開槍數百發、我軍以此爲敵人慣技、置之不理、移時、復有敵三四十人、不動聲色、摸索前來、約距百米之處、我軍取三面包圍形勢、一鼓作氣、殺得敵人片甲不留、詎又有百餘敵軍、從後追趕而來、亂開機槍、火力甚猛、我方亦以機槍還擊、歷十五分鐘、敵自動退走、</p>
<p>咱夜九時許、江灣路八字橋方面、突有敵軍三百餘、向我陣地進犯、以步槍機槍不斷射擊、我軍不動聲色、約廿分鐘後、距我陳地愈迫愈近、號角一聲、紛紛躍出戰壕、對準目標、頻以手溜彈機槍密集射擲、敵已應聲倒地、我軍立卽向前衝殺、敵不示弱、援兵又至、我軍奮勇百倍、以一當十、混戰一時半、敵乃潰退、生還者約百餘人云、</p>
<h3>焚燬敵機證實擊落</h3>
<p>今晨我軍事機關證實　兩機師殘骸檢獲姓名</p>

<h3>浦東情形今晨沉寂</h3>
<p>商店多已開門營業　我軍陣地毫無損害</p>
<p>日軍進窺浦東之行動失敗後、戰事沉寂、沿浦各市鎭、已回復平靜狀態、扼上南交通要口之塘橋鎭、於前日砲戰激烈時、雖有砲彈多枚墮落、但僅有極少數民房轟毀、今晨街道上商店已半開排門應市、菜担尤多、上街買菜者、己頗擁擠、董家渡對江民營輪渡、亦照常開駛、且所收渡資與平時一律、老白渡鎭與楊家渡鎭在戰事之前、本未受若何影響、惟以居民已大部離去、頗形冷落、沿街菜担尚多、顧客較少、平日最熱鬧之賴義渡區域、於三日午後受砲火較多、故有若干市房、或擊毀屋頂、或轟倒墻壁、所留居民極少、各商店仍於晨間應市、以維若輩生活、惟身入其間、異常寂靜、至三萬昌以北、爲警戒綫區域、禁止行人通過、祇可繞道後街通行、故春江碼頭大火後之境象、未能入目、其昌棧鎭密接浦中日艦、居民已搬遷一空、無足紀述、再東爲洋涇鎭、於滬戰發動之後、受害最重、蓋以附近十八間頭向爲窩藏匪類之處、此次匪衆、竟爲虎作倀、故日機前數日每日前往擲彈、估計不下一百餘枚、致半成瓦礫之場、此輩匪黨、乃肆意搜刦、但細軟之物、居民早已携開、匪等對粗笨家具床鋪檯桌均要、聞若輩以所刦之木器、又不能搬至浦西或別處、故設法隱藏、以迨時局平靜後、再行變賣、此種喪心病狂之匪徒、殺之猶有餘辜、以上所述、爲記者於今晨以自由車至各鎭觀察戰後情况時所得者也、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>日廣田外相。近在官邸招待外國記者。發表談話。稱。“日本對華用兵目的。在維護旣得權益。並建立東亞永久和平”云云。此二語殊不可解。㊀欲維護卽得權益。必須對華用兵。但英法美諸國。在華旣得權益。亦屬不少。何以並不用兵。難道他們不維護旣得權益麽。又維護旣得權益。必須用兵。若侵略未得權益。當更用何法。㊁欲建立東亞和平必須對華用兵。是欲和平。必須開戰。反之。欲開戰必須和平麽。此話從何講起。並且開戰後。是否能得到東亞永久和平。我恐廣田先生未必有此把握。</p>

<h3>The Enemy Has Been Repeatedly Defeated and Has Augmented Reinforcements Three Times; Our Front Lines Are Consolidated, Awaiting an Opportunity to Strike Hard</h3>
<p>The enemy's riverside positions have been cut off and surrounded by our forces. The enemy suffered a disastrous defeat in the air and on land, with extremely high casualties. Yesterday, enemy planes ran rampant but two were shot down by our forces.</p>
<p>Since the enemy troops landed in Shanghai for the second time, another week has passed. They have remained confined to a corner, unable to make any progress. Their attacks on our positions in recent days have been met with heavy blows. Their soldiers have suffered heavy casualties, and their morale has plummeted. Moreover, the enemy units in the Hongkou, Yangshupu, Wusong, and Luodian districts have been cut off by our heavy forces. Not only have they failed to realize their dream of breaking through, but the remaining enemy forces in the Luodian district have been surrounded by our forces and are in a sorry state. The enemy commander-in-chief Matsui, in defeat, has had no choice but to once again request reinforcements from Tokyo. The reinforcements, consisting of about two divisions and military supplies, arrived yesterday morning on 49 transport ships outside the port of Wusong and are preparing to land. Matsui has also announced to the foreign press that he will launch a full-scale offensive against our entire line early next week. Our frontline military authorities, upon hearing of the enemy's reinforcements, believe that it is an inevitable move after suffering setbacks. As for the announced general offensive, they consider it a form of intimidation. After arriving in Shanghai, Matsui has repeatedly issued orders for a general offensive. Between the 26th and 27th of last month, he even declared to the military authorities of various countries stationed in Shanghai that the Shanghai battle would be completely concluded and restored to its original state by the end of the month. However, the current situation has fully demonstrated the futility of intimidation. In short, our army, with a spirit of not being arrogant in victory or discouraged in defeat, has adopted a steady and solid approach. Even if the enemy reinforcements continue to arrive, we are determined to be ready for them and inflict heavy blows. We are confident about the future of the war.</p>
<p>At about one o'clock this morning, our artillery positions in Zhabei [text unclear] fired more than ten shells at the enemy positions in the Hongkou area. The enemy remained silent and did not dare to retaliate. Our side then stopped firing. After a while, an enemy plane flew over Pudong to reconnoiter, and then left after a long time.</p>
<h3>Luodian: We are Pressing Close to Sunjiaqiao</h3>
<p>Confirmed information: Our army in the Luodian area is advancing victoriously, pressing close to Sunjiaqiao, and has occupied Nanchang Bridge and Tanshe Bridge, linking up with our army in the southeast corner of Luodian.</p>
<p>The battle of Luodian has been extremely fierce in recent days. The besieged enemy has repeatedly tried to break out, but has been repelled by our forces. Our army is launching a fierce attack from three directions simultaneously, making rapid progress. The enemy's positions are shrinking further. It is estimated that there is still a brigade of the enemy's forces surrounded. After days of fighting, they have suffered heavy casualties. Last night, our army achieved considerable success in one of the routes attacking Xiaochuanshakou. The enemy's retreat route has been almost completely cut off. Two-thirds of Luodian town is under our control. The enemy has virtually no room for maneuver in this small area. Yesterday morning, the enemy launched several fierce breakout attempts, resulting in extremely fierce fighting. The enemy was repulsed in a chaotic manner under our army's bayonet charge.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Regarding the enemy in the Luodian area, after our army launched a surprise attack from the northwest corner of Xiaochuansha the day before yesterday, harassing the enemy's rear, it has completed a four-sided encirclement. The enemy launched several counterattacks the night before last, attempting to break through the encirclement. However, they were repeatedly subjected to dense machine gun fire by our army, resulting in heavy casualties and a retreat. As of yesterday morning, the enemy was still heavily surrounded by our forces. Their attempts to break out have not succeeded.</p>
<h3>Enemy Brigade Commander Kuranaga Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that our army killed an enemy brigade commander during the fierce fighting in Luodian on the 29th of last month, but the name had not yet been confirmed. According to the extra edition of the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun on the 30th of last month, the enemy troops fighting in Luodian consisted of three brigades, and the brigade commanders were Kuranaga, Takanori, and Takeda. The one killed on that day was Kuranaga, who was killed by our artillery fire. The extra edition of the newspaper also published a photograph of Kuranaga.</p>
<h3>The Remaining Enemy Forces in Wusong Collapse and Retreat to the Riverside</h3>
<p>The enemy in Wusong, pressed by our large army, has collapsed and retreated to the riverside, gathering along the riverbanks. The enemy warships in the Huangpu River near Wusong fired on our positions the night before last, covering their infantry's advance and retreat. Our rear artillery units immediately returned fire. The two sides exchanged fire until yesterday morning, when the artillery fire subsided. Our army positions, despite being under intense enemy artillery fire, continued to pursue the enemy and advance forward, making active progress. The enemy's plan to attack Shishan and Yuepu has completely failed. Furthermore, news from the military: The enemy troops in the Wusong town area divided their forces into one route the night before last, launching a sneak attack on our positions in the southeast corner of Yuepu town. They were met with resistance from our army, and a fierce battle ensued. By dawn yesterday morning, the enemy could no longer hold out and retreated. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, killing many enemies and advancing our positions by two miles. The enemy did not dare to attack again. The Shishan area also remained calm. (Further news) Yesterday morning, our army again sent out troops to attack, making contact with the enemy troops at Taixing Road and Tongji Road, resulting in fierce street fighting. The two sides fought hand-to-hand until noon. Our soldiers shouted and killed, engaging in a bloody battle. As a result, the remaining enemy forces on the western front retreated to the north of the Yunzaobang Canal. On the central front, our army continued to advance along the railway. There was no trace of the enemy in Paotaiwan. According to a military officer at the front line yesterday, the enemy entrenched in Wusong will be completely eliminated soon. After defeating the remaining enemy forces on the western front of Wusong, our army has moved into the sugar factory.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces Attack North Station, Retreat in Defeat</h3>
<p>Since the enemy forces in the Hongkou area withdrew their marines and replaced them with regular army reinforcements some days ago, enemy army units that had arrived from Wusong the night before last launched an attack on our North Station area at about 3:30 yesterday morning, hoping to break through the encirclement and make another attempt. Our army retaliated with mortars, resulting in intense artillery fire. The enemy could not hold out and retreated.</p>
<p>At 0:20 this morning, enemy fire attacked our Zhabei area. In addition to dense machine gun fire, our artillery positions in [text unclear] also used heavy artillery and mortars to attack the enemy positions in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas for a long time. The enemy suffered heavy losses, and the attacking enemy retreated in a chaotic manner.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Enemy Reinforcements Have Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to reliable information, 49 enemy transport ships (mostly converted from merchant ships) carrying a large number of reinforcements and munitions arrived in the waters 50 nautical miles outside the port of Wusong the night before last. As of yesterday morning, they were still anchored there, seemingly ready to launch a large-scale attack on our positions.</p>
<p>Two more enemy merchant ships entered the Huangpu River the night before last. One, named Gonkonmaru, docked at the northern wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. The ship was loaded with a large number of straw mats. According to knowledgeable sources, these straw mats are used to wrap the bodies of enemy soldiers who have died. Another, named Calcutta Maru, docked at the Gonghexiang wharf, carrying a large amount of military supplies. In addition, an enemy transport ship named Kiurgasa Maru sailed to the central wharf of the China Merchants Bureau before dawn yesterday morning. A large amount of military equipment was immediately unloaded. The above three ships then loaded enemy wounded soldiers and corpses, and sailed back to Japan successively at 11:15 am, 3 pm, and 5:25 pm yesterday.</p>
<h3>Heavy Losses Among Enemy Air Force Personnel</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that, according to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, the number of Japanese air force personnel killed and missing from August 20th to 27th was as follows: 20th, three; 21st, Jurong three, Yangzhou one, Nanjing thirteen, Suzhou one, Nanchang one; 22nd, Shanghai one (squadron leader); 23rd, Shanghai two, Nanjing five; 24th, Shanghai two; 26th, missing one; 27th, missing nine; totaling 42. This does not include those who fought in Hangzhou, Guangde, and other places, which shows the seriousness of their losses.</p>
<h3>Major Fires in Hongkou and Pudong Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council reported that a major fire broke out behind the Meilun Middle School at about 7 am yesterday. The major fire in Pudong burned overnight and was extinguished only yesterday morning. Fires broke out in the Haisheng Road and Oujia Road areas between 8 am. The situation was relatively calm between 8 am and 9 am. There were five or six fires between Zhoujiazui Road and Meilun Middle School. There was also a fire near the Bazilu and Hesike'er Road, which was quite intense. The following four locations also caught fire between 9 am and 10 am: (1) the intersection of Aierjin Road and Beijiangxi Road; (2) the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Haining Road (firefighters from the concession have rushed to put out the fires in the above two locations); (3) the station building of the Maigen Road (caused by bombing); (4) near the Anli warehouse in Pudong.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forbids Foreigners from Going to Yangshupu</h3>
<p>The Shenzhou News Agency reported that since the Shanghai war expanded outwards, the Japanese army has allowed foreigners to freely enter and exit the Yangshupu area. However, starting yesterday afternoon, the Japanese army issued a notice warning foreigners not to enter the Yangshupu area without permission. As a result, foreigners who wanted to move their belongings from that area were turned back. It is said that foreign journalists who have passes can still enter and exit the Hongkou area, but the Japanese army will not be responsible if any danger occurs.</p>
<h3>In Two Days, the Enemy Suffered Over 8,000 Casualties Along the River and Coast</h3>
<p>Most Deaths in the Battle of Wusong; Large Numbers of Corpses Thrown into the Sea</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that, in recent days, the enemy attempted to complete a certain line of communication in places such as Luodian and Wusong, and launched fierce attacks on our positions. Our army responded calmly, and the enemy ultimately failed to succeed. According to reliable sources, since the enemy began attacking our positions on the night of the 1st of this month, they have suffered extremely heavy casualties on all fronts in two days, with over 5,000 killed and over 3,000 wounded. Among them, the battle of Wusong saw the most deaths, reaching over 3,000, followed by Luodian, Zhanghuabang, and other places. A large number of corpses were loaded onto a transport ship near Zhanghuabang at about 5 am on the 3rd and sailed out of the port. It is said that these corpses were thrown into the sea outside Sanjiashui and will not be transported back to their home country.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Run Rampant, Dropping Bombs Everywhere; Two Were Shot Down by Our Forces Yesterday</h3>
<p>Stray Bullets Fly Everywhere, Non-Combat Zones Are Also Affected; Refugee Convoys Are Also Straffed</p>
<p>Yesterday, enemy planes, in groups, bombed and strafed Zhabei and western Shanghai from dawn to dusk. At noon, an enemy plane flew very low over the Maigen Road area in Zhabei. Before long, it dropped a bomb and sped upwards. As it was about to continue dropping bombs, its tail suddenly caught fire, and smoke billowed around it. With its engines damaged, it plummeted like a fire dragon straight down from the sky, crashing to the ground. The bombs inside the plane immediately exploded, sending a thunderous roar throughout the city. Many citizens of the special district witnessed the enemy plane crashing. At the time, it was suspected that the enemy plane had exploded on its own. It was not until last night that a report was received from the front line confirming that it had been shot down by our forces. The reason was that at 1:15 pm yesterday, three enemy planes were flying low and dropping bombs near Zhongshan Road. Wu Qiujian, the commander of a certain regiment of a certain division of our army, ordered the adjutant Zhang Zhige and the company commander Hong Ce to command the anti-aircraft battalion to launch a surprise attack with anti-aircraft guns, cannons, and anti-aircraft machine guns. In an instant, bullets flew like snow, and the oil tank of one enemy plane was destroyed, causing a fire to break out. The fuselage was completely burned, and black smoke billowed. It fell on the cemetery of the Guangzhao Mountain Villa on Guangzhao Road. Soldiers of the regiment then found the head of the enemy plane's pilot, machine gun fragments, etc., at the anti-aircraft position, with the words "Made in Nagoya" on them. The words "December, Showa 11" were also on the burned wing of the plane. It is reported that the division sent specialists to transport the fuselage to Nanjing. In addition, another enemy plane was shot down by our army at 2 pm yesterday while flying very low and dropping bombs in the North Station area. The fuselage crashed and was burned, and the pilot died on the spot.</p>
<p>At around 7 am yesterday morning, more than ten enemy planes appeared over Shanghai again, circling for a long time, and carried out bombing raids in Zhabei and Huacao Town in western Shanghai. In addition to some houses being destroyed, no casualties were reported. By about 9 am, most of the enemy planes had left, but two planes continued to drop bombs in Zhabei, and fires broke out in several places.</p>
<p>Yesterday, several enemy planes circled over the city all day and fired machine guns indiscriminately, resulting in shell fragments and stray bullets flying everywhere in the non-combat zones of the two concessions, the South City, and Pudong. No fewer than 50 or 60 residents were killed or injured. Ambulances were dispatched everywhere, and people were extremely anxious. Details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Enemy planes have been bombing Zhabei, the South City, and Pudong for days. They also strafed refugees, charity groups, and rescuers who were not involved in the war with machine guns, which is truly inhumane. The two concession areas were also affected. A large number of shells, anti-aircraft shells, and shell fragments landed in the concessions the day before yesterday. The Municipal Council ambulances were dispatched to 32 locations, and a total of 46 injured people were transported to various hospitals. Most of them were injured by stray bullets. Fire engines were also quite busy. Furthermore, at 5:45 pm yesterday, an anti-aircraft shell landed on the race course, injuring two members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, W.G. Nicholls and M.P. Doyle. Also, at 2:10 pm the day before yesterday, a member of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps (Russian unit), Kosnyreff, was wounded by shell fragments on the Bund of Beijing Road. At 6:30 am yesterday, a bomb suddenly exploded at the back door of the Jiangnan Small Inn at the junction of the French and Chinese concessions, injuring more than ten people who were sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, a hand grenade exploded at the base of the wall in Tingyun Lane near the area, killing Peng Dawei, a Yancheng native who was in the used goods business, on the spot, and injuring more than ten people. The police are now strictly investigating the source of the explosives. Also, at 9:15 am, a small cannon shell landed in the parking lot of the Hed Road tram company, but did not explode. Stray bullets also landed at the entrance of the Xinhua Bank on Heping Road in the South City, near Xiaonanmen, in Suozilong in the city, and in Hexing Lane on Jingxiu Road. It is said that these bullets were fired by enemy planes when they were flying low. The city's police departments are now conducting strict investigations and are taking meticulous precautions to prevent traitors from infiltrating and causing trouble. At the same time, between 6 am and 7 am yesterday morning, a large squadron of Japanese planes flew through the public concession area. As soon as the planes flew over various places, bombs and other explosives fell, and there were also machine gun strafing in many places, causing a considerable number of deaths and injuries. As a result, ambulances were dispatched one after another, and Renji and Baolong hospitals were almost full. The information obtained from the investigation is recorded below, and there are likely many others that have not been identified. (1) Five people were injured at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Ningbo Road; (2) one person was injured at the intersection of Tianjin Road and Zhejiang Road; (3) two people were injured across from the Tongchang Motor Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road; (4) two were killed and three injured on Danshui Road; (5) several were injured near the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road; (6) a ticket inspector was injured at the ticket booth of the tram company on Haig Road; (7) two children were killed at the entrance of the Dazhong Lane at the intersection of South Chengdu Road and Tongfu Road. One was Shen Ren, 14 years old, from Jiaxing, residing at No. 140 Dazhong Lane. The other was Zhou Peigen, 9 years old, residing at No. 107, Lane 638, Xinzha Road. Both children were hit by machine gun bullets from enemy planes. Locations (1) and (5) were strafed by machine guns, and the rest were injured by small bombs, which shows the recklessness and inhumanity of the Japanese planes. In addition, the roof of the Chengdu Road police station was also hit by a stray bullet at 6:50 am yesterday, which only destroyed a portion of the building, fortunately without injuring anyone. At 6:30 am yesterday, two enemy planes flew to the North Station area to bomb. When our army opened fire with machine guns, a shell fell near the Jing'an Temple, not far from the police station, injuring a Chinese man. Also, when enemy planes bombed the North Station yesterday morning, it was reported that 25 people were injured in the Xinzha area, and six were injured in the Laozha area. Several people were also injured in the Chengdu Road area. At 9:10 am, an enemy plane dropped a bomb in the air above the railway junction on Maigen Road. At 10:50 am, enemy planes dropped four bombs near the North Station. One of them fell on Aierjin Road, very close to the concession. Another one seemed to not have exploded. A total of 16 people were injured by enemy artillery fire in Pudong and have been sent to hospitals separately. The injuries of each person are as follows: (1) Gu Xia, Liu Xingren, head injured by machine gun; (2) Sun Siyuan, from Beiping, head injured by bomb shrapnel; (3) Xia Mingshan, from Shandong, left hand severed by artillery shell; (4) Xu Fulin, from Yangzhou, left kneecap broken by artillery shell; (5) Xu Fashu, from Tongzhou, left foot injured by artillery shell; (6) Li Amao, from Ningbo, left arm severed and left leg injured by bomb; (7) Xia Meidi, from Chongming, left scapula injured by gunfire; (8) Wu Li, from Pudong, left and right waist injured by artillery shell; (9) Yao Wenru, from Nantong, foot injured by bomb; (10) Wu Shiliang, from Pudong, right leg injured by artillery shell; (11) Zhang Longgen, from Pudong, right hand and leg injured by artillery shell; (12) Zhang Zhao, from Pudong, leg injured by bomb; (13) Li Jianchu, from Dinghai, slightly injured; (14) Wang Yin, from Hubei, arm and lower body injured by bomb; (15) Chen Li, from Pudong, hand and back injured by bomb; (16) Wu Jufen, local, arm and left leg injured by artillery shell.</p>
<p>Some days ago, when a rescue team escorted a large number of refugees from Shanghai by small steamship to Suzhou, they were followed by enemy planes for as long as three hours. At times, they fired machine guns downwards, causing panic among the refugees and nearly causing an accident. After making every effort to evade, they were spared disaster. The enemy planes repeatedly shot at our unarmed refugees, which is extremely cruel.</p>
<h3>There are as Many as 130 Enemy Warships and Vessels Outside the Port of Wusong and in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>The Number of Warships and Vessels Sailing to Shanghai is so Vast; It is Clearly Seen That They are Willing to Stake Everything</p>
<p>After the enemy's attempt to invade our coastal and riverside ports failed, the enemy warships in the Huangpu River launched a fierce bombardment of our Pudong positions the day before yesterday, attempting to cover the enemy's landing. After our army's calm resistance, they ultimately failed to succeed. The three newest-type destroyers of the enemy's 6th Squadrons, Hibiki, Tkodzuka, and Tnazuma, which fired the most on our Pudong positions the day before yesterday, anchored behind the Japanese Consulate, sailed out of the Port of Wusong in disappointment before dawn yesterday morning. According to an investigation by reporters yesterday, there are a total of over 90 enemy warships of all sizes outside the Port of Wusong, including the 49 transport ships (mostly converted from merchant ships) that recently sailed to Shanghai. Including the enemy warships in the Huangpu River and Liuhe area, the total number should be around 130. The fact that so many enemy warships have sailed to Shanghai further shows the enemy's anxiety and willingness to stake everything after their invasion of our country failed. The distribution of the 19 enemy warships in the Huangpu River yesterday is listed below: five floating gunboats No. 5 and No. 24, one floating destroyer No. 18 Nagasaki (belonging to the 22nd Squadron), one floating destroyer No. 15 Munisaki, one floating destroyer No. 14 (belonging to the 21st Squadron), one floating gunboat No. 11 Rotaka, two floating destroyers No. 7 (belonging to the 21st Squadron), two floating destroyers No. 6 (belonging to the 30th Squadron), one floating flagship Izumo No. 2, one floating destroyer No. 1 (belonging to the 16th Squadron), three transport ships at the Yangshupu wharf, one destroyer at the Pudong Xin Mitsui wharf, one cruiser at the Huishan wharf, one destroyer at the northern wharf of the China Merchants Bureau (belonging to the 21st Squadron), and one destroyer at the Mitsubishi wharf, for a total of 19 ships. There were over 100 enemy soldiers at the northern wharf of the China Merchants Bureau and over 60 enemy soldiers at the Huangpu wharf, all of whom were busy transporting military supplies.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Authorities of Various Countries Stationed in Shanghai Sent Notes to the Enemy and Us</h3>
<p>Requesting Our Army and Enemy Warships to Move Slightly to Avoid Further Danger in the Concessions</p>
<p>The military authorities of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France stationed in Shanghai, citing the fierce artillery battle between the Japanese warships anchored in the Huangpu River in front of the Japanese Consulate on the 3rd of this month and our Pudong artillery, which resulted in a large number of stray bullets falling in the public and French concessions, causing significant losses of life and property, requested the consuls general of their respective countries stationed in Shanghai to send notes to our country and Japan yesterday, requesting that Japanese warships should move below the northern wharf of the China Merchants Bureau, and our Pudong troops should move east of Pudong Road and south of Zhangjiabang. It is reported that the note sent to our country has been forwarded to the military authorities by Mayor Yu.</p>
<h3>The Powers Are Implementing Economic Sanctions as a Just Means Against Japan</h3>
<p>American Labor Unions Advocate Economic Severance with Japan; To Avoid World War, It is Necessary to Curb Militarism; Song Ziwen's Interview with Reporters from the American Zhiye News Agency</p>
<p>A reporter from the Associated Press visited Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Council, yesterday. He was granted an audience and made the following remarks: "The report that American labor unions are now organizing and advocating economic severance with Japan is gratifying. This proves that the common people's understanding of fundamental issues is often more reliable than the lengthy considerations of international experts. If Japan defeats China one day and utilizes its countless resources, all peace-loving countries will inevitably be greatly threatened. When the September 18th Incident occurred, those who sought temporary peace often said that after Japan annexed the three northeastern provinces, it would be busy consolidating and would have no time to invade other parts of the country. However, in fact, Japan has already occupied a large part south of the Great Wall, and is now seeking to advance and invade the Yangtze River Basin, threatening China's financial and economic center, as well as the only location where foreign businesses have made large-scale investments. Since the September 18th Incident, international morality has declined, and a world war is brewing rapidly. To prevent Japan's militarism from advancing and to eliminate the occurrence of a world war, all peace-loving people believe that economic sanctions should be implemented by the great powers advocating democracy as the only just means. It is feared that those in power will continue to adopt a hesitant and compromising attitude, repeating the same mistakes and regretting it later."</p>

<h3>Special Parliament Opens Amidst Reports of Japanese Military Setbacks</h3>
<p>Debating a ¥2 Billion Military Budget: Total Amount to Exceed Expenses of the Russo-Japanese War. British and American Newspapers Comment on Japan's Risky Actions.</p>
<p>[London] According to reports here, the Sino-Japanese battles in Shanghai have intensified again recently. Chinese troops on the Liuhe, Luodian, and Wusong line have broken through multiple enemy positions. Chinese troops in the Pudong area also hold an advantageous position. Foreign military observers in Shanghai say the Japanese army must be extremely cautious, otherwise they will be forced to retreat into the Yangtze and Huangpu Rivers. (4th, Guomin Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Telegrams received here from various parts of China claim that the fighting in Shanghai has intensified again in recent days. The strong resistance of the Chinese army has been unexpectedly fierce. Simultaneously, Chinese troops have reinforced with a large amount of artillery and fresh troops. The situation in North China is relatively quiet, with only minor skirmishes along the Chahar-Suiyuan border. Japanese planes bombed the railway near Machang. The report states that neither the battles in North China nor Shanghai will be decided in a few days. (4th, Guomin Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese special parliament held its opening ceremony today. Tomorrow, cabinet ministers will give speeches on the so-called "China Incident." A special military expenditure of ¥2,220,000,000 and an additional budget of ¥42,000,000 for general accounting will be discussed. The majority of the funds for the temporary military expenses will be raised by issuing public bonds. The total budget for this year will therefore reach a staggering ¥5,470,000,000. The amount of public bonds issued this year will be ¥3,300,000,000 to ¥3,400,000,000. The entire cost of the Russo-Japanese War was only ¥1,500,847,000. The total military budget for the Sino-Japanese Incident, including the previous and current appropriations, amounts to over ¥2,500,000,000, which is truly considerable. (4th, Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to reports here, since the "Sino-Japanese Incident" occurred, Japanese commerce has suffered a major blow, with small and medium-sized merchants and those specializing in exports being the most severely affected. So far this year, the excess of imports over exports has reached an unprecedented high of ¥77,400,000, compared to only ¥21,400,000 in the same period last year. (3rd, TASS Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] The U.S. Department of Commerce announced today that in the first half of 1937, Japan's excess of imports reached ¥175,000,000, the highest amount since 1924. During this period, Japan's exports increased by 24.4% and imports increased by 44%. Military supplies accounted for a large portion of the excess imports, including aircraft parts valued at ¥832,883. (3rd, Guomin Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Washington Post published an editorial today criticizing the situation in the Far East, stating that the fundamental interests of the United States and other countries are being harmed by Japanese aggression. It is necessary to assess the true nature, weaknesses, and arrogance of Tokyo. The United States and other countries must adopt a calm and resolute attitude to make Japan understand that beyond a certain point, it cannot hope for its risky actions to be rewarded. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said that all groups that believe in peace and an orderly adjustment of international relations have a matter of life and death at stake in this. How true those words are. Submissive surrender will not prevent violence, and enduring unbearable insults will not maintain lasting benefits. The actions Japan is taking now set a precedent. If they are not checked, it will only encourage other bullies to follow suit. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The Times commented on Japan's wartime budget of ¥2,549,000,000 today, stating that Japan clearly hopes that the collapse of Chinese resistance will guarantee an early victory for Japan. However, it is dangerous to assume that this war will be limited in scope and short in duration. Japan's aims are vague and unlimited, and the length of the war may worry the Japanese General Staff. In this continuing struggle, what Japan has succeeded in doing is closing the markets that its politicians and economists consider the lifeline of the Japanese economy. Even if Japan wins, the extraordinary expenditure of the country's treasury will not stop immediately after the war ends. Even if the land where it decides to establish its power after the victory is limited, it will have to pay a heavy price, and the work will be extremely difficult. Japan's continental policy clearly shows a certain degree of irresponsibility, and the Japanese military has begun to control other national institutions. The wartime budget is increasing dramatically. This war is a more dangerous gamble than expected. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The Times also recently commented on the war between China and Japan, with particular emphasis on Japan's economic difficulties, saying, "China is vast in territory and resources, with a large population, and the government has unexpectedly gained the support of the entire population. Therefore, even if the country's troops are defeated, the central government may not be forced to surrender or collapse. In Japan, the very act of waging war is bound to increase the financial burden. Moreover, the war's protracted nature may not have been foreseen by the country's General Staff, making it even more difficult to cope with. Furthermore, even if Japan achieves victory during the war, the commercial markets that its politicians and economists consider to be its economic lifeline will inevitably collapse. In short, even if Japan achieves a great victory in this risky undertaking, it will be difficult to stop its policy of financial exploitation. Any attempt by Japan to establish a sphere of influence in any part of China will be a difficult and costly undertaking. Even if conquered, there is no direct benefit to be gained from organizing ruined territories in small, remote areas. Japan's unprofitable occupation of Manchuria is clear evidence of this." The conclusion is that if Japan cooperates with other countries, the benefits it can obtain will be less monopolistic but more practical than pursuing risky policies. (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Patriotism</h3>

<h3>Britain and the United States Said to Be Brewing a Ceasefire Movement</h3>
<p>British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen Meets with Hirota; U.S. Policy Remains Independent</p>
<p>[Washington] According to reliable sources from the Associated Press today, the British and American governments are currently making every effort to stop or reduce the scope of the Sino-Japanese conflict. (3rd, Guomin Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] British Ambassador to Japan Knatchbull-Hugessen, immediately upon his arrival, met with Foreign Minister Hirota this afternoon for two hours. The content of the discussion is unknown. (4th, Guomin Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently stated that the government has sent new instructions to U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson, advising American citizens to take advantage of the available opportunities to return home. Regarding reports of cooperation between Britain and the United States in Chinese waters, he said that the U.S. government is still pursuing an independent policy and is not shifting based on the policies of any other country. However, it is common sense for U.S. authorities to exchange information and consult with responsible authorities in other countries who are in the same position and have the same interests. "However, this kind of cooperative undertaking should not be confused with joint action." (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] U.S. Secretary of State Hull announced today that the State Department has issued a very strong warning to American citizens in its recent efforts, advising them to stay away from Shanghai and other war zones. Regarding rumors of close cooperation between Britain and the United States on the Far East situation, Hull said that the U.S. government's foreign policy is conducted separately and independently, but there are times when changes are made based on circumstances. The American Red Cross announced that it does not intend to send Red Cross personnel to China or hold a national fundraising campaign, but it is willing to represent Chinese relief efforts and accept donations from organizations and individuals. These donations should be sent to the Chinese Red Cross and other relief agencies. Red Cross Chairman Clayson also said that the Japanese Red Cross has refused foreign aid. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the recent loans made by several American banks to Japan, official sources recently stated that if the Neutrality Act is not implemented, the State Department cannot prevent these banks from lending to Japan and can only exert moral pressure. Therefore, some people argue that the Neutrality Act should be implemented immediately for the war between China and Japan. Based on the above facts, their arguments have become increasingly compelling. The government originally wanted to avoid implementing the Neutrality Act and is now concerned that increasing public pressure will force the government to implement the Neutrality Act. But in fact, the Neutrality Act cannot be applied to banks that made loans to Japan or China before the start of the war, and these banks can still freely extend the terms or increase the amount of these loans in the future. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Six American peace organizations today urged President Roosevelt to immediately implement the Neutrality Act for the Sino-Japanese war. They protested against the obstruction of the Vichytai, which was carrying airplanes and barbed wire to Shanghai. They expressed support for the President's decision to stop sending more warships to the Far East, believing that this move would increase the tension. They also said that the U.S. cannot continue to regard the conflict currently taking place in the Far East as non-warfare. The six peace organizations are: 1. National Council for the Prevention of War, 2. World Peace Movement, 3. Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, 4. Fellowship of Reconciliation, 5. Emergency Peace Campaign, 6. Committee on Militarism in Education. (2nd, Guomin Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Labor Movement to Formulate Political Program</h3>
<p>Measures to Guarantee Peace; a Large Conference to Be Held for Discussion</p>
<p>[London] The National Council of Labor, representing three important British labor organizations, today released a report on international policy and defense, stating that the British government must have "strong armaments to defend the country and strive for collective security, and resist the intimidation of fascist countries." The report outlines a dual policy of peace and argues that countries that have suffered injustice should be asked to state their situation, and that a new system of political security and economic opportunity should be provided through the League of Nations, eliminating the horrors of war and any legitimate economic grievances from international relations. The report continues that this new system should become part of a general mediation that will relieve current international tensions and indicate the hope for lasting peace. It also argues that the League of Nations should ensure that aggressors face an overwhelming military advantage. The report further states that the only current serious threats to peace are "Germany, Italy, and Japan, and it is aware of the possibility of these three countries forming an alliance." It concludes by saying that if the Labor Party regains power, the government will not change its current military build-up plan until the international situation changes. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The National Federation of Trade Unions is scheduled to hold its annual conference in Norwich next week. The National Executive Committee of the Labor Movement has drafted a report on the international situation and is preparing to submit it to the conference for discussion. The report states that the military strength of various countries in the world is unprecedented, and the vulnerability of British national defense is also unseen before. Therefore, it is necessary for the government to continue its military build-up plan, even if the Labor Party comes to power in the future. However, if the policies pursued by the British cabinet are based on the Labor Party platform, future wars can be avoided. The report concludes by advocating the establishment of international agreements to curb the arms race. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Mussolini to Visit Germany This Month</h3>
<p>Official German Announcement</p>
<p>[Berlin] Official news was released stating that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, at the invitation of Führer Hitler, is scheduled to visit Germany in the second half of this month to meet with the Führer. The semi-official German News Agency also issued a message stating that there are strong revolutionary movements in both Germany and Italy to establish institutions for changing the lives of nations and states, so both sides maintain close ideal ties. Italy's arrival will inevitably reaffirm this. Under the leadership of the Führer, the German nation has completed its unification under National Socialism. It is a great honor to hear that the Fascist Prime Minister of Italy will soon be visiting the country. According to semi-official sources, after arriving in Germany, the Italian Prime Minister may go to Pomerania to observe the German military, naval, and air force exercises, and then come to Berlin to hold talks with Führer Hitler. However, the details of the reception have not yet been fully decided. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Rome] It is widely believed that Prime Minister Mussolini's visit to Führer Hitler next month will not result in a new agreement. Prime Minister Mussolini's mouthpiece, Mr. Gayda, recently published a moderate article in the Italian Daily, discussing the meeting between the Italian Prime Minister and the German Führer, saying that Italy and Germany do not currently face the problem of choosing between a pro-British or pro-German policy. The speculation that the German-Italian talks will produce shocking events is highly inaccurate. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] According to various newspapers, the visit of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to Germany has major world significance. The consolidation of the Berlin-Rome Axis, the spiritual unity of the Nazi Party and the Fascist Party, and the joint defense of peace and Western culture can all be demonstrated by this. The Local Guidance Daily said, "Only German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini are the guarantors of peace in Europe. Mussolini's visit is intended to counter all acts that undermine peace with the great ideal of peaceful cooperation. There is no other purpose." The Nazi Party's newspaper, the People's Observer, said, "Since Hitler and Mussolini met in Venice, Italy, in the past, the national power of Germany and Italy has greatly increased, but the goals they seek are still the same as in the past, namely, to create a new Europe." Other newspapers all pointed out that the Berlin-Rome Axis is an element of stability in Europe and also a dawn for the future of European peace. (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Convene Mediterranean Conference</h3>
<p>Discussing Joint Action Against Pirates; Soviet Russia Prepares for Strong Measures; U.S. Also Implements Alert Measures</p>
<p>[Paris] The French Foreign Ministry is currently busy drafting the agenda for the Mediterranean Conference. The French Navy is playing an important role in this preparation. It is said that the purpose of the conference is to obtain a joint declaration that strongly condemns piracy and identifies the perpetrators. (4th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding France's proposal for a conference of Mediterranean countries to be held in Geneva, the British government has accepted it. Official sources recently stated that Britain will also put forward important proposals at that time, the content of which is based on mutual cooperation between the navies of the countries concerned, advocating that warships of any country on the Mediterranean coast should simultaneously protect the merchant ships of other countries, not limited to their own merchant ships. However, Britain has no intention of organizing an "international fleet" to escort merchant ships of various countries in the Mediterranean. In addition, France's original plan did not invite Italy to participate in the Geneva Conference. According to the latest news, Italy may be invited to attend. If so, the countries along the Black Sea, including Soviet Russia, must also participate at the same time. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding France's proposal for a conference of Mediterranean countries to be held in Geneva, British officials recently stated that the British government intends to put forward various proposals at this meeting, namely: 1. Submarines of all countries shall not navigate outside their territorial waters, but the boundaries of Spanish territorial waters may be slightly extended to facilitate the actions of submarines belonging to both sides of the civil war; 2. If submarines are found in the high seas of the Mediterranean, the countries concerned should impose collective sanctions, and if possible, try to sink them; 3. The countries along the Mediterranean coast should jointly issue a declaration to protect international shipping. It is said that the British proposal has been submitted to France, and France can accept it. In addition, although the parties involved in the Spanish civil war will not be invited to attend the conference, the British proposal will be submitted to both parties separately. It is heard that Spanish people expect that the Republican government of that country can accept the British proposal. British people say that the Spanish Republican government has more submarines than the Nationalist government, so the Nationalist authorities should also accept the proposal, otherwise it is tantamount to admitting that it is related to the recent attack on merchant ships. As for Italy, although Britain and France have not invited it to participate in the conference, Italian people have expressed their willingness to participate and denied being related to the attack on merchant ships. British officials believe that if Italy wants to participate in the conference, it should not be rejected. Moreover, if Italy participates in the conference and Germany remains out of the picture, the countries can take the opportunity to exert pressure on Italy to change its policies. As for Italy's proposal to hold the conference in a place other than Geneva, the countries concerned have not yet made a decision. (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding France's proposal to convene a conference on the Mediterranean issue in Geneva, although the Italian government has not yet expressed its attitude, it is believed that if Italy is invited and it is decided that the conference will be held outside the League of Nations framework, it will definitely send representatives to participate. Italy strongly refutes that submarines of unknown nationality belong to Italy, but avoids attacking the British view. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] According to news received here from Athens, the Greek government has submitted a note stating its willingness to participate in the Mediterranean Conference. At the same time, the Turkish government has also expressed its agreement to participate. (3rd, Guomin Hai Telegram)</p>
<p>[Moscow] After Soviet ships were repeatedly attacked by submarines in the Mediterranean, factories and army and navy units held meetings one after another, passing resolutions and publishing them in newspapers. The resolutions demanded that "strong measures be taken to punish the shameless and despicable provocations of fascist pirates." Most Soviet navy soldiers volunteered to stay in service after their military service expired. Black Sea Fleet officers declared that preparations have been completed and that as soon as they receive orders from the government, they will destroy the enemies of the motherland. Workers in Leuyuk City issued a declaration, saying, "We have reached the end of our patience. Fascism is infinitely harmful to modern mankind and must be destroyed to prevent the spread of the disaster." (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Navy officials recently stated that after ships of various countries in the Mediterranean were repeatedly attacked, the U.S. fleet stationed in Europe is now in a "state of alert." Although the U.S. maintains neutrality on European affairs and is not concerned, the U.S. naval fleet is allowed to open fire in self-defense. (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] A Navy Department spokesman announced today that the captains of the ships of the U.S. Navy's European Squadron are prepared to open fire in return if they are attacked by strange submarines or other ships in the Mediterranean. However, the U.S. is a "neutral country with no relationship" and does not want to be involved in such incidents. U.S. ships in the Mediterranean, unless they have special missions, have been ordered to remain in port. (4th, Central News Agency, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Britain today dispatched the Tenth Destroyer Flotilla to the Mediterranean. At the same time, France is also increasing its naval strength in the Mediterranean to jointly protect the safety of merchant ships. (3rd, Guomin Telegram)</p>

<h3>Temporary Measures for the Preparation of School Opening in Primary and Secondary Schools in This City</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Issued a Notice Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday instructed the primary and secondary schools in this city, saying that since the outbreak of the war in this city, all schools that have fallen into the war zone or are close to the war zone have been suspended for a time. Others have also been affected by the war, and some have not yet started school. In order to maintain the students' studies, schools in the war zone should try to relocate and start school within a possible scope, or merge with other schools to open. Those non-war zone schools that have not started classes should also prepare to start school. The bureau has now formulated the "Temporary Measures for the Preparation of School Opening in Primary and Secondary Schools in Shanghai" and the "Teaching Subjects and Teaching Hours Table for Secondary and Normal Schools in Shanghai," which are promulgated for implementation. In addition to submitting them to the Ministry of Education and the Municipal Government, the relevant measures and other orders are hereby copied to the primary and secondary schools for compliance. This order.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Primary and Secondary Schools Prepare</h3>
<p>Temporary Measures for School Opening</p>
<p>㊀ Non-war zone schools: In addition to the school buildings that are opening on their own, they should make every effort to vacate houses and lend them to other schools to open, or merge with other schools to open. ㊁ The subjects and hours taught in secondary and normal schools this semester shall be handled in accordance with the newly revised "Teaching Subjects and Teaching Hours Table for Secondary and Normal Schools in Shanghai" by the Bureau. The teaching subjects and teaching hours of vocational subjects shall be determined by each school with reference to the newly revised teaching hours of secondary and normal schools. Primary schools adopt a two-part system to teach, so that more students can be admitted. ㊂ New and old students in each school should not be boarding as a principle. ㊃ Student tuition fees shall be collected at most according to the original amount and shall not be increased, and shall comply with Item 6 of the "Temporary Measures for Handling School Affairs at All Levels" promulgated by the Ministry, and collect them in two installments as much as possible. Other physical education fees, experiment fees, material fees, and all miscellaneous fees should not be charged as a principle. Meal fees are also allowed to be paid monthly. The uniform fee for new students this semester may be temporarily exempted. ㊄ The salaries of school teachers and staff, office expenses, or rent, etc., should be planned and allocated by the principal or board of directors from the income of each item. ㊅ In addition to regular teaching, each school should add wartime knowledge. Secondary schools must also guide students to participate in war service. ㊆ The method of borrowing from each school will be determined separately.</p>
<p>Teaching Subjects and Teaching Hours Table for Wartime Secondary and Normal Schools in Shanghai</p>
<p>㊀ General Instructions: 1. This table is only applicable to the period of the War of Resistance. 2. This table is revised from the teaching subjects of secondary and normal schools promulgated by the Ministry of Education and the teaching hours table for each subject per week in each semester to meet the actual needs of wartime. 3. Each school at all levels shall have four hours of classes every day, and no holidays on Sundays, for a total of 28 hours of classes per week. 4. The principle of concentrating implementation is adopted for class affairs at all levels. Each school must provide each classroom for two or three levels of students to take classes every day (divided into three class sessions: 8:00 to 12:00, 1:00 to 5:00, and 6:00 to 10:00). 5. Except for normal schools, which offer a one-hour lecture on physical education theory from the second semester of the second year, the remaining physical education classes are taught outside of the prescribed class time (secondary schools: two hours; normal schools: two hours in the first year and the first semester of the second year; the rest is one hour). 6. Military training, three hours each for senior high school grades and first-year normal schools, is also temporarily scheduled to be taught outside of classroom time. 7. Civics is taught during the Prime Minister's Memorial Week, and the teaching materials must focus on spiritual training, current affairs, international relations, wartime economy, and mass organization and training. 8. Regarding wartime knowledge, in addition to specially set up subjects, other subjects should also supplement as much as possible according to their similar nature. For example, hygiene teaching materials should add wartime medical and pharmaceutical knowledge, methods for preventing the spread of germs, and chemical teaching materials should add poison gas research. Historical teaching materials should add the diplomatic history of our country in the past 100 years, the history of the Chinese nation's outward development and resistance to foreign forces. Geographical teaching materials should add national defense construction, Japanese military preparations, and comparison of resources in the Sino-Japanese War. 9. Senior high schools and normal schools will temporarily suspend grouping and elective methods. 10. Student experiments in biology, chemistry, and physics will be held outside of the prescribed teaching time. 11. The practice of normal schools will be temporarily concentrated in the second semester of the third year. 12. The number of hours students spend on self-study and extracurricular activities at school shall be determined by each school according to the actual situation. 13. If there is no need to change the curriculum of each subject in practice, the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education shall still be followed. 14. For each wartime knowledge subject, each school should compile its own teaching material outline for implementation based on the key points of its attention. The key points to be noted for each subject are as follows: A. Air defense and gas defense must pay attention to light control, alarm signals, traffic control, refuge system, poison gas defense, poisoning emergency treatment, and disinfection work. B. Battlefield first aid, applied to boys, must pay attention to first aid, stretcher transportation, burial, and public health. C. Military nursing, applied to girls, must pay attention to visual diagnosis, massage, bandage usage, food cooking, and ward hygiene. D. Wartime service must pay attention to propaganda, consolation, fundraising, fire prevention, security, food management, vehicle driving, telecommunications, and battlefield engineering. 15. Music teaching materials should mainly select national salvation songs that can inspire the spirit of resistance. (Table omitted)</p>
<h3>Common Sense for Citizens: Methods for Breaking Through Electric Fences</h3>
<p>Avoid Contact, Do Not Use Ironware; Current Disappears When Wires Touch the Ground</p>
<p>The Technical Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association has specially invited experts to study the method of breaking through electric fences, as it has been found that some soldiers at the front have died from touching electric fences. The following is a special excerpt, which is also common sense that citizens must know.</p>
<p>When encountering an electric fence, there is no need to panic, but you must not be careless. You must not allow any part of your body to come into contact with it, and you must not use weapons, ironware, or other electricity-conducting objects to strike it, so as to avoid electric shock. You must use the following method to break through it.</p>
<p>(A) Complete Destruction Method</p>
<p>(Explanation) Completely destroy or eliminate the electric fence at its root. (Method) ㊀ Drive a tank towards the electric fence and crush it. This is the most reliable method. ㊁ Use grenades or mortars to bomb the base of the electric fence frame. As long as the electric fence frame is destroyed and the wires touch the ground, the electric fence will lose its effectiveness.</p>
<p>(B) Cutting off the Current Method</p>
<p>(Explanation) Electric fences are most afraid of the wires touching the ground. If any method can be used to make one or two wires fall to the ground, the current in that section of the electric fence will immediately disappear.</p>
<p>(Method) ㊀ Use a long-handled axe or non-conductive objects, such as dry wooden sticks, wooden boards, bamboo sticks, etc., to strike the electric fence heavily and destroy it (weapons and ironware, which conduct electricity, must not be used). Be sure to make the wires on the electric fence break and fall to the ground. ㊁ Take copper wires, iron wires, or chains, tie iron balls or other ironware to both ends, and throw them on the electric fence from a distance. Be sure to make one part of the copper wires, iron wires, or chains hang on the electric fence and another part touch the ground. This will make the current on the electric fence pass to the ground and disappear.</p>
<p>(C) Method of Avoiding Electric Shock</p>
<p>(Explanation) Use non-conductive objects to cover the electric fence, so that the body will not be electrocuted when crossing the electric fence.</p>
<p>(Method) Pile non-conductive objects, such as dry blankets, on the electric fence, and then cover them with dry wooden boards, so you can cross over. Be careful not to touch the wires.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>㊀ When encountering barbed wire or the like, if you do not know if it is electrified, you can use method ㊁ of (B) to test it. If it is an electric fence, there must be sparks on the wires of the electric fence when copper wires, iron wires, chains, etc. are thrown on it. ㊁ If someone has been electrocuted on the electric fence, people behind must not touch them with their hands, feet, or weapons. You must first use the above method to break through the electric fence to avoid electric shock.</p>
<h3>United Christian Association's Extraordinary Service</h3>
<p>Set Up Ten Shelters, Accommodating 4,000 Refugees</p>

<h3>Gas Company Resumes Gas Supply</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Shanghai Gas Company of the Public Concession suspended the supply of gas to avoid danger. The company has now decided to resume gas supply from tomorrow (Monday) due to the outward expansion of the war. All prices will remain the same as before and will not be increased. Therefore, those in general industry who need gas will resume work at that time.</p>
<h3>Commander Yang's Wife Sponsors Wounded Soldiers' Hospital</h3>
<p>Madam Tian Shujun, wife of Commander Yang Xiaoduan, has spared no effort in national salvation work since she presided over the Chinese Women's Mutual Aid Association. In addition to handling refugee shelters and consoling wounded soldiers, she is now raising huge sums of money to sponsor the Fourteenth Relief Hospital, which is located on Jules Dutilh Road. The medical and various equipment are extremely complete, and all management is military, scientific, and modern. Each ward is equipped with a radio, and there are short current affairs reports every day, and leading figures and celebrities in Shanghai are invited to give national salvation speeches to encourage morale and provide spiritual training. A three-day war report is published every three days, and the Women's Mutual Aid Association organizes a choir to sing anti-Japanese songs to regulate the life of illness, so that after recovery, they can go to the front line to fight with even more enthusiasm. The hospital will open soon and is expected to be the first scientifically designed relief hospital at sea.</p>
<h3>Refugees in Pudong Urgently Need Relief</h3>
<p>Most are from Hubei and Jiangbei; Hope Local Associations Will Pay Attention</p>
<p>Since the Hong Yang period, Pudong has not been affected by war for eighty or ninety years. The 1.28 Incident also did not affect it. Therefore, after the outbreak of this war, people from all war zones with money moved to the concession area, which is generally recognized as the safest area. Those who could not afford to live in the concession area moved to the edge of Pudong one after another. Unexpectedly, there were also occasional wars in that area, so they had to move further inland. As a result, the population in the central area of Pudong has soared, and because of traffic blockages and inconvenient transportation, prices have soared even more than in Shanghai. These people are neither wealthy nor have they suffered the hardship of several relocations, and their lives are becoming increasingly painful. It is hoped that general refugees will seek relief or repatriation from various charities. According to the survey, most of the refugees are from Hubei and Jiangbei, so it is hoped that local associations will pay special attention.</p>
<h3>The Front and Rear Urgently Need Winter Supplies</h3>
<p>Monk Relief Team Aids Various Vehicles</p>
<p>The weather in this city has been hot and sunny during the day and cold at night in recent days, so citizens are very prone to illness. Soldiers at the front and refugees in shelters have also been affected by the cold at night and urgently need donations of quilts, padded clothes, and other winter supplies to meet their urgent needs.</p>
<p>The Monk Relief Team organized by the Relief Committee of the Shanghai Charity Organization United Relief Disaster Association is headed by Qu Yingguang, chairman of the association. The most difficult problem for the team at present is vehicles, because there are only four ambulances prepared, and now the war zone is expanding day by day, and it takes time to travel back and forth, which makes it even more insufficient. Therefore, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will generously donate or lend trucks, cars, motorcycles, etc., so that the team can provide universal relief.</p>
<h3>Swire Chinese Employees Donate Salaries</h3>
<p>Zheng Zhenfu and 21 Others</p>
<p>Zheng Zhenfu and 21 other employees of the Shengjing Wheel Management Department of Swire Company decided to deduct one-tenth of their monthly salaries to help the government fight the enemy for a long time until the final victory and the end of the war. Yesterday, the first month raised 91.1 yuan, which was handed over to this newspaper for transfer to the government.</p>
<h3>Yesong Factory Declares Forced Seizure of Crane</h3>
<p>The Chinese-language newspaper Shen Bao reported that there were rumors outside that a flat-bottomed crane from the Yesong Shipyard had been leased to the Japanese army for loading and unloading heavy weapons carried by Japanese ships. Yesterday night, a staff member of the factory declared that the crane was forcibly taken away by the Japanese army without the permission of the factory personnel. The factory asked the Japanese authorities to return the machine. The machine was used by the Japanese army within the limits of the ship port and has not been moved elsewhere. It has been idle in the river near the Osaka Mercantile Steamship Co. pier for several days.</p>
<h3>French Envoy Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>

<p>French Ambassador to China, Mr. Naggiar, came from the Beidaihe summer resort, passing through Jinan and Qingdao to the south, and took a gunboat that was sent to meet him in Qingdao on the third day to Shanghai. He arrived at the port at 8:30 yesterday morning and landed on the Bund of the French Concession.

<h3>French Concession Authority Issues Notice Prohibiting Assemblies and Associations</h3>
<p>Responsible for Protecting the Safety of Residents; Those Who Assemble Without Authorization Will Be Expelled</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, the French Concession Authority has issued a night curfew to maintain the safety of residents and merchants in the concession, and has issued a notice stating that people in the concession must not assemble or form associations. The French authorities have now found that some people in the concession are still holding meetings without authorization in violation of regulations, and on the 2nd, they issued two more notices, which are copied as follows:</p>

Therefore, the French authorities will no longer continue to protect those who disturb the peace by taking advantage of the protection of the French authorities and will expel them from the concession. Commissioner of Police of the Shanghai French Concession.</p>
<h3>Concession Authorities Rush to Repair Traffic Lights at the Great World</h3>
<p>The red and green traffic lights in front of the Great World, which manage the traffic of vehicles, were destroyed by a bomb on the 14th of last month. The police station in charge sent police to temporarily direct the traffic of vehicles. Now, the concession authorities, in view of the important location and the large number of vehicles, have sent staff to rush to repair them and connect the broken wires. It is expected that they will be restored and opened tomorrow. In addition, the Sino-Western Pharmacy Great World Branch in the southwest corner of the area will resume normal business starting today.</p>

<h3>Fifteen Enemy Planes Bomb Shanghai's West Side, Hundreds of Innocent Civilians Killed and Wounded</h3>
<p>Night-Long Shelling Extremely Fierce; Our Air Force Dispatches Planes to Attack Enemy Aircraft at Night; Enemy Troops Land in Large Numbers in Wusong</p>
<p>Enemy troops landing to reinforce their forces have been surrounded and fiercely attacked by our army for days, suffering heavy casualties and completely losing their morale. On the one hand, they urgently telegraphed for help, and at the same time, they made every effort to use heavy artillery and aircraft to harass our positions day and night, interspersed with small-team assaults. When our army jumped out of the trenches to chase them, they quickly retreated. Most of the enemy troops were deeply entrenched and did not come out, relying on their solid defensive works to hold out for reinforcements. Last night, on the line from Jiangwan to Wusong, fierce shelling continued all night. A large number of enemy aircraft were also active everywhere, dropping bombs aimlessly, attempting to destroy our army's positions. Our army was well aware of their tricks and retaliated with heavy artillery across the entire line. Our air force dispatched planes at the same time to drive away the enemy aircraft. For a time, the sound of machine guns in the air was grinding, and the battle was fierce. After dawn, the sound of artillery gradually subsided. The enemy in Wusong, who were holding out, took the opportunity to launch an assault, but were quickly repelled by our army. The remnants of the enemy trapped in Luodian also used heavy artillery to bomb our positions. The sound of artillery was even more fierce this morning and has not stopped until noon. Our army calmly counterattacked, and the positions did not change. Also, at 7:30 this morning, fifteen enemy aircraft randomly dropped heavy bombs in Xinjing, Zhoujiaqiao, Zhongshan Road, and other places in northwest Shanghai. The rumbling sound was incessant. More than 300 innocent civilians were killed and wounded. This kind of brutal behavior by Japanese aircraft is a challenge to all mankind.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After the enemy troops retreated in defeat, they asked Tokyo for help again. Yesterday, a large number of enemy ships, totaling more than 40, composed of a mixture of merchant ships and transport ships, gathered outside the mouth of Wusong. It is estimated that two divisions of reinforcements have been transported. Last night and this morning, most of the reinforcements have landed in Wusong. It is said that the order for a general attack across the entire line will be issued within a few days in an attempt to break out of the encirclement. Our army is waiting in strict formation and will give them a head-on blow at that time.</p>
<h3>Bloody Hand-to-Hand Combat at Wusong</h3>
<p>Frontline Infantry Units Mixed Together in a Fierce Struggle; Our Forces Victorious</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The enemy, after being pressed by our forces, retreated to the Wusong Riverbank and launched several extremely fierce counterattacks last night, assaulting our positions and attempting to invade Baoshan and Yuepu. Enemy warships in the river bombarded our positions with concentrated fire to cover the advance of their infantry. Our rear artillery units immediately returned fire, resulting in not only bloody hand-to-hand combat between the frontline infantry units of both sides, mixed together in a fierce struggle, but also an unprecedented artillery battle between the artillery units of both sides. Simultaneously, aircraft were active in the air, with fireballs flying and enemy aircraft illuminating the night sky with flares. After dawn this morning, the sound of artillery gradually subsided, and the enemy was finally forced to retreat. At noon today, the artillery battle between the two sides resumed and has not ceased.</p>
<p>The enemy, entirely surrounded at Luodian, also launched several counterattacks last night. The booming of artillery resounded throughout the night, but they remain within our encirclement.</p>
<h3>Enemy Reinforcements Gather Outside Wusong Estuary</h3>
<p>Transport Ships Carry Large Numbers of Horses</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The enemy forces fighting in Shanghai have successively deployed three reinforcement divisions. In recent days, they have been severely attacked by our forces in Luodian, Wusong, and Liuhe, suffering countless casualties. Those who invaded Luodian are even more completely surrounded by our forces. The enemy side has again telegraphed Tokyo, requesting the dispatch of two additional reinforcement divisions. This batch of reinforcements has now departed from that country for Shanghai on over forty transport ships and warships and has successively arrived in the Sanjiaoshui area outside the Wusong Estuary, choosing locations to anchor. Every two or three transport ships are constantly protected by a warship. This batch of reinforcements is currently devising methods outside Wusong to find a suitable location to advance. According to a certain ship crew member who arrived recently, he saw that several transport ships were also carrying a large number of horses, presumably for the enemy's cavalry or for towing artillery. The situation outside the Wusong Estuary is again becoming tense. Therefore, foreign merchant ships are not entering the port today either.</p>
<p>There have been no major changes in the enemy warships on the Huangpu River this morning. Since the Consuls-General of Britain, the United States, and France requested the Japanese side to move their warships downstream to below the China Merchants Bureau's North Bund, the Japanese side appears not to have complied yet. The Japanese flagship Izumo is still anchored at No. 2 River Pier, while the two destroyers of the 23rd Squadron at the Mitsubishi Wharf remain berthed, but have turned their bows eastward. The situation of other stationed warships in the Yangshupu Huishan Wharf area remains as before.</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of Enemy Aircraft Atrocities</h3>
<p>Beixinjing and Zhoujiaqiao Bombed; Over Three Hundred Civilians Killed and Wounded; Bombing Still in Progress as of 3 PM</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The atrocities of Japanese aircraft continue unabated. After an enemy aircraft was shot down yesterday by our defending forces on Zhongshan Road, the enemy aircraft, with their ambitions undeterred, urgently sought revenge. At 7 AM this morning, the booming sound of bombing shook the entire city. The tranquil atmosphere of Western Shanghai was instantly shattered. Fifteen enemy aircraft carried out extensive bombing in the area west of Zhaofeng Park and north of Bailinan Road in Beixinjing. The dead and wounded were all innocent civilians, with Zhoujiaqiao, Chenjiadu, and Beixinjing Town suffering the most severe damage. According to current statistics, the dead and wounded in the two locations number approximately sixty to seventy dead and over three hundred wounded. Such cruel acts of bombing innocent civilians will be even more condemned by the world.</p>
<p>Zhoujiaqiao</p>
<p>Enemy aircraft, divided into two large groups, appeared in the Zhoujiaqiao Chenjiadu area, totaling nine aircraft. They dropped over ten bombs, killing and wounding over twenty civilians and injuring over one hundred. After rescue teams rushed to provide aid, some of the injured were sent to Renji Hospital, while others were sent to the Red Cross Hospital. Factories in the Zhoujiaqiao area that were damaged include the Far East Wood Factory, Shengchang Stone Powder Factory, and others. Other locations are still under investigation. During the bombing, villagers fled in all directions, rushing towards the Zhaofeng Park concession area. Half an hour later, the enemy aircraft departed, only to drop bombs again on other nearby villages and fields, circling around until noon.</p>
<p>Beixinjing</p>
<p>This newspaper's reporter drove to Beixinjing and Zhoujiaqiao around noon today to inspect the situation. However, upon reaching the western end of Bailinan Road, he was strongly prevented from proceeding by the police on duty there, who pointed to the sky and said that six enemy aircraft were still continuing to bomb various locations in the area. Even rescue workers from various charitable organizations were unable to go and provide aid. Helpless, the reporter had to stop there temporarily. However, he saw a continuous stream of refugees fleeing, carrying corpses and wounded, clogging the road. The heartbreaking and tragic scene was unbearable to witness. The reporter then met Mr. Lu, an employee of the Pushan Villa burial team, who reported that after receiving reports of many deaths and injuries from enemy aircraft bombing in Zhoujiaqiao and Beixinjing, he immediately led his team to Zhoujiaqiao to provide aid. Upon arriving, he saw corpses and wounded piled up everywhere. The tragic state was equal to that of the South Station, and all were impoverished refugees. The most deaths and injuries occurred in a disused lime kiln. The refugees, upon seeing a large formation of enemy aircraft approaching, all fled into the kiln, causing the enemy aircraft's target to be concentrated there, intensifying the bombing and strafing. Nearby thatched houses were bombed and destroyed, falling into the creek. At that time, approximately thirty corpses were collected by our team, not including the wounded. Unexpectedly, they were unable to proceed on their second rescue attempt, as six enemy aircraft were still continuing to bomb various locations in the area. As a result, over one hundred dead and wounded in the Beixinjing area could not be rescued. The inhumane actions of the enemy aircraft are truly intolerable to the world. As of this newspaper's deadline, 3 PM, the enemy aircraft were still continuing their rampage.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Enemy Troops Land in Eastern Shanghai</h3>
<p>Possible Plans in the Yangshupu Area; A Large-Scale Offensive Appears Imminent</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After the enemy's general offensive on the Wusong front failed, they have been retreating to regroup and await reinforcements. According to news from foreigners in the Hongkou district, large numbers of Japanese troops have been gathering in the Yangshupu area for the past two days. Reinforcements landing from the Dalian Mail Steamer Company Wharf in Yangshupu surged like a tide. In addition to infantry, many tanks and heavy artillery were also unloaded. The number of aircraft transported ashore for assembly was also very large. According to observations from foreigners, the enemy appears to have plans in the Yangshupu area. It is feared that once the landed reinforcements are fully distributed, the enemy in the Yangshupu area will begin a large-scale offensive.</p>
<p>After the enemy invasion of Shanghai suffered a severe blow from our forces, they reinforced with three divisions to China, attempting to land in Wusong, Liuhe, and Baoshan, repeating the old trick of the January 28th Incident, attempting to attack our rear. After our forces bravely resisted, they have already surrounded the remaining enemy, leaving them no room to develop. They have now again requested assistance from Tokyo, adding two more divisions to Shanghai, which arrived at the Song Estuary yesterday. A portion of them, on five enemy transport ships, sailed into the Huangpu River yesterday afternoon and night, mooring near the Huangpu Wharf, seemingly intending to reinforce the besieged enemy forces in Hongkou. As for the remaining troops, their decision on where to land is limited and undetermined. The five ships that entered the port returned to the outer port this morning, seemingly having completed their mission.</p>
<h3>Fierce Night Battle at Qimei Road Intersection</h3>
<p>Enemy Incessantly Firing Guns and Feeling Their Way Forward; We Encircle from Three Sides, Killing Fifty Enemies</p>
<p>There had been no major contact in the Qimei Road area for several days. At around 9 PM last night, the enemy suddenly opened fire from the intersection of Dixiwei Road with hundreds of shots. Our forces disregarded this as a common tactic of the enemy. After a while, another thirty to forty enemies stealthily felt their way forward, approaching to within about 100 meters. Our forces took a three-sided encirclement formation, and in one fell swoop, slaughtered the enemies, leaving none behind. Unexpectedly, another hundred or so enemy troops chased after them, firing machine guns wildly with intense firepower. Our side also returned fire with machine guns. After fifteen minutes, the enemy retreated on their own.</p>
<p>At around 9 PM last night, about three hundred enemy troops suddenly invaded our positions in the Baziqiao area of Jiangwan Road, firing continuously with rifles and machine guns. Our forces remained silent. After about twenty minutes, they approached our positions closer and closer. At the sound of a bugle, they jumped out of the trenches, aiming at their targets and densely firing and throwing hand grenades and machine guns. The enemy fell to the ground in response. Our forces immediately charged forward. The enemy did not show weakness, and reinforcements arrived. Our forces fought bravely with a hundredfold effort, one against ten, engaging in a melee for an hour and a half. The enemy then collapsed and retreated, with only about a hundred survivors.</p>
<h3>Confirmation of Enemy Aircraft Burned and Shot Down</h3>
<p>Our Military Authorities Confirm This Morning; Remains of Two Pilots Recovered, Names Identified</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Regarding the enemy bomber that dropped bombs in our rear areas along Hengfeng Road, Gonghe Road, and Zhongshan Road in Zhabei at 12:15 PM yesterday and crashed and burned in a vacant field on Zhongshan Road, it was confirmed by our military authorities this morning that the enemy aircraft was indeed hit in its fuel tank by the anti-aircraft unit of our □□□ Division, crashing and burning on the spot. Afterwards, the remains of the aircraft body were recovered with inscriptions such as "Showa 10th Year Nagoya Made" and "No. 48". Furthermore, two symbols were recovered on the remains of the two pilots found nearby, one named "Yamamoto Yu" and one named "Kaneko Sadaichi". Today's North China Daily News also stated that according to eyewitnesses on the scene, the enemy aircraft was indeed shot down by our anti-aircraft unit.</p>
<h3>Tranquility in Pudong This Morning</h3>
<p>Most Shops Have Opened for Business; Our Military Positions Completely Undamaged</p>
<p>After the failure of the Japanese military's attempt to invade Pudong, the fighting has subsided, and the towns along the Pudong coast have returned to a state of calm. Tangqiao Town, which controls the important transportation route to Shangnan, had several artillery shells fall on it during the fierce artillery battle the day before, but only a very small number of civilian houses were bombed and destroyed. This morning, half of the shops on the streets have opened their doors for business, especially vegetable vendors. There were already quite a few people crowding the streets to buy vegetables. The civilian ferry across the river from Dongjiadu is also operating as usual, and the fares charged are the same as usual. Laobaidu Town and Yangjiadu Town were not affected in any way before the battle. However, because most of the residents have left, they appear quite desolate. There are still many vegetable vendors along the streets, but there are fewer customers. The Laiyidu area, which is usually the most bustling, was subjected to more artillery fire on the afternoon of the third day. Therefore, some city houses either had their roofs destroyed or their walls collapsed. There are very few residents remaining. The shops are still open for business in the morning to maintain the livelihoods of those who remain, but being in their midst is unusually quiet. To the north of Sanwanchang is a restricted area, and pedestrians are prohibited from passing through, and can only detour through the back streets. Therefore, it was impossible to see the scene after the fire at the Chunjiang Wharf. Qichang Station is closely connected to the Japanese warships in Pudong, and the residents have all moved out, which is not worth mentioning. Further east is Yangjing Town, which suffered the most damage after the Shanghai war began, because the nearby Shiba Jiantou has always been a place where bandits are harbored. This time, the bandits acted as accomplices, so Japanese aircraft went to drop bombs every day for the past few days, estimating no less than one hundred bombs, resulting in a field of rubble. These bandits then wantonly looted, but the residents had already carried away their valuables. The bandits wanted bulky furniture, beds, tables and chairs. It is said that these people cannot move the looted wooden objects to Puxi or elsewhere, so they try to hide them, so that after the situation calms down, they will resell them. These mad and outrageous bandits deserve to be killed. The above is what the reporter obtained when he observed the post-war situation in various towns by car this morning.</p>
<h3>Japanese People Are Tired of War</h3>
<p>Resent Government's Invasion of China</p>
<p>[Tianjin] According to a foreigner who recently arrived in Tianjin from Japan, the Japanese government deceives the public with false victory news every day in order to stimulate people's emotions. However, Japanese people are dissatisfied with their government's military actions in China, and people's hearts are very uneasy. Factories and shops in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, and other places are mostly closed. Slogans opposing the warlords' invasion of China are everywhere. Whenever Japanese troops are sent to China as reinforcements, the families of the soldiers all support the old and carry the young to see them off, and the crying is deafening. This is enough to prove that the Japanese people resent the government and do not like war. (Fast News Agency Telegram, 5th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Reporter Talks About the Spirit of Resistance of Our Army in North China</h3>
<p>Officers and Soldiers of the 29th Army Resolved to Kill the Enemy; Guerrilla Units and Civilians Extremely Active</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A certain foreign reporter stationed in Tianjin, immediately walked south after the Tianjin Incident, passing through Yangliuqing, Jinghai, Chen Guantun, and Xiaowangzhuang, Chaozongqiao, Yangzha, and other places east of the Jinpu Line, investigating the actual situation of the war on the front line. After more than two weeks, he finally left Jinan and came south. Arriving in Beijing on the morning of the 4th, according to a certain gentleman, he had lived and eaten with our soldiers on the front line for two days and nights. Afterwards, he met with our military officers in various places and had a deep impression of the dynamics of the soldiers on the front line because he could speak Chinese. Our soldiers can retaliate fiercely against the enemy's invasion with the highest enthusiasm. Especially the soldiers of the 29th Army, who have been dormant for four years, are particularly excited. Although they have had no food or accommodation for 25 days since the Tianjin Incident, and the mud after the rain has reached their thighs, they still want to encourage their remaining bravery against the reinforcements and are unwilling to change defenses. They all have the determination to smash the enemy and destroy them. He also said that Jinghai County has been lost and regained by our army many times. Every time they retreat, they maintain good order. After reaching a certain location and meeting with the reinforcements, they immediately counterattack. It can be seen at a glance that this is determined according to military strategy. In addition, our guerrilla units often go out to attack the enemy, either encircling them or attacking their rear. They have repeatedly approached the Tianjin West Station. The Tianjin Japanese Alliance always says that the guerrilla units attacking Tianjin have been defeated. In fact, the mission of these guerrilla units is not to occupy any place. Once they have achieved the purpose of destruction and threat, they return safely and quickly. When talking about the bravery and composure of our officers and soldiers, a certain gentleman recounted his conversation with our artillery officer in a car on the front line. At that time, artillery shells were flying outside the car, and the car was shaken by the impact of the shells. His ears were deaf, but the officer had no fear at all. He talked calmly about his combat experience, which made me suspect that his nerves were made of iron rather than flesh. The people in the front are also calm as usual. Recently, because the farming work is not busy, many people go to the front and rear to help the troops transport and dig trenches. The authorities pay them two cents of wages per day, but most farmers refuse to accept it or ask to donate the money to war expenses. Even though I am an outsider, after seeing this scene, I could not help but shed tears of gratitude. (Central News Agency Telegram, 5th)</p>

<h3>Short Commentary</h3>
<p>— Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota recently hosted foreign reporters at his official residence and made a statement, saying, "Japan's use of force against China is for the purpose of maintaining vested interests and establishing lasting peace in East Asia." These two statements are incomprehensible. ㊀ To maintain vested interests, it is necessary to use force against China. However, Britain, France, the United States, and other countries also have considerable vested interests in China. Why don't they use force? Do they not maintain their vested interests? Also, to maintain vested interests, it is necessary to use force. If one wants to invade non-vested interests, what method should be used? ㊁ To establish East Asian peace, it is necessary to use force against China. Is it necessary to go to war to achieve peace? Conversely, is it necessary to have peace to go to war? What is the meaning of this? Furthermore, after going to war, can one achieve lasting peace in East Asia? I am afraid that Mr. Hirota is not necessarily sure of this.</p>
