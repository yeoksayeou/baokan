<h3>我軍變換新陣地軍部發言人談話</h3>
<p>為達成持久戰之目的</p>
<p>中央社南京二十七日電、軍政部發言人、二十七日對上海我軍變換新陣綫發表談話如卞、我軍陣地自九一三移至江灣蕰藻浜之綫又達四旬有餘、敵軍以大砲飛機日夜向我陣地轟炸、敵我在此陣綫前後爭奪戰、不下數十决、我軍屢作壯烈之犧牲、敵人傷亡之巨、亦為從來所未有、外國軍事觀察家評判、敵軍已失去共第一等陸軍强國之地位、是我對敵軍在此陣綫消耗戰之目的．已完全逹到、且鑒於江灣大場一帶陣地．過於突出、而原有野戰工事、已為敵人猛烈砲火所摧毀、乃依作戰上之需要、並為達成持入戰之目的、及整理戰綫、减少損害起見、於二十六日晚、將江灣鎮·大場·及其以西之新涇橋．白牆宅·一帶陣地、自動放棄、移守其後方之旣設陣地、現廣福·瀏河·一帶陣地、迄無變動、並為昨晚變換新陣綫之聯絡、更為確實鞏固計、彭浦及暨南新村一帶、仍由我軍固守、故此决我軍之移動、對於我抗戰到底之計劃、絕不致有何影響、</p>
<h3>小勝不驕小敗不餒我軍扼守新陣綫</h3>
<p>全綫卅餘公里防禦益臻鞏固　决本誓死抗戰精神與敵週旋</p>
<p>中央社云、軍息、昨晨我大場南翔間第一道防綫、被敵突破後、眞如無綫電台又告吃緊、大塲·廟行·江灣·開北四區、遂陷於四面包圍之中、我軍事當局鑒於困守該處、徒受重大犧牲、而長期抗戰、亦不在一時一地之得失、故為保持實力計、不得不於昨晨九時及晚十時分兩决作有秩序之撤退、扼守新陣綫、沿蘇州河至梵皇渡車站、再沿鐵路而至眞如南翔、我軍戰綫在二日之內、雖有急劇之變化、惟於上海戰局、絕無影響、前綫將士咸抱小勝不驕、小敗不餒﹂之精神、繼續奮鬥、而滬西南市兩處、則仍在我軍固守中、</p>
<p>全線防禦益臻鞏固</p>
<p>中央社云、軍息、我江灣閘北兩區駐軍、因戰略關係、於前夜向西南移撤、在京滬鐵路以南與蘇州河以北一帶、至昨晨四時半、已將新防綫佈遛就緒、全綫長達三十餘公里、由滬西中央造幣廠附近起、向西經眞如江橋兩鎭、轉西北至小南翔．折東北而至廣福、至施相公廟方面、亦向西移、退至登橋鎮而與瀏河成一垂直綫、全綫防禦、益臻鞏固、敵如來犯、决本誓死抗戰之精神．與敵週旋、</p>

<h3>閘北黑夜中火光燭天</h3>
<h3>國際電臺附近我軍激戰退敵</h3>
<p>敵軍被我擊斃千五百人</p>
<p>中央社眞如隨軍記者二十八日晨一時二十分報告、我軍新陣綫右翼、以彭浦為中心、西至暨南新村、東南至潭子灣、已趨穩定、進抵眞如國際無綫電臺之敵、昨晨起、沿桃浦企圖繼續南道、但在電臺南綠之許家橋及吳家庫後積港宅等處、被我大軍限截、發生激戰、進犯之敵、計有三聯隊之衆、並以坦克車十三輛前導、至下午二時、戰事更趨猛烈、我軍奮勇血搏、有進無退、激戰至四時許、敵軍死傷逹一千五百人之多我軍傷亡、亦達千人、經此惡戰、敵軍兇燄已殺、遂卽退去、按上述各處、離暨南新村約一公里許、距京滬鐵路約二公里、又彭浦至潭子灣之綫、我亦以生力軍扼守、敵於昨晨自中山路之東北端南犯、數度巷戰、被我擊斃三百餘人、至四時、戰事更為猛烈、迄報告時、仍在惡戰中、敵軍似以全力猛攻、惟迄未得逞、</p>
<h3>悲慘壯烈可歌可泣我孤軍誓死抗日</h3>
<p>為爭取我國家偉大之人格　寗酒最後一滴血不願生還</p>
<p>閘北我軍、雖已於昨晨拂曉前大部安全撤退、但此非謂閘北已全無我軍綜跡、蓋我八十八師一營以上之忠勇將士八百餘人、由團長謝靑元·營長楊瑞符·率領、尚在烈燄籠罩敵軍四圍中、以其最後一滴血與最後一顥彈、向敵軍索取應付之代價、正演出一幕驚天地泣鬼神可永垂靑史而不朽之壯烈劇戰也．此一營以上之忠勇將士、係奉令扼守要點、掩護大軍撤退者、當大軍安然退去後、本有充分時間、可以全部撤去、蓋我北站方面部隊、於昨晨四時許、卽已撤竣、而敵軍遲至六時許始推進也、惟此營忠勇將土、抱定犧牲之決心．寗酒最從一滴血、爭取我國家偉大之人格、發揚民族壯烈之精神、不願生還、當彼等離扼守之要點後、卽分少數士兵、各居新拉圾橋北堍各大厦中、而大部將士、则雄踞於橋西之四行儲蓄曾堆棧之七曆大厦中、彼等分居各樓、憑窗口固守、當時西藏路之租界內英駐軍、見彼等已陷於包圍之危境、激發人類之同情心、請彼等卸去武裝、向租界內通過、但我忠勇將士、堅决謝絕英軍好意、寗死不去、俄頃敵軍紛至沓來、但聞疎落之槍聲四起、敵軍紛紛應聲而倒、蓋彼等此時、對子彈之珍視、實遠較生命為甚、非瞄準决不敢射也、記者於昨日傍午、親至蘇州河南岸某處、視察對岸情形、目聲有敵兵三人、各執我平民二人、意氣揚揚、行經烏鎮路橋附近、突見我士兵一人躍出、將前行之二敵乓擊斃、另一敵兵、推去其手執之二人、持槍撲去、當被二人奮勇攔住、頃刻間亦為我軍聲斃、又見一敵兵潛伏高樓、正舉槍向我經過該地之士兵射擊、但另一大厦之我軍、已先發共準確之槍彈、將該敵軍盤倒、自正午起至三時止、敵軍乃大舉向四行儲蓄曾堆棧進撲、人如潮湧、擬奪門而入、此時我軍乃大發機關槍、拋至手溜彈、敵軍被擊斃者、逹六七十人之多、自此敵軍卽取包圍形勢、未敢輕進、記者目擊此種壯烈情形、不禁感泣、據記者探悉、困處大厦中之我忠勇將士、尚有充分之械彈、足資殺敵、但給養斷絕、實堪憂盧、下午六時許、謝團長。楊營長·曾發出壯烈之呼籲、請接濟糖鹽各五百磅、光餅五萬枚．則我全營忠男將土、可與敵死拚一週、死而無憾、</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、閘北有華兵若于、不願遵從退走命令、今日（二十七日）下午、處於四面火熖之中、退山之路、已為日軍截斷、故所處地位、至為危險、觀察家數人、謂此類華兵、共有四千人之衆、寗戰死閘北、而不願於敵軍攻擊之前退走、閘北有多處起火現信乃由日兵縱火、希圖迫令伏匿之華兵外山、防衛公共租界邊際之英高射砲手今日一日中、曾射華飛入其防區內之日飛機多决、內有數人、以發彈命中自豪、蓋日機數架、於英兵開槍後、曾作箥動之狀也、英兵深恐日兵繼續侵擾、故今日皆脫其外衣、汗流滿面、忙碌裝沙袋、以增固其防所、法租界西區邊界軍警、已作特別戒備但至今日正午止、尚未發生專端、聞並無華兵或難民希圖强入租界、日軍現續向眞如壓迫、故觀察家預料京滬鐵路中山路至眞如一段之華軍、將續向蘇州河南岸退走、今日上午二時、閘北有多處地雷矗發、蘇州河南岸區域皆覺震動、</p>
<p>華兵一小隊、今日（二十七日）正午、仍扼守西藏路橋正西蘇州路北岸之房屋數所、日兵謹愼由瓦礫堆中前進、希圖將若輩逐走、但遭遇猛烈之機關槍火、此輩華兵退路己斷、顯决戰死該地、日兵死者纍蓋隔岸可見日兵正在各街道拖其死傷之兵而走也、另有華兵若干、在閘北蘇州河瀆沙袋小掩蔽所後回擊日兵、日兵則由四面包圍、且在附近一大貨棧屋頂以機關槍射擊之、中外人在租界方面便利地點觀此壯烈戰鬥者、為數甚衆、雖經巡捕勸阻、衆皆不散且有外人携攝影機、希圖攝取日兵動作之影者、日兵在對岸举枪作欲擊势、於是攝影者皆驚駭而逃、現對岸唯見日兵而已、此輩華兵、或為敢死隊中人、或因見彼等同志、今晨未作抵抗者、皆為臼兵擊斃、故寗願與日兵一拚也、有外人曾目覩日兵强令就俘之華兵、自掘一穴堀華、卽開槍斃之、而以屍投入穴中、至遭逼此種命運者、共有若干、外人未一一目覩、故未能舉其數目、但據今晨情形觀之、閘北華兵之被俘者、必甚寡也、英兵營房對面今日曾建一席棚、而以有刺鐵絲繚其四週、以便收容繳械入租界之華兵、但目下入內者、寥寥無幾、另有數兵因退路已斷、泅水過河、已交與捕房收管、據西區英兵防所報告、今日侵晨、雖有巨數華兵經過英兵防綫、但未有圖人防區之行勸、受傷華兵多人、曾由英兵放人租界、以卡車較送醫院、英兵且援助此種人道主義之工作、外傳英兵與華兵發生衝突之說、毫無根據、</p>
<h3>滬英僑全撒說不確</h3>
<p>中央社倫敦二十七日哈瓦斯電、外傳上海方面英國當局命令現在上海公共租界內之英國僑民、一律撤退、此說頃由官方人士予以否認、並謂英國當局業已採取各項措置、以謀保護英國僑民之生命財產、</p>

<p>快訊社本埠廿七日訊、今晨七時半至十時半間、日機屢在凱旋路英軍防綫附返擲彈、並以機槍向下掃射、英軍曾五决以高射機槍向日機還擊於最後一决有日機一架中彈着火墮燬、據目覩者報告、日機之殘酷轟炸、今益變本加厲、今晨滬西一帶逃難平民、遭其炸斃、或以機槍擊斃者、當在五百名以上、聞英兵亦有四人受傷、（一說二人）</p>
<p>中央社云、本市英文大美晚報云、防守租界邊境之英兵、昨日（廿七日）曾數决向可機射擊、其中數兵堅稱、彼等曾擊中日機、綠當彼等射擊時、曾目睹日磯在空中動搖云、英兵昨日在各防禦地點、堆撤沙包以資鞏固與防衛、云、又據外國觀察家報告、昨晨七時四十五分防守沿白利南路租界邊境之英兵、因日機襲擊英兵防地及其附近、曾五决以機槍向日機射擊、日機於英乓開槍後、卽倉皇這去云、</p>

<h3>火綫中之採訪工作（續）</h3>
<p>西站員工態度鎮靜　鐵糞車權充坦克車</p>
<p>因為我軍右翼閘北·江灒·廟行·以迄大塲一綫的移動、不得不使人注意到滬西、記者昨午十二時許、偕同同事金·張二君、驅車直達越界築路極司非而路西端之鐵路橋口、鐵路之西、就是直通北新涇的大道、路東有英國陸軍及捕房探捕多名駐守、記者到達該處時、祇見大批難民肩箱負篋、扶老携幼、自蘇州河北向鐵路橋逃奔南來、厥狀之慘、的是一幅流亡載道圖、而當時最令人感佩者、卽駐守該處之英國陸軍、對於所有的難民、均竭力加以護救、其中尤以第一二二二號華捕、與一搜長之英國軍士、及一身着便衣的大塊頭、往返於四十餘米的鐵路橋上、背負婦孺老弱、而達橋南、覓達百餘次之多、此種偉大精神、幾使人感奮而至流淚、記者詢其姓氏、知華捕名嚴秉衡、便衣大漢、乃捕房探員王金聲也、其時敵機翱翔於滬西及河北一帶上空者、約達四十餘架之多、偵察投彈、恣意橫行、</p>
<p>至午後一時二十分、距離橋北約三百餘米之鐵路附近、忽起密集之機關槍及迫擊砲聲、蓋敵人之追擊部隊、已與我軍發生接觸矣此時記者以身處南岸、而槍跑聲來自河北、火綫必在鐵路綫附近之東西兩方對峙、除流彈以外、諒無他虞、故未忍遽去、乃急奔至梵王渡車站、假電話向本館報告、當時該站站長及員工等、均態度鎮靜、照常工作、而同時敵機五架、已飛臨該站上空、站長指謂記者日、此處乃敵機注意目標、君何不懼危險乎、記者答曰、君等終日居此、獨無危險乎、站長曰、余等職責所任、不容擅離耳、記者曰、余亦職務使然、豈容不來乎、遂相與一笑而別、所幸當時敵機並未擲彈、記者乃復返鐵路橋口而立於凱旋路畔、時已下午二時十分、</p>
<p>凱旋路口距離鐵路橋祇三十米、與鐵道成平行綫、記者正向北遙望、詎未及五分鐘、橋北附近忽起緊密之機槍聲、子彈直向閘南如蝗飛至、而同時記者咫尺之凱旋路西叢草中、亦發生還擊之輕機關槍聲、此時橋南駐守之英軍及立於路畔之中西人士、均一齊臥伏於附近溝中、或奔避於汽車之下、記者忙趨避於路旁一清潔局之糞車背面、該糞車係屬鐵裂、以之充作臨時掩護、大有坦克車之效用、惟略帶異味耳、</p>
<p>槍聲愈趨愈密、愈密愈近、子彈簌簌作聲、掠頂而過、近在咫尺一輛奶油色之汽車上、更聞得禿禿擊中響聲、</p>
<p>汽車夫阿方、他也曉得危險、嚇得面如土色、伏在與記者相近的一條溝內、記者急忙呌他上車、踏動引擊、記者便奮不顧身、躍上踏板、向南疾馳而逃、待車抵西站附近、（自凱旋路北端至西站約百米、）記者想起了同來的金張兩君、他們還陷在火綫的中央、假使我一人逃出、而他們竟有什麽不諱、覺得有點居心不忍便命汽車掉頭、不料車子方才轉北、一粿子彈覓咦加一聲、從車頂左角飛過、好像告訴我、你旣然逃出、為什麽又要回去找死、岡方將車子兜了一個圈子、朝南向東、一直開到愚園路口暫停、</p>
<p>不到一刻鐘、老金搭乘了外國老番的車子來了、就在這個時候、路旁的羣衆、突然朝着西面的上空拍手時好、我再同老金轉身一望、哈哈、敵人一羣飛機中、被我軍高射砲擊中了兩架、一架起火下墜、兩個駕駛員用降落傘跳下、一架未曾起火、在空中翻了幾個不規則的觔斗、垂直墜下大槪他是在那見作最後一次的表演吧、未幾張君也來了、接看一位一同站在鐵路橋南的西裝朋友也到了、他說適才路旁有兩個女人、一死一傷、我們三人相顧愣然、隨卽乘車返館、</p>

<p>隨著大塲我軍的南撤，江灣閘北的守軍，在昨晚十時奉到撤退的命令，在一度攻擊的掩護下，全師向滬西移動·這是不是在戰塲我方主力戰敗的結果呢？不！我想，凡是對戰爭稍具常議的人，一定知道這僅是全部抗戰中為適應某種戰略，避免無謂的重大犧牲而出此·有人以為我軍將放棄大上海那也是一種杞憂，我軍决不會在絕對有放棄大上海的必要以前，任整個大上海淪陷敵手的·軍事當局已表示决心確保滬西和南市了。</p>
<p>為欲明瞭滬西的實况起見，昨天下午一時許，在巡視了蘇州河南岸的情况，遙望着整個閘北像大溶爐似的在吐着烈焰，黑烟和火舌奮怒地向藍碧的秋空狂舐後，便向西穿過曹家渡的平民的鬧市，到梵王渡一帶去視察一次。</p>
<p>曹家渡　帝是由　兵駐守的，路中的砂袋堡疊像經過雕琢般的齊整而美麗地躺在地上。他們分隊在人叢中穿來穿去。可是市街上仍是由市警察維持治安，指揮交通。不同的，只是一個多月來漸趨安定的市况，比較稍見忙亂；最顯著的，便是迎面而來的難民的行列。</p>
<p>車子在凱旋路的北端停了下來·我沿着靜靜的蘇州河，穿過安置在路上的鐵絲網，向滬杭甬路梵王渡鐵橋走去。鐵道口的橋門由幾位英軍管理着，陸續讓要求進人越界築路區的難民們從門縫裹擠進來。他們手裹雖然握着鞭子，却用來指揮。三四個外國攝影師，有的用鏡箱，有的用活動攝影機，在栅門外攝取難民們扶老携幼，肩挑背負，顚沛流離的慘狀。</p>
<p>這裏難民，大都是大塲閘北和眞如間這一三角地帶中各村落的居民，是敵機費了七十多天的轟炸所遺剩下來的。也許是太意外，也許是前方的景象太恐怖了，所以不論他們已是走了七代里，抑或一二里，他們都已經顯出極度的疲乏，衣服散亂，神色倉白·大部分的人都是步履瞞跚，沿途顚躓。他們臉色蒼白，眼睛都失了神，失去了中國人民眼睛裹所常具的和平而樸實的光芒。</p>
<p>我走上鐵橋東邊的人行這（現在北端是被堵塞了），對着蘇州河北的高低起伏的田野瞭望。秋陽和春日同樣光彩和溫暖，郊景依然如舊·只是，每一條射向鐵橋的村道上，都只見黑壓壓的一條綫，避難的同跑，像螻蟻般向南爬來。這時，在遠處可以聽到琉落的槍聲，間或是一二聲小鋼砲彈的炸裂聲。敵人的飛機很低的在不遠的空中成羣來去·那飛翔的姿勢仰乎在自豪着，這一次我軍自動的暫時撤退將登入他們的功勞簿一般。</p>
<p>大多數難民在走到鐵橋北端都似乎要昏倒·但仍掙扎着很費力的一步步跨过铁桥的枕木·老婦和孩子們的步武是不夠枕木距離的，于是跌的跌，爬的爬，呌的呌，哭的哭，那直可說是極盡了人間的慘象。凡是人類，除了是日本的殺人不眨眼“劊子手”，那以轟炸平民和不設防城市的日本空軍，誰都會油然起同情之心·</p>
<p>啊！我從來沒有對英國兵起這樣的好感·他們搭起袖管，用那粗壯多毛的手臂，從橋的彼端一次次的一手抱着一兩個正在駭得哭的孩子，一手扶着或抱着龍鐘的老婦或無力行走的婦人們走過橋來：一担担代難民們把衣被或食米挑過橋來；他們流着汗，一次一次，我在那邊的二小時中他們始終是那麽像對自己的家人般眞誠地對難民們援手·我親眼看見難民們對他們感激得落下淚來，我親耳聽見難民們由衷地訴說的感謝話。我知他們雖然不懂得，却也並不是希望人們的謝詞·我第一次看見眞眞的“人”·——他們那種重於助人的精神，實在使人敬佩！</p>
<p>一二二二號華捕（後來知道他呌做嚴秉衡）也是最出力的一個，在橋上只有他一個中國人·他幾乎把全力援助難民·他說：“我沒有錢捐助給國家，可是我有氣力援助人家卻是應該的。”他是一個年靑壯健的北方人。我和他拉手，用對英國兵的敬意和他拉手。</p>
<p>難民們走過鐵橋後，大都沿着蘇州河向西去。我不知道他們的目的地安在。那邊正是未來的大戰傷，要求比較安全，還是沿鐵路綫向南。可是，我無法對每一個避難的同胞拆說。</p>
<p>日本空軍依舊對難民轟炸·我為一個十三四歲的姑娘包紮創口·她的手臂上段給彈片割去了一大塊。她只想逃，却忘記了痛，忘記了不讓血流出來。我一時找不到繃布，我身傍的一位外國攝影師的太太却慷慨的遞過，塊姜鹽清潔的手帕，我用常識為她紮緊，使不再讓血流出·另外有一個五十多歲的老人，前腦給日兵一槍打中了，一個美國兵把他扶上了自己的救護車開走了。</p>
<p>正在這時候，梵王渡的戰事開始了。在鐵路橋的北不遠的一塊高地背後，突然發出了淸脆而連貫的自動步槍聲。目標正對着河南我們——英兵華捕們和難民們·這使橋邊的英國兵都出乎意外，我們顧不得許多男女老少的難民正癱瘓似的坐在地上的難民，最先急忙尋覓一個隱蔽的所在，可是四週都是田野，我們，兩個英兵和攝影師夫人乃一同倒在路邊的水溝裏去。很淺，我們只得把胸部和面部緊貼在水溝的斜坡上。英兵也把子彈登了膛，準備在必要時射擊。河南的鐵路的彼方，立刻以同樣的槍聲向對方報復·我們竟沉陷在火綫的中央了。</p>
<p>對方的子彈“飛——”“飛——”的從我們頭上掠過，也許是太高了，也許是我這靶子沒有提好，我僥悻地沒有受到什麽“刺戟”。可是，我不能不走，我不能斷定這戰事會延長到多久。到後來，我只得在對方的槍身一休止，便向梵王渡車站方面逃。一路尋覓着掩蔽物。當我躲在一輛奶油色轎車側面的時候，我覺得這車子曾讚進好幾顆子彈。假如沒有那輛車，敵人的兩顆子彈或者不會做廢物吧？</p>
<p>我最初找到的掩蔽離對方至多只二三百米光景。到了愚園路，只才覺得安全了一些。</p>
<p>歸來時（二時三刻），幸運地看到兩架敵人的飛機給活生生的打了下來。一架整個的墮下地來，落在北新涇方面我軍的陣地裹。另一架整個的墮下地來，一架在天空中爆烈了，機體粉碎，機師用降落傘徐徐墜落我軍陣地，假如他没有死的活，也許會在南京一度作客吧！</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>從第一綫到第二綫</h3>
<p>— 金仲華</p>
<p>淞滬戰綫上的我軍，於前晚由第一條防綫撤退到第二條防綫。這次的撤退，主要是由於大塲，防禦工事被毁，我軍前綫的戰士，無險可守，而由走馬塘南下直攻眞茹的敵軍，更有截斷我江灣閘北右翼軍隊後路的危險；所以，這是戰略上的撤退，旣不能說是我軍嚴重的失敗，更不足以影響我抗戰的全局。然而兩旬以來，一般人密切關懷大塲的戰局，現在突然聽到撤退的消息，在感情上必有不能自禁的悲憤者；尤其是希望勝利過切的人士，在昨日突聞我軍西移，又目撀閘北烈焰騰空，也許於悲憤之餘，不免有些微失望之感。但我們應該指出，這種感覺，是絕對不可有的。七十五天來淞滬第一綫上的戰爭，在我國抗戰史上實為最大之成功。我們以一個單純的陸軍，抵擋敵人海，陸，空，及機械化部隊四種武力，在一個深約十公里，長約數十公里的江岸，牽制敵艦百艘以上，陸軍二十萬人，海陸軍飛機三百五十架，達二個半月之久；無論何種立塲之軍事家，都不能不驚嘆於我軍戰士之英勇！我們相信，以此種英勇無比之精神，在第二第三或任何防綫上抗戰，其結果將必有更大之成功。</p>
<p>而且，從目前整個的戰局講，我們抗戰的主力陣綫，是在華北，而不在上海，上海為我軍與敵人進行牽制消耗戰的塲合。在這個戰綫上，我方的最大目的，為牽制敵人巨量的軍力，消耗敵人無限的彈藥，使之由疲而竭；但在達到此種目的之戰爭中，我方也當有一定的限度，卽我們自己的軍力不能在此牽制過多，我們的人力與物力都不能在此消耗過巨，以致影響到華北主力抗戰的陣勢。所以，當我軍由寶山吳淞及市中心撤退到第一條防綫的時候，外國軍事家都認為是必要的戰略上的撤退。現在，從九月十一到十月廿六，我軍在第一綫上的抗戰，已達一個半月之久：我方的防禦工事旣已大部被毁，而敵人在兵力上的消耗，也已非常巨大，所以在目前撤退到第二道防綫，在戰略上完全是必要的。</p>
<p>不過，現在有一點必須指出，防綫的移動，决不是放棄，對於上海的防禦，更不是表示這方面的抗戰可以中止的意思。上海是我國金融·工業·文化的中心，我們在可守的時候，决不能輕易使之陷於敵人包圍之中；同時，上海附近鐵路與公路密佈，又為進行陣地戰的必要塲合，我們一旦加以放棄，則敵人的機械化部隊將利用交通上的方便，迅速攫取我江浙一帶各重要地點。所以，在目前，我們的防綫雖然有了部分的移動，我們仍舊應當以保衛上海，作為這方面戰綫上的主要目標。在京滬鐵路以西，蘇州河是一條天然的戰壕；在這條河道以南，我方的防禦工事本來已建築完固；在今後，一面抵住敵人由眞茹南下的攻勢，一面發動廣福與施相公廟側翼之反攻，當可使第二絛防綫成為阻止敵人侵略的一個堅壁。</p>
<p>最後，我們以為目前在上海的我國同胞，尤當有一種淸楚的認識，此次我們與侵略者的抗戰，决不是取快一時的事情，而為一種需要長久支持的艱苦工作。暫時的勝利不足為喜，暫時的後退更不足為懼。我們已經有了七十五天最險惡抗戰的經騐，今後就當以這種重要的經騐，支持長期的抗戰。上海是我國人力物力的一個重要泉源，我們必須齋心協力，絕不搖動，以這個力的泉源，配合於抗戰之中，直到我們民族解放的最後勝利。所以，當我們的抗戰從第一綫移到第二綫的時候，我們不能有任何感情上的搖動，而應當以更大的决心，準備更沉着的努力。</p>

<h3>孫桐崗脫險記</h3>
<p>中央社南京二十六日通訊、十月十二日那一天、我們英勇的飛將軍們、駕着六架飛機奉命出發轟炸塘沽敵人的根據地、可是祇有五架到達了目地、我們孫隊長桐崗所駕的飛機、因為在中途半空中、飛機的推動器、忽然脫落、不能繼續飛行、所以只得對他的同伴舉手示意後、就降落了、當時一般人都以為孫隊長已作了壯烈的犧牲、於是報紙上都紛紛刊載我們最勇敢的飛將軍殉難的消息、我們對這不幸的消息、正在悲哀着、不料孫隊長竟於十八日那一天安然歸來、這正是使人破涕為笑、喜出望外的一樁事、孫隊長雖然沒有駕着原機回來、却帶着－頭英勇的小犬、和一段亦壯亦勇的故事歸來、</p>
<p>事實是這樣、當孫隊長的飛機脫落了推進器時、他和一位同機駕駛的投彈員本可以用降落傘跳下、但他想保全他的飛機、雖在最危險的關頭、也不願犧牲這國家可寶貴的利器、於是向另外五架的同伴舉手、表示一切無恙、囑他們繼續飛往目的地、完成他們偉大的使命、不要顧慮他個人的安全、然後施展他美妙的駕駛術、用滑翔方法完全降陸、這次雖然失去了推動器、可是這回是他有生以來所遇到最順利的降落、</p>
<p>飛機快要降落的時候、他和同伴趕忙從身邊取出手槍因為準備萬一降落在敵人的陣地、他們就和敵人拚個死活、直到槍中只剩最後一粒子彈、然後自殺、以作壯烈的犧牲飛機降下了、他們看見兩個農夫和幾個漁夫、農夫同漁人們看見飛將軍自天而下、用着驚奇的目光望着他們、他們不能辨别飛機上的人是他們的英勇戰士、還是他們的公敵——日本人、於是雙方便開始辯論、農夫起初不信中國人會穿着這樣奇怪的服裝、後來經孫隊長再三的申辯、並且告訴了他的名字、果然這“孫桐崗”三字、却有了相當的效力、他們腦海中、似乎已深印了這三個字、曉得孫桐崗就是全國聞名的飛行家、</p>
<p>這時候、孫隊長突然看見遠處來了一隊穿着黃色制服的軍隊、起初感覺得很驚愕、後來才曉得他們是衛守海岸的將士、他們共有二百人、由一隊長率領、他們因為陣地被敵人佔據、才不得已而撤退的、他們的領隊投降了敵人、但是他們不願作敵人的奴隸供敵人驅使、他們後面還跟着一頭犬、據說也不願跟着主人——他們的領隊上將去投降日本、他們還都穿着夏季的制服耐飢忍寒的等候機會、再來殺敵、</p>
<p>這幫忠勇將士、委實使孫隊長興奮萬分、他這次對我國將士忠勇抗戰又得到一個鐵證、這是如何值得愉快的啊、他和他們談話、知道他們沒有計劃、祗知不願投降日人、於是孫隊長慨然答應暫時統率他們、並允在回到山東後、替他們找工作、和給他們衣食、這時候村子裏的人愈聚愈多了、都歡天喜地的歡迎孫隊長和這一幫鐵血男兒、朋友們、你們好好的替我看管這架飛機罷、孫隊長以和藹的態度叮嚀着這一幫村民、“如果敵人來時、趕快的燒掉牠、倘若敵人不來的話、待我有機會派人或親自來把牠拿回去、孫隊長臨行時、這樣加上一句、他對着飛機表示戀戀不捨的樣子、因為那架飛機除了推動器外、仍是完好如初的、但他終於忍痛率領這一幫弟兄離開了那個村莊、</p>
<p>這時天空上已密佈了黑雲、大雨也傾盆似的倒下來、孫隊長等一行人衆在道途泥濘上行動異常的困難、夜間敵人四十條軍艦上的探海燈、胡亂的向着岸上照射、他們連紙烟也不敢吸、日間他们又須躲避敵人的便衣隊、可是他們鼓着勇氣、冒着危險、不顧飢寒而滿懷的希望、在夜深黑暗中摸索着前進、幸好有那頭忠勇的小犬在前面作嚮導、足足步行了二十四小時、終於安然回到山東省的邊界、</p>
<p>到達目的地後、孫隊長就立刻往謁當局、報告一切的經過、當局極為嘉獎、並給那幫弟兄們換上冬季的制服、羊毛襪子和棉鞋、又把他們編入前綫的隊伍裏去、他們當時感激萬分、他們感謝的不是得到了暖衣飽食、而是從新獲得了殺敵的機會呵、</p>
<p>孫隊長這才忽忽的到火車站去、但他所坐的火車又遭到四架敵機的轟炸、當時有客車兩列被轟毀、幸機車無恙、仍向前駛投、</p>
<p>到達了某飛機塲後、敵機又來投彈、似乎在歡迎孫隊長的樣子、老實說、我們早已置生死於度外了、”孫隊長興奮地回答記者的問話、“我已幾天沒有洗澡和休息了、恕我不能多談、”這樣說着、他便欣然和記者握手道別、記者目送着這位英勇的飛將軍、带着那頭小犬、慢慢的走了、心中對他的脫險感着無限的欣慰、</p>

<h3>戰時日本百態第十</h3>
<p>㊉戰時日本的演劇與電影</p>
<p>思想言論、受軍閥極度壓迫日本、作爲文化一部門的戲劇與電影、受到軍部鐵錘的彈　、自屬意中事、我們先就戲劇方面談談、</p>
<p>日本戲劇、可以大別為商業劇團與藝術劇團、商業劇團、有純古典劇之歌舞伎、及類似中國文明戲之新派劇、而商業劇團受到時局的刺激、競演所謂“軍事物”、日本稱之為“際物”、中國可意譯爲“投機”、便是急就章地把中日戰爭的新聞記事搬到舞台上、非常誇张地描寫日本男人怎样忠勇、後防（日本稱為槍後）怎樣踊躍輸將、或　因壯丁出征、家庭間發生如何的悲劇、再把中國人搬上舞台作丑角、演出種種醜態、或受到日本人的侮辱、以大快低級觀衆的人心、此種低級的軍事物、汜濫於各商業劇塲、汜濫於離開都會的荒山僻陬、對此、日本人自身也為之顰蹙、長田秀雄在戲劇雜誌“La　The　atro”九月號批評道、“中日事變發生、國民均極興奮、劇塲電影院頻頻上演上映戰爭物、然而任你看那一部、幾乎成為定型、從甲午中東戰爭以來、沒有絲毫進步、至於商業主義上的低俗大衆劇、希望在思想上有高度的作品、自然不可能、那樣不識時務的話、現在也不必說、但至少也希望能上演與現下日本國民文化水準相當　度的作品、……在這時期、劇塲影戲院演這種時代錯誤的戲劇與電影、實在是國辱、朝日新聞上也有讀者投函、說軍國劇中、有令人不勝寒心者、如巡行各地之某劇團所演者、從故事起便不遞、而演出又荒唐無稽、不近人情、</p>
<p>至於藝術劇團、近年來本極活躍、除以築地小劇塲為大本營的新築地與新協劇團以外、從去年準備起的左團次之自出劇塲、將於十月舉行第一次公演、而以左田恭助為中心技術者之文學座、有岸田國士·岩田豐雄·久保萬太郎·等參加、亦將以文化學院講堂為本據、隔月公演一次、</p>
<p>可是軍部對這班比較進步的分子之活動、决不肯坐視、於是新築地先碰了釘子、新築地本定於九月二十五日、在日比谷公會堂公演郭戈里之“巡按”、（即上海業餘劇人所曾演之“欽差大臣”）因時局關係、審查未獲通過、九月之大阪公演、亦臨時中止、</p>
<p>新喜劇座則因時局所投之波紋不得不解散、而文學座的技術中心人物友田恭助、則被軍閥征發到上海戰綫戰死、藝術劇團所受軍閥之打擊、可以想見、藝術劇團主持者、似乎仍思在氣悶的日本時局下勉强掙扎、新協劇團於九月二十日起、在築地小劇塲曾公演蘇聯N.D.高爾考夫所改編、託爾斯泰原作之“安娜克蘭妮娜”、新築地則進出於商業的大劇塲、在新宿第一劇塲演“笑的書信”、此劇應用有聲電影、頗似新派之連鎖劇、但因主持者為進步分子、批評界認為是一種有意義的嘗試</p>
<p>次言日本電影、日本電影、也受到中日戰爭的巨流冲蕩、軍　映　、愛國映　、元及市區、令觀衆感覺會塲而最可注意的現象是新聞片子氾濫、因中日戰事之擴大、觀衆急於明𣸥戰地現况、故极愛看新聞片、軍部亦即利用此點、由政府御用通信社同盟社供給戰事新聞片於各電影院、大阪每日新聞·大阪朝日新聞·讀資新聞三社、為宣傳起見、亦各派專員分赴華北上海各戰綫拍攝新聞片配布於各電影館、於是第一個觀衆想看自己愛看的影片之前、莫論願意不願意、非耐意看三十分鍾以上的新聞片不可、日本的新聞片眞是乾燥無味之至、除了在他們日本軍後方拍幾張放砲或行軍的照片以外、中國方面的材料一點也沒有、而且在軍部極度的嚴格檢閱之下、凡與日本不利的地方、一點也顯現不到畫面上、連傷兵及被砲擊的房舍的照片、也被扣禁這種單純的東西、怎能描畫出戰爭的　　氣、</p>
<p>新聞片之外、還是粗秽濫做的軍事片、及淺薄的戀愛片、像中國“漁光曲”“迷途的羔羊”“生死同心”一類比較有時代意義社會意義的影片、可以說絕無僅有、因了時局的關係　　軟派的戀愛片也不大走得通了、於是日本國民、只能看看軍國主義的對建主義色彩和淺薄腐敗的影片、今日的日本人、尤其稍有智識文化教養的日本人、這日子也就不大容易過</p>
<p>附記：戰時日本百態、可寫的材料尚多、如戰時日本的經濟、戰時日本的出版界和新聞界等、限於篇幅　　只有另挨別的機會了、（本篇執筆者露蘭附記）、（完）</p>

<h3>陳家行血戰十日記（上）</h3>
<p>— 誠</p>
<p>記者日前田某處返滬，因當時無順便車輛可乘，徒步東行一小時，頗感疲乏，卽在車棚內略事休息，及走進棚內，適遇一位受傷的靑年軍官，在那裏等候担架，我們彼此通了來歷，就同坐在一個轉輪的邊沿，我很害氣的遞給這位軍官一支香烟，我自己也拿一支吸著，彼此定一定神，就開始接談起來，我很希望在這邂逅相逢的談話中，得到一點比較確實的消息，而這位受傷的靑年軍官，也很願意把他們在戰場的經過情形吿訴找、他是山東人，對人謙恭有禮，我非常的敬重他，雖只略交數語，倒彼此都很傾心，我們便開始密談起來。</p>
<p>同志是那一師的？在什麼地方受傷下來的？貴部這幾天作戰的大槪情形，可否見吿？</p>
<p>我發了這個問題以後，他便現出勝利和槪歎交并的氣色，用很鎮定而悲壯的語氣吿訴我，他們全帥忠勇將士八日夜血戰的經過，茲記述如下。</p>
<p>我們就是九月中旬參加劉行·永安橋·小朱宅，那次與敵人血戰七晝夜，有楊·陳·耿·楊四位營長忠烈殉了難，那一次我們一師與敵人整個一師團主力對戰，雖然敵人裝備較我們强，但是我們終以大無畏的精神把他打退，陣綫始終屹立不搖，詳細情形各大報均已刋載，提起來，先生一定會記得的。</p>
<p>因為上峯顧念士兵疲勞的關係，在九月二十日，把我們換下來休息補充，在很短的時間內，我們就補充完畢了，官兵們的精神也就恢復了，那時上海的很多愛國團體及各界聞人，贈給敝師很多關於作戰有益的物品，廖仲凱夫人等，給我們募了很多的藥品和面具，各團體各私人都捐募了許多什物，這都是我們的長官吿訴找們的。上項的物品，我們都已收到應用了，我們全師官兵對於帮助我們的各團體及各先生，都是非常感謝的。</p>
<p>我們因為國家危急，和自己的責任，以及長官對於我們的鼓勵，各界同胞對於我們的熱烈愛助，我們全師官兵都願意早上前綫，替換友軍繼續作戰，使他們也得回來休息補充一下，因為這種激烈的大戰，瘁一個部隊長時間與敵抗戰是不可能的，必須大家輪流著去打。</p>
<p>我們的師長·旅·團·營長，都是富有學識經騐而英勇無畏的靑年將領，他們在後方是捺不住性的，師長常對我們講，“為國家民族的生存而抗戰，雖犧牲至一兵一伕，决不氣餒一，這話已成我們官兵堅確不移的信條，所以我們把個人的應用物品和彈藥補充齊全以後，我們師長又率領著我們這一萬多血性的健兒於國慶日的前夕，大踏步的開到蕰藻浜左翼陳家行頓悟寺方面，去替換友軍而加入作戰了。</p>
<p>我們二次加入作戰的那一天，正落着大雨，敵人的飛機不能光臨，所以給我們一個白天衝殺的好機會，十月九日這天下午，頓悟寺橋亭宅那方面吃緊了，敵人的大砲衝破了兩點，集中火力轟擊我們頓悟寺的一角，因友軍苦戰月餘，兵力傷亡較重，陣地稍現動搖，敵人乘機侵入了三千餘人，當時我們師長即令潘團長陶萬率領兩營人白畫冒雨反攻，因為這位潘團長和蕭光燦·趙鳳傳兩位營長，向來是最勇敢的，敵我兩軍經過半小時的肉搏戰以後，侵入我們陣地後邊的三百多敵人，三分之二是被我們的刺刀和手溜彈殺死了，逃回去的不到百十人，敵人的死屍，躺在棉花地裏，橫三豎四地査不淸楚，他們的膏藥旗和軍械都送給了我們，這一下子，給了敵人一個重大的膺憼，陣地是被我們這兩營完全恢復了。</p>
<p>那天晚上—國慶前夕—我們全師接替由陳家行至橋亭宅三四華里長的陣地守禦，我門整整作了一夜工，把我們的陣地强固起來，炸彈拿在手裏，槍膛裏裝滿子彈，在等候着倭奴的進攻，因為敵人吃了我們一個大虧，這一夜他未敢進犯，只看見他們用繩子向後面拉他們已死的小鬼。</p>
<p>國慶日那天的早晨，我們從收音機中聽見上海各界與日本經濟絕交的狂呼，同時敵人的大砲又向我們的陣地打過來了，可是我們也不客氣，他們的砲彈來，我們的砲彈去，來一還十的比例數，轟隆隆的互射起來，敵我的陣地前後成了一片黑烟，我們看見我軍的砲彈打過去時，戰士們那拍掌呌好，但是小鬼們可吃盡了苦頭，他們是蜷伏在棉花地裏擦眼淚，呌姆媽，唸阿彌陀佛，但是都不生效力。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>滬戰轉入新階段</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>閘北江灣我軍。從八一三以來。一直表顯着英勇無比的精神。使敵人始終不敢從正面進奪我們的陣地。前晚纔因戰略關係。很有秩序地徹退。於是上海戰爭轉入新階股了。</p>
<p>在過去兩月半的戰爭中間。敵人生命的犧牲並不比我軍少。而所消耗的軍火數量。則比我們大到許多倍。結果是數十方里的土地給敵人暫時佔領了。這片土地受了砲火的洗禮。全成了焦土。敵人必須繼續付出極大的代價來設防。才能夠阻住我軍的反攻。</p>
<p>就另一方面說。我軍兩月半中間的戰蹟。已經給國家爭得了無上的光榮。國際對於我國的同情顯然是跟戰前大不相同了。不但如此。我全國統一團結的精神。也因那麼偉大的戰蹟。而愈加鞏固。現在全國同胞已經相信長期抗戰是我民族唯一的生路了。</p>
<p>第一期上海戰爭的意義就是如此。今後我軍轉入新防綫作戰。軍事上有利的條件更多。當然前途更可以樂觀了。</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>日本拒絕參加九國會議。已正式提出覆文。我也早已料到他們不會參加。萬一參加被許多會國的代表一致嚴辭譴責。那怕你有諸葛亮舌戰羣儒的本領。也只有面紅耳赤而出。所以敵方當局用宣言的方式發表意見他的妙句。便是“日本以容忍的態度促進中國之好感。不期中國缺乏感賞能力。竟對日作挑釁行為致使日本不得不自衛而戰”。這一番說話。不怕世界人聽了。笑掉他們的牙齒麼。日本自九一八後侵略行為。步步進逼。種種罪狀。不勝枚舉。還說促進中國的好感。這種好感我們實在不敢領敎非特像我忍耐性最好的國家欣賞不來恐怕任何國家也欣賞不來。敵人閉了眼珠子。對於世界能發表得出這樣的話眞是不要臉面了。</p>

<p>㊀在陋巷裹的陳獨秀先生</p>
<p>一個多月前，以“愛國情殷，深知侮悟”。這八個字，而受了特赦出獄的陳獨秀先生，那以後不久，就到了武漢。</p>
<p>雖說，有一時，曾是中國第二大政黨首要的他；雖說十年前，曾代表了共產黨，和國民黨領袖，發表聯合宣言的他；但，較之實際政冶活動方面來，還是他那在理論，在學說方面的姿態，更爲引起全國人士們深長的回憶，和熱烈的注意吧。從政治生命說，遠在他的入獄以前，即使在他所隸屬的政黨內部，也可以說是中斷；不過，作爲一個理論家，思想家看，即使在今天，像中國對日抗戰這樣的大事，也有傾聽一下他的議論的必要。這麼想着的記者，於是，就和本報的兩位先生，在漢口一碼頭，上了去武昌的輪渡，向訪問他的路上行進着了。</p>
<p>依照前一天約定的時間，到了他住處的門前。這裹，可以說是一個陋巷之類的地方。窄窄的巷子裹，瀰漫着觸鼻的腥臭氣，對峙在兩旁的那些宅子，竟有些是歪倒着門板，把屋裹一些破破爛爛的傢俱，全暴露在過客們的眼裹。二十六號門牌，是一個比較整齋的石庫門，這時，也闢敞着。進了門。是一個院子，栽着些花草·有一條碎石路在脚下展開了。路旁，一順排着幾個門，院子裹，連一個人也沒有，這使記者躊躇起來了，祇得大聲嚷着：</p>
<p>“有人麽？有人麽？”</p>
<p>不知究竟在那個門裹隔着好幾道墻似的，傳過來一種低啞的女人聲音：“找麼人呀？找麼人呀？”—從這個“麼”字上，知道是本地口音。</p>
<p>“陳先生住在這裹嗎”？</p>
<p>“姓陳的呀？姓陳的住在西首那個門裹。</p>
<p>沿着碎石路，向西走了幾步，立刻發現了，在這條路的盡西端，有個門上，貼着一張絛子，那上面，正是寫着我們要找的“陳宅”兩個字。</p>
<p>雙扇門掩着門板上，塗着綠漆，沒有春聯，代替的，却是格言似的，嵌着四排緋紅色的字句：“說好話”，“做好人”，“行好事”，“讀好書”。這字句，從漆上看，好像已經很久了。然而，以一個曾有着像陳先生那樣經歷的人，現在，却住在這所宅子裹，是令人感到意味深長的事。</p>
<p>一面動手拍門，一面把曾由陳先生親筆寫着地址的我的名片拿在手裹，準備對付那個山来開門的傳達之類的人物，據記者的經驗，凡是名人的傳達，對他掏出有着他主人親筆寫着些什麼的名片，那是，至少可以免掉他到底還是用“我替你去看看，”或乾脆用“不在家”這樣考慮的。</p>
<p>門很快地打開了。出乎我的意料之外；開門的，却就是陳先生自己。他穿着灰布長衫，躬着身子立在門旁，不住地微笑着，說：“請進，請進。”他那學者風的，禿了一半的頭，僅僅在後腦上勝着些花白的頭髮；高聳着的眉稜，覆着炯炯的雙眼，短髭微翘着，而最引人注意的，却是他那顯出富於智慧的，寬廣的前額。——這一切將他不是平凡人物的處所，一剎那間，就呈現在往訪者的眼裹了。</p>
<p>跨進門，就是一個豆腐乾式的，長不到三四丈，闊僅一丈事的院子。上面彷彿搭着大篷，一切顯得非常陰暗，加上絲絲的細雨，於是，更加陰氣森森了。院子的一面，是我們進來的那個前門；一面，是牆；一面，是按着　扇的屋子；而那西首的一面，却就是陳先生在這裹接見我們的會客室。對於這樣局促，窄狹，陰濕的地方，一進門，我們就有被堵住喘不過氣來似的感覺。我們一面向會客室走…，一面，同同去的本報兩位先生，就向陳先生通報着姓名。走，走，走，………然而，要不了幾步，我們發現，自己已經身在會客室裹了。</p>
<p>會客室也是豆腐乾式的，門開在拐上角，一面窗子向着陰暗的院子裹。雖然是正午，但那位背朝窗子坐着的先生，我却始終也看不淸他的面貌。牆上是否有對聯一類的飾物，已經記不清了。幾張椅子，不很整齋地放着。地面上，雖然也舖着一塊厚的地毯，但那霉濕的情景，令人首光聯想起來的，却是一間存放陳舊物件的儲藏室。</p>
<p>陳先生我們報中同去的三人而外，在座的，另外還有三位先生。落座後，我先問：陳先生你們有要事麼一？</p>
<p>“不，也是隨便談談”。</p>
<p>想到陳先生目前的處境，以想到我們，這回夥拜訪者的新聞記者的身份，這一來，在陳先生那方面，當然的，要生出了種種𩓖慮的吧。我竭力抑制地打算着；還是不要談太具體的問題，令陳先生感到難以開口，爲最好。</p>
<p>因爲前一天聽到陳先生的演講，在“抗日意義”這個題目下，他曾向着一千多個聽衆說：這一次的抗日戰爭，絕不是單純的對日仇恨的發洩；而是，中華民族在她的建立現代國家的路上，不得不碰到的戰爭；中國想建立自由平等的現代化國家。不得不先從次殖民地的地位上，解放出來，而首先碰到的，却是對帝國主義的决戰。所以，他又說，那前途是祇有兩個的；勝的話，中華民族整個解放，踏上建國的坦途；敗的話，四萬五千萬同胞，毫無例外的，一齊淪爲帝國主義者的奴隸。</p>

<h3>全面抗戰下的最俊勝利</h3>
<p>— 趙慰祖</p>
<p>中國爲制止暴日貪求無饜的慾望，對日本的全面抗戰，己經開始，中國在歷史上是一個渴求和平的民族，就是在事變沒有暴發以前，還是希冀着和平，委員長說過“…和平未至絕望，决不放棄和平…”但是日本的暴行，决不能再說和平。”以前的且不談，單說“九一八”到現在，是整整的六年，吾們拱手送掉了東北四省的土地，不用武力去對付，只運用外交的途徑去收復失地，這樣忍耐着，可以說充分表現了力求和平的苦心，但日本的軍閥，不能暸解中國的寬大，得寸進尺，不但佔了平津，並想蓆捲整個的華北，諸位：他們得了東四省，還要平津，更想華北，當然他們更想要華中華南以至中國整個的土地，難道我把整個的中國，也就輕易地送掉麼？難道有五千年文化，佔全世界十二分之一土地的古老大國，斷送在小小日本的手裹麼？事實上决不會有的，有人道在，有正義在，有天理在，所以，中個對於日本的抗戰序幕，在這次的“八一三”就開端了，我們相信，祇要我們能擁護政府，服從領袖，全面抗戰，堅持到底，最後的勝利一定是我們的馳。過去一般人抱着錯誤的“恐日病”，認爲中國不能和日本開戰，認爲中國的軍備萬萬不及日本。在上海未開戰前，一般人就猜想，日本的飛機，一定肆無忌憚的在上海領空施巨大威脅，但結果，不僅有着雙方的空軍在對抗，並且中國的飛行技術远出日本以上，使國際的觀瞻完全改變，六年來的努力建設，空軍的進步如此，其他的進展，可想而知，我們根據各方面的觀察來證明在全面抗戰之下最後的勝利，是必定屬於我們的。</p>
<p>第一在外交方面，中國佔着絕端的優勢，在各國的報章雜誌間，一般的輿論都是同情中國，痛責日本軍閥窮乓黷武。再觀察日本的一切舉動，均與各國不利，因爲日本的對華侵略的結果，將在各國對華貿易，有極大損失，此次日本利用兵艦，封鎖中國海口，在中國是毫無損夫，而外人對華的商業大受打擊了，在這種情况之下，日本的外交陷於孤立是必然的了，但國際間極重勢利，不尚公道。美國是我們認爲最最同情的國家，這次禁止軍火出口，可以說完全於日本有利，其也的國家可思而知。我們當然要靠自己不靠別人，但求少一個敵人，不求依賴人家，這次的抗戰，至少得到世界民衆輿論的同情，把日本的殘忍滅絕人道的行爲引起反感，在這方面人格國體上佔着最大的勝利的。</p>
<p>第二在經濟方面，日本更覺得危險，我們假定他們每年的軍費支出是二百萬萬元，則日本恐不能支持一年，他的國內，自己沒有充足的準備金，國民經濟能力也全仗在華的貿易，如一再增加，必至內部的崩潰，到那時他們必出於求借外債的一途，但是他們沒有抵押，沒有信用，任同一個國家不肯借出沒有保障的款項，所以他們在經濟方面的威脅，是一個致命傷。（未完）</p>

        <h1>1937.10.28</h1>
<h3>General Headquarters Announces Retreat to New Defense Line is Not Abandonment of Shanghai</h3>
<p>We still firmly defend the south bank of the Suzhou Creek and Pudong, deeply understanding the significance of retreating, and morale remains high.</p>
<p>General Headquarters yesterday announced the reasons and process of our army's retreat from Zhabei and Jiangwan to the new defense line, as follows: In early October, the positions of our army in Shanghai and the Yangtze River region, when viewed on a map, resembled two vertical lines connected by a horizontal line. The first zone was a vertical line, connecting the Yangtze River with the Yunzaobang near Jiading and Nanxiang. The second zone was a horizontal line, along the south bank of the Yunzaobang estuary, until it connected with the third zone near Jiangwan. This formed another vertical line, with Zhabei as its end point. The enemy repeatedly failed in attacks on the first and third zones, and only in early this month did they manage to stealthily breach the Yunzaobang and break into the second zone, resulting in fierce and bloody battles. In the area around Liuhang Xingda Chang alone, the enemy suffered as many as 20,000 casualties, and our army also suffered heroic sacrifices. By the beginning of this week, the enemy advanced towards Dachang, cutting off the Nanxiang-Dachang highway. At that time, our highest military authority had already decided to order the troops to retreat from the third zone, because the enemy's actions threatened to block the exit between the town and the Public Concession, and encircle our army in Jiangwan and Zhabei. Therefore, on the evening of the 25th, our army ordered a counter-attack, under which cover our protruding troops safely retreated without any loss. Our army's current new deployment forms a straight line from the Yangtze River to the Suzhou Creek. The retreat of the protruding troops in Jiangwan and Zhabei has greatly shortened our army's defense line and moved it far away from the range of enemy naval guns in the Huangpu River. Foreign military observers and journalists have repeatedly raised the question of why our army did not take this kind of military action earlier, but our entire country is determined to make the invaders pay a huge price for every inch of land they invade in Shanghai, so it was delayed. Currently, our army's retreat to the new defense line cannot be regarded as abandoning Shanghai, as the entire area south of the Suzhou Creek, including Nanshi, and Pudong, are firmly defended by our army. Our soldiers deeply understand the meaning of this decision to retreat to the new defense line, so morale remains extremely high.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th, Reuters: The Chinese military authorities here are not alarmed by the development of the Shanghai front, and say that the retreat of the Chinese army to the Taicang-Nanxiang line was expected. The fact that the Chinese army was able to hold out for more than two months before retreating was beyond the expectations of the people and worthy of surprise. Troops had been deployed on the new line before the withdrawal of the main force on the front, so there is no fear of the Japanese army breaking through. Furthermore, there are many solid defense lines behind the new defense line. If the Japanese army continues to advance westward or southward, the Chinese army will resolutely resist them step by step, it is said. A reporter from the Central News Agency's accompanying troops reported the following points at midnight on the 27th: The reporter should solemnly report to the compatriots of the country: ㊀ Our army's retreat to the new defense line due to strategic considerations should not be regarded as a military defeat. Some foreign military strategists believe that it would have been beneficial for our army to retreat to the new defense line earlier to fight the enemy, but our army adopted a strategy of attrition. In the past 75 days of resistance, we have held firm to the determination that the enemy must pay a price for every inch of land they advance. The enemy has exhausted all its strength after six reinforcements and five general offensives, and has suffered more than 100,000 casualties, which has exceeded our army's predetermined goal. ㊁ The retreat from Zhabei and Jiangwan is by no means an abandonment of Shanghai, nor can it be regarded as the end of the Shanghai battle. Our army has firmly guarded the south of the Suzhou Creek and is determined to defend Nanshi with all its strength. The Zhongshan Road has already been destroyed, and the Fanhongdu Railway Bridge was also blown up at about 7 pm this month, making it difficult for the enemy to cross. The Pudong side is as solid as a rock and can be worry-free. ㊂ The new defense line has become stable. The Zhenru and Pengpu areas are still in bloody battles as of the time of reporting, and the enemy is not easy to advance. ㊃ On the left flank, only the area of ​​Shixianggong Temple Tushan has been slightly shifted backward, and there is no change in the rest. ㊄ Our army decided to withdraw according to the predetermined plan, in an orderly manner, without any chaos, and the morale is stronger than before. The people of the country should abide by the iron rule of not being arrogant in small victories and not discouraged in small defeats, and prepare for a protracted war.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson of the Military Headquarters on the Change of the New Defense Line of Our Army</h3>
<p>In order to achieve the goal of a protracted war</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th: The spokesperson of the Ministry of Military Affairs gave a statement on the 27th regarding the change of the new defense line of our army in Shanghai: Our army's position has been moved from the 9/13 line to the Jiangwan-Yunzaobang line for more than 40 days. The enemy army bombed our position day and night with artillery and aircraft. The enemy and us fought back and forth on this line no less than dozens of times. Our army made many heroic sacrifices. The enemy's massive casualties are also unprecedented. Foreign military observers judge that the enemy army has lost its status as a first-class army power. This is our goal of attrition against the enemy army on this line, which has been completely achieved. Moreover, in view of the fact that the position in the Jiangwan-Dachang area is too prominent, and the original field fortifications have been destroyed by the enemy's fierce artillery fire, in accordance with the needs of the battle, and in order to achieve the goal of a protracted war, and to reorganize the front line and reduce losses, on the evening of the 26th, the Jiangwanzhen, Dachang, and the Xinjingqiao and Baichangzhai areas to the west were automatically abandoned, and moved to the established position behind them. Currently, the positions in the Guangfu and Liuhe areas have not changed. In order to ensure more accurate consolidation for the contact between last night's change of the new defense line, the Pengpu and Jinan New Village areas are still firmly defended by our army. Therefore, our army's movement will not have any impact on our plan to fight to the end.</p>
<h3>Not Arrogant in Small Victories and Not Discouraged in Small Defeats, Our Army Guards the New Defense Line</h3>
<p>The entire line is more than 30 kilometers long, and the defense is increasingly consolidated, determined to fight the enemy to the death with the spirit of resistance.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: According to military sources, after the first line of defense between Dachang and Nanxiang was broken through by the enemy yesterday morning, the Zhenru Radio Station also reported an emergency. The four districts of Dachang, Miaohang, Jiangwan, and Zhabei were surrounded on all sides. Our military authorities, in view of the fact that being trapped there would only result in major sacrifices, and that a protracted war is not about gains and losses in a single time and place, for the sake of preserving strength, had to make an orderly retreat in two phases yesterday morning at 9 am and 10 pm, guarding the new defense line. Along the Suzhou Creek to Fanhongdu Railway Station, then along the railway to Zhenru Nanxiang, our army's battle line has undergone drastic changes in two days, but it has absolutely no impact on the Shanghai battle situation. The soldiers on the front line all embrace the spirit of "not being arrogant in small victories and not discouraged in small defeats" and continue to fight, while the two places in the southwest of Shanghai and Nanshi are still firmly defended by our army.</p>
<p>The defense of the entire line is becoming more and more consolidated</p>
<p>Central News Agency: According to military sources, the troops stationed in the Jiangwan and Zhabei districts of our army retreated to the southwest the night before for strategic reasons. By 4:30 am yesterday morning, the new defense line had been deployed south of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and north of the Suzhou Creek. The entire line is more than 30 kilometers long, starting from the vicinity of the Central Mint in western Shanghai, heading west through the two towns of Zhenru and Jiangqiao, turning northwest to Xiaonanxiang, and turning northeast to Guangfu. The Shixianggong Temple area also shifted westward, retreating to Dengqiao Town to form a vertical line with Liuhe. The defense of the entire line is becoming increasingly consolidated. If the enemy comes to attack, we will fight the enemy to the death with the spirit of resistance.</p>
<p>Fierce battles in two places before the retreat</p>
<p>Central News Agency Zhenru accompanying reporter reported at 12:30 noon on the 27th: The enemy army attacked Dachang fiercely. The first line of defense west of Dachang was broken through by them, and the enemy advanced southward. The Zhenru Wireless Radio Station immediately started a fierce battle. We sent reinforcements to the rescue on the one hand, and on the other hand, we moved back from the three districts of Dachang, Miaohang, and Jiangwan to the southwest from 9 am the day before yesterday (26th) due to the fear that the rear road would be cut off. They gathered on the second line of defense to defend Zhabei Zhenru. Then, in the evening, the Zhenru Radio Station reported another emergency, and Zhabei was also threatened. Therefore, at 10 pm, an order was issued to continue the retreat and defend the line of the North Station, Pengpu, and Jinan University. At that time, the fierce battle near the Zhenru Radio Station had not ended. At the Mengjiazhai area east of Xiaonanxiang, contact was made again. Although our army retreated with humiliation for strategic reasons, the morale was high and never discouraged. The fierce battles in both places were still going on yesterday morning (27th). As for the North Station, it also gradually retreated westward. By dawn yesterday (27th), the Zhabei stronghold, which had been firmly defended for more than 70 days, had to be abandoned with pain.</p>
<p>Zhabei area suffered a terrible catastrophe</p>
<p>When our army retreated from Jiangwan Zhabei, it was rapid and orderly, and the enemy army did not notice it. They still bombarded with artillery a lot, but did not see any movement. It was not until after dawn yesterday that they groped and advanced under the cover of aircraft and tanks. Wherever the enemy's trace went, they still fired guns at the defensive fortifications left by our army, and searched house by house to drive out the residents, either killing them or arresting them. They then set fire to burn them. Therefore, after 8 am yesterday morning, dozens of places caught fire from Jiangwan to Maigen Road Station. The miserable smoke condensed for several miles. After nightfall, the fire was as bright as day. The prosperous area of ​​Zhabei was completely destroyed, which is very sad. The residents of the Tanziwan area of ​​Zhabei could not withstand the enemy's pursuit and fled to western Shanghai, gathering along the Suzhou Creek. The volunteer army and British army stationed on the south bank of that area were enthusiastic about rescuing them, but the enemy aircraft continued to drop bombs, causing many casualties and injuries, which was very tragic. In the Xujiahui area, there were also many refugees, crowding outside the iron gates of the French Concession, and had not dispersed by evening.</p>
<h3>Fire in the Black Night of Zhabei</h3>
<h3>Our Army Fiercely Fought the Enemy Near the International Radio Station</h3>
<p>Enemy army killed by us 1,500 people</p>
<p>Central News Agency Zhenru accompanying reporter reported at 1:20 am on the 28th: The right wing of our army's new line of defense, with Pengpu as the center, west to Jinan New Village, and southeast to Tanziwan, has become stable. The enemy who advanced to the Zhenru International Radio Station attempted to continue to the south along Taopu starting yesterday morning, but was intercepted by our large army at Xujiaqiao and Wujia Ku Houjigangzhai, etc. south of the radio station, resulting in fierce battles. The invading enemy had three regiments, led by 13 tanks. By 2 pm, the battle became more intense. Our army fought bravely and relentlessly, with no retreat. In the fierce battle until about 4 pm, the enemy suffered as many as 1,500 casualties. Our army's casualties also reached 1,000. After this fierce battle, the enemy's fierce flame was killed, and they retreated immediately. According to the above-mentioned places, it is about 1 kilometer away from Jinan New Village and about 2 kilometers away from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Also, on the line from Pengpu to Tanziwan, we also guarded with fresh troops. The enemy attacked from the northeast end of Zhongshan Road yesterday morning and engaged in street fighting several times. More than 300 people were killed by us. By 4 pm, the battle became more intense and was still in a fierce battle at the time of reporting. The enemy army seemed to be attacking with all its strength, but it has not succeeded.</p>
<h3>Tragic and Heroic, Worthy of Praise, Our Isolated Army Vows to Resist Japan to the Death</h3>
<p>In order to win the great personality of our country, we are willing to give the last drop of blood and not return alive.</p>
<p>Although the majority of our army in Zhabei safely retreated before dawn yesterday morning, this does not mean that there are no traces of our army in Zhabei. More than 800 loyal and brave soldiers above the battalion of our 88th Division, led by Regiment Commander Xie Qingyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Ruifu, are still in the midst of the flames surrounding the enemy army, using their last drop of blood and last bullet to demand the price they should pay to the enemy army. They are staging a magnificent battle that shocks the heavens and earth, makes the ghosts and gods cry, and will be forever recorded in history. This battalion of loyal and brave soldiers was ordered to guard the key points and cover the retreat of the main force. After the main force retreated safely, there was sufficient time to withdraw completely, because our North Station troops had completed the withdrawal at about 4 am yesterday morning, and the enemy army did not advance until about 6 am. However, this battalion of loyal and brave soldiers was determined to sacrifice, willing to give the last drop of blood to win the great personality of our country, promote the magnificent spirit of the nation, and unwilling to return alive. After they left the key points they were guarding, they divided a small number of soldiers to live in the major buildings on the north of Xinlaji Bridge, while the majority of the soldiers were majestically based in the seven-story building of the Sihang Savings Bank warehouse west of the bridge. They lived on each floor and guarded firmly by the windows. At that time, the British garrison in the concession of Tibet Road, seeing that they were in a dangerous situation of being surrounded, was inspired by human sympathy and asked them to disarm and pass through the concession, but our loyal and brave soldiers firmly refused the British army's kindness, preferring to die rather than go. In a short while, the enemy troops came one after another, but the scattered gunshots rang out, and the enemy troops fell one after another, because at this time, they cherished the bullets far more than their lives and dared not shoot without aiming. Yesterday at noon, the reporter personally went to a certain place on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek to inspect the situation on the opposite bank. He saw three enemy soldiers, each holding two of our civilians, walking arrogantly near the Wuzhen Road Bridge. Suddenly, one of our soldiers jumped out and shot dead the two enemy soldiers in front. Another enemy soldier pushed away the two civilians he was holding and rushed forward with a gun, but was bravely stopped by the two civilians and was instantly killed by our army. He also saw an enemy soldier lurking in a tall building, raising his gun to shoot at our soldiers passing by the area, but our army in another building had already fired accurate bullets and knocked the enemy soldier down. From noon to 3 pm, the enemy army launched a large-scale attack on the Sihang Savings Bank warehouse, with people surging like a tide, trying to break in. At this time, our army fired machine guns and threw hand grenades, and the enemy army killed reached 60 or 70 people. From then on, the enemy army took a surrounding shape and dared not move forward lightly. The reporter witnessed this magnificent situation and could not help but be moved to tears. According to the reporter's investigation, the loyal and brave soldiers trapped in the building still have sufficient weapons and ammunition to kill the enemy, but the supply is cut off, which is really worrying. At about 6 pm, Regiment Commander Xie and Battalion Commander Yang issued a heroic appeal, requesting to supply 500 pounds of sugar and salt each, and 50,000 sesame cakes. Then our entire battalion of loyal men and soldiers can fight to the death with the enemy for a week, and die without regret.</p>
<p>The English Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that a number of Chinese soldiers in Zhabei were unwilling to obey the order to retreat. This afternoon (27th), they were in the midst of flames on all sides, and the road to retreat was cut off by the Japanese army, so their position was extremely dangerous. Several observers said that there were 4,000 Chinese soldiers who would rather die in Zhabei than retreat before the enemy's attack. There are many fires in Zhabei, and it is now believed that they were set by Japanese soldiers in the hope of forcing out the Chinese soldiers hiding in the mountains. The British anti-aircraft gunners defending the border of the Public Concession shot down several Japanese aircraft that flew into their defense zone today, and several of them were proud of hitting the target with their shells. Several Japanese aircraft shook after the British soldiers opened fire. The British soldiers were deeply afraid that the Japanese soldiers would continue to harass them, so they all took off their coats today, sweating profusely, and busy putting sandbags to strengthen their defenses. The military police on the western border of the French Concession have made special preparations, but no special incident has occurred as of noon today. It is said that no Chinese soldiers or refugees hope to force their way into the concession. The Japanese army is now continuing to press on Zhenru, so observers predict that the Chinese army on the section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway from Zhongshan Road to Zhenru will continue to retreat to the south bank of the Suzhou Creek. At 2 am this morning, several landmines exploded in Zhabei, and the area on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek felt the shock.</p>
<p>A small team of Chinese soldiers is still holding several houses on the north bank of Suzhou Road, just west of the Xizang Road Bridge, at noon today (27th). Japanese soldiers are cautiously advancing from the rubble in the hope of driving these people away, but they encountered fierce machine-gun fire. The retreat of these Chinese soldiers has been cut off, and it is clear that they are determined to die there. The bodies of the dead Japanese soldiers are piled up and can be seen from across the bank. Japanese soldiers are dragging their dead and wounded soldiers away in the streets. There are also some Chinese soldiers fighting back against the Japanese soldiers behind small sandbag shelters on the bank of the Suzhou Creek in Zhabei. The Japanese soldiers surrounded them on all sides and fired machine guns from the roof of a large nearby warehouse. There are many Chinese and foreigners watching this magnificent battle from convenient locations in the concession. Although the police dissuaded them, the crowd did not disperse, and some foreigners carried cameras in the hope of capturing the actions of the Japanese soldiers. Japanese soldiers on the opposite bank raised their guns and posed as if to shoot, so the photographers were all frightened and fled. Now only Japanese soldiers can be seen on the opposite bank. These Chinese soldiers are either daredevils or they saw that their comrades who did not resist this morning were all killed by Japanese soldiers, so they would rather fight the Japanese soldiers. Some foreigners have witnessed Japanese soldiers forcing Chinese soldiers who were captured to dig a hole and then shooting them and throwing their bodies into the hole. There were several people who were forced to suffer this fate, and foreigners did not witness them one by one, so they could not list the numbers, but judging from the situation this morning, there must be very few Chinese soldiers captured in Zhabei. A shed with barbed wire around it has been built opposite the British barracks today to accommodate Chinese soldiers who disarm and enter the concession, but there are very few people entering at present. Several other soldiers swam across the river because their retreat had been cut off and have been handed over to the police station for custody. According to reports from the British defense positions in the western district, although a large number of Chinese soldiers passed through the British defense line this morning, they did not attempt to enter the defense area. Many wounded Chinese soldiers were released into the concession by British soldiers and sent to the hospital by trucks. The British soldiers also assisted in this humanitarian work. The rumor that there was a conflict between British soldiers and Chinese soldiers is completely unfounded.</p>
<h3>The Rumor that All British Nationals in Shanghai are Being Evacuated is Not True</h3>
<p>Central News Agency London 27th Havas: The rumor that the British authorities in Shanghai have ordered all British nationals currently in the Public Concession in Shanghai to evacuate has been denied by official sources, who said that the British authorities have taken various measures to protect the lives and property of British nationals.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Rampaged, Three Were Shot Down Yesterday</h3>
<p>One was hit by British troops</p>
<p>At 8 am yesterday morning, a large number of enemy planes rampaged and bombed both sides of the Suzhou Creek in western Shanghai. One bomb fell about 100 yards from the British military defense area on Kaixuan Road. The British troops stationed there immediately opened machine guns to fight back, and one was hit by them. It swayed in the air and was about to fall. Another enemy plane crashed near Maigen Road. The British said that this plane was shot down by our army. At about 3 pm, two more teams of enemy planes dropped bombs in the Zhoujiaqiao area west of Kaixuan Road. When the enemy planes were wreaking havoc, one plane dived straight down from high altitude, just as it was about to drop bombs, when the fuselage touched another enemy plane. The plane that was touched was immediately destroyed. The plane also swayed and was about to fall. The pilot immediately opened a parachute and descended, landing in our army's position. The plane was also destroyed.</p>
<p>Fast News Agency this port 27th report, between 7:30 am and 10:30 am this morning, Japanese aircraft repeatedly threw bombs near the British military defense line on Kaixuan Road and swept downwards with machine guns. British troops used anti-aircraft machine guns to fight back against the Japanese aircraft five times. In the last fight, one Japanese aircraft was hit and caught fire and crashed. According to eyewitness reports, the Japanese aircraft's brutal bombing is now even more intensified. This morning, more than 500 civilians who fled in western Shanghai were bombed to death or killed by machine guns. It is said that four British soldiers were also injured (one said two).</p>
<p>Central News Agency said that the local English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that the British soldiers defending the border of the concession shot at the aircraft several times yesterday (27th). Several soldiers claimed that they had hit the Japanese aircraft. When they shot, they saw the Japanese aircraft shake in the air. British soldiers yesterday built and dismantled sandbags at various defense locations to consolidate and defend themselves. According to foreign observers, at 7:45 am yesterday morning, the British soldiers defending the border of the concession along Bailinan Road shot at the aircraft five times with machine guns because the Japanese aircraft attacked the British military defense area and its vicinity. The Japanese aircraft fled in panic after the British soldiers opened fire.</p>
<h3>Japanese Anti-Aircraft Shell Killed Italian Sailor</h3>
<p>Hasegawa and Okamoto Apologize to the Italian Army</p>
<p>At about 2 am yesterday morning, when our air force flew to Shanghai to attack the enemy's position at night, the enemy ships in the Huangpu River fired anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns indiscriminately, causing many shells to fall into the Italian military defense area on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek in the concession, killing one Italian soldier, named Bo Dula. Afterwards, the Italian military authorities immediately protested to the headquarters of the Japanese Third Fleet. Hasegawa immediately sent a representative to apologize to the Italian army. The Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Okamoto, visited the Italian Consul General in Shanghai, Nilang, yesterday afternoon, admitting that the Italian soldier was indeed killed by a stray bullet from the Japanese anti-aircraft gun, and expressed deep condolences on behalf of his government and promised to compensate the loss of the husband. The Italian Consul General immediately stated that the Japanese military authorities should take all possible measures to prevent the same incident from happening again.</p>
<h3>Our Army in Pudong Bombed Enemy Base Last Night</h3>
<p>The Air Force Came to Shanghai to Assist in the Battle</p>
<p>At 8:30 last night, our artillery positions in Pudong once fiercely bombed the enemy's base in the eastern Shanghai area. Enemy ships in the Huangpu River also fired back immediately. For a time, the loud rumbling sound shocked the surrounding area. Due to this mutual attack, the sound of the enemy's air force coming to Shanghai for a night raid was drowned out by the sound of artillery fire. Therefore, it was not until our aircraft flew to the enemy's base in Yangshupu and dropped many bombs that the enemy ships in the Huangpu River realized that our army had already flown over their position. In a panic, they had to stop firing and used searchlights to illuminate the sky, firing anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns into the air indiscriminately. Unexpectedly, our air force's mission was over and they had already safely flown far away from the enemy's position. The enemy's position in Yangshupu caught fire immediately after being hit by several bullets from our army and burned fiercely. At 1:30 am, our aircraft came to Shanghai again and dropped many bombs on the enemy's position.</p>
<h3>Letter to Compatriots from the City Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>The more we are oppressed, the more we must resist; the more we fail, the more we must strive.</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Party Headquarters yesterday published a letter to compatriots. The original text is as follows: Dear compatriots, our resolute and righteous war of resistance against the aggressors, for justice, dignity, survival, and self-defense, has been going on for three months now. During these three months of resistance, our brave soldiers have fought bloody battles, advancing without retreating, knowing only the survival of the country and not their own personal life or death. Their spirit is tragic and magnificent, their sacrifices are so terrible as to shock heaven and earth and move the gods. Our loyal and chivalrous people in the rear have also contributed money and effort to supply the military, enabling the soldiers at the front to receive material assistance and spiritual encouragement, and thus repeatedly defeat strong enemies and defend our territory. This spirit of military and civilian cooperation to resist the enemy and defend against humiliation is truly the greatest manifestation of the Chinese national soul, arousing international praise and winning world sympathy. It can be seen that it is by no means accidental. Now, although we have made a planned withdrawal due to strategic considerations, this is a common phenomenon in the process. Moreover, the success of our long-term resistance lies not in being able to advance, but in being able to defend; not in the present of victory, but in the future of perseverance. The events of the European War can serve as a mirror. Therefore, today we do not need to ask whether we can win, but only whether we can persevere. And to grasp this characteristic of perseverance, everything depends on the strength of our military and civilians' will, the invigoration of our spirit, the breadth of our vision, and the correctness of our thinking. We must not be arrogant in small victories or discouraged in small defeats. No matter how the environment changes, we must never shake our determination to resist to the end. The three armies can be deprived of their formations, but the common man cannot be deprived of his will. Even when besieged, even under high pressure, we will never bow our heads or bend our knees, waiting for the arrival of final victory. During the long siege of Madrid, Spain, the people of the capital were in the midst of the siege, but they continued to contribute money to save the country, beating drums to assist the war effort, without wavering or surrendering. Therefore, they were able to create a strong fighting force to wait for victory in the future. Isn't this an excellent example for us today? Dear compatriots, we must be calm and composed. The more we are oppressed, the more we must resist; the more we fail, the more we must strive. As long as we have the determination to sacrifice and the will to persevere, final victory will surely belong to us. To be arrogant before victory, to be discouraged before defeat, to waver at the slightest setback – these are the inferior characteristics of a lowly nation. We must not be like that. Let us strive, my dear compatriots.</p>
<p>In addition, the Anti-Enemy Support Propaganda Committee also issued a letter to the people yesterday. The wording is lengthy, so it is omitted.</p>

<h3>The Enemy's Landing Force Invades Jinmen County, the City Falls</h3>

<h3>Li Zongren Returns to Nanjing from the Front and Expresses His Views on the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Organizing the People is the Top Priority; Although the Enemy is Stubborn, Victory Ultimately Belongs to Us</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Li Zongren, who recently returned from the front, expressed his views on the war of resistance to reporters. Li first said that the invasion of our country by the violent Japanese, with their carefully planned and deliberate intent, is to destroy the entire China. We must resist to the death in order to defend our territory. Observing our brave soldiers on the front lines, fighting bloody battles, it is truly shocking to heaven and earth and moving to gods. Our country has this wall of flesh and blood, and we are even more confident that we can achieve final victory. I believe that during this period of resistance, the whole country should urgently "mobilize its spirit, organize the people, and train the people," which is the top priority. He believes that the government must become one with the people in order to generate great strength. He advocates that university students, in addition to science and engineering students who should focus on the manufacture of military supplies, the remaining liberal arts students should go deep into the countryside to undertake the work of training the people. Regarding general propaganda methods, Li said that in addition to newspapers and magazines, drama and lectures are especially important. When reporters asked about the situation of the Guangxi army's expedition, Li smiled and said, "I feel deeply ashamed that I was unable to quickly dispatch troops this time, but it was also due to inconvenient transportation." When the standing army of Guangxi Province received the conscription order, several regiments were stationed in Guilin and Binzhou, and the rest were engaged in mining and road construction. After receiving the order, all were excited and enthusiastic. When fathers and brothers learned that their children were going on an expedition, they regarded it as the highest honor. Even peasant women showed no reluctance at the time of parting, but repeatedly instructed their husbands to swear to kill the enemy. Li then said to reporters that Guangxi has been training young men for years and can now mobilize more than two million. Although the enemy is stubborn, our sincere and united will is enough to sweep away its fierce flames. Recently, enemy planes have been wantonly bombing various places, which has further strengthened our people's determination to hate the enemy and share the same hatred. Soldiers are fighting bloody battles on the battlefield and sacrificing their lives to defend the motherland, which is truly called dying in the right place. As a soldier, I will soon return to the front and vow to fight to the death with the Japanese." Li's attitude was extremely firm when he spoke. He talked for about an hour before leaving.

<h3>The Most Cruel and Barbaric Enemy Forces Bomb From the Sky</h3>
<p>150 Enemy Planes Drop Heavy Bombs; Their Cruelty Has Never Been Seen Even During the World War; Zhenru Town and the Railway Station Are Razed to the Ground</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that yesterday (the 26th) morning and afternoon, Japanese planes carried out the most cruel, barbaric, and unrestrained aerial bombardment in world history at Dachang and Nanxiang. Dozens of Japanese navy and army bombers, with no resistance in the sky, dropped hundreds of heavy bombs on the Chinese army, who were bravely resisting the advance of the Japanese mechanized infantry. According to foreign observers, the total number of Japanese planes was over 150, consisting of various types of army and navy bombers. They advanced in batches from airfields less than 15 miles away. Observers counted as many as 50 bombers in the sky at one time, each dropping six to eight bombs. Such fierce aerial bombardment has never been seen in the World War. At the Alidi and Bellre Forest, there were once 80 German planes flying over the two locations at dawn, but the number of bombers was always less than 20, with the rest being fighter planes used to defend against enemy planes. In that case, the number of enemy planes in the sky was also large. In this type of attack, German planes often lost 10 to 15 planes and often failed to drop all the bombs they were carrying in order to bomb enemy troops and their positions. Often they had been driven away before they could even fly over. During the World War, aerial bombing activities were not widely applied to enemy military positions, or at least not as fiercely as yesterday at Dachang and Nanxiang. Moreover, the bombs used by bombers in the World War were far smaller than those carried by bombers today, and the focus was on the enemy's accumulation of ammunition and military supplies, with enemy military positions being secondary. Yesterday, the Japanese planes concentrated all their bombing on the Chinese military positions, and the number of heavy bombs they dropped was countless, only that the quantity was extremely large. Yesterday afternoon, the Japanese naval spokesman, when meeting with news reporters, admitted that army and navy planes yesterday had co-operated and bombed these two locations.</p>
<p>The English Great America Evening News reported that a large squadron of Japanese planes, numbering about 150, dropped bombs and bombed Zhenru this morning (the 27th), Zhenru Town and the railway station have been razed to the ground.</p>

<h3>Enemy Reinforcements Arrive Again, Over Three Thousand Strong</h3>

<h3>Large Detachment of Our Troops Assists British Soldiers in Caring for Refugees</h3>
<p>Also Assists in Building Sandbag Defenses</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that this morning (the 27th), thousands of refugees, supporting the elderly and carrying the young, fled south along the railway. Some tried to force their way through the British soldiers' defense line and into the concession. The British soldiers were busy reinforcing their defenses to prevent the refugees from swarming in. At that time, a large detachment of Chinese soldiers on the railway saw the British soldiers' difficulties and immediately crossed the railway line to assist the British soldiers in suppressing the refugees, directing them to move south along the tracks. They also helped the British soldiers lift sandbags to increase the height of the defenses. Although the Chinese soldiers appeared exhausted, they showed no signs of discouragement, and their attitude towards the British soldiers was very friendly.</p>

<h3>Japan Formally Submits Reply Refusing to Participate in Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>Denies League of Nations' Condemnation of Aggression, Claims Self-Defense; Believes Convening the Conference Will Only Increase Complications</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Cabinet today refused to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference scheduled to be convened in Brussels in November. Foreign Minister Hirota met with Belgian Ambassador Baron de Bassompierre at 6:40 PM today and personally delivered Japan's reply refusing to participate. The reply, approximately eight hundred words in length, begins by denying the League of Nations' declaration of the 6th of this month condemning Japan for violating the Nine-Power Treaty. It then reiterates that "all actions taken by Japan in China are solely self-defense measures in response to China's forceful anti-Japanese policies, especially China's acts of provocation involving the use of force. Therefore, Japan's actions are not within the scope of the Nine-Power Treaty." The reply further states that since the League of Nations has previously guaranteed moral assistance to China and advocated that member states should avoid any actions that could reduce China's ability to resist, "the Imperial Government cannot help but believe that the convening of this conference is linked to the League of Nations' resolution, and feels that open discussions with the aim of achieving a fair and realistic resolution of the Sino-Japanese conflict are impossible." It also states, "The Imperial Government deeply believes that the participating countries in the conference have varying degrees of interests in East Asia, and some have no interests to speak of. If they gather together, the result will only increase the complications of the situation and obstruct a fair and appropriate resolution. For the above reasons, the Empire deeply regrets its inability to participate." The Japanese reply further states that the urgent task to be resolved today is for the Chinese government to realize that China and Japan have a shared responsibility for the stability of East Asia, and to change its attitude and policy so that the two countries can engage in cooperation. The Japanese reply also requests that all countries deeply understand this need. (Central News Agency, 27th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo Authorities' Declaration</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the Japanese authorities today issued a lengthy declaration of two thousand words, stating, "Japan, with a tolerant attitude, has strived to promote goodwill in China. Unexpectedly, China lacked the ability to appreciate this and instead engaged in provocative behavior against Japan, forcing Japan to resort to war for self-defense." The declaration also condemns the League of Nations' actions after the Manchurian Incident, stating that they fueled China's anti-Japanese policies, and claiming that it is repeating its mistakes today. The declaration continues, stating that it is foreseeable that the majority of the countries participating in the conference will be bound by the League of Nations' resolution, and therefore Japan had no choice but to decide to refuse to participate in this conference. "If all countries could understand Japan's true intentions earlier and take appropriate steps to make the Nanjing government change its attitude and policy, then a path could be opened between Japan and other countries to seek a resolution to the current situation."

<p>[Paris] The chief US representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Norman Davis, disembarked in Le Havre, France, after traveling by ship from New York.

<p>[London] Norman Davis arrived in Plymouth today and told a Reuters reporter, "I dare not predict the outcome of the Brussels Conference. I hope Japan can join this meeting to study whether we can find a constructive solution to the very difficult problems in the Far East." It is heard that the issue of inviting Germany and the Soviet Union to join the conference will be decided soon. Some countries have not yet expressed their agreement, so a decision must wait until their agreement is obtained. (Central News Agency, 26th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] During the debate in the House of Lords yesterday on the address in reply to the King's Speech, the Lord Privy Seal, Viscount Halifax, responding to a question from a Member of Parliament, said that the policy that Britain intends to pursue in the Nine-Power Conference is nothing more than to end the Sino-Japanese conflict on a basis that is acceptable to world moral sentiment. This will be a foundation for contributing to lasting hope and a basis on which all parties can participate to seek China's development. The government had previously stated in Parliament that the people should know the policy and objectives of the government's attendance at the Brussels Conference, but beyond that, he could not say much at this time. (Central News Agency, 27th, Reuters dispatch) ⊙Brussels: The Belgian Foreign Ministry will issue a statement tomorrow regarding whether to invite Russia and Germany to send representatives to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference.

<h3>British House of Commons Debates Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Labor Party Accuses Government of Weakness and Procrastination; Liberal Party Insists on Cooperation Between Britain and the United States</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons began debating the address in reply to the King's Speech today. Labor Party leader Clement Attlee spoke, asking the government to express its Far East policy slightly, saying that the government has repeatedly said that it will continue to work with other governments to reduce the suffering caused by the Sino-Japanese conflict and to bring the Sino-Japanese conflict to an end. These words are good, but the important point is what kind of ending? Liberal Party leader Sir Archibald Sinclair spoke of the hope of achieving a peaceful outcome from the Brussels Conference, saying, what kind of peace is this? This is a question that makes people uneasy. Are those who are loudly calling for peace Japan? Or are there other countries that are demanding peace on behalf of Japan, based on Japan's occupation of several provinces of China? The mover of the address in reply to the King's Speech was Conservative MP Mr. Balfour, and the seconder was Liberal MP Mr. Mallinson. Mr. Mallinson said that what the British people can consider most satisfactory is the US government's participation in the Nine-Power Conference. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon then spoke, outlining the trade cycle and the dangerous situation of plummeting prices, saying that there is no reason to say that British trade is gradually declining. The Labor Party stated that it will propose an amendment to the address, believing that the government's foreign policy is weak and procrastinating, and that it has no fundamental construction measures internally to improve the people's living standards and promote permanent economic prosperity, and has therefore lost the trust of the House of Commons, which is regrettable. (Central News Agency, 26th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Sir Archibald Sinclair, leader of the opposition Liberal Party, then spoke, reiterating the views he expressed on the 21st of this month, and insisted that Britain and the United States must cooperate. In addition, many other members of parliament spoke successively. The meeting had not adjourned by the time of the dispatch. (Central News Agency, 26th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Churchill Condemns Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>[London] Radical Conservative Party leader Winston Churchill recently gave a speech in Loughton, Essex, condemning Japan's aggression against China, advocating that Britain should act in concert with other countries that are determined to jointly deal with aggressor nations, and urgently demanding that the government expand the air force as much as possible. He said, "Japan has now fallen into the hands of warlords, who disregard the wishes of the people and experienced politicians and attack China in the hope of seizing the territory of this old country, and use its newly built air force to indiscriminately bomb large areas inhabited by Chinese civilians in the most cruel way, as a means of intimidation. Under these circumstances, Britain must cooperate with the United States and the League of Nations to deal with this, and should expand its armaments as much as possible, especially its air force."

<h3>Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Committee Drafts Resolution</h3>
<p>Abandoning Symbolic Withdrawal of Volunteers; Soviet Representative Expresses Strong Stance</p>
<p>[London] The Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Committee met for five hours yesterday, chaired by Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, and made considerable progress, resolving to abandon the proposal for the symbolic withdrawal of volunteers, directing the chairman and secretary to draft the terms of reference, and opening a list of two committees to be sent to Spain. The resolution drafted at the previous meeting regarding the method of withdrawal, granting belligerent rights to both sides, and reimposing land and sea surveillance was slightly revised and submitted to the governments. All representatives except the Soviet representative Maisky supported the resolution. The subcommittee will convene tomorrow morning to discuss the final form of the resolution. Maisky stated that the Soviet Union believes that the members of the committee should, without prior self-restraint, accept the individuals nominated to be sent to the committee in Spain as a basis. Maisky commented on the Italian government's official announcement that there are 40,000 Italian volunteers in Spain, saying that this should be rejected with a very firm attitude and can only be regarded as an attempt to put pressure on the committee. Maisky also said that the Soviet Union is prepared to do its utmost to unconditionally support the policy of immediately and completely withdrawing foreign fighters from Spain. However, he said that the replies from Italy and Germany are vague and that Italian reinforcements are still arriving at General Franco's side. Three legions landed in Cadiz a few days ago. The Soviet Union cannot change its opinion on the issue of linking the granting of belligerent rights to both sides with the withdrawal of foreign fighters. The Soviet Union must wait until the foreign fighters have completely withdrawn before it can consider the issue of belligerent rights. If most of the foreign fighters have withdrawn, and reinforcements are no longer arriving to support the rebels, and the governments are truly sincere in ceasing all interference in Spanish affairs, then the Soviet Union may agree to consider the issue of granting belligerent rights. However, the Soviet Union reserves the right to decide when it can make this consideration. The Soviet Union reiterated its opinion that monitoring the Spanish land and sea borders is interdependent and should be the entire problem. The Soviet Union believes that restoring and consolidating the monitoring of the Spanish borders should be carried out simultaneously with consolidating maritime monitoring.

<h3>Soviet Union Resolves to Fully Defend Its Far Eastern Territories</h3>
<p>Border Defenses Solid Enough to Resist Enemy Invasion; Nationwide Celebration of the Anniversary of the Recovery of Vladivostok</p>
<p>[Moscow] Fifteen years ago, on this day, the People's Revolutionary Army of the Far Eastern Republic occupied Vladivostok, drove out the Japanese interventionist forces and White Guards, and completely liberated the Soviet Maritime Province. Today, all newspapers have published articles to commemorate this event, including essays and memoirs. The editorial of Izvestia stated, "In the autumn of 1922, the fully armed interventionists were attempting to maintain the Maritime Province and prolong the civil war. However, after the final bloody battle, the People's Revolutionary Army finally dealt them a fatal blow. Under the command of General Blucher, the Revolutionary Army valiantly defended the country, crushed the last remnants of the White Guards, and forced the Japanese army to withdraw from the Maritime Province, withdrawing from Vladivostok without a fight. Three years later, it drove the Japanese imperialists out of Kuye Island and Kamchatka, laying the foundation for the revival of the Far East and the development of its great productive forces. Since 1931, after occupying Manchuria, the Japanese warlords have constantly openly threatened the Soviet Far Eastern region, dreaming of occupying its abundant natural resources. At the same time, the German and Japanese fascist running dogs, the Trotskyites, Zinovievites, and Bukharinites, have colluded with the enemy, attempting to carve up the Far Eastern region and destroy its economic and cultural facilities. However, this kind of obstruction cannot limit the victorious construction work on the Pacific coast and the Amur River. Under the command of the same Marshal Blucher, the glorious Far Eastern Red Banner Army has severely punished all interventionist wreckers. The people have used cement and steel to make the Far Eastern border an impregnable wall, which no enemy can invade. All spies and sabotage teams operating in that area cannot escape our eyes and ears and will be captured and eliminated. The Far Eastern region is an indivisible part of our country, and we will never give up a single bit. The entire country, the entire party, and its Central Committee and Stalin himself pay close attention to the prosperity and development of the Far Eastern region. The vast desolate area has now seen the rise of amazing cities such as Komsomolsk, and old towns such as Khabarovsk and Vladivostok have been completely transformed after construction. The fish produced in the Far East is enough to supply the entire country, and the gold produced occupies an important position in the country. The border area, which had no industry at all in the Tsarist era, now produces large quantities of oil, coal, zinc, copper, wood, and builds ships, machine tools, etc. Tens of thousands of tractors and combine harvesters are working on collective and state farms. Dozens of different ethnic groups in the region have been liberated from oppression and are participating in the development of the region, advancing towards the realm of socialist culture. The Red Army and the people, united, will do their best to defend its entire border, and no matter where the enemy comes from, whether it be land, sea, or air, there is no hope of invading our territory."

<h3>Interview from the Front Lines (Continued)</h3>
<p>Western Railway Station Employees Remain Calm; Iron Manure Cart Serves as a Makeshift Tank</p>
<p>Due to the movement of our military's right flank—from Zhabei, Jiangwan, Miaohang, and up to Dachang—one cannot help but notice the western part of Shanghai. Yesterday around noon, this reporter, along with colleagues Mr. Jin and Mr. Zhang, drove directly to the railway bridgehead at the western end of the extraterritorial road, Jessfield Road. To the west of the railway was the avenue leading directly to Beixinjing. To the east of the road, numerous British army personnel and detective constables were stationed. Upon our arrival, we saw a large number of refugees, carrying boxes and luggage, supporting the elderly and leading the young, fleeing south from the north bank of the Suzhou Creek toward the railway bridge. The scene of misery was truly a picture of people displaced on the road. However, the most admirable sight at that time was the British army personnel stationed there, who were doing their utmost to protect and rescue all the refugees. Among them, especially, Chinese constable No. 1222, a British sergeant acting as a search party leader, and a large man in plain clothes, went back and forth across the 40-odd-meter railway bridge, carrying women, children, the elderly, and the weak to the south side of the bridge, doing so more than a hundred times. Such great spirit almost moved one to tears. Upon inquiring about their names, it was learned that the Chinese constable was named Yan Bingheng, and the large man in plain clothes was Wang Jinsheng, a detective from the constabulary. At that time, approximately forty enemy aircraft were soaring over the western part of Shanghai and the northern bank of the Suzhou Creek, reconnoitering and bombing at will.</p>
<p>At 1:20 PM, near the railway line about 300 meters north of the bridge, dense machine gun and mortar fire suddenly erupted. It was clear that the enemy's pursuing troops had made contact with our army. At this time, because the reporter was on the south bank and the sounds of gunfire and explosions were coming from the northern bank, it was assumed that the front line must be facing off on the east and west sides near the railway line. With the exception of stray bullets, there should be no other danger, so I could not bear to leave immediately. Instead, I rushed to the Fanwangdu Railway Station to report to the office via telephone. At that time, the stationmaster and staff were calm and working as usual. Simultaneously, five enemy aircraft had flown over the station. The stationmaster pointed to the reporter and said, "This place is a target for enemy aircraft. Aren't you afraid of the danger?" The reporter replied, "You are here all day long. Aren't you in danger?" The stationmaster said, "We are responsible for our duties, and we cannot leave without authorization." The reporter said, "I am also here because of my duties. How can I not come?" They then laughed together and parted ways. Fortunately, the enemy aircraft did not drop bombs at that time. The reporter then returned to the railway bridgehead and stood on the side of Kaixuan Road. It was already 2:10 PM.</p>
<p>Kaixuan Road was only thirty meters from the railway bridge, running parallel to the railway line. The reporter was gazing north when, in less than five minutes, intense machine gun fire suddenly erupted near the north of the bridge, and bullets flew straight towards the south of Zhabei like locusts. At the same time, the sound of light machine gun fire returning fire came from the weeds on the west side of Kaixuan Road, just a few feet away from the reporter. At this time, the British soldiers stationed on the south side of the bridge and the Chinese and foreigners standing on the side of the road all lay prone in the nearby ditches or sought refuge under cars. The reporter hurriedly took refuge behind a sanitation bureau manure cart on the side of the road. The manure cart was made of iron and served as a temporary shield, functioning much like a tank, albeit with a slightly unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>The gunfire grew denser and closer. Bullets whizzed past overhead, and a cream-colored car nearby could be heard being hit with a "thud."</p>
<p>The driver, Afang, also knew the danger and was so frightened that his face turned ashen. He lay prone in a ditch near the reporter. The reporter hurriedly called him to get in the car and start the engine. The reporter then fearlessly jumped onto the running board and fled south at full speed. When the car reached the vicinity of the West Railway Station (about a hundred meters from the northern end of Kaixuan Road to the West Railway Station), the reporter thought of Mr. Jin and Mr. Zhang, who were still trapped in the center of the firing line. If I escaped alone and something unfortunate happened to them, I would feel guilty. So I ordered the car to turn around. Unexpectedly, just as the car turned north, a bullet whizzed past the upper left corner of the car with a "zing" sound, as if telling me, "Since you have escaped, why do you want to go back to seek death?" Afang then turned the car around and headed south and east, stopping temporarily at the intersection of Yuyuan Road.</p>
<p>In less than a quarter of an hour, Mr. Jin arrived in a car driven by a foreigner. At that moment, the crowd on the side of the road suddenly began to applaud towards the western sky. Mr. Jin and I turned around to look, and haha, two of the enemy's aircraft had been hit by our anti-aircraft guns. One caught fire and fell, and the two pilots jumped out with parachutes. The other did not catch fire but somersaulted several times irregularly in the air and fell vertically. Presumably, it was putting on one last performance. Before long, Mr. Zhang also arrived. Then, a friend in a suit who had been standing on the south side of the railway bridge also arrived. He said that just now, two women on the side of the road had been struck, one dead and one injured. The three of us looked at each other in stunned silence and then got into the car and returned to the office.</p>
<p>It is common for news reporters to go to the front lines to report on news, hear artillery fire, and encounter aircraft. However, being caught in the middle of a machine gun crossfire between two sides is probably not very common.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Three Representatives to Pay Attention to the Fact that the Japanese Violated the Treaty</h3>
<p>Not Only Focus on Current Facts, But Also Seek the Effective Implementation of the Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the three Chinese representatives attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Gu, Guo, and Qian, yesterday, saying, "To representatives Gu, Guo, and Qian of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference: The Japanese have been destroying the Nine-Power Treaty for six years. This conference should focus on the consistent drama of treaty violations over the past six years and seek ways to remedy the situation. It should not only focus on the current events and should also request effective measures to ensure the effective implementation of the Nine-Power Treaty, so as to avoid empty words being of no help. You are all senior members of the diplomatic arena, and the people of the country are looking up to you. We humbly offer these suggestions and ask that you adopt them."</p>
<h3>The Tide of Economic Severance Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>India Publishes a Special Issue; Citizens Continue Their Efforts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Self-Government Association recently received a letter from the editor of Pro'amitra in Madras, India, translated as follows: "The people of India, in view of Japan's concentrated aggression in China, although its power is strong and fierce, express immeasurable admiration for your country's heroic resistance. We are willing to do everything in our power to help your country fight for freedom. We believe that there is no other way than to boycott Japanese goods. Therefore, Mr. Jwhaslal Nehru, the speaker of our parliament, has given us leadership in order to seek the support of the masses for the boycott plan. Our published weekly intends to publish a special issue on the 26th. We would be very grateful if you could provide us with news, which would allow people here to realize our obligations to your country and all mankind. Therefore, we urgently hope to receive some news from airmail or telegrams before the 24th."</p>
<p>Sever All Relations with the Enemy</p>
<p>The Municipal National Economic Severance Committee with Japan issued a notice to all organizations yesterday stating that, according to the resolution of the committee's first executive committee meeting, all organizations in the city were requested to inform their members not to work for enemy commercial and industrial institutions or families, not to use enemy warehouses, not to use enemy ships, and not to use enemy currency or have any economic relations with enemy banks. Correspondingly, they were requested to comply accordingly.</p>
<p>Strictly Enforce the Exposure of Enemy Goods</p>
<p>The Citizens' United Association of the Second Special District of this city has stipulated four points for cracking down on enemy goods and has made recommendations to the Economic Severance Committee. The recommended measures of the association are recorded as follows: (1) First-tier merchants and trading houses are prohibited from importing enemy goods in the future. All existing inventory must be registered with the Economic Severance Committee immediately and sold off. (2) All industries in the same trade should provide joint guarantees not to import enemy goods. If anyone is found to be privately importing enemy goods and is not reported, the guarantors must be jointly responsible. (3) If employees in the industry discover that the owner or manager is privately importing enemy goods after registration, they may report it at any time. The confidentiality of the reporter will be maintained. (4) All private imports of enemy goods by second-tier and third-tier merchants must be handled in the same way as stipulated above.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Requests Pawnbrokers to Exchange Gold and Silver for Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Since Pawned Items Must Be Sold, It is Better to Directly Exchange Them for Cash</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Pawnbrokers' Association yesterday stating that since full-term gold and silver jewelry must be sold by pawnbrokers anyway, it is better to exchange them directly for legal tender at national banks, which is simpler and more convenient. Please take note and handle accordingly.</p>
<h3>Citizens are Actively Planning to Promote the Solicitation of Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Women's Groups and the Social Affairs Bureau Collaborate to Promote and Advocate</p>
<p>The National Salvation Public Bond is not only a concentration of national financial resources, but most importantly, it has a great educational significance in making the national public aware of the meaning of the National Salvation Public Bond and their concern for the long-term war of resistance. Therefore, the women's group specially requested the Social Affairs Bureau to order all principals to lead publicity and solicitation, so that every child can understand and publicize to every family. It is heard that the women's group and the Social Affairs Bureau have agreed on mutual promotion methods and have scheduled to invite all principals for the first discussion tomorrow.</p>
<p>Machinery and Dyeing Industry Acknowledges 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Machinery and Dyeing Industry Association began soliciting National Salvation Public Bonds, its work has been quite diligent. The amount subscribed by the industry has been around 100,000 yuan. As of the 26th of this month, the actual collected amount was 77,328 yuan.</p>
<p>Tenants Implement the Purchase of Public Bonds</p>
<p>Since the issuance of National Salvation Public Bonds, the tenants of Juyuanfang on Fujian Road in this port believe that the number of bonds solicited should be centered on Shanghai. Therefore, the Shanghai Solicitation General and Sub-Teams place a heavy burden on the commercial bourgeoisie. At the beginning of the month, it was reported that the tenants would pay one month's rent to obtain a receipt from the bank receiving the National Salvation Public Bond to offset the rent. This method is now being implemented in order. Due to the impact of the war, many tenants in this neighborhood have accumulated arrears in rent. With the previous arrears not yet cleared, it is now difficult to ask each tenant to use one month's rent to urge the landlord to purchase bonds. However, the country has decided that matters related to the national salvation fund should take precedence over private matters. Each tenant must first use one month's rent to purchase National Salvation Public Bonds and use the receipt to offset the rent. As for previous arrears, the tenants will settle them with the landlords themselves.</p>
<h3>The Public Concession is Not Affected by the War Situation</h3>
<p>Statement by the Chairman of the Municipal Council: Urging Residents Not to Lightly Believe Rumors</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, told a Central News Agency reporter yesterday (the 27th) afternoon, "Although there have been changes in the war situation in this city, the area of the Public Concession south of the Suzhou Creek and east of the railway line is not affected in the slightest. The maintenance of law and order and the administration of the Concession are also not hindered. The Concession authorities have already taken measures to prevent anything that might interfere with the administration of the Concession. At present, there are many rumors, and we earnestly hope that the residents of the Concession will not lightly believe them."</p>
<h3>Closely Monitor Various Donations</h3>
<p>The Second Special District United Association Sends Letters to Various Public Organizations</p>
<p>The Citizens' United Association of the Second Special District of this city sent letters to various public organizations yesterday, saying, "According to the suggestion of Committee Member Qu Zhenhua of this association, we are requesting that the government promptly formulate emergency laws for the punishment of crimes during this extraordinary period. If anyone involved in the solicitation of national salvation donations, relief donations, comfort donations, medical donations, and all other donations, including fundraisers, staff members, and various fundraising organizations, is found to have engaged in embezzlement, misappropriation of donations, or directly or indirectly engaged in activities to come to terms with the enemy, they must be sentenced to death once discovered. All accomplices involved in the collusion must also be jointly responsible and punished with the same penalties in order to deter others and uphold the law. After discussion, the association believes that embezzlement of donations not only damages the country's financial resources but also provides excellent material for enemy propaganda, which has a very large impact on the future of the war of resistance. In addition to forwarding the proposed measures to the government for consideration and implementation, we correspondingly request your association to closely monitor fundraising organizations and donation solicitors in order to prevent malpractices. We extend our public friendship."</p>
<h3>Guo Moruo, Tian Han, and Others Extend Regards to the Troops</h3>
<p>A Certain Army Commander Acknowledges the Front Line; Withdrawal Does Not Affect the Overall Situation</p>
<p>Guo Moruo, Tian Han, and others went to the front lines on the 24th to extend regards to the troops and returned yesterday. Mr. Guo and others met with General ×××, the commander of the ××th Army, in ××, the front line. They conveyed the condolences and respect of the people in the rear. According to Mr. Guo, the officers and soldiers on the front lines were extremely excited and had the same determination to sacrifice themselves to kill the enemy and save the country. The × Army Commander believes that the retreat on our front line does not affect the overall situation.</p>
<h3>Nine-Year-Old Girl Donates Binoculars</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Comfort Association received a donation yesterday from Ms. Wei Guo, the nine-year-old daughter of Mr. Pu Qiting, through the China &amp; South Sea Bank. She was taught by her parents and teachers to use more than 300 yuan of her savings over the years to purchase three military binoculars, which she presented to General Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan, and Feng Yuxiang to help them kill the enemy and recover the country's territory. The association has now forwarded the binoculars.</p>
<h3>The Mongol Road Rescue Team Sheds Tears as it Withdraws from Zhabei</h3>
<p>In the Future, We Will Continue to Uphold the Spirit of the Past and Reorganize to Continue Our Work</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, Mr. Xu Junjie, the principal of the Gongyi Primary School in the Gongyi Li neighborhood of Mongol Road in Zhabei, contacted the local people to organize the Mongol Road Rescue Team, which specializes in entering and exiting the fire lines of Zhabei and Jiangwan to rescue wounded soldiers. They have been working diligently in a dedicated spirit. Up to now, they have rescued more than ××× wounded soldiers. The school building has been used as an emergency station, and the Shanghai Branch of the Red Cross Society has allocated medicines and assisted with the transportation work. I did not believe it the night before, until I rescued six wounded soldiers at 10 PM. At 1 AM yesterday morning, I rescued another wounded soldier, and the Shanghai Branch of the Red Cross Society sent a car to transport him with great effort. It was not until 7 AM yesterday morning that they were forced to withdraw. All documents and record books were not carried. They withdrew to a Red Cross stationed team site somewhere. According to Mr. Xu, the team leader, the team members have entered and exited the hail of bullets hundreds of times. Fortunately, since the start of the work, no one has been injured or killed. Only a team member surnamed Wang was injured in the leg by falling debris from a bombed house while on duty. What remains as a memorial now is only a handful of injury tickets and three receipts from the Municipal Branch of the Red Cross Society. After this disaster, we will uphold the spirit of the past, reorganize, and plan to work in the rear.</p>
<h3>The International Red Cross Society Establishes a Wounded Soldiers' Hospital</h3>
<p>Twelve Wounded Soldiers' Hospitals Rescue Refugees in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>The International Red Cross Society, organized by Chinese and foreign philanthropists and consuls from various countries, has been working hard since its establishment with the task of rescuing wounded soldiers and accommodating Chinese and foreign refugees. For convenience, it has used the Zhongshan Hospital in Fenglinqiao to form two hospitals, the First and Second Wounded Soldiers' and Refugees' Hospitals, with Todd as the director of the First Hospital and Parsons as the director of the Second Hospital. The doctors and nurses in between are mostly foreigners and Catholic women. They have already accommodated many wounded soldiers and Chinese and Western poor and sick refugees. Mr. Col Dewatteollle, the representative of the International Red Cross Society in Geneva, notified the military bureaus of both China and Japan to pay special attention. A meeting was held at the International Hotel yesterday to discuss the funding and relief issues, and it was proposed to request a large sum of money from the Ministry of Finance for advocacy. They are also starting to organize refugee shelters to accommodate local and foreign refugees in Shanghai, with special attention to Russian penniless poor people.</p>
<p>After our army shifted westward due to strategic reasons yesterday, refugees in Zhabei and western Shanghai moved to the Caojiadu area. The scene of supporting the elderly and leading the young on the way was tragic and unbearable. Mr. Cai Futang, the chairman of the 12th Wounded Soldiers' Hospital, personally went to the western district police station to coordinate relief efforts. The authorities expressed deep sympathy and, along with an Italian interpreter, negotiated with the Italian military headquarters and obtained their permission. Mr. Cai then, along with his colleagues Jiang Baochu and Ge Baohua, rescued more than a thousand men and women and sent them to various shelters for relief.</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society's rescue team, as the front-line war was pressing, still increased vehicles and the whole team set out in separate routes the night before. In Zhongshan Road and Zhoujiaqiao, they rescued a total of 106 wounded soldiers and sent them to various hospitals for treatment.</p>
<h3>The Yuchiaqing Road Bridge Was Closed Off Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Vehicles, Horses, and Pedestrians Are Not Allowed to Pass</p>
<p>Starting at 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the Yuchiaqing Road Bridge was closed off. All vehicles, horses, pedestrians, and firefighters were not allowed to pass.</p>
<h3>Huang Ren Zhi Leaves Shanghai for Suzhou</h3>
<p>Returns to Suzhou After a Week</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Ren Zhi of the Shanghai Local Self-Government Association left for Suzhou by car late last night (the 27th) due to official business. After a brief stay, he will depart from Suzhou to travel directly to the capital for further discussions. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai after a week.</p>
<h3>Hoping for Prompt Donations of Urgently Needed Supplies for the Front Lines</h3>
<p>In the full-scale war of resistance, there is a huge need for gauze bandages, barbed wire, and bicycles. In addition, the weather is getting colder, and cotton vests are urgently needed. Although the medical first-aid kits have been donated by various parties, they are still insufficient after being claimed by various military branches. It is necessary to request that all sectors donate more. For the style of cotton vests, you can obtain them from the Shanghai Local Self-Government Association of the Comfort Association or the general and branch stores of the China &amp; West Drug Store. First-aid kits can also be purchased from pharmacies, costing one dime per kit. Reception points for comfort items: Yuchiaqing Road Municipal Chamber of Commerce Comfort Association, Local Self-Government Association in the China &amp; South Sea Bank Building, Lintuh An Shujin Li Cotton Cloth Association on Guling Road, East Silk Crepe Association on Shiludong Beijing Road.</p>
<h3>Two Scouts Are Still Missing</h3>
<p>Martyred Drivers and Laborers Will Be Given Pensions to Their Families</p>
<p>Scouts Chen Xingsun and others were injured while rescuing wounded soldiers at the front lines the day before yesterday. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Chen Xingsun is recovering quite well from treatment. However, the two scouts who were with him, Chen Yingqian and Xu Jianlai, are still missing and are feared dead. Among those who were killed by the bombing at the time were the driver Cao Huifeng and the laborer Weng Fugen. It is reported that the rescue committee has already provided the families of each of the deceased with 150 yuan for funeral expenses and will provide each with a pension of 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Maternity Hospital for Refugees Seeks Donations of Infant Clothing</h3>
<p>The Refugee Maternity Hospital, organized by the China Hospital at the entrance of Yiyuan Lane, Xinzha Road, and the Hongkou People's Maternity Hospital, is completely non-profit. All refugee mothers are admitted to the hospital and provided with medical care free of charge. However, the newborn infants of refugee mothers often lack small clothes and diapers. The hospital's funding does not come from external sources, so it has not been able to prepare adequately. It is hoped that kind-hearted people will see this and generously donate to help the refugee infants. The infants of the refugees will be greatly grateful.</p>
<h3>Report from the Fire Brigade of the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Most Incidents Occur in Western Shanghai; Fire Engines Have Been Dispatched Eight Times</p>
<p>The lookouts of the Fire Brigade of the Municipal Council reported seventeen fires yesterday (the 26th), all of which occurred in the war zone. Ambulances were dispatched twenty times, taking a total of twenty patients and injured to various hospitals, seven of whom were injured by stray bullets. Most of the incidents occurred near Zhaofeng Garden in western Shanghai. Fire engines were dispatched eight times, the highest number in recent days.</p>
<h3>Eternally Unforgettable Ferry Crossing at the Brahma Temple</h3>
<p>— Zhang Changren</p>
<p>The Honorable British Soldiers</p>
<p>Following the southward withdrawal of our army from Dazhang, the defending troops of Jiangwan and Zhabei received orders last night at ten o'clock to retreat, moving the entire division towards western Shanghai under the cover of a single attack. Is this the result of our main force being defeated on the battlefield? No! I believe that anyone with a basic understanding of warfare will know that this is merely to adapt to a certain strategy during the overall war of resistance, avoiding unnecessary and significant sacrifices. Some believe that our army will abandon Greater Shanghai, but that is an unfounded worry. Our army will not allow the entire Greater Shanghai to fall into enemy hands unless it is absolutely necessary to abandon it. Military authorities have expressed their determination to secure western Shanghai and the southern city.</p>
<p>To understand the actual situation in western Shanghai, yesterday afternoon at around one o'clock, after inspecting the situation on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek and gazing at the entire Zhabei area, which resembled a large furnace spewing fierce flames, with black smoke and tongues of fire angrily licking the blue autumn sky, I headed west through the bustling civilian market of Caojiadu to inspect the area around the Brahma Temple ferry crossing.</p>
<p>Caojiadu was guarded by troops from Germany. The sandbag fortifications along the road were neatly stacked, as if sculpted, lying beautifully on the ground. Squads of soldiers moved through the crowds. However, the city police still maintained order and directed traffic on the streets. The only difference was that the relatively stable city situation, which had been gradually stabilizing for more than a month, seemed slightly more chaotic; the most noticeable change was the line of refugees coming towards us.</p>
<p>The car stopped at the northern end of Avenue Joffre. I walked along the quiet Suzhou Creek, through the barbed wire placed on the road, towards the Brahma Temple iron bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. The gate at the railway crossing was managed by several British soldiers, who continuously allowed refugees seeking to enter the road construction zone outside the concession to squeeze through the gaps in the gate. Although they held whips, they used them to direct traffic. Three or four foreign photographers, some using box cameras and others using motion picture cameras, were outside the gate capturing the tragic scene of refugees supporting the old and leading the young, carrying burdens on their shoulders, and wandering about in disorder.</p>
<p>These refugees were mostly residents of villages in the triangular area between Dazhang, Zhabei, and Zhenru, survivors of over seventy days of enemy air raids. Perhaps it was too unexpected, or perhaps the scene ahead was too terrifying, that whether they had walked seven miles or one or two miles, they all appeared extremely exhausted, their clothes disheveled, and their faces pale. Most of them were walking with difficulty, stumbling along the way. Their faces were pale, and their eyes had lost their spirit, the peaceful and simple light that was usually present in the eyes of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>I walked onto the pedestrian walkway on the east side of the iron bridge (now the northern end is blocked) and looked out over the undulating fields north of the Suzhou Creek. The autumn sun was as bright and warm as the spring sun, and the suburban scenery remained the same. However, on every village road leading to the iron bridge, there was only a dense black line of compatriots fleeing to safety, crawling south like ants. At this time, sporadic gunfire could be heard in the distance, occasionally accompanied by the explosion of one or two small artillery shells. Enemy planes flew low in the not-so-distant sky in groups, their flying posture seemingly boasting that this time, our army's voluntary temporary retreat would be recorded in their book of achievements.</p>
<p>Most refugees seemed about to faint as they reached the northern end of the iron bridge, but they still struggled to step over the railway ties with great difficulty. The steps of the elderly women and children were not long enough to span the distance between the ties, so they fell, crawled, shouted, and cried, which could be described as the epitome of human suffering. Any human being, except for the cold-blooded "executioners" of Japan, namely the Japanese air force that bombed civilians and undefended cities, would naturally feel sympathy.</p>
<p>Ah! I have never felt such goodwill towards British soldiers. They rolled up their sleeves and used their strong, hairy arms to carry one or two frightened, crying children and support or carry frail old women or women unable to walk across the bridge from the other side, time after time. They carried loads of clothing or rice for the refugees across the bridge. They sweated and worked tirelessly, and during the two hours I was there, they always helped the refugees as sincerely as if they were their own families. I personally saw refugees shedding tears of gratitude towards them, and I personally heard the refugees express their heartfelt thanks. I know that although they did not understand the words, they were not hoping for expressions of gratitude. For the first time, I saw true "humanity" - their spirit of prioritizing helping others was truly admirable!</p>
<p>Police Constable Number 1222 (later I learned his name was Yan Bingheng) was also one of the most helpful, and he was the only Chinese person on the bridge. He devoted almost all his strength to helping the refugees. He said, "I don't have money to donate to the country, but I should use my strength to help others." He was a young, strong man from the north. I shook his hand, with the same respect I had for the British soldiers.</p>
<p>After crossing the iron bridge, most of the refugees went west along the Suzhou Creek. I don't know where their destination was. Perhaps they were seeking a safer place in the future battlefield, or perhaps they were going south along the railway line. However, I could not advise every refugee.</p>
<p>The Japanese air force continued to bomb the refugees. I bandaged the wound of a thirteen- or fourteen-year-old girl. A large piece of her upper arm had been cut away by shrapnel. She only wanted to escape and forgot about the pain, forgetting to stop the bleeding. I couldn't find a bandage for a moment, but the wife of a foreign photographer next to me generously offered a clean, ginger-scented handkerchief, which I used my common sense to tie tightly to stop the bleeding. Another elderly man in his fifties had been shot in the forehead by a Japanese soldier, and an American soldier helped him into his ambulance and drove away.</p>
<p>At this moment, the battle at the Brahma Temple ferry crossing began. Behind a high ground not far north of the railway bridge, the crisp, continuous sound of automatic rifles suddenly rang out. The target was aimed at us – the British soldiers, the Chinese constable, and the refugees – on the south bank. This surprised the British soldiers on the bridge. We disregarded the many men, women, old, and young refugees who were paralyzed and sitting on the ground, and first hurriedly sought a hiding place. However, there were fields all around us, so we, two British soldiers, and the photographer's wife all fell into the ditch by the side of the road. It was very shallow, so we had to press our chests and faces tightly against the slope of the ditch. The British soldiers also loaded their rifles, ready to fire if necessary. The other side of the railway on the north bank immediately retaliated with the same gunfire. We were caught in the center of the line of fire.</p>
<p>The enemy's bullets "flew—" "flew—" over our heads. Perhaps they were too high, or perhaps I didn't hold up my target well enough, but I was lucky enough not to be "stimulated." However, I had to leave; I couldn't determine how long this battle would last. Eventually, I had to take advantage of a pause in the enemy's gunfire and flee towards the Brahma Temple station, seeking cover along the way. As I hid on the side of a cream-colored car, I felt that the car had taken several bullets. If it weren't for that car, perhaps the enemy's two bullets wouldn't have been wasted?</p>
<p>The first cover I found was at most two or three hundred meters from the other side. It wasn't until I reached Yuyuan Road that I felt a little safer.</p>
<p>On the way back (at 2:45), I was fortunate enough to see two enemy planes shot down alive. One fell completely to the ground, landing in our army's position in the direction of Beixinjing. The other fell completely to the ground, one exploded in the sky, the fuselage shattered, and the pilot slowly descended with a parachute into our army's position. If he didn't die, he might be a guest in Nanjing for a while!</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>From the First Line to the Second Line</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhonghua</p>
<p>Our army on the Shanghai-Songhu front retreated from the first line of defense to the second line the night before last. This retreat was mainly due to the destruction of the fortifications in Dazhang, leaving our frontline soldiers with no fortifications to defend, and the enemy forces advancing south from Zoumatang directly towards Zhenru posed a danger of cutting off the rear of our Jiangwan and Zhabei right-wing troops. Therefore, this was a strategic retreat, which cannot be said to be a serious defeat for our army, nor is it sufficient to affect the overall situation of our war of resistance. However, for two weeks, the general public has been closely concerned about the battle situation in Dazhang, and now suddenly hearing the news of the retreat, there must be those who cannot restrain their grief and indignation in terms of emotion; especially those who hope for victory too eagerly, suddenly heard yesterday that our army had moved west, and saw the flames of Zhabei soaring into the sky, perhaps in addition to grief and indignation, they could not help but feel a slight sense of disappointment. But we should point out that this feeling is absolutely impermissible. The war on the first line of Shanghai-Songhu for seventy-five days is the greatest success in the history of our country's war of resistance. We used a mere army to resist the enemy's four forces of sea, land, air, and mechanized troops, on a riverbank about ten kilometers deep and tens of kilometers long, containing more than a hundred enemy ships, 200,000 troops, and 350 naval and land aircraft for as long as two and a half months; no military strategist from any standpoint can fail to be amazed by the bravery of our soldiers! We believe that with this incomparably brave spirit, resisting the war on the second, third, or any line of defense, the result will inevitably be a greater success.</p>
<p>Moreover, from the perspective of the current overall battle situation, our main front of resistance is in North China, not in Shanghai. Shanghai is a place where our army and the enemy are engaged in attrition warfare. On this front, our biggest goal is to contain the enemy's massive military force and consume the enemy's unlimited ammunition, so that they are exhausted by fatigue; but in the war to achieve this goal, we should also have a certain limit, that is, our own military force cannot be contained here too much, and our manpower and material resources cannot be consumed too much here, so as not to affect the situation of the main resistance in North China. Therefore, when our army retreated from Baoshan, Wusong, and the city center to the first line of defense, foreign military experts considered it a necessary strategic retreat. Now, from September 11 to October 26, our army's resistance on the first line has lasted for a month and a half: most of our fortifications have been destroyed, and the enemy's consumption of military force has also been very huge, so it is completely necessary to retreat to the second line of defense at present in terms of strategy.</p>
<p>However, one point must be pointed out now: the movement of the line of defense is by no means abandonment, and it does not mean that the war of resistance in this area can be terminated for the defense of Shanghai. Shanghai is the center of our country's finance, industry, and culture. We must not easily let it fall into the enemy's encirclement when we can defend it; at the same time, Shanghai is densely covered with railways and highways, and it is also a necessary place for conducting positional warfare. Once we abandon it, the enemy's mechanized troops will take advantage of the convenience of transportation and quickly seize important locations in our Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas. Therefore, at present, although our line of defense has been partially moved, we should still take defending Shanghai as the main goal on this front. West of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the Suzhou Creek is a natural trench; south of this river, our fortifications have already been completed; in the future, on the one hand, we will resist the enemy's offensive south from Zhenru, and on the other hand, we will launch the flank counterattack of Guangfu and Shixianggong Temple, which can make the second line of defense a solid wall to stop the enemy's aggression.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that our compatriots in Shanghai should have a clear understanding at present. This war of resistance against the invaders is by no means a matter of temporary pleasure, but a difficult task that requires long-term support. Temporary victory is not enough to be happy about, and temporary retreat is not enough to be afraid of. We have already had the experience of the most dangerous war of resistance for seventy-five days, and we should use this important experience to support the long-term war of resistance in the future. Shanghai is an important source of manpower and material resources in our country. We must work together with one heart and never waver, and combine this source of power with the war of resistance, until the final victory of our national liberation. Therefore, when our war of resistance moves from the first line to the second line, we cannot have any emotional wavering, but should prepare for more calm efforts with greater determination.</p>
<h3>British Accept Japanese Apology for Killing British Soldier in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th (Reuters) - The case of the Japanese aircraft machine-gunning and killing British soldier McGowan on Avenue Joffre on October 22 in Shanghai can now be considered closed. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a letter from the British Embassy today, stating that the British government has accepted the official document issued by Foreign Minister Hirota on Sunday afternoon, expressing the Japanese government's apology.</p>
<h3>Sun Tonggang's Escape Story</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th - On October 12th, our brave flying generals, piloting six aircraft, were ordered to set off to bomb the enemy's base in Tanggu, but only five reached their destination. The aircraft piloted by our Squadron Leader Sun Tonggang, because the propeller of the aircraft suddenly fell off in mid-air, could not continue flying, so he had to signal to his companions with his hand and then land. At that time, everyone thought that Squadron Leader Sun had made a heroic sacrifice, so the newspapers published news of the martyrdom of our bravest flying general one after another. We were saddened by this unfortunate news, but unexpectedly Squadron Leader Sun returned safely on the 18th, which is exactly the kind of thing that makes people turn from tears to laughter and is a pleasant surprise. Although Squadron Leader Sun did not return in his original aircraft, he brought back a brave little dog and a story that was both heroic and brave.</p>
<p>The truth is that when the propeller of Squadron Leader Sun's aircraft fell off, he and a bomb aimer could have jumped down with parachutes, but he wanted to preserve his aircraft, and even in the most dangerous moment, he was unwilling to sacrifice this valuable national tool, so he signaled to his five companions with his hand, indicating that everything was fine, and instructed them to continue flying to their destination and complete their great mission, without worrying about his personal safety, and then he used his wonderful piloting skills to land completely by gliding. Although he lost the propeller this time, it was the smoothest landing he had ever encountered in his life.</p>
<p>When the aircraft was about to land, he and his companion hurriedly took out their pistols from their sides, because they were prepared to fight the enemy to the death if they landed in the enemy's position, until there was only the last bullet left in the gun, and then commit suicide to make a heroic sacrifice. The aircraft landed, and they saw two farmers and several fishermen. The farmers and fishermen looked at the flying general coming down from the sky with surprised eyes. They could not tell whether the people on the aircraft were their brave soldiers or their public enemy - the Japanese, so the two sides began to argue. The farmers initially did not believe that Chinese people would wear such strange clothes, but after Squadron Leader Sun's repeated explanations and telling them his name, sure enough, the three words "Sun Tonggang" had considerable effect. These three words seemed to be deeply imprinted in their minds, knowing that Sun Tonggang was a nationally famous aviator.</p>
<p>At this time, Squadron Leader Sun suddenly saw a team of soldiers wearing yellow uniforms coming from a distance. At first, he felt very surprised, but later he realized that they were soldiers guarding the coast. There were 200 of them, led by a captain. They had been forced to retreat because their position had been occupied by the enemy. Their leader had surrendered to the enemy, but they were unwilling to be slaves of the enemy and be driven by the enemy. They were still followed by a dog, which was said to be unwilling to follow its master - their general - to surrender to Japan. They were still wearing summer uniforms, enduring hunger and cold, waiting for an opportunity to kill the enemy again.</p>
<p>This group of loyal and brave soldiers really made Squadron Leader Sun extremely excited. This time, he got another ironclad proof of the loyalty and bravery of our country's soldiers in resisting the war, which is how worthy of joy! He talked to them and learned that they had no plans, only knowing that they were unwilling to surrender to the Japanese. So Squadron Leader Sun readily agreed to temporarily command them, and promised to find them work and provide them with food and clothing after returning to Shandong. At this time, more and more people gathered in the village, all happily welcoming Squadron Leader Sun and this group of iron-blooded men. "Friends, please take good care of this aircraft for me," Squadron Leader Sun exhorted this group of villagers with a kindly attitude. "If the enemy comes, burn it quickly. If the enemy doesn't come, wait for me to have the opportunity to send someone or come in person to take it back," Squadron Leader Sun added a sentence before leaving. He looked reluctant to part with the aircraft, because that aircraft was still as good as new except for the propeller, but he finally reluctantly led this group of brothers away from that village.</p>
<p>At this time, the sky was already covered with dark clouds, and heavy rain poured down. Squadron Leader Sun and his group had extreme difficulty moving on the muddy road. At night, the searchlights on forty enemy warships shone indiscriminately on the shore. They did not even dare to smoke cigarettes. During the day, they had to avoid the enemy's plainclothes teams. But they mustered their courage, braved the danger, disregarded hunger and cold, and full of hope, groped forward in the dark of night. Fortunately, there was that loyal and brave little dog leading the way. They walked for twenty-four hours and finally returned safely to the border of Shandong Province.</p>
<p>After arriving at their destination, Squadron Leader Sun immediately went to see the authorities and reported everything that had happened. The authorities praised him greatly, and gave the group of brothers winter uniforms, woolen socks, and cotton shoes, and incorporated them into the front-line troops. They were extremely grateful at the time. They were not grateful for getting warm clothes and enough to eat, but for regaining the opportunity to kill the enemy.</p>
<p>Only then did Squadron Leader Sun rush to the railway station, but the train he was riding on was bombed by four enemy aircraft again. At that time, two passenger cars were destroyed by the bombing, but fortunately the locomotive was unharmed and continued to drive forward.</p>
<p>"After arriving at a certain airfield, enemy aircraft came to drop bombs again, as if welcoming Squadron Leader Sun. To be honest, we have long put life and death out of our minds," Squadron Leader Sun replied excitedly to the reporter's question. "I haven't taken a bath or rested for several days, please forgive me for not being able to talk more," he said, and then shook hands with the reporter happily and said goodbye. The reporter watched the brave flying general walk away slowly with the little dog, and felt infinite relief for his escape.</p>

<h3>Tenth Aspect of Wartime Japan</h3>
<p>㊉ Wartime Japanese Theater and Film</p>
<p>In Japan, where thought and speech are under extreme oppression from the military clique, drama and film, as parts of culture, are inevitably subjected to the iron hammer of the military authorities. Let us first discuss theater.</p>
<p>Japanese theater can be broadly divided into commercial theater troupes and artistic theater troupes. Commercial theater troupes include Kabuki, a purely classical drama, and Shinpa-geki, similar to Chinese "civilized drama." Stimulated by the current situation, commercial theater troupes are competing to perform so-called "military works," which the Japanese call "Sai-mono" (affairs of the moment), which can be loosely translated into Chinese as "speculation." These are hastily produced plays that bring news reports of the Sino-Japanese War to the stage, exaggerating how loyal and brave Japanese men are, how enthusiastically the home front (called "after the gun" in Japanese) is making contributions, or how tragedies occur in families due to the conscription of young men. They also put Chinese people on stage as clowns, performing all kinds of ugly behaviors or being insulted by Japanese people, to please the minds of low-class audiences. This kind of low-level military work has flooded various commercial theaters, and has flooded into remote mountain areas far from the metropolis. The Japanese themselves are frowning upon this. Hideo Nagata criticized in the September issue of the theater magazine "La Théâtre": "Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the people have been extremely excited, and theaters and cinemas have frequently staged and screened war-related works. However, no matter which one you watch, it has almost become a stereotype. There has been no progress since the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. As for the vulgar mass drama of commercialism, it is naturally impossible to expect works with a high level of thought. It is unnecessary to say such untimely things now, but at least I hope to stage works that are commensurate with the current cultural level of the Japanese people... During this period, theaters and cinemas perform such anachronistic dramas and films. It is really a national shame." There were also readers' letters in the Asahi Shimbun saying that some military dramas were chilling. For example, what was performed by a certain theater troupe traveling around was inconsistent from the beginning of the story, and the performance was absurd and unrealistic.</p>
<p>As for artistic theater troupes, they have been very active in recent years. In addition to the Shintsukiji and Shinkyō theater troupes, which are based in the Tsukiji Little Theater, the Zenza Theater of Zenza Ichikawa, which has been preparing since last year, will hold its first performance in October. The Bungakuza, with Kyosuke Tomoda as its technical center, and with the participation of Kunio Kishida, Toyoo Iwata, and Mantaro Kubo, will also use the auditorium of the Bunka Gakuin as its base and perform once every other month.</p>
<p>However, the military authorities are determined not to sit idly by and watch the activities of these relatively progressive elements. As a result, Shintsukiji first ran into trouble. Shintsukiji was originally scheduled to perform Gogol's "The Inspector General" (that is, "The Government Inspector" that the Shanghai amateur actors had performed) at the Hibiya Public Hall on September 25. Due to the current situation, the review was not passed, and the Osaka performance in September was also temporarily canceled.</p>
<p>The Shinkigeki troupe had no choice but to disband due to the ripples thrown by the current situation, and Kyosuke Tomoda, the technical center of the Bungakuza, was conscripted by the military clique to the Shanghai front and died in battle. The impact of the military clique on the artistic theater troupes can be imagined. The organizers of the artistic theater troupes still seem to be struggling to survive under the suffocating Japanese situation. The Shinkyō theater troupe performed Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina," adapted by the Soviet N.D. Gorkov, at the Tsukiji Little Theater starting on September 20. Shintsukiji, on the other hand, entered the large commercial theater, performing "Letters of Laughter" at the Shinjuku Daiichi Theater. This play used sound film and was very similar to the Shinpa-geki's serial drama, but because the organizers were progressive elements, critics regarded it as a meaningful attempt.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about Japanese films. Japanese films have also been washed away by the huge torrent of the Sino-Japanese War. Military films, patriotic films, and original films make the audience feel like they are at a meeting. The most noteworthy phenomenon is the proliferation of newsreels. Due to the expansion of the Sino-Japanese War, the audience is eager to understand the current situation on the battlefield, so they love to watch newsreels. The military authorities also took advantage of this point, with the government-designated news agency Domei News Agency supplying war newsreels to various cinemas. The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, Osaka Asahi Shimbun, and Yomuri Shimbun each sent special correspondents to the North China and Shanghai fronts to shoot newsreels and distribute them to various cinemas for propaganda purposes. As a result, before the audience can watch the films they want to watch, they have to watch more than 30 minutes of newsreels, whether they want to or not. Japanese newsreels are really dry and tasteless. Apart from taking a few pictures of artillery fire or marching behind the Japanese army, there is no material from the Chinese side at all. Moreover, under the extremely strict review of the military authorities, any place that is unfavorable to Japan cannot be shown on the screen at all. Even photos of wounded soldiers and shelled houses are also detained. How can this kind of simple thing depict the atmosphere of war?</p>
<p>In addition to newsreels, there are still crudely made military films and shallow love films. There are almost no films with a sense of the times and social significance like the Chinese "Song of the Fishermen," "The Lost Lamb," and "Hearts United in Life and Death." Due to the current situation, soft love films are not very popular either. As a result, the Japanese people can only watch films with militaristic, counter-constructivist colors and superficial corruption. For today's Japanese people, especially those with some knowledge, culture, and education, these days are not easy to live.</p>
<p>Postscript: There is still a lot of material to write about the various aspects of wartime Japan, such as the wartime Japanese economy, the wartime Japanese publishing industry, and the wartime Japanese press. Due to space limitations, there will only be other opportunities to write about them. (Postscript by the author of this article, Lulan) (End)</p>
<h3>Ten-Person National Salvation Corps Donates Funds to Save the Country</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ten-Person National Salvation Corps Federation was founded during the May Fourth Movement in the eighth year of the Republic of China and was one of the earliest anti-Japanese organizations in Shanghai. In recent years, due to environmental factors, it has rarely engaged in national salvation work, but it has continued to work hard in the field of education, such as establishing free schools and promoting literacy education. Recently, since our country's war of resistance against Japan, the government and the people have been of one mind in resisting foreign aggression. The comrades of the association, as the name suggests, should express themselves. Therefore, the responsible personnel decided to donate all of the 7,000 yuan in funds stored in the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China to the government to replenish military needs and resolutely fight. It is planned to donate in installments. The first and second installments have been remitted to the Military Affairs Commission and have been received by the association. It is now heard that the association yesterday remitted the third and fourth installments of 2,000 yuan through the Bank of Communications.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibit Rice Sellers from Raising Market Prices</h3>
<p>Once Discovered, Severe Punishment Will Be Imposed</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Municipal Food Regulation Committee has been extremely concerned about the food regulation of the citizens of Shanghai. It has dredged up sources and set prices, and has completed the task of controlling food during wartime. In order to strictly prohibit rice sellers from taking the opportunity to raise market prices and affecting people's food, the committee issued General Notice No. 10, which stated: "The city's rice and grain have been transported through the efforts of this committee, and the source is increasing day by day. The market price has been reduced successively, and it has been announced to the public in newspapers. It is now found that the city's rice and grain is sufficient, and there is no shortage of food for the people. The highest grade of white japonica rice is still 13 yuan and 6 jiao per shi, and the price of middle and inferior grades is reduced accordingly. If any rice sellers in the city fail to comply with the market price stipulated by this committee, once discovered or reported, they will be submitted to the competent authorities for severe punishment and will never be tolerated. Therefore, it is urgently notified to the public."</p>

<h3>Ten Days of Bloody Battle at Chenjiahang (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>The reporter returned to Shanghai from a certain place in the countryside some days ago. Since there was no convenient vehicle to take at that time, I walked eastward for an hour and felt quite tired. I rested briefly in the shed. When I walked into the shed, I met a wounded young military officer who was waiting for a stretcher there. We told each other our origins, and sat together on the edge of a turntable. I shyly handed the military officer a cigarette, and took one myself to smoke. After we calmed down, we started talking. I hoped to get some more accurate information from this chance encounter, and the wounded young military officer was also willing to tell me about their experience on the battlefield. He was from Shandong, and was courteous and polite to people. I respected him very much. Although we only exchanged a few words, we were very fond of each other, and we began to talk confidentially.</p>
<p>"Comrade, which division are you from? Where were you wounded? Can you tell me about the general situation of your unit's fighting these days?"</p>
<p>After I asked this question, he showed a look of victory and sighs mixed together, and told me in a very calm and tragic tone about the eight-day and night bloody battle of their entire commander and loyal soldiers. The record is as follows.</p>
<p>"We participated in the bloody battle with the enemy for seven days and nights in Liuhang, Yongan Bridge, and Xiaozhuzhai in mid-September. Four battalion commanders, Yang, Chen, Geng, and Yang, died loyally. That time, our division fought against the main force of the enemy's entire division. Although the enemy's equipment was stronger than ours, we finally repelled them with a spirit of great fearlessness, and the front line stood firm. The detailed situation has been published in major newspapers. If you mention it, sir, you will definitely remember it."</p>
<p>"Because the superiors took into account the fatigue of the soldiers, we were replaced to rest and replenish on September 20. In a short period of time, we completed the replenishment, and the morale of the officers and soldiers recovered. At that time, many patriotic groups and celebrities from all walks of life in Shanghai gave our division many items that were beneficial to combat. Mrs. Liao Zhongkai and others raised a lot of medicines and masks for us, and various groups and individuals donated many miscellaneous items. This is what our superiors told us. We have received and applied all of the above items, and all the officers and soldiers of our division are very grateful to the various groups and gentlemen who helped us."</p>
<p>"Because of the national crisis, our own responsibilities, the encouragement of our superiors, and the enthusiastic love and assistance of our compatriots from all walks of life, all the officers and soldiers of our division are willing to go to the front line early to replace friendly troops and continue fighting, so that they can also come back to rest and replenish. Because this kind of fierce battle makes it impossible for a unit to fight against the enemy for a long time, everyone must take turns to fight."</p>
<p>"Our division commander, brigade commander, regimental commander, and battalion commander are all young generals with knowledge, experience, and fearlessness. They can't stand their temper in the rear. The division commander often tells us, 'Fight for the survival of the country and the nation, and we will never be discouraged even if one soldier is sacrificed.' This sentence has become the firm belief of our officers and soldiers, so after we have replenished our personal supplies and ammunition, our division commander led our more than 10,000 bloody soldiers to Chenjiahang Duntusi on the left wing of the Wenzaobang River on the eve of National Day to replace the friendly troops and join the battle."</p>
<p>"The day we joined the battle for the second time, it was raining heavily, and the enemy's planes could not come, so it gave us a good opportunity to charge and kill during the day. On the afternoon of October 9, the Duntusi Bridge Pavilion house was in danger. The enemy's artillery broke through two points and concentrated firepower to bombard a corner of our Duntusi Temple. Because the friendly troops had fought hard for more than a month, the strength of the troops was more seriously damaged, and the position was slightly shaken. The enemy took the opportunity to invade more than 3,000 people. At that time, our division commander immediately ordered Regimental Commander Pan Taowan to lead two battalions to counterattack in the rain during the day. Because Regimental Commander Pan and Battalion Commanders Xiao Guangcan and Zhao Fengchuan have always been the bravest, after half an hour of hand-to-hand combat between the enemy and us, two-thirds of the more than 300 enemies who invaded the rear of our position were killed by our bayonets and hand grenades, and less than 100 people escaped back. The enemy's corpses were lying in the cotton field, and it was impossible to check clearly. Their plaster flags and military equipment were sent to us. This gave the enemy a major shock, and the position was completely restored by these two battalions."</p>
<p>"That night—the eve of National Day—our entire division took over the three- or four-mile-long position from Chenjiahang to Qiaotingzhai. We worked hard all night to strengthen our position, holding bombs in our hands and loading bullets into our guns, waiting for the Japanese invaders to attack. Because the enemy suffered a great loss from us, they did not dare to invade that night, only seeing them using ropes to pull their dead devils to the back."</p>
<p>"On the morning of National Day, we heard the frantic calls of all walks of life in Shanghai to sever economic ties with Japan from the radio. At the same time, the enemy's artillery fired at our position again, but we were not polite either. Their shells came, and our shells went, at a ratio of ten to one, and the enemy and our positions became a cloud of black smoke. We saw the soldiers clapping and shouting when our shells hit, but the devils suffered a lot. They were curled up in the cotton field wiping their tears, calling for their mothers, and chanting Amitabha, but none of it worked."</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Cotton Mills and Vegetable Markets, Over 300 Casualties</h3>
<p>Broken Arms and Legs, Too Horrible to Look At</p>
<p>At about 9:30 yesterday morning, twelve enemy planes flew to Baili South Road, Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai, and dropped more than ten bombs. The first to bear the brunt were the spinning workshop of the Shenxin First Factory and the Minsheng Spinning Factory. The furnace rooms and cotton rooms of both factories caught fire and burned, and the internal machinery, cotton, and living materials were destroyed. Only the outer corridors and buildings remained. It is estimated that about 200 male workers were killed or injured in the two factories. Several bombs fell on the triangular vegetable market. There were many residents selling vegetables at the market. After the bombing, more than 100 people, including vegetable buyers and vendors, were killed or injured on the spot, with broken arms and legs, burnt heads and faces, and groaning on the roadside. It was too horrible to look at, and the order was chaotic. The authorities of the Chinese Concession of the French Concession quickly ordered a large number of detectives to rush to maintain order, and notified the Red Cross Rescue Team to risk going to the rescue, burying the dead one by one and carrying the wounded to various hospitals for treatment. Among them, five people were seriously injured, and their names were sent to Renji Hospital by Hua Bu No. 142 as follows: Zhou Jinzu, 38 years old, Zhou Da Mimei, 14 years old, Zhang Zheng, 63 years old, Zhang Yongzhang, 43 years old, and a certain Pan, about 30 years old.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Battle Enters a New Phase</h3>
<p>— Appropriate</p>
<p>Our army in Zhabei and Jiangwan, since August 13th, has consistently displayed unparalleled bravery, preventing the enemy from daring to directly seize our positions. Only the night before last, due to strategic considerations, did they retreat in an orderly manner. Thus, the Shanghai war has entered a new phase.</p>
<p>During the past two and a half months of war, the enemy's casualties were no fewer than our own, and the amount of ammunition consumed was many times greater than ours. The result is that tens of square miles of land have been temporarily occupied by the enemy. This land has been baptized by artillery fire and has become scorched earth. The enemy must continue to pay a great price to set up defenses in order to prevent our army's counterattack.</p>
<p>On the other hand, our army's achievements in the past two and a half months have won unparalleled glory for the nation. International sympathy for our country is clearly very different from before the war. Not only that, but the spirit of national unity and solidarity has been further consolidated due to such great achievements. Now, the compatriots throughout the country already believe that a long-term war of resistance is the only way for our nation to survive.</p>
<p>Such is the significance of the first phase of the Shanghai war. In the future, our army will move to new defense lines to fight, and there will be more favorable military conditions. Of course, the future can be even more optimistic.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Near Zhoujiaqiao in Western Shanghai, Our Army Holds the South Bank of the Suzhou River</h3>
<p>Enemy heavy artillery bombarded the north of Xinjing all night without stopping. Fierce battles were fought in both Zhenru and Jiangqiao. Our isolated army in Zhabei still defends the Sihang Warehouse.</p>
<p>Since our army retreated to the new defense line, morale has remained high and defenses have become more consolidated. This morning, our reporter inspected along the north of the Suzhou River to Caojiadu, then to the end of Avenue du President Doumer, the Fahuazhen Station, the end of Haig Road, and Xujiahui. The remnants of the battle in Zhabei have not yet subsided. The loyal and brave soldiers of our isolated army who are defending the Sihang Savings Society Warehouse are still fighting desperately against the enemy's attacks, which have been repeatedly launched, with great sacrifices. Starting this morning, the enemy changed to an encirclement strategy and dared not advance lightly. Traffic on the New Rubbish Bridge has been cut off. The area near the north of the bridge is closed to pedestrians and guarded by the Municipal Council detectives. However, the general situation is relatively quiet. On the western part of Shanghai, along Zhongshan Road, the enemy has occupied Datong University. We destroyed the Zhongshan Road Bridge to stop the enemy's advance and built solid fortifications along the south bank of the Suzhou River, relying on the dangerous terrain to hold the line. This morning, enemy planes circled and bombed the Xinjing area in northwestern Shanghai in batches, causing many casualties among refugees. Several Municipal Council ambulances were parked at the end of Avenue du President Doumer, going back and forth for rescue. From last night until this morning, the enemy's heavy artillery was concentrated on bombarding the north of Xinjing, without stopping all night. There was also intense artillery fire in the Nanxiang area, where the enemy and us are still in a stalemate near Xiaonanxiang. The war situation north of Guangfu is quiet. As for the Zhenru town, the enemy launched a fierce attack from three directions. Our army calmly resisted. Although outnumbered, they have been surrounded. But our loyal and brave soldiers would rather die than surrender. The fierce battle is still continuing this morning. At the same time, to the west of Zhenru town, south of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line, Jiangqiao town north of the Suzhou River, also saw a fierce battle. The enemy attempted to break through a bloody path and continue to attack south, but was closely blocked by our army. In addition to breaking through our Nanxiang railway line, the enemy also appears to be dividing its forces to sneak across the Suzhou River from the Zhenbei Highway, spying on our Xinjing in the north and threatening our Nanshi (South City). We have heavy troops defending this line, and the Zhenbei Bridge has also been destroyed to prevent the enemy's advance. We will definitely give the invading enemy a head-on blow.</p>
<h3>Eyewitness Account of the Isolated Army in Zhabei Resisting the Enemy</h3>
<p>Three attacks were repelled. An American soldier laughed as he was beckoned by our troops. The people admired them as auspicious stars and clouds.</p>
<p>The eight hundred or so men of the 88th Division Xie Jinyuan Regiment, who are preparing to make a heroic sacrifice and defend the Sihang Warehouse north of the Suzhou River, refusing to withdraw from Zhabei, are still holding their original position today. The warehouse is only separated from the Suzhou River by a river. It can be seen from the intersection of Xinzha Road and Changsha Road. Today, since dawn, our residents in the concession, admiring the bravery and heroism of the army, gathered there, craning their necks to watch, as if they were admiring auspicious stars and clouds. According to a shop owner, his shop happened to be on the south bank of the Suzhou River. Looking at the north bank from the window of the upper floor, even the beards and eyebrows could be clearly distinguished. According to him, yesterday the enemy army tried to break into the Sihang Warehouse three times but failed, and he witnessed the deaths and injuries of more than a dozen enemy soldiers. He was very excited. According to him, each time the enemy charged in, there were more than a dozen people. Before they reached the steps, four or five of them were hit by our army's machine gun bullets. The rest of the enemy hurriedly dragged the corpses away. The last time, because our army threw hand grenades from the roof, there were more deaths and injuries, totaling no less than a dozen people. Moreover, our army was quite humorous while bravely killing the enemy. When the enemy fled for the last time, our army reached out from the window to beckon. Seeing this, the enemy fled even faster. The American soldiers stationed on the south bank could not help but laugh.</p>
<h3>Our Army Is Still Defending Zhenru Town</h3>
<p>The town has been surrounded by enemy troops. Enemy planes bombed the whole town indiscriminately, inevitably turning it into scorched earth.</p>
<p>After our army in Jiangwan and Zhabei moved southwest for strategic reasons, the area south of the Zhenru Railway Station and north of the Suzhou River became the center of the war. After the enemy occupied the Zhenru Railway Station, they attacked our Zhenru town along the Zhenru Big Field Highway. Dozens of enemy planes bombed Zhenru town wildly last night, inevitably turning the whole town into scorched earth. Although the defending army of our army has been surrounded by enemy troops on all sides, they still bravely fought, firmly defended, and refused to retreat. Although the enemy troops have crossed the town and attacked south, the defending army of our army has vowed to coexist with the town. As of noon today, our army is still fighting hard. Looking from afar, the whole town has flames soaring into the sky and is burning fiercely.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency, who was with the army, reported at 12:45 pm on the 28th that north of Jinan New Village, a part of our army is still fighting a desperate battle with the enemy. Since 9:30 pm last night, they have been advancing towards Changbang and have formed a solid line with Zhujiang Alley, Hengjing Alley, East Hengjing Alley, Meng Alley, Houjia Alley, and Pengpu Town, confronting the enemy. The battle is extremely fierce. Our army is fighting bravely, with each soldier acting as a hundred men. As of 5:00 am this morning, the enemy's casualties were over 700.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the North Bank of Xinjing</h3>
<p>The enemy's artillery fire was concentrated and then stopped.</p>
<p>The enemy troops crossed Zhenru town and continued to attack the position of our army on the north bank of Xinjing along the Zhenbei Highway. This morning, there was a fierce war on the north bank of Zhoujiaqiao Xinjing. Our army relies on the south of the Suzhou River to defend it, which is extremely solid. The enemy troops decided it was difficult to attack. Since last night, the enemy's artillery fire has been concentrated on bombarding the area around Xinjing and Zhoujiaqiao on the north of our army. It has not stopped this morning. Our army's position has not been damaged. Enemy planes are unusually active in the sky above the area.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Fierce Attack on Jiangqiao Has Been Repelled</h3>
<p>The northeast of the town is in fierce battle.</p>
<p>In Jiangqiao town, which is about two kilometers south of the middle section of the Zhenru Nanxiang railway line northwest of Xinjing, our army has deployed extremely strong fortifications. Since last night, the enemy army has launched a fierce attack on our army's position in the town. The artillery fire was concentrated on the town, and enemy planes also bombed it extensively. Under the cover of artillery fire, the enemy troops charged several times, but our army immediately gave them a head-on blow, and all were repelled by our army. This morning, the northeast of the town is still in fierce battle.</p>
<h3>Enemy Artillery Bombards the Entire Line of Guangfu</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter with the army in Guangfu reported at 10:00 am on the 28th that the war situation on the entire line north of Guangfu has been quiet since last night until this morning. However, enemy artillery and planes are still carrying out their destructive violence, bombing our entire line of positions, and the planes are especially disturbing. Our army is calmly dealing with it and is closely vigilant, he said.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Attempts to Cross the River at Zhoujiaqiao</h3>
<p>Our army used machine guns to strafe the enemy, and the enemy did not succeed.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that our army moved southwest from Zhabei Jiangwan and was ready to be deployed according to the planned program early yesterday, and then moved south in an orderly manner after vigilance. The point of Kun advancing into the concession business district has abandoned Datong University and safely withdrew from the south bank of the Suzhou River. After the enemy marines occupied the area, they moved to the edge of the river on both sides of the bridge at the family bridge yesterday. The army calmly responded under the artillery fire and fired with machine guns, and finally failed.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Occupy Datong University</h3>
<p>Our army firmly defends the south bank of Zhongshan Road Bridge</p>
<p>The enemy troops occupying Zhabei advanced south along Zhongshan Road last night and attacked our army. A battle took place between the two armies west of the Central Mint and north of Datong University. The enemy army came fiercely. Our army bravely resisted and fought hard for several hours. Finally, because there was no danger to defend, they moved to the south bank of the Suzhou River. When the Zhongshan Road Bridge was blown up, solid fortifications were arranged on the south side of the Zhongshan Road Bridge. Datong University north of the bridge was occupied by enemy troops last night.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Pudong Was Relatively Quiet Yesterday</h3>
<p>There was artillery fire between the two sides until 10:00 last night.</p>
<p>After our army in the Zhabei Jiangwan area moved to the new defense line, the Pudong area was as calm as usual because of the solid defense. At 8:15 pm last night, the powerful artillery team in the rear launched a joint attack on the enemy's position again, triggering a fierce artillery battle. The enemy ships fired more densely at first, but after 8:45 pm, they gradually became sparse, and after 10:00 pm, the entire line became quiet. There was no movement until dawn. The reporter inspected various places this morning. The streets and markets were still unusually lively, and the shops were half-open, no different from the previous few days. There were many pedestrians on Pudong Avenue, with calm expressions, as if they did not know there was a war. After crossing the avenue and entering the countryside, although the villagers have been frightened by the enemy planes, they have recently learned how to avoid them and have become calm. The innocent children, in groups of three or five, were skipping rope in the warm sunshine, with no fear at all. The reporter ran into several friends on the way. These people knew that the new strategy in Zhabei was a necessary path in the process of resistance, and there was nothing to be surprised about. They also said that they were not prepared to move elsewhere, because our army and police regiment were able to do their duty, and there was no concern about the security in the war zone. Being in it, they were still satisfied both spiritually and materially, they said.</p>
<p>In Pudong, this morning, there were still two or three enemy planes circling around, constantly scouting, again and again, sometimes high into the clouds, sometimes flying very low. The mission they were carrying seemed to be scouting our positions and artillery positions, he said.</p>
<h3>No Change in the Northern Position of Nanxiang</h3>
<p>The enemy bombarded the Nanxiang area yesterday. Our army's position was not damaged.</p>
<p>North of the railway line, our army is still firmly defending its original position. Except for the line of Shi Xiang Gong Temple, which was withdrawn to Dengqiao Town, there is no change in Xiaonanxiang Guangfu and other places. Since last night, the enemy army has concentrated its artillery fire on the area around Xiaonanxiang and Nanxiang, where our army is stationed. It has not stopped this morning. Our army's fortifications have not been damaged at all.</p>
<h3>Jiading Is Being Bombed Everywhere</h3>
<p>Farmers in the countryside have been killed. The local order is still very well.</p>
<p>According to a guest from Jiading this morning, the county seat and various towns such as Nanxiang, Waigang, Fangtai, Huangdu, Jiyu, Xuhang, and Malu have been bombed by the enemy, destroying thousands of houses and killing thousands of people. This has been reported in the press many times. Recently, due to the fierce war in the front, enemy planes are increasingly rampant in the rear. In addition to the continuous bombing of the aforementioned cities and towns, as well as trains, cars, and ships related to transportation and the front line, enemy planes are also flying low and circling in the sky over various villages all day long. When they see places where people gather, they drop bombs. At Zhonggou in the west of Fangtai Town, eleven people were bombed to death the other day. At Shiziwei, one mile north of the town, more than 20 bombs were dropped on the 25th, killing more than 20 people. Other farmers who were harvesting rice and planting wheat in the fields were shot and wounded by machine guns, which could be heard everywhere. At night, they still fly around with illuminating bombs, but the local order is still very well. All sectors are working tirelessly in their respective positions to meet the purpose of long-term resistance.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Continue to Transport Wounded Soldiers Back to Japan</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 27th), the enemy transport ship Murndo, which was carrying small motorboats to Shanghai, and the transport ship Nachisan Maru, which was converted from a merchant ship, docked at the Qujiang Wharf. After unloading the motorboats, they drove inland to the Huishan Wharf. More than 2,000 wounded enemy soldiers were transported back to Japan.</p>
<h3>Our Army on the Pinghan Line Reaches Xingtai</h3>
<p>The Enemy in the Zhang River Is Surrounded</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Our army on the Pinghan Line has made continuous progress, reaching Xingtai on the 27th. The enemy in the Zhang River retreated to the north of Baoding, with a force of about two divisions in the middle, and has been surrounded by us. The enemy in eastern Jin is also collapsing towards Pinghan (Special Telegram on the 27th).</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships on the Yangtze River Are in Action</h3>
<p>(Changshu Correspondence) It is now the turn of autumn and winter, and the tide of the Yangtze River is in its usual small flood, so recently, the enemy often travels back and forth between the ports along the Yangtze River here, but the water level is low and shallow, and there is nowhere to apply its skills, so the Yangtze River is as calm as usual. However, there are often enemy ships anchored in the heart of the river, about six or seven miles outside the port of Hupu, seemingly preparing to wait for an opportunity to move. However, our river defense is solid, and it is difficult for the enemy to succeed. On the 22nd, three ships were berthed outside the port, and they left that night. The next morning, there was a heavy fog. Suddenly, two enemy ships approached the riverbank and fired five or six shots. Judging from the situation, it seemed that they were spying on our military situation. After we fired back, they retreated. On the morning of the 25th, another yellow ship was replaced and berthed in the same place, but there was no movement. Now, the residents along the river have become accustomed to this and are not afraid, he said.</p>
<h3>We Should Make Every Effort to Mediate Based on the Explicit Provisions of the Covenant</h3>
<p>Wang Jie'an Cables Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Wang Jie'an, a member of the National Economic Construction Commission, cabled Chairman Chiang in Nanjing yesterday, stating that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is about to be held. We should, based on the explicit provisions of Articles 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Treaty, that "the Chinese Government undertakes to refrain from seeking special rights from foreign governments or nationals, or from establishing spheres of influence or acquiring superior rights in any designated area in China," instruct the three representatives, Gu, Guo, and Qian, to make every effort to mediate. In particular, we should sternly refute the Japanese side's distortion of the facts and deception of the international community, so as to value national integrity and safeguard sovereignty, he said.</p>
<h3>Belgium Invites Germany and Russia to Participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>Japan's refusal to participate was expected. The conference work can be carried out quickly.</p>
<p>⊙ Brussels The Belgian government has decided to send invitations today to Germany and the Soviet Union, inviting them to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to be held here on November 3. It is reported that this move is based on the consent of other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. It is widely believed that the postponement of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will not delay the progress of the conference, because according to the original plan, the first meeting to be held on October 30 was only a formality, to decide to send invitations to Germany and the Soviet Union. After that, there will be a three-day recess to await replies from Russia and Germany. It is widely expected that when the conference officially opens on November 3, representatives of Germany and the Soviet Union will be able to attend. Japan's refusal to participate was expected, so it did not cause real disappointment. According to general opinion, if Italy, Germany and Portugal do not defend Japan and hinder the progress of the conference, then Japan's absence will enable the conference to carry out its work more quickly. As for the League of Nations Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue, which was originally scheduled to meet on November 5, it has now been indefinitely postponed and will be convened again after the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is over. (Central News Agency Reuters Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Washington] It is widely believed that President Roosevelt's announcement that the purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is to mediate the Sino-Japanese conflict, is now, because of Japan's refusal to participate in the conference, even if it is not impossible, it is in an extremely difficult position to achieve. The American isolationists originally did not approve of participating in foreign affairs, but after hearing President Roosevelt's statement that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was convened for the purpose of reconciliation, they no longer insisted on dissent. Now that the situation has changed, the United States may be drawn into the whirlpool and there is a risk of adopting a threatening plan. Seeing this situation, the isolationists may repeat the high-profile statement of rejecting foreign affairs. This is also what the US President is worried about. In fact, what steps are there other than reconciliation? This has not been considered, or it is expected that a kind of peaceful condemnation will be proposed in the future, such as recalling ambassadors. However, judging from the phenomenon, it is assumed that the government has not used such a policy of prior consideration to tie the hands of the US delegation (Central News Agency Reuters Telegram on the 28th).</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debates the Case of Japanese Planes Killing British Soldiers</h3>
<p>The British MP welcome retaliation. Pay attention to Japan fulfilling its promises.</p>
<p>[London] Conservative Party member Wardel first inquired in the House of Commons today about the case of British soldier McGovern being killed by a Japanese plane in Shanghai. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that at 3:30 pm on October 24, several British and American expatriates were walking outside the Public Concession, but the place was within the boundary defended by British soldiers. Suddenly, a Japanese plane opened fire on them with machine guns. They rushed to avoid the British soldier defense post within the defense line. Unexpectedly, the Japanese plane flew around for a week and then directly attacked the British soldier defense post with machine guns, three times. British soldier McGovern was injured and died shortly after. Three horses were also lost. Fortunately, the foreigners were unharmed. After that, the Japanese plane continued to strafe three other British soldier defense posts along the defense line, but there were no deaths or injuries. After the first attack, the British soldier defense post returned fire at the Japanese plane (the House of Commons cheered loudly upon hearing this). The British Commander-in-Chief immediately notified the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army stationed in Shanghai of this inexcusable attack. The Japanese government subsequently took three steps: ㊀ Apologized to the British Ambassador to Japan, ㊁ Undertook to impose appropriate sanctions on those responsible after the investigation is completed, ㊂ Agreed to compensate for the losses of the victims. British Ambassador to Japan Craig has accepted the Japanese government's apology and declared to it that the British government believes that the British soldiers' retaliation was completely reasonable. In the future, if the same incident occurs, it will still be dealt with in this way (the crowd cheered), he said. Wardel also asked whether the compensation given to the family members of McGovern by the Japanese government was as appropriate as the British authorities considered. Eden replied that he thought so. Labor Party member Thorne inquired about the caliber of the guns used by the British soldiers. Eden replied that the British soldiers used light machine guns to return fire. Conservative Party member Ginstone asked the Foreign Secretary whether it was possible to investigate whether the Japanese government had punished those responsible. The Foreign Secretary replied that the steps taken by the Japanese government to fulfill its promise to appropriately punish those responsible have not yet been reported. He thought that Congress did not want him to continue to make statements about this matter at this time. In short, the British government certainly wanted to know and study the steps taken by the Japanese government, he said (Central News Agency Reuters Telegram on the 27th).</p>
<p>[London] The British Cabinet met yesterday for three and a half hours, chaired by Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon. According to well-informed sources, most of the time was spent discussing the situation in the Far East (Haitong Telegram on the 27th).</p>
<h3>The Chamber of Commerce Issues Certificates Free of Charge</h3>
<p>More than 1,600 copies have been issued.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issues certificates for commercial goods in accordance with the provisions of Article 3, Paragraph 5 of the Chamber of Commerce Law to facilitate transportation. Since it was submitted to and approved by the Commander, all industries have felt it very convenient. Now, several hundred certificates are issued every day. From the start of the Shanghai war to the 27th of this month, 1,693 certificates have been issued. This certificate can be issued as long as the chairman of the relevant trade association guarantees that there are no smuggled goods or contraband goods. No fees are charged for member stores of the trade association. The procedures are extremely fast and there is no delay.</p>
<h3>Ships in the Suzhou River Are Moving West</h3>
<p>Since our army announced the blockade of the north bank of the Suzhou River and the concession authorities warned the south bank, the number of ships in the river has decreased. Yesterday morning, we abandoned Dachang Zhabei, and the Suzhou River was inevitably controlled by the enemy army. Yesterday morning, all ships moved west, retreating to the whole Fanwangdu. Except for some tugboats and sampans owned by foreign merchants, those of our people's ships that could not sail out have all changed to berth on the south bank.</p>
<h3>Trivial Commentary</h3>
<p>— Appearance</p>
<p>Japan has formally submitted a reply rejecting participation in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. I had long expected that they would not participate. If they did participate and were severely condemned by representatives from many countries, even if you had the skill of Zhuge Liang debating the Confucian scholars, you would only turn red and leave. Therefore, the enemy authorities expressed their views in the form of a declaration. The wonderful sentence was "Japan promotes China's goodwill with a tolerant attitude. Unexpectedly, China lacks the ability to appreciate and has made provocative acts against Japan, causing Japan to have to defend itself and fight." After the people of the world listened to this, wouldn't they laugh their teeth off? Japan's acts of aggression since the September 18th Incident have been approaching step by step. The various crimes are countless. It also says that it promotes China's goodwill. We really dare not accept this kind of goodwill. Non-special countries with the best patience like me cannot appreciate it. I am afraid that no country can appreciate it. The enemy closed their eyes and can publish such words to the world. They are really shameless.</p>

<h3>The Front and the Rear (1)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shudi</p>
<p>㊀ Mr. Chen Duxiu in a Humble Alley</p>
<p>More than a month ago, Mr. Chen Duxiu, who was granted amnesty and released from prison with the eight characters "Deeply Patriotic, Profoundly Aware of Humiliation," soon arrived in Wuhan.</p>
<p>Although he was once the leader of the second-largest political party in China; although he represented the Communist Party ten years ago and issued a joint declaration with the Kuomintang leader; however, compared to practical political activities, his theoretical and academic stance is more likely to evoke deep memories and fervent attention from people across the country. From a political life perspective, it could be said that it was interrupted long before he went to prison, even within the political party to which he belonged. However, viewed as a theorist and thinker, even today, in the face of major events like China's War of Resistance against Japan, there is a need to listen to his arguments. Thinking this, the reporter, along with two gentlemen from this newspaper, boarded a ferry to Wuchang at a wharf in Hankou, heading on the road to visit him.</p>
<p>According to the agreed time from the previous day, we arrived in front of his residence. This place can be described as a kind of humble alley. The narrow alley was filled with a pungent, fishy odor, and the houses on both sides even had doors leaning precariously, exposing some tattered furniture inside to passersby. Number 26 was a relatively tidy Shikumen (stone-framed gate) which was also open. Entering the gate, there was a courtyard planted with some flowers and plants. A gravel path stretched out under our feet. Several doors were lined up along the side, and there wasn't a single person in the courtyard, which made the reporter hesitate. I had to shout loudly:</p>
<p>"Is anyone there? Is anyone there?"</p>
<p>It was unknown which door it was from, seemingly through several walls, a low, hoarse woman's voice came: "Who are you looking for? Who are you looking for?" — From the word "麼," it was known to be a local accent.</p>
<p>"Does Mr. Chen live here?"</p>
<p>"Someone named Chen? The one named Chen lives in the westernmost door."</p>
<p>Walking a few steps west along the gravel path, we immediately discovered that on the westernmost end of the road, there was a sign pasted on a door, with the words "Chen Residence," exactly what we were looking for.</p>
<p>The double doors were covered with green paint, without Spring Festival couplets. Instead, four rows of crimson-colored phrases resembling maxims were inlaid: "Speak good words," "Be a good person," "Do good deeds," "Read good books." Judging from the paint, these phrases seemed to have been there for a long time. However, it is meaningful that someone with an experience like Mr. Chen is now living in this house.</p>
<p>While knocking on the door, I held the business card with the address personally written by Mr. Chen in my hand, prepared to deal with the doorman or someone who might open the door. According to the reporter's experience, for the doorman of a celebrity, pulling out a business card with something written by his master can at least avoid him saying, "I'll go take a look for you," or even flatly saying, "He's not home."</p>
<p>The door opened quickly. To my surprise, it was Mr. Chen himself who opened the door. He was wearing a gray cloth long gown, standing hunched over by the door, constantly smiling and saying, "Please come in, please come in." His scholarly, half-bald head only had some gray hair on the back of his head; high eyebrows covering bright eyes, a slightly upturned short mustache, and most noticeably, his broad forehead, which revealed wisdom. — All of this presented the visitor with the unmistakable presence of an extraordinary person in an instant.</p>
<p>Stepping through the door, there was a small, rectangular courtyard, no more than three or four zhang (about 10-13 meters) long and only one zhang (about 3 meters) wide. It seemed to be covered with a large awning, making everything appear very dark, and with the drizzle, it became even more gloomy. One side of the courtyard was the front door we entered; one side was a wall; one side was a house with fan doors; and the westernmost side was Mr. Chen's reception room where he received us. Upon entering such a cramped, narrow, and damp place, we immediately felt as if we were being suffocated. As we walked towards the reception room, the two gentlemen from this newspaper who came with me reported their names to Mr. Chen. Walk, walk, walk... However, in just a few steps, we found ourselves already inside the reception room.</p>
<p>The reception room was also rectangular, with the door opening on a corner, and one window facing the dark courtyard. Although it was noon, I never clearly saw the face of the gentleman sitting with his back to the window. I can't remember if there were couplets or other decorations on the wall. Several chairs were placed haphazardly. Although a thick carpet was laid on the floor, its moldy condition immediately made one think of a storage room for old objects.</p>
<p>In addition to the three of us from the newspaper, there were three other gentlemen present with Mr. Chen. After taking our seats, I first asked: "Mr. Chen, do you have important matters to attend to?"</p>
<p>"No, just casual conversation."</p>
<p>Thinking about Mr. Chen's current situation, and considering our identities as news reporters, it was natural that Mr. Chen would have various concerns. I tried to restrain myself, thinking it best not to talk about overly specific issues, so as not to make Mr. Chen feel difficult to speak freely.</p>
<p>Because I heard Mr. Chen's speech the previous day, on the topic of "Significance of the War of Resistance," he told more than a thousand listeners: This war of resistance against Japan is by no means a simple venting of hatred towards Japan; rather, it is a war that the Chinese nation inevitably encounters on its path to building a modern nation. If China wants to build a free and equal modern nation, it must first liberate itself from its semi-colonial status, and the first thing it encounters is a decisive battle against imperialism. Therefore, he said, there are only two possible futures: If we win, the entire Chinese nation will be liberated and embark on the broad road to nation-building; if we lose, all 450 million compatriots will, without exception, become slaves of the imperialists.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Wreak Havoc in Beixinjing</h3>
<p>The Suzhou He Bridge in Beixinjing Zhenbei Road Heqiao has been destroyed by bombing in the past few days. The town has been continuously and wildly bombed by enemy planes, causing extensive damage to civilian houses. Residents have fled completely, and commercial activities have ceased. From early morning until late last night, enemy planes took turns flying over and dropping bombs, and continuously opened fire and strafed the town and nearby villages. Details of casualties and damage are still difficult to ascertain. Also, in the airspace from Hongqiao Road to Zhuzhai, Huacao, Zhuangjiajing, Fojusi, the airfield, Hongqiao, Chengjiaqiao, etc., enemy planes flew back and forth in groups, dropping bombs and opening fire all day long. The extent of the damage will be investigated further.</p>
<h3>The Miserable Situation of Refugees in the Northwest Suburbs of Shanghai</h3>
<p>Weeping in Despair with Nowhere to Go</p>
<p>Yesterday, from dawn until late evening, refugees were crowded along the north bank of the Suzhou River from Xiaoshadu to Fanwangdu, hoping to cross the river and reach the south bank. However, ferries were nowhere to be seen, and the garrison troops of the concession guarding the south bank did not allow them to cross. Countless refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, wept and wandered around, at a loss. With the special permission of the Italian military at the Fanwangdu Iron Bridge, no fewer than several thousand refugees from the north bank of the Huai River were able to cross the bridge and leave that bank. Refugees from Beixinjing, Zhoujiaqiao, Xuejiaku, Sanjingmiao, Gongjiazai, Chenjiadu, etc., fled along Bailinan Road towards the concession, the number of people so large that the road was blocked. Because the garrison troops of the concession did not allow refugees to enter the concession, men, women, old, and young stood crying, while others went south, hoping to find another way in. By late evening, tens of thousands of people stood at the crossroads. The people of western Shanghai had nowhere to go, no place to stand, and enemy planes flying overhead, machine guns firing everywhere. Looking up, they wept in despair.</p>

<p>War of Resistance Youth, Issue 24</p>
<h3>The Most Brilliant Victory Under All-Out War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Zhao Weizu</p>
<p>China has begun an all-out war of resistance against Japan to stop the insatiable desires of the violent Japanese. In history, China has been a nation that yearns for peace. Even before the incident broke out, we still hoped for peace. Chairman Chiang said, "...Peace has not reached despair, and we will never give up on peace..." But Japan's atrocities can no longer be discussed in terms of peace." Leaving aside the past, just from the "September 18th" incident to now, it has been a full six years. We surrendered the land of the four northeastern provinces with our hands tied and did not use force to deal with it, but only used diplomatic means to recover the lost territory. This kind of patience can be said to fully demonstrate the painstaking effort to seek peace. But the Japanese warlords cannot understand China's magnanimity and are becoming more and more aggressive. Not only have they occupied Tianjin and Peiping, but they also want to sweep across the entire North China. Everyone: They have already taken the four northeastern provinces, and now they want Peiping and Tianjin, and even North China. Of course, they want Central China, South China, and even the entire land of China. Could it be that I will easily surrender the entire China? Is it possible that an ancient power with five thousand years of culture, accounting for one-twelfth of the world's land, will be ruined in the hands of a small Japan? In fact, it will never happen. There are people of conscience, there is justice, and there is natural law. Therefore, China's prelude to the war of resistance against Japan began with the "August 13th" incident. We believe that as long as we can support the government, obey the leader, engage in all-out war of resistance, and persevere to the end, the final victory will surely be ours. In the past, people generally held the mistaken "fear of Japan" disease, believing that China could not go to war with Japan, and that China's military preparations were far inferior to those of Japan. Before the war in Shanghai, people speculated that Japanese planes would definitely pose a huge threat unrestrainedly in Shanghai's airspace. But as a result, not only did both sides' air forces confront each other, but China's flight technology was far superior to Japan's, completely changing international perceptions. The progress of the air force after six years of hard work is so great, and the other developments can be imagined. We prove, based on observations from all aspects, that under the all-out war of resistance, the final victory will definitely belong to us.</p>
<p>First, in terms of diplomacy, China occupies an absolute advantage. In the newspapers and magazines of various countries, general public opinion is sympathetic to China and condemns the Japanese warlords for their aggression. Furthermore, observing all of Japan's actions, they are detrimental to various countries, because as a result of Japan's aggression against China, the trade of various countries with China will suffer great losses. This time, Japan used warships to blockade Chinese seaports, which has no harm to China, but the commerce of foreigners with China has been greatly affected. Under such circumstances, Japan's diplomacy is bound to be isolated, but the international community values ​​power and profit and does not uphold justice. The United States is the country that we believe is most sympathetic, and this time its ban on arms exports can be said to be completely beneficial to Japan. The other countries can be imagined. Of course, we must rely on ourselves and not on others. We seek to have one less enemy, not to rely on others. This war of resistance has at least gained the sympathy of world public opinion and aroused resentment against Japan's cruel and inhumane behavior. In this regard, we have achieved the greatest victory in terms of national character and national prestige.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of economy, Japan feels even more dangerous. If we assume that their annual military expenditure is 2 million yuan, then Japan may not be able to sustain it for a year. Their country itself does not have sufficient reserves, and their national economic capacity relies entirely on trade with China. If this continues to increase, it will inevitably lead to internal collapse. At that time, they will have to resort to borrowing foreign debt, but they have no collateral, no credit, and no country is willing to lend unsecured funds. Therefore, their economic threat is a fatal wound. (To be continued)</p>
