<h3>敵寇摧殘下之天津</h3>
<p>街上行人遭百般侮辱　各種僞組織紛紛成立　近郊婦女均慘受蹂躪</p>
<p>天津通信、自七月二十九日敵人將天津施行慘酷轟炸、實行軍事佔領之後迄今兩月餘、津市治安秩序、不但未能恢復、而且愈益陷於無政府狀熊中、茲記各情如次、</p>
<p>强佔交通</p>
<p>天津現已成為後方主要軍事根據地、陸上交通工具如北寗路及津浦綫下段、以及自津往各地公路、皆被敵人佔領、作為軍用、目下平津間及平楡間、每日雖對開客車一次、但因沿途兵車擁擠、每次誤點平均在十小時以上、北寗路已無形變成南滿路、所有一切機車·電話·電報·車站房屋·都被南滿路敵人佔用、北寗路在目前名義上雖已恢復辦公、然每次客車開行時間及車輛調動均須聽從南滿路敵人指揮、據傳敵方為便利運輸、已决定將北寗路與偽奉山路接軌、改為偽平奉鐵路、海上交通．事變前即被敵軍强佔、除英商船隻不定期航行外、我國船隻、因日軍强徵、早已南開、空中航行、更是被敵機獨佔、在東局子有很大的飛機傷及格納庫、目下停有敵機三十架、每日分飛津　浦·平漢·等地偵察轟炸、敵人在津有二大營房、即海光寺及東局子、能駐二萬左右軍隊、每日均有敵兵從關外開到、且能儲藏大批軍用品、</p>
<p>搜查行人</p>
<p>最痛心者、即敵軍在街上搜査行人時、百般侮辱、人民為避免危險皆購置敵國旗、以作通行護身符、兩週前、日韓浪人、因製售敵旗、無不大發其不義之財、</p>
<p>利用傀儡</p>
<p>敵估領天津後、亟謀恢復治安、以减輕後顧之憂　乃利用無恥漢奸組織　‘天津地方治安維持會’、職權等於市政府、與總務·公安·財政·工程及衛生·五局、表面係由華人組織、但實際權力皆由敵人指揮偽維持會各局部、均有日本顧問、一切大小事件、須經日顧問允許後、始可辦理、天津漢奸極夥、彼此皆想爭奪官位、因是各種偽組織紛紛成立、如所謂大亞西亞協會．東亞協會·中日親善促進會·東洋協會·華北自治協會·華北青年黨等、</p>
<p>奴化敎育</p>
<p>僞維持會爲獻媚日本、自偽社會局成立後、即組織所謂敎科書修正委員　會、蒐集中小學校敎科書、任意删改國語·史地·社會·公民·等敎科書、如有國恥史料、不平等條約‘九一八、’孫中山、三民主義、黨國旗、帝國主義侵略中國等部份、皆完全删除、認為‘有礙邦交’‘鼓吹革命’‘煽惑靑年’、該委會偽委員人物、即偽社會局長鈕傳善·偽敎育長陶子權·偽專昌林紹昌等、皆為十足漢奸、此外有日顧問多喜等　以前所讀之敎科書、皆被目為‘反動’、該維持會特令各中校於本年起、一律須採用經書及日本語現各校均已遵辦、日文是日人敎授、每校有日敎員一二人不等、敎本內容、荒謬不堪、例如地理課中、將‘滿洲國’偽組織視為一獨立國、在日文課中、極替日本宣傳誇謵</p>
<p>陷害靑年</p>
<p>日軍閥近令偽社會局兼令各校、實施‘思想檢擧’凡敎員·學生·言行思想　、有愛國傾向者、均指爲反日、須加以檢擧、由學校檢擧、或官廳拘捕　因而大部敎員·學生·青年、早已自動離校他居、</p>
<p>荒謬標語</p>
<p>一週前、僞維持會將市立圖書館·通俗圖書館·閱報室·及其他民衆敎育機關、紛紛檢擧將敵人視為所謂有‘有礙邦交’‘有煽動性’之書報雜誌、一律焚燬壁上各種標語·格言·及孫總理遺囑等一律洗刷、另外換上所謂‘實現華化自治’‘促進中日親善造收華北樂土’等荒謬標語、</p>
<p>秩序紊亂</p>
<p>津市地方秩序、除租界外、至今仍未恢復原狀　警察全係徒手、因是日兵·浪人·流氓、極為橫行、良民無法安業、復業却甚少、居民更不堪其擾亂、日兵浪人勒索錢財、強售毒品、更強姦婦女、強架少女、城區近郊村莊靑年婦女、被蹂躏者極多、故近日向租界逃避者甚衆、天津殆成為人間地獄矣、（十五日）</p>
<h3>機械化武器不足懼（續）</h3>
<p>— 特公</p>
<p>—天空威力最顯明的進步，就是高射砲·現在牠能在比較淸朗的天氣中，把飛於一萬二千呎以下的飛機，以十五發擊落，砲上裝有自動的發射機關，能在三十秒鐘內，擊中轟炸機，還裝有聽聲機關，能察覺飛在二十至三十五哩內的敵機，轟炸機最高的速度，以五六分鐘可以飛到·而注意牠的蹤跡，等牠飛進射程之內，就發彈射擊，是很準確的，這是高射砲的兩種大進步。’</p>
<p>—在世界大戰中，很機臨陣，被敵機和被高射砲彈擊落的，為五與一之比，現在西班牙戰爭中·結果却和前相反·那就是高射砲擊落五架，飛機只擊落一架·因此敵軍飛機飛到陣綫後轟炸，比前大覺困難，從前須留在國內防備敵機來襲的飛機隊，現在却能飛出從事反攻了。</p>
<p>主張用機械化戰爭，迅速殲滅敵軍者所注重的武器，其次就是坦克車。他們的希望，却未在西班牙戰爭中實現。坦克車的成續，德國意國或蘇聯的軍事領袖，沒有一個爲之快樂。雙方的輕坦克車，遇到簡單的武器，像斜峭的溝道，行程中的手溜彈，或噴射的發火汽油，就不能保其安全。裝了重鐵甲，雖足防禦抵制坦克車的砲火，但因此就失去行駛靈捷的優點。從這兩點觀來，我們可以下一斷語；那就是坦克車無疑的將密集用以爲輔助步兵進攻的許多機械化武器之一，可是並不能增高攻軍初步中的利益，</p>
<p>還有一層，陸地或天空機械化的隊伍所需的給養，在進攻時都感覺特殊困難。英法軍最近舉行大操，還未完畢，汽油已罄，何况逢到眞的戰爭，接濟的後路，極易被敵軍破壞。照迅速殲滅敵軍的理想而論，這種機械化的攻軍，戰車和軍火接濟的火車上，都只能備一天的燃料，用完了後，自當補充·但是深入敵境的孤軍，怎麼能够得到後方的接濟呢？這却是一個極不易解决的難題，而使侵略者後方管理給養員搔首沒有辦法。</p>
<p>至於瓦斯，似也難收杜希特理想中的美果。由飛機擲落瓦斯炸彈，毀滅大城，那是純粹的簡單的虛話。像紐約般的大城，倘用芥子瓦斯（世界大戰中所用三種瓦期最厲害的一種，逼走居民，要攻擊幾萬次，才能成功。再加芥子瓦斯可以用石灰氳化物消滅牠的效力，倘要眞正收效，定須使牠濃集在地面才行。其實芥子瓦斯，是一種利於守軍的武器，播在地面，阻止攻軍前進。却很有用的。講到新發明未被人知道的瓦斯，化學家都異口同聲，現在還沒有這回事。</p>
<p>侵略者突然進攻，可保立即殲滅敵軍的新武器，現在還未出現·近年來所已改良的武器，却使攻方和守方彼此的地位沒有什麽優劣之分，並且使侵略者有陷於長期戰爭的危險。法西斯的軍隊，在馬德里前所遭的失敗，已大足證明這點·機關槍仍舊是‘戰塲之王，機關槍的確是守軍的利器。</p>
<p>現在世界大勢是傾響和平方面，只有　裁者主政的國家抱侵略主義，獨裁者主政的國家决不敢冒險作長期戰爭，倘她能够避免的語·這一層是民治國很明白的。還有一層，也是民治國所在意的，那就是天空威力發展的影響，已逼令大軍不得不散成小隊藉以自衛。坦克車一類的機械，用少數人駕駛作戰，牠的影響，也是如此。小隊士兵，必須依賴自己，因此新時代戰爭獲勝的機會，是操在國民之手。只有民治國社會的組織經濟的習慣政治的方式能够產生敏捷，而有自制力的士兵，在近代獨裁制下產生這種士兵，却不很容易，因爲民治制度的‘人和’，是獨裁制度望塵莫及的。</p>

<h3>上海戰局</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>近日上海戰事異常劇烈。敵人要在比京會議以前。洗雪些十二日慘敗的恥辱。撑持些‘皇軍’的聲威。不惜極大的犧牲。織續着中央突破的戰略。就目前的戰局看來。敵軍正在依剪刀形的路綫作猛烈的進攻。目標是在我大塲及南翔這兩個軍事中心。可是我軍堅强的抵抗與猛烈的反攻。已經屢挫了敵鋒。而敵軍突出的兩處陣地。還都在我軍三面圍攻之中。當然不容易再有進展。卽使敵軍迫近了進攻的目的地。也非遭遇到我方長時期更堅强的抵抗不可。我全綫怎會因而動搖呢。</p>
<p>在這主力大戰正在開展的時際。我們相信我軍事將領一定運用着深遠精到的謀略。使全軍能以最少的犧牲。獲最大的勝利二十一日我軍在一個晚上。收復了數十村莊更使我們認識我軍戰鬥力的高强。昨日我軍雖有若干村荘。因受敵人砲火猛烈的壓迫。不得不暫時放棄。當然遲早也可以收復過來。無論如何。這第一防綫的戰事。必將持續許多時日。敵人决不能如其願望。在本月以內。佔到什麽‘面子’的。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>抵制日貨運動的現在與將來</h3>
<p>自從全面抗戰運動發生以後，所謂“抵制日貨”和“對日經濟絕交等事，起初好像不把牠們放在“全面抗戰”的範圍內，所以儘管七月份敵人侵佔華北戰事激烈的時候，上海及華南各埠還是有大批的日貨進口：便等到“八一三”的上海戰事發動以後，這一個月的上海日貨進口還是很多。直到上月，各界為着擴大“全面抗戰運動”的範圍，才極力主張對於敵人經濟方面也要絕交，而尤其重要的要“抵制日貨。”這一兩個月抵制日貨的效力究竟怎樣？海關新近發表有些統計數字，很可拿來攷察一下。</p>
<p>據江海關的報吿，九月份上海進口的日貨，在數字上確實比從前少得多了，總計祇值二萬多金單位，合國幣四萬五千餘元，比較戰前，固然是一落千丈，便比較上月份的進口日貨七十萬金單位，也已大火的低落。這在表面上看來，好像是己經收了一點抵制的效果：其實，自八一三戰事發生以後，日本不久又封鎖了中國的海岸，外國船大都不敢到上海來冒險，而日本船則大部徵發為敵人的軍事運輸，自然進口日貨大大的减少了。這不是中國抵制的效果，却是戰時自然的趨勢。所以不獨日貨進口减少，便是其他各國貨物的進⼝也都减少了。</p>
<p>並且，在實際上，九月裏上海戰事，已打得這樣久而又這樣激烈的時候，居然還有正式報關的日貨到四五萬元，這也是不可忽略的一件事，查其中進口日貨各種貨物都有，而比較重要的日本砂糖，有四百九十公担，値三千金單位，人造絲織品値一千餘金單位，五金·機械·車輛等共值二千餘金單位，雜類金屬，值二千六百餘金單位，化學藥品一千八百餘金單位，紙張等類約一千金單位，皮革值一千九百餘金單位，雜貨四千餘金單位。我們看看這一筆賬，類目雖然是不大；但在浴血戰事進行之中，而又在熱烈的抵制日貨運動之下，仍還有這樣一筆仇貨進口，這豈不是我們之恥！並且，這筆數字是經過我國海關正式報關的；還有那些任意出入滬東戰區的日本商船，鬼鬼祟祟的玩那套臨時稅關的把戲，那進口的日貨，究竟有多少，怕就只有敵人自己曉得了。近來報載上海日本重要商店銀行，都在極力勾結漢奸，以謀傾銷他們舊存新進的貨物。戰區中有這樣一個無底漏洞，進口日貨又豈能眞正减少？</p>
<p>所以，我們卽使能夠抵制正式報關進口的日貨至於零，倘使對於敵人强佔區域的進口貨，無法抵制，效力也就有限得很。我們要曉得現在日本貨物，運銷中國的，有四大去處：除中國本部以外，還有東三省，大連租借地以及香港三處。日貨運到東省的數額，現時已和運到我國本部的差不多。在東三省失地未恢復以前，我們對於運到這裏的日貨，就沒有方法抵制。其次日貨運往大連的，通常要此運往我國本部的還耍多，這便是華北大部走私貨物的來源，在華北淪為戰區的情形下，當然也不容易抵制。至於香港，本來也是日貨改頭換面，私運進口的大本營，不過近來數目却還不甚大。便就中國本部來說，平津旣已為敵人佔領，日貨便可由天津正式進口，現時我們也就無法加以干涉，倘仍取走私手段，那也只好聽其自由。所以我們要抵制日貨，在現時這種情形下面，不獨要使政府勢力下面的海關，做到無正式的日貨報關進口。並還要加緊收復失地，根除仇貨能够自由進口的來源。</p>
<p>總之我們不要把抵制日貨的效力，估價得太高，也不要估價得太低，這也是應該配合軍事行動一致進行的。我們倘欲加强武力抗戰的力量，只有努力進行抵制日貨運動；而欲抵制日貨運動的完全成功，也必須在武力抗戰完成以後。我們要認識他們相互關係的重要，再也一步不能放鬆下去了。</p>

<p>日本平日頗以通國皆兵的“徵兵制度”自豪、然而其弊端亦自不少、日本男子滿二十一歲便、須受徵兵檢查、檢查合格、便須入營從軍、一年或兩年滿期之後、各人回到自己原來的職業、受高等教育的人、剛剛畢業、有許多職而不能就、先要去當兵、且須去當自己拿錢出來的志願兵、因爲失却了就職的機會、及至從營中出來、一連失業數年者、所在皆是、於是有許多家境困難者、或實在不願當兵者、在徵兵檢查前數月、即自己戕賊自己的身體、弄得面黄肌瘦、以期檢查落第、然而身體碩大的偉男子、任是如何戕賊、自然得到“甲種合格”、吸烟喝酒放蕩的惡習是染上了、兵役則仍避免不了、這種悲喜劇、也不知有多少、</p>
<p>凡曾入營當過兵的壯丁、一旦國家對外作戰、一紙命令、便須把一切丢下、肩起槍來赴前綫、有的親亡不及葬、有的新婚不及入洞房、有的家貧、全靠他勞作供給一家生活、臨行將女兒或姊妹賣於妓院作娼、有的只有一個老父或老母、因爲没人照料、老父母自殺者亦不少、這些事情是如何慘痛的悲劇、然而傳到新聞紙上、都成了“槍後美談”、因爲被征去打仗的人、都是生産分子、或社會上勞作的有力分子、他們去當兵、社會上的事黹便没有人做、至少感到缺乏、有一個小學校、八個教員、同時被征、試想這個小學校還成什麽樣子、其他工廠·商店職員之被征者更不計其數、於是工廠商店感到人員缺乏、便不得不臨時抱佛脚、拉一些生疏的婦女學生服務於軍需工廠、便是很好的例證、</p>
<p>一個兵士戰死、往往一家的生活失了依柱而徬徨街頭、日本憑空添出許多孤兒寡婦、這都是日軍閥窮兵黷武的賜與、有的寡婦、因失去依靠、無路可走、乃投海自殺、日前各報喧傳殉夫的佐藤主計大慰夫人梅子便是一例、</p>
<p>日本征兵征到各階層、於是便有很發噱的材料成爲巷間的談助、譬如日本戲劇電影界的導演之出發到前綫戰死便是宣傳一時的事件、其最著者爲新劇壇之健將、曾在築地小劇場演過“西綫無戰事”的友田恭助（眞名伴田五郎）便戰死於上海戰綫、其妻田村秋子爲日本有名之女慢、聞夫死訊、含淚發表談話、“我實在不願他死、較之死於戰爭他還有更重的文化使命”、其對於戰爭之咒咀、已意在言外矣、</p>
<p>電影界從軍者甚多、現在上海戰綫者有松竹映畫公司的導演小津安二邸、及P.C.S.的導演山中貞雄、</p>
<p>㊇軍部的人心鼓舞策</p>
<p>因為此次日本師出無名、日本一般國民、均對此事不感興味、他們互相間的問話是、‘日本為什麼要打中國、拿到滿洲還不夠麼’‘若是引起世界公憤、日本做了歐戰時的德國、日本怎樣招架得了、’再加大衆課稅、人民負擔加重、物價騰貴、國民生活感受威脅，強迫兵役、人民敢怒而不敢言、於是大家對此次戰爭、一點也不起勁、’任國民怎樣消極、日本如何能在前綫作戰、於是軍部便動員言論機關、所有報雜誌、都刊戰鼓吹戰爭文字、報道‘日軍大勝的虚偽消息、一方發起國防獻金運動、由上流社會的貴婦人所組成的愛國婦人會、利用心理單純的女學生、到街頭去募捐、各報社也發起軍用機獻納資金傷兵慰問資金等等捐款、從表面一看、日本全國儼然已涂成了一色的軍國色調、然而這纔眞是日本話之所謂‘空元氣呢、軍部為鼓舞人必起見、把近衛拉到街頭演說、如日比谷會堂所舉行之國民精神總動員、近衛卽親自出席演說、議會閉幕後、並以在議會所演說之內容、由無綫電播送於全國、各個大臣且赴各重要都市演說、替日本人打強心劑、</p>
<p>軍部又利用人類的虛榮心、獎勵對‘出征將士’的盛大歡送、譬如有一位藤田某在一個銀行任議員、一旦被徵發、於是該銀行的同事、以前讀書的學校校友、同村同街的隣人、親戚朋友、都要盛大的歡宴這位’出征’的籐田、先是狂飲高歌、然後備許多輛汽車、載貨汽車、親戚朋友同事都坐在車上、每人手裹拿着一張小旗、風駞電掣的在各街游行示威、沿途高唱軍歌狂呼口號、這位藤田身上斜披着一條白布條、用紅字寫、出征籐田某、’他前後左右、都是着黃嗥嘰軍服的在鄉軍人、肩背大籮、上書歡送藤田某君御出征、尚有若干面小旗、上畫‘祈武運長久、’若在東京這游行示威的汽車、一定到皇宮外二重橋參拜皇宮、遙拜天皇、並到明治殿宮或靖國神社參拜、祈武運長久、吃醉酒的歡送者、雖做得興高彩烈而被送的本人、無異被送到葬塲、其家族也如送殯一樣哭喪着臉然而又不能哭出聲來、他不能滴下淚來、這是武士的榮譽啊、</p>
<p>在出發的前幾天、兵營所在地、這種游行的汽車、千知有多少、而滿街上充滿了淒愴的呼喊有許多兵士從鄉下出來、該兵營在附近的小學校、或其他公共塲所、設許多‘面會所、’以便家族和“出征”的兵士會面、老態龍鐘的母親、拉着兒子、　　也有、剛結婚幾天的新嫁娘　　她丈夫泣別的也有、　裏　　孩子、和丈夫依依不舍的　　女人也有、軍閥們為　是　　的征服慾、為發揮他們的征服慾、爲發揮他們的　　狂、不惜驅這計多不願　　的壯丁到前綫送死、日本軍　　成為中國敵人之前、應該是日本國民最大的敵人、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>淞滬戰事。我方處不利之地位者有二。而敵人機械化步隊之優越不與焉一敵人十餘萬大軍。侷處一隅我取包圍之形勢。敵處被包圍之形勢。在兵法有日。圍師必缺。蓋不缺則恐困戰之猶鬥此不利者一也。二以戰略言之。則敵取攻勢。我處守勢。戰綫延長數十里。戒備之處一有疏忽。隨在有發生突破之虞。故兵法有日。十則圍之。蓋非至十倍以上之兵力。不足以言圍此不利者二也。今我軍兵力。旣無十倍之多。而敵人機械化步隊。又如是其兇且猛。而我國忠勇的軍隊。竟能圍困十餘萬敵軍於一隅。竟至兩月有餘之久。使敵人無法突躍而出。宜外人稱許我國用兵之神奇也。</p>
<h3>今晨敵機繼積積轟炸</h3>
<p>今晨本埠有亟需、故楊樹浦方面之敵機七時許始飛出、起初見二架一隊者有四隊、後則三架一架奢陸續飛出、凡三架一隊之敵機、其機有一架作嚮導、形似戰鬥機較小、其色灰白、後面則隨笨重之轟炸機二架、其色灰黑、間有在閘北經過時、作盤旋狀、繞行一週向西北而去從此往返不絕、閘北方面則自九時起至十二時止、每一小時內均有敵重轟炸機三架、在閘北北部中興路北柳營路南一段投彈、第一次所投之彈、落共和新路東至宋公園路之間、該處屬田野、所以敵彈多數未炸、第二第三次之彈、多數落宋公園路東至中興路東首一段、該處房屋較多、故民房被毀約一十餘間、</p>

<h3>赴并道中（二）</h3>
<p>— 時任</p>
<p>石家莊之一日</p>
<p>到了平漢线第一道防綫的石家莊，已是二日晨四時了，天尚未明，正太路不絕的開着小車，我國的健兒都勇壯地踏上保衛祖國的疆島！</p>
<p>年來記者讀許多靑年人或情熱的論著，都說中國軍隊抗日之情緒極高，尤以二十九軍為最；這種鼓吹雖然是在表明中國軍隊的情形，實際也暴露了這些軍隊的弱點。</p>
<p>我們知道，所謂情緒在心裏學上說來是感情的最激厲之激發，而不是即知的東西，外界的刺戟強，則能激發此種情緒之突發，但一旦有旁種力量而加以阻壓時，則情緒就如洪水流崩堤，瀢退盡了，然而和情緒相反，抗日意識實是最高的理想。意識越健全，抗日才越有把握，單單的情緒之高，是換來了平漢綫上敵兵們的消極；這種情形，我們不能深責兵士，而要責平日軍隊中政治訓練的薄弱，尤其富記者親身管窺到中央軍與某路軍的政治教養時，更有這種感覺。</p>
<p>平漢綫上不但散兵多，小綹和漢奸更多，我們的列車上單以被竊，就近十件，至于漢奸也捉了好幾個。這種情形一方面是象徵着北方政治勢力上的惡劣，同時也表現北方戰綫上的戰爭的困艱。</p>
<p>六時本有客車，但因特殊情形，缺乏車頭停開了，遂使記者找一小客棧暫憇，擬搭晚車赴井，但後來又傳說晚車也沒有了，今後是否尚有客車亦成問題，遂使記者心中惄然；暗念帶筆從戎，不遠千里的到了石家莊，都被拜絕在娘子關外，心中黯然，眞是萬思交迸</p>
<p>午後三時，忽然聽到了空襲的警報，記六和一個平津流广學生的旅伴，奔赴郊外躲避，來襲的飛機有二十三架左右，前後盤旋，拗執地向着車站電燈廠等投彈，事後調查，正太車站之石橋有少許毀壞外，其他毀壞若干路軌和房子，但電燈廠四無恙。</p>
<p>這次石家莊的空襲，是近一禮拜來的第一次，在九一八左右最利害。今日的空襲之目標在正太路而不在平漢路，實是表現日人已知我們昨夜在正太路上的行動；這無疑的，是漢奸們的恩賜；據旅店主人語記者，石家莊口為漢奸之大本營，每日就逮的有七八人。當今年九一八時，日機炸毀地窖十餘個，因為漢奸們都在避難洞口上，放置雨傘白衣之類。這些漢奸以推單輸車的為多，平漢路工人也有就逮的，因為交通界易於傳遞消息，致被敵人所利誘·</p>
<p>因之飛機的轟炸，正太路的晚車阻礙了，眞讓記者着急，麕集在车站上候車的難民，也被無車的消息而落胆；然而石家莊因轟炸而呈更悽慘與紊亂了。</p>
<p>像××的青年軍官向記者嘆道；唉！想不到北方的情形會這樣？民衆既無組織，又多固執，譬如這座被毀的石橋，如果在×　×，早就動員民衆，在剎時裹修起來了。</p>
<p>對於北方一切惡勢力的非難，祇要是年青人，是都能感到的，在旅館院子裹，中央軍的某營長向排長訓話，除告誡射擊衝鋒等戰術以外，并且還提報了二年平漢线上的作戰的痛心故事，記者對於這些故事實在不忍寫給讀者看。</p>
<p>在石家莊之日，是受着飛機的威脅，在石家莊之夜，是受着跳蚤的驚擾而一夜未眠。</p>
<p>正太路上</p>
<p>四點鐘離了坑，在九時半戒嚴的時候，奔赴車站，知道七八點鐘有輛客車，心中愉快得很，那末一潛過險峻的娘子關，記者就可以奔馳於民族解放的戰塲上了。</p>
<p>車到七時半進了站，八時駛行，車中擠得動顫不了；小如火柴盒的正太路車廂，就在疊山曲水之間蜿蜒而行·沿途的景色，和平綏路相伯仲，比起平漢等鐵路的一望平野之無聊，好得多了。</p>
<p>正太路上沒有可記的事情，祗有在楡次遇到空襲而停駛，這輛車是保守，狭小，緩慢，正象徵着山西的實貌。</p>
<p>到了太原，已是黑暗了，受到憲兵的搜查後，投奔青年會宿舍·在路上，看到黑暗的太原之街和憧憧的軍人之影</p>
<p>作沒月進娘子關之前，我曾懷着𦿭腔熱情，想帶些好的動聽的消息給讀者，但到了山西卻使我悲哀起來了，我在太原難住了一天多，但我聽到了許多可忿和悲哀的故事，我遇到了大公報記　　　君和我談起前綫的情况，使我明白了在新的時代之展開以前，切粉飾的行為，和固執的頑奮的東西，都將粉碎，所謂在這大動亂的坩堝之中，將製煉出新的眞實的東西。</p>
<p>本來是想在太原多住幾日，但因太原方面無緊急的事情，加之今天有到前綫去卡車，於是就離開每天遭空襲的太原奔赴××了。途中所見所聞，都足令人痛心，但我都捫住了心痛，在年靑的某路軍的同志們的歌聲裏，向着前綫走，我想，這一着有分曉，舊的𩒞固的總有休止崩潰的一日，同時我將看到新的光明的一面。</p>
<h3>滬戰特寫</h3>
<p>— 中央社隨軍記者王晉奇</p>
<p>一、羅店爭奪戰</p>
<p>八一三滬戰爆發之後我們忠勇的戰士後發先制、把虹口楊樹浦一帶敵人堅固的窠穴、緊聚的包團着、血戰旬日、使敵人幾乎透不過氣來、敵人速戰速决的迷夢、完全給我們粉碎了，於是敵人便變換他們的戰略、企圖在長江下游各口岸登陸、把戰綫延長、牽制我們在江灣和閘北的兵力、八月二十二日晚上、大批敵艦集泊在川沙口和獅子林一帶、施放烟幕強迫登岸、我們雖已在江邊配備了相當的兵力但是血肉之軀擋不住敵人猛烈的砲火、於是大量敵軍配備着新式鋒利的武器、由江邊向前衝進．我們守軍、雖忘卻一切艱困、抱定與陣地共存亡的决心和敵人死拼、終因衆寡縣殊、翌午、被敵軍衝進寶山獅子林月浦等處、而到達羅店、如果這時我們的援軍不能立刻趕到、不能把敵人堵截住、不能把敵人打回去、那末淞滬的戰事、便立刻要受到極大的影響、所以羅店的箏奪戰、實在是淞滬戰事的重要關鍵、素以用兵神速著名的總司令××將軍、在敵軍向羅店衝進的時候、立刻下令調集彭夏兩師、向羅店轉進、李師同嘉定方面急進彭帥的先頭部隊、很神速的在當天晚上趕到羅店、和敵人發生猛烈的遭遇戰、敵人雖以重兵用了最新式的武器、發揮猛烈的火力威脅我們、但是我們的戰士、沒有一個不在緊密的槍林彈雨之中、勇敢地挺進、衝入敵人陣地、前仆後繼地和敵人肉搏血戰、經過了差不多七八小時的鏖戰、終於把敵人的銳氣煞住、而給以重大的創傷、在敵人工兵上尉的屍體上搜出的一幅地圖和日記、我們知道這次敵人首先登陸的部隊是陸軍第四十三第四十七兩個聯隊，和工兵第十一聯隊這三個聯隊便是敵軍號稱最精銳的久留米師團的部隊、</p>
<p>二十四日、李廈兩師趕到羅店、我軍兵力益為雄厚了、便向敵人忘命的打過去、羅店附近的敵軍給我們完全肅淸了、除由李帥擔任羅店到瀏河一綫的防務之外、彭夏兩師又向西北挺進、敵人在羅店經過我軍這樣嚴重的打擊、兼以立足未穩、再不能擋阻我們的主力、所以我軍便乘勝追擊、收復了寶山獅子林月浦等處、</p>
<p>當然、敵人企圖奪取羅店來控制太倉嘉定、威脅我們閘北江灣綫的野心、決不因此而止、所以在二十五日的拂曉、敵人的後援部隊、又在石洞小川沙等處登岸了、由大批飛機和軍艦掩護之下、再向羅店方面衝進、這時我們在羅店的工事、還沒有建築得十分鞏固、彭夏兩師的部隊、又向西北方面挺進、李師因為防樓較長、在羅店的兵力也不算雄厚、同時羅店鎭被敵人飛機炸彈和兵艦砲彈像撒豆般的密集轟炸、所有的民房、差不多炸毀完了、尚未鞏固的陣地、也多被破壞、我們的守備隊、大部被迫退去、僅留一營的兵力、在這無險可憑的羅店鎭上苦守、追到晚上八時左右、李師在瀏河方面的部隊、急忙的調回一團兵力、山旅長蔡炳炎副旅長李維藩親自率領、立刻全集羅店附近原有的駐軍、乘着黑夜裏衝進羅店鎭、敵人雖有銳利的武器、總擋不住我們戰士忠勇的熱血、尤其蔡旅長李副旅長親臨陣地、身先士卒浴血抗戰、結果又把敵人打退了、可是、我們的忠勇的旅長和副旅長、在這一役裏為國捐軀了、這種壯烈的犧牲、多麼可歌可泣呢、</p>
<p>到了二十七日的晚上、我們第二次的部署、就是向川沙鎭進攻、還是由彭農兩師担任了這一個使命、一口氣把那邊的敵軍驅逐到江邊、而完全殲滅但是因為軍艦上的砲火太密、我們的部隊不能在江邊紥住、敵人再以新部隊登陸、向羅店作第三次的進攻、從二十八日上午八時左右起、一直到下午三時左右止、飛機和大砲的轟炸、簡直沒有一分鐘停止、飛沙走塵、籠罩了羅店全鎮、僅剩的房屋和陣地、受了最後的洗禮、我們忠勇的戰士還是苦守着、使敵人不敢輕易衝進、一直到了薄暮、敵人更以密集機關槍和小鋼砲以及坦克車攻進我們陣地、我們的守軍、經過了相當時間的抵抗和壯烈的犧牲之後、在敵人的火力嚴重威脅之下、不得不退出了羅店、這時我霍師剛從××方面開到嘉定、便奉令立即開赴前方增援、每一個兵士都興高彩烈的踏上保衛國土的神聖征途、轟轟烈烈的衝進火綫、同時彭師的主力、也奉令向西轉進、協同霍師向羅店立即開始第三次的反攻、經過五小時的血戰、衝鋒陷陣不下十餘次、彭師出東南向西北、在夜色蒼茫中、奮勇奪回了羅店鎭的南半部、霍師也由西向東夾擊、敵人在那方面已佈置了二道鐵絲網、攔阻我軍前進、我軍奮不顧身、接連破壞了敵人的鐵絲網、衝入羅店以北的長橋、那裏有敵人清耳司令部、四週有更嚴密的防禦工事、裏邊、敵人的一個指揮官、被我們擊斃、還俘虜了幾十個敵人、殺死的敵人更是無算、奪獲敵方小銅砲一門、輕重機關槍八架、手槍圖表望遠鏡、乘馬及脚踏車等各一、文件很多、可是我們也遭遇了相當的犧牲、</p>
<p>這一次的搏鬥、因爲彭霍兩師受通信的障碍、以致雙方不能相互策應、同時霍師在深夜裏爲河流所阻、所以沒有能竟全功、到二九日以後、便在羅店鎭各佔半部的形勢之下、往復爭奪、日夜不停的續演下去、有一度被我軍把羅店鎭三面包圍了起來、我們應該可以把敵人完全殲滅、後以右翼陣地變動了些不得不把包圍着的東邊的陣地、向後撤退數百公尺、從這一次羅店的爭奪戰、使敵人充分地認識了我軍的作戰精神、不敢蠢動、這樣的局勢、直爭持到現在、兩軍還是在羅店負隅對峙着、</p>
<p>最近旬日來、敵我在羅店鎭的爭奪戰、敵方是用了全力進攻的、除了大量的飛機和重砲轟炸威脅外、步兵的數量也極雄厚、我們所發現的敵方番號、有二十二·四十三·四十四·四十七四個聯隊、總計登陸的敵人、至少在一個師團以上、他們在海陸空軍的立體進攻之下、原想一舉而把我們擊退、可是我軍充分發揮了應戰的精神、突擊的戰術、旺盛的士氣、忠勇的熱血，這些力量的結晶、比鐵還要堅强、敵人的企圖、給我們粉碎了、敵人給我箝制在一隅、已經知道要想衝進我們的陣地是一件艱困的工作、（十月十九日寄）</p>

<h3>寫給戰時靑年</h3>
<p>— 郭我力</p>
<p>要在日帝國主義的箝制下，從事民族解放運動，工作異常艱鉅！决非局部的戰鬥力可收成效；必須揭起動員全民族的力量的旗幟，才能從榨壓下反抗出來。</p>
<p>這旗幟下，尤其是有訓練有組織的靑年，為其骨幹，而地位的重耍與職責的艱苦，無出其右了，似此我們應該如何警惕自己，鞭策自己，黽勉亢奮，作這運動中有力的砥石，故自身不能不有深刻的檢討，充分的準備，這裏所談的卽全面抗戰中我靑年應有的幾點普通修養！</p>
<p>一·一切偉大事業都是基於精强力壯；如果身體孱弱，精神萎靡，作事必定“虎頭蛇尾”，不能貫澈始終，抗戰中事務繁忙，旦夕役勞，若任其虧耗，而不注意培養新的體力，焉能“任重致遠？”</p>
<p>二·學識為智慧的泉源，學識充實，能使氣質變化，腦力靈活，認識淸楚，手叚高超，發揮精明強幹的作用，始有偉大成就，戰時環境復雜，應付浩繁，尤當隨時多讀刊物及博覽關於救亡有益的專著，最好“抗戰不忘讀書，讀書不忘抗戰，”兩者輪迴並進，俾不斷產生新的智慧，與詭譎多端，千變萬化的侵略陣綫相周旋，而不致手慌脚亂，窮於應對了。</p>
<p>三·靑年往往容易隨波逐流，誤入歧途，這是沒有固定的中心思想，把握不往“心猿意馬”的念頭，現在我們需耍個堅強的抗戰陣綫，靑年在這陣綫裏，必須確定以救國主義的三民主義為中心思想，堅决“有敵無我，有我無敵”為民族奮鬥而犧牲的信念，要不為一切惡勢力和漢奸所誘惑，所動搖。</p>
<p>四·事務繁忙，行動愈貴敏捷，有敏捷的行動，則臨機應變，增進工作的效率，當不難了，此刻硬要一個人負担幾個的任務，向前邁進，才能從速完成神聖的使命，若要使行動敏捷，必須於工作時，隨時當心，自加檢省，力戒怠惰，遲鈍，久之，自能養成。</p>
<p>五·靑年正在血氣方剛的時候，每每抹煞理智，側重感情，“好高鶩遠”，“目無餘子”，無形中暴露了囂張，驕傲的弱點，容易引起外界的惡劣印象，這是涵養功夫的欠缺，所以不能不隨時檢點，有則力戒，無則加勉，抗戰工作是全民應盡的責任，决非屬於任何局部的職守，譬如有錢的不肯出錢，我們勸募必須從精誠的心理與和靄的態度，去設法感動它，斷不能就出於唾責的低級行動。</p>
<p>六·戰事猛烈，敵機橫行，我們出入於槍林彈雨中，必須膽大心細，提精會神，隨時隨地防衛自身和保護他人，極盡理智以防備敵人的襲擊，免作無謂犧牲，若為救護前綫受傷戰士及苦難民衆的執役，或加入戰鬥而殉難，這是理智的“捨身取義”的必然結果，决非輕妄而受意外可比，所以事前我們對防空防毒的戰時智識和技術，必須學習嫺熟，臨時才能運用，應付裕如。</p>
<p>七·最後我們耍做到“有公忘我”的偉大修養，祇知有公，不知有我，自能克服一切以我為出發的“風頭主義”和“五分鐘的熱度”而走入實際服務的內層，以“鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已”從公的志節，更可以排除，敷衍，苟且的惡劣因子，故忠實於職守，乃為今日抗戰中的靑年，尤當注意的。</p>

        <h1>1937.10.25</h1>
<p>Our Forces Firmly Defend Dachang, Deploying Main Force North of Zoumatang</p>
<p>We Hold the Line from Hujiazhai to Jiejingzhai; the Enemy's Southern Advance Along Maqiaozhai Has Been Difficult to Sustain; West of Chenjiaxiang, We Have Deployed Defenses Along the Bank</p>
<p>The enemy on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal, directly probing Dachang along both sides of the Shanghai-Taiyuan Highway, relying on the cover of its aircraft, artillery, and mechanized units, broke through our positions at Maqiaozhai and continued to advance southward. Our forces have deployed solid fortifications in new positions and have mobilized fresh troops to block them closely. Therefore, the enemy's advance has not reached one kilometer. They were immediately met with a brave counterattack from our army. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and have been unable to continue their advance. The enemy in the direction of Gejiapailou and Huanggang also launched a fierce attack southwards simultaneously. Both sides engaged in an unprecedented main force battle. From dawn yesterday morning until late at night, there was almost no pause. Our army is now holding the line from Hujiazhai to Jiejingzhai, about 700 meters north of Zoumatang, to defend Dachang Town. If the enemy comes to attack, they will be dealt a heavy blow. To the west of Miaohang, we are firmly defending the line about 500 meters from the highway. Our spokesperson declared yesterday during a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists that although the enemy's artillery fire is extremely fierce, our army will never retreat slightly. If the enemy continues its old tricks and destroys Dachang Town completely, we will still fight bravely on the scorched earth, as the Battle of Luodian is one example. This proves that our army is determined to resist. Rumors that we will abandon Dachang and Jiangwan are completely groundless. Furthermore, our position in Chenjiaxiang on the north bank of the Wenzaobang Canal was broken through by the enemy's fierce artillery fire the day before yesterday. Our army immediately moved west about 600 meters and deployed strong fortifications on the west bank of a small stream. The enemy continued to attack that night, launching several fierce assaults, all of which were repelled by us. However, the enemy's attempt to look west towards Nanxiang is now becoming more active. Fierce battles are expected in the coming days. Our army has deployed strong troops in that area and will not allow the enemy to make easy progress.</p>
<h3>Dachang's Military Fortifications Are Impregnable</h3>
<p>Any Enemy Advances Will Inevitably Face an Unprecedentedly Fierce Counterattack; The Battle in Zhabei Is Not Affected in the Slightest</p>
<p>A report from the Central News Agency's war correspondent at 12:00 midnight on the 24th stated that the fighting on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal is gradually shifting southwards, and Dachang is gradually becoming tense. The reporter specially visited a military commander to inquire about his observations on the future of the war and what impact it would have on the Zhabei area. According to him, after the enemy stealthily crossed the Wenzaobang Canal on the 6th of this month, they originally planned to take Dachang in one fell swoop and occupy it by the 15th, so that our troops in Zhabei and Jiangwan would feel threatened and retreat. On the 12th, they encountered a major blow from our army, and the fourth general offensive completely failed. They retreated to the canal bank. Only because the retreat route was not cut off were the enemy able to greatly reinforce and launch another general offensive. Although the enemy's traces are gradually shifting southwards, there is still a considerable distance from Dachang. In total, in the 20 days of bloody battles on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal, the enemy has exerted all its efforts in hard fighting in our poorly fortified positions, encountering strong resistance everywhere. At the cost of nearly 10,000 casualties, they have exchanged for one or two kilometers of positions. They cannot boast of victory. The fortifications on our side in Dachang have been under construction since the outbreak of the Shanghai war and, after more than two months of intensified replenishment, can be described as impregnable and can be defended to the death. We are now standing by, waiting for a major battle. If the enemy attacks Dachang, they will inevitably encounter an unprecedented major blow, without a doubt. Recalling that when the enemy landed at Xiaochuansha on August 23 and advanced to Luodian, our army used temporary fortifications to engage the enemy and inflicted repeated heavy blows. Two months later, they are still fighting fiercely in that area, preventing the enemy from advancing. The future of the Dachang war is something that the enemy will find even more difficult to handle, which can be imagined. Furthermore, when our army retreated to the first line of defense on September 13, it was generally believed that our troops in Zhabei would also retreat. Today, it has been fully proven that the speculation at the time was wrong. Now, if we still make such speculations, the error will be the same. Therefore, the Zhabei area is not affected in the slightest, which is extremely obvious. Even if we take a step back and say that Dachang is also lost, our army has long adopted a step-by-step, solid and steady strategy and will fight to the death, and will never easily give up Zhabei. The enemy's dream of quickly resolving the Shanghai war will never be achieved. The future of the war is still optimistic, and there is no need to worry. The military commander then said that the enemy's strategy is now very clear. In addition to heading south towards Dachang, they are also planning to attack Nanxiang from Chenjiaxiang in the west. This kind of attempt will also encounter the same difficulties, which goes without saying. Regarding the Miaohang and Jiangwan areas, our army's positions have always stood still and will continue to be firmly defended without retreating.</p>
<p>Our Forces Moved South Yesterday at Jijiaxiangzhai</p>
<p>A report from the Central News Agency's war correspondent at Dachang at 10:30 PM on the 24th stated that west of the Shanghai-Taiyuan Highway and southeast of Gejiapailou, our original position at Jijiaxiangzhai was slightly moved south yesterday after Maqiaozhai was broken through by the enemy. After the enemy bombarded it all night, the enemy finally arrived there at 2:00 PM this afternoon with 2,000 troops and moved south.</p>
<p>The Enemy Attacked Yemaodun and Were Severely Beaten</p>
<p>A report from the Central News Agency's war correspondent at Dachang at 10:30 PM on the 24th stated that the enemy in the Yangbeizhai area attacked our army's alert line at Yemaodun at dawn, attempting to probe Miaohang. They were met with brave resistance from our army. Seeing that we were prepared, the enemy did not dare to advance easily. In the afternoon, they increased their strength and launched another fierce attack. We still gave them a head-on blow, and by dusk, they retreated without success. Also, small groups of enemy soldiers fired and harassed us in the Wang area west of Duanpu Bridge. We responded calmly, and the enemy retreated.</p>
<h3>Our Army Still Firmly Defends Guangfu</h3>
<p>The Enemy Continues to Charge But Has Been Repelled; Artillery Fire Was Extremely Intense on the Entire Guangfu Line Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Guangfu Town is still being firmly defended by our army. The enemy launched a fierce attack to the west the night before, and after a fierce battle until late at night, although the enemy made slight progress, they ultimately failed to break through our position in the town. From yesterday morning to night, the enemy continued to attack, but after our army's brave counterattacks, the enemy has been repelled.</p>
<p>A report from the Central News Agency's war correspondent at Guangfu at 10:30 AM on the 24th stated that from last night until this morning, the enemy's artillery fire was extremely intense towards our Luodian-Jiading highway, both north and south, as well as the entire Guangfu line of positions. 300-400 enemy soldiers launched several fierce attacks towards the front of our Xiao Jiazhai position under the cover of artillery fire. After our army calmly responded, many enemies were killed. The enemy ultimately did not succeed, and the artillery fire gradually stopped at dawn.</p>
<p>A report from the Central News Agency's war correspondent at Jiangwan at 12:00 noon on the 24th stated that artillery fire was fierce on both sides of the Liuhang-Dachang highway on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal, without stopping all night. Our army also returned fire with heavy artillery. The entire front line from Guangfu, Chenjiahang, Gejiapailou to Maqiaozhai east of the highway was shrouded in artillery fire. The enemy and our army also fought with all their might, fighting fiercely all night. First, our three strongholds at Chenjiahang, Maqiaozhai, Luzhai, and Gaozhuangqiaozhai were broken through by the enemy. Then, Xinmuqiao and Shiqiao, etc., in front of Guangfu, which we had recovered through counterattacks, were too prominent, so they were automatically withdrawn to their original positions. After our army's brave counterattacks on the entire line from Chenjiahang to Maqiaozhai, there were advances and retreats. However, the enemy repeatedly attacked the breakthrough point and tried hard to hold it. Because our counterattack made no progress, we deployed strong fortifications on the spot and stood by, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Occupation of Fudan University Has No Military Significance</h3>
<p>Fierce Battles Took Place on Shuichan Road and Xiangyin Road Yesterday; The Enemy Repeatedly Attacked Zhabei But Were All Repelled by Us</p>
<p>A report from the Central News Agency's war correspondent at Jiangwan at 12:00 midnight on the 24th stated that although the Fudan University campus is open and large, it is a military stronghold, but because the target is too large and easily subject to enemy artillery fire, our army has stationed powerful troops in its northwest for a month to control it as a front line alert. At dawn today, the enemy suddenly attacked with a battalion of troops under the cover of tanks, forcing our outposts to retreat and occupying the school. This is not of great military significance, but because the enemy has always been able to destroy our cultural institutions, this magnificent and beautiful school will inevitably suffer.</p>
<p>A report from the Central News Agency's war correspondent at Jiangwan at 12:00 midnight on the 24th stated that at about 3:00 PM this afternoon, our army's attacking troops from the Tanjiazhai area encountered the vanguard of the attacking enemy on Shuichan Road. Contact began, and they exchanged machine gun and rifle fire. They held each other until about 7:00 PM, when both sides charged with large groups, engaged in hand-to-hand combat for about an hour. The enemy suffered more than 30 casualties, and we also suffered slight losses.</p>
<p>A report from the Central News Agency's war correspondent at Jiangwan at 12:30 AM on the 24th stated that yesterday evening, several tanks were active in formation on Xiangyin Road. Our army maintained strict vigilance. Until about 2:00 AM this morning, the enemy did cover three companies of infantry to attack. We attacked from the West and East Sports Association Roads, setting up a network of machine gun fire to press forward on the enemy. They came and went, holding each other until 6:00 AM, and then retreated to their original positions.</p>
<p>Our Army Raided the Japanese Cemetery at Night</p>
<p>A report from the Central News Agency's war correspondent at Zhabei at 12:00 midnight on the 24th stated that at about 8:00 PM, our army attacked from Fangjia Wood Bridge, sneaking along the south bank of the Yokohama River, taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness to cross the Baziqiao Bridge and pounced on the Japanese cemetery. With a shout of killing, grenades were fired simultaneously. The enemy soldiers were terrified and ran away, but it was too late. Many were killed instantly. With our goal achieved, we safely returned to our position.</p>
<p>A report from the Central News Agency's war correspondent at Zhabei at 12:30 AM on the 24th stated that at 3:00 AM this morning (the 24th), about two companies of the enemy attacked Dongbaoxing Road and Qiujiang Road. Our army bravely fought back, rushing to North Sichuan Road, joining the sentries stationed at various alleyways, and engaging the enemy with intensive flanking fire from machine guns and direct-firing cannons. The enemy gradually could not hold on and retreated at 6:30 AM. Also, more than 200 enemies attacked from the No. 63 Garden at 1:30 AM, attempting to probe our Baziqiao position. Our army confronted the enemy along both banks of the Yokohama River, killing many enemy outposts. At about 4:30 AM, the enemy's main force continued to attack south. Our army also bravely rushed out, facing each other with bayonets, fighting and killing nearly a hundred enemies. By dawn, the enemy had not succeeded.</p>
<p>Enemy Captain Izumizaka Was Killed in Action</p>
<p>A report from the Central News Agency's war correspondent at Zhabei at 12:00 midnight on the 24th stated that during our army's surprise attack on North Sichuan Road on the night of the 14th of this month, our army bravely rushed out and threw grenades fiercely. Enemy Company Commander Izumizaka was hit in the face and severely injured by our attack and died of his injuries. Izumizaka was from Fukui Prefecture.</p>
<p>The Enemy Spreads Poison Powder in Zhabei</p>
<p>The Central News Agency's garrison in Zhabei has reported that enemy planes have been spreading black powder in the Wanjiazhai and Wuwangzhai areas for several days. Our soldiers did not pay attention at first, and after drinking the water, they all suffered from poisoning, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The enemy's violation of public law and disregard for humanity have been further exemplified here. Our military officials have collected evidence and will announce it to the outside world.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Sixth Reinforcement Army Continues to Arrive</h3>
<p>Enemy Warships Continue to Transport Bullets and Fuel; Aircraft Carriers and Large Torpedoes</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, of the enemy's Sixth Reinforcement Army's Third Division, two groups, totaling about 10,000 men, have already arrived in Shanghai. It is now planned that a third group of the enemy's 11th Division from Zentsuji, about 15,000 men, will continue to arrive in Shanghai within days. In addition, around the 27th of this month, about 2,000 more enemy reinforcements (the fourth group) will arrive in Shanghai on enemy destroyers *Hayakaze* and Transport No. 180 (this group is an elite unit from Korea). Around the 29th of this month, about 3,000 infantry of the puppet Manchukuo army's Qiang Haipeng's unit will arrive in Shanghai on transport ships such as the *Sanyo Maru*, which were converted from enemy merchant ships.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, at about 6:00 AM this morning (the 24th), another enemy transport ship *Shiritoko* sailed to Shanghai and docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Pier, carrying more than 1,000 boxes of bullets and a large amount of coal. In addition, there are four other transport ships converted from enemy merchant ships sailing to Shanghai: *Nishiyama Maru*, *Wakasa Maru*, *Ryuko Maru*, and *Chikugo Maru*, which are docked at the Huangpu, Osaka, and Huishan piers and have not yet sailed out. Yesterday morning, a large number of shells, fuel, fodder, and other military supplies were unloaded ashore.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, it is confirmed that there were originally two enemy aircraft carriers anchored outside the Wusongkou. One of them has now sailed away, and only one remains, still anchored outside the port. The name of the ship is *Chidostze*, which was built in 1935 and can carry 80 aircraft. In addition, there is also a huge enemy battleship *Mutzi* anchored outside the port. The ship has a displacement of 27,000 tons.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, military sources report that two large enemy torpedo boats and one cruiser, and destroyer No. 30, suddenly arrived the other day. The name of the destroyer is *Yayoi*, and the commander of the enemy's Second Air Group is stationed on the ship. The two torpedo boats are both stocked with a large number of mines, ready to be released at any time. The names of the two ships are *Ohimoshima* and *Itsuknshim*. The former is the residence of the commander of the enemy's First Fleet. As for the other cruiser, its name is *Washizaki*, and it has three aircraft parked on it. All four of the above ships are currently anchored at the Qiujiang Pier.</p>
<h3>Provoking World Peace! Enemy Planes Strafe British Troops</h3>
<p>One British Soldier Killed, One Wounded, and Two War Horses Killed; The Enemy Army's Arrogant Actions May Backfire</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy planes were particularly violent yesterday. From dawn to dusk, the sounds of firing and explosions were endless. At 3:35 PM, when enemy planes were dropping bombs in western Shanghai, they flew low to a height of 1,535 meters and aimed at the British soldiers stationed on Kaixuan Road, strafing them with machine guns. By the time the British soldiers noticed and dodged, one had been killed and one wounded (the deceased was named Michael McKeown, 28 years old), and two war horses were killed by the bullets. Enemy planes had previously wounded British diplomats twice with gunfire, and the British negotiations have not yet been concluded. This time, they have again used violence against British troops. Their arrogant actions are clearly a provocation against world peace. Doing many unrighteous things may backfire.</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the enemy planes strafing with machine guns on Kaixuan Road at 3:35 PM yesterday, killing British soldiers, it is now known that the victim was British soldier Michael McKeown. Another British soldier was also hit by gunfire, but fortunately hit the cigarette case in his pocket, so he was not injured. Another German man was riding a horse passing by, and his horse was also killed, but the man was unharmed. When the enemy planes wreaked havoc and killed Michael McKeown, the British soldiers stationed there retaliated with machine guns for self-defense, but did not hit the enemy planes. It is heard that the Japanese side has apologized to the British military authorities for this incident, but still adheres to its consistent cunning strategy, claiming that it was a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Our Planes Raid</h3>
<p>Last night, our air force again went to Shanghai to fight, flying over Shanghai several times. The first time was at 11:20 PM, the second time was at 12:15 AM this morning, and then at 1:45 AM and 3:30 AM, they circled several times. Our brave and skilled flying generals took advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness and dropped several bombs in the Yangshupu area. A red light was seen rising from the northeast, soaring into the sky. Our planes then left safely.</p>
<h3>The Regular Army Has Been Fully Mobilized; The Enemy Drafts Reservists into the Military</h3>
<p>The Domestic Forced Conscription Causes Widespread Complaints; Labor Societies and Other Parties Oppose the War</p>
<p>[Suzhou] According to reports, since the enemy army launched the war of aggression, it has suffered heavy casualties in our fierce resistance on all fronts. To reinforce, there is no regular army in the country that can be mobilized. They have no choice but to change their reserve service, from the age of 18 to 55, and all are enlisted to supplement the forces. Many fathers and sons are in the same camp, causing public grievances. Some even pretend to be crazy, commit murder and go to jail to be sentenced, hoping to avoid military service. Also, most of the workers in the factories are forced to enlist, which greatly affects the ordnance factories (Central News Agency electric dispatch on the 24th).</p>
<p>[Suzhou] According to overseas Chinese returning from Japan, at the beginning of the war, the enemy government deceived the people, saying that it could be resolved in the shortest time. For the conscription of people, they first issued a blue conscription order. If the conscription period is exceeded, they will force it with a red order. Among the conscripts, there are people from all walks of life who are more respected, reluctantly enlisting, without any fighting spirit. Recently, due to the prolonged war and frequent conscription, the people are full of complaints, and the society is extremely uneasy. More than 600 kinds of imported goods are now prohibited except for military supplies. Due to the cessation of trade with China and the impact of the boycott of Japanese goods in various countries, the export goods have no sales, so the enemy's Labor League is quite strongly opposed to the war. The ruling faction and the young military faction are now pushing the responsibility for the war on each other, and the time for internal collapse can be predicted (Central News Agency electric dispatch on the 24th).</p>
<h3>Hao and Liu's Coffins Arrived in Hubei Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Hankou] The coffins of the late Hao Mengling, the border commander, and the late Liu Jiaqi, the division commander, arrived at the Dazhimen Railway Station at 8:30 AM on the 24th. About 4,000 people from all walks of life in Wuhan, including leaders, military police, and boy scouts, held a public memorial service at the station. He Chengjun represented Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as the presiding officer. After the ceremony, at about 9:00 AM, the coffins departed from Dazhimen Railway Station for Wuchang. The procession of coffin bearers extended for several miles, and no less than 100,000 people along the way took off their hats and stood in respectful silence. Those who offered road sacrifices were also endless. At 11:00 AM, the coffins crossed the Han River. At 12:00 PM, a telegram was sent to Wuchang. Representatives from the provincial government and other agencies held a memorial service at the pier. The headquarters set up a road sacrifice at Pingvalve Road. At 2:50 PM in the afternoon, they arrived at Hongshan and were temporarily placed in the pine forest on the upper right side of the Tongmu Cemetery Road. He Chengjun, the acting chairman, and others held a memorial service again. The ceremony was completed and dismissed at 3:30 PM. All three towns of Wuhan lowered their flags to mourn on this day, and the situation was very solemn (Central News Agency electric dispatch on the 24th).</p>
<h3>More Enemy Warships on the Yangtze River at Wolf Mountain</h3>
<p>Nantong: The number of enemy warships on the Yangtze River at Wolf Mountain has increased to eight. There has been no activity on the Chao Bridge. Enemy planes spied along the river at 9:00 AM on the 24th (Special Dispatch on the 24th).</p>
<h3>Enemy Shells Injured People This Morning</h3>
<p>Pierced the Window Lattice and Fell Beside the Bed; Hit the Right Leg and Blood Gushed Like a Spring</p>
<p>At about 0:10 this morning, our planes came to Shanghai for a night raid. Enemy warships fired anti-aircraft guns indiscriminately. Yao Wei, a woman from Jiangbei living at No. 226 Xinzha Road, was sleeping in bed when suddenly an anti-aircraft shell pierced the glass window and fell directly beside the bed, hitting her right leg, and blood gushed like a spring. She was then accompanied to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Land, Sea, and Air Forces Hold Exercises</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou] Foreign sources report that Hong Kong will hold major exercises for five days starting on the 25th. Warships, submarines, and naval aircraft berthed in the port will participate. The land artillery batteries will also conduct exercises for three days starting on the 28th (Central News Agency electric dispatch on the 24th).</p>
<h3>China Electric Company Ceases Joint Venture</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The China Electric Company was organized as a Sino-US joint venture, and its purpose was to establish its own factory to manufacture various electrical machinery and materials to supply China's telephone and telegraph needs. On October 20 of the sixth year of the Republic of China (1917), the Ministry of Communications signed a contract with the American Western Electric Company, stipulating a term of 20 years. The contract stated that if one party did not want to renew the contract, it must notify the other party in writing one year before the expiration. From the date of signing the contract, up to January 19 of this year, the contract term has expired. It is now heard that because the company has not been able to manage its various undertakings in accordance with the spirit of the contract since it was established, the Ministry of Communications has decided not to continue the contract after its expiration. It has formally declared to the American company in writing, and notified the company and the Shanghai office of the China Electric Company to take care of the liquidation and cease operations, and prepare for liquidation, and reported the circumstances to the Executive Yuan for record (Central News Agency electric dispatch on the 24th).</p>

<p>Date: 1937.10.25</p>
<p>Shanghai West</p>
<p>In the Shanghai West area, around 9 AM yesterday, six enemy planes reconnoitered back and forth over Zhongshan Road, then dropped multiple bombs near Datong University, causing significant damage to Datong University's school buildings and Datong New Village houses. A male child surnamed Ma was injured. At 12:50 PM, another enemy plane dropped sulfur bombs on the Yigong Yarn Factory, owned by British merchants, on Old Baosheng Road. The bombs ignited a fire, destroying many factory buildings, but the fire was quickly extinguished. Subsequently, the plane frequently flew low, strafing with machine guns, fortunately without injuring anyone. At 2:10 PM, three planes again reconnoitered over Zhongshan Road, then dropped four bombs, destroying Bridge No. 3 on Zhongshan Road and injuring one person.

The Zhenbei Bridge was also destroyed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, starting from 6 AM at dawn, enemy planes launched a large-scale bombing of Shanghai West. In the morning, over 20 enemy planes dropped over 130 bombs and strafed pedestrians with machine guns in the area north of the Suzhou River in Beixinjing, Zhenru, and Yangjia Bridge, destroying over 30 civilian houses and injuring over 40 civilians. In the afternoon, another 30 enemy planes came and bombed the area north of Zhoujia Bridge and Zhongshan Road Datong University in Shanghai West. The dormitories of Datong University and the classrooms of the middle school department were all bombed and destroyed. Bridge No. 3 on Zhongshan Road was also bombed and cut off. Many civilians were killed or injured, moaning by the roadside, a tragic sight. Zheng Yunkun, the captain of the 10th Emergency Rescue Team of the Red Cross, Tao Yayu, and team members Wang Guochang, Ge Shangyong, Jin Boqin, and others, numbering over ten, braved the enemy's bombing and machine gun fire to risk their lives to send the injured to various hospitals for treatment.</p>
<p>Yesterday, enemy planes madly bombed the area north of Shanghai West Fanwangdu. Sixteen, twelve, nine, and six enemy planes took turns bombing and strafing with machine guns from 10 AM to 6 PM. Among them, the six bombings at 10:30 AM, 10:30 AM, 1:30 PM, 2:25 PM, 10:45 AM, 3:15 PM, and 4:20 PM were the most intense, dropping a total of one to two hundred heavy bombs in places such as Ji Jia Ku, Xu Jia Zhai, Hua Jia Nong, Jin Jia Xiang, Xu Lu Jia Zhai, Guan Xiang, Datong University, Zhongshan Bridge, behind Wu Jia Garden, Lin Jia Gang, and Du Jia Zhai. Each time, as many as twelve enemy planes dropped one bomb simultaneously, causing the sounds of explosions to resonate far and wide. Among them, the three villages of Ji Jia Ku, Guan Xiang, and Lin Jia Gang were the most tragically bombed, with each village destroying two to thirty houses. Other villages destroyed houses ranging from ten to four. The number of civilians killed or injured in Ji Jia Ku alone was already thirty to forty. It is still difficult to determine the number of other deaths and injuries, but it should be at least over two hundred. Many people were also killed or injured by machine gun fire. Villagers who hid in the reeds in the fields were also not spared. From Xiaoshadu in the east to Zhongshan Road along the Suzhou River, no place was spared from bombing and shooting. Lin Jia Gang and Guan Xiang were bombed and caught fire, but the fires were quickly extinguished. Debris and ruins were everywhere. At Datong University and Du Jia Zhai, enemy planes repeatedly strafed with machine guns for over three hours. At 1:45 PM, they bombed the Zhongshan Bridge on the Suzhou River, with three enemy planes dropping bombs simultaneously. Two bombs landed on the bridge, causing severe damage and preventing vehicles from passing. Enemy planes dropped over a hundred steel bars, each over two feet long, near Liwa and Lita Village behind Du Jia Zhai and Datong University, for unknown reasons. People in the reconnaissance planes circling over Xiaoshadu, Caojiadu, and Fanwangdu could be seen clearly. Several fighter planes flew high to provide cover. The sound of planes rattling, bombs booming, and guns firing filled the air in Shanghai West all day long. Residents throughout the area were severely threatened. Many shops have closed their doors and ceased business.</p>
<p>Also, at noon yesterday, an enemy plane circled over the town of Minhang for over ten minutes, then dropped hundreds of absurd leaflets, about six inches long and four inches wide, which fluttered in the wind. Residents of the town, knowing that these were the enemy's tricks, ignored them and no one picked them up. Also, in the area of Wujiaxiang Qianliangmiao and other towns on the Shanghai-Minhang Road, an enemy plane dropped many similar leaflets around 11 AM yesterday. Those who picked them up scoffed at them and immediately tore them up, showing only that the enemy's sinister efforts were in vain.</p>
<p>At 4:15 PM yesterday, when enemy planes were bombing in the Shanghai West area, Huang Ma, an old woman from Zhenru on Binlang Road, 45 years old, was shot in the left arm by machine gun fire from an enemy plane. Her husband, Huang Atao, was also shot in both arms, and his right arm was broken. At the same time, Lu Adi, a villager from Zhenbei Road, was injured in the left arm by a bomb. Also, at 6:20 PM in the evening, when enemy planes were bombing in the Beixinjing area, a boy surnamed Kang had both legs severely injured by a bomb. Also, a civilian named Zhou Abao, 36 years old, was passing through Zhongshan Road when he was injured in both feet by an enemy bomb, and his ankles were broken, leaving him disabled. All were taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment by the rescue team.</p>
<p>Pudong</p>
<p>In the Pudong area, around 6 AM yesterday, an enemy plane dropped bombs in the Dongyangjing and Yangjiazhai areas, injuring three residents. Around 4 PM, another three enemy planes dropped multiple bombs in Yangjiadu. In addition, over ten enemy planes also went to Dachang and Nankai yesterday to wreak havoc continuously, destroying countless civilian houses, but causing no military losses to us.</p>
<p>Around 8 AM yesterday, three enemy planes dropped one bomb in the Beixu Jiazhai area of Pudong, destroying six farmers' houses numbered 6 and 7. They turned to Nanxu Jiazhai and dropped two bombs, destroying twelve or thirteen farmers' houses. At 8:30 AM, they went to Fangjia Tomb and dropped two bombs, destroying three tomb houses, and slightly opening the tombs. Around 1 PM in the afternoon, Gong Weihong (24 years old) and Yu Shanzhang (20 years old), both from Pudong, members of the 10th Red Cross Rescue Team, were wearing uniforms and going to the Qichang Pier in Pudong for a meeting when they were seen by enemy ship soldiers, who shot at them with rifles. Gong was hit in the left shoulder, penetrating the right shoulder, and fell to the ground injured. At this time, Yu saw his companion injured and immediately went forward to help him up, but the enemy ship behind him opened fire with machine guns, bullets raining down like pearls. Yu Shanzhang was shot five or six times in the back, with the bullets not exiting, and he also collapsed, in a very dangerous situation. They were then transported across the river by boat to Renji Hospital for treatment. At 5 PM in the evening, an enemy seaplane dropped another bomb near Dijiazhai, which landed in a field, so no one was injured. Also, the day before yesterday at 4 PM, six enemy seaplanes destroyed part of the Catholic Church in Zhangjialou, Pudong, and also affected 45 houses in Xizhen, killing two men and injuring five villagers, including Zhang Ni, Zhang Debao, Xian Yao, Yu Xinquan, and Yu Zhang. The head bishop of the church believed that enemy planes dared to indiscriminately bomb non-combatant missionary institutions, which was not allowed by international law, and had reported the detailed situation of the damage to the General Church, so as to appeal to the Catholic Church around the world.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Huang, who had just come to Shanghai from Nanhui yesterday, the tragic situation of enemy planes bombing the area for days was as follows: ㊀ Longwangmiao Town was the most tragic, with fifteen houses in the entire town being bombed and many stone bridges being blown up, making it difficult for rickshaws to travel. ㊁ Beicai Town was bombed four times in succession. The first time it fell on the south bank of Hongqiao, destroying more than 20 houses and killing or injuring more than 30 people. The second time it fell on Dongjie, destroying several houses. The third time it fell on Beijie, destroying the residence of local dignitary Gao Defu. The fourth time it fell in the Yizhong in the west of the town, destroying dozens of coffins. ㊂ Zhangjiangzha Town. At 3 p.m. on the 21st of this month, three planes came and dropped six bombs.

The Lindao Temple in the northwest of the town was also completely destroyed, and one nun was killed or injured.</p>
<p>Zhabei</p>
<p>In the Zhabei area, starting from 6:30 AM yesterday, there were fifteen enemy planes, divided into five teams, each with three planes, dropping bombs in various places. They left around 11 AM. The areas around our North Station, Qiujiang Road, Baoshan Road, and Gonghe New Road were bombed a total of more than 40 times, destroying more than 30 civilian houses. Starting from 1 PM in the afternoon, another six enemy planes took turns bombing in teams, leaving only in the evening. In addition to continuing to destroy more than ten of our civilian houses, there was no other damage.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were more enemy planes than in the past, and they flew very high, so the buzzing sound was constant all day long. It is estimated that the bombing in various parts of Zhabei was carried out three times each in the morning and afternoon. Around 2 PM in the afternoon, three enemy planes dropped six bombs each at the southern end of the library across from the printing house of the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road, at the railway intersection on Baoyuan Road, and at the eastern railway intersection of the North Railway Station Building.

It is estimated that no less than one hundred bombs were dropped throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Battalion Commander Zhang Died for His Country</h3>
<p>Since participating in the battle against Japan on the Jinghu Line, the officers and soldiers of our Army's ××× Division have been determined to sacrifice themselves for the country. Since February, they have fought bravely against the enemy, and the enemy has never been able to enter the division's position. On the 19th of last month, the enemy launched an attack on Sucun with a superior force of three companies. Zhang Yimo, the lieutenant colonel battalion commander of the division, was ordered to fight the enemy with a company of soldiers. Battalion Commander Zhang took the lead and fought hand-to-hand, advancing and retreating twice. Our rear support team joined in at the time, and the enemy's three companies were completely defeated, capturing dozens of rifles, more than 10,000 rounds of rifle ammunition, two light and heavy machine guns, and countless other spoils of war. Zhang, a loyal and clear-sighted killer of the enemy, was unfortunately shot in the head by an enemy machine gun at the 30th public office when he rushed into the enemy's position and died without being saved. The entire division of officers and soldiers mourned for him. Battalion Commander Zhang was from Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province, a graduate of the Huangpu Military Academy. It is said that his parents are still alive, and he left behind a widow and young children.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Under the Destruction of the Enemy Bandits</h3>
<p>Passersby on the Street Suffer All Kinds of Insults, Various Puppet Organizations Are Established, Women in the Suburbs Are All Brutally Violated</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: More than two months have passed since the enemy carried out a brutal bombing of Tianjin on July 29th and implemented military occupation. Not only has the security and order of Tianjin not been restored, but it has increasingly fallen into a state of anarchy. The following is a record of various situations:</p>
<p>Forcible Occupation of Transportation</p>
<p>Tianjin has now become a major rear military base. Land transportation tools such as the Beining Railway and the lower section of the Jinpu Railway, as well as highways from Tianjin to various places, have been occupied by the enemy for military use. Although there is currently one passenger train running daily between Pingjin and Pingyu, due to the congestion of military vehicles along the way, each delay averages more than ten hours. The Beining Railway has invisibly become the South Manchuria Railway. All locomotives, telephones, telegraphs, and station buildings have been occupied by the enemy of the South Manchuria Railway. Although the Beining Railway has nominally resumed office, the departure time of each passenger train and the deployment of vehicles must be subject to the command of the enemy of the South Manchuria Railway. It is said that in order to facilitate transportation, the enemy has decided to connect the Beining Railway with the puppet Fengshan Railway and change it to the puppet Pingfeng Railway. Maritime transportation was forcibly occupied by the enemy before the incident. Except for British merchant ships sailing irregularly, our country's ships have already sailed south due to the Japanese army's forcible requisition. Air navigation is even more monopolized by enemy aircraft. There is a large aircraft repair and hangar in Dongjuzi, where thirty enemy aircraft are currently parked, which fly daily to Jinpu, Pinghan, and other places for reconnaissance and bombing. The enemy has two major barracks in Tianjin, namely Haiguang Temple and Dongjuzi, which can station about 20,000 troops. Enemy soldiers arrive daily from outside the pass, and can store a large number of military supplies.</p>
<p>Searching Pedestrians</p>
<p>The most heartbreaking thing is that enemy soldiers insult people in every possible way when searching pedestrians on the street. In order to avoid danger, people buy enemy flags as talismans for passage. Two weeks ago, Japanese and Korean ruffians made a great fortune by manufacturing and selling enemy flags.</p>
<p>Using Puppets</p>
<p>After the enemy took control of Tianjin, they were eager to restore security in order to reduce their worries. Therefore, they used shameless traitors to organize the "Tianjin Local Security Maintenance Association," whose powers are equal to the municipal government, with five bureaus: General Affairs, Public Security, Finance, Engineering, and Health. On the surface, it is organized by Chinese, but in reality, all powers are commanded by the enemy. Each bureau of the puppet Maintenance Association has Japanese advisors. All major and minor events must be approved by the Japanese advisors before they can be handled. There are many traitors in Tianjin, and they all want to compete for official positions. Therefore, various puppet organizations have been established, such as the so-called Greater Asia Association, East Asia Association, Sino-Japanese Friendship Promotion Association, Oriental Association, North China Autonomous Association, and North China Youth Party.</p>
<p>Enslaving Education</p>
<p>In order to ingratiate itself with Japan, the puppet Maintenance Association established the so-called Textbook Revision Committee after the establishment of the puppet Social Affairs Bureau, collecting textbooks from primary and secondary schools and arbitrarily deleting and revising textbooks on national language, history, geography, society, and civics. Any national humiliation historical materials, unequal treaties, the "September 18th" Incident, Sun Yat-sen, the Three Principles of the People, the Party-State flag, and parts about imperialist aggression against China are completely deleted, considering them "detrimental to diplomatic relations," "promoting revolution," and "inciting youth." The puppet committee members of this committee, namely Niu Chuanshan, director of the puppet Social Affairs Bureau, Tao Ziquan, director of the puppet Education Bureau, and Lin Shaochang, are all complete traitors. In addition, there are Japanese advisors such as Daxi. The textbooks read before are all regarded as "reactionary." The Maintenance Association specially ordered all middle schools to adopt scriptures and Japanese starting this year. All schools have now complied. Japanese is taught by Japanese people, with one or two Japanese teachers in each school. The content of the textbooks is absurd and unbearable. For example, in geography class, the puppet organization "Manchukuo" is regarded as an independent country. In Japanese class, Japan is extremely glorified and exaggerated.</p>
<p>Framing Youth</p>
<p>The Japanese warlords recently ordered the puppet Social Affairs Bureau to also order all schools to implement "ideological detection." Any teachers, students, words, deeds, and thoughts with patriotic tendencies are designated as anti-Japanese and must be detected and reported by the school or arrested by the government. Therefore, most teachers, students, and young people have already left school and lived elsewhere.</p>
<p>Absurd Slogans</p>
<p>A week ago, the puppet Maintenance Association inspected the municipal library, popular library, reading room, and other public education institutions, destroying all books, newspapers, and magazines that the enemy considered "detrimental to diplomatic relations" and "inflammatory." All kinds of slogans, maxims, and Sun Yat-sen's will on the walls were washed away, and replaced with absurd slogans such as "Realize Chinese Autonomy," "Promote Sino-Japanese Friendship to Create a Happy Land in North China."</p>
<p>Disordered Order</p>
<p>The local order in Tianjin, except for the concessions, has not yet returned to its original state. The police are all unarmed. Therefore, Japanese soldiers, ruffians, and gangsters are extremely rampant. Good people cannot live in peace, and there is very little recovery of businesses. Residents are even more disturbed. Japanese soldiers and ruffians extort money, forcibly sell drugs, and even rape women and forcibly abduct young girls. In the villages near the urban area, many young women have been violated. Therefore, many people have recently fled to the concessions. Tianjin has almost become a living hell. (15th)</p>
<h3>Mechanized Weapons Are Not to Be Feared (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent</p>
<p>—The most obvious progress in aerial power is the anti-aircraft gun. Now, in relatively clear weather, it can shoot down aircraft flying below 12,000 feet with fifteen shots. The gun is equipped with an automatic firing mechanism that can hit a bomber in thirty seconds. It is also equipped with a sound detection mechanism that can detect enemy aircraft flying within 20 to 35 miles. Bombers have a maximum speed that allows them to arrive in five or six minutes. By tracking their movements and firing when they enter the range, the accuracy is very high. These are two major advancements in anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<p>—During the World War, the ratio of aircraft shot down by enemy aircraft to those shot down by anti-aircraft guns was five to one. However, in the current Spanish War, the results are reversed. That is, anti-aircraft guns shoot down five aircraft for every one shot down by another aircraft. As a result, it is much more difficult for enemy aircraft to bomb after reaching the front lines. Aircraft squadrons that previously had to remain in the country to defend against enemy aircraft can now fly out to engage in counter-attacks.</p>
<p>The next weapon that those who advocate mechanized warfare to quickly annihilate the enemy focus on is the tank. However, their hopes have not been realized in the Spanish War. None of the military leaders of Germany, Italy, or the Soviet Union are happy with the performance of tanks. The light tanks of both sides cannot guarantee their safety when encountering simple weapons like steep ditches, hand grenades during the journey, or jets of ignited gasoline. Heavy armor, while sufficient to defend against tank fire, sacrifices the agility of movement. From these two points of view, we can conclude that tanks will undoubtedly be used extensively as one of many mechanized weapons to assist infantry in attacks, but they cannot increase the initial gains of the attacking army.</p>
<p>Another issue is that the supplies needed by land or air mechanized units are particularly difficult to maintain during an offensive. The recent large-scale exercises by the British and French armies were not yet completed when the gasoline ran out. In a real war, the supply lines can be easily disrupted by the enemy. According to the ideal of quickly annihilating the enemy, such a mechanized offensive army, the trains carrying tanks and ammunition, can only carry fuel for one day. After it is used up, it must be replenished. However, how can an isolated army deep in enemy territory obtain supplies from the rear? This is a very difficult problem to solve, and it causes the rear supply officers of the invaders to scratch their heads without a solution.</p>
<p>As for gas, it also seems difficult to achieve the ideal results envisioned by Douhet. The idea of using aircraft to drop gas bombs to destroy large cities is purely a simple fabrication. A city like New York would require tens of thousands of attacks with mustard gas (the most powerful of the three gases used in World War I) to force residents to flee. Furthermore, the effectiveness of mustard gas can be neutralized with lime chloride, so it must be concentrated on the ground to be truly effective. In reality, mustard gas is a weapon that favors the defending army, as it can be used to block the advance of the attacking army by spreading it on the ground. As for newly invented and unknown gases, chemists all agree that there is no such thing at present.</p>
<p>New weapons that can guarantee the immediate annihilation of the enemy in a sudden attack by the aggressor have not yet appeared. The weapons that have been improved in recent years have not given the attacking or defending parties any significant advantage, and they have put the aggressor at risk of a protracted war. The failure of the Fascist forces in front of Madrid is ample proof of this. The machine gun is still the "king of the battlefield," and it is indeed a powerful weapon for the defending army.</p>
<p>The current world situation is leaning towards peace. Only countries ruled by dictators embrace aggression. Dictatorships will never dare to risk a protracted war if they can avoid it. This is very clear to democratic countries. Another aspect that democratic countries are concerned about is that the impact of the development of aerial power has forced large armies to disperse into smaller units for self-defense. The influence of machines like tanks, which are operated by a small number of people, is similar. Small units of soldiers must rely on themselves. Therefore, the chances of winning in modern warfare are in the hands of the people. Only the social organization, economic habits, and political methods of a democratic country can produce agile and self-disciplined soldiers. It is not easy to produce such soldiers under modern dictatorships, because the "harmony of people" in a democratic system is beyond the reach of a dictatorship.</p>
<h3>Kunshan Suffers Repeated Enemy Aircraft Bombing</h3>
<p>Attacked Twice in One Day, Many Houses Inside and Outside the City Destroyed</p>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence: Enemy aircraft have been attacking Kunshan for days, dropping bombs and causing civilians to be killed and injured. At 10:50 AM on the 16th, five more enemy aircraft circled several times over the urban area, dropping four bombs. The Tianlu Tea Food Store on South Main Street, the Tongchangyi South Goods Warehouse, and the Ding Yutong Peanut Shop on Xiaoma Road were all hit, destroying more than thirty houses and injuring several civilians. At 1:10 PM, six enemy aircraft dropped eleven bombs at the railway station.</p>
<p>In Bacheng Town, the eighth district of the county, at around 12:00 noon on the 19th, four enemy aircraft circled and reconnoitered over the town for several weeks, then strafed farmers in the fields with machine guns in Huangnitian Village, about a mile away from the town.</p>
<p>At 10:22 AM on the 21st, three enemy aircraft (including one large aircraft) circled over the area outside the East Gate, dropping more than twenty bombs. Part of the Huie Bureau's warehouse was bombed and destroyed, as well as the electric rice mill, the Wang family's residence, and more than a dozen thatched houses on the bank of the Kuntai Highway Bridge. Four residents from Jiangbei were injured, and two cows were killed. According to eyewitnesses, when the enemy aircraft were circling, a traitor was sending signals. The traitor has now been arrested and executed.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Sends Telegram to Encourage Anti-Enemy Association</h3>
<p>Donate Money and Efforts to Rescue the Wounded and Help Those in Need, Go North to Boost the Morale of the Troops and Promote National Spirit</p>
<p>Since its establishment three months ago, the Anti-Enemy Support Association of All Circles in this city has led various circles to establish various committees based on actual needs, and has handled rescue, relief, consolation, transportation, technology and other work separately. Recently, as the battle line in North China has become longer and the north is bitterly cold, we are deeply concerned and saddened by the loyal and brave soldiers who are fighting tirelessly for the country. Therefore, we have specially raised more than 200,000 yuan in consolation donations from various groups and organized a northern consolation delegation, which is scheduled to depart for the front in the near future. After the association reported the situation to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek by telegram, we received a reply telegram yesterday, which roughly stated that since the war of resistance, the association has led all circles to donate money and efforts, rescue the wounded and help those in need, and has made many contributions with outstanding achievements, which are deeply appreciated. The northern consolation is even more sufficient to promote national spirit and encourage military morale. It is hoped that we will continue to work hard and make more efforts to achieve great achievements, etc. After receiving the telegram, the association has distributed it to the various committees under its jurisdiction for reference and mutual encouragement.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Library Association Forms Wartime Service Team</h3>
<p>Formulate an Outline of the Wartime Work Plan for the National Library Community</p>
<p>The Municipal Library Association, in view of the gradual stabilization of various public and private libraries in this city, specially convened all executive and supervisory committee members and library directors yesterday (24th) for a discussion meeting in order to promote wartime work. Chairman Lin Side reported on the situation of various libraries in this city before and after the war of resistance, and the general idea of jointly organizing wartime work was approved by all members. A wartime service team was immediately organized, with Cui Zhuxi appointed as the general director, Lin Side as the deputy general director, and responsible personnel for six groups, and the following motions were discussed: ㊀ Formulate an outline of the wartime work plan for the national library community; ㊁ Investigate the general situation of libraries across the country destroyed by the enemy and publicize it to the world; ㊂ Send a letter to libraries across the country requesting them to organize war-related reading materials libraries, mobile libraries for wounded soldier hospitals and refugee camps, and wartime newspaper and reading areas; ㊃ Provide reference materials for various salvation groups; ㊄ Solicit donations, books and periodicals; ㊅ Unite with cultural salvation groups in this city to jointly promote wartime cultural education work; ㊆ Compile a catalog of wartime reading materials.</p>
<h3>The Yizhong Tobacco Company's Shanghai Factory Has No Set Date to Restart Production</h3>
<p>The British Yizhong Tobacco Company has four factories in Shanghai: the Pudong New Factory, the Third Factory on Taopeng Road, the Huashi Factory in Hongkou, and the Printing Factory on Huasheng Road, with a total of 13,000 male and female workers. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, all factories have been forced to suspend operations due to being located in the war zone. For more than two months, the company has been gradually returning stored wages and providing relief funds to maintain livelihoods. However, two-thirds of these workers have moved to the interior to take refuge. It was reported in the newspaper the other day that the factories would risk reopening and order all workers to wear yellow uniforms to identify themselves, etc. The workers have all come to Shanghai one after another. Now it is known that the news of the reopening is not true.</p>
<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Shanghai War Situation</h3>
<p>— Should</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai war situation has been exceptionally fierce. Before the Peking Conference, the enemy wants to wash away the shame of the disastrous defeat on the 12th, bolster the prestige of the "Imperial Army," and at any cost, continue the strategy of a central breakthrough. Judging from the current war situation, the enemy forces are making fierce attacks along a scissor-shaped route, with the goal of capturing my two military centers, Dachang and Nanxiang. However, our army's strong resistance and fierce counterattacks have repeatedly blunted the enemy's offensive. Moreover, the two salient positions of the enemy army are still under our army's encirclement on three sides, and of course, it is not easy to make further progress. Even if the enemy forces approach the destination of their attack, they will inevitably encounter even stronger resistance from us for a long period of time. How could our entire line be shaken by this?</p>
<p>At this moment when the main battle is unfolding, we believe that our military generals are certainly employing far-reaching and sophisticated strategies to enable the entire army to achieve the greatest victory with the least sacrifice. The fact that our army recovered dozens of villages in one night on the 21st further makes us realize the high strength of our army's combat effectiveness. Although our army temporarily abandoned some villages yesterday due to the enemy's fierce artillery bombardment, they will certainly be recovered sooner or later. In any case, the battle on this first line of defense will certainly last for many days. The enemy will definitely not be able to achieve their wish of gaining any "face" within this month.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Reaffirms His Desire to Pursue a Policy of Peace</h3>
<p>World Security and Human Civilization are Threatened; America is Willing to Exert Effort to Restore International Order</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt issued a proclamation today, ordering all public institutions across the country to fly flags on Armistice Day (November 11th of next month) to celebrate, and requesting that all citizens hold appropriate ceremonies in churches and schools at that time to "express the American people's gratitude for peace and their desire to continue maintaining friendly relations with all nations of the world." He also stated that international security, and even civilization itself, is now threatened by lawless and land-grabbing behavior. We should once again express our desire, which is: ① to pursue a policy of peace, ② to adopt all feasible methods to avoid war, ③ to work hard to restore trust and order between countries, and ④ to reiterate that the vast majority of people in the world cherish the desire for peace.

<h3>Soviet Union Closely Watches the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>My Representative Cables the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Request Instructions; There is a Rumor that Japan Requests a Postponement of the Conference</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Nine-Power Treaty Conference has invited a total of nineteen countries to participate. According to diplomatic circles, whether Japan participates or not is not enough to increase or decrease the effectiveness of the conference. What is important is whether the conference's power can be fully exerted, and whether fairness and justice will not be obscured by violence, which depends entirely on whether the conference's resolutions are strong. The Soviet Union, which is located in the Far East and is closely related to Far Eastern issues, is not a signatory country to the conference, but it is watching it very closely. Its representative to the League of Nations, Litvinov, has returned to Moscow. According to news from the Soviet Embassy, Litvinov will leave Moscow again in three or four days to go to Peking to monitor the future progress of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Diplomatic circles have heard that my representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Gu Weijun, etc., have sent cables to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions in recent days. It is said that the conference will take a break one or two days after it opens, and then resume the formal meeting on November 3rd. (24th, Special Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is scheduled to open on the 30th of this month in Brussels, Peking. Japanese newspapers advocate postponing the meeting so that the Japanese government can prepare with ease. US Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to the press, saying that he has not received any formal notification regarding this matter. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, The Times recently wrote an article commenting on it, saying that the goal of this conference is to mediate between China and Japan, and the United States has the best chance of success in conducting the mediation work. Although this responsibility is not easy to carry out, on the one hand, China's heroic resistance has exceeded general expectations, and on the other hand, China is also afraid that it will not be able to resist for so long without end. Therefore, the mediation proposal is not impossible. What is unknown is to what extent this factor can affect the mediation work. The country conducting the mediation can only seize the opportunity to make the most of it. As for the mediation responsibility, it is clearly more convenient for the United States to start. If necessary, that country can launch this matter, and Britain will certainly cooperate with it wholeheartedly. (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Norwegian Peace Association Condemns Japanese Atrocities</h3>
<p>Disregarding Treaties and Exposing Bestiality; Hopes that All Countries Will Adopt Effective Measures</p>
<p>⊙Oslo, Capital of Norway Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, the Norwegian branch of the World Peace Conference recently unanimously passed a resolution, which is being prepared for delivery to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The content severely condemns Japan's attitude towards China, stating that the Japanese army's invasion of Chinese territory not only contradicts the basic principles of international law, but also violates the obligation to protect China's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty. "The Japanese army's bombing of undefended cities and towns in China, and the adoption of various barbaric methods of warfare, have already created a cruel and terrifying spectacle." Since Norway is one of the signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty, it is hoped that at the upcoming Nine-Power Treaty Conference, when discussing the implementation of effective international measures to deal with Japan, the Norwegian government will support them.

<h3>The Issue of the Effectiveness of Air Defense Nets</h3>
<p>Differing Opinions in British Military Circles</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the question of whether it is effective to use metal air defense nets, towed by balloons into the sky, to defend against air raids, opinions in British military circles are very divided. Those who agree say that this kind of air defense net is very effective for dealing with enemy aircraft night raids, because enemy aircraft will inevitably fly at high altitudes to avoid touching the air defense net, so the bombs dropped will be difficult to hit. However, it is very difficult to use this air defense net during the day. Those who hold the opposite view say that new bombers have extremely high lift and can carry out attacks at an altitude of 25,000 feet. If you want to manufacture special air defense nets that can rise to the same height, it is impossible in terms of technology and finance. In addition, new aircraft can be equipped with equipment on the nose to cut off metal air defense nets, so it is not difficult to break through them. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Negotiations on the Spanish Issue are on the Verge of Collapse</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union is Opposed to the Italian-German Bloc; the Non-Intervention Committee is Scheduled to Reconvene Tomorrow; Italy Notifies Britain and France of the Number of Volunteers in Spain</p>
<p>[London] Italy's statement that it will no longer make concessions in the dispute over mediating the Spanish Civil War has rendered the latest non-involvement plan a pipe dream again. For months, countries have been negotiating diplomatically back and forth, but as a result, the Soviet Union and the Italian-German bloc are still irreconcilable. Even Britain and France oppose the "symbolic" withdrawal of volunteers from both sides of the civil war in equal numbers. Therefore, the meeting of the Non-Intervention Agreement Committee, which was originally scheduled to be postponed until Monday, has been postponed until Tuesday before it can be reconvened. Political circles familiar with the situation generally acknowledge that negotiations are on the verge of collapse. The meeting on Tuesday may only be able to pass a report, stating that it cannot decide on a plan to withdraw volunteers. Italy has declared that if the Non-Intervention Committee sends representatives to Spain to investigate the number of volunteers, Italy cannot be bound by it. Therefore, the only hope at present is that France can persuade the Soviet Union before Tuesday, and Britain can also persuade Italy to slightly change their attitudes. (24th, National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Air Force Exercises by the French Air Force Along the Mediterranean Coast of North Africa</h3>
<p>Four Hundred Personnel and Ninety-Six Aircraft Participate; Squadrons Take Off from France to Test Long-Distance Flight</p>
<p>[Paris] The French Air Force will hold unprecedented large-scale exercises in the near future along the French Algerian Sahara and Tunisian coasts of the Mediterranean, and the African coast of the Atlantic. The exercises will involve 96 military aircraft and approximately 400 aviation personnel. All aviation personnel will be flying the latest aircraft equipped with multiple engines and extremely high speeds, taking off from France for long-distance flights to compare the merits of their skills. Each team is responsible for a specific task, not only for military purposes, but also to use a large number of colonial aircraft to connect the headquarters with the colonies and provide sanitary equipment. The purpose of this group flight is to train aviation personnel, test whether aviation technology and materials are excellent, and determine whether long-distance flight is possible and whether the prepared engines are durable and usable. The first squadron is scheduled to fly to Tunisia on October 17, traversing the African continent to the French island of Madagascar. At the same time, an aircraft carrier will also sail to the port of Tunis, carrying twenty destroyers to patrol along the coast. By November 9, the African aircraft squadron will take off from France, while another small team will travel through Tunis, Egypt, and the Syrian capital to Vietnam. In addition, 30 bombers will fly through the Sahara Desert and Morocco to Tunis via other routes. In addition, there are other squadrons of aircraft practicing in various parts of Africa, and after the exercises, they will gather at the Port of Bizerte in Tunis. The total distance flown is approximately 25,000 kilometers. (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Friendly Nations Actively Assist in Relief Work</h3>
<p>International Red Cross Representative Collects Medicines; Skilled Surgeons Come to China to Serve</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Lieutenant Colonel Leteville, Special Representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross, recently arrived in China to inspect the work of the Chinese Red Cross. This work is now nearing completion. Yesterday afternoon, he told a representative of the Shanghai Times that he had prepared a detailed list of medicines needed by China and sent it to Geneva. In the near future, a large number of medicines will be transported to help China. He expects the International Committee to send this list to the relevant countries, so that each country has the opportunity to supply China with its specialty medicines. Hua also said that China is currently in urgent need of surgeons to take on the affairs of rear hospitals. This matter is known abroad, so there will be many skilled surgeons from all over the world coming to China to serve. Hua then described the overall situation of the Chinese Red Cross, saying that the Chinese Red Cross naturally has extremely important work to do now. He believes that the Red Cross has indeed shown some signs of progress, especially because a 5,000-bed wounded soldier hospital has been established in Nanjing. One of the most serious problems is the transportation of wounded soldiers from the front line to the rear. Even civilian ships are now used to transport wounded soldiers in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, which of course arrives very slowly. However, the railway is currently blocked from time to time, so it cannot be faster to transport them by train. Hua has inspected many places since arriving in Shanghai several weeks ago. Before returning to Geneva to make a final report, he will go to Nanjing once. Hua is very optimistic about the refugee relief affairs in Shanghai, saying that Shanghai is a rich city after all, and various forces are sufficient.</p>
<h3>"Neutral Observer" Reproaches Enemy Aircraft for Flying Over the Concessions</h3>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Carry Bombs, Endangering Security</p>
<p>The Chinese-language newspaper *Zi Lin Bao* yesterday published a letter from a signatory "Neutral Observer," arguing that some express dissatisfaction that Chinese bombers fly over the Public Concession at night, but these individuals should not forget that Japanese aircraft dropped bombs in the Mackenzie Road and Xinzha Road area within the past ten days, which damaged properties and caused multiple casualties. Furthermore, Japanese aircraft fly over or near the Concession district everyday, and they provoke anti-aircraft fire from Chinese troops, which entails the danger of being hit and the possibility that stray bombs fall into the Concession district or that they crash into it. The Japanese authorities should not deny this claim, because dozens of impartial witnesses can swear that Japanese aircraft have flown over the Garden Bridge, Park, Museum Road, Riverfront Apartments, and other locations. Moreover, these aircraft carry bombs, as evidenced by the fact that shortly after they fly over these areas, they will drop bombs in Zhabei. Japanese authorities can in no way shirk their responsibility in these actions, because the Japanese aircraft can fly from the Northeast to Zhabei without flying over the central area of the Concession or increasing the possibility that Chinese anti-aircraft artillery will hit them, which means that the anti-aircraft guns will not fire towards the central area. All military experts should acknowledge this.</p>
<h3>Legislator Wen Yuanning's Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>Japan is Destroying World Treaties, Not Only Related to China</p>
<p>Legislator of the Legislative Yuan and editor of "T'ien Hsia Monthly" Wen Yuanning, gave a speech over the RCA radio station to the American people yesterday. The theme was the Nine-Power Treaty. The contents were rich and the arguments were penetrating. The general ideas were as follows: First, the world treaties and international agreements can be said to have been completely destroyed by Japan today. If this kind of destruction of the covenant and aggression against other countries cannot be stopped in the Far East, then it must not be stopped in Europe, America, and the world. The issue is not just about China, but international agreements themselves. For the upcoming Nine-Power Treaty Conference, China welcomes it. The only request of China is for the implementation of justice and treaty obligations. One of the most important articles of the Nine-Power Treaty, such as respecting China's sovereignty, territory, and administrative integrity and independence, must be respected and fulfilled by Japan. We do not believe that, as rumored, the Nine-Power Treaty will be beneficial to Japan, and that it will increase Japan's barbarism and aggression. From our point of view, 1) before the territorial status quo after the July 7th Incident is restored, 2) China will never accept any mediation until all the points raised by China to the League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty countries to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute after the September 18th Incident have not been reached.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Present and Future of the Boycott of Japanese Goods Movement</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the all-out resistance war, the so-called "boycott of Japanese goods" and "economic severance with Japan" initially did not seem to be placed within the scope of "all-out resistance." Therefore, despite the fierce battles in North China in July, a large number of Japanese goods were still imported into Shanghai and other ports in South China. Even after the "August 13th" Shanghai battle began, the import of Japanese goods into Shanghai that month was still very high. It wasn't until last month that various sectors, in order to expand the scope of the "all-out resistance war," vigorously advocated severing economic ties with the enemy, and especially "boycotting Japanese goods." What has been the effect of the boycott of Japanese goods in the past month or two? Some recently published customs statistics can be used to examine this.</p>
<p>According to the report of the Jianghai Customs, the import of Japanese goods into Shanghai in September was indeed much less than before in terms of figures, totaling only more than 20,000 gold units, equivalent to more than 45,000 national currency dollars. Compared with before the war, it has plummeted, and even compared with the import of Japanese goods of 700,000 gold units last month, it has also fallen sharply. On the surface, this seems to indicate that some effects of the boycott have been achieved. However, since the outbreak of the August 13th battle, Japan soon blockaded the Chinese coast, and most foreign ships did not dare to come to Shanghai to take risks, while most of the Japanese ships were requisitioned for the enemy's military transportation, which naturally greatly reduced the import of Japanese goods. This is not the result of China's boycott, but a natural trend during wartime. Therefore, not only the import of Japanese goods has decreased, but also the import of goods from other countries has decreased.</p>
<p>Moreover, in reality, during the Shanghai battle in September, when the fighting was so prolonged and so fierce, there were still officially declared Japanese goods worth 40,000 to 50,000 dollars, which is also a matter that cannot be ignored. An investigation reveals that all kinds of imported Japanese goods were present, and the more important ones included Japanese sugar, with 490 metric tons, worth 3,000 gold units; rayon fabrics, worth more than 1,000 gold units; hardware, machinery, vehicles, etc., worth more than 2,000 gold units in total; miscellaneous metals, worth more than 2,600 gold units; chemical medicines, more than 1,800 gold units; paper and the like, about 1,000 gold units; leather, worth more than 1,900 gold units; and groceries, more than 4,000 gold units. Looking at this account, although the categories are not large, in the midst of bloody warfare and under the enthusiastic boycott of Japanese goods movement, there is still such a sum of enemy goods being imported. Isn't this our shame! Moreover, this figure is officially declared through our country's customs; and there are still those Japanese merchant ships arbitrarily entering and leaving the Shanghai East war zone, secretly playing the game of temporary customs duties. How much Japanese goods are imported, I am afraid only the enemy knows. Recently, reports state that important Japanese stores and banks in Shanghai are doing their best to collude with traitors in order to dump their old and newly imported goods. With such a bottomless loophole in the war zone, how can the import of Japanese goods be truly reduced?</p>
<p>Therefore, even if we can boycott the officially declared import of Japanese goods to zero, if we cannot boycott the import of goods from enemy-occupied areas, the effect will be very limited. We must know that Japanese goods are now transported to China through four major destinations: in addition to mainland China, there are also the three northeastern provinces, the Dalian leased territory, and Hong Kong. The amount of Japanese goods transported to the Northeast is now about the same as that transported to mainland China. Before the lost territories in the Northeast are recovered, we have no way to boycott Japanese goods transported here. Secondly, the amount of Japanese goods transported to Dalian is usually more than that transported to mainland China, which is the source of most of the smuggled goods in North China. Under the circumstances that North China has fallen into a war zone, it is of course not easy to boycott them. As for Hong Kong, it was originally a major base for Japanese goods to change their appearance and be smuggled into the country, but the number has not been very large recently. However, as far as mainland China is concerned, since Tianjin and Beijing have been occupied by the enemy, Japanese goods can be officially imported from Tianjin, and we have no way to interfere with them at present. If they still resort to smuggling, then we have to let them do as they please. Therefore, if we want to boycott Japanese goods, under the current circumstances, we must not only ensure that the customs under the government's control achieve zero officially declared imports of Japanese goods, but also step up the recovery of lost territories and eradicate the sources from which enemy goods can be freely imported.</p>
<p>In short, we should not overestimate the effect of the boycott of Japanese goods, nor should we underestimate it. This should also be carried out in coordination with military actions. If we want to strengthen the power of armed resistance, we can only work hard to carry out the boycott of Japanese goods movement; and if we want the complete success of the boycott of Japanese goods movement, it must be after the completion of armed resistance. We must recognize the importance of their interrelationship, and we must not relax our efforts any further.</p>
<h3>Chinese Sailors on Dutch Ships Refuse to Transport Munitions to Japan</h3>
<p>Preferring Imprisonment to Going to Enemy Ports, Fearing Conspiracy by the Enemy</p>
<p>The enemy's invasion of our country has ignited an all-out war of resistance, which is the only way for our nation to survive. Since the outbreak of the war, all nationals have been united against the enemy. Chinese sailors working on foreign merchant ships overseas are even more enthusiastic about protecting their motherland. In addition to donating part of their salary every month, they have refused to work and resigned on foreign ships that carry weapons of murder to enemy countries, which helps to increase the enemy's aggression. In order to express their sincerity in loving the country, there are seventy-nine Chinese sailors on a certain Dutch shipping company's ××× ship sailing on the Java, Shanghai, and Japan line. Because the ship loaded a large quantity of military supplies such as cotton and wire mesh for military use in Surabaya to Japan, all the Chinese sailors on the ship refused to work because they were unwilling to help the enemy invade their motherland. They were immediately detained by the local police and imprisoned. Among them, sixty-five people were forced to resume work by the military police after being imprisoned, but fourteen people resolutely refused to leave the prison and were willing to stay in prison forever. The sixty-five people who were forced to resume work declared to the company that they would never go to Japan with the ship, because they feared being harmed by the enemy's conspiracy. (Last month, when a certain ship of the company sailed to Japan, the Sino-Japanese War had already begun. Many Chinese sailors on the ship were forcibly accused by the Japanese of having an epidemic and were given an injection. Within one or two days, everyone became insane.) Therefore, they would rather be in Surabaya and suffer the taste of iron windows than go to Japan. After this incident occurred, more than one hundred Chinese sailors on two other ships also unanimously expressed to the company: 1) They are unwilling to help transport military supplies to Japan; 2) They are unwilling to go to Japan with the ship again. The company felt very difficult about this matter, so it first earnestly entrusted our consul in Surabaya to come forward to mediate. In the end, because it involved the life danger of each sailor, no one could bear this important responsibility, and the result was no solution. Now each sailor expressed that they would rather be punished for violating the contract and would never go to the enemy's ports again. I don't know how this matter will be resolved.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants in Shanghai Face Difficulties</h3>
<p>Request to Return Home Denied, Lack of Food and Clothing in Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Japanese merchants in Shanghai have requested to return to their country one after another because of the difficulty of living and the inability to maintain their livelihood. Unexpectedly, the Japanese authorities did not allow it. Since they cannot return home and have family burdens, the problem of food and clothing in Shanghai has become a major problem. Therefore, the Japanese Residents Group organized a Japanese Merchant Family Relief Association, with the group leader Gan Nong as the chairman and Fu Zi as the vice chairman, to provide food and clothing expenses for the families of these Japanese merchants. As for the association's address, it is located in the Japanese Shanghai Bank on Haining Road and Zha Pu Road in Hongkou.</p>
<h3>How Western Countries Directly Threatened Can Suppress the Violent Sun</h3>
<p>Hypothetical Prediction of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference The Effect of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty</p>
<p>The editorial of the English-language "Great American Evening Post" in this city is entitled "Suppressing Japan," which roughly states, "An article in the 'New York National Weekly' with the title 'Can Japan Be Restrained?' describes the situation in which Japan's aggression has been gradually approaching since the Manchurian Incident in 1931. It also states that 'Today we have eaten the consequences of the delaying and cowardly measures taken before.'" "The situation we are encountering now is more serious than in 1931." Under such circumstances, it is difficult for the U.S. government to suggest "a kind of positive policy." Implementing neutrality is extremely beneficial to Japan and no different from cooperating with Japan to trample on China, as we have said before. Withdrawing American interests in China is tantamount to ceding interests in China to Japan. As for taking collective action to suppress Japan, how to implement it? We hope that the United Kingdom, France, and the United States will take what kind of collective measures in the current dispute? Indeed, Japan's invasion of Chinese territory and blockade of the Chinese coast is a direct threat to the economic interests of the Western powers in China. This is an undeniable fact. The authority of the Nine-Power Treaty is still as strong as when it was signed. There are various reasons to invoke the clauses of the Nine-Power Treaty to convene a conference of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to consider a collective policy in the Pacific. The United States is obviously the only country to initiate it. However, what can the Nine-Power Treaty Conference do? We can assume that any country does not want to go to war with Japan because of protecting the integrity of Chinese territory or the economic interests of imperialism, nor will it impose economic sanctions or boycott Japan. The boycott movement will be carried out by individuals, groups, and labor groups. However, when the powers hold consultations, they must agree to insist on treaty rights and trade with China without declaring war, even if Japan is lucky enough to win. This kind of resolution can be implemented collectively without the risk of triggering an international war. Not only that, but all countries can take further actions. If all countries want to ensure China's stability, they have various reasons to help Nanjing resist Japan. As for the implementation of sanctions, there may be opponents due to the interests of various countries. However, agreeing to collective economic assistance to China will not cause opposition from any party, and its effect is the same as refusing to help Japan. The loan obtained by Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, is a similar method. This kind of assistance has the benefit of affecting Japan without causing the harm of opposition due to sanctions. Furthermore, inviting the Soviet Union to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is also beneficial. The Soviet Union recently signed a non-aggression treaty with China. At the same time, it is a beneficial action. If all countries can take the same action at this time, and add concrete economic assistance, then Japan's illegal acts in Asia can be curbed without resorting to war."</p>
<h3>People from All Walks of Life Enthusiastically Comfort Soldiers and Express Gratitude</h3>
<p>Hoping to Save Resources, Donate Needed Items</p>
<p>Since the war of resistance, various support groups have been collecting various items to comfort the soldiers fighting against Japan, most of which are food. However, as time passes and the road becomes longer, they often become moldy. The rear wastes money, while the soldiers fighting on our front lines find it difficult to obtain real benefits. At this time of long-term resistance war, material resources are difficult, and such waste is very regrettable. According to the generals on the front lines, they are very grateful, but they hope that all sectors can try their best to select items that are needed on the front lines and are not easily damaged, such as cotton clothes, towels, socks, and fist covers, etc., so as to be practical and avoid waste.</p>
<h3>German Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>To Negotiate the Relocation of German Merchants' Property in the War Zone</p>

Therefore, they were invited to Shanghai to preside over the matter. He will also negotiate with all parties on the relocation and reorganization of Tongji Medical College.</p>
<h3>The North China Daily News Records the Bombing of Xin Zha Road by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>Japanese Spokesman Makes Specious Arguments, Foreign Reporters Find It Hard to Believe</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that the "North China Daily News" in this city said that a bomb dropped by a Japanese aircraft on Xin Zha Road on the afternoon of the 22nd. As of the afternoon of the 23rd, a total of six people had died from their injuries, and forty-seven people were slightly injured. All those who died from their injuries were Chinese. Among the injured were two Indian police officers. In addition, there was an American sailor who saw a Chinese woman whose clothes caught fire and tried to put out the fire with his hands, resulting in burns to both hands, which were quite serious. The American sailor was the first to rush to the scene after the bomb fell and did his best to rescue the victims, but he was eventually sent to the hospital for treatment due to injuries to both hands. Furthermore, when the Japanese Navy spokesperson met with foreign reporters on the morning of the 23rd, he explicitly denied that the bomb on Xin Zha Road was dropped by a Japanese aircraft, which is the strangest thing. The fragments of the bomb have been picked up at the explosion site on Xin Zha Road, Mei Bai Ke Road, and within several yards west of it. They are in the custody of the American sailor officers and the Shanghai Municipal Council police department. It is said that the bomb is a small iron can type with a thin frame that has been melted by high heat. According to an American sailor chemical technician, the bomb is a kind of white phosphorus bomb and was dropped at 4:15 p.m. Seven American sailors witnessed three Japanese bombers turning right over the Suzhou River over the area. When the aircraft turned sharply, the outermost Japanese aircraft dropped the incendiary bomb, while the other three aircraft did not drop bombs. After the incident, American Fleet Commander Baomeng immediately lodged a formal protest with the First Fleet Commander. Zhang Gu Yong sent the Deputy Commander of the Third Japanese Fleet to the American Command on the morning of the 23rd to express his deep regret. In addition, when the Japanese Navy spokesperson met with foreign reporters on the afternoon of the 23rd, he claimed that the bomb on Xin Zha Road was caused by four Japanese aircraft. When flying over the Suzhou River, the oil storage device of the last aircraft suddenly fell off. At that time, the wind blew toward the concession, so the oil storage device fell at the intersection of Mei Bai Ke Road and Xin Zha Road. When asked how big the oil storage device was, the spokesperson replied that the oil storage device could hold two or three gallons of gasoline. After a little thought, he added that the device was used for emergency purposes. When asked whether the oil storage device was nailed to the plane with screws, he replied that he could not answer detailed information about the technical aspects. Then, a news reporter stood up and claimed that, according to neutral observers, the smell of phosphorous could be smelled when the bomb fell, and there was white powder on the road. The spokesperson replied that he did not know about it. Another news reporter questioned that, according to the doctor who examined the injured people at the time, the scars were caused by something very similar to phosphorous rather than gasoline. The spokesperson confidently claimed, "How do you know that the doctor did not come to this conclusion after learning about the situation in advance?" He also said that Japanese aircraft have never used incendiary bombs since the beginning of the Shanghai war.</p>

<h3>Marine Products and Southern Goods Industry Prevent Smuggling Work</h3>
<p>Appreciate Soliciting Informants Swearing to Express Determination</p>
<p>The Marine Products and Grocery Industry Association of this city convened its 13th plenary meeting of managers yesterday, attended by more than 40 people including Shao Baoxing, Zhou Zhuangui, Ye Bingzhang, and Hua Nanshan. The chairman was Wei Weian, and the recorder was Xu Xizhen. The key cases decided were as follows: 1) Regarding the newspaper report that a large-scale smuggling organization was issuing taxes in this city, saying that members of the industry participated, it was found to be inaccurate after investigation, but in order to strictly prevent smuggling and prevent problems before they occur, a reward of 300 yuan should be offered and an announcement should be made to solicit informants; 2) Hold an oath that will never sell smuggled goods, and in the August 13th article, not to have any economic dealings with enemy countries, or to buy enemy goods that are known to be disguised and of unknown origin; 3) Slightly omitted.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She said that the enemy goods in this city are secretly active, and it is heard that the southern goods industry has been the most affected. Recently, the industry association received a report that a treacherous merchant, Zhu, impersonated Gong Jingyan, the former chairman of the association, to sell smuggled goods to his colleagues, which is extremely abnormal and disgusting. The industry has been carefully investigated by the association and Mi. If this matter is found, you can immediately send it to the nearby police station for prosecution for the crime of impersonation. At the same time, report the details to the association or the chamber of commerce for investigation.</p>
<h3>Financial Stability Rediscount Reduced</h3>
<p>According to the Proportion of Total Loans Outstanding Balance of 15 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The rediscount committee jointly organized by the Central China Communications and Farmers' Four Banks is a financial institution that directly regulates financial activity in the market and handles present and mortgage loans. Since the beginning of the Shanghai war, the total amount of loans applied for from all parties has been 25 million yuan. However, recently, as the financial situation has become more stable, the business of various banks has also seen a turning point, and social needs are not as urgent as before. The market's chips are sufficient for circulation. Therefore, the amount of loans from the committee has now stalled. According to the proportion of the total amount of loans since its establishment, the current outstanding balance is about 15 million yuan, of which discount loans account for less than 10%, and mortgage loans are estimated to be more than 90%. New loans have gradually decreased, so interest rates have not fluctuated. The rediscount rate is still 8% per week, and the loan rate is still 3% per day per thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Actively Encouraging Donations for National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Ningbo Residents in Shanghai</p>

<p>Assistance from Chinese and Foreign Individuals in Shanghai and Hong Kong: Active Preparations to Be Realized Soon</p>

<p>According to news from the cotton fabric industry, this year's autumn harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is abundant, and the rural economy is very active. Therefore, sales of cotton textiles in the interior are particularly strong. This month, merchants from Ningbo, Shaoxing, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Suzhou, Songjiang, Zhenjiang, and northern Anhui in Zhejiang province have flocked to Shanghai to purchase goods. Large quantities of cotton textiles are shipped daily by water and land to the interior. Due to the war, shipments from cotton fabric merchants in this city have decreased, resulting in a situation where demand far exceeds supply.</p>

<h3>One Hundred Aspects of Japan in Wartime (Continued 2)</h3>
<p>⑥ The Evils of Japan's Conscription System</p>
<p>Japan has always prided itself on its "conscription system," in which the entire country is a soldier. However, its drawbacks are also numerous. Japanese men who reach the age of twenty-one must undergo conscription examinations. If they pass the examination, they must enlist in the army for one or two years. After the term expires, each person returns to their original profession. Those who have received higher education have just graduated and have many jobs but cannot take them because they must first serve in the military and must serve as volunteer soldiers who pay their own money. Because they have lost the opportunity to take a job, there are many people who have been unemployed for several years after coming out of the camp. As a result, many people who are in financial difficulties or really do not want to be soldiers damage their own bodies several months before the conscription examination, making themselves look yellow and emaciated, in order to fail the examination. However, a great man with a large body will naturally get "Grade A qualified" no matter how much he damages his body. The bad habits of smoking, drinking, and licentiousness are acquired, but military service is still unavoidable. I don’t know how many of these tragicomedies there are.</p>
<p>Once the country goes to war with foreign countries, all the able-bodied men who have served in the army must leave everything behind and go to the front line with a rifle in their hands. Some people do not have time to bury their deceased relatives, some do not have time to enter the bridal chamber after getting married, and some are so poor that they rely entirely on his labor to support their families. Before leaving, they sell their daughters or sisters to brothels as prostitutes, and some only have an old father or mother. Because no one takes care of them, many old parents commit suicide. How tragic these things are, but when they are reported in newspapers, they all become "beautiful stories after the war" because the people who are conscripted to fight are all production components or powerful people who work in society. When they go to serve in the army, no one does the work in society, at least there is a feeling of lack. One elementary school had eight teachers, and all of them were conscripted at the same time. Just imagine what this elementary school will look like. Countless other factory and shop employees have been conscripted. As a result, factories and shops feel a shortage of personnel and have to hug Buddha's feet temporarily, pulling some unfamiliar women and students to serve in military factories, which is a very good example.</p>
<p>When a soldier dies in battle, a family often loses its support and wanders the streets. Japan has added many orphans and widows out of thin air. These are all gifts from the Japanese military's militarism. Some widows, because they lost their support and had no way to go, committed suicide by jumping into the sea. Mei Zida Wei, the wife of Sato Shukei, who was widely publicized in the newspapers a few days ago, is an example.</p>
<p>Japan's conscription extends to all levels of society, and there are many funny materials that become the talk of the streets. For example, the death of a director from the Japanese drama and film industry on the front line became a propaganda event for a while. The most famous one was Yuta Kyosuke (real name Banta Goro), a strongman in the new drama world who had performed "All Quiet on the Western Front" at the Tsukiji Small Theater, who died on the Shanghai front line. His wife, Akiko Tamura, is a famous Japanese woman and expressed her feelings with tears upon hearing the news of her husband's death, "I really don't want him to die. Compared to dying in war, he has a more important cultural mission." Her curse on the war is already implied.</p>
<p>Many people in the film industry have joined the army. Currently on the Shanghai front are Shochiku Film Company director Ozu Yasujiro and P.C.S. director Yamanaka Sadao.</p>
<p>⑦ The Military's Morale-Boosting Strategy</p>
<p>Because Japan's dispatch of troops this time is unjustified, the general Japanese people are not interested in this matter. Their questions to each other are, 'Why does Japan want to fight China? Isn't it enough to have Manchuria?' 'If it causes public anger in the world and Japan becomes Germany during the European War, how will Japan be able to cope?' Coupled with the heavy taxation of the masses, the burden on the people has increased, and prices have soared. The people's lives are threatened, and military service is forced. The people are angry but dare not speak out. As a result, everyone is not enthusiastic about this war at all. No matter how passive the people are, how can Japan fight on the front lines? As a result, the military mobilized the media. All newspapers and magazines published war-drumming and war-promoting articles, reporting false news of 'the great victory of the Japanese army.' On the one hand, they launched a national defense donation movement. The Patriotic Women's Association, composed of noble ladies from the upper class, used psychologically simple female students to solicit donations on the streets. Each newspaper also launched donations for military aircraft donation funds, wounded soldier condolence funds, etc. From the surface, Japan is painted in a uniform military color, but this is really the Japanese saying 'empty energy'. In order to boost people's morale, the military pulled Konoe to the streets to give speeches. At the National Spiritual Mobilization held at Hibiya Hall, Konoe personally attended and gave a speech. After the parliament closed, he broadcast the content of his speech in the parliament to the whole country via radio. Each minister also went to various important cities to give speeches to give the Japanese people a strong heart agent.</p>
<p>The military also takes advantage of human vanity, encouraging grand farewells to 'soldiers going to war'. For example, if Mr. Fujita is a member of a bank, once he is conscripted, the colleagues of the bank, the alumni of the school he attended before, the neighbors of the same village and street, relatives and friends must hold a grand banquet for this 'Fujita going to war'. First, they drink and sing wildly, then prepare many cars and trucks, and relatives, friends, and colleagues sit in the cars. Each person holds a small flag in his hand and parades and demonstrates on the streets at lightning speed. Along the way, they sing military songs and shout slogans wildly. This Fujita wears a white cloth strip slung over his body with the words 'Fujita is going to war' written in red. All around him are demobilized soldiers in yellow khaki military uniforms, carrying large baskets on their shoulders with the words 'Farewell to Mr. Fujita for going to war' written on them. There are also several small flags with 'Pray for long-lasting military fortune' painted on them. If this parade and demonstration car is in Tokyo, it will definitely go to the Imperial Palace outside the Double Bridge to worship the Imperial Palace, worship the Emperor remotely, and go to the Meiji Shrine or Yasukuni Shrine to worship and pray for long-lasting military fortune. The drunken well-wishers are doing it with great enthusiasm, but the person being sent off is no different from being sent to the cemetery, and his family is crying with a mourning face like they are sending off a funeral. However, they cannot cry out loud. This is the honor of the samurai.</p>
<p>In the days before departure, there are thousands of such parade cars in the location of the barracks, and the streets are filled with sad shouts. Many soldiers come out of the countryside, and the barracks set up many 'meeting places' in nearby elementary schools or other public places to allow families to meet with the 'soldiers going to war'. There are old mothers pulling their sons, there are newlyweds who have only been married for a few days saying goodbye to their husbands with tears, and there are also women who are reluctant to part with their children and husbands. In order to fulfill their desire for conquest, the warlords drive these many unwilling young men to the front line to die. The Japanese army should be the greatest enemy of the Japanese people before becoming the enemy of China.</p>

<h3>The Enemy Still Attempts to Advance Westward; Fierce Battles Unfold at Chenjiaxiang and Yu Gong Temple</h3>
<p>Our New Positions Have Solid Fortifications, Making It Difficult for the Enemy to Succeed; Enemy Troops Attempt to Cross the Zoumatang River at Xiaochiyuan, But Are Annihilated by Our Forces</p>
<p>Regarding the battle on the south bank of the Yunzaobang River, after our troops automatically shifted from the Xiaochiyuan and Huguo Zhai line on the west side of the Shanghai-Dachang Highway to the south bank of the Zoumatang River and the Nanchen Zhai line, the enemy troops have continued to send their heavy troops to attack repeatedly. However, our elite troops are densely deployed in that area and are heavily fortified, and they are also connected to Dachang by transportation routes. Therefore, the enemy has repeatedly suffered heavy casualties. Knowing that attacking is futile, the enemy again resorted to the old trick of secretly crossing the Yunzaobang River last night in an attempt to attack the south bank of the Zoumatang River. However, the result was that all of them were annihilated by our army. The enemy troops in the Chenjiahang and Mengjiazai area attacked our new strongholds in Chenjiaxiang yesterday evening, hoping to directly attack the Nanxiang road, attacking our Yugongmiao position from Tanjiatou, hoping to cut off the highway between Dachang and Nanxiang, in order to achieve the hope of oppressing Dachang. However, our army has been prepared for a long time in places such as Chenjiaxiang, Jinjiasi, and Zhangjiazai, and has extremely close contact with Yugongmiao, Nanchenzhai, Taocuntang, and Fengjiaxiang. The positions are extremely solid, so the enemy's attack is doomed to failure. It is said that both sides launched fierce battles in the Chenjiaxiang, Jinjiasi, and Yugongmiao areas. Currently, the enemy troops are still entrenched in the Mengjiazai and Tanjiatou Xiaochiyuan area, seemingly reorganizing the remnants, hoping to try again. However, our large army is gathered and waiting with danger. There will be new developments in the near future, and the enemy's dream of attempting Dachang and Nanxiang will also be shattered as a result. Miaohang, Guangfu, and Luodian are all in our hands, and the front line has not moved. There have been no intense battles in recent days. Our army has an absolute advantage in Jiangwan. The area west of the Universal Sports Club is within our army's cordon. The enemy is entrenched east of the Universal Sports Club, but it has lost its combat capability.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Viciously Attacks Zoumatang, Repeated Charges Repelled</h3>
<p>The enemy at Gejia Pailou also repeatedly advanced, fiercely battling until midnight before being repelled by our forces</p>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent at Dazhang reported at 1:30 PM on the 25th: Due to Ma Juzhai being breached by the enemy, our forces north of Dazhang retreated to the northern bank of Zouniaotang, consolidating their position. Starting at 9:00 PM last night, the enemy launched another fierce assault on the front of Dazhang, attempting to break through in one fell swoop. Although their attack was extremely fierce, our troops were also loyal, brave, and tenacious in battle. Multiple enemy charges were repelled by our forces. By midnight, the enemy dared not come again. Both sides suffered heavy casualties in this battle, but our position has been stabilized. In addition, enemy troops from the Gejia Pailou area pursued, attempting to execute a central breakthrough about two kilometers within Dazhang. They were infiltrated by enemy troops yesterday at dusk, leading to a fierce battle after our interception. By midnight, the enemy was continuously reinforcing their forces. Taking advantage of the enemy's unstable formation, we launched a fierce counterattack, eventually driving the enemy back. After dawn, the battle subsided.</p>
<h3>Street Fighting in Zhabei Kills Over a Hundred Enemy Soldiers</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent in Zhabei reported at 2:10 PM on the 25th: Starting at 8:00 PM last night, the enemy used small units to continuously harass our positions at Dongbaoxing Road, Guangdong Street, and Qiujiang Road. Our troops defended key roads and alleyways, responding steadily. Gunfire was intermittent, sometimes intense, sometimes relaxed. Around 3:00 AM this morning, the enemy gradually increased their forces to four or five hundred men, attempting to launch a fierce assault on our positions. Our troops also jumped out of the trenches and counterattacked the enemy, initiating fierce street fighting. The two sides charged back and forth, engaging in hand-to-hand combat several times. The enemy began to retreat at dawn. In this battle, the enemy suffered over a hundred casualties.</p>
<h3>Night Attack by Our Forces in the Jiangwan Area</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent in Jiangwan reported at 12:10 PM on the 25th: After inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy in last night's hand-to-hand combat on Shuidaian Road, the enemy remained hidden and did not emerge, resulting in a very quiet second half of the night. Around 2:00 AM this morning, our forces outside Fangjia Muqiao, Tanjiazhai, Chizhi University, and other areas launched a night attack, advancing towards enemy positions at the Japanese Cemetery, the 63rd Flower Garden, and the Patriotic Girls' School. Our troops were exceptionally agile, frequently exploiting the enemy's unpreparedness to inflict significant pressure, causing the enemy to be exhausted in defense and having no opportunity to attack. After dawn, believing that their objectives had been achieved, our forces returned to their original positions.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation on the Liuhang-Luodian Front</h3>
<p>Our Air Force Achieves Successive Victories</p>
<p>Before setting off for the front lines the night before, this reporter visited the fighting soldiers on the Liuhang and Luodian lines. I returned to Shanghai at 2:30 AM this morning. The details are described as follows: (1) Within the approximately forty-li defense line along the river on the Liuhang line, since the start of the war, the enemy forces, due to the failure of their central breakthrough, unexpectedly revisited the old trick of the January 28th Incident. They secretly gathered thirty to forty warships to bombard us, and used over a hundred small steamboats to land ashore four times in succession. However, after our troops bravely charged and fought, the enemy's foothold was unstable. Before they could catch their breath, they were successively driven back, falling into the water and dying. Recently, the enemy has dared not directly face this line again. It is generally considered relatively calm, but the towns of Liuhang and Taicang have been destroyed by artillery fire, the situation is tragic, and they have become ruins. In addition, the night before, our entire left-wing army launched a counterattack. The defense line close to Luodian on that line contacted various armies and advanced ten li towards the enemy army, regaining many important locations. (2) In the Luodian area, since the nights of the 22nd and 23rd, after several attacks by our forces, the enemy suffered repeated casualties and became greatly panicked. Yesterday, near Laodan House, enemy reinforcements were discovered. Near Wujia House, around 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon, four enemy tanks were also discovered, with an intention to attack us. However, we were well prepared and will give them a painful blow. Furthermore, the enemy artillery has been fiercely bombarding our positions around Tangwan and Cao Wu Temple for days, especially yesterday. Dozens to a hundred shells landed per hour, but the firing was not very accurate, and the damage to our positions was minimal. Last night and the night before, our planes repeatedly flew over enemy positions and bombed them, achieving remarkable effects and killing many enemies, further demoralizing them. In addition, new types of enemy aircraft have recently appeared over the Luodian and Liuhang areas. (3) When this reporter returned, I saw that the Nanxiang and Dazhang areas were looking north tens of li away, and saw that the fire was shining brightly and the sound of artillery was like thunder, indicating that the fighting on the front lines was extremely fierce. Enemy planes were also constantly launching flares high up to conduct reconnaissance, but our army's nighttime movements were not affected in the slightest. The day before yesterday at noon, one enemy plane, due to continuously dropping bombs, collided and exploded, causing the fuselage to catch fire and emit thick black smoke, and crashed south of the Wenzaobang. Yesterday afternoon, another plane was shot down by our anti-aircraft guns and crashed at the Zhujiaqiao position. Also, from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM last night, enemy planes dropped up to sixty bombs near Zhenbei Bridge. The bridge was slightly damaged and was repaired overnight and is still passable.</p>
<h3>Enemy Mines Buried on Tiyu Road</h3>
<p>In the area behind Hongkou Park and along Dong Tiyu Road, around 7:00 AM on the 23rd, the enemy army dispatched over three hundred engineers to construct trenches, bury landmines, and set up electric fences. The Japanese Marines headquarters behind the Mindefang in Jiangwan Road has a woodworking engineering office attached to the Marines, with seventy to eighty craftsmen manufacturing small wooden boxes, the purpose of which is unknown.</p>
<h3>Hasegawa Apologizes on British Warship for Enemy Plane Killing British Soldier</h3>
<p>Okamoto also apologizes at the British Consul General's Residence; the body of the British soldier has been moved to the International Funeral Parlor</p>
<p>On the 24th, enemy aircraft extensively bombed and strafed with machine guns on the Xinan Temple Road and Kaixuan Road in western Shanghai, killing a British soldier, McGilivray, one. After the incident, the British garrison authorities immediately lodged a serious protest with the enemy. The commander of the enemy's Third Fleet, Hasegawa, personally went aboard the British flagship HMS Chulmleigh that night to apologize to Admiral Little, commander of the British China Fleet. At the same time, the enemy's Consul-General in Shanghai, Okamoto, also went to the residence of the British Consul-General, Phillips, to offer the same apology. The British garrison authorities issued a brief statement that night about the incident. According to news from the British Consulate, the body of the deceased British soldier has been moved to the International Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road, where technicians will perform an autopsy before the cremation. In addition, the British garrison authorities, because the Anhe Temple Road area is a residential area for British and American expatriates, and Kaixuan Road is a place where expatriates ride horses, in order to prevent similar incidents from occurring and to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, have advised expatriates not to ride horses on Kaixuan Road for the time being.</p>
<h3>Enemy Installs Heavy Artillery on Poyang Road</h3>
<p>Between the intersection of Hongri Poyang Road and Guiyang Road, the enemy has constructed an artillery position inside a certain wool factory, placing eight heavy artillery pieces. In addition, on the open space opposite the Changcheng Thermos Factory behind the Japanese military attache's office on Qimei Road, the enemy has an artillery position, firing towards Baoshan Road.</p>
<h3>Enemy Artillery Shells Fly to Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Innocent Civilians Tragically Injured</p>
<p>On the night of the 24th, our air force attacked five times, causing heavy losses to the enemy. They fired anti-aircraft guns wildly, causing stray bullets to fly everywhere. Anti-aircraft shells landed near Aiwanyi Road and Jing'an Temple Road, and there were also shrapnel on Difeng Road. In addition, No. 6, Langxingfang (transliteration) on Kangnaot Road, and a shed across from the Public Bus Company were all hit by anti-aircraft shells, injuring two Chinese. A Chinese woman was injured when an anti-aircraft shell landed on the roof of a Chinese-style house near Wenzhou Road and Xinzha Road.</p>

<h3>Invading Enemy Forces in Shanghai Exhausted</h3>
<p>Evidence from Several Small Matters</p>
<p>A Huadong News Agency reporter who went to the front lines to meet with various commanders learned that the enemy's invading forces in Shanghai have been exhausted. There are several small matters that can prove this: (1) The enemy regards the more than 400 land and sea cannons set up in Wenzaobang, Liuhang, and Luodian as valuable. After our army moved to the first line of defense on September 23 to avoid the threat of enemy warships, the enemy wished they could drag their warships ashore. Thus, they dismantled the cannons used on the ships and installed them on land. They must have put in a lot of effort, but it had no impact on our lineup. Moreover, when our army advanced, the enemy artillery positions were caught off guard and often abandoned their ship cannons and fled. (2) The enemy fears our attacks and is extremely afraid of sacrificing lives. Therefore, in every small squad, six to seven members are our Northeast compatriots. When we attack, the enemy must flee desperately. (3) The enemy occasionally mistakenly triggers our警戒line traffic trench. We will then launch a fierce attack. Our goal is to exhaust the enemy, so after the pursuit, we still return to our original positions. (4) The enemy consumes ammunition, approximately one million yuan per day. For example, every noon, the enemy must indiscriminately fire shells under the supervision of aircraft. (5) In the small town of Niao Luyi, the enemy will use more than 200 bombs to destroy one or two hundred civilian houses. Who pays the heavier price? It can be viewed in direct proportion from the front line.</p>
<h3>Mountains of Military Supplies Piling Up at Osaka Wharf</h3>
<p>Dozens of Trucks Transporting Still Seem Insufficient</p>
<p>According to someone who went to the Yangshupu area, at 6:00 AM today, three enemy transport ships, the Santoku Maru, Kobe Maru, and Kurama Maru, sailed into the Huangpu River and docked at the Osaka Wharf and Huangpu Wharf in Yangshupu. They immediately unloaded thousands of boxes of ammunition and bombs, and other military supplies, which temporarily piled up like mountains. Although dozens of trucks were transporting back and forth, it still seemed insufficient. In addition, the enemy transport ship Kōtoku Maru was docked at the China Merchants’ godown. It is said that the ship arrived in Shanghai last night and will sail back to Japan after loading the corpses today.</p>
<h3>Collaboration Between the Puppet Manchukuo and the Enemy Forces in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Organizing a National Sacrifice Major Intelligence Agency in Shanghai</p>
<p>The puppet Manchukuo government, in order to establish contact with the enemy authorities in Shanghai, has sent military attache Takahashi, who arrived in Shanghai on the 19th of this month and is currently residing at No. 65 Peng Road. It is understood that Takahashi's trip was in cooperation with Kawashima Yoshiko, planning to establish an international major intelligence agency in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Our Army Kills Over Ten Thousand Enemy Soldiers in the Past Week</h3>
<p>The 18th Brigade of the 6th Division Has Been Completely Annihilated</p>
<p>According to news leaked by the Japanese side, in the recent week of fighting in Shanghai, the enemy army suffered over 12,000 casualties in areas such as Wenzaobang, Guangfu, Luodian, and Jiangwan. Among them, the 18th Brigade of the 6th Division has been completely annihilated. Other Korean and Manchukuo puppet troops in Luodian and Liuhang also suffered approximately 4,000 to 5,000 casualties. These corpses are mostly transported to the Sanguantang Cremation Ground in the eastern part of Yuepu to be burned.</p>
<h3>Sumin Vocational School in Nanxiang Completely Destroyed by Enemy Aircraft; Diligent Management Reduced to Ashes</h3>
<p>Losses Exceed Ten Thousand Yuan; Ironclad Proof of Enemy Aircraft Destroying Our Cultural Institutions</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army's brutal invasion of Shanghai on August 3rd, it has spared no effort to destroy our cultural institutions. The Sumin Junior Vocational School in Nanxiang, founded by vocational education experts Yang Weiyu and others on the 15th of this month, was targeted by the enemy army due to its well-run operations and outstanding achievements. It was subjected to no fewer than dozens of enemy bombings. All school buildings, instruments, and school supplies were destroyed, with losses exceeding 100,000 yuan. This school was founded in 1934, and after the school principal, Mr. Lu Linxun, diligently managed it, school affairs developed rapidly. The number of students initially only numbered eighty to ninety, but later increased to two to four hundred year after year. It has repeatedly received praise from inspectors from various educational administrative agencies, so in the last semester, it was approved for filing by the Ministry of Education and registered by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education. Unfortunately, the school was tragically bombed by enemy aircraft this time. This reporter specifically asked Mr. Lu at the Zhonghua Haiziao Society and was immediately received. He made the following remarks: "Because I concurrently serve as the director of the Jiading People's Service Guidance Office and the standing chairman of the Jiading All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, I have never left Jiading even though enemy aircraft have carried out large-scale bombings. Recently, due to negotiating matters related to comforting the frontline soldiers and providing relief to refugees in the war zone, I ventured from Jiading to Shanghai on the 19th and will soon return to Jiading to continue working. The Sumin Vocational School has only been established for three years, and the difficulties experienced during that time are too numerous to mention. However, with a spirit of perseverance, school affairs have continued smoothly. Since the August 13th Incident, all teachers and students have participated in services in various war zones. Even within the Shanghai area, no fewer than dozens of Boy Scouts are providing service. Although the school buildings have been completely destroyed, the anti-enemy spirit of all teachers and students remains the same. The enemy army can inflict material damage on us, but the positive spirit of us will never be threatened by the enemy." He continued: "A large part of Jiading County is now in the war zone, and there are many people displaced to Shanghai. Many students in this county are particularly suffering from the hardship of being out of school. In order to provide relief for students' education, we have temporarily borrowed the address of the Zhonghua Women's Vocational School on Lafayette Road in Shanghai to start classes. All students from various schools in the county who come to the school to ask to audit are accepted. The school buildings of this school have been destroyed, and starting classes in a different location is a spiritual stimulus even greater than that experienced by various schools."</p>
<h3>Enemy Fears Our Air Raids, All Wharf Buildings Painted Black</h3>
<p>Six Times Reinforcements, 15,000 People Arrive in Shanghai; 800 Wounded Soldiers Set Sail Back to Japan Today</p>
<p>After the enemy's wharf buildings and godowns in the eastern district of Shanghai were repeatedly attacked by our air force at night, the damage was quite significant. The enemy army believes that the reason why the wharves were frequently hit by our bombs was that the roofs of the enemy wharves were mostly white, making it easy for our planes to use them as bombing targets. Therefore, over the past two days, they have repainted the buildings at the Osaka and Huangpu wharves black. Starting today, the buildings at the Mitsubishi Wharf will also begin to be painted gray-black.</p>
<p>Yesterday (24th), one of the enemy transport ships carrying the enemy's sixth round of reinforcements to Shanghai, the No. 186 Cnegon Maru, a converted merchant ship, docked at the Zhanghuabang Wharf. After unloading the reinforcements, it sailed to Yanshan Wharf this morning. Approximately 800 wounded enemy soldiers were carried onto the ship, which set sail back to Japan around 8:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>The third batch of the enemy's sixth round of reinforcements, has already taken enemy merchant ship that had been converted to transport such as the Kotoku Maru, Tianjin Maru, Mie Maru, Kurama Maru, Kōtoku Maru, Oregon Maru, transport ship No. 120, and seven others with unclear names, totally fourteen ships, to Shanghai, respectively on Zhanghuabang, Qiujiang, Osaka wharfs to land. The total number of this shipment reinforcements was fifteen thousand, belonging to enemy Chatsu Temple's 11th division.</p>
<p>The enemy's Tianjin Maru and Kōtoku Maru transport ships docked at the Qiujiang Wharf around 5:00 AM on the 23rd, carrying over 4,000 chemical warfare troops. After landing, they were dispatched to the Dakang Yarn Factory and the Shenjiatan Nankuili area at the end of Yangshupu Road for stationing. Around 6:00 PM that afternoon, they were dispatched to the Wenzaobang front line. The enemy's sixth round of reinforcements, 15,000 people, arriving in Shanghai yesterday and this morning, including 4,000 chemical warfare troops, have landed at the Qiujiang Wharf and immediately headed to the front lines. In addition, a large number of bombs were unloaded from the enemy transport ship Kōtoku Maru, which arrived at the China Merchants’ godown, starting this morning.</p>

<h3>British Peace Association Passes Resolution Advocating Boycott of Japanese Goods by All Countries</h3>
<p>British Awaiting Report Before Commenting on the Case of British Soldiers Killed by Japanese Aircraft in Shanghai</p>
<p>[London] The British branch of the World Peace Conference recently held a meeting here to discuss the Far East situation and the Spanish issue. It concluded today and passed a resolution requiring the British government to find ways to promote universal boycotts of Japanese goods by various countries in its territory. Lord Cecil, Chairman of the Branch, stated at today's meeting that he may soon retire and be replaced by a younger person as chairman, but he himself will continue to preside over the peace movement. (Havas dispatch on the 24th from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the incident in Shanghai where British defensive forces were attacked by Japanese aircraft, resulting in the death of a soldier from gunshot wounds, British authorities have declined to comment for the time being, only awaiting the acquisition of detailed reports before expressing their opinions. (Havas dispatch on the 24th from Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Brief Commentary</h3>
<p>— Phase</p>
<p>There are two unfavorable positions for our side in the Shanghai battle. And the superiority of the enemy's mechanized infantry is not one of them. One, the enemy's tens of thousands of troops are confined to a corner, and we take the shape of encirclement. The enemy is in the situation of being surrounded. In military tactics, it is said that a surrounded army must have a gap. If there is no gap, there is fear of being trapped in a stubborn fight. This is one disadvantage. Two, strategically speaking, the enemy takes the offensive, and we are on the defensive. The front line extends for dozens of miles. If there is any negligence in the guarded area, there is a risk of breakthrough at any time. Therefore, military tactics say, "Encircle if you have ten times the strength." It is not enough to talk about encirclement unless there are more than ten times the forces. Now, our army's strength is by no means ten times greater. And the enemy's mechanized infantry is so fierce and violent. And our loyal and brave army can actually trap tens of thousands of enemy troops in a corner. It has lasted for more than two months. So that the enemy cannot break out. It is appropriate for foreigners to praise the magic of our country's use of troops.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Continue to Bomb This Morning</h3>
<p>Due to urgent needs in this port this morning, enemy aircraft from the Yangshupu area only flew out around 7:00 AM. Initially, there were four teams of two aircraft each. Later, teams of three aircraft took off one after another. Among the enemy aircraft in teams of three, one aircraft served as a guide, resembling a fighter jet and smaller in size, with a gray-white color. Behind it followed two heavy bombers, with a gray-black color. Occasionally, when passing through Zhabei, they made a circling motion, circling around once and heading northwest. From then on, they shuttled back and forth continuously. In Zhabei, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, every hour there were three enemy heavy bombers dropping bombs on the section between Zhongxing Road North and Liuying Road South in northern Zhabei. The first bombs dropped landed between Gonghe Xin Road East and Song Park Road, which is a field area, so most of the enemy bombs did not explode. The second and third bombs mostly landed on the section between Song Park Road East and the eastern end of Zhongxing Road, where there are more houses, so about a dozen civilian houses were destroyed.</p>

<h3>Traveling to Bingzhou (2)</h3>
<p>— Shi Ren</p>
<p>One Day in Shijiazhuang</p>
<p>Arriving at Shijiazhuang, the first line of defense on the Pinghan Railway, it was already 4 AM on the second day. The sky was not yet light, and small carts of the Zhengtai Railway were constantly running. Our brave soldiers were stepping onto the front lines to defend the territory of the motherland!</p>
<p>In recent years, I have read many enthusiastic writings by young people who say that the anti-Japanese sentiment of the Chinese army is extremely high, especially the 29th Army. Although this kind of publicity is meant to show the situation of the Chinese army, it actually exposes the weaknesses of these troops.</p>
<p>We know that, in psychological terms, so-called "emotion" is the most intense form of feeling, not something that is immediately known. Strong external stimuli can trigger sudden bursts of this emotion, but once there is an opposing force that suppresses it, the emotion will recede like a flood collapsing a dam. However, in contrast to emotion, anti-Japanese consciousness is the highest ideal. The healthier the consciousness, the more confident we can be in resisting Japan. Simply having high emotions only leads to the passivity of enemy soldiers on the Pinghan Railway. We cannot deeply blame the soldiers for this situation but should instead criticize the weakness of political training in the army on ordinary days. This feeling is especially strong when I personally observe the political education of the Central Army and a certain other army.</p>
<p>Not only are there many straggling soldiers on the Pinghan Railway, but there are also many bandits and traitors. Nearly ten items were stolen on our train alone, and several traitors were also caught. This situation symbolizes the deteriorating political power in the north and the difficulties of the war on the northern front.</p>
<p>There was supposed to be a passenger train at six o'clock, but due to special circumstances, it was canceled due to a lack of locomotives. This led me to find a small inn to rest temporarily, planning to take the evening train to Jingxing, but later it was rumored that there would be no evening train either, and whether there would be any passenger trains in the future was also a question, which made me feel anxious. I thought to myself that I had joined the army with my pen and traveled thousands of miles to Shijiazhuang, only to be stopped outside Niangziguan. I felt gloomy, with a myriad of thoughts swirling in my mind.</p>
<p>At 3 PM, I suddenly heard an air raid alarm. I and a student companion from Beijing and Tianjin ran to the suburbs to take shelter. There were about twenty-three attacking planes, circling back and forth, stubbornly bombing the station and the power plant. After the event, investigations revealed that the stone bridge of the Zhengtai Railway station was slightly damaged, as were some tracks and houses, but the power plant was unscathed.</p>
<p>This air raid on Shijiazhuang was the first in about a week, with the worst happening around September 18th. Today's air raid targeted the Zhengtai Railway and not the Pinghan Railway, which shows that the Japanese already knew about our actions on the Zhengtai Railway last night. This is undoubtedly a gift from the traitors. According to the innkeeper, Shijiazhuang is a major base for traitors, with seven or eight people being arrested every day. During the September 18th Incident, Japanese planes bombed more than a dozen cellars because the traitors placed umbrellas and white clothes at the entrances of the shelters. Most of these traitors were rickshaw pullers, and some workers of the Pinghan Railway were also arrested because the transportation industry easily allows for the transmission of information, which was exploited by the enemy.</p>
<p>Therefore, the bombing of the planes disrupted the evening train of the Zhengtai Railway, which really worried me. The refugees gathered at the station waiting for the train were also discouraged by the news of the train cancellation. Shijiazhuang was even more miserable and chaotic due to the bombing.</p>
<p>A young military officer sighed to me, "Alas! I didn't expect the situation in the north to be like this? The people are neither organized nor willing to listen. For example, this destroyed stone bridge, if it were in [some unspecified place], we would have mobilized the people and repaired it in an instant."</p>
<p>As long as they are young people, they can feel the condemnation of all the evil forces in the north. In the courtyard of the inn, the commander of a Central Army battalion lectured his platoon leaders, in addition to cautioning them about shooting, charging, and other tactics, and also mentioning the heartbreaking stories of the two-year operation on the Pinghan Railway. I really couldn't bear to write these stories for the readers.</p>
<p>The day in Shijiazhuang was threatened by airplanes, and the night in Shijiazhuang was disturbed by fleas, leaving me sleepless all night.</p>
<p>On the Zhengtai Railway</p>
<p>Leaving the pit at four o'clock, I rushed to the station during the curfew at half past nine, knowing that there would be a passenger train at seven or eight o'clock, which made me very happy. Then, after passing the dangerous Niangziguan, I would be able to gallop on the battlefield of national liberation.</p>
<p>The train entered the station at half past seven and departed at eight o'clock. The car was so crowded that it was impossible to move. The Zhengtai Railway carriages, as small as matchboxes, wound their way through stacked mountains and meandering streams. The scenery along the way is comparable to the Ping-Sui Railway, much better than the boring flat plains of the Pinghan and other railways.</p>
<p>There is nothing worth noting on the Zhengtai Railway, except that it stopped due to an air raid in Yuci. This train is conservative, narrow, and slow, symbolizing the true face of Shanxi.</p>
<p>Arriving in Taiyuan, it was already dark. After being searched by the military police, I went to the YMCA dormitory. On the road, I saw the dark streets of Taiyuan and the shadowy figures of soldiers.</p>
<p>Before entering Niangziguan, I had a passionate desire to bring some good and pleasant news to the readers, but Shanxi made me sad. I stayed in Taiyuan for more than a day, but I heard many hateful and sad stories. I met Mr. [Name Omitted], a reporter from Ta Kung Pao, who talked to me about the situation on the front lines, making me understand that before the unfolding of a new era, all acts of sugarcoating and stubborn resistance will be shattered. In this great chaotic crucible, new and real things will be forged.</p>
<p>Originally, I wanted to stay in Taiyuan for a few more days, but because there were no urgent matters in Taiyuan, and because there was a truck going to the front lines today, I left Taiyuan, which was being bombed every day, and headed to [Location Omitted]. What I saw and heard along the way was heartbreaking, but I held back the pain and walked towards the front lines with the songs of the young comrades of a certain army. I thought that this move would bring clarity, that the old and stubborn would eventually have a day of cessation and collapse, and at the same time, I would see a new and bright side.</p>
<h3>Special Report on the Battle of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Wang Jinqi, Military Reporter for the Central News Agency</p>
<p>1.  The Battle for Luodian</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai War on August 13th, our loyal warriors took the initiative and fiercely besieged the enemy's strongholds in Hongkou and Yangshupu. After ten days of bloody battle, the enemy was almost unable to breathe. The enemy's dream of a quick victory was completely shattered by us. So the enemy changed their strategy, trying to land at various ports along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, extend the battle line, and contain our forces in Jiangwan and Zhabei. On the evening of August 22nd, a large number of enemy warships gathered in the Chuanshakou and Shizilin areas, releasing smoke screens and forcing a landing. Although we had deployed considerable forces along the riverbank, flesh and blood could not withstand the enemy's fierce artillery fire. As a result, a large number of enemy troops, equipped with new and sharp weapons, charged forward from the riverbank. Our defending troops, forgetting all difficulties and determined to coexist with the position, fought to the death with the enemy, but eventually, due to the disparity in numbers, they were overrun by the enemy troops in places like Baoshan, Shizilin, and Yuepu, and reached Luodian. If our reinforcements could not arrive immediately, could not block the enemy, and could not drive the enemy back, then the Battle of Shanghai would immediately be greatly affected. Therefore, the battle for Luodian was truly an important key to the Battle of Shanghai. General [Name Omitted], known for his swift use of troops, immediately ordered the deployment of the Peng and Xia Divisions to Luodian when the enemy troops charged toward Luodian. Li's division quickly advanced from Jiading, and the vanguard of Peng's troops arrived in Luodian very quickly that evening and engaged in a fierce encounter with the enemy. Although the enemy used heavy troops with the latest weapons and unleashed fierce firepower to threaten us, none of our soldiers failed to bravely advance, charge into the enemy's positions, and fight hand-to-hand with the enemy in the midst of a dense rain of bullets. After nearly seven or eight hours of fierce fighting, they finally stopped the enemy's advance and inflicted heavy casualties on them. A map and diary found on the body of an enemy engineer captain revealed that the first enemy troops to land were the 43rd and 47th Regiments of the Army and the 11th Engineer Regiment. These three regiments were the most elite troops of the Kurume Division of the enemy army.</p>
<p>On the 24th, the Li and Xia Divisions arrived in Luodian, and our military strength was further enhanced. We frantically attacked the enemy. The enemy troops near Luodian were completely cleared by us. In addition to Li's division being responsible for the defense of the line from Luodian to Liuhe, the Peng and Xia Divisions also advanced northwest. The enemy had suffered such a severe blow from our troops in Luodian, and because they had not yet gained a firm foothold, they could no longer block our main force. Therefore, our army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy and recovered Baoshan, Shizilin, Yuepu, and other places.</p>
<p>Of course, the enemy's ambition to capture Luodian to control Taicang and Jiading and threaten our Zhabei-Jiangwan line will not stop there. Therefore, at dawn on the 25th, the enemy's support troops landed in places like Shidong and Xiaochuansha, and under the cover of a large number of airplanes and warships, they charged toward Luodian again. At this time, our fortifications in Luodian had not been built very solidly, and the troops of the Peng and Xia Divisions had advanced northwest. Li's division had a longer defensive line, and the troops in Luodian were not very strong. At the same time, the town of Luodian was densely bombed by enemy planes and warships, like scattering beans. All the civilian houses were almost completely destroyed, and the unfortified positions were also mostly damaged. Most of our guards were forced to retreat, leaving only one battalion of troops to desperately defend this Luodian town, which had no fortifications to rely on. Around 8 PM, the troops of Li's division in the Liuhe area hurriedly transferred a regiment of troops, led by Brigade Commander Cai Bingyan and Deputy Brigade Commander Li Weifan, and immediately gathered all the original garrison troops near Luodian, taking advantage of the darkness to charge into Luodian town. Although the enemy had sharp weapons, they could not stop the loyal and brave blood of our soldiers. Especially with Brigade Commander Cai and Deputy Brigade Commander Li personally present on the battlefield, leading the charge and fighting bloody battles, they eventually drove the enemy back. However, our loyal brigade commander and deputy brigade commander sacrificed their lives for the country in this battle. What a glorious and touching sacrifice!</p>
<p>On the evening of the 27th, our second deployment was to attack Chuansha Town. This mission was still undertaken by the Peng and Nong Divisions, who drove the enemy troops there to the river and completely annihilated them. However, because the artillery fire from the warships was too dense, our troops could not establish a firm foothold by the river. The enemy landed new troops and launched a third attack on Luodian. From around 8 AM on the 28th to around 3 PM, the bombing by airplanes and artillery did not stop for a minute. Flying sand and dust enveloped the entire town of Luodian. The remaining houses and positions were subjected to a final baptism. Our loyal soldiers still defended desperately, preventing the enemy from easily charging in. It was not until dusk that the enemy used dense machine guns, small steel cannons, and tanks to attack our positions. After a considerable period of resistance and a heroic sacrifice, our guards had to withdraw from Luodian under the serious threat of enemy firepower. At this time, our Huo Division had just arrived in Jiading from [Location Omitted] and was ordered to immediately rush to the front line to reinforce it. Every soldier stepped on the sacred journey of defending the country with great joy and charged into the line of fire with a bang. At the same time, the main force of the Peng Division was also ordered to advance westward, and together with the Huo Division, immediately launched a third counterattack against Luodian. After five hours of bloody battle, with more than ten charges, the Peng Division went from southeast to northwest, bravely reclaiming the southern half of Luodian town in the dark. The Huo Division also attacked from west to east, where the enemy had set up two barbed wire fences to block our army's advance. Our army disregarded their lives, continuously destroying the enemy's barbed wire and charging into Changqiao, north of Luodian, where there was an enemy listening post command, surrounded by more solid defensive fortifications. Inside, an enemy commander was killed by us, and dozens of enemies were captured. The number of enemies killed was even more countless. We captured one enemy small bronze cannon, eight light and heavy machine guns, pistols, charts, telescopes, riding horses, and bicycles, as well as many documents. However, we also suffered considerable sacrifices.</p>
<p>This time, due to communication obstacles between the Peng and Huo Divisions, the two sides could not coordinate with each other. At the same time, the Huo Division was blocked by rivers in the middle of the night, so it was not able to achieve complete success. After the 29th, the two sides occupied half of Luodian town, vying back and forth, and the continuation continued day and night. At one point, our army surrounded Luodian town on three sides. We should have been able to completely annihilate the enemy, but the right wing position changed a bit, and we had to retreat the encircled eastern position by several hundred meters. From this battle for Luodian, the enemy fully recognized the fighting spirit of our army and did not dare to act rashly. This situation continued to the present, and the two armies are still confronting each other in Luodian.</p>
<p>In the past ten days, the enemy has used all their strength to attack in the battle for Luodian town. In addition to the threats from a large number of airplanes and heavy artillery, the number of infantry is also extremely strong. The enemy numbers we have discovered are the 22nd, 43rd, 44th, and 47th Regiments, totaling at least one division of landed enemies. Under the three-dimensional attack of their naval, land, and air forces, they originally wanted to defeat us in one fell swoop, but our army fully demonstrated the spirit of combat, the tactics of assault, the vigorous morale, and the loyal and brave blood. The crystallization of these forces is stronger than iron. The enemy's plan has been crushed by us. The enemy, held in one corner by me, has already known that it is a difficult task to break into our position. (Sent October 19th)</p>
<h3>Enemy Shells Destroy Houses at Shanghai-Minhang Station</h3>
<p>Last night, when our planes attacked enemy bases, Japanese warships in the Huangpu River shone with searchlights and indiscriminately fired anti-aircraft guns aimlessly, causing stray bullets to fly around the Nanshi area. The lead roof of the Shanghai-Minhang long-distance bus station at the head of Guohuo Road was hit with a hole. A bullet fell and broke through the floor. Fortunately, the bus company had already closed, so there was no one in the house and no casualties.</p>
<h3>Transshipment Measures</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Requests Ministry of Finance to Establish Procedures</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting measures to remedy the payment of transit taxes and establish sub-transportation procedures. The telegram read, "To the Nanjing Ministry of Finance: According to a letter from the China Chemical Industry Society, regarding the newly established transit tax measures, after goods arrive at a certain place, they are disassembled and packaged separately for sale in another location. We are willing to establish a sub-transportation license procedure. We have sent personnel to the Customs to inquire, but there are no clear regulations. We declare the sales location when we request the sub-transportation license, so that there is proof of transit and tax-free release. However, it is difficult to limit the quantity at the time of initial transportation and determine that it is for sale in a certain place. Therefore, the Customs sub-transportation license cannot be issued. When the goods are in transit, they will still be subject to transit tax because there is no proof of tax payment, which will lead to repeated taxation at each stage. Even if the quantity and sales location can be determined to obtain a sub-transportation license, the cost of packing small boxes will inevitably increase greatly, and the original paper and cardboard must be discarded. Considering the way to cherish resources in extraordinary times, the matter is not appropriate. Our company believes that this matter is related to the cost of manufacturers and is closely related to their interests. Without a thorough plan, it is difficult to maintain rear production. We hereby continue to earnestly request your association to forward this to the Ministry of Finance for a clear explanation to facilitate commercial transportation. We are extremely grateful, etc." After arriving at the association, how to remedy the two difficulties mentioned by the company? We hereby telegraph to your department, respectfully requesting that you clarify and indicate compliance, which is truly in the public interest. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully."</p>
<h3>Guangzhao Association Encourages Fellow Villagers to Donate to Public Bonds</h3>
<p>The Guangzhou Zhao Association in this city yesterday announced to fellow villagers from Guangdong in Shanghai, "The violent enemy is insulting us, and the country is in danger. The death of the country is equal to the death of the family. All our citizens should know this righteousness. In the past European wars, war bonds were mostly raised to enrich national power and fight for national survival. The government of our country has issued national salvation bonds this time to enhance the ability to resist the war, and our citizens' purchase of national salvation bonds is the only way to save the country and the natural duty of our citizens. The national salvation bonds bear an annual interest rate of 4%. Those who purchase the bonds are contributing to the country on the one hand and saving and earning interest for themselves on the other, which is convenient for both public and private. There is nothing better than this. Our Cantonese fellow villagers have always been patriotic and will not lag behind. We hope you will enthusiastically subscribe to the bonds, the more the better, and even a small amount is acceptable. The minimum amount of the bonds is 5 national currency units, which is a way for our citizens to fulfill their patriotic aspirations. If you have a share of strength, you should fulfill a share of duty. Regardless of the amount of bonds purchased, our association will be happy to purchase them on your behalf. In addition to direct fundraising, we hope that you will be aware of the pain of national subjugation and quickly pay to our association to purchase the bonds in order to help the country."</p>
<h3>Consolation Committee Requests Purchase of Medical Supplies for North China Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Consolation Committee yesterday received a letter from the Chinese Red Cross Society, which stated, "This association has repeatedly received reports from various parties that the Jinpu Railway war is in full swing, and there is a great lack of medical supplies and rescue personnel. We should find ways to provide assistance. We have submitted this to the 12th joint meeting of the Standing Council and Supervisors of this association for discussion, and it was resolved to consult with various groups that when collecting goods to console the Jinpu Railway, medical supplies should be the main focus. We hereby record the case and request your association to take note of it. In the future, when soliciting comfort items for the Jinpu Railway army, please be sure to try to pay more attention to medical supplies," etc. In the future, all sectors of society should purchase medical supplies as much as possible to console the soldiers in North China.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Money Trade Association to Convene Meeting Today to Discuss Domestic Market</h3>
<p>Approximately 30 Million Yuan in Loans Due at the End of October; Each Bank Will Allow Flexible Extensions</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the long-term credit loans for Shanghai industry and commerce are due at the end of October, the Shanghai Money Trade Association will convene a general meeting of member bank representatives at 2 PM today to discuss the domestic market and hold an executive committee meeting to discuss various issues related to the end-of-October loans. A reporter inquired at the Money Trade Association this morning and learned that the total amount of loans due at the end of October for the 46 member money shops is approximately 30 million yuan. Although the banks have notified the borrowing factories, merchants, companies, etc., due to the full-scale war of resistance, all borrowers have been affected by the war and cannot repay on time. Therefore, they have all been allowed to extend the repayment period from one month to six months. As for the market's daily overnight loan rate, it is 1.2%, but the number of interbank loans is very small, which is very different from before.</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Thanks Danyang Fellow Villagers for Consolation</h3>
<p>Our Eighth Route Army has repeatedly won victories in the battle in northern Shanxi. The Danyang Fellow Villagers Association in this city previously sent a telegram of condolence, which Chairman Yan has replied to and thanked. The original telegram read, "To President Ma of the Danyang Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, 26 Shandong Road, and also to Han Jingqi, Pei Yuanding, Dong Xiaoqian, Liu Zhemin, and He Yunsheng, esteemed standing directors: Your telegram has been read and understood. The Eighth Route Army's victories in the war of resistance are far-reaching and praiseworthy. It has already been conveyed to Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The comrades of your association have pledged to be the rearguard, sharing the hatred of the enemy. It is greatly appreciated." "Telegram Reply Thank You Yan Xishan (Deleted and Printed)"</p>
<h3>Organizational Committee of the Support Association Opens Engineering Training</h3>

Registration locations: Bide Primary School, 68 Lafayette Road; Mei Hua Girls' High School, 100 Carter Road. Registration time: from now until the 18th, from 2 PM to 4 PM every day.</p>
<p>Wartime Youth, Issue 21</p>
<h3>Writing for Youth in Wartime</h3>
<p>— Guo Woli</p>
<p>Engaging in national liberation movements under the control of Japanese imperialism is an extraordinarily arduous task! It is certainly not something that can be achieved through localized battles; one must raise the banner of mobilizing the power of the entire nation to resist oppression.</p>
<p>Under this banner, especially the trained and organized youth, are the backbone, and their position is of utmost importance and their responsibilities are arduous beyond compare. Therefore, we should be vigilant and spur ourselves on, striving to be powerful cornerstones in this movement. Thus, we must have profound self-reflection and thorough preparation. What is discussed here are a few common cultivations that our youth should have in the all-out resistance against Japan!</p>
<p>1.  All great undertakings are based on vigorous strength; if one's body is weak and one's spirit is listless, one's work will inevitably be a "flash in the pan" and one will not be able to see it through to the end. In wartime, affairs are busy, and one toils day and night. If one allows oneself to be depleted without paying attention to cultivating new physical strength, how can one "bear heavy burdens and travel far?"</p>
<p>2.  Knowledge is the source of wisdom. Substantial knowledge can transform one's temperament, make one's mind nimble, one's understanding clear, and one's methods superb. It can bring into play the role of being astute and capable, which leads to great achievements. The wartime environment is complex, and one must deal with a multitude of issues. One should especially read publications and extensively study specialized works that are beneficial to national salvation. It is best to "not forget reading while resisting Japan, and not forget resisting Japan while reading." The two should advance in a cycle, so that new wisdom is constantly generated to deal with the treacherous, ever-changing front lines of the invasion, without becoming flustered and overwhelmed.</p>
<p>3.  Youth are often easily swayed by the tide, mistakenly going astray. This is because they lack a fixed central idea and cannot grasp the wandering thoughts of a "mind like a runaway horse." Now we need a strong anti-Japanese front. Youth in this front must firmly establish the Three Principles of the People of national salvation as the central idea, and resolutely hold the belief of "either the enemy dies, or I die; either I live, or the enemy lives" to sacrifice for the national struggle, so as not to be tempted or shaken by any evil forces and traitors.</p>
<p>4.  When affairs are busy, prompt action is all the more precious. With prompt action, it will not be difficult to improvise and increase work efficiency. At this moment, one must shoulder several tasks and move forward in order to complete the sacred mission as soon as possible. If one wants to make one's actions prompt, one must always be mindful at work, self-reflect, and strive to avoid laziness and slowness. Over time, one will naturally cultivate this habit.</p>
<p>5.  Youth are at the height of their vigor, and they often ignore reason and emphasize emotion, "aiming too high" and "seeing no one else in their eyes," unconsciously exposing the weaknesses of arrogance and pride, which easily lead to negative impressions from the outside world. This is a lack of cultivation, so one must always examine oneself, striving to correct what one has, and encouraging oneself when one has none. Resistance work is the responsibility of all the people, and it is by no means the duty of any particular part. For example, if those with money are unwilling to give it, we must try to move them with a sincere heart and a gentle attitude. We must never resort to the low-level action of scolding.</p>
<p>6.  As the war is fierce and enemy planes are rampant, we must be bold and careful when we go in and out of the hail of bullets, concentrating our minds and spirits, and defending ourselves and protecting others at all times and in all places. We must use reason to the fullest extent to guard against enemy attacks and avoid unnecessary sacrifices. However, if one is martyred while saving wounded soldiers on the front lines or serving the suffering people, or joining the battle, this is the inevitable result of a rational "sacrifice for righteousness," which is by no means comparable to being reckless and suffering an accident. Therefore, we must learn wartime knowledge and skills of air defense and poison gas defense beforehand so that we can use them in time to deal with situations with ease.</p>
<p>7.  Finally, we must achieve the great cultivation of "forgetting self for the sake of the public." If one only knows the public and does not know oneself, one can overcome all "attention-grabbing" and "five-minute fervor" that start from oneself and enter the inner layer of practical service. With the integrity of "exerting oneself to the utmost until death" for the public, one can eliminate the negative factors of perfunctoriness and complacency. Therefore, being faithful to one's duty is what the youth in the resistance war today should pay particular attention to.</p>
