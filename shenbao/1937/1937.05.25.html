<h3>汪主席講國民大會之三基礎</h3>
<p>紀律與自由不是相反正是相成　由共同的信仰認識感覺而行動</p>
<p>［南京］廿四日晨汪氏在中央黨部紀念週報告、原文如次、</p>
<p>各位同志、自從五全大會决定召集國民大會以來、代表選舉已開始進行、去年冬間雖因事延期、而自三中全會决定淤今年十一月十二日召集以後、代表選舉事務、又從新進行了、在這進行的程序中、有許多問題都有待於研究和解答、有些人說、現在是以黨治國的時候、國民大會旣然由本黨政府召集、不用說、是本黨黨員佔絕大多數了、那麼非演員的意見、是否能在國民大會中自由發揮出來呢、關於此一問題、雖然初選當選的人數、現在還沒有精確的數目、而據最近中央的調查、統計、大約區域選舉本黨黨員與非黨員各占半數、職業選舉則本黨黨員比較多數、自選舉法修正以後、於複選中廢除圈定、便更增加了自由競選的機會了、那麼將來的國民大會全體國民的意見、均有自由發揮出來之機會、是更無可疑義的、於是又有些人說、雖然這樣、但依照法律的規定、凡為國民大會的代表、必須矢忠矢信於三民主義、不問其是否為本黨黨員與非黨員、那麼如果有一部分人不願意依照此規定的、不就失了參加國民大會的機會麼、不就使一部分人失了自由發揮意見的機會麼、關於此一問題、似乎有研究和解答之必要、將來的國民大會、對於國家的根本大計、要得到一致的决定、這是無疑的、如今所要問的、是如何纔能得到一致呢、從一方面來說、各個人的利害不定一致、各個人心中所抱之是非觀念、不定一致、因之其要求也不定一致、如果一併抹煞、則有束縛個人自由之嫌、然從另一方面來說、若各個人之利害是非繁然雜陳、而不能歸於一致、則紛紛擾擾、將無已時、其結果一盤散沙、對內沒有團結力、因之對外沒有抵抗力、必然的走上了亡國滅種途徑、從來講紀律的蔑視自由、以此為放縱、講自由的、憎惡紀律、以為狹隘酷烈、其實自由與紀律、不是相反、正是相成、紀律是必要的、沒有紀律、不能使散沙成為水泥、但是個人之服從紀律、不是由於被動、而是由於自動的精神、自發的情緒、這是人與物之別、紀律是由於各個人之自動的精神、自發的情緒而造成的、方纔是人的紀律、而不是物的紀律、向來講紀律的、往往忽視這一點、這不可不予以矯正、（未完）（二十四日中央社電）</p>

<h3>賑欵保障問題</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>川災嚴重待賑孔亟。亦已為舉國周知之事實。財部於四月上旬撥發賑欵公債一百萬元交由賬務委會核實散放。不嫌杯水之微權充先路之導。原冀川省災黎卽能沾得實惠。而各方慈善團體。必且聞風響應源源輸將。則積尠致弘。集腋成裘。亦何難使刦遺餘生。得資潤澤。廣漢災區漸就康復。不意事隔月餘。而川紳來電。竟飛未領分文。同時復傳川省府擬將賑欵劃留。轉令各區稅務督察處籌借抵撥在川災盼振雲霓同殷之際。而發生如此迂緩複雜之波折。不特丁厄災民備形恐慌主管當局。急欲查究。卽在吾輩局外人士。以休戚同情之所關。亦誠有不勝其灼慮者矣。</p>
<p>自川中謠諑重燃以來。邊省情形之山入。久榮吾人之心懷。矧茲賑欵。急如星火。構遭覊滯。史駭聽聞。雖此事旋經查明以公債售現而濡時。以待凑整數而稽匯。在財部去電查究之日。該欵業已電匯到蓉。至所傳劃留籌墊一節。亦經財部負責人聲稱。祇是一種擬議并未見諸實行。眞相是否如此簡單。原非吾人所欲深究。唯因循愆失。業已昭著。卽就玩忽賑務一點而言。亦有使人不能自安於緘默者。當局對此若無明白嚴正之表示。誠將何以策懲毖至計於日後吾人則更因此而聯想到一切賑欵應子保障之問題。</p>
<p>辦賬為慈善事業之一以我國人士浸淫道德觀念之深。勸募者常覺勢有易至。解懷者認為義所當然。故在賑欵集中以後。一任當事者之處理。絕不致有此微之懷欵。誠以當事者所負良心上之責任。實遠勝於一切律法之裁制也。輓近災祲遍地變故迭乘民生憮悴。物力疲敝勸募旣頻。常苦不𢥧。集欵之難。迥非昔比。㫿常人體念災民顚沛流離之窘况。宛轉待斃之慘象。雖在拮据之中亦未嘗不思以一籌之差勝。破慳囊而從命。辦賬人員在苦爾艱蹶局勢之下。固宜以己飢己溺之懷抱。劍及應及而將事。斷不容有遷延之情實。增災民之疾苦。萬一竟有非分之圖。侵及賑欵安全。則必使仁人寒心。義士短氣。而本無慷慨之俠腸者。反得利此為消極之藉口。影響所暨。匪特在厄災民。失所救濟。將使整個賑務。發生動搖。為未雨綢繆計。當局誠應以如何妥善之方法。謀巖欵切實之保障乎。</p>

<h3>洛基斐勒影</h3>
<h3>洛基斐勒小傳</h3>
<p>昔太史公有言曰、君子富、好行基德、小人富、以適基力、淵深而魚生之、山深而獸往之、人富而仁義附焉、其美國巨富洛基斐勒之謂乎、</p>
<p>洛氏一生、初半專務集財、後半財專務博施、故以巨富而獲世界慈善家之令名、洛氏恒曰、“余信為人責當以忠道竭力博取金錢、繼乃就所能而盡以施人、”故洛氏積資博施之習、一若出自天性、自其就職領薪之日起、分文之出入、輒詳紀靡遺、其所藏第一號帳册中有紀曰、“某日施某貧婦金五角”、“某日施某老者金二角五分、”此可證明洛氏之樂萬好施、不自中年攘有巨資而後始也、</p>
<p>洛氏雖富而能節飲食、忍嗜慾、故克臻上壽、當年近九旬時、嘗告人以攝生之祕曰、“毋憂思、毋求體胖、日飲淸水三小器、按時作健體運動、多吸新鮮空氣、”故洛氏一生不吸烟飲酒焉、洛氏之壽、雖多賴攝生之善、然其為人心氣和平、未嘗有見其疾言厲色者、蓋其宗敎信仰甚堅、對於博愛之旨、守乏維護、斯所謂仁者壽歟、富而不驕、此猶難能可貴者也、特洛氏近年切抱壽臻百齡之願、本年七月將足九十八齡、距百齡之目的、僅差兩歲餘、多金不能延短期之壽、死生有命不亦信哉、</p>
<p>洛氏以一八三九年七月八日生於紐約之里樞孟德鎮、父操旅行醫士業、家殊貧寒、故對於洛氏督責綦嚴、十齡甫過、卽敎以貿易之道、而怛使其操勞役、遺其越山購木柴、雖跋涉長途不之恤焉、故洛氏嘗曰、“鄉間子弟具入世有所建樹之决心、其幸運非富家子弟夢想所能及”云、</p>
<p>洛氏童年卽事儲畜、閱數年、積金五十元、乃以七厘息貸諸鄉人、年十四助鄰人掘芋三日、日勞十小時、僅得酬一元許、洛氏因而有感、默思勞三日汗流浹背、而所獲猶不及五十元子金三之一、故儲蓄之志益堅、分文不輕用焉、一八五三年、其家徙居俄亥俄州之克里夫蘭鎮、洛氏乃肄業高校、嗣以無力入大學續求深造、乃入某商校、納三月之費、而以六星期盡習所授之簿記法與懋遷術、一八五五年八月中旬、洛氏開始覓求職業、日輒自晨八時起、迄晚七時止、奔走炎陽下、四出探詢、如是者一星期、終無所獲、第洛氏不為氣沮、至下星期一晨、復奔走如故、歷六星期而不輟、至九月二十六日、始受雇於某公司、任貨棧助理簿記員、洛氏此後輒於每年是日舉行慶祝、以為紀念焉、</p>
<p>洛氏之就職也、初不知可得酬幾何、歲終、服務達三月許、主人酬以五十元、次年月獲酬二十五元更一年增至五十元、洛氏服務之動、金錢出入錙銖必紀、且有向所認為無望之舊債洛氏亦為設法歸得、故甚獲主人靑睞、年十八、其薪金已增至歲七百元、洛氏嘗以八百為請、而未償願、洛氏就職數年、所儲約反千金、乃作自求發展計、入市詳察後、更向父借得千金、合已所有而與英人克拉克設經濟商行、定名曰、克拉克洛基斐勒公司、克當時較洛長十歲、</p>
<p>一八六二年、本薛文尼亞州油業蓬勃、洛氏乃注目於此、邀安特魯斯為助、商行改名安特魯斯克拉克洛基斐勒公司、而經營油業焉、一八六五年、三人决以至高之價、出售所營之商行、洛氏復展其告貸之才、而以七萬二干五百元購得之、仍請安氏為助理、適時勢巧合、其營業乃得一帆風順而獲利倍蓰、洛氏在此初年、已以克已節儉、誠信可恃、不染惡疾之佳靑年、見稱於商界矣、</p>
<p>迨油業發達已臻極度、洛氏乃以其餘資經營他業、嗣成全國銀行之世擘、其銀行規模僅差英倫銀行一籌耳、洛氏復機密組織鐵路制度、其制度之內容、雖未嘗有人聞知、而洛民實為鐵路世界之巨子、說者謂鐵路大王哈里曼之得名、全有賴於洛基斐勒與摩根之協助云、洛氏並以數千萬金錢投諸煤氣•電氣•地產•中央各州各市之價券•與電車流輪、且置有海洋河湖之商船數百艘、</p>
<p>政府逼於輿論、嘗一再企圖遏止洛氏事業之繼續發展、故法院曾下諭解散標準油托辣斯、第洛氏仍經營紐遮西州標準油公司、與其數百分行如故、洛氏之財力確已稱霸世界、故已故羅斯佛總統惡之殊甚、數數痛斥之、說者謂羅斯佛能知洛基斐勒、而洛基斐勒不能知羅斯佛、夫身已躋登國家最高職位、而仍厭惡財富、𧶡願手創大事業、而不屑孳孳求利、堅决反對集財於一人、而不忍使博取微資之平民增高其生活費、其懷抱自屬非儿、洛氏何不能鑒及於此乎、</p>
<p>洛氏與其所營標準油公司之遭人挾擊也、為前所罕覩、著作家不絕於雜誌書籍中為文以毀之、而與洛氏同業者則責洛氏藉金錢之勢力、壓倒競爭、甚至僱用私人、窺探所與競爭諸公司之內容、洛氏此時幾有為富不仁之名矣、第洛氏與其同夥堅持其素主之政策、置譭言於不顧、而緘默經營其事業、洛氏等嘗屢次被傳至法院議會委員會而受祇責、然輒以辯之成理而勝訴、最可注意之一案、厥在一九○七年由芝加哥法院傳洛氏至庭作證、繼判印第安那標準油公司於被控之一千四百六十二欵、每欵繳罰鍰二萬元、第後由最高法院平反、故此罰金終未繳納也、</p>
<p>一丸一一年最高法院執行希爾曼反對托辣斯法令、勒令標準油托辣斯解散、但解散後所成之各部分、其發達甚至較前直接由一處統制時為甚焉、洛氏在紐遮西標準油公司解散前之十五年、已不每日至行辦公、然仍負該公司總理之名、至解散時始已、</p>
<p>一八六四年九月、洛氏與阿克朗商人之女結婚、女士為一八三五年克里夫蘭高校之窗友、伉儷同度理想之生活、幾達五十一年、洛夫入平日除欵待家庭之友好外、不甚與聞社會活動、居恒以訓育子女為限、並從事敎會與星期學校之工作及慈善各舉、夫人於一九一五年三月患心疾逝世、夫人嘗有數年不能親蒞敎堂、報由其良人節錄主敎之宣講歸餉之、洛氏夫婦生子女五、一死襁褓中、餘為三女一男、三女均嫁、惟幼女已逝世多年矣、</p>
<p>洛氏至中年、積財之半已為世界歷史上個人所罕有、年五十七、始不與聞營業事務、而從事散其資財、前後三十五年中、散施之縛數逾五萬萬元、其同事某氏嘗言洛氏辭世之日、世人當以洛氏資產比較為少而驚異也、洛氏資產究有幾何、多年來為羣衆猜測之資料、而從未披露其實數、或謂多至二十二萬萬元、據接近洛氏者稱、遠在此數之下、洛氏之子嘗謂從未連十萬萬之數云、惟紐約城納財產稅者、多年來以洛氏為冠、年輒在一百萬元以上、洛氏在其慈善事業中、欲解决散去資財而不使受者賴此為生之難題、故集合有經騐之顧問而設立慈善團、其中犖犖大者、為洛基斐勒基金處•普遍敎育會•洛基斐勒醫學研究院•及洛基斐勒夫人紀念金等、浴氏嘗自說明其旨趣謂“余親自籌劃幾致精疲力盡、未有充分指導而砍在慈善事業之廣大範圍中、獲一透澈方法而不可得、余不獲已、乃組織此團、其所沿以進行之途徑、以猶吾人之治他事也、余希望余能助成散財之效率、庶資財在今代及後代可得更大用途、如能敎人自助、則吾人可銷除世界許多罪惡之根矣、</p>
<p>洛氏之散其財也、不求其速、但期其適當、當其初以十萬元贈與芝加哥大學前、曾對於該校之需要、權其緩急而後給之、迨見其校務發達、乃陸續補助之、如是者二十年、對於該校共捐助三千五百萬元、對於其他事業亦然、洛氏嘗自謂曰、“可增進文明之最重要元素之一、厥為道德與宗敎之進步”、洛氏在俯視赫曾河之波南蒂斯山上、置有大厦一所、洛氏精計算、嗜高爾夫球、按時入敎堂、每晨六時輒起、當年逾八旬時、猶矍矍如少年、面常有笑容、好幽默、勤勞致富、雖細事不稍疏忽、各種賭博皆所嫉視、洛氏從未經營證券市塲之投機事業、辦事不獨有恒、且常在戒心、行路從容、出語徐緩、言不多發、但皆中肯、八十三歲打高爾夫球時、强勁猶昔、平生對於幼孩幸福至為注意、其一生最重要之格言為“不工作則决不能有快樂生活”、素性不喜宣傳、新聞記者有欲得其祈聞資料者、當碰壁焉、</p>
<p>一日洛氏在波南蒂斯山上打高爾夫球、有一新聞攝影家、攀十五呎高墻而入、持照相機趨至其前、洛氏詢以何自而入、攝影家囁嚅少頃、以手指墻、洛氏乃曰、一旣從此入、卽從此出可也、但仍准攝影家攝取其影、而後注視其踰墻而去、</p>
<p>洛氏在一九三六年七月憂祝其九旬晋七之誕辰、仍照以前廿五年來之往例、開家庭大宴會、子孫多人悉參加焉、（路透社）</p>

<h3>福州營業稅糾紛解决</h3>
<p>商界停業抗稅一瞥　省府新訂納稅辦法</p>
<p>福州通信、福建財廳、自上年整理全省營業稅以來、成績甚好、只以近日省會一部份商人、誤解法令、認為稅額比上年度增加、抗不繳納突於十四日上午停業、要求减低稅額惟中小商號均照常開門營業、旋經浙閩監察使陳肇英調處、已於次日下午復業停業期內、秩序如恒、茲將其經過詳情誌之如後、</p>
<p>初辦情形</p>
<p>福建普通營業稅、自民國二十年裁厘後舉辦、巳經六年、惟以當時倉卒開辦、章制闕如、僅就各縣情形、配定比額、各縣或以派額招人包辦或令商幫認繳或仍征厘金式之通過稅、任意攤派絕少成績、最初有一百九十餘萬、降至二十五年不及百萬、又省府自閩變迄去年止、先後廢除苛雜三百餘萬、省庫大絀、遂不得不整理賦稅、因於去年三月、依照財部營業稅法、訂定征收章程並製定整理計畫綱要、委派人員分縣調查評定稅額按冊征收，所有以前辦法、悉為除去、此為圖治者應取之道也、</p>

<p>滸浦海口、現正黃魚汛上市、惟每一魚船於卸去魚貨之後、船中即有多量監涵留存鄉間貧民、每多携備桶器、前往裝盛、作為調味、或充田中肥料、但駐鄉稅警、以鄉民爭取此項監涵、有關官鹽之銷路、例須禁止、故每船於卸貨後、強令將𣶓傾入海中、前日有一部分貧民、盛取鹽𣶓歸家、詎為稅警所見强將傾去、於是賴以生活之貧民千餘人（其中以婦女老嫗估多）集中海口、與稅警發生爭執警隊雖持槍驅散、婦等亦堅執不去察其目的、似欲稅警通融盛取鹽𣶓、刻由魚行主事等在調解中、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>“剷共”與“讀經”</h3>
<p>— 洪法</p>
<p>在西遊記裏，我記得有這麼一段故事：孫行者雖然法術無邊，然而牠却最怕觀音大士唸金剛咒。當這位齊天大聖在地上要作怪的時候，她就不動聲色地，只要暗地裏，把金剛咒唸一下，那圈在這位猴王頸上的箍兒就越發緊起來，以致牠痛得尿屎直流，非要跪地求饒不止。</p>
<p>每當我看到這裏的時侯，就不免要發生疑問：難道所謂經典這東西，果眞具有這樣微妙的效用嗎？</p>
<p>可惜的是現在這經文早已失傳；可幸的，是現存的有些經文，尚還有具着這樣微妙的作用在。</p>
<p>中國的經書，雖說數目很多，然大都含着萬世不磨的哲理，則為從來學者們所承認的。“半部論語，就可以治天下”。這陳言且不說了，而在宋朝時候，也眞有一位宰相，坐在城頭上，看見敵兵來攻，他抱着一本經書，拚命的唸着，相信這樣做，可以呌敵人退却的。</p>
<p>可見經書這東西，在我國，向來的心目中，是被視為和百齡機同樣具有意想不到的效力。雖然這麼說，有些近於侮辱牠的嫌疑。</p>
<p>但卽使悔辱也罷！牠的具有十分神奇的效力，却是眞的。我們只要看歷史上經學的盛衰，與世運的升降，兩者老是維持着分不開的關係，這道理，就總可以相信罷。遠的且不說，最近的例子，如五四運動興起後，邪說橫行，有人倡言打倒孔家店廢除舊禮教，毀棄固有道德之說，於是而全國靑年學子，中毒若狂，靡然風從，不久以後，淸黨到來，也就有許多人，死於盲目的信仰之下。這時候到眞的雲霾四散，天下都廓然澄淸起來。</p>
<p>然而這澄淸的結果，其代價，却是以生命和血滴換來的。邪說勢張，欲從而熄滅之，到非要借重於武力不可。卽如馬日事變，其所以遽告平息者，亦由於“焦頭爛額之功”也。</p>
<p>最近湘省政府主席何鍵，在二十一日湖南剷共紀念大會上演說，反覆闡揚剷共與讀經之關係，而歸結於剷共尤宜不忘讀經，這道理的重要性，在其三中全會提案中，已深切的說過。現在只不過是於紀念週上把牠再來申述一下而已。由此可見耍熄邪說，就不能不讀經。讀經如不中用呢？就只有動手來“剷”了。“剷”是武力，而“讀經”是文治：文治與武力，二者互用着，才能收相得益彰之效。諸君小見穆罕默德的傳敎，就是一手執劍，一手執可蘭經的嗎？</p>
<h3>廢除死刑</h3>
<p>— 允西</p>
<p>關於死刑的應否廢除問題，記得曾經有一個時候，惹起了很大的論爭，不過後來不知怎末一來，這一論題，竟會因“死刑的能否廢除”這樣一轉，却很巧妙地再轉成了對於死刑的改良了。其實，當時所謂感慨絞刑，斷頭台之類於受刑者過於殘酷，而設計改良死刑，使受刑者减少痛苦；很不客氣說句，倒有點像一個“死刑藝術欣賞者”在考究着一個受刑者在受刑過程中的美，後來有些國家改用電刑，或許就是這一班“死刑藝術欣賞者”的研究結果；而也就是死刑應否廢除的答案了。</p>
<p>當然，我們承認死刑的應否廢除問題的牽涉非常廣泛，尤其是對於死刑者本身的研究，爭論甚大。而也許更有人會承認一個犯罪者的生存，足以影響後一代的安寗，但死刑的廢除，最近我們却居然看到作為一宗議會的議案討論，且被通過了。下面是本月十九日各報的一段小新聞：</p>
<p>“美國本薛文尼亞州，哈利斯堡城電：本州州議會頃以一百票對八十七票，通過議案主張廢除死刑”。</p>
<p>以十三票的差數而擊敗反對廢除死刑論者，相信是經過一番頗為熱烈的論爭的。然而，到底通過了，在這可證明死刑的廢除在今日的無辜殺戮已成為一件合法的行為的血腥世界，是提出如何嚴重的抗議：而對於“因拒絕赴西班牙作戰，意兵二百被槍决”。這一類新聞，又是七首般的多末强烈的諷刺。</p>
<p>因此，廢除死刑在人權已失保障，一個獨裁者可以隨便踐踏他的人民的世界，是具有非常積極的意義的。但是在司法的本身，廢除死刑的提倡，却老實不客氣地可以說是很不够的。卽就美國本身論吧，白人對黑人的隨便使用非法的私刑，雖也曾當作一件嚴重的事來指斥過。但習俗的縱容，若干無罪的黑人却遭了法律所不能保障的毒手。在私刑這一反法律的行為還未能予以有效的處置的時候來談廢除死刑，眞呌人有點不大相信。</p>
<p>當然，我這樣說並不就是反對廢除死刑，而是對廢除死刑更加以補充。這卽是說，在我們感覺到死刑確有廢除必要的時候，我們更應想到其他比死刑更殘酷萬倍的刑罰，更應以相當的方法處理。譬如近日的新聞中，我們常看到維持治安的機關對於尚未能認定是否犯罪的人的虐待，對這種不合理的私刑的反對，相信是應該先於呼𥸤廢除死刑的。例如十八日報載：“酷刑逼死竊盜嫌疑犯周阿品，法醫已檢騐鑑定屬實”。那無論在人權保障上在司法上，總是不合理的吧。如果我們忽略了這些比死刑更殘酷的非法的私刑而談廢除死刑，那是沒有意義的。</p>
<h3>在雲朗河棧</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>—山行雜什</p>
<p>轉過為口堊，許是中暑吧，抬我和老鐵的伕子躺下了，嘴里吐着白沫，眼往下垂，醬紫色的臉上掛着一層靑白，這樣，我們被摔下來。我擦破了肘皮，而老鐵却跌傷了膝蓋。</p>
<p>急亂中想不出相當辦法，伙伴們已經走得老遠了。我們沒有辦法，祇以銅板蘸了自已的口水沒命的在他的背脊上和臂窩里刮起來，現出紫紅的條印。然後，讓另外兩個伕子抬一乘滑桿，把他們兩個安置在桿里，另一乘由我們肩起來，打起輕鬆的術語，爬，喘氣，歇在雲朗河棧上。</p>
<h3>公所</h3>
<p>在街口，就圍了一羣人，鬧吵吵好像發生了人命一樣，想去觀望一面，但桿子緊套在頭上，不容你分身，及至卸去枷鎖再跑出來，熱鬧仍沒有走散。</p>
<p>主角不多，共有三位，其中兩個年紀差不多的是弟兄，而年長的一位正是在這村子里小負盛名的監工。原因很簡單，他們都是田家人，因為要修路，但修理並無“的欵，”於是征工。這工作是頗為浩大的，全線共有多長，劃成幾個階段，每個階段里所佔的是那一節，這一節里包有多少村子，每個村子里又有若干能够應用的壯年。然後，估計一下工作的時間和需工多少，於是，定當了。假使這一段需分四期完成，就把征工的全數劃成四部，不論是什麼天氣，被劃進某一部的工作者得負荷了艱巨，執行他本分的職務。</p>
<p>工餉是沒有的，做活一天，準領飯食費一兩毛。不做當然也辦得到，估計你工作的期限，把費用貼出來是可以，雇工”來代理的。</p>
<p>貧瘠的鄉村，對於錢猶如自已的血，“貼費”被看做越過本身的生命。掙扎着，扛了鋤頭，鐵鏟，把石塊掘下來勻整的安置在路上，一頂右架的木橋，一段碎石舖就的路面，在相繼的完成了。</p>
<p>但，他們都是農民呵！雖然是些山田，也不能隨便的放棄。可是，飯食錢呢？</p>
<p>兩個壯年的小伙子大概眞惱了，靑的筋一掀一掀的跳—</p>
<p>—憑良心想想，做一個多月，只發十天！跟着，指頭點到他的鼻尖上：人心都是肉長的，尅扣發不起胖來，知道麼？</p>
<p>看熱鬧的人一陣騷亂，喝嚒，呌喊，笑，弄成一團糟。監工軟下去，頭提不起來，短布衫上的汗鹹酸，掠過人們的鼻孔，那埋在濃重烟癮中的面色更加靑灰了。</p>
<p>—這個，這個，怪不得我，我只是監工，錢，要由公所里交下才成！</p>
<p>—公所？那姓孫的崽兒也不是好貨，你們都在串連，……之後，這一羣都擁到公所里。</p>
<p>公所是由一座廟宇改成的，挺寬闊，也很破舊。第二進院子里還搭了架“高脚戲台”，台底下能自由的出入，左面耳廂里設有私塾，學生也有三四十，敎員是個老頭，講解時候，學生也跟了敎員的“榜樣，”把整個身子全部搖擺幌動着。右耳廂的床上，也許就是姓孫的所長吧？那一把年紀離墓門已沒有多遠，這時，正橫陳一榻，吞霧甚濃。</p>
<p>意外的煩擾，使他非常不高興。到底“所長”自有他的威嚴，不能像與監工談話時那樣隨便。結果，沒有出於意料，關於錢的問題一口推脫了！</p>
<p>—這事，我看非進城不可。他吐了口烟，因為這是由城里支配的呵！</p>
<p>進城，眞不是易事，大熱天，路遠超超來回要走好幾天，還得丟下田里的活計。城，不是平常人隨便去得的，說</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>不定得到的除去敷衍或責罵外，依然是一塲空虛。</p>
<p>怒氣全消了，看着廟簷下倒掛的金馬鈴聲，也許要認爲這是自己的“命運，”懷着悽淸，帶了夕陽走出去。所長笑了，投過去一條輕篾的眼光，又躺到床上。公所里又被古暮的寂寞鎖住了。</p>
<h3>背縴夫</h3>
<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>—要背縴的嗎？</p>
<p>—僱個短工吧，一吊五百錢一整天，不折不扣送你老八十里路</p>
<p>夜來停泊在埠頭上的船隻，往下遊去的，一個個都援起錨來。長竹篙點着河堤，把船撑向河心，舵公悠然的坐在船尾，撑穩了舵，一些也不吃力的，瞬息間，船像片急風中的落葉似的，順着汨汨的水流，向着那遙遠處，跟藍陰陰的天上一絲浮雲樣的，迎着金光燦爛的太陽，樹林和村莊留到後面，輕盈的，如一匹紫衣的小燕子，掠過水面，那麼平和的航行。</p>
<p>一隻駛往上遊的貨船還停在那里，管船的以傲然的神情立在船頭，跟岸上一羣餓鴉似的縴夫，爭吵的講着價錢。</p>
<p>縴夫們用一張慣兜生意的嘴，訴說出他們的苦痛！</p>
<p>—一吊五百錢還多呵？俺們要吃頓晌午飯的咧！八十里的逆水，趕上頂風俺就回不得家嘍，野地里睏一夜倒沒啥，老婆孩崽正等錢買糢吃！</p>
<p>管船的一切都瞭然，他們購的都是實情，然而每人名下仍要减去二百錢，像選買牲畜般的，挑出了六個黑大强壯的漢子。</p>
<p>縴板套上每個人的肩胛，一條條的縴索結到一根粗的麻繩上，那麻繩牢牢的縛住了船上的將軍柱，船夫們齊聲的唱出無字的歌，宏亮的歌音中伴着鐵鏈的啷啷聲，船錨被拖了起來，船立刻如斷了根的萍梗，在水面上蕩着，隨了水勢，漸漸要往下遊退去，但被幾枝長篙探進水里，定住了，篙杆彎得如同弓背，水頑强的嘩刺嘩刺的響着，岸上的縴夫站成一行，齊聲的發喊，身子向前傾下去，他們並沒有跌倒，船却慢慢地動了。</p>
<p>船上載的全是核桃紅棗之類的乾果，麻袋堆集着有人多高，分量重，吃水深，船腰差不多跟水皮平了，黃泥湯似的河水，不凝靜的打着船頭，激起幾個漩渦，又分向兩舷流去。</p>
<p>縴夫們把全身的精力貫注在縴板上，用同是一樣的那精啞嗓子，哼着：</p>
<p>“哼呵，噯阿，哼噢，噯噢……”</p>
<p>河岸兩旁不斷地有一二間草屋，屋前的柳樹下，有漁人們閑談或補破網，他們彼此是熟識的，拉縴夫這時常直直腰，抹一下額上黃豆大的汗珠，問他們捎不捎什麼東西，漁人們無限苦情的搖着頭，停下竹針，直看着他們消失在河灣處。</p>
<p>貨船的主人燃着長的乾烟管，一袋又一袋的噴出灰色的烟霧，他摸着自己肥大的乳峯，跟舵公講着生意的難為：</p>
<p>“走上水船，要三天半的路程，脚費三十塊大洋，除咱們人工伙食，一切小零碎開銷，剩下的不够在天津三森不管睡一夜婊子的！”</p>
<p>舵公換了換胳膊，像怪認眞的說：</p>

<p>“他那是魚口，我不是像去，是想攢個錢給城里學手藝的兒子娶房媳婦！”</p>
<p>兩個人覺得那個夢，未免大荒唐了，便不再講話，到了中午打尖的時候，船拋了錨，縴夫們打懷里取出汗水浸濕的大餅，坐在草地上往口里塞，那麼慌張的該令人罵餓死鬼，管船的看看日影，𦁯着眉頭說：</p>

Later, due to various difficulties reported by various places, requests for postponement were made. This office considered the urgency of the meeting and the difficulty of promoting it. As for how to deal with it, the actual situation in various places was reported to the government for instructions. It was decided at the 23rd meeting of the Central Standing Committee that the election of representatives to the National Assembly could not be completed as scheduled according to law, and the meeting should be postponed. It should be convened after representatives from all over the country are elected according to law, etc.' Later, at the third plenary meeting of the Fifth Central Executive Committee in February of this year, it was decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12th of this year. This office also believed that since the assembly has a fixed date, various elections should continue to be completed in order to facilitate the convening as scheduled.

Another telegram was sent in April, and it was limited to be submitted to the office before May 10th. They have still not been sent in full, so there is no way to review them.

(1) Before the end of September, this office will compile the general lists of representatives and submit them to the Congress. The above measures will be circulated for implementation. However, according to the situation of the initial elections, various places have not been able to handle them in accordance with the procedures. If it is delayed again, it is feared that the National Assembly will be missed. This office is responsible for supervising at any time in order to complete it as scheduled. In addition to sending telegrams to various provinces and cities, if the forms have not been sent in full, they will be reported by the end of May. The reasons for re-establishing the procedures for handling elections are hereby reported in writing, requesting approval for passage and compliance, and please instruct them to handle them within the time limit in order to emphasize the election. " According to this, it should be approved and implemented. In addition to separately telegramming various election supervisors and election supervisors to comply and handle them within the time limit, this order should be transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and various provincial and municipal election supervisors and election supervisors for joint compliance, and they should be transferred to comply separately.

Although it was postponed last winter due to certain events, since the Third Plenary Session decided to convene it on November 12th this year, the election of representatives has restarted. In this process, many questions need to be studied and answered. Some people say that now is the time of party rule, and since the National Assembly is convened by the Party's government, it goes without saying that Party members will be in the vast majority. So, can the opinions of non-Party members be freely expressed in the National Assembly? Regarding this question, although the exact number of those elected in the preliminary elections is not yet known, according to a recent central investigation and statistics, Party members and non-Party members each account for about half in the regional elections. In the professional elections, Party members are in the majority. Since the revision of the election law, the abolition of designated candidates in the second round of elections has further increased the opportunity for free competition. It is therefore beyond doubt that the opinions of all the people will have the opportunity to be freely expressed in the future National Assembly. Then, some people say that even so, according to the provisions of the law, all representatives of the National Assembly must be loyal to the Three Principles of the People, regardless of whether they are Party members or non-Party members. So, if some people are unwilling to abide by this regulation, will they not lose the opportunity to participate in the National Assembly? Will it not deprive some people of the opportunity to freely express their opinions? Regarding this question, it seems necessary to study and answer it. The future National Assembly must reach a unanimous decision on the fundamental plans of the country, which is beyond doubt. Now, the question is, how can we achieve unanimity? On the one hand, the interests of each individual are not necessarily consistent, and the concepts of right and wrong held by each individual are not necessarily consistent, so their demands are also not necessarily consistent. If they are all erased, there is a suspicion of restricting individual freedom. However, on the other hand, if the interests and rights and wrongs of each individual are complicated and cannot be unified, then there will be endless chaos, and the result will be a disunited mess, with no internal cohesion, and therefore no external resistance. It will inevitably lead to national subjugation and racial extinction. Those who advocate discipline despise freedom, considering it to be indulgence, and those who advocate freedom hate discipline, considering it to be narrow and cruel. In fact, freedom and discipline are not opposites, but complementary. Discipline is necessary; without discipline, loose sand cannot become cement. However, the individual's obedience to discipline is not due to passivity, but to an active spirit and spontaneous emotion. This is the difference between humans and objects. Discipline is created by the active spirit and spontaneous emotion of each individual, and only then is it human discipline, not material discipline. Those who advocate discipline often overlook this point, which must be corrected. (To be continued) (Central News Agency dispatch from the 24th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Problem of Relief Funds Guarantee</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The disaster in Sichuan is serious and urgently needs relief, which is a well-known fact throughout the country. In early April, the Ministry of Finance allocated 1 million yuan in relief bonds to be verified and distributed by the Accounting Committee. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it serves as a guide. It was originally hoped that the disaster victims in Sichuan Province could receive substantial benefits, and that charitable organizations from all sides would respond and contribute continuously. Then, accumulating small amounts to achieve great things and gathering strength, it would not be difficult to enable the survivors to obtain resources for restoration. The disaster area in Guanghan is gradually recovering. Unexpectedly, more than a month later, a telegram came from Sichuan gentry, stating that they had not received a single cent. At the same time, it was reported that the Sichuan Provincial Government planned to retain the relief funds and transfer them to the tax supervision offices in various districts to raise loans for offsetting expenses. When the disaster victims in Sichuan were looking forward to the relief as if they were looking forward to clouds and rain, such a slow and complicated twist occurred. Not only are the victims of the disaster extremely panicked and the responsible authorities are eager to investigate, but we outsiders, concerned about the common weal and woe, are also genuinely worried.</p>
<p>Since the rumors in Sichuan have rekindled, the difficult situation in the border provinces has long been in our hearts. Moreover, the relief funds are as urgent as a spark. It is shocking to hear that they are being detained. Although this matter has been clarified that the public bonds were sold for cash and delayed in order to gather the full amount, the funds have already been telegraphed to Chengdu on the day the Ministry of Finance sent a telegram to investigate. As for the reported retention for loan offsetting, the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance also claimed that it was only a proposal and had not been put into practice. Whether the truth is so simple is not what we want to investigate. However, the delay and loss have already been revealed. Even if we only talk about neglecting relief work, it is enough to make people feel uneasy and unable to remain silent. If the authorities do not make a clear and stern statement on this, how can we plan to learn from mistakes in the future? We will therefore think about the problem of ensuring all relief funds.</p>
<p>Managing accounts is one of the charitable causes. Because the people of our country are deeply immersed in moral concepts, fundraisers often find it easy to raise funds, and those who contribute consider it their duty. Therefore, after the relief funds are collected, they leave it to the managers to handle, and there is no suspicion of misappropriation. This is because the responsible persons bear a moral responsibility that far exceeds the restraint of all laws. Recently, disasters have spread everywhere, changes have occurred one after another, people's livelihoods have been difficult, and material resources have been exhausted. Fundraising has been frequent, and it is often difficult to collect funds. The difficulty of collecting funds is very different from the past. Even ordinary people, mindful of the plight of disaster victims who are displaced and destitute, and the tragic sight of lingering death, even in their own difficulties, still think of contributing. Accountants, in the face of such difficult and arduous situations, should act with a sense of hunger and drowning, and do things as quickly as possible, and should not delay, increasing the suffering of disaster victims. If there is any improper intention to encroach on the safety of relief funds, it will inevitably make benevolent people feel chilled and righteous people discouraged. Those who have no generous chivalrous hearts will take this as an excuse for inaction, and the impact will not only be that the disaster victims will lose their relief, but also that the entire relief effort will be shaken. For the sake of preventing problems before they occur, the authorities should seek a proper method to ensure the safety of relief funds.</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Asks About Smuggling in North China</h3>
<p>Japan Does Not Assume Responsibility for Smuggling; Britain Does Not Agree with Japan's Views</p>
<p>[London] Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne said in the House of Commons today in response to a question from Conservative MP Moreing that the Japanese government has consistently denied responsibility for smuggling in North China in its negotiations with the British government, believing that smuggling is caused by China's high tax rates and insufficient administrative efficiency. Japan cannot prevent such behavior. The British government stated that while China's tax rates may be too high, the British government does not agree with the Japanese government's views. The British government will naturally pay close attention to this matter. (Reuters dispatch from the 24th)</p>

<h3>The League of Nations Has a Poor Impression of the Armistice Proposal in Spain</h3>
<p>Germany's Reply to Britain Indicates Agreement in Principle; Both Sides of the Spanish War Refuse to Consider It</p>
<p>[Geneva] The diplomatic community of the League of Nations has a very poor impression of the British proposal for a temporary armistice between the two sides of the Spanish Civil War at the time of the withdrawal of foreign volunteers. Some even call it a "British trick" to prevent the Council of the League of Nations from being embarrassed. The Spanish government representative refused to consider an armistice, and a spokesman for the rebels called it "foreign interference." An Italian representative was even more suspicious of the British plan, believing it was only beneficial to the government forces. In mid-December last year, Britain and France also proposed a ceasefire and a referendum by the Spanish people. At that time, the Spanish government's accusation against Italy and Germany for interfering in the civil war was shelved by the Council of the League of Nations, but nothing has been heard about the referendum since then. (National Telegram from the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain, the correspondent of Le Petit Journal in Geneva recently stated that no matter what decision the Council of the League of Nations makes, as long as its purpose is to withdraw the volunteers, the representative of the Spanish Republican Government, the former Foreign Minister Mr. Alvarez del Vayo, will be able to accept it. On the contrary, if the Council intends to mediate between the two parties involved in the internal strife in the country and advocates a truce, the representative of the Republican Government will definitely oppose it. (Havas dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>[London] The British government recently proposed to the countries concerned that the two sides of the Spanish Civil War should temporarily cease fire so that volunteers from various countries can withdraw from the country. Regarding this matter, diplomatic sources have confirmed that the German government's reply has been delivered to London. The content expresses agreement in principle with the Spanish ceasefire plan, but at the same time explains that there are many difficulties in implementation and asks Britain to pay attention. Diplomatic sources believe that this German reply shows a more compromising attitude, which is beyond doubt. Future negotiations can be based on this. As for the Italian reply, it has not yet been issued. According to news from Rome, it will not be sent until the Italian Foreign Minister Ciano returns to the country from Hungary. The Soviet government has also not yet submitted a reply. The Non-Intervention Committee in the Spanish Civil War is now scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss the report of the expert committee, which proposes several of the most appropriate ways for the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries for consideration. However, this is completely different from the British government's contact with various countries, which is intended to facilitate the work of the subcommittee. (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)</p>

<p>[New York] One of the world's wealthiest men, the Coal Oil King Rockefeller, passed away at 4:05 this morning in Daytona Beach, Florida.

He was known for philanthropy during his life, spending vast sums on charitable causes and transferring a large portion of his assets to his son. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>⊙Florida, Ormond Beach: The cause of death of American Coal Oil King Rockefeller, as announced today by his personal physician, was hardening of the heart muscle, i.e., heart failure due to old age. He had no final words. In the days before his death, Rockefeller was more active than in recent years, often driving around the vicinity of his villa. Usually, he lived reclusively, heavily guarded, like an ancient castle in feudal times, with little contact with the outside world. (23rd, National Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙Tarrytown, New York: A spokesperson for the Rockefeller family announced today that Rockefeller's funeral will be held at Pocantico Hills. Reverend Fosdick of the Riverside Church in New York, commonly known as the Rockefeller Church, will officiate. Only Rockefeller's family will be allowed to attend. It is confirmed that Rockefeller will be buried with his late wife in the Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland. (23rd, National Telegram)</p>
<p>[New York] The world's richest man, Rockefeller, passed away yesterday. The total value of the businesses and properties he controlled throughout his life was estimated to be over $550 million. In his later years, his annual income was around $50 million. His initial investment in the oil fields of Pennsylvania was only $75,000. His business strategy involved absorbing competitors and merging them into a large trust, namely the Standard Oil Company, with a capital of millions of dollars. Rockefeller was not only skilled in business but also charitable. The amount he donated to public welfare and charitable causes throughout his life has not been accurately tallied, but it was reported to exceed $500 million a decade ago. He is most admired for the Rockefeller Foundation, with a total value of $182,704,000, followed by the General Education Board, totaling $129,197,000, and the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Fund at $73,875,000. In addition to these three major foundations, he donated $46,000,000 to the University of Chicago, approximately $40,000,000 to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, $21,000,000 to the International Education Board, $20,000,000 to church-related businesses, $3,050,000 to the New York Public Library, approximately $3,000,000 to the Public Health Bureau, and $2,500,000 to rebuild the Reims Cathedral near Versailles, France, which was destroyed by artillery fire during the war, restoring its former splendor. These are just the major donations. Furthermore, he donated around $3 million for the construction of the International House in New York for students from various countries to reside, the construction of the League of Nations Library, the construction of the Hull Zoological Laboratory, and the donation to unemployment funds. His private fortune is estimated to be around $100 million. The title of "Coal Oil King" is now inherited by his son. (23rd, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Rockefeller's Shadow</h3>
<h3>A Brief Biography of Rockefeller</h3>
<p>Sima Qian of old had a saying: "A virtuous man, when rich, delights in performing good deeds; a petty man, when rich, indulges his desires. The deep pool breeds fish, the deep mountain attracts beasts; when a man is rich, benevolence and righteousness follow." Could this not be said of the American tycoon, Rockefeller?</p>
<p>Rockefeller dedicated the first half of his life to accumulating wealth, and the second half to extensively giving it away. Therefore, he gained a reputation as a world-class philanthropist despite being immensely wealthy. Rockefeller always said, "I believe it is a man's duty to faithfully and diligently acquire money, and then to the best of his ability, give it away." Thus, Rockefeller's habit of accumulating wealth and giving it generously seemed to be innate. From the day he started earning a salary, he meticulously recorded every penny he spent. In his first ledger, there were entries such as, "Gave five cents to a poor woman on a certain day," "Gave twenty-five cents to an old man on a certain day." This proves that Rockefeller's love for philanthropy did not begin after he amassed a fortune in middle age.</p>
<p>Although wealthy, Rockefeller was able to control his diet and desires, hence his longevity. When he was nearly ninety years old, he once told people the secret to maintaining health: "Do not worry, do not seek to gain weight, drink three small cups of clean water daily, exercise regularly, and breathe plenty of fresh air." Therefore, Rockefeller never smoked or drank alcohol throughout his life. While Rockefeller's longevity was largely due to his good health habits, it was also because he had a peaceful and kind temperament; no one ever saw him speak harshly or angrily. He had a strong religious faith and steadfastly upheld the principles of universal love. This is what is meant by "the benevolent enjoy long life." Being rich without being arrogant is even more commendable. In recent years, Rockefeller cherished the hope of reaching the age of one hundred. This July, he would have been ninety-eight years old, only two years away from his goal of one hundred. Money cannot prolong a short life; destiny in life and death is indeed believable.</p>
<p>Rockefeller was born on July 8, 1839, in Richford, New York. His father worked as a traveling physician, and the family was very poor. Therefore, his father was very strict with Rockefeller, teaching him the ways of trade when he was just over ten years old and constantly making him work hard, even sending him to buy firewood across the mountains, not caring about the long journey. Hence, Rockefeller once said, "Rural children who have the determination to achieve something in the world are luckier than wealthy children can imagine."</p>
<p>Rockefeller began saving money as a child. After several years, he accumulated fifty dollars, which he lent to the villagers at seven percent interest. At the age of fourteen, he helped a neighbor dig potatoes for three days, working ten hours a day, and only earned a dollar. Rockefeller was thus moved and thought silently that the earnings from three days of sweating labor were less than one-third of the interest on his fifty dollars. Therefore, his determination to save money grew stronger, and he did not spend a penny lightly. In 1853, his family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where Rockefeller attended high school. Later, lacking the means to continue his studies at a university, he entered a business school, paying for a three-month course, but mastering the subjects of bookkeeping and commerce in six weeks. In mid-August 1855, Rockefeller began looking for a job, running around under the scorching sun from eight in the morning until seven in the evening, inquiring everywhere. He did this for a week, but found nothing. However, Rockefeller was not discouraged. He resumed his search the following Monday, continuing for six weeks without stopping. On September 26, he was finally hired by a company as an assistant bookkeeper in a warehouse. From then on, Rockefeller celebrated this day every year to commemorate it.</p>
<p>When Rockefeller took the job, he initially did not know how much he would be paid. At the end of the year, after serving for about three months, the owner paid him fifty dollars. The following month, he was paid twenty-five dollars, and after another year, it increased to fifty dollars. In Rockefeller's work, every penny of income and expenditure was meticulously recorded, and he even managed to recover old debts that were previously considered hopeless. Therefore, he was greatly favored by the owner. At the age of eighteen, his salary had increased to seven hundred dollars a year. Rockefeller once asked for eight hundred but did not get his wish. After working for several years, Rockefeller had saved about a thousand dollars. He then planned to seek his own development, and after detailed observation in the market, he borrowed another thousand dollars from his father, combining it with his own to establish a commercial firm with an Englishman named Clark, named Clark &amp; Rockefeller Company. Clark was ten years older than Rockefeller at the time.</p>
<p>In 1862, the oil industry in Pennsylvania flourished. Rockefeller then focused on this, inviting Andrews as an assistant. The firm was renamed Andrews, Clark &amp; Rockefeller Company and began operating in the oil industry. In 1865, the three decided to sell their business at the highest price. Rockefeller once again demonstrated his ability to borrow money and purchased it for $72,500, still employing Andrews as an assistant. Coincidentally, the circumstances were favorable, and his business flourished smoothly, yielding multiple times the profit. In these early years, Rockefeller was already known in the business world as a promising young man of self-discipline, thrift, integrity, and good health.</p>
<p>As the oil industry reached its peak, Rockefeller used his surplus funds to engage in other businesses, eventually becoming the world's largest shareholder in national banks, with a scale second only to the Bank of England. Rockefeller also secretly organized a railway system. Although the details of the system were never known, Rockefeller was indeed a giant in the railway world. Some say that the railway tycoon Harriman owed his fame entirely to the assistance of Rockefeller and Morgan. Rockefeller also invested tens of millions of dollars in gas, electricity, real estate, bonds and stocks of central states and cities, and streetcars, and owned hundreds of merchant ships on the ocean, rivers, and lakes.</p>
<p>The government, pressured by public opinion, repeatedly attempted to curb the continued development of Rockefeller's business. Therefore, the court issued an order to dissolve the Standard Oil Trust. However, Rockefeller continued to operate the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and its hundreds of branches as before. Rockefeller's financial power had indeed dominated the world. Therefore, the late President Roosevelt strongly disliked him, repeatedly denouncing him. Some say that Roosevelt knew Rockefeller, but Rockefeller did not know Roosevelt. To have already ascended to the highest position in the country, and still despise wealth, to be willing to create great enterprises by hand, and not to be willing to seek profit, to firmly oppose the accumulation of wealth in one person, and not to bear to increase the cost of living for ordinary people who earn meager wages, his aspirations were certainly not trivial. Why could Rockefeller not see this?</p>
<p>Rockefeller and his Standard Oil Company faced attacks unprecedented in history. Writers constantly published articles in magazines and books to defame him, and his competitors accused him of using the power of money to overwhelm competition, even employing private individuals to spy on the internal affairs of competing companies. Rockefeller at this time almost had a reputation for being rich but unkind. However, Rockefeller and his partners persisted in their established policies, ignoring the slander and silently operating their business. Rockefeller and others were repeatedly summoned to courts and congressional committees for reprimands, but they always managed to defend themselves successfully. One of the most notable cases was in 1907, when Rockefeller was summoned to court in Chicago to testify, and the Indiana Standard Oil Company was subsequently fined $20,000 for each of the 1,462 charges against it. However, this was later overturned by the Supreme Court, so the fine was never paid.</p>
<p>In 1911, the Supreme Court enforced the Sherman Antitrust Act and ordered the dissolution of the Standard Oil Trust. However, the development of the resulting parts was even greater than when they were directly controlled by one entity. In the fifteen years before the dissolution of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, Rockefeller had not gone to the office every day, but still held the title of General Manager of the company until its dissolution.</p>
<p>In September 1864, Rockefeller married the daughter of a merchant from Akron, Ohio. The lady was a classmate from Cleveland High School in 1835. The couple lived an ideal life together for nearly fifty-one years. Rockefeller usually did not participate much in social activities, except to entertain family and friends. He always focused on educating his children and engaged in church and Sunday school work and various charitable endeavors. The lady passed away in March 1915 due to heart disease. For several years, the lady was unable to attend church in person, so her husband would excerpt the bishop's sermons and relay them to her. The Rockefellers had five children, one of whom died in infancy. The remaining three were daughters and one son. All three daughters married, but the youngest daughter passed away many years ago.</p>
<p>By middle age, Rockefeller had accumulated half of the wealth that was rarely seen by individuals in world history. At the age of fifty-seven, he stopped participating in business affairs and devoted himself to distributing his wealth. In the thirty-five years that followed, he gave away more than $500 million. A colleague once said that on the day Rockefeller passed away, the world would be surprised to find that his assets were relatively small. The exact amount of Rockefeller's assets has been a subject of public speculation for many years, but the actual figure has never been disclosed. Some say it was as high as $220 million, but those close to Rockefeller say it was far below that number. Rockefeller's son once said that it never even reached $100 million. However, for many years, Rockefeller was the top taxpayer in New York City, paying over $1 million annually. In his charitable work, Rockefeller wanted to solve the difficult problem of distributing wealth without making the recipients dependent on it for life. Therefore, he gathered experienced advisors and established charitable organizations, the most prominent of which were the Rockefeller Foundation, the General Education Board, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, and the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Fund. Rockefeller once explained his purpose, saying, "I personally planned it to the point of exhaustion. I could not find a thorough method for obtaining a clear approach in the vast scope of charitable work without sufficient guidance. I had no choice but to organize this group. The path it takes to proceed is like the way we manage other things. I hope I can help improve the efficiency of wealth distribution, so that assets can be used to a greater extent in this generation and future generations. If we can teach people to help themselves, then we can eliminate the root of many evils in the world."</p>
<p>In distributing his wealth, Rockefeller did not seek speed but rather appropriateness. When he first donated $100,000 to the University of Chicago, he first assessed the urgency of the school's needs before giving it. Seeing the development of the school, he then gradually subsidized it. He donated a total of $35 million to the school over a period of twenty years. It was the same for other undertakings. Rockefeller once said, "One of the most important elements that can promote civilization is the progress of morality and religion." Rockefeller owned a mansion on the hill of Pocantico, overlooking the Hudson River. Rockefeller was meticulous, loved golf, attended church regularly, and always got up at six every morning. Even when he was over eighty years old, he was still as vigorous as a young man, with a smile on his face, fond of humor, and diligent in making a fortune, not neglecting even the smallest details. He despised all forms of gambling. Rockefeller never engaged in speculative activities in the securities market. He was not only persistent in his work but also always cautious. He walked calmly, spoke slowly, did not say much, but always hit the mark. When he played golf at the age of eighty-three, he was still strong as ever. Throughout his life, he paid close attention to the happiness of children. His most important motto in life was "There can be no happy life without work." He disliked publicity by nature. News reporters who wanted to obtain information from him would be rebuffed.</p>
<p>One day, Rockefeller was playing golf on Pocantico Hills when a news photographer climbed over a fifteen-foot-high wall and approached him with a camera. Rockefeller asked him how he had entered. The photographer hesitated for a moment and pointed to the wall. Rockefeller then said, "Since you came in this way, you can leave this way too." But he still allowed the photographer to take his picture and then watched him climb over the wall and leave.</p>
<p>Rockefeller celebrated his ninety-seventh birthday in July 1936, still holding a large family banquet as he had done for the past twenty-five years. Many descendants attended. (Reuters)</p>
<h3>Rockefeller's Aphorisms</h3>
<p>A few of Rockefeller's aphorisms are listed below:</p>
<p>"Strive to do all the good you can, and do not be afraid of work."</p>
<p>"In my opinion, there is no feeling in the world that can compare with self-reliance. Do not sacrifice self-reliance for other things."</p>
<p>"Do not become decadent before you are old, and maintain an interest in life and all living things."</p>
<p>"Do not live beyond your income. To my knowledge, the fastest path to ruin is for young people to go into debt as soon as they enter society."</p>
<p>"First, find someone who can do a job, and once you have found them, let them do it without hindering them. I feel that this is the true economy of life."</p>

<p>⊙Rebel Camps Outside Bilbao: Today, 4,000 rebel troops are pressing closer, having surrounded approximately 2,500 Basque army columns in the foothills of Mount Azobia, south of Bilbao. General Mola, the rebel commander, stated that it would be difficult for the government troops to break through the encirclement, as they are surrounded by artillery and machine guns, and their retreat route has been cut off. At the same time, another rebel column is directly attacking Bilbao. An Associated Press reporter witnessed rebel troops advancing along mountain paths, each wearing a white cross on their backs to avoid being mistakenly bombed by aircraft. General Mola's vanguard has now reached Lemoa, only five miles from Bilbao, and is about to come into contact with the government's final defense line. (23rd, National Telegram)</p>

<p>President Lebrun Presides Over Ceremony - Forty-Two Countries Participating</p>
<p>[Paris] The 1937 Paris Exhibition was officially opened today by French President Lebrun. When the President arrived at the venue, a 101-gun salute was fired. Although the official opening was today, many exhibition halls are not yet ready, and some will not be open to the public for another month. The preparations were delayed due to political and labor strike issues. The issue of recruiting British workers to come to Paris to work in the British exhibition hall is currently under discussion. The original exhibition plan has been expanded several times, and there are now a total of 280 exhibition venues. This is also one of the reasons for the delayed preparations. There are currently 42 foreign countries participating in this exhibition. (Central News Agency, 24th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Japanese Political and Civilian Parties Actively Working to Overthrow Cabinet</h3>
<p>Young Members Brewing a Permanent Movement - Planning to Concretely Realize the Common Policies of Both Parties</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The movement of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, aimed at overthrowing the Hayashi Cabinet, has now begun its concrete first step. However, among the young members of both parties, a new movement is brewing, believing that the goal of the alliance should not be solely to overthrow the Hayashi Cabinet but should be an active and permanent movement. In other words, instead of making the overthrow of the Hayashi Cabinet the entire goal of the movement, they advocate establishing concrete countermeasures to stabilize national life, countermeasures to high prices, and the concretization of so-called policies to renew the general administration in the process of the overthrow movement. Under the common policies of the political and civilian parties, unite the anti-government nationals, regardless of who obtains the future regime, we should emphasize the above policies as the urgent tasks of the present, and advance with the close cooperation of the two parties under the full support of the people. Only in this way can the great objectives of excessively implementing temporary policies, overthrowing the Hayashi Cabinet, and stabilizing the current situation be achieved. For this purpose, the two parties have recently shown active momentum. Therefore, as the alliance movement progresses, the results are worth noting. (24th, Domei News Agency)</p>

<h3>Japanese Mail Steamship Company Dispute Arises Again</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) had a dispute with the Meirokai, an organization of its senior staff. Regarding the settlement, 46 employees were suspended at the time. At the same time, the goal was to remove the two directors, Uratada, head of the Maritime Affairs Department, and Asanaka, head of the Engineering Department, from their concurrent positions as department heads, so further unrest occurred. Fifteen people working at the Tokyo head office of the Uratada faction, ten including Fukase, deputy supervisor of the Kobe branch, and seven from the Yokohama branch, totaling thirty-two people, submitted their resignations several days ago. Before the general meeting to be held on the 26th of this month, the company is extremely flustered by internal and external attacks. If the influence extends to the Staff Association, it will be even more unmanageable, so they are trying to cope with the situation as best as they can. (24th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>Baldwin to Submit Resignation This Friday - Chancellor Chamberlain to Succeed as Prime Minister</p>
<p>[London] This week is Prime Minister Baldwin's last week of service in the House of Commons. Baldwin has been a member of the House of Commons for nearly thirty years since 1908. This Friday, Baldwin will first go to the House of Commons and then drive to Buckingham Palace to submit his resignation to the King and recommend the current Chancellor Chamberlain to form a new cabinet. After being ordered, Chamberlain will immediately enter the palace to receive the order to form a cabinet. It is said that Baldwin and his successor have had long discussions on the selection of the new cabinet members, and the reorganization procedures should be completed soon. It is generally believed that the large-scale changes in the cabinet may not affect the implementation of national policies. However, there will be slight changes at the end of the year. It is also rumored that after Baldwin resigns, the King will grant him the title of Earl and allow him to sit in the House of Lords. His son, Oliver, who is a member of the Labour Party, will also be granted the title of Viscount. It is also rumored that Simon, the current Home Secretary, will succeed Chamberlain as Chancellor, while Wood, the Minister of Health, is likely to be transferred to Home Secretary. Furthermore, Lord Halifax, the Lord Privy Seal, will succeed MacDonald as Lord President of the Council, and Sir Inskip, the Minister of Commerce, will succeed Halifax as Lord Privy Seal. There will be no major changes to the Foreign Secretary. (Central News Agency, 24th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang Arrives in Tai'an from Beijing</h3>
<p>To preside over the state funeral ceremony for martyrs in Luozhou; plans to stay in Feng for six or seven days before returning to Beijing.</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Central Government, in commemoration of the fourteen martyrs including Shi Congyun and Wang Jinming who died in the Xinhai Luozhou Uprising, will hold state funeral ceremonies at the Martyrs' Shrine Memorial Stele in Mount Tai and the Memorial Tower of the Clothing and Hat Tomb in Hot Springs, Beiping, on the 26th of this month. Feng Yuxiang was appointed as the Central Government representative and Han Fuju as the National Government representative to attend the state funeral ceremony in the Mount Tai area. Lu Zhonglin and Shi Jingting were appointed as the Central Government representatives, and Song Zheyuan as the National Government representative to attend the state funeral ceremony in the Hot Springs, Beiping area. Lu and Shi had already gone to Beiping, and Song Zheyuan will also return to Beiping from Leling within days to preside over all matters. Feng Yuxiang, in order to attend the state funeral ceremony in the Tai'an area, took a special train north from Beijing at 4:00 PM on the 22nd, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Li Dequan, and their children, as well as Qiu Shan Ning, Wang Shiqing, and other members of the Military Affairs Commission. There were also dozens of guards accompanying the train for protection. The train passed Teng County at about 5:00 AM on the 23rd and arrived in Yanzhou at about 7:00 AM. Sun Tongxuan, the commander of the 20th Division stationed there, County Magistrate Zhou Tong, and others came to the station to welcome him. Feng got off the train to meet Sun and others and talked for more than ten minutes before getting back on the original train and continuing north. He arrived in Tai'an at 10:35 AM. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life rushed to the station to welcome him, including Zhou Baihuang, the magistrate of Tai'an County, An Linlai, the director of the Orphanage, government officials from various agencies, the police bureau, the garrison troops, students, and more than a thousand people. After getting off the train, Feng nodded to the welcoming crowd to express his gratitude. Feng was wearing a short blue coarse cloth coat, a blue coarse cloth sash, cloth leggings tied around his trousers, black cloth shoes, and an old white cloth hat. His face was full and plump, and he looked even stronger than he did two or three years ago. After exchanging greetings with the welcoming crowd, Feng took a sedan chair directly to Wangzhuang at the foot of Mount Tai. After arriving at Wangzhuang, he did not rest but immediately visited the calligraphy and painting, then went to the specimen room and physics and chemistry instrument room to inspect everything and inquire about the management situation. He then went to the art gallery for a look before having lunch and resting. It is said that Han Fuju is scheduled to arrive in Tai on the 25th or 26th to pay his respects to Feng and attend the inauguration ceremony of the Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine. Wen Chenglie, a senior advisor to the Provincial Government, Deng Zhexi, the President of the Hebei Provincial High Court, and Li Xin, the director of the Provincial Committee and concurrently the director of the Security Office, are scheduled to take a train from Jinan to Tai'an at 5:45 AM on the 24th to pay their respects and plan to take a train back to Jinan that evening. The following is a record of Feng's remarks in Tai: "The Central Government believes that the fourteen revolutionary martyrs including Wang Jinming and Shi Congyun who died in the Qizhou Uprising died heroically and their contributions are to the country, so it has decided to hold a state funeral ceremony on the 26th of this month. The Clothing and Hat Tomb and Memorial Tower in Hot Springs, Xishan, Beiping, will also hold their inauguration ceremony on the same day. Furthermore, considering that most of the martyrs were from Shandong, in order to leave a memorial in Shandong, a Martyrs' Shrine was built in Mount Tai, and a memorial stele was erected in front of the Martyrs' Shrine, and a memorial forest was planted. The state funeral ceremonies will be held on the same day in Beiping and Tai'an. The Central Government has sent Lu Zhonglin and Shi Jingting as representatives, and the National Government has sent Song Zheyuan as a representative, to attend the state funeral ceremony in Beiping. The Central Government has also sent me (Feng referred to himself) as a representative, and the National Government has sent Han Fuju as a representative, to attend the state funeral ceremony in Tai'an. Now that the date for the state funeral ceremony is approaching, I have come to Tai'an from Beijing to attend." When asked whether he would go to Jinan after the state funeral ceremony was over, whether he still often went to the Army University to study in Beijing, and the recent situation of rumors in Sichuan, Feng replied, "I plan to stay in Tai for six or seven days and return to Beijing after attending the state funeral ceremony. I do not plan to go to Jinan. In the past, I regularly attended lectures at the Army University every week in Beijing. After returning from Chaoxian County, I was interrupted due to busy official duties. As for the rumors in Sichuan, they are purely unfounded and will soon be eliminated and are not a matter of overall importance."</p>
<h3>Haiyuan Wheel Runs Aground Outside the Pearl River Estuary</h3>
<p>More than two hundred passengers were rescued and survived; the bottom of the ship was pierced and all goods and luggage were lost.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyuan Wheel, which came south from Shanghai this time, arrived in Hong Kong on the 20th in the morning. It was originally scheduled to sail from Hong Kong to Guangzhou at 4:00 PM on the 20th, and it was estimated that it would arrive in Guangzhou that evening. However, the ship had to postpone the time to 4:00 AM on the 21st due to loading and unloading cargo in Hong Kong. When it left Hong Kong, the weather was calm and the waves were calm, but when it sailed to the sea near Jishuidou Lighthouse Island outside the port, it suddenly ran aground, and a part of the bow sank into the water. Passengers and crew members were safely returned to Hong Kong thanks to the rescue by the Taikoo Company's ship Yunnan, but the goods and passengers' luggage were all flooded in the ship and suffered heavy losses. According to the survivors, when the Haiyuan Wheel sailed to the sea near Jishuidou, the sea surface there was narrow, no more than a quarter of a mile wide, and ships traveled frequently. When the Haiyuan Wheel sailed into the area at 4:30, dawn was breaking. In the misty fog, a small steamer was spotted ahead, towing several fishing boats, crossing the sea surface. The Haiyuan Wheel's helmsman, fearing a direct collision, slowed down near the shore of Lighthouse Island. Unfortunately, the tide was rising rapidly and the ship was hit and ran aground on a reef about 100 yards from the shore. With a loud bang, the passengers were awakened from their sleep and looked at each other in dismay. The captain, Zhong Nichen (British), urgently ordered the crew and workers to rescue the damaged area, and advised the passengers not to panic, and reported the accident to the Hong Kong Marine Police Department and the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company by radio. At the same time, he sounded a distress whistle, hoping that nearby ships would come to rescue. Before long, the first and second passenger cabins in the bow were difficult to repair due to the holes pierced by the stalagmites. The sea water poured in and the right side of the ship gradually tilted and sank into the water. More than 170 passengers and 42 teachers and staff members of the Overseas Chinese School Teachers' Training Institute climbed onto the deck to wait for rescue in a state of extreme distress. Among them, women and children cried for help, which was especially tragic. The captain immediately distributed life jackets to the passengers and unloaded four lifeboats on the ship to prepare everything. Fortunately, the Taikoo Company's ship Yunnan was sailing out of Jishui Gate from Guangzhou and heard the distress whistle from afar, knowing that a ship was in distress ahead. It quickly sailed closer to rescue the stranded passengers, and lowered the lifeboats to ferry the passengers to the ship. The refugees were transported to the Yunnan in batches by the lifeboats. At that time, the tide was turbulent and the five lifeboats shuttled back and forth eight times to rescue more than 200 passengers and some of the crew members and transport them back to Hong Kong on the Yunnan. The captain, Zhong Nichen, still led some of the crew members to work on the Haiyuan Wheel. Because the Haiyuan Wheel was tilted into the water on the starboard side after running aground, about ten feet long, and the two cabins in the bow were also submerged, only the stern was exposed. Moreover, the bottom of the ship was pierced and trapped by stalagmites, which could not be repaired until the tide rose and the ship floated. It is said that all the cargo in the passenger and cargo cabins were flooded, mostly rice and stones. The passengers who escaped from the disaster were sent to Hong Kong by the Yunnan, and most of them escaped alone. They immediately convened a meeting and resolved four requirements to be submitted to the Hong Kong China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: ㊀ The company must quickly recover everyone's luggage, ㊁ The company must select a location for everyone to rest and stay, ㊂ Compensate the passengers for the loss of luggage, ㊃ Find a way to send the passengers to Guangzhou as soon as possible. The Hong Kong China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's staff immediately admitted to doing so. As for the teachers and staff members of the Overseas Chinese School Teachers' Training Institute, Guangzhou sent staff to take care of them. They changed to a night boat to Guangdong on the 11th and arrived safely in Guangzhou on the morning of the 22nd. The Haiyuan Wheel was built in a British shipyard two years ago with a displacement of 3,400 tons. This time, it carried about 1,350 tons of cargo and more than 210 passengers and 140 crew members on its way south from Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Business Tax Dispute in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>A glimpse of the business community's work stoppage to protest taxes; the provincial government has newly revised tax payment methods.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Since the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance reorganized the business tax throughout the province last year, the results have been very good. Only recently, some businessmen in the provincial capital misunderstood the laws and believed that the tax amount had increased compared with the previous year, and refused to pay. They suddenly stopped business on the morning of the 14th, demanding a reduction in the tax amount. However, small and medium-sized businesses opened their doors as usual. Later, after mediation by Chen Zhaoying, the Zhejiang and Fujian Surveillance Commissioner, they resumed business the next afternoon. The order remained as usual during the period of work stoppage. The details of the process are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Initial Situation</p>
<p>The Fujian Ordinary Business Tax has been implemented since the abolition of the Lilin in the 20th year of the Republic of China. It has been six years. However, due to the hasty start at that time, the regulations were lacking. Only the situation in each county was used to allocate quotas. Each county either contracted out the quotas or asked business gangs to pay, or still collected Lilin-style transit taxes, arbitrarily apportioning them with little success. It initially had more than 1.9 million, which dropped to less than one million in the 25th year. Moreover, since the Fujian Incident until last year, the provincial government abolished more than 3 million in harsh and miscellaneous taxes one after another, and the provincial treasury was greatly depleted. Therefore, it had to reorganize taxes. Therefore, in March of last year, in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's Business Tax Law, it formulated collection regulations and formulated an outline of the reorganization plan, and assigned personnel to investigate and assess the tax amount in each county and collect taxes according to the register. All previous methods were removed. This is the way that those who seek to govern should take.</p>
<p>Reorganization Process</p>
<p>The past situation of business tax in the provincial capital was complicated. It was previously paid by the industry associations. In January of this year, the Department of Finance ordered the bureau to investigate and assess the tax amount and compile a register, which was completed in March. There are more than 12,000 businesses in the city, of which more than 8,000 pay taxes and more than 3,700 are exempt. Notices were sent separately, and since the collection began on May 1, it has also been smooth. On the 14th, some businesses stopped business to protest the increase in the amount, and the government said it would not change it, and the dispute arose. It was found that the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce requested: ㊀ Please collect half of the tax amount according to the special investigation tax amount, ㊁ Those who have paid special business tax should be exempt from ordinary business tax, ㊂ There are many errors in the investigation, please ask the tax bureau and the chamber of commerce to send one person each to review, ㊃ For businesses that operate several types of businesses with different tax rates, please levy taxes separately, ㊄ The capital amount of the business should be calculated according to the actual capital, ㊅ For those whose capital amount is less than 500 yuan, regardless of the business amount, they should be allowed to be exempt from business tax, and those whose business amount is less than 1,000 yuan, regardless of the capital amount, should also be exempt from tax. Later, the provincial government determined the solution: ㊀ This year, each industry in the provincial capital is temporarily allowed to reduce the tax by one-tenth of the special investigation register, ㊁ Those who directly pay special business tax, regarding the business amount of goods on which special business tax has been paid, shall be exempt from ordinary business tax before the special business tax is reduced or exempted, ㊂ Regardless of whether the tax is levied based on the business amount or the capital amount, it shall be handled in accordance with the regulations. As for the adjustment and drying errors, they are allowed to be verified and reviewed, ㊃ Businesses that operate several types of businesses with different tax rates, if there are special circumstances, shall be allowed to change to separate taxation after verification, ㊄ Those whose capital amount is less than 500 yuan shall be exempt from tax regardless of their business. There is no need to discuss the matter of those who carry burdens on their shoulders, and they are allowed to be exempt from business tax. Since the methods were issued, the opinions of both parties were close, and the business tax problem was thus resolved.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Preventing the theft and sale of ancient stele stone carvings</p>
<p>The Construction Bureau is already bidding for the widening of the main roads in the urban area and the reconstruction of the Xu Pan Lou Feng and other city gates, and the bidding is scheduled to open on June 5. A citizen, Xu Woyun, and others believe that the stone materials of the Yuecheng (i.e., the outer city) outside the city gates of Xu Pan and others were built with folk stele stones requisitioned during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. There are many ancient steles and ancient posts, such as Liang Lei stone carvings, etc. Therefore, on the 24th, they sent a letter to the Ancient Relics Preservation Committee requesting the Construction Bureau that once they are discovered during the reconstruction, they should transfer the valuable ancient stele stone carvings to the library for preservation, so as to facilitate scholars' research and prevent them from being stolen and sold by the contractors, resulting in the loss of ancient relics.</p>
<p>Silk Industry Representatives Petition</p>
<p>The Wuxian Yarn and Satin Industry and Iron Machine Silk Weaving Industry Association, because the import tax rate of rayon is more than twice the import tax rate of rayon woven products, jointly petitioned the central government with representatives of the silk industry from various places in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Representatives from various places are scheduled to gather at the Central Hotel in Nanjing on the 26th and go to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Finance on the morning of the 27th to petition, demanding that the tax be changed to ad valorem. Deng Gengxin and Yu Wenqing, the representatives of Wuxian, are scheduled to go to Beijing on the 25th.</p>

<p>In recent years, the silkworm affairs in the southwest townships of this county have been guided by the Guidance Institute, and 70% to 80% have been changed to breeding improved varieties. The weather has been mild this year, and the silkworm affairs have progressed well. The early crop has now been placed on the cocoon frame and is expected to harvest more than 3,000 dan of fresh cocoons this year, most of which can be completed by the end of this month. The cocoon merchants in various townships are scheduled to open the market and start weighing on the 2nd and 3rd of next month. This spring, because more cocoons have been collected, the number of registered cocoon merchants has increased by four compared with previous years. The cocoon price has been tentatively set at 40 yuan per dan by the improved area.</p>
<p>Conflict Between Poor People and Tax Police</p>
<p>At the mouth of Hupu, the yellow croaker season is currently on the market. However, after each fishing boat unloads its fish cargo, there is a large amount of salt brine left in the boat. Many poor people in the countryside often carry buckets and utensils to load it, as a seasoning or as fertilizer in the fields. However, the tax police stationed in the township believe that the villagers' acquisition of this salt brine is related to the sales of official salt and must be prohibited. Therefore, after each boat unloads its cargo, they forcibly order the brine to be poured into the sea. A few days ago, some poor people collected salt brine and went home, but they were seen by the tax police who forcibly poured it away. As a result, more than a thousand poor people (mostly women and old women) who depended on it for a living gathered at the mouth of the sea and had a dispute with the tax police. Although the police team used guns to disperse them, the women and others insisted on not leaving. It seems that their purpose is to get the tax police to accommodate the collection of salt brine. The fish merchants are currently mediating.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Mulberry Leaves Soar Unabated</p>
<p>Most of the early silkworm crops in this county have been placed on the cocoon frame. The number of cocoon merchants registered in various townships is unusually high, estimated at 3,700 to 3,800. However, according to the regulations of the Silkworm Industry Improvement Association, it is 3,030, exceeding the quota by 500 to 600. Currently, the cocoon merchants' association has tried to reduce the number of reported stoves to facilitate adjustment. The opening date is expected to be in early June. However, the number of breeding households this year has increased by one-third compared with previous years, so the price of mulberry leaves has been rising recently, nearly 2 yuan per piece, and 5 yuan per dan of leaf pieces. In the future, breeding households will inevitably lose money. Breeding households in Zhouxin Town, Beiantou, Xuxiangshang, Gu Daoli, Xiaoyuanli, Hedong Village, and other places have discarded the silkworms that have undergone the large sleep in the fields because they cannot afford to buy mulberry. In addition, the silkworms in Southern Spring Renzigang and other places in the Second District are of excellent quality, but the supply of mulberry leaves cannot meet the demand, and farmers are extremely worried. In addition, the local varieties of silkworms in Yuqi, Qianzhou, Beiqifang, Fuzhou Village, and other places in the Ninth District have been placed on the cocoon frame, and the improved varieties are opening their leaves after the large sleep and are progressing well. However, due to the high cost, it is feared that there will be no profit to be made.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Electric Pole Worker Dies</p>
<p>Ma Chuyun, a craftsman from Huaming Electric Light Company, was replacing an electric pole on West Heng Street at 7:00 AM on the 22nd when he suddenly touched a power line and was electrocuted to death. Another craftsman, Wu Guicai, was injured in the back and was treated at Jiangyin Hospital. The deceased has two sons. The company compensated him with 300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Famous Soil Trafficker Arrested</p>
<p>Jiang Lantian, a famous soil trafficker from Wuyi, has been sentenced to twelve years in prison by the county government. Wu Jinfa, an accomplice of Jiang, is from Xinfeng Town (i.e., the younger brother of Wu Jinhai, the driver of the train station). On the morning of the 22nd, he transported soil from Shanghai to Changzhou. He originally bought a ticket to Changzhou Station, but when he learned that someone was watching him, he got off at Xinzha Station. The person watching him reported to the stationmaster of that station, who sent police to search him. Five pairs of opium were found in Wu Jinfa's suitcase, weighing more than 60 taels. He was immediately transferred to the competent authority for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Principal Drowns While Watching a Festival</p>
<p>In this county's urban and rural areas, there is a custom of welcoming gods and holding festivals in early summer every year. Ordinary foolish couples are crazy about it, spending tens of thousands of dollars and harming the people. This is the worst thing. On the 20th of this month, there was a grand festival day and night in Shuangfeng Town. Li Houshu, the principal of the Fifth District Central Civil School, specially went to watch the festival on a bicycle. After watching the day festival, he also watched the night festival. After the festival, it was already about 3:00 AM on the 21st. Li had to go to drill at 4:30, so he rode back on the original car. When he passed the East Corner Bridge, the bridge was high and the river was wide, and there was a small turn. The night was dim and he was flustered and confused. The person and the car fell into the river. Although there were villagers on the same road, the river was wide and the water was deep, and there was no way to rescue him. They witnessed the tragic death. Later, the school received the news and hired a boat to salvage and transport it back. The vacancy left by the principal was temporarily filled by Lu Yunshi, the principal of Yue Wang School, by the Education Bureau.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Temporary Business Market Opens</p>
<p>The construction of the temporary business market on the river has been completed and the opening ceremony was held on the 22nd, which was very lively. More than 100 businesses moved in that day. Although the market is only built of reed mats and foreign pine, the arrangement of each business is quite appropriate. At the entrance are two three-dimensional cement gates. The sidewalks in the market are wide and flat, and the pavement is very neat. Behind the market, there is a large auditorium built on the open space facing the river.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Deadline for Labor Service Completion in Each District</p>
<p>The Jiangdu County Government, in order to determine how to punish those who should be punished for failing to meet the deadline for the completion of labor service in each district, specially proposed to discuss and determine the methods at this district chief meeting. It was decided that the rural districts should be completed by the end of May and accepted by the county. If the deadline is exceeded, the funds for the district, township, and town will be stopped. In the urban area, the education brigade's water car has been exhausted and is scheduled to start work on the 23rd and report completion in ten days. The citizen and merchant brigades are scheduled to start work on the 26th and report completion in ten days. Water trucks are jointly handled by the Construction Bureau in sections. If the deadline is still delayed, in addition to ordering the brigade leader to hand over the work, all the citizens, merchants, and town and bao chiefs will be brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Petition to Revoke Tax Rate</p>
<p>The oil, sesame, porcelain, cured meat, ham, eggs, silk, cloth, and other industries, as well as major merchants in Jiaxing, believe that the tax rate for goods leaving the province is usually the same as that for wholesale, which is one-half lighter than that for retail. It is now heard that the Zhejiang Provincial Business Tax Authority intends to increase the comparison, and there is a proposal to tax the goods leaving the province at the same rate as retail. If this is realized, commercial operations will inevitably become more difficult, and the prospect of tax revenue will also be reduced. Therefore, they jointly petitioned the county chamber of commerce to submit to the authorities, requesting the revocation of this proposal for the same taxation, so as to maintain commerce and benefit tax revenue.</p>
<h3>Leftovers from the Yunnan Journey (15)</h3>
<p>— A Cup of Tea</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I climbed to the Sanqing Pavilion on Xishan Mountain. The edge of the county cliff is winding into a passage. In front is the Yunnan land. Looking far beyond a hundred miles, it is slightly like the shape of Jiaoshan Mountain, and the line of sight is far and wide. It is truly a great view. The highest point is a stone room, and the Buddha is also carved from stone, and there is also a "Da Tian Pavilion", which is 2,100 meters above sea level. The Sanqing Pavilion is inhabited by feather scholars, and there are many inscriptions by tourists. After going down the mountain, I took a bath in the "Hot Spring" in Anning County, 40 kilometers away. Zhou Lao Bo, the deputy director-general (once a famous lawyer in Shanghai), engineer Wu Xuwu (who worked in the Ford factory in the United States for ten years), and I entered the "First Soup in the World". The water temperature is 45 degrees, which is more real than the water source of Tangshan in the south and more rudimentary in equipment than Tangshan in the north. Next to it is the villa of Lu Hanjun of the Provincial Committee, and there are also many hot spring hotels. In the evening, I entered the city. Court President Hu Jue hosted a banquet at the residence of Division Commander Hu Ying. The hall was hung with authentic works of Yi Bingshou, Wen Zhengming, Wang Wenzhi, and Kang Youwei, which were extremely valuable for copying.</p>
<p>Several of my colleagues will take the route through Hanoi, Vietnam, Lang Son, and Zhennanguan to Guilin to meet.</p>
<p>On the thirtieth day (May 4th) morning, some went to inspect water conservancy projects, and some went to Yiliang for a short railway trip. The Chu family and others took the "Michelin" to Hekou and will not return until tomorrow night. The French manager of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, Ba Du, said, "The Michelin" uses gasoline and twelve rubber wheels, and currently has only sixteen seats. It is planned to add two more sections next year, which can carry forty-five seats. This car travels 90 kilometers per hour, while the trains that run every day only travel 45 kilometers per hour. The road station houses are similar to the Zhengtai Road, which is full of French style. The bridge and culvert projects are more magnificent in the southern section, such as the Feiqiao Bridge. The northern section is very simple. I remember passing the "Du Mei Bridge" in Vietnam twenty years ago, which was a very impressive project. (It is found that Mr. Lin Mei was once the Governor of Vietnam and later the President of France who was assassinated). The two major sections of the road between Haiphong Lao Kaijian and Kunming Hekou were all the Du Mei policy of that year, so I remembered it.</p>
<p>Then I went to the Kunming Library. The library is limited by funds, and the management and equipment are not fully discussed. The Tongzhi Bureau is located on the right side of the library, and it is attached to Minglun Xueming, which has monthly lessons. It is a rare survival of the Qing Dynasty academy system in Kunming. On this day, it happened to be the day when the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs was on duty. The test questions included "On", "Lectures", "After Reading", "Fu", and "Poetry", divided into five categories. Those who are selected receive one or two yuan per month.</p>
<p>Fellow villagers from Jiang, Zhejiang, and Guangdong who were traveling in Yunnan set up banquets to entertain the fellow villagers in the delegation. Fellow villagers from Hunan went to Cai Songpo Shrine after the banquet to offer flowers.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I met Commander Yang Ruxuan. Yang is good at Peking Opera and the previous night's rehearsal of "Huarong Road" and Group Leader Chu Minyi's "Empty City Stratagem" both won the applause of the audience. Zheng Yuejun's Taijiquan, with his body movements like a goddess scattering flowers and soft skills, has indeed entered the realm of perfection. Then I went to the People's Education Center to see the calligraphy and painting film exhibition of Mr. He Sui, Mr. Zheng Yuejun, and Mr. Song Yihen. He's tile calligraphy and Tang Dynasty murals were praised by the public. He will go to Guangxi Yaoshan to investigate and take the road through Vietnam to the Guibian tomorrow. Some of the others will go to Vietnam and then to Gui, and most of the people, because our starting point is the highway, are embarrassed to take the road through Vietnam and are willing to endure the hardships of the Guizhou Mountains. It is scheduled to start the return journey on the morning of the 7th.</p>
<p>At the Shen hour, I talked with an old friend about Jianjiu tin mines, which are now divided into two parts, one part is privately mined, and the other part is jointly operated by government and merchants. It is estimated that there are more than 200,000 miners. As for the tin smelting plant, it is presided over by the government and operated in the name of a company. At present, the annual output of tin is directly exported to the United Kingdom, amounting to about 20 million yuan, and it no longer needs to be refined in Hong Kong. The miners' lives are very difficult, and all health and medical equipment have not yet been started. There are many American technicians in the tin smelting plant, and their treatment is very good. The machinery is still relatively new. As for the high-speed railway and the Gebi small railway (the track width between Gejiu Bise is 60 meters), due to the age is slightly longer and the repairs are not complete, it looks quite old. A gentleman also said that the copper mine in "Dongchuan" has a very rich capacity, but there is no large company to mine it, which is a pity. Because most of our country's auxiliary coins of copper blocks come from neighboring countries (Takeo Copper Mine), if Yunnan copper is used to mint coins, the profit will not overflow. In the future, the government seems to be able to set up a copper mining plant in Yunnan to mint coins, and the central and local governments will benefit from it.</p>

<h3>Two French Aviators on Their Fifth Flight to the East</h3>
<p>Reaching Tokyo within One Hundred Hours - First Prize of Three Thousand Pounds</p>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that the renowned French aviator, Mr. Doret, and Mr. Micheletti, departed from Paris by plane at 6:00 AM on Saturday, hoping to reach Tokyo within one hundred hours in order to win the prize of three thousand pounds offered by the French Air Ministry to the first person to succeed. They had already arrived in Hanoi at 2:00 PM today (the 24th) and will fly directly to Shanghai at night, expected to arrive around 11:00 PM. However, as of midnight last night, the French authorities in this city received a report that the plane had flown from Allahabad, India, to Hanoi, Vietnam, at 10:50 PM last night, so it did not come to Shanghai that night. It continued to fly to Hong Kong at midnight, which would take about four to five hours to reach. According to the planned itinerary, if it does not fly directly to Japan, it will only be able to reach Shanghai at 7:00 AM this morning. It is noted that the two attempted this in February of this year, flying to Vietnam, but failed. French aviators have made this flight four times before, with success always just out of reach. This is the fifth attempt by Mr. Doret and Mr. Micheletti, and it should be successful.</p>

<h3>Yan Jici Attending the World Cultural Conference</h3>
<p>Discussion to be Held in July - Scheduled to Go Abroad on the 29th</p>
<p>The 19th Conference of the World Association for Cultural Cooperation and the Second Joint Conference of National Cultural Associations are scheduled to be held in Paris, France, from July 5th to 28th. Our representatives are Li Shizeng of the World Association for Cultural Cooperation and Yan Jici, Director of the Physics Research Institute of the National Beiping Research Institute. Mr. Yan arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday and is scheduled to leave Shanghai for France on the French postal ship Ellamas on the 29th of this month. According to Mr. Yan, who was interviewed by a reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency yesterday, the World Association for Cultural Cooperation is an international cultural cooperation organization affiliated with the League of Nations and is based in Geneva. At the same time, the World Academy for Cultural Cooperation is established in Paris and is part of the Association's system. Because the French government provides special funding subsidies, it is located in Paris, and each country has a branch association. The conference is scheduled for July 5th to 28th. During this period, in addition to holding the 19th Conference of the Cultural Cooperation Association, the Second Joint Conference of National Associations will also be held. Both conferences will discuss issues related to world cultural undertakings, and representatives from various countries will report on their domestic cultural undertakings. The conference venue is located in the Royal Palace in Paris. After the conference, I will take the summer to visit Germany, Switzerland, and the Nordic countries, and return to Paris in November to attend the Paris Physics Council. The meeting was initiated by French physicists three years ago and I was also invited to participate. I will take advantage of this conference to make my first appearance and report on physics research work. I plan to spend two months in Paris, one month in England, and one month in the United States before returning to China. I will conduct inspections on scientific organizations and physics research in Europe and the United States, and visit experts and hold talks. According to Mr. Yan, he is a famous physicist in our country and discovered the theory of the transmission of ultraviolet rays through old-fashioned paper windows in our country, which is highly respected by the world physics community. When the reporter asked about this, he said that it was a joint research with friends and not his personal strength. Now, many foreign sanatoriums use our country's cotton paper as windows, and his words were very modest.</p>
<h3>The Preparatory Committee for the Southwest Frontier Held a Reception for Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Southwest Frontier Advancement Association held a banquet for journalists from various newspapers in the city and representatives of the southwestern ethnic minorities, Gao Yuzhu and Yu Jiecai, at the Zhengyi Society on the seventh floor of the Continental Commercial Center at 7:00 PM last night.

<h3>Discussing Promotion Methods for National Handicrafts</h3>
<p>Many Products Have Not Been Seen Before - Shanghai Will First Be Used for Display and Sales</p>
<p>In order to promote the export of handicrafts from various places, the China National Trade United Company took advantage of the opportunity of the National Handicrafts Exhibition held in Beijing. Deputy Manager Wang Xingyao and Office Director Hu Shicheng, along with Shi Sheng, an employee of the Shanghai China National Products Company, participated in the exhibition. Mr. Wang has already returned to Shanghai first. He told reporters yesterday morning that the exhibition displayed handicrafts from various provinces and cities across the country, which were extraordinarily exquisite. Representatives from various provinces and cities participated, so he took this opportunity to discuss promotion methods. A tea party was held in Beijing, inviting more than 30 representatives from various provinces and cities and representatives from the Ministry of Industry to talk and report on the purpose of the establishment of the United Company and the purpose of assisting in promotion, which was supported by the representatives. Mr. Hu is currently continuing to contact the representatives individually in Beijing, and he will come to Shanghai in three to five days to report and then go to Beijing to discuss promotion methods. Mr. Wang also said that many of the exhibits have not been seen before, such as the copper products from Yunnan, which are mostly decorations and artistic items such as antique bells and tripods. Fujian also has porcelain, with delicate texture and exquisite craftsmanship, and the price is especially cheap. The summer cloth of Wanzai, Jiangxi, has always been famous, and now it is more beautiful after being printed. Other items such as cotton and wool textiles from various places, as well as sweets, food, and toys from Beiping, can also be promoted. However, when mass production is carried out in the future, it is worthwhile to study the standardization of products, the improvement of patterns, and the reduction of costs. After the promotion methods are discussed and settled, it is planned to display and sell them in Shanghai first, and gradually promote them to various places. As for shipping them overseas or cooperating with merchants in various places, or setting up our own company, it depends on the situation.</p>
<h3>Chinese Banks Studying Methods to Reduce Interest Rates</h3>
<p>Submitted to the Guild's Group for Discussion - May Be Implemented from July 1st</p>
<p>Foreign banks in this port, such as HSBC, Citibank, and Mercantile Bank, have recently reduced interest rates by one percent per week in order to improve the market and reduce the burden on overdraft customers. This has caused quite a stir in the Chinese financial community in this city. According to a reporter from the Shenshi News Agency, this interest rate reduction method is of great benefit to industry and commerce. Chinese banks are now also studying it. Because the interest rates of various banks are usually quite inconsistent, ranging from 2% to 2.5%, it is currently agreed by all banks to submit it to the special research group of the Bankers Association for careful discussion, or to implement a unified method. However, for the convenience of calculating the entire year, it will be implemented from July 1st after discussion and decision.</p>

<h3>The Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association Telegraphs the Central Government to Stop the Indiscriminate Issuance of Auxiliary Currency Notes</h3>
<p>Enumerating Three Reasons Why It Should Be Prohibited - People Cannot Obtain Legal Tender</p>
<p>The Fujian Provincial Bank issued auxiliary currency notes, which did not comply with the quota set by the Ministry of Finance, and the issuance increased day by day. The Shanghai-based Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association telegraphed the Fujian Provincial Government and the Department of Finance, inquiring about the total amount of issuance and the amount of reserve funds. To date, several months have passed without a reply, and the people of Fujian are increasingly suspicious, inquiring about the truth with the Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association. The Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association believes that the matter concerns the financial affairs of their hometown and decided to submit a request to the central government and relevant departments to stop it immediately. The text of the telegraph is as follows: "We have investigated that Chen Yi, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, established a provincial bank to issue auxiliary currency notes, amounting to more than ten million yuan, which violates the legal tender and disrupts the financial system. This association has repeatedly received requests from the Shanghai Xing'an Guild Hall and various guild halls and public offices to thoroughly investigate the total amount of auxiliary currency notes issued by the Fujian Provincial Bank and the amount of reserve funds. If the amount of issuance can be unlimited without following laws and regulations, the abuses will inevitably repeat the disaster of the warlord Li Houji era in Fujian. It is also claimed that the huge issuance of these auxiliary currency notes has not been approved by the Ministry of Finance. This association decided on March 13th this year to telegraph the Fujian Department of Finance to inquire about the total amount of issuance and the amount of reserve funds. However, the department refused to reply, and the public's suspicion increased. This association again decided on April 18th to directly telegraph the Fujian Provincial Government, while again telegraphing the Department of Finance to urge a reply as soon as possible to appease public opinion and show great trust. However, a month has passed, and the Fujian Provincial Government has also refused to reply. It is impossible to guess what is going on behind the scenes. On May 9th, this association held its second plenary session, and it was agreed that Fujian Province is close to a strong neighbor, coveting it. It is necessary to strengthen efforts to stabilize people's livelihoods and cultivate the foundation of the country. If we violate the central government's laws and regulations, the future will be very dangerous. Therefore, it was decided to submit the past situation to the central government and relevant departments and order a stop to maintain the currency system and value people's livelihoods. The temporary measures for establishing provincial banks approved by the Central Political Conference stipulate that the issuance of auxiliary currency notes should have 60% cash reserves and 40% guarantee money, and the methods for depositing the money have also been clearly stipulated. However, when the Fujian Provincial Government submitted a request to establish a provincial bank, it was claimed that the capital was one million yuan, but the Fujian Provincial Government and the Department of Finance and Construction diverted the bank's funds, amounting to more than one million yuan. This means that not only is the capital exhausted, but the losses to the provincial treasury exceed several times the amount. The promotion of auxiliary currency is becoming increasingly worse, causing endless harm. It has been found that the provincial bank has six branch offices in addition to the head office and branch offices, forty-seven treasuries, eight special zones, and three exchange offices. Its measures to densely deploy the auxiliary currency note financial network in the province are directly a conspiracy to eliminate the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Legal Tender. Even throughout the province's markets, there is a phenomenon of bad money driving out good money, and people cannot exchange several yuan of central legal tender. This is the first reason why we should order a stop. In order to regulate rural finance, the central government determines the total amount of provincial currency based on the financial resources of each province. The Fujian Provincial Bank was expressly ordered to issue two million yuan, but the Fujian Provincial Government brazenly violated the law and issued more than ten million yuan. This is evidenced by the fact that the Shanghai Commercial Press and the Fujian Baicheng Printing Bureau undertook the printing of these auxiliary currency notes, and the paper and labor costs alone amounted to 200,000 yuan. The huge amount of notes shows that they are being printed and issued at will, with no restrictions at all. It is very much like the province is governing itself. This violation of the order and indiscriminate issuance should be ordered to stop. This is the second reason. In addition, Article 11 of the temporary measures for establishing provincial banks stipulates that the printing of auxiliary currency notes should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and undertaken by the Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. The amount of issuance should also be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. However, the Fujian authorities have arbitrarily commissioned commercial firms to undertake the printing, and the thickness of the paper varies greatly, the size of the paper is inconsistent, and the patterns and outlines differ by as much as one-tenth, clearly confusing the true and false, giving counterfeiters an opportunity, and scheming to shirk responsibility in the future. This unauthorized private production should be ordered to stop. This is the third reason. The above three points are obvious facts. The Fujian Provincial Government has not replied to the letters and telegrams sent by this association. There must be some unspeakable secrets. If it violates laws and regulations so indiscriminately, the financial situation in Fujian Province will inevitably become increasingly chaotic. If other provinces and cities follow suit, what will become of the future of the legal tender? This association is from Fujian and speaks for Fujian, with heartfelt concern and uneasiness. In addition to submitting reports separately, we especially urge you to consider the difficulties of the people, strengthen our country, and strictly order the relevant departments to thoroughly investigate according to law and order a stop to relieve the suffering of Fujian.</p>
<h3>Continued Reports on Shipwrecks</h3>
<p>Hai Yuan Can Be Salvaged Soon</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Yuan ship, which ran aground at Jishui Gate, has been there for four days. Yesterday, the company first received a telegram from Li Yunqu, stating that the mail and cargo from the second and fourth holds had been unloaded, the water-damaged cargo from the first and second holds had been mostly discarded into the sea, and the leaks in the first hold and coal bunker had been plugged. In the afternoon, they received another telegram from the port stating that due to improved weather, the salvage work was progressing effectively. The holes in the first and second holds were on the ship's outer hull, not on the bottom, and the holes were only a foot or so in size. Now, after the water-damaged cargo is removed, the holes can be patched and the water pumped out. It is expected to be out of danger within two days and towed to Hong Kong to the Taikoo Dockyard for major repairs. This time, the cargo loss from the Hai Yuan incident is greater than the damage to the ship itself.</p>
<p>Yu Shun Damages Pier</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yu Shun ship, which specializes in transporting artillery in the Northern Seas, was en route from Shanghai to Tianjin. When the ship arrived at the Zizhu Forest pier at 5:30 PM, it was entering from Tanggu and was guided to the Hai River by a Western pilot, Captain Caroft, from the Tianjin Pilot Association. Upon reaching the pier, the ship turned around as usual, but due to the pilot's negligence, the Yu Shun collided violently with the pier, causing significant damage. The Tianjin branch reported to Shanghai yesterday that the accident was solely due to the pilot's negligence and that all losses incurred have been submitted to the Pilot Association for negotiation.</p>
<p>Sheng Ping Still Not Salvaged</p>
<p>The Minxin Company's Sheng Ping ship, which ran aground off the coast of Taiwan, has been awaiting salvage for over twenty days since the appointment of a Jardine Matheson tugboat. Several towing attempts have failed. According to yesterday's telegram, the Sheng Ping ship has been towed away from its original grounding position. It is hoped it can be salvaged in about three or four days. The insurance companies estimate that the salvage costs and post-salvage repair costs will be around 100,000 yuan, plus over 100,000 yuan in losses due to the ship's downtime.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Announces Restrictions on Barge Berthing</h3>
<p>Iron Barge Owners, Please Note: Violations Will Result in Fines</p>
<p>Recently, collisions involving inbound and outbound ships have occurred frequently in Huangpu Port. Several incidents, such as the Mingxing and Changde ships colliding with iron barges and civilian boats, have taken place. The Jianghai Customs Harbor Master stated that these barges do not comply with the Customs' published regulations on barge berthing, which creates dangerous situations. Therefore, yesterday, a notice was issued to crack down on the berthing of iron barges. Further violations will be severely punished. The notice states: In accordance with Article 45 of the Shanghai Port Management Regulations for Vessels, the number and arrangement of barges and civilian boats alongside large ships must not obstruct the navigation of other ships in the port. To ensure that other barges and ships have free passage in the port, the number of vessels allowed to berth alongside a ship in each row is limited as follows: ⑴ Iron barges with a capacity of 100 tons or more: a maximum of two barges abreast per row. ⑵ Iron barges with a capacity of less than 100 tons: a maximum of three barges abreast per row. (Note) This regulation only applies to iron barges whose tonnage is clearly marked on both sides of the hull or superstructure in capital letters. ⑶ Chinese barges: a maximum of six barges abreast per row. No other vessels are allowed to berth outside the rows of vessels specified above. Any vessels found to be berthing in violation of these regulations will be subject to fines by this office. All ship merchants are hereby notified. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Luo Qinghua Visits Xu Kan Yesterday to Request Higher Import Tax on Foreign Silk</h3>
<p>Mass Purchases Made in the East, Only Valuing Accurately Can Help</p>
<p>The import tax rate on artificial silk in our country was originally set at 60% of the value, and the tax rate on finished artificial silk fabrics was set at 80% of the value. However, artificial silk is taxed by quantity, while finished silk fabrics are taxed by value. When the tax rate was originally set, each case of artificial silk was worth about 500 yuan, and the customs duty was about 290 yuan in national currency. In recent years, the value of artificial silk has fallen to around 150 yuan, while the tax remains at 290 yuan, which is almost equivalent to 200% of the value. On the other hand, imports of finished artificial silk fabrics are still taxed at 80% of the value, thus turning the meaning of protective tariffs on its head. As a result, foreign silk has been imported in huge quantities and sold at low prices. Recently, some unscrupulous Chinese people have even gone to Japan to purchase large quantities of foreign silk, causing foreign silk to flood the market. The domestic silk market has been severely impacted, and silk workers are about to lose their jobs. Since artificial silk is often mixed with native silk, the brisk sales of foreign silk also have a significant impact on the livelihoods of silk farmers. Silk industries in various regions are under severe threat and are in an uproar. They have nominated Luo Qinghua, chairman of the Silk Industry Association, to go to Nanjing to discuss countermeasures with the Ministry of Finance, the Customs Administration, and the National Tariff Commission. In addition to the Jianghai Customs already valuing the imported foreign silk accurately for taxation purposes as a stopgap measure, Luo also visited Xu Kan, Vice Minister of Finance, at the Central Bank at 5:00 PM yesterday to request a higher import tax rate on foreign silk and to have the customs value imported foreign silk based on domestic market prices for taxation purposes in order to provide relief and maintain the national industry. Xu was greatly moved upon hearing this and agreed to adopt it. According to Luo, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, among the machine industries in our country, the silk industry is already relatively satisfactory. Anything owned by foreigners can be manufactured by us. Since the loss of the Northeast, the domestic silk market has been shrinking, and there is already a sense of overproduction. However, unscrupulous merchants, greedy for temporary profits, are willing to be accomplices to the enemy, which is deeply regrettable. He will find other effective ways to awaken them.</p>
<h3>Wang Cheng Comes to Shanghai to Negotiate Investment in a Textile Mill</h3>
<p>Approximately 8 Million Yuan Needed, Silver Circle Generally Agrees in Principle</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government plans to establish a large-scale textile mill in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, to develop the national economy, utilize the cotton from the cotton-producing areas of Yuyao and Zhenhai, and facilitate transportation while reducing costs. The estimated total construction cost is approximately 8 million yuan. Wang Cheng, Director of the Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, came to Shanghai from Hangzhou the day before yesterday to discuss the funding issue and visited leaders of important banks in Shanghai to negotiate the organization of a lending syndicate to ensure that the plan could be realized as soon as possible. Currently, the banking community in Shanghai has generally expressed approval in principle for this investment in the textile mill. Detailed arrangements are still under discussion. Wang will return to Hangzhou within a day or two after the initial negotiations in Shanghai are successful and will return to Shanghai to continue discussions after drafting specific plans. In addition to spinning fine yarns of 16 to 32 counts, the mill plans to establish a cloth factory and a dyeing factory in the future.</p>

<h3>Central Government's Disaster Relief Bonds for Sichuan Received</h3>
<p>Sichuan Provincial Government Acknowledges That 1 Million Has Not Been Allocated, Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Association Urges Liu Xiang to Allocate</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Disaster Relief Committee has not yet received the 1 million yuan in disaster relief bonds for Sichuan Province allocated by the Central Government and converted into cash. The Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Association sent a telegram to inquire. They have now received a reply from the Provincial Disaster Relief Committee stating: "To the gentlemen of the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association, we acknowledge receipt of your telegram. The 714,300 yuan odd from the Central Government was remitted to Chengdu by the Farmers Bank of Beijing the day after we sent the telegram (17th), and it has now been remitted to various severely affected areas for distribution. As for the 1 million yuan pledged by the Sichuan Provincial Government, it has not yet been allocated. In addition to urging allocation locally, we hope you will also urge them to do so. Respectfully replied." After receiving the telegram, the Association immediately sent a telegram to Chairman Liu, stating: "To Chairman Liu Pucheng in Chengdu, we acknowledge receipt of the telegram (23rd) from the Sichuan Disaster Relief Committee stating that the 1 million yuan pledged by the Sichuan Provincial Government has not yet been allocated. In addition to urging allocation locally, we hope you will also urge them to do so. The Sichuan disaster is severe, and rapid relief and disaster aid are urgently needed to save the remaining lives of the victims.

All expenses were borne by the two gentlemen themselves. All gifts from relatives and friends, totaling 252 yuan in national currency, were donated to disaster relief to benefit the victims. We have sent this letter specifically for you to acknowledge receipt and forward the donation, and we hope you will publish this in the newspaper to acknowledge their generosity and encourage others to do the same."</p>
<h3>Charity Associations Request Donations to Relieve Drought in Shaanxi and Shanxi</h3>
<p>More Than One Million People Affected by the Disaster, Relief Is Urgently Needed</p>
<p>The drought in Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces is severe, compounded by banditry. The victims are desperately calling for relief. The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association has repeatedly received requests for relief from the authorities of the two provinces. In addition to sending personnel to the disaster areas for inspection, the Association sent letters to various sectors yesterday, requesting donations to provide relief. The two letters are recorded below:</p>
<p>Request for Relief in Shaanxi</p>
<p>Respected Sir, Shaanxi Province is inherently barren. In recent years, it has repeatedly suffered from soldiers and bandits, and this year it has been followed by drought. The vitality of the province has been greatly damaged, and the people are in dire straits. This Association has repeatedly received telegrams from the province and has sent personnel for inspection. The affected areas extend to 61 counties, and the number of people affected by the disaster exceeds one million. At this time of year, when the old harvest is gone and the new harvest is not yet in, the spring famine is severe. Relief is urgently needed. To recover from the devastation, we rely on the strength of the masses. We have long admired your charitable heart and compassion. We respectfully enclose a donation list and respectfully request that you consider the severity of the disaster in Shaanxi Province and the desperate need for help from the people of Shaanxi, and generously donate money and goods. We ask for your help as if we were parched land longing for rain.</p>
<p>Severe Disaster in Shanxi</p>
<p>Respected Sir, Shanxi Province has suffered from disasters for years, followed by the intrusion of communist bandits. The strength of the people has been depleted to the extreme. This year, severe drought has resulted in disaster, and spring planting is hopeless. The disaster area extends to 62 counties, and the number of disaster victims is nearly ten million. This Association has repeatedly received telegrams from the authorities of the province and has sent personnel for on-site inspection. The severity of the disaster is unbearable to hear. It is said that saving one life is better than building a seven-story pagoda. We have long admired your compassion and concern for others. We have enclosed a donation list and respectfully request that you consider the plight of the disaster victims in Shanxi Province and their desperate need for help, and join us in donating money and goods to be transferred to the disaster areas for emergency relief to save the people of Shanxi from fire and water and to restore vitality to the barren land. We pray for your help as if we were parched land longing for rain.</p>
<h3>Lu Bohong Reports Severe Disaster in Mi County</h3>
<p>Widespread Displacement and Population Reduction, Disaster Victims Survive on Stone Cakes</p>
<p>Lu Bohong, Director of the Henan Province Investigation and Relief of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, sent another letter to the Association yesterday reporting on the disaster situation in Mi County, which stated: "Recently, the Mi County Investigation and Relief Committee, after being appointed, immediately went to inspect the four rural areas of Mi County. They found that the cruelty of the disaster was even greater than what was reported in the newspapers. To give a brief account, dogs, cats, chickens, and pigs are no longer seen in the villages of Mi County. Tree leaves and tree bark have been completely stripped and eaten, and wild grass may become extinct. Bran porridge is the exclusive food of landlords, and stones are the food of common people. Those who could not bear the hunger and hanged themselves, drowned themselves, or died on the road can be seen everywhere. As for selling wives and daughters, prices are openly discussed. Young and slightly beautiful women are sold for 20 or 30 yuan, followed by 10 yuan or so, and even 4 or 5 yuan. A boy can be sold for six silver dollars. In this situation, even if the government has money to set up shelters, unless they provide compensation to the husband or parents, they will not willingly allow them to be taken in. Currently, the strong have mostly fled elsewhere, and those at home are mostly elderly and weak people waiting to die. Therefore, daily inspections of households reveal only three or four, one or two, or even none. The food for the people in the city is stone cake mixed with a little flour, one cake costing 100 copper coins. However, those who eat this cake can live for a maximum of three days. Wheat seedlings can only be seen in areas near water, and otherwise, not a single blade of grass grows." (Remainder omitted)</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Association recently received a telegram from a loan officer reporting that the disaster situation in Luoyang, Yichuan, Yiyang, Linru, and other places was extremely dire. The telegram stated: "To the Renji Hall Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association of Shanghai, after traveling from Luoyang to Yichuan, Yiyang, and Linru for inspection, the wheat has completely withered and turned into barren land everywhere. The elderly and children are fleeing on the road, their faces showing signs of death. Three or four out of ten disaster victims have fled. In Linru, the Lianbao population at the border of Fanfeng is 3,000, and 2,500 have fled. Several people are starving to death every day. Now, when they are exhausted and the plowing cattle are gone, even if it rains and they try to plant autumn crops, they will have to wait a hundred days for the harvest. In the Luoyang and Mengjin area, there has been very little rain, and autumn crops still cannot be planted. Tang Zong Guo Guofang bows in respect."</p>
<h3>Misinformation Regarding the Reorganization of the Ninety-Six</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that rumors regarding the reorganization of the Ninety-Six have been rampant for the past month, and that the Japanese side has sent representatives to the Ministry of Finance to request reorganization. When a reporter inquired about this matter to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance, it was said that Mr. Katsuji Uchida of Japan had recently visited Nanjing to meet with Vice Ministers Zou and Xu twice and was invited to a dinner by the two Vice Ministers. Mr. Uchida discussed this matter, and the two Vice Ministers informed him in detail of the various difficulties in reorganizing the Ninety-Six and that the Minister was far abroad and the matter was of great importance and could not be handled. Mr. Uchida understood this deeply, so the rumors regarding the reorganization of the Ninety-Six are unfounded and inaccurate.</p>

<h3>Drivers' Union Warns Members Not to Strike Without Authorization</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Automobile Drivers Occupational Union, to prevent unscrupulous individuals from taking the opportunity to incite labor unrest, has resolved to submit any cases of employers mistreating workers or violating labor contracts to the union in advance. The union will then negotiate and petition the Party and government agencies for mediation and await a resolution. Members are not allowed to take any unauthorized or excessive actions on their own.

<h3>Ministry of Communications Orders Telegraph Bureau to Rectify Telegraphic Transfers and Telegrams</h3>
<p>Directives Issued to Subordinates for Rapid Transmission</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications received an order from the Ministry stating that telegraphic transfers and telegrams are extremely important as they relate to the exchange of funds. Recently, it has been found that various bureaus have made errors in transmitting such telegrams, causing recipients to inquire back and forth and express dissatisfaction. This seriously hinders postal and remittance services and affects the credibility of telegrams. It is imperative to rectify the situation thoroughly. In the future, all bureaus must pay close attention to telegraphic transfers and telegrams during transmission. If there are any errors, they should be handled promptly upon the request of the sender or receiver for a retransmission and should not be delayed. You are hereby instructed to ensure compliance. After receiving the order, the bureau has instructed its subordinates to pay close attention.</p>

Those who attended included Chairman Ye Yuhu, Vice Chairmen Shen Xinqing, Chen Taoyi, Qin Yanqi, Directors Li Zuhan, Jia Jiying, Zhou Yueran, Wang Kunyi, Chen Ziyi, Zhu Kaichou, Hu Zhaochun, Xu Weinan, Chen Duanzhi, Wu Jingshan, Shen Qinlu, Lu Danlin, and collection directors and deputy directors from Shanghai City, Shanghai County, and Chuansha, Jiading, Songjiang, Nanhui, Suzhou, Jinshan, Fengxian, Nanjing, Baoshan, Qingpu, Hangzhou, and other places, including Wu Hufan, Yang Weiyu, Qin Bowei, Shen Xiangzhi, Chen Bokui, Yao Shizi, Liu Donghai, Xu Bangda, Zhang Bochou, and others, totaling over one hundred people. Ye Yuhu served as chairman.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the meeting was called to order, Chairman Ye Yuhu gave the following report: ⑴ Since the start of preparations (May 10th) until now, in just two weeks, not only have people from all nine counties convened meetings one after another to begin work, but also libraries in Suzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Beijing, and other places have also prepared to send exhibits, and other people from all walks of life and collectors from various places have also risen up to assist, which is highly commendable. ⑵ The scope of the exhibits, as previously decided by the preparatory conference, is limited to Shanghai City and the nine counties under the jurisdiction of the Third Administrative District of Jiangsu Province: Shanghai, Songjiang, Jinshan, Qingpu, Nanhui, Fengxian, Chuansha, Baoshan, and Jiading. However, recently, some people have advocated including Taicang County, and we do not know what opinions you have. ⑶ As a result of recent contacts with various parties, the items of books and maps are relatively organized. Items such as portraits of sages and historical materials are the most difficult to collect. We hope that everyone will consider all aspects when collecting exhibits. Also, to avoid duplication of exhibits from various places, if there are more exhibits related to books and maps, please send a list to the conference first, and then the conference will compare the lists sent from various places, verify them, and notify you separately. ⑷ Recently, some collectors have inquired whether the conference can be responsible for guaranteeing that the exhibits will not be damaged. The office has carefully designed the storage methods and procedures, and most of the exhibits will be displayed in cabinets during the exhibition, so there is nothing to worry about. We hope that everyone can be responsible for explaining this to the exhibitors when collecting exhibits. ⑸ The conference has a short amount of time and few staff members. The office staff can only work at the conference and cannot contact various parties widely. Therefore, we are holding a tea party today to invite everyone to report on the situation of the conference in the past two weeks and to ask you about important matters for the conference to proceed with in the future.</p>
<p>Work Report</p>
<p>Next, the collection directors from various cities and counties, Jiang Yinqiu (Suzhou), Zhao Junsheng (Baoshan), Qin Bowei (Shanghai County), Zhang Bochou (Chuansha), Zhang Hongnian, Yang Weiyu (Jiading), Yao Shizi (Jinshan), Chen Bokui (Fengxian), Xu Bangda (Shanghai City), and others successively reported on the collection work (other places such as Beijing, Nanjing, Hangzhou, etc. all had written reports, which are omitted). Then, Director Chen Duanzhi reported: ⑴ The conference regulations and registration forms have already been sent to the directors separately. The receipts are sent to the collection directors in various places. Some have been returned due to unknown addresses. If you have not received these printed materials, please notify the conference of your address so that we can resend them. ⑵ If the registration forms are not enough, you can request more. ⑶ The methods and procedures for filling out the registration forms and receipts. ⑷ The meaning of setting up an office and a receiving office. ⑸ We hope that the exhibits from various places will be sent to the conference before June 10th, and no later than June 20th. ⑹ To date, only the lists of collection committee members from Suzhou, Fengxian, Shanghai, Songjiang, and Hangzhou have been sent to the conference. We hope that other places will also send them as soon as possible for additional appointments.</p>
<p>Matters for Discussion</p>
<p>Then, Shen Xinqing, Yao Minghui, Ye Yuhu, and others expressed their opinions, followed by a discussion: ⑴ Proposal to include Taicang County for public decision. (Resolved) Passed, and Zhu Kaichou was elected as the collection director. ⑵ Proposal for all exhibits to be received and sent by the director. (Resolved) It is not stipulated that they can also be sent directly to the conference. ⑶ Proposal to limit the scope of exhibits to one city and ten counties. (Resolved) For paintings and calligraphy, even if they are not from the one city and ten counties, they must be accompanied by obvious inscriptions to be meaningful. ⑷ Proposal to send letters to Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, and Shishi Bao to solicit the earliest newspapers for inclusion in the exhibition. (Resolved) Passed and approved. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Detailed Account of Japanese Boy's False Report of Gunshot Wound</h3>
<p>Incident Caused by Playing with a Gun at a Friend's House, Tamura Toji Already Detained</p>
<p>The newspaper briefly reported yesterday on the case of the Japanese boy Komu Sadayoshi falsely reporting a gunshot wound. Further investigation reveals the following details: At 11:30 PM the day before yesterday, the Hongkou Police Station received a report from Komu Sadayoshi, a Japanese national at the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road, claiming that he had been shot in the left arm. The Chinese and Western detectives, accompanied by detectives from the Japanese Consulate, rushed to investigate. He stated that he lived at No. 240 Miller Road and that at noon on the 22nd, while walking with his friend Ryota Kinoshita, a Japanese national, a Westerner suddenly shot at him, hitting his left arm. He also stated that he would not pursue the matter. The Chinese and Western detectives suspected there was more to the story and asked him to tell the truth. They learned that there was a Tamura Toji, who was not under consular jurisdiction because he was of mixed Western descent, living at No. 37, Lane 173, Wuchang Road, who owned a handgun. He had gone to Tamura Toji's house with Kinoshita Ryota to look at the gun, and the gun had accidentally fired, causing the incident. The Chinese and Western detectives, realizing the truth, immediately went to Tamura Toji's address to arrest him for selling firearms. To their surprise, Tamura brandished a handgun, intending to resist, but was apprehended, and the handgun, a .32 caliber revolver containing six bullets, was seized. Nineteen additional bullets were found in a drawer and taken to the police station. It was learned that Tamura Toji was only 19 years old, his father was Japanese, and his mother was Russian. He was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case, stating that the victim, Komu Sadayoshi, was in the hospital and unwilling to testify in court. He requested that the defendant be temporarily detained for further investigation. The Chinese and Western detectives then reported on the circumstances of the defendant's arrest and presented the seized firearms and ammunition. The defendant confessed that he had recently purchased the handgun from a Russian named墨克拉near the Cathay Theater on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, around the 16th of this month. Yesterday, Kinoshita Ryota and Komu Sadayoshi came to his house to look at the handgun. At that time, there were no bullets in it. Kinoshita Ryota then loaded the bullets and accidentally fired it, injuring Komu Sadayoshi's arm. He denied selling it. His other statements were evasive. Judge Xiao Xieye ordered him to be detained and reassigned to the Seventh Division for further investigation. According to the North China Daily News, the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road reported last Saturday night that a young Japanese man had come to the hospital claiming that he had been shot in an alley off of Baixing Road at around 10:30 PM that night. Police from the German and Japanese consulates were immediately dispatched, and the Hongkou Police Station also sent officers to investigate. It was learned that the Japanese man was an employee of a Japanese clothing store, aged 20, and that his companion, a 16-year-old unemployed Japanese man, had claimed to witness the shooting but was unable to provide details. The hospital removed the bullet from the injured Japanese man's left arm, and the Japanese police escorted the two men to the site of the shooting to demonstrate the circumstances of the attack. Both men claimed that they had been shot in front of No. 34 Park Lane, but they were unable to identify the attacker. Because their statements were vague, they were taken to the Japanese Police Headquarters for separate questioning, but their testimonies were contradictory. After further questioning, the two men confessed that they had lied and that the injury had occurred when his companion had accidentally fired a handgun. The handgun belonged to a mixed-race individual who had not been recognized as Japanese. The incident occurred at a Japanese dormitory at No. 347 Miller Road at 9:30 PM. The two boys had fabricated the story because they were afraid of being punished. At 1:50 AM Sunday morning, after strict questioning by the Japanese authorities, they were released. After receiving the report from the Japanese police, the Hongkou Police Station arrested the owner of the handgun and will ask the Chinese court to prosecute him for illegal possession of weapons.</p>

<h3>Polish and Russian Men Exposed in Fake Platinum Fraud Case</h3>
<p>Shuanglong Foreign Firm Nearly Lost a Large Sum, Police Detectives Discovered the Secret</p>
<p>Adam Skan, a Polish man, aged 48, residing at No. 48 Molier Road, and柏來司甘, a Russian man, aged 54, residing at No. 49 Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road, specialized in defrauding others of their property. They had been sentenced by the court several times for previous cases. Recently, the two men colluded to defraud a large sum of money from the Shuanglong Foreign Firm at No. 244 Nanjing Road, but the scheme was foiled by police officers due to insufficient secrecy. The details of the incident are as follows:爱达姆司甘became acquainted with赫尔因, a senior employee of Shuanglong Foreign Firm, through business dealings. On March 25th of this year, 爱氏visited Shuanglong and told赫尔 that his friend柏來司甘 had recently arrived in Shanghai from the Soviet Union, carrying a large quantity of platinum that he intended to sell, and offered to introduce them. Since Shuanglong specialized in selling various jewelry items, platinum was a necessary commodity. 赫尔 contacted柏氏 several times, and they agreed to meet at柏氏's apartment at No. 690 Avenue Haig on April 5th to view samples. 赫尔 arrived as scheduled, and 爱柏 two men placed a large quantity of platinum on the table. However, it was difficult to determine the authenticity of the platinum without testing. 赫尔 selected a few smaller pieces for testing by Japanese and German experts. However, the platinum was all counterfeit. 爱以 replaced the genuine samples with fakes under the guise of wrapping them up. At that time, both parties agreed on a price of 30,000 yuan. Before the test results were available, the goods were stored in the Holland Bank in the name of Shuanglong, and the receipt was held by柏來司甘. 赫尔 immediately paid a deposit of 5,293 yuan. However, the incident was discovered by Chief Inspector贝宁 of the General Patrol Room, who immediately notified Shuanglong Foreign Firm not to accept the payment. He then devised a plan to have 赫尔 summon 爱柏 on the afternoon of the 22nd to Shuanglong, falsely claiming that the test report had arrived and confirmed that the goods were genuine but of slightly inferior quality, so the price had to be reduced. 爱柏 agreed to reduce the price by 10,000 yuan. Inspector贝, witnessing this situation, knew that the two men were indeed fraudulent and arrested them. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the above situation, stating that the police had obtained confessions from the two defendants, but there were still many unclear points that needed to be investigated. Therefore, they were not pressing charges for the time being, but only requested permission to detain them. Judge Pan Zhentang briefly questioned the two defendants and ordered them to be detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Russian Constable Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Russian Constable No. 94 of the French Criminal Division, accompanied by Chinese Constable No. 626, patrolled the streets yesterday afternoon at approximately 10:00 PM. While passing by the front door of an empty house at No. 11 Zhubao Third Road, the Russian constable told the Chinese constable that he intended to urinate inside and asked him to wait outside. After saying this, he walked into the empty house. Shortly after, a gunshot was heard. Chinese Constable No. 626 heard the gunshot coming from inside the empty house and immediately ran in, finding Russian Constable No. 94 had shot himself and was lying in a pool of blood, already dead. Chinese Constable No. 626 immediately went outside to report to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate. An ambulance was sent to the hospital, but it was impossible to save him. The body was transferred to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>Two Silk and Cotton Factories Robbed</h3>
<p>Losses Exceeding One Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>At 9:15 PM the night before last, five robbers speaking the Jiangbei dialect, armed with two handguns, suddenly entered the home of Xu Bu, the owner of the Qingsheng Silk and Cotton Factory at No. 13 Zhongxing Lane, Yongxing Road,閘北. They forced the family members into one room, threatening them to remain silent. They ransacked the place, stealing 283 yuan in legal tender, 272角 in corner notes, a gold bracelet, a gold ring, a woman's watch, and other clothing and accessories, worth approximately 800 yuan. Around 11:00 PM, six robbers speaking the Jiangbei and local dialects also entered the Xieshun Silk and Cotton Factory (owned by Zhou Erzhong) at No. 22 Taiyuan Lane, Zhongxing Road. One of the robbers was wearing a Western suit, and four of the robbers were armed with handguns. They stole 360 yuan in legal tender and 40角 in corner notes, with a total loss of approximately 1,000 yuan. The victims reported the losses to the Taiyang Temple Police Substation and the Zhongxing Road Police Substation, respectively, requesting the arrest of the thieves.</p>

<h3>Family Disputes Arise After Xi Lanqing's Death</h3>
<p>Woman Nie Guizhi Requests Confirmation of Identity, British Woman Sues Xi Furen for Repayment of Debt</p>
<p>Xi Lanqing, a man from Pudong, aged 72, died of illness in Hangzhou this spring. After Xi's death, his concubine Zhou Huilin colluded with Fu Minzhai and others to seize his estate. Xi's children reported the incident to the police station and filed a public lawsuit, resulting in fines being imposed by the First Special District Court. Before his death, Xi Lanqing had been sued by Nie Guizhi, a woman from Yushan, Jiangxi, in her twenties, in the First Special District Court for abandonment. In the complaint, Lanqing was mistakenly listed as Laichun. The facts of the case were that she had met Xi in Hangzhou in November of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) through an introduction and had been accepted as his concubine. However, in July of last year, Xi suddenly refused to keep her and abandoned her, so she filed the lawsuit, requesting an order for him to pay 36,000 yuan in living expenses. After the First Special District Court heard the case, Xi was declared innocent. Now that Xi has passed away, Nie has revived the old matter and filed a civil lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Xi's son, Xi Deshen, and others, requesting a judgment confirming that the plaintiff, Nie Guizhi, is a member of the Xi family. The case was heard by Judge Mo Runhua in the Sixth Civil Court yesterday afternoon. The defendants, Xi Deshen, and others, retained lawyer Zhao Chuanding, who absolutely denied the facts alleged by the plaintiff and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. After questioning by Judge Mo, the case was adjourned for further hearing. Xi Furen, son of Xi Lanqing, married the British woman爱思太罗比奚氏in Hong Kong in the 6th year of the Republic (1917). From the 7th year of the Republic (1918) to the 14th year of the Republic (1925), Xi had repeatedly borrowed a total of 20,000 taels from爱, for which he wrote promissory notes. Now that Xi's father, Lanqing, has passed away and left a substantial estate, of which Furen is entitled to a large share, she sent a letter urging him to pay, but he ignored it. Therefore,爱氏 retained lawyer Wu Linkun and filed a lawsuit against Xi Furen in the First Special District Court, requesting a judgment ordering him to repay 27,972 yuan in national currency (calculated by converting taels to national currency), plus statutory interest from the date of execution. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Fushen heard the case in the Twelfth Civil Court. Xi Furen retained lawyer Zhao Chuanding, who presented various reasons why he could not pay the debt and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. After Judge Xu reviewed the report, he ordered the closing of the argument and scheduled a date for the verdict.</p>
<h3>Mezzanines Must Have Fire Exits</h3>
<p>Not Completely Demolished</p>
<p>In order to improve living conditions within the Public Concession, the Municipal Council is said to be considering demolishing all mezzanines. The various circles in the city are paying close attention to this matter. According to a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, the Municipal Council has appointed a subcommittee consisting of Chinese directors Jiang Yiping and Xi Yushu, and Western director Jin Jun, to study the matter. They are currently unwilling to comment on the matter. The motivation for this matter is based on the recommendation of the "Committee for Investigating Living Conditions," which was established by the Municipal Council through a resolution passed at the Western Annual Meeting in 1936. After a long period of investigation, the committee made this recommendation to the Municipal Council regarding the improvement of living conditions. Regarding the mezzanine portion, it stated that "Mezzanines must be structurally sound and have adequate exits for fire emergencies to be allowed to remain." Therefore, the committee's recommendation requires the above-mentioned improvements to mezzanines and does not call for their demolition in all cases. In addition to the mezzanine issue, the committee's recommendations for improving living conditions also include prohibiting the conversion of balconies into rooms.</p>
<h3>Huxi Yiyou Factory Resumes Work Today</h3>
<p>The Yiyou Silk Weaving Factory on Bailinan Road in Huxi was shut down after the factory failed to comply with the Social Affairs Bureau's ruling, which caused dissatisfaction among all the workers, who declared a strike that has lasted more than ten days. The Municipal Party Department sent personnel to mediate, but the mediation was ineffective. Yesterday, all the workers went to the Municipal Party Department to petition, where they were received by Lu Yinchu. He pointed out that the factory's failure to comply with the government authorities' ruling was unreasonable, and that the workers' declaration of a strike despite the authorities' repeated orders prohibiting strikes was also illegal. He advised the workers to resume work first, and the Party Department would be responsible for mediating their demands. In order to comply with the authorities' orders, the workers have agreed to resume work at the factory this morning.</p>
<h3>French Municipal Council Director Sibleyman Attacked</h3>
<p>The Assailant is an Eighteen-Year-Old Filipino, Reportedly as Revenge for a Denied Loan</p>
<p>Sibleyman (transliteration), a French national residing at No. 150 Avenue Pichon, French Concession, former manager of the International Savings Society and current director of the French Municipal Council and manager of the French-owned Ulmann jewelry and watch store on Nanjing Road, was attacked in his residence at 12:30 AM yesterday while soundly asleep. An eighteen-year-old Filipino man, taking advantage of the inattentiveness of Sibleyman's family servants, sneaked into Sibleyman's bedroom and stabbed Sibleyman in the neck with a knife. The assailant, seeing that his objective had been achieved, fled the house and escaped. Sibleyman was awakened by the pain and cried out loudly, but the assailant had already escaped. The family reported the incident to the French police by telephone, and detectives rushed to the scene to investigate. The injured man was sent to the Guangci Hospital for treatment, and the police notified all police stations in the Public Concession to assist in the search for the suspect. After fleeing Sibleyman's residence, the assailant hired a rickshaw to Hongkou, but because he had no money to pay the fare, the rickshaw puller,崔大福, from Jiangbei, saw that he was stained with blood and realized that he was not a legitimate person. He called the police, who arrested him. Under interrogation, he confessed that he was the assailant who had attacked Sibleyman. He was detained and the French police were notified, who dispatched detectives to transfer him back to their custody for investigation. The police learned that the motive for the attack was that he had asked Sibleyman for a loan of 2,000 yuan but was refused, and had taken revenge. The police fear that the assailant was acting under instructions from someone else and are conducting a thorough investigation. Once the investigation is complete, the suspect will be transferred to the relevant consulate for legal proceedings. According to the 大美晚報, Mr.史丕尔曼, an employee of the International Savings Society, residing at No. 150 Avenue Pichon, was awakened by a noise in the bathroom in his bedroom at 1:00 AM this morning (24th). He suddenly saw a man enter the room, demanding money. The man held a water bottle taken from the bathroom. Mr.史 jumped up to apprehend him, and a struggle ensued. The man struck 史 on the head several times with the water bottle, breaking the bottle and cutting his own hand. 史's servants heard the noise and came to his aid, capturing the man, locking him in the bathroom. Then they reported to the French police. When the detectives arrived, the man had already escaped through the window. They sent 史 to the广慈肾院. 史's head had several injuries, but they were not serious. The French police subsequently notified all police stations in the Public Concession and the Chinese police局 by radio, requesting their cooperation in apprehending the assailant. The assailant had injured his hand and was bleeding, so he might seek treatment at a hospital. Half an hour later, a Western police officer from the Hongkou police station saw a man in a rickshaw, stopped somewhere, who had no money to pay his fare. His hands and clothes were stained with blood, so he went forward to question him. The man initially denied it, but when taken to the headquarters of the French Concession, he finally confessed to the attack. According to the police, the man is of mixed Chinese and Dutch descent and claims to be Dutch. 史 is also Dutch. The man is only eighteen years old. He arrived in Shanghai last October via Hong Kong from Java. The Hong Kong authorities expelled him. After arriving in Shanghai, he was arrested for drunkenness and released. In March of this year, he attempted suicide in the Salvation Army's shelter. He has now been handed over to the Dutch consulate for investigation. The police believe that the man's words are incoherent and that he may be mentally ill. The letters found in his bag can attest to this.</p>

<h3>Mediation of Disputes Regarding Contract Revisions at Chinese Electrical Company Still Yields No Results</h3>
<p>Workers of the Nanshi Chinese Electrical Company (i.e., the First District Water and Electrical Workers' Union) have been requesting revisions to service regulations from the factory for nearly half a year. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the Bureau of Social Affairs convened a second mediation session. The Bureau was represented by Chairman Zhu Jintao. Representatives from the municipal authorities included Lu Yinchu. Labor representatives were Xu Wangsheng and Fu Chongde. Management representatives were Shen Yuping and Du Ningru. They indicated to the Bureau that they were attending on the orders of Manager Lu of the company and requested a further 20-day extension. They also stated they did not have the authority to negotiate any regulations on behalf of the company. Upon hearing this, the labor representatives stated that management had repeatedly delayed for several months and that repeated extension requests made the labor party feel there was no sincerity in accepting requests. They requested the Bureau to resolve the wage scale first and to convene another mediation session within the week. Chairman Zhu Jintao, after consulting with management representatives, agreed to schedule another mediation session to negotiate and resolve the wage scale first.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at approximately 4:00 PM, a young woman in student attire attempted to drown herself at the Bund New Customs Wharf. She was spotted and rescued by a guard. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attempted Suicide at New Customs Wharf</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at approximately 4:00 PM, a young woman in student attire arrived at the Bund New Customs Wharf and attempted to drown herself. Fortunately, she was spotted by a guard, who brought her back to the Fourth Road General Police Station. She stated her name was Mao Aibao, from Zhoushan, Ningbo, and she had been studying in Jiangyin. The reason for her attempted suicide was that she had come to Shanghai to apply to a hospital to work as a nurse, but failed the entrance exam, so she resorted to this. The rest of her statement was disjointed and seemed to conceal information. The police brought her to the Ningbo Association in Shanghai for assistance yesterday morning at 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>Educated but Seems to be Concealing Something</p>
<p>After the woman was sent to the association, they questioned her further. She then stated that she was from Cixi, Ningbo, and had been studying at the Sheng Gong Hui Shende Girls' School in Ningbo Laobeimen for six years. This time, she came to Shanghai with her classmate to apply to a hospital to work as a nurse. Her classmate had already been accepted, but she had not, so she was ashamed and regretful. She also claimed that both her parents were dead and she had no relatives. Furthermore, she did not want to return to school and requested to be transferred to the Catholic Church for assistance. Based on her statement, the association felt there were still inconsistencies. They plan to send her to the Women and Children's Relief Society for temporary care and hope her family will come forward to claim her. The woman has bobbed hair, is of medium build, and is wearing a dark blue cotton qipao. Her handwriting is elegant and neat when she wrote down what happened, indicating she has received considerable education.</p>
<h3>Absurdity: Arranging a Marriage for the City God</h3>
<p>In Dongjing Temple in Dongzhakou, Yangjing Town, Pudong, the statue of the mighty City God of Weiling was matched as a husband. Some local female sorcerers took the initiative to arrange a marriage for him, creating a statue of the deceased daughter Yue'e of Chen Qiutao, the meat shop owner from Xishi Town, as the wife of the City God. The "wedding" was scheduled for the 25th of last month. All the rituals were the same as for living people, causing a sensation and amazement throughout the community. After this incident, local public groups criticized it as excessively superstitious. Former Chief Zhang of the Pudong Branch Bureau also issued a strict order to Director Cai of the Yangjing Police Station, believing that in this age of scientific progress, it was a violation of the spirit of the times, as a warning to others. Director Cai repeatedly ordered the temple owner and the City God's "father-in-law" to destroy the statue of the "bride" in public. The two men were terrified and have now completely dismantled and removed all the brand-new furniture and decorations from the bridal chamber. The statue of the "bride" also suddenly disappeared recently. This amusing farce has thus come to an end.</p>
<h3>Qichang Pawnshop Temporarily Closed Due to Fire; Deadline for Redemption</h3>
<p>Qichang Pawnshop suddenly suffered a fire on the night of the 6th of this month. Many of the pawned items were destroyed by the fire, and even more were damaged by water during firefighting efforts. Efforts have been made to dry them, and a location has been rented at No. 99, intersection of Dongxi Huade Road and Yuanchang Road, for redemption. Due to the temporary closure caused by the fire, and to expedite closure, the period from May 22nd is set as the redemption period, which will last for one month. Items not redeemed by the deadline will be auctioned off. For pawned items destroyed by fire, compensation will be paid at 30% of the pawned amount, as per pawnshop industry practice. Items damaged by water can be redeemed as usual, without compensation.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>"Suppressing Communism" and "Studying the Classics"</h3>
<p>— Hong Fa</p>
<p>In Journey to the West, I remember there's a passage like this: Although Sun Wukong has boundless magical powers, he is most afraid of Guanyin Bodhisattva chanting the mantra. When this Great Sage Equaling Heaven wants to cause trouble on earth, she silently chants the mantra. Then the band around this Monkey King's neck tightens even more, to the point that he is in so much pain that he wets and soils himself, and has no choice but to kneel down and beg for mercy.</p>
<p>Whenever I see this part, I can't help but wonder: Can it be that so-called classic texts really have such a subtle effect?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this mantra has long been lost. Fortunately, some existing texts still have such a subtle effect.</p>
<p>Although there are many Chinese classics, it is generally accepted by scholars that most of them contain everlasting philosophical principles. "Half of the Analects can govern the world." Let's not mention this cliché. During the Song Dynasty, there was indeed a prime minister who sat on the city wall and saw enemy soldiers attacking. He held a classic text and desperately chanted it, believing that doing so could make the enemy retreat.</p>
<p>It can be seen that in our country, classics have always been regarded as having unexpected effects, just like a panacea. Although this may seem like an insult to them,</p>
<p>even if it is an insult, it is true that they have very magical effects. We only need to look at the relationship between the rise and fall of classical studies in history and the rise and fall of the world. The two have always maintained an inseparable relationship. This principle can always be believed. To take a recent example, after the May Fourth Movement, heresies ran rampant. Some people advocated overthrowing the Confucian shop, abolishing old ethics, and destroying inherent morality. As a result, young students all over the country were poisoned like crazy, and followed the trend. Not long after, the purge came, and many people died under blind faith. At this time, the haze really scattered, and the world became clear.</p>
<p>However, the price of this clarification was paid with life and blood. If you want to extinguish heresy, you have to rely on force. For example, the reason why the Ma Day Incident was quickly quelled was also due to the "burned head and broken forehead."</p>
<p>Recently, He Jian, the chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, gave a speech at the Hunan Anti-Communist Memorial Meeting on the 21st, repeatedly elaborating on the relationship between suppressing communism and studying the classics, and concluding that it is especially important not to forget studying the classics when suppressing communism. The importance of this principle has been deeply stated in his proposal to the Third Plenary Session. Now it is just restating it again on Memorial Week. From this, it can be seen that if you want to extinguish heresy, you must study the classics. If studying the classics is not useful, you can only start to "suppress." "Suppressing" is force, and "studying the classics" is civil governance: Civil governance and force can be used together to achieve the effect of complementing each other. Don't you see that Muhammad's evangelism was with a sword in one hand and the Koran in the other?</p>
<h3>Abolition of the Death Penalty</h3>
<p>— Yun Xi</p>
<p>Regarding the question of whether the death penalty should be abolished, I remember that there was a big debate at one time, but later, somehow, this topic was cleverly transformed into an improvement of the death penalty. In fact, the so-called emotion about the cruelty of hanging and the guillotine to the executed is designing an improved death penalty to reduce the suffering of the executed. To put it bluntly, it is a bit like a "death penalty art appreciator" studying the beauty of an executed person in the process of execution. Later, some countries changed to electrocution, which may be the result of research by this group of "death penalty art appreciators"; and that is the answer to whether the death penalty should be abolished.</p>
<p>Of course, we admit that the issue of whether the death penalty should be abolished involves a very wide range, especially the research on the executed person itself, which is highly debated. And perhaps some people will admit that the survival of a criminal is enough to affect the safety of future generations, but we have recently seen the abolition of the death penalty discussed as a parliamentary motion and passed. The following is a piece of small news from various newspapers on the 19th of this month:</p>
<p>"Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA: The state legislature of this state recently passed a bill by a vote of 100 to 87, advocating the abolition of the death penalty."</p>
<p>Defeating those who oppose the abolition of the death penalty by a difference of 13 votes is believed to have gone through a rather heated debate. However, it was finally passed. In this bloody world where the innocent killing of the death penalty has become a legitimate act today, it raises serious protests: And the news such as "200 Italian soldiers were shot for refusing to go to Spain to fight" is an extremely strong irony.</p>
<p>Therefore, the abolition of the death penalty has a very positive meaning in a world where human rights have lost protection and a dictator can arbitrarily trample on his people. But in the judicial system itself, the promotion of the abolition of the death penalty can be said to be very insufficient. Let's take the United States itself as an example. The white people's casual use of illegal lynching against black people has also been criticized as a serious matter. But with the connivance of customs, some innocent black people have suffered at the hands of the law. It is a bit unbelievable to talk about the abolition of the death penalty when the anti-legal behavior of lynching has not been effectively dealt with.</p>
<p>Of course, what I am saying is not to oppose the abolition of the death penalty, but to supplement the abolition of the death penalty. That is to say, when we feel that the death penalty does need to be abolished, we should think of other punishments that are ten thousand times more cruel than the death penalty, and we should deal with them in appropriate ways. For example, in recent news, we often see the abuse by law enforcement agencies of people who have not yet been identified as criminals. The opposition to this unreasonable lynching should be prior to calling for the abolition of the death penalty. For example, the newspaper on the 18th reported: "Zhou Apin, a suspected thief, was tortured to death, and the forensic doctor has examined and identified it as true." That is unreasonable in terms of human rights protection and judicial system. If we ignore these illegal lynching that are more cruel than the death penalty and talk about the abolition of the death penalty, it is meaningless.</p>
<h3>At the Yunlang River Inn</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>— Miscellaneous Notes on Mountain Travel</p>
<p>After passing Weikou'e, perhaps it was heatstroke, the coolie carrying Lao Tie and me collapsed. White foam was coming out of his mouth, his eyes drooping, his purplish-brown face covered in a layer of green. That's how we were thrown off. I scraped my elbow, while Lao Tie injured his knee.</p>
<p>In the chaos, I couldn't think of a good solution. Our companions had already gone far ahead. We had no choice but to dip copper coins in our own saliva and desperately scrape his back and armpits, revealing purple-red stripes. Then, we had two other coolies carry a sedan chair to settle them down, and we shouldered another sedan chair, using relaxed terminology, climbing, panting, and resting at the Yunlang River Inn.</p>
<h3>Public Office</h3>
<p>At the street corner, a crowd had gathered, making a ruckus as if someone had died. I wanted to go take a look, but the sedan chair was tightly fitted on my head, not allowing me to move. By the time I took off the yoke and ran out, the excitement had not yet dissipated.</p>
<p>There weren't many main characters, only three. Two of them, roughly the same age, were brothers, and the older one was the locally renowned foreman of the village. The reason was simple: they were all from the Tian family. Because they needed to repair the road, but there were no funds for the repairs, they conscripted labor. The work was quite extensive. How long was the entire route, how many stages were divided into, which section did each stage occupy, how many villages were included in this section, and how many able-bodied young men were available in each village. Then, they estimated the work time and the amount of labor required, and thus determined the quotas. Suppose this section needs to be completed in four phases, the total number of conscripted laborers is divided into four parts. Regardless of the weather, the workers assigned to a certain part had to shoulder the burden and perform their duties.</p>
<p>There was no wage. For one day of work, they were allowed to receive food expenses of one or two dimes. Of course, it was also possible not to work, by estimating your working period and posting the expenses, you could hire a worker to act as a substitute.</p>
<p>In the impoverished village, money was like their own blood. "Posting fees" was seen as transcending their own lives. Struggling, they carried hoes and shovels, digging down stones and evenly placing them on the road. A wooden bridge with a right-angled frame, a road surface paved with gravel, was completed one after another.</p>
<p>But, they are all farmers! Although they are mountain fields, they cannot be abandoned casually. But, what about the food money?</p>
<p>The two strong young men were probably really angry, the blue veins on their foreheads twitching.</p>
<p>—Think with your conscience, we've worked for more than a month, and you've only paid us for ten days! Then, a finger pointed to his nose: People's hearts are made of flesh, you can't get fat by deducting, understand?</p>
<p>The onlookers made a commotion, heckling, shouting, laughing, making a mess. The foreman softened, unable to lift his head. The sweat on his short cloth shirt was salty and sour, sweeping past people's nostrils. His complexion, buried in heavy smoking addiction, was even more green and gray.</p>
<p>—This, this, it's not my fault, I'm just the foreman. The money has to be handed down from the public office!</p>
<p>—Public office? That bastard Sun isn't a good thing either, you're all colluding... After that, the crowd all crowded to the public office.</p>
<p>The public office was converted from a temple, quite spacious and also very dilapidated. A "high-leg stage" was also built in the second courtyard. The stage could be freely entered and exited from underneath. There was a private school in the left wing room. There were thirty or forty students, and the teacher was an old man. When lecturing, the students also followed the teacher's "example," swaying their entire bodies. In the right wing room, perhaps it was Director Sun? He was old, not far from the grave, and at this moment, was lying across a bed, exhaling thick smoke.</p>
<p>The unexpected disturbance made him very unhappy. After all, the "Director" had his own dignity, and he couldn't be as casual as when talking to the foreman. As a result, it was not unexpected, the issue of money was rejected in one breath!</p>
<p>—I think this matter must be taken to the city. He spat out a mouthful of smoke, because this is controlled by the city!</p>
<p>Going to the city is really not easy. In the sweltering heat, the round trip takes several days, and you have to leave the work in the fields. The city is not a place that ordinary people can go to casually.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Perhaps what you get, in addition to perfunctory or scolding, is still an empty field.</p>
<p>The anger completely disappeared. Looking at the golden bells hanging upside down under the temple eaves, perhaps they should think that this is their own "fate," and leave with the setting sun with sadness. The director laughed, casting a disdainful glance, and lay down on the bed again. The public office was locked in ancient loneliness again.</p>
<h3>Towing a Boat</h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>— Want to hire a boat-towing coolie?</p>
<p>— Hire a short-term worker, five hundred cash a day, to take you no less than eighty miles.</p>
<p>The boats that were anchored in the port at night, headed downstream, one by one raised their anchors. The long bamboo poles touched the river bank, pushing the boat towards the center of the river. The helmsman leisurely sat at the stern, steadily holding the helm, not exerting himself at all. In an instant, the boat, like a falling leaf in a gust of wind, followed the gurgling current, towards the distance, like a wisp of floating cloud in the blue sky, facing the golden sun. The forests and villages were left behind, light and nimble, like a purple swallow, skimming over the water, sailing so peacefully.</p>
<p>A cargo ship heading upstream was still stopped there. The person in charge of the boat stood proudly at the bow, arguing about the price with a group of boat-towing coolies on the shore, like a flock of hungry crows.</p>
<p>The coolies, with their mouths accustomed to soliciting business, expressed their suffering!</p>
<p>—Five hundred cash is too much? We have to eat lunch! Eighty miles against the current, if we encounter headwind, we won't be able to go home. Sleeping in the wild is nothing, but our wives and children are waiting for money to buy food!</p>
<p>The person in charge of the boat understood everything. They were telling the truth, but they still had to deduct two hundred cash from each person, as if they were buying livestock, picking out six dark, strong men.</p>
<p>The towing planks were put on each person's shoulders. The towing ropes were tied to a thick hemp rope. The hemp rope was firmly tied to the main post on the boat. The boatmen sang a wordless song in unison. The loud song was accompanied by the clanging of iron chains. The anchor was pulled up, and the boat immediately floated on the water like a duckweed without roots, following the water's momentum, gradually retreating downstream, but it was fixed by several long poles probing into the water. The poles bent like the back of a bow. The water stubbornly splashed and roared. The boat-towing coolies on the shore stood in a row, shouting in unison, their bodies leaning forward. They didn't fall, but the boat slowly moved.</p>
<p>The boat was full of dried fruits such as walnuts and dates. The sacks were piled as high as a person. The weight was heavy, and the draft was deep. The side of the boat was almost level with the water. The muddy yellow river water relentlessly beat against the bow of the boat, stirring up several whirlpools, and then diverting to both sides of the hull.</p>
<p>The coolies poured all their energy into the towing planks, humming with the same hoarse voices:</p>
<p>"Hmm, hey ah, hmm oh, hey oh..."</p>
<p>Along the riverbanks, there were constantly one or two thatched huts. Under the willow trees in front of the huts, fishermen were chatting or mending broken nets. They knew each other well. The boat-towing coolies would often straighten their backs at this time, wipe the sweat the size of soybeans from their foreheads, and ask them if they wanted to send anything. The fishermen shook their heads infinitely sadly, stopped their bamboo needles, and watched them disappear into the river bend.</p>
<p>The owner of the cargo ship lit a long dry pipe, blowing out bag after bag of gray smoke. He stroked his fat breasts and told the helmsman about the difficulty of doing business:</p>
<p>—Going upstream by boat, it takes three and a half days. The foot fee is thirty silver dollars. After deducting our labor and food costs, all the small miscellaneous expenses, there is not enough left to sleep with a prostitute in San Sen, Tianjin for one night!</p>
<p>The helmsman changed his arms, saying seriously:</p>
<p>—The bald man came back to Tianjin to Sanbuguan and stayed for one night, spending a few dollars. Now he is lying down and can't move!</p>
<p>—He has a lustful mouth, I'm not like him. I want to save some money to marry a wife for my son who is learning a craft in the city!</p>
<p>The two felt that the dream was too absurd, so they stopped talking. When it was time for lunch, the boat dropped anchor. The boat-towing coolies took out large pancakes soaked in sweat from their arms, and sat on the grass to stuff them into their mouths, so flustered that they should be scolded as starving ghosts. The person in charge of the boat looked at the sun and said with a frown:</p>
<p>—I said the shadow of the sun is already slanting, and we have only walked thirty miles. If we can't reach Zhumadian tonight, each of you will be deducted five hundred cash!</p>
