<h3>紫金山我陣地後移京市近郊展開血戰</h3>
<p>蔣委員長昨晨乘飛機離京　首都各城門晚間一律關閉　軍火庫飛機塲我開始破壞</p>
<p>［漢口］蔣委員長今晨乘飛機離京、目的地未悉、衆信已抵南昌、（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>［東京］據此間所接中國傳來之消息、日本海陸空軍今晨聯合向南京與蕪湖施行總攻擊、此爲昨晚日軍佔領紫金山之進展、南京衛戌司令唐生智、昨諭令晚間各城門一律關閉、事前曾勸旅京外僑全體退去、故除少數外籍新聞記者外、各外僑已於昨日午後一時離京、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>［南京］首都在其悠久之歷史中、行將第一次淪陷於外人之手、中國守軍已於今日起對於軍火庫、汽油機、飛機庫、及工塲等、開始作有系統之破壞、所有損壞飛機、一時不能修復者、本日亦悉行毁去、惟完好之飛機、则均於今晨離京、飛往內地之根據地、據尚未證實之消息云、華軍或將於退出之前、將政府壯麗建築及人民住屋所在之城市、付諸一炬、中國軍事當局、爲免除日軍利用作掩蔽起見、擬將南京各軍事要點之房屋、悉行焚燬、現有三處已起大火矣、同時華軍當局已採取嚴峻方法、制止搶掠、據云已有嫌疑之搶刦者六人、被槍决、四名在車站附近、二名在江邊、又有一百餘人、已在城外被捕、今晨有太古公司拖船一艘、正由怡和躉船開出時、在一小舟中之華兵二人擬阻留之、該拖船不顧、仍向前駛行、華兵乃向之開槍數響、但拖船上英人、咸平臥艙面、故無一受傷、自日機轟炸蕪湖後、英船現已不復上駛、今日蕪湖又遭日機襲擊數次、太古貨棧被炸彈擊中、但尚未有外人死傷報吿、日軍現漸追近京郊、城中居民現皆避入安全區、國際委員會已請日方勿在安全區作戰、該委員會今日函致日當局、謂中當局業已撤退安全區內之軍事機關與軍隊、故委員會刻正辦理該區劃界事宜、希望日方勿轟炸該區云、函內對於日當局所稱日軍不欲攻擊不駐兵及不設軍事機關之地方一節、表示欣慰、並聲稱區內有外僑十五人至二十人、凖備擔任區內行政事宜云、法艦査尼爾號、今日十二時半開往上游、大約係赴蕪湖、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>日軍三路猛犯南京</h3>
<p>外息、日軍對大南京之進犯、刻已判明爲三路、一爲自句容以北、繞至湯水鎭北、九華山之背面、沿小路而攻我麒麟門、此路全部約有兩個聯隊、二爲自句容正南二十二公里之天王寺、沿石子路攻我光華門東、東南十二公里之淳化鎭、此路約有三聯隊、及一機械化兵團、似爲日軍之主力、攻犯甚猛、昨曾以大批飛機輪流轟炸、助其攻勢、我軍昨已自淳化南十公里湖熟鎭北移、與日軍相持於淳化鎭以南、昨晚曾在該處擊斃日軍前頭部隊數十人、獲步槍二十餘枝、旗幟文件數種、日軍進攻之第三路綫、爲自溧水北　、人數亦約兩聯隊左右、我軍三四兩日曾在秣陵關與日軍激戰、昨已北移、正相持於秣陵關北五六公里之殷巷鎭西南、本日尚無激戰、且前日軍之進路均被我保衛大南京之基本部隊阻住、欲圖再進、當有重大犧性、</p>
<h3>留京外僑已登炮艦</h3>
<p>［漢口］中國首都之大戰、現已迫在眉睫、據此間消息、日軍已達揚子江秣陵關附近之某點、對南京成半包圍形勢、中國軍隊在南京城郊者有三十萬人、其中有二十萬人爲地方軍隊、一切工事、都已佈置就緒、各種事實均顯示政府盡力保衛首都之决心、中國方面頗佔地利、因首都衆山環拱、如棲霞山紫金山湯山之類、列峙郭外、日軍必先破壞諸山防務、始能進占首都也、“抵抗日本至最後一滴血”、爲京郊十四師人之口號、至於城中生活雖緊張程度日益增加、但人民認大戰之來、遲早終不可免、故亦安之若素、並不張皇、城中街道充滿軍事設施、政府官署亦由軍隊駐守、窗口均已架設機關槍、城中及南京附近業已宣布戒嚴、實施軍法、留京外僑之最後五十人、亦已撤退、同登砲艦、停於南京上游三英里之地方、該處對京郊砲聲可淸晰聽見也、德國人留京者現尚有十二人、包括使館官吏及敎會職員、但已凖備船隻、一俟時機危急、卽可登船西上云、（七日國民海通電）</p>
<p>南京自八日起、將非正式宣佈爲交戰地區、所有與保衛南京軍事無關之居民、須一律入難民區內、不得自由走出、同時街市內非有黃色衛戌看章、及應對口令者、不得通行、</p>
<h3>中山門外清晰炮聲</h3>
<p>外息、自句容繞至九華山背面攻我麒麟門之日軍千餘人、在湯水鎭正北五六里之孟塘、被我從中切斷、另由麒麟門以東之我守軍某部、對日軍包圍殲滅、記者於七日下午一時三十分、驅車至火綫觀戰、出中山門後、卽聞隆隆砲聲、自東北方襲來、並有密集槍聲、雜於其間、中山門外石瀝靑之京杭國道兩旁、我忠勇之生力部隊均源源趕赴前方、車中遙望陵園新邨之優美樓房、烟火冲天、初尚驚疑日兵已至、或奸人縱火、經詢沿途步哨、始悉爲我軍自動焚毀、過孝陵衛街、更見兩側房屋、均已焚燬、僅我在防禦戰上最需要之斷壁殘垣、矗然而立而已、車抵某地越十分鐘、因知我某軍所在地、乃下車訪晤軍事長官、據談我軍形勢已趨好轉、因我軍某部已自西北及正北兩方開到正對湯山背後之日軍取夾攻之勢云云、</p>
<h3>我駐重兵堅守蕪湖</h3>
<p>日軍之由溧水金壇進犯句容方面、雖以中國軍在此方面曾迭獲勝利、但仍不稍遏止、此種事實、據此間解釋、乃日軍司令部决定在任何情形之下、均必掌握住前進地方、同時日軍之進展亦頗形遲緩、實顯示日軍企圖對已佔有之地方、加以集結鞏固之後、然後再聯合海軍、大舉進攻南京、日軍在蕪湖方面之進展、因中國該處駐有大軍、亦受到阻礙、按蕪湖位於首都西面、若蕪湖失陷、則南京將處於腹背受敵之地位、故中國方面堅守蕪湖、守蕪湖卽所以守南京、此間相信、若蕪湖不幸失陷、南京之陷落必踵隨之云、（六日國民社電）</p>
<h3>日方亦謂戰事劇烈</h3>
<p>同盟社稱、占領金壇之伊佐、下枝、富士井、脇坂等日軍各部隊、已進抵句容南方、五日且已突破句容後方之索墅鎭、六日午前十時抵靑龍山、並更進攻、至正午時已進抵離南京東南約五基羅之處、一方由廣德方面猛進之岡本、竹下等各日軍部隊、五日午後已佔領寗國、並更繼續急進、將達蕪湖江邊、向蕪湖推進之長野、山田、長谷川、岡本等各日軍部隊、占領水陽鎭後、今晨已進抵距蕪湖約十五基羅之燿頭、目下仍在激戰、又攻略溧水之千葉、山田、山崎、山本等各部隊、目的在直搗南京之背、今晨已抵華軍堅壘之秣陵關、尚在猛攻中、又在北面陣地之安達、永津、淺間等各部隊、以一小部包圍攻擊鎭江要塞、其大部則自昨日起依然沿江向南京前進、故各地咸已展開極猛烈之戰事、</p>
<p>［東京］大本營陸軍部七日正午發表云、進攻南京日軍第一綫各部隊、已於本月七日晨刻將華軍正式防禦綫如棲霞山、（在南京東方約十八啟羅）靑龍山、（在南京東北方約八啟羅）方山、（在南京東南十五啟羅）等均經占領、攻略南京之體勢、至此已吿完成、（七日同盟社電）</p>

<p>上海泰晤士報云、昨據本埠官方表示、英政府對於星期日日飛機轟炸泊於蕪湖英船德和號與大通號、似將提出抗議、又悉、無論政府取何行動、英海軍當局對於英砲船瓢蟲號為日飛機炸彈碎片所中、並傷及其指揮官巴洛少佐、亦將提出抗議、昨日又據太古公司聲稱、大通號總機師摩理斯臂上受傷、德和號船尾附近曾中炸彈、恐乘客死者必多、上海泰晤士報探悉關於此案、本埠英領事不致有何行動、因蕪湖乃在南京領事區內、南京領事處目下情勢中、殊難作正式行動、而蕪湖又不在上海領事區內、故上海英總領事亦不致提出直接抗議、惟太古怡和兩公司將請英總領事以此案詳情轉報英政府、聞英海軍當局已考慮此事、且仍在研究此案之情報英總領事曾於星期日由電話將蕪湖二英船被轟炸與英砲船指揮受傷之事實通知日總領事、兩船外人雖無死者、但衆信中國乘客或因為炸彈擊中、或因德和號起火、躍入江中、死者必多、昨日日軍發言人接見新聞訪員時、據答、日當局尚未接有此案詳情、發言人又稱、日飛機曾在蕪湖與該地附近轟炸華軍、據天空觀察者報稱、該埠附近有華軍三萬名之衆、有問以其初英砲船指揮曾稱當日飛機轟炸之時、兩船附近並無華軍乎、該發言人乃謂日飛機乃轟炸乘民船渡江之華軍、又有人續向詢問、該發言人乃表示不願繼續評論此事、</p>

<h3>西班牙叛軍封鎖海岸</h3>
<p>英聲明不承認</p>
<p>［倫敦］西班牙國民軍總司令弗朗哥將軍日前提出照會、宣佈將該國政府軍所轄領海予以封鎖、並在領海內外埋設水雷、此項照會頃已由英國政府加以答覆、內稱、國民軍政府並未受人承認為交戰團體、英國政府不承認其有宣佈封鎖之權利、因之、英國船雙駛往西國政府軍所屬口岸者、仍可享受英國海軍之保護、至於埋設水雷一層、按之海牙國際公約第八節、凡在敵方領海內外埋設水雷、而僅以斷絕商業航運為目的者、概在禁止之列、故縱令國民軍已受人承認為交戰團體、此種埋設水雷之行動、亦屬違反國際法云（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］西班牙內亂不干涉辦法調整委員會所屬小組委員會、頃於今晨開會討論西班牙內戰雙方、對於撤退該國外國志願兵、及承認交戰團體兩項建議之覆文、外交界人士宣稱小組委員會討論結果、認為西班牙內戰當事雙方之覆文、係在原則上接受調整委員會之建議、惟德意兩國代表團以為西班牙共和政府之覆文、等于正式拒絕承認西國內戰當事雙方為交戰團體、反之、其他各國代表團、則以為、國民軍當局、主張內戰當用雙方、各將外國志願兵三千名撤退之後、即行承認雙方為交戰團體、此層碍難予以接受云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>大東旅社事件日領事前未知</h3>
<p>已向工部局總董聲明　並防止再有同類事件</p>
<p>日本總領事已向工部局總董聲明、本星期一大東旅社發生之案件、渠事前未曾知悉、並謂業已採取步驟、以免再有同類事件、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社七日倫敦電、日本警察昨在七海公共租界擅捕華人之後、當地工部局已向日本當局提出抗議、英國政界人士聞訊之餘、莫不表示贊同、咸謂日本警察僅可對於該國僑民行使職權、</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、昨晚得悉工部局對昨晨日人持武裝入大東旅館拘去四華人一案、曾開緊急會議討論之、將卽向領袖領事提出抗議、昨日下午日大使署發言人接見新聞訪員時、謂渠讀報後始知此事、發言人又答覆許多問話、堅稱渠不知實在情形、惟渠以為四華人被拘一案、與晚報所載四項要求、並無關係、有問其答語是否含有此案並非表示日當局有權能入公共租界、與取所認為必要行動之意、發言人答稱、渠在未接詳情以前、不欲續作答語、</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、大東旅館四華人之被‘綁架’、日方雖稱、乃因‘極端緊急’、故不及請准公共租界當局、但今日外國領事國甚注重此案、據稱縱屬極端緊急、並無法律根據將公共租界中國居民交與日當局、華人無效忠日本之義務、故不得責為叛變日本、如犯抗日活動之罪、則當由工部局向法院起訴、軍事佔領、並不施於公共租界、今日（七日）據工部局某高級人員聲稱、日人關於此案不能以已接管上海市政府之治權為言、因工部局從來准許中國當局在公共租界內捕人也、戰事發生之初、市政府曾圖拘捕所謂叛國者數人、但均經工部局警務處營救得免、於是警務處乃置巡捕於租界邊綫、以防有人强被拘出、如果中國當局交出叛國之證據、則租界當局將按名拘捕解交市政府云、</p>
<p>昨日下午領事團曾舉行會議、考慮‘綁架’案、惟將取何行動、現尚未悉、工部局重要人員之意、如日人隨時能入公共租界捕人、則租界中之華人、或享有領事裁判權之外人、將無一得保安全云、茲悉昨晨入大東旅館拘捕四華人者、乃係陸軍警察、初猶以為乃日領署警察也、</p>
<p>今日日當局接見新聞訪員時、談及此案、有人詢以日當局將來是否願與公共租界當局合作、發言人答稱、此須視工部局警務處將否取必要之步驟而定如警務處能取必要之步驟、則此類案件將來不致再見、發言人又否認外間謠傳多時日當局曾向工部局提出抗日份子之名單或向宣露日人欲加監視者之姓氏、</p>

<h3>世界銀市變幻</h3>
<p>美繼續購銀政策　人民應募公債券　超過原額十餘倍</p>
<p>［華盛頓］有人向財長毛根韜、美財部是否繼續購買白銀、毛財長笞稱、‘吾人正待羅斯福總統、之佈告’云、官方並表示美國不致設法使倫敦白銀協定續訂、此訊傳出後、聞倫敦銀價已大跌、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］財政部人員對於倫敦銀價之暴落、似未注意、豫料市况不日卽可平復、同時財長摩根索表示、美財部將繼續維持其目前白銀政策、並暗示財部購銀計畫、不致放棄、此間人士皆以為、美國銀價較世界價格略高、仍有繼續維持之機會、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］印度市場與投機家、因恐一九三三年白銀協定不再續訂、並恐中國被迫出售現存倫敦之大批自銀、故今日紛將白銀售出、致銀價由十九便士八七五落至十八便士八七五、惟大多數售出成單、皆限價十九便士、價格跌至十九便士以下時、卽經收回、故在限定價格所成之交易、為數適中、儘最高價售出之成單、均經空方補進者吸收、價格限定後、市况卽甚沉寂、售者皆意存觀望、據許多方面之意見、今日銀價跌落過分、須知美國儲銀極巨、决不容世界銀價跌落太低也、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］保守黨議員克萊文愛理斯今日在下院建議、政府應考慮採取一種政策、將黃金規定國際價格、每盎斯為一百四十先令、此非為圜幣價格之計畫、而為由國　淸理銀行解决貿易差量之一種貨品、蓋各國中央銀行皆為該銀行之一份子也、財政部財政司哥爾維爾答稱、政府並未商討此種計劃、財相西門對於其實行之可能、殊為滿意云、該議員又問財政部曾否考慮召集世界會議傳訂成國際圜幣公約否、哥氏答稱、如克氏對於該問題提出任何意見書、財部自當加以研究、但渠不能續有所答云、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］財長摩甘索今日聲稱、昨日宣布開募之聯邦公債與國庫券、應募業已逾額、公債超過原額十五倍、國庫券超過原額十一倍、其成繢之佳、為國庫歷史上所僅見云、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福總統頃自海特公園城返京之後、業已在內政策略上發現一種新因素、換言之、共和民主兩黨參議員中、各保守份子、不復以派別為念、其對于財政經濟政策、均堅决主張恢復正統理論、各該黨原有之黨紀、或因之而破壤、各政黨原有之陣容、或亦因而改觀、未可知也、按本屆國會開始以來、卽已佈滿疑慮之念、羅斯福總統雖聲明願與私營工商業合作、但某某方面仍以為經濟衰頹氣象、若長此遷延下去、則羅斯福總統或當加緊推行新政、以為補救之計咸皆為之不妥、雖然、關于政府願與私營工商業合作一層、羅斯福總統并無食言而肥之意、自可取信于人也云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>國際經濟之趨勢</h3>
<p>甲·全球貿易概况</p>
<p>據國聯統計月報十月號的研究、今年八月全世界貿易以金幣計算之價值、較上月减少百分之三、此種隨季節而增减的現象難成習慣、但此次却因遠東的糾紛而益加顯著、此外、吾人尚難確定此種現象是否亦由於最近某幾種基本原料市場之疲玩使然、</p>
<p>在有統計的七十四國、其輸入總額、若以减值前之金元計算、則八月份較七月份約减少五千萬金元、特別是下列諸國為甚、計</p>
<p>乙·物價指數</p>
<p>好幾種原料及重要糧食品、從今年三月開始跌價以來、市場益復不振、</p>
<p>糧食品方面的跌價、比較的尚不甚利害、</p>
<p>在織造的原料品當中、棉花已缺至一年前的價格、羊毛和絲則所跌較少、至於人造絲在春末以至於今、價格無甚變動、建築的木材及製紙的木漿版、在去年曾經大漲其價、今年過去數月、所跌亦微、</p>
<p>橡樹膠及幾種基本礦金屬的價格、‘如銅·錫·鉛·鋅等’在去秋至今、春漲價最快的東西、現在亦跌得最利害、但仍維持較高於去年六月的價格、</p>
<p>丙·儲金數量</p>
<p>全球各國各中央銀行的儲金量、在今年上半年繼續增加之後、七八兩月約减少一萬五千萬舊金元之譜、但至九月底、形勢又見好轉、除蘇俄·義大利西班牙缺乏經常的情報外、各國儲金量俱有增加、但比較今年六月底之總數、仍低减五千六百萬金元、</p>
<p>前項儲金之减少量、自六月底至九月底、其在各國之分配情形約如下、（單位金元）</p>

<h3>日本的戰時經濟</h3>
<p>— Quenther　Stein隅譯</p>
<p>兩月半對華軍事的勝利，引起了日本嚴重的經濟問題。近衛交麽幾日前所謂“近代戰爭的結果，不但决定於武力的優勢，並且要看經濟的力量，加强經濟的力量乃爲應付目前局勢所必需”，這句話實含有至理。講到這一層，很明顯的日本對於未來，已感覺焦慮了；尤其是在中國戰事不如其最初預料那般容易以及日本國內人士認爲日俄戰爭祇不過一時間問題以後。</p>
<p>日本目前最主要之焦慮乃其國外貿易的管理是也。雖則日本對於食料，可以自足，她却依賴世界市塲，供給其將近百分之七十的原料；並且擴張其軍火工業及其有聯帶關係工業的機器；也需要國際市塲供給：此外還有許多海陸軍以及國內製造商爲應付未來戰爭需要所必　的外國專利貨物，亦須依賴世界市塲。日本的輸出，不問其怎樣减低價格，早已爲了努力擴充軍備的原故，不能抵補其所訂的進口貨。爲平衡入超而用的國外流動凖備金，在去年年初，就已吿聲。五分之一以上的國內金凖備在後幾個月也用去了。就一般地講，經濟上必須激烈减低其進口，然而中日衝突却祇有使之提高；世界市塲價格的高漲，益使之日趨困難。</p>
<p>在現在這樣進口與出口不平衡的速度下，日本的金凖備决不能維持十二個月以上。嚴格限制人民的消耗——大部分爲必需品如棉花羊毛皮革等，必如早已禁止入口的奢侈品一樣，被摒於入口貨內——也許可以多維持幾月，但决不能再超過這以上。關於這一方面所探用的辦法，日政府也不敢放手做去，因爲這樣一來，恐怕　　工業，以及供給國內市塲消耗的工業，同受打擊，而使隱伏的社會問題，因生活費的急速提高，更趨尖銳。</p>
<p>至於進口貨物的國外長期信用借款，根本毫無希望，日本從事戰事的人，也不願爲獲得英美的好感，而對於在中國的行動，有所顧忌，這種行動，自使英美不快。他方面，卽使日本出口的賬目來往，照道理應無問題的，現在也變爲困難。日本報紙載倫敦消息，謂英國銀行界拒絕，至少有些遲疑，對於日本出口貨的貼現，或接受出口貨的票據，這使東京大阪的商業界吃驚不小，他們覺得，這事正如大阪每日新聞所說一樣，“這樣一個尷尬的情形，眞是沒有適當的方法可以應付”。差不多有百分之八十出口票據，普通是由倫敦市塲貼現或接收的。這樣看來，倫敦對於日本的冷淡，或是使東京關於許閣森事件的解决，最後不得不取比較和解的態度。最主要原因之一。至少在一部分的日本人看來，倫敦貼現市塲實際或者可能的困難，可歸入普遍的反日情緒與特殊的飛機槍傷駐華大使許閣森這兩方面。在別一部分人看來，主要的原因，還是在英國人估量日本財政與經濟情形太壤的原故。但上述兩種情形，都被日人視爲英國“缺乏明瞭”日本的眞意與實際情形。爲消除這種國外“錯懊的印像一”、日本認爲有派遣親善使節至英國及其他國家的必要。</p>
<p>可是日本財政的情形，不能否認，是向危險的方面發展。最初二次“中國事件”的特別軍費，將本年度的總支出達五，五○○，○○○，○○○日金，這數目比之最初預算，高出百分之九十，比之一九三六—三七年度實際開支高出百分之一三八，比之一九三一—三二年的所謂“滿洲事件”的預算，高出百分之三一一，差不多要有三，四○○，○○○，○○○日金要發赤字公債來抵補，這巨大的數目，要等於過去四年所發公債的總數，這四年當中，其中三分之一的國家預算，已是從借貸而來。就國債而講，在一九一四年，只有二十五億，一九三二年，六十二億，至今年三月底達一百十億，至明年三月，則恐至少將達一百四十四億。差不多所有的新赤字公債，都將在本年會計年度幾個月內發行，由於銀行界巳不能供應大量資本與軍火工業家及急需資本的聯帶工業，以供發展之用，而他方面，在日本又無投資的大衆—日本銀行，在大量通貨膨脹的危險情形之下，就得購進公債，藏於庫中，以爲新公債的凖備，而最後必至增加鈔票的發行。</p>
<p>再次我們講到日本經濟的國家統制，在平時統制巳很强像日本那樣的國家，並不能希望有顯著的効果。這對於海陸軍又一失望與引起不安的另一原因。日本從事戰爭者不能完全控制戰時經濟機構有兩方面的原因。第一個原因，他們忙於戰事問題，而對於工業方面，財政方面，貿易方面亳無知識。除此而外，組織優良大公司及好多工商業團體，也不願將其產業交付國家管理。日本經濟組織的解體，或國內的分化，在目前皆極危險，爲了這原因，九月初國會特別會議中，戰時經濟的條例，是一種調和性質，而稍爲限制了一些資本家企業的自由。</p>
<p>不用講，日本政府從國會中獲得某種自由處置的權力，但只限於維持日金匯兌以及嚴格供給基金於軍火工業方面的發展。至於整個的經濟政策，至少在目前，還只能辦到經濟界有力人物自願地與政府合作這一原則。講到對中國的戰爭，海陸軍方面至少已有這樣感覺，他們現在可以靠賴那些一直反對着軍人的商業領袖了。因爲雖則那些在戰爭開始的時候，他們反對戰爭，但现在他们在中國的損失很大，他們未來投資與市塲的危險很尖銳，因此他們却走上不得不與主戰者共其命運了（譯自字林報）</p>

<h3>After Our Forces Retreated from Zijin Mountain, Fierce Battles Unfolded in the Suburbs of Nanjing</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Left Nanjing by Plane Yesterday Morning; All City Gates of the Capital Were Closed Last Night; We Began to Destroy Armories and Airfields</p>
<p>[Hankou] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek left Nanjing by plane this morning, destination unknown. It is widely believed he has arrived in Nanchang. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to news received here from China, Japanese naval, land, and air forces jointly launched a general offensive on Nanjing and Wuhu this morning. This is a continuation of the Japanese army's occupation of Zijin Mountain last night. Tang Shengzhi, the Garrison Commander of Nanjing, ordered all city gates to be closed last night. He had previously advised all foreign residents in Nanjing to evacuate. Therefore, except for a few foreign journalists, all foreign residents had left Nanjing by 1:00 PM yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The capital, in its long history, is about to fall into foreign hands for the first time. Chinese defending forces have begun the systematic destruction of armories, gasoline engines, aircraft hangars, and factories, starting today. All damaged aircraft that cannot be repaired immediately will also be destroyed today. However, all intact aircraft left Nanjing this morning, flying to bases in the interior. According to unconfirmed reports, the Chinese army may set fire to the city, including magnificent government buildings and residential areas, before withdrawing. Chinese military authorities, to prevent the Japanese army from using them as cover, plan to burn down all buildings at key military points in Nanjing. Fires have already broken out in three places. Meanwhile, Chinese military authorities have adopted strict measures to curb looting. It is reported that six suspected looters have been executed by firing squad, four near the train station and two by the river. More than one hundred others have been arrested outside the city. This morning, as a Taikoo Tugboat was leaving the Jardine Matheson pontoon, two Chinese soldiers in a small boat tried to stop it. The tugboat ignored them and continued to sail forward. The Chinese soldiers then fired several shots at it, but the British on board were all lying on the deck, so no one was injured. Since the Japanese bombing of Wuhu, British ships no longer sail upstream. Wuhu was attacked by Japanese aircraft several times today. A Taikoo warehouse was hit by a bomb, but there have been no reports of foreign casualties. The Japanese army is now gradually approaching the outskirts of Nanjing. Residents in the city are now taking refuge in the safety zone. The International Committee has asked the Japanese side not to fight in the safety zone. The committee sent a letter to the Japanese authorities today, stating that the Chinese authorities have already withdrawn military institutions and troops from the safety zone, so the committee is currently handling the demarcation of the area. It hopes that the Japanese side will not bomb the area. The letter expressed appreciation for the Japanese authorities' statement that the Japanese army does not intend to attack places where no troops are stationed and where no military institutions are located. It also stated that there are 15 to 20 foreigners in the area, ready to take charge of administrative matters within the area. The French warship Charnier sailed upstream at 12:30 PM today, presumably heading to Wuhu. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Fiercely Attacking Nanjing from Three Directions</h3>
<p>Foreign sources say that the Japanese army's offensive against Greater Nanjing has been confirmed to be in three directions. One is from north of Jurong, bypassing to the north of Tangshui Township, the back of Jiuhua Mountain, and attacking our Qilinmen along small roads. This route has a total of about two regiments. The second is from Tianwang Temple, 22 kilometers directly south of Jurong, attacking Chunhua Township, 12 kilometers east and southeast of our Guanghuamen, along the stone road. This route has about three regiments and a mechanized corps, which seems to be the main force of the Japanese army, launching a very fierce attack. Yesterday, a large number of aircraft took turns bombing to aid their offensive. Our army has moved north from the Hushu Township, 10 kilometers south of Chunhua, and is confronting the Japanese army south of Chunhua Township. Last night, dozens of Japanese advance troops were killed there, and more than twenty rifles and several flags and documents were seized. The third line of the Japanese army's advance is from Lishui in the north, with a force of about two regiments. Our army fought fiercely with the Japanese army at Molingguan on the third and fourth days. Yesterday, it moved north and is now confronting the Japanese army five or six kilometers southwest of Yinxiang Township, north of Molingguan. There was no fierce fighting today. The advancing routes of the Japanese army are all blocked by our basic forces defending Greater Nanjing. Any further advance will require significant sacrifices.</p>
<h3>Foreign Residents Remaining in Nanjing Have Boarded Gunboats</h3>
<p>[Hankou] The great battle for the Chinese capital is now imminent. According to sources here, the Japanese army has reached a point near Molingguan on the Yangtze River, forming a semi-encirclement of Nanjing. There are 300,000 Chinese troops in the suburbs of Nanjing, 200,000 of whom are local troops. All fortifications have been prepared. All facts show the government's determination to defend the capital. The Chinese side has a considerable advantage in terrain, as the capital is surrounded by mountains, such as Qixia Mountain, Zijin Mountain, and Tangshan, standing outside the city. The Japanese army must first destroy the defenses of these mountains before it can occupy the capital. "Resist Japan to the last drop of blood" is the slogan of the 14th Division outside Nanjing. As for life in the city, although the level of tension is increasing day by day, people believe that the arrival of a great war is inevitable sooner or later, so they are at ease and not panicking. The streets in the city are full of military facilities, and government offices are also guarded by troops. Machine guns have been set up in the windows. Martial law has been declared in the city and the vicinity of Nanjing, and military law is being enforced. The last fifty foreign residents remaining in Nanjing have also evacuated and boarded gunboats, anchored three miles upstream of Nanjing. The sound of artillery fire from the suburbs of Nanjing can be heard clearly there. There are still twelve Germans remaining in Nanjing, including embassy officials and church staff, but ships have been prepared, and they can board them and head west as soon as the situation becomes critical. (National Maritime Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>Nanjing will be unofficially declared a combat zone starting from the 8th. All residents not involved in the military defense of Nanjing must enter the refugee zone and are not allowed to leave freely. At the same time, no one will be allowed to pass through the streets unless they have a yellow garrison badge and the correct password.</p>
<h3>Artillery Fire Clearly Heard Outside Zhongshan Gate</h3>
<p>Foreign sources say that over a thousand Japanese troops who bypassed Jurong to attack our Qilinmen from the back of Jiuhua Mountain were cut off by us at Mengtang, five or six li north of Tangshui Township. Another unit of our defending forces east of Qilinmen surrounded and annihilated the Japanese troops. The reporter drove to the front line to observe the battle at 1:30 PM on the 7th. After exiting Zhongshan Gate, loud artillery fire was immediately heard coming from the northeast, along with dense gunfire mixed in. On both sides of the asphalted Jinghang National Road outside Zhongshan Gate, our loyal and brave fresh troops were rushing to the front one after another. From the car, I could see smoke and fire soaring into the sky from the beautiful buildings of the Lingyuan New Village. At first, I was surprised and suspected that the Japanese soldiers had arrived or that traitors had set the fire. After inquiring with the sentries along the way, I learned that it was our army voluntarily burning them. Passing Xiaolingwei Street, I saw that the houses on both sides had been burned down, leaving only the broken walls and ruins that we needed most for defensive warfare standing tall. Ten minutes after the car arrived at a certain place, knowing it was the location of one of our armies, I got out of the car to visit the military commander. According to him, the situation of our army has improved because one of our armies has advanced from the northwest and directly north to take a pincer attack against the Japanese army behind Tangshan.</p>
<h3>We Have Deployed Heavy Troops to Firmly Defend Wuhu</h3>
<p>Although the Japanese army's advance from Lishui and Jintan to Jurong has been repeatedly defeated by the Chinese army in this area, it has not been deterred in the slightest. According to explanations here, this is because the Japanese military headquarters has decided that in any case, it must hold on to the places it has advanced to. At the same time, the Japanese army's progress is also quite slow, which shows that the Japanese army intends to consolidate its occupied areas before launching a large-scale attack on Nanjing in conjunction with the navy. The Japanese army's progress in the Wuhu area has also been hindered because China has stationed a large army there. Wuhu is located to the west of the capital. If Wuhu falls, Nanjing will be in a position to be attacked from both sides. Therefore, the Chinese side is firmly defending Wuhu. Defending Wuhu is defending Nanjing. It is believed here that if Wuhu unfortunately falls, the fall of Nanjing will inevitably follow. (National News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Also Claims Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>The Domei News Agency reported that the Japanese units of Izasa, Shimosada, Fuji, Wakisaka, etc., which occupied Jintan, have advanced to the south of Jurong. On the 5th, they even broke through Suoshe Township in the rear of Jurong. At 10:00 AM on the 6th, they reached Qinglong Mountain and continued to attack, and by noon they had advanced to a place about 5 kilometers southeast of Nanjing. On the other hand, the Japanese units of Okamoto, Takeshita, etc., which were advancing fiercely from Guangde, occupied Ningguo on the afternoon of the 5th and continued to advance rapidly, reaching the banks of the Yangtze River in Wuhu and advancing towards Wuhu. The Japanese units of Nagano, Yamada, Hasegawa, Okamoto, etc., which were advancing towards Wuhu, occupied Shuiyang Township and advanced to Yaotou, about 15 kilometers from Wuhu, this morning. Fierce battles are still ongoing. In addition, the Japanese units of Chiba, Yamada, Yamazaki, Yamamoto, etc., which were attacking Lishui, aimed to attack the rear of Nanjing. They reached the Chinese army's strong defense line at Molingguan this morning and are still attacking fiercely. Also, the Japanese units of Adachi, Nagatsu, Asama, etc., in the northern battlefront, used a small force to encircle and attack the Zhenjiang fortress, while most of them continued to advance towards Nanjing along the river since yesterday. Therefore, extremely fierce battles have broken out in various places.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Army Department of the General Headquarters announced at noon on the 7th that the first-line units of the Japanese army attacking Nanjing had occupied the official defense lines of the Chinese army, such as Qixia Mountain (about 18 kilometers east of Nanjing), Qinglong Mountain (about 8 kilometers northeast of Nanjing), and Fangshan (about 15 kilometers southeast of Nanjing), by this morning, the 7th of this month. The posture for attacking Nanjing has been completed. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>The Domei News Agency reported that the Japanese military authorities announced at noon on the 7th that the first-line units of the Japanese army had occupied the capital defense line from Qixia City (18 li northeast of Zijin Mountain) to Fangshan (24 li southeast of Nanjing) this morning.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bombing Nanjing</h3>
<p>Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangdong-Hankou Railways Bombed; Tongguan and Chaoyi Also Attacked</p>
<p>The Domei News Agency reported from Shanghai on the 7th that the Japanese Naval Air Corps departed from its base this morning, crossed the ocean, and flew to Nanjing to bomb the Chinese army's positions. Before long, the Army Air Corps units of Nonaka, Taki, Kanzaki, and Kawamura also appeared in the skies over Nanjing, coordinated with the naval aircraft, and dropped many bombs. The sound of the exploding bombs shook the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] There were almost eight air raid alarms here today. A reporter from the Associated Press witnessed one of the Japanese air raids. At that time, there were as many as seventeen Japanese planes bombing the Xiaguan and Pukou train stations. More than a dozen bombs were dropped at once, causing many deaths and injuries among the refugees. At this time, the American ship Panay was anchored along the Yangtze River in Pukou. Because the Chinese side's anti-aircraft guns were firing fiercely at the Japanese planes, the Americans on board all put on helmets to protect themselves from stray bullets. When the Japanese planes were bombing, the ships along the river had already fled empty. The remaining small boats, steamers, and civilian boats all took refuge next to foreign gunboats, using them as cover. More than two thousand refugees had gathered in the open space of the train station in advance. After the Japanese planes dropped bombs, corpses were piled up around the tracks, a horrific sight. One coolie was lying among them, struggling to raise his powerless arm, trying to put out the raging fire burning his clothes, but finally failed and was burned to death. The survivors of the bombing mostly cried out and wailed, going in and out of the piles of corpses, looking for their parents, children, relatives, and friends. The reporter also saw a woman holding a child, trying to drag her husband who had died beside her, but to no avail. The reporter only saw a glimpse of this tragic situation; the rest he no longer had the courage to view. (National News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] On the 7th, seventeen Japanese planes bombed the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangdong-Hankou Railways twice in the morning and afternoon.

<h3>Approximately One Thousand Killed and Wounded in Bombing of Wuhu</h3>
<p>Refugees Waiting for Ships Suffered Greatly</p>
<p>Foreign sources say that when Japanese planes bombed Wuhu at noon on the 5th, approximately one thousand Chinese people were killed and wounded. At that time, a large number of refugees were gathered at the Wuhu docks, waiting for ships to go west. The Taikoo ship Datong just happened to arrive, and the crowd flocked to the Taikoo pontoon, because the pontoon and the Datong ship were both painted with large British flags, and the refugees thought that the Japanese planes would be able to see that they were British ships and that they would be very safe. However, after the Japanese planes dropped three bombs on the Wuhu train station, they continued to drop three bombs on the docks. The first bomb landed on the Taikoo pontoon, killing and burning a large number of refugees on board. Over three or four hundred people drowned while trying to jump into the Datong. Before long, the Dehe, which was docked twenty yards away, was also hit by a bomb, and the entire ship was destroyed, with another four or five hundred people killed and wounded. The third bomb landed on the front of the Datong. Although the ship did not sink, many refugees were killed and wounded. The British warship Gnat was hit by shrapnel. When Japanese planes flew over Wuhu again yesterday and today, the ship used anti-aircraft guns to drive them away. After this major disaster in Wuhu, shops and residents have moved away.</p>

<h3>Japan Holds Emergency Meeting to Discuss New China Policy</h3>
<p>England and Related Countries Continue to Negotiate; U.S. Neutrality Act Awaits Presidential Decision</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to well-informed sources here today, the Japanese government may, after the capture of Nanjing, publish a statement rescinding recognition of the Nanjing government. The cabinet will hold a meeting to decide on this matter as soon as it receives a formal report from General Matsui, commander of the Japanese forces stationed in Shanghai. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Konoe urgently convened a meeting of relevant cabinet ministers at his official residence at 2:20 PM on the 7th. Foreign Minister Hirota, who had left at 1:30 PM to attend a councilors' informal meeting, returned to the prime minister's official residence at 2:10 PM. With the prime minister at the center, Army Minister Sugiyama and Navy Minister Yonai, who were attending the councilors' informal meeting, gathered in another room, and important discussions were held on the direction of the meeting. (Domei, 7th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] As the focus of the war in Central China is now approaching Nanjing, the Japanese government is suddenly becoming tense and plans to convene an emergency cabinet meeting soon to decide on important policies to be adopted by the Japanese government. It is generally believed that the fall of Nanjing marks a major stage in the current war. Even if the Chinese government becomes a local government after Nanjing falls, its resistance will not necessarily cease. At the same time, the mediation efforts and movements of various European and American countries are gradually becoming more active, which is not difficult to imagine. When the Japanese government holds cabinet meetings, it often considers these various factors, examines the countermeasures that Japan should take, and in order to achieve its goals and end the war as soon as possible, issues an important statement clarifying the Japanese government's policy. The content of the statement may be determined by a joint meeting of the government and the General Headquarters. (Domei, 7th)</p>

<p>[London] Conservative Member of Parliament Adam asked in the House of Commons today whether, since the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has not been effective and British territories are facing danger, any member states of the League of Nations intend to unite with the United States to promote practical measures of oppression against aggressors in the Far East. Foreign Minister Eden refused to acknowledge that British territories are facing danger and said that international consideration of the Far East problem is continuing, but the outcome cannot be predicted. However, he dared to inform the House of Commons that the British government is currently consulting with the governments of the main countries concerned on all matters. Adam then asked that any suggestions agreed upon by the British Foreign Office be communicated to Parliament as soon as possible. Labor MP Belenger asked the Foreign Minister whether multilateral action is currently without hope. The Foreign Minister replied, "I do not wish to say that." The Foreign Minister continued, "Our actions must depend on the attitude of other countries with significant interests in the Far East. This has already been stated to the House of Commons." (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Minister Eden replied to a question from Labor MP Belenger in the House of Commons today, stating that the treaties signed between China and Britain cannot be changed due to the Sino-Japanese War.

The Foreign Minister replied, "Belenger might allow me to say that it would be better not to discuss general issues at this time." (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull, regarding the U.S. policy toward the Sino-Japanese War, replied to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today that the implementation of the Neutrality Act must await President Roosevelt's declaration that a state of war already exists.

<p>[London] Regarding the visit of Viscount Ishii, a member of the Japanese Privy Council, to England, diplomatic circles here recently stated that it is not yet known what proposals Viscount Ishii intends to present to Britain regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute. However, Britain does not intend to propose mediation to Japan, so as not to de facto demand China's surrender. The discussions held yesterday between Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, and Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota did not mention this aspect. What was emphasized was the issue of how British interests in China should be protected. Regarding this, observers here all said that the Japanese government apparently issued a statement in the middle of last week, stating that British interests in China have not been threatened, and Japan has no intention of coveting Hong Kong. Therefore, the British government has not yet dispatched additional troops to China. However, if Japan's ambitions expand, the British government will certainly dispatch additional troops to the Far East. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>Washington The House Foreign Affairs Committee recently questioned the State Department regarding the U.S. attitude towards the China Incident. Secretary of State Hull replied in writing, stating, "The U.S. government is still making every effort to gradually withdraw U.S. citizens from China. Applications from U.S. citizens for passports to travel to China are generally rejected unless there are special circumstances. However, U.S. exporters are still continuing to supply military goods to both China and Japan. These transactions are generally conducted with cash and not on credit. However, according to current laws, exporters have no need to specify this, so it is impossible to determine." (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Limit on Japanese Foreign Exchange Remittance</h3>
<p>Reduced to 100 Yen</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Ministry of Finance held a meeting of the Foreign Exchange Control Committee on the afternoon of the 6th to discuss the reduction of the limit on import remittances and the revision of the Foreign Exchange Control Law. The following draft revisions to the Ministry of Finance ordinances on cracking down on overseas assets were agreed upon. The Foreign Exchange Control Committee will hold a meeting on the 9th to formally decide on the following: 1) The limit on import remittances will be reduced from the current 1,000 yen per month to 100 yen. However, to avoid complications, the processing of permits for amounts under 1,000 yen will be handled by the Foreign Exchange Control Bureau of the Bank of Japan. 2) Regarding the revised provisions on cracking down on overseas assets, the disposal of securities overseas will be subject to permission, remittances related to insurance will be subject to permission, and reports must be submitted on increases and decreases in assets overseas and the asset status of businesses and operations. Furthermore, reports must be submitted on the details of reciprocal accounting between residents of foreign countries. (Domei, 7th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Explains Hong Kong's Status</h3>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today that the incidents discussed between the Hong Kong government and the Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong did not concern the political activities of Chinese leaders in Hong Kong. The only incident raised by the Japanese Consul-General with the Hong Kong government was that Chinese laborers loading and unloading goods on Japanese ships had received threatening letters. Therefore, the Japanese newspapers' claim that the Japanese Consul-General had said that Hong Kong might be drawn into the Sino-Japanese War is clearly unsubstantiated. Labor Party members immediately questioned what action the British had taken in response to the Japanese protests. Eden replied that this involved only a very small incident and that the protests received had been handed over to the police authorities. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Shanghai Post Office</h3>
<p>[London] In the British House of Commons today, questions were raised about the status of foreign submarine cable companies and the Chinese Post Office in Shanghai.

At the same time, the British side is currently consulting with the governments of the countries concerned. He also stated that the work of the Chinese Post Office in Shanghai has not been interfered with by the Japanese, and no Japanese inspectors have been sent there. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>British Government Determines to Uphold Rights in Case of Japanese Aircraft Bombing British Ship in Wuhu</h3>
<p>Currently Investigating and Deciding on Countermeasures; British Ambassador to Japan Lodges Protest with Japan</p>
<p>[London] Responsible sources in London have firmly stated that the British government has absolutely and fully decided to uphold British rights and interests in the case of Japanese aircraft bombing two British ships in Wuhu on Sunday. The entire case is currently under close investigation. The authorities must await detailed reports received from the London Admiralty to clarify all the circumstances before deciding on countermeasures. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that, according to official sources in this city yesterday, the British government is likely to protest the bombing of the British ships "Tuck Wo" and "Ta Tung", which were docked in Wuhu on Sunday, by Japanese aircraft. It is also understood that, regardless of what action the government takes, the British naval authorities will also protest the fact that the British gunboat "Gnat" was hit by shrapnel from Japanese bombs, injuring its commander, Major Barrow. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. claimed that the chief engineer of the "Ta Tung", Morris, was injured in the arm, and the stern of the "Tuck Wo" was hit near the stern, and that many passengers were likely to have died. The Shanghai Times has learned that the British Consul in this city will not take any action regarding this case, as Wuhu is within the Nanjing consular district, and it is difficult for the Nanjing consulate to take formal action in the current situation. Since Wuhu is not within the Shanghai consular district, the British Consul-General in Shanghai will also not lodge a direct protest. However, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. will ask the British Consul-General to forward the details of this case to the British government. It is said that the British naval authorities have considered this matter and are still studying the information on the case. The British Consul-General informed the Japanese Consul-General by telephone on Sunday of the fact that two British ships in Wuhu had been bombed and the commander of the British gunboat had been injured. Although no foreigners were killed on the two ships, it is believed that many Chinese passengers must have died, either from being hit by bombs or from jumping into the river when the "Tuck Wo" caught fire. When a Japanese military spokesman met with newspaper reporters yesterday, he replied that the Japanese authorities had not yet received details of the case. The spokesman also said that Japanese aircraft had bombed Chinese troops in and around Wuhu. According to eyewitness accounts, there were 30,000 Chinese troops near the port. When asked whether the commander of the British gunboat had stated that there were no Chinese troops near the two ships when they were bombed that day, the spokesman said that Japanese aircraft were bombing Chinese troops crossing the river on civilian ships. When further inquiries were made, the spokesman indicated that he did not wish to continue commenting on the matter.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that yesterday afternoon, Vice Admiral Leith, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, lodged a protest with the Japanese naval commander regarding the bombing of the two British ships and the British gunboat in Wuhu by Japanese aircraft. The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that the British Ambassador in Tokyo had received instructions from his government to lodge a protest directly with the Japanese government regarding the bombing of British ships in Wuhu by Japanese aircraft. As for the details of the case, they are still being investigated by the British naval authorities in China. Vice Admiral Leith, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, lodged a protest with the Japanese naval commander regarding this case, but the Japanese side has not yet responded.</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Army Blockades Coast</h3>
<p>British Statement of Non-Recognition</p>
<p>[London] General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, recently presented a note announcing the blockade of the territorial waters under the jurisdiction of the government forces and the laying of mines inside and outside the territorial waters. This note has been replied to by the British government, stating that the Nationalist government has not been recognized as a belligerent group, and the British government does not recognize its right to declare a blockade. Therefore, British ships sailing to ports belonging to the Spanish government forces can still enjoy the protection of the British Navy. As for the laying of mines, according to Article 8 of the Hague International Convention, the laying of mines inside and outside the enemy's territorial waters for the sole purpose of cutting off commercial shipping is prohibited. Therefore, even if the Nationalist army has been recognized as a belligerent group, this act of laying mines would violate international law. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>[London] The Subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War met this morning to discuss the replies from both sides of the Spanish Civil War regarding the withdrawal of foreign volunteers and the recognition of belligerent groups. Diplomatic sources stated that the subcommittee's discussions concluded that the replies from both sides of the Spanish Civil War were in principle accepting the recommendations of the Adjustment Committee. However, the delegations from Germany and Italy believed that the Spanish Republican government's reply was tantamount to formally refusing to recognize the belligerent groups in the Spanish Civil War. Conversely, the delegations from other countries believed that the Nationalist army's proposal that both sides of the civil war withdraw 3,000 foreign volunteers each before recognizing both sides as belligerent groups was difficult to accept.

<p>Portugal's Capital, Lisbon The Portuguese government recently issued a communiqué stating that since Portugal has significant interests in Spain and has long maintained cordial relations with the Nationalist army government, in order to increase the effectiveness of Portugal's diplomatic representation, it has appointed a special envoy to reside in the Nationalist army government to develop common interests and express the goodwill of the Portuguese nation. The Minister of Commerce, Dr. Teixera de Sampayo, will assume this position. At the same time, the Nationalist government is being notified to send a special envoy to reside in Portugal.

<h3>Japanese Consul Did Not Know About the Great Eastern Hotel Incident</h3>
<p>Statement Made to the Chairman of the Municipal Council; Steps Taken to Prevent Similar Incidents</p>
<p>The Japanese Consul-General has stated to the Chairman of the Municipal Council that he had no prior knowledge of the case that occurred at the Great Eastern Hotel on Monday, and that steps have been taken to prevent similar incidents from happening again.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 7th A dispatch reports that after Japanese police illegally arrested Chinese people in the Shanghai International Settlement yesterday, the local Municipal Council protested to the Japanese authorities. British political figures expressed their support upon hearing the news, saying that Japanese police can only exercise their powers over their own nationals.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that it was learned last night that the Municipal Council held an emergency meeting to discuss the case of Japanese people entering the Great Eastern Hotel yesterday morning to arrest four Chinese people at gunpoint, and will immediately lodge a protest with the leading consuls. When a spokesman for the Japanese embassy met with newspaper reporters yesterday afternoon, he said that he only learned about the matter after reading the newspapers. The spokesman also answered many questions, insisting that he did not know the actual situation. However, he believed that the arrest of the four Chinese people was not related to the four demands mentioned in the evening newspapers. When asked whether his answer meant that the Japanese authorities did not have the right to enter the International Settlement and take what they considered necessary actions, the spokesman replied that he did not wish to continue answering until he received more details.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that, although the Japanese side claimed that the "kidnapping" of the four Chinese people at the Great Eastern Hotel was due to "extreme urgency" and that they did not have time to obtain permission from the authorities of the International Settlement, foreign consuls are paying close attention to this case today. It is said that even in cases of extreme urgency, there is no legal basis for handing over Chinese residents of the International Settlement to the Japanese authorities. Chinese people have no obligation to be loyal to Japan and cannot be accused of betraying Japan. If they commit crimes of anti-Japanese activity, the Municipal Council should prosecute them in court. Military occupation does not apply to the International Settlement. Today (7th), a senior official of the Municipal Council stated that the Japanese cannot argue in this case that they have taken over the governing power of the Shanghai Municipal Government, because the Municipal Council has always allowed the Chinese authorities to arrest people in the International Settlement. At the beginning of the war, the Municipal Government attempted to arrest several so-called traitors, but they were rescued by the Municipal Council Police Department. Therefore, the Police Department placed patrols on the border of the settlement to prevent people from being forcibly taken out. If the Chinese authorities provide evidence of treason, the settlement authorities will arrest and hand over the suspects to the Municipal Government by name.</p>
<p>The Consular Body held a meeting yesterday afternoon to consider the "kidnapping" case, but it is not yet known what action will be taken. According to important officials of the Municipal Council, if the Japanese can enter the International Settlement to arrest people at any time, then no Chinese people or foreigners with consular jurisdiction in the settlement will be safe. It is now known that those who entered the Great Eastern Hotel yesterday morning to arrest the four Chinese people were army police, and it was initially thought that they were police from the Japanese consulate.</p>
<p>When Japanese authorities met with newspaper reporters today to discuss this case, someone asked whether the Japanese authorities would be willing to cooperate with the International Settlement authorities in the future. The spokesman replied that this would depend on whether the Municipal Council Police Department took the necessary steps. If the Police Department can take the necessary steps, then this type of case will not be seen again in the future. The spokesman also denied long-standing rumors that the Japanese authorities had submitted a list of anti-Japanese elements to the Municipal Council or revealed the names of those the Japanese wanted to monitor.</p>
<h3>American and Canadian Workers Boycott Japanese Toys</h3>
<p>St. John, Canada The ship Duchess of Richmond, carrying 200 tons of Japanese goods, all Christmas toys and other items, was returned on the same ship after dockworkers in Southampton, England, refused to unload it. Today, Canadian dockworkers also refused to handle it. It is not known where the cargo is being sent. At the same time, it is reported that there are a total of 350 batches of Japanese goods in warehouses here, all Christmas toys and gifts. If they cannot be transported to England for sale, they will become obsolete. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3>Fluctuations in the World Silver Market</h3>
<p>U.S. Continues Silver Purchasing Policy; People Subscribe to Government Bonds, Exceeding the Original Amount by More Than Ten Times</p>
<p>Washington Someone asked Treasury Secretary Morgenthau whether the U.S. Treasury Department would continue to purchase silver. Secretary Morgenthau replied, "We are waiting for President Roosevelt's announcement." Official sources also stated that the United States would not seek to renew the London Silver Agreement. After this news spread, it was reported that silver prices in London had fallen sharply. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington Treasury officials do not seem to be paying attention to the sharp drop in silver prices in London, and they expect the market situation to recover soon. At the same time, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated that the U.S. Treasury Department will continue to maintain its current silver policy and hinted that the Treasury Department's silver purchasing plan would not be abandoned. People here generally believe that the U.S. silver price is slightly higher than the world price and there is still an opportunity to continue to maintain it. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>London The Indian market and speculators, fearing that the 1933 Silver Agreement would not be renewed and that China would be forced to sell its large stocks of silver in London, sold off silver today, causing the price of silver to fall from 19 7/8 pence to 18 7/8 pence. However, most of the sale orders were limited to a price of 19 pence, and they were recovered when the price fell below 19 pence. Therefore, the number of transactions made at the limited price was moderate. All sale orders sold at the highest price were absorbed by short covering. After the price was limited, the market situation became very quiet, and sellers were waiting to see what would happen. According to many sources, the silver price has fallen excessively today. It should be noted that the United States has huge silver reserves and will never allow the world silver price to fall too low. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>London Conservative MP Craven-Ellis suggested in the House of Commons today that the government should consider adopting a policy of setting an international price for gold at 140 shillings per ounce. This is not a plan for currency prices, but a commodity to be used by the Bank for International Settlements to settle trade imbalances, as the central banks of all countries are members of that bank. Financial Secretary Colville of the Treasury Department replied that the government had not discussed this plan, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon was not very satisfied with its feasibility. The MP also asked whether the Treasury Department had considered convening a world conference to sign an international currency convention. Colville replied that if Craven-Ellis submitted any opinions on this issue, the Treasury Department would study them, but he could not continue to answer. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced today that the federal bonds and treasury bills announced yesterday have been oversubscribed. The bonds exceeded the original amount by 15 times, and the treasury bills exceeded the original amount by 11 times. The success is unprecedented in the history of the Treasury Department.

<p>Washington After President Roosevelt returned to Washington, D.C. from Hyde Park, he discovered a new factor in domestic policy. In other words, conservative elements among senators from both the Republican and Democratic parties are no longer thinking in terms of factions. They firmly advocate restoring orthodox theories in fiscal and economic policies. The original party discipline of each party may be broken as a result, and the original alignment of each political party may also be changed as a result, which is unknown. It is said that since the beginning of this congressional session, it has been filled with doubts. Although President Roosevelt has stated that he is willing to cooperate with private industry and commerce, some quarters still believe that if the economic recession continues to drag on, President Roosevelt may intensify the implementation of the New Deal as a remedy, which is not appropriate for everyone. However, President Roosevelt has no intention of going back on his word regarding the government's willingness to cooperate with private industry and commerce, and he can be trusted in this regard.

<h3>International Economic Trends</h3>
<p>A. Global Trade Overview</p>
<p>According to a study in the October issue of the League of Nations' Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, the value of world trade in August this year, calculated in gold coins, decreased by 3% compared to the previous month. This seasonal increase and decrease is difficult to become a habit, but this time it is even more pronounced due to the disputes in the Far East. In addition, it is difficult for us to determine whether this phenomenon is also due to the recent weakness of the markets for certain basic raw materials.</p>
<p>In the 74 countries with statistics, the total value of imports, calculated in gold dollars before devaluation, decreased by approximately 50 million gold dollars in August compared to July, especially in the following countries:</p>
<p>B. Price Index</p>
<p>Since the price of several raw materials and important food crops began to fall in March this year, the market has become increasingly sluggish.</p>
<p>The price drop in food crops is relatively less severe.</p>
<p>Among the raw materials for weaving, cotton is now short of the price of a year ago, while wool and silk have fallen less. As for rayon, the price has not changed much from late spring to the present. The price of building timber and wood pulp for papermaking, which had risen sharply last year, has also fallen slightly in the past few months.</p>
<p>The prices of rubber and several basic minerals, such as copper, tin, lead, and zinc, which had risen the fastest from last autumn to this spring, have now also fallen the most severely, but they still remain higher than the prices of last June.</p>
<p>C. Gold Reserves</p>
<p>After the gold reserves of central banks around the world continued to increase in the first half of this year, they decreased by approximately 150 million old gold dollars in July and August. However, by the end of September, the situation had improved again. With the exception of the lack of regular information from Soviet Russia, Italy, and Spain, the gold reserves of all countries have increased. However, the total is still 56 million gold dollars lower than the total at the end of June this year.</p>
<p>The distribution of the aforementioned decrease in gold reserves from the end of June to the end of September is approximately as follows (unit: gold dollars):</p>

<h3>France-Poland Talks Conclude, Determined to Cooperate and Stabilize the Situation</h3>
<p>Complete Understanding on All Issues, Alliance Treaty Abides Without Change</p>
<p>⊙Krakow, Poland. French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos, along with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, has arrived here from Warsaw. Regarding the Franco-Polish talks, both sides have issued a communiqué, stating in essence that the two countries' diplomatic authorities, in a spirit of sincere cooperation, have submitted various issues concerning both parties, especially the maintenance of European peace, for discussion. It has been proven that both France and Poland adhere to the alliance treaty between the two countries, and their current diplomatic policies aim to develop peaceful relations between nations. In the future, both sides will be honest and trustworthy in all matters, working together to align with mutual interests, thereby achieving a general pacification and stabilizing the international situation. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>⊙Krakow, Poland. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck also delivered a speech at a reception held here, stating in essence, "The talks have been conducted in an atmosphere of mutual trust and complete understanding, which proves the lasting strength of the Franco-Polish alliance treaty." Foreign Minister Delbos responded by saying that Colonel Beck's words were exactly what he felt. He was very satisfied with this trip, and the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation had been seen in the talks. "The sincere affection of your country for ours is also evident. My contact with your country's authorities will surely contribute to the general situation in Europe," he said. Foreign Minister Delbos is scheduled to leave for the Romanian capital at 11:50 this morning, arriving around 8:00 tomorrow morning. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>⊙Krakow, Poland. French Foreign Minister Delbos, accompanied by Polish Foreign Minister Beck, arrived here from Warsaw last night. The two foreign ministers held their final talks in the car. It is reported that the discussion concerned the Polish colonial issue. Poland's request is based on two reasons: first, Poland needs raw materials; second, Poland's population continues to increase and must be resettled abroad. Beck declared to Delbos that Poland has no territorial ambitions, but if the countries concerned consider establishing companies with special privileges to undertake colonial work, Poland should be allowed to participate in the organization of these companies. If they consider relocating people from overpopulated countries to areas outside of Europe, Poland should not be forgotten. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Stabilizes Europe, America Expresses Welcome</h3>
<p>Resolution of European Situation Will Change the Far East Situation, Delbos Leaves Poland for Romania</p>
<p>[Washington] The visit of French Foreign Minister Delbos to various Central European countries has been closely watched by diplomatic circles here. Previously, when the British and French authorities held talks in London, they learned from reports sent by the diplomatic representatives of the United States stationed in the capitals of Britain and France that the opinions of Britain and France were completely consistent. Therefore, well-informed sources in the United States hope that European countries can establish a peaceful organization, allowing Britain and France to devote their energies to dealing with the Far East problem. Britain and France have recently been preoccupied with the Spanish issue and the situation in Central Europe, and cannot attend to the Far East. If the European problem can be resolved, the situation will naturally be different. According to responsible sources, during the London talks between Britain and France, the governments of both countries were very determined to form a stronger united front to oppose Germany's unreasonable demands. It is generally believed that Britain and France, after joint consideration, believe that the combined forces are extremely strong, while the so-called anti-communist united front is very fragile, so they adopted this attitude. However, it is a pity that when Davis, the representative of the United States to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, was in Beijing, Britain and France did not express this firm attitude. In Washington, most people, regardless of their faction, advocate that if any policy can restrain Japan's ambitions and resist the threat of European dictatorial countries to the unity of the Pan-American countries, the United States government should follow it. For this reason, American people hope that French Foreign Minister Delbos's trip will consolidate peace in Europe and allow Britain and France to shift their attention to the Far East. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Washington University held a Pan-American Conference yesterday, presided over by Under Secretary of State Welles at the opening ceremony. He listed in detail the propaganda activities carried out by some dictatorial countries in South America, stating, "Any attempt by countries outside the Americas to extend their influence, politically or materially, to the New World will cause great anxiety in the United States. Once all the republics of the Americas have consulted each other, they should decide on appropriate measures to deal with this situation." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>⊙Krakow, Poland. This morning, French Foreign Minister Delbos, accompanied by Polish Foreign Minister Beck, Polish Ambassador to France Łukasiewicz, and French Ambassador to Poland Noël, toured the streets of the city, especially the famous old churches and libraries. At 10:00 a.m., accompanied by Foreign Minister Beck and other dignitaries, he laid a wreath in front of the tomb of the late General Piłsudski, former Minister of Military Affairs. Then, at around 11:00 a.m., he took a car to the Romanian capital. Foreign Minister Beck personally went to the station to say goodbye. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>⊙Bucharest, Romania. French Foreign Minister Delbos is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow. The capital's railway station and various buildings have been decorated with the flags of Romania and France. The lively scene is rare compared to visits by foreign politicians in recent years. The French Foreign Minister is scheduled to meet with King Carol and also with Prime Minister Tătărescu, Foreign Minister Antonescu, and others. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Prime Minister Received by Pope</h3>
<p>Will Also Visit Germany in Return</p>
<p>[Berlin] Well-informed sources have announced that Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović will come to Berlin in the near future to return the visit of German Foreign Minister Neurath to Yugoslavia a few months ago. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>[Rome] After arriving here, Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović, accompanied by the country's minister to the Holy See, had an audience with Pope Pius XI this morning, and had a long conversation. He then visited Cardinal Pacelli, the Secretary of State of the Vatican. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović arrived here yesterday and, after meeting with Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano for an hour, Mussolini ordered the release of all Yugoslav political prisoners in Italian prisons as a sign of friendship between the two countries. It is said that Stojadinović will continue to meet with senior Italian officials before leaving Rome on Wednesday. When Stojadinović arrived here yesterday, the German and British ambassadors, the Czech minister, and the Romanian chargé d'affaires were at the station to welcome him, which shows the friendship between Yugoslavia and various countries. The area around the Rome railway station was full of flags and decorations to welcome him. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>[Rome] After arriving here, Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović has held talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano, and will continue to meet several more times before meeting with Pope Pius XI and returning to his country on the 10th of this month. According to reports, the talks between the Italian and Yugoslav authorities have three objectives: ㊀ Developing bilateral economic relations, or even establishing a permanent economic committee to handle economic cooperation. Regarding this, observers state that Italy recently concluded a new commercial agreement with Austria and Hungary, abolishing the economic privileges enjoyed by those countries under the Rome Protocols. Italy and Yugoslavia are now discussing economic cooperation at this time, and there is a noteworthy effect. ㊁ Discussing the general situation in the Mediterranean, including the issue of Yugoslavia recognizing the Spanish Nationalist government, which the Yugoslav government is said to have decided to do. ㊂ Jointly preventing communism, but without signing any agreement. In addition, Italian sources emphasize that the friendship treaty concluded between Italy and Yugoslavia in March of this year did not mention the League of Nations, which shows that Yugoslavia may not accept the current diplomatic methods of Germany and Italy. As for the anti-communist agreement between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Yugoslav government has not yet recognized the Soviet Union, and it is closer to viewing this agreement as harming other countries. However, well-informed sources in Yugoslavia say that the country will never join this agreement. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>British and American Financial Circles Prepare to Invest in Italy</h3>
<p>British Foreign Secretary and Italian Ambassador to Continue Talks</p>
<p>[London] Financial circles here have announced that British banks are now planning to lend funds to Italy to enable the country's industries to purchase raw materials and accelerate the development of Abyssinia. Foreign Secretary Eden recently met with Italian Ambassador Grandi for the first time, and may continue talks in the future, hoping to establish a Mediterranean agreement. At that time, mutual financial cooperation will naturally be easier to start. It is reported that major banks in Britain and the United States are closely monitoring the progress of diplomatic negotiations between Britain and Italy. Once the political situation clears up, they will establish financial transactions with Italy. Therefore, the joint visit of Ramon Lema, a key figure in the American Morgan Bank, and Femi, the company's representative in Italy, to Britain is related to this. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Number of Refugees Counted</h3>
<p>Nearly 100,000 People</p>
<p>According to a report from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department, as of the 6th of this month, there were 158 refugee shelters inspected by the department, accommodating a total of 95,336 refugees.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Trade Association Bans Discounting of Exchange Drafts for Cash</h3>
<p>Exchange Drafts Not Allowed to Be Cashed</p>
<p>After the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Silver and Money Trade Association to ban the discounting of exchange drafts for cash, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the two associations that the discounting of bills by members of the two associations was originally one of the business practices stipulated by the industry, referring to bills that had not yet matured. The circulation of exchange drafts was originally a suggestion from the two associations, with the aim of stabilizing the Shanghai financial market and preventing the outflow of cash. The regulations stipulated that exchange drafts between peers could not be cashed, and there were no incidents of members of the associations discounting exchange drafts for cash. After receiving the letters from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, all members have been notified to comply.</p>
<h3>Japan's Wartime Economy</h3>
<p>— Translated by Quenther Stein</p>
<p>The two and a half months of military victories against China have caused serious economic problems for Japan. A few days ago, Prince Konoe stated, "The outcome of modern warfare depends not only on the advantage of military power, but also on economic strength. Strengthening economic strength is necessary to cope with the current situation." This statement contains great truth. Speaking of this, it is obvious that Japan feels anxious about the future, especially after the war in China is not as easy as it initially expected and Japanese people believe that the Russo-Japanese War was only a temporary issue.</p>
<p>Japan's most pressing concern at present is the management of its foreign trade. Although Japan can be self-sufficient in food, it relies on the world market to supply nearly 70 percent of its raw materials; the expansion of its armaments industry and related industries; also needs the international market to supply machinery. In addition, there are many foreign patented goods that the navy, army, and domestic manufacturers need to prepare for future wars, and they must rely on the world market. Japan's exports, no matter how much they are reduced in price, have long been unable to offset the imports it has ordered due to its efforts to expand its military. The foreign exchange reserves used to balance the import surplus had already been exhausted at the beginning of last year. More than one-fifth of the domestic gold reserves were also used up in the following months. Generally speaking, economically it is necessary to drastically reduce imports, but the Sino-Japanese conflict has only increased them; the rise in world market prices has made it increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>At the current rate of imbalance between imports and exports, Japan's gold reserves cannot be maintained for more than twelve months. Strict restrictions on people's consumption—mostly necessities such as cotton, wool, and leather—must, like the luxury goods that have already been banned from import, be excluded from imports—perhaps this can be maintained for a few more months, but no more than that. The Japanese government does not dare to take drastic measures in this regard, because in this way, it is feared that the [ ] industry, as well as the industries that supply domestic market consumption, will be hit together, and the hidden social problems will become more acute due to the rapid increase in the cost of living.</p>
<p>As for long-term foreign credit loans for imported goods, there is no hope at all. Those in Japan who are engaged in war do not want to show any hesitation in their actions in China in order to gain the favor of Britain and the United States. Such actions naturally make Britain and the United States unhappy. On the other hand, even the accounts receivable from Japan's exports, which should be no problem in principle, have now become difficult. Japanese newspapers reported news from London that British banks refused, or at least hesitated, to discount Japanese export goods or accept export bills. This surprised the business community in Tokyo and Osaka. They felt that this matter, as the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun said, "is such an embarrassing situation that there is no appropriate way to deal with it." Nearly 80 percent of export bills are normally discounted or received by the London market. In this way, London's indifference to Japan may be one of the main reasons why Tokyo had to take a more conciliatory attitude towards the Huskisson incident in the end. At least in the eyes of some Japanese, the actual or possible difficulties in the London discount market can be attributed to the general anti-Japanese sentiment and the specific incident of the machine-gun wounding of Ambassador Huskisson in China. In the eyes of others, the main reason is still that the British estimate the financial and economic situation of Japan to be too bad. However, both of the above situations are regarded by the Japanese as Britain's "lack of understanding" of Japan's true intentions and actual situation. In order to eliminate this foreign "misunderstanding," Japan believes that it is necessary to send goodwill envoys to Britain and other countries.</p>
<p>However, Japan's financial situation, it cannot be denied, is developing in a dangerous direction. The special military expenses of the first two "China incidents" brought the total expenditure of this year to 5,500,000,000 yen. This number is 90 percent higher than the initial budget, 138 percent higher than the actual expenditure in 1936-37, and 311 percent higher than the budget for the so-called "Manchurian Incident" in 1931-32. Nearly 3,400,000,000 yen will have to be offset by issuing deficit public bonds. This huge number is equal to the total amount of public bonds issued in the past four years, during which one-third of the national budget has come from borrowing. As far as the national debt is concerned, in 1914, it was only 2.5 billion, in 1932, 6.2 billion, and by the end of March this year, it reached 11 billion. By March next year, it is feared that it will reach at least 14.4 billion. Almost all of the new deficit public bonds will be issued within a few months of this fiscal year. Since the banking community can no longer supply large amounts of capital to arms manufacturers and related industries that urgently need capital for development, and on the other hand, there is no investing public in Japan—the Bank of Japan, under the dangerous circumstances of massive currency inflation, must purchase public bonds and store them in its vaults as a reserve for new public bonds, and ultimately increase the issuance of banknotes.</p>
<p>Again, we talk about the national control of the Japanese economy. In a country like Japan, where control is already very strong in peacetime, one cannot expect significant effects. This is another reason for disappointment and anxiety for the navy and army. There are two reasons why those in Japan who are engaged in war cannot fully control the wartime economic mechanism. The first reason is that they are busy with war matters and have no knowledge of industrial, financial, or trade matters. In addition, well-organized large companies and many industrial and commercial groups are unwilling to hand over their industries to state management. The disintegration of Japan's economic organization or domestic division is extremely dangerous at present. For this reason, the wartime economic regulations in the special session of the Diet in early September were of a conciliatory nature and slightly restricted the freedom of some capitalist enterprises.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the Japanese government obtained certain powers of free disposal from the Diet, but only to maintain the yen exchange rate and strictly supply funds for the development of the arms industry. As for the overall economic policy, at least for the time being, it can only be done on the principle of voluntary cooperation between powerful figures in the economic world and the government. Speaking of the war against China, the navy and army at least have the feeling that they can now rely on those commercial leaders who have been opposing the military. Because although they opposed the war at the beginning, now their losses in China are very large, and the danger of their future investments and markets is very acute, so they have to go on and share the fate of those who advocate war.

<h3>Chickens and Ducks Available in Various Vegetable Markets Yesterday</h3>
<p>Most of the chickens, ducks, and game in this city come from Jiangbei and inland areas. Since the traffic in Shanghai has been obstructed, the sources are very few, and the demand from chicken vendors is very high every day, resulting in very few of these goods in the small vegetable markets and the prices are surprisingly high. Now the chicken and duck merchants are rushing to Tongzhou, Jiangbei, and other places by foreign ships to purchase. Recently, after the opening of the Gaoqiao line in Pudong, many chicken vendors have gone to Pudong to purchase, so yesterday there were chickens and ducks available in various small vegetable markets, and the market price was one yuan per catty. As for the game, it has long disappeared.</p>

<h3>Damage to Yarn Factories in War Zone to Be Investigated Later</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, having previously received an order from the Ministry of Industry to investigate the damage to various factories, immediately forwarded it to the relevant industries for compliance. Now, the association reported yesterday based on a report from the Yarn Factory Federation, and telegraphed to the Ministry of Industry, stating: "Ministry of Industry, Recently, we received a letter from the Chinese Yarn Factory Federation stating that we received a telegram from the Ministry of Industry, opening with an investigation of the damage to factories in Shanghai. According to the points opened in the telegram, a report should be prepared and submitted for summary and transfer. We also received a report form, and have distributed it to our members' factories in the war zone in this city for verification and completion. Recently, according to reports from various factories, many said that they are located in the war zone, and since the outbreak of the war, employees have been scattered and out of contact, and the damage situation cannot be investigated. It is necessary to wait for the opening of the war zone, conduct a thorough investigation, and then fill out the form. It is true that the factories in the war zone are isolated and cannot be investigated. We should wait for the opening, and then conduct a thorough investigation and report for accuracy. We hereby inform you, and we ask you to report to the Ministry of Industry for the record. After checking the requests of the association, it is for the sake of seeking verification, so we are telegraphed to your ministry for verification and approval to postpone the reporting temporarily. When the war zone is opened, we will conduct a thorough investigation and transfer for public convenience. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<h3>Giant Ships Circumnavigating the World Are Not Coming to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Due to Unresolved Warfare, Perceived as Unsafe</p>
<p>The North German Lloyd's largest mail ship, the "Bremen," with a carrying capacity of 52,000 tons and a displacement of 67,000 tons, is the largest ship rebuilt after the German war and one of the world's six largest ships. This year, the ship specially launched a world tour, carrying over a thousand tourists from New York and Bremen on a world tour. The initial route was from the Atlantic Ocean through the Mediterranean Sea to Hong Kong, then to Shanghai, then to Japan, and across the Pacific Ocean to the United States. However, the local office has received a telegram from Germany stating that the ship originally intended to go to Singapore and then to Shanghai. However, due to the unresolved Sino-Japanese war and the continued danger in Shanghai, the scheduled arrival at the end of January has been changed, and the ship will not come to Shanghai, but will instead go to Australia and New Zealand. In addition, the Cunard Line's "Franconia" and the China Navigation Company's "Empress of Britain" world tour ships have also sent telegrams to Shanghai, stating that Shanghai is still within the war zone and the route has been changed. The world tour groups carried will no longer come to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>"Great Way Government" Issues Proclamations and Notices</h3>
<p>The Situation in Pudong Remains Very Precarious</p>
<p>Since the emergence of the so-called "Great Way Government" in Pudong, the area around Rotten Mud Ferry has been relatively calm on the surface. However, the towns west of Yangjing are under strict inspection, and Dongchang Road and Lujiazui Road have even been renamed. The "Great Way Government" has also issued two proclamations and one notice in the name of a Mr. Su. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Strict Inspection</p>
<p>The Great Way Municipal Government and various police stations have now been established in Rotten Mud Ferry, Pudong. On the surface, the Pudong area appears to be prosperous. However, the towns west of Yangjing are under strict inspection. As a result, a group of hooligans from the Hubei and Qingkou gangs are falsely claiming to be plainclothes detectives and extorting money from merchants. However, the Japanese army is very resentful of extortion and theft and is trying to eliminate them. A few days ago, a Jiangbei man named Wang Er was sentenced to death for fraud. In the past two days, women residing in Zhoupu, Sanlintang, and the towns west of Yangjing in Pudong have been overwhelmed with fear and have taken detours to Gaoqiao to take boats to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Recent Situation in Zhoupu</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gong Xiaodi and others, the leaders of the Zhoupu Town Maintenance Association, were unable to quell their resentment when Wang Pixian, a key figure in the "Tongmenghui," attempted to seize the rights of the Maintenance Association. They killed several members of Wang's group. Gong went into hiding after the incident. Afterwards, over a hundred Japanese soldiers arrived in the town and investigated the matter. After confirming that the deceased were all Chinese, they took no further action. It is reported that the Japanese army has set up thirteen posts in the town and a curfew after 5:30 PM, with so-called patrol teams patrolling. The chairman of the Maintenance Association is still Zhang Xuezhou, assisted by a Mr. Hu and a Mr. Chi.</p>
<p>Renaming of Roads</p>
<p>After the establishment of the so-called Great Way Government in the Pudong area, officials were dispatched yesterday to change the names of roads and alleys. Wooden signs with road names written in ink were made in advance and nailed to utility poles at the entrances of various roads and alleys. The character "road" (路) was changed to "thoroughfare" (通). Currently, Dongchang Road, the busiest road, has been renamed Fukushima Thoroughfare, and Lujiazui Road has been renamed Sato Thoroughfare.</p>
<p>Proclamations and Notices</p>
<p>The Great Way Government established in Pudong issued two proclamations and one notice yesterday in the name of Mayor Su Xiwen. One stated that the government was established on November 3rd to maintain local order and protect the peace and security of the people. The mayor officially used his seal and took office on that day. In addition to sending letters and proclamations, it is hoped that all people will be informed. The second stated that since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, it has been four months (omission). The city's order urgently needs to be restored, and finance, transportation, and police affairs are extremely important. Without first organizing them, it will not be possible to restore the original state. For the sake of maintaining local order, this office has temporarily established the Finance, Transportation, Police, and Social Affairs Bureaus in Pudong to gradually advance municipal affairs. All former municipal government and bureau staff who wish to return to work must submit a letter with supporting documents to 637 Dixwell Road within seven days. Another notice stated that the city's administration has been suspended for a long time. The mayor was compelled to take on the difficult task due to the recommendations of various Daoists and the urging of local communities. Therefore, on November 3rd, he formally announced his inauguration and used his seal in Pudong, and had issued a telegram proclamation. However, as the mayor is just beginning his term, he hopes that the elders and communities at sea will provide guidance.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson Ships Change Course to Chongming</h3>
<p>Yesterday Carried Over a Thousand People to Shanghai, Along with Vegetables and Mutton</p>
<p>The "Minna," a medium-sized ship of Jardine Matheson, a British company, has changed its route to Chongming after withdrawing from the Shanghai-Gaoqiao route. Yesterday at 4:00 PM, it arrived in Shanghai for the first time from Chongming, docking at the new customs wharf. It carried 1,500 passengers and a large amount of cargo, including a large quantity of Chinese cabbage and hundreds of slaughtered sheep, which were brought to the market.</p>
<h3>Various Roads North of Suzhou Creek Gradually Return to Normal</h3>
<p>Most Residents Have Moved Back, and Some Shops Have Reopened</p>
<p>According to a survey by a Datong News Agency reporter yesterday morning, most of the shops north of Suzhou Creek and west of Jiangxi Road have resumed business. Most of the residents have also moved back. As a result, small vegetable markets such as Tangjia Alley and Tiewei Road have become bustling again. The sandbags that were previously piled up behind the Wensi Road (intersection of North Jiangxi Road) vegetable market, preventing pedestrians from traveling east, have now been opened with a gap, allowing passage from Wensi Road to North Jiangxi Road. The terminus of the Route 14 trolleybus on North Henan Road has been extended to Avenue Road. Since the opening of North Xizang Road, some shops on the east side, such as sauce shops and cigarette shops, have also reopened. However, the Chinese area on the west side has become a field of rubble, with no intact houses and few people to be seen.</p>
<h3>News of Transferring All Refugees from the French Concession to the South City</h3>
<p>Negotiations with the International Committee, May Be Achieved in the Short Term</p>
<p>It is heard that there are currently about fifty refugee shelters in the French Concession. The French authorities, believing that the order in the refugee areas has gradually stabilized, plan to move all the refugees within the concession to the refugee areas in the city. The planned method is to relocate them to public places within the City God Temple. If there are empty houses in the refugee areas or houses that are large and have few people, they will be used as resettlement locations. This plan is currently being negotiated with the International Committee and will be implemented in the short term.</p>
<h3>Catholic Association Sends Letters to Various Churches Soliciting Clothing and Toys</h3>
<p>Will Distribute Christmas Gifts to Disaster-Stricken Children</p>
<p>The annual Christmas holiday is approaching soon. The Chinese Catholic Association plans to distribute Christmas gifts to disaster-stricken children and has sent letters to various Christian churches in Shanghai, soliciting clothing, food, toys, etc. The general idea of the original letter is as follows: Since the outbreak of the August 13th incident, refugees have been sleeping on the streets and exposed to the elements. The children of refugees are either suffering from hunger and cold or are plagued by diseases. In the meantime, they have been displaced and even died. According to various reports, there are currently about 300,000 refugees in the city, and children account for more than one-third, about 120,000. Alas, the suffering of these disaster victims is extreme, and how can we support these children? Our association has always regarded children as the lifeline of the country, and we should first provide them with relief in the event of extraordinary changes. Therefore, we have established children's shelters in the war zone, which have housed more than 180 refugee children. In order to meet the current needs, we have expanded the shelter and moved it to the St. John's YMCA in the French Vatican Concession, which is expected to accommodate about 600 refugee children. In addition, our association has also established a temporary children's clinic in the Nanshi refugee area to treat children's diseases. The above points are all that our association should do and are in line with Christ's teachings on cherishing children. This year's Christmas is coming soon. Our fellow believers will surely give generously during this festival to show the Lord's grace and expand relief efforts. Therefore, on behalf of 120,000 refugee children, we dare to make a plea for all kinds of clothing, food, toys, and money. We hope to donate as much as possible to spread the grace of all fellow believers to the refugee children. The Lord said to his disciples, "If you do these things to one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you do it to me." The teachings are clear, the Catholic alarm bell, and the sage's famous saying "cherish the young and cherish the young" all come from love and sincerity. Our fellow believers will surely think carefully and reflect on it. We hope that you will generously give to the disaster-stricken children. In addition, Lu Shixi, director of the Xuhui Shelter at the Xujiahui Catholic Church, in view of the approaching Christmas and the suffering of countless disaster-stricken children, launched a disaster-stricken children's relief campaign to provide some comfort during this festival. He also sent letters to Wing On, Sincere, Gansheng Yuan, Taikang, Kangyuan, and other major companies, soliciting toys to be distributed to the disaster-stricken children in the shelter and its branches on Christmas Day (25th) to provide consolation. He also welcomes children from all families to bring candy and old toys to the shelter on that day to distribute to the disaster-stricken children.</p>
<h3>What is the Nationality of the Grenade Thrower on Nanjing Road?</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that the person who threw a hand grenade at the marching Japanese soldiers on Nanjing Road last Friday was shot on the spot and died of his injuries. Yesterday was the date for the autopsy, but the suspicious party refused to examine the body and did not recognize the person identified by the Japanese side. The Chinese court prosecutor refused to examine the body because the person's nationality was unknown and did not recognize the Japanese claim that he was Chinese. It is suspected that he was Korean.</p>
<h3>German Residents Generously Donate to Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>A Total of Over 25,000 Yuan, Allocated to Various Groups and Hospitals</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, refugees have been displaced and suffering unspeakable hardships. The German merchants in Shanghai, witnessing this, generously opened their wallets and actively donated. It is estimated that the German donations transferred through the German Consulate General in Shanghai totaled over 25,500 yuan. It is learned that the competent authorities have sent a letter of thanks to the German Consulate General and have detailed the distribution of the relief donations. The Shanghai International Refugee Relief Association received 6,279 German marks, the Guangdong Shanghai Refugee Relief Committee received 10,000 yuan, the Nutrition Department of the Civilian Children's Hospital received 6,000 yuan, and the Shilong Hospital received 2,000 yuan to help the injured. The above totaled 25,279 German marks.</p>
<h3>Greatly Different Accounts of the Japanese Flag Insult Incident</h3>
<p>The China Press reports that the British Consulate authorities are studying the case of British lawyer Mr. Metcalfe insulting the Japanese flag after receiving a note from the Japanese authorities. According to reliable sources, the Japanese authorities have not yet made a formal apology to the British Consul General. Mr. Metcalfe is still free as the case is in progress, but it is extremely doubtful what action can be taken. The British authorities find it difficult to start an investigation. It is said that on that day, a Japanese man forcibly placed a Japanese flag in Metcalfe's hand, and Metcalfe broke the flagpole and threw it on the road, angering the Japanese and leading to an assault. He was then escorted to safety by the Shanghai Municipal Police. The account given by the authorities today is very different, saying that a British man borrowed two Japanese flags from a Japanese man and then tore them up for no reason, angering the Japanese, who decided to hold a meeting and ask the British authorities to take appropriate action against the person to satisfy the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Hoping That All Sectors Will Employ Refugees</h3>
<p>Permanent Relief and Social Stability</p>
<p>The vocational guidance department of the First Refugee Shelter in the Great World of Shanghai has been helping refugees find various jobs and solve their personal livelihoods. In the past half month, it has received letters from various factories and businesses, or discussed employment face-to-face, almost every day. After the trial employment, both parties were very satisfied and the results were good. However, due to the large scale of the shelter and the large number of refugees, it is difficult to introduce all of them at once. Therefore, as of now, there are still hundreds of refugees who have received strict training and have more knowledge but are waiting to find jobs. The largest number are textile workers, followed by velvet workers and cigarette workers, and then kitchen workers, tailors, odd job workers, shoe workers, and plasterers. It is hoped that the patriotic factories and businesses will employ the above workers as much as possible. The shelter is very willing to carefully select and introduce them. Employing refugees is the most effective way to provide relief to refugees and a long-term solution to stabilize society.</p>
<p>The 101st Shelter at 350 Guangdong Road in Shanghai currently has over 800 male and female refugees. The supplies are very scarce. Chen Pengju, the director of the shelter, specially set up an introduction department to design production and reduce the burden on the shelter, undertaking embroidery, sewing, knitting, and labor services at particularly low prices. If various sectors need the above work, they can contact Director Chen of the shelter.</p>
<h3>United Association of the First Special District Solicits Donations to Relief Refugees</h3>
<p>Both Items and Cash Donations Are Welcome</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' United Association's Refugee Relief Committee issued a letter to all sectors soliciting donations for relief refugees: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, hundreds of millions of people have suffered enormous losses. Those who have lost their homes, accommodated by the various shelters and sent back to their hometowns, have reached hundreds of thousands. Due to the large number of refugees, fundraising is difficult, and the cries of hunger and cold are self-evident. Moreover, with the expansion of the war zone, refugees from neighboring towns near the city have also gathered in Shanghai. The shelters are already experiencing a lack of food and clothing and are overcrowded. As a result, refugees who cannot eat enough during the day and sleep on the streets at night are everywhere. The tragic situation of displacement is difficult to describe. As the cold winter approaches, how will hundreds of thousands of refugees survive? The association is saddened by this and has organized a refugee relief committee to appeal for help. For the sake of universality, it advocates continuing the one-cent donation. If we save one cent a day, we can relieve the refugees. "Many a little makes a mickle" is a clear motto from ancient times, and it is very easy to implement. It is hoped that all celebrities, virtuous people from all walks of life, or monks and nuns, or ladies from the boudoir will actively support and jointly carry out this good deed. If you are willing to donate generously, a drop in the bucket or a penny is not too small, and a thousand granaries or ten thousand yi is not too much. Saving those in danger and helping those in despair is a immeasurable act of merit. Donations will be published in the newspaper to promote benevolence. Crying and expressing words, I hope for public consideration. Attached are the measures for soliciting donations of relief supplies for refugees: ㊀ The association's solicitation of goods and donations for refugee relief shall be in accordance with the provisions of these measures. ㊁ The association's solicitation of items shall be based on the needs of refugees, and shall be temporarily divided into the following categories: A. Food category, such as rice, flour, sesame cakes, steamed buns, bread, mantou, Chinese cabbage, pickled mustard, pickles, and other foods. B. Fuel category, such as coal, charcoal, firewood, etc. C. Medicine category, medicines suitable for treating various diseases. D. Bedding category, such as cotton quilts, cotton clothes, cotton pants, etc. E. Daily necessities category, daily necessities needed by refugees. ㊂ The association's solicitation of donations shall be temporarily divided into daily one-cent donations and special donations. A. Daily one-cent donation, 1. Anyone with considerable income shall save 1 cent of legal tender per day. 2. Those with occupations but very little income can jointly donate 1 cent of legal tender per day. 3. Housewives and children can also save 1 cent of legal tender per day. 4. Personnel from agencies, public groups, companies, factories, and stores, in addition to doing their best and donating one cent per person per day, can save one cent per table from meal expenses. 5. The above daily one-cent donation shall be at least 10 days as a unit for individuals, and agencies, public groups, companies, factories, and stores shall remit once a week. B. Special donations. 1. All donations other than the one-cent donation are special donations. ㊂ The above donations shall be collected by the bank designated by the association or the association's office. ㊄ These measures shall be implemented after being approved by the association's full committee meeting.</p>
<h3>The International Relief Society Established the Sixth Shelter Yesterday</h3>
<p>Specializing in Sheltering Stray Refugees on the Streets and Alleys, Employees of Zhentai Company Generously Sponsor, Red Cross Concert Held Tonight</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Society, in order to relieve stray refugees along the streets and alleys, has added the sixth shelter in the Money Shop Guild Hall. After days of preparation, it was officially announced yesterday. It is planned to first shelter 2,000 stray refugees. All supplies, in addition to being raised by the association, have also been strongly supported by the employees of Zhentai Textile Company. The association received a letter from the employees of Zhentai Company yesterday, stating that since the launch of the one-cent movement to relieve refugees, considerable results have been achieved. After contacting your association in advance to form the sixth shelter, the funds raised by our office will be used for the relief of the sixth shelter. We hereby respectfully offer the first month's donation of 4,574.15 yuan in legal tender (including 227.15 yuan from the Machine Joint Double Ten Dinner Party) and another 882 yuan, totaling 5,456.15 yuan. Please issue a receipt separately. Subsequent solicitations will continue to be resolved.</p>
<p>Lack of Bowls and Chopsticks in the Refugee Area</p>
<p>Since the Nanshi refugee area has changed to providing meals and restored the use of Tiger Stoves, the refugees' diet has improved. It is learned that the stock of rice in the area is small. The International Relief Society has decided to continue sending 1,600 bags today. However, the number of refugees moving into the area from the concessions has been increasing day by day. Therefore, it is still hoped that enthusiastic benefactors will continue to donate refugee food to maintain it. At the same time, there is also a shortage of utensils such as bowls, chopsticks, and rice cookers, which need to be donated by all sectors.</p>
<p>Red Cross Week Music Gala</p>
<p>The Red Cross fundraising week promoted by the Chinese Red Cross Society and the Shanghai International Committee has been organized by female students from Chinese and foreign schools to form street fundraising teams and conduct fundraising in districts for days, and the results are very impressive. The Chinese and Western music gala prepared by the association will be held at the Great Shanghai Theater tonight. All the programs are performed by famous Chinese and Western opera singers, and the content is extremely exciting. Ticket prices range from one yuan to three yuan, and all proceeds will be used to relieve refugees.</p>
<p>Ningbo Association Donates White Rice</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, in view of the insufficient supply of rice in Shanghai recently, many residents have changed to eating wheat food. However, the eating habits of the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are not well understood, and it is difficult to swallow after a long time. At this time, refugees in the refugee area must rely solely on wheat-made foods to fill their hunger. Over time, there will be a nutritional impact. Without occasional rice seasoning, health is difficult to allow. Therefore, 200 shi of Yong rice were specially purchased from Ningbo. They have arrived in Shanghai by ship yesterday. All are the best white rice, valued at 2,234.10 yuan. The association has agreed to donate them all to the Nanshi refugee area and has dispatched Chen Zhengzhang to personally escort the rice into the refugee area this morning and deliver it to Father Rao for distribution to the refugees to supplement their nutrition.</p>

<h3>The Fifth Batch of Foreign Rice Loaded onto the Chengdu Wheel and Shipped</h3>
<p>Still Sorted by Five Hundred Rice Shops, Miscellaneous Grain Industry Agrees Rice Will Arrive This Month, 60,000 Bags of Zhejiang Rice Waiting for Ship to Depart</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grain, Bean, and Rice Trades Association, together with a rice shop, arrived in Shanghai from Tongzhou and purchased domestic food. After being approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, they are about to load wheels and transport them to Shanghai. The second batch of foreign rice from Yongda Bank is loaded onto the Margaret Johnson Wheel and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th. The French firm Da Fu Foreign Bank has continued to order 50,000 bags of foreign rice. The Rice Shop Trades Association is handling five batches of rice distribution. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Da Fu Foreign Bank Continues to Order Foreign Rice</p>
<p>The French firm Da Fu Foreign Bank, entrusted by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the China Rice Industry Company, ordered 115,000 bags of foreign rice, which have been shipped in four batches and arrived in Shanghai one after another. They have been received by the Rice Shop Trades Association for retail distribution. The 5,000 bags of rice ordered by various factories and individuals have been loaded onto the French mail ship Lilo and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th. In order to regulate the food of Shanghai citizens, it has independently ordered 50,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, which have been loaded onto the British firm Taikoo Wheel Company's Chengdu and other two wheels and shipped. The first ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 12th of this month, and has been agreed with Zhang Nianxuan, chairman of the Rice Shop Trades Association, to be received by the association for retail distribution.</p>
<p>The Association Handles Five Batches of Rice Distribution</p>
<p>The Rice Shop Trades Association issued a notice yesterday stating that the rice jointly operated by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the China Rice Industry Company will continue to arrive in port. This batch of grain has been agreed to be distributed by the association to 500 rice shops within the Public Concession and the French Concession. It is hoped that each rice shop will bring the card issued by the association and prepay the car fare of ten yuan to the meeting office to fill in the application form on the 7th and 8th of this month (time from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm). The deadline will be cut off after the deadline, do not delay. All 500 extra temporarily registered member rice shops have been repeatedly consulted by the association on the release of the quota, but the result has not been agreed, and only the original quota is limited to the special notice.</p>
<p>Grain Industry Purchases Grain in Batches and Ships</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grain Trades Association member Yongda Bank has ordered a total of 80,000 bags of foreign rice from abroad, which will be shipped to Shanghai in four batches. The first batch of 20,000 bags has been shipped to Shanghai by the Shunzhi Wheel. The second batch of 26,000 bags has been loaded onto the Margaret Johnson Wheel and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th of this month. It has been sold by the bank at a fair price to various factories and refugee relief agencies, and has been completely sold out in advance. The third and fourth batches, totaling 34,000 bags, have been loaded onto wheels in two batches and are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai completely before the 25th of this month.</p>
<p>Purchase of Grain Has Been Approved</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grain, Bean, and Rice Trades Association member rice shops purchased domestic food from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which has been approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government. The rice from the three places of Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang has been purchased 60,000 bags and is waiting for wheel loading and transportation. With the assistance of the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, the safety of navigation is guaranteed. As for the grain purchased from Taixian and Dongtai, with the permission of the Jiangsu Provincial Food Management Committee, the first batch of more than 200 bags of yellow beans and red beans has been loaded onto the Shanghai-Tong Wheel and the Taikoo Company's Wuxue Wheel and arrived in Shanghai from Tongzhou.</p>
<p>China Company Regulates People's Food</p>
<p>The China Rice Industry Company previously cooperated with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession to regulate the food of Shanghai citizens and entrusted the French firm Da Fu Foreign Bank to order 115,000 bags of foreign rice, which have been completely shipped to Shanghai. It has now decided to continue ordering according to the needs of the market, but it has not been entrusted to continue ordering until yesterday. In addition, it was learned from Da Fu Foreign Bank that the foreign rice loaded on the Chengdu Wheel is 2,500 tons (about 25,000 bags), which is independently ordered by the foreign bank and is distributed by the rice shop for retail sale.</p>
<p>Reasons for Crowding at Rice Shops</p>
<p>The 500 rice shops in the Public Concession and the French Concession have completely resumed business retail after receiving 40 bags of rice each in the fourth batch of distribution on the 6th, but the crowding situation in the stores has not been reduced. It is learned that the reasons are: ㊀ The number of poor citizens in the concession has increased. ㊁ The middle class is deeply afraid of the interruption of rice, so they send people to buy it everywhere when the rice store opens. ㊂ There are still speculators, each with a capital of several yuan, who sell rice to each rice store and then sell the whole number of five dou or one dan to some small restaurants or residents, from which they take a small profit. The restaurants and residents can't afford to squeeze, and they are willing to buy, so the rice received by the rice shop each time cannot meet the corresponding demand, and the crux of the problem lies here.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Health Department Continues to Solicit Blood</h3>
<p>Manufacturing Serum, Injecting Refugee Children</p>
<p>The Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council is concerned that children in various refugee shelters are at risk of contracting measles (also known as measles), so it has solicited blood from the public to manufacture serum for injection. Various newspapers and radio stations have kindly agreed to assist and advertise on their behalf, and their kindness is deeply appreciated. Recently, the number of applicants has gradually increased, but the blood supply is still insufficient for application. Therefore, the Municipal Council must continue to solicit for two weeks. Any enthusiastic person who is willing to donate blood can contact the Municipal Council Office 102 or the Patrol Hospital at 445 Shanhai Pass Road from Monday to Friday, 9:00 am to 12:00 pm, 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm, and Saturday, 9:00 am to 12:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Tenant Sues Landlord for Damaging Water and Electricity, Obstructing Residence</h3>
<p>After Earnest Mediation by the Judge, Both Parties Ordered to Reach a Settlement</p>
<p>Dong Jifu, 57, a native of Wu County and the general manager of the Yifeng Enamel Factory at 324 Avenue Edward VII, and Pan Xieyang, 28, a native of Nanhui and an employee of the same factory, were recently sued by Liu Zishan, Fu Shaochuan, Ye Yangshi, Zhu Chunsheng, Chen Huijuan, and other tenants from ten households residing at No. 47 Fuzhi Lane, Belle Road in the French Concession. They jointly filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, accusing the defendants of damaging water and electricity, obstructing freedom of residence, and requesting a summons for investigation and prosecution. According to the complaint, the plaintiffs rented the three-story property of the Youheng Real Estate Company, owned by the first defendant, for their residence. A contract was signed at that time. However, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, landlords of houses in the concession have been reaping great profits, and the first defendant intended to breach the contract in order to take back the house for re-rental, hoping to obtain a higher rent. They did not hesitate to use the excuse of demolishing the house, ordering the tenants to move out, and resorted to oppressive measures such as cutting off the water and electricity supply. Furthermore, the second defendant led seven or eight thugs to break into the plaintiffs' homes, surrounding them and preventing them from moving, among other egregious actions. After reporting to the French police, those individuals dispersed, and the siege was lifted. The defendants were taking advantage of the wartime situation to raise rents and use various methods to drive out the tenants. It was found that the plaintiffs have resided there for over ten years. The defendants, by virtue of their position as landlords, were oppressing the tenants, which is inhumane. The plaintiffs requested a strict investigation according to the law. After receiving the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Liao, held a hearing yesterday afternoon to summon the defendants. The plaintiffs, accompanied by their lawyer Tao Ran, appeared in court and recounted the defendants' actions of eviction and oppression. When questioned, the defendants Dong Jifu and Pan Xieyang confessed that they took such measures because the plaintiffs had been in arrears with their rent. They claimed that they had already restored the water and electricity supply and denied leading any thugs to commit violence. The judge examined their testimonies and told the two defendants that in these times of national crisis, they should show empathy and understanding towards the tenants' plight. How could they resort to such inhuman and outrageous acts? He severely reprimanded them and ordered both defendants to post bail and negotiate a settlement. The case was adjourned to the afternoon of the 13th for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Six Thieves Arrested by Xinzha Police</h3>
<p>Detained Pending Investigation, Hearing Adjourned</p>
<p>Liu Ronggen and Ding Huaguo, Chinese detectives of the Xinzha Police Station, learned that a gang of thieves was hiding at No. 63 Kang Nao Road, plotting illegal activities. They, together with Western Detective Chief Bao Taimi, went to the address at 6:20 PM the day before yesterday and arrested the thieves Shen Xiaosanzi, Yu Xiantang, Pu Longhai, Yu Asi, and others. They confiscated two fake pistols, one fake jade bracelet, rings, porcelain bottles, and other items, and brought them all to the police station. In addition, Chinese Detective No. 70 of the Xinzha Police Station arrested the thieves Wu Lincai and Zhou Fukun at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Jing'an Temple Road the day before yesterday and brought them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyers Wang Yaotang and Qian Xunjiu presented the case and requested approval for detention to facilitate the investigation. After Judge Dai briefly questioned each defendant, he ordered them to be detained pending a further hearing.</p>
<h3>The Boy Who Was Stabbed Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Court Conducts Post-Mortem Examination Yesterday</p>
<p>Shan Sude, a local boy from Zhujiazhai, Longhua, was eighteen years old this year. When our army retreated from the southwestern part of Shanghai, he and his family sought refuge in the Xujiahui area of the western district of the concession. At around 6:00 PM on the sixth, he went out to shop and mistakenly entered the Chinese territory of Tushanwan, where he was stabbed with a bayonet in his right cheek, right thigh, left leg, and other places. He collapsed in a pool of blood. After being discovered by a patrolman of the French police, he was reported to the police station and taken to the Red Cross General Hospital on Haige Road by police car. He died at 4:00 AM the next morning due to his severe injuries. The police station transported the body to the morgue. As there were no relatives to claim the body, the Second Special Court was notified yesterday, and Prosecutor Wang conducted an examination. The body was taken by the Tongren Fuyuantang for burial.</p>
<h3>International Committee Members of the Red Cross Visit Refugee Camps</h3>
<p>Both Jiao Tong University and the YMCA Camps Have Excellent Facilities and Education</p>
<p>On the 6th of this month, Liu Zhanen, Zhu Shaoping, Chen Heqin, and Ms. Lu Aide, members of the International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross, visited several refugee camps run by the Salvation Army and the YMCA. The situation is as follows: ㊀ Jiao Tong University Refugee Camp, run by the Salvation Army, houses 17,000 refugees, including 1,200 children. A school for refugee children has been established, and a embroidery class has been set up for women, providing considerable education. Today, an opening ceremony was held, with the above-mentioned committee members giving speeches respectively. Ms. Lu Aide also taught a cleanliness song, which the students found very interesting. The camp has high and spacious buildings, excellent facilities, and a hospital and midwifery room, with both Chinese and Western doctors and nurses. ㊁ YMCA Refugee Camp, located on Luzon Road in the French Concession, also has good facilities, including a clinic and a convalescent room. There is already a school for school-age children, and a needlework class has been set up for women. Unfortunately, the place is too small, and refugees lack opportunities for activities. In addition, the school supplies for the refugee children's schools in each camp are provided by the Education Section of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Adult education is currently being actively prepared.</p>
<h3>Establishment of a So-Called Police Station in Caojiadu</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai West Caojiadu Police Sub-Bureau was ordered to close and disband on November 30th, it has been many days. The policing authority in that area was initially taken over by the Jing'an Temple Police Station of the Public Concession. However, on the 3rd of this month, a team of Japanese military police suddenly took over the Caojiadu Sub-Bureau and its various police stations. The Jing'an Temple Police Station then withdrew the patrolmen stationed on the roads built beyond the boundary. A portion of the Japanese military police also withdrew the day before yesterday. Yesterday, a Chen, a Wu, and a Yang initiated the organization of a so-called Caojiadu Police Headquarters, which was declared established on the same day.</p>

<h3>Last Guidance Meeting of the Electricity Company Service Department</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company will hold its last guidance tea party today (December 8th) from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM in the kitchen on the sixth floor of the company at No. 181 Nanjing Road. The meeting will be chaired by Mrs. Taylor, Director of the Home Service Department, to discuss various new and delicious recipes and demonstrate how economical and perfect cooking can be with an electric stove. It is said that the oven on the electric stove is equipped with an electric heat controller, which makes the baking of cakes and the smoking of meats even and crispy. The quick-heating iron plate cooks vegetables, preserving their original color and retaining their fresh taste, which is far superior to other cooking methods. All wise housewives who want to gain new knowledge about special delicacies and are interested in everyday cooking problems are welcome to participate.</p>
<h3>The Money Trade Reserve Held an Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Liu Wuqiao Elected Chairman of the Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade United Reserve held a temporary executive committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Liu Wuqiao reported that the chairman of the committee, Shao Yanshan, had passed away, and in accordance with the law, one chairman of the committee and one standing committee member should be elected to fill the vacancies. The election began immediately, and Liu Wuqiao was elected as chairman of the committee, and Lu Shuchen was elected as a standing committee member. The meeting adjourned at around 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of the Case of Embezzlement of Rice and Grain by the Director of the Refugee Camp</h3>
<p>Hearing Still Adjourned Pending Summons of Witnesses</p>
<p>Fan Tianjin, the director, Kong Xianyu, the deputy director, and Wang Jianqing, the assistant, of the 15th Refugee Camp at No. 680 Haige Road, which is affiliated to the Shanghai Charity Organization United Disaster Relief Association, were found to have inflated the number of refugees and embezzled food rations. Xie Guanghan, an investigator from the Disaster Relief Association, discovered this and reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Chinese Detective Chief Tang Zihong arrested Kong and Wang, while Fan fled. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin opened the court for interrogation. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that during the adjournment, it was found that the defendants had embezzled ten shi of rice and thirty-five bags of flour, worth a total of 305 yuan. Because the defendants did not have time to prepare, the detectives obtained a lot of evidence and are now prosecuting them under Article 336 of the Criminal Law for embezzling publicly held goods for public benefit, requesting strict punishment according to the law. Then, Detective Tang reported the investigation process to the court. When questioned, Kong and Wang vehemently denied the accusations. Judge Fu then adjourned the hearing to summon witnesses for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Promotion of the "One Cent Donation" Movement</h3>
<p>The International Relief Association advocates for a daily one-cent donation, and all sectors are enthusiastically donating. The association received an additional 57 yuan for the first month from the employees of Wanyuanxiang yesterday, 15 yuan from the staff of the Victoria Nurses' Home, 79.5 yuan from the members of the Public Bus Drivers' Mutual Aid Association, 10 yuan from the Silver and Money Industry Amateur Friendship Association, 28.5 yuan from the staff of the Taikoo Wuxue Lun, 300 yuan from the owner of Moran, 30 yuan from Wan Shanji, 21 yuan from Yao Songru, 9 yuan from Xu Tiecheng, 9 yuan from Xu Feirenchu, 24 yuan from Sun Yi and others, 100 yuan from the staff of Tongrunzhuang, 10 yuan each from the Little Brother Ding Zongming's brothers Zongyan, Zongliu, and Zonghao, and sisters Manfang, Qiongfang, Zhifang, Tongfang, Xiaofang, and Yunfang, 16 yuan in food savings from the employees of the Shanghai Kailin Company Sales Office Wharf Management Office, 19.2 yuan from the staff of Xinyongshunhao, 10 yuan from the employees of the Public Works Department 339, 68 yuan from No. 8 Hengye Lane, Jiangxi Road, 6 yuan from Jiang Yuchen, and many others donated 3 yuan or 4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Prisoners in the West Prison Will Be Transported as Usual</h3>
<p>Due to its proximity to the war zone, the Huade Road West Prison, managed by the Municipal Council, has faced difficulties in transporting prisoners in and out. Therefore, every Tuesday was designated as the day for transferring prisoners in and out. Prisoners sentenced by the court were temporarily held at the police station and then transferred in on Tuesdays. Now that the area has gradually stabilized, this measure may be changed and returned to normal.</p>

Ms. Xu has served in the medical field for nearly twenty years in the north and south of the Yangtze River and has conducted in-depth research in obstetrics.
