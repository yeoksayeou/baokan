<h3>賡績援綏運動都</h3>
<p>自綏邊發此戰事以來全國所給予經濟之援助。一時頗具風發泉湧之勢。而對於負傷戰士之慰勞。災區人民之救濟。又無日不在後方人士關念策劃之中。日前財部專員。會同滬慈善團體聯合會常委。隨載賑品。遄赴綏垣。慰問傷兵。而致犒勞。匪僅病黎沾實際之惠。且令三軍興挾纊之感。跋涉意義。非同尋常。惟以粥少僧多。終覺不敷分配。此外頗聞邊地哀鴻。備嘗瑣尾之痛。際茲天寒地凍。更覺待賑孔亟。本埠慈團聯會已據該會兩常委來電之陳述。分函各界作廣大之勸募。吾人亦甚欲於此盡其宣揚之責任。藉達呼籲之隱情。痌𤹣在抱敢求傾聽。</p>
<p>綏戰發動之始舉國輸貲之動機。端以軍實為目標。蓋悍匪當前。幕後有人。糈械供億。予取予求。而我以邊瘠省分。勉任艱巨。自非繕修軍備。難期應付裕如。其後幸得收復要隘。挫沮敵氛。固由羣衆鼓舞。使將士有必死之志。亦以接濟浩穰。俾給養免匱乏之憂。迄於今日。前綫戰事。雖暫停頓。而野心策動。仍在醞釀。關於軍事之配備。依然未見有可弛之道。而戰後遺骼之掩埋。負傷士卒之療養。殉國烈士之撫䘏。失所難民之安頓。胥有賴於資源之調劑。吾人遙想呻吟一榻之壯士。殘損肢體之慘狀。為誰辛苦。而貽此恨。中心惻怚之餘。固難釋而弗問。卽在兵燹孑遺之輩。蕩析流離之家。亦何莫非吾人之同氣。而寗能效秦越之漠視。然而一方需欵殷急之情。正當焦點。一方支援𧒒壯之氣。已就消沉。如此。則前途艱險。何待煩言。吾人所以必須作堅强不斷之努力。為賡續援綏之運動。</p>
<p>經濟援綏之意義。自其積極言之。固在於增加國防配備之力量。自其消極言之。則在於減少吾人內心之痛苦。救亡圖存。匹夫有責。舉國從同。義無二致。旣不能擐甲執兵。躬前驅之役。亦唯有輸粟貢芻。盡後方之責。猶幸綏一日之死。要當竭全力以赴。須知此舉。等於自捍頭目。非同下井救人。其性質旣超於慈善之觀念。卽輸將無問乎鉅細與頻繁。惟有家家脫𣓷。人人解囊。交鞭互策。用相敦勉。以多多益善之精神作源源不絕之匯寄。庶幾成數以集。分配得勻。邊圉可固。士氣獲振殘廢流亡。並蒙其惠。而吾人久蘊心頭之惶慮。亦得稍紓於萬一矣。</p>
<h3>日本志願兵三千赴西斑牙參戰</h3>

<p>直布羅陀　據由加狄茲今日抵此之某客傳出一可異消息、據謂加狄茲之傑里茲地方、刻正在準備安置本星期將開到參加西班牙內戰之日兵五千人云、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］此間各界人士接到直布羅陀報告、日志願兵三千名行將開抵西班牙加入叛軍作戰之訊息後、不勝驚異、認日本此舉、將使地中海局勢益趨惡化、惟上項消息迄未能加以證實、（十一日快訊社電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］此間各報聞日本志願兵三千人、行將開抵西班牙援助國民軍作戰之後、均極感興趣、并亟待日本官塲方面有所表示、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［東京］今晨東京聞五千名志願隊將開抵加狄茲參加西班牙內戰之消息、不啻如睛天之霹靂、德日兩國雖訂有反共產國際協定、但日本亳未表露有在外交上或軍事上與聞西班牙糾紛之意志、日本報紙與政治家因廣田首相對付中俄外交政策遭遇失敗、而反締結不適時宜之德日協定、故抨擊不遺餘力、由此觀之、日首相與其閣員似絕不致暗許未受訓練之志願隊赴西、續遭國人之反對也、至於曾受訓練者、如出國參戰、則須經日皇允准、似亦未必有之、日外務省稱直布羅陀傳出之消息、純係捏造云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>［東京］英法兩國半官通信社哈瓦斯路透兩社、宣傳有日本志願兵數千援助西班牙革命軍、將在西班牙西岸加狄茲及海萊斯兩地登岸、日外務省當局認此係欲利用歐洲政局展開之最惡質之反宣傳、非常憤慨、此因法蘇等左翼各國、及希望維持歐洲現狀之英國、因其所支持之西班牙政府軍最近戰事失利、故宣傳藉日德訂立防空協定誤解已加入法西斯陣營之日本已派遣義勇軍參與西班牙戰事、蓋欲藉此宣傳、惡化各國對法西斯陣營之輿論、而使戰事於政府軍有利、此可豫想而得者、卽如此次之謠言放送、蓋亦加担西班牙政府軍之歐洲各國所最初宣傳者、日外務當局對此項宣傳雖付之一笑、然若放任不理、有使日本公正之對歐外交方針、被世界誤解之虞、故有田外相於十一日電訓駐歐各地使臣探究謠言出處、同時要求關係國政府取締此種惡意之無綫播音、（十一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>英政府向五國提出新建議</h3>
<p>主張推廣監察計劃　法國表示完全贊同</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於禁止志願兵前往西班牙一項問題、英政府曾于昨晚向該國駐法意德葡俄五國大使、發出同式訓令、命其儘速將英政府之新建議、分頭通知各駐在國政府、該項訓令共分八節、摘錄如下</p>
<p>㊀各關係國政府均經表示，期望立卽採取各項辦法、以禁止志願兵前往西班牙、因此現有三項辦法、業經關係各國共同商定、禁止志願兵之辦法、應由參加各國同進實施、此其一也、以間接方式干涉西班牙內亂之整個問題、亦當積極進行辦理、以期獲得解决、此其二也、對于禁止志願兵之辦法、應建立切實有效之監察制度、此其三也、</p>
<p>㊁關於監察西班牙海陸邊境之計劃、現正由西班牙內戰當事變方加以考慮、英國政府茲建議此項監察計劃應加以推廣、凡志願兵軍事人員以及各項軍用品之海陸兩方面運抵西班牙者、均當在監察之列、</p>
<p>㊂此項監察計畫、欲求其獲得滿意之保障與有效之實施、則參加計畫之各國政府必須以眞心實意、自願履行約束而後可、英國政府相信此種條件、在實際上當可辦到、惟各關係國政府對于各項監察辦法及方式、除以上所已陳述者外、或別有見地亦未可知、倘蒙分別指示、英國政府自不勝欣幸、總之。為貫澈此項目的所提出之任何建議、英國政府無不準備立時加以考慮、此外、為監察其他各種間接干涉方式起見所提出之任何詳細建議、英國政府亦樂於加以考慮、並準備將此項建議、儘先交由不干涉辦法調整委員會加以討論、</p>
<p>㊃同時就英國政府本身之意見、以為其他各國政府致英國之復文、旣均表示－種願望、主張西班牙境內、不應再有外國志願兵及軍事人員、則此種表示、當係各國政府在其本國領土內實施禁止志願兵赴西班牙之先聲、此種禁止辦法、卽在西班牙境內監察制度完全建立之前、亦不妨加以實施也、</p>
<p>㊄英國政府擬立卽自動頒發佈告、以促一般公衆注意、使知英國臣民凡接受應募或願意應募、加入西班牙內戰任何一方之軍隊者、均屬違犯“投效外國軍隊法、”當治以應得之罪、其有在“聯合王國”領土內徵募志願兵、以赴西班牙作戰者、罪亦同、</p>
<p>㊅英國政府建議、將去年＋二月二十四日（卽英法兩國照會送出之日期、）以後關係各國間往來公文、連同本文件、－倂送交不干涉辦法調整委員會、倘各國復文對於此項建議一致同意、則英國政府當請求調整委員會、决定日期、俾各國政府於該日期、同時實施上述禁止志願兵赴西班牙之辦法、</p>
<p>㊆英國政府不欲干涉調整委員會之行動、反之、英國認為十二月二十四日英法兩國政府所提出之照會、實所以謀調整委員會工作之便利、</p>
<p>㊇務請英國駐德意法葡俄五國大使立卽將英國政府上項意見、通知各駐在國政府、並請其早日提出答復、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］英駐法大使本日午後奉英國政府調令、以該國關於禁止志願兵赴西班牙一事之新建議、面遞外交次長魏耶諾、官方人士頃宣稱、法國政府當卽向英國政府表示完全贊成此項建議、並稱法國激府準備在下星期初頭、要求國會通過法律、將禁止志願兵前往西班牙之各項辦法予以規定、而於各關係國政府商得同意之時開始實施、法國政府並擬乘機向國會宣布此項辦法、俾克促使不干涉西班牙內亂監察辦法、迅卽付諸實施云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英外部頃發表公報、喚起公衆注意、謂“一八七○年頒行之”投効外國軍隊法”所規定各節、尤其是該法律第四第五兩節、對於目前西班牙內亂均得適用、任何臣民違犯此項規定者、依法得處以二年以下之監禁或罰金、或兩刑並科”云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>經濟專家金國寳談特種現金保證辦法</h3>
<p>認為有關各方均有利益</p>
<p>自報載本市銀行公會主席陳光甫氏報告、决計推行特種現金保證辦法後、各界人士、以此事為銀行人事制度上之大改革、故均深為注意、並聞已有一二銀行卽將實行、記者特趨訪經濟專家中央銀行專門委員金國寳氏、當承發表談話如次、</p>
<p>保人制度不科學化</p>
<p>銀行行員因職務上關係、大都終日與錢幣有價證券等相接觸、銀行方面、為防止營私舞弊起見、自不能不令其提供確實可靠之保證、過去因習俗相沿、一般為行員作保者、大抵係社會上具有相當聲譽之人、惟此種人為數無幾、而社會間求人作保者、則極為衆多、故每一負有相當聲譽之人、往往為數十百人作保、夫個人之財力有限、以有限之財力、為多數人作無限之保證、其結果之不能圓滿、自在意中、晚近銀行錄用人員、大都用公開考試方法、以期甄拔眞才、其錄取之人、旣非由權勢保護而來、自不易獲得有地位之人為其作保、故往住有學識優秀徒以不獲適當之保人、終遭屏棄、</p>
<p>現金保證五大原則</p>
<p>上述僅舉其犖犖大者、已可槪見、個人保證辦法、不僅重累行員、貽誤銀行而於保人、亦屬不利、是亟應加以改革、惟過去銀行界人士雖均有種感想、但無妥善之改良、故迄未能解除上項困難、在今世歐美各國此種制度、早被淘汰、其所行之信用保險、保費極昂、於吾國情形不盡適用、近聞本埠某大銀行創議之特種現金保證辦法、其內容係採效英美銀行制度、參照我國情形而訂定由甲•乙•丙•三項保證金與連帶處分、獎勵告發等五原則所組成、規定於行員進行時、繳納三個日薪額之甲種保證金、（該項證金於離行時全數領回、存儲行中、仍可得利息、嗣後每月於薪水或儲金中、扣繳百分之二為乙種保證金、並由行方年撥若干為丙種保證金、以甲種證金之利息半數、（其利息特予提高、以半數發給行員、以免證金虚擱、）及乙丙兩種證金、合成鉅數、作為公共準備金、以備遇有行員舞弊、而該員之證金及其他所有財產不足賠償時、以之弭補、其乙種證金、性質類似信用保險之保費、但無舞弊發生仍可發還、此為體䘏行員、及引起行員切身關係而定、較之保費繳納後、不能發還、更有積極作用、是在保險之中、寓儲蓄之意較信用保險、尤勝一等、以上三項、乃着重於鞏固事後賠償方面、終防止舞弊、恐仍無大效、故復規定連帶處分、與獎勵告發兩項、以遏止舞弊之動機、其後並有於巨欵之準備金中、提成作行員福利事業、以匡助人事管理之進展、</p>
<p>團體結合防患未然</p>
<p>吾人觀上述各項規定、具密切連漀之關係、其連帶處分與乙種證金之發還、尤為含意深長、整個辦法、規劃縝密、蠲除個人利害觀念、從整個團體之利害着想、切合現代團體結合之精神、尤注意於事先之防止、在原有辦事上機械式之監督外、並可促起精神上之結合以共同合作、而達防止舞弊其必奏宏效、自可斷言、聞該辦法創議迄今、已逾時兩載、修正七次、原議者迭經博徵羣議、研討修正、已臻盡善、實行之後、行員可解除覓保之困難、在銀行方面、設遇發生舞弊情事亦有的欵可資補償、不致如向時之涉訟經年、毫無結果、而尤使一般作保者、將來不再受無事之累、實於各方均有利益、至行員初入行時、應繳三月薪額之證金、在家境清寒者、雖亦籌措非易、然數額亦屬有限、較之求人作保、實覺便易多多、故現金保證、係解除行員痛苦之唯一辦法、</p>
<p>當局賛許月內實行</p>
<p>自該辦法創議以來、實業部吳部長、頗為贊許、經濟專家立法院委員長馬寅初博士、對此曾發表談話、認為可行、並希望銀行界當局加以重視、最近銀行學會應銀行公會乏請、復歷加研討、並分函全國金融界、共同研究各方所表意見、甚為贊同、並悉經濟專家銀行週報主筆李權時博士、撰有“答客問”一文、詳加闡述、此足見各方贊助之切、與矚望之殷、現聞銀行公會以研究妥善、正計劃推行辦法、俾資從速改進保證制度、各銀行亦將羣起推行、聞已有一二銀行卽將實行、實開風氣之先、此種改革創造之精神、尤為欽佩、行見數十年來銀行界所感受保證問題之困難得以解除、吾國各種事業、過去類屬墨守成法、缺少創造精紳、此項辦法、聞屢經銀行界諸領袖公開研究、均深表贊同、足證辦法妥善完密毫無疑異、行見一行創議、各行仿效、前途展望、愈見光明、不僅我銀行界之幸、亦全社會之福也云云、</p>
<h3>日政府統制外匯後滬市日匯狂跌</h3>
<p>日商竭力維持　一時無法穩定</p>
<p>自日政府統制外匯後、滬市日匯交易突趨混亂、幸日商銀行均鉅額購進、以資維持、昨日中央銀行掛牌為日金一○三元、合國幣一百元、英商匯豐銀行掛牌為日金一○二元六角二分五、合國幣一百元、但據調查、上項掛牌、並非實際行市、實際交易則為日金一○四元五角、始合國幣百元、一時似尚不易穩定、惟聞中央銀行於上星期六、曾購進日金一二百萬元、</p>

<h3>濬浦局添造挖泥船船身雄偉世界無匹</h3>
<p>船身長度達四百英尺　英德荷船商相率投標　神灘浚工進行極順利</p>
<p>上海濬浦總局、為浚挖吳淞口外神灘、經向德國等高公司訂造巨型挖泥船“建設”號一艘、於前年四月抵滬、開始浚挖工程等情、均誌前報、記者昨訪該局總工程師查得利博士、承告訂造新船曁最近浚工進行頗詳、茲分誌於後、</p>
<p>神灘浚工異常順利</p>
<p>記者昨訪該局查總工程師、叩以神灘最近浚工、據查氏談神灘浚挖工程、自建設號巨型挖泥船、於前年自德抵滬後、工程卽於是年五月開始、迄現在止、挖起泥土、已有七百萬方碼、照預定建設號在神灘開挖泥土、一年約能挖起五百萬方碼、茲實際已超過上項數量、故工程進行、堪稱順利、</p>
<p>新船投標外商七家</p>
<p>記者繼詢以第二艘大挖泥船、自招商投標以來、迄茲已否確定承造廠商、據查氏答謂、第一艘大挖泥船、自去年招商投標以來、迄茲先後收到標函七封、計屬於英國商者三家、屬荷蘭船商者二家、屬於德國船商者二家、惟究歸何一家承造、此時尚未確定、第以德國雪高公司（按卽前建設號承造者）較有希望、</p>
<p>船型雄偉超過建設</p>
<p>記者復叩查氏以新船建造計劃、及其工作效率、是否尚較建設號為偉大而增高、據答、新船長度超過建設號四十英尺、（按建設號長度為三百六十呎、闊度超過建設號二英尺半、（建設號為六十呎）每小時挖泥量與建設號相仿、約二千五百方碼、惟吸泥力量、視建設號更形增加、</p>
<p>挖泥效率卓絕世界</p>
<p>記者未叩查氏以當建設號在德造竣時、卽有世界最大挖泥船之稱茲新船設計更超過之、信否益足冠絕全球、查氏答謂、世界有挖泥船、長於建設號者計有二艘、關於建設號者有－艘、至如長過於待造中之新船者、亦有一艘、為英國在利物涌擔任吸沙工作者、其長度達四百六十英尺、惟船型機構、均屬舊式、其挖吸力、遠不達本局特造中之新船、故以挖泥力量言之、確可執全世界挖泥船之牛耳、</p>

<p>青華中小學。經始在丁卯。位於同孚路。迄今已十載矣。初學生二十餘人。嗣學額漸增。寔不能容。乃遷於梅白格路。校舍固已擴充矣。越年久。房居停謀重建。乃遷於定興路。旣學額大增。寔不能容。乃遷於白克路即今之校舍也。夫校歷三遷。其間之締艁經營。以有是規模。自非具有熱心。曷克臻此。創辦者。桐鄕馮先生樹華也。其道德之醇乎其醇。其學識之淵乎其淵。余固諗知之。顧馮先坐在社會服務。非一日矣。孰不能言者。奚俟余之贅為。第就馮先生之辦學。尤有欲告於衆者。馮先然視學生如己之子弟。諄諄焉誨之。至於再。又至於再。不知勛。若夫課程則適應潮流。以宏其用。又使讀經。以植其基。頗聞學生之父兄。舉表歡迎。遣其子弟來學。日益增多。茲印行紀念刋。凡內幕之秩如。成績之蔚如。於此舉可以見焉。特刋成。馮先生督辭於余。於是乎述之。丙子仲冬之月。　　吳興王震</p>

<h3>本校之回顧及前瞻</h3>
<p>本校之沿革</p>
<p>青華中小學，為紀念馮公惠愍先生曁馮母惠懿夫人而設。經始於十六年春。地點在上海同孚路。時學生僅廿餘人，翌年學額卽見增加。十八年春，校舍不敷應用，乃遷於梅白格路大洋房內，學額益見增加。二十三年，復遷於定興路。自是學額陡增，校舍又不敷應用，乃遷於白克路四二八號四層大洋房內，卽今之校舍也。夫校舍迄已三遷，學生增至三百餘人，莘莘焉，祁祁焉，規模由是大備。凡圖書館之擴充，理化室之增設，國術館，乓乒室，籃球塲，排球塲，雞毛球塲，娛樂室，兒童樂園，兒童法庭，蓋已應有而盡有矣。</p>
<p>本校之校董校員</p>
<p>樹華創辦斯校，斥貲固所不恡，而校董校員延訪賢者，尤不遺餘力。校董有王一亭，杜月笙，董綬金，錢大鈞，袁顧登，鄭洪年，葛祖蘭等。是皆聲望卓著，所謂南州冠𠕤者耶。敎員有朱寶瑩，周浩，董心琴，張貫道，程餘庵，丁紹康，高臨等。朱君前清翰林，專門學校畢業。周君滬江大學畢業。董君附生師範畢業。張君附生。程君大同大學畢業。丁君斐迪大學畢業，高君聖芳濟專門畢業。諸君之舉識優越，經騐宏富，皆一時之選也。</p>
<p>青華中小學十周紀念</p>
<p>材森教溥　潘之辰題</p>
<p>本校之榮譽</p>
<p>本校歷屆畢業學生，均得考入國內著名高中。他如考入上海中國銀行，電話局，郵務管理局，稅務專門畢業派關，得有職業者，尤後先相望。叉如錄取工部局獎學金考試者，二十二年有周箕業，張祖道，梁於勞等，二十三年有羅秋生，二十四年有周元元，免費三年，書籍費亦免，尤占優異，本校童子軍，參加中國童軍第三屆大檢閱，曁第七次大露營，得“訓練有方”獎屏及獎章。內政部主辦衛生署五省衛生圖書比賽，列入最優等，得有獎狀獎品。</p>
<p>本校之預擬計劃</p>
<p>本校校舍，雖屢經遷地為良。然每屆遷徒，欲覔寬敞適用者。良非易易，蓋不知費去多少心力。始能覔得。現擬籌集基金，俟得有成數，卽當購買基地，建築校舍。</p>
<p>本校現在學制，至於初中而止。學生畢業後，不能在本校升學，尚感不便。擬添設高中部，以便初中畢業生開學。</p>
<p>本校圖書與儀器，雖已盡量購置。然圖書儀器，關係學生知識之灌輸。得多量之設備，卽得多景之知識。故尚擬積極充實。</p>
<p>本校對於學生敎課，雖已力求高䆳，然學問之道，原無止境，尚擬提高敎課，俾學生程度，益見提高。</p>
<p>本校由樹華獨力搘拄不敢告勞，尚賴邦人君子，匡我不逮。庶幾日益擴展，學校幸甚。　馮華樹謹述</p>

<h3>教育部今日播音節目</h3>

<p>收音機關　中等學校</p>
<h3>王裕凱播音演講公民訓練問題</h3>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>我今天要和諸位討論的、就是公民訓練問題、在没有講到本題以前、我先介紹兩個簡單的故事、</p>
<p>（一）一天、有一個大學教授、散歩鄉郊、碰着一個牧羊的人、問他這樣的一個問題道、『……我們「東三省」給日本人搶去了、你可道道嗎』牧羊的人想了半天、好像已經知道的樣子説、「哦、是不是祭祀用的「猪頭三牲」不見了嗎、這幾天我家裏没有祭祀、不用猪頭三牲旁人家的猪頭三牲給日本人搶去、和我有什麽關係呢、」</p>
<p>（二）記得我去年從美國回來、道經日本、曾和幾位中國留學生談天、大家都用江浙遼吉各省不同的土話互相傾談、其中有一位從東北來的學生説、「爲什麽貴國語言和敝國（指滿洲國）一樣、」</p>
<p>這兩個故事都可以使我們發生無限感慨、前者是表現中國一般大衆的「愚」、不悉民族國家爲何事、後者是暴露今日東北青年心理、已逐漸向奴隸化方面走、一般智識階級、已孔喪失其國家觀念民族意識、故雖認賊作父、已不自知、我們看了這種情形、就可知公民訓練、實在是刻不容緩的事、</p>
<p>一國的國民、經過相當訓練之後、就可以成爲一種國民性、一個國家的精神、誰都曉得是寄托在全國人民的身上、而國民性的優劣、也就可以决定一個國家前途能否發展、所以世界各國政府、對於國民性的陶冶、莫不重視、換句話説、也就是對公民訓練問題、重視異常、我現在先把日美兩國公民訓練的特點約略述其大概、然後再講到在這非常時期、中國公教方面應做的工作以及他應有的態度××先説美國、美國公民有幾個特徵、足供我們效法、</p>
<p>第一尊重勞動——中國有「勞工神聖」一句話、其實就是由美國借用來的、美國大總統羅斯福之子在農村中種田、有人懷疑他説爲什麽不到白宫裏去過「君儲」「國貳」的生活、他自己説他也是一個公民、應當自食其力、道總統有七萬五千元美金的年薪、但他的夫人、却還要自己開汽車、一般的大學生、除了讀書以外、往往去找工作做、譬如替人家擦門窗、拖地板、到飯館裏去洗盆碗、替人家洗衣服、到處都可以看見他門尊重勞動和崇尚獨立生活的好習慣、</p>
<p>第二富有朝氣——美國的公民、都很富有朝氣、不問男女、年齡雖大、但體格精神、還是很雄健、到處保持着青年時代蓬蓬勃勃的氣概、我在美國的時候、有兩個同學年紀都很老、一爲六十歳的女同學、得了博士學位、一爲六十四歳的滬江大學教授P、of.　Johnson返美繼續研究、我們教室內多半都是老生、我最初以爲他們都是教授、當他們進來上課、我總起立致敬、及後來才知彼等均是學生、道種好學不倦的精神、委實足使我們欽佩、</p>
<p>第三具有雄大宏壯精神——在我們中國建造黄河鐵橋錢塘江鐵橋以爲乃是很艱鉅偉大的工作、但在美國建造舊金山太平洋鐵橋、完成中美航程、其偉大還不知幾倍中國上海國際飯店二十二層高以爲是了不起在紐約却很普通、最高達一百零二層呢有人以爲地球上的人如與火星上的人交通、須用大砲射去、結果竟有很多人報名參加、這都可以看到美國人的習氣、充滿著要執世界牛耳的氣魄、（未完）</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>三品劇漲停市　紗花補空尤急</p>
<p>金雞漲三元左右　標花亦跳六七角</p>
<p>紗市晨平午漲、氣勢轉趨高翔、蓋以大阪三品漲風劇烈、上海市塲受其影響、午後市上傳言紛紜、謂三品紗穿出三百元外、於是浮空活動抵補、市盤歩歩向上、但現紗生意淸淡、十支組紗更缺乏銷塲、大阪來電云、前市收盤本定一點十分開拍、午後市塲停市、未曾開拍云、</p>
<p>印商獨進二月標紗前方開盤、各月一律上漲、因大阪三品紗復漲八·九·元至十元、人氣激昂、浮空抵補、漲風又起但二盤以後、聞現紗銷塲淸淡、而現紗市情平庸、又説日滙暗盤大長、故新買者仍缺乏興趣、惟二十二號錦昌獨進二月期、據云代印商購進、然廠方套出十支粗紗殊夥也、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價均漲二·七角、午後開盤市况稍帶堅挺、因前市三品紗收盤價未到、傳言孔繁、遠期上漲、但有一部份云日滙或有變化、現紗交易不旺、迨至收盤、聞大阪三品來電停市、散空扒補尤急、漲力益强、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲一元半至三元、查賣出益昶三千三百包、大昶八百包、福康一千一百包、同和一千五百五十包、泰昌一千一百五十包、長豐六百五十包、恒昌一千包、生源一千零五十包、愼昌六百五十包、買進賡豐五千三百包、同孚七百包、錦昌一千包、恒昌一千二百包、合興一千四百包、恊成一千四百包、豐泰七百包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<p>標花買氣極濃標花前市開盤、美棉微見上升、印棉軟化、惟大阪三品花飛漲二三元、市塲人心激動後日滙遠期有放長説、故人氣尚和平、新買者未見踴躍、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一角至一角半、午後開盤因三品花市電報未到、議論紛紛、買氣尤濃、市價歩歩上升、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲三角半至五角半、查賣出源興昌一千四百担、新昶三千一百担、聚興二千九百担、源大一千三百担、生源五千一百担、錦昌二千二百担、明德一千六百担、瑞大一千五百担、益昶三千七百担、大昌成一千六百担、買進裕大三千二百担、元一一千担、吉豐二千担、興昌三千二百担、愼記四千四百担、長豐三千一百担、潤康五千二百担、豐泰七千二百担、福康一千五六百担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>棉布色色跌價</p>
<p>結賬期近交易淸</p>
<p>新牌子貨品質雜</p>

<h3>油市</h3>
<p>荳油慘跌八九角</p>
<p>終不能脱離大連牽制</p>
<p>近日荳油市况、因銷塲平淡、大連市價雖漲多跌少、但人心不振、市面僵持一星期之久、昨聞得大連市價下挫、始見開出、行情比七天前之價（四日）慘跌八九角不等、計做開本廠油二百件、輪船牛莊油四百五十件、輪船大連油一百件、輪船沙河歧山油五十件、沙船烟台歧山油一百件、前途趨勢、如去路不暢、或有續修可能、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>期麥市氣午盤突挫</p>
<p>現貨廠辦不貪</p>
<p>麵粉銷路亦淸</p>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤、各月份市面、呈先穩繼跌之勢、以洋麥報價、美坎兩處、均回漲五角零、故開價後、人心尚定、較前週收價、計漲一分、不過總結賬期日近、各路交易、無形停頓、有實貨之客户、對近期均思套售、致人心甚平、迨至下午開盤、市氣突軟、因現麥廠需不查、喊價又低、故本月份首先挫落、較上午即跌五六分、遠期各月份、則外行多頭、羣起了結、致跌勢既暴、交易亦暢、此種情形、實因粉銷不活、不得不自然趨跌也、現麥市面、見交甚淸、價亦鬆五分、開天台麥六元五角一分至五角、紹興麥六元四角八分、次爲四角、計二千餘包、由阜豐辦去云、</p>
<p>期粉稍見回振</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤、各月份又呈回振之態、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、各好五角零、故開價時、近遠期較前週收盤、均漲三四分右左、惟總結賬爲期不遠、各路客户、大都觀望、祇聞北平帮尚有續進、不過一部分多頭、趁高回脱、致二盤以下、歩趨平落、廹至下午開盤、初以實銷不振、小麥喊價亦平、各月份曾較小一二分、後則出入兩稀、外行略進、又稍挺住、照目下淸形、如果北銷停滯、本月份之結果、恐有别低之勢云、</p>
<p>粤方採辦糙秈甚暢</p>

<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源略稀、約念餘號、所存仍厚、市上各貨去胃依然淸淡、而客方因産區價仍昂貴、意欲停售、後市白粳店方取巧、稍有去化、兼之零星堆户亦略進辦、市價早市價小一二角、午市轉挺、早稻小一角、薄稻小一二角、羊杜埠尖價疲小數分、白元價軟五六分、陰元貨少、價形堅立、後市收盤、各貨價形均見定勢、</p>

<p>祁紅之産銷製（一日續）</p>
<p>（五）本年之茶價</p>
<p>往年祁茶新茶上市，約在五月中旬，本年以皖贛兩省當局，實施統制祁寗紅茶之運銷，上海茶棧，羣起反對，因之新茶雖已到滬，洋行因糾紛未息，迄未購辦，遲至五月二十九日，始行議價開盤，正式成交錄簿，始自三十日。本年祁紅頭批茶價，最高每市担達二百七十五元，餘則價在二百七十元以下，最低價，僅四十二元。二批茶最高價爲二四○元，最低價僅二八。五元。三批茶最高價達一七五元，最低價爲二三元。四批茶最高爲九○元，最低一八元。花香最高價爲四二元，最低爲一二元。價格相差之巨，實堪驚。</p>
<p>以茶價論，無論何批紅茶，以祁門茶業改良塲之改良紅茶，得價最高。其他具有製茶經騐之茶商，所製之茶，得價亦稱不惡。以區域論，祁門茶之價格，較浮至爲高，如祁紅之頭批茶，最高價售至二七五元，浮粱爲二二○元，至德僅一一七元，相差之巨，可以概見。其他二三批茶，售價差額，較頭批茶爲少，惟趨勢則同。換言之，即至德及貴池紅茶價格最低浮梁次之，而祁門茶價最高。證以茶業之品質，所感亦同。此蓋由於至德及浮梁採摘較遲，故無論茶葉之外表色香味及葉底均遜於祁門也</p>
<p>然祁門境內所産之茶，並非均能優於浮至，且有次於浮至茶者。故上述僅爲一般而言，至於製茶品質之優劣，及市價之高低，全恃茶號製茶經騐以爲斷。故防杜劣茶之發生，不在提倡某一茶區之生産，應重視茶號之資本及經騐，防止濫設。至於浮至兩縣，尤應提倡嫩製，即社會人士及購買者，對於浮至之茶，似不應固執成見，當以品質爲前題，出價競買，則浮至之茶業，庶可有所發展，祁紅茶之品質，亦可隨競爭而改進矣。</p>
<p>一般而言，高山茶之品質較優於低山茶，祁區各地紅茶品質之不同，故有謂乃受天然環境之影響。查祁區之氣温，濕度及雨量，僅祁門南鄉平里茶業改良塲歷年有所記載，至於浮至各縣，則無此項記錄，未敢據爲推測。至於各區海拔，（地勢高度）本年就調查經過區域，稍加測量，祁門西南鄉産茶最多處之海拔，通常在一百六十公尺至三○○公尺間。北鄉高嶺，且達七五○公尺，然産茶不多。至於浮梁北鄉與祁縣毘連之處，海拔亦在二○○公尺以上。至德上中下三鄉，海拔較低，約在一五○公尺。至德茶之品質，其較次之原因，是否全屬於此，在未研究之前，不能斷定。惟高山之茶，常得雲霧之滋澤，似較低山茶香氣爲高。至德茶較爲低下者，殆爲此歟，此則更有待於繼續研究也。</p>
<p>總之，海拔高處，雖可産生良好之原料，但未必即能製造優良之紅茶，此點已於上文言之。查良好之毛茶原料，每因耽擱過久或茶號精製不愼而劣變，故海拔雖高，成茶之品質，並不一律良好。</p>
<p>本年祁紅價格之高，爲民國二十年後之第一年，夷考祁紅茶價所以轉好之原因，不外有二：</p>
<p>一對外匯價，自實行法幣政策後，約縮百分之三○，因之華茶市價，有增加百分之三○之可能。</p>
<p>二由於統一運銷之收效。</p>
<p>上列二端，實爲祁紅價格好轉之原因，而後者尤有助於茶價之提高。可以言之？本年匯價既縮，按理茶價當可一般提高，惟揆諸事實，則有所不然，紅茶除祁寗茶外，市價未見上漲，即各種綠茶價格，亦幾與去　相若，故祁寗紅茶價格之獨高，非全爲匯價减縮之關係，而由於統一運銷之功。苟無皖贛兩省之統一運銷，則洋商對於茶棧，仍可施行各個擊破之政策，遂其壓抑價格之目的，茶棧乃代內地茶號售茶之機關，得失無關痛癢，然內地茶商苦矣。茶棧反對統制，雖屬不該，然由爭存而言，亦情由可原；乃少數茶號，盲目景從，破壞政府之統制，誠不知是何居心。</p>
<p>本年祁紅茶價雖高，但獲普價者不多，餘均價在七八十元，少則四五十元。惟本年祁區毛茶山價，因各號壓價之故，較歷年爲低。頭批成茶之成本，約在一○○元至一二○元，二批茶約六七十元，三批茶四五十元，四批茶僅三四十元，平均精茶成本，每市担約爲六十元。此僅就祁門而言，至於浮至紅茶，成本自更爲廉，蓋毛茶山價，不若祁門爲高也。</p>
<p>祁紅成本低而售價高，故祁區茶號，除少數因製茶劣變，間有虧蝕外，大抵均有利可圖，此實近年來稀有之佳音也。</p>
<p>（六）紅茶將來之出路</p>
<p>推銷國産之前提，爲『價廉物美，』茶葉已非我國獨占之農産，印錫荷印産銷之紅茶，且我較國爲多；故我國茶葉前途之生機，尤賴於價廉質美之品，以喎存於世界市塲。願祁紅茶之品質，猶未達預期之佳美，而價各之昻，且在印錫紅茶以上者，是欲引起歟美人士之注意，以增加銷路，已戞乎其難。值兹不景氣之狂潮，瀰漫全球，出高價以購茶者，本屬不多。然人類無不祈求生活之改良，即飲用茶葉亦希出最低之代價，而獲相當美滿之品質。故祁紅茶如欲推廣銷路，則减低價格，實與改善品質同關重要也。國産紅茶之在英國市塲者，祇祁紅茶可以單獨銷售，如兩湖紅茶，僅能拚混於印錫茶內出售，故祁紅茶之銷路，較能獨立而有希望，苟就品質成本售價及推銷方面，加以改善，固不難恢復昔日祁紅茶之盛况而上之也。（完）</p>

<h3>大上海素描</h3>
<p>— （方正）</p>
<p>石路巡禮</p>
<p>石路是窮人唯一的服裝機關，因為在上海做件衣服，是很不容易的，料子旣貴，做工又大，而且又麻煩！可是石路上一切都為貧民解決了，只要揀着與自己身材相仿的衣服，就可隨時穿在身上，旣簡便又經濟，所以上海所謂的“老門檻”的衣服，總是石路上揀來的居多。</p>
<p>昨天跟着朋友，在石路上巡行了一週，那裏照例挂出许多誘人的冬衣，馬褲呢大衣，皮袍子，駱駝絨袍子棉褲，絨線短衫，圍巾……總之，應有盡有，不勝枚舉。同時在他們，衣莊，所謂的“灘台”前，喊出特別便宜的犧牲品，於是引起許多穿短衣的勞働者和穿夾袍子單長衫的流浪兒，擠着，看着，希冀獲得“價廉物美”的禦寒品。但有些却是為了生活的“扒兒掱，因為當人們全神貫注在便宜貨上時，他們就施展他神通的本領，暗中把你的皮夾竊取而去，所以凡是“老門檻”對這有相當的提防的。</p>
<p>我因為淘件駱駝絨袍竟淘了十餘家，才在一家雙開間的大提莊裏找到對象了。</p>
<p>這衣服面子太新，恐怕不是原當貨吧？我彷“老門檻”的口氣問衣莊夥計。</p>
<p>“先生：格件衣裳，十足道地是原當貨，儂看，格不是典當裏的痕跡麼？”他把胸前的疊跡指給我看。</p>
<p>據“老門檻”說，買衣服要原當貨，因為是人穿的，當滿在典當裏，，料子和做工都比較考究。衣服揀成了，價錢呢？據夥計說十四兩，（這是衣莊的規則，每兩十角計算，實價九元八角）。我因為比較自製便宜，結果交易成功了。</p>
<p>晚上穿着這袍子回來，在馬路上，我驕傲他斜視着穿單長衫的同行者。但是心頭却像青鉛一般的沉重。</p>
<h3>東方的聖彼得堡之類</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>十年之前，在我們這個有東方巴黎之號的上海，有一個區域，叫做“東方的聖彼得堡，”是在法租界的西部，現在有神秘之街之號的霞飛路左近。那時，從俄國流浪出來，而託足在上海的白俄，幾乎全都僦居在那裏，於是俄國式的飯店，書店，雜貨店，等，風起雲湧的在本來十分寂寞的霞飛路上出現着，而法國型的霞飛路上，便充滿着俄國風味。於是乎大家都把霞飛路，呼作為東方的聖彼得堡。</p>
<p>十年一個小滄桑，東方的聖波得堡也不能逃出這個公式，由盛而衰了。因為在這十年中，東方的聖彼得堡中的俄人，較諸十年之前，已僅存着上之一二•而自一二八的砲聲停止之後，北四川路上的－切神秘窟，大部分都已搬上了霞飛路，於是北四川路原有的誘人的別名，“神祕之街”，也給搬上了霞飛路去。所以現在任誰提起了霞飛路，便都會很自然地說是“神秘之街”，而大家都把“東方的聖彼得堡，”淡然地遺忘掉了。</p>
<p>東方的聖彼得堡，在這十年中，雖是逐漸地被人遺忘了，但在虹口區，却在這十年中，出現了一個所謂“小東京•”這個所謂“小東京，”是東自三角小菜塲起，西至沈家灣之中的短短一段吳淞路。這一道街上，本來是有不少某國商店的，自從一二八的砲火，毀滅了北四川路之後，吳淞路上的某國商店的市招，是更密了，據說，現在的所謂“小東京”，某國商店，已佔着十分之八以上。若是不怎麼注意地，在那區域中溜過，準會在眼光中，所接觸的，完全是某國化的色彩的刺激，而忘却着自己是尚還置身於上海。</p>
<p>一二八之後，在某一個小康時期中，據說，上海的小東京，曾有過一個非常的繁榮的。但是自從這一二年來，不幸事件，不絕的發現之後，小東京的繁榮，是日趨衰退了。往常，晚飯之後的熱鬧情形，是給保護僑民安全的鋼盔槍刺，所呑噬掉了。雖然在小東京中行走着的中國人，現在還有，某國人，還是那麼的笑容可掬，十分和氣地歡迎着華人顧客的光臨，然而比了二年之前，也已有些兒不堪回首話當年了。</p>
<p>東方的聖彼得堡，是已成陳迹了，小東京，也日顯着冷落了，愛好着異國情調的上海人，今後不知將在那裏，再造成一個未來的富有異國情調的繁盛中心呢？</p>
<h3>文廟路</h3>
<p>— 石划</p>
<p>在星期六，或日的下午，看見整千整百的人，向那動物園，或文廟的門口擁去。雖然裏面已經擠滿了人；門口已經擠滿了人在搶着買票（動物園售門票六枚），然而打中華路，蓬萊路·文廟路（北段）擁來的人，還是那麼的多，有時簡直會使你走都走不通呢。</p>
<p>這人羣裏包括了：到星期日才有休息的小商人，到上海來玩的“鄕下人”……總之一句話農工商學兵，老人，小孩，男子，女子，長的，矮的，瘦的，肥的色色俱備，樣樣皆全。有時還有些洋人，坐了汽車來參觀呢！</p>
<p>我敢大膽的說一句：“星期六日的文廟路是上海人的集散地。</p>
<p>在平日，雖則沒有如此的人多，然而熱鬧是不減於星期六日的。－過四句鐘，成隊的才放學的學生們，自然而然的會走向文廟路來的。這時的文廟路變成為男女學生追逐的塲所了。女學生們手提着皮書包，三個，五個一羣的談着校裏的新聞。男學生們：手裏挾着厚厚的洋裝書，制服燙得筆挺的，也是三五個一羣，他們談着，（密斯陳沒回信啦！”：“朱×芳昨天跟老林在金城呢。”……之類。</p>
<p>“斯密王，信收到了嗎！”一個男學生追着剛走過面前的一個女學生問。</p>
<p>“……”對方沒有回答，祇把頭垂得更低了些。</p>
<p>“……怎麼沒有回信呢！”男學生又進一步問。</p>
<p>女學生對男學生白了白眼，接着加緊脚步逃了。男學生這才沒趣的退了回來。</p>
<p>約莫過了五點鐘，人才慢慢地稀了下來，文廟裏搖着關門的鈴。天色也慢慢的慢慢的黑了下來，終於進入了夜的階段。夜間的文廟路才冷靜得要命，幾乎找不出會有幾個行路人，祇有那路旁的法國梧桐的落葉，密密的在路上飄着，代替了白天裏的行人。</p>
<h3>衣橱脫險記（中）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>法國母女的俠行</p>
<p>到了家裏，便替福勒氏備了些餐品，可憐福勒氏露宿深林中四個多月，今才舒舒服服地坐在屋內，飽餐了一頓。巴斯康氏因為自己的住屋很小，沒有可以藏匿福勒氏的地方，於是又將這英兵送到他岳母戈培爾夫人家裏。那邊房屋較大還容易想法兒藏匿。但是她家中的生活，並不寬裕，平日靠她的一個女兒安琪爾在織廠工作過活，現在這個織廠已被德軍拆毀，所以安琪爾只在家中靠了一架縫衣機器，養活她的母親和妹妹，今再添上這位生客所需的糧食，不免更見拮据。安琪爾却並不因此担憂，情願努力工作，應付這個困難。所可慮的，窩藏敵兵，如被德兵發覺，各人縱不處死刑，也要嘗嘗鐵窗的風味。這却怎麽辦呢？安琪爾忽然計上心頭，大呼道：“有了！衣橱，衣橱•”這口衣橱放在底層一間室內的壁角，高約五呎半，中分兩隔，一邊藏些零物，一邊可掛衣服。於是便把衣服取出，請福勒氏入內。這口衣橱後來被查理斯爵士購得，贈給帝國戰爭博物館，現在還陳列在館中哩。</p>
<p>後幾年，福勒氏對人說道：“那時為臨時救急起見，我只能勉從主人的好意，屈伏在衣橱裏。起初以為不過藏匿一兩日，後來知道沒有脫險的方法，倘被發覺，自己性命不打緊，還要連累主人，所以我無可奈何只能忍受痛苦，長伏在裏面了”。</p>
<p>自從福勒氏藏在衣橱以後，各人都提心吊胆，日夜祈禱，祕密不被人窺破，福勒氏有重見天日的一天。但是意外之險，却隨時發生。有－天，戈夫人奉到命令，說有德兵八名要在她家裏借住幾天。軍令是不能違拗的，於是戈夫人母女急忙佈置妥貼，以免露出破綻。因此德兵來時，雖常常坐在室中距離衣橱數呎之處，竟未察覺衣橱裏藏着一個敵兵。據福勒氏後來告人，當時別的不怕，只怕咳嗽，有－次，忽要打噴嚏，用力忍住，才免敗露，那眞險啊。</p>
<p>光陰迅速，福勒氏藏在衣橱中，轉瞬已約十八個月。忽傳下軍令，要收用戈夫人住屋的全部，令戈夫人限期遷讓。於是戈夫人便在近邊租了一屋，豫備遷栘。但是這位英兵怎麼安置呢？搬家必須在白天裏，福勒氏却除在夜裏，不敢外出。後來各人商定，仍令福勒氏藏在衣橱裏，連人搬移。巴斯康氏便邀了一位知己的伐木同伴，前來帮忙，兩人用盡氣力，才把這口衣橱搬出室外。這時忽有－個身强力壯的德兵匆匆下樓，望見兩人滿頭大汗，便奔上前來，大呼道：（讓我來助你們－臂之力，哎喲·怎麼這重啊！“戈夫人面不變色，從容答道：“是啊，我把所有的重東西，盡堆在裏面”。叉說道：“先生，請你不要把橱門打開，因為裏面放着不少玻璃物件。”</p>
<h3>外灘公園踏雪</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>在風雪之中，我鼓了勇氣，放寬了腳步，凸出了肚皮，向黃浦江濱走去，竟一些不覺得寒冷。在黃浦灘路上面，雪花是紛紛的飄下，馬路上車馬比平時少了許多，行人也還沒有平常的多，雖然電車，公共汽車還是照了規定的時刻在不斷的來往，但搭客呢，顯然已減少許多，遠沒有平時的擁擠。江邊的草地上面，已鋪着層白雪，沿江除了偶然有幾個苦力在行走之外，也不見其他的行人。市輪渡每次傍岸，搭客的上下，祇是零星的幾個。</p>
<p>我走到鐵欄杆的旁邊，向江心老遠的望去，浦江中來往的船隻，正和馬路上面一樣，比平日少去許多。西北風一陣陣的打落到黃浦江心，掀起了一個個呑舟的巨浪，雪落在岸上，雖然會囤積起來，可是跌進了黃浦江中，就看不見什麼早已被水征服而溶化了。江心停泊的外艦，巨輪，上面積有一層白雪，也隱約的可以看出。再看到浦東，所有的工廠，房屋，為了天空中有雪花在紛飛，什麼都辨不清楚，祇看見一些糢糊的黑影而已。</p>
<p>靠江邊的一排鐵梗椅上，平時呢，也老是坐滿了人，可是下雪的時候，再沒有人坐着閒眺浦江風景，留着一張張空椅，堆滿了白雪·天空的雪花紛紛的飄下，落在走道上面，立刻就要溶化，但落在草地上面吧，就會堆積起來，把地上枯黃的乾草染成了一片白色。向滿個園子一望，所有的亭子，嘖水池，假山廠，紀念碑，什麼都被雪遮蓋了，改變了本來的顏色，有幾株低矮的常綠樹，像冬青扁柏之類，蓋了白雪，綠白相間，看去更是可愛。</p>
<p>風是愈刮愈緊，雪也越下越大，公園中獨巡的遊客，身上已感到有些冷氣，再不能久留了。走吧？於是我在園中兜了一圈，便回了出來，這時候天已傍晚，黃浦江邊的高樓大厦，在白雪輕飛中祇看見一些糢糊的影像，連得海關大鐘也看不清楚，就是電燈的光力，也似乎比平常薄弱了許多。在大雪中回到家裏，妻問我這麼寒冷的天氣到江邊去看雪，身上覺得冷嗎？我乾脆的答道：“這樣的雪要覺得冷，人家在冰天雪地中抗敵是怎樣呢？”</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十回（素帕奇纒綿奇文鑄錯黄花對憔悴秋信添愁）</p>
<p>在他這些話裏，真給予了國器一種莫大的安慰。心裏也就想着，有了夢蘭這麽一個人，作終身伴侣也好，作朋友也好，就是這樣一個文字往來，自己作品的讀者也好，在這一生實在是一種極可安慰的事情。自己是一位文字苦工，所得的僅僅是母親仁慈之愛。朋友雖有幾個，各人身世不同，各人性情不同，各人所學又不同，總難沉瀣一氣，成個刎頸之交。現在有了夢蘭這個人，這個缺憾就彌補了。想到了這裏，也就覺得精神煥發，於是坐到桌子邊，陳設紙筆，文不加點的寫了一篇非文非詩的散句。那文字是：</p>
<p>我之精神爲伊而興奮，我之思想爲伊而敏鋭，我之生活爲伊而甜蜜，我之環境爲伊而繁榮。我亦不解伊何以如此有大造於我。但我經伊淸朗之雙眸一照，便如十字之架，加福於我靈魂，楊枝之水，加潤於我肺腑。我對伊尊敬之則如佛，而不見其嚴肅。我對伊愛好的則如花，而不見其嬌艷。我對伊獨賞之則如月，而不見其遥遠。我對伊新近之則如雪，而不見其寒冷，總之，我之一切，已爲伊所支配，但覺不識此人以前，我是一種人。識此人以後，我又是一種人。我何故如此，我不自知，唯有問之於造化。然而我固未與伊一通語言也。</p>
<p>自己文思洶湧的一口氣寫着也不知道怎麽，就寫了這多，直到寫到那個也字，把語完足，方放下筆來。自己重看了一遍，也彷彿得意。便微微的笑了。因爲是一時高興所寫，不忍丢了，也没怎樣的去考慮，把這張紙折疊着，隨手放在抽屜裏。當日下午，因爲一些别的事牽扯，把這事擱下。到了次日，更忘記了。至於夢蘭的信，因爲已得着他的報告，由郵政局寄信去，很是危險，因之自寫好了一封信也放在抽屜裏，並没有寄出去。自己心裏，也就想着，友梅既是留下了這張字條，總會日日來的，且等着罷。（一二一）</p>
<h3>蘇州河上剪影</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>天冷了。早晨，從溫暖的被窩裏爬起來，揉了揉惺松的睡眼，穿上那冰冷的衣服，嘴唇和牙齒却捉對兒的打起架來，身體也彷彿是一根顫動的弦索似地顫慄個不住了。草草地漱洗了－回，便挾着－本書，迎着那清晨的寒風，沿着蘇州河濱闖去。但朝霧是非常的濃厚，彌漫着整個大都會的早晨，一切景物都在這霧幕下隱蔽着，卽是在一丈以外的東西也不容易辨認出來。</p>
<p>轆轆轆的車輪聲，衝破了空間的靜穆，但那白迷迷的烟樣霧氣是越壓越低，低得幾乎連自己也看不清自己；一輛一輛的電車和卡車，却早已拖着了個笨重的身體在馬路當中游泳了。白渡橋畔，一座乳黃色的摩天樓，隱約地出現在空際，它彷彿像一個美麗的少女，披上了一襲輕紗，怪可愛地站在那兒。憧憧的人影在橋欄邊幽幽地移動着，幾艘內河輪船吼着尖銳的怪聲，使得凝固的長空也起了裂痕，但那小火輪却在這濃霧下面駛過了白渡輪，向着霧的江面上前進了。</p>
<p>蘇州河與日暉港，這是兩條同樣重要的內港尤其是蘇州河，它像一條腰帶似的橫亙在公共租界的中間，把－個公共租界劃分了南北兩區，而且自從一二八滬變以後，那條蘇州河便成了安危的鴻溝了。</p>
<p>在那兒，南岸開設着許多行號，和許多內河輪船局；每天早上或傍晚，老閘橋的菜市和頭壩上的山地貨行會照例地活躍的。河中的小火輪和快船只是一天到晚的忙碌着，出的，進的，空的，滿的，點綴得這河面上頗不寂寞。它好像是這都市裏的條血脈，只要它停止了跳動，那個包容着無盡的幸福與罪惡，悽苦和快樂的都市，也會隨着死去的一樣。</p>
<p>照例，當每天的傍晚，靠近自來水橋及乍浦路的兩段中間，總有許多空船來停泊在這兒的，它們總是那麼密密地排列着，擠得連一點兒𨻶罅全沒有。晚炊的時候，每條船尾巴上吐着一縷白烟，看那無數條白烟裊裊地在河面上結合起來；末了，终於在那流波影裏消失了。晚飯後，他們有的搭了布篷，便伸直着膀子在平基面上躺了有的却圍着一盞幽暗的桅燈，在船梢上玩起紙牌來。他們這種悠閒的生活，彷彿意識到目前正還是一個太平世界的景象，對於國難的嚴重，生活的痛苦，他們好像都不曾想到。可是當我睜眼望望黃浦江上的浪濤，側耳聽聽華北的吶喊，不禁使自已有點兒茫然了。</p>

<h3>由衛生行政機構改革談到所謂中西醫問題（上）</h3>
<p>— 花新人</p>
<p>學術無境界，所以根本就用不着將醫學劃分爲「中西」醫，同樣的在事業的立塲在學術的研究上，只要是爲人類謀福利以大衆爲前提，我們便應該互信共諒的合作，所以我們不應有中西醫的名稱和界限存在，更進一歩的説在現階段中也决不能保留這種封建的濃厚色彩。</p>
<p>由中西醫名稱的分歧，正表現了我們民族的劣根性，因爲我們應該求合理的進歩，而不能容固執的退化底保守，所以中西醫的名稱在學理上根本不能存在，而當明顯的劃分爲「屬科學的與非科學，」我認爲這是正確的。</p>
<p>我們對於一切事的認識應拿理智去分析，而不應情感去否决，尤其是對於全民的保健工作，更當用强有力的理智去鑑别，用主觀是不能判定中西醫的存毁，而且更不能以「人」爲對象作單位，在治療學上去决定中西醫的命運所以中西醫學的存毁問題應由學理上去下定論，這是對的。</p>
<p>中國醫學自有其歷史的估價，但所堪慨嘆者即中國醫業自神農嚐百草至今日實用的本草網目止，未曾有過改進，這就是所謂中國醫藥失去了含科學的前進的研究，脱離了時代的輪軸，所謂學問之道不進則退，換句話説，「固執的保守」是腐化的是落伍的，只有「迎頭趕上」纔是前進的合科的，在目前我們所選擇走的路是否「迎頭趕上」抑「固執的保守。」？</p>
<p>目前有一部份人主張將衛生行政機構加以改革列舉理由，但據事實與須要言之，目前吾國之衛生行政機構尚談不到改革，衛生工作是保衛全民生命之事業其職責直接對人民生命負責，簡接對於民族盛衰有關所以衛生事業是一樣學術研究和科學的工作，並不是一種權利爭奪的機構，過去吾國民衆，因對衛生素缺乏信任，而政府諸公又不願加以提倡，所以乃形成了現在民族的衰弱，人民體力的貧乏，死亡率的高超，據統計報告，吾國一年平均死亡爲一千二百萬人，因超格死亡之經濟損失爲國幣三十萬萬元，傳染病死亡百分比是四三·三％—日本爲二九·○％由此足證明現實內在環境中對於衛生工作是廹切需要的，而現階段中所發生之嚴重問題，並不是在衛生行政機構組織的改革，而是在如何充實與發展國內衛生事業，也更不是目光釘對着西醫可做署長中醫亦可任部長的權利劃分，而是要想法去怎樣實施公醫建設？如何中醫科學化的研究？我想在事業的發展在民衆的福利上是應該互信合作的來致力於公醫建設，再根據一種理由，一般人都感覺目前中國衛生行政機構是徧重於西醫，而將中醫擠在綫外，因此乃引起反感而主張實際的改革，這多少是患了主觀上的毛病，若果此次倡議改革之原子是側重於權力爭奪方面的論爭，那就是走上了極端矛盾的歧路，因爲這種口號是發生在精神與物質的利害相一致，而犧牲和忽略了民衆的福利，所以雖倡議改革但失敗是無疑的，十幾年來中西醫之間，曾自動地劃了洪濤，標榜有「各自爲政」的學説，另立了許多門户之見，在許多次的論爭中感情則日趨疏隔，因此我想倡議衛生行政機構改革者之意識應從根本原因着想，否則在口頭上反覆吟誦作意氣之爭執，鼓其如簧之舌，施以巧妙僞弄欺騙之手段互相傾軋互相中傷，而所謂應用「遠交近攻」的傳統政策，必定是要招致意外的失敗，所以要真正地純正的倡議衛生行政機構改革來充實全民保健工作的話，我看先决的條件是中西醫界的調整，和根絶互相嫉視中傷頃軋的主見底行動，要是不由此點着手而僅僅是在權利劃分作爭論的原子這種重彈舊調，其結果不單是坐失機宜，而且將兩敗俱傷，更使民族與病家不堪其命了，倡議衛生行政，機構改革的主要目標是署長與副署長的問題，吾國自有衛生行政以來由部而改爲署縮小範圍者數次，而大都亦以此全民保健工作爲官缺，所謂預防工作保健工作成績毫無，近年來衛生雖有部而縮爲署由內政部轉爲行政院其工作則有目共睹，經負責者滲澹經營故各項工作均進行頗速，在衛生實騐處中，尤注重於各項實騐研究工作，其最有成效者爲開創公共衛生人員訓練所，培植下級幹部人員，在國家經費困難中，衛生行政當局罷艱苦奮鬥，達到目前之成績亦非易事，由此足證明現在的衛生行政當局正埋頭苦幹研究，正傾其全力來强化國防衛生設備，和加强全民保健工作，可是在此，我們要問，造成衛生行政機構改革的局面競競於勢力擴張，使中西醫界使衛生事業的命運陷於必死的抗底狀態中是不是出於一種須要，是否又出於至誠呢？無疑的衛生事業並不能作孤注之一擲，也並不能讓何部份人抱有蠻幹的野心，更不能容許任何部份存有極大的威脅來企圖作大規模的侵佔，這理由並不去説目前西醫在國內的地位已維繫着全國的向心力，而使中醫只好斷絶復仇的美夢，我想假若中西醫如果真的永久是站在對抗的地位其損失當然是不貲，即對於全民保健也要感到莫大的影響，所以促進中西醫的恊調是目前當務之急，而行政機構改革却在其次呀！</p>
<h3>談癌（二）</h3>
<p>— 小卒</p>
<p>考癌字的來源，我們丢開力學不講，推測其引用的起意，當係象形取義二者兼有。言所患之物，形性若癌也。就癌腫外表觀之，則此字之取義，與此字之可斷言爲新醫所稱之癌腫，殆無義疑。再查西説癌腫二字，在拉丁文爲Garcinoma德云Krebs，英云Cancer，其取義亦在象形與，取義之間。言此物之局部蔓延有似蟹足之伸張，善於横行也，（原爲各種慢性潰痬之總稱醫）舊醫學大辭典載，癌字解釋，爲言此物係腫塊面多突而不平滑，其性則堅如石云云。詞源上則無所記載，總之這個字的來源，中西二方，不謀而合，都緣於象形取義二者，不過一則偏重形態，一則偏重行動而已。好在這事無關宏旨，主要的問題，還是這麽呌做癌？新醫對此的見解是。</p>
<p>癌是一種與原來同樣的細胞嬗遞而來，性質逈異，而具有自主的生活力的新生細胞組織。這種細胞組織，在人身各種組織發展維持着均衡勢力的時候，不會滋生，一旦産生後，身體各部份的均勢既毁，新生物則單獨發揚，邁進無覊，其所生影響，亦即爲任何一種癌所自來的細胞組織的，質的，量的，與功能的缺憾，跟其它連帶着的牽累。也就是他所造成的病家。簡單明瞭的説，癌是一種新生物，這種新生物的本質，就是人身組合中任何一種上皮細胞系組織。在某一種情形下，失掉了他平常的生活方針，走入歧途。不但把他本身糟蹋，連得其他跟他接近的鄰居，也一齊帶壞，更能够憑藉交通路綫的便利，移入較遠區域，滋生繁殖，把所到之處，也連累着做了他的犧牲品，變成他的同類。爲着他們的生活進展，就是身體康健的障害，所以各種機能漸漸地消失，而形成不可救藥的病態。拿國家政治情來做了比例罷！癌之爲物，等於我國數年前大舉團勦，現在還在零星會勦的匪類。他們也是好好的老百姓，一朝變態而失却其原來的性質與功能，成爲有害無益的份子集團，斵喪着國家的元氣，形成國家的病症。這裏只差一點不同，就是匪類的肇端，有原因可尋，設法予以糾正後，仍舊可以回復他本性。重做於國家有用的份子。在癌的這邊，他肇端的原因，既至今還是没有證實的理論，并且一經變起，再圖設法回復，是絶無僅有的事情（祗有自行消滅的可能）這也許在將來也有可能的一日吧！</p>
<p>癌的定義（假定的）既如上述，接着要知道的，當然是癌的本身形態和組織了。癌之處於皮膚外表者，多作結節形，久則潰爛，有則作乳嘴瘤狀，其在內臟者，則恒爲浸潤，及結節形巨核。病理組織學告訴我們，癌腫的主要成份，當然係癌腫細胞。集居一處，中間雜以結締組織，爲營養品輸送之道，癌細胞的形態與性質，並非獨出。他跟原發地的細胞的差别只是較小而不整形。最要點，還在細胞核的形態，核素的减少，染色的黯淡。異常的核分解方法，癌腫全部的結構，往往呈着極力模仿原發地的組織模樣，生理學方面，他也靠養氣的營養，此外另有一種由華爾氏Warburg發見的發酵能力。他能够把葡萄糖分解爲乳酸。這種作用稱之爲葡萄糖分解。Glucolysis癌細胞的生長能力，非常强烈，立體平面，同時發展不過發動的迅速與否，跟着人體健康成反比例。這是説，假定身體强壯的人生了癌腫，這個癌腫的惡性發動，必然遲緩，反之則加速地進行。癌細胞有時也能自行退化，而歸於消滅。所以癌病患者，有時也有既發之後，自行痊愈的可能。癌的種類很多，不必備述，簡單的約分爲腺癌，及上皮癌，二大類。癌腫的解剖生理及生活情形，略道其梗概後，自然我們需要知道他的成因，即所謂病原了。這是説，身體上皮細胞系的組織或器官，因何原故，而變成癌腫。這是一樁極難明白答覆的問題，假使有人能够的話，而他的答案確實可以公認。那麽，這個人立刻就是舉世矚目的學者與富翁。因爲爲了這重公案，正不知有多少公私的機關和個人，懸了重賞，以求解决這個問題。我們的國民政府，也曾爲了孫中山氏的肝癌，而備了賞金，昭告國人，緝捕兇犯。可是他鴻飛冥冥，不知躱在何處，也没有一些綫索呢。關於這個問題，現有的理論，像我下面所學舌的，約有三端。一爲</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>細菌學説，一爲寄生性生物學説，一爲刺激學説。當然的事實，是癌腫的形成，不是片面的動機，他必備有二個條件，然後一觸而發。一個是静因，就是我們所謂的素質。Disposition一個是動因，就是現在我所伸説的種種。</p>
<p>在細菌學全盛的時代，甚麽病都歸罪於細菌。癌腫自亦不能例外。很多人想尋得一種細菌來算做癌腫的病原體。可是結果都是失望。實在找不出一種特别的菌，像其他傳染病一樣，具有種種病原體必備的條件，如培養接種人工致病等等。在這項工作中，不知白耗掉了多少心血，却找不出一種癌腫的特有物，大都獲得的是癌腫潰瘍內的附庸物，即所謂續發性傳染，Sekundart　Jnfektion的産物。這樣情形之下，也曾有人主張，這種細菌，是屬於濾過性的一類。英國醫生Gye:Banard在Lancet雜誌上，曾經發表過文章説癌是一種傳染病，肇因於某種濾過性的細菌，或審愼些説，病毒Virus。他曾用紫外光拍過照像，但是没有被世人所公認，因爲癌的種類很多，他所用來做試騐而爲此項理論有力的根據的。</p>
<h3>定縣農村婦女訓練班概况</h3>
<p>— 玉衡</p>
<p>中華平民教育促進會衛生部，爲推進衛生至農村家庭，使農民家庭生活衛生化起見，特開辦農村婦女訓練班，訓練之課程以衛生爲中心，並加授圖藝畜牧，家庭工業等學科，以便將來回各村作輔助農村建設之初歩婦女工作。</p>
<p>該班招生之方法，係採用選擇法，規定每村爲二名至四名，凡係有保健員之村及示範村有優先權，年齡以二十歳至二十五歳者爲限，但已婚者有優先被選之機會，因平教會在定縣之工作，頗得人民之贊許，故報名者甚衆，因名額所限，僅取四十名，均已於三日入班受訓，各項費用均由平教會供給。</p>
<p>該班學生，均係來自農村，程度高低不齊，有的爲平民學校畢業，有的爲高級平民學校畢業，尚有曾在初中二年級肄業者，間起初管理方面尚覺有相當之困難，現在已完全訓練良好矣，學生均能努力探討，對於衛生頗感重要，且發生濃厚之興趣：各項課程之按排，頗合衛生之原則，課程之內容，均合乎學生之需要，每日所授之課程，爲常識，歷史，法律，衛生，園藝，畜牧，家庭工業，娱樂等，每日晚間並以導生傳習法教授識字，及報告時事，該班課程須多，但生活上完全以衛生爲原則，各項衛生習慣亦於此最短期間養成，現共分爲四組，每日一調。</p>
<p>調護組—矯治缺點，護理</p>
<p>淸潔組—洒梯及環境淸潔</p>
<p>手工組—棉綫製作</p>
<p>烹飪組—膳食</p>
<p>各組均有教員，與學生共同生活，精神飽滿，秩序井然，工作有條不紊，短短之六星期之訓練，將來之農村定可獲利不少也，特記其詳，以告國人，希我衛生界羣起爲之。</p>
<h3>神經作用之化學關係</h3>
<p>— 聲濤</p>
<p>瑞京典城卡羅林學院教授委員會判定本年度（一九三六）生理學及醫學羅伯奬金應得者爲英國倫敦之達利氏（Sir　Henry　Hallett-Dale）及奥國格瓦斯城之諾威氏（Otto　Logi）。二氏共同研究之成就爲神經作用之化學關係。</p>
<p>吾人心臟之跳動時快時慢，係受二神經之支配。其一，即吾人已周知之交感神經，可稱之爲心鞭而造成「吁」聲，此即促使心臟跳動急速之原動力。但心臟跳動時又發出一種相反之「郝特」聲，係受迷走神經之支配。由此二神經而造成心臟跳動中快躍與憂悶，歡呼與抑鬱之過程。交感神經與迷走神經實爲此過程之主宰。</p>
<p>此二神經究有何種神力使心臟發出「吁」與「郝特」二聲？電力，神迷生命進程中一種放射力，抑或爲化學關係？曩昔生理學家及醫師等皆認之爲莫解謎！</p>
<p>諾威教授等之發明謂上述兩神經之作用，係由於該神經等能分泌一種化學物質直達心臟。諾威教授等此種結論乃根據其在試騐室中精細研究而得。諾威教授之試騐，係解剖蛙使其心臟露出，刺激該蛙之迷走神經。則該蛙之心臟跳動漸趨緩慢。然後，諾威氏再將該蛙心臟因迷走神經受刺激後所排液質，導至另一蛙之心臟，則後一蛙之心臟跳動亦立即變慢。諾威教授等榮得羅伯奬金之功績僅在此。但，僅此似不重要之科學觀察却有極重大之意義。蛙之迷走神經受刺激後，其心臟所排出液質必含有某種物質，其作用與迷走神經本身相等。於是神經作用之謎已大白。液質內所含某種物質即神經內秘素是也。於是神經化學，腦髓化學，思想化學及感覺化學因而成立。</p>
<p>該項試騐之成功實在數年以前。維也納新聞報記者訪問諾威教授時，教授聲稱：</p>
<p>余服務於格瓦斯大學已二十六年。該項研究及其試騐之完成實遠在數年以前。直言之，余實未想像到該項工作竟得瑞典京城卡羅林學院教授委員會之垂青，而賜奬勵。勿論如何，余慶幸之餘，必因此再接再厲續繼研究。教授現已年及六十有二矣！</p>
<p>該項試騐成功後，繼續研究神經內泌素者遍及世界各科學研究機關。最近且竟能準確計算神經刺激物質之化學成分：約爲千分之○·○○○○六公分。</p>
<p>科學之研究無止境。今諾威教授等之成就僅首開研究神經內泌學之端。對於該項學問之澈底瞭解尚待後起科學家之繼續努力耳！</p>
<h3>眼耳鼻喉疾病衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（一一五）歐氏管</p>
<p>歐氏管，又名耳喇叭。或稱耳管。是一個喇叭形的管狀物。一端開口於中耳的鼓室前壁。稱曰鼓室開口。一端開口於咽頭。稱曰咽頭開口。歐氏管的全身。約爲三　五生的米突。近鼓室端三分之一處（長約一如以的米突）。乃由骨管所成。其餘的部分（長約二·五生的米突）。則由軟骨及膜樣組織而成。軟骨膜樣部與骨部的境界部。最爲狹隘。稱曰歐氏管狹窄部。歐氏管的外壁。附着軟口蓋張筋。這條筋肉收縮的時候。歐氏管的管腔。即可開張。外界的空氣。亦即經此而入鼓室。又在軟骨的底及內壁。附着軟口蓋舉筋。這條筋肉收縮的時候。亦可輔助歐氏管的開張。軟骨部歐氏管自狹窄部以下。漸次廣闊而呈喇叭形。所以歐氏管特有耳喇叭的一名。歐氏管一旦發生狹窄及閉塞。則能感覺難聽及耳鳴等症。</p>
<p>（一一六）歐氏管狹窄及閉塞</p>
<p>歐氏管狹窄及閉塞。多發生於（一）鼻炎（多患鼻閉塞。以致鼻咽腔的換氣不充分。氣壓减退。繼發鼻咽腔，歐氏管粘膜的充血），（二）副鼻腔蓄膿症（由流注於鼻咽腔膿汁的刺㦸。以致鼻咽腔粘膜多陷於炎症狀態。歐氏管腔因此亦即狹窄），（三）咽頭炎，（四）腺樣增殖症，（五）口蓋扁桃腺炎及（六）口蓋扁桃腺肥大症等病。</p>
<p>本症主要的症候。就是患者感覺難聽，耳鳴部充塞，及頭部眩暈等等。此外本症尚有一特異點。即患者在嚥下，欠伸，及噴嚏等後。聽覺恒能一時佳良。若用耳鏡施行檢查。是爲本症的特徵。有時且能察知鼓室內瀦溜液體的水平綫。此可隨患者頭位的前後俯仰而移動（保持水平面的關係）。</p>
<p>本症約治療方法。當以原因療法最爲重要。譬如患有鼻炎，副鼻腔蓄膿症，咽頭炎，或口蓋扁桃腺炎者。應即儘先醫治。至若患有腺樣增殖症，或口蓋扁桃腺肥大症者。尤宜及早施行切除。同時兼用歐氏管通氣法。屢有顯著的效果。</p>
<h3>蛀齒與生命之關係</h3>
<p>— 任君明</p>
<p>吾人自乳齒交換成人齒後。應有齒牙共三十二枚。爲數既多。運用無間。因而崩潰腐蝕之機會漸生。蓋口腔爲飲食輸進之唯一孔道。細菌從食物入口。棲留於齒縫牙頸間。常有多至二十餘種。至其他之食糜肉屑。遺留於齒牙僻處。拭擦不淸。遂得與細菌混合。而進行其腐化工作。其始也。經過發酵作用。釀成一種液體。名曰乳酸。齒牙之外層玻質。經乳酸之日久浸潤。遂生崩潰。細菌由已崩潰之小穴。進行齲蝕。逐漸擴展。不數月間。竟穿過玻質。而達象牙質。因象牙質之硬度。反遜於玻質。故其腐蛀之程度。亦更迅速。不潔之物。壅塞穴內。日積月多。而穴內之温度。亦較穴外爲高。細菌之增殖。因而愈繁。齲蝕之進行愈烈。而崩壞之窩洞。更愈擴大。象牙質中。感受細菌及乳酸攻伐之一部份齒細管。漸次溶解分裂。而齒細管中之纖微腦經。遂因刺激。而發生酸軟痛楚。繼且壞死。然此亦不過一部份之齲蝕疼痛病狀。當酸軟發作之始。齒中之髓。仍屬生存。苟於此時。施以適當療治。排法腐質。殺滅細菌。安撫生髓。然後以適當之充塡料補復之。自與健全之齒牙無異。</p>
<p>如不照上述辦法。及早塡補。則細菌之進展更深。穿破象牙質。直透髓腔。髓腔位於齒牙正中。齒髓存焉。此時齒髓暴露。絶無保障。舉凡寒熱氣體。及一切軟硬物質。偶一觸及。則痛楚萬分。即不觸及。而齒髓既已透露。受細菌感染。亦必發炎疼痛。此時如就牙醫處。用藥殺髓。消炎。除穢。辟毒。抽髓净盡。充塡根管。補固齒冠。不特此後免除痛楚疾患。即其咀嚼功用。亦與健全齒牙絶無差異。</p>
<p>倘至上述時期。猶復昧於治理。一任其齲蝕進行。齒髓不堪細菌之感染肆毒。遂呈高度炎性。充血至死。其遺屍殘存髓腔之內。與其他之腐敗物質混和。繼而腐臭化膿。沿根管前進。成爲齒髓壞疽。同時齒根膜亦受傳染。因之充血作痛。病齒浮動。常有影響至牙肉發炎。散放至於面頰。肌肉及神經同時受刺激壓廹。至於疼痛浮腫。有時僥倖。因人們體內血白䏭之抵抗力强。能尅制病程之進行。漸趨平復。然此不過暫時的現象而已。蓋標病雖覺輕快。而本病之進行。正未有艾。此時根端根膜之病患。或變慢性膿炎。如釀成根端膿瘡。根膜化膿。齒槽膿漏等症。此種慢性牙疾。美國牙醫美耀氏謂。能禍及全身。發生一百五十餘種重症。對於生命有直接危險。其最著者。如盲腸炎。胃潰瘍。心內外衣炎。腎病。肺病。神經病。眼炎。關節炎等。常用慢性牙患傳染所致。</p>
<p>其不幸而轉急性巨患者。如　骨骨膜炎。骨髓炎。及齒槽膿瘍等。以至膿毒入血。不治而死。</p>
<p>世人每視齒牙爛痛。爲輕微疾患。忽略不求醫治。以爲於健康上。生命上。無關重要。實則大謬不然。迨至急慢性之疾患日深。抵抗之機能漸弱。生命遂淪於險境。可憐亦可哀矣。</p>
<p>上文所述。不過就通俗宣傳立論。至其他詳細的著述。當於下期再述之。</p>

<h3>擴大冀東偽組織</h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>昨據津訊，某方為策動冀東偽組織，擴大防共政府，現由在津某特務機關，積極推進，以漢奸程國瑞，楊榮齋，趙文俊，等為領袖，其計劃為破壞交通，藉口共匪所為，這種計劃，雖極惡辣，但他們惡辣手段，行使已久，似乎倒覺平常，不足為異，惟冀當局細心應付而已。</p>
<p>某方本來要求五省自治，因為我方拒絕，目的不達，於是大減其價，一變而為冀察自治之要求，但是索價太奢，我方無法應允，不得已惟有想出種種破壞政策，酷辣行為，以冀達到其固定之目的，現在此種陰謀，已被我方發覺，自應設法嚴防，武力制止，决難再為隱忍。</p>
<p>卽如察哈爾方面，何以不知不覺地竟為外人勢力完全佔去，以致綏遠方面，頻頻告驚，去年百靈廟一段，不知費了幾許頭顱，經過幾次肉搏，方能奪回，而綏東極重要的商都，尚在匪偽之手，眞是容易而失之，艱難而得之，莫謂股肱之患，尚未及於心腹也。</p>
<p>今冀東方面，又有某方積極擴大的偽組織，冀省何地？偽組織何名？倘再隱忍不發，一任其自由行動，則心腹之患已成，無論他們尚欲擴大，尚欲推進，卽使並不擴大推進，而現在非驢非馬的組織，已使人觸目而驚心，此種地方，若不未雨綢繆，痛加矯正，今後將不堪設想也。</p>
<p>前日某方駐鄭特務機關，被我抄獲後，搜出秘密文件多種，㊀策劃河南省黃河以北各縣獨立，㊁勾結土匪民團暴動，㊂編印反動口號，煸惑民衆，㊃實行間牒工作，㊄組織特殊無綫電班，此種酷辣秘密行為，業已隨處發見，此種密謀，若不嚴加懲處，勢必到處搗亂，到處有同樣的組織，語曰履露堅冰至，又曰涓涓不塞，將成江河，此種酷辣的行為，非用酷辣的手段，無從對付也。</p>
<h3>五福臨門</h3>
<p>— 大喜</p>
<p>坎拿大安達利奧州“一胎五女”的奇聞，曾經轟動過全世界，這五個小把戲，在前年正月，便已學得走路，到了去年，做得跳舞及游戲的姿態，這眞算是難能可貴！</p>
<p>這五個幸福的兒童，她們時常有專門的醫生在旁邊照料，使她們的起居完全衛生化；並且注意她們食物中鈣質及維他命D的含量。因為鈣質和維他命D，都是齒牙骨骼的重要原料，正在發育的兒童需要尤殷。所以有些兒童骨質不良和蛀牙，都是因為鈣質缺乏！</p>
<p>“家樂鈣”巧克力糖，是我國五洲藥房的新出品，口味和一般巧克力糖無異，但含有豐富的鈣質和維他命D，兒童常食能使骨質發育優良，造成終身的康健基礎呢。</p>
<h3>妻</h3>
<p>— 王慕新</p>
<p>最近以來，妻的精神很快樂，她的面容也紅潤起來了。</p>
<p>記得以前的那些時候，妻時常帶着憂鬱的臉色，身體衰弱，神經過敏，往往因為一點細微的事情，就和我爭執起來，雖然事情過後她也後悔，流淚，但是隔了不久的時候她又要和我吵鬧！</p>
<p>我看見妻的這種情形，我暗想她身體必定有病態吧，經我仔細詢問，果然妻是患着“月經困難”的病，於是我明瞭她的鬱悶煩燥，都是因為患着這種病的關係。</p>
<p>現在她服“月月紅”已經有兩個月了，她的病態全消，身體日健，我除過歡喜以外，還要感謝五洲藥房之賜。</p>
<h3>觀黃伯長的摔角後</h3>
<p>— 因非</p>
<p>職業摔角家黃伯長先生在上海的第一次比賽，我是去看了的，表演得很精彩，使人在感到殘忍之外，不由你不緊捏一把手汗，那天的情形，是並不怎樣熱鬧，尤其是中國的觀衆，祇佔到一成左右。想來是因為中國在這方面的表演總是時常失敗的緣故。</p>
<p>以後情形可不同了，聽看了回來的朋友說，中國人看的很多，在報上呢，也看到過一位夫人在比賽之前賜袍的新聞。想來那是因為黃伯長先生勝了的緣故，在感到了“興有榮矣”之餘，特地去“揚眉吐氣”一番的。以後因為是“長勝”，“揚眉吐氣”去的自然就更多。自然，也有老主顧們是因為關心而去的。也有因為聽人說是刺激緊張，於是也去觀一下光，但自然也不無愛國心理在作祟，如果黃伯長第一次就失敗，卽使再刺激緊張些，我想也不見得會有這麽許多同胞去觀光的。</p>
<p>在最近，則有好幾張報紙說是這比賽是假的了，並且也有由之而申論到“職業”和“業餘”問題上去的。是否是假？我這個外行人看不出，也不是我這篇短文想說的，至於“職業”和“業餘”問題呢，我對體育留心得太少，并且素無研究，自然更不能談。我想談的，是其他的一些瑣碎的感想。</p>
<p>記得世界運動會中國選手全軍覆沒的消息傳來之後，是曾經“輿論譁然”過的。這裏的所謂“輿論”，並不是專指報章雜誌而言，舉凡朋友們在茶餘酒後的談天，也包括在內。“譁然”的理由大槪可分為二種，第一種是說，化了鉅費的金錢不算，還連帶坍盡了中國的台。後一說則恰得其反，說，坍台還在其次，因為這是意料中的，最可惜的是浪費了許多金錢，如果把這筆經費在國內好好的建設一種事業，那是實際而又有益得多多的。“譁然”固有兩種，但原因却祇一個：因為全軍覆沒而返。如果多少得一點分數，我想是不至“羣情激昂”至如此程度的。</p>
<p>這一次黃伯長先生在上海的表演，情形可恰和世運會相反，他是“長勝將軍”。惟其為“長勝將軍”，於是“興有榮矣”的中國觀衆便逐漸地增加了。</p>
<p>也有人說觀衆的愛好看摔角，是因為野蠻的遺傳”關係，有－張報紙譯的美國職業摔角家傑克遜的自白，其中便有說，“這許多文明的觀衆原也有野蠻的遺傳。比賽愈凶狠，愈是帶着流血性的恐怖，觀衆們也愈被吸引着。那般稱為愛好溫柔的女性却比男士們更為着迷。”</p>
<p>這說法也許是有它的理由的，但却不是挺好的理由，譬如我罷，當我看這幕殘忍的游戲的時候，是也的確覺得愈狠愈好的，但這有個限度，那就是凶狠必須是屬於自己所同情者的，所以當黃怕長被對方揪住的時候，這“凶狠”便引起我殘忍的感覺來了。就是平常看球賽，這感覺也是有的，我們所同情的隊伍敗了時，總有些不快；這同情的由來，差不多可說是先天的，卽使要强迫，也决計改變不過來，卽要强迫呢，惡感也就愈深。而奇怪得很的，同情者好像也結了伴，在球塲裏，沒有人“命令”或“津貼”，同情某隊者却時常會自然而然的佔着多數的，而餘下的反對者，却大都是因為與對方有什麽利害關係。</p>

<p>起來者，是因爲他“長勝”，而覺得“爲國爭光”的緣故。這教訓非常值得我們賓貴，而例子也很多，例如綏遠的抗敵，便是其一。</p>
<p>請珍視這「同情」，並且，請好好地使用這「同情」。末了。我想向一切的人們警告。</p>
<h3>海外的人</h3>
<p>— 金戈</p>
<p>老光沒頭沒腦的在街上亂闖，想遇到個把新丁（註一），或者鄕里（註二），打一下秋風，也好把肚子暫時塞一下。</p>
<p>老光昨天才從監裏放出來。住在牢裏的時候，吃飯可不用自己操心。放了出來，頓時連飯也沒有吃了。昨天幸而遇見了一個新丁，騙了頓夜飯，今天可難過了。</p>
<p>“到職業介紹所去撞撞木鐘看吧”。不知他怎麽突然會想起這個處所。他的心，似乎有些希望了。職業介紹所的門口，擠了好多的人。黑越越的－堆，有些透不過氣來的樣子。門口的那塊招牌，被擠得斜了上去，白色的字面上，蒙上了厚厚的一陣油光。</p>
<p>“丟那媽，擠得要命！”老光用祖國的土話，罵了一聲。</p>
<p>他用力的向裏擠，但仍被擠退了出來。</p>
<p>“媽的，老子可不高興擠了。擠上了，還不是沒飯吃！”</p>
<p>他回過身來，正想開步走的當兒，冷不防看見了多年不見的老鄕里老華。他趕忙去抓住了他的手腕，很親熱的樣子。其實，誰都是窮光蛋，誰還擺起什麽臭架子！</p>
<p>“老華，多年不見了，發財吧？”</p>
<p>“你發財！”怪老光說他發財，侮辱了他。</p>
<p>“咱發財會到這裏來？近來，你幹些什麽？好過去？”</p>
<p>“好過去也不上這兒啦！”兩個子慘然的笑了起來。</p>
<p>“什麽！你還想擠上去？……”</p>
<p>老華爭脫了老光的手，用力的擠過去，却給老光一把拉了回來。</p>
<p>“凑凑機會啦！”</p>
<p>“別想你痴！你看！這麽許多人，擠得上？卽使給你擠上了，還有那些花旗鬼呢（註三），會給你登記？登記了，你就有飯吃？</p>
<p>“哈！花旗鬼也沒有飯吃了，還說唐人呢（註四）！嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>“咱們走吧，還是‘六星期’吧！”</p>
<p>老光拉着老華，不容他不答應，生的把老華拖走了。</p>
<p>“好吧！反正沒飯吃！”</p>
<p>老華的心一橫，也就跟着老光走了。</p>
<p>冬風不住的往他們身上撲來，身子兀自抖個不住一肚子裏咕碌碌的呌個不停。走到火車站，等警察不在的時候，他們混進了月台，又好容易的混進了車廂，於是兩個子，有些泰然了。</p>
<p>一例慢長的車子，開了。黃黃的田野，飛快的在向後退。漠野裏的夜冬風更大的括着，但括不到他們的身上來。</p>
<p>一站，二站，已給他們鬼混過了三站。</p>
<p>“老光：不好了，查票來了！”老華很恐慌的樣子。</p>
<p>“怕什麽？還不是下車！”老光倒很泰然。</p>
<p>於是，在第四站，就被趕下了車。</p>
<p>“老華！這裏沒有來過呢！”</p>
<p>“好！就在這裏吧！”</p>
<p>兩個子，像幽靈似的向熱鬧的街上闖去，商店裏，全都掛上了年紅燈，紅的，還是綠的，怪耀眼！</p>
<p>“喂！前面有警察呢……好動手了。”</p>
<p>警笛響了。街上頓時起了個小騷擾。兩個警察，提着他倆的領子送進新客衙去。</p>
<p>“老光，吃六星期太平飯囉！”</p>
<p>註一：“新丁”，廣東人呌新來的人為“新丁”，含有侮辱意</p>
<p>註二：“鄕里”，廣東人稱同鄕呌“鄕里”。</p>
<p>註三：“花旗鬼”，華僑稱美國為花旗，稱美國人為“花旗鬼”，有時也呌“花旗人”</p>
<p>註四：“唐人”，在美華僑常自稱“唐人”。</p>

<h3>上海貧民庇寒所訪問記（上）</h3>
<p>— 李彩華</p>
<p>為了要知道些貧民庇寒所的情形和貧民在庇塞所裏的生活，特於前天到南火車站潮惠五邑山莊去訪問了－次。</p>
<p>進門就看見許多蘆蓆棚，棚上貼着“禁止吸煙”的標語。我向站在門口掛着白布符號的人聲述了來意，就領我們到總務室坐下，總務室管理員江君隨卽介紹總班長陳君招待參觀，巡禮之後，就提出以下的問答：</p>
<p>“貴所關辦幾年了？”</p>
<p>“今年第八屆了。”</p>
<p>“貧民入所和出所有無事續？”</p>
<p>“手續很簡單，入所第一檢查有無引火物（如自來火），第二登記，問明年齡籍貫，第二分發衣服被頭，第四剃頭，第五編班正式過庇寒生活了。至於出所我們有四種辦法：年壯力强而無職業者送游民習藝所；年老者送安老院；有家屬者讓家屬領去；歸家無川資者遣資送回。”</p>
<p>“貴所貧民來源如何？現有多少人？”</p>
<p>“貧民來源分三種：一是自己投來，二是社會局送來，三是公安局送來，其中以自己投來最多。現有貧民的一千四百人，成人約－千人，兒童約四百人，年齡最大者有七十多的老翁，最小的有六歲的孩兒。其中以二十至四十歲的最多。”</p>
<p>“貴所收容貧民有無限制？”</p>
<p>“來者不拒。”</p>
<p>“但人數擠不下的時候怎辦？同時經費不也超出預算了嗎？”</p>
<p>“人數太擠了，我們可以安插到第二所，第二所擠不下可籌設第三第四……好在沒有房租。至於經費，原是我們在苦思焦急之中，大部分經費完全靠慈善家的幫助和政府的津貼，現在當然還是在不斷地向外界募捐。我們每天平均供給一個貧民要兩毛錢，（包括飯食開水藥品等）如以－千四百人計，則每日要化二百八十元左右，每期要化三四萬元”。</p>
<p>“貴所每年何時開始收容？何時結束？”</p>
<p>“每年冬至前十數日開始，至來年清明後十數日結束。”</p>

<p>開篇「花名」</p>
<p>金爐且把檀香焚。素馨一片禱神明。奴本是，芍藥嬌軀閨閣秀。紫荆停阻少精神。多時不想山茶飲。無奈聊將罌粟吞。剪春羅帳長思睡。荼糜香夢帶昏沉。梳妝懈把芙蓉粉。金雀無心揀鬢雲。錦葵披體猶嫌冷。柳腰常繫石榴裙。到晚來，滿腹雪蕉眠未穩。杜鵑枝上月三更。竟做了，姣嫩海棠無力倦。要拜求，那坐蓮花觀世音。保奴家，病恙脱除添百合。四時月季退災星。欵冬度過交新歳。告禀萱花慈母聞。花是金銀心願了。佛見笑神前達志誠。不學那，桃花輕薄隨流水。要修行學道樂長春。十姊妹雖已完花燭。我是素蘭不願染紅塵。要曉得。開盡牡丹誇富貴。幾番蝴蝶夢非真。説甚麽紫薇郎貌多温雅。説甚麽荷花凡緻妙娉婷。憑你玉蘭金鳳客。都是蘆花會裏人。珠藤牽掛也虚名。</p>
<p>蔣賓初「三笑」</p>
<p>新聲（一三八○）下午七時至八時</p>
<p>開篇「柳毅」</p>
<p>桃花如繡柳如金。張序相邀柳毅行。兩兩有才皆有貌。雙雙同學又同鄉。踏青結伴尋詩句。信歩翩翩近海濱。見一個。牧羊女子含愁色。背人羞澀見人驚。衣裝不類尋常女。一種風流妙入神。無聊爲問嬌娘子。家世何妨試一云。嬌姿豈像牧羊人。含羞檢袵低低説。細語渾如出谷鶯。阿儂因爲家君怒。今日懇求寄一音。頭上犀堪作證。江邊大樹可爲門。如其引指如其説。果有江邊大樹陰。信手輕輕叩幾聲。那曉此乃是犀牛角。頃刻能將海水分。水晶宫殿琉璃座。參見晚冠座上人。皇者嚇然生震怒。既然如此豈容情。論姻緣不碍冥幽隔。鼉鼓逢逢和樂音。龍宫入贅洞庭前。</p>

<h3>Yang Hucheng Leaves Xi'an to Reside in Lintong, Establishes New Organization</h3>
<p>Conflict Erupts Between Feng Qinzai's Troops and the Northeast Army; Northeast Generals Establish General Staff in Xi'an; Xi'an Rushes to Build Defenses; Tongpu Transportation is Blocked; Liu Zhi Sends Telegrams to Yu Xuezhong and Others Urging Them to Consider the Difficult Times</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] According to reliable sources, a conflict erupted between Yang Hucheng and the Northeast Army generals. Yang left Xi'an on the 6th and moved to Lintong to establish a new organization. The Northeast Army, lacking a leader, established a general staff in Xi'an, with He Zhuguo as the chief and Wang Yizhe as the deputy chief. Other senior military officers are also members. After Zhang Xueliang went to Nanjing, Yang wanted to be the leader and issued orders, but Zhang's troops refused to obey, leading to conflict. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Feng Qinzai's army has concentrated in Gushi and is advancing westward. On the 10th, they engaged in fierce fighting with the rebel army in Guanshan Xinshi. The troops in Fuping are advancing eastward to reinforce them. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] The suburbs of Xi'an are rushing to build defenses, and the city wall fortifications are also being repaired. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Feng Qinzai's troops are confronting and clashing with the newly formed 32nd Division in Hexi. The Public Security 3rd Brigade, led by Sun Canglang, is rushing to build fortifications in Pucheng. Yang's family members in Pucheng are moving to the countryside. Transportation between Tongzhou and Pucheng is blocked. Long-distance buses between Tongguan and Xi'an also stopped running on the 9th, but mail can still pass through. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Sources concerned received a telegram from Luoyang stating that Yang Hucheng, Yu Xuezhong, and others, as well as the old Northeast Army, are indeed showing a tendency to cooperate with the Communists. Yang's troops and the Northeast Army, originally stationed in northern Shaanxi, have been moving south, and some have reached the Sanyuan and Gaoling areas, five miles from Xi'an. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After receiving the central government's orders for handling the situation, Yu Xuezhong, the chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, recently sent a telegram to He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Affairs, stating that he was grateful for not being severely condemned and for being treated with leniency. He was deeply moved by the central government's benevolence and the Minister's care. He also stated that he was willing to persuade the Northeast Army to obey the central government. It is reported that Minister He immediately sent a reply telegram expressing his appreciation and asking him to lead by example and earnestly implement the central government's orders, and to do his best to persuade the Northeast Army generals to avoid hesitation and self-deception, which would harm the country. (Eleventh Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] Liu Zhi, the Director of the Henan-Anhui Pacification Headquarters, recently sent separate telegrams to Yu Xuezhong and Wang Yizhe, sincerely urging them to consider the difficult times, follow the central government's designated locations for relocation, reassure the people, and stabilize the western frontier. The two telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To Yu Xuezhong: "Recently, I read the central government's telegrams, which are reasonable and considerate, showing generosity to Han Xiang's past and planning for your future. The considerations are extremely appropriate and thorough. Even if you were in their position, you could not have done better. Men should regard fame and fortune as fleeting clouds, and pledge loyalty to the bright sun. If you see good, follow it; if you know your mistakes, correct them. You should not harbor any protectionism or deviate from your original intentions. I hope you will consider the difficult times, deeply consider the foundation of the country, reassure the people, and stabilize the western frontier, carefully preserving Han Xiang's good reputation and saving the people's vitality. Please do not cling to small-mindedness and focus only on the moment. The Northeast troops have been struggling on difficult roads for years, often with their families, suffering from hunger and poverty. Thinking of them is heartbreaking. My brother's patriotism and loyalty to the party have always been enthusiastic. I hope you will consider my frank words."</p>
<p>(2) To Wang Yizhe: "Currently, the international situation is so serious that only national unity and sincere solidarity can save the country and ensure its survival. The central government has made extremely fair arrangements based on reason and compassion. I hope you will embrace your patriotic heart and take the lead in following the designated locations for relocation, reassuring the people, stabilizing the western frontier, dispelling darkness and bringing harmony, and establishing lasting merit and fame. This is not a task for others. The clouds of Qin are in sight. I sincerely hope for your good intentions." (Eleventh Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to someone who came to Nanjing from Xi'an, the wife of President Yu of the Control Yuan returned to Shaanxi due to her mother's illness. During the Xi'an Incident, Sun Weiru's army headquarters was stationed in Sanyuan. Mrs. Yu obtained a car from Sun and went to Xi'an to confront Yang Hucheng, scolding him for his injustice and strongly criticizing his actions. Yang Hucheng was very alarmed. After Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing, the situation in Xi'an remained chaotic. Mrs. Yu went to Xi'an again to confront Yang Hucheng. Currently, Sun Weiru's troops are still stationed in the Sanyuan area, and many residents of Sanyuan have fled back to their hometowns to avoid the disaster. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Zhang Fang, the Commander-in-Chief of the 24th Route Army, although from Henan, grew up in Shaanxi and previously served as the deputy commander of President Yu's National Pacification Army. Many of the Shaanxi military officers were his former subordinates. Recently, because Yang Hucheng has not yet followed the central government's orders, he sent a special telegram to Yang, earnestly advising him to quickly repent. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] The Xi'an section of the Longhai Railway is temporarily managed by Zhang Hongyan, the chief of the railway bureau. Contact with the eastern section of Tongguan has been lost. However, traffic has resumed on the Chishui to Baoji section. The Tongguan-Xi'an Engineering Bureau stopped construction westward after the Shaanxi Incident, and all employees returned to Zhengzhou to await orders. Passengers are crowded between Bian, Zheng, Luo, and Tongguan, and the railway is adding extra trains. However, freight transportation is not smooth, and commodity prices in Bian, Zheng, Luo, and Shaanxi are soaring. (Eleventh Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Since being pardoned, Zhang Xueliang has been enjoying himself by reading books and rarely seeing guests. Because Yu and Yang have not yet accepted the central government's orders, he is deeply concerned. He sent a special telegram to Gansu, urging Yu Xuezhong to order his troops to obey the central government's arrangements. It is also learned that President Yu Youren of the Control Yuan sent another long telegram from Shanghai to Yang Hucheng on the 10th, urging him to come to his senses. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The post-incident measures for Shaanxi and Gansu, which were promulgated many days ago, have not yet been implemented, and the situation there is quite tense. According to Zhao Bulian, the director of the Taiyuan Pacification Commissioner's Office, the central government has announced measures for handling the aftermath of the Xi'an Incident. At a time when foreign aggression is imminent and Suiyuan is under pressure, Commissioner Yan hopes that Yu Xuezhong and Yang Hucheng will accept the central government's measures, obey orders, maintain local peace and security, and prevent the Communists from succeeding. Otherwise, the people of Shaanxi and Gansu will be in dire straits and unable to extricate themselves. As for the Suiyuan Incident, the fighting has subsided due to the cold weather, but the intention of a certain party to invade Suiyuan has not diminished. Amidst the tension in Suiyuan, the Communists in Shaanxi are also causing trouble. Commissioner Yan has ordered strict precautions. He added that he will go to Shanghai tomorrow to greet Chairman Wang on behalf of Yan. It is still uncertain whether Yan will be able to find time to come to Nanjing for the Third Plenary Session. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Workers' Welfare Association sent a telegram to Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong, saying, "You were the initiators of the Xi'an Incident. The central government and Chairman Chiang are benevolent and generous, and have not imposed severe punishment. How should you express your gratitude and repentance, atone for your sins, obey orders, and defend the border? All of our compatriots will not discriminate against you and the generals and soldiers of Shaanxi and Gansu because of this incident. We hope you will be courageous in repentance, pull back from the precipice, obey the central government, and strive to repay the country. You must know that revolutionary armed forces are the people's armed forces. Soldiers should not have feudal tribal ideas. Disobeying the central government's orders is violating the people's will and becoming the enemy of the entire nation. Please think carefully and choose wisely." At the same time, they wrote to the Central Executive Committee, asking them to impose strict sanctions on Yang and Yu if they remain unrepentant, in order to rectify discipline and eliminate the source of chaos. The city's workers pledge to be their backing. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Zhang Xueliang played golf at the Capital Golf Club today. Several foreigners met Zhang at the club today, which dispels the rumors that Zhang has left Nanjing. (Eleventh Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Passes Through Manila</h3>
<p>Attends Banquet Hosted by Philippine President Quezon; Issues Statement to Journalists</p>
<p>[Manila] Former President of the Executive Yuan of China, Mr. Wang Jingwei, passed through Manila yesterday on the ship "Bozi" on his way back from Germany with his wife. At noon, he attended a banquet at the Presidential Palace hosted by President Quezon. After the banquet, he told reporters that he would not be elected as president under the new constitution because China had many more capable leaders than him. Regarding the Xi'an Incident, Mr. Wang expressed optimism, saying that although the current situation is serious, it is only an unfortunate incident that occurred by chance and should not be difficult to resolve. Mr. Wang also said that China is now sincerely cooperating with Japan, but only if Japan shows the same attitude. When asked what kind of basis would be needed for Sino-Japanese cooperation to succeed, Wang replied: (1) To restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations by adopting ordinary methods and abandoning military intervention; (2) China's sovereignty must be respected; (3) Manchuria must be returned to China. It is reported that Mr. Wang will arrive in Shanghai on the 14th of this month. (Eleventh Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Wang Jingwei will arrive in Hong Kong on the morning of the 12th. Central representatives Shao Lizi, Zhou Fohai, Zhou Qigang, and Peng Xuepei arrived in Hong Kong on the 11th. Guangdong representatives Liu Weichi, Wang Yingyu, and Chiang Kai-shek's representative Luo Zhuoying, along with many others, have arrived in Hong Kong one after another. Li Baibo sent Kan Zonghua as a representative to greet him. Wang will not go to Guangzhou, but will board the ship north. Chen Bijun will go to Guangzhou to pay respects to Hu Hanmin.

<p>[Nanjing] The National Government held its memorial week at 9 AM on the 11th. Attendees included Deng Jiayan, Jing Hengyi, Cheng Qian, Chu Minyi, Chen Xunyong, Chen Qicai, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from the National Government and various ministries and commissions, totaling over 400 people. After leading the assembly in observing ceremonial rites, Chairman Lin gave an impromptu speech on "Psychological National Defense." He began by stating that the meaning of national defense could be interpreted in two ways: first, national defense in a broad sense, encompassing political, economic, and cultural aspects, referring to both spiritual and material national defense; second, national defense in a narrow sense, referring specifically to the country's military strength. National defense in a broad sense, in other words, is the collective power of the entire nation to resist aggression. The external aggression that modern nations experience can be divided into four types: political, economic, cultural, and military. Military aggression is felt immediately, while political, economic, and cultural aggression are gradual and not easily perceived at first. However, their harmful effects are more profound than military aggression. Therefore, in today's world, it is not enough to focus solely on military strength to resist aggression from all sides; it is essential to seek national defense in a broad sense to be effective. He further stated that "psychological national defense," as one aspect of the broader concept, refers to the psychological strength of the entire nation to resist aggression, which can be said to be the foundation of all national defense. Based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings on "psychological reconstruction," he elaborated on why psychological national defense is more important than material national defense. He reiterated that to unite the 400 million people of China and establish solid psychological national defense, we should start with the following three points: ❶ Recognize ourselves, and understand the perilous position in which our nation finds itself. ❷ Establish a common belief in the Three Principles of the People. ❸ Restore the nation's self-confidence and self-esteem. In recent years, the national mindset has been seeking peace and unity internally, and peace and independence externally. The internal mindset has fully demonstrated its strength, and the external mindset is gradually becoming more focused. He further expressed his hope that the entire nation, from top to bottom, would use this psychological national defense as a foundation and work together to establish total national defense. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Zhou Lu gave a report at the Central Memorial Week on the 11th, entitled "Review of the Past Year and Hopes for the Future." The original text stated: "Today's report is my personal perspective on 'Review of the Past Year and Hopes for the Future.' In the past year, there has been significant progress in the political arena, which we can observe in both foreign and domestic relations. First, regarding foreign relations, everyone knows that China cannot survive without active development. Since September 18th Incident, the government has been preparing in the military, financial, international, and other areas, but people inevitably had some doubts about the central government's determination to work hard. Over the past year, this has gradually gained widespread recognition in the country. Until the Suiyuan Incident, the entire nation increasingly trusted the government, resulting in the unification of the national will. On the other hand, it has enhanced our country's international standing. Comrades, you must understand that the unification of the people's will is the most fundamental condition for revival. It is truly a cause for great rejoicing that our Party achieved this in the past year. Regarding domestic relations, the Liangguang Incident occurred last summer, and the Xi'an Incident occurred in December. Although their nature differed, the final resolution was achieved through peaceful means, avoiding military action and preserving much of the nation's vitality. During the Xi'an Incident, Chiang Kai-shek initially adopted an unyielding attitude in the face of Zhang Xueliang's threats, but after Zhang Xueliang repented, he requested a special pardon for him. This dignified and magnanimous demeanor was not only emulated throughout the country, but also greatly praised by foreign newspapers. Furthermore, when the country faced such a major crisis, the entire nation was able to express its support for the central government in a unified and enthusiastic manner. This demonstrates that the people's concept of the country is much more advanced than before, and their understanding of national affairs is more profound than before. This progress of the people is a very gratifying thing. Comrades, the year 1936 has become a thing of the past. All previous unfortunate events should pass away with the past, never to be seen again. After the start of 1937, we must not allow the dissipation of national strength, and even less should we follow in the footsteps of Spain, turning China into an international battlefield and inviting irreversible catastrophe. We must unite everyone and further strengthen our Party to lead the entire nation in overcoming national difficulties. We must use the spirit of leading the National Revolution to lead the National Revolution. We believe that the people, who have already progressed, will fully accept the leadership of our Party, strengthen the government's power, resolve this serious national crisis, and complete the great mission of national revival. In the era of Zhenguan during the Tang Dynasty, when the country was largely settled, the emperor and his ministers still believed that founding the dynasty was difficult and maintaining it was not easy, and they strived to be diligent in consolidating the foundation of the country. Moreover, our country is not yet in a position to maintain what has been achieved, and even the founding has not been completed. In addition, the national crisis is becoming increasingly serious. Our Party bears this great responsibility and should always maintain a sense of crisis, concentrate the strength of the entire nation, and unify the will of the entire nation in order to complete the unfinished work of the revolution. This is what we earnestly hope for." (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>The Continuation of the Aid Suiyuan Movement</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war on the Suiyuan border, the economic assistance given by the entire country has shown a vigorous and surging momentum for a time. The consolation of wounded soldiers and the relief of people in disaster areas have been constantly planned and considered by people in the rear. A few days ago, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, together with the standing committee of the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Association, loaded with relief goods, traveled to Suiyuan to console the wounded soldiers and offer rewards. This not only benefited the sick and the poor but also inspired a sense of confidence among the troops. The significance of the journey is extraordinary. However, with limited resources and many people in need, the distribution is ultimately insufficient. In addition, it is reported that the people in the border areas are suffering greatly and experiencing pain in the winter, making relief even more urgent. The Charity Organizations United Association in this city has already, based on the statements in the telegrams from the two standing committee members, sent letters to all sectors of society for extensive fundraising. We also very much want to fulfill our responsibility to promote this, in order to convey the hidden feelings of appeal. With sympathy in our hearts, we dare to ask for a hearing.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Suiyuan War, the motivation for people across the country to contribute funds was primarily aimed at military strength. This was because the ferocious bandits were present and someone was behind them, providing them with supplies and weapons. Our border province was facing a difficult task, and it was difficult to cope with the situation unless military preparations were improved. Fortunately, we were able to recover important passes and frustrate the enemy, which was due to the inspiration of the masses, giving the soldiers the determination to fight to the death, as well as the abundant supplies, which eliminated the soldiers' worries about lack of supplies. Even today, the frontline war has temporarily stopped, but the conspiracy is still brewing. There is still no way to relax the military preparations. The burial of the remains of the war, the treatment of wounded soldiers, the compensation for fallen heroes, and the resettlement of displaced refugees all depend on the coordination of resources. We imagine the brave men groaning on their beds and the tragic state of their mutilated limbs, asking for whom they suffered and endured this pain. Our hearts are filled with sadness, and we cannot help but ask. Even those who survived the war, those families who were destroyed and displaced, are also our compatriots. How can we ignore them like the people of Qin and Yue? However, the urgent need for funds on one side is the focus, while the spirit of supporting the war on the other side has begun to decline. If this continues, the difficulties ahead are self-evident. Therefore, we must make strong and continuous efforts to continue the aid Suiyuan movement.</p>
<p>The significance of economic aid to Suiyuan, from a positive perspective, lies in increasing the strength of national defense preparations. From a negative perspective, it lies in reducing the pain in our hearts. Saving the nation and seeking survival is the responsibility of every citizen. The whole country should act together, without exception. Since we cannot wear armor and wield weapons to serve in the front lines, we can only contribute grain and grass to fulfill our responsibilities in the rear. Fortunately, as long as Suiyuan exists, we must do everything in our power. We must know that this action is equivalent to protecting our own heads, not like rescuing people in a well. Since its nature transcends the concept of charity, contributions should be made regardless of size or frequency. Only by everyone taking off their coats and donating generously, urging each other on, and using the spirit of "the more the better" to make continuous remittances, can we hope to achieve results, distribute them evenly, secure the border, boost morale, and benefit the disabled, the displaced, and the refugees. In this way, the anxieties long hidden in our hearts will also be slightly relieved.</p>
<h3>Three Thousand Japanese Volunteer Soldiers to Participate in the Spanish War</h3>
<p>Tokyo Authorities Hear the News Like a Bolt from the Blue; Regard it as Malicious Propaganda from Europe</p>
<p>Gibraltar: According to reliable sources, 3,000 Japanese volunteer soldiers will soon arrive in Spain and land at the ports of Cadiz and Jerez. They will be immediately transferred to the Madrid front to join the 10,000 Italian volunteer soldiers who recently landed at the port of Cadiz and have now been transferred to Seville to join the Spanish National Army forces. According to news from the port of Cadiz, many boxes of aircraft parts manufactured in Italian factories were unloaded at the ports of Cadiz and Jerez and immediately assembled to meet the needs of the National Army. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar: A traveler who arrived here today from Cadiz brought a strange message, claiming that Jerez, Cadiz, is currently preparing to accommodate 5,000 Japanese soldiers who will arrive this week to participate in the Spanish Civil War. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[London] People from all walks of life here are astonished to receive reports from Gibraltar that 3,000 Japanese volunteer soldiers are about to arrive in Spain to join the rebel army. They believe that this move by Japan will further worsen the situation in the Mediterranean. However, the above news has not yet been confirmed. (Express News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The newspapers here are very interested after hearing that 3,000 Japanese volunteer soldiers are about to arrive in Spain to help the National Army and are eagerly awaiting a response from the Japanese officialdom. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The news that 5,000 volunteer teams will arrive in Cadiz to participate in the Spanish Civil War this morning was like a bolt from the blue in Tokyo. Although Germany and Japan have signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, Japan has not expressed any intention of intervening in the Spanish dispute diplomatically or militarily. Japanese newspapers and politicians have been criticizing Prime Minister Hirota for failing in his diplomatic policy towards China and Russia and for concluding an untimely German-Japanese agreement. From this point of view, it seems unlikely that the Japanese Prime Minister and his cabinet members would secretly allow untrained volunteer teams to go to the West and face opposition from the people. As for those who have been trained, if they go abroad to participate in the war, they must obtain the permission of the Japanese Emperor, which seems unlikely. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the news from Gibraltar was purely fabricated. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The semi-official news agencies of Britain and France, Havas and Reuters, have been spreading the news that several thousand Japanese volunteer soldiers will assist the Spanish revolutionary army and will land at Cadiz and Jerez on the west coast of Spain. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that this is the most malicious anti-propaganda aimed at exploiting the European political situation and is very angry. This is because the left-wing countries such as France and the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, which hopes to maintain the status quo in Europe, have suffered military setbacks in the recent war supported by the Spanish government army. Therefore, they are spreading the misunderstanding that Japan, which has joined the fascist camp due to the signing of the anti-aircraft agreement between Germany and Japan, has sent volunteers to participate in the Spanish war. It is expected that this kind of propaganda will worsen the opinion of various countries on the fascist camp and make the war favorable to the government army. It can be predicted that the first to spread this rumor was also the European countries that supported the Spanish government army. Although the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed this propaganda with a laugh, if it is left unattended, there is a risk that Japan's fair diplomatic policy towards Europe will be misunderstood by the world. Therefore, Foreign Minister Arita telegraphed Japanese ambassadors in Europe on the 11th to investigate the source of the rumor and at the same time requested the governments of the countries concerned to crack down on this malicious radio broadcast.

<h3>British Government Puts Forward New Proposal to Five Nations</h3>
<p>Advocates Promoting Supervisory Plans; France Expresses Complete Agreement</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the issue of prohibiting volunteers from going to Spain, the British government last night issued identical instructions to the ambassadors of France, Italy, Germany, Portugal, and Russia, ordering them to promptly notify their respective host governments of the British government's new proposal. The instructions are divided into eight sections, excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ All relevant governments have expressed their expectation to immediately adopt various measures to prohibit volunteers from going to Spain. Therefore, three measures have already been agreed upon by the relevant countries: firstly, the measures to prohibit volunteers should be implemented jointly by all participating countries; secondly, the entire issue of indirect interference in the Spanish civil war should also be actively addressed in order to achieve a resolution; thirdly, a practical and effective supervisory system should be established for the measures to prohibit volunteers.</p>
<p>㊁ Regarding the plan to supervise the sea and land borders of Spain, it is currently being considered by the parties involved in the Spanish civil war. The British government now suggests that this supervisory plan should be promoted to include the monitoring of all volunteers, military personnel, and military supplies arriving in Spain by sea and land.</p>
<p>㊂ For this supervisory plan to obtain satisfactory guarantees and effective implementation, the governments participating in the plan must be willing to fulfill their obligations sincerely. The British government believes that this condition can be practically achieved. However, it is possible that the relevant governments may have other views on the various supervisory measures and methods, in addition to those already stated above. If they would kindly provide instructions, the British government would be greatly pleased. In short, the British government is prepared to immediately consider any suggestions put forward to achieve this objective. Furthermore, the British government is also happy to consider any detailed suggestions put forward to monitor other forms of indirect interference, and is prepared to refer these suggestions to the Non-Intervention Committee for adjustment and discussion as a matter of priority.</p>
<p>㊃ At the same time, in the British government's own opinion, since the replies from other governments to the British government have all expressed a desire to prevent foreign volunteers and military personnel from being present in Spain, this expression should be a prelude to the implementation of the prohibition of volunteers going to Spain within the territory of each government. This prohibition can be implemented even before the supervisory system within Spain is fully established.</p>
<p>㊄ The British government intends to immediately and voluntarily issue a proclamation to draw the attention of the general public, making them aware that British subjects who accept recruitment or are willing to be recruited to join the armies of any party in the Spanish civil war are in violation of the "Foreign Enlistment Act" and will be punished accordingly. The same applies to those who recruit volunteers within the territory of the "United Kingdom" to fight in Spain.</p>
<p>㊅ The British government suggests that the official documents exchanged between the relevant countries since December 24th of last year (i.e., the date when the British and French notes were sent), together with this document, should be submitted to the Non-Intervention Committee. If the replies from each country unanimously agree with this suggestion, then the British government will request the Adjustment Committee to determine a date for each government to simultaneously implement the aforementioned measures to prohibit volunteers from going to Spain.</p>
<p>㊆ The British government does not wish to interfere with the actions of the Adjustment Committee. On the contrary, Britain believes that the notes presented by the British and French governments on December 24th are intended to facilitate the work of the Adjustment Committee.</p>
<p>㊇ Please instruct the British ambassadors to Germany, Italy, France, Portugal, and Russia to immediately notify the governments of their respective host countries of the British government's above-mentioned views, and request that they provide a reply as soon as possible. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The British Ambassador to France received instructions from the British government this afternoon to personally deliver the new British proposal regarding the prohibition of volunteers going to Spain to the Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr. Weiyeno. Official sources have stated that the French government will immediately express its full support for this proposal to the British government, and that the French government is prepared to request Parliament to pass laws early next week to stipulate various measures to prohibit volunteers from going to Spain, and to begin implementation when an agreement is reached with the governments of the relevant countries. The French government also intends to take this opportunity to announce these measures to Parliament, in order to expedite the implementation of supervisory measures for non-intervention in the Spanish civil war. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[London] The British Foreign Office has just issued a public announcement, drawing public attention to the fact that the provisions stipulated in the "Foreign Enlistment Act" promulgated in 1870, especially Sections 4 and 5 of the law, are applicable to the current Spanish civil war. Any subject who violates these provisions shall be subject to imprisonment for up to two years, or a fine, or both penalties, according to law. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>French Naval Exercises in the Western Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Ten German Submarines Appearing</p>
<p>[Paris] A correspondent for the Paris Evening News stationed in the International Neutral Zone port of Tangier recently declared that three French warships and one British seaplane conducted exercises yesterday afternoon in the waters off Spanish Morocco, between the ports of Arzeila and Larache. Many British warships were also seen outside the port of Ceuta, and ten German submarines appeared in the same area yesterday. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>France Will Absolutely Not Allow German Troops to Remain in North Africa</h3>
<p>Spanish Moroccan Authorities Have Replied, Stating Their Willingness to Respect Treaties Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>[Paris] According to a spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry today, France will resolutely not allow German troops to remain in Spanish Morocco. Today, France has sent a note to the National Army in Tetuan, the capital of Spanish Morocco. It is not yet possible to say what actions France will take if an unsatisfactory reply is received. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Paris] France has today issued a firm warning to Germany, forbidding Hitler from establishing a foothold in North Africa. Deputy Secretary of State De Saint, speaking in Belfort, stated, "Outsiders must understand that France will not be subdued by force. Therefore, if the flaunting of military power violates treaties or indirectly infringes upon France's rights, it will cut off the opportunity for a peaceful resolution." De Saint also quoted the statement of Prime Minister Blum, saying that France does not believe that war is inevitable and is striving to avoid it, but there are also several things that France cannot tolerate, such as Germany establishing a sphere of influence in North Africa. As for the extent to which Germany's influence in Morocco has expanded, it is currently impossible to know, but it is understood that German hired convoys have landed in Manlila, Tetuan, and near Ceuta. Therefore, the Foreign Office has drafted a protest, which will be submitted to General Franco if the Spanish National Army allows German troops to enter. A spokesperson said that this protest is of a warning nature, as France has stated that if the information currently obtained is confirmed, France will take appropriate measures to deal with it. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Reply from the Spanish Authorities</h3>
<p>[Paris] The French government's note regarding the entry of Germans into Morocco has been satisfactorily answered by the Spanish authorities in Morocco. It is heard that the statement declares that the Spanish authorities do not wish to violate the Franco-Spanish agreements of 1904 and 1912. The Spanish authorities are well aware that the landing of foreign troops in any location in Morocco will cause serious international consequences. According to the Franco-Spanish agreement, foreign troops must not enter Moroccan territory. (The reply was issued by Colonel Pico-Beyde on behalf of General Franco, the leader of the Spanish National Army. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Ambition</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Diplomatic circles say that Germany's activities in Morocco are intended to create a situation that will provide a basis for future demands for African colonies. German leader Hitler believes that if unrest arises on the border of French Morocco, it may cause Britain and France to allow Germany to obtain a colonial center elsewhere. However, Hitler will not risk causing a conflict between France and Germany or between Britain and Germany. If he can obtain a considerable sphere of influence in Africa, he will be satisfied. Afterwards, he can cooperate with Britain and France to stop the Spanish civil war. Hitler's first ambition is to restore Germany's pre-World War colonial status, to avenge the shame of defeat, even if the scope is smaller. The second is to obtain commercial rights in Africa, as Germany's interests in Morocco are only commercial in nature. In the event of military involvement, Britain and France will have extremely severe reactions. However, Germany's ultimate goal will be to restore its pre-war African territories. (National Electric dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Activities of German Troops in North Africa</h3>
<p>Britain and France Receive Information</p>
<p>[Paris] The Paris Evening News recently published a report from the international neutral port of Tangier in North Africa, revealing the activities of Germany in Spanish Morocco, stating: ㊀ The High Commissioner's Office in Tetuan is now managed by German officers regarding scholars, police, and civil affairs. ㊁ The bombardment of the port of Ceuta is also managed by German officers. ㊂ Many German officers and thousands of Germans have settled in Spanish Morocco. ㊃ German naval commander Frole recently went to the Rif region, which is the area bordering French Morocco and Spanish Morocco, to inspect various military road locations. ㊄ Twenty-five German officers recently arrived in Tetuan by Portuguese plane. ㊅ Not long ago, 2,700 German troops landed at the ports of Ceuta and Manlila, and immediately went to the Darifen area to join the foreign legion, all wearing Spanish uniforms. ㊆ Twelve Moroccan indigenous officers are now preparing in Ceuta to receive a large number of German troops. ㊇ German technicians are currently engaged in mining work in various places in Spanish Morocco. In addition, there are 14,000 troops stationed throughout Spanish Morocco, and fortifications have been built in Ceuta and the area bordering French territory, and the airport in Tetuan has been expanded. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[London] The British government has received information confirming that Germany has indeed had considerable activity in Spanish Morocco recently, but the claim that German troops have landed there has not yet been proven. In addition, it has been further confirmed that small-scale construction of forts is indeed underway in Ceuta, and is being assisted by German technicians. However, according to the information currently received, this project does not extend to the city itself (note that the city itself is owned by Spain and has a slightly different status from the territory of Spanish Morocco, as it is nominally under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Morocco). It is heard that Britain has reiterated that it does not consider the situation in Spanish Morocco to be very serious. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Amidst Worsening Franco-German Relations, Hitler Receives Diplomatic Corps</h3>
<p>Says He is Willing to Seek Economic Cooperation with All Countries; Uses Radio for Anti-French Propaganda</p>
<p>[Berlin] The deterioration of Franco-German relations has never been greater since the Nazi Party took power. Hitler suddenly held a meeting today to receive the diplomatic representatives of various countries stationed in Berlin. The war of words between German and French newspapers is rapidly developing. For example, one newspaper pointed out that France wants to wage war in Morocco, and most newspapers say that Germany is willing to warn France at the last hour that Germany is not willing to be fooled. This matter involves the interests of Britain, and Britain must also pay serious attention to it. Foreign diplomats are currently speculating on the meaning of this movement in the German press. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Today, German leader Hitler held a New Year's celebration meeting in Berlin, receiving diplomatic representatives of various countries stationed in Germany. French Ambassador Poncet, on behalf of the Vatican envoy Nansivo, who was unable to attend due to illness, congratulated Hitler. Poncet further expressed the hope that during this New Year, all parties can cooperate to seek future progress, so that all countries at home and abroad can enjoy true peace. Hitler replied that Germany is quite satisfied with the past year. We have increased Germany's economic independence, because we firmly believe that the only solid foundation for the world economy is the stability of individual economic conditions. Therefore, when we instill moral, political, and economic order in the German people, we are also serving the other people of the world. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Hitler, accompanied by Propaganda Minister Goebbels, returned here yesterday from his villa in Berchtesgaden in Bavaria. That evening, all radio stations across the country broadcast three dispatches from Paris received by the semi-official German News Agency. The first dispatch stated that a Soviet Republic will now be established in southern France, with Perpignan in the department of Pyrénées-Orientales as its capital. The second dispatch stated that the French Army General Staff is currently drafting a plan to immediately occupy Spanish Morocco and annex it. The third dispatch stated that France is now planning to intervene in the Spanish civil war, making every effort to assist the Red Army in that country and resist the National Army led by General Franco, and is planning to take the opportunity to send troops to Spanish Morocco, so as to establish a French base opposite British Gibraltar. Well-informed sources in Berlin have recently interpreted these dispatches as saying that this propaganda movement was clearly ordered by leader Hitler and instructed by Propaganda Minister Goebbels to be carried out by the radio stations. Its intention is to target Britain and France obliquely. In fact, France's coveting of Spanish Morocco is unfounded. Germany's fabrication of this rumor is merely a smokescreen to cover up its conspiracy to violate the non-intervention agreement and send troops to Spain. As for the news issued by the German News Agency, its tone is as激烈 as the anti-Russian speeches delivered by senior officials of the National Socialist Party at the Nazi Party Congress held in Nuremberg last September. At that time, German cabinet members openly attacked the people's front governments of various countries, especially the French people's front government, at the conference. Looking back on the past, it can be seen that German policy has been consistent from beginning to end. In addition, regarding the news claimed by Britain and France that German troops had arrived in Spanish Morocco, the German authorities have not effectively denied it. They have only responded to the details published by the French newspapers with insulting words. The French public has already unanimously expressed shock at the arrival of German troops in Spanish Morocco. Germany's actions are intended to alienate French public opinion, thereby alienating Britain and France, in order to shirk all responsibility for Germany itself. This can be seen from the editor's note issued by the German News Agency regarding the news sent by the Paris correspondent. It says, "Britain is now following France's lead, no different from becoming a vassal of France. What does Britain think?" (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>French Moroccan Governor-General Reviews Troops</h3>
<p>Postponement of Army Chief's Trip</p>
<p>Rabat, French Morocco. The French Governor-General of Morocco, General Noguès, held a military parade in Meknes yesterday afternoon. The garrisoned troops marched in formation, with orderly steps. A large number of expatriates from European countries and local indigenous leaders attended the event. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[Paris] French Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier, who was originally scheduled to go to Morocco this week, has decided to postpone his departure today. This reflects France's great concern about the alleged landing of German troops in Spanish Morocco. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Stalemate on the Madrid Front Line</h3>
<p>Rebels Consolidate New Positions, Adopting a Step-by-Step Strategy</p>
<p>Avila. A special dispatch from our correspondent. After the fierce battle on the outskirts of Madrid last week, the battle situation was very calm yesterday, with only air force and artillery units slightly active. The National Army only consolidated its newly occupied positions in order to plan another offensive. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Rebel Camp in Casa de Campo. The rebels have been fighting fiercely for seven days. Today, the Moorish troops and fascist troops are making more vigorous efforts to attack Madrid. The rebel front line, which was only a 16-degree arc last week, has now become 120 degrees, occupying an additional 167 square miles. The strategy now adopted is to tighten the siege, which is different from the previous method of fierce attack. It is planned to advance step by step to achieve the final goal. At the same time, the rebels have cut off the main road from Madrid to El Escorial, so that the government troops have to pass through a 75-mile small road to communicate with El Escorial.

<h3>Japanese Anarchist Party's Revolutionary Conspiracy Exposed</h3>
<p>News of the Incident in February Two Years Ago Was Only Released Yesterday; The Organization Spread Throughout the Country, Centering on Rural Areas</p>
<p>Nagano. In February of Showa 10 (1935), the Japanese Anarchist Communist Party was investigated by the authorities, and the riot conspiracy of the secret society Rural Youth Association was discovered. The authorities immediately prohibited the publication of this news and made every effort to investigate. As a result, it was found that the organization of this conspiracy, with Nagano Prefecture as the center, reached throughout Japan, namely Nagano, Hokkaido, Tokyo, Osaka, Kanagawa, Yamanashi, Saitama, Chiba, Ibaraki, Aichi, Shizuoka, Yamanashi, Fukushima, Aomori, Yamagata, Akita, Okayama, Yamaguchi, Tokushima, Ehime, and Saga prefectures were its base. 390 party members were investigated by the authorities, and most of them had their preliminary trials completed by the end of last year. On the 11th of this month, the ban was lifted. The secret society of anarchists, the Rural Youth Party, was established in February of Showa 6 (1931) and set up its headquarters at 932 Meguro, Tokyo. The organization of its society was dissolved in September of Showa 7 (1932), but it continued to operate with its spirit as its guiding principle. The anarchist party in the past focused on theoretical struggle, but this group focused its main force on daily struggle, and centered on rural areas, adopting a so-called autonomous decentralized joint organization, that is, using villages in natural terrain as the basic body to carry out autonomous decentralized movements. First, it sought to enrich the interior of a village, and gradually expanded to other villages. In October of Showa 6 (1931), when cocoon prices in Nagano Prefecture fell sharply and the rural areas were extremely poor, it took advantage of the opportunity to sharpen the consciousness of farmers and attempted to carry out an armed riot in order to realize a national violent revolution. However, its plan was discovered in advance and could not be realized. It is heard that the party members went to Shanghai to buy weapons or organized theft gangs to obtain stolen money and were making active preparations step by step. When the authorities conducted an investigation, they gradually discovered a shocking conspiracy, and all members of the prosecutor's office were shocked. (Allied News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Discover Black Terrorist Group</h3>

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Postpones Meeting</h3>
<p>In Response to Turkey's Request; League of Nations Personnel Inspect Antioch; Turkish Radicals Demonstrate</p>
<p>[Geneva] Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chairman of the League of Nations Administrative Council and the Chinese Ambassador to France, has today agreed to the request of the French and Turkish governments to postpone the Administrative Council meeting scheduled to be held on the 18th of this month to the 21st of this month. This action is sufficient to indicate that the direct negotiations between France and Turkey regarding the issue of Alexandretta, which are currently underway, may achieve a satisfactory resolution. It is reported that France and Turkey had a dispute over Alexandretta and Antioch in Syria, which caused general concern at the beginning of this month. The French press believed that Turkey would annex the two places by force, and France would not tolerate this. However, according to the latest situation, Turkey does not want to annex the two places, but only advocates allowing them to be independent. Therefore, France solemnly declared that France is willing to listen to the League of Nations' adjudication of this dispute. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Antioch. The three neutral inspectors sent by the League of Nations Administrative Council (namely Norwegian diplomat Holstet, Dutch colonial senior official Kana, and Swiss army officer Colonel Tevantville) set off this afternoon to the nearby city of Reyhanlı (50 kilometers away). They will meet with representatives of Turks and Arabs at the city hall to listen to their opinions. At that time, more than 300 moderate Turks cheered and paid tribute to the neutral inspectors, and most Arabs echoed them. Before long, many radical Turks gathered, using sticks to beat the Arabs, and a conflict broke out between the two sides, throwing bricks and stones at each other, and even opening up with pistols and shotguns. The son of the chairman of the local city council even seized a rifle carried by a gendarme and joined the Turkish side, but was immediately arrested. During the disturbances, the neutral inspectors witnessed the incident on the balcony of the city hall. A cavalry team rushed to the scene to suppress it, and the demonstrators fled in all directions, and order was restored. During the battle, one Arab died, and two Turks and eleven Arabs were injured to varying degrees. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>Impending Reopening of Parliament - The Government Encounters Difficulties</h3>
<p>Close Air in the Political-Civilian Alliance</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The parliament, after its recess, will reconvene in ten days. The political atmosphere is increasingly tense. Although members of both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have entered the cabinet, the future of the parliament is not entirely optimistic. This is because both the Seiyukai and Minseito, as well as a faction within the House of Peers, intend to conduct a thorough review of the government's proposed tax increase bill, electricity control bill, extension of compulsory education, and other measures related to national policy control. In particular, the Seiyukai and Minseito seem to be forming a united front against the Hirota Cabinet's foreign policy. Furthermore, in order to restore the credibility of political parties in this parliamentary session, it is expected that the two major parties will maintain close ties and act together. On one hand, the government is working through cabinet members from both parties to seek their understanding. On the other hand, Prime Minister Hirota is visiting the presidents of both parties, and Secretary-General Tanuma is hosting banquets for the executive members of both parties, all in an effort to dispel the somber atmosphere in advance. Judging from the current situation, it will be difficult for the government to overcome the obstacles in the parliament. The fate of many important cases is highly concerning.

<h3>Labor Strikes in the United States</h3>
<p>Negotiations in Automobile Industry Break Down; Glimmer of Hope for Resolution in Seamen's Strike</p>
<p>Detroit: Negotiations to resolve the strike in the American automobile industry broke down at the end of the week due to a failure to compromise on the issue of removing workers who are squatting in the factories and refusing to work. Approximately 100,000 people are currently unemployed. General Motors plans to continue closing several factories within days due to material shortages. The company is now willing to negotiate with union representatives as soon as the workers leave the factories, but rejects the union's condition of two people leaving, as accepting it would be tantamount to condoning illegal squatting. (Eleventh Day, Reuters)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] The president of the Shipping Association, White, telegraphed President Roosevelt today, saying that he expects the seamen's strike to end soon, or perhaps even be resolved within a few days. However, union representative Meynekov stated that negotiations for the seamen's strike could break down at any time, and that only ten of the twenty-one agreements are currently being negotiated. If one fails, all efforts will be in vain. (Tenth Day, Kuo Min News Agency)</p>

<h3>Japanese Raise Funds to Promote the Northeast Five-Year Industrial Plan</h3>
<p>Political Instability Causes Japanese Capitalists to Invest Cautiously; The Japanese Government Encourages and Guides Capital Flow to the Northeast</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: The Northeast Five-Year Industrial Plan, under the direction of the Japanese, requires the mobilization of ample and extremely large funds for all facilities. Although the puppet organization has issued 150 million yuan in bonds, its underwriting institution is solely the puppet Central Bank. According to the Japanese side, the puppet Central Bank lacks a solid foundation and is prone to extreme danger in the event of an accident. Therefore, it is necessary to pay close attention to the puppet organization's future internal debt issuances. The next issue is the foreign debt problem, which is the so-called Japanese investment in the puppet "Manchukuo." The total necessary expenses for the Northeast production increase plan amount to 1.5 billion yuan, and the majority of the funds must be sought from the Japanese domestic financial market. However, Japan's financial situation is affected by the annual accumulation of deficit government bonds, which impacts investment in the Northeast. Even with this constraint, the Japanese financial community is勉强investing in the Northeast, albeit with an extremely cautious attitude, which is more active than in previous years. Therefore, the Japanese are using this point as evidence of the Japanese financial capital's understanding of the puppet organization, and Prime Minister Hirota is recognizing the national policy and encouraging investment in the Northeast, guiding Japanese financial capital towards the "Manchuria," which the Japanese envision will yield great returns in the future. It is not difficult to supply funds of approximately 100 million yuan annually starting this year. However, how to raise the massive 1.5 billion yuan needed for the implementation of the five-year plan is a major question. Therefore, Japanese financiers are facing serious difficulties in developing the Northeast Five-Year Industrial Plan due to the instability of the Northeast's security situation, the fluctuating tensions in the Far East, and the active implementation of a wartime system by Japanese military and political figures in the Northeast. This deters Japanese domestic capitalists from investing in the Northeast. Furthermore, based on the current fate of Japanese domestic industries, there is already a long-standing conflict of interest between Korean industries and Japanese domestic industries, and the appropriate implementation and resolution of industrial controls is a long-standing issue. In addition, some Japanese domestic capitalists regard the Northeast as a colony of Japanese imperialism, only recognizing the sales of their own goods and not recognizing enterprises in "Manchuria." One of the three principles of the Japanese Five-Year Industrial Plan for the Northeast is to prevent border smuggling, encourage exports, and seek to prevent oversupply through production increases as a means of adjustment. All aspects related to the industrial sector will adopt a national management system for the entire industrial sector, and Japan and "Manchukuo" will conclude treaties to restrict industrial control imports and exports in order to achieve technical solutions. In addition, Matsui, the director of the Resources Bureau dispatched by the Japanese government, has completed inspections of Northeast, Korea, and North China and proposed to the Japanese cabinet to establish a Continental Industry Survey Committee. The steps to be taken are to break through all current difficulties, seek close coordination between Japanese officials and civilians, and complete the so-called Northeast Five-Year Industrial Plan.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Expands Anti-Smuggling Efforts</h3>
<p>Anti-Smuggling Troops in Chao-Shan Increased to Nine Hundred; Various Agencies Also Effectively Coordinate Anti-Smuggling Efforts</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After Guangdong Province strengthened anti-smuggling efforts last year, customs tax revenue increased by more than 1.3 million customs gold yuan starting in October. Zhang Junshong, the director of the Anti-Smuggling Headquarters, decided this spring to divide the entire province into fifty anti-smuggling districts and one hundred inspection checkpoints, distributed in coastal counties. The local anti-smuggling troops were reorganized into regiments, with Zhang concurrently serving as the regimental commander. Below the regimental commander were large, medium, and small squads, and several inspectors were added and assigned to serve in various locations. In the future, matters related to the suppression of opium, salt administration, tungsten ore, and tax inspections by the Finance Department will be handled by the Anti-Smuggling Headquarters to centralize authority. The anti-smuggling draft law decided last year has been submitted to the Generalissimo's Headquarters and the Ministry of Finance for approval and implemented from New Year's Day this year in accordance with the original plan. The Chao-Mei area is of particular concern and attention. Recently, Feng Gaoyi was appointed as the director of the Chao-Mei Opium Suppression and Anti-Smuggling Inspection Office, which works jointly with the provincial water and land anti-smuggling sub-bureaus. Now, the province has sent three large squads of 900 anti-smuggling soldiers to Shantou to establish anti-smuggling sub-checkpoints in various counties, in order to make anti-smuggling work twice as strict as last year. Whenever ships enter the port of Shantou from other locations, the customs dispatches two electric boats to monitor them in rotation, prohibiting small boats from approaching and transporting smuggled goods. If any small boats deliberately approach, the boatmen will be detained and fined, and the small boats will be sawed in half and placed in front of the customs for public display. The customs also effectively coordinates with agencies such as the Agricultural Products Special Tax Bureau, the Salt Police, and the Tungsten Ore Purchasing Office to establish an anti-smuggling network. The water and land anti-smuggling bureaus have added six patrol ships - "Nuli," "Chenggong," "Haiping," "Haikang," "Haiwei," and "Haiwu" - to patrol the coastal areas of Chao-Shan in order to supplement the customs' insufficient strength. As for the private anti-smuggling associations spontaneously organized by Chao-Shan merchants, following New Year's Day, guilds such as the rice industry and the electric transport industry continued to be established, strengthening defenses to prevent the intrusion of smuggled goods. However, the Japanese ruffians are devising various schemes, often asking traitors to impersonate local residents, fraudulently renting civilian houses, and then failing to report to the Public Security Bureau for registration and pay sanitation fees, leading to frequent disputes with landlords. If the anti-smuggling force is sufficient and the private anti-smuggling efforts are strict, the ruffians' schemes will surely be in vain.</p>
<h3>Economic Improvement in Jiangxi Province Last Year</h3>
<p>Increased Exports of Crops and Special Products; Rural Purchasing Power Also Increased Slightly Compared to Before</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi is an important agricultural area in the Yangtze River region, with abundant production of crops, rural sideline industries, and handicrafts. However, due to the continuous impact of banditry and natural disasters in recent years, the entire social economy has been almost completely bankrupt. Fortunately, the banditry in various places was suppressed the year before last, and the majority of displaced farmers returned home to make a living. Last year, the weather was favorable, and both the upper and lower halves of the year saw bumper harvests. Grain prices also rebounded sharply, with prices above three yuan in all but the most remote villages. The rural economy improved, and the social economy showed signs of recovery. At the same time, various special products also saw a turnaround in fortune. According to estimates by the industrial and commercial sectors, last year: 1) Porcelain, which had annual sales of 15 million yuan in its heyday, had annual sales of only over 2 million yuan in recent years. Last year, due to the promotion by the authorities and the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, sales soared to 10 million yuan. 2) Lian Shi, Mao Bian, Heng Jiang, and other types of paper also saw sales rebound to over 2 million yuan last year. 3) Although bamboo and wood prices were not very high last year, sales in the Nanjing and Lower Yangtze areas improved compared to the previous year. 4) Tea, such as Ninghong, saw prices increase and sales double last year due to the government's unified control and transportation, and there is hope for restoring international credibility. 5) Rice: Rice prices in Shanghai and Hankou were mostly above eight to ten yuan last year, and exports from this province were extremely enthusiastic. Currently, the authorities are also forming a large-scale transportation and sales company, utilizing the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Guangdong-Han Railways to promote sales to Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces in order to replace Siamese and Annam rice. There is hope for exporting six million bags next year. 6) Hand-woven cloth, which was previously a common rural handicraft, has been squeezed out by machine-woven fabrics and foreign cloth in recent years and is no longer sought after. Rural women are at a loss. Last year, due to the great demand for cloth in rural areas, hand-woven cloth also saw 2 million yuan in business. 7) Due to the legal tender system last year, the exchange rate rose, and various exports benefited greatly. The sales and exports of other products such as tungsten ore, tobacco, and oil were also better than in previous years. Therefore, those engaged in export trade last year all had a slight surplus. Those engaged in import trade, such as cotton yarn, white sugar, piece goods, sugar, kerosene, and hardware, also had profits without losses due to the slight increase in farmers' purchasing power, brisk sales, and rising prices. However, retailers in this city are still facing closures due to high expenses and sharp declines in production. (January 6)</p>

<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Police Detectives Mistakenly Injure Merchants</p>
<p>Recently, an attempted robbery occurred at the home of Zhou Shugui, a resident of Xianghua Bridge Town. Afterwards, he received a threatening letter from the bandits, agreeing on a meeting place behind the electric lamp factory in Liuhe Town. Zhou, the person in charge, wrote a letter to the Public Security Bureau reporting the incident. Yang Meilin, the director of the bureau, ordered a patrol team and others to rush to the agreed location on the night of the tenth, and placed a paper bag in the area. Police detectives ambushed around the area. Unexpectedly, Yao Fukui, the bookkeeper of the Yihe Cake Shop in the town, was passing by and saw an item left behind and bent over to pick it up. The ambushing police suspected him of being a bandit and surrounded and arrested him. Yao hurriedly tried to escape, and the police detective pulled out a gun and fired, the bullet entering from the left side of his chest, causing him to fall to the ground injured. Residents heard the sound and gathered, recognizing Yao as a normal merchant, and rushed him to Huizhong Hospital for treatment. His life is in danger. After the incident, the public was indignant and immediately held a citizens' meeting and sent a car to Taicang to ask County Magistrate Wen to go to Liu to investigate. As the county magistrate was ill in bed, he sent Secretary Fang and Director Yang to Liu to investigate.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Murder Case in the Sixth District During Gambling Arrest</p>
<p>Zhang Suizhi, a farmer in Zhouxiang Township, Sixth District of this county, held a gathering for gambling on the sixth of this month to celebrate the wedding of his cousin. The district police officer in charge became aware of this and rushed to arrest Zhang Suizhi and the gambler Zhou Guangquan and sent them to the Zhangpu Second Sub-Bureau for transfer to the county government for handling. However, Zhou Guangquan was beaten and injured during the transfer, so when the court opened on the eighth, Zhou immediately accused police officer Zhou Xialin of causing the injury. The court ordered a supplementary statement for further verification. Unexpectedly, Zhou Guangquan died from his injuries at 3:30 PM on the ninth. The district chief of the mountain district reported to the county for an autopsy. An autopsy revealed a scar on his lower abdomen, which was light red in color, indicating that he may have died from the injury. After inspecting the coffin, it was transported to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute on the tenth for a second autopsy to ensure thoroughness. Meanwhile, the Public Security Bureau placed the responsible police officer under guard and sent him to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Truth Revealed in Bizarre Murder Case in Shazhou</p>
<p>On New Year's Day this year, a bizarre murder case occurred in the Xian surname cemetery in Sansheng Township, Shazhou City. The deceased had seven or eight knife wounds all over his body, and the corpse was burned with fire, blurring his face beyond recognition. After the county government inspected the body, no family members claimed it, leading to a delay of many days. By the evening of the tenth, a friend of the deceased came forward to report the incident. It was revealed that the deceased was named Mao Jinbiao, the squad leader of the Chuangang Security Team in Nantong (this place is at the intersection of Tong and Chang). The person who came forward to report the incident was Mao's subordinate, named Guo Jinkui. Guo, a native of Xuzhou, was a compatriot of Mao. He was once so poor that he had no place to stand, and he was able to join the security team and enlist thanks to Mao's recommendation. After enlisting, the two had a friendly relationship. However, Mao's wife was unfaithful and became acquainted with Liu Longqing of Shang Erweigang, with whom she had frequent contact. Mao himself learned of this and consulted Guo Jinkui about countermeasures, planning to sue the county government. Unexpectedly, the adulterer took advantage of Guo's business trip and, knowing that Mao was outnumbered, devised a plan to kill Mao and burn his body in an attempt to eliminate the traces. Mao's wife then moved in with Liu. When Guo Gongxue returned to Shi Erweigang on the evening of the ninth, he learned that Squad Leader Mao had suddenly disappeared and then learned of the strange corpse in the Qian surname cemetery. He went to investigate in detail and found that the clothing was indeed that of Squad Leader Mao. After various investigations, he learned that Liu Longqing must have committed the crime, so he reported to the district office and sent the police to arrest the murderer. Unexpectedly, Liu had already heard the news and fled far away with the woman, and only his elderly mother, Chen, was arrested at home. She has already been sent to the city. It is expected that this case will soon come to light. According to the previous statements made by the plaintiff Guo Jinkui in court, he said that he was avenging his friend.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>New City Gate to Be Added to Xu Gate</p>
<p>The Suzhou urban area has decided to invest 290,000 yuan this year to carry out major construction, with particular emphasis on widening the streets. The Construction Bureau has proposed to build a new city gate on the side of the Xu Gate, directly facing the Wannian Bridge in the area, due to the curvature of the Xu Gate and the streets, which is not suitable for the development of transportation. This will unify the development of internal and external transportation and commerce, while the old Xu Gate will be preserved without being filled in.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Prime Culprit in Revenge Killing Case Apprehended</p>
<p>The Fan Hongyu silk and foreign goods store in Guqiao, Beiqiaokou, outside the North Gate of this county, experienced a major revenge killing case in the summer of last year. At that time, Fan Hangen, the small shopkeeper of the store, was shot and killed by thugs. The mistress Fan Zhou, and Fan Xiuqin, two sister-in-laws, were also shot and injured. Fortunately, they were treated quickly and recovered. However, the case remained unsolved for a long time after it occurred. Recently, the store owner Fan Xingbo received a threatening letter from thugs demanding a large sum of money. As Fan could not afford to pay, he had to temporarily take refuge elsewhere and reported to the Public Security Bureau asking for an arrest. At about 2:00 AM on the morning of the eleventh, Zhang Qian, a political police officer from the Public Security Bureau, was inspecting hotels on the road and found a traveler named Pan Renjie (from Bao Ying) suspicious in Room 25 of the Shenjiang Hotel on Tonghui Road. He interrogated him, but his speech was evasive. He was taken to the bureau and placed under strict guard. The person was found to be closely related to the revenge killing case. The bureau ordered Fan Xingbo and Fan Zhou, the parties involved, to come to the bureau to identify him. After examining his appearance, they confirmed that he was indeed one of the main culprits at the scene. According to Pan Renjie's interrogation, his confession was cunning. He only stated that he had previously served as a police officer in the Fifth Sub-Bureau and worked under Ding Lei in the Shanghai Court. The case is still under investigation, and it is heard that the extortionist in this case has also been arrested and is scheduled to be sent to the headquarters for questioning on the eleventh.</p>

<p>Thugs Rob at Market Opening</p>
<p>Qianqiufang in Wuyi is a bustling market. At about 8:00 PM on the tenth, Huang, the mistress of the Xia Yuheng goods store in the area, put the legal tender subsidiary coins and silver dollars earned from the day's business into her wallet. At that time, a young man of about twenty years of age came to the store in the name of buying cigarettes and snatched Huang's wallet and fled. The report was quickly sent to the First Sub-Bureau of Public Security for pursuit, but the thugs had already fled without a trace.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Female Teacher's Love Letter Involved in Litigation</p>
<p>Chen Zhongfen, a teacher at the Shanghai Women and Children's Middle School, had five love letters found by her husband, Jin Zuren, who suspected that she was having an affair. He filed a lawsuit with the Nantong District Court to divorce his wife. Jin Zuren is employed as the deputy director of the Dasheng Yarn Factory. The plaintiff and defendant are both members of the educated class, and curious men and women are vying to watch the trial. Jin testified in court that he had been married to Chen Zhongfen for three years, but had only lived together for nine days. Chen said that the love letter was written by her same-sex friend Chen Zuiyu. Judge Shao then summoned Chen Zuiyu to verify the handwriting. Chen Zhongfen also defended herself, saying that the reason for not living together was that her husband suffered from gonorrhea. If he could produce a health certificate, there would be no problem. The interrogator said that the witnesses were not complete and postponed the hearing for further summons.</p>
<p>Opium Suppression Team Investigates Squeeze</p>
<p>Tongyi handled the general re-examination of opium addiction. Officials from various agencies formed an opium suppression team to supervise the district, township, and baojia chiefs to conduct a general investigation of households. The police of the water and land teams inspected boats, vehicles, and pedestrians at ports and stations. The county government also sent special commissioners to inspect the roads separately.</p>

<h3>The Situation in Xi'an is Gradually Unfolding; Public Groups in Various Cities Yesterday Telegraphically Urged Xi Yu</h3>
<p>Please Urge the Central Government Not to Be Overly Lenient in Order to Curb the Seeds of Rebellion; Advise Yang Yu and Others to Prioritize the Nation and the People</p>
<p>The 173 trade associations in this city, including the Banking Association, as well as 63 Shanghai Fellow Provincial Associations from Shaoxing and other places, the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, and other groups, yesterday, due to the tense situation in Xi'an, jointly issued the following three key telegrams:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central Government</p>
<p>Since the Xi'an Incident occurred, the whole country has been indignant. Fortunately, our Central Government handled it appropriately, and inspired by the great personality of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the incident was quickly quelled. The nation and the people are truly fortunate. Zhang Xueliang's act of rebelling against his superiors is an unforgivable crime. However, Chairman Chiang generously pardoned him, and the Central Government granted him amnesty, opening a path for him to reform and atone for his sins by meritorious service. Yang Yu and others requested punishment, which was also leniently considered to show leniency. This was done because at this time of national unification, we should devote ourselves to saving the nation and preserving our strength, and therefore special consideration was given. The Central Government's handling of the aftermath of this incident took into account both legal principles and human sentiments, and was universally admired by the people of the country. Their painstaking efforts to maintain local stability and care for the officers and soldiers were even more admired by the entire country. Unexpectedly, more than two weeks have passed, and we have heard that the troops under Yang and others have not shown any intention of complying with the orders. Could it be that they still do not prioritize the nation and intend to rely on their fortified positions to deploy troops in an attempt to fulfill their wild ambitions? If so, they intentionally destroy unity, provide the enemy with opportunities to invade, and willingly rebel, what more can be said? In order to lay the foundation for saving the nation and resisting foreign aggression, we should ask the Central Government to send troops to suppress them in order to curb the seeds of rebellion. It is the will of the people of the entire country that those who resist orders should be severely punished, which is definitely not comparable to a civil war. Do not be overly lenient, this is what we hope and pray for. The telegram is filled with urgent anticipation for orders.</p>
<p>Warning to Yang Yu</p>
<p>In this Xi'an Incident, you, gentlemen, made a big mistake. Fortunately, our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, inspired by his great personality, and the Central Government's appropriate handling, quickly quelled the incident, avoiding a major disaster. The region was spared devastation, and the nation's strength was not diminished. However, in order to rectify party discipline and uphold national law, Zhang Xueliang had to be punished. But Chiang Kai-shek, with his benevolent heart, requested and received Central Government approval for a special pardon. Your request for punishment was also leniently considered and not deeply investigated, in order to show leniency. Legal principles and human sentiments were both taken into account, public opinion supported it, and the will of the people was united. How should you, gentlemen, not feel grateful and understand the Central Government's painstaking efforts to protect the region and its officers and soldiers? You should quickly comply with the orders regarding the plans for the rehabilitation of military and political affairs in Shaanxi and Gansu, and atone for your sins by meritorious service. Unexpectedly, two weeks have passed, and we have not seen any real compliance. Could it be that you do not accept even this, and still want to wield your troops and act like a warlord, relying on your fortified positions to resist, and repeat the old drama of warlords? The people of the country all hope for national unity to resist foreign aggression and save the nation. If you, gentlemen, insist on violating the will of the people, in order to lay the foundation for saving the nation and resisting foreign aggression, we have no choice but to petition the Central Government to launch a large-scale attack and severely punish those who resist orders. Where will you, gentlemen, find a place to stand in this world? We earnestly hope that you will prioritize the nation and the people, and strictly comply with the orders as soon as possible, obey the Central Government, and be loyal to the Party and the country, in order to live up to the expectations of the people. We tearfully present our words and await your wise instructions.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Whole Country</p>
<p>To all political and military organs, legal entities, and newspapers across the country: We have just submitted a document to the Central Government (see above, omitted). The national crisis is deepening, and we cannot resist foreign aggression without first pacifying the country.

<h3>Tan Lianfang Discusses the Resolution of the Sino-French Border Issue</h3>
<p>The French Side Has Agreed to Return the Boundary Markers to Their Original Locations; Relations are Quite Good, and There Will Be No Problems in the Future</p>
<p>Tan Lianfang, the Special Commissioner for the Defense of the Guilin-Longzhou Area, arrived in Shanghai yesterday with the Guangxi Domestic Inspection Group. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency paid a special visit to Tan at his temporary residence yesterday to inquire about the recent dispute over the Sino-French Buminquan border area. According to Tan, the Sino-French border in Guangxi Province was initially 910 kilometers long. Boundary markers were originally erected, which were established after the Sino-French War. During the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Communists occupied Guangxi, and the Buminquan area on the border between Guangxi and Vietnam was also occupied. At that time, the people of French Vietnam also suffered casualties. When the Communists were being suppressed, the people of French territory took the opportunity to move boundary marker No. 41 into Guangxi, about 10 kilometers. Afterwards, our side discovered this, and the Sino-French border dispute arose. The result of negotiations between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the French side was that a joint committee was formed by both sides to survey everything. After the survey, the French side has now admitted that the boundary marker was moved and has agreed to voluntarily return the boundary marker to its original location based on geographical and historical facts. Therefore, this Sino-French border dispute has been completely resolved. Tan also said that the current relations between the two countries' peoples on the Sino-French border are quite harmonious. The Guangxi Provincial Government also adheres to the principle of peaceful cooperation and equal coexistence in handling all matters in the border area, so there should be no more disputes in the future.</p>
<h3>British Export Credits Guarantee Department Representative Patrick Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>His Task is to Continue the Unfinished Work of Sir Arthur Salter; Seeking Avenues for British Investment in China; Establishing British Export Credit Relations with China</p>
<p>Patrick, a representative of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:00 am aboard the British India Steam Navigation Company's ship "Rawalpindi," accompanied by his wife and assistant Mr. O'Leary. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival Details</p>
<p>The ship docked at the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Ltd. wharf on East Broadway Road. Those who went to the ship to welcome him included Kong Xiangxi's representative from the Ministry of Finance, Xi Demao and Lin Shiliang, Zhang Jia'ao's representative from the Ministry of Railways, Xia Peng, the British Consul-General Brenan's representative, Mr. Basil, the Commercial Counselor Beal's representative, Mr. Mackinnon, the financial adviser Mr. Hallpatch, and the British adviser to the Central Bank Mr. Rogers. Finance Minister Kong also presented a flower basket. Mr. Patrick exchanged brief greetings with the welcoming party and then went ashore, taking a car to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund to rest. He also sent his assistant Mr. O'Leary to the British Embassy office in the Jardine Matheson Building to arrange everything. He plans to meet with British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen before going to Beijing to pay a visit to our country's authorities.</p>
<p>Spoken Remarks</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Patrick met with reporters and made a statement. This is my first time coming to China, and I am very pleased. In the future, I plan to visit government authorities and leaders from all walks of life in your country to enhance personal friendship and promote Sino-British trade. This is to continue the unfinished work of Sir Arthur Salter. My task is to represent British exporters, investigate the market situation in your country, and find avenues for British investment. I will prepare a report and submit it to the Advisory Committee on Foreign Trade of the British government. This committee is composed of leaders from the domestic banking and business communities. After they discuss and consider it, they will decide on a plan and submit it to the government. Then, the Export Credits Guarantee Department will introduce it to British merchants and provide them with guarantees to establish export credit relations with China. In short, the British government will provide merchants with guarantees to sell goods to China on credit. This is what banks and merchants of all countries can do, and it is not that the British side wants to monopolize the Chinese market. At this point, a reporter asked Mr. Patrick how much money the UK would lend to China. Mr. Patrick did not give a specific answer, but reiterated that his task was only to investigate and advise, not to negotiate loans. He was also asked whether British merchants could consider the interests of Chinese consumers and reduce prices to increase British exports to China. Mr. Patrick said that since British goods exported to China have not increased in price in recent years, there is no need to consider this matter at present. Finally, Mr. Patrick stated his impressions after arriving in China, saying that China is trending towards stability and progress, just as Sir Arthur Salter and the American Far East Inspection Group said, so this trip is very optimistic. Mr. Patrick will stay for about five or six months and will go to major commercial ports for inspection before returning to his country to report to the government and contact British manufacturers, and then come to China again to continue his work.</p>

<h3>Wang Yu and Others Jointly Initiate the Development of Sichuan and Xikang Industries</h3>
<p>The Xichuan Enterprise Company Will Be Organized and Opened Next Month; Zhu Lianfu Will Be Sent to Sichuan to Prepare for the Establishment of a Large Ice Factory</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, and others in this city, in order to develop the industries of Sichuan and Xikang and communicate commerce between Shanghai and Sichuan, have initiated the collection of large amounts of capital to organize the Xichuan Enterprise Co., Ltd., which will be officially opened next month. A reporter has specially compiled the details as follows:</p>
<p>Famous Figures in This City Jointly Initiate</p>
<p>The Xichuan Enterprise Company began preparations in the second half of last year. It was initiated by more than ten giants in the industrial and commercial circles, including Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Weiru, and Zhang Ziquan. It was also supported by Central Committee member Chu Minyi and Commander Yang Hu (Xiaotian), Hubei Finance Director Jia Shiyi, and others. It has collected huge amounts of capital and has now established an office in the Kenyeda Building on Beijing Road in Shanghai to actively prepare. General Manager Zhu Lianfu has made a special trip to Chongqing to prepare and discuss business, and a general branch will be established in Chongqing in the future. Shanghai will establish a general management office to be responsible for hosting everything. The first batch of national products needed in Sichuan has been shipped in advance the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Introducing National Products for Import into Sichuan</p>
<p>The company's main business goal is to introduce Sichuan specialties to Shanghai and then export them to various places so that Sichuan goods can circulate smoothly throughout the country. At the same time, it will unite with national product manufacturers in Shanghai to transport national products to Sichuan as much as possible. It is currently in contact with various national product manufacturers, and many factories have actively participated in recent days. The manufacturers that have already participated include Deyu Battery Factory, Dahua Iron and Steel Factory, Shanghai Fish Market, China Pencil Factory, Shengde Weaving Factory, Xiang Sheng Embroidery Weaving Factory, Huanan Electrical Appliance Factory, Shuanglun Toothbrush Factory, Guangming Thermos Factory, Meixin Bakelite Factory, Xinhua Glass Factory, and several other companies.</p>
<p>Nationals Establish Their Own Ice Factory in Chongqing</p>
<p>In addition, the company, in view of the transportation of various fresh goods from Shanghai to Sichuan and the lack of refrigeration equipment in Sichuan, which caused a lot of inconvenience, and although there is currently the Yufu Ice Factory established in Chongqing, it is purely operated by foreigners, and the machinery is old (purchased in 1921), so very little ice is produced, and it is not enough to meet the demand. Sichuan merchants feel very distressed. The company has decided to establish a large-scale ice factory in Chongqing. Zhu Lianfu's trip this time included planning the establishment of the ice factory. At the same time, the company has also established contact with the Minsheng Industrial Company. The Minsheng ships all have refrigeration equipment, so the entry of fish market and other fresh goods into Sichuan in the future should not be hindered. It is also learned that Zhu will return to Shanghai in about a month, and at that time, a shareholders' meeting will be convened to elect directors and officially open the company.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Only Started Handling Official Business Yesterday</h3>

<h3>The Trade Union Requests Continued Negotiations on the Inspection of Factories in the Special District</h3>
<p>Our local correspondent for the Foreign News Agency reports that the issue of factory inspections in the Special District, which has been virtually stalled for a long time, is currently being petitioned to the municipal government by the Municipal Industrial Federation for continued negotiations. According to the opinions of the industrialists in the association, in order to send out various facilities within the factories, there should be this main inspection agency in the Special District. The municipal government should not delay the decision due to the excuse of consular jurisdiction by the Concession authorities. Furthermore, in view of the frequent occurrence of accidents in the factories within the Concession, it is necessary to resolve them quickly so that various factories can be subject to appropriate and necessary supervision. Last week, this newspaper learned from the General Manager, Mr. Fessenden, that he had submitted other solutions to the Secretary-General of the municipal government, Yu Hongjun, regarding future methods, but Mr. Fessenden refused to disclose the content, only saying that it was just a tentative opinion. However, as far as this newspaper (the Continental Daily) knows, he still insists on the original proposal that the Municipal Council should draft its regulations for factory inspections within the Concession based on the Central Government's Factory Law. Currently, this suggestion is still being studied in detail by the Ministry of Industry, and the municipal government denies the rumor that the Ministry of Industry has agreed to it and specifically ordered Secretary-General Yu to continue negotiations. Mr. Fessenden's proposal to submit this compromise suggestion is intended to eliminate the obstacles caused by the dispute over extraterritoriality, which has led to the overturning of the draft agreement negotiated for five years. Fessenden hopes that the Municipal Council will draft the Municipal Council's regulations based on the Factory Law to remove the opposition from the consular corps due to the damage to the treaty and treaty interests, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Match Production and Sales Cooperative Society Hospitably Received Chinese and Foreign Journalists Yesterday</h3>
<p>Set to Begin Operations on the First Day of Next Month</p>
<p>The China National Match Production and Sales Cooperative Society, approved by the Ministry of Industry, having prepared for many years, has established a general office in Shanghai, as well as three regional branch offices in Central China, North China, and Shandong-Henan, and has collected one-quarter of its capital (1.25 million yuan). It is scheduled to commence operations on February 1st. The society specially hosted a banquet last night for reporters from various Chinese and foreign newspapers in the city, with over fifty attendees. Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the general office, Xu Zhiyi, Managing Director, Ueda Kenjiro, Supervisor He Shichang, and Zhao Xuanqing, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the branch offices, were present to host. During the banquet, Liu, Xu, and others reported on the progress of the preparations, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Speech by Liu Hongsheng</p>
<p>Mr. Liu said in his speech, "Thank you all for gracing us with your presence today, giving us an opportunity to gather in the New Year. I am truly grateful. The preparations for the national match cooperative have been underway for more than eight months now. You must all be very concerned about such a large-scale cooperative undertaking. Now that this matter has made considerable progress, we will first take this opportunity to invite our Managing Director to give you a brief report. After the report, please enjoy a few more drinks. However, please forgive any shortcomings in our hospitality. Now, I would like to propose a toast to everyone here, wishing you progress in the New Year and all the best." After finishing his speech, it was translated into Japanese.</p>
<p>Report by Xu Zhiyi</p>
<p>Mr. Xu then reported, "The match industry is facing an obvious fact that it cannot survive due to overproduction, which needs no further elaboration. The purpose of this cooperative is to collaborate with each other to achieve common survival and prosperity. All the society's articles of association and relief plans have been submitted to the government for approval and have been ordered to all regions within five years, not to add new factories, in order to safeguard. Since being approved to prepare in March last year, it has not been established early due to the complexity of the situation. Now, it has gradually begun to take shape and will be opened on time. The general situation of the society is hereby briefly reported as follows: ㊀ The capital of the society is set at 5 million yuan in national currency, and one-quarter (1.25 million yuan) will be collected when it opens. ㊁ The society and the general office will establish branch offices in Shanghai and in various regions (divided according to the unified tax regions).

<h3>Economic Expert Jin Guobao Discusses Special Cash Guarantee Methods</h3>
<p>Believes That All Parties Concerned Benefit</p>
<p>Since the report stated that Mr. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Shanghai Banking Association, reported that he decided to implement a special cash guarantee method, people from all walks of life regarded this matter as a major reform of the banking personnel system, so they all paid close attention to it, and it was heard that one or two banks are about to implement it. The reporter specially visited the economic expert and specialist member of the Central Bank, Mr. Jin Guobao, and he promised to publish his conversation as follows:</p>
<p>The Guarantor System is Unscientific</p>
<p>Bank employees are mostly in contact with coins and securities all day long due to their duties. In order to prevent embezzlement and fraud, banks must make them provide reliable guarantees. In the past, due to customs, those who acted as guarantors for employees were mostly people with considerable reputation in society. However, the number of such people is small, while the number of people seeking guarantors in society is extremely large. Therefore, each person with considerable reputation often acts as a guarantor for dozens or hundreds of people. The individual's financial resources are limited, and it is natural that the result of using limited financial resources to provide unlimited guarantees for a large number of people cannot be satisfactory. In recent years, banks have mostly used public examinations to recruit personnel in order to select true talents. The people who are admitted are not protected by power and influence, so it is not easy to obtain people with status to act as their guarantors. Therefore, they often have excellent knowledge but are ultimately rejected because they cannot obtain suitable guarantors.</p>
<p>Five Major Principles of Cash Guarantee</p>
<p>The above only lists the major points, which can already give a general idea. The individual guarantee method is not only a burden on employees and a mistake for the bank, but also unfavorable to the guarantor. It is urgent to reform it. However, although people in the banking industry have had such feelings in the past, there is no proper improvement, so they have not been able to resolve the above difficulties. In today's European and American countries, this system has long been eliminated. The credit insurance they practice is extremely expensive and not entirely applicable to the situation in our country. Recently, it has been heard that a large bank in this port initiated a special cash guarantee method. The content is to adopt the British and American banking system, refer to the situation in our country and formulate it. It is composed of five principles: A, B, and C guarantee deposits, joint punishment, and rewards for whistleblowing. It is stipulated that when an employee joins, they must pay an A guarantee deposit equal to three days' salary. (The item certificate is fully recovered when leaving the industry, and interest can still be obtained by storing it in the line. Afterwards, 2% of the B guarantee deposit is deducted from the salary or savings every month, and the line allocates a certain amount of the C guarantee deposit every year. Half of the interest on the A guarantee deposit (the interest is specially increased, so as to avoid the certificate being shelved), and the B and C guarantee deposits are combined into a huge amount as a public reserve fund, so as to compensate for the embezzlement of employees and the employee's certificate. When the money and all other property are not enough to compensate, make up for it with this. The nature of the B certificate deposit is similar to the premium for credit insurance, but it can still be returned if no fraud occurs. This is determined by the physical employee and the employee's personal relationship, and it has a more positive effect than paying the premium and not being able to return it. It is in insurance, the intention of saving is better than credit insurance, the above three items are focused on consolidating the compensation after the event. Preventing fraud is still not very effective, so it is stipulated that joint punishment and rewards for whistleblowing will curb the motivation for fraud. Later, there will be money for the employee welfare business from the huge amount of reserve funds, so as to help the progress of personnel management.</p>
<p>Group Combination to Prevent Problems Before They Happen</p>
<p>We can see that the above provisions have a close relationship, and the joint punishment and the return of the B guarantee deposit are especially meaningful. The entire method is meticulously planned, eliminating personal interest concepts, thinking from the interests of the entire group, in line with the spirit of modern group combination, and paying special attention to prevention in advance. In addition to the original mechanical supervision in handling affairs, it can also promote spiritual unity and cooperation to achieve the prevention of fraud. It can be asserted that it will have a great effect. It has been heard that this method has been proposed for more than two years, and it has been revised seven times. The original proposers have repeatedly consulted various opinions, researched and revised, and have reached perfection. After implementation, employees can be relieved of the difficulty of finding a guarantee. On the bank's side, if there is a fraud incident, there will be evidence to compensate, so it will not be as time-consuming and fruitless as in the past. It also makes ordinary guarantors no longer suffer from trouble in the future, which is beneficial to all parties. As for employees who have just joined the industry, it is not easy to raise the certificate money of three months' salary for those from poor families, but the amount is limited, which is much easier than asking someone to act as a guarantor. Therefore, cash guarantee is the only way to relieve employees' pain.</p>
<p>The Authorities Approve Implementation Within the Month</p>
<p>Since the method was proposed, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry has been quite supportive. Economic expert and Chairman of the Legislative Yuan, Dr. Ma Yinchu, has made a statement on this, believing it is feasible, and hoping that the banking authorities will pay attention to it. Recently, the Banking Association responded to the Banking Association's request for assistance and has repeatedly studied it and sent letters to the national financial community to jointly study the opinions expressed by all parties, which is very agreeable. It is also learned that Dr. Li Quanshi, the chief writer of the economic expert bank weekly, has written a "Questions and Answers" article to explain it in detail. This is enough to see the enthusiasm of all parties' support and the high expectations. It is now heard that the Banking Association is planning to implement the method after careful research in order to speed up the improvement of the guarantee system. Various banks will also follow suit. It is heard that one or two banks are about to implement it, which is a pioneer in the trend. This kind of reform and creative spirit is especially admired. It is seen that the difficulty of the guarantee problem felt by the banking industry for decades can be resolved. In the past, various undertakings in our country were mostly conservative and lacked creative spirit. It is heard that this method has been publicly studied by various leaders in the banking industry, and they all expressed their deep approval, which is enough to prove that the method is proper, perfect and undoubtedly different. It is seen that one line proposes it, and all lines follow suit. The future outlook is becoming brighter, which is not only a blessing for our banking industry, but also a blessing for the entire society.</p>
<h3>Sharp Drop in Yen Exchange Rate in Shanghai After Japanese Government Controls Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Japanese Businesses Try Their Best to Maintain It, But It Is Impossible to Stabilize for a While</p>
<p>Since the Japanese government controlled foreign exchange, yen exchange transactions in Shanghai suddenly became chaotic. Fortunately, Japanese commercial banks purchased a large amount of it to maintain it. Yesterday, the Central Bank quoted 103 yuan of Japanese gold as equivalent to 100 yuan of national currency, and the British HSBC Bank quoted 102 yuan and 62.5 cents of Japanese gold as equivalent to 100 yuan of national currency. However, according to investigations, the above quotation is not the actual market price. The actual transaction is 104 yuan and 50 cents of Japanese gold, which is equivalent to 100 yuan of national currency. It seems that it is not easy to stabilize for a while. However, it is heard that the Central Bank purchased 1-2 million yuan of Japanese gold last Saturday.</p>
<h3>British Businesses Exported a Total of 800 Quintals of Silkworm Cocoons</h3>
<p>Shipped to Britain, Italy, and France to Produce 85 High-Grade Raw Silk</p>
<p>After British companies such as Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. shipped high-quality dried cocoons from our country by ship to Italy, Britain, France, and other countries, the silk industry trade unions in various districts of Shanghai petitioned the government to quickly stop them in order to maintain the livelihood of workers. The silk factory industry association also asked the government to find ways to prevent it in order to avoid affecting the export of raw silk and maintaining the livelihood of tens of thousands of workers. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the relevant parties yesterday that the total amount of cocoons exported by Jardine Matheson and other foreign companies was about 800 quintals, which were shipped to various places in Britain, Italy, and France, and none were shipped to Japan. This high-quality dried cocoon is used to manufacture 13 to 15-line 85-point Ivenas high-grade raw silk. The price is about 950 yuan in Chinese currency per dan. Because our country's silk reeling machines are difficult to manufacture the above-mentioned raw silk.</p>

<p>After the Ministry of Finance announced that it would continue to levy various types of income tax from New Year's Day, the Shanghai Banking Industry Association has notified its members to comply. However, due to the complicated withholding procedures for deposit income tax, the joint meeting of the two industries decided to send Lin Kanghou and Cai Chengxin as representatives to contact the Shanghai Office of Income Tax of the Ministry of Finance for withholding procedures. According to the reporter's inquiry yesterday, Mr. Lin and Mr. Cai have reached an agreement with Mr. Liang Jingchun, Director of the Income Tax Office, on the amount of withholding for deposit interest income tax. The income withheld by banks and other institutions is 4% to be paid to the Ministry of Finance, and 1% is to be used as funds for the banks and other institutions.

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Opens Overseas Routes</h3>
<p>Haiyuan Steamer Sails on the Xiamen-Luzon Route</p>
<p>Since the Si Xin Steamer of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company opened the Nanhua route, its business has been good and its cargo and passengers have been crowded, surpassing the foreign merchant ships on the same route. In recent years, the overseas Chinese in various parts of Southeast Asia have requested the company to add overseas shipping routes to facilitate the travel of overseas Chinese. Letters and telegrams have been pouring in. Last year, the company decided to open new routes in Southeast Asia. At that time, General Manager Cai submitted it to the Ministry of Communications and immediately dispatched Zeng Guangqing, director of the business department of the bureau, to personally inspect various ports in Southeast Asia to prepare for adding new overseas routes. It was scheduled for February, and it was also planned to purchase several new sea ships suitable for sailing in Southeast Asia in Hong Kong and other places. The business department temporarily replaced An Laomian, and a notice has been issued, and the bureau members have also held a farewell party for Guangqing. Later, because the Ministry of Communications advocated building new ships and did not want to buy old ships again, the matter was shelved. Afterwards, the Southeast Asian Commercial Inspection Group returned to China, and in view of the overseas Chinese's ardent hope that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company would quickly open Southeast Asian routes to facilitate the travel of overseas Chinese and recover the overflowing rights and interests, the overseas Chinese in various places were willing to support it with all their strength. They provided opinions and conveyed them to the bureau, requesting immediate implementation. Because the bureau did not have many ships, it was temporarily difficult to open new routes to Singapore and other ports in Southeast Asia. However, in view of the large number of overseas Chinese in Little Luzon Port, and the fact that many overseas Chinese from Guangdong and Fujian were doing business in various parts of the Philippines, hundreds of thousands to millions of people travel there every year, all of whom board ships in Xiamen. The British Taikoo Company has the Anqing Steamer on this route, and Jardine Matheson also has a special route. The prosperity of the business and the crowding of passengers have made the most profit every year. Each ship carries more than a thousand overseas Chinese on each round trip, and the cargo is also crowded. After consideration, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company decided to open the route from Xiamen to Little Luzon first as a prelude to expanding overseas routes. The planning has been going on for many months, and the business department has been in contact with the Xiamen branch and various circles of overseas Chinese in Manila to carry out the project. A management office has been set up in Little Luzon to be responsible for soliciting passengers and receiving cargo. So far, it has been successful. The bureau has reported the preparation situation to the Ministry of Communications for instructions. A reply has now been received from the ministry, approving the opening of the route from Xiamen to Little Luzon first. However, due to the limited number of ships allocated, it was decided after discussion to assign the Haiyuan Steamer of the new Si Hai Steamers to sail on this newly created overseas route. The route starts from Xiamen and ends at Little Luzon, sailing back and forth. One ship is temporarily assigned to this route, which is mainly for passenger transport. The Haiyuan Steamer has 14 special-class rooms, 18 first-class rooms, 40 second-class rooms, 56 third-class rooms with berths, and 600 third-class rooms without berths. The steerage (that is, fourth-class passenger seats) can accommodate hundreds of people. The ship is new, fast, and suitable for sailing on this new overseas route. Because it has been approved by the ministry, it has been preparing for the opening procedures for days and is very active in preparing. It will probably be officially opened on February 1st. If it is temporarily impossible, it will be delayed for a few days, but it will be opened within a month at the latest. This is indeed a good phenomenon in our country's shipping industry, and it is also good news for the overseas Chinese in Manila.</p>
<h3>Crowds Visit the Municipal Museum</h3>
<p>Open Every Day Except Tuesdays. Items Will Be Replaced Within a Short Period of Time</p>
<p>The grand opening of the Shanghai Municipal Museum the day before yesterday has been recorded in previous newspapers. Yesterday, Chinese and foreign people continued to visit in an endless stream, and it was especially crowded in the afternoon. Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs accompanied his wife and Director Li of the First Department of the Municipal Government to visit. Most of the visitors concentrated and studied carefully, and were unwilling to just take a quick look. The exhibits in the museum are mostly of historical significance or artistic beauty, which aroused the interest of the audience. It is heard that after the news of the scheduled opening of the museum was announced, major middle schools and various associations sent letters to order group tickets. Primary schools also have Municipal Xicheng and private Minfu and Jun'an schools that went to ask for permission certificates. The museum has scheduled the visiting dates to avoid crowding. Many cultural institutions in various places also sent telegrams to congratulate them. It is heard that in order to arouse the interest of the audience, the museum plans to replace the exhibits within a short period of time and hold special exhibitions. Also, the museum stops selling tickets at 4 pm every day, so visitors who go to visit in the afternoon must arrive at the museum before 4 pm at the latest to avoid traveling long distances in vain. Tuesdays every month are the museum's regular holidays, so it is closed today. It is open every other day of the year.</p>
<h3>Dredging Bureau Adds Newly Built Dredger with Imposing Hull, Unrivaled in the World</h3>
<p>With a hull length reaching 400 feet, British, German, and Dutch ship merchants compete to submit bids, and dredging of the Shintang sandbar proceeds extremely smoothly.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dredging Bureau, in order to dredge the Shintang sandbar outside the Wusongkou, ordered a giant dredger named "Jianshe" from the German company, Denggao, which arrived in Shanghai in April of the year before last and began the dredging project. Details have been previously reported. Yesterday, the reporter visited the bureau's chief engineer, Dr. Chadley, who provided detailed information about the ordering of the new ship and the recent progress of the dredging work. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Shintang Dredging Proceeds Exceptionally Smoothly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter visited the bureau's chief engineer, Chadley, to inquire about the recent dredging of Shintang. According to Chadley, the dredging project of Shintang began in May of the year before last, after the giant dredger "Jianshe" arrived in Shanghai from Germany. As of now, 7 million cubic yards of mud have been dredged. According to the original plan, "Jianshe" can dredge approximately 5 million cubic yards of mud per year at Shintang. The actual amount has exceeded the aforementioned quantity, so the progress of the project can be considered smooth.</p>
<p>Seven Foreign Merchants Bid for the New Ship</p>
<p>The reporter further inquired whether the contractor for the second large dredger had been determined since the invitation for bids was announced. According to Chadley, since the invitation for bids for the first large dredger was announced last year, seven bids have been received, including three from British merchants, two from Dutch ship merchants, and two from German ship merchants. However, which company will be the contractor has not yet been determined. However, the German Xue Gao Company (i.e., the contractor for the previous "Jianshe") is considered to have a higher chance.</p>
<p>Imposing Ship Type Exceeds "Jianshe"</p>
<p>The reporter further asked Chadley whether the new ship's construction plan and its work efficiency would be greater and higher than that of "Jianshe". According to his reply, the length of the new ship exceeds that of "Jianshe" by 40 feet (the length of "Jianshe" is 360 feet), and the width exceeds that of "Jianshe" by 2.5 feet (the width of "Jianshe" is 60 feet). The amount of mud dredged per hour is similar to that of "Jianshe", approximately 2,500 cubic yards, but the mud suction power is even greater than that of "Jianshe".</p>
<p>Dredging Efficiency Surpasses the World</p>
<p>The reporter asked Chadley whether the new ship's design even surpasses that of the "Jianshe", which was already known as the world's largest dredger when it was built in Germany, and whether it is indeed enough to be the best in the world. Chadley replied that there are two dredgers in the world that are longer than "Jianshe", and one that is about the same length as "Jianshe". As for the new ship under construction, there is also one that is longer, which is used by the British for sand suction work in Liverpool, and its length reaches 460 feet. However, its ship type and mechanism are old-fashioned, and its suction power is far less than that of the new ship specially built by our bureau. Therefore, in terms of dredging power, it can indeed hold the crown of the world's dredgers.</p>
<h3>Rent Arrears Case: Lawyer Falsely Accused</h3>
<p>Zhang Jinrong, a native of Huaicheng, Jiangbei, residing at No. 29 Gonghe Road, Zhabei, owed the landlord, Shengsheng Company, 346 yuan in rent. Shengsheng Company entrusted its annual legal counsel, Lawyer Xuan Zhendong, to sue for recovery. After the final judgment, Zhang instructed Chen Jianqiu to request monthly payments from Lawyer Xuan. Lawyer Xuan refused, so he requested the execution court of the local court to execute the judgment. Zhang Jinrong then accused Xuan Zhendong at the Procuratorate of the local court of inviting Chen Jianqiu to his law firm, persuading him to pay 30 yuan to settle the case and guaranteeing that it would not be executed and that there was no need to appeal. He believed this to be true and paid 30 yuan on the afternoon of September 27. Unexpectedly, on the morning of December 8, at 9:00 AM, the execution court executed the judgment for payment. Therefore, Lawyer Xuan was accused of promising money and breaking his promise. Yesterday, Prosecutor Tang summoned a court hearing. Xuan Zhendong declared that he was completely framed. After studying the situation, the interrogator pointed out that ㊀ how could 30 yuan settle a rent debt of 300 yuan, and ㊁ lawsuits involving less than 500 yuan cannot be appealed in the third instance. There was no reason for Xuan Zhendong to deceive him that there was no need to appeal and to request reconciliation. Moreover, there was no evidence to support the accusation. It was obvious that Zhang Jinrong was fabricating facts out of resentment for being sued. He was immediately denounced in court, and the plaintiff, Zhang Jinrong, was transformed into a defendant. He was ordered to be detained for further interrogation after posting bail.</p>
<h3>Capsized Civilian Ship Outside Wusongkou</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various shipping companies received a notice from the Jianghai Customs Marine Police, stating that a capsized civilian ship outside Wusongkou was obstructing navigation and ordering them to pay attention. The notice stated that they had received a wireless report from the Nanchang steamer at 4:00 PM on the 9th of this month, stating that they had seen a capsized civilian ship obstructing navigation at 123 degrees east longitude and 33 degrees 36 minutes north latitude.</p>
<h3>Hydrographic Office Plans to Enhance Navigation Safety</h3>
<p>Navigators Discover Obstacles and Damaged Markers, Hoping for Prompt Notification or Wireless Transmission</p>
<p>The Shanghai Hydrographic Office issued its first proclamation of the year yesterday, which is extremely important. It is recorded below. Regarding the proclamation, the bureau handles hydrographic surveys and publishes all important events related to navigation. All published charts and books are compiled based on the latest surveys and reports. However, the rivers and waterways are constantly changing, and shipwrecks occur from time to time. In order to enhance navigation safety, it is hoped that navigators will notify the bureau of any events that require correction of the published hydrographic charts and books. In particular, it is hoped that they will promptly notify the bureau of any newly discovered navigation obstacles and changes or damages to navigation markers, so that navigation announcements can be published to inform the public. If there is an urgent message that needs to be transmitted to the bureau by wireless, it can be transmitted through the following two radio stations. This proclamation is hereby issued. The stations are: Shanghai Coast Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications, "Location" 121 degrees 27 minutes 41 seconds east longitude, 31 degrees 13 minutes 10 seconds north latitude, "Call Sign" XSC, "Wavelength" 750 meters (400 kHz), 705 meters (425.5 kHz), 650 meters (461.5 kHz), 630 meters (476.1 kHz), 605 meters (495.8 kHz), 600 meters (500 kHz), 48 meters (6250 kHz), 36 meters (8333.3 kHz).

Hydrographic Office of the Naval Department, Republic of China, January 1937.</p>
<h3>Three Organizations Deny Holding Meetings in Borrowed Rooms</h3>
<p>Shen Junru and Others Claim to Have Held Meetings in Shanghai; Jiangsu High Court Sends Letter to Second Branch of High Court for Investigation</p>
<p>Shen Junru, Li Gongpu, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Taofen, Wang Zaoshi, Sha Qianli, and female lawyer Shi Liang, among other seven people, were arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau in conjunction with the British and French Concession police for suspected reactionary activities, and have been sent to the Procuratorate of the Suzhou High Court for investigation. It is learned that the Procuratorate of the Suzhou High Court stated that, according to Shen and others, on November 12th of last year, the birthday of the Premier, meetings were held in Shanghai at the Youth Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, and the Ningbo Native Place Association. Therefore, a letter was sent to the Second Branch of the High Court, requesting an investigation into whether the statements made by Shen and others were true. The Second Branch of the High Court summoned Xu Yi, Zhang Zhixue, and Dong Qinxiang, the managers of the three associations, to court on Saturday morning. Judge Nie presided over the interrogation. According to Xu Yi, the Youth Association has never had an auditorium, and no one held a meeting there that day. All the rooms in the association were already occupied by residents. If a small number of people held a small group meeting in the room, the manager would not be able to know. According to Zhang Zhixue, he had previously received a letter from Shen Junru, requesting to borrow the auditorium of the Young Women's Christian Association for a meeting on November 12th. He contacted the Public Works Department to inquire, and the request was rejected because it was not approved by the Public Works Department. However, when the date arrived, a crowd gathered. Because the association did not allow the auditorium to be borrowed, they gathered in the open square. It happened to be a holiday that day, and only Western staff members were present in the association. They did not recognize whether Shen Junru and others were among the crowd, and the crowd dispersed soon after. According to Dong Qinxiang, he received a phone call at the Ningbo Native Place Association that day, inquiring whether there was a meeting. He glanced out the window and saw many people gathered on the road. Because the area was always bustling, there were many passersby, so he did not pay attention. At this time, a detective from the police station came to Yu to investigate and was told that there was no meeting. The detective ordered him to prepare a sign stating that there was no meeting and place it at the entrance. The crowd gathered on the road gradually dispersed. After the interrogation, Judge Nie ordered Xu, Zhang, and Dong to leave, and sent a letter to the Jiangsu High Court to report the results of the investigation.</p>
<h3>Russian Prisoner Attempts to Escape; Detained for Investigation</h3>
<p>A certain Russian prisoner in the Jiangsu-Shanghai Second Special District Prison on Route de Say 南路, French Concession, had a conflict and quarrel over the issue of bread at around 10:00 AM yesterday. After being stopped by the guards, the prisoner not only refused to obey but also went out of the prison gate in an attempt to escape. The prisoner was caught by the prison guards and security personnel. After being questioned by the head of the responsible section, the warden ordered a written report to be prepared and the prisoner to be transferred to the French Police Department for investigation.</p>
<h3>British Employee of Western Prison Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>No. 76 Aierkao克 Road is divided into two parts: one is the Western Prison, where criminals are imprisoned, and the other is a dormitory, where Western employees who manage the prison live. At around 10:30 PM last night, a gunshot suddenly rang out in the dormitory. At that time, all the employees followed the sound to investigate and saw an American employee, Fei 斐氏, lying on the ground, with blood and brain matter splattered all over the floor. A pistol and a shell casing were left next to him. The police station was immediately notified, and an ambulance was called. Fei was rushed to Gongji Public Hospital for treatment, but he died on the way due to the severity of his injuries. The body has been transferred to the coroner's office to await a report to the British Coroner's Office for examination. The cause of his suicide is currently being investigated. It is learned that the deceased was only 29 years old.</p>
<h3>Shen Zhongyi, Deputy Manager of China Merchants Bureau, Assumes Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>After Tan Boying, the deputy manager of the state-owned China Merchants Bureau, resigned from his various positions, the Ministry of Communications appointed Shen Zhongyi, chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association and general manager of Hongan Company, to the position. The appointment order was sent from Beijing to Shanghai on Sunday afternoon. Shen arrived at Zhou Luxin 周履新's office at 8:30 AM yesterday. Cai Zengji and Lao Mian, along with the section chiefs and deputy chiefs of the bureau, welcomed him to the deputy manager's office for a brief rest before holding a memorial week lecture for all the bureau staff in the auditorium. Cai Zengji and Shen entered the auditorium together. Cai introduced Shen, saying that Deputy Manager Shen had served as the chief of the business section, the Shanghai branch manager, and the Hankou branch manager of the bureau. He was very familiar with the situation of the bureau. He was deeply grateful that the bureau had found the right person to serve as deputy manager. Shen then gave a speech, saying that he had worked in the bureau for many years, but the situation may be slightly different since the reorganization. He was deeply willing to work with his colleagues in the bureau, based on past efforts, under the leadership of General Manager Cai, to jointly promote progress. He then announced his assumption of office. The meeting ended at 9:30 AM. Shen went to the deputy manager's office to review official documents. All the shipping companies and customs brokers in Shanghai, as well as bankers, sent representatives to the bureau to congratulate Shen. Shen met them one by one and did not leave until after a long time. Deputy Manager Shen then took over the seals, stamps, and documents handed over by his predecessor and began working in the afternoon. Regarding his original position as general manager of Hongan Company, because Minister Yu Feipeng and Yu Qiaqing had discussed and agreed in advance, Shen handled the handover of matters handled by Hongan Company after taking office as the new deputy manager of China Merchants Bureau in order to complete the transition. This time, Shen was honored to be appointed as the deputy manager of China Merchants Bureau because Minister Yu believed that Shen was very familiar with private shipping companies, and the shipping industry could use this opportunity to realize the ministry's advocacy of making state-owned and private shipping industries move towards a unified front and achieve the goal of cooperation, which was the first step in developing the shipping industry externally. Therefore, the merchants were also happy that Shen took office at China Merchants Bureau. From then on, China's entire shipping industry could gradually develop. Whether they knew Shen or not, everyone deeply rejoiced that China Merchants Bureau had found the right person for this new position.</p>

<h3>One Hundred and Twenty Yuan Can Become Twelve Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>It Turns Out to Be a Bag of Waste Paper; Yuan Yongfu Tricks a Child</p>
<p>Yuan Yongfu, a native of Ningbo, 31 years old, has been setting up a fortune-telling stall at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Ningbo Road, specializing in using flowery words to swindle people's money. Li Minghua, a young owner of Huaming Watch Shop at No. 589 Zhejiang Road, a native of Ningbo (15 years old, residing at No. 140 Xiamen Road, who used to study at Jinwei Primary School nearby and had to pass by Yuan's stall every day), saw that Yuan was always performing various magical arts and felt very curious. He approached him. Yuan learned that Li's family was well-off and used clever words to say that he had a kind of magic that could double each yuan of legal tender into one hundred yuan. Li was moved by his words and took 120 yuan of legal tender from the crowd and gave it to Yuan. Yuan then put it into a yellow cloth bag and took another yellow bag with a statue of a deity, instructing Li to hold it in his left and right hands and ordering him to close his eyes tightly. Li did as he was told. Yuan then took out a package of powder and ordered Li to smell it. He only felt a strange smell, and the child felt slightly dizzy. Then he woke up. Yuan then ordered the child to go home quickly, saying that the 120 yuan of legal tender in the bag had turned into 12,000 yuan, but he insisted that he must not open it halfway, otherwise he would be punished by the gods. Li believed it to be true and rushed home to open the bag, only to find that the legal tender stored in the bag had all turned into waste paper. He knew that he had been cheated and told his mother, Li Bao, who reported it to the Zhabei Police Station. Detective Wang Shanshi was ordered to arrest the suspect, Yuan, but he had already fled. It was not until recently that he was arrested at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Baike Road. Yuan was dressed in neat clothes. He was taken back to the police station. It was learned that after Yuan defrauded the 120 yuan, most of the stolen money was taken away by a famous Little Hubei. The money he obtained was used to buy clothes, watches, and other items. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Jingyi Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted him for fraud under Article 340 of the Criminal Law. Yuan Yongfu pleaded guilty, saying that when the plaintiff closed his eyes, he immediately replaced the bag (i.e., the one with waste paper) with the bag containing the legal tender. After verifying the confession, Judge Feng Shide sentenced Yuan Yongfu to 10 months in prison. The clothes and other items purchased with the stolen money were returned to the plaintiff.</p>

<p>Strictly Punish Any Violations</p>
<p>The New Life Movement Promotion Association in this city, in order to implement the crackdown on extra tips, convened a joint meeting of relevant agencies and groups on November 21 of last year. At the time, it was decided that ㊀ workers in all industries should determine their wages.

The distribution method should be negotiated and determined by both labor and management sides. ㊂ In the future, large sums of security deposits should be replaced with shop guarantees. If there are special circumstances that require cash to be collected, they should be deposited in a reliable bank and given interest as usual. ㊃ Workers are absolutely not allowed to solicit tips from customers in the future. The above measures were also decided to be implemented from the New Year's Day of the 26th year of the Republic of China. The reporter of Da Gong She yesterday met Jiang Hao, the secretary of the New Life Movement Association.

<h3>Carrying Handguns and Handcuffs, Impersonating Detectives for Extortion</h3>
<p>Chen Xize, a Shandong native residing at 52 Chashi Street, French Concession, fled to Vladivostok after being suspected of drug trafficking. Now that the situation has calmed down, he returned to Shanghai a month ago. A Hebei native, Mr. Sun, who had previously worked as a bodyguard for a certain celebrity, learned of this and colluded with Wang Qigui, a Jiangbei native who was a secret agent number 618 at the Mailan Police Station, and Ling Changsheng, a Tianjin native who had been dismissed as a Chinese constable. On the night of the 2nd of this month, they wore Zhongshan suits, carried handguns and handcuffs, and fake documents, etc., impersonating detectives. They went to Chen Xize's house and extorted money on the pretext of searching for drugs. Chen happened to be out, and only Chen's wife was at home. Wang and Ling entered the room and saw Chen's wife lying on a couch, indulging in opium. They arrested Chen's wife and used extortion tactics. As a result, the landlord surnamed Wang repeatedly pleaded for leniency, and they agreed to settle the matter for 100 yuan. They paid 20 yuan in cash at the time, and the remaining 80 yuan was scheduled to be paid the next day. Wang and Ling pretended to agree to release Chen's wife, received the money, and left. Later, Chen returned home and learned of the incident. He had to wait until the next day when they came to collect the money and report it to the police station. When Wang and Ling arrived on time to collect the money, they saw that Chen Xize looked ominous and immediately turned around and fled. Chen also chased them to the entrance of Chashi Street, where the patrol officer at post number 89 intercepted Wang and Ling. Sun took the opportunity to escape. Wang and Ling were taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Peng from the First Criminal Court questioned them. Attorney Gu Shouxi of the Police Department explained the case and prosecuted the two defendants for the crime of intimidation. The plaintiff Chen also explained the process of the defendants' intimidation. Wang and Ling admitted that they had gone to collect the usual 20 yuan from the plaintiff because he was engaged in the drug trafficking business. After verifying the confessions in court, the court declared the proceedings concluded and scheduled the sentence for the 16th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Water Patrol Team Recovers Robbed Cargo Ship</h3>
<p>Loot Untouched</p>
<p>Sun Shaokang, a native of Sijing, owns cargo ship No. 3563, which has a municipal license and specializes in transporting goods from the interior to Shanghai for delivery to various merchants. He hired three fellow villagers, Mao Zirong, Zhou Aji, and Yang Gensheng, as crew members. On the 9th of this month, they loaded 30 bundles of white rice and 130 baskets of duck eggs in Sijing and transported them to Shanghai, which were goods of Xie Ji Run and Yixing Gong merchants in Caishi Street, French Concession. Unexpectedly, at 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the ship arrived at the dock of the Tiansheng Pottery Factory behind the Longhua Port. While resting, a large number of bandits, more than ten, suddenly came and crowded onto the ship. They all held knives and guns and spoke in the Jiangbei dialect, threatening them not to make a sound. They tied up all the crew members with ropes, stuffed cotton in their mouths, and carried them onto a boat that the bandits had prepared in advance. They then robbed the cargo ship and sailed away. After the crew members managed to untie themselves, they urgently reported to Kong Zhaorong, the captain of the Third Squadron of the Water Patrol Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau, for investigation and arrest. They reported to Wei Jizhong, the chief of the brigade, who dispatched Inspector Pan Xutong and Police Chief Liu Xianzhang to drive patrol boats and search diligently in different directions. As a result, at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the water patrol officers and police discovered the robbed cargo ship in the Dinghai Port area of the Yangshupu fish market. All the rice and eggs were untouched. It is thought that the bandits must have gone ashore to contact people for selling the stolen goods. The ship was towed back to the team, and the shipowner was notified to come and claim it. A report was also submitted to the Police Headquarters to issue an order to arrest the fleeing bandits and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Mother and Daughter Poisoned by Coal Stove for Heating</h3>

Kongshi and her daughter Guiying (8 years old) live in the loft of the house. Last night, when they went to bed, they put a coal ball stove in front of the bed for heating because the weather was cold. At around 8:00 AM this morning, the second landlord of the house saw that Kongshi and her daughter had not yet gotten up and became suspicious. He knocked on their door, but there was no response. He then asked someone to pry open the door and saw Kongshi and her daughter lying in bed, barely breathing. A coal stove was placed in front of the bed. Knowing that they had been poisoned, he quickly carried Kongshi and her daughter to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the poisoning was very serious, and their lives are in danger.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Announces Replacement of South Wharf Contractor</h3>
<p>Regarding the replacement of the South Wharf carrying contractor, the state-owned China Merchants Bureau issued a statement yesterday, stating that the Bureau's dispatching of carrying labor system is one aspect of rectifying wharf affairs. Therefore, in August of last year, the carrying labor for each wharf was publicly tendered to seek fundamental reform. When the South Wharf carrying labor tender results were announced, Li Huanxin was selected as the winning bidder. A contract was immediately signed and handed over for undertaking, hoping that Li Huanxin could fulfill the contract terms, so that the loading and unloading matters of the wharf could gradually become perfect. Unexpectedly, after Li took over, there were frequent incidents of deducting workers' wages and demanding money from merchants. The Bureau has received multiple reports from various responsible parties and complaints. Moreover, Li Huanxin's ability is weak, and he is not good at managing loading and unloading, and the efficiency rate has been sharply reduced compared to before. What could be unloaded in ten hours had to be extended to more than twenty hours before it could be unloaded. Furthermore, goods that should have been loaded and unloaded during the day were delayed until the evening to begin loading and unloading. The Bureau's ship schedules were often delayed, and even the schedule was often adjusted in advance to accommodate this. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, the direct and indirect losses suffered by the Bureau are incalculable. The Bureau initially gave Li leniency because he had not been in charge for long and only issued broad warnings. However, as the situation became more and more serious, the Wharf Management Office was ordered to rectify it within a limited time. Unexpectedly, while the deadline was in progress, the loading and unloading of the Taishun Wheel was delayed again. The wheel arrived at the Jinliyuan Wharf at 8:00 AM on November 10th and berthed to unload cargo. Statistics showed that there were more than 9,000 packages of salt and a total of more than 12,000 pieces of sundry goods. According to past practice, it would only take about ten hours to unload all of them. Moreover, the dock was not crowded that day, and the goods could have been unloaded that evening as usual. However, the next morning, the ship reported that there were still 1,500 pieces that had not been unloaded. The Bureau had no choice but to revoke Li's contract rights. This is a rough outline of the case. Article 7 of the South Wharf carrying labor contract states that "Party B (the contractor) must prepare sufficient and capable carrying workers to provide services at the wharf of this wharf. If the work is suspended or delayed due to insufficient carrying workers, lack of ability, strikes, riots, or labor disputes, or due to Party B's errors, Party B shall be responsible for compensating all losses incurred as a result. Regardless of whether the compensation is paid to the shipping company or to the persons concerned, Party B shall not use unloading as an excuse." Article 16 states that "If Party B has any of the following circumstances, Party A may revoke its contract rights at any time, terminate the contract immediately, and may also confiscate all or part of its guarantee deposit." Clause A of the same article states that "If there is a situation in Article 7 or Article 8 and repeated warnings are not heeded." According to Li Huanxin's taking over, the fault of violating Article 7 of the contract has long been established due to the insufficient number of carrying workers or lack of ability, which has resulted in repeated delays in the ship schedule. The delay of Taishun is only a manifestation of not obeying the warning within the warning period. Since Li Huanxin violated the contract and did not obey the warning, the Bureau had no choice but to revoke his contract rights in accordance with Clause A of Article 16 of the contract. As for the losses suffered by the Bureau in its business during Li Huanxin's contract period, the relevant personnel are now conducting a thorough investigation. Once the exact amount is determined, Li Huanxin will be ordered to compensate the full amount to protect public funds. If Li Huanxin does not agree with the Bureau's revocation of the contract, he should seek a solution through proper channels. If he refuses to hand over, the Bureau has decided to enforce it forcibly.</p>

<h3>Kuang Xiaosong Establishes Gold and Stone Connections</h3>

<p>The Special Effects of Ailan Bally Milk Powder: Generally, nursing mothers often lack milk after childbirth due to insufficient nutrition or physical weakness, resulting in weak babies. At this time, it is appropriate to choose a reliable milk powder. Ailan Bally Milk Powder is divided into three types, which can be used to feed infants according to their needs, suitable for infant nutrition needs and digestive capacity, and is equal to healthy breast milk. Recently, a British woman gave birth after only six and a half months of pregnancy, resulting in the baby weighing only one pound. The nursing mother was also weak and stayed in the hospital for treatment. Initially, she was fed Grade A fresh milk, but the baby's development was slow and had green stools. The parents thought there was no hope of survival. After switching to Ailan Bally Milk Powder, not only did the green stools stop, but the weight had increased to seven pounds and thirteen ounces in four months. It can be seen that Ailan Bally Milk Powder is indeed the most reliable product for raising babies.</p>

<h3>Qinghua 10th Anniversary Speech</h3>
<p>— Wang Yiting</p>
<p>Qinghua Elementary and Middle School was founded in the year of Dingmao. Located on Tongfu Road, it has been ten years since. Initially, there were only twenty students. Later, the number of students gradually increased, and the school could not accommodate them. So it moved to Meibaige Road. The school building has been expanded. After many years, there was a plan to rebuild the house, so it moved to Dingxing Road. The number of students increased greatly, and the school could not accommodate them. So it moved to Baike Road, which is now the school building. The school has moved three times. The construction and management during this period have resulted in this scale. If you don't have enthusiasm, how can you achieve this? The founder is Mr. Feng Shuhua from Tongxiang. His morality is pure and his knowledge is profound. I know him well. Mr. Feng has been serving the society for more than a day. Who can't say it? Why wait for me to add it? However, regarding Mr. Feng's school management, I would like to tell everyone that Mr. Feng regards students as his own children and teaches them earnestly again and again. I don't know the credit. As for the curriculum, it adapts to the trend to expand its use. It also makes students study scriptures to plant its foundation. I have heard that the students' parents and brothers welcome it and send their children to study. The number is increasing day by day. Now, a commemorative publication is printed. Everything about the inside story and the flourishing achievements can be seen in this. After the special publication was completed, Mr. Feng urged me to write the preface. So I described it. In the mid-winter month of Bingzi. Wu Xing Wang Zhen</p>

<h3>Review and Prospects of This School</h3>
<p>The Evolution of This School</p>
<p>Qinghua Elementary and Middle School was established to commemorate Mr. Feng Huimin and Mrs. Feng Huiyi. It began in the spring of the 16th year. The location was on Tongfu Road in Shanghai. At that time, there were only more than 20 students. The following year, the number of students increased. In the spring of the 18th year, the school building was not enough, so it moved to a large Western-style house on Meibaige Road, and the number of students increased even more. In the 23rd year, it moved to Dingxing Road again. Since then, the number of students has increased sharply, and the school building is not enough, so it moved to a four-story Western-style house at No. 428 Baike Road, which is now the school building. The school has moved three times so far, and the number of students has increased to more than 300. The scale has been greatly expanded. The expansion of the library, the addition of the physics and chemistry room, the martial arts hall, the ping pong room, the basketball court, the volleyball court, the badminton court, the recreation room, the children's playground, and the children's court are all available.</p>

<p>Qinghua Elementary and Middle School 10th Anniversary</p>
<p>Cai Sen Jiao Pu Pan Zhichen Title</p>
<p>The Honors of This School</p>
<p>The graduates of this school have all been admitted to famous high schools in China. Others, such as those who were admitted to the Shanghai Bank of China, the Telephone Bureau, the Postal Administration, and the Taxation Specialist Graduation School, and who have jobs, are looking forward to each other.

This school's Boy Scouts participated in the Third National Review of Chinese Boy Scouts and the Seventh Grand Jamboree, and won the "Well-Trained" award and medal. The Ministry of Internal Affairs organized the five-province health book competition of the Department of Health, which was listed as the best grade and won a certificate and prizes.</p>
<p>The Planned Plans of This School</p>
<p>Although the school building of this school has been relocated to a better place many times. However, it is not easy to find a spacious and suitable place for each relocation. I don’t know how much effort it took to find it. It is now planned to raise funds, and when the number is reached, a base will be purchased to build a school building.</p>
<p>The current school system of this school is only for junior high school. It is still inconvenient for students to graduate and not be able to continue their studies in this school. It is planned to add a high school department to facilitate the opening of schools for junior high school graduates.</p>
<p>Although the books and equipment of this school have been purchased as much as possible. However, books and equipment are related to the imparting of students' knowledge. More equipment means more knowledge. Therefore, it is still planned to actively enrich it.</p>
<p>Although this school has tried its best to improve the teaching of students, the road of learning is endless. It is still planned to improve the teaching so that the students' level can be further improved.</p>
<p>This school is supported by Shuhua alone, and I dare not say that I am tired. I still rely on the gentlemen of the country to correct me. I hope that it will expand day by day, and the school will be fortunate. Feng Huashu respectfully stated</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education's Radio Program Today</h3>
<p>Topic: The Importance of Mental Hygiene</p>

<p>Time: 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM</p>
<p>Frequency: 660</p>

<h3>Wang Yukai's Radio Lecture on Civic Training Issues</h3>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Today I want to discuss with you the issue of civic training. Before I get to the main topic, let me share two simple stories.</p>
<p>(1) One day, a university professor was walking in the countryside when he encountered a shepherd. He asked him this question: "Our 'Three Eastern Provinces' have been seized by the Japanese, do you know about it?" The shepherd thought for a long time, seemingly aware of the situation, and said, "Oh, is it that the 'pig's head offerings' for sacrifices are missing? My family hasn't had a sacrifice these past few days, so I don't need pig's head offerings. What does it have to do with me if the Japanese seize the pig's head offerings from other people's families?"</p>
<p>(2) I remember last year when I returned from the United States, passing through Japan, I chatted with several Chinese students. We were all speaking to each other in different dialects from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Liaoning, and Jilin provinces. One student from the Northeast said, "Why is your country's language the same as our country's (referring to Manchukuo)?"</p>
<p>These two stories can evoke endless emotions in us. The former demonstrates the "ignorance" of the general Chinese populace, who are unaware of the concept of a nation-state. The latter exposes the mentality of young people in the Northeast today, who are gradually moving towards enslavement. The general intellectual class has largely lost its national concept and ethnic consciousness, so they are unaware that they are recognizing a thief as their father. Seeing this situation, we can understand that civic training is a matter of extreme urgency.</p>
<p>After the citizens of a country undergo adequate training, they can develop a national character. Everyone knows that the spirit of a country is entrusted to the people of the entire nation, and the quality of the national character can determine whether a country's future can develop. Therefore, governments around the world attach great importance to the cultivation of national character, which in other words, is an extraordinary emphasis on the issue of civic training. I will now briefly describe the characteristics of civic training in Japan and the United States, and then talk about the work that Chinese public education should do in this extraordinary period and its proper attitude. First, let's talk about the United States. There are several characteristics of American citizens that are worth emulating:</p>
<p>First, respect for labor—China has the saying "Labor is sacred," which is actually borrowed from the United States. The son of U.S. President Roosevelt is farming in the countryside. Some people suspect him and ask why he doesn't go to the White House to live the life of a "crown prince" or "heir apparent." He himself says that he is also a citizen and should earn his own living. The president has an annual salary of $75,000, but his wife still drives her own car. In addition to studying, college students often look for work, such as wiping windows, mopping floors, washing dishes in restaurants, and washing clothes for others. Everywhere you can see their good habits of respecting labor and advocating independent living.</p>
<p>Second, full of vigor—American citizens are very energetic, regardless of gender or age. Although they are older, their physique and spirit are still very strong, maintaining the vigorous spirit of their youth everywhere. When I was in the United States, two of my classmates were very old. One was a 60-year-old female classmate who earned a doctoral degree, and the other was P. of. Johnson, a 64-year-old professor at Hujiang University, who returned to the United States to continue his studies. Most of the students in our class were older. At first, I thought they were all professors, so I always stood up to pay my respects when they came to class. It was only later that I learned that they were all students. This kind of spirit of diligent learning is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Third, having a great and magnificent spirit—In China, building the Yellow River Railway Bridge and the Qiantang River Railway Bridge is considered a very difficult and great undertaking, but in the United States, building the San Francisco Pacific Railway Bridge and completing the Sino-American voyage are several times greater. The 22-story-high Shanghai International Hotel is considered remarkable in China, but it is very common in New York, with the highest being 102 stories. Some people think that if people on Earth want to communicate with people on Mars, they must be shot over with a cannon. As a result, many people signed up to participate. This shows the American habit of being full of the ambition to dominate the world. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Swap Transactions of Unified Bonds are Relatively Active</p>
<p>Only 5,000 Transactions for Fuxing</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market on the Chinese Securities Exchange was still quiet, and transactions were still sluggish. Market sentiment was increasingly stagnant as the environment became more chaotic. Major players on both sides remained firm, and retail investors were cautious about entering and exiting the market. The supply and demand of chips on the counter was still relatively balanced, but swap transactions were more active, and market prices slightly increased. However, the sluggish situation is not easy to break. At the opening price yesterday morning, due to the uncertainty caused by the Shaanxi Incident, many retail investors sold, and market prices generally decreased by 10 to 25 cents. The second round showed a strong upward trend, with No. 77 buying actively, and Class Ding and Class Jia all increasing by 10 to 25 cents. The current Class Wu was down by a small amount of 5 cents.

<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Sugar Transactions are Smooth and Active</p>
<p>Prices Rise Across the Board, Goods are Available</p>
<p>The sugar market yesterday saw prices rise continuously in the producing areas, and with strong sales, market sentiment became even more enthusiastic. The guild's exchange prices were: 24 coarse granulated sugar, 22.3 yuan, transshipment cargo 7 yuan, up 10 to 20 cents from Saturday; No. 4 Dongbai, 22.3 yuan, transshipment 7.3 yuan; No. 8, 22.1 yuan, transshipment 7 yuan; YRO, 21.75 yuan, transshipment 6.8 yuan, all up 20 to 30 cents.

<h3>Yarn Flower</h3>
<p>Third Grade Dramatically Rises to Limit Price; Urgent Need to Cover Short Positions in Yarn Flower</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Rises Around Three Yuan; Standard Flower Also Jumps Six or Seven Jiao</p>
<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning but rose in the afternoon, with the momentum turning sharply upward. This was mainly due to the dramatic rise in Osaka's third-grade yarn. The Shanghai market was affected, and rumors spread in the afternoon that third-grade yarn had exceeded 300 yuan, leading to short-covering activities and pushing the market higher step by step. However, the current yarn business is slow, and 10-count yarn lacks sales channels. A telegram from Osaka stated that the morning session was originally scheduled to open at 1:10 PM, but the afternoon session was suspended and did not open.</p>
<p>Indian merchants exclusively bid on February standard yarn for future delivery. All months rose uniformly, as Osaka's third-grade yarn rebounded by eight, nine, or ten yuan, boosting market sentiment and triggering short covering, leading to another price surge. However, after the second session, it was heard that current yarn sales were slow, and the current yarn market was mediocre. It was also said that the Japanese exchange rate on the black market increased significantly, so new buyers still lacked interest. Only Jinchang exclusively bid on the February contract on the 22nd, reportedly purchasing on behalf of Indian merchants. However, factories heavily hedged by selling 10-count coarse yarn. As a result, standard yarn for all months rose by 2.7 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The market situation at the afternoon opening was slightly firm, as the closing price of third-grade yarn in the previous session had not arrived, and rumors were rampant, leading to a rise in distant months. However, some said the Japanese exchange rate might change, and current yarn transactions were not active. By the close, it was heard that Osaka's third-grade yarn had suspended trading, and scattered short positions were urgently covered, further strengthening the upward momentum. As a result, all months rose by 1.5 to 3 yuan compared to the morning's closing price. It was found that Yichang sold 3,300 bales, Dachang 800 bales, Fukang 1,100 bales, Tonghe 1,550 bales, Taichang 1,150 bales, Changfeng 650 bales, Hengchang 1,000 bales, Shengyuan 1,050 bales, and Shenchang 650 bales. Gengfeng bought 5,300 bales, Tongfu 700 bales, Jinchang 1,000 bales, Hengchang 1,200 bales, Hexing 1,400 bales, Xiesheng 1,400 bales, and Fengtai 700 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Thread prices rose by one or two yuan, but current yarn sales remain sluggish. Statistics show that various guilds bought a total of 591 bales throughout the day, with prices remaining flat. Thread prices rose by 1.2 yuan. The buying amounts of various guilds are listed below.</p>
<p>The cotton market was generally flat, as cotton stocks in this port have not decreased, factory demand is mediocre, Indian cotton is weak, and market sentiment is softening. However, the rise in Osaka's Sanpin flower slightly influenced the market. In the afternoon, the yarn market improved, and market prices were raised by this factor.</p>
<h3>Standard Flower</h3>
<p>Extremely Strong Buying Interest in Standard Flower. The opening of the standard flower market saw a slight increase in American cotton and a weakening of Indian cotton. However, Osaka's third-grade flower soared by two or three yuan, exciting the market. There was talk of a long position in the forward Japanese exchange rate, so market sentiment was still peaceful, and new buyers were not enthusiastic. As a result, all months rose by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, rumors were rampant as the telegram from the third-grade flower market had not arrived, and buying interest was especially strong, pushing market prices up step by step. As a result, all months rose by 0.35 to 0.55 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yuanxingchang sold 1,400 dan, Xinchang 3,100 dan, Juxing 2,900 dan, Yuanda 1,300 dan, Shengyuan 5,100 dan, Jinchang 2,200 dan, Mingde 1,600 dan, Ruida 1,500 dan, Yichang 3,700 dan, and Dachangcheng 1,600 dan. Yuda bought 3,200 dan, Yuanyi 1,000 dan, Jifeng 2,000 dan, Xingchang 3,200 dan, Shenji 4,400 dan, Changfeng 3,100 dan, Runkang 5,200 dan, and Fengtai 7,200 dan, Fukang 1,560 dan. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Current Cotton Consumption is Very Sluggish. Cotton mills have weak appetite. 1,180 bales of Dao flower and 1,918 bales of Tong flower arrived.</p>
<p>Third Grade Only Has Opening Transactions</p>
<p>Yarn Rises Around Ten Yuan</p>
<p>Flower Good at Three Yuan and Five Jiao</p>
<p>Eleventh Osaka Telegram, Third Grade only had opening transactions, Future yarn rose by 8.4 to 10.1 yuan, Near month was 290 yuan, Far month was 273 yuan, Future cotton rose by 2.5 to 3.5 yuan, Near month was 75.7 yuan, Far month was 80.2 yuan,</p>
<p>Indian Cotton Shipments to Japan Increased Sharply Last Week</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth Drops in Price Across the Board</p>
<p>Transactions Are Clear as Settlement Period Nears</p>
<p>Quality of New Brands is Mixed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was stagnant, and current sales were sluggish. As the Lunar New Year approaches, cloth merchants are reducing credit transactions, hoping to end them early. The actual demand from the Guangzhou, Wuzhou, and Kunming guilds in the south remains extremely dull, with only a little over a hundred packages of light and heavyweight coarse cloth purchased. Shantou and Xiamen slightly purchased fifty or sixty pieces of colored cloth, coarse cloth, broadcloth, fine twill, and five-six cloth. The Sichuan guild slightly purchased over two hundred pieces of yuan gray, navy blue fine twill, blue cloth, and fine cloth. The Shandong guild purchased over a hundred cases of local-factory serge, broadcloth, and blue cloth. The Jiangzhe and inland guilds were the most quiet, and the business of storefronts was also very sparse. White goods, fine cloth, fine twill, raw cloth, and East goods remained firm, with a slight decrease of 0.25 fen. Local-factory fine cloth and fine twill continued to decrease by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan per piece. Local-factory and English-factory coarse cloth and heavyweight goods, such as 13, 14, and 16-pound grades, fell by about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan per piece. Lightweight coarse cloth remained at the original price. Blue cloth and colored twill remained sluggish, occasionally falling in price by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan per piece. New brands sold at cheaper prices, with a difference of 0.5 to 1 yuan for the same cloth quality. White flannel has lost its popularity, with prices falling repeatedly, causing great confusion in the market. However, bleached cloth has seen a slight increase in price of around 0.1 yuan due to factory shortages.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>Soybean Oil Plunges by Eighty or Ninety Jiao</p>
<p>Ultimately Unable to Escape Dalian's Influence</p>
<p>Recently, the soybean oil market has been dull due to slow sales. Although Dalian prices have mostly risen with few falls, market sentiment has been weak, and the market has been stagnant for a week. Yesterday, news came that Dalian prices had fallen, and trading began, with prices falling by 0.8 or 0.9 yuan compared to the price seven days ago (the fourth), including 200 pieces of local factory oil, 450 pieces of ship Niuzhuang oil, 100 pieces of ship Dalian oil, 50 pieces of ship Shahe Qishan oil, 100 pieces of sandboat Yantai Qishan oil, and future trends, if no clear sales channels, may be fixed again,</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Future Wheat Market Suddenly Plunges in Afternoon Session</p>
<p>Spot Goods Mills are Not Greedy</p>
<p>Flour Sales are Also Clear</p>
<p>Yesterday, the future wheat market opened in the morning, with prices initially stabilizing and then falling. As foreign wheat quotations from the US and Canada both rebounded by 0.5 yuan, market sentiment was stable after the opening, rising by 0.01 yuan compared to the previous week's closing price. However, as the settlement period neared, trading across all channels slowed down, and customers with actual goods were considering selling their positions, leading to a very flat market sentiment. By the afternoon opening, market sentiment suddenly softened as the current wheat mill demand was not checked, and quotations were low, causing the current month to fall first, dropping by 0.05 or 0.06 yuan compared to the morning. Distant months saw more outside speculators closing their positions, leading to a rapid fall and active trading. This situation was due to sluggish flour sales, leading to a natural downward trend. The spot wheat market saw very clear transactions, and prices also loosened by 0.05 yuan. 6.51 to 6.5 jiao yuan per bag of Tiantai wheat, 6.48 yuan per bag of Shaoxing wheat, followed by 6.4 yuan, totaling over 2,000 bags, which were reportedly purchased by Fufeng.</p>
<p>Future Flour Shows Slight Rebound</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of recovery at the morning opening. As foreign wheat quotations from Chicago and Canada both rose by 0.5 yuan, near and distant months rose by 0.03 or 0.04 yuan compared to the previous week's closing price. However, as the settlement period was approaching, customers were mostly watching and waiting. Only the Beijing guild continued to purchase, but some speculators took advantage of the high prices to close their positions, leading to a flat trend after the second session. As the afternoon opening approached, initial actual sales were weak, and wheat quotations were also flat. All months fell slightly by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan, but then both buyers and sellers were scarce, and outside speculators slightly purchased, stabilizing the market somewhat. Judging by the current situation, if sales to the north stop, the results for this month may trend downwards.</p>
<p>Guangdong is Actively Purchasing Rough Sen Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the incoming and outgoing sales of guest Sen rice were active, and market sentiment was excellent. Since the Guangdong guild began purchasing from Shanghai, its appetite has gradually increased. Yesterday, rough rice was actively purchased in the market, and market sentiment was increasingly optimistic. Moreover, the Shantou guild followed suit, and the Guangdong guild still had a strong appetite. However, there was not much rough rice in floating storage, and merchants and brokers insisted on holding on to their stock. Yesterday, market prices rose sharply by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan, and mechanically milled white rice was also slightly boosted. Furthermore, the Guangdong and Shantou guilds did not purchase enough yesterday. If incoming goods are not plentiful today and tomorrow, market prices may need to become more competitive again. A total of 8,730 bags of Jiangxi rice, 500 bags of Hunan rice, 2,000 bags of Hankou rough rice, 500 bags of Anhui rough rice, and 2,000 bags of Wensen rice were sold, all of which were distributed by the Guangdong and Shantou merchants. Other guilds were watching and waiting.</p>
<p>White Geng Market Situation Turns Firm in the Afternoon</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of each guild totaled more than 70 locations, a total of 14,340 stones of goods. Among them, there were more than 40 locations for Bo rice. The sales market in this street was slightly better than before, and the appetite also felt slightly moving. It is estimated that the Tianjin and Qingdao guilds purchased more than 2,000 bags of Bo rice, which stabilized the market situation. The price of Bo rice had nothing to celebrate, but the sales channel for Hou Geng remained sluggish, leading to a continued price drop of one jiao. The future market situation seems more stable, Duyangjian is slightly soft, and Yinyuan is lacking competition,</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various roads under the river were slightly scarce, about ten stores, but the existing stocks were still heavy, and the market's sales were still sluggish, and the customers wanted to stop selling because the prices in the producing areas were still expensive. The merchants cleverly stocked up the white geng at the later market, with a slight loss of sales, plus some scattered users also slightly advanced. The price of the early market was small by one or two jiao, and the afternoon market turned firm. The early rice was one jiao small, the Bo rice was one or two jiao small, the Yang Dubu Jian price was tired a small number of points, the Baiyuan price was soft five or six points, the Yinyuan goods were few, and the price was firm, and at the closing of the later market, the prices of various goods were stable.</p>
<p>A Review of the Guest Xian Market Situation in 1936</p>
<p>(Continued from the Ninth)</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>American US Steel Rises by Two and a Half Yuan</p>
<p>Black Iron Sheet Transacted Four to Five Hundred Bundles Daily</p>
<p>Recently, the arrival of 200-pound American US steel has been very scarce, and the local stock is weak. The current market price is 39.5 yuan per case, an increase of 2.5 yuan compared to before. There are transactions with Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and various guilds along the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Black iron sheets are also in short supply due to high trading volume. Enamel factories, thermos factories, and silver box workshops are all purchasing, so prices continue to rise. 2.6-foot, 18-sheet floral pattern sells for 12 yuan, second grade sells for 11 yuan, 3.6-foot sells for 14 yuan, and rough floral pattern sells for 12.5 yuan. It is estimated that daily shipments reach 400 to 500 bundles.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Ji Li Silk Rises Another Ten Yuan Compared to Last Week</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Yokohama silk market fell slightly, with both current and futures prices falling by seven to ten yuan, causing the local foreign firm silk market to become even more silent. For example, the American firm's white factory's R-grade, seven to eight evenness, 20.22-strip limit price was only 800 yuan, a difference of more than 30 yuan from the Shanghai silk merchants' asking price, resulting in very few transactions. In the Indian firm's silk market, Ji Li opened at a new high price again yesterday. For example, the Qianjinma grade sold for 635 yuan yesterday, an increase of 10 yuan compared to last week, which is truly commendable. The user silk market is not deserted, but due to the high silk prices, transactions are not active. 2 pieces were sold yesterday.</p>
<p>Moroccan Green Tea Continues to Fall</p>
<p>Spanish War Becomes Increasingly Serious</p>
<p>Stocks Are Sold at a Loss</p>
<p>According to news from Morocco, the market for various green teas has been plummeting in the past week. Authoritative Jewish tea merchants, in view of the increasingly significant international nature of the Spanish war and the sluggish commercial signs in the ports of the French Morocco region, are selling their stocks at a loss and ordering their agents here to stop shipping scheduled green teas. The current selling price of top and middle-grade Zhenmei green tea is over 80 French francs lower per dan than at the end of last year. Other varieties such as Zhenmei and Zhuma are also down 30 to 90 French francs. The situation is extremely worrying.</p>
<h3>Special</h3>
<p>The Production, Sales, and Manufacture of Qihong (Day 1 Continued)</p>
<p>(5) This Year's Tea Prices</p>
<p>In previous years, Qihong new tea was launched on the market around mid-May. This year, due to the authorities of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces implementing unified control over the transportation and sale of Qining black tea, Shanghai tea houses opposed it en masse. As a result, although the new tea had arrived in Shanghai, foreign firms had not purchased it due to unresolved disputes. It was not until May 29 that price negotiations began, and official transaction records started on the 30th. This year, the highest price for the first batch of Qihong tea reached 275 yuan per market dan, with the remaining prices below 270 yuan, and the lowest price was only 42 yuan. The highest price for the second batch of tea was 240 yuan, and the lowest price was only 28.5 yuan. The highest price for the third batch of tea reached 175 yuan, and the lowest price was 23 yuan. The highest price for the fourth batch of tea was 90 yuan, and the lowest was 18 yuan. The highest price for flower tea was 42 yuan, and the lowest was 12 yuan. The huge difference in prices is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>In terms of tea prices, regardless of the batch, the improved black tea from the Qimen Tea Industry Improvement Center fetched the highest price. The tea produced by other tea merchants with tea-making experience also fetched good prices. In terms of region, the price of Qimen tea was higher than that of Fuliang. For example, the highest price for the first batch of Qihong tea was 275 yuan in Qimen, 220 yuan in Fuliang, and only 117 yuan in Zhide, which is a significant difference. The price difference for the other second and third batches of tea was smaller than that for the first batch, but the trend was the same. In other words, the price of Zhide and Guichi black tea was the lowest, followed by Fuliang, and the price of Qimen tea was the highest. This is consistent with the quality of the tea. This is because Zhide and Fuliang harvest later, so the appearance, color, aroma, taste, and leaf base of the tea are inferior to those of Qimen.</p>
<p>However, not all tea produced in Qimen is superior to that of Fuliang, and some are inferior to Fuliang tea. Therefore, the above is only a general statement. The quality of tea making and the level of market prices depend entirely on the tea house's tea-making experience. Therefore, preventing the occurrence of inferior tea does not lie in promoting the production of a certain tea area, but in emphasizing the tea house's capital and experience and preventing indiscriminate establishment. As for Fuliang and Zhide counties, it is particularly important to promote tender production. That is, the public and buyers should not stubbornly adhere to preconceived notions about Fuliang tea, but should bid based on quality. Then the tea industry in Fuliang can be developed, and the quality of Qihong tea can be improved through competition.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the quality of high-mountain tea is better than that of low-mountain tea. The difference in the quality of black tea in various parts of the Qiqu area is said to be due to the influence of the natural environment. The temperature, humidity, and rainfall in the Qiqu area are only recorded by the Pingli Tea Industry Improvement Center in the southern countryside of Qimen over the years. As for Fuliang and Zhide counties, there is no such record, so we dare not speculate on it. As for the altitude of each area (land height), we have slightly measured the areas surveyed this year. The altitude of the area with the most tea production in the southwest of Qimen is usually between 160 meters and 300 meters. Gaoling in the northern countryside reaches 750 meters, but there is not much tea produced. As for the area in the northern countryside of Fuliang that borders Qixian, the altitude is also above 200 meters. The altitude of the upper, middle, and lower villages in Zhide is lower, about 150 meters. It is not possible to determine whether the reason for the inferior quality of Zhide tea is entirely due to this without further research. However, high-mountain tea often benefits from the moisture of clouds and fog, so it seems to have a higher aroma than low-mountain tea. Is this the reason why Zhide tea is inferior? This requires further research.</p>
<p>In short, although good raw materials can be produced at high altitudes, they cannot necessarily be used to produce excellent black tea, as mentioned above. Good raw tea materials often deteriorate due to prolonged delays or careless refining by tea houses. Therefore, even if the altitude is high, the quality of the finished tea is not uniformly good.</p>
<p>The high price of Qihong this year is the first year after 1931. The reasons for the improvement in the price of Qihong tea are nothing more than two:</p>
<p>1. The exchange rate has shrunk by about 30% since the implementation of the legal tender policy, so the market price of Chinese tea has the potential to increase by 30%.</p>
<p>2. Due to the effectiveness of unified transportation and sales.</p>
<p>The above two points are the reasons for the improvement in the price of Qihong, and the latter is particularly helpful in raising the price of tea. Can it be said that the exchange rate has shrunk this year, so the price of tea should generally increase. However, according to the facts, this is not the case. The market price of black tea, except for Qining tea, has not seen an increase. The prices of various green teas are also almost the same as last year. Therefore, the unique high price of Qining black tea is not entirely due to the reduction in the exchange rate, but to the unified transportation and sales. Without the unified transportation and sales of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, foreign merchants could still implement a divide-and-conquer policy for tea houses, achieving their goal of suppressing prices. Tea houses are agencies that sell tea on behalf of inland tea houses, and gains and losses are irrelevant. However, inland tea merchants suffer. Although the tea houses' opposition to control is inappropriate, it is understandable in terms of fighting for survival; however, a small number of tea houses blindly follow suit, destroying the government's control, and it is truly unknown what their intentions are.</p>
<p>Although the price of Qihong tea is high this year, not many people get the average price, and the remaining prices are mostly in the 70 to 80 yuan range, and as low as 40 to 50 yuan. However, the mountain price of raw tea in the Qiqu area this year is lower than in previous years due to price suppression by various tea houses. The cost of the first batch of finished tea is about 100 to 120 yuan, the second batch of tea is about 60 to 70 yuan, the third batch of tea is 40 to 50 yuan, and the fourth batch of tea is only 30 to 40 yuan. The average cost of refined tea is about 60 yuan per market dan. This only applies to Qimen. As for Fuliang black tea, the cost is even lower, because the mountain price of raw tea is not as high as in Qimen.</p>
<p>The cost of Qihong is low and the selling price is high, so tea houses in the Qiqu area, except for a few that have losses due to inferior tea making, generally have profits to be made. This is a rare good news in recent years.</p>
<p>(6) The Future of Black Tea</p>
<p>The premise of promoting domestic products is "low price and good quality." Tea is no longer an agricultural product monopolized by our country. India, Ceylon, and the Dutch East Indies produce and sell more black tea than our country; therefore, the survival of our country's tea in the future depends on reasonably priced and good-quality products to survive in the world market. Qihong tea has not yet reached the expected quality, and its price is higher than that of Indian and Ceylon black tea. It is difficult to attract the attention of European and American people to increase sales. In the face of the global wave of economic recession, there are not many people who buy tea at high prices. However, everyone seeks to improve their lives, and they hope to obtain satisfactory quality at the lowest price when drinking tea. Therefore, if Qihong tea wants to expand sales, reducing prices is as important as improving quality. Among the domestic black teas in the British market, only Qihong tea can be sold separately. If the black tea in the two lakes can only be sold mixed with Indian and Ceylon tea, the sales of Qihong tea are more independent and promising. If improvements are made in terms of quality, cost, selling price, and promotion, it will not be difficult to restore the past glory of Qihong tea. (End)</p>

<h3>Sketches of Great Shanghai</h3>
<p>— (Fang Zheng)</p>
<p>A Pilgrimage to Stone Road</p>
<p>Stone Road is the only clothing agency for the poor, because it is not easy to make clothes in Shanghai. The materials are expensive, the workmanship is high, and it is troublesome! But Stone Road solves everything for the poor. As long as you choose clothes that are similar to your size, you can wear them at any time. It is simple and economical. Therefore, most of the clothes of the so-called "old door sill" in Shanghai are picked up on Stone Road.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I followed a friend on a tour of Stone Road. As usual, many tempting winter clothes were hung there, great horse-riding coats, fur robes, camel down robes, cotton trousers, woollen shirts, scarves... In short, everything was available. At the same time, they, the clothing store, shouted out particularly cheap sacrificial items in front of the so-called "beach platform", which attracted many workers in short clothes and vagrant children in gowns and long shirts, squeezing and looking, hoping to obtain "cheap and good" items to keep out the cold. But some people are "pickpockets" for life, because when people are completely focused on cheap goods, they use their magical skills to secretly steal your wallet, so all "old thresholds" are quite wary of this.</p>
<p>Because I wanted to find a camel down robe, I searched more than ten shops before I found a target in a large double-wide shop.</p>
<p>This clothes face is too new, I am afraid it is not an original pawn, right? I asked the shop assistant in the tone of "old door sill".</p>
<p>"Sir: Ge piece of clothing is completely genuine original pawned goods. Look, isn't this the trace of the pawnshop?" He pointed to the folded marks on his chest to show me.</p>
<p>According to "old door sill", you should buy the original pawned goods when buying clothes, because it is worn by people. It is full of pawnshops. The materials and workmanship are more exquisite. I chose the clothes. What is the price? According to the shop assistant, it is fourteen taels, (this is the rule of the clothing store, each tael is calculated at ten corners, and the actual price is nine yuan and eight corners). Because I found it relatively cheap, the transaction was successful.</p>
<p>I wore the robe back in the evening. On the road, I proudly glanced at my fellow travelers wearing long shirts. But my heart felt as heavy as green lead.</p>
<h3>The Oriental St. Petersburg, etc.</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Ten years ago, in Shanghai, which has the reputation of the Oriental Paris, there was an area called "The Oriental St. Petersburg," located in the western part of the French Concession, near Avenue Joffre, now known as the Street of Mystery. At that time, the White Russians who fled from Russia and settled in Shanghai almost all lived there. As a result, Russian-style hotels, bookstores, grocery stores, etc., sprung up on Avenue Joffre, which was originally very lonely. The French-style Avenue Joffre was filled with Russian flavor. Therefore, everyone called Avenue Joffre "The Oriental St. Petersburg."</p>
<p>Ten years is a small change. The Oriental St. Petersburg cannot escape this formula, from prosperity to decline. Because in these ten years, the Russians in the Oriental St. Petersburg have only survived by one or two tenths compared to ten years ago. And after the sound of cannons on January 28th stopped, most of the mysterious caves on North Sichuan Road had been moved to Avenue Joffre, so the original tempting alias of North Sichuan Road, "Street of Mystery", was also moved to Avenue Joffre. So now whoever mentions Avenue Joffre will naturally say "Street of Mystery," and everyone has forgotten "The Oriental St. Petersburg" indifferently.</p>
<p>Although the Oriental St. Petersburg has been gradually forgotten in these ten years, in the Hongkou District, a so-called "Little Tokyo" has appeared in these ten years. This so-called "Little Tokyo" is the short section of Wusong Road from Sanjiao Vegetable Market in the east to Shenjiawan in the west. There were originally many shops of a certain country on this street. Since the cannon fire on January 28th destroyed North Sichuan Road, the signs of shops of a certain country on Wusong Road have become denser. It is said that the current so-called "Little Tokyo", shops of a certain country, account for more than eight tenths. If you slip past in that area without paying much attention, you will be sure to be stimulated in your eyes by the completely certain country-ized color, and forget that you are still in Shanghai.</p>
<p>After January 28th, during a small prosperous period, it is said that Shanghai's Little Tokyo had a very prosperous time. But since the unfortunate incidents have been discovered one after another in the past one or two years, the prosperity of Little Tokyo has been declining. In the past, the lively scenes after dinner have been swallowed up by steel helmets and bayonets protecting the safety of overseas Chinese. Although there are still Chinese people walking in Little Tokyo now, certain country people are still smiling and warmly welcoming Chinese customers, but compared to two years ago, it is also a bit unbearable to look back at those days.</p>
<p>The Oriental St. Petersburg has become a relic of the past, and Little Tokyo is also showing signs of decline. People in Shanghai who love exotic customs do not know where they will create a prosperous center with exotic customs in the future?</p>
<h3>Wenmiao Road</h3>
<p>— Shi Hua</p>
<p>On Saturday or Sunday afternoons, you see thousands upon thousands of people flocking to the gates of the zoo or the Temple of Confucius. Although the inside is already packed with people, and the entrance is crowded with people scrambling to buy tickets (zoo tickets cost six coppers), the crowds surging from Zhonghua Road, Penglai Road, and Wenmiao Road (northern section) are still so numerous that it can be nearly impossible to pass.</p>
<p>This crowd includes small businessmen who only have Sundays off, "country folk" who have come to Shanghai for a visit... In short, it encompasses farmers, workers, merchants, students, soldiers, the elderly, children, men, women, the tall, the short, the thin, and the fat—everything and everyone is there. Sometimes, even some foreigners come in cars to visit!</p>
<p>I dare to say boldly: "Wenmiao Road on Saturdays and Sundays is a gathering place for the people of Shanghai."</p>
<p>Even on weekdays, although not as crowded as on Saturdays and Sundays, the liveliness is no less. After four o'clock, students just released from school naturally head towards Wenmiao Road. At this time, Wenmiao Road becomes a place for male and female students to chase after each other. Female students carry leather satchels, chatting in groups of three or five about school news. Male students, with thick Western-style books under their arms and neatly pressed uniforms, also in groups of three or five, talk about things like, "Miss Chen didn't reply to my letter!" or "Zhu Xufang was with Lao Lin at Jin Cheng yesterday!" ... and so on.</p>
<p>"Smith Wang, did you receive my letter!" a male student asks, chasing after a female student who has just walked past him.</p>
<p>"..." The other party does not reply, only lowers her head even further.</p>
<p>"...Why didn't you reply!" the male student asks again, stepping closer.</p>
<p>The female student rolls her eyes at the male student, then quickens her pace and runs away. The male student then retreats, feeling dejected.</p>
<p>Around five o'clock, the crowd gradually thins out, and the bell inside the Temple of Confucius rings, signaling closing time. The sky slowly, slowly darkens, finally entering the night stage. Wenmiao Road at night becomes eerily quiet, with hardly any pedestrians to be found. Only the fallen leaves of the plane trees by the roadside drift thickly in the street, replacing the daytime pedestrians.</p>
<h3>The Wardrobe Escape (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>The Heroic Deeds of a French Mother and Daughter</p>
<p>Upon arriving home, she prepared some food for Mr. Fuller. Poor Mr. Fuller, having spent over four months sleeping in the deep forest, now sat comfortably indoors and enjoyed a hearty meal. Mrs. Bascon, because her own home was small and had no place to hide Mr. Fuller, then sent the British soldier to his mother-in-law, Mrs. Gopeer. Her house was larger and easier to find a place to hide. However, her family's life was not well-off. Normally, her daughter Angelia earned a living working in a weaving factory. Now that the weaving factory had been destroyed by the German army, Angelia relied only on a sewing machine at home to support her mother and younger sister. Adding the food needed for this guest would inevitably make things even more difficult. Angelia, however, did not worry about this, willing to work hard to overcome this difficulty. What was concerning was that harboring an enemy soldier, if discovered by the German soldiers, would mean that everyone, even if not sentenced to death, would taste the flavor of iron bars. What to do? Angelia suddenly had an idea, exclaiming: "We have it! The wardrobe, the wardrobe!" This wardrobe was placed in the corner of a ground-floor room, about five and a half feet tall, divided into two compartments, one for storing miscellaneous items and the other for hanging clothes. So, they took out the clothes and asked Mr. Fuller to enter. This wardrobe was later purchased by Sir Charles and donated to the Imperial War Museum, where it is still on display.</p>
<p>In later years, Mr. Fuller said to people: "At that time, to meet the immediate need, I could only reluctantly comply with the owner's kindness and lie down in the wardrobe. At first, I thought I would only be hiding for a day or two, but later I realized that there was no way to escape. If discovered, my own life was not important, but it would implicate the owner. So, I had no choice but to endure the pain and lie inside for a long time."</p>
<p>Since Mr. Fuller hid in the wardrobe, everyone was anxious, praying day and night that the secret would not be discovered and that Mr. Fuller would have a day to see the light again. However, unexpected dangers occurred at any time. One day, Mrs. Gopeer received an order that eight German soldiers would be staying in her home for a few days. Military orders could not be disobeyed, so Mrs. Gopeer and her daughter hurriedly made arrangements to avoid revealing any flaws. Therefore, when the German soldiers came, although they often sat in the room a few feet away from the wardrobe, they did not notice that an enemy soldier was hiding in the wardrobe. According to Mr. Fuller, what he feared most at the time was coughing. Once, he suddenly felt like sneezing, and he tried hard to hold it back, thus avoiding being exposed. That was truly dangerous.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly, and Mr. Fuller had been hiding in the wardrobe for about eighteen months. Suddenly, an order was issued to requisition the entire house of Mrs. Gopeer, ordering Mrs. Gopeer to move out within a time limit. So, Mrs. Gopeer rented a house nearby and prepared to move. But how to arrange for this British soldier? Moving had to be done during the day, but Mr. Fuller dared not go out except at night. Later, everyone agreed that Mr. Fuller should still hide in the wardrobe and be moved along with it. Mrs. Bascon then invited a trusted lumberjack friend to help, and the two used all their strength to move the wardrobe out of the room. At this moment, a strong German soldier hurried downstairs, and seeing the two sweating profusely, he rushed forward and exclaimed: "Let me help you - oh, how heavy this is!" Mrs. Gopeer remained calm and replied calmly: "Yes, I have piled all the heavy things inside." She also said: "Sir, please don't open the wardrobe door, because there are many glass objects inside."</p>
<h3>Snow Treading in the Bund Park</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>In the wind and snow, I mustered my courage, widened my steps, and stuck out my belly as I walked towards the Huangpu Riverbank, not feeling cold at all. Snowflakes were falling thick and fast on the Huangpu Bund Road. There were fewer vehicles and horses on the road than usual, and there were not as many pedestrians as usual either. Although trams and buses still came and went according to the scheduled times, the number of passengers had clearly decreased significantly, and there was not nearly as much crowding as usual. The grass by the river was covered with a layer of white snow. Along the river, apart from a few coolies walking occasionally, there were no other pedestrians to be seen. Each time the municipal ferry docked, only a few passengers boarded or disembarked.</p>
<p>I walked to the iron railing and looked far out into the river. The ships coming and going in the Huangpu River, just like the road above, were much fewer than usual. The northwest wind struck the heart of the Huangpu River in gusts, stirring up giant waves capable of swallowing ships. Snow fell on the shore, where it would accumulate, but when it fell into the Huangpu River, it disappeared without a trace, having long been conquered and melted by the water. The foreign ships and giant vessels anchored in the river, covered with a layer of white snow, could also be vaguely seen. Looking at Pudong, all the factories and houses were indistinct because of the falling snowflakes in the sky. All I could see were some blurred black shadows.</p>
<p>The row of iron-framed chairs by the river were usually always full of people, but when it snowed, no one sat there idly admiring the scenery of the Huangpu River, leaving empty chairs covered with white snow. The snowflakes in the sky fell thick and fast, melting immediately when they landed on the sidewalk, but accumulating on the grass, dyeing the dry yellow grass on the ground white. Looking out over the entire park, all the pavilions, water fountains, rockeries, and monuments were covered with snow, changing their original colors. Several low-lying evergreen trees, such as holly and cypress, were covered with white snow, creating a green and white contrast that was even more lovely to look at.</p>
<p>The wind was blowing harder and harder, and the snow was falling heavier and heavier. The lone tourists wandering in the park felt a bit of coldness on their bodies and could not stay long. Shall I go? So, I took a circle in the park and then came out. At this time, it was already dusk. The tall buildings on the Huangpu Riverbank appeared as blurred images in the lightly flying white snow, and even the customs clock could not be seen clearly. Even the light of the electric lamps seemed much weaker than usual. Returning home in the heavy snow, my wife asked me if I felt cold going to the riverbank to see the snow in such cold weather. I answered bluntly: "If I feel cold in this kind of snow, how are those fighting the enemy in the frozen wilderness?"</p>
<h3>Swapping Nests, Matching Phoenixes</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 10 (Su Paqi Intertwines Strange Texts, Errors in Casting, Yellow Flowers Grieve, Autumn Letters Add Sorrow)</p>
<p>In these words of his, he truly gave Guoshi a great deal of comfort. He thought to himself that having someone like Menglan as a lifelong companion, or even as a friend, someone to correspond with in writing, someone who was a reader of his works, was a truly comforting thing in this life. He was a literary drudge, and all he had gained was his mother's loving kindness. Although he had a few friends, their backgrounds, temperaments, and studies were all different, and it was difficult to be completely in tune with them, to form a bond of sworn brotherhood. Now that he had Menglan, this deficiency was made up for. Thinking of this, he felt refreshed, so he sat down at his desk, arranged his paper and brush, and wrote a piece of prose that was neither prose nor poetry without adding a single dot. The text was:</p>
<p>My spirit is excited by her, my thoughts are sharpened by her, my life is sweetened by her, and my environment is made prosperous by her. I also do not understand why she is so great to me. But when I am illuminated by her clear eyes, it is like the cross adding blessing to my soul, the water of the willow branch adding moisture to my lungs. I respect her as I would a Buddha, but do not see her solemnity. I love her as I would a flower, but do not see her嬌艷. I admire her as I would the moon, but do not see her remoteness. I approach her as I would snow, but do not see her coldness. In short, all of me is now dominated by her, but I feel that before I knew this person, I was one kind of person. After knowing this person, I am another kind of person. Why am I like this, I do not know myself, I can only ask the creator. Yet I have not even exchanged a single word with her.</p>
<p>His thoughts surged, and he wrote in one breath without knowing how, until he wrote that "also" character, completing the sentence, and then put down his pen. He read it again to himself, and it seemed to please him. He smiled slightly. Because it was written in a moment of high spirits, he could not bear to throw it away, nor did he think about it much. He folded the paper and put it in his drawer. That afternoon, because of other things, he put this matter aside. By the next day, he had forgotten about it. As for Menglan's letter, because he had learned that it was very dangerous to send letters through the post office after receiving her report, he put the letter he had written in his drawer and did not send it out. He thought to himself that since Youmei had left this note, she would come every day, so he would wait. (121)</p>
<h3>Sketches on the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>It's getting cold. In the morning, I climbed out of the warm bed, rubbed my sleepy eyes, and put on the icy clothes. My lips and teeth chattered against each other, and my body seemed to tremble like a vibrating string. After a hasty wash, I carried a book, braved the cold morning wind, and strode along the banks of the Suzhou Creek. But the morning mist was very thick, permeating the entire metropolis. All the scenery was hidden under this veil of mist, and it was not easy to make out things even a mere ten feet away.</p>
<p>The rumbling of wheels broke the silence of the space, but the white, misty fog was pressing lower and lower, so low that it was almost impossible to see oneself clearly. One by one, trams and trucks were already swimming in the middle of the road with their heavy bodies. Beside the Waibaidu Bridge, a milky-yellow skyscraper appeared faintly in the sky. It seemed like a beautiful girl, draped in a light gauze, standing there endearingly. Shadowy figures moved dimly along the bridge railings. Several riverboats roared with sharp, strange noises, causing cracks in the solidified sky, but the small steamers passed under the Waibaidu Bridge in this thick fog, advancing towards the misty river surface.</p>
<p>The Suzhou Creek and the Rihui Port are two equally important inland ports. Especially the Suzhou Creek, it is like a belt spanning the middle of the International Settlement, dividing the International Settlement into two sections, north and south. Moreover, since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the Suzhou Creek has become a chasm of safety and danger.</p>
<p>Many firms and inland river shipping bureaus are located on the south bank. Every morning or evening, the vegetable market at the old Zhabei Bridge and the mountain goods stores at the Touba will be lively as usual. The small steamers and fast boats in the river are busy all day long, going out, coming in, empty, full, adorning the river surface quite lively. It is like the blood vessel of this city. As long as it stops beating, the city, which contains endless happiness and sin, sadness and joy, will die with it.</p>
<p>As usual, every evening, near the section between the waterworks bridge and the Zhapu Road, there are always many empty boats parked here. They are always arranged so densely that there is not even a gap between them. At dinner time, a wisp of white smoke comes out of the stern of each boat. Seeing the countless wisps of white smoke combine on the river surface, they finally disappear into the flowing waves. After dinner, some of them put up cloth awnings and stretched their arms straight, lying on the flat surface; others gathered around a dim mast lamp and played cards on the stern of the boat. Their leisurely lives seemed to realize that the current situation was still a peaceful world, and they seemed not to have thought about the severity of the national crisis or the pain of life. But when I opened my eyes and looked at the waves on the Huangpu River, and listened to the cries from North China, I couldn't help but feel a little confused.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Medical Special</p>
<h3>From the Reform of Health Administrative Institutions to the So-Called Chinese and Western Medicine Problem (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Hua Xinren</p>
<p>Academics has no boundaries, so there is fundamentally no need to divide medicine into "Chinese" and "Western" medicine. Similarly, in terms of career and academic research, as long as it is for the welfare of mankind and the public as a prerequisite, we should cooperate with mutual trust and understanding. Therefore, we should not have the names and boundaries of Chinese and Western medicine, and even more so, we must not retain this feudal and strong color in the current stage.</p>
<p>The difference in the names of Chinese and Western medicine precisely reflects the inferior nature of our nation, because we should seek reasonable progress, and cannot tolerate conservative degeneration. Therefore, the names of Chinese and Western medicine fundamentally cannot exist in theory, and should be clearly divided into "scientific and non-scientific," which I believe is correct.</p>
<p>Our understanding of all things should be analyzed with reason, and not rejected with emotion. Especially for the public health work of the whole people, we should use a strong and rational discrimination. Subjectivity cannot determine the survival or destruction of Chinese and Western medicine, and even more so, we cannot use "people" as the object and unit in therapeutics to determine the fate of Chinese and Western medicine. Therefore, the survival or destruction of Chinese and Western medicine should be based on the theory. This is right.</p>
<p>Chinese medicine has its own historical value, but what is lamentable is that Chinese medicine, from Shennong tasting hundreds of herbs to the practical Compendium of Materia Medica today, has never had any improvements. This is what is meant by Chinese medicine losing its scientific and forward-looking research, and falling off the axis of the times. The way of learning is that if you do not advance, you retreat. In other words, "conservative stubbornness" is corrupt and backward. Only "catching up" is progressive and scientific. In the current situation, are we choosing to "catch up" or "persistently conservative"?</p>
<p>Currently, some people advocate reforming the health administrative institutions and list reasons. However, based on facts and needs, our country's health administrative institutions are not yet ready for reform. Health work is a career to protect the lives of the whole people, and its responsibility is directly responsible to the lives of the people, and indirectly related to the rise and fall of the nation. Therefore, health undertakings are a kind of academic research and scientific work, and not a power struggle organization. In the past, the people of our country lacked trust in hygiene, and the government officials were unwilling to promote it, so it formed the current national weakness, the people's physical poverty, and the high mortality rate. According to statistical reports, the average annual death rate in our country is 12 million people, and the economic loss due to excess deaths is 300,000 million national currency. The percentage of deaths from infectious diseases is 43.3% - Japan is 29.0%. This is enough to prove that health work is urgently needed in the current internal environment. The serious problem that occurs in the current stage is not the reform of the organizational structure of the health administrative institutions, but how to enrich and develop the domestic health undertakings. It is also not the right to divide the rights of the minister of Western medicine and the minister of Chinese medicine, but to think about how to implement public medical construction? How to carry out scientific research on Chinese medicine? I think that in the development of the career and the welfare of the people, we should trust and cooperate with each other to devote ourselves to the construction of public medicine. According to a reason, people generally feel that the current Chinese health administrative institutions are biased towards Western medicine and squeeze Chinese medicine out of the line, which has caused resentment and advocated practical reform. This is somewhat of a subjective problem. If the atom of the current advocacy of reform is focused on the power struggle, then it is on the road to extreme contradictions, because this slogan occurs in the interest of spirit and matter, and sacrifices and ignores the welfare of the people. Therefore, although advocating reform, failure is undoubtedly. For more than ten years, there has been a gap between Chinese and Western medicine, and the doctrine of "governing each other" has been promoted, and many portals have been established separately. In many debates, emotions have become increasingly estranged. Therefore, I think that the consciousness of those who advocate the reform of health administrative institutions should be based on the fundamental reasons. Otherwise, repeatedly chanting verbally will only lead to disputes of spirit, drum up their tongues and use clever deception to deceive each other and hurt each other. The so-called application of the traditional policy of "distant contacts and close attacks" will inevitably lead to unexpected failures. Therefore, if we want to truly and purely advocate the reform of health administrative institutions to enrich the public health work of the whole people, I think the prerequisite is the adjustment of the Chinese and Western medical circles, and the eradication of the subjective actions of mutual jealousy, slander, and criticism. If you don't start from this point and only discuss the atomic rights division, the result will not only miss the opportunity, but also cause both sides to suffer, and make the nation and the sick unbearable. The main goal of advocating health administration and institutional reform is the problem of the director and deputy director. Since the health administration of our country has been changed from the Ministry to the Department, and the scope has been reduced several times, it has also been used as an official vacancy for the public health work of the whole people. The so-called preventive work and health work have no results. In recent years, health has been changed from the Ministry to the Department, and from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Executive Yuan. Its work is obvious to all. The person in charge has been running the business, so various tasks have been progressing quickly. In the Health Laboratory, special attention is paid to various experimental research work. The most effective is the establishment of a public health personnel training institute to cultivate lower-level cadres. In the difficult national funding, the health administration authorities have struggled hard to achieve the current results. It is not easy to prove that the current health administration authorities are burying their heads in hard work and research, and are doing their best to strengthen the national defense health facilities and strengthen the public health work of the whole people. But here, we want to ask, is the situation of the reform of the health administrative institutions, which is competing for the expansion of power, and making the fate of the Chinese and Western medical circles and the health undertakings fall into a must-die state, out of a need, or is it out of sincerity? There is no doubt that health undertakings cannot be gambled on, nor can any part of the country have the ambition to act recklessly, and no part of the country can be allowed to have great threats to attempt large-scale encroachment. The reason for this is not to say that the current status of Western medicine in the country has maintained the centrifugal force of the country, and made Chinese medicine have to cut off the dream of revenge. I think that if Chinese and Western medicine are really permanently in a position of confrontation, the loss will certainly be unjustified, and the public health of the whole people will also feel a great impact. Therefore, promoting the harmony between Chinese and Western medicine is the top priority at present, and the reform of administrative institutions is the next!</p>
<h3>On Cancer (II)</h3>
<p>— Xiaozhu</p>
<p>Considering the origin of the character "cancer," if we disregard the mechanical aspect, it can be inferred that its intended meaning is derived from a combination of both pictographic and semantic elements. It describes the afflicted object as resembling cancer in shape and nature. Observing the external appearance of a cancerous tumor, the meaning derived from this character aligns almost undoubtedly with what modern medicine refers to as cancer. Furthermore, examining the Western terms for cancer, "Garcinoma" in Latin, "Krebs" in German, and "Cancer" in English, the meaning is also found between pictographic representation and semantic derivation. It suggests that the localized spread of this entity resembles the extension of crab legs, adept at moving sideways. (Originally a general term for various chronic ulcers - from the old medical dictionary) Old medical dictionaries explain the character "癌" (cancer) as describing an object consisting of a tumor mass with many protrusions that are not smooth, and its nature is hard as stone. Etymologically, there is no record. In short, the origin of this character, in both Chinese and Western traditions, is rooted in both pictographic and semantic elements, although one emphasizes form and the other emphasizes action. Fortunately, this matter is not of great significance; the main question remains: What is called cancer? The new medical view on this is:</p>
<p>Cancer is a new cell tissue that originates from the transition of original, identical cells, but its nature is completely different, and it possesses an independent life force. This type of cell tissue does not proliferate when the various tissues in the human body maintain a balanced force in their development. Once it arises, the equilibrium of the body is destroyed, and the new growth develops independently and unrestrained. The resulting impact is the qualitative, quantitative, and functional deficiency of the cell tissue from which any type of cancer originates, along with other associated implications. This is what causes the patient's illness. Simply put, cancer is a new growth. The essence of this new growth is any type of epithelial cell line tissue in the human body. Under certain circumstances, it loses its normal way of life and goes astray. It not only ruins itself, but also corrupts other neighbors close to it. Furthermore, it can use the convenience of transportation routes to move to more distant areas, reproduce, and make the places it reaches its victims, turning them into its own kind. For the sake of their life progress, it is an obstacle to the health of the body, so various functions gradually disappear, forming an incurable pathological state. Let's use national political situation as a comparison! The nature of cancer is equivalent to the bandits in our country who were heavily suppressed several years ago and are still being sporadically suppressed now. They were also good citizens, but one day they became abnormal and lost their original nature and function, becoming a harmful and useless group of elements, diminishing the country's vitality and forming the country's disease. The only difference here is that the emergence of bandits has a cause that can be found, and if corrected, they can still return to their original nature and become useful members of the country again. On the cancer side, the cause of its emergence is still an unproven theory, and once it starts, trying to restore it is an extremely rare occurrence (only the possibility of self-destruction). Perhaps there will be a possible day in the future!</p>
<p>Since the definition (hypothetical) of cancer is as described above, what we need to know next, of course, is the morphology and organization of cancer itself. Cancer that is located on the surface of the skin often appears as nodules, which ulcerate after a long time; some appear as nipple-like tumors. Cancer in internal organs is often found as infiltration and nodular giant nuclei. Pathological histology tells us that the main component of cancerous tumors is, of course, cancer cells. They gather in one place, interspersed with connective tissue to provide nutrients. The morphology and properties of cancer cells are not unique. The difference between them and the cells in their original location is that they are smaller and less regular. The most important point is still the morphology of the cell nucleus, the reduction of nucleolus, and the darkening of staining. Abnormal methods of nuclear decomposition. The overall structure of a cancerous tumor often strongly imitates the organizational appearance of its place of origin. In terms of physiology, it also relies on aerobic nutrition. In addition, there is another type of fermentation ability discovered by Warburg. It can decompose glucose into lactic acid. This effect is called glucose decomposition, or Glucolysis. The growth ability of cancer cells is very strong, developing simultaneously in three dimensions. However, the speed of onset is inversely proportional to the health of the human body. That is to say, if a strong person develops a cancerous tumor, the malignant onset of this cancerous tumor will definitely be slow; conversely, it will proceed rapidly. Cancer cells can sometimes degenerate on their own and be eliminated. Therefore, cancer patients sometimes have the possibility of spontaneous recovery after onset. There are many types of cancer, which need not be described in detail. They can be simply divided into two major categories: adenocarcinoma and epithelial carcinoma. After briefly outlining the anatomical physiology and living conditions of cancerous tumors, we naturally need to know its causes, or the so-called pathogenesis. That is to say, for what reason do epithelial cell line tissues or organs in the body become cancerous tumors? This is an extremely difficult question to answer. If someone could, and his answer could be generally accepted, then this person would immediately become a world-renowned scholar and a wealthy man. Because for this public case, countless public and private institutions and individuals have offered heavy rewards to solve this problem. Our national government also offered a reward for Sun Yat-sen's liver cancer, announcing to the people to apprehend the murderer. But he flew away into the dark, not knowing where he was hiding, and there were no clues. Regarding this question, the existing theories, which I will now parrot, are roughly three: one is</p>

<p>the bacterial theory, one is the parasitic organism theory, and one is the stimulation theory. The obvious fact is that the formation of cancerous tumors is not a one-sided motive; it must have two conditions to trigger it. One is the static cause, which is what we call the constitution, or Disposition, and the other is the dynamic cause, which is the various things I am now talking about.</p>
<p>In the heyday of bacteriology, all diseases were blamed on bacteria. Cancer was naturally no exception. Many people tried to find a bacterium to be considered the pathogen of cancer. But the results were all disappointing. In fact, no special bacterium can be found that, like other infectious diseases, has all the necessary conditions of a pathogen, such as culture, inoculation, artificial pathogenicity, and so on. In this work, countless efforts were wasted, but no unique object of cancer was found. What was mostly obtained were the appendages within the cancerous tumor ulcer, the products of so-called secondary infection, or Sekundart Infektion. In this situation, some people have argued that these bacteria belong to the category of filterable ones. The British doctor Gye:Banard published an article in the Lancet magazine saying that cancer is an infectious disease caused by a certain filterable bacterium, or, to be more cautious, a virus. He had used ultraviolet light to take pictures, but it was not generally recognized, because there are many types of cancer, and what he used to conduct experiments and as a strong basis for this theory was</p>
<h3>Overview of the Dingxian Rural Women's Training Class</h3>
<p>— Yuheng</p>
<p>In order to promote hygiene to rural families and to make farmers' family life hygienic, the Hygiene Department of the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement has specially opened a rural women's training class. The training courses focus on hygiene, and also include subjects such as drawing and art, animal husbandry, and home industry, so that in the future, they can return to various villages to assist in the initial women's work of rural construction.</p>
<p>The method of recruiting students for the class is to use a selection method, stipulating two to four students per village. Villages with health workers and demonstration villages have priority. The age limit is 20 to 25 years old, but married women have a priority to be selected. Because the Pingjiao Hui's work in Dingxian has gained the approval of the people, many people have signed up. Due to the limited number of places, only 40 students have been selected, and they have all entered the class for training on the 3rd. All expenses are provided by Pingjiao Hui.</p>
<p>The students in the class all come from rural areas, and their levels vary. Some have graduated from civilian schools, some have graduated from senior civilian schools, and some have even studied in the second grade of junior high school. There were some difficulties in the initial management aspect, but now they have been completely trained well. The students are all working hard to explore, feel that hygiene is very important, and have developed a strong interest in it. The arrangement of various courses is quite in line with the principles of hygiene, and the content of the courses meets the needs of the students. The courses taught every day are common sense, history, law, hygiene, gardening, animal husbandry, home industry, and entertainment. Every evening, the tutor-student method is also used to teach literacy and report on current events. The class has many courses, but life is completely based on hygiene principles. Various hygiene habits have also been developed in this shortest period of time. It is now divided into four groups, which are adjusted every day.</p>
<p>Nursing Group—Correcting shortcomings, nursing</p>
<p>Cleaning Group—Sprinkling ladders and cleaning the environment</p>
<p>Handicraft Group—Cotton thread production</p>
<p>Cooking Group—Meals</p>
<p>Each group has teachers who live with the students, are full of energy, have good order, and work in an orderly manner. The six weeks of training will surely benefit the rural areas in the future. I have recorded it in detail to tell the people of the country, hoping that our hygiene community will rise up and do it.</p>
<h3>Chemical Relationship of Nerve Action</h3>
<p>— Shengtao</p>
<p>The Committee of Professors of the Caroline Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, has determined that the winners of this year's (1936) Robert Prize for Physiology and Medicine should be Sir Henry Hallett-Dale of London, England, and Otto Logi of Graz, Austria. The achievement of the two men's joint research is the chemical relationship of nerve action.</p>
<p>The beating of our heart sometimes fast and sometimes slow, is controlled by two nerves. One, the sympathetic nerve, which we all know, can be called a "heart whip" and creates a "whee" sound, which is the driving force that makes the heart beat rapidly. But when the heart beats, it also emits an opposite "halt" sound, which is controlled by the vagus nerve. It is from these two nerves that the process of rapid leaping and melancholy, cheers and depression, in the beating of the heart is created. The sympathetic and vagus nerves are indeed the masters of this process.</p>
<p>What kind of divine power do these two nerves have to make the heart emit "whee" and "halt" sounds? Electricity, a kind of radiating force in the mysterious life process, or chemical relationship? In the past, physiologists and physicians all regarded it as an unsolvable mystery!</p>
<p>Professor Nowi's invention states that the action of the above two nerves is due to the fact that these nerves can secrete a chemical substance directly to the heart. Professor Nowi's conclusion is based on his detailed research in the laboratory. Professor Nowi's experiment was to dissect a frog and expose its heart, and stimulate the vagus nerve of the frog. Then the frog's heart beat gradually slowed down. Then, Professor Nowi transferred the fluid discharged by the frog's heart after the vagus nerve was stimulated to another frog's heart, and the heart of the latter frog immediately slowed down. Professor Nowi's merit in winning the Robert Prize lies only in this. However, this seemingly unimportant scientific observation has extremely important significance. After the vagus nerve of the frog is stimulated, the fluid discharged from its heart must contain a certain substance, and its action is equal to the vagus nerve itself. Thus, the mystery of nerve action has been revealed. The certain substance contained in the fluid is the neurohormone. Thus, neurochemistry, brain chemistry, thought chemistry, and sensation chemistry are established.</p>
<p>The success of this experiment was actually years ago. When a reporter from the Vienna News interviewed Professor Nowi, the professor claimed:</p>
<p>I have served at the University of Graz for twenty-six years. The completion of this research and its experiments was actually years ago. Frankly speaking, I did not imagine that this work would be favored by the Committee of Professors of the Caroline Institute in the Swedish capital and be awarded a prize. In any case, in addition to rejoicing, I will definitely continue to work harder and continue my research. The professor is now sixty-two years old!</p>
<p>After the success of this experiment, researchers studying neurohormones have spread to scientific research institutions all over the world. Recently, it has even been possible to accurately calculate the chemical composition of nerve stimulating substances: about 0.000006 cm per thousandth.</p>
<p>There is no end to scientific research. Today, Professor Nowi's achievements are only the beginning of research into neuroendocrinology. A thorough understanding of this subject still requires the continued efforts of future scientists!</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Hygiene for Diseases of the Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Throat</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(115) Eustachian Tube</p>
<p>The Eustachian tube, also known as the auditory tube, or ear canal, is a trumpet-shaped tubular structure. One end opens into the anterior wall of the tympanic cavity of the middle ear, called the tympanic orifice. One end opens into the pharynx, called the pharyngeal orifice. The total length of the Eustachian tube is about 3.5 centimeters. The proximal third (about 1 cm long) is made of bone, while the rest (about 2.5 cm long) is made of cartilage and membranous tissue. The boundary between the cartilaginous and membranous part and the bony part is the narrowest point, called the Eustachian tube isthmus. The outer wall of the Eustachian tube is attached to the tensor veli palatini muscle. When this muscle contracts, the lumen of the Eustachian tube can be opened, allowing external air to enter the tympanic cavity. Also, the levator veli palatini muscle is attached to the base and inner wall of the cartilage. When this muscle contracts, it can also assist in opening the Eustachian tube. The cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube gradually widens from the isthmus, forming a trumpet shape, which is why the Eustachian tube has the unique name "ear trumpet." Once the Eustachian tube becomes narrow or blocked, symptoms such as hearing difficulty and tinnitus can be felt.</p>
<p>(116) Eustachian Tube Stenosis and Blockage</p>
<p>Eustachian tube stenosis and blockage often occur in (1) rhinitis (often suffering from nasal obstruction, resulting in insufficient ventilation of the nasopharynx and reduced air pressure, followed by hyperemia of the nasopharyngeal and Eustachian tube mucosa), (2) paranasal sinus empyema (due to the stimulation of purulent fluid flowing into the nasopharynx, the nasopharyngeal mucosa often falls into an inflammatory state, and the Eustachian tube cavity is thus narrowed), (3) pharyngitis, (4) adenoid hyperplasia, (5) palatine tonsillitis, and (6) palatine tonsil hypertrophy.</p>
<p>The main symptoms of this condition are that the patient feels hearing difficulty, tinnitus, fullness in the ear, and dizziness, etc. In addition, this condition has a unique point: the patient's hearing is often temporarily improved after swallowing, yawning, and sneezing. If an otoscope is used for examination, it is a characteristic of this condition. Sometimes, the horizontal line of liquid accumulated in the tympanic cavity can be observed, which can move with the patient's head position (maintaining the relationship of the horizontal plane).</p>
<p>The treatment method for this condition should focus on treating the cause. For example, patients with rhinitis, paranasal sinus empyema, pharyngitis, or palatine tonsillitis should be treated as soon as possible. As for those with adenoid hyperplasia or palatine tonsil hypertrophy, it is especially advisable to perform resection as early as possible. At the same time, using Eustachian tube ventilation often has significant effects.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Tooth Decay and Life</h3>
<p>— Ren Junming</p>
<p>After our baby teeth are replaced by adult teeth, we should have a total of 32 teeth. Because there are so many and they are used seamlessly, the chances of collapse and erosion gradually increase. The oral cavity is the only channel for food intake. Bacteria enter through food and reside in the gaps between teeth and the gums, often as many as twenty or more species. Other food residues and meat scraps remain in the remote parts of the teeth. If they are not wiped clean, they will mix with bacteria and carry out their decay work. In the beginning, it undergoes fermentation to form a liquid called lactic acid. The enamel, the outermost layer of the teeth, collapses after prolonged immersion in lactic acid. Bacteria proceed with decay from the already collapsed small holes, gradually expanding. In a few months, it even penetrates the enamel and reaches the dentin. Because the hardness of the dentin is less than that of the enamel, the degree of decay is also faster. Unclean objects block the hole, accumulating more and more over time, and the temperature inside the hole is also higher than outside the hole. The proliferation of bacteria thus becomes more frequent, the decay becomes more intense, and the collapsed cavity expands even more. In the dentin, some dental tubules that are susceptible to bacterial and lactic acid attacks gradually dissolve and split, and the delicate nerve fibers in the dental tubules are stimulated, causing soreness and pain, and then necrosis. However, this is only a part of the symptoms of decay and pain. When the soreness begins, the pulp in the tooth is still alive. If proper treatment is applied at this time, removing the decayed material, killing the bacteria, soothing the living pulp, and then restoring it with a suitable filling material, it will be no different from a healthy tooth.</p>
<p>If you do not follow the above method and fill it in time, the bacteria will advance deeper, penetrating the dentin and directly into the pulp cavity. The pulp cavity is located in the center of the tooth, where the pulp is stored. At this time, the pulp is exposed and has no protection. Any cold or hot air, and all soft and hard substances, will cause excruciating pain when touched. Even if it is not touched, the pulp has been revealed and infected by bacteria, it will inevitably become inflamed and painful. At this time, if you go to the dentist, use medicine to kill the pulp, reduce inflammation, remove dirt, detoxify, draw out the pulp completely, fill the root canal, and repair the crown, not only will you be spared from pain and disease in the future, but its chewing function will also be no different from a healthy tooth.</p>
<p>If, by the time of the above period, you are still unaware of treatment, allowing the decay to progress, the pulp cannot withstand the infection of bacteria and poisons, and it becomes highly inflamed, congested to death. Its remains remain in the pulp cavity, mixed with other decaying substances, and then become putrid and purulent, advancing along the root canal to become pulp gangrene. At the same time, the periodontal membrane is also infected, causing congestion and pain, and the diseased tooth floats. It often affects the gums to become inflamed, spreading to the cheeks. Muscles and nerves are stimulated and compressed at the same time, causing pain and swelling. Sometimes, fortunately, the body's resistance to leukemia is strong, and it can control the progress of the disease and gradually recover. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon. Although the symptoms seem to be relieved, the progress of the disease has not stopped. At this time, the root-end periodontal disease may become chronic suppurative inflammation, such as root-end abscess, periodontal suppuration, and alveolar pyorrhea. Dr. Mayo, an American dentist, said that this type of chronic dental disease can cause more than 150 kinds of serious diseases throughout the body and pose a direct danger to life. The most common ones are caused by chronic dental infections, such as appendicitis, gastric ulcer, endocarditis, kidney disease, lung disease, neurological disorders, ophthalmia, and arthritis.</p>
<p>Those who are unfortunate enough to turn into acute giant patients, such as osteomyelitis, osteomyelitis, and alveolar abscesses, can even lead to septicemia and death.</p>
<p>People often regard tooth decay and pain as a minor disease, neglecting to seek medical treatment, thinking that it is not important to health and life. In fact, it is a big mistake. When acute and chronic diseases become deeper day by day and the immune function gradually weakens, life is in danger. It is pitiful and regrettable.</p>
<p>The above is only based on popular propaganda. Other detailed descriptions will be discussed in the next issue.</p>

<h3>Expanding the Puppet Organization in Eastern Hebei</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>According to news from Tianjin yesterday, a certain party is plotting to expand the puppet organization in Eastern Hebei and establish a communist prevention government. At present, a certain special agency in Tianjin is actively promoting it, with traitors Cheng Guorui, Yang Rongzhai, Zhao Wenjun, etc. as leaders. Their plan is to sabotage transportation, claiming that it was done by the communist bandits. Although this plan is extremely vicious, they have been using vicious means for a long time, so it seems commonplace and not surprising. However, the Hebei authorities should deal with it carefully.</p>
<p>A certain party originally demanded autonomy for five provinces. Because our side refused, the goal was not achieved, so the price was greatly reduced, and it was changed to the demand for autonomy for Hebei and Chahar. However, the asking price was too extravagant, and our side could not agree. We had no choice but to come up with various destructive policies and cruel behaviors in order to achieve its fixed goals. Now that this conspiracy has been discovered by our side, we should take measures to strictly prevent it, use force to stop it, and it is difficult to tolerate it any longer.</p>
<p>For example, in Chahar, why was it unknowingly completely occupied by foreign forces, so that Suiyuan has been frequently alarming? During the Bailingmiao incident last year, I don't know how many heads were spent and how many hand-to-hand combats were fought before we could take it back, and the extremely important commercial capital in eastern Sui is still in the hands of bandits and puppets. It is really easy to lose and difficult to get. Don't say that the disease of the limbs has not yet reached the heart.</p>
<p>Now, in eastern Hebei, a certain party is actively expanding the puppet organization. Where is Hebei Province? What is the name of the puppet organization? If we continue to tolerate it and let it act freely, then the disease of the heart will have been formed. No matter whether they still want to expand or promote, even if they do not expand or promote, the current organization that is neither donkey nor horse is shocking and frightening. If such a place is not prepared in advance and corrected severely, the future will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>The other day, after our side seized a certain party's special agency in Zhengzhou, we found many secret documents, ㊀ planning the independence of counties north of the Yellow River in Henan Province, ㊁ colluding with bandits and local militia to riot, ㊂ compiling reactionary slogans to incite the public, ㊃ carrying out espionage work, and ㊄ organizing special radio classes. This kind of cruel and secret behavior has been discovered everywhere. If this kind of conspiracy is not severely punished, it will inevitably cause trouble everywhere, and there will be the same organization everywhere. As the saying goes, "Treading on dew means hard ice will arrive," and "A trickle not stopped will become a river." This kind of cruel behavior cannot be dealt with without cruel means.</p>
<h3>Five Blessings Arrive</h3>
<p>— Daxiao</p>
<p>The incredible story of "five daughters born at once" in Ontario, Canada, once caused a sensation around the world. These five little rascals had already learned to walk in January of the year before last, and last year, they were able to dance and play games. This is truly commendable!</p>
<p>These five happy children are often cared for by a special doctor to make their lives completely hygienic; and pay attention to the calcium and vitamin D content in their food. Because calcium and vitamin D are important raw materials for teeth and bones, and are especially needed by developing children. So some children have poor bone quality and tooth decay because of calcium deficiency!</p>
<p>"Jiale Calcium" chocolate candy is a new product of our country's Wuzhou Pharmacy. The taste is no different from ordinary chocolate candy, but it is rich in calcium and vitamin D. Children often eat it to make their bones develop well and create a lifelong health foundation.</p>
<h3>Wife</h3>
<p>— Wang Muxin</p>
<p>Recently, my wife's spirits have been very happy, and her complexion has become ruddy.</p>
<p>I remember in the past, my wife often had a melancholy look, her body was weak, her nerves were on edge, and she would often argue with me over trivial matters. Although she would regret it afterward and cry, she would soon be arguing with me again!</p>
<p>Seeing my wife in this state, I suspected that she must be ill. After careful questioning, I found out that she was suffering from "dysmenorrhea." Then I understood that her depression and irritability were due to this condition.</p>
<p>Now, she has been taking "Monthly Red" for two months, and her illness has completely disappeared. Her body is getting healthier day by day. In addition to being happy, I am also grateful to the Wuzhou Pharmacy for this.</p>
<h3>After Watching Huang Bochang's Wrestling</h3>
<p>— Yin Fei</p>
<p>I went to see professional wrestler Mr. Huang Bochang's first match in Shanghai. The performance was very exciting, making people feel a sense of cruelty and involuntarily clenching their fists with sweaty palms. The atmosphere that day was not very lively, and Chinese spectators accounted for only about 10%. I suppose this is because Chinese performances in this area often fail.</p>
<p>Later, the situation was different. I heard from friends who had seen the show that many Chinese people were watching. I also saw in the newspapers a news story about a lady presenting a robe before the match. I guess that was because Mr. Huang Bochang had won. Feeling "proud and honored," she went to "raise her eyebrows and exhale." Later, because he was "always victorious," naturally more people went to "raise their eyebrows and exhale." Of course, there were also regular patrons who went out of concern. Some went to watch the spectacle because they heard it was exciting and intense, but there was also an element of patriotism at play. If Huang Bochang had failed the first time, even if it were more exciting and intense, I don't think so many compatriots would have gone to watch.</p>
<p>Recently, several newspapers have said that the match was fake and have used this as a basis to discuss the issue of "professional" versus "amateur." Whether it is fake or not, I, as an outsider, cannot tell, and that is not what this short article wants to talk about. As for the issue of "professional" versus "amateur," I have paid too little attention to sports and have no research, so I naturally cannot talk about it. What I want to talk about are some other trivial thoughts.</p>
<p>I remember that after the news of the Chinese athletes' complete defeat at the World Games came back, there was an "uproar of public opinion." The so-called "public opinion" here does not only refer to newspapers and magazines, but also includes the conversations of friends during tea breaks. The reasons for the "uproar" can be roughly divided into two types. The first is that it was said that not only was a huge amount of money spent, but China's reputation was also lost. The latter says exactly the opposite, saying that losing face is secondary, because this was expected. What is most regrettable is the waste of so much money. If this funding were used to build a good cause in the country, it would be more practical and beneficial. Although there are two types of "uproar," there is only one reason: because they returned completely defeated. If they had scored a little, I don't think the "public sentiment" would have been so intense.</p>
<p>This time, Mr. Huang Bochang's performance in Shanghai is exactly the opposite of the World Games. He is a "victorious general." Because he is a "victorious general," the number of Chinese spectators who felt "proud and honored" gradually increased.</p>
<p>Some people say that the audience's love of wrestling is due to "barbaric heredity." One newspaper translated an article by American professional wrestler Jackson, in which he said, "These many civilized audiences also have a barbaric heredity. The more brutal the match, the more bloody and terrifying it is, the more the audience is attracted. Those women who are called lovers of tenderness are even more fascinated than men."</p>
<p>This statement may have its reasons, but it is not a very good reason. For example, when I watch this cruel game, I do feel that the more brutal, the better, but there is a limit to this. That is, the brutality must belong to those with whom you sympathize. So, when Huang was being held by the opponent, this "brutality" aroused my cruel feelings. The same feeling exists when watching ball games. When the team we sympathize with loses, we always feel uncomfortable. The origin of this sympathy can almost be said to be innate. Even if forced, it cannot be changed. The more forceful, the deeper the aversion. And strangely, sympathizers seem to be in groups. In the ballpark, no one "orders" or "subsidizes," but those who sympathize with a certain team often naturally make up the majority, and the remaining opponents are mostly because they have some vested interest with the other party.</p>
<p>Huang Bochang makes us sympathize because he is Chinese; and the Chinese audience watching his performance has increased because he is "always victorious" and they feel that he is "winning honor for the country." This lesson is very worthy of our attention, and there are many examples, such as the resistance against the enemy in Suiyuan.</p>
<p>Please cherish this "sympathy," and please make good use of this "sympathy." Lastly, I want to warn everyone.</p>
<h3>Overseas People</h3>
<p>— Jin Ge</p>
<p>Old Guang aimlessly wandered the streets, hoping to run into a newcomer (Note 1) or a fellow villager (Note 2), to bum some money for a temporary meal.</p>
<p>Old Guang was just released from prison yesterday. While in jail, he didn't have to worry about meals. Once released, he suddenly didn't even have food to eat. Fortunately, he met a newcomer yesterday and conned him out of dinner. Today is harder.</p>
<p>"Let's go to the employment agency and try our luck." He suddenly thought of this place. His heart seemed to have some hope. The entrance to the employment agency was crowded with people. Dark and dense, it felt suffocating. The sign at the door was tilted upward, and the white lettering was covered with a thick layer of grease.</p>
<p>"Damn it, it's too crowded!" Old Guang cursed in his native dialect.</p>
<p>He tried hard to squeeze in, but was pushed back out.</p>
<p>"Damn it, I don't want to squeeze anymore. Even if I get in, I still won't have food to eat!"</p>
<p>He turned around and was about to walk away when he unexpectedly saw Lao Hua, a fellow villager he hadn't seen in years. He hurried over and grabbed his wrist, acting very friendly. In reality, they were all broke, so who would put on airs!</p>
<p>"Lao Hua, long time no see, are you rich?"</p>
<p>"You're rich!" Lao Hua was insulted by Lao Guang's asking if he was rich.</p>
<p>"If I were rich, would I be here? What have you been doing lately? How's it going?"</p>
<p>"If things were going well, I wouldn't be here!" The two laughed miserably.</p>
<p>"What! You still want to squeeze in?"...</p>
<p>Lao Hua broke free from Lao Guang's hand and tried hard to squeeze in, but Lao Guang pulled him back.</p>
<p>"I'm trying my luck!"</p>
<p>"Don't be delusional! Look! So many people, can you even squeeze in? Even if you squeeze in, those foreign devils (Note 3) there, will they register you? If they register you, will you have food to eat?"</p>
<p>"Ha! The foreign devils don't even have food to eat, let alone the Chinese (Note 4)!" He sighed.</p>
<p>"Let's go, let's go for 'six weeks' instead!"</p>
<p>Old Guang pulled Lao Hua, not allowing him to refuse, and dragged him away.</p>
<p>"Okay! Anyway, I don't have food to eat!"</p>
<p>Lao Hua made up his mind and followed Old Guang.</p>
<p>The winter wind kept blowing against them, making their bodies shiver uncontrollably. Their stomachs were rumbling. They walked to the train station and, when the police weren't around, sneaked onto the platform and managed to get into the train car. The two were now somewhat at ease.</p>
<p>The slow train started. The yellow fields were rapidly receding behind them. The winter wind in the wilderness blew even harder, but it couldn't reach them.</p>
<p>One station, two stations, they had already sneaked through three stations.</p>
<p>"Lao Guang: It's not good, the ticket collector is coming!" Lao Hua looked very panicked.</p>
<p>"What are you afraid of? We'll just get off!" Old Guang was quite calm.</p>
<p>So, at the fourth station, they were kicked off the train.</p>
<p>"Lao Hua! We've never been here before!"</p>
<p>"Good! Let's stay here!"</p>
<p>The two, like ghosts, ventured into the bustling street. The shops were all decorated with New Year's red lanterns, red and green, dazzling!</p>
<p>"Hey! There's a policeman ahead... time to act."</p>
<p>The police whistle sounded. A small commotion broke out on the street. Two policemen grabbed them by the collars and took them to the new guest office.</p>
<p>"Lao Guang, time to eat 'six weeks' worth of free food!"</p>
<p>Note 1: "Newcomer" is a Cantonese term for a newly arrived person, with a derogatory meaning.</p>
<p>Note 2: "Fellow villager" is what Cantonese people call people from the same village.</p>
<p>Note 3: "Foreign devil" is what overseas Chinese call Americans, sometimes they also call them "Foreign people."</p>
<p>Note 4: "Chinese" is what Chinese in America often call themselves.</p>
<h3>After the Market Closed</h3>
<p>— A Min</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Shanghai Poor People's Shelter (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Li Caihua</p>
<p>To learn about the situation of the poor people's shelter and the lives of the poor inside, I made a visit to the Chao Hui Wu Yi Villa at the South Railway Station the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Upon entering, I saw many reed mat sheds with signs saying "No Smoking." I explained my intentions to a person standing at the gate wearing a white cloth symbol, and they led us to the general affairs office. The administrator of the general affairs office, Mr. Jiang, immediately introduced the head foreman, Mr. Chen, to show us around. After the tour, I asked the following questions:</p>
<p>"How many years has your shelter been in operation?"</p>
<p>"This is the eighth year."</p>
<p>"Are there any procedures for the poor to enter and leave the shelter?"</p>
<p>"The procedure is very simple. Upon entering the shelter, first, we check for flammable materials (such as lighters); second, we register their name, age, and origin; third, we distribute clothes and blankets; fourth, we shave their heads; and fifth, we assign them to a class for formal shelter life. As for leaving the shelter, we have four methods: those who are young and strong but unemployed are sent to the vagrant vocational training center; the elderly are sent to the nursing home; those with family members are allowed to be taken away by their families; and those who have no money to return home are sent back with travel expenses."</p>
<p>"Where do the poor people in your shelter come from? How many people are there now?"</p>
<p>"The sources of the poor can be divided into three categories: one is that they come on their own, two is that they are sent by the Social Bureau, and three is that they are sent by the Public Security Bureau, with the most coming on their own. There are currently 1,400 poor people, about 1,000 adults and about 400 children. The oldest is an old man in his seventies, and the youngest is a six-year-old child. Most are between twenty and forty years old."</p>
<p>"Are there any restrictions on who your shelter takes in?"</p>
<p>"We do not refuse anyone."</p>
<p>"But what happens when the number of people exceeds the capacity? Doesn't the cost also exceed the budget?"</p>
<p>"When the number of people is too crowded, we can arrange for them to go to the second shelter. If the second shelter is also crowded, we can set up a third, fourth... Fortunately, there is no rent. As for the funding, we were originally struggling to find it. Most of the funding comes from the help of philanthropists and government subsidies. Now, of course, we are still constantly raising donations from the outside world. We spend an average of two dimes per poor person per day (including food, water, medicine, etc.). If we calculate with 1,400 people, then it costs about 280 yuan per day, and each term costs 30,000 to 40,000 yuan."</p>
<p>"When does your shelter start accepting people each year? When does it end?"</p>
<p>"We start about ten days before the winter solstice and end about ten days after the Qingming Festival in the following year."</p>

I don't even feel like drinking camellia. Helpless, I swallow opium to numb the pain. In the spring silk curtain, I long to sleep. The tuberose scented dream carries drowsiness. I lazily apply hibiscus powder to my face. I have no desire to choose hairpins of gold finches. I feel cold even when draped in mallow. I constantly tie my willow waist with a pomegranate skirt. In the evening, my stomach full of plantain, I can't sleep soundly. The cuckoo sings on the branch at the third watch. I have become, a tender begonia, weak and tired. I must pray to the Guanyin Bodhisattva seated on the lotus flower. May she protect me, so that I may be relieved of illness and gain longevity. May I pass through the winter solstice and enter the new year. May I inform my loving mother of my filial piety. The flowers are gold and silver, my wishes are fulfilled. The Buddha smiles and my sincerity reaches the gods. I will not be, like a frivolous peach blossom, drifting with the current. I want to cultivate the Tao and enjoy eternal spring. The ten sisters have completed their marriage rituals, but I, a jasmine, do not wish to be tainted by the mundane world. One must know that the peony boasts of wealth and honor, but several butterfly dreams are not real. What is said about the crape myrtle lover, gentle and refined, what is said about the lotus, ordinary and beautiful. No matter if you are a magnolia or a golden phoenix guest, you are all people of the reed catkin gathering. Pearl vines also represent empty fame.</p>

<p>Opening: "Liu Yi"</p>
<p>Peach blossoms are like embroidery, willow trees are like gold. Zhang Xu invited Liu Yi to travel. Both are talented and handsome. They are classmates and from the same village. They went to the countryside together to find poetic inspiration. Strolling leisurely near the seashore. He saw a shepherdess with a look of sorrow. Shyly hiding from people. Her clothes were not like those of an ordinary woman. A kind of charm and beauty that is exquisite. He asked the beautiful lady about her family. Why not try to tell me her life? Her beauty is not like that of a shepherdess. She modestly lowered her eyes and spoke softly. Her soft words were like an oriole coming out of a valley. I am seeking a messenger for my father's anger today. The rhino horn on my head can be used as proof. The big tree by the river can be the door. As he pointed and said, there was indeed a shade under the big tree by the river. He gently knocked several times. Little did he know that this horn was a rhino horn. In an instant, it could separate the sea water. A crystal palace and a lapis lazuli throne. He paid respect to the man sitting on the throne with his crown. The emperor was frightened and angered. Since this is the case, how can I tolerate it? Discussing marriage does not hinder the separation between the dark and the secluded. The crocodile drums sound in harmony and joy. Entering the Dragon Palace before Dongting Lake.</p>

It is reported that the director team for this time is still the original team from "Sai Jinhua," with the addition of makeup expert Mr. Xin Hanwen. The cast has also been largely decided. It is rumored that Ms. Li Lilian will play the role of Qiu Jin. Regarding the issue of extras, the performance committee has decided not to hire them as a principle.</p>

<p>The song on the right is an interlude from the new movie "Lively and Vigorous" directed by Xu Xinfu and starring Gu Lanjun, Gu Meijun, Gong Jianong, Wang Zhengxin, and You Guangzhao. The song's melody and rhythm preserve the pure Chinese flavor, with smooth transitions and extremely pleasant to the ear. The accompanying instruments are also purely Chinese instruments, such as the "Gu Se," "Qin Qin," "Yangqin," "Pipa," "Xiqin," and "Transverse Flute," etc. The musicians are more than ten members of the Midnight Music Concert led by the song's composer, Xu Ruhui.</p>

<h3>Fire! Fire!</h3>
<p>A Scene from "New Year's Money"</p>
<p>"New Year's Money" writes about the story of a silver dollar used as New Year's money. In this story, the silver dollar is thrown into a garbage can, and then the following fire story is produced.</p>
<p>Among the three children collecting garbage, one named Xiao Sanzi picked up the shiny silver dollar. He jumped up with joy, threw it on the ground, and the sound was good. He put it in his arms and walked away. Two other children chased after him, asking to take a look, but Xiao Sanzi kept running away.</p>
<p>Near a row of shantytowns, Xiao Sanzi ran over, followed by many people shouting:</p>
<p>"Xiao Sanzi got a big silver coin!" Xiao Sanzi got rich! "Xiao Sanzi made a fortune!"</p>
<p>The slum was in chaos because of this sound. Many people came out of the shantytowns, chickens flew, dogs barked, children cried, and women wailed.</p>
<p>Xiao Sanzi handed the silver dollar to his mother, and everyone was surprised and happy. The family was crowded with hundreds of people. They were cooking, and the stove was overturned. The fire started, everyone shouted, everyone ran, Xiao Sanzi's parents all ran, fell in panic, and the silver dollar fell on the ground.</p>
<p>Fire! Fire! Fire! The houses collapsed, fierce fire, smoke, shouts, and burning sounds.</p>
<p>When "New Year's Money" was filming this scene, the Mingxing open-air studio was suddenly filled with fire, making it very dangerous.</p>
