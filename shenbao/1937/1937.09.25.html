<h3>蔣委員長對外報記者談中國抵抗能力無限</h3>
<p>戰爭時期之久暫平視日本及列强之態度　各國應遵守義務不能來親一切條約撕毀</p>

<p>［南京］行政院院長兼軍事委員會委員長蔣介石、今日接見外國新聞記者、對於日機轟炸南京、發表談話稱、中國首都之被轟炸於中國之軍事局而並不發生影響、但將使中國之民眾以及全世界之人民更充分了解日本之野蠻、日本之侵略一日不止中國之抵抗亦一日不停、蔣委員畏復稱、彼覺美國現在之態度、並非其眞實之態度、被深信美國朝野素來尊重公道法律與秩序、並信中美兩國之友誼有悠久之歷史、故在此次中國抵抗日本侵略之奮鬥中、必能興中國以同情及援助云、今日蔣委員長於一大廳中、接見外國新聞記者、委員長精神飽滿、面帶笑容、衣黃色中山製、坐於室中一角之大寫字檯援、外國記者列坐其飾環繞作半圓形、委員長夫人御黑色長袍、坐於委員長之右為委員長作翻譯、談話完畢援、蔣委員長夫婦復允記者之請、任各記看攝影、委員長未婦對於各記溝親冒日機轟擊之危險來京探訪新聞、極為讚賞、並對於中國此次抗戰期中、世界各同報紙記載翔實而充滿同情、極為感謝、關於美闕之態度、委員長稱、中國此次抗戰、不僅在中國本身之存亡、且亦卽為九國公約及國聯盟約伸正義、因此公約及盟約之簽字國、應對於中國之奮鬥加以援助、在公約及盟約等有效期問、美國不應考盧中立法云、委員長繼復稱、美國不能守中立、余信各簽字國家之人民及政府亦未忘卻其義務、”有詢以運輸軍火來華之片面禁令、及美大使本月二十一日遷入呂米號砲艦辦公之二事者、委員長稱、“余覺余無須加以評論、因美國友人及駐華新聞記者已在此目擊一切、彼等所感覺者、與余必同也”、記者復詢以各國之責任如何、委員長稱、“各簽字國家均應遵守其義務、惟美國為華府會議之召集者、而九國公約及國聯盟約之訂立、胥屬美國之力、故其責任尤為重大”云、委員長繼復對於各國目前之態度表示驚異、因彼等非但放棄共義務、且竟“自處於日本控制之下、坐視被等所簽署之一切條約撕毀無餘”也、記者復詢以中國是否猶希望國聯之援助、委員長謂“公理必佔最後之勝利”、有詢以中日戰爭時期之久暫者、委員長稱、中國抵抗日本之侵略並無時限在日本侵略繼續進行之中、或在九國公約及國聯盟約尚未實施之前、戰爭勢亦不止、中國已不能容許日本軍隊之以壓力加論中闕、故戰爭時期之久暫、全視日本及列强之態度、凡一國家苟不尊重國際間人道之規律者、必不能持久、委員長復稱、日軍企圖毀減江陰方面之防禦工事、俾日本軍艦得上調長江轟擊南京、故派飛機前往轟炸、但結果江陰方面之防禦工事、屹然未動、“不論此次戰爭將延長至何限度、中國已有無限制抵抗之能力、因中國實一威力無窮財力無盡之國家也、日木海岸封鎖或將給與他國極大打擊、但於中國則影響極微”云、（二十四日中央社電）</p>
<h3>九國公約簽字國正在交換意見</h3>
<p>英美接洽尤與密切　暫時尚難召開會議</p>
<p>［華盛頓］日內瓦方面有人建議、召集九國公約簽字國會議、討論中日衝突、國務部今日表示、美國關於此事、已與九國公約簽字國某某數國進行進行討論、惟僅為交換情報、蓋每一事件發生、九國公約關係國卽從事交換意見、但並未實行九國公約所規定之諮詢步驟、據悉、栽與國交換意山最密切、厥為英國、惟國務部與中日二國、亦幾每日必有談話、官方以為正式援引九國公約、未必卽有實效、因該約僅規讓定各國互相𧫎詢、並未規定有召集會議之必要、國務部長赫爾則稱、美國政府對於九國公約之見解、可於八月二十三日國務部之宣言見之、現在無改變云（二十三日國民社電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］官方今日表示、美國甚願與其他對於矯遠東局勢有關各國合作、俾以和平方法解决當前危機、惟亦不願在日內瓦方面所提建議之目的與方法未明暸前、卽作切實之表示、載至現在爲止、他國尚未與美國接洽、故美國亦不願討論假想之問題、有人主張召集國際會議、但未知純粹為九國公約國會議、抑將擴大範圍、以包括蘇俄·德國·澳洲及其他國家·美國於未曾確知會議之性以以前、當特別審愼、有人以為蘇俄參加與否、將爲極重要之問題、因蘇俄對于遠東有重大關系、然茍邀之參加、必將引起日本極度之不滿、若德意兩國亦同時參加、或可減少此種反響、惟亦儘可增加事態之複雜、九國公約並不規定必煩召集會議、僅須簽字國互相諮詢、現在美國早已諮詢中日英三國、其他國家或者亦己進行、據稱、卽使若干國家於九國公約成立之後宣佈遵從者、亦可非正式向之諮詢、國務部長赫爾最近宣佈美國遠束政策時、曾稱、美國擬力避各種聯盟關係、惟亦深信國際間儘可合作、以和平方法達到七月十六日宣言之目的、鈴此可見美國今已準備與他國共同設法、以和平手段調解遠東危局云、（二十三日國民電）</p>

<p>自敵寇滬以來、已四十餘日、不但依然侷處於滬東隅、絕少進展、目屢遭我軍迎頭痛擊、受創甚鉅、其傷亡總額已達二萬左右、故為積極補充、俾便再行大舉進犯計、業已向國內作第四次乞援、而其援軍之一部約八千人、巳於前三日內陸續開來、昨日上午、又續有敵商輪改造之第卅八號運輸艦廣安丸、駛靠大阪碼頭、下午復續有敵商輪改建之第三○六號運輸艦福丸、亦駛靠大阪碼頭、萬光丸駛靠招商局北棧、築後丸駛靠匯山碼頭、西光丸（一七六號）貽久丸（一○三號）駛靠黃浦碼頭、先後共六艘、載來敵又一部援軍約七千人、常卽分別登岸、同時又有大批軍馬運來、總計近日來在滬東區各碼頭登陸之敵援軍、其總數已達一萬五千人左右、而敵此次增援總額為一師團及一旅團、合約四萬人、聞在沿江各處、亦已有一部分登陸云、又訊、敵紅十字艦、Burun　Maru於昨日下午三時駛滬、停靠匯山馬頭、常卽有大批救護藥品卸下、同時另有敵傷兵數百人、抬運上艦、運返日本診治云、</p>

<h3>我軍事發言人駁斥日總領聲明</h3>
<p>妄企圖將滬戰責任諉卸於我　自己早已忘卻違背淞滬恊定</p>
<p>中央社云、日本駐滬總領事岡本、前日向外國記者發表一文、對於滬戰之責任、强自掩飾推卸、我軍事發言人特於昨日發表聲明予以駁斥云、本人對於日本總領事冗長之聲明、企圖將滬戰之责任諉卸於我方、不願多所批駁、惟日總領事之承認佔領八字橋、業已違背二十一年所訂之淞滬恊定矣、日總領事似已忘懷另一違背淞滬恊定之舉動、卽為宮崎水兵失蹤之時、日方指為中國方面所架去、竟派武裝之軍隊侵入閘北、但其後證明宮崎係私自逃遁、日軍司令曾聲明道歉、至於日方對於外國報紙之責難、本人以為此種公然之誣蔑、殊覺無用、</p>
<h3>字林西報撰論嚴斥</h3>
<p>字林報昨載駐滬日總領事岡本所撰一文、洋洋灑灑、不下萬言、歷述導成滬戰之事實、而歸咎於中國違背質言、並責許多外國記者自貶其身分、對於戰訊、作不實之紀載、先發偏見之言論、次辯護日軍以租界為作戰根據地之正當、末言日本非中國人民之仇敵、切願與中國培植至密切之關係、中國人民眞正之仇敵、厥為南京之團體、興其以金錢收買之中外屬從、又言日本不善宜傳、而華人與其以金錢所僱之外國發言人、在日內瓦等處作有害於日本之宣傳、以讕言惑世、此為日人所不屑為者云、記者按中日兩國不幸以干戈相見、是非早有公綸、觀連日世界各大報一致</p>
<p>抨擊日本</p>
<p>是豈全為中國以金錢收買者、岡本卽謂日本不屑在世界各處從事宣傳、則岡本亦何必草此長文、載諸外報、而日政府近决派專使分赴世界各大國游說、又何為者、岡本意中殆以為其國人咸不善宣傳、而彼獨善於宣傳乎、最可嗤者、謂日本非中國人民之仇敵、切願與中國人民培植至密切之關係、中國人民眞正之仇敵、厥為南京之團體云云、幸日本猶切願與中國人民培植至密切之關係、而其飛機連日以大批炸彈餉我平民、此殆培植至密切關係之禮品乎、兩國迄未宣戰、實際猶未絕交、而岡本竟稱我國民政府為團體、其侮辱我政府有如是者、侮辱我政府卽侮辱我全國國民也、世其有願與侮辱政府屠毅毀滅同胞者為友、日我全國人民今已</p>
<p>一致團結</p>
<p>為政府抗戰之後盾、雖素與政府水火之共黨、亦棄其主張、而聴政府指揮、以驅逐暴寇、而岡本猶發此狂囈、何懵懵若是、岡本原文、本擬譯以貢獻讀者、而逐條加以駁斥、第記著不屑浪費光陰、污我筆墨、故僅就其最荒謬之數點、略予筆伐、再中日今卽處於敵對之地位、記者所發言論、或不免被認為私言、總不若第三者之評論、公正而有力、字林西報對岡本之文、亦撰社論、題曰「不能馴服之獸」嚴詞駁斥、特迻譯錄下、足徵正義不沒、是非自有公論、縱狡辯、亦何益哉、</p>
<p>字林報日</p>
<p>岡本先生慘澹經營、證明一切、而為不少人所圖予以否認者、卽中政府在華北為日本無端之侵略所迫、决議政治與軍事之局勢、實不得一面在華北抵抗、一面猛攻上海區城之日軍是、岡本之文中所稱、渠在滬代表日政府於滬戰暴發前數星期中、曾竭力謀使上海免遭戰禍、或亦可予以誠摯贊同、日本陸戰隊事件之嚴厲、曾呈顯明之緩和、可為佐證、且獲上海市政府就其能力所之合作、而予以輔助、情乎岡本令人欲以滬局逐漸增高緊張、及違背淞滬恊定一切過失、咸加諸中國之肩、實完全漠視駐滬之日海軍自一二八以還、</p>
<p>蹂躍上海</p>
<p>公共租界工部局之權力、誇耀駐軍武力之準備、將虹口楊樹浦日漸轉為日本之領土、凡此種種、己成安全之明白威脅、為此安全、經日本許可之保安隊所因以設立者也、近年來本埠發生各種爭案(內有數件簡直可謂為虛無漂渺者)不絕需工部局高級職員之機警完全超出彼等固有旨趣之範闈者以應付之、凡憶及此種事件者、無一能對大局之一種氣象、閉目不顧、此種氣象、在岡本當然不予理會、然實與所關各案之公允佔量至有關係、遠背淞滬恊定之責任、苟非計及以上諸點、尤其為中國方面之辯論、則欲作謹嚴之調整、實不能滿意成功、小國之辯論、卽岡本所堅决信賴的共同委員會之會議、已因非完全在日人控制內之情勢轉為一種機關、重於紀錄日本之抗議、而輕於監視雙方遵守該恊定是也、</p>
<p>岡本縷述</p>
<p>其信賴保持上海和平渠所予合作之效力、曾進至某種程度、日本對此之美意、不能置辯‵岡本日冒重損其職位之危險、而中國軍隊之迅速大增、顯然足形日海軍司令所能調遣之戍軍人數、比數為少、中國保安隊之增援、與其所備之武器、固能視為淞滬恊定技術上之破壤、但日本𪑳武主義頻頻以壓力加諸南京政府、而日人在租界之活動、又足為是項壓力之反映、故謂淞滬恊定簽字時之狀况、已與今日大不相同、實非悖理之論也、質言之、中國無論在上海、在冀東、在北平、已陷於小獸之地位、此獸也、因易遭攻擊、已成</p>
<p>不可馴眼</p>
<p>之獸、而圖自衛矣、岡本關於此事、個人之天良、當然淸明、故「九一八」以還、中國時事之趨勢、迫令日本發言人詳述違背協定問題應出以愼重、而岡本未能鑒及此節、或呵加以原諒、是以述及中國當局注意鞏固其防務之言論、殊易遭評論家之冷遇、葦彼嘗念及上海與華北之日本陸海軍代表恣睢要求、以圖號令中國之人民並日益控制中國之士地也、此種侵追雖東京巧妙之對華新概念、」未能如願發展、然從未稍止前進、實使彼受害者不得不奮死予以抵抗者也、岡本研究本埠之大局、何竟置此根本事實於不顧、</p>
<p>岡本復謂</p>
<p>列强未能召集圓桌會议、讨論上海將來之地位、難辭疏忽之咎、其言或有表同情者、然當知列强除彼等须應付世界之事孌外、咸覺日本政策長此侵略、實無作此討論之機會、·彼等之反對考慮關一不設軍備區也、亦以此故、蓋此舉在一二八攻擊上海之暗影下已確具雛型、而在討論中不得不提起日本在華北不斷的前侵所暗示日本意旨之整個間題、因以不能獲實際之結果也、彼等倘遭遇此種困難、或可有較益於上海、但無人敢為此種行動、可獲結果、尤其因公共租界已努力覓求日本合作、以解决界外築路與檢查工廠問題、</p>
<p>猶遭碰壁</p>
<p>也、岡本明白解說日本為不善寅傳之國、此言也、莫欲與乏爭辯、蓋岡本嘔心挖肝以求直之事件、而損之者、無過於巳住六年中日本在華自己之行動也、岡本竟敢逾越上海事件之範圍、面攻擊南京政府之人員、亦不以公道自處、縱其富於辭藻之責言、或有認之為正當者、（字林報實不敢贊同此見）然當加以質問者、願與中國人民培植至密切關係之友邦、其應以大軍降臨此輩人民之海濱、而任意屠殺破壤、且直謂其出此乃抱更易其領袖之利人的願望、岡本所持强有力之點、且不適合遲輯、蓋彼以中政府之罪惡歸咎於中國民眾缺乏政治或國民之良知、而令負此重大責任、故無怪乎今日在華作戰之日本軍隊於岡本所稱為敵人、與岡本心目中所認為友人之二者、不能明白區別也、（下略）</p>

<h3>英文大美晚報評斥敵方虛偽行為</h3>
<p>言行互相矛盾　曷不率直承認</p>
<p>本市英文大美晚報二十四晚社論、題為「何不光明磊落」、對日人之鬼祟行為、備加譏諷、女日「日本對英大使許閣森爵士受傷照會、延擱已久、其復文僅對許閣森爵士受傷一者表示深切遣憾、而倫教當局已認為滿意、此則吾人置身事外者、不應吹毛求疵、而妄加指摘、綠日英間發生糾紛、固非吾人所願聞、凡事能圓滿解決、究係好事也、惟日本征女中、最感興趣、抑且最爲重要者、厥爲日本保證已訓令在華日軍竭盡全力保障非戰鬥員之安全一點、此項訓令之意義、頗為費解、綠吾人回顧卽往數日及數星期中之紀錄、並未發現日軍會注意中國非戰鬥員之安全、卽彼等外國非戰鬥員、雖深表關切、然各外籍僑民、在鐵路或公路往來旅行或居住南京及廣州等城市者、亦未能因日人之關切、而為之釋然於懷、日人恣意轟炸任伺人之車輛、及非軍事性質之平民居住區域、實與「以極大審愼保障非戰鬥員之安全」一節、互相矛盾、日人之虛偽果何為乎、曷不率直承認此非戰爭而為一種不顧－切公法之恐怖運動為愈耶、</p>
<h3>江西路口發現腐屍</h3>
<p>驗明係日軍　用步槍所殺</p>

<h3>國聯大會席上李維諾夫演詞全文</h3>
<p>侵略更蠻橫地呈露其醜惡的面目　國聯對於侵略事件應有斷然處置　唯有集體制止侵略方能保障和平</p>
<p>［莫斯科］李維諾夫氏本月二十一日在國聯大會演說、辭云、“一年前吾人在此地提過的罪惡至今仍在繼續毒害國際空氣腐蝕國聯、侵略在理論及實踐上不但未曾絕跡、反而更加抬頭、更繼續地呈露其醜惡面目、更表現新的形式、更激烈的形式。此種侵略的表現、除西南歐原有頭帶假面具形式外、在亞洲已新增一更坦白的形式、國聯兩會員國方遭受外國陸海空軍的侵略、第三國之商船及戰艦均成為一切可能的攻擊之目標、主要的海上航綫已受海空兩路的海盜之危害、國際貿易方橫被糟塌、貴重的貨物擅遭沒收及轟沉、船員大批被捕被殺、海上盜匪橫行、無法無天、國際公法的基本原則全被踐踏無餘。</p>
<p>“在亞洲大陸上一國旣未宣戰、又毫無原因及理由、方進攻隣邦中國、派遣十萬大軍登陸封鎖海岸、使世界最大商業中心之一完全麻痺、而此種活動雖然尚係初步、將來究竟如何無人能預料。在歐洲方面另一國西班牙則已入外國軍隊進攻之第二年、其美麗的首都馬德里及其他城市每日遭受最殘酷的轟炸、人命損失無止數萬、物質及文化燬減無餘。”</p>
<p>國聯今已被請保證會員國之主權完整、保障和平及國際秩序、保證國際條約的神聖性尊重國際公法、而今乃漠然無覩．毫無動作。不但如此、現在且流行種見解、以為主要應不惜一切代價保謢國聯本身、使不被此種重大事件波及、使其孤立於該事件之外、有如弱女子。出於此種寶愛國際的溫柔態度出發、乃發生一種錯誤的見解、以為國聯無力抵抗侵路、武斷行為、非法活動及國際的盜匪業、因進行此種活動的國家不在聯盟之內、此種見解假定抵抗侵略、必需與侵略者本人合作方能成功、此種合作曾經實地試騐、西班牙問題曾經出國聯提出、交與特別組織的所謂不干涉倫敦委員會、以便邀得不能忍受日內瓦精神的主要匪首合作。此實騐的結果已非常明白、人人皆知、倫敦委員會乃一無所成、軍火輸入西班牙雖經正式禁止、然而輸與叛黨以供陸海空三面作戰者、則並未停頓、且由國家出面進行。外國人士雖經規定不准往西班牙參戰、然曾受軍事訓練的人士數萬名、整師的正規軍隊、擁有全付武裝及軍官統帥、仍被派往應援叛軍、除此以外、尚有外國軍艦游弋西海岸、援助叛軍巡邏、轟炸西國海港、言及此、孰能提及不干涉西班牙一事而不加譏笑乎？</p>
<p>“所謂從日內瓦精神解放，適應普及主義之需要的組織，其活動結果乃如上述。別方面，吾人則有孟德婁及最近尼翁會議之經騐，此兩會議雖不合普及主義，即並無此聞所信應加邀請方與該主義符合之各國，而乃能迅速完成其工作，如此結論已非常明顯，即問題並不在所謂普及主義，而在參加任何國際組織或會議的各國，雖各自民族利益頗有不同，而終應在一種共同普及的槪念下互相團結，此槪念即和平槪念，尊重他人獨立的槪念，廢除以武力為國策之工具的槪念，作為國聯盟約及非戰公約基礎之槪念。吾人均知現有三國已否定此槪念，而近年來彼三國已進攻他邦矣。</p>
<p>此三侵略國之政體，意議形態及物質文化水準雖各有不同，而均舉出同一動機為其侵略之理由—反共產主義。其統治者以為彼等僅須高喊“反共產國際”一咒語，其一切國際的罪惡均立應邀赦，彼等大言已國之共產主義業已根絕，毫無危險，乃將其滿腔愛情向他國不問遠近地輸出，聲稱其任務乃為援助他國掃除共產主義，不惜用其全部陸海空威力以達此目的。彼等不但不惜用其武力及財力，並準備使本國人民忍飢受凍冀可得充分軍火以助他國根絕共產主義，此為何，實不過公開地武力干涉他國內政，完全蔑視他國獨立而已</p>
<p>余今請問諸君，苟他國亦抱此種理論，而互相進兵，以己國政體橫加於對方者，世界局勢其將如何。然而，創造此種理論的各國，有時固會給吾人以比較反共產主義口號更切實的解釋。吾人如此方知，所謂反共產主義者實亦有一地質學上的意義，即對於錫，鋅，水銀，銅及其地鑛產之企求，然此乃任何百科全書所不載者也。</p>
<p>及至此一解釋亦尚不充分之時，反共產主義乃更被說明為要求有利的貿易之慾念，尤有進者，此反共產主義口號之範圍乃日在不斷擴大之中。有人提及布爾雪維克政權應加掃除之時，常在該政權之下附加“相類政權”等字樣。吾人更時聞一切民主的，議會制度的國家均已瀕於布兩雪維克化之說。如此，再進一步對是類國家亦大施貢獻，拯彼等免陷毀滅之域，冀與西班牙相同，固亦不遠矣。夫中國即為實例。就議會制度切實的意義言之，中國實難稱為議會制度國家。然而今日之對中國侵略者，乃亦用反共產主義之口號。同時在歐洲，吾人亦見擧凡經一般公認當為—下届侵略目標之各國，每預先被封為業已布爾雪維克化，或已在布爾雪維克影響之下。任何國家可為侵略國之目標者，均可被稱為有布爾雪維克嫌疑，因事實上無須證據，只要每日在報紙上及公開演說中一致宣傳，其根據固以為欺騙只須再三複述，即可變為眞實也。</p>
<p>余以為掃除此種危險的煽惑及侵略工具，此其時矣，一切眞心擁護和平的國家，均應對彼高坐堂皇執掌國政的鸚鵡輩聲明，無論每日複述若干次，胡說終為胡說，無論其外表飾有何種口號，侵略終為侵略，無論反共產主義有伺意義，或鑛物學的·或商業的·戰略的或一切一切的，在其掩飾下的侵略·武力干涉·割據鄰邦·違犯國際條約等任何行動，終不能邀得國際承認，同時吾人亦應向彼等聲明，彼輩宣傳瘋狂的嫉恨人類主義之徒，絕不能以擁護人類利益者目命，彼輩復活中世紀最野蠻的異端理論之徒，絕不能代表現代歐洲發言，彼輩焚燬人類心靈最優美的成果，虐待科學界，文藝界最高尚的代表，為全世界所鄙棄的狂徒，乃反高談拯救文明，從而借口組織十字軍進攻他人，實不自覺其醜態可掬，吾人苟能如此宣言，對於和平當為極大的貢獻也。</p>
<p>“數日前，在一次宣傳侵略西班牙合法的運動中，曾提出一份新的荒謬誣蔑，稱蘇聯方企圖克服西班牙，至少取得對於西國的政治影響，從而攪亂地中海之均勢，關於此，西總理奈格林日前業已聲明在西班牙衝突整個過程中，蘇聯從未向西國要求何物，過去及現在均無對於任何事物之企圖，蘇聯對於西班牙旣無鑛物學的，經濟的或戰略的用意，即所謂均勢者，亦全未加以考慮。蘇聯所關心者，乃為主張任何國家應自有全權决定自己的政體，不能由外國干涉，尤不能任外國軍隊干涉，蘇聯亦不能聽任他人在西班牙建立新根據地以便侵略全歐洲，蘇聯自始迄今，本未承認西班牙內戰雙方享有同等權利，然蘇聯仍參加一切不干涉的恊定，以及禁止非西籍人民參加軍事行動之議案，不過蘇聯於締結任一國際恊定時，當然有權自行留意俾不受欺騙，致該恊定對於某方則必須遵守，而他方則事實上並不履行，目前絕無高談對於和平之威脅的必要，因和平早已被破壞，不宣的戰爭早在兩大洲上進行，其影響實無人能加頂抖。”</p>
<p>李氏繼論及國聯的任務，當對所謂“挽敎國聯惟有普及主義”的見解斷加批判，稱渠“斷然反對用對於侵略者再作讓步，及拒絕保障會員國之代價以追求普及主義，去年國聯大會中吾人已討論過此問題，當時余即指出不在吾人掌中者實即在原則上反對普及主義之份子，問題乃在此，普及主義者究竟是否能行，需要何種代價，以及在目前條件下究能產生何種積極效果，國聯如無此普及主義，是否眞屬亳無辦法</p>
<p>“强大之國家如美國迄今，並未加入國聯，此吾人隨時不能忘記並眞感遺憾之事，吾人深知美國人民至愛和平，痛惡戰爭，吾人深知美總統及國務卿均忠實於國聯的理想，吾人深知苟美國能加入，國聯力量將增加幾許，然而余認定苟因此即以為美國本已準備加入，僅不願自行啟齒而乃在等候此方詢問或邀請，則未免對於美國實屬不敬，自知其威力的重要國家决不專一着重於此種微細的面子問題，余深信美政府苟發現在任何條件下可以加入國聯，卽决不致等待吾人之詢問或邀請，而有法使吾人知其意向。</p>
<p>“余有此種感覺，以為彼高談普及主義之人物，其意實在彼原在國聯之內，今已憤然退出，而其政策業經余對諸君述明之諸國家，余等今乃被勸告，謂應向彼公開宣傳及實行侵略，公開武力干涉他國內政，公開違犯國際條約之國家詢問，國聯究竟如伺方能抵抗侵略，保障全體會員國之獨立，豈彼輩之全部政策尚不足為今次建議的詢問之明自的答復乎</p>
<p>“本届大會必須解决重大緊急的問題，吾人已被請求援助兩個被侵略的會員國，此請求已置國聯於重大測騐之前，國聯苟永不担當其義務，”貫表示亳無辦法，則决不能維持任何權威，亦不能維持其存在，余敢確信國聯即在目前狀况下，亦能給與西班牙及中國以比較彼等所請求者更大的援助，從而不但不致增加，反將减少新的國際糾紛，國聯在侵略之前究能及究應如何措置乎，吾人曾聞某英國作家有一格言，謂免除誘惑的最良方法，是屈服於誘惑，余知現頗有不少此類的政治的聖人，亦以為免除侵略的最良方法，係對侵略屈服，彼等斥責西班牙人民，謂不應對叛軍將領及其後盾諸國作英勇的抵抗、彼等相信中國最聰明的辦法，係不戰而接受侵略者的最後通牒式的要求，自動地變為該國的附庸，但國聯並非為貢獻此種勸告而設，而國聯苟卽不貢獻此種勸告，但乃永遠消極，自怨自艾，嘆自己孱弱，自己的普及主義不完備，以及實行侵略不遵自己的決議之各國不能參加自己的會議，茍如此，則國聯實亦無存在的理由。</p>
<p>“此種路綫早經試用，結果已引出此壇上一切演說家所引為遺憾的局勢，此路綫已使某某數會員國喪失極大的領土，數千萬的人民，使其他國家完全喪失其國家地位，因國聯在滿洲衝突中消極之故，數年後卽發生進攻阿比西尼亞之事，因國聯在阿比西尼亞事件中活動不夠，乃促起西班牙方面的試騐，因國聯完全不能援助西班牙，今又鼓動對中國的新進攻，如此，在五年中吾人乃得到四次侵略，吾人共見侵略因未被制止，乃從一大洲傳至另一大洲，每次範圍亦愈廣大，此鐵的事實，現在任何不能否認者也。</p>
<p>“別方面，余堅決相信苟國聯對於一項侵略事件採斷然的政策，其他事件必將完全絕跡，唯有如此，一切國家方能覺悟侵略並無利益，侵略亦不應採取，唯有如此，從前的會員國方能自敲吾人之門，而吾人將欣然迎其加入，吾人將不問共世界觀，不問其國內政體，因國聯承認一切現有政體的和平共存，從而吾人之普及的國聯之共同理想將能實現，永為和平的工具，但吾人决不能由發出質疑表而完成此種理想，吾人唯有集體制止侵略，集體保障和平，方能使其實現，而和平固吾人全體所必需，其利益亦吾人全體所共享者也、</p>
<p>李氏演說舉，全場掌聲雷動，代表多人立即趨與道賀，外廊中代表及新聞記者等均趨於蘇聯代表團及新聞記者團之前，稱此次演說為國聯成立多年來彼等所聞最有力的一次，甚至素對蘇聯代表團並無好感之各界，亦承認此次演說映象極深。（二十三日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>抗戰時期的經濟建設</h3>
<p>— 周憲文</p>
<p>語云。“兵兇戰危”。戰爭之與破壞。如影隨形。在這抗戰時期來談經濟建設·似乎不懂事理但是我們必得牢牢緊記這一次的抗戰是長期的抗戰我們勢不能祇有長期的破壤而不講什麼建設其實我們必須同時努力建設始能長期支持抗戰。始能抗戰擭得勝利。然則在這抗戰時期。經濟究應如何建設。這當然不是本文所能盡述現在祗好提出幾個比較重要的問題。</p>
<p>在平時。人們儘管主張自由。到現在我們必得實施統制。當前的急務。是政府要有一專門的機關。負起計劃並統制抗戰時期經濟建設的責任。依據正確的計劃。實施嚴格的統制。再不能‘雜亂無章。’‘各自為政。’至於計劃的綱領與統制的目標亦可約略言之。</p>
<p>第一。敵人已經封鎖我們的沿海。北自秦皇島南迄北海。在這局面之下。我們的對外貿易。自然要受絕大的影響。海關稅收的减少。猶其餘事。當此時期。凡是一向推銷外國的特產我們還得利用可以利用的海陸交通路綫設法繼續出口。這不單關係我國產業的隆替。且可籍以增加國際收入。穩固國際信用。使我們能在戰時向海外多買一些軍事上必需的械彈與生活上必需的商品至於進口貿易。我們也得有一計劃。何種商品可以根本不用（例如妝飾品之額。）絕對不許進口。何種商品可以他物代用。相對不許進口。何種商品可以自行生產。乘機發展本國的產業如有非向外國購買不可的商品則宜向何國購買宜用何種方法購買都須有計劃有統計。</p>
<p>第二。過去我國的都市鄉村是在畸形的發展。我這基礎十分脆弱的民族工業。大多集中在沿海的通商大埠。現在這些地方都已成了戰區。或將成為戰區。我們的工廠。卽不燬於敵軍。也是無法開工。這對我民族工業的打擊。當然是十分的嚴重。但是我們不要太悲觀。祗要有計劃。奮鬥。前途充滿了光明。因為我們的工業。一向是受各先進資本主義國家的商品所壓迫。尤其是受敵人無恥的走私貨物所摧殘。而莫由發展。現在戰局旣開。敵貨自絕。敵人在我沿海通都的工廠。同受浩刧。而各先進資本主義國家的商品。也受戰時交通等等的影響。不易輸入。我們正可利用這一時機。為我民族工業奠下穩固的基礎。凡我戰區無法開工的廠家固然需耍向內地遷移卽在臨近戰區的工廠亦得豫為之計。至於何種工廠應該先移。何種工廠可以稍緩。何種工廠應設於何處。何種工廠又應設於何處。都有待於正確的計劃與嚴密的統制。除了遷移舊廠之外。又當增設何種新廠。設於何處。同樣需要有計劃有統制。而一切由遷移舊廠或添設新廠所引起的困難。尤須以最大的努力。求有效的解决又與向內地發展民族工業具有連帶關係的問題。是如何使集中在沿海都市的資本以及熟練工人都能復歸於內地。抗戰發生以後。把資本向外國輸送。固然是一件不好的現象。把熟練工人當作一般難民遣送回籍。也未見得是一個妥當的辦法。</p>
<p>第三。也正因為過去我國都市與鄉村的畸形發展。致使數十年來以農立國的中國。一面反須每年由外國輸入巨額的農產品。同時荒地則有增無巳。現在在這抗戰時期外國農產品的輸入。自然不若過去來得容易。這固然是復興我農業經濟的一個機會。但是我們也得有計劃。有統制。那些農產品急須生產那些地方適於種稙那種農產品。農民拚命種殖的結果是否仍舊除了納租繳稅以外一無所有。甚或不足農產品的供給與需要能否聯緊。據聞現在浦東附近一帶就有大量的棉花苦於無處運銷。這些困難應當如何克服凡此種種。都是抗戰時期農業經濟建設上的大問題。</p>
<p>以上所說。抗戰時期的經濟建設僅僅講到農工商業。要使這些建設能夠收效。當然還得講到抗戰時期的交通金融以及財政諸問題。但因限於篇幅。容當另文求正。最後記者尚欲附帶一言。卽自抗戰開始以來。大多數的智識份子。都感覺到無事可做。苦悶焦急。一部份的智識份子。則似乎忙得不可開交。疊床架屋的組織了許多團體。一日數會。有會必到。到必發言。他們如果想到了這樣忙的效果如何。恐也不免於苦悶焦急。但是我們必須記得這次抗戰是長期抗戰一定要長期方有勝利的把握。我們應當分工合作。少說空話。多做實事。別人已做而且能做的事。就讓別人去做。我們應當本‘實事求是’‘埋頭苦幹’的精神。一面聽候政府的調遣。同時多做一點自己本份以內的工作。作比如上文所說抗戰時期的各種經濟建設問題。就够好些經濟學徒的研究。我們還會說沒有事情可做麼。</p>

<p>東京通信：一時視為頗嚴重之所謂銀座事件，著有若干軍人，每日在東京最熱鬧之銀座市上菜館酒肆中，大發議論，痛罵軍部，且將軍部黑幕，當眾宣傳此事為築地警署所聞，卽派人調查，方知其為首者，名中村五郎，住蒲田區志茂田町，乃派人搜查其家中·不意中村突然取出軍刀，將巡警亂斫，於是釀成極大問題。現中村雖已拘去，正在搜查其羽黨，且自軍部觀察，以為必有扣當背景，故對中村，將加嚴密之審問。</p>
<p>日本兵士，不但親友贈以「千人縫」及神社所發之靈符，以避槍彈，晨近更有仁丹公司，對購買仁丹之顧客，各贈靈符道（如圖），可謂善於投機矣。據其廣告中云：自八月四日至九月九日止，此靈符共贈去六十一萬一千五百四十道，日本人之迷信，日本兵士之胆怯，於此可見。且云：此符，不特可以避彈，月可以視武運之長久，屡次在戰场上，已頗奏效。其思穗之幼稚，寶足令人噴飯。</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>日本在其速戰速决的政策失敗後。日暮途窮。便以大量飛機。轟炸南京廣州。及其他繁盛城市。交通要區。慘殺一般無辜民眾。此其舉動之殘酷。與其國策之失敗。已有明證。</p>
<p>但是人類的正義與道德。尚未沒於人間。致起全人類公憤。故此次日機慘殺我無辜民眾。各外報或稱之為森林中之惡魔。或稱之為人類之仇敵。或稱之為日本政策中必有瘋狂性存在。或稱之為世界文明國間之地位。留一永不磨滅之污點。此種暴行。在第三國人見之。已深惡痛絕若此。我輩身受暴日之惠賜者。尚有何種更深期的名詞。足以表彰暴日之罪狀。與我輩心靈中之憤恨情緒。惟有以「刻骨銘心」四字。永牢記著此種暴行。以待後日之報復而已。</p>
<p>但是各國雖表同情於我國。多取觀望熊度。而不敢予以最有效力之援助者。對於彼此之間。究尚有一種隔閡也。要之此日暴日所加於我國者。安之他日不轉而及其身。故欲免除己國未來之禍害。與維持世界永久之和平。非先維持世界之公理與人道不可。</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Military News: Sources have received a telegraphic report of victory from our Northern Theater, stating that after the enemy luckily achieved some victories on the Ping-Sui line, they divided their forces to invade northern Shanxi and the mountainous areas of eastern Shanxi. On the night of the 23rd, when the enemy forces reached the lines of Hunyuan County, Diaojuan Village, and Nandonggou of Baikang Village, our main force switched to an offensive posture, surrounded the enemy, and launched a surprise attack, causing them to collapse in disarray. In this battle, over 3,000 enemies were killed and over 2,000 were captured, along with countless artillery pieces and machine guns. Our army is currently in pursuit.

After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy could not withstand the attack and retreated north towards the Dajiangou. Due to heavy rain, they could not be pursued far. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. Furthermore, a certain brigade of our army at Honggetu fought fiercely with the enemy on the evening of the 18th. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>[Hankou] Hankou was attacked by enemy aircraft today at 4:50 PM. Six Japanese bombers and three fighters appeared in the skies over here, dropping nine bombs. Three of these bombs landed in densely populated areas of the city, four landed on the opposite bank of the Han River, and two landed in the river, less than 200 yards from the British gunboat HMS Aphis. It is currently estimated that at least 100 people were killed and 100 injured, all of whom were impoverished civilians. No foreigners were injured. Eighty houses were destroyed in Hankou, and the overall losses are not yet known. The Japanese aircraft clearly aimed at the Hanyang Arsenal, but according to reliable sources, no military installations were hit. The police chief is directing rescue efforts and comforting residents, which is commendable. Wuhan University students are also working hard to assist the authorities in rescuing the wounded civilians. The scene in the disaster area is extremely tragic. Wives are crying for their husbands, children are crying for their parents, and the groans of the wounded create a scene of unbearable sorrow. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to a telephone call from Hankou, 13 Japanese aircraft came from the south and eight came from the north, attacking Hankou, Hanyang, and Wuchang at 4:30 PM, causing at least 800 casualties. (Central News Agency/Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>

Our ground and naval forces used various anti-aircraft guns to fire at the enemy aircraft. Our air force also fought bravely to intercept them in the air. Seeing that we were prepared, the enemy hurriedly dropped more than ten bombs along the Xiang River in Hankou and Hanyang, collapsing more than ten houses of the poor and injuring dozens of civilians. They then fled eastward along their original route at 5 PM, without any other damage. It is reported that one enemy aircraft was shot down by us near Gedian. Investigators are currently being dispatched. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] At 4:50 PM on the 24th, 13 enemy aircraft attacked Hankou via Xunyang and engaged our air force in fierce combat. Gunfire was very dense.

<p>[Guangzhou] Since the night of the 21st, Guangzhou has been attacked more than ten times, with each raid lasting from two to five hours, especially at night. A total of over a hundred bombs have been dropped, causing hundreds of casualties among innocent civilians. Because reports are received day and night, accurate figures are impossible to obtain. Many of the seriously injured cannot be saved, and the bodies of the dead are incomplete, while the living are covered in injuries, a scene of utter devastation. Even the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, which has nothing to do with military affairs, has been bombed twice, with five bombs dropped, creating huge holes in all four steps. One bomb also landed on the roof, destroying dozens of chairs in the main hall. Their intentions are unfathomable. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] According to sources in the transportation sector, several enemy aircraft bombed Qiongya at 1:45 PM on the 24th. They are currently engaged in fierce combat with our air force. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Nanchang] At 3 PM on the 24th, 13 enemy aircraft were spotted on the border between Jiangxi and Fujian, flying from southeast to northwest. After receiving the report, our air defense command immediately issued an alert. At around 3 PM, the enemy aircraft passed through various counties in eastern Jiangxi.

After our anti-aircraft gun units fired fiercely, one enemy aircraft was damaged. Seeing the situation was not good, the remaining aircraft flew high above 5,000 meters and dropped multiple bombs in the northeast corner and suburbs of the city, killing and injuring over a dozen civilians and destroying several houses. They then flew towards the southeast, and the remaining aircraft also left for the Jiangxi-Fujian border at the same time. The alert was lifted at 7 PM. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The Chinese army shot down two Japanese aircraft with anti-aircraft guns north of Baoding. This is the first time the North China Army has used anti-aircraft guns. Japanese naval aircraft bombed Jining and Yanzhou on the 20th. (Central News Agency/Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Qingjiangpu] According to relevant sources, at around 2 PM on the 21st, an enemy warship approached the outer harbor of Lianyungang and shelled the pier area with heavy artillery, firing over a dozen rounds. We returned fire, forcing it to retreat. Subsequently, nine enemy aircraft flew from the direction of Dongliandao and dropped over a dozen bombs on the railway station building and warehouses of the Longhai Railway. Our army fired fiercely with anti-aircraft guns, and one of the aircraft was hit and injured. It fled hastily with the other aircraft. Furthermore, at around 4 PM, one enemy aircraft flew over Lianyungang from the northwest, with smoke coming from its damaged tail, and crashed into the northeast sea. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Hankou] The area with the most casualties in today's enemy aircraft attack was Wujingmiao (transliteration), a slum area in Hankou. There are no military installations near that area. It is feared that the four bombs that landed in Hanyang also caused many casualties. It is reported that two bombs also landed in the courtyard of the Catholic Middle School in Wuchang, but only one Chinese student who was leaning against the window watching the aircraft attack was killed. Flames erupted where the bombs landed and continued to burn fiercely until late at night. Police and members of the merchant corps rescued the wounded and moved the dead until nightfall. As for the exact number of casualties, it is impossible to determine for the time being. It is feared that the number known tomorrow may not be less than those in Nanjing and Guangzhou. Currently, it is known that over 200 people have been killed and about 500 injured. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Discusses China's Unlimited Capacity for Resistance with Foreign Reporters</h3>
<p>The Duration of the War Depends on the Attitudes of Japan and the Great Powers, All Countries Should Abide by Their Obligations, and All Treaties That Allow Japan's Actions Have Been Torn Up</p>
<p>[Nanjing] In recent days, foreign reporters have been flocking to Nanjing from Shanghai, especially American reporters. On the morning of the 24th, they went to pay their respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and asked various questions. Chairman Chiang answered them one by one, and they all expressed great satisfaction. Furthermore, Ju Dijun, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, hosted a banquet at the International Club on the evening of the 24th to entertain the foreign reporters. Maurice, Far East Manager of the Associated Press, Nick Bock, a famous reporter from the World News Agency, and 14 other people attended. The guests and hosts parted happily at around 10 PM. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, met with foreign journalists today. Regarding the Japanese bombing of Nanjing, he stated that the bombing of the Chinese capital would not affect China's military situation but would make the Chinese people and the people of the world more fully understand Japan's barbarity. "China's resistance will not stop as long as Japan's aggression continues." Chairman Chiang further stated that he felt that the current attitude of the United States was not its true attitude and that he deeply believed that the American government and people had always respected justice, law, and order and that the friendship between China and the United States had a long history. Therefore, in this struggle of China's resistance to Japanese aggression, they would be able to sympathize with and aid China. Today, Chairman Chiang met with foreign journalists in a large hall. The Chairman was in high spirits, smiling, and wearing a yellow Zhongshan suit. He sat behind a large desk in a corner of the room. The foreign journalists sat around him in a semi-circle. The Chairman's wife wore a black long robe and sat to the right of the Chairman as his translator. After the discussion, Chairman Chiang and his wife agreed to the reporters' request to take photos. The Chairman and his wife greatly appreciated the reporters' risking the danger of Japanese bombing to come to Nanjing to report the news and expressed great gratitude for the accurate and sympathetic reports in the world's newspapers about China's resistance during this war. Regarding the attitude of the United States, Chairman Chiang stated that China's resistance this time was not only for the survival of China itself but also to uphold justice under the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations Covenant. Therefore, the signatory countries of the treaty and the covenant should provide assistance to China's struggle. "During the validity of the treaty and the covenant, the United States should not consider neutrality." Chairman Chiang continued, "The United States cannot remain neutral. I believe that the people and governments of the signatory countries have not forgotten their obligations." When asked about the unilateral ban on transporting arms to China and the relocation of the American ambassador to the gunboat USS Luzon on the 21st of this month, Chairman Chiang stated, "I feel that I do not need to comment because American friends and news reporters stationed in China have already witnessed everything here. What they feel must be the same as what I feel." The reporter then asked what the responsibilities of various countries were. Chairman Chiang stated, "All signatory countries should abide by their obligations. However, the United States is the convener of the Washington Conference, and the establishment of the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations Covenant were all due to the efforts of the United States. Therefore, its responsibility is even greater." Chairman Chiang then expressed surprise at the current attitude of various countries because they not only abandoned their obligations but also "placed themselves under the control of Japan, watching everything they had signed be torn up and destroyed." The reporter then asked if China still hoped for the assistance of the League of Nations. Chairman Chiang said, "Justice will prevail in the end." When asked about the duration of the Sino-Japanese War, Chairman Chiang stated that China's resistance to Japanese aggression has no time limit. As long as Japanese aggression continues, or before the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations Covenant are implemented, the war will not stop. China can no longer tolerate the Japanese military exerting pressure on China. Therefore, the duration of the war depends entirely on the attitudes of Japan and the Great Powers. "Any country that does not respect international humanitarian principles cannot last." Chairman Chiang also stated that the Japanese military attempted to destroy the defensive works in the Jiangyin area so that Japanese warships could sail up the Yangtze River and bombard Nanjing, so they sent aircraft to bomb. However, as a result, the defensive works in the Jiangyin area remained firmly in place. "No matter how long this war will last, China has the capacity for unlimited resistance because China is a country with inexhaustible power and inexhaustible financial resources. A Japanese blockade of the coast may deal a great blow to other countries, but it will have very little impact on China." (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Signatory Countries of the Nine-Power Treaty Are Exchanging Views</h3>
<p>British and American Contacts Are Particularly Close, It Is Difficult to Convene a Meeting at This Time</p>
<p>[Washington] Someone in Geneva suggested convening a meeting of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to discuss the Sino-Japanese conflict. The State Department stated today that the United States has been discussing this matter with several signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, but only to exchange information. Whenever an event occurs, the countries related to the Nine-Power Treaty engage in exchanging opinions, but they have not implemented the consultation procedures stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty. It is understood that the closest cooperation in exchanging views is with the United Kingdom. However, the State Department also has talks with China and Japan almost every day. Officials believe that formally invoking the Nine-Power Treaty may not be effective immediately because the treaty only stipulates that countries consult each other and does not stipulate the necessity of convening a meeting. Secretary of State Hull stated that the US government's view on the Nine-Power Treaty can be found in the State Department's declaration on August 23rd, and there is no change now. (National News Agency Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Officials stated today that the United States is very willing to cooperate with other countries concerned about the Far East situation to resolve the current crisis peacefully, but is also unwilling to make substantial expressions before the purpose and method of the suggestions made in Geneva are clarified. So far, other countries have not contacted the United States, so the United States is also unwilling to discuss hypothetical issues. Some people advocate convening an international conference, but it is not known whether it will be purely a meeting of the Nine-Power Treaty countries or will expand the scope to include Soviet Russia, Germany, Australia, and other countries. The United States should be particularly cautious before it is certain about the nature of the conference. Some people believe that whether Soviet Russia participates or not will be a very important issue because Soviet Russia has a major relationship with the Far East. However, inviting them to participate will inevitably arouse strong dissatisfaction from Japan. If Germany and Italy also participate at the same time, it may reduce this reaction, but it may also increase the complexity of the situation. The Nine-Power Treaty does not stipulate that a meeting must be convened, only that the signatory countries consult each other. The United States has already consulted with China, Japan, and the United Kingdom, and other countries may have also done so. It is said that even those countries that declared their compliance after the establishment of the Nine-Power Treaty can be consulted informally. When Secretary of State Hull recently announced the US Far East policy, he stated that the United States intends to avoid various alliances, but also firmly believes that international cooperation can be achieved to peacefully achieve the goals of the July 16 declaration. It can be seen from this that the United States is now prepared to work with other countries to mediate the crisis in the Far East by peaceful means. (National News Agency Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army's Aerial Atrocities Shame Modern Civilization</h3>
<p>European and American Newspapers Unanimously Condemn, Demanding Joint Effort to Stop the Atrocities</p>
<p>[London] London evening newspapers published reports from eyewitnesses of the Japanese aircraft bombing of Guangzhou today, with headlines such as "The Most Horrific Sky Attack Ever," "Civilians Flee in Terror," "Corpses Litter the Ground," "Thousands Die in the Cruelest Sky Attack," "Japanese Aircraft Strafe Civilians," "Guangzhou Air Raid a Disaster," and "Japan Destroys Guangzhou." Incoming telegrams all stated that the unusually high number of deaths and injuries among non-combat personnel were private estimates, which could not be immediately confirmed, and that the Japanese aircraft did not hit any military targets. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] British public opinion is unanimously indignant about the Japanese aircraft bombing of Nanjing and Guangzhou, even among those usually pro-Japanese. An evening newspaper, known for its pro-Japanese stance, stated, "If Japan wishes to preserve its honor and achieve its military objectives, there must be other ways than resorting to the indiscriminate use of bombs to impress Western countries. It would be wise for the Japanese government to consider this." The Liberal Party's *Star* newspaper was even more severe, stating, "The sneer we are accustomed to seeing on the faces of the Japanese is merely the mask of death. The behavior of Japanese aircraft bombing Nanjing and Guangzhou is the height of barbarism. The countries of the world must now unanimously condemn it. Whether we can stop this atrocity, we set aside for the moment, but for the sake of human justice, we must condemn Japan, hoping that future generations will denounce it as a shameful act of murder." (Central News Agency, 20th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] The outrage of British newspapers over the Japanese aircraft bombing of Chinese cities is increasing daily. The *Daily Telegraph* recently commented, "If the governments of Europe and America do not lodge strong protests and stop it, Nanjing and Guangzhou will surely become unprecedented killing fields. The Japanese army's attack on cities with heavy bombers is not aerial warfare, but aerial massacre. This is contrary to the spirit and letter of the laws of war. For the sake of civilization and humanity, the countries of Europe and America should take timely and effective collective action to intervene." The *Liberal Party News Chronicle*'s commentary, bordered in black, was exceptionally striking, stating, "The people of Britain are crying out loudly and resolutely to take action to stop this cruel act. Millions of people around the world are now watching and waiting. If we can raise our voices, they will surely respond. In short, for the sake of civilization and humanity, we should do so. Even for our own sake, we cannot allow Japan to create a bad precedent, lest we suffer its bad effects in the future." (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] Anxiety here about the developments in the Far East is increasing. This morning's newspapers unanimously condemned the Japanese air force's indiscriminate bombing of Guangzhou and Nanjing, deeply regretting the complete failure of diplomatic intervention by various countries. According to the *Daily Mail*, two-thirds of Japan's imports come from Britain and the United States, thus implying that Britain and the United States may take economic sanctions against it. The newspaper continued, "Japan's aircraft fuel is entirely supplied by Britain, the United States, and Russia. It is truly regrettable that it is being used for such atrocities." (24th, National Maritime Telegraph)</p>
<p>[New York] The *New York Evening Post* today commented on the Japanese aircraft bombing of Nanjing and Guangzhou, stating, "This behavior will leave an indelible stain on Japan's position among the civilized nations of the world." The newspaper also stated, "The formal protest lodged by the United States with Japan will only deepen Japan's resentment of the United States." *The New York Times* believes that there must be madness in Japanese policy, because it not only cannot stop China's anti-Japanese movement, but has also created righteous resentment. No matter what the result of the conquest may be, this resentment will be difficult to diminish. The newspaper also stated, "Every bomb dropped by the Japanese army in Nanjing and Guangzhou will diminish whatever friendship and respect Western countries still hold for the rulers of Japan." (Central News Agency, 24th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Paris] *Le Temps* recently published an editorial expressing outrage at the Japanese aircraft bombing of Nanjing and Guangzhou, stating, "The most terrible weapon of destruction ever invented by mankind is now being used in the Far East. The Japanese aircraft bombing of Nanjing and Guangzhou not only violates international law, but also violates the promises explicitly offered by the Japanese government. Moreover, China and Japan have not formally declared war, and the Chinese government has no intention of severing diplomatic relations with Japan, yet Japanese aircraft continue to bomb indiscriminately. This is truly perplexing to international opinion." (Central News Agency, 23rd, Havas)</p>

<h3>Enemy Eagle Mori Brigade Commander Killed in Liuhang Battle</h3>
<p>Tokyo Radio Broadcast Confirms, Enemy Brigade Commander and Captains Killed by Our Forces</p>
<p>On the 20th, enemy forces in the Yanghang area attacked our positions in Liuhang. Our battalion commander, Yin Zhen, was wounded by a bullet at the time, but refused to retreat, continuing to direct his troops in battle. On the afternoon of the 21st, the enemy deployed its main force, and the fighting became even more intense. Our troops resolutely defended their positions, standing firm. Reinforcements then arrived, launching a fierce counterattack against the enemy, routing their main force. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than 2,000 casualties. At 6:00 PM on the 23rd, we received a Tokyo radio broadcast report, learning that the enemy brigade commander, Eagle Mori, was shot and killed by our forces in this battle. The Morita unit commander, who was acting as Eagle Mori's replacement in directing the battle at the time, also died in succession. This shows the fierceness of the battle and the bravery of our troops. It is reported that Eagle Mori was known for his bravery among the enemy forces, and was one of the brigade commanders who first landed at Xiaochuan sandbar and invaded Luodian. Of these, brigade commander Nakakura had already been killed by our forces in the battle for Luodian on the 29th of last month. Now, of the three brigade commanders, only Takeda remains. According to the same report, among the enemy forces attacking our Shenjiazhai position, unit commander Bokube, artillery Major Takeuchi, and Captain Matsumoto were seriously wounded. Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th. According to reliable sources, on the night of the 23rd, the enemy's newly added troops on the Luodian-Liuhang line launched five fierce attacks on our forces. Our rear reinforcements then launched a counterattack to the north of Luodian, encircling the enemy's rear. More than 2,000 enemy troops were routed, and more than 1,000 who could not retreat were trapped in a heavy encirclement, fighting desperately, and were annihilated. Numbering found among the enemy corpses revealed that they were new reinforcements from the first and second Taiwan garrison units.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th, Reuters. The General Headquarters announced today that after three days of continuous fighting on the Luodian-Liuhang line, the Chinese army had repelled the Japanese army's offensive in that area, with the Japanese suffering thousands of casualties.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th. According to a Tokyo radio broadcast on the 23rd, on the 21st and 22nd of this month, the Japanese army's Morita unit and Okumura unit were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army when they attacked Liuhe and Yanghang. The commanders of these two units and Lieutenant Colonel Takeda were all killed by bullets. The enemy's so-called "unit" is actually a company or battalion, and a lieutenant colonel is a middle-ranking officer, which shows the severity of their losses.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces Heavily Defeated in Rash Advances in Yanghang and Yuepu</h3>
<p>Japanese Casualties Number in the Thousands</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th. Military sources stated that at around 8:00 PM on the 23rd, a telephone call was received from Shanghai stating that the enemy had repeatedly attacked us without success. On the 23rd, they again attacked us from the Yanghang-Yuepu area with a combined infantry and artillery unit, very fiercely. Our troops calmly responded, and although the enemy charged five times, they did not succeed. We then used a portion of our forces to launch a fierce attack from the north side of Luodian, from the enemy's flanks, encircling the enemy who could not retreat. It is estimated that more than 2,000 Japanese and Taiwanese soldiers were routed, and Japanese casualties also numbered in the thousands. The battlefield is currently being cleared. Our army's great victory was the result of the enemy's rash advance.</p>
<h3>Enemy Takahashi Detachment Almost Completely Annihilated by Our Forces</h3>
<p>Only One of Six Battalions Remains; Our Front Line is Solid and Safe</p>
<p>The enemy's Takahashi Detachment was formed in Taiwan on the 14th of this month, departed on the 16th, and landed at Wusong on the 18th, immediately transported by motor vehicle to the north of Luodian. This detachment was formed from two regiments, the first regiment commander being Samura, and the second regiment commander being Shigezumi. Each regiment consisted of three battalions. From the evening of the 19th to the evening of the 21st, they launched a fierce attack on our right flank. Initially, this detachment used a battalion to guard Liuhe Town, and used about a regiment's worth of troops to attack the Suncun area. They were bravely repelled by our troops. The enemy then continued to attack with another regiment, but still did not succeed. Finally, the enemy launched a fierce attack on us with the main force of the detachment. By the evening of the 21st, the enemy had been killed by us in Yaozhai alone, numbering more than 400, and we had seized two heavy machine guns, more than ten light machine guns, more than 100 rifles, and countless other spoils of war. Apart from the battalion guarding Liuhe, the other five battalions of the detachment have been almost completely annihilated by us. As for the fierce fighting between the enemy and us in the Luodian area on the 22nd and 23rd, although our army suffered some losses, the front line is solid and safe.</p>
<h3>Enemy Repeatedly Attacked Liuhang, All Repelled</h3>
<p>The fighting near Liuhang was even fiercer yesterday. The enemy used its full force to launch more than ten attacks on our army's positions in that area. Our troops fought back fiercely in hand-to-hand combat, fighting until the afternoon, when the enemy, due to excessive casualties, finally collapsed and retreated. However, the enemy's ambition has not waned, and they are still trying to gather their remnants to attack the unit of our □ division, which offered the fiercest resistance on that line. However, our position is solid and our morale is high. If the enemy attacks again, we will resolutely deal a heavy blow. Central News Agency reported that since the early morning, the enemy army has launched a fierce frontal attack on our side in the Liuhang area. In the evening, the enemy concentrated its artillery fire and fiercely bombarded our line of Yangmuqiao, Mengwan, Chaowangmiao, and Tiaobanqiao. Under the cover of artillery fire, enemy infantry □ repeatedly charged at us. Our army bravely met the attack, and the enemy ultimately failed to succeed. As of 2:00 AM yesterday morning (24th), the fighting was still fierce.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Attack on Pudong Yesterday Still Ineffective</h3>
<p>Artillery Fire Exchanged in the Qichangzhan Area; Enemy Aircraft Dropped Bombs, Killing a Civilian Woman</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the enemy forces again moved towards the Pudong area. At 2:00 PM, several enemy warships and five or six enemy aircraft launched a fierce joint attack on the Qichangzhan area. The sound of artillery and bombs continued non-stop. Our side also used fierce artillery fire to return the attack, and the two sides fought fiercely. After two hours, the enemy realized that it was difficult to advance and stopped firing. It was later found that in the Meiyuanzhai area at the southern end of Qichangzhan, enemy aircraft dropped more than ten bombs, four of which exploded, destroying two civilian houses. Only one civilian woman was hit by shrapnel in the abdomen, and her intestines flowed out, killing her. The enemy aircraft's shells fell in the distance. However, one shell hit near the Cao surname residence at Lujiazhaqiao and exploded, injuring a civilian woman named Cao Hongshi in the buttocks, and her son, Baolin, was injured in the head. Our army suffered absolutely no damage. At 3:00 AM this morning, an enemy boat, fully loaded with soldiers, again attempted to land on the wasteland to the right of the Taitong Wharf, first using machine guns to sweep the shore to scout out the situation. At the same time, an enemy warship in the middle of the river also assisted with heavy machine guns. As the enemy boat approached, our side fired a burst of machine gun fire, and the enemy soldiers fled in panic.</p>
<h3>Enemy Bombed Northeast of Luodian Yesterday</h3>
<p>Our Position Suffered No Damage</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that the enemy army bombarded our position northeast of Luodian at dawn yesterday, continuously for several hours. However, our position suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Enemy Reinforcements Arrived Again Yesterday, Numbering 7,000</h3>
<p>Since the enemy bandits invaded Shanghai, it has been more than forty days, but they are still confined to the eastern corner of Shanghai, with little progress. They have repeatedly suffered head-on blows from our army and suffered heavy losses. Their total casualties have reached about 20,000. Therefore, in order to actively replenish their forces so that they can launch another large-scale offensive, they have made a fourth request for reinforcements from the country. A portion of their reinforcements, about 8,000 men, has arrived in succession in the past three days. Yesterday morning, the enemy merchant ship, converted into the 38th transport ship *Kouan Maru*, docked at the Osaka Wharf. In the afternoon, the enemy merchant ship, converted into the 306th transport ship *Fuku Maru*, also docked at the Osaka Wharf. The *Mitsuaki Maru* docked at the Zhaoshangju North Wharf, the *Chikugo Maru* docked at the Huishan Wharf, and the *Seiko Maru* (No. 176) and *Ikuhisa Maru* (No. 103) docked at the Huangpu Wharf. A total of six ships brought another part of the enemy's reinforcements, about 7,000 men. They immediately disembarked separately. At the same time, a large number of military horses were transported. In total, the enemy reinforcements who have landed at various wharves in the eastern district of Shanghai in recent days have reached a total of about 15,000 men. The total number of reinforcements that the enemy is sending this time is one division and one brigade, totaling about 40,000 men. It is said that a portion of them has also landed at various locations along the river. It is also reported that the enemy Red Cross ship, *Burun Maru*, sailed to Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday and docked at Huishan Wharf. A large number of medical supplies were immediately unloaded, and at the same time, hundreds of wounded enemy soldiers were carried onto the ship to be transported back to Japan for treatment.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Transported Munitions and Cannons</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that in addition to the approximately 15,000 men of the fourth enemy reinforcement, who have already arrived in Shanghai, a large number of enemy munitions and military supplies have also been transported. Yesterday afternoon, two enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships, the *Fifth Unkai Maru* and *Buryo Maru*, arrived and docked at the 15th floating pier and Osaka Wharf, unloading a large number of large bombs for the enemy air force and many other military supplies.</p>
<p>It is also reported that after our army secured the first line of defense, the enemy naval artillery lost its effectiveness. In addition to transporting a large number of munitions from the country in recent days, the enemy army also dismantled the cannons on enemy warships, transported them ashore at the Yunzaobang and Qiujiang wharves, and transported them to the front line to set up artillery positions.</p>
<h3>Enemy Conscripts Soldiers from Korea and Taiwan</h3>
<p>In Order to Avoid Extreme Panic Among the Domestic Population, They Give Priority to Conscripting Soldiers from Korea and Taiwan</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the enemy's invasion of Shanghai has repeatedly suffered heavy blows, and they have repeatedly requested reinforcements, but have ultimately failed to succeed. Recently, they have been bombing our inland areas on a large scale on the one hand, and are planning to increase reinforcements on a large scale on the other, in an attempt to make a desperate gamble. However, in order to avoid causing extreme panic among the domestic population, the enemy army authorities will give priority to conscripting compulsory military service from Korea and Taiwan, numbering about two divisions, to be transported to Shanghai to serve as frontline assault troops. The enemy's exhaustion of resources and evil intentions can be deeply understood from the above news.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Enemy Warships in the Shanghai-Wusong Waters</h3>
<p>Total of 65 Yesterday</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that the number of enemy warships anchored in the Shanghai-Wusong waters has increased again in recent days. Apart from most of the transport ships sailing out after transporting enemy warmongers and munitions, the remaining enemy warships anchored in the Shanghai-Wusong waters still number 65. Their anchoring situation is as follows: (A) Wusong Area: two large battleships and two cruisers at the Yangtze River estuary, five transport ships, four destroyers, and three gunboats. At the Wusong estuary: one cruiser, one destroyer No. 16, two destroyers No. 9, and three transport ships. In the waters from Yunzaobang to Zhanghuabang: two destroyers No. 22 and two gunboats. At the Qiujiang Wharf: three destroyers No. 6, two destroyers No. 21, and one transport ship. The above totals 33 ships. (B) In the port: one gunboat each at floating piers No. 40, No. 30, No. 27, No. 22, No. 18, No. 15, No. 13, and No. 9. One destroyer each at floating piers No. 38, No. 37, No. 8, No. 7, No. 6, No. 4, and No. 1. One *Fifth Unkai Maru* at floating pier No. 15. Two gunboats at floating pier No. 11.

The above totals two large battleships, four cruisers, 23 destroyers, 16 gunboats, 19 transport ships, and one Red Cross ship, totaling 65 ships.</p>
<p>It is confirmed that two large battleships, one named *Hongo* and the other *Hauna*, each with a displacement of 27,000 tons, suddenly arrived at the Yangtze River estuary yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>The Heroic Sacrifice of Battalion Commander Zhou in the Battle of the City Center</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that on the morning of the 7th of this month, after the enemy landed at Qiujiang Wharf, they fiercely attacked our city center defense positions. Zhou Jian, the battalion commander of the first battalion of the ××× regiment of our ××× division, was directing operations in the Shenjiazhai area at the time. The enemy continuously bombarded our defensive works with artillery, and all were damaged. Our loyal and brave soldiers defended their positions with their flesh and blood, preventing the enemy from gaining a foothold. After four hours of stalemate, the enemy fired more than a thousand shells, and we had suffered more than half of our casualties. Battalion Commander Zhou was also unfortunately hit by several bullets, but he continued to direct the battle despite his injuries. The soldiers, seeing this, were extremely motivated, calmly responding, and vowing to live or die with the position. In the fierce battle until 2:00 PM, the enemy infantry surged forward, and we were outnumbered and our position was breached. At this time, Battalion Commander Zhou had already fallen to the ground due to his serious injuries, but he still used his pistol to kill many enemies, until his ammunition was exhausted and he was exhausted, and he was finally brutally murdered by the enemy and martyred, completing his great cause of defending the country and guarding its territory. This spirit of loyalty and bravery in fighting the enemy for the country is deeply admired by the enemy, even in their madness.</p>
<h3>Our Military Spokesperson Refutes the Japanese Consul General's Statement</h3>
<p>Vainly Attempts to Shift the Responsibility for the Shanghai War onto Us; Has Long Forgotten Violating the Shanghai Agreement</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that Okamoto, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, issued a statement to foreign reporters the day before yesterday, strongly concealing and shifting the responsibility for the Shanghai war. Our military spokesperson issued a statement yesterday refuting it, saying, "I am unwilling to make many refutations to the Japanese Consul General's lengthy statement, which attempts to shift the responsibility for the Shanghai war onto our side. However, the Japanese Consul General's admission of occupying Baziqiao is already a violation of the Shanghai Agreement signed in the 21st year of the Republic [1932]. The Japanese Consul General seems to have forgotten another violation of the Shanghai Agreement, which was when the Japanese side claimed that Chinese forces had kidnapped soldier Miyazaki when he went missing, and sent armed troops to invade Zhabei. However, it was later proven that Miyazaki had deserted on his own, and the Japanese military commander issued an apology. As for the Japanese side's accusations against foreign newspapers, I believe that this kind of blatant slander is useless."</p>
<h3>*Zilin Western News* Publishes Article Sternly Criticizing</h3>
<p>The *Zilin Bao* yesterday published an article written by the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Okamoto. It was a long and elaborate piece, no less than ten thousand words, recounting the facts that led to the Shanghai war. He blamed China for violating its word and criticized many foreign journalists for demeaning themselves, making untrue records of the war news, issuing prejudiced opinions, defending the legitimacy of the Japanese army using the concession as a base of operations, and finally stating that Japan was not the enemy of the Chinese people and sincerely wished to cultivate the closest possible relationship with China. He claimed that the true enemies of the Chinese people were the Nanjing clique and their Chinese and foreign followers who were bought with money. He also said that Japan was not good at propaganda, while the Chinese and their foreign spokespersons hired with money were engaged in harmful propaganda against Japan in Geneva and elsewhere, deceiving the world with false words, which the Japanese disdained to do. According to the reporter, the two countries of China and Japan are unfortunately engaged in war. Right and wrong have long been a matter of public record, as evidenced by the unanimous denunciation of Japan by major newspapers around the world in recent days.</p>
<p>Is this all because of Chinese money? Okamoto even said that Japan disdained to engage in propaganda around the world, so why did Okamoto draft this long article and publish it in foreign newspapers? And why has the Japanese government recently decided to send special envoys to various major countries in the world to lobby? Okamoto probably thinks that his countrymen are all bad at propaganda, and he alone is good at it. The most ridiculous thing is to say that Japan is not the enemy of the Chinese people, and sincerely wishes to cultivate the closest possible relationship with the Chinese people, and that the true enemies of the Chinese people are the Nanjing clique, etc. Fortunately, Japan still sincerely wishes to cultivate the closest possible relationship with the Chinese people, and yet its planes drop large numbers of bombs on our civilians every day. Are these gifts for cultivating the closest possible relationship? The two countries have not yet declared war, and in fact have not yet broken off diplomatic relations, but Okamoto actually refers to our National Government as a clique. His insult to our government is such that insulting our government is insulting all the people of our country. Will the world befriend those who insult the government and slaughter and destroy compatriots? Today, all the people of our country have</p>
<p>united</p>
<p>behind the government to resist the war. Even the Communists, who have always been at odds with the government, have abandoned their claims and listened to the government's command to drive out the brutal invaders. Yet Okamoto still utters such crazy words. How ignorant! The reporter originally intended to translate Okamoto's original text to offer it to readers and refute it point by point. However, the reporter disdains to waste time and defile his writing, so he only gives a brief written criticism of the most absurd points. Furthermore, China and Japan are now in a state of hostility, and the reporter's statements may inevitably be regarded as personal opinions, which are not as fair and powerful as the comments of a third party. The *Zilin Western News* also wrote an editorial on Okamoto's article, titled "An Untamable Beast," sternly refuting it. The translation is recorded below, which is enough to show that justice has not been extinguished, right and wrong have their own public opinion, and no matter how clever the arguments, what is the use?</p>
<p>*Zilin Bao* Daily</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto laboriously demonstrates, proving everything, and what many people are trying to deny, namely, that the Chinese government in North China was forced by the Japanese's unprovoked aggression to decide on a political and military situation where it could not simultaneously resist in North China and fiercely attack the Japanese army in the Shanghai area. What Okamoto said in his article, that he, representing the Japanese government in Shanghai, tried his best to prevent Shanghai from being devastated by war in the weeks before the outbreak of the Shanghai war, may also be given sincere approval. The severity of the Japanese Marines incident showed obvious mitigation, which can be used as evidence. And it also received the cooperation of the Shanghai Municipal Government within its capabilities to assist it. It is only natural that Okamoto wants to place all the blame for the gradual increase in tension in the Shanghai situation and the violation of the Songhu Agreement on China's shoulders. In fact, he completely ignores the Japanese navy stationed in Shanghai since January 28th,</p>
<p>trampling Shanghai,</p>
<p>the power of the Public Concession's Municipal Council, boasting of the preparation of military force for the garrison, and gradually turning Hongkou and Yangshupu into Japanese territory. All of these have become a clear threat to security, for which the security team permitted by Japan was established. In recent years, various disputes have occurred in this port (several of which can be said to be simple and illusory), and the senior officials of the Municipal Council have needed vigilance completely beyond the scope of their inherent intentions to deal with them. No one who remembers these incidents can close their eyes to a kind of atmosphere in the overall situation. This kind of atmosphere is naturally ignored by Okamoto, but it is actually most relevant to the fair assessment of the cases involved. The responsibility for violating the Songhu Agreement, if the above points are not taken into account, especially the arguments on the Chinese side, it is impossible to achieve satisfactory success in making careful adjustments. The debate of small countries, that is, the meetings of the joint committee that Okamoto firmly trusted, has become a mechanism due to circumstances not completely under the control of the Japanese, emphasizing the recording of Japanese protests and lightly monitoring both parties' compliance with the agreement.</p>
<p>Okamoto elaborates</p>
<p>that his trust in maintaining the effectiveness of the cooperation he has given in Shanghai has reached a certain extent. Japan's good intentions cannot be denied. Okamoto risked severely damaging his position, and the rapid increase of Chinese troops obviously made the number of garrison troops that the Japanese naval commander could deploy appear to be smaller in comparison. The reinforcement of the Chinese security team and the weapons it possessed could be regarded as a technical destruction of the Songhu Agreement, but Japan's militarism frequently put pressure on the Nanjing government, and the activities of the Japanese in the concession were also a reflection of this pressure. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to say that the situation when the Songhu Agreement was signed is very different from today. In essence, China, whether in Shanghai, eastern Hebei, or Beiping, has fallen into the position of a small beast. This beast, because it is easily attacked, has become an</p>
<p>untamable</p>
<p>beast, and seeks to defend itself. Regarding this matter, Okamoto's personal conscience is naturally clear, so the trend of Chinese affairs since "September 18th" has forced Japanese spokespersons to carefully elaborate on the issue of violating the agreement, and Okamoto should be forgiven for failing to recognize this point. Therefore, comments mentioning the Chinese authorities' attention to consolidating their defenses are easily met with cold treatment by critics. They should remember the arbitrary demands of the Japanese army and navy representatives in Shanghai and North China in order to command the Chinese people and increasingly control Chinese territory. Although this kind of invasion, "even Tokyo's clever new concept towards China," has failed to develop as desired, it has never stopped advancing, and in fact has forced its victims to resist to the death. How can Okamoto study the overall situation in this port and ignore this fundamental fact?</p>
<p>Okamoto also said</p>
<p>that the great powers cannot shirk their negligence in failing to convene a round table conference to discuss the future status of Shanghai. His words may have some sympathy, but it should be known that in addition to the world affairs they have to deal with, the great powers feel that Japan's policy of long-term aggression has made it impossible to hold such a discussion. Their opposition to considering a demilitarized zone is also for this reason, because this move already has a prototype in the shadow of the January 28th attack on Shanghai, and in the discussion, the entire issue of Japanese intentions implied by Japan's continuous prior aggressions in North China has to be raised, so it cannot obtain practical results. They may have encountered such difficulties, or it may be more beneficial to Shanghai, but no one dares to take such action to obtain results, especially because the Public Concession has been trying to seek Japanese cooperation to solve the problems of road construction outside the boundary and factory inspection,</p>
<p>but it has been met with setbacks.</p>
<p>Okamoto clearly explained that Japan is a country that is not good at publicizing its views. There is no need to argue with this statement, because what undermines Okamoto's efforts to seek the truth is none other than Japan's own actions in China over the past six years. Okamoto even dared to go beyond the scope of the Shanghai incident and attack the personnel of the Nanjing government, which is also not fair. Even if his rich rhetoric of condemnation is recognized as justified by some, (the *Zilin Bao* really dare not agree with this view) it should be questioned whether an allied country that wishes to cultivate the closest possible relationship with the Chinese people should descend on the coasts of these people with a large army and arbitrarily slaughter and destroy, and directly say that it is doing this with the profitable desire to change their leaders. Okamoto's powerful point does not fit the context, because he attributes the crimes of the Chinese government to the Chinese people's lack of political or national conscience, and makes them bear this heavy responsibility, so it is no wonder that the Japanese army fighting in China today cannot clearly distinguish between what Okamoto calls the enemy and what Okamoto considers to be friends.

<h3>Model Brigade of Military Training Students Presents Sword to General Wang Jingjiu</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Expresses Gratitude, Trains, Admonishes, and Comforts, and States that the Final Victory Will Surely Belong to Us</p>
<p>The Model Brigade of National Military Training Students in this city was originally composed of students who received training from the former Student Training Corps of this city. The students of the brigade, because the former commander of the corps, Mr. Wang Jingjiu, led his troops in Shanghai to heroically resist the war and served the country, specially raised funds to cast a sword and sent more than thirty representatives, including Jiang Yunhui, on a previous day. Led by Luo Kelun, deputy commander of the Student Battlefield Service Corps of this city's training students, and Wang Pingruo, the commander of the brigade, they traveled to the front to present it to Mr. Wang in person, expressing the brigade's support and condolences. The dedication inscription of the brigade and Mr. Wang's admonition are recorded below.</p>
<p>Dedication Inscription</p>
<p>The brutal sun wreaks havoc, the war of resistance begins, our public leads the troops to Shanghai, heroically resists the war, and establishes miraculous feats, shaking the world. The students have long been nurtured and personally received Jun's instructions. The spring breeze turns into rain, and the inspiration is especially deep. We respectfully raise funds to cast Zhao and respectfully present it to Jun. In order to express our respect, we humbly wish to further exert divine power, kill all the Japanese thieves, glorify my Xia Hua, and lay the foundation for billions of years of infinite foundation. The sweat of the horse can be expected in the near future. We respectfully offer the dedication inscription and respectfully wish you health.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's Admonition</p>
<p>Gentlemen, today I see you coming here at the risk of your lives with great enthusiasm to present the sword. In addition to expressing my gratitude, I also see that you have a deep memory of me. Tracing back to the separation from the Training Corps, it has been several months. I have received more than a few words of comfort from my fellow students. Some have been replied to by letter, and some have not had time to reply due to busy military affairs. Now I hear that under the leadership of Regiment Commander Li, Deputy Regiment Commander Luo, and Brigade Commander Wang, you have formed this strong and effective anti-war group, the Model Brigade. I have not even had time to participate, and I am deeply sorry. As for the war situation of our army, it has been detailed in the newspaper and will not be repeated. The only thing that is hateful, hateful, and pitiful is the enemy's running dogs, the traitors who are the scum of our nation, who act as accomplices and willingly fall into the enemy's poisonous scheme of "using Chinese to control Chinese." But we have recognized that the enemy's internal structure has indeed collapsed, and the economy is experiencing serious panic. Some of the traitors have also realized their mistakes and turned against them. At the same time, our officers and soldiers are determined to exterminate this stubborn bandit and eat them for breakfast. The final victory will surely belong to us. I hope that you will work hard.</p>
<h3>*English Great American Evening News* Criticizes Enemy's Hypocritical Behavior</h3>
<p>Contradictory Words and Deeds, Why Not Frankly Admit It</p>
<p>The editorial of the *English Great American Evening News* of this city on the evening of the 24th, titled "Why Not Be Open and Aboveboard," ridiculed the Japanese's ghostly behavior. The newspaper stated, "Japan's note regarding the injury of Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British ambassador to England, has been delayed for a long time. The reply only expressed deep regret for the injury of Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, and the authorities in London have considered it satisfactory. We, who are outsiders, should not nitpick and make rash accusations. It is true that we do not want to hear about disputes between Britain and Japan, and it is a good thing that everything can be resolved satisfactorily. However, what is most interesting and important in Japan's conquests is Japan's guarantee that it has instructed the Japanese army in China to do its utmost to protect the safety of non-combatants. The meaning of this instruction is quite puzzling. When we look back at the records of the past few days and weeks, we have not found that the Japanese army has paid attention to the safety of Chinese non-combatants. Even their foreign non-combatants have expressed deep concern, but foreign nationals traveling by railway or highway or living in cities such as Nanjing and Guangzhou have not been relieved by the Japanese's concern. The Japanese's arbitrary bombing of anyone's vehicles and civilian residential areas of a non-military nature is in contradiction with the section on "ensuring the safety of non-combatants with the utmost caution." What is the purpose of the Japanese's hypocrisy? Why not frankly admit that this is not a war but a terrorist campaign that disregards all public laws?"</p>
<h3>Corpse Discovered at Jiangxi Road Intersection</h3>
<p>Verified to be Japanese Soldiers Killed by Rifles</p>
<p>At 10:30 yesterday morning, a Western employee of the Sanitary Department of the Municipal Council was investigating sanitation in Deyu Lane at the intersection of Jiangxi Road North and Haining Road when he suddenly smelled an extremely strange odor coming from the house at No. 38. He became suspicious and went inside to check, and found two men dead in the house. He reported it to the Huishi Police Station, which ordered detectives to transport the two corpses to the morgue. Yesterday, the prosecutor of the First Special Court and forensic doctor Zhang Yan went to verify that the two men were Japanese soldiers killed by rifles. There were gun holes in their backs, and they had been killed for many days, so they were in a state of decay. Because it was impossible to find out the names and families of the deceased, it was ordered that Pushan Villa should take care of the funeral. This also shows one of the brutal acts of the Japanese army violating humanity and wantonly killing innocent civilians who are non-combatants.</p>
<h3>Support Association Collects Public Opinions</h3>
<p>The Design Committee of the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, in order to gather ideas from all sources, established a Public Opinion Collection Office to solicit various opinions from the public on resisting the enemy and saving the country. Since its establishment, the office has received a large number of opinion letters from various parties. The association has carefully handled each opinion, and after registering it, the association will carefully review it. Those that need detailed research will be handed over to the association's various specialized research groups for separate research. In addition to those that are already in progress, the association has sent letters to the relevant agencies for reference and implementation. It is hoped that compatriots across the country can send their research findings on various issues related to resisting the enemy and saving the country to the Opinion Collection Office of the association at any time. The temporary address is Room 508, Zhonghui Tianlou, 147 Edward Road.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Li Vitoff's Speech at the League of Nations Assembly</h3>
<p>Aggression is More Brazenly Displaying its Ugly Face, the League of Nations Should Take Decisive Action on Acts of Aggression, Only Collective Prevention of Aggression Can Guarantee Peace</p>
<p>[Moscow] Mr. Li Vitoff made a speech at the League of Nations General Assembly on the 21st of this month, saying, "The sins that we mentioned here a year ago are still poisoning the international atmosphere and corroding the League of Nations. Aggression has not only not disappeared in theory and practice, but has become more prominent, more brazenly displaying its ugly face, and showing new and more violent forms. This kind of aggression, in addition to the original masked form in Southwestern Europe, has added a more frank form in Asia. Two member states of the League of Nations are suffering from the aggression of foreign land, sea, and air forces. Merchant ships and warships of third countries have become targets of all possible attacks. Major sea lanes have been harmed by pirates by sea and air. International trade is being wantonly ruined. Valuable goods are being seized and sunk at will. Large numbers of crew members are being arrested and killed. Maritime bandits are rampant and lawless. The basic principles of international law have been trampled on without any remainder.</p>
<p>"On the Asian continent, a country has invaded neighboring China without declaring war and without any reason or justification, sending 100,000 troops to land and block the coast, completely paralyzing one of the world's largest commercial centers, and although this activity is still in its early stages, no one can predict what will happen in the future. In Europe, another country, Spain, has entered the second year of foreign troops invading. Its beautiful capital, Madrid, and other cities are being subjected to the most cruel bombings every day. The loss of life is countless, and material and cultural destruction is complete."</p>
<p>The League of Nations has now been asked to guarantee the sovereignty and integrity of member states, safeguard peace and international order, guarantee the sanctity of international treaties, and respect international law, but now it is indifferent and inactive. Not only that, but now there is a prevailing view that the main thing is to protect the League of Nations itself at all costs, so that it will not be affected by such major events and will be isolated from them, like a weak woman. Starting from this tender attitude of cherishing internationalism, a wrong view has arisen, thinking that the League of Nations is powerless to resist aggression, arbitrary behavior, illegal activities, and international banditry, because the countries engaged in these activities are not within the alliance. This view assumes that resistance to aggression must cooperate with the aggressor himself in order to succeed. This kind of cooperation has been tested in practice. The Spanish issue has been brought up by the League of Nations and handed over to the so-called Non-Intervention London Committee, a special organization, in order to invite the cooperation of the main ringleaders who cannot tolerate the spirit of Geneva. The results of this experiment are very clear and everyone knows that the London Committee has accomplished nothing. Although the import of arms into Spain has been formally prohibited, the supply of arms to the rebels for land, sea, and air operations has not stopped, and it is being carried out by the state. Although it has been stipulated that foreigners are not allowed to go to Spain to participate in the war, tens of thousands of people who have received military training, entire divisions of regular troops, equipped with full equipment and officers, are still being sent to support the rebels. In addition, there are foreign warships patrolling the west coast, assisting the rebels in patrolling, and bombing Spanish ports. Speaking of this, who can mention non-intervention in Spain without ridicule?</p>
<p>"The so-called organization that liberates itself from the spirit of Geneva and adapts to the needs of universalism, its activities have resulted as described above. On the other hand, we have the experience of Montreux and the recent Nyon Conference. Although these two conferences do not conform to universalism, that is, there are no countries that should be invited in accordance with what they have heard and believed, they were able to complete their work quickly. Thus, the conclusion is very clear, that the problem is not in the so-called universalism, but in the fact that the countries participating in any international organization or conference, although their respective national interests are quite different, should ultimately unite with each other under a common universal concept, this concept is the concept of peace, the concept of respecting the independence of others, the concept of abolishing the use of force as an instrument of national policy, the concept that is the basis of the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. We all know that there are now three countries that have denied this concept, and in recent years these three countries have invaded other countries.</p>
<p>The political systems, ideologies, and levels of material culture of these three aggressor countries are different, but they all cite the same motive as the reason for their aggression - anti-communism. Their rulers believe that they only need to shout the mantra of "Anti-Comintern" and all their international sins should be forgiven. They declare that communism has been eradicated in their country and there is no danger, so they pour out their love to other countries, no matter how far or near, claiming that their mission is to help other countries eliminate communism, and they will use all their land, sea, and air power to achieve this goal. They are not only willing to use their military and financial power, but also willing to make their people endure hunger and cold in order to obtain sufficient arms to help other countries eradicate communism. What is this? It is nothing more than openly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries by force and completely disregarding the independence of other countries.</p>
<p>I now ask you, gentlemen, if other countries also embrace this theory and send troops to each other, imposing their own political systems on the other, what will the world situation be like? However, the countries that created this theory sometimes give us a more concrete explanation than the slogan of anti-communism. We then realize that the so-called anti-communism also has a geological meaning, that is, the desire for tin, zinc, mercury, copper, and their mineral resources, but this is not recorded in any encyclopedia.</p>
<p>And when this explanation is not sufficient, anti-communism is further explained as the desire for favorable trade. What is even more, the scope of this anti-communist slogan is constantly expanding. When some people mention that the Bolshevik regime should be eliminated, they often add the words "similar regimes" under that regime. We also often hear that all democratic and parliamentary countries are on the verge of Bolshevization. In this way, it is not far off to make great contributions to this type of country and save them from the realm of destruction, hoping to be the same as Spain. China is an example. In the concrete sense of the parliamentary system, China is difficult to be called a parliamentary system country. However, today's aggressors against China also use the slogan of anti-communism. At the same time, in Europe, we also see that all countries that are generally recognized as the next target of aggression are pre-labeled as already Bolshevik or under Bolshevik influence. Any country that can be targeted by an aggressor country can be called Bolshevik, because in fact there is no need for evidence, as long as it is consistently promoted in newspapers and public speeches every day, the basis for which is that deception only needs to be repeated again and again to become the truth.</p>
<p>I think it is time to eliminate this dangerous incitement and tool of aggression. All countries that sincerely uphold peace should declare to those parrots who sit high in the halls of power that no matter how many times they repeat it every day, nonsense is still nonsense, no matter what slogan it is decorated with on the outside, aggression is still aggression, no matter what anti-communism means, whether it is mineralogical, commercial, strategic, or all of them, any actions under its disguise, such as aggression, armed intervention, annexation of neighboring countries, and violation of international treaties, will not be recognized by the international community. At the same time, we should also declare to those who promote the crazy hatred of humanitarians that they can never be called supporters of human interests, those who revive the most barbaric heretical theories of the Middle Ages can never speak for modern Europe, those who burn the most beautiful achievements of the human spirit, abuse the most noble representatives of the scientific and literary worlds, and are despised by the whole world, are ranting about saving civilization and taking the opportunity to organize crusades to attack others, and they do not realize how ridiculous their ugliness is. If we can declare this, it will be a great contribution to peace.</p>
<p>"A few days ago, in a movement to promote the legality of aggression against Spain, a new absurd slander was put forward, claiming that the Soviet Union was attempting to conquer Spain, or at least gain political influence over Spain, thereby disrupting the balance of power in the Mediterranean. Regarding this, Spanish Prime Minister Negrin has stated a few days ago that throughout the conflict in Spain, the Soviet Union has never asked Spain for anything, and has no intention of anything in the past and now. The Soviet Union has no mineralogical, economic, or strategic intentions for Spain, and the so-called balance of power has not been considered at all. What the Soviet Union is concerned about is that any country should have the full right to decide its own political system and cannot be interfered with by foreign countries, especially by foreign troops. The Soviet Union also cannot allow others to establish new bases in Spain in order to invade the whole of Europe. From the beginning to the end, the Soviet Union has not recognized that the two sides in the Spanish civil war have equal rights, but the Soviet Union still participates in all non-interference agreements and proposals to prohibit non-Spanish people from participating in military operations. However, when concluding any international agreement, the Soviet Union naturally has the right to pay attention to itself so as not to be deceived, so that the agreement must be observed by one party, while the other party does not actually fulfill it. There is no need to talk about the threat to peace at present, because peace has already been broken, and undeclared wars are being waged on two continents, the impact of which is truly beyond anyone's control."</p>
<p>Mr. Li then discussed the task of the League of Nations, and should decisively criticize the view that "the only way to save the League of Nations is universalism," saying that he "resolutely opposes pursuing universalism at the cost of making further concessions to aggressors and refusing to guarantee member states. We discussed this issue at last year's League of Nations General Assembly. At that time, I pointed out that those who are not in our hands are actually those who oppose universalism in principle. The question is, can universalism be done, what price is needed, and what positive effects can it produce under the current conditions? Is the League of Nations really helpless without this universalism?</p>
<p>"We must not forget and truly regret that a powerful country like the United States has not yet joined the League of Nations. We deeply know that the American people love peace and hate war. We deeply know that the President and Secretary of State of the United States are faithful to the ideals of the League of Nations. We deeply know how much the strength of the League of Nations will increase if the United States can join. However, I believe that if we think that the United States is already prepared to join, but is unwilling to open its mouth and is waiting for this side to ask or invite, it is disrespectful to the United States. A country that knows the importance of its power will never focus on such a trivial matter of face. I firmly believe that if the US government discovers that it can join the League of Nations under any conditions, it will never wait for our inquiry or invitation, but will have a way to let us know its intentions.</p>
<p>"I have this feeling that those who talk about universalism really mean those countries that were originally in the League of Nations but have now angrily withdrawn, and whose policies I have described to you. We are now being advised to ask those countries that openly promote and practice aggression, openly interfere in the internal affairs of other countries by force, and openly violate international treaties, how the League of Nations can resist aggression and guarantee the independence of all member states. Isn't their entire policy a clear and obvious answer to the inquiry proposed this time?</p>
<p>"This General Assembly must resolve major and urgent issues. We have been asked to help two member states that have been invaded. This request has placed the League of Nations before a major test. If the League of Nations never assumes its obligations, and always expresses helplessness, it will never be able to maintain any authority, nor will it be able to maintain its existence. I dare to affirm that the League of Nations, even in its current state, can give Spain and China greater assistance than they have requested, thereby not only not increasing, but reducing new international disputes. What can and should the League of Nations do before aggression? We have heard a saying from a British writer that the best way to avoid temptation is to succumb to temptation. I know that there are quite a few political saints of this kind who also believe that the best way to avoid aggression is to succumb to aggression. They accuse the Spanish people of not making heroic resistance to the rebel generals and their backers. They believe that the smartest way for China is to accept the aggressor's ultimatum-like demands without a fight and automatically become a vassal state of that country, but the League of Nations is not established to offer this kind of advice, and if the League of Nations does not offer this kind of advice, but is always passive, self-pitying, lamenting its own weakness, the incompleteness of its universalism, and the fact that countries that practice aggression do not follow its resolutions and cannot participate in its meetings, then the League of Nations has no reason to exist.</p>
<p>"This kind of path has been tried for a long time, and the result has led to the situation that all speakers in this forum have cited as regrettable. This path has caused some member states to lose extremely large territories and tens of millions of people, and caused other countries to completely lose their national status. Because of the League of Nations' passivity in the Manchurian conflict, the attack on Abyssinia occurred a few years later. Because the League of Nations' activities in the Abyssinian incident were insufficient, it prompted the experiment in Spain. Because the League of Nations was completely unable to assist Spain, it is now encouraging a new attack on China. Thus, in five years, we have had four acts of aggression. We have all seen that aggression, because it has not been stopped, has spread from one continent to another, and each time the scope has become wider and wider. This is an iron fact that no one can deny now.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, I firmly believe that if the League of Nations adopts a decisive policy towards an act of aggression, other incidents will completely disappear. Only in this way can all countries realize that aggression has no benefits and aggression should not be adopted. Only in this way can former member states knock on our door, and we will gladly welcome them to join. We will not ask about the world view, nor will we ask about the domestic political system, because the League of Nations recognizes the peaceful coexistence of all existing political systems, so that our common ideal of a universal League of Nations can be realized and will always be an instrument of peace. But we can never complete this ideal by issuing questionnaires. We can only achieve it by collectively preventing aggression and collectively guaranteeing peace, and peace is necessary for all of us, and its benefits are shared by all of us."</p>
<p>At the end of Mr. Li's speech, the whole audience applauded thunderously, and many representatives immediately rushed to congratulate him. Representatives and newspaper reporters in the outer corridor rushed to the Soviet delegation and the newspaper reporter delegation, saying that this speech was the most powerful one they had heard in the many years since the establishment of the League of Nations. Even people from all walks of life who had no good feelings towards the Soviet delegation admitted that the impression of this speech was extremely deep. (TASS telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Economic Construction During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xianwen</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "War is fierce and dangerous." War and destruction are inseparable. To talk about economic construction during this period of the War of Resistance seems to be ignorant of the situation, but we must firmly remember that this War of Resistance is a long-term war. We cannot only have long-term destruction without talking about construction. In fact, we must work hard on construction at the same time in order to support the War of Resistance in the long term and win victory in the War of Resistance. Then, how should the economy be constructed during this period of the War of Resistance? This is certainly not something that this article can fully describe. Now I can only raise a few more important questions.</p>
<p>In peacetime, people advocate freedom as much as they want. Now we must implement control. The current urgent task is that the government must have a specialized agency to take responsibility for planning and controlling economic construction during the War of Resistance. Based on correct plans, strict control should be implemented. There can no longer be "disorder" and "each doing its own thing." As for the outline of the plan and the goals of control, they can also be briefly stated.</p>
<p>First, the enemy has blocked our coast, from Qinhuangdao in the north to Beihai in the south. Under this situation, our foreign trade will naturally be greatly affected. The reduction of customs revenue is even more of a trivial matter. During this period, for all the special products that have always been sold to foreign countries, we must still use the available land and sea transportation routes to try to continue exporting. This is not only related to the rise and fall of our country's industry, but also can be used to increase international income, consolidate international credit, and enable us to buy more military-necessary weapons and ammunition and daily necessities from overseas during the war. As for import trade, we must also have a plan. Which goods can be completely dispensed with (such as decorative items). Absolutely no imports are allowed. Which goods can be substituted for by other goods. Relatively no imports are allowed. Which goods can be produced by themselves. Take the opportunity to develop the country's industry. If there are goods that must be purchased from foreign countries, it is appropriate to purchase them from which country and use which method to purchase them. All must have a plan and statistics.</p>
<p>Second, in the past, our cities and villages were developing in a deformed way. Most of our national industries, which have a very weak foundation, are concentrated in the coastal commercial ports. Now these places have become war zones or will become war zones. Even if our factories are not destroyed by the enemy, they will not be able to start work. This blow to our national industry is certainly very serious. But we should not be too pessimistic. As long as there is a plan and struggle, the future is full of light. Because our industry has always been oppressed by the goods of advanced capitalist countries, especially by the enemy's shameless smuggled goods, and there is no way to develop. Now that the war has started, enemy goods are naturally cut off. The enemy's factories in my coastal cities are also suffering the same disaster. And the goods of advanced capitalist countries are also affected by wartime transportation and other factors. It is not easy to import. We can take advantage of this opportunity to lay a solid foundation for our national industry. All factories that cannot start work in our war zones must of course be moved to the inland. Even factories near the war zones must also be prepared for this. As for which factories should be moved first, which factories can be delayed, where should which factories be located, and where should which factories be located, all this depends on correct planning and strict control. In addition to moving old factories, what kind of new factories should be added and where should they be located? Similarly, there needs to be planning and control. And all the difficulties caused by moving old factories or adding new factories must be solved effectively with the greatest efforts. Another question that is closely related to the development of national industry in the inland is how to make the capital and skilled workers concentrated in the coastal cities return to the inland. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, it is certainly a bad phenomenon to transport capital to foreign countries. It is also not a proper way to send skilled workers back to their hometowns as general refugees.</p>
<p>Third, it is also because of the deformed development of our country's cities and villages in the past that China, which has been based on agriculture for decades, has had to import huge amounts of agricultural products from foreign countries every year, while the amount of wasteland has increased. Now, during this period of the War of Resistance, the import of foreign agricultural products is naturally not as easy as in the past. This is certainly an opportunity to revive our agricultural economy. But we must also have a plan and control. Which agricultural products urgently need to be produced, which places are suitable for planting, and whether the result of farmers desperately planting is still nothing except paying rent and taxes, or even insufficient. Whether the supply and demand of agricultural products can be closely linked. It is said that there is a large amount of cotton near Pudong that is suffering from nowhere to transport and sell it. How should these difficulties be overcome? All of these are major issues in the economic construction of agriculture during the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>What has been said above about economic construction during the War of Resistance only talks about agriculture, industry, and commerce. To make these constructions effective, we must of course also talk about the issues of transportation, finance, and finance during the War of Resistance. But due to space limitations, I will ask for correction in another article. Finally, the reporter wants to add a word. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, most intellectuals have felt that they have nothing to do and are depressed and anxious. Some intellectuals seem to be extremely busy, organizing many groups on top of each other, attending several meetings a day, and speaking at every meeting. If they think about the effect of being so busy, they may also be depressed and anxious. But we must remember that this War of Resistance is a long-term war, and we must be long-term to be sure of victory. We should divide the work and cooperate, talk less empty talk, and do more practical things. Let others do what others have done and can do. We should adhere to the spirit of "seeking truth from facts" and "burying our heads in hard work," on the one hand waiting for the government's dispatch, and at the same time doing more work within our own scope. For example, the various economic construction issues during the War of Resistance mentioned above are enough for the research of some economic students. Will we still say that there is nothing to do?</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Nanking, Italy and Russia Also Protest</h3>
<p>Britain Will Protest Japanese Planes Bombing Guangzhou, Japan Drafts Reply to US Protest</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with reporters from various countries today. After various questions, regarding the bombing of Nanjing, it was learned that the German Consul in Japan visited Director Tōgō of the European and Asian Affairs Bureau on the 20th, and the Italian and Soviet Consuls General in Shanghai visited Japanese Consul General Okamoto on the 21st, all expressing their opposition to the bombing and reserving the right to claim compensation for damages. (Central News Agency Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>[London] Someone asked diplomatic figures whether the British government would protest to Japan about the bombing of Guangzhou by Japanese planes. The diplomatic figures only said that this was possible, but that no decision had been made at present. As for the issue of Japanese planes bombing Chinese civilians, the British government had already expressed its views in a note to the Japanese government three days ago when Japan bombed Nanjing.

<h3>League of Nations Advisory Committee; Japan Does Not Participate</h3>
<p>Cabinet Decides Policy</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Chairman of the League of Nations Twenty-Three Nation Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Issue, Mr. Mendes, formally invited the Japanese government to participate in the committee via a letter delivered to the Japanese government on the 21st.  In response, Japanese foreign affairs authorities, after consultation, unanimously agreed that since its withdrawal from the League of Nations, the Japanese government has adopted a policy of non-cooperation with the League on political issues, limiting cooperation to humanitarian issues only. It was also felt that in the current circumstances, there was no need to change this policy, and that Japan should maintain a firm and independent stance to deal with the incident. Furthermore, if the League of Nations were to participate in or hear about the Sino-Japanese incident, it would only further complicate the situation.  As a result of these discussions, the policy was decided that the Imperial government would not dispatch representatives. This policy was explained by Foreign Minister Hirota at the cabinet meeting on the 24th, and after gaining the understanding of all cabinet members, a reply will be issued in the near future. (24th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to a statement made today by a Foreign Ministry spokesman, the Foreign Ministry is currently drafting a reply to the U.S. protest regarding the Japanese bombing of Nanjing. The general gist of the reply, which is expected to be issued within the week, is that the Japanese government has always respected the lives and property of all nations, and that the Japanese Air Force has already received such orders.  Furthermore, a second instruction will be issued this week, ordering them to pay attention to this point.  When asked what attitude the Foreign Ministry was taking towards the invocation of the Nine-Power Treaty by various countries, the spokesman only said that Japan had decided not to cooperate with the League of Nations on political issues. Moreover, Japan's policy towards China is that any third-party intervention is meddlesome. When asked whether Japan had used puppet troops in the war in China, the spokesman said that due to the threat from Chinese troops on the Manchurian border, they have indeed used a large number of Manchurian troops, but that there are also some Manchurian troops in other areas. (24th National News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Australian Commonwealth representative to the League of Nations, Bruce, suggested in Geneva yesterday that a conference be convened of all countries with interests in China to discuss the Far Eastern situation.  While the British government expressed sympathy for this suggestion, it did not feel it appropriate to act on it.  There are two reasons for this: ㊀ such a conference may not be able to take effective measures and would only serve to expose the inability of Western powers to resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict; ㊁ the United States, which is currently participating in the League of Nations General Assembly's Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue, would probably not be willing to participate in such a conference.  British officials recently stated that it is most appropriate for the Advisory Committee to handle the Far East issue at present.  The committee should be able to take effective measures to protect ordinary people and ensure the interests of foreigners, and may even strengthen the position of moderate elements within Japan who do not believe that military victory has lasting value.  British sources believe that China's resistance will be sustained, and that although the Japanese government is currently infatuated with military force and rejects mediation by other countries, it will eventually come to its senses and be willing to accept mediation. If so, the Advisory Committee should be able to facilitate this mediation work so that it can be effective. (20th Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Italy Will Not Increase Troops in Spain</h3>
<p>Has Provided Guarantees to France; Britain Welcomes Franco-Italian Talks</p>
<p>[London] The Italian Minister to Switzerland, Pova Scobber, provided guarantees to French Foreign Minister Delbos yesterday, stating that Italy has not continued to send volunteer soldiers to Spain. Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano also issued the same statement to British Chargé d'Affaires Ingram. Foreign Secretary Eden received French Ambassador Corbin this morning and told him that the British government is extremely satisfied with the progress of the Franco-Italian talks. As far as the general public is aware, the British government will temporarily allow France and Italy to negotiate independently, and talks will likely shift to a three-way negotiation between Britain, France, and Italy only after Mussolini returns from Berlin. The issue of the withdrawal of volunteers from both countries will be raised for discussion when the Adjustment Committee reconvenes in early October. Political figures here attach great importance to the current Franco-Italian talks, which were initiated by the Italian Prime Minister. It is believed that if Italy continues to send volunteer soldiers to Spain, the French government will abolish the current monitoring measures along the Franco-Spanish border. Therefore, the guarantee provided by the Italian authorities that they will not send volunteer soldiers to Spain in the future should be adhered to. (23rd Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Goes to Germany</h3>
<p>Train Is Bulletproof; Heavy Military and Police Presence Along the Route, Strict Investigation</p>
<p>[Rome] Prime Minister Mussolini departed for Germany this morning to visit Führer Hitler. The farewell was extremely grand, with military salutes to show respect.

<h3>U.S. Ambassador Johnson Describes Situation of Japanese Plane Attacking Beijing from the 'Luzon' Battleship</h3>
<p>Currently No Intention to Leave Nanjing Again</p>
<p>The personnel of the US Embassy in Nanjing are conducting business as usual today with no intent to leave the capital. There is a well-equipped bomb shelter near the embassy for when the Japanese planes attack. This was relayed to Reuters via a long-distance telephone call from US Ambassador Johnson. The US Ambassador claimed that on the night of September 20, the embassy staff moved to the American battleship, fearing that the capital would be destroyed by bombs. It would be better for them to be in a location where they could contact the outside world via phone and also have access to the highway. This idea spurred them to reside on the battleship Luzon, which was prepared to move but never left its original mooring. The embassy staff's actions were not prompted by any personal fear of danger. Other than Second Secretary Paxton, the rest of the staff, led by myself, went to the warship, and we returned to the embassy one day later. I was the one who made the decision and took the responsibility. When the Japanese planes bombed, the Americans residing in the embassy all took shelter in the bomb shelter nearby. The shelter was strongly constructed and could hold a hundred people. We are currently reinforcing the structure to increase its capacity and protection. The staff returned to the embassy with me at 3 or 4 PM on the 21st. There were no attacks that day, however, I witnessed an aerial battle on the deck of the Luzon. I saw a plane engaged in combat with another plane and then catch fire and crash downward, but I could not determine whether it was a Japanese or Chinese plane. The two planes engaged in combat high up in the sky. From below, they looked like two birds. On that day, I witnessed two Japanese attacks. The first attack seemed to target the Central Party Headquarters. I saw many bombs fall on the Party Headquarters and along the river. I believe the Party Headquarters building was definitely hit. I also saw bombs fall in the area near the capital's consulates and shops. When the Japanese planes were flying and dropping bombs, several anti-aircraft guns fired at them. After I returned to the embassy, I learned that an anti-aircraft shell had landed only twenty feet away from my residence in the garden, creating a hole in the ground. The gatehouse was hit by shrapnel. To my knowledge, not many people died in the Japanese air raid. The people's hatred of the enemy is still very intense, and they are very optimistic.

<h3>Reduced Boat Fares to Benefit Refugees</h3>
<p>Ningbo Fellow Townsmen's Association Sends Letter to Taikoo Company Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo route, after the Wah Yuen Shipping Company's Endeavor steamship was taken back for its own use, was succeeded by the New Peking steamship, which was also about to expire from its lease with the Ningshao Company, and will continue to operate the Shanghai-Ningbo route by the Taikoo Company from tomorrow. The ticket prices are reportedly 10 yuan per person in the first class, 5 yuan per person in the cabin class, and 3 yuan per person in the steerage class. The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai believes that the New Peking ship originally belonged to the Shanghai-Ningbo route, and that at this time of the Shanghai Incident, the ship's ticket prices should not be increased suddenly. Yesterday, the association sent a letter to the Taikoo Company to express its opinion. The original letter stated: "To the respectful management, now that your company's Peking steamship has continued to operate the Shanghai-Ningbo route after the Ningshao Company's lease has expired, maintaining transportation, we are deeply grateful. However, regarding the ticket prices, it is reported that the prices used during the Ningshao Company's lease are still being used, which is too expensive. Our association believes that China and the United Kingdom have always had friendly relations, and that your company has a Shanghai-Ningbo route, and our fellow countrymen have a particularly close relationship with your company. According to our association, the proceeds from ticket sales during the Ningshao Company's lease of your Peking ship, after deducting the lease fee, were used entirely for relief needs and were not for commercial purposes. At this time of evacuation, most people are desperate and will buy tickets, even if it is at a painful price, but this is not voluntary, and it is likely to create resentment in the future. We sincerely request that your company carefully consider the current environment and reduce the ticket prices for the Peking steamship to lighten the burden on our fellow countrymen who take the ship. We would be particularly grateful for this. Therefore, we are sending this letter specifically in the hopes that you will investigate, handle the matter, and provide a response." Respectfully, British Taikoo Company,</p>
<h3>Authorities Strictly Prohibit Battlefield Photography</h3>
<p>Violators Will Be Severely Punished According to Martial Law</p>
<p>It has come to our military's attention that some unscrupulous individuals often use clever methods to infiltrate our military positions under false pretenses, take military photos, and then provide them to the enemy for their use. This is extremely wicked. Therefore, starting yesterday, we have specially instructed all military and police personnel under our command to prohibit anyone from going to the battlefield to take photos. Anyone who deliberately violates this order and secretly carries cameras to take photos will be severely punished according to the articles of martial law once discovered in order to deter others and prevent military secrets from being leaked. In addition, we also hope that all circles will be especially cautious when reporting in writing, so as to avoid repeating the past danger of inadvertently providing the enemy with military information.</p>

<h3>Mass Employment of Unemployed Workers from Japanese Mills</h3>
<p>City West Federation Sends Letter to Various Mills Yesterday</p>
<p>Among the Shanghai West mills which have resumed operations successively during the war of resistance, there are now five Chinese-owned mills: Wing On, Hongzhang, Xinyu, Shenxin No. 2 Mill, and Shenxin No. 9 Mill. There are also two British-owned mills, Ewo and Charity Mill, which are very busy. The Shanghai City West Federation has learned that these mills will resume the night shift within the day and will recruit a large number of workers. Yesterday, they sent separate letters to the various mills, requesting that they give priority to employing unemployed workers from Japanese mills in order to provide relief. The original letter stated: "We admire your mills for resuming operations successively during the war of resistance, maintaining the livelihood of workers, and increasing production capacity. We have heard that you will be adding a night shift within the day and recruiting more people. The Committee is very pleased to hear this. It has been learned that there are over 60,000 to 70,000 unemployed workers from Japanese mills in this city, most of whom are young and strong and can endure hard labor. If they are allowed to wander and their livelihoods are cut off, it would be tantamount to severing the nation's vitality and losing the original intention of cultivating national strength. Therefore, we request that your factories treat everyone equally and employ them in large numbers to provide placement and relief. In terms of production, it can achieve the effect of skilled labor. In terms of the nation and society, there will be enormous gains and consequences. We hope you will take this into consideration and handle the matter accordingly. We would like to express our public friendship."</p>

<p>The Chinese Seamen's Union, in response to the resolution passed by the International Transport Workers' Federation in Paris on the 22nd, which advocated that seamen from all countries should continue to oppose aggressor nations in Europe and the Far East, has sent a cable to the Federation expressing its sincere support and suggesting that international seamen should unite and resolutely refuse any transportation orders from aggressor nations that are for the purpose of aggression. The original cable is recorded as follows: To the International Transport Workers' Federation in Paris and forwarded to all national seafarer groups: Since 1921, the aggressor nation in the Far East, Japanese imperialism, has repeatedly extended its evil hand, plundering millions of square miles of territory in our Northeast, enslaving tens of millions of our people, and swallowing the international interests that accompany them. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, North China and South China have been subjected to a full-scale invasion. Bombing, burning, and killing are unprecedented in ancient and modern times. It has already disregarded international law and various peace treaties. The reason for this is related to the soft and watchful attitude of friendly nations and the indifference of our workers to world affairs. We have learned that your federation and the seafarer groups of various countries have resolved to oppose aggressor nations in Europe and the Far East at the international conference. We Chinese seamen are deeply impressed. However, empty words are difficult to control demons. We sincerely hope that you will convey to the seafarer groups of various countries that all of us international seamen should unite and resolutely refuse any transportation orders from aggressor nations that are for the purpose of aggression. We should recognize that this type of order is only a chaotic order for a few military leaders of aggressor nations to satisfy their private desires and has no benefit to the entire country or the world. Therefore, we should not accept it. We should also enthusiastically strive for peace in Europe and the Far East. Such recent events as the sit-down strike of British crew members on the British ship Xiwenli in Hong Kong, refusing to transport Japanese goods, the refusal of Chinese crew members on the British ship Hubei in Qingdao to sail to Dalian, the brewing strike by seamen in Kobe, Japan, against the military leaders' invasion of China, and the Chicago Seamen's Union in the United Kingdom requesting that the government impose economic sanctions on Japan are all great achievements of international seamen truly striving for peace for mankind. In addition to representing the seamen throughout China and sending telegrams to the seamen of each ship to express our admiration, we are sending this telegram to respectfully request your instructions. We will not carry them out without your guidance. Yang Hu, special envoy of the Chinese Seamen's Union, together with the seamen throughout the country.</p>

<h3>Yesterday and Today There Were No Fierce Battles Along the Entire Line; Enemy Ships Concentrated at Liuhe in an Attempt to Land</h3>
<p>Intense Artillery Battles Occurred in Zhabei This Morning; Enemy Planes Dropped Bombs in Pudong and Nanshi</p>
<p>As of noon today, the war reports obtained by this newspaper from various sources are as follows: ㊀ The enemy continued to fiercely attack our positions east of Liuhang the day before yesterday (the 23rd). After an unsupported retreat, they concentrated heavy artillery to bombard that area. Our army's positions suffered slight damage, but our army still firmly held the original position. Yesterday (the 24th), the entire line was quiet with no fighting. ㊁ In recent days, our army has firmly held its positions, and the enemy has been at a loss. According to reliable information, more than ten enemy ships, including a battleship, have been concentrated from Liuhang to Maqiao, seemingly attempting to land and attack our rear. Our army's defenses in that area are solid, and the enemy will definitely not succeed. ㊂ Yesterday (the 24th) evening, there was artillery fire in the Baoshan Road area of Zhabei, but the artillery fire was sparse. The artillery fire from the Liuhang area stopped at 5:30 pm. Overnight, except for a few bursts of machine gun fire on Shishan Road, all areas were quiet.

<p>If the Enemy Reinforces and Attacks, We Will Deal Them a Heavy Blow</p>
<p>The enemy in the Yanghang area has been attacking our Liuhang front, near Yangmu Bridge, for days without success. It was not until dawn yesterday that they were unable to support the retreat, but they still concentrated heavy artillery fire. The fortifications built on our警戒Line were slightly damaged, but the morale was high, and we firmly held the original front line, confronting the enemy. This morning (the 25th), the entire line has become quiet. If the enemy reinforces and attacks again, we will meet them head-on with a heavy blow.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Recruits Volunteer Officers</h3>
<p>The First Batch Recruits 100 Infantry Officers; It Can Be Seen That the Enemy's Casualties Are Heavy and They Have Reached the End of Their Rope</p>
<p>The enemy launched a large-scale attack on our Pingjin and Shanghai. After our brave resistance, the enemy suffered heavy losses, especially among middle and lower-ranking officers. As a result of repeated recruitment of reinforcements, the original army officers are no longer sufficient for deployment. According to news from Tokyo, they have now begun to recruit volunteer officers. The first batch will recruit 100 infantry officers, with a deadline at the end of this month. Active officers or those with experience in their branch of service are eligible. After training, they will be employed from December.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Reconnoiter Pudong and Nanshi</h3>
<p>Dropped Several Bombs Near Qichang Wharf and Gaochang Temple</p>
<p>At about 8:00 this afternoon, four enemy planes flew over Pudong to reconnoiter, dropping four bombs near Qichang Wharf, destroying several civilian houses with minimal damage. At 10:00, they went to the Nanshi area to reconnoiter before flying away.</p>
<p>Seven enemy planes, from 7:00 to 10:00 this morning, circled over the Nanshi area, flying low to reconnoiter and strafing passersby with machine guns. They dropped a bomb near Gaochang Temple, which did not explode. According to military sources, the enemy will launch a large-scale bombing of Nanshi again.</p>
<p>From 8:30 to 11:00 this morning, multiple enemy reconnaissance planes, divided into teams of three, circled over the British and French Concessions, Pudong, Nanshi, Zhabei, and other places to reconnoiter. Three of them strafed downwards with machine guns when they reached the Nanshi area, but because they fired indiscriminately, there were no casualties.</p>
<p>Today the weather cleared up. Four enemy planes appeared over Shanghai again at around 8:00 in the morning, dropping more than ten bombs in Zhabei, Pudong, and western Shanghai, damaging several civilian houses and injuring several civilians. The Nanshi area remained calm.</p>

<p>Markets South of Tangqiao Return to Pre-War State; Civilian Boat Traffic South of Zhangjiabang Also Fully Restored</p>
<p>After the enemy's repeated attempts to attack Pudong failed, the enemy ships gathered in the Lujiazui area have also left. Only two or three planes are dispatched daily for harassment. Therefore, Pudong has not been as tense in recent days as it was a few days ago, and civilian boat traffic at the wharves south of Zhangjiabang has been fully restored. The markets south of Tangqiao have also returned to their pre-war state, and villagers are returning one after another.</p>
<h3>Artillery Fire Erupted in Zhabei This Morning</h3>
<p>At around 7:00 this morning, the enemy from the Hongkou city center area attacked our Zhabei garrison again. The enemy in the city center area bombarded us fiercely with cannons. The enemy in the front line rushed close to our army's positions. Our soldiers all jumped out of the trenches to meet the enemy. The enemy strafed with light machine guns, and our army also responded with heavy artillery, Guan guns, and mortars. For a time, the sound of artillery was deafening, and machine guns rattled. Our shells all landed in important areas such as Hongkou, Jiangwan Road, and the enemy's Marine Corps headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. The fierce battle lasted until about 10:00, when the enemy retreated without being able to hold on. Our army did not pursue.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships in the Huangpu River Erect Lookout Towers</h3>
<p>Ta Kung Pao said that the enemy ship "Izumo", which is moored at the second buoy in the Huangpu River off the Gonghexiang Wharf, fearing attacks from our land and air forces, has used various methods to defend itself. In addition to stealing many of our civilian boats, building a semi-circular defensive structure south of the ship, and dismantling the buoys in the Huangpu River, it has arbitrarily enclosed a waterway in the river area of the Japanese Consulate to prohibit ships from passing through. Starting today, a lookout tower has been erected on a wooden boat south of the ship, about ten meters from the shore and about three meters high. A machine gun is mounted on the tower to spy on our Pudong. Its tricks are becoming increasingly desperate, which is clearly visible.</p>

<h3>U.S. Asiatic Fleet Decides to Station in China to Protect Nationals</h3>
<p>Commander Yarnell Issues Broadcast Announcement</p>
<p>[Washington] The Navy Department has announced that Vice Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, has issued a broadcast by wireless to all U.S. ships in Chinese territorial waters, stating that as long as the current situation between China and Japan remains unchanged, the Asiatic Fleet will not leave Chinese waters. All warships will be stationed in Chinese ports to assist U.S. nationals in times of need. The locations of the warships will not be changed for the time being, unless U.S. nationals request special protection. The conclusion states, "U.S. warships are inevitably taking risks to assist and protect nationals, but these risks are not very serious. In any case, it is our duty and we will not hesitate." It is generally believed here that, judging from Vice Admiral Yarnell's announcement, the U.S.'s position on the situation in China seems to be strengthening. Secretary of State Hull declined to comment on this, but said that the government's policy of protecting nationals has not changed. As for Japan's decision to launch a large-scale bombing of Nanjing, the government lodged a protest with Japan yesterday, but it has not yet received a sincere response.

<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Peaceful Cities; Britain Lodges Strong Protest with Japan</h3>
<p>Protest Letter Sent to the U.S. Government for Reference</p>
<p>[London] British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, has been ordered by his government to lodge a strong protest with the Japanese government against the bombing of non-military targets in China, and to express the horror of the British people at the tragic loss of civilian lives in Guangzhou. Currently, the British public is united in anger at the indiscriminate bombing of non-combatants in China, and meetings are being held to pass resolutions. The Executive Committee of the League of Nations Union has also passed a resolution, requesting the government that, if the League of Nations Advisory Committee finds that Japan is responsible for the current war, all relevant countries should collectively boycott Japanese exports. Furthermore, the National Council of the Evangelical Free Churches of England has also passed a resolution, expressing horror and indignation at Japan's "horrific and inhumane atrocities" in bombing various parts of China. The British government has been requested to take all possible steps to stop the brutal acts from continuing, and to specifically explore a petition to the League of Nations Aviation Committee to find a way to abolish the possibility of air warfare. (Reuters dispatch from London on the 25th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the bombing of non-military targets by Japanese aircraft in various parts of China, U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, has been instructed to lodge a protest with the Tokyo government, stating that the recent bombings of Nanjing and Guangzhou by Japanese aircraft have resulted in the tragic deaths of a large number of civilians, news of which has been met with deep abhorrence by the people of England. In addition, Sir Robert Clive also explained to Foreign Minister Hirota that the Japanese government's reply to the incident of the attack on Ambassador Hugh Knatchbull-Hugessen had provided assurances that the safety of ordinary people would be respected, but the recent bombing incidents were in stark contrast to these promises and should be given attention by the Japanese government. The British protest letter has been sent to the U.S. government for reference. (Reuter dispatch from London on the 24th)</p>

<h3>The Ginza Incident in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Viciously Criticize the Military; Jintan Company Gives Away Lucky Charms</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence: The so-called Ginza incident, which was once regarded as quite serious, involved several soldiers who, every day, in the most bustling restaurants and bars in Ginza, Tokyo, made arguments and viciously criticized the military, and publicly propagated the inside stories of the military. This matter was heard by the Tsukiji Police Department, which sent people to investigate, only to find out that the leader was named Nakamura Goro, who lived in Shimodamachi, Kamata Ward. They sent people to search his home. Unexpectedly, Nakamura suddenly took out a military sword and randomly chopped the police officer, thus causing a major problem. Although Nakamura has now been arrested, his accomplices are being searched for, and the military believes that he must have a background, so Nakamura will be interrogated strictly.</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers are not only given "thousand-stitch belts" and lucky charms issued by shrines by relatives and friends to avoid bullets, but recently, Jintan Company has also been giving away lucky charms (as shown in the picture) to customers who buy Jintan, which can be said to be good at speculation. According to their advertisement: From August 4th to September 9th, a total of 611,540 lucky charms were given away. The superstition of the Japanese people and the cowardice of the Japanese soldiers can be seen from this. It is also said: This charm can not only avoid bullets, but can also predict the longevity of martial fortune, and has been quite effective in the battlefield many times. Their childish thinking is enough to make people laugh.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Kai-shek Appeals to the British People to Aid Our Wounded Soldiers and Civilians</h3>

All members of the British public who are willing to provide medicine and Red Cross relief work will be gratefully received, because millions of seriously wounded soldiers will not be able to recover without adequate medicine for treatment." The embassy has issued an appeal to the British public. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<h3>Short Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>After Japan's policy of a swift victory failed, it was at its wit's end. It then used a large number of planes to bomb Nanjing, Guangzhou, and other prosperous cities and important transportation areas, massacring innocent civilians. The cruelty of this action and the failure of its national policy are already clear evidence.</p>
<p>However, human justice and morality have not been lost in the world, causing public outrage throughout humanity. Therefore, the foreign press has referred to the Japanese planes' massacre of our innocent civilians as demons in the forest, enemies of humanity, evidence of madness in Japanese policy, or a permanent stain on the standing of Japan among the civilized nations of the world. Those in third countries who have witnessed this kind of atrocity deeply abhor it to such an extent. What deeper and more meaningful terms do we, who have personally suffered the benevolence of the brutal Japanese, have to express the crimes of the brutal Japanese and the emotions of hatred in our hearts? We can only forever remember this kind of atrocity with the four characters "engraved in our bones" and wait for the day of revenge.</p>
<p>However, although the countries express sympathy for our country, they mostly adopt a wait-and-see attitude and dare not provide the most effective assistance. There is still a kind of barrier between them. If Japan inflicts this on our country today, how can we be sure that it will not turn around and affect them in the future? Therefore, to avoid future disasters for one's own country and to maintain lasting world peace, one must first uphold world justice and humanity.</p>

<h3>News of the Battle North of Yaoguantun on the Jinpu Railway</h3>
<p>From the 12th to the 20th, fierce battles repeatedly occurred, with us holding the advantage.</p>
<p>Jinan dispatch: Our army on the Jinpu Railway, due to the destruction of the Machang-Qingxian area by enemy aircraft, has changed its strategy. The railway forces have adopted a defensive posture, while advancing from both flanks. Our army's front line is located south of Xingji and north of Yaoguantun, with strong forces. On the 12th, the enemy army began firing at the Qingxian station. Around 5:00 AM, the enemy fired sixty to seventy rounds from Qingxian towards our position. Our army immediately counterattacked from the north of Yaoguantun. This lasted for about half an hour before ceasing. Around 8:00 AM, the Xingji station's northern siding was destroyed. Around 9:00 AM, the southern siding of the Xingji station was also destroyed. The Xingji military station's staff and workers all came south on armored trains. At 10:00 AM, an enemy aircraft arrived at Xingji station for a low-altitude strafing run. Our armored train moved to the south of Xingji station to defend the position. Subsequently, four sections of the railway north of Yaoguantun were also destroyed. Our forward forces, newly reinforced, deployed new defensive positions three miles north of Yaoguantun for defense. Around 2:00 PM, fighting was intense on both sides of Xingji station. The enemy repeatedly attacked, but all attempts failed. That evening, our left flank forces detoured north, heading northwest of Xingji, and advanced towards Machang north of Qingxian. At the same time, two or three armored train units guarded the area north of Yaoguantun station outside Yangqi. Our newly reinforced frontline forces were also in the Yaoguantun area. Although a portion of the 29th Army was transferred to the rear for rest, the majority remained at the front participating in the fighting.</p>
<p>On the 13th, our army launched a counterattack, engaging the enemy in a fierce battle north of Yaoguantun. It continued through the night without stopping. At dawn on the 14th, the Japanese army began to retreat north. Around 5:00 AM, our army advanced north from Yaoguantun, making intermittent contact with the enemy. They then reached a point about seventeen or eighteen miles north of Yaoguantun station. By around 6:00 AM, intense fighting broke out near Yaoguantun, with very heavy artillery fire. A unit of our newly reinforced forces was deployed south of Yaoguantun station, while our armored train engaged the enemy between Yaoguantun and Xingji. A unit of enemy forces was discovered four or five miles south of Xingji station, carrying heavy artillery and armored vehicles. They were often severely attacked head-on by our armored trains, causing them to retreat. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. The fighting temporarily ceased.</p>
<p>On the night of the 14th, our army ordered a general offensive, advancing north and engaging the enemy in extremely fierce fighting north of Yaoguantun station. The sound of gunfire continued all night. At the same time, there was also intense fighting on both flanks. Our lines remained unmoved until noon on the 15th, when it temporarily stopped. The front was temporarily quiet, but there was still intense fighting northwest of Yaoguantun on our left flank. At the same time, our reinforcements had crossed Banbianlou and were advancing north, actively moving towards their destination. At 1:00 PM, a certain brigade of our frontline security team advanced to a point three miles south of Xingji station. At 4:25 PM, approximately a thousand enemy soldiers on the front, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, launched a fierce attack on our position, while simultaneously shelling the Yuqingtun and Meiguantun areas on both sides, firing a total of seventy to eighty rounds. Our newly reinforced forces and security team bravely responded, delivering a head-on attack. The fighting near Xingji station was quite intense. Over thirty shells landed south of Xingji station and north of Yaoguantun, creating a temporary cloud of smoke and a deafening sound of artillery fire. One enemy aircraft flew over to bomb our position, but our army was exceptionally brave, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. By around 7:00 PM, the enemy was unable to sustain the attack and retreated north. Our army pursued them bravely, and thus recovered Xingji station. Our main forces immediately garrisoned the station and established solid defenses. However, there were still over three hundred enemy soldiers within the streets of Xingji, and thirty to forty remaining enemy soldiers in nearby Yuqingtun. They have been surrounded by our army and are being eliminated separately. On this day, our army captured over ten enemy soldiers in a certain area on the right flank. Most of them were Koreans. According to their statements, they were extremely afraid of the bravery of our army.</p>
<p>From the night of the 16th until the morning of the 17th, the front was quiet. We were north of Yaoguantun, and the enemy was in the Xingji area. The two sides remained in a stalemate with no changes. At 4:00 AM on the 17th, over four hundred soldiers of a certain brigade of our security team returned to a certain location in the rear for rest. A certain unit of our newly reinforced forces dispatched plainclothes teams to the front for reconnaissance, and actively prepared defensive fortifications. At 6:40 AM, it was reported that our army had dug trenches at the siding north of Yaoguantun station, making the position more solid. There was no sound of artillery fire on the front and flanks, and the situation was temporarily quiet. The section of railway north of Yaoguantun station that had been dismantled on the 16th was being repaired on the 17th to facilitate our army's advance. From morning until noon, there was no fighting on the front. Around 1:00 PM, the sound of gunfire north of Yaoguantun was very intense. According to two wounded soldiers from a certain unit of ours who arrived at Yaoguantun, several enemy armored vehicles and about four hundred enemy soldiers were discovered on both sides of the Yunhe River south of Xingji station, advancing towards our position. They were repelled by our army five or six miles from Yaoguantun station, suffering heavy casualties. At 3:25 PM, a unit of our army was guarding Li Xin Zhuang, to the left of the Yaoguantun military station. A unit of enemy soldiers and armored vehicles used flat-trajectory guns to fire on our position. Our army immediately responded with a head-on attack. After about an hour of intense fighting, the stubborn enemy was finally repelled. The platoon leader of our army's company was wounded, and the special affairs officer died in battle. At 3:40 PM, two or three enemy armored vehicles were located at Gaoguantun, northwest of Yaoguantun. At both ends of Xingji station, there were a small number of enemy plainclothes soldiers, and a column of armored trains was parked, about six kilometers away from our defensive position. The enemy did not attack south, so no conflict occurred.</p>
<p>On the 18th, our troops were rotated, and the frontline fighting started again. At 6:30 AM, the sound of gunfire north of Yaoguantun station was very intense. The enemy fired artillery from Gaoguantun towards our position. Enemy artillery shells also came from Wangxinzhuang, west of the station. Many shells landed around the station, but our side suffered no losses. Around 7:00 AM, the enemy artillery fired over ten more shells at our position north of Yaoguantun station, landing in the position, but our side also suffered no losses. A unit of our newly reinforced forces strictly guarded the position in the area north of Yaoguantun station. The enemy was then repelled by our attack, and the front line was temporarily silent. At 11:00 AM, the enemy from Gaoguantun south of Xingji, again under the cover of aircraft, used artillery to launch a fierce attack on the positions to the left and right of Yaoguantun station. By evening, several hundred artillery shells had been fired. Our armored trains bravely fought back on the front of Yaoguantun, engaging in extremely fierce fighting with the enemy. At the same time, the enemy also used six tanks to attack the Renhezhuang position three miles west (slightly north) of Yaoguantun station. A unit of our army fought bravely until 5:50 PM, and finally repelled the enemy forces. In the evening, our army took advantage of the victory to launch a counterattack on Lilou, four or five miles northwest of Yaoguantun, engaging in fierce fighting with the enemy. They surrounded and eliminated over eighty remaining enemy soldiers in the area. However, the remaining enemy in the area used civilian houses as shields and dug open the canal, causing the ground to be several feet deep in water, making combat difficult. Our army had no choice but to retreat back to the original Renhezhuang position on the 19th, and separately advance north through other routes. A regiment engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy northwest of Yao Gongtun, capturing many villages. However, due to the lack of defensive fortifications, they retreated back to the original position. A certain battalion of that regiment engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, suffering heavy casualties. The enemy suffered even heavier casualties. Another regiment of ours retreated to the Niangniang River area near Xingji on the evening of the 19th (two or three miles from the station).</p>
<p>At about 10:00 AM on the 20th, our army launched another general offensive to the north. Armored trains led the way at Yaoguantun station, firing artillery at the enemy's positions to cover our army's advance. Our Renhezhuang troops bravely attacked northwest, engaging in fierce fighting with the enemy. By 3:00 PM, our dare-to-die corps attacked the Li Xin Zhuang and Chenjia Yuan areas northwest of Yaoguantun station, killing over five hundred enemy soldiers. Corpses were strewn across the fields, and bayonets were stained red. The two villages were captured, and the remaining enemy retreated towards Gaoguantun. Because the two villages were only two or three hundred meters in front of our position, and the residents in the villages had already fled, the two villages were immediately burned to remove obstacles and implement a scorched earth policy. On our army's right flank, there was no fighting in the Doucun area.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Red Cross Society</h3>
<p>Songjiang dispatch: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Songjiang, being close to Shanghai, has seen a continuous stream of people fleeing to the area. In addition, enemy aircraft have repeatedly bombed the train station, causing numerous deaths and injuries. The Songjiang branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, taking responsibility, under the leadership of President Zhu Jiu Ji, Director Zhou Xuewen, and others, has been supervising the relief efforts. They have established shelters that have accommodated over twenty thousand people. However, due to the local gentry and wealthy people having fled the area first, they are facing extreme financial difficulties. Recently, Zhu Gongliang dared to impersonate the president of the branch and receive a large sum of money from the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association. He is heartless and extremely detestable. The branch has submitted a request for a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Citizens from Various Districts Jointly Request Landlords to Donate One Month's Rent to Purchase Public Bonds</h3>
<p>The method of depositing savings to purchase public bonds is implemented, and it is especially hoped that the government will comply with the people's request.</p>
<p>The Citizens' United Association of the First Special District of this city and the sub-associations of the 2nd, 4th, 11th, 14th, 15th, 18th, 20th, 21st, 24th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 33rd, 34th, 36th, 38th, 41st, 42nd, and 44th districts, in order to broadly encourage the subscription of national salvation public bonds, have jointly issued a declaration, the main points of which are: (1) The four fundraising methods formulated by the First Special District Group of the Citizens' Fundraising Corps are all considered by our associations to be very important, especially the first method, which states: "Using the amount of one month's rent of citizens in this district as the standard, the tenant will purchase public bonds when paying rent, either in one lump sum or in installments, until the full amount is paid. For the tenants, the fundraising will be carried out according to the circumstances. If it is a self-owned house, the amount of the donation will be used to calculate the purchase." It should be implemented immediately. Since the government issued national salvation public bonds, even peddlers and coolies have risen up to purchase them, fulfilling their national duty. Landlords own property, and although they also encounter difficulties, their economic capacity is always superior. They should not be stingy with one month's rent and shirk the responsibility of a citizen. (2) The suggestion from all sectors to deposit savings in banks and money shops to purchase public bonds is unanimously supported by the whole country. It is earnestly hoped that the government will comply with the people's request and order its implementation immediately. This will surely raise a large sum of money and achieve success.</p>

It is now known that the British Church authorities have replied to Shanghai, expressing unlimited sympathy for China's suffering, and will remit funds to China in the coming days. As for the American Church, the relief donation has been remitted to the national currency of 10,000 yuan some time ago, which will be transferred by the association to the church relief agencies in this city for proper distribution, so that the general refugees can receive practical benefits.

<h3>Various Organizations Ask Authorities to Crack Down on Rising Coal Prices</h3>
<p>Exploitation for Profit is Extremely Heinous</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs recently issued a notice stipulating a unified price for coal briquettes, which should be sold for $1.60 in national currency per dan, and prohibiting manipulation and monopoly, deliberately raising the selling price, so as not to affect the daily needs of the people. However, the various coal briquette manufacturers have been disobeying in public but complying in private, and the selling prices are extremely inconsistent. The retail price is set at two yuan per dan, or two yuan several cents, while others advertise at $1.50 or $1.60, but the weight is insufficient, with each dan only weighing about 60 kilograms. Their violation of the law and exploitation of citizens is extremely heinous. It is reported that various organizations have reported the facts to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, requesting a crackdown and severe punishment.</p>
<h3>German Shipping Company Denies Selling Arms to Japan</h3>
<p>Regarding the report in a certain newspaper the other day that the North German Lloyd ship "Gneisenau" transported a large batch of arms to Shanghai in late last month, which were transshipped to Gentlemen and sold to Japan, the local representative of the North German Lloyd Company, Melchers &amp; Co., specially and solemnly denies this and clarifies the following three points: (1) The "Gneisenau" did not carry any arms, and the policy of the North German Lloyd Company has always been not to transport such goods on passenger ships. (2) The "Gneisenau" did not enter the Shanghai wharf at all, so how could there be a problem of interception midway? The ship sailed from the mouth of the Yangtze River to Yokohama on August 14th because the war in Shanghai broke out and to protect the safety of the ship's passengers and cargo. It was by no means subject to any external interference. (3) The Shanghai cargo was all unloaded in Hong Kong, while the Japanese cargo was unloaded in Yokohama and Kobe. There was absolutely no situation where Shanghai cargo was transshipped to Japan for unloading. (National Sea Report)</p>
<h3>Fresh Pork Industry Establishes Wartime Joint Operations Office</h3>
