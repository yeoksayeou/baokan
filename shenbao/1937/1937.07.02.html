<h3>澈查投機事件</h3>

<p>正文:</p>
<p>滬紗布交易所投機操縱風潮發生以來。瞬已二旬。經財實兩部認眞澈查之結果。對於交易所經紀人及理事之行政處分。已於二十八日發表。昨據新聞所傳。蔣院長又電令將稅務署長吳啟鼎。江蘇統稅局長盛昇頤暫行免職扣押。分別查詢。究竟吳盛二君。對此次投機風潮是否有關。吾人目前固尚難妄斷。設若果有其事。則今日之查辦。在吳盛君。自屬咎有應得。在我國之吏治上言。亦為一種進步之表徵。從來中國“官官相護”之積習。當可因此而開掃除之端所謂“清明廉潔”之政治。亦將由此而得出發點。民國二十餘年來人民所渴望之澄清吏治。至今已有事實之表現矣。</p>
<p>由來中國官場最大之缺點。乃在不能破除“情面。”咸視官場為“官海。”以為升沉無定。何必責備過嚴。於是同僚之間。明知其有故。而不願指摘。明知其有罪。而不願揭發。因循蹉跎。吏治日壞。一般潔身自好之流。皆抱“和尚撞鐘”之心。而一般因緣為利之徒。遂利用其權勢與機會。為非凟職今日公務員之投機操縱卽為此中之一例。</p>
<p>顧一國經濟之發展。自有一定之軌道。在軌道之中途。萬不能任何障害之存在。若投機之操縱。卽足以妨碍軌道上之運行。以連日之紗花市場而論。暴瀉已達四十餘元。嚮使無往日四五十元之上漲。决無此今日四五十元之暴落。此四五十元之暴漲慘落中。其所及於社會安寗秩序之影響。當為不鮮。小而至於商人之身家財產。大而至於整個經濟發展。莫不受一深重之打擊。此種不良之投機操縱。卽出之於一私人。國家亦應予以適當之制裁况今據道路所傳。出之於公務員乎。是以今日蔣院長之措置。不特對歷來官場上之缺點。將予以正確之校正。卽整個中國經濟之發展。當亦可因此而慚入於正軌。但在此行政處分以外。吾人猶望更能有司法之處分。以大公無私之精神。為持平不曲之判斷。</p>

<h3>黑龍江日俄衝突　事態不致擴大</h3>
<p>日本四相會議决議　視本案為地方事件</p>
<p>［東京］關於日蘇砲艦在黑龍江甘雀資島附近衢突事、日外務省宣稱、希望蘇聯政府迅速撤退集中於該處之軍隊與砲艦、以免使局勢更為嚴重、蘇聯政府態度仍不明、據一般觀察、甘雀資興齊南霍兩島本身不致變為嚴重之問題、因該兩島每年有九個月均被水淹、再則其面積甚小、幾無軍事上與經濟上之價值、目前所爭論者、為島嶼附近水道之航行也、根據日蘇水道協定、分界綫係位於黑龍江水面之中、其北屬於蘇聯、其南則屬於日“滿”、現時該島嶼南之河流甚狹隘、僅北部宜於航行、因此糾紛發生、目前問題之重心、緊於雙方是否遵守日駐俄大使重光葵與蘇聯外交人民委員李維諾夫會談時所商定之條件、而按規定彼此均撤退軍隊與戰艦、從一般局勢觀察、兩國似不擬對此島嶼與航綫擴大爭辯、而致發生嚴重之破裂也、（一日中央社電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］蘇俄大使館今日宣布、蘇俄政府已向日方建議、兩國軍隊皆自黑龍江中兩島之附近撤退、並重新建議雙方組織委員會、勘定疆界云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<h3>日俄進行外交折衝</h3>
<p>［莫斯科］日駐俄大使重光葵接到外務省訓令、卽於一日午前零時至外交人民委員會晤史托摩尼亞可夫次長、對於甘雀資事件提嚴重抗議、史次長亦表明蘇聯政府之見解、會談前後達三小時始辭出、復於當日午後趨訪外交人民委員長李維諾夫、對於黑龍江岸之撤兵問題再度恊議、（一日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］外務省昨晚發表談話、謂政府因不能諒解蘇聯態度、業已訓令重光大使對蘇聯政府提出嚴重抗議、（一日同盟電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］日本駐蘇大使重光與蘇俄外長李維諾夫交涉二日之後、聲稱、爭議中之黑龍江二島上、蘇俄軍隊如不撤退、日本卽將“採取應付辦法、”重光氏並稱、蘇俄已在黑龍江中召中小砲艦三十艘、岸上亦有大軍雲集、而偽“滿”方面僅四五師團、現在關於昨日蘇俄砲艦被沉之報告、並無新消息、重光大使向報界稱、彼深信蘇俄必能撤退軍隊、並否認已向蘇俄提出最後警告、聲明如不撤退卽將宣戰之說、重光氏謂日本僅承認一八六○年中俄條約中所載明之蘇“滿”界綫、不能承認俄方提出之該約秘本有紅綫標明兩島應屬俄境云、（一日國民電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］蘇聯政府昨日傍晚要求重光大使談判甘雀資島問題、重光卽於下午七時半派宮川一等書記官赴蘇聯外部、會見新任駐日大使柯資洛夫斯基、柯氏關於本事件、指摘日“滿”兩軍轟擊蘇聯軍艦、以致乘員之中發生多數死亡或受傷者之事、對日提出抗議宮川對此說明蘇聯軍艦越境入滿領、並為非法掃射之事實加以反駁、並提出抗議、兩人會談達一小時未得要領、今後似由兩國外交機關繼續談判此問題、（三十日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日本四相協議善後</h3>
<p>［東京］日首相近衛•外相新田•陸相杉山•海相米內、今晨十一時舉行四相會議、討論關於甘雀資事件之善後方策、外相廣田報告日駐俄大使重光葵於今晨一時起與蘇聯副外委斯托莫涅科夫作三小時談話之情形、據聞會議决定探取不擴大緊張局面之政策、倘蘇聯立卽撤退武裝軍隊、日本亦準備開始善後之談判、而以恢復原狀為前提云、（一日中央社電）</p>
<p>［東京］日陸軍中央部關於黑龍江甘雀資島事件、已有接到公式報告、而其關於此事件之見解如下、重光大使與李維諾夫外相會見之結果、確定蘇聯撤退其集結之軍隊、然此談判完舉直後蘇聯軍艦竟於白畫公然越境、對於日“滿”軍實施非法掃射之事實、足以證明蘇聯當局為如何無責任、且蔑視國際信義之存在、日“滿”兩軍對此出於自衛行動、係獨立國家當然之義務、諸方面將來發生何種事態、緊於蘇聯行為之如何、而其責任在於蘇聯、固不待言、解决本問題之第一步驟、在於蘇聯依照重光李維諾夫談判之結果、早時撤退其軍隊、（一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯當局保守沉默</h3>
<p>［莫斯科］外傳蘇聯砲艦一艘、在黑龍江上遭日本及偽滿軍隊開砲擊沉一事、此間日本大使館現仍表示毫不知情、但日本方面以為蘇聯砲艦三艘入“滿洲國”所屬水面、係屬“桃釁行動、”該國駐俄大使重光葵將於最近時期內向蘇聯提出抗議、則已證明屬實、此在蘇聯當局方面、對於砲艦擊沉一事此際並未發表意見云、（中央社三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>雙方所傳衝突情形</h3>
<p>［莫斯科］布拉戈維先斯克報告、六月二十九日偽砲艦一艘開至黑龍江兩策夫斯基島（申奴卡島）附近、向蘇聯哨兵開火、蘇方還擊後、日偽軍卽由滿岸開砲轟擊在蘇聯江岸游弋之蘇砲艦一艘、結果該艦損壞、船員死二人、傷三人、日偽砲艦則為蘇聯哨艦所擒、帶至蘇岸、（一日塔斯電）據昨夜關東軍發生佈告稱、事先有俄砲艦三艘侵塞奴法（譯晋）島南之黑龍江、向日“滿”駐軍射擊、日“滿”軍乃不得不發砲同擊、結果擊沉其一艘、其餘二艘一受重創、一被迫離去，由表面觀之、日“滿”軍隊方面似未受有損失、事後“滿州”立即向蘇俄政府提出抗議、長春方面認為事態嚴重、並稱、“滿”政府决定採取强有力而公充之態度、以保邊境河流航行之自由無阻云、（中央社一日路透電）</p>
<h3>英德注視遠東局勢</h3>
<p>［倫敦］各報登載消息、謂蘇聯砲艦一艘在黑龍江上遭日本軍隊開砲擊沉、日蘇關係因而驟趨緊張、關於此項事變、負責方面尚未接得正式報告、故不願發表任何意見、但據消息靈通人士所知、日俄兩國關係緊張若果達到危險之程度、則英政府將向雙方籲請務各採取溫和態度、尤其對於日本、由英國提出勸告更為相宜、蓋英日兩國談判不日將在倫敦開始舉行也、（中央社三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］柏林今日各報、均以大字標題、刋載俄日衝突消息、對於蘇俄砲艦轟擊日“偽”邊境部隊、及黑龍江羣島發生事件、均有詳細消息、但各報尚未發表評論、德國對此項事件之演變、甚為注意、（一日國民海通電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］關於日“滿”軍艦在黑龍江上擊沉蘇俄砲艦事、此間僅有社會黨人民報與急社黨新時代報發表意見、并皆嚴詞加以批評、人民報載稱、“日本軍人每次遇有機會、卽在蘇俄與“滿洲國”交界處所、引起事端、所幸莫斯科方面仍不願與日本發生衝突、遠東和平局勢不致因而破壞、特日本若欲利用歐洲現行局勢以便私圖、則當別論矣、新時代報載稱、“日俄兩國關係緊張原因、可於日本軍人思想中求之、蘇俄方面仍能鎮靜自持、并以保守防衛的立場為事、此層極應加以注意”云、（中央社一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>東報評論中日問題</h3>
<p>主張對華外交　放棄寬和政策</p>
<p>［東京］中外商業新聞今日社評、題為“調整中日關係之眞正使命、”該報首責中國對調整關係持極冷淡之態度、繼謂中國之抱此種態度、當歸答於日本之决定對華保持現狀、致使中國認日本轉趨消極、而彼之態度、遂更為强硬、該報繼發表意見謂、“日本為應付現局計、應遂行前所採取相同之政策方法雖可改變、惟基本政策之全部、則無改變之必要、中國堅持先解决政治問題、其意願在消除華北之特殊性、此僅為中國根據結果而非原因之武斷的結論、吾人雖亦希望首先解决政治問題、惟當談及政治問題時、“滿洲”問題應先提出、華北之特殊性、乃來自“滿洲”問題、如“滿洲”問題一個不解决、則華北問題卽無解决之可能”、該報結論謂、“鑒於目前之中日關係、必須放棄種種寬和政策而向解决基本問題之途前進”云、綜觀上述社評、吾人對於中日前途當可預測共大半也、（一日中央社電）</p>

<p>法郎金成色另行規定　現聽任幣價自由漲落　法蘭西銀行貸款政府</p>
<p>［巴黎］政府所提出之財政整理法案、自經參衆兩議院通過後、內閣於本日午後舉行國務會議、通過命令一則、其內容如下、㊀一九三六年十月一日所頒佈之貨幣法、規定法郎金成色之最高與最低之限度者、（按法郎原含純金○•○六五五公分、去年貨幣法規定金成色、最高限度為○•○四九公分、最低為○•○四三公分）茲予以廢止、㊁法郎法定金成色與紙幣兌換現金之條件、日後另行發表命令規定之、㊂在法郎法定金成色制定之前法郎與各國貨幣之此價、應由匯兌平準基金調節之、㊃一九三七年六月二十八日政府命令規定商業票據、應用現金或外國貨幣償付者、得展期償還、此項命令茲撤消之、此外、法蘭西銀行與政府間新訂合同、規定該銀行得以一五、○○○、○○○、○○○法郎之款項貸予政府、至證券交易所規定於明日復業、各地物品交易所則暫時仍實停市、（中央社三十日哈瓦斯電)</p>
<p>［巴黎］黃金購價現已規定每公斤為二八九五九法郎、等於英金一鎊合一二八•七五法郎之匯價、(中央社一日路透電)</p>
<p>［巴黎］負責人士頃就國會所採取之金融措置、加以評論、以為普恩查故總理、曾以一九二六年至一九二八年間為穩定法郎之試騐期間、直至一九二八年六月、始行確實穩定法郎、今茲政府亦當仿效此法、而在長時期內、聽任法郎自由漲落、一俟法郎事實上恢復穩定狀况之後、始乃發表命令、制定其法定比價、今後法郎漲落、範園較為廣大、投機行為、自可藉此加以制止、此外、匯兌平準基金一○、○○○、○○○、○○○法郎、幾已告罄、亟當予以補足、俾得調節匯市、而法蘭西銀行、亦當賡續依照世界市價、購買黃金云、（中央社三十日哈瓦斯電)</p>
<h3>法郎恢復交易</h3>
<p>倫敦巴黎市價均跌落　一鎊約合百廿三法郎</p>
<p>［倫敦］外匯市塲今晨恢復營業後、經紀人頻接詢問法郎價格之電話、但多數未曾成交、最初缺方補空、故價格尚穩、盤旋於一百二十三法郎合英金一鎊左右、但未幾買風頓息、投機家爭先資出、愈接愈屬、其故以官場未當有援助法郎之舉動也、價乃迅速下趨、降至一百二十九、後時有起落、然總在一二九與一二七之間、查星期一日收盤價格為一一○•五三、消息靈通方面對於法郎前途、不願加以批評、良以法財長廳萊整頓貨幣之程序、在原則上固屬良好、但結果如何、則緊於此原則之運用也、（中央社一日路透電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］財政整理法案成立之後、此間交易所已於本日復業、法郎英匯開盤時、合一百二十三法郎又二十五生丁、美匯合二十四法郎又九十生丁、旋於午後一時半、跌至一百二十九法郎又二十六生丁、收盤時英匯回漲至一百二十八法郎又九十三生丁、美匯則跌至二十六法郎又六生丁、此項匯價以與六月二十八日收盤時相較、約跌百分之十二、此外、證券交易所各項證券均見上漲、平均約百分之十、尤以外國證券為甚、（中央社一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］交易所復業之後、午後一時半英鎊匯價為一百二十六法郎、美元匯價為二十六法郎、（中央社一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［紐約］此間外匯市場中人現認法郎價格之低落、乃法兩退出三國貨幣協定已成事實之表微、不過法國尚未有正式宣佈耳、今日法郎現貨之第一次成交價格、為美金四元、合一百法郎、成交數填甚微、純為商業用途、後缺方稍有補空者、有數家銀行掛牌、每百法郎合美金四元一角三分、至四元一角五分不等、（中央社三十日唔瓦期電）</p>
<h3>參院討論情形</h3>
<p>［巴黎］政府所提出之財政整理法案、頃已由參觀院以一六七票對八二票表决通過、參議院於午後三時十五分開會之後、首由財政委員會主席加德發表宣言、略稱、財政委員會對於預算恢復平衡、原欲說其成功、然前勃魯姆內閣提出財政全權法案、當時財政委員會、因恐其實施國有政策爰乃予以拒絕、加德旋又稱頌財政部長龐萊、謂渠對於財政狀况、提出誠信之報告、不稍譯飾、有足多者、此外、龐萊又曾致函財政委員會、允諸對於匯兌决不實施管理、因此種種、務望參議院題過政府法案、而以廣泛權力、丹予政府云、至是財政部長廳萊繼起發言、當將昨日渠在衆議院對於財政狀况所提出之數字、重述一過、並說明經濟與財政復興事業、務當同時進行云、最後、旭丹總理親自登壇發表宣言、稱財政狀况、若不急　還清、則社會進步事參即難　其收效、現內閣對於前勃魯姆內閣之政策、不擬反某道而行之、所欲者則在調和參衆兩院之意見、以使歸於一致而已云、（中央社三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］法預算委員會報告員加德今日發表演說、衆認為係對於前勃魯婦內閣所致之訂詞、彼稱參議院所以不願以財政特權授與勃魯姆內閣、而復將特權授之於新政府者、因恐勃魯姆內開將藉此特權行其迫脅與國有之政策、而不僅在國家之復與云、加德復謂有謂參議無道於取締投機者、實係對於、參院之一種誹榜、但參院曾要求預算之平衡、惟覺勃魯姆政府為國庫兩借債、已到藉掘俱空之時云、以上言詞、祉會黨聞之極為忿忿、而前財長奧利沃爾聞加德氏之演說、應加張貼、竟離座昂然而出、但加德民之演說、事後並未張貼、蓋恐因此而傷兩院聞之感情也、（中央社三十日路透電）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>為誰而死？</h3>
<p>— 乃一</p>
<p>靑年戴敦榮投浦自殺了，他的衣袋裏遺有男女照片各一，男的是他自己，女的是他妻子，在女的照片後面。留着五個字曰“為你而死的。”這新聞已見前日各報。昨日各報內，又有關於他的續聞，那是說明他自殺的原因。原來他們夫婦倆的情愛原是“彌篤，”“惟其岳母與戴意見相左，去歲宜珍（戴妻名）歸寗，卽一去不返，乃母曾迭次囑婿另行婚娶，”以後，據說婿岳倆還時常爭論，就在最後一次爭論以後，戴敦榮覺得“做人無聊，”於是便投浦自殺了。</p>
<p>對於自殺，我始終總覺得是於人於已兩無裨益的傻事，個性堅强一點的，也卽是說，理智强一點的人，對於這樣的傻事，總不大會幹出來：然而感情豐富，原非罪惡，並且也可說是一件美德，而感情豐富者幹出這樣傻事來者，背後有環境迫之使然，那更不容我們漠視，我們對於感情豐富的弱者固然有權利和義務呌他們應該堅强一點的活下去，但若放過背後的魔手，則非但不公，也且妝無補於事！</p>
<p>戴敦榮的自殺，其中是否另有隱情？與岳母意見，又何以相左？我們無從知道。但是以“一去不返”及“囑婿另行婚娶看來，則這裏面有封建的魔鬼在作祟，是昭然若揭的。戀愛是二個人的事，第三者是無權過問與干涉的，何况本來已是夫妻，更何况是“情愛彌篤”的夫妻：然而在封建的父母，則不但未婚嫁的兒女是一筆財產，就是在嫁了以後，雖可以用“嫁出了的女兒撥出了的水”來推卸責任，而如有好處，則依舊會用“身從何來”來作為“私產”的理由，於是乎，祗要與女婿的意見相左，留着女兒不返，也就成為當然之理了。而從封建環境中長大的女兒，就卽使是到了“出家從夫”的階段了，並且是夫妻“情愛彌篤”</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>，“歸寗”以後，因爲習於服從，却還是以父母之意志爲意志的。</p>
<p>跟戴敦榮同樣，而險乎也死於封建惡魔之手的，則還有嚮導員李劍華的服毒，李劍華服毒的原因，是因爲早年訂婚的未婚夫因她做了嚮導員，覺得“有辱門楣，”所以“提出退婚，意圖另娶，”而在李聞之，便也以爲“奇恥大辱，”於是“怨恨交加，無顔見人，”便出此服毒的下策！</p>
<p>做了嚮導員是否“有辱門楣，”這是應該以該嚮導員是否出賣肉體等來定的，然而又“孰令致之”呢？是該嚮導員自己甘願墮落嗎？</p>
<p>是的，在現在，女嚮導員是一種畸形的“女子職業，”在一般人的心目中，這是一般不純正的女人所幹的事情；然而又何以會成爲不純正，又何以會如此發達呢？</p>
<p>再以李劍華的遭遇説，如果不早年訂婚，她這一次“奇恥大辱”應該是不會有的，然而在早婚制度下，她却“早年已許字與某姓”了。</p>
<p>而解除婚約，又是否是“奇恥大辱”呢？是的，因爲被認爲“有辱門楣”而“提出退婚，”的確是件“奇恥大辱，”然而在封建中長大的女性，則恐怕所認爲“奇恥大辱，”倒不是被認爲“有辱門楣，”而是由認爲“有辱門楣”所引起的“退婚！”在封建中訓育長大的女性，作爲唯一的反抗的武器，又祇有死路一條。例如以演過“新女性”的阮玲玉，她所作爲反抗的武器的，也祇是用了一個“死”字。</p>
<p>赤子無罪，罪在社會，然而對這罪惡的社會，我們又用什麽來反抗呢？</p>
<p>願以此以詢不願死的人們！</p>

<p>—憶北平</p>
<p>夜間，我穿過壯嚴的朝門，從黑暗裏踱到前門的人街，一條巷子的燈光，誘引似的霎閃，在晃亮的發光裏，展開了夜市。</p>
<p>我走到一條熱鬧的胡同，在洋車夫往來的吆喝聲裏，跨進一幢呌做樓的地方，從暗澹的扶階上，灣到二層樓一間樓房裏，燈光異常的亮，四周掛了好多的紅幛，上面有着許多歌頌的句子。</p>
<p>在一排排位子上，可找出好幾個有了鬍鬍的老年紀人，他們不再裝出道學的樣子，面上同樣充滿了年靑人的熱情，渴望，和貪婪的眼光。</p>
<p>一個打扮得美麗的姑娘，踱到臺前，臺下的好多聽客緊張起來，當鼓姬婉轉地說了幾句應酬的話，洶湧起許多讚稱的聲音，鼓姬含着笑，閃着明媚的秋波，手敲着鼓，小小的櫻唇裏，吐出了許多歌詠古英雄的史躇，一部的聽衆，被美好的姿態風魔了。</p>
<p>“老是天天來的人，他們倆個都有用意，”友人貼近我耳朵旁說，手指點着一做個人，連有鬍了的老人也在裏面</p>
<p>在我眼前，似乎展開一幅臘獸的圖畫，他們一個個貪婪地找着了可爱的小獸，用繭絲樣的手段，把錢點着戲，去換他們的媚笑，過後就向他們家裏走動，不久的時光，就可以獵着了俘虜。</p>
<p>一個姑娘低下頭進去，又換上一個鼓姬，她們一個個都穿看艷麗的衣裳，面上塗了粉，面類搽着紅的胭脂，纖細的手指上，戴了閃礫的指環，指甲上染了玫瑰色的油。</p>
<p>“她們沒有好的命運，——友人唏噓地說“她們的生涯是悲慘的，現在就像羔羊般，聽受着人家零碎的宰割，過後，那就被該是什麼大爺，摟去當不知算做第幾房的妾，這還算是美滿的結局哩，假使面姿衰老的一天來臨，那就一切也都完了！”</p>
<p>臺上一個歌孃，正在婉轉地唱着個生悲怨的姑娘，在葬着被推殘飄落的殘花的一段呢，我看着她我彷彿看不見使人風魔的臉，窈窕的身段，我祇看到她的可怕的陰影，她也許就像那凄凉殘花的命運。</p>
<p>我似乎什麼也聽不見，那人間的悲劇，老是瞭澆在心頭，我默默地思索着</p>
<p>深夜，當最後的姑娘，唱完了她的鼓詞，許多人擁着散出來。</p>
<p>天上沒有月亮，沒有星星，那胡同裏蔞弱的燈光，照在地上，投出許多錯綜的影子來。</p>
<h3>從青年選擇讀物説起</h3>
<p>— 亞廬</p>
<p>隨着時代的需要，青年的知識食糧，實在是非常廹切。在目前的出版界中刋行的讀物，雖“浩如烟海”，可是想找幾本有益於青年的讀物，簡直不易多覯。我們如果到四馬路上的雜誌經售處去留心翻閲，覺得軟性的讀物實有凌駕硬性讀物之勢。這種戕害青年心性，麻醉青年思想的刋物，竟特别的多，不能不説是當前出版界的畸形現象！</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>我們應得明瞭，書本不但能夠解答我們各種難解决的問題，而且更能逐漸增强我們的牛命力。所以靑年對於選擇讀物，必須要用嚴格的眼光，去找有益的，切合實際的，以及與個性相合的書籍來閱讀。我們並不反對閱讀或學習幽默的文章，鬆散的小品，實在處在這國步維艱的時代，各種學術科學，都極需要切合實際的應用，不能再拿我們靑年寶貴的光陰，去消耗在害多益少的讀物，這是我們負有時代使命的靑年應當加以深切的判別的。</p>
<p>最後，我們為靑年的利害着想，至誠地希望國內知名的著作家，屏棄那些空洞無謂的作品，多發表些對於靑年敦礪學，尤其是激發愛國愛民的思想的作品來，共同負起抗敵救亡的偉大使命！</p>

Although Sino-Japanese diplomatic matters were mentioned informally, the timing for an exchange of opinions has not yet arrived. Kawagoe expressed that Prime Minister Konoe, Foreign Minister Hirota, and the Japanese government and public all hope that Xu will return to his post soon.

(1st - Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Diplomatic sources indicate that the issues recently raised by the Japanese side regarding Sino-Japanese diplomacy represent unilateral hopes, and in reality, the gap is quite large. The Japanese side is currently conducting what it calls "internal coordination," and Sino-Japanese negotiations have not yet reached the stage of active discussions. Therefore, there are currently no preparations underway for formal Sino-Japanese diplomatic talks. Ambassador Kawagoe is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Nanjing on the 3rd, stay briefly, and then return to Shanghai before proceeding to Tianjin and Beijing to meet with Japanese personnel stationed in northern China. After that, he will go to a summer retreat. (1st - Special Dispatch)</p>

Zhang Ji then delivered a speech, first recounting the establishment of the National Government, then drawing historical examples from both Chinese and world history to explain the difficulty of creating a nation. He also stated that the establishment of the Republic of China has been 26 years. Recalling this past history, due to the swift and easy success of the Xinhai Revolution in overthrowing the Manchu Qing dynasty, comrades in the party inevitably had thoughts of complacency at the time, leading to Yuan Shikai's betrayal of the country. Since then, national affairs have become increasingly turbulent, until today in the 14th year of the Republic, when the Party, following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and enduring hardships, established the National Government in Guangzhou, and then marched north to lay the foundation for national unification. During these twelve years, thanks to the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who did not shy away from hardship in the revolution, we were finally able to overcome all difficulties. The future of national affairs has improved. Today, in this commemoration, we should never forget the difficulty of creating the nation, and we should carry forward the revolutionary spirit of striving to catch up, working diligently and sincerely uniting, and under the leadership of Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang, work together to complete the great task of national rejuvenation as soon as possible. The ceremony concluded with music at 10:00 a.m. (1st - Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Wang Chonghui Delivers a Radio Address to the United States</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] At the invitation of the Columbia Broadcasting System of the United States, Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui broadcast a speech in English to the entire United States from the Nanjing Central English Broadcasting Station from 7:15 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. on the 30th. The translation of the full text is as follows: Ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the people of your country from this side of the Pacific. Because of an invitation from the Columbia Broadcasting System to give a speech, I have this opportunity. I would like to express my gratitude to the station. Those of you who pay attention to Chinese affairs probably already know about the various advances in China today. Those of you who have not paid attention to Chinese affairs will be even more eager to hear the details. China is vast, and the lives of its people are constantly changing. The matter is complex and difficult to describe. In this short period of time, I can only select the main points to report to you. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, we have been working tirelessly on unification, eliminating all evil forces that are harmful to the foundation of the nation and the government. Today, the true national unification has been completed and is becoming stronger every day. This is what I am happy to report to you. The Chinese government knows that domestic peace and political stability are prerequisites for a strong country. Only in a situation of peace and stability can the plan for national rejuvenation be realized. Now that we have laid the foundation for the country, we are next engaged in economic construction and the development of national resources. Our work is difficult and arduous, but judging from the achievements of past efforts, it has given us infinite hope and courage. China is an agricultural country, and 80 percent of its population is engaged in agriculture. Therefore, I will first briefly describe the efforts of the Chinese government to improve agriculture. After years of internal and external troubles, what the people need most is peace and order. Therefore, in recent years, the government has worked hard to establish peace and order so that farmers can live and work in peace. Secondly, the government has also tried to relieve the rural economy. For example, in the past few years, the central government has abolished countless exorbitant taxes. In other aspects, the government also actively supports farmers, such as providing loans to avoid exploitation by usurers, encouraging the establishment of various cooperatives, developing transportation to help them sell agricultural products, and improving irrigation and cultivation methods to increase harvests. In addition, in order to improve agriculture, the government has also set up more than 700 agricultural experiment stations in various places to engage in agricultural research, improve the rural economy and rural organizations, and promote farmer education. In order to make full use of farmland and prevent natural disasters such as floods and droughts, the government has also extensively cultivated forests and dredged rivers. It is difficult to describe the detailed plans in detail. In a nutshell, the government's work to help farmers is large-scale and costly, but as an agricultural country, we can believe that this kind of work will bring infinite benefits in the future. This is still in terms of agriculture. Now, if we try to observe the transportation aspect, the National Government has made the most significant progress in this regard. Now, I will try to briefly explain the main points. The government's most diligent effort is to build a highway network that covers the entire country. In the past ten years, nearly 100,000 kilometers of highways have been completed. Remote and poor villages can be reached by light vehicles, and agricultural products can easily reach the market, which has greatly benefited farmers and promoted the revival of the rural economy. Most of the construction of this highway system is intended to facilitate transportation between the provinces, and at the same time, it is actually making them the feeder lines for various railways. Railways are still the main tool for long-distance freight transportation, and they will continue to be the important link between the various production areas and commerce in the country. In the past few years, the government has completed two new important railway lines, and has also improved other existing railways. Moreover, the reorganization of railway loans has restored China's railway credit and made it easier to raise capital for building new railways. Accompanying the rapid progress of land transportation is the rapid development of commercial aviation and radio communications. China now has five or six air routes, and various parts of the country have obtained rapid transportation and are connected to your country's great Pan American Airways. At the same time, our country's wired and radio networks are now rapidly spreading throughout the country. We can now talk to your countrymen across the ocean by radio telephone. Secondly, I would also like to ask your countrymen to pay attention to the financial reforms implemented by the National Government. Without these reforms, it would have been impossible for our country to achieve so much to date. Only with the determination and perseverance of the Chinese government has it been able to correct the chaos in the past monetary and taxation aspects and obtain light. Now, a unified monetary system and a unified taxation system are being promoted and advanced throughout the country, and there is a sincere effort to clear external debts and establish credit. In November 1935, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, the Chinese government implemented a bold and daring reform plan and decided to adopt a non-convertible managed currency system. This system has been warmly supported and completely successful by the people of the whole country, making China's finances healthy. China's national currency has a solid foundation in the international market. In order to make China's financial system more stable, the Chinese government is now planning to establish a central reserve bank, the content and organization of which are generally similar to your country's Federal Reserve Bank. The above is still in terms of material aspects. What is more important than material construction is the inculcation of a new spirit in the people. The Chinese people now have a new understanding of the concept of the country and of the general outlook on life. National self-awareness and a sense of community have flourished in the minds of the Chinese people, which is different from the past. There is now a new morality that sweeps the country, and the spirit of service is flourishing. This is the so-called New Life Movement. This New Life Movement was initiated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in 1934, and its purpose is to build a new morality to support national revival, that is, to establish a new model of mass action based on the old Chinese morality of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and to promote people to live a rational, useful, and productive life, and to promote their understanding of the meaning of accuracy, obedience, and responsibility. Our grand vision is to strengthen the character of the Chinese people in order to revive China. Our country is aware of its own difficulties on the one hand, and is deeply convinced of its own strength on the other. Therefore, we bury our heads in hard work and are determined to obtain our country's due position in the current world. Therefore, we have laid the foundation for a new Chinese society, politics, and economy at home, and we want to go further and do our best to contribute to world peace and prosperity. Judging from the various facts in recent years, it is enough to prove that China can rely on its own strength to achieve great things, and it is enough to prove that if China is given the opportunity and is not hindered by other forces, it can plan the reorganization and revival of the whole country. This so-called opportunity is what we need and what we cannot do without. The Chinese people love peace and have never changed their minds for thousands of years. From now on, this will be the case even more. We firmly believe that peace is the prerequisite for domestic development, and we firmly believe that international peace is the key to world prosperity. Today, countries are interdependent and closely related. Only by vigorously engaging in friendly cooperation can we seek the highest welfare of mankind, and only by strictly adhering to international peace treaties can we avoid the recurrence of war. People on both sides of China and the United States have the same ideals on this point, which we are very gratified. Over the years, the United States has upheld international justice, been concerned about world peace, and worked tirelessly without懈, which has long been admired by us. We are especially congratulating ourselves that we have such good friends and neighbors in today's world. (1st - Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Beijing Arrests Major Swindler Hu Wennong</h3>

<h3>Thorough Investigation of Speculation Incidents</h3>

<p>The speculation and manipulation wave in the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange has been unfolding for two weeks. As a result of the earnest and thorough investigation by both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, the administrative penalties for the brokers and directors of the exchange were announced on the 28th. According to news reports yesterday, President Chiang also telegraphed an order to temporarily remove and detain Wu Qiding, Director of the Tax Affairs Department, and Sheng Shengyi, Director of the Jiangsu Consolidated Tax Bureau, for investigation. It is still difficult for us to judge whether Wu and Sheng are involved in this speculation wave. If it is true, then today's investigation is a deserved punishment for Wu and Sheng. In terms of China's officialdom, it is also a sign of progress. The long-standing habit of "officials protecting each other" in China can be eliminated as a result, and the so-called "upright and honest" politics will have a starting point. The purification of officialdom that the people have longed for for more than 20 years of the Republic has now become a reality.</p>
<p>Historically, the biggest shortcoming of Chinese officialdom lies in its inability to overcome "favoritism." They all regard officialdom as an "official sea," believing that there is no stability in rise and fall, so there is no need to be overly critical. Therefore, among colleagues, they knowingly overlook wrongdoings and are unwilling to expose crimes. This leads to procrastination and the deterioration of officialdom. Generally, those who keep themselves clean embrace the mentality of "monks tolling bells," while those who seek profit take advantage of their power and opportunities to engage in wrongdoing. The speculation and manipulation of public officials today is one example of this.</p>
<p>The economic development of a country has its own trajectory, and there should be no obstacles in the middle of the trajectory. Manipulation through speculation is sufficient to hinder the operation on the trajectory. Taking the yarn and flower market in recent days as an example, the price has plummeted by more than 40 yuan. If there had been no previous rise of 40 or 50 yuan, there would never have been such a drastic drop of 40 or 50 yuan today. The impact of this drastic rise and fall of 40 or 50 yuan on social stability and order should be significant. The financial resources of businessmen, the entire economic development, are all deeply affected. Such improper speculation and manipulation, even if it comes from a private individual, the state should impose appropriate sanctions. Moreover, according to reports, it comes from public officials. Therefore, President Chiang's measures will not only correctly correct the shortcomings of officialdom in the past, but also enable the entire Chinese economic development to gradually enter the right track. However, in addition to this administrative penalty, we still hope that there can be a judicial penalty, with a spirit of impartiality and fairness.</p>
<h3>US Assistance to China's Construction Benefits Both Countries</h3>
<p>Vice President Kong Expresses Great Satisfaction with Economic Assistance from the Export-Import Bank</p>
<p>[Washington] Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, made a statement to reporters here today, saying that the Export-Import Bank has provided financial assistance to the Ministry of Railways of the Chinese government to purchase American locomotives and railway equipment, which is the beginning of the bank's cooperation with China in industrial development. The Chinese government welcomes this move, as it is another proof of Sino-American cooperation. It is gratifying that your government previously sent Pierson, President of the Export-Import Bank, to China to investigate and collect accurate information on China's economic development and business prospects. When President Pierson traveled in our country, he not only visited major ports but also traveled deep into the interior. Wherever he went, he left a good impression. President Pierson was able to bring back the good impressions he gained during his visit to the United States, and I cannot help but express my satisfaction with this. The current industrial development plan in China requires American machinery and materials, which provides American manufacturers and international traders with an immediate opportunity. In the past, the Export-Import Bank and the Chinese government cooperated on cotton and wheat loans, and the results have been satisfactory and beneficial to both countries. The current initiative is the concrete result of President Pierson's visit to China, and its impact will surely benefit both countries. (30th - Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>American Political Commentator Publishes an Article</h3>
<p>The United States is Willing to Assist China in Construction, So that it Can Succeed</p>
<p>[Washington] The Washington Post published an article on the front page today by its political commentator, Walter Lippmann, entitled "The United States Will Provide Economic Assistance to Democratic Countries." The article began by saying that the actions of the United States yesterday have strengthened the democratic systems in Europe and Asia and made the unity of the American countries more consolidated. The US government has renewed its guarantee to China, Belgium, France, and Britain for sympathetic cooperation in economic undertakings, and therefore, it is closer to the democratic group. The article continued to say that President Roosevelt had a meeting with Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China. Although President Roosevelt only said after the meeting that he would meet with Vice President Kong again on Tuesday, Kong's visit to the United States has made the friendly relations between China and the United States closer. This can be proved by Jones, the general director of the US Reconstruction Bank Corporation, who said that the National Export-Import Bank has agreed to assist China in purchasing American locomotives and vehicles. China has ordered 20 locomotives from Baldwin Locomotive Works and American Locomotive Company, worth US$1.5 million. The US authorities are very pleased to hear about the strengthening of China's national strength and the stability of its political situation. Vice President Kong's visit has been warmly welcomed by all parties. Indeed, a strong and independent China is the only guarantee of peace in East Asia. We sincerely hope that our efforts for China will succeed. The article concluded by saying that we should continue to express our opposition to Japan's invasion of Chinese territory, Italy's conquest of Abyssinia, and the interference of Italy and Germany in the Spanish civil war.

<h3>Kado Discusses Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>England and the United States Lend to China, Japan is Also Willing to Participate</p>
<p>[Berlin] The 10th Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce has decided to convene in Tokyo, Japan. Kado Jukuro (i.e., the leader of the Economic Survey Group to Europe and the United States), the chief representative of Japan, recently gave an interview to a Havas reporter, expressing his gratification and mentioning the relationship between China and Japan, saying, "We deeply recognize the great value of the unification achieved by General Chiang Kai-shek, the President of the Executive Yuan of China, and we sincerely hope that China will be peaceful and prosperous. This is the same as that of England. China is the main market for Japanese goods, and China's prosperity is related to Japan's rise and fall. Japan's attitude towards China has recently become more moderate, and that is why." Kado then spoke about the issue of international loans to China, saying, "If England and France lend funds to China, Japan should also come out to participate. However, Japan is not a wealthy country and can only provide a small amount of funds." As for Japan's economic intentions, foreign friends can all understand them. "Yesterday, I opposed various economic nationalisms at the International Chamber of Commerce and insisted on abolishing tariff barriers and advocating the open-door policy. In order to reduce unemployment, Japan has to seek outlets for its goods and therefore adopts the old method of selling cheaply, but it is not a so-called sale at a loss." Finally, Kado expressed his opposition to the proposal to establish a joint operating agency internationally. (Central News Agency, 1st - Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese-Russian Conflict in Heilongjiang, Situation Unlikely to Escalate</h3>
<p>Japanese Four-Minister Conference Decides to Treat the Case as a Local Incident</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the incident of Japanese and Soviet gunboats clashing near Ganquezzi Island in the Heilongjiang River, the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated that it hoped that the Soviet government would quickly withdraw its troops and gunboats concentrated there to avoid making the situation more serious. The Soviet government's attitude is still unclear. According to general observation, Ganquezzi and Xingqinanhuo Islands themselves will not become a serious problem, because the two islands are flooded for nine months of the year, and their area is very small, with almost no military or economic value. The current dispute is about navigation in the waterways near the islands. According to the Japanese-Soviet waterway agreement, the boundary line is located in the middle of the Heilongjiang River, with the north belonging to the Soviet Union and the south belonging to Japanese Manchuria. At present, the river south of the island is very narrow, and only the north is suitable for navigation, so the dispute occurred. The focus of the current problem lies in whether both sides abide by the conditions agreed upon during the talks between Shigemitsu Aoi, the Japanese ambassador to Russia, and Maxim Litvinov, the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, and withdraw their troops and warships as stipulated. From the perspective of the general situation, it seems that the two countries do not intend to expand the dispute over these islands and routes, resulting in a serious break. (1st - Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Soviet Russian Embassy announced today that the Soviet Russian government has proposed to the Japanese side that the troops of the two countries be withdrawn from the vicinity of the two islands in the Heilongjiang River, and it has also re-proposed that the two sides organize a committee to determine the border.

<h3>Diplomatic Negotiations Between Japan and Russia</h3>
<p>[Moscow] Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Mamoru Shigemitsu, received instructions from the Foreign Ministry and met with Deputy Foreign Minister Stomonyakov of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs at 00:00 on the 1st to lodge a strong protest regarding the Kanchatz Island incident. Deputy Foreign Minister Stomonyakov also expressed the views of the Soviet government. The meeting lasted three hours before he departed. He then visited Foreign Minister Litvinov later that day to discuss the withdrawal of troops from the Heilongjiang River bank again. (1st, Dōmei News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Foreign Ministry issued a statement last night, saying that the government, unable to understand the Soviet attitude, had instructed Ambassador Shigemitsu to lodge a strong protest with the Soviet government. (1st, Dōmei News Agency)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigemitsu, after negotiating with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov for two days, claimed that if Soviet troops did not withdraw from the two disputed islands in the Heilongjiang River, Japan would "take responsive measures." Shigemitsu also stated that the Soviets had deployed thirty small gunboats in the Heilongjiang River, and a large number of troops were concentrated on the shore, while the puppet "Manchukuo" only had four or five divisions. Currently, there is no new information regarding the report of the Soviet gunboat being sunk yesterday. Ambassador Shigemitsu told the press that he firmly believed the Soviets would withdraw their troops and denied issuing a final warning to the Soviets, stating that if they did not withdraw, war would be declared. Shigemitsu stated that Japan only recognized the Soviet-"Manchu" border line as specified in the 1860 Sino-Russian Treaty and could not recognize the Russian claim that a secret copy of the treaty had a red line marking the two islands as belonging to Russian territory. (1st, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet government requested Ambassador Shigemitsu yesterday evening to discuss the Kanchatz Island issue. Shigemitsu immediately dispatched First Secretary Miyakawa to the Soviet Foreign Ministry at 7:30 PM to meet with the newly appointed Ambassador to Japan, Kozlovsky. Regarding this incident, Kozlovsky protested to Japan, pointing out that the Japanese and "Manchu" forces had bombarded Soviet warships, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries among the crew. Miyakawa refuted this by explaining that the Soviet warships had crossed the border into Manchu territory and engaged in illegal firing, and lodged a protest. The two men held talks for an hour without reaching an agreement. It seems that diplomatic authorities of the two countries will continue to negotiate this issue in the future.

<h3>Four Ministers Conference in Japan Discusses Aftermath</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, Foreign Minister Hirota, Army Minister Sugiyama, and Navy Minister Yonai held a four-minister conference at 11:00 AM this morning to discuss measures to deal with the aftermath of the Kanchatz Island incident. Foreign Minister Hirota reported on the situation of Japanese Ambassador to Russia Mamoru Shigemitsu's three-hour talk with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Stomonyakov, which began at 1:00 AM this morning. It is reported that the conference decided to adopt a policy of not escalating the tense situation. If the Soviet Union immediately withdraws its armed forces, Japan is also prepared to begin negotiations for a settlement, with the restoration of the original state as a prerequisite. (1st, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Central Department of the Japanese Army has received an official report regarding the Kanchatz Island incident in the Heilongjiang River, and its view on this incident is as follows: As a result of Ambassador Shigemitsu's meeting with Foreign Minister Litvinov, it was confirmed that the Soviet Union would withdraw its assembled troops. However, immediately after the conclusion of these talks, Soviet warships openly crossed the border during the daytime and engaged in illegal firing on Japanese and "Manchu" troops, which is enough to prove how irresponsible the Soviet authorities are and how much they disregard international trust. The self-defense actions of the Japanese and "Manchu" armies are a natural obligation of an independent state. Regardless of what kind of situation develops in the future, it depends on the behavior of the Soviet Union, and the responsibility lies with the Soviet Union. The first step in resolving this problem is for the Soviet Union to withdraw its troops as soon as possible in accordance with the results of the Shigemitsu-Litvinov talks.

<h3>Soviet Authorities Remain Silent</h3>
<p>[Moscow] Regarding the widespread rumor that a Soviet gunboat was shelled and sunk by Japanese and puppet Manchu forces on the Heilongjiang River, the Japanese Embassy here still expresses complete ignorance. However, the Japanese side believes that three Soviet gunboats entering the waters belonging to "Manchukuo" constitutes a "provocative act," and it has been confirmed that the country's ambassador to Russia, Mamoru Shigemitsu, will lodge a protest with the Soviet Union in the near future. On the Soviet authorities' side, no opinion has been expressed regarding the sinking of the gunboat at this time. (Central News Agency, 30th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>Conflicting Accounts of the Clash</h3>
<p>[Moscow] Blagoveshchensk reports that on June 29, a puppet gunboat sailed to the vicinity of Tsekufsky Island (Shennuka Island) in the Heilongjiang River and opened fire on Soviet sentries. After the Soviet side returned fire, Japanese and puppet forces bombarded a Soviet gunboat patrolling the Soviet riverbank from the Manchu side, resulting in damage to the ship and the deaths of two crew members and injuries to three others. The Japanese puppet gunboat was captured by a Soviet guard ship and taken to the Soviet shore. (1st, TASS) According to an announcement issued by the Kwantung Army last night, three Russian gunboats had previously invaded the Heilongjiang River south of Senufa (transliteration Jin) Island and fired on Japanese and "Manchu" troops stationed there. The Japanese and "Manchu" armies had no choice but to return fire, resulting in the sinking of one of them, heavy damage to another, and the forced departure of the third. From the surface, it appears that the Japanese and "Manchu" armies suffered no losses. Afterward, "Manchukuo" immediately lodged a protest with the Soviet government. Changchun believes the situation is serious and claims that the "Manchu" government has decided to take a strong and fair attitude to ensure the freedom of navigation on the border rivers is unimpeded.

<h3>Britain and Germany Observe the Situation in the Far East</h3>
<p>[London] Newspapers publish news that a Soviet gunboat was shelled and sunk by Japanese troops on the Heilongjiang River, and Japan-Soviet relations have suddenly become tense. Responsible parties have not yet received an official report regarding this incident, so they are unwilling to express any opinion. However, according to well-informed sources, if the tension between Japan and Russia reaches a dangerous level, the British government will appeal to both sides to adopt a moderate attitude. In particular, it is more appropriate for the UK to offer advice to Japan, as Anglo-Japanese negotiations will begin soon in London. (Central News Agency, 30th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Berlin newspapers today carried news of the Russo-Japanese conflict in large headlines, with detailed reports of the Soviet gunboat shelling Japanese "puppet" border troops and the incidents on the Heilongjiang Islands. However, the newspapers have not yet published commentary. Germany is paying close attention to the development of this incident. (1st, Guomin Huitong News Agency)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the sinking of a Soviet gunboat on the Heilongjiang River by Japanese "Manchu" warships, only the Socialist People's Newspaper and the Radical Socialist New Era Newspaper have expressed opinions, both of which are highly critical. The People's Newspaper reported, "Japanese soldiers seize every opportunity to provoke incidents at the border between Russia and 'Manchukuo.' Fortunately, Moscow is still unwilling to have a conflict with Japan, and the peace situation in the Far East will not be destroyed as a result, unless Japan wants to take advantage of the current situation in Europe for its own selfish plans." The New Era Newspaper reported, "The reason for the tension between Japan and Russia can be found in the thinking of Japanese soldiers. The Soviet side is still able to remain calm and act from a defensive standpoint, and this should be given great attention." (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>Tōhō Newspaper Comments on Sino-Japanese Issues</h3>
<p>Advocates China Diplomacy, Abandoning Lenient Policies</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Chūgai Shōgyō Shimbun's editorial today is titled "The True Mission of Adjusting Sino-Japanese Relations." The newspaper first criticized China for taking an extremely indifferent attitude toward adjusting relations, stating that China's attitude is attributable to Japan's decision to maintain the status quo with China, causing China to believe that Japan has become passive, and thus its attitude has become more assertive. The newspaper then expressed its opinion, stating, "In order to cope with the current situation, Japan should pursue the same policies as before, although the methods may change, there is no need to change the entirety of the basic policy. China insists on resolving political issues first, intending to eliminate the special nature of North China. This is merely an arbitrary conclusion based on results rather than causes. Although we also hope to resolve political issues first, when discussing political issues, the 'Manchuria' issue should be raised first. The special nature of North China comes from the 'Manchuria' issue. If the 'Manchuria' issue is not resolved, the North China issue cannot be resolved." The newspaper concluded, "In view of the current Sino-Japanese relations, it is necessary to abandon all lenient policies and move forward toward resolving the fundamental issues." In summary, from the above editorial, we can predict the future of Sino-Japanese relations to a great extent. (1st, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>French Government Sets Four Principles for Financial Stabilization</h3>
<p>Gold Content of the Franc to Be Determined Separately; Currency Value to Be Allowed to Fluctuate Freely; Bank of France to Loan to the Government</p>
<p>[Paris] After the fiscal reform bill proposed by the government was passed by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, the Cabinet held a State Council meeting this afternoon and passed an order, the contents of which are as follows: 1. The Monetary Law promulgated on October 1, 1936, which stipulates the maximum and minimum limits of the gold content of the franc (originally, the franc contained 0.0655 grams of pure gold; the Monetary Law last year stipulated that the maximum gold content was 0.049 grams and the minimum was 0.043 grams) is hereby repealed. 2. The legal gold content of the franc and the conditions for exchanging banknotes for cash will be specified in a separate order to be issued at a later date. 3. Before the legal gold content of the franc is determined, the exchange rate between the franc and the currencies of various countries shall be adjusted by the Exchange Equalization Fund. 4. The government order of June 28, 1937, which stipulates that commercial bills may be paid in cash or foreign currency, may be extended for payment, is hereby repealed. In addition, a new contract was signed between the Bank of France and the government, stipulating that the bank may lend 15,000,000,000 francs to the government. The stock exchange is scheduled to reopen tomorrow, while commodity exchanges in various places will remain temporarily closed. (Central News Agency, 30th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>[Paris] The purchase price of gold has now been set at 28,959 francs per kilogram, equivalent to an exchange rate of 128.75 francs per British pound. (Central News Agency, 1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Paris] Responsible individuals have recently commented on the financial measures adopted by the Congress, believing that former Prime Minister Poincaré used the period from 1926 to 1928 as a trial period to stabilize the franc, and only in June 1928 did he truly stabilize the franc. The current government should also emulate this method and allow the franc to fluctuate freely for a long period of time. Only after the franc has in fact returned to a stable state should it issue an order to determine its legal parity. In the future, the franc will fluctuate within a wider range, and speculative activities can be curbed as a result. In addition, the 10,000,000,000 francs of the Exchange Equalization Fund has almost been exhausted and urgently needs to be replenished in order to adjust the exchange market. The Bank of France should also continue to purchase gold in accordance with world market prices. (Central News Agency, 30th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>Franc Resumes Trading</h3>
<p>Prices Fall in London and Paris; One Pound Equals Approximately 123 Francs</p>
<p>[London] After the foreign exchange market reopened this morning, brokers frequently received phone calls inquiring about the price of the franc, but most of them did not result in transactions. Initially, short covering kept prices stable, hovering around 123 francs per British pound. However, before long, buying interest disappeared, and speculators rushed to sell. The reason for this is that official quarters did not appear to be taking action to support the franc. The price then rapidly declined, falling to 129, with subsequent fluctuations, but generally between 129 and 127. The closing price on Sunday was 110.53. Well-informed sources are unwilling to comment on the prospects of the franc, as the procedure for reforming the currency by French Finance Minister Germain-Martin is good in principle, but the result depends on the application of this principle. (Central News Agency, 1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Paris] After the enactment of the fiscal reform bill, the stock exchange here reopened today. When the franc-sterling exchange rate opened, it was 123 francs and 25 centimes, and the franc-dollar exchange rate was 24 francs and 90 centimes. It then fell to 129 francs and 26 centimes at 1:30 PM. When the market closed, the sterling exchange rate rebounded to 128 francs and 93 centimes, while the dollar exchange rate fell to 26 francs and 6 centimes. Compared with the closing price on June 28, this exchange rate fell by about 12 percent. In addition, the prices of various securities on the stock exchange have risen, averaging about 10 percent, especially foreign securities. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>[Paris] After the reopening of the stock exchange, the exchange rate was 126 francs per pound sterling and 26 francs per US dollar at 1:30 PM. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>[New York] People in the foreign exchange market here now believe that the decline in the price of the franc is a manifestation of France's withdrawal from the Tripartite Monetary Agreement, which has become a reality, but France has not yet made a formal announcement. The first transaction price for spot francs today was US$4 per 100 francs. The number of transactions was very small, purely for commercial purposes. Later, there were some short coverings. Several banks posted rates ranging from US$4.13 to US$4.15 per 100 francs. (Central News Agency, 30th, New York Agency)</p>
<h3>Senate Discusses the Situation</h3>
<p>[Paris] The fiscal reform bill proposed by the government has now been passed by the Senate with 167 votes to 82. After the Senate convened at 3:15 PM, the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Garde, first delivered a declaration, stating that the Finance Committee originally wanted to declare its success in restoring the balance of the budget. However, the Finance Committee refused the fiscal full-powers bill proposed by the previous Blum cabinet because it feared the implementation of nationalization policies. Garde then praised Finance Minister Germain-Martin, saying that he presented an honest report on the fiscal situation, without any embellishment. In addition, Germain-Martin also sent a letter to the Finance Committee, promising that exchange controls would never be implemented. Therefore, for these reasons, it is hoped that the Senate will approve the government's bill and grant the government broad powers. Finance Minister Germain-Martin then took the floor and repeated the figures he had presented to the Chamber of Deputies yesterday regarding the fiscal situation, and explained that economic and fiscal recovery must be carried out simultaneously. Finally, Prime Minister Chautemps personally took the stage to deliver a declaration, stating that if the fiscal situation is not urgently rectified, it will be difficult for social progress to be effective. The current cabinet does not intend to reverse the policies of the previous Blum cabinet. What it wants is to reconcile the opinions of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies to achieve unity. (Central News Agency, 30th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>[Paris] The speech delivered by Garde, the rapporteur of the French Budget Committee, today is considered to be a criticism of the previous Blum cabinet. He stated that the reason why the Senate was unwilling to grant fiscal privileges to the Blum cabinet but restored the privileges to the new government was because it feared that the Blum cabinet would use these privileges to implement its policies of coercion and nationalization, and not just for the country's recovery. Garde further stated that some said that the Senate was unable to crack down on speculators, which was a slander of the Senate. However, the Senate had demanded a balanced budget, but felt that the Blum government's borrowing from the treasury had reached the point of being completely exhausted. The Socialists were extremely angry upon hearing the above remarks, and former Finance Minister Auriol, upon hearing Garde's speech, should have had it posted, but left his seat in anger. However, Garde's speech was not posted afterward, for fear of harming the feelings between the two houses. (Central News Agency, 30th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Hull Reaffirms Peace Policy</h3>
<p>Belgian Prime Minister Leaves the United States to Return Home</p>
<p>[Washington] After President Roosevelt concluded his final talks with Belgian Prime Minister Janson, Secretary of State Hull recently expressed his opinion, stating, "If the living conditions of various nations are not improved, there is fear that stable peace is unattainable." He also said that after Prime Minister Janson, it is possible that politicians from various countries will come to Washington to continue to study the world's economic and political situation with the US authorities, and that the policies advocated by the US government to resolve various issues in international relations are in fact the policies decided at the Pan-American Peace Conference in Argentina's capital last December. (Central News Agency, 30th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>[New York] Secretary of State Hull made a statement to reporters today, elaborating on a document jointly issued by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Janson yesterday, stating that the United States now has a strong feeling that the time is ripe to adopt a peaceful resolution, organization, and restoration process for extremely important international relations, replacing the frenzied arms race that exists elsewhere in the world and the narrow-minded methods of obstructing commerce that are practiced in some countries. Hull's remarks have aroused speculation as to whether the US government is prepared to take concrete action after Belgian Prime Minister Janson's visit to the US to seek world recovery. Janson has boarded the French ship Normandie to return to Europe. He is very optimistic about the talks in Washington, but said that he cannot make public statements until he returns to his country and discusses the matter with members of the government.

<p>British and American Finance Ministers Declare Current Situation; Authorities of the Three Countries in Close Contact</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the maintenance of the current monetary agreement, Britain, France, and the United States have recently established a new agreement, and the governments of Britain and the United States will issue a declaration in a short period of time. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau recently told the press that the current monetary agreement between Britain, France, and the United States will not change due to the situation in France. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The financial authorities of Britain, France, and the United States are actively conducting negotiations today in order to maintain cooperation under the new franc situation in accordance with the tripartite currency agreement. Regarding this matter, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon declared in the House of Commons this afternoon, "The French government has given me assurances that it will continue to cooperate closely with Britain and the United States, and this is also the desire of our government. I am now in close contact with the financial authorities of France and the United States." Regarding the negotiations between Britain, France, and the United States, financial figures recently stated that the purpose of the negotiations is to: 1. Determine the future mutual relations of the exchange equalization funds of the three countries (the French government has given assurances to the British Treasury that even though the franc has reached this situation, Britain can still use francs to buy gold in Paris); 2. Establish at least a trial parity for the exchange rate of the franc so that the British Exchange Equalization Fund can help maintain the price of the franc. Financial figures also said that the exchange rate of the franc against the pound sterling will be approximately 165 francs per pound. (Central News Agency, 30th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon said in the House of Commons today regarding the French monetary system that he knew that the Chautemps government had requested Parliament to grant it special powers to deal with the fiscal situation, but before these real powers were obtained and implemented, it was impossible to describe the details. What is generally known is that the revaluation of the franc in September last year failed to fully complete the tripartite currency balance that the tripartite monetary agreement sought to create. Simon added that he knew that the abolition of the upper and lower price limits of the franc was to adjust the current situation, but according to the French government's statement to him, the French government had no intention of seeking exchange rate benefits from this and would continue to cooperate closely with the governments of Britain and the United States. Simon concluded, "This aspiration is also the aspiration of the British government. For this matter, I am constantly discussing closely with the finance ministers of France and the United States." (Central News Agency, 30th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Washington] US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today that he did not want to rush to criticize the monetary situation until France had completed its legislation and the US Treasury Department had sufficient time to study this legislation. Around 10:30 AM on Thursday, Morgenthau will be able to express his opinion if he has been informed of France's proposals. Although the US Treasury Department has repeatedly communicated with the French government via transatlantic wireless telephone, it still does not know the details of the measures that French Prime Minister Chautemps plans to take.

<p>[Washington] Senior exchange rate personnel told the Associated Press today that if the French fiscal plan succeeds, it will be enough to relieve the pressure on the United States to lower the price of gold. The purpose of the French fiscal plan is to: 1. Prevent the outflow of gold; 2. Restore credit and allow overseas funds to return to France. (30th, Guomin News Agency)</p>

Carol II and the Polish authorities have discussed various relevant issues and have confirmed that both sides share the same interests. The primary purpose of the alliance treaty between the two Baltic states is to maintain peace, which has also been explicitly expressed."

<h3>Britain and France Reserve Their Final Stance on Spain</h3>
<p>Supervision Plan Still Under Negotiation, Britain Determined Not to Recognize Belligerent Groups</p>
<p>[London] If the Non-Intervention Committee does not accept the proposal for Britain and France to undertake full maritime surveillance of Spain tomorrow, then Britain and France may reserve their attitude toward the entire non-intervention policy. Britain is willing to undertake surveillance work off the Mediterranean coast of Spain and is willing to accommodate neutral country observers stationed on British surveillance warships for inspection at any time to demonstrate fairness. However, there are doubts about the lack of bias of Germany and Italy toward Britain's intentions, so there are slight disagreements. If the non-intervention plan turns out to be a pipe dream, then the Spanish civil war will be prolonged indefinitely because both warring parties can freely obtain military supplies from land and sea. (Central News Agency, 1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] Recently, some people have advocated recognizing the rights of the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups to preserve the non-intervention agreement. According to sources, during this morning's cabinet meeting, Foreign Secretary Eden and several other cabinet members opposed this approach, arguing that if this were to become a reality, it would be seen as Britain making concessions to fascist countries, and it would definitely trigger a violent backlash in British public opinion and would be sufficient to fuel the Labour Party's propaganda campaign against the government. Therefore, the cabinet did not finalize its attitude, but it is believed that Britain will not recognize the parties involved in the Spanish civil war as belligerent groups in the near future. It is generally believed that the Foreign Office now intends to reapply to Germany and Italy, urging those countries to accept the new surveillance plan proposed by Britain and France, and to send personnel from neutral countries to board British and French warships to conduct inspections. (Central News Agency, 30th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] There is no doubt that Germany and Italy will ultimately reject the new Spanish maritime surveillance plan proposed by Britain and France. French Ambassador Corbin met with Foreign Secretary Eden and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Robert Vansittart this afternoon to discuss the situation that this might cause. It is believed that Britain and France will now make extensive efforts to maintain the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish civil war, even after the surveillance plan is abolished.

<h3>Roosevelt Attends Wedding</h3>
<p>Turning Political Foes into In-Laws</p>
<p>⊙Wilmington: US President Roosevelt's third son, Franklin, and Ethel, daughter of the famous chemical pigment manufacturer DuPont, announced their engagement on November 14th of last year, and today they will hold their wedding ceremony at the DuPont mansion. 1,300 guests will attend, and President Roosevelt will also attend, accompanied by three companies of armed soldiers for protection. It is well known that the DuPont family has always opposed President Roosevelt's policies. During last year's presidential election, the DuPont family provided huge sums to aid the Republican Party's campaign expenses for the candidate Landon. Therefore, when the news of the engagement of the two families' children spread, newspapers immediately called it a comedy of turning political foes into a beautiful couple.

<h3>London Naval Treaty</h3>
<p>Britain to Approve Soon</p>
<p>[London] The naval treaty signed by Britain, the United States, and France in London on March 25th of last year has lasted for more than a year, and the signatory countries have not yet exchanged instruments of ratification. During the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, Labour MP Henderson (son of the late chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson) questioned Foreign Secretary Eden about this matter. Eden replied that Britain would ratify this naval treaty "in the shortest possible time" (Note: the United States and France have already ratified it). As for the reason for the delay in ratification, it is due to the fact that Britain is holding separate naval negotiations with Germany and the Soviet Union, which have not yet been concluded. In addition, according to those in charge, the British-German and British-Russian naval treaties will both be signed within the next week. It has been found that the German side had previously requested to build five 10,000-ton cruisers, and the Soviet Union requested Germany to reduce the construction of two 10,000-ton cruisers, so that the Soviet Union could accept the construction of only seven 8,000-ton cruisers, but this was rejected by Germany. The problem of the ratio of the quantity of ships built by Germany and Russia then caused disputes. Subsequently, Britain believed that 10,000-ton cruisers were originally prohibited by last year's London Naval Treaty, and that these types of warships would be eliminated sooner or later, so it advocated that the number of 10,000-ton cruisers should not be mentioned in the draft British-German and British-Russian naval treaties. This has now been accepted by the Soviet Union. Therefore, after the British-German and British-Russian naval treaties are signed, they should be ratified immediately by the British Parliament and their respective parliaments. The British government should try to exchange instruments of ratification for last year's London Three-Nation Naval Treaty as soon as possible, because the qualitative restrictions of the Three-Nation Naval Treaty are the basis for both the British-German and British-Russian naval treaties, and they can only take effect after the Three-Nation Naval Treaty is ratified.

<h3>Steel Industry Strike in the United States, Labor and Management at a Standstill</h3>
<p>Government Mediation Fails</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt recently appointed prominent figures from the business community, such as Taft, to organize a steel industry strike mediation committee. The committee is now expected to draft a report tomorrow, and its conclusion is that the mediation attempt has completely failed. Therefore, the Department of Labor is now prepared to take other actions to resolve the strike in the near future. Also, after President Roosevelt held talks with Taft, chairman of the mediation committee, today, he stated that the extremists on both labor and management sides are facing off against each other, forming a stalemate. Therefore, although the president previously gave unqualified support to the movement led by Lewis, leader of the Industrial Improvement Association, he has now publicly stated that he will no longer provide assistance and is prepared to have the federal government act as an arbitrator to resolve the strike. However, some observers believe that it may not be possible to force labor and management to accept the arbitration award, because according to federal law, the president does not have this power, and the decisions taken by the "Labor Relations Board" should also be voluntarily accepted by both labor and management and cannot be forced to comply.

<h3>German Defense Minister Inspects Hungarian Troops</h3>
<p>⊙Hungarian Capital: German Defense Minister General von Blomberg today attended a grand review of the Hungarian Army. Other invitees included Hungarian Foreign Minister Kánya, German Ambassador to Hungary Aumannsdorff, and many other dignitaries from both Germany and Hungary. In the afternoon, Blomberg accepted an invitation from Hungarian Regent Horthy and went to his country villa for dinner and is scheduled to return to the Hungarian capital tomorrow. (30th, National Maritime News)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Newspapers here claim that the purpose of German Defense Minister General von Blomberg's visit to Hungary is to enhance the friendly relations between Germany and Hungary. Germany and Hungary were allies on the same front during the Great War. They also claimed that Blomberg's visit has nothing to do with Hungary's inability to reorganize due to the restrictions of the Treaty of Trianon. However, the restrictions on armaments violate the principles of national honor and international morality. Therefore, with Blomberg's visit, the German people have a unanimous desire: that Hungary immediately obtains the rights to independence and equal treatment in order to maintain the security of its borders.

<h3>Hungarian Parliament Passes Regency Law</h3>
<p>⊙Hungarian Capital: The Hungarian Parliament today unanimously passed the Regency Law, but the Socialist Party members withdrew from the meeting before the vote. The law is a government proposal that stipulates the election and powers of the Regent. The law emphasizes the independence of the head of state from the parliament. The President has the right to send the bills passed by the parliament back to the parliament for reconsideration within six months. However, after the parliament has passed the original bill for the third time, the Regent must sign and announce it, but may still postpone the date of implementation by one year. Regarding the election of the head of state, the Regent can nominate three candidates, and the parliament also has the right to nominate. When the Regent is in office, the functions are exercised by the State Council on his behalf. The election of the Regent is carried out by a joint meeting of the upper and lower houses in secret. The Regency Law also grants the Regent the powers of the Hungarian King. (1st, National Maritime News)</p>

<h3>Japanese have Obtained a Monopoly on Economic Power in North China</h3>
<p>Investment in Tianjin Reaches 50 Million Yuan; Future Expansion Still Planned</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Over the past two years, according to a recent survey by the Municipal Social Bureau, Japanese companies have purchased or built various factories in Tianjin, including four dye factories, one tobacco factory, one vegetable oil factory, five protective film factories, and a total of thirty-three factories for spinning, wool weaving, glass, matches, etc. In total, there are currently forty-four factories in operation. Among the ninety-three factories in Tianjin with a capital of 200,000 yuan or more, excluding small handicraft factories, forty-three are operated by Chinese, and twenty-eight are operated by Europeans and Americans. However, factories built by Japanese companies are the most numerous. In total, the forty-four Japanese factories have a total investment of 50 million yuan. The factory with the most capital accounts for 5 million yuan, and the factory with the least capital has more than 200,000 yuan. The various factories that are currently under construction and planned are not included in this figure. If we include the investment in various yarn factories, paper factories, flour factories, and chemical monitoring factories that are currently under construction, the investment in just one corner of Hebei Province will reach approximately 150 million yuan next year (including the capital of the Twelve Spinning and Weaving Stock Company). If we add the capital of the Japanese Army Headquarters, Oriental Development Company, Xingzhong Company, Electric Company, and the investment amount determined by the North China Economic Development Company, the number will be even more alarming. Therefore, the Japanese have almost monopolized the economic power in North China.</p>
<p>This spring, various Japanese spinning and weaving companies planned to invest in North China to build large spinning mills. Later, because the Japanese Ministry of Finance managed foreign exchange and restricted the outflow of funds, the companies could not invest in North China as they wished. Even with the Japanese Army Headquarters acting as an intermediary, there was still no easing of restrictions. The spinning companies that were approved by the Ministry of Finance to invest in North China were Wu Yu, Kishiwada, Shanghai, and San Spinning Company, while the rest were restricted from the outflow of funds. Therefore, the civil Japanese North China spinning and weaving front, which originally planned to complete 1.4 million spindles next year, has suffered a setback. The Japanese Xingzhong Company recently established the North China Association jointly with the Osaka Cotton Industry Association to handle cotton exports and cotton mortgage loans. The capital is 5 million yuan, with Xingzhong contributing 2.5 million yuan, the Osaka Cotton Industry contributing 1.5 million yuan, and the remaining 1 million yuan being raised by the North China Association. They will purchase 100,000 ping of land in Tianjin Special District No. 1 to build cotton warehouses and packing factories. The construction cost of the warehouse is 360,000 yuan, and the packing factory is 178,000 yuan. It is scheduled to open by the end of this year. If this is successful, it will have a significant impact on cotton exports in North China. Xingzhong is also actively acquiring a certain refined salt company in Tanggu to establish the "Jidong Soda Company" under Xingzhong's Salt Industry Department, manufacturing chemical salt. Using local Changlu salt as raw material, there is no need to purchase Luyan salt for export or sign contracts. In addition to Xingzhong itself, the Oriental Development Company and Tokugawa Soda Company are also interested in helping to handle the matter. (June 19th)</p>
<h3>Li Zongren Visits Guangdong to Meet Soong</h3>
<p>To Discuss Reorganizing Guangxi's Finances; Several Cordial Meetings</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Soong Tzu-wen arrived in Guangdong and announced that Guangdong Province would adopt the silver dollar system, he has gone to Hong Kong to discuss with financial circles the future reorganization of the finances of Guangdong and Guangxi. At the same time, he has also discussed the reorganization of Guangxi's finances with the Guangxi authorities. Because the Guangxi authorities are also earnestly engaged in reorganizing their finances, they have repeatedly telegraphed Soong, requesting him to visit Guangxi in person to inspect the financial situation of Guangxi Province in order to plan thoroughly. However, because Soong was unable to visit Guangxi, the Guangxi authorities sent Sun Zhi, chief of staff of the Fifth Army, to Guangzhou by plane, carrying a personal letter from Li Bai to Soong. Soong initially felt that visiting Guangxi would be difficult to achieve and had to meet with Li Zongren in Guangzhou. Because Li agreed to come to Guangzhou in person, he requested Yu Hanmou, director of the Guangdong Pacification Headquarters, to send a Douglas-type Guangdong aircraft to Guilin on the 25th to pick up Li. Li took the Guangdong aircraft, and the aircraft stayed in Guilin overnight. On the 26th, after discussing with Bai Chongxi, he, along with Guangxi Finance Director Huang Zhongyue, Fifth Route Army Senior Staff Officer Lin Sixi, and six other attendants, took off from Guilin Airport at 9:40 am on the 26th and arrived at Guangzhou Tianhe Airport at 12:30 pm without stopping along the way. The local authorities received a telegram in advance and sent military police to prepare at the airport. Soong Tzu-wen, Yu Hanmou, Wu Tiecheng, Xiang Hanping, Liu Jianjun, and other provincial and municipal officials, totaling more than 30 people, gathered at the airport to welcome Li. After Li got off the plane, he exchanged brief greetings with Soong, Yu, Wu, etc. Soong, Yu, Wu, etc. accompanied Li to the Municipal Guest House for a rest. Shortly afterward, a luncheon was held to welcome him, and the heads of various local agencies, military and political officials, attended. In the evening, Yu Hanmou, Xiang Hanping, Wu Tiecheng, etc., also held a banquet to welcome Li, and Soong Tzu-wen, Huang Zhongyue, etc., also participated. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until about 8:00 pm. According to Li, "This trip is to discuss with Mr. Soong Tzu-wen how to maintain Guangxi's finances and improve the currency system. I will stay for three or four days and then return to Guangxi. After the Guangxi army is reduced, only two divisions will remain to handle pacification affairs, and the remaining troops have been transformed into engineering corps, responsible for road construction and reclamation work. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai recently left Guilin to inspect the reclamation areas in Wuzhou and Yulin and to inspect the road construction projects of the engineering corps." It is said that after the luncheon on the 26th, Li and Soong Tzu-wen held oral consultations on the reorganization of Guangxi's finances on the second floor of the Guest House. On the morning of the 27th, Li was still receiving guests at the Guest House. At noon, Li and Huang Zhongyue drove to Meihua Village to return the visit to Yu Hanmou, Wu Tiecheng, Xiang Hanping, etc., and visited Luo Zhuoying, acting chief of staff of the Guangzhou Headquarters, briefly discussing the Guangxi army's reduction process and the current situation of the Fifth Army. At 5:00 pm, Soong Tzu-wen hosted a banquet for Li on the seventh floor of the New Embankment Central Bank Branch. After the banquet, they discussed the reorganization of Guangxi's finances and currency system again. One side proposed that the central government redeem Guangxi currency at a ratio of 1:6, and the other side proposed that Guangxi Province first hand over tax revenue to the central government for management and have a guarantee before issuing public bonds (20 million) to maintain finances and promote national currency in Guangxi Province. The key points lie in the above two items. At that time, Soong expressed the hope that Guangxi would first guarantee the actual number of Guangxi paper currency issued, the amount of reserves, and the details of revenue and expenditure, military expenditure, and prepare a detailed report so that he could take it to the capital and plan a reply with the relevant authorities for implementation and reorganization. On the afternoon of the 28th, Ji visited Zou Lu, president of Zhongshan University, who hosted a luncheon at the school, and they had a pleasant conversation. In the afternoon, Soong Tzu-wen went to the Guest House and discussed Guangxi's financial problems with Li again. Li prepared a report on the current financial situation in Guangxi and handed it over to Soong for planning. By then, the negotiations between the two sides had been largely completed. In the evening, Luo Zhuoying hosted a banquet for Li, and Soong and others attended. Li said that his mission for this trip was completed, and he planned to fly back to Guangxi on the 29th.

<h3>Qingdao Flour Prices Rise</h3>
<p>A Certain National Buying up Wheat, Social Bureau Seeks Relief Measures</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Flour prices in the city have been rising since last winter and have not fallen to this day. Although new wheat has been put on the market, flour prices have not only not fallen, but are also rising day by day. Two weeks ago, the price was around four yuan per bag, but now it has risen to more than four yuan and forty-seven cents, which is three or four jiao more than the price in Shanghai. This has become a serious problem.</p>
<p>The direct reason for the rise in flour prices is the soaring price of wheat. According to national statistics, this year's wheat harvest is more than 35% lower than last year. Gaomi County, the city's source of wheat, harvests an average of about 30,000 tons each year, but this year it only harvested about 70%, or more than 20,000 tons. Also, Jinan has reported a wheat shortage, and most of Gaomi wheat has been transported to Jinan, so the city is feeling a shortage of wheat. This is one of the reasons for the recent rise in flour prices. Also, our country's production is backward, and the wheat produced in this province is not enough for the province's use, so it is necessary to rely on foreign wheat for supply. Recently, the price of wheat in the United States and Canada has also risen, and the value of each 100 jin transported to the city is about 10 yuan. This is the second reason for the rise in flour prices. Since our country reformed the currency system, because the people in the countryside are used to it, they are unwilling to accept paper money, so most of them hoard and do not sell. In addition, a certain flour mill operated by people from a certain country in the city is unwilling to buy in reality, but buys in reality as soon as it sees wheat. A small number of unscrupulous merchants are also manipulating from it, causing the price of wheat in the city to skyrocket. This is another reason for the rise in flour prices. The Social Bureau has recently taken measures to seek relief and stabilize people's minds. In addition to dispatching a number of employees from the agricultural and industrial plants to thoroughly investigate the reasons for the price increase, it has also prepared appropriate remedial measures, signed and submitted them to the mayor for approval, and after approval, it will follow the guidance and strive to prevent the outflow of wheat and stabilize flour prices.</p>
<h3>Bengbu Wheat Prices Soar</h3>
<p>The Reason is a General Poor Harvest in Northern Anhui; Flour, Soybeans, etc. Rise in Price Together</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Since last autumn, grain prices in the city have been rising without falling, which has never happened in previous years. The living standards of the people have increased accordingly. The people who could barely make a living in the past are now stretched and unable to maintain themselves. It was hoped that the wheat season would be plentiful and grain prices would decrease, so as to alleviate the hardship slightly. However, the facts are exactly the opposite. The reason is that this year, when the wheat in the northern part of Anhui Province was ripe, it was suddenly attacked by strong winds and heavy rains. The ears of wheat were sparse, and the harvest only accounted for 50%, which was half as much as last year. Since the wheat harvest was generally poor, the price still rose after it was put on the market, and there was no sign of decreasing. Until the recent two or three days, wheat prices have soared, such as Taizhou's top-grade old wheat, which has risen to 20 yuan per stone, new wheat is 18 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, and Dahewan's flower wheat is 16-17 yuan per stone. The price is high, breaking the previous record. Flour related to wheat has risen to 4 yuan 4 jiao per bag, and Yingzhou soybeans have risen to 16 yuan 6 jiao per stone, which is also unprecedented. There are three reasons for the soaring grain prices. ㊀ The harvest in northern Anhui has decreased, and farmers are deeply afraid of developing into a famine year. They would rather hoard and wait and see than lightly transport and sell. ㊁ The source is scarce, and the supply does not meet the demand. Good wheat is especially lacking. ㊂ Inferior goods flood the market, and flour mills and grain merchants are not happy to receive and trade because it is too uneconomical to purchase. With these three factors, the grain market has presented a tired situation. On the 29th, only more than 2,800 stones of wheat and more than 6,000 stones of soybeans were traded in the entire port. According to people in the grain industry, recently, because grain prices are so high, buyers are all watching and waiting. The price has risen to the point where it cannot rise, and it will soon fall back. Once the price is reduced, the grain market will have the hope of being active. (June 30th)</p>
<h3>Severe Flooding in Various Counties of Northern Fujian</h3>
<p>Corpses Float Downstream to Fuzhou - People of Minhou Discuss Water Conservancy</p>

<p>Text:</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The upper reaches of the Min River have experienced continuous rainfall since the end of May. In just one month, there have been six floods, each worse than the last. The sixth flood, which occurred on the 26th, 27th, and 28th days of the month, was particularly devastating. The Ministry of Railways had purchased ten thousand railway sleepers in northern Fujian, and timber merchants from Tianjin and Zhejiang had purchased over ten thousand pieces of fir wood, totaling over twenty thousand pieces. These were formed into over ten thousand rafts and released (commonly known as "rafting") from Dongxi in Jian'ou and Xixi in Shaxian, flowing downstream along the river through Yanping to Taijiang in Fuzhou. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 26th, the river surged dramatically. All the rafts were washed ashore. Due to the force of the flood, they crashed and collided, severely damaging houses, fields, and roads and bridges in the counties along the banks, including Jian'ou, Shunchang, Nanping, Gutian, Minqing, and Minhou. Except for a portion that sank into the water, people and belongings were carried away by the flood. Residents near the water in Hongtang outside the west gate of Fuzhou and Taijiang outside the south gate scrambled to retrieve floating objects, and obtained a great deal. One family was retrieving items at their doorstep when, unexpectedly, a corpse floated into their courtyard. Another family found a wooden box, opened it, and discovered two children inside, already lifeless. Each day, several floating corpses have been found in the rivers inside and outside the city, and were collected and buried by burial societies. In recent days, the Provincial Relief Association has received over ten reports from various counties requesting urgent disaster relief. As for the poor people in the flooded areas of the provincial capital, the police bureau has established eight shelters in various theaters and temples, each housing around a thousand people, and various charitable organizations are jointly providing thin congee for relief. These shelters were disbanded when the water receded completely on the evening of the 28th. In the southwestern villages, fields have been flooded six times, resulting in a complete loss of the early rice harvest. Yesterday, the provincial government ordered the provincial bank to allocate 30,000 yuan for the Minhou County government to purchase late rice seeds, which will be distributed to farmers in various areas for urgent sowing, to provide some relief. The farmers will repay the funds in installments when the late rice is harvested.</p>
<p>People from the first, second, third, and fourth districts of Minhou County believe that frequent floods are a serious matter concerning people's livelihoods. Therefore, on the 28th, they convened a water conservancy discussion meeting at the first district office in Baihuting, gathering enthusiastic people from various districts and chiefs of protected townships and counties that were affected by the floods. They resolved on six water conservancy construction measures to be submitted by each district to the county government and then forwarded to the provincial government for swift implementation. The measures are as follows: ㊀ The flow of sand in Nangang is filling the riverbed, making it too high. Dredging should be urgently planned to prevent overflow and disasters. ㊁ The Longkou area is a vital transportation artery for the southwest port. In recent years, the river mouth has been filling up. Dredging should be carried out urgently to prevent the floodwaters from breaching Fuzhou. ㊂ The waterway of the West River is becoming narrower day by day. When floods arrive, they inundate the entire city. Measures should be taken to guide and channel the water flow. ㊃ The Wanshou Bridge in Taijiang originally had thirty-six arches, but now only twenty-eight remain, making it difficult for floodwaters to flow smoothly. Every time there is a flood, the water rises rapidly, causing accumulation and blockage. The construction, which already plans to convert the Jiangnan Bridge into an iron bridge, is indeed necessary. It should be urged to be realized as soon as possible. ㊄ The Fuwan Road from Hongjiang to the south bank of Taijiang is too high, obstructing the flow. More culverts should be requested to facilitate drainage. ㊅ There are many rocks on both sides of the Xiangan and Xiaobei mountains at the mouth of the West River where it enters the sea, making the port narrow. It should be requested to widen them together to smooth the river flow. (June 30th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Education Director's Transfer Causes Uproar – All Sectors Cable for Rescission and Directly Reject New Appointee</h3>
<p>—Refusing New Official From Assuming Duty in Songjiang—</p>
<p>Songjiang Communication: The provincial government, after a meeting on the 22nd, ordered the transfer of Chen Guisang, the Director of the Songjiang Education Bureau, to Taihui, and appointed Xiong Zhugao to succeed him. Upon hearing this news, local gentry and the education sector believed that since Director Chen's appointment, he had spared no effort in reorganizing local education. However, the newly appointed Xiong had been found to have committed numerous misdeeds during his tenure in Qingpu and Jiangyin, and was driven out by the people. If he were to take charge of education in Songjiang, the future of Songjiang's education would be greatly jeopardized. Public sentiment was indignant, and the gentry, including Min Huan and Zhang Yunhe, cabled the provincial government and the Department of Education, requesting the rescission of the appointment. They also cabled various fellow-provincial associations in Beijing and Shanghai, expressing their unanimous opposition. Furthermore, leaders from various sectors directly sent letters to Xiong, refusing his arrival in Songjiang. The original cables from the Yunwen Fellow-Provincial Association in Beijing and the New Songjiang Society, along with ten other organizations rejecting Xiong, are recorded below: ㊀ "To Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and Director Zhou Jun of the Department of Education: Songjiang's education has achieved considerable success over the past thirty years, mainly because local individuals are in charge and are most suitable for managing academic property, especially in maintaining it thoroughly and making appropriate adjustments. According to cables from Min Huan, Zhang Yunhe, and others in Songjiang, the sudden appointment of an outsider to the Education Bureau is highly inappropriate. Moreover, as the Party-state tutelage is coming to an end and constitutional governance is beginning, and local autonomy will eventually involve the popular election of county magistrates, there is no need to avoid appointing locals to the Education Bureau. We respectfully request that you relay this to the provincial government and the Department of Education to rescind the appointment and maintain the status quo, which would be fortunate for the region. With respect, Shen Li, Huang Yunzhen, and Cai Guanghui, Standing Directors of the Yunjian Fellow-Provincial Association in Beijing." ㊁ "To Mr. Xiong Zhugao of the Zhenjiang Department of Education: We have heard that you have been appointed as the Director of the Songjiang Education Bureau, and the elders of the entire county are extremely surprised. They all believe that Songjiang's education, from the late Qing Dynasty to the present, has always been managed by local people, which has led to today's achievements. If an outsider were to take over, there are fears that misunderstandings would arise. Letters and telegrams have been circulating in recent days, and public sentiment is surging. We, and other organizations, have assessed the situation and dare to advise Mr. Xiong to politely decline the appointment in order to comply with public sentiment. With utmost sincerity, The New Songjiang Society Board of Directors."</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Request to Postpone Road Widening</p>
<p>The road surface construction of the north-south trunk road being widened in the urban area is currently underway and will be completed by the middle of next month. The east-west trunk road will then be continuously constructed. Currently, businesses along the route believe that the ninth and tenth months are the peak season for commerce, and they rely on this for their annual income. If the streets are widened, houses demolished and rebuilt, and the road surface is constructed, it will inevitably be delayed for four or five months, resulting in significant losses for the merchants. Following a request from the industry, the county chamber of commerce has written to the county government requesting a postponement until next spring. At the same time, regarding the delay in the north-south trunk road project, which has lasted for five or six months, causing traffic obstruction and harming the merchants' business, they request that the contracting company be supervised to complete the project within a limited time.</p>

<h3>Gu Zhutong, Deputy Director of the Military Reorganization Council of Sichuan and Xikang, Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Proceed to Nanjing and Lushan to Meet Chiang Kai-shek – Chiang and He Yingqin Will Go to Sichuan to Assume New Posts</p>
<p>Gu Zhutong, Director of the Xi'an Provisional Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission, traveled from southern Shaanxi to Lushan to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, report on the recent situation in the Northwest, and make some requests. He recently arrived in Nanjing to meet with Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin. Gu has been newly appointed as Deputy Director of the Military Reorganization Council of Sichuan and Xikang. After discussing matters with Director He Yingqin, Gu traveled to Shanghai to handle personal affairs. He left Nanjing with his wife and adjutant by the 11:00 pm express train the night before, arriving in Shanghai at 7:00 am yesterday. Because few people knew in advance, no one was able to welcome him. After getting off the train at the North Station, he went straight to his private residence on Shanzhong Road to rest. It is reported that He Yingqin is scheduled to go to Lushan from Nanjing today to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for instructions.

<h3>Powell Returns to Shanghai and Shares His Impressions of Eastern Hebei</h3>
<p>One Advisor Assigned to Each County – Massive Investment from Japanese Financial Circles</p>
<p>J.B. Powell, editor of the China Weekly Review, recently returned to Shanghai after inspecting Tongzhou and other places in North China. Yesterday, he gave a speech on the puppet Manchuria and Eastern Hebei issue at the Shanghai YMCA. Excerpts from his speech are recorded below: Powell said, "Currently, Japan is actively expanding the puppet organization in Eastern Hebei. This action is undoubtedly a definite move by Japan to shift the puppet Manchuria's power southward. Eastern Hebei's position is extremely important, and it is rich in resources. It is indeed a part of puppet Manchuria. Currently, there is one Japanese advisor in each county. In addition, there are already about 20,000 troops, and it is rumored that there are plans to increase them to 30,000. Regarding the cotton planting issue, the Japanese are indeed continuing to oppress farmers and carry out large-scale cotton planting work for the Osaka Japanese Textile Mill. All industrial institutions are branches of puppet Manchuria. Currently, with the protection of the Kwantung Army, the Japanese business community has begun to invest heavily in Eastern Hebei."</p>
<h3>Biscuit Industry and Others Request Thorough Investigation of Flour Speculation</h3>
<p>Organized Control – Telegraphing for Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>After the disturbance over cloth subsided, flour transactions are also being manipulated by someone. The market price has soared to the point of suspension. Yesterday, the Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Industry and three other groups telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry, requesting the correction of speculation and an immediate thorough investigation. The original telegram said, (titles omitted) "Since the beginning of this month, the flour and wheat market has been manipulated by speculators, causing the market price to exceed the norm. In the past, the market price has never risen so sharply when new wheat is on the market. Today, it is more than one yuan higher per bag than in previous years. The usual state of expensive rice and cheap flour has also been broken. This situation is entirely caused by organized, large-scale control by speculators. Discerning people can clearly see that if this continues, the market will be controlled by them, prices will lose their balance, people's livelihood will be affected, and there are concerns about food shortages. The stakes are high, and the situation is serious. Our association's entire product line relies on flour and wheat as the main raw materials. Due to the soaring prices, it is difficult to maintain capital, and we are directly and greatly harmed. We are currently losing money and are about to be forced to cease operations, which will bring an end to the livelihoods of more than a thousand businesses in the city. The situation is urgent.

<h3>Zhou Qigang Talks About the Purpose of Inspecting Overseas Chinese Affairs in Fujian and Guangdong</h3>
<p>Management of Overseas Chinese Affairs Agencies Urgently Needs Improvement – Departing by Ship on the 3rd and Returning North in One Month</p>
<p>In order to effectively improve the management of overseas Chinese affairs in various parts of southern China, the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has sent Vice Chairman Zhou Qigang to inspect Fujian and Guangdong provinces and Hong Kong. Zhou, along with his wife and secretary, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the day before yesterday and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. They are scheduled to depart on the Hai Zhen ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the 3rd and return north in one month.</p>
<p>Purpose of the Inspection</p>
<p>A reporter interviewed and inquired about the purpose of the inspection yesterday morning. Zhou said that the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has been establishing Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureaus in Fujian and Guangdong provinces to manage the affairs of returned and outbound overseas Chinese in various parts of southern China for half a year. Due to the repeated start-ups, there are no achievements to speak of. However, statistics show that the number of overseas Chinese entering and leaving Fujian Province reaches about 10,000 per month, so the management work must be strict and proper to prevent overseas Chinese from being impoverished or displaced when they go abroad, and to prevent overseas Chinese from feeling alienated from their homeland when they return due to being away for a long time. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, in light of this, has specially sent me to inspect in order to improve the situation. The inspection areas are stipulated to be You Tou, Xiamen, Haikou, Jiangmen, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. Except for Hong Kong, there are Overseas Chinese Affairs agencies established in all places. In the future, it is also planned to establish one in Hong Kong, because it is adjacent to Guangdong Province and is a necessary port for going to Southeast Asia, which is very necessary for managing overseas Chinese affairs. It is scheduled to return north in one month. If time permits, Fuzhou and Macau will also be visited. The rumor that he will go to Southeast Asia via Guangdong and Hong Kong for inspection is a misrepresentation.</p>
<p>Key Points to Note</p>
<p>Zhou continued, "The people of our country have been seeking a livelihood overseas for a long time. Because we have not paid attention to it for thousands of years, the more than 10 million overseas Chinese have suffered from the harsh examples and abuses of local governments. However, based on the facts, this is all caused by the negligence of overseas Chinese affairs management. Therefore, wherever overseas Chinese are concentrated, it is necessary to pay attention to the detailed situation of the locality, such as the recent need for 6,000 Chinese workers in Singapore. The number of overseas Chinese going there from China must not exceed the limit, otherwise they will be restricted from entering the country. Currently, European countries pay special attention to their colonies, so Chinese people should pay close attention to the migration of overseas Chinese to European regions to avoid a situation where there are too many people and no work to be found, or too few people and their positions are taken by others. The average number of overseas Chinese is very important, and the smuggling of overseas Chinese out of domestic ports must be strictly prohibited."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Children's Disaster Relief Donations Entirely Used for Disaster-Stricken Children</h3>
<p>Letter from the Children's Welfare Association to the Shanghai Children's Welfare Society</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Children's Welfare Association previously noted the severe drought in provinces such as Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Henan, and the particularly dire situation of the affected children. In April, it drafted a plan for national children's relief for children in disaster areas and requested the Shanghai Municipal Children's Welfare Undertakings Committee to promote a donation campaign in local primary and middle schools to aid disaster relief. Subsequently, the Children's Welfare Society replied favorably and submitted it to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. From June 1st to 30th, a major donation campaign was implemented among school children in Shanghai. It stipulated that each primary school child should save one copper coin a day from their candy money, totaling three dimes a month. Each higher primary school child should save one and a half copper coins a day from their candy money, totaling forty-five cents a month. Each middle school child should save two copper coins a day from their allowance, totaling ninety cents a month. By accumulating small amounts, a large sum of money could be raised for disaster relief. Since the Social Affairs Bureau promulgated and implemented the donation campaign, it has progressed very smoothly, demonstrating the Shanghai children's enthusiasm for disaster relief. The Chinese Children's Welfare Association recently announced that the donation campaign ended on June 30th. Relief efforts for disaster-stricken children in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Henan are already being actively promoted. Mr. Chen Tiesheng has repeatedly sent telegrams urging the need for funds. Therefore, yesterday, the association specifically sent Liu Wenlin, a staff member of the relief group, to visit Zhang Binghui, Chairman of the Children's Welfare Society, with a letter requesting a review of the original proposal. After the donations from each school are collected, the entire amount will be handed over to the society for use in disaster relief for children in the disaster areas. It is reported that Mr. Zhang solemnly stated that all disaster relief donations from Shanghai children will be used to aid disaster-stricken children, thereby completing the good deeds of Shanghai's children for children.</p>

<h3>Municipal Federation Again Writes to Municipal Council Urging Strict Austerity to Avoid Additional Levies</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation is paying close attention to the Municipal Council's proposal to increase the municipal general levy. In addition to already writing to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to urge the council to implement strict austerity measures so that the additional levy for next year becomes unnecessary, it is again writing to the Municipal Council to urge them, as the matter concerns increasing the burden on taxpayers and brooks no delay. The original letter states, "To the Esteemed Sirs, Regarding the matter of increasing the municipal general levy, this federation has repeatedly written to your council to request the cancellation of the proposal, as taxpayers cannot bear the burden. Subsequently, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association held a representative conference on April 12th, which resolved that 'Regarding the Public Concession Municipal Council's proposal to increase the levy from July 1st of the 26th year of the Republic, it should be deferred to the next year for further deliberation, and the Municipal Council should be instructed to earnestly reduce unnecessary expenditures and collect arrears within this year to achieve rationality.' However, at the foreign ratepayers' meeting on the 14th of the same month, it was resolved that it should be 'extended to be implemented from January of next year.' It is a well-known fact that commerce and industry in this city have been declining in recent years, and the market is depressed. Although a turning point is currently seen, the vitality has been severely depleted and is difficult to restore in the short term. Therefore, the proposal for an additional levy should not exist in the first place. Your council should comply with the resolution of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, earnestly reduce unnecessary expenditures, and collect arrears to first seek financial rationality. It is hoped that you will consider and handle this accordingly."</p>

<h3>Disaster Relief News</h3>
<p>Reports from Various Counties in Sichuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Sichuan Disaster Relief Association yesterday continued to receive reports of disaster conditions from counties in Sichuan, such as Wusheng, stating, "Heaven is unkind. Since March of last year, there has been drought after drought. After the summer drought, there was the autumn drought, and after the autumn drought, there was the winter drought, resulting in cracked fields and desolate land. The red soil stretches for thousands of miles, a heartbreaking sight never before seen. Starving people fill the fields, and death lines the roads. The bark of trees has been stripped bare, and there is nothing left of grass and trees. The only thing that people rely on to fill their stomachs each day is mud. Moreover, drinking water is difficult. Rivers and lakes have been dry for a long time. Some have to travel ten miles to find water but cannot. Some have sacrificed their lives due to disputes over water. All kinds of tragedies are unprecedented in Sichuan. The situation has worsened in the past month. Orphans, widows, and the elderly and infirm are left to cry to the heavens and sit and wait for death. The cunning and strong gather in groups of hundreds, carrying spears and hoes, robbing food everywhere, looting homes, leaving no chickens or dogs, and emptying cattle and sheep pens. The situation is turbulent and worrying. If relief is not provided urgently and a fundamental solution is not devised, even if a large amount of relief funds is issued in the future, it is feared that it will be difficult to feed the mouths of the starving people, and the disaster of the late Ming Dynasty will be repeated. It is hoped that fellow countrymen and gentlemen, with hearts of benevolence and love for the people, will open their purses to donate and save those in dire straits and rescue them from their misery. They will be eternally grateful." In addition, the association received a report from Longchang County that disaster victims are forced by hunger to become bandits, boldly looting in various towns where garrison troops are stationed, which shows the general severity of the Sichuan disaster.</p>
<p>Report from the Red Swastika Society</p>

In Wanxian, Chairmen Ma Weizan and Zhu Wuci presided over the efforts, while in Zhongxian, Chairman Lan Ningji of the Wuxi Branch Association assisted the relief team in investigating and distributing aid. The relief funds for each county were set at 20,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Should Obtain Customs Duty Certificates</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified the six industry associations of hardware, iron, copper-tin, steel bars, scrap iron, thermos bottle manufacturing, and tin printing and can making, stating, "We are writing to you because we received a letter from the Tin Printing and Can Making Industry Association reporting that a large amount of tinplate is being sold in the market recently, which is reportedly smuggled goods. Please find a way to prevent it.' After the chamber convened representatives of the relevant industry associations to discuss the matter, it was decided to notify all industries that in the future, when purchasing tinplate, they must obtain customs import duty certificates (i.e., the Shanghai Si). If there is only one certificate, the selling company should be requested to ask the customs to make a copy of the certificate for safekeeping,' etc. This has been recorded and notified to you accordingly. It is hoped that you will investigate and handle this accordingly."</p>

According to silk industry sources yesterday, the price of improved dried cocoons has recently reached 200 to 220 yuan per dan, and native varieties also require 150 to 160 yuan. Although silk prices have risen sharply, selling for 840 yuan per dan, the cost still results in losses. Moreover, the stock of cocoons in Shanghai, based on current needs, only provides for two months of use. Therefore, the future of the silk industry remains bleak.</p>
<h3>Two Letters from the China Merchants' Bureau</h3>
<p>Concerning the Qualification of Marine Engineers – The Mutual Collision Case of "Xinjiang Tian" and "Ningxing" – Reply to the Merchant Marine Alumni Association</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Alumni Association of the Wusong Merchant Marine School sent a letter to the state-run China Merchants' Bureau, raising objections to the Bureau's announcement to its affiliated marine engineers regarding the experience of marine engineers. The original letter has already been published in the newspapers. It is now learned that the China Merchants' Bureau has prepared a letter in reply to the Association. The text is recorded below:</p>
<p>To the esteemed members of the Association,</p>
<p>We have received your letter, from which we have learned everything. The points you raised are not without misunderstanding, and we hereby make a special clarification. In the statement by this Bureau to its affiliated marine engineers, the phrase "those who come from schools" indeed have good academic knowledge, but they focus on theory and lack experience. Moreover, due to their unfamiliarity with practical operations, they are unable to personally handle matters, which can also affect work efficiency. This does not refer to graduates of any specific school, nor does it refer to graduates of your esteemed school. It is only a general statement, and it refers only to a small number within the general population. If the marine engineers of your Association do not have this shortcoming and are indeed as your letter states, then it has nothing to do with the reputation of your Association. Knowing this, you should reassure and encourage yourselves and not worry excessively. Moreover, familiarity with practical operations varies with individual constitution, and the achievement of skills also varies with individual aptitude. Even within the same school and class, the evaluation of grades is still divided into A and B. Can your Association guarantee that there is absolutely no one among its members with this shortcoming? Furthermore, those who come from schools often focus on theory and lack experience, and are unwilling to personally handle matters. This is a widespread phenomenon in our country, and it is not unique to marine engineers. Those who can appreciate the state's utmost intention in nurturing talent should especially make up for deficiencies, correct shortcomings, and strive for improvement so that they can advance in scholarship and career.</p>
<p>We offer this sincere reply, hoping for your understanding.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Cai Zengji</p>
<p>To the Alumni Association of the Wusong Merchant Marine School, Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>Reply to the Ningbo Native Place Association</p>
<p>The Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai sent separate letters to the Sanbei Steamboat Company and the state-run China Merchants' Bureau regarding the mutual collision case of the "Xinjiang Tian" and "Ningxing" vessels, in which they raised some questions. It is now learned that the state-run China Merchants' Bureau sent a letter of reply to the Ningbo Native Place Association yesterday, expressing its handling of the case. The original text of the letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>We have received your letter, stating that the newspapers reported a collision between "Xinjiang Tian" and "Ningxing" on the morning of the 23rd of last month in the Zhenhai estuary due to racing to be first. You are deeply concerned about the impact of this incident on the safety of navigation and travel. From the standpoint of a native place organization, you cannot remain silent on this unfortunate event and urge us to investigate and strictly order all captains of our vessels to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future to ensure the safety of passengers. The collision between "Xinjiang Tian" and "Ningxing" is already under strict investigation by the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau. As you have indicated, whether the two vessels collided due to racing to be first remains to be investigated. The speed of navigation varies, and whether the waterway at that location only allows one vessel to pass or has restrictions needs to be confirmed to ascertain the truth. This Bureau believes that before the truth is clarified, it is not possible to immediately determine the cause of this incident. This Bureau has always attached great importance to the safety of navigation and passengers, and strict regulations have been established and circulated for strict compliance.</p>
<p>In accordance with the aforementioned letter, this Bureau, in addition to expressing admiration for your Association's concern for the safety of navigation and travel and its maintenance of the homeland, hereby sends a corresponding reply and attaches a copy of the submission from the entire crew of the "Xinjiang Tian" for your review.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The State-Run China Merchants' Bureau</p>
<p>To the Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Tax Bureau and Police Bureau Negotiate Collection of Income Tax from Russian Émigrés</h3>
<p>Measures Published in "Chila" Russian Newspaper</p>
<p>The Shanghai Income Tax Office and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, in order to facilitate and supervise the declaration and payment of income tax by Russian émigrés, have specially negotiated the following measures:</p>
<p>(1) The Shanghai Income Tax Office will appoint a special investigator, Bao Xu, to be stationed at the Russian Émigré Public Joint Association. Russian émigrés who are unclear about the procedures for declaring and paying income tax and the relevant laws and regulations can request answers and guidance from him nearby.</p>
<p>(2) Starting yesterday, Russian émigrés applying to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for registration or the issuance of licenses must first apply to the Shanghai Income Tax Office for a certificate proving that they have complied with the declaration and payment of income tax.</p>
<p>(3) The aforementioned measures have been jointly announced by the bureau, office, and association, translated into Russian, and published in the "Chila" (transliteration) Russian newspaper.</p>
<h3>All Parties Seriously Implementing the Movement Against Buying and Selling Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>Zhu Qun, Chen Xingen, Le Xiukang, Yang Weixin, Zhu Ping, Le Xiucheng, and other students from Sanwei Elementary School in Zhabei sent a letter to the Shanghai Anti-Smuggling Movement Committee yesterday, suggesting four points:</p>
<p>(1) The movement against buying and selling smuggled goods should be united with customs officers. Smuggled goods should certainly not be bought or sold, but preventing their import is also a very important matter.</p>
<p>(2) How can citizens recognize smuggled goods? Many citizens, especially women, still have a weak understanding of smuggled goods, so they often fall for unscrupulous merchants and buy smuggled goods as domestic products. When promoting the movement against buying and selling smuggled goods, we cannot neglect the knowledge of how to recognize smuggled goods.</p>
<p>(3) We request the government to arm anti-smuggling personnel and organize civilian anti-smuggling teams to help customs officers combat smuggling.</p>
<p>(4) Hold a lantern parade to expand the publicity campaign, because we feel that the scope of the publicity meeting on the 27th was too small. Only two or three thousand people were able to see it. We should hold an "Anti-Smuggling Lantern Parade" so that tens of millions of people can have a deep impression and effect.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the 15th and 36th district branches of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association convened a joint meeting of all member stores on North Shanxi Road and Tiantong Road. The first item discussed was the proposal that all member stores on the roads under the jurisdiction of the association should swear not to buy or sell smuggled goods. It was resolved that: (A) all members present at the meeting should fill out forms and swear; (B) members who did not attend the meeting should be held separately at a later date.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Sends Another Letter to the Public Works Department to Change the Light Bicycle Fee</h3>
<p>A Reasonable Proposal for Citizens Should Be Given a Frank Explanation and Analysis</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously sent a letter to the Public Works Department regarding the matter of reducing the bicycle license fee. The Bicycle Manufacturing Association believes that the Public Works Department's explanation of the change in bicycle license fee collection rates is inappropriate and unreasonable, and listed six reasons for transmission. The Public Works Department replied that the Bureau has carefully considered the points raised, but is unwilling to change the already decided plan. The Chamber of Commerce sent another letter to the Public Works Department, stating that the Chamber finds it difficult to agree with your letter. Although the policy of taxation implemented by your Bureau is within your Bureau's authority to change or not, your Bureau should also give a frank explanation and analysis to the reasonable objections of citizens. If you only refuse without giving reasons, then it seems that the era of such powerful politics has passed, which is by no means what Chinese citizens residing in the Settlement expect from your Bureau. Please explain in detail why the industry's request cannot be agreed to by your Bureau, otherwise, the Chamber has no words to reply to its members.</p>
<h3>Municipal Crematorium to Be Completed in October</h3>
<p>Location Already Determined at Gaojing Temple in Jiangwan – Half of the 60,000 Yuan in Funding Has Been Raised</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Crematorium, since its planning, is being actively planned by the Municipal Health Bureau. The location has been determined to be south of the First Public Cemetery in Gaojing Temple, Jiangwan. It is expected to be completed and put into use in October. Various charitable organizations and native place associations have expressed their support. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Location Determined</p>
<p>After receiving the order from Chairman Chiang to stipulate public burial grounds, the Shanghai Municipal Government, recognizing that Shanghai has a large population and limited land, and that it is necessary to build a crematorium, ordered the Municipal Health Bureau, Land Administration Bureau, and Police Bureau to jointly organize a construction committee with charitable organizations, villas, public offices, and native place associations to plan everything. The construction site has been determined by the Health Bureau to be south of the First Public Cemetery in Gaojing Temple, Jiangwan, covering an area of about 20 mu. The style adopts the Chinese architectural style, with an estimated cost of 60,000 yuan. The Municipal Government plans to contribute 20,000 yuan, Wu Liande pledged 10,000 yuan, and the remaining 30,000 yuan will be pledged by various charitable organizations, native place associations, and public offices.</p>
<p>Letter Urging Donations</p>
<p>Yesterday, the construction committee sent a letter to various organizations, stating that in order to establish the Shanghai Municipal Crematorium, it invited various charitable organizations, public offices, villas, guilds, and native place associations to participate in the construction. They strongly supported and generously pledged donations and instructed the committee to send another letter to determine the amount of donations. A letter has been sent, but your association has not yet replied. We are sending another letter to request your support and promptly notify the Municipal Central District Health Bureau of the amount of construction funds to be donated so that personnel can be sent to collect them. The construction situation and the list of organizations that have pledged donations are attached for your review. We respectfully request your generous donation so that the project can be completed.</p>
<p>Support from All Parties</p>
<p>Various charitable organizations, native place associations, guilds, and villas have expressed their support for this measure. According to the persons in charge of various organizations, Shanghai has limited land and a large population, and there are many coffins. According to the statistics of the Health Bureau in the eighteenth year of the Republic, there are more than 100,000 coffins. Various charitable organizations and villas feel that there is little land and many coffins, making it difficult to clean up. If no measures are taken, the situation will inevitably become more difficult. Moreover, cremation is a clean burial method that has long been adopted by Buddhism. Therefore, from the perspectives of economy, humanity, hygiene, city appearance, society, the public, and public needs, promoting cremation is indeed beneficial.</p>
<h3>Three People Die Tragically</h3>
<p>Swallowing Opium...Car Collision...Electrocution</p>
<p>Tian Zhenyuan, 39, from Shaoxing, the owner of the Railway Inn in Gaoshou Lane, North Boundary Road, has been suffering from severe mental illness recently. After failing to recover from medical treatment and suffering extreme pain, he harbored the thought of ending his life. He secretly swallowed opium and committed suicide. His younger brother, Tian Jiasheng, caught a glimpse of it and reported it to the Huizhong Concession Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. An ambulance was called to the scene, and he was sent to Tongren Hospital. The treatment was ineffective, and he died at 5:10 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Chen Yaolin, 21, from Shaoxing, was riding in a rickshaw at the intersection of Haibin Road and Shuanglun Road at 1:43 PM yesterday, heading east. As he was riding, a prisoner transport vehicle, No. 3305, driven by Zhang Bingming of the Huizhong Concession Police Station, sped from the east. Due to a failure to brake in time, the rickshaw was knocked down, and Chen was crushed by the left front wheel of the vehicle. He was seriously injured. The Hongkou Police Station was notified and dispatched an ambulance to send Chen to Tongren Hospital. The treatment was ineffective, and he died at 9:35 PM that evening.</p>
<p>Li Bochun, 21, from Taixing, a worker at the Guangzhong Dye Factory at 645 Kunming Road, was pushing a steel loading cart on the first floor of the factory with two other workers in the afternoon of the previous day. Due to carelessness, the front of the cart hit the motor wire next to it, causing the insulation of the wire to break. Because the cart was made of steel, the electricity passed very quickly. Because Li's hands were on the cart, he was immediately electrocuted and fell to the ground, suffering severe injuries. The other two people each had one hand on the cart handle, so although they were also electrocuted, their lives were not in danger. The factory reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, which sent detectives to send Li and the other two to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. Li died before arriving at the hospital. The other two are under treatment. The three bodies were taken to the Ferry Road morgue by the respective police stations for examination. Yesterday morning, Zhang, a prosecutor from the First Special District Local Court of Shanghai, was dispatched to the morgue to verify the identities of the bodies. He then ordered the respective family members to collect the bodies for burial.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Actually Wants to Interfere with Movie Theaters Showing Slogans</h3>
<p>Anti-Smuggling Association Will Protest</p>
<p>Recently, the Anti-Smuggling Movement Committee of all circles in Shanghai, in order to arouse the people of the country to unanimously promote the movement against buying and selling smuggled goods and save the national economy, held a publicity meeting and sent letters to the broadcasting industry and various movie theaters to cooperate in publicity. Some movie theaters made anti-smuggling slogans into slides and inserted them into the screenings to awaken the audience's attention. However, after hearing the news, the Public Works Department of the Public Concession sent personnel to investigate various radio stations and movie theaters and prohibit the screening of the publicity slides. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Zhu Yutao, the secretary of the association. According to him, the harm of smuggled goods is unbearable not only for China, but also for all those who have business relations in China. When the British Parliament holds meetings, parliamentarians' questions about the Datong incident often involve the issue of smuggled goods. Since the smuggling of goods into China, British trade in China has felt a severe threat. Other countries have also expressed their anger at this smuggling policy. Even legitimate Japanese merchants residing in our country have repeatedly asked the authorities to crack down on smuggling to maintain their business. It can be seen that the anti-smuggling movement is not only a manifestation of the patriotic heart of the people in China, but also the prevention of smuggling, the maintenance of tariffs, the protection of credit, and the restoration of normal trade in China for various countries are all beneficial to various countries. Now, the Public Works Department interferes rashly, not only showing cowardice, but also failing to understand the international significance of the anti-smuggling movement. Otherwise, it should not have done this. Moreover, the Rental Concession Office often interferes with the patriotic movements of the Chinese people, which is an insult to our national dignity. Therefore, we cannot take this matter lightly. After the association received reports from various movie theaters about the prohibition of screening, it decided to convene a full committee meeting within days to continue discussing publicity methods. At the same time, it will notify the Public Works Department of the significance of the anti-smuggling movement and ask it to revoke the unreasonable interference.</p>

<h3>Thief Caught Last Night in Aojia Road Robbery by Patrol Officer</h3>
<p>Maid Follows and Alerts Patrol Officer – Confiscated Live Ammunition Handgun</p>
<p>Five robbers broke into the home of a certain Mr. Zhou in Zhoujiacun (no house number), Aojia Road, Hongkou at 8:25 PM last night. Two of them were armed with handguns, and they threatened the men and women of the household to keep silent. As a result, they robbed 100 yuan in legal currency. The robbers left with the stolen goods. Unexpectedly, a maid in the house was unwilling to submit and secretly left through the back door, following behind them all the way to the patrol officer's post, where she reported the facts. After hearing the report, the patrol officer pursued them and blew his whistle loudly. The robbers, knowing that they had been exposed, fled in panic. One robber turned around and fired a shot at the patrol officer, who also fired a shot in return. Neither side hit the target. After chasing for about half a li, one of the robbers in the rear was unable to continue and was apprehended by the patrol officer. A live ammunition handgun was confiscated. He was taken to the Jiaxing Road Police Station for investigation. The remaining robbers escaped without a trace.</p>
<h3>Complete Construction of the Zhenru Buddhist Cemetery</h3>
<p>Since its construction, various projects of the Zhenru Buddhist First Cemetery have been gradually completed. According to news from the Preparatory Office yesterday, the entire project will be completed as soon as the road paving is finished. The cemetery covers an area of 100 mu, making it an unprecedented great building in the Buddhist community, and it is worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau Takes Over China Industrial Bank Prize Savings</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau previously received an order from the Ministry of Finance to take over prize savings from various banks and associations. The prize savings of the Sino-French Savings Society have been sorted out by the Bureau. Now, it is beginning to take over the special prize savings of the China Industrial Bank, and it has been decided that both parties will handle the handover procedures separately from July 1 to August 15. From August 16, the Central Trust Bureau will order the Central Savings Society to begin sorting it out. It has been learned that depositors holding China Industrial Bank savings certificates can exchange them at the Central Savings Society. After exchanging the prize savings certificates received by the society, there is no need to pay any fees. Moreover, there is no need to pay a cent at the time of the exchange. After the expiration, the savings can be withdrawn, and there is a monthly chance to win prizes (according to the original regulations of China Industrial Bank, the lottery was drawn every three months). The number of repayments upon maturity is greater than that originally stipulated by China Industrial Bank, and generous dividends can be shared. This exchange method is very favorable to China Industrial Bank depositors, and the certificates are the most cost-effective. If depositors do not want to exchange for Central Savings Society certificates, they can also withdraw the principal and interest according to the original regulations, without suffering any loss. It is said that the details of this reorganization method will be announced by the Central Savings Society soon.</p>
<h3>Number of Visitors to the Zoo in the First Half of the Year</h3>

In addition, in order to increase the interest of visitors, the zoo specially sent staff to Suzhou Xiyuan yesterday to purchase four soft-shelled turtles. It is said that the turtles are as big as bathtubs and weigh more than 100 jin. They will be transported to Shanghai for exhibition within days. The zoo's giant elephant was transported to Pudong for treatment due to illness a month ago, and it is said that it has not yet recovered.</p>
<h3>Taiping Bank Merged into Guohua Bank Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Taiping Bank in this port has been operating for seven years with a paid-in capital of 1 million yuan. It has had good results with annual surpluses. Although it has been in an unfavorable environment in recent years, its dividends can still be distributed as usual. At this session, the shareholders of the bank, with the diligent and capable management of the bank's manager, Wan Maozhi, had proposed to increase capital for expansion. However, Wan repeatedly declined due to illness caused by overwork, and it was decided to merge into Guohua Bank. The 1 million yuan of Taiping capital was discounted by 55%, amounting to 550,000 yuan. All items of deposits and debts were handled by Guohua. The transfer was implemented yesterday (1st). It is said that Manager Wan will go to Qingdao to recuperate within days.</p>
<h3>Wife Hangs Herself After Husband Takes Photo with Woman</h3>
<p>Chen Wu, 20, from Shandong, the wife of Chen Jingen, who lived at 73 Yaoshui Lane, Xiaoshadu, West Shanghai, found a photo of her husband and another woman together in a drawer in the afternoon of the previous day and harbored the thought of ending her life. She hanged herself from the eaves.

<h3>Smuggled Goods Seized Again Yesterday When Rokko Maru Arrived</h3>
<p>Smuggled Copper Coins Exported in the First Half of the Year Total Approximately 15,000 Jin</p>
<p>The customs anti-smuggling personnel still seized smuggled goods entering the country from time to time recently. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, when the Rokko Maru arrived from Japan, customs officers seized a total of more than 40 pieces of undeclared rayon and other miscellaneous goods, which were immediately confiscated. According to a report by the Shenshi News Agency, the smuggling of copper coins for export has been extremely rampant in the past few months, especially in March and April. Customs officers have also been violently beaten by ronin. Later, our country's authorities strictly prohibited unscrupulous merchants from illegally selling and transporting copper coins for export, so the smuggling of copper coins for export has gradually decreased recently. However, although there are no detailed statistics on smuggled copper coins in the first half of the year, it is estimated that there were a total of more than 150 dans, totaling more than 15,000 jin.</p>
<h3>Autumn Flood Coming, Huangpu River Will Have High Tide</h3>
<p>Highest from the 9th to the 11th – Bund Flood Protection Wall Under Construction – Rainfall Significantly Higher in the First Half of This Year</p>
<p>Due to the approaching autumn flood season, the tide in the Huangpu River is expected to be higher than usual. The dates of the high tide this month will be from the 9th to the 11th. Here is a detailed account:</p>
<p>Beginning of High Tide</p>
<p>According to the Huangpu Bureau's measurements, the highest tides this month will be from the 9th to the 11th. The morning tide on the 9th is estimated to be 11 feet 6 inches, the morning tide on the 10th is estimated to be 11 feet 9 inches, and the morning tide on the 11th is estimated to be 11 feet 7.6 inches. The time is before dawn, but the ebb time will be after dawn. At the same time, the tides in the Huangpu River will also be high on the 8th and 12th, 13th, and 3rd, but they will be less than the previously listed dates, so they will not be listed.</p>
<p>Status of Water Protection</p>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau is building a flood protection wall on the Bund embankment to defend against the autumn flood high tide. The section of the project from the Jiang'an in front of the New Customs to the Jiang'an of the Bund on Jiujiang Road has been completed 70-80%, and the rest is under construction. The wall is made of pure cement and is very strong. It has a unique effect on defending against high tides, and it also adds a charming touch to the scenery of the Jiang'an.</p>
<p>Significantly Higher Rainfall</p>
<p>Although the weather in this port has cleared up, the amount of rain has been high, exceeding that of last year. According to the records of the Drainage Bureau, a comparison is made below. This year's rainfall in January was 3.372 inches, in February 3.61 inches, in March 2.79 inches, in April 3.87 inches, in May 2.72 inches, and in June 4.08 inches. Last year, the monthly rainfall was 1.83 inches in January, 2.39 inches in February, 1.81 inches in March, 4.03 inches in April, 3.01 inches in May, and 5 inches in June.</p>

<h3>Airline Ticket Drawing for the Thirty-Sixth Period Today</h3>

<h3>Principal Offender in the Haiyan Ship Opium Case Arrested</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Brigade and Water Patrol Brigade, together with Customs Anti-Smuggling Section personnel, searched the Wenzhou-bound Haiyan ship docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf in the Sixteenth Area on the morning of the 23rd of last month. They found thirty packages of opium, weighing approximately two hundred taels. At that time, they detained four suspects: Yao Daquan from Dinghai, a tea server; Cao Chiyao from Yuyao; Zhu Yuanfang from Yangzhou; and He Dexing from Zhenjiang. They were taken to the bureau for questioning. The principal offender in the case was apprehended by Detective Brigade personnel and patrol officers at 2:00 AM yesterday at the Dongchengli intersection on Limmalu Road in the South Shanghai area. He gave his name as Xu Guohuai, forty-four years old, from Hefei, residing at No. 6 Kangqulu Road, Gaochang Temple. However, he was evasive and refused to confess. He has been temporarily detained for further investigation and will be tried together with the others.</p>

<h3>Woman Deceived and Defiled Sent to Charity Organization for Adoption</h3>
<p>Wound Healed, Discharged from Hospital</p>
<p>Zhu Baozhen, the woman who was deceived and defiled and who sought assistance from the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association last month, has recovered from her injuries and been discharged from the hospital. The case is under investigation by the Shanghai Local Court. However, since the woman has no relatives in Shanghai after leaving the hospital, the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association, deeply sympathetic to her plight, sent a letter to the Zhabei Charity Organization Foster Home yesterday, requesting that she be taken in for care. The original letter is excerpted below: Respectfully, Ms. Zhu Baozhen, a native of Ningbo, has been deceived and defiled and has no family in Shanghai. Her situation is pitiful. Therefore, we are sending Zhu Baozhen to your organization and request that you take her in for care and provide assistance. We hope you will investigate and handle this matter accordingly. To, Zhabei Charity Organization.</p>

<h3>For Whom Does One Die?</h3>
<p>— Nai Yi</p>
<p>The young man Dai Dunrong committed suicide by throwing himself into the Huangpu River. In his pocket, he left behind a photograph of a man and a woman. The man was himself, and the woman was his wife. On the back of the woman's photograph were five words: "Dying for you." This news was reported in the newspapers the day before yesterday. Yesterday's newspapers also had follow-up news about him, explaining the reason for his suicide. It turned out that the love between him and his wife was originally "very deep." "However, his mother-in-law had different opinions from Dai, and last year, Yizhen (Dai's wife's name) returned to Ningbo and never came back. The mother repeatedly urged her son-in-law to marry someone else." Afterward, it is said that the son-in-law and mother-in-law often argued. After the last argument, Dai Dunrong felt that "life was meaningless" and then threw himself into the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Regarding suicide, I always feel that it is a foolish thing that benefits neither the person nor others. Someone with a strong personality, that is, someone with a strong intellect, is unlikely to do such a foolish thing. However, being rich in emotion is not a crime and can even be said to be a virtue. When someone rich in emotion does such a foolish thing, there is an environment behind it that compels them to do so, which we cannot ignore. We certainly have the right and obligation to tell emotionally vulnerable people that they should live on with greater strength, but if we let go of the sinister hands behind them, it is not only unfair but also useless!</p>
<p>Whether there are other hidden circumstances in Dai Dunrong's suicide and why he disagreed with his mother-in-law is unknown to us. However, based on "never returned" and "urged the son-in-law to marry someone else," it is clear that there is a feudal demon at work here. Love is a matter for two people, and no third party has the right to interfere, especially since they are already husband and wife, and even more so since they are a couple with "very deep love." However, in the eyes of feudal parents, not only are unmarried children property, but even after they are married, although they can use "a daughter who has been married off is like water that has been poured out" to shirk responsibility, they will still use "where did she come from" as a reason for "private property" if there is any benefit. Therefore, as long as there is a disagreement with the son-in-law, it becomes natural to keep the daughter from returning. And daughters who grow up in a feudal environment, even if they have reached the stage of "following their husband after marriage," and even if they are husband and wife with "very deep love,"</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>after "returning to Ningbo," still take their parents' will as their own because they are accustomed to obedience.</p>
<p>Like Dai Dunrong, but almost killed by the feudal demon, was the poison suicide attempt of the guide Li Jianhua. The reason for Li Jianhua's poison suicide attempt was that her fiancé, to whom she was engaged in her early years, felt that it was "a disgrace to the family" because she became a guide, so he "proposed to break off the engagement and intended to marry someone else." When Li heard this, she also thought it was "a great disgrace" and "resented and hated each other, unable to face people," so she took the lower tactic of taking poison!</p>
<p>Whether becoming a guide is "a disgrace to the family" should be determined by whether the guide sells her body, etc. But then "who caused it to happen?" Did the guide herself willingly degenerate?</p>
<p>Yes, at present, female guides are a distorted "women's occupation." In the minds of most people, this is something that impure women do. But how did it become impure, and how did it become so developed?</p>
<p>To reiterate Li Jianhua's experience, if she had not been engaged in her early years, she would not have had this "great disgrace" this time. However, under the system of early marriage, she was "betrothed to a certain family in her early years."</p>
<p>And is breaking off an engagement a "great disgrace"? Yes, it is indeed a "great disgrace" to have an engagement broken off because one is deemed "a disgrace to the family." However, for women who grow up in feudalism, the "great disgrace" that is feared is probably not being deemed "a disgrace to the family," but rather the "broken engagement" caused by being deemed "a disgrace to the family!" For women who are raised and educated in feudalism, the only weapon of resistance is only death. For example, Ruan Lingyu, who played the role of "New Woman," also used the word "death" as her weapon of resistance.</p>
<p>Children are innocent, the fault lies with society, but with what do we resist this sinful society?</p>
<p>I would like to ask this to those who do not wish to die!</p>
<h3>Drum Singer</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lu</p>
<p>— Remembering Beiping</p>
<p>At night, I passed through the solemn Chao Gate and strolled from the darkness to Ren Street in Qianmen. The lights of an alley, beckoning like temptations, unfolded the night market in dazzling brilliance.</p>
<p>I walked into a bustling alley and, amid the shouts of rickshaw pullers, stepped into a place called a "lou" (building). From the dim staircase, I turned into a room on the second floor. The lights were extraordinarily bright, and red banners were hung all around, with many laudatory sentences written on them.</p>
<p>In rows of seats, one could find several elderly men with beards. They no longer pretended to be moralistic scholars, their faces equally full of the passion, desire, and greedy eyes of young men.</p>
<p>A beautifully dressed girl strolled to the front of the stage, and many listeners below became tense. When the drum singer gently said a few polite words, a torrent of praise arose. The drum singer smiled, flashed her bright eyes, and, tapping the drum with her hands, spat out from her small cherry lips many historical stories singing the praises of ancient heroes. A group of the audience was enchanted by her beautiful posture.</p>
<p>"Those who come every day have intentions," a friend whispered in my ear, pointing to two people, including an old man with a beard.</p>
<p>In front of my eyes, a picture of a wax beast seemed to unfold. Each of them greedily searched for lovable little beasts, using silken methods to play with money and exchange it for their charming smiles. Afterward, they would move toward their homes, and before long, they could hunt down their captives.</p>
<p>A girl lowered her head and went inside, and another drum singer replaced her. Each of them wore gorgeous clothes, their faces covered with powder, and their cheeks covered with red rouge. On their slender fingers, they wore glittering rings, and their nails were painted with rose-colored oil.</p>
<p>"They don't have good destinies," my friend said with a sigh. "Their lives are miserable. Now they are like lambs, listening to people's piecemeal slaughter. Afterward, they will be embraced by some master or other and become a concubine, I don't know which number. This is still considered a happy ending. If the day comes when their faces fade, then everything will be over!"</p>
<p>A singing girl on the stage was gently singing about a grieving girl, burying a section of the 残花 that had been pushed down and was scattering away. I looked at her, and I seemed unable to see the captivating face, the graceful figure. I only saw her terrible shadow. She may be like the fate of those desolate 残花.</p>
<p>I seemed unable to hear anything. The human tragedy was always burning in my heart. I silently pondered.</p>
<p>Late at night, when the last girl finished singing her drum lyrics, many people crowded out.</p>
<p>There was no moon, no stars in the sky. The weak lights in the alley shone on the ground, casting many intricate shadows.</p>
<h3>Starting from Youth Reading Selections</h3>
<p>— Ya Lu</p>
<p>With the needs of the times, the knowledge and nourishment for youth is really very urgent. Among the reading materials published in the current publishing world, although they are "vast as the sea," it is simply not easy to find a few books that are beneficial to young people. If we go to the magazine sales outlets on Fourth Avenue and carefully browse, we feel that soft reading materials have a tendency to override hard reading materials. These publications that harm the minds and hearts of young people and numb their thoughts are particularly numerous. This cannot but be said to be a malformed phenomenon in the current publishing world!</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>We must understand that books can not only answer our various difficult problems, but also gradually increase our vitality. Therefore, young people must use strict eyes to choose reading materials, and look for books that are beneficial, practical, and in line with their personality to read. We do not oppose reading or studying humorous articles and loose essays, but in this era of national hardship, various academic sciences urgently need practical applications. We can no longer waste our young people's precious time on reading materials that do more harm than good. This is something that young people with a mission in the times should deeply distinguish.</p>
<p>Finally, considering the interests of young people, we sincerely hope that well-known writers in the country will abandon those empty and meaningless works and publish more works that encourage young people to study diligently, especially works that inspire patriotism and love for the people, so that they can jointly shoulder the great mission of resisting the enemy and saving the country!</p>
