<p>時事</p>
<h3>評修正出版法施行細則</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>吾國現行出版法。是去年十一月間頒佈的。因為該法施行細則。舊有的已失效力。所以事實上新出版法到現在還沒有生效。據本月三日本報專電。內政部已訂定新出版法施行細則二十八條。經行政院會議通過。稍經文字之整理。卽可頒佈施行。細則中最重要兩點。便是規定報紙及通信社成立之最低資本數目。和報紙發行人的最低敎育程度。在六個月以內。在已登記的報社。都要補行資本額數登記。那些資本不足的報社。免不了受淘汰。如果因此而達到除莠存良。重質量不重數量的結果。當然是我們十分希望的。</p>
<p>新出版法及施行細則的目的。無非是使報界在中央政府領導下。走上合理化之途徑。立法用意。未可厚非。其方法。第一是出刋登記。使政府認為不必要的刋物。無誕生之可能。第二是登載限制。使已經誕生之刋物。在記載上言論上。能循規蹈矩。達國家之需要。不出言論之正軌。第二項工作。有新聞檢查制度之存在。政府隨時可以施行權力。第一項工作。舊出版法上規定得很不淸楚。新出版法則有較嚴密之規定。在聲請登記時。要陳明各報之社務組織及資本數目經濟狀况等。發行人之資格。亦有種種限制。不過在審查登記表時。到底有多少資本才算合格。發行人要受過什麼程度的敎育出版法上並未規定。施行細則對於此二問題則有詳盡答覆。</p>
<p>根據本報三日之記載。凡是在人口百萬城市刋行之報紙。最低資本為一萬元。發通訊稿。則最低資本為三千元。百萬人口以下省市政府所在地之城市。則報紙刋行。資本至少六千。通訊社一千。在縣政府所在地。報紙為一千元。通訊社為二百元。刋行報紙與發通訊稿之發行人。必須具有下列資格之一。或大學或專科以上學校畢業。或高中畢業有三年以上之辦報經騐。或曾在新聞事業主管機關服務三年以上。或有五年辦報之經騐。這些規定。並非是使報紙之經濟基礎穩固。負責人之知識標準提高。使濫竽充數之報紙與報人。無所容於神聖之言論界。</p>
<p>當然這些限制。同歐洲日本各國比較起來。並非嚴格。日本的報紙在東京及大阪者。發刋之前要繳二千元之保護金。如有犯法。政府卽以此款扣取罰金。德國新聞紙法規定。凡未受專門訓練而無發表輿論之能力者。不能取得新聞記者之資格。同時中國報界。不健全的報紙與通訊社。實在太多。因經濟基礎之不健全。往往有藉津貼及其他損害信譽之方法為生。而自墮報紙之品格者。因報人資格之無限制。往往有亳無社會科學知識。無職業訓練。因而無健全之報業道德及責任心者。厠身報界此種現象在內地為尤甚。為肅清報界。提高水準。出版法細則上之規定。是合於需要的。</p>
<p>不過我們政府與新聞界要注意的。第一。中國報業。與歐美比較尚在草萊初闢時期。在這個時期。我們於資本及人才之要求。不能太嚴格。在過去往往有非常之士。無充分之財力亦無專門之訓練。徒賴其創造天才與個人毅力。努力報業。而有成就。如美國富蘭克林以印刷匠一躍為一代輿論之宗。巴拿德以五百元資本。創紐約最成功之報紙。先賢盛業。可資楷模。現在報紙以印刷事業之發達及內容之專門化。固不可無大資本與專材。然比較其他商業與文化事業。冒險之可能多些。如法律限制太嚴。則靑年有志之士。熱心於創業者徒興望洋之嘆。而富豪階級。商人勢力。不免滲入輿論界。而使報業失其自主獨力之精神。</p>
<p>第二。出版法及施行細則中所規定。均為消極之限制。除莠汰弱固可以使良而强者有發展之機會。然政府於中國幼稚之報業如不予積極之扶助。前途仍未可樂觀。大都市如京滬平津欲辦一報。斷非萬金資本。高中大學以上畢業生。所可勝任。日常紙墨等原料之昂貴。競爭之劇烈。往往使報紙難於自存。故政府與報界。應積極從事於經濟困難之打破。同業之團結。標準之提高。紀律之執行。人才之訓練。不然徒憑法律之消極工作。仍不能使中國報業達欣欣向榮之途徑。</p>

<h3>引言</h3>
<p>— 俞鴻鈞</p>
<p>人類有兩大敵，一為疾疫，一為死亡，關心人羣福利之歐美醫學家，科學家，畢生注其全力於此兩大敵之撲滅，及今死亡雖未能克，而自微菌學之說興，疾疫來源，都有確實認識，與相當研究，治療防禦之術旣精，人類壽命，遂得以逐漸延長，死亡比率，亦年為之减，我國典籍雖間有養生攝生之篇，然類多道家方士關於個人攝養之譚，難言於今日之衛生，尤難言於今日之公共衛生，迄鴉片戰後，海禁大開，新學輸入，國人起居飲食，漸知注重清潔，然亦僅限於個人，見於都市，尚未至有整個衛生行政計劃之時期，民國肇造，內戰不休，北京政府，各省官吏，更無睱力顧念及此，自國民政府奠都南京，知國民健康之不能忽，衛生行政不容緩，於是中央設署，市設局，縣設所，以重其事，而我國衛生事務，乃有統一負責機關，比年以來，衛生事業突飛猛進，國民康健狀况，日見優良，其來蓋有自也。</p>
<p>上海為中外交通孔道，人烟稠密，情形複雜，觀瞻所繫，衛生問題尤為市政首要之務，故市政府成立之始，則設衛生局，釐訂衛生行政方針，逐步實施，歷年以來，雖限於經費，未能盡將理想，一一實現，然於防疫的設置，烟毒之滅除與其他促進市民健康之種種努力，尚獲社會稱許，而市立諸醫院之設建，亦都具近代規模，今屆市政府成立十週紀念，復舉行衛生展覽，及印以衛生特刋，凡所以喚起市民衛生觀念，灌輸衛生常識者，大體都備，惟展覽與特刋之目的，在貢獻市民以相當之衛生認識，一方冀其為權利之享受，一方又盼其為義務之履行，蓋“取之於市民者用之於市民”乃市府曁其所屬各機關為市民服務之基本原則，故從純粹市政一方面言，市府及其所屬一切設施，悉為市民為權利之享受，而以關於衛生諸項為尤殷，但從國民責任一方面言，市民有疾不治，有疫不防，或其行為有害於公共衛生，則不僅削弱個人體力，抑且妨碍公衆健康，而直接减失民族實力，有背國民天職，故無論為權利，為義務，為個人，為國家，我市民對於衛生種種設施都應深切注意，對於衛生種種規則，都應嚴厲遵從，以助衛生行政之推進，非為市政府也，為市民個人也，非為市民個人也，為整個民族也，第眼前民敎猶未普及，公民常識猶未提高，至相當水準恐衛生意義與其關係之重大，難得普遍之認識，市政府衛生局職責所在，今後於市區鄉村衛生事業之推廣，與衛生知識之灌輸，自應加緊工作，以求各個市民都有健全之體格，與健全之精神，然潛移默化，樹之風尚，尤賴有識人士之提倡與宣傳，是則斯刋之作，其有望於我開明之市民者深矣。</p>
<h3>夏令衛生運動的意義</h3>
<p>— 金寶善</p>
<p>夏令衛生運動，給予社會敎育上的價值，是無限量的，誰都承認它在人們的日常生活上所貢獻的幸福與利益。我國現沒有倡導夏令衛生運動以前和在已經倡導夏令衛生運動以後，一般民衆對於衛生知識的缺乏與進步，是自顯然不同。以前民衆，對於撲滅蚊蠅，認為是一種無足輕重的工作，自從有了衛生運動之後，有許多地方，都自動地來組織撲滅蚊蠅的運動，這從每年夏季的新聞紙上的記載，便能看得出來。此外對於預防接種，如注射傷寒霍亂等預防疫苗等，一向都抱觀望或懷疑的態度，自從有了夏令衛生運動之後各地自願注射的人數日漸增多，祇要看近幾年來夏令傷寒霍亂疫苗用量的激增，便可以推知，凡此種種，均能夠看出一般民衆對於健康敎育知識的增進，同時政府於公共衛生事業推進的方策上，如何使民衆能夠發生同情與接受，其唯一的辦法，只有依賴夏令衛生運動作一種宣達意旨的工具。夏令衛生運動在這種塲合，等於一條主要的橋樑，它介於民衆與政府之間，公共衛生事業的基礎建立，第一道難關，是需要使民衆完成心理上的建設，使民衆的心理上預先對於公共衛生具有深刻的印景。然而此種任務。决不是公共衛生事業的本身所能單獨來擔負的夏令衛生運動所包含的一切，以及它於社會敎育上的發揮，却很便宜的，自然的將這個任務擔負起來，並且已經獲得了相當的效果。</p>
<p>過去的夏令衛生運動（是指國內各大城市一概而論）除掉站在上述的立塲完成它的使命之外，更把握了實際的需要，然後疾病自然减少，個衆自然康健。不過這種目的，却不是在一地一使民衆的日常生活，已漸趨於科學化的水準。它給予社會文化推進的助力，亦不容忽視，今後的夏令衛生運動，似乎有更進一層的必要。它的活動力應該從社會的表層伸展到社會底層去，使每一個家庭單位，都能夠受到夏令衛生運動的影響，使每一民家庭主婦，都能夠獲得豐富的夏令衛生知識，表現於家政的處理上，次夏令衛生運動就能夠完全達到的，必得有賴於擔負此種運動的工作人員底長期的努力，才能告成。</p>
<h3>衛生還是為了自己</h3>
<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>衛生兩個字。在一班民衆的眼光看來。似乎是一種極深奧。極複雜。極不容易實行的新學問。大有仰不可見。高不可攀的觀念。并且還有人們誤解。以為衛生是國家的行政。是社會的設施。是大衆的事業。而與我們個人自己。絕不相干。絕無關聯的樣子。其實這都是思想的錯誤。和精神的幻覺。</p>
<p>生物都是好生惡死的。尤其是我們人類。感覺到做人的意味。做人的責任。和做人的地位。當然有珍重自己生命。保衛自己身體的希冀而研究種種趨吉避凶的方術。簡單說一句。要想維持自己生命的安全。不得不計圖自衛和禦侮的策略。這策略。自然很複雜。很廣汎。很微妙。而衛生。便是其中之一。</p>
<p>我常說衛生思想的起原。决不是人為的。是生物有生以來所固有的。不過沒有一個指導。大家不明趨避。沒有遇到危害。大家不加注意是了。比方就說我們古時。唐虞之世。若沒有獸蹄鳥跡。交於中國。便不會起逐驅禽獸的注意也决不會想出使益掌火。歷山澤而焚的方法。還有倘使那時沒有洪水橫流。泛濫天下。也不會起防治水患的注意。更不會使禹想出隨山刋本。奠高山大川的方法。所以危害。是給大家服的一貼刺激藥。人們受了痛苦。才會引起注意力。而覺悟到不得不講究應付和救濟的方法以達自衛禦侮的目的。孟子不說過嗎。“無敵國外患者國恒亡。”便是這個意思。</p>
<p>從古幾千年來。我們人類所受的一切的一切危害。早不知多少了。受一次危害。便多一次敎訓。也便是學一次乖覺。換一句說。服一貼刺激藥。便來一個反應。興奮一次。更認識一次刺激藥的作用。所以我們可以說。今日的衛生方法。一半是感受疾病敎訓的反應。一半是人類理智表現的一端。表面上。是為大衆謀幸福。其實個人自己。旣是大家的一分子不就是為我們自己嗎。</p>
<p>衛生運動的意義。根據上面所說。已很明瞭就是說由受過危害的敎訓。而所學的乖。來告訴大家。並且將人類理智上的心得來指導大家一個趨吉避凶的方法。大家都能明瞭了這許多方法。而實行起來。不但大衆都可以得到一個安全。而大衆的安全。便是自己的安全。回轉來說。講究衛生。實行衛生。結果還是為了自己。</p>
<p>這裹我可舉幾個實例來。給大家作個家庭衛生上的參考吧。比方說夏秋之間。多發的紅白痢和霍亂等。現在已經明白。他的病原。是赤痢菌。和變形蟲。並霍亂菌等。不過赤痢和霍亂菌的傳播方法。除不潔的水漿之外。最多是由蒼蠅的傳搬。因為蒼蠅。常喜歡叢集在污穢之處。又喜歡停止在食物上。所以他的脚上。帶着的污物。就可傳搬到我們的食物上。而食物上帶的污物。便可入我們的腹中。不就發病了嗎。可是這個蒼蠅。他並不認識人。他所停止的食物。並不曉得是誰入口。你要是放生蒼蠅。不去處置他時。你便時常帶着許多的危險。你的家人。也時常帶着許多的危險。表面上說起來。拍個把蒼蠅。成什麼問題。也不用大驚小怪。而宣傳衛生的人們。都滔滔的說。撲滅蒼蠅。是為提倡公共衛生。似乎是為了大家的事。其實不認識人的蒼蠅。他或者倒喜歡親近你呢。那麼撲滅蒼蠅。也儘可以說。為了我們自己。</p>
<p>比方還有像癆病的傳染。現在大家都已明白。為吸入灰塵中所含的癆菌而發病的最多。原時灰塵中的勞菌。大都是因癆病人的痰。吐在地上。乾燥之後。混在塵中。飛起的緣故。那麼癆病人的痰。吐在地上。便是癆病傳染的大原因了。你要知道。灰塵。他本沒有眼睛。而隨風飄蕩的。也不曉得是你的鼻孔。他的口腔。和通風的洞。出氣的門。他總是隨意流動着。所以我們要是活着。而不斷的呼吸時。便到處帶着三分的危險性。那麼你想勸人不要把痰吐在地上說起來。為的是要顧全大衆的公共衛生。其實我們具着两個鼻孔。一張口。而沒有斷絕呼吸的時候。不是都得着他的利益他的保障嗎。說起來。還是為了我們自己。</p>
<p>照上面所舉的單簡實例看來。無論什麼區處。什麼時候什麼情形你要是不講衛生。結果。人家果然要受你的累。轉過來說。還是自己害了自己。</p>
<h3>大會宣言</h3>
<p>民族的生存競爭，到現在已經成了最急迫的時代了。其競爭的要素有六：</p>
<p>㊀體力，</p>
<p>㊁智力，</p>
<p>㊂勇敢，</p>
<p>㊃機敏，</p>
<p>㊄耐久，</p>
<p>㊅團結，</p>
<p>這六種要素，雖然包含身體與精神兩方面。然而健全的精神，寓於健全的身體，沒有强健，决沒有健全的精神，所以復興民族的根本要素，還是在求身體的健康，而要使身體健康，最基本的，還是要切實的提倡衛生！</p>
<p>過去我們中華民族，所以在競爭舞台上幕幕失敗，處於帝國主義被壓迫的地位，就是因為我們的身體不强健，智識不充足，缺乏勇敢精神，沒有向上意志，不能耐久，不能團結，所以只有任人宰割，任人侮辱！</p>
<p>現在，我們如果是覺悟了，應當積極的把衛生事業，建設起來；把衛生知識，搬運出起，使全體民衆，都有一種强壯的身體，健全的精神，堅决的意志，以及耐久與團結的毅力。這樣，不但可以使敵人稍戢其野心，而且對於民族復興的前途，可以得到一個確實的保障。</p>
<p>本市舉行衛生運動，今次已是十六屆了，歷次衛生運動舉行的成效如何，雖是難有正確的估計，然而我們並不計及暫時的成敗得失，但願把我們上述的意義與精神，發揚而光大！</p>

<h3>葉文津等報告　留日學生遭受摧殘痛苦</h3>
<p>東京留學生均不安於學　將向中央及許大使請願</p>
<p>東京各大學中國留學生同學會、各省同鄉會、及各留學文化團體等、以我國留日學生、時受日當局無故逮捕、橫加壓迫、致人心惶惶、無法向學、特推派代表葉文津返國、向中央當局及許大使請求救濟、以便五千留日學生、得安心攻讀、葉氏並於昨日下午三時、假坐公館馬路冠生園招待新聞界•文化界•報告詳情、並由最近被逐返國之世界編譯社負責人盧耀武•楊憲吾•即席報告該社被封情形、日內並將晋謁許大使請願、茲紀詳情如下、</p>
<p>留日學生惶恐狀况</p>
<p>葉文津報告東京留學生不安狀况、略云、留日學生在東京已具悠久歷史、惟近年時有任意被捕被逐事件發生、即以最近半年而言、二月中貿東新聞被封、張健冬等被其捕逐、月中有譯文社魏猛克等被捕逐回、最近六月十二日、又有世界編譯社八人被捕、亦經分別逐回、除成批者外、其餘陸續被逐回國者、尚無統計、故在東京學生、已感到極大威脅、特派本人返國、向國內同胞報告實况、請求救濟、由此研究學問團體之一被封被逐、足徵彼邦對留日學生文化上之摧殘、留日學生惟一目的、厥在求知與研究、上述被封機關、均為純粹研究學問而組織、且已具有數年歷史者、彼當局無故壓抑、使東京留日學生、不易滿足求知之慾、日本且將我國留華生分開、即稱我東北四省之同學為“滿洲國”留學生、關內為中華民國留學生、不僅在稱謂上將我們分開、而且各大學中我們之同學會、亦必須强迫分開組織、他們對於我們互相來往、監視極嚴、對於東北同學、尤其用種種手段恫嚇脅迫、使東北同學對國內同學們畏避、不敢接近、他們不但對於我們的朋友來往、私人信件、團體活動、如學術研究•同學會•同鄉會之類、不惜利用各種非法手段來偵探、甚至私拆我們的信件、私人我們的住室、偷翻文稿日記、在以法治出名之國家、對於鄰邦留學生如此非法、實屬遺憾、他們私用庚子賠款、希圖製造漢奸、對於東北籍之留學生、尤常以之為餌、他們對於我們愛國學生即認為“反滿抗日”分子、常私自加以侮辱、一旦捕去、一例被監禁刑訊、結果即加以“反滿抗日”、甚或加以赤化之罪名驅逐回國、</p>
<p>最近八人被捕經過</p>
<p>繼由六月三十七日被逐回之盧耀武•楊憲吾•報告世界編譯社突然被封同人被捕逐回、經過略云、世界編繹社、在東京成立已垂兩年、平素研究各國學識、思想純正、工作為編譯及交換學問、頗得一般同學贊許、於六月十二日忽遭日警事廳搜查、搜查結果、一無所得、然負責者本人（盧耀武）及楊憲吾•王孔昭•石寶瑚•趙圭壁•楊式殻•劉淸貞•鄧克强•等、即被分別逮捕、拘留至同月二十八日、始分別逐回、第一批為楊憲吾等、第二批為王孔昭等、第三批為本人等、第四批為趙圭壁等、當被監禁時、均在密室審訊、且迄未有任何罪狀披露、故此次被逐、全係該當局有計劃之行動、然吾人祇能黯然而返、</p>
<p>向許大使請願救濟</p>
<p>該返國代表葉文津等、為保持留日學生安全及專心向學起見、將於日內向中央當局及駐日大使許世英氏請願、請求交涉、留日學生應有相當保障、須得到法律範圍內之自由、要求研究學問的自由、因留學生著述翻譯、均為份內之事、橫遭干涉、即無法求進步、同時更要求交涉日方不得無故任意逮捕留學生、庶留日五千餘學生、必有所安、又留日學生因感於我國學生前往求學者、籍貫在關內各省者、被認為支那學生、在東四省者、被認為“偽滿”學生、且不能有談話接洽等機會、精神上極感刺激與苦痛、諸種情形、尤盼國人予以深切注意、</p>

<h3>香伙趕出和尚的回擊</h3>
<p>— 甄士林</p>
<p>香伙在和尚廟里住久了，自然不免要覬覦廟里的產業，於是反客為主，香伙趕出和尚來。</p>
<p>這情形，和上海的租界倒很相像。</p>
<p>所謂租界，原是指在通商口岸劃定界限租地通商的區域；承租各國的商民能夠在界內租地建屋；雖然界內的事務，可由各國自設機關管理，但這裹最不能忽略的，便是地方的主權，仍是屬於中國。</p>
<p>然而上海租界的實際情形是怎樣呢？中國人在租界內所遭受的待遇又是如何？“大權旁落，俯仰由人”這是過去數十年來的積弊，到了現在，越法變本加厲起來，租界變成了他們的殖民地了！單以映演電影戲劇而論，經過中央電檢會許可的作品不能在租界上自由放映，面對侮辱中國的影片，却假作病聾，這一種越權不公允的舉動，到最近，因達到了最高峯，才促醒了中華民族的自覺，於是文化界有撤銷租界電影戲曲檢查權的運動，加入的團體有十六個，並且舉出了五個籌備委員，定於十一日開成立大會了。</p>
<p>這是香伙趕出和尚以後，和尚於創巨痛深之餘所預備還擊的開端，說“開端”，顯然還不是“終極”的目的；但雖不是終極的目的，而這次還擊的責任却是非常重大。如果還擊不力，不僅氣餒之餘，會影響到以後的戰門力，而且頭一砲不響，香伙知道和尚實力的單薄，會壓迫得更厲害，到了那時，怕非弄到和尚們焦頭爛額不止。</p>
<p>而最不幸的是，我們現在做了被趕出廟門的和尚，而有些還不自覺，以為被趕那是當然的。所以我以為初步的工作，便是喚起大家，一致加入“還擊”的集團。撤銷租界電檢權，不單是少數人的事，更不單是文化界的事，租界上每個居民都有起來參加努力的必要。只有集中多數人的力量才是眞正的力量。</p>
<p>我們所要告訴香伙和自己的，我們現在這一種還擊並不是基於“仇洋”的心理，這僅僅是收回我們失去了多年的主權，這一種主權無論誰失去之後，都有收回的必要的。</p>
<p>工作的艱巨是無疑的，而加緊壓迫也是意料中的事，我們之同，必須聯合起來，培植一種堅强的自信力，我們篤信“公理”和“光明”並不怎樣堅持着和我們分離，如其我們以絕大的决心去追求的話。</p>
<p>願以這篇短文貢獻於“上海文化界撤銷電影戲曲檢查權運動會”，並以至誠祝是會的成功，和全上海三百多萬市民的實力援助！</p>

<h3>老獵戶</h3>
<p>— 瑞瑤</p>
<p>最近家中來了信，於末尾處有這樣的一段：“福祥伯伯，前月已被拿槍殺了。聽說是通匪刦掠遭的禍；但他是否幹了這樣的事呢，這是誰也不大清楚的。不過，看他近年來過的艱苦日子，人的確是較前變的多了！……”</p>
<p>自從我有記憶時起，這個老頭早已是我們這個小鄉鎮中的一個著名獵戶了。他雖也有一個所謂“家”，但家中除從祖先手裹承受下來的一間破屋，活了三十多歲，才靠自己的力量討來的一個老婆，以及幾隻做為謀生工具的獵狗外，沒有別的什麼足以記錄的東西。在他的腦子里，沒有什麼豪奢的希望，沒有長遠的大計；沒有夢，也沒有恩怨的念頭，但他却也有他自己的信仰，自己做人的規範：他迷信事業，迷信勤苦耐勞來做活，乃是人的天職；所以儘管他所過的日子是多麼艱苦，他却老像載重的老渡船似的，沒有呻吟，沒有哀怨，默默地負起生活的重壓，將一串串沈悶的日子打發過去。</p>
<p>無論是那一個日子，東方一發了白，他就備了一些乾糧，邀集了他的幾個老獵伴，携着網，帶着狗，一同走進遼遠的山林中去；直至太陽落了山，甚至明凈的月亮高高地懸掛在蔚藍的天空上時，才又帶着滿身的疲倦，蹌蹌踉踉地走回來。不管他的獵獲是多少，各種野味的價格都是一定的，而且比起別人的來，都來得便宜一點．所以，每當夕陽斜掛在遠處的峯嶺上時，他家里就等待着不少顧客了；而人一回抵家門，獵物也就被搶買得一空。如果這天的獵獲特別好，那他就會留下一隻狐貍，或一隻野豬，野兎，來為自己受用。他一面吩咐老婆携這東西去宰殺，而且已就携那一隻不曉得從多少年前流傳下來的葫蘆，拖着倦了的雙眼，到五里多遠的黃鎮去買酒。每當酒買回來，老婆烹調的菜也快要弄好了。這時他又得到隣鄉去邀請他的獵伴，同村中三二個同他年紀相當的老年人，到他家里來一同喝酒。人一坐上酒席，話也就跟着多起來了。他們談着打獵，談着年成，談着在各人的記憶中已褪了色的遠年故事，……這樣談着，總得談到三更以後，才各自分了手。如果要問，在他所過的這一大堆日子中，是否也有感到快樂的時候，那像他這樣的度過的一晚，就算是他頂高興，頂痛快的一晚了。</p>
<p>他自己沒有兒孫輩，但他却十分喜愛孩子。誰家的孩子到了他的家，他都像對自己的親生兒那麼地，用他枯澀的手，慈祥地頭頂上摸了摸，臉頰上摸了摸；有時還會拿出一些獸肉來給孩子吃，說一通故事或山林中所見所聞的奇特的景物給孩子聽。當時，在我幼稚的童心中，就十分羨慕着他這種優遊自在的生活，總巴不得自己快點長大起來，一同偕他到荒涼的山林深谷中去過日子。其實，這又何嘗只是孩子們有這樣的心想呢？我們這鄉鎮中的莊稼人家，誰個不常常用欽羨的口吻這麼說着：“福祥伯伯眞是命好，天災不用他管，糧價不用他管，袋中沒錢了，可到山中去拿，鍋里沒米了，可到山中去拿，眞是…</p>
<p>前年我在北平，有位朋友從故鄉來，談起福祥伯伯的近况來時，就這樣凄切地歎息着，“現在地方窮，誰的兩餐白飯，還苦沒有方法弄來，那里還有閒錢來吃野味呢！他老人家過的日子，實在是大不如從前了！……”當時聽了，只覺大家的日子難過，在他駝了的背脊上，也不過多添了些生活的重負而已，這於他這個慣於荷負重壓的老年人，或不算得什麼大難堪的。那想得到日子只過了一年多，他就會得到這樣的收塲呢！</p>
<h3>讀者呼聲　小商人底呼號</h3>
<p>— 閘北一市民</p>
<p>小烟兌店商人底困苦，若不是身歷其境，是斷不能體會到他們底個中况味的，他們以整數的錢買進了貨物，零零碎碎的賣了出去，其麻煩和瑣屑，再也沒有其他的事情可以比擬了，可是他們這樣辛勤的結果，因為應納的烟酒捐，鹽捐，房捐，之外，還有當地的流氓，年年每逢端五，中秒，年底等節，照例須索節規，秋季打𫑿，另須寫捐，蹩脚些的或者貪婪些的平時還要借錢，種種說不出的名目，必須供給，否則會給你一個明的或者暗的吃虧，甚至難想繼續開市等等關係，僅僅得到一個開銷，慢說衣食舒適，上跳舞塲戲院大飯店等享樂了！</p>
<p>記者先生啊，你們是能夠為民請命的，如今我所間接受到也許將來也要直接受到的壓迫痛苦，並且也正可以代表着全上海許多小商人底呼號的，向先生訴述了，敢請把它刋列出來，希望當局能夠明瞭小商人底痛苦，加以體恤，予以寬放！事情是這樣的：！</p>
<p>閘北☓路底一家槽坊，店主☓，在閘北開設京貨店已數十餘年，平生謹愼將事，尤其對於國家捐稅一項，更屬留心，去年因在☓路開設之雜貨店營業惡劣，卽改變方針，在現在之☓路盤一槽坊，至今已及一年，香烟一項，為其兼營之一種貨物，生意實在少數，惟去年從☓路搬來之後，尚有雪茄一種，（查騐云為無牌，且該公司今已停業，尚未脫售，因該路係一貧民窟，並無雪茄烟之吸戶，乃擱之櫉中，一年工夫，幾已忘去，該店主若知此烟乃在禁賣之列時，當時必秘密收藏矣。</p>
<p>出其不意的，於且前突來數人，帶同警察逕入該店，形勢緊張，如捕大盜，如臨大敵，聲言檢查冒牌香烟，店主是很忠實的一個老人，自然就讓他任意翻閱，但結果並未發現任何冒牌香烟。</p>
<p>突然地，檢查者在舊櫥中發見了久已為店主或店員所已忘去的那種雪茄了</p>
<p>於是老店主給帶到警察分局查騐總所，再到閘北查騐分所，輾轉地累了天，任憑你怎樣說明，起初説是須騐保證金三十元，後來因為店主拿不出這許多錢，减繳了十元，才給了一張收據那樣的東西出來了。</p>
<p>收據，是給店主再度拿到總查騐所去訊問的憑據，它寫的可眞侮辱人了！</p>
<p>什麼“由☓☓☓等在☓路緝獲☓☓☓私賣無牌雪茄……”啊！“緝獲”二字，不是已經把店主當做盜賣私貨者了麼？他不是已成犯罪者了麼，其實那種雪茄，店主說在去年時候，明明是由跑街兜售上來的，他們並且送有烟盤一隻，給擺在櫃臺上做廣告，明明是可以公開賣買的。倘使這種雪茄是須查禁的話，何以不查禁之於當時？而查禁之於現在？烟，是由一家香烟公司製造出來的，查騐者何以不查禁之於烟公司，而竟查禁於受賣者呢？倘使烟公司已經停閉的話，那末查騐所應公告各店戶禁銷此種烟類，何必用這種迅雷不及掩耳的手段，然後加人以“緝獲”的惡名？</p>
<p>是的，這種行動，在查騐所方面，是依照定章，公事公辦，然而那里知道小商人們大多是朦於時事，因之不知就裹，大受其冤屈的！倘使總查騐所訊問之後，因店主並無金錢而判令罰鍰幾十元的話時，那不是更累死他了麼？</p>
<p>同時，閘北一帶小商人受查騐而受同樣痛苦的，不止一家，其中固然有明知故犯，罪有應得的，可是像上述的受其冤屈的，亦當不止一家，他們不能說，也無處可說，筆者愛政府愛同行情深，特草草將此隱情瀝陳於此，尚希當局得此隱情之後，體念小商人之艱苦，予以憐恤，對於諸如此類之事加以改善，而甦民困為幸！</p>

Over five hundred military and political figures, including He Chengjun, welcomed them at the station. He and Gu disembarked, had lunch, and had a long conversation with He Chengjun until 11:30 AM. They then, along with Lin Weiwen, Chen Wenxin, He Jingwu, and Liu Hangchen, a representative of Liu Xiang, boarded three aircraft to head west. He told reporters that military reorganization is a demand of all national soldiers and brooks no delay. This time, he is entering Sichuan to preside over the military reorganization conference, and will return east in about a week. Gu said that he would remain in Sichuan temporarily after the military reorganization conference. He has not been to Wuhan for five years and expressed his gratification upon hearing of the progress in Wuhan's construction. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Lushan Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs, along with Director Gu Zhutong, arrived in Lushan on the 3rd and have twice met with Chairman Chiang to seek instructions on the reorganization of Sichuan-Xikang military affairs. Chairman Chiang gave detailed instructions. Now that the matter is concluded, they left the mountain for Xun on the morning of the 5th around 7:00 AM, accompanied by Secretary Xie Zhongyuan and others. He and Gu then took a plane from Xun to Hankou to meet Liu Hangchen, a representative of Liu Xiang who was waiting in Hankou, and flew to Chongqing, estimated to arrive around 4:00 PM in the afternoon. As for Liu Xiang, he had already left Chengdu for Chongqing on the 4th to welcome He and Gu. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Chongqing] He Yingqin and Gu Zhutong flew to Chongqing at 1:30 PM on the afternoon of the 5th. He Guoguang, Xia Douyin, Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, Yang Sen, etc., and heads and representatives of various organizations, approximately over a thousand people, lined up at the Shanhu Dam airfield to welcome them. After He and Gu disembarked, they shook hands and exchanged greetings with He Guoguang and others. He Guoguang then separately introduced the members of the reorganization committee to He, who shook hands and expressed his thanks to each of them. They then took a motorboat across the river, transferred to the "Shanghai" and landed, and then took a car to Gu's residence at Fanzhuang to rest. After a meal, Deng Hanxiang and Liu Hangchen, representing Liu Xiang, went to pay their respects and convey their welcome. Soon after, the reorganization committee members also successively paid their respects to He. At 8:00 PM, He met with Liu Xiang, chairman of Sichuan, who had just arrived in Chongqing from Chengdu, and various reorganization committee members to discuss everything.

On the morning of the 5th, he dispatched Deng to Chongqing first to represent him in welcoming Minister He. He himself made many stops to inspect the disaster situation and official governance along the way, and only arrived in Chongqing at 5:00 PM in the afternoon. He Guoguang, Xia Douyin, Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, Yang Sen, Sun Zhen, Li Jiayu, Tang Shizun, Wang Zanxu, Fan Shaozeng, Xu Shaozong, Guo Xunqi, Zhang Bangben, Zhou Hunyuan, and heads and representatives of various organizations all welcomed him at Hualongqiao, more than thirty li from the city.

At 8:00 PM, he went to Fanzhuang to pay his respects to Minister He to report on matters. After Liu arrived in Chongqing, reporters went to Liu's private residence to pay their respects. Liu, saying he was still weary from the journey, sent the director of the Department of Finance, Liu Hangchen, to meet them instead. According to what was discussed, Chairman Liu has resolved to absolutely obey the central government's military reorganization measures. Information regarding the conference and the finalized plan has already been reported in the newspapers. The undetermined steps must await Chairman Liu's consultations with Minister He and Director Gu before they can be announced. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>He Issues Written Statement</p>
<p>[Chongqing] Minister He arrived in Chongqing at 1:30 PM on the afternoon of the 5th. Reporters went to visit him at the airfield and were given a written statement, as follows: "Director Gu and I have been ordered to come to Sichuan to work with Director Liu and the generals of Sichuan and Xikang to handle the military reorganization of Sichuan and Xikang. Today, we arrived in Chongqing by plane and were warmly welcomed by the generals and various sectors of Chongqing. We are very honored and very grateful. I visited Chongqing twenty years ago. This time, I have returned and have seen great progress in the construction of Chongqing, and the situation is extremely vigorous. Although I have only seen one place, it is enough to prove the efforts of all the compatriots in Sichuan under the leadership of Chairman Liu in recent years. Not only is there much expression in material construction, but there is also very rapid progress in the spiritual aspect. In recent years, when I was in Nanjing, I often received letters from many Sichuan friends and often came into contact with many Sichuan youths. I felt that their thinking was very progressive and that everything was premised on the interests of the nation and the people, and not, as in the past, putting Sichuan first and the nation and the people second. In particular, the soldiers of Sichuan have made many contributions to the Party and the country in recent years and have made their best efforts for the work of saving the country and building the country. This is what I feel very admired and very happy about. Regarding the issue of military reorganization, the military reorganization plan has already been decided by the central government and telegraphed to Director Liu and the generals of Sichuan and Xikang. Director Liu and the generals have all telegraphed back to the central government, unanimously expressing their acceptance. My visit to Chongqing this time is only to discuss the methods and steps for implementing the military reorganization plan. Now, the whole country has a clear understanding of the matter of military reorganization, because in order to lay the foundation for national revival, the national army must be thoroughly reorganized. However, there are still a few people who think that military reorganization is military reduction, is reducing expenses, and is placing personnel from the central government. This, of course, is because they do not yet understand the meaning of military reorganization. In short, military reorganization is to enrich the quality of the army. Second, it is to unify the organization of the army in accordance with the organization stipulated by the central government to meet the needs of national defense and modern weapons and tactics. For example, the central government stipulates that the number of people in a division is 10,000, but the number of people in a general division is only a few thousand. It can be said that it takes two divisions to form one division as stipulated by the central government. Therefore, although the large unit is reduced a bit, the actual number of people has not decreased, and the combat power has greatly increased, and command and use are especially agile and flexible. Second, the expenses are reorganized based on the original expenses and are not reduced by a single point. However, after reorganization according to the central government's plan, the treatment of officers and soldiers can be improved, and they can be paid according to the National Crisis Allowance Regulations. Third, personnel are handled entirely in accordance with personnel regulations, so that officers and soldiers are guaranteed. After the reorganization, if there are a small number of surplus officers, they will be arranged in accordance with the methods of reorganizing the divisions in the 25th year, or they will be assigned as aides to various troops, or they will be sent to military schools for advanced studies. The central government does not arrange people down separately. The only difference between the army after reorganization and before is that after the reorganization, all organization, personnel, expenses, education, etc. are directly under the central government, and everything is handled in accordance with regulations, and all become a real national army. Therefore, military reorganization is definitely not the so-called reduction and reorganization of the past. As for the military reorganization principles stipulated by the central government, they are all determined according to the needs of the country. All armies that should be reorganized are handled in accordance with this principle, and it is not determined for the reorganization of the Sichuan-Xikang army. Moreover, this time the reorganization of the Sichuan-Xikang army is entirely to resolve the difficulties in Sichuan. Because the current situation of the Sichuan army and finance is such that if it is not reorganized, it will only tend to be in a state of crisis. Therefore, the central government presides over the reorganization of the Sichuan-Xikang army, which is really to help Chairman Liu complete the aspirations of building Sichuan, to help all the officers and men of Sichuan and Xikang reduce their current difficulties, and there is absolutely no personal prejudice mixed in it. This can be proven by facts. It is hoped that all the comrades in Sichuan and Xikang and all the people in Sichuan will have a clearer understanding of this military reorganization and will unanimously cooperate and support it, so that the military reorganization can be completed quickly, which is not only the blessing of Sichuan but also the blessing of the entire nation and people. Finally, when reporters asked about the situation of Chairman Chiang's health and the reorganization of the former Northeast Army, etc., Minister He replied that Chairman Chiang's health has recently fully recovered. When I visited Chairman Chiang in Lushan this time, I saw that Chairman Chiang's spirit was as strong as ever. Today, Lushan held a memorial week, and Chairman Chiang also went to participate and gave a long speech. The reorganization of the former Northeast Army is progressing extremely smoothly. Now the reorganization has been completed one after another. Yang Hucheng's departure from the country is in accordance with the order of the central government to inspect military affairs. The army under his command has now been approved by the central government to be reorganized into two divisions and is still stationed in Shaanxi, actively training. Since Director Yu Hanmou took office in Guangdong, he has been determined to reorganize the army. This spring, he also voluntarily reduced more than 20 regiments to make military expenditures suitable. Therefore, the garrison in Guangdong Province is now completely on track. Director Li Zongren and Commissioner Bai Chongxi in Guangxi are all burying their heads in hard work for the reorganization of the army and the management of construction. Their enthusiasm for supporting the central government has even more practical expressions. Commissioner Bai will soon go north to visit Chairman Chiang. Although the situation in the north is often in a difficult situation, with the efforts of Director Song Zheyuan and the generals and local authorities, they can still support it with hardship and maintain stability. Their will is completely consistent with the central government. Under the leadership of Chairman Long in Yunnan, all construction and politics have made greater progress than before. I also wanted to go to Yunnan this time to see, but because I am busy in Nanjing, I don't know if I can spare the time. Guizhou Province has been hit hard by drought this year, and now it is actively providing relief by raising funds separately inside and outside the province. If time permits, I also plan to go to Guiyang after the meeting in Chongqing, because I have been away from Guiyang for more than ten years. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Li Shouxin was once under surveillance by a certain party. In order to gain the trust of others, Li strangled his wife, Zhang, to death with a rope, because his wife often traveled between Beiping and Tianjin, and the party became suspicious. The six soldiers who were monitoring Li were only withdrawn at the end of last month. Recently, one regiment of puppet Mongolian troops each has been opened up in Shangdu and Jiabusi. The situation in Shangdu is still extremely chaotic. Small groups of people and armed groups from various places in eastern and northern Chahar have joined the Self-Defense Army.

<h3>Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar Narrowly Escapes Assassination</h3>
<p>Bomb Explodes in Front of Church Door. Flying Street Stones, He Is Fortunately Unharmed</p>
<p>⊙Lisbon Someone attempted to assassinate Prime Minister Salazar this morning, but failed. The Prime Minister goes to the church in the private residence of his friend Dr. Tocos every Sunday morning to attend Mass. This morning, the Prime Minister went as usual. When his car arrived in front of Dr. Tocos's private residence, the Prime Minister got out of the car and was about to enter when a huge bomb suddenly exploded in front of the door. A large piece of street stone flew up with a roar and fell several steps away. The glass windows of nearby houses were also shattered, but Prime Minister Salazar was safe and sound. He immediately walked into Tocos's home. Regarding this case, the police authorities have launched an investigation and discovered that the bomb was placed in the ditch in front of Tocos's door, one meter from the ground, and its explosion was powered by electricity. The explosive force was extremely fierce, and it was fortunate that the Prime Minister was unharmed. At present, the situation in the city is as peaceful as usual, and the streets are bustling with pedestrians, no different from a normal Sunday. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Details of the Incident</p>
<p>The police investigation revealed the following details of the incident:</p>
<p>The night before, a car with its front and rear lights off stopped near Dr. Tocos's residence. There were several unidentified people in the car. They probably took advantage of the night to secretly place the bomb in the ditch and used a long wire to wind along the ditch underground to the corner of "October 5th" Street, 50 meters away. Until yesterday morning, two assassins, one waited at the corner of "October 5th" Street, and the other spied near Dr. Tocos's residence. As soon as Prime Minister Salazar's car arrived in front of Dr. Tocos's residence, they sent a signal, and their accomplices immediately pulled the rope, and the bomb exploded. At that time, the Prime Minister was about to get out of the car and was unharmed. His confidential secretary was also in the car, but was only covered in mud and was not injured. It can be said to be fortunate. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Salazar's Brief Biography</p>
<p>Salazar is 46 years old. He first served as Minister of Finance for four years, and in 1932 he also took over the position of Prime Minister. Salazar is one of the most incredible figures in European politics. He is a devout Catholic and believes that God has ordered him to save the country from its difficulties. His rule is authoritarian, so he is actually the dictator of Portugal. Portugal's finances were chaotic, but after Salazar took over the Ministry of Finance, he was able to create a balanced budget and implement the administrative plan laid down by the Marquis of Pombal 200 years ago after the great earthquake in Lisbon. Portuguese politics then gradually got on the right track, so Salazar has the reputation of "Savior of Portugal". (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>Situation in Palestine Perilous</h3>
<p>British Navy and Air Force Sent to Suppress</p>
<p>[London] Fearing that incidents may occur in Palestine after the publication of the Palestine Committee's report, the authorities today specially ordered the battlecruiser "Repulse" to sail from Malta to Haifa. According to information from well-informed Jewish sources in London, the committee's report advocates dividing Palestine into three parts: a Jewish state, an Arab state, and a British trusteeship area. The "Repulse" has a displacement of 32,000 tons and is equipped with six 15-inch guns. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>⊙Jerusalem The report of the British Committee on Palestine is about to be released, and the local situation is very dangerous, with the possibility of bloodshed. The British government has dispatched the destroyer "Resistance" and a squadron of fighter planes from Malta to the port of Haifa in Palestine to suppress it. The area has been uneasy since the end of last week. The mayor of Bethlehem, Bondac, opposes the Arab people and has narrowly escaped assassination four times recently. His residence has also been shot at, and his wife, daughters, and servants have been injured. At the same time, it is learned that Hussein, the leader of the Arab Nationalist Party, has gone to Syria to mobilize Arabs for support. There are about 7,000 British troops stationed here, preparing to prevent conflicts between Arabs and Jews. The British Committee was established in November last year, originally to establish a Jewish state in Palestine based on the promise of former British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour in 1918. Its report will be submitted to the League of Nations Mandate Commission. The Arab National United Front has shown signs of division tonight, and the release of the British Committee's report may cause serious disputes. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>

The authorities immediately issued a warning and used searchlights to scan it, and used anti-aircraft guns to bombard it. The planes were therefore unable to exert their power, and dropped a total of about 50 large bombs, all of which fell in the fields in the suburbs. A part of the city was shaken by it. The intensity of this air raid was rare, but the damage was not significant. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Inspection Group Arrives in England from Germany</h3>
<p>[London] The Japanese business inspection group led by Tokyo Chamber of Commerce President Kado, Shigekuro, arrived here this afternoon from Germany. The group includes 24 important Japanese industrialists and bankers.

The Japanese inspection group is scheduled to hold a two-day meeting with the Federation of British Industries starting this Thursday. It is not yet known what proposals the Japanese side has, but it is generally believed that the Japanese side will ask the British to slightly relax their restrictions on Japanese business in the colonies, in return for the cession of trade rights in China. The extent to which the proposals of this inspection group are related to negotiations between the British and Japanese governments is of great concern to the general public.

<h3>Hopes for the Female Aviator Persist</h3>
<p>Signals Received in San Francisco, Now There Are Clues to Follow</p>
<p>⊙San Francisco At 1:00 PM today (Greenwich Mean Time), the radio station of the Pan American Airways in Honolulu sent out a broadcast telegram to the famous American aviator Amelia Earhart, who went missing in the Pacific. At 1:15, the station received a radio signal from the southeast of Howland Island, which seemed to be sent by Ms. Earhart's plane, but it was weak and difficult to identify. The coast guard ship "Itasca" immediately rushed to the area. The general opinion is that this signal may have been sent by other radio stations trying to communicate with Ms. Earhart, but the Pan American Airways still believes that it was sent by Ms. Earhart's plane. The radio generator installed in Ms. Earhart's plane is powered by an engine and cannot be used after landing, so some people think that the plane may have landed on a coral island in the Pacific. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>⊙Los Angeles The coastal patrol ship "Itasca" patrolled the waters around Howland Island today, but did not find any trace of the plane piloted by Ms. Earhart and her companion Noonan. The US Navy Department is now making every effort to find the plane. The battleship "Colorado" sailed out of Honolulu yesterday afternoon, heading towards Howland Island at full speed, and is expected to arrive on Tuesday night. The ship has three planes on board, one of which flew in front of the ship to search, but returned to Honolulu due to wind and rain. The aircraft carrier "Lexington" is carrying 54 aircraft, and sailed from California to Howland Island last night, accompanied by four destroyers. Although the weather between Honolulu and Howland Island is currently bad, it is heard that the skies near Howland Island are mostly cloudy and there is a light breeze. If the lady's plane is floating on the sea or staying on a distant reef, then this kind of weather is particularly favorable. Ms. Earhart's husband, Putnam, told people that his wife intended to make this flight across the Pacific her last transoceanic flight, and then the couple would settle down at home. If this flight is safely returned, then all the oceans of the world will have been flown over. His wife has always had the ambition to fly around the world, and will not be able to settle down until she has fulfilled this wish. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 4th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs</p>
<h3>Commentary on the Revised Implementation Rules of the Publication Law</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>Our country's current Publication Law was promulgated in November of last year. Because the old implementation rules of the law had become ineffective, the new Publication Law has not yet come into effect in reality. According to a special dispatch in this newspaper on the 3rd of this month, the Ministry of the Interior has formulated twenty-eight new implementation rules for the Publication Law, which have been passed by the Executive Yuan and, after some textual refinement, will be promulgated and implemented. The two most important points in the detailed rules are the regulation of the minimum capital amount for the establishment of newspapers and news agencies, and the minimum educational level of newspaper publishers. Within six months, all registered newspapers must supplement their capital registration. Those newspapers with insufficient capital will inevitably be eliminated. If this leads to the result of removing the inferior and preserving the superior, emphasizing quality over quantity, it is certainly what we very much hope for.</p>
<p>The purpose of the new Publication Law and its implementation rules is nothing more than to guide the newspaper industry onto a rational path under the leadership of the central government. The legislative intention is not objectionable. Its method is: first, publication registration, so that publications deemed unnecessary by the government have no possibility of being born; second, restrictions on what is printed, so that publications that have already been born can follow the rules and regulations in their reporting and speech to meet the needs of the country and not stray from the correct path of public opinion. The second task is accomplished by the news censorship system, which the government can exercise at any time. The first task was not clearly stipulated in the old Publication Law. The new Publication Law has stricter regulations. When applying for registration, the organizational structure, capital amount, and economic situation of each newspaper must be stated. There are also various restrictions on the qualifications of the publisher. However, when reviewing the registration form, how much capital is considered qualified, and what level of education the publisher must have, are not stipulated in the Publication Law. The implementation rules provide detailed answers to these two questions.</p>
<p>According to our newspaper's report on the 3rd, the minimum capital for newspapers published in cities with a population of one million or more is 10,000 yuan, and for issuing news dispatches, the minimum capital is 3,000 yuan. In cities below one million in population where the provincial or municipal government is located, the capital for publishing newspapers is at least 6,000 yuan, and for news agencies, 1,000 yuan. In county government seats, the capital for newspapers is 1,000 yuan, and for news agencies, 200 yuan. Publishers of newspapers and issuers of news dispatches must have one of the following qualifications: graduation from a university or junior college, graduation from a high school with more than three years of experience in running a newspaper, having served in a news affairs regulatory agency for more than three years, or having five years of experience in running a newspaper. These regulations are intended to solidify the economic foundation of newspapers and raise the knowledge standards of those in charge, so that mediocre newspapers and reporters have no place in the sacred realm of public opinion.</p>
<p>Of course, these restrictions are not strict compared to those in Europe and Japan. In Japan, newspapers in Tokyo and Osaka must pay a deposit of 2,000 yuan before publishing. If there is a violation of the law, the government will deduct the fine from this amount. The German Newspaper Law stipulates that those who have not received specialized training and do not have the ability to express public opinion cannot obtain the qualification of a journalist. At the same time, there are too many unsound newspapers and news agencies in the Chinese press. Due to the unsound economic foundation, they often resort to subsidies and other methods that damage their reputation for survival, thereby degrading the quality of the newspaper. Due to the unlimited qualifications of journalists, there are often those with no social science knowledge, no vocational training, and therefore no sound professional ethics or sense of responsibility who infiltrate the newspaper industry. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in the interior. The provisions of the Publication Law implementation rules are necessary to rectify the newspaper industry and raise standards.</p>
<p>However, our government and the press should pay attention to the following: First, the Chinese newspaper industry is still in its early stages compared to Europe and the United States. In this period, we cannot be too strict in our requirements for capital and talent. In the past, there have often been extraordinary people who, without sufficient financial resources or specialized training, relied solely on their creative genius and personal perseverance to work hard in the newspaper industry and achieve success. For example, Benjamin Franklin in the United States rose from a printer to a master of public opinion, and Bernard founded New York's most successful newspaper with a capital of 500 yuan. The achievements of the predecessors can serve as a model. Now that newspapers have developed printing technology and specialized content, they cannot do without large capital and specialized talents. However, compared to other commercial and cultural undertakings, the possibility of risk is greater. If the legal restrictions are too strict, young people with aspirations to start a business will only sigh in vain, and the wealthy class and commercial forces will inevitably infiltrate the realm of public opinion, causing the newspaper industry to lose its spirit of autonomy and independence.</p>
<p>Second, the provisions of the Publication Law and its implementation rules are all negative restrictions. While removing the inferior and eliminating the weak can provide opportunities for the good and the strong to develop, the future remains uncertain if the government does not provide active support to China's nascent newspaper industry. It is beyond the means of graduates of high schools and universities with ten thousand gold pieces to start a newspaper in large cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin. The high cost of daily raw materials such as paper and ink, and the fierce competition, often make it difficult for newspapers to survive on their own. Therefore, the government and the press should actively work to overcome economic difficulties, strengthen solidarity within the industry, raise standards, enforce discipline, and train talent. Otherwise, relying solely on the negative work of the law will not enable the Chinese newspaper industry to reach a path of prosperity.</p>

<h3>Hirota Seeks to Unify the National Diplomatic Front</h3>
<p>Not Using Policies as Tools for Political Strife; The Policy Towards China and Russia Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Since taking office, Foreign Minister Hirota has been attempting to establish a unified national diplomacy. As a result of consultations with Prime Minister Konoe, he has requested the assistance of the military, the House of Peers, both political parties, and the people of the entire country. Hirota himself has exchanged views with various parties and has seen its effectiveness. According to Foreign Minister Hirota's diplomatic policy, he places his emphasis on the following two points: ㊀ Foreign policy should not be changed due to changes in domestic political conditions; ㊁ Unify external diplomatic functions and seek to strengthen them; ㊂ Do not use foreign policy as a tool for domestic political strife. The Foreign Minister intends to strengthen the foundation of national diplomacy based on these three principles. If this plan is realized, Japan's foreign policy, centered on diplomacy towards China and Russia, will not undergo any changes for the time being. The Foreign Minister recently met with Ogawa Gotaro of the Minseito Party, Matsuno Tsuruhei of the Seiyukai Party, and Nakano Seigo, among others, and has received expressions of sympathy. He is also scheduled to meet with Kiyose Ichiro of the Kokumin Domei in the coming days to exchange views. (Allied Press, 5th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Concern Over Trade Situation</h3>
<p>How to Reverse the Adverse Trend is a Serious Problem Currently</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The general public here has expressed unusual concern about Japan's international trade situation in the second half of this year. Traditionally, the second half of each year is a period of export surplus. However, observers have differing opinions on the extent of the export surplus in the second half of this year. In order to maintain balance of international payments, Japan has already shipped gold abroad five times in the first half of this year, totaling 270 million yen. It is now preparing to ship gold abroad for the sixth time, with an amount of approximately 40-50 million yen. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance is now planning to set the gold reserve of the Bank of Japan at 425 million yen. All gold exceeding this limit may be transported to foreign countries by the Bank of Japan. This year, the gold reserve has consistently been around 524.7 million yen. According to a published announcement today, the bank's reserve on July 3rd decreased by 5.3003 million yuan due to the shipment of gold to New York. Furthermore, financial circles estimate that within the next three years, Japan will experience a continuous import surplus as a result of expanding production capacity and strengthening military preparedness. Even if the amount of gold exported abroad each year is limited to 350 million yuan, the total amount of gold exported in three years will inevitably reach 1.05 billion yuan. Moreover, this estimate is only the minimum. If the trade situation continues to reverse, it will be necessary to export even more gold. Therefore, how to increase gold production and how to reverse the adverse trend of international trade are both serious problems currently facing Japan.

<h3>It's Like a Funny Play; The Landless Gypsy Nation Crowns a New King</h3>
<p>A Tinker Ascends a Gilded Throne; Twenty-one Firecrackers Serve as a Salvo; Plans to Seek Land in Abyssinia to Build a Nation</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw The Gypsy nation recently held a congress of representatives at the army sports ground here, electing Janusz Kwiek as the King of all Gypsies in the world, and crowning him. The wife of the Polish Prime Minister, Mr. Składkowski, and many Polish dignitaries were present to watch. According to the traditional rules of the Gypsy nation, the voters should be thirty "elders," but thirteen abstained, so only seventeen participated in the vote. These people were all wearing patched silk and ink ceremonial robes, or top hats, or fedoras. After the election results were announced, the Greek Orthodox Bishop Dwolowicz of Warsaw crowned King Janusz. The crown was made of copper, gilded with gold. The Bishop then presented King Janusz with a scepter and placed a large blue cape on him. The cape was trimmed with silver rats and embroidered with lilies. It was borrowed from the Warsaw Municipal Theater, used in the performance of Shakespeare's tragedy "King Lear." Other items, such as tables, chair pads, and carpets, were also borrowed from the theater. The table was made of cardboard, and the chairs were also gilded, serving as real seats. After the coronation ceremony, twenty-one firecrackers were set off to serve as a salute. The seventeen "elders" all knelt before the King and kissed his hand to show their loyalty. A group of "princes" in ragged clothes, followed by many attendants in theatrical costumes, expressed their loyalty to the new King. The new King then issued a declaration, stating, "I am always concerned about the interests of Poland, just as I am concerned about the interests of my people. Long live Poland, Long live President Mościcki, Long live the Polish Army and its leader General Rydz-Śmigły!" The new King also told the press that he would find land for the Gypsy nation to build a country and would ask the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request the League of Nations to help. He would also visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, asking him to allow land to be carved out in Abyssinia for the Gypsy nation to live on. The new King has three adult sons, two of whom are currently engaged in the profession of making pots with the new King, so the succession to the throne should not be a problem.

<p>⊙Warsaw Today, the European Gypsy nation held a congress of representatives here and held the coronation ceremony of the Gypsy King. Unexpectedly, after the new King Janusz Kwiek was crowned, a brawl broke out in the crowd, killing ten people and injuring twenty. It was found that Janusz Kwiek was a wandering tinker. The cause of the brawl was due to the new King's opponents making disrespectful slanders against him. When the coronation ceremony was held today, there were 5,000 representatives in attendance. The new King will soon go to Rome to visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. It is said that Mussolini has agreed to open up an area in Abyssinia for the Gypsy nation as the territory of the Gypsies. It is also heard that the new King intends to raise this issue to the League of Nations. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 4th)</p>

<h3>A Certain Party Determined to Protect the Pseudo-Organizations of Chahar and Hebei with Force</h3>
<p>The Air Force Threatens Sui and Jin; The Navy Oppresses Ping and Tianjin; Fifty Aircraft from Changchun Arrive in Chengde for Standby</p>
<p>Zhangbei Correspondence: During the period when the People's Self-Defense Army rose up actively, the puppet army in northern Chahar has been indirectly obstructing the issue of advancing westward. The reason is due to the restraining force of the People's Self-Defense Army, but also because the behind-the-scenes manipulators have concerns and other intentions. Although they had previously expressed to the two traitors, De Wang and Li Shouxin, that they should quickly determine methods to suppress or appease the People's Army, or quickly determine a plan to advance westward or southward, this was merely an expression of anger, suddenly revealed in their words. The truth is that their domestic political situation is unstable, and their foreign policy has not been determined, so they have no choice but to wait patiently. Recently, their policy towards China has been decided to continue to be implemented based on the three principles, and the main plan for the puppet army in northern Chahar has been determined accordingly.</p>
<p>Determined to Maintain the Established Facts by Force</p>
<p>According to sources from a certain related party, the certain party has now decided to maintain all the special facts that have been established in North China by means of armed threats. If necessary, the air force will be the main force to threaten the authorities of Suiyuan and Shanxi, and protect the existence of the rebellious group in northern Chahar. As for eastern Hebei, a large number of naval warships will sail along the coastal areas of Qinhuangdao and Dagu, in order to threaten the authorities of Ping, Tianjin, and Hebei Province, and protect the existence of the pseudo-organization in eastern Hebei. According to a message from a certain special agency on the 2nd of this month, more than 50 fighter planes, bombers, and reconnaissance planes have now been transferred from Changchun to Chengde for standby. As for the puppet army in Rehe, they are currently moving westward to prepare for any eventuality.</p>
<p>Armed Secret Agents of Bandits and Puppets are Densely Deployed in Chahar and Suiyuan</p>
<p>Recently, the bandit and puppet army in northern Chahar secretly dispatched about 200 armed secret agents from Zhangbei, Shangdu, and other places, densely deploying them on the eastern border of Suiyuan and in various places north of Chahar Province. Their purpose is to gather information on the military and political situation of our country and the activities of the People's Self-Defense Army, and report to the special agencies at any time. If necessary, they may take the opportunity to disrupt the local public order. In addition, a certain party is also adopting the old tactics of the Soviet Union, using beautiful Korean women or young Chinese women as honey trap spies. It is said that the organization of these honey trap spy agencies selects 30 beautiful and vicious young women to form a group, with a group leader, deputy group leader, and secretary each. They are now active in Ping, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, and other places, mostly mixing in brothels or disguising themselves as waitresses in hotels and restaurants, using their beauty to seduce and detect secrets. As for male spies, 14 people form a group, and the organization is the same as that of the women, but the treatment is slightly different.</p>
<p>Activities of the People's Self-Defense Army</p>
<p>According to a person from Kangbao County, on June 28th, Zhang Ying, who had previously served as the director of the Public Security Bureau of a certain county, secretly joined forces with more than 200 comrades to occupy Kangbao in response to the atrocities of a certain party and the bandits and puppets, due to his anger at their actions. However, because there were so few people and there was no support, they once fiercely attacked the county seat, but were immediately defeated. Seven people were killed by the puppet army, and three were captured alive. More than ten horses of the bandits and puppets were obtained. Zhang Ying then led the remaining people to flee and is now joining forces with Zhang Zhongying, waiting for an opportunity to rise again. It is also heard that Zhang Zhongying's troops also launched two consecutive attacks on the puppet army on the 28th of last month in the vicinity of the Continental Company, 40 li northwest of Shangdu. The first time, they obtained 70-80 war horses, and the second time, they obtained 46 horses. Zhang Zhongying is still in the vicinity of Xinghe. As for Li Ying and Liang Pin, etc., they are all preparing or engaging in guerrilla warfare.</p>
<h3>A Certain Party Secretly Recruiting Chinese Laborers in Southern Fujian to Go Beyond the Pass</h3>
<p>Falsely Claiming to Go to Singapore to Cultivate Rubber Plantations; Recruitment Halted After Being Discovered</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Everyone knows about the deceptive and cruel tactics used by a certain party in recruiting Chinese laborers in North China to go beyond the Pass. The floating corpses in Tianjin and Dagu are clear evidence of this. Therefore, few have applied in recent days, and they have felt the difficulty. Therefore, they have turned to South China, especially paying attention to southern Fujian, which has a large number of Chinese laborers going abroad to Southeast Asia every year. According to reports here, "Recently, hundreds of strong men have been recruited from Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Shima, and other places to go beyond the Pass. According to investigations, two batches were assigned to a certain country's ship to Hong Kong in June. The first batch was 300 people, mostly from Zhangzhou and Shima. The second batch was more than 100 people, from Xiamen and Shima, mostly laborers and coolies. The persons responsible for recruiting in Xiamen were Chen and Yang, and in Shima, one or two baojia chiefs were bought as their accomplices to carry out the recruitment, which was extremely secretive. They falsely claimed that they were recruiting people to go to Singapore to cultivate rubber plantations. Most of the applicants were ignorant and shallow. After the negotiations were successful, they were threatened in various ways and were not allowed to reveal anything, otherwise they would be dealt with severely. Therefore, few people outside knew about it. Each person was given a family allowance of 10 yuan before departure. In fact, both batches went to Dalian beyond the Pass after transferring ships in Hong Kong. The certain country people used the psychology of the people in southern Fujian, falsely claiming to hire them to work in Southeast Asia. Few were not deceived by them. It was originally planned to recruit a large number of people to continue, but later, the person who was recruiting in Shima on their behalf was discovered by the authorities and arrested and sent to the province. Seeing that they had suffered a setback, the certain country has stopped recruiting in recent days." It should be noted that the psychology of the people in southern Fujian seeking employment overseas has a historical background. Few with lofty ambitions do not hope to go abroad. The British Malaya has a monthly limit of 6,000 Chinese laborers entering the ports of Singapore and Penang. Xiamen can be allocated 1,800 exits per month. Because there are few quotas and many people, a registration and lottery method is used. Those who win the lottery can purchase ship tickets to go abroad. As of the end of June, as many as 6,000 people have registered but did not win the lottery, so they could not make the trip. A certain party took advantage of their psychology and was able to succeed. (July 4th)</p>
<h3>The Actual Situation of Disaster in Various Counties of Gansu (Continued)</h3>
<p>And the Tragic Situation Desperately Awaiting Relief</p>
<p>㊁ Previously issued relief funds for bandit disasters in various counties: During the summer and autumn of the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936], the disaster victims in various counties in eastern, western, and southern Gansu were in dire need of assistance. 3,000 yuan was allocated from the disaster relief reserve fund, along with the remaining 61,000 yuan from the central government's previous allocation of public bonds for disaster relief in the twelve counties of Hexi, and 40,000 yuan allocated from the provincial treasury, totaling 105,000 yuan. Of this, 3,000 yuan was allocated to Zhengning and Heshui counties to establish refugee shelters, 4,500 yuan to Linxia and Zhenyuan counties and the former provincial capital's Public Security Bureau for accommodating and repatriating refugees fleeing banditry from neighboring counties, and 6,500 yuan to Huating, Xihe, Kangle, and Tianshui counties for relief from hailstorm and earthquake disasters. The remaining relief funds, totaling 91,000 yuan, were distributed to Qingyang, Guyuan, Haiyuan, Huanxian, Minxian, Lintan, Weiyuan, Zhangxian, Lintao, Longxi, Huixian, Chengxian, Kangxian, Liangdang, Tongwei, Huining, Kangle, Jingyuan, Wushan, Dingxi, Lixian, Xihe, Longde, Jingning, Gangu, Jingtai, Zhuanglang, and Gulang counties, as well as disaster victims in the ten villages of Nalang under the jurisdiction of Yang Jiqing, the security commander of the Tao-Min Road. According to Article 15 of the Central Relief Commission's investigation and distribution regulations, each person was given one yuan, so only 91,000 people could be assisted.</p>
<p>㊂ Currently issued relief funds for bandit disasters in various counties: In the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936], a total of 58 counties in the province were affected by bandit disasters. Among these, 30 counties were severely affected, with a total of 2,400,222 disaster victims. Fifteen counties were moderately affected, with 366,392 disaster victims. Thirteen counties were relatively affected, with 263,709 disaster victims. In total, there were 3,032,323 disaster victims. The central government specially allocated 300,000 yuan in public bonds, equivalent to 200,816.3 yuan in legal tender. Subsequently, two additional allocations of 100,000 yuan each were made in cash, totaling 400,816.3 yuan. In addition, the Executive Yuan sent Commissioner Du Yannian to Gansu to oversee the distribution. The Gansu Provincial Relief Association, in consultation with Commissioner Du, temporarily diverted 41,838.7 yuan from donations to orphanages, bringing the total to 450,000 yuan. In May of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], the provincial government approved the allocation of 433,500 yuan to the 58 counties, after deducting 16,500 yuan for relief to the five major monasteries of Song Kanbu and other relief efforts. Among these, 30 severely affected counties were allocated 331,500 yuan, 15 moderately affected counties were allocated 62,500 yuan, and 13 relatively affected counties were allocated 39,500 yuan. According to Article 15 of the Central Relief Commission's investigation and distribution regulations, each person was given one yuan, so only 433,500 people could be assisted.</p>
<p>In summary, the actual situation of the disaster is extremely serious. The total amount allocated before and after was 667,558.15 yuan. After deducting 38,558.15 yuan for operating disaster children's shelters, refugee shelters, and providing relief for hailstorm and earthquake disasters, the actual amount distributed to disaster victims was 629,000 yuan. According to Article 15 of the Central Relief Commission's investigation and distribution regulations, after distributing one yuan per person, only 629,000 people could be assisted, which is less than 22 percent of the total number of disaster victims. There are still over 2,403,300 disaster victims crying from hunger and cold, desperately awaiting food. The severity of the disaster exceeds that of other provinces. Currently, counties such as Minqin, Jiuquan, Jingtai, Zhangye, Anxi, and Jingchuan are sending telegrams requesting increased assistance due to the severity of the disaster and the scarcity of funds. Moreover, ten counties, including Tianshui, Gangu, Weiyuan, Longxi, Zhangxian, Huixian, Lintao, Jingchuan, Linze, and Jingyuan, have recently suffered again from natural disasters such as hailstorms, black frost, and sandstorms, and are also urgently requesting relief. Although the Farmers Bank is allocating 500,000 yuan to actively implement rural loans, this can only help a few counties whose residents are capable of engaging in production. As for the poor and helpless disaster victims who are displaced, they rely on grass roots and tree bark to prolong their lives, and deaths due to lack of grass roots and tree bark are heard of every day. Seeing the pitiful remnants of humanity is heartbreaking. The situation is compelling, and continuing emergency relief is a truly urgent matter. Some believe that with the recent rains in various counties, a harvest can be expected, and emergency relief is unnecessary. However, after a severe disaster, many farming tools are lost, and spring plowing is impossible. Replanting is already delayed, and it is difficult to expect a livelihood without providing rapid relief. Therefore, the Department of Civil Affairs convened a meeting to plan the second phase of emergency relief. Regarding the methods of raising relief funds, the meeting resolved that: ㊀ The provincial treasury should allocate an appropriate amount. ㊁ A detailed report on the disaster situation should be submitted to the central government requesting further large allocations. ㊂ An earnest appeal should be made to the provincial and municipal governments and various charitable organizations. ㊃ Overseas Chinese should be telegraphed to raise funds for assistance. ㊄ Leading figures from all sectors of the provincial capital should be asked to solicit donations from wealthy merchants. ㊅ Charitable performances or entertainment events should be held to raise funds. ㊆ A ratio for one-time donations from staff in all provincial agencies should be proposed and submitted to the Provincial Council for approval. From this, it can be seen that the disaster situation in Gansu Province must rely on collective wisdom and efforts, and multifaceted assistance, to be successfully resolved. Therefore, the actual situation of the disaster in various counties and the tragic situation awaiting relief are widely publicized to plead for the disaster victims. It is earnestly hoped that all charitable gentlemen and ladies will embrace compassion and generously donate, or engage in continuous fundraising, to save this great calamity. The urgency and eagerness to serve are beyond expression. (June 23rd)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Education Association Holds a Meeting to Reject Xiong</h3>
<p>Resolved to Issue a Declaration Rejecting Xiong and Petitioning Party and Government Agencies</p>
<p>Songjiang Correspondence: Since the news of the change of director of the local Education Bureau, colleagues in the education community have been deeply indignant at the appointment of Xiong Zhugao as the new director, due to his base character and notorious reputation. Yesterday, a general membership meeting was specially convened, attended by more than 300 people. The atmosphere at the meeting was unusually tense. The meeting unanimously passed a declaration rejecting Xiong, and elected more than 60 representatives to petition the county party headquarters and the county government. At the county party headquarters, Executive Committee member Sun Shiheng received them and promised to telegraph the provincial party headquarters, the provincial government, and the education department to request a remedy. The county government, due to County Magistrate Cao's absence, was received by Secretary Wang, but no satisfactory response was obtained. The representatives expressed deep dissatisfaction. Rumors suggest that the situation may escalate, which is truly unfortunate for the education community in Songjiang.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Education Association</p>
<p>Declaration of all members of the Songjiang County Education Association rejecting Xiong: The document states: The education in Songjiang has a long history of more than 30 years, from the late Qing Dynasty to the present. Especially in recent years, the progress of the education cause has been due to the appointment of capable directors. Moreover, Songjiang people have governed Songjiang, and never has talent been borrowed from other places. Now, Xiong Zhugao has come to lead the education in Songjiang, which has already been announced. An investigation reveals that Xiong is from Qingpu, and during his tenure as director of the Education Bureau in Jiangyin and Qingpu, he was driven out by the people due to his base character and notorious reputation. He has long been abandoned by his fellow villagers. The education in Songjiang has a long history and has achieved considerable results. It has been built up through painstaking efforts and only has what it has today. Even if Xiong shamelessly comes, the colleagues ask themselves: their character still exists, and they cannot bear to sit idly by and watch Songjiang education be ravaged by him. They vow to fight to the death and refuse to cooperate with him. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<p>Xiong Eager to Take Over</p>
<p>An investigation reveals that Chen Guisang, the director of the Songjiang Education Bureau, was transferred to Taicang by order of the department. After Xiong Zhugao was appointed to fill the vacancy, all sectors telegraphed the provincial department to retract the order. It is now heard that the new director has sent a letter to Director Chen, stating that he will arrive in Songjiang soon to take over the duties, and has expressed his intention to dismiss capable personnel in the existing bureau (see the original letter). According to the Regulations on the Protection of Education Personnel, this is clearly a violation. His future actions can be foreseen from this. The original letter, which has been obtained, is recorded below: (Omitted above) Time flies quickly. It has been three weeks since we parted in Jingjiang. Recently, I have been ending the past and preparing for the future, which must have been a lot of hard work. I have been transferred to your place, and the order has been received. I don't know if it has been delivered to your place yet. Please let me know when you are preparing to hand over the duties so that I can prepare. I heard that the chief of general affairs in Taicang has already resigned, the chief of school education has already taken a higher position, and one or two ordinary staff members have also left the bureau. I believe you will need some experienced personnel to assist you when you go there. Therefore, I dare not force the capable personnel in the Songjiang Bureau to stay and have already looked for suitable personnel to replace them. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>Wushen Highway Repaired</p>
<p>The Wuqing Highway from Wujin to Qingyang in Chengshu was completed last year and operated by the Shangban Wuqing Long-distance Bus Company. It was opened to traffic on October 15, which was convenient for passengers. However, the construction of the road was sloppy, and the pavement from Henglin to Qingyang was badly damaged, making it dangerous for vehicles to drive on. At the end of January of this year, it was stopped and workers were hired to repair it. Now, the section from Henglin to Yuqi in Xishu has been repaired and is open to traffic as usual. The section from Yuqi to Qingyang will also be repaired. In order to facilitate the travel of passengers between Xichang, the company has signed a cooperation agreement with the Xicheng Long-distance Bus Company.

<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Gradually Rising</p>
<p>Since the recent flood disaster in the four townships of Xiaoshan, all early rice is hopeless, and late rice is still being planted. Therefore, new rice from the townships cannot be marketed in time, and the source is lacking, causing supply to fall short of demand. The price of old rice has risen sharply. Since the 1st, the price of various grades of white rice has increased by 4 jiao, more than 1 yuan higher than in previous months. The price of white rice is more than 11 yuan per dan, and there are many buyers of wheat, rising from 5.1 yuan to 7.6 yuan. Demand exceeds supply, and the people's food is quite panicked.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>— Yu Hongjun</p>
<p>Mankind has two great enemies: disease and death. European and American medical experts and scientists, concerned with the welfare of the population, have devoted their lives to eradicating these two great enemies. Although death has not yet been conquered, since the rise of microbiology, the origins of diseases have been clearly recognized and extensively studied. With sophisticated methods of treatment and prevention, human lifespans have gradually increased, and the mortality rate has decreased year by year. Although there are occasional chapters in our country's classical texts on health preservation, they mostly consist of Daoist alchemists' discourses on personal cultivation, which are difficult to reconcile with today's hygiene, and even more difficult to reconcile with today's public health. After the Opium War, when the seas were opened and new knowledge was imported, the Chinese people gradually began to pay attention to cleanliness in their daily lives, but this was limited to individuals and seen in cities. There was no overall health administration plan. After the establishment of the Republic of China, internal wars continued. The officials of the Beijing government and the provinces had no time to pay attention to this. Since the Nationalist government established its capital in Nanjing, it recognized that the health of the people could not be ignored and that health administration could not be delayed. Therefore, central departments were established, bureaus were established in cities, and offices were established in counties to emphasize this matter. Thus, our country's health affairs had a unified responsible agency. In recent years, health undertakings have advanced rapidly, and the health of the people has become increasingly excellent, which is not without reason.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a thoroughfare for Chinese and foreign transportation, with a dense population and complex situation. It is the focus of attention. Health issues are the most important task of municipal administration. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of the municipal government, a health bureau was established to formulate health administration policies and implement them step by step. Over the years, although limited by funds, it has not been possible to fully realize every ideal, the establishment of epidemic prevention, the eradication of opium, and various other efforts to promote the health of citizens have been commended by society. The establishment and construction of municipal hospitals are all modern in scale. Now, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the municipal government, a health exhibition is being held and a special health publication is being printed. Everything that can be done to awaken citizens' awareness of health and instill health knowledge has been prepared. However, the purpose of the exhibition and the special publication is to contribute to citizens' relevant health knowledge, on the one hand, hoping that they will enjoy it as a right, and on the other hand, hoping that they will fulfill it as an obligation. "What is taken from the citizens is used for the citizens" is the basic principle of the municipal government and its affiliated agencies in serving the citizens. Therefore, from the perspective of pure municipal administration, the municipal government and all its facilities are for the enjoyment of the citizens as a right, and the various items related to health are especially important. However, from the perspective of national responsibility, if citizens have diseases that are not treated, have epidemics that are not prevented, or their behavior is harmful to public health, it will not only weaken personal physical strength but also hinder public health, and directly reduce national strength, which is contrary to the natural duty of citizens. Therefore, whether it is for rights, for obligations, for individuals, or for the country, our citizens should pay close attention to various health facilities, and strictly abide by various health rules, to help promote health administration. This is not for the municipal government, it is for the citizens themselves. It is not for the citizens themselves, it is for the entire nation. However, at present, the education of the people is not yet widespread, and the common sense of citizens has not yet reached a high level. It is feared that the significance of hygiene and its importance will be difficult to universally recognize. The duty of the municipal government's health bureau lies in intensifying efforts to promote health undertakings and instill health knowledge in urban and rural areas in the future, so that every citizen has a sound physique and a sound spirit. However, the subtle transformation and the establishment of customs still depend on the advocacy and promotion of insightful people. Therefore, the creation of this publication holds deep hopes for our enlightened citizens.</p>
<h3>The Significance of the Summer Hygiene Campaign</h3>
<p>— Jin Baoshan</p>
<p>The value of the summer hygiene campaign in terms of social education is immeasurable. Everyone acknowledges its contributions to the happiness and benefit of people's daily lives. Before and after the promotion of the summer hygiene campaign in our country, the general public's lack of and progress in health knowledge is obviously different. Previously, the public considered eliminating mosquitoes and flies to be an insignificant task. Since the advent of the hygiene campaign, many places have voluntarily organized campaigns to eliminate mosquitoes and flies. This can be seen from the records in the newspapers every summer. In addition, regarding vaccinations, such as typhoid and cholera vaccines, people have always adopted a wait-and-see or suspicious attitude. Since the advent of the summer hygiene campaign, the number of people voluntarily vaccinated in various places has gradually increased. Judging by the surge in the amount of typhoid and cholera vaccine used in recent years, it can be inferred that all of this shows the general public's increased knowledge of health education. At the same time, the only way for the government to promote public health programs is to rely on the summer hygiene campaign as a tool to convey its intentions so that the public can develop sympathy and acceptance. In this context, the summer hygiene campaign is like a major bridge, mediating between the public and the government. The first obstacle to establishing the foundation of public health is to enable the public to complete psychological construction, so that the public has a deep impression of public health in advance. However, this task cannot be solely borne by the public health program itself. Everything contained in the summer hygiene campaign, as well as its development in social education, conveniently and naturally shoulders this task and has already achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>Past summer hygiene campaigns (referring to the major cities in the country in general), in addition to standing on the above-mentioned position to fulfill their mission, have also grasped the actual needs, and then diseases will naturally decrease, and individuals will naturally be healthy. However, this purpose cannot be achieved in one place. The daily lives of the people have gradually tended towards a scientific level. The assistance it provides to the promotion of social culture should not be ignored. It seems that the summer hygiene campaign in the future needs to be even more advanced. Its activity should extend from the surface of society to the bottom of society, so that every family unit can be affected by the summer hygiene campaign, so that every housewife can acquire rich summer hygiene knowledge and manifest it in the handling of household affairs. The next summer hygiene campaign can be fully achieved only with the long-term efforts of the staff responsible for this campaign.</p>
<h3>Hygiene is Still For Yourself</h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>The two words "hygiene," in the eyes of the general public, seem to be a very profound, very complex, and very difficult-to-implement new field of knowledge. There is a concept of being too high to see and too lofty to climb. Moreover, some people misunderstand it, thinking that hygiene is the administration of the state, the facilities of society, and the cause of the masses, and that it has nothing to do with us individuals. In fact, these are all errors of thought and illusions of the mind.</p>
<p>Living beings all love life and hate death. Especially we humans, feeling the meaning of being human, the responsibility of being human, and the status of being human, naturally have the hope of cherishing our own lives and protecting our own bodies, and study various techniques of seeking good fortune and avoiding misfortune. Simply put, if you want to maintain the safety of your own life, you have to plan strategies for self-defense and resistance to insults. This strategy is naturally very complex, very broad, and very subtle. And hygiene is one of them.</p>
<p>I often say that the origin of hygienic thought is by no means man-made. It is inherent in living beings since they were born. However, without guidance, everyone does not understand avoidance. Without encountering harm, everyone does not pay attention. For example, in ancient times, in the era of Tang and Yu, if there were no traces of beasts and birds in China, there would be no attention to chasing away birds and beasts, and there would never have been the idea of using fire to benefit the palm and burning the mountains and swamps. Also, if there had been no floods that overflowed and flooded the world at that time, there would be no attention to preventing and controlling floods, and Yu would not have come up with the method of following the mountains and cutting the bases and establishing high mountains and great rivers. Therefore, harm is a dose of stimulant for everyone. People suffer pain before they can attract attention and realize that they have to study methods of coping and relief to achieve the purpose of self-defense and resistance to insults. Did Mencius not say, "A country constantly periled by external foes will survive?" This is the meaning.</p>
<p>From ancient times for thousands of years, we humans have suffered everything, and I don't know how much. Every time we suffer harm, we have one more lesson, which is also learning one more trick. In other words, taking a dose of stimulant brings a reaction, exciting us once, and further recognizing the effect of the stimulant. Therefore, we can say that today's hygienic methods are half the reaction of feeling the lessons of disease and half the manifestation of human reason. On the surface, it is for the sake of the happiness of the masses. In fact, the individual himself is a member of everyone, is he not for ourselves?</p>
<p>The significance of the hygiene campaign, according to what has been said above, is very clear, that is to say, to tell everyone the tricks learned from the lessons of harm suffered, and to guide everyone with the gains of human reason, a method of seeking good fortune and avoiding misfortune. If everyone can understand these many methods and put them into practice, not only can everyone get a safety, but the safety of the masses is our own safety. In turn, paying attention to hygiene and practicing hygiene still ends up being for ourselves.</p>
<p>Here, I can give a few practical examples for everyone to use as a reference for household hygiene. For example, red and white dysentery and cholera, which are common in summer and autumn, are now understood to be caused by dysentery bacteria, amoeba, and cholera bacteria. However, the most common method of transmission of dysentery and cholera bacteria, in addition to unclean water, is through the transmission of flies. Because flies often like to gather in dirty places and like to stop on food. Therefore, the dirt on their feet can be transmitted to our food, and the dirt on the food can enter our abdomen. Will we not get sick? But this fly does not recognize people. The food it stops on does not know who will eat it. If you let the flies go and do not dispose of them, you will always be carrying a lot of danger. Your family will also always be carrying a lot of danger. Superficially speaking, swatting a fly or two, what's the big deal? There's no need to make a fuss. However, the people who promote hygiene are all saying that eliminating flies is to promote public hygiene. It seems to be for everyone's sake. In fact, flies that do not recognize people may even like to get close to you. Then, eliminating flies can also be said to be for ourselves.</p>
<p>For example, there is also the transmission of tuberculosis. Now everyone understands that the most common way to get sick is by inhaling tuberculosis bacteria contained in dust. Originally, the tuberculosis bacteria in the dust were mostly caused by the sputum of tuberculosis patients being spat on the ground, drying up, and mixing into the dust, which then flew up. Then, the sputum of tuberculosis patients spitting on the ground is the main cause of tuberculosis transmission. You need to know that dust has no eyes, and it drifts with the wind, and it does not know your nostrils, your mouth, and the ventilating holes, and the breathing doors. It always flows arbitrarily. Therefore, if we are alive and constantly breathing, we are everywhere carrying three parts of danger. Then, when you want to persuade people not to spit on the ground, it is said that it is for the sake of the public's public health. In fact, we have two nostrils and one mouth, and when we do not stop breathing, are we not all getting his benefits and his protection? Speaking of which, it is still for ourselves.</p>
<p>Judging from the simple examples given above, no matter what treatment, what time, and what situation, if you do not pay attention to hygiene, in the end, others will indeed suffer from your harm. In turn, you are still harming yourself.</p>
<h3>General Assembly Declaration</h3>
<p>The survival competition of nations has now become the most urgent era. There are six elements of this competition:</p>
<p>㊀ Physical strength,</p>
<p>㊁ Intelligence,</p>
<p>㊂ Courage,</p>
<p>㊃ Agility,</p>
<p>㊄ Endurance,</p>
<p>㊅ Unity,</p>
<p>Although these six elements include both physical and mental aspects, a sound spirit resides in a sound body. Without strength, there is no sound spirit. Therefore, the fundamental element of national rejuvenation is still to seek physical health, and to make the body healthy, the most basic thing is to earnestly promote hygiene!</p>
<p>In the past, the reason why our Chinese nation failed time and again on the competitive stage and was in an oppressed position by imperialism was because our bodies were not strong, our knowledge was not sufficient, we lacked courage, we had no will to improve, we could not endure, and we could not unite. Therefore, we could only be slaughtered and insulted!</p>
<p>Now, if we are awakened, we should actively build up the cause of hygiene and move out hygiene knowledge so that all the people have a strong body, a sound spirit, a firm will, and the perseverance of endurance and unity. In this way, not only can we make the enemy slightly restrain their ambitions, but also we can obtain a solid guarantee for the future of national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>This city is holding a hygiene campaign, and this is the sixteenth session. It is difficult to accurately estimate the effectiveness of the hygiene campaigns held in the past. However, we do not take into account temporary successes or failures, but only hope to promote and carry forward the above-mentioned meaning and spirit!</p>

<h3>Wu Tiecheng Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yu Hongjun and others welcome him warmly with a special ferry across the Huangpu River. The Municipal Government also sent a large team of honor guards to pay their respects. He issued a written statement outlining his policy for governing Guangdong.</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, has been in Guangdong for nearly three months since he left his position as Mayor of this city in April to develop new projects. This time, he came to Shanghai to attend the tenth anniversary of the Municipal Government and to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Lushan. He arrived in Shanghai on the President McKinley of the Dollar Steamship Company at 11:00 yesterday morning, accompanied by Zhang Yuanruo, Director of the Design Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Government, Li Dachao, Chief of the Fourth Section, Huang Zuyao, Secretary, and attendants. All parties in this city welcomed him with a special ferry across the Huangpu River, which was extremely warm. The Municipal Government also sent honor guards to line up at the Great Eastern Wharf to pay their respects. Wu issued a written statement outlining his policy for governing Guangdong in detail. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel</p>
<p>The welcoming personnel boarded the specially prepared Municipal Ferry No. 5 at the Customs Wharf at 9:30 and sailed to the President McKinley to welcome him. They included Acting Mayor of this city, Yu Hongjun and his wife, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Bureau, Cai Jingjun, Director of the Police Bureau, Li Tingan, Director of the Health Bureau, Wen Huayin, Commander of the Security Corps, as well as senior officials such as Guo Le, Geng Jiaji, Tang Shixuan, Huang Shaoer, Section Chiefs of the Municipal Government, Ms. Ma Fengqi, wife of Chairman Wu, Jie Zixiang, disciple, Wang Zhinan, Secretary of the Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Wu Kaixian, Tong Xingbai, Jiang Huaishu, members of the Municipal Party Committee, Zhou Jue, Director of the former Diplomatic Office in Shanghai, representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Wang Xiaolai and Lu Bohong, Yang Dezhao, Li Xiangen, and friends from all walks of life, and reporters from various newspapers, totaling about 200 people.</p>
<p>Arrival Situation</p>
<p>The President McKinley was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 9:30, but was delayed until around 10:00 before entering the port. At 11:00, it docked at buoys No. 12 and No. 13 on the Yangshupu River. Wu immediately changed to the Municipal Ferry to greet and shake hands with the welcomers, looking very energetic. At this time, the full military band of the Municipal Police Bureau also played music on the ferry to welcome him.</p>
<p>Issuing a Statement</p>
<p>Wu met with reporters from various newspapers on the ship and issued a written statement as follows: I, Tiecheng, left Shanghai for Guangdong nearly three months ago. This time, I am going to Nanjing to report on my duties and will pass through Shanghai to attend the tenth anniversary celebration of the Shanghai Municipal Government and to treat my dental disease. I am deeply grateful to my friends for welcoming me upon my arrival. Since Guangdong Province was unified last year, the political and social situation has been improving day by day. Recently, the currency system has been reformed, and the ratio between Guangdong currency and national currency has been determined. Not only has the economic market become increasingly stable, but also the unification of finance and currency has increased the connection between Guangdong Province and the entire nation. Today's Guangdong, whether politically or economically, has laid a solid foundation. This is of great benefit to national construction and national rejuvenation. I, Tiecheng, am particularly pleased to have witnessed these two major achievements on my return to Guangdong.</p>
<p>Policy for Governing Guangdong</p>
<p>Regarding the policy for governing Guangdong, I, Tiecheng, made a declaration at the beginning of my term, which is divided into four major guidelines: ㊀ Political construction, ㊁ Economic construction, ㊂ Cultural construction, ㊃ Rural construction. Among the four, rural construction is the most central. Rural construction is not only an important plan for Guangdong to solve the food problem, but also the basic work for national construction from the perspective of the entire country. From a political point of view, such as organizing Baojia, handling autonomy, training young men, and national defense construction, from an economic point of view, such as alleviating the suffering of the people and cultivating the foundation of industry, from a cultural point of view, such as eliminating illiteracy and improving the level of knowledge and skills of the general people, all of these should start from rural areas, so as not to become empty talk and be of no practical benefit. Especially from the perspective of the province's position, all political, economic, cultural, and educational plans and facilities should take this as the basis. People of insight in the country have long advocated and spared no effort in the rural construction movement. However, Guangdong Province intends to concentrate the manpower and material resources of the entire provincial government to carry out comprehensive planning and seek thorough construction. At present, most of the specific implementation plans have been drafted, and the construction funds have also been raised. Before leaving Guangdong, I, Tiecheng, also summoned the directors of each department and the heads of each competent authority to discuss the specific methods of mobilizing to go to the countryside. The methods for the use, organization, and training of rural service personnel have also been drafted. In the near future, the rural construction of Guangdong Province can be moved from planning research to implementation and mobilization.</p>
<p>Opening Huangpu Port</p>
<p>Secondly, the opening of Huangpu Port has also moved from the planning stage to the implementation stage. Huangpu is the end point of the Yuehan Railway and a major port for importing and exporting goods from various provinces in the north and south. At present, the Huangpu branch line of the Yuehan Railway has been under construction for five months, and the roadbed has been completed in stages. It will be open to traffic in August or September. Other projects, such as harbor engineering, steel pile wharves, and transportation arteries, have also been contracted for and will be completed next year. The completion of this major southern port will not only greatly contribute to the economic development of Guangdong Province, but also play a powerful role in the development of the entire national economy. In addition, the development of Qiongyai, whether from a national defense or economic point of view, is important. The initial steps of its development are the construction of railways and wharves, and the development of the transportation network. It is hoped that those who are concerned about the development of South China and economic construction will actively invest and promote its success.</p>
<p>Provincial Industry</p>
<p>Furthermore, Guangdong's provincial industry has also laid a considerable foundation. For example, the provincial paper mill is currently the largest paper mill in China. Paper will be produced around February, using pine wood as raw material, with a daily output of about 50 tons. Guangdong Province is the birthplace of the revolution and should be a powerful link in the process of national construction in the future. Since the unification last year and the recent currency unification, the political economy has been very stable. From now on, we rely on concentrating talents, studying good plans, in order to promote the progress of the new government construction. I, Tiecheng, am serving my hometown, although I am determined to serve the country, my talent is limited. I hope that friends from all sides and sages from home and abroad will give more assistance, so that the construction of the new Guangdong can see results as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Inspecting the Police Force</p>
<p>Wu disembarked from the ship around 11:00 and took the municipal ferry across the river. He landed at the Dada Wharf in the South City at 11:30. The Municipal Government, because Wu came to attend the tenth anniversary celebration of the Municipal Government, specially sent a team of honor guards, security forces, and police to stand at the Dada Wharf in preparation for inspection. After Wu landed, he was accompanied by Acting Mayor Yu and Police Chief Cai Jingjun, Inspection Director Wang Dashui, and Deputy Commander of the Security Corps Wen Huayin to inspect. He then took a car directly back to his private residence on Haige Road.</p>
<p>Staying in Shanghai for a Week</p>
<p>Wu came here to participate in the tenth anniversary celebration of the Municipal Government and to treat his dental disease. He is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for about a week and will then go to Lushan to meet with President Chiang Kai-shek to report on provincial affairs. Acting Mayor Yu is scheduled to host a banquet for Wu tonight at 7:00 to welcome him and invite the directors of the various bureaus under the Municipal Government to accompany him.</p>

<h3>Ye Wenjin and Others Report: Suffering of Students Studying in Japan from Oppression</h3>
<p>Students in Tokyo are Unable to Focus on Studies, Will Petition the Central Government and Ambassador Xu</p>
<p>The Chinese Students' Associations, Provincial Fellow Associations, and other cultural organizations of Chinese students in various universities in Tokyo, considering that Chinese students in Japan are often arrested and oppressed by the Japanese authorities for no reason, causing anxiety and making it impossible to study, specially sent representative Ye Wenjin back to China to request relief from the central authorities and Ambassador Xu, so that more than 5,000 students studying in Japan can concentrate on their studies. Mr. Ye also held a press conference at the Guanshengyuan on Route de la Mission at 3:00 PM yesterday, inviting members of the press and cultural circles to report the details. Lu Yaowu and Yang Xianwu, responsible persons of the World Compilation Society who were recently expelled from Japan, also gave an on-the-spot report on the closure of the society. They will also pay a visit to Ambassador Xu to petition in the coming days. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Anxious Situation of Students Studying in Japan</p>
<p>Ye Wenjin reported on the uneasy situation of students studying in Tokyo, saying that Chinese students have a long history in Tokyo, but in recent years, there have been arbitrary arrests and expulsions. In the past six months alone, the Maodong News was shut down in February, and Zhang Jiandong and others were arrested and expelled. In the middle of the month, Wei Mengke and others from the Translation Society were arrested and expelled. Most recently, on June 12, eight people from the World Compilation Society were arrested and have also been expelled separately. In addition to those expelled in batches, there are still uncounted individuals who have been expelled and returned to China. Therefore, students in Tokyo have felt a great threat, and I was specially sent back to China to report the actual situation to compatriots in China and request relief. The closure and expulsion of a research academic organization shows the cultural oppression of students studying in Japan. The only purpose of students studying in Japan is to seek knowledge and research. The above-mentioned closed institutions are all purely academic research organizations with several years of history. The authorities suppressed them for no reason, making it difficult for students studying in Tokyo to satisfy their desire for knowledge. Japan also separates our Chinese students, calling students from the four northeastern provinces "Manchukuo" students and those from within the customs "Republic of China" students. Not only do they separate us in name, but also force the separation of our student associations in various universities. They strictly monitor our interactions and use various means to intimidate and coerce students from the Northeast, making them avoid approaching students from within the customs. They not only use various illegal means to spy on our friends' interactions, private letters, and group activities such as academic research, student associations, and fellow associations, but even privately open our letters, enter our private residences, and secretly flip through manuscripts and diaries. It is a pity that a country known for the rule of law should act so illegally towards students from neighboring countries. They privately use the Boxer Indemnity, hoping to create traitors. Students from the Northeast are often used as bait. They regard our patriotic students as "anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese" elements, often insult them privately, and once arrested, they are imprisoned and interrogated as a matter of course. As a result, they are expelled with the charges of "anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese" or even "communization."</p>
<p>The Recent Arrest of Eight People</p>
<p>Lu Yaowu and Yang Xianwu, who were expelled on June 37, then reported on the sudden closure of the World Compilation Society and the arrest and expulsion of colleagues. The World Compilation Society was established in Tokyo for almost two years. It usually studies knowledge from various countries, has pure thoughts, and its work is to compile and exchange knowledge, which is highly praised by general students. On June 12, it was suddenly searched by the Tokyo Police Department. As a result of the search, nothing was found. However, those in charge, myself (Lu Yaowu) and Yang Xianwu, Wang Kongzhao, Shi Baohu, Zhao Guibi, Yang Shike, Liu Qingzhen, Deng Keqiang, etc., were arrested separately and detained until the 28th of the same month, when they were expelled separately. The first batch was Yang Xianwu et al., the second batch was Wang Kongzhao et al., the third batch was myself et al., and the fourth batch was Zhao Guibi et al. When they were imprisoned, they were interrogated in secret rooms, and no charges have been disclosed so far. Therefore, this expulsion was a planned action by the authorities. However, we can only return in silence.</p>
<p>Petition Ambassador Xu for Relief</p>
<p>The returning representative Ye Wenjin et al., in order to maintain the safety of students studying in Japan and to focus on their studies, will petition the central authorities and Ambassador Xu Shiying in Japan in the coming days, requesting negotiation so that students studying in Japan should have considerable protection and freedom within the scope of the law, and demand the freedom to study, because writing and translating for students is their duty, and interference makes it impossible to progress. At the same time, they also demand that the Japanese side not arbitrarily arrest students for no reason, so that more than 5,000 students studying in Japan can be settled. In addition, students studying in Japan feel that students from within the customs are considered Chinese students, while those from the four northeastern provinces are considered "puppet Manchukuo" students, and there is no opportunity to talk and communicate. They feel extremely stimulated and painful in spirit. It is hoped that compatriots will pay close attention to these situations.</p>

<p>Citywide Celebration</p>
<p>All sectors of the city have erected various arches and flower gardens on the main thoroughfares of the city to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Municipal Government. There are more than 30 in the first district of South Shanghai, and more than 10 in Zhabei. Other places such as Pudong, Jiangwan, the city center, and Wusong also have exquisitely decorated arches. There are street-spanning electric lights and various colored torches on each electric pole and tree trunk on Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, and Heping Road in South Shanghai. The preparatory committee for the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Municipal Government in the northern district of the city held its fourth preparatory meeting yesterday, deciding that ㊀ the six colored lacquer arches donated by the association have been completed and the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company should be requested to connect the fire and light them on the evening of the 6th, ㊁ the celebration fireworks were originally scheduled to be set off on the 7th, 8th, and 9th, but are now changed to the 7th and 8th, because the 9th is the time donated by Xingzhuanglou to be set off every night from 9:00 PM in the square behind Baoshan Road Hongxing Road, ㊂ the donations received from all sectors and the expense accounts are entrusted to accountant Wang Haifan to review and announce. If there is any surplus, it will be donated to Sichuan Relief in full. In addition, in Xinhanzhen in Northwest Shanghai, Dong Pingxing, director of the Pusong Police Station, recently initiated and invited Shen Zongxin, representative of the local security group, Wang Tongde, representative of the Tenth District Party Department, etc., to convene a preparatory committee for the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Municipal Government. Dong Pingxing, Shen Zongxin, Wang Tongde, Cao Quan, etc. were elected as preparatory committee members, and it was decided to build three colored arches at the intersection of Bailinan Road and Pierce Road, the entrance of Luo Biegen Sa Zhen, and the west of the town, and to hold a lantern parade for three days from July 10 to 12. The town's lanterns have always been known for their exquisiteness, and there will definitely be strange lanterns displayed at that time, and the warm celebration is self-evident.</p>
<p>Exhibition Addresses</p>
<p>The various exhibitions participating in this event have entered a white-hot state of work yesterday, and the persons in charge of each association have been racking their brains to arrange the exhibitions to be as perfect as possible in order to achieve unexpected success. The exhibitions will be opened simultaneously at 10:00 AM on the opening day and closed simultaneously at 8:00 PM on the 18th. Visiting hours are from 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM daily. Each venue will sell tickets for 5 fen to limit the number of people. Jieyu Industry has an exhibition venue attached to the industrial exhibition. Because the venue is too small to accommodate a large number of visiting citizens, another 4 jiao per dollar will be charged. The Literature Association also finds that too many people visit on weekdays, so they can only take a quick look, and many people who study literature cannot stay at the meeting for a long time to examine it carefully, so it is specifically scheduled to increase the entrance fee to 3 jiao on Wednesdays in order to reduce the number of visitors, so that researchers can have enough time to browse. In order to facilitate the visit of citizens at that time, the addresses of each exhibition venue are listed separately as follows: ㊀ Air Defense Exhibition, around the reading platform hall on the west commander's platform of the City Sports Ground, ㊁ Industrial Exhibition, with a total of three displays: (A) Handicraft exhibition in the gymnasium, and the jade exhibition is also attached to it, (B) Mechanical industry exhibition in the new building next to the gymnasium, (C) Tea exhibition in the reed shed next to the swimming pool, ㊂ Industrial Safety Exhibition Hall, in Zhengzhong Primary School on Zhengzhong Road, ㊃ Municipal Exhibition Hall, in the library on Guofu Road, ㊄ Literature Exhibition Hall, in the museum on Fuwei Road, ㊅ Hygiene Exhibition Hall, in the Hygiene Experimental Institute on Wanyuan Road, other amusement locations, celebrations and Peking opera performances are performed on the public entertainment stage in front of the Municipal Government, and there are also star performances, sports, and fireworks, all of which are performed in the City Sports Ground.</p>

<h3>Fierce Competition Among Foreign Ships on the Xiamen-Philippines Route, Overseas Chinese Prefer to Travel on National Ships</h3>
<p>British Ships Cut Prices by 80%, But Overseas Chinese are Not Tempted, Haiheng's Voyage Successful</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xiamen-Philippines liner Haiheng had a collision with a boat in the Huangpu River during its first maiden voyage to Xiamen, drowning a boatman. Afterwards, the family of the deceased sued Chen Bingzhi, the chief mate of the Haiheng, in court, demanding that he be held responsible. Because Chen was serving on the ship and the ship did not go to Shanghai, the court sent a letter to Xiamen, summoning Chen to Shanghai to appear in court for questioning. Recently, Chief Mate Chen has returned to Shanghai from Xiamen, preparing to argue the case under maritime law to prove that the collision was not his responsibility. According to Chen, the patriotism of the overseas Chinese in Jianfei is a commendable fact. There are only 30,000 overseas Chinese traveling between Xiamen and Outer Luzon every year, but since the Haiheng started sailing, driven by patriotism, overseas Chinese, even those traveling between Xibo (Cebu) and Xiamen, are willing to give up foreign ships on the direct Xibo route and take the Haiheng to Manila before transferring to Xibo, not hesitating to spend more money and time to show their support for national ships. Therefore, the foreign merchants in the same shipping line admire this. This is one. He also said that the price competition of foreign ships cannot move the hearts of overseas Chinese. In the Xiamen-Philippines route, the British ship Anqing has always had a monopoly advantage and the most passengers. It has made huge profits for many years. Since the Haiheng started sailing, Anqing's business has plummeted. The Haiheng always has 360 to 370 passengers on each voyage, while the British ship only has 20 to 30 passengers each time, at most 50 to 60. As a result, the British merchants drastically reduced the price of tickets (third class between Xiamen and the Philippines) from 27 pesos (about 36 to 37 yuan) to 5 pesos. The Haiheng still sells for 27 pesos. The British ship cut prices by 80% in order to compete, but the overseas Chinese also agreed on a solution: those who take the national ship Haiheng to Xiamen will have their fares subsidized by the fishermen, not allowing them to take the cheap foreign ships. If they go from Xiamen to the Philippines, they will not be hired by employers unless they take the national ship. As a result, the price cuts of foreign ships have fundamentally failed, and the patriotism of overseas Chinese between Xiamen and the Philippines has been fully demonstrated. Now, the Haiheng on this route has a revenue of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per month from passenger business alone. The Feian, newly purchased from Wunei, still needs to be renovated and decorated, and after completion, it must first be dispatched to Qingdao route.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Exchange Brokers Association General Meeting</h3>
<p>Prohibition of Buying and Selling on Behalf of Small Companies</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yarn Exchange Brokers Association, following an order from the Social Affairs Bureau, has prohibited entrusted buying and selling on behalf of small companies. A general meeting of all members was convened yesterday at 2:00 PM in the conference room on the second floor of the Exchange. After a report by Vice President Cao Wenmei, it was resolved to comply and a circular was sent to all members for their information. All brokers were also asked to supervise and report on each other. After the meeting, a responsible person told reporters that this move by the government was to protect the business of colleagues and safeguard their position. Therefore, everyone was happy to comply. It is reported that these small companies are illegal organizations and should be banned. There are currently about one hundred of them.</p>
<h3>Mediation of Labor Dispute in Zhabei Silk Factories Yesterday</h3>
<p>Difficulties in Reaching Agreement Between the Parties; Suggestion to Negotiate Out of Court</p>
<p>After the workers of fourteen silk factories, including Fu Chang in Zhabei District, initiated a general strike to protest the factories' sudden implementation of a production quota system, party and government officials, together with the silk weaving unions of the six districts, went to earnestly persuade the workers to resume work over the past two days. However, the workers of each factory insisted on the cancellation of the production quota system and the implementation of eight demands before resuming work, so the labor dispute remains in a stalemate. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to prevent the labor dispute from expanding and to seek an early solution, convened both parties for mediation yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Representatives from the Silk Manufacturers Association, Shen Huachen and Zhang Peishen, representatives from the Six Districts Silk Reeling Union, Yuan Yunlong and Yang Gengti, representatives from the Four Districts Silk Reeling Union, Chen Xiupu and Yang Hongmei, and Wang Jiashu from the Municipal Party Headquarters were present. Director Wang Xianqing of the Mediation Office presided over the meeting. First, the chairman inquired about the details of the labor strike from the labor representatives and consulted the management on their response to the labor's demands. Subsequently, due to the difficulty in reaching an agreement, both parties were ordered to attempt to negotiate automatically and report the results for review within three days or to reconvene for mediation. The labor representatives were also responsible for persuading the workers to resume work first.</p>

<h3>British National Injured ZhaPu Soldiers On The Way To Moganshan</h3>
<p>The Soldiers Detained The British National But Later Released Him With Great Courtesy</p>
<p>Last Saturday, British nationals Adam and Hart, each with their families, traveled by car from Shanghai to Moganshan.

Their families were allowed to return to Shanghai in the original car. Adam then managed to report the matter by telephone to the British Consulate in Shanghai and the Asiatic Petroleum Company, as Adam was an employee of the company. The matter was later investigated by the manager of an insurance company, so the two men were released at 10:00 PM that night and arrived in Shanghai at noon on Sunday. According to the two men, they were treated with great courtesy while detained in Zhapu and were not guarded by armed soldiers.</p>

<h3>Fishing Boat Lost at Sea in Storm</h3>
<p>Three Killed</p>
<p>At 6:15 PM on the third day of this month, two Hongfeng fishing boats, No. 2 and No. 3 of the Hongfeng Company, were returning to Shanghai from fishing off Huanao Mountain. Both boats were diesel-powered. At midnight, they arrived at the sea north of Daji Mountain, when a sudden strong wind rose and huge waves surged, washing over the deck. The No. 2 boat was suddenly sunk to the bottom of the sea by the waves. All thirteen people on board fell into the sea.

<h3>Truth About the Murder of Zhao Jinshan, Stabbed Eighteen Times</h3>
<p>Claiming to Be a Gang Leader, Extorting Two Yuan; Fellow Gang Members Suspected Impersonation and Killed Him; The Murderer Zhang Quanfa and Others Have Also Been Arrested</p>
<p>At the entrance of No. 12, Lane 51, Xinzha Bridge Road, a man was suddenly assassinated and killed in the afternoon the day before yesterday. The Xinzha Police Station, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered Detective Ma Zhongrong to investigate. It was learned that the deceased was named Zhao Jinshan and had been stabbed eighteen times. In addition to sending the body to the coroner, the police arrested Zhang Quanfa and Zhang Xingsheng, both from Changshu, at 12:40 AM yesterday. At 9:30 AM, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang charged Zhang Quanfa with murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. As for Zhang Xingsheng, he requested detention for investigation. According to lawyer Wang, at 5:00 PM yesterday, Police Officer No. 558 of Lane 51, Xinzha Bridge Road, reported to Chinese Police Officer No. 2057 that a man had been stabbed to death at the entrance of No. 12 in the lane. The Chinese police officer reported to the police station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. It was found that the deceased, Zhao Jinsheng (also known as Zhao Xiaolong), from Jiangbei, was an unemployed gangster who specialized in extortion. Since the first year of the Republic, he had committed numerous crimes and had been arrested and imprisoned many times. Most recently, he was sentenced to fifty days of detention for a crime and was released on June 21. However, he did not repent and continued to make a living by extortion. At about 9:00 AM on the fourth day of this month, Zhao went to the Central Clock and Watch Shop at No. 56, Xinzha Bridge Road, to extort money, claiming that he was the leader of the gangsters in the area and extorting two yuan. The shop owner paid the money at that time. Not long after, another gangster, Shen A'san, also went to the shop to extort protection money. The shop owner told him that Zhao Jinshan, the leader of your gang, had already taken it. Upon hearing this, Shen, who considered himself the leader of the area, felt extremely humiliated that Zhao dared to overstep his authority. Therefore, he invited his gang members, Gao Linsheng and the defendant Zhang Quanfa, and others to hide sharp weapons and seek out Zhao to provoke him. When they arrived at the entrance of No. 12, Lane 51, they met Zhao. They stepped forward and stabbed him repeatedly. Zhao fell to the ground and died instantly. Shen and the others all fled. However, the defendant Zhang Quanfa suddenly felt disoriented after seeing Zhao's death and could not control himself. He wandered around aimlessly and invited his fellow villager Zhang Gusheng to accompany him. It was not until after 12:00 AM this morning that he was arrested by Chinese Detective Ma Zhongrong on North Xizang Road, and so on. Judge Huang Risheng verified the confession and briefly questioned Zhang and others, ordering them to be detained for another hearing on the 14th. Meanwhile, Zhang, a prosecutor from the Special Court Prosecutor's Office, was appointed to examine the body at the coroner's office. It was confirmed that the deceased, Zhao Jinshan, had been stabbed to death before his death. The body was handed over to his niece, Chen Zhao, who signed a guarantee to claim it.</p>

<p>A Robber Breaks In</p>
<p>At 2:50 PM yesterday, a young robber suddenly broke into Yifeng Cloth Shop at No. 21, Lane 212, Ningbo Road (opposite the Money Exchange Guild). The robber was wearing a blue long gown and carried a box gun. After entering the shop, he went straight to the counter, forbade the shop assistants from making noise, opened the drawer, and seized more than fifty yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Continuous Robbery</p>
<p>At that time, there was a customer chatting with a shop clerk in the reception room of the shop.

<p>Firing and Fleeing</p>
<p>After the robbery, the robber was about to flee out the door when the Chinese police officer summoned by the coachman stepped into the lane entrance in the north section. Seeing the situation, the robber became anxious and fired a shot at the police officer. The Chinese police officer quickly dodged, and fortunately was not hit. However, the robber took the opportunity to flee south, making it impossible to catch him. Not long after, a large number of detectives arrived from the Central Police Station, but the robber had already escaped. They inspected the shop and inquired about the robber's appearance in order to apprehend him.</p>

<p>Wang Xinggao, the murderer in the case of instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Second Special Court. Wang appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, which overturned the sentence and released him on bail. Because the Police Affairs Department refused to accept the decision, it appealed to the Supreme Court, which revoked the acquittal and sent the case back to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. Because Wang's whereabouts are unknown, the Third Branch of the High Court ordered Wang's guarantors, Huang Shijie and Jin Changqing, and others to appear in court for questioning. Because the guarantors also did not know Wang's whereabouts, they were ordered to pay the two thousand yuan security deposit to the court for review. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Daqi of the Third Branch of the High Court continued the hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court. Wang's guarantors, Jin Changqing and Huang Shijie, stated that they still did not know Wang's whereabouts and paid the cash security deposit as ordered. Judge Chen ordered them to pay directly to the accounting office of the court and ordered the guarantors to find and hand over Wang Xinggao to the court within one week. If they fail to do so, they will be dealt with accordingly. Wang Yisheng, the representative of Li Meidong, the owner of the Meidong Shop, who was detained as a guarantor, was ordered to be released in court and ordered to find and hand over Li Meidong to the court without delay. After the order was issued, the court adjourned. Zhang, a prosecutor from the Special Court Prosecutor's Office, was then appointed to examine the body at the coroner's office. It was confirmed that the deceased, Zhao Jinshan, had been stabbed to death before his death. The body was handed over to his niece, Chen Zhao, who signed a guarantee to claim it.</p>
<h3>Demanding Payment Was Falsely Accused Of Extortion</h3>
<p>Wang Shanhai's Ill Intentions; Hong Wanqing Ultimately Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>Hong Wanqing founded the Pacific Overshoe Factory several years ago. However, due to poor business, it soon went bankrupt. Wang Shanhai, who was a salesman for the Pacific Overshoe Factory, owed Hong more than three hundred yuan at the time. Recently, Hong worked as a salesman for the Baoxingsheng Overshoe Factory opened by Ge Baohua, but his income was limited and insufficient to cover his expenses. Therefore, he asked Wang Shanhai to pay the old debt. On the evening of the second day of this month, knowing that Wang was hosting guests at the Zhenmingyue Bookstore in Xifuzhi Lane, Guangxi Road, Hong went there. However, Wang was playing mahjong at the time, so he arranged to pay the money at the Leyuan Teahouse on Erma Road at 9:00 AM the next morning. When Hong Wanqing went there at the appointed time, Wang, harboring ill intentions, reported to the Old Zha Police Station in advance, accusing Hong of extortion. The police dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to wait at Leyuan. Seeing Hong receiving the money, they arrested him and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao’yi stood up and explained the case, stating that the case also involved private affairs between men and women, while the defendant denied extortion. Ge Fuhua, the owner of Baoxingsheng Overshoe Factory, testified everything. Judge Feng ruled in court that Hong Wanqing was declared not guilty.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Money Exchange Guild Holds Emergency Meeting Yesterday to Warn Against Accepting Fake Manchukuo Currency</h3>
<p>Will Hold Oath Ceremony Not to Accept Fake Manchukuo Currency; Hongkang and Other Three Money Shops Deny Being Involved in Sales</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Exchange Guild received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that according to a confidential order, a large number of fake banknotes from the Central Bank of Manchukuo had recently been transported to Shanghai by Yokohama Shokin Bank and the Taiwan-Korea-Shanghai Bank for distribution and exchange. The guild believed that three of the six money shops involved were members of the guild and should be thoroughly investigated and prohibited. It convened a temporary emergency executive meeting yesterday. The three member shops, Hongkang, Shunyu, and Liyuan, were shocked to see reports that they were involved in the sales and exchange, and jointly submitted a letter to the guild, stating that this was not true and requesting an investigation, and stating that if there was any evidence, they were willing to accept punishment and listen to the public judgment of the people. After investigation, it was confirmed that the report was not true. The guild was deeply concerned that some members, disregarding the national interest and seeking petty profits, might secretly engage in exchange, and issued a notice warning all members not to accept the banknotes, and it was heard that an oath ceremony not to accept fake Manchukuo currency would be held, and a written oath would be printed and sealed by each member and kept by the guild for compliance.</p>

<h3>Petition Representatives for Compensation for Wrongful Imprisonment Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association recently appointed three committee members, including Le Junwei, Zhang Juan Sheng, and Xu Zuoliang, as representatives to petition the Executive Yuan in Beijing to expedite the promulgation and implementation of regulations regarding compensation for wrongful imprisonment.

They will then present a detailed report of the proceedings at a future association meeting, where each representative will be present.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Notice to All Industries: Strictly Enforce Measures Against Non-Membership</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to all trade associations, stating: "Regarding the proposal by the Old Timber Trade Association, discussed at the 8th Members' Congress of the Chamber on June 19 of this year, to strictly enforce the measures against non-membership in trade associations formulated by the Ministry of Civil Training of the Central Party Headquarters. The justification stated that trade associations are collectives of businesses in the same industry, and thus, businesses are essential components of the association. In modern commerce, progress requires collective effort; internal organization must be sound, and external progress is difficult without long-term planning. Therefore, anyone with a basic understanding of these principles should join and support the association to achieve unity and mutual assistance. However, there are corrupt elements who are ignorant of these principles and disregard the overall situation, either taking a wait-and-see attitude, standing idly by, or reluctantly joining but failing to pay dues. They are unaware that membership dues are stipulated in the association's constitution, and economic resources are the lifeblood of any endeavor. It is difficult for even the most skilled housewife to cook without rice. Therefore, if businesses that do not join trade associations or join but fail to pay dues according to the rules are not sanctioned, the existing trade associations will inevitably fail to sustain themselves, and it will be impossible to stimulate public interest and ensure that the public has sound organizations.</p>
<p>Currently, it is reported that the Ministry of Civil Training of the Central Party Headquarters has formulated measures to sanction non-membership in trade associations, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. However, the enforcement procedures stipulated in these measures require each trade association to petition the Chamber of Commerce, which then forwards the request to the local administrative authorities. The Chamber of Commerce remains the central hub. Therefore, it is essential for the Congress to resolutely and promptly implement these measures when petitioned in the future and request the administrative authorities to strictly enforce them to achieve a deterrent effect and reverse the wait-and-see attitude. We respectfully await your decision." This was resolved by the Congress and referred to the Executive Committee for handling. At the 12th Executive Committee meeting on the 3rd of this month, the matter was raised for discussion, and it was resolved to notify all trade associations and inform all members. We hereby record and notify you. Please investigate and inform all members as required.</p>

<h3>National Physicians Prepare Pulse Study Association</h3>
<p>Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners rely on pulse diagnosis as the standard for treating illnesses, exploring pathologies, and determining symptoms. Therefore, ancient physicians were known for their expertise in pulse diagnosis, and there was a saying that the pulse does not deceive. However, since the Tang and Song dynasties, relying solely on the radial artery in the hand to infer the condition of the internal organs, without examining the pulses throughout the body, is contrary to modern anatomical theories. Therefore, national physician Yao Xinyuan advocated restoring Zhang Zhongjing's three-part pulse method from the Han Dynasty, comparing and diagnosing the cun kou (radial artery), ren ying (carotid artery), and fu yang (dorsalis pedis artery). He lectured in Shanghai, Suzhou, and other places and published a book called "Pulse Study Restoration." The medical community across the country has enthusiastically supported this, and the Central National Medicine Institute and the Ministry of Health have commended it, marking a new record in the history of traditional Chinese medicine. As a result, individuals enthusiastic about improving medicine are preparing to establish the Chinese Pulse Study Association. According to Zhang Ziying, the head of the preparatory committee, membership applications have been enthusiastic, reaching over 300 people. A founding meeting will be convened soon, and members in Pinghu and other places are also initiating the preparation of branch organizations. Those who aspire to improve pulse studies and wish to study medicine in depth can send a letter to Zhang Ziying's medical office at Fudeli, west end of Mahou Road, Edward Road, to request the constitution.</p>

<h3>The Retort of the Monk Driven Out by the Incense Keeper</h3>
<p>— Zhen Shilin</p>
<p>When the incense keeper has lived in the temple for a long time, he will inevitably covet the temple's property. Thus, the guest becomes the master, and the incense keeper drives out the monk.</p>
<p>This situation is very similar to the concessions in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The so-called concessions originally referred to areas designated in treaty ports for foreign businesses to lease land for commerce. Merchants from the lessee countries could lease land and build houses within the boundaries. Although the affairs within the boundaries could be managed by agencies established by each country, the most important thing that could not be ignored was that the local sovereignty still belonged to China.</p>
<p>However, what is the actual situation of the Shanghai concessions? What kind of treatment do Chinese people receive in the concessions? "Great power is lost, and we are at the mercy of others." This has been a long-standing problem for decades, and now it has become increasingly severe. The concessions have become their colonies! Taking the screening of films and dramas as an example, works approved by the Central Film Censorship Board cannot be freely screened in the concessions, but they pretend to be deaf and blind when facing films that insult China. This kind of overstepping and unfair actions, reaching their peak recently, have awakened the self-awareness of the Chinese nation. Therefore, the cultural community has launched a movement to revoke the censorship rights of films and dramas in the concessions. Sixteen organizations have joined, and five preparatory committee members have been elected, with the founding meeting scheduled for the 11th.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the monk's preparation to retaliate after being driven out by the incense keeper, after deep pain and suffering. Saying "beginning" obviously does not mean the "ultimate" goal; but although it is not the ultimate goal, the responsibility for this retaliation is extremely important. If the retaliation is weak, it will not only discourage and affect the subsequent fighting power, but also, if the first shot fails, the incense keeper will know the monk's weakness and will oppress even more severely. At that time, I am afraid that the monks will not only be in a terrible mess.</p>
<p>The most unfortunate thing is that some of us are now monks who have been driven out of the temple gate, but some are still unaware, thinking that being driven out is natural. Therefore, I think the preliminary work is to awaken everyone and unanimously join the "retaliation" group. Revoking the censorship rights of films in the concessions is not only a matter for a few people, but even more not only a matter for the cultural community. Every resident of the concessions needs to stand up and participate in the effort. Only by concentrating the power of the majority is there real power.</p>
<p>What we want to tell the incense keeper and ourselves is that this retaliation is not based on a "anti-foreign" mentality. This is only to reclaim our sovereignty that has been lost for many years. This kind of sovereignty is necessary to reclaim after anyone loses it.</p>
<p>The difficulty of the work is undoubted, and the increased oppression is also expected. We must unite and cultivate a strong sense of self-confidence. We firmly believe that "justice" and "light" do not insist on separating from us. If we pursue them with great determination.</p>
<p>I would like to contribute this short essay to the "Shanghai Cultural Community's Movement to Revoke the Film and Drama Censorship Rights in the Concessions," and sincerely wish the meeting success and the full support of the 3 million citizens of Shanghai!</p>

<h3>The Old Hunter</h3>
<p>— Rui Yao</p>
<p>Recently, I received a letter from home, which ended with this paragraph: "Uncle Fuxiang was shot and killed last month. It is said that he was a victim of banditry because he was passing information. But whether he did such a thing, no one is very clear. However, seeing the difficult life he has led in recent years, people have indeed changed a lot compared to before! ..."</p>
<p>Since I have had any memories, this old man has long been a famous hunter in our small town. Although he also had a so-called "home," the only things there were a dilapidated house inherited from his ancestors, a wife he had finally managed to marry at the age of thirty with his own efforts, and a few hunting dogs used as tools for making a living. There was nothing else worth recording. In his mind, there were no extravagant hopes, no long-term plans; no dreams, and no thoughts of gratitude or grudges. But he also had his own beliefs and his own code of conduct: he was superstitious about work, believing that diligence and hard work are a person's duty. Therefore, despite the hardship of his life, he was like a heavily loaded old ferry, without groaning, without lamenting, silently shouldering the heavy burden of life, and passing the dull days one by one.</p>
<p>No matter what day it was, as soon as the east turned white, he would prepare some dry food, gather his old hunting companions, carry nets, and take dogs, and walk together into the vast mountains and forests. It was not until the sun had set, or even the clear moon hung high in the blue sky, that he would stagger back, carrying all over his body the fatigue. No matter how much he had hunted, the prices of all kinds of wild game were fixed, and they were always a little cheaper than others. Therefore, whenever the setting sun slanted over the distant peaks, many customers would be waiting at his home. As soon as he returned home, the game would be bought up. If the hunt was particularly good that day, he would leave a fox, a wild boar, or a wild rabbit for himself to enjoy. He would instruct his wife to slaughter it, and he would take the gourd that had been passed down from who knows how many years ago, and drag his tired eyes to Huangzhen, more than five li away, to buy wine. By the time the wine was bought back, the dishes his wife was cooking would be almost ready. At this time, he would also invite his hunting companions from neighboring villages, as well as two or three old men of similar age from his own village, to his home to drink together. As soon as people sat down at the table, the conversation would start up. They talked about hunting, about the harvest, about the distant stories that had faded in everyone's memory, ... talking like this, they would always talk until after midnight before parting ways. If you were to ask whether he ever felt happy in all those days he lived, then an evening spent like that would be the happiest, most enjoyable evening for him.</p>
<p>He had no children or grandchildren of his own, but he loved children very much. When a child came to his house, he would treat them like his own, using his withered hands to touch their heads and cheeks kindly. Sometimes he would even take out some wild game to give to the child, and tell them stories or strange sights he had seen and heard in the mountains and forests. At that time, in my childish heart, I was very envious of his leisurely life, and I always hoped that I would grow up quickly so that I could go with him to the desolate mountains and deep valleys to live. In fact, how could it only be children who had such thoughts? The farmers in our town, who would not often say with an admiring tone: "Uncle Fuxiang is really lucky, he doesn't have to worry about natural disasters, he doesn't have to worry about grain prices, if he has no money in his pocket, he can go to the mountains to get it, if there is no rice in his pot, he can go to the mountains to get it, really..."</p>
<p>The year before last, when I was in Beiping, a friend came from my hometown and talked about Uncle Fuxiang's recent situation, sighing sadly, "Now the place is poor, and everyone is struggling to find a way to get two meals of white rice a day. Where do they have the spare money to eat wild game! The life he leads is really not as good as it used to be! ..." At the time, I just felt that everyone's life was difficult, and that some more weight of life had only been added to his hunched back. This, for an old man accustomed to carrying heavy burdens, might not be considered such a big hardship. Who would have thought that only a little more than a year later, he would have such an ending!</p>
<h3>Reader's Voice: The Cry of Small Merchants</h3>
<p>— A Citizen of Zhabei</p>
<p>The difficulties of small smoke and grocery shop merchants cannot be truly understood unless one has personally experienced them. They buy goods in bulk for a fixed price and sell them off in small quantities, a level of trouble and triviality that is unmatched by any other endeavor. Yet, the fruits of their hard work are diminished because, in addition to the tobacco and alcohol tax, salt tax, and property tax, there are also local gangsters who demand festival dues every year during the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and at the end of the year. In autumn, there are miscellaneous taxes, and those who are slightly unscrupulous or greedy even borrow money at ordinary times, with all sorts of unspeakable pretexts, which must be satisfied. Otherwise, you will suffer overt or covert losses, and it will even be difficult to continue operating, etc. They barely manage to cover expenses, let alone enjoy comfortable food and clothing, dancing halls, theaters, or grand hotels!</p>
<p>Mr. Reporter, you are able to advocate for the people. Now, I am reporting to you the oppression and suffering that I have indirectly experienced and may directly experience in the future, which can also represent the cries of many small merchants in Shanghai. I dare to ask that you publish it, hoping that the authorities can understand the suffering of small merchants, sympathize with them, and grant them leniency! The matter is as follows:</p>
<p>A vermicelli shop in Zhabei's ☓ Road, owned by ☓, has been operating a Beijing goods store in Zhabei for decades. He has always been cautious and especially attentive to national taxes. Last year, due to the poor business of his grocery store on ☓ Road, he changed his strategy and took over a vermicelli shop on the current ☓ Road. It has been a year now. Cigarettes are one of the goods he sells as a side business, and sales are actually small. However, when he moved from ☓ Road last year, he still had some cigars (which were determined to be unlicensed, and the company has now closed down). He has not sold them yet because ☓ Road is a slum with no cigar smokers, so he put them in the cupboard. After a year, he almost forgot about them. If the shop owner had known that these cigars were prohibited from being sold, he would have secretly hidden them at the time.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, several people suddenly arrived with the police and went straight into the shop, with a tense atmosphere as if they were capturing a major criminal or facing a formidable enemy. They claimed to be inspecting counterfeit cigarettes. The shop owner, a very honest old man, naturally allowed them to search as they pleased. However, the result was that they did not find any counterfeit cigarettes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the inspectors found the cigars that the shop owner or employees had long forgotten in an old cupboard.</p>
<p>As a result, the old shop owner was taken to the police substation, then to the Zhabei Inspection Sub-Bureau, being tossed around and tired for a whole day. No matter how you explained it, they initially said that a bail of thirty yuan was required. Later, because the shop owner could not produce that much money, it was reduced to ten yuan, and he was given something like a receipt.</p>
<p>The receipt was the evidence for the shop owner to be interrogated again at the General Inspection Bureau. What it said was truly insulting!</p>
<p>It said, "☓☓☓ et al. seized ☓☓☓ selling unlicensed cigars privately on ☓ Road..."! Doesn't the word "seized" already treat the shop owner as a seller of smuggled goods? Has he not already become a criminal? In fact, the shop owner said that last year, these cigars were clearly sold to him by street vendors. They even sent a cigarette tray to be placed on the counter for advertising, clearly allowing them to be sold publicly. If these cigars were to be prohibited, why were they not prohibited at the time? Why prohibit them now? The cigars were manufactured by a cigarette company. Why don't the inspectors prohibit the cigarette company and instead prohibit the seller? If the cigarette company has already closed down, then the inspection bureau should announce to all shops that the sale of this type of cigarette is prohibited. Why use such a swift and unexpected method and then give people the infamous name of "seized"?</p>
<p>Yes, this action, on the part of the inspection bureau, is in accordance with regulations, and it is a public matter handled officially. However, they do not know that most small merchants are ignorant of current affairs and therefore do not know what is going on, causing them to suffer great injustice! If the General Inspection Bureau interrogates him and orders him to pay a fine of several tens of yuan because the shop owner has no money, wouldn't that kill him?</p>
<p>At the same time, the small merchants in the Zhabei area who have suffered the same pain from inspection are not limited to one. Among them, there are certainly those who knowingly violate the law and deserve to be punished, but there must also be more than one who has suffered injustice like the one mentioned above. They cannot speak, and there is nowhere to speak. The writer loves the government and has deep feelings for his fellow merchants, so he has hastily presented this hidden situation here. I hope that the authorities, after receiving this hidden situation, will consider the hardship of small merchants, show them compassion, improve matters of this kind, and relieve the people's plight!</p>
