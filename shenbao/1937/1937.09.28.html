<h3>敵各路進犯均未得逞永安橋我軍繼續挺進</h3>
<p>康家弄沈家宅均被我軍控制　寶山路八字橋我軍奮勇退敵　羅店西北昨激戰終日</p>
<p>本報今晨二時接得昨日各路戰况如下、㊀羅店方面、敵軍由長橋至曹王廟以北之綫、自昨晨拂曉起、全綫向我陣地攻擊、陸空兩軍同時出動、其步兵均配備輕重武器、由坦克車前導、在大砲飛機立體式之轟炸下、向我正面陣地進撲、我前綫守軍、沉着應戰、毫不退讓、我砲兵陣地、亦以重砲密集轟擊、阻其前進、最前綫展開極猛烈之爭奪戰、浴血衝鋒、不下十餘次、激戰終日、雙方損傷、均極慘重、至午夜、猶在惡戰中、㊁劉行方面、我軍收復永安橋後、乘勝向楊行之綫繼續挺進、敵軍亦由楊行·新鎮·分途飛調援軍、增厚兵力、負嵎頑抗、至昨晚十時許、仍在永安橋以東約一公里地帶劇戰、我軍因戰勝之威、士氣大為振奮、敵軍畏縮不前、陣地漸趨動搖、我方極佔優勢、㊂閘北至江灣之綫、自昨日傍晚起、敵分三路進犯、一由翔殷路、以持志大學為目的、一由江灣路、以八字橋西至方家木橋為目的、一由商務印書館東面、以寶山路為目的、每路均以戰車數輛掩護前進、我軍分途迎頭痛擊、至今農零時、寶山路及八字橋方面之敵、已被我擊退、惟江灣路方面、仍在持志大學附近激戰中、</p>
<h3>由永安橋繼續挺進我軍進抵沈家宅</h3>
<p>乘敵喘息未定神速挺進　敵軍死傷遍地不支後退</p>
<p>劉行方面、金家灣一役、我軍將敵軍擊潰後、我軍乘勝沿公路挺進、敵潰不成軍、紛向楊行退却、我軍遂將永安橋收復、同時仍節節進展、追綜敵軍前進、前晚已進抵永安橋東北之康家弄與西沈家宅、在該處與敵軍發生激烈戰鬥後潰之敵、前晚向我軍反攻殊烈、坦克車數輛、一再掩護其步隊衝來、俱被我軍砲火擊退、敵機在空中、亦大為活動、紛向我軍陣地投彈、寶山江中敵艦、亦發重砲助戰、海陸空同時發動、來勢雖猛、但我軍英勇將士、奮起迎戰、雖在敵軍砲彈之下、衝鋒前進、與敵軍作最劇烈之肉搏戰、通宵血戰、至昨晨拂曉、敵軍死傷遍地、不支後退、激戰稍息移時、敵軍以援軍補充、又向前犯、我軍再接再厲、子以痛擊、</p>
<p>中央社云、我軍於廿六日收復永安橋重要地點後、乘勝追擊、緊隨敵後、不予以喘息之機會、我軍進展神速、敵以後退不及、致短兵相接、展開激烈之肉搏戰、敵且戰且退、至晚我向東北推展約一公里、進據康家弄沈家宅兩村、當布置警戒綫敵亦以坦克車為臨時防禦物、掩護頑守、至昨晨（廿七日）激戰未已、敵艦頻以大砲轟擊、敵機亦低飛以機槍掃射助戰、我軍在敵海陸空之夾擊中、沉着應付、使敵不敢輕犯、</p>
<h3>水電路我包抄敵軍</h3>
<p>昨晨四時、在晨光曦微中、愛國女學之敵、以坦克車三輛、掩護步兵二中隊、向我水電路持志大學方面陣地進犯、我守軍見敵來勢猛烈、卽避開正面、分向左右兩方包抄、用密集火力、以毀滅敵軍為目的、同時我砲隊亦向愛國女學敵軍陣地轟擊、敵之前哨與後隨步隊、失却聯絡、我軍奮勇出擊、擊斃敵兵二十餘人、至七時左右敵勢不支、紛向愛國女校方面潰退、</p>
<h3>敵艇窺探浦東口岸</h3>
<p>昨晨二時起、敵方汽艇取遊擊戰略、在浦江中心往返、向浦東各口岸窺探、不時用機檐射擊、一經我軍還槍、敵兵畏死、卽逃之夭夭、昨晨拂曉、我敵雙方再度以重砲交戰、時稀時密、至上午八時、敵機三架、飛向浦東上空助戰、擲下炸彈、但以漫無標的、絕無效果、昨今日午前、敵艦惟隔數十分鐘發一砲彈觀其連日懦弱之行動、攻佔浦東之幻夢、早已消滅、</p>
<h3>敵分三路進?江灣閘北昨夜激戰</h3>
<p>企圖破我陣綫發生空前激戰　我軍奮勇抵抗敵軍一籌莫展</p>
<p>昨日午後敵機在閘北一帶投彈時、江灣市中心區方面敵軍、調動頗為忙碌、我軍據探報知、敵又將進犯、卽令全綫嚴密戒備、至晚七時、敵果以一聯隊以上之兵力、藉坦克車十餘輛之掩護沿翔殷路向我體育會路陣地進撲、我軍奮勇抵抗、卽發生空前激戰、約半時後、又有敵一中隊向我北站方面進襲、經我軍以機關搶掃射、斃敵多人、相持僅一刻鐘、敵卽知難而退、至八時左右、持志大學粵東中學及八字橋兩處、亦發現大量敵軍、興翔殷路一部敵軍、向我夾攻、一時砲聲隆隆、雜以步槍機關槍及手溜彈之聲、夜深人靜後、全市尤淸晰可辩、此次敵以一聯隊以上之兵力、分數路進攻、似有欲一鼓而突破我該處陣綫之野心、惟我軍準備充分、士氣旺盛、迄深夜敵未有進展、</p>
<h3>我砲轟敵軍陣地</h3>
<p>雙方砲火激烈前所未有　敵機轟炸閘北僅燬民房　敵小部隊騷擾被我痛擊</p>
<p>昨日起、敵軍因共新增援軍開到接防、乃又復蠢然思動、向我全綫來犯、同時於昨晨五時起、利用其市中心區方面之敵軍砲兵陣地、以重砲向我江灣閘北一帶、作漫無標的之轟射、當時我浦東及□□方面之砲隊、亦立卽起而還擊、向敵之根據地虹口一帶、頻施砲轟、因我砲手測標正確、故</p>
<p>敵方受損奇重</p>
<p>而雙方砲聲之密、實足驚人、結果我方除民房稍遭損害外、其他絕無影響、敵軍乃遺其飛機六架、分隊至閘北一帶偵察、希冀窺探我方陣地、並於八時三十分許、在閘北區內、連續投下重量炸彈十餘枚、其猛烈爆炸之聲、震撼全市、寶山路方面一部房屋、卽起火焚燒、黑煙直衝雲霄、斯時北四川路方面之敵軍小部隊、卽乘隙向東新民路·虬江路‧寶山路等處來犯、我軍窺其將近、卽以機關槍自動步槍掃射、敵見我方有備、立卽遁去、但其偵察及轟炸飛機、仍盤旋未去、直至上午十一時、始悄然離境、未幾又來、連在北四川路廣東街附近、投彈六枚、其小部隊又乘機來攻、結果</p>
<p>仍被我軍擊退</p>
<p>於是敵軍砲兵復起轟射、惟敵軍砲手技術、過分幼稚、致一彈落於西蘇州路宜昌路附近申新第九紗廠堆棧屋上、尾頂被毁、幸未傷人、至下午一時許、敵又以一小部隊向嶺南路粤秀路以東半英里地方、向我陣地襲擊、當時我軍立起抗戰、激戰約半小時、敵終不支潰退、敵軍乃重復轉向北站附近及寶山路附近、前來挑釁、同時其砲兵陣地、亦轉向該處一帶亂射、雖有數彈墮落田野間、但我軍鎮靜異常、集中機關槍火力、密向敵陣掃射、予敵重創至下午二時左右、敵不支潰退、但其砲轟仍亂發不已、而我砲兵、亦以</p>
<p>重砲密切還擊</p>
<p>敵軍無隙可乘、乃又潰其飛機續在閘北一帶偵察、並亂擲重量之炸彈、但我方陣地、絕對未被所算、且被我以高射砲高射機關槍轟擊、予敵機以莫大威脅、而倉皇遁去、同時我方砲兵、更以密集之火力、向敵陣矗射、彈多中的、故敵軍捐失頗重、雙方砲擊、直至下午四時後始漸疏落、至於浦東方面、於昨晨九時許、亦有敵機三架、飛至浦東天空盤旋窺察、約一刻餘鐘、斯時所有停泊楊樹浦方面之敵艦、卽</p>
<p>向我浦東發砲</p>
<p>砲聲甚密、我該處駐軍、除密切還擊外、更以高射機關槍向空射擊、敵機倉皇遁去、敵砲亦卽中止、共後敵機又數度飛往浦東窺察、但敵艦未機續發砲、我浦東方面之砲兵陣地、昨日以重砲斷續向楊樹浦方面敵軍陣地轟擊、敵方受損頗鉅、</p>
<h3>我構火網斃敵兩百</h3>
<p>羅店方面、日前我軍攻克之某交通要口、預料敵於旦夕間、必須傾力來犯、乃積極構築防禦工事、並於兩側隱蔽物處、架設機槍、對準路口、構成“火網”形勢、詎至前日薄暮、敵果傾力來犯、先用飛機大砲掩護繼有敵兵約三百人、猛力衝至、我軍迨彼衝入火網、乃密集射擊、敵軍當有二百餘人、中彈紛紛倒斃、餘卽狼狽潰退、當搜檢遺屍、得聯隊中小隊敵旗多面、係敵十一師團佐藤部、內有一隊長日記簿上、記有華軍作戰神勇、日方前途暗淡等語、</p>
<p>羅店方面、我軍收復金家宅後、憑敵軍防禦工事堅守、全綫未有變化、</p>
<h3>敵機昨日又出投彈</h3>
<p>昨日上午七時起至十一時、又有敵機九架、分三架一隊、在市區各地偵察、並在南市大南門附近投下三彈、</p>
<p>昨日天方拂曉、敵機三架、在楊樹浦方面起飛、旋於六時許侵人我閘北天空、向該處我陣地窺察投彈、我駐軍以高射砲及高射機關槍向敵機射擊、敵機仍盤旋不去、但不敢低飛、所投炸彈、亦不中的、僅有若干處毁去民房數間、別無損失、十一時左右、敵機二度飛閘北天空、亦經我軍以密集火力向空射擊、敵機倉皇遁去、</p>
<p>昨午二時許、敵機又至閘北我陣地上空盤旋、時來時去、肆意投彈、至榜晚始飛去、我軍當以高射機關槍射擊、敵機不敢低飛、所投炸彈、漫無標的、我陣地損失極微、</p>
<h3>敵方空軍大量增加</h3>
<p>中央社云、頃據來自楊樹浦之某西人談、敵在楊樹浦路底公大紗廠東高爾夫球塲、改築之臨時飛機塲、規模甚鉅、渠並目覩該機塲內停有敵機二百餘架、觀此、可知敵連日來除於軍隊軍火二方面積極增補外、同時對空軍亦已大量增加云、</p>
<p>中央社南京廿七日電、軍息連日敵機炸我京滬沿綫、係由海軍航空第三第四兩中隊担任、指揮官為和田、其率領者為高橋白相、山下太尉、（編者按山下已在太倉被俘）</p>
<h3>增援敵軍又到五千</h3>
<p>敵混合編成之第四次增援軍一師團及一旅團合約四萬人、連日來已有二萬人左右、業已在滬東區各碼頭續登陸、昨日下午一時起、又有敵商輸改建之第三三四號運輸艦八雲丸、三八二號運輸艦大文丸、二三六號運輸艦大國丸、二七號運輸艦Tocoma　Maru等四艘相檵駛滬、分靠大阪黃浦兩碼頭、當又有敵一部援軍合約五千人、相繼登陸、分别開楊樹浦、市中心區、轉楊行、羅店一帶、補充及增援該方面敵軍、綜計敵第四次增援部隊之巳抵滬者、已在二萬五千人以上、敵於昨日起、雖巳開始再度反攻、奈我早有準備、敵決難得逞云、</p>
<h3>敵強東北靑年作戰</h3>
<p>中央社南京二十七日電、軍息、據淞滬前方某師長報稱、前在虬江碼頭一帶作戰、當我部奮勇衝鋒、與敵接近時、聽敵方說啊、多有東北人口音、經問“我們同為中國人、為何受敵驅使、自相殘殺、何不携械來歸啊、該兵等當答曰、“我們何嘗願意、無奈受人壓迫、不能自由、不來當兵、則殺全家、就是來當兵、如有背叛行為、亦殺全家”等語、竊思倭寇肆虐、東北淪陷、我同胞日在敵鐵蹄蹂躪之下、動輒全家被殺、亡國之慘、實難言喩、敵人狠毒為心、強驅東北靑年壯士、用作箕燃、進必死於陣前、退則戮其家族、其用心在殺盡東北靑年、使全東北人民自斃不止、擬請通知全國各界、咸以東北同胞處境為鑒、當聞雞起舞、作鐵血之奮鬥、切勿觀望苟安、致有後悔等語、査敵軍壓迫東北靑年、驅赴前綫作戰、已誌前報、觀於某師長之報吿、更可證實前傳之不誣矣、</p>
<h3>美僑談日本箝制輿論近態</h3>
<p>虛偽宣傳設計籠絡回國日僑　徵兵操切抱怨原料缺乏維艱</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美人某君、頃由日本歸來、據謂每一載兵火車駛離日本之城鎮時、輒有多數民衆、至車站歡送、蓋由警察勒令每戶派山數人、至車站送行也、其中若干、</p>
<p>殊覺冷淡</p>
<p>而無熱誠、但靑年擁護戰爭、其狀若狂、當局戰事之宣傳、似已發生效果矣、日本普通人民、向來服從政府、但因政府徵兵過事操切、雖年逾五十者、在通知書發出後、極短時間內、卽須入伍、故亦不免抱怨、有自由思想之份子、頗不贊成政府之政策、惟因</p>
<p>警署監視</p>
<p>嚴密、偵探密布全國、東京一處、担任此種監視工作者、共有六七百人之多、故皆不敢微露其反對意見、若干外僑、其態度為當局認為不友好者、輒有偵探向詢對於日本在華作戰及日本對外政策之意見、雖非定須作答、但如予以拒絕、卽立處於嫌疑之地位、故許多外人對此、</p>
<p>頗費躊躇</p>
<p>至於日本國內發生革命一節、因現無衆望齊歸之領袖、一時似無實現之可能、議會自由派之議員、均被脅迫贊助其政府之政策、此次戰事、似至少能進行兩年、而無國內發生巨變之虞、日本各報、均承認今日華軍之戰鬥力、遠非往日、戰事不易速了、惟對於日軍至小之勝利、亦舖張極甚、記日軍之損失、則渺乎其微、其記日軍擊落中華飛機之多、與日兵陣亡之人數相埒、其記日飛機之轟炸、從不言殃及平民、僅言所擊中者、均屬要害、故日本民衆讀報者、</p>
<p>毫不能知</p>
<p>中國平民所受痛苦之眞相、報中記日兵勇武之新聞、觸目皆是、且載有華北日兵、以糧食興藥品給予難民之照片、此外尚描寫華兵之飢困狀况、及所獲俘虜之如何半飢、其手段亦云幼稚極矣、日交報紙當然完全贊助對華之戰事、四種英文日報、則受嚴厲之檢査、日本紀事報常載精闢之社論、但所得關於中國之消息、</p>
<p>百之八十</p>
<p>為檢査員禁載、日本廣知報、為東京美人所辦之唯一報紙、則以阿諛日政府為務、從不敢稍逆之、大阪每日新聞之英文刋、日人多讀之、日本時報則受外務省之津貼、後二報為日人所辦、對政府自唯命是從也、目前日本全國、因作戰之故、商業頗旺、收稅亦豐、但商家甚以不能購得充分之原料為苦、織布廠已感覺棉花之缺乏、購買原料所需之外匯、亦不易得、日本除至少暫時失去中國之市塲外、而</p>
<p>南洋日貨</p>
<p>銷數、亦有驚人之低落、此日商所大爲焦灼者、蓋南洋各島之華商、現已不復購銷日貨矣、日人視英國為日貸推銷最大之障碍、而英人對於中國事務態度、較前堅决、故仇對英國、日見深切、且因荷屬東印度取締日貨之入口、故亦蓄恨於心、此足徵日人對於經濟因素重視之一斑、日人目前對美之態度、則比較良好、美政府此次對於中日戰爭、事事出以謹慎、與史汀生昔日對滿洲爭案所取之政策、逈不相同、故日人皆沾沾自喜、美國不干涉政策、日人甚予贊同、獨恐</p>
<p>中立法案</p>
<p>一旦實施、將使日本遭遇困難、蓋棉鐵等原料、為日本急需者、似皆將列入禁品也、日本各報登載各國輿論、僅擇利於日本者用之、餘悉删削、認為受中國虛妄宣傳之惑、或指為乃注重私利者所發、其載在日外人之談片、往往大失其眞面目、使發言者</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>加緊募集救國公債</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>救國公債從開始募集以來。己經有一個月。　說應慕的數目還僅一萬五千萬元。照最初的計劃。這五萬萬元救國公債預備由海外華僑認二萬五千萬元。國內人民認二萬五千萬元的。假若這計劃中的華僑担負部分。果能如數募足。那末。五萬萬元的救國公債現在差不多只缺一萬萬元。就可以大功告了。然而事實是不是就能那樣容易呢。恐怕還未必盡然。我們知道預計由華僑負担的部份。至今尚無消息。至於國內人民已应募的一萬五千萬元。大部分是官應商店團體的認購額眞正由民間自動應募的數目可以說是很少。而這此官應商店等所認購的恐怕也都不能一次繳款。因為這種種關係所以據最近的報道。救國公債發行一個月來。官收還不過只有六百萬元而已。</p>
<p>這種救國公債的不易募集與北說是因為中國人民的不愛國。毌寗說是因為中国人民沒有這種自由應募公債的習慣。中國過去發了幾十年的公債。差不多不會呌人民來自動應募過現在一日要呌人民來做這樣一種沒有習慣的事。而還要望牠能得到一個很良好的結果。這當然是很難的。因此。我門現在對於救國公債的不能很快募足。並不需要表示如何的悲觀。在這裏。除掉再努力宣傳勸募以外。我們覺得對於救國公債發行的方式。似乎有部分改過的必要。</p>
<p>很顯然的。抗戰是需要金錢。而且是立刻需耍金錢。像現在這個緩慢的自由公債。是斷不能負起這個使命。的換言之。我們目前的發行救國公債。假若完全拋案了强制公債的方式而不用。那對於迅速擭得金錢的這個目標。是不容易達到的。因此。我們覺得救國公債的發行。自由與强制的二種方式。有並採並用的必要。同時。也是改善目前救國公債遲遲不易募集的一個辦法。</p>
<p>關於救國公債的强制承募。不僅是限於個人。同時。對於團體也應該强制其應募。㊀在個人方。强制的標準是財產之若干分之若干。可以責令全國地方官廳。按照標準。强制有錢人民應募救國公債。這種方式。對於慣於苛捐攤派的我國人民。是不會怎樣驚異。同時。也不會怎樣反對的。不過。這裹有一點很重要的。就是對於達官貴人的大財產家。不應該讓它們逃出這個强制。否則。這就是政府對下住人民。㊁在團骼方面。除善團以外。可以依資本或基金額來强制承募。這裹。尤其應該注意於過去承受公債的銀行。我們知道。過去銀行的承受公債。不但得到利息。而且還有著不可言喻之巨大發行折扣。因此。過去銀行從政府所得到的好處。已不少了。現在在這個國家民族危急存亡的時候。政府强制銀行來承募救國公債。可以說是天公地道。救國公債的募集。假若能够這樣從自由與强制二方面並進。莫說五萬萬元。就是十萬萬元也沒有什麼問題罷。</p>

<h3>劉行戰事漸趨沉寂我軍扼守永安橋陣地</h3>
<p>羅店方面有小股敵軍分頭騷擾　江灣閘北雙方有炮戰澈宵未停</p>
<p>自昨晚以迄今晨、全綫無大部隊步兵之接觸、但雙方炮戰殊極猛烈、敵飛機亦極活動、作漫無目的之投彈、然我軍陣地及其他軍事上工事、則毫無損失、永安橋附近一帶戰事、昨晚亦漸趨沉寂、我軍固守永安橋陣地、敵經此挫敗、最短期內似無力反攻、至羅店方面近數日戰况、亦祇有雙方小部隊之衢突、我憑險固守、敵殊無法衝破我軍防綫也、江灣閘北方面澈宵砲戰未停、敵步兵畏死、始終未敢出動、我陣綫不變、且仍維持優勢、浦江敵艦今晨拂曉、又砲擊我浦東陣地、我亦還擊、移時卽止、敵四次援軍連日已大部份抵灑、據乘輪經吳淞來滬者談、由吳淞至楊樹浦沿岸、遍地均是新到日軍、戰馬千百成羣、運輸忙碌、似夜積極配備整理中、全綫進犯、或尚有待、</p>
<p>今晨有某參謀自羅店來滬、與記者談前綫作戰情形、茲爲摭述一二、㊀敵軍困守一隅、迄今亳無發展、昨日全綫總攻、又遭慘敗、羅店旣無進展、劉行又迭次失利、現採聲東擊西戰略、故江灣閘北方面、形勢稍爲緊張、㊁羅店一綫、我方己築就新式强固工事、敵决無僥倖突進之可能、卽重兵器等亦難使用、近日江潮小汛、淺灘離岸甚遠、敵艦活動機會較少、沿江一帶、稍形平靜、㊂敵機昨午有數隊飛過羅店上空、並未投彈、後悉乃飛往嘉定西門肆虐、嘉豐紗廠及附近民房、頗受損失、㊃昨晨羅店以北長橋曹王廟一帶、鏖戰半日、砲火甚烈、我軍曾出壕衝擊、血戰半小時以上、敵潰退里許、遺屍四五十具、奪獲新式步槍四十餘桿、我方無甚損失、下午平驟無事、</p>
<h3>我堅守永安橋陣綫</h3>
<p>敵猛烈反攻遭受挫折</p>
<p>劉行之線、自我軍收復永安橋後、乘勝挺進、潰退敵軍、狼狽不堪、我軍收復各重要村落後、將敵軍所遺工事、趕加修築、昨晨拂曉、潰退之敵、捲土重來、對我永安橋一帶陣地、作猛烈之反攻、砲火掩護之外、敵機及坦克車、亦同時活動、我軍乘新勝餘威、奮勇迎戰、猛向敵軍撲擊、我方砲隊、亦向敵還擊、自晨至晚、激戰頗烈、入晚敵勢漸現不支、紛向後退、激戰稍息、午夜又有敵軍一股、企圖進犯、我軍早已準備、今晨已將敵繫退、現我軍堅守永安橋一帶陣地、異常堅固、敵軍决難再犯、</p>
<h3>小股敵軍騷擾羅店</h3>
<p>什九犧性於我軍機檢之下</p>
<p>羅店方面、敵軍昨月以時續時息之砲火、向我軍施相公廟一帶陣地、猛加轟擊外、復以小股敵軍百餘人、或五十餘人者數小隊、分向我軍陣地騷擾、我軍立起予以包圍猛擊、什九俱犧牲於我軍機槍掃射之下、敵屍狼藉、當搜得敵軍作戰計劃、重要交件及作戰地圖等、爲數甚多、足見羅店敵軍已黔驢技窮、心劳日拙矣、</p>
<h3>我猛攻江灣路敵軍</h3>
<p>斃敵甚多敵勢不支潰逃</p>
<p>中央社云、昨晚（二十七日）起、敵在江灣方面分三路進犯我持志大學陣地、我軍沉着應付、激戰終夜、至今晨零時三十分、經將敵陣衝散、始不支而退、我卽派機關槍隊由新市路追踪出擊、猛攻江灣路愛國女學敵軍陣地東首、密集掃射、斃敵甚多、敵勢不支、卽行後退、我亦不深進、至今晨三時、槍聲漸稀、僅有前哨之小接觸、</p>
<h3>敵艦炮轟浦東陣地</h3>
<p>毫無標的我絕未受損</p>
<p>今晨彿曉、浦江敵艦、向我浦東陣地頻頻發砲、毫無目的、肆意轟擊、</p>
<p>江灣各綫、昨日今晨、我敵兩軍、僅各砲火互相轟擊、並無其他變化、</p>
<h3>敵機又飛浦東轟炸</h3>
<p>飛經漕河涇開槍掃射難民　又至龍華擲彈均落田野中</p>
<p>敵機六架、今晨六時飛至浦東陸家嘴及爛泥渡其昌棧後、大肆轟炸、其聲之巨、卽浦西一帶星宇、亦被震動、先後計投十餘彈、我軍方面亳無損失、而民房受毀者亦少、僅墳墓之土坵被視爲防禦工事、炸成深潭者則有多處、民衆受傷者數人而已、旋敵機又在南黃浦一帶低飛掃射、並投下巨石多塊、但至十時許、第二次又往轟炸、民房頗有損傷、而南市方面亦有三架飛去偵察、惟未投彈、</p>
<p>又訊今日淸晨五時許、敵機二隊六架、由東楊樹浦一帶沿江飛往浦東南市上空繯繞、偵察良久、迨至八時許、該敵機一架則飛往浦東上空、餘五架竟飛往漕河涇、當時適有滬閔長途汽車載運難民經過該處滬閔南柘路、詎爲該敵機五架瞥見、竟卽低飛尾追、惟未投彈、施射機關槍、嗣竟追至一英里始息折返、而車上難民已飽受虛驚不淺、不料敵機復飛至龍華飛機塲上空、作漫無目標之轟炸、共投擲炸彈五枚、轟然巨聲、悉均落於附近田野中爆發、地泥被炸丈深窟窿、未有居民及市房受傷、故一無損失、嗣該敵機卽向東飛返、</p>
<h3>敵續到大批軍需品</h3>
<p>前日除有四運輸艦載來敵援軍一部五千人外、同時復另有第一三二號運輸艦喜福丸、第三高連丸、及上海丸等三艘駛到、分靠大阪招商局北棧及黃浦三碼頭、當有戰馬二百餘匹、六輪震鐵甲車五十餘輛、軍械及彈藥千餘箱、起卸上陸、至下午四時左右、喜福丸及上海丸、卽相纖駛出、高連丸仍泊招商局北棧、至日前駛滬之築後丸、因所裝軍火、尚未卸完、現仍停靠匯山碼頭云、</p>
<p>敵商輸改建之紅十字艦朝日丸、於前晨七時半復行到滬、停靠招商局北棧、除卸下大批救護藥品外、卽換載敵傷兵約八百人、於昨日午前十一時啟椗返國、觀此、敵方紅十字艦之往來頻繁、亦可想見敵軍傷亡之奇重矣、</p>
<h3>浦江敵艦戒備森嚴</h3>
<p>懼我轟炸艦上加堆沙袋</p>
<p>泊浦敵艦、被我浦東砲兵陣地發砲擊中者、已有多艘、現敵因連日來已有大批軍械彈藥及其他軍需品運到、故於前日起、已開始在各主要軍艦上加堆沙袋、增加高射砲及機關槍之配置、會遭我襲擊受有重傷停泊二號浮筒之敵司令艦出雲號、除於艦面滿堆高約丈餘之沙袋外、並於艦首艦尾各砌一圓形沙堆、上架高射砲前後各三架、於艦之兩側、機關槍之配置竟多至十餘架、此外又於艦之四週、停泊汽艇十餘艘、每艇亦裝有機關槍二枝、隨時往來游弋於該艦附近、藉資衛護、敵艦之小心翼翼、戒備森嚴、正所以表示我浦東砲兵陣地發砲準確也、</p>
<h3>國聯諮詢會通過决議譴責日軍轟炸平民</h3>
<p>此案在政治意義上極爲重要　國聯大會現有制裁日本可能</p>
<p>［日內瓦］國聯大會中日問題諮詢委員會、本日午後開會、接受英國外務次官克蘭波勛爵提議、一致通過决議案、對於日本飛機轟炸中國、並未設有防禦工事、各城市一事、嚴詞加以譴責、（中央社二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［日内瓦］國聯大會中日問題諮詢委員會、本日午後、舉行公開會議、主席拉脫維亞國外交部長蒙德施、美國觀察員卽駐瑞士公使哈利遜、與澳洲代表勃魯斯亦均在場、當由中國代表、卽駐法大使顧維鈞博士、發表演說、稱日本飛機轟炸中國平民、違反國際公法、與人道主義各項基本原則、國聯會至少應加以譴責、並予中國以鼓勵、以冀制北戰爭、英國外務次官克蘭波勛爵、當卽建議、對於日本飛機轟炸中國並未設有防禦工事各城市一事、加以譴責、法國外長台爾博斯·瑞典外長散特婁·蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫、均表贊同、至是委員會宣告延會、將决議案草成、旋卽復會、經長時間討論後、卒乃一致予以通過、並當提付國聯大會通過之、决議案內容係謂、“本委員會、頃用紧急程序、討論日本空軍轟炸中國並未設有防禦工事各城市一項問題、當因中國無辜平民慘遭炸斃、多數婦孺、亦在其例、極爲震動、此在全世界人士、亦莫不憤激而加以唾棄、本委員會茲特宣布、日本空軍此種行爲、無可寬宥、並鄭重加以譴責”云、（中央社二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［日內瓦］國聯大會中日問題諮詢委員會、本日通過决議案之後、國聯會人士頃加以評論、謂其內容明白指斥日本從事侵略行動、致使中國平民死傷數以萬計、此在政治上意義、極爲重要云、（中央社二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］國聯大會中日問題諮詢委員會通過决議案之後、英國消息靈通人士頃宣稱、决議案內容、明自指斥日本、不稍諱飾、以故國聯大會、或當提出建議、主張對於日本實施制裁辦法、亦未可必、英國是否參加共事、當視美國態度以爲斷、特截至目前爲止、美國對於採取共同行動、以對付日本一項主張、並不十分贊成耳、此外、據日內瓦方面消息稱、美國行當接受參加太平洋各國會議、英國消息靈通人士、則因美國一向並不贊成此事、故聞訊之餘、頗爲詫異（中央社二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英國各報提倡抵制日貨</h3>
<p>各黨報紙一致主張　各團體亦通過决議</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>亞聲電台捐款舞弊案。其中情形若何。當局應嚴重根究。</p>
<p>現當長期抗戰中。後方經濟的需求。原不亞於前綫英勇戰士們的軍火。因而茍有揭　“講款救國”的名義者。在國人無不慷慨樂輸。在當局亦未便加以制止。而“趁火打劫”之舉。不免因此發生。</p>
<p>在此國家民族危急存亡關頭。而竟有此“趁火打劫”行爲。若輩之絕無心肝幾與漢奸無異。漢奸貪圖敵人之利以禍國。若輩利用國禍機會以肥己。則其罪或更甚於漢奸。故此種“趁火打劫”行爲。若一經查明證實。應興漢奸同科。否則因以爲利者。將日益增多也。</p>
<p>若輩雖未完全吞沒而亦有一部份歸公。若輩明知盡入私囊。必易爲人發覺。故不得不掉出其一部份。以爲掩耳盜鈴之計。所謂假端歙錢。幸災樂禍。卽是此輩。喪心病狂。令人髮指。</p>
<p>在此時期。政府雖無暇加以注意。在國人應稍具天良。而一般民衆。亦應起而嚴密監察隨時舉發。此亦人民應有之責任也。</p>

<h3>The Enemy's Attacks on All Fronts Have Been Unsuccessful; Our Troops Continue to Advance at Yong'an Bridge</h3>
<p>Our Troops Control Kangjia Lane and Shenjia Residence; Our Troops Bravely Repel the Enemy at Baoshan Road and Baziqiao; Fierce Fighting Raged All Day Yesterday Northwest of Luodian</p>
<p>This newspaper received the following battle reports from various fronts at 2:00 AM this morning: ❶ Luodian Front: Starting at dawn yesterday, enemy forces launched a full-scale attack on our positions from the line north of Changqiao to Caowang Temple. Both land and air forces were deployed simultaneously. Their infantry was equipped with light and heavy weapons, led by tanks, and advanced towards our front-line positions under the three-dimensional bombing of artillery and aircraft. Our front-line troops calmly responded and did not yield. Our artillery positions also densely bombarded the enemy with heavy artillery, hindering their advance. The front line saw extremely fierce fighting, with bloody charges occurring more than a dozen times. The fighting raged all day, and both sides suffered extremely heavy casualties. As of midnight, the battle was still raging. ❷ Liuhang Front: After our troops recovered Yong'an Bridge, they took advantage of the victory to continue advancing towards the Yanghang line. The enemy also urgently dispatched reinforcements from Yanghang and Xinzhen, thickening their forces and stubbornly resisting. As of about 10:00 PM last night, fierce fighting was still taking place in the area about one kilometer east of Yong'an Bridge. Due to the victory, our troops' morale was greatly boosted, and the enemy forces were afraid to advance, with their positions gradually wavering. Our side held an extremely advantageous position. ❸ Zhabei to Jiangwan Line: Starting yesterday evening, the enemy launched attacks on three fronts: one from Xiangyin Road, aiming for Chih Chih University; one from Jiangwan Road, aiming for the area west of Baziqiao to Fangjia Muqiao; and one from the east side of the Commercial Press, aiming for Baoshan Road. Each route was covered by several tanks. Our troops met and fiercely attacked them on each front. As of midnight, the enemy on Baoshan Road and Baziqiao had been repelled by us. However, on the Jiangwan Road front, fierce fighting was still taking place near Chih Chih University.</p>
<h3>Continuing the Advance from Yong'an Bridge, Our Troops Reached Shenjia Residence</h3>
<p>Taking Advantage of the Enemy's Unsteadiness, a Swift Advance; Enemy Soldiers Lay Dead Everywhere, Unable to Resist and Retreating</p>
<p>Liuhang Front: After our troops routed the enemy in the Battle of Jinjiawan, they took advantage of the victory to advance along the highway. The enemy forces were utterly defeated and retreated towards Yanghang. Our troops then recovered Yong'an Bridge and continued to advance in successive stages, pursuing the enemy. The night before last, they had advanced to Kangjia Lane northeast of Yong'an Bridge and West Shenjia Residence. After a fierce battle in that area, the enemy was routed. The night before last, the enemy launched a fierce counterattack against our troops. Several tanks repeatedly covered their infantry's charge, but they were all repelled by our artillery fire. Enemy aircraft were also very active in the air, dropping bombs on our positions. Enemy warships in the Baoshan River also fired heavy artillery to assist in the battle. The sea, land, and air forces launched an attack simultaneously, and although the attack was fierce, our brave soldiers rose up to meet it. Despite being under enemy artillery fire, they charged forward and engaged in the most intense hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. After a bloody battle all night, by dawn yesterday, enemy soldiers lay dead everywhere, unable to resist and retreating. After a brief respite, the enemy replenished their forces with reinforcements and attacked again. Our troops continued their efforts and dealt them a heavy blow.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after our troops recovered the important location of Yong'an Bridge on the 26th, they took advantage of the victory to pursue closely behind the enemy, not giving them a chance to catch their breath. Our troops advanced rapidly, and the enemy was unable to retreat in time, leading to fierce close-quarters combat. The enemy fought and retreated, and by evening, we had advanced about one kilometer to the northeast, seizing the two villages of Kangjia Lane and Shenjia Residence. We set up a defensive line, and the enemy also used tanks as temporary defensive structures to stubbornly hold their ground. As of yesterday morning (the 27th), the fighting had not yet ceased. Enemy warships frequently bombarded with heavy artillery, and enemy aircraft also flew low to strafe with machine guns to assist in the battle. Our troops calmly coped with the enemy's sea, land, and air assault, preventing the enemy from attacking lightly.</p>
<h3>We Encircle the Enemy at Shuiding Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 4:00 AM, in the dim morning light, the enemy at Aiguo Girls' School, covered by three tanks, advanced towards our positions at Chih Chih University on Shuiding Road with two platoons of infantry. Our defending troops, seeing the enemy's fierce advance, immediately avoided a frontal engagement and encircled them from both the left and right flanks, using concentrated firepower to annihilate the enemy. At the same time, our artillery also bombarded the enemy positions at Aiguo Girls' School. The enemy's forward sentries and following infantry lost contact with each other. Our troops bravely attacked, killing more than twenty enemy soldiers. By around 7:00 AM, the enemy forces were unable to withstand the attack and retreated towards Aiguo Girls' School.</p>
<h3>Enemy Vessels Reconnoiter the Pudong Ports</h3>
<p>Starting at 2:00 AM yesterday morning, enemy motorboats adopted a guerrilla warfare strategy, moving back and forth in the center of the Huangpu River, reconnoitering the various ports in Pudong, and occasionally firing with machine guns. Once our troops returned fire, the enemy soldiers, fearing death, immediately fled. At dawn yesterday morning, our troops and the enemy again exchanged heavy artillery fire, sometimes sporadically and sometimes densely. By 8:00 AM, three enemy aircraft flew to the skies over Pudong to assist in the battle, dropping bombs, but with no targets, the effect was negligible. From yesterday to today before noon, enemy warships only fired a shell every few tens of minutes. Judging by their cowardly actions in recent days, the dream of occupying Pudong has long been extinguished.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Launched Attacks on Three Routes; Fierce Fighting Last Night in Jiangwan and Zhabei</h3>
<p>Attempting to Breach Our Lines, an Unprecedented Fierce Battle Occurred; Our Troops Fought Bravely, the Enemy Was Defeated</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, while enemy aircraft were dropping bombs in the Zhabei area, enemy forces in the Jiangwan city center area were moving quite busily. Our troops learned from reconnaissance reports that the enemy was about to attack again, so they ordered the entire line to be on strict alert. At 7:00 PM, the enemy, as expected, used a force of more than one regiment, covered by more than ten tanks, to attack our positions on Tiyuhui Road along Xiangyin Road. Our troops fought bravely, and an unprecedented fierce battle broke out. About half an hour later, another enemy company attacked our North Station area. Our troops swept them with machine guns, killing many enemy soldiers. After holding out for only a quarter of an hour, the enemy retreated, knowing that it was difficult. Around 8:00 PM, a large number of enemy troops were also discovered at Chih Chih University, Guangdong Middle School, and Baziqiao, launching a joint attack with part of the enemy forces on Xiangyin Road. For a time, the sound of artillery roared, mixed with the sound of rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades. After the city fell silent at night, it was especially clear. This time, the enemy used a force of more than one regiment to attack on multiple routes, seemingly with the ambition to break through our positions there in one fell swoop. However, our troops were well prepared and their morale was high. By late at night, the enemy had made no progress.</p>
<h3>Our Artillery Bombarded Enemy Positions</h3>
<p>The Artillery Fire from Both Sides Was Fierce Beyond Precedent; Enemy Aircraft Bombed Zhabei, Only Destroying Civilian Houses; Small Enemy Units Harassed Us and Were Fiercely Attacked by Us</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, the enemy forces, because newly arrived reinforcements had arrived to take over the defense, began to stir restlessly again and attacked our entire line. At the same time, starting at 5:00 AM yesterday morning, they used their artillery positions in the city center area to bombard the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas with heavy artillery in an indiscriminate manner. At that time, our artillery units in Pudong and [illegible] also immediately retaliated and frequently bombarded the enemy's base area in Hongkou. Because our gunners measured the targets accurately,</p>
<p>The Enemy Suffered Extremely Heavy Damage</p>
<p>The density of the artillery fire from both sides was truly astonishing. As a result, apart from slight damage to civilian houses, there were no other effects on our side. The enemy then sent six aircraft in squads to reconnoiter in the Zhabei area, hoping to spy on our positions. At about 8:30 AM, they continuously dropped more than ten heavy bombs in the Zhabei area. The sound of the violent explosions shook the entire city. Some houses in the Baoshan Road area caught fire and burned, with black smoke rising straight into the sky. At this time, small units of enemy forces from the North Sichuan Road area took the opportunity to attack Dongxinmin Road, Qiujiang Road, Baoshan Road, and other places. Our troops, seeing that they were approaching, immediately swept them with machine guns and automatic rifles. The enemy, seeing that our side was prepared, immediately fled. However, their reconnaissance and bombing aircraft still hovered without leaving until 11:00 AM, when they quietly left the area. Before long, they came again and dropped six bombs near North Sichuan Road and Guangdong Street. Their small units took the opportunity to attack again. As a result,</p>
<p>They Were Still Repelled by Our Troops</p>
<p>Then the enemy artillery began to bombard again, but the enemy artillery's technology was too immature, resulting in a shell falling on the stack house of Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill near West Suzhou Road and Yichang Road. The roof was destroyed, but fortunately no one was injured. At about 1:00 PM, the enemy again used a small unit to attack our positions half a mile east of Lingnan Road and Yuexiu Road. At that time, our troops immediately rose up to resist, and after about half an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy finally collapsed and retreated. The enemy then repeatedly turned towards the North Station area and the Baoshan Road area to provoke us. At the same time, their artillery positions also turned to that area and fired indiscriminately. Although several shells fell in the fields, our troops remained calm and concentrated machine gun fire, densely sweeping the enemy positions, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. At about 2:00 PM, the enemy collapsed and retreated, but their artillery bombardment continued to fire indiscriminately, while our artillery also retaliated closely with</p>
<p>Heavy Artillery</p>
<p>The enemy had no opportunity to take advantage of, so they sent their aircraft to continue reconnaissance in the Zhabei area and randomly dropped heavy bombs, but our positions were absolutely not targeted and were bombarded by us with anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns, posing a great threat to the enemy aircraft, which fled in a panic. At the same time, our artillery even used concentrated firepower to bombard the enemy positions, with many direct hits, so the enemy's losses were quite heavy. The artillery fire from both sides gradually thinned out after 4:00 PM. As for Pudong, at about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, three enemy aircraft also flew to the skies over Pudong to hover and reconnoiter for about a quarter of an hour. At that time, all the enemy warships parked in the Yangshupu area</p>
<p>Fired on Our Pudong</p>
<p>The artillery fire was very dense. Our troops stationed there, in addition to retaliating closely, also fired anti-aircraft machine guns into the air. The enemy aircraft fled in a panic, and the enemy artillery also stopped immediately. After that, enemy aircraft flew to Pudong several times to reconnoiter, but the enemy warships did not continue to fire. Our artillery positions in Pudong bombarded the enemy positions in the Yangshupu area intermittently with heavy artillery yesterday, causing considerable damage to the enemy.</p>
<h3>We Constructed a Net of Fire, Killing Two Hundred Enemy Soldiers</h3>
<p>Luodian Front: At a certain key transportation point that our troops had captured some days ago, anticipating that the enemy would have to launch a full-scale attack sooner or later, we actively built defensive fortifications and set up machine guns at hidden locations on both sides, aiming at the intersection to form a "net of fire" formation. Unexpectedly, at dusk the day before yesterday, the enemy did launch a full-scale attack, first using aircraft and artillery to cover the attack, followed by about 300 enemy soldiers, who rushed in fiercely. Our troops waited until they rushed into the net of fire before opening fire with concentrated fire. More than two hundred enemy soldiers were shot and fell to the ground, while the rest fled in a panic. When searching the abandoned corpses, we obtained many enemy flags from small squads within the regiment, which belonged to the Sato unit of the enemy's 11th Division. One diary of a squad leader recorded that the Chinese army fought bravely and the Japanese side's future was bleak.</p>
<p>Luodian Front: After our troops recovered Jinjiazha, they firmly defended the enemy's defensive fortifications, and the entire line remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Launched Bombs Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>From 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM yesterday morning, another nine enemy aircraft, divided into teams of three, reconnoitered in various parts of the city and dropped three bombs near Dananmen in Nanshi.</p>
<p>Yesterday at dawn, three enemy aircraft took off from the Yangshupu area and invaded our Zhabei skies at about 6:00 AM, reconnoitering and dropping bombs on our positions there. Our garrison fired anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns at the enemy aircraft. The enemy aircraft still hovered without leaving, but did not dare to fly low. The bombs they dropped did not hit the target, only destroying a few civilian houses, with no other losses. Around 11:00 AM, enemy aircraft flew over Zhabei skies for the second time and were also shot at by our troops with concentrated firepower. The enemy aircraft fled in a panic.</p>
<p>At about 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, enemy aircraft came again to hover over our positions in Zhabei, coming and going from time to time, arbitrarily dropping bombs. They did not fly away until late in the afternoon. Our troops shot at them with anti-aircraft machine guns, but the enemy aircraft did not dare to fly low. The bombs they dropped were aimless, and our positions suffered very little damage.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Air Force Has Increased Greatly</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a Westerner from Yangshupu said that the enemy has converted the old golf course east of the Gonda Cotton Mill at the end of Yangshupu Road into a temporary airfield, which is very large in scale. He also saw more than two hundred enemy aircraft parked at the airfield. From this, it can be seen that in addition to actively replenishing troops and military supplies in recent days, the enemy has also greatly increased its air force.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th: Military sources say that the enemy aircraft that have bombed our Jinghu line for days are being operated by the 3rd and 4th Naval Air Squadrons, commanded by Wada, and led by Takahashu Shirao and Lieutenant Yamashita (Editor's note: Yamashita has been captured in Taicang).</p>
<h3>Another Five Thousand Enemy Reinforcements Have Arrived</h3>
<p>The enemy's fourth reinforcement army, composed of a mixed division and a brigade, totaling approximately 40,000 men, has seen about 20,000 men continue to land at various docks in the eastern Shanghai area in recent days. Yesterday afternoon, starting at 1:00 PM, four enemy merchant ships converted into troop transports, No. 334 Yagumo Maru, No. 382 Daimon Maru, No. 236 Daikoku Maru, and No. 27 Tocoma Maru, successively sailed to Shanghai, berthing at the Osaka and Huangpu wharves. At that time, another part of the enemy's reinforcements, approximately 5,000 men, successively landed and were transferred to the Yangshupu, city center, Yanghang, and Luodian areas to supplement and reinforce the enemy forces in those areas. In total, the enemy's fourth reinforcement force that has arrived in Shanghai is already more than 25,000 men. Although the enemy has begun to launch a counterattack again since yesterday, because we were prepared, it will be difficult for the enemy to succeed.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Forces Northeastern Youths to Fight</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th: Military sources say that a certain division commander on the Songhu front reported that during the fighting near the Qiujiang wharf, when our troops bravely charged and approached the enemy, they heard many Northeastern accents among the enemy forces. They asked, "We are all Chinese, why are you being driven by the enemy to slaughter each other? Why don't you bring your weapons and return to us?" The soldiers replied, "We don't want to, but we are oppressed and cannot be free. If we don't come to be soldiers, our whole family will be killed. Even if we come to be soldiers, if we betray, our whole family will also be killed." It is thought that the Japanese bandits are rampant, the Northeast has fallen, and our compatriots are being trampled under the enemy's iron hooves every day. At every turn, the whole family is killed. The tragedy of national subjugation is difficult to describe. The enemy is vicious and drives Northeastern youths to use them as cannon fodder, who must die on the battlefield if they advance and whose families will be killed if they retreat. Their intention is to kill all Northeastern youths, causing all Northeastern people to commit suicide. It is proposed to notify all sectors of the country to take the plight of Northeastern compatriots as a lesson, and to rise up at the crowing of the rooster to fight with iron and blood, and not to sit idly by and wait for safety, lest there be regret. It has been noted in previous reports that the enemy army oppresses Northeastern youths and drives them to the front lines to fight. The report of a certain division commander further confirms that the previous reports were not false.</p>
<h3>American Resident Discusses Recent State of Japanese Opinion Control</h3>
<p>False Propaganda Designed to Co-opt Returning Japanese Residents; Hasty Conscription, Complaints of Difficulty Due to Lack of Raw Materials</p>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, an American who recently returned from Japan said that every time a troop train leaves a Japanese city or town, many people go to the station to see it off, because the police have ordered each household to send several people to the station. Some of them</p>
<p>Feel Quite Indifferent</p>
<p>And lack enthusiasm, but the youths support the war as if they are mad. The authorities' propaganda about the war seems to have had an effect. The average Japanese people have always been obedient to the government, but because the government's conscription is too hasty, even those over fifty years old must enlist in a very short time after receiving the notice, so they cannot help but complain. Those with liberal ideas do not approve of the government's policies, but because</p>
<p>Police Surveillance</p>
<p>Is strict, and detectives are densely distributed throughout the country. There are six or seven hundred people in Tokyo alone who are responsible for this kind of surveillance work, so they do not dare to reveal their opposition. Some foreigners whose attitudes are considered unfriendly by the authorities are questioned by detectives about their opinions on Japan's war in China and Japan's foreign policy. Although they are not required to answer, if they refuse, they are immediately placed under suspicion. Therefore, many foreigners are</p>
<p>Quite Hesitant</p>
<p>As for the possibility of a revolution occurring in Japan, because there is no leader who is universally admired, it seems unlikely to happen in the short term. Liberal members of parliament have been coerced into supporting the government's policies. This war seems likely to continue for at least two years, without any risk of a major upheaval occurring domestically. Japanese newspapers all acknowledge that the fighting power of the Chinese army today is far greater than in the past, and that the war will not be easy to end quickly. However, they exaggerate even the smallest victories of the Japanese army, and their reports of Japanese losses are minimal. Their reports of the number of Chinese aircraft shot down by the Japanese army are on par with the number of Japanese soldiers killed. Their reports of Japanese aircraft bombings never mention that civilians were affected, only saying that the targets hit were all critical points. Therefore, Japanese newspaper readers</p>
<p>Cannot Know</p>
<p>The truth about the suffering of Chinese civilians. News about the bravery of Japanese soldiers is everywhere in the newspapers, and there are also photos of Japanese soldiers in North China providing food and medicine to refugees. In addition, they depict the hunger and poverty of Chinese soldiers and how half-starved the captured prisoners are. Their methods are also extremely naive. Japanese newspapers, of course, fully support the war against China. The four English-language newspapers are subject to strict censorship. The Japan Chronicle often carries incisive editorials, but</p>
<p>Eighty Percent</p>
<p>Of the news about China that it obtains is forbidden to be published by the censors. The Japan Advertiser, the only newspaper in Tokyo run by Americans, is dedicated to flattering the Japanese government and never dares to go against it in the slightest. The English edition of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun is read by many Japanese people. The Japan Times is subsidized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The latter two newspapers are run by Japanese people and are of course obedient to the government. Currently, Japan as a whole is experiencing a boom in commerce and high tax revenue due to the war, but merchants are very troubled by their inability to purchase sufficient raw materials. Textile factories are already feeling the lack of cotton, and the foreign exchange needed to purchase raw materials is also not easy to obtain. In addition to at least temporarily losing the Chinese market,</p>
<p>Sales of Japanese Goods in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>Have also experienced an alarming decline. This is a great source of anxiety for Japanese merchants, as Chinese merchants in the various islands of Southeast Asia are no longer purchasing Japanese goods. The Japanese regard Britain as the biggest obstacle to the sale of Japanese goods, and the British attitude towards Chinese affairs is more resolute than before, so hatred of Britain is deepening. They also harbor resentment towards the Dutch East Indies for restricting the import of Japanese goods. This is enough to show the importance that the Japanese attach to economic factors. The Japanese attitude towards the United States at present is relatively good. The US government has been cautious in everything it has done in the Sino-Japanese War, which is very different from the policy taken by Stimson in the Manchurian Incident. Therefore, the Japanese are all complacent. The Japanese greatly approve of the US non-intervention policy, but are only afraid that the</p>
<p>Neutrality Act</p>
<p>Once implemented, it will cause difficulties for Japan, as raw materials such as cotton and iron, which are urgently needed by Japan, seem likely to be included in the list of prohibited items. Japanese newspapers publish opinions from various countries, only choosing those that are beneficial to Japan and deleting the rest, claiming that they are influenced by China's false propaganda or that they are issued by those who focus on their own private interests. The talk pieces of foreigners in Japan are often greatly distorted, causing the speakers to</p>
<p>Feel Quite Distressed</p>
<p>The news published in Japanese newspapers generally has two or three different editions, one for sale in the country, one for sale abroad, and perhaps even one for sale in China. Their intentions are also quite painstaking. The return of Japanese residents in China is a thorny problem for the Japanese government, as the return of many residents from enemy countries is a form of unfavorable propaganda. Therefore, the authorities ordered newspapers to begin publishing the speeches of those returning home, to express their patriotic enthusiasm and to advise those who have abandoned their families and businesses to return home to wait patiently for the Emperor's grace. After the war ends, after returning to China, they will be able to obtain even better businesses.</p>
<p>(Translator's note: The two essential elements for winning a war are the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers on the front lines and the solidarity of the people in the rear. Both are indispensable. This Sino-Japanese War is not about the gains or losses of one place, but about the survival of the nation and the life and death of the people. The loyalty and bravery of the soldiers on the front lines has already been witnessed. It is hoped that the people in the rear will work hard to achieve solidarity so that they can hold out against the enemy for a long time in order to win the final victory. In all fairness, Japan's education has been developing for many years. Although its warlords are rampant and lawless, its people are also deeply aware of the serious consequences of defeat, so they will have to make the best of it and support their government. Although the war situation may become irreparable in the future, it will inevitably collapse, but it will not be easy to achieve in the short term. Therefore, we must not rely on luck and be negligent, but must continue to actively contribute manpower, materials, and financial resources to the government and fight against the enemy, so that as long as the enemy does not stop, we will not stop for a day. Then the final victory will be guaranteed to belong to us.)</p>

<h3>Our Army Achieves a Great Victory in Northern Shanxi</h3>
<p>The Enemy at Pingxingguan Was Completely Defeated; The Enemy's Road to Lingqiu Was Cut Off; Our Troops Entered the Lingguang Road</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] After our army won a victory on the 23rd, the enemy dispatched a large army to attack. Our various routes launched a fierce attack, recovering Caijiayu and several important mountain peaks at noon on the 25th. They then divided into four routes to pursue the enemy, who were utterly defeated and suffered heavy casualties. The enemy's tanks, artillery vehicles, armored vehicles, and other heavy military equipment were mostly hidden in the mountain gullies near Laomiaoye. We are sending teams to pursue, search, and annihilate them. The enemy attacking Pingxingguan on the morning of the 25th recovered Guangou, Xindian, and Dongpaochi at 12:00, capturing more than 200 enemy soldiers and killing countless. They captured more than 50 armored vehicles, fully loaded with military supplies, and cut off the enemy's road to Lingqiu. They are now pursuing the enemy east of Yuanchengkou.</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Our army killed many enemies in Dongxi Paochi on the 25th. They were identified as the Suzuki Regiment, about one-third of whom were Japanese, one-third of whom were from the three northeastern provinces, and one-third of whom were Mongolian. The infantry and tanks were all Japanese, and the cavalry were mostly Mongolian. A part of our army entered the Lingguang Road on the afternoon of the 25th, cutting off the advance of the enemy's follow-up units. After our army recovered Caijiayu on the 25th, it immediately launched a fierce attack, completely destroying an enemy battalion in Xiaozhai Li in the afternoon, and raiding an enemy supply station, seizing countless military supplies. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>[Xi'an] This station recently received a telegram from Gao Guizi's division on the 26th, stating that the division had been fighting a bloody battle with the enemy at Pingxingguan Tuanchengkou for five days and nights since the 22nd. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, and our side also suffered considerable casualties. Fierce fighting is still underway. (Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>⊙ Fushi, Shenbao Hall, re: September 25th, our Eighth Route Army fought a fierce battle with more than 10,000 enemies at Pingxingguan in northern Shanxi, repeatedly charging forward. Our army fought bravely and directly, completely defeating the attacking enemy. All positions in the Xinzhuang Guansha Dongpaochi area north of Pingxingguan were completely captured. The enemy soldiers who were killed lay dead across the mountains and fields, and some were captured. Many captured cars, tanks, guns, cannons, and other military supplies are being inventoried. Currently, the remnants of the enemy have collapsed and retreated to Xiaozhai Village, and are being surrounded by us on all sides. Signed, Staff Office of the Eighth Route Army.</p>
<h3>General Commander Zhu De of the Eighth Route Army</h3>
<p>[Beiping] News from Lingqiu, northern Shanxi, indicates that Japanese troops have been fleeing towards Laiyuan on the Hebei-Shanxi border since the 26th. Japanese troops in Guangling appear to be retreating to Yuxian. (Quick News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily Mail" reporting news from Zhengzhou, based on observations of the Sino-Japanese battlefield, the main force of the Japanese army is currently increasing its offensive along the Pinghan Railway line. The Chinese army's position south of Baoding is gradually becoming strained. It is generally believed that once the Japanese army's offensive along this line stops, the overall situation will ease, as their losses have been heavy and they lack reinforcements to advance further. The Japanese army maintains approximately eight divisions of various troops along the Pinghan Railway. The exact number of troops deployed on the front lines and as reserves near Beiping and Tongzhou is unknown. However, observers in Beiping estimate it to be around two or three divisions. The Japanese army has advanced significantly along the Jinpu Railway, giving the Chinese army the opportunity to counterattack and penetrate their front lines. Chinese troops in this area frequently engage in combat with units ranging from 300 to 1,000 men, aiming to disrupt the Japanese army's transportation lines and the supply lines for troops fighting on both the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways. It is reported that the Chinese army is currently holding firm defensive positions south of Cangzhou, and this part of northern Hebei can be called the eastern section of the North China front, to distinguish it from the ongoing major battles in Shanxi province and on the Hebei-Shanxi border. The Japanese strategy seems to follow the pattern they employed previously in Manchuria. In the past, the Japanese army advanced along the railway lines in Manchuria, and because the Chinese army did not resist, they were able to advance rapidly and leave the work of consolidating the acquired territories for later. Now, the Chinese army's strategy on the North China front is to lure the enemy deep, then engage in fierce combat, inflict heavy casualties, and force them to retreat strategically. According to recent news, Baoding and Cangzhou have fallen into enemy hands, but because the overall defensive line of the Chinese army in Hebei seems to be south of these two places, their fall is said to be of no major consequence. The defense of the Suiyuan-Shanxi border is now showing significant developments. The outcome of the major battles on the Hebei-Shanxi border has resulted in the loss of over half of the advancing Japanese troops who attempted to reach the Chinese army's defensive positions in the mountains of northern Shanxi, along with a wide front. This army is said to be the Suzuki unit, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Itagaki. Some time ago, the situation in northern Shanxi, viewed from afar, was not critical, but it was already felt to be serious. However, according to investigations by those close to the battlefield, it is quite reassuring. This section of the front can be called the western section of North China, where the Japanese army is adopting a bold offensive strategy. At the beginning of the fighting, the Japanese army attacked Nankou, but after the unsuccessful attack on southern Hebei, the Kwantung Army attacked from the northeast from Duolun on the Jehol border, and threatened Zhangjiakou from the northwest. Using this tactic, the Chahar army, under the command of Liu Ruming, offered only slight resistance and retreated along the Ping-Sui Railway to Datong in northern Shanxi. Furthermore, they did not destroy the railway during the retreat, so the Japanese army was able to use this important transportation line. Only when they reached Xinghe on the Ping-Sui Line did they see that the railway had been completely destroyed, and the main force of Shanxi Province engaged them in battle. The morale of the Chahar army was boosted. The Chinese army commander seemed to be luring the enemy deep into the Datong plain, relying on the terrain to defeat the enemy. The Japanese army on this route consisted of infantry, cavalry, mechanized units, tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft. The main task of the Japanese army fighting in eastern Suiyuan and northeastern Shanxi was to attack from Xinghe into Huan Yuan to outflank the Chinese army in Shanxi. At this point, they split into two groups. The larger group continued along the route to Datong, which they occupied last week, while the second group, the Suzuki unit, headed south towards Hunyuan and Pingxingguan in the mountains of northern Shanxi. The group attacking Datong did not encounter strong resistance. The Suzuki unit, advancing through the mountains, failed to scout the enemy's situation and encountered difficulties. According to Chinese military commentators, the Japanese army in this area can be called a "dead army" and seems to have no chance of returning to Tokyo. This army was still trying to coordinate with the Japanese army advancing along the Pinghan Railway, but as a result, it was surrounded in the mountains of Hunyuan and Pingxingguan in northeastern Shanxi and suffered heavy losses, ceasing to be an effective force. According to recent news, 2,000 Japanese soldiers were captured and 3,000 killed. The reason for their failure seems to be that Itagaki mistakenly divided his army into several small groups, which were defeated individually in a vast area. The Japanese army's advance into Shanxi along the Ping-Sui Railway was clearly aimed at attacking Suiyuan from the south, and facing failure as with the attack from the east last autumn. Therefore, the larger army advancing towards Datong was divided into three groups: one heading north along the railway to Fengzhen in Suiyuan, one turning south to take a parallel line with the Suzuki unit, and then joining up to head towards Hunyuan and Pingxingguan, and one heading west along the highway, aiming to reach Guihua. The group heading north has passed Fengzhen and reached Pingdiquan, where it was blocked by Fu Zuoyi's army. This group may retreat east to escape across the desert and return to Zhangjiakou. The group heading south is currently engaged in battle with the Shanxi army and may suffer the same disastrous defeat as the Suzuki army. The group heading west made some progress from Datong but has been intercepted by a large number of cavalry and infantry in the Zuoling Mountains. This group is also in a dangerous situation, and its retreat route seems to be cut off. It is reported that the infantry fighting there is a unit famous for its guerrilla warfare. Generally, everyone knows that the fate of Hebei Province depends on the safety of Shanxi Province. Judging from the current battle situation in Shanxi, the Chinese army needed in that province must surpass the Japanese army currently fighting between the railways in Hebei Province.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attacked Nanjing Again Yesterday, Three Times Unsuccessfully</h3>
<p>Bombs were dropped in Baguazhou, Pukou, etc. - Guangdong again suffered brutal enemy bombing</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Enemy planes attacked Nanjing twice again on the 26th, causing huge damage to the lives and homes of civilians in Baguazhou and Pukou. The first attack involved eleven enemy planes, which came around 10 AM. They encountered our air force in Baguazhou, a suburb. The enemy planes did not penetrate into the city and dropped several bombs there before leaving. The second attack involved nine enemy planes, which flew in along the Shanghai-Nanjing line around 0:40 AM. They circled over Pukou for half an hour, dropping more than ten heavy bombs in total. The Jinpu Railway Bureau suffered considerable damage. Part of Pukou Elementary School and Rotary Elementary School were destroyed by the bombing. Many civilian houses at the Xiaonan River downstream dock and in Hecheng Street were destroyed, with over twenty people killed or injured, limbs flying and bodies torn apart, a horrifying sight. The enemy also dropped five bombs in the Sanwen River, 200 meters from the French warship, causing great indignation on the part of the French warship. After dropping the bombs, the enemy planes still attempted to penetrate into the city, but were unsuccessful due to the resistance of our air force, and turned back and flew away. At 1:10 PM, the nine enemy planes re-entered our alert zone, attempting a third attack, but were also repelled by our air force and air defense units. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] At 0:50 AM, a squadron of enemy planes detoured over the western suburbs, flying north along the Yuehan Railway, spying on our important transportation areas. At 3:10 AM, an enemy plane suddenly cut into the airspace over the city from the west, flying towards the northeastern suburbs, circling back and forth. At 3:35 AM, the enemy plane proceeded from the southeast towards the north of the city, reaching between Chang Geng Road and the foot of Yuexiu Mountain, and suddenly fired a volley of machine guns, sweeping downwards, with stray bullets whizzing through the air. At that time, our anti-aircraft machine gun teams also fired back upwards. The enemy plane, knowing that we were prepared, hastily flew high and fled eastward. Just as the citizens were about to go to bed, who knew that at 5:05 AM, enemy planes flew in from the north again, passing over the city and flying south, dropping bombs above Jiangcun station on the Yuehan Railway, and the alert was not lifted until 6:40 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] Ten enemy planes, in two squadrons, attacked for the third time on the morning of the 27th at 8:30 AM. One squadron of four planes flew into the city from the southwest, dropping three bombs at the southern station of the Yuehan Railway. One was an incendiary bomb, which landed outside the station's empty carriage depot and started a fire. Fortunately, the fire brigade arrived immediately and extinguished it. Chen Yujing, the head of the second branch of the sixth police precinct, was killed, and one police officer and one trainee were injured. One bomb landed near the Zheng Family Ancestral Hall west of the road, destroying more than 30 civilian houses, killing and injuring over a hundred people. The third bomb landed in front of a refuge outside the station, killing and injuring over twenty civilians seeking refuge. Reporters went to the scene of the damage to investigate, seeing the fire and rescue teams working in the rubble, carrying out rescue work. The faces of the people killed by the bombing were charred black and unrecognizable. Ordinary refugees, supporting the old and leading the young, overturned bricks and tiles, crying loudly to search for the remaining bones of their loved ones after the disaster. The other squadron of six planes flew along the Yuehan Railway and dropped bombs at Jiangcun Station, destroying a few workshops attached to the station and a bridge cave. Fortunately, no one was injured. Enemy planes dropped more than ten bombs at Yinzhan Ao, all of which landed in the wilderness, without hindering the railway traffic.

<p>[Guangzhou] Guangzhou was quickly attacked by Japanese planes twice today. The first time was just one Japanese plane before dawn. The second time was at 9:10 AM, with approximately thirteen Japanese planes participating in the attack. In a third air raid, five enemy planes flew over at 2:30 PM. The first time, two bombs were dropped, landing in open suburbs, only disturbing people's peaceful dreams. The second time, thirteen Japanese planes paid great attention to the Yuehan Railway, dropping many bombs at several places outside the city of Guangzhou, with the intention of destroying the railway traffic. Huangsha Station, only a few hundred yards from Shameen, was bombed with three bombs by a Japanese plane. Looking at the station buildings from afar afterwards, they did not seem to be greatly damaged. People believed that there were few civilian houses near the station, but some must have been destroyed, because the fire was quite fierce. There are often many people in the East Station area, and it is feared that there must have been many casualties. However, a warning had been issued at the end of this week that the public should not gather in that area when Japanese planes were rampant. Thirty American nationals in the Yangtze River basin arrived at Huangsha Station last night, and fortunately they had already left before the Japanese planes attacked, escaping disaster. After the third attack, Reuters reporters went to inspect the disaster area, but armed soldiers were stationed around the area, prohibiting passage. Therefore, only very active rescue teams were seen. In the midst of this chaos, the exact number of deaths and injuries could not be ascertained. The second attack involved as many as thirteen planes, which had never happened before. Six planes were discovered as early as 9:10 AM, and the anti-aircraft guns fired upwards in succession, their sound like thunder, heard throughout the city, but they did not seem to hit much. The two air raids lasted about an hour. Then, three Japanese planes were seen flying over Shameen at a height of a thousand feet at 10:25 AM, apparently flying back to their base. The railway workshop seemed to have been hit by bombs, and there was some oil stored there, so black smoke rose into the sky, and it is feared that many workers were killed. Many machine gun shells were collected in Shameen today. The alarm came again at 1:30 PM. Five Japanese planes flew over the northwest of Guangzhou, making a third attack along the Yuehan Railway today. The alarm was lifted at 4:30 PM. Foreigners and foreign warships in Shameen were safe. According to semi-official news, the result of this morning's attack on Huangsha Station was a total of eighty deaths and injuries, most of the dead being residents of the vicinity, with only six killed at the station.

<h3>Zhang Fulian Forcibly Inspected by Japanese Police</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Diplomatic circles report that Mr. Zhang Lian, former counselor of our country's special mission to the coronation of the British king, recently returned to China from Europe via Japan. He held a diplomatic passport, and on the 18th, he boarded the Japanese Empress liner via Yokohama, but did not disembark. He was forcibly inspected by Japanese police officers. Our consulate general in Yokohama protested to the Kanagawa Prefectural Office, but the chief of the foreign affairs section replied that during this time of war, Chinese people, whether ordinary people or diplomats, can be inspected for their belongings, bodies, and homes if necessary. He also said that this was done under orders, and that even Chinese envoys and consuls are not guaranteed. China is free to take retaliatory action. Currently, our ambassador to Japan, Xu, has lodged a serious protest with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but there has been no result. The diplomatic relations between the Chinese and Japanese governments have not been severed, and this unreasonable behavior of the Japanese is a clear violation of international conventions. Furthermore, the remarks of the chief of the foreign affairs section are especially absurd and barbaric. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Government Expresses Approval to Convene Pacific Conference</h3>
<p>To Be Held in London Next Month - League of Nations Advisory Committee Met Yesterday</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Advisory Committee will meet today to discuss China's complaint regarding the Sino-Japanese conflict. It is expected that Australian representative Bruce will propose a resolution advocating for a conference of countries related to the Pacific to discuss the current urgent issues. However, whether this motion can be passed depends on the attitude of the United States. (Reuters dispatch, 27th, from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the Australian Federal Representative Bruce's proposal to convene a conference of Pacific nations, it has been recently heard that the United States government has informally expressed its willingness to participate in discussions on the Sino-Japanese issue. Therefore, this conference may be held in London next month. (Havas dispatch, 27th, from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the Australian Federal Representative Bruce's proposal to convene a Pacific conference to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue, a certain American observer at the League of Nations believes that this matter is unlikely to be successful, because the countries concerned are consulting each other through diplomatic channels. Many say that this conference is unlikely to be convened under the current circumstances. Regarding this matter, the Chinese delegation is trying to make it clear that if this conference cannot be convened, the responsibility does not lie with their country. The country's chief representative, Dr. Gu Weijun, recently declared that China supports major countries consulting each other, in accordance with whatever procedures, in order to determine a common attitude. However, China's complaint submitted to the League of Nations cannot be ignored. China cannot allow it to be so, and should use all possible methods to obtain satisfaction. In addition, regarding the conflict between China and Japan, and the Japanese army's methods of warfare, China should still submit a note to the League of Nations. This note will be submitted for discussion by Ambassador Gu Weijun when the League of Nations General Assembly's Sino-Japanese issue advisory committee meets today. Although the major countries all hope to quickly determine a possible unified attitude, this is only possible with the cooperation of the United States government. According to recent news from Washington, the United States government is still adopting a wait-and-see attitude at present. If so, the advisory committee, in order to expedite its work, may invite countries directly related to the Pacific issue to form a smaller committee to carry out discussions separately. Regarding this level, people at the League of Nations generally believe that the United States may change its current attitude in the near future. (Havas dispatch, 27th, from Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Appeals to the United States</h3>
<p>Do Not Adopt a Policy of Isolation, Encouraging the Arrogance of Aggressor Nations</p>
<p>[Geneva] Dr. Gu Weijun, Chinese Ambassador to France and Chief Representative to the League of Nations, delivered a 20-minute radio address to the United States at the League of Nations tonight. Dr. Gu first outlined the situation of Japan's aggression against China over the past eleven weeks, stating that Japan fabricated suitable excuses to initiate incidents and launched a large-scale war against China to realize its so-called sacred mission of conquering the world. International law, treaty obligations, and humanitarianism are all disregarded by Japan. Soon, no major power, regardless of its geographical isolation or its removal from the turmoil, will be able to enjoy peace and prosperity. The current situation in the Far East is like a fire burning in a neighbor's house. China has special reasons to request sympathy and assistance from the United States. The American democratic spirit has deeply encouraged the leaders of the Chinese Republic. Japan's violation of the Nine-Power Treaty is not only against China but also against the United States and other signatory nations. The United States' traditional policy towards China has always been one of friendly assistance, an impression deeply rooted in the hearts of the Chinese people. The ability of the Chinese army to resist and achieve final victory depends on a continuous supply of energy from abroad. Any obstacles or difficulties preventing the purchase and transport of military arms and ammunition to the United States and other countries will not only harm China but also benefit Japan, which possesses a large navy and huge ships. Japan is like a restless, predatory tiger, long attempting to seize the flesh and blood of China, thereby threatening other countries in the Pacific. Although the tiger has not yet achieved its desires, once unleashed and allowed to act as it pleases, it will be difficult to restrain its actions. China does not currently want the United States to join the war or be drawn into the vortex of this conflict. China possesses brave troops determined to resist, but it needs moral and material support. I sincerely hope that your country will not abandon China, your loyal friend, in times of hardship, but under the leadership of your President, will provide sincere assistance to our country.

<h3>Major Powers Should Take Joint Action to Stop the Brutal Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>Dr. Wang Jingchun Publishes an Article in England; Hu Shi Believes China Will Be Able to Sustain the War of Resistance</p>
<p>[London] Dr. Wang Jingchun, Chairman of the London China Association and Director of the Chinese Purchasing Commission, recently published an open letter in The Times, stating, "It is good that the British public can express sympathy for the misfortunes China has encountered. However, unless the countries take joint and effective action to stop the destructive work carried out by the Japanese army in China, they will ultimately suffer the fate of fish in a drained pond. Former U.S. President Lincoln said, 'If we cannot unite and succeed, we will inevitably fail together.' Those who consider glorious isolation advantageous will be repaid with glorious isolation by other countries... It is not too late for the countries concerned to take joint and effective action."

<h3>The United States' Attitude is Firm, and the Soviet Union is Quite Satisfied</h3>
<p>[Moscow] Since the U.S. government decided to fully protect its nationals residing in China (referring to the statement made by Vice Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, on the 24th of this month), the Soviet Union has been extremely satisfied. It also believes that the U.S. government's two protests against Japan's large-scale bombing of Nanjing indicate that the country's attitude towards Japan is becoming increasingly firm. In addition, the Soviet Union is optimistic about the development of the war situation within China, believing that the Japanese army will soon encounter significant difficulties. As a result of the Chinese army's heroic resistance, a large number of Japanese troops will inevitably be held back, leaving them with no time to spare for other matters. Consequently, the Soviet Union's military position in the Far East will also be greatly improved. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 27th)</p>

<p>[Moscow] The Soviet Foreign Ministry officially announced today that Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Slavsky, lodged a "strong protest" in Tokyo yesterday against Japan's request for the Soviet Embassy in China to withdraw from Nanjing. The dispatch reiterated the Soviet Embassy's determination to remain in the Chinese capital and warned the Japanese government that "Japan should bear full responsibility for any consequences of such illegal acts." Furthermore, the Japanese side claimed that reports from Shanghai stated that Chinese planes were preparing to disguise themselves as Japanese planes to bomb the Soviet Embassy in order to provoke a dispute between Japan and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Embassy has warned the Japanese side to bear all responsibility for any bombing as a countermeasure against the Japanese fabrication of rumors. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Chinese Ambassador Jiang Tingfu delivered a note to the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on the 25th of this month, stating, "Japan is engaged in total war, even to the point of violating humanitarianism and international law, and is using airplanes to bomb Chinese civilians, the Red Cross, and cultural institutions." In addition to destroying civilian areas, it is also requesting that all ambassadors and ministers withdraw from Nanjing, hoping to completely destroy the Chinese capital. "If all of humanity turns a blind eye to these barbaric actions in the Far East and does not protest, similar incidents may occur anytime and anywhere in the future." The Soviet government should take appropriate measures to promptly cooperate with other countries to prevent such actions. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 27th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Step Up the Fundraising for National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>It has been a month since the fundraising for the national salvation bonds began. It is said that the subscribed amount is only 150 million yuan. According to the initial plan, these 500 million yuan of national salvation bonds were to be subscribed for 250 million yuan by overseas Chinese and 250 million yuan by domestic people. If the portion of the plan borne by overseas Chinese could be fully raised as planned, then the 500 million yuan of national salvation bonds would now be almost only 100 million yuan short, and it would be a great success. However, will the reality be that easy? I'm afraid it's not necessarily so. We know that there is still no news about the portion expected to be borne by overseas Chinese. As for the 150 million yuan that domestic people have subscribed to, most of it is the subscription amount from government-sponsored shops and groups. The number of subscriptions that are genuinely made voluntarily by the people can be said to be very small. And even the subscriptions from these government-sponsored shops and the like may not be paid in full at once. Because of these various relationships, according to recent reports, only 6 million yuan has been received one month after the issuance of national salvation bonds.</p>
<p>It cannot be said that the difficulty in raising these national salvation bonds is because the Chinese people are not patriotic. It cannot be said that it is because the Chinese people do not have the habit of voluntarily subscribing to public bonds. China has issued public bonds for decades, and has almost never asked the people to subscribe voluntarily. Now, in one day, we want the people to do something that they are not used to, and we still expect it to have very good results. This is of course very difficult. Therefore, we do not need to express pessimism about the inability to quickly raise national salvation bonds. Here, in addition to continuing to work hard to publicize and solicit donations, we feel that it seems necessary to make some changes to the way national salvation bonds are issued.</p>
<p>Obviously, the war of resistance requires money, and it requires money immediately. The current slow free public bonds will definitely not be able to undertake this mission. In other words, if we completely abandon the method of compulsory public bonds in our current issuance of national salvation bonds, it will not be easy to achieve the goal of quickly obtaining money. Therefore, we feel that it is necessary to adopt both free and compulsory methods for the issuance of national salvation bonds. At the same time, it is also a way to improve the current situation where national salvation bonds are slow to be raised.</p>
<p>The compulsory subscription of national salvation bonds is not only limited to individuals, but also to groups. (1) On the individual side, the compulsory standard is a certain fraction of property. Local governments across the country can be ordered to enforce the standard and force wealthy people to subscribe to national salvation bonds. This method will not be surprising to the Chinese people who are accustomed to heavy taxes and levies, nor will they oppose it much. However, there is one very important point here, and that is that the large properties of dignitaries and wealthy families should not be allowed to escape this compulsion. Otherwise, this will be the government against the lower-ranking people. (2) On the group side, with the exception of charitable groups, compulsory subscriptions can be made based on the amount of capital or funds. Here, we should especially pay attention to the banks that have underwritten public bonds in the past. We know that in the past, underwriting public bonds by banks not only received interest, but also had huge issuance discounts that cannot be explained in words. Therefore, banks have received a lot of benefits from the government in the past. Now, at this time of national crisis, it can be said that it is the way of heaven and earth for the government to force banks to underwrite national salvation bonds. If the fundraising for national salvation bonds can proceed in this way from both free and compulsory aspects, not to mention 500 million yuan, even 1 billion yuan would not be a problem.</p>
<h3>The German Head of State Accompanies the Italian Prime Minister to Observe Military Exercises in Mecklenburg</h3>
<p>And Visit the Krupp Armaments Factory; Yesterday Afternoon They Went to Berlin by Car</p>
<p>[Berlin] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini came to return the visit and arrived in Munich yesterday. He was accompanied by Head of State Hitler to Mecklenburg Province to observe German naval, land, and air force exercises. This morning, the two, together with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, German Foreign Minister Neurath, Ambassador to England Ribbentrop, and others, arrived in Lalendorf, Mecklenburg Province (40 kilometers from Rostock). They were welcomed at the station by German Defense Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Exercises General von Blomberg, Minister of Aviation General Göring, Commander-in-Chief of the Army General Fritsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Admiral Raeder, Italian Chief of Staff General Badoglio, and others. After Mussolini and Hitler got out of the car, they went to observe the exercises. The area was covered with mountains, forests, and many lakes, making for excellent scenery. The group first went to the rear positions of the "Blue Army" (responsible for defense), stood on a small hill, and observed the combined attack movements of artillery, air force, and tank units. Major General Udet was seen personally flying a small reconnaissance plane, actively scouting the movements of the enemy, the "Red Army" (responsible for attack). Then, they went to the "Red Army" encampment to observe the counter-attack situation. Finally, they went to the highlands of Huxburg to observe the final battle between the two sides. The participating troops totaled three armies. "The Blue Army" used hundreds of bombers to cover tank units and machine gun units, launching a fierce attack, followed by infantry. As a result of the battle between the two sides, the "Blue Army" finally broke through the enemy's front line and repelled them. Italian Prime Minister and Head of State Hitler greatly admired the hard work of the units participating in the exercise for a week. After observing the exercises, they went together to the western industrial area of Germany, and it is estimated that they will arrive at the city of Essen at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow in order to visit the famous armaments factory, the Krupp factory. Before leaving, they also received the British and Hungarian observation groups. The British observation group was led by the Chief of Staff of that country, General Deverell, and the Hungarian observation group was led by the Chief of Staff of that country, General Réd. After the Italian Prime Minister and Head of State Hitler and his party set off, they were warmly welcomed by the people everywhere they went, especially in the city of Rostock.

<p>⊙ Essen: Mussolini arrived at this station at 8:00 a.m. this morning. After getting out of the car, he and Hitler reviewed the guard of honor composed of stormtroopers. Then, they got into a car and drove straight to the Krupp Armaments Factory, where they were warmly received by the factory director Krupp and all the staff. Among those who came to the factory to visit with Hitler and Mussolini were Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, Minister of Propaganda Alfieri, German Deputy Leader of the Nazi Party Hess, Minister of Propaganda Goebbels, Minister of Justice Frank, and many others.

<p>⊙ Essen: Head of State Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini of Italy visited the Krupp Armaments Factory here today and have now returned to Berlin by special train this afternoon. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>⊙ Essen: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini visited the Krupp Armaments Factory yesterday, where he thoroughly inspected a steam hammer forging machine weighing 1,500 tons and an engraving machine. (Germany's engraving manufacturing technology was competitive with the UK's as early as 1914). Next, they visited the locomotive manufacturing plant. Finally, they spent a long time at the cannon foundry and the naval artillery assembly plant. They saw workers making more than a hundred cannons, military climbing vehicles, and many military artillery machines. After the visit, Italy praised the excellent manufacturing technology of Germany. As Germany is a military and technological ally of Italy, its military manufacturing achievements are so excellent that it is appropriate for the Italian Prime Minister to praise it highly.

<h3>Hitler-Mussolini Talks Harmonious</h3>
<p>Italy Joins the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact; Germany Hints That It Does Not Particularly Welcome It</p>
<p>[London] According to the Berlin correspondent of the London Times, the German government has hinted to Mussolini that the German government does not particularly welcome Mussolini's formal announcement of joining the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact at this time. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] It was declared today that the political results of Mussolini's visit to Germany will be published in a communiqué before Mussolini departs to return home on Wednesday. However, according to well-informed officials, both politicians consider the harmony of their talks to be more important than any specific plan advocated by other politicians. The communiqué may be empty or give new mysteries in some way. Both politicians said that the creators of politics are people, not plans. It is heard that the basis of all conversations between the two politicians included various political issues, such as opposition to Bolshevism, and recognizing the Franco government based on non-interference and Spanish land integrity. As for the Mediterranean issue, Germany, apart from Italy gaining equal status with other countries, is not concerned. Mussolini's visit to Germany will reach its peak on Tuesday evening, when 500,000 people will gather at the Olympic Stadium for a great demonstration. The speeches delivered by the two dictators will be broadcast by German and Italian radio stations. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 27th)</p>

<h3>The Brutal Behavior of the Enemy Army Arouses the Indignation of Various Countries</h3>
<p>British and American People Launch a Boycott of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>[Washington] Various U.S. states have now begun to boycott Japanese goods and launch a movement to ban the import of Japanese goods. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[London] British newspapers are now filled with news of the vigorous anger of the British public regarding the indiscriminate bombing of Chinese cities by Japanese planes. Yesterday was Sunday, and the lectures in various churches also unanimously condemned Japan's brutality. The National Peace Council of the United Kingdom has now submitted a written protest to the Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Yoshida, expressing "extreme terror and horror" regarding the Japanese bombing. Many famous figures in the intellectual community, such as the Archbishop of Birmingham, are at the forefront. Demands to exclude Japanese goods are already beginning to appear in religious circles. Former Undersecretary of State Sir Acland also wrote to The Times, stating, "The bombing of Guangzhou must be stopped, and stopping it is not impossible. More than three-quarters of Japan's foreign trade is carried out with countries where the flags of the UK, the U.S., and the Netherlands are raised, and the leaders of these three countries are all highly civilized and advocate humanitarianism and compassion. They should unite and immediately suspend trade with Japan within a week. If so, the slaughter can be stopped. Are they unwilling to do so?" The Bishop of Bristol also wrote to The Times, making the same appeal. He said, "I am speaking loudly for what is being neglected by many Englishmen. News articles report a message that private organizations have already been formed to exclude Japanese goods and list the major imports of Japanese goods for identification, and to check that the online value of these imported goods in 1935 was 8.75 million pounds. The newspaper repeatedly urges readers to check the country of origin when purchasing goods. Furthermore, a large London chain of soft drink stores recently wrote to the Manchester Guardian, stating, "I am buying 100 million straws today. The price is extremely cheap, but I suddenly thought of the barbaric bombing of Guangzhou, China, and immediately tore up the contract." The Manchester Guardian cited the rules of the 1923 Hague air warfare in its thesis, indicating that it contradicts what the Japanese naval attaché in Shanghai claimed, because the Hague rules clearly prohibit the bombing of military locations where non-combatants are mixed. The newspaper also stated that six major countries in the world have separately protested to Japan against the indiscriminate bombing of non-combatants in various parts of China, "The time has come for them to unite with other countries and lodge a more solemn, formal, and severe protest against this unforgivable slaughter."

<h3>Dutch East Indies Ports Cancel Japanese Goods Orders</h3>
<p>Canceling Orders for 70 Million Yen; Factories in Osaka and Yokohama Have Stopped Production</p>
<p>The Dutch and British territories in the South Seas Islands have a wide sales market for Japanese goods. The annual number of Japanese goods imported ranks first in the South Seas' population cargo. Therefore, in addition to China, the South Seas is the second largest market for Japan's foreign trade. Since the Shanghai War followed the outbreak in North China, various atrocities have aroused world indignation. The economic sanctions against Japan have spread throughout the South Seas. In the past month or so, the sales of Japanese goods have plummeted. The Dutch East Indies ports have recently canceled orders for Japanese goods, and the number has reached as high as 70 million yen. The loss of Japanese goods in the South Seas market is evident. Therefore, since the beginning of this month, more than 40 factories belonging to the textile, hardware, and toy departments of Mitsubishi Corporation, the Japanese foreign trade organization, have all announced the suspension of work. At the same time, 300 to 400 large and small factories in Osaka and Yokohama have announced the suspension of work. The number of unemployed men and women workers is no less than 100,000. Therefore, after our country carries out a protracted war of resistance, the enemy's economic organization will inevitably collapse.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Assembly Discusses the Spanish Question</h3>
<p>Spanish Government Representative Makes Five Demands, Vigorously Condemning Italian and German Interference in the Civil War</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Assembly convened this morning to discuss the Spanish issue, listening to the speech of Mr.  伐育, the representative of the Spanish Republican government. Mr. 伐育 first stated that the Spanish government put forward the following five demands: ㊀ that the League of Nations Assembly recognize the aggression of Italy and Germany against Spain; ㊁ that the League of Nations discuss how to eliminate this act of aggression; ㊂ that the Spanish government be permitted to purchase military supplies from abroad; ㊃ that foreign volunteers fighting in Spain be withdrawn; ㊄ that all measures decided by the Nyon Mediterranean Conference to prohibit piracy should apply equally to Spanish ships. Mr. 伐育 then proceeded to list various facts to prove the interference of Germany and Italy in the Spanish civil war, stating that Italy is now intensifying its efforts, preparing to transport a large amount of military supplies and troops to Spain to aid the rebel forces. What a dictatorial country is inflicting on Spain today may be inflicted on other countries tomorrow. He also lodged a strong protest against the policy of non-interference in the Spanish conflict, specifically pointing out to Britain and France, saying: The non-interference agreement continues to be violated, and the entry of foreign troops into Spain has not been prevented. Do Britain and France still believe that the non-interference agreement still exists? Finally, he requested that the League of Nations Assembly adopt the various demands put forward by the Spanish government. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 27th)</p>

<h3>Simple Method for Making and Using Anti-Gas Masks</h3>
<p>Published by the Municipal Party Department</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department of this city recently examined the statistics of soldiers' deaths in the European War, and found that the number of deaths caused by ordinary weapons was dozens of times higher than the number of deaths caused by poisoning. It is known that if soldiers have adequate defenses, poison gas is not enough to cause harm. However, our compatriots lack knowledge of medical treatment for poisonous gas in war. Yesterday, we specially published the following simple method for making and using anti-gas masks: ㊀ Gauze: Take forty layers of medical sterile gauze and cut them into small pieces of twelve centimeters square for soaking in chemicals. Separately, take a strip of gauze fifteen centimeters wide and one and a half meters long for tying the mask. ㊁ Chemicals: The most practical prescriptions obtained through testing are of two kinds: A. Soak Urotropin 19 parts, sodium carbonate (powdered Na2CO3) 7 parts (if it is crystalline, NaCO3.10H2O should be 20 parts), sodium thiosulfate (crystalline, commonly known as hypo Na2S2O35H2O) 22 parts (if it is powdered, Na2S2O3 should be 14 parts), water 47 parts, and alcohol 5 parts to form a solution. B. Soak Urotropin 20 parts, sodium carbonate (powdered Na2CO3) 10 parts (if it is crystalline, NaCO3.1OH2O should be 29 parts), water 60 parts to form a solution. ㊂ Soaking: Immerse forty layers of gauze, twelve centimeters square, into the above chemicals A or B, taking either one. After it is completely wet, take it out and squeeze it until it is half-dry. (The amount of chemicals prescribed above is sufficient to prepare one mask, so a large amount of chemical liquid should not be squeezed out. If you want to make multiple masks, then the amount of chemicals should be increased according to the above prescription). ㊃ Tying: Cover the mouth and nose with gauze soaked in chemicals, and tie the gauze around it, with moderate tightness, ensuring that it is completely tight so that the inhaled air must pass through the mask. ㊄ Effectiveness: The anti-toxic time of a mask soaked in chemical A (calculated with a phosgene concentration of one-thousandth) is 15 minutes. The concentration of poison gas on the battlefield is lower, and it can support more than one hour. If soaked in chemical B, the anti-toxic time of the mask (calculated with a phosgene concentration of one-thousandth) is 20 minutes. The concentration on the battlefield is lower, and it can support more than one hour. If a layer of sparse sterile cotton about 1 cm thick is sandwiched between the forty layers of gauze, the smoke-filtering effect of the mask can be increased. Even if cotton with a thickness of 2 cm is sandwiched in, it will not feel difficult to breathe. ㊅ Removal: If you notice that poison gas has penetrated after the mask has been used for a long time, it must be replaced. If there is no poison gas present, it should be removed, washed with water, and re-soaked in chemicals, and it can still be reused. If the enemy releases tear gas, goggles can be worn, and the air holes on the goggles can be sealed with tape in advance. The above method for making masks is simple and inexpensive. If compatriots from all walks of life can each make one for themselves, they can protect themselves from lung poisoning. As for protection against blistering agents and skin protection, it is best to wear anti-gas clothing. The parts of the body that cannot be covered by masks and anti-gas clothing should be coated with anti-gas ointment to avoid poison gas.</p>

<h3>514 Overseas Chinese from Japan Arrive in Shanghai on the Xinjiang Ship; Overseas Chinese from Guangdong and Fujian to Depart Today on the Original Ship; Overseas Chinese Talk About Their Suffering in Japan</h3>
<p>514 overseas Chinese from Japan gathered in Kobe on the 23rd and returned to China on the Xinjiang ship of the British Swire Shipping Company, arriving in Shanghai at 5:10 PM yesterday. The municipal government, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and the Ningbo, Guangdong, Fujian, and Wenzhou fellow-countrymen associations sent personnel to receive them. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Receive</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received telegrams from our country's Consul General in Yokohama, Japan, and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, informing them that 514 overseas Chinese from Japan were returning to China on the Xinjiang ship. They immediately ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to provide proper reception. The government sent staff members Tan Jiqing and others from the Social Affairs and Police Bureaus to the wharf to receive them. At the same time, the Shanghai Branch of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission sent Tan Zhonglu, and the Ningbo, Fujian, Guangdong, and Wenzhou fellow-countrymen associations also sent personnel, holding flags, to the Bund in the French Concession, Taikoo Wharf, to take care of everything. The French Concession Police Department specially dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to maintain order at the wharf.</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Last Night</p>
<p>The ship arrived at the wharf at 5:10 PM yesterday. Representatives from the Social Affairs and Police Bureaus and various fellow-countrymen associations boarded the ship to express their condolences and prepared a large number of refreshments to receive all the overseas Chinese disembarking the ship, using cars to take them to the Ningbo fellow-countrymen association on Yu Qiaqing Road, the Sanshan Guildhall on Fuzhou Road, and the Dongya, Xin Xin, and Datong hotels for accommodation. However, most of the overseas Chinese were from Ningbo, followed by those from Guangdong and Fujian, and they were eager to return to their hometowns, so they were unwilling to disembark the ship to avoid complications. Therefore, except for a few overseas Chinese who landed, the rest stayed on the ship.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Talk</p>
<p>Last night, the reporter boarded the ship to meet Mr. Zhang Jiayi, who has been living in Yokohama for more than ten years and engaged in the Western clothing industry. According to him, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, overseas Chinese in various parts of Japan, such as Yokohama, Kobe, and Tokyo, have been affected by the boycott of the Japanese people, making it impossible to maintain their businesses, especially the Western clothing, hairdressing, and restaurant industries. The overseas Chinese in Japan have a strong patriotic heart and all want to return to their motherland. Therefore, they requested the consulates of our country in various parts of Japan and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to find a way to send ships to transport them back to the country. We overseas Chinese gathered in Kobe on the 23rd and boarded the Xinjiang ship to return to the country. There were 204 people from Yokohama and 310 people from Kobe and Tokyo, a total of 514 people, mostly merchants. The reporter then inquired about the situation in Japan. According to him, all major cities in Japan are practicing air defense, because they are deeply afraid of Chinese planes bombing them. Reserve soldiers in various places have been ordered to come to China to invade, and a large number of them have already come to China.</p>
<p>According to an overseas Chinese, the Japanese authorities have used clever words to dissuade Chinese businessmen from returning to the country, saying that it is safer in Japan than in China, and that there is no need to return to the country to be frightened, etc. However, those who return to the country have all their property, which they have been managing in Japan for more than ten years, confiscated by the Japanese side, otherwise, they will not be allowed to leave Japan. According to him, although the shops in Tokyo and Osaka are brightly decorated on the surface, there are few customers and the market is unusually depressed. The two places will begin to conduct air defense exercises every day from the first of next month, with the aim of creating a war atmosphere throughout the country. Among the overseas Chinese, those who are registered in Ningbo and Fujian will take the New Beijing and the original ship to their hometowns today.</p>
<p>In addition, the Sichuan ship, which sailed from Hong Kong to Shanghai at 5:20 PM yesterday, also carried more than 50 overseas Chinese who returned from Yokohama, and docked at Taikoo Wharf. Most of them are students who studied in Japan. According to a student, the Japanese side hates our country's intellectuals. Before they left Japan, they were beaten. Several classmates suffered excessive torture, resulting in mental disorders and inability to speak.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Purchase of National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Actively Promoting Rent for Bond Purchases; Colleagues at Bank of Communications Subscribe for 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Deposits to Purchase</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Hanliang, a member of the United Council of Citizens in Special District 1 of this city, sent a letter to the General Labor Union of this city yesterday in response to the method of purchasing national salvation bonds with deposit deductions and taking the lead in implementing it, hoping that depositors will follow suit. The original text reads: Greetings, it is reported that your union's suggestion to purchase national salvation bonds by deduction is excellent and admirable. There are a large number of wealthy depositors in our country. If this method is implemented, it will not be difficult to raise the bond amount. It is best to ask the government to strictly order all banks and money shops in the country to truthfully report the depositors' funds and not to be partial or afraid of power. They must all comply with the regulations. Further, foreign banks' Chinese deposits should also be handled in the same way, and the results will be even more impressive. Your union's proposal has truly won my heart. I hereby express my support. Hanliang has been serving society for 30 years without engaging in production. Therefore, his accumulated savings over the years are only 1,500 yuan deposited in the Four Bank Savings Association. Now that it is about to expire, I am willing to propose 10% to purchase bonds in accordance with your union's proposal. Although the amount is small, it is a small effort to fulfill my duty and to promote it. I hope that it will be widely publicized and set an example. If it can inspire wealthy depositors to propose it automatically without government supervision, it will further demonstrate the spirit of our national unity in resisting the war. The final victory will belong to us. Since your union is doing it for the sake of awakening the people, Hanliang should respond to society, and reputation is not what I care about. Yours sincerely, Wang Hanliang.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Achievements</p>

<p>One Month's Rent</p>
<p>Since the United Council of Citizens in Special District 1 suggested to the General Assembly to purchase national salvation bonds with one month's rent and sent a letter to the Real Estate Industry Association to seek opinions, the Real Estate Industry Association has now resolved to notify real estate owners to purchase national salvation bonds with all the rent for September, which will be paid by the tenants on behalf of the landlords, and exchange the bank receipt for rent tickets. It is learned from relevant parties that although the principle of purchasing bonds with rent has been determined, how to promote it to the tenants is still under discussion. Some advocate setting up a special committee in addition to the commercial and citizen teams to handle the purchase of bonds with rent, while others advocate that the two special district city associations, which are usually closer to the tenants, should handle the matter. Which method to take will be determined within a few days so that fundraising can be promoted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Colleagues at Bank of Communications</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications has been very enthusiastic about the purchase of national salvation bonds.

It is understood that the team believes that this city is located at the financial hub of the country, and the women's movement has taken the lead in the national atmosphere, so they should work hard to set an example for the whole country. They have set a minimum limit of 1 million yuan and have hired 300 team leaders to actively carry out the work. It is heard that Madame Kong is also very interested and has decided to do her best to raise funds.</p>

<h3>War Spoils Seized by Our Army in Luodian</h3>
<h3>Shanghai Relief Association Ordered to Correct Its Name</h3>
<p>In Accordance with the Central Government's Outline; Re-Appoint Committee Members Separately</p>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Committee, since before the outbreak of the Shanghai War, was presided over by Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau and established in late July. Its internal organization and work situation have been reported separately to the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Interior's Relief Committee, and the Municipal Government for filing. Since the Central Government has stipulated the organizational outline of the sub-committees of the emergency refugee relief associations in various provinces and cities, the Shanghai Municipal Government ordered the association yesterday to follow the instructions and correct its name, and to separately add or appoint all the members, standing committee members, and supervisory committee members of the association. The list of committee members is as follows: ㊀ Standing committee members: Pan Gongzhan, Chen Zhiyi, Li Ting'an, Cai Jingjun, Xu Fu, Huang Boqiao, Wu Yu, Qian Xin'an, Zhang Jiafu, Zhou Zongliang, Guo Chengen, Qu Wenliu, Lu Bohong, Zhou Bangjun, Song Hanzhang, Pang Jingzhou, Hu Yunqiu; ㊁ Supervisory committee members: Lin Kanghou and 21 others; ㊂ Committee members: Mao Yun and 149 others. It is also heard that the association originally had 11 standing committee members, and 6 new members have been added this time: Chen Zhiyi, Li Ting'an, Cai Jingjun, Xu Fu, Huang Boqiao, and Wu Yu. How the association will be reorganized will be discussed and decided at the standing committee meeting to be held tomorrow.</p>
<h3>French Concession Issues New Police Order</h3>
<p>Thieves Resisting Arrest Will Be Shot; Police Ordered to Investigate Gambling, Opium Dens, and Prostitution</p>
<p>In view of the fact that since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, major cases of robbery, shooting, and murder have occurred on Fuxing Road in the concession, and the thieves have not been caught so far, the French police authorities are afraid that some lawless elements will collude to commit armed robbery again. Therefore, the Police Department ordered all subordinate police stations to thoroughly investigate the previous criminal gangs. From today onwards, they will also dispatch detectives to patrol in shifts, openly and secretly. If they encounter anyone behaving suspiciously, they should immediately interrogate them. If they are evasive or hesitant, they should be arrested immediately. If they encounter criminals resisting arrest with firearms, they are allowed to be shot dead to maintain the security of the concession. Furthermore, because some residents in the concession have taken advantage of the serious situation and the fact that the police have many tasks to secretly engage in gambling, set up opium dens, and run private prostitution houses, all of which are the root causes of thieves and bandits, it is heard that the police have specially ordered the gambling and vice squads to conduct strict investigations.</p>
<h3>Yangshupu and Hongkou Continued to Open Yesterday</h3>
<p>Foreigners Move Goods; Crowded</p>
<p>The enemy military authorities have once again opened the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, and many foreigners from the war zone have gone to retrieve the remaining items. Yesterday, it was still open for one day. Since around 7:00 AM, the Waibaidu Bridge was crowded with foreign men and women, mostly British and American nationals. At 8:00 AM, the bridge was opened, and they crossed the bridge one after another. About 40 to 50 trucks were used to transport goods out before noon, mostly frozen fish cheeks, flour, and various other foods.</p>
<h3>Using Discarded Cloth to Make Anti-Enemy Shoes</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Comfort Committee started the campaign to collect cotton vests, donations have been very enthusiastic. Now, in order to make use of the remaining scraps from making vests, we request ladies from all walks of life to sew anti-enemy shoes: ㊀ The sole should be layered with twelve layers and sewn firmly with bottom-stitching thread. The size should be from 7.3 to 7.5 inches. ㊁ The upper should be made of blue cloth, and the opening should not be too deep. For example, if the sole is 7.3 inches, the upper should be 8 inches. The shoe welt should be sewn firmly. ㊂ The upper should be in the style of running shoes, but use two straps about three or four inches long for tying.</p>
<h3>Chinese Employees of De Fu Foreign Firm Donate Gas Masks</h3>
<p>The Soldiers on the Songhu Front are Very Satisfied; Hoping That Chinese Employees of Foreign Firms Will Follow Suit</p>
<p>The Chinese employees of De Fu Foreign Firm in this city have donated several times since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, doing their best to fulfill their national duty. Now, in response to the urgent needs of the front, they have specially purchased a large number of the best gas masks and sent them to the soldiers on the front line for use. The authorities were very satisfied after receiving them and expressed their gratitude, hoping that Chinese employees of foreign firms across the country will follow suit, which will be a considerable help to the rear support work.</p>
<h3>Anti-Gas Masks Purchased and Donated to the Front by All Chinese Employees of De Fu Foreign Firm</h3>
<h3>Strict Investigation of the Asia Voice Radio Donation Case</h3>
<p>Many Receipt Stubs Have Been Obliterated; Radio Owner Summoned for Questioning</p>
<p>Asia Voice Radio Station in Juhler Road of this city, during the War of Resistance, colluded with a small number of amateur Peking opera singers to broadcast and sing Peking opera, raising a large sum of donations. Afterward, they did not fulfill their promise to send the funds to the Shanghai Local Association. When the association discovered this, it sent a letter to the Shanghai Propaganda Committee, requesting a strict investigation. According to a report from the Shen Shi News Agency reporter, as of yesterday, after inquiring with the Broadcasting Industry Association, the donations announced by the Shanghai Evening Post totaled 18,000 yuan, which can be verified. However, other unannounced donations are not included, so the total amount is still under investigation. The radio station owner, Mr. Wang, was summoned by the authorities for questioning yesterday. It is said that the inside story of this matter is quite complicated. The most important issue is that many receipt stubs have been obliterated, indicating a major fraudulent practice. Furthermore, the radio station owner's recent actions have been extraordinarily extravagant, spending money like water. In addition to buying a new car, he also rents a room in the International Hotel every day for pleasure. All of these factors raise suspicions that there may be other hidden circumstances or that outsiders are deliberately slandering him. Therefore, the authorities are currently conducting a careful investigation to uncover the truth. As for certain amateur singers who initiated the matter, they are also under investigation as they are suspected of involvement.</p>
<h3>French Consul General Agrees to School Resumption</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai battle, schools in the war zone have been seeking to relocate and resume classes. Most of the schools in the public concession north of the Suzhou River have successively reopened. In the French concession, the French Consul General had previously announced a postponement of school resumption. The Social Bureau also issued a temporary postponement order because the military hospitals and refugee shelters could not be relocated in a timely manner. However, Director Pan believed that long-term resistance warfare should not lead to prolonged educational stagnation. He specifically met with Mr. Gao Chiyi, the Director of the Education Department of the French Municipal Council, last Thursday to discuss the issue of resuming classes as soon as possible. They reached a very harmonious agreement and both hoped that all schools could resume classes on October 1st. They also hoped that the Chinese directors of the French concession would assist in the negotiations. Director Pan then reported to Mayor Yu, requesting him to inform the French Consul General to formally express this intention. Agreement has been received, so the schools in the French concession will likely reopen soon.</p>
<h3>International Relief Committee Plans to Establish Shelters in the Chinese Territory</h3>
<p>Currently Seeking Suitable Locations; Sanitary Facilities in Each Shelter Will Be Perfect</p>
<p>The International Relief Committee held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Committee members Mr. Westrop and Mr. Hollif of the British committee, Mr. Maurice of the American committee, Mr. Qu Wenliu, Mr. Song Hanzhang, Mr. Zhang Lanting, Mr. Guan Jiongzhi, Mr. Chen Ganchen, and Mr. Li Guiyong of the Chinese committee, as well as representatives of the Russian community, were present. Chairman Qu Wenliu began by having Mr. Maurice, the Director of the Relief Team, report that the sanitary facilities in each shelter were perfect. The representative of the International Red Cross, upon inspecting the shelters of the committee, also considered them to be well-managed and very satisfactory. Subsequently, the following resolutions were discussed and passed: ⑴ An allocation of 5,000 yuan each for the regular expenses of the first and second shelters. ⑵ To establish an additional shelter in the Chinese territory for refugees who cannot enter the concessions. After finding a suitable location in the Xujiahui area, the matter will be handled further. ⑶ Because the weather is getting colder and the refugees have no clothes to keep warm, to rush to make cotton-padded clothes and to raise funds from all sectors of society. ⑷ To invite influential figures from all sectors to join as members. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<h3>Sheng Sheng Hospital Temporarily Shelters Refugee Mothers</h3>
<p>Thirty Beds Temporarily Set Up; All Expenses Waived</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai battle, hundreds of thousands of refugees have been displaced, and tens of thousands of people from nearby areas have temporarily sought refuge in the concessions. Among them, pregnant women about to give birth are in particular difficulty. Collapsing on the streets and giving birth there has happened. Recently, such a situation occurred in front of the Pudong Building. Mr. Qu Shaoheng, the director of Sheng Sheng Hospital on Rue Massenet, was initially specially contracted by the Red Cross to temporarily accept wounded soldiers. Now that the wounded soldiers have other arrangements, Mr. Qu, an expert in obstetrics, sympathizes with the difficulties of pregnant women. He obtained the support of enthusiastic friends and raised funds. He allocated a portion of the hospital building to temporarily shelter refugee mothers, with 30 beds available. All mothers from official refugee shelters designated by the relief organization can be referred to the hospital. All expenses will be waived. However, they can only be admitted when they are about to give birth, and the period of stay is limited to ten days. According to normal childbirth, ten days is sufficient to recover. If other illnesses are contracted due to childbirth and require treatment, continued hospitalization will be provided free of charge. A refugee mother sent by the Pudong Association a few days ago required surgery due to exhaustion, but she is now safe and sound. This is also good news amidst the war.</p>
<h3>Zou Yaodong Enthusiastically Promotes International Propaganda</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the International Propaganda Committee of the Shanghai Cultural Circles Salvation Association has made rapid progress in its work. For example, contacting foreigners, printing appeals to international friends, and distributing various pamphlets have all gained the sympathy of international figures. In addition, it sends press releases to various foreign newspapers in Shanghai once a day and sends communication drafts to overseas Chinese newspapers once a week, reporting on the domestic situation of resistance and national salvation. The results are considerable. However, the association's funds are extremely tight, and all current expenses and required items rely entirely on donations from all sectors of society. Yesterday, Mr. Zou Yaodong, the manager of Yaohua Soap Company, generously donated 100 French francs. Mr. Zou's enthusiasm for international propaganda is deeply appreciated. The association now eagerly hopes for material and spiritual support from all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>Guangbing Birthday Celebration</h3>
<p>Turning a Birthday Celebration into a National Blessing; Deeply Hoping That All Sectors Will Follow Suit</p>
<p>Educator Yang Weiyu is currently busy day and night in the Shanghai Local Association managing Guangbing (a type of baked bread), cotton vests, and comfort items. Today marks Mr. Yang's 50th birthday. The colleagues of the association, understanding Mr. Yang's intentions, did not hold extravagant celebrations. Instead, they purchased tens of thousands of Guangbing and forwarded them to the front lines. Celebrating Mr. Yang's birthday has been turned into a blessing for the country, which is truly a win-win situation. In the future, for celebratory occasions, it is deeply hoped that all sectors will follow this example.</p>

<h3>Liu Hang Warfare Gradually Subsiding; Our Army Defends the Yong'an Bridge Position</h3>
<p>Small Groups of Enemy Troops Harassing in the Luodian Area; Artillery Battles Between Both Sides in Jiangwan and Zhabei Continued Throughout the Night</p>
<p>From last night until this morning, there was no contact between large units of infantry on the entire line. However, the artillery battles between the two sides were extremely fierce, and enemy aircraft were also very active, dropping bombs aimlessly. However, our army's positions and other military works suffered no losses. The fighting in the Yong'an Bridge area also gradually subsided last night. Our army is firmly defending the Yong'an Bridge position. Having suffered this setback, the enemy seems unable to counterattack in the short term. As for the situation in the Luodian area in recent days, there have only been skirmishes between small units of both sides. We are firmly defending the dangerous terrain, and the enemy has no way to break through our defense line. The artillery battles in the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas did not stop throughout the night. The enemy infantry, fearing death, never dared to move out. Our front line remains unchanged and maintains its advantage. This morning at dawn, enemy ships in the Huangpu River again shelled our Pudong positions. We also returned fire, and the shelling stopped after a while. The enemy's fourth reinforcements have mostly arrived in recent days. According to those who came to Shanghai via Wusong by boat, the coastline from Wusong to Yangshupu is covered with newly arrived Japanese troops, and thousands of warhorses are in groups. Transportation is busy, and it seems that active preparations and reorganization are underway. A full-line offensive may still be pending.</p>
<p>This morning, a certain staff officer came to Shanghai from Luodian and spoke with the reporter about the frontline combat situation. Here are some excerpts: ⑴ The enemy troops are trapped in a corner and have made no progress to date. Yesterday's general offensive on the entire line also suffered a disastrous defeat. Since there is no progress in Luodian and repeated failures in Liuhang, the enemy is now adopting a feint attack strategy. Therefore, the situation in the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas is slightly tense. ⑵ On the Luodian line, we have built new, strong fortifications. The enemy will definitely not be able to break through by chance. Even heavy weapons are difficult to use. In recent days, the tide has been low, and the shallow beach is far from the shore, reducing the opportunities for enemy ships to operate. The area along the river is slightly calmer. ⑶ Several enemy aircraft flew over Luodian yesterday afternoon but did not drop bombs. It was later learned that they flew to Jiading Ximen to wreak havoc. The Jiafeng Yarn Factory and nearby civilian houses suffered considerable losses. ⑷ This morning, there was a fierce battle in the Changqiao Caowangmiao area north of Luodian for half a day. The artillery fire was very intense. Our army launched an assault from the trenches, and the bloody battle lasted for more than half an hour. The enemy retreated a li or so, leaving behind forty or fifty bodies and capturing more than forty new rifles. Our side suffered little loss. The afternoon was peaceful.</p>
<h3>Our Army Firmly Defends the Yong'an Bridge Line</h3>
<p>Enemy's Fierce Counterattack Suffers Setback</p>
<p>After our army recovered Yong'an Bridge on the Liuhang line, it advanced victoriously, and the defeated enemy troops were in a panic. After our army recovered all important villages, it quickly repaired the fortifications left by the enemy. At dawn yesterday morning, the defeated enemy returned to attack our positions in the Yong'an Bridge area, launching a fierce counterattack. In addition to artillery fire, enemy aircraft and tanks were also active. Our army took advantage of the remaining power of the new victory to bravely meet the enemy, fiercely attacking the enemy troops. Our artillery units also returned fire on the enemy. The fierce battle lasted from morning to night. By nightfall, the enemy's momentum gradually weakened, and they retreated. The fierce battle subsided slightly. At midnight, another enemy force attempted to attack. Our army was already prepared, and the enemy was driven back this morning. Our army is now firmly defending the Yong'an Bridge area, which is extremely solid. The enemy will definitely not dare to attack again.</p>
<h3>Small Groups of Enemy Troops Harass Luodian</h3>
<p>Ninety Percent Sacrificed Under Our Army's Machine Gun Fire</p>
<p>In the Luodian area, in addition to intermittently shelling our army's positions in the Xiangongmiao area, the enemy also sent small groups of more than 100 or 50 people in several small teams to harass our army's positions. Our army immediately surrounded and fiercely attacked them. Ninety percent were sacrificed under the machine gun fire of our army. Enemy corpses were scattered everywhere. The enemy's battle plans, important documents, and battle maps were seized, indicating that the enemy troops in Luodian were at the end of their rope and their plans were failing daily.</p>
<h3>Our Army Fiercely Attacks Enemy Troops on Jiangwan Road</h3>
<p>Many Enemies Killed; Enemy Forces Could Not Hold and Fled</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Starting last night (the 27th), the enemy in Jiangwan attacked our Chizhi University positions in three routes. Our army responded calmly, and the fierce battle lasted all night. At 0:30 this morning, the enemy's formation was broken up, and they could not hold and retreated. Our army immediately sent a machine gun team from Xinshi Road to pursue and attack the eastern end of the enemy's positions at the Patriotic Girls' School on Jiangwan Road, firing intensely. Many enemies were killed. The enemy forces could not hold and retreated. Our army did not advance deeply. By 3:00 this morning, the gunfire gradually subsided, with only small contact between the outposts.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Shell Pudong Positions</h3>
<p>No Target; Our Side Not Damaged</p>
<p>This morning at dawn, enemy ships in the Huangpu River frequently shelled our Pudong positions, aimlessly and wantonly.</p>
<p>On the Jiangwan lines, yesterday and this morning, our and enemy forces only exchanged artillery fire, with no other changes.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Bomb Pudong Again</h3>
<p>Flew Over Caohejing and Opened Fire to Strafe Refugees; Then Went to Longhua to Drop Bombs, All Falling in the Fields</p>
<p>Six enemy aircraft flew to Lujiazui, Lan Ni Du, and Qichang Dock in Pudong at 6:00 this morning and bombed them extensively. The sound was so loud that even the Xingyu area on the Puxi side was shaken. More than ten bombs were dropped one after another. Our army suffered no losses, and few civilian houses were destroyed. Only the earthen mounds of the graves were regarded as defensive works, and many of them were bombed into deep pools. Only a few civilians were injured. The enemy aircraft then flew low over the South Huangpu area and strafed, dropping many large stones. Around 10:00, they bombed again, causing considerable damage to civilian houses. Three aircraft also flew to the Nanshi area for reconnaissance but did not drop bombs.</p>
<p>It was also reported that at around 5:00 this morning, two teams of six enemy aircraft flew along the river from the Dong Yangshupu area to the sky above Pudong Nanshi, circling for a long time for reconnaissance. At around 8:00, one of the enemy aircraft flew over Pudong, and the remaining five aircraft flew to Caohejing. At that time, a long-distance bus carrying refugees was passing through the Shanghai-Minhang South Zhejiang Road. The five enemy aircraft noticed it and immediately flew low to pursue it but did not drop bombs. Instead, they fired machine guns. They chased it for a mile before stopping and turning back. The refugees on the bus were terrified. Unexpectedly, the enemy aircraft then flew to the Longhua Airport and carried out indiscriminate bombing, dropping a total of five bombs. The deafening sound was heard as they all exploded in the nearby fields, creating holes ten feet deep in the ground. No residents or city houses were injured, so there were no losses. The enemy aircraft then flew back to the east.</p>
<h3>Enemy Continues to Arrive with Large Quantities of Military Supplies</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, in addition to four transport ships carrying a portion of the enemy reinforcements, 5,000 men, three other transport ships, No. 132 Kifuku Maru, the Third Kouren Maru, and the Shanghai Maru, arrived at the same time and docked at the Osaka Shosen Kaisha North Pier and the Third Huangpu Pier. More than 200 warhorses, more than 50 six-wheeled armored vehicles, and more than 1,000 boxes of military equipment and ammunition were unloaded ashore. At around 4:00 PM, the Kifuku Maru and the Shanghai Maru sailed out one after another, and the Kouren Maru remained docked at the Osaka Shosen Kaisha North Pier. The Chikugo Maru, which arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, is still docked at the Wayson Wharf because the military supplies it was carrying have not yet been completely unloaded.</p>
<p>The enemy's merchant transport ship, converted into a Red Cross ship, Asahi Maru, arrived in Shanghai again at 7:30 the day before yesterday and docked at the Osaka Shosen Kaisha North Pier. After unloading a large number of medical supplies, it loaded about 800 wounded enemy soldiers and set sail for home at 11:00 AM yesterday. From this, the frequent comings and goings of the enemy's Red Cross ships show the heavy casualties of the enemy troops.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships in the Huangpu River are Heavily Guarded</h3>
<p>Fearing Our Bombardment, Sandbags Added to Ships</p>
<p>Several enemy ships berthed in the Huangpu River have been hit by artillery fire from our Pudong artillery positions. Because a large number of military equipment, ammunition, and other military supplies have arrived in recent days, the enemy has begun adding sandbags to the main warships, increasing the deployment of anti-aircraft guns and machine guns. The enemy flagship Izumo, which was heavily damaged by our attack and is berthed at No. 2 buoy, has not only piled sandbags about ten feet high on the deck but also built a circular sandpile at the bow and stern, each with three anti-aircraft guns mounted on top. There are as many as a dozen machine guns deployed on both sides of the ship. In addition, more than a dozen motorboats are moored around the ship, each equipped with two machine guns, constantly patrolling around the ship to protect it. The enemy's cautiousness and heavy guard show the accuracy of the fire from our Pudong artillery positions.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Advisory Committee Passes Resolution Condemning Japanese Bombing of Civilians</h3>
<p>This Case is Extremely Important in Political Significance; the League of Nations General Assembly May Now Impose Sanctions on Japan</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Sino-Japanese Problem Advisory Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly held a meeting this afternoon and unanimously passed a resolution proposed by British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Cranborne, strongly condemning Japanese aircraft for bombing Chinese cities that have no defensive works. (Havas News Agency, Geneva, 27th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Sino-Japanese Problem Advisory Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly held an open meeting this afternoon. The chairman, Latvian Foreign Minister Munters, the US observer, i.e., the Minister to Switzerland, Harrison, and the Australian representative, Bruce, were all present. The Chinese representative, i.e., the Ambassador to France, Dr. Gu Weijun, gave a speech stating that the bombing of Chinese civilians by Japanese aircraft violated international law and the basic principles of humanity. The League of Nations should at least condemn it and provide China with encouragement in order to curb the war. British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Cranborne, immediately suggested condemning Japanese aircraft for bombing Chinese cities without defensive works. French Foreign Minister Daladier, Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler, and Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov all expressed their agreement. The committee then adjourned to draft the resolution. It was immediately reconvened, and after a long discussion, it was unanimously passed and submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly for approval. The resolution stated: "This committee, after discussing the issue of Japanese air force bombing Chinese cities without defensive works using emergency procedures, is deeply shocked by the tragic death of innocent Chinese civilians, including many women and children. This is resented and condemned by people all over the world. This committee hereby declares that this behavior of the Japanese air force is inexcusable and solemnly condemns it." (Havas News Agency, Geneva, 27th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] After the Sino-Japanese Problem Advisory Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly passed the resolution today, League of Nations officials commented that its content clearly pointed out that Japan was engaged in aggression, causing tens of thousands of Chinese civilians to be killed and injured. This is extremely important in political significance. (Havas News Agency, Geneva, 27th)</p>
<p>[London] After the Sino-Japanese Problem Advisory Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly passed the resolution, well-informed British sources declared that the content of the resolution clearly pointed out Japan without any prevarication. Therefore, the League of Nations General Assembly may put forward a proposal advocating the implementation of sanctions against Japan. Whether Britain will participate in the joint effort will depend on the attitude of the United States. However, so far, the United States has not been very much in favor of the idea of taking joint action to deal with Japan. In addition, according to news from Geneva, the United States will accept participation in the Pacific countries conference. Well-informed British sources were quite surprised to hear this because the United States has always opposed this. (Havas News Agency, Geneva, 27th)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Advocate Boycotting Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Newspapers of All Parties Unanimously Advocate; Various Organizations Also Pass Resolutions</p>
<p>[London] Here, because of opposition to Japanese aircraft bombing Chinese cities, a movement to boycott Japanese goods was organized. Now, because a Japanese submarine recently sank eleven Chinese fishing boats without any military reason in Hong Kong waters, causing the deaths of 300 Chinese fishermen, male and female, this movement has greatly developed. The British authorities in Hong Kong have dispatched personnel to investigate whether there are any British subjects among the victims. If so, they will lodge a serious protest with the Japanese government. At present, people from all walks of life in the United Kingdom, including officials, are extremely indignant at the methods of warfare used by Japan. The Daily Herald, the organ of the Labour Party, took the lead in advocating a boycott of Japanese goods. The Liberal Party's News Chronicle followed suit, calling on all public opinion circles to rise up together to achieve the boycott, and published a list of Japanese goods to be boycotted. The party's Manchester Guardian also made the same argument. Even The Times published many letters from readers, all putting forward the same proposal. The Peace Building Movement Committee, chaired by former Liberal Prime Minister Lloyd George and the Society of Friends, also passed a resolution this afternoon, advocating the imposition of economic pressure on Japan to stop violence against China. In addition, most members of the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress now advocate that workers in all industries, such as dockworkers, who serve Japanese businesses, should take collective action to boycott them. They believe that if Britain can take the lead in launching a boycott movement, the United States, France, and other countries will certainly follow suit. The Labour Party's annual congress is scheduled to open in Bournemouth in the middle of next week, and this issue will certainly be discussed. (Havas News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Hong Kong Do Not Wish to Return to Their Country</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] The anti-war movement among Japanese residents in Hong Kong is fierce. Japanese people such as Jingyi Pharmacy have requested naturalization from the Hong Kong government. The Hong Kong government ordered them to renounce their nationality before they could be processed. On the evening of the 20th, the Japanese consulate held a meeting on the fourth floor of 20 Des Voeux Road, ordering all residents to return home to avoid danger. The chairman, Mr. Takagaki, and the vice-consul, Mr. Okamoto, argued heatedly and questioned the Japanese government's purpose in waging war against China. A portion of the Japanese people remaining in Hong Kong have expressed their determination not to leave Hong Kong to return to their country. (Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Establishment of Customs in Shanghai Draws Close U.S. Attention</h3>
<p>Japanese Planes Continue Bombing Nanjing; British Ambassador Questions Japanese Vice-Minister</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull, when meeting with reporters today, stated that the U.S. government is currently paying close attention to the establishment of a customs office by the Japanese in the Shanghai area. The government is studying the overall situation in China, which may develop as it did in 1932-33, when Japan forcibly seized control of the Dalian Customs. Hull also stated that he has no knowledge of reports from Geneva that the United States will participate in a London conference to discuss Far Eastern issues. (Central News Agency, 27th, Reuters)</p>

<p>[Hong Kong] The Taikoo company ship "Soochow" sent a radio message stating that it rescued four Japanese airmen 30 miles outside Xiamen. All four were wearing life preservers, swimming in the sea. A destroyed aircraft was floating nearby. This plane was likely one of those that bombed Guangzhou yesterday, and was shot down into the sea while returning to Taiwan after being hit by anti-aircraft fire. (Central News Agency 28th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Our Fishermen Massacred by Enemy Troops</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou] According to foreign sources, on the 22nd of this month, a Japanese submarine pursued Chinese fishing boats south of Hong Kong's territorial waters, sinking all twelve of them. Over 300 fishermen and their families died. At the time, the German mail ship "Saar" was passing through the area and rescued ten people, all of whom were seriously injured. After arriving in Hong Kong, they were immediately sent to a hospital for treatment. According to an investigation by the Hong Kong authorities, all the sunken fishing boats were registered with the Hong Kong government. The Hong Kong government is now considering how to sanction this Far Eastern piracy, so that fishermen can safely fish near Hong Kong waters. (Central News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The German ship "Hoerst" arrived here today, carrying ten Chinese people rescued at sea. According to the captain, this morning, many people were seen far outside Hong Kong, on a raft floating on the sea. The ship was brought closer, and nine men and one woman were found, three of whom were seriously injured. The crew immediately rescued the survivors, administered first aid, and provided food and clothing. According to the survivors, they were fishermen, more than 300 in total, divided among twelve fishing boats. On September 22, while fishing outside their [unclear transcription] Cape, they were suddenly attacked by a Japanese submarine. Only one fishing boat managed to sail away under gunfire, while the other eleven were sunk one by one. Injured men, women, and children were struggling and screaming in the water, but the Japanese submarine continued its killing work without offering assistance, and finally sailed away. Only these ten people survived. Most of these people are injured and have been sent to a hospital. It is estimated that about 100 women and children and about 200 men died. Most Chinese fishermen use their boats as homes, with all their families on board, so there were so many deaths. Most of them were from Macau and Guangzhou. It is said that some of them were registered in Hong Kong, so the Hong Kong police are investigating. (Central News Agency, 27th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Lieutenants Oppose the War</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to foreigners coming to China from Japan, the Japanese warlords' war of aggression against us is draining the people and wasting money, with no victory in sight. Army lieutenants are expressing extreme dissatisfaction and are brewing internal changes. The Japanese control faction within the military instigated this aggression against China, intending to force army lieutenants to unite against the outside world. They executed Kita Ikki and others involved in the February 26 Incident and shelved the reform plan in an invisible way. Now, domestic prices in Japan have soared by 30%, and people's livelihoods are difficult. Army lieutenants believe that this result is clearly due to errors in the military strategy of senior generals, leading to a protracted and unsuccessful military campaign against China, sacrificing lower-ranking officers. They deeply resent this. If the war is prolonged, there will be internal changes. Furthermore, the Japanese central intelligence agencies are exaggerating and falsifying military intelligence, with countless contradictions. The highest Japanese authorities have expressed distrust and have ordered the Ministry of Imperial Household to separately subscribe to newspapers from France, Germany, and England for reference. (Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway</h3>
<p>[Hangzhou] At 10 PM on the 26th, three enemy planes bombed Jinhua Station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, dropping a total of five bombs. The tracks were slightly damaged. Two station staff were killed and one seriously injured. Twelve family members of staff died. Over 40 residents in the vicinity were killed by the bombing. Quxian Station was also bombed by enemy planes on the 26th, killing over 20 refugees and injuring 6. (Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Zhenjiang] At 10 AM on the 27th, twelve enemy planes passed over Zhenjiang to attack Nanjing, then immediately fled back, heading east. At 12:30 PM, another nine enemy planes, in two groups, circled back and forth in the sky between Zhenjiang and Nanjing, observing for several weeks. At 2 PM, they flew east and dropped a bomb on Heshan Island across from Jiaoshan in Zhenjiang, but it did not explode and there was no loss. (Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Henglee Bank Announces Commencement of Liquidation</h3>
<p>Henglee Bank, after a shareholders' meeting decided to liquidate and appointed accountant Pan Xulun and lawyer Wu Linkun as liquidators, has established a liquidation office at the corner of Tianjin Road and Henan Road.

<h3>Special Cotton Vest Sewing for War Zone Refugees</h3>
<p>A wartime sewing workshop composed of male and female refugees from the war zone is now specializing in sewing cotton vests, etc., to serve the soldiers on the front lines, to fulfill the will to save others and help themselves. A small fee of eight cents per item is charged, including needles and thread. Those interested in commissioning work can contact Mr. Yu at 16 Quan Xin Li, Annakin Road, French Concession, back door, 3rd floor (Zhu Jin Ji).</p>
<h3>Old Clothes Donation Campaign</h3>
<p>Tens of thousands of refugees in simple clothing and half-rations, the weather is getting colder, starvation is a danger.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of refugees in our rear areas mostly escaped from the war zones in a hurry, wearing only simple clothing and having only half-rations, a truly pitiful situation. As the autumn wind brings coolness and the weather turns cold, they will face the danger of freezing and starving. In light of this, our group has launched a "Old Clothes Donation Campaign" so that every household knows and understands, turning useless old clothes into useful relief. It is hoped that all salvation groups in this city will promote it together, and that citizens will enthusiastically donate and send donations directly to the City Relief Committee, or to the recruitment office of the team at Guangxia Middle School, Moller Road.</p>
<h3>Minor Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>The case of embezzlement of donations to the Asia Sound Radio Station. What is the situation? The authorities should seriously investigate.</p>
<p>We are now in a long-term war of resistance. The economic needs of the rear are no less important than the military supplies of the brave soldiers on the front lines. Therefore, those who raise money under the name of "Donations to save the nation" are met with the generous contributions of the people. The authorities are not in a position to stop this, but "taking advantage of the chaos" inevitably occurs.</p>
<p>At this critical juncture for the survival of the nation and the people, there are actually people who are "taking advantage of the chaos". These people are as heartless as traitors. Traitors seek the benefit of the enemy to harm the country. These people take advantage of national disaster to enrich themselves. Their crimes may even be worse than traitors. Therefore, this kind of "taking advantage of the chaos" should be treated the same as traitors once it is investigated and confirmed. Otherwise, the number of people who think it is profitable will only increase.</p>
<p>Although these people did not swallow everything completely, some of it still went to the public. These people know that if they put everything in their own pockets, it will be easily discovered. Therefore, they have to drop some of it as a way to deceive themselves. This is a case of people who pretend to be generous and revel in disaster. They are insane and infuriating.</p>
<p>At this time, although the government does not have time to pay attention, the people should have a sense of conscience. The general public should rise up to closely monitor and report them at any time. This is also the responsibility of the people.</p>

<h3>Jinan Suffers First Enemy Air Raid</h3>
<p>Nine Civilians Injured, Enemy Aircraft Damaged and Retreats; Yanzhou and Jining Counties Also Bombed by Enemy Aircraft</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Enemy aircraft have repeatedly flown here for reconnaissance, but without dropping bombs. Yesterday (21st), they suddenly bombed, marking the first time Jinan City has suffered an enemy air raid. Earlier, three enemy aircraft flew south along the Jinpu Railway from Cangzhou in the morning. After bombing passenger trains, two aircraft flew back and were discovered over Jinan at 10:40 AM. The city had not heard an air raid warning beforehand, so there was no defense. After the enemy aircraft arrived in Jinan, they first flew east from Weishi 2nd Road, circling twice for about ten minutes. Upon reaching Kuangshi Street outside the West Gate, seeing many vehicles, horses, and pedestrians, they dropped bombs in succession and strafed with machine guns. Our anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns immediately concentrated fire on the enemy aircraft. For a time, the sound of gunfire formed a sheet over the open space. The aircraft hastily fled north, dropping two more bombs near Nantianshan, south of Luokou, fortunately without injuring anyone. Near the Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge, four shells fired by our anti-aircraft guns hit around the aircraft. The aircraft was damaged but still managed to fly. In the afternoon, the Sangzidian Station on the Jinpu Railway (40 li north of Jinan at Luokou), according to a report from an old man surnamed Yang in Gengzhen, 30 li northeast of the station, an enemy aircraft flew very low over the town, no more than 100 feet above the ground, and was about to crash. He requested an inspection. Police Chief Li of the station telegraphed Section Chief Zhao of Jinan Station, who immediately sent someone by handcar to investigate. The Jinan Air Defense Commander also sent personnel to search. They found the damaged enemy aircraft stuck there after crashing. Later, Jiyang County Chief Xi Junchang reported that the aircraft had crossed the border and headed north. Whether it flew back to Tianjin or crashed elsewhere is still awaiting report. As for Jinan City, the enemy aircraft dropped a total of five bombs. One landed on the road in front of the Wanhetang pharmacy on Guyi Cloth Street, but did not explode. One landed on the Changyucheng sack shop at No. 31 Kuangshi Street, penetrated through the front roof into the ground, but did not explode. One landed on a stone in front of the teahouse at No. 37 Kuangshi Street and exploded immediately, injuring nine people: Li Zhou Shi, Li Yufen (female), Liu Shangtian, Yu Qishan, Liu Yiting, Lian Jinhua, Zhang Shuqin, Bian Chunting, and one staff member of the nearby Zhenxingdong shop. The injured were either staff from nearby shops, hawkers, or pedestrians. The injuries were to the legs and abdomen. Li Zhou Shi and Liu Shangtian were more seriously injured, the others slightly. They were sent to the Provincial Hospital for treatment. At 7 AM on the 22nd, two enemy aircraft were spotted in Rizhao County, passing from southeast to northwest through Linyi, Zouxian, and Ziyang, over Jining, circling for a long time and dropping five bombs. Two landed at the station, two at the parade ground, and one inside the city. Our losses were minimal. The aircraft immediately returned east. At 2:15 PM, 20 enemy aircraft were spotted in Juxian County, from east to west, 11 of which passed through Yishui and Feixian to Yanzhou, circling for more than 20 minutes, strafing with machine guns, and dropping 27 bombs, but only a few exploded, with little damage. After being strafed by our troops, one aircraft was hit and caught fire, crashing near the station. Both pilots were killed instantly. A machine gun and an eight-tone pistol were burned beyond repair. The other aircraft, seeing the situation was not good, fled east in a panic. The other nine aircraft scouted the border area through Feixian, Zouxian, and Qufu and immediately turned southeast. At 3:50 PM, one enemy aircraft arrived over Sangyuan Station from the north and dropped seven bombs, injuring one railway policeman and one merchant, before returning north. Also, at 7:09 AM on the 20th, one enemy aircraft was spotted in Rizhao, passing through Linyi and Zouxian and flying west. At the same time, two aircraft arrived in Jining, dropping three bombs. One landed heavily inside the city, causing unknown losses. After strafing the station with machine guns, they passed through Lincheng and Tengxian and headed east. Around 8 AM, two enemy aircraft arrived in Xuzhou and bombed, dropping bombs at the Longhai Station before flying back, with no major losses.</p>
<h3>Tragic Scene of Enemy Planes Bombing Baoding</h3>
<p>Houses Destroyed for Three Consecutive Days; Station En Route from Baoding to Shijiazhuang Bombed</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Correspondence: The fighting on the Pinghan Railway, before the 4th of this month, the enemy had not yet crossed the Yongding River, so the Pinghan Railway line and all the important front-line areas of Baoding were completely quiet as usual. Until the afternoon of the 15th, intelligence revealed that four enemy divisions had arrived on the north bank of the Yongding River, attacking south very urgently, with the intention of crossing the river to attack our four counties of Gu, Ba, Xiong, and Ren, directly threatening Baoding. In the evening, further reports indicated that the enemy divisions had indeed crossed the river forcibly under the cover of a large number of aircraft and artillery on the night of the 14th and the morning of the 15th. The two regiments of our defending troops ××× were completely martyred. On the night of the 15th, news from the front gradually became critical, and our army was also preparing to respond. At 6 AM on the morning of the 16th, 27 enemy aircraft suddenly bombed Baoding city for two hours. All important institutions such as the station and the provincial government were largely destroyed. The exact number of deaths and injuries could not be ascertained at that time. According to a survey by the fourth branch of the Baoding West Gate, there were more than 100 casualties in its jurisdiction alone. It can be imagined elsewhere. Moreover, enemy aircraft remained over Baoding throughout the day, and all institutions in the provincial capital were temporarily suspended. In the evening, dark clouds gathered, and everyone thought they could get a moment of peace, but enemy aircraft still came to raid at night. At that time, people could only wait for death, and all means of resistance were ineffective. They could only let them wreak havoc. From about 9 PM to 10 PM, bombing continued. The losses and casualties inside and outside the city were impossible to estimate. It was truly tragic. On the 17th, in the early morning, noon, and late at night, enemy aircraft still bombed heavily twice. Many residential caves were shaken and collapsed. Corpses were everywhere in the city, with no one to bury them. Most of the houses and buildings were destroyed. On the 18th, enemy aircraft still came to Baoding to bomb, and there were as many as 20 aircraft. Under these circumstances, the reporter had to leave Baoding and travel south. Looking back to the north, Baoding provincial city was filled with smoke and the fire was shining through the sky. In the afternoon, arriving at Liuzhuang, 15 li from Baoding, three enemy aircraft followed one after another. In the evening, I heard news that Baoding had been bombed three times in one day. At the same time, the large and small stations between Baoding and Shijiazhuang were destroyed by enemy aircraft without exception. Either the houses collapsed or the tracks were in disarray. However, the workers along the road were still repairing them as they were destroyed and quickly restored train operations. Shijiazhuang suffered heavy losses from enemy bombing on the 13th. On the 19th, enemy aircraft bombed again. The roof tiles of the station were destroyed, and the dead and injured were lying on the streets. All of this is still vividly in front of me. The reporter then left Shijiazhuang and continued south, stopping in Zhengzhou. (20th)</p>
<h3>Fudan and Great China Universities Prepare to Establish a Joint University</h3>
<p>Classes begin in mid-October; location: Guizhou and Jiangxi</p>
<p>Fudan, Great China, Datong, and Guanghua, four private universities in Shanghai, recently petitioned the Ministry of Education for permission to move to the interior and establish a joint university. The Ministry of Education has approved and promised substantial subsidies. Recently, Datong and Guanghua decided to open classes in Shanghai and withdrew from the joint university. However, the authorities of Fudan and Great China Universities are determined to continue. The Shanghai preparatory office has been established, located at 31, Lane 1136, Yuyuan Road (west of Eddie Avenue, telephone 21354). Currently, the presidents of the two universities, Qian Xinzhiju and Wang Baiwei, are still in Nanjing, continuing to make plans with the government on the spot. The vice presidents, Wu Nanxuan and Ou Yuanhuai, have jointly gone to Jiangxi to work with the provincial government to determine the location, which will be decided and announced soon. The joint university plans to establish the first division in Pingxiang (or Ganzhou) in Jiangxi and the second division in Guiyang in Guizhou. The organization is divided into five colleges, eighteen departments, and one specialized course. The Shanghai office is busy transporting books and equipment. It is heard that students from the two universities who wish to go to the interior to continue their studies at the joint university can register at the Yuyuan Road office starting today.</p>
<h3>Ancient Temple in Pudong Destroyed by Japanese Planes</h3>
<h3>British Merchants Restore the Beijing-Hankou Shipping Route</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, after our government blockaded Jiangyin, the upstream and downstream shipping of the Yangtze River was cut off. Various Chinese shipping companies, such as China Merchants, Sanbei, NingShao, and Minsheng, etc., operated riverboats on the Beijing-Hankou, Beijing-Yichang, and Beijing-Chongqing routes to maintain traffic on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Various foreign ships had suspended operations for quite some time. It is now learned that the British merchants Taikoo and Jardine Matheson shipping companies have also decided to restore Yangtze River shipping routes for the sake of maintaining British interests. Taikoo is sending the Wusong and Wuchang ships, and Jardine Matheson is sending the Ruihe and Gonghe ships to operate on the Beijing-Hankou shipping route from Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, to Hankou, starting today, with a scheduled departure every three days. If business requires it, more departures will be gradually added. Furthermore, the China-Italy Shipping Company's Ende, and the Taikoo Shipping Company's New Beijing will operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, carrying passengers and cargo. As for foreign ocean liners, such as the Java Mail Line's Tjisaljak, are scheduled to depart for Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Java on the 29th. The French Mail Line's Chella departs from Wusong on the 12th for Hong Kong, Saigon, Singapore, Colombo, Djibouti, Port Said, Marseille, and other places.</p>
<h3>American Residents from Qingdao and Yantai Transit Through Shanghai to the Philippines</h3>

<h3>The General Labor Union Cables the British Trades Union Congress to Thank Them for Their Sympathy</h3>
<p>Also hopes for further steps to promote the implementation of sanctions to ensure East Asian peace and international security</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union, in response to reports that the British Trades Union Congress sent a letter to our Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, expressing indignation at the enemy's indiscriminate bombing and destruction of living beings and extending condolences to our government and nation, yesterday sent a telegram to the Congress expressing gratitude. The original text read: "To the British Trades Union Congress, greetings. This time, the violent Japanese lightly started the war and invaded China with heavy troops, disregarding international law, extinguishing justice and humanity, recklessly disregarding everything, destroying cultural and educational institutions, and massacring innocent women, children, and refugees. They even attacked Mr. Hugessen, your country's ambassador to China. Recently, they have intensified their efforts and carried out large-scale bombings of our capital and Guangzhou. Their vicious and brutal acts have aroused the deep disgust of fair-minded people around the world. For the sake of upholding justice, your Congress has expressed deep indignation at the barbarous acts of the violent Japanese and has conveyed sincere condolences to our government and nation in a letter to Ambassador Guo. Upon hearing this, our union, on behalf of 800,000 workers in Shanghai, expresses its infinite gratitude for your Congress's deep sympathy. We hope that you will take further steps to enable your government to implement sanctions against aggression in order to ensure East Asian peace and international security. We are especially grateful. The Shanghai General Labor Union bows in respect."</p>

<h3>YongAn Cotton Mill in Wenzaobang Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Capital of 12 Million Yuan; Machinery and Assets Looted</p>
<p>According to refugees from the Wenzaobang war zone in Wusong, who fled to Shanghai yesterday afternoon, when speaking to a Huadong News Agency reporter, after our army withdrew from Wenzaobang, the enemy occupied it as a major base, resulting in the Second Factory (i.e. the original Great China Factory) and the Fourth Factory of YongAn Textile Company being completely looted, suffering very heavy losses. The two factories had a capital of 12 million yuan, one built in the tenth year of the Republic of China and the other built in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, both being the most modern buildings in Shanghai. Currently, the spinning and thread making machines and other equipment in the factories have been looted.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Transports Grain</h3>
<p>Totaling Twenty-Six Trucks</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession exerted all possible efforts on the previous two days (Sunday and Monday) to transport various staple foods stored north of the Suzhou River. The Council obtained passage permits for 787 trucks from the Japanese authorities, but because there were too many people moving miscellaneous goods at the time, there were not enough vehicles to divide, and due to the short amount of time, only 36 trucks of food were transported in two days. Since the Japanese authorities have already issued passage permits, the Council hopes that there may be another opportunity to transport the remaining goods in the future.</p>
<h3>Returning Overseas Chinese from Japan to Return to Their Native Places Tomorrow Morning Separately</h3>
<p>Ningbo Natives Take the New Beijing Steamer, Fujian and Guangdong Natives Take the Original Steamer</p>
<p>Five hundred and fourteen overseas Chinese from Japan, who traveled from Kobe on the British Taikoo Company's Xinjiang steamer, returned to China. The Guangdong, Fujian, and Ningbo native place associations all sent personnel to welcome them.  Except for the two hundred and thirty-six Ningbo natives who will transfer to the company's Shanghai-Ningbo line new Beijing steamer to return to Ningbo tomorrow morning, the remaining Fujian and Guangdong natives will all take the original steamer, scheduled to sail to a certain place near Fuzhou first at ten o'clock tomorrow morning, then to Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, escorting each overseas Chinese back to their native place. Furthermore, thirty-seven Ningbo natives returning from Japan who arrived in Shanghai on the Sichuan steamer will also take the new Beijing steamer to return to their native place tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Native Place Association in Shanghai Establishes Refugee Shelter</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai on August 13th, most of the Jiangxi workers in Shanghai, who were mainly engaged in industry such as crate and woodworking in the Zhabei area, were unable to escape and have been in distress on the streets like beggars for over a month.  Now, Ouyang Lin, Jiang Bozhang, and others from the province have initiated the organization of the Jiangxi Refugee Shelter in Shanghai, temporarily located at No. 26 He Ming Li, Yu Chang Li, Caishi Road, French Concession.  They have begun to take in refugees.  Yesterday and today, they have already taken in more than 500 people, and more are coming.  They feel that the residence is too small and difficult to accommodate everyone.  It is said that they plan to contact the Charity Organization Federation and the Shanghai Relief Association to find a larger residence.</p>
<h3>A Civilian House in Pudong Penetrated by Japanese Shells</h3>
<h3>Westerners Donate Gauze to Comfort Our Wounded People</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, enemy planes have bombed and shelled innocent civilians everywhere, causing resentment among foreigners, who have offered material assistance to our country to express their sympathy. Yesterday, Mr. DMFcoives, a Westerner from the British Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, personally went to the Pudong Red Cross Tenth Ambulance Team to donate 150 yards of high-quality gauze. Another Westerner, signing as Josuer, donated 20 yards and gave words of comfort to the wounded people. From this, one can see a glimpse of the sympathy of foreigners for our country.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Yili Donate 1,000 Yuan to Help Refugees</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Relief Committee in Yili, Dutch East Indies, specifically donated 1,000 yuan in national currency for the purpose of relieving refugees in the domestic war zone, which was remitted to the local Charity Organization United Relief Association for the purpose of relieving and accommodating refugee compatriots.</p>
