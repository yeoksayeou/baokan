<p>時評</p>
<h3>德國能與英法妥恊否</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>最近一個月來。德國外交顯示空前的活躍。國防部長白降培去英參與加冕典禮之後。又飛往羅馬。與墨索里尼會晤。外長牛賴特不久以前去巴爾幹。下週又將往訪倫敦。此外。經濟部長沙赫特上月去法。商談經濟合作。現參謀總長貝克又到巴黎。與法參謀總長甘茂林會晤。這許多軍事•外交•財政人物的出動。據政治觀察者的推測。表示德國正謀與英法接近。因此歐洲的大局。不久或將有重要的發展。</p>
<p>但這所謂新發展。是指那一方面的呢。外交上的拉攏接近。只是一種表面上的姿態。要由這種姿態達到妥恊。必須在某種實際的問題上。能够表示讓步。成立諒解。在目前歐洲的嚴重局勢中。德國對於英法在什麼問題上能表示讓步呢。</p>
<p>目前歐洲有幾個重要的問題。西歐公約是一個。西班牙問題是一個。由羅馬柏林軸心所激動的中歐問題。也是一個。此外則德意對於法蘇捷蘇的集體安全結合所表示的反對。也可說是一個。在過去數月中德意兩法西斯巨頭結成聯盟。共同阻梗西歐公約的訂立。公然援助西班牙叛軍。甚至積極增强羅馬柏林軸心。企圖網羅中歐各弱小國家。以截斷英法蘇的廣大聯合。這種種。表示德意絕未有對英法妥恊的傾向。却反有恢復一九一四年大戰的中歐同盟。與英法俄造成正面對壘的形勢。</p>
<p>那麼現在為什麼德國又回轉頭來。表現為對英法拉攏妥恊的姿態呢。是感到一九一四年大戰前威廉二世的拙劣外交所闖下的大禍。所以眞心悔悟了嗎。表面上似乎是的。實際上却不一定可靠。我們看到。這次進行對英法拉攏的是國防軍的首領與代表德國傳統外交的牛賴特。而不是使英法感到嫌忌的戈林或里賓特洛浦之流。似乎德國的外交方式。確是與前不同了。然而在這種表面的方式之外。我們很難相信德意在目前歐洲的幾個重大問題上。有對英法眞下讓步之可能。</p>
<p>在目前。德意軍隊仍在西班牙半島。帮助叛軍進攻比爾波。他們絕不會放棄羅馬柏林政治軸心。而只有使這個政治軸心成為軍事軸心。對於法蘇•捷蘇互助恊定所造成的集體安全組織。他們更不會改變原來的反對立塲。唯一可能的是在西歐公約的訂文或歸還舊德領殖民地問題上。德國會表示某種程度的讓步。而他們所要求的代價。將是通過英國的關係。迫使法國與捷克放棄對蘇的互助關係。但是這種集體和平的結合被擊破了。德意是否會對英法維持長久的妥恊態度呢。這却又是一個大疑問了。由於這樣。卽使英國政府會上當。而法國政府必不許可。卽使張伯倫及其頑固的保守黨同僚會受到誘惑。而英國的開明人士必不許。所以昨日英國的“新聞紀事報”已提出警告。“英國若為一時的私利起見。放棄法國。放棄歐洲集體安全主義。是卽背叛民主陣綫。而世界和平亦必為之大受打擊。”這警告。使我們明白目前德國對於英法的接近。始終只是一種姿態。而絕少達到眞正妥恊的可能。羅馬講壇報雖然說得好。“歐洲今日比前已能有較自由的呼吸了。”但那裏來的自由空氣呢。</p>

<h3>都江堰的水利</h3>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>都江堰的工程尚不止此、內江自與外江分別稍稍下流卽到另一大工程飛沙堰一、此堰高二公尺、兼有湃水作用、卽內江流量過多、凡超出二公尺以外的水、可漫溢而出、復歸外江、不過此堤向來極易衝倒、尤其在四五月衝倒、正值插秧需水之際、非搶險修好不可、否則辦水利工程的主管人、至少須受拘役的處分</p>
<p>飛沙堰前、古人埋有鐵樁、每年淘灘、必以見鐵樁為標準、並築堰高二公尺、水才够用、又每年漫堰而出的水、若在四公尺以外、外江流域、就遭水災、另有小“挑水壩”一道、“滾水壩”道都是用竹籠實石卽所謂石籠砌成、以逼適度的水量、下注“寶瓶口”、寶瓶口鑿石岩而成、旁置水標、浪花飛雪衝岩作雷吼、入寶瓶口、卽李冰所鑿的“離堆”有石柱孤立不倒、稱象鼻岩堆下有深潭、岩邊還盤有大鐵練傳爲鎖孽龍處、水勢自亞扉岩而下、依削壁轉側衝激、從寶瓶口以極猛湧的速度、直瀉離堆之前、船筏極易出險、岩練或係備供攀援之用、</p>
<p>管理都江堰工程的、從前叫水利知事、二十五年、改稱水利局、已有全省性故附設一都江堰水利工程處、專管都江堰工程、工程分大修•歲修•二種、大修本應三年一次、入民國後僅民四修過一次、前年起至今年、决議大修預算經費六十餘萬、但事實上籌措困難、去年僅用去十四萬、就勉强把工程結束了、據說祇要每年的歲修成績好、大修也可多茍延幾年、</p>
<p>山索橋回首北望、蔚然深秀的山林中、有好幾院寺觀、層疊出沒其間、中有一大院叫“二郎廟”、卽祀繼其父李冰治水有功的二郎、門前岩碑上、刻有治河要訣云“乘勢利導、因時制宜、”又云、“深淘灘低作堰”六字旨、千秋鑒、挖河沙、堆堤岸、砌魚嘴、安羊圈、立湃闕、（卽飛沙堰）留漏罐、（指堰底開洞出水）籠編密、石裝健、分四六、平潦暵、（洪水　外六內四、枯水期外四內六、卽以折去榪槎多寡為標準、水畫符、（指水標）鐵樁見（卽淘灘務見鐵樁之意）歲勤修預防患、尊舊制、毋擅變、”其旁尚刻有“過灣截魚逢正抽心”數字離堆上、另有李冰祠、廟貌都非常莊嚴、</p>

<p>參觀都江堰的途程、出灌縣西門、走過鎮夷關及鳳樓窩、江流滔滔洪聲、越走越覺放大再越過張扉岩沿着樹林陰翳的一個坡脚西去、就看見橫跨江上高浮空際的安瀾索橋了、橋用索造索是剖竹紐成粗如盌口、平列九股、上舖木板、自此岸、牽彼岸、長達三四百步、兩旁另以竹索作欄以防危險、下面有高三四丈的支柱數架、兜承軟性墜垂之勢、行人平平走過、略有搖幌、若對面有幾個揹炭的夷人、故意連跳帶跑地走來、便要感到劇烈的顛簸了前人已經歌詠過“風飄飄雨搖搖川為衣帶虹為腰、我從橋上須臾立、天崗簸盪水怒號、神昏目眩心膽裂、橋不自搖人自搖、旁人語我神妙訣、東顧西盼心轉慴、”的確是這樣的、此橋每年要換竹索一次、需費一萬餘元、所費却也不少、可是若欲造石橋或鐵橋、第一、無從籌十百萬元的鉅欵第二、水性太急、衝力太大縱然造得起、也保不了幾年的險、</p>

<h3>招商局對輪機員要求改善待遇表示</h3>
<p>刻正詳加研究轉呈交部核示　員工應各安心服務靜候解决</p>
<p>國營招商局近接准中國輪機員聯合總會來函、以該局各輪全體輪機員、要求改善待遇、該局以籌議對於駕駛輪機報務領江各部份人員之加薪已在請示交部核定中、各輪機人員不乏深明大義者、應各安心服務、靜待解决、昨特發表告輪機人員書、新新社記者特摘要如次、</p>
<p>服從命令犧牲私見</p>
<p>招商局為交通部直轄之國營航業機關、所有員工、直接為該局服務、卽屬為國家服務應受政府政令之支配、如有與政府政令抵觸者、卽應絕對犧牲輪機人員、掌輪船中重要職務不能側重個人利害、置國家事業之利害於不顧、員工為國民一份子、今服務於國營機關亦卽為該局主人翁之一份子、與主管人員同其責任各主管人員、係代表政府執行政令者、各輪機人員以員工及主人翁之立塲言、除應服從該局所奉行之政府政令、盡量維護外、並有監督在上者、是否盡力奉行、在下者是否服從命令之責、</p>
<p>行為欠當未必有利</p>
<p>本局自上年春間厲行整頓局務、於今已十餘月其間革除輪船積弊、頗見船員之通力合作、各輪機人員、固亦有多數人、為擁護政府、推行整頓計畫之中堅份子、但亦不免有一部份思想錯誤、舉措乖謬者、如海亨輪各船員、在海外以要挾方式請求提高待遇、首要份子、卽屬諸輪機人員、乃近復有輪機人員十餘人、以要求提高待遇之故、自請辭職已經本局批示不准、所有類此行為、均屬久當、要非休戚與共之輪機人員所宜出此、本局從事觀察各輪機人員之不合理舉動、或屬受人煽惑所致、然在煽惑者之用心、不特希圖破壞國家交通事業、且於輪機人員之本身、亦未必有利、各輪機人員、應深長思之</p>
<p>薪給注重學識經驗</p>
<p>本局改組後對發展業務及改良人事管理諸端、莫不次　進行、卽行船員待遇問題、以向無專章規定、亦經參酌海商法及本局實際情形、草擬駕駛輪機報務人員待遇章程、呈請交部核示、此項章程、已將薪級獎懲、進退撫恤各項、分別重訂、尤於船員之學識經騐、及其服務成績、加以特殊注意、在未奉核定施行前、本局已將一部份船長之待遇、酌予提高外、並對於其他駕駛•輪機•報務•領江•各部人員之待遇、亦正從事準備、擬為合理之加薪、至各輪機人員之薪給、誠與駕駛人員略有軒輊、但其中實有特種原因、㊀歷來服務於輪船之輪機人員、除少數由專門學校出身者外、以由工匠積資遞升者為多、㊁由工匠升充者以有相當經騐、工作效能尚優、然於機械作用缺乏學理智識㊂由學校出身者、學識固佳但多側重理論缺乏經騐、且以不慣操作之故、遇事不能躬親執役、亦足影響工作效能、因此種種情形、故其所享受待遇乃不得不因而稍遜於他項技術人員、但就本局現行之待遇論、已較其他航業公司為優、各輪機人員、應自審度、勿徒供外誘之犧牲、</p>
<p>要求各點呈部核示</p>
<p>本局職責、重在執行政府命令、對於尊重國家紀律與維持本局業務不能偏廢、所有員工有所陳請、如於紀律業務兩無妨碍者、當可予以考慮接受、反是則無論任何犧牲、亦所不惜、各輪機人員、此次由中國輪機員聯合總會、向本局提出要求五點、本局當依據上述各項原則、及實在情形予以研究、並一面據情轉呈交通部核示、惟本局深感此項要求、超過現在薪給、百分之四十以上、殊非本局財力所能負荷、且國內輪船噸位外商占百分之七十、本國僅占百分之三十、如國輪以提高待遇、增加成本過甚、將必失其競爭效能殊非國家之福、再就提高輪機員待遇之原則言、大抵非由專門學校出身者、如果富有機械學識、當可與學校出身而具有經騐者、同等待遇、同時專門學校出身之人員、必須具有相當經騐、始可享受事實上可能給予最高待遇、在上述兩項人員中、設或學識經騐、未能兼備者、不能予以此項最高待遇也、</p>

<h3>市辦浦東水廠今日出水</h3>
<p>設計建造歷時兩年</p>
<p>本市市政府對於市區各項建設、近數年來繼續努力、已有長足之進步、而於繁榮浦東之計劃、尤加注意、如建築道路、擴充輪渡航綫等、均已使浦東市面呈現蓬勃之景象、故目前之浦東水陸交通電燈電話等、日常所需者、大致皆已應有盡有、其唯一缺點、即無自來水設備、市府有鑒及此、遂飭令興業信託社積極籌辦、該社奉令後、卽努力進行、精密計劃、費時兩年、現已完全落成、定於今日（十九日）正式出水、中央社記者昨特前往參觀、茲記詳情如下、</p>
<p>設備之大概</p>
<p>浦東水廠位於浦東游龍路、約在愛多亞路之對江、適居浦東最繁盛區域之中心、廠基佔地甚廣、淮水帮浦間卽在游龍路口、該處水位甚深、為浦東方面比較最合宜之水源、廠內全部建築、均屬最新式之設計、除上述之進水帮浦間外、計有沉澱池一座、快濾池一座、清水池一座、淸水帮浦間一所、完全為鋼骨水泥建築、並經加做避漏工程、清水池上用鋼骨水泥三和土封閉、上設透氣管十五只、水質可絕對保持清潔、另有水池一座專供冲洗快濾池之用、其餘如加礬機、加氯氣機、化騐各種儀器等、亦均採用最新式者、尤以化騐設備更為完備新穎、辦公室亦頗寬大清潔、至該廠所用機器、均以電力發動、效率高而管理易、進水間有混水馬達帮浦二座、當取水時、先有馬眼鋼網、隔絕魚類之流入、復有銅絲網、阻止粗砂之吸收、出水間有清水馬達帮浦二座、並聞該廠現又添購清水間加氯氣機一隻、以策萬全、總計各項建築設備等、信託社投資已達國幣約八十萬元、</p>
<p>製水及化驗</p>
<p>該廠進水間吸入之混水、經加礬間以機力加入適當溶和之礬水而至沉澱池、沉澱池內有水泥板各別分格、以阻水力之暢流、俾已加礬之混水、經過紆廻曲折、得以漸次沉澱、迨達快濾池時、水質己清明如鏡復經沙濾之後、會集於淸水池、並經用氯氣機加放氯氣消毒殺菌後、方由清水帮浦間輸出、至該廠關於水質化騐、尤屬不惜鉅資、購辦最新式最準確之儀器、聘用專門技師、專司化騐水質、每日先將浦江混水化騐、俾知水內所含砂泥及細菌之多寡、以定應加礬質之數量、混水經沉澱沙濾後、再行化騐、以明水質所含之各種成分復行試騐、以定消毒劑之數量、迨消毒後、再為細菌檢查、以證消毒劑之是否適宜此次在正式出水之前、除逐日由該廠化騐工程師自行化騐水質外、並逐日將水樣送請衛生局衛生試騐所化騐、現已完全合格、各路水管、晝夜用消毒後之清水冲洗、經市公用局徐局長特派主管科鄒科長親往該廠、逐部詳細檢騐合格後、核准出水、因該廠係屬市營、故水質務求絕對淸潔、以期保障市民衛生、故不得不格外愼重也、</p>
<p>給水之區域</p>
<p>該廠給水區域、目前第一步暫定南自塘橋、北至其昌棧、聞第二步南擬展長至白蓮涇、北至洋涇鎮、大約不久期內、卽將實行、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>衛生無道</h3>
<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>夏天了，大家想着“衛生”。凡是“人”，都希望“長命百歲”的。至於投機墮浦，失業跳樓，雖然里面還大有文章，不過就因為無法“長命”，才把自己的生命輕輕地交了閻王。所以孩子生下地來，就要請瞎子先生開通“關煞”；倘若還是不幸而夭折，則在屍體上砍它幾刀，希望取償於第二個孩子；亦“從頭做起”之意也。</p>
<p>這些都是“大意”。雖然有過一句“人定可以勝天”的話，終究亦勉强得很。於是補“天意”之不足者，就是“人事”；而“衛生之道”尚焉。</p>
<p>然而“衛生之道”亦各有其“道”，“百齡大會”的會員，就有他們自製的“衛生秘訣”，如“多做些事，少生些氣”。這“秘訣”果然有時也可以使人長壽，眼前的例，就是他們得以參加“百齡大會”。但亦有想“多做些事”而喪身者：在碼頭上爭裝鉛絲的季生合，就致“腸腕破裂，死於非命”（見昨日本報要“少生些氣”呢，只怪年青人太沒有涵養功夫，一言不合，馬上動手，前有南京路上吃自來水龍頭，後有緝私關員的“光榮的流血”不過他們的容易“生氣”，也是為—希望長命，—不是“個人”的而是“大衆”的。這或許發明“衛生秘訣”的所沒有想到。</p>
<p>這是其一。</p>
<p>第二拜是“衛生不訣。”晨服人參燕窩，晚打補血之針，好在他們有的是錢，恨不能集百補於一身。但是不明自己之體質若何，病根所在，等到要開“藥方”的時候，也使“諸醫束手”了。這叫做“自作孽”，不說也罷。</p>
<p>最可憐的是“衛生無訣”。他們明明是“身體薄弱，患吐血病”，但“略見痊可”的時候，又覺得“家無財產，需得一技”，乃由友人介紹至　斐德路某電料店學裝電燈工藝，以致“舊病復發，痛苦萬分”於是“頓萌知見”，從大世界四樓跳下。（見昨日本報）這又是一例。</p>
<p>寫到這里，本來可以擱筆了。但是，忽然想到這三者之外，還有一類是屬於强迫衛生的，雖然已經離題愈遠了；却又不能不談。舉一個最近的例，就是擱樓上的人物，工部局定要強迫他們“衛生”而拆除，其實他們豈不知“衛生之道”哉，有這一片衛生醫的初夏來到，他們亦已喬遷到人行道上安宿，青天為被，大地爲床了。</p>
<p>然而使人擔憂的，兜風汽車肇禍的新聞也將接踵而至了。</p>
<p>一言以蔽之曰：“衛生無道”！</p>
<h3>對於“武則天”的意見</h3>
<p>— 台生</p>
<p>（一）雜論劇本</p>
<p>以這一次演出的效果，以及演技之水準看，它比“羅密歐與朱麗葉”好多了。至少，演員個人的演技，都很平均，不像“羅密歐與朱麗葉”單單集中在兩個人的身上。</p>
<p>至於對於整個劇本的批判，這樣的歷史戲，本來就很難着筆，因為像這種古裝戲，我們旣不能完全根據古人，（而且也無從考據）更不能模倣舊劇；如使舉動太現代化了，一定又妨碍歷史劇的氣氛。</p>
<p>就拿“對白”一點說吧，也就可以看出劇作者寫這個劇本時候的困難了。比如第四幕，寫武則天後宮荒淫一段，武三思與武承嗣的“台白”，就現得太“咬文嚼字”了一點：第二幕武則天對高宗皇帝施用手段一幕對高宗稱“你”道“我”，與後來中宗皇帝的滿口“兒臣”“陛下”，前後完全不一致。這些地方，我相信不是作者文字的疏忽，而是作者拿不定主意，還使它通俗化呢，還是使它保持歷史上原來的面目？</p>
<p>就是拿高宗皇帝這一角色說吧，在作者與導演者的强調底下，這一位一朝的“天子”，竟被完全“小丑”化了。尤其是第三幕裏，高宗對武則天下跪，武則天頭戴皇冠，高宗跪伏武則天脚下。依我們想，一個皇帝就是昏庸，也不致於</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>昏庸到這步田地吧。</p>
<p>（二）“反常”的武則天</p>
<p>再拿劇本的中心看，本劇劇作者宋之的說是：“在傳統的封建社會下，—也就是男性中心的社會下，一個女性的反抗及掙扎。”</p>
<p>在“反抗掙扎”下的武則天又怎樣呢？她深惡男性，她盡量報復，這個“歇斯的里式”的，反常的女性，她故意虐殺男性，侮辱男性，妬恨男性，因之，有人說，這個劇本，有被寫成“女性與男性對立的危險”。</p>
<p>但是我以為，武則天在歷史上，只能算作一個“反常”的人物，我們絕對不能用現代的思想去責罰“武則天”，因為她在傳統的封建社會裏，她當然排擠別人，想自己抓握大權，因為她深恨男子，她才故意侮辱男性。</p>
<p>假如劇本眞眞想寫一個“女性與男性對立”的，那麼武則天絕對不會殺王皇后了。</p>
<p>（三）演技與舞台裝置</p>
<p>我所以要以演員的演技與舞台裝置並論，實在因為業餘的舞台裝置的確已超越了中國所有劇團的水準。</p>
<p>大體上，舞台的裝置，是放棄奢華絢爛，而趨向於明朗簡潔的。如第二幕武則天尚未出塲，台下觀衆，一看見那樣明朗而又幽美的舞台面，馬上竟鼓起掌來，這是屢次公演中所少見的。</p>
<p>現在讓我們看看幾個演員看：英茵的武則天，已經好到不能再好了，她的沉着，洗煉，在五幕戲裏，把武則天那樣人物，把握得異常强固；她的籌劃深想，她的狂笑憤怒，她的奪取政權，她的剛愎崛强，在中國女演員中間，她實在是一個少見的人材。</p>
<p>其餘能演戲的演員很多，如章曼蘋痛苦悲愴的妙眞；顧而已漫畫小凡化的高宗皇帝；熊輝的風騷寡婦韓國夫人；呂復的忠臣徐存功；都是極成功而又可愛的演員。</p>
<p>葉露茜的妙玉，似深受趙丹作風的影響，尤其是第一幕中尤甚。希望能自關一徑才好。呂班的薛懷義究竟是太過火了。王蘋的老尼還算是好的。</p>
<p>論演員，使我們滿意的居多。音樂比上一次好；燈光效果異常優美。</p>
<p>全部演出，第一，二，三最好，第四幕差一點；第五幕是失敗的。</p>
<p>拉雜寫來，算不得批評，只能算自己一點觀後感而已。</p>
<p>其二　　李一</p>
<p>要寫“武則天”的批評，那是不容易的。第一，至少批評者應該多讀一些關於武則天的史料，從此去與劇本對證一下是否有歪曲或武斷之處；第二，應該多讀幾遍劇本，好好地揣摹一下，其中是否有應該增刪的人物或事蹟。關於這些，我都沒有資格去做，我想也决不是一二個人就能做得了，替它下一個公正的評價的，這祇有用集體的力量，用座談的方式或許才能够應付得了。</p>
<p>現在是寫“觀後感”，較之“批評”自然又有不同。但實在也不容易討好。這工作尤其是在於我，更其是一個難題目，不過似乎也不妨寫一點，以期有千慮一得的用處，如果將來有座談，那麼也不妨算是提出來的幾個問題。</p>
<p>排歷史戲的最大困難，導演者沈西苓先生已經先我們而言之了：“那時的人物的動作和習慣，我們現在都無從考證。我們既不願意流入京戲的揮袖捋鬚的類型，我們也不能自作聰明地把現代的動作加進去。”這眞是很感“頭痛”的事情。要解决這困難，我以為，我們不妨假設有一個繩準，然後根據着它作為目標做去：這樣在演出上庶幾能够統一。如果未善，也可以在下個戲中改正。像這次的演出，以我所感到的，演員的動作便沒有趨於一律，例如葉露茜和嚴恭二位，他們的動作我便感到現代得並且有些洋化，前着尤其是在第一幕中，那動作是極應改過的。</p>
<p>關於這個戲的主題，大體上我是同意的，但不知怎樣，從直覺上，我總感到作者是隱隱然在把男女兩性對立起來；這大概是由於我的理解力太薄弱之故，所以也說不出所以然來。這樣的感覺固然並不怎樣强烈，我也祇希望這是我的偏見，但如果眞有，則我希望能够設法避免，因為未來的社會，决不是兩性</p>
<h3>救命！</h3>
<p>— 李絢作</p>
<p>以下接第三版</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>的排斥而是兩性的合作也。</p>
<p>在原來的劇本上（刋“婦女生活”），是有上官婉兒這角色的，上演的時候，却没有了。其他的地方，也有增删。上官婉兒的是否要删去這裏不談，但以“戲”來講，則上官婉兒的存在，我想是可以使活潑些的，尤其是在第五幕，一定能比現在活潑些。最後的那個高潮，我以爲如果縱火於後，效果也一定能更好，但未知時間上又有出入否。</p>
<p>關於舞台裝置和照明，我想用“空前”這兩個字來形容，這應該是毫無愧色的。演員們的演技，這裏也非常平均，非常特出，英茵的武則天非但超過了她以前演過的戲，其他幾位，也都有驚人的成就，像章曼蘋的妙真，熊輝的韓國夫人，她們的戲雖然很少，但在這裏却給你一個難忘的印象。這真是配置得最相宜的旗鼓相當的一張演員表。</p>
<h3>林野</h3>
<p>— 王仁東</p>
<p>這是初夏的早晨，我獨自散歩在這林野里。</p>
<p>碧空從灰色的雲中露出來，再從樹底枝葉間篩下；槐樹底羽形的葉子當微風吹來的時候，像掛在女人的耳上的環子一樣地左右擺着。甲虫吱吱地在脚下的草叢中呌着，這吱吱的呌聲，是這林野底幽静的襯托。</p>
<p>黑色的蝴蝶像紙灰一樣地翩翩地飛舞；映着陽光而閃着亮光的牽在枝頭的，這是蜘蛛吐出的絲。</p>
<p>白色的米形的野花撒遍在綠草的頭上。我踢開野草，露水惹濕了我的鞋子，偶爾有一隻灰色的兎子，在我的身前竄過去，没在深草叢中。……</p>
<p>天氣漸漸地陰下來了。老聲老氣的鵓鴣遠遠地在哼着催雨的歌兒；我找了一塊旁着水窪的碑石上坐下來，這水窪本來是山的低處被雨水的積聚而成的；淡綠色的水面反映着從樹葉底縫隙里篩下的天空，還有一些從上面的槐樹上所落下來的葉子飄浮在那上面。</p>
<p>一陣微風：槐樹底葉子又在像耳環一樣地擺着。</p>
<p>天更陰沉了，從樹底疎縫里，看不到一些兒晴空了，看到的只是昏沉沉灰色的雲。甲虫的聲音微細了；微風半響才來一趟。鵓鴣也不肯多呌了。這時只有近旁的樹上，有一只班鳩，忽然咕！咕咕地呌起來，沉鬱的像一個老人氣喘的喉嚨里的響聲一樣。咕！咕咕！</p>
<p>這整個的山林，這整個的綠色的山林，陰沉的山林，被牠呌得死去了。—只有沉鬱瀰漫在這里。然而這，打成一片平静的滋味，流曳到我的心里。</p>
<p>回來的時候，我從槐樹上拆下一些槐莢；牠們是青青的，有的微微帶着紅色；我要帶牠回家去，我讓牠們在我的心上，長一座這樣的林野，這樣林野底沉鬱，幽暗，綠。然而在牠們之中，我也要有像這槐莢似的掛在那枝上的一些希望的種子。</p>

<h3>申報娛樂專刊舞藝特輯發刊勗舞藝界</h3>
<p>— 伯樵</p>
<p>葛天氏始歌，蔭康氏始舞，歌舞之在吾國歷史上可謂悠久矣，聞嘗考世界各大民族，無論其已未開化，莫不各有其民族性之歌舞，蓋愛好音樂，愛好歌舞為人類之天性，似非人力之所能遏制者也。</p>
<p>今試捨歌言舞，世界各大先進民族，莫不各有其適合民族性之作風，美國為自由主義國家，其作風包含自由意義，法義兩國，愛好美術，其作風在在可表現美化，德俄則民性剛果，其姿勢動態，亦足表現其剛毅特性，英國人民，素以天生嬌子自况，上自仕紳，下及偏氓，無不以衣冠紳仕自視，故其動作一出溫文爾雅，是則各有其特殊民族性之作風，各適其所宜，何必盡同</p>
<p>歐戰以還，各國以英國式之交際舞，姿態自在，文雅大方，紛紛採用，卽俗稱所謂標準式，不足十年，其勢力幾遍及全世界，然仍能各自保持其民族性，各以其特性加以損益改造。</p>
<p>吾國為數千年衣冠禮儀之邦，其特性似與英國相同，自應順應潮流，採用英國式，然深望吾國舞藝界，羣策羣力，將來能截長袖短，加以再進一步之改造，正如吾人學書，始則臨帖，迨造詣旣深，得其神髓後，不妨略予變化，另創一格，此則有待乎多數舞藝界之努力耳。</p>
<h3>昨晚百樂門化裝宴舞大會盛况</h3>
<p>— 阿香</p>
<p>國際藝劇社昨晚假座百樂門舉行化裝宴舞大會，凡滬上中外人名人富紳幾無不蒞席，且多數化裝參加，塲內表演節目繁多，尤以我國精武體育會之國術表演最受歡迎，確為我國國術界生色不少；盛况空前，直至今晨一時始盡歡而散。</p>
<h3>樂隊介紹</h3>
<p>百樂門樂隊共十一人由GloriaAndicos女士領導，</p>
<h3>舞塲巡禮</h3>
<p>— 楠</p>
<p>所謂東方巴黎的上海，有摩天大樓•跑馬廳•跑狗塲•回力球•電影院•舞廳。關於夜生活方面，霞飛路•四川路各有各的異國情調，咖啡館•酒店，變相的人肉市塲，尤其是舞塲，雖然有幾家維持不了而停業，可是還不斷像雨後春笋般的產生着。</p>
<p>要是一個到上海來玩的人，不會不到舞塲去觀光一下，可是初到滬上的人，一點也不熟悉舞塲的內幕，除非是找了熟悉的朋友，但是這裏可以給你一些參考；要參觀富麗些的舞塲，那麼百樂門是去得的，舞池很適當，上面有一個玻璃舞池，裏面襯着彩色的燈光，是上海別家舞塲所沒有的，光綫音樂設備都出乎意料的幽美，此外我們可以到維也納去走走，那裏有特備的“豆瓣”及“蝦米”敬客，就是不跳舞的朋友，那麼在欣賞音樂之外，可以拿來消閒，同樣差不都的地方，就是對面的大都會，裏面的音樂是會使你特別的興奮，有很大的花園，佈置得很美麗，此外有麗都，也是一家相當富麗的舞塲，裏面有一個游水池，看跳舞之外，還可看游水，要是參观較便宜一些的塲所，那麼有楊子•大東•大滬•逍遙•國際•大新•國泰•爵祿•遠東•安樂宮，在大東裏有些新鮮的玩意兒，他們樂台是旋轉的，特為用了男女二班樂隊輪流演奏，在調換的時候，二班合奏一曲，那台便旋轉一個平角，一個開始休息。</p>
<p>在普通舞塲打烊以後，那麼不妨上大華去，他們的時間較人家遲一個半鐘點，人家打烊而他們却是熱鬧的時候，你可以看見客人帶了舞女或是舞女姊妹們，三五成羣的來玩，上面有屋頂花園，可以看看上海的夜色，萬一存心想玩一夜，那麼老大華是一個去處，地方是很普通，到　裏的人，大都是男女一對對的，你可以看見他們都靜靜的坐在一間間的籐椅上，很少跳舞，祇是找另一方面樂趣而已。</p>

<h3>Someone's Aggression Towards Jin and Sui Provinces: Recruiting a Large Number of Traitors</h3>
<p>Spreading Rumors to Undermine Unification, Authorities Have Already Taken Strict Precautions; Yan's Medical Examination Results are Good</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] According to reports from the Sacrifice to Save the Nation Alliance, a certain party is actively invading Jin and Sui provinces. Several months ago, they recruited 5,000 traitors in Taiyuan to go to Tianjin for training, where they were taught activity strategies. These individuals have already returned to Taiyuan in succession to carry out their work, which includes: ❶ Spreading rumors to undermine peaceful unification; ❷ Infiltrating various national salvation groups to disrupt the resistance against Japan movement; ❸ Inciting the people to oppose reasonable burdens; ❹ Spying on military fortresses and national defense construction. It is reported that some people are falsely using the name of the alliance to manufacture 100,000 badges to engage in sabotage. To strictly prevent this, the alliance has formulated nine anti-traitor guidelines, ordering its 800,000 members and military police to apprehend them. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] After Doctors Shi, Wu, and Li continued to examine Yan Xishan's illness last night and this morning, they prescribed medication.

The source of the illness has now been found; the stomach ailment is not very serious, but he has been diagnosed with diabetes, which should be cured in a short period. Zhao, Jia, Zhu, Yang, and Cui Tingxian were all present to care for him during the examination. Tonight, Zhu, Jia, and others will host a banquet at the Sui Residence to entertain the doctors.

<h3>Xu Shiying Arrives in Guling to Discuss Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Based on the Four Words "Justice and Sincerity," He Will Return to His Post After Meeting with Kawagoe</p>
<p>[Jiujiang] Guling Telephone: Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying arrived in Xun from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 17th. Due to the late hour, he stayed overnight at the Bamboo Forest Residence in Lianhua Cave. He ascended the mountain on the morning of the 18th, where he was greeted by Gan Kequan, the Director of the Administrative Bureau, and others. He arrived at around 11:00 AM and will visit President Jiang in the next few days for instructions. When reporters interviewed Mr. Xu at his residence, he said that he came to Lushan to visit President Jiang for instructions before returning to his post. He is scheduled to leave the mountain around the 22nd and travel to Nanjing, then to Shanghai. The original date for his departure to Japan was set for the 29th on the Hoover liner, but he received a telegram from Vice Minister Chen (Jie) stating that Ambassador Kawagoe would arrive in Shanghai on the Asama Maru on the 29th, and they would meet in Shanghai. Therefore, the 29th departure may not be possible, and the exact date will be determined after visiting President Jiang. When reporters inquired about his diplomatic policy after returning to his post, Mr. Xu said that he would continue to adhere to his previous principles, namely acting in accordance with the four words "Justice and Sincerity." Although the Japanese government has some misunderstandings about our country, we will always move them with "Justice" and touch them with "Sincerity." China is currently on the path to rejuvenation and urgently seeks to achieve satisfactory diplomatic results, which is difficult to do at the moment. We can only gradually improve relations between the two countries after resolving the difficulties and obstacles between China and Japan in a passive manner. I have always said that the key to a country's standing in the world lies within, not without. That is, the more united a country is internally, the higher its international standing will be. The change in international perception of our country after the Xi'an Incident is a practical example. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Wang's condition has improved after Doctors Qi Shounan and Song Wusheng, as well as his attending physician Luo Guanglin, jointly diagnosed and treated him for a recurrence of heart disease in the past two days. The doctors' opinion is that he should rest quietly in bed and should not handle affairs or receive guests within a week. It is best to take a leave of absence for two months to recuperate quietly in order to receive fundamental treatment. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Local News) Central Committee Member Chu Minyi came to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. When reporters visited him and inquired about his mission in Shanghai and Chairman Wang's condition, he said that he came to Shanghai to handle the affairs of the Sino-French Institute of Technology and preside over the graduation examinations. Chairman Wang came to Shanghai this Tuesday to give a speech to the students in training and to examine his health. He returned to Nanjing by night train on Wednesday and arrived in Nanjing at his residence the next morning. After resting briefly, he attended the Central Standing Committee meeting. After the meeting, he returned to his residence to read and reply to letters and telegrams. He had lunch at 12:00 PM, but before he could finish half of his meal, he felt unwell, his heart was beating very fast, and there were occasional pauses. He felt unable to support himself and moved to sit on the sofa to rest, but he still could not hold on, so he lay down immediately. Those who were dining with him saw that his complexion was poor and his limbs were cold, and they quickly called Dr. Qi from the Central Hospital for treatment. After taking the medicine, he felt a little more comfortable. Madam Wang happened to be in Shanghai at the time and was urgently called to Nanjing from Shanghai, accompanied by Song Wusheng. By the time they returned to Nanjing, it was already 8:00 PM. They immediately conducted another examination and jointly discussed treatment methods with Dr. Qi and how to avoid a recurrence of heart disease in the future. Wang had been found to have intermittent heart disease when he had a liver illness in the summer of two years ago. At that time, he went to Qingdao for treatment. Later, he was injured and underwent two surgeries in Nanjing and Shanghai to remove bullets from his back, experiencing great pain. The new injury caused the old illness to recur. He had an episode of intermittent heart disease while on a boat trip to Europe. The doctor advised him to go to Czechoslovakia for treatment. Since returning to China this spring, he had a recurrence in March, but it was very mild. This time, it was more severe than the previous episodes. The reason is that he has been giving speeches and instructions back and forth between Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai in recent days, and he has been overworking. In addition, the weather has been uncertain, which has triggered the old illness. His back sometimes feels painful. The blood sugar test he had in Shanghai a few days ago still showed more than one hundred and sixty parts per thousand of sugar. He should recover after resting for a few days. However, Wang has diseases of the gallbladder, liver, pancreas, and heart, so he must pay very close attention to his diet and daily life. He is quite disciplined with his diet at home, but it is not easy to control when he goes out for entertainment, so he must avoid banquets and avoid overwork. In particular, he should avoid hot places in the summer to recover his health more easily. (Central News Agency)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] The Finance, Economics, Legal System, Foreign Affairs, and Military Affairs Committees of the Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting in the Yuan meeting hall on the afternoon of the 18th to review the National General Budget for the 26th year. Ma Yinchu chaired the meeting. Yang Rumei and Ouyang Baozhen, representatives from the Directorate-General of Budget, and Li Tang and Pang Songzhou, representatives from the Ministry of Finance, attended to present their views. As a result, the committees decided that the content of the proposal was complex, and resolved that each of the five committees would nominate two members, together with the chairmen of the five committees, to form a subcommittee to conduct a preliminary review before reporting back to the joint meeting for discussion. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The draft of the Provisional Inheritance Tax Law was drafted by the Ministry of Finance based on the ten principles issued by the central government. After the proposal was delivered to the Legislative Yuan, Yuan President Sun assigned it to the Finance Committee, which in turn assigned it to committee members Chen Changheng, Zheng Hongnian, Liu Zhendong, Shi Weihuan, and Liu Tongwu for preliminary review. After discussion, Chen and others believed that inheritance tax and estate tax should be collected simultaneously. However, the central government's principles only mentioned collecting the total estate tax, without any provision for collecting inheritance tax. It was necessary to first change the principles before discussing the law. Therefore, they drafted a revised draft of the inheritance tax principles and submitted it to the Finance Committee for approval. The Finance Committee did not comment on Chen's proposal, but only resolved that the inheritance tax could be implemented later. If it must be implemented immediately, the Yuan meeting should decide whether to amend the inheritance tax principles. The Finance Committee itself was divided on the matter. Ma Yinchu, Shi Weihuan, and others advocated for delaying the inheritance tax, forming the faction for delay. Chen Changheng, Liu Zhendong, and others advocated for collecting inheritance tax and estate tax simultaneously, forming the faction for amendment. As a result, a fierce dispute erupted between the two factions during the Yuan meeting's review of the proposal on the 18th. The sharp exchange between Ma Yinchu and Chen Changheng was particularly remarkable. In addition, Yang Gongda, Lü Zhiyi, and other members who were not on the Finance Committee also spoke, either opposing Ma Yinchu's change of heart from his usual advocacy for the rapid implementation of direct taxes to suddenly advocating for delaying the inheritance tax, or opposing Chen Changheng's proposal to impose inheritance tax in addition to the central government's provision for collecting total estate tax. Liang Hancao and Lin Bin advocated for re-reviewing the proposal. After the chairman declared the debate closed, the proposal was reassigned to the Finance, Economics, and Legal System Committees for review, convened by Ma Yinchu. The chairman also instructed Ma to convene a joint meeting of the three committees immediately to elect members to a subcommittee for review, in order to ensure that the legislation of the proposal was thorough.

<h3>Motives Behind the Enactment of the Commercial Registration Law</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Commercial Registration Law has been under review by the Commercial Law and Civil Law Committees of the Legislative Yuan for three years. The motivation behind the enactment of this law stems from a request by merchants. Chambers of Commerce in various regions believe that Article 681 of the Civil Code, regarding joint and several liability of partnerships, hinders commercial development. They advocated for amending the article to change the partnership liability to several liability. The proposal was submitted to the Executive Yuan and then to the Legislative Yuan for review. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan resolved that Article 681 of the Civil Code did not need to be amended, and instead the Commercial Law and Civil Law Committees were to draft the Commercial Registration Law, and study the merchants' proposal for several liability in partnerships when drafting the law. The two committees have now meticulously drafted the law, and have made compromise provisions regarding the issue of partnership liability. If partners apply for registration according to law, they will still bear the joint and several liability of partnerships as stipulated in Article 681 of the Civil Code. If partners only register according to law, and their agreed capital contribution is not registered as a partner of the partnership, they will be regarded as a silent partner, and the provisions of the Civil Code regarding silent partners will apply. This compromise provision was unanimously approved by the Yuan meeting on the 18th. Huang Youchang proposed at the Yuan meeting to change the partnership liability to joint several liability, but it was not accepted by the Yuan meeting. Joint and several liability of partnerships means that, for example, in a partnership of three people, any one person is liable for the responsibilities of all three people. Several liability of partnerships means that, for example, in a partnership of three people, any one person is only liable for their own share of the responsibility. A silent partner refers to someone who invests capital but remains anonymous, and if the partnership business fails, they are only liable up to the amount of their investment. This approach can prevent unscrupulous individuals from using the names of well-known people in society to form partnerships to raise their business credit, attract customers, and defraud them of payments for goods, thereby protecting the interests of the general public. Furthermore, Article 29 of the Commercial Registration Law, passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 18th, stipulates that commercial registration shall be handled by the parties concerned with the competent authorities in the location of the business.

<h3>Northeastern Farmers Under the Iron Heel of the Japanese Army Endure Extreme Oppression</h3>
<p>Supporting the Old and Carrying the Young, They Flee into Russian Territory</p>
<p>[Moscow] Recently, Chinese and Korean farmers of good standing residing in the puppet state have been fleeing into Soviet territory in increasing numbers due to their inability to endure the cruel oppression of the Japanese puppet authorities. On June 3, Soviet border guards on the Russian bank of the Songhua River discovered seven farmers carrying all their possessions and livestock across the border into Russia. They were detained. After questioning, they claimed that they could not bear the oppression of the Japanese puppet authorities, so they entered Soviet territory to seek refuge. The next day, seven men and three women, carrying seven children, crossed into Soviet territory in the same area. On the 5th, another thirteen people moved in. They all said in unison that the reason for their escape was that the Japanese side was imposing unbearable oppression on the natives of the puppet state, especially those living in the border regions.

<h3>Can Germany Reach a Compromise with England and France?</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In the past month, German diplomacy has shown unprecedented activity. After Defense Minister von Blomberg went to England to participate in the coronation ceremony, he flew to Rome to meet with Mussolini. Foreign Minister Neurath went to the Balkans not long ago and will visit London next week. In addition, Economic Minister Schacht went to France last month to discuss economic cooperation. Now, Chief of the General Staff Beck has also arrived in Paris to meet with French Chief of the General Staff Gamelin. According to political observers, the dispatch of so many military, diplomatic, and financial figures indicates that Germany is seeking to approach England and France. Therefore, the overall situation in Europe may soon undergo significant developments.</p>
<p>But what aspect do these so-called new developments refer to? Diplomatic overtures are only a superficial gesture. To reach a compromise through this gesture, concessions must be made and understandings reached on certain practical issues. In the current tense situation in Europe, on what issues can Germany make concessions to England and France?</p>
<p>There are several important issues in Europe at present. The Western European Pact is one, the Spanish issue is another, and the Central European issue, stirred up by the Rome-Berlin Axis, is also one. In addition, Germany and Italy's opposition to the collective security alliance of France, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia can also be considered an issue. In the past few months, the two fascist giants, Germany and Italy, have formed an alliance to jointly obstruct the conclusion of the Western European Pact, openly aid the Spanish rebels, and even actively strengthen the Rome-Berlin Axis, attempting to enlist the various small and weak countries of Central Europe to cut off the broad alliance of England, France, and the Soviet Union. All of this indicates that Germany and Italy have absolutely no tendency to compromise with England and France, but rather to restore the Central European alliance of the Great War of 1914 and create a head-on confrontation with England, France, and Russia.</p>
<p>So why has Germany turned around now and shown a gesture of approaching and compromising with England and France? Does it feel remorse for the great disaster caused by the clumsy diplomacy of Wilhelm II before the Great War of 1914? On the surface, it seems so. But in reality, it may not be reliable. We see that it is the leader of the national defense forces and Neurath, the representative of traditional German diplomacy, who are carrying out the outreach to England and France, and not figures such as Göring or Ribbentrop, who are disliked by England and France. It seems that Germany's diplomatic approach is indeed different from before. However, beyond this superficial approach, it is difficult for us to believe that Germany and Italy can truly make concessions to England and France on the current major issues in Europe.</p>
<p>At present, German and Italian troops are still on the Iberian Peninsula, helping the rebels attack Bilbao. They will never abandon the Rome-Berlin political axis, but will only make this political axis a military axis. They will not change their original opposition to the collective security organization formed by the Franco-Soviet and Czech-Soviet mutual assistance agreements. The only possibility is that Germany will show some degree of concession on the wording of the Western European Pact or the issue of returning former German colonies. And the price they demand will be, through the relationship with England, to force France and Czechoslovakia to abandon their mutual assistance relations with the Soviet Union. But if this collective peace alliance is broken, will Germany and Italy maintain a long-term attitude of compromise with England and France? This is another big question. Because of this, even if the British government is fooled, the French government will not allow it. Even if Chamberlain and his stubborn Conservative Party colleagues are tempted, enlightened people in England will not allow it. Therefore, yesterday's "News Chronicle" in England issued a warning: "If England abandons France and abandons European collectivism for the sake of temporary self-interest, it will betray the democratic front, and world peace will suffer a major blow." This warning makes us understand that Germany's approach to England and France at present is only a gesture, and there is little possibility of reaching a true compromise. Although the "Roman Tribune" says it well, "Europe today can breathe more freely than before." But where does the free air come from?</p>
<h3>Trotsky Criticizes Stalin's Policies</h3>
<p>Says They Will Lead the Country to Collapse; Advocates Establishing a Soviet Democratic System</p>
<p>⊙Mexico City The Soviet opposition leader Trotsky recently sent a telegram to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, stating, "The policies pursued by Stalin will lead the Soviet Union to complete collapse both domestically and abroad. The only way to save the situation at this moment is to thoroughly change the policies pursued by Stalin, establish a Soviet democratic system, and publicly re-examine the recent Moscow cases. If so, I will do my best to assist you." (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Soviet Party Prison</h3>
<p>More Than 1,000 People Arrested in Belarus</p>
<p>[Moscow] Today's Minsk newspapers have been delivered here, reporting that a total of 1,170 people have been arrested in Belarus this time. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] It is claimed here that Zhilibas, the director of the Soviet Far East Political Police, has been dismissed and arrested. All of Yagoda's "five pillars of support in the political police" have been purged. According to Tai's biography, he was originally named Sabadni when he served as the director of the Ukrainian Political Police eight years ago. He later changed his name to the current name when he was transferred to the Far East. There was great shock here after the news of Tai's arrest was confirmed. (National Haitong Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Process of Uncovering the Red Army General's Treason Case</h3>
<p>Attributed to a Female Spy</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw According to reports here, the reason why the Tukachevsky case was uncovered was due to a woman named Voronsov. The woman, dressed in glamorous attire, had been in contact with Tukachevsky for a long time. With an intimate attitude, she finally discovered the conspiracy. As a result, after Tukachevsky was executed, the Soviet government immediately promoted the woman to deputy head of the anti-espionage agency. (National Haitong Telegram, 17th)</p>

<h3>Hirota Reports on Soviet Political Situation at Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] At the cabinet meeting on the 18th, Foreign Minister Hirota explained the situation of the Soviet internal strife as follows: "The truth about the recent events in the Soviet Union has not yet been fully ascertained, so it is not appropriate to make assertions. However, according to my observation, today's Soviet Union places its main emphasis on foreign expansion, and the officials who have been stationed abroad for a long time have unknowingly become fond of women, so those with stronger colors are gradually concentrated in the country. This is the same as during the French Revolution, when the nobles tried to start an uprising again after the revolution, wanting to restore Napoleon's regime, but the ending was still a failure. Stalin is extremely vigilant, fearing that a Napoleon will be found in the Soviet Union, so he executed Marshal Tukhachevsky, who was most likely to become a Napoleon, and performed a blood sacrifice. As for the interior of the Soviet Union, young people around the age of twenty are gradually filling their power, and the inherent position of the old revolutionaries is gradually being suppressed, all making sounds of dissatisfaction. This is the so-called conspiracy of the Trotskyites. The rumors are roughly like this. It is that the insurgents have won, so I think it is necessary to consider the situation of the Soviet Union's recent events." (Allied Telegram, 18th)</p>

Several batches of workers have already arrived in Vladivostok and will be transferred to the area. The Soviet people attach great importance to the port construction plan, because the port is an important port between the Soviet mainland and the Bering Strait. It is said that, in terms of transporting troops and munitions, the northern waterway is even more important than the Siberian Railway. (National Haitong Telegram, 18th)</p>

<h3>Pacific Pact Difficult to Realize in the Short Term</h3>
<p>Both England and Japan Hold a Cautious Attitude; Informal Negotiations are Underway</p>
<p>[London] According to today's news, the proposal of Australian Prime Minister Lyons to conclude a Pacific Pact is unlikely to be realized in the short term, no matter what. Although this proposal has received general sympathy, there are practical difficulties, such as the request of "Manchukuo" to participate in the treaty conference, and the attitude of the Soviet Union is not easy to eliminate. If we want such a meeting to have a chance of success, the initial contact will be delayed for a long time due to these difficulties. This is recognized by all those who are sincere. When the British Imperial Conference was in progress, Lyons discussed this matter with Guo Taiqi, the Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom, and Yoshida Shigeru, the Japanese envoy. The opinions of the Chinese in London on this matter seem to be inconsistent. It is believed that Japan and the British Dominions all hold a cautious attitude towards this proposal. It is heard that the informal procedures for the British-Japanese talks are progressing smoothly, but the date of the talks has not yet been determined.

<h3>Limit on Main Battleship Gun Caliber</h3>
<p>Japan Decides to Refuse Consideration; Formally Notifies the US Ambassador</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the US proposal to hold negotiations between the countries concerned to discuss limiting the caliber of main battleship guns to 14 inches, Japan has refused. Today, Foreign Minister Hirota notified the US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, of this decision. The Japanese government's decision is the result of consultations between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Navy. Observers have long known that Japan will never change its naval views, because the Japanese government believes that only qualitative restrictions, and no quantitative restrictions, can not achieve true naval disarmament. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Washington] The US government has inquired with the major naval powers whether they would agree to limit the caliber of battleship guns to 14 inches. Except for Japan, all have replied that they are willing to agree, but it must be followed by all countries. The US Navy Department plans to build two new battleships, which must now wait for Japan's statement of will before starting construction. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Washington] It was learned today that the United States has begun negotiations with major countries to limit the caliber of main battleship guns to 14 inches.

<h3>Soviet Union and Latvia Maintain Long-Standing Friendship</h3>
<p>Based on the Principles of Collective Security; Promote Close Cooperation Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet government issued a statement, which reads: "After Latvian Foreign Minister Munters came to Moscow, he held several talks with Chairman Molotov of the Council of People's Commissars and Foreign Commissar Litvinov. Regarding Soviet-Latvian relations, the general international situation, especially the security of Eastern Europe, after a friendly and open exchange of views, both sides agreed that the Soviet-Latvian relations, which have always been sincere and harmonious, will never be damaged, and there will be no differences of opinion. At the same time, it also confirmed that all the prerequisites for the effective development and strengthening of this friendship by both governments exist, especially on the major issues of international relations. The views of the Soviet Union and Latvia are completely the same, because both sides recognize that in the current international situation, it is necessary to unite all forces, and to consolidate world peace based on the principles of collective security and the League of Nations, and at the same time, to prepare to use all opportunities to cooperate favorably to achieve this goal. This is particularly beneficial to the relations between the two countries." (TASS dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>[Paris] The Finance Committee of the Senate met this afternoon to examine the bill of full financial power, which will take about one or two days to complete. Therefore, the Senate will be able to discuss this case at the earliest on the 19th. At the meeting of the Finance Committee today, Finance Minister Olivol attended to explain the details, but the content was not announced. As generally known, several members of the Finance Committee inquired about how the government intends to exercise its full powers over the supervision of banking and exchange businesses and the prevention of speculation. Olivol answered them. After the meeting, a press release was issued, stating that the Finance Committee has decided to ask Olivol to draft a clear provision on how to prevent tax evasion and speculation. Olivol issued a statement saying that if various measures to prevent speculation were publicly discussed, speculators would find ways to evade them once they heard the news, and various measures would be ineffective. The Finance Committee is now scheduled to continue its meeting at 3 p.m. tomorrow, and Prime Minister Blum will personally attend to give an explanation (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 17th).</p>
<h3>Former French President Doumergue Passed Away Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Paris] Former President Doumergue, a great statesman, passed away today in his hometown of Aigues-Vives, at the age of seventy-four. After graduating from the Faculty of Law at the University of Paris in his early years, he practiced law in Nîmes. From 1890 to 1893, he served as a judge in Vietnam and French Algeria in Africa. In the same year, he was elected as a member of parliament in the Gard province of his home country. From 1902 to 1905, he served as the Minister of Colonies. From 1905 to 1906, he served as the Vice President of the House of Representatives. He then successively served as the Minister of Commerce, Labor, and Education. In 1910, he was elected as a senator in the Gard province. In 1913, he came out to form a cabinet and served as a minister. He resigned in 1914. From 1914 to 1917, he served as the Minister of Colonies. In 1923, he was elected as the President of the Senate. In 1924, he was elected as the President of the Republic, serving until his term expired in 1931. In February 1934, after the conflict between the left and right wings in Paris due to the Stavisky scandal, the Daladier cabinet was forced to resign. The country was in turmoil. Doumergue responded to the requests of all parties and formed a cabinet of national unity, which was greatly expected. However, in November of the same year, he proposed a constitutional reform plan, which was opposed by the Radical Socialist Party, and he retired cleanly and enjoyed the tranquility of the mountains and forests, no longer interfering in political affairs, which has been more than two years now.

<h3>Steel Industry Labor Strike in the United States</h3>
<p>Government Mediates, Hoping for an Early Resolution</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the strike in the U.S. steel industry, it is hoped that it will be resolved soon because the government has organized a federal committee to mediate all aspects of the dispute. The committee members include Charles Taft, son of former President Taft, Galisen, director of the Labor Mediation Bureau, and MacGrady, Undersecretary of Labor. The strike in the U.S. steel industry broke out in Chicago on May 26, affecting as many as 100,000 workers. (Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Finance Strictly Restricts Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Preventing Capital Outflow, Taking Emergency Measures</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japan is now implementing the most stringent restrictions on capital outflows because the expansion of productivity requires a great deal of capital. Since the Exchange Control Law was amended in January of this year, capital exports have not been able to be carried out without the permission of the Ministry of Finance. In March and April of this year, Kurashiki Rayon Co., Ltd., Dai Nippon Spinning Co., Ltd., Kishiwada Spinning Co., Ltd., and Kureha Spinning Co., Ltd. purchased Chinese spinning mills in Tianjin and applied to the Ministry of Finance for the funds needed for export. The Ministry of Finance reserved the right to approve the application, fearing the escape of funds and further aggravating the inverse trend of the Japanese yen exchange rate. After repeated applications from the aforementioned companies, the Ministry of Finance agreed to the three points proposed by the companies, only allowing the export of the minimum amount of funds needed, and only to the extent absolutely necessary. Until recently, it was heard that the Ministry of Finance, in view of the increased need for domestic funds and the deterioration of Japan's international accounts, implemented stricter restrictions on capital exports. Even regarding the funds necessary for expanding Japanese industry in North China, the Ministry has decided to adopt a policy of not easily granting permission. It is said that there are two reasons for adopting this attitude: (1) The current situation in North China proves that economic cooperation with Japan cannot be actively carried out, so it is considered inappropriate to force it, or it may cause undesirable consequences. (2) In view of the deteriorating international accounts of Japan, it is currently necessary to prevent capital outflows as much as possible to avoid increasing concerns about the lack of domestic funds and the imbalance of international accounts. The above methods are of great concern because they are closely related to Japan's future economic activities in North China. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 18th)</p>

<p>⊙ Bilbao Front Line Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent: The Nationalist Army is besieging the city very urgently. The government army plans to make a last stand in the city, having placed landmines everywhere and set up obstacles in the streets in preparation for street fighting. After the outlying heights fell one after another, the government army occupied the strategically important Mount San Barnabo. The Nationalist Army has also begun to attack, but the government army is resisting strongly. It is rumored that the government army has withdrawn from the nearby town of Urdina. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>⊙ Bilbao: The Spanish Civil War is about to enter its twelfth month. Today, the largest battle in the history of the civil war took place.

Although the Nationalist Army used a large number of aircraft and tanks to assist in the battle, hundreds of people died in repeated attacks. At the same time, all Basque government ministers except three went to various parts of the Basque Country on official business. All powers are now known to be granted to the Defense Committee composed of the Minister of Justice (representing the Basque Nationalist Party), the Minister of Industry (Socialist Party), and the Minister of Public Works (Communist Party).

<p>⊙ Bilbao: The Nationalist Army broadcast a message saying that the villages and towns in the north, east, and south of the port of Bilbao, as well as the nearby mountains around the port that were regarded as natural barriers, have been captured by the Nationalist Army one after another. Therefore, the so-called "Iron Ring Defense Line" of the port no longer exists. Several places in the city are now on fire, and there is no responsible government in existence. Aircraft belonging to the Nationalist Army scattered leaflets over the port of Bilbao, advising residents to remain calm and wait for the Nationalist Army to enter the city.

<p>⊙ Bilbao: The troops belonging to the Nationalist Army and the Italian mercenary army "Black Arrow Division" continued to advance along the Nervión River yesterday morning, and immediately occupied the village of Tiegeto.

Until the afternoon, the Nationalist Army used heavy artillery and aircraft to start bombing Cape Bigostelucello. Later, at 6:30, the Nationalist Army finally captured Mount Aranzazu in a fierce attack. Therefore, among the high grounds outside the city of Bilbao, the government army only occupied the strategically important Mount San Barnabo. When the Nationalist Army climbed Mount Aranzazu, they rode on an aerial tramway. The government army had previously placed twelve machine guns in the gambling club in the mountain, and its shape was almost the same as a fortress. The Nationalist Army attacked repeatedly without success, so they used artillery and aircraft to bombard it fiercely until a three-engine aircraft dropped a giant bomb and razed the club to the ground. The Nationalist Army was then able to continue advancing straight to the mountain peak. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 18th)</p>

<h3>German Foreign Minister's Visit to England and Italy Expresses Concerns</h3>
<p>Fearing to Shake the Rome-Berlin Axis, Hoping to Restore Four-Power Cooperation</p>
<p>[London] News has recently been received from Rome that although Italian newspapers outwardly express approval of the German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to England, there are still some concerns. Italy is deeply concerned that Britain's insistence on ordering Germany to lift its restrictions on Spain and no longer provide assistance to the Spanish Nationalist Army will cause disagreements between Germany and Italy on the Spanish issue. Because the Spanish incident is related to Italy's prestige, it is difficult to give up halfway. As for the main issues in Europe, Italy is also afraid that the attitudes of Germany and Italy will be difficult to reconcile. In addition, when the Italian Ambassador to England, Grandi, met with Foreign Minister Eden yesterday, he told the Foreign Minister that Italy supports Neurath's visit to Britain for talks. This move will enable the four countries of Western Europe, England, France, Germany, and Italy, to conduct diplomatic talks again, and the purpose of the talks is to establish a system in which the four countries dominate European affairs. However, the British side frankly stated that it could not recognize this view. British diplomatic circles solemnly stated again tonight that any new Locarno Convention should only be regarded as the first step in establishing a general agreement, and the general agreement must include issues in Central and Eastern Europe, and the result must not weaken the friendship between England and France and the collective security system. Therefore, after Neurath comes to England, there will not be any immediate results, and the British government does not want to immediately restore the negotiations on the new West European Convention, because the solution of the West European issue is closely related to various important economic issues.

<h3>The Little Entente Strengthens Unity</h3>
<p>Abiding by Alliances to Maintain Territorial Security, Three Prime Ministers Issue Communiqué After Talks</p>
<p>⊙ Yugoslav Capital: The authorities of the Little Entente countries, namely Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović, Czech Prime Minister Hodža, Romanian Prime Minister Tătărescu, and Foreign Minister Antonescu, had a lengthy discussion on the Danube River yesterday and issued a communiqué afterwards stating that the authorities of the Little Entente countries, after discussing various political and economic issues in detail, have proven that their opinions are the same and are willing to strengthen the mutual relations between the three countries by adjusting the economy, developing cultural relations, and promoting international cooperation. The political goal of the three countries is still to maintain peace and maintain the security of the territory of the three countries within the scope of existing alliance treaties and good-neighborliness. Regarding the cooperation between the countries in the Danube River Basin, it was decided to continue to act in unison to promote its success. The Covenant of the League of Nations remains unwavering in its adherence by the Little Entente countries. Any amendment that cannot strengthen the principles of the Covenant will definitely not be accepted. In addition, it was decided to hold similar meetings in rotation in the three countries of the Czech Republic, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The unity, consolidation, and viability of the Little Entente have been confirmed in this meeting. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>⊙ South Country Capital: Prime Minister Stojadinović returned here today after talking with the Prime Ministers of Romania and the Czech Republic on a yacht on the Danube River yesterday. The initial impression gained by the general public is that the people of South Country still support the Little Entente. When the cruise ship was cruising on the river, the people on both sides of the river cheered and paid tribute to the authorities of the three countries. In the political circles of South Country, it is said that the united unity of the Little Entente countries, their adherence to the Covenant of the League of Nations, and various alliance treaties, and their respect for existing good-neighborliness and existing international obligations have all been reiterated. In addition, the authorities of the countries focused on the following issues during the talks: (1) The case of the high-ranking generals of the Soviet Red Army betraying the country and the possible impact on the European situation; (2) The issue of Hungary's rearmament. Regarding this level, the Little Entente countries are prepared to grant Hungary equal rights, but on the condition that the Hungarian government provides security guarantees. If Hungary unilaterally abolishes the military restriction clauses of the Treaty of Trianon, the Little Entente countries will immediately abolish the clauses in this treaty that are beneficial to Hungary; (3) The Czech Prime Minister's plan for economic cooperation between the countries in the Danube River Basin has been endorsed by the authorities of the Little Entente countries, and it is believed that the interests of all major countries (including Germany and Italy) should also be taken care of; (4) Regarding the German Foreign Minister's recent visit to South Country, Prime Minister Stojadinović explained the significance and role of this trip, and said that South Country's approach to Germany does not have any impact on the Little Entente.

<h3>Hydraulic Engineering of Dujiangyan</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>The Dujiangyan project doesn't stop there. After the Inner River and Outer River separate and flow a little downstream, you reach another major project, the Feishayan Weir. This weir is two meters high and also has a water-surging function. That is, if the Inner River's flow is excessive, any water exceeding two meters can overflow and return to the Outer River. However, this dam has always been extremely prone to collapsing, especially in April and May, precisely when rice seedlings need water. It is imperative to rush repairs, otherwise, the person in charge of the water conservancy project will at least be subject to detention.</p>
<p>In front of the Feishayan Weir, ancient people buried iron stakes. Each year when dredging, the iron stakes must be visible as the standard, and the weir is built two meters high to ensure sufficient water. Furthermore, each year, if the water overflowing the weir exceeds four meters, the Outer River basin will suffer flooding. There is also a small "Water-Scooping Dam" and a "Rolling Water Dam," both made by filling bamboo cages with stones, what is called a gabion, to force a moderate amount of water to flow into the "Baopingkou" (Bottle-Neck Entrance). The Baopingkou is carved from stone cliffs, with a water gauge placed beside it. Splashing waves fly like snow, striking the rocks with thunderous roars. Entering the Baopingkou is the "Lidui" (Separated Mound) carved by Li Bing, with a stone pillar standing alone and unfallen, called the Elephant Trunk Rock. Below the mound is a deep pool. Beside the rock is also coiled a large iron chain, said to be where the evil dragon was locked. The water势 flows down from the cliff, turning and impacting against the cut wall, pouring out from the Baopingkou at an extremely fierce rate, directly in front of the Lidui. Boats and rafts are very prone to danger. The rock chains may be for climbing.</p>
<p>In the past, the person managing the Dujiangyan project was called the Water Conservancy Magistrate. In the 25th year of the Republic (1936), it was renamed the Water Conservancy Bureau, with a provincial scope. Therefore, a Dujiangyan Water Conservancy Project Office was attached to exclusively manage the Dujiangyan project. The project is divided into major repairs and annual repairs. Major repairs should originally be done every three years, but after the founding of the Republic, it was only repaired once in the fourth year of the Republic (1915). From the year before last until this year, it was resolved to carry out a major repair with a budget of over 600,000 yuan, but in reality, fundraising has been difficult. Last year, only 140,000 yuan was used, and the project was barely completed. It is said that as long as the annual repairs are done well, the major repairs can be postponed for several more years.</p>
<p>Looking back north from the mountain rope bridge, in the lush and beautiful mountains and forests, there are several courtyards of temples and monasteries, layered and emerging among them. One large courtyard is called "Erlang Temple," which is dedicated to Erlang, who succeeded his father Li Bing in controlling the waters. On the stone tablet in front of the gate are engraved the key points of river management, saying, "Take advantage of the momentum to guide, adapt to the times." It also says, "Deeply dredge the滩, build the堰 low," a six-character principle for thousands of years. "Dig the river sand, build the embankment, build the fish mouth, set the sheep pen, erect the湃闕 (i.e., Feishayan), leave the leaking can (referring to opening holes in the bottom of the weir to release water), weave the cages densely, equip the stones sturdily, divide four and six, balance the drought and flood (flood: outer six, inner four; dry season: outer four, inner six, i.e., based on the amount of 榪槎 removed). Water painting symbols (referring to the water gauge), see the iron stakes (i.e., dredging must see the iron stakes). Diligently repair annually to prevent disasters, respect the old system, do not arbitrarily change." Beside it are also engraved the numbers "Cut fish at the bend, extract the heart on the right day." On the Lidui, there is another Li Bing Temple, and the temple appearances are all very solemn.</p>
<p>After the tour, we returned to Guanxian and then to Chengdu for some arrangements. Then we set off from Chengdu to Kunming. The Min River (i.e., Dujiang), surging from the northwest mountains, reaches Guanxian, just at the upper water inlet of the Chengdu Plain. From here downwards, it can directly flow for thousands of miles, flooding several counties. Before the Qin Dynasty, when the Dujiangyan was not built, human power could not control nature, and the floods of the Min River were very fierce. During the Qin Dynasty, Li Bing and his son, the prefects of Shu, built the Dujiangyan, benefiting fourteen counties. Therefore, after transplanting rice seedlings each year, the people of Shu slaughter sheep to worship and celebrate, with as many as 50,000 sheep.</p>
<p>The route to visit Dujiangyan is to exit the west gate of Guanxian, pass through Zhenyiguan and Fenghoulou. The sound of the river flowing is滔滔, growing louder as we walk. After crossing Zhangfeiyan, walking west along a shaded slope, we see the Anlan Rope Bridge spanning the river high in the sky. The bridge is made of ropes, which are made by twisting bamboo, thick as the mouth of a bowl, arranged in nine strands, and covered with wooden planks. From this shore, it pulls to the other shore, spanning three to four hundred steps. On both sides, bamboo ropes serve as railings to prevent danger. Below, there are several pillars, three to four丈 high, supporting the soft drooping tendency. Pedestrians walk across smoothly, with a slight sway. If several Yi people carrying charcoal come from the opposite direction, deliberately jumping and running, you will feel a violent bump. People in the past have already sung, "Wind flutters, rain sways, the river is a belt, the rainbow is a waist. I stand momentarily on the bridge, the heavenly ridge shakes, the water roars. Dizziness and blurred vision, heart and胆 split, the bridge does not shake itself, people shake themselves. Others tell me the magical诀, look east and west, the heart turns fearful." Indeed, it is like this. This bridge needs to have its bamboo ropes replaced once a year, costing over 10,000 yuan, which is quite a bit. However, if you want to build a stone bridge or an iron bridge, first, there is no way to raise millions of yuan. Second, the water is too rapid, and the衝力 is too great. Even if you could build it, you could not guarantee a few years of safety.</p>
<p>Standing in the middle of the bridge, looking along the river in both directions, the Dujiangyan project is laid out before your eyes. First, climb high to get a general view, then inspect closely to understand the structure of all the projects. Under the bridge, a flat, fish-back-shaped堤 is built to face the flow, called the "Dujiang Fish Mouth," also called the Renzi堤 or Jinzi堤 because it resembles the Chinese characters "人" and "金." The Fish Mouth divides the river water into two, the left flow is called the Outer River, which is the main flow of the Min River, and the right flow is called the Inner River, which is the source of the fourteen counties' water channels. During the Ming Dynasty, this 堤 was often washed away, so first an iron turtle weighing 18,000斤 was cast to鎮壓, but it was washed away the following year. Later, a two-bodied iron cow weighing 70,000斤 was built, but it was also washed away, showing the猛勇 of the water power and the difficulty of building this 堤. A major repair was carried out incompletely the year before last, and the new 堤 was built, costing 80,000 yuan.护脚笼 are placed beside the 堤. No one can guarantee how many years it will last. The "Dujiang Fish Mouth" has the "Baizhang堤" on the upstream left bank and the "Water-Scooping Dam" on the right, forcing the water to the mouth, and then dividing the flow inside and outside. Every year after the winter solstice, a kind of material called "榪槎" must be used to cut off the water and flow it into the Inner River in order to挑灘 and repair the embankments of the Outer River. Before the beginning of spring, the Outer River is opened and the Inner River is blocked in order to allow construction on the Inner River. The 榪槎 is made of tripod frames, placed one against the other in the river, and then "標籤," "花欄," "捶笆," "簟蓆," and "黃泥" are layered and stacked inside to form the Inner River 榪槎. The opening of the Qingming Festival is a grand ceremony. The Director of the Construction Department, the Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, and representatives from other high-ranking officials and counties all come to watch the ceremony on this day.</p>
<h3>Dispute over County Magistrate Qualification Examination in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>Wang Sichang and Others Accuse the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Illegal Conduct; Internal Supervision Department and Court Simultaneously Investigate</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Hubei Provincial Government held a county magistrate qualification examination last month. Generally, those with county magistrate qualifications were required to register and participate, totaling over 200 people, most of whom had served as county magistrates. After a physical examination, written test, and oral examination, 31 were selected. When the results were announced, public opinion was in uproar. Some people, including Wang Sichang, who had passed the Examination Yuan's review of the county magistrate examination, and over 50 others, including Zhou Jigeng, who had pre-secured a passing grade for county magistrate, jointly filed a complaint with the Control Yuan and the Ministry of Interior, accusing Meng Guangpeng, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, of examination fraud and dereliction of duty, requesting an investigation. Simultaneously, they formally filed a lawsuit with the Wuchang District Court. The Ministry of Interior has approved sending personnel to conduct a thorough investigation, while the Control Yuan has been tasked to the Lianghu Control Commissioner's Office, which sent a secretary to the Civil Affairs Department to review the files and collect evidence, appearing very busy. The court also attaches great importance to this case. However, considering that the county magistrate qualification examination is organized by a separate committee, the illegal conduct should not be blamed solely on the Director of the Civil Affairs Department. They intend to issue a decision not to prosecute. After the lawyers Yang Zehua and Li Deyi, hired by Wang Sichang and others, presented their reasons and requested a review, the prosecutor personally went to the Civil Affairs Department to review the files and conduct an on-site investigation, and will likely summon individuals for questioning within a few days. The reasons provided by the plaintiffs are roughly as follows: "The defendant, in charge of the county magistrate qualification examination, ㊀ did not base the results on the written test. For example, Chen and Cai, among others, scored only 30 to 35 points on the written test, yet their scores were secretly changed, allowing them to enter the passing list, while those who genuinely passed were rejected. ㊁ The results were not based on the oral examination. For example, Xiong and Yuan, among others, did not utter a single word, yet they were ranked at the top, while those who spoke fluently were not selected. ㊂ The results were not based on their performance in office. For example, Lu Shigugu, the former county magistrate of Baokang, was praised by the provincial government as the "most capable official in the province" after performance evaluations, and was explicitly commended. Wang Sichang was commended by Chairman Chiang with a telegram saying "loyal, courageous, and resolute" for his efforts in suppressing bandits, all with documented records. This time, they were rejected solely due to a three-minute oral examination. This shows that the examiners purely determined who to select based on the strength of the lobbyists." The plaintiffs' publicly stated reasons are briefly summarized here. This case is of great significance to the future of Hubei's officialdom. With the administrative, supervisory, and judicial aspects conducting thorough investigations, it is expected that there will be a fair resolution. (June 16th)</p>
<h3>Major Construction Projects in Gan: Water and Electricity</h3>
<p>Construction Costs 3 Million Yuan; Entire Project Nearing Completion</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Nanchang City has a population of 300,000. Municipal construction has made considerable progress in recent years. However, the city's water supply still comes from rivers and wells, which is inconvenient and unsanitary, especially for emergency fire prevention. The city government has specifically planned to establish a water and electricity plant. All capital, in addition to requesting an investment of 1.3 million yuan from the Construction Silver Company, will be raised by the province itself. Last year, after signing a contract with the company, water and electricity machinery, water pipes, and various materials were ordered from Jardine Matheson, costing 1.8 million yuan. The plant site is located on the east bank of the Gan River, north of the Zhengzheng Bridge. Construction began in February and is now largely complete, costing over 210,000 yuan. It is estimated that all expenses after completion will reach approximately 3 million yuan. The factory's equipment and water pipes in various roads and streets are being rushed to completion, and it is expected to be completed in about two days. The general situation of the two plants is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Power Plant</p>
<p>The city's existing power supply is insufficient. Therefore, a generator is being set up at the water plant, and its water pumping is utilized to make the water supply meet economic conditions. The boiler for the machine is a Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube type from the UK, with three units, each with a heating surface area of 2,960 square feet, a steam output of 14,200 pounds per hour, a steam pressure of 385 pounds per square inch, and a steam temperature of 770 degrees Fahrenheit. The steam turbine generator is a product of the British Electric Company, gear-driven, with one unit of 1,100 kW, a speed of 7,000 revolutions per minute, and one unit of 2,100 kW, a speed of 6,000 revolutions per minute. The steam pressure and temperature are the same as the boiler. The voltage is 2,300 volts, the frequency is 50, and it can generate 3,000 kilowatts. Two-thirds are used by users, and one-third by factories. If factories develop in the future, it can be expanded at any time.</p>
<p>Water Plant</p>
<p>The water source is taken from the Gan River. Two centrifugal pump with motors are used to pump the water to a mixing pool. After continuous water flow, the solid matter in the water gradually settles down, flowing to the alum pool. After the alum is mixed with water, it is put into a coagulation sedimentation pool. After a considerable amount of time, a chemical reaction occurs, the渣滓 settles to the bottom of the pool, and the clear water is then quickly sand-filtered to make it clear. The filtered water is then disinfected and sterilized with chlorine and ammonia, and then four centrifugal pumps, driven by three-phase induction motors, are used to send it to the factory, with an output of 370 cubic meters per hour, and to the water tower in the city center, from where water pipes run to various users. All users are equipped with water meters, and the water price is 2 jiao 4 fen per degree. In the future, each household will need to pay a deposit for the water meter, a water absorption fee, and water pipe installation fees, which will cost dozens of yuan. Given the current economic capacity of the citizens of Nanchang, it may be difficult to make it widespread.</p>
<h3>Baoshan</h3>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Gambling in Various Townships</p>

<p>Served for Six Years, Truly Able to Abide by the Law; Continues the Past Spirit to Seek Local Welfare</p>
<p>He Dequi, the Public Works Department Council Member of the Shanghai International Settlement, has been promoted to Deputy General Manager. The Board of Directors has approved and formally announced it. Also promoted at the same time was Hibiki Hidehiko, the Japanese Council Member. Here is a brief biography and conversation with He Dequi.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of He Dequi</p>
<p>Mr. He is from Jinhua, Zhejiang Province, 42 years old, a Bachelor from the University of Wisconsin, USA, and a Master from Harvard University. He has served as a professor at Shanghai Guanghua, Jiaotong, Datong, and other universities, as a specialist member of the Capital Construction Committee, and as the English secretary of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement. In the summer of 1931, he was appointed Council Member of the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, abided by the law, maintained integrity, and worked diligently for the public. The Chinese and foreign directors relied on him deeply. He was particularly devoted to the education of Chinese people within the settlement, such as increasing the number of bureau-established schools and expanding subsidies for Chinese private schools, which were effective. (Currently, the number of students in the bureau-established schools within the settlement has increased from 3,000 to over 10,000.) He has also made many contributions to improving the welfare of Chinese people within the settlement. He was particularly considerate to poor citizens within the settlement, such as peddlers and棚戶. Recently, due to his outstanding performance, he was promoted to the position of Deputy General Manager.</p>
<p>Mr. He's Remarks</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. He at the Public Works Department yesterday afternoon. According to his statement, Dequi has been working in the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement for six years. He is grateful for the guidance of the Chairman and General Manager of the Board of Directors, the cooperation of the Shanghai Municipal Government and foreign colleagues, and the care of people from all walks of life. Fortunately, there have been no shortcomings. As Deputy General Manager of the Public Works Department, he will continue to work hard in the past spirit to seek the welfare of the local area and hope that people from all walks of life, Chinese and foreign, will provide guidance from time to time to correct his shortcomings. According to the usual practice, the Public Works Department is granted three weeks of leave each year. Dequi has used this time in past years to visit Sichuan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Shanxi, Shandong, and other provinces to inspect and deeply understand that under the guidance of the central government, all major aspects of politics, economy, education, and transportation in various provinces are making rapid progress. Since Chairman Chiang promoted peaceful unification, there has been even greater progress. With such unity of spirit and renovation of all policies, the rejuvenation of China can be assured, and the prosperity of Shanghai will also increase accordingly. This is especially fortunate for Dequi.</p>

<h3>Envoy to Denmark Wu Nanru Departed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Brief Stop in Moscow Before Proceeding to Denmark; No Change in Sino-Danish Diplomatic Relations</p>
<p>Wu Nanru, the envoy to Denmark, who had requested leave to return to China to report on his duties, has now completed his leave and departed last night aboard the Northern Steamer of the Hongyun Shipping Bureau, heading to his post via the Soviet Union. Mr. Wu made a statement before his departure, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Sailing Last Night</p>
<p>Mr. Wu, accompanied by his wife and the newly appointed embassy staff member Wu Junyuan, departed from the Jianghai Customs Wharf at 4:30 PM, taking a company launch to board the ship. Zhou Jue, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Tang Shixuan, secretary of the City Government, Lull, the Danish Consul-General in Shanghai, Mei Lanfang, the famous performer, and Mr. Wu's relatives and friends, all went to the wharf to see him off. Leaders of various organizations and groups also presented flower baskets to wish him well. The ship set sail from the Longmao Wharf in Pudong at 6:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<p>Remarks Before Departure</p>
<p>Mr. Wu, before his departure, made a statement, saying that since returning to China on March 30, he has been here for two and a half months. During that time, he had been to Beijing, Hangzhou, Lushan, and his ancestral home in Yixing. He originally intended to go to North China, but he did not have enough time. In all the places he visited, he felt that the people's thinking and local construction had made considerable progress compared to a few years ago. He was very excited by what he saw. This phenomenon is a good sign of national rejuvenation. Therefore, he hopes that the people will continue to work hard and persevere. The country's position will surely be enhanced in a few years. He will go to his post in Denmark via the Soviet Union. He plans to stay in Moscow for a short time to retrieve his luggage left there and to visit Ambassador Jiang Tingfu. However, he has no mission. He expects to arrive in Copenhagen around the 8th or 9th of next month.</p>
<p>Sino-Danish Relations</p>
<p>As for the diplomatic relations between China and Denmark, there is no change because the two countries have always had friendly relations. The trade agreement was signed in 1886 and does not need to be revised. As for the relations between China and the Soviet Union, the two countries' diplomacy is also very ordinary. The so-called Sino-Soviet non-aggression pact is just speculation because there is no need to sign such a pact between the two countries. As for the situation of the Soviet Union's purge, it seems very serious. The news is very complicated, but the facts may not be as bad as reported.</p>
<h3>Commander Yang Received Dutch Consul-General Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Lu Hanqin to Preside Over Launching Ceremony of Jinjiang Steamer</h3>
<p>To Be Held at 1 PM on the 26th</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's newly built Shanhe-class steamer "Jinjiang" is scheduled to officially hold its launching ceremony at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 26th. The company's telegraph department requested that the Ministry send personnel to Shanghai to preside over the ceremony.

The company has already begun preparations yesterday.</p>
<h3>Hearing on the Case of the Haili Steamer Hitting a Reef Began Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ordered the Shipowner to Submit a Supplementary Written Report to the Ministry; Rumors of Haiheng's Disappearance Originated from Hong Kong</p>
<p>The hearing on the case of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's state-owned Haili steamer hitting a reef was organized by Cai Zengji, General Manager of the company, Deputy Manager Shen Zhongyi, Chen Zhaoji, Director of the Shipping Department, Deputy Director Zhou Houkun, Zeng Guangqing, Director of the Business Department, Feng Feng, Chief of the Maritime Affairs Section, and others at 10:00 AM yesterday. Cai served as the chairman. The captain of the Haili, Teng Shibiao, and the first, second, and third mates of the ship were summoned to the company to inquire about the circumstances of the incident and what happened on the spot. The captain Teng gave a detailed account of the facts on the spot and what was recorded in the logbook (the same as the account of the incident published in this newspaper yesterday). Next, the third mate on duty reported, and his statement was similar to that of the captain. Then, Cai, Shen, and others questioned them one by one and ordered the captain to submit a supplementary written report to be forwarded to the Ministry for instructions. According to the service personnel on the ship, after the Haili set sail, there was a passenger in compartment No. 20 who brought a dancing girl. After the ship set sail, the passenger made trouble in the dancing girl's room. The service personnel tried to dissuade him, but the passenger became angry. Unexpectedly, when he arrived in Shanghai, he blamed the incident with the dancing girl on the crew. Furthermore, for the past two days, there have been rumors in this port that the Haiheng has disappeared again, causing panic. The company has certified that this is completely unfounded. The ship is currently sailing from Little Luzon. It is said that this rumor originated in Hong Kong and seems to have been spread by someone to confuse the public. The Haili is scheduled to enter the Dongjiadu Old Shipyard for repairs at 10:00 AM today.</p>

<h3>Japanese Consulate Police Arrest Japanese Communist Party Cadre</h3>
<p>Using Alias Gan to Come to Shanghai; Contacting Korean Independence Party Activities</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News, the police of the Consulate General discovered that someone had recently started secret activities. Someone using the alias Gan had sneaked into Shanghai as a cadre to rebuild the Japanese Communist Party. After the Consulate authorities received a designated search warrant from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, they immediately transferred it to the relevant authorities and deployed a serious search network throughout the city. Because Gan could not be active in Japan, he sneaked into Shanghai and was reportedly in contact with the Korean Independence Party in Shanghai and Nanjing.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Expresses Views on Demands by Marine Engineers for Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>Currently Studying in Detail and Submitting to the Ministry for Approval; Employees Should Serve Peacefully and Await Resolution</p>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently received a letter from the China Marine Engineers' Joint Association, in which all marine engineers on the company's ships demanded improved treatment. The company is discussing the issue of salary increases for personnel in the driving, engineering, communications, and navigation departments and has requested the Ministry for approval. Many marine engineers are reasonable and should serve peacefully and await resolution. A letter to marine engineers was specially issued yesterday, and a reporter from the New News Agency has excerpted it as follows:</p>
<p>Obey Orders and Sacrifice Personal Views</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a state-owned shipping organization directly under the Ministry of Communications. All employees directly serve the company, which means serving the country and should be subject to government decrees. If there is any conflict with government decrees, it should be absolutely sacrificed. Marine engineers hold important positions on ships and cannot focus on personal interests while disregarding the interests of the state's business. Employees are members of the public, and serving in state-owned organizations is also being an owner of the company, sharing responsibility with the managers. The managers represent the government in implementing decrees. The marine engineers, as employees and owners, should not only obey the government decrees implemented by the company and do their best to maintain them, but also have the responsibility to supervise whether those above are doing their best to implement them and whether those below are obeying orders.</p>
<p>Improper Behavior May Not Be Beneficial</p>
<p>Since the company began a thorough rectification of its affairs in the spring of last year, it has been more than ten months. During this time, the accumulated malpractices of the ships have been eliminated, and the cooperation of the crew has been seen. Most of the marine engineers are also the backbone of supporting the government and promoting the rectification plan, but there are also some with wrong ideas and flawed actions. For example, some crew members of the Haiheng used coercion overseas to demand higher treatment, and the main elements were the marine engineers. Recently, more than a dozen marine engineers resigned themselves to demand higher treatment, which has been disapproved by the company. All such behaviors are inappropriate and should not have been done by marine engineers who share weal and woe. The company has been observing the unreasonable actions of the marine engineers and may be due to incitement by others. However, the intentions of those who incite are not only to destroy the state's transportation business, but also may not be beneficial to the marine engineers themselves. The marine engineers should think deeply about it.</p>
<p>Salary Focuses on Knowledge and Experience</p>
<p>Since the reorganization of the company, we have been proceeding with the development of business and the improvement of personnel management. The issue of crew treatment has never had special regulations. We have also drafted the regulations on the treatment of driving, engineering, communications, and navigation personnel, taking into account the Maritime Law and the actual situation of the company, and submitted them to the Ministry for approval. These regulations have been revised separately for salary grades, rewards and punishments, advancement, retirement, and pensions. Special attention has been paid to the crew's knowledge and experience and their service performance. Before the approval and implementation, the company has appropriately increased the treatment of some captains, and is also preparing to give reasonable salary increases to other driving, engineering, communications, and navigation personnel. The salaries of the marine engineers are slightly lower than those of the driving personnel, but there are special reasons for this: ㊀ Throughout history, most of the marine engineers serving on ships, except for a few who graduated from specialized schools, have been promoted from craftsmen. ㊁ Those promoted from craftsmen have considerable experience and superior work efficiency, but lack theoretical knowledge of mechanical operation. ㊂ Those who graduated from schools have good knowledge, but mostly focus on theory and lack experience. They are also not accustomed to operation, which affects work efficiency. Therefore, the treatment they enjoy has to be slightly lower than other technical personnel. However, according to the company's current treatment, it is better than other shipping companies. The marine engineers should examine themselves and not be sacrificed by external temptations.</p>
<p>Request All Points to Ministry for Approval</p>
<p>The company's responsibility is to implement government orders and cannot neglect respecting national discipline and maintaining the company's business. All employee petitions that do not hinder discipline and business can be considered and accepted. Otherwise, no matter what the sacrifice, we will not hesitate. The marine engineers have now submitted five requests to the company through the China Marine Engineers' Joint Association. The company will study these requests based on the above-mentioned principles and the actual situation, and will also report the situation to the Ministry of Communications for approval. However, the company deeply feels that this request exceeds the current salary by more than 40%, which is not within the company's financial capacity to bear. Foreign merchants account for 70% of the domestic ship tonnage, while the domestic only account for 30%. If domestic ships increase costs too much by raising treatment, they will lose their competitive effectiveness, which is not a blessing for the country. Furthermore, in terms of the principle of improving the treatment of marine engineers, those who are not from specialized schools but have mechanical knowledge can be treated the same as those from schools with experience. At the same time, personnel from specialized schools must have considerable experience to enjoy the highest possible treatment. Among the above two types of personnel, if knowledge and experience are not both available, this highest treatment cannot be given.</p>
<h3>City Joint Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council Urging Speedy Construction of Public Housing</h3>
<p>To Accommodate Demolished Shantytown Residents</p>
<p>The City Joint Association of the First Special District sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you directly. The association previously suggested that your council build public housing to accommodate the demolished shantytown residents and the general public, fearing that the shantytown residents would be displaced from now on, as your council planned to demolish the shantytowns in stages. Now, the phased demolition of shantytowns has been implemented, and at the same time, there is a proposal to order the demolition of attics built by residents within the boundary, which further highlights the need to plan for the construction of public housing as soon as possible. Therefore, we are writing to urge you to pay attention to the difficulties of the public in living and design and build public housing as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Liu Ruiheng Came to Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss Eradicating Plague in Fujian</h3>
<p>Fujian Epidemic Prevention Society to Host Today; Liu to Report on Epidemic Prevention Plan</p>
<p>Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Central Health Administration, drafted a five-year plague eradication plan after conducting an on-site inspection of the epidemic areas in Leqing and other places in Fujian. To gather collective wisdom, he sought opinions from the Shanghai Plague Prevention Association. The plan has recently been drafted. To discuss how to implement the plan, he took the Beijing-American express train from Beijing to Shanghai yesterday afternoon and arrived at 8:00 PM. The Shanghai Health Bureau has notified the Fujian Plague Prevention Committee to send representatives to discuss the matter together. The committee decided to send Xiao Bichuan, Huang Jianzhong, and Wang Pingnan as representatives to visit Mr. Liu at his hotel this morning for specific discussions. It was also decided to host Mr. Liu tonight at the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, inviting all members of the community to attend and listen to Mr. Liu's public announcement of the five-year plan.</p>
<h3>Douglas Jumbo Jet Shipped from U.S. to Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>To develop its business, China National Aviation Corporation ordered two Douglas jumbo jets from the United States last year. It was learned yesterday that one of the aircraft was shipped to Shanghai on the CladFrek freighter of the American Trading Company at 11:30 AM yesterday. The ship docked at the Huangpu Wharf. The aircraft is the same as the company's current twin-engine Douglas, with an original capacity of 18 passengers. To make passengers more comfortable, it has been converted to 14, making the interior wider than before for ease of movement. The aircraft can reach a speed of over 200 kilometers per hour. The company is currently going through customs and other procedures to extract the aircraft so it can be transported to Longhua Airport for installation. Once installed, it will be added to the Shanghai-Ping or Shanghai-Chuan routes.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ping Long-Distance Telephone Added Booster Phone Trial</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Ping Tianjin long-distance telephone, sponsored by the Ministry of Communications, has been tested several times since its completion, but the results have been poor. This morning, personnel from the Shanghai Telephone Bureau told the Hua Dong News Agency that the Shanghai-Ping telephone was used with a "booster" last night to re-test the speech, as the sound was not clear in previous tests. The result was much better than before. The date of the call will be determined by the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<h3>Vice President Kong Concerned About Relief for Disaster-Stricken Children</h3>
<p>Children's Relief Association Implements Relief Plan</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since last autumn, the provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Henan have not had a single drop of rain. The people are struggling to survive, the fields are cracked, there is no green grass in the wilderness, and there are wails everywhere. All resources have been exhausted, and grass roots and tree bark have become treasures. Holy soil and wild corpses are used as food. The miserable and tragic situation is truly like a hell on earth. The children in the disaster areas, known as the second generation of the nation, can't escape the disaster and die with the adults. This is not only a human tragedy but also a major misfortune for the country and society. The China Children's Relief Association, responsible for children's relief, has drafted a concrete plan to relieve the disaster-stricken children, planning to establish 15 disaster-stricken children's shelters in the disaster areas of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Henan, with an annual cost of over 100,000 yuan to seek thorough and complete relief. The association will telegraph Vice President Kong, who is traveling in Europe, to raise huge sums to implement the association's plan to relieve the disaster-stricken children. The association has received Vice President Kong's telephone approval to proceed with the proposal. Therefore, the China Children's Relief Association immediately appointed Deputy Secretary-General Chen Tiesheng to fly to the disaster areas on the 16th to carry out the work of relieving the disaster-stricken children. Before Mr. Chen's departure, he received a telegram from Vice President Kong, urging him to report the disaster situation in detail at any time and continue to assist in the implementation.</p>

The objectives of the inspection are: (1) to introduce national rice to the inspected areas, so that consumers have a deeper understanding and impression of national rice; (2) to understand the needs of the inspected areas for rice and the conditions of these needs; (3) to research and explore ways and methods to improve the transportation and sales of national rice in the inspected areas.</p>
<h3>National Trade Bureau Notifies Merchants to Directly Order Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>Taking a 30% Profit in One Transaction</p>
<p>The National Trade Bureau, upon receiving a dispatch from the Ministry of Industry in response to a consultation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on a report from our country's Consul in Hamburg, Germany, stated: "The cargo stipulated in the bills of lading signed by this Consulate include German goods produced in Germany, goods from other countries exported through Germany, and goods from other countries not exported through Germany, but transshipped to China en route. The third type of goods is mostly ordered by our country's import merchants from Germany, and German merchants then purchase them from manufacturers in other countries to meet the needs of our country's import merchants. An investigation reveals that the profits taken in this one transaction often exceed 30% of the manufacturer's original selling price. If our country's import merchants could order directly from the manufacturers, the purchase price could be reduced by more than 30% of the manufacturer's original selling price. Statistics show that the annual amount of goods purchased through German merchants is very large. If direct orders could be placed with the manufacturers, it would undoubtedly benefit the country's import merchants. Therefore, we request that the Ministry of Industry be consulted to issue an order to our country's import merchants to find ways to order directly from the manufacturers, in order to benefit commerce." After receiving the order, the National Trade Bureau specifically notified all merchants across the country yesterday to take note that when purchasing raw materials or semi-finished products from foreign manufacturers, they should order directly from the producers to avoid inflated prices due to intermediaries and to ensure that the goods purchased are actually produced in that country.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Operated Pudong Water Plant Begins Supplying Water Today</h3>
<p>Design and Construction Took Two Years</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government has been continuously striving for various construction projects in the urban area in recent years and has made significant progress. It has paid particular attention to the plan to prosper Pudong, such as building roads and expanding ferry lines, which have made the Pudong market present a thriving scene. Therefore, the daily necessities of Pudong's current land and water transportation, electricity, and telephones have generally been available. The only shortcoming is the lack of tap water facilities. The Municipal Government, in view of this, ordered the Xingye Trust to actively prepare for it. After receiving the order, the company worked hard to carry out a meticulous plan. It took two years, and it has now been fully completed and is scheduled to officially supply water today (the 19th). A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special trip to visit yesterday. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>General Information about the Facilities</p>
<p>The Pudong Water Plant is located on Youlong Road in Pudong, approximately across the river from Avenue Edward VII, and is located in the center of the most prosperous area of Pudong. The plant base occupies a very large area. The pump room is located at the entrance of Youlong Road. The water level there is very deep, making it the most suitable water source in Pudong. All the buildings inside the factory are of the latest design. In addition to the above-mentioned water intake pump room, there is a sedimentation tank, a rapid filtration tank, a clear water tank, and a clear water pump room, all of which are steel-reinforced concrete structures and have been treated to prevent leakage. The clear water tank is sealed with steel-reinforced concrete and Sando soil, and is equipped with fifteen vent pipes to ensure that the water quality remains absolutely clean. There is also a water tank dedicated to washing the rapid filtration tank. The alum feeders, chlorine feeders, and various chemical testing instruments are also all of the latest type. The chemical testing equipment is particularly complete and novel. The office is also quite spacious and clean. The machines used in the factory are all powered by electricity, making them highly efficient and easy to manage. There are two mixed water motor pumps in the water intake room. When taking water, there is first a fish-eye steel mesh to prevent the inflow of fish, and then a copper wire mesh to prevent the absorption of coarse sand. There are two clear water motor pumps in the water outlet room. It is also heard that the factory has now added a chlorine gas machine to the clear water room to ensure complete safety. In total, the Trust has invested approximately 800,000 yuan in national currency in various construction facilities.</p>
<p>Water Production and Testing</p>
<p>The mixed water sucked in by the water intake room is added with an appropriate amount of dissolved alum water in the alum addition room by mechanical force and then sent to the sedimentation tank. The sedimentation tank has separate compartments with cement boards to block the smooth flow of water, so that the mixed water with added alum can gradually settle down after undergoing a winding path. When it reaches the rapid filtration tank, the water quality is as clear as a mirror. After being filtered by sand, it gathers in the clear water tank and is disinfected and sterilized by adding chlorine gas using a chlorine gas machine before being output by the clear water pump room. The factory spares no expense in purchasing the latest and most accurate instruments for water quality testing and hires specialized technicians to specialize in water quality testing. Every day, the mixed water from the Huangpu River is first tested to know the amount of sand, mud, and bacteria contained in the water, so as to determine the amount of alum to be added. The mixed water is tested again after sedimentation and sand filtration to determine the various components contained in the water and then re-tested to determine the amount of disinfectant. After disinfection, a bacterial examination is performed again to prove whether the disinfectant is appropriate. Before the official water supply this time, in addition to the factory's chemical testing engineers testing the water quality themselves every day, water samples are also sent to the Health Testing Institute of the Health Bureau for testing every day. They have now fully passed the test. The water pipes on each road are flushed day and night with disinfected clean water. After the chief of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, Bureau Chief Xu, specially sent the responsible section chief, Section Chief Zou, to the factory to inspect each part in detail and pass the test, he approved the water supply. Because the factory is city-run, the water quality must be absolutely clean in order to protect the health of the citizens, so it must be extra cautious.</p>
<p>Water Supply Area</p>
<p>The water supply area of the factory is currently tentatively set from Tangqiao in the south to Qichangzhan in the north. It is heard that the second step is to extend to Bailianjing in the south and Yangjing Town in the north, which is expected to be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>A Corner of the Pudong Tap Water Plant's Water Tank</h3>
<h3>Public Concession Bans American Film</h3>
<p>Film Title "Shanghai March of Time"; Claim that the Film Contains Anti-Japanese Sentiment</p>
<p>The new film "Shanghai March of Time" of the American R.K.O. film company has been reviewed and approved by the Central Film Censorship Board and is scheduled to be screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater next Sunday. However, the company's representative in China suddenly received a notice from the Public Concession Police Department yesterday, stopping the screening. The reason for the ban is that the film contains anti-Japanese sentiment. It is heard that the Public Concession Film Censorship Board reviewed the film again at 3:00 PM yesterday, but the results have not been announced. According to Mr. Brighton, the director of the company in China, "The content of the film involves Japanese people" has been completely deleted. However, the police department insists on deleting the narration of the film, because the narration clearly has anti-Japanese sentiment, etc. Mr. Brighton (as he calls himself) believes that if the narration in the film is deleted, the spirit of the entire film will be lost, so he did not agree to do so. The most strange thing is that the Japanese film "New Earth" was recently ordered to stop screening, but the police department actually sent police to protect it and continue screening it. Only for American films are they repeatedly making things difficult, "which is really incomprehensible," he said. According to reports, the film depicts the situation in Shanghai quite faithfully. In addition, there are faithful descriptions of our country's construction and the spirit of the army, etc.</p>
<h3>Dispute Between Old and New Workers at Huafeng Flour Mill</h3>
<p>New Workers Were Heavily Armed, As If Facing a Formidable Enemy; Detectives Went to Suppress the Situation and Arrested Several People for Interrogation</p>
<p>The Huafeng Heji Flour Mill on Yaoshui Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, dismissed all workers after the last work stoppage. Recently, the factory needed to resume work, so Rong Binggen from Wuxi was appointed as the general foreman, and Wang Tingsheng from Anhui was appointed as the deputy foreman to recruit new workers. On the 16th of this month, they planned to enter the factory to start work. Unexpectedly, a group of old workers found out and went to the factory to make things difficult for the new workers. Although the factory tried to stop them, it was not only ineffective, but also led to disputes, followed by violence. As a result, factory staff and general foreman Rong Binggen, etc., were all injured. At that time, the Caojiadu Police Station, which was in charge, dispatched police to suppress the situation and arrested eight workers who were causing trouble, taking them to the station for investigation. However, the new workers were deeply afraid of being bullied by the old workers again. For self-defense, when they went to work at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, Deputy Foreman Wang Tingsheng led hundreds of workers, each holding weapons such as iron bars, long guns, steel forks, and shoulder poles, gathering in the open space on Xiaoshadu Road and Macau Road, ready to resist if the old workers made things difficult. Unexpectedly, the Putuo Road Detective Station found out about it and was deeply afraid that the situation would escalate and lead to unfortunate incidents. Therefore, they immediately ordered Chinese Detective Zhao Bingkun, West Third Road No. 12, to supervise a large number of reserve team members to suppress the situation and ordered all workers to put down their weapons. The leader, Wang Tingsheng, was arrested. However, two other workers, Fang Houxian and Fan Shaoquan, expressed dissatisfaction and had a strong attitude, so they were also arrested. The rest of the workers dispersed. One long gun, two broadswords, one axe, two steel tridents, one iron bar, and 122 shoulder poles were seized and taken to the detective station for safekeeping. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Detective Station Lawyer Li Zhishan filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 150 of the Criminal Law on the crime of disturbing order, and stated the facts of the case. According to the West Police No. 12's complaint about the situation at the time of the arrest, the defendants claimed that the workers brought these weapons for self-defense and there was no violence or coercion. Lawyers Fan Gang and Gu Yongquan were also hired to defend them. Judge Chuan Lin verified the confessions and sentenced Wang Tingsheng to two months in prison for openly gathering a crowd with the intention of violence or coercion. If execution is difficult, the sentence can be commuted to a fine at the rate of one yuan per day. Fang Houxian and Fan Shaoquan, who assisted in the scene, were each fined ten yuan. If they are required to serve a labor sentence, the rate is one yuan per day. The weapons were confiscated. During the appeal period, Wang paid a bail of sixty yuan, and Fang and Fan each submitted a bail of ten yuan to be released.</p>
<h3>Elderly Woman Hit by Bicycle Dies of Illness After Examination</h3>
<p>At about 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, at the intersection of Jiaotong Road and Gonghexin Road in Zhabei, an elderly woman, Yao Zhang, 79 years old, was walking through the area when Gu Asan passed by on a bicycle, causing the elderly woman to injure her arm. Yesterday, the elderly woman suddenly died at home at No. 22 Zhonghefang, Jingjiang Road. Bao Zhang reported to the Xinzha Branch Bureau and local constable Shen Xiaowu, who reported to the Shanghai Local Court for examination. At 5:00 PM, Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang was dispatched to clarify that Yao Zhang died of illness. In addition, an unidentified male corpse, about 30 years old, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, was found dead in Deshunli, Changan Road. Prosecutor Jiang also clarified that he died of illness. Because there was no family to issue a certificate for burial, local constable Shen Xiaowu prepared a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Infectious Diseases in Shanghai Port Last Week</h3>
<p>There Were Eighty-Six Cases; Fourteen Deaths</p>

<h3>Re-arrested Suspects in the Case of the Bodyguard Squad Leader's Tragic Death for Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>As Many As Eight People, Including Gong Yifei, etc.; The Deceased's Fiancee Was Also Among Them</p>
<p>Lu Hongde, who lived in Gong's Residence No. 13, Lincoln Road, and served as the squad leader of the Second Squad of the Pusan District Bodyguard Corps, committed suicide with a rifle in bed at 2:00 PM on March 23rd. He died on the way to the hospital. The local court dispatched a prosecutor to examine the body. As a result, it was determined that there were signs of murder. However, the deceased's parents were both deceased. Only his grandmother, Lu Chen, his eldest brother, Lu Hongkang, his second brother, Lu Dadi, his eldest and second sisters-in-law, and the deceased's fiancee, Lu Ruzhu, who had been raised in the family since childhood, were not yet married. Therefore, the prosecutor initially summoned seven people, including Gong Yifei, the inspection director of the Bodyguard Corps, platoon leader Cai Hegen, the deceased's eldest and second brothers and sisters-in-law, and his fiancee Lu Ruzhu, to the court for interrogation. Everyone confessed that the deceased committed suicide. Gong Yifei provided a guarantee, and they were all released together. After the prosecutor conducted a detailed investigation, Lu Hongde was indeed murdered. Therefore, he re-summoned and detained the seven people, including Gong Yifei, and stopped their visits. The prosecutor's office believed that the deceased's eldest brother, Lu Hongkang, the deceased's fiancee, Lu Ruzhu, and the tenant Zhao Yingou were more suspicious and sent them to the City Police Bureau's Detective Team for strict interrogation. They then transferred the suspects Lu Shulin, Lu Chen, Lu A-mei, Lu A-ya, Zhao Wei, Lu Quansheng, Lu Yongsheng, Lu Wenan, and Lu A-lin, etc., to the court after the Detective Team led them for strict interrogation. The prosecutor interrogated them separately. As a result, except for Lu Shulin, Lu Chen, Lu A-mei, Lu Yongsheng, Zhao Yingou, Lu A-ya, and Zhao Wei, who were released, Gong Yifei, Cai Hegen, Lu Dadi and his wife, and Lu Ruzhu, Lu Quansheng, and Lu Wenan, etc., a total of eight people, were detained for thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Sun Shaoqing's Appeal Judgment</h3>
<p>The Five-Year Prison Sentence Remained Unchanged; The Ratio for Commuting to Labor Service Was Slightly Changed</p>
<p>Sun Shaoqing from Tongzhou, because he had been soliciting lawsuits in recent years and using intimidation to make people hand over property, making a profit of up to 100,000 yuan, was reported by someone. Lu Liankui, the Chinese Chief Inspector of the Public Concession, and Detective Liu Shaokui arrested Sun and sent him to the First Special Court. After interrogation by Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, Sun was sentenced to five years in prison, a fine of 1,000 yuan, and deprivation of public rights for ten years. His wife, Sun Zhu, was also sentenced to one year in prison at the same time for committing perjury. Sun and his wife were not satisfied with the judgment and filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. The interrogation has been completed, and the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the scheduled date for the verdict. Mr. Gan Jingxian, a lawyer from the Bureau of Works, also attended the court. Later, Presiding Judge Yu Hua, accompanied by Judges Peng and Xiao, took the bench in the First Criminal Court and announced the verdict. The original judgment regarding the part of the fine to be commuted to labor service was revoked. The amount of the fine to be commuted to labor service for Sun Shaoqing was determined by a ratio of 1,000 yuan to six months.</p>

<h3>Arrest and Sentencing of Heroin User to Twelve Years</h3>
<p>Tang Wanzhong from Yangzhou, at 10:20 AM on the day before yesterday, was found lying on a straw mat at No. 808, East West Huade Road, using the drug heroin to satisfy his addiction instead of opium.

<h3>Robbery of Central Automobile Company Vehicle Yesterday</h3>
<p>Stolen in Xinmin Village, Zhongshan Road; Found in Tonghe Li, Hutai Road</p>
<p>At 6:20 AM yesterday, a man suddenly went to the Central Automobile Company at No. 259, Route Cardinal Foch in the French Concession, to rent a passenger car. He stated that he would pay three yuan for a round trip to Dachang Town. The company immediately dispatched driver Chen Guilin (34 years old, from Nantong, residing at No. 240, Meixie Road) with a dark green sedan, city license plate No. 4370, rental permit No. 12453. While passing near Xinmin Village, Zhongshan Road, in Zhabei's Hutai Road, the passenger ordered the driver to stop by the side of the road. Four men jumped out. One robber had a dark face, wearing a black Xiangyunsha short shirt and pants, one wore a blue cloth short shirt and pants, appearing as a copper worker, one wore white twill short shirt and pants, and one wore a gray cloth long gown. The robber who had been on the car beforehand was wearing a blue silk long gown. They all spoke with a Jiangbei accent. They brandished two pistols. Two robbers, each holding a pistol, ordered Chen Guilin to get out of the car. They watched him walking slowly by the side of the road for about forty-five minutes. The three robbers then got back into the car and said to Chen, "Friend, please help. Don't make a sound. Be sensible. If you make a sound, or tell people about this afterward, we will shoot you. We are borrowing your car today to get revenge on someone. We haven't found him yet," and so on. The five robbers then drove off quickly in the car. Afterward, the driver separately reported to the Tanziawan and Pengpu Town police stations, asking them to track down the robbers, and at the same time reported to the Central Automobile Company by telephone. At around 11:00 AM, the car was suddenly discovered on Hutai Road (next to the west side of the former Hutai Automobile Company's main station entrance, Tonghe Li). According to the second team members of the Pengpu Defense Corps at that location, the car had been parked there since around 8:00 AM. No one was watching it, causing suspicion. They reported to the team headquarters for investigation and found out that it was the Central Automobile Company's car. They immediately notified the company by telephone to verify. The team then prepared a document to send the car to the Xinzha Sub-bureau for disposal. At around 6:00 PM in the afternoon, reporters went to investigate. The car was still at the team headquarters' entrance of Qiaoxing Li. The car was intact, without any damage.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Main Culprits in Major Robbery at North Station</h3>
<p>Victim is Fubing, Manager of Silver Shop - Twenty-one Large and Small Diamond Rings Stolen</p>
<p>Fu Bing, the manager of the Xinbaocheng Silver Shop in Wuxi, intended to return to Wuxi by train at 12:45 PM on February 8 of this year. While buying a ticket at the North Railway Station, he had no idea that a thief would steal four large diamond rings, seventeen small diamond rings, fourteen yuan in cash, and twelve aviation lottery tickets, worth a total of two thousand two hundred yuan, from his pocket and escape. Fu reported the theft to the local police station and requested an investigation, but the case had not been solved until 11:15 PM the night before last. Wang Chengying, the Chinese detective chief inspector of the Public Concession's General Inspectorate, and detective Qian Xianting, arrested Wu Dingqing, a Shaoxing native, related to the case, at the intersection of Route Robert and Gordon Road. Wu confessed that the main culprit was named Lu Youyuan, also known as A Gen, residing at No. 100, Lane 427, Xiaoshadu Road. The detectives rushed to the location and arrested Lu and his wife, Wu, together. The diamonds and other items they had stolen had already been completely sold, and from the proceeds, they had borrowed out 2,140 yuan. The remainder was used to purchase a pair of gold bracelets and three gold rings, which were all searched and seized by the detectives, along with the IOUs, and brought back to the police station. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that Fu Bing had not yet been notified, and the jurisdiction of the case also needed to be determined after investigation, so he requested that the case be postponed. When questioned, Lu Youyuan confessed to stealing Fu's diamonds, etc. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, verified the confession and ordered a postponement for further questioning in one week.</p>

<h3>Publishing Director of Guangyi Bookstore Requests Punishment for Copyright Infringement</h3>
<p>Zhu Xinzhi, 30 years old, from Shaoxing, is the publishing director at the Guangyi Bookstore at No. 137, Henan Road. Recently, a book entitled "Essentials of Eloquence for Beginners" (初學論說精華), written by Jia Ding Ling Baojun and with parallel translation of Classical and Vernacular Chinese, published by the bookstore in the third year of the Republic (1914), has been selling very well in Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces. It had been registered with the Beijing government and obtained copyright protection. Recently, because the book was no longer suitable for modern times, it was revised and re-registered with the central government. Unexpectedly, someone surnamed Fang, a native of Zhenjiang, residing at No. 4, Mujuli Lane, Zhaojia Road, brazenly pirated the book, claiming it was published by Guangye Bookstore, and also pirated the bookstore's "A Guide to Essays for Beginners" (初學論文指南), selling them widely, causing the sales of Guangyi Bookstore to decline. Zhu investigated and purchased two copies of each of the pirated books, and reported to the local City God Temple police station, requesting a search and severe punishment. The police immediately dispatched officers to make arrests, but only arrested Fang's wife, Ms. Wang, for questioning. The case involves copyright infringement and has been transferred to the court for legal action.</p>

All workers of the two factories have also decided to return to work. The city’s party and government agencies, in order to prevent further disputes, will send personnel to supervise along with the police bureau.</p>
<p>Silk Weavers’ Union Suspends Activities</p>
<p>The industrial unions of the silk weaving industry in the First District (Nanshi), Third District (West Shanghai), and Fourth District (Hongkou) have experienced repeated labor unrest due to the incompetence of their leaders, which could not be resolved. In order to eliminate disputes and reorganize the union organizations in the three districts, the city’s party and government agencies have ordered them to suspend activities. The city party headquarters will send personnel to reorganize them after the labor unrest is completely resolved.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Petitions City Government and Police Bureau Not to Detain Accusers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the municipal government yesterday stating: “Petitioning regarding a matter: Our Chamber has received a letter from the Shanghai Umbrella Trade Association stating that disputes often arise between people, or when they are subjected to infringement, they call the police. The police bureau, without investigating whether there is a reason for both parties, detains them all and sends them to the General Bureau. For example, in the case of our member, Sanxing Factory, in July of last year, due to a neighbor's dislike, they accused them of obstructing hygiene and requested they relocate. Later, our chamber petitioned the City Party Headquarters, Social Bureau, Health Bureau, and City Chamber of Commerce, and received approvals from the competent authorities stating that there was no obstruction and no need to relocate. Unexpectedly, a few days later, the Ximen Sub-bureau arrested the factory manager, Ma Zhiwen, without reason and sent him to the General Bureau for detention for a day. Later, our chamber sent a document and dispatched personnel to the bureau to explain, and although he was released, he lost a day of freedom and suffered unwarranted injustice. Furthermore, in September of the same year, our member, Huanqiu Factory, experienced a strike by workers without reason, and the workers gathered to obstruct the business and act violently. The police were called, and the violent actors were detained. Our chamber sent a document and dispatched personnel to meet with the chief of the Laobeimen Police Station, requesting a fair and strict handling of the matter. Chief Shen immediately said that if they wanted to severely punish the defendants, the accuser (referring to the manager of Huanqiu Factory) must accompany them to the station to listen to the questioning and be sent to the bureau together the next day. Otherwise, it would be impossible to handle the case. However, the factory manager believed that this approach would result in a loss of business and irreversible suffering in terms of mental, practical, and time costs. Furthermore, they would have to be detained in the same place as the perpetrators. Due to various reasons, they had to swallow their anger and answer that they were unwilling to accompany them. As a result, the workers were not brought to justice and safely escaped punishment. In summary, in the first item, the case of Sanxing Factory being reported for obstructing hygiene had already been approved by the competent authorities, stating that there was no obstruction and permission not to relocate. However, the bureau rashly detained them for half a day or a night. Although they were released later, the injustice they suffered was irreversible. Taking a step back, even if the police bureau had doubts about the accuser, they should order them to comply with the formal legal procedures. They should not exercise arbitrary actions during the period of political tutelage. In the second item, the case of Huanqiu Factory's workers going on strike without reason, gathering to obstruct business, and acting violently, had already been witnessed by nearby police officers. The factory manager also provided a detailed report, and the Chamber provided written proof. The facts were clear. However, the bureau not only did not deal with the current offense but also stated that they could not handle the case unless the plaintiff was detained at the same time, forcing the plaintiff to suffer the same detention and stigma as the defendant. The plaintiff found this unbearable in terms of emotion and reason. As a result, the plaintiff's grievance was not addressed, and the defendant's crime was released. Therefore, when there is an infringement, they are willing to endure it, fearing being detained in the same detention center. The perpetrators, knowing that they will not be brought to justice and aware of the plaintiff's weakness of not wanting to be detained together, act even more recklessly. If this continues, even if legitimate merchants encounter major grievances, they will inevitably fear reporting to the police. How can human rights be protected? How can national law be protected? Therefore, we request your association to petition the municipal government to order the police agencies to not detain accusers in the future. If the accuser's report is untrue, they can investigate the accuser's household registration address, whether they are a legitimate merchant, and order them to provide a guarantor to ensure that they are available for questioning at any time. They must not be detained pending trial. If they evade their obligations after providing a guarantor, the guarantor can be held responsible or fined accordingly. Therefore, the association believes that when merchants report or report to the police bureau for any reason, the police bureau detains them without regard to the circumstances, causing the accusers to suffer from detention before the accused is brought to justice. This is unfair to the legal principle. The association’s request is to protect human rights and prevent cunning individuals from attempting wrongdoing. It is reasonable to present the facts to your government and request approval to order the bureau to comply. This is in the public interest.”</p>

<h3>Excavation and Destruction of Ancestral Graves and Sale of Tomb Bricks Leads to Charges</h3>
<p>Shi Qixiang and Shi Bosheng, natives of the area, jointly owned ancestral graves and earthen mounds at Xiaoxujiatang, Caohejing. In December of last year, Shi Bosheng, due to extreme poverty, colluded with Yi Haiyun from Baoying, Jiangbei, and Xu Wennan from Taixian, to excavate and destroy the ancestral graves, and sell the tomb bricks, worth 1,300 yuan, after discarding the remains. Upon learning of this, Shi Qixiang reported it to the authorities, who arrested Shi Bosheng, Yi Haiyun, and Xu Wennan and transferred them to the local court. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution against them based on Article 249, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang opened the court to hear the case. Shi Qixiang testified that he lived at No. 9, Hexingfang, Foch Road, because we are all doing business in Shanghai, and the ancestral halls and tombs are all in Caohejing. He only learned of this when the clan reported it during the spring festival. He also retained a lawyer to file a civil suit seeking compensation of 1,300 yuan. When questioned, the defendants all admitted the crime. The court debate concluded, and the verdict will be announced on the 21st of this month. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Strictly Prohibits Receiving Stolen Electrical Wire</h3>
<p>Strict Punishment in Court Upon Discovery</p>
<p>The municipal government considers electrical and telephone poles and wires to be related to national defense and military and political communications among provinces. Recently, they have been stolen by bandits, disrupting traffic and having a huge impact. It has repeatedly ordered its subordinate police teams to seriously pursue and protect these items. All criminals involved in stealing or damaging communications equipment will be handed over to military law agencies to be punished according to the Provisional Measures for Punishing Bandits. These theft cases have slightly decreased. Recently, the municipal government received another order from the central government to thoroughly eliminate theft cases, strictly prohibiting the receiving of stolen goods and ordering strict investigation and seizure. Upon discovery, they will be sent to the court for severe punishment to maintain traffic efficiency. The order has been conveyed to the subordinates for compliance.</p>
<h3>Murder Suspect in Robbery Case in Pudong Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chen Tingzhang, owner of Huamei Electric Materials Company on Fuzhou Road, residing at No. 187, Yangjiazai Road, Pudong, was attacked by eight or nine robbers wearing masks and wigs at around 3:00 AM on May 4th of this year. The robbers climbed over the wall to carry out a robbery. Chen's eldest son, Chen Jiating (21 years old), attempted to resist with a shotgun, but was shot and wounded by the robbers. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the robbers scattered and fled. Chen Jiating died due to injuries to his waist. By 1:00 AM of the night before last, Wang Jiaju, a Chinese detective chief of the Laozha Police Station, and detective Liu Zhaotian, learned that Zhang Pingjiang, a local suspect in the case, must pass through the intersection of Guangxi Road and Guangdong Road. They went to wait and subsequently saw Zhang and a Suzhou woman, Zhao Jüzhen (20 years old, residing at No. 8, Lane 67, Mahuo Road), coming. They were arrested. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the case, stating that many more important criminals are still being pursued by the police, so he requested permission to detain them for further questioning. Tang Yinqiao, a servant of the victim's family, testified that Zhang was indeed holding a gun at the scene at the time. Zhang firmly denied it. Judge Qian Hongye verified the confession and ordered Zhang to be remanded in custody, and Zhao was granted bail of 100 yuan. The case was adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement Case of Former Clerk of the First Special District Court Suspended</h3>
<p>Defendant Chen Zongyu at Large</p>
<p>Chen Zongyu, former clerk of the Shanghai First Special District Court, after falling out with his wife, Qi Huizhen, lived with a prostitute, Wang Lanzhen, leading to lawsuits such as the capture of adultery. Later, the Civil Court ruled that Chen and Qi should be divorced. Recently, Chen has been practicing law, while Qi has filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office of the First Special District Court, accusing Chen Zongyu of embezzling money from Yang Jifang, owner of Puda Pharmacy, and Huang Huaishēng, owner of Jinan Film Company, during his tenure as a clerk. Prosecutor Song Genshan opened a court to investigate and ordered the arrest of Chen Zongyu, but to no avail. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Prosecutor Song has now filed a public prosecution against Chen Zongyu with the Criminal Court of the same level on charges of dereliction of duty and embezzlement. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye of the First Criminal Court heard the case. Chen had not yet been arrested, so the court summoned Qi Huizhen to question her about the facts of the accusation (which have been reported in detail before, so they are omitted). It is said that he has fled to Japan. Judge Qian stated that because Chen had not yet been brought to justice, it was difficult to proceed and that the case should be heard after the wanted notice was served. Therefore, he ruled that the trial proceedings be suspended.</p>
<h3>Stateless Western Woman Commits Suicide in Hotel</h3>
<p>Investigation into the Cause of Suicide is Underway</p>
<p>A Western woman, signing her name as (L.W. Mlsey), 29 years old, arrived at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road, near Futong Road, at 11:30 PM the night before last. She was well-dressed, graceful, and carried a small suitcase. She was led upstairs and assigned to Room 111. After the waiter brought tea, she immediately closed the door. All was quiet throughout the night. The next day at 11:00 AM, Wang Chunlin, the day shift tea boy, noticed that the Western woman had not yet gotten up. He tried to open the door to check on her. Unexpectedly, the woman was not in the room. Later, in the bathroom, she was found lying in the bathtub, lifeless. She had already passed away. He reported to the front desk, notified the Hongkou Police Station, and summoned an ambulance to transport the body to the Gongji Hospital and then to the coroner's office for examination.

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>The Lack of a Way to Health</h3>
<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>It's summer, and everyone is thinking about "hygiene." All "people" hope to "live to be a hundred years old." As for speculation and downfall, unemployment and jumping from buildings, although there is much more to them, it's simply because they cannot "live long" that they lightly hand their lives over to the King of Hell. Therefore, when a child is born, they must ask a blind fortune teller to break through the "gate of misfortune"; if they are still unlucky and die young, they will chop at the corpse a few times, hoping to get compensation in the second child; it also means "starting over."</p>
<p>These are all "general ideas." Although there was once a saying, "Human determination can overcome Heaven," it is ultimately quite forced. Thus, to supplement the insufficiency of "Heaven's will" is "human effort"; and this includes "the way of hygiene."</p>
<p>However, "the way of hygiene" each has its own "way." Members of the "Centenarian Society" have their self-made "secrets to health," such as "do more things, get angry less." This "secret" can indeed sometimes make people live long. The example right before our eyes is that they were able to participate in the "Centenarian Society." But there are also those who wanted to "do more things" and lost their lives: Ji Shenghong, who was competing to load lead wire at the dock, "ruptured his intestines and died an unnatural death" (see yesterday's newspaper). "Get angry less," you say? It's just that young people lack the ability to restrain themselves. At the slightest disagreement, they immediately resort to violence. First, there was the incident on Nanjing Road of drinking from a public water tap, and then there was the "glorious bloodshed" of customs officers. However, their ease of "getting angry" is also for the sake of—hoping to live long—not for "personal" benefit but for the "public good." This is perhaps something the inventors of the "secrets to health" did not think of.</p>
<p>This is the first point.</p>
<p>The second is the "secrets to unhealth." Taking ginseng and bird's nest in the morning, getting blood-boosting injections in the evening. Fortunately, they have plenty of money and wish they could gather all the supplements in one body. But they don't understand their own constitution or where the root of the illness lies. By the time they need to prescribe a "prescription," it leaves "all the doctors helpless." This is called "self-inflicted misfortune," so it's better not to say anything.</p>
<p>Most pitiable are those who have "no secrets to health." They are clearly "physically weak and suffering from hemoptysis," but when they "see a slight improvement," they feel that "the family has no property and needs a skill." So, through a friend's introduction, they go to a certain electrical appliance store on Fide Road to learn the craft of installing electric lights, which leads to "the old illness recurring, causing extreme pain." Thus, they "suddenly come to a realization" and jump from the fourth floor of the Great World (see yesterday's newspaper). This is another example.</p>
<p>Having written this far, I could have stopped. But, suddenly, I thought that in addition to these three, there is another category that belongs to forced hygiene. Although it has strayed further and further from the topic, it cannot be left unsaid. To give a recent example, it is the people living in attics. The Municipal Council insists on forcing them to be "hygienic" and demolishing their homes. But do they not know "the way of hygiene"? With this slice of health coming in early summer, they have already moved to the sidewalks to rest, with the blue sky as their quilt and the earth as their bed.</p>
<p>However, what worries people is that news of car accidents will also follow.</p>
<p>In a nutshell: "There is no way to health!"</p>
<h3>Opinions on "Wu Zetian"</h3>
<p>— Taisheng</p>
<p>(1) Miscellaneous Discussion of the Script</p>
<p>Judging by the effect of this performance and the level of acting, it is much better than "Romeo and Juliet." At least, the individual acting skills of the actors are very average, unlike "Romeo and Juliet," which is focused solely on two people.</p>
<p>As for criticism of the entire script, historical dramas like this are inherently difficult to write because, for this kind of costume drama, we cannot completely rely on the ancients (and there is no way to verify), nor can we imitate old plays. If the actions are too modern, it will definitely hinder the atmosphere of the historical drama.</p>
<p>Take the point of "dialogue," for example, and you can see the difficulty the playwright had in writing this script. For example, in Act IV, which depicts Wu Zetian's licentious harem life, the "dialogue" between Wu Sansi and Wu Chengsi seems a little too "pedantic": In Act II, when Wu Zetian uses tricks on Emperor Gaozong, she refers to Gaozong as "you" and herself as "I," which is completely inconsistent with the full-mouthed "Your subject" and "Your Majesty" of Emperor Zhongzong later on. I believe these places are not the author's textual negligence, but rather the author's indecision on whether to make it colloquial or to keep its original historical appearance.</p>
<p>Even taking the role of Emperor Gaozong as an example, under the author's and director's emphasis, this "Son of Heaven" of a dynasty has been completely "clownified." Especially in Act III, Gaozong kneels to Wu Zetian, and Wu Zetian wears a crown while Gaozong kneels prostrate at Wu Zetian's feet. In our opinion, even if an emperor is昏庸, he would not be</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>昏庸 to this extent.</p>
<p>(2) "Abnormal" Wu Zetian</p>
<p>Looking at the core of the script, the playwright Song Zhi said that this is: "In a traditional feudal society—that is, a male-centered society—the resistance and struggle of a woman."</p>
<p>What is Wu Zetian like under "resistance and struggle"? She despises men, she tries her best to retaliate. This "hysterical," abnormal woman deliberately tortures men, insults men, and hates men. Therefore, some people say that this script has "the danger of being written as the opposition between women and men."</p>
<p>But I think that Wu Zetian can only be regarded as an "abnormal" figure in history. We must never use modern ideas to punish "Wu Zetian" because, in a traditional feudal society, she naturally excludes others and wants to seize power herself. Because she deeply hates men, she deliberately insults them.</p>
<p>If the script really wanted to write about the "opposition between women and men," then Wu Zetian would never have killed Empress Wang.</p>
<p>(3) Acting and Stage Design</p>
<p>The reason why I want to discuss the actors' acting skills and the stage design together is that the amateur stage design has indeed surpassed the level of all Chinese theater troupes.</p>
<p>In general, the stage design abandons extravagance and gorgeousness and tends toward clarity and simplicity. For example, in Act II, before Wu Zetian appears, the audience immediately applauds when they see such a clear and beautiful stage, which is rarely seen in previous performances.</p>
<p>Now let's look at a few actors: Ying Yin's Wu Zetian is already as good as it can get. Her composure and refinement firmly grasp the character of Wu Zetian in the five acts. Her deep planning, her mad laughter and anger, her seizure of power, her stubbornness and strength—she is truly a rare talent among Chinese actresses.</p>
<p>There are many other actors who can act well, such as Zhang Manping's painful and tragic Miaozhen; Gu Eryi's cartoonish clownish Emperor Gaozong; Xiong Hui's flirtatious widow Lady Han; and Lv Fu's loyal minister Xu Cungong. They are all extremely successful and lovable actors.</p>
<p>Ye Luxi's Miaoyu seems to be deeply influenced by Zhao Dan's style, especially in the first act. I hope she can find her own way. Lv Ban's Xue Huaiyi is ultimately too over the top. Wang Ping's old nun is still good.</p>
<p>Speaking of actors, we are mostly satisfied. The music is better than last time, and the lighting effects are exceptionally beautiful.</p>
<p>The entire performance is best in Acts I, II, and III; Act IV is a little worse; and Act V is a failure.</p>
<p>Writing ramblingly, this is not a criticism but only my own impressions after watching.</p>
<p>The Second Comment by Li Yi</p>
<p>It is not easy to write a critique of "Wu Zetian." First, at least the critic should read more historical materials about Wu Zetian and compare them with the script to see if there are any distortions or arbitrary points. Second, one should read the script several times and carefully study it to see if there are any characters or events that should be added or deleted. Regarding these, I am not qualified to do, and I think it is definitely not something that one or two people can do. A fair evaluation of it can only be handled by collective efforts, perhaps through a symposium.</p>
<p>Now, writing "impressions after watching" is naturally different from "criticism." But it's still not easy to please. This work is especially difficult for me. However, it may be worthwhile to write a little, hoping to gain something from a thousand thoughts. If there is a symposium in the future, then it may as well be considered a few questions raised.</p>
<p>Director Shen Xiling has already told us about the biggest difficulty in staging historical plays: "We have no way to verify the actions and habits of the characters at that time. We are neither willing to flow into the type of Beijing opera with sleeves and stroking beards, nor can we presumptuously add modern actions." This is really a "headache" thing. To solve this difficulty, I think, we may as well assume that there is a standard and then follow it as a goal to do it: in this way, the performance can be unified. If it is not good, it can be corrected in the next play. Like this performance, what I feel is that the actors' actions have not tended to be uniform. For example, I felt that the actions of Ye Luxi and Yan Gong were modern and somewhat Westernized. The former, especially in the first act, that action is extremely should be changed.</p>
<p>Regarding the theme of this play, I generally agree, but I don't know why, intuitively, I always feel that the author is faintly setting up the opposition between men and women; this is probably because my understanding is too weak, so I can't say why. This kind of feeling is of course not very strong, and I only hope that this is my prejudice, but if it is true, then I hope to find a way to avoid it, because the future society is definitely not a</p>

<p>the rejection of both sexes, but the cooperation of both sexes.</p>
<p>In the original script (published in "Women's Life"), there was the role of Shangguan Wan'er, but it was gone when it was staged. There are also additions and deletions in other places. Whether Shangguan Wan'er should be deleted is not discussed here, but from the perspective of "drama," I think the existence of Shangguan Wan'er can make it more lively, especially in the fifth act, it must be more lively than it is now. As for the final climax, I think the effect would be better if a fire were set afterward, but I don't know if there is any discrepancy in time.</p>
<p>Regarding the stage design and lighting, I think it is shameless to describe them with the words "unprecedented." The actors' acting skills are also very average and very outstanding here. Ying Yin's Wu Zetian not only surpassed the plays she had played before, but the other actors also had amazing achievements, such as Zhang Manping's Miaozhen and Xiong Hui's Lady Han. Although they have very few scenes, they give you an unforgettable impression here. This is really the most suitable and equally matched cast.</p>
<h3>Woods and Fields</h3>
<p>— Wang Rendong</p>
<p>This is an early summer morning, and I am walking alone in these woods and fields.</p>
<p>The blue sky is revealed from the gray clouds and sifts down through the branches and leaves at the bottom of the trees. The feather-shaped leaves at the bottom of the locust trees sway left and right like rings hanging on a woman's ears when a breeze blows. Beetles chirp in the grass under my feet, and the chirping sound is a backdrop to the tranquility of these woods and fields.</p>
<p>Black butterflies fly gracefully like paper ashes; the silk spun by spiders shines in the sunlight and stretches to the branches.</p>
<p>White, rice-shaped wildflowers are scattered over the green grass. I kick aside the weeds, and dew wets my shoes. Occasionally, a gray rabbit darts past me and disappears into the deep grass...</p>
<p>The weather is gradually turning gloomy. An old and seasoned turtledove hums a rain-inducing song in the distance. I found a stone tablet next to a puddle and sat down on it. This puddle was originally formed by the accumulation of rainwater in the low part of the mountain. The light green water surface reflects the sky sifting through the gaps in the leaves, and some leaves that have fallen from the locust trees above float on it.</p>
<p>A gust of breeze: the leaves at the bottom of the locust trees are swaying like earrings again.</p>
<p>The sky is even gloomier, and no clear sky can be seen from the sparse gaps at the bottom of the trees. All that can be seen is the dim, gray clouds. The sound of the beetles has subsided; the breeze only comes every now and then. The turtledoves are also reluctant to call out any more. At this time, only a turtledove on a nearby tree suddenly coos! Coo-coo, deeply, like the sound in an old man's wheezing throat. Coo! Coo-coo!</p>
<p>This entire mountain forest, this entire green mountain forest, this gloomy mountain forest, is called to death by it. — Only depression permeates here. However, this taste of peacefulness, flowing into my heart.</p>
<p>When I came back, I plucked some locust pods from the locust tree; they were green, some slightly tinged with red; I want to take them home, I let them grow such woods and fields, such depression, darkness, and greenness of these woods and fields in my heart. However, among them, I must also have some seeds of hope hanging on those branches, like these locust pods.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Entertainment Supplement Dance Art Special Issue Encourages the Dance Art World</h3>
<p>— Bo Qiao</p>
<p>Ge Tian invented singing, and Yin Kang invented dancing. Singing and dancing have a long history in our country. It is said that when examining major ethnic groups around the world, whether they are civilized or uncivilized, they all have their own national songs and dances. The love of music and the love of singing and dancing are human nature, and it seems that human power cannot stop them.</p>
<p>Now, let's put aside singing and talk about dancing. All the major advanced ethnic groups in the world have their own styles that are suitable for their national character. The United States is a country of liberalism, and its style contains the meaning of freedom. France and Italy love art, and their style can express beauty everywhere. Germany and Russia have a strong national character, and their postures and movements are enough to express their fortitude. The British people have always regarded themselves as born favorites. From the gentry to the common people, they all regard themselves as gentlemen in clothes and hats. Therefore, their actions are gentle and elegant. Each has its own unique national character style, and each is suitable for its own needs. Why must they all be the same?</p>
<p>Since the European War, countries have adopted the British style of social dance, which is free, elegant, and generous. That is, the so-called standard style has become popular all over the world in less than ten years. However, they can still maintain their own national character, and each adds or subtracts and transforms it with its own characteristics.</p>
<p>Our country is a land of clothing, etiquette, and courtesy for thousands of years, and its characteristics seem to be the same as those of the United Kingdom. We should follow the trend and adopt the British style. However, we sincerely hope that our country's dance art circles will work together to learn from others' strengths and overcome their weaknesses, and further transform them, just as when we learn calligraphy, we first copy the model, and after we have mastered the essence, we may as well make slight changes and create a new style. This depends on the efforts of the majority of the dance art circles.</p>
<h3>The Grand Occasion of the Costume Banquet and Dance Party at the Paramount Last Night</h3>
<p>— A Xiang</p>
<p>The International Art Drama Society held a costume banquet and dance party at the Paramount last night. Almost all Chinese and foreign celebrities and wealthy merchants in Shanghai attended, and most of them participated in costumes. There were many performances in the hall. In particular, the national martial arts performance by the Jingwu Sports Association was the most popular, which indeed added glory to the national martial arts community in our country. The grand occasion was unprecedented, and it only ended at one o'clock this morning.</p>
<h3>Orchestra Introduction</h3>
<p>The Paramount Orchestra consists of eleven people, led by Ms. Gloria Andicos.</p>
<h3>A Tour of the Dance Halls</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>Shanghai, the so-called Paris of the East, has skyscrapers, racecourses, dog racing tracks, pelota, movie theaters, and dance halls. In terms of nightlife, Avenue Joffre and Szechuan Road each have their own exotic flavors, cafes, hotels, and disguised meat markets. Especially dance halls, although some have closed down due to their inability to maintain themselves, they are still constantly springing up like bamboo shoots after rain.</p>
<p>If someone comes to Shanghai to play, they will definitely go to the dance hall to take a look, but people who are new to Shanghai are not familiar with the inside story of the dance hall, unless they find familiar friends, but here can give you some reference; if you want to visit some of the more magnificent dance halls, then the Paramount is the place to go, the dance floor is very appropriate, and there is a glass dance floor above, which is lined with colored lights, which is not available in other dance halls in Shanghai, the light and music equipment are unexpectedly beautiful, in addition, we can go to Vienna to walk around, there are special "bean paste" and "dried shrimps" to respect the guests, even if friends who do not dance can use it to pass the time in addition to enjoying the music, the same place is almost the same, is the opposite of the Metropolitan, the music inside will make you particularly excited, there is a large garden, decorated very beautifully, in addition, there is Lido, also a fairly magnificent dance hall, inside there is a swimming pool, in addition to watching dancing, you can also watch swimming, if you want to visit some cheaper places, then there are Yangtze • Datong • Da Hu • Happy • International • Da Xin • Cathay • Jue Lu • Far East • Anle Palace, there are some fresh things in Datong, their orchestra stage is rotating, especially using two classes of male and female orchestras to take turns playing, when changing, the two classes play a song together, the stage rotates at a flat angle, one begins to rest.</p>
<p>After the ordinary dance halls close, then you may as well go to Dahua, their time is one and a half hours later than others, when others close, they are lively, you can see guests with dance girls or dance girls' sisters, in groups of three or five to play, there is a roof garden above, you can see the night view of Shanghai, in case you intend to play all night, then Lao Dahua is a place to go, the place is very ordinary, people who go there are mostly couples, you can see them sitting quietly in the rattan chairs in each room, rarely dancing, just looking for other kinds of fun.</p>
