<p>電信特琹</p>
<p>短波</p>
<h3>飛快年</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>自本年一月起，京滬鐵路，開辦飛快車，三北公司之龍興輪，駛行滬漢問亦縮短航程，改為特快，如此情形，足見交通界中。充分加速發展，充分表現進步，於是有入擬稱今年為飛快年。</p>
<p>就過去加以觀察，我國各種建設，進步確很遲滯，比較各國，相差總在十年以上，欲求民族復興，國力充實，自然對於國內建設，加緊努力不可，所謂迎頭趕上，尤須飛快趕上，是則本年之為飛快年，固不祇希望交通界飛快進步，更希望各種事業，亦飛快進展。</p>
<p>鐵路航輪電信，同為交通上重要工具，鐵路有飛快，航輪有特快，電信自亦應大快而特快，不過電信交通，隨時在加速加快，却並不以特快飛快為號召，更無須加以特快飛快之名稱，蓋電信本身，速度為重，其傳遞之迅捷，呼應之靈敏，發報發話人知之，社會亦無不知之。</p>
<p>電信雖不必標示特快或飛快，但電信之進展，處處可與特快飛快相暗合，如果亦仿鐵路輪船之例，有飛快年之稱，則所謂飛快年者，當不自今始。由民國二十一年起，電信逐漸進步，尤以最近三年中，進步更見飛快。傳遞速率之增加，通話範圍之擴展，縮千里如彈丸，通兩地如晤對，一轉瞬耳，快何如之。若舉其重要施設而言。則長途電話九省盡通，聯絡便捷，國內外無綫電，通報亦遠及世界各國，滬漢滬粵，並已裝用無綫電話，此外電報方面，國內重要都市，亦復先後改裝克利特印字報機，舉凡通話報，莫不較前便利，較前加速，以數年之建設，而得如此結果，自不能謂為普通快，而為飛快特快矣。繼續努力，一快而無所不快，鐵路航輪然，電信亦何獨不然。</p>
<h3>交通部國內長途電話之兩種新辦注（續）</h3>
<p>— 溥沾</p>
<p>新年之新貢獻</p>
<p>人不能恒靜不動，所以人事也變化無常，用戶已經裝了話機，並且向電局登記、繳納長途電話保證金、或填具接通長途電話聲請書，對於傳發長途電話，固屬便利，但偶逢有事在外接洽，急切問需發長途電話和在遠地的關係人商酌，或有每日服務處所不定而需隨時傳發長途電的人、不巧所在地的所裝話機、未經向電局登記，按照現行未登記之用戶話機不能傳發長途電話的規定，此時勢非專程回至業已登記之自裝話機處所，或至附近長途電話零售處，掛號等候通話不可，其間，時間上之損失，固不待論，假使遇有重要事件，必須當塲處理，而不能分身的時候，必致顧此失彼，損失更重了！有了登記用戶可以借機發話的辦法，嗣後祇須向電局聲請，照章將話費列在自裝已登記話機話費賬上，負責繳付，凡屬同一市內電話營業區域內的話機，隨時隨地都可借用發話，既無往返奔波之勞，又無貽誤事機之感，時間經濟更毫無損失、可謂一舉數得。同時因為辦法上規定，發話人發話掛號之前，必須預先通知自裝業已登記之話機，告以擬借用某號電話，傳發長途電話至某處，然後再由電局向發話人所指定付費之自裝已登記話機的聽守人查詢一次，方為接通，可保無他人冒名發話之弊，設想更非常週到。</p>
<p>至於呌人通话之发话或受話人適因事外出，如發话或受话用戶确知该发話或受话人現在何處，並肢處亦裝有電话時，可將其電話號碼告知電局改接通話，其辦法，與上述發話人得借機發話辦法，有異曲同工之妙；在一般人的習慣上，沒有急切緊要的事情，很少使用長途電話，所以當受話人外出時遇有長途來話，受話用戶雖明知該話人之所在，而不能立刻呌回接話，以剖解此次來話，究為何種重要事件，或發話人掛號後，因某種要事急須外出，不能守候通話，其懊喪之情，可想而知，有了這個辦法，祇要在裝有話機的地方，不必另加費用，就可改接，困難問題，迎刃而解，所以這兩種辦法，可以稱為摩登時代的摩登辦法。（完）</p>
<h3>使用長途電話歟抑電報歟</h3>
<p>— 山榮海</p>
<p>現代社會人士，對於電信交通之整個運用，正因其種類繁多，而不知何以採擇。卽何者應發長途電話？何者應發電報？方始合於運用的經濟條件。關於此點，如無辨別之經驗，住往因應發電話而竟發電報，或應發電報而竟發電話，以致低减運用電信交通之效用，而成受經濟與時間之損失。不佞於此，願為一言，略作貢獻：</p>
<p>欲求上項問題之適當解决，吾人先應對於電話電報之性質，及其優點，作一分析之比較，究竟使用何項為宜，兹為分析如下表：</p>
<p>觀於右表，則可知電話與電報在相互此較之下，各有優點，亦各有弱點。故社會人土，對於運用電信交通之採擇，不妨依照上表所列兩種工具優弱之不同，與其需要之出發點，加以審核而决定之。卽凡趨重於體據性，與時間性者，如銀行匯欵等等，自以拍發電報為宜。反之，其注重於立刻等待回音，以解决某一種事件者，則自可登長途電話。以上所論，不過聊為舉例，社會人士對淤二者使用慣時，則知所抉擇矣。</p>
<h3>指導全國廣播電台播送節目辦法之公布</h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>各地民營廣播電台逐日播送之節目，往往偏重於游藝方面，尤多採用低級趣味之歌曲唱詞及迷信荒誕之故事，不但不能收播音教育之宏效，且不免有誨淫誨盜之流弊。交通部有鑒於斯，特訂定“指導全國廣播電台播送節目辦法”種，於二十五年十月二十八日公布施行。該項辦法並已由交通部分令北平，漢口，杭州，上海，天律，吳縣，無錫，銅山，高郵，鄞縣，紹與，蕪潮，廈門，武進等處電局轉知當地各民營廣播電台切實遵照辦理，以符功令。各地政府機關所辦廣播電台對於該項辦法，亦須同樣遵辦，業经交通部分別咨请有开各省政府市政府查照转飭同時实行，以歸一律。</p>
<p>上述“指導人全国電台播送節目辦法之內容，分為下列各項</p>
<p>一，關於編排節目之手續各廣播電台（包括公營民營各廣播電台）應將播音節目種類及播送時間預編節目時間表，遵照交通部之規定，送請中央執行委員會廣播事業指導委員會審查核淮後，方可實行播送。嗣後如須更改節目，亦須呈報核准後再實行。各廣播電台並應光期編排節目內容預報表，將逐日播送每種節目之標題（例如演講講題戲劇歌曲名稱）及擔任人員姓名，以及預定之播送時間）例如某日某時至某時某人演講最近國際形勢，某某歌舞團唱某某名曲）等項詳細列入表內，送呈中央廣播事業指導委員會審閱。如有更改之必要，得由中央廣播事業指導委員會通知改正之。各廣播電台對於預定之節目，如因不得已事故，須臨時變更或增减播送時間，或暫予停播者，其更改增刪或停播之節目，應以不超撾每日節目之五分之一為限。各廣播電台播間節目時間內，應照交通部之規定，轉播中央廣播電台播音節目（例如黨國要人之演講）。其無轉播機件之設備者，得報明暫停轉播。凡遇中央廣播電台有特別重要節目，經中央廣播事業指導委員會認為有轉播之必要時。交通部得隨時通知辦理之，但至多每日以轉播一個節目為限。</p>
<p>二，關於節目內容之分配及選擇各公營廣播電台分配之逐日播音時間，其成分應以關於宣傳教育演講方面佔多數。民營廣播電台對於宣傳教育演講節目，亦不得少於百分之四十，其娛樂節目至多不得超過百分之六十·所有各商行請求播送之商業廣告，應包括在娛樂節目以內，但播送時間不得超過播送娛樂節目時間之三分之一（例如播送娛樂節目時間為三十分鐘，則每一唱片中間插入之廣告播音，其時間累積計算，不得逾十分鐘。）各廣播電台除娱樂節目外，對於宣傳教育演講節目，應以國語播送為原則，暫時兼用當地方言播送者，並應另加教授國語節目。</p>
<p>各廣播電台對於逐日播送之節目，務須審愼選擇。凡有干禁例或思想偏激之言論，及近於誨淫誨盜或迷信荒誕之故事，歌曲，唱詞，均不得播送。否則交通部得按情節之輕重予以警告或罰令停止播音，以示不懲儆。</p>
<p>三，關於播音時刻之校對及規定各廣播電台播送節目之時刻，應以規定之各區標準時刻為標準。此項標準時刻，應與中央廣播電台每日播音報告之時刻校對之。又在同一市區或縣城以內，已設有一百瓦特之廣播電台達五座以上者，該地未滿一百瓦特之廣播電台對於播送節目之時間，應加限制，由交通部隨時規定飭知，不得超越。</p>
<p>四，關於不守章規之取締各地廣播電台對於上述各節，如不切實遵照“指導全國廣播電台播送節目辦法”辦理者，得由交通部酌量情節之輕重，予以警告或取締，或竟予以勒令停止播音或吊銷執照之處罰。</p>
<p>上項“指導全國廣播電台播音節目辦法”公布實行以後，各地廣播電台對於節目之編排，分配，選擇等項，旣已有所遵循，當可不至再有達記章規情事，自取其咎，故本刊對於該項辦法、樂為介紹，以供衆覽。（完）</p>
<h3>成文交際電報之因素及其持色</h3>
<p>— 山榮海</p>
<p>成文交際電報，在電報業務中，為吾國獨有之產物。關於此種電報業務之倡造，其意義不外下列三點：㊀電報之傳遞以符號為文字之代表，此為電報家當初發明時之一個最要關鍵，迄今尚未龍推翻此定案，而另易別種方法，（現在發明之傳眞電報，在歐美雖盛行，但因成本及組織方面之高貴與複雜，尚未能普遍推行，故無論如何，在我國决不能成為電報事業結構中之主要組織。）故一國之文字，在電報事業之結構方面，關係至為重大。但吾國文字，不若歐美文字組織之簡單，故在傳遞電報方面，迄今尚沿用四個號碼，以為電報符號之變易的根據（現在發明之華文電報打字機及國音電報等，尚未普遍實行，故此處不加論述）。於是在電報文字之組織上，必須、一字四碼，無法增減，故欲電文簡短實無可能。㊁吾國自古稱為禮義之邦，對於婚喪大典，所有禮節，與歐美不同，而於文字上表現之種種意義，親疏長幼，各有分別，故欲撰述一種交際之書札或小啟，非老於交際者殆無縱下筆。㊂吾國電報事業，近年因當局之整飭，以及全國職工之努力，進步甚速，但因成本關係，現定電報價目，除本省電報，已減低百分之三十外，無從再為縮減，而一般民衆，大多受國內生產衰落以及商業簫條之影響，均有感到經濟力薄弱之病態。利用電報通信者甚少，因此國內電報營業，在此種情勢之下，尚未能盡量發展。直至民國二十二年八月間國內交際電報辦法頒行以後，一般商民，對於拍發電報之興趣，於以濃厚。但就精密的統計方面觀察，該項交際電報，一方面因取費低廉，未免虧及成本，一方面如逾規定字數，仍須遞加報費，經濟力有所不這‘歡補教二再缺點，乃有成文交際電報辦扶之創行。</p>
<p>關於成文交際電報，在吾觀電報集積中，其所以成為倡作之原因，飪有上述之三點，故其施行之結果‘讓少亦有下列三絕之特色：</p>
<p>㊀吾國電報價目，飪囚咸本關係，不能再為威低，在普通民眾心濺方面，劉淤拍升電報，鰓為非有重大華故絕無此種需要。今爾內成文交際電採，既有一定之低搬價目，便於社會任何階級，均能有利用之機會，即可籍此引起民眾普遍發電之興趣與習償。</p>
<p>㊁吾國針會情形，極腦柴尚神節，今國內成文交際電報，雖屬一紙電文，但在收報人精神上於接到電報時，定必想像百千里以外發輟人之盛意，而纏到無磯之興奮，而在發報人方面，則又覺輕而易舉，並不受到時問空間及物貿上之一切拘束。</p>
<p>㊂視代社會交際，實巳趨重齡書面之一近，即精神之交際，，於物質之然增，故威詞較聯等，已為一般．通民眾所稱道。但大多數發工商民，尚無此徑典雅之思懇力，今國內肢文交觀電報之，文詞旬，均已代為撰定，形形色色，無不俱邊，長報人祇頭加以審據，即可抓發，即在智識界方面，亦叮富卸購甜之時間。</p>
<p>國內成文交際常報，既有上述之因素，及其優點，吾人放大目光，加以觀察，非僅為便利一絞民眾，及發攝零報業務之一種時代産物，其對於社會交際制度之改良，以及民間文化之點綴，亦有莫大之努力存焉。</p>

<h3>第七十次議會中表現出的日本矛盾（下）</h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>這就是政友會提議只减少預算案三億元的理由，也就是民政黨特别注意「外交失敗」的理由。要想這兩大政黨能對政府强硬到底，那真是很難希望的。到頭還是不能不犧牲大衆的利益，這就是日本政黨的弱點，也就是日本政黨必然趨於没落，必然發生分化的客觀條件。</p>
<p>所以，目前無論政黨如何强硬，這强硬，也將只是呌呌而已。這和不健全的中間景氣相同，决不能挽救本身的没落，也决不能防止日本的右傾政治—深刻的非議會非政黨的政治。所謂一議會政治復興一的企圖，現在是止被非常時的國防第一主義踐踏着。代替議會政治的，將是急速的法西斯化的政治。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>在兩大政黨中，自去年十月軍部提出議會改革案後，即已有自重派和强硬派的分野。强硬派反對法西斯化，要求政黨更生，主張對現內閣提出不信任案，藉以打擊法西勢力。參加這一派的，有民政黨的齋藤隆夫和政友會的濱田國松……等。自重派多是兩黨的幹部，主張政黨應當　重，與政府作戰時，應府慮到對政局所發生之影響。由這兩派不同的見解，很可以看出現階段日本資本家中間的內在矛盾。而且，由于資本家中間的內在矛盾之加强，就形成了最近政黨反政府的强硬態度。</p>
<p>在一月十四日東商新年宴會中，一部份資本家，曾痛駡有田外交的失敗。在十八日經濟聯盟新年宴會中，大橋新太郎（産業資本家，貴族院議員）起而演説，發表他對於龐大預算案的不滿。由這演説裏面，透露出「日本工業俱樂部」的有力會員，和以「全産聯」爲中心的資本家中，反政府的空氣，已是意外的濃厚。此外，在十九日大倉組新年宴會中，民政黨議員實業家增田義一氏，也作了極憤激的演説，對馬塲財政，極力反對。當日參加宴會的資本家，約有五百人，對於增田義一民的主張，都拍手喝采，表示贊成。空氣之緊張，爲近年東京財界所僅有。甚至其中一部份與軍需工業有關的資本家，也都憂心原料之飢饉，騰貴，及勞動工銀之提高，表示願意支持既成政黨，對政府作必死的反抗！（一月二十一日—東京讀賣）</p>
<p>在别一方面呢？新政黨運動之進行，也很積極。寺內陸相會經對近衛公（日本貴族院議長）説：「這一次的議會，空氣非常險惡。既成政黨，毫無希望，只有期待革新的新政黨的實現了。請您爲了國家，多盡一點力吧。」（十一月十九日—東京朝日）</p>
<p>同時，一月二十日的東京讀賣上，也登載了下面的新曲：</p>
<p>在政黨立於生死之重大歧路時，政黨內部的革新派，已在極秘密裏進行新政黨運動，新黨運動的中心人物，是政友會議員中島久知平（海軍機關學校出身，飛行機製作所所長，政友會中之自重派），前田米藏（現政府中之鐵相，爲政友會之入閣閣僚），及貴族院議員有馬賴寗和兒玉秀雄兩伯爵。建設新黨的要點，有下列兩項：</p>
<p>（一）爲企圖議會政治之再建，必須依　軍民一致恊力之新體制，斷行强力政治。</p>
<p>（二）發揮憲法政治之真髓，排斥所謂的憲政常道，根本肅淸政黨，一掃從來之腐敗墮落現象，在新鮮的日本主義精神之下。成立憲法政治之母體。</p>
<p>新黨運動的議員，已經進謁寺內陸相和永野海相，懇求精神的支援了。新黨的總裁，據傳説將由近衛公，林銑十郎大將，宇垣一成大將，及南次郎大將中之一人担任之。</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>根據上述的種種事實，第七十次議會後之日本，是更可以想見的了。所謂的革新政黨，必將凌駕既成政黨而出現，所謂的强力內閣，也必將在最近期間代替廣田內閣而登台。至於龐大的預算案呢？在尊重國防，但允許稍事修改的條件下，總是可以設法通過的。</p>
<p>不能設法的是：日本內部的矛盾，更比以前加强了。—但，只要能發展殖民地，鞏固在殖民地的統制，這矛盾也是能暫時緩和的。一月二十二日</p>

<h3>陸海兩相選難日組閣工作頓挫</h3>
<p>林與軍部政策露歧異點　解散議會問題最感棘手</p>
<p>［東京］一般人僉信林銑十郎今晨自與寺內永野會晤後、組閣工作當可順利進行、但事實不然、林氏與寺內永野間關於新陸海相人選問題之意見、已顯露歧異之點、卽如陸海相人選、林氏擬以板垣及末次二氏分別充任、而寺內永野則分別推荐中村及藤田二氏、為陸海相之候選人、林氏雖遣使者與寺內永野作第二次協商、但寺內永野拒加考慮、因此組閣工作突陷僵局、究其內因、在於政策之岐異、遂致引起林氏與陸海軍方面之磨擦、雙方現正謀打開僵局之方策、林氏於午後五時二十五分訪問陸軍參謀總長閑院宮後、復於五時五十五分往訪寺內永野、目前解散議會為最感棘手問題之一、林氏認為此時對此問題、勿預先加以决定、俟議會重開檢討情勢後、再予定奪、較為相宜、此點與陸軍意見似相背馳、此外尚有其他政策、陸海軍方面亦未能同意、故林銑十郎內閣之能否成功已成問題、目前殊難逆料也、（三十一日中央社電）</p>
<p>［東京］林大將今晨訪問寺內陸相之結果、寺內陸相推舉教育總監部本部長中村幸太郎中將為繼任陸相、然林大將欲推關東軍參謀長坂垣征四郎中將為陸相、又永野海相今晨會見林大將後赴紀尾井町謁見軍令部長伏見宮報告林大將請求推慮繼任海相之事、並協議要事後辭出、海相又訪問林大將傳達海軍意見、推舉藤田大將為繼任海相、然因林大將希望末次大將就任海相、兩者意不一致、永野海相返其官邸後、與山本次官登田軍務局長清水人事局長等有所協議、永野海相根基於伏見宮之意見、愼重考慮海相人選、海軍當局鑒於時局嚴重、又有統一部內之必要、堅持其最初主張、故非由林大將之讓步、海相問題似難解决、（三十一日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］林大將奉组閣大命時、軍部表示滿足、因此衆信林大將之组閣工作、必可顺利進行、然三十一日林大將與軍部開始交涉時、軍部座相問題、俄然逢着難關、對於組閣前途、投一抹暗影、據一般觀察、其原因係組閣本部與軍部推舉之大臣不一致、然其實際、內而有林內閣擬實行之庶政革新政綱政策及議會解散等複雜問題、以致陸海軍與林大將之問、發生不同意見也、卽軍部與林大將之見解互相不同者、不僅人事問題、尚有政策上之不同意見、故其前途頗堪注目、（三十日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］林大將自二一十日下午一時半在組閣本部、與十河信二·大橋八郎·河田烈等商議組閣方針、其結果决為一新人心起見、脫離舊套組織明朗之新內閣、於是着手組閣工作、然是日限於進行內部的工作、故僅任命十河為書記官長、大橋八郎為法制局長官、而自三十一日起開始表面的工作、（卅一日同盟社電）</p>
<p>［東京］林銑十郎遴選閣員、仍在秘密洽商中、各方對繼任人選雖紛紛加以推測、伊皆不能視為可靠、林氏行動之趨勢、在若干方面似仍未能與陸軍脗合、林氏所持此緩進之方針、顯示日本在最近之將來、不致遭受重大之變化、據此間一般觀察、議會雖勢必解散、但因政局之極端錯綜複雜、林氏自將加以嚴重之考慮、故在預算案未經通過之前、避免解散仍留有一綫之希望、林氏命十河信二為書記官長、極堪注目、關於外相候選人物、雖傳説紛紜、如佐藤尚武·齋藤博·東鄉茂德·永井柳太郎等繼任外相之説、現甚囂塵上、但多屬毫無根據、而建川美次亦有同時提出為外相候選人之説、尤非意料所及、（三十一日中央社電）</p>
<h3>羅致人材</h3>
<p>推行大陸政策　愼選商工藏相</p>
<p>［東京］林內閣因有改革行政之使命、兩三閣員之職將由林首相或其他閣員兼任、亦未可知、昭和十二年度及其以後之龐大豫算、雖以廣田內閣之辭職、不得不重新提出議會、然因國際情形嚴重、大陸政策正待實行、日本財政之膨脹殆不可避免、因此改革財政公債政策與統制經濟之強化等重要財政政策、愈加重要性、同時由廣義的國際而論、振興產業·伸暢貿易·以計國力之充實、為新內閣應採用之重要國策、故林大將考慮大藏商工農林等大臣之人選、必以極愼重之態度、由官界實業界方面物色人材、（卅一日同盟電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>華北的新局勢</h3>
<p>— 禹</p>
<p>數星期來。綏邊前綫沉寂。華北整個局勢似乎也相當的安靜。有些人也許會認為侵略者眞的將‘放下屠刀’了可是事實並不這樣簡單任何劇變的根苗。都隱伏在沈靜的表面之下。就最近幾日的情勢看來。華北前途的憂患實在還是我們萬不能忽視的。</p>
<p>我們以為侵略綏邊的匪偽軍及其指使者。由於已往失敗的教訓。此後必將進一步實施其更周密更險惡的陰謀。只等適當時機到來。大規模的進犯恐怕要重新發動的據報二十三日匪偽首領及某方工作人員在嘉卜寺會議對犯綏事件已有重要的新决議所傳定於二十八日大舉進犯綏東雖然未曾實現但連日匪偽各部隊的積極向西移動以及陸續從熱河運送大批軍火糧食赴前綫。都足以證明更嚴重的危機是迫在眉睫了。</p>
<p>再就冀察最近的情勞來説這幾天日方海陸軍武。官迭次會議對於如何擴大冀東偽組織和如何加緊特務機關工作這些問題都有了具體的决定而關內外日本兩軍部偽滿偽冀東四方面連同平津一帶失意政客軍閥。並將於春節內在津秘密開一擴大會議。討論對華北時局推動辦法。顯然。他們所策畫的無非是怎樣抓住華北罷了。</p>
<p>至於經濟方面近來在‘親善’‘合作’的美名之下‘經濟提携’也重復推進二十五日華北日駐屯軍部天津總領事館興中公司滿鐵會社各代表曾在天津召開華北經濟開發懇談會對于築路開鑛水利植棉等等都已商定了具體的計畫。然而這還是他們在華北經濟上公開的活動。更可慮的是走私問題。這幾天來。在某方軍部支持之下。華北走私的猖獗。比去年春季還要厲害。走私機關用大批載重汽車運送私貨。武裝隊伍在後保護。竟使緝私總稽查處束手無策。英國駐津領事也不得不十分關切了。這種情形。又不僅限于華北。據聞閩南沿海各縣。近來走私之風也大盛。可見這種侵害我國稅權的活動是出于大規模的計畫的。</p>
<p>總之。當前的華北局勢。外弛而內緊。我們必須時刻加以密切的注視。就其危機的根苗。趁早作妥善而堅决的應付。否則這一局勢發展下去。我們國家的主權。必然是要受到慘烈的侵害的。</p>

<p>維護和平蘇聯不應獨被擯棄　條約須受尊重軍縮務求實現</p>
<p>法國夏多魯城　本城歐戰陣亡將士紀念碑、本日舉行落成典禮、外長臺爾博斯當卽發表演説、説明國際局勢、並答復德元首希特勒昨在該國衆院所發表之宣言、其言有曰、希特勒元首演説詞、並無攻擊吾國之處、並謂為人類福利起見、法德兩國不宜發生爭執、余聞斯言甚為欣慰、蓋以吾國志願正復相同也、惟是立國斯世、不僅法德兩國、因而維護和平一事、决非法德兩國所能單獨為之、須當信守一般的規則、其尤要者卽遵守絛約是也、乃希特勒旣追述該國迭次片面廢止條約之所為、其對於凡爾賽和約第二百卅一條、卽確定德國應負歐戰戎首之責任者、又復加以破壞、然則各國對於該國簽字之價值、安能加增信用心’、所幸希氏演詞中、亦有數段屬於積極性質、尤其是關於軍縮一段、希氏主張務當通盤加以考慮、俾時局得以綏靖、各國關係得以相互接近、特此種努力未可以對抗任何國為條件耳、余此言乃指蘇聯而言、緣該國擁有兩萬萬人口、兹若將該國人民擯諸國際團體之外、其事匪特失之武斷抑足引起危險、又况該國旣無擯棄他國之意、其需要和平、亦不必後於他人歟、‘余意各國軍事工業、務當改為承平時代之工業、此在各國、實有採取共同行動之必要、俾為軍事工業兌獲出路’要之、法國所不能為者、吾人亦不要求德國為之、‘至以西班牙內亂問題而論、苟有人焉、強令該國採用某種政制、實可引起重大之危機、該國究當採用何項政制、惟該國始得决定之、余望該國能以賢明態度出之、‘外長嗣又重行聲明、法國仍以國聯會為歸宿、並謂法士兩國關於叙利亞散嘉克區域所發生之爭議、困難實多、比經提付國聯行政院討論之後、業已順利解决、於以見國聯會機構、現仍具有實效、‘抑吾人自與其他愛好和平各國密切聯結之後、深覺一般和平與吾國安全、因而愈臻鞏固、吾國與英國邦交輯睦、其與小協商各國波關蘇俄各國所成立之協定、亦屬吾人有力之保障、可藉以制止戰事、加之美國民主政治基礎穩固、吾人在思想上與之搆成一體、亦有以維護和平’吾人深信戰爭非必不可避免、自當以全力招致訪解而有以避免戰禍、但吾人所抱和平志願亦有一種限度、卽吾國倘受他國攻擊、務當起而自衛、吾人所接受之義務務當信守不渝、此則吾人抱有决心而百折不撓者也、吾國自由強盛、對於本身實力與各國友誼均有切實把握、自可與各國握手言歡而無所疑懼、兹當陣亡將土紀念碑告成之日、謹遵先烈遺志、而為其後裔保全三種無上目標、卽祖國和平自由是也’云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>希特勒外交言論各國觀感不同</h3>
<p>英法失望羅馬贊同</p>
<p>［巴黎］關於德國希特勒元首在衆院發表之演説、各國方面評論不一、兹彙誌如下、</p>
<p>空泛不着邊際</p>
<p>倫敦　此間對於希特勒在衆院所發演説之印象、以為對於各事、不過予以寬限、並未有何推進、演説中所稱驚人事業時代業巳過去、固為人所樂聞、但合作時代似尚未開啟也、希氏之语氣、衆皆認為温魯、第其對於英外相艾登最近演説中關於歐洲總解決所舉各點之答言、似微覺空泛、例如艾登曾言今必須接受各國為有權利的之合組者、而希氏仍以不變的敵愾對付布爾希維克主義答之是、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］星期日出版各大報、卽星期秦晤士報與星期觀察報、頃評論德元首希特勒所發表之演説、咸以為英外相艾登與法總現前所提出各項問題、並未獲有答案、此層至為可惜、但國際談判門戶、並不因而關閉、則可引為滿意、並謂、世人對於歐洲時局之憂懼、亦可因而稍得安慰云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>前途一綫光明</p>
<p>巴黎　希特勒在衆院所發之演説、顯然為答覆法總理自倫近在里昂所發者、故須需審愼之研究、但今日法國皆以甚溫和之性情接受之、據法人之意、希氏之語調、較預先宣布者略見和緩、當能因此而使國際地位獲得澄清、法人所殷望之調整國際關係之切實建議、演説中固未見之、但希氏復重行聲明法德兩國間之怨惡業已消釋、此為法人所樂聞者、希氏宣布德國將不復作驚人之舉、而準備與歐洲合作、法人視以為演説中最光明之部分、按當薩爾區域交還時、德國曾向法國保證德國對法不再有土地之願望、今日希氏之言、殆向各國保證德國不欲對彼等之土地完整作何攻擊、例如德國不攻入米美爾、不佔據但澤是也、衆意此段演詞、顯足為前途希望中之一綫光明、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］此間對希特勒演詞之初步印象、可概述如下、</p>
<p>㊀法國方面原望英國外相艾登與法國白偷總理先後發表演説之後、希特勒元首當可切實有所答復、不料此次演詞仍屬不着邊際、並無何項切實的結論、㊁希特勒曾提及英外相艾登之演説、而對於自倫總理本月二十四日在里昂城所作演説、卽關於法德兩國在經濟上之合作者、則避不加以答復、此層未免可異、㊂希特勒元首演詞中戴段、對於法國措辭讓和、謂法政府與法駐德大使龐賽均具有忠誠、此外又曾提供保證、謂法德兩國間、現已不復有何爭執對象、凡此均使法國人士感覺滿意、㊃希特勒元首曾謂、一當在恢復平等權利範圍之內、改革德國各鐵路與德意志銀行之現行制度、而置諸德國政府主權之下云、此語眞正意義安在、尚不可知、但一般人以為當係德國行將再度出於片面行動、而將所負國際約束宣告廢止之徵、卽如凡爾賽和約第二百三十一條聲明、德國負歐戰戎首之責任、此層已由希特勒片面宣佈取銷、可為明證、關於希特勒建議比利時荷蘭兩國恢復歐戰前中立地位一層、一般人士極為注意、緣此項會議、對於未來羅卡諾公約、足以發生影響故也、㊅希特勒演詞中、關於蘇聯各節、足徵渠繼續主張摒除蘇聯、勿令參加歐洲時局一般解决方案、㊆關於殖民地方面、希特勒元首謂、各國中凡未奪取德國之殖民地者、德國不致向之要求殖民地云、此其用意、當指德國僅要求收回戰前殖民地、而並無覬覦葡萄牙屬殖民地之意、㊇關於西班牙問題、希特勒謂、德國在西班牙僅有商務上之利益云、以故西國內亂所釀成之國際時局、可望不致益臻嚴重云（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>與意政策吻合</p>
<p>羅馬　意大利政界對德元首希特勒之演説、完全贊同、認為可鞏固意德兩國所經營之眞正和平、並稱、希氏演説中所求獲得此種和平之各點、完全與意國政策相吻合、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］各報對于德元首演説、咸皆表示滿意、意大利日報名記者蓋達、并加以評論云、‘此項演詞發表之後、世人所抱各種幻想、已有一種歸于消滅、各國政府對于現實情形、亦因而認識較清、此于歐洲大局實大有裨益、至以德國政治傾向而論、主要動機三、厥在反對共產主義、似此、法俄兩國互助公約存在一日、則法德兩國相互接近之舉、卽一日不能實現’、此外關于殖民地問題、‘希特勒元首所言、乃係直接對于朋分德國舊殖民地之國、共兩國而發’、羅馬人民報載稱、英外相艾登前于本月十九日發表演説、諷示德國、謂苟能放棄大砲、卽可𢍉以牛油、希特勒元首乃于昨日加以答復、并‘指此為根本的謬誤、其意若日、德國固不欲陷于孤立、但亦無意解除武裝’、使者報則謂、‘此項演説內容溫和、形式亦復暢達、各種協定凡能以現實情形為基礎者、今後儘有成立之餘地矣’云、（卅一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>和約恥辱昭雪</p>
<p>柏林　希特勒元首之演説、各報均用大字標題登出之、或謂‘前政府在一九一八年十一月所簽之字、希特勒元首頃巳撤消之’、或謂‘德國應負歐戰責任之説、元首已鄭重予以否認’、或謂“德國在全世界之聲威、兹已重振”、各報主旨所在、乃希特勒元首有以雪凡爾賽和約之恥、此蓋解放德國民族之又一舉動、至其稱頌元首之處、較之日昨國社黨秉政四週年記念、尤有甚焉、例如當地指導報載稱、‘凡爾賽和約以桎梏加諸吾人、實乃歷史上之污點、希特勒元首兹乃滌而去之、其所採之决定與其所山之議動、均蒙上帝默佑而告成功、上帝所愛者乃勇敢之人也’、民衆觀察報載稱、’衆院因受元首偉大人格之感格、為之歡呼不已、今後德國乃可應付世界政治問題矣‘德意志總彙報載稱、’此項演詞發表之後、國際談判門戶於以開啟、元首所言、意義果何在歟、蓋卽吾國關於修改和約之主張、已告靜止是也’、外部機關報柏林交易所報載稱、‘吾人關於國民經濟所定辦法、實有必要、世人乃加以懷疑、欲妨碍吾國經濟之復興、希特勒元首爰乃以德國决心臨之、務欲賡續四年經濟計畫’云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>比國表示滿意</p>
<p>比京　比國半官界人士對於希特勒元首所稱、準備保障比國中立一節表示滿意、並謂德國宣佈取銷凡爾賽和約第二頁三十一絛（卽聲明德國係歐戰戎首之一條）之舉、僅係對內而發、並無多大闢係云、</p>
<p>離間英法企圖</p>
<p>波蘭　波蘭一般觀察家以為希特勒元首之演詞、幾係純粹對英國而發、而對於法國總理之演説則佯作不聞不問、此乃離間英法兩國之又一企圖、特英法兩國主張吻合無間、此與希特勒之主張大相逕庭、以故離間英法之企圖、必難成為事實也、</p>
<p>無稗和平事業</p>
<p>日內瓦　一般觀察家均採極端保留態度、間有認為失望者、緣希特勒演説內容並無建設性質之提議、徒將他國某某項建議加以拒絕、並就若干點加以肯定或否定、實僅係一種論戰而巳、對於和平事業實無所稗益、</p>
<p>歐局難望澄清</p>
<p>美國　美國半官界人士原望希特勒元首演詞中、含有安慰人心之表示、不料內容不着邊際、故多表示失望、並謂此項演詞、主旨係在對內、其對於凡爾賽和約所稱各節、均無多大關係、特在殖民地方面、德國現旣要求將戰前屬地悉數收回、則英德兩國實際上卽無成立妥協之可能、又希特勒對於蘇聯仍備加攻擊、則歐洲倘欲成立一般協定、而將東歐各國包含在內、其途徑已因之而閉塞、總之希特勒此項演詞發表之後、美國若干方面主張羅斯福總統出而參預歐洲事件者、仍將感覺不易入手也、（哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］英商相任錫曼與羅總統及國務總理赫爾最近在此間之討論、曾涉及殖民地原料重行分配之可能性、故德元首希特勒在衆院所發之演説、今日此間人士讀之尤為股切、官方對此默無一言、但國際界均表示失望、以為希氏與法總理自倫英外相艾登顯然不能協調、其中殊少共同合作之基礎、而希氏關於殖民問題之強硬態度、及對於英法交換意見之絕無讓步、皆令一般人為之扼腕、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>德國經濟病態</h3>
<p>整軍之自然結果　英雜誌發表論文</p>
<p>［倫敦］‘銀行家’雜誌二月號中、載有論文、批評德元首希特勒秉政四年以來德國之軍事財政及經濟情形、適於希氏在衆院演説之時出版、該刊謂德國之經濟病態、實為重整軍備之結果、且政府糜費之鉅遠過他國、更足增進此等病態云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<h3>希黨秉政紀念但澤盛大慶祝</h3>
<p>華沙　但澤自由市國社黨當局頃以盛大儀節、慶祝德國國社黨秉政四週年紀念、全城各處遍懸旗幟、國社黨各團體團員結隊遊行、柏林德衆院開會情形及希特勒元首演詞、均由無綫電播送此間、全城各工廠商店學校職員均就收音機恭聽、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>西班牙近畿戰事停頓</h3>
<p>西郊公園區域　叛軍反攻敗退</p>
<p>瑪德里　政府軍當局今午發表公報稱、本城西郊蒙克洛亞公園、昨經我軍規復之後、叛軍頃又猛烈進攻、企圖再度加以奪佔、當經政府軍迎頭痛聲、雙方鏖戰三小時後、叛軍終於敗退、損失甚鉅云、目前附郭一帶大雨如注、軍事行動業已為之停頓（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>從舌戰到總辭職</h3>
<p>— 東京通信</p>
<p>㊀</p>
<p>在日本議曾開會之前、誰都以為重要問題太多、自然不免若干波瀾、但最後不過對於增稅案及預算中軍備費以外的政費、加以幾許修正、可以無事渡過難關、但是廣田內閣因其閣內所包合之相尅性甚多、終是不能持久的、議會閉會後、難免辭職、誰知道議會開會第一天、因為濱田與寺內辯駁是否侮辱軍部問題、引起議會停會兩天又引起可否解散議會問題、因為閣內意見不一致、復引起內閣總辭職的巨浪、這一幕連環劇、决不是偶然的、也不是個人的意氣、純粹是日本數年來思想對立的結果、兩種不相容的思想、互相摩擦太厲害了、當然要爆發的、可以説是社會的必然性、但是誰也想不到這麼快就爆發了、這兩種思想是什麼呢、簡單的説、就是自由主義與統制主義的衝突、這次議會、無論民政黨與政友會、都沒有推翻廣田內閣的計劃與决、心濱田的演説、也不過説其所要説而已、措辭本來很愼重、他本人决想不到會引起這麼大的風波、寺內對於濱田的演説、假使本來沒有不滿的意思、也不會就發生侮辱的感想、天下事眞是凑巧、剛剛頭一天、兩大政黨的黨大會的宣言、都沒有提到充實國防的必要、而同時對於現內閣施政、都是採取批評與攻擊的態度、所以陸軍方面首先發表談話、説是兩黨對於時局的認識非常缺乏、不足以共負非常時的重責、如果兩黨要反對政府、請先撤回黨出身的閣員、這種表示非常重大、任何方面、都非常重視、我們就感覺得陸軍與政黨間的摩擦面、必然要擴大的、但還沒想到立刻就可以引起這麼大的政潮、陸軍方面、有此不滿、所以濱田演説就好像把導火綫點了火一樣、立刻爆發了、</p>
<p>㊁</p>
<p>那一天衆議院開會時、記者幸有旁聽的機會、自廣田首相演説以迄濱田與寺內的舌戰、全劇都目擊了、廣田首相的演説、等於把演稿朗誦一遍、使我們感覺得他不但沒有自信力、而且缺乏魄力、以與原敬·加籐·高明比較、實在差得太遠、有田外相的演説、時受臺下的揶揄有一位中立的議員田淵豊吉、倚老賣老、時時大聲喊叫‘你不要瞎説了、怏滾下去罷、’有田説到‘中日交涉還沒有得到預期的效果、’臺下為之哄笑、又説到‘月下在停頓狀態之中、’臺下又大呼‘不是失敗了罷、’再説到‘到現在所交涉的、與將來展開、有甚大的意義、’臺下復為之譁然、有田説到對蘇外交、臺下也大呼‘悲慘的外交失敗、’説到對美外交日增親善、臺下又大喊‘不要瞎説’、終有田一塲演説、只有罵聲並無掌聲、這是為歷來國務大臣演説所沒有的現象、馬塲財相演説歷舉數字説明對於發行公債的限度、對於增稅與國民負擔力，都沒有確然自信的斷語、所以臺下一聲掌聲也沒有、在此種形勢之下、議員的心理、可以思過半了、三位大臣演説之後民政黨代表櫻內幸雄首先質問櫻內演説甚長、每遇重要處民政黨當然鼓掌、政友會方面、也時時有掌聲、廣田·有田·馬塲·的答辯都不過是應付而已、我們旁聽的人、都不感覺得滿意何况議員、第二陣的質問者、便是政友會的老鬥將濱田國松、濱田本來是犬養毅的老政友、與犬養同時加入政友會的、濱田的質問、首先對於三位大臣對櫻內答辯、加以非難、説從來國務大臣的答辯、沒有這樣不誠懇、首從廣田內閣的無力不得不依賴軍部做推進力攻擊起、舌鋒漸漸轉到軍人要談政治、應該脫下軍服卸下軍刀、組織政黨、在言論上作戰、濱田復就壓迫言論這一點滔滔不絕的、進攻廣田內閣、又引據憲法及明治遺訓、發揮議會政治·政黨政治·的眞髓、抨擊官僚政治·獨裁政治·的橫行每到要害處、台下掌聲雷動記者轉看閣員態度、則廣田·寺內·有田·馬塲·都忙於筆記質問要點、尤以寺內的眼光注視濱田、好像很焦急的樣子、</p>
<p>㊂</p>
<p>濱田一小時半的長演説、好容易完了、廣田首先答辯、對於獨裁政治·力加辯明、説是‘現內閣萬機皆决諸公論’、台下為之大笑其次便是此次政變的主人翁寺內陸相、寺內登壇首説‘我國的政治形態、總理大臣已經充分説明了’台下對於‘充分’二字，為之哄然、正在此際、寺內仍忘却以下應該如何答辯、急以手招梅津次官、梅津授以字片、始繼續説下去寺內説到‘剛纔聽見濱田君的演説、對於軍人有點……’稍為停頓、才説出‘侮蔑’二字、這兩字剛出口、台下大呼‘NoNo’並且羣喊‘趕快取消’、寺內幾乎因為台下的喊聲、不能發言、好容易又説兩句、趕緊説‘我現在不多説了’、寺內下去有田上來答辯、台下的注意、已完全移到‘侮蔑’兩字、有田説甚麼也不關心了、有田説完濱田又登壇再質問、手指寺內請問、‘剛纔你説濱田演説中、有侮辱軍部的話、究竟那一句話是侮辱、’台下鼓掌、‘我是國民的代表、若説我侮辱國家名譽的軍隊、就是打架的話、我也不肯退、（台下掌聲又起）説我侮辱、必須舉出事實若用抽象的言語、我不懂、’氣焰萬丈、旁聽者也為之揑一把汗、這時寺內的臉、好像柿子一樣、復起答稱、‘我沒有説侮辱、請看速記錄、説到這裏、台下譁然、’我説濱田君所用的語辭、使人聽着、有侮辱的感覺、所以忠告濱田君、‘濱田是一位七十老翁、在政界是老將、那肯放鬆、又登壇反駁説、’我不能受年青的人的忠告你是陛下的陸軍大臣、但是國家的公務員、我雖不肖、也是陛下的公務員若由封建思想官僚獨善主義看來、你是官史、我是百姓、但是我是有九千萬人民做後盾的公務員、如果受你的忠告、那麼我非對天下敬謝不敏不可、日本武士、從古尊重名譽與士道、可以亳無論據、亳無事實、斷定人家的不名譽嗎、請調看速記録、如果我有侮辱軍隊的話、我當切腹以謝君、沒有的話、你當切腹以謝天下、‘濱田説時、台下掌聲、幾未中斷、寺內情感作用、更覺難堪、最後寺內仍請待調看速記錄再説、而濱田也因每一議員質問、只限三次、所以勉強中止舌戰、誰知道這幾分鐘的辯駁、當夜就引起停會的風波、與內閣的總辭職呢、</p>
<p>㊃</p>
<p>衆議院散會時、已經六時二十分了、我們回家打電報、以為明天還可以看看這幕喜劇究竟怎麼收束、誰知道到夜半就接到停會的消息、原來衆議院散會後、寺內要求廣田召集緊急閣議在閣議席上、寺內如何主張閣員如何討論、我們自然不得而知、但是據説、寺內以為今日議會空氣、甚為險惡、各政黨對於時局重大性、並無感覺、若不促其反省、恐怕可以激起極大風潮、主張立刻解散議會、閣員中有以這事太重大、不可輕易决定、况且議會剛開會一天、一切尚未討論、解散、未免太無理由、所以折衷結果先行停會兩天再作計議、二十一夜决定停會、二十二日下午召集緊急閣議、討論停會後辦法、聞當時寺內仍力主解散、如其主張不能通過、卽當單獨辭職、並將辭呈面交廣田、在此局勢之下欲避內閣互解的危機、只可先决定解散議會方針、再圖補救、其實當决定解散方針時、有一部閣員已經有妥協的企圖、尤以永野海相希望在太平洋無條約的第一年、就可以實現充實與擴充海軍的大計劃、所以對於解散議會、不以為然、而小川商相、也因為站在民政黨黨員的立塲、不能不努力阻止解散所以閣議雖然决定了解散的方針、這兩位忽然於深夜訪問民政黨町田總裁、陳述斡旋妥協的意思、永野又單獨訪問政友會鈴木總裁、縷述他的意見、兩大政黨本來沒有倒閣的意思、永野旣然出頭調停、當然表示同感、但因為黨的關係、請待翌朝再行答覆、同時各方面當然也有同樣的工作不在話下、這一夜的調停的工作、第二天妥協的空氣突趨濃厚、到了廿二日的上午兩大政黨正式答覆接受調停、於是最後的關鍵、就只在陸軍的態度如何了、我們在這裏、應該發生幾個疑問、第一、妥協工作、事前是否得了寺內的同意、第二、妥協的條件是什麼第三、妥協之後、陸軍與黨政的摩擦是否可以緩和、對於第一個疑問、我們的推測、是負的方面因為寺內態度始終是强硬的、二十二日已提出辭職書斷無贊成的道理、不過閣員中、以為政黨如肯妥協、寺內或不至强硬反對、姑且試一試、第二個疑問我們推測永野所提妥協條件、大約是要兩大政黨表明不推翻現內閣並日保證通過預算、則政府取消解散議會的預定計劃、這種觀察、雖不中也不遠了第三個疑問、我們想從事妥協工作的閣員不過希望頂算通過以後、摩擦是否可以緩和、暫時恐怕不在考慮之中、</p>
<p>㊄</p>
<p>廿三早、舉世視綫都集中在陸軍方面、但是陸軍巳於廿二日深夜發表拒絕茍且妥協的聲明書、依然堅持當初方針誓不與旣成政黨合作、所以廿三早、陸軍召集三長官會議、决定澈底排擊政黨的態度、海軍也召集軍事參議官會議、决定支持永野調停方針遙遙相對、眞是妙極、陸海兩方幹部往來、雖然非常之多、但是最重要的永野與寺內單獨會見、始終不能實現、所以到了二十三日上午十時左右、大家知道妥協是絕對無望了、妥協不能成功則解决時局、只剩兩個途徑、內閣總辭職呢、議會解散呢、按照政治常軌説、解散議會、實在不近情理、第一、議會對於內閣並無不信任决議、一個議員演説、不能斷定全體態度、第二、現內閣在議會中、並無一個與黨、卽使解散現內閣並無勝利的希望、形勢非常明顯、不必待總選舉結果而後知、第三、所有政策問題、尚未討論、政府以何題目徵求民意、有此三因、如果妥協工作不能成功、那麼內閣總辭職是最正當的辦法、我們當初就是這樣觀察、但是廣田內閣、忽然决定解散方針、令人有莫明其妙的感想、難道運用政治、日本人有特別的技術麼、自從永野挺身担任調停工作失敗以後、大家知道雖有兩個解决途徑、但解散這一條路綫是走不通了、閣員意見不一致、只有總辭職、並且举国輿論、對於解散、都認不是辨法、在此雰圍之中、寺內雖然强硬主張、但是不贊成的閣員、也斷不能改變態度、廣田本來也感覺自己無力、在此千鈞一髮的關頭、更難统一閣员的步骤、所以在二十三日上午、廣田已經决定辭職了、等到下午一時半召集緊急閣議的時候、廣田為避免閣員衝突計、先行個別接見、告以决心、所以最重大的閣議、只費了二十分鐘的時間、决定總辭職了、閣員辭職理由有三種、這是向來所沒有的、廣田的理由、是‘鑒於最近政情、施政更加困難殊難期其圓滑’、寺內的理由、是‘對於現在政情不滿、其他閣員的理由、是為總理辭職而辭職一、這種表示方法、是很可注目的、</p>
<p>㊅</p>
<p>這次政變之中、我們最可重視的、有幾件事、第一、日本陸軍、為什麼這樣排擊旣成政黨、旣成政黨的短處、人所周知的、但在現行憲法之下、議會是要尊重的、運用議會的機構當然要靠政黨的、排擊旣成政黨、則今後政治如何應用呢、我們知道陸軍方面、也知道非靠政黨不能實現强有力的政治、但是旣成政黨依然以自由主義為指導精神、與陸軍所懷抱的統制主義、根本不能相容所謂統制主義、陸軍雖然否認卽是法西斯主義、但是這種印象是很深的、所以這次政變可以説是自由主義與統制主義的正面鬥爭的開始、第二、日本海軍的政治信念、在或種程度以內、是與陸軍不同的、陸軍主張解散、海軍主張妥協、這是很明顯的對立、今後政治上所表現的、陸軍與海軍的主張、是否是永遠對立的值得我們重視、海軍中的自由主義者、似乎還不少、第三、陸軍與旣成政黨形成不兩立的形態那麼、今後如何袖救呢組織新黨、當然是一條出路但是這樣大事業、談何容易、即使從旣成政黨中、可以吸收若干人數、欲得多數、實在不易、右翼團體結成一黨、又似緩不濟急、何以故呢、因為旣成政黨的地盤、都是經過幾十年的培養、彼此間縱有消息、新黨欲圖侵入、太不容易、我們且看他們錦囊中有何妙計、（一月二十四日中央社）</p>

<h3>辦“留東新聞”張健冬簡泰梁王瑞符被逐回國昨抵滬</h3>
<p>駐日大使館正準備抗議　張等擬在滬或京籌復刊</p>
<p>因主辦留東新聞致遭日當局驅逐回國之該刊總經理張健冬、總編輯簡泰梁、編輯王瑞符、業於昨日下午一時半、乘日郵阿蘇丸抵滬、在滬留日同學及三君親友、均赴匯山碼頭歡迎、卽由留日同學邀至福州路大觀樓歡宴、現三君暫寓友人處、定日內晋京向政府報告、新聲社記者昨特訪晤三人、據告經過情形甚详、兹分誌如次、</p>
<p>創刊動機</p>
<p>吾人因鑒於留日學生達七八千人、華僑達四五萬人、日本報章、受政府之統制、缺乏眞實報導、關於我國消息、尤多不實紀載、余等為報告祖國正確消息於華僑學生、介紹日本政治情形於國內、溝通中日文化、爰集資在東京創辦‘留東新聞’週刊、自前年六月十二日創刊、宗旨純正、毫無政治關係、黨派背景當時曾得日外務省內務省及我駐日使館留學生監督署等各機關許可、日本各報、亦一致同情譽為留日中國人唯一乏與論、初時對政治外交、鮮有登載、旋覺茍忽略政治外交新聞、殊與創刊意義背馳、逐漸乃對政治外交消息、增加紀載、至第四期後、日當局卽取干涉態度、時受檢查、監察綦嚴、支持至第九期、為鞏固基礎起見、曾經依照日本出版法、正式繳納保證金、向日政府備案、同時呈准我國中宣部登記、發給登記證、</p>
<p>被捕經過</p>
<p>自是以後、日當局仍吹毛求疵、時以文字或標題等瑣屑問題、或加警告、或被沒收、統計截至第五十九期止、其間被沒收者、不下十餘次之多、極盡威脅能事迫去年十二月間、吾人承日友見告、此次日本國會開會日軍部少壯派軍人、擬大施脅迫進一步申張其勢力、該部對留東新聞、尤表不滿、果爾、非但刊物被停卽主辦人生命、亦有危險、於是吾等三人、曾一度回國、本月十三日得返東京、翌晨九時、突有警視廳外事科亞細亞系、派探員至新聞社搜查、所有文件、悉被搜括以去、此外李仲平、呂奎文、簡柏村、三君、亦同遭被捕、解神田錦町警察所、在東京我國官民聞訊、無不憤慨、當日我駐日大使館、卽派秘書沈提、留日學生監督署派總務科長蔣君輝、馳赴警視廳、提出交涉、要求立卽繹放、一面許大使電外交部中宣部、陳次溥監督電教育部、分別報告請示、留日學生、亦紛紛至警所慰問、設法營救、</p>
<p>被逐回國</p>

<h3>華北棉花與日本紡織工業</h3>
<p>— 鄧葆光</p>
<p>㊀日本紡織工業之現狀</p>
<p>日本的紡織工業，自一八六七年島津齊杉在鹿兒島創設紡紗工廠以來，到現在僅僅六十九年間短短的歷史，但已經成為日本的基本工業了。現在全國的紡織公司凡七十四社，紡織工廠凡二百五十六廠，投資總額達七億元，紡紗錠數達千萬枚，織機總數達三十七萬六千餘臺，棉紗生產量年達三百五十餘萬包，棉布输出额年達二十七億餘萬平方碼。</p>
<p>備考（A）公司工廠單位為個，紡錠單位千枚，織機單位千台，棉紗生產量單位千，棉布輸出量單位。萬平方碼。</p>
<p>（B）額定資本，據財政經濟時報社調查，現有七十四公司總資本額為五億九千一百萬元，其他小企業工廠約一億元，據此合共不下七億元。</p>
<p>（C）一九三五年織機總額二十七萬七千台中，廣幅力織機為二十四萬一千台，小幅力織機為七萬九千九百台，手織為五萬五千五百台。織機總數自一九一八年至現在雖只增加一萬二千台，廣幅織機却增加十一萬二千台。小幅織機减少三萬台，手織機减少七萬台。這實質上的變化，證明日本的織布工業，第一種意義，是由舊式的生產方式，轉入新的生產過程，故手織機年年减少。第一種意義，自日本內地市塲為目標的發展形態上，漸漸以世界市塲為目標，故廣幅織機增加一倍，輸出棉布額增加十倍，同時反映着日本內地的棉布市塲日趨狹小——國民購買力薄弱，不然，則小幅織機，不會减少，蓋日本衣服原料，皆為小幅布也。</p>
<p>一九三四年，日本工業生產總值九十四億元中，紡織工業品達十五億元，佔總額一五·七％。全日本工塲勞動者二百十六萬三千人中，從事紡織工業者五十六萬二千人，佔總額三四·八％·一九三五年日本輸出貿易總值二十四億八千萬元中，紡織工業品達五億九千萬元，佔總額二三·六％。</p>
<p>備考　生產額及輸出貿易額，單位百萬元，勞働者單位千人。</p>
<p>一九三五年，世界棉布輸出額五十八億八千萬平方碼中，日本輸出者，達二十億二千五百萬平方碼，佔總額四八％，奪取了大英帝國的棉業王位，奪取了大英帝國的獨佔市塲，造成了極深刻的日英經濟衝突。</p>
<p>備考　有×印者為推定數，單位百萬平方碼。</p>
<p>前述的三種事實，以及三種表格，證明日本的紡織工業，在日本的工業經濟上，牢牢地佔着工業王位，在日本國際貿易上，以及國際棉布輸出貿易上，也是佔着第一王位。在一九一三年——歐戰前時代，大英帝國支配下的世界棉布市塲，今已被日本爭奪殆盡，默然思之，殊不勝為英人起今昔之感也。</p>
<p>㊁日本紡織工業之發展過程</p>
<p>日本的紡織工業，在短短的六十九年的歷史中，奪取了世界棉業王位，發展之速，實可驚人，因之其發展的過程，為什麼有這般順利？其發展速度，為什麼有若是的快疾？自然，有他的背景和原因。</p>
<p>當明治維新時代的日本社會因其政治之紛亂，與夫社會經濟之不安，幾乎將跟着中國的衰落而淪為次殖民地了。當時，大量的西洋貨物輸入，使日本固有的家庭工業，陷於不可復生的深淵。雖經維新政府，對外貨銳意防止，對國貨竭力提倡，但非短時間所能收効，至明治十年，棉織物輸入額達八千九百六十萬元，佔輸入總值三六％。是後西南戰役平定，政治漸趨統一，產業開發，亦漸收功，明治十一年，選定全國二十五區為棉花生產地，同時政府出資向英國購買紡織機械四千枚，十二年又放出大量的企業資金，購二千枚之紡織機械十組，十三·十四兩年，又貸與大量資金，十年無息，分期償還，民間購買紡織機械之欵項，由政府貸付，經過此多次直接援助後，至明治十四年底，紡織工塲達十七，紡紗錠數達五萬九千枚。十九年，更施行關稅保護政策，二十七年，廢止棉紗輸出稅，二十九年，撤收棉花輸入稅，自是，日本初期的紡織工等基礎，漸形穩固矣。</p>
<p>明治二十七年，跟着日本經濟發展而來的中日戰爭爆發。這次戰爭，是日本資本主義一個劃時代的發展。紡織工業，自明治二十七年至三十一年間，紡織公司由四十五增至七十四，紡織工塲，由四十五增至七十七，紡織錠由五十三萬枚增至百十四萬六千枚，棉紗生產額由二十九萬一千包增至六十四萬四千包。</p>
<p>戰神，是日本資本主義的恩人，中日之戰以後，接着日俄之戰，更接着世界大戰。中日·日俄·兩次戰爭，日本佔領了朝鮮及中國市塲，中日戰後，日本輸入朝鮮及我東北之棉布，達三百三十萬元，日俄戰後，增達千四百萬元，一九一四年，日本輸入中國的棉紗，達五十七萬包的空前紀録。世界大戰爆發後，日本又乘機奪取了印度及南洋羣島等英國所獨佔的棉布市塲，一九一四年，日本棉織物輸出額四千三百萬元，一九一九年增達三億五千餘萬元。僅歐戰數年中，其增加率達五倍。</p>
<p>一九二九年，世界經濟大恐慌襲來，日本又乘機奪取東北，更欲利用其一切優越條件，支配整個的中國。更利用其對外匯價之低落，勞働條件的惡劣，及產業合理化等利器，乘機席捲了世界棉布市塲。</p>
<p>日本自一九三一年再度施行通貨膨胀政策以來，對外匯價步步低落，至現在止，已跌落至一六○％，因此，一九三二年棉布輸出額自一億九千八百萬元，至一九三五年增達五億九千萬元。</p>
<p>關於日本勞働條件惡劣問題，在一九三三年國際勞働會議時，英美等國，曾提出社會傾銷問題，以圖提高日本勞働階級的生活絛件，而壓抑日本紡織工業之飛躍發展，然而這實際問題，决不是空虛的國際會議所能解决的。若拿列國勞働者一週所得的工資作比較，則美國為三十五元，英國十八元，德國十三元，日本僅五元八十錢，因之。貨物的生產費，有如下的比率。</p>
<p>明白的説，日本棉紗生產費需要百元的塲合，則美國要三百七十六元，英國要二百三十八元，德國要一百九十二元，這是日本勞慟條件低下的持徵，也就是日本紡織工業在世界經濟恐慌過程突飛猛進的一大因素。</p>
<p>關於產業合理化與日本紡織工業發展的關係，一九三四年十月富土紡織公司專務鹿村姜久氏在京商工會議所講“日本棉業之優越性”，是一篇典型的報告：</p>
<p>‘合理化的結果，我國（日本）紡織工業的生產費非常賤，職工减少，紡錠一萬枚的職工，在一九二九年六月，男工六十一人，平均日給一元六十錢，女工二百十八人，平均日給一元三十七錢，至一九三三年十二月，男工减至二十七人，日給一元三十七錢，女工减至百六十二人，日給七十七錢，佔棉織物原價半倍的生產費，减低五五％，這是我國（日本）紡織工業發展的武器。’</p>
<p>備考　工人的單位人，工資的單位元。</p>
<p>總合上述的各種事實，日本紡織工業飛躍發展的原因有五。㊀政府的助長政策；㊁戰後的刺激及一般產業的發展；㊂對外匯價低落；㊃勞働條件低下；㊄產業合理化。</p>
<p>㊂日本紡織工業與國際貿易之依存性</p>
<p>日本的紡織工業，雖然是高速度的發展着，但其前途殊有不勝隱憂者。原來日本的紡織工業品，不僅要向外國竭力銷售，就是紡織工業品原料——棉花，也有百分之九九要抑給於外國的供給，因此，日本的紡織工業，與國際貿易之依存性，亦特別重大。</p>
<p>一九三五年，日本輸出貿易額二十四億八千萬元中，棉織物輸出達五億九千萬元，佔總額二三％。總輸入貿易額，二十三億四千萬元中，棉花輸入達七億一千四百萬元，佔總額三○％。</p>
<p>棉織物在輸出貿易上，棉花在輸入貿易上，都霸佔了最重要的地位，這誠然足以證明日本紡織工業與國際貿易的依存性之特別重大，但同時觀察日本紡織工業的本身上，也表示着特殊依重的傾向。一九三五年。日本棉織生產總額八億七千六百萬元中，棉織物輸出額達五億九千萬元，佔總生產額六八％。一九三五年，日本棉花總消費量一千二百五十二萬担中，自己所有者，僅朝鮮生產之十六萬七千担而已，仰給於外國輸入者，達一千二百三十五萬三千担，因是日本棉織物生产總額八億七千六百萬元，而棉花输入额達七億一千四百萬元。更簡單的説，棉織物生產額，在日本內地所消費者，僅三二％，輸出於外國者，達六八％，日本棉花消費額，自己所有者，僅一四％，仰給於外國輸入者，達九八·六％。</p>
<p>備考棉織物生產與消費關係單位百萬元，棉花消費</p>
<p>與供給關係，單位千担，</p>
<p>關於棉織物的生產和消費問題，在此再不多談，今更詳述日本的棉花供給問題。</p>
<p>日本棉花的輸入額，一九三五年，一千二百二十八萬三千担，七億一千四百萬元中，自美國输入者，佔五百七十五萬八千担，合三億七千二百萬元，自印度輸入者，佔五百二十一萬一千担，合二億五千九百萬元，自埃及輸入者，五十三萬七千担，合四千二百萬元，自中國輸入者，佔四十二萬七千担，合二千萬元，其他如非洲棉·南貢棉·朝鮮棉·巴西·秘魯·土耳其·波斯等棉，約三十五萬擔，合一千九百五十餘萬元。這就是説，日本所用的棉花有四七％仰給於美國，有四三％仰給於印度，其餘則仰給於中國棉及埃及棉補充。</p>
<p>備考　數量單位担，價額單位千工人。</p>
<p>日本的紡織工業。在國際貿易的盛衰下支配着，日本的国際貿易，在世界和平的前提下支配着，一旦國際發生變化，日本的國際貿易，首先受到威脅，日本的紡織工業，也就立刻，發生動搖，故自一九二九年世界經濟恐慌以來，日本的棉花國策論，市塲確保論，高唱入雲，至今更熾。</p>
<p>前回説過了，日本所用的棉花，有四七％要仰給於美國，有四三％要仰給於印度，其餘則仰給於中國和埃及棉的補充。可是，現階段上之日美關係，非常危險，日英的衝突，也一天一天的深沉，印度排斥日貨，日本以不買印棉為要　，棉花來源的前途，也非常危險，故日本棉花的需要以美印為依賴，在日本資本主義的發展上，是一種極大的損害，特別自九一八以來，軍需工業飛躍的發展，棉花是製造火藥的原料，較之鋼鐵的需求，更還迫切，因是日本朝野高喊着棉花國策問題。</p>
<p>誰都知道，英國之把持印度和埃及，是因為有大量的棉產，大有補助於蘭開夏的棉產，使其减少對美棉之依賴。在平時可以平均國內產業之需求，在戰時可以作軍需工業的原料。在歐戰時，德國曾用武力奪取外國原棉，並發現人造棉花，到現在，對於棉花生產的獎勵與夫原棉生產地之掠奪，這是同樣的非常注意。意大利之奪取阿比西尼亞，也是因其土地氣候之宜於植棉。日本佔領朝鮮後，曾提倡植棉，但其產額，僅能供給百分之一·四而已，佔領滿洲後，也同樣施行植棉計劃，但以氣候及地質關係，都歸失敗。中國，是世界第三大棉產國，有適於植棉的氣候和土質，且中日之地理經濟關係，又若是之鄰近而密切，而華北各省，為中國棉產區之冠，故近年日本的植棉計劃，又轉到華北來了。</p>
<p>日本要施行棉花國策計劃，奪取棉花供給地，在平時可以平均國內產業的需求，在戰時可以作為軍需品之原料，為减少其對於美印棉花之依賴，及英美之威脅，故急謀奪取“華北棉區一，而造成一個，日本支配下的東印度”。</p>
<p>㊃華北棉花之生產狀况</p>
<p>世界棉花最大的生產國，為美國，次為印度，中國佔第三位。若中國棉花能人盡其才，地盡其利，則將來生產量增加，或凌駕美印之上，亦未可知。</p>
<p>中國棉花生產額，據今年的佔計，豐收一千五百萬担。據二十四年中華棉業聯合會統計報告，收穫額為九百八十萬担，二十三年為一千三百四十萬担，據各年統計，中國棉花生產額，將在一千萬担與一千五百萬担之間。</p>
<p>中國棉花產地，大體上分黃河流域及長江流域兩大棉區，長江流域中之產棉省分，厥為湖北·湖南·江西·安徽·江蘇·浙江六省，黃河流域則為河北·山東·山西·河南·陝西·五省。今吾人所欲討論者，僅以黃河流域為限，因地理關係，屬於所謂華北範圍。</p>
<p>華北因地勞高亢，目地質多為冲積士與黃土合成之混合砂土，最適宜於種植棉花，而黃河沿岸的土質，含有石灰質最多，故為栽培美棉的最良區域。因此自然條件約優異，故華北棉田的生產力，為長江流域的任何省分所不能及，歷年平均每畝棉田的皮棉收穫量，河北達三十斤，山西·山東達二十六斤，較全國歷年平均每畝收穫量，多出百分之十六，若合成公畝，則每一畝的皮棉產額，在二百磅以上，皆爲美印棉之所不能及也。</p>
<p>因為華北有優良的植棉條件，故華北的棉花，早為華北數省中最大的農產物，在全中國棉產比率中，也把握着重地位。據民國二十年統計，河北的棉產額為百萬擔，至三十三年增至三百三十八萬五千擔，二十四年减至二百五十八萬六千擔，山東省·自二百五十九万擔，减至一百五十九萬擔，山西自九萬七千擔，增至七十一萬七千擔，河南自七十一萬九千擔，增至百二十二萬擔，陝西自四十一萬三千擔，增至百十九萬八千擔。棉花耕作地，也是年有增加，尤以山西·陝西為最速，僅山東時受黃河汜濫，未能順利耕作，故棉花耕作面積，及棉花產額，皆年有减少，但華北全盤合算依然年有增加。</p>
<p>華北棉花，現在年產額雖只八八百萬擔，（二十三年）但其前途大有希望，據中國棉業統制委員會華北視察員李叔伯氏説，華北棉產五年之內，可以增加一倍，亦卽全國所需要的紡織原料可以達到自給自足之程度。五年以後，中國棉產可以輸出，在國際貿易上佔得重要地位。祇要中央與各省政府能於水利上為農民謀灌溉之道，則此項計劃，甚易成功。（見民國十四年一月九日天津大公報載北平通信）。又據日本外務省調查部出版之華北農村救濟與棉業改進一書中，大原實氏之調查，謂河北·山東兩省，如以二十年之時間，擴張植棉面積至四千三百萬畝時，則所產棉花達十五億斤，對於日本的紡織工業，有極重大的意義。</p>
<p>就華北棉花的品質言，亦在長江流域之上。河北省南御河棉，可紡十六支以上之棉紗，西河棉富有彈性，適於毛棉交織之用，在近代軍需工業原料上為製造火藥之用。東北棉織維細長，宜於中等紗之紡織。河南靈寶棉，為全國棉產中品質之最佳者，可作三十二支以上的原料，堪與美棉相對敵，山東棉最適宜於紡織，迈年的美種棉花，可以代替美棉之用，其他僅山西棉，品質較劣耳。近年各地設有棉花檢騐局，取締一般小販商人才攙水來雜等不良習慣，此於將來中國棉業改良工作上，有重大意義。總之，華北棉花若能利用其優美的天然環境，則將來必為最優美品質的棉花，無論作為紡織原料，或作為軍需工業及其他原料，華北棉花，在未來的價值上，愈益顯其珍貴了。</p>
<p>㊄結論</p>
<p>日本是需要棉花的國家，華北棉花的前途，在各方面都大有希望，且就地理上説，僅一海之隔，比美印之遠渡重洋，在時間上，運費上，皆為五與一之比，且在國際關係上，與其倚賴於美印，不若倚賴華北之為穩當，因是日本紡織工業，為取得紡織原料計，日本軍需工業，為取得製造軍火的原料計，華北棉花與日本的關孫，在現今已漸漸地嚴重起來。</p>
<p>日本用何種計劃奪取華北棉花，就日本近年進攻華北的一貫政策上看來大概可分三個步驟，㊀積極提倡種植棉花，改良棉種，提高品質：㊁增設棉花販賣綱，使大批的棉花，能集中於日人的掌握中；㊂直接用武力政策，政治手段，奪取棉產區。</p>
<p>第一種，一九三四年上季，日本卽開始實施華北戰區各縣的植棉計劃，决定以耕地三千頃，由日本大阪興業公司，以資本百萬元辦理。去年該公司已設立一植棉委員會，並設有盧龍·豊潤·遵化，遷安·密雲·等十餘縣的分會·同時在山東組織山東棉花改良協會，曾要求山東省政府准其在張店及鄰近十餘縣植棉。又如最近興中公司所提倡的華北棉花改良及增種等計劃。總之，這不過表示日本進取華北棉花的初步姿勢而已。</p>
<p>第二種，天津七天紗廠，已經完全入於日本手中者有五廠，其他廠，亦在其支配之下，最近日本各大紡織公司如鐘淵·大日本東洋等一流紡織廠，皆虎視耽耽的注視華北，如東棉·內外·大康·上海·等對於華北的販賣網，早已散開，嚴陣以待的等着，以圖一網打盡，同時擬築津石鐵道以求運輸上之便利，並擬在天津青島設棉花交易所，以圖集中華北棉化，很快的送到日本。</p>
<p>第三種，自塘沾協定及華北事變以來，以至最近之所謂華北問題，利用其優越的政治軍事機能，圖一手掠奪華北，最近一鬆一弛的緩遠問題，也是包圍華北的一種軍事計劃。</p>
<p>總之，日本掠奪華北棉區計劃，已經跟着國際關係的緊張，而愈益嚴重起來，被掠奪的人們，還能坐以待斃嗎？</p>
<h3>南洋棉布市塲之探討</h3>
<p>— 高事恒</p>
<p>一，南洋棉布市塲之分配　　南洋各地分為五大區城，卽美屬菲律濱，荷屬東印度，英屬馬來亞，法屬安南，及暹羅。除暹羅為獨立國外，其他均為白種人之殖民地，各有其立塲與背景，用不同之方法，處理其進口貿易，其目的在作為母國工業品之尾閭則一也。各地之輸入，均以棉布占第一位，除菲律濱與暹羅可以自由輸入外，英屬馬來亞與荷屬東印度均有限制，法屬安南則一以高稅率保護法國眞品之優勢，其餘各國貨物進口極少。據一九三五年全南洋之棉布輸入，折合國幣為一萬八千四百六十三萬三千七百五十元，日本貨佔最大多數，達一萬萬元，中國貨占最少數僅三百萬元弱。據一九三四年中國輸入馬來亞僅國幣二，○五三，六八四元，日本輸入合國幣五，一四二，○二八元，暹羅方面，中國輸入三○，○三八元，日本輸入一○，五九三，六五二元。日本貨以價廉勝，歐美貨常較一倍以上，惟中國貨價介乎兩者之間，故亦惟貴中國貨尚可與日本貨相競爭。</p>
<p>二，華僑經營棉布業之勢力</p>
<p>南洋人口一萬二千四百萬，華僑佔六百五十萬。如新加坡全人口五十四萬，而華僑佔四十萬，曼谷人口五十萬，而華僑佔三十萬以上，西貢三十餘萬人口中，有華僑十二萬，所至各地無不見國旗與華僑經營事業。在棉布市塲中尤佔極大勢力。僅荷屬印度進口商，大部分為歐人操縱而已。其他各地批發零售無不由華僑經營。年來因國貨未嘗向南洋推銷，致若輩咸成為日貨之推鎖員。日人在南洋不但派遺代表考察調查，且其同業之進行，完全為整個的，其後盾為政府，為國內整個的工商界，利用其本國航輪的低廉運費，國家銀行的低利匯票，以之在南羊競爭，遂所向無敵，華僑旣無國貨可營，又不能經營歐美貨，自惟以日貨為對像，再復數年，國產棉布必且絕路於南洋，殆無疑義。急起直追，挽此頹勢，是所望於國內棉紡織業。</p>
<p>三，美屬菲律濱</p>
<p>菲島人口一千三百萬，大半從農，生活富庶整潔，棉布之輪入居進口第一位，自一九一七至一九二二年之五年間，每年平均輸入棉布為四千四百餘萬菲幣，一九二九年達五千四百萬，一九三三年為世界不景氣所激盪，跌至二千六百萬，最近兩年來，逐漸回復，已在三千二百萬菲幣以土。美國為宗主國，有進口免稅之最惠待遇，但事實上美國貨不能與日本貨競勝。如第一表所示，在一九三一年美國貨進口一千六百餘萬，而日本祇一千萬，但至一九三五年，則日本已進而與美國並駕齊驅，同為一千三百萬矣。照最近觀察，一九三六年之結統計內日本將超越美國矣。吾人更可從第二表輸入數量中來分析市塲之趨勢；在一九三五年，美貨進口以一千三百餘萬之代價，輸入三千五百餘萬平方米突，而日貨以同樣代價，輸入七千二百萬平方米突，美貨一碼之值，可換日貨兩碼，是美貨之被淘汰，日貨之崛起，自所必然。中國貨之輸入菲島，無論數量上價值上均佔極少數，大部分為十二磅及十六磅粗布，且除少數為永安，申新出貨外，其大多數仍為日本紗廠所輸出，實不能謂為中國貨也。</p>
<p>四，荷屬東印度</p>
<p>荷印為南洋最大之市塲，擁有六千萬人口，富有購買力。棉布之輸入，在歐戰以前，十九來自荷蘭，戰時日貨乘機進取，日益活躍，荷印政府乃於一九三四年二月二十日頒佈限制輸入條例，以保護荷蘭貨之輸入，此項限制，係根據一九二九至一九三三年之輸入數量為標準，例如：染色斜紋布二十六英寸內，每年可進口五百萬碼，因二百萬碼必須自荷蘭輸入，一百萬碼必須自英國輸入，其他百萬碼方可自其他各國輸入，日貨以其低廉之價格，故荷印進口商趨之若騖，若非政令限制荷英貨早無餘地矣。中國棉布之輸入，准可數量卽包括於其他各國之內，為日貨之唯一勁敵。據第三表之統計數字，可知一九三五年間全荷印棉布自日本輸入者佔百分之八十四，自荷蘭輸入者，僅百分之十二，自中國輪入者僅百分之·四七而已，誠瞠乎其後矣。荷印輸入棉布之品類，以漂白布為大宗，染色布次之，原布又次之，日貨輸入頗平均，中國貨除原布與印花布外，均無足道者，言之報顏。</p>

<h3>奮鬥</h3>
<p>— （小庭）</p>
<p>莫因奮鬥的終點是成功，有時也有失敗的堡壘放在你面前等待的。</p>
<p>奮鬥的失敗，是人生過程的經驗，奮鬥的成功，是人生吃苦的成績。</p>
<p>懦者無奮鬥心，庸者無奮鬥力，奮鬥的傻子，是聰明勇敢的人，唯聰明勇敢的人，才曉得奮鬥的價值。</p>
<p>越受環境壓榨的人，奮鬥的路程跑得越快，越遭事體失敗的人，奮鬥的進取越有把握。</p>
<p>一國人民無奮鬥心國必亡，一個人無奮鬥心身必敗。</p>
<p>酣歌恒舞的地方，是剝蝕奮鬥的魔窟，紙醉金迷的塲所，是沉沒奮鬥的深坑。</p>
<p>奮鬥的現實，是吃苦耐勞，慣會享樂的人，是談不到能在奮鬥圈子裏掙扎跳躍。</p>
<h3>浦東的蘆絮鞋</h3>
<p>— 姜峻青</p>
<p>連天朔風怒吼，又是浦東鄉鐵間蘆花蒲鞋盛行時了：——它是一般貧苦階級的禦寒妙品，用蘆絮和稻草所編成；高高的統兒，厚厚的鞋底：買了來，用布沿了邊，裏面再襯些棉絮，着在脚上，溫煖舒適，勝過綿鞋。售價每雙祇一角二三分，旣經濟，又耐用。</p>
<p>而且着這種蘆花蒲鞋可使空氣流暢無阻，不似綿鞋會裹得密不通風。脚氣病的人着之尤為合宜。</p>
<p>據説做手快的，每天可編五六雙，少亦三四雙不等，倘以每雙一角二分計之，每日編鞋四雙，卽可維持一家四五人的生計！所以，浦東一般勤苦鄉婦，都視此、為冬季唯一的輕鬆而多利的副業！</p>
<h3>西安的烏鴉</h3>
<p>— 光緝</p>
<p>西安這座古老的都城，自從去年十二月十二日事變之後，就成為舉世屬目之點了。現在蔣公雖早慶脫險，但西安的形勢，依然混亂！這自然是舉國上下，同深憂慮的一回事。</p>
<p>因為西安政局的關係，我又連想到西安最著名的烏鴉來了。凡是到過西安的，總誰都知道西安的烏鴉是再多不過的。當紅日初昇的辰光，一羣羣的鳥鴉，就從頹垣破廟中，或古舊的宮殿裏，像一窩蜂似的飛了出來，烏雲點點，蔚為奇觀，有時結隊成羣，飛到附近的田間野外，找着食物；有時就落向衛頭，覓取果腹的資料，你如果在街上踱着的時候，那它就在你的前面走着，隔不到两三尺多遠，一點兒也不會害怕，據説雜貨店裏的豆類和攤子上的魚類：甚至工人們手裏提着的肉，假使偶不當心，就隨時有被攫去的可能到了紅日西沉，暮色蒼茫的時候，於是遠的，近的，又成羣結隊的飛進了破廟和古老的宮殿中，爭着樓宿，那西安的清眞閣，就是它們的大本營，一時飛揚，呌噪，震耳欲聾，如果外國的威尼斯城，可算得＇鴿子的城市＇那我們的西安，也就可以命名為‘烏鴉的城市’了，</p>
<p>但是這許多烏鴉，為什麼又沒有人捕捉呢？那也是有原故的，因為那年鳥鴉一來得多，那年定是豐收；若是荒年，那烏鴉就一隻到留地飛去了，因此，西安的百姓們就認為烏鴉到來是很吉利的，正如我們東南方人對待燕子一般地任他在屋子裏築巢，惟愛讓之不暇了。</p>
<p>現在西安事件大致解决了！我們切望陝軍當局，從速懸崖勒馬，免得要採取武力勘亂，把西安弄成一片沙礫土，將來到了黃昏的時候，使鳥鴉來噪夕陽呢！</p>
<h3>香港鴨脷洲的船孃</h3>
<p>— 陳效坎</p>
<p>船孃，甚麼地方都有的，杭州的西湖；嘉興的南湖，皆是出產船孃的地方，可是那兒及得來香港的鴨脷洲的船孃呢。</p>
<p>香港的鴨脷洲，是和香港隔海對峙的一個島嶼，周圍的面積，大概有五里多點大，也可説是一個邨落。——島上的居民，什九是靠捉魚過活的，他們處此風平浪靜的島國裏，一樣有鮮妍的香花可玩；一樣有啁啾的鳥歌可聽，多末安逸而快樂呵！那處女般嫵媚：靜美，眞是一個世外的桃源，充滿着‘篷島風光’的醉人的情調。</p>
<p>那漁戶的女兒們，個個具有落魚沉雁的姿色；活潑流利的口才，因着生活的關係，就不得不尋箇比較容易撈錢的副業，貼補家用。但在這個年頭兒，還有什麼穩妥的生涯留着給娘兒們去做，伊們沒有旁的辦法，為了要滿足生活的慾望，不得不老起臉皮，去幹那‘船孃’的勾當了。</p>
<p>在月白風清的傍晚時光，要是您高興一點的話，跑到那綠草似茵的海灘上去玩一趟，那些打扮得花枝招展的船孃，就會對着您喊：‘阿要坐艇呀！’‘阿要住夜呀！’那聲音，那帶着神祕性的誘人的聲音，脆美的好似出谷的嬌鶯；掠花的雛燕同樣的動人聽聞；同樣的勾人靈魂！憑您是鐵鑄石鍋的心腸，也不怕您不想入非非的跨下艇去。</p>
<p>旣入艇中，您便可跟伊講艇價，大概一夜一切費用都在內，也不過二三塊錢。船孃邊撐着划子；邊又唱起誘人的小曲，凉爽的海風，陣陣地吹來，吹散了您混身的疲劳；吹散了你滿懷的煩惱！</p>
<p>一葉扁舟，蕩漾在這波平如鏡的海心裹，摟著一筒粉搓玉琢𧰟若仙子的佳人，誰能不心猿意馬，幹下浪漫風流的𧰟跡！——呀！鴨脷洲的船孃；鴨脷洲的黑夜</p>
<h3>橫浜橋畔</h3>
<p>— 志甫</p>
<p>橫浜橋，這一個地名，在你們的腦子裹，一定留下很恐怖的印象；這印象大概是昔年的一二八——槍砲聲好像依然的存在着，恐怖的氣象是依然籠罩。</p>
<p>前日，我偶然走過這裹，一股河泥的臭氣，非常的難受，河水不十分深，只看見有幾個捕魚人，口裹似乎説不出他的苦楚，他們是為了生活，為了要吃飯，只好受著寒冷，我那時呆呆地望着，心中總不免受了些感触動；</p>
<p>“你冷嗎？”</p>
<p>“魚捕到了多少？”</p>
<p>我問了這二句話，更加觸動了他的心思，他望望我，沒有什麽言語，這是怪不得的，唉！可算為幸福圈以外的人了。</p>
<p>這裏沒有大的商店，那末是什麽呢？是平屋吗？不！一面富然是荒了的草塲，這邊有几家友邦的商店，在桥下‘戰友’就是第一家，這個名字，怪有趣味的。在我國的各地，我敢相信，是我不到的，因為是找不到，所以要談談它；這個名字的意思，在我精想，大概是駐在我國的兵士相會時，大家去小吃小吃，所以稱它為“戰友食堂。”</p>
<p>除了這所食堂外，還有××跳舞塲，文具商店，學校，醫院，理髪店都是友邦人士所辦的；但是，我們在這裹呢？有的是藥店，當店，和幾家兌銀角的小店，別的舉不出什麼了；在當年很有名的申江樓菜館，早就關好了大門，那末，你們假使是沒有去過的話，見了我上面的幾句話，對於這地方的情形，就可想而知了。</p>
<p>但是，我希望這裹不要永遠地冷落下去，我們不要做生意嗎？我們不要仕嗎？為什麼？為什麼？為……難道有魔鬼在此地嗎？我們當然不會相信，就是有的話，我們也不會怕的。</p>
<h3>溥儀的四年傀儡生活</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>自‘九一八’而後，溥儀被挾持而做‘滿洲國’的傀儡皇帝，幾年來溥儀的生活，説來眞是非常的可憐。各國的遊客，到過東北的都知道溥儀是全世界最孤寂的一個皇帝。在這世界上，別個皇帝都住在大理石砌成的皇宮中人四週圍滿了宮臣，然而溥儀呢，自從辛亥革命失去北平寶座而後，‘九一八’後，想重溫皇帝的舊夢，可是現在他所住的地方，是一個廳務署的舊屋，這所屋子，事實上不像一個皇宮，而好像一個榖倉。</p>
<p>溥儀自在長春登位而後，直到現在，四個年頭中，祇離開過長春三次：一次是到瀋陽去謁陵祭祖，一次是到哈爾濱去檢閱‘滿洲團’的海陸軍，最後的一次是到日本去見日皇。他令年三十四歲，他的生活完全被困在那個用灰色磚瓦砌成的舊監務署的破屋中，四周張有鐵絲網，而且是通電的，每一個角子，用高墻圍成碉堡，派警守衛着以防萬一。</p>
<p>平常不但深居簡出，而且有外客去訪問，也不肯輕易使他接見。過往統治過有人民四萬五千萬的中國，而今在五間小屋之中，做一個儡傀抂帝，眞使他不勝令昔之感呢！他的夫人今年三十一歲，和他同居着，另外有幾個遜清的遺老，追隨在他的左右。賓客走進這所監務署的舊屋，比較可使注目的東西，祇有一架日本製造的龍椅。</p>
<p>溥儀的於運動方面，也祇·以網球為消遣，有時更聽體無綫電，如果月餘閒，便在讀書。他對於孔子所著的經書，非常愛讀，在生活上，一切的習慣，還是和國人無異。溥儀祇有一個夫人，據説這位夫人是他的原配，本來還有一個妾，可是不久之前，已宣告脫離。總之，他的傀儡生活，説來是非常可憐的！</p>
<h3>换巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十回（素帕寄䌂綿奇交鑄錯黃花對憔悴秋信添愁）</p>
<p>夢蘭心裏頭存下了這樣一個觀念，由學校回家去的時候，臉上也就不免帶了一種憂鬱的樣子，脅下夾了書包、兩脚好像有幾十斤重似的，一步只移動幾寸，慢慢兒的向後樓走去。天下作父母的，對於自己的兒女，邢是寸步都會留心到的。夢蘭這種情形，進家之後，首先就讓江太太看到。在他上樓之後，小菊立刻緊隨着他進房，因笑問首：小姐，你身上不大舒服嗎？夢蘭把書包放在書架上，在書架上，另抽下一本書來看。抽出一本書來之後，放在手上顚了兩顚，作個沉思的樣子，依然又放到書架上去，却把書包展開，取出一冊英文放到桌上，却又自言自語的道：我那有什麼心事看功課。於是重把書本放到書包裹去，對了那書桌的光面子，却是发了一會呆。小菊先問了他一句有病沒病的話，他並不踩，這話就不敢跟着問了。因之靜悄悄的垂手站在旁邊，不時向他脧上一眼。夢蘭對了這光桌而子，是看不出什麼意味來的。因之把眼皮抬了一抬，向窗子外面看去。首先送到眼睛裹來的，當然就是那三棵高大的柳樹。於是把兩隻手臂同變過來，斜撑了桌子，又向三棵柳樹上看去。聯想着國器寄的那幾首詩説得有，願作綠羽禽，棲君窗外柳，盡忘桃李嫌，終日窺戶肅。這種一往情深的話，見了有讓人邐腸盪氣。據他信上説過，會有一次月夜，獨自走到這柳樹下，對樓上的窗戶，呆呆看了好幾小時，直等露水灑滿了衣襟，身上凉得支持不住了，方才慢慢的回家去。就這一件事看起來，他之願作翠羽禽的詩，並非是一種信筆寫來的假話，實實在在為這番痴想。最近是有兩個月沒有見着了，想必是他那番痴心，養成了一種心病，更由這種心病，養成了這愁眉不展的樣子。若是要解除他愁眉不展的樣子，對症下藥，只有解除他的心病，依了他的心願，他就快活了。可是在自己的家庭和生活上，絕對辦不到。正這樣的想着，看到那衰老的柳樹枝葉，在半空裏不住的搖曳，那正可以表現出凄凉人眼睛裹的凄凉意味。（一二九）</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>公民訓練</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>第二期的公民受訓期終於輪到了，那些接到通知條的，只好無可奈何的齊集到區公所前去聽訓。那位教練官就是從前民教館襄的館長程先生，副教練是本鄉模範公民秦阿忠是一個細雨霏霏的下午，這平時冷落得鬼也捉得出的大操坪上，陸陸績續地走來了許多穿着破衣，束着大青布破圍裙的鄉人，大家都縮著頭，聳起眉，擺着袖子，一個一個的靠墻壁站着，一動也不動的像是一枝一枝的木㯸，每個人的臉上，却全露着一种不情願而又害怕的神情。</p>
<p>草坪上是静悄悄的鴉雀無聲，雖然那些待訓的公民們，有時也會竊竊私語一回，或幾個年輕好動的毛頭小夥子少不得要説幾句笑話，但聲音都是那們低微的，一個人也不敢組聲大氣。祇有塲角上那根旗桿頭頂的一面青天白日滿地紅旗，給風吹得在拍拍拍地發呌。對面民衆閱報牌上，今天也突然新添了一張佈告，這大約是為了第二期公民開始受訓的事情吧！</p>
<p>首先，寨副教練來給每一個公民的胸前釘上了一個三角式的符號，並且替他們挨着長短排齊了，做了幾個‘立正’‘稍息’的姿勢給他們看，然後對他們講述各種形式與方法；但是那些鄉民完全是沒有智議的，所以任他講得很吃力，他們還是連一些頭緒都沒有。</p>
<p>程教練從區公所裹走了出來，他一眼暼見了我，便走過來向我打了一個招呼，我説：</p>
<p>“教他們眞不容易呢，你很辛苦吧！”他對我笑了笑，沒有回話·自顧走過了操坪，那些公民却由秦副區教練指導著，可程教練行了一個敬禮。</p>
<p>他對秦阿忠説了一句什麼話，我們沒有聽得清楚，接着他在塲中間打了幾個旋回，手裹那枝皮馬鞭給他略得噓噓地發叫，模樣是怪英武威嚴的。</p>
<p>公民們還沒發制服，秦副教穿的也祇是一身灰布的武裝，但程教練那套嶄新的黃青色呢軍裝，樣子却十分好看的；他帽子上釘着一顆青天白，兩片硬領章，紅色的底子上劃着一條金綫，綫上每面裝着三顆三角形的東西，那麼亮晃晃地耀着人的眼珠了。</p>
<p>‘立正………稍息………’秦副教退後了两步，自己做了一個立正的姿勢，然後又把右脚向外伸，直著嗓子喊了起來；於是那些公民們也跟着他的模樣學着。喊過稍息之後，秦副教再教他們怎樣，向右看齊’，怎樣向前看’，怎樣報數，怎樣‘點名’。報過了數，程教練便將一枝皮馬鞭往腋下一挾，然後取出了一枝派克式自來水筆，翻開了那本名册點起名來。點了名以後，又是講述；然而因為程教練是蘇州人，所以一口純粹的蘇白，説來眞像蘇州人在台上演説一般，非常清晰動聽。</p>
<p>雨漸漸地緊密起來了，並且還夾着了一片一片的雪球，彷彿似一幅水晶簾子上綴了一朶朶梅花一樣地十分美麗，同時，程教練，秦副教和那些公民衣上帽上，也堆下了雪白的一層，於是，程教練也就草草地把他們散了隊。</p>

<h3>章淵若談中國統一運動</h3>
<p>兩大途徑　以法治求統一　以自力求統一</p>
<p>中央社云、本市各界發起之統一救國運動、業經引起各方注意、記者以兹事重大、非空言所能見效，昨特訪政論家章淵若氏、叩詢其對於推進統一運動之具體意見、承章氏詳談如下、</p>
<p>全國負起偉大任務</p>
<p>國家是一種有機的集體、統一靈動、是完成國家建設的最初階段中國民族如不甘落伍不廿滅亡、自惟有舉國一致上下一心、來努力於現代的大統一國家建設、所以統一救國、無疑的是目前無可否認的國是、全國同跑茍不忍坐視國家的分崩壟析、尤其應當一德一心來負起並完成這一個偉大的救國建國的歷史任務</p>
<p>問題核心在於認識</p>
<p>但是現在問題的實質、問題的核心並非在應否統一的空洞理論的辯證、而是在如何才能完成統一的正確途徑的認識在過去中國未嘗沒有統一的運動、但是歷史的經驗指示我們因為統一不得其道、却是愈言統一、而愈釀變亂、愈要統一、而愈成割據、愈求統一、而愈形分裂、</p>
<p>教國理論兩種主張</p>
<p>中國民族的機運、隨著國際危機的深化、已經到了一髮千鈞不可再誤的最後關頭、所以我們現在要做救國運動第一、不得行險徼倖第二、不能空言虛矯、務必要有切實可行之有效的妥善辦法、本此認識所以我（章氏自稱）對於救國理論、從來不願標新立異、好高騖遠、終是誠誠懇墾、切切實實、從平實處立言歷年以來、我對於國是、有兩個一貫不易的主張、第一、是法洽主義、第二、是自力主義、這兩個主張、雖是平凡、却應用無窮、卽是應用到統一運動上面來、也有其有力的功能</p>
<p>法治與統一之關係</p>
<p>法治運動與統運動、其開係的密切、可説是一物之兩面、因為法之為物、便是富有普遍性、甚或説統一性之統治的工具、照分折派的法家説、法令是主權者之命令而主權之為物、就具有對內的最高性與絕對性、、乃為構成國家之要素、就法律的機能來説、法者乃“天下之程式、萬物之儀表”法治的結果、便應‘任公不任私、任大道不任小物’、‘不得為患於法之內、不得任意於法之外‘絕不准有分歧割裂的行動、就歷史的經驗來看、歐洲各國所以能和平統一、‘莫不得有法外之意注外之行、’實卽為勵行法治尊重法治的成效從我們自己的歷史來看秦所以能併六國、一海內·廢封建·設郡縣·建立大統一國家的史基、也就是崇尚法治實行法治的結果</p>
<p>自力與統一之關係</p>
<p>自力與統一的關係、可分兩方面説第一、就是要努國建設、用經濟交通各種建設的事工、來縮短空間的距離來打破地域的障礙、來加增各地利害的聯系、促進全國人民族精神的團結、政治演進與經濟演進的階段、是相應的、法國在一五四○年、竟分成十六個政府卽至一七八九年、還是各自為政、會議有十餘處之多、歐洲各國所以能摧毀封建的舊制、建立統一的基體、實係產業革命後、經濟和交通事業發展的結果、何况以中國之大、我們更非切實努力建設不可、其次便要造成自力更生的信念、統一建國的工作、完全須本諸國民的自覺、基終民族的自力、民國以來、首多黷武正義者、要想假外力圖悻成、結果祇是造成循環不己的內戰、祇是損耗民族的元氣、加深國家的裂痕、最近西班牙的慘痛、便是不知自力、依賴外力、所引起的紅黑兩大勢力鬥爭的惡果、我們要求國家的統一首先要喚發民族的意識、認識國家的利害、不要據己芸人、不要為人利用、要左程右準、立乎中流、創建切合自己國家需要的中心思想、調整左右的矛盾、消弭思想鬥爭、否則必重蹈民國以來循環內戰·以及西班牙紅黑鬥爭的覆轍·如此、則非特統一建國盡成無可實現的幻夢、恐成中華民族亦將自相殘殺而為列強所瓜分、此卽所謂亡國滅種的非劇、可不戒懼</p>
<p>統一之道捨此莫由</p>
<p>以上所論、僅涉概念、以言其紹、尚待專論、然統一之道、捨此無由、其他一切、均為枝節、方今陝局好轉、海內平定、所望當局、本此二義、切實圖之、以法治求統一、以自力求統一、日內得暇、當卽著專論、與國人商討云、</p>
<h3>工部局擬自本年起增加二厘房捐</h3>
<p>房產業函請納稅會交涉</p>
<p>新新社云、本市地產業同業公會、為請取消工部局擬增二厘房捐事、昨函公共租界納稅華人會云、逕啟者、敝會迭據會員聲稱、據前報載、工部局擬自本年起、界內房捐、一律增加二厘徵收等語、不勝駭異、查滬地自一二八事變以後、市面日漸凋敝、地價則一落千丈、房屋則十室九空、此種慘澹之景象、為有目者所共覩、平時一般市民、對於原有之房租捐、尚不能按期照付、如將捐稅提高、更使房客不堪負担、縱租界當局、感於本年度之預算入不敷出、應從開支方面設法撙節、在此時機、再增加市民之負担、則市面難有復與之望、結果必影響於捐欵之收入、益為減少、亦非市政機關之福、應請設法交涉等語到會、當卽提交執監委員會議决、以此事如果屬實、自非市民所能負担、夙仰貴會為納稅華人之代表機關、務請轉函工部局、如果有此擬議、應請迅予徹銷、以恤民艱、實為公便、相應函達、卽希查照辦理、至深企禱、</p>

<h3>文藝界座談會詳記（續）</h3>
<p>傳東華　今天我們是邀請各位先生的本來、應該先由各位先生發表意見、現在主人先説話、似乎太不恭敬、但是主席推定兄弟先説、祇好遵命、補充、兄弟以為、無論任何人、平時所抱的觀念如何、但總離不了國人、以文藝界來説、第一步要從自己個人入手、現在文藝界的情形怎樣呢、據王雲五先生所辦的出版週刊的統計、文藝書藉的銷路一年跌一年、這樣的跌下去、我們這班人、就沒有地方吃飯了、為文藝界本身着想、這種現象、很可擔憂、我們用什麼方法來挽救、祇有再來一次文藝復興、救了文藝、就是救了自己的生命、大家知道、聯合是救濟的一個方法、但是方才邵先生説、數次聯合、都失敗了、為什麼失敗呢、原因還是在團體的意義、大家沒有深切認識的緣故祇有小的團體、沒有大的團體、甲的小團體、攻擊乙的小團體、因此許多力量都浪費了、大團體反而毫無力量、所以我們要把這種浪費的力量、轉移過來從事文藝復興的事業、這是必需的、其次要文藝復興、須要具備社會安定的條件、無論那一國的文藝史上、都是如此、以前文藝界所用的力量、不是求文壇的安定、反而造成文壇的紊亂、有時還因為文壇的紊亂、引起整個社會的糾紛、文藝如何能復興呢、不久之前、本市發起統一救國宣言、兄弟曾發表過一段意見、希望把沒有統一的局面用和平的方法來統一、現在這種希望、不久可以完全實現、國家旣形成了統一的局面、我們文藝界、更應趁此機會、把交壇上從事內戰的力量、移轉過來、大家統一起來、一致努力建設、復興文藝、所以我們幾個人、趁中國前途曙光流露的時候、請各位到會、表示一點意見社會所以不能安定的最大原因、在什麼地方呢、一方面固然在內、而比在內更大的原因、是在外、所以我們更進一步、希望以建設的力量、一致解决外來的問題、外來的問題解决了、社會才能相當的永遠安定、社會安定、才有文藝復與的可能這種意見好像很粗淺的、但是實踐起來、往往粗淺的地方、都會發生障碍、所以今天别的讓論不説、希望從這粗淺的地方更來研究社會的安定、內外的解决社會安定了、文藝才可以復興、這是最大的希望、</p>
<p>邵泃美　方才傳先生説主人先講話、似乎不恭敬、但是這次的會談、如果不先把開會的意義説明、恐怕各位不明白、所以兄弟解釋後、再請傳先生補充、現在索性再請洪深先生更補充一貫主人們的意見、</p>
<p>洪　深　諸位來賓、這次我們六個人、請各位會談、我參加得最遲、而我的態度也許是最露骨、最堅决、在幾個月以前、有一位朋友談起抗敵、當時我講過一句話、如果有一天中國與敵人正式作戰、而我個人沒有死在前綫、那麼我一生言行、都是欺騙、但這種意思、不能強別人與人相同因為大家各有各的見解和情感、自然不能使文藝界同人、都放棄工作、到戰塲上去就義、這不過是我個人願意如此、現在時局一天緊張一天、到今天有許多話從前可以客氣不説、現在不能不説、從前有許多顧忌、恐怕引起誤會、發生流弊、今天不能不明瞭的表示出來了、第一點、我們文藝界要澈底的結合不僅是今天在座的數十位結合而已、一定要全國的文藝工作者、都團結起來、數年以來、我們不必諱言、文藝界有左傾右傾之別、現在不問左傾或右傾、應該把本身的政治思想擱開、大家結合起來、來做救國流血的工作、今天在座的各似、當然大家都參加這種工作、更希望因事未到會的文藝界同人、也來參加、第一點、不分在朝在野、要一致結合、這是不必諱言的、我們文藝界、往往仔着在朝在野的心理、所謂在朝的作家、就是多少與政府接近些、所謂在野的作家、就是取嚴格的態度、來批評政治、到了現在、不應該再有這種心理、大家當一致結合起來、就我個人立塲來説、現在的政府、正在那裏努力和平統一、為什麼還有人要反對呢、當然每個人都應該擁護政府、現在喊出‘統一救國’的口號、口號沒有關係、我們希望事實上趕怏實現、祇要眞正統一救國、我們當然全力擁護的、諸位也許覺得我們六個人有點奇怪、何以忽然要召集這個會、發表宣言、但是我們都是三四十歲的人、在我們本生歷史當中、我們似乎不全是混蛋、除我以外、他們五位也不致十分愚蠢今天請各位到會、一定根據我們的理智與認識覺得有這樣的必要、才來約大家到此會談、最後、我再誦一段故事、我曾看過沈從文先生一篇小説、大意是説軍隊中有兩個士兵、天天打架有一次抬一籮米回營、走到半路上、又打起架來、打得頭破血流、打架固然打架、但米還是要送到營裏、最後、你看看我、我看看你、兩個人都起來把米抬到營裏、現在各位作家向政治立塲與政治立塲之間、從前縱有若干恩怨到了今天、這些小恩怨、我們要放棄、大家結合起來為最大的恩怨而努力、這是我的一點希望、</p>
<p>邵洵美　我們主人的意思已經講明、現在請各位發表對於統一救國運動宣言的意見、</p>
<p>簡又文　今天承六君子相邀、聽到各位的意見、兄弟甚為感動、所以站起來説幾句話、不過預先聲明、我的立塲、我是同各位一樣的、完全是作者的立塲關於各位所提出的意見、第一點、上海文藝界統一救國宣言、兄弟整個的贊成、第二點、組織中國文藝協會、兄弟尤其是贊成、兄弟對於這件事、已經禱告過一兩年、切望這件事趕快成立、不過我們研究一下、過去並不是沒有文藝團體、為什麼過去的文藝團體、都沒有結果呢、其中有幾個原因、第一、是文藝界的個人、自我主義太重、唯我獨尊、看不起別人、這如何能團結、第二、是小團體的自我主義也太重、甲團體攻擊乙團體乙團體攻擊甲團體、相互攻擊自然不能團結了、我們現在要想整個的團結、有幾點須要注意、第一、最好不要牽涉到政治、並且不要作政治的運動、因為個人的政治立塲、政治見解、容有不同、如果牽涉到政治、作政治運動、這個協會、就難能持久、譬如説、在協會裏面、要提出釋放張學良回去的主張、那麼、這個協會、就要發生許多內部糾紛、不能成立了、第二、個人的思想、不必全求統一、如果強迫個人的思想、那麼這個協會、恐又不能成立、以前作者協會、所以不能成功、就是出於有政治主張政治運動的背景、而且對於個人的思想又强求一致、所以我以為要組織文藝協會、最可能的有一點、第三點、打破自我主義、從前所謂文人相輕現在我敢提出一個口號、叫做”文人相重一個文人總有他可取的地方、否則不成其為文人、旣然有可取的地方、當然可以做朋友、不必相輕、第二點、要有一個團體來研究學問文學、為避免個人的思想冲突起見、你左倾或右倾到什麽程度、有什麽理由、不妨大家談談、也許可以溝通、第三點、要互相聯絡感情、思想上雖不能統一、而感情是可以統一的、所以再提出一個文人相親的口號、根據這三點、來組織文藝協會、一定可以成功、有了這樣一個團體、我們做事説話、都比較容易了、最後、雖然我們的政治主張不同、但是總可以找出一點相同的地方、我相信、沒有一個人反對愛國、為中國流血犧牲、是沒有人不贊成的、我們就根據這一個目的、結合起來、盡我們的力量、做下去、我相信這對於全體對於中國、對於文化、對於個人、都有很大的益處、</p>
<p>樊仲雲　在這個時候、談統一救國、巳經每個人都覺悟這一點了這次西安事變之後、張學良到南京、最近陝局的和平解决、都是以表示一般人覺悟到中國需耍統一、再不能內亂了、不過我觉得文藝界的人、對於這個思潮、似乎還沒有感受到重大的影響、這個原因、方才巳經有人説過文人的個性太重彼此相輕、但是另外有一個原因、就是因帝國主義的侵路而生的結果、這話怎樣講呢、要知道帝國主義、不但用武力經濟來侵略、而且還用思想來侵略、這是對中國文化很大的打擊、中國數千年來所以能統一、完全靠數千年來一貫的文化、中國的文化不但統一了中國、而且統一了全東方、日本暹羅·安南·朝鮮·等國、都曾受了中國文化的薰陶、自帝國主義的勢力侵入後誠、把中國固有的文化摧毀了、有許多人反把自己民族需要的統一性、也忘記了、跟着人家跑、方才簡先生説、愛國是沒有人反對的、可是在幾年之前、兄弟被人罵為愛國主義者、遭人反對、那時候應該講國際主義、在東三省喪失的時候、還聽到“擁護祖國蘇維埃”的口號、有了‘祖國蘇維埃’、還有祖國中國嗎’、難道一個人、可有兩個祖國、這種思想侵入之後、使中國文化統一感受打擊帝國主義武力的侵略、經濟的侵略、大家都看得到的、因此大家憤慨、要抗敵禦侮、但是思想的麻醉、等到人死了、還不知道是怎樣死的、因為有了思想的侵略文化統一被摧毀、因此中國統一的局面不易成功、尤其是現在的時候、要想眞正統一、不但要對內而且要對外譬如收復東北四省、才是眞正統一救國、但是收復東北四省、就與國際發生關係·任這個內外交迫的時候、我們的思想是不是應以中華民族為本位呢、對於這一點認識之後、兄弟更覺得文化思想統一的必要、方才有一位先生講過、祇要精神上思想上能够統一、物質建設不成問題、這話很對、我們看看西洋各國凡是產業落後的國家、尤其需要精神的發展與統一、法國的資本主義生產制度是不及英國發達、而法國的大革命運動、自由平等思想却領導了英國、德國產業發達、比法國還要遲、而德國對於哲學思想、坦頭苦幹、於是德國的哲學領導了全世界、俄國的經濟發展比英法都要遲向社會主義思想方面、又超越了全世界、中國旣然產業落後、更需要文化運動、有了文化運動、可以促進統一運動、以精神建設、促進經濟建設、所以兄弟對於六位先生的提議、非常贊同、不過這個宣言當中、字句方面、或許有不姿善的地方、最好請各位發表意見、加以修正、以大家的意見、來促成眞正的社會、（未完）</p>

<h3>特種現金保證辦法（續）</h3>
<p>銀行公會發表全文</p>
<p>二、行員方面</p>
<p>第一實行本辦法後、行員可免除覔保、及每年對保時墾求親友繼續作保之種種困難、蓋求人作保不如求己、第二　採用本辦法、不必如信用保險制度、每年付給鉅額保險費、亦不致如改用‘有限保證’、倘限度過高、足使保證人望而却步藉口退保、第三本辦法因有連帶處分之規定、所集各種資金、動用甚少、積有相當數額時、每年卽可從中撥出一部份、舉辦行員子弟學校、消費合作社俱樂部、運動塲、圖書館、等等福利設施、對終行員身心獲益匪鮮、且方案第二十一條、巳規定的欵、尤不致如過去商界舉辦職員福利設施之有名無實、</p>
<p>第四　本辦法、因有連帶處分、及扣存乙種保證金之規定、各同人所任職務、必能互相關切、足以聯絡感情、彼此監督、防杜舞弊、</p>
<p>第五　行員每月所繳之乙種保證金、除賠償舞弊損失外（其實有連帶處分之規定舞弊情事、必可減少、）行員於離職時、予以發還、視服務年期之修短、定發還額之多寡、是不啻在繳付保險費中、兼寓有儲蓄性質、</p>
<p>第六　如甲種保證金、及公共準備金、積至相當數目時、除部分辦理福利事業外、可由行方酌量投資於各項生產事業、藉作行員與行万之增益、此與美國信用保險公司之放欵情形相以、</p>
<p>第七　根據美國信用保險公司之統計、其保費之收入、除去折扣佣金雜耗外、實得不過百分之六十五至七十五、本辦法乃實事求是、並無此項捐失、</p>
<p>施行‘特種現全保證辦法’應注意事項</p>
<p>第一　採用‘特種現金保證辦法’、須有决心、有毅力、有精神、萬不可現金保證與保單同時施行、蓋如是非但不能解除行員覓保之痛苦自徒然增加行員經濟十之責任、（惟初辦時可暫緩取消）</p>
<p>第二　進用行員、除聘任之高級者外、應經筆試口試等手續、對於過去經歷。服務成績·與操守廉污、均應詳細調查、務宜審愼、錄取後、並應有二人之證明信、證明其品性、確屬優良、此種手續、似應有卽行舉辦之必要、</p>
<p>第三　好逸惡勞、人之常情、銀行行員、處都市奢靡之社會、意志薄弱者、極易誤入歧途、身敗名裂、試觀舞弊之起由、百分之六十以上、由投機僥倖之心、以冀幸而獲利、清償宿逋、不幸失敗、勢必出於侵占舞弊之一途、故欲屏除舞弊、必先嚴禁投機、改進行員之業餘生活、着手行员訓練事宜、提高其德性修養此種設施、可積極的創造行員優良之品性、再加嚴格取締投機、注意平時言動可消極的阻逼舞弊之動因、上述方案、第二十一條內、關於福利設施基金來源、已有規定、舉辦尤易、</p>
<p>第四　行員所任職務、必須侭量適合其個性、家庭收支、必須加以客觀的評量、使能樂業於今日、兼存希望於來兹、則生活安定、心不帝鶩、效率自高如已有行員宿舍者、甚同人晨夕相共、益可互相策勵、收效更宏、且宿舍管理者、對於各個住戶、可加以嚴密監督與考核、</p>
<p>第五　無論何種機關、若一人久專一事、不特自身感覺單調、亦且易生弊端、英國銀行各級行員、往往隨時更調、故舞弊案件、比較他國獨少、是以行員担任某種職務、經過相當時期、必須加以遷調、以免習久生弊在行員方面、兼習新技、並可增高興趣、</p>
<p>第六　‘特種現金保證辦法’實施時、應照章從嚴執行、不少瞻㣘、如遷就環境、有使整個辦法、失却效用之危險、又各行组织不同、故‘行員’二字之定義、尤须注意、</p>
<p>第七　行員發生舞弊案隐匿後、原介紹人應有將该行員之行蹝、立卽或隨時報告銀行、或將其送交銀行之責任、於進用行員時、並應由介紹人在徵用行員履歷及志願書內簽童承認、因保人廢除後、行方對於行員之根源、更形隔膜、偶生事端、追究為難、故令介紹人員、報告行員行蹝之責、藉可减少徇情滥蔗之弊</p>
<p>第八　如遇發生舞弊案時、除刑事处分·及民事赔償·依法嚴辦、不得稍予通融外、遇必要時、並應將舞弊人姓名相片登報公告、以杜敗類他日重在社會混跡、</p>
<p>第九　連帶處分、為本辦法之精髓、惟執行前、應精密考查務使責任分明、力求公允</p>
<p>第十　品行端王、動愼從公之行員、銀行應予獎勵、以資表彰、</p>
<p>第十一　行員服務保證規則、各種條文、務須詳加擬訂、以便事後有所根據、</p>
<p>第十二　為使現金保證草案、便於施行起見、應另訂施行細則、詳細規定一切施行手續、如人數較少之銀行、可聯絡各行合作只理、亦可收同樣之效力、</p>
<p>第十三　各銀行會計制度、必須嚴密組織、庶於新辦法、更易收效、</p>
<p>第十四　應隨時遣派稽查人員、赴各分支行、審核賬目、與業務實况、但所派人員、必须極端秘密、並隨带憑證、開具姓名職務、粘貼相片以免奸宄、聞英國銀行界、類多應用、</p>
<p>第十五　凡行員入行之始、應出立誓書、宣示絕對遵守、‘特種現金保證辦法’所規定之連帶處分、及其他法規决不推諉卸責、</p>
<p>第十六　現欵及標據收支員、及保管員、不得兼任記帳及他職</p>
<p>第十七　檢查現金保管及帳目、應對內對外、同時舉行、</p>
<p>第十八　單據簽字應採副署、收付欵項應經二人以上手續、</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>近代團體組織、山於事務之紛繁職能之互殊故均採分工方式、兼重合作精神、團體之中、每一份子之工作、必須獲得體體份子之合作、調整配合、方可運轉靈活、個人之職務、必須通過團體之聯結、構成有機之體系、首尾相應、脈絡貫通始能發揮功用、是故一人之職務、以團體之觀點、加以分析、頗具社會性之意味、不容忽視、返觀我國保證制度、依然由各人軍獨覓保、塡具保單、分別向團體負責、人自為謀、不相聞問、是辦事組織、已達集體分工之境地、而保證制度、仍未脫個人主義之色彩、實為我國商業管理之矛盾、狀人倡議‘特種現金保證辦法’、旣有甲種保證金、為自身之保證、徵收乙種保證金、並提撥內種保證金、為公共之保證、再令同行處有關係之人員、連帶負責、使同一團體辦事人員職務品性、均生緊密之聯繫、一掃過去個人主義保證制度之流弊、符合現代‘羣衆主義’、及‘社會聯立關係’之精砷、與集體分工之組織、互用調和、此本辦法之理論基礎也、抑尤有進者、新式銀行商店、為審核週密、愼防疏漏起見、辦事厲行‘內部牽制、’、故每一營業過程輙經數人之手、加以會計上‘平衡’原理之運用、對於防止舞弊、不能謂絕無功效、惟此種機械式之牽制、僅能於形式上互相監督、以之管理現代事務繁忙之團體、猶虞不足、過去舞弊案件之層見疊出、卽其明證、‘特種現金保證辦法、’我人雖不取奢望其絕無流弊、然於原有辦事上機械式之監督以外、兼可促成精神上之結合、則可斷其必可奏效、故不明本辦法寓意深切之人、或疑一人舞弊、何以責令同事運帶負實、匪惟不近情理、抑且獎勵作惡、然觀於上文之闈釋、必可憬然悟矣、</p>
<p>嘗聞有一人而為數人或數十人保證者、如被保人中發生舞弊、該保證人邀集被保證者責令分擔賠償、否則全部退保、被保者衆口一詞、均表願意、此為上海商界中常有之事實、我人分析被保入所付連帶賠償之欵項、其性質殆近於相互保證之資金、足見共同撥欵準備賠償舞弊損失、實屬事勢所演成、“持種現金保證辦法”中之乙種保證金、僅係採用現存之習慣而巴、况中央各機關如交通·鐵道·等部、其會計出納人員、早經採用現金保證、是政府機關、旣倡行於前、銀行界仿行於後、亦為時勢所必然、總之、個人信用保證制度、在曩昔農業及手工業社會中、自有其時代之意義、方今我國已由單純之農業經濟、演進為工商經濟、潮流所趨、為個人保證、勢將淘汰、新的保證制度、將應事勢之要求、發揮其時代之使命、自無疑義、試觀上海各大外高銀行、採用保單制度者、已不多見、偶有沿用、多係買辦對於行方之保證、未足據為定論、惟我人倡行之‘特種現金保證辦法、’僅為糾正現行銀行保證制度之缺點、試探新制途徑之建議、雖實行時能否不生流弊、尚待經驗之指示、然如加以革命式之推行、斬荊披棘、不稍畏憚、當有良好之收獲、慮而有得、古有明訓、用特不揣讕陋、提供討論、尚祈卓裁指正、無任企增、（完）</p>

<h3>工部局拒絕路工要求</h3>
<p>决定單獨進行抽籤　虞洽卿氏今日調處</p>
<p>大公社云、公共租界工部局全體築路工人一千二百餘名、為反對工務處抽籤裁汰、於前日起實行聯合總龍工、工部局工務處、對路工耍求、决拒绝接受、雙方各趨極端、華董虞洽卿氏、定今日向工都局進行調解、兹分誌群情於後、</p>
<p>單獨抽籤</p>
<p>工部局工程處、原定於三十日上午九時、召集全體路工、在工程處集合聽候抽籤裁法、並將工牌一律吊回、至留用之路工、改發新證章、以資識別、詎料全體路工均一致反對、實行聯合罷工致此項抽籤手續、無法進行、故暫告展緩兹悉局方對决定施政方針、不因此而中斷將實行單獨抽籤、俟手續完畢後、再通知去留之路工、一面按址吊銷工作牌子、</p>
<p>拒絕請求</p>
<p>大公社記者、昨向工部局工程處方面探詢、關於路工所提各項理由及要求收回裁減成命、將如何處置、當據局方負責人聲稱、此次裁减路工十分之九、係工部局裁員减政方法之一、早經會議决定、當不能隨便變更、或因工人龍工而撤銷政令、故事實上巳無可挽回、况抽籤裁法、以定去留辦法至為公正、而使被裁之工人、將後局方對路政上之工作繁忙時、仍可充任臨時工、不致卽為失業、今路工突然罷不、恐係受人指使、局方正在嚴密偵查中、希望工人、不這外間煽惑、照旣定辦法履行、較為適當云云、</p>
<p>繼續罷工</p>
<p>全體築路工人、昨日仍繼續罷工、並定令晨九時、仍由李景春、劉煥文·張步瀛·蔡富榮·王雙才等五人、組請願代表團、分赴市黨部市政府等各機關請願、要求予以援助、以維生計、</p>
<p>組糾察隊</p>
<p>工部路築路工人、自實行聯合罷工後、為維持秩序起見、經代表團議决、組織糾察隊、計安東路·和路·沙涇路·湯思路·蘇州路·麥根路·大通路·等七區·每區推出十人、共計七十人、分為七隊、輪派擔任糾察事宜、以免發生事端、</p>
<p>虞氏調處</p>
<p>工部局華董虞洽卿氏據築路工人請求救濟後、認為路工一旦被裁、生計堪虞、且際兹冬防期間、與地方治安、頗有關係、故决於今日上午上時赴工部局晤總辦費力涌、進行磋商解决辦法、並定下午五時將調處經過答復築路工人</p>
<p>市民表示</p>
<p>第一特區市民聯合會第七·十二·十六·二十七·三十八·等各區分會、以工部局此次减縮開支、並不從高級洋員著手、竟將每日所得數角工資之華工裁汰、致造成罷工風潮、昨特聯名蓋章、函工部局提出嚴重交涉、要求轉飭工務處、收回成命、</p>

<h3>人壽保險之功效</h3>
<p>— 張明听</p>
<p>人壽保險，為保險制度之一種，依人類互助之原則，據科學精密之計算，將個人因生命危險所受之損失，分配於多數人之團體，使不幸者得以，救濟，民生獲有保障。其作用足以安定個人生活，鞏固社會組織，助長國家繁榮，為現代社會經濟組織中最重要之事業，在歐美各國，久著成績。我國今日，正當經濟衰落，民生困窮，社會不安之際，此種事業，實為對症之藥石，舉國上下，亟應一致提倡，積極推進，以期收獲復與民族之宏效。兹將其一般功效，略述如左：</p>
<p>（一）對於個人之功效：日出而作，日入而息，仰事父母，俯畜妻子，此人生之常軌也，然禍福無恒，死生靠定，一人之身，偶有不測，則藉之以生者闔家之經濟來源，頓告斷絕，老幼養教之所需，舉無所出，悲慘之象，奚可具陳！恒人每以此後顧之憂，而感懷苦悶，不能自安，而影響所及，每致生活消極。若加入人壽保險，則將來所得之金額、足以補救不幸事故之發生？而資以善其後，使舉家消除危險之憂慮，個人獲得心身之安泰。此種心理之影響，足以增進生命之活力，養成道德之向上，助長工作之效能，而有裨於整個民族前途之發展，至為鉅大。試觀凡保有壽險者之死亡率，比較一般人民之死亡率特低，可為顯著之證明事實。是以許伯納Hucbnere有云：“凡有贍養家話之義務者，均宜藉人壽保險以資保護，……我人應視不保險者為犯罪。”斯言泃足説明人壽保險對於個人之如伺重要矣。</p>
<p>（二）對於社會之功效：人壽保險，原為一種社會政策；在消極方面，可以防止社會之病態，如貧困，失業，犯罪，失學等，由於經濟缺乏而起之一切不良現象，可藉以消除；在積極方面，可以增進社會之福利，如慈善，教育，衛生，治療等，與人艮生活有關之一切計會設施，可藉以舉辦；使社會日趨於健全光明之域，其功效至寫偉大。歐美各國人壽保險之積存金，亦多投資於公益專業；足徵人壽保險為建設近代社會之原動力。至於人壽保險對於社會之精神上效，則尤難以佔量；如養成儲蓄之習慣，節儉之風俗，互助之精神，倫理之觀念，均與社會之進步，有絕大之關係也。</p>
<p>（三）對於國家之功效：人壽保險，除對於個人生活，社會組織，均有裨益外，更有極鉅大之功效，厥維集中民間之游資是也。是項細微之游資，經人壽保險公司集中之後，即成為巨大之資本，用以扶助國民經濟之發展，促進國家之建設，維持政府之財政，其力量殊為偉大。美國全國鐵路四分之一資本，由於人壽保險公司所供給，其他如公債劵，產業貸欵，實業股份等，亦佔鉅大部份。在歐戰時期，英美人壽保險公司應募政府之戰事公債，達二十萬萬元之多。人壽保險之有利於國家，概可見矣。</p>
<p>以上所述，僅就人壽保險之功效顯而易見者，略言之耳，其有裨於個人社會國家之鉅且大如此，無怪近時覘一國之盛衰強弱者，每以其人民投保壽險之多寡，作為佔量之準繩焉。願我國人，速加注意，則民族前途，庶有豸乎</p>
<h3>壽險事業之發展</h3>
<p>— 項馨吾</p>
<p>壽險事業，歐美先進國家，極為發達。對於社會安定，國民經濟，英獻之鉅，無待殫述。其在我國，雖亦有數十寒暑之歷史，若干人士之努力，然猶如初茁之花，有待保養培青。不佞於壽險本嘗精研，竊憑直覺之思維，以為此項事業之發皇滋長，其基點有三：一日國家法律之督護：一日事業組織之健全；一日壽險知識之普及。而三者尤闕一不可！蓋國家法律不頒，事業失所憑藉：事業組織不良，推進難期暢順；壽險知識不遍，需要無自而生也。邇者政府保險業法即將實行，保險法亦已公布；壽險事業之經營，亦尚進步不已，而漸臻於合理；而負傳播壽險知識之重責之壽險專刊，適焉問世。壽險事業，似可因之躋入由花而實之階段。吾人際此，自當不勝其欣喜雀躍矣。國人對於人身死亡之經濟捐失，將如何懔然認議，進而對於壽險發生信仰，進而對於蒙受損失者負起責任乎？走筆至斯，實不禁寄其無涯之熱望也。</p>
<p>吾人大半均賴日常收孔㕥爲生苟一旦身遭不測妻孥即失所依賴欲謀捄濟厥惟人壽保險人壽保險者非保吾人可㕥長生而不死乃賠償其自身故所受經濟上之損失也　馬寅初</p>
<h3>近代人壽保險事業發達史</h3>
<p>— 郭雨東</p>
<p>近代人壽保險事業之創設，在科學基礎的死亡表確立以後，所以我們要研究它的發達史，對於死亡表之製作，不能不簡單説明一下。</p>
<p>死亡表之製作，雖始於古代羅馬法家烏爾平納（Dmltius）氏，但其材料渺茫，是否正確，無可考查。迨十七世紀中葉，法國佛爾馬特（Rierd　de　Fermat氏與派司凱爾（Blaise　pascal）氏兩大數學家於一六五四年共同發表蓋然率論（Doctrinc　of　Probabilities)以後，世人始知人類生存死亡之動向，可以數字表示之，次之，於同世紀末葉，德國宗教大家諾易曼（Dr·Caspar　Neumann）博士，以非常之熱心與驚人之忍耐力，不僅把一六八七年至一六九一年之布列斯拉（Breslau）與希來叔亞（Suesia）市的死亡登記十五，八六九件——依年齡別與男女別加以整理，且把同年度出生者，也詳為調查，彼此對照，死亡表之基礎材料，遂因以構成。這種材料，由諾易曼氏送與英國天文學大家哈雷（Edmmud　Halley）氏，請他指正，極得哈雷氏之讀賞，於是哈雷氏以此為根據，於一六九三年乃有布列撕拉死亡表（The　Morlrtality　of　Breslau)之發表，是為死亡表之嚆矢，所謂近代人壽保險事業，即奠基於此。兹就各國分別言之如次：</p>
<p>一，英國英國為人壽保險事業之鼻祖，於一六九八年，在倫敦就有模爾薩斯公司（Meroers　Company）之設立，翌年又有寡婦孤兒保險協會（The　Society　of　Aidows　and　Orphans）之設立，但經過未久，均先後破產，是為英國人壽保險事業最初之犧牲者。次之一七○六年，依哈特來（John　Hartey）氏創案，有所謂友愛保險協會（AmicableSociety　for　a　Pcrpetual　Assurance）之設立，係相互組織，會員最初限定三千人，保險金百磅，每年繳納保費六磅四先令，但也因為缺乏科學知識，而告解散。繼此而後，於一七二一年，得國會之特許，則有皇家（Royal　Exchange　Assurance　Corporation）Assuranec　Coporation）兩保險股份有限公司之產生，就人壽保險單發行的歷史説，自當推以上兩公司為最早，不過應用有根據的死亡表、而最初開始經營死亡保險的，要以一七六二年創立之公平保險社（The　Society　for　the　Equltable　Assurance　on　Lives　and　Survivorships為嚆矢。換句話説，也就是近代人壽保險事業之元祖。此保險社，係互相組織，社員多鳳受高等教育的上流人物，重質不重量，為其發展過程中一貫的政策，現在經營百七十餘年，仍然堅實如故，在人壽保險事業界，實占有最光榮的歷史，所謂老公平（Old　Equitable），就是此社。</p>
<p>自公平保險社成功後，英國人壽保險事業的基礎。遂由此造成，其後相繼設立者，至一九三三年度止，巳有七十餘家，保險金總額，祇是英本國，巳達二十八億五千七百四十三萬磅，地位僅次於美國，而居世界第二位。</p>
<p>二，美國美國是人壽保險事業的大本營，保險金額，占全世界三分之二，當然論地位，是首屈一指的了。至於它的發達史，最初經營者，始於英國人壽保險公司之代理處，其後於一七一五九年，有浦列斯畢特安牧師基金（Presbltarian　Ministers　Fund)之設立；於一七六九年，有艾皮斯考波利安牧師基金（EpiscopalianMinisters　Fund）之設立，兩者均係相互組織，且加入者資格，祇限於牧師，對於一般人，毫無利益。其應一般人之需要而設立者，則為一人三五年，得Massachusetts　州特許之新英格蘭人壽相互保險社（New　Engand　MutualLife　Insuranc　Company,此社係模仿英國公平保險社組織而成，基金為美金十萬元。次之則為一八三六年，得Pennsylvania州特許的犬衆保險公司（General　Eiie　and　tiust　Company），是為美國獨立經營人壽保險事業的股份有限公司，與相互組織者，成為美國人壽保險事業之二大壁壘。迨一八四二年紐約人壽相互保險社（The　Mutual　Life　of　New　york）成立後，美國人壽保險事業，遂澎湃發展，一往無阻。依一九三四年度統計，保險金總額，已達美金九百八十五億餘；資產總額，已超過美金二百一十八億；每年總盈餘二十二億以上，其盛况可以想見。（未完）</p>
<h3>人壽保險與新生活運動</h3>
<p>— 關可貴</p>
<p>自從蒋委员長提倡新生活運動以來，全國各省市縣，均組織新生活運動分會，推行所及，萎靡之風，為之一變。蓋為挽救國難，復興民族計，提倡新生活運動，實為根本要圖，刻不容緩者也。新生活運動乃將我國數千年來舊有美德，禮義廉恥四事為其骨幹，以之劃入於新生活公約，表現於日常行動之中，使人民易於遵行，隨時實踐之一種方法。人之生活，本無所謂新舊，只要其能躬事力行，適宜於現在環境者便是新，我國舊有禮義廉恥之美德，人多以之為老生常談或以之為裝飾點綴之語，而不能實施於日常生活，此乃最為可惜之事。新生活運動云者，即將此固有美德，盡力發揮，造成一個有紀律的，有秩序的，有系統的，有計劃的個人生活，並將其推進於人與人間所發生的關係之中，而造成一個有紀律的，有秩序的，有系統的有計劃的社會生活。故新生活運動的意義，就是想把我國民族原有之美德，推揚發闡，造就適合生存於現在環境的一個優秀公民及優秀民族。</p>
<p>關於如何方可推進新生活運動，及何種生活活動應為推進新生活運動之對象等問題，新生活公約中固有相當規定，觀夫蔣委員長頒佈新生活運動勞働服務團組織大綱中，已規定第十五項為‘提倡儲蓄保險運動’，可知‘保險’一事，為新生活運動中一種重要對象，固屬無可疑義，而保險運動中尤以“人壽保險”一事為個人新生活運動中之基本要著。德國經濟學大家安格爾氏（Engels）研究歐洲大陸各國人民生活問題，凡二十年，其研究結果，發鎖“人壽保險”為歐洲大陸各國人民標準生活中之一重大要素，兹將安氏研究關於歐洲大陸各國人民平均個人生活費百分率分配表録下，以為證明：</p>
<p>上表係對個人生活費之研究，故其所指保險費一項，當然是指人壽保險而言。由此可知歐洲人士，平均個人生活費中，人壽保險費與醫藥費相同，而比諸文通費則超過一倍。人壽保險費在歐人八大生活費中而佔其一。人壽保險對於標準個人生活中，其所處地位之重，槪可想見。</p>
<p>兹更將人壽保險能推進我國新生活運動所揭示禮義廉恥之功用，略為述明之。</p>
<p>語云：‘衣食足而後知榮辱。’衣食不足而能知榮辱守禮節者鮮矣。如何方可維持目前衣食充足，此固一般人急待解决之重要问题；然目前已可维持衣食，只以不能未雨绸缪，先事筹划，一旦危险来临，衣食便归无着，随而丧失操守不顧禮節者，亦繁有徒。人壽保險乃維持個人未來衣食充足之一種保障，亦即維持個人一生操守禮節之一種保障。此人壽保險能推進新生活運動所揭示‘禮’之功用也。</p>
<p>疾病老死，意外事變，誰屬能免。為家長者能於生產力富強之時，投買人壽保險，使其受瞻養者，不致因遇上述危險而困苦無告，失學失養，此乃個人對家庭所盡之“義”也。因投買人壽保險，有備不虞，使能緩急相通，扶貧濟困，此乃個人對朋友所盡之‘義’也。投賣職工團體壽險，使職工安心工作，不生見異思遷之想，消弭勞資糾紛，促進社會安甯，此乃行政者對社會所盡之“義”也。凡此義舉人壽保險俱能致之，此人壽保險能推進新生活運動所提示‘義’之功能也</p>
<p>“大富由天，小富由儉。”人壽保險，不一定要富而多金者方可投買，而貴在能使入息微薄之薪水階級，對其收入，廉儉處理，劃出相當成數，以為投買。由此廉險所積，涓滴所成之欵，至相當時期，便如積土成山，集成巨欵，雖非大富，應可小康，即使不幸，中途死亡，而其家人亦可得此巨欵，以作種種事業。故人壽保險較諸廉儉儲蓄之法，效力更偉，保障更多，此人壽保險能推進新生活運動所揭示“廉”之功用也。</p>
<p>人莫恥於不能獨立而依賴他人，尤莫恥於不能為自己及家人打算，以致將來自己及家人哀憐告乞，受惠他人，設使能在有時想及無時，先事投賣人壽保險，以為保障，又何至於受此哀憐乞告，依賴他人之恥辱乎？此人壽保險能推進新生活運動所揭示知“恥”免“恥”之功用也。</p>
<p>新生活運動所揭示我輩者，乃以禮義廉恥四事為骨幹，而人壽保險則有推進禮義廉恥四事之功能，故實行新生活運動者，不可不認識人壽保險，不可不注意人壽保險！</p>
<h3>收留乞兒引狠入室金業交易所竊鉅欵浪費</h3>

<p>及壻施榮等四人、結果顧得八百元、施得五百元、柳亦得八百元、尚有二百元則由柳出立借據、現柳仍居閘北、施則已返甯波云云、華探乃往閘北將柳逮捕收押、於前晨將顧·柳·二人解送第一特院刑五庭、捕房律師張師竹</p>
<p>依法起訴據高顧氏投訴被竊情形、並稱顧興福並非我之胞弟、因其自幼為一乞兒、常向我家求乞、由我收留撫養長大、殊不知引狼入室、養虎喪身云云、詁之顧興福、承認竊取存摺、與柳施分用、但此項主意、亦由柳起意等詞、質之柳吉敏、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>三千萬粵民將有絕粒之虞</h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>糧價暴漲問題正日益嚴重的今日，索以仰給於洋米及他省產米的廣東，糧食問題的急轉直下，引起突然的嚴重，其實是必然的，在預料中的事。然而，正因為這樣，我們對這關繋全國人民的生活問題，我們更不能不予以深切的注意。“三千萬粵民將有絕粒之虞”，其實就是四萬萬五千萬同胞將變成餓莩的先兆。</p>
<p>關於糧價暴漲的問題，在一般的了解，奸商居奇與敵人高價收買自屬主要的原因，可是以此一般的原因來繞粵省糧食恐慌這雖不是特殊的，但含有絕大的地方性的現象，便有他的差別在。換一句話説，粵省糧食恐慌的成因，還有他的地方性在。相信稍偽涉獵過關於粵省糧食問題的著作，或者曾到過廣東，而且居住過的人，也許都會明白粵省糧食的供給來源。而粵省糧食最缺乏者，當然便是主要的‘米’。現在把粵省仰給洋米及外省米的數字抄錄如下</p>
<p>“粵省二十二年來（民元——民廿二）洋米進口共一萬七千九百餘萬擔，平均每年有八百十餘萬擔输入。至於省外各地國米的輸入，為數亦屬不尠，總計廿二年來，平均每年有二百餘萬擔，內以皖米居半，餘為桂，贛，湘米。準此以觀，合洋米國米二者輸入數，平均每年約有一千餘萬擔。”（據本報二十六日載廣州通訊）</p>
<p>從這一數字，我們看到下面這一現象：粵省糧食幾乎全部依靠外米輸入：而又以洋米輸入佔百分之八十強。由此而觀，粵省糧食恐慌這是廿二年來”的事，不，其實可以説是不知若干年以來的事了；而且，假如洋米一天停止供給，‘二千萬粵民’却是隨時隨地‘有絕粒之虞’的。然而，我們對這一含有如此大的嚴重性的問題，却一直漠視着，絲毫沒有重視，直至現在荒象已成了，才來“呼顱”，“救濟”，未始不是一向“頭痛醫頭”的政策的弊害罷。不過，“亡羊補牢，猶未為晚”，對於這一問題的根本救治，實在是目前所急需商榷的。</p>
<p>目前的荒象的嚴重，可以如下數事表現之。第一，“下等糙米每元亦僅得六斤餘”。第二，“南海，高明，順德，三水（按此四縣均屬頭等縣）發生飢民搶米風潮。第三，“卽號稱模範縣治之中山縣，亦因米荒之故，餐及糖土”。第四，在廣州有“三五人結成一組，挨店驅食，崗饕亦理不勝理”。現在再來説一個最可怕的景象吧——廣州“存米僅三百九十三萬餘斤，祇敷數日之需”。當然，在這麽一個危險的關頭，急謀救濟實在是一件必需的事，因此所提出的四項辦法，如：一、免洋米稅；二、制止米商居奇：三、减輕糧食運費；四、重申土米外運禁令。都是萬不得已的，尤以第一項為“刨肉醫瘡”的方法。同時。在全國糧食均呈恐慌狀態的今日，外省米運粵也决不是一件萬全的方法。不能自給自養這問題的癥結，也决不是四項消極的辦法可以挽回。事已危急了，我們怎能坐視二千萬粵民絕粒！</p>
<h3>“醉生夢死”觀後感</h3>
<p>— 李一</p>
<p>業餘劇人在卡爾登演出</p>
<p>以意義上講起來，業餘劇人這次公演的三個節目中，是以這個“醉生夢死”比較的最積極的。“慾魔”的托爾斯泰氣味太重：“大雷雨”也祇以暴露為止，雖然這個陰慘慘的悲劇中，還有一個跟情人逃跑的瓦爾瓦拉：至於這個“醉生夢死”，則這裹的賈麗貞是比娜拉看得更多，懂得更多，而此娜拉認識得更清楚正確而出走的。</p>
<p>所以，如果説娜拉的出走祇有回家和做妓女兩條路，則賈麗貞應該是這兩條路之外的，她的出走已不像娜拉那樣的慨念，她所爭的也已經不是光是為着所謂人權，她的前途應該，而且是必然的比娜拉更有為的。</p>
<p>或許是客觀環境的限制？很遺憾的，這裏對於賈麗貞的從事援綏運動，除了在説明書上告訴了我們之外，在舞臺上，却連一句台詞都沒讓我們聽到，雖然有着一句“國總是要愛的”話，但這對於麗貞以後的出走，在力量上，顯然是不够的：奧克塞的原作我不知道，改编後的劇本我也沒看過，但就以簡短的説明書來看，我敢相信，賈麗貞這一角色的存在，是一定寫成為一方面一國總是要愛的”，而另外一方面在她的日常生活中，她正和其他的小資產階級的女兒同樣，她少不了要戀愛，並且是把大部份的精神化在戀愛上面，等到戀愛的夢幻滅了，她發覺了卽使是寸步不離追求她的紀德文，在知道了她受了騙，並且是有了孕之後也會掉首而去，於是覺悟到這些問題决不是她自巳個人的問題，於是她毅然的出走，走上她新的道路上去。</p>
<p>在原來的劇本中，關於賈麗貞的愛國部份或許本來是不多，但像現在讓我們看到的，却實在太少了，少得賈麗貞以後的覺悟，成了突然。這是導演者的疏忽還是客觀環境的限制呢？從説明書上有一援綏“字樣而台詞却一句都沒有看來，後者的原因或許是超過前者的。</p>
<p>把世界名劇消化了改編成適合国情，這努力是可喜的，‘醉生夢死’把當前的援綏的問題聯繫起來，這努力自然更值得我們敬佩，如上舉的賈麗貞之外，另外如那個出卖了朋友的‘漢奸’賈江男的插入，原則上，當然是可以存在，並且應該存在的，但，如我們現在所看到的那樣，則賈江男這樣的人物，實在是太晦喑了，（他的恐怖的原因在第三幕才交代出，也太遲。）在戲劇的調子上，像現在這樣的賈江男這樣人物的插入，於空氣上，也好像受到不少的阻碍。</p>
<p>賈江男這樣人物和“醉生夢死”的調子不大調和，（另外如李太太的插入也如此）這原因，我以為興導演的手法問題也不無關係，導演者在這裏好像太注重於笑料，以致等李太太出塲或賈江男從房內恐怖地呌起來的時候，戲的氛圍便突然一轉，因為突然的緣故，給人的感覺，便多少會覺得不自然。</p>
<p>其次，那是人物的刻劃問題，“在醉生夢死”中，人物的刻劃是很深刻的，每個人的個性很顯然，但是劇作者雖替他們的鼻子上盡上了白粉，於諷刺上，却還覺得不够深，戲劇的諷刺力量一單薄，那在給於觀衆的印象，便也損失了若干的預期的效果了。</p>
<p>關於舞臺裝置，這兒正和其它兩個戲一樣，是很漂亮的，但据我看來，我以為祇要搭一個室內的佈景也是够了，屋頂可以不要，屋外的樹梢等更可以不要，像現在這樣，屋外的景旣沒有什麼特別的用處，而等門一開，門的影子反射在屋外的天慕上，也很不好過，那麼，何不就乾脆地不要呢，如果説那是要顯示時間的變換，那麼，就是室內，也可以借燈光來變換的。</p>
<p>演員們的演技，顧而已和施超都好極了，李琳的戲很重，但這裏她却迎刃有餘的做到了從容不迫的地步，趙丹的戲是沉着老練的，但還看不出他是一個騙取女人貞操的壞蛋：飾賈江男的李清和飾李太太的藍蘋，在演技上是不錯的，但因為和戲的調子不調和，多少影響了給觀衆的印象。張客和吳湄很努力，大體上也很盡職。</p>
<p>關於效果，不能算壞，不過那羣衆　的口號，我却嫌欠雄壯些，或許那是後臺喊的人太少的缘故，不然，給那個出賣朋友的人的威脅，那力量一定是更大的。</p>
<h3>吳湄李琳分飾母女</h3>
<h3>愛國貴婦</h3>
<p>— 慕伊</p>
<p>禮拜六的晚上，在那靜安寺路的大飯店舞應中，擠滿着各界的貴賓，原來是某先生假座那裏，舉行交際宴舞會。</p>
<p>賓客中有一位貴婦，她最受人的注意，因為她不單是裝飾華美，容貌妍麗，動作合拍，尤其是她的頭髮，色黑光明，並且從髮際透出陣陣的幽香，傳入別人的鼻管，引起別人的視線。</p>
<p>不知道的人，總以為她使用的髮水是上等的外國貨，所以才能使頭髮如此色黑，如此香濃。其實她所用的香髮水，乃是國產的“一三一頭水”，然則她眞的可稱為‘愛國的貴婦’了。（按——一三一頭水，係五洲榮房製品。）</p>
<h3>不同的苦樂</h3>
<p>— 芳鄰</p>
<p>甲乙兩君的家庭，住在同一條馬路上，但是他們兩家却有不同的苦樂。</p>
<p>乙君的家庭，充滿着鬰悶的空氣，他們大人和小孩常常生病，鄰舍時時聽見他們家裏的呻吟，別人常常看到他們家人的愁眉苦臉，因為他們不知注重衛生，有了疾病又調服那無效的藥品，使疾病遷延，所以就造成了這種苦悶的現象。</p>
<p>甲君的家庭，却正和乙君相反，他們家裏充滿着歡樂的空氣，大人和小孩都是康健的，隣舍時常聽見他們家裏的笑話歡騰。……因為他們家裏平素備用五洲藥房的衛生品，很少疾病萬一有病時必定用五洲配製的良藥，所以就大病化小病，小病化無病了。</p>
<h3>風雲章</h3>
<p>— 劉亡</p>
<p>風</p>
<p>在那里，遙遠的故鄉，每當夕陽逗留在疏林的樹梢時，狹長的古道上，就曾有一個年邁的老婦人，在向着路的盡頭悵望。</p>
<p>婦人的年紀眞是太高了，那龍鍾的樣子，緩慢的足步，便可以證明，她是曾在這世上生活過了無盡長的歲月的。艱苦的擔子，是超過了她所能勝任的重量了。為着丈夫，為着兒女，更為着每一個狠心的壓迫者，她終於給許多重負壓彎了背脊。不健壯的小足，年輕時雖曾受過長長的白布的緾裹而减損了力氣，但是當丈夫忙着料理農事的時候，她還是靠着這已非天然的足，帮過了不少忙，代替了不少勞苦的，如今，則是全消失了往昔的強健，走起路來，已是顚跛着了；如果沒有那支拐杖的扶持，説不定，她會由於一點偶然的不愼，而失足跌倒在地上，永遠無法爬起。</p>
<p>傍晚的風，吹得更猛了。牠吹拂過疏林，催下了枯老的黃葉：又吹拂過老婦人的鬢髮，使得那銀白的髮絲，全攪亂了。她舉起枯瘠的手，略略理一理散髮，又挂着拐杖移前了幾步。無神的眼珠子，茫茫然的望着遠處，在那兒，她寄存着一個希望，一份溫暖。她望着遠遠的路的那邊，會走來一個年青人，這年青人不是別個，卽是她數年來日夜繫念着的兒子。</p>
<p>她每天傍晚總是拄着拐杖，懷着很大的希望走來，可是又總是失望地踏着暮色歸去。她那份悽楚，慈惠，沒有人瞭解，也沒有人去作她的慰藉，生命在期望中枯萎，乾涸。</p>
<p>晚風吹着她的銀絲，用桔瘠的手再去梳掠的時候，已是秃得快落盡所有的白髮了。</p>
<p>雲</p>
<p>“浮雲遊子意，落日故人情！”這形容得太過眞切的威傷的詩句，每一次被浪迹在天涯的遊子讀着時，就禁不住愴然流涕。</p>
<p>自然，雲是無情的東西，牠旣不會</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>有自身的情感，且又不能為人們傳達情感。可是，遊子對着牠畢竟難耐其悲懷，這固然是人們情感的寄託而已：不過凈雲的足以象徵遊子，也眞是太相像了</p>
<p>浮雲是沒有足的，所以牠也沒有一定的居留處：只是隨著天風的推動被任意吹向那里。而且浮雲還是多變幻的，牠可以成為雄彎，也可以成為蝴蝶，終於，也許是什麼都全消散了。這正如遊子的無定所的行踪一樣，隨處飄流，隨處生活。歡望愁苦，舒暢，憂患，種種情感在胸中交織着，反而变成了漠然。</p>
<p>無事的時候，或是爲愁慮所苦的時候，常常佇立在空曠的地方，悵望着西天的白雲，往往容易想起故鄉來。飄忽的白雲在緩緩地移動着，這姿態使人想起了白髮老母的遲重的步履。也許這時老母在田塍上望着路的盡頭，等待着遊子歸還吧？而更深的記憶，是那些白雲下，草原上的羊羣。在童稚的時候，是常常放牧在那兒，躺在草原上仰望慣天空的浮雲的，曾經有不少的雄壯的志願與希冀，寄託在白雲深處。如今呢？什麽都没有成就，悵望着飄忽的浮雲，空有滿懷的愧恧，和對於故鄉老母的懷戀而已！</p>
<h3>船</h3>
<p>— 申冰</p>
<p>船載着風，載着浪。船跟風跟浪在格門著。被抓着，摔着，立不定脚跟似地顚躓起來。风劈着船，大海在顫動了。船也變成一個不中用而蠢笨的人，像够不上生活戰鬥的渭水鳥，和蠢笨的企鵝一樣，磚诗情，磚書意也碍海上风暴的風景。</p>
<p>船被拋入絕望中，只看見一世界體盤的海水。</p>
<p>青年的船夫們把着舵，扼着纜，風帆吻着暗色的水，有如白蝶飛向黑蝶。泡沫濺得比船椽高，濺濕了他們的頭，濺濕了他們的胸，直到了風帆吻着暗色的水，船像被摔倒了似地摇荡着，横臥在海的床上，青年的船夫們把着舵。</p>
<p>可是桅桿一斜，船又掙扎起來了。船身水滴淋漓，不勝疲乏似地。船仰着頭衝向海中去，為海水所潑濺，所播弄，傾斜着身子，頭一仰一仆地在激鬥中。風，浪，起，伏，仰仆，海程無限遠。船在絕望中，只看見一世界盈盈的波濤。</p>
<p>船立直了桅，風帆又起了，海上已輕沒有暴風和惡浪。船造成了平謐而勻凈的速度。海水像裙裾的繡邊拖過了船邊，往後流去。船航不出一個永怛的圓圈，從日到夜，又從夜到日是。</p>
<p>是誰。支看頤在聽呢。桅上人語，舟子問起雨和星辰。</p>

<p>梅花雖不是花王。品格清高出衆芳，自古詩人曾品定。花魁甸譽世無雙。那菊是花中之隱逸。蓮稱君子亦相當。周子愛蓮陶愛菊。兩人志趣並非常。不知道，梅花穩逸兼君子。性淑品高貌亦莊。人世多稱桃李好。桃花艷冶李花香。那梅花。只安常。不愿時髦學新妝。艷世風流無俗氣。羞與桃李鬥芬芳。無良媒。亦何傷。藐姑仙子本無郎。山中好友松與竹。夜半清風月與霜。那凡卉只宜聽號令。誰為够先與占春光。所以説，新月舒眉衆星雜。老梅開口百花忙。天荒地老誰知己。只道人間目盡盲。却不料，多情还有林和靖。知音要説孟襄陽。而今国花推定更荣光。</p>

<h3>「富貴榮華」短鏡頭</h3>
<p>爲了做父母的人，都希望自己的子弟將來升官發財，所以所取的名字，大都帶着些吉利，葛福榮和翁世榮，雖然在人家里做養狗的僕人，但他們的名字，却一個呌着「富貴」，一個呌着「榮華」。</p>
<p>人窮命不窮，兩個窮儍瓜却在無意之中中了航空頭奬，實現了他們的名字「富貴榮華」。</p>
<p>中了航空頭奬的兩位窮儍瓜，便把巨欵實行援綏，儍瓜而知愛國，儍瓜而肯愛國，真要愧煞一般漢奸和守財奴了！</p>
<h3>參觀「日出」排演</h3>
<p>自從看過了舞台上的「雷雨」以後，對劇作者曹禺先生，使我起了一種深刻的敬仰與愛好，他那生動尖鋭的筆觸，無情地描繪了現實人生的各方面。「雷雨」不但是作者個人在文藝創作上的成功，同時對中國久已沉寂了的劇壇，更是投下了一個興起的火把。</p>
<p>作者的第二個傑作「日出」在文季月刋上接續發表以後，不僅是引起了愛好「雷雨」的觀衆的注意，同時我們的文壇以及劇壇也起了相當的重視。著名作家如巴金，茅盾，葉聖陶……等，對「日出」都曾發表過嚴正的意見，公認比「雷雨」是更見成功的作品，爲一九三六年劇作上光榮的收穫。</p>
<p>不久以前得到「戲劇工作社」將凖備排演的消息，這是一個很好的喜訊。最近聽説就要上演了，這渴望從此也有實現的可能了。</p>
<p>是前天的一個深夜，因着朋友的相約，特地到該社去參觀一次他們「日出」的排練。一走進門，就感到有一種緊張的空氣在流動，男的女的，充滿了整個屋子，每一個人都在認真他們的工作。導演者歐陽予倩氏全神貫注在演員的動作和台詞上，全體演員在他的指導之下，各自發揮着他表演的天才。演員火部份是「復旦劇社」的舊員，過去他們努力的成績，是無庸介紹的，對舞台經騐都相當豐富，此次「日出」在他們合力苦幹之下，演出的優良，定可逆料。</p>
<p>另外還參觀了一下他們的佈景，都是半截式的，新穎别緻，前所未見，設計該項佈景的是余也愚，褚應堯二君。</p>
<p>據該社負責人説，他們决定公演的日子是：二月二日，地點爲本埠卡爾登大戲院，在滬所演日期爲二三四號三天。</p>
<p>他們都在忙着，不便多所打擾，好在相見的日子不遠了，熱望「日出」的觀衆們，等着吧！</p>

<h3>The Troops of Zhang and Yang Have Not Yet Retreated</h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang is Insistently Demanded to Return to Shaanxi First; Yu Xuezhong is Received in Shaanxi for Consultation; Zhang's Cavalry Attacks Baishui City</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Military news: the troops of Zhang and Yang in the Xi'an area have not yet shown any definite signs of retreat. It is reported that some officers are adamantly insisting that Zhang Xueliang must return to Shaanxi first and address his subordinates before any movement can begin. Therefore, an aircraft has been dispatched to Lanzhou to bring Yu Xuezhong to Shaanxi for joint consultation on a solution. It is also reported that Yu arrived in Xi'an at 11:00 AM on the 31st. When Zhang Xueliang left Shaanxi, he designated Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong to be responsible for presiding over military affairs. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Tongguan: The pseudo-30th Army under the command of the Red Bandit Zhu, Chen Shicai, the pseudo-28th Army under Niu Shushen, and Wu Zhendong's pseudo-Northern Route Army, totaling about 13,000 to 14,000 people, are in the Fushi, Tingchuan, and Wuding River areas in northern Shaanxi. Gao Mazi's gang, numbering over 2,000, is in the Yanchuan and Yichuan areas. They are now preparing to split into three groups for other intrusions, but their direction to the east or south is not yet clear. Many of their personnel collecting grain for security purposes are gathering and transporting it to Tingan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] ㊀ According to an aircraft reconnaissance report on the 31st, in the vicinity of Weinan, from the north bank of the Wei River to the Tianshi Town area, and the line of Lingkou and Ma'e Towns, there is approximately a regiment of Zhang Xueliang's troops constructing fortifications on both sides of the railway. Furthermore, near Xiaoyi Town in northern Wei and from west of Gushi Town to east of Tianshi Town, troops from the other side are also at work. ㊁ On the morning of the 31st, many troops were seen traveling between Weinan and Lintong by aircraft. There were five to six hundred people at Ba Bridge, resting. A battalion of soldiers was traveling from Xi'an to Xianyang, and more than a dozen large carts were heading from Xianyang to Liquan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The aftermath of the Shaanxi situation has encountered twists and turns because a small number of troops in the 106th Division disobeyed orders. According to sources, this should not affect the progress of the settlement. (Special dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] News from the railway: The Longhai Railway engineering team has gone west to repair the Chishui and Wei River bridges. Once the Central Army takes over defense of Xi'an, the railway can be opened to traffic. (Special dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Tongguan news: The retreat of Yang's troops is slow and hesitant. The Central Army is still taking a serious monitoring attitude to prevent Yang from making other changes. Our aircraft are flying reconnaissance daily. (Special dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The situation in Shaanxi is sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed, but the Central Government is still adhering to a policy of leniency, urging them to finally come to their senses. According to reports on the morning of the 31st, telegraph and telephone communications between Tongguan and Xi'an are barely functional. There has been wind and snow between Tongguan and Xi'an in recent days, and the front line is peaceful. The Central Army is still taking a monitoring attitude. Mi Chunlin, He Zhuguo, Xie Ke, and Li Zhigang, the representative of Yang Hucheng, are still in Tongguan on the 31st, discussing everything in detail with Director Gu Zhutong. It is also learned that Shen Ke's unit of the 106th Division clashed with another unit while crossing the river at Sunyi and Gushi on the 30th, confronting each other across the river with gunfire. Troops were also reinforced on the Chishui side at the same time. The situation with Zhang's troops is quite complicated, and a small number of junior officers are disobeying the orders of their superiors. Yang's troops are relatively simpler. (Special dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Although the solution conditions agreed upon between the Central Government and Yang in Shaanxi stipulate that the troops of Zhang and Yang must withdraw from all front lines, the overall situation is still very chaotic. The government forces have clashed with the troops of the 105th Division, which is under the command of Zhang Xueliang, but it is not known whether the conflict was accidental, whether the peaceful negotiations have broken down again, or whether the Red Bandits are now interfering with the implementation of the solution conditions. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Telegraph communications between Tianjin and Shaanxi were disrupted again from the 31st. (Special dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Tongguan: The 10th Cavalry Division of Zhang's troops has now dispatched soldiers from Hanbing Town, north of Pucheng, to besiege Baishui County. This is because the county's security guards and various teams refused the entry of the troops, and both sides are fighting. It is also reported that Fuping County, fearing harassment from Zhang's troops and extortion of rations from local bandits, has gathered guards and closed the city to prevent them from entering. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Personally Presiding Over Diplomatic Negotiations in Hebei-Chahar</h3>
<p>Negotiations to Conclude Before Returning to Peiping; Li Sihao Arrived in Peiping Yesterday from Tianjin</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Song Zheyuan has decided to stay in Tianjin for the Spring Festival and to work on current diplomatic matters in Tianjin. Before Jia Deyao assumes the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs Committee of Hebei-Chahar and with Chen Juesheng ill, Song is personally handling all negotiations. He is engaging with the other side based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, upholding the conditions of the Central Government, and negotiations will conclude before his return to Peiping. (Special dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Lu Zongyu came to Tianjin from Peiping on the 1st to assist Li Sihao in visiting Ikeda and others again to jointly discuss concrete measures for the restoration of the Longyan Mine. (Special dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>[Peiping] Li Sihao arrived in Peiping at midnight tonight. According to reports, his trip to Tianjin was to see Song; he did not meet with Sakatani. Negotiations on the development of the North China economy have not yet begun. The Longyan Iron Mine matter is currently under investigation. Song will return to Peiping in two weeks, and Yu will go to Tianjin again after the Spring Festival. (Special dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie Departs Beijing to Return North</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie, having completed his business in Beijing, took a train at 4:20 PM on the 31st to Jinan, from where he will return to Qingdao. (Special dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Gansu Students Arrive in Beijing to Report on the Recent Situation in Shaanxi and Gansu</h3>
<p>Four Rows of Trenches Dug Between Gaoling and Dali; Wooden Bridge Built Over the Wei River for Easy Troop Passage; Schools in Xi'an Open as Usual</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Shaanxi students Shi Bingzhong and Wang Zhongzhi departed from Lanzhou on the 14th and arrived in Beijing on the 31st, passing through Lintao, Longxi, Tianshui, Longzhou, and then Fengxiang, Guozhen, Xi'an, Sanyuan, Gaoling, Dali, Chaoyi, Tongguan in Shaanxi. According to their account, starting at 7:00 PM on December 12th, the 113th Division under the command of Yu Xuezhong, led by Li Zhentang, suddenly launched a revolt in the city of Lanzhou, occupying the provincial capital's Public Security Bureau and the Pacification Commissioner's Office.史铭, the director of the Public Security Bureau, was immediately detained. Yang Jigao, an advisor to the Pacification Commissioner's Office (from Tianshui), was searched and killed by rioting soldiers at 8:00 PM that night. Senior official Wang Shihui was also shot dead in front of the Pacification Commissioner's Office. Police and Zhu Shaoliang's guards came out to resist, resulting in many deaths and injuries. By 8:30 AM the next morning, the riot was quelled, but inspections of pedestrians at the four gates were extremely strict. It was not until Yu Xuezhong flew back to Lanzhou from Xi'an on the 15th that the situation returned to normal. However, there is a shortage of food. The usual price of wheat was around four yuan per dou (100 catties), but now it sells for fourteen yuan, and there is nowhere to buy it. Food shops are also not open. During the most chaotic time, the Yellow River water that Lanzhou residents drank sold for eight jiao of silver dollars per dan. All schools, large, medium, and small, were closed, and all students returned to their hometowns. There is still no date for reopening. The army stationed in the city is still requisitioning carts, and people do not dare to go out. Mule carts do not dare to enter the city. Xu Xianshi, the director of the Construction Department, Liu Guangpei, the director of Civil Affairs, and Tian Jiongjin, the director of Education, are maintaining the current situation in Lanzhou, but there is nothing they can do. Inquiries into the troops stationed in Shaanxi and Gansu reveal the following: 1. Gansu: In the Lanzhou area, there is the 113th Division of Zhang's forces under Li Zhentang. In Dingxi, there are the 118th Division of Zhang's forces under Zhou Guanglie, and Mou's 114th Division. 2. Shaanxi: The first and second security brigades of Yang Hucheng are stationed in Xi'an, and the third security brigade of Yang's forces is stationed in Gaoling and Dali in northern Shaanxi. Four rows of trenches have been dug from east of Gaoling to twenty li west of Dali, most of which are occupied by bandit troops of the Communist bandits. Their clothes are incomplete, but their military caps are all the same, made of dark blue cloth with a very shallow back brim and a large front brim for sun protection. All caps have red badges as symbols. From Xi'an to Sanyuan, it is necessary to cross the Wei River. Previously, there were no bridges, and people used ferries to cross the river. Now, Yang has ordered his subordinates to build wooden bridges on the Wei River for easy troop passage. However, the people still cannot use this bridge to cross the river and must use ferries. Schools in Xi'an are open as usual. The Shaanxi Tax Bureau has encountered difficulties in its work due to the Shaanxi Incident. Staff have successively left Shaanxi for Tongguan, where a temporary office was established on the 27th to handle tax affairs. (Special dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng's Remarks</h3>
<p>Resorting to Force Only as a Last Resort</p>
<p>Tongguan: On the 30th, a reporter visited Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng at Yangcun and asked for his opinion on the Northwestern issues from the Central Government. He made the following remarks: ㊀ Question: Recently, Yang Hucheng and others in Xi'an do not seem to have any sense of awakening. The national public opinion believes that it is necessary to use force to resolve the situation as soon as possible. What do you think? Answer: This time, the Central Government is completely based on a spirit of leniency and sincerity towards the Northwest problem, hoping to achieve a political solution. This is known to the whole country. As for the use of force, this is the most unfortunate thing. It will not be used unless absolutely necessary. Observing the situation in Xi'an in the past month, it is impossible not to prepare for any eventuality, but the hope is that preparation is not used. If the Xi'an side can sincerely accept the orders of the Central Government, there is no need for military action, and their past actions can be forgiven in general. They will still be protected and will not be discriminated against in any way. However, if they are still controlled by a small number of reactionary elements and resist the Central Government, making the Central Government exhaust its sincerity and ultimately despair, then it will only have to make forceful corrections based on the needs of the nation and the demands of the people of the whole country, to promote their final awakening. It must be known that the Northwest is related to the entire national defense, and Xi'an is an important town in the Northwest. It must not be allowed to split, and even more, it must not be allowed to become a base for instigating internal strife and communizing China. As for the individual, I only know that I am carrying out my duties by adhering to the will of the Central Government, obeying the orders of my superiors, and executing my duties. I do not ask about anything else. ㊁ Question: Have the bandits and puppets in eastern Suiyuan been active in recent years, and does the Central Government have any plans? Answer: Before Chahar province is recovered, the base of the bandits and puppets disturbing Suiyuan cannot be eliminated, and there is a possibility of them coming to disturb us at any time. The Central Government has a whole plan and certain steps for the bandits and puppets in eastern Suiyuan. Not only should the territory of Suiyuan Province be thoroughly cleared, but for the safety of eastern Suiyuan, Chahar, the bandit nest that the bandits and puppets use as a base for disturbing eastern Suiyuan, must also be recovered. Otherwise, eastern Suiyuan and northern Hebei will never have a peaceful day. What makes me the most painful about this Xi'an Incident is that the suppression of bandits in Suiyuan was progressing steadily, but the plan to clear Chahar province was shattered by this incident. Now, although the officers and soldiers on the front line are still making active preparations, they cannot but have worries about the rear. A certain general on the front line once said that the Xi'an side is acting so perverse. What battles are we fighting in Suiyuan? We must first return to Xi'an to resolve the situation. Although this was just a moment of anger from a certain general, the close relationship between the war of resistance on the front line and the unification of the rear can be imagined. In short, resisting the enemy and defending against insult is a matter of burying oneself in practical work and preparing to sacrifice, and it cannot be achieved by a momentary emotional impulse, let alone by borrowing a name to show off. This is what I personally hope to share with the people of the country, to encourage each other. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>He Jian Sends Telegram Requesting the Promotion of Ethical Principles</h3>
<p>[Changsha] On the 30th, He Jian sent a telegram to the Central Government requesting the promotion of ethical principles and the upholding of Confucius's doctrine of centrality and rectitude to establish the foundation for universal harmony. His original telegram stated: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government: The aftermath of Xi'an has been unresolved for a long time. The Red Bandits are growing stronger, heterodoxies are emerging, and the people are perplexed to the extreme. I believe that internal pacification and external resistance are a necessary sequence. Suppressing chaos and resisting aggression are the normal course of saving the nation. Once national policies are set, daily progress will be made. Such things as the collapse of bandit forces, diplomatic victories, and the victory of the Suiyuan battle are all obvious facts. If one is swayed by complex words and uses a crooked yardstick, then the great cause of unification, which has been cultivated for ten years, and the common trust of hundreds of millions of people, what means will be used to maintain it? Forcing a square peg into a round hole is not allowed by the situation. Changing the rules and listening easily will only lead to division. Moreover, international situations are changing, and alliances are unpredictable. Gaining a little and losing a lot, what is the point? This is what I am worried and fearful about. The melons of the Huangtai cannot be picked again. The situation of unification should be maintained. Resolving the root cause and the symptoms can be done later. I have heard that when sages establish teachings, they emphasize ethical principles first. When a country seeks survival, it must first have discipline. Correcting discipline is the basis for defining positions, and clarifying ethics is the basis for loving the people. This is the traditional spirit of our country, that is, Confucius's great way of governing the country. The late Premier recognized the truth for all time and respected the way of Confucius. President Chiang personally practices the principles of the state, and the people are grateful. Following the instructions of the predecessors and learning from their effects, the path is almost clear. However, in recent years, the morale of scholars has been impetuous, and people have harbored desires. First, they established heterodoxies to seize fame, and then they used conspiracies to seize profits. One voice started a thousand echoes, and emptiness became the norm. The collapse of propriety and righteousness has led to this situation. The new and old ethical principles should be tailored to the needs of the time. If they can cure the disease, why avoid the established formula? If ethical principles are not correct, then the law will lose its severity. If the virtue of the people is not strong, then politics and education will have no roots. How can we govern the people of five races and align the products of all things? Moreover, the countries of Europe and the United States, whether dictatorial or democratic, have each gone to extremes, have lost the old model of the constitution, and have fallen into a dark and desperate path. They are only trying to put out the fire in front of their eyebrows. Who cares about the long term? If we promote Confucius's doctrine of centrality and rectitude to establish the foundation for universal harmony, and create our own laws so that the people are not confused, then humanity will be fortunate and peace can be expected. I am concerned about the difficulties of the times and the course of the country. I occasionally think about the future and increase the anxiety in my heart. Do not say that my words are close to commonplace and that people will criticize them as being old-fashioned. However, because the matter concerns the fundamental principles of governance, I have not dared to hesitate to speak. I respectfully ask the noble headquarters and the noble government, with their brilliant guidance that all the people look up to, to plan great strategies to consolidate the foundation of the country. If you appreciate my foolish sincerity and find it worthwhile, I will then propose detailed methods and make them public for discussion. I humbly request your consideration. He Jian." (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>The Puppet Troops in Northern Chahar are Actively Replenishing Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Smoke Bombs and Poison Gas Transported; Wang Ying and Zhang Wanqing Confirmed to be Dismissed</p>
<p>[Guihua] Although the puppet troops in northern Chahar have been focusing on defense in recent days, they are still actively replenishing military supplies. According to a report from the front on the 31st, a certain party transported sixteen truckloads of smoke bombs and poison gas from Duolun to Zhangbei. In order to unify command, a certain party has renamed all the puppet troops in northern Chahar as the Mongol-Han People's National Salvation Army. It is said that they are currently being organized. Wang Ying's bandit division has been reduced to three regiments, totaling about 1,200 people, and is temporarily under the command of Li Shouxin. (Special dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] The bandits and puppets in northern Chahar are claiming to launch a large-scale westward attack within the year. The national army in eastern Suiyuan has been on strict alert for days, and the situation is quite serious. The reorganization of Wang Ying's and Zhang Wanyou's troops has been completed. On the evening of the 29th, more than 300 soldiers from Zhang's troops in Nanhogian staged a mutiny and plundered villages. Zhang was therefore placed under surveillance by a certain party, and there are reports that he has been suspended from duty for three months. Puppet troops from Rehe have been dispatched to Jiabusi and Nanhogian to reinforce them in recent days. (Special dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>[Guihua] A certain military officer came to Suiyuan from Xinghe and Dalun on the morning of the 31st. According to his account: ㊀ The two bandits Wang Ying and Zhang Wanqing have indeed been dismissed by a certain party. Ma Houyuan, the puppet brigade commander of Zhang's bandit group, and Sun Zhaoming, the chief of the puppet military affairs office, have fled and their whereabouts are unknown. Wang's bandit group is under surveillance, and his death is unknown. ㊁ Zhang's bandit group has a total of three regiments, one of which, with 600-700 unarmed soldiers, was forcibly dismissed by a certain party. On the way, they were stripped of their cotton-padded clothes, leaving only their underwear. The cruelty is unspeakable. The remaining two regiments, Zhang Shiying's and Jiang Zibin's, are commanded by Zhang Shiying under the name of detachment commander. ㊂ A regiment of troops from a certain party is currently stationed outside the east gate of Nanhogian, and two regiments of Zhang Shiying's bandits are stationed in the city. A regiment of Li Shouxin's cavalry is stationed in the suburbs. They are mutually suspicious and closely monitored. The west, north, and south city gates have been sealed for a long time, and only the east gate is left open for entry and exit. However, it is also closed every night at 7:00 PM to prevent the puppet troops in the city from fleeing. Barbed wire is densely laid out at nearby intersections for security. ㊃ On the evenings of the 25th and 26th, there was a firefight between the bandits inside and outside the city, resulting in more than ten deaths and injuries. The dire situation can be seen from this. ㊄ On the 27th, two armored vehicles from a certain party suddenly drove to Xiaojingzi, attempting to attack the national army's defense line. They were discovered and repelled. ㊅ The number of bandits and puppet troops surrendering to the national army has been continuous. In recent weeks, there have been hundreds of people and more than 80 horses. ㊆ Dalun is thirty to forty li away from Shangdu and Nanhogian and is the front line of eastern Suiyuan. The national army is on very strict alert. Brigade Commander Wang Zixiu has postponed his visit to Suiyuan due to the tight defense situation there. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>

<h3>Guangdong Chamber of Commerce Again Requests Relief for Guangdong Rice Shortage</h3>
<p>Foreign rice tax to be waived for half a year; income tax for various industries</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] The Guangdong Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Chairman Lin of the National Government, President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Director of the Guangdong Pacification Commission Yu Hanmou, and Chairman Huang Musong of the Provincial Government on the 31st, stating that the Central Government has allowed the Ministry of Railways to allocate trains to transport rice and approved the increase of foreign rice to 1 million dan on account at half price. The good intentions of relief are not without merit. However, the number of vehicles is limited, and transportation takes time. The cost of accounting at half price is still heavy. In practice, it has no great benefit. Looking at the current price of rice, it has not yet trended down. With the eagerness of 30 million people waiting for food and the breadth of 94 counties in the famine area, small favors cannot be universally applied. The cost of rice is still high in the cities, so the suffering in the poor countryside is imaginable. Completely waiving the foreign rice tax in Guangdong Province for half a year is not enough to achieve the actual effect of relief, etc. The chamber also believes that the business tax rate of the Finance Department is too high and difficult to implement, and has decided to convene a provincial representative meeting on February 16 to discuss it.

<h3>A Year of High Speed</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Since January of this year, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has launched express trains, and the Longxing steamer of the Sanbei Company, sailing between Shanghai and Hankou, has also shortened its voyage and been converted to an express service. Such a situation shows that the transportation sector is fully accelerating its development and fully demonstrating progress. Therefore, some people propose calling this year a year of high speed.</p>
<p>Looking back on the past, the progress of various constructions in our country has indeed been very slow. Compared with other countries, the difference is always more than ten years. If we want national rejuvenation and sufficient national strength, we must naturally step up our efforts in domestic construction. The so-called catching up must be done quickly, and even more quickly. Therefore, this year being a year of high speed not only hopes that the transportation sector will progress quickly, but also hopes that various undertakings will also develop rapidly.</p>
<p>Railways, shipping and telecommunications are all important tools in transportation. Railways have express trains, shipping has express services, and telecommunications should also be fast and express. However, telecommunications traffic is accelerating at any time, but it does not call for express or express, and there is no need to add the name of express or express, because telecommunications itself focuses on speed, and the speed of its transmission, the responsiveness of its response, and the sender and speaker know it, and the society is no stranger to it.</p>
<p>Although telecommunications does not need to be marked as express or express, the progress of telecommunications can be secretly combined with express or express everywhere. If we also follow the example of railways and ships and call it a year of high speed, then the so-called year of high speed should not start from now. Since 1932, telecommunications has gradually progressed, especially in the last three years, the progress has been even more rapid. The increase in transmission speed and the expansion of the scope of communication have shrunk thousands of miles into marbles and connected the two places like face-to-face meetings. In the blink of an eye, how fast is it? If we talk about its important facilities, long-distance telephone calls are open to nine provinces, and the communication is convenient. Domestic and foreign wireless electricity also reports as far as all countries in the world. Shanghai, Hankou and Shanghai and Guangdong have also installed wireless telephones. In addition, in terms of telegraphs, important cities in China have also been successively re-equipped with Cretet printing telegraphs. All telephone calls and newspapers are more convenient and faster than before. It is impossible to say that the construction in the past few years has resulted in such a result, but it is fast and express. Continue to work hard, a fast and everything is fast, railways and ships are like this, and what about telecommunications alone?</p>
<h3>Two New Measures for Domestic Long-Distance Telephone of the Ministry of Communications (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pu Zhan</p>
<p>New Year's New Contribution</p>
<p>People cannot be always quiet and motionless, so human affairs are also changing. Users have already installed telephones, and have registered with the telephone bureau, paid long-distance telephone deposits, or filled out applications for connecting to long-distance telephones, which is convenient for transmitting and receiving long-distance telephones, but occasionally they encounter something to negotiate outside, and urgently need to send long-distance telephones to discuss with relations in distant places, or some people whose service locations are uncertain every day and need to send long-distance calls at any time, unfortunately, the telephone installed in the place is not registered with the telephone bureau. According to the current regulations that unregistered user telephones cannot transmit long-distance telephones, at this time, you must go back to the self-installed telephone that has been registered, or go to the nearby long-distance telephone retail store, register and wait for the call, during which the loss of time is not to be said. If you encounter an important event, you must deal with it on the spot, and when you cannot spare yourself, it will inevitably lead to consideration of this and loss of the other, and the loss will be even greater! With the method of registered users being able to borrow opportunities to speak, after that, you only need to apply to the telephone bureau and list the call fees on the call fee account of the self-installed and registered telephone, and be responsible for paying. All telephones within the same municipal telephone business area can be borrowed to speak at any time and anywhere, which is not only the labor of going back and forth, but also the feeling of not delaying the opportunity, and there is no loss of time and economy, which can be described as killing several birds with one stone. At the same time, because the regulations on the method stipulate that the speaker must notify the self-installed and registered telephone in advance before the speaker registers for the call, tell him that he intends to borrow a certain telephone number, transmit a long-distance telephone to a certain place, and then the telephone bureau inquires the telephone listener of the self-installed and registered telephone designated by the speaker to pay for the call once before connecting the call, which can ensure that no one is speaking in the name of another person, and the idea is very thoughtful.</p>
<p>As for the speaker or receiver who calls someone to talk is out for business, if the speaker or receiver knows where the speaker or receiver is now, and there is also a telephone installed at the limb, the telephone number can be informed to the telephone bureau to change the connection, and the method is the same as the method of the speaker who can borrow the machine to speak, and there is a similarity in different ways; In general people's habits, long-distance telephones are rarely used without urgent and important matters, so when the receiver is out and encounters a long-distance call, although the receiving user knows where the speaker is, he cannot immediately call back to answer the call, so as to explain what kind of important event this call is, or the speaker registers and then has to go out urgently for some important matter and cannot wait for the call, and the feeling of frustration can be imagined. With this method, as long as there is a telephone installed, you can change the connection without adding extra costs, and the difficult problem can be solved easily. Therefore, these two methods can be called modern methods in the modern era. (End)</p>
<h3>Use a Long-Distance Telephone or Telegraph?</h3>
<p>— Shan Ronghai</p>
<p>Modern society people, the entire use of telecommunications and traffic, is because of its many types, and do not know how to choose. That is, which should send a long-distance telephone? Which should send a telegram? Fang Shi is in line with the economic conditions of operation. Regarding this point, if there is no experience in discernment, it is often because a telephone should be sent and a telegram is sent, or a telegram should be sent and a telephone is sent, resulting in a reduction in the effectiveness of the use of telecommunications and traffic, and becoming a loss of economy and time. I would like to say a word here, and make a small contribution:</p>
<p>If we want to properly solve the above problem, we should first analyze and compare the nature and advantages of telephones and telegrams. Which one is more suitable to use? The analysis is as follows:</p>
<p>Looking at the table on the right, we can know that telephones and telegrams have their own advantages and disadvantages in mutual comparison. Therefore, social people, for the choice of using telecommunications and traffic, may as well follow the different advantages and disadvantages of the two tools listed in the above table, and the starting point of their needs, and make a decision after review. That is, all those who tend to be physical and time-sensitive, such as bank remittances, etc., should send telegrams. On the contrary, those who pay attention to immediately waiting for a reply to solve a certain event can log on to a long-distance telephone. The above discussion is just an example. When people in society are accustomed to using the two, they will know what to choose.</p>
<h3>Promulgation of Measures for Guiding the Broadcasting of Programs by National Radio Stations</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhen</p>
<p>The programs broadcast by local private radio stations every day often focus on recreational aspects, and often adopt low-grade songs and lyrics and superstitious and absurd stories, which not only fail to achieve the grand effect of radio education, but also inevitably have the drawbacks of teaching obscenity and theft. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications specially formulated the "Measures for Guiding the Broadcasting of Programs by National Radio Stations," which were promulgated and implemented on October 28, 1936. The measures have been distributed by the Ministry of Communications to the telecommunications bureaus in Beiping, Hankou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuxian, Wuxi, Tongshan, Gaoyou, Yin County, Shaoyu, Wuchao, Xiamen, and Wujin, etc., so that the local private radio stations will earnestly abide by them to comply with the law. The broadcasting stations run by local government agencies must also abide by the same measures, and the Ministry of Communications has separately requested the governments and municipal governments of all provinces to investigate and order them to implement them at the same time to return to a unified approach.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned "Contents of the Measures for Guiding the Broadcasting of Programs by National Radio Stations" are divided into the following items:</p>
<p>1. Regarding the procedures for arranging programs, each radio station (including public and private radio stations) shall pre-compile a program schedule of the type of broadcast programs and the broadcast time, and send it to the Broadcasting Industry Guidance Committee of the Central Executive Committee for review and approval in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Communications before it can be broadcast. If the program needs to be changed in the future, it must also be reported for approval before it can be implemented again. Each radio station should also compile a forecast of the program content on a light basis, and include the title of each program broadcast every day (such as the lecture title, drama song name) and the name of the person in charge, and the planned broadcast time (such as someone lecturing on the recent international situation at a certain time on a certain day, and a certain song and dance troupe singing a certain famous song) and other items in detail in the table and submit it to the Central Broadcasting Industry Guidance Committee for review. If it is necessary to change it, the Central Broadcasting Industry Guidance Committee may notify it to correct it. Each radio station shall limit the changes, additions, deletions, or temporary suspensions of the pre-scheduled programs to no more than one-fifth of the daily programs due to unavoidable accidents. Each radio station shall rebroadcast the broadcasting programs of the Central Broadcasting Station (such as the speeches of party and state dignitaries) in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Communications during the broadcasting program time. Those who do not have the equipment for rebroadcasting shall report the suspension of rebroadcasting. Whenever the Central Broadcasting Station has particularly important programs that the Central Broadcasting Industry Guidance Committee deems necessary to rebroadcast. The Ministry of Communications may notify it to handle it at any time, but at most one program per day shall be rebroadcast.</p>
<p>2. Regarding the allocation and selection of program content, the daily broadcast time allocated to each public radio station shall be mostly about propaganda education lectures. Private radio stations shall not be less than 40% of the propaganda education lecture programs, and the entertainment programs shall not exceed 60% at most. All commercial advertisements requested to be broadcast by various merchants shall be included in the entertainment programs, but the broadcast time shall not exceed one-third of the entertainment program time (for example, if the broadcast time of the entertainment program is 30 minutes, the time for inserting advertisements and broadcasts in the middle of each record shall not exceed 10 minutes if calculated cumulatively.) In addition to entertainment programs, each radio station shall broadcast propaganda education lecture programs in Mandarin in principle. Those who temporarily use local dialects for broadcasting should also add Mandarin teaching programs.</p>
<p>Each radio station must carefully select the programs broadcast every day. Any opinions that violate the prohibition or are ideologically biased, as well as stories, songs, and lyrics that are close to teaching obscenity, theft, or superstition and absurdity, shall not be broadcast. Otherwise, the Ministry of Communications may give a warning or order to stop broadcasting depending on the severity of the circumstances, in order to show no punishment.</p>
<p>3. Regarding the correction and regulation of broadcast time, the time for each radio station to broadcast programs shall be based on the specified standard time of each district. This standard time shall be checked against the time reported by the Central Broadcasting Station every day. In addition, if there are more than five radio stations with 100 watts or more in the same urban area or county town, the time for broadcasting programs of radio stations with less than 100 watts in the area shall be restricted, and the Ministry of Communications shall order them to know them at any time, and shall not exceed them.</p>
<p>4. Regarding the crackdown on those who do not abide by the regulations, if any radio station in any place fails to earnestly abide by the "Measures for Guiding the Broadcasting of Programs by National Radio Stations," the Ministry of Communications may give a warning or crackdown, or even order it to stop broadcasting or revoke its license, depending on the severity of the circumstances.</p>
<p>After the above-mentioned "Measures for Guiding the Broadcasting of Programs by National Radio Stations" are promulgated and implemented, each radio station has something to follow in the arrangement, allocation, and selection of programs, and it should not be the case that the chapter regulations are violated again, and it is taken upon itself. Therefore, this journal is happy to introduce the measures for the public to read. (End)</p>
<h3>The Factors and Characteristics of Formally Written Social Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Shan Ronghai</p>
<p>Formally written social telegrams are a unique product of our country in the telegraph business. The meaning of advocating this kind of telegraph business is nothing more than the following three points: ㊀ The transmission of telegrams uses symbols as representatives of characters, which is the most important key when telegraphers first invented them, and so far this decision has not been overturned, and another method has been changed (the now invented fax telegram is popular in Europe and the United States, but because of the high cost and organization, it has not been widely promoted, so no matter what, it can never become the main organization in the structure of the telegraph business in our country.) Therefore, the structure of a country's writing in the telegraph business is extremely important. However, the organization of Chinese characters is not as simple as that of European and American characters, so in terms of telegraph transmission, four numbers are still used as the basis for the change of telegraph symbols (the now invented Chinese telegraph typewriter and the national phonetic telegraph, etc. have not been widely implemented, so they are not discussed here). Therefore, in the organization of telegraph writing, it must be one word and four codes, and there is no way to increase or decrease them, so it is impossible to make the text short. ㊁ Our country has been called the land of etiquette and righteousness since ancient times. For the grand ceremonies of weddings and funerals, all the etiquette is different from that of Europe and the United States, and the various meanings expressed in writing are different for relatives and children. Therefore, it is almost impossible to write a social letter or a small announcement without being old in social interaction. ㊂ Our country's telegraph business has been developing rapidly in recent years due to the rectification of the authorities and the efforts of employees across the country, but due to cost reasons, the current telegraph price is set. Except for telegraphs in this province, which have been reduced by 30%, there is no way to reduce it further, and the general public is mostly affected by the decline in domestic production and the downturn in business. There are very few people who use telegrams to communicate, so domestic telegraph business has not been able to develop as much as possible under this situation. It was not until the promulgation of the domestic social telegram method in August 1933 that the general merchants became interested in sending telegrams. However, from the perspective of precise statistics, the social telegram, on the one hand, has a low fee, which is inevitable to lose costs, and on the other hand, if the number of words exceeds the specified number, the newspaper fee must still be added, and the economic strength is somewhat insufficient, and there are two shortcomings. Therefore, there is the creation of the establishment of formally written social telegrams.</p>
<p>Regarding formally written social telegrams, in the telegraph accumulation in our view, the reason why it has become a creation is based on the above-mentioned three points, so the result of its implementation also has the following three characteristics:</p>
<p>㊀ Our country's telegraph prices cannot be reduced further due to food and salt relations. In terms of the hearts of ordinary people, sending a telegram for Liu Yu is only required for major China reasons. Now, Ernei's formally written social telegram adopts a fixed low transfer price, which is convenient for any class in society to have the opportunity to use, and can be used to arouse the public's interest and habit of sending electricity universally.</p>
<p>㊁ Our country's pin meeting situation is extremely brainy and frugal. Today's domestic formally written social telegram, although it is a piece of telegraph text, must imagine the grand intention of the sender hundreds of thousands of miles away when receiving the telegram in the receiver's spirit, and be entangled in endless excitement. On the sender's side, it feels easy and not restricted by everything in time, space, and material trade.</p>
<p>㊂ The social interaction of the generation has really tended to be close to one of the written sides, that is, the spiritual interaction, which has increased in matter. Therefore, Wei Ci is more linked, etc., and has been praised by the general public. However, most of the hair and industrial civilians still do not have this kind of elegant thinking power. Today's domestic branch-textual view of telegrams, the wording and sentence are all drafted for you, and the various forms and colors are all adjacent. The person who reports the news only needs to review it, and he can grasp the hair. Even in the intellectual world, it is easy to unload the sweet time.</p>
<p>Domestic formally written social regular reports have the above-mentioned factors and advantages. We broaden our vision and observe them. They are not only a kind of era product that facilitates a twist of the people and sends out zero reports, but also make great efforts to improve the social interaction system and embellish the folk culture.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Ministry of Communications' Rectification of Northwest Telecommunications</h3>
<p>Expansion of Counties and Addition of Lanzhou Radio Station</p>
<p>Zikai Prefecture is an important town in the northwest. In recent years, Bianjiang Radio Stations, which have been established in the areas of Gansu and Ning, have a large number. Lan Gu, the middle leaf of the ancient town, is extremely important? The original motor has been severely outnumbered, and the distribution is uneven. Now, a 5 million special wireless motor is specially added to sell and enrich it.</p>
<p>Reorganization of Jin-Sui Agencies</p>
<p>Since the Sui incident occurred, Junxun has been frequent in Jin-Cai and all of her. The original telecommunications organization has been simplified, and the need is difficult to meet. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications has carefully considered the actual situation and the political improvement. All the Yanggao, Zhenxian, and Yuanping three agency courts in Shanxi, and the Longsheng, Xinghe, Dongcheng, Huailai, and Chai Jiangbao five agency courts in Sui, have been reorganized into business offices, and personnel have been sent by the telecommunications bureau to take over. In addition, all the telegrams transmitted in the above-mentioned places used to use telephone sewing, and now all of them have been replaced with Mo Xun tearing newspapers to benefit the report.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Contradictions Demonstrated in the Seventieth Session of Parliament (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Nanyun</p>
<p>This is the reason why the Seiyukai only proposed reducing the budget by 300 million yuan, and also the reason why the Minseito paid special attention to "diplomatic failure." It is difficult to expect these two major parties to be tough on the government to the end. In the end, they cannot but sacrifice the interests of the public. This is the weakness of Japanese political parties, and also the objective condition that Japanese political parties are bound to decline and inevitably become divided.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter how tough political parties are at present, this toughness will only be a shout. This is similar to an unhealthy interim economic boom, and it will never be able to save itself from decline, nor will it be able to prevent Japan's right-wing politics—deeply non-parliamentary and non-partisan politics. The so-called attempt to revive parliamentary politics is now being trampled on by the national defense-first principle in extraordinary times. What will replace parliamentary politics will be rapidly fascistic politics.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>Within the two major political parties, since the military proposed the parliamentary reform plan last October, there has been a division between the self-respecting faction and the hard-line faction. The hard-line faction opposes fascism, demands the regeneration of political parties, and advocates a vote of no confidence in the current cabinet in order to attack fascist forces. Those who participated in this faction included Saito Takao of the Minseito and Hamada Kunimatsu of the Seiyukai...etc. Most of the self-respecting faction are cadres of the two parties, who advocate that political parties should be cautious and should consider the impact on the political situation when fighting against the government. From these two factions' different viewpoints, we can see the internal contradictions among Japanese capitalists at this stage. Moreover, due to the strengthening of internal contradictions among capitalists, the recent tough anti-government attitude of political parties has been formed.</p>
<p>At the Eastern Chamber of Commerce New Year's banquet on January 14, some capitalists severely criticized Arita's failed diplomacy. At the Economic Federation's New Year's banquet on the 18th, Ohashi Shintaro (industrial capitalist, member of the House of Peers) rose to give a speech, expressing his dissatisfaction with the huge budget. From this speech, it was revealed that the anti-government atmosphere among the powerful members of the "Japan Industrial Club" and the capitalists centered on the "All-Industry Federation" was unexpectedly strong. In addition, at the Okura Group's New Year's banquet on the 19th, Mr. Masuda Giichi, a member of the Minseito and a businessman, also gave an extremely indignant speech, vehemently opposing the Baba finances. About 500 capitalists attended the banquet that day, and all applauded and approved of Masuda Giichi's claims. The tension in the atmosphere was unprecedented in Tokyo's financial circles in recent years. Even some capitalists related to the military-industrial complex expressed concern about the famine and soaring prices of raw materials, as well as the increase in labor wages, and expressed their willingness to support established political parties and resist the government to the death! (January 21—Tokyo Yomiuri)</p>
<p>On the other hand? The progress of the new political party movement is also very active. Minister of the Army Terauchi once said to Prince Konoe (Speaker of the Japanese House of Peers): "This time the parliament has a very dangerous atmosphere. There is no hope for established political parties, and only the realization of an innovative new political party can be expected. Please do your best for the country." (November 19—Tokyo Asahi)</p>
<p>At the same time, the following news was also published in the Tokyo Yomiuri on January 20:</p>
<p>At a time when political parties are standing at a major crossroads of life and death, the reform faction within the political parties is carrying out a new political party movement in extreme secrecy. The central figures of the new party movement are Nakajima Kujirahei (a member of the Seiyukai, a graduate of the Naval Machinery School, director of the aircraft manufacturing plant, and a member of the self-respecting faction in the Seiyukai), Maeda Yonezo (the current Minister of Railways in the government, an incumbent cabinet member of the Seiyukai), and Count Arima Yoriyasu and Count Kodama Hideo, both members of the House of Peers. The main points of building a new party are the following two:</p>
<p>(1) In order to attempt the reconstruction of parliamentary politics, it is necessary to rely on a new system of military-civilian unity and cooperation to implement strong politics.</p>
<p>(2) Give full play to the true essence of constitutional politics, reject the so-called constitutional routine, fundamentally eliminate political parties, sweep away the corrupt and degenerate phenomena from the past, and establish the mother of constitutional politics under the fresh spirit of Japanism.</p>
<p>The members of the new party movement have already called on Minister of the Army Terauchi and Minister of the Navy Nagano to request spiritual support. It is rumored that the president of the new party will be one of the following: Prince Konoe, General Hayashi Senjuro, General Ugaki Kazushige, and General Minami Jiro.</p>
<p>(VI)</p>
<p>Based on the various facts mentioned above, Japan after the seventieth session of parliament is even more imaginable. The so-called innovative political party will surely surpass the established political parties and emerge, and the so-called strong cabinet will surely replace the Hirota cabinet and take the stage in the near future. As for the huge budget? Under the conditions of respecting national defense but allowing slight modifications, it can always be passed by some means.</p>
<p>What cannot be managed is that the internal contradictions of Japan have become even stronger than before. - However, as long as colonies can be developed and control in the colonies can be consolidated, these contradictions can also be temporarily alleviated. January 22</p>

<h3>Difficulties in Selecting Army and Navy Ministers Hinder Cabinet Formation</h3>
<p>Divergences in Policy Between Hayashi and the Military Become Apparent; The Issue of Dissolving Parliament Is the Most Troublesome</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The general public believed that after Hayashi Senjuro's meetings with Terauchi and Nagano this morning, the cabinet formation work could proceed smoothly. However, this was not the case. Differences of opinion have emerged between Hayashi and Terauchi and Nagano regarding the selection of new Army and Navy Ministers. For example, for the positions of Army and Navy Ministers, Hayashi intends to appoint Itagaki and Suetsugu respectively, while Terauchi and Nagano respectively recommend Nakamura and Fujita as candidates for the Army and Navy Ministers. Although Hayashi sent messengers to negotiate with Terauchi and Nagano for the second time, Terauchi and Nagano refused to consider it further. Therefore, the cabinet formation work suddenly fell into a deadlock. The underlying cause lies in the divergence of policies, which led to friction between Hayashi and the Army and Navy. The two sides are currently seeking ways to break the deadlock. Hayashi visited the Chief of the Army General Staff, Prince Kan'in, at 5:25 p.m., and then visited Terauchi and Nagano at 5:55 p.m. Currently, dissolving parliament is one of the most troublesome issues. Hayashi believes that this issue should not be decided in advance at this time. It would be more appropriate to re-examine the situation after parliament reopens and then make a decision. This point seems to contradict the Army's opinion. In addition, the Army and Navy have not agreed to other policies. Therefore, whether the Hayashi Senjuro cabinet can succeed has become questionable and is difficult to predict at present. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] As a result of General Hayashi's visit to Army Minister Terauchi this morning, Army Minister Terauchi recommended Lieutenant General Nakamura Kotaro, Director of the Education General Directorate, as the successor Army Minister. However, General Hayashi wants to recommend Lieutenant General Itagaki Seishiro, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, as the Army Minister. Also, after Navy Minister Nagano met with General Hayashi this morning, he went to Kioicho to meet with Chief of Naval General Staff Prince Fushimi to report on General Hayashi's request to consider the matter of the successor Navy Minister, and discussed important matters before resigning. The Navy Minister also visited General Hayashi to convey the Navy's opinion, recommending General Fujita as the successor Navy Minister. However, because General Hayashi hopes that General Suetsugu will take office as Navy Minister, the two sides' intentions are inconsistent. After Navy Minister Nagano returned to his official residence, he held discussions with Vice-Minister Yamamoto, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Toda, and Director of the Personnel Bureau Shimizu. Navy Minister Nagano is rooted in Prince Fushimi's opinion and carefully considers the selection of the Navy Minister. The Navy authorities, in view of the serious situation and the necessity of unification within the ministry, insist on their original position. Therefore, the Navy Minister issue seems difficult to resolve unless General Hayashi concedes. (Allied Press dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] When General Hayashi received the imperial order to form a cabinet, the military expressed satisfaction. Therefore, everyone believed that General Hayashi's cabinet formation work would proceed smoothly. However, when General Hayashi began negotiations with the military on the 31st, the minister selection issue suddenly encountered difficulties, casting a shadow on the prospects of cabinet formation. According to general observations, the reason is that the ministers recommended by the cabinet formation headquarters and the military are inconsistent. However, in reality, there are complex issues such as the reform program and policies that the Hayashi cabinet plans to implement, and the dissolution of parliament, which have led to different opinions between the Army and Navy and General Hayashi. That is, the views of the military and General Hayashi differ not only on personnel issues, but also on policy issues. Therefore, its future is quite noteworthy. (Allied Press dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] From 1:30 p.m. on the 21st, General Hayashi discussed the cabinet formation policy with Shingo Sogawa, Hachiro Ohashi, and Tsuyoshi Kawada at the cabinet formation headquarters. As a result, it was decided to break away from the old pattern and organize a clear new cabinet to rejuvenate the people's hearts. Thus, the cabinet formation work was started. However, that day was limited to internal work, so only Sogawa was appointed as Chief Secretary and Hachiro Ohashi as Director-General of the Legislation Bureau. From the 31st, the surface work began. (Allied News dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Hayashi Senjuro's selection of cabinet members is still under secret negotiations. Although various parties have made various speculations about the successors, none can be regarded as reliable. The trend of Hayashi's actions seems to be still failing to coincide with the Army in some aspects. This gradual approach held by Hayashi shows that Japan will not suffer major changes in the near future. According to general observations here, although parliament is bound to be dissolved, Hayashi will seriously consider this due to the extremely complicated political situation. Therefore, there is still a glimmer of hope for avoiding dissolution before the budget is passed. Hayashi's appointment of Shingo Sogawa as Chief Secretary is extremely noteworthy. Regarding the candidates for Foreign Minister, although rumors are flying around, such as Sato Naotake, Saito Hiroshi, Togo Shigenori, and Nagai Ryutaro succeeding as Foreign Minister, most of them are baseless. The theory that Tatekawa Mutsuyoshi was simultaneously proposed as a candidate for Foreign Minister is even more unexpected. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<h3>Recruiting Talent</h3>
<p>Promoting Continental Policy; Carefully Selecting Minister of Commerce and Industry, and Minister of Finance</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Because the Hayashi cabinet has the mission of reforming administration, the posts of two or three cabinet members may be concurrently held by the Prime Minister Hayashi or other cabinet members. The huge budget for the 12th year of Showa and thereafter, although it has to be re-submitted to parliament due to the resignation of the Hirota cabinet, is almost inevitable due to the serious international situation and the continental policy waiting to be implemented. Therefore, important financial policies such as reforming financial policies, public debt policies, and strengthening controlled economy are becoming more important. At the same time, from a broad international perspective, promoting industry, expanding trade, and planning for national strength are important national policies that the new cabinet should adopt. Therefore, General Hayashi considers the selection of ministers such as Minister of Finance, Minister of Commerce and Industry, and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and must select talents from official circles and business circles with an extremely cautious attitude.

<h3>Satisfactory Results of the League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting</h3>
<p>Representatives Able to Cooperate Harmoniously; Chairman Gu Weijun Expresses Gratification</p>
<p>[Geneva] After the 96th meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council closed, major European newspapers published articles criticizing the importance of the results of this meeting. Today, the Central News Agency reporter visited Dr. Gu Weijun, the chairman of this meeting. According to him, he was extremely gratified by the praise from all sides for his humble election as chairman. He believes that the most noteworthy thing in the meeting is that the representatives of the major member states always discussed everything with a spirit of harmony, mutual understanding, so the result was extremely satisfactory. For example, the dispute between France and Turkey was mediated by the representatives of Switzerland and Russia, and it was resolved satisfactorily. Also, the dispute between Spain and Chile seemed to have reached a deadlock, but it was resolved with the help of his own mediation and that of Aiden Talbott. The meeting had satisfactory results on the Franco-Turkish dispute, the Danzig incident, and the Spanish incident, which was enough to ease the tense situation in Europe a lot. If the same spirit of cooperation can be used to address other important issues in the future, European peace will be consolidated and the risk of European war will be reduced. Our China has always advocated resolving all international issues with peace and justice, and its satisfaction with the achievements of this meeting is no less than that of European and American countries, he said.

<h3>Philippine President Quezon</h3>
<p>[Kobe] Philippine President Quezon passed through Kobe at 8:30 this morning on his way to the United States to attend the U.S.-Philippine trade conference and transferred to a train to Tokyo. Quezon told reporters that his purpose in going to the United States this time was only to conclude a U.S.-Philippine trade treaty, with no other purpose. (Allied Press dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<h3>200,000 People Rally in Moscow's Red Square</h3>
<p>Celebrating the Conviction of the Counter-Revolutionary Case</p>
<p>[Moscow] Yesterday, 200,000 Moscow laborers braved severe cold and strong winds to hold a rally in Red Square, expressing their hatred for the spies, assassins, and lackeys of the fascist intelligence agencies who had just been sentenced by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Khrushchev, Secretary of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party, Shvernik, Secretary of the Central Council of Trade Unions, and Komarov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, gave speeches. The assembly unanimously passed a resolution supporting the main text of the judgment. (TASS dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Today, hundreds of thousands of workers, students, and soldiers, holding flags painted with caricatures of the defendant Radek and slogans condemning the Japanese and German fascist parties, gathered in Red Square to celebrate the conviction of this major treason case. The Soviet people expressed complete satisfaction with the court's verdict. Workers had held several meetings on this issue, passing several resolutions, one of which stated, 'The Supreme Court's verdict is the claim of 170 million citizens of the Soviet Union.' The newspaper commented on the case, saying that the threat of war is increasing, and the spies of Germany and Japan have been forced to prove this point in the interrogation with extremely clear confessions. This contains a great lesson that all Soviet laborers and friends of people's peace must learn from this trial. (Reuters dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<h3>Trotsky</h3>
<p>Claims Confessions Are Completely Fabricated</p>
<p>Mexico City: Trotsky, while receiving visitors here today, denounced the organizers of the Moscow trial. Trotsky said, I am willing to submit thousands of my documents and other letters to an international commission for review in order to clarify the air polluted by deception, slander, and fabricated toxins. This trial cannot be regarded as over. Those who fabricate everything are now just beginning. Although the proceedings of the Moscow trial are very similar to the mental confusion during fever, we will have something to end it with. (Reuters dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<h3>Floods in the United States</h3>
<p>120,000 People Mobilized to Engage in Rescue Work</p>
<p>Chicago: The Mississippi River floods in five states. Today, it seems that the efforts of disaster relief personnel in several states are in vain. Cairo, Illinois, is the confluence of the river and the Ohio River. Its floodgates stretch for 1,200 miles and are worth 100 million yuan, protecting the lives of 500,000 people. Now 120,000 people are doing their best to rescue. Army engineers believe that the floodgates can still control the water, but so far, more than one million disaster victims are homeless, 347 people have died, and property losses are estimated at between 400 million and 500 million yuan. The Red Cross has received donations of 6.4 million yuan, but even if the goal of 10 million yuan is reached, it is feared that it will still be insufficient.

<h3>U.S. Sailors to Resume Work Soon</h3>
<p>Voting to Solicit Opinions</p>
<p>[San Francisco] The strike committee organized by seven West Coast seamen's unions decided today to solicit opinions from members on whether to resume work based on the conditions currently established with the employers. It is scheduled to report next Wednesday. However, the procedures for soliciting opinions are very complicated, and it may not be possible to complete them before Wednesday. Therefore, a spokesperson said that if most of the voters agree to resume work, the workers will probably resume work immediately without waiting for the results to be announced. The voting method will be very simple, only writing whether they agree with the conditions established with the employers. Strike leader Bridges predicted today that most workers will agree to resume work, but because ships that have been moored for a long time cannot sail immediately, transportation will not return to normal until several weeks later.

<p>[Washington] Today is President Roosevelt's fifty-fifth birthday, and more than 15,000 congratulatory telegrams and letters have been received. After dinner, at 11:25, the president made a wireless broadcast speech in his office. Six thousand celebrations were held across the country to celebrate dancing, and the proceeds were used for the Warm Springs Foundation to help child paralysis.

<h3>The New Situation in North China</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>For several weeks, the front line in Suiyuan has been silent. The entire situation in North China also seems quite quiet. Some people may think that the aggressors will really "lay down their butcher knives," but the fact is not that simple. The roots of any drastic change are hidden beneath the calm surface. Judging from the situation in recent days, the worries about the future of North China are really something we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>We believe that the bandit puppet troops invading Suiyuan and their instigators will, after the lessons of past failures, further implement their more meticulous and sinister conspiracies. They are just waiting for the right opportunity to launch a large-scale invasion again. According to reports, on the 23rd, the leaders of the bandit puppets and the personnel of a certain party had an important new resolution on the Suiyuan incident at the Jiabusi Temple meeting. It was rumored that a large-scale invasion of Suidong was scheduled for the 28th. Although it has not been realized, the active westward movement of the bandit puppet troops and the continuous transportation of large quantities of munitions and food from Rehe to the front line are enough to prove that a more serious crisis is imminent.</p>
<p>Looking at the recent situation in Hebei and Chahar, in recent days, Japanese naval and military officials have held repeated meetings and made specific decisions on how to expand the puppet organization in eastern Hebei and how to step up the work of special agencies. The Japanese military in and out of the customs, the puppet Manchukuo, and the puppet eastern Hebei, together with the frustrated politicians and warlords in Tianjin and other places, will secretly hold an enlarged meeting in Tianjin during the Spring Festival to discuss ways to promote the situation in North China. Obviously, what they are planning is nothing more than how to grab North China.</p>
<p>As for the economic aspect, recently, under the beautiful names of "friendship" and "cooperation," "economic cooperation" has been repeatedly promoted. On the 25th, representatives from the North China Garrison Army, the Tianjin Consulate General, the Xingzhong Corporation, and the South Manchuria Railway Company held a North China economic development symposium in Tianjin. Specific plans have been discussed for road construction, mining, water conservancy, cotton planting, etc. However, this is still their public activity in the North China economy. What is even more worrying is the smuggling problem. In recent days, under the support of a certain military department, smuggling in North China has been more rampant than in the spring of last year. Smuggling agencies use a large number of heavy-duty trucks to transport smuggled goods, with armed teams protecting them from behind, which has made the Customs Anti-Smuggling Headquarters helpless. The British Consul in Tianjin has also had to be very concerned. This situation is not limited to North China. It is said that the smuggling trend in various coastal counties in southern Fujian has also become very popular recently. It can be seen that this activity infringing on our country's tax rights is out of a large-scale plan.</p>
<p>In short, the current situation in North China is relaxed on the outside but tense on the inside. We must pay close attention to it at all times and take appropriate and resolute measures to deal with the roots of its crisis as soon as possible. Otherwise, if this situation develops, the sovereignty of our country will inevitably suffer a tragic infringement.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Aircraft Fly to Manchuria</h3>
<p>Departing from Kagamigahara Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The First Flight Squadron Command of the Kagamigahara Army held its first cold-resistant flight this morning after establishing a flight regiment. That is, 24 members of the regiment, under the command of Major General Saga, divided into three vice-plus-type aircraft, and departed from Kagamigahara at 3:30 this morning to fly to the Manchurian side. It is scheduled to return to its original location on February 20. In addition, the Second Flight Regiment also has a joint flight plan between Japan and Manchuria. Colonel Kuriyama is the commander, preparing to use six Type 92 reconnaissance aircraft to fly to Shenyang, and using that place as the center, to conduct cold-resistant flights in various parts of Manchuria. Its total range reaches 7,000 kilometers, scheduled to depart for Manchuria on February 12. (Allied Press dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister's Speech Responding to Hitler's Declaration Calls for International Cooperation</h3>
<p>Maintaining Peace: The Soviet Union Should Not Be Excluded; Treaties Must Be Respected; Disarmament Must Be Achieved</p>
<p>Châteauroux, France – The memorial to the fallen soldiers of the European War in this city was inaugurated today. Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos delivered a speech immediately, explaining the international situation and responding to the declaration made by German leader Hitler yesterday in the German parliament. He said, "Leader Hitler's speech does not contain any attacks on our country. I am very pleased that he said it is inappropriate for France and Germany to have disputes for the sake of human welfare, as our country's aspirations are the same. However, in this world, there are not only France and Germany. Therefore, maintaining peace cannot be done solely by France and Germany. General rules must be adhered to, especially respecting treaties. However, Hitler has recounted his country's repeated unilateral abrogation of treaties and further damaged Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles, which establishes Germany's responsibility for starting the European War. How can other countries increase their trust in the value of his country's signature? Fortunately, there are several positive aspects in Hitler's speech, especially regarding disarmament. Hitler advocates for comprehensive consideration to stabilize the situation and bring countries closer together, but such efforts should not be conditional on opposing any country. I am referring to the Soviet Union, which has 200 million people. Excluding them from the international community is not only arbitrary but also dangerous. Moreover, they have no intention of excluding other countries, and their need for peace is no less than that of others. I believe that the military industries of all countries should be converted to peacetime industries. It is necessary for all countries to take joint action to find a way out for the military industry. In short, we do not ask Germany to do what France cannot do. Regarding the issue of the Spanish civil war, if anyone forces the country to adopt a certain political system, it could cause a major crisis. Only the country itself can decide what political system to adopt. I hope the country can deal with it wisely. The Foreign Minister reiterated that France still considers the League of Nations its home and that the dispute between France and Turkey over the Sanjak of Alexandretta has been successfully resolved after being submitted to the Council of the League of Nations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the League of Nations. Furthermore, we feel that general peace and our country's security have become more solid after closely uniting with other peace-loving countries. The good relations between our country and Britain, and the agreements established with the Little Entente countries and Soviet Russia, are also a strong guarantee for us, which can be used to prevent war. In addition, the democratic foundation of the United States is stable, and we are ideologically integrated with it, which also helps to maintain peace. We firmly believe that war is not inevitable and should do our best to avoid the scourge of war. However, our aspirations for peace have a limit: if our country is attacked by another country, we must rise up to defend ourselves. We must uphold the obligations we have accepted, which we are determined and unyielding in. Our country is free and strong, and has a firm grasp of its own strength and the friendship of other countries. We can shake hands with other countries without hesitation. On this day of the completion of the memorial to the fallen soldiers, we respectfully follow the will of the martyrs and preserve three supreme goals for their descendants: the motherland, peace, and freedom."

<h3>Five German Cabinet Members Receive Highest Party Honors</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Today marks the fourth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule. The cabinet held a meeting in the afternoon, during which Leader Hitler appointed five cabinet members who were not affiliated with the National Socialist Party as party members, namely Foreign Minister Neurath, Economic Minister Schacht, Finance Minister Kroesigk, Transport Minister Rubenthal, and Justice Minister Gürtner. They were awarded the golden party badge, the highest award in the party. The Leader briefly described the great achievements made by the National Socialist Party in the four years since it came to power. Then, Aviation Minister General Göring delivered a speech on behalf of all cabinet members, saying that it was an honor to be the Leader's assistant for four years. Finally, Defense Minister General von Blomberg thanked the Leader on behalf of the army. The cabinet then adjourned. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Forbids Germans from Accepting Nobel Prizes</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Leader Hitler today ordered that Germans be prohibited from accepting Nobel Prizes. This is because the winner of this year's Peace Prize is Carl von Ossietzky, who was previously detained in the Esterwegen concentration camp by the National Socialist Party. It is said that Hitler issued this order as revenge. (National Electric dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<h3>Different Countries Have Different Views on Hitler's Diplomatic Statements</h3>
<p>British and French Disappointment, Roman Approval</p>
<p>[Paris] There are varying comments from different countries regarding the speech made by German leader Hitler in the parliament. A summary is as follows:</p>
<p>Vague and Impractical</p>
<p>London – The impression here of Hitler's speech in parliament is that it only grants leniency to various matters and does not promote anything. The statement that the era of startling events has passed is welcome, but the era of cooperation does not seem to have begun yet. Hitler's tone is generally considered mild, but his response to the points raised by British Foreign Secretary Eden in his recent speech on a general European solution seems somewhat vague. For example, Eden said that it is now necessary to accept all countries as legitimate partners, but Hitler still responded with unchanged hostility towards Bolshevism. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>[London] Major newspapers published on Sunday, namely the Sunday Times and the Sunday Observer, commented on German leader Hitler's speech, and both believed that the various issues raised by British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Premier Blum had not received answers, which is very regrettable. However, it is satisfactory that the door to international negotiations is not closed, and the world's concerns about the European situation can be slightly relieved. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>A Ray of Hope for the Future</p>
<p>Paris – Hitler's speech in parliament was apparently a response to the one made by French Premier Blum in Lyon near London, so it needs careful study. However, France today accepted it with a very mild attitude. According to the French, Hitler's tone was slightly milder than previously announced, which should help clarify the international situation. Although the practical suggestions for adjusting international relations that the French had hoped for were not seen in the speech, the French were pleased that Hitler reiterated that the resentment between France and Germany had been eliminated. Hitler announced that Germany would no longer take startling actions and was prepared to cooperate with Europe. The French considered this the brightest part of the speech. When the Saar region was returned, Germany guaranteed to France that Germany would no longer have territorial desires towards France. Today, Hitler's words are almost a guarantee to all countries that Germany does not want to attack their territorial integrity, such as Germany not invading Memel and not occupying Danzig. It is generally believed that this passage of the speech is a ray of hope for the future. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>[Paris] The initial impression here of Hitler's speech can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The French had hoped that after the speeches by British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Premier Blum, Hitler would give a concrete response. Unexpectedly, this speech was still vague and did not have any concrete conclusions. (2) Hitler mentioned British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech, but avoided responding to Premier Blum's speech made on the 24th of this month in Lyon, which was about economic cooperation between France and Germany. This is somewhat strange. (3) Hitler's wording towards France in the speech was conciliatory, saying that the French government and the French ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, were both loyal. In addition, he provided a guarantee that there are no longer any objects of dispute between France and Germany. All of this made the French feel satisfied. (4) Hitler said that once Germany's equal rights are restored, it will reform the current system of German railways and the Deutsche Bank and place them under the sovereignty of the German government. The true meaning of this statement is still unknown, but it is generally believed that it is a sign that Germany is about to take unilateral action again and declare the abolition of international constraints, as evidenced by the fact that Hitler unilaterally announced the cancellation of Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles, which stated that Germany was responsible for starting the European War. (5) Regarding Hitler's suggestion that Belgium and the Netherlands restore their neutrality before the European War, the general public is paying close attention because this conference will affect the future Locarno Treaty. (6) The sections of Hitler's speech regarding the Soviet Union show that he continues to advocate for excluding the Soviet Union from participating in a general solution to the European situation. (7) Regarding the colonial issue, Hitler said that Germany will not demand colonies from any country that has not seized Germany's colonies. The intention is to indicate that Germany only asks to recover its pre-war colonies and has no intention of coveting Portuguese colonies. (8) Regarding the Spanish issue, Hitler said that Germany only has commercial interests in Spain. Therefore, it is hoped that the international situation caused by the Spanish civil war will not become more serious. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>Consistent with Italian Policy</p>
<p>Rome – Italian political circles fully agree with German leader Hitler's speech, believing that it can consolidate the true peace pursued by Italy and Germany. They also said that the points sought by Hitler in his speech to achieve this peace are completely consistent with Italian policy. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>[Rome] All newspapers expressed satisfaction with the German leader's speech. Gaida, a famous reporter for the Italian Daily, also commented, "After this speech was delivered, various fantasies held by the world have been somewhat eliminated, and governments have a clearer understanding of the reality, which is of great benefit to the overall situation in Europe. As far as Germany's political tendencies are concerned, there are three main motivations: to oppose communism. As such, as long as the mutual assistance treaty between France and Russia exists, the rapprochement between France and Germany cannot be realized. Furthermore, regarding the colonial issue, 'what Leader Hitler said was directed at the two countries that divided Germany's old colonies.'" The Roman People's Daily stated that British Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech on the 19th of this month, mocking Germany, saying that if it could give up cannons, it could get butter. Hitler replied yesterday, "pointing out that this is a fundamental fallacy," meaning that Germany does not want to be isolated, but it also has no intention of disarming. The Messenger stated, "The content of this speech is mild, and the form is fluent. Any agreements that can be based on reality have room to be established in the future." (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>The Shame of the Treaty is Cleared</p>
<p>Berlin – Hitler's speech was published by all newspapers with large headlines, or said "The words signed by the previous government in November 1918 have been revoked by Leader Hitler," or said "The claim that Germany should be responsible for the European War has been solemnly denied by the Leader," or said "Germany's prestige in the world has now been restored." The main point of the newspapers is that Hitler has cleared the shame of the Treaty of Versailles, which is another move to liberate the German nation. The praise for the Leader is even greater than the celebration of the fourth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule yesterday. For example, the local Guidance newspaper stated, "The Treaty of Versailles put shackles on us, which is a stain on history. Leader Hitler has now washed it away. His decisions and the motions he made have been blessed by God and have been successful. God loves the brave." The People's Observer stated, "The parliament was moved by the Leader's great personality and cheered for him. Germany can now cope with world political issues." The German General Report stated, "After this speech was delivered, the door to international negotiations was opened. What is the meaning of the Leader's words? It is that our claim for the revision of the treaty has come to a standstill." The external newspaper, the Berlin Stock Exchange Report, stated, "Our measures regarding the national economy are necessary, but the world doubts them and wants to hinder the revival of our economy. Leader Hitler has therefore faced it with Germany's determination and is determined to continue the four-year economic plan." (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>Belgium Expresses Satisfaction</p>
<p>Brussels – Semi-official figures in Belgium expressed satisfaction with Leader Hitler's statement that he is prepared to guarantee Belgium's neutrality, and said that Germany's declaration to cancel Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (i.e., the article stating that Germany was one of the initiators of the European War) was only made internally and has little impact.</p>
<p>Attempt to Alienate Britain and France</p>
<p>Poland – Polish observers generally believe that Leader Hitler's speech was almost entirely directed at Britain, and he pretended not to hear the speech of the French Premier. This is another attempt to alienate Britain and France, but the positions of Britain and France are in perfect agreement, which is very different from Hitler's position. Therefore, the attempt to alienate Britain and France will be difficult to realize.</p>
<p>No Benefit to the Cause of Peace</p>
<p>Geneva – Observers generally adopted an extremely reserved attitude, and some were disappointed because Hitler's speech did not contain any constructive proposals, but merely rejected certain proposals from other countries, and affirmed or denied some points. It was merely an argument and did not benefit the cause of peace.</p>
<p>The European Situation is Difficult to Clarify</p>
<p>United States – Semi-official figures in the United States had hoped that Hitler's speech would contain reassuring statements, but they were disappointed because the content was vague. They also said that the main point of this speech was internal, and the sections relating to the Treaty of Versailles were not very relevant. However, in terms of colonies, Germany now demands that all pre-war territories be returned, so it is practically impossible for Britain and Germany to reach a compromise. Furthermore, Hitler continued to attack the Soviet Union, so if Europe wants to establish a general agreement that includes the countries of Eastern Europe, the path has been blocked because of this. In short, after Hitler's speech was delivered, some aspects in the United States who advocate that President Roosevelt should participate in European affairs will still feel that it is not easy to start. (Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[Washington] British businessman Sir Simon and President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull recently discussed here the possibility of redistributing colonial raw materials. Therefore, people here today read German leader Hitler's speech in parliament with particular interest. Officials were silent on this, but the international community expressed disappointment, believing that Hitler and French Premier Blum and British Foreign Secretary Eden were clearly unable to coordinate, and there was very little basis for joint cooperation. Hitler's tough attitude on the colonial issue and his lack of concessions on the exchange of views between Britain and France made people sigh. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>The Morbid State of the German Economy</h3>
<p>The Natural Result of Rearmament: An Essay Published in a British Magazine</p>
<p>[London] The February issue of the magazine 'The Banker' contains an essay criticizing Germany's military finance and economic situation in the four years since German leader Hitler came to power. It was published at the time of Hitler's speech in parliament. The magazine said that the morbid state of the German economy is the result of rearmament, and the government's massive waste is far greater than that of other countries, which further exacerbates this morbid state.

<h3>From Verbal Battle to Total Resignation</h3>
<p>— Tokyo Correspondence</p>
<p>㊀</p>
<p>Before the opening of the Japanese Diet, everyone thought there were too many important issues, and some waves were naturally unavoidable. However, in the end, after making some revisions to the tax increase plan and the political expenses other than military expenditures in the budget, the situation could be navigated smoothly. However, the Hirota Cabinet contained too many internal contradictions, and ultimately could not last. It was inevitable that it would resign after the Diet session closed. Who knew that on the first day of the Diet session, the debate between Hamada and Terauchi over whether or not the military had been insulted led to a two-day suspension of the Diet session and then the question of whether or not to dissolve the Diet. Because of disagreement within the cabinet, a huge wave of total cabinet resignation was triggered. This chain of events was by no means accidental, nor was it a matter of personal feelings. It was purely the result of ideological opposition in Japan over the past few years. Two incompatible ideologies have been rubbing against each other too fiercely, and it was natural that they would explode. It can be said to be a social inevitability, but no one expected it to explode so quickly. What are these two ideologies? Simply put, it is the conflict between liberalism and controlled economy. This time, neither the Minseitō nor the Seiyūkai had any plans or determination to overthrow the Hirota Cabinet. Hamada's speech was only to say what he wanted to say, and the wording was originally very careful. He himself never thought it would cause such a big storm. If Terauchi had no dissatisfaction with Hamada's speech, he would not have had the feeling of being insulted. Things in the world are really coincidental. Just the first day, the declarations of the party conventions of the two major political parties did not mention the necessity of strengthening national defense, and at the same time, they all adopted a critical and attacking attitude towards the current cabinet's administration. Therefore, the army first issued a statement saying that the two parties lacked a clear understanding of the current situation and were not sufficient to share the heavy responsibility in times of emergency. If the two parties wanted to oppose the government, please first withdraw the cabinet members from the party. This kind of statement was very important, and all parties attached great importance to it. We felt that the friction between the army and the political parties was bound to expand, but we did not expect that it could immediately cause such a big political upheaval. The army had this dissatisfaction, so Hamada's speech was like lighting the fuse, and it exploded immediately.</p>
<p>㊁</p>
<p>On the day the House of Representatives was in session, the reporter was fortunate to have the opportunity to listen. From Prime Minister Hirota's speech to the verbal battle between Hamada and Terauchi, the whole drama was witnessed. Prime Minister Hirota's speech was like reading a manuscript, which made us feel that he not only lacked self-confidence, but also lacked courage. Compared with Hara Takashi, Katō Takaaki, he was really far behind. Foreign Minister Arita's speech was often ridiculed from the audience. A neutral member, Tabuchi Toyokichi, relying on his seniority, shouted loudly from time to time, 'Don't talk nonsense, hurry down.' Arita said, 'Negotiations between China and Japan have not achieved the expected results,' and the audience laughed. He also said, 'The situation is in a state of stagnation,' and the audience shouted, 'Isn't it a failure?' He then said, 'The negotiations so far, and the future development, have great significance,' and the audience was in an uproar again. Arita spoke about diplomacy with the Soviet Union, and the audience shouted, 'Tragic diplomatic failure.' When he spoke about the increasing friendship in diplomacy with the United States, the audience shouted, 'Don't talk nonsense.' In the end, Arita's speech only had scolding and no applause. This was a phenomenon that had never happened in the speeches of successive ministers of state. Finance Minister Baba's speech listed figures to explain the limits for issuing public bonds, and he did not have any confident conclusions about tax increases and the people's ability to bear the burden. Therefore, there was not a single applause from the audience. Under this situation, the psychology of the members can be imagined. After the speeches of the three ministers, Sakurauchi Yukio, the representative of the Minseitō, first questioned. Sakurauchi's speech was very long. Whenever he encountered an important point, the Minseitō naturally applauded, and the Seiyūkai also applauded from time to time. Hirota, Arita, and Baba's answers were just perfunctory. We who were listening did not feel satisfied, let alone the members. The second questioner was Hamada Kunimatsu, the veteran fighter of the Seiyūkai. Hamada was originally an old Seiyūkai member of Inukai Tsuyoshi, and he joined the Seiyūkai at the same time as Inukai. Hamada's question first criticized the three ministers' answers to Sakurauchi, saying that the answers of ministers of state had never been so insincere. He first attacked the Hirota Cabinet's weakness and its need to rely on the military as a driving force. The verbal attack gradually turned to the point that if soldiers want to talk about politics, they should take off their military uniforms, put down their swords, and form political parties to fight in speech. Hamada then launched a torrent of attacks on the Hirota Cabinet on the point of suppressing speech, and cited the constitution and the Meiji Rescript to expound the true essence of parliamentary politics and party politics, and attacked the rampant bureaucratic politics and dictatorial politics. Whenever he hit the key points, the audience applauded thunderously. The reporter turned to look at the attitude of the cabinet members. Hirota, Terauchi, Arita, and Baba were all busy taking notes on the key points of the questions. In particular, Terauchi's eyes were fixed on Hamada, as if he was very anxious.</p>
<p>㊂</p>
<p>Hamada's hour-and-a-half-long speech was finally over. Hirota first responded, strongly defending himself against the accusation of dictatorial politics, saying that 'the current cabinet decides everything based on public opinion.' The audience laughed. Next was Terauchi, the Minister of the Army and the protagonist of this political change. Terauchi took the podium and first said, 'The Prime Minister has fully explained our country's political form.' The audience roared at the word 'fully'. At this moment, Terauchi still forgot how he should answer below, and hurriedly beckoned to Vice Minister Umezu. Umezu handed him a piece of paper, and he continued to speak. Terauchi said, 'Just now I heard Mr. Hamada's speech, and he said something about the military...' He paused slightly before saying the word 'insult.' As soon as these two words came out, the audience shouted 'No, No' and shouted 'Cancel it quickly.' Terauchi could hardly speak because of the shouts from the audience. He managed to say two more sentences and hurriedly said, 'I won't say more now.' Arita went down and Arita came up to answer, and the attention of the audience was completely shifted to the words 'insult.' No one cared what Arita said. After Arita finished speaking, Hamada took the podium again to question, pointing to Terauchi and asking, 'Just now you said that Hamada's speech contained words that insulted the military, which sentence was the insult?' The audience applauded. 'I am the representative of the people. If you say that I have insulted the national army of honor, even if it means a fight, I will not back down (applause from the audience again). If you say I have insulted, you must cite the facts. I don't understand abstract words.' His aura was overwhelming, and the audience was sweating for him. At this time, Terauchi's face was like a persimmon. He stood up again and replied, 'I didn't say insult, please look at the stenographic record.' The audience was in an uproar. 'I said that the words used by Mr. Hamada gave people the feeling of insult, so I advised Mr. Hamada.' Hamada was a seventy-year-old man, a veteran in the political world, and he would not let go. He took the podium again and retorted, 'I cannot accept the advice of a young man. You are His Majesty's Minister of the Army, but you are a civil servant of the country. Although I am unworthy, I am also His Majesty's civil servant. From the perspective of feudal ideology and bureaucratic self-righteousness, you are an official and I am a commoner, but I am a civil servant with 90 million people as my backing. If I accept your advice, then I must apologize to the world. Japanese samurai have always respected honor and bushido. Can you determine someone's dishonor without any evidence or facts? Please look at the stenographic record. If I have insulted the military, I will commit seppuku to apologize to you. If not, you should commit seppuku to apologize to the world.' While Hamada was speaking, the applause from the audience almost never stopped. Terauchi felt even more embarrassed by the emotional impact. In the end, Terauchi still asked to wait for the stenographic record to be checked before speaking again, and Hamada also reluctantly ended the verbal battle because each member was limited to three questions. Who knew that these few minutes of debate would cause the storm of suspension and the total resignation of the cabinet that night?</p>
<p>㊃</p>
<p>When the House of Representatives adjourned, it was already 6:20. We went home to send telegrams, thinking that we could still see how this comedy would end tomorrow. Who knew that we received the news of the suspension in the middle of the night? It turned out that after the House of Representatives adjourned, Terauchi asked Hirota to convene an emergency cabinet meeting. We naturally did not know how Terauchi argued at the cabinet meeting and how the cabinet members discussed it, but it is said that Terauchi thought that the atmosphere in the Diet today was very dangerous, and the political parties did not feel the importance of the current situation. If they were not prompted to reflect, it might arouse a huge storm. He advocated dissolving the Diet immediately. Some cabinet members thought that this matter was too important and should not be decided lightly. Moreover, the Diet had just opened for one day, and everything had not been discussed yet. Dissolution would be too unreasonable. Therefore, the compromise result was to suspend the meeting for two days first and then discuss it again. The suspension was decided on the 21st. On the afternoon of the 22nd, an emergency cabinet meeting was convened to discuss the measures after the suspension. It was heard that Terauchi still strongly advocated dissolution at that time. If his proposal could not be passed, he would resign alone and hand over his resignation to Hirota in person. Under this situation, in order to avoid the crisis of mutual dissolution of the cabinet, it was only possible to decide on the policy of dissolving the Diet first and then try to remedy it. In fact, when the dissolution policy was decided, some cabinet members already had the intention of compromising, especially Navy Minister Nagano, who hoped that in the first year of the Pacific non-treaty, he could realize the grand plan of enriching and expanding the navy, so he did not approve of dissolving the Diet. Commerce Minister Ogawa, also because he was standing on the position of a member of the Minseitō, had to try his best to prevent dissolution. Therefore, although the cabinet meeting decided on the policy of dissolution, these two suddenly visited Machida, the president of the Minseitō, late at night to state their intention to mediate and compromise. Nagano also visited Suzuki, the president of the Seiyūkai, alone to explain his views in detail. The two major political parties originally had no intention of overthrowing the cabinet. Since Nagano took the lead in mediating, they naturally expressed their agreement, but because of the relationship between the parties, they asked to wait until the next morning to reply. At the same time, of course, there were also the same work going on in all aspects. The work of mediation that night led to a sudden increase in the atmosphere of compromise the next day. On the morning of the 22nd, the two major political parties officially replied that they accepted the mediation. Therefore, the final key was only in the attitude of the army. Here, we should raise several questions. First, did Terauchi agree to the compromise work beforehand? Second, what were the conditions for the compromise? Third, after the compromise, can the friction between the army and the political parties be eased? For the first question, our speculation is negative, because Terauchi's attitude has always been tough, and he has already submitted his resignation letter on the 22nd, so there is no reason to agree. However, some cabinet members thought that if the political parties were willing to compromise, Terauchi might not strongly oppose it, so they tried it out. For the second question, we speculate that the compromise conditions proposed by Nagano were probably that the two major political parties would state that they would not overthrow the current cabinet and guarantee the passage of the budget, then the government would cancel the planned dissolution of the Diet. This observation, although not accurate, is not far off. For the third question, we think that the cabinet members who are engaged in the work of compromise only hope that after the budget is passed, will the friction be eased? Temporarily, I am afraid it is not under consideration.</p>
<p>㊄</p>
<p>On the morning of the 23rd, the eyes of the world were focused on the army. However, the army issued a statement late on the night of the 22nd, rejecting a compromise, and still adhered to its original policy, vowing not to cooperate with the established political parties. Therefore, on the morning of the 23rd, the army convened a meeting of the three chiefs to decide on the attitude of thoroughly rejecting the political parties. The navy also convened a meeting of military councilors to decide to support Nagano's mediation policy. It was really wonderful to be so far apart. Although there were a lot of exchanges between the senior officers of the army and the navy, the most important solo meeting between Nagano and Terauchi could not be realized in the end. Therefore, around 10:00 a.m. on the 23rd, everyone knew that compromise was absolutely hopeless. If compromise could not be achieved, there were only two ways to resolve the situation: total cabinet resignation or dissolution of the Diet. According to political norms, dissolving the Diet is really unreasonable. First, the Diet has no vote of no confidence in the cabinet. The speech of one member cannot determine the attitude of the whole. Second, the current cabinet has no party in the Diet, even if the current cabinet is dissolved, there is no hope of victory. The situation is very obvious, and there is no need to wait for the result of the general election to know. Third, all policy issues have not been discussed yet. On what topic does the government solicit public opinion? With these three reasons, if the work of compromise cannot be achieved, then total cabinet resignation is the most appropriate way. That was how we observed it at first. However, the Hirota Cabinet suddenly decided on the dissolution policy, which made people feel inexplicable. Is there a special technique for the Japanese to use politics? Since Nagano took the initiative to undertake the work of mediation and failed, everyone knows that although there are two solutions, the path of dissolution is impassable. If the cabinet members disagree, there is only total resignation, and the public opinion of the whole country does not recognize dissolution as a solution. In this atmosphere, although Terauchi strongly advocated it, the cabinet members who did not agree could not change their attitude. Hirota also felt that he was powerless, and at this critical moment, it was even more difficult to unify the steps of the cabinet members. Therefore, on the morning of the 23rd, Hirota had already decided to resign. When he convened an emergency cabinet meeting at 1:30 p.m., Hirota met with them individually in advance to avoid conflict among the cabinet members and told them of his decision. Therefore, the most important cabinet meeting only took 20 minutes to decide on the total resignation. There are three reasons for the resignation of the cabinet members, which is unprecedented. Hirota's reason is 'In view of the recent political situation, the administration is even more difficult and it is difficult to expect it to be smooth.' Terauchi's reason is 'I am dissatisfied with the current political situation.' The reason for other cabinet members is to resign because the prime minister resigns. This way of expressing it is very noteworthy.</p>
<p>㊅</p>
<p>Among the political changes this time, there are several things that we can value the most. First, why does the Japanese army reject the established political parties so much? The shortcomings of the established political parties are well known, but under the current constitution, the Diet must be respected, and the operation of the Diet mechanism must rely on political parties. Rejecting the established political parties, how should politics be applied in the future? We know that the army also knows that a strong and effective politics cannot be realized without relying on political parties. However, the established political parties still take liberalism as their guiding spirit, which is fundamentally incompatible with the controlled economy embraced by the army. The so-called controlled economy, although the army denies that it is fascism, this impression is very deep. Therefore, this political change can be said to be the beginning of the direct struggle between liberalism and controlled economy. Second, the political beliefs of the Japanese navy are different from those of the army to a certain extent. The army advocated dissolution, and the navy advocated compromise. This is a very obvious opposition. Whether the claims of the army and the navy in the future politics will always be opposed is worthy of our attention. There seem to be quite a few liberals in the navy. Third, the army and the established political parties have formed an irreconcilable state. Then, how to solve this problem in the future? Organizing a new party is certainly a way out, but such a great undertaking is easier said than done. Even if some people can be absorbed from the established political parties, it is really not easy to get a majority. Forming a party with right-wing groups seems to be of little help. Why? Because the established political parties have been cultivated for decades, and even if there are contacts between them, it is too difficult for the new party to try to invade. Let's see what wonderful plans they have in their bags. (Central News Agency, January 24)</p>

<h3>Shenyuan Basketball Chizhi Barely Wins Xintong Yesterday</h3>
<p>33 to 30, Xintong Played with Four Players in the Second Half</p>
<p>Shenyuan Basketball had a total of three games yesterday. First, the unnamed team of the second division and the Fufeng team played. The unnamed team was very sharp at the beginning and led 20 to 15 in the first half, but it sank slightly later, and the Fufeng team gradually penetrated and reversed the score with 33 to 27. The next game was between Mailin B and Team Seven of the first division and second group. The strength gap was very large. The first half was 18 to 4. The balance was slightly better in the second half, but Mailin still won with 36 to 15. The final game was between Xintong and Chizhi, two teams of the first group, which met for the first time this season due to their different groups. However, Chen Xuechong and Liang Yunming of Chizhi were unable to attend due to leg injuries. Liang came on the court first for one minute because Xu Peisheng was not there, and then went down. After the match, Chizhi first opened the record with one goal each for Ru Lan and Jin. Xintong then exceeded with 6 to 4. Chizhi chased to 9 each. After that, from 12 to 12 to 14 to 14, Xintong led. Zhang Liangxiong of Chizhi once penetrated with 16 to 14, and then Lan Jin chased to 16 each. Xu Gao of Chizhi scored two consecutive goals and led 20 to 18 in the first half. After the break, Kate scored a penalty, and Lan Jin and Gao Nai also scored one goal each, surging as much as eleven points in one go, and exceeded with 27 to 20. Xintong's momentum was awe-inspiring, and Chizhi's luck was very bad, and there were many cases of hitting the basket and then stepping out again. After holding on for a long time, Zhang Liangxiong finally scored two free throws. Xingfusi Tuo was then sent off for four fouls, playing with only four players. Zhang then chased to 24 to 27, but his luck was still bad, and four chances under the basket were lost due to over-operation. After Zhang scored two more goals, Su Yinghai was also sent off for four fouls. Gao Baosheng re-entered and then added five points in a row, exceeding with 33 to 28. However, Zhang Liangxiong was also sent off for four fouls, and Liang Yunming returned with an illness. Fortunately, there was not much time left. After Kate scored a goal, the gong rang loudly, and Chizhi barely won with 33 to 30.</p>

<h3>The Collins Football Team's Visit to China: Shen Silian Discusses Negotiations</h3>
<p>No Formal Invitation, Only Ordinary Pleasantries; Board Meeting to Discuss Upon Receiving Concrete Confirmation</p>
<p>Since Reuters reported that the strong British amateur football team, the Collins team, is scheduled to send twenty first-class players to China for a tour this winter, the reporter specifically visited Mr. Shen Silian, the general secretary of the National Sports Association, yesterday to confirm this news. According to Mr. Shen, during his participation in the World Games in Berlin, he was introduced to Miss Smith, the daughter of the general secretary of the association. However, there was no formal invitation, only ordinary pleasantries. Subsequently, he had a long-distance phone call between Berlin and England with Mr. Smith himself, making ordinary pleasantries, hoping they could form a team to visit China. As for the rumors that there was a promise of a 1,500-pound guarantee, it is not accurate. According to foreign news reports, the association has not yet received a formal notification by letter or telegram from the association. Now, upon receiving concrete news, a board meeting will be convened to decide on all reception arrangements. As for the speculation that Hong Kong may have independently contacted them, according to my observation, it is also not accurate, because in terms of financial and material resources, all specific measures will not be allowed and there is nothing to talk about now.</p>
<h3>"Evening Glow Cup" Table Tennis Finals: Boyang Wins the Championship</h3>
<p>The "Evening Glow Cup" team championship, organized by the Evening Glow Table Tennis Team, held the second finals at Put Yi Society in Datongmen last night (30th).

<p>Boyang wins Aile 3-2</p>
<p>Aile wins Tongle Tongle forfeits</p>
<p>Boyang wins Tongle Tongle forfeits</p>
<p>The battle between Boyang and Aile yesterday was thrilling and full of highlights. In the first group, Depei played against Cai Guancheng. The two were mortal enemies and had met several times in important competitions. Lang took the lead in the first two games. From the third game, a fierce battle ensued, and Cai won. In the last two games, Lang lost due to anxiety and confusion, and Cai reversed the defeat with a score of 3-2. In the second group, Ge Ying also lost to Zhou Runtang despite being in an absolute advantage. Since Boyang had lost two consecutive battles, Yao Guanfan came out in the third group, cautious, and played against Cai Jinhe. Cai Jinhe fought bravely against the strong team in front of him, and fell into a bitter battle, 3-2, Yao Guanfan finally won, and won a city for Boyang. At the beginning of the fourth group, Chen Youda faced Cai Guanwang, and everyone expected Cai to win. After winning the first game, Chen suddenly burst into brilliance, drawing and cutting freely, winning three consecutive games. Chen Youda's contribution to Boyang's victory is undeniable. At the end of the group, Boyang's general Zou Guofan played against Peng Guisheng. Peng knew he was no match and lost in three straight battles. As a result of the competition, Boyang reversed the defeat with a score of 3 to 2. "Boyang and Tongle" and "Aile and Tongle" were judged to be won by Boyang and Aile due to Tongle's abstention.</p>
<p>After the victory or defeat was judged, Mr. Wang Zhongheng, the captain of the Evening Glow Team, awarded the prizes on the spot. The champion Boyang team received a large silver cup of the "Evening Glow Cup" from Yao Guanfan, and the Aile team also received a silver cup of the runner-up. Finally, Ma Tingliang and Zou Guofan were invited to perform. Mr. Ma's Drunken Eight Immortals shot repeatedly made the audience laugh, and dispersed with great interest until the clock struck eleven.</p>
<p>Since Tongle abandoned the game twice, its qualifications were cancelled according to the rules, and the third place was promoted by the fourth Evening Glow Team. The entire competition ended. The results of Boyang vs. Aile are as follows:</p>

<h3>Zhang Jiandong, Jian Tailiang, and Wang Ruifu, Who Organized "Liudong News," Were Expelled and Returned to China, Arriving in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Embassy in Japan is Preparing to Protest; Zhang and Others Plan to Resume Publication in Shanghai or Beijing</p>
<p>Zhang Jiandong, the general manager of "Liudong News," Jian Tailiang, the editor-in-chief, and Wang Ruifu, the editor, who were expelled from the country by the Japanese authorities for organizing Liudong News, arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese mail ship Aso Maru at 1:30 pm yesterday. Students studying in Japan in Shanghai and relatives and friends of the three gentlemen went to the Huishan Wharf to welcome them. They were immediately invited by students studying in Japan to a banquet at Daguanlou on Fuzhou Road. The three gentlemen are currently staying at a friend's place and plan to report to the government in Beijing within days. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency specifically interviewed the three gentlemen yesterday and reported the detailed situation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Motivation for Starting the Publication</p>
<p>We realized that there were seven or eight thousand students studying in Japan and forty or fifty thousand overseas Chinese. Japanese newspapers are controlled by the government and lack truthful reports. In particular, there are many inaccurate records about our country's news. In order to report accurate news about the motherland to overseas Chinese students and introduce the political situation in Japan to the country, and to communicate Chinese and Japanese culture, we raised funds to start the weekly "Liudong News" in Tokyo. It was founded on June 12th of the year before last. The purpose is pure and there is no political connection or party background. At that time, it was approved by various institutions such as the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Chinese Embassy in Japan's Student Supervision Department. Japanese newspapers also unanimously sympathized with and praised it as the only forum for Chinese people studying in Japan. At first, there were few publications on politics and diplomacy. Later, I felt that if political and diplomatic news were ignored, it would be contrary to the significance of starting the publication. Gradually, the records of political and diplomatic news were increased. After the fourth issue, the Japanese authorities immediately took an attitude of intervention. They were often checked and monitored very strictly. Support Until the ninth issue, in order to consolidate the foundation, we formally paid the deposit in accordance with the Japanese publishing law and filed it with the Japanese government. At the same time, we presented it to the Central Propaganda Department of our country for registration and issued a registration certificate.</p>
<p>The Process of Being Arrested</p>
<p>Since then, the Japanese authorities have still been nitpicking, and often warned or confiscated small problems such as words or titles. According to statistics, as of the 59th issue, the number of confiscated issues was more than ten times. In mid-December of last year, we were told by Japanese friends that this time the Japanese parliament was meeting with young soldiers of the Japanese military, intending to exert further pressure to promote its power. The department was particularly dissatisfied with Liudong News. Sure enough, not only were the publications suspended, but the lives of the organizers were also in danger. Therefore, the three of us once returned to China. On the 13th of this month, we returned to Tokyo. At 9:00 the next morning, the Asia Department of the Foreign Affairs Division of the Metropolitan Police Department sent detectives to the news agency to search. All documents were taken away. In addition, Li Zhongping, Lü Kuiwen, and Jian Bocun were also arrested and taken to the Kanda Nishikicho Police Station. Chinese officials and civilians in Tokyo were outraged when they heard the news. On the same day, the Chinese Embassy in Japan sent Secretary Shen Ti, and the Student Supervision Department in Japan sent Chief of General Affairs Section Jiang Junhui to the Metropolitan Police Department to make representations, demanding immediate extradition. Xu Ambassador sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Central Propaganda Department, and Director Chen Cip sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education, reporting separately for instructions. Students studying in Japan also went to the police station to express their condolences and tried to rescue them.</p>
<p>Expelled Back to China</p>
<p>However, various rescues and representations were ultimately ineffective. Repeated interrogations were all forcing them to admit to propaganda against Japan and exposing the secrets of the Japanese military, etc. Because we have a large number of domestic newspapers and magazines, which are displayed in the company for overseas Chinese to read and to instill the domestic situation, this is especially disliked by the Japanese authorities. Once, police officer Watanabe firmly ordered us to point out what kind of publications have what background, and what kind of publications are communist. We told them that all the publications we display have been registered and approved by the government of our country, and there are no reactionary publications. However, he forcibly pointed out that Saturday, Independent Review, Hong Kong Circulation Daily and other kinds of communist publications. Except for Li Zhongping, Lü Kuiwen, and Jian Bocun, who were released on bail by Chief Jiang of the Student Supervision Department in Japan, the three of us were imprisoned for more than ten days until the 15th of this month, when we were sentenced to anti-Japanese communist crimes and ordered to be expelled back to China. We were escorted from Tokyo to Kobe and boarded a ship back to China. Because it was a cargo ship, it had to stop at various ports. After passing through Moji, Osaka and other places along the way, we were taken to the local police station for interrogation, which was delayed until today (that is, yesterday) before we were able to arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Will File a Protest</p>
<p>Although we have suffered a lot, we are not discouraged. After returning to China, we plan to prepare for resuming publication in Shanghai or Beijing, and change it to two large sheets a day. All plans are being discussed. The Chinese Embassy in Japan attaches great importance to the Japanese authorities' unreasonable order to suspend the publication of Liudong News and expel us back to China. It has specially convened a meeting of embassy affairs and is now conducting a special investigation of everything and asking the government for instructions. It is reported that it will formally lodge a protest with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Moreover, overseas Chinese in Japan have recently been repeatedly expelled back to China. Yesterday, there were also three people, Chen Jinxing, a noodle vendor, Xu Xiexing, a worker, and Zeng Yejin, a barber, who arrived in Shanghai on the Aso Maru.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Boy Scout Council Holds a Council Meeting</h3>

<p>The Municipal Boy Scout Council held its first council meeting of the fifth session at the clubhouse at 4 pm yesterday, nominated standing committee members, and scheduled an oath of office, and nominated members to draft the work plan for this year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The council members present were Tong Hangbai, Leng Xueqiao, Luo Lie, Xi Yutong, Yu Kuiyuan, Xia Huanxin, Gong Jingyuan, Shen Fu, Yang Dingcheng, Sun Yixin, Zhao Weizu, Shen Yu, and Xu Guozhi. Tong Hangbai chaired the meeting and Xu Guozhi recorded the minutes.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Volunteer Education Staff's Winter Vacation Training Closed</h3>
<p>Section Chief Jiang Delivered a Training Speech on Behalf of Director Pan; Twenty More Schools Will Be Added in This Short Term</p>
<p>The winter vacation training class for voluntary education staff sponsored by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has been completed for 17 days since it started on the 15th of this month. The closing ceremony was held at the auditorium of the Municipal Shangwen Elementary School at 1:30 pm yesterday. More than 100 people, including Section Chief Jiang and lecturers Li Wanyu, Xue Wei, Qian Fugong, and trainees Ling Hongji, Gu Bingquan, and Yang Ding, attended. After the procedural ceremony, Section Chief Jiang delivered a training speech on behalf of Director Pan, roughly saying that the training class for volunteer education staff in this city will be closed today. Although the training period is short, its significance is quite important. The so-called compulsory education is the obligation that the country should fulfill to make people love the minimum education, and it must force people to go to school, so it is also compulsory education. However, due to the economic environment of China, it can only run short-term elementary schools to educate people for one year. Since the teaching time is short, if you want to improve the teaching effectiveness, you really rely on all the staff who are responsible for the volunteer education work. You should recognize this point and overcome any difficulties, cheer up and do it practically. If you feel that the interest is not suitable, or the work is not good, you would rather not do it, and you must not perfunctorily. I hope everyone will work hard, etc. The ceremony was then completed. According to the statistics, there are a total of 145 graduates in this class. In the last semester, there were 25 short-term elementary schools, 108 short-term elementary school classes, and 29 grades in the two-part system in the city. In this term, in addition to the 29 grades in the two-part system, 20 short-term elementary schools will be added, totaling 45 schools, and the short-term elementary school classes will be reduced to 83 classes. The students will be assigned work within days, etc.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Party Headquarters Will Hold an Excellent Middle School Student Party Ideology Competition</h3>
<p>In Order to Give Them the Opportunity to Publish Essays; Will Start After the Spring Semester Begins</p>

In the past, it has held friendship activities for outstanding students, gathering them several times, and achieved remarkable results. The students have benefited a lot.

<h3>The 15th Anniversary Memorial Ceremony for the Four Boy Scout Martyrs Was Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Five Groups, Including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Presided Over the Ceremony at the Clothing and Hat Tomb of the Four Martyrs in Jiangwan</p>
<p>During the 'January 28' Shanghai War, the members of the 50th Boy Scout Group (Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout) Luo Yunxiang, Ying Wenda, Mao Zhengxiang, and Bao Zhengwu, etc., served in the war zone and died. Yesterday was the fifth anniversary. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Council, the 50th Boy Scout Group, representatives of the families of the four martyrs, the Red Cross Society, etc., specially held an expanded memorial ceremony at 9 am at the clothing and hat tomb of the four martyrs in the Shanghai Public Cemetery in Jiangwan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The representatives who attended included Shen Yu from the China Boy Scout Council, Pang Jingzhou from the Red Cross Society, Xu Guozhi from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Boy Scout War Zone Service Circle, three members from the 213th Boy Scout Group, five members from the 172nd Group, three members from the 176th Group, and representatives of the families of the four martyrs. Qin Huan, Wang Xueran, Li Fei, Zhou Caiying and other people from all walks of life, more than 200 people, were picked up and dropped off by special cars sent by the group.</p>
<p>Ceremony Situation ㊀Gather, ㊁All stand in awe ㊂Sing the party song, ㊃Salute the party flag, national flag, and the portrait of the Premier with the most respect, ㊄Respectfully read the Premier's will ㊅Chairman Ye Chunnian Report ㊆Play mourning music ㊇Salute the portraits of the martyrs with the most respect, ㊈50th Regiment Leader Ye Chunnian, Resident Military Director Wang Yingqi, Reserve Military Director Li Yating, Administrative Department Director Sun Liansheng, Reserve Military Director Cai Tonggui, respectively lay flowers, ㊉Silence for the four martyrs, ㊉㊀Speech, ㊉㊁Sing the Mourning Song for the Four Martyrs, ㊉㊂The ceremony ends and disperses,</p>
<p>▲Chairman's Report After the ceremony, Chairman Ye Chunnian reported that the four martyrs were all professional youths, who joined the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Regiment as members in their spare time. The group's business creed is "to train young people to serve the public". During the January 28 Shanghai War, the group believed that the opportunity to serve the country had arrived. Volunteer members, together with the Red Cross Society, set out to do battlefield rescue work. The brutal enemy, regardless of whether you are a combatant or a non-combatant, kills Chinese people when they see them. Although they are serving to save people, serving the suffering compatriots, and serving the wounded soldiers who resisted the enemy, they were caught by the enemy in the Hongkou District on January 31, and their bodies were destroyed. They must have died heroically and sacrificed for the country. Therefore, the main significance of our commemoration today is about two points. The first point is to stimulate the public and increase the mood of saving the country. The second point is to stimulate our young people, especially the Boy Scouts, to have more and more legacy of knowledge and continue to work hard on the ambitions of the martyrs, etc.</p>

<p>(B) According to a survey by the Financial and Economic Times, the total capital of the existing 74 companies is 591 million yuan. Other small businesses and factories account for about 100 million yuan, bringing the total to no less than 700 million yuan.</p>
<p>(C) In 1935, out of a total of 277,000 looms, 241,000 were wide power looms, 79,900 were narrow power looms, and 55,500 were handlooms. Although the total number of looms has only increased by 12,000 since 1918, the number of wide looms has increased by 112,000. Narrow looms have decreased by 30,000, and handlooms have decreased by 70,000. This substantial change proves that the Japanese weaving industry, in the first sense, has shifted from an old-fashioned production method to a new production process, hence the annual decrease in handlooms. In the second sense, the development pattern has gradually shifted from targeting the domestic market to targeting the world market, hence the doubling of wide looms and the tenfold increase in cotton cloth exports. This also reflects the shrinking domestic cotton cloth market in Japan—due to weak purchasing power among the populace. Otherwise, narrow looms would not have decreased, as Japanese clothing materials are primarily made of narrow fabrics.</p>
<p>In 1934, out of a total industrial production value of 9.4 billion yuan in Japan, textile industrial products reached 1.5 billion yuan, accounting for 15.7% of the total. Out of 2,163,000 workers in all Japanese factories, 562,000 were engaged in the textile industry, accounting for 34.8%. In 1935, out of a total export trade value of 2.48 billion yuan in Japan, textile industrial products reached 590 million yuan, accounting for 23.6%.</p>
<p>Remarks: Production value and export trade value units are in "millions of yuan," and worker units are in "thousands of people."</p>
<p>In 1935, out of a world cotton cloth export volume of 5.88 billion square yards, Japan's exports reached 2.025 billion square yards, accounting for 48% of the total. This seized the cotton industry throne from the British Empire, took away the British Empire's exclusive market, and caused extremely profound Anglo-Japanese economic conflict.</p>
<p>Remarks: Items marked with "×" are estimated figures, with units in "millions of square yards."</p>
<p>The aforementioned three facts, as well as the three tables, prove that the Japanese textile industry firmly occupies the industrial throne in Japan's industrial economy, and also occupies the first throne in Japan's international trade, as well as in international cotton cloth export trade. In 1913—the pre-World War I era—the world cotton cloth market dominated by the British Empire has now been almost completely seized by Japan. Thinking quietly about this, one cannot help but feel a sense of past and present for the British people.</p>
<p>㊁ The Development Process of the Japanese Textile Industry</p>
<p>The Japanese textile industry, in its short history of 69 years, has seized the world cotton industry throne. The speed of its development is truly astonishing. Therefore, what are the reasons for its smooth development process? Why is its development speed so rapid? Naturally, there are backgrounds and reasons for this.</p>
<p>During the Meiji Restoration era, Japanese society, due to its political turmoil and socio-economic unrest, almost followed China's decline and became a semi-colony. At that time, the massive influx of Western goods plunged Japan's inherent domestic industry into an abyss from which it could not recover. Although the Restoration government made determined efforts to prevent foreign goods and vigorously promoted domestic goods, it was not possible to achieve results in a short time. By Meiji 10 (1877), the import value of cotton fabrics reached 89.6 million yuan, accounting for 36% of the total import value. Later, after the suppression of the Southwestern War, political unification gradually progressed, and industrial development also gradually yielded results. In Meiji 11 (1878), 25 districts nationwide were selected as cotton production areas. At the same time, the government invested funds to purchase 4,000 textile machines from England. In Meiji 12 (1879), large amounts of enterprise funds were released to purchase ten sets of 2,000 textile machines. In Meiji 13 and 14 (1880 and 1881), large amounts of funds were loaned out, interest-free for ten years, with repayments in installments. Government loans were provided for private purchases of textile machinery. After these multiple instances of direct assistance, by the end of Meiji 14 (1881), there were 17 textile factories, with 59,000 spindles. In Meiji 19 (1886), tariff protection policies were further implemented. In Meiji 27 (1894), cotton yarn export taxes were abolished. In Meiji 29 (1896), cotton import taxes were lifted. From then on, the foundation of Japan's early textile industry gradually became stable.</p>
<p>In Meiji 27 (1894), the Sino-Japanese War broke out, following Japan's economic development. This war was an epoch-making development for Japanese capitalism. The textile industry, from Meiji 27 to Meiji 31 (1894-1898), saw an increase in textile companies from 45 to 74, textile factories from 45 to 77, spinning spindles from 530,000 to 1,146,000, and cotton yarn production from 291,000 bales to 644,000 bales.</p>
<p>The god of war is the benefactor of Japanese capitalism. After the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War followed, and then the World War. In the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, Japan occupied the Korean and Chinese markets. After the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's cotton cloth imports to Korea and Northeast China reached 3.3 million yuan. After the Russo-Japanese War, they increased to 14 million yuan. In 1914, Japan's cotton yarn imports to China reached an unprecedented record of 570,000 bales. After the outbreak of World War I, Japan took the opportunity to seize the cotton cloth markets in India and the South Seas Islands, which were previously monopolized by Britain. In 1914, Japan's cotton textile export value was 43 million yuan. In 1919, it increased to over 350 million yuan. In just a few years of the European war, the increase rate reached five times.</p>
<p>In 1929, the Great Depression struck the world. Japan again took the opportunity to seize the Northeast and sought to use all its superior conditions to dominate the entire China. It further utilized the depreciation of its exchange rate, the poor labor conditions, and the "rationalization of industry" as powerful weapons to sweep across the world cotton cloth market.</p>
<p>Since Japan implemented an inflationary monetary policy again in 1931, its exchange rate has gradually depreciated, falling to 160% by now. As a result, the cotton cloth export value increased from 198 million yuan in 1932 to 590 million yuan in 1935.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of poor labor conditions in Japan, at the 1933 International Labor Conference, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries raised the issue of "social dumping" in an attempt to improve the living conditions of the Japanese working class and suppress the rapid development of the Japanese textile industry. However, this practical problem cannot be solved by empty international conferences. If we compare the weekly wages earned by workers in various countries, the United States is 35 yuan, the United Kingdom is 18 yuan, Germany is 13 yuan, and Japan is only 5 yuan and 80 sen. As a result, the production costs of goods have the following ratios:</p>
<p>To put it plainly, if the production cost of Japanese cotton yarn is 100 yuan, then it would be 376 yuan in the United States, 238 yuan in the United Kingdom, and 192 yuan in Germany. This is a characteristic of Japan's low labor conditions, and it is also a major factor in the rapid progress of the Japanese textile industry during the global economic depression.</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship between industrial rationalization and the development of the Japanese textile industry, in October 1934, Mr. Kakumura Kozo, managing director of Fuji Spinning Company, gave a speech at the Kyoto Chamber of Commerce and Industry titled "The Superiority of the Japanese Cotton Industry," which was a typical report:</p>
<p>'As a result of rationalization, the production cost of our (Japanese) textile industry is very low. The number of workers has decreased. For 10,000 spindles, in June 1929, there were 61 male workers with an average daily wage of 1 yuan and 60 sen, and 218 female workers with an average daily wage of 1 yuan and 37 sen. By December 1933, the number of male workers had decreased to 27, with a daily wage of 1 yuan and 37 sen, and the number of female workers had decreased to 162, with a daily wage of 77 sen. The production cost, which accounted for half of the original cost of cotton textiles, has been reduced by 55%. This is the weapon of our (Japanese) textile industry's development.'</p>
<p>Remarks: Worker unit is "person," wage unit is "yuan."</p>
<p>In summary, there are five reasons for the rapid development of the Japanese textile industry: ㊀ Government's promotion policies; ㊁ Post-war stimulus and general industrial development; ㊂ Depreciation of the exchange rate; ㊃ Low labor conditions; ㊄ Industrial rationalization.</p>
<p>㊂ The Dependence of the Japanese Textile Industry on International Trade</p>
<p>Although the Japanese textile industry is developing at a high speed, there are many hidden worries about its future. Not only does Japan need to vigorously sell its textile products abroad, but 99% of the raw materials for textile products—cotton—also rely on foreign supply. Therefore, the Japanese textile industry's dependence on international trade is particularly significant.</p>
<p>In 1935, out of Japan's export trade value of 2.48 billion yuan, cotton textile exports reached 590 million yuan, accounting for 23% of the total. Out of the total import trade value of 2.34 billion yuan, cotton imports reached 714 million yuan, accounting for 30% of the total.</p>
<p>Cotton textiles in export trade and cotton in import trade both occupy the most important positions. This certainly proves the particularly significant dependence of the Japanese textile industry on international trade. At the same time, observing the Japanese textile industry itself also reveals a special tendency to rely heavily on external sources. In 1935, out of Japan's total cotton textile production value of 876 million yuan, cotton textile exports reached 590 million yuan, accounting for 68% of the total production value. In 1935, out of Japan's total cotton consumption of 12,520,000 dan, only 167,000 dan were produced domestically in Korea, while 12,353,000 dan were imported from abroad. As a result, the total production value of Japanese cotton textiles was 876 million yuan, while the cotton import value was 714 million yuan. To put it more simply, only 32% of the cotton textile production value is consumed domestically in Japan, while 68% is exported to foreign countries. Only 1.4% of Japan's cotton consumption is produced domestically, while 98.6% is imported from abroad.</p>
<p>Remarks: Cotton textile production and consumption relationship unit is "millions of yuan," cotton consumption and supply relationship unit is "thousands of dan."</p>
<p>I will not discuss the issue of cotton textile production and consumption further here, but will now elaborate on Japan's cotton supply problem.</p>
<p>In 1935, out of Japan's cotton import volume of 12,283,000 dan, worth 714 million yuan, 5,758,000 dan, worth 372 million yuan, were imported from the United States. 5,211,000 dan, worth 259 million yuan, were imported from India. 537,000 dan, worth 42 million yuan, were imported from Egypt. 427,000 dan, worth 20 million yuan, were imported from China. Other cottons, such as African cotton, Nangong cotton, Korean cotton, Brazilian cotton, Peruvian cotton, Turkish cotton, and Persian cotton, accounted for approximately 350,000 dan, worth over 19.5 million yuan. This means that 47% of the cotton used by Japan is supplied by the United States, 43% is supplied by India, and the remainder is supplemented by Chinese and Egyptian cotton.</p>
<p>Remarks: Quantity unit is "dan," and value unit is "thousands of workers."</p>
<p>The Japanese textile industry is controlled by the prosperity and decline of international trade, and Japanese international trade is controlled by the premise of world peace. Once international changes occur, Japanese international trade is the first to be threatened, and the Japanese textile industry will immediately be shaken. Therefore, since the 1929 global economic crisis, the theory of Japanese cotton national policy and market security has been loudly advocated, and it is even more intense today.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, 47% of the cotton used by Japan must be supplied by the United States, 43% must be supplied by India, and the remainder is supplemented by Chinese and Egyptian cotton. However, at this stage, Japan-US relations are very dangerous, Anglo-Japanese conflicts are deepening day by day, and India is rejecting Japanese goods. Japan's intention is to not buy Indian cotton. The future of cotton sources is also very dangerous. Therefore, Japan's dependence on the United States and India for cotton is a major disadvantage in the development of Japanese capitalism. Especially since the September 18th Incident, the military industry has developed rapidly, and cotton is a raw material for manufacturing gunpowder, making its demand even more urgent than that of steel. As a result, the Japanese government and public are loudly advocating the cotton national policy issue.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Britain's control of India and Egypt is because they have large cotton yields, which greatly help Lancashire's cotton production and reduce its dependence on American cotton. In peacetime, it can balance the needs of domestic industries, and in wartime, it can be used as a raw material for military industries. During the European war, Germany used force to seize foreign raw cotton and discovered artificial cotton. To this day, it pays the same close attention to the encouragement of cotton production and the plundering of raw cotton production areas. Italy's seizure of Abyssinia is also because its land and climate are suitable for cotton planting. After Japan occupied Korea, it promoted cotton planting, but its output could only supply 1.4%. After occupying Manchuria, it also implemented a cotton planting plan, but it failed due to climate and geological conditions. China is the third largest cotton producing country in the world, with a climate and soil suitable for cotton planting, and China-Japan's geographical and economic relations are so close and intimate, and the North China provinces are the best cotton producing areas in China. Therefore, in recent years, Japan's cotton planting plan has shifted to North China.</p>
<p>Japan wants to implement a cotton national policy plan and seize cotton supply areas. In peacetime, it can balance the needs of domestic industries, and in wartime, it can be used as a raw material for military supplies. In order to reduce its dependence on American and Indian cotton and the threats from Britain and the United States, it is urgently seeking to seize "North China cotton areas" and create a "Japanese-controlled East India."</p>
<p>㊃ Production Status of North China Cotton</p>
<p>The largest cotton producing country in the world is the United States, followed by India, with China ranking third. If China's cotton can fully utilize its talent and land, then future production increases may surpass the United States and India.</p>
<p>China's cotton production is estimated to be 15 million dan this year, a bumper harvest. According to the statistics report of the China Cotton Industry Association for the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the harvest was 9.8 million dan, and it was 13.4 million dan in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934). According to the statistics of various years, China's cotton production will be between 10 million dan and 15 million dan.</p>
<p>China's cotton producing areas are generally divided into two major cotton regions: the Yellow River basin and the Yangtze River basin. The cotton producing provinces in the Yangtze River basin are Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. The Yellow River basin includes Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi. What we want to discuss now is limited to the Yellow River basin, because of its geographical relationship, it belongs to the so-called North China region.</p>
<p>North China has high terrain and the soil is mostly a mixture of alluvial soil and loess, which is most suitable for planting cotton. The soil along the Yellow River contains the most lime, making it the best area for cultivating American cotton. Because of its excellent natural conditions, the productivity of North China cotton fields cannot be matched by any province in the Yangtze River basin. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu in North China is 30 jin in Hebei, and 26 jin in Shanxi and Shandong, which is 16% more than the national average yield per mu over the years. If converted to hectares, the yield of ginned cotton per mu is over 200 pounds, which cannot be matched by American or Indian cotton.</p>
<p>Because North China has excellent cotton planting conditions, North China cotton has long been the largest agricultural product in the North China provinces, and it also holds an important position in the proportion of cotton production in China. According to the statistics of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), Hebei's cotton production was 1 million dan. It increased to 3.385 million dan in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), and decreased to 2.586 million dan in the 24th year of the Republic (1935). Shandong Province decreased from 2.59 million dan to 1.59 million dan. Shanxi increased from 97,000 dan to 717,000 dan. Henan increased from 719,000 dan to 1.22 million dan. Shaanxi increased from 413,000 dan to 1.198 million dan. The area of cotton cultivated land also increased year by year, especially in Shanxi and Shaanxi. Only Shandong was affected by the Yellow River flooding and could not be cultivated smoothly, so the cotton cultivated area and cotton production decreased year by year, but the overall calculation for North China still increased year by year.</p>
<p>Although the annual production of North China cotton is only 8.8 million dan (in the 23rd year of the Republic, 1934), its future is promising. According to Mr. Li Shubo, a North China inspector of the China Cotton Control Committee, North China cotton production can be doubled within five years, that is, the textile raw materials needed nationwide can reach the level of self-sufficiency. After five years, China's cotton production can be exported and occupy an important position in international trade. As long as the central and provincial governments can seek irrigation methods for farmers in terms of water conservancy, this plan can be easily successful. (See the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, January 9th of the 14th year of the Republic, 1925, for a Beijing communication). According to the survey by Mr. Ohara Minoru in the book "North China Rural Relief and Cotton Industry Improvement" published by the Research Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, if the cotton planting area in Hebei and Shandong provinces is expanded to 43 million mu in 20 years, the cotton production will reach 1.5 billion jin, which has great significance for the Japanese textile industry.</p>
<p>In terms of the quality of North China cotton, it is also above the Yangtze River basin. Nanyuhe cotton in Hebei Province can spin cotton yarn of 16 counts or more. Xihe cotton is elastic and suitable for blending wool and cotton, and it can be used to manufacture gunpowder as a raw material in modern military industry. Northeast cotton has thin and long fibers, making it suitable for spinning medium count yarn. Lingbao cotton in Henan is the best quality cotton in the country, and it can be used as a raw material for 32 counts or more, comparable to American cotton. Shandong cotton is most suitable for weaving, and the annual American seed cotton can replace American cotton. Only Shanxi cotton is of inferior quality. In recent years, cotton inspection bureaus have been established in various places to crack down on bad habits such as small vendors mixing water and impurities, which is of great significance for the future improvement of China's cotton industry. In short, if North China cotton can make use of its excellent natural environment, it will surely become the most beautiful quality cotton in the future. Whether as a textile raw material or as a raw material for military industry and other industries, the value of North China cotton will become increasingly precious in the future.</p>
<p>㊄ Conclusion</p>
<p>Japan is a country that needs cotton. The future of North China cotton is very promising in all aspects, and geographically speaking, it is only separated by a sea, which is a five-to-one ratio in terms of time and freight compared to the long voyage from the United States and India. In terms of international relations, it is more reliable to rely on North China than to rely on the United States and India. Therefore, for the sake of obtaining textile raw materials for the Japanese textile industry and for the sake of obtaining raw materials for manufacturing military supplies for the Japanese military industry, the relationship between North China cotton and Japan is gradually becoming more and more serious.</p>
<p>What kind of plan does Japan use to seize North China cotton? Judging from Japan's consistent policy of attacking North China in recent years, it can be roughly divided into three steps: ㊀ Actively promote cotton planting, improve cotton seeds, and improve quality; ㊁ Increase the number of cotton sales networks so that a large amount of cotton can be concentrated in the hands of the Japanese; ㊂ Directly use military policies and political means to seize cotton producing areas.</p>
<p>The first type, in the first quarter of 1934, Japan began to implement the cotton planting plan in various counties of the North China war zone, deciding to manage 3,000 hectares of cultivated land with a capital of 1 million yuan by the Osaka Industrial Company of Japan. Last year, the company established a cotton planting committee, and also established branches in more than ten counties including Lulong, Fengrun, Zunhua, Qian'an, and Miyun. At the same time, the Shandong Cotton Improvement Association was organized in Shandong, which requested the Shandong Provincial Government to allow it to plant cotton in Zhangdian and more than ten neighboring counties. Another example is the North China cotton improvement and increase planting plan promoted by the recent Xingzhong Company. In short, this only represents Japan's preliminary posture of advancing into North China cotton.</p>
<p>The second type, five of the Tianjin Seven Day Yarn Factory have been completely taken over by the Japanese, and other factories are also under their control. Recently, major Japanese textile companies such as Kanebo and Dai Nippon Boseki are all staring at North China with greedy eyes. Companies such as Tomen, Naigai, Daikang, and Shanghai have already spread out their sales networks in North China, waiting in battle, in order to wipe out everything in one fell swoop. At the same time, they plan to build the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway to seek transportation convenience, and plan to set up cotton exchanges in Tianjin and Qingdao in order to concentrate North China cotton and quickly send it to Japan.</p>
<p>The third type, since the Tanggu Truce Agreement and the North China Incident, to the recent so-called North China problem, using its superior political and military functions, it has tried to plunder North China in one fell swoop. The recent relaxed and tightened slow-moving problem is also a military plan to surround North China.</p>
<p>In short, Japan's plan to plunder the North China cotton area has become more and more serious following the increasing tension in international relations. Can the people being plundered sit idly by and wait for death?</p>
<h3>A Study of the Nanyang Cotton Fabric Market</h3>
<p>— Gao Shiheng</p>
<p>1.  Distribution of the Nanyang Cotton Fabric Market</p>
<p>Nanyang is divided into five major regions: the American-owned Philippines, the Dutch-owned East Indies, the British-owned Malaya, the French-owned Annam, and Siam. Except for Siam, which is an independent country, the others are all colonies of white people, each with its own position and background, using different methods to handle its import trade. The purpose is the same: to serve as the outlet for the industrial products of the mother country. Cotton fabric ranks first in imports in all regions. Except for the Philippines and Siam, which can be freely imported, British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies have restrictions. French Annam uses high tariffs to protect the advantage of genuine French products, and imports from other countries are very few. According to the total Nanyang cotton fabric imports in 1935, converted to national currency, it was 184,633,750 yuan. Japanese goods accounted for the largest proportion, reaching 100 million yuan, while Chinese goods accounted for the smallest proportion, only slightly less than 3 million yuan. According to 1934 statistics, China's imports to Malaya were only 2,053,684 yuan in national currency, while Japan's imports were 5,142,028 yuan. In Siam, China's imports were 30,038 yuan, while Japan's imports were 10,593,652 yuan. Japanese goods win with low prices, and European and American goods are often more than twice as expensive. However, the price of Chinese goods is between the two, so only more expensive Chinese goods can compete with Japanese goods.</p>
<p>2.  The Influence of Overseas Chinese in the Cotton Fabric Industry</p>
<p>The population of Nanyang is 124 million, and overseas Chinese account for 6.5 million. For example, Singapore has a total population of 540,000, and overseas Chinese account for 400,000. Bangkok has a population of 500,000, and overseas Chinese account for more than 300,000. In Saigon, with a population of over 300,000, there are 120,000 overseas Chinese. Everywhere you go, you can see the national flag and overseas Chinese businesses. They occupy a very large influence in the cotton fabric market. Only the importers in the Dutch East Indies are mostly controlled by Europeans. The wholesale and retail trade in other regions are all operated by overseas Chinese. In recent years, because domestic goods have not been promoted in Nanyang, these people have become promoters of Japanese goods. The Japanese not only send representatives to Nanyang to conduct inspections and investigations, but also their industry operates as a whole, backed by the government and the entire domestic industrial and commercial sector. They use the low freight rates of their domestic shipping companies and the low-interest drafts of national banks to compete in Nanyang, and they are invincible. Since overseas Chinese have no domestic goods to operate, and cannot operate European and American goods, they can only focus on Japanese goods. In a few years, domestic cotton fabrics will inevitably be on the verge of extinction in Nanyang, which is beyond doubt. It is hoped that the domestic cotton textile industry will rise up and catch up quickly to reverse this decline.</p>
<p>3.  American-owned Philippines</p>
<p>The Philippine Islands have a population of 13 million, most of whom are farmers, with a prosperous and clean life. The import of cotton fabric ranks first among imports. From 1917 to 1922, the average annual import of cotton fabric was more than 44 million Philippine pesos. In 1929, it reached 54 million. In 1933, it was hit by the global depression and fell to 26 million. In the past two years, it has gradually recovered and is now over 32 million Philippine pesos. The United States, as the suzerain state, has the most favorable treatment of duty-free imports, but in fact American goods cannot compete with Japanese goods. As shown in the first table, in 1931, American goods imported more than 16 million, while Japan only imported 10 million. However, by 1935, Japan had advanced and was on par with the United States, both at 13 million. According to recent observations, Japan will surpass the United States in the final statistics for 1936. We can further analyze the trend of the market from the import quantity in the second table. In 1935, American goods were imported at a cost of more than 13 million, importing more than 35 million square meters. Japanese goods were imported at the same cost, importing 72 million square meters. The value of one yard of American goods can be exchanged for two yards of Japanese goods. It is inevitable that American goods will be eliminated and Japanese goods will rise. The import of Chinese goods to the Philippines accounts for a very small proportion in both quantity and value. Most of them are 12-pound and 16-pound coarse cloths. Moreover, except for a few shipments from Wing On and Shenxin, most of them are still exported by Japanese spinning mills, which cannot be said to be Chinese goods.</p>
<p>4.  Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies is the largest market in Nanyang, with a population of 60 million and strong purchasing power. Before the European War, 19/20 of cotton fabric imports came from the Netherlands. During the war, Japanese goods took the opportunity to enter the market and became increasingly active. The Dutch East Indies government promulgated restrictions on imports on February 20, 1934 to protect the import of Dutch goods. This restriction is based on the import quantity from 1929 to 1933 as the standard. For example, 5 million yards of dyed twill fabric within 26 inches can be imported each year, of which 2 million yards must be imported from the Netherlands, 1 million yards must be imported from the United Kingdom, and the other million yards can be imported from other countries. Japanese goods are favored by importers in the Dutch East Indies because of their low prices. If it were not for government restrictions, Dutch and British goods would have no room for survival. The allowable quantity of Chinese cotton fabric imports is included in other countries and is the only strong competitor to Japanese goods. According to the statistical figures in the third table, it can be seen that in 1935, cotton fabric imported from Japan accounted for 84% of the total Dutch East Indies, imports from the Netherlands accounted for only 12%, and imports from China accounted for only 0.47%. The types of cotton fabric imported into the Dutch East Indies are mainly bleached cloth, followed by dyed cloth, and then gray cloth. Japanese goods are imported quite evenly. Except for gray cloth and printed cloth, Chinese goods are insignificant, which is shameful.</p>

<p>The Situation Suddenly Becomes Clear and the Bond Market Soars</p>
<p>—February Futures Jumped Two Yuan—</p>
<p>The bond market last week was a period of alternating between January and March futures. The market situation suddenly changed drastically. This was because the situation changed from chaos to clarity. People's hearts were extremely upright. The prosperity of buying on the surface was rare. Those who went long against the short were even more enthusiastic. With the market price in a state of sharpness, it suddenly turned into a soaring situation. The Class C and B bonds of the January period all frequently hit new highs. The ex-dividend market of the February and March periods also rose step by step. The firmness of the market showed no sign of fatigue. However, because the Spring Festival holiday started from the 6th, there were only five trading days in the bond market this week, so it is expected that there will be no major changes. The process of the whole week: Monday was the last day of the January period. Because major players were striving to buy, the market suddenly rose sharply. Class A and others all rose sharply by two or three corners to one yuan and one corner. Only February futures were traded on Saturday. There was still a surplus for short sellers to roll over, and the trend showed a slight decline in silence. March futures began to be traded on Wednesday. Major players such as No. 16, 77, and 11 all vigorously purchased, and the market price slowly rose by about half a yuan. The market was closed on Thursday due to the handling of the January period settlement. On Friday, the Shaanxi situation suddenly became clear, and people's hearts became more and more boiling. The buying market became more and more enthusiastic. Unified bonds all rose sharply by four corners and a half and seven or eight corners to one yuan and three corners. On Saturday, because some bulls gradually sold off, the market price turned to a decline. However, major players still bought more, and the trend was still very firm. The result of the whole week was that the January period rose by two or three corners to one yuan and one corner. The February period soared by two yuan and six corners to two yuan and five points. The total number of transactions for the newly opened March period was 41,805,000 yuan. The comparison of its rise and fall is listed on the left (unit completion transaction unit hundred yuan)</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Estimated Production of New Chao Sugar This Season</p>
<p>Approximately 750,000 bags, a decrease of slightly less than 15% compared to the previous season. Domestic green and red sugar has always been crowned by Chaozhou goods. According to a letter from You Tou yesterday, the total number of new Chao sugar this season is approximately 750,000 bags, a decrease of slightly less than 15% compared to the previous season. It is heard that the Yangyang Factory still needs to collect raw materials and convert them to Five Sheep White Sugar. If so, the green and red sugar may need to be reduced further, which is also expected. Furthermore, since the registration of new sugar, a total of more than 150,000 bags have been exported. There are still more than 40,000 bags in You Tou, and about 500,000 bags in various production areas in Chaozhou. The daily transport to You Tou is about 2,000 to 3,000 bags of green sugar and more than 1,000 bags of red sugar, so the market is relatively stable. Recently, various gangs have been collecting goods, and most cargo owners are unwilling to sell immediately at the market price, so it has recovered after fatigue.</p>

<h3>Struggle</h3>
<p>— (Xiaoting)</p>
<p>Don't think that the end of the struggle is success, sometimes there are fortresses of failure waiting for you ahead.</p>
<p>The failure of struggle is the experience of the life process, and the success of struggle is the achievement of suffering in life.</p>
<p>The cowardly have no ambition to struggle, the mediocre have no strength to struggle. The fools who struggle are smart and brave people. Only smart and brave people know the value of struggle.</p>
<p>The more people are squeezed by the environment, the faster the road of struggle runs. The more people fail in affairs, the more confident they are in their struggle.</p>
<p>A country without a fighting spirit will perish, and a person without a fighting spirit will fail.</p>
<p>Places of feasting and dancing are the lairs of eroding struggle, and places of extravagant indulgence are the deep pits of sinking struggle.</p>
<p>The reality of struggle is to endure hardship and work hard. People who are accustomed to enjoying themselves cannot talk about being able to struggle and jump in the circle of struggle.</p>
<h3>Reed Catkin Shoes in Pudong</h3>
<p>— Jiang Junqing</p>
<p>The biting north wind roars, and it is again the time when reed catkin shoes are popular in the rural areas of Pudong: - they are a wonderful product for the poor to keep out the cold, made of reed catkins and rice straw; high tops, thick soles: buy them, trim the edges with cloth, and line them with cotton wool inside. When worn on the feet, they are warm and comfortable, better than cotton shoes. The selling price is only one corner and two or three cents per pair, which is both economical and durable.</p>
<p>Moreover, wearing these reed catkin shoes allows air to flow smoothly without hindrance, unlike cotton shoes that wrap tightly and are airtight. People with athlete's foot are especially suitable for wearing them.</p>
<p>It is said that fast hand-makers can weave five or six pairs a day, or at least three or four pairs. If each pair is counted at one corner and two cents, weaving four pairs of shoes a day can maintain the livelihood of a family of four or five people! Therefore, the hardworking rural women of Pudong regard this as the only easy and profitable sideline business in winter!</p>
<h3>Crows in Xi'an</h3>
<p>— Guang Ji</p>
<p>Since the Xi'an Incident on December 12 last year, this ancient capital city of Xi'an has become the focus of attention around the world. Now that General Chiang has escaped danger, the situation in Xi'an is still chaotic! This is naturally a matter of deep concern to the whole country.</p>
<p>Because of the political situation in Xi'an, I also thought of the most famous crows in Xi'an. Anyone who has been to Xi'an knows that there are more crows in Xi'an than anywhere else. When the red sun first rises, groups of crows fly out of dilapidated walls and temples, or ancient palaces, like a swarm of bees, with dark clouds dotted, forming a spectacular sight. Sometimes they form teams and fly to the nearby fields to find food; sometimes they land on the guard's head to find food. If you are walking on the street, they will walk in front of you, less than two or three feet away, and they will not be afraid at all. It is said that the beans in the grocery stores and the fish on the stalls: even the meat carried by the workers, if they are not careful, may be snatched away at any time. When the red sun sets and the twilight is vast, then far and near, they form groups and fly into the dilapidated temples and ancient palaces, fighting for lodging. The Qingzhen Pavilion in Xi'an is their main camp. For a while, flying, chirping, and deafening. If the foreign city of Venice can be regarded as a 'city of pigeons', then our Xi'an can also be named 'city of crows'.</p>
<p>But why are so many crows not caught? That is also for a reason, because the year when the crows come more, that year is bound to be a good harvest; if it is a famine year, then the crows will fly to other places. Therefore, the people of Xi'an believe that the arrival of crows is very auspicious, just like we southeastern people treat swallows, letting them build nests in the house, only loving them and having no time for anything else.</p>
<p>Now the Xi'an Incident has been basically resolved! We earnestly hope that the Shaanxi military authorities will quickly pull back from the brink of the precipice, so as not to have to take military action to quell the rebellion, turning Xi'an into a piece of gravel soil. In the future, when dusk comes, the crows will not be able to sing in the setting sun!</p>
<h3>Boat Girls of Ap Lei Chau, Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiaokan</p>
<p>Boat girls exist everywhere. West Lake in Hangzhou and South Lake in Jiaxing are both places where boat girls are produced. But how can those places compare to the boat girls of Ap Lei Chau in Hong Kong?</p>
<p>Ap Lei Chau in Hong Kong is an island facing Hong Kong across the sea. The surrounding area is probably more than five li, and it can also be said to be a village. - Nine out of ten of the residents on the island live by catching fish. Living in this peaceful island country, they also have beautiful fragrant flowers to play with; they also have the chirping of birds to listen to, how comfortable and happy! That virgin-like charming: quiet beauty is really a secluded paradise, full of the intoxicating mood of 'Penglai Island scenery'.</p>
<p>The daughters of the fishermen all have the beauty of falling fish and sinking geese; with lively and fluent eloquence, they have to find a sideline business that is relatively easy to make money to supplement their family. But in this day and age, what stable career is left for the girls to do? They have no other way. In order to satisfy the desires of life, they have to brazenly engage in the business of 'boat girls'.</p>
<p>In the evening when the moon is bright and the breeze is clear, if you are in a good mood, go to the green grassland-like beach for a walk, and those boat girls dressed in gorgeous clothes will shout at you: 'Do you want to take a boat!' 'Do you want to stay overnight!' That voice, that mysterious and seductive voice, is as crisp and beautiful as a delicate oriole coming out of the valley; as moving and soul-stirring as a swallow skimming flowers! No matter how iron-willed you are, you will not be afraid to cross the boat and enter non-fantasy.</p>
<p>Once in the boat, you can talk to her about the boat price. Generally, everything is included in one night for only two or three yuan. The boat girl supports the oar; while also singing seductive ditties. The cool sea breeze blows in gusts, blowing away the fatigue of your whole body; blowing away the troubles in your heart!</p>
<p>In a flat boat, swaying in the heart of the sea as smooth as a mirror, embracing a beautiful woman with jade skin and jade bones like a fairy, who can not be restless and do romantic and elegant things! - Ah! The boat girls of Ap Lei Chau; the black night of Ap Lei Chau</p>
<h3>Near Yokohama Bridge</h3>
<p>— Zhibu</p>
<p>Yokohama Bridge, this place name, must leave a very terrifying impression in your mind; this impression is probably the January 28th Incident of the past - the sound of gunfire seems to still exist, and the terrifying atmosphere is still shrouded.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I happened to walk past here. The stench of river mud was very uncomfortable. The river water was not very deep. I only saw a few fishermen. They seemed unable to express their suffering. They were working hard despite the cold to make a living and to eat. At that time, I stared blankly, and I couldn't help but feel touched;</p>
<p>"Are you cold?"</p>
<p>"How many fish have you caught?"</p>
<p>When I asked these two questions, it touched his mind even more. He looked at me and said nothing. This is no wonder. Alas! He can be regarded as a person outside the circle of happiness.</p>
<p>There are no big shops here, so what is it? Is it a flat house? No! On one side is a deserted meadow, and on the other side are several shops of friendly countries. 'Comrades' is the first one under the bridge. This name is quite interesting. In various places in our country, I dare to believe that I have not been to, because I can't find it, so I want to talk about it; the meaning of this name, in my careful thought, is probably when the soldiers stationed in our country meet, everyone goes to eat a little bit, so it is called "Comrades Canteen."</p>
<p>In addition to this canteen, there are also ×× dance halls, stationery stores, schools, hospitals, and barbershops, all run by people from friendly countries; but, what do we have here? There are drug stores, pawn shops, and a few small shops for exchanging silver coins, and nothing else can be named; the very famous Shenjianglou Restaurant in those years has long closed its doors. Then, if you have not been there, seeing my words above, you can imagine the situation of this place.</p>
<p>However, I hope that this place will not always be deserted. Don't we do business? Don't we serve as officials? Why? Why? Because... Is there a devil in this place? Of course we won't believe it, and even if there is, we won't be afraid.</p>
<h3>Puyi's Four Years of Puppet Life</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>Since the 'September 18th Incident', Puyi was coerced into becoming the puppet emperor of 'Manchukuo'. Puyi's life in the past few years can be said to be very pitiful. Tourists from all countries who have been to the Northeast know that Puyi is the loneliest emperor in the world. In this world, other emperors live in marble palaces surrounded by courtiers, but Puyi, after losing the throne of Beiping in the Xinhai Revolution and after the 'September 18th Incident', wanted to relive the old dream of being an emperor, but now the place where he lives is an old house of the Tingwu Department. This house does not look like a palace, but more like a barn.</p>
<p>Since Puyi ascended the throne in Changchun, until now, in four years, he has only left Changchun three times: once to Shenyang to pay homage to the mausoleum and worship ancestors, once to Harbin to inspect the 'Manzhou Corps' of the army and navy, and the last time to Japan to meet the Japanese emperor. He is thirty-four years old this year, and his life is completely trapped in that broken house of the old Supervisory Department built with gray bricks and tiles, surrounded by barbed wire fences, and it is electrified. Each corner is surrounded by high walls to form a bunker, and guards are stationed to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Usually, he not only lives in seclusion, but also refuses to easily meet with foreign guests who visit him. He once ruled over 450 million people in China, but now he is a puppet emperor in five small houses, which really makes him feel nostalgic for the past! His wife is thirty-one years old this year and lives with him. In addition, there are several veterans of the Qing Dynasty who follow him. Guests who walk into the old house of the Supervisory Department can only pay attention to a dragon chair made in Japan.</p>
<p>Puyi only takes tennis as a pastime in terms of sports, and sometimes listens to wireless radio. If he has more free time, he reads books. He loves to read the classics written by Confucius. In terms of life, all his habits are the same as those of the Chinese people. Puyi only has one wife. It is said that this wife is his original match. He originally had a concubine, but she announced her separation not long ago. In short, his puppet life can be said to be very pitiful!</p>
<h3>Replacing the Phoenix in Its Nest</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode 10 (Su Pa Sends Entangled Silk, Strange Interweaving; Yellow Flowers Face Wan Autumn, Letters Add Sorrow)</p>
<p>Menglan had this idea in her heart. When she went home from school, her face inevitably showed a kind of melancholy. She carried her schoolbag under her arm and her feet seemed to weigh dozens of pounds. She moved only a few inches at a time and slowly walked towards the back building. All parents are mindful of their children every step of the way. Menglan's situation was first seen by Mrs. Jiang after she entered the house. After he went upstairs, Xiaoju immediately followed him into the room, and asked with a smile: Miss, are you feeling unwell? Menglan put the schoolbag on the bookshelf and took out another book to read. After taking out a book, she weighed it twice in her hand, looking thoughtful, and then put it back on the bookshelf. She unfolded her schoolbag, took out a English book and put it on the table, but then muttered to herself: How can I have the heart to study. So she put the book back in her schoolbag and stared blankly at the shiny surface of the desk. Xiaoju asked him if she was sick, but she didn't answer, so she didn't dare to ask again. So she quietly stood aside with her hands hanging down, glancing at him from time to time. Menglan couldn't see any meaning in the shiny desk surface. So she raised her eyelids and looked out the window. The first thing that came into her eyes was of course the three tall willow trees. So she crossed her arms and leaned against the table, and looked at the three willow trees again. She thought of the several poems that Guoqi had sent, which said, "I would like to be a green-feathered bird, nesting in your window's willow, forgetting the peach and plum's dislike, peeping at your door all day long." These words of deep affection made people feel lingering and touching. According to what he said in his letter, he had once walked alone under these willow trees on a moonlit night, staring blankly at the windows upstairs for several hours, until the dew filled his clothes and he felt too cold to bear, before slowly going home. Judging from this incident alone, his poem about wanting to be a green-feathered bird was not a lie written casually, but a real thought for this infatuation. It had been two months since she had seen him. Presumably, his infatuation had developed into a heart disease, and this heart disease had developed into this melancholy look. If you want to relieve his melancholy look, the only way to cure the disease is to relieve his heart disease. If you follow his wish, he will be happy. But it is absolutely impossible to do so in one's own family and life. As she was thinking this way, she saw the decaying willow branches and leaves constantly swaying in mid-air, which could just express the melancholy meaning in the eyes of a sad person. (129)</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Civic Training</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>The second round of civic training has finally arrived, and those who received the notification slips had no choice but to gather in front of the district office to listen to the instructions. The instructor was Mr. Cheng, the former director of the People's Education Center, and the assistant instructor was Qin Azhong, a model citizen of the village. On a drizzly afternoon, many villagers wearing tattered clothes and tied with tattered dark blue aprons, who were usually so isolated that you could catch ghosts, walked one after another to the large parade ground that was usually deserted. They all shrank their heads, raised their eyebrows, and waved their sleeves, standing one by one against the wall, motionless like wooden stakes. However, each person's face was filled with a kind of unwillingness and fear.</p>
<p>The lawn was quiet and silent. Although the citizens waiting for training would sometimes whisper to each other, or a few young and lively lads would inevitably tell a few jokes, the voices were so low that no one dared to speak loudly. Only the blue sky, white sun, and red earth flag at the top of the flagpole at the corner of the field was flapping in the wind. Opposite, a new notice was suddenly added to the public reading board. This was probably for the start of the second round of civic training!</p>
<p>First, the deputy instructor pinned a triangular symbol on the chest of each citizen and lined them up according to height. He showed them a few 'stand at attention' and 'at ease' postures and then explained various forms and methods to them. However, the villagers were completely ignorant, so no matter how hard he tried to explain, they still had no idea.</p>
<p>Instructor Cheng walked out of the district office. He glanced at me and walked over to greet me. I said:</p>
<p>"It's really not easy to teach them. You must be very tired!" He smiled at me and didn't reply. He walked across the parade ground on his own, while the citizens were being instructed by Deputy Instructor Qin. Instructor Cheng saluted.</p>
<p>He said something to Qin Azhong that we didn't hear clearly. Then he spun around a few times in the middle of the field, the leather riding whip in his hand whistling slightly, looking quite heroic and dignified.</p>
<p>The citizens had not yet received their uniforms, and Deputy Instructor Qin was only wearing a gray cloth military uniform, but Instructor Cheng's brand-new yellow-green woolen military uniform looked very good. On his hat was pinned a blue sky and white sun, and on the two hard collar tabs, red base, a gold line was drawn, and on each side of the line were three triangular objects, shining brightly in people's eyes.</p>
<p>'Stand at attention... At ease...' Deputy Instructor Qin took two steps back, made a standing at attention posture himself, and then stretched his right foot outward and shouted straightly. Then the citizens followed his example. After shouting 'at ease', Deputy Instructor Qin then taught them how to 'dress to the right', how to 'look forward', how to 'count off', and how to 'call the roll'. After the roll call, Instructor Cheng tucked a leather riding whip under his arm, then took out a Parker fountain pen and opened the roster to call the roll. After the roll call, it was time for lectures again. However, because Instructor Cheng was from Suzhou, he spoke pure Suzhou dialect, which sounded like a Suzhou opera performance on stage, very clear and pleasant.</p>
<p>The rain gradually became denser, and it was mixed with flakes of snow, as beautiful as a crystal curtain decorated with plum blossoms. At the same time, Instructor Cheng, Deputy Instructor Qin, and the citizens' clothes and hats were covered with a layer of white snow, so Instructor Cheng dismissed them hastily.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Various Charitable Organizations Form Committee to Help American Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Deliberations held yesterday at the Confucius Mansion; established at the Central Bank this afternoon</p>
<p>The Shin Shi News Agency reports: This time, the United States has suffered a devastating flood, affecting a wide area, and countless lives have been lost. According to reports in various newspapers and telegrams, at the time of the severe winter, the affected victims are in dire need of relief. After hearing the news, our country's government and the public, based on the human obligation of mutual assistance and mutual aid, generally believe that disaster relief and helping neighbors is something that should be done between friendly nations. Just as during the past Yangtze River floods in our country, American people also generously donated to help with relief. Therefore, various charitable organizations in Shanghai, such as the Red Cross Society, the Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association, and the Children's Welfare Association, etc., jointly requested Mr. Zha Xiangxi, chairman of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, to convene people from all walks of life to discuss ways to help with the American disaster relief. Yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock, a meeting was held at the Confucius Mansion on West Aihongsi Road. Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Wang Zhengting, Zhao Jinxiang, Zeng Rongfu, Zou Lin and other persons in charge of the Joint Disaster Relief Association of Charitable Organizations, the Red Cross Society, and the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, etc., were present. It was decided that at noon today, at the Central Bank, the Joint Disaster Relief Association of Charitable Organizations would be responsible for convening representatives from various charitable organizations such as the Red Cross Society, the Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association, and the Chinese Children's Welfare Association to organize a disaster relief committee, hold an establishment meeting, and begin fundraising efforts. The detailed rules for fundraising, etc., will also be decided at the same time. It is reported that Chairman Jiang and his wife, who are now in Fenghua, are also very concerned about this American disaster. They telegraphed Shanghai to express their sympathy for the fundraising efforts of all sectors.</p>

<h3>Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications Stabilizing Subsidiary Currency Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Copper coins received will be exchanged at the legal price; the Central Mint is working day and night to mint subsidiary currency</p>
<p>Recently, the price of copper coins in Shanghai has soared. The exchange rate at various cigarette and exchange shops is more than 280 copper coins per national currency yuan, which is more than ten coins different from the Ministry's fixed standard of 300 coins. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has strictly ordered the money industry and currency exchange industry associations to find ways to crack down on this. As for the subsidiary currency market prices announced daily by the money industry market, although they are handled in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, the black market prices are still high. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Finance has sent a letter to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, ordering them to find ways to stabilize prices and ordering the Central Mint to rush to mint subsidiary currency to meet the needs of the market. Now, in addition to the Central Mint working day and night to rush to mint currency, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications believe that when necessary, they will exchange the subsidiary currency previously received at the legal price in order to stabilize the price of subsidiary currency. However, because the end of the lunar year is approaching, the soaring price of subsidiary currency is a phenomenon that occurs every year. It is expected that after the end of the lunar year, it will return to its original state.</p>
<p>The Currency Exchange Industry Association yesterday asked the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request the Central Bank to maintain the uniformity and stability of the currency system and the balance of supply and demand. The document stated: "We hereby submit a request to ask the Central Bank to collect as much subsidiary currency as possible and set up more exchange offices to balance supply and demand and benefit the people's livelihood. Since the currency system reform, the legal price of old subsidiary currency has been convenient for all people and benefited the whole country. The government has been determined to unify the currency policy and has actively destroyed old copper coins and sent them to the mint for melting. Now they are becoming increasingly scarce. However, new copper coins are difficult to exchange due to the sharp increase in demand, and the market is not circulating enough. Demand exceeds supply, resulting in a money shortage everywhere. The exchange rate of new copper coins is actually mixed with the old steel yuan, with only 2,900 wen (that is, 97 coins) exchanged per yuan. Although the Central Bank exchanges them, it is limited to its own bank. Thousands of people go to exchange them every day, but there is only one exchange window and only three hours a day. Each person is limited to exchanging ten yuan, and the crowded situation is unbearable. Therefore, there are often those who wait all day and return in disappointment. Shops have few employees, and time is money. Exchanging money is so difficult that they all regard it as a daunting task. Other factories and warehouses issue wages and need to issue several hundred yuan. If one person is limited to exchanging ten copper coins, how can this be done? They seek other ways, and the price is high and low, disrupting the currency system. Furthermore, the difficulty with changing nickel subsidiary currency and corner notes to the legal currency at central banks for shops that have a large income, like game parlors or separate shops, is similar to exchanging copper currency. Those who cannot wait end up selling on the market at a discounted price. If this continues, the unified new subsidiary currency will be in danger of following the same path as the old copper coins and destroying the decimal currency. The association believes that this matter is related to currency policy and hinders people's livelihood. It believes that in order to maintain the uniformity of the currency system, the Central Bank must improve procedures, facilitate citizens, and set up more exchange offices or entrust other banks to collect and exchange as much as possible in various districts. It is not enough to correct this monetary damage. Therefore, it is recommended to your association to request the Central Bank to adopt and implement it. This will be convenient for the public. Sincerely presented to the Shanghai Senior Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>National Hospital to Begin Construction Soon</h3>
<p>Zhang Xijun stationed in Shanghai to negotiate; Shanghai medical community raises 100,000</p>
<p>Central Committee member Jiao Yitang, who is also the head of the Central National Medical Center, advocated the improvement of inherent medicine and drugs. In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine has been popular overseas, and eight overseas branches have been established. Jiao Yitang deserves most of the credit for the development of traditional Chinese medicine overseas. Previously, Jiao Yitang, seeing that practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine each focused on their own unique experiences and techniques, did not organize a hospital in order to concentrate research and promote innovation. He once consulted with key figures in the central government and famous medical figures at home and abroad to initiate the Capital National Hospital. The Central Political Committee has already approved a subsidy of 100,000 yuan for construction costs. Jiao Yitang believes that the hospital is a pioneering undertaking and should be a national model. The equipment must be meticulous and the funds are still insufficient. Therefore, on the 19th of last month, he accompanied the director of the center, Zhang Zhongyu (Xijun), to Shanghai to visit magnates in the Shanghai medical community and various celebrities, and held a banquet at the New Asia Hotel to announce his opinions on soliciting funds for the National Hospital. All sectors expressed their approval, and the details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that Du Yuesheng, Fang Jiaobo, Mao Zijian, Ding Jiwan, Shen Zhongfang, Ding Zhongfang, Zhu Ziyun, Wang Zhongqi, Xia Libin, Xu Xiaopu, Zhu Hegao, Gu Weichuan, Chen Chuxiang, Gao Zhiwen, Cen Zhiliang, Dong Bowei, Xia Qizhen, Kong Zhusan, Ye Chunqiao, Zhu Binglu, Tong Baoqing, Ling Zhijia, Yu Yangzhou, Ling Shoupeng, etc., are responsible for carrying out the work. A meeting was held a few days ago to discuss the matter. Jiao Yitang specially sent Zhang Xijun as a representative to attend and deliver a speech, and ordered him to take the lead in contacting fundraising matters. It is heard that the Shanghai medical community has identified 100,000, and more than 50,000 has already been raised. Several tens of thousands can be remitted to Beijing first on the 10th of this month to facilitate construction immediately. It is also known that similar efforts are being carried out in Tianjin, Nanjing, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Wuxian, Hangzhou, Pinghu and other places. The floor plan of the hospital has already been drafted, and bidding and construction will begin soon.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Members Remaining in Shanghai Prepare to Attend the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports: The Third Plenary Session will be held in Beijing on January 15. Central Committee members remaining in Shanghai will all attend at that time. This reporter recently met with Central Committee member Xue Dubi, who said that he would definitely go to Beijing to attend at that time. It is said that other Central Committee members remaining in Shanghai will also go. Regarding the proposals, because there is still time before the meeting, they have not yet been considered.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Jointly Submit a Petition to the Municipal Government Requesting Negotiations on Water Rate Increases</h3>
<p>And sent a letter to the Taxpayers' Association urging them to argue on reasonable grounds</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation and other organizations jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday requesting negotiations to prevent the British Shanghai Waterworks Company from raising water rates, and sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association urging them to argue on reasonable grounds. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Petition requesting negotiations</p>
<p>The document presented to the Municipal Government stated: "We are submitting this petition regarding the fact that the British Shanghai Waterworks Company in the Public Concession is disregarding the difficult times and raising prices again. We earnestly request that you quickly negotiate to stop this in order to stabilize people's livelihoods. We have investigated that the water rates set by the Shanghai Waterworks in the Public Concession have been charged at 75% of the original price list since April 1935. Users have already felt unable to bear the burden. The company authorities, insatiable in their greed, have recently used the excuse of falling exchange rates and increased expenses to secretly request the approval of the Public Works Department to change to charging 80% of the price, actually raising prices, which is deeply shocking. Therefore, our association held a joint meeting on January 30 to discuss this. Everyone believed that at this time of market depression and suffering for the people's livelihoods, tap water is needed by the public. If prices are raised again, users will be unable to bear the exactions and will provoke incidents. This is of great importance to public tranquility and social order. Moreover, the company's dividends are excellent, and there are many redundant employees, which has long been criticized by all sectors. From 1933 to 1937, the company's expenses increased excessively, and the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department also explicitly rebuked this. If the company is indeed in financial difficulties, it is the result of unreasonable measures. If a solution is desired, the company should be conscious and recognize that tap water is a public utility and should try to reduce profits and save expenses as much as possible. This is the only reasonable way. It was decided that the price increase of the British Shanghai Waterworks Company should be firmly opposed. We hereby state the facts of the matter and earnestly request that you quickly negotiate to stop the price increase in order to stabilize people's livelihoods and maintain the market. This will be convenient for the public. We respectfully submit this petition."</p>
<p>Letter requesting efforts to argue on reasonable grounds</p>
<p>The letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association stated: "We are writing to inform you that the British Shanghai Waterworks Company has decided to change the 75% discount on water charges to 80% starting from February 1 of this year, actually raising prices. All users are opposed to this because it involves an increased burden. A joint meeting of representatives of various organizations was held on January 30, and it was generally agreed that tap water is a beverage for all residents. This public utility should aim at the welfare of the public. In recent years, Shanghai has been affected by the 'January 28th' Shanghai Incident. Commerce and industry are depressed, and empty houses are lined up. Residents have risen up to demand rent reductions in order to maintain the status quo. However, the Shanghai Waterworks Company is disregarding the difficult times and is suddenly using the excuse of falling exchange rates to secretly ask the Public Works Department to change the discount, actually raising prices. It was decided that, in addition to submitting a petition to the Municipal Government requesting serious negotiations, we would also send a letter to the Taxpayers' Association urging them to argue on reasonable grounds. Accordingly, we are sending this letter to request that your association quickly negotiate with the Public Works Department on reasonable grounds and strive to achieve the goal of canceling the price increase in order to maintain the market. This is our earnest hope."</p>
<h3>Zhang Yuanruo Discusses the Chinese Unification Movement</h3>
<p>Two Major Paths: Seeking Unification through the Rule of Law; Seeking Unification through Self-Reliance</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports: The national unification and salvation movement initiated by various sectors in Shanghai has already attracted attention from all parties. This reporter believes that this matter is of great importance and cannot be effective with empty words. Yesterday, he specially visited political commentator Zhang Yuanruo to inquire about his specific opinions on promoting the unification movement. Mr. Zhang gave a detailed discussion as follows:</p>
<p>The whole country must take on the great task</p>
<p>A country is an organic collective. Unified and dynamic, it is the initial stage of completing national construction. If the Chinese nation is unwilling to lag behind and unwilling to be destroyed, it can only unite the entire country, unite from top to bottom, and strive for the construction of a modern and unified country. Therefore, national unification and salvation is undoubtedly an undeniable national policy at present. The entire country should not sit idly by and watch the country disintegrate, and should especially unite to take on and complete this great historical task of national salvation and nation-building.</p>
<p>The core of the problem lies in understanding</p>
<p>However, the essence of the problem, the core of the problem, is not the abstract theoretical debate about whether or not to unify, but the recognition of the correct path to complete unification. In the past, China has not been without unification movements, but historical experience tells us that because unification was not done properly, the more unification was mentioned, the more chaos was brewed, the more unification was wanted, the more division was formed, and the more unification was sought, the more division was manifested.</p>
<p>Two propositions of national theory</p>
<p>The fate of the Chinese nation, along with the deepening of the international crisis, has reached the final moment where a single hair can make a great difference and no further mistakes can be made. Therefore, what we must do now in the national salvation movement is, first, not to take risks and seek luck; second, not to speak empty words and false words, but to have practical, feasible, effective, and appropriate methods. Based on this understanding, I (Zhang said of himself) have never been willing to innovate, aim high, or be pragmatic about national salvation theory. I have always been sincere, practical, and honest. In recent years, I have had two consistent and unchangeable propositions on national affairs: first, legalism; second, self-reliance. These two propositions, although ordinary, have infinite applications. Even when applied to the unification movement, they have their powerful functions.</p>
<p>The relationship between the rule of law and unification</p>
<p>The close relationship between the rule of law movement and the unification movement can be said to be two sides of the same coin. Because the rule of law is something that is rich in universality, or even a tool for unified rule. According to the legalists of the analytical school, laws and decrees are the orders of the sovereign, and sovereignty has internal supremacy and absoluteness, which are the elements that constitute a country. In terms of the function of law, law is the "program of the world and the instrument of all things." The result of the rule of law should be "appointing the public and not the private, appointing the great way and not the small things," "not being a disaster within the law, not being arbitrary outside the law," and absolutely not allowing divergent or divisive actions. From a historical point of view, the reason why European countries can be peacefully unified is "because there is no meaning outside the law or action outside the law." It is the effect of practicing the rule of law and respecting the rule of law. From our own history, the reason why Qin was able to annex the six countries, unify the world, abolish feudalism, establish prefectures and counties, and establish the historical foundation of a great unified country was also the result of advocating and practicing the rule of law.</p>
<p>The relationship between self-reliance and unification</p>
<p>The relationship between self-reliance and unification can be said to be in two aspects. First, it is necessary to work hard on national construction and use economic and transportation construction projects to shorten the distance of space, break down the barriers of regions, increase the connection of interests in various places, and promote the unity of the national spirit of the people throughout the country. The stages of political evolution and economic evolution are corresponding. In 1540, France was divided into 16 governments. Even in 1789, each was still independent and self-governing, with more than a dozen conferences. The reason why European countries were able to destroy the old system of feudalism and establish a unified foundation was the result of the development of economic and transportation enterprises after the industrial revolution. Moreover, given the size of China, we must work hard to build. Secondly, we must create the belief of self-reliance. The work of unification and nation-building must be based entirely on the self-consciousness of the people and the self-reliance of the nation. Since the Republic of China, most people have been warmongering. Wanting to rely on foreign forces to achieve success only results in endless civil wars, only consumes the nation's vitality, and deepens the country's divisions. The recent tragedy in Spain is the result of not knowing self-reliance and relying on foreign forces, which led to the evil consequences of the struggle between the red and black forces. To unify the country, we must first awaken national consciousness, recognize the interests of the country, not be selfish, not be used by others, and be fair and just, creating a central idea that meets the needs of our own country, adjusting the contradictions between left and right, and eliminating ideological struggles. Otherwise, we will inevitably repeat the endless civil wars since the Republic of China, as well as the red and black struggles in Spain. In this way, not only will the unification and nation-building become an unrealizable dream, but the Chinese nation will also kill each other and be divided by the great powers. This is the so-called non-drama of national destruction, which cannot but be guarded against.</p>
<p>There is no other way to unify</p>
<p>The above discussion only involves concepts. To speak of its essence, it still needs special discussion. However, there is no other way to unify. Everything else is secondary. Now that the situation in Shaanxi has improved and the country is at peace, it is hoped that the authorities will take these two meanings as their basis and earnestly plan for them, seeking unification through the rule of law and seeking unification through self-reliance. If there is time in the near future, I will write a special essay to discuss with the people of the country, he said.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Plans to Increase Property Tax by 2% Starting This Year</h3>
<p>Property Industry Association Sends a Letter to the Taxpayers' Association Requesting Negotiations</p>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports: The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association in the Public Concession yesterday, requesting the cancellation of the Public Works Department's plan to increase the property tax by 2%. The letter stated: "We have repeatedly received statements from our members stating that, according to previous reports, the Public Works Department plans to increase the property tax in the concession by 2% across the board starting this year. We are extremely shocked. Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the market has gradually declined, land prices have plummeted, and houses have been mostly empty. This bleak situation is witnessed by all. At ordinary times, the average citizen cannot pay the original rent and tax on time. If the tax is increased, it will make it more difficult for tenants to bear the burden. Even if the Concession authorities feel that this year's budget is insufficient, they should try to save money from the expenditure side. At this time, increasing the burden on citizens will make it difficult for the market to recover. The result will inevitably affect the income of donations and reduce it further, which is not a blessing for the municipal authorities. You should be asked to negotiate on ways to cancel this. We ask that you investigate the matter and handle it accordingly, as it is our deepest hope."</p>

<h3>Detailed Record of the Literary and Art Circles Symposium (Continued)</h3>
<p>Chuan Donghua: Today, we originally invited all of you gentlemen, and you should have expressed your opinions first. Now, the host speaks first, which seems disrespectful. However, the chairman appointed me, so I have to obey. In my opinion, no matter what views anyone usually holds, they cannot be separated from the people of the country. Speaking of the literary and art circles, the first step is to start with oneself. What is the situation of the literary and art circles now? According to the statistics of the Publication Weekly run by Mr. Wang Yunwu, the sales of literary and artistic books are falling year after year. If this continues, we will have nowhere to eat. Considering the interests of the literary and art circles themselves, this phenomenon is very worrying. What methods can we use to save it? We can only have another Renaissance. Saving literature and art is saving our own lives. As everyone knows, unity is a method of relief. However, as Mr. Shao said just now, several attempts at unity have failed. Why did they fail? The reason is that everyone does not have a deep understanding of the meaning of the group. There are only small groups, not large groups. Small group A attacks small group B, so many forces are wasted. On the contrary, the large group has no strength. Therefore, we must transfer this wasted power to engage in the cause of the Renaissance. This is necessary. Secondly, for the Renaissance, we need to have conditions for social stability. This is the case in the literary history of any country. In the past, the strength used by the literary and art circles was not to seek stability in the literary world, but to create chaos in the literary world. Sometimes, the chaos in the literary world even caused disputes throughout society. How can literature and art be revived? Not long ago, this city launched a unified national salvation declaration. I once expressed an opinion, hoping to use peaceful methods to unify the situation of disunity. Now, this hope can be fully realized soon. Since the country has formed a unified situation, our literary and art circles should take this opportunity to transfer the power engaged in civil war in the literary world, unite everyone, and work together to build and revive literature and art. Therefore, a few of us took advantage of the dawning of China's future to invite you all to the meeting to express some opinions. What is the biggest reason why society cannot be stable? On the one hand, it is internal, but an even greater reason than internal is external. Therefore, we further hope to use the power of construction to jointly solve external problems. Only when external problems are solved can society be relatively stable forever. Only when society is stable can there be a possibility of literary and artistic revival. This opinion seems very superficial, but in practice, obstacles often occur in superficial places. Therefore, let’s not talk about other theories today. I hope to further study the stability of society from this superficial place, solve internal and external problems, and stabilize society. Only then can literature and art be revived. This is the greatest hope.</p>
<p>Shao Xunmei: Just now, Mr. Chuan said that it seemed disrespectful for the host to speak first. However, if we don't explain the meaning of this meeting first, I'm afraid you won't understand. So, after I explain, I will ask Mr. Chuan to supplement. Now, I might as well ask Mr. Hong Shen to further supplement the consistent opinions of the hosts.</p>
<p>Hong Shen: Distinguished guests, the six of us invited you to this meeting. I joined the latest, and my attitude may be the most blatant and firm. A few months ago, a friend talked about resisting the enemy. At that time, I said a word: if one day China is officially at war with the enemy, and I personally do not die on the front line, then everything I have said and done in my life is a lie. However, this meaning cannot force others to be the same as me, because everyone has their own views and feelings. Naturally, it is impossible for all literary and art circles to give up their work and go to the battlefield to die. This is just my personal willingness. Now the situation is getting more and more tense every day. Today, there are many things that I could have said politely in the past, but now I have to say them. In the past, there were many concerns, fearing that they would cause misunderstandings and abuses. Today, I have to express them clearly. The first point is that our literary and art circles must be thoroughly united, not just the dozens of people present here today. We must unite all literary and artistic workers across the country. For several years, we don't need to shy away from the fact that there are differences between the left-leaning and right-leaning in the literary and art circles. Now, regardless of whether we are left-leaning or right-leaning, we should put aside our own political thoughts and unite to do the work of saving the country and shedding blood. Everyone present here today, of course, you are all participating in this work. I hope that literary and art circles who are not able to attend due to circumstances will also participate. The first point is that, regardless of whether we are in or out of power, we must unite as one. This is something we don't need to shy away from. Our literary and art circles often have the mentality of being in or out of power. The so-called writers in power are those who are more or less close to the government. The so-called writers out of power are those who take a strict attitude to criticize politics. Now, we should no longer have this mentality. Everyone should unite as one. From my personal standpoint, the current government is working hard for peaceful reunification. Why are there still people who want to oppose it? Of course, everyone should support the government. Now, we are shouting the slogan of 'Unify the country and save the nation.' The slogan doesn't matter. We hope that it will be realized in fact as soon as possible. As long as we truly unify the country and save the nation, we will of course fully support it. You may think that the six of us are a bit strange. Why did we suddenly call this meeting and issue a declaration? But we are all in our thirties and forties. In our own history, we don't seem to be all bastards. Except for me, the other five are not very stupid either. Today, we invite you to the meeting. We must have felt that it was necessary based on our reason and understanding before we invited everyone to this meeting. Finally, I will recite another story. I once read a novel by Mr. Shen Congwen, the general idea of which is that there are two soldiers in the army who fight every day. One time, they carried a basket of rice back to the camp. On the way, they started fighting again, fighting until their heads were bleeding. Fighting is fighting, but the rice still has to be delivered to the camp. Finally, you look at me, I look at you, and the two of them get up and carry the rice to the camp. Now, all writers, between political positions and political positions, even if there have been some grievances in the past, today, we must give up these small grievances and unite to work hard for the biggest grievances. This is my little hope.</p>
<p>Shao Xunmei: We have made our intentions clear. Now, please express your opinions on the declaration of the unified national salvation movement.</p>
<p>Jian Youwen: Today, I am very moved to be invited by the six gentlemen and to hear your opinions. So, I stand up to say a few words. However, I want to declare in advance that my position is the same as yours. It is entirely the position of a writer. Regarding the opinions you have put forward, first, I fully agree with the Shanghai Literary and Art Circles Unified National Salvation Declaration. Second, I especially agree with the organization of the Chinese Literary and Art Association. I have been praying for this matter for a year or two, and I hope that this matter will be established soon. However, let's study it. It's not that there were no literary and art groups in the past. Why did the literary and art groups in the past have no results? There are several reasons for this. First, the literary and art circles have too much individualism, thinking only of themselves and looking down on others. How can this be united? Second, the small groups also have too much individualism. Group A attacks Group B, and Group B attacks Group A. Mutual attacks naturally cannot be united. Now, if we want to unite as a whole, there are a few points to pay attention to. First, it is best not to involve politics and not to engage in political movements, because individuals may have different political positions and political views. If it involves politics and engages in political movements, this association will be difficult to last. For example, if we want to propose to release Zhang Xueliang and let him go back in the association, then this association will have many internal disputes and cannot be established. Second, it is not necessary to seek complete unity of individual thoughts. If individual thoughts are forced, then this association may not be established. The reason why the Writers Association could not succeed in the past was because it had a background of political advocacy and political movements, and it also forced uniformity of individual thoughts. Therefore, I think there is one point that is most likely to organize the Literary and Art Association. Third, break the individualism. In the past, the so-called literary people looked down on each other. Now I dare to put forward a slogan called "Literary people respect each other." A literary person always has his merits, otherwise he would not be a literary person. Since there are merits, of course, we can be friends, and we don't need to look down on each other. Second, we need a group to study learning and literature. To avoid conflicts of individual thoughts, you are left-leaning or right-leaning to what extent, and what are the reasons, we may as well talk about it, and maybe we can communicate. Third, we need to contact each other emotionally. Although we cannot unify our thoughts, our emotions can be unified. Therefore, I put forward another slogan of "Literary people love each other." Based on these three points, to organize the Literary and Art Association, it will definitely be successful. With such a group, it will be easier for us to do things and speak. Finally, although our political views are different, we can always find some common ground. I believe that no one opposes patriotism, and no one does not approve of shedding blood and sacrificing for China. Based on this goal, we can unite and do our best. I believe that this will be of great benefit to the whole, to China, to culture, and to individuals.</p>
<p>Fan Zhongyun: At this time, everyone has realized the point of talking about unified national salvation. After the Xi'an Incident, Zhang Xueliang went to Nanjing, and the recent peaceful settlement of the Shaanxi situation all indicate that the general public has realized that China needs unity and can no longer have internal strife. However, I feel that people in the literary and art circles do not seem to have felt the significant impact of this trend of thought. The reason for this has already been said by someone, that the personality of literary people is too heavy and they look down on each other. But there is another reason, which is the result of the invasion of imperialism. How do you say this? You must know that imperialism not only uses military and economic means to invade, but also uses thought to invade. This is a great blow to Chinese culture. The reason why China has been able to unify for thousands of years is entirely due to the consistent culture of thousands of years. Chinese culture has not only unified China, but also unified the entire East. Countries such as Japan, Siam, Annam, and Korea have all been influenced by Chinese culture. Since the forces of imperialism invaded, they have destroyed China's inherent culture, and many people have forgotten the need for unity of their own nation and followed others. Just now, Mr. Jian said that no one opposes patriotism, but a few years ago, I was scolded as a patriot and opposed. At that time, we should talk about internationalism. When the three northeastern provinces were lost, we still heard the slogan of "Supporting the Soviet Motherland." With the "Soviet Motherland," is there still a Motherland China? Can a person have two motherlands? After this kind of thinking invaded, it made the unification of Chinese culture suffer a blow. Everyone can see the military invasion and economic invasion of imperialism. Therefore, everyone is indignant and wants to resist the enemy and defend against foreign aggression. But in the case of ideological anaesthesia, people do not know how they died even when they are dead. Because there is an ideological invasion and the unification of culture is destroyed, it is not easy for the unified situation in China to succeed. Especially at the present time, if we want to truly unify, we must not only be internal but also external. For example, recovering the four northeastern provinces is the true unified national salvation. However, recovering the four northeastern provinces is related to international relations. At this time of internal and external troubles, should our thinking be based on the Chinese nation? After recognizing this point, I feel even more the necessity of cultural and ideological unity. Just now, a gentleman said that as long as we can unify spiritually and ideologically, material construction will not be a problem. This is very true. Let's look at the Western countries. All countries with backward industries especially need spiritual development and unity. France's capitalist production system is not as developed as Britain's, but the French Revolution and the ideas of freedom and equality led Britain. Germany's industrial development was even later than France's, but Germany worked hard on philosophical thought, so German philosophy led the world. Russia's economic development was later than that of Britain and France, but it surpassed the whole world in terms of socialist thought. Since China's industry is backward, it needs a cultural movement even more. With a cultural movement, it can promote the unification movement and promote economic construction through spiritual construction. Therefore, I very much agree with the proposals of the six gentlemen. However, there may be some imperfections in the wording of this declaration. It is best to ask everyone to express their opinions and revise it, so as to promote a true society with everyone's opinions. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Donation Transfers by This Museum in January</h3>
<p>All have been transferred to Chairman Chuan in full</p>
<p>Since our museum has already widely adopted the mechanism of collecting donations to aid Suiyuan, we specially stopped collecting donations at the end of December last year to complete the process. We also published an announcement in the newspaper. However, gentlemen from other places still remit donations from afar. In addition to issuing receipts, our museum transfers the donations to Chairman Chuan in Suiyuan as soon as they are received. Now, we disclose the various donations transferred in January and the titles of the senders as follows:</p>

<p>The above totals 3,013 yuan in national currency. In addition to the 2,380.86 yuan that has been remitted to Chairman Chuan in Suiyuan in succession, another 632.14 yuan was remitted today, totaling 3,013 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ministry Member Visits Shanghai to Inspect Fire Control</h3>
<p>In view of the importance of fire control in the area of North Sichuan Road Hongkou in Shanghai, where Chinese and foreigners live together, the Ministry of Interior of the National Government, Director of the Police Administration Department of the Ministry, Feng Yukun, and Inspector and Section Chief of the Ministry, Jiang Tianqing, came to Shanghai together and visited the Zhabei Third Section Fire Brigade. They were received by Deng Yecheng, the director of the association. They inquired in detail about fire prevention. They then visited the facilities and were very satisfied. Officers of the Fire Protection Unit of the Municipal Police Department also followed and arrived. The police station on North Sichuan Road also sent additional police officers to the gate of the Zhabei Third Section Fire Brigade to guard the post to protect them and take photos as a memorial.</p>
<h3>Special Cash Guarantee Method (Continued)</h3>
<p>Full Text Published by the Bankers Association</p>
<p>II. For Bank Employees</p>
<p>Firstly, after the implementation of this method, employees can be exempted from finding guarantors and the various difficulties of begging relatives and friends to continue guaranteeing during annual guarantee renewals. Seeking help from others is not as good as relying on oneself. Secondly, adopting this method eliminates the need to pay huge insurance premiums annually, as with the credit insurance system. It also avoids the situation of using a 'limited guarantee,' where, if the limit is too high, it may deter potential guarantors and lead them to withdraw their guarantees. Thirdly, because this method has provisions for joint and several liability, the various funds collected are rarely used. When a substantial amount has accumulated, a portion can be allocated annually to establish schools for employees' children, consumer cooperatives, clubs, sports fields, libraries, and other welfare facilities. This will greatly benefit the employees' physical and mental well-being. Moreover, Article 21 of the plan has already stipulated the funds to be used, which ensures that it will not be like the nominal welfare facilities that commercial circles have organized in the past.</p>
<p>Fourthly, due to the provisions for joint and several liability and the deduction of Class B guarantee deposits, all colleagues will be able to care for each other in their duties, which will enhance camaraderie, mutual supervision, and prevention of fraud.</p>
<p>Fifthly, the Class B guarantee deposits paid by employees each month, excluding compensation for losses due to fraud (in fact, with the provisions for joint and several liability, fraudulent activities can be reduced), will be refunded to employees upon leaving their positions. The amount of refund will be determined based on the length of service, which is tantamount to incorporating a savings element into the payment of insurance premiums.</p>
<p>Sixthly, when the Class A guarantee deposits and public reserve funds accumulate to a considerable amount, in addition to using part of it for welfare projects, the bank may, at its discretion, invest in various productive enterprises to increase the benefits for both employees and the bank. This is similar to the lending practices of American credit insurance companies.</p>
<p>Seventhly, according to statistics from American credit insurance companies, the actual revenue from insurance premiums, after deducting discounts, commissions, and miscellaneous expenses, is only about 65% to 75%. This method is practical and does not have such losses.</p>
<p>Precautions for Implementing the 'Special Cash Guarantee Method'</p>
<p>First, adopting the 'Special Cash Guarantee Method' requires determination, perseverance, and spirit. It is absolutely essential not to implement cash guarantees and insurance policies simultaneously, as this would not only fail to alleviate the pain of employees seeking guarantors but would also increase their financial burden in vain (however, this can be temporarily delayed when first implementing).</p>
<p>Second, when hiring employees, except for highly appointed personnel, procedures such as written and oral examinations should be followed. The past experience, work performance, and integrity of applicants should be thoroughly investigated. Caution should be exercised, and after hiring, there should be letters of recommendation from two people proving their good character. Such procedures should be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Third, seeking ease and avoiding work are human nature. Bank employees, living in the extravagant society of the city, are easily misled if their will is weak, leading to disgrace and ruin. Examining the origins of fraud, more than 60% stem from a speculative and侥幸 mentality, hoping to profit and repay past debts. If they fail, they will inevitably resort to embezzlement and fraud. Therefore, to eliminate fraud, speculation must be strictly prohibited, employees' leisure activities must be improved, and employee training should be initiated to enhance their moral character. Such measures can actively cultivate good character in employees, and strictly prohibiting speculation and paying attention to daily words and deeds can passively prevent the motivation for fraud. Article 21 of the aforementioned plan already stipulates the source of funds for welfare facilities, making it even easier to implement.</p>
<p>Fourth, the duties assigned to employees must be as suitable as possible for their personalities, and their family income and expenses must be objectively assessed so that they can enjoy their work today and have hope for the future. This will stabilize their lives, calm their minds, and naturally increase their efficiency. If there are already employee dormitories, the close interaction of colleagues can further encourage each other and achieve greater results. Moreover, dormitory managers can closely supervise and assess each resident.</p>
<p>Fifth, in any organization, if one person specializes in one task for a long time, not only will they feel monotonous, but it will also easily lead to malpractices. Employees of all levels in British banks are often rotated, so cases of fraud are relatively rare compared to other countries. Therefore, employees should be transferred after holding a certain position for a considerable period to avoid the development of bad habits. From the employee's perspective, learning new skills can also increase interest.</p>
<p>Sixth, the 'Special Cash Guarantee Method' should be strictly enforced according to regulations without hesitation. Making concessions to the environment may endanger the effectiveness of the entire method. Furthermore, the definition of the word 'employee' must be carefully considered as each bank has a different organization.</p>
<p>Seventh, if an employee commits fraud and conceals it, the original recommender should have the responsibility to immediately or at any time report the employee's conduct to the bank or send them to the bank. When hiring employees, the recommender should also sign and acknowledge this responsibility in the employee's resume and application form. After the abolition of guarantors, the bank becomes even more unfamiliar with the origins of employees, making it difficult to investigate when incidents occur. Therefore, requiring recommenders to report employees' conduct can reduce the abuse of favoritism and recommendations.</p>
<p>Eighth, in the event of fraud, in addition to criminal penalties and civil compensation being handled strictly according to law without any leniency, the name and photo of the perpetrator should be published in newspapers when necessary to prevent the rogue from rejoining society in the future.</p>
<p>Ninth, joint and several liability is the essence of this method. However, before implementation, a thorough investigation should be conducted to ensure clear responsibility and strive for fairness.</p>
<p>Tenth, employees with upright character and careful public service should be rewarded by the bank to commend them.</p>
<p>Eleventh, various articles of the employee service guarantee rules must be carefully drafted so that there is a basis for subsequent actions.</p>
<p>Twelfth, to facilitate the implementation of the cash guarantee draft, detailed implementation rules should be formulated to specify all implementation procedures. For banks with a small number of employees, they can cooperate with other banks to achieve the same results.</p>
<p>Thirteenth, each bank's accounting system must be strictly organized to make the new method more effective.</p>
<p>Fourteenth, auditors should be sent to each branch at any time to audit accounts and business operations. However, the personnel sent must be extremely secretive and carry credentials with their name, position, and photo attached to prevent infiltration by criminals. It is said that this is widely used in the British banking industry.</p>
<p>Fifteenth, at the beginning of their employment, employees should issue a written oath declaring absolute compliance with the joint and several liability and other regulations stipulated in the 'Special Cash Guarantee Method' and never evade or shirk responsibility.</p>
<p>Sixteenth, cashiers and custodians of cash and negotiable instruments must not concurrently hold accounting or other positions.</p>
<p>Seventeenth, inspections of cash custody and accounts should be conducted internally and externally simultaneously.</p>
<p>Eighteenth, document signatures should be countersigned, and receipts and payments should be processed by at least two people.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Modern group organizations adopt a division of labor due to the complexity of affairs and the diversity of functions, while also emphasizing the spirit of cooperation. The work of each member of the group must be coordinated and adjusted through the cooperation of all members in order to operate flexibly. An individual's duties must be connected through the group to form an organic system, with the beginning and end corresponding and the veins running through, in order to exert its functions. Therefore, analyzing an individual's duties from the group's point of view has a social meaning and cannot be ignored. Looking back at our country's guarantee system, each person still individually seeks a guarantor, fills out a guarantee form, and is responsible to the group separately. Everyone plans for themselves and does not communicate with each other. The organization of affairs has reached the stage of collective division of labor, but the guarantee system has not yet shed the color of individualism, which is a contradiction in China's commercial management. People advocate the 'Special Cash Guarantee Method,' which has Class A guarantee deposits as self-guarantees, collects Class B guarantee deposits, and allocates internal guarantee deposits as public guarantees. It also makes people in related positions in the same industry jointly responsible, so that the duties and character of the staff in the same group are closely linked, sweeping away the malpractices of the past individualistic guarantee system, conforming to the modern 'massism' and the spirit of 'social connection,' and harmonizing with the collective division of labor organization. This is the theoretical basis of this method. Furthermore, new-style banks and shops, for the sake of careful review and prevention of loopholes, strictly implement 'internal checks and balances,' so each business process goes through the hands of several people, plus the application of the 'balance' principle in accounting. For preventing fraud, it cannot be said to be completely ineffective. However, this kind of mechanical check and balance can only supervise each other in form. Using it to manage modern groups with busy affairs is still insufficient. The repeated occurrence of fraud cases in the past is clear evidence of this. Although we do not expect the 'Special Cash Guarantee Method' to be completely free of malpractices, in addition to the mechanical supervision in the original office work, it can also promote spiritual unity, so it can be concluded that it will be effective. Therefore, those who do not understand the deep meaning of this method may suspect why colleagues should be held jointly and severally liable for one person's fraud, which is not only unreasonable but also encourages wrongdoing. However, after reading the above explanation, they will surely understand.</p>
<p>I have heard of one person guaranteeing several or dozens of people. If fraud occurs among the guaranteed, the guarantor invites the guaranteed to be responsible for sharing the compensation; otherwise, the entire guarantee will be withdrawn. All the guaranteed agree unanimously. This is a common fact in Shanghai's commercial circles. Analyzing the funds paid by the guaranteed for joint and several compensation, its nature is almost close to mutual guarantee funds, which shows that jointly allocating funds to prepare for compensation for fraud losses is actually a situation that has evolved. The Class B guarantee deposit in the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" is only adopting the existing habit. Moreover, central government agencies such as the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways have already adopted cash guarantees for their accounting and cashier personnel. The government agencies have already advocated it first, and the banking industry follows suit, which is also an inevitable trend. In short, the personal credit guarantee system has its own historical significance in the past agricultural and handicraft society. Today, our country has evolved from a simple agricultural economy to an industrial and commercial economy. The trend of the times is that personal guarantees will be eliminated. The new guarantee system will respond to the needs of the situation and fulfill its historical mission, without a doubt. Looking at the major foreign banks in Shanghai, those that use the insurance policy system are rare. Those that are still in use are mostly guarantees from compradors to the bank, which is not sufficient to be a definitive conclusion. However, the 'Special Cash Guarantee Method' that we advocate is only a suggestion to correct the shortcomings of the current bank guarantee system and explore new system paths. Although whether it will produce malpractices during implementation remains to be indicated by experience, if it is promoted in a revolutionary manner, cutting through thorns and thistles without the slightest fear, there will be good results. Considering and gaining, there is an ancient proverb, so I will not hesitate to provide my humble opinion for discussion, and I hope for your wise decision and correction, and I will be grateful and increased.

<h3>The China Mercy Childcare Association Held Its 8th Annual Meeting the Day Before Yesterday (Continued)</h3>
<p>President Kong Xiangxi Presided in Person; Passed the Work Outline for the 26th Year</p>
<p>Mr. Pan's Speech</p>
<p>Director of the Social Bureau, Pan Gongzhan (represented by Zhang Binghui), delivered a speech entitled "Today's Childcare Undertakings in China." The original text is as follows: Our country only began to pay attention to children's issues after the rise of new education, and deeply felt that it was necessary to advocate child-centered education. Therefore, from the "Spartan" style of extreme destruction of children's individuality and the barbaric education of freedom, it has transformed into an education that creates free growth and development of individuality, which is suitable for the social and human evolution, and gradually recognized that "the 20th century is the century of children." However, strictly speaking, China's children's education only entered a new stage of development after the reform of educational policies in the 7th year of the Republic of China and the arrival of scholars such as Dewey and Mencius. Our country's education circles also have a deep understanding of the true meaning of children's education, but education must be a practical action. It is not enough to only understand some theories or to understand the importance of children's welfare. We must mobilize social forces and move towards the stage of practice. The China Mercy Childcare Association was created for this requirement and comprehensively seeks the welfare of general children in society. This cannot be said not to be the most concrete microcosm of China's childcare undertakings. Regarding the sacred cause of children and the welfare of the entire society, the development of the China Mercy Childcare Association's business must be multi-faceted, and its tasks are also very heavy. I am very happy to be at the 8th Annual Meeting of the China Mercy Childcare Association. All of you present are gentlemen and ladies who are enthusiastic about children's happiness and educating children. For the sake of the future of the Chinese nation and the current national crisis, dare to sincerely hope that everyone will pay close attention to the problem of increasing the happiness of our next generation and newborn children, so that every parent and teacher with children will become excellent nannies, and finally complete the task of national nannies. Therefore, with 110,000 enthusiasm, I would like to pay infinite respect to the nannies of the Chinese nation, and offer a little suggestion to colleagues engaged in childcare undertakings, hoping that everyone will discuss: (1) In terms of advocacy, we must make everyone know to respect children, cherish and protect children, and treat children as members of society, seeking children's happiness is the most effective behavior to ensure social welfare. Running children's welfare undertakings is not the result of a minority's compassion, but the discovery of the whole people's obligations. I hope that children's welfare undertakings institutions can develop in multiple directions, such as education, relief, protection of children, and various health institutions, which is the minimum attention we pay to increasing the happiness of children. (2) In terms of education, in addition to urging and assisting school education, we must also pay attention to the education of parents. In the past, we only recognized children as the object of education, but we did not know that parents are more important objects of education. As a result, children's education only dares to achieve very little effect. For example, 'Parents Education Research Association,' 'Nanny Education,' 'Wet Nurse Training,' 'Maternity Knowledge'... etc., have been extremely neglected. In the future, we should pay special attention to this point, so that parents' education and children's education will be carried out in parallel. (3) Relief and protection, most children live in suffering and are very unfortunate, which is everywhere. We should start with both the root cause and the symptoms, and promote the enactment and implementation of legal provisions related to children's relief and protection. In terms of treating the symptoms, we should pay attention to the establishment of relief agencies, which specialize in accommodating vagrant children and disabled children. In addition, relief such as orphanages, nurseries, children's parks, and the liberation of maids, and prohibiting the abuse of apprentice child laborers are also very important. It must be known that relieving children is the first step in protecting children's welfare. Therefore, general unfortunate children cannot talk about protection before they have received social relief. If there is no problem with life, of course, we can use protection methods to enable them to obtain a happy and fulfilling life. (4) In terms of health, we must practically promote the physical and mental health of children and their balanced development. Childcare institutions should have regular health guidance, so that the two departments of family health and children's health should have activities in terms of children's disease visits, mobile treatment, and special attention should be paid to children's mental health. Regarding this point, I very much hope that the China Mercy Childcare Association will be able to establish a mental health clinic in the shortest possible time to help children with mental disorders. The value to society is very great, and it can especially reduce children's crime. If there is a mental health clinic, the children's court can also be dispensed with. The above points are what China's childcare undertakings are striving to implement today, and they are also important guidelines for future development. Whether it is any nature, different children's mercy institutions, or children's central movement, such as Children's Year, Children's Happiness Society, Children's Holiday Homework Society, and various implementations of children's and youth camping, are all aimed at the happiness of children as the only object. Therefore, we must advance with these major goals, so that the happiness of children can be established from the external development of childcare undertakings, and reflect the vigor of society. I can definitely say that engaging in childcare undertakings is the most pleasant and valuable service to society. I personally admire it very much. Finally, I would like to respectfully wish all ethnic nannies good health.</p>

<h3>Tragedy at the New Asia Hotel</h3>
<p>Traveler's Son Falls from the Sixth Floor and Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Room No. on the sixth floor of the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road was occupied by a traveler named Ge from Nanjing a few days ago. Ge is from Anhui and came with his wife and others. Yesterday at noon, Ge was receiving visitors in the room, while his young son, Ge Lin, who was only a few years old, was playing with other children in the bathroom. Unexpectedly, because the bathroom window was not closed, Ge's child climbed up, leaning on the edge of the window bathtub, looking down. The child lost his balance and fell out of the bathroom window, headfirst down, falling on Tiantong Road. The child's head was broken, brain blood splattered, and his leg bones were also broken. He died immediately. When the other children screamed, Ge's father rushed in to see, but it was too late. Peeking down, he saw his own son lying dead on the road, and cried out in great grief. He rushed down to investigate. At this time, the nearby patrol police also arrived after hearing the alarm. The child was immediately sent to the Bazilu Sanitarium Hospital for advice, but it was already too late to return the soul, so he had to transfer the child's body to the coroner's office, pending a coroner's inquest this morning.</p>
<h3>Mu Shuzai Will Be Cremated Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>Held at the Public Works Department Crematorium</p>
<p>Mr. Mu Shuzai, a senior gentleman in this city, passed away at noon on the 30th of last month. Yesterday at 2:00 pm, the coffin was placed in the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. More than 100 people from all walks of life, including Huang Renzhi, Gu Xinyi, and Tan Boying, came to offer condolences. The ceremony was simple and quiet. First, his brother Mu Ouchu reported on the course of the illness and treatment, saying, "My brother has a strong physique and extraordinary energy. He personally served for all local public welfare. In his later years, his blood pressure increased. Doctors and relatives repeatedly advised him to avoid being busy and to rest quietly. However, because of his nature, he was eager to be fair and righteous, so he did not pay attention. Therefore, since he suffered from cerebral hemorrhage on the 23rd of last month, although all methods have been exhausted, they have not been able to save him." After the speech, relatives and friends saluted and paid their respects to the remains. This time he was ill, he did not suffer, so his appearance was as if he were alive. During his lifetime, he was generous to others, and firmly instructed that he should be cremated after his death, and that the land in Yanghuan Township, Pudong, should not be occupied, in order to promote society. It is now scheduled to leave the International Funeral Home at 8:30 am on the 2nd of the month, passing through Kangnaot Road, Hede Road, and turning into Jing'an Temple Road to the Public Works Department Crematorium. The cremation will be held at 9:30 am. People from all walks of life, and important staff from the Shanghai South and Public Concession and French Concession fire brigades, will go to hold the rope.</p>
<h3>The False Accusation of a Lawyer Will Be Thoroughly Investigated</h3>
<p>Zhang Jinrong Cries Bitterly, Begging the Court for Lenience</p>
<p>Lawyer Xuan Zhendong, acting as an agent for a rent collector, filed a lawsuit against Zhang Jinrong of Huaian, residing at No. 29 Gonghe Road, Zhabei, for arrears in rent. The Jiangsu High Court's second instance concluded that the amount owed was less than five hundred yuan, and according to the law, there was no third instance. Therefore, it was in the process of execution. Zhang Jinrong harbored resentment towards lawyer Xuan and falsely accused him at the District Court Procuratorate of fraud and breach of trust. He claimed that after the High Court's judgment, Xuan instructed Chen Jingqiu to come to a settlement, agreeing to resolve the matter with thirty yuan and not to appeal further. Unexpectedly, the creditor then proceeded with the execution to recover the debt, thus alleging that the lawyer committed fraud and breach of trust. Prosecutor Tang Rutiao opened a court investigation, finding that Zhang Jinrong owed more than three hundred yuan but only paid over thirty. How could that be a settlement? Moreover, since the amount was less than five hundred yuan, there was no legal basis for a third instance appeal. How could Xuan Zhendong, as a lawyer, not know the law and advise against the appeal? This was clearly a false accusation. The prosecutor then indicted Zhang Jinrong in court yesterday. Judge Miao opened the court, and Zhang Jinrong testified that he did not want to sue but was instigated by Wu Xiao-kai, also known as Wu Haibing, who runs a small hotel on Hengfeng Road. "I was really tricked," he said, begging the judge to show mercy, considering his family of over ten members, and burst into tears. However, the investigating officer found that the drafter of the complaint was Guo Zhang, from the law firm of lawyer Jidengyuan, and Jixun was Zhang's defense attorney. The officer then asked lawyer Ji, who claimed he had not written it and that it was a blank form that was used without his permission. He stated that the matter should be investigated. The victim, Xuan Zhendong, filed a civil suit, requesting that the judgment be published in the newspaper to restore his reputation. The judge instructed that the case should be thoroughly investigated before further hearings.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Refuses the Road Workers' Demands</h3>
<p>Decides to Proceed with a Lottery Independently; Yu Qiaqing Will Mediate Today</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, over one thousand two hundred road workers of the Public Concession Municipal Council have been on a joint strike since the day before yesterday to protest against the Works Department's plan to lay off workers through a lottery system. The Municipal Council Works Department has decided to reject the road workers' demands. Both sides are taking extreme positions. Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing is scheduled to approach the Municipal Council today for mediation. The sentiments of the various parties are recorded below:</p>
<p>Independent Lottery</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Engineering Department originally planned to convene all road workers at the Engineering Department at 9:00 AM on the 30th to await the lottery for layoffs and to recall all work permits. Retained road workers would be issued new badges for identification. Unexpectedly, all road workers unanimously opposed the plan and went on a joint strike, making it impossible to carry out the lottery procedure. Therefore, it was temporarily postponed. It is now learned that the Bureau has decided not to interrupt its policy direction and will implement the lottery independently. After the procedures are completed, the road workers who are retained and those who are laid off will be notified. Meanwhile, work permits will be revoked at their addresses.</p>
<p>Refusal of Requests</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Dagong News Agency inquired with the Municipal Council Engineering Department about how the various reasons and requests raised by the road workers to withdraw the layoff order would be handled. The responsible person of the Bureau stated that this layoff of nine-tenths of the road workers is one of the Municipal Council's methods of reducing staff and expenses, and it has already been decided at a meeting. It cannot be changed casually or revoked due to the workers' strike. In fact, there is no way to reverse it. Moreover, the lottery is a very fair way to determine who stays and who leaves. Even for the laid-off workers, the Bureau can still employ them as temporary workers when the road maintenance work is busy, so they will not be immediately unemployed. The Bureau believes that the road workers' sudden strike is likely due to instigation, and the Bureau is conducting a thorough investigation. It hopes that the workers will not be incited by outsiders and will implement the established methods.</p>
<p>Continuing the Strike</p>
<p>Yesterday, all the road workers continued their strike and decided that at 9:00 AM this morning, Li Jingchun, Liu Huanwen, Zhang Buying, Cai Furong, and Wang Shuangcai would form a petition delegation to petition various agencies, including the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government, requesting assistance to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Forming a Picket Line</p>
<p>After the road construction workers of the Municipal Council implemented a joint strike, in order to maintain order, the delegation decided to organize a picket line, with ten people from each of the seven districts of Andong Road, He Road, Shajing Road, Tangsi Road, Suzhou Road, Maigen Road, and Datong Road, totaling seventy people, divided into seven teams, taking turns to be responsible for picket duties to avoid incidents.</p>
<p>Yu's Mediation</p>
<p>After receiving a request for relief from the road construction workers, Municipal Council Director Yu Qiaqing believed that the livelihoods of the road workers would be precarious once they were laid off, and it was also related to local security during the winter prevention period. Therefore, he decided to go to the Municipal Council this morning to meet with Director-General Fei Liyong to discuss a solution and to reply to the road workers on the mediation process at 5:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>Citizens' Expression</p>
<p>The various district branches of the First Special District Citizens' Union, including the seventh, twelfth, sixteenth, twenty-seventh, and thirty-eighth districts, believe that the Municipal Council's current reduction of expenditures does not start with senior foreign staff but rather lays off Chinese workers who earn only a few angles of wages per day, causing a strike. Yesterday, they specifically affixed their seals to a letter to the Municipal Council, making a serious representation, requesting that the Works Department be instructed to withdraw the order.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Amendments to the Draft of Regulations for Income Tax Collection</h3>
<p>Letter from Pan Xulun, Li Wenjie, and Others to the Income Tax Affairs Office</p>
<p>Accountants Pan Xulun, Gu Xun, Qian Nai Cheng, Li Wenjie, Li Hongshou, Chen Wenlin, Tang Wenrui and others from the Lixin Accounting Firm in this city, yesterday sent a letter to the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, stating that they believe that the draft of the Regulations for Income Tax Collection should be supplemented and amended. The original letter stated: "In continuation, Xulun and others submitted a letter on the 22nd of this month, detailing the points that Xulun and others believe should be amended in the draft of the Regulations for the Collection of Class I Income Tax promulgated by the Ministry, which was duly noted. Now, the points that Xulun and others believe should be supplemented in the draft of the Regulations for the Collection of Class I Income Tax, and the points that should be amended and supplemented in the draft of the Regulations for the Collection of Class II and Class III Income Tax, are listed below. With our humble opinion, we hope that it will be considered and adopted."</p>
<p>A. Points that should be supplemented in the draft of the Regulations for the Collection of Class I Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax: ⑴ There are many cases where there are business establishments both domestically and abroad, but there is no independent accounting of the business donations and benefits between the head office and branches, and they cannot be calculated separately. In such cases, the domestic and foreign business income must be divided. There are only two ways to implement the division: one is the allocation method, and the other is the estimation method. However, the standards for allocation and estimation are not specified in the collection regulations and should be supplemented. Otherwise, those with head offices and branches both domestically and abroad will definitely have no way to calculate the domestic or foreign portion of their income. ⑵ Article 2 of the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulates that the income of foreign diplomats is exempt from taxation. However, this provision is too crude. Does the term "diplomat" only refer to formal diplomats such as ambassadors, ministers, and chargés d'affaires, or does it include consuls and employees of embassies and consulates? Does the term "income" only refer to the salary income of their diplomatic duties, or does it refer to income other than their duties, such as interest on securities deposits and business profits, which are also tax-exempt? These should also be clearly stipulated in the collection regulations for remedy. ⑶ The draft of the Regulations for the Collection of Class I Income Tax provides detailed regulations on how to calculate the revenue of ordinary retail stores and manufacturing factories, but there are no regulations on how to calculate the revenue of profit-seeking enterprises with special characteristics, such as insurance companies, construction companies, and installment payment sales stores. There are many such manufacturers in China, and they will inevitably feel at a loss when filing and paying taxes in the future. It seems that appropriate regulations should be made in the collection regulations immediately. ⑷ How should "public dues" be interpreted, and what should be included in its content? It seems that supplementary regulations should be provided because there is a big difference in the types and nature of public dues. Not all public dues can be deducted from the revenue. For example, the land appreciation tax and the special levy for road improvement (Special Assessment), as well as all levies that can increase the value of the taxpayer's assets, should not be included in the deductible amount but should be treated as capital expenditures. Also, should capital taxes, business taxes, and income taxes paid to foreign governments be regarded as public dues and deducted uniformly? These should be clearly stipulated in the collection regulations because there are many companies registered in Hong Kong and the United States within China's borders. ⑸ How should the depletion of all mining land and forest land of mining and forestry institutions be calculated? There is no clear provision in the collection regulations, and it seems that it should be supplemented. ⑹ Article 12 of the Implementing Rules states, "The purchase and sale of items, securities, or gold and silver currency that are unrelated to the business and whose income is not calculated under the income of the business shall be regarded as a one-time profit-seeking enterprise." This article on purchase and sale must set a time limit, for example, if the purchased item is still sold within two years, one year, or several months, and there is income, it should be taxed (this time limit should be increased or decreased depending on whether the nature of the item is a fixed asset or a current asset). If the sale is outside this time limit, it is a capital increase (Capital Increment) rather than a temporary profit, and income tax should not be paid. This time limit is extremely important. Since it is not stipulated in the Implementing Rules, it should be supplemented in the collection regulations to avoid disputes. ⑺ Article 15 of the draft stipulates that "last year's losses shall not be included in this year's calculation," which is consistent with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations and the Implementing Rules, but in fact, it does make taxpayers feel distressed. For example, a company with a capital of 100,000 yuan has been losing money for several years, accumulating losses of 80,000 yuan in total. This year, it is fortunate to have a chance to make a profit of 30,000 yuan, which is not enough to make up for the previous losses of 50,000 yuan. How can it have the ability to pay taxes? If the loss in the previous year cannot be offset against this year's profit, then it must pay the highest rate of income tax of one per thousand this year, which is one thousand yuan. The government is too harsh on taxpayers and goes against the principle of the ability to pay taxes. According to British law, losses within six years are allowed to be offset against this year's profit, which is the only way to cultivate tax sources. It seems that China should adopt this method. Although this is a problem in the regulations, it seems that it cannot be raised when discussing the collection regulations. However, in fact, there are many provisions in the draft of the collection regulations that correct or remedy the shortcomings of the regulations and implementing rules. The point that last year's losses can be offset seems to be among the remedies. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>National Handicraft Exhibition Soliciting Various Products</h3>
<p>Collection Points Established at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; A Pre-Exhibition Will Be Held in April</p>
<p>The General Assembly of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee will hold a National Handicraft Exhibition in the capital on May 1 to develop local special products. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has been ordered to solicit various handicrafts from the industrial and commercial circles of this city for submission to the capital for exhibition at that time. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Soliciting Products</p>
<p>The General Assembly of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee has commissioned the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to solicit various handicrafts for submission to the capital for display and exhibition at that time. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has appointed Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan as a special commissioner.

<h3>Ministry of Education Advocates Instilling Insurance Knowledge</h3>
<p>The China Insurance Society and the Shanghai Insurance Trade Association are jointly requesting the Ministry of Education to instruct major bookstores to include insurance materials in textbooks in order to promote insurance knowledge. On the 4th of this month, a reply was received from the Ministry of Education, which stated: "Your telegram has been received. The request to add a section on insurance materials to textbooks for primary schools and public schools has been noted. The primary school curriculum standards have been revised and promulgated, which includes a savings item, which naturally includes insurance materials. In the future, when compiling teaching outlines, the insurance item can be included in the outlines. As for public school textbooks, they have already been compiled. In the future, when revising them, insurance materials can also be added." Therefore, the Insurance Society and the Insurance Trade Association immediately dispatched personnel to contact major bookstores. All bookstores expressed their approval and decided to include insurance materials in textbooks. From now on, insurance knowledge can be gradually instilled in the minds of young people in our country.</p>
<h3>The Effectiveness of Life Insurance</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mingting</p>
<p>Life insurance is a type of insurance system that applies the principle of human mutual assistance and precise scientific calculations to distribute the losses suffered by individuals due to life risks to a group of many people, so that the unfortunate can be rescued and people's livelihoods can be guaranteed. Its function is sufficient to stabilize individual life, consolidate social organization, and promote national prosperity. It is the most important undertaking in modern social economic organization. It has long been successful in European and American countries. Our country today is in a time of economic decline, people's livelihood is poor, and society is unstable. This kind of undertaking is really a targeted medicine. The whole country should jointly promote it and actively advance it, in order to harvest the great effect of national recovery. The general efficacy is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For the individual: Work at sunrise and rest at sunset, supporting parents and raising children, this is the normal course of life. However, misfortune is uncertain, and life and death are fixed. If something unexpected happens to a person, the economic source of the whole family who depend on it for a living will be cut off, and there will be no source for the needs of the elderly and young to be supported and educated. The tragic scene can be described! Ordinary people often feel depressed and uneasy because of this worry about the future, and the impact often leads to a passive life. If you join life insurance, the amount to be obtained in the future is enough to remedy the occurrence of unfortunate events? And to use it to take care of their affairs, so that the whole family can eliminate the worry of danger, and the individual can obtain peace of mind and body. This kind of psychological influence is enough to increase the vitality of life, cultivate moral improvement, promote the effectiveness of work, and contribute to the development of the entire nation's future, which is very large. Looking at the mortality rate of those who have life insurance, it is significantly lower than the mortality rate of the general population, which can be a significant proof of fact. Therefore, Hucbnere said: "All those who have the obligation to support their families should use life insurance to protect themselves... We should regard those who are not insured as criminals." These words are enough to explain how important life insurance is to the individual.</p>
<p>(2) For society: Life insurance is originally a social policy; in the passive aspect, it can prevent social diseases, such as poverty, unemployment, crime, and lack of education. All the bad phenomena caused by economic deficiency can be eliminated. In the active aspect, it can increase social welfare, such as charity, education, health, treatment, etc. All the plans related to people's lives can be used to organize, so that society will gradually move towards a healthy and bright field, and its effect is very great. The accumulated funds of life insurance in European and American countries are also mostly invested in public welfare professions; it is sufficient to show that life insurance is the driving force for building a modern society. As for the spiritual effect of life insurance on society, it is even more difficult to estimate; such as cultivating the habit of saving, the customs of thrift, the spirit of mutual assistance, and the concept of ethics, all have a great relationship with the progress of society.</p>
<p>(3) For the country: In addition to benefiting individual life and social organization, life insurance also has an extremely great effect, which is to concentrate the floating capital of the people. This small amount of floating capital, after being concentrated by life insurance companies, becomes huge capital, which is used to support the development of the national economy, promote national construction, and maintain government finances. Its power is very great. One-fourth of the capital of the national railways in the United States is supplied by life insurance companies. Other such as public debt rolls, industrial loans, and industrial shares also occupy a large part. During the European War, British and American life insurance companies raised as much as 200 million yuan in government war bonds. The benefits of life insurance to the country can be seen.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief description of the obvious effects of life insurance. It is so great and beneficial to individuals, society, and the country. No wonder that in recent times, those who peep into the rise and fall of a country often use the amount of life insurance insured by its people as a measure. May our people pay attention quickly, then the future of the nation may have something to do with it.</p>
<h3>Development of Life Insurance</h3>
<p>— Xiang Xinwu</p>
<p>Life insurance is extremely developed in developed countries in Europe and America. The great contribution to social stability and national economy need not be reiterated. In our country, although it also has a history of several decades and the efforts of some people, it is like a newly sprouted flower, waiting to be nurtured. I have always studied life insurance, and I think that the development of this undertaking has three basic points: one is the supervision of national laws; one is the soundness of the organization of the undertaking; and one is the popularization of life insurance knowledge. And the three are indispensable! If national laws are not promulgated, the undertaking will lose its basis; if the organization of the undertaking is not good, the promotion will be difficult to be smooth; if life insurance knowledge is not widespread, the need will not arise. Recently, the government's insurance industry law is about to be implemented, and the insurance law has also been promulgated; the operation of life insurance is still progressing and gradually becoming reasonable; and the life insurance special issue, which bears the heavy responsibility of spreading life insurance knowledge, has been published. The life insurance undertaking seems to be able to enter the stage from flower to fruit because of it. At this time, we should be overjoyed. How can the people of our country recognize the economic donation of personal death, and then have faith in life insurance, and then take responsibility for those who suffer losses? Putting pen to paper, I can't help but pin my infinite enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Most of us rely on our daily income for a living. If we suffer an accident, our wives and children will lose their livelihood. If we want to seek salvation, it is only life insurance. Life insurance does not guarantee that we can live forever, but it compensates for the economic losses caused by our own reasons. — Ma Yinchu</p>
<h3>History of the Development of Modern Life Insurance</h3>
<p>— Guo Yudong</p>
<p>The establishment of modern life insurance was after the establishment of the scientific basis of the death table, so if we want to study its history of development, we cannot but briefly explain the production of the death table.</p>
<p>The production of the death table began with Dmltius, a Roman jurist in ancient times, but the material is vague, and it is impossible to examine whether it is correct. Until the middle of the 17th century, the two major mathematicians, Rierd de Fermat and Blaise pascal of France, jointly published the Doctrine of Probabilities in 1654, the world began to know that the movement of human survival and death can be expressed in numbers. Secondly, at the end of the same century, Dr. Caspar Neumann, a religious figure in Germany, not only sorted out 15,869 death registrations in Breslau and Suesia from 1687 to 1691 by age and gender with great enthusiasm and amazing patience, but also investigated in detail those who were born in the same year and compared them with each other, and the basic material of the death table was thus formed. This material was sent by Neumann to Edmmud Halley, a great astronomer in England, for correction, and was highly appreciated by Halley. Therefore, Halley used this as a basis to publish The Morlrtality of Breslau in 1693, which was the beginning of the death table. The so-called modern life insurance is based on this. The following is a description of each country separately:</p>
<p>1. England England is the ancestor of life insurance. In 1698, the Meroers Company was established in London. The following year, The Society of Aidows and Orphans was established. However, after a short period of time, they all went bankrupt one after another, which was the earliest sacrifice of life insurance in England. Next, in 1706, according to the proposal of John Hartey, the AmicableSociety for a Pcrpetual Assurance was established. It was a mutual organization. The initial number of members was limited to 3,000, the insurance money was 100 pounds, and the annual premium was 6 pounds and 4 shillings. However, it was also dissolved due to lack of scientific knowledge. After that, in 1721, with the special permission of the Parliament, the two insurance companies, Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation and Assuranec Coporation, were produced. Speaking of the history of issuing life insurance policies, the above two companies should be the earliest. However, the first to start operating death insurance using a death table with a basis was The Society for the Equltable Assurance on Lives and Survivorships, which was founded in 1762. In other words, it is the ancestor of modern life insurance. This insurance company is a mutual organization, and most of the employees are highly educated upper-class people. Emphasis on quality rather than quantity is a consistent policy in its development process. It has been operating for more than 170 years and is still solid as ever. It occupies the most glorious history in the life insurance industry. The so-called Old Equitable is this company.</p>
<p>After the success of the Equitable Insurance Company, the foundation of life insurance in England was created by this. The number of companies that were established successively by 1933 was more than 70, and the total amount of insurance money, only in the UK, had reached 2,857.43 million pounds, ranking second in the world only after the United States.</p>
<p>2. The United States The United States is the base camp of life insurance. The amount of insurance money accounts for two-thirds of the world, and of course, its status is second to none. As for its history of development, the first operators started with the agencies of British life insurance companies. Later, in 17159, the Presbltarian Ministers Fund was established; in 1769, the EpiscopalianMinisters Fund was established. Both are mutual organizations, and the qualifications for joining are limited to pastors, and there is no benefit to the general public. The New England MutualLife Insuranc Company, which was established in 1835 with the permission of the Massachusetts State, was established to meet the needs of the general public. This company was organized in imitation of the British Equitable Insurance Company, and the fund was 100,000 US dollars. Secondly, the General Eiie and tiust Company, which was licensed by Pennsylvania in 1836, is a joint-stock company that independently operates life insurance in the United States, and it has become the two major fortresses of life insurance in the United States with mutual organizations. After the establishment of the Mutual Life of New york in 1842, life insurance in the United States developed vigorously and unhindered. According to the statistics of 1934, the total amount of insurance money has reached more than 98.5 billion US dollars; the total amount of assets has exceeded 21.8 billion US dollars; the total annual surplus is more than 2.2 billion, and its grand situation can be imagined.

<h3>Life Insurance and the New Life Movement</h3>
<p>— Guan Keguai</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement, New Life Movement branches have been established in provinces, cities, and counties across the country. As the movement has been promoted, the decadent atmosphere has undergone a transformation. To save the nation from disaster and revive the nation, promoting the New Life Movement is a fundamental and urgent matter. The New Life Movement takes the old virtues of our country over thousands of years, namely, the four principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, as its backbone, incorporates them into the New Life Covenant, and expresses them in daily actions, so that people can easily follow and practice them at any time. Human life has no inherent distinction between new and old. As long as one can diligently work hard and adapt to the current environment, it is new. The old virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame in our country are often regarded by people as clichés or mere ornaments, and they cannot be implemented in daily life, which is most regrettable. The New Life Movement aims to fully promote these inherent virtues, creating a disciplined, orderly, systematic, and planned personal life, and extending it to the relationships between people, thereby creating a disciplined, orderly, systematic, and planned social life. Therefore, the meaning of the New Life Movement is to promote and develop the original virtues of our nation, creating outstanding citizens and an outstanding nation suitable for survival in the current environment.</p>
<p>Regarding how to promote the New Life Movement and what kind of life activities should be the object of the New Life Movement, there are corresponding regulations in the New Life Covenant. Observing the organizational outline of the New Life Movement Labor Service Corps promulgated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, it has been stipulated in Article 15 as 'Promoting savings and insurance movement'. It can be known that 'insurance' is an important object in the New Life Movement, which is undoubtedly true. Among the insurance movements, 'life insurance' is the basic element of personal new life movement. The great German economist Engels studied the life problems of people in various European countries for twenty years. The research results show that 'life insurance' is a major element in the standard life of people in various European countries. The following is a record of Engels' research on the percentage distribution table of average personal living expenses of people in various European countries as proof:</p>
<p>The above table is a study of personal living expenses, so the item referred to as insurance premiums naturally refers to life insurance. From this, it can be seen that the average personal living expenses of Europeans include the same amount for life insurance premiums and medical expenses, which is more than double the amount for transportation expenses. Life insurance premiums account for one of the eight major living expenses of Europeans. The importance of the position of life insurance in the standard personal life can be imagined.</p>
<p>Now, I will briefly explain the functions of life insurance in promoting the propriety, righteousness, integrity, and sense of shame advocated by our country's New Life Movement.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, 'Only when clothing and food are sufficient can one know honor and disgrace.' It is rare for those who lack clothing and food to know honor and disgrace and abide by etiquette. How to maintain sufficient clothing and food at present is an important issue that needs to be resolved urgently by most people. However, even if clothing and food can be maintained at present, if one cannot prepare for a rainy day and plan ahead, once danger comes, clothing and food will be lost, and one will lose integrity and disregard etiquette, which is also a common occurrence. Life insurance is a guarantee to maintain sufficient clothing and food for individuals in the future, and also a guarantee to maintain personal integrity and etiquette throughout one's life. This is the function of life insurance in promoting 'propriety' as advocated by the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Who can avoid disease, old age, death, and unexpected events? As the head of a family, being able to purchase life insurance when productive capacity is strong, so that those who are supported will not be distressed and helpless, lose schooling and care due to the above-mentioned dangers, this is the 'righteousness' that an individual fulfills to the family. Because of purchasing life insurance, being prepared for emergencies, being able to help each other in times of need, and helping the poor, this is the 'righteousness' that an individual fulfills to friends. Purchasing group life insurance for employees, so that employees can work with peace of mind, not having the idea of seeing something different and wanting to move, eliminating labor disputes, and promoting social harmony, this is the 'righteousness' that administrators fulfill to society. Life insurance can achieve all these righteous deeds. This is the function of life insurance in promoting 'righteousness' as advocated by the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>"Great wealth comes from heaven, small wealth comes from thrift." Life insurance does not necessarily require wealthy people to purchase it, but it values the ability of salaried classes with meager incomes to handle their income with integrity and thrift, allocating a considerable percentage for purchase. The money accumulated through this integrity and thrift, accumulated from small drops, will, at a considerable period, be like accumulating soil into a mountain, forming a huge sum of money. Even if one is not wealthy, one should be able to live a decent life. Even if one unfortunately dies midway, one's family can also obtain this huge sum of money to use for various undertakings. Therefore, life insurance is more effective and provides more guarantees than the method of integrity and thrift savings. This is the function of life insurance in promoting "integrity" as advocated by the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Nothing is more shameful than not being able to be independent and relying on others, and nothing is more shameful than not being able to plan for oneself and one's family, so that oneself and one's family will beg for pity from others in the future. If one can think of times of need in times of abundance and purchase life insurance in advance as a guarantee, then why should one suffer the shame of begging for pity and relying on others? This is the function of life insurance in promoting knowing 'shame' and avoiding 'shame' as advocated by the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>What the New Life Movement advocates is to take the four principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame as the backbone, and life insurance has the function of promoting the four principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Therefore, those who practice the New Life Movement must recognize life insurance and pay attention to life insurance!</p>
<h3>Taking in a Beggar Leads to a Wolf in the House: A Huge Sum of Money is Stolen from the Gold Exchange and Wasted</h3>
<p>Madam Gao Gu is Moody and Regrets it Too Late; Gu Xingfu is Penniless and Looks Like a Beggar</p>
<p>Madam Gao Gu, a local woman residing at No. 15, Lane 384, Qipu Road, is 58 years old. She owns a considerable amount of property left by her late husband. However, she has a history of nervous disorders, which has been exploited by her relatives. A man named Gu Xingfu, 21 years old, claiming to be Madam Gao Gu's younger brother, was raised by her since his parents passed away. Around April of this year, Gu Xingfu suddenly stole two savings passbooks from his sister's Four Banks Savings Association, one for a fixed deposit of 2,000 yuan and one for a current deposit of 500 yuan. He secretly fled with them. He withdrew all the 500 yuan from the current deposit and managed to pawn the 2,000 yuan fixed deposit for 1,800 yuan.</p>
<p>He squandered the money on prostitutes and wanton spending. Within a few months, he had used it all up. His clothes became tattered, and he looked like a beggar. One day, he returned home, fearing his sister's condemnation. As the sun set, he had no way to think of a solution. So, he surrendered himself to the Huisi Police Station a few days ago. After investigation by Chinese detective Fang Qingyun, Gu Xingfu confessed that after stealing the passbooks, he discussed it with Liu Jimin, who lived at No. 25, Jua'an Lane, Xiangshan Road, Zhabei.</p>
<p>Liu worked as a clerk at Watson's Pharmacy and was a former neighbor of his, so they knew each other. Liu helped him pawn the 2,000 yuan fixed deposit for 1,800 yuan. Then, they opened a room on the third floor of the New World Hotel to discuss the distribution of the money. Besides Gu himself and Liu Jimin, there were also Madam Gao Gu's daughter</p>
<p>and son-in-law Shi Rong, making a total of four people. As a result, Gu got 800 yuan, Shi got 500 yuan, and Liu also got 800 yuan. The remaining 200 yuan was covered by a promissory note issued by Liu. Liu still lives in Zhabei, and Shi has returned to Ningbo. The Chinese detective went to Zhabei and arrested Liu. Gu and Liu were sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court the day before yesterday. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the police station,</p>
<p>filed a lawsuit according to the law. According to Madam Gao Gu's complaint about the theft, Gu Xingfu is not my younger brother. He was a beggar since he was a child and often begged at my house. I took him in and raised him. Little did I know that I was bringing a wolf into the house and raising a snake in my bosom. When questioned, Gu Xingfu admitted to stealing the passbooks and sharing the money with Liu and Shi. However, this idea was also initiated by Liu. When questioned, Liu Jimin,</p>
<p>denied conspiring to share the money, saying that he saw Gu's luxurious clothes and lavish behavior and issued a promissory note to borrow 200 yuan from Gu, which he had returned and retrieved the promissory note. He then presented the promissory note to the court. After Judge Pan verified the confession, he ordered the two defendants to be detained and await another hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Sent to Zhenru for Autopsy</p>
<p>Sun Quan, 26 years old from Wuxi, runs a blacksmith shop at No. 81, Dapu Road, Shanghai South. Yesterday afternoon, for some unknown reason, he beat his apprentice Yao Jincai, 14 years old from Yixing, to death. After receiving the news, the police station in charge took Sun, along with the deceased's father, Yao Jinbao, 50 years old, to the station for interrogation. The local guarantor was notified to report to the local court to appoint a prosecutor to visit the scene. It was verified that Yao Jincai had bruises on his face and legs. However, a purplish-black color was found on his lips, possibly indicating internal poisoning. The guarantor was instructed to carry the body to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for a detailed autopsy to clarify the truth and facilitate legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>The Gold Exchange Held its Annual Shareholders Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Gold Exchange held its second annual shareholders meeting at the exchange's market yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Du Yuesheng.

<h3>Japanese Man, Kimura Koichi, Invents a New Method of Dendrobium Cultivation</h3>
<p>It is Said That it Can Overturn the Herbal Classic's Theory</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News, Dendrobium, which is drunk every morning by the famous Mei Lanfang for longevity and beautiful singing, has long been noted by plant scholars around the world. However, because the yield of this Dendrobium is not high and the value is high, and it grows naturally on the cliffs of deep mountains and is not easy to cultivate on flat ground, it is a precious medicinal herb in Chinese medicine. Kimura Koichi, a pharmacist at the Pharmaceutical Research Room of the Institute of Natural Sciences in this city, has been studying Dendrobium since 1931. He went to the original producing areas of Taiwan, Guangdong, and Guangxi to collect a large number of materials. After years of research, he has achieved a major breakthrough, that is, Dendrobium, which cannot be planted on flat ground, has now broken through the difficulties and can be cultivated anywhere. He has worked hard for three years to not only be able to cultivate on flat ground, but also to revive those that have withered and died and discovered about 150 new species. In addition, the original plants of Dendrobium medicinal materials are divided into more than 30 species, thus obtaining a complete picture of the Dendrobium medicinal material science. This great invention has completely overturned the established theories on Dendrobium and the original plants of Dendrobium medicinal material science recorded in the herbal classic. Currently, Kimura has sent his thesis to Tokyo and will publish it soon.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan Discusses Disaster Relief in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, Zhu Qinglan, chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing at 7:00 a.m. yesterday. According to him, his trip to Shanghai this time is to attend the meeting of the Shanghai Charity Organization Joint Disaster Relief Association. Regarding the recent urgent disaster relief in various provinces, such as the 300,000 yuan Henan public bond, the Henan Disaster Relief Association has sold it for 183,000 yuan in cash, together with the province's disaster relief reserve fund of 30,000 yuan and the Shanghai Disaster Relief Association's 10,000 yuan, totaling 223,000 yuan. All of them have been distributed to the counties with the most severe disasters by the joint supervisory commissioner Tang Zongguo, totaling 220,000 yuan. The remaining 3,000 yuan will be allocated to disaster relief orphanages in the three disaster areas of Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang to rescue orphaned children. The first disaster relief loan of 230,000 yuan in Guizhou was presented in person by Zhou Gongshen, chairman of the provincial disaster relief association, to request handling of Pingtiao in Nanjing, so that disaster relief can be provided continuously. The provincial supervisory commissioner Cheng Jingsheng also agreed, and the association presented the case to the court for approval. As for the second disaster relief loan of 100,000 yuan, it will be considered and relieved after Commissioner Cheng arrives in Guizhou for inspection. As for the 80,000 yuan of national currency for disaster relief in Xikang bandit areas, Supervisory Commissioner Shi Hongsan has sent personnel to various disaster-stricken counties to investigate and distribute. However, due to the inconvenience of transportation in the province, it may take two or three months to complete the work. In addition, disaster relief in Mazong Mountain in Qinghai and Ningxia is being investigated and distributed by Commissioner Du Shaopeng in the disaster areas.</p>

His wife, Xing, is the same age as Ji and has a good appearance. The couple has a good relationship. Ten days ago, Xing went to Puxi alone to shop. She was lost and cried on the way. A Yangzhou man, Wang Guiqing, happened to pass by and saw her. After questioning her about the situation, he volunteered to guide her and send her home. She was then taken to a hotel by Wang Guiqing, who used both hard and soft tactics to scare and deceive her. She was eventually raped for several days. The day before yesterday evening, he pretended to send her back to Pudong, but instead of going directly to her home in Yangjiadu, he walked northeast to the Changzhan Eighteenth Jian area. Since his wife disappeared, Ji abandoned his business and searched everywhere every day, almost like a madman. At that time, he happened to be searching in the Eighteenth Jian area and coincidentally saw his wife walking with Wang. He was angry and reported to the police, who took Xing and Wang to the local police station and transferred them to the Pudong Branch. During the interrogation, Wang still claimed that he saw Xing was pitiful at the time and rescued her, which led to a romantic relationship. The director immediately ordered them to be sent to the court for disposal.</p>

<h3>Dong Laizhou Opens a Brothel and Colludes with Relief Society to Claim Young Girls</h3>
<p>Intent to Turn Young Girls into Prostitutes, Fortunately Rescued After Lawyer Reported to Society</p>
<p>Zhou Xiuying, a girl from Nanxiang, 15 years old, was adopted by Chen Wang, a Cantonese woman on North Sichuan Road, on November 17th last year. Due to abuse, she was sent by the court to the Women and Children Relief Society for care. On January 12th of this year, Dong Laizhou, a Tongzhou native who lives at No. 558 Peng Road and runs a brothel, colluded with Lu Chen, a woman from Nanxiang, and the girl's fugitive maternal uncle, Chen Heshang, to take Xiuying out of the Women and Children Relief Society. She stayed at Dong's brothel. Because she was young and had never received guests, a lawyer found out and wrote to the Women and Children Relief Society to send inspector Du Yongfang to report to the Hongkou Police Station. Chinese detectives Chen Lianjing and Huang Yulin went to arrest Dong Laizhou and Chen Chen, and brought the girl Zhou Xiuying to the police station. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The girl was sent back to the Women and Children Relief Society. The other day, Judge Xiao Xieffen opened the Third Criminal Court for continued trial. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, stated that the date for cross-examination should be changed. He questioned Zhou, stating that Dong Laizhou was not her relative and Lu Chen was not her aunt. Taking the girl out was malicious and intended to turn Xiuying into a prostitute for profit, which was extremely despicable. He requested severe punishment. When questioned, the two defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Xiao ruled that Dong Laizhou and Lu Chen be sentenced to three years in prison as a warning.</p>

<h3>Thirty Million Cantonese People Face the Threat of Starvation</h3>
<p>— Jian Ping</p>
<p>With the problem of skyrocketing grain prices becoming increasingly serious, Guangdong, which relies on foreign rice and rice from other provinces, is inevitably experiencing a sudden and severe deterioration of its food situation, which was to be expected. However, precisely because of this, we cannot but pay close attention to this issue that affects the lives of people across the country. The "thirty million Cantonese people face the threat of starvation" is actually a prelude to the transformation of 450 million compatriots into starving ghosts.</p>
<p>Regarding the problem of skyrocketing grain prices, it is generally understood that hoarding by unscrupulous merchants and high-priced purchases by the enemy are the main reasons. However, using these general reasons to bypass the grain panic in Guangdong Province, although not unique, contains a great local phenomenon, which has its differences. In other words, the causes of the grain panic in Guangdong Province also have their local characteristics. I believe that those who have dabbled in writings on the grain issue in Guangdong Province, or who have been to Guangdong and lived there, may understand the source of grain supply in Guangdong Province. And what Guangdong Province lacks most is, of course, the main 'rice'. The figures for Guangdong Province's reliance on foreign rice and rice from other provinces are copied below:</p>
<p>"Since the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1912-1933), Guangdong Province has imported a total of over 179 million dan of foreign rice, with an average of over 8.1 million dan imported annually. As for the import of domestic rice from various provinces, the number is also considerable, with an average of over 2 million dan per year over the past 22 years, with Anhui rice accounting for half, and the rest being Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Hunan rice. According to this, the combined import of foreign and domestic rice averages about 10 million dan per year." (According to Guangzhou correspondence published in this newspaper on the 26th)</p>
<p>From this figure, we see the following phenomenon: Guangdong Province almost entirely relies on foreign rice imports: and foreign rice imports account for more than 80%. From this perspective, the grain panic in Guangdong Province has been a "22-year" affair, no, in fact, it can be said to have been going on for an unknown number of years; and, if the supply of foreign rice stops one day, '20 million Cantonese people' are 'in danger of starvation' at any time. However, we have been ignoring this issue, which contains such great severity, without paying the slightest attention, until now that the crisis has become a reality, and only then do we "call for help" and "provide relief," which is not without the harm of the "treating the head when it hurts" policy. However, "it is never too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost," and the fundamental cure for this problem is indeed what urgently needs to be discussed at present.</p>
<p>The severity of the current crisis can be manifested in the following: First, "even inferior brown rice costs more than six catties per yuan." Second, "famine riots of robbing rice have occurred in Nanhai, Gaoming, Shunde, and Sanshui (these four counties are all first-class counties)." Third, "even Zhongshan County, which is known as a model county, is eating bran and sweet potato due to the rice shortage." Fourth, in Guangzhou, there are "groups of three or five people, going from store to store begging for food, and even if the police are dispatched, they cannot handle it." Now let's talk about the most terrible scene—Guangzhou "has only over 3.93 million catties of rice in stock, which is only enough for a few days." Of course, in such a dangerous moment, urgently seeking relief is indeed a necessary thing. Therefore, the four proposed methods, such as: 1. Exempt foreign rice tax; 2. Stop rice merchants from hoarding; 3. Reduce grain transportation costs; 4. Reiterate the ban on the export of domestic rice. All are last resorts, especially the first one, which is a method of "cutting flesh to heal sores." At the same time. In today's situation where food is in a state of panic across the country, shipping rice from other provinces to Guangdong is by no means a foolproof method. The crux of the problem of not being able to be self-sufficient and self-supporting cannot be reversed by four passive methods. The situation is critical, how can we sit idly by and watch 20 million Cantonese people starve!</p>
<h3>Reflections After Watching "Living in a Drunken Dream"</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>Amateur Actors Perform at the Carlton</p>
<p>In terms of meaning, among the three programs performed by amateur actors this time, "Living in a Drunken Dream" is the most active. "The Demon of Desire" has too much of Tolstoy's flavor: "Thunderstorm" only exposes, although in this gloomy tragedy, there is also a Varvara who runs away with her lover: As for this "Living in a Drunken Dream," the Jia Lizhen here sees more than Nora, understands more, and leaves more clearly and correctly than Nora.</p>
<p>Therefore, if it is said that Nora's departure has only two paths, going home and becoming a prostitute, then Jia Lizhen should be outside these two paths. Her departure is no longer the concept of Nora, and what she is fighting for is no longer just for the so-called human rights. Her future should and must be more promising than Nora's.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is the limitation of the objective environment? It is a pity that, regarding Jia Lizhen's engagement in the aid-Sui movement, apart from telling us in the description, we did not even hear a single line on the stage. Although there is a line saying "the country must be loved," it is obviously not enough to give strength to Lizhen's later departure: I don't know Okse's original work, nor have I seen the adapted script, but based on the brief description, I dare to believe that the existence of Jia Lizhen's character must be written as "the country must be loved" on the one hand, and on the other hand, in her daily life, she is like other petty-bourgeois daughters, she cannot do without love, and she spends most of her energy on love. When the dream of love is shattered, she realizes that even Ji Dewen, who pursues her every step of the way, will turn away after knowing that she has been deceived and is pregnant. Therefore, she realizes that these problems are by no means her own personal problems, so she resolutely leaves and embarks on her new path.</p>
<p>In the original script, the patriotic part of Jia Lizhen may not have been much, but what we see now is really too little, so little that Jia Lizhen's subsequent awakening becomes sudden. Is this the director's negligence or the limitation of the objective environment? From the fact that there is the word "aid-Sui" in the description but no lines are seen, the latter reason may exceed the former.</p>
<p>It is gratifying to digest world-famous plays and adapt them to suit national conditions. "Living in a Drunken Dream" connects the current aid-Sui issue, and this effort is naturally even more admirable. In addition to the aforementioned Jia Lizhen, the insertion of the 'traitor' Jia Jiangnan who betrayed his friends, in principle, can of course exist and should exist, but, as we see it now, such a character as Jia Jiangnan is really too obscure (the reason for his terror is only explained in the third act, which is too late). In the tone of the play, the insertion of such a character as Jia Jiangnan seems to be hindered quite a bit in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Such a character as Jia Jiangnan is not very harmonious with the tone of "Living in a Drunken Dream" (another example is the insertion of Mrs. Li). I think the problem with the director's technique is not unrelated. The director here seems to be too focused on jokes, so that when Mrs. Li comes on stage or Jia Jiangnan screams in terror from the room, the atmosphere of the play suddenly changes. Because of the suddenness, the feeling is somewhat unnatural.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is the issue of character portrayal. In "Living in a Drunken Dream," the character portrayal is very profound, and each person's personality is very obvious, but although the playwright has put white powder on their noses, the satire is still not deep enough. Once the satirical power of the play is weak, the impression given to the audience will also lose some of the expected effect.</p>
<p>Regarding the stage design, it is very beautiful here, just like the other two plays, but in my opinion, I think it is enough to build an indoor set. The roof can be omitted, and the treetops outside can be omitted. As it is now, the scenery outside is not of any special use, and when the door is opened, the shadow of the door is reflected on the sky curtain outside, which is also not very pleasant, so why not simply omit it? If it is said that it is to show the change of time, then even indoors, it can be changed with lighting.</p>
<p>Regarding the actors' acting skills, Gu Eryi and Shi Chao are both extremely good. Li Lin's role is very heavy, but here she has managed to do it with ease. Zhao Dan's acting is calm and experienced, but he still cannot be seen as a villain who deceives women's chastity: Li Qing, who plays Jia Jiangnan, and Lan Ping, who plays Mrs. Li, are good in acting, but because they are not in harmony with the tone of the play, they somewhat affect the impression given to the audience. Zhang Ke and Wu Mei work hard and are generally very responsible.</p>
<p>Regarding the effect, it cannot be considered bad, but I think the slogans of the crowd are not heroic enough. Perhaps it is because there are too few people shouting backstage, otherwise, the threat to the person who betrayed his friends would definitely be greater.</p>
<h3>Wu Mei and Li Lin Play Mother and Daughter Separately</h3>
<h3>Patriotic Noble Lady</h3>
<p>— Mu Yi</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, the ballroom of the Grand Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road was packed with distinguished guests from all walks of life. It turned out that a certain gentleman was holding a social dance party there.</p>
<p>Among the guests, there was a noble lady who attracted the most attention, because she was not only beautifully dressed, beautiful in appearance, and moved in rhythm, but especially her hair, which was black and bright, and exuded bursts of subtle fragrance from her hairline, which entered other people's nostrils and attracted their attention.</p>
<p>Those who don't know always think that the hair lotion she uses is a high-end foreign product, so that it can make her hair so black and so fragrant. In fact, the fragrant hair lotion she uses is the domestic "131 Hair Lotion," so she can truly be called a 'patriotic noble lady'. (Note: 131 Hair Lotion is a product of Wuzhou Rongfang.)</p>
<h3>Different Joys and Sorrows</h3>
<p>— Fang Lin</p>
<p>The families of Mr. Jia and Mr. Yi live on the same street, but their families have different joys and sorrows.</p>
<p>The family of Mr. Yi is filled with a gloomy atmosphere. The adults and children are often sick. Neighbors often hear the moans in their house, and others often see the sad faces of their family members, because they do not pay attention to hygiene, and take ineffective medicines for their illnesses, causing the illnesses to drag on, so this gloomy phenomenon is created.</p>
<p>The family of Mr. Jia is the opposite of Mr. Yi's. Their house is filled with a happy atmosphere. The adults and children are all healthy. Neighbors often hear the laughter and joy in their house. ... Because their family usually uses sanitary products from Wuzhou Pharmacy, they rarely get sick. If they do get sick, they must use the good medicine prepared by Wuzhou, so that a major illness becomes a minor illness, and a minor illness becomes no illness.</p>
<h3>Wind and Cloud</h3>
<p>— Liu Wang</p>
<p>Wind</p>
<p>There, in the distant hometown, whenever the setting sun lingered on the treetops of the sparse forest, on the narrow ancient road, there would be an elderly woman gazing towards the end of the road.</p>
<p>The woman was really too old. Her rickety appearance and slow steps proved that she had lived in this world for an infinitely long time. The arduous burden was beyond her ability to bear. For the sake of her husband, her children, and even every ruthless oppressor, she was finally bent over by many heavy burdens. Her unhealthy little feet, although weakened by the long white cloth that wrapped them when she was young, still helped a lot and replaced a lot of hard work when her husband was busy with farming. Now, all the strength of the past has disappeared, and she walks with a limp. If it weren't for the support of that cane, perhaps she would accidentally lose her footing and fall to the ground, never to be able to get up again.</p>
<p>The evening wind blew harder. It blew through the sparse forest, urging down the withered yellow leaves: it also blew through the old woman's temples, making the silver-white strands of hair all messed up. She raised her withered hand, slightly tidied her scattered hair, and moved forward a few steps with the cane. Her lifeless eyes gazed vaguely into the distance, where she deposited a hope, a warmth. She looked towards the other side of the distant road, where a young man would come. This young man was none other than her son, whom she had been thinking about day and night for several years.</p>
<p>Every evening, she always came with a cane, full of great hope, but always went home in disappointment in the twilight. No one understood her grief and compassion, and no one comforted her. Life withered and dried up in expectation.</p>
<p>The evening wind blew her silver hair, and when she used her withered hand to comb it again, all the white hair that was about to fall out had already fallen.</p>
<p>Cloud</p>
<p>"Floating clouds, a traveler's heart; setting sun, an old friend's feeling!" Every time a wanderer on the horizon reads these poignant lines that describe it so vividly, they can't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>Naturally, clouds are heartless things, they neither</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>have their own emotions, nor can they convey emotions for people. However, wanderers, after all, can hardly resist their sorrow towards them, which is naturally just the sustenance of people's emotions: however, the clouds are enough to symbolize the wanderers, and they are really too similar.</p>
<p>Floating clouds have no feet, so they have no fixed place of residence: they are just arbitrarily blown there by the pushing of the heavenly wind. And floating clouds are still fickle, they can become heroes, they can also become butterflies, and finally, perhaps everything will be completely scattered. This is just like the wanderer's unsettled whereabouts, drifting everywhere, living everywhere. Joy, sorrow, comfort, worry, all kinds of emotions are intertwined in the chest, but they turn into indifference.</p>
<p>When there is nothing to do, or when suffering from worries, one often stands in an open place, gazing sadly at the white clouds in the west, and often easily thinks of one's hometown. The fluttering white clouds are moving slowly, and this posture reminds people of the white-haired old mother's heavy steps. Perhaps at this time, the old mother is on the ridge, looking at the end of the road, waiting for the wanderer to return? And the deeper memory is those flocks of sheep on the grassland under the white clouds. When I was a child, I often grazed there, lying on the grassland and looking up at the floating clouds in the sky. There were many heroic ambitions and hopes entrusted in the depths of the white clouds. What about now? Nothing has been achieved, sadly gazing at the fluttering floating clouds, there is only a full of shame, and the longing for the old mother in my hometown!</p>
<h3>Boat</h3>
<p>— Shen Bing</p>
<p>The boat carries the wind, carries the waves. The boat and the wind and the waves are rubbing against each other. Being grabbed, thrown, and stumbling as if unable to stand firm. The wind splits the boat, and the sea is trembling. The boat has also become a useless and clumsy person, like the Weakwater bird that cannot keep up with the battle of life, and the clumsy penguin, poetic feelings, and book meanings also hinder the scenery of the sea storm.</p>
<p>The boat is thrown into despair, and only sees a world of huge expanses of seawater.</p>
<p>The young boatmen hold the rudder, strangle the cable, and the sails kiss the dark water, like white butterflies flying towards black butterflies. The foam splashes higher than the ship's rafters, wetting their heads, wetting their chests, until the sails kiss the dark water, and the boat sways as if it has been knocked down, lying on the bed of the sea, and the young boatmen hold the rudder.</p>
<p>But as soon as the mast tilts, the boat struggles again. The boat body is dripping with water, as if it cannot bear the fatigue. The boat looks up and rushes into the sea, being splashed and played with by the seawater, tilting its body, with its head up and down in the fierce battle. Wind, waves, rise, fall, up and down, the sea journey is infinitely far. The boat is in despair, and only sees a world of full waves.</p>
<p>The boat stands upright with its mast, the sails are up again, and there are no longer storms and evil waves on the sea. The boat has created a peaceful and uniform speed. The seawater drags over the side of the boat like the embroidered edge of a skirt and flows backwards. The boat does not sail out of an eternal circle, from day to night, and from night to day.</p>
<p>Who is it, propping up their chin and listening? People are talking on the mast, and the boatmen are asking about the rain and the stars.</p>

<h3>Ballad Singing</h3>
<p>Yang Binkui and Yang Zhenxiong's "Jade Kui Dragon"</p>
<p>Yuanchang (1120) from 11:15 AM to 11:30 AM</p>
<p>Opening piece: "Suzhou Scenery" (Mimi Collection Inaugural Issue)</p>
<p>Gusu (Suzhou) is originally a walled city. Its customs and scenery are famous for their tranquility and elegance. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter make up the four seasons. The auspicious times and beautiful scenery are most pleasant. Golden-bridled horses. Oiled green carriages. Also, there are Mi Fu's boats and calligraphy treasures that are exceptionally refined. Those coming and going are all famous figures. Elegant anecdotes have been passed down through the ages. In spring, tour Dengwei Mountain to pick plum blossoms. The fragrant snow sea is evidence of past causes. On the thirteenth of the third month, there is a Pipa (lute) gathering. Red-clad men and green-clad women are crowded together. Zhixing Mountain villas have poetic encounters. The most wondrous sight is the Fan family tomb with its myriad pointed peaks facing the sky. In the scorching heat of summer, it is best to set out from Fengmen in a small boat. The lotus pond is secluded, and its poverty is accompanied by a delicate fragrance. In the evening, take a refreshing rain shower. Walking barefoot back home, the joy is doubled. The autumn breeze easily ages the autumn scenery. The fragrance of osmanthus flowers permeates a round of bright moon. Suddenly, the pearly throat opens, and the melodious singing is like boiling. Stone Lake's Shen Yue Lake boats sail. After touring all eighteen scenes of Misty Cliff, look up and see a curtain of green. It is said that there is a restaurant that simmers bass fish soup in the ditch. Since Yu Youren wrote poetry on the wall, the Jiangnan (regions south of the Yangtze River) flavor has nourished the perch. After autumn has passed, the late autumn arrives again. It is precisely the time when the maple leaves of Tianping Mountain are drunk with frost. Ten thousand branches and a thousand reds are delicately dripping. It is better than watching flowers in the second month of spring. Sometimes, one ascends Tiger Hill to admire the snow. Leaning on the curved railings of the Cold Fragrance Pavilion, one sees a vast expanse of white without Wei Zifu turning back to look. One only feels that the glistening sea of silver is pure and without dust. Occasionally, a guest boat moors at Maple Bridge. The hidden sound of the Cold Mountain Temple's bell is faintly heard. Zhang Ji's poetic soul brings people clarity in their dreams. Count the good scenery of the year from the beginning. I urge you not to waste this time. Make the effort to display the wax in advance as the year-end approaches.</p>
<p>Cao Xiaoying's "Jade Dragonfly"</p>
<p>Zhongxi (1040) from 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening piece: "National Flower"</p>
<p>Although the plum blossom is not the king of flowers. Its character is noble and stands out from the crowd. Since ancient times, poets have praised and determined it. It is honored as the champion of flowers and is unparalleled in the world. The chrysanthemum is the hermit among flowers. The lotus is also considered a gentleman. Zhou Dunyi loved the lotus, and Tao Yuanming loved the chrysanthemum. The interests of the two are very different. Do you know, the plum blossom combines reclusiveness and gentlemanship. Its nature is gentle, its character is noble, and its appearance is dignified. People in the world mostly praise the peach and plum blossoms. The peach blossom is charming, and the plum blossom is fragrant. The plum blossom only finds peace in constancy. It does not want to follow the trend and learn new makeup. It is elegant and refined and has no vulgar air. It is ashamed to compete with the peach and plum blossoms for fragrance. Without a good matchmaker, what harm is there? The fairy of Miaogu Mountain originally had no lover. Its mountain friends are pine and bamboo. The night breeze is clear, and the moon and frost are its companions. Common flowers should only listen to orders. Who is enough to be the first to herald the spring light? Therefore, it is said that when the new moon unfolds its eyebrows, the stars are mixed. When the old plum blossoms bloom, a hundred flowers are busy. Who knows who its confidant is when the sky is desolate and the earth is old? It is only said that the eyes of the world are blind. Unexpectedly, the amorous spirit also includes Lin Hejing. To find a kindred spirit, one must speak of Meng Xiangyang. Now, the determination of the national flower is even more glorious.</p>

How do they weep, sob, and choke with sobs? The cuckoos wail. How is it so desolate? It is the Qingming Festival. The weather is not clear. Light smoke curls up. Sparse rain drizzles. It leads people to let their tears flow, gently and meltingly. Alas, life is like a dream. A dream is like smoke. Smoke is like rain, rain and tears. Together they drip, drop by drop, mourning Qingming. The intestines and soul are broken. The sound stops, but the tears don't stop.</p>

<h3>American Film Magazine Selects Top Ten Films</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In the recently published American Photoplay, ten films were specially put forward to select the best film of 1936, and readers were asked to vote autonomously to reject them. The film magazine has held a film election every year since 1902, and this year is the sixteenth time. After the best film of each year is selected, the film magazine will award a gold medal. Among these selected films, Norma Shearer has the most, such as "The Divorcee" in 1932 and "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" in 1934, both of which she starred in. In 1929, it was "The Divine Lady", starring Corinne Griffith; in 1930, it was "All Quiet on the Western Front", produced by Universal; in 1931, it was "Cimarron", produced by RKO; in 1933, it was "Little Women", starring Katharine Hepburn; in 1935, it was "Naughty Marietta", produced by MGM, starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. What about 1936? We dare not predict now, but the publication specifically recommends "The Petrified Forest", which is based on the original work of Eugene O'Neill, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1936. The top ten films recommended by the publication are introduced as follows:</p>
<p>"The Petrified Forest" produced by MGM, starring Leslie Howard and Bette Davis.</p>
<p>"Dodsworth" produced by Walter Wanger, directed by William Wyler, starring Walter Huston and Ruth Chatterton.</p>
<p>"A Tale of Two Cities" produced by MGM, directed by Jack Conway, based on the original work by Charles Dickens, starring Ronald Colman.</p>
<p>"The Great Ziegfeld" starring William Powell and Myrna Loy. (This film broke the American film industry's box office record, screening for a total of twenty-two weeks)</p>
<p>"Libeled Lady" produced by MGM, starring Myrna Loy, William Powell, and Jean Harlow. (Released in the United States in December of last year, it was soon shipped to China)</p>
<p>"Modern Times" produced by United Artists, written and directed by Charlie Chaplin, co-starring with Paulette Goddard.</p>
<p>"Anthony Adverse" produced by First National, starring Fredric March.</p>
<p>"The Story of Louis Pasteur" produced by Warner Bros., starring Paul Muni.</p>
<p>"Nine Days a Queen" produced by Gaumont British, starring Cedric Hardwicke and Nova Pilbeam.</p>
<p>"Ramona" produced by Twentieth Century Fox, directed by Henry King, starring Loretta Young, a full color film.</p>
<h3>Short Shots of "Wealth and Glory"</h3>
<p>Parents all hope that their children will be promoted to high positions and become wealthy in the future, so the names they choose mostly carry some auspiciousness. Although Ge Furong and Weng Shirong are servants who raise dogs in people's homes, their names are "Wealth" and "Glory" respectively.</p>
<p>Although people are poor, fate is not. The two poor fools unintentionally won the aviation first prize, realizing their names "Wealth and Glory."</p>
<p>The two poor fools who won the aviation first prize used the huge sum of money to support Suiyuan, fools who know how to love their country, fools who are willing to love their country, are really shaming ordinary traitors and misers!</p>
<h3>Visiting the Rehearsal of "Sunrise"</h3>
<p>Ever since watching "Thunderstorm" on the stage, I have developed a deep admiration and liking for the playwright Cao Yu. His vivid and sharp writing portrays all aspects of real life ruthlessly. "Thunderstorm" is not only a success for the author's personal artistic creation, but also casts a rising torch for China's long-silent drama scene.</p>
<p>After the author's second masterpiece "Sunrise" was successively published in the Wun Ji Monthly, it not only aroused the attention of the audience who loved "Thunderstorm", but also our literary and drama circles have paid considerable attention to it. Famous writers such as Ba Jin, Mao Dun, Ye Shengtao... etc., have all expressed serious opinions on "Sunrise", and it is generally recognized as a more successful work than "Thunderstorm", a glorious harvest in the drama works of 1936.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I got the news that the "Drama Workshop" will prepare for the rehearsal, which is a very good news. Recently, I heard that it will be staged soon, and this desire also has the possibility of being realized.</p>
<p>It was a late night the day before yesterday. Due to a friend's appointment, I specially went to the club to visit their rehearsal of "Sunrise". As soon as I walked in, I felt a kind of tense atmosphere flowing. Men and women filled the entire room, and everyone was earnestly working on their work. Director Ouyang Yuqian was fully focused on the actors' movements and lines. Under his guidance, all the actors exerted their performing talents. Part of the actors are old members of the "Fudan Drama Club". Their past efforts are beyond introduction, and they are quite experienced in stage performance. This time, "Sunrise" will be excellent under their joint hard work.</p>
<p>I also visited their set. They are all half-section style, novel and unique, never seen before. The designers of this set are Yu Yeyu and Chu Yingyao.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the club, they decided that the date of the premiere is: February 2, the location is the Carlton Grand Theater in this city, and the performance dates in Shanghai are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th for three days.</p>
<p>They are all busy, so it's not convenient to disturb them too much. Fortunately, the day of meeting is not far away. Audiences who are eager for "Sunrise", wait!</p>
<h3>A Scene from "Get Rich Quick"</h3>
<h3>Huaan Broadcasting</h3>
<p>Sun Yu's "Spring Returns to the World" has few remaining shots, and he is now working hard on editing and dubbing.</p>
<p>Shen Fu's new film "A Match Made in Heaven", starring Han Langen, Bai Lu, Liu Jiqun, and Yin Xiucen, has been completed and will be released soon.</p>
<p>Zhu Shilin's new work "The Lost Pearl in the Sea of People" is now actively preparing to start filming. Although Zhu Shilin has been unwell several times, he has been able to overcome his illness and work diligently, never stopping. He also wants to break the shortest record for the production of "The Lost Pearl in the Sea of People". His spirit of hard work in art is worthy of much praise. The film stars many big stars such as Li Lili, Li Qing, Liu Qiong, Han Langen, Hong Jingling, and Yin Xiucen.</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng's "Wang Lao Wu" script has been written and sent to Beijing for review. As soon as it is approved, filming will begin immediately.</p>
<p>Tan Youliu's latest script, named "Mysterious Shanghai", is under review.</p>
<p>The General Factory's Actor Recruitment Committee has selected new actors with skills such as Ouyang Hongying, Ning Xuan, Zhang Wan, and Xia Xia, who have now joined the work, and the rest are still being selected one after another.</p>
<p>"The Lost Pearl in the Sea of People" has been approved by the Central Film Inspection Committee. In the film, Li Zhuozhuo plays an unfortunate abandoned woman, but she wants to be a progressive new woman, wants to not rely on men, work hard and support herself, and raise her daughter. But in this society, she is not allowed to do so, which leads to a very painful tragedy.</p>
<p>Li Lili plays a tour guide in "The Lost Pearl in the Sea of People". She is controlled by money and power, follows the crowd, and lives a subhuman life while bearing humiliation. This is the first time Lili has played this kind of role.</p>
<p>Director Fei Mu has obtained a new subject script after "The Bloody Battle of Wolf Mountain", and the name has not yet been determined.</p>
