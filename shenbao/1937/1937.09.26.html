<h3>敵四次援軍開到企圖大舉來犯我决痛擊</h3>
<p>羅店劉行我軍有相當進展　江灣閘北砲戰外僅小接觸　我空軍夜襲猛轟敵軍陣地</p>
<p>滬戰全線、昨日頗爲沉寂、羅店劉行江灣閘北砲戰之外、僅局部前哨之小接觸而已、敵軍已承認遭逢我軍意外堅强之抵抗、故在援軍開到增加補充之前、尚不敢企圖進犯、敵軍第四次增援之四萬部隊、昨晨又有五千抵滬、合計已有二萬人左右登陸、料敵援軍全部開到、恐將大舉進犯、但我軍守衛堅强、有備無患、屆時自當迎頭痛擊、而空前大戰、當在下週以內、昨夜今晨、我空軍兩度飛襲楊樹浦敵陣地、猛烈轟炸、敵驚惶無措、已受巨損、</p>
<h3>我空軍兩度夜襲敵陣地</h3>
<p>轟炸奏功安然飛返</p>
<p>昨夜十時五十五分、我方空軍、又翱翔於浦江敵艦及滬東一帶敵軍陣地上空施行轟炸、機聲由北向南、敵艦上之探海燈及紅色信號立時飛舞空際、而高射砲與機關槍聲亦自北迤南、約歷二十分鐘之久、機聲漸遠、敵方之高射砲聲亦旋吿停止、</p>
<p>今晨一時十七分、我大隊空軍又繼續作第二次之夜襲、先飛至滬東楊樹浦一帶敵之軍火屯積各地、施以猛烈轟炸後、復飛達浦江敵艦上空、連投數彈、爆炸之聲、震動遐邇、而敵軍亦以高射砲密集向空射擊、我空軍以任務已達、乃從容飛去、其襲擊情態、較第一次尤爲猛烈、</p>
<p>中央社云、在敵軍飛機大肆屠殺我後方非戰鬥人員之際、我忠勇之空軍一隊、昨夜十一時、施其神威、出臨敵軍陣地、當我軍飛機滬空時、敵艦高射砲齋發、我軍安然越過、至楊樹浦及前線一帶轟炸敵軍陣地、予以重創後、安然飛返、</p>
<p>中央社云、我空軍一隊、今晨一時十分再臨滬空、襲擊敵軍陳地、在敵艦高射砲高射機關槍密集射擊中、鏖戰不休、投彈十餘枚、聲震四野、予敵重創、約十餘分鐘後、全部安返、</p>
<h3>敵第四次增援軍昨晨續到五千名</h3>
<p>登陸者已有二萬人　下週將有空前大戰</p>
<p>中央社云、敵第四次增援之軍、合約四萬人、其中一部約五千人、又於昨日上午六時半、七時、八時一刻、及十二時、由敵商輪改建之第六十號運輸艦鶴島丸、第一一二號運輸艦錫蘭丸、第三三六號運輸艦神瑞丸、及運輸艦第一一六號、（名稱不明）第共四艘、陸續駛滬、前二艘停靠於黃浦碼頭、後二艘分靠於大阪及匯山兩碼頭、各增援敵軍、當卽分別登陸、此外在匯山及黃浦兩碼頭、並有大批敵軍馬卸下、總計四日來、由滬東區各碼頭登陸之敵軍、已達二萬人左右、而在沿江各口岸登陸者、尚不在內、聞敵此次援軍日內卽將全部開到、空前未有之大戰、預料於下星期內、卽將展開、</p>
<h3>滬戰我居絕對優勢敵再進犯必予掃蕩</h3>
<p>將士誓與敵不共戴天　敵將用毒氣我已有備</p>
<p>中央社云、上海戰事、我軍現居絶對優勢、敵軍在羅店劉行各綫、被我一再痛擊、頹喪不堪、亟向國內作第四次乞援、現增援敵軍約四萬餘人已大致開到、聞敵方曾宣稱、於明日開始作第四次總攻、但昨日前綫戰况、並不較過去數日爲劇烈、我前綫將士、於一再重創敵軍後、對爭勝利之自信力與把握、益爲堅决、再者此次增援敵軍、多係從台灣朝鮮等處徵調而來、實力並不足畏、敵軍進犯、自必仍遭痛擊敗挫、惟敵軍屢戰屢北、惱羞成怒、除連日派機向我後方各地濫施轟炸外、並一再對外誣蔑謂我軍曾用毒氣彈、及達姆彈、測其用意、蓋爲敵軍將施用此種殘無人道戰具之先聲、據昨由前綫來滬者談、我前綫將士、對敵軍濫肆轟炸後方非戰鬥員、莫不氣憤萬狀、誓不與敵共戴一天、對敵軍將施用殘忍戰具一層、亦已有凖備云、</p>
<h3>羅店右翼我軍挺進</h3>
<p>進抵新興鄕李公浜一帶</p>
<p>羅店方面、我軍右翼、潘涇一綫、竟日與敵發生激戰、雖在敵軍飛機大砲之下、仍奮勇前進、此起彼仆、卒將敵擊潰、向東挺進、現已進抵新興鄕李公浜、在該處與敵激戰甚烈、今晨仍在相持之中、</p>
<h3>昨日浦江敵艦驟增</h3>
<p>共廿九艘目的窺視浦東　敵在浦江中架設瞭望台　並運到大批軍火已起卸</p>
<p>春江碼頭前、原有敵砲艦一艘拋泊、艦內兵士頗多、至昨午四時二十分、該艦突然向東移動、艦首不對陸家嘴、艦身改泊到中棧前江心、較原停之處、約東移一千尺、正不知其用意何在、乃五分鐘以後、敵第二十二隊番號大驅逐艦一艘、急急開來、直到白渡橋江心內掉頭、竟開到北京路外灘之江心、艦首正對浦東、該艦到後、續有大型驅逐艦一號、亦從下游駛來、到耶松廠前停泊、該兩艦未到前、已先有第一隊敵艦兩艘、停於中北棧前、至是連出雲艦在二號河筒、此一隅地、共泊敵艦七艘、停在北京路外灘中心的二十二隊驅逐艦、與美旗艦停留之處、亦頗相近、四時三十一分出雲忽以旗語、與二十二隊艦通話、約歷十餘分鐘、該二十二隊艦、突又退去、改到出雲艦附近停泊、記者見其移去後、始行遄返、</p>
<p>大公社云、昨日午後四時半許、當浦江潮水高漲之際、突有敵艦六艘、相繼駛至日領事館旁三菱碼頭附近一帶停泊、且其中一艘、竟駛至北京路外灘泊於上海市輪渡江面、同時用旗語與第三隊旗艦‘出雲’號通話、嗣歷時二十分鐘、始行駛去、敵艦對犯我浦東之企圖、似無時無刻不在進行也、</p>
<p>大公社云、停泊公和祥碼頭江面第二號浮筒之敵旗艦‘出雲’號、畏我陸空軍之襲擊、曾用種種方法加以防禦、除將我民船多艘盜去、在該艦附近南面築一半圓形防禦物、及將浦江浮筒濫行拆除、在日領事館江面一帶擅自圍定水道、以禁止船隻往來外、今日起、更在該艦南面木船上架設一瞭望臺、離岸十餘公尺、高約丈餘、上分三層、在臺上架一機關槍、以便作窺探我浦東之用、其計巧日窮、顯然可見云、中央社云、昨日浦江停泊敵艦廿九艘、除有數艘時向我浦東陣地發砲轟擊外、並時有數艦往來游弋、企圖登陸、至其停泊情形、分別調査如下、三菱碼頭一號及十一號驅逐艦各一艘、招商中棧砲艦一艘北棧萬光丸一艘、匯山碼頭紅十字艦一艘、築後丸及一一六號運輸艦各一艘、大阪碼頭第六雯海丸一艘、神瑞丸一艘、黃浦碼頭鶴島丸一艘、錫蘭丸一艘、新三井碼頭砲艦一艘、四十號·卅八號·卅七號·八號·七號·四號·三號·及一號浮筒驅逐艦各一艘、五號浮筒驅逐艦二艘、卅一號·二十七號·二十二號·十三號·十一號·九號·浮筒砲艦各一艘、二號浮筒巡洋艦出雲號一艘、以上計巡洋艦一艘、紅十字艦一艘、驅逐艦十二艘、砲艦八艘、運輸艦七艘、共計廿九艘、昨晨五至七時間、有敵運輸艦二艘進口、分泊於匯山碼頭、公和祥碼頭、當卽運下大批軍需品、直至九時半許、仍未畢事、並聞此批軍火中、以大砲彈藥、及機械化器械爲多、同時尚有一部機械化部隊約五百餘人登陸、</p>
<h3>劉行全線暫趨沉寂</h3>
<p>我軍在砲火下向前推進　收復盛家宅小廟等村落</p>
<p>楊行方面之敵、連日向我劉行正面楊木橋一帶陣地、猛烈進攻、我軍奮勇迎戰、直至廿四日晨拂曉、敵以傷亡過重、始不支後潰、於是敵軍復開始其大砲轟擊、集中其火力於我軍所築之工事、但損毁極微、我軍原有陣綫、固守不變、昨日終日、除雙方砲戰外、全綫暫趨沉寂、我軍□部、在砲火之下、向前推進、已收復保安鄕之盛家宅小廟等村落、</p>
<h3>敵艦十餘結集瀏河</h3>
<p>有圖謀登陸模樣</p>
<p>據軍息、瀏河口至馬橋口一帶江面、有敵艦上餘艘集中、並有主力艦一艘、有企圖登岸模樣、我方已嚴予防範、</p>
<h3>敵在楊木橋中地雷</h3>
<p>戰車八輛毀其半　敵軍慘死百餘名</p>
<p>劉行方面連日戰事較烈、敵軍雖竭全力進攻、均經我軍擊潰、昨日新雨初晴、敵又向我猛攻、先以戰車八輛、掩護其步兵數百名、再度向楊木橋衝擊、無如我軍在大勝之後、深知敵軍必將再度進犯、故於當日深晚、在橋端密佈地雷陣地、當戰車步兵齊進衝鋒時、頓時中伏爆發、響聲衝天、八輛戰車頓燬其半、其餘四輛、亦已相當毀損、敵軍步兵當場中雷慘死者亦在一百名以上我軍卽行上前襲擊、敵軍於重創之餘、抵抗仍甚頑强、但終被我軍擊潰、殘毁之敵戰車四輛、則被敵軍設法運回、</p>
<h3>閘北一帶砲彈竟日</h3>
<p>敵砲向我寳山路轟擊　進犯八字橋被我擊退</p>
<p>中央社云、據前方報吿、閘北及江灣一綫、昨日戰况如下、㊀昨晨敵約一中隊進犯我體育會路、水電路、持志大學方面陣地之綫、我守兵沉着應戰、搏戰數次、敵不支退去、㊁八字橋方面、昨日下午二時左右、敵發砲攻擊我陣地、掩護敵軍約一中隊、進窺我警戒綫、我守軍沉着應戰、至下午四時敵始退去、</p>
<p>中央社云、昨日上午五時半、敵機在我閘北一帶陣地、盤旋偵察、九時起、更間隔發砲轟擊我寳山路一帶陣地、下午一時至一時半砲聲尤密、致民房數處被燬、下午四時、砲聲漸停、同時敵機盤旋窺察、並用機關槍掃射、我無損傷、至下午六時、砲聲又起、似爲警戒、蓋防我進攻云、</p>
<h3>敵機昨又濫肆轟炸</h3>
<p>亂拋炸彈濫射機槍無大損　在羅店掩護建築砲兵陣地</p>
<p>浦東</p>
<p>記者於昨午三時到黃浦灘時、第一批敵機爲十架、先分三隊、另有一機獨飛、在浦東高空偵察之下、已擲下炸彈四枚、但見黑煙縷裊、蓋未曾燃燒也、擲此數彈後、改爲兩機一隊並航、不敢低飛、大致在六七千尺的空際、從陸家嘴爛泥渡新開河一段、環繞緩飛、窺察浦東各地、約歷一小時之久、我駐軍因其無的亂投、仍置不睬、四時四十六分、又有敵機九架、分三隊自楊樹浦飛至浦東、該九機乃盤集在其昌棧附近偵察、至五時二十分許、未有所獲、乃亂拋數彈而去、</p>
<p>昨日下午四時、敵機五架、飛於浦東天空、投彈二枚、其後又增至十三架、旋離旋合、大事轟炸、投彈不下二十餘枚、幸該處居民多已避難、故僅燬民房多處、無甚損失、</p>
<p>閘北</p>
<p>連日陰雨綿延、氣壓低劣、敵機己有數日未往我閘北陣地、肆其暴虐、昨日天氣放晴、秋陽高照、敵機三架于淸晨七時許、又復在閘北上空、盤旋偵察、並大投炸彈、其投彈漫無目標、亦不低飛、大約在高有五千公尺之上空、卽以炸彈下投、間或三機同時投彈、故發聲如巨雷、遠近可聞、惟不明其目標所在、故無何損害、</p>
<p>南市</p>
<p>敵機昨日在南市上空盤旋、自上午七時半至十時、敵機凡七架、一架爲導、六架分兩隊、飛至車站路地方法院上空、其低度幾近三層樓之屋面、環繞全滬南區、曾在南黃浦等處投一彈未炸、而其機槍拍拍、從未間斷、至下午二時、三架敵機又出現於上空、盤旋多時、忽向西南方面飛去、嗣又飛回、至四時許、越浦而循浦東歸去、民衆方面、得警察之指導、對於防空已非常嚴密、故已漸少恐怖云、</p>
<p>羅店</p>
<p>中央社云、敵機已兩日未有活動、昨晨又出現於大塲及羅店之上空、施行轟炸、並悉敵機轟炸之目的、僅爲掩護其在羅店附近建築砲兵陣地而已、</p>
<h3>敵迫日僑婦孺歸國</h3>
<p>壯丁留滬强迫服役　骨肉分離怨聲載道</p>
<p>華東社云、據甫自楊樹浦逃出之難民談、近日敵陸海軍方面、强迫日僑婦孺婦國、其輪船卽係運輸敵人軍需之軍艦、使彼輩婦儒、與父兄離別、所有僑滬壯丁、則均遣之入軍、作爲預備隊、或爲嚮導、或運送輜重、使其拋妻別子、作違背良心之慘酷工作、而歸日之婦孺、又與戰場上已死之灰骨同船、格外增加悲感、故當離埠時均滿面淚容、怨聲載道、日人憎恨日軍閥、由此又可得一證明、</p>
<h3>東京招募志願將校</h3>
<p>中央社云、敵大舉來犯我平津及上海、經我奮勇抗戰、敵受創甚重、而中下級軍官犧牲尤多、屢次募集後援兵增援之結果、原有陸軍將校、已不敷調派、茲據東京消息、現已開始招募志願將校、第一次召集步兵佐尉官一百名、於本月底截止、以有現役將校或其兵科之經驗爲合格、加以訓練後自十二月卽錄用云、</p>
<h3>敵患霍亂病死亡數</h3>
<p>寶山縣敵軍已病死數百人　上海附近敵死亡八百餘人</p>
<p>快訊社、本埠廿四日訊、據日軍發言人稱、寳山縣一帶日軍、患霍亂而死亡者、已有二百人、目下尚有三百人患此症、惟據私人方面消息、於過去三星期間、上海附近一帶日軍、患霍亂而死亡者約達八百人、</p>
<h3>昨晨兩處流彈傷人</h3>
<p>共傷男女行人三十六名　兩彈來由刻尚在偵査中</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>再論戰時金融</h3>
<p>— 章乃器</p>
<p>“金融是國家的血液。不是誰家的私財。金融機構是國家的心臟。不是誰家的店誧子。”這是我從前說過的一句話。</p>
<p>根據這個原則我會經要求。平時金融要為國際收支和國民收入打算。而不能專為金融部門的損益和利害打算。</p>
<p>我現在進一步要求。戰時金融不但要為國際收支和國民收入打算。而且要為增强國力和培養民力打算。</p>
<p>金融機構是整個經濟機構的中心。金融的力量。應該是一切經濟活動的領導者。金融對那一業緊縮。那一業便往往要衰落。金融向那一地膨脹。那一地便往往要繁榮。比方倘使過去兩年間金融機構不向棉花押款膨脹。便沒有今年棉花生產的過剩。再此方。倘使過去兩年間金融機構能夠在上海對五金業緊縮。同時在南京對五金業膨脹。五金業的存貨一部分就可以移到南京去。我們只要在膨脹和緊縮之間很巧妙的運用。就已經可以受用不盡。</p>
<p>正是憑着這種巧妙的運用。金融才能替國家收支打算。舉一個例子來證明吧。在兩年以前。三家的華商航業公司因為受不了三家洋商航業公司在長江路的競爭。就和他們訂定了一個營業協定。那時候倘使我們的金融機構能夠供給華商航業公司五千萬元的流動資金。使他們可以繼續競爭下去。那末到後來華商航業公司虧捐了五千萬元的時候。洋商航業公司或者也要虧損五千萬元。那結果。金融機構雖然要吃着五千萬元的呆帳。然而洋商却要少匯回去五千萬元的在華投資收益。我們在國際收支上。就占了五千萬元的便宜。所以倘使打店铺子的小算盤。這件事不能做。而打國家的大算盤。這件事却應該做。</p>
<p>怎樣可以為國民收入打算呢。倘使金融機構貸給進口洋商一百萬元的資金。輸入一批消耗品。外國製造廠家便在那中間賺進十萬元的利潤。那結果。我們就替別人增加了國民收入。而减低了自己的國民收人。如果把這一百萬元貨給中國廠家。使他能夠動員一萬人去生產。而得着十萬元的利潤。我們就增加了自己的國民收入。我們貸出一百元動員一個不生產的人去生產。只要他能生產出來一百零一元的價值。那多出來的一元便是國民收入。</p>
<p>說到戰時金融。那個任務自然是格外高。在平時我們還可以在金錢的數字上打算。所以必須想到國際收支和國民收入。在戰時。我們簡直不能專在金錢的數字上打算。而首先要顧到一個“力”字。在平時。金錢可以變成“力”。而在戰時。金錢不一定可以變成“力。”海岸被封鎖是一個問題。遠水不救近火又是一個問題。</p>
<p>為了要把“力”字擺在第一位。戰時金融在生產方面應該根據自足自給自衛的原則。加緊充實國力。而不能一味計算成本。也不能一味計算收益。比方。我們明知道某種商品自己生產起來成本大。不如進口來得合算。然而為了國防的需要。還只好硬著頭皮鼓勵大家去生產。像德國用極大的成本去生產人工橡皮和媒鍊汽油。我們在自衛的意義之下。是應該仿效的。再比方。有些設備明知道沒有生產的意義。然而為了國防的需要。我們也只好鼓勵大家去設備。如各都市的防空設備。不管是公共的或是私有的。只要能保障國力。我們就應該通融資金鼓勵大家去做。而不能再計較這一筆投資的生產性和穩妥性。倘使救火還打水的算盤。救病還打藥的算盤。用平常腦子去應付非常時期。那是萬萬不可的。</p>
<p>其次。為了把“力”字擺在第一位。戰時金融在人力方面。應該根據“要使全國壯丁個個配稱壯丁”的原則（見本月七日本欄拙作“論戰時金融。”）把培養民力當做主要任務。而不能一味打算國民收入。在平時。貸出一百元動員一個人至少要希望他生產一百零一元的價值。在戰時。那怕只能生產九十八元的價值。不得已的時候也只硬着頭皮做。為的是要使這個人在生產中能夠養活自己訓練自己而變成一個有用之人。這花金錢數字上雖然吃了虧然而在培養民力方面却得著了收獲。總比消極的救濟來得有意義。</p>
<p>怎樣來實現這個戰時金融原則呢。我依然希望大家把整個的金融國策方案擺在第一位。而不要把籌碼問題擺在第一位。因為目下誰都不反對增加籌碼。問題只在如何的增加。才能消極的可以防止惡性膨脹。積極的可以遠到增强國力培養民力的目的在設計方案的時候。更應該牢牢的記着“國訪中心”四個字。而不要只看見一地的榮衰和一業的利害。</p>
<p>比方。說到上海。自然大家都覺得失業問題很嚴重。但是要解决上海的失業問題。治標的只能先予救濟治本的只能向內地設法。在國防意義之下要在上海再來一次膨脹再造成一個買辦性的虛偽繁榮來解决失業問題。那是萬萬不應該。而且也是不可能的。我們只有在上海緊縮在內地膨脹。逼令許多工商業者向內地遷移。同時內地金融流通了。上海的失業者到內地去。也容易解决生活問題了。</p>
<p>向內地膨脹的時候。在工業方面。我們自然要優先恢復工廠生產和採確事業。加緊的提倡手工業。同時進行“輕工業的家庭工業化。”以容納一部分的失業工人。重工業建設。自然也要在無辦法中想出辦法來做。以建立起來自足自給的基礎。在農業方面。第一我們自然應該注意糧食的收集。以鞏固國防。其他的抵押可以酌量的做。以維持農民生計。但是種棉的人今年要吃大虧。卻已經是定案那只好向主張中中經濟提携的人們去算帳了。我們自然還要在開懇荒地增加耕地的工作上努力以容納別一部分失業的人。此外對於內地的文化事業和敎育事震也應該儘量的鼓勵。使到內地去的知識分子和靑年不至有失業失學的苦悶。這是我們的精神國防。是不能稍加忽略的目下內地貼放已逐漸推廣。文化機關的遷移也已開始實行。而且聽說政府還要進一步調整農產工確和貿易。我相信在短時期內一定有更多的事實表現出來。以慰全國喁喁之望。</p>
<p>最後。我希望大家對於我們的戰時經濟。絲毫不必悲觀。我敢說。我們的戰時經濟真好此是“旭日東昇”而敵人的戰時經濟却正是“日暮途窮。”在我們利用戰爭的機綠。正可以把平時的買辦經濟和奴隸經濟的奧皮𡄜拋到汪洋大海裏去。而跨進國民經濟的大道我們有無限的人力可以動員。有無限的資源可以開發只要運用目下已經振奮起來的人心。發動已經集中起來的金融力量去開發這無限的資源眞是打一天好一天。進一步光明一步。而敵人呢。平時經濟已經到了山窮水盡。逼不得已才來一個侵略的軍事投機。資源本來貧乏。壯丁的徵發又要使生產機構趨於破滅。回光返照的戰時經濟早已露出來最後崩潰的朕兆。</p>
<p>我們要忍耐着目前的痛苦。這是嬰兒陸地前後產婦應受的苦難。政治上已經展開了偉大的新時代了。讓我們在經濟上也來展開一們偉大的新時代吧。我們要撳住了創傷。勇往直前的奮門。最後的勝利必然是我們的。</p>

<h3>庫頁島採油問題日蘇發生新糾紛</h3>
<p>日商故意破壞合同　大批俄工人被解雇</p>
<p>［莫斯科］據庫頁島亞力山德洛夫斯基京發來報告、該處享有採煤採油讓與權之日籍商人、近來疊次公然違犯蘇聯法律、最近更公開破壞讓與權合向絛例證明該商人等顯係遵照日本某方之秘密計劃、有意使蘇日邦交嚴重化、因此當地當局及各公團均極表憤概、</p>
<p>一九三七年春、重工業委員會曾應日方右油讓與商之請、召集蘇籍工人約二千人送至海嵾崴、該商本應將此批工人立卽載往庫頁島工作、乃不但並不照辦、反提出無理要求數項、聲稱如蘇方不允、卽不能續運該批工人往庫頁島、結果工人等乃在海嵾崴閒住三個月、直至八月中因蘇方斷然要求、方經送到該島、</p>
<p>及至九月初、該日商忽突然開始開除大批該商自願召雇之蘇籍工人、並凖備於短期內解雇者達二千五百名之多、擔其理由、為凖備縮減工作範圍、並無定期地完全停止探採工作、然而該商原曾極力要求延長庫頁島採油權至五年之久、而蘇聯政府因日政府之聲請、並曾於去年加以承允、且數月前、該商復曾宣佈將採油工作大加擴充、而因此乃請求蘇方代為召雇大批工人、</p>
<p>同時享有採煤讓與權之日商亦實然開始解雇大批工人、據稱於九月內將解雇一千五百人、全區於冬季內僅留百五十人、實際上卽等於完全停止工作、該商人等此種舉動、實屬完全違犯讓與權合同、緣合同內訂明不能由日方片面决定縮减及停頓讓與事業之工作、據重工業委員會當地機關稱、該商等此種舉動將使蘇方遭受極大物質損失、</p>
<p>據日方對當地官員解釋、彼等此種非法可疑行動、乃因其工作遭遇障礙、此種理由顯屬僞飾、緣實際上只要彼等舉動不越出蘇聯法律及讓與合同之外、儘可進行正當工作、據推測該商此種突然舉動之眞正原因、大約係因日本對萊侵略開始以來、彼等在金融、運輸及各方面均已遭遇極大困難、現在地方機關及工會對於此種非法行為、非常憤慨、已要求政府採取必要辦法、保護蘇方利益、並希望重工業委員會制止各該讓與商違犯合同、並加以嚴重警告、同時地方當局並認為因縮减生產而引起之一切損失、應向該日商等提出要求賠償（廿四日塔斯社電）</p>

<h3>敵謀在浦東登陸甚亟雙方有激烈砲戰</h3>
<p>自昨日至今午大砲聲未停　敵艇駛近春江碼頭被擊退　我重砲轟擊敵陣地頗受損</p>
<p>敵方自迭次偷渡浦東失敗以後、前數日盛傳復將大舉進犯之說、但旬日來、在我軍嚴密戒備之下、迄未發生劇烈行動、詎至昨日上午、自三菱碼頭浦面起至楊樹浦底止、敵艦突然增多、除運輸艦與紅十字艦外、共有戰艦二十餘艘、集結浦面、延長約十里、各艦砲位均已對準浦東、我軍得報故通令沿江前綫、</p>
<p>嚴陣以待</p>
<p>形勢頓告極度緊張、嗣於中午以後、敵艦僅斷續發砲、至三時許、敵機十三架、結隊前來、在其昌棧·十八間·洋涇·張家樓·楊家渡·沈家弄·浦東大道·一帶、連續肆虐、投彈轟炸、週而復始、至傍晚六時止、估計投下之彈、不下七八十枚、彈多落於田野內、除少數房屋被波及炸毀外、並無多大損失、同時各敵艦亦於四時始、紛紛</p>
<p>開砲轟擊</p>

<p>響徹雲霄</p>
<p>屋宇均為震動、我方砲彈、均落於楊樹浦一帶敵軍陣地、雙方砲戰之烈、自浦東開戰以來為第一次、至午夜十二時敵艇四艘、滿載日兵六七十名、在砲火猛烈之下、分別駛近浦東春江碼頭敵開、用機槍向岸上掃射、同時敵艦兩艘、亦以重機關槍協助我守駐碼頭口之機槍手、乃施展神技、一面抵禦兵艦一面向敵艇</p>
<p>猛烈還擊</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 南</p>
<p>“有錢者出錢。有力者出力。”是同赴國難最有力量的一種表示。可是“有錢者”三字的界說。最難恰當。說他是有錢。他决不肯承認。說他是無錢。他却明明有錢。卽使他承認了有錢。還要與人家相比。以表示他不如人之有錢。這種心理不能說是完全不當。可是於“出錢”方面。不無影響。</p>
<p>所以有錢者的出錢。也要有錢人中熱心份子來提倡。然後能收最大的效果。若能得下列幾種人出而提倡。購買救國公債。比之芝麻零星的勸募。效力大得多了。</p>

<h3>我們是“被逼”在這兒開展覽會</h3>
<p>我們是“被逼”——在這兒開展覽會，</p>
<p>人家不但用“武力戰”，陸戰海戰空戰來侵略我們，它們在“併用戰”上，也狠命地來侵略我們，“經濟侵略”，不是嗎？訂了許多許多不平等條約的“政略戰”，不是嗎？還想用“思想戰”來壓制我們“文化侵略”已經夠了，它們，還不罷休，在中國的領土上它們竟敢用“文化壓制”來壓制我們，——我們中國人！</p>
<p>雖然我們這些小孩子的作品，非但幼稚，簡直亂塗，正可以說像也不像什麼？東一塊紅，西一塊黑，眞不能算畫，當然更不能算名畫，有價值的畫，但在他們只知拿了掃帚樣的筆，筆頭上攪了些顏色，在紙上亂塗的時候，他們只覺得頭頂上有敵人的飛機在“呼呼”地旋轉，耳朶邊有敵人的重砲在“隆隆”地響，他們只覺得我們忠勇的壯士在前綫舉起了槍刺，衝呀！一槍刺過來，殺呀！敵人一個個的向後倒下去，我們忠勇的壯士是衝過去！戰壕裹，鐵絲網邊，地上，天上，都是紅的——紅的血，紅的砲火，一顆顆紅的壯士的心，我們只知道隨着腦子拿筆像在前綫都殺敵人一般地瘋狂，興奮，在紙上塗，塗過去，自己只知道自己這呌“精神”！這呌“力量”！塗了一張又一張，堆成了這許多“精神”！這許多“力量”！</p>
<p>我們並不知道是畫，因為我們不是名畫家，大畫家！這要希望多多原諒這般疯狂的小孩子的。</p>
<p>我們自敵人侵略我們上海的第一天的做起，做到今天，還不到一個半月，但很安慰，我們全部的工作終算完成了，我們天天慰勞，差不多個個傷兵醫院，個個收容所都走到，請漫畫界替我們畫了三幀巨幅救亡畫，（我們也想展覽出來，在“九一八”也想用大汽車裝出來遊行．但是……）我們自己也學着全體合作了一幀巨幅“中國先鋒隊”，預備去獻給政府，雖然畫得不像樣子，但我們自己看裏面有中國千萬的軍隊，無數的坦克車，成隊的砲車從鐵的長城裏浩浩蕩蕩地出來，城裏還聳出了四尊大砲，天空中有無數的飛機，這是我們驚醒侵略者的迷夢的空軍，一大隊一大隊地從長城裏飛出來！</p>
<p>我們是由十二方尺這麼小的一方紙裏做出來，可憐這般瘋狂的孩子，只為吃些硬硬的山東餅和白開水，現在我們終算這樣地做了短短的一個半月送給全國小朋友的“中國兒童”已出版了，“砲火中”（由“一二八”的砲火，寫到這次“八一三”“放下你的鞭子”，“夢遊北平”、寫淪亡了的故都）也演出了，由聯華分廠去改攝影了。</p>
<p>現在我們是“被逼”，被逼不能在這兒做下去！但，我們，侵略者一天不死，我們的工作一天不休息。</p>
<p>我們只知道，我們有“精神”！有“力量”！</p>
<p>我們被逼，先到首都去，分二條路綫，從漢口到四川……去和腹地的同胞握手！到南洋，和親愛的僑胞握手！</p>
<p>我們是被逼，被逼離開了這兒，再會！</p>
<h3>畫裏的眞趣</h3>
<p>— 九歲陳娟娟</p>
<p>我們小孩子不懂得虛偽，也不會說假話，什麼事都從心底下發出，悲傷時候，就拉開嘴哭一塲，高興時又笑一頓，大人們說我們天眞，這天眞一定是說不會故意做作的道理。</p>
<p>譬如我們畫的圖畫，也是不懂什麼顧忌的。近來我作了不少的圖畫，專門取這一次抗戰做背景，愈畫愈高興，愈高興愈要畫。我畫一架大飛機，飛到敵軍司令部撒一顆大炸彈，把下面屋子統炸毀了，又畫中國大刀隊，把敵軍一個一個頭統統殺下，由另一個中國兵提回來，那中國大刀隊的兵也大踏步的神氣活現踱回來，表示：“我勇氣嗎？”像這樣抗敵的畫，我一連畫了幾十張，大家都說“好呀！好呀！”</p>
<p>現在我這批大作都送到兒童救亡漫畫展覽會陳列，請各界大人先生足下指敎指敎，再會。</p>
<h3>大家來殺侵略我們的人呀！</h3>
<p>— 十六歲沈駿</p>
<h3>二幅滿意作品</h3>
<p>— 九歲黎鏗</p>
<p>我喜歡打乓乒球，大家也曉得我歡喜打乓兵球的，然而呀我近來不愛打乓乒球了，爲會麼呀，我因爲用心畫圖畫，拚命畫圖畫一天要畫三張圖畫。我頂滿意的一張呌：“你敢進來嗎？給你一刀一槍”這一刀一槍的畫非常有力又硬，精神百倍。還有一張滿意的呌：“凱旋”畫一排中國兵滿面都是血流着，然而毫不在意的面上個現着歡笑，手伸得很高的和我們招招。這二幅大畫都在這一次展覽會中現出在各位先生面前。</p>
<h3>為什麼不能畫太陽旗？</h3>
<p>— 七歲牟菱</p>
<p>我們在沒有開“第一次兒童救亡漫畫展覽會”的時候，我們很熱心的畫着救亡漫畫，好容易一張一張畫好了，有幾張上面有日本的太陽旗，但是這幾張畫聽說不可以展覽出來，還要把太陽旗塗掉，哼！我眞氣，我們爲什麼不能畫侵略我們的敵人的太陽旗？</p>
<h3>看槍！</h3>
<p>— 十五歲徐湘影</p>
<h3>漫畫救亡</h3>
<p>— 十四歲姚元炎</p>
<p>暴日侵略我國，已經有好幾十年了，雖然我們也曾在“一二八”的時候，寫了好些標語：“打倒日本帝國主義”“抵制日貨”等等，但是“一二八”停戰之後，我再也沒有看見過這種情形了。</p>
<p>“八一三”滬戰發生，這就是中日全面戰爭的前奏曲。我們兒童想寫些文字來宣傳暴日的殘殺我們的同胞和我們忠勇的將士為國犧牲，但是寫不來，於是又想出了演講，但是沒有好的稿子是不行的，我們又講不來話，又失敗了，終於，給我們想出來了，我們可以拿畫圖來表示出來，我們知道，我們的將士是勇敢的，和善的，就畫了一只和顏悅色的和勇敢的面孔，我們知道日本軍人是殘暴和膽怯的，於是畫了一副兇惡而喪膽的臉，我們知道甚麼東西是甚麼顏色，就加上了甚麼顏色，我們要讓全上海兒童，全上海的人民知道我們的能力，我們更要讓全中國的人民知道我們小國民的力量和日本鬼子的殘暴！</p>
<h3>衝！衝！衝鋒的號嚮！衝！</h3>
<p>— 十六歲王子清</p>
<h3>救亡和漫畫</h3>
<p>— 十五歲沈駿</p>
<p>我們給日本鬼子欺侮好多年，直到如今不得不起來抵抗，所以我們現在就在這裏畫了很多的畫，表示出我們的勇氣，因為日本敢傷我們太深了，我們知道砲打出來是怎樣的？日本鬼子是什麼樣？中國軍隊是什麼樣？飛機，槍，砲，炸彈，大刀隊，兵艦，還有種種的武器都畫在這裏面，我們要鼓起精神，去殺可惡的日本鬼子，驅逐我們的仇敵，收復我們的土地，我們不願做亡國奴大家要挺起胸膛保護我們的士地這是我們開漫畫救亡的意義。</p>
<h3>開“救亡漫畫”展覽會斡麼呀？</h3>
<p>— 十六歲蔣屈橋</p>
<p>我們開“救亡漫畫”展覽會幹麼呀？告訴你，小朋友：我們看到國家被日本强盜弄得很糟，我們勇敢的兵士在前綫殺日本猪玀，我們為國家心痛。我們眞恨，我們爲什麼長得這麼小，不然我們亦好掮上槍，拿了大刀，到前綫去殺一個大開心。</p>
<p>國家是大家的，國家有危險，大家都應該起來救，我們沒有氣力掮槍，難道我們就不要救國嗎？我們是中國人，我們是不願意做亡國奴的中國人。我們怕人家罵做亡國奴的坏子，沒有出息的東西，我們要救國，每個人都情願，有一點力量，拿一點力量出來救。我們二十來個小朋友，天天想，想為國家盡一點力量。</p>
<p>就在八月廿九號那一天，給我們想到了，我們來作救亡圖畫宣傳，用圖畫來告訴小朋友們，國家危險到怎樣地步；我們的兵士在前綫很勇敢的殺日本鬼子；我們大家要起來，起來挽救這國家的危險。想到就畫，我們天天拚命的畫。到現在到也有這麼多。雖然畫得都不好，但是我們也覺得很滿意。</p>
<p>我們眞舒服，因為我門亦為國家盡了一點點的力量。並且我們以後更加要努力，還要來第二次，第三次的漫畫展覽會呢！</p>
<h3>起來！全中國的小朋友們！</h3>
<p>— 十六歲蔣柏生</p>
<h3>兒童漫畫展覽會</h3>
<p>— 十五歲徐湘影</p>
<p>全面的抗戰已開始了，全中國同胞的血也在跟着沸騰起來，有力的出力，有錢的出錢，前方的兵士奮勇地殺敵，他們是爲了保衛我們這個有着四千年歷史和四萬五千萬的黃帝子孫的中國而將他們的熱血洒在戰塲上，但我們都是很幼稚的無知的孩子，在我們能力方面，當然不能赴戰塲殺敵，但是我們也是中國的人民，我們都應該負起一個大的使命去貢獻於我們的祖國。</p>
<p>所以在這個暑期中，我們就聚集了許多小朋友組織了一個兒童界救亡協會，我們的智識當然很淺簿，屢次我們想做一些工作，如募捐，但因為現實社會的黑暗，漢奸又多，終使我們的工作不能繼續下去，經黃先生的領導，在最短時間中我們終於决定開一個兒童漫畫展覽會，各位小朋友都興奮地工作着，虽然我们的成績不甚好，對於國家沒有直接的益處，但當每一個民衆看起那紅的血和砲火的時候，我想每一個人一定會慮動吧不久我們將要貢獻給每一個中華民國的同胞面前希望諸位給予正確的批評和指正。</p>
<h3>各界救亡工作</h3>
<p>兒童界</p>
<p>兒童界救亡協會、昨日下午三時、在該會招待各界到各當局、各慈善團體，各救亡協會、及各通訊社各報館等代表五十餘人、先由該會負責人報告會務近況、及工作計劃、其工作分慰勞救亡宣傳電影出版戲劇等五部、戲劇部已排“放下你的鞭子”砲火中”及“夢遊北平”三救亡劇、由黎鏗陳娟娟牟菱等主演、先赴各難民收容所及傷兵醫院演出、再隨救亡宣傳部赴各地宣傳、電影部將排好之三種兒童救亡劇、攝成影片、携往各鄉鎮流動映演、繼由兒童界代表黎鏗陳娟娟牟菱演說、歷一時餘始散會、</p>
<p>漫畫界</p>
<p>“救亡漫畫”自創刋號出世後、極為一般人士所稱許復為熱心讀者大批購買、張貼於各里弄或收容所內、是以該報創刋號、曾一度再版、聞第一號定今日（二十六日）出版、內容更豐富、封面為江敉所作之“日人搬屍回國”蔡若虹之連續漫畫“我們沒有了家、”陳浩雜之“上海大變、”沈振庚之“正義的火熖燃遍了東亞大陸、”宣相權之“國際間予日本人意外的同情、”以及魯少飛之“五日導報漫畫”、皆精心作品、能以諷刺的手腕、對敵人加以進攻、或以鼓勵的畫面、鼓勵同胞救亡之情緒預料此期之“救亡漫畫”將更爲讀者所歡迎、</p>
<h3>日本的海軍狀況</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>一九二一年華盛頓開五國軍縮會議，結果。規定英美日三國主力艦保有之勢力。為五，五，三之比率．卽英美二國各保有主力艦的總噸數五十二萬五千噸。日本三十一萬五千噸。其後日本違反條約。秘密建艦。所以到了倫敦會議後。日又提出平等。給果因遭各國的反對，會議逐告决裂。自是以後。日本來了無條約時代。傾力擴充軍備，現在究竟有多少主力艦與補助艦呢。那就不容易明白了。茲就五年前所調查共計三百八十三雙。百十五萬六千餘噸。內計大戰艦　隻如下：</p>
<p>甲，主力艦，（戰艦）陸奧（三三、八○○噸）備一六吋砲八門，長門（三三、八○○噸）（同前），日向（三一、二六○噸）備十四吋砲十一門，伊勢（同前）（同前），山城（三○、六○○噸）（同前），扶桑（同前）（同前）（巡洋戰艦）霧島（二七、五○○噸）（備十四吋砲八門），榛名）三○、五○○噸）（同前），比叡（二七、五○○噸）（同前），金剛（同前）。</p>
<p>這就是日本海軍的主力，所謂六四艦隊，是以戰艦六隻巡洋艦四隻編成的。</p>
<p>乙，（補助艦）一等巡洋艦十二隻，二等巡洋艦廿一隻，航空母艦四隻，一等驅逐艦七十隻，二等驅逐艦三十五隻，潛水母艦四隻，一等潛水艦二十八隻，二等潛水艦三十六隻，水雷艇二隻，數設艦五隻，海防艦八隻，砲艦十三隻，掃海艦十二隻，特務艦二十四隻（其秘不發表者尚不在內）（航空母艦）赤城（二六九○○噸）（備二十糎吋大砲十門，十一糎砲十二門）加賀（二六九○○噸）（備二十糎吋大砲十門，十二糎砲十一門）龍驤（未詳）鳳翔（七、四○○噸），（巡洋艦）妙高（一○、○○○噸）（備八吋砲十門那智）（一○、○○○噸）（備八吋砲十門）足柄（一○，○○○噸）（備八吋砲十門）羽黑（一○、○○○噸）（備八吋砲十門）高雄（一○、○○○噸）（備八吋砲十門）愛宕（一○、○○○噸）（備八吋砲十門鳥海（一○、○○○噸）（備八吋砲十門）摩耶（一○、○○○噸）（備八吋砲十門）加古，（七五○○噸）（備八吋砲六門）古鷹（七、五○○噸）（備八吋砲六門）衣笠（七五○○噸）（備八吋砲六門）靑葉（七、五○○噸）（備八吋砲六門）（輕巡洋艦）天龍（三、五○○噸）（備五吋五砲四門）龍田（三、五○○噸）（備五吋五砲四門）球磨五、五○○噸）（備五吋五砲七門）多摩（五、五○○噸）（備五吋五砲七門）北上（五、五○○噸）（備五吋五砲七門）大井（五、五○○噸）（備五吋五砲七門）木曾（五、五○○噸（備五吋五砲七門）長良（五、五七○噸）備砲同前）五十鈴（五、五七○噸）（備砲同前）名取（五、五七○噸）（備砲同前）由良（五、五七○噸）（備砲同前）鬼怒（五、五七○噸）（備砲同前）阿武喂（五、五七○噸）（備砲同前）那琦（五、五七○噸）（備砲同前）川內（五、五七○噸）（備砲同前）神通（五、五七○噸）（備砲同前）夕張（三、一○○噸）（備五時五砲六門）（潛水艦）伊號（自第一至第五，一、九七○噸）（備水雷發射管六門）伊號（自第二十一至廿四，一一五○噸）（備水雷發射管四門）伊號（第五十一第五十二，一、四○○噸）（備水雷發射管八門）伊號（自第五十三至第五十九，一、六○○噸）（備水雷發射管八門）伊號（第六十第六十一，一、六○○噸）備水雷發射管六門）伊號（第六十二第六十三、一六○○噸八閂），伊號第六十四第六十七、一六○○噸六門），呂號（自第一第二、六八九噸同五門）呂號（自第三至第五同）前同前，呂號第十一第十二、二七○噸）同六門，呂號（自第三至第二十五、七四○噸）同六門，呂號（自第三十六至第二十八、七五○噸）同四門，呂號（自第二十九至三十二、六六五噸）同四門，呂號（自第五十一至第五十九、九○○噸）同六門，呂號）自第六十至六十八、九九八噸）同六門，波號（第一、第二二八六噸）同三二門，了波號（自第至第五二九一噸）同前，波號第六、六○四噸（波號）同前，第七第八，二九○噸）同四門，（波號（第九、四八○噸）同前，</p>
<p>以上所據僅尚係五年前已成的艦，在此五年內陸續建造者，因海軍省嚴守秘密尚無確實數字可䅲。約自入無條約時代以來，傾全力建造大量軍艦以與美國相抗衡。其中潛水艇已超過美國，成爲美八、五日一○的比例，目已居五國的冠。耶艦數比華，英爲五、○○，美三·四六、法一·一五、意一·一五，而日本竟有八·八四隻。日本如此擴張海軍廣爲推行南進政策。換句話來說：就是要發展南洋方面的勢力。</p>

<h3>The Enemy's Fourth Wave of Reinforcements Arrives, Plotting a Major Offensive, But We Are Determined to Inflict a Crushing Blow</h3>
<p>Our Forces Make Significant Gains in Luodian and Liuhang. Only Minor Skirmishes Occur Outside the Artillery Battles at Jiangwan and Zhabei. Our Air Force Conducts a Night Raid, Heavily Bombarding Enemy Positions.</p>
<p>The entire Shanghai battlefront was quite calm yesterday. Apart from the artillery battles in Luodian, Liuhang, Jiangwan, and Zhabei, there were only minor skirmishes involving local outposts. The enemy has admitted to facing unexpectedly strong resistance from our forces, so they dare not attempt an offensive until reinforcements arrive to replenish their numbers. Of the enemy's fourth wave of reinforcements, consisting of 40,000 troops, another 5,000 arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. In total, approximately 20,000 have already landed. It is expected that once all of the enemy's reinforcements arrive, they will launch a major offensive. However, our forces are defending strongly and are well-prepared, and we will certainly inflict a crushing blow when the time comes. A major battle, unprecedented in scale, is likely to occur within the next week. Last night and this morning, our air force twice raided enemy positions in Yangshupu, carrying out heavy bombing. The enemy was caught off guard and suffered significant losses.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Twice Raids Enemy Positions at Night</h3>
<p>Bombing Successful, Planes Return Safely</p>
<p>At 10:55 PM last night, our air force again soared over enemy ships in the Huangpu River and enemy positions in eastern Shanghai, carrying out bombing raids. The sound of the planes came from north to south, and searchlights and red signals on enemy ships immediately flew into the sky, while the sound of anti-aircraft guns and machine guns also progressed from north to south. After about twenty minutes, the sound of the planes faded away, and the enemy's anti-aircraft fire also ceased.</p>
<p>At 1:17 AM this morning, our air force continued its second night raid, first flying to enemy ammunition depots in the Yangshupu area of eastern Shanghai, carrying out heavy bombing, and then flying over enemy ships in the Huangpu River, dropping several bombs. The sound of the explosions shook the surrounding area, and the enemy also fired densely into the air with anti-aircraft guns. Our air force, having completed its mission, flew away calmly. The nature of this attack was even more intense than the first.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, while enemy aircraft were wantonly slaughtering our non-combatant personnel in the rear, a team of our loyal and brave air force, at 11:00 PM last night, demonstrated their divine power by appearing over enemy positions. When our aircraft were in Shanghai's airspace, enemy ships fired anti-aircraft guns in unison, but our forces safely passed over them, bombed enemy positions in the Yangshupu and front-line areas, inflicted heavy damage, and then returned safely.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a team of our air force returned to Shanghai's airspace at 1:10 AM this morning, attacking enemy positions. Amidst the dense firing of anti-aircraft guns and machine guns from enemy ships, they fought relentlessly, dropping more than ten bombs, the sound of which shook the surrounding area, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. After about ten minutes, they all returned safely.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Fourth Wave of Reinforcements Continues to Arrive Yesterday Morning, With 5,000 More Soldiers</h3>
<p>The number of those landing has reached 20,000. A major battle will take place next week.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, of the enemy's fourth wave of reinforcements, totaling approximately 40,000 troops, a portion of about 5,000 men arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 6:30 AM, 7:00 AM, 8:15 AM, and 12:00 PM, respectively, on the No. 60 transport ship Tsurushima Maru, the No. 112 transport ship Ceylon Maru, the No. 336 transport ship Shinzuimaru, and the transport ship No. 116 (name unknown), all of which were converted from enemy merchant ships. The first two docked at the Huangpu Wharf, and the latter two docked at the Osaka and Huishan Wharfs, respectively. The enemy reinforcements immediately disembarked separately. In addition, large numbers of enemy horses were unloaded at the Huishan and Huangpu Wharfs. In total, over the past four days, the number of enemy troops landing at various wharfs in the eastern Shanghai area has reached approximately 20,000, not including those landing at various ports along the river. It is reported that all of the enemy's reinforcements will arrive within the next few days, and a major battle, unprecedented in scale, is expected to unfold within the next week.</p>
<h3>We Maintain Absolute Advantage in the Shanghai Battle; Any Further Enemy Offensives Will Be Crushed</h3>
<p>Soldiers Vow Not to Coexist with the Enemy; We Are Prepared for the Enemy's Use of Poison Gas</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, our forces currently hold an absolute advantage in the Shanghai battle. The enemy forces on the Luodian and Liuhang lines have been repeatedly defeated by us, and they are in a state of demoralization. They have urgently requested a fourth wave of reinforcements from their home country. The current reinforcements, numbering approximately 40,000, have largely arrived. It is reported that the enemy has declared that they will launch a fourth general offensive starting tomorrow, but yesterday's front-line situation was not more intense than in the past few days. After repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, our front-line soldiers are even more confident and determined to win victory. Furthermore, the enemy's current reinforcements are mostly conscripted from places like Taiwan and Korea, and their strength is not to be feared. Any enemy offensive will inevitably be met with a crushing defeat. However, the enemy, having suffered repeated defeats, has become enraged and, in addition to sending aircraft to wantonly bomb our rear areas every day, has repeatedly falsely accused us of using poison gas bombs and dumdum bullets. It is suspected that this is a prelude to the enemy's use of such inhumane weapons of war. According to those who came to Shanghai from the front line yesterday, our front-line soldiers are filled with anger at the enemy's wanton bombing of non-combatants in the rear, and they have vowed not to coexist with the enemy under the same sky. They are also prepared for the enemy's use of cruel weapons of war.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Advance on the Right Flank of Luodian</h3>
<p>Reaching the Xinxing Township and Ligongbang Area</p>
<p>On the Luodian front, our troops on the right flank, along the Panjing line, engaged in fierce battles with the enemy throughout the day. Despite enemy aircraft and artillery fire, they bravely advanced, one after another, and finally defeated the enemy, advancing eastward. They have now reached the Xinxing Township and Ligongbang area, where they are engaged in intense battles with the enemy. They are still in a stalemate as of this morning.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Increase Suddenly in the Huangpu River Yesterday</h3>
<p>A total of 29 ships, aiming to spy on Pudong. The enemy erects an observation post in the Huangpu River and transports a large amount of military supplies for unloading.</p>
<p>In front of the Chunjiang Wharf, there was originally one enemy gunboat anchored, with many soldiers on board. At 4:20 PM yesterday, the ship suddenly moved eastward, with its bow no longer facing Lujiazui, and its hull anchored in the center of the river in front of Zhongzhan, about 1,000 feet east of its original position. It is unknown what its purpose was. Five minutes later, one of the enemy's 22nd Squadron destroyers rushed in, turned around inside the Baidu Bridge in the center of the river, and headed to the center of the river off the Bund on Beijing Road, with its bow facing Pudong. After this ship arrived, one large destroyer, No. 1, also sailed in from downstream and stopped in front of the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Wharf. Before these two ships arrived, two enemy ships from the 1st Squadron had already stopped in front of the Zhongbei Wharf. Thus, including the Izumo in the No. 2 river tube, a total of seven enemy ships were docked in this corner. The 22nd Squadron destroyer, which was docked in the center of the Bund on Beijing Road, was also quite close to the location where the US flagship was stationed. At 4:31 PM, the Izumo suddenly used flag signals to communicate with the 22nd Squadron ship for about ten minutes. The 22nd Squadron ship suddenly retreated again and stopped near the Izumo. After seeing it move away, the reporter returned promptly.</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News, at about 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, when the tide was high in the Huangpu River, suddenly six enemy ships sailed one after another to the area near the Mitsubishi Wharf next to the Japanese Consulate and docked. Moreover, one of them even sailed to the Bund on Beijing Road and docked on the Shanghai Ferry river surface. At the same time, it used flag signals to communicate with the 3rd Squadron flagship 'Izumo'. It then sailed away after about twenty minutes. The enemy's attempt to invade our Pudong seems to be in progress at all times.</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News, the enemy flagship 'Izumo', which is docked on the No. 2 buoy on the river surface of the Gonghexiang Wharf, has taken various measures to defend against attacks by our land and air forces. In addition to stealing several of our civilian ships, building a semi-circular defensive structure near the south side of the ship, and wantonly dismantling the Huangpu River buoys, it has also arbitrarily enclosed the waterway in the area of the Japanese Consulate's river surface to prohibit ships from passing through. Starting today, an observation post will be erected on a wooden boat on the south side of the ship, about ten meters from the shore and about ten meters high. A machine gun will be mounted on the post to spy on our Pudong. Its ingenuity is clearly evident. According to the Central News Agency, 29 enemy ships were docked in the Huangpu River yesterday. In addition to a few ships firing artillery shells at our Pudong positions from time to time, several ships were also cruising back and forth, attempting to land. The details of their docking are as follows: the Mitsubishi Wharf has one No. 1 and one No. 11 destroyer each, the China Merchants North Wharf has one gunboat and one Wanguang Maru each, the Huishan Wharf has one Red Cross ship, one Tsukugo Maru and one No. 116 transport ship each, the Osaka Wharf has one Sixth Wenhai Maru and one Shinzuimaru each, the Huangpu Wharf has one Tsurushima Maru and one Ceylon Maru each, the New Mitsui Wharf has one gunboat, and the No. 40, No. 38, No. 37, No. 8, No. 7, No. 4, No. 3, and No. 1 buoys each have one destroyer. The No. 5 buoy has two destroyers, and the No. 31, No. 27, No. 22, No. 13, No. 11, and No. 9 buoys each have one gunboat. The No. 2 buoy has one cruiser Izumo. The above includes one cruiser, one Red Cross ship, twelve destroyers, eight gunboats, and seven transport ships, totaling 29 ships. From 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM yesterday morning, two enemy transport ships entered the port and docked at the Huishan Wharf and Gonghexiang Wharf, respectively. They immediately unloaded a large amount of military supplies, and the work was still not completed by 9:30 AM. It is reported that this batch of military supplies mainly consisted of artillery ammunition and mechanized equipment. At the same time, a mechanized unit of about 500 people also landed.</p>
<h3>The Entire Liuhang Line Temporarily Becomes Quiet</h3>
<p>Our Troops Advance Under Artillery Fire, Recapturing Villages Such As Shengjiazhai and Xiaomiao</p>
<p>The enemy in the Yanghang area has been fiercely attacking our positions along the Yangmu Bridge area on the front of Liuhang for several days. Our troops have been bravely fighting back. By dawn on the 24th, the enemy, having suffered heavy casualties, was unable to withstand the attack and collapsed. The enemy then began its artillery bombardment, concentrating its fire on the fortifications built by our troops, but the damage was minimal. Our original front line remained firmly defended. Throughout yesterday, apart from artillery battles between the two sides, the entire line temporarily became quiet. Our troops advanced under artillery fire and have recaptured villages such as Shengjiazhai and Xiaomiao in Bao'an Township.</p>
<h3>More Than Ten Enemy Ships Gather at Liuhang</h3>
<p>Appearing to Be Planning a Landing</p>
<p>According to military intelligence, there are more than ten enemy ships concentrated in the river area from the Liuhangkou to Maqiaokou, including one capital ship, appearing to be planning a landing. Our side has taken strict precautions.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Plants Landmines in Yangmu Bridge</h3>
<p>Eight Tanks Destroyed, Half of Them; More Than One Hundred Enemy Soldiers Killed Miserably</p>
<p>The battles in the Liuhang area have been relatively fierce in recent days. Although the enemy has tried its best to attack, it has been defeated by our forces. Yesterday, after a new rain cleared up, the enemy attacked us again. First, they used eight tanks to cover several hundred of their infantry, and once again charged towards Yangmu Bridge. However, after our great victory, our troops knew that the enemy would definitely attack again, so they secretly laid a minefield at the end of the bridge late that night. When the tanks and infantry charged forward together, they were suddenly ambushed and exploded, and the sound shook the sky. Half of the eight tanks were destroyed, and the other four were also significantly damaged. More than one hundred enemy infantry soldiers were killed instantly by the mines. Our troops immediately launched an attack, and the enemy, despite suffering heavy casualties, still resisted stubbornly, but was finally defeated by our forces. The four remaining damaged enemy tanks were taken back by the enemy.</p>
<h3>Artillery Shells Rained Down on Zhabei All Day</h3>
<p>Enemy Artillery Bombarded Our Baoshan Road; An Attempt to Attack Baziqiao Was Repelled By Us</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the situation on the Zhabei and Jiangwan lines yesterday was as follows, according to front-line reports: (1) Yesterday morning, about one company of the enemy attacked our positions along the line of Tiyuhui Road, Shuidian Road, and Chih Chih University. Our defending soldiers calmly responded to the attack and fought several times, and the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated. (2) On the Baziqiao front, at about 2:00 PM yesterday, the enemy fired artillery shells to attack our positions, covering about one company of enemy troops who were attempting to probe our警戒綫. Our defending soldiers calmly responded to the attack, and the enemy did not retreat until 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, at 5:30 AM yesterday morning, enemy aircraft circled and scouted our positions in the Zhabei area. Starting at 9:00 AM, they fired artillery shells intermittently to bombard our positions along Baoshan Road. The sound of artillery fire was particularly dense from 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM, causing several civilian houses to be destroyed. At 4:00 PM, the sound of artillery fire gradually stopped. At the same time, enemy aircraft circled and scouted, and fired machine guns, but we suffered no damage. At 6:00 PM, the sound of artillery fire started again, seemingly as a precaution, to prevent us from attacking.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Again Carry Out Wanton Bombing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Randomly Dropping Bombs and Firing Machine Guns, Causing Little Damage; Covering the Construction of Artillery Positions in Luodian</p>
<p>Pudong</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived at the Bund at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the first batch of enemy aircraft consisted of ten planes, divided into three teams, with one plane flying alone. Under the reconnaissance of the planes flying at high altitude over Pudong, four bombs were dropped, but only black smoke was seen, and they did not ignite. After dropping these few bombs, they changed to two planes flying together, and did not dare to fly low. They generally flew slowly in the airspace of six to seven thousand feet, circling and scouting various parts of Pudong from the Lujiazui Muddy Beach to the Xinkai River. This lasted for about an hour. Our garrison ignored them because they were just throwing bombs randomly. At 4:46 PM, another nine enemy aircraft, divided into three teams, flew from Yangshupu to Pudong. The nine planes gathered near the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Wharf to scout. At about 5:20 PM, having found nothing, they randomly dropped a few bombs and left.</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, five enemy aircraft flew over the Pudong sky and dropped two bombs. Later, the number increased to thirteen, and they alternately approached and separated, carrying out heavy bombing, dropping no less than twenty bombs. Fortunately, most of the residents in the area had already evacuated, so only many civilian houses were destroyed, and there was not much damage.</p>
<p>Zhabei</p>
<p>After several days of continuous rain and low air pressure, enemy aircraft had not dared to carry out their atrocities in our Zhabei positions for several days. Yesterday, the weather cleared up, and the autumn sun shone brightly. Three enemy aircraft, at about 7:00 AM in the morning, again circled and scouted over Zhabei, and dropped bombs extensively. Their bombing was aimless, and they did not fly low. They dropped bombs from an altitude of about 5,000 meters, sometimes with three planes dropping bombs at the same time, so the sound was like a huge thunder, which could be heard far and wide. However, their target was unknown, so there was no damage.</p>
<p>Nanshi</p>
<p>Enemy aircraft circled over Nanshi yesterday. From 7:30 AM to 10:00 AM, there were a total of seven enemy aircraft, one leading and six divided into two teams, flying over the area of the Train Station Road Local Court. Their altitude was almost the same as the roof of a three-story building, and they circled the entire southern district of Shanghai. They dropped one bomb at Nanhuangpu and other places, which did not explode, and their machine guns kept firing. At 2:00 PM, three enemy aircraft appeared in the sky again, circled for a long time, and suddenly flew to the southwest. Then they flew back and, at about 4:00 PM, crossed the Huangpu River and returned along Pudong. The public, under the guidance of the police, has become very strict about air defense, so there is gradually less fear.</p>
<p>Luodian</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, enemy aircraft had not been active for two days. Yesterday morning, they appeared again over Douchang and Luodian, carrying out bombing. It is understood that the enemy aircraft's bombing was only to cover the construction of their artillery positions near Luodian.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces Japanese Nationals Women and Children to Return Home</h3>
<p>Strong Men Are Forced to Serve in Shanghai, Creating Resentment and Separation of Families</p>
<p>According to the East China News Agency, refugees who have just escaped from Yangshupu say that recently, the enemy's army and navy have forced Japanese women and children to return home. The ships they are using are military ships transporting enemy military supplies, separating them from their fathers and brothers. All Japanese nationals in Shanghai who are strong men are sent to the military to serve as reserves, guides, or to transport supplies, forcing them to abandon their wives and children and do cruel work against their conscience. The women and children returning to Japan are on the same ship as the ashes of those who have died on the battlefield, which adds to their grief. Therefore, when they leave Shanghai, their faces are full of tears and resentment. The Japanese people's hatred of the Japanese military is another proof of this.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Recruits Volunteer Officers</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy has launched a large-scale invasion of our Pingjin and Shanghai. After our brave resistance, the enemy has suffered heavy losses, and many middle and lower-ranking officers have been sacrificed. As a result of repeated recruitment of reinforcements, the original army officers are no longer sufficient for deployment. According to news from Tokyo, they have now begun to recruit volunteer officers. The first recruitment is for 100 infantry officers, which will close at the end of this month. Those with experience as active-duty officers or in their respective military branches are eligible. After training, they will be employed from December.</p>
<h3>Number of Deaths From Cholera Among the Enemy</h3>
<p>Several Hundred Enemy Soldiers Have Died of Illness in Baoshan County; More Than Eight Hundred Enemy Soldiers Have Died Near Shanghai</p>
<p>According to a quick news report from this city on the 24th, a Japanese military spokesperson said that 200 Japanese soldiers in the Baoshan County area have died of cholera, and 300 more are currently suffering from the disease. However, according to private sources, approximately 800 Japanese soldiers in the Shanghai area have died of cholera in the past three weeks.</p>
<h3>Two Cases of Stray Bullet Injuries This Morning</h3>

<h3>The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees Subscribes to 300,000 Yuan of National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees has now decided to subscribe to 300,000 yuan of National Salvation Bonds. According to the person in charge of the Board, the Boxer Indemnity funds managed by the Board are used to allocate loans for productive undertakings such as railways and water conservancy, and the interest income is used to supplement various educational and cultural institutions. There are no other funds that can be used. However, during this time of national crisis, the Chinese and British directors are all enthusiastic about assisting the government in actively resisting the enemy. They have specifically agreed to withdraw half of the preparatory funds for sending students abroad and other self-run undertakings to subscribe to the bonds, in order to promote this cause.</p>

<h3>Enemy Planes Attacked Nanjing Five Times Yesterday</h3>
<p>A total of ninety-six aircraft　Dropped more than two hundred bombs　Our air force shot down five　Central News Agency　Central Broadcasting Station was destroyed</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Ninety-six enemy planes attacked Nanjing five times from 9:30 AM to 4:30 PM on the 25th. The first wave consisted of thirty-one planes, the second of thirty-two, the third of six, the fourth of twelve, and the fifth of fifteen. Only a small portion managed to penetrate the skies above Nanjing. When the first wave attacked, our air force immediately scrambled to intercept, resulting in fierce aerial combat over the outskirts of Nanjing. Although most of the enemy planes were repelled, a dozen or so still managed to penetrate Nanjing's airspace. Our anti-aircraft guns and artillery opened fire on the enemy planes, who still risked dropping bombs in various locations and strafing downward with machine guns. Explosions and gunfire erupted simultaneously, shaking the entire city. The Xiaguan Power Plant was bombed, and its machinery was slightly damaged. The alert was lifted at 10:30 AM. In this engagement, five enemy planes were shot down by our forces, mostly by anti-aircraft fire. One fighter plane crashed inside the courtyard of No. 27 Wangfu Garden in the south of the city. Two heavy bombers crashed in Xiaguan and caught fire and were completely destroyed. Two other planes were damaged and attempted to flee, one crashing and burning in Taixing, and the crash site of the other is still under investigation. The above describes the first attack. The second attack came at 12:30 PM at noon. Three bombs were dropped on the headquarters of the Central News Agency on Hongwu Road, completely destroying the building, injuring three workers. The Central Broadcasting Station outside Jiangdongmen was also bombed, and its equipment was destroyed. The alert was lifted at 1:20 PM. The third, fourth, and fifth attacks were shorter in duration because our air force interception and the fierce bombardment by air defense units resulted in fewer enemy planes penetrating than in the first two attacks. The targets of the enemy planes' multiple bombings on the 25th, in addition to the aforementioned Capital Power Plant, Central News Agency Headquarters, and Central Broadcasting Station, included the vicinity of the Ministry of Health's Central Hospital, a branch of the Sipaulou Health Office, Guangdong Hospital, and other charitable institutions. Among the shops and civilian houses destroyed were many buildings along Zhongshan Motor Company, Santiao Lane, Jiangdongmen, Jiankang Road, and the Bianying area of Mentung. Regarding the number of casualties, one person died and five were injured at the Health Affairs Branch, three died and six were injured at Guangdong Hospital, six died and more than ten were injured at Jiangdongmen, more than ten died and more than twenty were injured in Santiao Lane, and eight died and more than ten were injured at Bianying. The detailed figures are not yet available due to the late hour. The total number of bombs dropped by enemy planes on the 25th was over two hundred. The targets of the bombing were mostly cultural and health institutions and civilian residences. The dead and wounded were all civilians. The cruel and savage bestiality of the enemy troops was fully exposed, their disregard for humanity and violation of international law making them a public enemy of all mankind. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Broadcasting Station (XO&amp;A) built by the Central Broadcasting Administration, located in Jiangdongmen in the western suburbs of Nanjing, had a power of 75 kilowatts. During the enemy air raid on the 25th, its equipment was destroyed. It is now reported that the newly built Jinling Broadcasting Station of the department, callsign (ZGX), will begin broadcasting today, using the same wavelength of 660 kilocycles. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Zhenjiang] This area was under air raid alert all day on the 25th. No less than a hundred enemy planes passed through here on their way to Nanjing. They all flew at an altitude of over 5,000 feet. At around 5 PM, as the enemy planes were fleeing back from Nanjing, they encountered one of our transport ships on the Jiangzhu estuary at Twelve Forts. They suddenly flew low and dropped a bomb, which missed. Our ship opened fire, and the enemy plane escaped. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Ignoring the protests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, the Japanese military authorities dispatched twenty-nine aircraft again this morning to continue bombing Nanjing. As a result, the densely populated southern part of the city was targeted by enemy planes, which dropped many bombs. When the enemy planes approached, the anti-aircraft guns on the ground fired like a string of pearls, immediately shooting down three enemy planes. One of them caught fire and exploded in mid-air, one crashed in the southern part of the city, and one crashed in the northern district. The first air raid warning was issued at 9:02 AM. Ten minutes later, ten Chinese fighter planes took off to prepare for battle. The second warning was issued at 9:37 AM. Eighteen minutes later, fourteen Japanese planes were seen appearing in the Nanjing sky, approaching in a single file from the south, like a black dragon. After the Japanese planes reached the airspace above the southern part of the city, they swooped down to drop bombs. At that moment, one plane was hit by an extremely accurate anti-aircraft gun from the Chinese side and immediately caught fire, exploding into fragments in the air. The spectators on the ground temporarily forgot their dangerous situation and cheered and applauded to express their joy. The other enemy planes hurriedly dropped their bombs and then soared high into the clouds to hide. However, the trajectory of the anti-aircraft gun explosions in the air could still be used to discern the direction of the enemy planes' escape. But at this moment, another squadron of Japanese planes attacked, consisting of eleven bombers and four fighter planes, which flew in from the south along the original route to bomb the southern part of the city. Five minutes later, Chinese anti-aircraft guns hit another bomber, which crashed in the northern district. The other planes, seeing the situation was unfavorable, fled towards Xiaguan. The manager of Texaco, a Dane named Hansen, witnessed the entire aerial battle from a small hill next to the American Embassy. He said, "After the Japanese planes swooped down to drop bombs in the southern part of the city, the anti-aircraft guns fired upwards, with accuracy that could be described as unmatched. One shot hit one plane. I personally witnessed the plane that was hit, along with the undropped bombs inside, explode in mid-air, turning into thick smoke and flames that fell to the ground. In addition, one plane was also hit in Xiaguan during the second attack and exploded and crashed in the air. As for where the bombs fell, both the southern part of the city and Xiaguan were hit, but the area west of Zhongshan Road was not attacked." (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After the Japanese planes attacked twice this morning, an alarm was raised again at noon. At 12:50 PM, twenty-one enemy planes flew in from the east and dropped bombs densely. Some fell near the broadcasting station. The bomb explosions were very loud, and the doors and windows of the American Embassy were shaken. American Ambassador Johnson and his staff continued to work as usual. Six bombs fell in the central district of the city. There were reports that bombs also fell near the Customs Office of the Ministry of Finance. Foreigners who witnessed the events saw huge craters formed by the explosions, but no houses were seen to be damaged. When residents, believing the danger had passed, were leaving their shelters to have lunch, a large squadron of enemy planes flew in from the southeast and dropped many bombs near the waterworks and broadcasting station. It was 2:00 PM. This morning, two bombs fell near the Taikoo Dock in Xiaguan, and one bomb hit the building of the Jardine Matheson Timber Company, but there were no deaths or injuries in either location. The impact of the Japanese planes' attacks was merely to disrupt the residents' daily lives. The attacks today were clearly aimed at the waterworks and power plant. Although both suffered damage, the authorities are working hard to repair them so that they can be restored to their original state as soon as possible. A group of American photographers at the Yangtze River Hotel, about a hundred yards from the power plant, had a good opportunity today to film the enemy planes dropping and exploding bombs one by one, for a total of ten minutes. Six bombs fell within five hundred yards of the Reuters office. The building and the bomb shelter in the front yard both felt significant tremors. Three bombs exploded at the headquarters of the Central News Agency in T'usze Road, injuring three employees, two with minor injuries and one more seriously. The number of deaths and injuries today has not yet been determined. It is now believed that about a hundred civilians were killed or injured. According to an official from the Air Force Command, four enemy planes were shot down today, two crashing in Xiaguan, one in the southern part of the city, and one outside the South Gate. The shooting down of three planes was witnessed by people. Three fires broke out in the Zhongshan Road area of the southern part of the city due to the bombing, where many shops were located. The shooting down of enemy planes this morning was entirely due to the power of the anti-aircraft guns. The accuracy of the anti-aircraft guns was unexpectedly good. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Enemy planes attacked Nanjing twice on the morning of the 25th. During the second attack at 12:30 PM, three bombs were dropped on the headquarters of the Central News Agency at 12:40 PM, completely destroying the building and injuring five people. It has been confirmed that the Central News Agency is purely a cultural organization, and its location is in a densely populated area. The enemy planes' indiscriminate bombing is truly abhorrent to humanity. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Local news) Enemy planes flew to Nanjing and wreaked havoc yesterday, and five were shot down by our forces. According to the Allied News Agency, one of those killed was the enemy plane squadron leader, named Sakamoto. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The Central News Agency issued a circular stating: To all newspapers and readers everywhere, please note that our agency was subjected to enemy bombing this afternoon, with three bombs dropped, completely destroying the building and injuring several employees. This has caused obstacles to our work, resulting in slight delays in the release of news. We sincerely apologize. The enemy's barbaric act of wantonly bombing our cultural institutions has long been condemned by both Chinese and foreign countries. During this time of all-out resistance, our agency has also been destroyed, which we had long anticipated. Therefore, we had made some preparations elsewhere in advance. Although we have suffered this serious blow, we can still continue to supply news, which is sufficient to comfort the fervent hopes of the people of the country. As long as we have a breath of life, we will vow to follow our original intention, follow the lead of our colleagues across the country, and actively fight for national survival and the cause of peaceful culture. Respectfully, the Central News Agency Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Again Suffers Air Raids</h3>
<p>Our Air Force Intercepts and Repels Enemy　Enemy Ships Also Shell Haikou</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Enemy planes attacked Guangzhou at 0:30 AM on the 25th and were repelled by our planes in the suburbs. Three planes came again at 4:00 AM, but only one entered the city and dropped three bombs in Shou Gou Hill. At 11:00 AM, three planes came again from the Tangjiawan sea and attacked. They were intercepted by our planes in Whampoa, and two were damaged and escaped. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The movements of the enemy aircraft carriers in the Pearl River Estuary are extremely secret, changing several times a day. Two enemy aircraft carriers, two destroyers, and one patrol ship are stationed in the rocky sea forty miles from Hong Kong. Two enemy ships arrived at the islands of Da Chuan and Xiao Chuan near Hai Pao, Taishan County, on the 22nd to survey the waterways, seemingly intending to land troops. We are on high alert. Many residents of Hai Pao have come to Hong Kong to take refuge. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] At noon on the 25th, an enemy plane sneaked into the city and dropped a bomb. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] At 10:50 AM on the 25th, a squadron of enemy planes attacked Guangzhou. Our air force sent planes to intercept them in the sky near Humen. After a fierce battle lasting about twenty minutes, the enemy planes were overwhelmed and fled while fighting. They dropped several bombs near Humen, falling on the ocean and fields. One enemy plane still wanted to break into the city's airspace, but was relentlessly pursued by our planes and ultimately failed to reach the city's airspace. (Central Dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] At 10:00 AM on the 24th, two Japanese planes first flew in from the north and circled over the city of Haikou, reaching heights of over ten thousand feet, and dropped leaflets and many copies of the Taiwan New People's News, which mostly claimed enemy victories. Our defending troops did not fire on them because they were flying too high. Later, one plane flew to the western coast and scouted for a long time. At noon, an enemy ship suddenly sailed into port and opened fire on the shore. The enemy planes soared in the sky to indicate the target, but were afraid of being hit by our anti-aircraft guns and did not dare to fly low, dropping only a few bombs, all of which fell in the fields. Under the joint sea and air attack of the enemy, the defending troops of our artillery positions bravely returned fire and fought back fiercely. The sound of artillery rumbled for about an hour before the enemy ships and planes were repelled. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] At 11:25 PM on the 24th, an enemy plane sneaked into the airspace over Guangzhou and circled for about two hours without dropping any bombs before leaving. At 2:15 AM, another enemy plane returned to spy on the city, hovering at high altitude. After close surveillance by our air defense forces, the enemy plane did not drop any bombs and flew to the southeast at around 4:00 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] Houses collapsed in Guangzhou due to the bombing by enemy planes for several days. Tsang Yang-fu personally inspected the situation on the 23rd and 24th, and consoled the families of the dead and injured. He also sent personnel to visit the victims who were being treated in the hospital to express his concern. He expressed his utmost hatred for the brutal and inhumane Japanese militarists. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] It is reported that when enemy planes raided Guangzhou at night, traitors used rockets near the residences of German expatriates in the urban area as signals to aid the enemy. German Deputy Consul Dr. Kempe explained to the military and political authorities that this matter could easily cause misunderstandings and requested that it be strictly prohibited. He also expressed that the friendship between the German expatriates and the Chinese nation has not diminished in the slightest, and that they considered the traitors to be their personal enemies as well. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] At 7:00 AM this morning, a Japanese patrol ship and two planes bombed Haikou, the main port of Hainan Island. The patrol ship fired a total of twenty-one shots. Details of the damage are unknown. This morning, several Japanese planes attempted to bomb the Chinese small patrol boat at Ximenkou in Macau, but missed the target and destroyed many Chinese houses by the river, killing many people. The air raid alarm was issued in Guangzhou this morning probably because of this. In fact, the Japanese planes were not discovered in the Guangzhou sky at that time. At 1:10 PM, Japanese planes bombed many villages near the Humen fortresses. The number of deaths and injuries is not yet known, but it is feared that many people in rural areas have suffered.

<h3>Tragic Scenes of Wuhan Bombing</h3>
<p>Slums Become Fields of Rubble　Corpses Littered Everywhere, Rescue Overwhelmed</p>
<p>[Hankou] Enemy planes killed 511 people in Hankou on the 24th, with 22 dying in hospitals, 194 seriously injured, and 270 slightly injured. In Hanyang, 129 died, 156 were seriously injured, and 194 were slightly injured. In Wuchang, 2 died and 1 was injured. In total, 1,019 people were killed or injured. Aftercare is being rushed. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] The slum of Wu Jing Miao in Hankou, which was bombed yesterday, is even more desolate after another visit by Japanese bombers last night. Thousands of terrified and homeless women are scattered in the streets. Rescue workers, already exhausted, are still digging bodies from the rubble, some of whom are not dead, but are so severely injured and dismembered that they would rather be dead. A Reuters reporter saw a Chinese child, about ten years old, carrying his mother's corpse on his shoulders and placing it in front of the gatekeeper of the hospital, asking him to bury it. He then went to look for his missing younger siblings. The Reuters reporter then went to a small house and looked inside, seeing three men sitting upright as if alive. Upon closer inspection, they were all corpses, one of whom was still holding a dead child in his arms. The reporter also saw multiple corpses in one room of another house, while in another room, a woman was calmly preparing a meal, as if nothing had happened. However, it was reported that Chinese fighters shot down a Japanese plane 40 kilometers from Hankou yesterday. It is estimated that the Japanese planes flew at an altitude of about 2,000 feet yesterday. According to foreign experts, the Japanese planes must have been able to see the dense population of Wu Jing Miao and the absence of military targets. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] After experiencing the horror of death and destruction during yesterday afternoon's bombing, Japanese planes returned to Hankou last night and dropped more bombs. Last night's bombing lasted only ten minutes, but the destruction was very severe. All the doctors, paramedics, and nurses in Wuhan have now been urged by the authorities to serve, and the pain of the dead and wounded has been greatly reduced by the efforts of the Chinese Red Cross and the Methodist Hospital to provide relief and treatment. Due to insufficient electricity, most surgeries and amputations are performed by candlelight. The seriously injured have to be injected with morphine to reduce their pain. This morning, a section of land about two hundred feet long and five feet wide was found to have been completely destroyed by three direct hits. Relief work is still underway, and the rubble is being searched for corpses. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] After Japanese planes turned the slum area of Hankou into a field of rubble last night, a Reuters reporter went to inspect the disaster area. What he saw was a scene of extreme tragedy. The streets of the Wu Jing Miao (transliteration) district, only six feet wide, were lined with the homes of the poor, but now they are all rubble. Those who lived there and those who walked along the roads were buried in them. Limbs were scattered everywhere. Rescue teams were collecting and piling them up. Even more tragic, broken walls and ruined walls often had an arm or a leg hanging from them, which was chilling to see. The reporter stood on the side of the road for about ten minutes and saw more than one hundred and twenty heavily injured people carried past, some moaning in agony, and others already lifeless. Most heartbreaking was the ambulance full of injured and dead infants. The disaster area was filled with a mixture of dead and half-dead people, with most of the injured naked and bleeding from their wounds. There seemed to be more corpses of young children than adults, probably because the young children were mostly indoors when the Japanese planes wreaked havoc. Police, students, and business groups are working hard under extremely difficult conditions, digging out the injured from the rubble, and moving the corpses whenever they are found. Many students are still working on their tragic work late into the night, showing signs of fatigue, but not resting at all. The mayor and other important figures personally went to the scene to direct the relief efforts, and the order was well maintained. The fire of the power lines made the rescue more difficult. Although doctors and rescue workers were working non-stop, their numbers were too small, which was a major regret. The original population of Wu Jing Miao was 10,000, and there were no troops within several miles, while the military factory, which was clearly the target of the Japanese bombing, was at least four miles away. In addition to Hankou, Hanyang and Wuchang were also attacked. A bomb fell in Hanyang and hit a refugee camp, killing sixty people and injuring many others. Hundreds of injured people in the Hankou Church Hospital were almost destroyed by bombs. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>

When our garrison approached the shore, they opened fire with machine guns. The enemy, knowing that our defenses were very tight, fled immediately, but the enemy ships remained in place. Two warships have been discovered outside Luobo Port in Fukou, and this morning they have sailed downstream. However, a giant ship was discovered in the center of the river. After being inspected with a telescope, it appeared to be armored, but due to the heavy fog, it was difficult to confirm. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Youth and Students' Anti-War Movement Intensifies</h3>
<p>Student Federation Has Eight Million Members　Questions Reasons for Invasion of China</p>
<p>According to a certain evening paper, a foreigner who recently arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo stated that anti-war sentiment within Japan has been gradually rising. In particular, young students are leading the anti-war movement. This is a good sign that the Japanese people are gradually realizing that military force is not enough to conquer China. However, Japanese police authorities strictly prohibit the leakage of such information, making it difficult to investigate. What is currently known is that the central organization of the Japanese youth anti-war movement is comprised of university and high school students within Japan. Their student federation has a total of eight million members. Recently, they elected representatives to question the Tokyo government about the reasons for invading China. At that time, government officials were dispatched to respond, stating that the war against China was due to hundreds of Imperial Army soldiers stationed in China being killed by Chinese troops. Therefore, the government, to maintain Japan's dignity, must launch a large-scale offensive to force the Chinese army to submit. The student representatives were greatly dissatisfied with this response and immediately continued to question, saying that the Japanese army's casualties were only a few hundred, but now, abandoning all other avenues, hundreds of thousands of troops are being mobilized into dangerous territory. Is it truly necessary to send hundreds of thousands of people into danger because of the deaths of only a few hundred? The government representatives were unable to answer, and the meeting ended unhappily. However, the government already knows that young students are mostly clear-headed and cannot be motivated by war, nor can they be forced to be in the vanguard of combat. Therefore, recent conscription within the country has focused on middle-aged merchants. The method of conscription is implemented by the police using semi-coercive means, so small and medium-sized merchants are currently very panicked. In addition, trade with China has always been the only major customer for Japanese merchants. Since the start of the invasion of China, Japanese goods have been piling up like mountains, making it difficult to sell them off quickly. Therefore, the number of businesses collapsing as a result is increasing daily.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Japan Returning Home Successively</h3>
<p>[Xiamen] The British ship "Dilitihua" arrived in Xiamen on the 25th, carrying 1,400 overseas Chinese from Tokyo, Nagasaki, and Taiwan. According to overseas Chinese returning from Taiwan, Taiwan was originally still peaceful, but recently, 200,000 young Taiwanese men were forcibly conscripted into the military and sent to China to fight. The Taiwanese people were unwilling, businesses stopped, and farmers stopped farming, causing great chaos. There are still 40,000 overseas Chinese in Taiwan who are suffering from abuse. There are few ships, making it difficult to return. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>City Relief Association Invited Mei Lanfang to Broadcast Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Theatrical World Initiated It Voluntarily Zhou Xinfang and Others Participated</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Relief Association is housing no less than 30,000 refugees. As the war expands, more and more arrive one after another. As the weather gradually cools, the refugees need cotton clothing. At the same time, the cost of supplies is also substantial. A fundraising broadcast was previously held, with excellent results. Yesterday, the Theatrical Association once again initiated a fundraising drive, inviting Dr. Mei Lanfang and other famous actors such as Zhou Xinfang to broadcast special, wonderful programs on the city's Fuxing Radio Station to raise relief funds. The Relief Association specially sent Xu Caicheng, the director of the reception group, to oversee the collection of donations. It is reported that the broadcast raised over ten thousand yuan in donations. The detailed amount and the titles of the donors will be announced at the end. In addition, the association plans to hire photographers to take systematic photos of all its relief work, in order to expose to the world the suffering of the Chinese people caused by enemy invasion and to arouse sympathy.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Civilian Residential Areas, Causing Deep Impression of Pain Throughout England</h3>
<p>Daventry Radio Station Exceptionally Suspended Broadcasting　Terror in the Sky Arouses People's Hatred and Common Cause</p>
<p>The "China Press" reports that those in this city who listened to the British Daventry radio broadcast on the evening of September 23 were deeply moved. After reading the latest news of the tragic deaths and injuries caused by Japanese aircraft attacks on Guangzhou and Nanjing, the announcer paused and expressed his opinion, saying that listeners everywhere should feel the deepest sympathy for the families of the victims. All who know that British broadcasting procedures have always been conservative feel that this unprecedented action by the radio station is very meaningful. The detailed reports of the orderly bombing of Chinese cities by the Japanese air force must have caused a deep impression of pain in the hearts of the British people, especially since everyone recognizes that China has very few ways to retaliate against this bombing. Nanjing has prepared new-style anti-aircraft artillery teams and has also set up bomb shelters for civilians, arranging them very completely, which has reduced the damage. However, the number of casualties in that area is still large. As for Guangzhou, the rural population is larger than elsewhere. Apart from anti-aircraft artillery and defensive aircraft, no preparations have been made to protect civilians, so the tragedy of deaths and injuries is beyond description. According to travelers, many villages between Nanjing and Shanghai have been completely destroyed by aircraft, and Suzhou is now also encountering this kind of tragedy. The Japanese military's intention is to intimidate the people and prevent them from giving the government the united support necessary to continue the war of resistance. However, judging from the current situation, the terror in the sky has only strengthened the people's overall hatred of the enemy, which is not without clear evidence. It is now believed that the Japanese aircraft dropped a total of thirty tons of bombs during their recent attack on the capital. It is said that Japanese aircraft can drop fifty tons of bombs every day and for a long time. Thinking about the future seems frightening, but it is still questionable whether the Japanese aircraft can truly achieve their goals. If they ultimately fail to achieve them, then an even more serious question will arise: 'What will Japan do then?'</p>
<p>The "China Press" reports that Niu Men, an accountant for Jardine Matheson's steamship company on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, arrived in Shanghai by train from the capital yesterday. According to an interview with a "China Press" reporter, he arrived in Nanjing from Jiujiang at noon on the 20th. He witnessed the Japanese aircraft attack at Xiaguan and saw two bombs falling on Tiger Hill, missing their target. The enemy planes flew southwest of the city and dropped bombs. The enemy planes flew very high, about 10,000 feet above the ground, and seemed to focus on civilian residential areas, with military installations taking second place, obviously trying to avoid retaliation from the city's defense forces. The enemy planes flew very high, so it was difficult for China's anti-aircraft artillery to hit them. The bombs exploded about 6,000 feet above the ground, so the enemy planes still had room to maneuver. Chinese warships, the Tiger Hill fort, and various locations in the city fired many shots. In his view, the air defense of the capital was extremely complete, and there were also a large number of fighter planes. He saw many Chinese soldiers along the way, and their morale was very high. They were not slightly affected by the Japanese aircraft attacks. They were on the grass on the train station platform, not at all alarmed, all calmly holding their guns and waiting for orders. The Japanese aircraft's air raids seemed to only increase the soldiers' hatred of the enemy.</p>

<h3>Re-Examining Wartime Finance</h3>
<p>— Zhang Naiqi</p>
<p>"Finance is the lifeblood of the nation. It is not the private property of anyone. Financial institutions are the heart of the nation. They are not anyone's shops." This is something I have said before.</p>
<p>Based on this principle, I have requested that peacetime finance should consider the balance of international payments and national income, and not solely the profits and losses of the financial sector.</p>
<p>I now further request that wartime finance should not only consider the balance of international payments and national income, but also strengthen national power and cultivate the strength of the people.</p>
<p>Financial institutions are the center of the entire economic structure. The power of finance should be the leader of all economic activities. If finance tightens on one industry, that industry will often decline. If finance expands in one area, that area will often prosper. For example, if financial institutions had not expanded cotton mortgage lending in the past two years, there would not be an oversupply of cotton production this year. Furthermore, if financial institutions had been able to tighten on the metal industry in Shanghai and expand on the metal industry in Nanjing in the past two years, some of the metal industry's inventory could have been moved to Nanjing. We can benefit immensely simply by skillfully using expansion and contraction.</p>
<p>It is precisely by relying on this skillful use that finance can consider the nation's revenue and expenditure. Let me give an example to prove it. Two years ago, three Chinese shipping companies, unable to withstand the competition from three foreign shipping companies on the Yangtze River, entered into a business agreement with them. At that time, if our financial institutions had been able to provide the Chinese shipping companies with 50 million yuan in working capital, allowing them to continue competing, then when the Chinese shipping companies later lost 50 million yuan, the foreign shipping companies might have also lost 50 million yuan. As a result, although the financial institutions would have to eat 50 million yuan in bad debts, the foreign companies would have remitted 50 million yuan less in investment income from China. We would have gained 50 million yuan in our balance of international payments. Therefore, if you are thinking like a small shopkeeper, this cannot be done. But if you are thinking like a nation, this should be done.</p>
<p>How can we consider national income? If financial institutions lend 1 million yuan to foreign merchants to import a batch of consumables, foreign manufacturers will earn 100,000 yuan in profits from that. As a result, we increase the national income of others while decreasing our own national income. If we lend this 1 million yuan to Chinese manufacturers, allowing them to mobilize 10,000 people for production and earn 100,000 yuan in profits, we increase our own national income. We lend 100 yuan to mobilize a non-productive person to produce. As long as they can produce 101 yuan worth of value, the extra one yuan is national income.</p>
<p>Speaking of wartime finance, the task is naturally even higher. In peacetime, we can still think in terms of monetary figures, so we must consider the balance of international payments and national income. In wartime, we simply cannot think solely in terms of monetary figures, but must first consider the word "power." In peacetime, money can be turned into "power," but in wartime, money cannot necessarily be turned into "power." The coastal blockade is a problem. Distant water cannot quench a nearby fire is also a problem.</p>
<p>In order to put the word "power" first, wartime finance should, in terms of production, adhere to the principles of self-sufficiency, self-supply, and self-defense, accelerating the enrichment of national power and not simply calculating costs or profits. For example, we know that it is more cost-effective to import a certain commodity than to produce it ourselves. However, for the needs of national defense, we have no choice but to bite the bullet and encourage everyone to produce it. Like Germany, which uses extremely high costs to produce artificial rubber and coal-derived gasoline, we should emulate this in the sense of self-defense. Furthermore, some equipment is known to have no productive value. However, for the needs of national defense, we have no choice but to encourage everyone to equip it. Such as air defense facilities in various cities, whether public or private. As long as they can guarantee national power, we should accommodate funds and encourage everyone to do it, and we can no longer care about the productivity and security of this investment. It is absolutely impossible to fight a fire while calculating the cost of water, treat a disease while calculating the cost of medicine, and use a normal mindset to deal with an extraordinary period.</p>
<p>Secondly, in order to put the word "power" first, wartime finance should, in terms of manpower, adhere to the principle of "making every able-bodied man in the country worthy of being an able-bodied man" (see my article "On Wartime Finance" in this column on the 7th of this month), making the cultivation of the people's strength the main task and not simply calculating national income. In peacetime, lending 100 yuan to mobilize a person requires at least the hope that they will produce 101 yuan worth of value. In wartime, we would bite the bullet and do it even if they can only produce 98 yuan worth of value. The reason is to enable this person to support themselves, train themselves, and become a useful person in production. Although this is a loss in monetary figures, it is a gain in terms of cultivating the strength of the people, which is more meaningful than passive relief.</p>
<p>How can we implement this wartime finance principle? I still hope that everyone will put the entire national financial policy plan first, and not the issue of chips first. Because no one currently opposes increasing chips. The problem is only how to increase them in a way that passively prevents malignant inflation and actively achieves the goal of strengthening national power and cultivating the strength of the people. When designing the plan, we should firmly remember the four words "national defense center" and not just see the rise and fall of one area or the interests of one industry.</p>
<p>For example, when talking about Shanghai, everyone naturally feels that the unemployment problem is very serious. But to solve the unemployment problem in Shanghai, the palliative solution is only to provide relief, and the fundamental solution is only to find a way in the interior. In the sense of national defense, it would be absolutely wrong and impossible to expand in Shanghai again to create a comprador-like, false prosperity to solve the unemployment problem. We can only tighten in Shanghai and expand in the interior, forcing many industrialists and businessmen to migrate to the interior. At the same time, with the financial circulation in the interior, it will be easier for the unemployed in Shanghai to solve their livelihood problems when they go to the interior.</p>
<p>When expanding to the interior, in terms of industry, we must naturally prioritize the restoration of factory production and mining operations, accelerate the promotion of handicrafts, and at the same time carry out the "industrialization of light industry by families" to accommodate a portion of the unemployed workers. Heavy industrial construction must naturally be done by finding ways to do it when there is no way to do it, to establish a foundation of self-sufficiency. In terms of agriculture, first, we should naturally pay attention to the collection of grain to consolidate national defense. Other mortgages can be done in moderation to maintain the livelihood of farmers. But the people who grow cotton will suffer a big loss this year, which is already a settled matter. We can only settle accounts with those who advocate Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. We must also strive to open up wasteland and increase arable land to accommodate another portion of the unemployed. In addition, we should also encourage cultural and educational undertakings in the interior as much as possible so that intellectuals and young people who go to the interior do not suffer from the depression of unemployment and schoollessness. This is our spiritual national defense, which cannot be neglected. Currently, domestic loans have gradually been promoted, and the relocation of cultural institutions has also begun to be implemented. Moreover, I have heard that the government will further adjust agricultural production and trade. I believe that more facts will be revealed in a short period of time to comfort the nation's hopes.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that everyone will not be pessimistic about our wartime economy at all. I dare say that our wartime economy will be "the rising sun in the east" and the enemy's wartime economy will be "the sun setting in the west." As we take advantage of the war's opportunity, we can throw the comprador economy and the slave economy of peacetime into the vast ocean and stride into the path of a national economy. We have unlimited manpower to mobilize and unlimited resources to develop. As long as we use the now-invigorated people's hearts and mobilize the already-concentrated financial power to develop these unlimited resources, every day will be a better day. A step forward is a step towards brightness. And the enemy? Their peacetime economy has already reached its limits, forcing them to resort to an aggressive military speculation. Their resources are inherently scarce, and the conscription of able-bodied men will cause the production system to tend to collapse. The last signs of the collapse of their wartime economy, which is a mere flash in the pan, are already showing.</p>
<p>We must endure the current pain. This is the suffering that mothers should endure before and after infants are born on land. A great new era has already unfolded politically. Let us also usher in a great new era economically. We must stop the bleeding and strive forward. The final victory will surely be ours.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Great Power Prestige, US Attitude Becomes Tougher</h3>
<p>Navy in China Decides Not to Withdraw　Duty-Bound, No Turning Back</p>
<p>[Washington] The US government's attitude toward the Sino-Japanese war has become tougher today. Although the State Department has not directly expressed support for China's request for assistance, its attitude has changed significantly based on the following two events: ㊀ The US Navy Department declared that its navy has decided to implement its policy of protecting overseas Chinese at all costs, and ㊁ The State Department lodged a serious protest with Tokyo on Wednesday against the Japanese bombing of cities and civilians. More importantly, when stating its position, the US Navy Department explicitly stated that the US Navy would not accept advice to withdraw from dangerous areas. However, the State Department's attitude toward the European countries' suggestion of invoking the Nine-Power Treaty to convene an international conference remains extremely lukewarm. (24th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] The US State Department announced today that the government has instructed the US Asian Fleet to remain in its current area and not withdraw, regardless of the stage of the Sino-Japanese war. If the US fleet were to withdraw from the Chinese coast at this time, it would greatly damage the US's prestige. However, if the US Navy adopts a policy of not withdrawing from the Chinese coast, it will inevitably suffer a great deal of danger. According to the State Department, "This kind of danger is of course unavoidable." Because the implementation of this policy is the obligation and great duty of the United States.

<h3>US Asian Fleet Commander Issues Proclamation by Radio</h3>
<p>[Washington] According to the Navy Department's announcement today, as long as the Sino-Japanese war exists, the US Asian Fleet will remain in Chinese territorial waters. This announcement was made by Admiral Yarnell, commander of the Asian Fleet, after a meeting of the Naval Staff. It stated that the Navy's original policy of stationing warships in various ports where US overseas Chinese need protection will continue to exist even after the US overseas Chinese have been warned to leave China and given the opportunity to leave. Most US overseas Chinese currently remaining in China have businesses that support their livelihoods. Therefore, they are unwilling to give up lightly unless their businesses are destroyed or their bodies are harmed. Even at that time, the US Navy cannot withdraw and abandon its duty, affecting the honor of the US Navy. It is heard that the above order was broadcast to the Asian Fleet by Admiral Yarnell from the flagship "Augusta" stationed in Shanghai on the 22nd, and the code used was a clear code, intended to allow Japanese radio stations to receive it and not lose the true meaning of the US government.

<h3>Japanese Planes Illegally Indiscriminate Bombings, England Lodges Another Protest to Japan</h3>
<p>Violating Promises, Cruel, Inhuman　Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs' Reply Still Ambiguous　International Peace Groups Ask for Sanctions</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the bombing of non-military targets in various parts of China by Japanese aircraft, Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to Japan, was recently ordered to protest to the Tokyo government, stating that the British people were deeply outraged by the recent bombings of Nanjing and Guangzhou by Japanese aircraft, which resulted in the tragic deaths of a large number of civilians. In addition, Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen also explained to Foreign Minister Hirota that the reply submitted by Japan regarding the attack on Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen had provided assurances that it would respect the safety of ordinary people, but the recent bombing actions were completely contrary to this promise and should be brought to the attention of the Japanese government. The British protest has been sent to the US government for review. (Central News Agency 24th Havas)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs has replied to the British protest regarding the bombings of Nanjing and Guangzhou on Wednesday. It is reported that he stated to the British Ambassador to Japan that they would be extra cautious in the future. (Central News Agency 25th Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] Two hundred and fifty organizations related to the international peace movement received letters this morning from the British headquarters of this movement, requesting an immediate meeting to pass a resolution urging the British government to take action under the League of Nations to stop the cruel killing by Japanese aircraft in China. The British branch of the movement has appealed to the international headquarters to make the other forty-three countries take the same action. At the same time, it is heard that the Adelaide Trades and Labor Council, representing the trade unions of South Australia, has passed a resolution urging a boycott of Japanese goods and asking the Australian Council of Trade Unions to take the same action throughout Australia. A "Morning Post" correspondent in Calcutta, India, cabled that since Japanese merchant ships have been requisitioned by the government for military use, Indian shipping companies have seen a great development in their business and have made considerable profits. Japanese imports have also greatly decreased, and the prices of Japanese goods have therefore risen. Indian native products have therefore benefited greatly. (Central News Agency 25th Reuters)</p>

<h3>European and American Public Opinion in Uproar</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops' Willful Slaughter Disgraces World Civilization</p>
<p>[Geneva] The repeated and indiscriminate bombing of our nation's capital by enemy aircraft has deeply shocked European public opinion. Major European newspapers have successively published photographs of innocent civilians tragically bombed by Japanese planes. Some newspapers have even denounced Japan as the "destroyer of 20th-century culture." Since the outbreak of this war, European sentiment and the attitude of various newspapers have been markedly different from 1932, especially among opposition newspapers in various countries. Since the Japanese bombing of Nanjing, they have gradually expressed dissatisfaction with Japan. For example, France's Le Matin and Le Journal, and Britain's Daily Mail and Morning Post. Some institutions with a strong sense of humanitarianism have also petitioned their governments to take effective measures or organize propaganda agencies to expose Japan's atrocities. For example, the International Federation of League of Nations Societies recently issued a declaration urging people to act according to their conscience, support China, and uphold international justice. International organizations in Geneva generally believe that each time Japan bombs innocent civilians, the world's opposition to Japan becomes more resolute. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Japanese aircraft's rampage and the bombing of innocent civilians, the Morning Post stated today that Britain's recent protest to Japan fully reflects humanity's widespread horror and disgust. For what is being endangered today is not only the lives, property, and interests of foreigners, but also the fundamental conditions of civilization. Regardless of the right or wrong of Japan's position in the Sino-Japanese War, the indiscriminate use of terror tactics will never gain world sympathy. We do not believe that this kind of brutality is endorsed or condoned by the majority of the Japanese people, for the Japanese nation's chivalry and human feelings are no less than those of the people of other countries. In reality, it seems that there is a small, powerful, and bellicose faction within the Japanese nation that has suddenly gone mad and cannot be restrained. We believe that if the Japanese people knew of this brutality being carried out in their name by these madmen, they would surely oppose it as much as outside critics do. What we hope for is that the Japanese people can understand this soon and immediately find a way to stop it, so that the nation's honor will not fall to an irreparable degree in the eyes of the world. Other newspapers of the Liberal and Labour parties continue to advocate economic sanctions against Japan. The News Chronicle stated, "Telegrams, telephone calls, and letters expressing disgust at Japan's slaughter of non-combatants have been constantly arriving at our office." The newspaper also advocated boycotting Japanese goods, saying, "Japan's economy depends entirely on the commercial goodwill of the world, so boycotting Japanese goods is the only way to awaken Tokyo." The Daily Herald stated, "The entire civilized world has yesterday unanimously and vehemently expressed its dismay at the Japanese air raids on Chinese cities and its contempt for those who issued the order. If economic sanctions are not implemented, the slaughter will never end." The newspaper further stated that economic pressure has become inevitable, and a meeting should be convened today to discuss how to implement it. The countries that should bear direct responsibility are Britain and the United States. The strength of these two countries is so great that they can stop the war without the participation of other countries. If Britain and the United States unite and do not buy Japanese cotton textiles and do not sell gasoline, iron, cotton, rubber, and machinery, it would be enough to make Japan yield. (Central News Agency dispatch from London, 25th)</p>
<p>[London] The National Club of the British Trades Union Congress recently sent an official letter to Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, stating, "The Japanese air force is wantonly bombing defenseless women and children in Guangzhou and other cities. This kind of destructive act of life is extremely heinous. Public opinion in all democratic and civilized countries deeply hates and detests it. We are also extremely indignant upon hearing the news. We hereby ask Your Excellency to convey our sincere condolences to your government and nation. Regarding this barbaric act of Japanese aircraft and the country's unprovoked war of aggression, we would be happy to participate if we can raise this protest in an effective manner. This letter has been sent to the Japanese Ambassador to Britain for his information," and so on. (Havas dispatch, 24th, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Consultative Committee; Japan Refuses to Participate</h3>
<p>Suggestion to Convene Far East Conference, Britain and France Express Support</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the League of Nations General Assembly's 23-nation Consultative Committee's invitation to Japan to participate in the Sino-Japanese issue, League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol has recently received a reply from the Japanese government, expressing its refusal to participate. The reply stated, "The intention of the Japanese government is to promote cooperation between China and Japan to maintain peace in Asia. However, the Chinese government has consistently adopted an anti-Japanese attitude and has encouraged anti-Japanese agitation and provocative actions. The Japanese government believes that the solution to the Sino-Japanese issue should be sought between China and Japan. Therefore, the Japanese government believes that there is no reason to change its current attitude toward the political activities of the League of Nations. Therefore, the Japanese government cannot accept the invitation of the Consultative Committee, which it regrets." (Havas dispatch, 25th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Geneva] According to news here, China is currently planning to take advantage of the indignation expressed by Britain and the United States at the Japanese bombing of Chinese cities to request that the League of Nations Consultative Committee, which will open on Monday, take appropriate countermeasures against Japan. Mr. Gu Weijun, China's chief representative to the League of Nations, refused to express his opinion on what these countermeasures might be. Mr. Gu only stated that the protests of Britain and the United States against Japan have now strengthened China's position. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Britain, France, and Australia have all unanimously supported the convening of a Far East Conference. Soviet Russia has also indicated that it does not oppose it. China has also agreed to it under certain conditions. However, all countries believe that the conference is doomed without the participation of the United States. If the United States has a positive response to this, the League of Nations Consultative Committee, which will meet on Monday, should be able to draft a public announcement because the committee is composed of 23 countries, including the United States. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>[London] The Executive Committee of the British League of Nations Union recently submitted a resolution to the government, stating, "We firmly believe that the government will do everything possible to ensure that the League of Nations General Assembly's Consultative Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue determines where responsibility lies for the current war in China. If the committee decides that this responsibility should be borne by Japan, we request that the government publicly issue a declaration stating, "The British government is prepared to fulfill all the obligations stipulated by the League of Nations Covenant. The British government is prepared to participate in any measures that can effectively stop Japanese aggression, provided that a sufficient number of other countries come forward to participate so that it can have a practical effect. The British government also believes that the best method is for all relevant countries to unanimously refuse the import of Japanese goods as a boycott," and so on.

<h3>New Dispute Between Japan and the Soviet Union Over Sakhalin Oil Extraction</h3>
<p>Japanese Businesses Deliberately Violate Contracts; Large Numbers of Russian Workers Dismissed</p>
<p>[Moscow] According to reports from Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky, Japanese businessmen who have the right to mine coal and extract oil there have recently repeatedly and openly violated Soviet law. Most recently, they have openly violated the provisions of the concession contract, proving that these businessmen are clearly following a secret plan of some party in Japan to intentionally aggravate Soviet-Japanese relations. Therefore, local authorities and public organizations are extremely indignant.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1937, the Heavy Industry Committee, at the request of the Japanese oil concessionaires, gathered approximately 2,000 Soviet workers and sent them to Vladivostok. The businessmen should have immediately transported this group of workers to Sakhalin to work, but they not only did not do so, but instead made a number of unreasonable demands, claiming that if the Soviet side did not agree, they could not continue to transport the group of workers to Sakhalin. As a result, the workers were idle in Vladivostok for three months until the Soviet side resolutely demanded that they be sent to the island in mid-August.</p>
<p>As of early September, the Japanese businessmen suddenly began to dismiss a large number of Soviet workers whom they had voluntarily hired, and prepared to dismiss as many as 2,500 more in the near future. The reason given was that they were preparing to reduce the scope of work and completely stop exploration work indefinitely. However, the businessmen had originally vigorously requested to extend the Sakhalin oil extraction rights to five years, and the Soviet government, at the request of the Japanese government, had agreed to this last year. Furthermore, a few months ago, the businessmen had announced that they would greatly expand their oil extraction operations and had therefore requested the Soviet side to recruit a large number of workers on their behalf.</p>
<p>At the same time, Japanese businessmen who have the right to mine coal have also actually begun to dismiss a large number of workers. It is said that 1,500 people will be dismissed in September, leaving only 150 people in the entire area during the winter, which is actually equivalent to completely stopping work. These businessmen's actions are in complete violation of the concession contract, which stipulates that the Japanese side cannot unilaterally decide to reduce or suspend the work of the concession business. According to the local agency of the Heavy Industry Committee, these businessmen's actions will cause the Soviet side to suffer huge material losses.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese side's explanation to local officials, these illegal and suspicious actions are due to the fact that their work has encountered obstacles. This reason is clearly a fabrication, because in reality they can carry out legitimate work as long as their actions do not go beyond Soviet law and the concession contract. It is speculated that the real reason for these sudden actions by the businessmen is probably that since the start of the Japanese invasion of China, they have encountered great difficulties in finance, transportation, and other areas. Now, local agencies and trade unions are very indignant at these illegal actions and have asked the government to take necessary measures to protect Soviet interests and hope that the Heavy Industry Committee will stop the concessionaires from violating the contract and issue a serious warning. At the same time, local authorities also believe that all losses caused by the reduction in production should be claimed from the Japanese businessmen. (TASS dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Detained Japanese Fishing Boats Successively Released by the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Fined for Violating Territorial Waters</p>
<p>⊙ Keijo, since the first ten days of June, all fishing boats departing from Korea to fish in the coastal waters of the Maritime Province have been detained by the Soviet side in the Port of De Castries, totaling as many as 70 boats. The reason for the detention was suspicion of violating territorial waters. All were brought to trial and each was sentenced to pay a fine of several hundred yuan. After the Japanese Consulate General in Vladivostok guaranteed the release of the boats, the fines were paid and the boats were successively released. Thus, the detention of Japanese fishing boats, which had been a major incident for a time, has come to an end. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Cooperation Needed Between Chinese and Foreign Groups for Rescuing Wounded Soldiers and Refugees</h3>
<p>International Red Cross Special Envoy Advocates for Material Assistance from Allied European and American Nations</p>
<p>Continental Daily reports: According to Colonel Walter Ville, Special Envoy of the International Committee of the Red Cross, he told a Continental Daily reporter yesterday that he is currently conducting an investigation in Shanghai. If he finds that the Chinese Red Cross Society truly needs assistance to rescue Chinese wounded soldiers and refugees in the war zone, friendly nations in Europe and America will definitely provide substantial material assistance. The Colonel arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday to investigate the work of the Chinese Red Cross Society. Another important mission is to determine whether the belligerent countries are complying with the letter and spirit of the Red Cross rules, maintaining neutrality and avoiding harm. He will report on these matters in detail to the International Committee, hoping that the committee will provide material and moral support to the Chinese Red Cross Society. The Colonel will soon go to the capital and then north to investigate the work of the Red Cross Society in North China. The Colonel also stated that it is the established practice of the International Committee to send personnel to investigate whenever a war breaks out in a region. Based on the results of its investigations, the committee has sent medical teams, doctors, medicines, and funds to assist Spain and Abyssinia. The Colonel's main task in Shanghai is to determine how Geneva can assist the Chinese Red Cross Society. If it is determined that assistance is urgently needed, the Red Cross societies of European and American countries listed in the International Committee may be requested to transport medicines and supplies to China to assist the work of the Red Cross Society. After arriving in Shanghai, the Colonel immediately inspected the local hospitals, including those temporarily established. He was very pleased with the hard work and orderly service of the hospital staff. During this inspection, the Colonel felt that one of the most important things at present is to work together, especially when Chinese and foreign groups are working together. The Colonel said that in the important work of relieving refugees and wounded soldiers, one must not waste time or energy. The Colonel is also investigating the attack on the Chinese Red Cross rescue team by the Japanese army and the bombing by bombs. He said that the work of the Red Cross Society is based on not being attacked. During the investigation, he will strive to ensure that the warring parties abide by the international treaties of the Red Cross.</p>

<h3>Central Price of Autumn Cocoons in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Fresh cocoons priced at 40 yuan per picul, 70% cash, 30% on account</p>
<p>Autumn cocoons in Zhejiang Province have already begun to enter the market. During this extraordinary period, silk manufacturers and cocoon merchants are unable to purchase them, especially those in Shanghai. Although the Provincial Sericulture Control Committee has made great efforts to encourage them, it has ultimately been ineffective. To help silkworm farmers, it has been decided to organize the 1937 Autumn Cocoon Purchase Management Committee, which will use the 8.5 million yuan autumn cocoon loan from the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China) to purchase cocoons itself. The guaranteed price for autumn cocoons is set at 40 yuan per picul of fresh cocoons in national currency. However, only 70% of the payment will be made in cash at the time of purchase, with the remaining 30% recorded as an account receivable. If there is a surplus after the silk is reeled and sold, the account receivable will be paid accordingly; otherwise, it will not be paid. However, silk manufacturers can also purchase autumn cocoons according to the above method.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange National Debt Account to be Settled at Limited Price</h3>
<p>Accounts totaling over 100 million, with margin deposits over 10 million, proposed to be settled once at the Ministry of Finance's limited price</p>
<p>Since the stock exchange was closed due to the current situation, the large amount of national debt chips could not be traded. At that time, due to the scattering of customers, forward transactions could not be delivered on time. Therefore, a temporary expedient was adopted to transfer the August transactions to the September period with an interest subsidy of one percent. However, this method did not satisfy the money lenders. Later, although the exchange and the brokers' association once made a resolution to announce it, this method clearly contradicted the law and economics, and was opposed by the money lenders. According to experienced figures in the banking industry, to solve the problem once and for all, it is necessary to settle the national debt accounts at the Ministry of Finance's limited price. In fact, there is no hope of reopening the stock exchange in the short term, and it is impossible to postpone the settlement of this huge account of over 100 million yuan indefinitely. Moreover, the margin deposits placed by the exchange amount to over 10 million yuan. During this long period of resistance war, the funds cannot be left idle, which is inconvenient for both public and private reasons. Therefore, the exchange's brokers' association has also accepted the suggestion and convened a general meeting. On the 24th, it was resolved to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance, requesting it to order the board of directors to settle all transactions at the limited price to clear the procedures for both parties. Settlement at the limited price is the most appropriate way to resolve various disputes in the future. Apart from the exchange, there are no major problems. However, the outcome depends on the Ministry of Finance's approval.</p>

Yesterday morning, he and his wife went to Hong En Hospital to visit British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. According to consulate staff, Sir Hughe will leave China and go south at the beginning of next month. The original itinerary was to go to Hong Kong first, but because the climate in Manila is more suitable for the patient, he will go there for about two months of recuperation before deciding on the itinerary. The Ambassador's injuries have been improving recently and he will soon recover. All parties are very pleased to hear this. It is also reported that Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, British Ambassador to China, who was injured by a Japanese aircraft, has been treated at Hong En Hospital on Great Western Road for many days and has now recovered.

<h3>Enemy Airfield Catches Fire After Being Hit</h3>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reports that last night, when our brave air force came to Shanghai to bomb the enemy's positions, it was heard that two bombs hit the enemy's airfield near the Gongda Yarn Factory, causing a fire. Three aircraft were burned on the spot, and the ammunition depot was also affected, so the enemy's losses were extremely heavy.</p>
<h3>Enemy Transport Ships Unload Munitions</h3>
<p>In recent days, the transport ships carrying the enemy's fourth reinforcements to Shanghai have gradually sailed back to Japan in the past two days. The remaining ones in the port are all four ships that came to transport munitions and military supplies. Two are docked at the Huangpu Wharf, namely the Sixth Unkai Maru and the Wuling Maru. One is docked at the Osaka Wharf, namely the Chikugo Maru. One is docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf, namely the Wanguang Maru.

Many trucks were parked at each wharf, and they were busy moving back and forth.</p>
<h3>Enemy Arrives with Hundreds of Military Vehicles</h3>

<h3>The Enemy Intends to Land at Pudong Urgently; Intense Artillery Battles Ensue</h3>
<p>Artillery fire has not ceased from yesterday until noon today. Enemy boats approached the Chunjiang Wharf but were repelled. Our heavy artillery bombarded enemy positions, causing significant damage.</p>
<p>Following several failed attempts to infiltrate Pudong, rumors of a large-scale enemy offensive have been circulating for the past few days. However, under the watchful guard of our troops, no drastic action has occurred until yesterday morning. From the Mitsubishi Wharf along the Pudong riverfront to the end of Yangshupu, the number of enemy ships suddenly increased. Besides transport ships and Red Cross vessels, there were over twenty warships gathered along the riverfront, stretching for about ten miles. All their gun emplacements were pointed towards Pudong. Upon receiving this information, our troops issued an order to the entire front line along the river,</p>
<p>Awaiting in Full Battle Array.</p>
<p>The situation immediately became extremely tense. Subsequently, after noon, enemy ships fired intermittently. Around 3 PM, thirteen enemy aircraft arrived in formation and wreaked havoc over the areas of Qichang Depot, Shiba Jian, Yangjing, Zhangjialou, Yangjiadu, Shenjia Nong, and Pudong Avenue, repeatedly bombing these locations. By 6 PM in the evening, it was estimated that no fewer than seventy or eighty bombs had been dropped. Most of the bombs fell in the fields, causing little damage except for a few houses that were affected and destroyed. At the same time, starting from 4 PM, enemy ships also began to</p>
<p>Open Fire and Bombard</p>
<p>It was estimated that a shell was fired every minute, continuing for about one hundred and several dozen rounds until the artillery fire became sparse around 6 PM in the evening, ceasing entirely at 7:15 PM. After a silence of about four hours, around 11 PM, our air force launched a night raid on Shanghai. The enemy ships, in a state of panic, fired wildly with anti-aircraft guns and machine guns. Fearing a pincer attack by our Pudong garrison, they resumed heavy bombardment with their artillery. Our positions, seeing that the time had come, responded with heavy artillery fire,</p>
<p>Resounding Through the Sky.</p>
<p>Houses were shaken by the impact. Our artillery shells landed in the enemy positions around Yangshupu. The intensity of the artillery battle was the first of its kind since the start of the Pudong conflict. Around midnight, four enemy boats, filled with sixty to seventy Japanese soldiers, approached the Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong under heavy artillery fire. The enemy opened fire, spraying the shore with machine guns. Simultaneously, two enemy warships also assisted with heavy machine gun fire. The machine gunners defending the dock entrance displayed remarkable skill, defending against both the warships and enemy boats while</p>
<p>Vigorously Returning Fire.</p>
<p>This made it exceedingly difficult for the enemy soldiers to advance. After about ten minutes of engagement, the enemy soldiers suffered casualties and were forced to retreat. Seeing their failure, the enemy ships reduced their artillery fire. Around 1 AM, when our air force returned to bomb again, the enemy ships densely bombarded Pudong once more. Our artillery also returned fire. The rumbling sounds continued until around 2 AM, after which the artillery fire became sporadic. Around 4 AM, intense artillery battles resumed. The enemy ships targeted our rear ×× positions. The intense fighting continued until around 5 AM, when two enemy boats again approached the Chunjiang Wharf in an attempt to</p>
<p>Launch a Second Sneak Attack.</p>
<p>Our troops continued to use machine guns to fire, the sound of gunfire exceptionally crisp. The enemy boats, realizing that our defenses were strong and difficult to breach, quickly fled under the intense pressure of our gunfire. However, the enemy warships continued their heavy bombardment until 6:30 AM, when it finally ceased. After this night of intense fighting in Pudong, our reporter set out to investigate at 8 AM this morning and found that the houses along the Pudong area were still intact, because the enemy ships' shells,</p>
<p>Devoid of Targets,</p>
<p>Some two to three hundred shells in total, all fell in the fields bordering ××. Our troops suffered no casualties. However, during the enemy aircraft bombing yesterday evening, four farmers harvesting rice near Maojia Zhai were killed and one was injured. Zhang Zhang, a woman, and Pu Mingming, a man, were injured in Zhangjialou, but their lives are not in danger. Also, around 11 AM this morning, enemy ships again opened fire on our Pudong positions, but since they had no targets, our side suffered no losses. The enemy's victory spin has also stopped.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Slaughter Chinese Civilians; Anti-Japanese Movement Flourishes in Britain and France</h3>
<p>South Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Decides to Boycott Japanese Goods. Ambassador Wang Sends Note to the U.S. Government Listing Japanese Atrocities.</p>
<p>[London] Since Japanese aircraft recklessly bombed and massacred civilians in China, an anti-Japanese movement has sprung up in England, rapidly gaining momentum. Today, the National Peace Council of England and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, following the reports of other groups, passed resolutions protesting against Japan. The National Peace Council stated that the bombing of Guangzhou was "an act of extreme terror and horror" and lodged a protest with the Japanese Embassy in London. The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom has also sent a letter to the embassy, as well as a letter to Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and Under-Secretary Cranborne, urging the British government to pressure the Japanese government to stop the "massacre" and requesting that the British representative to the League of Nations make every effort to ensure that the League's Advisory Committee immediately consider Japan's bombing actions.

<p>⊙ Adelaide, Australia. The Adelaide Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Australia, angered by the brutality of the Japanese army in China, has decided to boycott Japanese goods as a protest against Japan. Adelaide, located in southeastern Australia, is the capital of South Australia and has extensive trade with Japan.

<p>[Paris] The World Peace Congress opened here today. The chairman was the French Minister of Aviation, Pierre Cot. Seated around him were the Secretary-General of the Congress, Mr. Guéhenno, the representative of the Chinese branch of the Peace Congress, General Yang Hucheng, former pacification commissioner of Shaanxi province, Dr. Atkinson, Secretary-General of the Federation of Churches of New York, Mr. Stonehouse, Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labour, and many other important figures from various countries. General Yang Hucheng delivered a brief speech, reporting on the situation in China, stating that the country is a unified, democratic nation, now united in resisting Japanese aggression. "Japan's ambition does not stop at conquering China. Therefore, if China can defeat Japan, it will be the best guarantee for peace in the Far East and Europe." Chairman Cot, on behalf of the Congress, expressed sympathy to China and asked Mr. Yang to convey to the Chinese people that the French have no animosity towards Japan, but since Japan is now engaged in acts of aggression, it is naturally spurned by the French. Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Stonehouse spoke in succession, also stating that the situation in the Far East is extremely serious and advocating for strong collective action to deal with Japan. (Central News Agency, 25th, Havas) ⊙ Lille, France After the houses of the French Catholic "Jesuit Society" in Xianxian County, Hebei Province, China, were bombed by Japanese aircraft yesterday, the authorities of the "Jesuit Society" here issued a public statement stating, "The area is densely populated, and the Japanese aircraft dropped as many as thirty bombs. The extent of the damage can be imagined. Our clergy have suffered this disaster, and we cannot stand idly by." (Central News Agency, 25th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Ambassador Dr. Wang Zhengting recently sent a note to the U.S. State Department listing the atrocities of the Japanese army. The full text is quite long, but it states in brief that Japan has inflicted cruelty on innocent Chinese civilians, patients, and wounded soldiers, even using poison gas, disregarding humanity. All the basic principles of international law have been completely destroyed. "Its crimes are so heinous that it is difficult to find appropriate words to condemn them." Chinese envoys to other countries will also send similar notes to their respective governments. Ambassador Wang also made a statement to the press, saying that the U.S. government had protested to Japan regarding the bombing of Chinese cities. The purpose of the note submitted by the Chinese government today is to increase the strength of the U.S. government's protest. However, he has not received orders from the government to request the U.S. government to protest again, as this is a matter for the U.S. government and not for outsiders to interfere with. He also has not been ordered to invoke the Nine-Power Treaty. When reporters asked him what he thought of the statement issued yesterday by U.S. Asia Fleet Commander Admiral Yarnell, Ambassador Wang replied that it was "wise".

<h3>Trivial Commentary</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>"Those with money contribute money; those with strength contribute strength." This is the most powerful expression of joining together to face national crisis. However, the definition of the three words "those with money" is the most difficult to define properly. If you say he has money, he will never admit it. If you say he has no money, he clearly has money. Even if he admits that he has money, he will still compare himself with others to show that he is not as wealthy as they are. This mentality cannot be said to be completely inappropriate, but it does have an impact on the "contributing money" aspect.</p>
<p>Therefore, the contribution of money by those with money also requires enthusiastic individuals among the wealthy to promote it, so that it can achieve the greatest effect. If the following types of people can come forward to promote the purchase of national salvation bonds, the effect will be much greater than sporadic solicitations like sesame seeds.</p>
<p>㊀ People who have made huge profits from speculation in gold bars, yarn, flour, and wheat in the past three years.</p>
<p>㊁ Wealthy people who hoard gold and silver and store foreign currency.</p>
<p>㊂ Ladies who live extravagantly, indulging in the enjoyment of human blessings, and are unaware of the hardships of the poor.</p>
<p>As long as they can be motivated, very huge and considerable numbers can be obtained. In today's society, if more people like Que Gu, Yu Sou Xian Gao, and Bu Shi are produced, I think people will only respect and sympathize with them. No one will dare to privately criticize them, nor will thieves be tempted. Moreover, they can get rewards from the national government, and they can recover both principal and interest in full when the bonds mature. There is probably no better way to achieve both fame and fortune in the world than this.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Overseas Chinese Return from Japan</h3>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai Today on the Xinjiang Steamer; Over Three Hundred Natives of Ningbo Will Return Home on the Same Ship</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, there have been many instances of overseas Chinese returning from Japan. It is now learned that the Xinjiang steamer, which arrived in Shanghai this afternoon, also carries more than a thousand overseas Chinese, of whom more than three hundred are natives of Ningbo. The Ningbo Natives Association in Shanghai received a telegram from Gu Ruibao of the Sanjiang Public Association in Japan yesterday, so it has appointed Dong Xinqin and other executives to go to the Taikoo Wharf to welcome them and distribute tea, snacks, medicines, and other comforts. It is also heard that the Association will persuade the natives of Ningbo to return to Ningbo on the same ship.</p>
<h3>Dutch Nationals in Nanjing to Evacuate</h3>
<p>⊙ The Hague. According to a statement issued by authoritative sources here, the Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai has recently requested the Italian Ambassador to China to allow Dutch nationals in Nanjing to evacuate on Italian ships. The Italian Ambassador has agreed to the request to the extent possible. (25th, National Telegraphic Service)</p>

<h3>We Are "Forced" to Hold an Exhibition Here</h3>
<p>We are "forced"—to hold an exhibition here.</p>
<p>They not only use "military warfare," land warfare, naval warfare, and air warfare, to invade us, they also aggressively invade us with "combined warfare." "Economic aggression," isn't it? "Political warfare" involving many unequal treaties, isn't it? They also want to use "ideological warfare" to suppress us. "Cultural aggression" is already enough, but they are not satisfied. On Chinese territory, they dare to use "cultural suppression" to suppress us—we Chinese!</p>
<p>Although the works of us children are not only naive but simply scribbled, and it can rightly be said that they resemble nothing at all? One spot of red here, one spot of black there, they really can't be considered paintings, let alone famous or valuable paintings. But when they only know how to take a broom-like brush, stir some colors on the tip, and scribble randomly on the paper, they only feel the enemy's planes whirling "whoosh whoosh" overhead, and the enemy's heavy artillery booming "rumble rumble" in their ears. They only feel that our loyal and brave soldiers are raising their bayonets on the front line, charging! A bayonet thrusts forward, killing! The enemies fall backward one by one, and our loyal and brave soldiers charge forward! In the trenches, by the barbed wire, on the ground, in the sky, everything is red—red blood, red artillery fire, the red hearts of our brave soldiers. We only know how to follow our minds and take up the brush, scribbling on the paper as frantically and excitedly as if we were killing the enemy on the front line. We only know that this is called "spirit"! This is called "strength"! We scribble one after another, piling up so much "spirit"! So much "strength"!</p>
<p>We don't know if they are paintings, because we are not famous artists, great painters! We hope you will forgive these frantic children.</p>
<p>We started working on this from the first day the enemy invaded our Shanghai, and it's been less than a month and a half. But we are comforted that all our work is finally completed. We offer comfort every day, visiting almost every wounded soldier hospital and every shelter. We asked cartoonists to paint three giant patriotic paintings for us (we also wanted to exhibit them, and during the "September 18th Incident," we wanted to parade them on a large truck... but...). We also learned to collaborate on a giant "Chinese Vanguard Team," ready to dedicate it to the government. Although it doesn't look like anything, we ourselves see millions of Chinese soldiers inside, countless tanks, and teams of artillery vehicles emerging from the iron Great Wall in a mighty array. In the city, four large cannons also protrude, and in the sky, there are countless planes. This is our air force, awakening the invaders from their delusions, flying out from the Great Wall in large squadrons!</p>
<p>We made it from a small piece of paper only twelve square feet in size. It's pitiful that these frantic children only eat hard Shandong pancakes and drink plain boiled water, but we have finally done this in a short month and a half, and sent the "Chinese Children" to the children of the whole country. "In the Fire of War" (written from the fire of war of "January 28th" to the current "August 13th," "Put Down Your Whip," "Dreaming of Beiping," writing about the lost capital) has also been performed and is being filmed by the Lianhua branch factory.</p>
<p>Now we are "forced," forced not to continue doing it here! But, we, the invaders will not die for a day, and our work will not rest for a day.</p>
<p>We only know that we have "spirit"! We have "strength"!</p>
<p>We are forced to go to the capital first, taking two routes, from Hankou to Sichuan... to shake hands with the compatriots in the hinterland! To Nanyang, to shake hands with our beloved overseas compatriots!</p>
<p>We are forced, forced to leave here, goodbye!</p>
<h3>The True Joy in the Paintings</h3>
<p>— Chen Juanjuan, Age Nine</p>
<p>We children don't understand hypocrisy, nor do we tell lies. Everything comes from the bottom of our hearts. When we are sad, we open our mouths and cry. When we are happy, we laugh a lot. Adults say we are innocent. This innocence must mean that we don't deliberately pretend.</p>
<p>For example, when we draw pictures, we also don't understand what restraint is. Recently, I have made many paintings, specifically taking this war of resistance as the background. The more I paint, the happier I become. The happier I am, the more I want to paint. I draw a large plane flying to the enemy headquarters, dropping a large bomb that destroys all the houses below. I also draw the Chinese Big Sword Team, killing all the heads of the enemy one by one, and another Chinese soldier brings them back. The soldiers of the Chinese Big Sword Team also stride back spiritedly, showing off: "Am I brave?" I have painted dozens of such anti-enemy paintings, and everyone says, "Good! Good!"</p>
<p>Now my large works have been sent to the Children's Patriotic Cartoon Exhibition for all the adults and gentlemen to give me your advice. Goodbye.</p>
<h3>Everyone, Come and Kill Those Who Invade Us!</h3>
<p>— Shen Jun, Age Sixteen</p>
<h3>Two Satisfying Works</h3>
<p>— Li Keng, Age Nine</p>
<p>I like to play ping-pong, and everyone knows that I like to play ping-pong. But recently I don't like to play ping-pong anymore. Why? Because I'm focused on drawing pictures, desperately drawing pictures. I want to draw three pictures a day. My most satisfying picture is called: "Dare You Come In? I'll Give You a Knife and a Gun!" This painting of a knife and a gun is very powerful and hard, full of spirit. Another satisfying picture is called "Triumph," depicting a row of Chinese soldiers with their faces covered in blood, but their faces are smiling indifferently, and their hands are reaching up high to wave to us. These two large paintings are on display in this exhibition in front of all the gentlemen.</p>
<h3>Why Can't We Draw the Rising Sun Flag?</h3>
<p>— Mou Ling, Age Seven</p>
<p>Before we opened the "First Children's Patriotic Cartoon Exhibition," we were very enthusiastic about drawing patriotic cartoons. We finally finished drawing them one by one. Some of them had the Japanese Rising Sun Flag on them, but I heard that these paintings couldn't be exhibited and that the Rising Sun Flag had to be painted over. Hmph! I'm really angry. Why can't we draw the Rising Sun Flag of the enemies who are invading us?</p>
<h3>Look at the Gun!</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiangying, Age Fifteen</p>
<h3>Cartooning for National Salvation</h3>
<p>— Yao Yuanyan, Age Fourteen</p>
<p>The brutal Japanese have been invading our country for several decades. Although we also wrote many slogans during the "January 28th Incident": "Down with Japanese Imperialism" and "Boycott Japanese Goods," etc., I haven't seen this kind of situation since the "January 28th Incident" ended.</p>
<p>The "August 13th" Shanghai War is the prelude to a full-scale Sino-Japanese war. We children wanted to write some words to publicize the brutal killing of our compatriots by the brutal Japanese and the sacrifice of our loyal soldiers for the country, but we couldn't write them. So we thought of giving speeches, but it's impossible without good drafts. We can't give speeches either, so we failed again. Finally, we figured it out. We can use drawings to express ourselves. We know that our soldiers are brave and kind, so we drew a kind and brave face. We know that Japanese soldiers are brutal and cowardly, so we drew a vicious and frightened face. We know what colors things are, so we added those colors. We want to let all the children of Shanghai, all the people of Shanghai, know our ability. We want to let all the people of China know the power of our little citizens and the brutality of the Japanese devils!</p>
<h3>Charge! Charge! The Bugle Call of the Charge! Charge!</h3>
<p>— Wang Ziqing, Age Sixteen</p>
<h3>National Salvation and Cartoons</h3>
<p>— Shen Jun, Age Fifteen</p>
<p>We have been bullied by the Japanese devils for many years, and now we have to rise up and resist. So we are here drawing many pictures to show our courage, because Japan has dared to hurt us too deeply. We know what it's like when cannons fire. What are Japanese devils like? What are Chinese troops like? Airplanes, guns, cannons, bombs, Big Sword Teams, warships, and all kinds of weapons are drawn here. We want to cheer up, go and kill the hateful Japanese devils, drive out our enemies, and recover our land. We don't want to be subjugated slaves. Everyone must stand tall and protect our land. This is the meaning of our opening cartoons for national salvation.</p>
<h3>Why Open a "National Salvation Cartoon" Exhibition?</h3>
<p>— Jiang Quqiao, Age Sixteen</p>
<p>Why are we opening a "National Salvation Cartoon" exhibition? Tell you, children: We see that the country has been made very bad by the Japanese bandits, and our brave soldiers are killing Japanese pigs and deer on the front line. Our hearts ache for the country. We really hate it. Why are we so small? Otherwise, we would also like to shoulder guns and take big swords to the front line and have a great time killing.</p>
<p>The country belongs to everyone. When the country is in danger, everyone should rise up to save it. We don't have the strength to shoulder guns. Does that mean we shouldn't save the country? We are Chinese. We are Chinese who don't want to be subjugated slaves. We are afraid that people will scold us for being subjugated slaves, useless things. We want to save the country. Everyone is willing. If we have a little strength, we will take a little strength to save it. We twenty or so children think every day, thinking about doing our best for the country.</p>
<p>On August 29th, we came up with the idea. We will create patriotic drawings for publicity, using drawings to tell children how dangerous the country is; our soldiers are very bravely killing Japanese devils on the front line; we should all rise up, rise up to save the country from this danger. When we thought of it, we drew it. We draw desperately every day. Now there are so many. Although they are not well drawn, we also feel very satisfied.</p>
<p>We are really comfortable, because we have also done a little bit of our strength for the country. And we will work harder in the future, and we will have a second and third cartoon exhibition!</p>
<h3>Rise Up! Children of All China!</h3>
<p>— Jiang Baisheng, Age Sixteen</p>
<h3>Children's Cartoon Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiangying, Age Fifteen</p>
<p>The full-scale war of resistance has already begun, and the blood of all Chinese compatriots is boiling along with it. Those with strength contribute strength, those with money contribute money. The soldiers in the front are fighting bravely against the enemy. They are shedding their hot blood on the battlefield to defend China, this country with a four-thousand-year history and four hundred and fifty million descendants of the Yellow Emperor. But we are all very naive and ignorant children. In terms of our abilities, we certainly cannot go to the battlefield to kill the enemy, but we are also the people of China. We should all take on a great mission to contribute to our motherland.</p>
<p>So, during this summer vacation, we gathered many children and organized a Children's National Salvation Association. Our knowledge is certainly very shallow. Several times we wanted to do some work, such as fundraising, but because of the darkness of the real society and the many traitors, our work could not continue. Under the leadership of Mr. Huang, we finally decided to open a children's cartoon exhibition in the shortest possible time. All the children are working excitedly. Although our achievements are not very good and there is no direct benefit to the country, when every citizen looks at that red blood and artillery fire, I think everyone will be moved. Soon we will contribute it to the compatriots of every Republic of China. I hope you will give us correct criticism and guidance.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Efforts from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Children's Sector</p>
<p>The Children's National Salvation Association held a reception yesterday at 3 p.m. for representatives of various sectors, including authorities, charitable organizations, national salvation associations, news agencies, and newspapers, totaling more than 50 people. First, the person in charge of the association reported on the recent developments and work plans of the association. The work is divided into five departments: comfort, national salvation propaganda, film, publication, and drama. The drama department has already rehearsed three national salvation plays, "Put Down Your Whip," "In the Midst of Fire," and "Dreaming of Beiping," starring Li Keng, Chen Juanjuan, Mou Ling, and others. They will first perform at various refugee camps and wounded soldier hospitals, and then go to various places with the national salvation propaganda department to promote national salvation. The film department will film the three children's national salvation plays that have been arranged and carry them to various towns and villages for mobile screenings. Representatives from the children's sector, Li Keng, Chen Juanjuan, and Mou Ling, then gave speeches. The meeting adjourned after more than an hour.</p>
<p>Cartoon Sector</p>
<p>Since the birth of the inaugural issue of "National Salvation Cartoons," it has been praised by the general public and purchased in large quantities by enthusiastic readers for posting in various neighborhoods or refugee camps. Therefore, the inaugural issue of the newspaper was once reprinted. It is reported that the first issue is scheduled to be published today (the 26th). The content is richer. The cover is "Japanese Carrying Corpses Back Home" by Jiang Mi; the continuous cartoons "We Have No Home" by Cai Ruohong; "The Great Change in Shanghai" by Chen Chuza; "The Flame of Justice Spreads Across the East Asian Continent" by Shen Zhengeng; "Unexpected Sympathy from the International Community for the Japanese" by Xuan Xiangquan; and "Five-Day Guide Cartoon" by Lu Shaofei. All are carefully crafted works that can attack the enemy with satirical techniques or encourage the patriotic sentiment of compatriots with encouraging pictures. It is expected that this issue of "National Salvation Cartoons" will be even more welcomed by readers.</p>
<h3>The State of the Japanese Navy</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>In 1921, the Washington Naval Conference of Five Nations was held, and the result was. It stipulated the ratio of naval power for the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan in terms of capital ships. The ratio was 5:5:3. That is, the United Kingdom and the United States each possessed a total tonnage of 525,000 tons of capital ships. Japan had 315,000 tons. Later, Japan violated the treaty. Secretly built ships. Therefore, after the London Conference. Japan again proposed equality. As a result, the meeting broke down due to opposition from various countries. Since then. Japan has entered an era without treaties. Vigorously expanding its military, how many capital ships and auxiliary ships does it actually have now? That is not easy to understand. Based on a survey five years ago, there were a total of 383 ships, totaling 1,155,600 tons. The major battleships included:</p>
<p>A. Capital ships (battleships): Mutsu (33,800 tons) equipped with eight 16-inch guns; Nagato (33,800 tons) (same as above); Hyuga (31,260 tons) equipped with eleven 14-inch guns; Ise (same as above) (same as above); Yamashiro (30,600 tons) (same as above); Fuso (same as above) (same as above); (battlecruisers) Kirishima (27,500 tons) (equipped with eight 14-inch guns); Haruna (30,500 tons) (same as above); Hiei (27,500 tons) (same as above); Kongo (same as above).</p>
<p>This is the main force of the Japanese Navy, the so-called Six-Four Fleet, which is composed of six battleships and four cruisers.</p>
<p>B. (Auxiliary ships) Twelve first-class cruisers, twenty-one second-class cruisers, four aircraft carriers, seventy first-class destroyers, thirty-five second-class destroyers, four submarine tenders, twenty-eight first-class submarines, thirty-six second-class submarines, two torpedo boats, five mine-laying ships, eight coastal defense ships, thirteen gunboats, twelve minesweepers, twenty-four special service ships (those kept secret are not included) (Aircraft carriers) Akagi (26,900 tons) (equipped with ten 20 cm guns and twelve 11 cm guns); Kaga (26,900 tons) (equipped with ten 20 cm guns and eleven 12 cm guns); Ryujo (details unknown); Hosho (7,400 tons), (Cruisers) Myoko (10,000 tons) (equipped with ten 8-inch guns); Nachi (10,000 tons) (equipped with ten 8-inch guns); Ashigara (10,000 tons) (equipped with ten 8-inch guns); Haguro (10,000 tons) (equipped with ten 8-inch guns); Takao (10,000 tons) (equipped with ten 8-inch guns); Atago (10,000 tons) (equipped with ten 8-inch guns); Chokai (10,000 tons) (equipped with ten 8-inch guns); Maya (10,000 tons) (equipped with ten 8-inch guns); Kako (7,500 tons) (equipped with six 8-inch guns); Furutaka (7,500 tons) (equipped with six 8-inch guns); Kinugasa (7,500 tons) (equipped with six 8-inch guns); Aoba (7,500 tons) (equipped with six 8-inch guns) (Light cruisers) Tenryu (3,500 tons) (equipped with four 5.5-inch guns); Tatsuta (3,500 tons) (equipped with four 5.5-inch guns); Kuma (5,500 tons) (equipped with seven 5.5-inch guns); Tama (5,500 tons) (equipped with seven 5.5-inch guns); Kitakami (5,500 tons) (equipped with seven 5.5-inch guns); Oi (5,500 tons) (equipped with seven 5.5-inch guns); Kiso (5,500 tons) (equipped with seven 5.5-inch guns); Nagara (5,570 tons) (armament same as above); Isuzu (5,570 tons) (armament same as above); Natori (5,570 tons) (armament same as above); Yura (5,570 tons) (armament same as above); Kinu (5,570 tons) (armament same as above); Abukuma (5,570 tons) (armament same as above); Naka (5,570 tons) (armament same as above); Sendai (5,570 tons) (armament same as above); Jintsu (5,570 tons) (armament same as above); Yubari (3,100 tons) (equipped with six 5.5-inch guns) (Submarines) I-Go (from No. 1 to No. 5, 1,970 tons) (equipped with six torpedo tubes); I-Go (from No. 21 to No. 24, 1,150 tons) (equipped with four torpedo tubes); I-Go (No. 51 and No. 52, 1,400 tons) (equipped with eight torpedo tubes); I-Go (from No. 53 to No. 59, 1,600 tons) (equipped with eight torpedo tubes); I-Go (No. 60 and No. 61, 1,600 tons) (equipped with six torpedo tubes); I-Go (No. 62 and No. 63, 1,600 tons, 8 hatches), I-Go (No. 64 and No. 67, 1,600 tons, 6 hatches), Ro-Go (from No. 1 to No. 2, 689 tons, same as 5 hatches), Ro-Go (from No. 3 to No. 5, same as above), Ro-Go (No. 11 and No. 12, 270 tons) (same as 6 hatches), Ro-Go (from No. 3 to No. 25, 740 tons) (same as 6 hatches), Ro-Go (from No. 36 to No. 28, 750 tons) (same as 4 hatches), Ro-Go (from No. 29 to No. 32, 665 tons) (same as 4 hatches), Ro-Go (from No. 51 to No. 59, 900 tons) (same as 6 hatches), Ro-Go (from No. 60 to No. 68, 998 tons) (same as 6 hatches), Ha-Go (No. 1 and No. 2, 286 tons) (same as 32 hatches), Ha-Go (from No. to No. 5, 291 tons) (same as above), Ha-Go (No. 6, 604 tons (Ha-Go) same as above, No. 7 and No. 8, 290 tons) (same as 4 hatches), (Ha-Go (No. 9, 480 tons) (same as above).</p>
<p>The above is based only on the ships that were completed five years ago. There are no accurate figures available for those that have been built successively in the past five years, as the Navy Ministry strictly maintains secrecy. Approximately since the entry into the era without treaties, Japan has been vigorously building a large number of warships to compete with the United States. Among them, submarines have exceeded the United States, becoming a ratio of 8.5 to 10 for the United States and ranking first among the five countries. The number of Japanese ships compared to Washington and England is 5.00, to the United States 3.46, to France 1.15, to Italy 1.15, while Japan has as many as 8.84 ships. Japan is expanding its navy in this way to widely promote the southward advance policy. In other words, it is to develop its power in the South Seas.</p>
