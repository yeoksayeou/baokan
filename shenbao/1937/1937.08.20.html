<h3>我軍佔領匯山碼頭敵軍全綫被我切斷</h3>
<p>血戰三小時敵潰退江邊　甕中之龞即可完全解决　瀏河昨晚激戰敵軍敗走</p>
<p>中央社云、官方十九日夜間一時、正式公布、本日下午七時、我軍某師之一部、在楊樹浦方面突擊、敵陸續增援、並用飛機不斷轟炸、我軍奮不顯身、肉搏衛鋒、經三小時之血戰將敵擊退、敵狠狽不堪、向黃浦江邊一帶逃竄、我軍已佔領昆明路、岳州路、塘山路等處、並向百老匯路繼續挺進、另一部亦將匯山碼頭佔領、此役敵死傷數百人、我軍傷亡僅十餘人、奪獲軍用品甚多、現此部敵人被迫至黃浦江邊、已成甕中之龞、卽可全部解决、（記者按自滬戰爆發以來、我軍神勇奮發、迭予敵軍重創、並屢佔敵軍衝要陣地、至十七日佔領敵海軍操塲後、敵軍完全退入租界、陣地愈迫愈小、被我形成大包圍之形勢、且其東西兩路戰綫、成曲尺形、隨時有被截斷之虞、至昨日克復匯山碼頭後、敵軍遂完全被我切斷、失去聯絡、是為作戰以來最大之勝利、殘敵解决之期、當不遠矣、）</p>
<p>（本報特訊）確實消息、昨日午後、我軍在昆明路塘山路口及附近一帶、構築防禦工程、足見中路方面進展甚速、</p>
<p>中央社云、軍息、我軍十七日佔領敵海軍操塲後、前綫曾一度分向東有恒路東漢璧禮路等處推進、惟以我軍連日作戰、不免疲乏、故稍予休息、未再深進、昨日下午、頒發攻擊令、我軍於七時乘殘敵不備之際、出奇制勝、在機關槍掩護下、以手溜彈向敵陣突進、殘敵慌張異常、雖陸續增援、終不敵我軍精銳、望風披靡、我軍一鼓而下、越岳州路·塘山路·昆明路·等處、十時進佔匯山碼頭、敵軍鬥志全失、狠狽不堪、</p>
<h3>敵偷渡瀏河敗退</h3>
<p>激戰三小時敵傷亡過半　我佈置極週密萬無一失</p>
<p>（本報特訊）頃據瀏河方面確息、昨夜有日·艦十餘艘、載運日軍千餘名、分登汽船多雙、在重砲掩護之下、企圖登陸、我軍早有充分準備、待敵將近岸、立卽開砲射擊、並施放機槍掃射、雙方砲轟約三小時、敵傷亡大半、不支而退、是役我軍攻守得力、損傷極輕、微聞今明日尚有大批日軍將開往瀏河·楊林口等處偷渡、預料大戰卽將開始、</p>
<p>自滬戰發生以來、敵軍屢次慘收、創傷甚巨、士氣大餒、現擬由其本國運輸三師團來滬、惟鑒於滬上殘敵戰綫狹小、各碼頭均已破壞無餘、故擬以飛機掩護、由瀏河登岸、作孤注一擲、以謀最後掙扎、但我軍鑒於一二八戰役失敗經驗、已在瀏河備置雄厚兵力、建築堅固工事、如敵來襲、必遭痛擊、聞白龍港附近、停有敵艦十二艘空商輪四艘、數日未動、似爲殘敵退却準備、</p>
<h3>最前綫陣地視察</h3>
<p>閘北方面在固守對峙中　中東兩路我進展極迅速</p>
<p>（本報特訊）、本報記者為欲明瞭閘北江灣方面我軍陣地之形勢超見、特於昨晨赴最前綫考察、經後方軍事長官之介紹復承前後戰士之嚮導、始於上午十時許到達、得晤在前綫指揮作戰某高級長官、詳談前方形勢及連日戰况、並以案前軍用地图、指出敵軍與我軍之陣綫、據稱閘北方面、沿淞滬綫迤北至八字橋為止、我軍陣地、非常堅固、但不願進展過速、蓋以該段地形、不宜速進、尤以南面一帶、隣近租界、未便過於逼近、八字橋以北直至江灣路一帶、我軍極佔優勢、敵軍雖屢次來攻、均被我擊退、嚴近數日、敵軍始終未放前來嘗試、故昨今兩日、雙方均在固守對峙中、此次敵軍經我方幾次痛擊後、因損失甚鉅、故膽怯異常、誠恐我軍進攻、日間按兵不動、入晚卽以少數部隊、在大砲掩護之下、時來擾鬧、但一經我方應戰、彼卽後退、惟昨晚（十八日）之進犯、非常猛烈、在八時後、敵軍約集合一千餘人、先以大砲集中火力、向我方猛轟、約半小時隨卽出動戰車十餘輛、向我北路陣地衝鋒進攻、經我軍奮勇應戰、予以痛擊、激戰數小時、敵始狼狽潰退、傷亡過半、故在敵軍司令部以北沿江灣路一帶、屍身遍地、又我軍前綫、離敵方司令部不過數百米突、故此項屍身、迄今未敢近前搬運、記者又詢以東路方面、我軍進展形勢、據稱、自楊樹浦軍工路以迄日本海軍操塲向西至虹口公園方面為止、均經我軍先後收復、敵人已完全退入東區租界內、華界並無敵踪、惟詳細情况、不甚明白、最後記者復要求派員陪同前進至□□橋□□部視察、渠稱、前綫與敵軍距離極近、不但步槍能射到、卽木壳槍亦能生効、請勿前往、以免危險、記者始興辭而回、</p>
<h3>出雲艦更向東移</h3>
<p>駛楊樹浦相近江面拋泊　敵用小型砲艦每夜掩護</p>
<p>日本駐滬第三艦隊旗艦出雲號、自十七日夜經我特種物爆炸後、其艦尾之發動棄子、已告毀壞、而艦尾之右舷、亦炸裂一洞、該艦在十八日晨、卽潛移到第二第三號河筒拋泊、急加修理、在四倜施用兩重電網防御外、更派小軍艦小火輪多艘、藝艦身包圍、以防我軍襲擊、十八日午夜、我砲隊、在拒敵偷渡登陸以後、</p>
<p>又復砲轟該艦、雙方互轟甚烈、迨至十九日晨、該出雲艦、更不敢停留在二三號河筒、遂又悄然向東移開、漸次往楊樹浦方面拋停、另派名號已經塗抹之輕巡洋艦一艘、在公和祥碼頭前停泊、意在遙護該出雲艦也、又據確悉、有原泊浦東上三井碼頭一帶之日小型砲艦二艘、於每晚八時後、輒駛泊於外灘公園邊水上飯店旁、作掩護停泊該處附近出雲旗艦二十一號驅逐艦等之用、待天明後、方開回原處、每晚如此、並不間斷、</p>
<p>敵忽禁止夜航</p>
<p>日本駐滬海軍當局、昨突通知關係方面、請自昨晚七時起、至今晨五時止、在浦江一號浮筒至十號浮筒間、卽自外白渡橋起、至楊樹浦大阪碼頭止、該段浦面、不准任何船雙通行、如有外國船舶欲通過該處者、亦得事先通知日駐滬海軍當局允准後、方可行駛云云、其用意安在、殊難揣測、（中央社）</p>
<p>浦江敵艦總數</p>
<p>前日停泊浦江中之日艦、共為二十六艘、詳細情形、業誌昨報、茲據記者調查所得、昨日已有日艦十二艘駛出口外、現泊浦江內者、共為十四艘、又據確悉、現泊吳淞口外之敵艦、計驅逐艦二十五艘、大巡洋艦五艘、航空母艦二艘、每艘航空母艦上各載有飛機八十架左右、其中一艘特別龐大、其隔板為三層、飛機𣅜可自由開駛云、</p>
<p>敵搜查我關艦</p>
<p>海關福星巡艦、自敵軍起衅後、移泊於法租界新開河外浦面、以避危險、詎敵軍疑該艦上另有埋伏、故於昨日上午十時派汽油船一雙、滿載日兵數十名、並由一小型砲艦在後掩護、前往非法登艦要求搜查、經艦長堅拒無效、搜索歷一刻鐘、並無所獲、羞漸而去、</p>
<p>敵艦書去夜來</p>
<p>又停在外洋涇江面、及領事署前之敵驅逐艦兩艘、連日經我空軍轟炸、昨日已𥁞向楊樹浦方面逃去、不敢再在原處留停、惟至夜間九時以後、各該日艦仍偷駛至日領事署前停泊、待黎明時後向東開去、</p>
<h3>外報紀我軍勝利</h3>
<p>我新陣綫業經善加組織　日屢次反攻已證明失敗</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、就昨晨（十八日）華軍攻擊之情形觀之、顯已獲有厚援、因日軍雖終日發砲轟擊、並以飛機襲擊、終不能擊退之、此足證華軍之新陣綫、業經善加組織、華軍攻擊甚有秩序、觀戰者聲稱、其前進乃由具有軍事學識者計畫、徒惜輔助之砲隊與高射砲力量尚欠充足、否則進步尚可更形順利也、華軍佔據之各工廠、除為軍事原因外、絕不加以損害、據巡視華軍佔據地段之某觀戰者昨日聲稱、華兵嚴守紀律、絕無搶刦行為、華軍到滬後、因未卽開戰、頗為失望、今則士氣甚壯、𣅜靜待敵軍之反攻、此可以一事證明者、昨日下午日飛機雖彈如雨下、轟炸華軍新陣地、然華軍並未退讓寸土、華軍因報復昨晨日軍空龔起見、曾在江灣發砲猛轟虹口區、彈多中的、致有數處起火、延燒多時、日兵營附近亦中數彈而起火、但是否為日軍司令部、未能查明、日清公司浦東碼頭所泊日船六艘、昨為華軍佔據、在南市封江處觸沉、日小驅逐艦兩艘雖馳往援救、但毫不能為力、據日海軍當局聲稱、此數船共值一千萬元、</p>
<p>字林報云、星期二日華軍曾在韜朋路附近擊破日軍陣綫、而進至華德路、雙方繼乃鏖戰、黎明時華軍新陣地之亮光、為江中日巡洋艦察覺、乃向發砲猛轟、日軍亦從事反攻、日軍雖稱已奪回失地、但據情勢察之、從能稍進、决不致全行奪回也、日軍又稱、已奪回星期二日所失楊樹浦區失地、但就昨夜驚醒租界內居民之砲聲觀之、此說殊為可疑、蓋昨夜之砲、乃由兩面發出、華軍旣被逐出楊樹浦區、則華軍何以能由楊榭浦方面猛攻、而使日軍艦向之猛轟乎、華軍於前夜深入楊樹浦區後、現已進至英美烟草公司貨棧附近、當經過該棧時、棧內中國工人予以歡迎、紛由牆上以紙烟贈之、</p>
<h3>浦東情形尚安謐</h3>
<p>日華紗廠已焚燬一部份　敵圖在洋涇區登岸失敗</p>
<p>浦江敵艦與我浦東駐軍、昨晚仍有斷續之砲戰、惟不若前兩晚之劇烈、砲聲時作時息、晚間九時後、每隔一小時、必有數砲、中間雜有密集之機槍聲、則為掃除上岸之殘餘敵軍及便衣隊也、</p>
<p>中央社云、敵軍在虹口受挫、陣地日蹙、正擬向浦東方面進襲、以冀佔據陣地、遙策其殘軍之反攻、故日來我敵兩軍、每於傍晚起、卽發生隔江激戰、記者為明瞭該處情形起見、特渡浦訪詢、在渡埠見逃難人民、携帶箱籠、均行色匆促、憂形於色、蓋日機多架、正盤旋上空、頻以機槍掃射也、浦東爛泥渡街一带、向稱繁盛、今已十室九空、惟因保衛團嚴密衛戍、故秩序甚佳、大街各商店昨晨已開市、惟交易淸淡、有於機聲軋中、團坐作方城戲者、可謂鎭靜已極、路經日華紗廠、共前廠房有一部曾被火、尚在冒烟、至其倉房则均封閉、絕未駐有敵軍、且聞該廠主人有兩子均被徵往華北戰死、最後徵及其本人、乃閉廠投浦自殺、旋訪晤駐防之隊部長官、詳談該方之情形、據謂滬戰爆發、敵主力雖向閘北方面進攻、但我對浦東之防衛、未稍懈怠、敵方果於西攻失利、而圖東進、十六十八兩夜、敵艦進襲、經沉着应戰、將其擊退、我並用巨砲轟擊、均能命中、敵計不售、則頻以飛機偵察、或施轟炸、或用機槍掃射、我方並無損失云、繼謂記者浦東後方之組織尚欠完備、且無良好醫院、傷兵救護困難、尚望上海人士、熱心接濟、前方將士並需要兩具藥包及餅乾等、亦希各方捐助云、</p>
<p>浦東洋涇區方面之敵、迭次企圖在新三井老三井碼頭及日華紗廠等處登岸、但終為我軍所擊退、前晚日華紗廠中彈起火、焚燬一部份、三井碼頭亦已破毀、故敵已無法登岸、但我軍仍戒備極嚴、現在洋涇區一帶極為平安、後方𥝭序之維持、得力於該區保衛團者居多云、</p>
<h3>首批敵援軍抵滬</h3>
<p>援軍總數共爲三個師團　在何處登陸殊值得注意</p>
<p>滬戰發生以來、已歷一週、我軍節節勝利、全線猛速進展、敵氣已陷入大包圍中、因此急調援軍來滬、據報敵軍一師團、已於昨日赶到、昨午由二十五艘運輸艦驅逐艦、運抵上海、到達吳淞口外、擬卽設法登陸、聞尚有一師團、亦在繼續開拔中、滬東各碼頭、大半俱被我砲火燬損、虹口區域甚少、亦難容納如此大量敵軍、故其在何處登岸殊為值得注意之事、</p>
<p>字林報云、昨夜（十八日）據可靠方面消息、日兵三師團、共約六萬人、將於後數日內開抵上海、第一批今晨可創、第二批一兩日內可到、第三批到期未悉、</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、聞吳淞口外今晨（十九日）開到日運船十艘、日內將有日常備軍兩師團、約五萬人、有一部曾參加一二八戰事者、登陸助戰、一二八之役、日本用兵五萬人、始擊退十九路軍、今次華軍兵力、厚於十九路軍、一二八之役、日軍在瀏河潛行登陸、始克奏功、昨據華軍陣線後外國觀戰員聲稱、日軍團在瀏河登陸、已遭失敗、該處華軍築防甚固云、</p>
<p>中央社云、昨日上午我軍繼續進攻、至午十二時許、我軍中路己挺進至其美路底、及岳州路、塘山路一帶、敵軍不支、已全部退入租界、滬東區南部現我軍砲火正集中匯山碼頭一帶、冀於最短期內、將敵軍右右兩翼陣地、完全切斷、</p>
<p>敵衝吳淞受創而退</p>
<p>吳淞方面敵軍、於昨晨八時四十分許、在大砲掩護下、希圖衝我陣地、幸我防護工事、早已建築堅固、當經我砲隊迎頭痛擊、卒使敵受重創而退、一時砲聲隆隆、租界清晰可聞、事後有數處房屋、中彈起火、延燒達數小時、另據前夜駛滬之某外輪息、該輪駛經吳淞時、見有砲轟遺跡、閘北水電公司房屋、亦彈孔纍纍、惟滬江大學、仍巍然存在、怡和公司建築、似亦無損云、</p>
<p>虬江碼頭斃敵數百</p>
<p>（本報特訊）滬戰以來、敵軍迭遭慘敗、陣地愈縮愈小、勢將陷於絕境、曾數度擬向浦東登陸、擴展其作戰之根據地、但均被我軍擊退、據官方消息、前夜（十八日）敵軍三百餘人又擬向虬江碼頭登陸、我方得報、佯作不知、鎮靜以待、及敵軍靠近碼頭時、出其不意、奮勇突擊、敵軍因未提防、一時倉皇失措、全部被我解决、我方僅傷亡十餘人、</p>
<p>敵犯北站業已擊退</p>
<p>十八日夜敵以巨量砲火向我北站陣地劇烈轟擊、步兵亦衝鋒進攻、我軍冒彈浴血、奮勇還擊、卒將敵軍擊退、北站以南之敵、未敢再犯、</p>
<p>敵軍一路、十八日下午七時由白沙涇港向我猛烈反攻、我軍奮勇迎頭痛擊、結果該路之敵、不支而退、此役斃敵二十餘人、奪獲輕機關槍一挺、小軍旗二十餘面、</p>
<p>日本啤酒廠附近之敵軍陣地、十八日下午七時、被我砲擊命中着火、火熖熊態、歷一小時許始熄、我軍士氣極盛、正待機向該處進攻中、</p>
<p>中央社云虹口方面之敵約二千餘名、十八日下午五時向我已佔據之日海軍俱樂部反攻、經我軍迎擊、激戰一小時、敵在飛機掩護之下、曾數次衢鋒、均被我軍擊退、結果敵死傷八百餘人、我傷亡甚輕、此後我並截獲敵槍彈甚夥、</p>
<h3>各國艦輪須十二小時內遠離日艦五海里</h3>
<p>否則我國攻擊日艦之時　所受任何損害概不負責　敵以美艦為掩蔽殊可恥　外部昨午後三時通知各國使領</p>

<p>中央社南京十九日電、自滬上日軍啟寡、向我保安隊進攻、我方迫不得已、實行抵抗以來、日方軍艦、往往故意停泊歐美軍艦或商輪之旁、使我方顧慮第三者生命財產之安全、不便自由攻擊、而彼反利用其優越地位、以大砲向我陣地轟擊、此種情勢、我前方之軍隊、深為憤慨不平、認爲日方託庇外人勢力、至為怯懦可鄙、而歐美軍艦與商輪、不使日方軍艦遠離、無形中不啻予日艦以保護、陷我方軍事於不利地位、亦非公平之道、聞我軍事常局、十九日已通知英美法義等國駐華使節、請其轉飭各該國在滬之軍艦興商輪、至少須開駛距離日方軍艦五海里之外、或令日方軍艦開駛至距各該國軍艦或商輪之同樣距離、如上項請求在十二小時內未能照辦、則中國空軍、或其他武裝力量、與日本軍艦發生衝突時、如損及各該國軍艦或商輪、中國概不負任何責任云、</p>

<p>盡力保護租界生命財產　美國派軍來滬引起注意</p>
<p>［倫敦］美聯社今日自權威方面得悉、英國政府對於上海之英國商業及經濟利益、在任何環境之下、决不放棄、每日郵報載稱、內閣已考慮添派軍隊赴滬云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］連日外間妄傳、上海英僑擬全體退出、致引起無謂之恐慌、茲由負責方面予以切實否認、謂英政府不特任令上海英僑自顧其利益且將予以堅决之保護、僅英僑之願離滬者、或應離滬者、始移往香港、星期二內閣開會後發表之文告、即可證明一切、即英政府將取各種可能計劃保衛英僑生命與利益是也、（中央社十九日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］茲據倫敦晨郵報華盛頓記者之報告、美國與列强在遠東之合作、遇有若干政治上之困難、現派遣海軍赴滬之全部影響、尚未明瞭、但倘該事不受强烈反對而通過、則行政當局之地位、益覺鞏固、而可進行其在遠東之嚴厲政策、除决定增加軍隊之外、幵已决定在日本高壓之下、不再放棄一元錢利益、或－分之尊嚴、倘日後日軍佔領上海、國際軍隊不能維持上海之治安、則日本對於地方法律治安之橫加干涉、勢將無以咎之、總之、美國今後决不放棄遠東之勢力及利益、羅斯福總統所關心者、尤不願外間對於美國視爲日就衰微之國家云、（中央社十九日路透電）</p>

<h3>上海安全問題英提出調停案</h3>
<p>要求中日兩軍撤退　法已贊同美尚冷淡</p>
<p>［倫敦］英政府迄今尚覺中日間日臻嚴重之戰爭、尚非無調解之餘地、而上海緊張之局面、尤應立卽加以解除、庶公共租界之安全、得由兩國之同意、將軍隊重新佈置、而獲保障、關於中止上海危局一事、英外交當局於最近若干日中、已屢向上海當地各國使領及海陸軍當局、以及中日兩國政府磋商、結果已由外交途徑、向中日政府提山具體建議、建議之內容未詳、但公共租界之與中日戰區之隔離計劃、應有如下之諸要點、㊀互相同意中日雙方海陸軍共同退出上海四週之地帶、㊁向日本擔保其僑民之安全、並向中國擔保日方不利用公共租界爲根據地、而保護日僑之責、則由租界內各國軍隊共同擔任之云、現上海英當局巳設非將非必需冒此危險之僑民、大多爲婦孺、先行撤退、美當局亦如此、但多數英僑以事業所在、未能放棄、故已决定採取有效方法、實行保僑及僑民之利益、（中央社十八日路透電）</p>

<p>［華盛頓］此間人士對於英國所提上海四週設中立區之議、頗形冷淡、蓋覺外國此際提出任何建議、均不能有影響及於中國或日本也、惟赫兩本人對此計劃、未發評論、（中央社十九日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英國政府業向意大利政府提出通知、頃悉意國駐英代辦曾於本日午後訪晤英國外務當局、詢以上項建議、中日兩國若果予以接受、則意國可否與英法美三國會同保護日本利益、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］泰晤士報載稱、關於英法美三國採取聯合行動一節、吾人未可太抱樂觀、現時所能做到者、僅三國駐滬領事隨時保持密切接觸、使步驟更爲有效、但將來討論新計劃時、日本必將要求保護旅滬日僑之生命財產、殆無疑義因此聯合行動之計劃、前途未許樂觀云、（十九日國民海通電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］據外交界人士聲稱、英國政府現正在東京南京方面賡槚進行交涉、謀使中日兩國各將本國軍隊自上海撤退、而由英法美三國負責保護日本在公共租界所保有之利益、一俟中日兩國接受此項計劃之後、即當向法美兩國接洽、請其會同英國負責保護日本利益、惟英國消息靈通人士則以爲、依照中日兩國方面最後消息、上項建議極少實現希望、英國政府現僅作最後的企圖、以盡人事、即美國願否參加其事、亦尚不可知云、（中央社十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］英法各報今日以動人之形式、刊登英法兩國駐德大使與中國駐德大使館情報員在德外部談話之消息認為有重要討論、頃據德國權威人士宣稱、英大使漢德森及法大使彭賽赴德外部送達照會、僅覺友誼詢問性質、而中國大使館情報員亦僅與德外部職員舉行非正式談話云（十九日國民海通電）</p>
<h3>美對中日戰爭不施行中立法</h3>
<p>商務部長發表談話　中日兩國處境不同</p>
<p>［華盛頓］關於中日戰事、美商務部長羅伯今日發生談話稱、因中日兩國所處地位之不同、美國宣佈施行中立法、有援助某國之嫌、此則吾人所不願爲者也、並調本年五個月中、美國輸往中國貨物共值二六·二五六·○○○元、而赴日本者則爲一四○·三二五·○○○元、運日貨品以棉．油·及煤油爲大宗、倘中立法施行、此等貨品是否將認作軍用品、實爲重要問題、再則、中國最近添購火車頭六具、似不致受戰事影響而停運云、（中央社十八日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］商務部長羅伯頃就遠東時局向各報發表談話、略稱、任何措施、對於中日兩國凡有偏袒一方之嫌者、美國政府均不擬予以採取、總之、美國政府對於各該國均願與之維持友好關係、嚴守中立地位、而不願採取任何措置、以招致中國或日本之惡感云、（中央社十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］商務部長羅伯今日表示、美國倘實施中立法、即將危及美國對於中日兩國之商務、共黨眾議院贊許今日在眾院贊成撥款美金五十萬元爲救濟戰區美僑之用、惟反對增派軍隊、費氏謂美僑在華不足萬人、何必添派陸戰隊一千二．百名至滬、實際上美國應撤退美華海軍、以免牽入亞洲之戰局云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>赫爾說明撤僑辦法</h3>
<p>英兵又一營開滬</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國務鄉爾頃發表談話、說明美國政府現方竭力設法撤退上海美國僑民、並謂美官廳不僅勸告美國婦孺退出上海、卽男子之不必留駐上海以保護私人利益者、亦均勸其退出、此外、美國駐香港領事、鑒於上海英國僑民、紛紛避至香港、加之該處現有流行性症、故已通告遠東各處美國領事、轉勸美僑勿往香港、（中央社十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國卿赫爾今日發稱美國駐華外交官員現警告上海及其他危險地點之美僑、無居留之必要者、全行退出、前者撤退勸告、僅以婦孺爲限、現並及於旅行者、教員與教士、國務院以爲僅上海自來水與電力公司之美國工程師及外交官員、有居留之充分重要理由、赫爾預料、至週杪美僑撤退者共有一千七百人、留居者約二千人、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］上海戰事發生之後英國勃特拉夫地方毛織品、對上海出口事業、幾即全部停頓、某廠業已完全停止出口、其他各廠與上海進口商所訂合同、則或僅暫停履行、或竟被撤銷、貨物運往上海之保險費、現巳猛漲、此在各業出口商人、亦均認爲過高、又有若干實業家、對於運往上海現在途中之貨物頗感不安、或將改在香港卸運以待上海戰事之結束、亦未可知云、（中央社十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德國注意</h3>
<p>［柏林］德國一般人民、對上海戰事、極爲關懷、柏林及各省報紙均以第一頁登載上海消息對於上海公共租界內炸死之德國水兵戈克以及炸傷之其他德僑、深表同情、各報除刊登上海戰事消息外、並登載旅滬德僑之專文、俾讀者對於滬戰情形更能熟悉、與遠東有文化及商務關係之各團體、則隨時以電話詢問在滬親戚朋友之安全間題云、（十九日國民海通電）</p>
<p>［柏林］德國各報、對中日事件極爲關心、上海南京東京各地所來之長篇消息、充滿報端、一般論調認爲此項衝突、不利於遠東及整個世界之經濟發展、深可惋惜、並指陳九國公約之其他七個簽字國現時只能靜觀事變、必須日本行動、妨害簽字國中之利益、則彼等必將出而干涉、遠東事件之國際性、俟日本之目的表明後、即可昭然若揭、至日本之目的、據該報推測、乃欲在華北產生‘綏衝國’云、（十八日國民海通電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本第一次吞炸彈</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>九一八之役。卽有人謂日本之侵略東省。等於吞下一炸彈。其言至堪玩味。但其時這個炸彈。幸未爆發。得以安然吞下。日人遂以為中國的炸彈。是無爆發性的於是第二次再想吞一炸彈。不料第二次的炸彈竟然爆發起來其爆發力的程度。究竟若何尚未可以預料。但現在日本方面所受的創傷。畢竟非同小可。</p>
<p>一·日本根據租界為用兵根據地。這種行為非但是不應該。而且亦是極危險的。日棲根據閘北江灣一帶為作戰的根據地。但被我大軍重重包圍之下非但毫無發展。并且陣地漸漸縮小。在此種情形之下。不得不另謀出路。於是浦東瀏河等處。力謀登陸以圖戰局的展開。但事實上我方各地早已準備。無從展布其企圖。兵法所謂絕地母留。正是此種境地。</p>
<p>一·日本自準備作戰以來。其每月軍費據外國軍事家計算。每日約須千七百餘萬元。故日本政府已三次增加軍費預算。此種情形非但富力缺乏的國家。無法支持。卽富力雄厚的國家。亦恐難以為繼。此次戰事。日本在經濟上的損失。已難作數字計算。故日本則利在速戰。我方則利在久戰。只要能支持三月或半年。日方內部必能發生變化。此不但我國所能預料。亦為世人所共知的事實。</p>
<p>一·日本利用租界。為負嵎之計。此非但各國的商業。無法經營。而公共的治安亦幾無從保障。卽如昨日日軍竟包圍滬東區匯山路捕房及榆林路捕房人員。不准撤退。又日飛機在江陰等處。施放毒瓦斯炸彈。此種行為多是違背人道。違背公法的慘酷行為。倘各國亦無法制止。其慘毒的結果。眞是不堪預言。</p>
<p>日本素自稱為文明國的國家。而其舉動的謬妄。竟一至於此。非但為我國人夢想不到。恐亦各國人士所夢想不到者也。日本在南口商都方面。旣遭重大挫折。而在上海。又等於山窮水盡。此種悲慘的結果。誰實使之。誰實為之。現在最後的勝利。雖尚未敢自誇。但此種爆發之炸彈。實非日人始料所及此矣。</p>

<h3>葡捷絕交</h3>
<p>起因於購買軍火</p>
<p>⊙葡京　葡萄牙政府今日發表官報稱、捷克駐葡公使費義勒立郎離開葡境、足證日來盛傳葡捷斷絕外交關係之消息、確然屬實據葡政府宣稱、葡國為推進軍備計劃、與捷克國立軍火廠、訂購大批關槍、捷克政府忽突然宣佈、不能將軍火輸出、此舉顯受第三者之指使、葡國雖願盡力與捷克敦睦邦交、但此種矛盾被動之政策、葡國為國家榮譽計、實難以容忍、故不得已而出此云、（十九日國民海通電）</p>
<p>⊙捷克京城　葡萄牙國政府自與捷克斷絕外交關係之後、捷克政府頃訓令駐葡公使仍留駐任所、直至葡國政府迫之無法居留而後已、捷克官方人士對於葡國此種行動、至為駭異、政界人士則以為、捷克拒不允許軍火輸往葡國、係恐違反西班牙內戰不干涉協定之所致、此說完全不確、蓋此項軍火訂購談判開始之際、曾獲得倫敦調整委員會之許可、且葡國向捷克廠家訂購軍火、實由捷克政府從中介紹也云云、（中央社十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>漢奸殺頭</h3>
<p>誤認漢奸　亦應注意</p>
<p>顧英林昨梟首</p>
<p>漢奸顧英林、年約廿餘歲、阜賓人、前日竟潛至浦東周浦鎮刺探軍情並肆搗亂後方、為富地警圍所擭、抄出證物鞠訊確實、已於昨日下午梟首示眾、並以首級縣於電桿上標明罪狀，人心大快</p>

        <h1>1937.08.20</h1>
<h3>Our Troops Occupy Wayside Wharf, Enemy Forces Entirely Cut Off</h3>
<p>Fierce Battle for Three Hours, Enemy Collapses and Flees to the Riverbank – The Turtle in the Jar Can Be Completely Eliminated – Fierce Fighting in Liuhe Last Night, Enemy Troops Fled in Defeat</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Official announcement at 1:00 AM on the 19th: At 7:00 PM this afternoon, a unit of one of our divisions launched a surprise attack in the Yangshupu area. The enemy continuously sent reinforcements and used aircraft for constant bombing. Our troops fought valiantly, engaging in close combat, and after three hours of fierce fighting, repelled the enemy. The enemy was in extreme disarray, fleeing toward the Huangpu River. Our troops have occupied Kunming Road, Yuezhou Road, Tangshan Road, etc., and are continuing to advance towards Broadway Road. Another unit has also occupied Wayside Wharf. In this battle, the enemy suffered hundreds of casualties, while our troops suffered only a dozen or so. Many military supplies were seized. Currently, these enemy troops have been forced to the Huangpu River and have become a turtle in a jar, which can be completely eliminated. (Reporter's note: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, our troops have been brave and spirited, repeatedly inflicting heavy blows on the enemy and repeatedly occupying strategically important enemy positions. After occupying the enemy naval training ground on the 17th, the enemy troops completely retreated into the concession, and the occupied area became increasingly smaller, forming a large encirclement by us. Furthermore, their east and west lines of battle formed a right angle, with the risk of being cut off at any time. After retaking Wayside Wharf yesterday, the enemy troops were completely cut off by us and lost contact, marking the greatest victory since the start of the operation. The date for eliminating the remaining enemies should not be far off.)</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Confirmed news: Yesterday afternoon, our troops constructed defensive works at the intersection of Kunming Road and Tangshan Road and the surrounding area, indicating that progress on the central front is very rapid.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Military news: After our troops occupied the enemy naval training ground on the 17th, the front line once advanced towards Dongyouheng Road, Dong Hanbili Road, etc. However, as our troops had been fighting continuously for days, they were inevitably exhausted, so they took a brief rest and did not advance further. Yesterday afternoon, an attack order was issued. Our troops, taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness, launched a surprise attack at 7:00 PM. Under the cover of machine guns, they advanced into the enemy's position with hand grenades. The remaining enemies were extremely panicked. Although they continuously sent reinforcements, they were ultimately no match for our elite troops, collapsing at the sight of them. Our troops went down in one go, passing Yuezhou Road, Tangshan Road, Kunming Road, etc., and occupied Wayside Wharf at 10:00 PM. The enemy troops completely lost their morale and were in extreme disarray.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Sneak Landing at Liuhe Defeated</h3>
<p>Fierce Battle for Three Hours, Enemy Suffers More Than Half Casualties – Our Deployment is Extremely Thorough, Guaranteeing No Mistakes</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) According to reliable news from Liuhe, last night more than ten Japanese warships carrying over a thousand Japanese soldiers, divided among many steamships, attempted to land under the cover of heavy artillery. Our troops were well prepared. When the enemy approached the shore, they immediately opened fire and machine-gunned them. The two sides exchanged fire for about three hours. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated. In this battle, our troops' attack and defense were effective, and the damage was extremely light. It is rumored that large numbers of Japanese troops will be sent to Liuhe, Yanglinkou, and other places today or tomorrow to attempt a sneak landing, and a major battle is expected to begin soon.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, the enemy troops have suffered repeated defeats, sustaining great injuries and greatly diminishing their morale. They are now planning to transport three divisions from their homeland to Shanghai. However, given that the remaining enemies in Shanghai have a narrow battle line and all the docks have been destroyed, they plan to use aircraft cover and land at Liuhe to make a desperate last stand. However, our troops, drawing on the experience of the failure of the January 28th Incident, have already deployed strong forces in Liuhe and built strong fortifications. If the enemy attacks, they will be severely attacked. It is heard that about twelve enemy ships and four empty merchant ships are anchored near Bailonggang, and they have not moved for several days, seemingly preparing for the retreat of the remaining enemies.</p>
<h3>Inspection of the Foremost Front Lines</h3>
<p>Zhabei Area in Stalemate and Confrontation – Extremely Rapid Progress on the Central and Eastern Routes</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) In order to understand the situation of our troops' positions in the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas, a reporter from this newspaper went to the front line for investigation yesterday morning. After being introduced by a rear-area military officer and guided by frontline soldiers, he arrived at around 10:00 AM and met a senior officer commanding operations on the front line. He spoke in detail about the situation on the front line and the battles in recent days, and pointed out the enemy and our troops' lines of battle on a military map. It is said that in the Zhabei area, along the Songhu Line north to Baziqiao, our troops' positions are very solid, but they are unwilling to advance too quickly, as the terrain in that section is not suitable for rapid advance, especially the southern area, which is close to the concession and should not be approached too closely. From Baziqiao north to the Jiangwan Road area, our troops are in a very advantageous position. Although the enemy troops have repeatedly attacked, they have all been repelled by us. In recent days, the enemy troops have not tried to come forward, so both sides have been in a stalemate and confrontation for the past two days. After being severely attacked by our side several times, the enemy troops are extremely cowardly due to heavy losses. Fearing our troops' attack, they remain stationary during the day and use a small number of troops under the cover of artillery to harass us at night. However, once our side responds, they retreat. However, the attack last night (the 18th) was very fierce. After 8:00 PM, the enemy troops gathered about a thousand people and first used concentrated artillery fire to bombard our side, and then sent out more than ten tanks to charge and attack our northern line of battle. After our troops bravely fought back and inflicted a heavy blow on them, a fierce battle lasted for several hours before the enemy collapsed in disarray, suffering more than half casualties. Therefore, along Jiangwan Road north of the enemy's headquarters, corpses were everywhere. Furthermore, our troops' front line is only a few hundred meters away from the enemy's headquarters, so these corpses have not been dared to approach and move away so far. The reporter also inquired about the progress of our troops on the eastern route. It is said that from Yangshupu, Jun'gong Road to the Japanese naval training ground west to the Hongkou Park area, all have been recovered by our troops one after another. The enemy has completely retreated into the eastern district concession, and there is no trace of the enemy in the Chinese area. However, the detailed situation is not very clear. Finally, the reporter requested that someone be sent to accompany him to the [missing text] Bridge [missing text] to inspect, but he said that the front line is very close to the enemy troops, and not only rifles can reach, but even wooden-shell guns can be effective, so please do not go to avoid danger. The reporter then said goodbye and returned.</p>
<h3>Izumo Shifts Further East</h3>
<p>Sails to Waters Near Yangshupu and Anchors – Enemy Uses Small Gunboats to Provide Cover Every Night</p>
<p>The Japanese Third Fleet flagship Izumo, since its stern's engine was damaged after being attacked by our special explosive device on the night of the 17th, also had a hole blasted in the starboard side of the stern. The ship secretly moved to the second and third river mooring buoys on the morning of the 18th to be repaired urgently. In addition to setting up a double electric net on all four sides, it also sent many small warships and small fireboats to surround the ship to prevent our troops from attacking. At midnight on the 18th, after our artillery team repelled the enemy's attempted sneak landing,</p>
<p>they again bombarded the ship. The two sides exchanged fire fiercely. By the morning of the 19th, the Izumo did not dare to stay at the second and third river mooring buoys, so it quietly moved further east, gradually anchoring towards Yangshupu. Another light cruiser, whose name had been erased, was sent to dock in front of the Gonghexiang Wharf, intending to remotely protect the Izumo. It is also confirmed that two small Japanese gunboats, originally docked near the Mitsui Wharf in Pudong, would sail to the side of the Water Hotel next to the Bund Park after 8:00 PM every night to protect the Izumo flagship and the 21st destroyer parked nearby, and then return to their original locations at dawn. This happens every night without interruption.</p>
<p>Enemy Suddenly Prohibits Night Navigation</p>
<p>The Japanese naval authorities in Shanghai suddenly notified the parties concerned yesterday, requesting that from 7:00 PM last night to 5:00 AM this morning, no ships are allowed to pass through the section of the Huangpu River from buoy number one to buoy number ten, that is, from Waibaidu Bridge to Osaka Wharf in Yangshupu. If foreign ships want to pass through that area, they must notify the Japanese naval authorities in Shanghai in advance and obtain permission before they can sail. The intention behind this is difficult to guess. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Total Number of Enemy Warships in Huangpu River</p>
<p>The total number of Japanese warships anchored in the Huangpu River the day before yesterday was twenty-six. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to the reporter's investigation, twelve Japanese warships had sailed out of the harbor yesterday, and there are currently fourteen warships anchored in the Huangpu River. It is also confirmed that there are currently twenty-five destroyers, five large cruisers, and two aircraft carriers anchored outside the Wusongkou. Each aircraft carrier carries about eighty aircraft. One of them is particularly large, with a three-layer partition, allowing aircraft to take off freely.</p>
<p>Enemy Searches Our Customs Ship</p>
<p>The Customs ship Fuxing, after the enemy troops started the war, moved to the Waipu area outside the Xinkai River in the French Concession to avoid danger. However, the enemy troops suspected that there were ambushes on the ship, so at 10:00 AM yesterday, they sent two gasoline boats, fully loaded with dozens of Japanese soldiers, and a small gunboat in the rear for cover, to illegally board the ship and demand a search. After the captain firmly refused, the search lasted for a quarter of an hour and nothing was found, and they left in shame.</p>
<p>Enemy Ships Go Out at Night and Come Back</p>
<p>The two enemy destroyers anchored in the Yangjing area outside the ocean and in front of the consulate have been bombarded by our air force for days. Yesterday, they fled to Yangshupu and dared not stay in their original location. However, after 9:00 PM at night, the Japanese warships still secretly sailed to the front of the Japanese Consulate and anchored, and then sailed east after dawn.</p>
<h3>Foreign Newspapers Report Our Troops' Victory</h3>
<p>Our New Line of Battle Has Been Well Organized – Repeated Counterattacks by Japan Have Proven to Be Failures</p>
<p>Shanghai Times reports: Judging from the attack by the Chinese army yesterday morning (the 18th), it is clear that they have received strong support, because although the Japanese army bombarded and attacked with aircraft all day long, they were unable to repel them. This is enough to prove that the Chinese army's new line of battle has been well organized. The Chinese army's attack is very orderly. Observers claim that its advance is planned by those with military knowledge. It is only regrettable that the supporting artillery and anti-aircraft artillery forces are still insufficient, otherwise the progress could be smoother. The various factories occupied by the Chinese army, except for military reasons, are never damaged. According to a certain observer who inspected the sections occupied by the Chinese army yesterday, the Chinese soldiers strictly abide by discipline and have no looting behavior. After the Chinese army arrived in Shanghai, they were quite disappointed because they did not start the war immediately. Now their morale is very strong, and they are quietly waiting for the enemy's counterattack. This can be proved by one thing: yesterday afternoon, although Japanese aircraft dropped bombs like rain, bombing the new position of the Chinese army, the Chinese army did not retreat an inch. In retaliation for the Japanese army's air raid yesterday morning, the Chinese army fired artillery shells at Hongkou District from Jiangwan, and many shells hit the target, causing fires in several places that lasted for a long time. Several shells also hit the barracks near the Japanese army and caused a fire, but whether it was the Japanese army headquarters could not be ascertained. Six Japanese ships berthed at the Nissin Company's Pudong Wharf were occupied by the Chinese army and sank at the sealing point in Nanshi. Although two small Japanese destroyers rushed to rescue them, they could not do anything. According to the Japanese naval authorities, these ships are worth a total of 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>North China Daily News reports: On Tuesday, the Chinese army broke through the Japanese army's line of battle near Taopeng Road and advanced to Huade Road. The two sides then fought fiercely. At dawn, the light of the Chinese army's new position was detected by the Japanese cruisers in the river, which then bombarded it fiercely. The Japanese army also carried out a counterattack. Although the Japanese army claimed to have regained the lost ground, judging from the situation, even if they can advance slightly, they will never be able to regain all of it. The Japanese army also claimed to have regained the lost ground in the Yangshupu area that was lost on Tuesday, but judging from the sound of artillery that awakened the residents of the concession last night, this statement is highly dubious, because the artillery was fired from both sides last night. If the Chinese army had been driven out of the Yangshupu area, how could the Chinese army have fiercely attacked from the Yangshupu area, causing the Japanese warships to bombard it? After the Chinese army went deep into the Yangshupu area the night before, they have now advanced to near the British American Tobacco Company's warehouse. When passing by the warehouse, the Chinese workers in the warehouse welcomed them and gave them cigarettes from the walls.</p>
<h3>Situation in Pudong Still Peaceful</h3>
<p>Part of the Japanese-Chinese Cotton Mill Has Been Burned Down – Enemy's Attempt to Land in the Yangjing Area Has Failed</p>
<p>There were still intermittent artillery battles between the enemy warships in the Huangpu River and our troops stationed in Pudong last night, but they were not as fierce as the previous two nights. The sound of artillery was heard from time to time, and after 9:00 PM in the evening, there would be several artillery shells every hour, mixed with dense machine gun fire, which was to clear out the remaining enemy troops and plainclothes men who had landed ashore.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The enemy troops were defeated in Hongkou and their position was shrinking day by day. They are planning to attack towards Pudong, hoping to occupy a position and remotely support the counterattack of their remaining troops. Therefore, the enemy and our troops have been engaged in fierce battles across the river every evening. In order to understand the situation there, the reporter visited Pudong. At the ferry crossing, he saw refugees carrying boxes and luggage, all in a hurry and worried. Several Japanese planes were circling in the sky, frequently strafing with machine guns. The area around Lan'nidu Street in Pudong, which used to be prosperous, is now mostly empty. However, because the defense regiments are closely guarded, the order is very good. The shops on the main streets opened yesterday morning, but business was slow. Some people sat in groups playing mahjong in the sound of gunfire, which can be said to be extremely calm. Passing by the Japanese-Chinese Cotton Mill, part of the front factory building had been on fire and was still smoking. The warehouses were all closed, and no enemy troops were stationed there. It was also heard that the owner of the factory had two sons who had been conscripted to North China and died in battle. When he was finally conscripted himself, he closed the factory and threw himself into the Huangpu River and committed suicide. He then visited the commander of the defending troops and talked in detail about the situation in the area. According to him, since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, although the enemy's main force has attacked towards Zhabei, our defense of Pudong has not been relaxed at all. The enemy did try to attack east after failing to attack west. On the 16th and 18th nights, the enemy ships attacked, but they were repelled after a calm response. We also used heavy artillery to bombard them, and all were able to hit the target. The enemy's plan failed, so they frequently used aircraft to scout, bomb, or strafe with machine guns. Our side suffered no losses. He then said that the organization of the rear in Pudong is not yet complete, and there are no good hospitals, making it difficult to treat the wounded. He hopes that the people of Shanghai will enthusiastically provide assistance. The soldiers on the front line also need two medicine kits and biscuits, and hope that all parties will donate.</p>
<p>The enemy in the Yangjing area of Pudong has repeatedly attempted to land at the New Mitsui, Old Mitsui wharves, and the Japanese-Chinese Cotton Mill, but has ultimately been repelled by our troops. The Japanese-Chinese Cotton Mill was hit by a shell and caught fire the night before, burning down part of it. The Mitsui Wharf has also been destroyed, so the enemy has no way to land. However, our troops are still on high alert. The Yangjing area is now very safe, and the maintenance of order in the rear is mostly due to the defense regiments in the area.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Enemy Reinforcements Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Total Number of Reinforcements is Three Divisions – Where They Land is Worth Noting</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, a week has passed. Our troops have been winning victories one after another, and the entire line has been advancing rapidly. The enemy's morale is low and they are trapped in a large encirclement. Therefore, they have urgently transferred reinforcements to Shanghai. It is reported that one enemy division has arrived yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, twenty-five transport ships and destroyers transported them to Shanghai and arrived outside Wusongkou, and they plan to find a way to land immediately. It is heard that another division is also continuing to depart. Most of the wharves in eastern Shanghai have been destroyed by our artillery fire, and the Hongkou area is small, making it difficult to accommodate such a large number of enemy troops. Therefore, where they land is a matter of great concern.</p>
<p>North China Daily News reports: Last night (the 18th), according to reliable sources, three Japanese divisions, totaling about 60,000 people, will arrive in Shanghai in the next few days. The first batch can be created this morning, the second batch will arrive in one or two days, and the arrival date of the third batch is unknown.</p>
<p>English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports: It is heard that ten Japanese transport ships arrived outside Wusongkou this morning (the 19th). Within a few days, two divisions of Japanese standing troops, about 50,000 people, some of whom participated in the January 28th Incident, will land to assist in the battle. In the January 28th Incident, Japan used 50,000 troops to repel the 19th Route Army. This time, the Chinese army's strength is greater than that of the 19th Route Army. In the January 28th Incident, the Japanese army succeeded by landing secretly in Liuhe. Yesterday, foreign observers behind the Chinese army's line claimed that the Japanese army's attempt to land in Liuhe had failed and that the Chinese army had built very solid defenses there.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Yesterday morning, our troops continued to attack. By 12:00 noon, our troops in the central route had advanced to the end of Qimei Road, and the Yuezhou Road and Tangshan Road area. The enemy troops were unable to hold on and had all retreated into the concession. Our troops' artillery fire in the southern part of eastern Shanghai is now concentrated on the Wayside Wharf area, hoping to completely cut off the enemy's right and left flank positions in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Enemy's Attack on Wusong Suffers Damage and Retreats</p>
<p>The enemy troops in Wusong, at around 8:40 AM yesterday morning, attempted to attack our position under the cover of heavy artillery. Fortunately, our defensive works had already been built strongly, and our artillery team met them with a head-on blow, finally causing the enemy to suffer heavy damage and retreat. The sound of artillery was loud and could be heard clearly in the concession. Afterwards, several houses were hit by shells and caught fire, lasting for several hours. According to news from a foreign ship that sailed to Shanghai the night before, the ship saw traces of artillery bombardment when passing through Wusong, and the buildings of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were also full of bullet holes. However, Shanghai University still stands tall, and the Jardine Matheson buildings seem to be undamaged.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Enemies Killed at Qiujiang Wharf</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Since the Shanghai battle, the enemy troops have suffered repeated defeats, and their position has been shrinking. They are about to be trapped in a desperate situation. They have repeatedly planned to land in Pudong to expand their operational base, but have been repelled by our troops. According to official news, the night before (the 18th), more than 300 enemy troops again planned to land at Qiujiang Wharf. Our side, upon receiving the news, pretended not to know and waited calmly. When the enemy troops approached the wharf, they launched a surprise attack with bravery. The enemy troops were caught off guard and panicked. All of them were eliminated by us, and our side suffered only a dozen or so casualties.</p>
<p>Enemy's Attack on North Station Repelled</p>
<p>On the night of the 18th, the enemy used a large amount of artillery fire to bombard our North Station position violently. The infantry also charged and attacked. Our troops braved bullets and bathed in blood, fighting back bravely, and finally repelled the enemy troops. The enemy south of North Station did not dare to attack again.</p>
<p>One enemy route launched a fierce counterattack against us from Baisha Jinggang at 7:00 PM on the 18th. Our troops bravely fought back head-on, and as a result, the enemy on that route was unable to hold on and retreated. In this battle, more than twenty enemies were killed, one light machine gun and more than twenty small military flags were seized.</p>
<p>The enemy troops' position near the Japanese brewery was hit by our artillery fire and caught fire at 7:00 PM on the 18th. The flames were fierce and lasted for more than an hour before they were extinguished. Our troops' morale is very high and they are waiting for an opportunity to attack that location.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: About 2,000 enemy troops in the Hongkou area launched a counterattack against the Japanese naval club, which we had occupied, at 5:00 PM on the 18th. After our troops fought back, a fierce battle lasted for an hour. The enemy, under the cover of aircraft, launched several attacks, but were all repelled by our troops. As a result, the enemy suffered more than 800 casualties, and our side suffered very light casualties. Afterwards, we also intercepted a large number of enemy guns and ammunition.</p>
<h3>All Countries' Warships and Merchant Vessels Must Stay Five Nautical Miles Away from Japanese Warships Within Twelve Hours</h3>
<p>Otherwise, Our Country Will Not Be Responsible for Any Damage Incurred During Our Attack on Japanese Warships. It Is Shameful for the Enemy to Use American Warships as Cover. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Notified Various Countries' Envoys and Consuls Yesterday Afternoon at 3 PM</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified various countries' envoys and consuls that all countries' warships and merchant vessels in Shanghai must, within twelve hours, stay five nautical miles away from the location where Japanese warships are docked, or ensure that Japanese warships stay five nautical miles away from the location where various countries' warships and merchant vessels are docked. Otherwise, during the Chinese Air Force's and other military forces' attacks on Japanese warships, China will not be responsible for any damage incurred by third-country warships and merchant vessels. At the same time, an urgent telegram was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Office in Shanghai, instructing it to notify the various countries' consulates in Shanghai. After receiving the order, Mr. Yu Ming, the director of the Foreign Affairs Office, immediately notified the various countries' consuls-general in Shanghai by telephone that evening and also delivered written notices to the various countries' consulates-general in Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 19th, since the Japanese troops in Shanghai unilaterally initiated an attack on our security forces, and we were compelled to resist, Japanese warships have often deliberately docked alongside European and American warships or merchant vessels. This forces our side to consider the safety of third parties' lives and property, making it inconvenient to attack freely. The Japanese, on the other hand, take advantage of their superior position to bombard our positions with artillery. The troops at our front lines are deeply angered and indignant at this situation, believing that the Japanese are relying on the power of foreigners, which is cowardly and contemptible. Moreover, the European and American warships and merchant vessels, by not forcing the Japanese warships to move away, are in effect providing protection to the Japanese warships, placing our military in a disadvantageous position, which is not fair. It is reported that our military authorities notified the British, American, French, and Italian envoys to China on the 19th, requesting them to instruct their respective countries' warships and merchant vessels in Shanghai to sail at least five nautical miles away from Japanese warships, or to order the Japanese warships to sail to the same distance from their warships or merchant vessels. If the above request is not complied with within twelve hours, then when the Chinese Air Force or other armed forces clash with Japanese warships, China will not bear any responsibility for damage to the warships or merchant vessels of those countries.</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Regarding the Chinese military's self-defense actions in Shanghai, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement on the 19th: The Chinese troops in Shanghai and other locations are currently engaged in self-defense against violence. This self-defense action is to resist countries that are invading Chinese territory and destroying treaties maintaining peace, such as the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. In terms of fairness, the self-defending country should enjoy at least the same legal combat opportunities as the aggressor in such a war. Before the conflict in Shanghai occurred, the Chinese government had already stated to various countries that if Japanese troops use any part of the International Settlement as a base for combat or a place of retreat, then Chinese self-defense troops will be compelled to take all necessary measures to deal with Japanese combat personnel within the Settlement, and the Chinese government will absolutely not be responsible for all consequences arising therefrom. Currently, Japanese troops are still using Hongkou and Yangshupu as bases for attack. Many Japanese warships in Wusongkou and the Huangpu River continue to bombard Chinese positions. When the Chinese Air Force attacked these warships, they disregarded their own danger and were particularly careful to avoid unnecessary damage and danger to the ships and property of third countries. Up to now, Chinese aircraft have not intentionally attacked any other foreign warships or property, and this will continue to be the case in the future. However, if, because foreign warships are too close to Japanese warships, unavoidable dangers occur during Chinese Air Force operations, the Chinese government cannot be held responsible. Therefore, the most appropriate solution is for the countries concerned to find a way to make the Japanese warships leave the Huangpu River, or for those countries to sail all their warships and other vessels out of the danger zone themselves. The Chinese government's above proposal is just and fair, and it is believed that it will be easily understood and sympathized with. Moreover, the purpose of our struggle is not only for the security of Chinese territory, but also for the maintenance of justice in the world. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>It is also reported that during the artillery battle on the night of the 18th, a Japanese warship moved to the vicinity of the American flagship USS Augusta in the dark, using the American warship as cover to fire artillery shells at our Pudong positions. For the sake of the safety of neutral countries, our army did not return fire at the time. When reporters asked Mayor Yu about this matter, he stated that such stealthy behavior by the Japanese warship completely disregarded the safety of neutral countries' fleets and was extremely shameful. If the fleets of neutral countries are still used by the Japanese and do not stop them when our army retaliates in self-defense in the future, then our side will not be responsible for any damages incurred.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Bombs Enemy Aircraft Carrier</h3>
<p>Several Locations on Broadway Road Hit. Enemy Planes Sortie Again Yesterday to Drop Bombs. Part of Jinan University's School Buildings Destroyed</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to the Air Force Headquarters, one Chinese bomber bombed a Japanese aircraft carrier outside of Wusongkou this morning, hitting its bow. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>The air raid situation on both sides yesterday is briefly summarized as follows: Starting at 6 AM, a large squadron of our Air Force planes flew to the Japanese-held areas of Wusong Road and East Broadway Road to carry out bombing raids, dropping more than ten bombs. Several locations were hit and caught fire, burning fiercely. The enemy suffered heavy losses. Around 8 AM, several enemy seaplanes flew to Pudong, Zhabei, and the Nanshi areas for reconnaissance. Around 10 AM, eighteen enemy planes flew to the Zhenru and Nanxiang areas to drop bombs. In Nanxiang, they dropped bombs on the Nanxiang Red Cross Rescue Station, injuring two of our wounded soldiers and one doctor. They also destroyed the attached middle school dormitory of Jinan University in Zhenru, killing Feng Xuegui, a member of the school's wartime service corps, and injuring Huang Shihua (arm amputated). The railway tracks near the station were also bombed and destroyed for more than ten zhang (a Chinese unit of length). Our garrison used anti-aircraft artillery and other means to bombard the enemy planes, and the enemy planes then took off and fled. At around 11 AM, three more enemy planes flew over Pudong, Zhabei, Nanshi, and Longhua Airport to circle and conduct reconnaissance, and dropped bombs in Zhabei and other places. Houses in that area caught fire and had not been extinguished by noon. At around 2 PM, two enemy planes again conducted reconnaissance in the Gaochangmiao area of Nanshi. At around 4 PM, twelve more enemy planes, divided into four teams, dropped bombs in Pudong. After our attack, they flew back to the skies above the Huangpu River to circle. Our losses were very small.</p>
<p>Detailed Report on the Inspection of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at dawn, a large squadron of more than twenty enemy planes flew around the skies above Zhenru, Dachang, and Nanxiang, carrying out heavy bombing. The sound of their swooping and soaring planes was heard far and wide. The Shanghai-Nanjing railway tracks in front of Jinan University were hit by bombs, destroying more than ten zhang of the tracks, creating a huge pit. In the Nanxiang area, the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway was also bombed and destroyed, but it was quickly repaired. In the Dachang area, many civilian houses were destroyed, and telephone poles and wires were also damaged, but they were quickly repaired. After learning of this situation, at around 1 PM yesterday afternoon, reporters from our newspaper, accompanied by two companions, took a car along the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway to investigate. As expected, there were many places bombed along the way, with the tracks at Zhenru Station being the most severely damaged. In the Nanxiang area, the fields were full of craters, all caused by the enemy's bombs. At that time, the three reporters carefully examined the road and carefully reviewed the extent of the damage and the weight of the enemy bombs at each bombed location. It was not until 3 PM that it was completed. On the way back in the same car, when the car was about six or seven li (a Chinese unit of distance) away from Nanxiang, three enemy planes suddenly appeared in the sky, one for reconnaissance and the rest for bombing, chasing the car the reporters were in. Seeing that there was no way to move forward, the three reporters and the driver hurriedly abandoned the car and took temporary shelter in the nearby fields. Unexpectedly, the enemy planes took the four of them as their target and bombed repeatedly within about fifty meters of where they were hiding, a total of eight times. Although the bombed locations were very close, none of them were harmed and returned safely, which can be considered fortunate.</p>
<p>One Student Killed in Jinan University Bombing</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 6 PM, several Japanese planes flew to Zhenru to bomb the National Jinan University, dropping many bombs. The school's auditorium, science building, middle school department, classrooms, etc., all suffered considerable damage. A certain middle school student was killed on the spot by the bombing. The Japanese army aims to destroy. Distant schools such as Nankai University in Tianjin, and nearby schools such as Shanghai's Shanghai University, and Aurora University in Yangshupu, have all been subjected to their artillery fire. The sacred cultural cause has suffered such hardships, which shows the enemy's malicious intentions.</p>
<p>Longhua Airport Not Damaged</p>
<p>Longhua Airport was bombed repeatedly by enemy planes yesterday, but our losses were minimal. At 6 PM and 8:40 PM, several more enemy planes came and dropped several bombs, which landed in the airport but did not explode. In the morning bombing, the houses of the Eurasia Company and the parking lot caught fire immediately. The Caoxing and Huangyuan fire brigades, together with the Dongjiadu Fire Administration, came to the rescue. Unexpectedly, the enemy planes used machine guns to strafe downwards. Fortunately, the firefighters dodged successfully and were not injured. However, two villagers in Longhua East Street were hit by stray bullets. Twelve enemy planes, starting at 7:30 AM, flew to Zhabei, Zhenru, Gaoqiao, Dachang and other places to drop bombs, a total of more than thirty bombs, none of which hit the target. From 4:40 PM to 6:20 PM last night, our North Station water tower was also bombed.</p>
<p>Pudong Bombed Again Yesterday with Several Bombs</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, a team of Japanese bombers, escorted by six or seven fighter planes, a total of fourteen planes, circled over Xinma Road in Pudong several times before continuously dropping three bombs. One bomb landed in the Gu family garden at the south end of Shenjia Lane, causing no damage. One bomb landed at the west end of Shenjia Lane, destroying three or four bungalows, including a hardware store next to the Pan family's firewood shop. The people in the store had already fled far away, so there were no casualties. A bomb landed in the fields of East Shenjia Lane, splashing mud and dust. Our army used machine guns to fire into the air, and the enemy planes fled in disorder. Judging from their bombing target, it seemed they were trying to destroy Bridge No. 5 on our Xinma Road, but because their goal was not achieved, three more planes came at 4:50 PM and dropped a bomb in the fields next to Xinma Road. We still suffered no damage. The enemy planes, seeing our army's intense firing, fled in a hurry.</p>
<p>Jiangyin Actually Bombed with Poison Gas Bombs</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy troops invading Shanghai, having been dealt a head-on blow by us and forced to retreat step by step, have been terrified and lack the will to fight. In the past two days, they have relied on their planes and artillery to wantonly bomb and slaughter, in an attempt to disrupt our rear and salvage the situation, but we have firmly established our positions and will not be moved. From 8 AM to 9 AM yesterday, several more enemy planes flew to Jiangyin and actually dropped several poison gas bombs. Fortunately, our authorities had made thorough preparations, so there were no losses. However, the enemy troops' inhumane behavior further exposes their murderous bestiality. Also, according to reliable reports received by military agencies yesterday, from 8 AM to 9 AM yesterday, several enemy planes flew over Jiangyin and dropped a large number of poison gas bombs. The extent of the damage is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>One Enemy Plane Night Attack Destroyed</p>
<p>The night before last (the 18th), at about 9 PM, in the bright moonlight, two enemy planes dropped bombs and bombed in Zhabei and other places, causing fires to burn in many civilian houses. They then flew to the skies above Nanshi Longhua. Our garrison immediately used anti-aircraft artillery machine guns to fire at the enemy planes. Bullets flashed in the sky. At times, one enemy plane was hit and fled, flying towards western Shanghai. This morning, it was learned that the plane had been found near Zhongshan Road, its fuselage completely destroyed and the two pilots dead. According to the North China Daily News, at about 9:30 PM last night, a plane was forced to land at Zhaofeng Road Park. Which side it belongs to is still unknown.</p>

<p>[Baoding] After our army, with great sacrifice, defeated the enemy at Nankou, the enemy then turned to attack our Huanglaoyuan area with fierce artillery fire, firing as many as four or five thousand rounds, the intensity of the attack unprecedented. Our officers and soldiers held the great spirit that "If I don't kill the enemy, the enemy will kill me" and sacrificed themselves for the country, fighting the enemy in bloody battles, falling one after another, heroically. After three days and nights of hand-to-hand combat, the enemy reinforced several times. As a result, our army completely repelled the stubborn enemy on the morning of the 19th, and we are now firmly defending the original position, confronting the enemy. The defeated enemy, having repeatedly failed to attack this area, is now changing its plan, attempting to attack Nankou again. However, our morale is a hundred times higher, and the position is extremely solid. The defeated enemy, if it attacks again, will inevitably be completely annihilated.

<p>[Baoding] According to reports, dozens of enemies in Caoxinzhuang, east of our Gu'an County, tried to cross the Yongding River in three groups on the 18th. They were met with a head-on blow by our army. They then attempted to cross forcibly towards Majiatun, but were also completely repelled by us. The enemy's intention is probably to predict the depth of the river and the strength of our guarding forces. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<h3>Britain, America, and France Decide to Adopt a Firm Policy Towards the Shanghai War</h3>
<p>To Make Every Effort to Protect Lives and Property in the Settlements. The United States' Dispatch of Troops to Shanghai Draws Attention</p>
<p>[London] The Associated Press learned today from authoritative sources that the British government will never abandon British commercial and economic interests in Shanghai under any circumstances. The Daily Mail reported that the Cabinet has considered sending additional troops to Shanghai. (National News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>[London] The rumors spread in recent days that British residents in Shanghai intend to withdraw completely have caused unnecessary panic. Responsible parties have firmly denied this, saying that the British government will not only allow British residents in Shanghai to take care of their interests but will also provide them with firm protection. Only those British residents who wish to leave Shanghai or should leave Shanghai will be transferred to Hong Kong. The communique issued after the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday will prove everything, namely that the British government will take all possible measures to protect the lives and interests of British residents. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>[London] According to the Washington correspondent of the London Morning Post, cooperation between the United States and the powers in the Far East has encountered some political difficulties. The full impact of sending the Navy to Shanghai has not yet been clarified, but if this matter passes without strong opposition, the position of the administration will become more consolidated, and it can proceed with its strict policy in the Far East. In addition to deciding to increase troops, it has also decided not to give up a single dollar of interest or a fraction of dignity under Japanese pressure. If Japanese troops occupy Shanghai in the future, and international troops cannot maintain order in Shanghai, then Japan's arbitrary interference in local laws and order will be inexcusable. In short, the United States will never give up its power and interests in the Far East in the future. President Roosevelt is particularly concerned that the outside world should not regard the United States as a declining nation. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" published a commentary yesterday, saying, "We were heartened to hear that 1,100 members of the United States Navy have been ordered to come to Shanghai from the naval base in San Diego to protect lives and property. We hope that this army can fly here along the Pacific air route. This move by the American authorities is not only a major event at present, but also an important page in history, which proves that the American flag will stand firmly here. In short, the arrival of the American army is not to handle the aftermath of the evacuation of overseas Chinese, but to announce to the world that the United States will be a key player in the situation in the Far East. For this reason, this news is not only worth writing about in a big way, but also gives us new confidence and new courage. Those who believe that the United States should not quietly give up its rights and interests can also be comforted. We do not know where this change comes from, but since it has been seen in fact, it seems to be true. This army will probably not use force, but its deployment here is enough to prove that the United States has adopted a firm policy, which is supported by everyone. Sometimes this kind of expression is really necessary, and today is the time when it is necessary."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Security Issue: British Proposal for Mediation</h3>
<p>Demanding Withdrawal of Chinese and Japanese Troops; France Agrees, US Remains Cool</p>
<p>[London] The British government still feels that the increasingly serious war between China and Japan is not beyond mediation, and that the tense situation in Shanghai should be resolved immediately. To ensure the safety of the International Settlement, troops should be redeployed with the agreement of both countries. Regarding the cessation of the crisis in Shanghai, British diplomatic authorities have repeatedly consulted with the consuls and military authorities of various countries in Shanghai, as well as the Chinese and Japanese governments, in recent days. As a result, concrete proposals have been put forward to the Chinese and Japanese governments through diplomatic channels. The details of the proposals are not yet known, but the plan to separate the International Settlement from the Sino-Japanese war zone should include the following key points: ㊀ Mutual agreement that both Chinese and Japanese naval and land forces jointly withdraw from the area surrounding Shanghai; ㊁ Assurance to Japan of the safety of its expatriates, and assurance to China that the Japanese side will not use the International Settlement as a base of operations; the responsibility for protecting Japanese expatriates will be jointly undertaken by the troops of various countries within the Settlement. Currently, the British authorities in Shanghai have decided to evacuate as a priority non-essential expatriates, mostly women and children, who would be exposed to danger. The US authorities are also doing the same, but most British expatriates, due to their business interests, are unable to leave. Therefore, it has been decided to take effective measures to protect expatriates and their interests. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Paris] The French government has notified its ambassadors to China and Japan, stating that France has accepted the British peace plan. Once the governments of the countries concerned have agreed to the British proposal in principle, the ambassadors of the various countries will jointly negotiate with China and Japan. At that time, the ambassadors will have the authority to discuss implementation measures on the spot. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the British government's proposal for a joint negotiation with the Chinese and Japanese governments, demanding that both sides withdraw their troops from the vicinity of the Shanghai concessions, the French government has accepted it and immediately instructed its ambassadors in China and Japan to present the proposal to the governments of their respective countries. However, regarding the protection of the interests of both China and Japan in the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession by Britain and France, negotiations with China and Japan will only commence after both sides have reached an agreement in principle. (Central News Agency, 19th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Washington] People here are quite cold to the British proposal to establish a neutral zone around Shanghai, feeling that any proposal put forward by foreign countries at this time will not have any influence on China or Japan. However, Hull himself has not commented on this plan. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] The British government has notified the Italian government. It is reported that the Italian Chargé d'Affaires in London visited the British Foreign Office this afternoon to inquire whether Italy could join Britain, France, and the United States in protecting Japanese interests if China and Japan accept the above proposal. (18th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] The Times reports that we should not be too optimistic about the joint action taken by Britain, France, and the United States. At present, all that can be done is for the consuls of the three countries in Shanghai to maintain close contact at all times to make the steps more effective. However, when discussing new plans in the future, Japan will undoubtedly demand the protection of the lives and property of Japanese residents in Shanghai. Therefore, the future of the joint action plan is not optimistic. (19th, National Maritime Telegraph)</p>
<p>[London] According to diplomatic sources, the British government is currently negotiating with both Tokyo and Nanjing, seeking to have both China and Japan withdraw their troops from Shanghai, with Britain, France, and the United States responsible for protecting Japanese interests in the International Settlement. Once China and Japan accept this plan, Britain will contact France and the United States, requesting them to join Britain in taking responsibility for protecting Japanese interests. However, well-informed British sources believe that, according to the latest news from China and Japan, there is very little hope that the above proposal will be realized. The British government is now only making a final attempt to fulfill its responsibilities. It is also still unknown whether the United States is willing to participate. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Berlin] British and French newspapers today published in a sensational manner the news that the British and French ambassadors to Germany had talks with intelligence officers from the Chinese Embassy in Germany, considering it to be an important discussion. According to authoritative German sources, British Ambassador Henderson and French Ambassador Poncet went to the German Foreign Office to deliver notes that were merely friendly inquiries in nature, and the intelligence officers from the Chinese Embassy only held informal talks with officials from the German Foreign Office.

<h3>US Will Not Implement Neutrality Law Regarding the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Secretary of Commerce Issues Statement; China and Japan in Different Situations</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the Sino-Japanese war, US Secretary of Commerce Roper stated today that, due to the different positions of China and Japan, the United States declaring and implementing neutrality laws would be suspected of assisting one country. This is what we are unwilling to do. He also stated that in the past five months of this year, the total value of US goods shipped to China was $26,256,000, while the value of goods shipped to Japan was $140,325,000. Cotton, oil, and kerosene were the main goods shipped to Japan. If neutrality laws were implemented, whether these goods would be considered military supplies would be an important issue. Furthermore, China recently purchased six additional locomotives, which are unlikely to be affected by the war and stop operating. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of Commerce Roper recently issued a statement to the press regarding the Far East situation, stating that the US government does not intend to take any measures that would appear to favor either China or Japan. In short, the US government wishes to maintain friendly relations with all these countries, strictly adhere to a neutral stance, and is unwilling to take any measures that would incur the displeasure of China or Japan. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of Commerce Roper stated today that if the United States implements neutrality laws, it will endanger US commerce with China and Japan. Congressional Democrats today approved in the House of Representatives the allocation of US$500,000 for the relief of American expatriates in the war zone, but opposed the increase in troops. Fee stated that there are fewer than 10,000 American expatriates in China, so why send an additional 1,200 Marines to Shanghai? In reality, the United States should withdraw its naval forces from China to avoid being drawn into the war in Asia. (18th, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Hull Explains Evacuation Measures</h3>
<p>Another Battalion of British Troops Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement explaining that the US government is now doing everything possible to evacuate American expatriates from Shanghai, and stated that US officials are not only advising American women and children to leave Shanghai, but also men who do not need to stay in Shanghai to protect private interests. In addition, the US Consul in Hong Kong, in view of the fact that British expatriates in Shanghai are flocking to Hong Kong, coupled with the current epidemic there, has notified American consuls throughout the Far East to advise American expatriates not to go to Hong Kong. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull stated today that US diplomats in China are now warning American expatriates in Shanghai and other dangerous locations to evacuate if there is no need to stay. The previous evacuation advice was limited to women and children, but now it also applies to travelers, teachers, and missionaries. The State Department believes that only American engineers and diplomats at the Shanghai Water and Electric Company have sufficient and important reasons to stay. Hull expects that by the end of the week, a total of 1,700 American expatriates will have been evacuated, with approximately 2,000 remaining. (19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the export of woolen fabrics from Bradford, England, to Shanghai has almost completely stopped. One factory has completely ceased exports, while other factories have temporarily suspended or even canceled contracts with Shanghai importers. Insurance costs for goods shipped to Shanghai have now soared, which is considered too high by export merchants in various industries. In addition, some industrialists are quite uneasy about goods currently en route to Shanghai and may divert them to Hong Kong to await the end of the Shanghai war. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas)</p>
<h3>German Attention</h3>
<p>[Berlin] The German public is extremely concerned about the Shanghai war. Newspapers in Berlin and various provinces are publishing Shanghai news on the front page, expressing deep sympathy for the German sailor Gocke, who was killed in the Shanghai International Settlement, and other injured German expatriates. In addition to publishing news about the Shanghai war, newspapers are also publishing special articles by German expatriates in Shanghai to help readers become more familiar with the situation in the Shanghai war. Various groups with cultural and commercial ties to the Far East are constantly inquiring by telephone about the safety of relatives and friends in Shanghai. (19th, National Maritime Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Berlin] German newspapers are extremely concerned about the Sino-Japanese incident. Lengthy news reports from Shanghai, Nanjing, and Tokyo fill the newspapers. The general view is that this conflict is detrimental to the economic development of the Far East and the entire world, which is deeply regrettable. It also points out that the other seven signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty can only quietly observe the situation at this time. Only when Japan's actions harm the interests of the signatory countries will they intervene. The international nature of the Far East incident will become clear after Japan's objectives are revealed. According to the newspaper's speculation, Japan's objective is to create a 'buffer state' in North China. (18th, National Maritime Telegraph)</p>

<h3>British Direct Interests in China Total 250 Million Pounds</h3>
<p>Shanghai Accounts for 180 Million Pounds</p>
<p>[London] The Times diplomatic correspondent commented today on the British peace plan, saying that London circles have always believed that the main crisis for Japanese expatriates in Shanghai arose directly from the landing of Japanese troops. Today's plan is to once again make Japan choose between prestige and cooperation. Prestige means war. From London's perspective, the Shanghai situation itself is extremely dangerous and complex. No wonder people in London and elsewhere are expressing very serious anxiety about British businesses and general interests. The direct interests of British people in China are worth approximately 250 million pounds, of which 200 million pounds are investments in the business community, and the remaining 50 million pounds are government loans. Those in Shanghai amount to 180 million pounds, and a large portion of this 180 million pounds is in the concessions north of the Suzhou Creek. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Japan Swallows a Bomb for the First Time</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>During the September 18th Incident, some people said that Japan's invasion of the Eastern Provinces was equivalent to swallowing a bomb. Their words were very thought-provoking. But at that time, the bomb was not detonated and was safely swallowed. The Japanese then believed that Chinese bombs were not explosive. So, for the second time, they wanted to swallow a bomb. Unexpectedly, the second bomb exploded. It is still impossible to predict the extent of its explosive power. But after all, the wounds suffered by Japan are not trivial.</p>
<p>1. Japan using the concessions as a base for military operations is not only wrong but also extremely dangerous. The Japanese are using the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas as a base for combat, but under the heavy encirclement of our army, they have not only failed to expand but their positions are gradually shrinking. Under these circumstances, they have to find another way out. Therefore, they are trying hard to land in Pudong, Liuhang, and other places in an attempt to expand the war. But in fact, our side has long been prepared in various places, and they cannot implement their plans. The military strategy of not leaving any room for retreat is precisely this kind of situation.</p>
<p>2. Since preparing for war, Japan's monthly military expenditure has been estimated by foreign military experts to be about 17 million yuan per day. Therefore, the Japanese government has increased the military budget three times. This situation is not only unsustainable for countries lacking in financial resources, but also difficult for countries with strong financial resources to continue. In this war, Japan's economic losses are difficult to calculate in numbers. Therefore, it is in Japan's interest to fight a quick war, and it is in our interest to fight a prolonged war. As long as we can sustain it for three months or half a year, internal changes will inevitably occur in Japan. This is not only what our country can predict but also a fact known to the world.</p>
<p>3. Japan's use of the concessions as a defensive tactic not only makes it impossible for various countries to conduct business but also makes it almost impossible to guarantee public security. For example, yesterday the Japanese army surrounded the Huishan Road Police Station and Yulin Road Police Station in the eastern district of Shanghai and did not allow the personnel to evacuate. In addition, Japanese planes dropped poison gas bombs in Jiangyin and other places. These actions are mostly cruel acts that violate humanity and violate public law. If various countries are unable to stop them, the tragic consequences are truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>Japan has always called itself a civilized country, but the absurdity of its actions has reached this point. Not only is it something that our people could not have dreamed of, but it is also something that people of various countries could not have dreamed of. Japan has suffered major setbacks in the Nankou Shangdu area, and in Shanghai, it is also in a state of desperation. Who caused this tragic result? Who did it? Although we dare not boast of final victory now, this kind of exploding bomb was something that the Japanese did not expect at all.</p>

<h3>Soviet Aviation Day Air Force Drill</h3>
<p>Three Hundred Participating Aircraft</p>
<p>[Moscow] Yesterday was Soviet Aviation Day. The authorities held a large-scale air force drill at the Duchino airfield near Moscow. A total of three hundred aircraft participated, lasting three hours.

In addition, ten squadrons of fighter planes soared in formation, with excellent posture. Following them were six aircraft, each towing three gliders. After these gliders were airborne, they separated from the towing aircraft and performed in the air like ordinary aircraft. Finally, about one hundred fighter planes and bombers practiced attacking or defending an air force base, with anti-aircraft artillery units participating as well. Soviet dictator Stalin, Chairman of the People's Committee Molotov, Arctic exploration team leader Professor Schmidt, and diplomatic personnel all attended to observe.

<p>[Moscow] It is reported that thirty-four more people were executed in Irkutsk today because they were spies for Japan, stealing military secrets, plotting to destroy the East Siberian Railway, and plotting to harm important Soviet figures. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>Portugal and Czechoslovakia Sever Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>Caused by Arms Purchases</p>
<p>⊙Lisbon The Portuguese government issued an official gazette today stating that the departure of Czech Minister to Portugal, Mr. Feierle, proves the recent widespread rumors of the severance of diplomatic relations between Portugal and Czechoslovakia to be true. According to the Portuguese government, Portugal, in order to promote its military equipment plan, ordered a large number of machine guns from the Czech state-owned arms factory. The Czech government suddenly announced that it could not export the arms. This move was apparently directed by a third party. Although Portugal is willing to do its best to maintain friendly relations with Czechoslovakia, such a contradictory and passive policy is difficult for Portugal to tolerate for the sake of national honor, so it had no choice but to take this action. (National Maritime Telegraph dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>⊙Prague, Capital of Czechoslovakia After the Portuguese government severed diplomatic relations with Czechoslovakia, the Czech government instructed its minister to Portugal to remain at his post until the Portuguese government forces him to leave. Czech officials are extremely surprised by this action of Portugal. Political figures believe that Czechoslovakia's refusal to allow arms to be exported to Portugal was due to fear of violating the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish Civil War. This statement is completely untrue, because the arms purchase negotiations began with the permission of the London Adjustment Committee, and Portugal's order of arms from Czech factories was actually introduced by the Czech government itself.

<h3>Concession Security Further Strengthened Foreign Merchants' Steamers</h3>
<p>Building a Second Line of Defense Along the Suzhou Creek Enemy Soldiers Will Not Be Able to Cross After Retreating</p>
<p>More Than One Battalion of British and American Defense Troops</p>
<p>The British and American navies, who have been arriving in Shanghai for days to defend the Public Concession, have completely landed and gone to their designated defense areas to garrison. The defense of the western and central districts of Shanghai is entirely undertaken by the British troops. In addition to Gezhi Public School on North Hai'an Road, the Nichengqiao Racecourse, and the barracks in the western district, the empty and uninhabited mansions have been occupied by these defense troops since yesterday. However, the racecourse has the largest number of people and sufficient weapons. In addition to the original troops stationed there, the First Special District Court has added the Women's Prison, the Qianjiang Public Hall on Luqianshi Road, and the corner market building at Gansu Road and Qipu Road. The total number of troops stationed there is more than one battalion. A large number of new troops have also been added to the Hua Chan Public School on Erjin Road. Therefore, many soldiers are guarding each iron gate or artillery position within the jurisdiction of the Northern District Police Station, which is sufficient to respond to emergencies. In addition, small teams of soldiers patrol the roads in the defense area all day long. The thugs in the areas they pass through have become somewhat restrained, unlike the open looting of the previous two days.</p>
<p>Three Lines of Defense in the Public Concession</p>
<p>The Public Concession authorities are still continuously carrying out the road protection work north of the Suzhou Creek. The barbed wire, sandbags, and other obstacles were initially set up at the junction with the Chinese Concession. Later, seeing the emergency situation and the Japanese army retreating into the Concession in successive waves, they set up a second set of obstacles a certain distance behind the first line of defense. Yesterday, they began to build the first line of defense. The area where the defense is being built is the south bank of the Suzhou Creek on the south side, starting from the Waibaidu Bridge municipal office, following Suzhou Road westward, until it connects with Zhongshan Road in the Chinese Concession. On the north side, it starts from the southern end of the Concession Road, turns from Erjin Road to North Zhejiang Road and Run, and follows Erjin Road eastward to the Japanese-occupied area of ​​East Hongkou. On the east side, it starts from the North Zhejiang Road Methodist Church and follows North Jiangxi Road south to the water bridge on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek. The defensive structures of each line are all wooden bridges about three feet long built along the roadside, surrounded by extremely dense barbed wire. In addition, sandbags two feet high are piled up at each intersection, with machine guns placed behind the sandbags, with the gun muzzles facing east or north. Other locations, such as the north side of Xizang Road Bridge and the intersections of North Zhejiang Road, Hai Ning Road, and Bazhi Road on North Jiangxi Road, now have small steel cannons mounted on the gun emplacements, with the gun muzzles all facing north. This arrangement is obviously a strategy to prevent Japanese bandits from fleeing into the Concession and moving west of North Sichuan Road and south of Erjin Road after their defeat. Currently, in these three lines of defense, only the North Jiangxi Road line is where the Japanese plainclothes soldiers on North Sichuan Road are facing each other. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, while the Western Patrolman and workers were stacking sandbags on that line, the enemy special agents wandering on North Sichuan Road were paying close attention.</p>
<p>Chinese Platoon Transferred to Central District</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Shanghai War, the Chinese Platoon of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has been sent to guard the Xilao Prison on Huade Road in Hongkou. The members of its translation team have been assigned to various locations in West Shanghai and East Shanghai to cooperate with foreign teams, specializing in translation work. For example, before our army recently carried out a bombing of a certain bridge on Jessfield Road in West Shanghai, the British army was notified to withdraw. At that time, the British army did not understand the situation and refused to withdraw. After the members of the platoon explained in detail, the British army agreed to move away. Various misunderstandings were eliminated. In addition, when the artillery battles between the two sides in East Shanghai were fierce, refugees fled for their lives, unable to survive. The Chinese Platoon also made every effort to rescue countless refugees to safe areas. Recently, the platoon has been ordered to garrison the most prosperous central district of the Public Concession, responsible for maintaining local order.</p>
<p>French Troops Will Arrive in Shanghai Within Days</p>
<p>Shanghai Times reports that one thousand and one hundred French reinforcements coming from Vietnam will arrive in Shanghai today or tomorrow. They plan to land immediately to replace the police force in defending the Concession border, so that the police force can concentrate on maintaining order within the Concession. The French authorities have not requested to send additional reinforcements, but it is said that there are 20,000 troops stationed in Vietnam who can depart immediately upon receiving orders. The British Concession already has armored vehicles driving slowly on busy streets after the arrival of British reinforcements. The US government has also expressed a firm attitude regarding the Shanghai crisis. One thousand two hundred US sailors will rush to Shanghai from San Diego within days, under the command of Lieutenant General Bamont. The British, French, and American authorities are so concerned about the interests of Shanghai that yesterday, Shanghai, except for the war zone, had already stabilized the people's hearts.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants' Steamers Suspend Service to Shanghai</h3>
<p>European and American Ships Will Not Come</p>
<p>The Yangtze River route originally had seven companies (transporting people's livelihood materials) with more than seventy steamers traveling back and forth between Shanghai, Hankou, Yichang, Chongqing, and other places. Since the Yangtze River was blockaded on the 14th, the Yangtze River steamers of Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire in the upper reaches can only travel between Hankou and Nanjing. Their business has slightly reduced the number of passengers, and there are no goods. Yesterday, Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson decided to implement a suspension of Yangtze River services on the Jinghan section. Starting today, the foreign merchant cargo ships of Sino-British and Sino-American lines in Shanghai have received telegram orders from their respective headquarters stating that passage through Wusongkou is very dangerous before the end of the Sino-Japanese war, and there is no business in Shanghai. Therefore, the far eastern class ships such as the Tien Hsiang, the Prince, and the Glen Line will not go to Shanghai starting from the 10th. Even if there are goods to be unloaded in Shanghai, they will be diverted to Hong Kong for unloading. The various postal ships on the European and American routes are also considering suspending service to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Refugees Flock in, Authorities Solve Food Problem</h3>
<p>Adjustment Association Plans to Set Up Public Sales Offices Bureau of Works Transports Rice and Grain Late at Night</p>
<p>Since the start of the Shanghai war, compatriots across the country have remained calm. The authorities of the two concessions in the city have implemented martial law to maintain local security, so the market is still stable. Our financial authorities have promulgated financial measures for the emergency period, and various banks and money houses have also opened. Yesterday, the largest department stores, pharmacies, and candy stores were completely closed. On the food front, the food adjustment association has completed its planning, first borrowing grain to supply for one month and finding ways to facilitate shipping, in order to supply the source steadily. Today, 39 rice sales offices have been opened on various roads, and more will be added every day thereafter. On the fuel front, raw materials have been accumulated to supply for half a year, but they are scattered in various locations and are being transported and collected. The Concession authorities are allowing the usual release of vegetables and river fresh products on the market, and the source is endless, so there is no concern about food shortages.</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association and the Soybean and Rice Industry Association held a joint meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 19th) on the sixth floor of the Pootung Mansion at the intersection of Route Edward VII and Avenue Foch to discuss the payment and lending of rice and grain that has been completed but not yet shipped by the industry, as well as their responsibilities. It was decided that August 21st would be the deadline for payment for all rice and grain, whether due or not. Those who should sell should collect payment from the buying industry for the goods, according to 80% of the weight declared in the customs declaration. If the payment is overdue, it will be treated as a cancellation of the contract. This measure is now being jointly announced to the industry by the two associations.</p>
<p>The Food Adjustment Committee has established forty-four locations since yesterday (the 19th) to handle food adjustment matters in the city during the emergency period. All locations are open for business. Each location has a sign that says "Food Adjustment Committee No. × Rice Sales Office." Citizens going to buy rice are very crowded at each location, and the police are maintaining order. Rice prices are sold according to regulations, and citizens are all happy. In order to maintain the food supply for the troops in the war zone and the disaster victims in dangerous areas, the committee has specially joined with the Soybean and Rice Industry, the Rice Merchants, the Miscellaneous Grain Industry, and other groups to add more public food sales offices. It is planned to set up twenty locations in the south of the city.</p>
<p>The Agricultural and Commercial Bureau and rice merchants in the city ordered 300,000 dan of foreign rice from overseas in order to replenish domestic food and prepare for the people's food during the emergency period. The rice has been loaded onto merchant ships in the place of origin and transported to China in multiple batches. A portion of about 100,000 bags arrived in Shanghai the night before last and was unloaded and stored. The remaining 200,000 bags have been transported directly to coastal areas for storage in order to maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Works experimented last night with transporting grain within the Concession during the night curfew hours, as this would eliminate the need to send police to guard the passage. It was very good. The Bureau has agreed with the Shanghai Volunteer Corps that if the transportation is carried out during the day, it will be guarded by the corps members, but the Chinese Concession and the eastern district cannot enter at night. Today, the Bureau is experimenting with having Japanese police officers assist in transporting the stored rice in the eastern district. The Bureau plans to transport the stored rice in the area of ​​the Xin Zha Road Bridge, which has been permitted by our local administration.</p>
<h3>Police Chief Cai Discusses Security in the City</h3>
<p>Peace and Tranquility Prevail Except Where Enemy Flames Have Spread Hope That All Citizens Will Work Together to Maintain It</p>
<p>Our frontline military victories have boosted morale, but the security of the rear is of great importance. The reporter paid a special visit to Police Chief Cai Jingjun yesterday and was told that since the Japanese army's provocation on the 13th, which triggered the War of Resistance, it has been a week. I, as the person in charge of local security, have formulated a top-secret plan for maintaining order in the rear and have urged all police personnel to work hard and diligently, without allowing any slackness. Since the outbreak of the war, the urban jurisdiction has remained as peaceful and tranquil as ever, except for the areas affected by the enemy flames. The social situation is orderly and undisturbed, so that the frontline soldiers have no worries about the rear. Patriotic people from all walks of life are able to focus on various rear work such as relief, fundraising, and rescue. This is somewhat gratifying, but it is also due to the calm, responsive, and prudent handling of our citizens. However, this war of resistance is different from the past. All of our people in the rear should inspire their spirits, innovate, and contribute their material and energy resources, and prepare for a long-term struggle. The order in the rear is of utmost importance, and I hope that all citizens will work together to maintain it. Any traitors and reactionaries, covert disruption, petty villains, and arsonists who take advantage of the fire, the Bureau's duty is to punish them. Many cases have been punished in recent days, and strict investigations will continue to be carried out and sanctioned according to the law. However, I hope that the public will report them at any time. Once verified, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Two Spies Captured in Our Position at Bazhi Bridge</h3>
<p>Attempting to Connect to Our Military Telephone Line One Young Spy About Twelve Years Old</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from this Newspaper) According to a certain military officer on the front line who spoke to this newspaper's reporter, an enemy spy was discovered in the rear position of our army north of Bazhi Bridge on the evening of the day before yesterday (the 18th). He led ten Chinese traitors, carrying seven rifles, three pistols, one light submachine gun, and military telephone equipment, wires, and other items, attempting to connect to the telephone line on our military telephone line to steal our military secrets. They were discovered by our sentries and surrounded and captured. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to a military organization. After strict interrogation by our officials, they stubbornly refused to reveal the truth. The spy immediately swallowed the order he was carrying to hide it. The spy and traitors are still being held and instructions are being requested on how to deal with them.</p>
<p>According to the military authorities, a young child spy, about twelve or thirteen years old, was captured during a fierce battle between the enemy and our army in the Jiangwan Road area the day before yesterday. The young spy is now behind our army lines and is being treated with great kindness. Our military officials have repeatedly inquired about his name and what kind of work he is responsible for, but the child has always refused to reveal the truth. Our military authorities are planning to send him back to the enemy side within a reasonable time.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Works Hard to Revive the City's Economy</h3>
<p>Orders the Central Bank of China, Communications Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China to Prepare One-Yuan Legal Tender and Subsidiary Coins</p>
<p>With the efforts and assistance of our government and people, the markets of the two concessions in the city are gradually becoming active, and the Concession authorities are also working hard to restore them. However, there is a shortage of one-yuan legal tender and subsidiary coins in the market, which has led to an increase in exchange rates, and it is difficult for stores to find change. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Central Bank of China, Communications Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China to prepare a large amount of legal tender and subsidiary coins to circulate in the market and revive the economy. It is learned that each bank has complied with the order.</p>
<h3>South Station Opened One Passenger Train Yesterday</h3>
<p>Two Trains Were Blocked</p>
<p>According to the Railway Bureau's message, three passenger trains departed on the morning of the 18th. At around 12 o'clock, bombs were dropped on the No. 31 and No. 34 foreign bridges by enemy aircraft, damaging the tracks in several places. The bridge surface was also slightly damaged. At that time, the first passenger train had already passed, but the latter two trains were blocked and were returned to Songjiang to stop. The Railway Bureau immediately repaired the tracks overnight so that the trains could pass.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Heroic Martyrdom of Lieutenant Zhang of Our Air Force</h3>
<p>Preferring Not to Be Captured, He Killed Nine Enemy Soldiers Even the Enemy Admired His Fighting Spirit</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that at around 11:00 AM on the 17th of this month, several of our air force planes flew in formation to bomb enemy positions in the Yangshupu area. As the two sides fought fiercely, one of our planes was unfortunately damaged due to mechanical failure. The tail caught fire and it was forced to land. It was discovered that the pilot of the plane that day was Lieutenant Zhang of our Air Force. At the time, he realized that there were vibrations in the machine and immediately tried to drive it further, flying towards our position. As he was about to arrive, the rear was burning fiercely and the whole machine was heating up. He was forced to lower the plane while jumping out from the sky by the saving parachute, to hoping to avoid an accident. As a result, when the plane landed on the ground, it happened to be within our army's lines. Except for the damaged parts, the rest was intact. However, the lieutenant who jumped out from the sky was blown by the wind into the Yangshupu enemy's fire line. The enemy soldiers were gambling and immediately surrounded him, planning to capture him. Unexpectedly, Zhang was unusually brave and unwilling to be taken prisoner by the enemy. He suddenly pulled out his defensive pistol and shot at the enemy soldiers. Nine enemy soldiers were immediately shot dead. The enemy soldiers initially had no intention of killing him, but at this point, they had no choice but to shoot back. Zhang bravely broke through the encirclement, but in the end, he was outnumbered and died heroically. Afterwards, the Japanese military authorities expressed their admiration for the heroic flying general and admitted that this kind of fighting spirit was not only the glory of the Chinese Air Force, but also the honor of the Japanese army to have the opportunity to fight against such a brave warrior.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Traffic Yesterday Enemy Special Agents Restored Three Lines</h3>
<p>Public Buses on Routes 1 and 9 Drive to the Bund Tram Cars on Routes 2 and Gan Road Resume Occasionally</p>
<p>The Traffic Committee of the Public Concession Bureau of Works, in view of the inconvenience to the people due to the interruption of traffic in the Concession, specially ordered the British-owned Public Omnibus Company and the Tramway Company to give priority to restoring traffic within the possible range. The Public Omnibus Company started to restore services on "Route 1," which runs from the Bund Park on Beijing Road, via Nanjing Road, to Zhaofeng Park, and "Route 9," which runs from the Bund on Nanjing Road, via Avenue Edward VII and the entire Avenue Joffre, from 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. At the same time, the trams on "Route 1," which runs from the Bund on Avenue Edward VII, via Nanjing Road, to Avenue Joffre, also started operating from 10:00 AM yesterday morning. The trolleybuses on Gan Road from Zhaofeng Garden to Avenue Joffre have also been opened. The remaining routes and trolleybuses remain temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Traitors Beheaded</h3>
<p>Mistaking a Traitor Should Also Be Noted</p>
<p>Gu Yinglin Was Beheaded Yesterday</p>
<p>The traitor Gu Yinglin, about twenty years old, from Fubin, secretly sneaked into Zhoupu Town in Pudong the day before yesterday to probe military information and wantonly disrupt the rear. He was arrested by the local police, and the evidence was seized and interrogated. He was beheaded yesterday afternoon and his head was displayed on a telegraph pole with the crime stated, much to the satisfaction of the people.</p>
<p>Three People Arrested on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road</p>
<p>The Meizhen Security Regiment Branch in West Shanghai has continuously searched and arrested three traitors, Changshu native Wang Ziweng, Jiangxi native Luo Quanyuan, and Anhui native Shi Liye, in the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road area. Traitor evidence and morphine were found on them. After interrogation by the regimental headquarters, they were confirmed to be traitors and transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for legal action.</p>
<p>Opium Addict Mistakenly Beaten to Death</p>
<p>In recent days, there have been many cases where traitors have been beaten to death by the public after poisoning tea, but there have also been cases where people have been mistakenly identified as traitors and unjustly beaten to death. For example, at 6:35 AM yesterday, a man about thirty years old was using heroin in a small alley near Shandong Road on Guangdong Road. He was mistakenly identified as a traitor by the public and was immediately beaten to death. Therefore, it is hoped that the public will carefully examine the evidence when punishing traitors to avoid mistakenly killing innocent people.</p>
<h3>Enemy Special Agents Dress Up as Comfort Teams</h3>
<p>Carrying Out Espionage Work</p>
<p>Enemy special agents are now changing their tactics. Recently, there have been Japanese and Taiwanese spies and Korean spies who are proficient in Chinese, dressed as Chinese people, accompanied by male and female traitors, carrying comfort goods, and posing as various relief organizations. They visit various wounded soldier hospitals and refugee shelters under the pretext of comfort to carry out espionage work. It is heard that various hospitals have now strengthened their precautions.</p>

<h3>Our Side Takes Over Custody of Belongings Left at the Japanese Embassy</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Japanese Embassy and consulates in Nanjing hastily compiled two so-called "property catalogs" of belongings, which mostly contain ordinary items. On the 8th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent these catalogs to the city government for safekeeping. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the City Government Police Department, and the Gendarmerie Headquarters will jointly send personnel to investigate. However, because the staff of the Japanese embassy and consulates left Nanjing in haste, they did not take inventory of the items. Therefore, this custody by our side is an international obligation and does not entail any responsibility. As for the two merchant ships, "Rakuyo Maru" and "Taisho Maru," anchored by Japan, they await the disposal of our government. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Front Lines Hope for Funds for Comfort Supplies to Purchase Military Equipment</h3>
<p>Various groups jointly organize to comfort the soldiers; all citizens enthusiastically donate, competing to be the first</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Songhu War, our front-line soldiers have loyally fought the enemy, advancing without retreat, causing the enemy to crumble at the sight. Our rear-area civilians have enthusiastically donated funds for comfort. However, most of the donated items are not practical. The Shanghai Preparatory Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief expresses gratitude for the comfort items donated by people from all walks of life and hopes that funds can be transferred to purchase military equipment, such as sacks, steel plates, iron wire, and communication equipment, to meet urgent needs and benefit military operations.</p>
<p>Special Committee of the Women's Circle</p>
<p>The Women's Committee for Comforting the Soldiers Against the Enemy has recently organized a special committee to concentrate its efforts, bringing together twenty women's groups in the city. Liu Wang Liming serves as the chairperson. The committee was established yesterday and will begin organizing wartime mutual aid associations for women in villages, neighborhoods, and streets to awaken all housewives in Shanghai to participate in various rear-area activities, with Hu Lanqi and others in charge of preparation.</p>
<p>YWCA Service</p>
<p>In light of the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Shanghai YWCA has established wartime service sections for comfort, relief, and general affairs. The comfort team visited the Central Sanatorium (now a wounded soldier hospital) and the Red Cross Hospital yesterday and the day before yesterday, amidst the sounds of artillery fire, to comfort wounded soldiers and distribute various items of clothing and food. All women who wish to assist with money or goods are welcome to send them to the YWCA on Jing'an Temple Road for distribution.</p>
<p>Children's National Salvation Association</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, representatives from the Children's National Salvation Association, led by Mou Ling, sent a large batch of Tianjin small pears to the 20th Hospital to comfort wounded soldiers. In the afternoon, the fundraising team, divided into groups A and B, went to various companies to raise funds and commissioned the Sanyou Industrial Company to make 1,000 towels and 500 sweat undershirts to comfort the wounded soldiers. They also invited children's experts to give lectures on poison prevention knowledge.</p>
<p>Residents of Tianlefang</p>
<p>All residents of Tianlefang in Xiejiao Lane on Jing'an Temple Road, recognizing that the front-line soldiers are fighting heroically, should contribute their resources and wealth to support the nation. The residents spontaneously initiated a fundraising effort. All households in the neighborhood enthusiastically agreed. Within a few short hours, they had collectively donated over 200 yuan in cash, 10 shirts, 12 boxes of biscuits, as well as towels and gauze. Among them, many male and female servants generously donated, some donating more than two yuan each, demonstrating the enthusiastic patriotism of our people, fearing to lag behind others. It is also reported that the neighborhood has decided to use all the donated cash to purchase gasoline, bread, and other items to send to the front lines to comfort the soldiers fighting the enemy.</p>
<h3>Overflowing Shelters: Authorities Set Up Catering to Send Away Refugees</h3>
<p>The first batch of refugees to be sent away is about to depart; 90,000 people fled to Shanghai from Pudong yesterday</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in this city, the Relief Committee and various charitable organizations have established refugee shelters to provide relief. It is reported that the Relief Committee has been handling the influx of refugees in recent days, reaching a total of 40,000 people. The shelters set up by the Joint Disaster Relief Association of various charitable organizations have reached more than 60 by yesterday morning, but they are still overcrowded. Therefore, in addition to trying to find more shelters, it is imperative to find ways to send refugees out of the city. The situation is described in detail below:</p>
<p>Finding Ways to Send People Away Separately</p>
<p>The Relief Committee of this city has been handling the influx of refugees in recent days, reaching a total of more than 40,000 people. All shelters are overcrowded, making it difficult to accommodate newcomers. In addition to trying to find more shelters, the committee immediately began to find ways to send people away. However, all routes along the way need care. The committee, with Pan as the chairperson, awaits discussion with the Municipal Government to send telegrams to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which will then forward the telegrams to local county governments, asking them to take care of and protect the refugees sent by this city as they pass through. The committee also directly telegraphed various county chambers of commerce and charitable organizations in Zhejiang, asking them to accommodate them at any time and send them to various places. The above telegram was sent yesterday. Once the Suzhou-Minhang passes are processed, the first batch of refugees to be sent away will depart. The Wujiang Sojourners Association in Shanghai has been accommodating fellow refugees in recent days, numbering over one hundred. More than 500 people have registered to be sent back to their hometowns. Yesterday, a batch was sent back to their hometowns. It is reported that the association has received relief donations of 100 yuan each from fellow sojourners in Shanghai, Ren Tiaoshan and Shi Shengzhi. Yesterday, Xu Qisheng, through fundraising, donated 200 yuan from Yingshuilou. Other fellow villagers also donated enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Hu Xiyuan, the general manager of the China Yapu'er Electric Appliance Factory, recognizing the large number of unemployed workers during the war, fears that they may be tempted by others due to livelihood difficulties. He has requested the Shanghai General Federation of Industry to jointly summon factory authorities to find ways to send the workers back to their hometowns or maintain their minimum living standards.</p>
<p>Rescuing Refugees from Eastern Shanghai</p>
<p>The Joint Disaster Relief Association of various charitable organizations believes that there are still many refugees in the Yangshupu area of eastern Shanghai, who are under the iron heel of the enemy army and are often stabbed or shot. The association's vice-chairman Qu Wenliu, director Huang Hanzhi, and others, recognizing this situation, specially negotiated through various means yesterday afternoon, and the enemy finally agreed to allow passage, but only empty cars were allowed to pass. The association then sent ten trucks for the first time at around 1:00 PM, each driven by a driver and accompanied by a Japanese patrolman from the Public Works Department, through the Waibaidu Bridge to places like Jiaopeng Road in Yangshupu, rescuing more than 700 refugees. After arriving, the original trucks went again and rescued about five to six hundred people, totaling more than one thousand people, many of whom had knife wounds. The association then sent them to shelters for resettlement and treatment for the injured.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because there are many refugees, the original shelters are insufficient. Many new shelters have been specially added. As of this morning, there were already more than 60, including Jingye She (at the intersection of Avenue Road and Hardoon Road), Tuming (on Daxilu Road), Qinghua (on Baker Road), Guoguang (on Avenue Road and Carter Road), Minguang (on Jiaozhou Road), Peiming (on Hart Road and Xinzha Road), Zhengfeng (on Yaozhu Jiao Road), Weifeng (on Chengdu Road and Datong Road), Shuzhuan (on Yaozhu Jiao Road), Faculty of Law (on Dapu Bridge), Gong Wutai (on Avenue Edward VII), Qingru Elementary School (on Mintiniyin Road and Huasheng Road), Yufosi Temple (on Chengdu Road), Kunfan Girls' Middle School (on Mayburg Road and Greenbird Road), He'an Elementary School (on Chengdu Road), Weiyu Elementary School (on Ladulu Road), Tax Building (on Kang Nao Tuo Road), Zhongyang Xinguang (on Six Ma Road), Guotai (on Yu Qiaxiang Road), Shengli, Jincheng, Nanyang, and Weiyu (on Bei Dong Road). The Jingye She is exclusively for female refugees.</p>
<p>Pudong Refugees Flee to Shanghai</p>
<p>Heavy artillery battles have been raging in the Gaoqiao area of Pudong for days, destroying many buildings. People have been flocking to Shanghai. Yesterday, between eighty and ninety thousand people fled to Shanghai by ferry from Pudong. The Shanghai Relief Committee and the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, among others, dispatched vehicles to transport them to various shelters for food and supplies.</p>
<h3>Escaped Danger for Dogs from Yiyuan Dog Racing Track</h3>
<p>Twenty Dogs Missing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Yiyuan Dog Racing Track has over 300 well-trained dogs housed at several dog farms in the Yangshupu district. On Sunday, 30 to 40 staff members of the company, along with three cargo trucks, ventured through the artillery fire to transport them into the French Concession, experiencing many dangers along the way. When the trucks were passing the bridge on Feilun Road and Broadway Road, a shell landed on the seat next to the driver of the leading truck, killing the Chinese driver instantly. The truck then lost control and crashed into a store on the sidewalk. Another truck was then found to carry the dogs from the damaged truck back. However, several dogs had gone missing. A total of 325 dogs were rescued this time, with about 20 missing, dead, or injured.</p>
<h3>Bill Exchange Method During Emergency Period</h3>
<p>Entrust Bills to Force Exchange; Not Responsible if Not Received</p>
<p>The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and Jincheng Bank, etc., have already moved to safe locations. However, the bill exchange is relatively far away, and the monthly exchange does not have a fixed time. Most businesses have also moved. All kinds of bills entrusted for collection by Lianhang and the business firms of various ports, as well as the customers of this port, will be exchanged and collected as much as possible. If, due to time constraints, the businesses that cannot be exchanged or paid have already moved, or are close to the war zone, resulting in the bills not being received, the banks will not be responsible. If the entrusted bills have been exchanged by the exchange, but returned and not received, and the address of the original consignor is close to the war zone, causing the banks to be unable to notify and return the bills, the original bills will only be temporarily stored. After the war is slightly settled, the banks will collect them again. During this emergency period, the banks are not responsible for any incidents caused by bills entrusted to the bank but not received, regardless of the sender.</p>
<h3>Concession Telephones Are Easier to Connect Now</h3>
<p>Foreign Ladies Go to Hong Kong; Fewer Phone Problems in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to foreigners, since a large number of foreign women and children have left Shanghai, telephones in the concession are easier to connect than in previous days. This is probably because foreign ladies at home have nothing to do and often use the telephone to inquire about their friends. Now, these foreign ladies who like to make phone calls have gone to Hong Kong and other places.</p>
<h3>Notice to Girl's Family</h3>
<p>On the 13th of this month, at 10:10 PM, a thirteen-year-old girl was found crying on the corner of Yu Qiaxiang Road and Xiamen Road, searching for her mother. According to her statement, she was fleeing from Shanshan Road and was separated from her mother on the spot. She was taken by police officer No. 2087 of the Zilaihuo Bank to the bank temporarily. If anyone has lost this girl, they can inquire with the police officer.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's meteorological forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong, the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the East China Sea, and Taiwan are cloudy and clear, with southeastern seasonal winds. The Pacific hurricane will continue to move northwest-west. The hurricane center was located within about 120 miles of 15 degrees north latitude and 139 degrees east longitude at 6:00 AM. The wind force is unknown. In the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 92.3 degrees and the lowest was 75.6 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 96.3 degrees and the lowest was 77.0 degrees.</p>
<h3>Front-Line Soldiers Urgently Need Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>Please Donate Enthusiastically</p>
<p>Currently, the front-line soldiers urgently need sacks, canvas bags, barbed wire, cars, bicycles, telephones, flashlights, lanterns, rice, pickles, rubber shoes, raincoats, blankets, yarn blankets, as well as towels, soap, toothbrushes, and other daily necessities. Wounded soldier hospitals also lack toothbrushes, soap, towels, and other daily necessities, regardless of whether they are new or old. Please donate enthusiastically so that they can be forwarded to the front lines.</p>
