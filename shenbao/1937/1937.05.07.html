<p>［倫敦］此間刻正佈置、以便中國孔特使與英財相張伯倫•外相艾登•舉行談話、衆料此種談話、擬以具體條欵、處理兩國關係事件、惟在英王加冕以前、未必卽能舉行、因須有充分之準備也、星期二晚、孔特使於駐英大使郭泰祺設筵招待時、曾卽席與張伯倫艾登互談種種事件、歷時頗久、倫敦人士對於中國復興計畫、顯有良好印象、咸料此項計畫、定可開啟實業與經濟大發展之可能性、緣中國在政治上與經濟上近已有蓬興氣象也、泰皓士報今日以顯著地位、登載本年一二兩月中國貿易統計地位轉佳及中國鐵路收入已有起色之新聞、（中央社六日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］中英銀公司今日舉行年會、主席白那德聲稱、一九三六年乃大戰以後在華工商業所可視為最有希望亦最有益之一年、中國政治家商家與銀行家、皆以甚可稱讚之努力、與可底於成之計畫、從事於整頓一切工作、如舊欠債欵之美滿清償、卽可大可注意之三點、此事影響、已使中國信用恢復、可以適當條件舉值矣、白那德對於中中鐵道部長以精幹方法、管理鐵路及親自考核鐵路財政狀況等事、頗多揄揚之詞、概言及今後在華金融事業、謂有困難三點、（一）財政部對於外債之禁阻、（二）華盛頓條約之義務、（三）銀行團協定書之義務、顧上述困難、未有不可以忍耐的談判戰勝之者云、白那德最後使人注意於近來趨向中日接近之運動、謂汎言之、事業界與金融界對於中國前途、現漸信任之（中央社六日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於英日兩國當局進行談話事、外務部次官克藺波勛爵頃在下議院宣稱、“關於雙方在中國所保有之利益、英日兩國並未進行正式談判、最近數月以來、吾人與日本大使吉田茂進行非正式談話數次、係就英日兩國促進一般關係事、有所商談、截至目下為止、關於在華利益、或他項問題、雙方均未提出具體建議、並曾將談話情形、通告各關係國政府”、自由黨議員曼德、當詢以“此項非正式談話、有無變成正式談判之可能、”克蘭波勛爵答稱、“倘有此需要、自屬可能、”旋又答復工黨議員凱利質問云、“英國對于尊重中國主權之一貫政策、并無變更之意”云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日外相佐藤談無獨佔華北野心</h3>
<p>希望逐步解決各項懸案　互惠平等目前惜無機會</p>
<p>［東京］日外相佐藤尚武今日接見外國新聞記者、對中日關係•華北間題•中日經濟提携•以中國為中心之日英關係問題•及其他關於日本對蘇聯英美德外交問題等、有廣泛而率直之討論、佐藤並以書面談詁一件交新聞記者發表、內容略謂、“自去歲南京談判舉行後、中日關係無新發展”直至最近、兩國受共同情緒之鼓動、始有覓求改善現局之表示、而由於兩國人民之接觸較為頻繁、已開相互更形諒解之途、余信不久以前、兒玉謙次所率領赴華經濟考察團、在此方面已大有成就、余認否人應緊握每個機會、促成良好友善之空氣、而使中日提携與合作、成為事實云中央社記者乃向佐藤外相詢問、謂一月前外相在議會中所稱、以平等互惠為根據、與中國進行談判一節、是否在最近之將來、有成為事實之機會、佐藤當以極端悲觀之口脗答曰、“余本人將設法覓求種種類此之機會、惟恐目前無機可乘耳”、佐藤嗣述及華北問題、謂“日本並未抱有在華北樹立特殊與獨佔的勢力範圍之意、但立時解決華北政治問題、殊感棘手”、佐藤繼謂、“目前比較重要者、厥為解決若干次要懸案、以改善相互之情感、至獲得若干成就後、再逐漸研究是否巳屆處置較大問題之時、兩國邦交現已陷入不快之狀態、為相互利益計、實不應如是也、惟兩國陷於此種關係、為時已久、吾人務必極審愼設法掃除障碍”、记者旋問、“此種障碍果為何物、所謂次要問題意指何而言、佐藤答謂、目前以不談此問題為愈、記者又問、關於對華經濟提携、日本究有何意、此為中國人民所極欲知之者、佐藤答曰、貴國人民未充分瞭解日本之意旨、誠屬當然、蓋吾人固從未提出具體計劃也、吾人現所欲為者、乃在謀與貴國朝野領袖交換意見、</p>
<p>關於倫敦談判、佐藤承認日本曾於數月前向英政府提出建議、但謂關於日英一般關係之談話、未涉及任何實在問題、且係屬於初步性質、尚未獲得結論、故目前如認為有類似協定之事、尚屬過早，關於日蘇關係、佐藤則較為樂觀、謂目前固未曾討論不侵犯條約問題、惟倘以忍耐與決心處之、日蘇關係之改善、則屬可能、並謂日德防共協定、並非改善日蘇關係之障碍、</p>
<p>又有以日美締結不侵犯條約之傳說叩諸佐藤、據其暗示、此項計劃係出諸偶然、渠尚無向美提出建議之確切觀念、並謂此種意見、渠深感興趣、最後佐藤含笑率直而言曰、余旣為區區一外相、誠不知能留職至何時也、（六日中央社電）</p>
<p>［東京］外相佐藤今日向外國新聞記者五十人、詳述日本與各國之外交關係、謂英日間之友誼為支撐世界和平巨棟之一、並述及日本與中蘇德美之關係、佐藤自就外相職以來、此為其第一次接見外報訪員、佐藤之言曰最近日本四週之國際局勢、巳有逐漸進步之徵象、就余本身而言、刻正竭力以謀吾人對外關係中許多叢脞問題之解決、藉以增進世界之和平、余信、自基隆案和平了結及水遠租地問題解決後、英日兩國間之關係、巳見好轉、再秩父宮赴英參加加冕盛典、亦於增進兩國和諧情緒、大有裨補、而非他事所能及余希望此種良機、可使英日間傳統之友誼、因以鞏固、而成為支撐世界和平巨棟之一、</p>
<p>佐藤又稱、吾人與德國所締結之防共協定、當然基於日德兩國之親善友誼、雖海外若干方面對此、似不無誤會、尢以蘇聯為甚、然此協定之主旨、純為共同防禦、以抵制共產國際之危險破壞的活動、此則兩國政府在締結此協定時巳明白宣佈之矣、吾人之政策、一方面在增進對德之和好關係、一方面在鞏固吾人對其他各國之友誼、</p>
<p>佐藤繼言及日美關係、謂日美兩國、在政治上或其他事件上、並無何種煩惱問題、美日友誼、為兩國間良好經濟與商業關係所密切維繫者、自必逐年愈增發達、</p>
<p>佐藤復言及對於其他諸國之商業與經濟關係、謂對荷屬東印度及對印度之協定、近已成立、而對南非聯邦埃及等之談判、刻正在進行中、</p>
<p>佐藤末言及世界經濟會議問題、謂們甚希望由此會議而儘速產生恢復貿易自由之機會、否人在此數年中、無時不主張貿易自由也、（中央社六日路透社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日蘇邦交與日偽軍情</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>日蘇兩國關係的根本轉變。其關鍵不消說是全在日本方面。兩個月前日本政界有過“日蘇兩國。至少十年以內。不應發生戰爭”的論調。五個月前。則有過日蘇漁業條約延長一年的事實。兩國的關係似乎可以漸漸和緩下去。然而日本所要求於蘇聯的幾項。如㊀設立邊境委員會解决邊境問題。㊁撤除遠東軍備。消解所謂“滿洲國”威脅問題。㊂停止赤化宣傳。安定所謂遠東安全問題。至今都毫無眉目。這在急於樹功的日本少壯軍人看來。郤是不能忍耐的。現在兩國所以能暫時相安。大約有兩種原因。一則日本外交家鑒於國際環境的孤立。不得不稍稍改弦易轍。二則今日的蘇聯因經濟建設的猛進。遠東“瑪其諾”防綫的完固海軍空軍的積極擴充實力已非常雄厚。日本方面不得不有所顧忌了。</p>
<p>蘇聯駐日大使優烈尼夫由蘇返日以後。與日外相佐藤就兩國關係的改善問題。有過數度的會談。蘇聯方面最所關心者當然是日德同盟這一問題。優烈尼夫初到日本。卽坦白承認蘇聯抱反對態度。日本方面所希冀者。則是解决懸案所議懸案。本是日本軍事行動的後果。如果日本不改變以往政策不放棄它的野心。這些懸案就不會有圓滿的結果。是可斷言的。日蘇關係。在不卽不離狀態中。大約還要維持若干時日吧。</p>
<p>然而從壞的方面來推測。兩國關係也許很有可能就要惡化到極點。日本最近內政的不安。難保不會引起一個對外的波瀾來轉移國內人民的視線。面以此為維持政權的手段。因此我們不能不密切注意。近日察北偽軍的蠢動。　　　月末　承德的會議。以及謠傳中多倫•承德•錦州•卜魁•滿洲里•同江•綏芬等地日偽重軍的配置。這些軍事活動。假使不是含有日本軍人與外交家分道揚鏕。另起爐灶的意味在內。那就該有移轉視線的作用了。無論如何。這些活動的發展是對于遠東和平的極大威脅。在日蘇關係及中日關係上都說不定會釀成急劇的轉變的。</p>

<h3>基督敎協進會年會蔣夫人演辭</h3>
<p>願新生活運動與　敎會合作而推進</p>
<p>中華全國基督敎協進會第十一屆年會、昨晨假新亞酒樓舉行首次會議、出席代表百餘人、主席會長吳貽芳博士、副主席劉湛思博士、當由該會總幹事陳文淵致詞、題為“時代轉變與基督敎運動、”下午分四組討論、第一組議題為“時代轉變中基督敎的生命、”第二組為“基督敎的事工”、第三組為“合作”、第四組為“基督敎的關係、”其中談及新生活運動、至五時散會、晚敦請新生活運動婦女指導會會長蔣宋美齡女士演講、其演辭由該會會長及新生活運動促進會婦女組指導長吳貽芳博士、當衆宣讀、原詞如下、</p>
<p>社會所希望於敎會者、求其能解决當前切迫之問題、社會空氣若充塞污濁之毒氛、則堅强之宗敎信仰、不獨如防毒面具保護信徒、免受毒氛之侵襲、且將如天外清風、吹散濁氛、澄清天宇、以供羣衆之安居、我人今日來此集會、卽將討論敎會與中國今日之環境、應有若何之關係、使我人警惕此後之敎會、不應再隔離近代中國之發展而獨立、中國全國、今皆在邁進途程中、敎會自應伴隨之而同進、咸知奮身襲擊、根深蒂固、社會之惡習、為新時代闢光芒之前路、旭日初昇之中國新生活運動、正響動其嘹亮之角聲矣、</p>
<p>一•前進與忍耐之呼召</p>
<p>指摘新生活運動者、每言“羣衆當前迫切之問題為生活、而新生活運動、對此實未努力、”予將此評語、貢獻於諸君之前、與諸君共負其責任、曾憶一九三三年夏、予被邀參加在牯嶺舉行之討論會、研究基督敎與共產主義、當時予會發現基督徒之討論生活問題焉、純取學者之態度、因即深感我人實行信仰之時、確有進而作實際上工作之必要、此後全國基督敎協進會、卽與政府合作、在江西組織農村試騐區十一處、使敎會學校與其他學校中之青年男女、領導研究一般農民最迫切之問題、敎會能與我等合作、經營復興收復匯區內之工作、是委員長與予所深感不忘者也、更願此為大規模增進民衆生活運動之起點、他日發揚光大、更見斐然之成績、</p>
<p>敎會今日之所以遲遲參加農村復興運動、其主要理由、或因此種工作之艱苦、我人處此境遇、應坦白自承、基督戰士耐苦耐勞之美德、尚非我人所素習、故特殊暴露我柔弱無能之缺憾、王如先知所言、“我在𨛅城安適、”予伴予夫週歷各省、每遇虔誠敎徒、深居邊僻鄕區、與之接觸者咸受新生命之感化、當時予卽深怪我中國男女同胞、不乏才識過人、備受近代敎育者、然赴彼邊區、進行同樣工作者、固未見其人、卽伴同彼男毅敎徒、從旁協助者、亦不可得、豈受近代訓練之中國基督徒天賦之不如人耶、抑我人祇知接受信敎之利益、不願擔負此艱苦之責任耶、當知在我人信仰之核心、卽為艱苦忍耐與磨折之象徵、是卽十字架、茍缺此美德、尚何基督敎信仰之可言、嘗聞委員長言、基督以一青年、乃願為正道而犧牲其生命、我人茍不能追隨而模擬之、又安得解决當前一切重大問題、此委員長之所以信仰基督敎為一革命之宗敎、而今日之有宗敎信仰者皆當為革命家也、</p>
<p>予言倘正確、而為諸君所樂聞、則今日集會應研究我人應否準備為耶穌基督苦鬥之戰士、捨棄遼遠後方無聊之工作、奮身投入大戰塲當衝之血戰、富今日困苦之時代中、人力與國力、皆受極度磨折之測騐、則堅强之基督精神、實告誡我人應具百折不撓之毅力、時代之轉變、當視我人能以若干信仰、若干人格、若干熱誠、貫注於其間、為其推動之比例、我視藥力之大小以測騐藥性之良虞、我人亦當以我信仰、在我本身及社會所發生之影響、以測騐我信仰之眞偽、我人今日當堅定感聞上帝呼召之角聲、應卽立下决心、難犧牲生命之不辭、逞論生活之舒適、</p>
<p>知與行不可分、我人實受將信仰變成行動之使命、中國今日實如沉眠初醒者、睜目四矚、該怪其環境進步之易態、在此新環境中敎會若能忍艱苦以前進、必可佔重要之位置、</p>
<p>二•新生活運動為緊密合作之呼召</p>
<p>基督敎之信仰、非祇為社會之信條、實為上帝之顯示所謂顯示者、必有其顯示之本質、就今日言之、上帝之欲顯示於我人者、為社會之需求、為我人對社會應作如何活動之貢獻、願東方後進之敎會、與西方先進之敎會、通力合作、為各城市各村鎮之居民、締造其新生活之基礎、樹木應季候之呼召而結果實、田地應季候之呼召而結榖穗、新中國亦將應西方敎會季候合作之呼召而作光明之貢獻、予願掬予夫婦之熱忱邀請西方敎會參加新生活運動中作更緊密之合作、</p>
<p>就目前言敎會與政府之合作、江西之成績、足為模範、在基督敎協進會幹事張福良領導之下、黎川以及其他十處試騐區、皆已先後組織成立、其他十處、歸實業部主辦、黎川則具獨立性、然客之往黎川者、皆言其成績與其他十處無稍異、實則黎川與其他十處、皆一本基督敎服務精神在同一領導下、作復興之努力、又安得有差異可尋哉、更可注意者、我人於黎川及其他十處、作復興農民生活之工作時、實具有基督敎特殊之精神、蓋我人目的、在發現有效之方案、俾為民衆圖福利之士、得所採用而遵循、敎會方面、更表不其熱誠、願借人才參加、此復興農村之鉅大工作、蓋其範圍之廣闊、我人今日之努力、實不啻滄海之一粟、戰後之江西農村凋敞極矣、若能賦予再生之生命、是眞天國之降臨矣、此外足以表徽敎會與政府之合作者、厥為全國衛生事業、中國最先成立之衛生組合、為衛生敎育協進會、卽在基督敎管理之下進行其工作者有年、令此組合之工作、雖已大部分為政府所接管、然國家衛生計劃中、敎會與敎會醫院、可以作貢獻者甚多、聞基督青數協進會有醫藥幹事一人、專任推進此項合作之工作、是固我人所欣慰無量者也、衛生署今春準備牛痘苗藥管四千打、專備鄕村施針之用、請其醫藥顧問牧思波師母、要求新生活運動會之協助、卽由牧思波師母與數省新生活運動商妥、取得各當地敎會醫院學校，及鄉間禮拜堂之合作、推進四村種痘運動、目前衛生當局、在邊僻區內、尚未能完備其衛衛生事業之機構、則敎會補助其不足、亦為民服務之一良好機緣也、目前痘苗已經領法四分之一、分配各處施用、經衛生局新生活運動會及醫院學校與禮拜堂之合作、人民之種痘苗者已有六萬餘人、</p>
<p>廣州近成立一婦女祈禱會、會員已達一千人、每一會員、皆每日偕其家屬、為中國及其領袖作祈禱、此為表現愛國思想之一種特殊方式、其效果足以養成精神上堅强之團結、新生活運動、期望全國各禮拜堂、皆有此種祈禱之組織、</p>
<p>鐵道部長張嘉嗷、今特製火車一節、名為“輪上新生活”、開赴各綫停留大小城市、推進新生活運動、車中備有電影設備、以及其他視覺敎育用品、俾在各處街衙、禮堂或教堂中隨地可以應用、願諸君主持之各敎堂、當此車開到時、與之合作、欲知詳細辦法、可亟詢南京新生活運動總會、</p>
<p>凡此合作實不需高深之敎義、與聖潔之靈感、卽以中國本有之舊道德、犧牲自我博愛人羣而言、亦當踴躍參加矣、人稱基督敎為物質文明之代表、此固確切之論斷、蓋近代生活之持久與幸福、皆持各種科學之發明、而基督敎國家、為各種發明之策源地、原始之物理學、希臘等國、雖有相當之貢獻、然發揚而光大之、而成人類共同之享受者、實基督敎國家獨有之功績、近代生活之輸入今日中國焉甚速、而中國人民之接受此生活焉、亦來者不拒、使徒保羅賦予人類物質生活以莊嚴之含義而言曰、“汝不知汝身卽為聖靈之廟宇耶……”則幸福之物質生活、决不意為少數人所獨有、應為一般人所同享、使此“新生活”普及民間、實為我基督徒不意諉卸之責任、</p>
<p>基督信仰到達之處、婦女地位為隨之而增高、不久以前、內地各敎會學校、勸導婦女入學、接受近代敎育、皆為免費、甚至給獎以鼓勵之、其苦心孤詣、實足感人、今此等受訓練之婦女、皆以參加各項運動、在各省提高其姊妹之生活狀况與地位、其信仰之形成、已具體化而見諸行動矣、願新生活運動與敎會、在此方面、亦發揮其合作之精神、求全國各村各鎮婦女與兒童生活之改進、深知世界敎會財政豐裕、又多熱誠幹練之青年、願集此財力人力、同赴此時代迫切之需要、</p>
<p>江西主席熊式輝、今正推進大規模增進全省婦女兒童生活之運動、由朱夫人（熊秉二先生女公子）之指導、此項運動之活動、能以敎會與省內社會運動各組織之合作為主榦、當熊主席去年在北平時、曾請燕京大學女敎授若干人、代為擬訂推進此項運動之計劃、卽彼今所稱之“三重合作計劃是也、所謂三重者、㊀與受高等教育之婦女合作、㊁與今已在江西活動之敎會、及社會運動各組織合作、㊂與新生活運動會婦女委員會合作、則熊氏於此增進婦女地位為國家服務之奮鬥過程中、期望於敎會之協助者固甚鉅也、</p>
<p>世之論者、每有以為與政府合作、鮮有成效可言、卽我國人持世意見者甚多、南昌有某敎會重要社會服務者、因其長時期與該省婦女新生活運動會作合作之活動、卽受某同事嚴厲之非難、然我人當知、審慮周詳後之合作與服務、得益者必遍及各方、敎會參加此項運動後、所得之實益、則為社會智識與繁榮之增進、蓋凡智識與繁榮增進之社會、敎會與禮拜堂、自成其不可或缺之機構、</p>
<p>我人前因江西收復匪區中、急需受大學敎育之婦女人才、留彼服務、請金陵女子文理學院推薦人選、該院院長吳貽芳博士、（基督敎協進會會長、亦即今日宣讀本文者、）商同該院敎職員、卽於畢業生中、選送勤奮公正者數人前往、今其服務之成績、已為彼間衆口所讚許、今日吾人已可告語曰、“倘金陵推選畢業生往農村服務不必深究、卽請立刻派送可矣”、凡由基督敎主持之學校、大半對於推進學生新生活運動、皆有重大之貢獻、而其管理經費之節省、工作成績之優良、在國難環境中奮鬥之經過、皆在全國留不易隱滅之鮮明印象、願在教育中、勿以自滿而生怠心、勿以事半而中止、蓋委員長與予、皆以合理之生活、必有宗敎之信仰、無宗敎、敎育未同備國家、今日各種事業　皆亟待領袖之人才、當亟待有基督敎　服務精神、與身體力行之人才、</p>
<p>男女青年會實在領袖人才之前綫、我人受其經年累月之潛移默化、深感有改變生活方式之需要、使靑年對新生活熱情之向往者、男女青年會之協助實多、</p>
<p>我人當知基督對於人格之重視、非止於興趣之境界、彼熱切關懷社會之福利、不能忘懷於天國之降臨、蓋所謂天國者、一切人之正義與公道寄托處也、中國人民素重人格其禮貌周旋、注意“顏面”、每為外邦人士所詬病、其生活大半為習尚所束縛、為維持身體所支配苟可避免、絕不願損害他人、我人所視為理想之社會、責尚“中庸”拾極端而取其中、因此、集體主義之國家、實非中國人民所欣羨、蓋其絕滅個人以充實其國家、蹂躪人格以建樹權威、皆非為國人所喜也、</p>
<p>新生活運動、堅决排斥一切組織之形式、蓋以其與先總理之遺敎背馳、且為陰懷異志、不顧人權而蹈隙思逆者、造壓迫人民之機會、中國人民自有其思想、並永續其思想之活動、必能瞭解其文化、其正義、感其愛好、自由之天性者、始能得中國人民之合作、中國社會中自有其新生活之眞諦、其所需要者、惟導引力與宗敎信仰耳、新中國之基礎　實為其祖先之經營、决非近代各種主義之所能代謀、</p>
<p>三•新生活運動為協助國家復興之呼召</p>
<p>世界事件之推進、每易令人失望之感、然基督敎之信仰、永遠予我人以國家復興之希望、基督敎之精神、旣非純粹神學之系統智識、更非一般所稱之哲學、實兼二者而廣之、包括人與人間個人信仰之關係、我人今日之職責、應搜尋我人信仰與一般生活之接觸點、時代之需要、實為我視綫之指針、</p>
<p>有史以來、上帝恒以默示與人類通靈感、由其聖靈之仲介、與我人作精神上之唔對、彼啟口時、我人卽能感知、理智與感情可同時受其響應、我人一旦發現復興之需要、復發現完成壯復興之工具、則大勢之趨、如潮汐之汹湧、我人為之挾持而去、無可抗拒、惟其進行中我人應負工作之內容、自可逐漸瞭解而達豁然貫通之境界、</p>
<p>基督有二特點、彼之生活、即以共敎言為準、彼之信仰、有移山之力、我人締造新社會、前途之艱鉅、實需要此二種特性之協助、新生活運動、要求我人實行人類之最高理想、堅持信仰而邁進、個人與社會皆需要積極之動作、此固基督敎精神所固有者也、</p>
<p>閱今日節目中、有“敎會與其關係”一項、在此項下、復列有新生活運動之子目、故略述感想、以為此項問題中、予個人之貢獻、</p>
<p>關於前述國家復興一節、尚有數語補充、中國人民生活之改變、必按照先總理所規定之步驟推進、蓋中華民國之首創者、實為一信仰與行動俱備之完人、彼靈魂中燃熾救生民於水火之熱情、彼與我主實殊途同歸、無可非議、生於信仰、死於信仰、今則留此完成革命最重要之階段、以待我人之努力、建設之最重要者、厥為人民精神生活再生、與其性質之增進、人民之社會生活、自有其歷史締造之過程、决非我人所能創造、惟改善之、貫注之以新靈魂實為我人力之所能及、基督徒生活之發創、實則“在其精神上作劇進永久之改變”、卽一般所謂新生是也、“改變其繼長之主義、變易其習慣與生活之狀態、以聖靈之指導、繼續其生活之新型”、此即新生活之內形、亦卽國家復興之起點也、廣義言之、此部份之建設、實為敎會應負擔之工作、願新生活運動與敎會合作推進之、</p>

<h3>綁匪擄架曹啟明未遂華捕韓俊才殉職</h3>
<p>唐家灣斷絕交通搜捕綁匪無着　綁匪沿途開槍四人中流彈受傷</p>
<p>昨晨九時許法租界勞神父路唐家灣口發生圖綁未遂、開槍拒捕鉅案、結果一華捕因公殉職、當塲斃命、流彈並擊傷男女三人、匪共四名、均於紛亂中兔脫無踪、詳情分誌於下、</p>
<p>事主家世</p>
<p>鉅商曹啟明、本地人、現年五十八歲、前以經營航業起家、嗣在江西路五十一弄二號開設寶豐花紗號、自任總經理職、向寓法租界勞神父路第十六弄（卽賢成坊）五十八號松廬自建之大廈、滬西漕河涇道上、有一矞皇巍峨之建築、亦卽曹獨建之曹氏宗祠也、</p>
<p>綁匪四人</p>
<p>曹雖年近耳順、但頗儉約、自持、勤於職守、每晨最晚九時半必親到號辦公、昨日晨起已鐘鳴九下、略進早餐、卽偕友人步出弄口、擬登自備汽車、（租界第五九一號）車夫曹仁甫（年二十一歲、本地人、正伸手鈕開車門、曹正待俯身步入車廂之際、路旁空躍出兩御長衫兩着短裝之綁匪四人、各出手槍、將車包圍、</p>
<p>華捕馳救</p>
<p>當時汽車夫見狀、已呆若木雞、曹更面如土色、際此千鈞一髪之秋、幸有路人在後見狀、遂狂呼强盜、其時適有該段值差第六一一號華捕韓俊才聞警自西如飛趕到、瞥見曹為匪所困、正擬奮勇上前救護、詎四匪為先發制人計、一齊閃避於汽車側面、對準該捕亂槍齊發、該捕亦速擊八槍、惜無一得中、</p>
<p>因公殉職</p>
<p>該捕因毫無掩蔽致身中三槍、內一彈　適中胸部、遂不支而踣、倒仆於弄口第十四號水豐烟紙店門口、據目擊者云、該捕仆地之後尚一度掙扎作追捕狀、卒因彈中要害、旋卽斃命、亦云勇矣、但在該捕罹難殉職之一剎那、曹氏遂得乘隙返身逃入弄內、而得免一嘗肉票之風味、較之該捕蓋所謂有幸有不幸矣、</p>
<p>搜捕無着</p>
<p>匪槍亂發、行人紛紛逃避、四匪悉乘機雜人紛擾人叢中、完全兔脫、待法捕房聞警、立派大批武裝中西探捕趕到、匪已無踪、捕頭遂下令西自唐家灣小菜塲鐵柵門起、東至菜市路止、臨時斷絕交通、詳加搜索、但卒無所獲、同時毘連華界西分局亦出動大批長警協助檢查行人、亦未有發現、</p>
<p>死者忠勇</p>
<p>當時捕頭先將殉職華捕韓俊才之屍身、舁入台拉司脫路工部局醫院附設之騐屍所、候報請法院檢騐、查韓捕籍隸河北、年僅二十九歲、於民國二十年一月間開始供職迄今已屆六載、妻張氏、年二十二歲、結婚四載、生一子甫兩歲、韓捕平日忠於職守、素為當局所嘉許、故身後異常蕭條、此次竟因公殉職、捕房决優予撫恤、並聞得事主曹啟明對該捕捨身救人之精神、更表示異常感悼、亦决儘量優恤、以慰忠魂、</p>
<p>流彈傷人</p>

<h3>洋麥價昂成本抬高麵粉廠多停車減工</h3>
<p>大公社云、各地麵粉廠因國內麥產缺乏、紛紛訂購洋麥接濟、現海外洋麥亦因荒歉、致不敷市塲應用、價格報漲、成本抬高業已停止訂購、各廠原料困難、相繼停車減工、茲經大公社記者調查各情如次、</p>
<p>洋麥昂貴</p>
<p>國外如坎拿大•支加哥•澳洲•等處、為世界著名產麥區、每年產量、佔全世界百分之九十以上、惟去年因受天氣關係、麥產荒歉、收數驟然減少　求過於供、不敷市塲原料之需用、因此市價提高、與我國麥相差達十分之二三、且在市塲交易者現貨甚少、如成交訂購洋麥其交貨期限亦無固定、亦可概見海外洋麥（敷支配之一斑、</p>

<p>麥產現狀</p>
<p>本年入春以來、氣候失常、陰雨綿延、時令倏寒倏暖、故農家下種之小麥、因麥地積水成渠影響滋育、近日雖天氣轉暖、春熟受此創傷後、已入病態、將來生產量勢必歉收、江南各省情形相若、但據記者調查所得、華北如魯晋數省小麥、因氣候調勻、晴雨有度、滋長蕃殖、其產量可預卜豐收云、</p>

<p>言談</p>
<h3>拒售私貨運動</h3>
<p>— 何必</p>
<p>我國三大宗產物米茶絲到現在都是有“不堪回首”的樣子。像粵省，現在免稅進口洋米，而內地，却因糧食過剩而米價慘跌，更以水旱兵荒，農村破產，以土地為財寶之農夫竟至無以自活；茶的市塲不大清楚，不過錫蘭茶葉的推銷，國茶的市塲恐亦甚狹窄了。至於蠶絲業因為人造絲的抬頭，自然更是“一落千丈”“絲廠停秤”，“蠶農視育蠶為畏途”，這些不幸的消息已經平常得引不起人們的憂懼了。而自走私猖獗以來，國綢更呈慘象：在這岌岌可危的情況之下，我們看到了福州綢布業的聯合宣言，“聲明實行拒絕售賣私貨，以盡商人愛國天職。”</p>
<p>受走私影響的自然不止綢布業，“拒售私貨”的呼聲，各業似乎也都大聲疾呼過，不過沒有福州綢布業的正式發表宣言而已。這辦法粗看起來是很對的，各業聯合一致拒售私貨，私貨旣無銷路，走私自會絕跡；但是這種消極的辦法，至少在現在是行不通的，卽如“閩商拒售私貨運動”的通訊所云：“加入同業公會之著名綢布店，亦‘利令智昏，’悍然不受公會之裁制，皆大售人造絲貨品，且在本市售賣之外，更運往閩東閩北各縣傾銷，究其原因，實以某國出品之人造絲類綢緞，關稅較低，成本甚輕，”所以，“去年全市綢布營業額，計有六百萬元，除綢布業公會所屬各家佔二百七十萬元外，而走私貨，外商批售，與不加入公會之店號，及肩挑小販者，反有三百三十萬之多。”從這里可以看出，卽使聯合宣言發生了效力，“某國出品之人造絲類綢緞”還佔着“關稅較低成本甚輕”的便宜。關於後者，在各國都以機械來代替人工的，現在，各種貨品都是出產速而成本輕，卽如與我們報業有密切關係的報紙，在紙價暴漲的時候，我們還要等到漲至五元出關（這是今年一月里的話，現在已經到這個數目了）才能與外貨競售，那等到人家稍稍跌價的時候，我們還有“活路”嗎？至於前者，自然毋庸我們來多說了。</p>
<p>不過，在“武裝緝私，事實上不能辦到”的時候，“拒售私貨”自然不失為退而求其次的辦法，因為，“倘若走私，則成本輕而又輕，”全市六百萬元的營業額完全要被走私貨奪去，也是輕而易舉的事。另一方面對於蠶絲業如何改進，也是刻不容緩有待於專家的努力；不但此也，其他民族工業亦無獨不然。否則他們還是可以因“關稅較低，成本甚輕”的便利傾銷於中國市塲。</p>
<p>“以盡商人愛國天職”不見得以“利令智昏，公會裁制”可以收效的。</p>
<h3>棚戶往何處去</h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>上月底我們還提心吊膽地害怕本月三日强行拆除草棚，將引起“未可預料的危險”。然而，現在我們欣幸地看到“和平解决”了。當然，這所謂“和平解决”還是不如希望中那麼完滿。可是，强硬態度的稍為和緩，已是輿論一致反對的結果。不選，“和平解决”以後，棚戶將往何處去呢？</p>
<p>據報載，“和平解决”的辦法是這樣的：“工部局允許棚戶們自行拆除草棚，每戶津點十四元，限蘭路以西的四百餘棚戶們，在本月六日以前，完全自行拆除。”而那十四元津貼，還有如下的限制：“棚戶自動拆除草棚者須在六日前完全拆清，十日才可以領到十四元的津點，到八日不拆的，工部局仍要强拆，津點取消。”棚戶方面簽約者是代表殷一甫，而且是“代表先和工部局簽字然後通知棚戶。”這裏面是頗有疑問的，不過弱點終在棚戶代表，我們暫時不管他。而那“和平解决”辦法又是否好辦法呢？現在我們便來算一算這一筆賬罷。工部局之所以不接納棚戶建議，當然是為了拆棚時間問題；而拒絕華董的“捐助棚戶十萬元建築平民村”的建議呢，怕在時間以外，還有經費問題。但是如果拿津貼棚戶的費用來算，似又未盡然。棚戶共四百餘，將及五百家，每家十四元，如照四百五十家算，也有六千塊錢。而這只是第一批，以後還有其他棚戶呢，光是這筆津貼，加上“捐助”的（棚戶自儲的暫不算在內）似乎也很够建築平民村的了，只要工部局能够體諒棚戶的困難，展緩拆棚日期在二三月以後。</p>
<p>現在，讓我們再看忍痛接受“代表”給他們的恩惠的棚戶們，被迫搬遷以後的慘狀罷。下面的情形是五日報載的。“已拆除的棚戶到那裏去呢，多數是流浪着，露宿在街道弄口，一小部份又搬到蘭路以東的棚戶區內，另起草棚。”我們卽使撇開了“慘狀”不談，在辦法的本身，似乎也未見得怎樣盡善。</p>
<p>上面已經說過，每家津貼十四元，在工部局是已支出了一筆可以補助建村的費用；而在收受者的棚戶呢，却仍是一無所得。棚戶的草棚建築費“由十元至四五十元”的損失不去說，而單就棚戶目前的生活，便已發生問題。本月六日以前便要搬遷，而事隔四天以上才可以得到十四元的津貼，緩不濟急，這是第一。第二呢，從前有草棚，雖然簡陋，但住的問題總算雖已解决，而領了十四元以後，固然不能靠此筆津貼作建屋費，而以後每月便要多負擔了一筆房屋的租費，在貧窮棚戶，生活已毫無保障，倘使再强使增加負擔，事實上是不可能的事。</p>
<p>因此，在目前已發生了不良的結果，在未限令拆棚的境界“另起草棚”，這在工部局不是增添麻煩嗎？至於“露宿在街道弄口，”這更是在“整飭市容”，保持清潔衛生之外的了。</p>
<p>五日的消息，是還有二百多戶（佔全數之半）還沒有遵命遷移拆讓。到八日限期，還會否發生“未可預料的危險”，那還是不可知的。不過，卽使全部遵命和平拆讓了以後，棚戶還是無地可去的。在未到限期以前已能看到以後的結果，這總該放棄蠻幹的主張，周執的褊見，而再從新想一個更妥善的方法了吧？同時關於華董的“捐助十萬元建築平民村”的建議，也應超出建議而見諸事實的了。因為卽使工部局不答應，建屋也是合法的。否則，敎那些“為了十四元而變成流亡者”的棚戶們，往何處去呢？同時，我們且覺得受了此次敎訓以後的棚戶們，自己也應該知道往何處去的了！</p>
<h3>大渡口雜寫</h3>
<p>— 金鈴</p>
<p>（春來了。風箏繫我以遼闊的鄉思。）</p>
<p>春風抑鬱地，掠過原野，掠過樹梢。</p>
<p>像浮萍從池水里泛出了的生機的青色：這淺碧的天空從灰雲里露出了鱗爪。</p>
<p>雨後的鄉村，濘泥的田野，是一隻回了潮的嗓子所唱出的歌聲。——道路上的濘泥，把人們的脚像心一樣的粘着。</p>
<p>傷兵醫院紅色的樓房，在這沉寂而遼闊的天空里，顯示了孤獨的抑鬱底頹喪。</p>
<p>沿着唯一的石板的街道，擠滿了兩百家的民房。右板被泥漿遮沒了：過路人蹣跚的步武底踐踏，污點飛散到刷在草牆上的半黃色的石灰底身上。——一條遲鈍了流動的生活的河呀！永遠地，永遠地緩緩地拖延。抑鬰像綠霉一樣地粘上了這寗靜的夢底邊緣了——什麼時候它會暢快地流動呢？</p>
<p>鳴箏沉寂地飛上了天空，無力地在顫搖！誰也沒有把頭抬起來看牠，除了長入蟄居在陰濕的矮屋里的孩子們以外炊烟嬾嬾地掛上了烟囱：然而只是像旋風一樣地低徊；左右地旋繞着，總不會筆直地升上那鱗爪的淺碧的天空。也許牠也感到抑鬰底逼人吧！</p>
<p>田野里：像倒在牆角邊的茶葉被春雨濕成了一絲青意的麥芽，衰弱地伏在豬色的土上。是一絲微笑的皺紋刻在紫銅色的臉上；然而終究是空氣里底抑鬱太濃厚了，笑容開不出一朶花。</p>
<p>在田壠底那一角：幾棵才報青的泖樹的下面，土圍子圍了一個圓圈。那里是公共的墳地！——本來是一塊私人底墳地，後來因為縱橫地葬滿了傷兵，於是那位所有者憤慨地放棄了。於是成了公墓！</p>
<p>我的獾子妹妹就是葬在這里的。</p>
<p>在城里生長的她：不慣這里底陰鬱底蛀蝕，她無聲地在孤寂里凋謝了。然而我沒有要大的感傷，因為我感傷到那整個的抑鬰下的一切：這一條停滯的污濁的生活底河流底身上去了。</p>
<p>沿江的圩堤：歷年的人工，種下了無數的血汗。然而牠依然總是輕鬆地無力地，聽江水底打擊。</p>
<p>木樁一排排地列在圩基底邊畔，是想減輕潮水底汹涌的。然而那永遠團不起來的沙泥，一個浪頭就洗成了一個陷洞。</p>
<p>木樁也漸漸地被水吞沒了。</p>
<p>春潮正漲：圩堤也更無力地輕鬆。牠日日瘋狂地瘦削了。</p>
<p>牠是希望着狂濤底來臨麼？</p>
<p>（這里也够抑鬰了，洗洗吧！）</p>
<h3>靜子</h3>
<p>— 南</p>
<p>黑色的咖啡是帶着一點點苦澀的味的，溫婉的靜子底心呢，是比咖啡還要苦澀的啊。</p>
<p>記憶是有的，可是她再也理不清自己從什麼時候起給祖國攆到這南荒的島上來！靜子底記憶簡直就亂得和蠶絲一樣、人們都說星加坡是“赤道上的巴黎”，是金迷紙醉的黃金都會，但這和靜子有什麼關係呢，她嗅到銅臭，體味到澀味的生活，她常常在心里呌着：</p>
<p>“炎荒的島啊！沒有歡笑的地帶啊！”</p>
<p>沒有歡笑时是需要靜子珍藏起來的。她差不多整夜地得用歡笑來掩飾沒有歡笑。當夜底手掌攫到了這赤道上的巴黎，維多利亞道上車馬如龍，卡必都電影院底Neon-Light照着嘉寶和羅勃泰勃底擁抱的時候，靜子就用淡淡的胭脂塗上她底憔悴的臉頰，讓褪色的唇片抹上Tangee；聳着乳峯，走出來了。這咖啡間是有着舒適的坐位，天鵝絨底地氈，和整夜開着的Radio。從邪Radio里放送出来的有時是一個遠行的游子對於加利福尼亞底明媚的陽光的懷念，有時是紫丁香一樣憂鬰的失戀人底低吟，有時却是充滿了南海的氣息的“藍色的天堂”……給這不同的曲子引了來的是有着不同的情绪的亚美利堅水兵或大不列顛水兵。他們來自文明的西方却没有文明人底禮貌，當靜子送上他們所要的威士忌或者咖啡的時候，她常常免不了被一雙粗壯的手拖到男人底懷中：</p>
<p>“Hallo　Sweetheart”！</p>
<p>水兵是地球底流浪者，他們從這裏到那裏地變換着他們底環境。去年底五月裏在火奴魯魯喝得半醉，睜着矇朧的眼睛看了草裙舞，十月秋風起時却在菲列賓底街上迷了路，轉來轉去轉了半天才回到艦上去。現在抱了靜子在懷中嘻嘻地把她調笑着，誰知道明年的五月會在那兒呢？地球底流浪者有時可以在支那底菜館裏用筷子吃飯，有時可以在長崎底岸上吃菊子夫人手製的茶……</p>
<p>靜子是他們底Ｓweetheart，他們底天使。可是今天呌她做天使的人從明天起也許就永不來了，現代人底行踪是如此其飄忽呵。</p>
<p>而靜子底記憶也有理清的時候。有一天，她沒來由地被一個嘴上留了仁丹鬍子的酒鬼打了一記耳光，嚎哭起來了，却没有人同情她，反而聽到那酒鬼罵了她一句：</p>
<p>“亡國奴，哼！”</p>
<p>高麗，靜子底祖國是淪亡了　靜子年小的一天，被逃亡的父親帶着上了漂赴南島的船，半途父親為勞頓和宿疾所摧殘，到埠三個月以後就死去了，靜子在別人底養育之下長大，也在別人手下役使，她一直在人們底面前裝着歡笑，却過着苦澀的歲月……</p>
<p>“沒有歡笑的地帶啊！炎荒的島啊！”</p>
<p>心里雖然這樣地呌着，而人們却說這是馬來半島唯一的大都會，大不列顚帝國主要的軍港，還把它象徵做“赤道上的巴黎。”靜子就在人們底歡笑中憔悴了。</p>
<p>靜子，到那裏去呢？</p>

<h3>Sino-British Conference Imminent</h3>
<p>Special Envoy Kong Has Made Preliminary Contact with British Authorities; Britain is Willing to Actively Invest in China's Successful Reconstruction</p>
<p>[London] Preparations are currently underway here for talks between Chinese Special Envoy Kong and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden. It is generally expected that these talks will address bilateral relations in concrete terms. However, the talks may not begin until after the coronation of the King, as thorough preparation is necessary. On Tuesday evening, Special Envoy Kong had lengthy discussions with Chamberlain and Eden on various issues at a banquet hosted by Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi. Londoners have a favorable impression of China's reconstruction plan, believing it will open up possibilities for significant industrial and economic development, as China has recently shown signs of political and economic prosperity. Today, the "Times" newspaper prominently published news about the improved Chinese trade statistics for January and February of this year, and the recovery of Chinese railway revenues.

<p>[London] The Sino-British Banking Corporation held its annual meeting today. Chairman Bernard stated that 1936 was one of the most promising and beneficial years for commercial and industrial activities in China since the war. Chinese politicians, merchants, and bankers have been commendably diligent and have implemented promising plans to rectify various issues. The satisfactory repayment of old debts is a noteworthy example. This has restored China's creditworthiness, allowing it to raise funds on reasonable terms. Bernard praised the Minister of Railways of China for his capable management of the railways and his personal assessment of railway finances. Regarding future financial ventures in China, he mentioned three difficulties: (1) the Ministry of Finance's restrictions on foreign debt; (2) the obligations of the Washington Treaty; (3) the obligations of the banking consortium agreement. However, he believed that these difficulties could be overcome through patient negotiation. Bernard concluded by drawing attention to the recent movement toward Sino-Japanese rapprochement, stating that, in general, the business and financial communities are increasingly confident in China's future.

<p>[London] Regarding the talks between British and Japanese authorities, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne recently stated in the House of Commons, "Britain and Japan have not engaged in formal negotiations regarding their respective interests in China. In recent months, we have held several informal talks with Japanese Ambassador Shigeru Yoshida to discuss ways to promote general relations between Britain and Japan. To date, neither side has put forward concrete proposals regarding interests in China or other issues, and the governments of all relevant countries have been informed of the content of the talks." Liberal Party MP Mander asked, "Is there a possibility that these informal talks will become formal negotiations?" Cranborne replied, "If there is a need, it is certainly possible." He then answered a question from Labour Party MP Kelley, stating, "Britain's consistent policy of respecting China's sovereignty has not changed." (Central News Agency, Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Sato Discusses Absence of Ambition to Monopolize North China</h3>
<p>Hopes to Gradually Resolve Various Outstanding Issues; Regrets Current Lack of Opportunity for Mutual Benefit and Equality</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Naotake Sato met with foreign journalists today and engaged in extensive and candid discussions on Sino-Japanese relations, the North China issue, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, Anglo-Japanese relations with China as the center, and other issues related to Japan's diplomacy with the Soviet Union, the United States, and Germany. Sato also provided the journalists with a written statement, which read in part: "Since the Nanjing talks held last year, there has been no new development in Sino-Japanese relations." Until recently, the two countries, spurred by a shared sentiment, began to seek ways to improve the current situation. As contact between the peoples of the two countries has become more frequent, it has opened the path to greater mutual understanding. I believe that the economic mission to China led by Kenji Kodama, which concluded not long ago, has made great achievements in this regard. I believe that people should seize every opportunity to foster a good and friendly atmosphere, and to make Sino-Japanese cooperation a reality." A reporter from the Central News Agency asked Foreign Minister Sato whether the possibility of conducting negotiations with China based on equality and mutual benefit, as he had stated in the Diet a month ago, would become a reality in the near future. Sato replied in an extremely pessimistic tone, "I myself will try to find various opportunities of this kind, but I fear that there is no opportunity at present." Sato then discussed the North China issue, saying, "Japan does not harbor the intention of establishing a special and monopolistic sphere of influence in North China, but it is particularly difficult to resolve the political issues in North China immediately." Sato continued, "What is more important at present is to resolve several minor outstanding issues in order to improve mutual sentiment. After achieving some success, we can then gradually study whether the time has come to deal with larger issues. Relations between the two countries have fallen into an unpleasant state, which is not in the interests of either side. However, the two countries have been in this kind of relationship for a long time, and we must be extremely careful in finding ways to remove obstacles." The reporter then asked, "What exactly are these obstacles? What do you mean by minor issues?" Sato replied that it would be better not to discuss these issues at present. The reporter also asked what Japan's intentions were regarding economic cooperation with China, which the Chinese people were eager to know. Sato replied, "It is certainly understandable that your people do not fully understand Japan's intentions, because we have never put forward any concrete plans. What we want to do now is to seek to exchange views with leaders in all sectors of your country."</p>
<p>Regarding the London talks, Sato acknowledged that Japan had made proposals to the British government several months ago, but said that the talks on general Anglo-Japanese relations had not touched on any substantive issues and were of a preliminary nature, so no conclusions had been reached. Therefore, it would be premature to think that there was a similar agreement at present. Regarding Japanese-Soviet relations, Sato was more optimistic, saying that although the issue of a non-aggression treaty had not been discussed, improvement of Japanese-Soviet relations was possible if it was approached with patience and determination. He also said that the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany was not an obstacle to improving Japanese-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>When Sato was asked about rumors of a non-aggression treaty between Japan and the United States, he implied that this plan was a coincidence and that he had no definite idea of making a proposal to the United States. He said that he was deeply interested in this view. Finally, Sato smiled and said frankly, "As a mere Foreign Minister, I really don't know how long I can stay in office." (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Sato gave a detailed account of Japan's diplomatic relations with various countries to fifty foreign journalists today, saying that friendship between Britain and Japan was one of the pillars supporting world peace, and also discussed Japan's relations with China, the Soviet Union, Germany, and the United States. This was Sato's first meeting with foreign reporters since taking office as Foreign Minister. Sato said that recently, the international situation around Japan had gradually shown signs of progress. As for myself, I am working hard to resolve many of the complex issues in our foreign relations in order to promote world peace. I believe that after the peaceful conclusion of the Keelung incident and the settlement of the issue of water and land leases, relations between Britain and Japan have improved. Furthermore, Prince Chichibu's visit to Britain to attend the coronation ceremony has greatly contributed to enhancing harmonious sentiments between the two countries, which could not have been achieved by other means. I hope that this opportunity will enable the traditional friendship between Britain and Japan to be strengthened and become one of the pillars supporting world peace.</p>
<p>Sato also said that the Anti-Comintern Pact that we have concluded with Germany is, of course, based on the friendship between Japan and Germany. Although some quarters overseas seem to misunderstand this, especially the Soviet Union, the main purpose of this pact is purely for common defense to resist the dangerous and destructive activities of the Comintern. This has been clearly announced by the governments of both countries when concluding this pact. Our policy is to enhance friendly relations with Germany on the one hand, and to consolidate our friendship with other countries on the other.</p>
<p>Sato continued by referring to Japanese-American relations, stating that there are no troublesome issues between Japan and the United States in politics or other matters. Friendship between America and Japan is closely maintained by good economic and commercial relations between the two countries, which will certainly develop more and more each year.</p>
<p>Sato further mentioned commercial and economic relations with other countries, stating that agreements with the Dutch East Indies and with India have recently been concluded, and that negotiations with the Union of South Africa and Egypt are currently underway.</p>
<p>Sato concluded by referring to the World Economic Conference, saying that we very much hope that this conference will create an opportunity to restore free trade as soon as possible. We have consistently advocated for free trade in these past few years. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>Freight Car Carrying Rice on Yuehan Railway Derails Again in Juntian</h3>
<p>Both Locomotives Damaged; Several Injured, Including Drivers</p>
<p>[Guangzhou]</p>
<p>Freight train No. 1855, carrying rice on the Yuehan Railway, departed from Yingde Station on the 4th. After arriving at Juntian Station, it was originally intended to stop temporarily to wait for the northbound train to pass through the station. Unexpectedly, due to faulty parts and the inclined curved track, the driver was unable to stop the train, causing it to run straight to the No. 1338 pile position outside the rail point of the southbound track at Juntian Station and collide directly with an empty northbound train. As a result, both locomotives were damaged, and three southbound rice cars and two northbound empty cars were also derailed, damaging two steel rails and more than twenty sleepers. Several employees were slightly injured. After the accident, the Transportation Section Chief and the Works Section Chief immediately organized a rescue train after receiving the report and personally led employees and doctors to the scene of the accident to provide intensive care.

<h3>Executive Yuan Announces Food Regulation Measures</h3>
<p>To be Implemented from August 1; Rice Merchants in Guangdong Petition the Provincial Government</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan previously ordered the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to formulate six food regulation measures in order to regulate food in various provinces across the country. These measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for revision and approval and will be implemented from August 1 of this year. The previous Provisional Measures for Food Regulation will be abolished on the same day. The Executive Yuan recently announced the original text as follows: (1) Food should be allowed to circulate freely within the country. Local governments may not prohibit or restrict the entry or exit of food unless there are special circumstances that have been approved by the Executive Yuan. (2) The Ministry of Finance should order the Customs Administration to submit a list of the types and quantities of food imported and exported to the Ministry of Industry once a month.

The Construction Departments of each province and the Social Affairs Bureaus of each city (cities affiliated with the Executive Yuan) should investigate food production, consumption, transportation, sales, and storage conditions, and submit them to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance once a month. (3) If the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance deem it necessary to prohibit the export of a certain type of food, they should immediately submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval. If the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance deem it necessary to transport food to areas with insufficient food, they should designate the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau or the Food Transportation and Sales Bureau to coordinate with local officials to transport food for regulation from harvest areas. If the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance deem it necessary to transport foreign rice and wheat with tax exemptions or tax reductions due to a domestic food shortage for regulation, they should submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval and assign the Ministry of Industry's Agricultural and Commercial Bureau or the Ministry of Finance's Food Transportation and Sales Bureau to purchase and transport it, and merchants should not be allowed to purchase and transport it freely to prevent abuses. (4) The local food transported by the Ministry of Industry's Agricultural and Commercial Bureau or the Ministry of Finance's Food Transportation and Sales Bureau may be discussed with the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways to reduce railway and shipping costs, and priority should be given to transportation. (5) In provinces with higher rice and wheat production, the Ministry of Industry should cooperate with local governments to conduct rice and wheat inspections to standardize their quality, and at the same time, supervise and assist local governments in improving food processing equipment. (6) These measures will be implemented from August 1, 1937. The Provisional Measures for Food Regulation, which were issued in November 1936, will be abolished on the same day.

<h3>Sichuan Relief Association Hosts Gathering in Nanking Yesterday</h3>
<p>Submitting Recommendations to the Sichuan Provincial Government: Emphasis on Reducing Troops and Managing Arms Industry</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Sichuan Relief Association hosted representatives from the press, various ministries, and departments on the 6th, reporting on the disaster situation in Sichuan. Subsequently, they discussed carrying out disaster relief and contributing to the Sichuan Provincial Government on reducing troops, managing the arms industry, restricting opium planting, reducing taxes and salaries, and organizing a Sichuan Disaster Relief Committee. There was also discussion on the issuance of 12 million yuan in Sichuan disaster relief bonds and hopes that Liu Xiang would reform Sichuan politics. According to Chen Changheng's report, Sichuan's local budget has never complied with the central government's orders and has not been audited by the central government according to law. Therefore, Sichuan's past annual budget has even reached 80 million yuan, of which 50 million yuan was used for military expenses, an unbearable burden for the people. The chaos and large number of troops in Sichuan, currently estimated at 500,000, is even greater than Japan's standing army and urgently needs to be reorganized in accordance with the central government's intentions to save the disaster-stricken people. (6th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Nanking Sichuan Disaster Relief Association, noting that the drought-stricken area in the province covers more than 130 counties and the number of victims exceeds 35 million, held a tea party at the Nanjing Encouragement Society at 10 a.m. on the 6th to host people from all walks of life. The attendees included the association's president and vice-presidents Zhang Qun, Lu Chao, Xu Kan, and Zou Lin, as well as representatives from various institutions, including Chen Changheng and Qiu Jia, along with about 90 members of the Nanking press. Chairman Zhang Qun gave a report, stating that the disaster in Sichuan is severe, and the 2 million yuan in emergency funds allocated by the central and Sichuan governments is insufficient and only enough to alleviate the immediate disaster. A large sum of money is needed to handle relief and rehabilitation separately, otherwise, there is no way to start. The Ministry of Finance recently issued a telegram stating that the Ministry of Finance is discussing the issuance of disaster relief bonds with the Sichuan authorities, which is necessary. Our opinions are as follows: ㊀ The Sichuan authorities should quickly negotiate with the Ministry of Finance to determine the fund and issue Sichuan disaster relief bonds to handle various relief matters. ㊁ The leaders of the Sichuan party, government, military, and local communities should organize a Sichuan Disaster Relief Committee to manage public bonds and various donations and formulate various relief plans and be responsible for their implementation. ㊂ The Sichuan authorities should follow the example of disaster relief in other provinces, quickly reduce administration and salaries, and stop urgent matters in this year's policy plan and allocate their budget funds for relief. ㊃ The projects for which funds have been raised, such as the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and various highways, should be carried out quickly by the provincial government to remove obstacles. ㊄ All of Sichuan's existing cooperation fund of 3 million yuan should be used to manage cooperative agricultural loans by district, and the Agricultural Bank of China should be requested to send personnel to Sichuan to jointly manage cooperative credit unions with the provincial government by county. ㊅ Sichuan should quickly establish a water conservancy agency and allocate annual funds for a fundamental plan to revitalize agriculture and prevent natural disasters, which should be implemented step by step. The above six items are urgent tasks. We Sichuanese, whether in Sichuan or abroad, should first donate generously and do our best for this huge natural disaster. We should also earnestly ask people across the country to act with human sympathy and a spirit of mutual assistance and rescue, and actively donate to help the dying victims recover. This is what our colleagues in the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association sincerely pray for. (6th Central News Agency telegram)</p>

<h3>Japan-Soviet Relations and Japanese-Puppet Military Intelligence</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The fundamental transformation of relations between Japan and the Soviet Union is undoubtedly the responsibility of Japan. Two months ago, Japanese political circles held that "Japan and the Soviet Union should not engage in war for at least ten years." Five months ago, the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty was extended for one year. Relations between the two countries seemed to be gradually easing. However, Japan's demands on the Soviet Union, such as ㊀ establishing a border committee to resolve border issues, ㊁ withdrawing Far East armaments to resolve the so-called "Manchukuo" threat, and ㊂ ceasing communist propaganda to stabilize the so-called Far East security, have so far yielded no results. This is intolerable to the eager-to-succeed young Japanese military officers. The temporary peace between the two countries is due to two reasons: First, Japanese diplomats, aware of international isolation, have had to slightly change course. Second, the Soviet Union's rapid economic construction, the completion of the Far East "Maginot Line," and the aggressive expansion of its naval and air forces have made its strength very strong, forcing Japan to exercise some caution.</p>
<p>After Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev returned to Japan from the Soviet Union, he held several meetings with Japanese Foreign Minister Sato to improve relations between the two countries. The Soviet Union is most concerned about the Japan-Germany alliance. Yurenev frankly admitted to his opposition when he first arrived in Japan. Japan hopes to resolve outstanding issues, but these issues are the result of Japanese military actions. If Japan does not change its past policies and abandon its ambitions, these issues will not have a satisfactory outcome. This is certain. Japan-Soviet relations will likely remain in a state of uncertainty for some time.</p>
<p>However, to speculate on the negative side, relations between the two countries may very well deteriorate to the extreme. Japan's recent domestic unrest may trigger an external wave to divert the attention of the domestic population and maintain power. Therefore, we cannot but pay close attention to the recent movements of the puppet troops in Chahar Province, the Chengde meeting at the end of the month, and the rumored deployment of heavy Japanese and puppet troops in Duolun, Chengde, Jinzhou, Bu Kui, Manzhouli, Tongjiang, and Suifenhe. If these military activities do not imply that Japanese soldiers and diplomats are parting ways and starting anew, then they should serve to divert attention. In any case, the development of these activities is a great threat to peace in the Far East, and may lead to drastic changes in Japan-Soviet relations and Sino-Japanese relations.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Indictment from Wuhan District Court</h3>
<p>[Hankou] Since Liu Lu-yin, Gong Bo-zhou, Cao Bing-rong, and others were arrested and sent to Hubei after the assassination of Yang Yong-tai, the Wuhan District Court has accepted the case. Chief Prosecutor Wang Lian and High Court Prosecutor Zhu Chengzan repeatedly opened court for investigation, and the criminal facts of Liu and others have become clear. On the 4th of this month, a public prosecution was filed with the court's Criminal Division, and a public trial will be held within days. The full text of the indictment is as follows: Indictment by the Prosecutor of the Wuhan District Court of Hubei Province. Defendant Liu Lu-yin, male, 44 years old, from Yongfeng, Jiangxi, residing at No. 246 Pushi Road, Shanghai, Central Committee member; Gong Bo-zhou, also known as Gong Bo-sheng, Gong Shao-xian, Long Ding, male, 37 years old, from Xingren, Guizhou, residing in Nanjing, merchant; Cheng Xie-chao, also known as Tan Wen-xin, Tan Rong-xuan, Cheng Da, male, 28 years old, from Zhenyuan, Guizhou, unemployed; Cao Bing-rong, also known as Zhang Jia-yi, male, 29 years old, from Guizhou, residing on Minsheng Road, Hankou, unemployed; Yang Qi-xin, male, 20 years old, from Xingren, Guizhou, residing at Zhongying Middle School, Nanjing; Li Qun-jian, male, 16 years old, from Nantong, Jiangsu, student; Yang Xiao-ming, also known as Yang Er-qian, alias Xu Qun, Xu Chao, also known as Yang You-sheng, Yang Bo-kun, Yang Qi-zhen, male, from Guizhou, details unknown, at large; Xiao Zhun, also known as Xiao Pei-wei, male, from Guizhou, details unknown, at large; Fan Qi-shu, male, from Guizhou, details unknown, at large; Liang Jiu-bao, male, from Shanghai, details unknown, at large.</p>
<p>The defendants listed above are involved in the 1369th case of murder and disrupting public order in the 25th year of the Republic of China. After investigation, it is deemed that a public prosecution should be filed. The criminal facts, evidence, and applicable laws are described below.</p>
<p>Criminal Facts</p>
<p>Defendant Liu Lu-yin was once nominated as the Minister of Propaganda of the Central Party Department, but did not take office. Last year, the Southwest established the People's Movement Committee, and he was elected as a Standing Committee member. Out of jealousy of former Hubei Provincial Government Chairman Yang Yong-tai, former Foreign Minister Zhang Qun, Minister of Interior Jiang Zuo-bin, Minister of Communications Yu Fei-peng, and Chairman Chiang, he jointly instigated cadres Yang Xiao-ming (also known as Yang Er-qian, Yang You-sheng, Yang Bo-kun, Yang Qi-zhen, Xu Chao), using the alias Xu Qun, to organize an assassination organization in Shanghai to seek opportunities to assassinate them. In April of the same year, due to fewer opportunities in Shanghai, the organization was expanded, and the target was shifted to Nanjing and Hubei, with Shanghai still serving as the center of operations. Yang Xiao-ming, under the name of Xu Qun, drafted a plan, naming his organization the China Youth Anti-Japanese Eradication of Traitors Special Service Team, in order to appeal to the public and provide cover. Liu Lu-yin, using his authority as a Standing Committee member of the People's Movement Committee, approved the plan with the words "Monthly approval of 2,000 yuan, to be remitted by Ru Yun," (see Evidence No. 1). After the plan was approved, Yang Xiao-ming immediately summoned the fugitives Xiao Zhun (also known as Xiao Pei-wei), Fan Qi-shu, Liang Jiu-bao, and the defendants Yang Qi-xin (Yang Xiao-ming's younger cousin) and Gong Bo-zhou (Yang Xiao-ming's nephew, also known as Gong Bo-sheng, Gong Shao-xian, Long Ding), to actively proceed according to Liu Lu-yin's approved plan, and ordered team member Li Qun-jian to participate in communications work. In May of the same year, Yang Qi-xin and Gong Bo-zhou, at the behest of Xiao Zhun, went to Lushan to investigate Chairman Chiang's whereabouts. Considering that Guanyin Bridge was located in a remote area, making it convenient for sniping, Yang Qi-xin reported to Xiao Zhun (see the confessions of Yang Qi-xin and Gong Bo-zhou). In August, Yang Xiao-ming summoned Yang Qi-xin and Gong Bo-zhou to Shanghai and instructed them to return to Nanjing to investigate the whereabouts of former Foreign Minister Zhang Qun. He gave Gong Bo-zhou 70 yuan to buy a gun and go to Hankou to assassinate Chairman Yang. After Yang Qi-xin returned to Nanjing, he and Gong Bo-zhou conducted one joint investigation and two independent investigations. They believed that the location of the Overseas Chinese Guesthouse was suitable for an attack and informed Yang Xiao-ming to prepare for the assassination. Gong Bo-zhou purchased a pistol in Nanjing and brought it to Hankou for use. At that time, in September, Yang Xiao-ming had arrived in Hankou in advance, using the alias Xu Chao, and was living separately with Xiao Zhun, Fan Qi-shu, Liang Jiu-bao, and Cao Bing-rong (also known as Zhang Jia-yi) at No. 39 Sanjiao Street and the Xintai'an Inn. At that time, Fan Youcheng Xie-chao (also known as Tan Wen-xin, Tan Rong-xuan, Cheng Da) was also in Hankou and met Fan. Fan knew that Cheng was violent and capable of taking action and instigated him to join the assassination organization, taking on the responsibility of implementation and handing over a pistol he had privately purchased in July to Cheng Xie-chao for use. Yang Xiao-ming presided over everything, secretly providing photographs of Chairman Yang to the assassins for identification. Initially, Liang Jiu-bao was sent to the road on Sandao Street in Wuchang, which Chairman Yang was bound to pass through, to try to obstruct traffic when Chairman Yang passed by, so that Cheng Xie-chao and Gong Bo-zhou could take the opportunity to shoot. This was done twice in a row, but both times they hesitated and did not carry it out. They then changed to waiting on the road near the Provincial Government, but because of the strict security, it was difficult to attack. They then changed to the wharf on the riverside in Hankou to await an opportunity. On the morning of October 25, Yang Xiao-ming and Cao Bing-rong came to Wuchang to find out that Chairman Yang would be attending a banquet in Hankou, which would take two to three hours. They then followed Yang and, after the boat arrived at the Hankou bank, Yang Xiao-ming immediately ordered Cao Bing-rong to stand at the People's Question Office as a marker. On one side he returned to the Xintai'an Inn and ordered Cheng Xie-chao and Gong Bo-zhou to hold loaded pistols and wait at a wharf, secretly supervising and directing the scene. After three bell rings, Chairman Yang drove up and got out of the car and walked several steps. Cheng Xie-chao immediately approached from behind, pulled out his gun, and fired two shots at his back. Chairman Yang was caught off guard, and both bullets hit vital points. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he died soon after. Cheng Xie-chao was arrested on the spot. Liu Lu-yin, Gong Bo-zhou, Cao Bing-rong, Yang Qi-xin, Li Qun-jian, and others were also arrested in Yanhubeijing and Shanghai. The Hubei High Court ordered this court to investigate.

<h3>Sichuan Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Disaster Areas for Relief Distribution</h3>
<p>Secretary-General Deng Convenes Relief Personnel for Discussion, Elaborating on Relief Methods and Highlighting Key Points</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: After Chairman Zhu Ziqiao of the Relief Committee came to Sichuan, he has been consulting with Chairman Liu Fucheng for days regarding disaster relief. It has now been decided to select the 26 most severely affected counties and the 46 next most severely affected counties from the 140 disaster-stricken counties in the province. Initially, 2 million yuan will be allocated, comprising 1 million yuan from the central government and 1 million yuan raised by the provincial government. The remaining funds will be reserved to supplement relief efforts in other counties. Meanwhile, investigators will be dispatched to various counties to verify the disaster situation and distribute relief tickets in accordance with the Relief Association's investigation and distribution regulations. Secretary-General Deng Mingjie of the Provincial Government convened a meeting with the investigators before their departure. He spoke in great detail about the disaster situation in the province and the relief measures. The gist of his remarks is recorded below:</p>
<p>A Bad Harvest Follows Great Disorder</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, you are about to depart for the disaster areas to investigate and distribute urgent relief. Your task is exceptionally important. Wherever you go, you must ensure that officials, gentry, and the common people alike are fully aware of the government's determination to thoroughly rescue the people, as well as their own responsibilities. Only through joint efforts can we achieve success. I will briefly outline the main points. A bad harvest inevitably follows great disorder. This saying from the ancients is derived from experience. When the bandits were defeated last year and the military campaign to suppress them came to an end, the heads of various departments of the provincial government, under the leadership of Chairman Liu, handled the aftermath. They had already recognized that Sichuan farmers, after more than a decade of devastation, had no stored grain at home and were struggling to survive. Therefore, they actively promoted beneficial measures, such as repairing warehouses to regulate grain supply, promoting cooperation, establishing a disaster relief reserve fund management committee, assisting the Provincial Relief Association, supervising charitable organizations in cities and counties, and improving local relief homes. These were all included in the administrative outline for the 25th year. Furthermore, they actively promoted production and construction, aiming to ensure that all 70 million people could have ample food and clothing and be able to withstand natural disasters even if they occurred. For example, they completed the measurement of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System to benefit farmland irrigation, established meteorological stations to determine rainfall, completed hydrological stations to centralize water level reports, and simultaneously improved rice and wheat varieties, tested late rice, paddy rice, double-cropping rice, improved silkworm breeds, tested cotton cultivation, and improved sugarcane, tung oil, citrus fruits, and various other crops. In addition, there were preparations for the development of animal husbandry, forestry, and minerals. These were also included in the administrative outline for the 25th year and implemented step by step. The above measures were the responsibilities that the government should fulfill, as the ancients said, 'A bad harvest inevitably follows disorder,' and we had to think about prevention in advance. The original intention was to enable the people to live and work in peace and restore their long-damaged vitality. Unexpectedly, Heaven has not yet ended its disasters and has once again dealt a severe blow to the people of Sichuan. Last year's autumn drought and this year's spring famine have already caused great suffering to the people, and the recent shortage of rainfall makes this year's autumn harvest not very reliable. If such a major disaster occurred in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, where transportation is convenient, it would not be difficult to provide a steady stream of relief. However, we now face financial difficulties and inconvenient transportation. For example, the grain purchased in Wuhu and other places has not yet been fully repaid. Therefore, it is truly difficult for Sichuan today to raise large sums of money and purchase large quantities of grain for distribution and price stabilization. However, the government's duty is to do what is right, and conscience drives us. How dare we be daunted by difficulties? We will exhaust every possible means to plan and implement measures to provide relief and overcome this difficult situation. I will briefly discuss with you what we have learned. According to formal reports from various associations, a total of 140 counties in the province have been affected by the disaster. Among them, the severely affected counties, which should be given priority, include Qijiang, Nanxi, Jiang'an, and Hejiang, totaling 26 counties. The next most severely affected counties are Neijiang, Rongxian, Renshou, and Weiyuan, totaling 46 counties. The lightly affected counties are Wenjiang and Huayang, totaling 68 counties. According to recent surveys and statistics, the 26 most severely affected counties have approximately 6 million disaster victims, and the 46 next most severely affected counties have approximately 13 million disaster victims. Statistics for the 68 lightly affected counties have not yet been compiled, but it is feared that they will also be no less than 10 million. In total, the province has over 30 million disaster victims. Among them, those capable of working, based on the number of able-bodied men, are only over 4.6 million. However, there must be quite a few people other than able-bodied men who can work. According to the report of the personnel sent by the Provincial Food Survey Association to inspect 35 counties including Xuanhan and Jiang'an, the grain reserves in each county are at most sufficient for two months. The grain shortage before the autumn harvest is about 50,000 to 60,000 dan per county, and it is difficult for grain from outside to enter the area. The starving people are unable to afford to buy food. If this year's autumn harvest is also poor, the future will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Government Initiatives</p>
<p>The government's disaster relief initiatives include: ❶ Urgent relief: The Provincial Relief Association has allocated 140,000 yuan from this year's initial disaster relief reserve fund to the severely affected counties for urgent relief to the elderly and weak. The 1 million yuan in government bonds allocated by the central government, after being discounted to 700,000 yuan, along with the 1 million yuan raised by the provincial government, will all be used for urgent relief, with personnel dispatched to various counties to investigate and distribute the funds. ❷ Agricultural loans: The Provincial Cooperative Treasury has allocated 1 million yuan to handle emergency relief in the severely and next most severely affected counties, organizing preparatory cooperatives to provide loans to farmers. The Joint Committee can allocate another 2 million yuan for this purpose. Furthermore, to stabilize rural areas as a fundamental solution to the disaster, a special request has been made to issue 12 million yuan in provincial government bonds, which can be mortgaged for 6 million yuan in cash. After using 1 million yuan to make up for the shortfall in urgent relief, the remaining 5 million yuan will be used as a special fund to promote agricultural loans in the disaster-stricken counties and to subsidize the insufficient funding for local public works projects in various counties. Furthermore, since the loans are still limited, the Provincial Council has resolved that the provincial government will be responsible for guaranteeing loans to rural areas in the disaster-stricken areas from major banks inside and outside the province, with a total amount of 12 million yuan. ❸ Grain exemption: Based on the number of severely affected counties that reached the disaster threshold after last year's autumn harvest, the provincial government sent personnel to investigate the results and, as of the end of March, approved the exemption of nearly 2 million yuan in grain taxes. The remaining amount is still under review, and it is estimated that the total amount of grain tax exemption will reach about 5 to 6 million yuan. ❹ Tax deferral: The provincial government, recognizing that disaster victims are currently unable to pay grain taxes, has issued a special order to the disaster-stricken counties to suspend the collection of grain taxes in the months of May, June, July, and August of this year to alleviate the people's burden. ❺ Price stabilization: To regulate the food supply, the provincial government has borrowed 3 million yuan from the Bank of China and 2 million yuan from the financial community in Chongqing to purchase rice from outside the province, which will be transported to Sichuan in batches for the counties to purchase for price stabilization. Other counties have raised funds on their own to handle price stabilization, totaling no less than 3 million yuan. ❻ Public works relief: In addition to instructing the county governments to order the district and baojia chiefs to supervise the able-bodied disaster victims to engage in the construction of ponds and dikes, with the owners providing food, or to repair roads and dredge rivers, with the local area providing food, Chairman Liu has also decided to allocate 4.2 million yuan from the construction bond project for public works relief, including the reorganization of the Zhilong section of the Sichuan-Yunnan Road and the Jianqu section of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road. The more than 1.39 million yuan allocated for food for the laborers is part of this fund. After the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway begins, the labor cost is estimated at 4 million yuan. The reconstruction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway via the northern route has been negotiated with the railway company for a subsidy of 600,000 yuan, all of which will be used for public works relief. ❼ Sheltering the elderly and weak: The provincial government has issued an order to the disaster-stricken counties to establish shelters for orphans and helpless children and the elderly and disabled among the disaster victims, with the county governments raising funds to operate them and the provincial government providing appropriate subsidies. ❽ Donating salaries for relief: The provincial government stipulates that civil servants will donate salaries for relief. The measures are as follows: A. Appointed officials and commissioned positions will donate one day's income. B. Appointed officials will donate two days' income. C. Senior officials will donate three days' income. The military is ordered to follow suit. Regarding the military, the Pacification Headquarters has also issued an order that lieutenants donate one day's income, field officers donate two days' income, and generals donate three days' income. Once the donations are collected, they will be sent to the relief organizations for distribution.</p>
<p>Other Effective Methods</p>
<p>As for other effective methods, the provincial government has issued orders to implement the following: ❶ Each county should form a joint guarantee and establish a temporary relief branch to investigate families with surplus resources and lend money and grain to nearby disaster victims, to be repaid at harvest time. ❷ Funds from ancestral halls and temples should be appropriately allocated for loans, prioritizing relatives and then neighbors. ❸ Local non-essential public funds should be diverted for relief. ❹ Technicians in each county should work hard to combat drought, going to the countryside from time to time to explain drought-resistant methods and teach drought-resistant farming techniques, etc. Chairman Liu has exhausted his efforts to raise and lend funds, as mentioned above. However, considering the extent of the disaster area at present, the effectiveness of relief is still limited. It is still hoped that local officials and gentry will find ways to help themselves, raising public and private funds for relief. In addition, they should solicit donations from various sources, accumulating small amounts to make a large sum, to expand relief efforts. The above is just a brief overview of the main points. Gentlemen, when you arrive in the disaster areas, you must widely publicize this information so that everyone is aware. As for the precautions for investigating the disaster, there is a separate document issued to you for your reference, so I will not elaborate further."</p>
<h3>Ancient Artifacts from the Han Dynasty Continuously Unearthed in Zhaotong County, Yunnan Province</h3>
<p>Gold, Stone, and Bronze Artifacts are all Famous Masterpieces</p>
<p>Zhaotong Correspondence: Zhaotong County is a major county in eastern Yunnan, bordering Sichuan to the north, and receiving Central Plains culture the earliest. Therefore, in the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty, the Han Dynasty Meng Xiaoju Stele was discovered there, which is one of the few ancient inscriptions in the country. Several years ago, archaeologist Zhang Xilu also discovered the "Yangjia Second Year, Qiongdu Made" Double Fish Washer and Han Steamer from the Eastern Han Dynasty under Emperor Shun. "Qiongdu" is recorded in the "Records of the Grand Historian: Biographies of the Southwestern Barbarians," which proves the early culture of the area.</p>
<p>Zhang Xilu, who roams the country, has a good understanding of antiquities. This spring, he arrived in Zhaotong and often said that antiquities are closely related to culture and should be collected and preserved at any time to promote local cultural relics. Lin Fa, a gardener at the local People's Education Hall, heard Zhang's words. When he returned to his village, Caojia Laobao (a village name, eight miles east of Zhaotong City), he dug up a pile of beams and discovered a right-angled stone. The entire piece was painted with vermilion. He washed it and ran to tell Mr. Zhang with an expression of remorse, saying that he originally wanted to dig up some ancient coins to give as a gift, but unexpectedly found nothing of value. Zhang said that since no coins were found, the stone was also needed. So he hired someone to bring it over. It turned out to be a statue inscription from the Han Dynasty. A crane was carved on the back, a tortoise and snake on the left, and a phoenix on the right. On the front are the nine characters "Made in the Wuzi Year of the Third Month of Jianchu Nine Years." The characters are one inch in diameter and in the Han official script. The character "year" has been more than half peeled off. According to Emperor Zhang of the Han Dynasty, "Jianchu" only lasted for eight years, and the following year the era name was changed to "Yuanhe." Using the "Biography of Emperor Zhang" in the Later Han Dynasty, the stems and branches in February and April of the first year of Yuanhe advanced, and there was indeed "Wuzi" in March. Probably the news of the change of era name by Emperor Zhang to "Yuanhe" was delayed due to the distance. The record of the Xiaocuan Stele in the eighth year is also the same mistake. The inscription is a square solid slanted upwards, with a height of 1.65 Yingzao chi, each side 8.5 cun, three lines of characters with three characters in each line. A hole is drilled at the top. According to the gardener's own description, a bronze Buddha statue with a handle was unearthed there several years ago, which could be inserted into the hole in this stone. Then this inscription is the seat of a Buddha statue from the Han Dynasty, which proves that Buddhism spread to Yunnan, China, very early, and may have entered China from India through southern Yunnan. This remains to be proven by subsequent antiquities.</p>
<p>After Mr. Zhang examined it, he went to Caojia Laobao to inspect it himself and ordered the gardener to continue digging down a foot or so. Under the Han Dynasty flower brick wall, he discovered a Han Dynasty Five-Zhu Flower Tree Coin, with the fruits between the stems and leaves all in the shape of Five-Zhu Coins. The copper has turned entirely clumsy green, with some corrosion and peeling off, but it is quaint and charming. It is an ancient artifact that has never been recorded by epigraphers. From this, one can imagine that the craftsmanship of the Han Dynasty in Yunnan had reached sophistication. The unearthed artifact immediately shocked people throughout the city, who came to borrow it for viewing. Mr. Zhang exhausted his savings in Caojia Laobao to study it. He successively discovered the Han Jianchu Zhuti Double Fish Device and Insect and Fish Device. The two devices weigh about twenty-odd jins each and are extremely strange and ancient in shape. They were unearthed from the same hole at the same time. One device has an inscription with characters such as "Made in Zhuti in Jianchu..." The seal script Yang Wen examines "Zhuti", which is the ancient name of Zhaotong County, which has been seen in various books such as the Book of the Former and Later Han Dynasty Water Classic Commentary. "Jianchu" is also the era name of Emperor Zhang of the Han Dynasty, and like the previous stone, it occupies the first place among Yunnan's antiquities, breaking all previous records of Yunnan's antiquities, which is enough to add luster to the culture of the Southwest. The device without inscription has two fish sandwiched between an insect in the middle and is relatively large. It was unearthed from the same hole as the previous device and should undoubtedly be a Jianchu object. Moreover, its copper quality and production are also very similar. He also discovered many Han Dynasty bronze artifacts of various sizes. "A Han Nanyi Chief's Seal" and "A Han Fish Washer" are all valuable items. The Han Dynasty flower brick wall in Caojia Laobao spans hundreds of blocks horizontally and vertically. Mr. Zhang persuaded the villagers not to move it and to preserve it for visitors from China and abroad to visit and study. As for the scattered antiquities and broken bricks, they were transported to Zhaotong Provincial Middle School in the city to prepare for the future fundraising and display. As for photos or rubbings of this antiquity, if anyone seeks them, they can write to Mr. Zhang at Zhaotong Middle School, Yunnan.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Planning to Build the Su-Dong Road</p>
<p>Dongting East Mountain is an important town in the western countryside of Wuxian County, with abundant agricultural products and a relatively developed commercial sector. Unfortunately, transportation is not very convenient. Now, Wang Shujie, Fan Junbo, and more than 30 others have jointly initiated the construction of the Su-Dong Highway. They once had an informal discussion and decided to proceed with the plan. The highway will start from the Suzhou City Railway Station, pass through Mudu, Ducun, and Hengjing, and reach Dongting East Mountain. The entire road is about 90 Chinese li. Except for the section from Suzhou to Mudu, which has been built by the Su-Fu Company and is accessible to public buses, the section from Mudu to East Mountain, which is about 50 li, requires more than 100,000 yuan. The initiators have scheduled a meeting of the initiators at 2:00 PM tomorrow (the 8th) at the Farmer's Building on Guanqian Street to discuss the direction of progress.</p>

<p>Large-Scale Air Defense Drill in the City</p>
<p>The county government held a large-scale air defense drill. On the afternoon of the 4th, an inspection was first held at the sports field, with more than 3,000 participants. At about 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th, the bell rang to issue an air raid alert. The traffic team implemented traffic control, and all shops closed immediately. Land and water transportation were completely cut off. Passers-by were led by the evacuation team to various shelters. At the same time, the security team searched for spies. Then a poison gas alert was issued. There were five places where poison gas bombs were assumed to have been dropped. The disinfection team and the rescue team went to disinfect them separately. Flags were inserted to warn of the poisonous area, and the injured people were carried to the hospital. At 3:30, the all-clear was issued and everything returned to normal. At 7:40, the air raid alert was re-issued, and traffic control was carried out again. At the same time, blackout measures were implemented. The baojia chiefs restricted all indoor and outdoor lights in the area to be turned off, and the indoor lights were covered. Then a bombing alert was issued. There were five places where incendiary bombs were dropped and caught fire. The fire brigade went to put out the fire separately. At 8:00, the all-clear was issued and everything returned to normal. All agencies, schools, groups, and baojia chiefs participated in this drill. The people of the county had suffered from enemy bombing, so they were very excited. Although it was a hypothetical drill, their spirit was very full.</p>

<p>Causes and Consequences of the Sand Field Dispute</p>
<p>The sand field dispute in Shazhou City has recently resulted in another armed fight. Both sides are currently seeking legal solutions, but the causes of the dispute are extremely complex. According to those familiar with the sand field situation, in 1920, Xue Xian'de, a giant Jiangyin dye merchant, reported to the Sand Field Bureau that he had obtained 26,000 mu of滩地 to organize the Houde Company. In 1922, the Fuli Company reported to the Sand Field Bureau that it had obtained more than 100,000 mu of Nanjia灘地. According to custom, the Fuli Company could only build after the Houde Company had completed the construction. Later, to avoid disputes, the two parties signed a non-infringement treaty, with a 3:1 profit split. Over the past decade or so, the Fuli Company has built more than 40,000 mu through Qian Yumen's enclosure, while Houde has only received several hundred mu, a huge difference. This spring, Houde hired workers from the Xinji Construction Company to enclose the area themselves. Then Rong Desheng, a Wuxi giant merchant and director of Fuli, intervened to mediate, and the two parties still handled the matter according to the previous agreement. It could have proceeded peacefully, but internal disputes arose within the Fuli Company. The former director, Qian Yumen, opposed the previous agreement and tried his best to grab the enclosure, causing the Fuli Company to be divided into old and new factions, which led to the bloody tragedy on the 27th of last month.</p>

<p>Building a New-Style Cocoon Bank</p>
<p>Recently, Cheng Bingruo, the manager of Gansheng Silk Factory, and others purchased 16 mu of land near the Nanpanjia Bridge Dongtu in Jilangbang, Yangxi Township, the third district, to build a new-style cocoon bank, named Xinan Machine Cocoon Bank. Construction began in early March and is scheduled to be completed before the spring cocoons go on the market. The cocoon drying stove in this machine cocoon bank is different from the old-style cocoon drying stove. It uses a water-heater cocoon dryer, which can dry about 800 dan of cocoons each time. It is said that the factory is also building the same machine cocoon drying stoves in Lishi, Daixiang, and Gangchu in the ninth district to promote it.</p>

The Jin County Magistrate has approved the order to stop it.</p>
<p>Civilian Armed Fight in Cixi Township</p>
<p>For days, the villagers in the western townships of Cixi have been welcoming the Saining Hui and Dongyue Hui festivals. Among them, the villagers of Sujia Village near Shushan and the villagers of Xianchi Village had long had a grudge because of the Dongyue Hui festival in the past. At first, they cursed each other, then they pushed and trampled each other, and finally, both sides used dragon-footed wooden sticks, flagpoles, and copper-tin staffs as weapons to engage in a fierce fight. There were five or six hundred people on each side, and the order was in chaos. Then the Changjing Police Station of the Zhangting Public Security Bureau led the police to rush to mediate, which lasted for two hours before they persuaded them to separate. Each side suffered five or six seriously injured people whose lives were in danger. They have each requested the county government to investigate the injuries and punish the murderers. In addition, after the Xinyangshan Hui, Guanhaiwei in northern Cixi also greatly welcomed the festival. The other day, when they welcomed it to Tangjia Bridge in Shenshi Bridge, gunmen from the Xiafang Gang and the Hongjia Gang suddenly clashed for some unknown reason, each holding iron guns and shooting randomly at people, injuring more than a dozen people. Among them, one from the Xiafang Gang had his eyeball shot out, and his injury was very serious.</p>

<h3>The German-Italian Military Agreement Becomes a Mystery in the European Situation</h3>
<p>One Says Principles Have Been Set, Germany Still Denies. Austria and Czechoslovakia Will Move Towards London</p>
<p>[Rome] German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Rome has ended today. Neurath firmly denied any military alliance between Italy and Germany. It is heard that Neurath had a long discussion with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano about the overall situation in Spain. It is now believed that both the Italian and German governments are willing to withdraw their volunteer soldiers from Spain, and plan to withdraw them when it does not damage their prestige. It is said that this opportunity may come when the Nationalist army captures Bilbao. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Diplomatic circles here learned today that Germany and Italy have reached a military agreement in principle. From now on, Germany can act freely in Austria, but must guarantee never to invade the Italian border at the Brenner Pass. The French side believes that Italy's move has recognized the economic merger of Germany and Austria. It is claimed that Austria has learned the contents of the agreement, but hopes that Britain and France can re-declare and guarantee the territorial integrity of Austria. The above agreement was negotiated by German Aviation Minister General Göring and Foreign Minister Neurath with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano. If German Army Minister von Blomberg does not personally go to Italy, he may send a senior staff officer as a representative to Rome to draft the provisions of the agreement. (National News, 5th)</p>
<p>[London] As King George VI holds the coronation ceremony, Central European countries will send important envoys to congratulate him. It is generally expected that Foreign Minister Eden will take the opportunity to conduct important talks with Czech Prime Minister Hodža, Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt, and Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul. It is heard that Hodža and Schmidt have raised a question to the British government, asking for a clear answer, that is, what attitude will Britain take regarding the current encroachment of German forces into Central European countries? Are the Western European democracies more concerned about the fate of Austria and Czechoslovakia than before, or will they sit idly by as the political axis organized by Germany and Italy leads the Central European countries and ignores them? All these are what Austria and Czechoslovakia want to know. It is also heard that Czech Prime Minister Hodža will be the central figure in these informal talks and will put forward the so-called "Hodža Plan," the purpose of which is to seek economic cooperation among the countries in the Danube River basin. This economic cooperation does not exclude Germany and Italy, but it does not allow each country to control the countries participating in the future Danube Agreement. In addition, well-informed sources also believe that after Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt comes to London, he may ask Britain and France to issue a joint declaration on the issue of Austrian independence.

As for Zhejiang Province, the implementation of opium suppression in recent years has achieved remarkable results. The two chairmen, Lu and Huang, laid the foundation for it, and the current Chairman Zhu is making even greater efforts to advance it. Recently, the Anti-Drug Campaign Group of Zhejiang Province was jointly organized by the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Office of the Special Commissioner for Opium Suppression, and the Provincial Anti-Drug Association. Representatives were assigned to carry a large number of propaganda materials to various counties in Taiwen Prefecture to carry out work, striving to promote Chiang Kai-shek's policy of opium and drug suppression to the people, and the responsibilities that the people should bear for anti-drug work. At the same time, the Opium Suppression Office instructed its representatives to take the opportunity to inspect the opium suppression situation in various counties, and to attach the examination work.

As for the general investigation and reporting of opium planting in the province, the provincial government issued proclamations and slogans before the opium seedling planting period, instructing them to be posted. During the period when the opium seedlings emerged, officials were dispatched to jointly investigate and ban them with the county magistrates. Now, the provincial government and the Office of the Special Commissioner for Opium Suppression, in accordance with the regulations for the implementation of opium and drug suppression, have formulated twelve detailed implementation measures for the general investigation to be carried out in various counties, which were jointly approved by the chairman and the special commissioner, and Ling Gongchen, Zhu Jinwan, Shen Tongyuan, Jin Licheng, Huang Shijie, and Shou Zhenxin were assigned as commissioners. After being summoned by the special commissioner for a conversation, they departed simultaneously the day before yesterday to various districts to supervise the district and county commissioners in implementing the detailed measures, which are as follows: (1) These measures are formulated in accordance with Article 8 of the organizational regulations of the offices of special commissioners for opium suppression in various provinces and cities promulgated by the government, and Article 20 of the regulations for the implementation of opium and drug suppression. (2) The provincial government and the Office of the Special Commissioner for Opium Suppression in Zhejiang and Shanghai will jointly send personnel to various districts to conduct investigations on a county-by-county basis. If the Administrative Inspector's Office and the county government also each send one person to jointly investigate, the scope of the investigation is as follows: (1) Those who plant opium seedlings; (2) Those who gather crowds to resist the eradication of opium seedlings; (3) Those who transport, sell, or collect opium poppy seeds; (4) Public officials and local bullies at all levels who fail to enforce the ban, protect, indulge, and collude with opium planters, etc. (2) The deadline for the general investigation in various counties this year is set at two months, from May 1 to June 3, and shall not be extended. The areas are based on the past opium suppression experiences. The commissioners are instructed to implement it accordingly. (3) The investigating commissioners shall be under the command and supervision of the chairman of the provincial government and the Special Commissioner for Opium Suppression in Zhejiang and Shanghai. (4) After arriving in the district, the investigating commissioners shall jointly, with the commissioners sent by the Administrative Inspector's Office, go to various counties in turn, and together with the county personnel, lead the district, township, and baojia chiefs, to go deep into the countryside to conduct thorough inspections. The investigation dates and site allocations in various counties shall be determined temporarily by the committee and the district and county authorities after considering the circumstances. (5) In villages where banditry has not been quelled, the army shall encircle and suppress them before conducting investigations. If obstacles are encountered, a special report shall be submitted for approval to temporarily suspend the investigation. In villages that have just been disrupted by bandits and order has been initially restored, the nearby garrison troops shall be consulted to conduct inspections together. (6) Counties that have never planted opium must submit a written guarantee from the county magistrate stating that if opium seedlings are found in the territory, they are willing to be sentenced to death, and they may be exempted from investigation. However, if the special commissioner believes that there is a need for investigation, he may still conduct spot checks as appropriate. (7) In order to ensure thorough and strict investigation, the special commissioner may still personally inspect various districts and counties at any time. The departure date and location shall not be notified by command. (8) When the investigating commissioner arrives in a county, the entry and exit and investigation completion reports shall be filled out in triplicate and submitted to the provincial government and the Office of the Special Commissioner for Opium Suppression in Zhejiang and Shanghai for verification and transfer. If a major incident occurs or emergency measures are required, it shall also be reported to the authorities by telegram for verification. (9) The general anti-drug investigation was completed last year. In order to conduct thorough inspection and assessment, the anti-drug affairs may be inspected in the areas where the general opium planting investigation is carried out this time. If there are any criminals who transport, sell, manufacture, or consume drugs, as well as public officials and local bullies who protect, indulge, or collude with drug criminals, they shall be arrested and severely punished nearby.

<p>My country's exports of vegetable oil and materials last year were estimated at 150 million yuan, which is of great importance to the rural economy. The China Vegetable Oil Factory Co., Ltd., jointly operated by the Ministry of Industry and the official and commercial sectors of Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, has a total capital of 2 million yuan, specializing in promoting the improvement of the quality, transportation, and sales of my country's oil production. Since its establishment last autumn, it has made rapid progress.</p>
<p>A total of three oil pool factories have been established in Shanghai, Hankou, and Wanxian, specializing in acting as agents for merchants to chemically test, store, and refine various oils, and issue warehouse receipts for transfers and pledges. In the past half year, the local oil merchants' finances have been adjusted, which has been highly praised. Five factories in Wuhu, Changsha, Changde, Chongqing, and Hangzhou are under construction and will be completed in early autumn this year. Appropriate for the oil season, business offices have been established in Shanghai, Hankou, Changsha, Changde, Wuhu, Chenzhou, Qu County, Chongqing, Wanxian, Yichang, Shashi, Wenzhou, and other places, undertaking convenient sales affairs for merchants. In the past half year, the total turnover is said to be nearly 10 million yuan. The oils directly exported to foreign countries include tung oil, tea oil, cottonseed oil, pine oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, and various oil cakes. Recently, it has also been actively promoting the use of machines to press tung oil. Although this move has been promoted domestically in recent years, it has been limited to written suggestions or small-scale research in chemical laboratories. Now, after large-scale trials by the factory, machine pressing can save 2 yuan and 48 cents per load compared with local soil pressing. The first machine-pressed tung oil has been shipped to the United States. The quality is similar to the tung oil pressed by machines from tung seeds grown in the United States. The price is also higher than that of ordinary tung oil in my country due to its excellent quality. According to the original purpose of the Ministry of Industry in establishing the factory, exported tung oil is divided into four grades according to the quality, which is more scientific than the ordinary exported tung oil with water, impurities, and no grade separation. In the future, my country's tung oil will surely be more welcomed overseas, and gradually eliminate the move of the United States to grow tung trees itself. In addition to tung oil, it is also actively paying attention to promoting other special agricultural vegetable oils in my country. For example, tea oil was exported for about 1.5 million yuan last year. The factory recently invented a simple method of testing tea oil to teach merchants in various places to conduct their own tests when purchasing. The reason is that due to the Spanish Civil War last year, the export of olive oil was reduced, so the export of tea oil was quite prosperous and the price was relatively high. However, the bad habits of merchants have been revived, and other oils are added to seek profits. The testing method is easy to implement and is a good way to ensure the quality of tea oil. The factory currently has three kinds of oil pressing machines purchased from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom for comparative research, and plans to design its own suitable oil pressing machine after the trial. The reason is that European, American, and Japanese countries have no production of tung oil and tea oil, so it is inevitable that there will be some separation. Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry visited the factory at 8:00 a.m. on April 23 when he came to Shanghai a few days ago. Yu Jianqiu, the managing director and director of the Hunan Construction Department, also came to Shanghai a few days ago to visit the factory, and both praised it highly. Recently, the factory held the second meeting of the Standing Committee in the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing on May 4, reporting the work that has been done in the past six months and the goals to be promoted in the future. In addition, Juxingcheng Trading Department, the only Chinese merchant tung oil export organization in my country, has a long history and has decided to cooperate with the factory in a practical manner. It is also heard that Yang Jijun, the manager of the department, has been hired as the assistant manager by the factory's Standing Committee a few days ago to preside over the tung oil business affairs.</p>

<h3>General Labor Union Issues Order for Caution in Strikes and Slowdowns</h3>
<p>The General Labor Union of this city issued a document to the municipal labor unions under its jurisdiction yesterday, stating that in order to comply with the order, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters Executive Committee issued an instruction, No. 2829, which stated that the Central Executive Committee's Public Training Department issued a letter, No. 7100, which stated that in the event of labor-management disputes, there shall be no threats of suspension of work or strikes until after mediation has failed, so as not to cause harm to both labor and management. In addition to separate letters, please handle accordingly, etc. Accordingly, recently in this city there have been labor disputes one after another, both labor and management have been harmed, which not only affects the national economy, but also the social order. As such, there should be an immediate stop to such disputes, in the future for labor-management disputes, labor is not allowed to undertake a strike or work slowdown until after legal mediation has failed, and management is even more forbidden to shut down businesses or fire laborers without reason, causing a repeat of the disputes. Aside from issuing an order to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for them to observe the order, we hasten to issue an order so that all under jurisdiction of the union should observe and not disobey.” As such, labor-management cooperation, increased production, and ethnic revitilization must be an important part of the movement, as this city is the national economic hub. The prosperity of the industrial and commercial trades heavily influences national economic development, and we can not let labor-management disputes run rampant, and allow that harm befall the national people. The preceding order has been separately issued, and as such we hasten to issue an order so that all under jurisdiction of the union should observe and not disobey.”</p>
<h3>Address by Madame Chiang at the Annual Meeting of the National Christian Council</h3>
<p>May the New Life Movement Cooperate with the Church and Advance</p>
<p>The 11th Annual Meeting of the National Christian Council of China held its first session yesterday morning at the New Asia Restaurant. Over a hundred representatives attended. The meeting was chaired by President Dr. Wu Yifang, and Vice President Dr. Liu Zhansi. The General Secretary of the Council, Chen Wenyuan, delivered a speech entitled "The Transformation of the Times and the Christian Movement." In the afternoon, the meeting was divided into four groups for discussion. The first group discussed "The Life of Christianity in a Changing Era," the second group discussed "Christian Ministry," the third group discussed "Cooperation," and the fourth group discussed "Christian Relations," which included discussions about the New Life Movement. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. In the evening, Madame Chiang Song Meiling, Director of the Women's Guidance Committee of the New Life Movement, delivered a speech. Her speech was read aloud by Dr. Wu Yifang, President of the Council and Director of the Women's Group of the New Life Movement Promotion Association. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>What society hopes from the Church is that it can solve the pressing problems of the present. If the social atmosphere is filled with a poisonous and turbid environment, then a strong religious faith will not only protect believers like a gas mask, shielding them from the invasion of the poisonous atmosphere, but will also blow away the turbid atmosphere like a fresh breeze from the sky, clearing the heavens for the masses to live in peace. We are gathered here today to discuss the relationship between the Church and the current environment in China, so that we may be alerted that the Church should no longer be isolated and independent from the development of modern China. The whole of China is now on the road to progress, and the Church should accompany it and advance together, knowing that we must fight against deeply rooted social evils and pave the way for a bright future in the new era. The New Life Movement in China, like the rising sun, is sounding its clear horn.</p>
<p>1.  A Call to Advance and Endure</p>
<p>Those who criticize the New Life Movement often say, "The most pressing problem for the masses is livelihood, but the New Life Movement has not made efforts in this regard." I offer this comment to you and share the responsibility with you. I recall that in the summer of 1933, I was invited to participate in a discussion held in Guling to study Christianity and Communism. At that time, I found that Christians discussed the issue of livelihood from a purely academic standpoint. I immediately felt the need to take practical action in the practice of our faith. Subsequently, the National Christian Council cooperated with the government to organize eleven rural experimental districts in Jiangxi, enabling young men and women from church schools and other schools to lead and study the most pressing problems of ordinary farmers. The Committee Chairman and I will never forget that the Church can cooperate with us in managing the work of revitalizing and recovering the bandit areas. I hope that this will be the starting point for a large-scale movement to improve the lives of the people, and that in the future it will be further developed and achieve even more impressive results.</p>
<p>The main reason why the Church is slow to participate in the rural revival movement may be due to the difficulty of this work. When we are in this situation, we should frankly admit that the virtues of endurance and hard work of Christian warriors are not what we are accustomed to, and this especially exposes our shortcomings of weakness and incompetence. As the prophet King said, "I am at ease in Jerusalem." When I accompanied my husband on his travels through the provinces, I encountered devout Christians living in remote rural areas, and those who came into contact with them were moved by a sense of new life. At that time, I was deeply surprised that there was no shortage of talented Chinese men and women with modern education, but I had not seen anyone go to those remote areas to carry out the same work, nor could I find anyone to assist those male missionaries from the sidelines. Is it that Chinese Christians with modern training are not as naturally gifted as others? Or do we only know how to accept the benefits of religious belief and are unwilling to bear this arduous responsibility? We should know that at the core of our faith is the symbol of hardship, endurance, and tribulation, which is the cross. If we lack this virtue, what Christian faith can we speak of? I once heard the Committee Chairman say that Christ, as a young man, was willing to sacrifice his life for the sake of righteousness. If we cannot follow and emulate him, how can we solve all the major problems of the present? This is why the Committee Chairman believes that Christianity is a revolutionary religion, and that all those who have religious faith today should be revolutionaries.</p>
<p>If what I say is correct and is welcomed by you, then today's meeting should study whether we should prepare to be soldiers fighting for Jesus Christ, abandon the tedious work in the distant rear, and throw ourselves into the bloody battle in the forefront of the battlefield. In today's difficult era, human and national strength are subjected to extreme trials, and the strong Christian spirit warns us that we should have the perseverance to overcome all difficulties. The transformation of the times depends on the proportion to which we can inject our faith, personality, and enthusiasm into it to promote it. I measure the effectiveness of a drug by the size of its effect to test its goodness or badness. We should also measure the truth or falsehood of our faith by the impact it has on ourselves and society. Today, we must firmly hear the sound of God's calling, and immediately make a decision to sacrifice our lives without hesitation, let alone the comfort of life.</p>
<p>Knowledge and action are inseparable, and we are indeed commissioned to turn faith into action. China today is like someone who has just awakened from a deep sleep, looking around in surprise at how easily its environment has changed. In this new environment, if the Church can advance through hardship, it will surely occupy an important position.</p>
<p>2.  The New Life Movement as a Call to Close Cooperation</p>
<p>The Christian faith is not only a social creed, but also a manifestation of God. What is meant by manifestation must have its essence. In today's terms, what God wants to show us is the needs of society and what kind of active contribution we should make to society. May the backward churches in the East and the advanced churches in the West work together to create a new life foundation for the residents of cities and towns. Trees bear fruit in response to the call of the seasons, and fields bear ears of grain in response to the call of the seasons. The new China will also make a bright contribution in response to the call of seasonal cooperation from Western churches. I would like to extend my husband and my sincere invitation to Western churches to participate in the New Life Movement and work in closer cooperation.</p>
<p>In terms of current cooperation between the Church and the government, the achievements in Jiangxi can serve as a model. Under the leadership of Zhang Fuliang, a director of the National Christian Council, Lichuan and ten other experimental districts have been organized and established one after another. The other ten districts are managed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, while Lichuan is independent. However, those who go to Lichuan say that its achievements are no different from those of the other ten districts. In fact, Lichuan and the other ten districts are all making efforts to revive under the same leadership with the Christian spirit of service. How can there be any difference to be found? What is more noteworthy is that when we work to revive the lives of farmers in Lichuan and the other ten districts, we have a special Christian spirit. Our aim is to find effective solutions so that those who work for the welfare of the people can adopt and follow them. The Church is even more enthusiastic about lending its talents to participate in this great work of rural revival. Because its scope is so broad, our efforts today are but a drop in the ocean. The rural areas of Jiangxi after the war are extremely desolate. If they can be given a new life, it will truly be the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven. In addition, what is sufficient to symbolize the cooperation between the Church and the government is the national health undertaking. The earliest established health organization in China was the Health Education Association, which has been carrying out its work under the management of Christianity for many years. Although the work of this organization has now been largely taken over by the government, there is much that the Church and church hospitals can contribute to the national health plan. It is said that the Christian Youth Association has a medical director who is dedicated to promoting this cooperation, which is what we are very pleased about. This spring, the Department of Health prepared 4,000 dozen cowpox vaccines for use in rural areas. It asked its medical advisor, Mrs. Mousse Boer, to request the assistance of the New Life Movement Association, which agreed with the New Life Movement in several provinces to obtain the cooperation of local church hospitals, schools, and rural churches to promote the four-village vaccination movement. At present, the health authorities have not been able to complete their health care institutions in remote areas, so the Church's supplementing their inadequacies is also a good opportunity to serve the people. Currently, a quarter of the vaccine has been received and distributed for use in various places. Through the cooperation of the Department of Health, the New Life Movement Association, and hospitals, schools, and churches, more than 60,000 people have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>A women's prayer meeting was recently established in Guangzhou, with a membership of over 1,000. Each member prays daily with her family for China and its leaders. This is a special way to express patriotism, and its effect is enough to cultivate a strong spiritual unity. The New Life Movement hopes that all churches in the country will have this kind of prayer organization.</p>
<p>Zhang Jia'ao, Minister of Railways, has specially built a train car called "New Life on Wheels" to travel to major and minor cities along various lines to promote the New Life Movement. The car is equipped with film equipment and other visual education materials, so that it can be used anywhere in streets, government offices, halls, or churches. I hope that the churches you preside over will cooperate with it when the car arrives. For details, please contact the General Association of the New Life Movement in Nanjing as soon as possible.</p>
<p>All this cooperation does not require profound doctrines or sacred inspiration. Even with China's original old morality, sacrificing oneself and loving others, we should actively participate. People call Christianity a representative of material civilization, which is indeed an accurate judgment. The persistence and happiness of modern life are all based on various scientific inventions, and Christian countries are the source of these inventions. Although ancient physics made considerable contributions in countries such as Greece, it was the unique contribution of Christian countries that developed and expanded it and made it a common enjoyment for mankind. The import of modern life into China today is very rapid, and the Chinese people accept this life without hesitation. The Apostle Paul gave a solemn meaning to the material life of mankind when he said, "Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit?" Then a happy material life should not be unique to a few, but should be shared by all. It is the inescapable responsibility of us Christians to spread this "New Life" among the people.</p>
<p>Wherever the Christian faith reaches, the status of women increases accordingly. Not long ago, church schools in the interior areas persuaded women to enroll and receive modern education, all free of charge, and even gave awards to encourage them. Their painstaking efforts are truly touching. Now these trained women are participating in various movements and improving the living conditions and status of their sisters in various provinces. Their faith formation has been concretized and manifested in action. May the New Life Movement and the Church also develop their spirit of cooperation in this area, seeking the improvement of the lives of women and children in villages and towns throughout the country. Knowing that the world's churches have abundant financial resources and many enthusiastic and capable young people, may we gather this financial and human resources and go together to meet the urgent needs of this era.</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui, Chairman of Jiangxi Province, is now promoting a large-scale movement to improve the lives of women and children throughout the province, under the guidance of Mrs. Zhu (daughter of Mr. Xiong Bing'er). The activities of this movement can mainly rely on the cooperation of the Church and various social movement organizations in the province. When Chairman Xiong was in Beiping last year, he asked several female professors from Yenching University to draft a plan to promote this movement, which is what he now calls the "triple cooperation plan." The so-called triple cooperation refers to: (1) cooperation with women with higher education, (2) cooperation with churches and social movement organizations that are already active in Jiangxi, and (3) cooperation with the Women's Committee of the New Life Movement Association. Therefore, Xiong has very high expectations for the Church's assistance in this struggle to increase the status of women and serve the country.</p>
<p>Commentators often believe that cooperation with the government rarely yields effective results. Even many of our countrymen hold this view. A certain important social service worker in a church in Nanchang was severely criticized by a colleague because of his long-term cooperation with the Women's New Life Movement Association in the province. However, we should know that cooperation and service after careful consideration will benefit all parties. The real benefit that the Church gains after participating in this movement is the increase in social knowledge and prosperity. For any society with increased knowledge and prosperity, the Church and the chapel will become indispensable institutions.</p>
<p>Previously, because of the urgent need for female talents with university education in the recovered bandit areas of Jiangxi, we asked Ginling Women's College to recommend candidates. Dr. Wu Yifang, President of the College (President of the Christian Council, who is also reading this article today), consulted with the faculty and staff of the College and selected several diligent and impartial graduates to go there. Now their service achievements have been praised by all there. Today we can tell you, "If Ginling recommends graduates to serve in rural areas, there is no need to investigate in depth, just send them immediately." Most of the schools run by Christianity have made significant contributions to promoting the New Life Movement among students, and their cost-saving management, excellent work achievements, and struggles in the environment of national crisis have all left a clear impression that is not easy to erase across the country. I hope that in education, we will not be complacent and become lazy, and we will not stop halfway. The Committee Chairman and I both believe that a rational life must have religious faith. Without religion, education is not complete. Today, all kinds of undertakings are in urgent need of leading talents, and they are in urgent need of talents with Christian service spirit and practical action.</p>
<p>The Young Men's and Women's Christian Associations are really at the forefront of leading talents. We have been subtly influenced by them for many years and deeply feel the need to change our way of life. The Young Men's and Women's Christian Associations have been very helpful in making young people yearn for the New Life.</p>
<p>We should know that Christ's emphasis on personality is not only in the realm of interest. He is deeply concerned about the welfare of society and cannot forget the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven. The so-called Kingdom of Heaven is where the righteousness and justice of all people are entrusted. The Chinese people have always valued personality. Their politeness and attention to "face" are often criticized by foreigners. Most of their lives are bound by habits and dominated by maintaining their bodies. If they can avoid it, they will never harm others. The ideal society we envision values "moderation," picking the middle ground over extremes. Therefore, a collectivist country is not what the Chinese people admire, because it annihilates the individual to enrich its country and tramples on personality to build its authority, which is not what the Chinese people like.</p>
<p>The New Life Movement resolutely rejects all forms of organization, because it runs counter to the late Premier's teachings and creates opportunities for those who harbor ulterior motives, disregard human rights, and take advantage of the situation to think of rebellion to oppress the people. The Chinese people have their own thoughts and will continue their intellectual activities. Only those who understand their culture, their justice, and feel their love for freedom can gain the cooperation of the Chinese people. There is a true meaning of new life in Chinese society, and what it needs is only guidance and religious faith. The foundation of the new China was built by its ancestors and cannot be replaced by various modern ideologies.</p>
<p>3.  The New Life Movement as a Call to Assist National Revival</p>
<p>The advancement of world events often gives people a sense of disappointment, but the Christian faith always gives us hope for national revival. The spirit of Christianity is neither a purely theological system of knowledge, nor what is generally called philosophy, but combines and broadens both, including the relationship between people and individual faith. Our responsibility today is to search for the points of contact between our faith and general life. The needs of the times are the guide for our vision.</p>
<p>Throughout history, God has always communicated with mankind through revelation and spiritual sensation, and through the mediation of his Holy Spirit, he has spiritual dialogue with us. When he speaks, we can perceive it, and reason and emotion can respond to it at the same time. Once we discover the need for revival and discover the tools to complete the grand revival, the trend of the times will be like the surging tide, and we will be carried away by it and cannot resist it. However, during its progress, we should understand the content of our work and gradually reach a state of thorough understanding.</p>
<p>Christ has two characteristics: his life is based on the common faith, and his faith has the power to move mountains. The future of building a new society is difficult and requires the assistance of these two characteristics. The New Life Movement requires us to practice the highest ideals of mankind, persevere in faith and move forward. Both individuals and society need active action, which is inherent in the Christian spirit.</p>
<p>In today's program, there is an item "The Church and its Relationship," and under this item, there is a sub-item of the New Life Movement, so I briefly describe my thoughts as my personal contribution to this issue.</p>
<p>Regarding the aforementioned section on national revival, I have a few more words to add. The changes in the lives of the Chinese people must be promoted in accordance with the steps prescribed by the late Premier, because the founder of the Republic of China was truly a perfect person with both faith and action. His soul burned with a passion to save the people from fire and water. He and our Lord were on different paths but had the same goal, which cannot be denied. Born of faith, died of faith, and now left this most important stage of completing the revolution to await our efforts. The most important thing in construction is the regeneration and improvement of the spiritual life of the people. The social life of the people has its own historical process of creation, which we cannot create, but we can improve it and infuse it with a new soul. The creation of Christian life is actually "a dramatic and permanent change in its spirit," which is generally called new life, "changing its principles of succession, changing its habits and state of life, and continuing its new type of life under the guidance of the Holy Spirit." This is the inner form of the New Life and the starting point of national revival. In a broad sense, this part of the construction is the work that the Church should undertake. May the New Life Movement and the Church cooperate to promote it.</p>

<h3>The Perpetrator of the Case of Japanese Ruffians Beating and Humiliating Customs Officers Apologized to the Customs Yesterday</h3>
<p>A local solution was unsuccessful, and the Customs has reported to the Central Government.</p>
<p>The Shishi News Agency reports that when the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru entered port on the evening of the 24th of last month, customs inspectors Cao Ketong and Shen Huiren of the Jianghai Customs were severely beaten by Japanese ruffians at the Huishan Wharf. Afterwards, Robert Ford, Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, immediately reported the incident to the Central Government and made representations to Yoshioka, the Acting Consul General of Japan in Shanghai. To date, the Japanese side has not yet responded. However, it is learned that the perpetrator, Shibata Kumeju, accompanied by personnel dispatched by the Japanese consulate, went to the Jianghai Customs yesterday afternoon and expressed his apologies to the beaten customs officers Cao and Shen in the office of Commissioner of Customs Robert Ford, in an attempt to resolve the case locally and to dismiss the five key points raised by the Customs. (Note: The five key points are 1. Stop illegal acts, 2. Punish the perpetrators, 3. Compensation, 4. Apology, and 5. Guarantee that the same incident will not occur again.) The Customs authorities have reported the circumstances to the Central Government and are awaiting instructions.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Development of Northern Shipping</h3>
<p>Unseen Since the September 18th Incident</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, Northern shipping was subjected to environmental pressures. Chinese merchant ships declined to the extreme. Illegal inspections and tonnage taxes in Yingkou, Andong, and other places made it impossible for Chinese ships to bear the exploitation, and they stopped sailing one after another, changing routes to various ports in the North. As a result, the number of ships in Tianjin, Yantai, Longkou, Qingdao, and other ports suddenly increased. However, most of the markets in the North were occupied by Japanese goods. Our country's goods were invisibly driven out, which affected shipping. Chinese shipping companies operating in the North were greatly impacted. Then, due to the proliferation of smuggled goods, some Chinese merchant ships stopped sailing due to losses, and some sold their ships and stopped operating. Until our country strictly cracked down on smuggling and sent warships to patrol the sea, the trend of smuggling gradually subsided. It was not until the second half of last year that the situation improved slightly, and domestic goods gradually began to be transported. This year, starting in April, the shipping situation in Shanghai changed. There were many goods in storage in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which led to stable transportation in recent times. The freight volume along the coast of the North has also suddenly increased. The congestion of goods going from Shanghai is not only rare since the September 18th Incident, but also only seen in the past ten years. Cotton yarn, cloth, silk, rice, flour, cigarettes, and domestic miscellaneous goods, hardware, electrical materials, etc., are all being shipped in large quantities, one after another. Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, Osaka, Zhengji, China Merchants, Zhaoxing, and other shipping companies have sent large numbers of ships to sail. There are so many ships and goods that some cannot even secure the tonnage they need. As a result, passengers have situations of "competing for tonnage" and "scrambling for loading." The so-called "competing for tonnage" refers to, after buying the bill of lading, changing the number of goods by themselves, for example, changing 100 pieces of covers to 600 or 700 pieces. If the Customs finds out, they must be fined, so the passengers voluntarily pay the fine. "Scrambling for loading" refers to colluding with the dock foremen to try to get the goods unloaded first. Therefore, every ship going to Yantai and Tianjin is fully loaded. According to shipping companies, after the increase in freight rates in May, compared with three years ago, the freight income can be increased up to four times. Such development is truly rare. There are still many goods accumulated in Shanghai, especially rice and wheat flour, no less than 70,000 to 80,000 tons. All companies are adding large-tonnage temporary liners in addition to the regular sailings to sail the Northern route, competing to load goods to meet the needs of passengers.</p>
<h3>Alarming Development of Shanghai-Hong Kong Shipping</h3>
<p>Japanese and North China-bound Ships Sailing South are Fully Loaded with Shanghai Goods and Cannot Load More</p>
<p>The Xinxin News Agency reports that, according to the latest North China Daily News, major mail ship companies operating between Hong Kong and overseas, in view of the recent booming transportation, held a meeting with various companies operating coastal shipping. All agreed that freight rates on other lines had already increased, so it was decided to increase freight rates between Hong Kong and Shanghai by 20%. According to this decision, the meeting implemented the current coastal freight rates accordingly. The reason for the increase is based on the booming trade around the world, the general increase in freight rates, and the consistent rise in various other rates. In the local area, because the tonnage for the transportation of rice and scrap metal often falls short of actual needs, there has also been a further increase in business. Taking scrap metal as an example, the freight rate from Hong Kong to Japan has increased from 8 yuan to 10 yuan. It has been learned that the general situation of the recent increase in freight rates from Hong Kong and other places is as follows: 10% increase to Japan, the Hong Kong Strait Colonies, and Calcutta, India, effective March 28; 15% increase from Hong Kong to Manila, effective March 1; 20% increase from Hong Kong to Australia, effective May 1; 15% increase from Hong Kong to Pacific ports, effective May 1; 33.3% (one third) increase from Hong Kong to the Strait Colonies for Chinese goods, effective December 1, 1936; 20% (one fifth) increase for foreign goods, effective March 1 of this year; 10% increase from Hong Kong to Calcutta, Madras, and Yangon, effective March 1; 20% increase from Hong Kong to Japan, effective March 1; 20% increase from Hong Kong to Shanghai, effective April 15. In addition, ships sailing south from Japan and North China passing through Hong Kong load their cargo holds as fully as possible, so that shippers in this port cannot load more goods, resulting in a standstill. In addition, those who make advance reservations cannot guarantee the required space, because in fact, when ships set sail from Japan and other ports in North China, they are loaded to full capacity, and cannot be reloaded after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Tea Party at the Income Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>Representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Others Invited</p>
<p>Our newspaper reports: The Municipal Income Tax Bureau held a tea party at its office at 4:00 PM yesterday, inviting the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, representatives from various exchanges, and brokers. Over twenty people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Mu Ouchu, Zhang Weiru, Gu Xinyi, Xu Yongzuo, Jin Runxiang, and Yan Esheng. Mr. Liang Hejun presided over the meeting. Regarding the issue of withholding income tax for exchange clients, the brokers had previously submitted the tax payments, but there were some questions about the calculation procedures, so the forms had not yet been submitted. After sincere discussions between Mr. Liang and representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and the exchanges, most of the issues were resolved, and it was agreed that the payments would be fully reported and submitted between the 10th and 15th of this month. During the tea party, Wang, Mu, Gu, Xu, and others spoke successively. The event lasted two hours and ended on a joyful note.</p>
<h3>Brief Shipping Report</h3>
<p>New Rules for Cargo Handling</p>
<p>Since the reorganization and reform of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianghai (Yangtze River and coastal) lines, the comprador system has been abolished and replaced with a purser system. The original cargo handling personnel, who were previously employed by the compradors, are now directly employed by the company. (The company has specially formulated new rules to ensure the safety of cargo transportation and to ensure that cargo handlers are responsible. All Jianghai vessels are divided into two grades, A and B. Grade A cargo handlers must pay a credit guarantee of 10,000 yuan and a cash deposit of 5,000 yuan. Grade B cargo handlers must pay a credit guarantee of 6,000 yuan and a cash deposit of 3,000 yuan. The company has ordered all cargo handlers to pay these amounts as soon as possible, but the cargo handlers on each ship do not have the financial means to do so and have not yet paid.)</p>
<p>Baofeng Runs Aground</p>
<p>The Baofeng, a ship belonging to the Nanshi Julun Company, which operates on the Shanghai-Chongming-Qidong route, ran aground on the 3rd of this month. At 9:00 AM, while sailing opposite Baoshan, fog rolled in, obscuring the waterway. The ship mistakenly sailed into shallow water and ran aground. At that time, the ship was heavily laden with cargo and passengers, causing the hull to sink further into the sand and preventing it from being freed. After a day and a night, at 4:00 AM on the 4th, during the high tide, the ship took the opportunity to reverse at high speed and was able to escape danger. After leaving the shallows, it was discovered that the grounding had damaged the ship below the waterline, making immediate inspection impossible. Yesterday, the ship returned to Shanghai. The company immediately reported the incident to the Maritime Administration and the United Ship Insurance Association, who dispatched surveyors to inspect the ship.</p>
<p>Zhenyuan Collides with a Ship</p>
<p>A telegram arrived in Shanghai yesterday from the Yongyuan Shipping Company's Zhenyuan ship, stating that it had departed from Tianjin on the 5th, bound for Yingkou. While exiting near the Dagu estuary, it encountered a sailboat entering the port. At the time, the tide was receding, and the current was strong, causing the Zhenyuan to collide with the sailboat. The sailboat was damaged. Due to the receding tide, the Zhenyuan was unable to stop and proceeded out to sea. However, the Tianjin company was instructed to inspect the damaged sailboat first and then negotiate.</p>
<h3>Request to Change the Zhujia Gou Dredging Plan</h3>
<p>Request Submitted Through the Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Tao Qinwen, a standing committee member of the 12th branch of the 5th district of the Lixing area of Pudong, submitted a request to higher authorities through the Municipal Party Headquarters, asking the Municipal Government to change the dredging plan for the Zhujia Gou canal and Zhen River because it affects residential houses. The request was submitted to the 5th district party headquarters the other day, stating: Dredging the Zhujia Gou canal will affect residential houses. Please submit this request to the Municipal Party Headquarters, which will then request the Municipal Government to change the course of the river to facilitate water transport and avoid demolishing houses. Investigations reveal that dredging the Zhujia Gou canal and Zhen River will indeed have a significant impact on residential houses. Previously, comrades from our branch and local residents jointly submitted a request to the Municipal Government, asking it to send personnel to conduct an on-site survey to avoid dredging the Zhen River. Subsequently, the Municipal Government sent personnel to conduct a survey and issued instructions stating that "Since the East and West Zhujia Gou canals will be dredged, the Zhen River must also be dredged simultaneously to be effective. The residents should build the retaining walls on both sides, but since the residents are unable to bear the cost, the government will find another way to fund it to show its compassion. If the canal is dredged to the Xiaoluo on the south bank, the Bureau of Public Works should build a new road to avoid disrupting traffic!" After receiving the order, comrades, for the sake of their family and property, continued to ask the Municipal Government to consider the plight of the people and exempt the Zhen River section from further construction, and requested a change of plan to bypass the Zhenbei Yaogou Yangshu Gou areas and proceed with the plan. Subsequently, the Municipal Government issued Decree No. 33 rejecting the request. We are extremely dismayed. Our comrades' request to the Municipal Government to bypass and dredge the river is the consensus of the local people. Therefore, the funds required to purchase six mu of farmland for the bypass, the people are willing to raise, and build another retaining wall, the Municipal Government will spend a great deal. If this amount is used for bypassing and dredging the river, it will avoid demolition of houses, and water transportation will also be facilitated. The people are optimistic about its success. Therefore, we dare to submit this request, asking you to forward it to the Municipal Party Headquarters, which will then request the Municipal Government to understand public opinion and approve our request. It is for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Committee of the 5th District Party Headquarters. Subsequently, the Party Headquarters issued an order stating that the petition has been forwarded to the Municipal Executive Committee for review. Please be informed of this order.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in the Extra-Settlement Road Area Refuse to Pay Rent, Reaching 3 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Translated from the English Da Mei Evening News by a Foreign News Agency: The economic struggle between Chinese and Japanese residents in Hongkou is quite serious. Since the Shanghai Incident of 1932, Japanese residents and merchants have refused to pay rent and property taxes, and they deny that they are in arrears. Since Chinese people know that there is no legal recourse, they no longer pursue such matters. However, foreign landlords, because they employ Japanese legal experts and have the assistance of the consular and party authorities, do not suffer such losses. Might makes right. This is not only seen in the Hongkou housing issue, but such situations are too numerous to count. For example, there is a famous landlord who owned a large amount of property before the Shanghai Incident. After the war, due to the impact of this rent refusal, he gradually sold off his properties and now only has twenty or so left. However, even collecting rent for these twenty or so buildings is very difficult. A few weeks ago, a certain Japanese man owed rent for a total of twenty-four months. The lawsuit filed with the Japanese Public Hall resulted in a judgment that he had to pay one-fourth of the full amount first, but in the end, he was allowed to move out without paying a penny. In the past two years, the landlord had even paid for his water and other expenses. There are also unscrupulous Chinese people who act as accomplices to the Japanese, so there is suspicion about renting to Chinese people who come to rent. The Continental Bank has about 200 houses in Hongkou. Half of the tenants are Japanese, and more than one-third owe rent for February to June. For example, the bank has a total of 165 houses on Scott Road and 61 houses in Continental New Village, of which 15 are rented to Japanese tenants, owing a total of 3,200 yuan in rent. There are 43 houses in Liuqing Xiaozhu, of which 14 are rented to Japanese tenants, each owing an average of 300 yuan. There are 57 houses in Songwei Fang, most of which are rented to Japanese tenants, owing a total of 1,500 yuan for 30 months. From these examples, one can imagine the general situation. Shanghai Yeguang Real Estate Company is run by the British and has a total of 500 houses in Hongkou. Except for a small number of tenants who are in arrears due to financial difficulties, there are no other losses. Furthermore, sub-landlords also suffer significant losses. They are unable to seek legal recourse and cannot afford to pay the rent, so their plight is imaginable. Our reporter immediately went to North Sichuan Road to investigate the situation. According to a Cantonese sub-landlord, he had leased a room for 8 yuan per month to a Japanese person, but after three months, he only received 8 yuan. After repeated arguments, the tenant finally moved out. In addition to generating resentment, the sub-landlord also had to pay for the moving expenses. What is even more difficult is that after subletting, some Japanese and Korean thugs use the premises to traffic drugs, so some would rather leave the premises vacant than take such a great risk. This situation only occurs in the Hongkou area. According to a real estate merchant, Japanese residents in other areas pay rent and abide by the law, just like other foreigners.</p>
<h3>Japanese Female Reporter Ms. Ishiwara Kiyoko Invited Women's Circles to a Forum Yesterday</h3>
<p>Over Sixty People Attended, Including Lu Lihua. A Joint Farewell Banquet Will be Held for the Women's Circles Tonight</p>
<p>Ms. Ishiwara Kiyoko, a reporter for the Japanese Toyo Keizai Shinpo and a commentator for the women's column of the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun, came to China this time to observe and investigate the national conditions and the trends of the women's movement in our country. After arriving in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday, she believed that Shanghai was the economic, political, and cultural center of our country. In order to gain a deeper understanding, she specially invited leaders of women's circles in this city to hold a forum at the 9th floor of the YMCA on Baixianqiao at 4:00 PM yesterday. Over sixty people attended, including Lu Lihua, the principal of Liangjiang School, Lin Kecong of the Women's Association, Jin Guangmei of the Women's Progressive Association, and Yan Zhenwang, Shen Ziji, Wang Ruqi, Jiang Huiruo, Wu Deyi, Ling Jixi, Jiang Ping, Huang Biyao, Jin Bingying, Jiang Yixiao, Liang Guang, and female reporter Tani Yoko of the Mainichi Shimbun, and Ms. Mishima, a reporter for the Shanghai Daily. During the meeting, they reported, instructed, and elaborated in detail on the past history and future trends of the women's movement in the two countries. Cui Wanqiu and Lai Guifu served as translators. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ishiwara's Speech</p>
<p>After the seating, Lai Guifu introduced Ms. Ishiwara Kiyoko's resume. Ms. Ishiwara stood up and gave a speech, saying that she invited leaders of women's circles to hold a forum in Shanghai today to strengthen ties. She was very happy and honored that everyone had come. She regretted that she did not know Chinese and could not fully chat with everyone. However, the connection between people's feelings lies in mutual understanding, so the lack of language should not hinder our friendship. She had been in China since the beginning of last month, traveling to Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, and other places. What she had seen and heard made her feel that the rapid progress of various undertakings in your country and the true face of your country were very different from what she had read in newspapers at home. What was especially enviable was that women in your country had already occupied a considerable position in politics, and the women's movement was booming and had a bright future. However, thinking of the women in her country who are still under the oppression of male power and have no equality or freedom, she felt ashamed. In the future, she hoped that we could eliminate boundaries, join hands to fight for equal rights for men and women, and exert our remaining strength to assist in promoting national political and educational construction to fulfill our national duties and not fail this life. Today, she had prepared a simple banquet and hoped that the sisters would not abandon it and give her advice. She was endlessly grateful.</p>
<p>Lu Lihua's Speech</p>
<p>Lu Lihua then stood up and said that she was deeply sorry that Ms. Ishiwara had come to our country, and we were not involved in the matter, so we did not have enough time to prepare for the reception. Now, we are even more grateful and ashamed to have been invited by Ms. Ishiwara to a grand meeting. Ms. Ishiwara is a leading expert in the study of politics and economics in the Japanese women's circle. From the experience of this women's circle, she will be able to use her extraordinary insights to promote the harmony of national conditions between the two countries. I have two major hopes for Ms. Ishiwara. As Ms. Ishiwara said, she has a deep understanding of our country in this month of on-site observation, and she feels that the reports and rumors in Japan are not entirely accurate. In fact, we also know that the misrepresentation of our neighboring country's newspapers has caused various adverse international impressions. We hope that Ms. Ishiwara will introduce what she actually observed to the people of your country to verify the truth after returning home. She recalled that in the 20th year of the Republic of China, she once traveled to Japan to participate in the Tokyo Women's Association. The chairman and others talked about the close geographical proximity between our country and your country, which is no different from brothers and sisters, lips and teeth are interdependent, and we are concerned about each other. In the past, due to the many interferences in the political situation between the two countries, we have not been able to achieve coordination, and the losses are self-evident. Therefore, she tried her best to advocate that women in the two countries should rise up to assist the government, connect with each other, coexist and prosper. She hoped that Ms. Ishiwara would awaken the national female compatriots after returning home and shoulder this arduous task together. Finally, Ms. Huang Biyao, Ms. Wang Ruqi, Ms. Kōno Eiko, and Ms. Mishima successively expressed their opinions on the trends of the women's movement in the two countries, and they elaborated on many points. The atmosphere in the whole hall was extremely harmonious, and the meeting did not end until about 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Tonight's Banquet</p>
<p>It is learned that Ms. Ishiwara will leave Shanghai for her home country on the 13th. The women's circles in this city are scheduled to hold a joint banquet at the Dadong Restaurant at 6:00 PM tonight to show their gratitude and do their best as hosts.</p>
<h3>Zhu Xuefan Broadcasts in Washington</h3>
<p>The Textile Conference Achieved Significant Results. I Hope That China and the United States Can Know and Understand Each Other</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Xuefan, the Chinese labor representative attending the 23rd International Labor Conference and the World Textile Conference, broadcasted a speech at the National Broadcasting Company in Washington after the World Textile Conference. The text of his speech is recorded below: Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. I am honored to have the opportunity to represent Chinese workers at the World Textile Conference, and therefore I am able to visit your country and admire your magnificent capital. I would like to extend the warm greetings of Chinese workers to you. I have only been here for a few days, but I already feel very comfortable. I am very grateful for the courteous reception of the people and government of your country. I attended this conference in the hope that the conference would have an effective measure to establish the foundation of international cooperation, social justice, and world peace. Millions of my fellow workers are looking forward to me bringing back some good results from this conference. Judging from the results of our conference, I will not be going back empty-handed. At present, Chinese workers may not have the same good living conditions as American workers, but we have our inherent characteristics. For example, Chinese workers are poor, but they are hardworking, honest, and reliable. People outside of China will not understand their true situation, but they will soon be understood in the United States. Since I arrived in your country, I am very happy to note that the American people have a deep concern for our country and our people. As your able President said to the conference delegates at the White House last Thursday, we should all study each other more so that we can understand each other more deeply. The Chinese people have always admired your country and your people. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, we have always maintained a cooperative and harmonious relationship. This is a sentence that I am very pleased to say. I would like to take this opportunity to hope that the people of the two countries will study each other more so that they can understand each other more deeply and be more friendly. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to you.</p>
<h3>Mayor Yu Also Serves Concurrently as the Director of the Municipal Martial Arts Hall</h3>
<p>Since the former Mayor Wu Tiecheng was transferred to Guangdong, the position of Director of the Municipal Martial Arts Hall, which is held concurrently by the Mayor, cannot be vacant. It is because promoting martial arts and managing the affairs of the hall depend on the leadership and guidance of the Director. It is learned that the hall, following the precedent of previous Mayors serving concurrently as Director, has submitted a request to Mayor Yu for approval to serve concurrently as Director. The future of martial arts in this city will definitely have new facilities.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Postpones Discussion on the Extra-Settlement Road Issue</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Public Works Department originally planned to continue discussing the extra-settlement road issue at the meeting on the 6th of this month. However, the memorandum submitted by the Japanese Consul General to the Director of the Public Works Department has just been received by Mayor Yu. Mayor Yu has not yet expressed his opinion on the memorandum, so it has been decided to postpone the discussion on the extra-settlement road issue.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Bao Gang Will Go Abroad</h3>
<p>Lawyer Bao Gang graduated from the Law Department of Shanghai Chizhi University and has been practicing law for many years. Mr. Bao has decided to give up his law practice in order to pursue further studies. He is scheduled to take the Japanese Queen Maru at the end of this month to Japan to take the entrance examination for the Diplomacy Department of the graduate school of the most famous university in Japan. He will study international public law and other subjects for about two years. In the future, when he completes his studies, he will definitely make contributions to the country and society.</p>
<h3>Xi Lanqing's Concubine is Accused of Fraud and Turns Herself in to the Police</h3>
<p>Denies Occupation of Shanghai Gas Stock</p>
<p>Xi Lanqing of Pudong has a considerable fortune and owns property in Hangzhou and Shanghai. He died of old age and illness in January of this year. His concubine, Zhou Huilin, recently instructed Fu Jiafu (also known as Minzhai), Hu Shulin, Peng Ren, and others to transfer 770 shares of Xi's Shanghai Gas Company stock to her name. Xi's children believed that this was embezzlement, so they reported it to the Zhabei Police Station, ordering the detectives to arrest Hu Shulin and Peng Ren first. They were transferred to the First Special Court, which approved bail and adjourned the hearing. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. At 6:00 AM yesterday, Zhou Huilin and Fu Minzhai suddenly turned themselves in to the Zhabei Police Station, accompanied by lawyers Jiang Yiping and Yu Xiangqin. After a brief interrogation by detectives Pang Ruiqing and Wang Shusen, they were detained. At 9:00 AM, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Judge Feng Shide presided over the hearing. First, police lawyer Wang Yaotang presented the case, prosecuting Zhou Huilin on charges of fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law and requesting that the case be heard together with Hu Shulin and others. Zhou Huilin testified that she and Xi Lanqing were formally married and had held a wedding ceremony, not a concubine. Lanqing was old and sick, so he often lived with me and I took care of him. I could not leave him. The shares of the Gas Company were given to me by Xi, so the transfer application was also signed by him in person. I did not know English, so I entrusted Fu Minzhai and Hu Shulin to contact the Gas Company. Peng Ren is a friend of Hu. The woman's lawyers, Jiang Yiping and Yu Xiangqin, immediately said that the defendant, Zhou Huilin, had just arrived in Shanghai today and turned herself in to the police station. She intended to write a detailed plea, detailing the process for the court's reference, but she suffered from severe stomach problems. Fu Jiafu went to Shaoxing to collect accounts and rushed to report the case with Zhou when he heard the news, so she requested permission to post bail. Judge Feng approved the application after verification and ordered that the case be heard with Hu Shulin and others at a later date. Zhou and Fu were allowed to post bail of 8,000 yuan each. Before finding bail, their defense lawyers were temporarily responsible for their release.</p>
<h3>National Coal Production and Sales Association Asks National Goods Association to Jointly Promote National Coal</h3>
<p>Heartbroken by the Concession of the Liujiang Coal Mine</p>
<p>Xin Xin She reported: The China National Coal Production and Sales Joint Association sent a letter to the Shanghai China National Goods Maintenance Association, stating: Recently, we read in the newspaper that the Manufacturers Association sent a letter to the Coal Industry Joint Association regarding the Liujiang Coal Mine Company transferring all property rights to the Thai Kee Company. This matter is very important to the rights of our industry. This kind of strange shame and great insult should be jointly responsible by the people to recover the rights and interests. We respectfully request your association to forward a letter to the relevant coal industry groups to unanimously find ways to strictly prevent it, and on the other hand, organize a national coal relief cooperative to maintain the sales of national coal. Now, we will attach a map of the investigation results of our association and the situation of each coal mine area in Linyu County, Hebei, for your reference. Although the Liujiang Coal Mine Company has been occupied, there is still the Linyu Baoxing Coal Mine, which can be adopted by colleagues. We hope that you will vigorously promote the adoption of domestic Linyu Baoxing coal and other coal, and quickly establish a national coal relief cooperative to maintain the national system. This is our best prayer.</p>

<h3>Private Power Industry Association Continues to Hold Diesel User Meeting</h3>
<p>Name Changed and Articles of Association Adopted</p>
<p>The National Private Power Industry Federation, because of the continued increase in the price of diesel and because the local managers of the Mobil and Asiatic oil companies often fail to supply the contracted amount, the technical committee of the association, Shen Sifang, etc., in accordance with the resolutions of the annual meeting, initiated and convened various colleagues who use diesel as fuel to hold a meeting to discuss countermeasures, and at the same time prepare to organize consumer cooperation organizations to seek relief. All the attending members unanimously decided to first establish a preparatory committee, publicly electing Shen Sifang and Tang Chengxin as the chief and deputy directors of the preparatory committee, and also appointing representatives Shen Sifang, Yu Qihan, Wu Shuying, Han Yimin, and Tang Chengxin to immediately negotiate with Mobil. It has been heard that Mobil and other companies have indeed expressed substantial concessions, but the association is not satisfied with the various preferential measures it has won, so yesterday (6th) at 2:00 PM, it continued to hold a general meeting at Yijia Chun to determine the final policy. Over sixty people attended, including various initiators and members such as Shen Sifang. First, Chairman Shen Sifang reported on the significance of the establishment of the association and the progress of the preparations, and said that since diesel is a necessary fuel for each power plant, the diesel problem should be given extreme importance. It is of great significance to jointly initiate and organize this association today. Since all parties have already established close ties, they can cooperate fully in the future and will not be afraid of any difficulties. Next, Yu Qihan and Huang Youlan expressed their opinions successively, and Yu Qihan proposed that the preparatory committee be canceled and renamed the Fuel Committee of the National Private Power Industry Federation. The resolution was passed, and the draft articles of association were formulated as follows: Article 1: This association is named the Fuel Committee of the National Private Power Industry Federation, and the association is located in Shanghai. Article 2: The purpose of this association is to protect the interests of diesel users. Article 3: All colleagues who join the Private Power Industry Federation can be members of this association. Article 4: The affairs of this association are governed by a committee system. Article 5: This association holds a general meeting once a year to elect nine committee members (three alternate committee members) to form a committee, and their term of office is one year. The committee implements the tasks stipulated in Article 2 of these Articles of Association and is responsible for the safekeeping and allocation of the association's funds. Article 6: This association has one chairman and one secretary-general, who are elected and appointed by the committee at the annual meeting, and their term of office is one year, and they can be re-elected. Their powers are stipulated in the outline of business. Article 7: The expenses of this association are borne by the members. Article 8: This association has investigation, research, consultation, and negotiation departments. After the discussion was completed, it was decided to send Tang Chengxin to Mobil to express oral gratitude. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Unsuccessful Kidnapping of Cao Qiming by Bandits, Chinese Constable Han Juncai Dies in the Line of Duty</h3>
<p>Traffic Disrupted in Tangjiawan to Search for Bandits, but No Trace Found; Four People Wounded by Stray Bullets as Bandits Open Fire Along the Way</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 9:00 AM, a major incident of attempted kidnapping and resistance to arrest occurred at the Tangjiawan entrance on Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession. A Chinese constable died in the line of duty, killed instantly, and three men and women were wounded by stray bullets. The four bandits escaped without a trace amidst the chaos. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Background of the Victim</p>
<p>Cao Qiming, a local businessman, is currently 58 years old. He initially made his fortune in the shipping industry and later established the Baofeng Cotton Yarn Company at No. 51, Lane 2, Jiangxi Road, serving as its general manager. He resides in a self-built mansion, Song Lu, at No. 58, Lane 16 (Xianchengfang), Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession. The magnificent structure on Caohijing Road in western Shanghai is also Cao's self-built Cao Clan Ancestral Hall.</p>
<p>The Four Bandits</p>
<p>Although Cao is nearing sixty, he is quite frugal, disciplined, and diligent in his duties. Every morning, he arrives at his office no later than 9:30 AM. Yesterday morning, after the bell had rung nine times, he had a light breakfast and walked out of the lane with a friend, intending to board his private car (Concession No. 591). The driver, Cao Renfu (21 years old, local), was reaching out to open the car door when four bandits, two in long gowns and two in short attire, suddenly leaped out from the roadside, each with a pistol, and surrounded the car.</p>
<p>Chinese Constable Rushes to the Rescue</p>
<p>The driver, upon seeing this, was stunned. Cao turned ashen. At this critical moment, a passerby behind them saw what was happening and shouted, "Robbers!" At that moment, Chinese Constable Han Juncai, Badge No. 611, who was on duty in that section, heard the alarm and rushed from the west. He caught sight of Cao being besieged by the bandits and was about to bravely step forward to rescue him when the four bandits, aiming to preempt any action, swiftly dodged to the side of the car and opened fire at the constable. The constable quickly fired eight shots in return, but none hit their mark.</p>
<p>Death in the Line of Duty</p>
<p>The constable, with no cover, was struck by three bullets, one of which hit his chest, causing him to collapse and fall in front of the Shuifeng Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 14, Lane Entrance. According to eyewitnesses, after falling to the ground, the constable struggled to pursue the bandits, but because the bullet had hit a vital spot, he died instantly. He was indeed courageous. In that instant, Cao managed to turn around and flee back into the lane, thus avoiding the fate of becoming a hostage. Compared to the constable, he was fortunate and unfortunate.</p>
<p>Search Yields Nothing</p>
<p>The bandits fired wildly, and pedestrians fled in all directions. The four bandits took advantage of the chaos and disappeared into the crowd. When the French police arrived, they immediately dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and foreign detectives. However, the bandits were gone. The police chief ordered the temporary closure of traffic from the iron gate of the Tangjiawan small vegetable market in the west to Caishi Road in the east for a thorough search, but to no avail. At the same time, the Western Branch of the Chinese-administered area also dispatched a large number of patrolmen to assist in checking pedestrians, but no one was found.</p>
<p>The Deceased's Loyalty and Bravery</p>
<p>The police chief first had the body of the deceased Chinese Constable Han Juncai taken to the autopsy room attached to the Public Works Department Hospital on Route Tenant de la Tour for a coroner's examination. Constable Han was from Hebei and was only 29 years old. He had been working since January of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], completing six years of service. He had a wife, Zhang, who was 22 years old, and a two-year-old son. Constable Han was loyal to his duties and was praised by the authorities. His funeral was exceptionally somber. The police department has decided to provide generous compensation, and it is reported that Cao Qiming, deeply moved by the constable's spirit of sacrificing himself to save him, has also decided to provide generous compensation to comfort the loyal spirit.</p>
<p>Stray Bullets Injure People</p>
<p>As the bandits opened fire and fled, several people were injured by stray bullets near the Tangjiawan small vegetable market, which was bustling with activity. The injured included Li Qizi (16 years old, from Jiangbei), who was wounded in the thigh; Wang Xilin (25 years old, local hairdresser working at Youfang Hair Salon on Songjiang Road), who was wounded in the calf; Wang Jinlin, a worker at Shouji Hair Salon on Rue du Père Robert, was also injured; and Zhou Chengshi, the wife of French police detective Zhou Bingcheng, who was wounded in the thigh while returning home from buying vegetables near the Renshouli entrance. The police department sent her to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Prior Extortion</p>
<p>According to the victim's family, they had received two threatening letters from bandits a month ago. The first letter demanded $50,000, and the second increased the amount to $70,000, asking them to meet on Zhongshan Road. The Cao family sent someone to Zhongshan Road, but the bandits did not send anyone to negotiate. Subsequently, in order to prevent any unforeseen circumstances, the Cao family reported the matter to the French police, asking them to pay attention. Unexpectedly, this unfortunate incident occurred. It remains doubtful whether the letters were related to the bandits today.</p>
<h3>Two Bandits Sentenced in Extortion Case</h3>
<p>Yu Lianwen Sentenced to Two and a Half Years; Wang Huairong Sentenced to One Year</p>
<p>Yu Lianwen from Nanjing and Wang Huairong from Tongzhou, between January 26 and April 7 of this year, wrote a total of three threatening letters and delivered them to Tang Guonian, an employee of Ruichang Hardware Store at No. 41, Route Tenant de la Tour. They claimed to be subordinates of Zhang Kun, the deputy battalion commander of the Central Soviet Red Army, planning to establish an army school and raise $50,000. They enclosed two blank sheets of paper, instructing him to write "agree" or "disagree" and post them at the lane entrance. Initially, he ignored them, but then he received another letter, inquiring and requesting him to send a representative with a roll of plum-colored paper as a sign to meet at the corner of Qimei Road and Huangxing Road in Zhabei. When he went to observe the situation, no one came to negotiate. Subsequently, Huide Detective Liu Decheng, Detectives Qiu Zhenting, Xu Shutian, and Li Zhaokang from the Huishan Police Station saw Yu and Wang at the Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant at No. 405, Pingliang Road, making a phone call to Tang Guonian to urge payment. They were arrested together and taken to the First Special District Court for interrogation, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that during the adjournment, it was discovered that the two defendants, along with Zhang Asi and Cai Wenhui, who had fled, had sent three threatening letters to Zhang Kaiyuan (an employee of Shunjinlong Foreign Firm at No. 150, Jiujiang Road), a Ningbo native at No. 8, Lane 159, Pingliang Road, between March 25 and April 1. The letters, written on behalf of the Youth League in an excited tone, stated, "If you don't give us this $5,000, you will lose both your money and your life, and you will regret it." They requested him to send a representative to negotiate near Qimei Road and Huangxing Road in Zhabei. At the appointed time, Zhang sent his friend Liu Jinfu to meet, but no one came. Fearing arrest, he presented the letters for investigation. Liu Jinfu testified that he had gone to observe, but they dared not meet him. Today, Zhang Kaiyuan is unwell and cannot come to court to testify. When questioned, Yu Lianwen confessed that Zhang Asi and Cai Wenhui had instigated the matter and admitted to only writing one letter. The rest of his testimony was evasive. Wang Huairong confessed that his statement at the police station about dividing the $5,000 among the four was false. He said that he was ultimately deceived in this matter and asked for leniency. Judge Xiao sentenced Yu Lianwen to two and a half years of imprisonment and Wang Huairong to one year. The threatening letters were confiscated.</p>

<h3>Trafficker Chen Yusheng and Wife Deceive Seventeen Young Girls</h3>
<p>Using the Guise of Recruiting Female Workers for Cotton Mills, Planning to Take Them to Other Ports on Japanese Ships</p>
<p>The Fourth Detective Squad of the Municipal Police Bureau recently received a report from Yin Lianchun (53 years old) from Taixing, stating that his fellow villager, Chen Yusheng (37 years old), had sent his wife, Yang (23 years old), back to their village at the beginning of last month, claiming to recruit female workers for a cotton mill in Shanghai. Seventeen young girls, including Wu Xiaomei (17 years old), Bu Xiaonv (17), Chen Xier (16), Tang Linshi (19), Luo Xiaomei (21), Yang Xiaomei (19), Chen Fengying (24), Zhang Fengzhen (18), Wang Xiaomei (17), Wu Zhuwu (16), Qian Yumei (16), and Chen Xiaomei (17), Yin Shouzhen (15), Zhang Laoer (18), Zhang Aer (18), Chen Tongnu (17), Chen Houying (17) introduced by Yin, followed Yang to Shanghai and stayed at No. 55, Toyota Cotton Mill Dormitory in western Shanghai. On the 2nd of this month, Chen Yusheng, along with Wang Qingpei (24 years old, from Anhui, residing at No. 928, Puyili, Tokyo Road), his wife Yang, their children, and the seventeen young girls from Taixing, went to the Gongping Hostel on Gongping Road in Hongkou, where they rented rooms No. 123. They planned to take them on a Japanese ship to other ports to sell them. On the evening of the 3rd, Yin received a telegram from his daughter, Yin Jianmao (17 years old, currently a worker at the Japanese-owned Toyota Cotton Mill), reporting the details. He came to Shanghai to investigate. Upon receiving the report, the squad leader, Zhang Zhongde, immediately dispatched team leader Tang Bingxiang, detectives Han Yushan, Zhao Renxin, Liang Jianwu, Zhao Jinhui, Li Xinheng, and others, along with the Tilanqiao Police Station, to the Gongping Hostel. They arrested Chen Yusheng and his wife, Wang Qingpei, Chen's two sons and two daughters, and the seventeen young girls. They were all taken to the headquarters for interrogation.

<h3>High Price of Foreign Wheat Raises Costs, Many Flour Mills Suspend Operations or Reduce Working Hours</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, flour mills in various regions are ordering foreign wheat to make up for the shortage of domestic wheat production. Currently, foreign wheat is also in short supply in overseas markets due to scarcity, leading to price increases and increased costs. They have stopped ordering. The various factories face raw material difficulties and are successively suspending operations or reducing working hours. Dagong News Agency reporters investigated the situation as follows:</p>
<p>High Cost of Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>Countries such as Canada, Chicago, and Australia are well-known wheat-producing areas in the world. Their annual production accounts for more than 90% of the world's total. However, last year, due to weather conditions, wheat production was scarce and the harvest was drastically reduced. Demand exceeded supply, and the market lacked raw materials. As a result, market prices increased, with a difference of 20-30% compared to Chinese wheat. There are very few spot goods traded in the market. If foreign wheat is ordered, the delivery date is also not fixed. This also shows a glimpse of the supply of foreign wheat.</p>
<p>Suspension of Operations and Reduction of Working Hours</p>
<p>Flour mills in Shanghai, such as Fuxin, Fufeng, and Zhongda, as well as factories in Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Nanjing, Zhengzhou, Luonan, and other inland areas, collected funds to order more than 60,000 bags of foreign wheat from foreign firms, as they felt that the stocks were empty after Japanese merchants purchased domestic wheat. Since January of this year, they have been applying to the producing areas to load and ship in batches to Shanghai to supply the various factories in Shanghai and other ports. However, as a result, the amount of foreign wheat purchased was limited, like a drop in the bucket, and it did not help. In order to maintain operations until the new domestic wheat is produced, the factories have successively suspended operations or reduced working hours. Currently, it is estimated that the factories that are operating are only operating at an average of 30%. All workers, except for a small number who are retained for work, have been temporarily dismissed and will be rehired after the new wheat comes on the market.</p>
<p>Current State of Wheat Production</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the weather has been abnormal, with continuous rain. The season has been suddenly cold and warm, so the wheat sown by farmers has been affected by the accumulation of water in the wheat fields. Although the weather has recently warmed up, the spring crops have been affected by this injury and have entered a state of illness. The future production volume will inevitably be reduced. The situation in the provinces south of the Yangtze River is similar, but according to the reporter's investigation, the wheat in provinces in North China, such as Shandong and Shanxi, is growing well due to the balanced climate and moderate rainfall. Its production can be predicted to be abundant.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Cracked Down on at Target Road</h3>
<p>All Foreign Residents from the Philippines and Japan; a Total of Fifty-Six People</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Hongkou Police Department received a tip that there was a secret gambling den in a house at No. 289, Target Road, set up by Japanese and Filipino residents, attracting people to join the game, determining the outcome by rolling two dice, with large wins and losses. After receiving the report, the police immediately notified the police chiefs of the American and Japanese consulates, who jointly assigned personnel to arrest them. They found people shouting and betting in the house, so they arrested 56 gamblers and confiscated two dice. After a brief interrogation at the police station, personnel from the American and Japanese consulates took the Japanese and Filipino gamblers to the American and Japanese consulates for interrogation.</p>

<p>Discussions</p>
<h3>Anti-Smuggling Movement</h3>
<p>— Why Bother</p>
<p>Our country's three major products, rice, tea, and silk, all have a "nightmarish" aspect now. For example, in Guangdong Province, foreign rice is imported duty-free, while in the interior, rice prices have plummeted due to an oversupply of grain. Furthermore, due to floods, droughts, war, and rural bankruptcy, farmers who regard land as a treasure are unable to support themselves. The tea market is not very clear, but with the promotion of Ceylon tea, the domestic tea market may also be very narrow. As for the silk industry, due to the rise of artificial silk, it has naturally "plummeted," "silk mills have stopped weighing," and "silkworm farmers regard raising silkworms as a dreaded task." These unfortunate news stories have become so commonplace that they no longer arouse people's concern. Since smuggling has become rampant, domestic silk has become even more miserable. In this precarious situation, we have seen the joint declaration of the Fuzhou silk industry, "declaring the implementation of refusing to sell smuggled goods in order to fulfill the patriotic duty of merchants."</p>
<p>The smuggling has affected more than just the silk industry. The call to "refuse to sell smuggled goods" seems to have been loudly proclaimed by all industries, but without the formal declaration of the Fuzhou silk industry. This method seems correct at first glance. If all industries unite to refuse to sell smuggled goods, and smuggled goods have no sales channels, smuggling will naturally disappear. However, this passive method is at least not feasible now. As the communication from the "Fujian Merchants' Anti-Smuggling Movement" said, "The famous silk shops that joined the trade association, also 'blinded by profit,' blatantly disregarded the association's sanctions and sold artificial silk products in large quantities, and not only sold them in this city, but also shipped them to various counties in eastern and northern Fujian for dumping. The reason is that the artificial silk and satin produced by a certain country have lower tariffs and lighter costs." Therefore, "last year, the total turnover of silk in the city was six million yuan. In addition to the 2.7 million yuan accounted for by the members of the silk industry association, smuggled goods, wholesale sales by foreign merchants, and stores and hawkers who did not join the association accounted for as much as 3.3 million yuan." It can be seen from this that even if the joint declaration takes effect, the "artificial silk and satin produced by a certain country" still has the advantage of "lower tariffs and lighter costs." Regarding the latter, since various countries are replacing labor with machines, all kinds of goods are now produced quickly and at low cost. For example, newspapers, which are closely related to our newspaper industry, when paper prices soared, we still had to wait until they rose to five yuan before customs (this was in January of this year, and it has already reached this number) before we could compete with foreign goods. Then, when they slightly lower the price, will we still have a "way out"? As for the former, we naturally don't need to say more.</p>
<p>However, when "armed anti-smuggling cannot be done in reality," "refusing to sell smuggled goods" is naturally a second-best option, because "if it is smuggled, the cost is light and light," and it is easy to take away the entire turnover of six million yuan in the city. On the other hand, how to improve the silk industry is also an urgent task for experts. Not only that, other national industries are no exception. Otherwise, they can still dump goods on the Chinese market due to the convenience of "lower tariffs and lighter costs."</p>
<p>"To fulfill the patriotic duty of merchants" cannot be seen to be effective by "being blinded by profit and being subject to association sanctions."</p>
<h3>Where are the Slum Dwellers Going?</h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>At the end of last month, we were still worried about the forced demolition of straw sheds on the 3rd of this month, which would cause "unpredictable dangers." However, now we are glad to see a "peaceful resolution." Of course, this so-called "peaceful resolution" is not as perfect as hoped. However, the slight easing of the tough attitude is the result of unanimous public opposition. But, after the "peaceful resolution," where will the slum dwellers go?</p>
<p>According to reports, the "peaceful resolution" is as follows: "The Public Works Department allows the slum dwellers to dismantle their own straw sheds, with a subsidy of fourteen yuan per household. The more than four hundred slum dwellers west of Lan Road are required to completely dismantle their sheds themselves before the 6th of this month." And the fourteen yuan subsidy has the following restrictions: "Slum dwellers who voluntarily dismantle their straw sheds must completely clear them before the 6th, and only then can they receive the fourteen yuan subsidy on the 10th. Those who do not dismantle by the 8th will still be forcibly demolished by the Public Works Department, and the subsidy will be cancelled." The signatory on behalf of the slum dwellers is Yin Yifu, and he "signed with the Public Works Department first and then notified the slum dwellers." There are quite a few questions here, but the weakness ultimately lies with the slum dwellers' representative, so we will leave him aside for now. But is this "peaceful resolution" a good solution? Let us now calculate this account. The Public Works Department's reason for not accepting the slum dwellers' suggestion is of course the issue of demolition time; and the reason for rejecting the Chinese directors' suggestion to "donate 100,000 yuan to build civilian villages for the slum dwellers" is probably not only the time issue, but also the cost issue. However, if we calculate the cost of subsidizing the slum dwellers, it doesn't seem to be the case. There are more than four hundred, almost five hundred slum households. At fourteen yuan per household, if we calculate based on four hundred and fifty households, it amounts to six thousand yuan. And this is only the first batch, there are other slum dwellers later. This subsidy alone, plus the "donation" (not including the slum dwellers' own savings), seems to be enough to build civilian villages, as long as the Public Works Department can understand the difficulties of the slum dwellers and postpone the demolition date to two or three months later.</p>
<p>Now, let us look at the miserable situation of the slum dwellers who painfully accept the "representative's" favor after being forced to relocate. The following situation was reported on the 5th: "Where do the demolished slum dwellers go? Most are wandering and sleeping on the streets, and a small number have moved to the slum areas east of Lan Road and started building new straw sheds." Even if we set aside the "miserable situation," the method itself does not seem to be entirely satisfactory.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the subsidy of fourteen yuan per household is an expense for the Public Works Department that could be used to subsidize the construction of villages; but the slum dwellers who receive it still gain nothing. Not to mention the loss of "ten to forty or fifty yuan" in the construction cost of the slum dwellers' straw sheds, the current livelihood of the slum dwellers has already become a problem. They must relocate before the 6th of this month, but they will not receive the fourteen yuan subsidy until four days later, which is not enough to solve the immediate problem. This is the first point. Secondly, in the past, although the straw sheds were simple, the problem of housing was at least solved. After receiving the fourteen yuan, they certainly cannot rely on this subsidy as a building cost, and they will have to bear an additional rent cost every month in the future. For poor slum dwellers, life is already without any guarantee. If they are forced to increase their burden, it is actually impossible.</p>
<p>Therefore, a bad result has already occurred. In the state before the demolition order, they are "building new straw sheds" elsewhere. Isn't this adding trouble to the Public Works Department? As for "sleeping on the streets," this is even more outside the scope of "cleaning up the city" and maintaining cleanliness and hygiene.</p>
<p>According to the news on the 5th, there are still more than two hundred households (half of the total) who have not yet complied with the order to relocate and demolish. Whether "unpredictable dangers" will occur by the deadline of the 8th is still unknown. However, even if all of them comply with the order and peacefully demolish, the slum dwellers still have nowhere to go. Being able to see the future result before the deadline should prompt them to abandon the stubborn approach, the narrow-mindedness of Zhou Zhi, and think of a better solution again, right? At the same time, the Chinese directors' suggestion to "donate 100,000 yuan to build civilian villages" should go beyond suggestion and become a reality. Because even if the Public Works Department does not agree, building houses is legal. Otherwise, where should those slum dwellers who "become exiles for fourteen yuan" go? At the same time, we also feel that after learning this lesson, the slum dwellers themselves should know where to go!</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Writings from D渡口 (D渡口, Dadu River Ferry)</h3>
<p>— Jinling</p>
<p>(Spring is here. The kite binds me with vast homesickness.)</p>
<p>The spring breeze passes over the fields and treetops, melancholically.</p>
<p>Like duckweed emerging from the pond, the greenness of life: this light blue sky reveals scales and claws from the grey clouds.</p>
<p>The rain-soaked countryside, the muddy fields, are the song sung by a voice that has returned to the tide. —The mud on the roads sticks to people's feet like their hearts.</p>
<p>The red buildings of the wounded soldiers' hospital, in this silent and vast sky, display a lonely, melancholic decline.</p>
<p>Along the only stone-paved street, two hundred houses are crowded together. The right side is covered with mud: the stumbling steps of passersby scatter the stains onto the half-yellow lime painted on the grass walls. —A river of sluggishly flowing life! Forever, forever slowly dragging on. Depression, like green mold, clings to the edge of this tranquil dream—when will it flow freely?</p>
<p>The sound of the zheng soars silently into the sky, trembling weakly! No one raises their head to look at it, except for the children who have lived in damp, low houses. The smoke lazily hangs on the chimney: but it only hovers like a whirlwind, swirling left and right, never rising straight up to the light blue sky with its scales and claws. Perhaps it also feels the oppressiveness of depression!</p>
<p>In the fields: like tea leaves dumped in the corner of a wall, moistened by the spring rain into a trace of green wheat sprouts, lying weakly on the pig-colored soil. It is a wrinkle of a smile etched on a bronze-colored face; but after all, the depression in the air is too strong, and the smile cannot bloom into a flower.</p>
<p>In that corner of the field ridge: under a few willow trees that have just turned green, an earthen wall encloses a circle. That is the public cemetery! —Originally a private cemetery, it later became a public cemetery because it was horizontally and vertically filled with buried wounded soldiers, so the owner indignantly gave it up! So it became a public cemetery!</p>
<p>My badger sister is buried here.</p>
<p>Growing up in the city, she was unaccustomed to the gloomy corrosion here, and she withered silently in loneliness. However, I do not feel great sorrow, because my sorrow goes to everything under that entire depression: to this stagnant, turbid river of life.</p>
<p>The embankment along the river: years of labor have planted countless blood and sweat. Yet it still always listens lightly and weakly to the blows of the river water.</p>
<p>Rows of wooden stakes are lined up on the edge of the embankment, intending to reduce the surging of the tide. But the sand and mud that can never be compacted are washed into a sinkhole by a wave.</p>
<p>The wooden stakes are also gradually being swallowed by the water.</p>
<p>The spring tide is rising: the embankment is even more weakly and lightly. It is frantically thinning day by day.</p>
<p>Is it hoping for the arrival of a violent wave?</p>
<p>(It's depressing enough here, wash it away!)</p>
<h3>Jingzi</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>Black coffee has a slightly bitter taste, but Jingzi's gentle heart is even more bitter than coffee.</p>
<p>There are memories, but she can no longer sort out when she was driven from her motherland to this barren island in the south! Jingzi's memories are as tangled as silkworms. People say that Singapore is the "Paris on the Equator," a golden and drunken metropolis, but what does this have to do with Jingzi? She smells the stench of money, tastes the astringent life, and she often cries out in her heart:</p>
<p>"Barren island! A place without laughter!"</p>
<p>Times without laughter are something Jingzi needs to cherish. She has to use laughter to disguise the lack of laughter almost all night. When the hand of night grabs this Paris on the Equator, Victoria Road is bustling with traffic, and the Neon-Light of the Capitol Cinema shines on Garbo and Robert Taylor's embrace, Jingzi applies a light rouge to her haggard cheeks, and smears Tangee on her faded lips; she shrugs her breasts and walks out. This coffee shop has comfortable seats, a velvet carpet, and a Radio that is on all night. Sometimes what is broadcast from the evil Radio is a traveler's longing for the bright sunshine of California, sometimes it is the lilac-like melancholy of a lovelorn person, and sometimes it is the "Blue Paradise" full of the atmosphere of the South Seas... Attracted by these different tunes are American sailors or British sailors with different emotions. They come from the civilized West but do not have the politeness of civilized people. When Jingzi serves them the whiskey or coffee they want, she often cannot avoid being dragged into the arms of a man by a pair of strong hands:</p>
<p>"Hallo Sweetheart"!</p>
<p>Sailors are wanderers of the earth, they change their environment from here to there. Last year in May, they were half-drunk in Honolulu, watching the hula dance with hazy eyes, and in October, when the autumn wind rose, they got lost on the streets of the Philippines, and it took them half a day of wandering to get back to the ship. Now, hugging Jingzi in their arms and teasing her with laughter, who knows where they will be in May next year? Wanderers of the earth can sometimes eat with chopsticks in a Chinese restaurant, and sometimes eat Mrs. Kikuko's handmade tea on the shore of Nagasaki...</p>
<p>Jingzi is their Sweetheart, their angel. But the person who calls her an angel today may never come again from tomorrow onwards. The whereabouts of modern people are so erratic.</p>
<p>And there are times when Jingzi's memories are sorted out. One day, she was slapped in the face for no reason by a drunkard with a medicine beard, and she cried out loudly, but no one sympathized with her. Instead, she heard the drunkard scolding her:</p>
<p>"A slave of a fallen country, humph!"</p>
<p>Korea, Jingzi's motherland is fallen. One day when Jingzi was young, she was taken by her fleeing father onto a boat heading to the southern island. Halfway there, her father was devastated by labor and chronic illness. Three months after arriving, he died. Jingzi grew up under the care of others and was also used by others. She has been pretending to be happy in front of people, but living a bitter life...</p>
<p>"A place without laughter! Barren island!"</p>
<p>Although she cried out like this in her heart, people said that this was the only big metropolis in the Malay Peninsula, the main military port of the Great British Empire, and symbolized it as the "Paris on the Equator." Jingzi withered in the laughter of people.</p>
<p>Jingzi, where are you going?</p>
