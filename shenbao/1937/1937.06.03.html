<p>蔣總監訓詞</p>
<p>今天是九十八年前林則徐先生在虎門焚燬烟土的紀念日、我們應該在這一天、切實檢查過去一年中禁烟工作、有無進步、更應該效法林公當日那種大無畏精神、來排除目前一切困離和阻碍、以求達到最後禁絕的目的、過去一年中、曾經把從前整個的和局部的禁烟章則、合併審查、加以修訂、頒行禁烟新法規多種、舊法規的精意所在、均予保留、而且補充完密、使與事實相適應、以期施行之澈底有效、腹地省份種烟、早已禁絕了、邊遠省份、如四川已禁種一百四十四縣、雲南已禁種八十五縣局區、貴州已禁種三十五縣、陝四已禁種七十三縣、甘肅已禁種三十二縣局、寗夏綏遠也都已局部禁種、產理自然漸漸减少、同時厲行烟民登記、嚴格管理、各省市已登記烟民三百六十二萬八千餘人、先後設立戒烟院所九百七十處、確定了分年分批傳戒的辦法、使烟民人數也漸漸减少、預定於二十九年一律禁絕、這是禁種和禁吸的大槪情形、至於禁運禁售、也隨着種烟區域的縮小、和烟民的减少、而使施行統制與管理、日趨嚴密烟毒的肅清、無論從國家政策或民族健康上說都是刻不容緩、應該是愈快愈好、可是實際的情形、就不很簡單、邊遠種烟省份除四川外、大都地方貧瘠或交通不便、近又災匪迭乘、人民痛苦已極、禁種鴉片和地方公私經濟關係很多、一萬多萬的民生問題、不能一槪不顧、我們為使禁烟工作確實有效起見、一面分年縮减種烟地畝、一面竭力發展邊省交通和救災理財、同時并進、原來迅速和確實、都是近代政治不可或缺的要素、我們要求迅速、同時我們更要求確實、這是各級辦理禁烟行政的同志所必須反省與共勉的、分年禁烟照此進行、相信必有效果、但是鴉片在中國的歷史這樣深遠直接間接靠鴉片為生活者、不下數十萬人、這數十萬人底潛力、就可以生出很大的阻礙、譬如政府禁種、他就偷種、政府要憑照購吸、他偏要無照私吸、政府統制運售、他却私運私售或公然阻礙禁令、或暗地推波助瀾、固然法律可以制裁、但仍恐百密一疏總有漏網、非賴全國民衆一致動員和這種惡魔奮鬥、依然不易肅清所以禁烟工作的成敗、又要看我們各級社會是不是共同一致、大家努力、我屢次指出中國人有個最大的毛病、就是所謂“各人自掃門前雪不管他人瓦上霜”這是絕對錯誤的心理、須知人類在社會共同生活中、一定要互助合作、對於危害我們整個民族的烟毒、更當疾惡如讐、譬如知道別人吸烟、或做鴉片生意就是領照的、也須勸他赶戒或改業、其私吸私運私售的、就應該報告官廳、去制裁他邊省禁種地方、對於禁人偷種烟苗、尤必切切實實的舉發剷禁、若是大家都能大公無私注意互助合作的精神、共除害馬補助官廳耳目的不及、那數十萬靠鴉片為生活的人、在四萬萬同胞中不過千分之一、自然不能阻碍我們整個國策的進行、我近年力倡新生活運動、各地都已風起雲湧、一致推行、這禁烟禁毒、就是實行新生活的最要基礎、新生活所注重的是整齊清潔迅速勤勞、和黑籍中人底懶散骯髒恰是相反、這過慣了懶散骯髒舊生活底人、簡直去死不遠我們自己固要力行新生活、但對人還要盡感化勸導的力量、務將這些黑籍中人從死坑裏拯救出來、纔盡了力行新生活的責任、禁烟進程中有一種很大危險、就是烈性毒品的代興、過去兩年、雖槍斃了不少毒犯長江上游、從前的嗎㫵廠也確已停歇、却是本國領土內、還有不能施禁的毒源存在、竟有些地方成了毒品的中心市塲、近來世界各國、都很注意所以禁烟公约明定有國際合作之條、最使我們感念、莫如前年國聯第二十屆禁烟會議中、日本代表所說“前此中國情形昏暗、未能鼓勵國際合作、譬如大火、而列强之能襄助者僅一勺之水、今危險已减少、則一勺之水、或有所裨益、余當盡力以助此一勺之水”、可見本身祇要努力、就不怕國際不相協約、我們處此環境總要盡其在我內竭自身底力量、外求國際的合作相信公理不泯、毒化危險、自有挽救機會、今天紀念先哲、愈使我們感奮、希望大家效法林公當日那種大無畏精神、急起直追、排除一切困難和阻碍、我們不要自餒、烟毒底禁絕、民族底復興、祇要全國一致努力、總不患無達到目的之一日、</p>

<h3>英國人對西班牙事變的態度（上）</h3>
<p>— （本報駐歐記者）列山</p>
<p>最近幾年來，每次國際間發生了糾紛事件，第一個感到頭痛的人無疑的是唐寗街的英國政治家。例如日本的强佔了我東北四省，德國的撕破凡爾塞條約而重整軍備，意大利更公然不顧英國的威脅出兵佔領了阿比西尼亞。這幾宗事實不但足使大英帝國的威望大受損傷，甚至於人家更認為這些都是英帝國行將崩毀的朕兆。所以當去年西班牙事變發生後，英國政府一知道弗朗哥將軍背後的引線人是德意兩國，早如驚弓之鳥，不敢公然作左右袒，致又把是非弄到自己身上來。倫敦“不干涉西班牙內戰委員會”的成立，此中英國外交家不知道費去多少苦心，經過了多少波折。雖然，英國這種婆心苦口高唱中立論調的態度，恰又絲亳得不到別人的同情。在德意看來，英國這個中立政策正是一種外交的技術，英國始終是同情西班牙人民陣綫政府的。在法俄並英國的反對黨—工黨自由黨等人看來，英國政府的軟弱政策只足以助長弗朗哥將軍的氣勢，間接是“助紂為虐”。首相飽爾溫在左右夾攻的空氣中，大有啞子吃黃連的氣槪。</p>
<p>英國對於西班牙事變眞的這麽漠不關心願意嚴守中立麽？目然，事實决不是這樣單純的。我們知道，英國目前主要的外交政策在於維持國際間已有的現狀，換一句話，就是，希望和平，在和中的口號下，維持他所已獲得的利益。新近保守黨政治家邱吉爾在一篇演講中說得十分痛快。他說，戰爭對於英國是絲亳沒有好處的。在下次戰爭中，英國只有損失，而沒有所獲得，所以他反對戰爭。他這種一針見血的說法的確道亟了一般英國人的心理。其次，英國人多年來所希望的歐陸均勢，目前也有相當成功。法俄的勢力并不在於德意之下，這一點很可以使英國袖手旁觀，不必再來自尋煩惱！雖然，西班牙事變究竟是有鬨際性的。英國想嚴守中立，而中立也有中立的難處。</p>
<p>假如只希特勒一人去帮忙弗朗哥將軍，那末英國人不見得就會焦急。德國想在地中海中摔足，就理論上也沒有什麽根據。但加上一位墨索里尼，情形就完全不同了。墨索里尼的野心，想達到地中海成為意大利內海的目的。這一點英國人决無法坐視。自從阿比西尼亞被意大利佔領以後，不但埃及已在意大利勢力包圍之中，甚至於地中海上英國海軍根據地馬爾太鳥，并波塞港都時有被意大利空軍轟炸的危險。萬西班牙事變中弗朗哥蔣軍再獲勝，那將使意大利空軍更可假道西班牙國土向吉布羅陀港進攻。吉布羅陀港一旦失守，不便英國的地中海艦隊勢力將於零，而最重要的，英國本部興殖民地間的海上交通更有中斷的可能，在英國的軍事立塲看來，自然希望“人民陣綫”政府勝利，一個社會黨統治的西班牙，比起費朗哥將軍意制的西班牙對於英國總是有利得多。英國想維持地中海上的霸權，就沒有眼看着西班牙“人民陣綫”政府崩毀的理由。</p>
<p>其實，就拿英國一般人民對於西班牙事變的態度來說，大部份倒是同情西班牙“人民陣綫”政府的。英國人雖說是個富有保守性的民族，但他們却愛護民主制度，厭惡獨裁。英國人固然不願意西班牙有一個左傾的“人民陣綫”政府，但這政府旣是由於多數人民選舉出來的，代表了人民的公意，那就算是個合法的政府。用武力去推翻政府，甚至於引起了流血的內戰，照英國人的看法最少是件不道德的行為。英國人不愛革命，無論這個革命是左派的或右派的。所以無論弗朗哥將軍如何宣傳，以保護人類文化的標語來號召，始終不容易傳得大部份英國人的同情。在英國人眼中他總是一位反叛的軍人！</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>工潮與物價</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>數月以來。沿海都市工潮澎湃。迄未寗止。昨據本報專電。則長沙紡織廠亦以待遇問題。刦持罷工。目聞省府方面。已定解散工會。從新登記工人。嚴拿工潮首要。以為解决風潮之手段。此種措置是否相宜。吾人目前旣不明風潮之眞相。自不能妄下斷語。但就此長沙罷工之事實。可見工潮已由沿海而蔓延及於內地省區。此誠不容吾人忽視者也。</p>
<p>夫工潮之發生其原因雖各不同。若就數月來之統計而觀。大致不外三途。要求增加工資興改善待遇。一也。减少工作時間。二也。援助其不幸工友。三也。此三者之原因。一言以蔽之。只求自身之生活安全而已。此種生活安全之要求。是否卽為越出軌外之行動。吾人必須平心靜氣。思考其原因是否屬於眞實。否則。貿然以罷工卽違法。不問其動機是否純粹。卽認為必有背景。而採用斷然之處置。竊恐非惟工潮不能泯滅。而社會且有更趨不安之可慮耳。</p>
<p>上述三種工潮之原因中。减少工作時間與援助工友二點。皆為個別的問題。吾人不能作一般的批評。至若改善待遇之要求。吾人認為不無相當理由。蓋近半年來。物價上漲之程度。實足令人憂懼。就最近全國各都市之物價指數而言。則四月之物價較之去年同期。上海已漲百分之十六•六。華北已漲百分之二二•五九。他如漢口與南京。則三月之物價。前者已較去年同期。增百分之十一•四。後者已增百分之十二。換言之。往日之可以一－元購得之貨。今則非一元一二角不辦矣。此物價高漲之反面。卽為“實質工資”之降低。今日工人之月入。少者數元。多亦不過數十元耳。彼等之支出。殆皆為省無可省之必要生活費。中則今日物價之上漲百分之二十。對於工人之打擊。覺得謂為不巨。而今日工人之要求改善待遇。亦豈得謂為無理。持平而論。因要求增加工資與改善待遇而罷工。其法雖屬可議。而其情實有可原。</p>
<p>抑近來物價之上漲一部分固由於經濟轉好之結果。要亦當有其不合理之原因。我國內地人民。知識未開。習用現銀。對於銀行紙幣。向抱懷疑之態度。故有貨物者。非至萬不得已。不願以現貨易紙幣。反之。有紙幣之收入者。莫不爭先恐後。紛紛易貨以是造成偽熊的供給减少與假象的需要增多。而一般商人。更復因緣為利。屯積居奇。操縱市塲。以遂私慾。似此陳陳相因。物價安得不貴。而工潮又安得不發生耶。</p>
<p>綜上所論。可知欲消滅今日之工潮。最主要者乃在於如何壓低今日之物價。而物價之壓低又必須從消滅物價暴騰之原因入手。如何使人民對紙幣發生信仰。如何鼓勵人民儲蓄之心理。皆為治本之道。至于目前治標方法。其最要者。當為如何取締操縱居奇之商人矣。</p>

<p>［東京］廣田弘毅之重任外相、令人憶及廣田於二十個月前所倡之三原則、此間外國人士對近衛內閣之將來外交政策、均能密切注視之態度、並對近衛內閣外交政策將與佐藤之見解大相逕庭一層、表示殷憂、惟一般視察家相信遠江嗣係局勢之變、尤某是我國之統一及已往數年全國之團結、均不容强力實施二原則且新閣中近衛之支配勢力、多少能於此際避免採取過度嚴峻外交政策之不智的觀念、雖然廣田重作馮婦之事實、至少表示近衛內閣外交政策置重於中國及蘇聯也云、（三日中央社電）</p>
<h3>親軍派佔勢日本新內閣成立</h3>
<p>賀屋任藏相廣田長外交　强化統制財界深懷憂懼</p>
<p>［東京］近衛內閣之閣員名單、已於三日全部正式决定、訂於四日午前舉行親任典禮後、卽行召開初次閣議、對於施政之根本方針、互換意見、大致當由近衛首相以談話之形式、對於施政大綱發表聲明云、（三日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］組閣工作幾經曲折、大致已告完成、聞其施政大網、當不出左列各項、㊀國體明徵與刷新文敎之澈底實現、㊁確立自主積極之外交政策、㊂確保財政產業政策、㊃實施國民生活安定策、㊄刷新議會制度並修改選舉法、欲使上項各政策具體化、必須更將企畫廳之機能增進、此為勢所必至、而於實行之際、又須以統制主義為全部之基調云、（三日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］日新首相近衛旣未獲得兒玉應允出掌財政、現對由前閣大藏省次官賀屋興宣升任大藏大臣、亦表滿意、據近衛昨日深夜對記者表示、藏相銓衡之困難、主要為軍部所提出之條件云、廣田與平生之分任外務商工兩相雖仍在接洽中、然實際上已內定、苟無意外事件發生、新閣可望於今日成立、從整個觀察新閣確為所謂舉國强力之內閣、但僅在新行政性質較為軍事法西斯化之意義上為舉國與强力、因內閣包羅廣田與林銑十郎兩內閣之最强有力份子、與旣成政黨之著名親軍派份子兩人故也、馬塲鍈一之出掌內務並兼任企劃廳總裁、已使財政界發生嚴重之憂懼、深恐將採用較林內閣更為極端之獨占政策、因此近衛在財政界中之聲譽、比在拜命組閣時大為减損矣、旣成政黨方面對新政府之組成、將犧牲彼輩一層所表示之惶懼亦漸增加、除近衛本人早已計劃組織新黨外、有林內閣成立時、巳抱鼓動組織新黨野心之有馬•及日本航空工業巨子與政友會主要財政支助者之一之中島、已確信至少能領導六十至七十議員加入新黨、永井亦久已傳為改組民政黨之領導者、至於新任書記官長風見章、雖於去歲一月脫離國民同盟、然仍在國民同盟與東方曾占有勢力、鑒於近衛馬塲之强大親軍傾向、以及中島•平生•有馬諸氏與軍事工業之密切關係、以近衛為黨魁之新黨、毫無疑義將為親軍右派刷新之政黨也、惟特別有意義者、厥為新閣已深塗封建主義之色彩矣、（二日中央社電）</p>

<h3>新閣特點</h3>
<p>［東京］近衛內閣之大部份閣員已經决定、以入閣人物觀察、新內閣之性質則馬塲內相兼任企劃廳總裁令人預想馬塲財政之實質的復活、又安井文相•有馬農相•風見書記官長等均為有特色之人、且由政黨方面選出中島•永井等所謂革新派之巨頭、由此觀之、近衛內閣雖為各派勢力之結合、然已坐上革新軌道、且取更欲進前一步之姿勢者頗為明顯、因此新內閣如何處理改正選舉法刷新議會制度等諸問題、又所謂新黨運動將來如何發展、可為一般人應注目之問題、（三日同盟電）</p>
<h3>新藏相略歷</h3>
<p>家寒苦學　擅長理財</p>
<p>［東京］新藏相賀屋興宣、廣島縣人、今年四十九歲、在大臣中當為潑剌之靑年、彼在靑春時代備嘗苦學之辛酸、大正六年畢業於東大法科、歷任大藏省書記官、主計局主計課長、豫算决豫課長、對於赤字財政之改建頗具手腕、一躍而㧞為主計局長、昭和十一年九月任為理財局長、同十二年二月陞任大藏次官、曾駐美國復充日內瓦及倫敦海軍軍縮會議之隨員、遊歷歐洲、除數字以外、不感覺興趣、其為人高近六尺、至為雄偉、常以畫寢為唯一之自慰、在東京豐島區西巢鴨地方置有私宅、訂為每月付欵、以十年付清、最近方能結束其房價、而於非常時期動輒結束數十億財政之賀屋式、其本身相當貧困、於此可見一般、茲據其夫人語人如左、先生不吸烟亦不嗜酒、但喜作高而富球戲、技倆頗不弱、閑時以此為娛樂、至於身為大臣、未知其體力能耐否云云、（三日同盟電）</p>
<h3>國聯委員會席上各國代表痛詆日毒禍中國</h3>
<p>提出數字鑿鑿有據　日本代表支吾其詞</p>
<p>［日內瓦］國聯鴉片顧問委員會昨日討論遠東問題時、美國與埃及代表公開痛斥日本在滿洲及華北各省、推行毒化政策、美代表富勒宣稱、東三省及熱河為世界上僅有區域、該處當局不但不防止毒品之貿易、而且由政府專賣、從中取利、一九三五年滿洲某大鎮為吸鴉片而死者竟達六千人、而政府一九三七年計劃、更勒令增加百分二十五之鴉片出產云、埃及代表魯塞爾（按魯氏英國籍、為公認世界研究毒品貿易問題最大權威之一）宣稱、全世界百分九十之白丸、皆係日本人所造、其地點在天津大連瀋陽及東三省熱河各鎮、概為日本人監督製造、單以天津一地而論、每週輸往外國之海洛因竟達五百兛、其中百分六十直接運往美國推銷、百分之三十則由歐洲港口轉運美洲、此外專賣鴉片機關更强迫抵押農田、悉以種植毒品、因而控制之土地日益增加、而使當地農民盡變乞丐云、美埃兩代表攻擊完畢、日代表橫山起立辯護、謂日本政府最近已經頒佈三種法令、取締鴉片貿易、對於日本販烟者規定處以罰金、至於天津局勢、據稱係由於政治上不安所造成、必須該處秩序恢復、始能談到鴉片問題、繼謂滿洲及朝鮮已有救濟此種局勢之步驟、中國代表胡世澤公使繼起演說、報告中國當局處理此項問題之辦法、宣稱中國政府現已確定禁絕鴉片之六年計劃、規定對於種烟運烟販烟吸烟之各種刑罰、現時除七省外、已經禁種鴉片、而一九叫○年則將完全禁絕、現僅登記之三•七○○•○○○吸烟者尚可購烟、但彼輩已勒令在一定期間內戒除、現正施以有組織之治療、胡氏最後申稱、中國政府禁烟之嚴刑峻罰、收效至宏云、胡氏報告各節、極得美代表及與會各國之讚賞、（三日國民海通）</p>

<p>［倫敦］日本各報近頃發出消息稱、英國現正努力在中國發展經濟利益、英國駐華大使許閣森爵士並草擬一種計劃、用以鞏固英國在華之經濟勢力云、此間中國人士並不加以重視、並云、孔祥熙博士近在倫敦居留時旣未要求借欵、英國方面亦未提以欵項貸予中國、（中央社二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］今日下院中保守黨議員陶益爾提出協助中國設立金本位問題、陶氏詞問稱、鑒於黃金出產過度在商業上所造成之弊病、並在此項過量黃金未能為國際貿易膨脹自然吸收之前財相西門是否可與美政府磋商共同向中國建議、協助樹立金本位制並發行金幣、以代替售與美國之銀幣、西門答稱、中國迄今尚未表示建文金本位之意思、且以環境而言、此種建議、似亦不合實際云、（中央社三日路透電）</p>

<h3>西班牙問題英向法德意建議</h3>
<p>撤戰鬥員監察安全並重　談判尚順利手續有困難</p>
<p>［倫敦］英外相艾登聞已於今日向帝國會織主要代表宣布、英國已向法德意建議、內載三項辦法、俾使德意重返不干涉委員會合作、所謂三項辦法者、聞為㊀在西班牙海面擴大安全區域、由監察各國軍艦寄椗、㊁監察國軍艦如受侵犯、則予以保障、㊂將來如再發生事件、由監察各國艦隊司令協商應付辦法、並悉艾登外相今日對於局勢頗為樂觀、謂數日來歐局已大見和緩、英國力謀德意兩國及早重返不干涉委員會、聞法政府對英建議已贊同、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］今日送達不干涉委員會各國政府之牒文中、曾具有擔保西班牙領海內不干涉委員會監察軍艦不受侵襲之建議、外相艾登今日在下院發表此事時、曾言英政府認今日最重要之目的、卽為國際間之合作、及海上監察之恢復安全、而不致發生延稽、再則、英政府之所以重視是項建議者、尤在使外籍戰鬥員之撤回、能獲迅速之進展、因現在局勢已極為緊急也、（中央社三日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］德意兩國退出調整委員會、並不再參加西班牙海面監察工作所產生局勢、現在大體上業已獲有解决辦法、擴大監察宿命區域兼及於西班牙各港口一層、已在原則上成立妥洽、惟參加監察各國軍艦、遇有遭受侵犯情事、應行施共同懲戒之一問題則因在技術上尚有各項重大困難、故不克迅速獲得解决、據英國官方透露消息稱、英國政府現擬向法德意三國政府、提出問題者、請各就保證參加監察各國軍艦安全一事、建議具體辦法、至所謂技術上之困難、其中最重要者、為以下各項、參加監察各國海軍艦隊互助一項原則、足使參加監察之海軍艦隊、成為國際性質、根擄此項原則、必須指派外國視察員、有各軍艦監督行動、藉使西班牙內戰雙方無從藉口、以攻擊參加監察之軍艦但英國海軍部則不許外國視察員登英國軍艦、此其困難一也、擴大安全區域、並准許參加監察軍艦、停泊西班牙各港口、此層必須經西班牙內戰當事雙方允許而後可、但此種辦法一日實行、則向來袒護內戰雙方中一方之軍艦、務當相戒、萬弗利用停泊雙方所屬口岸之便利、而向內戰之友方報告消息、此其二也、遇有參加監察軍艦、遭西班牙內戰任何　一方攻擊時各國軍艦、應向攻擊者施行集體懲戒、此項辦法、困難最為重大、蓋倘發生此種集體懲戒之事實、則其責任、自當由各國軍艦及各國政府共同負之、結果必不免引起政治的技術的種種困難、英國內閣多數閣員以為此種計劃、足使英國對於西班牙內亂、牽涉過深、而英法德意四國艦隊合作之結果、卽無異成立四國公約、自非英國多數閣員所能贊成、此其困難三也、抑集體懲戒之辦法、鮮有實施之可能、蓋對內戰一方、表示同情之國家、大約均不願向某友方行便懲戒、此其困難四也、（中央社二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［華盛頓］關於德國軍艦砲擊西班牙國阿爾米利亞港一事、美國方面頃已發生一種强有力之運動、主張德意兩國若不重行參加不干涉政策、美國卽當以中立法制裁之、此種運動雖由著名參議員波拉所發起、但美國大多數人民、仍主張避不捲入漩渦、卽美國政府在目前亦不致考慮及此、特局勢若果益見惡化、則美國或當重行考慮應付方法、亦未可知耳、關於此層、參議院外交委員會主席畢特門於昨日宣稱、本委員會不擬要求羅斯福總統執行中立法、以免危及和平局勢、此外、羅斯福總統業巳銷假回京、卽當與國務卿赫爾討論西班牙局勢、屆時美國政府所可採取之態度、當可决定、此在政界人士以為、美國在現行局勢之下、對於德意曁西班牙三國、同時實施中立法其事甚屬危險云、（中央社三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>鐵肺人</h3>
<p>— 子蘭</p>
<p>關於鐵肺人，這幾天報上登得很熱鬧，街頭巷尾，茶坊酒肆，也談得很起勁，人們都帶着感嘆的口氣驚奇着：一個生了麻痺病的人，旣說是連呼吸都快要停止了，何以睡在那個圓筒的鐵肺中，就會不死了呢？要解答這個驚奇的疑問，除了敬佩于近世醫藥上的發明外，有我，是不能再贅隻字的:我想大部份人也正如此。不過，在人們的驚奇中，是還有着對不可抗，也不可測的壽命的信念發生動搖的，“閻王註定三更死，决不留人到五更，”現在則因為鐵肺的發明，那位美國靑年施奈德卸被留在世上四百多天了。</p>
<p>定命論者自然還找得到許多問題來質難，但這却是可以以一個總的反問來回答：要是“鐵肺”還未發明，那位靑年是否能活下去呢？而現在，却因為他是富翁，他用他的財富在苟延他的生命！</p>
<p>用財富在苟延生命，或許這正是定命論者作為命中註定的最好理由，但如果財富和鐵肺兩者失其一，則又從何解釋？在現在，我相信，因為沒有這廣大的財富而害麻痺病死去的人，一定是頗不少的！</p>
<p>也不單麻痺病患者如此。近世醫學的發達，不要說苟延生命，就是生在窮人必然一命嗚呼，而富翁患之可以起死回生的，也多的是！語有云：“有錢難買閣王命，”這難道也是嗎？</p>
<p>這祇是科學成了私有財產制的奴隸而已！</p>
<p>再說到鐵肺，鐵肺在現在似乎還祇能做到使麻痺症者苟延生命，而不能使患者霍然而愈；將來呢，我想用種種治療方法，訂痺大槪是也可以不成為束手的絕症的。</p>
<p>所以，在這樣的希望下，苟延生命才不失其為活下去的理由，而為了供給醫學上的研究，留着活標本給醫學者試騐，那活標本才更有其茍延生命的理由。</p>
<p>人，在社會上有生存下去的權利者，據我的理解，則應該他是一個生利者，祗少，他不是一個完全的消耗者，在現在的社會制度裏，固然飽食終日，無所事事者是多得很，而且在享用上是比終日勞作者優厚得多多，但是，這些，充其量祇是一架行尸走肉而已，在未來的新的社會裏，他們必然地要被淘汰的。這些行尸走肉，康健地活着是對社會一無好處，病了，社會也並不受礙，或者，反可以說，因為他們的病，使醫學促起進步，對未來的社會可以减少死亡，减少疾病的痛苦，這倒是反而有益的。</p>
<p>自然，這還有待于將來一切享受，是否澈底的平等而定。不然，科學成為資產者的差役，苟延生命四百幾十天就得化美金十八萬元，那麽，卽有重大發明，於大衆絕緣還是同樣的。</p>
<h3>梁桐芳的自殺</h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>死，有重於泰山，也有輕於鴻毛者。同一的死，可以給人以不同的觀感。有些人死了，呌人槌胸號啕，悲不能抑，可是有些人死了，却呌人哈哈大笑，稱快不已！</p>
<p>自殺，就是把自己的生命因為自己的思想陷於混亂之中，而又不能得到解脫，就下了個决心來結束牠。一切矛盾，因“自殺”而得到解决。所謂一切矛盾因自殺而得到解决，那只是自殺者被一切的矛盾而解决的意義。自殺者只是犧牲在一切矛盾之下，一切矛盾還是一切矛盾牠們（一切矛盾）正如蜘網一樣，儘可能的來吸收自投羅網的“犧牲者”，同時，牠們也在跟一切不願自殺的人們决鬥着。</p>
<p>梁桐芳，這位“斷臂志士”誰都欽佩他的，因為他有勇敢，他有過分的熱情，他能拿着炸彈，不顧自己的生命，來向無恥的奸商投下一顆爆烈的炸彈，讓這顆炸彈把奸商們炸醒悟過來。在他的腦際中，認為人是有“良心”的，或者人是“貪生怕死”的，他却認不清楚，人的“良心”早被“利慾”燒掉了，貪生倒的確貪生的，怕死是更加了，因為越是這種人，越是貪生，越是怕死。因為貪生，所以才拚命而一點也不顧到國家的利益，使他個人的生活過得如天上的皇帝一樣。他們曉得他們的生命已在炸彈之前了，（當然，不是在一個人手裏的一顆炸彈之前”，為着貪生，為着怕死，他們才不顧到國家的蒙損，把國家出賣給敵人！</p>
<p>一個人拿炸彈去打擊奸商，這種精神誠然是可敬可愛，然而總究是不能收大效果的舉動，我們早已不敢贊同了！因為打擊奸商，一顆炸彈是不够的，一個人單獨的行動也是不够的，這是需要集體的行動，無數萬顆的炸彈的！</p>
<p>用自殺的手段來喚起同胞們的注意，這可比起一個人手拿炸彈去打擊奸商還要不高明得多！梁桐芳的自殺遺書裏，因對各大公司販賣私貨，頗為憤慨，這憤慨凡是中國人都有的，然而大家因憤慨而如梁桐芳一樣自殺了，這不是很好麽？敵人不用一槍一彈，把我們殺光了！這事情總是他們太便宜了！</p>
<p>我們不應該做自投羅網的犧牲者，我們要活着，不被一切矛盾解决，而要去解决一切矛盾，自殺是幹不得的！</p>
<h3>生男生女能够豫决的新發明</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>據倫敦彙聞報載稱，科學家兼發明家洛氏，現充某大學教授，曾說起一種豫决男女性的發明假使這個理想，果眞實在，那人類種族的趨勢，恐怕要因此完全改變，數百千年來似乎不能解决的人口問題，從此將有個着落了。洛敎</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>授説道：哈萊街有兩位醫學顧問，目下正在實施豫决男女性的方法，我雖然不敢自稱有醫學智識，但從科學上着想，這兩位醫學高深的顧問的理想，確有科學上的根據，使它成爲事實。世界上的父母，有的願意生男，有的願意生女，但往往天不如人之願，想生男的，却生了女，想生女的，却生了男。因此這兩位顧問便專心研究，費了許多年的辛苦，成功一種流質，可保想生男的决能生男，想生女的决能生女，真可謂功勝造化。他們已試騐了百餘次，結果百分之九十得到效騐，假使成數更高的話，這種流質，可算得百發百中了。請教這兩位顧問的人，都是富户，他們都出百鎊的代價，買這流質，他們只求償願，不惜金錢。現在四方請求的，大有應接不暇之勢哩。洛教授僅以科學觀察家的眼光，關心這種新發明，他又推測這事可能的影響道：這種豫决男女性的方法，各界人士，或將加以攻擊，指爲干涉造化之功，其實造化也有豫决男女性的功能。科學家跟醫學家抱這夢想，已有若干世紀之久。不過他日大規模實施以後，怕有男女人數不平均的危險，因爲爲父母的，大多數願生男，而不願生女，願生男孩的要佔三成，願生女孩的，只有一成。假使國家不嚴訂法律，加以取締，那末，男性人數，定將遠出女性之上，不但將引起家族問題，並且將引起國家問題。今日的狄克推多，都願增高他們的戰鬥力，自然願意國中多生男孩，這是可以想像得到的。假使女性大感缺乏，還很容易促成戰爭，古代常爲奪取女子跟糧食，而動干戈，女性一旦大感缺乏，便會成貴重的“勝利品”，將來怕要爲了女子，而出於戰爭吧。</p>
<h3>家</h3>
<p>— 林加</p>
<p>我不能像一個諳熟的漁人那樣，當風暴來時，忙忙的去撑着舵。只好被汹湧的狂流吞沒，如一片落葉委身於西風一樣。……近來，每當冥坐在一盞孤燈下，常常替生活下這樣一個譬喻。我覺得很恰當，正似拿一片落葉來比擬流浪人的漂泊。</p>
<p>漂泊的人，有時會休息的，漂泊的心却仍是一條不寗靜的溪流。</p>
<p>秋天的夕暮，我懷着一顆慚愧的心，肩着僅有的行囊，叩打着故園鐵銹門環，風雨蝕剝的木門上，飄零着斑點陳舊的春聯，靑石的階縫中，冒出一叢叢微黃的草芽，牆頭，覆了層霜紅的爬山虎，低垂着，在習習晚風中顫顫的飄動。</p>
<p>回想別離家時，白髪種的媽媽，在曉風下，持着經燈，倚在門墻邊，破曉的星光，在淺黑的天暮上，疏朗的泛出銀白。雞聲，連續的穿過樹梢，我拐出古老的巷口，沒敢再回頭望望那鬼火般的燈影……院裏一䧃達達的脚步聲，漸漸近了，門也呀然的開了，有細細的灰塵隨了震盪飛落下來，彎腰的老僕人抹着眼睛，在他嘴邊，長滿了一叢枯麻綫似的鬍鬚。</p>
<p>“呵，你不認得我了，”</p>
<p>他木呆的唔唔了兩聲，依然是陌生的應付着一個生客的神情，我從心底裊出一縷辛酸的惋惜，他老了，他一時看不出我這久別的少年人。</p>
<p>邁進門去，擎天的老槐樹浴着半身夕陽，在凉風中搖着影子，映壁脚下，撒滿了綠的蘚苦，轉過去有一隻荷花缸，那裏尚埋着幾根枯梗，撑了破裂的蓮葉，索索的，把院中配襯得更荒涼了。</p>
<p>那古舊的廳房里，微黃的窗紙上，透出暗簿的幽光，母親老了，白髪更多了，她整年伴着耶壁角里的鐘，在無盡的滴塔中把歲月混了過去。</p>
<p>臨窗的長木案上有盆菊花，伸着細弱的枝子，一串串的綠葉垂下來，</p>
<p>一匹靑狗驚異的臭着我的衣襟，滿含着惡意的低低的吠呌，我默然的走到母親旁邊，喊了一聲幾年來沒喊過的媽，她有些怪異的扭轉頭來，閃動着她灰色的昏花的眼睛，顫聲的說：</p>
<p>“我只打算你忘了家了！”</p>
<p>我想撲到媽媽懷里痛快的哭一塲，幾年来我為一個渺茫的夢，在薄情的人海中浮沉，受着無盡的屈辱與損害，當淚水湧上眼睛，便用嚴冬般酷寒的情緒按押住，我跟她說永遠也不再離開這溫暖的家園，將住在後院的那棵榆樹壓着的屋里，仍讀那黑色木架上的古書，仍座在父親坐了半世的靠椅上，件着她，平安的看長工們種那二十畝菜園，冬初收佃戶們送來的租錢，一切都是這老年人所盼望的，如今為了安慰她心葉上的傷疤，—姐姐的遠嫁，我將又變成一個安隱的孩子，默默的生活下去……</p>

<h3>The Jin-Sheng Agricultural Garden Incident in Tianjin Will Not Escalate After Negotiation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Sent Personnel to Visit the Japanese Consul Yesterday; The Japanese Side Has Promised Three Items; The County Magistrate of Jin County Went to the Site for Inspection</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Regarding the case of the Jin-Louzhuangzi Sheng Agricultural Garden, the Japanese Vice-Consul Nishida Nagayasu visited Secretary-General Ma Yanchong of the Municipal Government at 2 PM on the second month, making a verbal representation. Ma agreed to report to Mayor Zhang and replied. At 7 AM on the third, the Municipal Government received instructions by phone from Zhang Youping and immediately dispatched Councilor Lu Nansheng with a representative from the Jin County Government Police Bureau to visit the Japanese Consul. They promised: 1. To thoroughly investigate the cause of the fire at the Sheng Agricultural Garden. 2. To protect the Japanese people surrounded at Sheng. 3. To release Gu Enfu. If there are no unexpected changes in this case, it can be resolved peacefully after a few more contacts. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] On the third, Japanese police in Sheng Agricultural Garden unearthed a Chinese corpse in the ash pit, which was allegedly the arsonist. At 10 AM, Jin County Magistrate Chen Zhongyue led Section Chief Bai Dunbi, Secretary Li Haihuan, etc., to investigate. It was discovered that although the corpse was said to have been burned to death, it did not show signs of struggling. The face was scorched black, making it impossible to identify the gender. The court was notified, and personnel were dispatched at 4 PM for an autopsy before burial. Zhang Zizhong is scheduled to return to Tianjin on the fourth. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Regarding the Sheng Agricultural Garden arson incident, Jin County Magistrate Chen Zhongyue, together with County Government Section Chief Bai Lunbi and others, went to inspect the site again at 10 AM on the morning of the third. After some negotiation, they obtained permission from the Japanese supervisors to enter and inspect. A burned corpse was unearthed from the burned warehouse. The corpse was lying face up, the flesh on the face was roasted off, and the lower body was also incomplete, making it impossible to identify the gender. However, although the corpse was burned to death, the entire body did not exhibit a contracted muscle structure. At the same time, after this incident occurred, the Japanese side has acknowledged that all the staff of the Sheng Agricultural Garden are safe and sound. The Jin County Government immediately telegraphed the court for an autopsy. After Chen returned to Tianjin, he reported everything to the Municipal Government, which then submitted the entire case to the Political Affairs Committee for instructions.

<h3>The Atmosphere in Northern Chahar Remains Tense After the Suppression of the Popular Uprising</h3>
<p>The Volunteers Were Dispersed by the Puppet Security Forces; Infighting Has Repeatedly Led to Mutiny Within the Bandit Troops</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] On the first day, the people of northern Chahar successively rose up in self-defense in Chongli, Zhangbei, and other places. At the time, the puppet forces were unaware of the underlying reasons and were extremely panicked. After realizing that it was an unsystematic and unorganized action, they used drastic measures and dispatched troops to suppress them separately. The volunteers of Tao Lai Miao Village were dispersed by the Chongli puppet security forces on the night of the second. On the third, the situation returned to normal. Zhangbei and other places also subsided successively, but the atmosphere remained tense. Chang Ziyi's troops were disarmed by the puppet forces in Dalian Di the day before, and Chang's whereabouts are unknown.

<h3>Zhu Qinglan Returns to Nanjing to Talk About the Disaster Relief Survey</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Zhu Qinglan left Nanjing on April 17th and personally went to Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Henan and other provinces to inspect the disaster situation, traveling more than 10,000 miles, and went as far as the Jiayuguan Pass in Gansu and the Qinghai and Ningxia provinces. After 47 days of journey, he arrived in Nanjing by train from Kaifeng at 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the third with his secretary Rao Pinxiang. Zhu was dressed in coarse cloth shoes, his face covered with dust. Although he is nearly seventy years old, he is energetic and does not feel tired. After entering the city, he returned to the Relief Committee to rest and then talked in detail with the Central News Agency reporter about his disaster survey. He said: "I left Beijing on April 17th and went to Shanghai. I arrived in Chongqing from Shanghai on the 19th to inquire about the disaster situation in eastern Sichuan. It happened that Wanxian was hit by a major fire three days ago, so I telegraphed the Beijing and Shanghai associations to allocate funds for relief. On the 21st, I flew to Chengdu to meet with representatives of the disaster-stricken counties throughout the province and listened to disaster reports. Then, I convened representatives from the provincial government and various departments of the provincial relief association, as well as local gentry, to discuss relief matters. At that time, it was agreed that in addition to the public bonds allocated by the central government, the province would also raise another million to be distributed for relief. At the same time, the provincial government and the provincial relief association were instructed to select and dispatch more than 130 investigators. I personally trained them. The investigators went to the counties at the end of April and selected investigators in their respective counties, more than ten people in each county, to train them. They were then assigned to districts to go to the countryside to investigate households and issue tickets. This work takes about three weeks in small counties and about a month in large counties. Because relief funds are limited and the disaster is widespread, it is necessary to formulate detailed measures and conduct strict investigations to ensure that disaster victims who cannot survive without relief can truly be rescued, so that they can live up to the central government's intentions. In addition, Cao Zhongzhi, a special commissioner from the Ministry of Finance, personally went to the counties for investigation. Cao set off on April 29th, and I also flew to Shaanxi and then to Gansu on the same day. Before leaving Sichuan, I telegraphed Commissioner Hong San from Kangding to return east as quickly as possible to be responsible for supervision of distribution. This is a general overview of the Sichuan relief arrangements. Later, on May 1st, I arrived in Lanzhou and discussed relief matters with local people from all circles and Du Yannian, the general supervisor of Gansu. I made a preliminary allocation of relief funds for each county. On the 6th, I took a car to Hexi to inspect the disaster situation, passing through Yongdeng, Gulang, Wuwei, Yongchang, Shandan, Zhangye, Fumin, Minle, Piquan, Gaotai, Linze, and as far as the Jiayuguan Pass. I made a round of the most severely affected areas, taking two weeks. What I saw was that the houses were like ruins and the people were unclothed. Their living conditions were more miserable than beggars in the interior, something I had never seen since I started handling disaster relief. In addition to immediately asking the central government to allocate additional relief funds, I also advocated the establishment of orphanages in the counties, and the funds needed were also telegraphed to charitable people in various provinces to collect on behalf of them. On the 21st, I transferred from Yongdeng to Xining and discussed the relief of Mongol and Tibetan tribes with the Qinghai Provincial Government. Because the central government allocated only 100,000 yuan for relief, and the Han people in the counties suffered severe hail and war disasters, which was not enough to provide relief, I telegraphed again to the ministry to increase the allocation of funds so that they could be handled. On the 23rd, I returned to Lanzhou. At that time, Chairman He had arrived in the province, so I discussed Gansu relief again. On the 26th, I flew to Ningxia to meet with Chairman Ma and Supervisor Sun Xianqing to inquire about the distribution of accounts and inspect the ancient canals on both sides of the Yellow River from the Han, Tang, and Qing dynasties. I discussed immigration and reclamation methods. I returned to Lanzhou on the same day. On the 27th, I went to Xi'an. On the 29th, I went to Fufeng to inspect the disaster children's orphanage. On the 30th, I returned to the province and took the car east that night. On the 31st, I arrived in Luoyang, stayed overnight, and met with Supervisor Tang Zongguo and Commissioner Yang Zigong, Deputy Director Li Shaohua, Relief Director Feng Yangshan, and local people to inquire about the disaster situation in western Henan. On the 1st, I arrived in Kaifeng and discussed with Chairman Shang and others about continuing to relieve the disaster victims in western Henan. On the 2nd, I left Kaifeng and returned to Beijing. Also, on the way, I heard that there were misunderstandings about the Sichuan relief allocation, so I immediately ordered the association to report the process as soon as possible. According to the time required for the investigation procedures, the central government's relief funds were remitted on the 17th of last month. I am afraid that it will still have to be stored in Chengdu for several days before the distribution period in each county arrives. After returning to Beijing, I heard that Sichuan Province had raised 1 million yuan for relief, which was allocated on the 1st after repeated telegrams from the association, which is very gratifying.

<p>[Nanjing] Zhu Qinglan, the head of the Relief Committee, completed his survey of disaster-stricken areas in Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Ningxia, Qinghai and other provinces and arrived in Nanjing on the afternoon of the third.

<h3>"June 3rd" Anti-Smoking Commemorative Meetings Held Across Various Regions</h3>
<p>Anti-Smoking Association Holds Commemorative Meeting; Large Quantities of Drugs and Smoking Paraphernalia Burned; Three Principal Offenders Executed by Firing Squad in the Capital</p>
<p>[Nanjing] On the 3rd, Anti-Smoking Commemoration Day, the Anti-Smoking Association held a commemorative meeting at the Lixing Society at 9:00 AM. Representatives included Feng Yuxiang, representing the Central Government; Deng Jiayan, representing the National Government; and hundreds of representatives from various Yuan, departments, and agencies. Ms. Ulimus, representing the Geneva Anti-Drug Propaganda Office, also attended. Gan Naiguang, standing committee member of the Association, representing Jiang, the concurrent Chief Supervisor, presided over the meeting. After the usual formalities, Gan delivered a speech and read out Chief Supervisor Jiang's instructions. Li Zhonggong, standing committee member, then reported on the progress of anti-smoking and anti-drug efforts over the past year. Next, Feng Yuxiang and Deng Jiayan delivered their instructions. The meeting adjourned around 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Chief Supervisor Jiang's Instructions</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of Lin Zexu's burning of opium at Humen ninety-eight years ago. On this day, we should earnestly examine the progress of our anti-smoking work over the past year. We should also emulate Lin Gong's fearless spirit in overcoming all current difficulties and obstacles to achieve the ultimate goal of complete eradication. In the past year, we have reviewed and revised all previous comprehensive and partial anti-smoking regulations, promulgating multiple new anti-smoking laws and regulations. The essence of the old regulations has been preserved, and they have been supplemented and improved to adapt to the current situation, aiming for thorough and effective implementation. Opium cultivation in the inland provinces has long been banned. In the remote provinces, Sichuan has banned cultivation in 144 counties, Yunnan in 85 county districts, Guizhou in 35 counties, Shaanxi in 73 counties, and Gansu in 32 county districts. Partial bans on cultivation have also been implemented in Ningxia and Suiyuan. Natural production is gradually decreasing. At the same time, we have strictly managed and registered opium addicts. Over 3,628,000 opium addicts have been registered in various provinces and cities. 970 rehabilitation centers have been established, and a phased, batch-by-batch rehabilitation method has been established, gradually reducing the number of addicts. It is planned that all opium use will be completely eradicated by the 29th year [of the Republic]. This is a general overview of the situation regarding the prohibition of cultivation and use. As for the prohibition of transportation and sale, its implementation of control and management has become increasingly strict along with the shrinking of cultivation areas and the reduction in the number of addicts. The eradication of opium is an urgent matter, both from the perspective of national policy and national health. The sooner, the better. However, the actual situation is not so simple. Remote opium-growing provinces, with the exception of Sichuan, are mostly impoverished or have inconvenient transportation. Recently, they have been hit by successive disasters and banditry, and the people are suffering greatly. The prohibition of opium cultivation is closely related to local public and private economies. The livelihood issues of over ten million people cannot be ignored. To ensure the effectiveness of anti-smoking work, we are simultaneously reducing opium planting acreage annually and striving to develop transportation and disaster relief and financial management in the border provinces. Speed and certainty are indispensable elements of modern politics. We demand speed, but we demand certainty even more. This is something that comrades at all levels involved in anti-smoking administration must reflect on and strive for together. If anti-smoking continues in this way year by year, I believe it will be effective. However, opium has a long history in China. Those who depend on opium for their livelihood, directly or indirectly, number no less than hundreds of thousands. The potential of these hundreds of thousands of people can create significant obstacles. For example, if the government prohibits cultivation, they will cultivate it secretly. If the government requires permits for purchase and use, they will insist on using it privately without permits. If the government controls transportation and sale, they will transport and sell it privately, or openly obstruct the prohibition orders, or secretly fuel the flames. Of course, the law can sanction them, but I am still afraid that even with the best precautions, some will slip through the net. It is still not easy to eradicate opium without the united mobilization of the entire nation and a fight against this evil. Therefore, the success or failure of anti-smoking work depends on whether our society at all levels is united and working together. I have repeatedly pointed out that Chinese people have a major flaw, which is the so-called "each sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and does not care about the frost on others' roofs." This is an absolutely wrong mentality. It must be understood that in social life, humans must help and cooperate with each other. We should hate opium, which harms our entire nation, as if it were an enemy. For example, if we know that someone is smoking opium or doing opium business, even if they have a permit, we must persuade them to quit or change professions. Those who secretly smoke, transport, or sell opium should be reported to the authorities for punishment. In areas where opium cultivation is prohibited, we must thoroughly report and eradicate those who secretly plant opium seedlings. If everyone can be selfless and pay attention to the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, eliminating the harm and supplementing the shortcomings of the government's ears and eyes, then the hundreds of thousands of people who depend on opium for their livelihood, who are only one in four hundred million, will naturally not be able to hinder the progress of our entire national policy. In recent years, I have strongly advocated the New Life Movement, which has spread like wildfire across the country. This prohibition of opium and drugs is the most important foundation for implementing the New Life. The New Life emphasizes order, cleanliness, speed, and diligence, which are the opposite of the laziness and dirtiness of those involved in the opium trade. Those who are accustomed to a lazy and dirty old life are simply not far from death. We must not only practice the New Life ourselves, but also do our best to influence and guide others, striving to rescue these people from the pit of death, thus fulfilling our responsibility to implement the New Life. There is a great danger in the process of anti-smoking, which is the rise of highly addictive drugs as substitutes. In the past two years, although many drug offenders have been executed by firing squad, and the morphine factories upstream of the Yangtze River have indeed been shut down, there are still sources of drugs within our national territory that cannot be banned. Some places have even become drug distribution hubs. Recently, countries around the world have paid close attention to this. Therefore, the anti-smoking convention clearly stipulates international cooperation. What we are most grateful for is what the Japanese representative said at the 20th League of Nations Anti-Smoking Conference two years ago: "Previously, the situation in China was dark, and it was impossible to encourage international cooperation. It was like a great fire, and the great powers could only help with a spoonful of water. Now that the danger has decreased, a spoonful of water may be of some help. I will do my best to help with this spoonful of water." It can be seen that as long as we make efforts ourselves, we need not fear that international cooperation will not be coordinated. In this environment, we must do our best internally and seek international cooperation externally. I believe that justice will not perish, and there will be opportunities to save us from the danger of drug addiction. Today, as we commemorate the sages, we are even more inspired. I hope that everyone will emulate Lin Gong's fearless spirit and immediately pursue and eliminate all difficulties and obstacles. We must not be discouraged. The eradication of opium and the revival of the nation will be achieved as long as the whole country works together. We need not worry that we will not reach our goal one day.</p>
<p>Anti-Smoking Administration Over the Past Year</p>
<p>The Anti-Smoking Association published a "Report on Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Efforts Over the Past Year." The document reviewed the efforts made in the past year, amid worries and anxieties, adhering to established policies, and working tirelessly to combat smoking and drugs. The content is divided into eight sections: ㊀ Describing the determination of anti-smoking policies and the changes in agencies; ㊁ Describing the formulation of anti-smoking and anti-drug laws and regulations and the implementation of severe sanctions against drug offenders, including provisions regarding the trial of citizens of treaty countries without consular jurisdiction in China for crimes, which have been incorporated into treaties. It has been resolved at meetings and circulated to courts nationwide that citizens of all countries without consular jurisdiction who commit opium-related crimes in China will be tried according to the usual litigation procedures in accordance with the anti-smoking and anti-drug criminal law regulations; ㊂ Stating that provinces such as Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, Shandong, Chahar, Shanxi, and Hunan are now absolutely forbidden opium-growing areas. Even Sichuan, which was once the most prosperous opium-producing area, has banned opium planting in 144 counties, Yunnan in 85 counties, Guizhou in 35 counties, Shaanxi in 73 counties, and Gansu in 75 counties, and by the deadline of the 28th year [of the Republic], opium cultivation will be completely prohibited. Large officials will be dispatched to inspect those who violate the ban on private planting, and seedlings will be eradicated immediately, and those who violate the ban will be punished. The achievements have been praised by foreigners; ㊃ Stating that 3.7 million opium addicts have been registered and have been given a deadline to quit. Those who conceal and do not report will be found out and forced to quit, and will be punished according to law; ㊄ Stating that the six-year anti-smoking plan has enabled opium to be gradually cleared under unified management, transportation, and distribution by the deadline; ㊅ Stating that the ban on highly addictive drugs has been strictly enforced. Since the 24th year [of the Republic], a two-year ban has been established. From this year on, those who manufacture, transport, sell, or use drugs will be executed by firing squad. In recent years, the number of drug offenders executed by firing squad has reached as many as 970. However, the situation in North China is special, and various treaty ports and concessions still exist, making it difficult to completely eliminate the source of drugs. This is a major obstacle, but it is an overall international issue, and we can only strive to make progress and seek relief; ㊆ Stating the relationship between anti-smoking and international relations, claiming that anti-smoking is something that all countries in the world should jointly strive for. It is a forbidden fact for any one country to relax the ban alone, and it is difficult to achieve satisfactory results for any one country to ban smoking if it does not rely on the close cooperation of all countries. Although our country is bound by treaties, the concessions have not yet been recovered, consular jurisdiction has not been abolished, and the situation in North China is complex and the atmosphere of drugs is rampant, the entire plan is being promoted, and we hope to receive assistance from friendly countries; ㊇ Stating the plan and determination for complete eradication, ensuring that the anti-smoking administration is completed by the deadline.</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang's Instructions</p>
<p>Briefly stating that the National Government has designated today, the day that Lin Zexu burned a large amount of opium shipped in by foreign countries at Humen ninety-eight years ago, as Anti-Smoking Commemoration Day, one is to commemorate the determination to completely ban smoking and drugs. Lin Gong said in his memorial on banning opium that if this scourge is not eliminated, there will be no usable soldiers or sufficient supplies in ten years. Therefore, there was the heroic act of burning opium. A certain foreigner said in a foreign newspaper that we never imagined that such a country would have such courageous and capable officials. It can be seen that Lin Gong's greatness was long known, and opium was enough to destroy the country and the race, which is worthy of our admiration. Now, under the leadership of Chief Supervisor Jiang, the anti-smoking campaign has detailed plans, and the work is progressing day by day, month by month, and year by year. The Anti-Smoking Association is working hard and diligently, which is not easy. The chairman just said not to sweep the snow from one's own doorstep and not to care about the frost on others' roofs, which means not to ignore other people's affairs. Everyone should supervise each other, from oneself to one's family, from one's family to one's relatives, and by taking this seriously, we can quickly eliminate opium and drugs, which is the best way to save the country and the nation, and is the happiness of the country and the nation.

<p>[Nanjing] The case of formulating the lyrics of the National Anthem of the Republic of China has been jointly reviewed by the Central Standing Committee and a report has been prepared. It was submitted to the Central Standing Committee for discussion and passage on the 3rd. It was decided to adopt the current Party Anthem as the National Anthem. The text of the Standing Committee's review report is recorded as follows: Regarding the compilation of the National Anthem lyrics, it has been jointly reviewed and agreed that the formation of the National Anthem must have its history. The current Party Anthem is the Premier's instruction. Since the 13th year [of the Republic], it was first used in the National Revolutionary Army, and it has since spread throughout the country. All friendly countries have also become accustomed to using it. If we make a new one now, it will be too artificial. After carefully reading the various drafts selected by the Ministry of Education, although each has its strengths, each also has its weaknesses, which have been signed and annotated by the National Anthem Compilation Research Association. The current Party Anthem has a broad meaning, and all the great foundations of China's founding are contained in the Three Principles of the People. Among them, the word "Our Party" is said by some to refer specifically to this party, which is the reason for proposing to make a new National Anthem. However, the word "Our Party," according to the broad definition, is synonymous with "Our People." The Premier founded the Republic, and it is most appropriate to use his instructions as the National Anthem, so that the people of the whole country can admire him. It is proposed to clearly define that the current Party Anthem shall be the National Anthem. Is this appropriate? Report for approval. (Central News Agency Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<p>London Correspondence</p>
<h3>British Attitude Towards the Spanish Incident (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— (Our Correspondent in Europe) Lieshan</p>
<p>In recent years, whenever international disputes have occurred, the British politicians on Downing Street have undoubtedly been the first to feel a headache. For example, Japan forcibly occupied our Northeast Four Provinces, Germany tore up the Treaty of Versailles and rearmed, and Italy openly ignored British threats and sent troops to occupy Abyssinia. These facts not only greatly damaged the prestige of the British Empire, but even led people to believe that these were signs of the impending collapse of the British Empire. Therefore, when the Spanish incident occurred last year, the British government knew that the figures pulling the strings behind General Franco were Germany and Italy, and they were like startled birds, daring not to openly take sides, lest they bring trouble upon themselves. The establishment of the London "Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War" involved countless efforts and twists and turns by British diplomats. However, this well-intentioned and earnest neutral attitude of Britain has not gained any sympathy from others. In the eyes of Germany and Italy, Britain's neutrality policy is a diplomatic tactic, and Britain has always sympathized with the Spanish People's Front government. In the eyes of France, Russia, and the British opposition parties—the Labour Party and the Liberal Party—the British government's weak policy only serves to boost General Franco's momentum, indirectly "aiding the tyrant." Prime Minister Baldwin, caught in the crossfire, looked like a mute eating bitter herbs.</p>
<p>Is Britain really so indifferent to the Spanish incident and willing to strictly adhere to neutrality? Of course, the reality is not so simple. We know that Britain's current main foreign policy is to maintain the existing international status quo. In other words, it hopes for peace and, under the banner of peace, maintains the interests it has already gained. The Conservative politician Churchill recently said it very bluntly in a speech. He said that war is of no benefit to Britain. In the next war, Britain will only lose and gain nothing, so he opposes war. This insightful statement truly captures the psychology of the average Briton. Secondly, the European balance of power that the British have hoped for for many years has now been quite successful. The power of France and Russia is not below that of Germany and Italy, which allows Britain to stand idly by and not seek trouble again! However, the Spanish incident is ultimately an international affair. Britain wants to strictly adhere to neutrality, but neutrality also has its difficulties.</p>
<p>If only Hitler were helping General Franco, the British would not necessarily be anxious. Germany's desire to gain a foothold in the Mediterranean has no theoretical basis. But with Mussolini added, the situation is completely different. Mussolini's ambition is to make the Mediterranean an Italian inland sea. The British can never sit idly by and watch this happen. Since Abyssinia was occupied by Italy, not only is Egypt already surrounded by Italian forces, but even Malta, the British naval base in the Mediterranean, and Port Said are constantly in danger of being bombed by the Italian Air Force. If General Franco wins the Spanish incident again, the Italian Air Force will be able to use Spanish territory as a detour to attack the Port of Gibraltar. Once the Port of Gibraltar falls, the power of the British Mediterranean fleet will be reduced to zero, and most importantly, the sea transportation between the British mainland and its colonies may be interrupted. From a British military standpoint, it is natural to hope that the "People's Front" government will win. A Socialist-ruled Spain is always more beneficial to Britain than a Spanish Italy under General Franco. If Britain wants to maintain its hegemony in the Mediterranean, it has no reason to watch the collapse of the Spanish "People's Front" government.</p>
<p>In fact, taking the attitude of the general British public towards the Spanish incident, the majority sympathize with the Spanish "People's Front" government. Although the British are a conservative nation, they love democracy and hate dictatorship. The British certainly do not want a left-leaning "People's Front" government in Spain, but since this government was elected by the majority of the people and represents the public will, it is a legitimate government. Overthrowing the government by force, even causing a bloody civil war, is, in the British view, at the very least an immoral act. The British do not love revolution, whether it is a left-wing or right-wing revolution. Therefore, no matter how General Franco propagandizes, calling for the protection of human culture, it is always difficult to win the sympathy of most Britons. In the eyes of the British, he is always a rebellious soldier!</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Labor Strikes and Prices</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>For several months, labor strikes have surged in coastal cities and have not stopped. According to our newspaper's special telegram yesterday, the Changsha textile factory also held a strike due to treatment issues. It is reported that the provincial government has decided to disband the labor union, re-register workers, and severely punish the leaders of the labor strike as a means to resolve the turmoil. Whether this measure is appropriate, we currently do not understand the true nature of the turmoil, so we cannot make reckless judgments. However, from the fact of this Changsha strike, it can be seen that the labor strike has spread from coastal areas to inland provinces. This is something we must not ignore.</p>
<p>The causes of labor strikes may vary, but based on the statistics of the past few months, they are generally threefold: demanding increased wages and improved treatment; reducing working hours; and assisting their unfortunate fellow workers. These three causes, in a nutshell, are only for the sake of their own livelihood security. Is this demand for livelihood security an act that goes beyond the bounds? We must calmly consider whether the cause is genuine. Otherwise, to rashly regard a strike as illegal, without asking whether the motive is pure, and to assume that there must be a hidden agenda, and to adopt decisive measures, I am afraid that not only will the labor strike not be quelled, but society may become even more unstable.</p>
<p>Among the above three causes of labor strikes, reducing working hours and assisting fellow workers are individual issues, and we cannot make general criticisms. As for the demand for improved treatment, we believe that there is considerable justification. In the past six months, the extent of price increases has been truly alarming. Taking the recent price index of various cities across the country, the price in April has increased by 16.6% in Shanghai compared to the same period last year, and 22.59% in North China. As for Hankou and Nanjing, the price in March has increased by 11.4% and 12% respectively compared to the same period last year. In other words, goods that could be purchased for one yuan in the past now cost one yuan and twelve cents. The reverse of this high price is the reduction in "real wages." The monthly income of today's workers is a few yuan for the low end and no more than tens of yuan for the high end. Their expenses are almost all necessary living expenses that cannot be saved. However, today's price increase of 20% has a huge impact on workers. Is it unreasonable for today's workers to demand improved treatment? To be fair, although the method of striking to demand increased wages and improved treatment is debatable, the situation is excusable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, part of the recent price increase is due to the improvement of the economy. But there must also be unreasonable causes. The people in our inland areas are not well-informed and are accustomed to using cash. They are skeptical of bank notes. Therefore, those who have goods are unwilling to exchange them for banknotes unless absolutely necessary. Conversely, those who have banknote income rush to exchange them for goods, creating a decrease in the supply of real goods and an increase in false demand. And ordinary merchants take advantage of this to hoard and speculate, manipulating the market to satisfy their selfish desires. In this way, prices cannot but be high, and labor strikes cannot but occur.</p>
<p>In summary, to eliminate today's labor strikes, the most important thing is to suppress today's prices. And the suppression of prices must start from eliminating the causes of price surges. How to make people believe in banknotes and how to encourage people to save are all fundamental solutions. As for the current temporary solutions, the most important thing is to crack down on merchants who manipulate and hoard.</p>
<h3>Japan Attaches Importance to Diplomacy with China and Russia</h3>
<p>Hirota Resumes Post Like Feng Fu, Drawing Attention from All Sides</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Hirota Koki has formally accepted the position of Foreign Minister. (3rd Central News Agency Electricity)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Hirota Koki's reappointment as Foreign Minister reminds people of the three principles he advocated twenty months ago. Foreigners here are closely watching the future diplomatic policy of the Konoe cabinet, and expressing deep concern about the fact that the Konoe cabinet's diplomatic policy will be very different from Sato's views. However, general observers believe that the change in the situation of the Toa Keizai Chōsakai is especially due to our country's unification and the national unity of the past few years, which do not allow for the forceful implementation of the two principles. Moreover, the Konoe's control within the new cabinet can somewhat avoid the unwise concept of adopting overly harsh diplomatic policies at this time. Although the fact that Hirota is resuming his old post at least indicates that the Konoe cabinet's diplomatic policy attaches importance to China and the Soviet Union.

<h3>Pro-Military Faction Dominates, New Japanese Cabinet Established</h3>
<p>Kaya Appointed Minister of Finance, Hirota in Charge of Foreign Affairs, Strengthening Control Causes Deep Concern in Financial Circles</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The list of cabinet members of the Konoe cabinet has been formally decided on the 3rd. The first cabinet meeting will be held on the morning of the 4th after the imperial appointment ceremony, and opinions will be exchanged on the fundamental policy guidelines. It is generally believed that Prime Minister Konoe will issue a statement on the outline of the policy in the form of a speech. (3rd Allied News)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The work of forming a cabinet has been completed after several twists and turns. It is said that the general outline of its policies will not go beyond the following items: ㊀ Thorough realization of clarifying the national polity and renovating culture and education; ㊁ Establishing an independent and active foreign policy; ㊂ Ensuring financial and industrial policies; ㊃ Implementing policies to stabilize national life; ㊄ Renovating the parliamentary system and amending the election law. To materialize the above policies, it is necessary to further enhance the function of the Planning Board. This is inevitable. And when implementing it, it is necessary to base the entire system on the principle of control. (3rd Allied News)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The new Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, having failed to obtain Kodama's approval to take charge of finance, is now satisfied with the promotion of Kaya Okinori, the former Vice Minister of Finance, to Minister of Finance. According to Konoe's statement to reporters late yesterday, the difficulty in selecting the Minister of Finance was mainly due to the conditions put forward by the military. Although Hirota and Hirao are still in negotiations for the positions of Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Commerce and Industry, respectively, they have actually been decided. If no unexpected events occur, the new cabinet is expected to be established today. From an overall observation, the new cabinet is indeed a so-called national powerful cabinet. However, it is only national and powerful in the sense that the new administrative nature is more militarized and fascistized, because the cabinet includes the most powerful figures from both the Hirota and Hayashi cabinets, as well as two well-known pro-military figures from the established political parties. Baba Eiichi's appointment as Minister of Home Affairs and concurrent President of the Planning Board has caused serious concern in financial circles, who fear that it will adopt more extreme monopolistic policies than the Hayashi cabinet. Therefore, Konoe's reputation in financial circles has been greatly diminished compared to when he was appointed to form the cabinet. The established political parties are also increasingly fearful of being sacrificed by the formation of the new government. In addition to Konoe himself planning to organize a new party long ago, Arima, who had the ambition to agitate for the organization of a new party when the Hayashi cabinet was established, and Nakajima, a tycoon in the Japanese aviation industry and one of the main financial supporters of the Seiyukai, are convinced that they can lead at least 60 to 70 parliamentarians to join the new party. Nagai has also long been rumored to be the leader of the reorganization of the Minseito. As for the new Chief Secretary of the Cabinet, Kazami Akira, although he left the Kokumin Domei last January, he still has influence in the Kokumin Domei and Toho. Given Konoe and Baba's strong pro-military tendencies, as well as the close relationship between Nakajima, Hirao, Arima, and the military industry, the new party led by Konoe will undoubtedly be a pro-military right-wing reform party. However, what is particularly significant is that the new cabinet has been deeply painted with feudalism. (2nd Central News Agency Electricity)</p>
<h3>List of Cabinet Members</h3>
<p>The list of cabinet members decided in Tokyo is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister: Konoe Fumimaro</p>
<p>Foreign Minister: Hirota Koki</p>
<p>Finance Minister: Kaya Okinori</p>
<p>Home Minister: Baba Eiichi</p>

<p>President of the Planning Board: Baba Eiichi (concurrently)</p>
<p>Chief Secretary of the Cabinet: Kazami Akira</p>
<p>Director-General of the Legislation Bureau: Taki Masao (decided) (3rd Allied News)</p>
<h3>Features of the New Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Most of the cabinet members of the Konoe cabinet have been decided. Judging from the figures entering the cabinet, the nature of the new cabinet is such that Baba's concurrent position as Minister of Home Affairs and President of the Planning Board leads one to expect the substantive revival of Baba's finances. Moreover, the Education Minister Yasui, the Agriculture Minister Arima, and the Chief Secretary of the Cabinet Kazami are all distinctive figures. And from the political parties, such giants of the so-called reform faction as Nakajima and Nagai are selected. From this point of view, although the Konoe cabinet is a combination of various factions, it has already embarked on the path of reform, and it is quite obvious that it is taking a step further. Therefore, how the new cabinet will deal with issues such as amending the election law and reforming the parliamentary system, and how the so-called new party movement will develop in the future are issues that should be noted by the general public.

<h3>Brief Biography of the New Finance Minister</h3>
<p>Poverty-Stricken, Hard-Studying, Expert in Finance</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The new Finance Minister Kaya Okinori is from Hiroshima Prefecture and is 49 years old this year. He is considered a vigorous young man among the ministers. He experienced the hardships of hard study in his youth. He graduated from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo University in 1917 and served as a secretary of the Ministry of Finance, head of the Budget Division of the Budget Bureau, and head of the Budget Settlement Division. He is quite skilled in reconstructing the deficit finance. He was promoted to Director of the Budget Bureau in one leap. In September 1936, he was appointed as Director of the Finance Bureau, and in February 1937, he was promoted to Vice Minister of Finance. He was stationed in the United States and served as a member of the Geneva and London Naval Disarmament Conferences. He traveled to Europe and is not interested in anything other than numbers. He is nearly six feet tall and extremely majestic. He often takes painting as his only consolation. He owns a private residence in Nishisugamo, Toshima Ward, Tokyo, and is scheduled to pay in monthly installments to pay off the house in ten years. Recently, he was able to finalize the price of the house. On the other hand, Kaya-style, which often finalized tens of billions of finances in times of emergency, is quite poor himself, which can be seen in general. According to his wife, the professor does not smoke or drink, but likes to play high and rich ball games, and his skills are quite good. He uses this as entertainment in his spare time. As for being a minister, I don't know if his physical strength can withstand it. (3rd Central News Agency Electricity)</p>
<h3>Delegates from Various Countries at the League of Nations Committee Vigorously Criticize Japan's Opium Disaster in China</h3>
<p>Presenting Solid Evidence with Numbers, Japanese Representative Gave Ambiguous Answers</p>
<p>[Geneva] Yesterday, when the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee discussed the Far East issue, the representatives of the United States and Egypt openly denounced Japan's policy of poisoning Manchuria and the provinces of North China. The US representative Fuller claimed that the three northeastern provinces and Rehe are the only regions in the world where the authorities not only do not prevent the trade in drugs, but also monopolize them by the government and profit from them. In 1935, as many as 6,000 people died from opium addiction in a large town in Manchuria, and the government plans to increase opium production by 25% in 1937. The Egyptian representative Russell (note: Russell is British and is recognized as one of the world's greatest authorities on drug trade issues) claimed that 90% of the world's white pills are made by Japanese, and their locations are in Tianjin, Dalian, Shenyang, and various towns in the three northeastern provinces and Rehe, all of which are supervised and manufactured by Japanese. Taking Tianjin alone, as much as 500 kilograms of heroin are shipped abroad every week, 60% of which is directly transported to the United States for sale, and 30% is transshipped to the Americas through European ports. In addition, the opium monopoly agency forces the mortgage of farmland to plant drugs, thereby controlling more and more land and turning local farmers into beggars. After the attacks by the US and Egyptian representatives, the Japanese representative Yokoyama stood up to defend, saying that the Japanese government had recently promulgated three laws to ban opium trade and stipulated fines for Japanese opium traffickers. As for the situation in Tianjin, it is said to be caused by political instability. The opium issue can only be discussed after order is restored there. He continued that Manchuria and Korea have already taken steps to remedy this situation. The Chinese representative, Minister Hu Shize, then took the floor and reported on the measures taken by the Chinese authorities to deal with this issue, declaring that the Chinese government has now established a six-year plan to ban opium, stipulating various penalties for planting, transporting, trafficking, and smoking opium. Currently, opium cultivation has been banned in all but seven provinces, and it will be completely banned in 1940. Only 3,700,000 registered smokers are still allowed to purchase opium, but they have been ordered to quit within a certain period and are now receiving organized treatment. Hu concluded by stating that the Chinese government's strict penalties for banning opium have been extremely effective. Hu's report received high praise from the US representative and representatives from various countries at the meeting. (3rd Guomin Haitong)</p>
<h3>We Did Not Negotiate with Britain for Loans</h3>
<p>China to Adopt Gold Standard, Simon Says No Such Intention</p>
<p>[London] Japanese newspapers have recently issued news that Britain is now working hard to develop economic interests in China, and the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, has drafted a plan to consolidate Britain's economic power in China. Chinese people here do not pay much attention to it, and say that Dr. Kong Xiangxi did not request a loan during his recent stay in London, and the British side did not offer to lend funds to China.

<p>[London] In the House of Commons today, Conservative MP Touhy raised the issue of assisting China in establishing a gold standard. Touhy asked whether, in view of the problems caused by excessive gold production in commerce, and before this excess gold can be naturally absorbed by the expansion of international trade, Finance Minister Simon could consult with the US government to jointly advise China to assist in establishing a gold standard system and issuing gold coins to replace silver coins sold to the United States. Simon replied that China has not yet expressed any intention of establishing a gold standard, and in terms of the environment, this suggestion does not seem practical.

Fondeyne gave a welcoming speech, briefly saying that the association was honored by the presence of Vice President Kong. He then said that the Sino-French Friendship Association was founded by Dubail, the former French Minister to China, thirty years ago. Its purpose is to promote friendship and cultural relations between China and France. Since its establishment, it has received more than 2,000 Chinese students at the association. "These students will surely promote the existing relations between China and France after returning to their country," he said. Dr. Kong Xiangxi then replied, saying that the Sino-French Friendship Association's efforts to develop relations between China and France were commendable. He also said that China has learned from France and the United States to establish a democratic political system. Since the beginning of the 20th century to the present, it has created a young country and adopted the spirit of modernization. "However, we still have to wait for the cooperation of all countries, especially the cooperation of France." Finally, he said that the friendship between China and France has been strong for a long time, and he hopes that it will become closer day by day. Afterwards, a Chinese student explained the purpose of the Sino-French Friendship Association and its achievements, and said that Vice President Pratt's love and care for Chinese students was like a father and brother treating their children, which he was particularly grateful for. Dr. Kong Xiangxi talked with several Chinese students for a while and then went to the US Embassy to attend Ambassador Biddle's banquet. (2nd Central News Agency Havas Electricity)</p>

<h3>Spanish Issue: Britain Proposes to France, Germany, and Italy</h3>
<p>Emphasizing Withdrawal of Combatants and Security Monitoring; Negotiations are Generally Smooth, but Procedures Face Difficulties</p>
<p>[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden has reportedly announced today to key representatives of the Imperial Conference that Britain has proposed three measures to France, Germany, and Italy, to encourage Germany and Italy to return to cooperation with the Non-Intervention Committee. The three measures are said to be: ㊀ expanding the security zone on the Spanish sea, with warships from monitoring countries stationed; ㊁ ensuring the protection of monitoring warships if they are attacked; ㊂ if incidents occur in the future, the commanders of the monitoring fleets of various countries will consult on how to respond. It is also reported that Foreign Secretary Eden is quite optimistic about the situation today, saying that the European situation has greatly eased in recent days, and Britain is striving for Germany and Italy to return to the Non-Intervention Committee as soon as possible. It is reported that the French government has agreed to the British proposal. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>[London] The document sent today to the governments of the Non-Intervention Committee countries contains a proposal to guarantee that the monitoring warships of the Non-Intervention Committee in Spanish territorial waters will not be attacked. When Foreign Secretary Eden announced this matter in the House of Commons today, he said that the British government believes that the most important goal today is international cooperation and the safe restoration of maritime monitoring, without causing delays. Furthermore, the British government attaches importance to this proposal, especially to ensure that the withdrawal of foreign combatants can make rapid progress, as the current situation is extremely urgent. (Reuters from Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>[London] The situation arising from the withdrawal of Germany and Italy from the Adjustment Committee and their cessation of participation in the Spanish maritime monitoring work has now been largely resolved. Expanding the monitoring zone to include all Spanish ports has been agreed upon in principle. However, the issue of joint punishment for the warships of participating monitoring countries in the event of an attack has not been resolved quickly due to various major technical difficulties. According to sources from the British government, the British government intends to raise issues with the governments of France, Germany, and Italy, requesting each to propose concrete measures to guarantee the safety of the warships of participating monitoring countries. The most important of the so-called technical difficulties are the following: The principle of mutual assistance among the naval fleets of participating monitoring countries would make the participating naval fleets international in nature. According to this principle, foreign inspectors must be assigned to supervise the actions of each warship, so that neither side of the Spanish Civil War can use it as an excuse to attack the monitoring warships. However, the British Admiralty does not allow foreign inspectors to board British warships, which is one difficulty. Expanding the security zone and allowing participating monitoring warships to dock at Spanish ports requires the permission of both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War. However, once this method is implemented, warships that have always sided with one party in the civil war must be warned not to use the convenience of docking at the ports of their friends in the civil war to report news to their allies, which is another difficulty. When a participating monitoring warship is attacked by any party in the Spanish Civil War, warships from various countries should impose collective punishment on the attacker. This method is the most difficult because if such collective punishment occurs, the responsibility will naturally be borne jointly by the warships and governments of various countries, which will inevitably cause various political and technical difficulties. Most members of the British Cabinet believe that this plan would involve Britain too deeply in the Spanish Civil War, and the cooperation of the fleets of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy would be tantamount to establishing a four-nation treaty, which most members of the British Cabinet cannot support, which is a third difficulty. Moreover, the method of collective punishment is unlikely to be implemented, as countries sympathetic to one side of the civil war are unlikely to impose punishment on a friendly party, which is a fourth difficulty.

<h3>Britain and France Court the United States to Stabilize the European Situation</h3>
<p>The Relationship Begins to Take Effect; the US Temporarily Does Not Implement the Neutrality Law</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the withdrawal of Germany and Italy from the Adjustment Committee, newspapers here have continued to comment on it. Among them, L'Intransigeant reported, "After the Almeria Port incident, the British and French governments immediately requested the United States to come forward to help prevent this incident from becoming a European tragedy. President Roosevelt also replied that the US government intends to implement the Neutrality Law to sanction aggressive countries. Based on this, the relationship of unity between the three major democratic countries of Britain, France, and the United States has begun to take effect and cannot be underestimated." (Havas from Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the German warship's shelling of the Spanish port of Almeria, a strong movement has emerged in the United States, advocating that if Germany and Italy do not rejoin the non-intervention policy, the United States should sanction them with the Neutrality Law. Although this movement was initiated by Senator Borah, most Americans still advocate avoiding getting involved in the vortex. The US government is unlikely to consider this at present. However, if the situation deteriorates further, the US may reconsider its response. Regarding this, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declared yesterday that the committee does not intend to ask President Roosevelt to implement the Neutrality Law to avoid jeopardizing the peaceful situation. In addition, President Roosevelt has returned to Washington after his vacation and will discuss the Spanish situation with Secretary of State Hull. The attitude that the US government may adopt at that time can be determined. Political figures believe that it would be very dangerous for the United States to simultaneously implement the Neutrality Law for Germany, Italy, and Spain under the current circumstances. (Havas from Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>[New York] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a closed-door meeting today to discuss the issue of US neutrality. After the meeting, Chairman Pittman stated that we cannot take any action to support the movement to localize the Spanish war. If we intervene, it will hinder the plan of the Non-Intervention Committee and endanger our own peace. The proposal put forward by Republican Senator Nye that since Germany and Italy have effectively joined the Spanish war, the US Neutrality Law should be immediately applied to Germany and Italy was not discussed by the Foreign Relations Committee today.

<h3>Important Figures from Germany and Italy Hold Lengthy Talks</h3>
<p>Neurath Will Travel Abroad</p>
<p>[Rome] Prime Minister Mussolini and German Defense Minister General von Blomberg held talks at the Palazzo Venezia at 6 p.m., which lasted for a considerable time. According to responsible sources, the two discussed the issue of the Berlin-Rome political axis jointly dealing with the Spanish situation militarily, and discussed the chances of victory for the Spanish Nationalist forces from a technical point of view. Responsible sources also declared that although the number of Germans participating in the war in Spain is not as large as that of the Italians, and in fact Germany only provides the Spanish Nationalist forces with ammunition, supplies, and technical personnel, without formal troops participating, the military cooperation between Germany and Italy can be tested in the Spanish Civil War. (Havas from Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Political figures have declared that Foreign Minister von Neurath is scheduled to visit the capitals of Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria next week. The purpose of this trip is to promote friendly relations between Germany and these countries and to enhance peace in the Balkans. As for the rapprochement between Italy and Yugoslavia, Germany approves of it, but Neurath's visit to Yugoslavia has nothing to do with Defense Minister General von Blomberg's visit to Italy.

<h3>British-German Relations</h3>
<p>Henderson's Speech: Please Understand Each Other</p>
<p>[London] Newspapers here are paying close attention to the speech given by the new British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, at the "British-German Association" banquet in Berlin yesterday, believing that the speech shows that British-German relations have made progress. Henderson stated in his speech that much of the world's unease is caused by incomplete understanding. "For example, most British people often have a misunderstanding of the true meaning of the National Socialist system; otherwise, they would not attach so much importance to the National Socialist dictatorship and the social experiments promoted by Germany, which is regrettable. This is because these British people only see some crooked trees and do not see the merits of building the entire forest." He also said that Germany's misunderstanding of Britain is also the same. Based on what he has seen and heard in Germany for several weeks, he has heard some German remarks saying that Britain is trying to restrict Germany's natural development in all aspects. Henderson stated, "I guarantee that this is absolutely not the case. We have always admired Germany's contribution to the world, and we admire German culture, philosophy, theory, industry, commerce, and the thoroughness and courage of the German people. Germany's fatal problem at this time is the raw material problem. Regarding this, I believe that Germany cannot find a country more suitable and helpful to Germany than Britain, because London has a long financial experience in this regard and is ready to discuss and resolve difficulties with other countries at any time." The British Ambassador concluded by declaring that three weeks ago, he sincerely told Führer Hitler, "Please give us a guarantee of peace and promote peace in Europe, and Germany will have no more sincere and helpful ally in the world than Britain." After Standard Evening News recorded this passage, it said that the new British Cabinet has a very strong atmosphere for rapprochement with Germany, and British-German relations will see accelerated progress.

Both ceremonies were completed at 2:03 p.m. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>The bride and groom knelt before the altar on cushions made of white silk. The altar was made of old nanmu wood, covered with a velvet embroidered tablecloth, and adorned with a silver cross and two silver vases filled with lilies. The civil ceremony was extremely simple, taking place at 11:35 a.m. The mayor simply read the names of the bride and groom, with Major Metcalfe and Mr. Rogers acting as witnesses for the bride and groom. He then read three relevant articles of the civil code. The mayor asked the Duke of Windsor, "Do you take Mrs. Warfield to be your wife?" The Duke resolutely replied "Yes." However, when asked of Mrs. Warfield, the bride's voice trembled slightly. The civil ceremony ended at 11:47 a.m., with the mayor declaring, "In the name of the law, I now pronounce you husband and wife." Afterwards, the mayor gave eulogies to both the Duke and his bride. The entire city outside the Château de Candé was decorated with flags to celebrate the event. To prevent aircraft from flying over the Château de Candé during the wedding, the government dispatched two fighter jets to guard the vicinity. French Prime Minister Blum sent a basket of flowers, which arrived at the end of the wedding. After the wedding, the bride and groom slowly entered the reception room, received congratulations from the guests, and posed for photos with reporters. (Reuters from Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>

<h3>World Women's Christian Temperance Union Convention</h3>
<p>Held in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>[Washington] The 17th convention of the World Women's Christian Temperance Union was held in Washington today, with over 3,000 participants, all women leaders from various countries. The Chinese Women's Christian Temperance Union originally nominated Ms. Wu Laowei and Ms. Liu Wang Liming to attend, but Ms. Wu and Ms. Liu could not leave the country due to official duties, so they selected Ms. Shen Yixiang, President of the Ningbo Women's Christian Temperance Union, and Ms. Bu Lanniu as representatives. The convention will last for five days. In addition to the representatives reporting on the affairs of their respective countries, the main purpose of the convention is to promote the temperance movement, abolish prostitution, and stop war. Many ambassadors and their wives from various countries participated. President Roosevelt will also attend the meeting to give a speech on peace. The World Women's Christian Temperance Union was founded in 1883 and currently has millions of members, with organizations in over 50 countries. The most perfect and successful organizations in the East are China and Japan. The Japanese organization is called the "Women's Moral Reform Association," and its main work is to ban alcohol and abolish prostitution. The Chinese Women's Christian Temperance Union was launched at Chongshi Girls' School on Binggai Mountain in Zhenjiang. This movement has now spread throughout the country, with over 100,000 members, including students. The first president was Dr. Shi Meiyu, and the current leader is Ms. Wang Liming, wife of Liu Zhanen, president of Shanghai University. Its purpose is to ban smoking, alcohol, gambling, and evil, improve family life, and promote social undertakings. Practical affairs that have been initiated include the Shanghai Women and Children's Education and Welfare Home, the Shanghai Women's Apartments, the Chinese Women's Advanced Vocational School for Home Affairs, and the Chinese Women's Production Cooperative, etc. (Telegram, 1st)</p>

<h3>Pacific Pact Proposal</h3>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Proposes Supplementary Opinions; British Government Carefully Studies</p>
<p>[London] At today's meeting of the Imperial Conference, Australian Prime Minister Lyons greatly supplemented his original proposal for the Pacific Pact, making it complete and without flaws. The Australian delegation was quite pleased because the attendees welcomed Lyons' suggestions. The Australian delegation believes that the Pacific Ocean will be more important in future international affairs than it is today, and believes that other autonomous territories have the same view. Therefore, it now feels that the time has come to unanimously strive to guarantee peace in the Pacific Ocean. Although Lyons was informed that there are many difficulties in the way of implementing his plan, he did not lose his determination to promote the plan. It is rumored that Tokyo may soon be the venue for a meeting of Pacific powers. Public opinion believes that this statement is purely speculation. At today's meeting of the Imperial Conference, the overall situation in the Pacific and Far East was discussed. Lyons spoke first, and many other representatives also spoke. The Australian delegation distributed a rich document to each representative, which contained several concrete suggestions for the Pacific Pact. Although this move has made good progress at present, it should be noted that the organization of the Imperial Conference is not the Imperial Cabinet. Therefore, the current discussion is only a review. After the close of the conference, the British government and the governments of various autonomous territories must carefully study this proposal. It will probably not be completed in a short time, so no hasty decision can be made in the near future. (Reuters from Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>[London] The British Imperial Conference continued to meet today to discuss the proposal put forward by Australian Federal Prime Minister Lyons for the Pacific countries to conclude a non-aggression pact, but the discussion did not result in any decision. Lyons made a speech at today's meeting, saying, "What the Australian Federation hopes for most is the establishment of a Pacific regional agreement. This agreement should not be based on bilateral consultations, but on the principles of the League of Nations. All countries along the Pacific coast should guarantee each other and not infringe on each other, so that the situation in the Pacific can tend to be relaxed. If Japan and the United States, which are not members of the League of Nations, can cooperate with other countries through the Pacific regional agreement, the entire international situation will be greatly improved."

<h3>Tianjin-Tokyo Air Route Opens</h3>
<p>Japan Takes Tokyo as the Aviation Center and Simultaneously Launches Routes to Changchun and Taiwan</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The direct air route between Tianjin and Tokyo, jointly operated by Huitong Aviation Company and Greater Japan Air Transport Co., Ltd., was implemented on the 1st of this month. Flights took off from both places simultaneously. The departure time from Tianjin was 6:10 a.m. on the 1st of this month. Ticket sales began several days earlier. As of the 30th of last month, a total of eight tickets had been sold. Only one of them was purchased by Mr. Duzuka, the owner of a foreign firm on Daodong Street in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, for a direct flight from Tianjin to Tokyo. Among the remaining seven people, three were Chinese and four were Japanese. Two were going to Gyeongseong, Korea, and five were going to Dalian. At around 5 a.m. on the morning of the 1st, Mr. Tokudome, Director of the General Affairs Section, and Mr. Okabe, Director of the Air Navigation Section, led key members of Huitong Company to the Limingzhuang Airport in the eastern suburbs to prepare. After the passengers were transported to the airport by the company's cars, a simple picnic was held first, and several cups of wine were raised to celebrate the opening of the air route. Then, the passengers boarded the plane one after another and took off on time. The Japanese people on the scene were all cheering, as something they had dreamed of for a long time was now realized. Mr. Zhang Zizhong, Chairman of Huitong Company, attached a congratulatory letter to the Mayor of Tokyo on the opening of the air route, along with six goldfish to express his joy. The aircraft was Huitong Company's newly manufactured Nakajima-type A.T. eight-seat fast aircraft, the "Beiping" (Peiping) . At 8:30 a.m. that morning, it arrived in Dalian. Passengers changed to a Greater Japan Air Transport Co., Ltd. aircraft and continued to take off, arriving in Tokyo at 5:10 p.m. The aircraft flying from Tokyo took off at 7:20 a.m. on the 1st, arrived in Dalian, and changed to the Huitong "Tianjin" aircraft with eight seats to come to Tianjin. At 4:10 p.m., it landed at Limingzhuang Airport. Executives of Huitong were all at the airport to welcome them. Those who came from Tokyo on the same flight that day were Mr. Goto, a reporter from Osaka Mainichi, and Mr. Ishio, a reporter from Osaka Asahi. There were also two Japanese who had transferred from Dalian. The Mayor of Tokyo sent a congratulatory letter to Mr. Zhang Zizhong, along with several dried fish, a specialty of Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. The air route was thus completed. It has now been decided to fly three times a week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Fares are set at four levels: ㊀ Tianjin to Dalian: 52 yuan; ㊁ Tianjin to Gyeongseong: 102 yuan; ㊂ Tianjin to Fukuoka: 142 yuan; ㊃ Tianjin to Tokyo: 207 yuan. The above are all based on Japanese yen. The layover times along the way are as follows: those going from Tianjin to Tokyo take off at 6:10 a.m., arrive in Dalian at 8:30 a.m., arrive in Gyeongseong at 10:45 a.m., arrive in Fukuoka at 1:00 p.m., and arrive in Tokyo at 5:10 p.m.; those coming from Tokyo to Tianjin take off at 7:20 a.m., arrive in Fukuoka at 11:00 a.m., arrive in Gyeongseong at 1:15 p.m., arrive in Dalian at 3:30 p.m., and arrive in Tianjin at 4:10 p.m. The distance between the two places is 2,400 kilometers, and it only takes 10 hours to reach. One thing that is worth studying on the day of the opening is that Japan is taking Tokyo as the center, and the aviation to Changchun and Taiwan is also starting at the same time. All routes only take 10 hours to reach each day. It is not known whether it has the intention of completing an aviation network and placing our North China in a semi-colonial state. The Ministry of Communications has recently denied this move and has sent a telegram to stop it. In addition, the company's planned direct air route from Peiping (Beijing) to Tianjin to Beidaihe is planned to fly twice or three times a week and is scheduled to be implemented on the 15th of this month. Currently, everything is being prepared. (1st)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Will Abolish Production and Sales Taxes</h3>
<p>The People Are Extremely Painful About the Production and Sales Taxes; The Department of Finance Has Already Drafted Ways to Offset</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Jiangxi Provincial Government established the bandit suppression and post-disaster production and sales taxes in the 21st year of the Republic (1932). All items exported and imported in the province were taxed in three categories: ㊀ Luxury goods were taxed at 12.5% to 17.5% of the value; ㊁ Semi-luxury goods were taxed at 7.5% to 10% of the value; ㊂ Daily necessities were taxed at 2.5% to 5% of the value. Collection offices were established in Nanchang and Jiujiang, and inspection offices were established in other major ports. In the 21st year of the Republic, the total revenue was over 2,150,000 yuan. In the 22nd year of the Republic, it was over 2,167,000 yuan. At that time, all sectors considered this tax to be a disguised likin and telegraphed to the central government to request a clear order to abolish it. The Ministry of Finance also believed that the tax was in conflict with the central government's clear order to abolish all miscellaneous taxes and not increase the burden on the people in any name, and repeatedly telegraphed to stop the collection. However, the provincial authorities believed that the funds for the bandit suppression and post-disaster work were not available, and the salaries and rations of the 20 security regiments were also impossible to raise. The tax was still collected. Only after the disaster, the production fell, and the export of specialties was dying. The production tax was abolished, and only the import sales tax was collected, but the ratio increased instead of decreased. In the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic, the sales tax revenue was around 2 million yuan. In the 25th year of the Republic, Peng Chengwan was ordered to collect 2 million yuan. The officials of the bureaus and offices, because there were bonuses to be distributed, and for various reasons, arbitrarily valued imported goods, turned boxes and overturned baskets, and were extremely harsh. The merchants were in great pain. However, the merchants passed on the taxes they bore to the people, thereby increasing prices and greatly affecting the people's livelihood. The voice of opposition spread throughout the province. In order to ease the external atmosphere, Wen Qun, the director of the Department of Finance, proposed the abolition of the sales tax after taking office. The proposed offsetting measures are: ㊀ Request the central government to subsidize 1.2 million yuan annually; ㊁ Subsidize from the surplus of the reorganized land tax (i.e., land value tax). Because the land tax in the province is calculated at more than 9 million yuan, only 60% to 70% can be collected. After the use of aerial surveying and registration to change the collection to land value tax, there is no omission. The tax revenue has increased. Nanchang City alone can collect more than 400,000 yuan. Now the land tax in various counties can be changed to land value tax in turn, and the land tax can be collected to more than 10 million yuan in the future. It is heard that the central government has decided to abolish this illegal sales tax from next year, but the Department of Finance strongly requests the central government to give appropriate subsidies to avoid affecting the budget.</p>

Regarding local undertakings, he plans to start with bandit suppression. Since taking office, he has dispatched troops to suppress scattered bandits, aiming for a thorough eradication in the short term. He has also invited local heads of various agencies and gentry to a luncheon to consult on bandit suppression plans.</p>
<p>On the 25th, Director Shangguan, accompanied by Commissioner Yang, Chief of Staff Zhang Xiangbao, Chief of the First Section of the Adjutant's Office Liu Runshan, and others, went to Laohekou for inspection. They arrived in Laohekou at 9:00 AM that morning. Representatives from local agencies were sent to the station to welcome them. Slogans were posted along the streets to express enthusiastic support. Director Shangguan expressed his gratitude for the grand welcome from all sectors but declined all banquets. He then met with Division Commander Liu to provide instructions on bandit suppression strategies. He also gave a speech to the officers and soldiers of the 40th Division, encouraging them to work hard in bandit suppression. He then went with Division Commander Liu and others to Gucheng to give a speech to the officers and soldiers of the 35th Brigade. It is reported that Director Shangguan greatly commended the efforts of the troops stationed in various places in suppressing bandits. He returned to Xiangyang in the afternoon. When crossing the He Kou River, he also inspected the river embankment with Commissioner Yang and others.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Holding Wheat Crop Competition</p>
<p>In order to promote improved wheat varieties and stimulate competition among farmers, the County Government held a wheat crop competition at the Xu Gongqiao Agricultural Education Center on the 1st. More than 100 farmers participated. A review meeting was held on the 2nd, with the main points divided into field inspection and indoor examination. There were five varieties: Cai Zi Huang, Chang Shui Hong, Wujin Wumang, Jinling No. 26, and Jian Zi Duan. It is estimated that the review will be completed in about three days, and prizes will be awarded to the best performers.</p>
<p>Businesses Urge Tax Exemption</p>
<p>Recently, the county's Business Tax Bureau dispatched personnel to review the account books of various businesses to estimate and determine the tax amount. Businessmen, citing various difficulties and the inability to pay the increased tax amount, have appealed to the Chamber of Commerce for relief. On the morning of the 2nd, more than 60 businessmen petitioned the Party and government agencies, sending representatives to state the factual difficulties and request relief.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Adding Vehicles to the Xi-Hu Line</p>
<p>The Xi-Hu Motor Company has been thriving. Since last month, it has increased the number of trips on all lines. Approximately from 7:00 AM, a bus is dispatched every hour. However, only one vehicle is used for each trip, causing severe overcrowding and discomfort for passengers. Upon learning of this, the Shanghai headquarters sent manager Zhu Kaichou and Wu Zhongyi from the transportation department to Changshu on the 2nd to inspect the Changshu-Suzhou and Xichang lines with inspectors along the way. They investigated the actual situation at each station and planned to add a vehicle to each trip. Larger stations will have station buildings added to store vehicles and install telephones for easier communication and dispatch.</p>
<p>Further News on Power Plant Purchasing Electricity</p>
<p>Regarding reports that the local electrical company will purchase electricity from Suzhou or Qishuyan plants, the company issued a letter to various newspapers denying this. However, the Suzhou Electricity Company announced the day before yesterday that Changshu, Kunshan, Wujiang, and other power plants had successively contacted the company to negotiate power supply. The reason is that small civil-police power plants are no longer allowed to add generators. If expansion is needed, they have to seek help from neighboring counties. The reason why the local power plant strongly denies this is that it still intends to add its own generators for expansion, fearing that the Construction Committee will not allow it. They secretly contacted Xichang for negotiation. Once it is announced, they fear being criticized by the Construction Committee, so they made this statement. In fact, contacting Suqi for electricity purchase is indeed a fact.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Cocoon Merchants Raise Prices to Compete for Purchases</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the cocoon market opening in the four rural areas of this county. Seeing that the supply of goods was not abundant, various cocoon merchants raised prices to compete for purchases. However, the general public was still waiting to see, waiting for a good price to sell. In the urban area, the highest price was 62-63 yuan per dan, and the lowest price was also 54-55 yuan. In the Dongting and Yanting villages of the East Road Second District, where there were more goods, the highest price was only over 60 yuan per dan. Due to the small amount of goods arriving at Yuchangxiang and Yuyuan cocoon merchants in Zhouxinzhen of the South Road Third District, the price per dan was raised to over 70 yuan. The price in Rongxiang and Shitang of the West Road was also around 55-56. Few goods arrived at Renchang and Qianzhou Chengchang cocoon merchants in Luoshe of the North Road, and the prices were all around 60, with an upward trend. Because most villagers there are zero-baking, only a few cocoon merchants lowered the price due to seeing a large amount of goods. Overall, the prices of cocoons in all roads yesterday only rose and did not fall. Although there was competition for purchases, the supply of goods was as rare as stars.</p>
<h3>Tragedy at Flour Mill Construction in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Yang Shuxi and other local gentry raised funds to establish a small flour mill in the Guangqin District, named Guangji. Liu Hongji Construction Factory was contracted to build the mill in April of this year, and construction is currently underway. At around 9:00 AM on the 3rd, while the workers were working, the wooden materials of the factory suddenly collapsed. Seeing the situation was bad, the workers immediately stopped working and fled. However, Liu XueLi, Gao Jinsheng, Zai Asan, and four others were unable to escape, resulting in serious injuries to their waists, heads, and other parts of their bodies. The supervisors and workers carried them to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Although the injuries of Liu and Gao were serious, they could still be saved. However, Zai Asan's head was severely injured and lost too much blood, and his life was in critical danger.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Spring Cocoons Expected to Reach 50 Yuan</p>
<p>The various cocoon merchants in the four villages of Wu County uniformly opened their scales on the 2nd, but the arrival of goods was not crowded. Only seven cocoon merchants, including Donghenglin Laogonghe and Yizhong, received more than ten dan each, with a pulled price of around 50 yuan. Xie Tongyi Firm in Qishuyan received more than 30 dan, with a pulled price of 47 yuan and 5 jiao. Yongda Firm in Yachapu received more than 60 dan, with a pulled price of 47 yuan. Henghe and other firms in Hutangqiao received more than 100 dan, with a pulled price of 46 yuan. Yonghe and other firms in Lijiaqiao also received more than 100 dan, with a pulled price of 50 yuan. The silkworm cocoon merchants outside Dabeipu only received more than ten dan, with prices ranging from 36-37 yuan to over 40 yuan. It rained on the morning of the 3rd, and the arrival of goods was still not vigorous. Each firm released the market to receive goods in the afternoon, which could be crowded. However, this year's fresh cocoon prices are unprecedented in recent years. Farmers with good harvests are overjoyed.</p>

Each policeman has also been transferred separately.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Removed from Office for Embezzlement of Public Funds</p>
<p>Zhou Xinwan, the magistrate of Jiangshan County, was recently accused of corruption and dereliction of duty. After an investigation by the Department of Civil Affairs, Shen Bingchen was immediately dispatched with secret orders to remove the county magistrate from office and send him to the province. Shen temporarily replaced the county magistrate. Zhou Xinwan has been sent to the High Court by the Provincial Government and transferred to the Local Court for interrogation. After the trial, Zhou requested bail, which was denied, and he was detained in the detention center pending further action. It is reported that the most obvious case of Zhou's corruption was the private deposit of more than 20,000 yuan of public funds in the Qu County Qianzhuang in his personal name, and the inflated construction costs of bunkers, house numbers, and city blocks, which were extremely large.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>

<h3>Pseudo-Bandits in Chahar North Collapse, While a Certain Party Still Actively Manipulates</h3>
<p>Special Agents Active Separately; Jiabu Temple Schedules Another Meeting; Chang Ziyi Still Clashes with Pseudo-Army</p>
<p>Zhang Zhao Correspondence: The pseudo-bandits in Chahar North are showing a trend of collapse and disintegration due to complex internal factors and conflicting views. Considering the current unstable situation, a certain party is doing its best to appease the rebellious leaders, encouraging them to continue to work hard. On the other hand, they are providing further instructions to the guiding officers sent to serve in various departments on how to manipulate the pseudo-bandit soldiers, hoping to maintain the established status quo of Chahar North. In recent days, all the guiding officers of a certain party in the various armies have been speaking to the soldiers, falsely claiming that the Chinese side has made sufficient preparations in North China and will be detrimental to their jobs. They are recklessly encouraging the soldiers to diligently learn tactics and step up training. The special agency stationed in Jiabu Temple has scheduled a pseudo-Mongolian security meeting to be held at the temple on June 5. The guiding officers of a certain party in the security teams of various counties will attend the temple to jointly discuss future manipulation methods and training matters. Zhang Bei Special Agency Chief ××, accompanied by a certain person from the pseudo-Chahar League Public Office, went to Jiabu Temple by car on the morning of the 31st to have important discussions with De Wang, Li Shouxin, and a certain special agency chief. It is reported that it is related to dealing with Chang Ziyi's mutiny troops. Wu Hueling took a plane from Jiabu Temple to Chengde on the 30th of this month, carrying De Wang's order, to visit a certain brigade commander and present a memorial. He flew back to Jiabu Temple on the 31st. In addition, regarding the news of Chang Ziyi's troops, no new news has been received except that the pseudo-army Bao Zichen Division dispatched a unit from Zhangbei to Duolun on the 30th to assist in the attack. As of the evening of the 31st, they were still under siege by the pseudo-army. It will probably be clear in a few days.</p>
<p>The ×× Army's Second Regiment, which arrived in Guyuan at the beginning of May, has now sent a unit to Jiabu Temple, and soon the entire regiment will also be stationed in the Jiabu Temple Shangdu area. The pseudo-Mongolian government will also establish a high-level intelligence agency, in which the intelligence personnel will be employed by unemployed youths from Shanxi and Hebei provinces with some military knowledge. Among them, there are also several women. It is reported that the scope of their work is limited to Suiyuan, Datong, Zhangjiakou, and the Tianjin-Beijing area, with the aim of spying on our military and political situation. The nature is roughly similar to the intelligence agency in Chengde. (May 31st)</p>
<h3>Reminiscences of the Dian Journey (21)</h3>
<p>— A Glimpse</p>
<p>On the 45th day (May 19th), Vice Commander Bai Jiansheng gave a speech at the Lequn Society on the "Three Allegories Policy": ㊀ Enriching soldiers in the regiment originated from Guanzi's method of governing Qi, "making internal affairs rely on military orders." Its motivation in our country is second only to the trial of conscription, but both have no results. Only by starting with the people's regiment can the regiment soldiers be integrated with the people. Bai repeatedly stated that the current "mercenary system" absolutely cannot fight. No country in the world does not implement conscription. Speaking of the people's regiment, he considered the people's occupations and livelihoods. Guangxi uses agricultural gaps to teach martial arts. The cities are trained in spring and summer, and the farmers are trained in autumn and winter, each for a period of four months (the second call-up is for three months). There are seven months of training, and the new recruit education can be completed. Twenty "regimental districts" are set up throughout the province to handle matters such as call-up, training, and demobilization management. Originally, the responsibility for public training rested with the Party headquarters, but because the current Party headquarters only do personnel work and cannot directly reach the public, the organization of this people's regiment is based on Sun Yat-sen's legacy of awakening the people, training the people, and organizing the people. The June 1 anti-Japanese movement last year summoned more than 300,000 people within three weeks. He is confident that as a result of this training, the teams in the province have the certainty of being "summoned and coming" and the guarantee of being "released and returning" this summer when handling demobilization. ㊁ Embedding generals in learning, requiring the 24,000 primary schools (primary schools) and 2,000 central schools (high schools) in Guangxi to implement military training by military law, and then transfer to middle schools, which also have military training, and then enter officer classes, so that the village chiefs also serve as principals and team leaders. ㊂ Embedding conscription in recruitment, simultaneously advancing conscription and the people's regiment from the 24th year. Conscription has now been carried out to the third phase. The military training expenses are about 5-600,000 yuan per year. At present, a part of the veterans are being processed, and after that, the Fifth Route Army will uniformly and permanently adopt a conscription system, which will be fully completed in the 19th year. Bai's speech was eloquent, lively, and often humorous, so the audience could forget their fatigue. Then Commander-in-Chief Li Delin invited the reporters to the headquarters to meet. Li was frugal. Only guards were seen at the door of the training department, and no one else. In the living room, only a waiter poured tea, and no aides or attendants were seen. Li's words were very sincere, and he answered all kinds of questions sincerely. Here is a summary of it: ㊀ Guangxi's total income is about 20 million yuan, and military and political expenses are allocated in half. Revenue and expenditure are barely sufficient. Guangxi has always been a province receiving assistance. Now the central government allocates assistance on time without any errors. ㊁ Guangxi is now paying attention to eliminating corruption, and Chairman Huang and Vice Commander Bai often go to various places to get close to the people. Although corruption has not been completely eliminated, progress is indeed being made. Any people in Guangxi can directly call the provincial government if they have something to do, so that the situation below cannot reach the top. ㊂ Various separate regulations in Guangxi are often changed due to inconvenience in implementation or the occurrence of malpractices. Some are changed more than ten times before they can be promoted. Colleagues only seek to maximize benefits and do not care about authority. ㊃ Regarding the prohibition of smoking, it will be thoroughly done from the second half of the year. Gambling will also be reduced year by year in order to be completely eliminated. ㊄ The talents from the province's schools are assigned their jobs, and they will not be unemployed unless they make mistakes. However, in poor provinces, the treatment of civil servants is not good. Then, Wei Yongcheng, the director of political training, accompanied us to visit "Diecai Mountain," commonly known as "Gui Mountain." It is where Changshu Qu Zhongxuan and Jiangling Zhang Zhonglie of the late Ming Dynasty became benevolent. There is a "Wind Cave" behind the mountain, and many stone walls are inscribed by famous people of past dynasties. Nearby are Shimen Cave, Qizhen Cave, and Xia Cave, which are all connected. It was when He Shipu, the governor of the Ming Dynasty Tianqi period, led his troops to quell the Qian chiefs and pursued and suppressed them here, occupied their nests, captured and killed 4,000, and captured 50,000. There is a stele to prove it. The mountain is now used as a city defense fortress.</p>
<p>After lunch in the "Wind Cave," the group crossed the Lijiang floating bridge to Dongzhou. First, they went to "Putuo Peak" and then entered "Seven Star Rock." In the cave, there was a guide who led people, holding torches and lanterns to welcome them. The group entered in six groups, and the guides explained along the way. It was like a poet traveling in hell. The cave is two li deep, divided into two roads. The stalactites and stone pillars are shaped like fish, birds, people, flowers, fruits, and trees. Because of the guides' reports and imitative explanations, there are many theocratic and unscientific words, so they have to be discarded. Only the twists and turns and the depth of the cave and the hour we walked are like the lower layer of "Shanjuan Cave" in Yixing and "Water Cave" in Pan County. (Xu Xiake entered Qixingyan from the South Cave (Qixia) and exited from the East Cave (Zeng Gong), and Hu Shi entered Qixingyan from the East Cave and exited from the South Cave.) After exiting the cave, the group arrived at the riverside, the foot of the seventh peak of Qixing Mountain, named "Longyin Rock." There are many stone carvings on the left and right sides of the cave entrance, including the Pingman Stele of the Song Dynasty's Di Qing defeating Nong Zhigao, which is worth seeing. The rear hall of the nunnery in front is also in the cave. The "Yuanyou Party Stele" is inscribed on the top of the cave, and the names of the Su brothers and Qin Shaoyou can still be seen, which is rare. A lover had a copy of it, and Tang Xian Zhang Jun and Song Xian Mi Fu also had Longyin Rock poems inscribed on the stone. Leaving "Longyin," the group walked along the foot of the mountain to "Yueya Mountain." The mountain is shaped like a crescent moon, and a peak rises like a sword. Halfway up the mountain is "Diquan," which is clear, cool, sweet, and moist. Below is "Huahua Bridge," which has two holes for flowing, and five holes are dry. During heavy rains, all seven holes are submerged. After returning to the inn, the group went to "Duxiu Peak," which is in Zhongshan Park in the city. It is more than fifty feet high and has three hundred and six steps. At the foot of the mountain is Liu Cave, where Liu Haichan was painted by King Gonghui of the Ming Dynasty, and it is also where Yan Yanzhi of the Six Dynasties read books.</p>
<p>After returning from visiting the mountains, Chu Minyi gave a speech on national defense at the Lequn Society, with hundreds of listeners. Luo Xinbing quickly sketched the statues of Miao girls Yang Xiuzhi and Yang Xiuying from Lushan in the journey to give to friends. Luo was a reporter from Changsha. Tong Xingbai's poems composed on the way showed great skill, especially the Yuefu "Panshan Xing," which was most satisfying.</p>
<p>The Buddhist statues in the temples in Guilin no longer exist, and there are only a few temples such as "Longyin" and "Yueya."</p>
<p>That night, the group divided up the routes. Xu Zhaorong and others went to Guangzhou via Hengyang. Shen Jicang and others went to Nanyue for sightseeing and then went to Guangzhou. They made an appointment with Yu that he would start writing from Changsha to the south to Guangzhou, and Yu would start writing from Changsha to the north to Wuchang. In this way, the two can complete a full-line travel of the Yuehan Road. Group leader Chu went to Hengyang and did not participate in the tour of Nanyue, and returned to Beijing. Others, such as Cheng Ji'an, went to Changsha in the morning.</p>
<p>On the 46th day (May 20th), the Gui authorities prepared 15 yachts and invited everyone to cruise on the Yangshuo River. At 7:00 AM, the fleet sailed down the river, with those who took small boats to follow. Director Wei Yunsong, Secretary Pan Yi Zhi, and Chief Host Ren led the way. Each boat cost about 200 yuan, plus food, costing more than 3,000 yuan. Chu was so excited that he joined the workers in rowing the boat. Wang Zhixiang, although a cavalry expert, was also able to row the boat. The Lijiang River is deep and shallow, and there is always the risk of running aground. It is necessary to be familiar with the river, so each boat adds three to five workers, and there are also young female boat owners who are responsible for greeting. The group ate the Guangxi boat dishes. Yu was on the fourth boat, with Tong Xingbai, Wang Zengshan, Min Tianpei, Hu Shiquan, and host Wang Jiangyu. The rear cabin was responsible for cooking, and the hostess and her goddaughter were in charge. After traveling 20 kilometers to "Fighting Chicken Mountain," it rained heavily and the weather turned cold. The boat owner took off his clothes to clothe the guests. Yang Kun from boat No. 3 drove a small boat with Li Shaobai when they set off. Because of the rain, they could not catch up with the boat. Yang temporarily took refuge on our boat. Li braved the rain to Dazhen and hung on boat No. 6. After passing Dazhen about 10 kilometers, to "Sheep Hoof" mountain, the mountain is shaped like a sheep hoof, and the village is named after it. Here, the mountain peaks on both sides are exquisite, and the misty rain adds to the picturesque scenery. The place is commonly known as Huashan. Xu Zhaorong was typing and drafting on boat No. 3. The boatmen were not used to seeing it, so they asked if he was playing the qin. After another 20 kilometers, the boat arrived at Xingping Town (Guilin is 47 kilometers from here). Xingping also has a one-piece central school, and the group landed to tour it. Each boat arrived here one after another and moored. That night, Yu stayed here overnight. A fisherman caught a 35-jin green fish in the river, and the hospitality boat bought and distributed it to 15 boats. The boat owner once said that the cost of the boat was 5,000 yuan in Guibi. Three winters depend on one spring. Every summer, it is used to entertain guests in the Elephant Trunk Mountain belt. It has not yet undergone this long journey. It takes more than a day to go downstream between Guilin and Yangshuo, but it takes six or seven days to go upstream. The lords returned to Nanjing, and I was afraid that our boat had not returned to Guilin, and the workers stopped operating for a week when Chairman Lin came to the province last time. The workers are very happy that the lords are here, which refers to the workers' military training period. The mountain scenery near Xingping is ordinary. Each boat left the shore and rolled in the heart of the river. At night, the water flow suddenly became rapid, and the boatman woke up and said, "The water is rising!" It was estimated that it rose by more than two feet steeply, so they untied the cable and went downstream at dawn.</p>

<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Those attending included Acting Mayor Yu, Huang Zaoxiong from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Lu Jingshi from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Dai Yuzhen from the Municipal Police Bureau, Wang Xiaolai from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Zhou Xuexiang from the General Labor Union, Yu Zhenxin from the Municipal Farmers' Association, Chen Lingyun, Special Envoy for Tobacco Prohibition in Zhejiang and Shanghai, Du Yuesheng from the Anti-Smoking Committee (represented by Huang Yuhua), Xu Jingxiong from the Anti-Smoking Inspectorate, Zhou Feicheng from the Education Association (the above formed the presidium), as well as representatives from various courts, public organizations, agencies, schools, and others, totaling over 500 people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman, Acting Mayor Yu, stated briefly in his speech: Today is the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Commemoration Day. Various circles of the city are holding this commemoration assembly here. The enthusiastic participation of all sectors makes me feel very happy and excited. Since Director-General Jiang of Tobacco Prohibition issued many anti-smoking laws, all localities have been able to follow and implement them consistently, with considerable success. This is not only well known to people across the country, but also a fact praised by the League of Nations. The city has followed Director-General Jiang's instructions in carrying out anti-smoking efforts. Although we cannot say that we have achieved any special results, we have made considerable progress. As long as we work together, we will certainly be able to realize the six-year prohibition plan stipulated by Director-General Jiang as scheduled. We know that to talk about national salvation at present, we must first vigorously implement anti-smoking measures, because national salvation requires strength. Strength is divided into physical, intellectual, mental, and financial strength. Opium is a great enemy that harms physical strength. The government is constantly training, educating, producing, and building, hoping to concentrate these four types of strength for development and storage, so that everyone can shoulder their due responsibilities in the future. However, while we are developing and storing on one hand, we are destroying and consuming on the other. Talking about national salvation in this way is, of course, impossible to succeed. Commissioner Lin Wen-zhong once said that if opium is not banned, not only will there be no funds to raise, but there will also be no soldiers to train. Recently, Director-General Jiang of Tobacco Prohibition also said that if tobacco prohibition cannot be effective, no matter how hard we work on other political construction efforts, we will not achieve results. Therefore, national salvation is impossible without eradicating the scourge of tobacco. We must first vigorously implement anti-smoking measures. This tobacco prohibition in our country can be said to be the last tobacco prohibition. If it can succeed, the nation can be revived. If it fails, the national crisis will deepen from now on, and our international status will plummet. Today, as we commemorate Commissioner Lin Wen-zhong, we should adhere to his spirit of thorough struggle and engage in the eradication of the scourge of tobacco, so that there is hope for national salvation and hope for national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Report on Tobacco Prohibition</p>
<p>After the chairman finished his speech, Du Yuesheng reported, saying: Chairman, representatives from all circles, today is the day when various circles in the city are holding the June 3rd Commemoration Assembly, which is also the day to commemorate Commissioner Lin Wen-zhong's burning of drugs in Guangdong ninety-eight years ago. I feel very honored today to be able to represent and report on the general situation of tobacco prohibition in the city. Due to various reasons, tobacco prohibition in Shanghai is somewhat more difficult than in other places. I hope that the representatives from all walks of life present today will pay attention to and assist in this. Now I would like to report on four points: ⑴ Regarding the registration of opium addicts, according to the report of the Municipal Police Bureau, from July to September of the 24th year, more than 10,200 people voluntarily applied for registration. From October to December of the 24th year, more than 30,800 people were forcibly registered. Later, in May of the 25th year, the central government sent Commissioner Ma Liang to Shanghai to handle the reporting and registration of opium addicts. From May 10th to August 10th, there were more than 24,100 people. A total of two registrations were conducted, with more than 65,000 people in total. Whether this number can include the total number of opium addicts in the city, of course, we dare not be satisfied. However, under the propaganda and guidance of the Anti-Smoking Committee and the Municipal Police Bureau, I dare say that we have done a considerable amount of work. ⑵ Regarding the opium addict rehabilitation section, according to the report of the Municipal Health Bureau, from July of the 24th year to March of the 26th year, the temporary drug rehabilitation center established by the Health Bureau, the Hubu Anti-Smoking Hospital, the Hubei Anti-Smoking Hospital, and the Renfan Drug Rehabilitation Hospital have a total of 550 beds. More than 18,100 people have successfully quit their opium addiction. In addition, 20 hospitals designated by the Health Bureau as registered hospitals also handle opium addict rehabilitation work and accept the requests of opium addicts to quit. The total number is 1,865 people. A total of 21,042 people have successfully quit their opium addiction. In addition, due to the strict government laws and the effective propaganda and guidance of the anti-smoking agencies, there must also be many people who quit voluntarily. This can be asserted. I firmly believe that with hard work, the results will be great. ⑶ Regarding the establishment of opium addict factories, according to the registration of the Municipal Police Bureau, the occupational statistics of opium addicts show that most opium addicts are workers and unemployed vagrants. After rehabilitation, they often relapse and reuse opium. If we do not seek fundamental relief methods, it will have a great impact on the promotion of police administration. Therefore, the local anti-smoking authorities in the city, seeing this, have discussed the establishment of opium addict factories. Assuming that this can be realized, not only will the phenomenon of repeated addiction be reduced, but opium addicts can also become independent and self-sufficient when they are discharged from the rehabilitation center. The unemployment panic can also be solved by more than half. The municipal government is currently planning to carry it out. I hope that representatives from all walks of life will support it. ⑷ Cooperating with the authorities in the concessions to prohibit smoking. Since the implementation of the central government's promulgated anti-smoking regulations in the city, the registration and reporting of opium addicts have been gradually completed. Because the concession authorities have not yet taken unified measures, most opium addicts avoid it, and the processing is not without obstacles, especially in the area of ​​smuggling. Acting Mayor Yu, seeing this, has repeatedly and earnestly consulted with the concession authorities to implement central government laws and regulations. He has met with the concession authorities many times, and the person in charge of tobacco prohibition in the city has also been invited to participate. There are currently three methods under discussion: ⑴ The municipal government will set up a special office in the concession to be responsible for registering and issuing licenses to opium addicts. ⑵ Implement purchasing opium based on licenses. ⑶ Vigorously combat smuggling. The concession authorities also expressed sympathy in principle. If there are no special difficulties, with the perseverance of Acting Mayor Yu, we may be able to see the results soon. The above four points are some important points that I, as the chairman, have reported on the city's anti-smoking work over the past year. A detailed written report can be reviewed. In short, the prohibition of smoking is a key to whether our Chinese nation can be rejuvenated. The government has used all its strength. I hope that the representatives attending today can assist the government and unite to mobilize everyone to eradicate this poisonous demon that has harmed the health of the nation for nearly a century. I feel deeply fortunate. After Du's report, Chen Lingyun, Huang Zaoxiong, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jingxiong, and others gave speeches (omitted for brevity).</p>

<p>Allocation of Funds to Relieve Sichuan</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Government raised 1 million yuan in relief funds. After the Beijing Relief Affairs Committee telegraphed Commissioner Hong San to urge the Sichuan authorities to allocate the funds, it is now learned that the Sichuan Provincial Relief Affairs Association telegraphed the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association yesterday, saying that the Sichuan Provincial Government had allocated 850,000 yuan of the 1 million yuan in relief funds raised by the Sichuan Provincial Government to the Relief Affairs Association at the end of May, and the remaining 150,000 yuan had also been allocated to the China Foreign Relief Sichuan Branch for the needs of labor costs.</p>

<p>Zhu Returns to Shanghai This Time</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan, chairman of the Relief Affairs Committee, went to the Northwest and Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces to inspect the disaster situation last month. It has been a long time.

Therefore, he himself returned to the south the day before yesterday and arrived in Beijing yesterday. He will come to Shanghai today to help discuss urgent relief matters in Sichuan, Guizhou and other provinces.</p>
<p>Shanxi Drought Disaster</p>
<p>The drought in Shanxi is serious, especially in the Hedong area. Because the agricultural products in the Hedong area are mainly wheat and cotton, the wheat is now withered and the cotton has not been sown. The grass roots and tree bark have been eaten up. Therefore, there are rumors of people escaping the famine with permits. Therefore, Chuan Zuoyi, Chu Renyongbin, Feng Qinzai, Xue Shixuan, Fan Xiangli, Liu Zixun Ma Hetian, Yao Dahai, Shao Xiuwen Xue Dubi, Wen Shouquan, Lu Feifan, Jing Yaoyue and other hundreds of people launched the Shanxi Hedong Disaster Relief Association, and issued a fundraising brochure. The remittance offices are the Xingye Qian Bureau in Yuncheng, Shanxi, and the Xingye Qian Bureau in Taiyuan, and the Quandetong Piao Hao in Shanghai. The donation announcement is recorded as follows: Respected Sirs, I have heard that Zhou Lang borrowed food, and Zijing has the righteousness of pointing to hoarding. The drifting mother provided food, and the grandson was grateful for the deep grace of the meal. The counties in southern Shanxi have suffered from poor harvests for years. This year, there is a severe drought. The sky has been without rain for a long time, and the land is equal to barrenness. The wheat seedlings are completely withered, and the autumn crops have not been planted. Affected by the bandit disasters in the past, the rooms are empty. Today, due to the economic panic, there is no door to borrow. The sparrows and rats dig, and half of them have no resources to make a living. The faces of the swans and the shapes of the pigeons are shocking. Shixuan and others are concerned about their compatriots and are eager to help. They are ashamed of the lack of the art of alchemy and respectfully write articles for begging for food. It is hoped that benevolent people from all directions and people from all walks of life will either solve their bags or borrow chopsticks to jointly support the righteous act and save the suffering people. Zheng Jianmen's paintings of refugees have been seen to be sad on the road. Ji Ji's historical relief first released millet, and the powerful people praised it as someone. Respectfully announced.</p>
<h3>To Enhance Air Defense Knowledge, the Municipal Government Will Hold an Air Defense Exhibition</h3>

<h3>The Municipal Government and the Public Works Department Will Sign a Tobacco Prohibition Contract</h3>
<p>Establish a Special Tobacco Prohibition Agency and Continue to Negotiate with the French Concession</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the tobacco prohibition policy, the promotion has been quite effective in various places. However, in the public concession and the French concession of the city, due to special relations, the effect has been minimal. The municipal government authorities have repeatedly consulted with the authorities of the two concessions on the issue of tobacco prohibition in the concessions, but there have been no concrete results. It is heard that Acting Mayor Yu recently met with the authorities of the two concessions a few days ago to discuss the method again. The result was extremely satisfactory. A few days ago, Acting Mayor Yu formally sent a letter to Faithstone, the director general of the Public Works Department. Yesterday, Faithstone replied to the municipal government, expressing his willingness to accept the proposal for cooperative tobacco prohibition and contributed his opinions to Acting Mayor Yu. According to Faithstone's words, the consultation is currently going very smoothly, and a contract will be signed soon. It is also planned to set up a special tobacco prohibition agency in the concession to handle everything. The personnel of the agency will be appointed by the municipal government and the Public Works Department. What is currently being consulted is the issue of opium addict registration and drug trafficking management. It is heard that after the negotiations between the municipal government and the Public Works Department have come to an end, they will discuss this issue with the French Concession authorities.</p>

<h3>Seamen Strive to Recover Piloting Rights</h3>
<p>To Hold Expanded Petition in the Capital, Must Achieve the Goal of Recovery</p>
<p>Our country's port piloting rights have long been entrusted to foreigners by the Customs. This not only represents a loss of sovereignty but also, in these extraordinary times, has a great impact on national defense and military affairs. If we do not recover these rights soon, once international warfare erupts, our port gateways will fall into foreign hands, leaving us defenseless. This is a matter of national and ethnic survival. Aware of this, seamen across the country have established a movement to petition the government to recover piloting rights. After submitting proposals and requesting support from Central Committee members like Yang Hu, the issue was presented and passed at the Third Plenary Session, and then handed over to the Executive Yuan for handling. Several months have passed, but there is still no news from the central government, causing anxiety among the seamen. To strive thoroughly for the recovery of these crucial powers, to implement it as soon as possible, and to transfer it to the Ministry of Transportation for management, they have united the national seamen's party branches and organizations, dispatched representatives to the capital in the coming days to hold an expanded petition, determined to achieve the goal of recovering autonomy.</p>

<h3>Construction Chiefs from Various Provinces Gather in Shanghai to Negotiate Investments with Shanghai Banking Circles</h3>
<p>Developing Industrial Construction in Various Provinces</p>
<p>Since the unification of the country, all provinces have been working on the development of construction and the exploitation of industries. In recent years, particular emphasis has been placed on the construction of the national economy. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency learned yesterday from the Shanghai Financial Office that, among the industrial companies jointly organized by government and businesses, following the establishment of the China Tea Company, the National Goods Joint Venture Company, and the Wenxi Paper Company, provincial authorities have also successively sought the development of industries in their respective provinces. It is reported that construction chiefs from various provinces have recently gathered in Shanghai to negotiate with Shanghai banking circles for loans to start industries and construction projects. Wu Tingxiu, the Construction Chief of Hubei Province, is currently staying in Shanghai, contacting various parties in the banking sector, preparing to build a large power plant in Hankou, and planning to establish a national goods company to promote domestic products. Xue Sui, the Construction Chief of Jiangxi Province, plans to open a large-scale sugar factory to benefit the people because the province produces sugarcane, a raw material for sugar production. The capital required is 3 million yuan. During his previous visit to Shanghai, he proposed inviting Shanghai banking circles to inspect Jiangxi. It is now learned that the Jiangxi sugar factory loan is being negotiated between the Construction Department and the Bank of China. Wang Cheng, the Construction Chief of Zhejiang Province, is also in Shanghai to negotiate with the banking circles for loans, planning to establish a large-scale yarn factory in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province. The estimated total cost is 8 million yuan. He has made special visits to Shanghai financial leaders to negotiate the formation of a lending syndicate. It is said that the principle has been largely agreed upon, and further discussions will continue. Yu Jiezhuang, the Construction Chief of Hunan Province, Chen Ticheng, the Construction Chief of Fujian Province, and Lu Zuofu, the Construction Chief of Sichuan Province, have also recently held discussions with the banking circles in Shanghai. Cheng Zhenji, the head of the Anhui Local Bank, came to Shanghai a few days ago. Cheng plans to set up a large-scale national goods company in Wuhu.</p>

<h3>New-Style Laundry Industry Sends Letter to the Municipal Federation for Assistance</h3>
<p>Also Asks the Municipal Council to Withdraw the Order</p>
<p>The New-Style Laundry Industry Guild of this city sent letters yesterday to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers Association, the First Special District Citizens' Federation, and other organizations, stating: "We are writing because we have repeatedly received reports from member stores under the jurisdiction of the Public Concession that the Municipal Council's Health Department has created harsh regulations to oppress Chinese merchants. New-style laundry shops in the Concession are treated as ordinary white garment workshops and must pay for a hygiene license (white garment workshops already have hygiene licenses; new-style laundries have never had any license requirements). They are also ordered to convert existing equipment into various unsuitable facilities (such as installing ground stoves, large pots, and converting walls to terrazzo). Otherwise, they will be forced to close or be fined, causing panic among the members. We earnestly request that you negotiate reasonably and ask the Municipal Council to withdraw the order." The guild has dispatched representatives three times to the Health Department to explain the differences between new-style laundries and ordinary white garment workshops, as well as the difficulties of renovation, requesting that they withdraw the order. However, the Health Department has been evasive on the one hand and continued to act arbitrarily on the other. Police officers frequently go to various shops to force them to pay for licenses or to renovate within a limited time, creating a tense situation. More than a dozen stores have already been reported to the court for punishment by the Health Department, causing all members to be worried and unable to work peacefully. This situation violates the intention of the Concession authorities to protect the safety of merchants. As the guild's duty lies, it is difficult to remain silent. In addition to sending separate letters to reasonably fight for the withdrawal of the order with the Municipal Council, (omitted) we know that your association is the leader of the citizens in the Concession and has a great enthusiasm for relieving the suffering of the citizens. We hope that you will propose a discussion, consider the solutions, and provide assistance. We would be extremely grateful.</p>

<h3>Fictitious Film Company Recruits Employees to Collect Money</h3>
<p>Swindled More Than 130 Yuan, Host Ma Guangyao Arrested</p>
<p>Ma Guangyao, a Shaoxing native residing at No. 13, Lane 28, Fuxu Road, opened the Jinlong Film Company at No. 6, Quanfu Lane, Lane 301, Chengdu Road in April of this year. On the 8th of the same month, he published advertisements in newspapers to recruit tea servants, messengers, and male and female film trainees. Many people saw the advertisements and went to apply. Ma required those who wanted to serve as tea servants and messengers to pay a considerable deposit, and trainees were required to pay a registration fee of 1.20 to 4.40 yuan first. In general, the applicants were eager to find a job and saw that the company had departments such as general affairs, documents, and accounting, and it was of a certain scale, so they did not suspect fraud. At that time, those who paid included (1) Zhang Wenfu 30 yuan (2) Yu Rongyi 20 yuan (3) Xu Zixian 20 yuan (4) Liu Yingqing 15 yuan (5) Chen Zixiang 4.40 yuan (6) Rong Riyi 1.40 yuan (7) Huang Guangkang 4.40 yuan (8) Chai Yutang 2.20 yuan (9) Tang Feng, Zhang Da, Zhu Wenyuan, Wu Lin, Zhao Yun, and a woman, Li Aina, each paid 1.20 yuan (10) Xu Zijin 20 yuan, totaling about 125 yuan. Unexpectedly, on May 13, Ma Wenyao and the host all escaped. Zhang Wenfu and others realized that they had been deceived and jointly reported the matter to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Under the investigation of Chinese detective Sun Wenxi and reporter Zhang Kuidong, because Ma and others were on the run, they could not be arrested. Until 11:45 AM the day before yesterday, Sun and Zhang learned that Ma must pass through the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road, so they went to wait. Before long, Ma came and was arrested and taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Judge Ye Shengchao interrogated him. First, the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu clarified the case and filed a lawsuit for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law. Then, Zhang Wenfu and others abandoned their applications and paid the money. Ma Wenyiao confessed that the Jinlong Film Company was originally opened by Lu Tingfang. I only bought it on May 2 and advertised it by Lu. The money was also collected by Lu. After I bought it, the business was sluggish, so I closed it. I am now willing to pay back the money paid by the plaintiffs. Judge Ye checked the confession and ordered Ma to be detained for another week for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Costs in the 24th Year: 665,384 Yuan; Costs in the 25th Year: 386,755 Yuan</p>
<p>The cost of merchant ship repairs for the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company accounts for a significant portion of its economic expenditure. Recently, after being brought under state control and reorganizing the Shipping Department, great importance has been attached to the engineering aspect. Ship repairs are now carried out through a bidding process. Since Chen Zhaoji has been in charge of the Shipping Department, regular and special repair projects for each ship have been carefully reviewed to ensure that funds are not wasted and that the work is truly effective. An investigation of the 28 vessels of the company's river and ocean fleet reveals that the average annual repair cost has consistently been a huge sum of 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Since last year, the number of ships remains the same and the repairs are still being carried out, but the costs have been greatly reduced. The total repair cost for all river and ocean vessels in the 24th year of the Republic of China was 665,384.57 yuan. The repair cost for the 25th year of the Republic of China has been reduced to 386,755.16 yuan. With comparable ship repair work, there has been an actual reduction of 278,629.41 yuan.</p>
<h3>McKinnon Road Loading and Unloading Station Opposes Appointed Management</h3>
<p>Maintaining the Original State of the Office</p>
<p>The loading and unloading workers at the McKinnon Road freight yard in this city have reorganized from a cooperative into a loading and unloading office. All work is carried out in accordance with the office's rules and the Railway Bureau's contract. For the past four years, the office has never made any mistakes in railway operations or loading and unloading work. Unexpectedly, the office suddenly received a notice from the office of General Affairs the other day, stating that the office was poorly managed and the work was improperly allocated, and that the Traffic Department had decided to appoint personnel to manage it and formulate new management measures to be implemented on July 5th. Upon hearing this news, all the loading and unloading workers at the station were alarmed. They all believed that the office's management of the loading and unloading affairs was not flawed, and that the office's title had been approved by the central government and should not be changed rashly. Moreover, the management measures promulgated by the Traffic Department are particularly unsuitable for the station. Therefore, all the loading and unloading workers at the station held a general meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures. It is reported that a resolution was passed unanimously opposing the appointed management personnel, and a request was submitted to the Central Railway Department of the Ministry of Railways, the Railway Party Department, and the Management Bureau to request the withdrawal of the order.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Collection Bureau Schedules Profit Tax Collection</h3>
<p>Income tax has been implemented for several months now. Apart from a small number of personnel serving foreign institutions who have not yet paid in accordance with the regulations, the amount collected up to last month has reached over 4 million yuan in Shanghai alone. However, income tax is still in its initial stages in our country. To achieve such results demonstrates that the people of our country are very supportive of tax system reform. It is now understood that the Bureau is currently collecting only the second category of income from salaries and wages, and a portion of the third category of income from interest on securities and deposits. However, the first category of income from profit-making enterprises and all income in the first category must be collected starting from July 1st of the 26th year.</p>

<h3>Mother Sues Son for Neglecting Support</h3>
<p>Requesting Ten Years' Living Expenses - Trial Concluded Yesterday, Judgment Scheduled</p>
<p>Qi Qingji, son of the late Sun Qingdao Hao Qi Dexuan (33 years old this year), residing at No. 1, Hengchang Lane, Beile Road, French Concession, was recently sued by his mother (Qi Dexuan's wife), Qi Lian (61 years old, currently residing at No. 4, Yongyu Lane, West Gate Road, French Concession), through her lawyer in the Civil Court for neglecting support and seeking maintenance payments. It is claimed that when the plaintiff's husband, Qi Dexuan, died in the third year of the Republic of China, the defendant was still young. The plaintiff made every effort to educate him. Two years ago, the defendant took control of the plaintiff's late husband's estate, including a piece of real estate on Xiafei Road, valued at approximately 300,000 yuan. At that time, the defendant signed an agreement to provide the plaintiff with 150 yuan per month for living expenses. He paid for three periods, but then stopped fulfilling the agreement and sold the Xiafei Road real estate without authorization for 170,000 yuan. The defendant disregarded the mother-son relationship and neglected the plaintiff's living expenses, requesting a judgment ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff 17,250 yuan for ten years of living expenses in one lump sum. Based on the statement, the court, on the morning of yesterday, summoned both parties through their lawyers to the Civil Seventh Court presided over by Judge Ma Yishu. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the grounds for the lawsuit. Then, the defendant's representative, lawyer Ge Zhiqin, argued that when the defendant's father died, the estate included 100,000 yuan in cash and many antiques, which were managed by the plaintiff. The Xiafei Road real estate had already been mortgaged for 36,000 yuan during the defendant's father's lifetime, and the plaintiff added another 100,000 yuan. Two years ago, the plaintiff handed over the real estate to the defendant for management because the mortgage interest was too high and the rent was difficult to collect, so it was sold for 150,000 yuan. After paying the mortgage interest, there was not much left. The defendant, his wife, and six children lived with the plaintiff. The plaintiff felt that there were too many people and found it annoying, so she separated the defendant and his family. The defendant agreed at the time to pay the plaintiff 150 yuan per month for living expenses. Later, due to insufficient funds, the amount was reduced to 100 yuan per month with the consent of the clan elders and the plaintiff, and the payments have never been in arrears, with records available. The May payment of this year has also been paid in full, requesting the court to reject the plaintiff's lawsuit. After reviewing the facts, the court determined that the case was clear, ordered closing arguments, and announced that the judgment would be pronounced in seven days.</p>
<h3>Western Female Passenger on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Takes Wrong Luggage</h3>
<p>A Coffin Trunk Changed into a Broken Net Basket - Suspicious Plot Awaiting Clues</p>
<p>When the third downward express train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway arrived in Shanghai at 1:45 PM yesterday, one of the passengers, a Western woman, boarded in Nanjing and brought four suitcases, all filled with silverware and valuables. At that time, due to railway regulations, the four suitcases were handed over to the luggage room at the Nanjing station as checked luggage. When she arrived in Shanghai, she immediately took the luggage receipt and ordered a porter to pick them up at the North Station, but unexpectedly discovered that one of the four valuable suitcases had been changed into a broken net basket, having been switched with luggage with another number. After the Western woman learned of this, she reported it to the police, who sent officers to negotiate with the Railway Bureau, but there was no result. On the one hand, the police increased their efforts to investigate. It was then learned that when the suitcase was taken from the luggage room, a porter specially contracted by the Railway Bureau (commonly known as a "tiger cart") was hired at the North Station to deliver it to Xiamen Road. However, the person claiming the luggage hired a rickshaw there to send it elsewhere, so it was impossible to track it down for a while. However, observing the situation, it is not without suspicion, and it seems to be a pre-meditated plan. The inside story remains to be uncovered after clues are obtained. This is the second accident involving lost luggage on the two railway lines.</p>
<h3>Died After Seeking Treatment from Zhang Longweng</h3>
<p>Died with a Loud Scream - Body Awaiting Examination</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been irregular, with sudden cold and hot spells, resulting in a typhoid fever epidemic in the city. The most skilled in treating typhoid fever is the famous doctor nicknamed Zhang Shengji, but after Shengji passed away, his sons and grandsons continued to practice medicine at No. 146, Avenue Edward VII, charging very low fees, only two dimes or ten copper coins. Therefore, there are hundreds of patients every day, and he refuses to make house calls. At 10:00 AM yesterday, an unnamed man, about 40 years old, wearing a black woolen hat, came to the doctor's office for treatment. Unexpectedly, his condition was severe, and he suddenly screamed loudly and fell to the ground and died. Subsequently, the Xinzao Police Station was notified, and detectives sent the body to the morgue to await examination.</p>

<p>At the Gongyi Cotton Mill at No. 150, Rue Robert, Puxi, the factory management verbally abused a female worker in the weaving workshop for failing to work hard at around 12:00 PM yesterday, resulting in all the factory's 2,000 male and female workers going on strike. The factory immediately reported the incident to the Gordon Road Police Station by telephone. Upon receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched four red police cars and two wireless police cars, fully loaded with more than 200 Chinese, English, and Indian police officers, to defend the Caojiadu Branch of the jurisdiction. The headquarters was also notified to dispatch two red police cars and 100 police officers to suppress the strike. Fifteen workers' representatives were arrested. It was not until after 1:00 PM that work began again. All the police cars were withdrawn, and the fifteen workers' representatives were taken to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Ancestral Tomb of Prominent Shi Family in Caoxi Excavated</h3>
<p>Ten Sets of Skeletal Remains Discarded and Destroyed - Grave Robbers Arrested and Sent to Court for Trial</p>
<p>Shi Shifen, Shifang, Shiyao (hao Qixiang), a gentry family residing at No. 72, Shi Family, Caohejing Town, Puxi, has been engaged in business for generations and is wealthy. In the past, they were known as "Half the Town of Shi." Recently, Shi Baisheng, a distant relative of the family, colluded with Xu Wennan and Yi Haiyun from Jiangbei and others last winter to excavate the ancestral tomb located near Shijiabang. All the coffin bricks were stolen and sold, resulting in the destruction of the skeletal remains of Shi's sixth-generation ancestors, the late Consort Cao and Consort Jin, seventh-generation ancestor Ying Kui and his consort, Ying Yuan and his consort, Ying Jia and his consort, and Ying Di, totaling ten sets of remains. When Qixiang discovered this and inquired about the location of the ancestral coffins, he was evasive. Having no other choice, he reported the information to the relevant police station, which recently dispatched police officers to arrest Shi Baisheng, Xu Wennan, Yi Haiyun, and others. The suspects confessed to the crime. The ten sets of skeletal remains were discarded in the river. The police chief believed that these men had privately excavated tombs, discarded corpses, and destroyed evidence, a serious crime. He immediately prepared a document to send to the bureau and then to the court for trial. It is now learned that the case has been clearly investigated by Prosecutor Lei Binzhang, and a public prosecution has been filed in accordance with the instructions.</p>
<h3>Former Municipal Government Clerk Arrested for Fraud</h3>
<p>Falsely Claiming to Celebrate the Posthumous Birthday of Others' Parents - Using it as a Tool to Collect Money for Himself</p>
<p>Zhang Xuanheng from Ningbo, 40 years old this year, formerly worked as a clerk in the Shanghai Municipal Government. He has been unemployed for two years and currently resides at No. 8, Guanhua Lane, Lafayette Road, French Concession, with nothing to do. Recently, due to economic hardship, he came up with a clever idea. He falsely claimed to be He Mou Xuan, a director of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company and the Sanyou Industrial Society, and sent out a large number of invitations in the name of celebrating the posthumous birthday of his parents, in an attempt to defraud money and relieve his urgent needs. However, the matter was not kept secret, and the He family learned of it and reported it to the French Police Station. The police dispatched detectives to Zhang's home at No. 8, Guanhua Lane, arrested Zhang, and confiscated a large number of invitations and a gift registry, which only recorded two yuan in gifts received. He was taken back to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Special Second Court's Criminal Eighth Court, and the police legal counsel requested an extension of the investigation before filing charges. During the interrogation, Zhang confessed that he had been unemployed for many years after working as a clerk in the Municipal Government and had nothing to do. He usually made a living by writing legal documents for people, earning one or two yuan each time. However, because his family of eight was struggling to make a living, he resorted to this trick and asked for leniency. The official said to Zhang, "You write legal documents for people, which is soliciting litigation, isn't that illegal too? Now you are committing fraud by impersonation. This case still needs to be investigated." He then ordered the case to be rescheduled for a hearing in three days, and the defendant was detained.</p>

<h3>After Stealing a Detective's Gun, He Committed Five Robberies</h3>
<p>Firing a Total of Five Bullets - Liang Bingsheng and Others Awaiting Joint Trial</p>
<p>Gao Amao, a detective of the French Police Station, was on patrol on Julai Road on the night of March 16th of this year when he was kidnapped into a car by several robbers. He was taken to a remote place in Longhua, Puxi, where the robbers stole Gao's Browning pistol, two rows of bullets totaling 16 rounds, and his detective license. They then sent Gao back to his original location. The robbers then fled in the original car. He then returned to the police station and reported the situation. This has been recorded in this newspaper. Subsequently, the French Police Station suspended Gao's duties and ordered him to solve the case. Recently, the Public Police Station arrested Zhou Youqing, a member of the gang of thieves, and the French Police Station brought him back, sent him to the Special First Court for investigation and detention, and continued to arrest his accomplices and recover the stolen gun. On the 9th of last month, the Public Concession Hongshan Police Station cracked a robbery case and arrested Gong Shaotang (also known as Si Fa, 33 years old, a local resident living at No. 5, Mayback Road), and recovered a Browning pistol and eleven bullets from his home. It was found that this gun was the same gun that was stolen from French Police Station detective Gao Amao and had been used in five robbery cases, with five bullets fired. Subsequently, seven more accomplices, including Liang Bingsheng, Sun Youren, Wang Baotang, Zhang Anpin, Li Wangshi, and Sheng Jintang, were arrested. Because they had committed robbery cases in the Public Concession, they were first sent to the Special Court for prosecution and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. Now the French Police Station has sent detectives to the First Court to transfer Gong and the other seven people, along with the gun, to their custody. It was found that Sun Youren had previously committed robbery and was sentenced to 19 years in prison by the Public Concession. He was released in February of last year after a general amnesty reduced his sentence. Wang Baotang was also sentenced to 13 years in prison for robbery in the Public Concession and was released in September of last year after a general amnesty. Yesterday, the defendants were sent to the Special Second Court's Criminal First Court, where Judge Sun Penghai interrogated them. Police legal counsel Yuan Jiahuang stated the facts of the case and requested that the case be postponed until the 5th to be tried jointly with Zhou Youqing. After reviewing the report and questioning the defendants about their names and ages, the court approved the postponement to June 5th for a joint trial with Zhou Youqing. The defendants were returned to the police station for detention.</p>
<h3>Investigation into the Suicide of a Dance Hall Girl</h3>
<p>Ruan Chengji Has Been Expelled from Great China University - Another Dance Hall Girl, Yu Aijuan, Did Not Appear in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Yao Aina, also known as Shouyao, Guopei, and Wenxia, a dance hall girl from Jiading, at the Dahua Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road, is nominally 16 years old, but has not yet turned 15 because she was born on December 14th. Yao's father's name is Chenying, 44 years old this year, and he runs a Fuchang cigarette shop at No. 234, Donghan Bili Road, where his daughter also lives with him. Yao is beautiful, lively, and innocent, so her dance business is booming and her income is considerable. Most of the people who dance with her are young students. Ruan Chengji, a student at Great China University on Zhongshan Road, Puxi, goes to Dahua Dance Hall after class, and that is how he met Aina. All the dance hall girls know of Xiao Ruan. Over time, love developed through dancing. In March of this year, they consummated their relationship at the Dongya Hotel. Yao's father learned of the matter and planned to marry his daughter to Ruan, but Ruan was still a student and had no earning capacity, so he could not afford such a huge wedding expense, and the matter reached a stalemate. Yao had not been to Dahua for about two months. On the night of the 24th of last month, at 11:00 PM, Yao Aina secretly swallowed poison and committed suicide. After being discovered by her family, she was rushed to the Shanghai Sanatorium for treatment, but she had been poisoned too deeply and could not be saved, and her life ended tragically. When Yao committed suicide, she wrote two letters, one to her parents and one to Yu Aijuan (living at No. 11, Xinping Lane, Longmen Road, Aina's close sister in the same dance hall). In the letter to Yu, she only wrote a few words: "You are a heartless and ungrateful person," etc. After Yao died, Song, the prosecutor of the Special First Court, examined the body and confirmed that she had committed suicide by poisoning, and ordered her father to collect the body. Since then, Yao Chenying, believing that his daughter, before dying after taking the poison, had said that Yu Aijuan had induced her to go to the Dongya Hotel, where Ruan had intoxicated her with alcohol, and Yu had closed the door, resulting in her losing her virginity, and having found several letters from Ruan to Aina, with words alluding to their relationship, hired lawyer Huang Xiubo to file a lawsuit against Yu Aijuan and Ruan Chengji in the Special First Court for the crimes of interfering with public morals under Articles 231, 125, Clause 1, and 226, Clause 1 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday afternoon, the case was heard in the Criminal First Court by Judge Xiao Xiefen and female clerk Zhou Jingcai. Neither defendant, Yu Aijuan nor Ruan Chengji, appeared in court. Judge Xiao stated that today was for fact-finding and ordered that the hearing be closed to the public because the case involved public morals. After questioning Yao Chenying, he announced a postponement until the afternoon of the 10th of this month. It is rumored that Ruan Chengji has been expelled from Great China University, so the summons could not be delivered.</p>

<h3>Husband Disappears After Crossing Boats, Wife Suspected of Crime</h3>
<p>Mother Ma Files Complaint Demanding Investigation; Court Detains Wife for Further Investigation</p>
<p>Ma Sifa, a thirty-year-old boatman from Teng County, Shandong Province, and his wife, Ma Wangshi, made a living rowing a boat. One evening, they docked in the Yangjing Port in Pudong, and the couple stayed overnight on the boat. On April 26th of this year, Wangshi suddenly went to the Customs Water Police Station to report that yesterday morning at 1 a.m., her husband was fast asleep while she was steering the boat alone back from the fish market wharf. On the return journey, a pair of Chongming fishing boats with sails collided with their boat, causing it to leak. Her husband woke up in shock and stepped onto the fishing boat to argue, but was taken away and his whereabouts are unknown. She stated that he was not wearing any clothes at the time as he had been sleeping, and requested an investigation. On the morning of the 3rd of last month at 9 a.m., a naked male corpse was discovered on the Pujiang beach at Chenjiajiao, Pudong, after the high tide. The face and toes were gnawed and mutilated by wild dogs. The Water Police Station summoned Wangshi to identify the body, and she confirmed that it was indeed her husband's body. The case was reported to the court for inspection, and Wangshi was ordered to arrange the burial. However, the police found no signs of collision damage on the boat, and Ma's bedding was also missing. Therefore, Wangshi was considered highly suspicious and was detained by the court for several days. As there was no corroborating evidence, it was difficult to determine whether she had committed a crime, and she was released. Recently, Ma's biological mother filed a complaint with the district court, alleging that Wangshi had an affair and, under the cover of darkness, threw her son into the Pujiang River to murder him, demanding an investigation. The court then ordered that Ma Wangshi be detained again for investigation. It was alleged that the day before yesterday afternoon, rumors suddenly spread in Yangjing Port, Pudong, that Ma Wangshi had murdered her husband and that the court had sentenced her to death and would bring her to the area for immediate execution. A crowd of hundreds of local villagers gathered to watch. The head of the Yangjing Police Station, knowing that these people were ignorant, sent a patrol officer to explain that if the court found the defendant guilty and sentenced her to death, there would be a separate place for execution, advising the crowd not to believe the rumors and create disturbances. Hearing this, the crowd gradually dispersed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Horse Carriages Eliminated</h3>
<p>Only Eight Private Horse Carriages Remain</p>

<h3>Innkeeper Reports Abortion in Inn</h3>
<p>Gong Yousheng Accused of Inciting; Tang Tangshi and Client Taken to Court</p>
<p>Qian Yueying, a local woman, twenty-two years old, currently residing at a certain number on Rue Roberston, works in a yarn factory. Last autumn, when Qian was living on Zhongxing Road in Pudong, she met Gong Yousheng (age thirty), who lived at No. 1680 on the same road and served as a member of the Pengpu District Defense Corps. They soon developed a physical relationship. After Qian moved to Rue Roberston, the two still met from time to time. Recently, Qian found that her period was more than a month late and suspected she was pregnant. Due to various reasons, she could not keep the fetus, so she secretly discussed with Gong and decided to have an abortion. Gong then found Tang Tangshi (age sixty), an old woman from Yixing who worked as a midwife and lived at No. 153 Qiujiang Road. The day before yesterday, Gong and Qian, accompanied by Tang, went to the Yong'an Hotel at No. 104 Shunde Road, opened room 22, and Tang used bulrush to place in Qian's lower body, intending to abort the fetus. Unexpectedly, the hotel owner found out about this and reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. Chinese detective Wang Shidong went and arrested Gong and Tang, and sent Qian to Guangren Hospital by car. After the doctor removed the bulrush, Gong and Tang were escorted to the Criminal Eighth Court of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case and charged Gong under Article 289 of the Criminal Law and Tang under Article 290 of the same law. Qian was also charged under Article 288 of the same law, but as she is still in the hospital today, it cannot be determined whether the fetus needs to be removed. He requested a postponement for further questioning. After Judge Huang Risheng questioned Gong and Tang, he ordered a postponement for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Du Wenkui's Wife Murder Case Concluded</h3>
<p>Wenkui Says He Will Take Responsibility Alone; Case Concluded Yesterday, Sentencing Set for the Fifth</p>
<p>Du Wenkui, also known as Du Liu, from Qingjiang, because his wife, Du Li, had an affair with Zhou Baolai, Du could not deal with it, so he discussed the intention to kill with his elder brother, She Wenli (also known as Du Wu), his younger brother, Du Wenhua (also known as Du Qi), and Xu Qingen, Du Qi's brother-in-law. Xu Qingen falsely invited Du Liu and his wife to his home for dinner, deceiving them to Meilin Lane in Jinling Road, where they were stabbed to death with knives. Du Li received more than ten stab wounds, and her face was slashed in many places. It is said that when the murder was committed, Du Liu said that because the woman was shameless, he would disfigure her face to vent his anger. However, although the woman suffered many injuries, they were not fatal, so after the murderers fled, she called for help and was sent to the hospital by the police. Although she has recovered, she is now disabled, with long and short scars on her face, and no longer has her former beauty. She immediately filed a complaint with the District Court, and the Du brothers were arrested. Xu Qingen fled. The prosecutor prosecuted for attempted murder. After repeated interrogations, Du Wu and Du Qi claimed that they were not present and were working in Pudong that day. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zongxing continued the interrogation and summoned witness He Shinan, age forty-one, from Ningbo, who worked as a foreman at the Public Concession Water Company. Du Wenli and Du Wenhua (also known as Du Wu and Du Qi) have been working for me for more than ten years. They are hired workers. Last December, when the Pudong Water Plant was opened, I called them to work there. They were working on January 19th. I don't know if they participated in the murder on that day. Du Wenli and Du Wenhua claimed that they were innocent, while Du Wenkui confessed that he killed his wife alone. A real man takes responsibility alone and cannot let his whole family suffer. It has nothing to do with my brothers. Because my wife had an affair with a man named Zhou and wanted to harm me, I was angry and hurt her, but I had no intention of killing her. Du Li did not appear, but her father, Li Kushan, came to court and said that his daughter was injured and had become disabled. He requested an incidental civil lawsuit, claiming damages totaling $3,000. The court ordered the conclusion of the argument, and the sentence will be pronounced on the 5th of this month.</p>
<h3>Texaco Oil Depot Murder Case: More Than One Hundred Criminals Escorted to District Court</h3>
<p>Sixty-Two Weapons Seized; Awaiting Verification of Injuries Before Further Review</p>
<p>Xie Qiaosheng, a local foreman employed at the Texaco Oil Depot wharf in Gaoqiao, Pudong, was recently approached by Zhu Wengong, a foreman from Jiangbei, who claimed that he had a verbal agreement with Xie for a three-year term. Xie's term had expired and Zhu should take over, but Xie denied it. Zhu then recruited one hundred and six workers, as well as cart drivers and boatmen, armed with weapons, and rushed to forcibly seize the position, seriously injuring Chen Shilin, a worker under Xie's command. They also inflicted minor injuries on Guan Liuxing, Yao Guan, Yang Heshang, and others. At the time, Chen Shilin fainted, and rumors spread that he was dead, creating a tense atmosphere. One hundred members of the police and security team were dispatched to arrest people. Because the front was the Pujiang River, the one hundred and six perpetrators, as well as six cart drivers and boatmen, totaling one hundred and twelve people, all fled to a pre-hired barge, thinking they could escape. Unexpectedly, the Customs Water Police also received a call, and the head of the police led all the Chinese and foreign detectives in a boat and rushed to the scene, resulting in the arrest of the one hundred and six perpetrators when they landed. The police went into the water, and all the police were arrested, and forty carrying poles, eleven wooden clubs, five sharp axes, five iron bars, and one wooden root, was seized. The City Police Department escorted them all to the police station for investigation. Chen Shilin, who was seriously injured, was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment and is no longer in danger. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, the police department transferred the criminals in this case, Zhu Wengong, Yang Dehuang, and other accomplices, totaling one hundred and twelve people, and sixty-one pieces of weapons, to the District Court. The prosecutor interrogated them and ordered them to be detained separately. The weapons were stored in the warehouse, awaiting the summon of the victims to verify the injuries before further legal action.</p>

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>The Iron Lung Man</h3>
<p>— Zilan</p>
<p>The iron lung man has been the subject of much discussion in the newspapers these past few days, and it's been a hot topic of conversation on the streets, in teahouses, and in wine shops. People are speaking with a tone of wonder and amazement: A person paralyzed by illness, supposedly on the verge of ceasing to breathe, how is it that sleeping in that cylindrical iron lung keeps him alive? To answer this question of amazement, besides admiring the inventions of modern medicine, there is nothing more I can add; I think most people feel the same way. However, within people's amazement, there's also a sense of shaken belief in the unyielding and unpredictable nature of life: "The King of Hell decides who dies at the third watch, and will not leave anyone alive until the fifth." But now, because of the invention of the iron lung, that American youth, Schneider, has been kept alive in this world for over four hundred days.</p>
<p>Fatalists will naturally find many questions to challenge this, but these can be answered with one general counter-question: If the "iron lung" had not been invented, would that young man have been able to live? But now, because he is a rich man, he is using his wealth to prolong his life!</p>
<p>Using wealth to prolong life, perhaps this is the best reason for fatalists to regard it as destiny, but if wealth and the iron lung were to lack one or the other, how would that be explained? Now, I believe, there must be quite a few people who are dying of paralysis because they don't have this great wealth!</p>
<p>It's not just paralysis patients who are in this situation. With the advancement of modern medicine, let alone prolonging life, there are many cases where a poor person would surely die, but a rich person suffering from the same ailment can be brought back from the brink. There's a saying: "Money can't buy the mandate of the King of Hell," is this also true?</p>
<p>This is just science becoming a slave to the private property system!</p>
<p>Speaking of the iron lung, it seems that at present it can only prolong the lives of paralyzed patients, and cannot cure them; what about in the future? I think with various treatment methods, paralysis will probably not become an insurmountable obstacle.</p>
<p>Therefore, with such hope, prolonging life does not lose its reason for living, and in order to provide medical research, keeping a living specimen for medical researchers to experiment on, that living specimen has even more reason to prolong its life.</p>
<p>In my understanding, a person has the right to survive in society if he is a producer, or at least not a complete consumer. In the current social system, there are certainly many who are idle all day long, and their enjoyment is much greater than those who work all day long, but these are, at best, walking corpses. In the new society of the future, they will inevitably be eliminated. These walking corpses, living healthily, are of no benefit to society. If they are sick, society is not hindered, or rather, it can be said that because of their illness, medicine is spurred to progress, which can reduce deaths and the suffering of disease in the future society, and that is beneficial.</p>
<p>Of course, this still depends on whether all enjoyment will be thoroughly equal in the future. Otherwise, science becomes a servant of the capitalists, and prolonging life for four hundred and some days costs $180,000, then even if there is a major invention, it is still isolated from the masses.</p>
<h3>Liang Tongfang's Suicide</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>Death can be heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather. The same death can give people different perceptions. Some people's deaths make people beat their chests and wail, unable to suppress their grief, but some people's deaths make people laugh out loud and applaud!</p>
<p>Suicide is simply ending one's life because one's thoughts are in a state of chaos and cannot be resolved. All contradictions are resolved by "suicide." The so-called resolution of all contradictions through suicide only means that the suicidal person is resolved by all contradictions. The suicidal person is merely a sacrifice to all contradictions. All contradictions are like spider webs, absorbing "sacrifices" that throw themselves into the net as much as possible. At the same time, they are also fighting against all those who do not want to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Liang Tongfang, this "disabled patriot," is admired by everyone because he had courage, excessive enthusiasm, and could take a bomb, disregarding his own life, to throw at shameless profiteers, letting this bomb wake up the profiteers. In his mind, he believed that people have a "conscience," or that people are "afraid of death," but he could not clearly see that people's "consciences" have long been burned away by "greed." It is true that they are greedy for life, and even more afraid of death, because the more they are this kind of person, the more they are greedy for life and the more they are afraid of death. Because they are greedy for life, they desperately disregard the interests of the country, making their personal lives as comfortable as emperors in heaven. They know that their lives are in front of bombs (of course, not in front of a bomb in one person's hand). For the sake of greed and fear of death, they disregard the loss of the country and sell it to the enemy!</p>
<p>A person taking a bomb to strike at profiteers, this spirit is indeed respectable and lovely, but it is ultimately an action that cannot achieve great results. We have long dared not agree! Because to strike at profiteers, one bomb is not enough, and one person's individual action is not enough. This requires collective action, countless bombs!</p>
<p>Using suicide to awaken the attention of compatriots is far less clever than a person taking a bomb to strike at profiteers! In Liang Tongfang's suicide note, he was quite angry about the sale of smuggled goods by major companies. This anger is shared by all Chinese people, but if everyone commits suicide like Liang Tongfang because of this anger, wouldn't that be great? The enemy would kill us all without firing a shot! This is always too cheap for them!</p>
<p>We should not be sacrifices who throw ourselves into the net. We must live, not be resolved by all contradictions, but go to resolve all contradictions. Suicide is unacceptable!</p>
<h3>A New Invention That Can Predetermine the Sex of a Child</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>According to a report in the London News, a scientist and inventor named Rowe, currently a professor at a certain university, spoke of an invention that can predetermine the sex of a child. If this ideal were to become a reality, the trend of the human race would likely be completely changed. The population problem, which has seemed unsolvable for hundreds and thousands of years, would finally be resolved. Professor Rowe</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>said: There are two medical consultants on Harley Street who are currently implementing a method of predetermining the sex of children. Although I dare not claim to have medical knowledge, from a scientific point of view, the ideal of these two highly skilled medical consultants does have a scientific basis to make it a reality. Some parents in the world want to have sons, and some want to have daughters, but often things don't go as they wish. Those who want to have sons have daughters, and those who want to have daughters have sons. Therefore, these two consultants have devoted themselves to research and spent many years of hard work, successfully creating a liquid that can ensure that those who want to have sons can definitely have sons, and those who want to have daughters can definitely have daughters. It can truly be said that they have achieved more than nature. They have already tested it more than a hundred times, and the results have been 90 percent effective. If the success rate is even higher, this liquid can be considered foolproof. Those who consult these two consultants are all wealthy families, and they all pay a price of one hundred pounds to buy this liquid. They only seek to fulfill their wishes and do not hesitate to spend money. Currently, there is an overwhelming demand from all directions. Professor Rowe is only concerned about this new invention from the perspective of a scientific observer. He also speculated on the possible impact of this matter: The method of predetermining the sex of children may be attacked by people from all walks of life, who will accuse it of interfering with the work of nature. In fact, nature also has the function of predetermining the sex of children. Scientists and medical experts have dreamed of this for centuries. However, after large-scale implementation in the future, there is a risk of an imbalance in the number of men and women, because most parents want to have sons rather than daughters. Those who want to have boys account for 30%, while those who want to have girls only account for 10%. If the country does not strictly enact laws to ban it, then the number of men will definitely far exceed the number of women, which will not only cause family problems but also national problems. Today's dictators are all willing to increase their combat power and naturally want more boys to be born in their countries. This is imaginable. If women are in great shortage, it is also easy to promote war. In ancient times, wars were often fought to seize women and food. Once women are in great shortage, they will become precious "trophies," and in the future, wars may break out for women.</p>
<h3>Home</h3>
<p>— Lin Jia</p>
<p>I cannot, like an experienced fisherman, rush to hold the rudder when the storm comes. I can only be swallowed by the surging torrents, like a fallen leaf surrendering to the west wind... Lately, whenever I meditate under a solitary lamp, I often use such a metaphor for life. I feel it is very appropriate, just like using a fallen leaf to compare the wanderings of a vagrant.</p>
<p>Wandering people sometimes rest, but a wandering heart is still a restless stream.</p>
<p>In the autumn dusk, with a ashamed heart, and carrying my meager luggage on my shoulder, I knock on the rusty iron knocker of my old home's gate. On the wind and rain-eroded wooden door, scattered are speckled, old Spring Festival couplets. From the cracks in the bluestone steps, sprouts a clump of yellowish grass. On the wall, covered with a layer of frost-red ivy, hangs low, trembling in the gentle evening breeze.</p>
<p>Recalling when I left home, my white-haired mother, in the dawn wind, holding a lamp, leaned against the door wall. In the pale black sky, the stars sparsely emitted silver-white light. The sound of roosters crowing continuously pierced through the treetops. I turned out of the ancient alleyway, not daring to look back at the ghost-like lamplight... A burst of hurried footsteps in the yard gradually approached. The door opened with a creak, and fine dust fell down with the vibration. The stooped old servant wiped his eyes, and his mouth was covered with a clump of dry hemp-like whiskers.</p>
<p>"Oh, you don't recognize me anymore?"</p>
<p>He woodenly grunted twice, still responding to a stranger with a strange expression. From the bottom of my heart, I drew out a wisp of bitter regret. He was old, and he couldn't recognize me, this long-departed young man, for a moment.</p>
<p>Stepping through the door, the towering old locust tree bathed in the setting sun, swaying its shadow in the cool breeze. Beneath the reflected wall, was scattered with green moss. Turning around, there was a lotus pot, still buried there were several dead stems, supporting the broken lotus leaves, rustling, making the courtyard even more desolate.</p>
<p>In that old hall, through the slightly yellow window paper, filtered a dim light. My mother was old, her white hair even more abundant. She spent the whole year with the clock in the corner of the wall, passing the years in endless ticking.</p>
<p>On the long wooden table by the window, there was a pot of chrysanthemums, stretching out slender branches, and strings of green leaves hung down.</p>
<p>A green dog curiously sniffed my clothes, barking lowly with malice. I silently walked to my mother's side and called out the word "Mom" that I hadn't said in years. She turned her head strangely, her gray, blurred eyes flickering, and said in a trembling voice:</p>
<p>"I thought you had forgotten your home!"</p>
<p>I wanted to throw myself into my mother's arms and cry heartily. For the past few years, I had been drifting in the heartless sea of people for a vague dream, suffering endless humiliation and harm. When tears welled up in my eyes, I suppressed them with an emotion as cold as severe winter. I told her that I would never leave this warm home again, that I would live in the house in the backyard pressed down by the elm tree, still read the ancient books on the black wooden shelf, still sit on the rocking chair that my father had sat on for half his life, and accompany her to peacefully watch the farmhands plant the twenty acres of vegetable garden, and collect the rent from the tenants at the beginning of winter. Everything was what this old woman had hoped for. Now, in order to comfort the scar on her heart—my older sister's distant marriage—I would become a quiet child again, living silently...</p>
