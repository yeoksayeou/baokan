<p>時評</p>
<h3>為英日談判告英國人士</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>英日關於遠東問題的談判。不久卽將正式開始。這談判。雖然英日兩方屢次聲明以商務問題為主。以中國問題居次。但在目前初度接觸的期間。各方的注意卽已集中於中國問題。特別是滿洲問題與華北問題。這不是偶然的。所謂遠東問題。實以中國問題為主。而目前遠東糾紛的核心。則為日本對於中國的侵略。自從一九三一年九月以來。這種侵略無時不在發展中。直到現在也未見停止。所以英日談判的消息一經傳出。我國上下各方的注意立刻集中於滿洲華北我國領土主權及行政完整所受損害的問題。</p>
<p>由於我國各方面所表示的焦慮。英國外相艾登一再聲明未來的談判。决不至損害中國的主權。犧牲中國的利益。前日中央社南京電。就我國官方對於英日談判的態度也說明了兩個要點卽㊀凡涉及中國事項時必須尊重中國主權領土及行政之完整。㊁事前更必須徵詢中國之意見。並取得我國之同意。艾登外相的聲明。是我們所歡迎的。同時由於我國政府所表示的態度。更希望英國官方於見到之後。在談判時能益加審愼。因為國際外交上的談判。儘有在表面上非常公允而實際上終不免以第三者為犧牲的。</p>
<p>我們所以要這樣表示焦慮。並且希望英國當局審傎從事者。决不是無端的過慮。而是有根據的。第一。在基本的出發點。我們固不敢想望英國在對日談判之際。能以中國的利益為前提。而不以英國的本身利益為前提。因為英國保守黨政治家的實利主羲之頭腦。為我們所素諗的。第二。艾登外相的聲明因極可使吾人寬慰。但英日兩國許多報紙的記載有許多突兀的表示。終不能使吾人釋然於懷。上月英日談判消息初度傳出之際。東京日日新聞卽以喜極而狂的態度。標以“吾人華北—不列顚華中華南”之題目。同時則以亳無疑問之口吻曰“英國承認滿洲國之存在為旣成事實”日方報紙之習於狂誇固不必說但英方報紙如保守黨的重要喉舌“晨報”於三月二十七日響應佐藤外演說的社論中。也說“無論承認與否。滿洲國之存在。卽中國亦幾已認之為卽成事實。”故“現欲調整遠東關係。以滿洲國除外而保證中國其餘部分之完整。實為最要部分。”我們相信在保守黨執政之下。“晨報”所反映英國政府的外交態度。實較之“泰晤士報”更為準確。以這樣重要的言論機關。認為我國可默認侵略者所製造之滿洲偽國為旣成事實。則吾人於受辱之餘對於未來的英日談判不能不感覺深切的焦慮</p>
<p>然而吾人以為以英國最近對我的密切關係應當明瞭我國目前在和平統一發展中所獲得的力量。這種力量。尤以表現於輿論界者。最為顯著。目前中國任何人均不甘願承認與侵略者親近。尤以東北四省的被割裂。華北部分的受肢解。為萬分痛心而不容片刻忘去之巨創。英國固欲珍惜對華之友誼。則决不可一意遷就他人。而置中國之重大創傷於不顧。在近年來。中英之友誼。確已增進不少。尤以英國在物質上在精神上所給與中國之援助。為最可感。目前吾國人民認為如英美法蘇者皆為可以親睦可以合作之友邦。然而正如日本前外相佐藤所云。“英國曾以過去十年間之努力。在中國重獲優勢之地位。”這話誠可細加玩味。吾人深願英國之開明人士。珍惜此十年來逐漸修補培養而獲得之友誼。勿以短時期實利之引誘。而輕易加以毀棄。</p>

<p>“九•一八”事變發生後，日本的軍部和大衆，更感到戰爭的威脅了。</p>
<p>縱然軍部時時在對中國示威，但東北義勇軍的苦鬥教訓，及國際關係的複雜，終於震撼着軍部，喊出“擴充軍備”，“充實國防”的呼聲了。</p>
<p>軍部所提倡的“充實國防”，是所謂的“廣義充實國防”。其要點在於救濟農村，復與農村。兵士多來自農家，這呼聲是代表下層兵士的願望。但犧牲農村，是日本資本主義的發展條件之一。切此，在“復與農村”這個口號下，自然孕育着反財閥的意向。“九•一八”事變後的日本法西斯，確曾極力的反對過財閥，最後反對的是三井，因為三井是財閥中的最大的一個。</p>
<p>但，社會是資本主義的社會，無論如何，資本家總是掌握着社會的領導權，而且一切最大的利益，也必然是落到財閥的手裏。—請看“九•一八”事變後的三井吧！</p>
<p>三井東洋棉花公司和物產公司，在“九•一八”後，益更發展了。三井信託的資本，較一九三二年增加了六千八百七十萬元（據一九三六年的調查）。三井生命保險的資本，也增加了八百十五萬一千元。儘管軍部在高唱反財閥，但侵略的結果，戰爭的結果，仍然不外是替資本增加利潤。</p>
<p>財閥一方面利用殖民地擴大的機會，壓抑國內的左翼運動。同時更積極的籌劃着，要如何纔能把高唱“反財閥”的右翼陣營，放在自己的懷裏。因此，便採用了“退一步進兩步”的策略，這即是轟動日本社會的—三井的轉向。</p>
<p>稍稍分出一點利潤來，用在社會事業上，這便是三井的轉向了。從一九三二年到一九三六年，三井對社會事業的捐獻，共一千二百五十二萬九千餘元，再加上“滿洲國”投資一千萬元，及報恩會（三井所建立，以發展文化改進社會為宗旨）會費三千萬元，共計六千二百餘萬元。這便是三井轉向的表示。自然哪，這數目在三井的全資本中，只佔最少數（根據日本稅務署的調查，一九三四年三井的所得額，較“九•一八”事變前，增加了百分之五十。）。然而就只這最少數，已足令法西斯急進派受到打擊了。</p>
<p>在今日日本軍部的上層部中，急進法西斯派失敗了，最佔勢力的是所謂的漸進派，而三井卻還正在企劃着，要如何才能澈底領導法西斯。</p>
<p>在由資本主義造出的生產力，和資本主義的生產樣式之間的予盾，已經達到資本主義一般的危機的時期，資產階級便往往移行到法西斯主義的公然的獨裁狀態。日本財閥目前要走的就是這條路。但——若日本的法西斯勢力，不在資本家的領導下，那資本家就不免要費點心思了。</p>
<p>現在且轉回頭去，看看“九•一八”事變後三井的社會事業：</p>
<p>一•對國防及軍事關係的捐獻：例如“一•二八”滬戰后“上海派遣軍慰問金”五萬元，西京國防費十萬元，愛國恤兵會費五十萬元……等。</p>
<p>二•對學術文化事業的捐獻：例如日本文化聯盟計盡助成金三十萬元（能領此助成金者，僅限於右翼思想系統的文化團體）……等。</p>
<p>三•對國際團體之捐款：例如善鄰恊會費三十萬元（此團體外界知者很少。其目的純在考慮蒙古民族之現狀，在蒙古各地推行文化的施設，助成蒙古之產業開發，促進日蒙通商，經營善鄰協會圖書館，惟具有日本國策色彩的敎育，指導蒙古的留日學生）愛國婦人會基金五萬元……等。</p>
<p>四•對“滿洲”及朝鮮之捐款：例如朝鮮綜合博物館建設費十五萬元，“滿洲”鏡泊學園建設費五萬元（是移民團的敎育機關，因常被義勇軍襲擊，現已解散。）“滿洲國”留日學生會館建設費十萬元……等。</p>
<p>除上列各種捐款外，尚有關於學校，體育……等捐款多種。綜計近五年中，三井的社會捐款共達四千餘萬元（“滿洲”投資在外）。這些錢，雖不盡是三井自動捐出的，但確已把三井從法西斯的威脅下解放出來，過渡到領導法西斯的地位了。（未完）</p>

<p>［東京］英國對華借款一千萬鎊業已成立之說、此間甚囂塵上、並認為此項借款、純為恊助中國建設之用、並不含有任何政治意羲、據朝日新聞倫敦專電稱、關於對華借款、英政府極欲獲得日本之合作、其所舉理由之一為中國海關行政上之完整、緣海關收入為借款之主要保障、極有賴於日本之合作也、該報又謂、日本茍拒絕合作、英國將單獨或與美國合作、對華供給借款云、聞外相廣田對英國建議、準備予以積極之贊助、惟外務省發言人今晨聲稱、日政府尚未接獲英政府對華借款之建議、日本接獲建議後、是否將與英國合作、繁於將來之情形云、此間觀察家相信、日本有故意鋪張中英借款談判之嫌、因彼等相信、實際上孔祥熙氏在倫敦舉行之談話、英政府似未對日本保守秘密云、（二十八日中央社電）</p>

<h3>魯省漢奸曲運鴻與日人合辦金鑛案</h3>
<p>實業部已取消其登記　日人正要求賠償損失</p>
<p>濟南通信、去年有漢奸曲運鴻、匈結日人、開採招遠縣玲瓏山金鑛、在靑島社會局朦混呈請轉實業部備案、實業部鑛政司及靑島社會局不察、竟予照准、一時日人氣焰洶洶、大舉籌開該鑛、並似有某項企圖、地方輿論大譁、嗣經省府•靑市府•實業部•三方研究挽回辦法、至現在始經實業部將其登記取消、但日人心有未甘、據稱損失七八十萬元、尚在要求賠償之中、茲事經過年餘、因關係甚大、迄未能發表、茲旣解决、特將經過補述如次、</p>
<p>該鑛沿革</p>
<p>招遠縣玲瓏山之金鑛在清代末年、即由宦魯粵人李宗岱開採、鑛質甚佳、用舊式方法採取、每日可出金一百兩、凡容易開採之處均已採完、殆後李逝世、繼之者不善經營遂歸擱淺、至數年前有曲運鴻者、與日人合辦續開該鑛、賠累不堪、至去年春、曲又聯絡日人、大舉集資、共達一百四十萬元、（中七十五萬元、日六十五萬元）、因恐省府不准、將公司由濟移靑島、靑市社會局竟為轉呈實業部備案、由呈請至批準不過三個月、為歷年呈請開鑛批准之最速者、故外間對靑社會局與實業部鑛政司、有種種傳言、省府聞訊後、連電實業部聲明並未接靑市府之通加、此後决不能再有此等事實發生、但利權已損失、挽回無及矣、</p>
<p>日人企圖</p>
<p>該鑛公司雖名為中日合辦、實在曲運鴻僅為傀儡、大權全落日人之手、（滿鐵列該鑛為財產之一）查該鑛不但含金量豐富、且招遠距龍口海口只六十華里、倘歸外人經營、恐以該鑛為根據地、前途隱憂、不堪設想、且去年由所謂中日合辦該鑛以後、日人即積極準備一切、擬建選鑛發電煉鑛三廠、購地數百畝、並由龍口至該鑛裝電話、鋪輕便路、機器一部早已運抵龍口、龍口並設有辦事處、與職員宿舍、購買大宗炸藥、用電鑽探某國軍艦到龍口者、軍官均乘汽車至玲瓏山鑛所查看地勢、用意叵測、地方人均痛恨靑社會局與實業部鑛業司、置為喪心病狂、</p>
<p>取消登記</p>
<p>今春國民黨三中全會開會、靑市長沈鴻烈到京、旅京魯人、一再訪沈探詢該鑛情况、沈遂電靑將全案卷宗調京、並謁實業部長吳鼎昌、商討補救辦法、旅京魯人、亦約實業部商業司長張軼歐、質問此事、談話結果、證明責任多半在鑛政司與青社會局、惟暫不追究、决定由政府與地方人士合力研究挽回辦法、事後、實業部即積極進行調查、結果、該公司所列股東姓名、按住址往尋、均無其人、全係冒名頂替、遂將該公司登記、予以取消、惟日人謂已投資七八十萬元、要求賠償損失、尚未知結果如何、經手辦理此事之青社會局長儲鎮、業已去職、實業部鑛業司長、亦尚未聞有何處分、</p>
<h3>粵省幣制改定後物價問題</h3>
<p>外省輸粵貨價略降低　黃元彬發表改制意見</p>
<p>廣州通信、自粵券與國幣重訂比率為一四四後銀行方面、為遵守功令計、經於本月廿一日起、所有買賣付揭交收、及匯單款項、俱由交方以一四四比率伸算、收方亦不得拒收、中央•中國•交通•各分行及省立銀行、均於鬥前標出“兌換國幣”字樣、連日中•中•交•三分行收回粵券約百餘萬元、省立銀行於二十一日兌回七八十萬元、二十二日兌回達百萬元、至各銀號買賣市價、因需要手績費其收兌省券比率約在一四三九之間、港券與省券比率為一四七日來尚無鉅大漲落、</p>
<p>粵省幣制旣改用大洋、明年元旦起、决即實行今年下半年、仍以省券照法定比率行使、一面陸續以國幣收回粵券銷燬、然今後改用大洋、最值得考慮者有兩大問題、一為財政預算之變動、據財政當局估計、粵省改用大洋（即國幣）後、省稅收入、每年約短少一二百萬元、如何籌抵、尚待研究、稅收旣减少、同時公務員及敎育界薪給、自當發給大洋、在庫帑開支、自然增加、若照原薪額發大洋、而以折扣出之、（傳將以七折支付）亦非辦法、故今後年度預算驟增開支、其抵補方法、非另開稅源籌補、則應由中央補助、至改用國幣後之物價問題、關係全粵人民生活之利鈍、尤為重要、粵省年來以農村破產、華僑匯款回國亦减少、商業又復凋敝、失業者不可數計、在改大洋制後、勞力者工資、將改發大洋、粵券折合大洋、面額必較平時粵券收入為少、倘若物價不降至水平、則勞力勞心之中下階級生計、將較前尤苦、蓋收入短少、而銷費仍等於平常、換言之、物價仍不低降、則改用大洋、首受痛苦者、為勞力者與勞心者之社會、照目前觀察國幣與粵券低减比率至一四四後、物價隨之降低者、僅外省輸入之米穀•荳油•花紗•麵粉•等數項、蓋中匯略降、外省貨物隨之略降、有確切之數日可以計算、不容奸商掩飾、至若省內產物并用大洋購入者、則欲其隆價、至一定程度則為事匪易、因無大洋價為之標準、奸商必從中操縱、藉口他故、以維持原有價格、政府將用何法以善其後、此實一大問題、內地產物貨品、佔粵人日常生活品一大部份、此而不决、則勞體力與勞心力階級、旣受收入之减少、而仍未享一般貨價之减低、此種畸形生活之痛苦情形、實無可逃避、故此點為改用大洋後當局亟應注意之事也、</p>
<p>又中山大學經濟系主任黃元彬、對於此次粵省幣制改革、曾發表談話、備述意見、其結論如下、“惟對於明年一月一日起截角收回粵幣券一事、正值世界景氣轉好之時、尚可勉强行之、亦宜以緩進之法行之、在粵民對於比率、未有鞏固觀念之前、仍須留回一大部分粵幣、作為輔幣之用、苟稍為急進、必具下列之弊端、（見下）而第一點、財政無法支持、無論如何、終不出於中央補助與增加稅牧兩途、惟數額太大、頗難有此把握、此為最應考慮者也、關於稍為急進之弊端、約如下述、㊀工入農民不資、（包括機器工人、手工業工人、與農礦蠶絲等之工人）驟難按照比率削减、各種產品之生產費增加、生產必受打擊、農村建設、勢須延遲、㊁全省公務人員、與國•省•市•立學校敎職員、勢必請求遵照官級、發給國幣、以全國官俸、應求統一、不應歧視為口實、財政亦艱於應付、若不能統一官俸、祇先統一貨幣、政府亦難置詞、此次抑低比率、稅收亦略為减少、在財政赤字之下、何能增加此鉅額之支出、故急進之法、頗難施行、單由財政上之觀點言之、應在整理財政有效之後也、㊂流通中之粵毫券、約有十分之八九、係在牧買白銀後發出、尚屬新幣、若遽行收回、約浪費六七百萬元之印刷費、”</p>

<h3>雲南的民政</h3>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>雲南民政、過去很少成績可觀、本屆省政府各廳長、為統盤計劃起見、因擬定“三年施政方案”、請省府公布實行、并考核成績、嚴行獎懲、於是全省民政、才漸有進步、</p>
<p>雲南去縣保衛團的組織、原遵照二十三年部頒條例施行、不過當局斟酌地方情形、略有變通補充而已、警通所稱保衛團、係包括保甲•保衛隊•常備隊•三種而言、㊀保甲•是辦理保衛團的基本部份、加入此項編制的、不以人工為標準、是以戶數為標準即每戶人口、不拘老少、都要編人保甲組織、此外還有一種“會團辦法”、亦與部頒會“操辦法”不同、會團辦法、即令各屬區團甲牌、戶口由三百戶至五百戶的、每月舉行會團一次、五百戶以上至一千戶的、每一個月舉行一次、一千戶以上至五千戶的、每半年舉行一次、會團時、每戶至少要去一人、并帶武器一件、不拘刀矛槍械至時、不作任何操練、僅由區鄕甲牌長宣傳最近時局及重要政令新聞、若有地方糾紛、也就秉公解决、㊁保衛隊•是保甲進一步的組織、即由所編保甲中、抽調二十歲至四十歲的壯丁、一律編成保衛隊於農暇時、召集訓練授以相當的軍事技衛、及黨政常識、他們的任務、平時各營生業、保護地方、清勦散匪、以不出縣境為原則、但遇非常事變常歸隊不敷調遣時、即有被徵調而增援的義務、平詩并選隊中體格强健膽量充足者、特組“緝捕”“截堵”等隊、餘為防守隊、每年并由總團長（縣長兼）施行緊急集合二三次、㊂常備隊•是雲南特採取義務民兵制的一種組織、凡年滿二十歲至二十四歲的男子、都有編入常倫隊受訓練服役的義務用抽籖法徵調、役期六個月、退伍時、同綏署暨省府發給證書後、歸入原徵保甲為預備團兵、至於各縣常備隊編制訓練、及委任官長、領發軍需軍械等事項則另由“團務督練處”秉承綏署暨省府的命令辦理、團務督鍊處之下、還劃分全省為十區、每區設一督練分處、勷助辦理、各縣受訓退伍的常備隊、已達五六期、計四萬餘人、以後逐漸推進、務使全省壯丁、普遍受訓、此外、修繕城池、并建築碉堡五千餘座、雲南現行行政區域、計有一市、一百一十二縣、（民國二十二年、民廳根據各縣區域人口財富三項調查統計、厘定各縣等級、計一等縣二十五縣、二等縣二十七縣、三等縣六十縣）、十四設洽局、一設治專員、二對汛督辦、合計直屬於省廳者、共一百三十個行政單位、另有縣佐十缺對汛十一缺直隸於各該管縣政府及對汛督辦署、全省人口、除昌寧•硯山•兩縣寧蒗•梁河•滄縣•三設治局、尚無調查數字外、其餘共計一一•七五〇•四六二人、面積約一•二〇一•〇〇〇平方華里、平均每平方華里約得十一人、</p>
<p>縣的打政、不拘民財建敎的政事、縣政府都要聯帶着辦理、眞是範圍廣泛、職責繁重、推而上之、以這樣的一百三十個行政單位、交集於民政廳長管轄、當然不免有鞭長莫及兼顧不暇之感、可是雲南為什麼又不設立瞥察專員呢、據民政廳長丁兆冠說、一因經費困難、多設機關、必多用經費、二因地方太遼闊、交通又不便、行政多一道轉折、效率必多一番减縮、暨如普洱區的新平縣、距省域僅四站假使在思茅設一專員、縣上呈公文就要先走思茅公署、計十四站、後轉省廳、又十七站、再由省廳批轉下去、叉三十一站、共計來回需時六十幾天、莫說行政效率、必然的减低、就是“通海醬油”也要變成“祿豐醋”去了、（俗有“通海醫油河西布玉溪姑娘綠豐醋”之說、意指各該縣所產諸物甚好）、</p>
<p>為了要推進和改革縣政起見、民廳特於去年創辦一期縣長訓練所、受訓學員九十一名、今年春初畢業有一批已分發各縣任事、</p>
<p>雲南各縣行政官的待遇、由表面上看、顯然是一椿貼本生意、民國四年起、縣知事的月俸、一律是銀幣一百元、公費則不同、計一等縣四百五十元、二三兩等縣各差一百元、額外還有點陋規作補助、可以說是縣知事的黃金時代了、後自民十到二十三年、因財政支絀、年甚一年、薪俸階級的人、都受了影響、縣長每月俸•公•一齊在內、一等縣僅舊滇票一千二百元、（合國幣一百二十元）二等縣一千元、三等縣八百元、而且一切科長科員獄吏的薪工、和筆墨紙張茶水的費用、都滿包在內了、以約合百十元國幣之數、也辦一個縣府開支、自然極感困難、但自二十四年起、以財政漸有起色、俸公業已增加一倍矣、</p>

<h3>日本第十一屆聯合微生物學會概况</h3>
<p>— 汪美先（寄自東京）</p>
<p>日本第十一屆聯合微生物學會於四月七八九日在新瀉醫科大學細菌學敎室舉行三天，發表論文，討論問題，舉行特別演講，盛極一時，筆者曾隨慶應大學醫學部細菌敎室同人參與，頗有所感，故不揣愚昧，茲將該會盛况約略記述如後，以響國內同好。</p>
<p>日本聯合微化物學會成立已將十一載、以從事微生物學之研究為宗旨，每年舉行大會一次，開會地點及會長每年交換一次，去年在東京慶應大學細菌晉晋敎室舉行，會長為奏佐八郎博士，今年會長為新瀉醫大宮路敎授，事先由會長指定幹事六人至十人，籌備開會等一切事宜。該會以研究微生物學為目的之學會，醫校，及其他研究機關組織而成，至今加入團體有三十七個之多，茲將其名稱列如左：</p>
<p>東京帝國大學醫學部黴菌敎室</p>
<p>京都帝國大學醫學部微生物學敎室</p>
<p>大阪帝國大學醫學部細菌敎室</p>
<p>九州帝國大學醫學部細菌學敎室</p>
<p>東北帝國大學醫學部細菌學敎室</p>
<p>北海道帝國大學醫學部細菌學敎室</p>
<p>慶應大學醫學部細菌學敎室</p>
<p>京城帝國大學醫學部微生物學敎室</p>
<p>台北帝國大學部細菌學敎室</p>
<p>長崎醫科大學細菌學敎室</p>
<p>熊本醫科大學微生物敎室</p>
<p>岡山醫科大學細菌學敎室</p>
<p>金澤醫科大學細菌學敎室</p>
<p>新瀉醫科大學細菌學敎室</p>
<p>千葉醫科大學細菌學敎室</p>
<p>名古屋醫科大學細菌學敎室</p>
<p>京都府立醫科大學微生物學敎室</p>
<p>東京慈惠會醫科大學細菌學敎室</p>
<p>日本醫科大學細菌學教室</p>
<p>滿洲醫科大學微生物學敎室</p>
<p>陸軍軍醫學校防疫學敎室</p>
<p>海軍軍醫學校防疫學敎室</p>
<p>東京帝國大學傳染病研究所</p>
<p>北里研究所</p>
<p>大阪帝國大學微生物病研究所</p>
<p>石神研究所</p>
<p>滿鐵衛生研究所</p>

<p>日本大學齒科微生物學敎室</p>
<p>日本微生物學會</p>
<p>東京顯微鏡學會</p>
<p>該會經費由構成團體負担每團體每年繳納會費二十元北里研究所，傳染病研究所各以五個單位日納，大阪帝大微生物病研究所以二單位繳納，但從事微生物學之研究者，若欲在該會發表論文，經評議員之介紹，亦得直接加入為臨時會員，每一演題繳納五元；至於加入團體之演題，每單位不得超過三題，以示限制。</p>
<p>本屆大會演題共有一百二十八個之多，會期三日中，雖每日自上午八時開始至下午五時終止，亦覺甚短促，故每演題限制只能講七分鐘，講台上裝置有信號，綠色電燈開始，黃色電燈五分鐘，紅色電燈七分鐘，必須降台，但質問，追加可延長二分鐘，如此限制，每日還須火遠的交替演說，所以每個演題不能不極力精縮，報告個大概許多表格亦只能走馬看花的交換着。每次演講時均請有評議員，這大多為各醫大敎授或研究所主任等担任，每次演題講學均由評議員起立詢問有無質問與追加，若無方繼續次回演講，若有儘可將疑點提出質問，自己有同樣研究或見地，亦可提出追加。演者表格等均事先交與辦事員，由他們帮同處置，演講時如需要幻燈，電影，亦須事先聲明。演題講完後必須將原稿交於塲中紀錄員，如果有質問與追加時，記錄處卽有筆紙送來，請求將原意再書而提出，以便日後編輯××刋時補加印行。</p>
<p>演題次序，以相類似的徘列在一起；為了演題太多，無從下筆，故將重要幾點寫在下面</p>
<p>㊀自近年Felix　Pitt諸氏發見腸傷寒菌含有vi抗原與否，與毒力強弱，集落性狀，凝集反應，RakteiJsphage等均有密切關係後，各國相繼研究不遺餘力，日本此次大會對於這方面的演題也很多。</p>
<p>㊁第三日的演題全部是關於，濾過性病原髒方面，其中尤以年前東京等地發生流行性腦炎的病原研究演題最多。從來流行性腦炎之研究，均以猴作實騐，日本近年均以小白鼠實騐，甚得相當成績，此次德國該地根大學創立二百年紀念，卽招聘東京帝大竹內敎授講演“日本流行性腦炎病原體之研究與分佈”。</p>
<p>㊂特別演講為大阪醫大敎授谷口氏之“輓近濾過性病原體研究之知見”此為該氏多年來之研究，解述濾過性病原體之本態，大小，鏡檢方法甚詳，曾歷三小時之久，並以滿堂表格，實物，幻燈等解說，極得聽者之歡迎。（關於濾過性病原體之知識，筆者有機會，當另抽暇介紹）</p>
<p>㊃最後值得一提的，是關於鼠疫的研究，大連所謂滿鐵衛生研究所，曾有深切的研究，關於此等論文達七七七件之多，其中倉內氏之鼠疫菌抗亢免疫，據云有相當效騐，故此次淺川論文審查委員會授以榮譽獎牌。</p>
<p>日本醫藥會之多，總數達五十個左右，每科每門均設有學會，討論研究各部分學術，籍以與日並進，每年春季相繼在各地舉行大會，生氣蓬勃，日本醫學進步能如此迅速，能與歐美諸國並駕齊驅，不能不歸功於此，尚望我醫界同人，急起直追之。</p>
<h3>婦科學講義編後感言（連載診療醫報）</h3>
<p>— 瞿紹衡</p>
<p>統觀婦科各病療法。除急性炎症時應用冰囊外。莫不以保溫忌寒為至旨。蓋所以護衛生殖機能也。然而近代士女。罔識斯義。盲從歐化。醉心摩登。雖於雪地冰天之嚴冬。亦尚簿衣單褲。絲襪涼鞋。嬝娜街頭。自以纖弱為美。柔軟為良。強背天性。違反衛生。日新月喪則健者弱。弱者病。而病者死矣。良以宇宙之間。空氣上簿下厚。遇熱則膨脹而上昇。上昇則冷氣來補。上昇下降。風遂以生。吾人坐立於空氣之中。雖全身受寒冷刺戟。然因體位關係。兩足所受獨多。身體為調節體溫起見。皮膚如覺神經。如遇寒冷。卽使血管收縮。防止體溫放散。一面促進新陳代謝機能。多造熱量。以應所需。反之苦遇炎熱。則又令血管擴張。以洩餘熱。一面弛緩代謝機能。限制生熱。故雖在嚴冬極冷之季與炎夏極熱之時。體溫常保持攝氏三十七度也。蓋皮膚知覺非常敏捷。譬如夏日。赤蓋當空之際。室外空氣。在攝氏三十八度（華氏百度）以上。若一足跨入冷氣設備室。則似進入冰窖。旋由該室步出戶外。則又似身歷火坑。如此一冷一熱。相差足有攝氏一〇一二〇度以上。調節機能。難免有不及或不能之處。卽能調劑於暫時。終必不免損壞於一日。且血管收縮。因可防止體溫放散。然其所轄部分之營養。亦因是而起障礙。凍瘡之發生。血行不良之結果也。按足部神經中樞在萬椎（卽腰椎下部）而性器（生殖器）之中樞。亦在薦椎。故足部所受之寒冷。其影響及於全部性器之血液循環及營養狀態者至重且大。其正在發育者。因之而發育不全。其已在產育時期者。因之而經錯不姙。其原有性器疾病者。因之而遷延反覆此不惟人類如是也。草木禽獸無獨不然。試觀園中花木一屆冬季。根部均用稻草包紮。或泥土環繞者防禦下部寒冷之明證也。某日著者至閔行曙園養鷄塲。在太陽普照大地之時。四顧不見隻鷄之影。遂問塲主朱漢閣君。緣何不將羣鷄放出遊散。朱曰冰凍未解。鷄脚獨冷。則受寒而卵少。且恐拾食冷物也。欲求花木繁盛。產卵增多。尚見如此保護。豈有負蕃衍種族使命以生產為天職之婦女可不格外珍攝哉。</p>
<p>著者近見年輕婦女。因不姙及月經不調而求治者日益衆多。揆厥原因。雖不一端。然如前述之摩登裝束。實為一大原因。（余曾著有“摩登性寒腿病”一書）。今之妙齡士女。動輒曰腰燒腿痛。經血不調。試問獲高齡享大年之老婦。其幼時有無此病。其幼時之裝束。又若何。非今昔氣候相異。實古今服裝不同。致女子體格。纖弱委縮。日趨卑下吾恐十年以後。其為害更不堪設想。如是而欲期健國强種。則無異南轅北轍。緣木求魚也。有民族觀念之當局及高唱優生論者。將何以善其後乎。</p>

<h3>市警察局擴大紀念週蔡勁軍講警察使命</h3>
<p>本市警察局長蔡勁軍、為實施官警精神訓話、昨晨八時召集該局各科處及各分局所長等全體官長職員約八百餘人、集中總局舉行擴大紀念週、行禮如儀後、由蔡局長訓話、題為“警察之使命”、對全體官長、勗勉有加、茲誌其原詞如下、</p>
<p>在這內憂外患交迫之下、整個都市與農村經濟均行破產、民不聊生的國難期間、警察負有什麼樣的使命、應該採用什麼樣的訓練方針、才能達到我們救亡圖存復興民族的目標、這是我們不能忽略的、我們的任務、在消極方面講、是怎樣防患未然、保障人民財產的安全、積極方面講、還得怎樣勵精圖治、拯救人民、造福社會、增進人民的生活幸福、然後萬衆一心、共同努力、來推動復與民族繁重的工作、我今天分三點來說、</p>
<p>第一要檢討我們過去所做的是什麼警察可以說是地方的度量衡、換句話說、就是人民的行止標準、我們應該作人民的表率、作人民的模範、鼓勵人民、利導人民、不是呌我們剝削人民、摧殘人民、壓迫人民、欺騙人民的、假如我們為民間排難解紛、存心仁愛、作事公正、舉動莊重、純潔無嗜、人民一定要愛護備至、聽我們的指導、假如我們自持艱苦、嫉惡如仇、不為利誘、不為勢屈、磊落光明、人民一定要敬畏備至、不敢為非、警察與人民的區別、只是職務不同、其奉公守法、乃是一個共同的信條、我們檢討過去的一切、是不是以身作則、艱勞任職、廉潔奉公、我們如果處在領導人民的地位、先不能守法、人民怎樣能信仰、所謂“己不正•焉能正人”那就失掉了領導人民的資格、蔣委員長對警官學校高級班畢業學員訓話、曾說“欲丕變現在警政寧敗的風習、必先自重其人格、以提高一般人對於警察的觀感、自重者人恒重之、自愛者人恒愛之、振衰起敝、宜秉持革命的精神、努力品德的修養、”蔣委員長這幾句訓詞、眞是振聾發瞶的晨鐘暮鼓、因為救國的行動、須出之於人民的自覺、怎樣使人民能感覺到、體騐到、自覺救國的任務、必須警察先自覺、過去的警察、信用太低了、必須人人自重其人格、更正或提高一般人對於警察的新認議、警察先自重其人格、自身能發揮自己效果、人民中間、自然會模仿向上、“所謂上有好者、下必有甚焉者矣、”如此警察與人民中間、不但去掉了隔膜、而且互相增加同情心被此同情心印照起來、燃燒起來、馬上就可看到力量、警察自己如果言行先不一致、欲想人民安分守己、就不容易、安能在救國運動中發揮鉅大的力量呢、今天我對大家下一警告、以後無論官警、如敢不自檢點、一經發覺或人民密吿、查有實據、定當一律重辦、决不姑息、並且我過去招待本市紳耆已說過、很希望所有市民、共同檢舉、本局長當代守秘密、以便澈查嚴辦、</p>
<p>第二要認清我們所應當做的是什麼　凡事之成功、必定先有主義、必定先抱有犧牲的精神、如果醉生夢死、茍且偷安、畏首畏尾、患得患失、那總不會成功、我們認清了自己責任、我們就看重責任、我們旣担任了這樣職業、我們就盡力執行職務、無論在消弭罪犯賊盜、救濟災患、均不重在醫已經發生的病症、重在預防或消弭未發生的病症、我們對於各種的訓練、及體格智力、都應該有一定的標準、為人民直接謀利益、只要是自已的職務、加在頭上、就該奮不顧身、一往直前、百折不回的去作、所謂“威武不能屈、”那才能為人民謀利益、如日前十六舖一位警長、能冒險禦盜、保障人民、這才够作警察的資格、如果事還沒有作、先顧計報酬薪餉的多寡、那就無事可作了、本市警察、職務繁重、餉給太微、這是不可諱言的事實、但是調查全國、上海市尚不算過低、多有不及、不可以租界警察作比例、大家應痛惜人民的不振作、不量氣、挽救國家的危亡才是、國之不存、家又何在、不管國家待遇如何卑廉、自己是國家一份子、生一日盡一日的赤心、忠心耿耿、堅忍耐勞一致貫澈、那才是“貧賤不能移”呢、不虛榮、不奢華、不受人的利所誘、不為人的財所迷、無論怎樣的收買、不為所動、不喪人格、為公理而奮鬥、為正義而邁進、這呌“富實不能淫、”我們本着这富貴不能淫、貧賤不能移、威武不能屈的眞精神、只要認清那是我們現在所應當做的、我們即毅然决然地去做、不猶疑、不怯懦、不辱使命盡一分力量、即得一分效果、盡一天職務、即得一天成績、這種精神、可以戰勝目前一切的困難、可以使整個民族復興、保障整個民族的生存與安全、</p>
<p>第三要確定我們的動向、推進我們的方策、努力實現我們將來的理想、我們的理想實現與否、看我們的訓練如何、我們的訓練目標、㊀先打破自私自利個人享樂主義的舊觀念、人人從自覺自愛中尊重自己的人格、發展勇敢率真的才能、將自己的才能、貢獻到國家民族上去、㊁培養吃苦任重、任勞任怨的眞精神、無論在怎樣艱難困苦的惡劣環境中、均能設法掙扎努力、同時要充實自己、不示弱不氣餒、戰勝環境、㊂使警察人人富有革命性以備負起改造社會的重大責任、㊃警察要能組織人民訓練人民、共同站在一條救亡的陣綫上、使民衆武力化、武力民衆化、尺衆警察化、警察民衆化、</p>
<p>有了肯負責能領導一般人民的熱烈勇敢率眞的警察、方才能有自覺自救的全民衆、警寮訓練、才是救國救民的良策、復興民族的後備軍所有全體官警人員、應振作起來、緊張起來、確定我們的動向、羣策羣力、推進我們的方策、努力實現我們的理想警察、預備共同發揮整個民族最偉大的力量、盡我們各個人救亡工作的最大貢獻、</p>

<h3>殘酷的對照</h3>
<p>— 洪法</p>
<p>這人間社會裏，有許多事情，看來好像是匪夷所思，其實到很平常。例如走江湖者，常向看客索錢的時候，他就把自己的孩子牽攏來，用脚踩在其肚腹上，這時候觀衆中亦眞有以這殘酷現象為笑樂的。若是有人要問：難道人類眞的就沒有同情心麼？我可以答說：是的！那是“自古已然於今為烈”。人當然，不是生下來就成為這般模樣的，但自從有了私有制度後，人類的同情心就逐漸的消蝕和淡薄了。他們相互間，終日只在瘠人肥己的圈子裏打轉，排斥傾軋與競爭，成為每日的家常便飯，積久的結果自然就養成極端自私的心理了。</p>
<p>就如這回四川的旱災，最重的有四十餘縣，農民欲求食草根樹皮而不得，然而據調查所得，却有當地的豪紳巨吏，囤積了大批食糧故意抬高市價，拒不脫售。說到巨災的成因，我們可以找出根多的理由，說牠是由於封建勢力的剝削使然。然而現在這奇災的造成者，却反而可以坐視他人的死亡而不救，這不是一件奇事嗎？</p>
<p>但可奇的還不止此。據某報的重慶二十四日專電：“二十六年度田賦三徵。現定上半年徵收一次，下半年徵二次，除川西定七月一日開徵外，餘均九月、一日開始，省庫收入，可望漸豐”。</p>
<p>由這電文看來，可見川省雖說大災，但田賦還是要納的而且為一年三徵。四川人民支持生命的能力，眞可說是超乎尋常以上！他們死的死去了，就是幸而活着的，也還在吃無機物以復生，而就使這樣，也還有人要在他們的頭上打主意，認為“粗糠裏可以榨出油”來的。</p>
<p>“省庫的漸豐，和小百姓的日窮，是形成怎樣的一個殘酷對照啊！</p>
<h3>活埋的慘劇</h3>
<p>— 梨耕</p>
<p>記得曾有小孤孀被活埋的新聞，她們受着封建遺毒的桎梏，舊禮敎的毒熖而白白地送了性命。而現在呢，我們國度裏東北的一角，也為了“愛國”而演了大規模的活埋慘劇！這二種人的活埋，同樣地是被壓迫者的遭遇！帝國主義的殘暴侵略和封建遺毒的麻醉戕害，同樣是現階段中國的重大問題。</p>
<p>“北平近訊：東北我愛國份子三百餘人，最近被某方活埋……唯知此事係一漢奸向某方告密，某方乃根據此種吿密，在東北各省之各校逮捕，多為靑年學生，內有一人為偽興安省之敎育廳長，某方認該廳長為首領，行刑時先在某地掘一深坑，三百餘人列於坑邊，對每人頭部先重擊一木棒，然後推入坑內，某廳長為最後被擊入坑之一人，當受擊之前，某廳長要求執刑之某國人允渠有兩分鐘之“精神自由”，某國人許之，該廳長乃高呼“中華民國萬歲”，一句方終，卽被擊入坑，以土捲埋；東北各省無日不在恐怖狀態中云”。</p>
<p>凡是有熱血有正義的人類，讀到了這種消息，誰會不“毛骨悚然”，而繼之以悲憤嘆息呢！</p>
<p>亡省奴的命運早被侵略者握有着的，為了“漢奸的告密”，就可大施其“活理”的毒辣手段，還淡得上什麽公理？在過去東北的同胞，尤其是智識份子，被捕捉殘害的不知多少！然而現在是“變本加厲”地越來越兇了！“愛國”而被“活埋”，可見亡省奴是沒有愛國的自由，但是親愛的同胞畢究犧牲了性命愛着他們的“祖國”了，這為的什麼呢？同樣的百姓，旣淪之於奴隸的命運，旣做奴隸而為了受國而遭到如此殘酷的虐待，這是“孰令致之”呢？東北同胞披肝裂膽的殷切的期望，倒底還祇是失望的回答呀！</p>
<p>靑年是民族的中堅，自不必說，智識靑年更是靑年中的柱石，也沒有人會否認，“保衛靑年培育靑年”的話，已是大人先生們的“時髦話”—可是，當這樣的消息傳到他們耳朵裏的時候，不知會不會感覺到有些警惕？假如老是如此的忍耐著被屠割被殘害，那祇是白白地斷送了“國家的元氣”！</p>
<p>某敎育廳長目睹着三百多個秉持着正義感的靑年同胞，活活地被“當頭”棒推入坑內”，所以在輪到他“一棒”的前兩分鐘，還迸出了“中華民國萬歲”的吼聲，他們期望於他們“祖國”的是何等殷切而急迫！而他的吼聲也够沉痛悲憤了！</p>
<p>因了愛國志士的吼聲，我們該如何的警惕，更該如何的立卽拿事實來安慰他們被埋在“土坑之中”的英靈呢？</p>
<h3>陳媽</h3>
<p>— 芳千</p>
<p>“長根叔…………怎麼，我們的小三病了嗎”？陳媽把洗衣工作暫時停了一下，手裏拿着刷子釘視着長根叔。長根叔，一身黑棉衫褲，鄕土氣，坐在一條木橙上。他昨天纔從鄕下出來，順便給陳媽帶個口信：她兒子病了。</p>
<p>一唔，小三是初三那天返家的，已經走不動，坐着小車回來，據他說：起病是給師父當肚子踢了一脚，心裏就◻鬱悶悶的。晚上打地鋪，又受了風寒，第二天就發熱”。長根叔噓了口氣。</p>
<p>“不要緊嗎”？陳媽嘴角往下一彎，接著嚥一口唾涎，顯見得在着急。</p>
<p>“看樣子，恐怕危………但也許是不要緊的，不過，小三媽，我看挺好你還是回家去看看他。”</p>
<p>“不過我，我這裏，太太不……”突然，另外一個聲音打斷了她的話。</p>
<p>“陳媽，太太喊你”。</p>
<p>“哦哦，馬上就來，長根叔，你回去吧，眞謝謝你，累你跑一趟，現在——去吧。”</p>
<p>陳媽讓長根叔走了，趕緊到太太跟前。太太要她煮蓮心。</p>
<p>陳媽，四十來歲，已經很蒼老了，普通個子，有着二張薄薄的嘴唇，跟人家說話時，老愛這麼好笑地彎一下嘴角接着？就嚥一口唾涎。可是人倒是很忠厚，只是手脚慢些。她洗十件衣服的時間，別人家總可以洗上十五六件。起先，她原是給二小姐當奶媽的。現在，二小姐已有十四歲了，長的活潑聰明，太太因為看她勤勞，二小姐又合她好，所以就留下當女傭了。</p>
<p>陳媽把裝了蓮心的鍋子放在灶上。</p>
<p>猛烈的火光，逼炙着陳媽底死灰似的臉，動也不動，像呆鷄一般的立在灶前，把視綫凝注在牆上。牆有什麼好瞧的，白的粉壁，給柴烟燻成灰黑色，上面設着灶神的神龕。</p>
<p>可是陳媽却從灰黑色的牆中彷彿看見了她的孩子：他見到他的小三用一雙又瘦得一捆柴似的手捧着肚子，滾來滾去的拼命地提起哭啞了的喉嚨在喊着痛。……</p>
<p>“噝—噝—”陳媽突然地给驚醒了。那是蓮心溢到火燄中所發出的聲音。她連忙用匙掏了一下，仍讓它煮着。</p>
<p>接着，陳媽又跌到沉思裏去，但却又給二小姐驚醒了：</p>
<p>“陳媽，你的信”。</p>
<p>“嗯？我的？陳媽頓時黨得一呆。腮巴子在抽動，這一定有蹩扭。“好小姐，那麼請你讀一讀我聽聽，裏面說些</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>什——什麼，不過——慢着。”她記起</p>
<p>那蓮心，怱怱忙忙地端給太太，太太偏</p>
<p>又說：“太淡了，加些糖，”拿了黃糖</p>
<p>又說要白糖眞好吃。陳媽費勁的緊走幾</p>
<p>步，纔結裏結巴地望着二小姐說：“他</p>
<p>不要緊吧。”</p>
<p>“小三病重……無錢請醫生……速回</p>
<p>”“小三是你兒子吧？”</p>
<p>“那怎麼辦呢？那怎麼好？”嘴角往</p>
<p>下彎了一下，又嚥了一口唾涎，抽着腮</p>
<p>巴子轉成通紅。</p>
<p>她决定了。到太太跟前——</p>
<p>“一禮拜，太太……給我去一禮拜”</p>
<p>。不住的嚥唾涎。</p>
<p>“但是我這裏什麼人做事呢？”太太</p>
<p>帶着七成鼻音。</p>
<p>“可憐點兒吧，太太，病——病，他</p>
<p>一好，我馬上回來，可憐——可憐我吧</p>
<p>！”顫聲地幾乎要哭出來的勁兒。</p>
<p>“那末——”太太遲疑了一下子，“</p>
<p>一禮拜一定要回來，否則——</p>
<p>可是一禮拜過去了，陳媽還沒有回</p>
<p>來。</p>
<p>太太急於要用人，另外找了個結實</p>
<p>的强健的。</p>
<p>第十天的大清早，陳媽挟着包袱來</p>
<p>，臉色更蒼白，眼圈發黑。</p>
<p>“你來遲了，我已等不到你回來”太</p>
<p>太冷冷地，“把蓮心碗拿去洗了，張媽”</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>陳媽霎時一愕，眼皮低垂下來，但</p>
<p>立刻她明白了：但這不是哀求能得到效</p>
<p>果的事情，於是她鬆一鬆肩，把背脊挺</p>
<p>直一下，好像沒有這回事似的：“太太</p>
<p>我走了。”於是眞的走了。</p>
<p>憑着力氣去賣錢，她已經沒有孩子</p>
<p>，也不憂慮，也不害怕，“憑着我這副</p>
<p>老骨頭掙飯吃”。她想。</p>
<h3>鄕下小擷</h3>
<p>— 葉家怡</p>
<p>㊀孤宅</p>
<p>我彷彿是一個晉代的漁人，闖入這別有天地的人間來。當神沉於這實境中的幻想時，俗塵的縈念，人事的紛爭，眞覺有不勝愚庸的感慨惆悵！</p>
<p>這三椽古色的平屋，蒼老中見出牠的矍鑠與超然：牠遮蔽那具着土地生死的前一代人們，又保護着他們的子子孫孫。牠懷着平和的心，要永遠溫存他們成天疲勞的心身。這維繫着忠誠的深情，如一的，朴實的；像人們對於他們的土地。</p>
<p>門前一灣的河方死寂地像一個久遠深潭，綠絮似的浮苔很容易意識到欲雨的青天。凝着的雲塊：野菱的葉子與圓圓的浮萍錯雜地交織着的圖案中，還綴着一隻繫在柳蔭下的小舟。這洒脫超越的風趣，誰能不幻入非人間的仙境！</p>
<p>說這是仙境也該不是過分吧！天堂與地獄互異的精髓，不是快樂與苦痛麼！這裏，他們是活在離開文明現世的古代樂境裏的，當父親的從附近的田間挑着一束束金黃色的麥穗走進籬門時，女兒與家犬是現着怎樣的眞情去迎接這一家之主啊：這恬蜜的安慰的逸趣，怕不是那些自謂在天堂裏的人們所能享的吧，他們的憂患不是投資的失敗，勢利的隳落，更不是愛情糾纏的魔障；只要是一田的榖物長出豐裕的穗頭，籬邊的家禽沒有疾病，或今朝的蔬菜能在集鎮上換得一家的粗飯，那便是他們的太平日子了！他們樸實的農民的心夢也是活在士地的氣息裏。</p>
<p>叢叢的蔭影蓋住這古屋的平頂，掩住這些簡單的靈魂；孤宅中代代的人們，只是把他們祖父遺傳下的故事重述給他們的孩子，在星星熌熌着的夜晚，階下與田野的虫聲凑着天堂的霓裳之曲詩。</p>
<p>——做一個誠實的農民……我想到俄羅斯一個詩人的句子來。</p>
<p>㊁竹林</p>
<p>在明耀奪目的陽光中能給你焦渴的心一點陰爽的感覺，便是這裏的竹林了。那叢叢的一帶，鮮明的，新綠得不是人工可着色的葉子，湧溢出多麼富裕蓬勃的生命的靑春啊。錯落新長的嫩竹，剛脫下牠從土地中帶來的籮衣，支撑得多麼的◻娜，那亭亭細小的裸體，使人會意想到古畫中的仙子的伴舞來。</p>
<p>自家是生長在山谷裏竹林中的人，我們的祖父，父親都靠着牠們養活他們的後代，竹林從我們生下新的一代，於是老的竹娘，就被我們砍伐了，放下水賣給城裏的人們。牠們繼代的生長，我們也繼代的砍伐，但到了我們不肖的一代，不住地去戕伐青春的竹笋時，終於我們的林園廢坍了！而接着我們的家也破滅了</p>
<p>如今這異地密箐的園林，使我惦記起遙遠故鄕那片荒毀了的山林！少時祖父常說“在山靠山，在海靠海”這一類的故事，但他永也想不到山外的人們會有侵到山林的一日！誠實的山人會自己破毀了他們的財產滅亡的。</p>
<p>默坐在竹蔭的石上，我搖着在竹上刻着兒年的夢境輕唸着一個少女給我的歌聲。</p>

<p>那韓國人帶着個七八歲的男孩子，很瘦，臉小眼圓，皮色醬黑，活潑而調皮，誰看他一眼，他就翻起雙小白眼珠聯你半響從這隻鐵筒跳上那隻，在風浪㨪動中，一點不害怕，有時跌下來，不哭不呌，摸摸摔痛了的地方，仍然那麼躍跳，在下艙蓋的上面，睡着一個十二三歲的小麻子，這小高麗用吐沫望那麻臉上甩，弄醒了，他捏着拳頭追過去，當他回來重睡下不久，高麗就又回來撩他的耳朶，或打他身旁跳圈，兩個不同國籍的孩子追來趕去的鬧，作父親的高麗人笑着，看熱鬧的中國人也笑着，並讚賞的說：</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Issues a Letter to Students Serving in Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Gather opinions from farmers to relieve their suffering. Investigate and correct the bad habits of local agencies and organizations.</p>
<p>[Jiujiang] Guling telephone report: After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a speech on the 15th soliciting students to serve in rural areas during the summer vacation, university students across the country rose up to follow suit, all determined to serve in the countryside. Chiang issued another notice to the students serving in the rural areas on the 28th, supplementing the main points. The original text is as follows: "Students, you have now decided to serve in the countryside. Regarding the meaning and essentials of service, I have already stated the general outline in the previous solicitation letter. Now, I will add the following important points: 1. Rural service should not only guide society and help farmers, but also try to collect the opinions of farmers as much as possible and deeply understand the difficulties of the countryside, study improvements and find ways to solve them. But do not use interference and coercion. For local agencies and gentry, we should cooperate sincerely and approach them with a sincere attitude and a spirit of mutual assistance. 2. Local agencies and organizations, such as the police baojia, etc., should vigorously prohibit places that harbor dirt and filth, such as opium, drugs, prostitution, gambling dens, and obscene and unhealthy dramas. We should also earnestly investigate whether the various organizations, actions, and facilities in the area violate the spirit and regulations of the New Life Movement, and cooperate with local officials and gentry to earnestly correct them. 3. Rural customs and habits vary, and we must not judge right and wrong with intuition. We must carefully study the origins of customs and habits. Those that are unimportant need not be questioned. If it is considered necessary to reform, we should always advise the local authorities to gradually change them. We must never be too hasty, which will not help in practice and will only hurt the feelings of the countryside. In short, you are going out to serve in order to do your best to relieve the suffering of the people and improve social ills, so that all compatriots can practice the New Life Movement and establish the foundation for national revival. Therefore, you must work hard and not have the slightest selfish desire for fame and fortune, so that you can truly understand the meaning of service." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Speaking to British People about the British-Japanese Negotiations</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Negotiations between Great Britain and Japan regarding issues in the Far East are soon to formally begin. Although both sides have repeatedly stated that these negotiations will focus primarily on commercial matters, with Chinese issues secondary, attention from all parties has already concentrated on the Chinese question during this initial contact phase. This is not accidental. The so-called Far Eastern issue is essentially centered on the Chinese problem, and the core of current Far Eastern disputes lies in Japan's aggression against China. Since September 1931, this aggression has been constantly developing and has not yet ceased. Therefore, as soon as news of the British-Japanese negotiations emerged, attention from all levels of our country immediately focused on the damage suffered by our country's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and administrative integrity in Manchuria and North China.</p>
<p>Due to the anxiety expressed by various sectors of our country, British Foreign Secretary Eden has repeatedly stated that the upcoming negotiations will not harm China's sovereignty or sacrifice China's interests. Yesterday's Nanjing dispatch from the Central News Agency also clarified two key points regarding our government's attitude toward the British-Japanese negotiations: ㊀ that China's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and administrative integrity must be respected in all matters involving China; ㊁ that China's opinions must be consulted and our country's consent obtained in advance. We welcome Foreign Secretary Eden's statement. At the same time, in light of the attitude expressed by our government, we further hope that British officials, upon seeing this, will exercise even greater caution during the negotiations. This is because international diplomatic negotiations often appear very fair on the surface but ultimately end up sacrificing a third party.</p>
<p>Our reason for expressing such anxiety and hoping that the British authorities will proceed cautiously is not unfounded speculation but rather based on evidence. First, from a basic standpoint, we dare not expect that Great Britain, during its negotiations with Japan, will prioritize China's interests over its own, as we are well aware of the pragmatism of British Conservative Party politicians. Second, while Foreign Secretary Eden's statement is comforting, the many striking expressions in various British and Japanese newspapers prevent us from feeling relieved. When news of the British-Japanese negotiations first emerged last month, the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, in a state of ecstatic frenzy, headlined "Our North China—Not British China, Not South China." At the same time, it stated with an air of absolute certainty that "Great Britain recognizes the existence of Manchukuo as an accomplished fact." It is unnecessary to dwell on the Japanese newspapers' habit of extravagant exaggeration, but even the important mouthpiece of the Conservative Party, the "Morning Post," in its editorial on March 27 responding to Foreign Minister Sato's speech, also stated that "Whether recognized or not, the existence of Manchukuo is almost recognized as an accomplished fact even by China." Therefore, "the most important part of adjusting relations in the Far East is to exclude Manchukuo and guarantee the integrity of the rest of China." We believe that under the Conservative Party's governance, the "Morning Post" reflects the British government's foreign policy attitude more accurately than the "Times." With such an important organ of public opinion believing that our country can tacitly acknowledge the puppet state of Manchukuo, created by the aggressor, as an accomplished fact, we cannot help but feel deep anxiety about the upcoming British-Japanese negotiations in addition to our humiliation.</p>
<p>However, we believe that, given Great Britain's recent close relationship with our country, it should understand the strength that our country has gained in peaceful unification and development. This strength is most evident in public opinion. No one in China today is willing to associate with the aggressor, and the dismemberment of the four northeastern provinces and the dissection of parts of North China are deeply painful wounds that cannot be forgotten for a moment. If Great Britain wishes to cherish its friendship with China, it must not blindly accommodate others and disregard China's significant wounds. In recent years, the friendship between China and Great Britain has indeed improved considerably. In particular, Great Britain's assistance to China, both materially and spiritually, is most appreciated. Currently, our people consider countries such as Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to be friendly nations with whom we can be close and cooperate. However, as former Japanese Foreign Minister Sato said, "Great Britain has regained a position of advantage in China through its efforts over the past ten years." This statement is worth considering carefully. We sincerely hope that enlightened individuals in Great Britain will cherish the friendship that has been gradually repaired and cultivated over these ten years and not easily abandon it due to short-term temptations of self-interest.</p>
<h3>Joint Conference of Japanese, Korean, and "Manchu" Industrial Representatives to be Held</h3>
<p>Scheduled for Autumn in Korea; Governor-General Minami Meets with Minister Otani</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Governor-General of Korea Minami Jiro met with Minister Otani on the 26th, explaining the guiding principles for Korea's industry and economy, which will be implemented in accordance with the central government's three financial and economic principles. Governor-General Minami plans to invite representatives from the industrial sectors of Japan, Manchuria, and Korea to Seoul this autumn to hold a liaison conference on Japanese-Korean-"Manchu" economic and industrial affairs. He also requested that representatives from the Planning Board, the Colonial Affairs Ministry, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry attend as observers to discuss and harmonize the industries and economies of Japan, Korea, and "Manchuria." (Daimyo dispatch, dated the 28th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] When Governor-General of Korea Minami Jiro met with Colonial Affairs Minister Otani Sonryu on the 26th of this month, he suggested holding a conference in Seoul to connect the industries and economies of the Japanese mainland, Korea, and Manchuria. Both sides have agreed to hold the conference this coming autumn. Representatives from the business and industrial circles of the Japanese mainland, Korea, and Manchuria, as well as from the Manchurian Affairs Bureau, the Kwantung Army, and the Korean Army, will participate. Representatives from the Planning Board, the Colonial Affairs Ministry, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will also be invited to attend as observers. As Korea's importance in realizing the so-called "Japan-Manchu Integration" axis is increasing, this upcoming conference, which aims to eliminate the various contradictions that have already arisen between the Japanese mainland and Korea, between Korea and Manchuria, and between the Japanese mainland and Manchuria, is of great significance. Furthermore, the conference is noteworthy because it intends to lay the groundwork for the work of the Central Economic Conference. The selection of representatives to attend the conference has been informally decided by the cabinet, but the official system has not yet been promulgated.

<h3>Submarine Volcanic Eruption Near the Northern Kuril Islands</h3>
<p>Potential Discovery of a New Island</p>
<p>Sapporo According to a telegram from the Pacific Fisheries Company's office in Kataoka Bay, Shumshu Island, Northern Kuril Islands, to the company's head office in Hakodate, there is a very intense submarine volcanic eruption in the sea near the Strait of Onnekotan, south of Paramushir Island, Northern Kuril Islands. However, the time and details of the eruption are unknown and are currently being investigated. In March 1934, there was a submarine eruption in the sea east of Shimushiru Island in the Northern Kuril Islands, which later led to the discovery of Takefuto Island (named after Takefuto, the captain of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's monitoring ship), about one ri in circumference. It is possible that a new island will be discovered this time as well. (Daimyo dispatch, dated the 28th)</p>

<p>Radek's Pardon Unconfirmed</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Director of Aviation Affairs of Leningrad Port, Blancstein, was arrested today, accused of colluding with a certain foreign consul through his assistants to secretly damage sixteen ships. Blancstein is Trotsky's nephew, making this the second member of Trotsky's family to be arrested.

<p>[London] According to reports from Moscow and the Far East, a large number of railway personnel, Red Army soldiers, and government officials in the Soviet Far East have been arrested. The commander of the Vladivostok Soviet fleet and the director of the Heilongjiang Railway Bureau have also been arrested, it is said. The Moscow News has confirmed that many key members of the Siberian Railway and a large number of workers have been arrested by the secret police, allegedly for "being directed by a certain neighboring country in the Far East" to carry out espionage and sabotage. (National Maritime Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] According to foreign sources, the famous Soviet journalist Radek, who was sentenced to imprisonment in the past for the Counter-Revolutionary Parallel Center case, was recently granted amnesty for reporting meritorious service in the case of the Red Army Chief of General Staff Tukhachevsky's betrayal of the country. However, the authorities here have firmly denied this, and it is also said that rumors that the former Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee, Rykov, and the former editor of Pravda, Bukharin (both in prison), have escaped by plane and their whereabouts are unknown are also unconfirmed. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Paris Evening News recently received a telegram from its Riga correspondent, stating that, according to responsible sources in Moscow, the famous Soviet journalist Radek, who was sentenced to imprisonment in January last year for involvement in the Trotskyite Parallel Center case, was granted amnesty by the Communist Party's Politburo two months ago. It is said that this was because Radek's reporting of meritorious service in the case of former Chief of General Staff Tukhachevsky's rebellion led to the amnesty. It is noted that during the trial of the Parallel Center case in January of this year, Radek once mentioned the collusion between Tukhachevsky and certain conspirators, but later, before Prosecutor General Vyshinsky, he suddenly retracted his testimony.

<h3>Near East Political Situation</h3>
<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Goes to Iran</p>
<p>Capital of Iraq: Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü arrived here on the 22nd of this month and, after holding talks with the Iraqi authorities, has proceeded to the capital of Iran for a visit. According to a joint communiqué issued after the talks, the discussions were friendly and sincere, proving that the policies pursued by both sides are aimed at maintaining international peace and general prosperity within the scope of respecting international alliances and existing treaties. At the same time, both sides are willing to promote friendly relations with neighboring countries. Therefore, Iraq will send a delegation to Iran to extend the spirit of cooperation between Iraq and Turkey to Iran. Based on the results of these talks, the Iraqi government has now begun diplomatic activities and has appointed a delegation to go to the Iranian capital to negotiate a draft political agreement and other agreements to define the general relations between the two countries. It is generally believed that this delegation's trip may result in the prior signing of a political agreement between Iraq and Iran, before the signing of a non-aggression pact between Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan. Relations between Iraq and Egypt are also very satisfactory. The Iraqi government recently hired Egyptian experts to guide the construction of large-scale water conservancy projects. In addition, Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas is scheduled to visit here in October of this year, and the friendly relations between the two sides will be confirmed at that time.

<h3>The Political and Economic Influence of Japan's No. 1 Zaibatsu, Mitsui (2)</h3>
<p>— Nan Yun</p>
<p>(3) Turning from Being Threatened by Fascism to Leading Fascism</p>
<p>After the "September 18th Incident" occurred, the Japanese military and the public felt the threat of war even more.</p>
<p>Even though the military was constantly demonstrating against China, the lessons of the arduous struggle of the Northeast Volunteer Army and the complexity of international relations finally shook the military, and they shouted the slogans of "expanding armaments" and "strengthening national defense."</p>
<p>The "strengthening national defense" advocated by the military was the so-called "broadly defined strengthening of national defense." The main point was to relieve and restore the rural areas. Soldiers mostly came from farming families, and this slogan represented the wishes of the lower-level soldiers. However, sacrificing the rural areas was one of the conditions for the development of Japanese capitalism. Therefore, under the slogan of "restoring the rural areas," an anti-zaibatsu intention was naturally brewing. After the "September 18th Incident," Japanese fascists did their best to oppose the zaibatsu, and the last one they opposed was Mitsui, because Mitsui was the largest of the zaibatsu.</p>
<p>However, society is a capitalist society, and no matter what, capitalists always control the leadership of society, and all the greatest benefits inevitably fall into the hands of the zaibatsu. — Please look at Mitsui after the "September 18th Incident"!</p>
<p>Mitsui Toyo Cotton Company and Bussan Company developed even more after "September 18th." The capital of Mitsui Trust increased by 68.7 million yen compared to 1932 (according to a 1936 survey). The capital of Mitsui Life Insurance also increased by 8.151 million yen. Despite the military's chanting of anti-zaibatsu slogans, the result of aggression and the result of war were still nothing more than increasing profits for capital.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the zaibatsu used the opportunity of colonial expansion to suppress the domestic left-wing movement. At the same time, they were more actively planning how to bring the right-wing camp that was chanting "anti-zaibatsu" into their own arms. Therefore, they adopted the strategy of "taking one step back and two steps forward," which was the "Mitsui's Turnaround" that shocked Japanese society.</p>
<p>Slightly dividing out a bit of profit to be used for social undertakings—that was Mitsui's turnaround. From 1932 to 1936, Mitsui's donations to social undertakings totaled more than 12.529 million yen, plus an investment of 10 million yen in "Manchukuo" and 30 million yen in membership fees for the Hoonkai (established by Mitsui with the aim of developing culture and improving society), totaling more than 62 million yen. This was a manifestation of Mitsui's turnaround. Naturally, this amount accounted for only a very small portion of Mitsui's total capital (according to a survey by the Japanese tax authorities, Mitsui's income in 1934 increased by 50% compared to before the "September 18th Incident"). However, just this very small amount was enough to strike a blow to the fascist radicals.</p>
<p>In today's upper echelons of the Japanese military, the radical fascists have failed, and the so-called gradualists are the most powerful, while Mitsui is still planning how to thoroughly lead the fascists.</p>
<p>In a period when the contradiction between the productive forces created by capitalism and the capitalist mode of production has reached the general crisis of capitalism, the bourgeoisie often shifts to the open dictatorship of fascism. The Japanese zaibatsu are currently taking this path. But—if the fascist forces in Japan are not under the leadership of capitalists, then the capitalists will have to spend a little more effort.</p>
<p>Now, let's turn back and look at Mitsui's social undertakings after the "September 18th Incident":</p>
<p>1.  Donations related to national defense and military affairs: For example, 50,000 yen for the "Shanghai Dispatch Army慰問金" after the "January 28th Incident," 100,000 yen for Kyoto national defense expenses, 500,000 yen for the Patriotic Support Soldiers Association...etc.</p>
<p>2.  Donations to academic and cultural undertakings: For example, 300,000 yen for the Japan Cultural League计尽助成金 (those who can receive this助成金 are limited to cultural groups with a right-wing ideological system)...etc.</p>
<p>3.  Donations to international organizations: For example, 300,000 yen for the Good Neighborliness協 Association费 (few outsiders know about this organization. Its purpose is purely to consider the current situation of the Mongolian people, promote cultural facilities in various parts of Mongolia, assist in the development of Mongolian industry, promote Japanese-Mongolian trade, and operate the Good Neighborliness Association Library, which provides education with Japanese national policy characteristics and guides Mongolian students studying in Japan), 50,000 yen for the Patriotic Women's Association fund...etc.</p>
<p>4.  Donations to "Manchuria" and Korea: For example, 150,000 yen for the construction of the Korean Comprehensive Museum, 50,000 yen for the construction of the Jingbo Academy in "Manchuria" (an educational institution for immigrant groups that has now been dissolved due to frequent attacks by volunteer soldiers), 100,000 yen for the construction of the "Manchukuo" Student Hall in Japan...etc.</p>
<p>In addition to the various donations listed above, there are many kinds of donations related to schools, sports...etc. In total, Mitsui's social donations in the past five years have reached more than 40 million yen (excluding the investment in "Manchuria"). Although this money was not entirely donated by Mitsui voluntarily, it has indeed liberated Mitsui from the threat of fascism and transitioned it to a position of leading fascism.

<h3>Rumors of Sino-British Loan Agreement in Tokyo</h3>
<p>A Total of £10 Million for Development and Construction, U.S. Authorities Prepare to Receive Mr. Kung</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Rumors that a British loan of £10 million to China has been finalized are rampant here. It is believed that this loan is purely for assisting China's construction and does not contain any political significance. According to a special London dispatch from the Asahi Shimbun, regarding the loan to China, the British government is very eager to obtain Japan's cooperation. One of the reasons given is the integrity of China's customs administration, as customs revenue is the main guarantee for the loan and is highly dependent on Japan's cooperation. The report also stated that if Japan refuses to cooperate, Britain will provide loans to China alone or in cooperation with the United States. It is reported that Foreign Minister Hirota is prepared to actively support the British proposal. However, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated this morning that the Japanese government has not yet received the British government's proposal for a loan to China. Whether Japan will cooperate with Britain after receiving the proposal depends on future circumstances. Observers here believe that Japan is deliberately exaggerating the Sino-British loan negotiations, as they believe that the British government does not seem to be keeping secrets from Japan regarding the talks held by Mr. Kung Hsiang-hsi in London. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[New York] Before going to Washington today, Chinese Finance Minister Kung Hsiang-hsi met with Mr. Lamont of Morgan Bank and other bankers and reached an agreement to resolve the $5 million loan from the Pacific Construction Bank. The resolution will be officially announced soon. According to Mr. Lamont, Minister Kung's resolution of this loan is an honor for China. China's unification has now been completed, and a new five-year economic plan will be implemented. China welcomes foreign cooperation for this great development, and the United States will certainly occupy a very important position in this. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Finance Minister Dr. Kung Hsiang-hsi will arrive here tomorrow. Secretary of State Hull will meet with Mr. Kung first and then invite him to lunch. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau is scheduled to host a banquet for Mr. Kung on Tuesday evening. Other government officials have already arranged appointments with Mr. Kung. The timing of Roosevelt's meeting is still undecided because the "Jefferson Island celebration banquet" has not yet ended. Authoritative sources here believe that the talks between Mr. Kung and U.S. officials will be very harmonious. As for whether the two sides will discuss other construction-related projects this time, there is much speculation here. It is understood that if Mr. Kung has any suggestions, he will at least receive sympathy from the U.S. side, as U.S. officials have fundamentally changed their views on China's political and economic situation. Some officials even expressed private opinions, saying that China's attraction to investors is improving daily. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Finances</h3>

<h3>U.S. Labor Strike</h3>
<p>Steelworkers Plan to Destroy Water Source</p>
<p>Warren, Ohio: Agitators among the striking workers at a steel plant here have issued threats to blow up the floodgates of the Meander Creek Reservoir, the source of drinking water for Niles and Johnstown. The reservoir has a storage capacity of 30 million cubic meters. If the floodgates are blown up, the surrounding area will become a swamp. Therefore, the area around the floodgates has been defended by troops, and armed patrol boats are guarding the reservoir to prevent the banks from being sabotaged.

<p>Chicago: The strike of 19,000 employees of Inland Steel Company and Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company here has lasted for many days. The two companies have now decided to resume work on the 29th, after obtaining the necessary protection. The mayor of East Chicago has specially requested the governor of Indiana to immediately dispatch troops and declare martial law so that order can be maintained and the threat of striking workers avoided when the factories open.

<h3>French New Finance Minister Bonnet Returns Home</h3>
<p>Striving for Sound Finances</p>
<p>Cherbourg, France: French former Ambassador to the United States Bonnet, who was transferred to be the Finance Minister of the new cabinet, returned home on the Queen Mary ocean liner and landed here today. When speaking to reporters, he said that he agreed with Prime Minister Chautemps that it was better not to express opinions at the moment. He dared to tell everyone that he would resolutely fight to stop speculation and manipulation and would prohibit all abuse and fraud. The budget must be restored to soundness. In short, France's finances should be as strong as France's army and navy. He then said that he was very interested in the work he had done in the United States. Many Americans expressed sympathy for us, and he was very sorry to leave the United States and return home. The United States is a great and unparalleled country, and he now believes more than ever that cooperation between France and the United States is absolutely necessary. Bonnet took a car to Paris at 8:15 a.m. The Undersecretary of Finance, Brunaud, went to the dock to greet him today and then returned to Paris in the same car with Bonnet, where they held discussions in the car.

<h3>Ninth Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Opens in Berlin</p>
<p>[Berlin] The Ninth Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce opened this morning. Head of State Hitler and all members of the cabinet, as well as the diplomatic corps, attended. The opening speech was delivered by the Chairman of the German Branch of the International Chamber of Commerce, the Honorary Chairman of the Congress, Flören, who emphasized that increasing production is necessary for the benefit of mankind. Then, the dictator of the Four-Year Plan, Minister of Aviation Göring, delivered a speech, praising the achievements of the Nazi Party and saying, "The German people are determined to have peace. If, after four years, Germany's Four-Year Plan is completed and it is strong enough to defend itself, there will be no risk of war. Moreover, Germany's attitude towards the recent provocations by the Reds in Spain is enough to reflect Germany's desire for peace. As for Germany's need to organize a strong and comprehensive military, this is due to the fact that other countries are unwilling to follow Germany's example and implement disarmament. At present, if Germany's various living needs cannot be met, then Germany will never abandon its attention to the colonial issue, because there is no other way for the German people to survive and prosper economically." Minister of Economic Affairs Schacht also gave a speech, saying, "Germany must seek solutions to both the problem of necessities of life and the problem of military supplies. If these two problems can be solved by restoring the stability of currency and the even distribution of production, then the German economic National Socialism can disappear."

<h3>Hitler's Speech: Striving for Self-Defense from Now On</h3>
<p>No Longer Deceived by Collective Security; Basque Minerals Cause Controversy</p>
<p>[Berlin] Head of State Hitler gave a speech to 200,000 Nazi Party members in Würzburg, Bavaria, today, giving a humorous account of the work of the Non-Intervention Committee. He said that after the German cruiser Leipzig was attacked outside the port of Valencia, the Non-Intervention Committee did not listen to the German navy's request for a demonstration, which was enough to prove that if Germany encountered something more serious than this, it would inevitably rise up and oppose it. He then said that the Non-Intervention Committee should recognize that Germany's experience in Spain is a lesson that can never be forgotten. "From now on, when such incidents occur, we would rather automatically seize the freedom, independence, honor, and security that the country should have to defend ourselves, and thank God that our ability to defend ourselves is more than sufficient." Hitler also said that the purpose of Germany's Four-Year Plan is to defend the country from being deceived by third powers, and there is no force that can move Germany even an inch away from this plan. Hitler also expressed Germany's need to buy iron ore from foreign countries. Regarding the Spanish incident, Hitler frankly declared that Germany very much hopes for the victory of the Nationalist army, because after the situation is calm, Germany can make a deal with the iron mines in Bilbao. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[London] After hearing that German Head of State Hitler said in a speech in Würzburg yesterday that Germany would like to see all of Spain controlled by the Nationalist army so that it would be easy to obtain iron ore, the British side was extremely uneasy, as this iron ore is also urgently needed by Britain. The Basque Autonomous Region of Spain is rich in iron ore, and the ore produced is mostly purchased by British merchants. Even after the fall of the port of Bilbao, these merchants still wanted to trade as usual. Regarding this matter, the Nationalist government had provided guarantees to the British government, but it was feared that after German Head of State Hitler made the above declaration, the Nationalist authorities would break their promise or reduce sales. In view of this, the British government is very willing to restore the consulate in the port of Bilbao in order to conduct negotiations. The Nationalist government refused on the grounds that the passports issued were not recognized as valid by the United Kingdom, and the two sides are still in negotiations.

<h3>British and French Surveillance of the Spanish Sea</h3>
<p>Germany and Italy Can Agree</p>
<p>[London] Responsible German sources here recently declared that Germany will not oppose the surveillance of the Spanish sea by British and French warships, provided that British warships monitor the sea under the jurisdiction of the Spanish government forces and French warships monitor the sea under the jurisdiction of the Nationalist forces. It is said that the United Kingdom and France can accept this condition. As for hiring observers to monitor the warships, it is said that the German government wants to appoint people from Germany, Italy, and Portugal. The subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss this case. The German government has also ordered its ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ribbentrop, to stay in Berlin temporarily so that he can bring the German reply back to London after understanding the contents of the plans proposed by the United Kingdom and France. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Burgos: According to an announcement by the Spanish Nationalist authorities, after the Nationalist army took Bilbao, the national population under its jurisdiction is approximately 14 million, while the population under the jurisdiction of the government forces is approximately 7.96 million. The announcement also stated that the minerals of the entire province of Biscay are now in the hands of the Nationalist army, and the war in the Basque region has entered an irregular mode. It seems that the government forces' troops no longer have the ability to adjust and counterattack. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>Bordeaux, France: 238 refugees from the Spanish port of Santander came to France for refuge on the steamer "Berosquerque" and landed here today. According to Simon, a representative of the Bilbao Relief Committee who came with them, there are currently no fewer than 400,000 refugees gathered in the port of Santander, of whom more than 10,000 are injured. There is a shortage of food and medicine there, especially alcohol and "ether." In surgeries, gasoline is even used to replace anesthetics. There is almost no space in the hospitals, and the wounded are lying on the ground, groaning in pain. As for the Basque Autonomous Region's troops, although they have retreated to the city of Talabera, their courage is truly admirable. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Central Executive Committee Commends Arctic Expedition Team Members</h3>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet Central Executive Committee decided to award Soviet medals of all levels to 31 staff members of the Arctic Ocean Route Administration for their outstanding achievements in conquering the Arctic Ocean, especially in preparing for Arctic exploration, in order to reward them.

<h3>Details of the Conclusion of the Yunnan-Burma Boundary Survey</h3>
<p>Kunming Aviation News: The Liang and Zhang Commissioners of the Yunnan-Burma Boundary Survey Committee, along with all the staff of the office, have arrived in Kunming for several days. The details of the closing of the meeting are disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>The committee held a total of one hundred and sixteen meetings. The last meeting was held on April 23rd this year at the British camp in Zhonglong. Previously, the voting on important cases, the drawing of maps, and the discussion of the general report had all been completed. The last meeting was a formal announcement of the closing. During the meeting, the neutral Chairman, Mr. Iselin, gave a speech, the gist of which was that the committee was now formally declared closed and that he wished to express his gratitude to the representatives of both sides, as well as to the surveying, security, medical, and communications personnel. Next, Mr. Liang Yuhao from our side gave a speech, saying, "Now, before the completion of this meeting, I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words to everyone. I express my deepest gratitude and admiration to the Chairman. The Chairman presided over the meeting with wisdom and sagacity, high moral character, and experienced skill. Since the opening of the meeting, we have been able to agree or disagree with all the resolutions and justifications he has put forward, and they are all worthy of our praise. His command of affairs is orderly, his interpretation of phenomena is eloquent, his writing is precise and thoughtful, and his arguments are thorough and impartial, which is the characteristic of his arguments. His high moral character and skillful conduct in guiding the meeting have enabled everything to proceed smoothly; otherwise, the difficulties and thorny situations would have been unpredictable. Therefore, after we leave the border, the good memories of our work will remain in our minds forever."</p>
<p>Commissioner Liang then expressed his gratitude to Mr. Pratt, the secretary of the neutral chairman, saying that since Mr. Pratt took office as the secretary of the committee, he had undertaken arduous meeting affairs. Although he did not hold the title, he actually bore the responsibility. Especially his calm and perseverance in mediating between the representatives of both sides was worthy of praise as a capable talent. Mr. Liang also expressed his gratitude to Mr. Anjun, the leader of the British surveying team.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang added, "As the saying goes, without two parties, there would be no cause for disputes. But here in Wuning, it can be said that without two parties, there would be no cause for cooperation. This friendly cooperation of mutual understanding is what the representatives of both sides have experienced this time. Therefore, it has aroused my gratitude to the British commissioners and their staff for their friendship. I believe that with this spirit of friendship and mutual understanding, and with the results of the two surveys and the success of the chairman, the long-standing problem can be resolved satisfactorily, which is not difficult. After the boundary issue is resolved satisfactorily, future plans to build railways or other transportation facilities, and to mutually develop border resources, will naturally lead to the prosperity of commerce and friendly exchanges between Yunnan and Burma."</p>
<p>Then, the British Commissioner spoke, expressing satisfaction with the guidance given by the Chinese Commissioners and the Chairman. He also shared the same opinion as Mr. Liang in praising Mr. Pratt. He thanked the Chinese representatives for the surveying team and all the auxiliary work for their kindness, and further said that, except for the debates on various special points in the meeting, the relationship between each other in this meeting was very good. This final boundary work will definitely be determined, which is the same hope as the Chinese Commissioner. After the boundary is determined, traffic will definitely improve, and it is possible to open up highways or build railways. The relationship between Burma and Yunnan will definitely be closer in the future, which can be asserted.</p>
<p>After the meeting was completed, the general report and maps remained to be signed (on April 24th). On the evening of the 23rd, a mountain peak with an altitude of 5,000 feet suddenly experienced a violent storm, tents were blown away, and the sky was as dark as ink, as if to decorate the farewell before the end of this long meeting. Shortly afterwards, a rainbow appeared on the horizon, as if to celebrate the peaceful resolution of this boundary work. At dawn on the 24th, the neutral committee and our camp were busy with departure and packing. At 11:00 am, the participants gathered on time, and the general report and the attached maps were signed. Everyone said, "We have been waiting for this day for three years." At noon that day, the British hosted a banquet for the neutral committee, the Chinese committee, and the secretaries. At 3:00 pm, the guests and hosts dispersed happily. The neutral Commissioner Iselin and Secretary Pratt, and our Commissioners Liang and Zhang and the secretaries, immediately mounted their horses and set off, and thus the three-year survey came to an end, and each returned home.</p>
<p>The neutral commissioners and secretaries spent the evening in Bangsang. Our commissioners rushed back to Meng'a in our territory that day. Meng'a and Bangsang are only separated by a river, the Nanka River, which is the dividing river. This evening happened to be the full moon of the lunar calendar, and the moon was as bright as a painting. Our commissioners specially invited the neutral chairman and his secretary, Mr. Pratt, to dinner at the Meng'a camp. All our secretaries and directors attended to accompany them. At 8:00 pm, the guests arrived, and girls from Menghe presented flowers to the neutral commissioner. After entering the seats, the youth and girls of Ameng performed songs and dances. For a time, drums and music were played together, and the tunes were melodious. The banquet lasted until 10:00 pm, and the guests and hosts dispersed happily.</p>
<p>The neutral commissioners returned to Switzerland via Burma. Our commissioners stayed in Meng'a for another day. Nearby residents came to our camp to admire their demeanor in an endless stream, and offered local products as a sign of respect. Afterwards, they passed through various Han ethnic villages, and the local people came to admire them and offered sugar, rice, chickens, and birds as gifts. Our commissioners all gave encouragement. The entire itinerary passed through the territory of Lancang County and the area of Nanjiao, Fohai, Cheli, and Sipu, and returned to Kunming.</p>
<p>The arrival time in Kunming was May 24th, which corresponded to the departure time, just one month's journey. The personnel there traveled an average of seventy to eighty li per day. The shortest journey was forty li per day, and the longest journey was one hundred and twenty li per day. They were in a hurry and had very few opportunities to rest. Except for resting for one day in Meng'a and Puer, the rest were all double-time journeys. Every day, they got up at 4:00 am and set off at 5:00 am, with the stars and moon in the sky and the roosters crowing. The sound of bells and whips was heard again and again on the road. Every day, when they arrived at the campsite, they continued to work tirelessly.</p>
<p>When Liang and Zhang passed through Meng'a, they admired the boundary pioneers Liu (Wansheng) and Chen (Can) and erected a stone monument in their memory.</p>
<p>When passing through Nanjiao, Fohai, and Cheli counties, Liang and Zhang briefly inquired about the local people's livelihood. Seeing the vast fertile land and sparse population, they believed that it was imperative to help domestic unemployment, strengthen border defenses, and colonize the border. As they approached Simao and Ning'er on their return journey, the climate became hotter. The area also lacked water sources. The mountains were bare, the sun was scorching, and the sand and stones were radiating heat, as if melting gold. In the afternoon, due to the rush, they proceeded as usual and rested only at 6:00 pm. From Sipu down, the merchants and travelers coming and going at each station stayed in the horse shops. The facilities in the horse shops were very simple. Stables and stoves were used as makeshift sleeping places. Mosquitoes and flies gathered, and the diet was not balanced. The number of sick staff increased day by day, and the number of sick horses also increased. The taste of crossing the Lujiang River in May can be imagined.</p>
<p>Although Liang's task this time was to survey the boundary, when he passed through Simao and Ning'er, he saw the people suffering from the epidemic, the school-age children with yellow faces and thin bones, and the continuous fields, which were desolate. Compared with entering the city, nine out of ten houses could be imagined to have suffered from the death of people in recent years. It was heard that since the epidemic began to spread, it had been fifteen or sixteen years, and the population of the area had been reduced by nearly eight-tenths. It was unavoidable to feel sad, and it was further confirmed by the observations along the way. There was not a drop of clear spring water for drinking, and not a clean piece of land for lodging. Mosquitoes and ropes intertwined, and humans and animals lived together. It was no wonder that epidemics were prevalent. Therefore, along the way, Liang told all sectors that hygiene was the way to save the weak and survive, and that it was an important government policy for border affairs. Liang also said that Yunnan had sufficient resources, but the national economy had not been fully developed because, firstly, the disease directly weakened the people's productivity, and secondly, the disease indirectly deterred the people's ambition to develop. Whenever he talked about the border areas, he used "miasma" to describe the fear, which made the great rivers and mountains abandoned to the ground. Therefore, the revitalization of the province should start with a health campaign.</p>
<p>On May 26th, at the invitation of the provincial party headquarters, he attended the memorial week to give a report. When Liang and Zhang finished reporting on the boundary affairs, they lamented the tragic situation in the epidemic area and the points that should be improved, which moved the listeners greatly.</p>
<p>On May 29th, the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association specially welcomed Commissioners Liang and Zhang and the fellow villagers of the boundary survey team. They specially invited Commissioners Liang and Zhang and Secretary Chen Shufeng to give speeches. Mr. Liang briefly told the fellow villagers about the hard work and endurance of the villagers along the way and their pioneering spirit. Then, Commissioner Zhang gave a speech saying that the spirit of adventure and enterprise of the Cantonese people should be maintained, and that they should work hand in hand with the merchants and travelers in Yunnan and the local natives to engage in development.</p>
<p>In recent days, Liang and Zhang have reported to Chairman Neng on the boundary and border affairs, and have also visited the heads of various departments and committees of the provincial party headquarters. Chairman Long and the heads of various departments and committees, as well as well-known figures in Yunnan, held a banquet for Liang and Zhang to thank them for their efforts in the boundary affairs and their painstaking planning for the past two years.

<h3>Soviet Union Develops Vegetable Oil</h3>
<p>[Moscow] The area sown with sunflowers this year is about 3 million hectares. This spring was particularly suitable for sowing, so it was completed early. The soil was also well fertilized, and the abundant rainfall in April and May made the sunflower seeds develop rapidly, so this year has a promising future for a bumper harvest. The selection of seeds is also very important. Soviet selectors have cultivated many types of sunflower seeds that can resist disease and disaster. This year, 1.2 million hectares of land will be planted with this new species. In addition, the area planted with soybeans, castor beans, peanuts, sesame seeds, and other oil-bearing plants has also been expanded this year. The soybean project will sow about 200,000 hectares, almost doubling from last year. The mechanization of cultivation and harvesting of oil-bearing plants has also made great progress. This year, the machine tractor stations serving collective farms will add 4,250 new special tractors and 73,000 cultivators specially designed for cultivating oil-bearing plants. Last year, there were only 900 special tractors and 12,000 cultivators. More than 90% of this year's sunflowers will be harvested by combine harvesters. (TASS News Agency)</p>

<h3>Shandong Traitor Qu Yunhong Jointly Operates Gold Mine with Japanese</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry has cancelled its registration. The Japanese are demanding compensation for losses.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Last year, a traitor named Qu Yunhong colluded with the Japanese to mine the Linglongshan Gold Mine in Zhaoyuan County. He submitted a report to the Qingdao Social Affairs Bureau, which was then forwarded to the Ministry of Industry for filing. The Ministry of Industry's Mining Department and the Qingdao Social Affairs Bureau did not investigate and approved it. For a time, the Japanese were arrogant and planned to open the mine on a large scale, and seemed to have some kind of attempt. Local public opinion was in an uproar. After research by the provincial government, the Qingdao municipal government, and the Ministry of Industry, a way to remedy the situation was found. Now the Ministry of Industry has cancelled its registration. However, the Japanese are unwilling to give up, claiming to have lost 700,000 to 800,000 yuan and are still demanding compensation. The matter has been going on for more than a year, and because it is of great importance, it has not been published. Now that it has been resolved, the process is supplemented as follows:</p>
<p>The History of the Mine</p>
<p>The Linglongshan Gold Mine in Zhaoyuan County was opened by Li Zongdai, a Cantonese official in Shandong, at the end of the Qing Dynasty. The ore quality was very good. Using old-fashioned methods, it could produce 100 taels of gold per day. All the places that were easy to mine had been mined. After Li's death, his successors were not good at management and the mine was stranded. Several years ago, a person named Qu Yunhong jointly operated the mine with the Japanese, but suffered heavy losses. Last spring, Qu contacted the Japanese again and raised a large amount of capital, reaching 1.4 million yuan in total (750,000 yuan from the Chinese and 650,000 yuan from the Japanese). Fearing that the provincial government would not approve, the company was moved from Jinan to Qingdao. The Qingdao Municipal Social Affairs Bureau forwarded the report to the Ministry of Industry for filing. It took only three months from the submission of the report to the approval, which was the fastest approval of a mine application in the past few years. Therefore, there were various rumors outside about the Qingdao Social Affairs Bureau and the Ministry of Industry's Mining Department. After hearing the news, the provincial government sent a telegram to the Ministry of Industry stating that it had not received the notice from the Qingdao Municipal Government. It was decided that such facts could not happen again, but the interests had been lost and it was too late to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Japanese Attempts</p>
<p>Although the mine company was nominally a Sino-Japanese joint venture, Qu Yunhong was only a puppet, and the power fell into the hands of the Japanese (the South Manchuria Railway listed the mine as one of its assets). It was found that the mine not only had a rich gold content, but also that Zhaoyuan was only 60 li away from the Longkou seaport. If it were operated by foreigners, it was feared that the mine would be used as a base, and the future worries were unimaginable. Moreover, after the so-called Sino-Japanese joint venture last year, the Japanese actively prepared everything, planning to build three plants for ore dressing, power generation, and smelting, purchased hundreds of acres of land, and installed telephones and paved light roads from Longkou to the mine. A piece of machinery had already been shipped to Longkou, and the Longkou office also had offices and staff dormitories. Large amounts of explosives were purchased, and a certain foreign warship that used electric drills to explore arrived in Longkou. Military officers took cars to the Linglongshan mine to inspect the terrain, with unfathomable intentions. Local people hated the Qingdao Social Affairs Bureau and the Ministry of Industry's Mining Department for being insane.</p>
<p>Cancellation of Registration</p>
<p>This spring, the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang was held. Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie went to Beijing. Shandong people traveling in Beijing repeatedly visited Shen to inquire about the mine situation. Shen then telegraphed Qingdao to transfer the entire case file to Beijing, and also visited Wu Dingchang, the Minister of Industry, to discuss remedial measures. Shandong people traveling in Beijing also contacted Zhang Yiou, the Director of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry, to question the matter. As a result of the talks, it was proven that most of the responsibility lay with the Mining Department and the Qingdao Social Affairs Bureau, but it was decided not to pursue the matter for the time being. It was decided that the government and local people would work together to study remedial measures. Afterwards, the Ministry of Industry actively conducted investigations. As a result, the names of the shareholders listed by the company were found to be non-existent at the listed addresses, and all were impersonations. Therefore, the company's registration was cancelled. However, the Japanese said that they had invested 700,000 to 800,000 yuan and demanded compensation for losses. The outcome is still unknown. Chu Zhen, the director of the Qingdao Social Affairs Bureau who handled the matter, has been dismissed from his post. It has not yet been heard whether the Director of the Mining Department of the Ministry of Industry has been punished.</p>
<h3>Price Issues After the Reform of the Monetary System in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Prices of goods transported from other provinces to Guangdong have slightly decreased. Huang Yuanbin published opinions on the reform.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the exchange rate between Guangdong currency and national currency was revised to 1.44, in order to comply with the law, the banks have been calculating all sales, payments, deliveries, and remittances at the rate of 1.44 since the 21st of this month, and the receiving party shall not refuse to accept it. The Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, as well as the provincial bank, have all posted the words "Exchange for National Currency" in front of the counter. In recent days, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have recovered about 1 million yuan of Guangdong currency. The provincial bank redeemed 700,000 to 800,000 yuan on the 21st and 1 million yuan on the 22nd. As for the market price of buying and selling in various silver shops, the exchange rate of provincial currency is about 1.439 due to the need for handling fees. The exchange rate between Hong Kong currency and provincial currency is 1.47 and there have been no major fluctuations in recent days.</p>
<p>Since Guangdong Province has changed its currency system to use the silver dollar, it will be implemented on New Year's Day next year. In the second half of this year, provincial currency will still be used at the statutory exchange rate, and Guangdong currency will be gradually recovered and destroyed with national currency. However, there are two major issues that are most worthy of consideration after changing to use the silver dollar: one is the change in the fiscal budget. According to estimates by the financial authorities, after Guangdong Province changes to use the silver dollar (that is, national currency), the provincial tax revenue will be reduced by about 1 to 2 million yuan per year. How to raise funds to offset this needs to be studied. Since tax revenue has decreased, the salaries of civil servants and educators should be paid in silver dollars. The expenditure of the treasury will naturally increase. If silver dollars are issued according to the original salary amount and discounted (it is said that it will be paid at 70%), it is not a good solution. Therefore, the expenditure in the annual budget will increase sharply in the future. The method of offsetting this should be to open up new tax sources or to obtain subsidies from the central government. As for the price issue after changing to use national currency, it is particularly important because it relates to the welfare of the people of Guangdong. In recent years, rural areas in Guangdong have gone bankrupt, remittances from overseas Chinese have decreased, and commerce has declined. The number of unemployed people is countless. After the change to the silver dollar system, the wages of laborers will be paid in silver dollars. The face value of the provincial currency converted into silver dollars will be less than the usual income in provincial currency. If prices do not fall to a level, the livelihood of the middle and lower classes of laborers will be even more difficult than before. The income is reduced, but the expenditure is still equal to the normal. In other words, if prices do not fall, the first to suffer from the change to the silver dollar will be the laboring and working class society. According to the current observation, after the reduction rate of the national currency and the Guangdong currency to 1.44, the only items whose prices have decreased are rice, soybean oil, cotton yarn, and flour imported from other provinces, because the exchange rate has slightly decreased and the goods from other provinces have slightly decreased accordingly. There is an exact number that can be calculated and unscrupulous merchants cannot hide. As for the products produced within the province and purchased with silver dollars, it is not easy to raise the price to a certain level, because there is no silver dollar price as a standard. Unscrupulous merchants will inevitably manipulate them and make excuses to maintain the original price. What method will the government use to improve the situation? This is really a big problem. Inland products account for a large part of the daily necessities of Guangdong people. If this is not resolved, the laboring and working class will suffer from the reduction in income and will not enjoy the reduction in general prices. The painful situation of this deformed life is inevitable. Therefore, this point is a matter that the authorities should pay close attention to after changing to use the silver dollar.</p>
<p>In addition, Huang Yuanbin, the director of the Department of Economics of Zhongshan University, expressed his opinions on the currency reform in Guangdong Province, and the conclusion is as follows: "However, the matter of intercepting and recovering Guangdong banknotes starting from January 1st next year is when the world economy is improving, so it can be reluctantly implemented, and it should also be implemented with a gradual method. Before the people of Guangdong have a solid understanding of the exchange rate, a large part of the Guangdong currency should still be retained as auxiliary currency. If it is a little rushed, there will be the following disadvantages (see below). The first point is that the finances cannot be supported. In any case, it will ultimately be no more than central subsidies and increased tax revenue. However, the amount is too large, so it is difficult to have this certainty. This is the most important thing to consider. The disadvantages of being a little rushed are as follows: ㊀ It is difficult for workers and farmers (including machine workers, handicraft workers, and workers in agriculture, mining, silkworm silk, etc.) to cut back according to the exchange rate, the production cost of various products increases, production will inevitably be hit, and rural construction will have to be delayed. ㊁ Civil servants throughout the province and teachers and staff of national, provincial, municipal, and private schools will inevitably request that the national currency be issued in accordance with their official ranks, in order to unify the national official salary, and should not be discriminated against as an excuse, and it will be difficult for the finances to cope with it. If the official salary cannot be unified, but only the currency is unified first, it is difficult for the government to make a statement. This time, the tax revenue has also been slightly reduced due to the reduction in the exchange rate. How can this huge amount of expenditure be increased under the fiscal deficit? Therefore, the rush method is difficult to implement. From the financial point of view, it should be after the financial reorganization is effective. ㊂ About eight or nine tenths of the Guangdong copper coins in circulation are issued after purchasing silver, which are still new coins. If they are recovered immediately, about 6 to 7 million yuan of printing costs will be wasted."</p>
<h3>Mountain Floods in the Fujian-Jiangxi Border Washed Away the Dongjiang and Hanjiang Rivers</h3>
<p>The dikes in various places collapsed and the coastline suffered considerable losses.</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Chaozhou, Meizhou, and Dongjiang counties have been suffering from a severe drought this spring. It was not until ten days before the Dragon Boat Festival that they received timely rain. Most of the rice in the highlands had already turned yellow. Although there was a little rain, there was no hope of a good harvest. The water level on the rivers on the banks of the rivers in various places on the Dragon Boat Festival, but after that, it rained continuously. The water of the Dongjiang and Hanjiang rivers was gathered by mountain floods in Fujian and Jiangxi, and rose sharply by more than a foot. Within ten days, it rose and fell three times. On the 13th, the mountain water on the Fujian border washed towards Jiaoling County. The water flew down from the mountains, like ten thousand horses galloping, and washed straight to Liuxi, Fengling, and Dakengtou in the Baitou District of Meixian County. All the houses, fields, and objects in the low-lying areas were washed away. Within 60 li, it was covered with mud and sand, forming a muddy road. More than ten feet of the river embankment in the section below the building in Liuxi Township and the section of the dam below the mountain collapsed. Many bridges were washed away. Cars on the Meisong Highway stopped traffic. Although the early rice had been harvested, the autumn harvest was hopeless. On the 16th, mountain floods on the Fujian border washed in again, and the upper reaches of the Hanjiang River rose again. Dabu County, which is the confluence of the Tingjiang and Meihe rivers, suddenly rose by more than one foot, setting a new record in the past fifty years. The towns along the coast of Dabu City, Sanhe Dam, Gaobei, and Liuhuang were flooded by eight or nine feet. The water in the low-lying areas was more than one foot deep. Many power poles were broken and the losses to bridges and highways could not be counted at this time. The water flow was so fast that electric boats could not sail upstream, so it was extremely difficult to understand the situation upstream. When the water rose, the heavy rain did not stop. The East Gate, Upper and Lower Water Gates, and Bamboo and Wood Gates of Chaoan City all dropped water fences. The river water came ashore and poured into the city from the Water Gate in the city. The water in the streets and alleys was a foot deep. The protective embankment highway and the earthen dikes in Longwei Village and Yuepu Village were mostly destroyed. The Seventh and Eighth District Township Directors supervised the strong men to rescue and transport sand and stones to the dikes. Kerosene lamps were lit at night, shining like daylight. The Nandou culvert at the entrance of the Sanli Creek was washed into the river by the river water on the 19th morning, and poured straight into Jieyang. Thirty houses there were washed down by the water. The people of the whole village rescued and filled them in before they were able to do nothing. On the 20th, the sky cleared, and on the 21st, the water receded into the river. The farmers hurriedly cut rafts to harvest the early rice, hoping to harvest 30% to 50%. On the 24th, it rose again, because the mountain water on the Fujian border was released again, and the water flooded outside the East Gate of Chaoan. At this time, the highways and bridges in various places were damaged, traffic was blocked, and news was not reliable. The situation on the Dongjiang River was also the same. Xingning, Zijin, and Wuhua are located in the mountains, which are the boundary between the Dongjiang and Hanjiang rivers. Half of the water from these two counties comes out of the Dongjiang River, and half comes out of the Hanjiang River. Half of the water in southern Jiangxi flows into the Ganjiang River, and half flows into the Northeast and Hanjiang rivers. Usually, if there is heavy rain on the Fujian border, the Hanjiang River will rise. If there is heavy rain on the Jiangxi border, the Dongjiang River will rise. The water of the Dongjiang River rose on the 13th, fell on the 17th, and rose again by more than a foot on the 19th. It began to recede on the 22nd, and rose again on the 24th. The situation was the same as that of the Hanjiang River. The cities of Longchuan, Heyuan, Huiyang, and Boluo were flooded. The water was one or two feet above the ground. 30% of the early rice that had not been harvested was flooded. The farmers had to harvest it in the flood. Therefore, this time, the mountain floods in Fujian and Jiangxi washed the two rivers, and dozens of counties along the river suffered huge losses. The Guangshan Highway, which was originally scheduled to open on the 21st, has now been postponed. (25th)</p>
<h3>Stone Age Relics Found in Wuping</h3>
<p>There are many types and large quantities.</p>
<p>Wuping Correspondence: Stone Age relics have always been found in the Yellow River basin. Although a few have been found south of the Yellow River, such as Gutang in West Lake, Hangzhou, and Shaoxing and Huzhou, there are not many types and the quantities are small. Recently, many types and large quantities of Stone Age relics have been found in Wuping, Fujian. The area of the ruins is unprecedented south of the Yellow River. The discovery process is described as follows:</p>
<p>At 3:00 pm on April 26th this year, Liang Huipu, the director of education of Wuping Middle School, led more than ten students from the school, including Xiu Guohong, on a hike to the Xiaojingbei Mountain outside Nandou. Suddenly, a piece of wavy pottery was picked up on the mountain. Liang immediately suspected that there were antiquities buried there, so he searched around and picked up a fragment of a stone arrowhead. Later, he picked up a stone ax and dozens of pieces of pottery. He returned to school at dusk. Liang has a great interest in the study of history. Since discovering this kind of relic, he has been taking several students or hoeing alone to explore the mountains in the vicinity during his spare time. As of the 10th of this month, it was heard that he had discovered a large number of fossil stone chisels, stone axes, stone arrowheads, stone rings, stone knives, pebbles, grindstones, stone pestles, and pottery with wavy patterns, mat patterns, seat patterns, swastika patterns, cross patterns, and geometric patterns. The texture of the pottery includes black pottery and gray pottery. One of them is engraved with ancient characters.</p>

<p>Police Bureau Captures Opium Addict</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 26th, Li Xu, a specially appointed clerk from the Jinshan County Government, came to Songjiang to report to the district headquarters, stating that Chen Tongfu, a resident of Sanjiaodu outside the west gate of the county, was involved in privately smoking and selling opium. The district headquarters immediately ordered the county police bureau to, together with Li Xu and the Yue Miao town chief and Baozhang, lead police to search his residence. They found seventy packets of opium and many smoking paraphernalia in his room. However, Chen was in the hospital undergoing opium detoxification. They immediately dispatched personnel to the hospital to inquire. They learned that Chen was having dinner at the home of his sister, surnamed Xu, at No. 8 Fengliu Village. They went to the address, but Chen had not yet returned. However, a smoking pipe was found on the bed of the hostess, Xu Chen Shi. The woman was also suspected of private smoking, so they took her and the smoking pipe back to the hospital. Chen had just returned to the hospital and was arrested and taken to the police bureau, then transferred to the district headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<p>Jailed Farmers Stage Hunger Strike</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the court detention center, more than sixty inmates suddenly announced a hunger strike during breakfast. After investigation by the warden, it was learned that most of the hunger strikers were tenants detained by the county government last winter. Among them were three female tenants, with only a few remand prisoners joining in solidarity. Subsequently, the warden entered to persuade them to eat and promised to approach the county government to find a way to mediate.</p>
<p>Car Accident Caused by Foreigner</p>
<p>At the 44th bridge on the Xihu Road in the county, yesterday around 6 pm, a car driven by a German was returning from Changshu to Shanghai when it hit Chen Mingde, a person from Anhui, who was walking on the road. Chen's legs were broken by the wheels. The car, realizing that it had caused an accident, sped eastward and fled. After the incident, someone telegraphed Taicang, and the car was intercepted there. The injured person has been taken to the hospital. The car that caused the accident has been returned to Changshu and handed over to the police bureau.</p>

<p>Stopping the Export of Dried Cocoons</p>
<p>To stop unscrupulous merchants from exporting dried cocoons, the central government has telegraphed the relevant authorities to investigate and handle the matter strictly. The Jiangsu Sericulture Improvement Association has also, together with the Jiangsu Cocoon Industry Association, investigated the truth and formulated measures to prohibit it, and submitted them to the province for approval. However, in recent days, a large number of dried cocoons have been exported, reportedly to France for the production of military supplies. A French merchant bank in Shanghai has entrusted a trust bureau to handle the exchange settlement. It is estimated that more than 10,000 dan of raw cocoons have been shipped so far, and the price of cocoons has risen from 165 yuan to 190 yuan. It is said that the French merchant needs to purchase another 20,000 dan of dried cocoons. However, the total amount of cocoons produced in Wuxi this year is only 45,000 dan, leaving only 60%. Considering the 40 silk factories in the county with 12,000 silk reeling machines, the remaining 25,000 dan of raw materials are only enough to supply one month. Therefore, all the silk factories are greatly alarmed. The silk factory industry association convened a temporary emergency meeting yesterday to discuss the matter in detail and has developed strict and effective measures to report to the central and provincial governments for implementation.</p>
<p>More Disturbances at Lixin Factory</p>
<p>A labor strike occurred at Lixin Textile Printing and Dyeing Company on the 6th of this month. After the commissioner's office, together with various party and government departments, earnestly mediated, the factory improved its treatment of workers according to the county government's handling plan, and the strike was completely settled. However, when the night shift workers were about to start work the night before last, a group of female workers, about 200, did not show up at the factory. When work started yesterday, some rogue-like elements blocked the female workers from going to work, attempting to incite a labor strike. The factory immediately reported to the county police bureau, which dispatched police security teams and patrol teams to suppress the situation. Fortunately, the female workers were all very sensible and were not swayed by them. They have already returned to work as usual.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Secret Hair Perming</p>
<p>Electrical hair perming in this county has long been strictly prohibited by the authorities. However, the Chongan Temple Beauty Salon in the city still secretly set up a private room to privately perm women's hair. The county police bureau dispatched a security police team to search the shop at 5 pm on the 27th. In the kitchen behind the shop hall, there was a small room with a secret room inside. The room contained hair perming electrical appliances and rubber clips, etc. Three women were seen, one of whom, Shen Yueqin, was having her hair permed. The person sitting next to her was a companion. Another woman, Chen Renxian, was a female receptionist employed by the shop. The barbers Xu Er and Xu Zhixiang were also taken to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Provincial Government Corrects Opium Prohibition</p>
<p>Recently, reports in Wuxi and Wujin counties stated that opium shops in various counties had received orders from Zheng Taozhi, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Office of the Opium Prohibition Supervision Office, to provide relief to unlicensed opium smokers and to conduct a general registration. These opium smokers could also obtain ordinary and poor people's opium licenses, and a deadline would be set after a certain period. After reading this information, the Jiangsu Provincial Government considered that the Jiangsu Province's four-year opium prohibition plan was announced before the central government's six-year plan. This measure only applied to the Shanghai Special Municipality. Most of the opium smokers in Jiangsu Province had been cleared, and there was no need for a general registration of opium smokers. The government ordered a correction to maintain the prohibition policy.</p>
<p>Forgery of Grain Vouchers Results in Imprisonment</p>
<p>Xu Shuyun, a field tax distribution clerk in Lujiaqiao, forged grain vouchers to defraud 303.20 yuan in legal tender. The owner, Wei Zuling, reported this to the Party headquarters. The county summoned the victim witnesses Yuan Fugen and Gu Zhongying for questioning. On the afternoon of the 26th, Xu Shuyun was sentenced to four years of imprisonment and four years of deprivation of civil rights for forging documents and defrauding money.</p>

<p>Robbery in Xingren Town</p>
<p>Zhu Fayuan's home in Xingren Town, 15 miles east of the city, was suddenly robbed. After investigation by the police bureau's detective team, the criminals Wen Shirong, Cao Liancheng, and Zhang Guohua were arrested and sent to the Fourth District Security Command for interrogation by the military judge Chu.</p>

<p>Surveying Water Conditions in the Plum Rain</p>
<p>The county has been experiencing continuous plum rains, and the water level has risen sharply. The farmland in the four townships has become a swamp. Fortunately, all the Sanjiang sluice gates are open, and the water is draining smoothly. If the weather clears for a few days, there should be no concern. To understand the actual situation in the four townships and whether the Hangzhou-Cao'e section of the railway bridge project is obstructing drainage, the county government sent Zhao Jiayu and Lou Zhifan to Gaobu, Dongguan, Cao'e, and other places on the afternoon of the 26th for inspection. The results showed that the bridges were draining smoothly and did not obstruct farmland irrigation. They returned to the city in the evening.</p>

<p>Police Team Comes to Wenling to Station</p>
<p>The First and Second Squadrons of the 11th Brigade of the Security Team have been ordered to reorganize into the Wenling County Security Police Team. The two squadrons have already arrived in the county. It is learned that the county government has ordered the First Squadron to be stationed at the county government and the Second Squadron to be stationed at Zheheng. Both squadrons departed on the 22nd to distribute defensive duties.</p>

<p>Escalating Electricity Dispute</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 25th, various businesses held an emergency meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce regarding the Yaoyuan electricity problem to discuss countermeasures. It was decided: (1) to send a public telegram to the Nanjing Central Construction Electricity Association and the Anqing Construction Department, requesting strict sanctions to appease public sentiment; (2) to organize a preparatory committee to discuss improvements in electricity supply and solicit opinions to address the situation. The telegram to the Construction Committee and the Construction Department was sent that evening. Furthermore, the preparatory committee to discuss improvements in electricity supply in Hefei will convene a meeting of various sectors of society and shareholders of the company at the Chamber of Commerce at 3 pm on the 26th to discuss improvement methods. The situation is escalating.</p>

<h3>Civil Administration in Yunnan</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>In the past, Yunnan's civil administration had few remarkable achievements. The current heads of the provincial government departments, for the sake of overall planning, drafted a "Three-Year Governance Plan," requesting the provincial government to announce its implementation and assess the results with strict rewards and punishments. As a result, the province's civil administration has gradually improved.</p>
<p>The organization of county defense corps in Yunnan originally followed the regulations issued by the ministry in the 23rd year of the Republic, but the authorities modified and supplemented them slightly in consideration of local conditions. The "defense corps" referred to by the police and communication offices includes the Baojia system, defense teams, and regular troops. (1) The Baojia system is the basic part of operating the defense corps. Enrollment in this system is not based on labor force but on the number of households. That is, the population of each household, regardless of age, must be incorporated into the Baojia organization. In addition, there is a "meeting group method," which is also different from the ministry's "exercise method." The meeting group method requires each district, township, Jia, and Pai with 300 to 500 households to hold a meeting group once a month, those with 500 to 1,000 households to hold a meeting group once every two months, and those with 1,000 to 5,000 households to hold a meeting group once every six months. During the meeting group, at least one person from each household must attend and bring a weapon, regardless of whether it is a knife, spear, gun, or other weapon. At the time, no exercises are performed. The district, township, Jia, and Pai chiefs only propagate recent current affairs and important government decrees and news. If there are local disputes, they are also resolved impartially. (2) The defense team is a further organization of the Baojia, which draws able-bodied men aged 20 to 40 from the compiled Baojia to form defense teams. During slack farming seasons, they are summoned for training and given military skills and party and government knowledge. Their task is to protect the local area and suppress scattered bandits, with the principle of not leaving the county. However, in the event of an emergency, when the regular team is insufficient to be dispatched, they have the obligation to be conscripted and provide reinforcements. At ordinary times, those with strong physique and courage are specially formed into "arrest" and "blockade" teams, while the rest are defense teams. Each year, the chief commander (兼縣長) conducts two or three emergency assemblies. (3) The regular team is a type of organization in Yunnan that adopts an obligatory militia system. All men aged 20 to 24 have the obligation to be incorporated into the regular team for training and service. Conscription is done by drawing lots. The term of service is six months. Upon discharge, they are issued certificates by the Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government and are incorporated into the original Baojia as reserve soldiers. As for the establishment, training, appointment of officers, and distribution of military supplies and equipment of the regular teams in each county, they are handled by the "Group Affairs Supervision and Training Office" under the orders of the Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government. Under the Group Affairs Supervision and Training Office, the province is divided into ten districts, each with a supervision and training sub-office to assist in handling matters. The number of regular team members trained and discharged in each county has reached five or six terms, totaling more than 40,000 people. In the future, this will be gradually promoted to ensure that all able-bodied men in the province receive training. In addition, city walls have been repaired and more than 5,000 blockhouses have been built. Yunnan currently has one city, one hundred and twelve counties (in the 22nd year of the Republic, the Department of Civil Affairs determined the ranking of each county based on surveys and statistics of the area, population, and wealth of each county, with 25 first-class counties, 27 second-class counties, and 60 third-class counties), 14 establishment bureaus, one establishment affairs commissioner, and two tax relief supervisors, totaling 130 administrative units directly under the provincial department. In addition, there are ten county assistants and eleven tax relief officials directly under the jurisdiction of the respective county governments and tax relief supervisor offices. The total population of the province, excluding Changning and Yanshan counties and Ninglang, Lianghe, and Cang County three establishment bureaus, for which there are no survey figures, is 11,750,462. The area is approximately 1,201,000 square li, with an average of approximately eleven people per square li.</p>
<p>The administration of the county, regardless of civil, financial, construction, or educational affairs, must be handled jointly by the county government. It is truly a broad scope and heavy responsibility. Going further, with 130 such administrative units under the jurisdiction of the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, it is naturally inevitable to feel that the reach is too long and it is difficult to take care of everything. However, why does Yunnan not establish surveillance commissioners? According to Ding Zhaoguan, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, one reason is the difficulty in funding. Setting up more agencies would require more funding. The second reason is that the area is too vast and transportation is inconvenient. Adding another level of administration would reduce efficiency. For example, Xinping County in the Puer area is only four stations away from the provincial domain. If a commissioner were established in Simao, the county's official documents would have to go to the Simao commissioner's office first, which is 14 stations, then to the provincial department, which is another 17 stations, and then back down from the provincial department, which is another 31 stations, for a total round trip time of more than 60 days. Not only would administrative efficiency be reduced, but "Tonghai soy sauce" would also become "Lufeng vinegar" (there is a saying: "Tonghai soy sauce, Hexi cloth, Yuxi girls, Lufeng vinegar," meaning that the products of each county are very good).</p>
<p>In order to promote and reform county administration, the Department of Civil Affairs established a term of county magistrate training last year, with 91 trainees. A batch of graduates was assigned to various counties to take office in the early spring of this year.</p>
<p>The treatment of administrative officials in various counties of Yunnan, on the surface, is clearly a business of losing money. Since the fourth year of the Republic, the monthly salary of county magistrates has been uniformly 100 silver dollars, but the public funds are different, with 450 yuan for first-class counties and 100 yuan less for second and third-class counties. There are also some extra informal fees as subsidies, which can be said to be the golden age of county magistrates. Later, from the tenth to the twenty-third year of the Republic, due to financial difficulties, the situation deteriorated year by year. People in the salary class were all affected. The county magistrate's monthly salary and public funds combined were only 1,200 old Yunnan bills (equivalent to 120 national currency) for first-class counties, 1,000 yuan for second-class counties, and 800 yuan for third-class counties. Moreover, the salaries of all section chiefs, section members, jailers, and the costs of stationery, paper, tea, and water were all included. With a sum equivalent to about 100 yuan of national currency, it was naturally extremely difficult to manage the expenses of a county government. However, since the 24th year, with gradual improvement in finances, the salary and public funds have already doubled.</p>

<h3>An Overview of the 11th Joint Microbiology Society of Japan</h3>
<p>— Wang Meixian (Sent from Tokyo)</p>
<p>The 11th Joint Microbiology Society of Japan was held at the Department of Bacteriology, Niigata Medical University, for three days on April 7, 8, and 9. Papers were presented, problems were discussed, and special lectures were given. The event was a grand occasion. I participated with colleagues from the Department of Bacteriology, Keio University School of Medicine, and I was quite impressed. Therefore, despite my ignorance, I will briefly describe the grand occasion of the conference to share with domestic enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The Joint Microbiology Society of Japan has been established for eleven years, with the aim of engaging in the research of microbiology. A general meeting is held once a year, and the venue and president are rotated each year. Last year, it was held at the Department of Bacteriology, Keio University in Tokyo, with Dr. Sosaburo as the president. This year's president was Professor Miyaji of Niigata Medical University. The president appointed six to ten secretaries in advance to prepare for all matters related to the conference. The society is an academic society that aims to study microbiology. It is composed of medical schools and other research institutions. To date, 37 organizations have joined. Their names are listed below:</p>
<p>Department of Mycology, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Imperial University</p>
<p>Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto Imperial University</p>
<p>Department of Bacteriology, Faculty of Medicine, Osaka Imperial University</p>
<p>Department of Bacteriology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu Imperial University</p>
<p>Department of Bacteriology, Faculty of Medicine, Tohoku Imperial University</p>
<p>Department of Bacteriology, Faculty of Medicine, Hokkaido Imperial University</p>
<p>Department of Bacteriology, Faculty of Medicine, Keio University</p>
<p>Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Keijo Imperial University</p>
<p>Department of Bacteriology, Faculty of Medicine, Taihoku Imperial University</p>
<p>Department of Bacteriology, Nagasaki Medical University</p>
<p>Department of Microbiology, Kumamoto Medical University</p>
<p>Department of Bacteriology, Okayama Medical University</p>
<p>Department of Bacteriology, Kanazawa Medical University</p>
<p>Department of Bacteriology, Niigata Medical University</p>
<p>Department of Bacteriology, Chiba Medical University</p>
<p>Department of Bacteriology, Nagoya Medical University</p>
<p>Department of Microbiology, Kyoto Prefectural Medical University</p>

<p>Department of Bacteriology, Nippon Medical School</p>
<p>Department of Microbiology, Manshu Medical University</p>
<p>Department of Preventive Medicine, Army Medical School</p>
<p>Department of Preventive Medicine, Naval Medical School</p>
<p>Institute for Infectious Diseases, Tokyo Imperial University</p>
<p>Kitasato Institute</p>
<p>Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka Imperial University</p>
<p>Ishigami Institute</p>
<p>Manchuria Railway Health Institute</p>
<p>Central Research Institute, Taiwan Governor-General's Office</p>
<p>Shanghai Institute of Natural Sciences</p>
<p>Department of Microbiology and Bacteriology, Daegu Medical College</p>
<p>Department of Bacteriology, Tokyo Women's Medical College</p>
<p>Tokyo Higher Dental School</p>
<p>Department of Dental Microbiology, Nippon University School of Dentistry</p>
<p>Microbiology Society of Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo Microscopical Society</p>
<p>The society's expenses are borne by the constituent organizations, with each organization paying an annual membership fee of 20 yuan. The Kitasato Institute and the Institute for Infectious Diseases each pay for five units, and the Osaka Imperial University Institute for Microbial Diseases pays for two units. However, those engaged in microbiology research who wish to present papers at the conference can also directly join as temporary members with the recommendation of a councilor, paying five yuan for each presentation. For presentations from member organizations, each unit may not exceed three presentations to show limitation.</p>
<p>There were as many as 128 presentations at this conference. Although the conference was held for three days, starting at 8 am and ending at 5 pm each day, it still felt very short. Therefore, each presentation was limited to only seven minutes. A signal was installed on the stage. A green light indicated the start, a yellow light indicated five minutes, and a red light indicated seven minutes, at which point the speaker had to step down. However, questions and additions could extend the time by two minutes. With such limitations, the speakers had to alternate rapidly each day, so each presentation had to be extremely concise, and many tables could only be glanced at. A councilor was invited to each presentation. These were mostly professors from various medical universities or directors of research institutes. After each presentation, the councilor would stand up to ask if there were any questions or additions. If not, the next presentation would continue. If there were, the questions could be raised, and if one had similar research or insights, they could also be added. The speakers handed over their forms to the staff in advance, who helped with the arrangements. If slides or films were needed during the presentation, it had to be stated in advance. After the presentation was completed, the manuscript had to be submitted to the recorder in the audience. If there were any questions or additions, the recording staff would immediately send paper and pen to request that the original intention be rewritten and submitted for supplementary printing in future edited publications.</p>
<p>The order of presentations was arranged with similar topics grouped together. Due to the large number of presentations, it is difficult to write about everything. Therefore, I will write down a few important points below.</p>
<p>(1) Since Felix Pitt and others discovered in recent years that whether typhoid bacteria contain vi antigens is closely related to virulence, colony characteristics, agglutination reactions, and Rakteijsphage, countries have successively studied this exhaustively. There were also many presentations on this aspect at this conference in Japan.</p>
<p>(2) The presentations on the third day were all about filterable pathogens, especially the research presentations on the pathogens of epidemic encephalitis that occurred in Tokyo and other places years ago. In the past, research on epidemic encephalitis was done with monkeys as experiments. In recent years, Japan has been experimenting with white mice and has achieved considerable results. This time, at the 200th anniversary of the founding of the University of Göttingen in Germany, Professor Takeuchi of Tokyo Imperial University was invited to lecture on "Research and Distribution of Pathogens of Japanese Epidemic Encephalitis."</p>
<p>(3) The special lecture was by Professor Taniguchi of Osaka Medical University on "Recent Knowledge of the Study of Filterable Pathogens." This was his research over many years, explaining the nature, size, and microscopic methods of filterable pathogens in great detail. It lasted for three hours and was explained with a full range of tables, objects, and slides, which was very well received by the audience. (I will take the opportunity to introduce knowledge about filterable pathogens at another time.)</p>
<p>(4) Finally, it is worth mentioning the research on plague. The so-called Manchuria Railway Health Institute in Dalian has conducted in-depth research, with as many as 777 papers on this topic. Among them, Dr. Kuranouchi's anti-hyperimmunity to plague bacteria is said to be quite effective. Therefore, the Asakawa Paper Review Committee awarded him an honorary medal.</p>
<p>There are many medical associations in Japan, totaling about 50. Each department and field has an academic society to discuss and study various aspects of academics, in order to progress with each passing day. General meetings are held successively in various places every spring, full of vitality. The rapid progress of Japanese medicine, which is on par with European and American countries, cannot but be attributed to this. I hope that my colleagues in the medical field will catch up quickly.</p>
<h3>Reflections After Compiling Obstetrics and Gynecology Lecture Notes (Serialized in the Medical Journal)</h3>
<p>— Qu Shaoheng</p>
<p>Looking at the treatments for various gynecological diseases, apart from using ice packs for acute inflammation, the main principle is to maintain warmth and avoid cold. This is to protect the reproductive functions. However, modern men and women are ignorant of this principle, blindly following Western trends and indulging in modernity. Even in the severe winter with snow and ice, they still wear thin clothes and single trousers, silk stockings and sandals, swaying on the streets, considering slenderness as beauty and softness as goodness. They are going against nature and violating hygiene, resulting in the healthy becoming weak, the weak becoming ill, and the ill dying. This is because in the universe, the air is thinner above and thicker below. When it encounters heat, it expands and rises. When it rises, cold air comes to replenish it. Rising and falling, wind is thus produced. We sit and stand in the air, and although the whole body is stimulated by cold, the feet receive the most due to body position. For the sake of regulating body temperature, the skin, like sensory nerves, causes blood vessels to constrict to prevent heat loss when it feels cold. At the same time, it promotes metabolism and produces more heat to meet needs. Conversely, when it encounters heat, it causes blood vessels to dilate to release excess heat and relax metabolism to limit heat production. Therefore, even in the extremely cold winter and the extremely hot summer, the body temperature remains at 37 degrees Celsius. The skin's sensation is very sensitive. For example, in summer, when the red sun covers the sky, the outdoor air is above 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit). If one foot steps into an air-conditioned room, it feels like entering an ice cellar. When walking out of the room, it feels like being in a fire pit. The difference between cold and hot is more than 10 or 12 degrees Celsius. The regulatory function inevitably has inadequacies or incapacities. Even if it can be adjusted temporarily, it will inevitably be damaged in a day. Moreover, blood vessel constriction can prevent heat loss, but the nutrition of the parts it controls is also hindered. The occurrence of frostbite is the result of poor blood circulation. The nerve center of the foot is in the lumbar vertebrae (the lower part of the spine), and the center of the sexual organs (reproductive organs) is in the sacrum. Therefore, the cold received by the foot has a significant impact on the blood circulation and nutritional status of all sexual organs. Those who are developing suffer from incomplete development. Those who are in the childbearing period suffer from menstrual disorders and infertility. Those with existing diseases of the sexual organs suffer from prolonged recurrence. This is not only true for humans but also for plants and animals. Observe that in winter, the roots of flowers and trees in the garden are wrapped with straw or soil to prevent cold in the lower part. One day, the author went to the Shuyuan Chicken Farm in Minhang. When the sun was shining, he did not see a single chicken. He asked the owner, Zhu Hange, why he did not let the chickens out to roam. Zhu said that the ice had not melted, and the chickens' feet were cold, so they would catch a cold and lay fewer eggs, and he was afraid they would eat cold things. If one wants flowers and trees to flourish and eggs to increase, they should be protected like this. How can women who bear the mission of multiplying the race and whose duty is to produce not take extra care?</p>
<p>Recently, the author has seen an increasing number of young women seeking treatment for infertility and menstrual disorders. Although the reasons are diverse, the aforementioned modern dress is a major cause. (I have written a book called "Modern Cold Leg Disease"). Nowadays, young women often say they have lower back pain and leg pain and irregular menstruation. I ask, do elderly women who live to a ripe old age have this disease in their youth? What was their dress like in their youth? It is not that the climate is different from the past but that the clothing is different, causing women's physiques to be slender and weak and to become increasingly inferior. I am afraid that the harm will be even more unimaginable ten years later. If we want a healthy country and a strong race in this way, it is no different from heading south by driving the chariot north or climbing a tree to catch fish. Those in authority with a sense of national concept and those who advocate eugenics, how will they manage the aftermath?</p>
<h3>Sanitary Inspection Report of Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei and other Places (17)</h3>

<p>The hospital is located in the suburbs of Nanchang, with fresh air and a suitable environment. In addition to hospitalized patients with leprosy, there is also an outpatient clinic. It is said that patients are treated with injections, which are quite effective. However, leprosy is most easily transmitted, and outpatient treatment without isolation seems inappropriate.</p>

<h3>The Result of Thorough Investigation by the Ministry of the Yarn Exchange Storm</h3>
<p>Finding Illegal Facts, Administrative Sanctions are Given First. Wu Ruiyuan Retires, the Registration of Three Brokers is Revoked, and Nine Businesses are Fined 5,000 Yuan Each for the Punishment of Directors and Supervisors.</p>
<p>The Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry personally came to Shanghai for a thorough investigation of the storm in the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange. It has been several days. Because the Executive Yuan meeting was held in Beijing today, he returned to Beijing to attend it last night. A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit yesterday afternoon. He was received and informed of the handling process, and inspected the documents regarding the administrative sanctions. He also stated that after his departure from Shanghai, important officials would remain in Shanghai to continue the thorough investigation, and he could come in person if necessary. The details of the various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Minister Wu's Speech</p>
<p>A storm occurred at the Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange at the end of May during the settlement period. From June 8th to 9th, auctions and trading were suspended again, which was a serious matter. According to the thorough investigation by the Ministry, the chairman, Mu Xiangyue, stated in public that the storm was caused by rumors that the government had borrowed foreign debts, which would be used to repay domestic debts, reduce interest rates, and inflate the currency, causing prices to rise. In addition, there were only about 10,000 bales of yarn in Shanghai at the end of May, which was exploited by speculators. It is obvious that someone spread rumors or used tricks to attempt to check the accounts. However, there are too many records and it is not easy to verify them. If you want to be precise and thorough, it cannot be completed in three to five days. However, with the efforts of colleagues, many illegal facts have been found. Those that can be given administrative sanctions have been severely punished separately by the Ministry. Those involving criminal suspicion under Articles 49 and 52 of the Exchange Law should be severely punished by the competent authorities in accordance with the law. The Ministry will continue to work hard to check all accounts. If any are found, they will be dealt with strictly in accordance with the law. What I feel painfully is that the names of persons representing rights and obligations must be limited to one person and one name in law, and must not be recorded under the name of a business. Only in this way can China's economic organization be brought into line with standards, and the financial aspect can begin to implement progressive tax rates such as inheritance and income taxes, which will make checking accounts more convenient. However, due to the long-standing habits and the lack of legal restrictions, the colleagues checking the accounts are buried in the names of businesses and nicknames every day. It is quite difficult to trace the names of the relevant parties. Even if they are pointed out, it is still difficult to prove whether they are substitutes or fictitious. It will take time to inquire one by one to get the truth. Moreover, those who are good at planning will still have room for concealment and evasion even after detailed inquiries. As far as the current situation is concerned, since the law is not restricted, the cunning can easily take advantage of this to deceive. Ge Shengyi sighed.</p>
<p>Order to the Yarn Exchange Council</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry ordered the Yarn and Cloth Exchange Council, "After a thorough investigation by the Ministry into the storm that occurred at the Exchange, Council Member Wu Ruiyuan violated Articles 23, Paragraph 4 and 42 of the Exchange Law and should be dismissed from office first. Broker No. 15, Yu Da Firm, Broker No. 35, Shen Da Firm, and Broker No. 38, Hua Mao Firm, all violated Articles 13 and 42 of the Exchange Law and should be revoked their registration first. Broker No. 53, Da Chang Cheng Firm, violated Article 42 of the Exchange Law and should be temporarily suspended from business first. The Council is hereby ordered to comply with this order and to investigate and handle the matter in accordance with the law." It is reported that the above-mentioned brokers are mostly related to Wu Ruiyuan and Xu Maochang.</p>
<p>Order to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry instructed the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, "After investigating the storm that occurred at the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange, the Ministry found that nine firms, including Cheng Da, Yuan Da, Yi Da, Xin Da, Mei Da, Fu Ji Company, Yu Ji, Chuan Ji, and Hua Mao, all violated Article 16 of the Exchange Law. In accordance with the provisions of Article 47 of the same law, each is fined 5,000 yuan and should be prohibited from operating as an agent, introducer, or transmitter of exchange trading. The Bureau is hereby ordered to execute the order separately and to await investigation and handling in accordance with the law." It is reported that the nine businesses, including Cheng Da, are also mostly related to Wu Ruiyuan and Xu Maochang. Another order stated, "Article 16 of the Exchange Law stipulates that no one may operate as an agent, introducer, or transmitter of exchange trading. Recently, it has been heard that there are many businesses or individuals in Shanghai who violate the above provisions and illegally profit from them, which is a violation of the ban. The Bureau is hereby ordered to thoroughly investigate and instruct the councils of each exchange and each broker to report them at any time and punish them separately in accordance with the provisions of Article 47 of the Exchange Law and prohibit their business."</p>
<p>Reprimand and Discipline the Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry also ordered the Yarn Exchange Council, "During May and June, the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange repeatedly experienced storms of market manipulation. The Council failed to prevent them in advance and did not take appropriate measures in time, and did not report to the Ministry to send personnel for thorough investigation, which was extremely negligent. It should be severely reprimanded and ordered to report truthfully within a week on those who manipulated the market during the storms of May and June, without favoritism, and to be punished in accordance with Article 42 of the Exchange Law." Another order to the supervisors of the two exchanges, Wang Xiaolai and Yu Kaizhan, stated, "During May and June, the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange repeatedly experienced storms of market manipulation. The supervisors did not pay attention to the causes of market price fluctuations in accordance with Article 42, Paragraph 1 of the Exchange Law and did not report them to the Ministry in a timely manner, which was extremely negligent. Although the officials have been working hard since the Minister arrived in Shanghai to investigate, they were negligent in advance and should be transferred for disciplinary action."</p>
<p>Both Yarn and Flowers See Declines</p>
<p>Although the 42 brokers who were previously punished were all listed on the market yesterday, the number of transactions was still sluggish. The prices of standard yarn for each month, except for September futures, all saw declines. This month fell by 1.3 yuan, July fell by 1.6 yuan, and August fell by 8 jiao. Only September rose by 8 jiao. The prices of standard flowers for each month also fell. This month fell by 5 fen, July fell by 1.5 jiao, August fell by 2 jiao, and October fell by 5 fen.</p>
<h3>The Flour Exchange Suspended Trading Yesterday</h3>
<p>After Completing the Supplementary Margin Call Today, Trading Can Resume as Usual.</p>
<p>The Flour Exchange experienced a disturbance once the week before last. Fortunately, it was resolved quickly with the efforts of the Council of the Exchange. Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, considering that flour is related to the people's livelihood, was even more concerned and personally went to the Exchange to investigate and issued a handwritten order to prevent speculation and manipulation. At the end of last week, the market price soared again. The Council made another supplementary margin call. Yesterday, because the supplementary margin call was not completed, trading was temporarily suspended. After completing the supplementary margin call procedures today, trading can resume as usual. However, according to industry insiders, there are still many hidden concerns about the future of the market price.</p>
<h3>Yang Hucheng Left the Country This Morning</h3>
<p>Song and Sun Both Sent Representatives to Bid Farewell. Yu Youren and Others Held Farewell Banquets Yesterday.</p>
<p>Yang Hucheng, the former Director of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, was ordered by the Military Commission to be appointed as a special military inspection commissioner, accompanied by his secretaries Wang Linge and Kang Weike, his staff officer Fan Erong, and his wife and son. He will leave the country on the President Hoover of the Dollar Line at 11:00 a.m. today. He will go to the United States first. The ship arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong at 5:00 p.m. yesterday and docked at the 11th and 12th pontoons. Mr. Yang is scheduled to take a special ferry to cross the Huangpu River around 10:00 a.m. At that time, all parties will go to the ship to bid farewell. Mr. Yang has been busy with social engagements these days. At 12:00 p.m. yesterday, more than 200 people from the Beijing, Shanghai, and Shaanxi communities, including Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, held a grand farewell banquet at the International Hotel. Deng Shishan, the military commander of the Provisional First Army, and Li Zhigang, the Shaanxi Provincial Commissioner and Mr. Yang's representative in Beijing, were also invited to attend. Mr. Yang expressed his mission abroad and his expectations for his fellow villagers. Yu Youren and Liu Shouchong, a member of the Central Committee, held a banquet for Mr. Yang at the New Asia Hotel at 7:00 p.m. yesterday.

<h3>This City Applies for Early Elections</h3>
<p>All Candidates Give Up Election. The Headquarters Telegraphed to Apply Early.</p>
<p>The date of the National Assembly representative election was previously stipulated by the National Election Headquarters as July 20 to 22 for three days. It is heard that the Shanghai Municipal National Election Office telegraphed the Headquarters yesterday, stating that Shanghai is an industrial and commercial city and that ordinary industrial and commercial citizens have no time to vote until Sunday. In order to take care of the convenience of voters, the election in Shanghai should be advanced by three days to July 18 (Sunday). It is unknown whether it will be approved. The original telegram is recorded as follows, "Urgent, Nanjing National Election Headquarters. Previously, the election date was set for July 20 to 22. These three days are Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. There is no problem with the voting time for rural villagers, but in the industrial and commercial city of Shanghai, ordinary industrial and commercial citizens must ask for leave to vote, which means that they will either lose their wages or give up their right to vote, which seems to be detrimental to the election. It is found that July 18 is Sunday. It is proposed to approve the Shanghai election to be held on July 18 in advance to facilitate voting by citizens. Is it feasible? Please telegraph for instructions." Abbreviated below.</p>
<p>In addition, the National Election Headquarters stated that the representative candidates in various places had been produced long ago and now there is a date for the re-election. If anyone voluntarily gives up their qualifications for election, they should apply to give up before the end of June. A telegram was sent to the Municipal Election Office the day before yesterday to inform them. The original telegram stated, "The candidates in various places have been produced for a long time. If anyone voluntarily gives up their qualifications for election, they should declare it early. Now that the election period is approaching, if they are allowed to give up again, the replacement reporting and verification will take time back and forth, which will inevitably affect the schedule. It is hereby ordered that the deadline for all candidates to apply to give up is the end of June." After receiving the order, the Municipal Election Office has sent letters to the candidates to inform them.</p>

<h3>The Plum Rain Has Caused Repeated Storms and the Sea Dike in Pudong is in Danger</h3>
<p>Mr. Du Yuesheng Again Asks to Repair the Dike. Police Chief Tang Also Asks to Repair It.</p>
<p>The Gaoqiao Sea Dike has been in disrepair for years, and the dangers are becoming increasingly serious. Since last autumn, the situation has become even more tragic. Mr. Du Yuesheng, a member of the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association, has seen this situation and is deeply concerned. He has sent letters to the authorities asking them to speed up the rescue. The details have been seen in this newspaper before. Because of the continuous spring rain and repeated storms, the remaining soil of the damaged dike is becoming more and more eroded, and the danger has reached its extreme. Therefore, yesterday, he sent another letter to the Bureau of Public Works, requesting to start the rescue work immediately to ensure the safety of the people. The original letter is recorded as follows, "Dear Sir, The Gaoqiao Sea Dike has hundreds of holes and the dangers are becoming increasingly serious. I have repeatedly requested that your Bureau start rescue work as soon as possible to ensure the safety of the people. On April 12th of this year, I received your letter, saying that you have already submitted a report to the Municipal Government for approval of the funds for handling the matter and that you will start work as soon as the funds are received. The local people were relieved to hear this news and looked forward to the arrival of funds. However, almost three months have passed, the plum rain has arrived, and storms have repeatedly occurred. The remaining soil of the damaged dike is becoming more and more eroded. From the Huangjiazhai of the Shuidao area to the Daijiazhai area, there is no complete dike to be seen within more than ten miles. The storms are fierce, and there is a danger of collapse everywhere. If rescue is not carried out as soon as possible, the disaster of communication between the inside and outside and the cohabitation of fishermen will not be far away. At that time, not only will the local area suffer a catastrophic disaster, but the government will find it even more difficult to rescue it with a small amount of money. Yong has witnessed the situation with heartache and cannot sit idly by while both the public and private sectors suffer heavy losses. Therefore, I respectfully send another letter to state the situation and urge your Bureau to consider the emergency and start rescue work immediately to relieve the people and ensure their safety. I am very grateful. Respectfully, Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works Director Shen."</p>
<p>Tang, the director of the Gaoqiao Police Sub-bureau, has seen that the dike along the coast has collapsed since the flooding of the autumn tide last year, and the situation is precarious. He has repeatedly submitted reports to the Municipal Police Bureau and forwarded them to the Bureau of Public Works to repair the dike, but the work has been delayed due to lack of funds. Since the beginning of this month, there has been more rain and high tides, and the dike has been further affected. After investigation, Director Tang found that the dike in the Longwangmiao Daijiazhai area was the most severely damaged and was in imminent danger. He immediately prepared an urgent document and submitted it to the Municipal Police Bureau to forward it to the Bureau of Public Works, requesting that workers be sent to repair it immediately. It is heard that the general bureau has now received instructions stating that, according to the reply from the Bureau of Public Works, the funds for repairing the East Dike have been ordered by the Municipal Government to be issued by the Bureau of Finance and that work will begin as soon as they are received.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Resolved Yesterday That This Year's General Budget Should Be Tightened.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council held a regular meeting yesterday. More than a dozen councilors attended, including Liu Zhanen, Xu Yongzuo, Li Fuxun, Qin Runquan, Wang Xiaoji, Lu Jingshi, Xu Xinliu, Wu Yunqi, Yu Zhiqing, and Wang Yiting. Chairman Wang Xiaolai presided over the meeting. The report on various matters is omitted. Matters for discussion: ⑴ The Municipal Government sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting review of the second-level general budget for the 26th year of this city. After the budget review committee reported its review opinions, the resolution was passed. It briefly stated that if no new taxes are levied on the income side of the city in the 26th year, there will be a deficit of 3 million yuan. On the expenditure side, the expenditures belonging to various agencies (ie, Items 1 to 8 of the general budget of regular expenditures) account for 73.86% of the total amount, and the expenditures for repaying debt principal and interest and other expenditures (ie, Items 9 to 14 of the general budget of regular expenditures) account for 26.14%. Among the expenditures of various agencies, salaries account for 53.11% and office and other expenses account for 46.89%. The cost of infrastructure construction, such as road repair costs, accounts for only 1.5% of the total expenditure. In contrast, the importance seems to be disproportionate. In addition, subsidies account for 4.1% of the total expenditure. Given the current financial situation in this city, it is also considered too large. All expenditures for this year, except for public security expenses related to local security and necessary expenditures for maintaining credit, must remain unchanged. Various construction projects for roads and ditches should also be improved according to their urgency. However, administrative expenses should be reviewed and tightened in accordance with the previous recommendations of the Council at a standard of 80% actual expenditure and reorganized. Other expenditures should also be reviewed and implemented in accordance with the review opinions of this session to ensure that funds are not wasted and that the results are practical. ⑵ The motions proposed by councilors Liu Zhanen, Wu Yunqi, Zhu Xiaolai, Chen Bingqian, and others were discussed in turn and passed separately. The details are omitted.</p>
<h3>Chen Bei Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Cantonese Currency Will Be Completely Abolished Starting Next Year. Except for Guangxi, the Currency System Has Been Unified.</p>
<p>Chen Xing, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, accompanied Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council, to Guangdong to reorganize the Cantonese currency system. The work was completed the day before yesterday. He returned north by the President Hoover of the Dollar Line from Hong Kong, accompanied by Bei Songsun, the manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, and Fan Heyan, the secretary of the Central Bank. He arrived in Shanghai at 5:30 p.m. yesterday. According to Chen Min, who spoke to reporters from various newspapers on the ship, "I was instructed by Minister Kong to go to Guangdong with Standing Committee Member Song to discuss the method of reorganizing the mill currency. After careful study, it was decided to exchange the mill currency for national currency at a price of 144. Starting from January 1, 1938, the mill currency will be completely abolished, and the national currency will be the standard. This solution is satisfactory to the authorities and merchants in Guangdong. Except for Guangxi Province, the currency system in our country has been unified. This is very gratifying. I also inspected the affairs of the Guangdong Branch of the Central Bank. After completing the work, I returned to Hong Kong to wait for the ship to return north. Standing Committee Member Song still has important official business and will stay in Guangzhou temporarily. It is not yet certain whether he will go to Guangxi."</p>

<h3>Record of Contemporary Figures' Whereabouts</h3>

<h3>Flexible Collection of Land Abandonment Fees in the City Center</h3>
<p>Encouraging Landowners to Find Ways to Build, Those Starting Construction This Year Will Be Exempted</p>
<p>In order to prosper the city center, the municipal government has periodically collected land abandonment fees on leased land to encourage landowners to find ways to build and complete the city center area plan. The City Center Area Construction Committee has found that there are many landowners who are building houses, but the majority have not yet built as scheduled. The purpose of collecting land abandonment fees was originally to encourage landowners to find ways to build, not to increase revenue. As the municipal government commemorates its 10th anniversary, it seems appropriate to make some flexible arrangements to show leniency, reduce the burden on landowners, and encourage them to build enthusiastically. Two flexible measures have been drafted: ① Any landowner in the city center area who is required to pay land abandonment fees before the end of the 26th year, if they can start building houses between July 7th and the end of the same year, the land abandonment fees they should pay will be specially exempted. ② For all households that have already built houses or are building houses before July 7th of the 26th year, the land abandonment fees they have paid will be refunded. These flexible measures have been submitted by the committee to the municipal government for approval.</p>

<h3>National Products Manufacturers Association Requests Abolition of National Goods Transfer Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, in order to request the abolition of the national goods transfer tax, submitted a letter to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying: Minister Kong of the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, I have read in the newspapers that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has submitted a request to your ministry for the prompt abolition of the national goods transfer tax, which is sufficient to hinder the production and sales of national goods and affect the national economy. Members of the association deeply feel the pain of the national goods transfer tax and unanimously support and sympathize with this request from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The national goods transfer tax is a domestic transit tax, which has long been criticized by the Chinese people. In July of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the government had already expressed its intention to abolish it on a regular basis, but only because tax revenue was being offset, it was still under discussion. Now that the government has levied income tax for half a year, the source of tax revenue is extremely abundant. The general budget for the 26th year has included this tax revenue of 25 million yuan to offset the national goods transfer tax, so there is no need to worry about it being insufficient. This is precisely the time for the government to support national goods industry and cultivate the national economy. It is hoped that you will consider public opinion and abolish the national goods transfer tax as soon as possible to benefit industry and commerce and maintain the foundation of the country. We cannot but sincerely pray for this.</p>

The name is the Sino-Japanese Financial Friendship Association, which is organized by seven representatives from the Japanese side, including the branch manager of Yabuki Shokin Bank, the branch manager of Yoshida Mitsubishi Bank, and representatives from other banks, and twelve representatives from the Chinese side, including Zhou Zuomin, Qian Yongming, Xi Demao, and representatives from other major banks.

<h3>Shanghai Police Bureau Enlarges Memorial Week, Cai Jinjun Speaks on the Mission of the Police</h3>
<p>Cai Jinjun, Director of the Shanghai Police Bureau, in order to implement the spiritual instruction of officers and police, summoned all officers and staff of the bureau, including the heads of various departments and branches, approximately 800 people in total, to gather at the headquarters at 8:00 AM yesterday for an enlarged memorial week. After the rituals were performed, Director Cai gave a speech entitled "The Mission of the Police," which was very encouraging to all officers. The original words are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Under the current circumstances of intertwined internal and external troubles, the economies of both urban and rural areas are collapsing, and the people are living in misery. During this period of national crisis, what kind of mission do the police have? What kind of training policy should be adopted to achieve our goals of national salvation, survival, and national rejuvenation? This is what we cannot ignore. Our task, in a negative sense, is how to prevent problems before they occur and ensure the safety of people's property. In a positive sense, we must also strive to govern, save the people, benefit society, and improve the happiness of the people's lives, so that all people can work together to promote the arduous work of restoring and revitalizing the nation. Today, I will speak on three points:</p>
<p>First, we must review what we have done in the past. The police can be said to be the local weights and measures. In other words, they are the standard of conduct for the people. We should be the example and model for the people, encouraging and guiding them, not exploiting, destroying, oppressing, or deceiving them. If we resolve difficulties for the people, have benevolent intentions, act justly, behave with dignity, and be pure and without vices, the people will definitely cherish us, listen to our guidance. If we endure hardship, hate evil like an enemy, are not tempted by profit, not subdued by power, and are upright and bright, the people will definitely respect and fear us and dare not do wrong. The difference between the police and the people is only in the different duties. Their common creed is to be loyal to their duties and abide by the law. We review everything in the past, whether we have set an example, worked hard, and served honestly. If we are in a position to lead the people and cannot abide by the law first, how can the people believe us? As the saying goes, "If you are not upright, how can you correct others?" Then you have lost the qualification to lead the people. Chairman Chiang, in his instruction to the graduates of the senior class of the police academy, said, "If you want to change the current decadent customs of the police, you must first respect your personality to improve the general public's perception of the police. Those who respect themselves are always respected by others, and those who love themselves are always loved by others. To revive the decline and start anew, you should uphold the spirit of revolution and strive for moral cultivation." Chairman Chiang's words are truly a morning bell and evening drum that awaken the deaf and blind, because the action of saving the country must come from the people's self-awareness. How can the people feel, experience, and be aware of the task of saving the country? The police must first be self-aware. In the past, the credibility of the police was too low. Everyone must respect their personality and correct or improve the general public's new understanding of the police. If the police first respect their personality, they can exert their own effect, and the people will naturally imitate and move upward. "As the saying goes, 'If those above have good intentions, those below will definitely have even more.'" In this way, not only will the police and the people remove the barriers between them, but they will also increase their sympathy for each other. Once this sympathy is illuminated and ignited, you can immediately see the power. If the police themselves are inconsistent in their words and deeds, it is not easy to want the people to be law-abiding. How can they exert great power in the national salvation movement? Today, I warn everyone that in the future, no matter what rank of officer or policeman, if they dare not to examine themselves, once discovered or reported by the people, and the facts are verified, they will be severely punished without exception and will never be tolerated. Moreover, I have said to the local gentry in the past that I hope that all citizens will jointly report and expose them. The director of this bureau will keep the information confidential so as to thoroughly investigate and severely punish them.</p>
<p>Second, we must recognize what we should do. The success of everything must first have a doctrine and must first have a spirit of sacrifice. If you are drunk and dreaming, living for the moment, fearing the head and tail, and worrying about gains and losses, you will never succeed. If we recognize our own responsibilities, we will value our responsibilities. Since we have taken on such a profession, we will do our best to perform our duties. Whether it is eliminating criminals and thieves or relieving disasters, we do not focus on treating the diseases that have already occurred, but on preventing or eliminating diseases that have not yet occurred. We should have certain standards for all kinds of training, as well as physical and intellectual abilities, and directly seek benefits for the people. As long as it is our own duty, we should rush forward without fear and never give up. As the saying goes, "Cannot be subdued by power," then we can seek benefits for the people. For example, a police chief at the 16th Pier recently was able to risk his life to defend against thieves and protect the people. This is enough to qualify as a policeman. If you are thinking about the amount of reward before doing anything, then you can do nothing. The duties of the police in this city are heavy and the salary is too low. This is an undeniable fact. However, after investigating the whole country, Shanghai is not considered too low. There are many that are not as good. We cannot compare ourselves to the police in the concession. Everyone should grieve for the people's lack of vitality, and save the country from danger. If the country is not preserved, where is the home? No matter how poorly the country treats you, you are a part of the country. Give your heart and soul every day of your life. Be loyal and steadfast, persevere, and work hard consistently. That is what it means to "cannot be moved by poverty or lowliness." Do not be vain, do not be extravagant, do not be tempted by people's interests, do not be blinded by people's wealth. No matter how you are bought, do not be moved, do not lose your personality, fight for justice, and move forward for justice. This is called "cannot be corrupted by wealth." We, based on this true spirit of not being corrupted by wealth, not being moved by poverty or lowliness, and not being subdued by power, as long as we recognize what we should do now, we will resolutely do it without hesitation, without cowardice, and without disgracing our mission. Exert one point of strength and get one point of effect. Fulfill one day's duty and get one day's achievement. This spirit can overcome all current difficulties and can make the entire nation revive, guaranteeing the survival and security of the entire nation.</p>
<p>Third, we must determine our direction, promote our policies, and strive to realize our future ideals. Whether our ideals are realized depends on our training. Our training goals are: ① First, break the old concept of selfishness, self-interest, and hedonism. Everyone should respect their own personality from self-awareness and self-love, develop courageous and sincere talents, and contribute their talents to the country and the nation. ② Cultivate a true spirit of enduring hardship and shouldering heavy responsibilities, being hardworking and complaining. No matter how difficult and harsh the environment is, we must find ways to struggle and work hard. At the same time, we must enrich ourselves, not show weakness, not be discouraged, and overcome the environment. ③ Make every policeman revolutionary in order to shoulder the important responsibility of transforming society. ④ The police must be able to organize the people, train the people, and stand together on the same line of national salvation, making the people militarized, militarizing the people, making the people like the police, and making the police like the people.</p>
<p>With zealous, brave, and sincere police who are willing to take responsibility and can lead the general public, there can be a fully self-aware and self-saving citizenry. Police training is the best policy for saving the country and the people and is the reserve army for national revival. All officers and police personnel should be invigorated, tense, determine our direction, work together, promote our policies, and strive to realize our ideals. The police are prepared to jointly unleash the greatest power of the entire nation and make our greatest contribution to the work of saving the country.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Submits a Request to the Ministry for Establishing an Iron Smelting Plant</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a request to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Industry, stating the matter as follows: The Chamber convened its 8th Members' General Assembly on June 19th, based on a proposal from the Iron Printing and Can Manufacturing Trade Association, requesting the government to establish an iron smelting plant to manufacture iron sheets so that commercial use can be self-sufficient and prevent huge losses of wealth. The proposal stated, "Upon investigation, black and plain iron sheets (commonly known as tinplate) are produced in European and American countries. The number imported into our country is very large. Because of the high demand, the quantity of imports increases year by year. According to the import statistics of the International Trade Bureau for the 25th year, the quantity of tinplate (quintals) is 5.490, the value (gold units) is 103.887; the quantity of plain tinplate is 396.207, the value is 5985.500, and the total quantity is 401.697, the value is 6089.387. The numbers listed on the right are shocking. Moreover, since the major producing countries have intensified their war preparations, the prices have soared. Once war breaks out and sea transport is blocked, the source will inevitably be cut off. Not only will the axis of the industry not be able to progress, but more importantly, the iron smelting industry is a vital industry for a modern country. Without steel, there is no national defense. The world unanimously recognizes this. Please ask the General Assembly, with the status of a national commercial group, to request the government to establish an iron smelting plant in the shortest possible time to smelt steel to achieve self-sufficiency. The surplus can also be used to manufacture tinplate for commercial use. The government has already established paper, sugar, and alcohol factories one after another. The importance of steel is ten times greater than the above-mentioned items, and it is urgently necessary to prepare for it. The Hanyang Iron Works has existing regulations. It is only necessary to reorganize it and hire foreign specialized technicians to realize the plan. It is not difficult. It is proposed that the government authorities use political power to start preparations. If the financial resources are insufficient, more commercial shares can be added. In addition to this industry, related hardware industries will also be happy to invest. Moreover, the ore from Daye is of excellent quality and can be used locally, which is extremely convenient and does not conflict with the loan agreement with Japan. The greater matter is that national defense can be consolidated, and the lesser matter is that the industry can be self-sufficient without shortage. Is it feasible? Please make a public decision." After the General Assembly discussed the results, it was generally agreed that iron is needed for people's daily use and national defense. At this time of international war preparations, the supply of goods is becoming scarce and prices are rising, which is already deeply felt. Jin iron is mostly locally made and only for the province's own use, with very little coming south. In addition, the only thing that can be relied upon is the Liuhegou pig iron, which produces only about 30,000 tons per year. The government and the commercial market each purchase half of it. According to the needs, the shortage is very large. The Yufan ore in Anhui and the Daye ore in Hubei are sold to foreigners at extremely low prices, which is a pity. Previously, the Ministry of Industry had a plan to establish a steel plant. If the official shares are difficult to fully achieve at once, then adding commercial shares can also achieve the effect of many people lifting together. It was resolved to request the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry to prepare for the establishment as soon as possible. The case is recorded and submitted to your institute (ministry) for review and approval for implementation, which is of public convenience.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Literature Exhibition to Open on the Morning of the Seventh of Next Month</h3>
<p>More than 8,000 Exhibits Already Assembled, Display to Begin Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Literature Exhibition, which has been preparing for more than a month, was originally scheduled to open on July 2nd. It has been learned that because the city government's other exhibitions will all open on the 7th, the exhibition has also been changed to open to the public from 10:00 AM on the 7th for three weeks. In terms of exhibits, the total number in all categories has exceeded 8,000, and collectors from various places are still continuing to collect exhibits and are sending important exhibits that are being searched for to the exhibition, with the number still exceeding 2,000. However, the exhibition area of the Municipal Museum is limited, so it is planned to divide all the exhibits into several periods and replace them for display. Taking the 8,000 exhibits currently received as an example, the classics, calligraphy, paintings, and bronzes from dozens of counties in the past dynasties are all available. The historical materials and images are also magnificent. Many of the exhibits are not easily shown by collectors at ordinary times. This gathering together for public exhibition is truly an unprecedented event in Shanghai. The office of the association is currently rushing to handle the receipt, registration, classification, and cataloging of items. The president, Mr. Ye Yuhu, is personally operating and directing everything, working extremely hard. The original exhibition rooms upstairs in the museum have been cleared out and converted into the venue for the Literature Exhibition. The downstairs has also been rearranged and is still used as the museum's exhibition room, displaying the museum's original masterpieces and newly collected items, such as the entire collection of banknotes donated by Mr. Fan Guangzhen, □□□ donated the history of the enshrinement of the Premier, Mr. Yang Xiaotian donated souvenirs of the Qihua incident, and the ancient cannons and ancient coins sent by the police bureau, all of which are new acquisitions of the museum. On the Literature Exhibition side, the display will also begin today. All staff members have extended their office hours to after 10:00 PM, and the situation is very tense.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Orders Protection of Antiquities</h3>
<p>The Central Antiquities Preservation Committee stated that in recent times, at famous historical sites in the country, tourists often inscribe words on buildings, damaging the original appearance, and those who repair them also often add decorations arbitrarily, change the appearance, or arbitrarily damage or alter the shape, all of which are not ways to preserve historical sites. It specially requested the Ministry of Interior to forward the request to the Executive Yuan to issue an order to all provincial and municipal governments to strictly prohibit tourists from writing or engraving commemorative texts on any ancient buildings, sculptures, or paintings. The repair of antiquities and historical sites should also be handled by the organizing agency, which should first prepare descriptions, including the original condition, the extent of damage, and the repair methods and preservation plans, and send them to the committee for review before construction can begin in order to protect the remains. The Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday received an order from the Executive Yuan and has already forwarded it to the Social and Police Bureaus for compliance.</p>
<h3>Joint Fundraising by the Radio Industry</h3>
<p>Radio Stations Broadcast Special Programs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Wireless Broadcasting Industry Association and the Wireless Material Industry Association have launched a joint fundraising campaign due to the severity of floods and droughts in various provinces.

<h3>Yangtze River Floods Exceed Previous Year's Water Level</h3>
<p>Hankou Water Level Surpasses Forty Feet, More Than Six Feet Higher Than the Same Period Last Year, Dangerous Reefs Discovered Upstream of Yichang</p>
<p>The Yangtze River flood situation is still very critical. At the same time, reefs were discovered in Yichang, and the customs specially ordered ships traveling upstream to pay attention to safety. The situation is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Hankou Water Level Surpasses Forty Feet</p>
<p>According to Jianghai Customs news, the highest water level of the Yangtze River since the great flood in the 20th year (of the Republic) was in the year before last, and the lowest was last year. The Hankou water level on June 27th of the year before last was 39 feet and 2 inches. The Hankou water level for the same period this year (i.e., yesterday) has reached 40 feet and 0.5 inches (the same period last year was only 33 feet and 9 inches), exceeding the water level of the year before last by more than one foot and exceeding the water level of last year by six feet and six inches.</p>
<p>Comparison of the Same Period in the Previous Two Years</p>
<p>According to Jianghai Customs records, the highest Hankou water level in the year before last reached 46 feet and 5 inches, on August 1st of the lunar calendar. The highest Hankou water level last year reached 40 feet and 0.1 inches, on August 15th and 16th of the lunar calendar, both during the peak flood season. This year's peak flood season has not yet begun, and the Hankou water level has already exceeded the highest water level of last year's peak flood season. The seriousness of the situation can be seen.</p>
<p>Reefs Discovered Upstream of Yichang</p>
<p>In addition to the rising water level, another event that deserves attention on the Yangtze River is of great importance to navigation. According to the report of the Port Affairs Section, a reef was discovered outside the Shiliang extension, 314.2 nautical miles upstream of Yichang. When the water level drops to zero, the reef is only about six feet below the water surface, which is very dangerous. Ships traveling upstream on the Yangtze River must pay attention to it quickly.</p>
<h3>Woman Dies Tragically After Abortion</h3>
<p>Dong Guizhen, a woman from Changshu, 21 years old, worked as a hostess at the Daxin Amusement Park. Last year, she became intimate with Wu Bingrong and lived together at No. 8 Xiexing Lane, Alabastor Road. Recently, Guizhen was three months pregnant and planned to find a way to have an abortion. After being introduced by Mrs. Li Yu, a local woman living at No. 7, Lane 28, Yunnan Road, she asked Mrs. Wang Zhang, a midwife at No. 169 Parker Road, to perform the surgery. The fetus was aborted, but she became seriously ill. Wu and others sent her to Guangren Hospital for treatment. The doctor verified that it was caused by an abortion. The Xinzha Patrol Station was notified, and the Huishi Patrol Station sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. Mrs. Wang Zhang had already fled after hearing the news, and there was no way to arrest her. Mrs. Li Yu was arrested and sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special First Court on the 24th of this month for prosecution in accordance with Article 290 of the Criminal Law. The details have been recorded in the newspapers. Unexpectedly, the Dong woman's condition worsened before yesterday, and she died after failing to rescue her. The body was taken to the forensic examination office on Ferron Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang, appointed by the Special First Court, arrived at the office to examine the body and verified that the deceased Dong Guizhen, female, had died of illness caused by an abortion before her death. The body was handed over to her mother, Dong Wang, who signed a guarantee to claim it.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Fresh Eggs from Our Country Shipped to England</h3>
<p>According to sources in the British side of this city, a large quantity of fresh eggs from our country has recently been shipped to England. These fresh eggs are all produced in the Yangtze River basin. The quality is several times better than that of England's production, and the nutritional power is also more abundant than that of England's domestic production. The British are now using it to make cakes and other things, which is very popular. The British side has now decided to continue to purchase these fresh eggs from our side.</p>
<h3>Soviet Musician's Music Disaster Relief Exhibition Postponed</h3>
<p>Due to Mrs. Kliliova's Recent Discomfort</p>
<p>Mrs. Kliliova, a Soviet national residing in Shanghai, specially invited several comrades to hold a music disaster relief concert at the Chinese Art and Science Society on the 10th of next month to raise funds for disaster relief because of the severe Sichuan disaster. However, due to Mrs. Kliliova's recent discomfort, it is feared that it will be difficult to proceed as scheduled. It is planned to be held in the autumn.</p>
<h3>American Music Authority Shang E Leaves Shanghai to Return to the United States</h3>
<p>Invites Mei Lanfang to Visit the United States Again</p>
<p>Mr. Shang E, an American music authority, has been in Shanghai for a week since arriving directly by Pan American Airlines on the 20th. He is scheduled to return to the United States by ship via Japan this morning. According to Mr. Shang, he came to China this time to find and hire Chinese drama talents to perform in the United States because Americans are extremely interested in Chinese drama. Mr. Shang also said that he met with Dr. Mei Lanfang once during his stay in Shanghai to invite him to perform in the United States again, but there has been no result. He decided to come to China again in the shortest possible time to negotiate everything and hopes that Dr. Mei will agree to visit the United States again.</p>
<h3>Statue of Huang Huannan, Deceased Supervisor of Sincere Company</h3>
<p>Unveiled Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Huang Huannan, the deceased supervisor of Sincere Company, passed away in August of last year. In order to commemorate Huang, the colleagues of the company built a bronze statue of Huang in front of his tomb in Lianyishan Cemetery to show their admiration. The statue was made by a famous Italian sculptor and was recently completed. A ceremony was held to unveil it yesterday morning at 9:00 AM.

<h3>Disciplinary Conference of Political Personnel Decides to Punish</h3>
<p>Yan Renguang Dismissed from Office and Suspended from Employment for One Year, Bao Keyong and Xu Xueyu Demoted One Grade and Reappointed</p>
<p>Yan Renguang, former Director of the Department of Electrical Administration of the Ministry of Communications, and Yu Ruxin, Chief Engineer of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, concurrently operated the business of the United Dahua and Lida companies, which were related to their duties, monopolizing the purchase of electrical materials by the Ministry. Yu Ruxin also took the opportunity of Yan Renguang's suspension of the Ministry's Shanghai Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Factory to use his qualifications as the factory director and manager of Dahua to input the excellent technical workers in the factory to Dahua for work. Xu Xueyu, the current Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry, Bao Keyong, the Director of the Telegraph Bureau, and Zhang Chengyou, the former Managing Engineer of the International Radio Station, and Li Hushen, the former Chief Technical Officer of the Ministry, also concurrently operated the business of the new electrical company, which was related to their duties, and monopolized the purchase of electrical materials with the Ministry as their only major customer. With a capital of 25,000 yuan, the annual business ranged from 300,000 to 1,000,000 yuan. The National Telecommunications Workers' Union of the Ministry and the Mingguang National Goods Electrical Materials Factory, etc., successively sued the Supervisory Yuan for using their powers for personal gain and malpractice. The Supervisory Yuan approved the Executive Yuan, which forwarded it to Wei Yifu and others, technical supervisors of the Ministry, for investigation and report. The investigation commissioner, Ding Qixiang, found out the above-mentioned situations. The supervising committee members Wang Pingzheng, Yao Yuping, and Zhang Hualan proposed impeachment. The supervising committee members Liu Chengyu, Zhu Zongliang, and Wang Guangqing reviewed the case and believed that it should be transferred for punishment. The Central Public Disciplinary Committee has now decided that Yan Renguang will be dismissed from office and suspended from employment for one year, Bao Keyong, Yu Ruxin, Zhang Chengyou, and Xu Xueyu will each be demoted one grade and reappointed, and Li Hushen will not be punished.</p>
<h3>Shanxi Province Begging Representatives to Host All Circles Today</h3>
<p>Report on the Process of Requesting Accounts</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring this year, there has been no rain in the Hedong area of southern Shanxi. The stored grain has long been exhausted, and the new harvest is very poor. Many cotton plants have not been planted. The suffering of the people is difficult to describe in words. In order to seek a thorough relief method, the Hedong Disaster Relief Association sent representatives Zhu Rongen and Luo Zengshou to Beijing to beg for relief from the central government and to call for donations from all parties in Shanghai. The representatives contacted various parties in Beijing and Shanghai for many days, and the government and various charitable organizations generously agreed to provide assistance, and there have been considerable results. It is reported that the representatives need to return to the province urgently to handle association affairs and will leave Shanghai in the next few days. They have specially scheduled a tea party at 5:30 PM today on the 9th floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to invite the press and fellow Shanxi natives in Shanghai to report on the progress of their contacts with various parties.</p>
<h3>Caojiadu Fire Brigade Pays Tribute to Sacrificed Members</h3>
<p>The Caojiadu Fire Brigade in western Shanghai paid tribute to the sacrificed members of past years at 10:00 AM yesterday and held a fire fighting skill competition in the afternoon at the Jianfeng training ground in Caojiadu Ham North. About 300 guests participated. The director of the association, Yu Yuqing, and the captain, Zheng Liankun, led all the members to perform fire fighting work. The Fire Prevention and Security Agency sent personnel to participate in the demonstration of the axe and helmet brand fire extinguisher. A temporary shed was built for the performance. When the fire was raging, the machine was turned on, and in an instant, the fire was extinguished and the smoke disappeared. The guests were very satisfied with this achievement. The photography session ended at about 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Zhang Ruiluan Goes Abroad to Investigate the Paper Industry</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Liyun, a giant in the Chinese paper industry, has been operating the Xie Feng Foreign Firm and the Xie Shen Paper Company for decades and deeply understands that the paper industry has a great relationship with a country's culture, and in this era of increasingly urgent international storms, it has a close relationship with national defense. In recent years, Chinese industrialists have gradually paid attention to this so that they can achieve self-sufficiency. However, at present, there is a lack of outstanding talents. Mr. Zhang, in view of this, specially sent his son, Mr. Zhang Ruiliu, on the President Hoover today to go abroad to investigate the situation of major paper mills and companies in major paper-producing countries such as the United States, Germany, England, and Sweden for reference. After graduating from a domestic university, Mr. Zhang Ruiliu has repeatedly had the ambition to go abroad for further study, but for the past five years, he has been busy assisting his father's business, which has not been realized. Now he has this good opportunity. With Mr. Zhang's rich experience in the paper industry on weekdays, coupled with the academic theory and technology obtained from the European and American investigations, he will surely become a special talent in the Chinese paper industry in the future. Once he returns to the country, his contribution to the promotion of Chinese culture can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Hongqiao Sanatorium to Build Civilian Wards</h3>
<p>To be Completed by the End of September</p>
<p>The Hongqiao Sanatorium in western Shanghai is a famous specialized hospital for treating heart and lung diseases in our country. Since its establishment, it has been more than three years. Due to the perfection of the facilities, the number of people going to the sanatorium is increasing day by day. However, the sanatorium only has first and second class wards. In view of the current social and economic situation, it is necessary to add civilian wards. A summer dance party was specially held last month, and all the proceeds were allocated to the construction costs, which have all been raised. In addition, the donations of Mr. Ye Gongchuo, Li Shizeng, Shi Yonggeng, Yao Weixiong, Zang Boyong, Zhuang De, Zhuang Daqing, and Xue Xueqian were also appreciated to see it completed. The construction of the wards is still designed by the famous architect Mr. Xi Fuquan and built by the Anji Construction Factory. At present, construction has officially started. The internal adoption of light and air is extremely careful. Every two beds have isolation walls, just like the cabins in the ship, and the design is very novel. It is estimated that all of them will be completed by the end of September. It is heard that the hospital is well-known at the time for its implementation of lung surgery and the examination of heart diseases.</p>
<h3>Guyin Painting and Calligraphy Association Disaster Relief Exhibition Opens Today</h3>

<h3>Regarding the Case of the Merchant Shipping Bureau's Objection to Li Guojie's Stock Pledge Right</h3>
<p>Li had already been detained in court at the time of the pledge. The facts of the pledge must be verified through witness questioning.</p>
<p>Li Guojie, the former General Manager of the state-run Merchant Shipping Bureau, was involved in a civil lawsuit related to an embezzlement case. The Merchant Shipping Bureau discovered that Li had mortgaged 50,000 yuan worth of stock to Siming Bank. Consequently, the Bureau requested the court to seize the stock by its authority. Jin Shang, the legal representative of Siming Bank, objected and filed a lawsuit against Li Guojie and Cai Zengji, the current General Manager of the Merchant Shipping Bureau, seeking payment of debt and confirmation of the execution of the pledge right, and exclusion of obstruction. The complaint stated roughly that on November 25th of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), the defendant Li Guojie pledged Changhua Iron Ore Company stocks numbered 41 to 45, with a face value of 50,000 yuan, and a British pocket watch inlaid with enamel, to the bank for a loan of 30,000 yuan in national currency, with an agreed monthly interest rate of one percent, for a term of six months. Upon maturity, he was unable to repay and repeatedly extended the loan, as evidenced by a personally signed pledge note from Li. Unexpectedly, Li Guojie was convicted of embezzlement by the Supreme Court, and execution began. The state-run Merchant Shipping Bureau discovered the aforementioned stock and petitioned the court to order its surrender. The complainant had already legally obtained the pledge right for the stock and filed an appeal with the Jiangsu High Court. According to Article 962 of the Civil Code, a possessor may request the removal of any obstruction to their possession. Furthermore, Article 7 of the Supplementary Regulations for Civil Execution stipulates that a third party with a pledge right over the subject of execution may use a lawsuit of objection to resolve compulsory execution. Therefore, they requested a judgment ordering the defendant Li Guojie to repay 30,000 yuan in national currency, confirming the complainant's pledge right over the Changhua Iron Ore Company stock and the British pocket watch inlaid with enamel, and prohibiting the defendant state-run Merchant Shipping Bureau from compulsory execution. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Guocheng held a continued hearing. The plaintiff's attorney, Shi Naixiu, appeared in court to present the case, while Li Guojie, being in Beiping, did not appear and was represented by attorney He Xiantong, who stated that Li Guojie fully acknowledged the plaintiff's claims. At this point, attorney Man Hechun, representing the Merchant Shipping Bureau, presented a defense, stating that the pledge right was allegedly established on November 25th of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), but the only document presented to prove the establishment of the pledge right was signed on November 25th of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935). This document was claimed to be for the purpose of agreeing to an extension to avoid foreclosure and was not a document proving the establishment of the pledge right. Without a document establishing the pledge right, how could there be a procedure for modifying the agreement? Siming Bank's claim to the pledge right should first be supported by a document establishing the pledge right. Until the initial document establishing the pledge right is presented, the Bureau has no way to investigate whether it legally exists. Furthermore, without Li Guojie himself present, it is difficult to inquire in detail about the facts of the pledge at the time and various circumstances. It was requested that the execution and criminal files be collected. At this point, attorney Shi stated that Li mortgaged the stock on November 25th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), requesting a correction. The entrusted lawyer then stated that Li committed embezzlement on November 14th of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), he had been escorted to the court and was unable to move freely. Whether the mortgage to Siming Bank was personally signed by Li should be determined by summoning the person in charge of Siming Bank at the time of the pledge to testify. The court ordered that Sun Hengfu, the former general manager of Siming Bank, and the person in charge at the time of the pledge be summoned for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Judge Personally Inspects Case of Postal Truck Injuring Laborer</h3>
<p>Initial trial: Truck driver sentenced to two months imprisonment, suspended for two years. Unsatisfied, he appeals. Judge personally goes to the scene for a reenactment.</p>
<p>Xie Jinwen, a laborer from Jiangbei, worked as a "pheasant laborer" transporting postal packages at the dock for the post office. On the evening of November 6th of last year, after finishing work, he and his fellow workers boarded postal truck number 3, driven by Li Guifang. Upon arriving at Xinkaihe in the French Concession and stopping, the workers jumped off the truck. As Xie jumped off last, the truck had already started moving, causing Xie to fall and his left foot to be crushed by the wheel. He recovered after a long period of medical treatment, but had become disabled. Xie hired attorney Wu Peng to file a lawsuit in the Special District Court, accusing Li Guifang and the German director of the Postal Administration, Zha Peilin (transliteration), of negligent injury, and filed a civil suit seeking damages of 10,800 yuan. As a result of the trial, Li Guifang was sentenced to two months imprisonment, suspended for two years, and the civil suit was transferred to the civil court. Regarding the civil suit, Judge Ma Yishu of the Special District Court held several hearings to investigate. The case was continued and reviewed yesterday morning, and the conclusion of the debate was announced, with a judgment scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 30th. However, Li Guifang, dissatisfied with the criminal court's judgment, appealed to the High Court Third Branch, which also conducted several investigations and detailed hearings. A hearing was held a few days ago, ordering the appellant to drive postal truck number 3 to the scene of the accident. Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi, along with Judges Chen and Wang, Prosecutor Dong, the police department, and the attorneys for the appellant and appellee, personally inspected the scene of the accident at Xinkaihe in detail, and ordered Li Guifang (the appellant), Xie Jinwen (the victim), and the laborers, postmen, and postal workers who were on the truck at the time to reenact the situation at the time of the accident. Yesterday afternoon, another hearing was held. After questioning various witnesses, the court believed that the facts of the case were clear, ordered the conclusion of the debate, and announced that the judgment would be rendered at 2:00 PM on the 30th. After the announcement, the court ordered a further investigation into whether there was a footboard on postal truck number 3. The appellant was ordered to drive the truck to the front of the Special District Court, where Presiding Judge Wu, along with the judges and attorneys from all parties, left the court to inspect the truck in detail. There were footboards on both sides of the truck. The truck was then ordered to be driven to the middle of the road, and everyone who was on the truck at the time was ordered to reenact the situation of getting off the truck when the accident occurred. After the reenactment, the presiding judge and others returned to the court, questioned everyone present, and adjourned.</p>

<h3>Zhang Qiming and Wife Reconcile Dispute</h3>
<p>Zhang Qiming, a native of Wuxi and the Chinese manager of the Jiangxi Road Maoli Foreign Firm, was betrothed to Wu Zhuoqi, the daughter of Wu Yinquan, from the same village, in his youth. They have been married for eleven years. In March of this year, the two had a disagreement, and Wu hired attorney Du Xi to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, seeking cohabitation and alimony. At the same time, Zhang Qiming hired attorneys He Shimmei and Wang Chuanbi to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, seeking a divorce from his wife. The court approved the lawsuits and summoned both parties separately. Zhang's lawsuit against Wu was summoned once and ordered to attempt reconciliation outside of court. Wu's lawsuit against Zhang was heard by Presiding Judge Li Hu on the 19th of this month, who advised the parties to attempt reconciliation outside of court. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the time for another summons arrived, and both parties, accompanied by their attorneys, arrived at the court on time. Presiding Judge Li Hu again sat in the Sixth Civil Court, and both parties stated that they had not reached a reconciliation outside of court. Judge Li repeatedly persuaded them to reconcile, ordering Zhang to provide Wu with 120 yuan per month for living expenses until Zhang's divorce case was adjudicated, and Zhang would deposit the living expenses into the Xinhua Bank. The parties then signed an agreement to reconcile.</p>
<h3>Sanbei Shipping's New Jiang Lun "Taiping" Merges into "Long'an" and Runs Aground in Xun</h3>
<p>Bottom of the ship is stuck in a sandbar, Sanbei has been dispatched to rescue.</p>
<p>The "Long'an" of the Sanbei Shipping Company in this port, is one of the new ships purchased by the company, and is now operating the Shanghai-Hankou and Changsha route. Last Wednesday, the ship departed from Shanghai, and at 4:00 am on the 27th, the ship arrived at the Jiangmian River surface 26 nautical miles below Jiujiang. Due to fog, the ship ran aground. At that time, the owner measured the water scale around the ship, and knew that the draft of the front of the ship at the grounding site was only eight feet, causing the hull to sink deeply into the sand, making it impossible to move. The owner sent a telegram to Jiujiang requesting a tugboat for rescue. The company's "Qingbo" was dispatched for help, but the bottom of the "Long'an" was touching a beach on the northeast side of the grounding site, and the "Qingbo" was unable to tow. Yesterday, a report was sent to Shanghai, and the head office dispatched the small "Sanbei" to attempt a rescue, because the draft of the small "Sanbei" is shallower, and it may be able to sail closer to the "Long'an" and rescue all the passengers first. If the hull cannot be towed out, the cargo will have to be unloaded before attempting a rescue.</p>

Due to the recent decrease in the amount of deposits, due to market conditions, it was discussed to merge with Guohua Bank, which may be realized on the first of next month. The internal organization of Guohua will also be reorganized, the capital will be expanded, and there is talk of promoting Shen Shuyu, the Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, to chairman of the board.</p>

<h3>Huzhou Boy Kidnapped by Cousin</h3>
<p>Sun Zukun was the mastermind, court had first interrogation yesterday.</p>
<p>Gui Luchen from Huzhou, who lives at No. 5 Wangjia Lane in the city, his only child, Shunkang, was lured to Shanghai by his cousin, Xu, on the 17th of this month. She colluded with Shen Ke (aka Sun Zukun), a Yong man from No. 127 Jining Road, Yangshupu, to hide Shunkang in the small sister's place of the Xu family at No. 6 Caojiadu, using a pseudonym to write a letter to Weng Gui Luchen demanding a ransom of 5,000 yuan, which was later increased to 10,000 yuan. The case was discovered by the police of the Caojia Police Station, who arrested Gui Xu and rescued the meat ticket Shunkang. She was taken to the bureau for detention and questioned, revealing Sun's residence. The police detective, Han Yushan, from the Municipal Police Bureau, requested assistance from the Yulin Road Police Station at 2:30 am the previous morning. Police Chief Zhao Ziren and Liu Zhisheng secretly went and apprehended Sun and took him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Attorney Qian Xunjiu explained the case and stated that the defendant was the mastermind, the two ransom letters were drafted by him, and Gui Xu was instructed to copy them before sending them to his uncle to threaten and extort the ransom. He presented Gui Xu to the court to testify. According to her testimony, she is 32 years old, Shunkang came to Shanghai on the 17th of this month, and the next day he went to Sun Zukun's home, where he planned the event, and was actually fooled by him, and begged for discretion. And the child Shunkang testified that Xu is his sister-in-law, and that day she went to the school and told him to go to Shanghai for a wedding banquet, followed her to Shanghai, and then went to the defendant's house, and saw him writing the draft of the letter with a brush, and he didn't know anything else. When questioned, Sun denied the allegations in a vague manner. Judge Xiao Bianfen briefly questioned the detective Han Yushan and ordered Sun Zukun to be detained and rescheduled for review.</p>
<h3>Guo De Shun Sugar Firm Owner Guo Zhuqiao Accused of Embezzling Large Inheritance</h3>
<p>Six half-siblings, the youngest being the plaintiff, accuses the brother of embezzling one-sixth of five million yuan. Defendant did not appear, court ordered summons, or arrest for non-compliance.</p>
<p>Guo Taixiang, a native of Chaoyang, Guangdong, residing at No. 105 Yong'an Lane, Matthews Road, this year 27 years old, recently hired attorney Li Mo to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing his brother Guo Zhuqiao (a director of a certain bank residing at No. 535 Avenue Joffre, the owner of Guo De Shun Ren Ji Sugar Firm) of embezzling an inheritance amounting to one-sixth of a total of five million yuan, and filed a civil suit. According to the complaint, the plaintiff and the defendant are half-siblings. Their father, Rui Ting, had six sons, the eldest being Shi Runqing, the second son being Zhuqiao (the defendant), the third son Tai Gong (deceased), the fourth son Wei Yi, the fifth son Tai Zhong (deceased), all born to Mrs. Zhang, and the sixth, the plaintiff Qin Xiang, born to Mrs. Mu. When their father passed away in the second year of the Republic of China (1913), the plaintiff was only three years old and still in his infancy. The other brothers were all engaged in their own affairs. All the inheritance and the Guo De Shun Ren Ji Firm, which their father jointly operated with their uncle Bai Xiang, were managed by the defendant alone. There have been no reports on the financial situation. The plaintiff was initially ignorant, but after becoming an adult, he repeatedly requested a division of the inheritance, but the defendant, taking advantage of the plaintiff's youth, ignored him. However, the brothers did not question the defendant's use of funds. This spring, he renewed his request, but the defendant replied that there was no inheritance. The plaintiff suffered from the fact that he was very young when his father passed away, and even if there was an inheritance, he did not know the details. It was not until April 10th of this year that he discovered a red account report of Guo De Shun Ren Ji Firm audited by accountant Jiang Wanping on March 20th of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935) at his nephew Yi Cao's place. It became clear that the defendant had a red account report for the firm up to the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930). In the 8th year of the Republic of China (1919), Guo De Shun Ren Ji Firm already had assets of more than 1.3 million taels of silver. The principal and interest would now be more than 4 million taels, equivalent to 5 million yuan in national currency. The plaintiff's rightful share has been completely embezzled by the defendant. The plaintiff believes that the defendant's actions constitute a crime under Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and requests that he be investigated and prosecuted according to the law, and files a civil suit requesting the court to order the defendant to hand over all the accounts for calculation, etc. The court accepted the complaint and summoned the defendant once, but he did not appear, and the case was rescheduled. Yesterday, Criminal Court Judge Liao Bi came to the Second Criminal Court to summon the defendant again, but he still did not appear. Only the plaintiff and his lawyer appeared and claimed that the defendant was deliberately refusing to appear. They requested the court to issue an arrest warrant. The judge said that the court had sent police to the address on the complaint to summon him, but the people there said that the defendant did not live there. The plaintiff said that the defendant actually lived at No. 535 Avenue Joffre and never went out. Even if there were social engagements, he would not attend. He had a reputation, so there were two iron gates inside and outside the house to ensure his safety. The judge also said that it would be better to reconcile this case outside of court. The plaintiff replied that there had been mediation before, but the defendant only agreed to pay 200,000 yuan, which would be divided among the five brothers, which was too far from the amount of the inheritance, so it was put on hold. This money is still in the bank. The judge verified the statements and ordered that the case be rescheduled and an arrest warrant be issued for the plaintiff to identify and summon the defendant. If the defendant refuses to comply, he will be arrested and prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Brewery Workers Continue Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>Party and government representatives agreed on two measures yesterday, and decided to continue mediation at the company again this morning.</p>
<p>The workers of the British-owned Shanghai Brewery at No. 130 Yichang Road, Husi, went on strike on the 22nd of this month because their requests to restore wages and reinstate the dismissed workers were not accepted by the factory. The strike has been going on for several days and has not yet been resolved. The details have been reported in this newspaper several times. It is now known that all the workers continued the strike yesterday. In order to eliminate the dispute and prevent it from escalating, the Party and government organs of this city sent personnel to mediate again yesterday afternoon, and put forward two pre-emptive measures, and decided to continue mediation this morning. The details are as follows by the Dagong reporter,</p>
<p>Failure to Resume Work Yesterday</p>
<p>All the workers of the Shanghai Brewery previously had their wages reduced due to the factory's slow business, so the workers demanded the restoration of their original wages due to the peak summer season. Because the management only agreed to increase wages by two yuan and did not restore the original amount, they expressed dissatisfaction. The factory management believed that the factory union was directing this, so they dismissed Zhu Liangfu and other enthusiastic union members, which aroused the workers' indignation and declared a joint strike on the 22nd of this month. There was a conflict with the police detectives, which caused a serious dispute. Although the Party and government organs of this city tried their best to mediate, it was not resolved due to the factory's insistence. All the workers of the factory continued their strike yesterday. As for the rumor that work would resume yesterday, it did not materialize.</p>
<p>Party and Government Agree on Preemptive Measures</p>
<p>In order to eliminate the dispute, the Party and government organs of this city sent Cao Peizi from the Municipal Party Headquarters and Zhang Chuqiang from the Social Affairs Bureau to the company's office on Sichuan Road at 3:00 pm yesterday to meet with Manager Hong Kai for mediation. The Party and government representatives put forward two pre-emptive measures, (1) The factory must allow all workers to return to work, and (2) The handling of worker treatment issues and other important personnel issues in the future must pay attention to the authority of the Chinese Party and government organs, and must first request approval before implementation. As a result of the negotiations, the factory expressed strong agreement with the second issue and fully accepted it. They still insisted on the first item unconditionally and insisted on dismissing some workers. The Party and government representatives argued with them for a long time, and as a result, they agreed to consider and reply later. The Party and government organs representatives decided to continue mediation at 10:00 am today to avoid prolonging the dispute. A Dagong reporter spoke to Mr. Cao Peizi, the person in charge of the Municipal Party Headquarters, who said that foreign businessmen should comply with Chinese laws and regulations when setting up factories in China, and that they are naturally responsible for protecting workers' actions within the legal scope.</p>
<p>Police Continue to Arrest Workers</p>
<p>The previously arrested workers are still under negotiation and are expected to be completely released. However, the Chinese and Western detectives of the Putuo Road Police Station investigated and found that the striking workers used violent means to illegally detain the factory foreman Pan Hanrong, workers Tian Arong, Lu Huating, Ji Mingzhou, Pu Yunsheng and other five people in the factory union in Zhabei. As a result, on the previous day, they arrested Zhu Liangfu, Li Zhisheng, Wang Youzhi, Xiong Yongchang, Han Renfu, Gu Zhengyuan, Zhang Xiaocheng, Zeng Fengyi and other eight people and took them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Attorney Li Zhishan filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 302 and Article 304 of the Criminal Law for obstructing freedom.</p>
<p>Three Released on Bail, Five Returned to Custody</p>
<p>After hearing the testimony of the foreman Pan Hanrong and worker Tian Arong, proving the situation of being illegally detained and intimidated, the defendants all pleaded and hired lawyers to defend them in court. Judge Chuan Lin reviewed the confessions and ordered the conclusion of the debate in this case. The defendants Han Renfu, Gu Zhengyuan, and Zeng Fengyi were each released on bail of 100 yuan, and the remaining five people including Zhu Liangfu were returned to custody, awaiting judgment on the morning of the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Student Missing</h3>
<p>Lu Cailiu, a 17-year-old student in the casting department of the Zhonghua Book Company's main factory, a native of Chuansha, has always been very loyal. He suddenly disappeared after receiving a payment on the 24th of last month. There is no news of him so far. He only has a 60-year-old mother at home who cries day and night. It is said that he was scheduled to get married in November, so the bride's family is also very anxious. If anyone finds him and sends him to (Mr. Ni's place at No. 96 Hejia Lane, within the concession) will be rewarded with 50 yuan. A reward of 20 yuan will be given to anyone who provides information leading to his whereabouts.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Cruel Contrast</h3>
<p>— Hong Fa</p>
<p>In this human society, there are many things that seem unbelievable, but are actually very common. For example, when street performers often ask for money from the audience, they bring their children and step on their stomachs with their feet. At this time, there are actually spectators who find this cruel phenomenon amusing. If someone were to ask: Do human beings really have no compassion? I can answer: Yes! That is "it has been this way since ancient times, and it is even more so now." Of course, people are not born this way, but since the private ownership system was established, human compassion has gradually eroded and diminished. They spend all day in the circle of enriching themselves at the expense of others, and exclusion, competition, and competition have become everyday occurrences. The long-term result is the formation of an extremely selfish mentality.</p>
<p>For example, in the current drought in Sichuan, the most severely affected areas have more than forty counties. Farmers cannot even find grass roots and tree bark to eat. However, according to investigations, local wealthy gentry and officials are hoarding large quantities of food and deliberately raising market prices, refusing to sell. Speaking of the causes of the disaster, we can find more reasons, saying that it is due to the exploitation of feudal forces. However, the creators of this catastrophe can instead sit idly by and watch others die without helping. Isn't this a strange thing?</p>
<p>But the strangeness does not stop there. According to a telegram from Chongqing on the 24th from a certain newspaper: "The third levy of land tax in the 26th year. It is now determined to levy once in the first half of the year and twice in the second half of the year. Except for western Sichuan, which is scheduled to begin on July 1st, the rest will begin on September 1st. It is hoped that the provincial treasury's income will gradually increase."</p>
<p>From this telegram, it can be seen that although Sichuan Province is said to have a major disaster, land taxes still have to be paid, and even three times a year. The ability of the people of Sichuan to sustain life can truly be said to be beyond the ordinary! Those who died have died, and those who are fortunate enough to be alive are still eating inorganic matter to recover. Even so, there are still people who want to take advantage of them, thinking that "oil can be squeezed out of chaff."</p>
<p>"The gradual enrichment of the provincial treasury and the increasing poverty of the common people are forming a cruel contrast!</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of Being Buried Alive</h3>
<p>— Li Geng</p>
<p>I remember a news story about young orphans being buried alive. They suffered from the shackles of feudal remnants and the poisonous flames of old morality, losing their lives in vain. And now, in a corner of our country in the Northeast, a large-scale tragedy of being buried alive has been staged in the name of "patriotism"! These two types of people being buried alive share the same fate as the oppressed! The brutal aggression of imperialism and the anesthetizing harm of feudal remnants are equally significant problems for China at this stage.</p>
<p>"Recent news from Beiping: Over three hundred patriotic individuals in the Northeast were recently buried alive by a certain party... It is only known that this incident was due to a traitor informing a certain party, who then arrested individuals from various schools in the Northeast provinces based on this information. Many were young students, including the Director of Education of the pseudo-Xing'an Province. The certain party identified this Director as the leader. During the execution, a deep pit was dug in a certain location. Over three hundred people were lined up at the edge of the pit, and each person was struck heavily on the head with a wooden stick before being pushed into the pit. The Director was the last to be struck and pushed into the pit. Before being struck, the Director requested two minutes of 'spiritual freedom' from the certain nation's executioner, which was granted. The Director then shouted 'Long live the Republic of China!' As the sentence ended, he was struck and buried with soil. It is said that the provinces of the Northeast are in a state of constant terror."</p>
<p>Anyone with hot blood and a sense of justice, upon reading this news, would not fail to feel "chills down their spine," followed by grief and lamentation!</p>
<p>The fate of the enslaved people of the lost province has long been in the hands of the invaders. Because of "the traitor's betrayal," they can carry out their vicious "live burial" methods. What justice can be talked about? In the past, countless compatriots in the Northeast, especially intellectuals, were captured and harmed! But now it is "becoming increasingly worse"! Being "buried alive" for "patriotism" shows that the enslaved people of the lost province have no freedom to be patriotic. But ultimately, dear compatriots sacrificed their lives loving their "motherland." Why is this? The same people, having fallen into the fate of slavery, and being so cruelly treated for loving their country, "who caused this"? The fervent expectations of the compatriots in the Northeast, their hearts laid bare, have ultimately been met with only disappointment!</p>
<p>There is no need to say that the youth are the backbone of the nation, and even more so, the intellectual youth are the pillars among the youth, and no one would deny this. The words "protecting the youth and nurturing the youth" are already the "fashionable words" of the adults and gentlemen—but, when such news reaches their ears, I wonder if they will feel some alarm? If they continue to endure being slaughtered and harmed like this, it will only be a futile waste of the "nation's vitality"!</p>
<p>The certain Director of Education, witnessing over three hundred young compatriots with a sense of justice being活活地"pushed into the pit with a head-on blow," so in the two minutes before his "blow," he burst out with the roar of "Long live the Republic of China!" What kind of eager and urgent expectations they had for their "motherland"! And his roar was painful and indignant enough!</p>
<p>Because of the roar of the patriotic martyrs, how should we be vigilant, and more importantly, how should we immediately use the facts to comfort their heroic spirits buried in the "earthen pit"?</p>
<h3>Mother Chen</h3>
<p>— Fang Qian</p>
<p>"Uncle Changgen... What's wrong? Is our Xiaosan sick?" Mother Chen paused her laundry work, holding the brush in her hand and staring at Uncle Changgen. Uncle Changgen, dressed in black cotton clothes, exuded the air of the countryside as he sat on a wooden stool. He had just come from the countryside yesterday, and brought Mother Chen a message: her son was sick.</p>
<p>"Well, Xiaosan returned home on the third day of the new year. He couldn't walk anymore and came back in a small cart. According to him, the illness started when he was kicked in the stomach by his master, and he felt闷闷的(depressed). He slept on the floor at night and caught a cold, and the next day he had a fever." Uncle Changgen sighed.</p>
<p>"Is it serious?" Mother Chen's mouth drooped downward, and then she swallowed, clearly anxious.</p>
<p>"It seems like it might be dangerous... but maybe it's not serious. Still, Auntie Xiaosan, I think it would be best if you go home and see him."</p>
<p>"But I, here, the Madame doesn't..." Suddenly, another voice interrupted her.</p>
<p>"Mother Chen, the Madame is calling you."</p>
<p>"Oh, oh, I'll be right there. Uncle Changgen, you can go back now. Thank you so much, I'm sorry for making you run errands. Now—go on."</p>
<p>Mother Chen let Uncle Changgen leave and quickly went to the Madame. The Madame wanted her to cook lotus seeds.</p>
<p>Mother Chen, in her forties, already looked very old. She was of average height and had thin lips. When she talked to people, she always smiled and then swallowed. But she was very honest, just a bit slow. She could wash ten pieces of clothing in the time others could wash fifteen or sixteen. Originally, she was a wet nurse for the Second Miss. Now, the Second Miss was fourteen years old, lively and intelligent. The Madame saw that she was diligent and the Second Miss got along well with her, so she kept her as a maid.</p>
<p>Mother Chen placed the pot with the lotus seeds on the stove.</p>
<p>The intense flames scorched Mother Chen's ashen face. She stood motionless, like a stunned chicken, staring at the wall. What was so good about the wall? The white plastered wall was blackened by smoke, with a shrine of the Stove God set on it.</p>
<p>But Mother Chen seemed to see her child in the ashen wall: she saw her Xiaosan holding his stomach with a pair of thin hands like a bundle of firewood, rolling around, desperately shouting in a hoarse voice that he was in pain...</p>
<p>"Sizzle—sizzle—" Mother Chen was suddenly awakened. It was the sound of the lotus seeds overflowing into the flames. She quickly scooped it out with a spoon, letting it continue to cook.</p>
<p>Then, Mother Chen fell into contemplation again, but was awakened by the Second Miss:</p>
<p>"Mother Chen, your letter."</p>
<p>"Huh? Mine?" Mother Chen was stunned. Her cheeks twitched, and she knew something was wrong. "Good Miss, then please read it to me, what does it say inside—what, but—wait." She remembered</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>the lotus seeds, and hurriedly gave them to the Madame. The Madame insisted: "It's too bland, add some sugar," and took yellow sugar,</p>
<p>then said white sugar would be really delicious. Mother Chen took hurried steps,</p>
<p>finally she said, mumbling, looking at the Second Miss: "He</p>
<p>will be alright, right?"</p>
<p>"Xiaosan is seriously ill... no money to hire a doctor... return quickly"</p>
<p>"Xiaosan is your son, right?"</p>
<p>"What to do then? What will be good?" The corners of her mouth drooped</p>
<p>down, and she swallowed again, her cheeks twitching, turning red.</p>
<p>She decided. She went to the Madame—</p>
<p>"A week, Madame... give me a week off"</p>
<p>She kept swallowing.</p>
<p>"But who will do the work here?" the Madame</p>
<p>asked with a nasal tone.</p>
<p>"Have pity on me, Madame, he is ill—ill, he</p>
<p>as soon as he gets better, I will come back right away, pity—pity me</p>
<p>!" Her voice trembled, almost crying.</p>
<p>"Well—" The Madame hesitated, "</p>
<p>you must come back in a week, or else—</p>
<p>But a week passed, and Mother Chen had not returned.</p>
<p>The Madame was eager to have help and found another sturdy</p>
<p>and strong person.</p>
<p>Early in the morning on the tenth day, Mother Chen came with a bundle</p>
<p>, her face even paler, with dark circles around her eyes.</p>
<p>"You are late, I could not wait for you to come back," the Madame</p>
<p>said coldly, "Take the lotus seed bowl and wash it, Zhang Ma."</p>
<p>Mother Chen was stunned for a moment, her eyelids drooping, but</p>
<p>immediately she understood: but this was not something that could be achieved by begging,</p>
<p>so she relaxed her shoulders and straightened her back,</p>
<p>as if nothing had happened: "Madame,</p>
<p>I'm leaving." So she really left.</p>
<p>Relying on her strength to make money, she had no children anymore</p>
<p>, neither worrying nor fearing, "Relying on my old bones to earn a living"</p>
<p>She thought.</p>
<h3>Countryside Snippets</h3>
<p>— Ye Jiayi</p>
<p>㊀ Secluded House</p>
<p>I am like a fisherman from the Jin Dynasty, breaking into this world beyond the world. When the spirit is immersed in the illusion of this reality, the worries of the mundane world and the disputes of human affairs truly make one feel overwhelmed by feelings of foolishness, mediocrity, melancholy!</p>
<p>This three-bay, ancient-colored simple house reveals its vigor and detachment amidst its old age: it shelters the previous generation who bear the life and death of the land, and also protects their children and grandchildren. It embraces a peaceful heart and wants to always warm their tired minds and bodies. This deep feeling that maintains loyalty is constant and simple; like people's affection for their land.</p>
<p>The bay of river in front of the door is as dead as an ancient deep pool, and the green moss like flocs easily makes one aware of the blue sky foreshadowing rain. Congealed cloud masses: the leaves of wild water chestnuts and the round duckweed are intricately interwoven in patterns, and there is also a small boat tied under the shade of the willow. Who can help but fantasize about entering a non-worldly fairyland with this carefree and transcendent charm!</p>
<p>It shouldn't be too much to say that this is a fairyland! Isn't the essence of heaven and hell, different from each other, happiness and pain? Here, they live in an ancient paradise away from the civilized world. When the father walks through the fence gate from the nearby fields carrying bundles of golden wheat ears, what kind of true feelings do the daughter and the family dog show to greet this head of the household: this sweet, comforting, and leisurely interest may not be something that those who claim to be in heaven can enjoy. Their worries are not the failure of investments, the decline of power, or the entanglement of love; as long as the fields of grain grow abundant ears, the domestic fowl by the fence are not diseased, or the vegetables of today can be exchanged for a family's coarse meal in the market town, then those are their peaceful days! Their simple farmer's dreams also live in the breath of the earth.</p>
<p>Clusters of shade cover the flat roof of this old house, covering these simple souls; the generations of people in the secluded house simply retell the stories inherited from their grandfathers to their children, with the sound of insects in the steps and fields composing the heavenly song of the stars twinkling in the night.</p>
<p>——Be an honest farmer... I thought of a line from a Russian poet.</p>
<p>㊁ Bamboo Forest</p>
<p>In the bright and dazzling sunlight, what can give your thirsty heart a bit of cool feeling is this bamboo forest. The clusters of bands, bright, newly green leaves that cannot be colored by artificial means, gush out such a wealth of vigorous life and youth. The newly grown tender bamboos that are scattered and staggered have just taken off the woven coats they brought from the soil, supporting themselves so gracefully. Their slender, small, naked bodies make people think of the accompanying dancers in ancient paintings of fairies.</p>
<p>Our own family grew up in the bamboo forests of the mountains. Our grandfathers and fathers all relied on them to support their descendants. When we gave birth to a new generation, the old bamboo mothers were cut down by us and sold to the people in the city. They grow in succession, and we cut them down in succession, but when our unworthy generation constantly slaughters the young bamboo shoots, our forests finally collapsed! And then our family also fell apart.</p>
<p>Now this dense garden in a foreign land makes me miss that ruined mountain forest in my distant hometown! When I was young, my grandfather often said stories like "rely on the mountains in the mountains, rely on the sea at the sea," but he never imagined that people outside the mountains would one day invade the mountains and forests! Honest mountain people will destroy their own property and perish.</p>
<p>Silently sitting on a stone in the shade of the bamboo, I摇着刻engraved childhood dreams on the bamboo and softly read the song a girl gave me.</p>
<h3>Sea Journey Notes (1)</h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>The Korean man had a seven or eight year old boy with him. He was very thin, with a small face and round eyes, dark skin, lively and mischievous. Whoever looked at him, he would roll his small white eyeballs at you for a long time, jumping from this iron bucket to that one. He wasn't afraid at all in the wind and waves. Sometimes he fell, but he didn't cry or shout. He would touch the place that hurt from the fall, and still jump around. Above the lower deck hatch, a twelve or thirteen year old boy with a pockmarked face was sleeping. The little Korean spat and threw it at the pockmarked face, waking him up. He chased after him with his fists clenched. When he came back to sleep again soon, the Korean came back to tease his ears, or jump around him. Two children of different nationalities chased each other and made a fuss. The Korean father laughed, and the Chinese watching the fun also laughed, and said appreciatively:</p>
<p>"This little guy is really bad, look at you, alas, poke his nostrils..."</p>
<p>Encouraging such small children to insult Chinese children is like exploiting their fathers to smuggle, only in a microcosm.</p>
