<h3>沈家灣展開血戰市中心區敵軍移援劉行</h3>
<p>我軍前綫補充嚴密準備痛擊　昨晨敵軍進犯閘北被我擊潰　大場浦東南市昨遭敵機轟炸</p>
<p>敵軍正傾全力總攻之際而市中心區江灣虹口一帶之敵、突於一日早晨五時向從撤退、自此消息傳播後、驚喜交集、競相測度、莫知究竟、有謂因少壯軍人與偽滿鮮台軍自起內閧、妨礙軍事行動、但據可靠消息、確因上述各處、旣不能破我防綫、乃調動該處兵力、集中劉行、向我總攻、現市中心區其美路西北、三民路以南、陸家角以西、縱橫三公里之區內、已無敵踪、但三民路以北天祿寺方面之敵、仍盤踞不去、日來敵全力攻我羅店至劉行之綫、均經我痛擊、受創殊重劉行北面之太平橋、兩日來各出死力血戰、得失者再、敵軍砲火雖猛、我軍氣燄殊熾、浴血抗戰、卒將敵軍擊潰、收復原來陣地、羅店西約一公里之沈家灣、展開空前血戰、至記者屬稿時、猶在激戰中、我軍憑堅固工事、奮勇衝擊、决無差池、劉行止面、敵集中砲火、向我陣地猛烈矗炸、我方工事雖略有損壞、現已加緊佈置完固、進攻退守、絕對有把握、昨日敵未敢再犯、戰事轉趨沉寂、閘北方面、前夜敵軍進犯、經我痛擊後、敵勢收歛、據我高級指揮官談、我軍前繼、均已補充就緒、實力充足、防務堅固、前方將士、俱抱抗戰到底之决心、對於持久作戰、極有把握、最後勝利、必然歸我云、</p>
<h3>沈家灣激戰未已劉行鎭轉趨沉寂</h3>
<p>敵犯施相公廟被我痛擊重創　太平橋激戰兩日終被我克復　劉行鎮我加緊佈置陣地鞏固</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者二日午後八時報吿、敵第四次總攻、集中火力於羅店至劉行方面、猛烈進犯、激戰三日、本日僅羅店西約一公里之沈家灣一處、敵不斷進擾、激戰未已、迄報告時尚在相持中、其餘施相公廟進犯之敵、經我軍迎頭痛擊、受創損重、已不敢再來、劉行北之太平橋、兩日來敵我各出死力往返衝擊、得失數次、終為我軍克復固守、劉行鎮正面、敵數度進擾、迄未得逞、惟我陣地工事經敵軍猛烈轟擊、略有損毀、刻正沿滬太路之西、加緊佈置、進攻退守、均有充分把握、本日此綫轉趨沈寂、敵機十二架於拂曉出動、在全綫上空來回窺察數匝、旋在大塲我軍陣地、投彈多枚、並無損失、市中心區以西之敵、向後移動、據探悉在其美路西北三民路以南、陸家角以西、縱橫約三公里之區、敵蹤已絕、惟三民路以北天綠寺方面、敵仍盤踞不去、敵軍此方面移動之目的、似係集中力量、企圖向劉行方面突進、</p>
<h3>某總司令談羅店劉行屹然未動</h3>
<p>前綫陣容補充就緒實力堅强無比　咸抱必死决心最後勝利必歸於我</p>
<p>中央社記者、一日赴前綫軍次訪謁某總司令、據談、我軍堅守羅店劉行一綫、戰况雖稱劇烈、但我陣地屹然未動、我雖迄未下令反攻、驅敵出境、惟敵亦不能再作寸進、持久之戰、我軍已操左券、北方我軍前週稍見失利、刻已調生力軍反攻、此種暫時進退、决不至影響全局、至滬戰開始以來、我前綫各師之損失、現已補充就緒、其實力依然堅强無比、卅日江灣閘北方面之敵、向後撤退、推原其故、不外因少壯軍人僞滿鮮台兵士自起內鬨、或係敵軍遷移軍力於他方之兩種原因、總司令復泛談敵軍在淞滬數度總攻、屢戰屢敗、此為鐵般事實、敵實力耗損極鉅、將士為之氣餒、有我前方官兵、人人抱必死决心、欲以其鐵血頭顱保守錦繡河山、千萬將士、為國捐軀、無一出怨言者、蓋我全體官兵、以為此次戰事、不但為爭取中華民族之獨立自由而戰、目為全世界人類求和平伸正義而戰、如我寳山姚營、南口羅團之悲壯犧牲、均可以驚天地而泣鬼神、設無此種觀念、决不能有此精神、較之世界各民族之抗戰精神、固有過而無不及也、最後記者叩以據上而論、我全面持久之戰、最後之勝利必歸於我、總司令卽以堅决之語氣答曰、此必然無疑者也、並承錄贈民族英雄石達開語“忍令上國衣冠、淪於夷狄、相率中原豪傑、還我河山、”此可想見某總司令精忠衛國之丹心也、</p>
<h3>我空軍夜襲敵陣地</h3>
<p>昨夜九時三十五分、我空軍又飛滬夜襲、浦江各敵艦於我機飛臨上空時、倉皇中齊放探海燈、並亂放高射砲與高射機關槍應戰、我機安然飛過、至楊樹浦一帶敵軍陣地投彈數枚、約一刻鐘後全部安返、</p>
<h3>大隊敵機轟炸大塲</h3>
<p>昨日正午、敵機一隊、飛往瀏河轟炸、該處砲火猛烈、敵圖破我陣地、卒未得逞、又昨日上午十時至十一時間、敵機一隊約有十二架至十五架、在大塲及滬太路附近、投彈六十餘枚、三架飛機為特別大型軍用單翼者、</p>
<h3>敵機肆炸南翔嘉定</h3>
<p>前日下午五時左右、有敵機八架、飛赴南翔鎮一帶偵察、在南翔錫滬汽車站附近輪流擲彈、先後竟達廿餘枚之多、南翔錫滬汽車站房屋當卽全被擊燬、該處附近有平民四十餘、亦慘遭炸斃、</p>
<p>中央社蘇州二日電、敵機一日飛嘉定轟炸、當投彈十餘枚、死傷平民百餘人、</p>
<h3>南市浦東敵機肆虐</h3>
<p>敵機一隊、於昨日下午二時三十分至四時餘、不斷向我浦東白蓮涇方面施行轟炸、因敵漫無目標、我方損失其微、又昨日下午五時左右、敵機一隊、突飛至非戰區之楓林橋上空、似企圖轟炸我市政機關、投彈數枚、幸均墮於田野間、雖爆炸並無損失、惟當時敵機以樓關槍向下掃射、結果死傷我無辜平民十餘人、</p>
<p>敵機兩架、於昨晨八時許、飛至浦東欽賜仰殿西首投擲炸彈四枚、二彈爆炸、傷農民一、男孩一、午後三時、又來一架、在楊家宅一帶開機槍掃射行人、幸無死傷、</p>
<p>昨日下午四時半至四時三刻、敵機三架在北新涇附近投彈四枚、被燬草屋數間、河內民船三艘炸沉、死三人、傷九人、</p>
<p>昨日上午七時、敵機兩架、在浦東方面盤旋擲彈之後、竟飛至與法租界新橋街相近百餘步之九畝地豆腐店門前、投下百　磅巨彈一顆、幸未爆裂、其時正値露天菜市上市之際、否則不堪設想、是爲戰事後城內第一彈、嗣經警士將彈舁去云、</p>
<p>昨日下午五時一刻、斜十路三角地天空、忽發現敵機低飛偵察、並用機關槍掃射、當時有一鄕人受傷甚重、據云該處隣近天文台、開戰以來、從未有敵機飛過及偵察、亦無軍事設備及駐軍、昨有敵機偵　察該處、民衆極爲惶恐云、</p>
<h3>虹口市中心區張華浜敵軍撤退增援劉行</h3>
<p>我分兩路搜索包圍市中心區</p>
<p>中央社蘇州二日電、虹口·市中心區及張華浜一帶之敵、自一日起陸續向後撤退、現市中心區附近、僅有少數敵兵、其餘均向北方移動、似係增援劉行方面者、一日下午二時起、虹口方面槍聲甚密、經數小時後始停、聞敵有內變之說、</p>
<p>中央社云、本社隨軍記者二日上午十時報吿、盤距於市中心區淞滬路及江灣黃興路以西地帶之敵軍、開始向東退却後、我軍特派精鉅部隊前進搜索、結果得悉下列各處已無敵踪、㊀三民路以北天祿寺一帶、㊁復旦大學東南之張家巷·奚塘灣·金家巷邱家宅·狄家浜一帶、敵退一千公尺、㊂其美路以東殷家宅·吳家宅以西之敵·完全撤退、㊃翔殷路以南、東西體育會路附近之敵、亦向南退却向江灣路集中、㊄今晨敵運大批地雷、赴市中心區、想必在該處埋置、以防我進據、</p>
<p>市中心區以西之敵、向東移動後刻我軍已調派精强部隊、分由三民路·翔殷路·搜索前進、沿途佈置警戒陣地、以期包圍市巾心區、另有一部、則由賀家巷出泗涇球塲、向敵進襲、迄午前十一時止、尚不見敵踪、故未發生接觸、</p>
<p>江灣區市立第一公墓以東與唐家宅間之河流突然涸淺、我軍探悉係敵軍堵塞河口所致、想敵將利用河身、以行駛坦克車、</p>
<p>薀藻浜以南江灣區邊境張家宅及陸橋宅一帶、有大隊敵軍在該處集結、惟迄尚未有動作、</p>
<p>昨日下午四時半、有敵機三架、自楊樹浦路底敵臨時飛機塲起飛、先在閘北一帶盤旋數匝後、卽西飛至滬西北新涇一帶偵察、在蒲淞鎮北眞北橋附近投七彈、炸斃平民三人、傷九人、炸沉渡船三艘、五時左右、又有敵機一架、在徐家匯西南土山灣天主堂匯南街一帶低空窺察、並不時用機關槍掃射、越半小時許、始行飛去、死傷情形、尚待詳查、</p>
<h3>敵方發表死傷人數</h3>
<p>敵發言人發表、自八月廿三日起、至九月廿七日止、在淞滬全部死傷總數達七千五百卅人、其中死者、計一千八百九十三人、傷者計五千六百卅七人、其數量較上次發表者為多、惟敵方對死傷實數、向諱莫如深、且海軍陸戰隊亦未計算在內、故據估計其死傷總數、約在二萬以上云、</p>
<h3>敵又到騎兵二千人</h3>
<p>敵第四次增援軍一師團及一旅團合約四萬餘人、旬日來陸續開滬、敵軍且已於上月廿八日起開始作第四次總攻、惟因我方陣地鞏固、士氣旺盛、自敵來犯後、又遭我軍痛擊、敵軍傷亡突趨增加、現敵為欲達其速戰速决目的計、决定再續派精銳部隊一師開來滬、其中第一批為騎兵、約二千人左右、於昨日黎明時、由敵商輪改建之第一五八號運輸艦悠紀丸、第二六○號運輸艦Pacific　Maru、第三二四號運輸艦金龍丸、第二八二號運輸艦明光丸等四艘、運載來滬、分別於黃浦大阪匯山三碼頭登陸、同時並另有戰馬大批卸下、</p>
<p>又昨日（二日）上午、續有敵商輸改建之第九一號運輸艦羽黑丸及敵輪長崎丸等二艘駛滬、停靠匯山碼頭、當又有敵大批軍用汽車、坦克車及軍火彈械千餘箱、起卸上陸、</p>
<h3>閘北激戰通宵我機械部隊殲敵</h3>
<p>敵用坦克車掩護步兵衝鋒　我軍分路包抄殲敵二百餘　並斃敵中隊長分隊長四人</p>
<p>前晚以迄昨晨（二日）、閘北方面發生猛烈惡戰、前晚九時左右、敵坦克車掩護步兵、由北四川路分頭西窺、進擾我士慶路口、東寶興路口、虬江路口、中州路口等一帶陣地、人數有一聯隊之衆、蠭擁侵來、以寶興路口虬江路口為數尤多、我軍亦以機械化部隊襲擊敵之坦克車、并掩護步兵迎擊、雙方激戰、殊為猛烈、我軍奮勇衝入、混戰數小時之久、將敵切斷聯絡、重重包圍、予以殲滅、是役敵傷亡極重、在寶興路一帶斃敵一百二十餘人、虬江路方面斃敵九十餘人、其他方面敵亦傷亡一二十人不等、并擊斃敵中隊長一人、分隊長三人、我軍乘勝追擊、殘敵狼狽敗退、我軍直衝至北四川路永豐大樓附近、又在中州路方面擒獲白俄間諜一名、現正羈押究訊中、</p>
<p>昨晨十時敵坦克車四輛、又圖向寳山路我軍陣地侵擾、經我軍奮勇截擊、敵軍未能續進、相持至午、終無結果而退、</p>
<p>再度進犯卒不得逞</p>
<p>昨晨六時至九時間、閘北寳山路·永興路·賓昌路·中央路·及八字橋一帶、戰事激烈、砲聲隆隆、九時以後、靶子路赫司克而路附近、亦有砲聲、至正午未止、我軍曾向寶樂安路·北四川路·虬江路·吳淞路、及白保羅路一帶以重砲猛攻、賓山路·賓昌路·中華新路等處、則遭敵機轟炸、又訊、昨日下午三時許起、閘北八字橋·六三花園·江灣路·北四川路底之敵步兵小隊、又分途向我軍陣地猛烈衝鋒、並用小鋼砲機關槍轟掃、我軍皆俟敵軍衝至三十米、突躍出戰壕、迎頭痛擊、敵屢仆屢起、創亡甚衆、至傍晚止、肉搏十餘次、均經我軍用機關槍等擊退、</p>
<p>閘北民房一片焦土</p>
<p>閘北賓山路一帶昨日因被楊樹浦方面敵砲全日轟炸、且被敵機擲彈、致該處共有十餘處起火、每處燬屋一二間三五間不等、此起彼熄、更迭不已、惟下午二時許商務印書館工塲對過圖書館南首民房、被敵機投擲重彈一枚頓時起火、烟熖密佈、未幾、卽火光熊熊、延燒甚烈、緣該處正值火綫、救火車不能往救、故燒至晚間尚未熄滅、且連日被敵飛機轟炸、故該處一叚約二分之一華里、自水亭南至賓源路止、所有市住房、均被焚燬、已成一片焦土、</p>
<h3>敵方召開軍事會議</h3>
<p>决定總攻重要戰略</p>
<p>中央社云、確息、敵軍各高級將領、曾於上月三十日下午一時起、在天滝路煕華德路口日本電信局、一度擧行重要軍事會議、出席者為敵陸空軍總司令松井、師團長板田、第三艦隊司令長谷川、特別陸戰隊司令大川內、第三艦隊參謀長杉山元藏等十餘人、其討論內容、據記者向各方探悉、為决定此次總攻之重要戰略、而江灣閘北一帶敵軍之所以於三十日午後五時起、卽分路撤退、卽為敵方於此次會議中所决定之重要戰略之第一步云、</p>
<p>大公社云、確息、昨日上午七時起、敵軍最高軍事長官、在外白渡橋日領事館擧行軍事會議、一時該館附近所停之黑牌子汽車、竟達二三十輛、估計參加人員、最少在二十餘人以上、同時“出雲”艦與日領事館之間、亦有汽艇二艘、往來載送官員前往、直至十一時許、仍未散會、並據日方透出消息、昨晨敵方擧行之會議、係討論今後對滬戰之最後作戰等步驟、故在性質上非常重要、第三艦隊司令長谷川、出雲艦長岩村、陸空軍總指揮松井、海軍武官武田、參謀長尾田矢敬等、均親自參加與議云、並悉此次會議後、將由松井與長谷川署名、電呈該國陸海兩省請示、然後進行一切、故滬戰在此一二日內、將有重大新開展、</p>
<h3>晋北我軍二次出擊敵鈴木兵團消滅大部</h3>
<p>我因陣地突出退守雁門關一帶　靈邱廣靈等地我便衣隊極活躍</p>
<p>［南京］軍息、上月二十三日進攻平型關之敵、經我痛擊潰退後、嗣復增兵再犯、激戰終日、斃敵甚衆、乃於二十五日拂曉、我軍郭師行第二次之出擊、並恊同友軍、向敵側背挺進、斷其歸路、將敵鈴木兵團消滅大部、髯獲汽車五十餘輛、及軍用品無算、二十六日殘餘之敵、復得大部增援、向我進攻、激戰至三畫夜、斃敵千餘、惟因該處陣地過於突出、三面受敵、乃於二十八日夜、將平型關·圍城口·西河·凌雲口我軍、撤守雁門關代縣莪口五台山一帶山地、將陣地右翼形成鈎形、（二日中央社電）</p>
<p>［太原］晋北各路我善於游擊之某部、已開抵前綫作戰、敵連日損失甚鉅、聞西犯之敵軍、恐後路被截、有退察凖備、靈邱廣靈等處我便衣隊極活躍、晝夜出擊、敵補充運輸、極感困難、（二日中央社電）</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>蘇聯能不能帮助我們？</h3>
<p>— 胡愈之</p>
<p>蘇聯能不能幫助我們？要問答這一個問題，我們先得問一下自己！我們要不要蘇聯的帮助。</p>
<p>從主觀上說，我們爲求自力更生而抗戰到底，我們相信可以不倚賴一切外力，而得到最後的勝利。　所以我們不需要任何他國的帮助，所以　也不需要蘇聯的帮助。</p>
<p>但是從客觀上說，我們不懂是爲了我們自身的獨立自由而戰，也是爲了受日本侵略威脅的遠東各國的共同利益而戰，爲了全世界的和平興正義而戰。所以，一切友邦，不問是爲了他們自身的利益，或者爲了和平興正義，願意幫助我們，反對日本侵略戰爭，不懂是我們所不能拒絕的，而且也是我們所十分需要的。　假如友邦的援助，能夠使中國抗戰早一天得到勝利，能夠使日本侵略者早一天敗減，我們爲什麼竟不要友邦的帮助呢？</p>
<p>不過我們不能希望一切的友邦，都給我們有効的援助。有的國家，和我們的敵人，有了同盟關係，我們就不能希望得到眞正的帮助。有的國家，雖然願意帮助我們，可是或者因爲地理位置隔離的太遠，痛癢不相關，或者因爲把自身利益看得太重，不願意輕易冒險，或者因爲實力太不充足，我們也不能希望從這些國家，得到眞正有効的帮助。自然，各國人民對中國民族抗戰的同情，是完全一致的。可是單靠這些道義上的同情，斷不會使我們滿足。</p>
<p>因此我們可以希望得到的帮助，主要地自然是蘇聯。誰都知道，日本是蘇聯的共同敵人。爲了蘇聯本身所受的威脅，爲了世界和平興正義，蘇聯必須帮助我們。而且就地理位置，軍略形勢，軍備實力來說，除了英美法之外，也只有蘇聯，才能給予我們眞正有効的帮助。</p>
<p>所以在客觀上我們需耍蘇聯的帮助，是不成問題的，問題都在於蘇聯能不能帮助我們，什麼時候才能帮助我們。我相信現在有許多人都爲了這個問題煩悶着。因爲雖然中蘇兩國已經訂結了一個不侵犯條約，雖然李維諾夫在日內瓦發表了痛詆侵略戰爭的演說，雖然莫斯科已經爲了日本飛機轟炸中國城市提出了抗議，但是除此以外，蘇聯帮助中國抗戰的事實，還沒有具體表現；而莫斯科對中日問題的表面外交行動，也沒有超過倫敦和華盛頓的外交姿勢。（今天報載西伯利亞紅軍移動的消息，是例外）這些事實，卻不免使許多人懷疑苦悶起來。大家都問着；蘇聯到底能不能帮助我們呢？</p>
<p>許多人以爲蘇聯不能帮助我們的原因，第一由於蘇聯國內淸黨肅軍，使蘇聯實力削弱；第二由於蘇聯顧忌日本；第三由於蘇聯顧忌德國；第四由於蘇聯顧忌英國。提出第一種原因的，可以說完全不瞭解蘇聯國情。蘇聯淸黨肅軍的結果，是使紅軍組織更加堅强，對外實力更見增加。第二第三種原因，也不能成立。不錯，蘇聯在東西兩方面，同樣受到侵略的威脅。可是自從二次五年計畫成功之後，西伯利亞與白俄羅斯，鳥克蘭，防禦工臣，已堅固得和鈾牆鐵壁一樣，紅軍紀律和設備，也遠在一般想像之上。蘇聯國防是以東西邊境獨立配置的。換句話說，西境駐軍配備以德國波蘭爲假想敵，西伯利亞駐軍配備，以日本爲假想敵，足以分頭應付而有餘。所以蘇聯不但不畏懼對日作戰，卽使在東西兩方邊境，同時對德日兩國作戰，也有絕對的勝利把握。</p>
<p>至於說到蘇聯因顧忌英國，所以不能帮助我們，這也許近於事實。因爲英國對於參加歐洲法蘇陣綫和德意陳綫始終舉棋不定。假如英國不能提出保障，在德日進攻蘇聯時，决不帮助侵略國，那麼蘇聯能否冒險帮助中國，因而引起德意英日的聯合進攻，這誠然是值得考慮的。</p>
<p>直到目前爲止，英國保守黨內閣對於西歐和遠東和平陣綫和侵略陣綫的對立，依然沒有採取確定的態度，這可以說是使蘇聯對於遠東事變暫時緘默的唯一理由。但是這不過就目前的形勢來說。假如中國外交能採取更堅决的步驟，一面與日本絕交，一面拉攏蘇聯和美國，在那時，英國就不能再行模稜兩可，牠耍更堅决地來反對日本侵略中國。因爲英國是斷不能因爲討好日本而和中蘇美三國爲敵的。現在有好多人對於美國，抱悲觀態度。我却相信美國地位，和蘇聯差不多。美國所顧慮的也是英國。只要我們能夠在外交上表示堅决的反日立塲，美蘇兩國的態度，都會變更，共同壓迫英國，反對日本，而目前外交的僵局，也就打破了。</p>
<p>我們不必隱瞞，我們的抗戰决心，在外交行動上，似乎表現的太不夠。在軍事上我們已經有焦土抗戰的事實，在外交上我們却還沒有遮斷與日本妥洽的道路·我們至今並沒有和敵國斷絕邦交，而且在日內瓦也沒有堅决要求對日實施軍事經濟制裁·這顯然由於英國紳士外交的牽制，使抗日外交不能貫澈到底，在事實上雖然可以原諒。但是中蘇兩國關係，不能迅速進展，主要的原因，也就在這裏。</p>
<p>所以說到最後，蘇聯能不能帮助我們，這問題的解答，還耍靠我們自己。只耍我們自己能夠削減一切茍安的心理，無聊的幻想，向全世界堂堂正正表示抗日到底的决心，不但蘇聯能夠帮助我們，全世界愛和平正義的人士，也全耍站在我們這一邊。</p>

<p>英國著名金融家貝萊爵士。以中國各城邑平民。爲日本炸彈所轟擊。以致殘廢者。不下萬餘人。亟待振救。特捐金一千鎊。以作先導。又英國佈道聯合會。以及英國紅十字會等團體。亦出發呼籲。徵集捐款。以作救濟中國傷病軍民。友邦人士。對於我國同胞。如此熱忱贊助。慷慨輸將。至堪欽佩。至堪感謝。</p>
<p>但是反觀我國。擁有數千萬。或數百萬家勢者。亦大有人在。其平日錦衣肉食。養尊處優。自誇豪闊者。歷歷在目也。而此次為國殺敵之忠勇將士。以及無辜被炸之殘廢良民。傷病者不及醫治。饑寒者無從衣食。此種情形。業已舉目皆是。而尋遍國中欲如貝萊爵士其人者。渺不可得。卽有一二為國毀家之大善士。而考其家勢。並未如舉世矚目之所謂豪華氏族者流。僅僅小資產或中資產階級而已。而舉世矚目之所謂豪華氏族者流。反寂寂無聞。誠足異也。是豈國人愛同胞之心理。反不如友邦人士愛我之心理耶。抑一般殘廢之忠勇將士與無辜良民不易得到豪華者之同情心耶。抑其血至冷而無動於中耶。</p>

<h3>犧牲是我的志願</h3>
<p>— 佘孟耀</p>
<p>為了要健全“上海市童子軍戰時服務團”的組織，辦理第二次的重新登記，因為第一次所登記的表格，填得不大詳細，而且有許多團員，因職務關係，把臂章遺失了。為防止意外起見，因此决定辦理第二次的重新登記。登記的表格有三張，（一）入團表，（二）志愿書，（三）家長允許書。</p>
<p>因為要甄別各童子軍的能力和所受童子軍訓練的學識，當每一個童子軍來交登記表的時候，必須加以試騐，藉此知道他的個性能力學識禮節及其他，自二十五日起開始。</p>
<p>交表格受口試的時候，是很有秩序的，因為事先是着傳令先去通知駐在各處服務塲所的童子軍，規定在第幾日來團應試，這樣一批一批的，挨好號碼個別試騐，自然不會顯得忙亂或擁擠了，試騐的日期有五天。</p>
<p>主考者有三位，一位是團務委員會主席委員冷雪樵先生，可是他公事很忙，所以並不常來。一位是有着嚴肅而爽直的臉，牛山濯濯的實行新生活運動最努力者，他就是指揮處處長沈愚先生。另一位是有着堅實皮膚的靑年胖子，有一副莊嚴而又和善的臉蛋兒，因為忙碌的緣故，顯得非常迫切的神情，一面在詢問考試，一面又要忙着聽電話寫公事，胖臉蛋兒像蘋果色地白裏透紅，顯然是一位能者多勞的人，他就是指揮處副處長魏浩源先生。</p>
<p>內勤的童子軍向休息處呌喚號碼，童子軍個別地進入處長室裏去應試，神情顯得非常緊張，而精神都很飽滿，推進門去，就挺有精神地“拍”的一聲立正行了個三指禮，然後筆挺地立正着聽候試騐</p>
<p>“你現在那裏服務？”副處長的手裏按了表格，翻看了一會，開始詢問起來。</p>
<p>“在××收容所，”童子軍立正着回答。</p>
<p>“受過童子軍何級課程？”第二句就接了問下去，</p>
<p>“中級課程，但是沒有完畢，”情緒顯得有些緊張起來，</p>
<p>“童子軍的誓詞第二條怎麼說？”</p>
<p>“隨時隨地扶助他人，服務公衆。”</p>
<p>“規律第七條是什麼？”</p>
<p>“—是禮節，呵！不對，記錯了，是一誠實，二忠孝，三助人，四仁愛，五禮節，六公平，七服從，是服從！”因了一時間記憶的錯誤，脫口說錯了，就立刻從頭默背着到第七條，才大聲地說是服從，樣子有些慌張了。</p>
<p>“方位有幾個？”</p>
<p>“十六個，”</p>
<p>“魏先生電話！”旁邊一個人說，於是“喂，是的，哦，唉，呵，”一陣聽好了電語，又問了下去</p>
<p>“電碼旗話的‘六一字怎樣打法？’眼睛望着童子軍，童子軍就左足分開，兩手平擧着，表示打旗語的姿勢。</p>
<p>“搬運傷人有幾種方法？”</p>
<p>“這個，這個救護還沒有訓練到！”態度有些侷促？</p>
<p>“要是我們去隨軍服務，離開上海，你去不去？”</p>
<p>“去！我去的！”聲音又響亮起來。</p>
<p>“隨軍服務是很危險的！你害怕嗎？”</p>
<p>“不怕！就是犧牲掉也是我的志願！”强有力的語調，主考者被感動了</p>
<p>“很好！你很有志氣，這張隨軍服務志願書，你拿去填了後交來。”</p>
<p>“是！”雙手接了志願書，行了個三指禮，於是向後轉走了出來，臉上的表情是顯着微笑，似乎很興奮。</p>
<p>“六四二號”！值內勤的童子軍又在休息處里呌喚了，立刻有一個童子軍站了起來去，推處長室的門走了進去。</p>
<h3>腥風</h3>
<p>— □狷</p>
<p>大華烈士簡又文先生，每作隨筆雜感之類，往往因地域的區別，而以“東南風”“西北風”等為其標題，信手拈來，不失風人之旨。聞自我國全面抗戰發動以來，無論東風·西風·南風·北風中，全都充滿着血腥氣；因名我篇曰“腥風”。</p>
<p>我軍的淞滬新陣綫，雖天天遭受敵軍最猛烈的砲火炸彈不斷地轟擊，步兵騎兵和坦克車不斷地進攻；卻好似銅牆鐵壁一般，還是屹然未動，比了我們舊的萬里長城，堅固百倍，這眞如義勇軍進行曲中所謂把我們的血肉，築成我們新的長城了。</p>
<p>處治那萬惡的漢奸，最好是沿用舊律滿門抄斬；那麼家人骨肉之間，為了怕被株連起見，平日就得互相監視，大家不敢再做漢奸。要是就罪不及孥，滿門抄斬辦不到，我以為對於漢奸本身，也非斬首不可。不見德國處治賣國賊，近年來都用斬首之刑，雖婦女不能例外。所以呌窮兇極惡的漢奸身首異處。不能說是殘酷。槍斃，不但太便宜了漢奸，實在也太不經濟；省下每一顆子彈來，至少可以打死一個侵略我們的敵人。</p>
<p>上海日暉港遭敵機轟炸時，又炸死了我們許多無辜的平民。內中有一個孕婦，給彈片洞穿了肚子，那胎兒的小手，竟伸出肚外，一會兒自行產出，可是那小生命也已不保了。大家試閉上眼睛想一想，這是何等慘痛的情景！唉！可惜這孩子已死了；他要是活着的話，我願意牽着他那雙小手，踏進這血腥氣的世界，放在後方安全地帶，好好地撫育他起來，自幼兒就給他受那空軍的敎育，并時時使他看着他母親的遺影，朝夕加以激勵，把他造就一個勇猛無比的空軍戰士。到得一朝學成之後，就由他帶領着大隊空軍，渡海而東，投下千百個大炸彈去，把那扶桑二島，轟成一片白地。呵呵！這是多麼痛快的報復！</p>
<p>黃秋岳（濬）以名詩人浮沈宦海，聲華藉甚，不幸為物慾所蔽，喪心病狂，竟和他的兒子狼狽為奸，做起賣祖國賣同胞的大漢奸來。終於東窗事發，身罹極刑，只落得遺臭萬年；地下若逢陳石遺陳散原二詩老，（按二詩老新歿，均與黃有舊。）有何面目？恐二老見了他，也將不顧而唾，而有卿本佳人，奈何作賊之歎咧。</p>

<h3>Heavy Fighting Erupts at Shenjiawan; Enemy Forces in Downtown Area Transferred to Liuhang</h3>
<p>Our Frontline Troops Replenished and Well-Prepared for a Decisive Blow. Enemy Forces Attacked Zhabei Yesterday Morning but Were Repelled. Dachang, Pudong, and the South City Were Bombed by Enemy Aircraft Yesterday.</p>
<p>As enemy forces are launching an all-out general offensive, the enemy in areas such as downtown, Jiangwan, and Hongkou suddenly retreated at 5:00 AM one morning. The news spread quickly, causing both surprise and joy, and people speculated about the reasons. Some suggested that internal conflicts among young soldiers and the puppet Manchukuo, Korean, and Taiwanese troops hindered military operations. However, according to reliable sources, the withdrawal was indeed due to their inability to break through our defense lines in the aforementioned areas. Consequently, they redeployed those forces to concentrate on Liuhang for a general offensive against us. Currently, within a three-kilometer area northwest of Qimei Road, south of Sanmin Road, and west of Lujiajiao in the downtown area, there is no trace of the enemy. However, the enemy north of Sanmin Road, around Tianlu Temple, remains entrenched. In recent days, the enemy has launched a full-scale attack on our line from Luodian to Liuhang, but they have been severely defeated by us and have suffered heavy losses. At Taiping Bridge, north of Liuhang, fierce battles have been fought to the death for the past two days, with gains and losses alternating repeatedly. Despite the enemy's heavy artillery fire, our troops' morale is high, and they are fighting valiantly, eventually repelling the enemy and recovering our original positions. At Shenjiawan, about one kilometer west of Luodian, an unprecedented bloody battle has erupted. At the time of this report, fierce fighting was still ongoing. Our troops are relying on solid fortifications and launching courageous attacks, ensuring no errors. Around Liuhang, the enemy concentrated artillery fire, bombarding our positions heavily. Although our fortifications suffered some damage, they have now been reinforced and are well-prepared. We are absolutely confident in both offense and defense. Yesterday, the enemy dared not attack again, and the fighting became relatively quiet. In Zhabei, the enemy launched an attack the previous night, but after being severely defeated by us, their momentum subsided. According to our senior commander, our frontline troops have been replenished and are ready, with sufficient strength and solid defenses. The soldiers at the front are determined to fight to the end and are very confident in a protracted war. The final victory will surely be ours, he said.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting at Shenjiawan Continues; Tranquility Returns to Liuhang Town</h3>
<p>Enemy's Attack on Shi Xiang Gong Temple Repelled with Heavy Losses. Taiping Bridge Recaptured After Two Days of Intense Fighting. We Fortify Our Positions in Liuhang Town.</p>
<p>A report from the Central News Agency's war correspondent at 8:00 PM on the 2nd states that the enemy's fourth general offensive concentrated its firepower on the Luodian to Liuhang area, launching a fierce attack. After three days of intense fighting, only at Shenjiawan, about one kilometer west of Luodian, the enemy continued to harass us, and fierce fighting was still ongoing. As of the time of the report, the situation was still at a stalemate. The enemy attacking Shi Xiang Gong Temple was met with a head-on attack by our troops, suffering heavy losses and不敢再來 (lit. "daring not come again"). At Taiping Bridge, north of Liuhang, both sides fought to the death for the past two days, with gains and losses alternating several times. Finally, our troops recaptured and firmly defended it. On the front of Liuhang Town, the enemy launched several attacks but failed to succeed. However, our fortifications suffered some damage due to the enemy's heavy bombardment. We are currently reinforcing them along the west side of Hutai Road, and we are fully confident in both offense and defense. The fighting in this area became relatively quiet today. Twelve enemy aircraft took off at dawn and circled over the entire line several times, then dropped many bombs on our positions at Dachang, causing no losses. The enemy west of the downtown area moved backward. It is learned that within an area of about three kilometers northwest of Qimei Road, south of Sanmin Road, and west of Lujiajiao, there is no trace of the enemy. However, the enemy north of Sanmin Road, around Tianlu Temple, remains entrenched. The purpose of the enemy's movement in this area seems to be to concentrate its forces and attempt to break through towards Liuhang.</p>
<h3>A Commander-in-Chief: Luodian and Liuhang Remain Immovable</h3>
<p>Frontline Replenishments Completed; Strength Unparalleled; All Determined to Fight to the Death; Final Victory Will Surely Be Ours.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter visited a certain commander-in-chief at the frontline headquarters on the 1st. According to him, although the fighting along the Luodian-Liuhang line is intense, our positions remain unmoved. Although we have not yet ordered a counteroffensive to drive the enemy out of our territory, the enemy cannot advance an inch further. We are already assured of victory in a protracted war. Our forces in the north suffered a slight setback last week, but fresh troops have been dispatched for a counteroffensive. These temporary advances and retreats will not affect the overall situation. As for the losses of our frontline divisions since the start of the Shanghai campaign, they have now been replenished, and their strength remains unparalleled. The enemy's withdrawal from the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas on the 30th can be attributed to two reasons: internal conflicts among young soldiers and puppet Manchukuo, Korean, and Taiwanese troops, or the enemy's transfer of forces to other areas. The commander-in-chief also spoke generally about the enemy's repeated general offensives in Shanghai, which have resulted in repeated defeats. This is an undeniable fact. The enemy's strength has been greatly depleted, and their soldiers are demoralized. Our frontline officers and soldiers are all determined to fight to the death, using their iron and blood heads to defend our beautiful land. Thousands of soldiers have sacrificed their lives for the country without a word of complaint. This is because our entire army believes that this war is not only to fight for the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation, but also to seek peace and justice for all mankind. The heroic sacrifices of our Yao Battalion in Baoshan and Luo Regiment in Nankou are earth-shattering and tear-inducing. Without this belief, we could not have this spirit, which surpasses the spirit of resistance of all other nations in the world. Finally, the reporter asked that, based on the above, our overall protracted war, the final victory will surely be ours. The commander-in-chief immediately replied with a firm tone, "This is inevitable and without a doubt." He also presented the reporter with the words of the national hero Shi Dakai: "How can we bear to see the garments of a great nation fall into the hands of barbarians? Let us lead the heroes of the Central Plains to restore our rivers and mountains!" This shows the commander-in-chief's loyal and patriotic heart.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Attacks Enemy Positions at Night</h3>
<p>At 9:35 PM last night, our air force flew to Shanghai again for a night raid. When our planes flew over the enemy warships in the Huangpu River, they hastily turned on searchlights and fired anti-aircraft guns and machine guns in response. Our planes flew safely over them and dropped several bombs on enemy positions in the Yangshupu area. After about a quarter of an hour, all planes returned safely.</p>
<h3>Large Group of Enemy Aircraft Bombs Dachang</h3>
<p>At noon yesterday, a squadron of enemy aircraft flew to Liuhe for bombing. The artillery fire there was fierce, and the enemy tried to break through our positions, but failed. Also, between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM yesterday, a squadron of about twelve to fifteen enemy aircraft dropped more than sixty bombs in the Dachang and Hutai Road area. Three of the aircraft were particularly large military monoplanes.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb Nanxiang and Jiading</h3>
<p>Around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, eight enemy aircraft flew to the Nanxiang town area for reconnaissance. They took turns dropping bombs near the Nanxiang Xihu Bus Station, totaling more than twenty bombs. The Nanxiang Xihu Bus Station was immediately destroyed, and more than forty civilians in the vicinity were also tragically killed.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Suzhou, 2nd: Enemy aircraft bombed Jiading on the 1st, dropping more than ten bombs and killing or wounding more than a hundred civilians.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Ravage South City and Pudong</h3>
<p>A squadron of enemy aircraft continuously bombed our Bailianjing area in Pudong from 2:30 PM to after 4:00 PM yesterday. Because the enemy had no specific target, our losses were minimal. Also, around 5:00 PM yesterday, a squadron of enemy aircraft suddenly flew over the Fenglin Bridge, a non-combat zone, seemingly attempting to bomb our municipal government offices. They dropped several bombs, but fortunately, they all fell in the fields. Although there were no losses from the explosions, the enemy aircraft strafed downwards with machine guns, resulting in the death and injury of more than ten innocent civilians.</p>
<p>Two enemy aircraft flew to the west of the Qinci Yangdian in Pudong around 8:00 AM yesterday and dropped four bombs. Two bombs exploded, injuring one farmer and one boy. At 3:00 PM, another plane came and strafed pedestrians with machine guns in the Yangjiazhai area, but fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries.</p>
<p>From 4:30 PM to 4:45 PM yesterday, three enemy aircraft dropped four bombs near Beixinjing, destroying several thatched houses and sinking three civilian boats on the river, killing three people and injuring nine.</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM yesterday, two enemy aircraft circled and dropped bombs in the Pudong area, then flew to the front of the Nine Mu Di Tofu Shop, about a hundred paces from the French Concession's Xinqiao Street, and dropped a hundred-pound bomb. Fortunately, it did not explode. At that time, it was the time when the open-air vegetable market was open, otherwise the consequences would have been unimaginable. This was the first bomb in the city since the start of the war. It is said that the police later carried the bomb away.</p>
<p>At 5:01 PM yesterday, enemy aircraft were suddenly spotted flying low in the sky over the triangular area of Xieshi Road, using machine guns to strafe. At that time, a villager was seriously injured. It is said that the area is near the astronomical observatory, and since the start of the war, no enemy aircraft have flown over or reconnoitered there, nor are there any military facilities or troops stationed there. The people are extremely panicked by the enemy aircraft's reconnaissance there yesterday.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Retreat from Hongkou Downtown Area and Zhang Huabang to Reinforce Liuhang</h3>
<p>We Conduct Two-Pronged Search and Encirclement of the Downtown Area</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Suzhou, 2nd: The enemy in the Hongkou, downtown area, and Zhang Huabang areas has been withdrawing successively since the 1st. Currently, there are only a few enemy soldiers in the vicinity of the downtown area, and the rest have moved north, seemingly to reinforce the Liuhang area. From 2:00 PM on the 1st, there was heavy gunfire in the Hongkou area, which stopped after several hours. It is said that there was an internal conflict among the enemy.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Our agency's war correspondent reported at 10:00 AM on the 2nd that after the enemy forces entrenched in the area west of Songhu Road and Jiangwan Huangxing Road in the downtown area began to retreat eastward, our army specially dispatched elite troops to search forward. The results revealed that the following areas were free of enemy traces: ㊀ The area north of Sanmin Road around Tianlu Temple. ㊁ The area southeast of Fudan University, including Zhangjiaxiang, Xitangwan, Jinjiaxiang Qiujiazhai, and Dijiabang, where the enemy retreated one thousand meters. ㊂ The enemy east of Qimei Road and west of Yinjiazhai and Wujiazhai completely withdrew. ㊃ The enemy south of Xiangyin Road, near the East-West Sports Association Road, also retreated south and concentrated on Jiangwan Road. ㊄ This morning, the enemy transported a large number of landmines to the downtown area, presumably to bury them there to prevent us from occupying it.</p>
<p>After the enemy west of the downtown area moved eastward, our army has now dispatched elite troops, divided into groups advancing along Sanmin Road and Xiangyin Road, setting up alert positions along the way in order to encircle the downtown area. Another unit left Hejiaxiang and went to Sijing Field to attack the enemy. As of 11:00 AM, no enemy traces were seen, so no contact was made.</p>
<p>The river between the Jiangwan area's Municipal First Public Cemetery and Tangjiazhai suddenly dried up. Our army discovered that the enemy had blocked the river mouth, presumably to use the riverbed for tank traffic.</p>
<p>A large group of enemy troops has gathered in the Zhangjiazhai and Luqiaozhai area on the border of the Jiangwan area south of Yunzaobang, but there has been no action yet.</p>
<p>At 4:30 PM yesterday, three enemy aircraft took off from the enemy's temporary airfield at the end of Yangshupu Road. After circling several times in the Zhabei area, they flew west to the Xinjing area in northwest Shanghai and dropped seven bombs near the Zhenbei Bridge in Puzong Town, killing three civilians, injuring nine, and sinking three ferries. Around 5:00 PM, another enemy aircraft reconnoitered at low altitude in the Tushanwan Catholic Church Huinan Street area southwest of Xujiahui, and from time to time used machine guns to strafe. It flew away after about half an hour. The casualties are still being investigated.</p>
<h3>Enemy Announces Number of Casualties</h3>
<p>The enemy spokesperson announced that from August 23rd to September 27th, the total number of deaths and injuries in Shanghai reached 7,530, including 1,893 deaths and 5,637 injuries. This number is higher than the previous announcement. However, the enemy has always been secretive about the actual number of deaths and injuries, and the marine corps is not included in the calculation. Therefore, it is estimated that the total number of deaths and injuries is about 20,000 or more.</p>
<h3>Enemy Arrives with Another 2,000 Cavalry Troops</h3>
<p>The enemy's fourth reinforcement army, consisting of one division and one brigade, totaling more than 40,000 men, has been arriving in Shanghai successively over the past ten days. The enemy also began its fourth general offensive on the 28th of last month. However, because our positions are solid and our morale is high, and because the enemy has been severely defeated by our army since the attack, the enemy's casualties have suddenly increased. Now, in order to achieve its goal of a quick victory, the enemy has decided to continue sending an elite division to Shanghai. The first batch, about 2,000 cavalry troops, arrived in Shanghai at dawn yesterday aboard four transport ships converted from enemy merchant ships: No. 158 Yukimaru, No. 260 Pacific Maru, No. 324 Kinryu Maru, and No. 282 Meiko Maru. They landed at the Huangpu, Osaka, and Huishan wharves, and at the same time, a large number of warhorses were unloaded.</p>
<p>Also yesterday (2nd) morning, two more enemy transport ships converted from enemy merchant ships, No. 91 Haguro Maru and Nagasaki Maru, arrived in Shanghai and docked at the Huishan wharf. A large number of enemy military vehicles, tanks, and over a thousand boxes of military supplies were unloaded and brought ashore.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle in Zhabei All Night; Our Mechanized Units Annihilate the Enemy</h3>
<p>Enemy Uses Tanks to Shield Infantry Charge. Our Army Envelops and Annihilates Over 200 Enemies, and Kills 4 Enemy Platoon Leaders.</p>
<p>From the night before last until yesterday morning (2nd), a fierce battle occurred in the Zhabei area. Around 9:00 PM the night before last, enemy tanks shielded infantry, divided into groups to probe westward from North Sichuan Road, and attacked our positions in the area of Shiqing Road intersection, Dongbaoxing Road intersection, Qiujiang Road intersection, and Zhongzhou Road intersection. The number of troops was about one regiment, swarming in, especially at the Baoxing Road and Qiujiang Road intersections. Our army also used mechanized units to attack the enemy's tanks and shielded infantry to counterattack. The fighting was fierce. Our army bravely charged in, and after several hours of fierce fighting, cut off the enemy's communication, heavily encircled them, and annihilated them. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in this battle. Over 120 enemies were killed in the Baoxing Road area, over 90 enemies were killed in the Qiujiang Road area, and another one or twenty enemies were killed in other areas. One enemy company commander and three platoon leaders were also killed. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the remnants of the enemy were defeated in a rout. Our army charged straight to the vicinity of the Yongfeng Building on North Sichuan Road, and also captured a White Russian spy in the Zhongzhou Road area, who is currently being detained for interrogation.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday, four enemy tanks attempted to attack our positions on Baoshan Road, but were bravely intercepted by our army, and the enemy was unable to continue advancing. The stalemate continued until noon, with no result, and then they retreated.</p>
<p>Repeated Attacks Ultimately Fail</p>
<p>From 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM yesterday, the fighting was intense in the Zhabei Baoshan Road, Yongxing Road, Binchang Road, Zhongyang Road, and Baziqiao areas, with the sound of artillery fire booming. After 9:00 AM, there was also the sound of artillery fire near the Bazilu Hescool Road, which did not stop until noon. Our army used heavy artillery to bombard Baoluan Road, North Sichuan Road, Qiujiang Road, Wusong Road, and Baibao Road. Binshan Road, Binchang Road, Zhonghua Xin Road, and other places were bombed by enemy aircraft. Also, it was reported that from around 3:00 PM yesterday, small squads of enemy infantry at the end of Zhabei Baziqiao, Liu San Garden, Jiangwan Road, and North Sichuan Road launched fierce charges against our positions, using small mortars and machine guns to bombard and sweep. Our army waited for the enemy to charge to within 30 meters before suddenly jumping out of the trenches and launching a head-on attack. The enemy repeatedly fell and rose again, suffering heavy casualties. By evening, there were more than ten close-quarters combat encounters, all of which were repelled by our army with machine guns and other weapons.</p>
<p>Zhabei Civilian Houses Reduced to Scorched Earth</p>
<p>The Binshan Road area of Zhabei was bombed by enemy artillery fire from the Yangshupu area all day yesterday, and was also bombed by enemy aircraft, causing more than ten fires in the area, each destroying one or two or three or five houses. They started and stopped, changing constantly. However, at around 2:00 PM, the civilian houses south of the library across from the Commercial Press factory were hit by a heavy bomb dropped by an enemy aircraft, which immediately caught fire, with dense smoke billowing out. Before long, the flames were blazing and spreading rapidly. Because the area was right on the fire line, fire trucks could not go to the rescue, so the fire had not been extinguished by evening. In addition, due to continuous bombing by enemy aircraft, all the city houses in that section, about half a li from Shuiting South to Binyuan Road, were burned down and turned into scorched earth.</p>
<h3>Enemy Convenes Military Conference</h3>
<p>Decides on Important Strategic General Offensive</p>
<p>Central News Agency: According to reliable sources, enemy senior generals held an important military conference at the Japanese Telecommunications Bureau at the intersection of Tianzhai Road and Xihuade Road at 1:00 PM on the 30th of last month. Those present included enemy army and air force commander-in-chief Matsui, division commander Itagaki, 3rd Fleet commander Hasegawa, special marine corps commander Okawauchi, 3rd Fleet chief of staff Sugiyama Genzo, and more than ten others. According to inquiries from various sources, the discussion focused on deciding the important strategy for this general offensive, and the reason why the enemy forces in the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas retreated in stages from 5:00 PM on the 30th was the first step of the important strategy decided by the enemy at this conference.</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency: According to reliable sources, from 7:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy's highest military officers held a military conference at the Japanese Consulate on the Bund. At one point, there were as many as twenty or thirty black-plated cars parked near the consulate. It is estimated that there were at least twenty people participating. At the same time, two speedboats traveled back and forth between the "Izumo" warship and the Japanese Consulate, carrying officials to attend. The meeting did not end until after 11:00 AM. According to information from the Japanese side, the meeting held by the enemy yesterday morning was to discuss the final operational steps for the Shanghai war in the future, so it was very important in nature. 3rd Fleet Commander Hasegawa, "Izumo" warship Captain Iwamura, Army and Air Force Commander-in-Chief Matsui, naval attaché Takeda, chief of staff Oda Yayoi, and others all personally participated in the discussions. It is also learned that after this meeting, Matsui and Hasegawa will sign their names and send a telegram to the army and navy ministries of their country for instructions, and then proceed with everything. Therefore, there will be major new developments in the Shanghai war within the next day or two.</p>
<h3>Northern Shanxi Our Army's Second Attack; Suzuki Brigade Largely Annihilated</h3>
<p>Our Forces Retreat to the Yanmen Pass Area Due to Protruding Positions. Guerrilla Units Extremely Active in Lingqiu, Guangling, etc.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Military Information: After the enemy attacking Pingxingguan on the 23rd of last month was defeated by our heavy attack, they later reinforced their troops and attacked again. After a day of fierce fighting, many enemies were killed. Then, at dawn on the 25th, our Guo Division launched a second attack and coordinated with friendly forces to advance on the enemy's flanks, cutting off their retreat route and largely annihilating the enemy Suzuki Brigade, capturing more than fifty vehicles and countless military supplies. On the 26th, the remaining enemy troops were reinforced by a large number of troops and attacked us. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, more than a thousand enemies were killed. However, because the positions there were too protruding and were attacked on three sides, our forces withdrew to the mountainous areas around Yanmen Pass, Daixian, E'kou, and Wutai Mountain on the night of the 28th, forming a hook shape on the right wing of the positions (Central News Agency report on the 2nd).</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] A certain unit of our troops in northern Shanxi, good at guerrilla warfare, has arrived at the front lines to fight. The enemy has suffered heavy losses in recent days. It is heard that the enemy troops invading westward are afraid of their rear being cut off and are preparing to retreat. Guerrilla units are extremely active in Lingqiu, Guangling, etc., attacking day and night, making it extremely difficult for the enemy to resupply and transport (Central News Agency report on the 2nd).</p>
<h3>Military Expert Talks About How the Enemy's Invasion of Shanxi Will Inevitably Be Ambushed By Our Forces</h3>
<p>Our Forces are Distributed in the Taihang and Luliang Mountains and Can Be Dispatched at Any Time</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The war in northern Shanxi has been extremely tense in recent days. A reporter specially went to consult a military expert about the trend. According to him, since Datong was captured, the enemy's invasion routes are two: one is westward invasion, and the other is southward invasion. When the enemy moved its main force south of Datong, its intentions gradually became clear. After the Battle of Pingxingguan, the enemy suffered heavy blows, but still did not forget its urgency to invade Shanxi, which became even more obvious. However, Shanxi Province has always had the key passes of Yanmen, Pingxing, and Niangzi. The enemy will inevitably suffer heavy blows if it wants to break through. Even if the enemy is lucky enough to break through one or two passes, it is no different from throwing itself into a trap, because the entire territory of Shanxi Province is mountainous, a plateau. The steepness of the Taihang and Luliang Mountains is even greater than that of the passes. Even if the enemy can break through the passes, it will never be able to break through the mountainous dangers. The Taihang and Luliang Mountains control both banks of the Fen River. Judging from the enemy's usual reliance on motorized marches, if the southward invasion is successful, it must go straight down both banks of the Fen River. If our forces can be distributed in the Taihang and Luliang Mountains, they can be dispatched at any time to ambush, which will be very effective. Therefore, the future of the military situation in Shanxi Province can be viewed with optimism. In addition, our forces in the Taihang Mountains can also go east to attack the enemy invading south along the Pinghan Road, and provide the enemy with containment south of the Jinpu Road. It is hoped that the authorities will make full use of the dangers of the two mountains in Shanxi Province to be able to fight a long-term war and achieve final victory (Central News Agency report on the 2nd).</p>
<h3>British Labour Party Leader Clynes on Economic Boycott Against Japan</h3>
<p>Transport Workers' Federation Takes Direct Action to Make the Japanese Aware of Global Anger</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that Mr. Clynes, the leader of the British Labour Party and a hopeful candidate for the Luton constituency in the House of Commons, recently represented the Labour Party on a fact-finding mission to the Far East, with a particular focus on the Sino-Japanese dispute. He arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from the Continental Daily News visited him at his hotel to inquire about the British boycott of Japanese goods and other issues. Mr. Clynes stated, "I can absolutely assure you that the entire British Labour Party and the trade unions will unite to assist the Chinese people and agree on an effective plan to implement an economic boycott against Japan. I have no doubt about this. The British Labour Party is scheduled to hold a meeting in London on October 5th, and it will definitely approve the economic boycott. Chinese trade unions have already jointly sent a telegram to a representative from China, along with their government, to participate in this important meeting. Once the conference approves the boycott procedures, the entire British population will undoubtedly respond. The British Labour Party and trade union representatives have organized labor, totaling five million people, and their impact can be imagined." The reporter asked if British employers refused to participate in the boycott movement, would the conference advocate a strike to deal with it? Mr. Clynes replied, "I believe the International Transport Workers' Federation will take direct action, refusing to load or unload Japanese goods from ships. British transport workers are also part of this federation." The reporter further asked, "According to reports from London, the British government does not seem to support the implementation of an economic boycott against Japan. What is your opinion on this, sir?" Mr. Clynes responded, "I believe the attitude conveyed by the telegrams regarding the British government should not be taken at face value. British rulers are very clever, and the reported government opposition to the boycott plan may be the opposite of what the telegrams state." Mr. Clynes also said, "News reports from Australia, New Zealand, and India have clearly revealed the leaning of public opinion in the British dominions. I am convinced that the boycott movement against Japan is spreading like wildfire in the United States." At the beginning of the interview with Mr. Clynes, the reporter asked for his personal opinion on the commercial boycott movement. Mr. Clynes said, "I believe this kind of boycott is one of the most effective ways to make the Japanese people aware of the global anger at the cruel methods used by the Japanese army and navy to harm innocent civilians in China. I believe this method is even more important now because the Japanese public is being misled by their authorities about the war in China. Japanese newspapers are currently subject to strict censorship, and the general public knows almost nothing about the truth of the situation in China. When I was in Japan recently, I heard that the shortwave radios owned by Japanese civilians had all been confiscated by the police. Even the radios owned by foreign consular officials had been sealed by the Japanese authorities, preventing their use. In short, economic events can often determine the policies of individuals and nations. Commercial losses are the most effective way to awaken the Japanese people." He added, "In my personal opinion, I believe that the general Japanese population does not approve of some of the actions taken by their army and navy authorities in China in the name of Japan." Mr. Clynes concluded by saying, "I have received a friendly application to the British Labour Party conference, and I have already telegraphed the entire document to my party."</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Can the Soviet Union Help Us?</h3>
<p>— Hu Yuzhi</p>
<p>Can the Soviet Union help us? To answer this question, we must first ask ourselves: Do we need the Soviet Union's help?</p>
<p>Subjectively speaking, we are striving for self-reliance and fighting to the end, and we believe that we can achieve final victory without relying on any external forces. Therefore, we do not need any other country's help, and therefore, we do not need the Soviet Union's help either.</p>
<p>However, objectively speaking, we understand that we are not only fighting for our own independence and freedom but also for the common interests of the Far Eastern countries threatened by Japanese aggression, and for world peace and justice. Therefore, we cannot refuse the help of any friendly country, whether for their own interests or for peace and justice, who is willing to help us and oppose the Japanese war of aggression, and we also desperately need it. If the assistance of friendly countries can enable China's war of resistance to achieve victory one day earlier, and can enable the Japanese aggressors to be defeated one day earlier, why would we not want the help of friendly countries?</p>
<p>However, we cannot expect all friendly countries to give us effective assistance. Some countries have allied relations with our enemies, so we cannot hope to get real help. Some countries, although willing to help us, are either too far away geographically, so that they do not feel our pain, or they value their own interests too much and are unwilling to take risks lightly, or their strength is not sufficient. We cannot hope to get really effective help from these countries. Naturally, the sympathy of the people of all countries for the Chinese nation's war of resistance is completely unanimous. However, relying solely on these moral sympathies will never satisfy us.</p>
<p>Therefore, the help we can hope to receive is mainly from the Soviet Union. Everyone knows that Japan is the common enemy of the Soviet Union. For the sake of the threat to the Soviet Union itself, and for world peace and justice, the Soviet Union must help us. Moreover, in terms of geographical location, military strategy, and military strength, only the Soviet Union, in addition to Britain, the United States, and France, can give us truly effective help.</p>
<p>Therefore, objectively speaking, our need for the Soviet Union's help is not a problem. The problem lies in whether the Soviet Union can help us and when it can help us. I believe that many people are troubled by this question now. Because although China and the Soviet Union have already signed a non-aggression treaty, although Litvinov delivered a speech in Geneva denouncing wars of aggression, and although Moscow has protested against the bombing of Chinese cities by Japanese aircraft, apart from this, the facts of Soviet aid to China's war of resistance have not yet been concretely demonstrated; and Moscow's superficial diplomatic actions on the Sino-Japanese issue have not exceeded the diplomatic gestures of London and Washington. (Today's news about the movement of the Siberian Red Army is an exception.) These facts cannot help but make many people doubt and feel distressed. Everyone is asking: Can the Soviet Union really help us?</p>
<p>Many people believe that the reasons why the Soviet Union cannot help us are: first, the purges and military reorganizations in the Soviet Union have weakened the Soviet Union's strength; second, the Soviet Union is concerned about Japan; third, the Soviet Union is concerned about Germany; and fourth, the Soviet Union is concerned about Britain. Proposing the first reason shows a complete lack of understanding of the Soviet Union's national conditions. The result of the Soviet Union's purges and military reorganizations is that the Red Army organization has become stronger and its external strength has increased. The second and third reasons are also untenable. It is true that the Soviet Union is equally threatened by aggression from both the east and west. However, since the success of the Second Five-Year Plan, the defense works in Siberia, Belarus, Ukraine, have become as solid as copper walls and iron walls, and the discipline and equipment of the Red Army are also far beyond general imagination. Soviet national defense is configured independently on the eastern and western borders. In other words, the Western border garrison is equipped with Germany and Poland as the hypothetical enemies, and the Siberian garrison is equipped with Japan as the hypothetical enemy, which is sufficient to deal with them separately and have surplus capacity. Therefore, the Soviet Union is not only not afraid of fighting Japan, but even if it fights Germany and Japan simultaneously on both the eastern and western borders, it has absolute confidence in victory.</p>
<p>As for saying that the Soviet Union cannot help us because it is concerned about Britain, this may be close to the truth. Because Britain has always hesitated to participate in the European Franco-Soviet front and the German-Italian front. If Britain cannot provide guarantees that it will never help the aggressor countries if Germany and Japan attack the Soviet Union, then whether the Soviet Union can risk helping China, thereby triggering a joint attack by Germany, Italy, Britain, and Japan, is indeed worth considering.</p>
<p>Until now, the British Conservative cabinet has still not adopted a definite attitude towards the opposition between the Western European and Far Eastern peace fronts and the aggression fronts. This can be said to be the only reason for the Soviet Union's temporary silence on the Far Eastern incident. However, this is only in terms of the current situation. If Chinese diplomacy can take more resolute steps, on the one hand, severing relations with Japan, and on the other hand, wooing the Soviet Union and the United States, then Britain can no longer be ambiguous, and it will more resolutely oppose Japan's aggression against China. Because Britain can never make enemies of China, the Soviet Union, and the United States in order to please Japan. Now many people have a pessimistic attitude towards the United States. However, I believe that the United States' position is similar to that of the Soviet Union. What the United States is also worried about is Britain. As long as we can express a resolute anti-Japanese position in diplomacy, the attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union will change, and they will jointly put pressure on Britain to oppose Japan, and the current diplomatic deadlock will be broken.</p>
<p>We do not have to hide that our determination to resist Japan seems to be insufficiently expressed in diplomatic actions. In military terms, we already have the fact of scorched-earth resistance, but in diplomacy, we have not yet blocked the road to reconciliation with Japan. We have not yet severed diplomatic relations with the enemy country, and we have not resolutely demanded military and economic sanctions against Japan in Geneva. This is obviously due to the constraints of British gentleman diplomacy, which prevents anti-Japanese diplomacy from being thoroughly implemented. Although this can be forgiven in fact, the main reason why the relations between China and the Soviet Union cannot develop rapidly lies here.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the final analysis, whether the Soviet Union can help us, the answer to this question depends on ourselves. As long as we ourselves can reduce all thoughts of complacency and useless illusions, and show the world our determination to resist Japan to the end, not only will the Soviet Union be able to help us, but all peace-loving and righteous people in the world will also stand on our side.</p>

<h3>Our Representative Requests the League of Nations to Declare Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>To Clarify Right and Wrong and Maintain the Covenant. Measures to Stop It Can Be Taken Deliberately</p>
<p>[Geneva] Today, the Chinese representative Gu Weijun submitted a resolution to the Twenty-Three Member Advisory Committee of the League of Nations, requesting recognition of Japan's act of aggression. The resolution stated that the Japanese army had invaded Chinese territory, bombarded Chinese commercial ports and cities from both sea and air, refused peaceful negotiations, and violated the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Paris Pact. The resolution has been moved to a subcommittee for research. Before beginning discussions, the subcommittee decided to request the Secretariat to collect all materials from the Japanese side so that its conclusions would not be biased towards one side. When submitting this resolution, Gu Weijun stated that all the points he referred to were well known throughout the world and were facts that had been confirmed by the various actions of the Japanese army on land, the navy along the coast and in the high seas, and the air force in the air. An act of aggression has been committed against China, a member of the League of Nations, which is undeniable and should be brought to the attention of the committee. He also said that the conclusions of the resolution were based on the above facts, were fully justified, and could not be escaped. Therefore, the committee should recognize it with an appropriate announcement. Gu also said, "I am well aware that some people will feel hesitant about this announcement, fearing the possible consequences that may arise. But what we are asking for is not to have countries fulfill their obligations in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant to protect the territorial integrity and political independence of China. Due to past unsatisfactory experiences and facts elsewhere in the world, we have realized that the actions of the League of Nations must be cautious and moderate. However, this consideration only applies to the measures that should be taken to stop the forces of aggression, and there should be no compromise on the issue of reaffirming the principles of the League of Nations. In the current situation, if the League of Nations does not use all its mechanisms to stop aggression, the world can still understand it. But if the League of Nations does not dare to speak out on right and wrong, then the world will have no way to forgive it. If so, the moral standing of the League of Nations will be further weakened." Gu Weimin stated, "Nothing can prevent the League of Nations from arising and declaring its opinions based on the principles of its own existence, and not only China is hoping for this, but the whole world is waiting for it."

<h3>League of Nations Establishes Small Committee to Discuss Our Proposal</h3>
<p>Materials Provided by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. British Representative Does Not Advocate Using the Word "Aggression"</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Issues of the League of Nations General Assembly designated representatives from thirteen countries this morning to form a subcommittee to discuss the dispute between China and Japan, as well as various related issues, including the Commonwealth of Australia, Belgium, Great Britain, China, Ecuador, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, the Soviet Union, New Zealand, Latvia, and the United States.

<p>[Geneva] The subcommittee of the Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Issues held a closed meeting today to discuss the proposal of the British and Australian representatives, that is, to instruct the Secretary-General of the League of Nations to prepare a memorandum explaining the actual situation in the Far East, including information from both China and Japan, from the standpoint of a third party. Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of our country, expressed his opinion, saying that with the facts of the current situation in the Far East in place, and the League of Nations having already resolved to condemn Japan, it cannot adopt the standpoint of a third party again. The spokesman for the British delegation told reporters last night that Sir Cranborne's opinion was roughly the same as the draft resolution submitted by the Chinese delegation. According to reporters who inquired from an important representative of the League of Nations, the discussions of the subcommittee this morning made no progress because certain representatives intended to avoid mentioning the word "aggression" in the draft resolution. The subcommittee is scheduled to meet again tonight. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>United Kingdom Dignitaries Jointly Initiate Fundraising</h3>
<p>Leading Bishops Denounce Japanese Atrocities; Party Leaders Give Speeches to Boycott Japanese Goods</p>
<p>[London] The British Red Cross Society, the China Association, and various British churches recently jointly appealed to the British public for donations to assist China in medical care and to aid injured Chinese civilians and those made homeless by the war. It is expected that the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Harry Brittain, will formally endorse the fundraising campaign. Once a sufficient amount of donations and needed supplies are collected, they will be sent to China. (Central News Agency dispatch from Havas on the 1st)</p>
<p>[London] Among the signatories of this appeal are some of the most influential figures in Britain, such as the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of Westminster, the Archbishop of York, the Lord Mayor of London, the Moderator of the Church of Scotland, leading figures of major Free Churches, the Chief Rabbi, the former Governor-General of Canada and India, Lord Willingdon, the Chairman of Hill Transport &amp; Trading, Lord Polwarth, Lord Samuel, the Chairman of ICI, Lord McGowan, Lord Riverdale, the renowned financier Sir Robert Kindersley, the Director of P&amp;O, Sir Alan Anderson, the Chairman of British American Tobacco, Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen, the former Chairman of the China Association, Sir John Macleavy Brown, the Chairman of the China Section of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, Sir Stewart Ashton, the Director of the School of Oriental Studies at the London Institution, Sir E. Denison Ross, and Conservative Member of Parliament, Mr. Patrick Hannon, and many others. The appeal is based on "broad humanitarianism, as the Sino-Japanese War has caused countless Chinese people to suffer all forms of horrific disaster." The appeal states that in the near future, Shanghai will have to find ways to assist 500,000 impoverished refugees. Tianjin, Peiping, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other cities will face similar problems. The hospitals run by Britons in China are struggling despite the dedicated sacrifices of their staff, and resources are severely depleted. Henceforth, money and materials will be collected in Britain and transported to China, and the relief work will be managed by an organization chaired by the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, and co-chaired by the Governor of Hong Kong.

<p>[London] The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Moderator of the Church of Scotland, the Moderator of the Free Church Council, and leaders of the Congregational, Presbyterian, and Methodist churches jointly wrote to The Times, stating, "We wish to express, on behalf of the Christian churches in Britain, our shame and horror at the recent actions of Japanese aircraft bombing civilian areas in various parts of China." Recent events should prompt everyone with a conscience throughout the world to unite in strong protest against the terrible and senseless suffering of the Chinese civilians and the flames of aggressive war. We do not believe that Japan will continue to disregard the opinion of the civilized world. Therefore, we urge Japan to reconsider its policies and abandon this brutal plan.

<p>[London] The movement to boycott Japanese goods is thriving in Britain. The "Great China Movement" held a meeting last night at the Whitefield's Central Mission in London, where the hall was filled to capacity, with hundreds unable to enter due to lack of space. General Yang Hucheng attended and delivered a speech, describing the united resistance of China against Japan today, which greatly moved the audience. Liberal Party leader Sir Archibald Sinclair spoke in Wick, stating that if Britain, the Netherlands, France, and the United States boycott Japanese goods, Japan will be forced to stop its aggression against China and submit. The misfortunes suffered by Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Nanjing cannot be ignored by anyone, especially by the residents of densely populated European cities, otherwise civilization and our families will be destroyed. Member of Parliament Megan Lloyd George spoke at the Welsh Liberal Federation, advocating a ban on oil shipments to Japan. Veteran dockworkers' leader Ben Tillett spoke at the National Seamen's and Firemen's Union, praising the New Zealand dockworkers for refusing to handle Japanese military supplies for loading, hoping that dockworkers around the world will follow their example. The Daily Mail editorial stated that even if Japanese pilots strive to limit their bombing targets to military facilities, the fact that Japanese military aircraft have already killed tens of thousands of helpless non-combatants, including men, women, the elderly, and children, is glaring and cannot be concealed. The men, women, and children throughout regions with no military relevance have fallen victim to Japanese aircraft. The actions of Japanese aircraft in combat have shocked all nations and aroused public outrage. (Reuters dispatch from London on the 2nd)</p>
<p>[London] Member of Parliament and Secretary of the London Labour Party, Herbert Morrison, today sent a letter to the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Goro, expressing deep disgust and abhorrence for Japan's attack on China, "especially for Japan's violation of humanity, bombing of Chinese cities, and slaughter of innocent men, women, and children." Morrison stated, "The British Labour Party and the people of all countries maintain friendship. We do not believe that these cruel acts are advocated by Japanese workers, but the Japanese government cannot shirk its responsibility." Morrison requested the Japanese Ambassador to convey "not only the feelings of the London Labour Party, but also the aversion and anger shared by the entire population of London," and stated that the Japanese Ambassador should find a way to urge the Japanese government to immediately cease its unjustified war against the Chinese people.

<p>[Washington] U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull's language today seemed to indicate that the United States intends to reduce diplomatic exchanges with Japan in the future. However, it seems unlikely that the United States will take further action in the short term. Hull hinted that this point should be based on public opinion. (National Telegraph on the 1st)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Declares Economic Severance with Japan</h3>
<p>National Self-Defense Should Deplete Enemy Strength; Reject Japanese Goods at the Nation's Gates; Vow Not to Buy or Sell</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, resolving to issue a national declaration of economic severance with Japan and to notify various trade associations to strictly enforce it. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Notice</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: On the first day of this month, the Chamber held its fourth joint meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss the issue of how to proceed with national economic severance with Japan. It was resolved to unite various public organizations in the city to promote the national economic severance movement with Japan, and to first issue a declaration by the Chamber and to notify various trade associations to strictly implement it. Detailed measures will be formulated by the Standing Committee and placed on file. In addition to the Chamber's issuance of a declaration of economic severance with Japan and the formulation of detailed measures, a corresponding letter is hereby sent to notify your association, hoping that you will investigate and inform your colleagues to strictly implement it together and sever any economic ties with the enemy, which is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Declaration</p>
<p>Since the Japanese enemy launched a full-scale challenge against our country, they have attempted to destroy our economic center with land forces and to blockade our coastal commercial ports with fleets in China, cutting off our international trade. The Chamber dares to solemnly declare before the people of the nation that our country and Japan are in a position of sworn enemies. According to international practice, there is a law to prohibit trade with the enemy. According to the League of Nations Covenant, there are established rules for economic sanctions. Our country, out of magnanimity, has been fighting for fifty days and has not yet initiated the international rights that can be exercised, but the enemy preemptively acted, turning into an aggressor country and first carrying out the illegal tactics of economic blockade against the invaded country. Therefore, for the sake of national self-defense, for the sake of assisting the government in long-term war efforts to deplete the enemy's strength, it is truly necessary to promptly implement national economic severance with Japan. The people of the nation must know that a nation standing on the earth can only survive with a sense of shame and courage. At this time, the whole world is denouncing the atrocities of the Japanese enemy, with common public organizations proposing and public opinion advocating economic sanctions as a righteous expression. We, who are personally suffering from the atrocities of the Japanese enemy, should take the lead in rising up and never abandon ourselves, allowing economic aggression to run rampant in China. Therefore, the Chamber, with heartfelt sincerity, hereby declares to the nation that all those with blood and knowledge, please regard this statement and rise up together to implement national economic severance with Japan, reject Japanese goods outside the nation's gates, vow not to buy or sell, vow not to use them, and trap the Japanese enemy's economy in a dead end, so that we may be worthy of the difficulties of our ancestors in creating the country, the heroic courage of soldiers who forget themselves and sacrifice their lives, and the enthusiasm of friendly countries in upholding justice. May we all be aware of this.</p>

The Section has advice and suggestions for these factories.</p>
<h3>Request Exemption from Transit Duties on Rice and Grain</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Food Regulation Committee: Since the Jianghai Customs was ordered to implement the newly revised transit duty regulations from October 1st and to collect transit duties on domestic goods, including rice and grain, the rice ships arriving in Shanghai have been temporarily suspended. As this concerns the people's livelihood, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Finance yesterday requesting that customs offices in various places be ordered to exempt transit duties on domestic goods for rice and grain in order to maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>Catholic Church Holds Special Prayers</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the people have been displaced and suffered greatly.

<h3>Foreign Surgeons Willing to Treat Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Our Country's Medical Community Should Go to the Inland</p>
<p>Recently, the rear area hospitals for wounded soldiers have felt a lack of medical personnel. Yesterday, a person signing as a foreign surgeon submitted a letter to the Zi Lin Daily, which I read in various newspapers in this port. There is now an urgent need for Chinese surgeons to treat soldiers wounded in the war who are bravely resisting the mechanized forces of Japan in various hospitals at [Location Omitted]. There are quite a few top-notch Chinese surgeons trained by foreigners in Shanghai. If they can be relieved of their duties at the Shanghai hospitals for wounded soldiers, they are, I believe, eager to go to the inland to fulfill their obligations. I know that there are at least thirty foreign surgeons in Shanghai who are very happy to treat the wounded soldiers in Shanghai so that Chinese comrades can be freed up to serve in inland hospitals. If the Chinese Medical Association asks the directors of the Hong En Hospital and the Country Hospital to invite foreign surgeons, I dare to believe that there will be no shortage of responders.</p>
<h3>Enemy Anti-Aircraft Shells Destroy Houses and Injure People</h3>

<p>At 0:10 AM yesterday morning, our air force attacked the enemy's stronghold at night. The enemy ships hurriedly fired anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns, as dense as strings of beads, causing shells one foot long to fall into the Yi'an Lane at 66 Luxiangyuan Road in the city. They did not explode. Upon landing, they shattered stone fragments and injured the leg of a woman, Ms. Wang. A stray bullet also fell into the Chenxiange Temple, but no one was injured.</p>
<p>At around 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a shell suddenly fell at the intersection of Moganshan Road and Tokyo Road and exploded, injuring thirteen people, one of whom died. Chinese police officer No. 1533 sent the injured to hospitals for treatment.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Bonds Being Subscribed to in Succession</h3>

<p>Business Community Team</p>
<p>The Business Community Fundraising Team for National Salvation Bonds announced: "The various sub-teams and stores are enthusiastically subscribing to national salvation bonds, which is greatly appreciated by the team. However, the War of Resistance is now urgent and requires vast resources. It is hoped that those who have not yet subscribed will quickly subscribe, and those who have subscribed will quickly pay. Those who have paid should bring their receipts to report to the sub-teams, and the sub-teams should fill out the weekly report form on October 3rd to report to the team for forwarding to the Fundraising Association, so that those who are striving to donate can be respected, and those who are hesitant can be motivated to strive. Saving the nation is more urgent than putting out a fire; resources are military strength. We hope that all circles will pay attention. This is of utmost importance."</p>
<p>Ma Bufang</p>
<p>The National Salvation Bonds Association received a telegram from the Qinghai Provincial Branch stating that General Ma Bufang has specially turned over his self-owned house, along with 200 racks of deer antlers, to the Association to be sold to subscribe to 100,000 yuan of bonds.

<h3>Statement by U.S. Naval Commander in China on Protection of American Nationals</h3>
<p>Firmly Opposes Enemy Bombing; Decides to File Another Protest with the Enemy Army</p>
<p>U.S. Naval Commander in China, Admiral Harry E. Yarnell, issued a statement yesterday, stating that a Japanese spokesman claimed on September 28th that U.S. Ambassador to China, Nelson T. Johnson, had notified American nationals in Hankou to leave the area by a deadline. This is completely untrue. The U.S. authorities have never issued any similar notice. The U.S. fleet in China will continue to fulfill its responsibilities to protect the lives and property of American nationals along the Yangtze River. The U.S. will continue to firmly oppose the illegal and indiscriminate bombing by Japan. The U.S. naval authorities will file another protest with the Japanese side, demanding that effective safety guarantees be provided for American nationals during aerial bombing operations.</p>
<h3>Text of Municipal Government Protest Regarding the Case of Italian Soldiers Shooting Our Laborers</h3>
<p>Culprit Soldiers Should Be Punished Quickly; We Reserve the Right to Demand Compensation</p>
<p>Mayor Yu Hongjun has filed a protest with the Italian Consul General in Shanghai regarding the case of Italian sailors shooting workers at the Fuxin Flour Mill. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: According to reports, at 10:00 AM on the 29th of this month (yesterday), about forty laborers from the Fuxin Flour Mill No. 3 on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, led by Wang Jingfu, were holding passes and crossing the river on three small boats to go ashore. The first batch had already landed. When the second boat approached the shore, they were fired upon by Italian soldiers, seriously injuring one laborer, Cai Zihong, whose life is in danger, and slightly injuring one laborer, Lu Youdao. Both are currently being treated at the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road. Later reports stated that Cai Zihong died due to his serious injuries. The Mayor dispatched personnel to investigate and confirmed the facts. These laborers routinely commute to work every day. The incident occurred in the morning, certainly not late at night, which is not comparable to the curfew. Even if your country's troops wanted to prevent them from landing, there were plenty of appropriate methods. Why did they fire upon the small boat approaching the shore after the first batch had already been allowed to land, causing such harm to innocent laborers? The relationship between our two countries has always been harmonious. The Mayor considers the reckless and excessive actions of your country's troops to be regrettable. A protest is hereby filed, requesting that the culprits be identified and punished quickly. Our side reserves all rights to claim compensation for damages. We hope that you will investigate and handle this matter, and please reply to this letter. Sincerely, Yu Hongjun, Mayor of Shanghai, to Mr. [Name Omitted], Italian Consul General in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Enemy Artillery Fire Concentrated Near Liuhang, Our Fresh Troops Arrive for Fierce Counterattack</h3>
<p>Both Sides Now Deadlocked at the Bridgehead North of the Wenzaobang Canal, Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat at Shi Xiang Gong Temple This Morning, Enemy at Zhabei Repelled After Attacking with Tanks</p>
<p>After issuing orders for the fourth general offensive on the 29th of last month, the enemy exhausted all its naval, land, and air forces in an attempt to break through our lines between Luodian and Liuhang. Our army, with its strong force and solid defenses, faced the enemy's large-scale assaults on our entire line countless times, inflicting heavy casualties and leaving corpses scattered everywhere. Our lines remained unshaken. The enemy then withdrew the majority of its troops from the downtown area and reinforced the Luodian-Liuhang line, launching a joint offensive. Our positions at Liuhang and Gujiazhai were heavily damaged by intense enemy artillery fire. To avoid excessive casualties, we temporarily retreated to new positions. Soon after, fresh troops arrived and immediately launched a full-scale counterattack, engaging in repeated back-and-forth battles. The enemy suffered extraordinarily heavy casualties, and we also sustained considerable losses. Currently, both sides are deadlocked at the bridgehead north of the Wenzaobang Canal. This morning, the enemy launched another major offensive, and the battle continued until noon, when they were repelled by our forces. In the Luodian area, enemy artillery fire remained concentrated on our army's positions around the Shi Xiang Gong Temple, with intense fighting continuing throughout the night. This morning, the two armies engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat. In the Zhabei area, enemy marine corps launched large-scale offensives for several consecutive days but were repeatedly defeated by our forces. This morning, two to three hundred enemy soldiers, under the cover of tanks, charged towards our Commercial Press positions. Our defending troops calmly responded, and the enemy, unable to withstand the resistance, retreated. This morning, in the Miaohang-Dachang area, large formations of enemy aircraft dropped bombs, but our army sustained minimal damage.

<h3>Captured Enemy Pilot Expresses His Intentions</h3>
<p>Bombing Nanjing Was Not His Wish</p>
<p>[Suzhou] Enemy Air Force Captain Yamashita Shichiro, who flew to bomb Nanjing on the 26th of last month, was forced to land over Taicang and has now been captured by us and is being treated with courtesy. Yamashita is from Kurume City, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, and lives in Omura Town, Nagasaki Prefecture. He departed from Omura for Shanghai on September 7th and bombed Nanjing three times on September 26th before landing in Taicang. According to Yamashita, this operation was entirely at the behest of the military. Ordinary people and lower-ranking officers are very averse to the war. His bombing of Nanjing was entirely under the pressure of orders and was not his true desire. Yamashita wrote a letter to his wife one day, stating briefly that he had been captured and was being treated well, asking his family not to worry, and saying that after the war stopped, he planned to study abroad and would no longer engage in warfare.

<p>Canadian Peace Council Requests Government to Impose Sanctions</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Japanese aircraft bombing of Chinese cities, public and private organizations across the country are now redoubling their efforts to demand that the government find ways to stop the Japanese military's atrocities.

<h3>Enemy Navy Sets Fire to Our Civilian Ships</h3>
<p>Eighty Sailors Imprisoned and Burned Alive, Account of an English Ship's Crew</p>
<p>Recently, the enemy navy has been using submarines to indiscriminately kill innocent people in various places along our coast, which is inhumane to the extreme. Even more recently, enemy warships set fire to two large Chinese civilian ships off the coast of Hong Kong, burning to death all seven or eighty sailors on board, leaving no one alive. The cruelty is even more outrageous. A certain ship of the British Swire Company, which returned to Shanghai from Hongji this time, arrived in Shanghai this morning. According to its crew, when the ship sailed from Hong Kong to the sea off Huadengshan, at 11:00 PM on the 28th, they saw two large Chinese cargo ships, each with a carrying capacity of about 500 tons and three masts. Near the two civilian ships, there was a Japanese warship, which was setting fire to the two ships. The ship immediately went to rescue them. After approaching, the Japanese warship hung a red light, prohibiting our ship from approaching, and shined a searchlight, and seeing that it was an English ship, the Japanese ship sailed away. When our ship approached the two civilian ships, it saw that all sides of the two ships had been set on fire, forming like two volcanoes. The crew of our ship shouted loudly on the sea to search for anyone who had fallen into the sea, but no one was found. Finally, it was learned that all the people on the two ships had been locked in the cabins by the Japanese warship and then burned alive, so no one could escape. The ship took several photos of the fire and the actions of the Japanese warships at that time, and is preparing to send them to the consulates to show the cruelty and inhumanity of the Japanese warships.</p>
<h3>Drafting of a Resolution by the Subcommittee of the League of Nations Advisory Committee</h3>
<p>Based on the Avenol Report, China, Britain, and France Reach an Agreement</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Subcommittee of the League of Nations Advisory Committee held three consecutive meetings today to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute, lasting for more than twelve hours. As a result, there are no longer any differences of opinion within the committee. China, Britain, and France have reached an agreement on the following principle: that there are several facts that can be assessed and have been proven to be true, and the draft resolution of the Subcommittee should be a reasonable conclusion based on these facts. The Subcommittee held its first meeting in the morning to review the report submitted by League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, which included three points: ㊀ The origin and development of military actions in the Far East, ㊁ Japan's obligations to China under the Paris Pact and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, ㊂ Japan's obligations to other countries. The representatives of Poland and China engaged in a verbal battle during the discussion. The Polish representative argued that the Subcommittee should draft a report describing the history of the Sino-Japanese dispute, and said that the League of Nations' prestige had been damaged once in 1931, so it should be cautious in handling the Far East issue. The Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, refuted this, saying that the Subcommittee could not merely draft such a report to evade its responsibilities. The second meeting was held at 3:30 PM to continue the discussion, and the final meeting was held in the evening, ending at midnight. The draft report was completed, which reviewed the course of events in the Far East and explained Japan's obligations under the Paris Pact and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, as well as the fact that Japan had violated these obligations. The Chairman of the Subcommittee, Latvian Foreign Minister Menders, will use this report as a basis, together with legal experts from the League of Nations, to draft a final resolution. British delegation officials stated after the Subcommittee meeting that the draft resolution would be submitted to the Advisory Committee for a vote and then passed by the League of Nations Assembly. "The draft has a firm tone, at least as strong as the League of Nations Assembly's resolution on the Spanish issue," they said. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Minor Critiques</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Sir Alan Rae Smith, a renowned British financier, has donated £1,000 as a first step to aid the more than 10,000 Chinese civilians in various cities who have been crippled by Japanese bombs and are in dire need of rescue. Furthermore, organizations such as the British United Council for Missionary Work and the British Red Cross Society have also launched appeals to raise funds to provide relief to wounded and sick Chinese soldiers and civilians. The enthusiasm and generosity of these friendly nations in supporting our compatriots are truly admirable and deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>However, looking back at our own country, there are also many individuals who possess tens of millions or even hundreds of millions in family wealth. They live lavishly, indulging in fine clothes and rich foods, boasting of their extravagance, and their faces are frequently seen. Yet, the loyal and brave soldiers who are fighting the enemy for our country, as well as the innocent civilians who have been crippled by bombs, are suffering from untreated wounds and illnesses, and lack food and clothing due to hunger and cold. This situation is now ubiquitous. However, searching throughout the country for someone like Sir Alan Rae Smith is proving impossible. Even the one or two great philanthropists who have sacrificed their families for the country, when their family wealth is examined, do not belong to the so-called luxurious clans that are attracting worldwide attention, but are merely small or medium-sized bourgeois. On the other hand, the so-called luxurious clans that are attracting worldwide attention remain silent. This is truly strange. Is it possible that the Chinese people's love for their compatriots is less than the love of friendly nations for us? Or is it that the wounded and sick loyal soldiers and innocent civilians find it difficult to gain the sympathy of the wealthy? Or is their blood so cold that they are unmoved?</p>

<h3>Reasons for Our Army's Abandonment of Cangxian on the Jinpu Railway Line</h3>
<p>The Enemy Decided to Divert Water to Flood Our Positions; Our Forces Will Immediately Counterattack After Regrouping</p>
<p>According to people from Jinan, since the enemy reinforced their forces on the Jinpu Railway Line, they have repeatedly pressured us with heavy troops. Our army, defending the line north of Yaoguantun, and the loyal and brave soldiers have been fighting fiercely since the beginning of the Japanese aggression. The battles have been extremely fierce, with an estimated 3,000 or more enemies killed. After suffering a disastrous defeat, the enemy did not dare to charge. Instead, on the 24th, they changed tactics, using aircraft and artillery cover to launch a fierce attack on us. Our army fought bravely, engaging in several bloody battles. Yaoguantun was repeatedly gained and lost, with even more enemies killed. In the afternoon, the artillery fire intensified, with dozens of enemy cannons bombarding our positions. Our forward positions were completely destroyed. Our army had no choice but to abandon Yaoguantun, regrouping its forces north of Cangxian to resist again, and redeploying fresh troops. Armored cars traveled back and forth between Cangxian and Zhuanhe, patrolling and covering the rear, with troops continuously moving forward. That evening, enemy troops entered Yaoguantun. The vanguard cavalry was once discovered south of Yaoguantun, but they were repelled by us and did not dare to return. By the morning of the 25th, our army's position had Cangxian as its front. We constructed fortifications at Jiandi, north of Zhuanhe, south of Cangxian. The left flank was at Baimapo, west of Yaoguantun, and the right flank was along the Chenghe River, north of Zhuanhe. Unexpectedly, the enemy breached the Yunhe River, west of Zhuanhe, and our left-wing army was surrounded by water. The fortifications were flooded, and we had no choice but to withdraw the forward troops backward. The military headquarters prepared boats to transport soldiers to block the breach. However, at this time, rumors spread that Baoding had fallen, unsettling the morale. The enemy took the opportunity to attack. Enemy forces were also discovered on the opposite bank of the Chenghe River, south of Cangxian. Under these threats, we had no choice but to abandon this important town in southern Hebei. Our army stationed in Cangxian city also retreated south at the same time. Two or three armored car teams covered the Fengjiakou station north of Zhuanhe, where the Beida Bridge had been destroyed. At this time, enemy armored cars arrived and pressured us with artillery fire. After our army retreated, the left and right flank positions were not yet firmly established, and there were no defenses to hold at Zhuanhe Station on the front line. At 5 p.m., we retreated from Zhuanhe to Botou. As of the evening of the 25th, the enemy had not advanced further south. Our army's fresh troops have been fully assembled and are determined to defend this last stronghold and fight the enemy. In summary, the reasons for the retreat from Cangxian were: first, the left flank was surrounded by water, destroying fortifications; second, the newly replaced troops had not yet firmly established their positions; and third, the fall of Baoding strategically constrained Cangxian, causing the southward retreat. However, our troop strength was completely unharmed. The deployment is now complete, and a counterattack will be launched soon, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Propaganda of Peace Talks</h3>
<p>Mayor Yu Has Denied It</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a Japanese spokesperson told foreign reporters yesterday that the Chinese side is currently in contact with the Japanese side regarding peace talks. Foreign reporters inquired about this statement to Mayor Yu of this city, who denied it. He stated that if such a thing were happening, he would be aware of it. The Japanese side's fabrication of facts clearly serves another purpose. Mayor Yu continued, stating that he met yesterday with a senior general from the front lines who informed him of Japanese propaganda claiming that the Japanese army could resolve the Shanghai war by October 15th, forcing China back to the situation five years ago, during the January 28th Incident. The senior general retorted to Mayor Yu, "What does this 'October 15th' refer to? October 15th of the Republic of China year 26, or October 15th of year 27, 28…?" After speaking, they smiled at each other, showing the enemy's intentions. However, our front lines are solid, and the enemy will definitely not succeed, he said.</p>

<h3>China Labor Association and Others Telegraph European and American Labor Unions</h3>
<p>Hoping to Unleash the Power of International Labor to Promote Economic Sanctions Against Japan</p>
<p>The China Labor Association, the Shanghai General Labor Union, and the National Postal Workers' Union jointly telegraphed leaders of the general labor unions of European and American countries yesterday, requesting them to urge their governments to implement economic sanctions against Japan. The original text stated: "To Mr. Royse of the Committee for Industrial Organization in the United States, Mr. Green of the Federation of Labor, Mr. Citrine of the British Trades Union Congress, Mr. Jouhaux of the French General Confederation of Labor, Mr. Kupers of the Dutch Confederation of Trade Unions, Mr. Edo Fimmen of the International Transport Workers' Federation, Mr. Siveynaar of the International Federation of Industrial Organizations, Mr. Reinauer of the Postal, Telegraph and Telephone International, and all fellow workers, With great respect, Japanese imperialists, in order to fulfill their dream of a continental policy and their ambition to dominate the world, have disregarded international conventions, disrupted East Asian peace, and invaded China with heavy troops. They have illegally blockaded our various seaports and bombed important cities such as Nanjing, Hankou, and Guangzhou, causing significant damage to the interests of the great powers in China. Thousands of innocent civilians, women, and children have been brutally killed in war, reaching the extreme of inhumane behavior. If effective sanctions are not swiftly adopted, our country will sacrifice itself for the sake of resisting aggression without any regard. However, the destruction of this vast Far Eastern market will threaten the fellow workers of all countries. Our associations humbly appeal to your associations from the standpoint of the same class, hoping to unleash the power of the masses to urge your governments to implement economic sanctions against Japan, to curb the ambition of the aggressors and to uphold international justice. This telegram is respectfully sent, awaiting your clear instructions. The China Labor Association, the Shanghai General Labor Union, and the National Postal Workers' Union, together salute."</p>
<h3>The Four Banks Are Ordered to Underwrite Cotton Loans</h3>
<p>Negotiation of Import and Export Bills and Mortgages to Continue; Provincial Governments Borrow to Purchase Cotton</p>
<p>This year's national cotton production has been abundant, increasing by more than 2.6 million piculs compared to last year. Hebei Province has the highest production, with 3,993,857 piculs. Hubei and Jiangsu provinces follow, with Hubei producing 3,433,901 piculs and Jiangsu producing 2,800,9402 piculs. At this time of our country's all-out war of resistance, Shanghai, which has the largest number of Chinese and foreign yarn factories, has been reduced to a war zone. The factories have been forced to shut down, leading to an oversupply in the market and a sharp drop in cotton prices. At the same time, due to the tightening of money, manufacturers are unable to purchase new cotton. In addition to borrowing from banks and other financial institutions on their own to purchase cotton, provincial governments have also requested assistance from the Ministry of Finance to avoid affecting the livelihoods of farmers. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications and the Agricultural Bank to underwrite various cotton loans as much as possible. After receiving the order, the four banks decided to offer special concessions to manufacturers who want to borrow money to purchase new cotton in the interior. At the same time, they will continue to offer concessions for manufacturers who want to apply for mortgages and negotiate import and export bills for the cotton they have purchased.</p>
<h3>British Shipping Company Expands Routes</h3>
<p>South China Route to Annam; Yangtze River Route Has Been Connected</p>
<p>After enemy warships blockaded our seaports, the Shanghai sea routes, which were restored by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and Butterfield &amp; Swire on August 28th, have been monopolized by British merchants. Now, from October 1st, Butterfield &amp; Swire will expand the Shanghai routes, designating four main routes and extending the sea routes to Annam to transport passengers and goods to and from Shanghai. The four routes are arranged as follows: (A) Shanghai-South China route, via Xiamen, Shantou, Guangdong, and Hong Kong. In Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Shantou, Shanghai liners will be connected with ships to Manila, Bangkok (Siam), Singapore, Penang, and other places. Four ships will depart from Shanghai every week, with eight to ten ships being assigned to this route. (B) Shanghai-Annam Haiphong route, also via Hong Kong, and passing through Haikou and Beihai. One ship will depart from Shanghai every week. (C) Shanghai-North China route, via Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, to Tianjin. Two ships will depart from Shanghai every week, currently using three ships. (D) Shanghai-Ningbo route. The company has taken back the New Beijing ship for direct voyages, now changed to two voyages per week. In addition, (1) the direct North-South China route from Tianjin, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Qingdao to Hong Kong and Guangzhou, will depart once a week. (2) The Yangtze River ships, from Zhenjiang, Nanjing to Hankou, and Yichang, will depart twice a week starting from October 1st. Jardine Matheson's North China route will depart twice a week, and the South China route will also depart twice a week. The Yangtze River schedule is similar to that of Butterfield &amp; Swire. As for the transportation of Shanghai goods to the Yangtze River, a special arrangement has been agreed upon between the two companies and various customs brokers. If the quantity is small, it can be transferred from the inland river to Zhenjiang, and then connected to the Yangtze River ships of the two companies, for shipment to Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, Hunan, and various ports in Sichuan. Goods from the Yangtze River to Shanghai can also be transported in the same way.</p>

<h3>Sacrifice Is My Wish</h3>
<p>— She Mengyao</p>
<p>To improve the organization of the "Shanghai Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps," we are conducting a second re-registration because the forms from the first registration were not filled out in detail, and many members lost their armbands due to their duties. To prevent accidents, it was decided to conduct a second re-registration. There are three registration forms: (1) Membership Application, (2) Volunteer Form, (3) Parental Permission Form.</p>
<p>To assess the abilities of each Boy Scout and the knowledge gained from Boy Scout training, each Boy Scout must be tested when submitting the registration form to understand their personality, abilities, knowledge, etiquette, and other qualities. This started on the 25th.</p>
<p>The submission of forms and oral examinations were very orderly because the adjutant had been instructed to notify the Boy Scouts stationed at various service locations in advance, specifying the date they should come to the corps for the examination. In this way, the numbers were called in batches, and individual examinations were conducted, so it naturally did not appear chaotic or crowded. The examination lasted for five days.</p>
<p>There were three examiners. One was Mr. Leng Xueqiao, the chairman of the Corps Affairs Committee, but he was very busy with official duties, so he did not come often. Another was Mr. Shen Yu, the director of the Command Office, who had a solemn and straightforward face and was the most diligent practitioner of the New Life Movement. The other was Mr. Wei Haoyuan, the deputy director of the Command Office, a young, plump man with firm skin and a dignified yet amiable face. He looked very earnest due to being busy, asking questions during the examination while also busy listening to the phone and writing official documents. His plump face was rosy like an apple, clearly a capable and hardworking person.</p>
<p>The Boy Scouts on duty called out the numbers in the waiting area, and the Boy Scouts individually entered the director's office to take the examination. They looked very nervous, but their spirits were high. Pushing open the door, they energetically snapped to attention and gave a three-finger salute, then stood upright, waiting for the examination.</p>
<p>"Where are you serving now?" The deputy director held the form in his hand, looked at it for a moment, and began to ask.</p>
<p>"At the ×× shelter," the Boy Scout answered, standing at attention.</p>
<p>"What level of Boy Scout training have you received?" He asked the next question.</p>
<p>"Intermediate level, but not completed," the Scout replied, looking a little nervous.</p>
<p>"What does the second clause of the Boy Scout oath say?"</p>
<p>"To help others at all times and serve the public."</p>
<p>"What is the seventh Boy Scout law?"</p>
<p>"—is etiquette, oh! No, I remembered it wrong, it's honesty, loyalty, helpfulness, kindness, courtesy, fairness, obedience, it's obedience!" Due to a momentary lapse in memory, he blurted out the wrong answer, then immediately recited from the beginning to the seventh clause, before loudly saying it was obedience, looking somewhat flustered.</p>
<p>"How many points of the compass are there?"</p>
<p>"Sixteen."</p>
<p>"Mr. Wei, phone call!" Someone said from the side, and then there was "Hello, yes, oh, ah," a burst of listening to the phone. He asked again, "How do you signal the number '61' in semaphore?" The Boy Scout separated his feet, raised both hands flat, showing the posture of semaphore signaling.</p>
<p>"How many ways are there to carry an injured person?"</p>
<p>"This, this first aid training hasn't been done yet!" He looked a little constrained.</p>
<p>"If we go to serve with the army, leaving Shanghai, would you go?"</p>
<p>"Yes! I would go!" His voice became louder again.</p>
<p>"Serving with the army is very dangerous! Are you afraid?"</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid! Even if I have to sacrifice myself, it's my wish!" The examiner was moved by his strong tone.</p>
<p>"Very good! You are very ambitious. Take this volunteer form for service with the army, fill it out, and submit it."</p>
<p>"Yes!" He took the volunteer form with both hands, gave a three-finger salute, and turned around and walked out, with a clear smile on his face, seemingly very excited.</p>
<p>"Number 642!" The Boy Scout on duty called out again in the waiting area, and another Boy Scout stood up and walked into the director's office.</p>
<h3>Bloody Wind</h3>
<p>— □ Juan</p>
<p>Mr. Jian Youwen, a martyr of the Great China, often used "Southeast Wind," "Northwest Wind," etc., as the titles of his essays and miscellaneous thoughts, due to regional differences. He picked them up casually and did not lose the intention of the Book of Songs. Since the launch of our country's all-out war of resistance, I have heard that all winds, east, west, south, and north, are filled with blood; hence the name of my article is "Bloody Wind."</p>
<p>Our army's new front lines in Shanghai, although constantly bombarded by the enemy's most fierce artillery fire and bombs, and constantly attacked by infantry, cavalry, and tanks, are like copper walls and iron barriers, still standing firm, a hundred times more solid than our old Great Wall. This is truly like the lyrics of the March of the Volunteers, "Let our flesh and blood build our new Great Wall."</p>
<p>The best way to deal with the evil traitors is to follow the old law and execute the entire family; then, in order to avoid being implicated, family members would have to monitor each other every day, and no one would dare to be a traitor again. If the crime does not extend to relatives, and the execution of the entire family cannot be carried out, I think that beheading should be the only punishment for the traitors themselves. In recent years, Germany has been using beheading to deal with traitors, even women are not exempt. Therefore, it cannot be said to be cruel to decapitate extremely evil traitors. Shooting them is not only too cheap for the traitors, but also too uneconomical; saving each bullet can at least kill an enemy who is invading us.</p>
<p>When the Japanese planes bombed the Rihui Port in Shanghai, they also killed many innocent civilians. Among them was a pregnant woman whose stomach was pierced by shrapnel, and the little hand of the fetus stretched out of her stomach. After a while, it was born on its own, but the little life was no longer safe. Everyone, try to close your eyes and think about what a tragic scene this is! Alas! It's a pity that this child is dead; if he were alive, I would be willing to hold his little hands, step into this bloody world, put him in a safe area in the rear, and raise him well, giving him air force education from childhood, and constantly making him look at the posthumous image of his mother, encouraging him day and night, and creating him into an incomparably brave air force warrior. When he completes his studies one day, he will lead a large air force across the sea to the east, dropping hundreds of large bombs to turn the two islands of Fusang into a white land. Haha! What a joyful revenge!</p>
<p>Huang Qiuyue (Jun), a famous poet who floated in the officialdom, had a great reputation, but unfortunately, he was blinded by material desires and went crazy. He and his son colluded and became great traitors who sold their motherland and compatriots. Finally, the truth came out, and he suffered extreme punishment, leaving behind a notorious reputation for thousands of years. If he meets the two old poets Chen Shiyi and Chen Sanyuan in the underworld (note that the two old poets recently died and both had a long association with Huang), what face will he have? I am afraid that the two old men will spit on him regardless, and there will be a sigh that you were originally a beautiful person, why did you become a thief?</p>
