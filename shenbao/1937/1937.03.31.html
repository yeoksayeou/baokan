<p>時評</p>
<h3>巨艦大砲政策的復活</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>華盛頓海約約與倫敦海約於去年年底同時滿期以後。今年各國即開始造艦的大競賽。美國羅斯福總統已於新年中向國會提出巨額國防預算的咨文。英國議會除已通過龐大的軍事費之外。並核准巨額國防公債的發行。遠東的日本也於今年實行第三次的海軍補充計劃。預定十年之內造艦六十萬噸之巨。其他法意德蘇諸國自然也繼起直追。不讓英美日獨美於前。</p>
<p>各國的造艦大競賽雖自去年年底海約滿期後即行開始。但是巨艦大砲的政策。却是從最近日本拒絕加入最大砲位限制的規定後纔重新復活的。原來去年倫敦海軍會議雖因日本的退出而沒有商妥各國海軍之量的限制辦法。但是英美法三國却於事後商妥局部之質的限制辦法。即三萬五千噸主力艦備砲的最大口徑應以十四吋為限。不過這個限制辦法規定須得其他海軍强國同樣接受以後姑能生效。所以從去年十二月起。英國即極力慫恿日本加入新協定。並希望日本能於四月底以前發出滿意的答復。可是現在日本已於二十七日正式拒絕加入這限制最大砲徑為十四吋的規定。</p>
<p>了。由於日本的拒絕加入。這個質的限制辦法也自然隨之失效。因為沒有一個海軍强國是願見他的海艦戰鬥力不及他國的。據外電所傳。美國已决計將今夏開始建造之主力艦二艘。裝置十六吋口徑之重砲。同時英國方面也準備建造三萬五千噸以上的巨艦。從此十餘年前的大砲巨艦政策又要重新復活了。</p>
<p>日本拒絕參加倫敦新海約的理由。係指祇有質的限制而沒有量的限制。是根本違反軍縮精神的。這種說法在表面上看去。自有相當的理由。因為軍備之量的限制實與質的限制有同樣的重要。甚至比質的限制還更重要。而現在倫敦新海約置量的限制於不顧。而僅規定一部分之質的限制（就廣義說。質的限制應包括重砲巨艦轟炸機毒氣等侵略性武器的廢除。）這自然談不上真正的軍縮精神。不過我們話得回頭來說。這種一部分之質的限制辦法。雖然不能使人滿意。但是比之沒有限制。總要好些。同時我們還得指出。去年倫敦海軍會議之所以不能商妥量的限制辦法。就是由於日本抱着向外發展的政策。堅持比率平等主義。甚至退出大會。以致會議完全失敗。現在日本却反說英美法三國所商妥的限制辦法。祇着重質而未顧及量。這真充分表現出侵略主義之自欺欺人的態度了。</p>
<p>現在海上軍備的競賽。在量與質的方面。都已積極開始了。名記者華納雖在紐約民聲講壇報說。美國仍願遵守量的限制。切望英國發起談判。重訂新約。同特英國雖已任命軍縮專家克萊琪為駐日本大使。道經美國前往東京就職。準備乘機重開海縮談判。可是在這火藥氣籠罩下的世界。軍縮使者所碰到的總難免是一鼻于的灰罷。</p>

<h3>議會解散空氣濃厚日本政局混沌</h3>
<p>選舉法修正案為中心　政黨與政府暗中衝突</p>
<p>［東京］政府因政黨以選舉法案為中心、竟將政府之提案停止審議、乃於三十日午後　四時十分召開緊急閣議、當由閣員報告審查議案之情勢、並討論對策、如米內海相則述以强硬意見、略謂政民兩黨對於選舉法修正案、强要政府予以通過、並使重要法案之審議停止進行、此種事實、萬難認為政黨具有誠意、故應對於政黨在促其反省之意義下、實行解散者也云、但山崎農相與兒玉遞相等人、則主張自重之說、謂政黨方面之說法、亦有不為無理之點、政府對於此處亦須充分加以考慮、同時對於政黨促其反省、未知各位以為何如、杉山陸相及其他諸員均經陳述意見、現正協議應否解散之問題、故其情形至為嚴重也、（三十日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］政民兩黨極力希望通過選舉法修正案、而政府則未積極努力、今日貴族院之該項委員會在午前中即散會、於是政民之空氣驟然惡化、今日眾院大會開會、同時即行休息、自午後二時起民政黨之櫻內小泉與政友會之松野安藤等人　討論促進議案　與通過選舉法之問題、兩黨對於政府關於選舉法之態度、若仍不努力促其通過該項法案、則重要法案之審議亦將停頓、故政府之態度與政黨之處理此間　極堪注目者也、（三十日同盟電）</p>
<h3>眾院大會</h3>
<p>議場空氣不佳</p>
<p>［東京］眾院大會今日自午後二時二十分開會、同時即行休息、經過兩小時又四十分、直至午後五時方繼續開議、社大之三宅正一氏對於議事之進行、要求發言、大聲疾呼曰、</p>
<p>政府企圖進行議事、特為之延長會期六天、而政黨則喧嚷於選舉法改正與人權蹂躪問題、並未進行審議、實屬有失議會之權威、直可謂之醜態百出、且大會開議之際、竟休息若此其久、浪費時間、理由何在、</p>
<p>富田議長答</p>
<p>議長為謀進行圓滿議事起見、不得已而休息者也至此即開始議事、變更日程、討論政府所提之‘產業公會中央金庫法修正案”、由山畸總相說明提案理由後、託交委員、</p>
<p>又緊急提出左列兩案、㊀日本燃料工業　股分公司法案、㊁人造石油製造法案、均照委員會報告確定可决、</p>
<p>其次提出政府之‘百貨店法案’、大島寅吉（民政）與商相作問答後、政友之鶴憲市向陸海兩相質問、據最近軍部之主張、認為農村乃國防力之貯水池、故農村之窮困、則國防力發生缺陷云云、而對於中小商工業家毫未提及、究係何故、</p>
<p>商相作簡單答覆、軍部大臣未置答、</p>
<p>其次由前田幸作氏與商相關於百貨店稅之新設有所問答後、託交委員會又將下列兩案　由各派添以附帶决議確定可决、㊀船員法修正案、㊁日本無线電信股份公司法修正案、</p>
<p>此時民政黨之服部崎市動議變更日程、以便審議議員所提之法案、</p>
<p>富田議長起稱——</p>
<p>關於變更日程、正與政府交涉、請暫候為要、</p>
<p>當時議塲之空氣似覺不佳、政府亦不贊成、在書記官往來之後、議長即宣告休息、時已六時卅九分、（三十日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］今次議會重要法案明年度豫算案、因二十九日通過貴族院正式成立、然議會會期雖經政府延長六日、然現在僅餘兩日、而政府法案四十四件尚未成立、其中有製鐵事業法案、輸出統制稅法案等重要法、恐難在此短期間內審議、因此各方面觀察、政府必須更延長會期一日、政府當局亦認有延長會期之必要、（三十日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］日本銀行總裁池田成彬、二十九日晚訪問林首相、會談一小時餘、池田總裁詳細說明財界現狀、林首相原擬於議會結束後、實施現內閣獨自之政策、故由藏相聽取經濟財界情形、又由池田總裁聽取種種意見、以資確立政策之參考、（三十日同盟電）</p>
<h3>美决進行補充造艦計劃</h3>
<p>大海軍派計畫擱置　英報評論海軍競爭</p>
<p>［華盛頓］今日消息、美國高級海軍官員、對於造艦計劃、已决定不顧他國之行動如何、暫在目前維持隨時補充之原則、大海軍派所擬添建巡艦十艘之計劃、已被擱置、海軍部長史璜生亦贊成　此項主張、以免再蹈歐戰後多數驅逐艦同告陳舊之覆轍、據悉、海軍或將依照國會所通過之女王德拉邁爾法、於一九四二年以前、將美國海軍建造至條約所許可之限度、並於本年度內、建造主力艦二艘、海軍參謀長黎希上將雖曾聲明、美國海軍已决定維持至與任何國實力相等、故英國海軍擴充計劃、或將使美國亦增建軍艦、惟以情勢觀之、美國恐仍將保守原定計劃、海軍官員則表示、對於英國七年造艦計劃、並不驚奇、惟此項决定、亦非表示一二年內各國仍有締結海軍條約之希望、在官方亦迄未聞得召開海軍會議之消息、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］日本政府日前通知英國、對於一九三六年倫敦海軍條約所規定之主力艦砲徑限制（即十四吋）拒不接收、泰晤士報頃評論此事、措詞頗為嚴厲　略稱、‘今後主力艦砲位口徑、若由倫敦條約所規定之十四吋、改為十六吋、則海軍軍備競爭、即將重復開始、此種競爭、能否避免、其權操諸日本、綠該國去年雖中途退出海軍會議、若苟能於四月一日之前、接受十四吋之砲徑限制、則海軍軍備競爭、當可挽回、否則世界各國、勢必競事擴張海軍、漫無限制、有類風狂、此其責任誰屬、蓋毫無疑義矣’云、（中央社卅日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>工業展覽會</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>上海為全國工業的中心，上海的工業進步到怎樣地位？這是很值得一觀的，最近上海市政府社會局籌備舉行一個大規模的上海市工業展覽會，這是促進工業技術，引起市民注意國貨工業的最好方法，决非尋常集會所可比擬的。</p>
<p>吾人認為上海市工業展覽會籌備之初，要注意三點。</p>
<p>第一　這次徵集的物品，要注意國貨的等級和品質標準，須認真取擇，萬不可濫。如果有疑問的時候，一定要實地調查，確無疑問，然後纔可選入，倘使只有販賣的店號，而沒有工廠的，不取。有工廠的形式，而實際上沒有工作技術的，不取。純粹是外國技師外國原料的，不取。因為上海市是各國觀瞻所緊，萬目睽睽，如果有冒濫苟且的地方，不但自損聲譽，並為各國所輕視竊笑的。</p>
<p>第二　既稱上海市工業展覽會，則所有上海的工廠出品，當然都在徵集之列。濫收固不可，漏列亦不妥。故在籌備之時，最好注重調查工作，凡屬有價值而值得展覽之工業品，都應多方徵集，不使遺漏。倘屬創造發明富有提倡價值之出品，尤該特別陳列，促人注意。</p>
<p>第三　徵集品的分類，要十分注意，使觀眾一覽了然，不會混淆。陳列的方法，最好採用製造程序的方式，如毛織品，可從羊毛起，以迄製成呢布止，中間一步步的手續，都可陳列出來，加以說明，既表示製造的方法，藉可見到技術的優劣，更可以使市民明瞭製作的步驟，更堅其愛用國貨的信心。而冒濫虛偽的弊病，也可免除，這是很要注意的。</p>
<p>總之，工業展覽會的舉行，是一件重要的事情，事前的調查，徵集，分類，審查，取舍，臨事的陳列，布置，事後的品評，研究，以及獎勵等，在在應用嚴密手績，科學方法，始臻完美。更需要工業界踴躍參加，熱心協助，以玉成這種偉大的舉動。</p>
<h3>鹽質和齒牙的衛生</h3>
<p>— 向榮</p>
<p>人類身體組織上最堅硬的東西，恐怕要算牙齒了。照一般道理說，牙齒既是最堅硬的東西，當然最不容易損壞了。但在事實上却完全兩樣，據專家統計，世界上患牙病的人却是隨處皆是，至少要佔全體人口的百分之六十以上。</p>
<p>因為，牙齒雖然堅硬，但有幾種東西，却最容易損壤它，第一是酸類，特別是乳酸，這種東西，（在糖質裏面都有的），徜若它存留在我們口腔裏面，他可以使我們牙齒上面的琺瑯質慢慢疎解，一片片的脫落，一到他露出裏面象牙質的時候，我們牙內的神經便會發痛了：第二是微生物，這種東西在我們牙齒上時刻可以給我們製造毒質，不僅使牙齒受損，而且使口腔和整個身體都會發生毛病：第三是齒垢，這是保存酸類和微生物，腐化牙齒的東西。因為有了這三種東西，所以人類的牙齒便受看很大的損害。</p>
<p>要免除這種損害，自然最重要的便是注重齒牙和口腔的衛生，刷牙齒自然不成問題，而潔齒品的應用，也是每天所必不可少的。</p>
<p>關於潔齒品方面，就性質方面來說，有牙膏，牙粉，及漱口水等多種，就質料方面來說，有薄荷，炭酸鈣，和白堊，和鹼性等各種的東西。不過據近代科學的研究，知道鹽質也是最好的一種潔齒品。第一，因為鹽質能夠中和我們口中的酸性物質，使他們不能侵害牙齒上面的琺瑯質，第二，鹽質具有强烈的殺菌力，一般人都將他用作防腐劑，所以，他可以殺盡我們口中的微生物，而無傷於我們的身體。第三，他具有去齒垢的作用。此外，還可除去口臭，此點在保護口腔的衛生上也是異常重要的。</p>
<p>其實，鹽質對於齒牙衛生上的重大効用，我國早已有人注意，如許多人用食鹽刷牙便是明證。只是，沒有將他加以科學的製配，當然美中不足。據我所知，塘沽久大精鹽公司曾用鹽質製有海王星牙膏及牙粉嗽口水等，只是，此種物品，在北方固然很多，在南方還不十分普遍，據說，他潔齒的効用還不錯呢。</p>
<p>所以，我們不要只知道鹽質是維持生活的重要東西，而且還應該了解他與齒牙衛生上有重大的關係咧。</p>
<h3>推銷淺說（五）</h3>
<p>— 定凱</p>
<p>㊂噱頭推銷方式的透視</p>
<p>我們常常看見某種貨品或某公司商店，專恃着新穎的思想，憑層出不窮的‘玩意兒’來推銷出品，或專在‘廉價’及贈品‘摸彩’等方法上看想，而事業的本身或偶然有成，或依然不振，或竟因此而影饗了整個的事業者有之，對於售貨上的成本，（副成本）如廣告贈品等，反因以增加，此上海人通常所稱謂噱頭是也。</p>
<p>基於人生的思想上習性上的嗜好，凡刺激性的感受，及新穎觀感的接觸，當然可以引起某一時期的需要，但境過情遷，就成了某一時期的陳跡，我們知道工商事業的創設，原以造成一種基礎為主旨，如為一時的鼓動則相宜，如圖永久的根據則不可，茲再舉其觀點分析如次：</p>
<p>推銷術㊀噱頭動人㊁跌價引誘㊂贈品號召㊃摸彩轟動　動機的由來均基於求貨品的暢銷或競争上的争勝或存貨的過多　所獲利益限於一時</p>
<p>作者根本上並不反對噱頭方法的運用，而且極力主張應有新穎方法的推行，方足以佐貨品銷行的根基，我又常常把推行上述方法的工商，暗中去觀察他們，並就經騐得有如下的斷語。</p>
<p>㊀為一時之計，有利無弊，且足造成貸品印入消費者心理的機會。</p>
<p>㊁為存貨出清計，－時運用，占有便宜。</p>
<p>㊂為新的市塲的開闢，兼為一時廣告上之協助。</p>
<p>㊃為舊的市塲的維持，謀新陳代謝機能的鼓動。</p>
<p>這斷語的結束是‘暫時的一種動態’殊不能作為永久推銷的計劃。</p>
<h3>袖珍式晴雨兩用摺傘之說明</h3>
<p>— 龔星磊</p>
<p>創製摺傘之目的</p>
<p>傘為日常用具，因天氣變化無常，睛雨不測，出外行路，提携累贅，余有艦於此，故决意改革，使携者在不用時可藏儲囊中，利於行走，遂有袖珍摺傘之創製。</p>
<p>摺傘使用法</p>
<p>當傘撑用時，將滑圈外殻邊上之喫口與中隔有簧肖旋對，而後右手袖出縮內之傘柄，左手取滑圈，隨而上推，至控制滑圈彈簧止，則傘全張矣。</p>
<p>收縮時右手取傘柄，左手取滑圈，而後右手向左轉，左手向右轉，轉至不動時，滑圈向下勒，同時傘柄亦向內推，不用時將帶綑緊，而後裝入薄橡皮袋內。</p>
<p>使用法之步驟有四</p>
<p>㊀將滑圈外殻邊上之契口與中隔有簧肖旋對。</p>
<p>㊁將傘衣拓鬆。</p>
<p>㊂右手抽出縮內之傘柄，左手取滑圈，隨向上推，傘頂宜向上，至控制滑簧圈止。</p>
<p>㊃撑開後，與普通傘相仿。</p>
<p>摺傘之質料，</p>
<p>向製鋼廠定購，配傘摺用之鋼片，其性質經淬火後，外皮硬，中心仍富軔性，雖沾水亦不易銹蝕之鋼性最宜，傘柄及滑圈等，均宜用網質，可使傘輕而堅固，惟傘柄之最粗節，宜以膠木相似之質料製之使握之不滑，又增美觀，傘衣為國產之紡綢或同等性質之材料皆可。以上各件均向原料廠定製，否則工料均費。</p>
<p>摺傘之製造</p>
<p>所有各件必須用人工配合者外，餘均以機器製成之。</p>
<p>袖珍摺傘之大小及重量</p>
<p>（大型男用）取縮後之直徑可縮至一英寸半，長為九英寸三分，重為一磅，較普通之傘（上海福新廠出品）輕六兩，撑開後之大小與普通傘相等。</p>
<p>（小型女用）收縮後之直徑可縮至一英寸一分，長九英寸三分、重為九兩餘，撑開後之直為徑三十六英寸。</p>
<h3>農業衰落中之海鹽綢布（下）</h3>
<p>— 諸琴</p>
<p>惟該項綢布之價格，雖低廉至無可再低之程度，但因各國洋貨洋布之傾銷於我國內地農村，竟有數分一尺者，農民因貪洋貨之便宜，花樣之美觀，均羣趨購買，竟置本地土產綢布於摒棄之例。蓋土產綢布，色料平淡，織法繁煩，故年來受洋布市塲之影響，該處農民已有放棄不織之概矣。</p>
<p>任君又云：願投資農村，提倡國貸綢布，於該地創立一模範之織綢廠，開發農村工業，參科學之法，以改進出品之迅速，品質之優劣，花樣之美觀。則所出各種綢布等，必能期日發達，數年之後，不難為國產綢布中之鐵軍云。</p>
<p>綜觀上述情形，整個海鹽農村副業綢布之發展，已漸入衰落之途徑，同時外貨洋布之威脅，使該地土織綢布，已無發展之可能。誠然，我政府當局，及該地領袖，均應急起策謀補救辦法，且於開發我國農村工業及增加國產貨品上，俱有迫不待已之開發與製造。</p>
<h3>一心牙刷廠參觀記</h3>
<p>— 梁桐芳</p>
<p>牙刷是日常生活所必需的用具之一，因為它和人類衛生有着密切的關係，所以是不能或缺的，銷量的廣博，是不待言喻的。</p>
<p>民國十四年以前，我國市塲上銷行的牙刷，除了絕無僅有的幾種品質粗劣，式樣笨拙的手工製國貨牙刷外，盡都是舶來品牙刷每年的漏巵，是很可觀的。</p>
<p>民國十四年溫少鶴和戴至誠兩位先生，因鑒於國貨牙刷工廠的缺乏，並為提倡科學製造牙刷計，集資創設一心牙刷廠於上海南市斜橋徽寗路，現在有工人三百多名，出品以‘一心’為商標。</p>
<p>牙刷的原料是牛骨和豬鬃，豬鬃採購自四川，湖南，江西，雲南諸省，牛骨也採用國產；製造牙刷的程序，大概可分洗鬃和製骨兩部份，洗鬃是先把豬鬃用化學藥品漂洗潔白，分為粗細長短軟硬各種類，至於製骨成牙刷的手續，十分麻煩。現在約略寫在下面：先把牛腿骨鋸成牙刷長短。剖成牙刷形狀，把骨料磨光，用機器打許多穿毛用的眼孔，並在牙刷的頂端打幾個很長的立孔，這樣在穿毛時，线從立孔中穿出，不致露在外面了，這便呌暗穿法，那步工作是比較困難，其次手續便是把骨料磨切得平整圓滑，和普通用牙刷一樣，再用化學藥品漂煮五六小時，去除骨料中的毒汁，然後才穿毛，把穿好的毛切平，或者把毛的中部份切短，使頂尾凸出，這樣比較，考究，因為在刷牙時候牙刷凸出部份容易刷除齒縫中的污物食屑，暗穿的牙刷還要把立孔填沒，使线不露在外面，並須把毛夾直洗清潔，最後才把商標印在牙刷柄上，再行出光，使牙刷更加光潔，並且在裝箱出貨前，經過嚴密的檢騐手續，剔除毀損後，把製成牙刷再消毒一次，以免黏有不潔的塵污，以上所說製造手續，除了穿毛是用手工外，其他都是應用機器製成的，所以分工合作，出貨很迅速。</p>
<p>一心牙刷廠對於機製的牙刷，除注意永不脫毛外，還有很多特點：㊀利用新式機器製造，出品整齊精良。㊁採用上等的原料，品質優美。㊂工作純用有五年以上經騐的工友，因此工作效率迅速，出品也異常精巧。㊃式樣眾多，有的仿西式製造，有的自行別出心裁設計，或由牙醫生鑑定，多至五十多種，男女老幼，各有各種宜用牙刷，使用適意。㊄出品均須經過好幾次煮漂，消毒完善，經牙醫生的檢騐證明，極合衛生。㊅穿毛用暗穿法，不易脫毛藏垢，使用滑利而舒適，㊆包裝精美，封固完密，塵菌不能侵入。</p>
<p>單舉以上幾點優處，一心牌牙刷的精美實用，是值得向讀者們推薦的。</p>

<p>仍被重視的　現在我的就此整個前途和終身幸福斷送、至於絕境了、這種精神上的痛苦、實在是一個感情動物所萬難忍受、而且我手無一藝之長、教育程度、又極幼稚、毫無自力救助、醜事聲張以來、能為我臂助的、都撒手不顧了、不但終身的生活大成問題、就是目前的衣食、也毫無着落、三月六日開庭</p>

<h3>需要</h3>
<p>— （王繼華）</p>
<p>“需要”的理由在乎缺乏：富足的人用不着“需要”。</p>
<p>“需要”的先决條件在乎羨慕。</p>
<p>“需要”是人類進化史中的起點。</p>
<p>“需要”的先前必有思想，這時候一定抱着十二分的熱奮。</p>
<p>“需要”的後來就是追求，那時候的心中一定充滿着無限的希望。</p>
<p>要實現那未來“需要”的目的，必須有豐富的忍耐。</p>
<p>將近“需要”結局時，心中一定存着一種說不出的焦慮。</p>
<p>“需要”的最後結束，即是失望與得意之一。</p>
<p>“需要”並非是慾望，不合理，不應當的。</p>
<p>過度的“需要”便是貪厭不足。</p>
<h3>談標價枕綠</h3>
<p>— 枕緑</p>
<p>“四角九分”，“九角五分”，“一元九角八分”，“二元八角八分”，“四元九角五分”，……</p>
<p>走進百貨公司，瞧着那五光十色的貨物前面標價的紙片，一個個都板起了劃一不二價的臉兒，不由你不懷然感到那上面所標之價，勝如法律裁判之下的罰鍰數目或徒刊年期，這更是斷定不移，沒有抗議或上訴的餘地。</p>
<p>那些標價的數目，是那麼樣奇零怪異，各逞其不同的姿態紛紛投入顧客們的眼簾裏。顧客們日常接觸慣了却也安之若素，恬不為怪，在那浮泛的心理上只以為那確賓是他們應取的準酌妥當的數目了。可是你試略加思索，你定能發現那多數奇零的標價數目，非但不是無心偶合，恰還有不即不離地把握住顧客們心理之妙！</p>
<p>那有意减少一分半分的價目，規避徵税的定例，轉移去讨好顧客，這等丟開國民的義務而圖營業上近利的辦法暫置不議。無論如何，那奇零不整的數字可使顧客們的記憶力易於陷入寵統迷離之境，其所記得而可述說的，往住是“不足幾元”，或是“幾元有零”。但畢“二元八角八分”為例，這個價目比起那呆笨的“三元”整價所短無幾，但在人們的概括的觀念上因此可佔勝勞多多了。</p>
<p>查看篇首信筆所舉的幾個標價，那多數便足暗示其自有較高的原價得憑推算，現在是打了折扣過來所得的價目，其為真正便宜可知。</p>
<p>如果你選中了那件標價二元八角八分的貨物，而你的囊中恰有法幣三元足够交易，那你照價給付了，尚有一角二分的零找可得。這少數的‘回倉’不讓你空手縮回，足供你家去的車資或者一包香烟之價，不也是個聊勝於無的慰情之道麼？</p>
<p>這等標價的作用還孕含有人生的意義在內，推而廣之，神而明之，竟可說是無孔不入，無施弗宜的。譬如，尊嚴至於法律，也須許可一個被查抄或受破產宣告的人保留他個人生活所資的工具：卑戝至於青小，也常善意地返還幾個子留給那全身遭劫的人，不使他在深夜光身冒寒步行而歸。巧宦括地皮祗達八九分，尚剩一些為老百姓們立錐之地。江西人吃飯，總餘幾粒米屑在碗底。世情大抵如斯，這呌做“留一手”給人家，共深“有餘不盡”之思。</p>
<p>思想轉入非非：我國的外交如能採取這等的“標價方式”，庶幾其有濟乎？來一個“標價外交”，彼所謂“水鳥外交”，什麼什麼外交之類，何足道哉？</p>
<h3>導淮工段的鳥瞰涂紅霞</h3>
<p>— 涂紅霞</p>
<p>要想一償久已渴望的導淮工段之遊，在一個風和日麗，春意盎然的日子，和兩個知己的朋女，奔到了目的地。</p>
<p>在從前，這一條路是荒僻的，視在，因為導淮工程的緣故，已經比較熱鬧多了，除掉了尚未發青的樹木，也有好多來往的行人。</p>
<p>導淮，是最近最偉大的一件工程，經了兩年多的時間，幾十萬工夫的努力，入海初步的工程，尚沒有完工，據說：現在已經離最後的限期，只有兩個月了，省府和導淮的當局，準備在本年五月一日實行放水，我們認為：這件工程，的確是關係整個蘇北的水利和農業的，雖是目前消耗了許多人力和財力，可是將來的成功，是會有無限的利益的。</p>
<p>工夫們的組織是完全軍隊化，有小隊長，中隊長，總隊長，帶領工夫們很有秩序的工作，他們除掉了工作而外，餘下來的時間，大家圍坐在好像軍隊蓬帳般的蘆蓆棚裏談天，說故事，講笑話，以解除工作的疲勞。</p>
<p>當局對於他們，除掉了極力使他們生活美滿外，並且有時還集合作精神的講話，對於娛樂方面，也有音樂，電影，……一類的組織，所以：工伕們感覺得非常的舒適。</p>
<p>工伕們每人每天能够得到工資在一角至二角之間，除去了生活必須的柴火米麵的代價而外，還可餘剩三五分錢，因為他們有很多生活是非常刻苦的，米中慘雜糧煮食，下飯的小菜，多數是蘿蔔乾和生鹽。這種路大多數謀利益而寗願自己刻苦的精神，真是令人佩服。</p>
<p>當局為保護工伕們的安全，特派軍隊和各縣保安隊來擔任，分駐各地，每里路總有百十人駐紮：同時並設立診療所多處，醫藥均是所裏供給，工段的衛生，也有相當的設備。</p>
<p>貨物到了工段，因為沿途的運費和商人的貪利的原故，價目比較高昂得多了，可是一切生活的必需品，都應有盡有。</p>
<p>工段上面，差不多只有男子，很少婦女，西遊記中有女兒國，這裏大有屬男子國的風味、</p>
<p>沿河各縣的縣長和各區的區長，差不多當川在工段監督，工程的進展，固然是工伕們血汗的結晶，然而，也是他們的指揮有方呀！</p>
<p>歸途中，我在默禱這許多手胼足胝的工伕們，精神快樂！</p>
<h3>人間可哀錄（三）</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>愚向日治事之案，即在諸兒女寢室中：夜必一燈相共，笑語與書聲相應•愚案頭圖書函稿及報章之屬，往往堆積如秋山落葉，榕兒恒為我整理之。今案前窗檻上之報章一疊，雜書數積，即榕兌最後所整理者，似猶見其手爪之痕，嗟夫，今而後，吾又安忍檢讀之哉！愚每度自滬凟返，篋衍中纍纍皆稿函，向由大兒錚啟封理稿，區為數類，然後寘之案頭，俟愚選輯，大兒課忙，則每由榕兒為之，其井井有序，一如乃兄：有時見獵心喜，則亦自撰兒童常識稿件，私夾其他文稿中以進。愚選閱得之，私心竊喜。則擇其尤者，為之發刊‘兒童專刊’中，用以勉其上進，日者檢其遺物，竟於一書中發見二稿，一日‘蚌’，一日‘海膽’，一註四月用，一註五月用，蓋於休沐之日，先已寫就者。嗟夫榕兒，兒又安知不崇朝間，撤手歸去，竟不能延至四月五月之久耶！尤可痛者，比來兒所寫諸稿，悉關水族，卒致墮水而死，與水族為伍：每一念至，輕為涙零。</p>
<p>愚與大兒愛花若命，而榕亦愛之：每值種花栽樹時，輒相助為理。去冬愚於山中得一古梅椿，巨幹半已中空，殆數百年物，歸而植之巨盆中，偃蹇作縣崖狀。榕則擇其枝幹之未枯者，一一鑿之，宛然如枯幹，自饒畫意。愚大喜過望，溫語獎之，即以其他小梅椿，悉令雕鑿，亦無不中程。某日，榕見愚以破缸爿種松竹梅，因亦效顰，覓一破花盆之半，鑿作舟形，移植紫羅蘭三叢於其上，佐以片石，自然入畫。愚益喜，藏之溫室，時加灌溉。日者忍痛取視，則葉葉鮮綠，蕊將作花，亟陳之廊下，屬家人將護之，俾為永久紀念。詎翌晨出視，則中間一叢已萎：詎花亦有知，故作此慘痛之表示耶？入夏，花丁忙於藝菊，不暇他顧；榕則每於傍晚冠破草冠，履舊革履，與乃兄就汲於池，擔水灌園，往往汗被其體，水濕其褌，怡如也。嗟夫榕兒，又孰知兒平昔擔水灌園之池，即為兒今日死所耶！昔者精衛銜石，填平恨海，此池，亦吾之恨海也:姑俟兒接𤯝期過，魂兮歸來，吾將鳩工運泥，填平此萬惡之池，以謝吾兒。</p>
<p>榕兒幼即茁壯，未嘗有疾患，富膽略，能忍苦痛：頷下偶生贅肉，則㧞而去之，血涔涔然，弗顧也。一日，在校與同學作賽跑，失足路地，兩膝表皮，皆破裂如掌大，煤層嵌入肉裏，榕則自行除剔之，搽以碘酒，奇痛徹骨，歸來恐為母知，力自隱忍，厥後偶為乃母所見，憫其痛苦，加以慰藉，而榕則付之一笑而已。愚因語鳳君：此兒膽粗手辣，他日可為外科醫士，以救世而濟人。寗料其中途夭折，遽拋其慈愛之父母而去耶！</p>

<p>國器當他來的時候，已看出了他是强為歡笑。現在他告辭，也是那種强自鎮定的樣子，便不再說挽留的話，一直送到大門外去•他垂頭向巷子口上去，都是一直的走着的，到了巷子口，才回轉頭來看看。他似乎沒有料到國器還在大門口上站着的，始而是猛可的一驚•後來才停住了脚，笑着點個頭道：請回罷。他料着國器還在門口站着的，就不再回頭了。他在這一度回頭之後，似乎有了極大的感觸，人與人之間，總免不了佛家所謂的那個緣字。有緣呢？其事也好，作朋友也好，以至於男女之間的婚姻也好，一拍就合。無緣呢，無論如何親密的人，是不能作成功一件事的。國器對於夢蘭，到現在為止，還不曾交過一回言，他們倒成了可生可死的交情。由此看來，什麼也不能去强求，這裏有個緣故呢。個人和彼此有緣的人去相助一把，倒也是一件事半功倍的事。自己和夢蘭這樣好的友誼，再去和他們努一點力罷。他這樣的想着，倒像是同自己輕了一身累。就决定了次日在學堂裏會到了夢蘭一塊兒，到他家裏去，這樣拿定了主意，次日故意的早些到學常裏去，希望在沒有上堂以前，就和夢蘭有一度接洽。可是上午他沒有來，下午還是沒有來。散學之後，友梅索性夾了書包，就向江家來。一進門就遇到了小菊，他道：李小姐，你來得正好，我們小姐又病了。友梅道：又病了？那為什麼？小菊笑道：害病就害病，那裏還要為什麼呢？友梅頓了一頓，笑道：這倒是我說錯了。我就直接到他樓上去，你不要去驚動別人了。於是放輕了脚步，穿過他家幾進屋子，走上樓去。在上樓的時候，快到夢蘭屋子裏了，大意着，放重了脚步皮鞋踏着樓梯咚咚的響，這就聽到夢蘭在屋子裏道：小菊，我告訴過你，叫你不要上樓來吵我，怎麼又來了？友梅笑道：來的不是菊花，是梅花，你歡迎不歡迎。夢蘭聽說，直迎到房門口來，握住了他的手，苦笑道：我正是苦盼着你，你果然的來了。好極好極！說時，拉了他向屋子裏走來。（一五二）</p>
<h3>復興崑劇論（下）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>且就事實而論，崑劇之所以不易為人瞭解者，其故决不在詞句之深奧，而在崑劇劇本之流傳不廣，知者太鮮，因不明劇情，遂不易感覺興趣矣。譬如一般不解英語之人，亦往往嗜觀外國有聲影片，彼等何嘗能懂得劇中人之對白，無非因為先看說明書，對劇情已有充分認識，乃能領悟劇中人之表情，從而發生興趣耳。即如我輩略解美語者，以及西方一般普通人士，對於有聲影片中之歌唱，亦十九聽不明白，然興趣初未稍减也。故今日欲挽救崑劇之消亡，第一不可再以“曲高和寡”一類高調嚇人，其次必須於劇塲中分送劇詞（劇詞前並以最簡明之文字略叙全劇情節），以增聽眾興趣。</p>
<p>然崑劇之病象已深，僅此兩點，亦但能阻免更進一步之惡化而已，茍欲期其發皇光大，愚見以為尚有數點，必須注意：</p>
<p>㊀加製布景布景之足以增加觀眾興趣，已為不可否認之事實，例如牡丹亭之遊園，雖唱詞表情俱已極臻美妙，但若再能湊上一幅園景，則其動人必又倍屣矣！</p>
<p>㊁刪除雜劇崑劇中亦非齣齣俱有精采，如打陳差，打花鼓，大小騙等，可謂無聊已極，最足予觀眾以不良之印象，應一概刪去不演。</p>
<p>㊂演習新戲予嘗讀“笙翁十種曲”“遏雲閣曲譜”“玉獅堂傳奇”等，深覺儘有無數極佳之劇，猶未經今日各崑班搬演，今後研究斯道者似應不憚微勞，多習新戲，藉補今日偏枯之弊。</p>
<p>㊃增美音樂崑劇向以海笛伴奏，稍嫌單調，宜以笙，簫，月琴，琶琵等伴奏，則諸音交響，必有百聽不厭之妙矣。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>再談西班牙內戰</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>西班牙內戰，截至現在為止，法西斯派方面，還不能將馬德里全部佔領，政府軍完全剷除，不能算佔絕對的勝利，再進－步說，可算是‘失風’，因為西班牙叛軍揭竿起事時，聲勢洶洶，風馳飚舉，大有滅此朝食之概，但迄今已逾多時，而雙方倐勝倐敗，此起彼仆，大有相持不下之勢，此種力量，一方面天然並非弗朗哥將軍的力量，而又一方面，亦非政府軍之力量，故此次弗朗哥將軍之成功，非弗朗哥將軍之成功，是法西斯派之成功，弗朗哥將軍之失敗，非弗朗哥將軍之失敗，是法西斯派之失敗。</p>
<p>‘打哭小孩，大人山塲，’此種局面，本有演成世界大戰的可能，但到現在所以還未演成世界大戰者，實乃時機未熟故耳，因為自歐洲大戰，各國痛定思痛，未免寒心，兼之原氣已傷，急須休養生息，故對軍事方面，未曾有積極的準備，而獨德意兩國，整軍經武，埋頭苦幹，迄於去年，雖不能說有絕對的軍事準備，但已有相當的軍事準備，故一旦德國重整軍備，討還失地，意國遠征阿比西尼亞，幾致英法諸國，手足無措，故此次西班牙之役，所以未成演成第二次世界大戰者，其原因即在於此。</p>
<p>非法西斯派，對於法西斯派，其態度雖十分軟弱，不敢積極裁制，但此次西班牙內戰，實為兩方比較武藝誰高誰下的一個絕好區域，法西斯派用最近代化的武器，充分的軍隊，帮忙叛軍，但截至現在，政府軍勝利的情報，還時時傳來，則法西斯派的力量，亦可想而知，而非法西斯派，亦尚有相當的力量，惟非法西斯方面，所以審慎出此者，設或戰事擴大，不免世界盡遭荼毒，此種代價，寶無可限量，故不得不出於忍耐態度，而另一原因，萬一戰事發生，尚沒有得到絕對勝利的把握，故一面拼命擴軍，一面敷衍遷就，其形勢一時未趨於極端嚴重者，其幾又在於此。</p>
<p>但在法西斯派方面，認定非法西斯派的態度軟化，决不敢與之破裂，因此耀武揚威，自由行動，知時機固不可失也。萬一非法西斯派軍事有準備，聯合幾一致，即絕無發展之餘地矣，故苟能引起世界大戰的可能性，不僅此次西班牙為然，即九一八之役，德軍開進來茵河之役，阿比西尼亞之役，均足為世界大戰的導火线，但是現在雖得幸免，總有雙方火併的一日，其日必逾趨逾近耳</p>
<h3>行船</h3>
<p>— 林蒂</p>
<p>我們的船巳經行了三天了。</p>
<p>船上滿載着沉重的貨物：烟葉，栳枳，白糖，大桶的生油，……把窄小的船雙擠得幾乎沒有空位睏覺了，船兒陷在海裏是壓得這樣沉重！</p>
<p>老金同我——我們倆已經是搭了很久的伙伴了——便靠着這行船售貨物為生。㊀沿着朦朧發青的海岸，我們一直溯上，沿途兜售我們的貨物，－直到售完為止——這便是我們全部的生活。</p>
<p>老金緩緩地划着漿，清香的浮水蓮，跟着湍急的流水滑過去了。细小的水沫，在漿下飛濺。我握着舵柄，把亦裸的大腿蹺得高高的：我們時常被盤算，籌劃，弄得死般的沉默下來了。我們的思想從沒有離開過我們的營業，怎麼樣才能把我們弄得更富有呢？生活是太苦了！</p>
<p>‘老金，××號的那一筆掛賬，已經向我們追討好幾次了，你打算怎麼樣應付呢？’</p>
<p>‘還有什麼辦法麼？我們祇有等到穀粒收成的時候了。’㊁老金寬闊的紫額上，巳經流出了許多汗珠，這時候忽然緊皺了－下。手仍不停歇的划着漿，船身是太沉重了，老金顯得好像頗吃力的樣子。</p>
<p>‘七貌：（土人的名字）去年欠下的那一百塊賒賬，我們得到法庭控告他一下。媽的，真太不成了，倉庫裏的有榖賈光了，却瞞着我們不還。’這個，老金已經提起了好幾次了。這一趟因為人家向我們迫着欠賬，他又憤怒的想起了七貌這個狡猾的傢伙了。</p>
<p>‘回來再想辦法吧，橫豎………’我不耐煩的嘟噥着，實在我也為了那一百塊——這在我們是很大的數目——而煩惱起來了。</p>
<p>接着我們都為我們的心事沉默了起來。漿打着水響的聲音，老金呼喘的聲音，在這遥阔的琦羅瓦底江上是顯得太凄凉了。船兒被浪鼓着一盪一盪的前進，藍色的天空，蓋着無垠的水面，我們的船是這樣渺小呵，為了想把貨物快點售完，再火速回轉去補充貨物，所以就是遇着了逆流，也祇有用人力苦拚了。</p>
<p>船每到了一個小村落，這在我們都是熟識的：我們把船慢慢的倚岸，招呼了一些老主顧，狹小的船，暫時是熱鬧極了。寒暄的聲音，秤物的聲音，爭論價錢的噪音，暄騰的扭成了一片。一些虛偽的客套，我門在這時都用得着了，欺謊在我們也是頂平常的事。老金把貨物都包好了，便绷着火热的臉：</p>
<p>‘××，白糖一斤，煙葉………’</p>
<p>很快的，我把賬都記進流水簿裏。我們還要趁着餘暇，奔向各處索債。剩下的，便是烧飯了，這是沒有一定的時候。一些糙米飯，一碟臭魚醬，便是我們每天的菜飯。隨則，我們又把船來開了，向着永遠跑不盡的旅途前進了。生活就是這樣無味。</p>
<p>在七八月裏，海浪是非常大的。但是我們的行船，仍得繼續下去。常常，船因浪大難進，沒有趕到預定的地方，黑夜便向我們襲來了。我們祗好把船靠近荒蕪的淺灘上，把竹桿深深的插在水裏，用蔴繩把船同竹桿縛在一起。微小的煤油燈都熄下了，因恐引人注目。在這些地方，是常會遇到强盜來劫據的；把錢物都搶光了，還會把雪亮的刀子把你刺殺，把屍體推下水中。這種慘殺，是常在這－帶扮演着的，每一個行船的人，都得預先下了戒心。靜靜兒地，我們懷着一個忐忑着的心，輪流着巡夜，夜好像是故意同我們為難似的，一刻一刻沒有聲響的爬過去。我們的腦中，演着驚人的一幕幕，樹葉被風吹落的聲音，或果子從樹中掉落了，都會把我們驚駭得發抖。船下的水淙淙的流着，繁星嵌了滿天，海茫茫，在黑暗裏發着閃光，時辰又挨近天亮了。</p>
<p>一年四季，生活在我們從沒有變異的。我們在苦難中挣扎着，時間是一年一年的滑過去了，我們仍是過着凄悶的行船生活。海浪，苦人的雨，死般的寂寞，在我們都早過倦了。</p>
<p>註一：在南洋緬甸的華僑，是有許多人過着這種行船的生活的。把貨物載到各小村落去兜售，這樣一趟又一趟，一直沒有休止。</p>
<p>註二：行船的貨商，把貨物賣給土人時，是很少得到現錢的，大半是把賑掛起來，等榖收成了後，用榖粒償還。</p>
<h3>雨</h3>
<p>— 白岩</p>
<p>橋下鑽出－雙瓜皮小艇來。船頭尾各有一個穿蓑衣，戴竹笠手拿竹篙的漢子，船撐得很快，不到兩三篙已經到我面前。船頭上的人，是那個名呌王小三的船夫，我招手問他：</p>
<p>‘這樣天氣還下河？’</p>
<p>他說：</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>‘好歹沒生意，下頭水大，自己撑一趟玩玩。’</p>
<p>他的話提起我的興致來了，我說我也一塊去，他躊躇了一下，問我有無雨衣，我說雨衣是沒有穿來，不過縱然遇雨，淋－淋也不要緊。他却搖着腦袋，另一個船夫忽然自告奮勇的說：</p>
<p>‘我去借一件蓑衣來吧？’</p>
<p>他們將船攏岸，那船夫跑進村子去，果然一會兒拿來一件蓑衣，連笠子也帶來了。</p>
<p>上船後，天色愈沉，湖上起了風，若非蓑衣，定然會怕涼。船過桃園時，沒看見那個駝背的怪老乞丐，這老頭子常令人發笑，見着學生總搖頭擺尾的念唐詩，見穿中山裝或掛斜皮帶的，便唱‘國民革命成功’。</p>
<p>船到虹橋，橋洞極低，船上人須低下頭才得過去，今年水漲得很多，竹林也浸在水里了，荷池已和湖水相連，池裏本有很大的金魚，全都走完了，五亭橋只中間最大的洞可過船，其餘許多小洞，都藏在水面以下，船夫說這全是因為雨，江潮還沒漲，所以水還是綠的，如江水灌進來，就成黃色了。</p>
<p>原來長着柳樹和桃花的堤上，現在也浸了水，湖面似較平時大了一倍，想繞過山嘴，拜訪那個入過大學，也失過戀的和尚去，但在半道中，雨便傾盆地下起來。只得中途折回。船夫問：</p>
<p>‘要不要找地方避雨？’</p>
<p>我說：</p>
<p>‘有蓑有笠，還避什麼雨？倒不如就在雨裏撑一會兒。’</p>
<p>兩個船夫都笑着說‘好’。</p>
<p>兩點打在水面，每一點都激起一大堆水泡，湖面像沸了似的，平時像一面鏡子的水，現在好像舖滿了白羽毛，在風前拂顫動。雨洒在船上，水上，笠上，都很響，只落在蓑衣上時，成為悅耳的細聲。雨很密，笠上的水也不斷地從面前淋下來，人在雨中，看一切如隔重簾，又像隔一層毛玻璃，稍遠的景物都像包在烟霧裏，回頭看迎面的藍山，已縹渺地若有若無了。</p>
<h3>踏青</h3>
<p>— 田青</p>
<p>南方的春色，绣着醉人的簾幕。</p>
<p>大概是氣候的關係，蔓草早綠遍荒郊•垂楊抽出柔茸翠綠的鞭子，在輕風裏漫舞腰肢。</p>
<p>桃花開盡了，木蘭溪的水也汎濫了。探總春水的蒼鵝，早划動金黄色的足蹼，船娘似地在水上悠游。漁翁修完了破網，重新载着四竿青竹列成的小筏，在淺水滩頭徘徊，隨時準備拋下手中的羅網，鸕驚蹲在筏頭假睡——靜聽游魚打水的聲音。年青人怨恨鸕驚的陰毒。但這就是生活的真諦，在大自然的畫面裏增添一個活生生的角色。</p>
<p>上流頭撑來的籐筏，一排排地連成小小的洲嶼，淘衣的姑娘有簰上很自然地裸露着腿和臂，輕輕搥着木杵。岸旁桃陰下的人，有意瞰視水底的行雲，却頻頻用眼角斜晲那幅天真的臉影。一下子較重的杵聲，㨪動水面的漣漪，是姑娘有意撒嬌呢？漣漪遮迷了那惹人的倒影。使那顆熱情歡樂的心，微微漾起焦急的心濤：青春的火，燒煩他的心緒，在這大自然的懷抱裏，忘記自己還是一個人………燕子在蔚藍的天蓋下，雙雙劃着銀色的弧线，用着使人不容易傲傚的步法，縱情地翩舞，啾啾唱出惜春的曲調。有時輕輕掠過水面，令人懷疑是一對殉情的蜜侶，但牠們都是來驕縱這雙雙的倩影，輕輕又飛向天邊。懷戀的人，更生無涯的羨慕和妬忌。</p>
<p>春天的一切，全含滿熱烈的生意，連墻頭的夜來香，也舒開輕柔的翠葉，孕育着一業細蕊，準備跟春光鬥艷。</p>
<p>踏青的人帶着備好供獻的禮品，打着民族的燈籠，成羣地踏上祖墳所在的山嶺。青年人挽着自己最歡洽的伴侶，在深山荒野裏縱情尋歡。南方雖然沒有雪，却有落英的繽紛，舖緋紅了原野的綠茵。鷓鴣在幽林裏含情的嗚呌，更增濃了春的情意。老年人悄悄爬上親人的墳上，剷除蓬蓬的亂草，舖平墳前的坪地，恭誠穆肅地供祭，叩拜，計算‘地理先生’所告訴的風水，這一年又該走上怎樣的運途，於是投下一串歡欣有希望的微笑，或者失望躭憂的歎息。再追溯一些先人的遺事，歎一會現今世道的是非，也順便教訓小夥子為祖先爭氣。</p>
<p>這一切童年時代的春光，在我的記憶裏，刻劃得非常鮮明活躍。但是幾年來故鄉的春色，就不為我所有了。我儘蹂踩着都市的水門汀，瞧着蠢笨的無有幼芽的街樹：這號稱為南國的地方，芳草的綠意，竟渾成疎淡的夢。</p>
<p>旖旎春光，又是踏青的時候了，我遙懷着三千里外的故鄉，追思童年踏青的情趣，更懷念父親墳頭的蓬草，曾有人來刨平否！</p>

<h3>車輛交通與路燈關係</h3>
<p>— 碩</p>
<p>新燈之特殊效用</p>
<p>路燈之良善與否。對於車輛交通之安全問題。大有關係。英國利物浦城電機工程師羅炳生氏。近為文對此問題有所論列。殊有見地。為將其要旨迻譯如下。以資關心此問題者之參考焉。</p>
<p>公共路燈之設置。原為防止馬路間之盜竊。今日除防範罪惡之發生。與促進營業外。其最大之用意厥為便利馬路交通。與增進安全而已。邇者因道路間之交通。日益繁盛。公路築造。費用不貲。但欲此項投資之得以潤益於將來。則路燈問題不得不注意及之。否則危險環生。道路不能充份使用。欲求獲利。奚如綠木以求魚耶。</p>
<p>一年中自薄暮以至拂曉之時間。所計達百分之四十五。而在此昏暗時期中。路上之車輛來往。乃佔全部交通百分之四十。除此之外。每日車輛交通之最繁盛時期。乃在夜間。其時駕駛者多已因一日間之工作疲勞。而大有影響於駕駛也。澈夜馬路上之商用車來往交通。其繁盛亦年有增加。</p>
<p>基於上述之一各項事實。夜間交通之能引起肇禍及喪生事件。極為可能。此問題之異於日間交通。亦殊顯然也。故此問題之欲求解决。在汽車車燈外。當着目於路燈。蓋車燈之與交通。萬難以求解决。甚至因車頭燈之光线眩耀而引起肇禍者。故駕駛者於駛車時往往將車燈關小也。</p>
<p>關於路燈與道路交通之安全問題。事實方面之統計。英國尚無確切之材料可尋。若在美國。則頗多可資參考者。其肇禍率因路燈問題之解决。而連帶减少者。頗不乏例可引。各地間。日間肇禍事件之發生原狀尚可保持者。夜間之肇禍事件則反增加。此外。於路燈裝置及未裝置前後。各種統計。均顯示路燈之利益。大凡有路燈之處。肇禍率可减少百分之四十一。又據事實所示。一日二十四小時內。其半數之肇禍事件乃發生於夜間者。故自裝置有效用之路燈後。安全及生命與金錢之得獲保障。甚為卓著。</p>
<p>以言英國。鄉村之道路燈光裝置。尚未能大見成效。其較著者乃在一段短短之道路中。路燈之方式殊弗一律。蓋因一段之道路間。其管理當局初非一致。以此而欲求安全。要亦甚難矣。又有在小鄉村中而欲其負担全部之路燈負担者。亦非公允。因其本地之交通初不繁盛耳。今當局以道路使用之多寡。作為負担經費之支配。始稱平允。</p>
<p>所謂適當之路燈計劃。不妨提出一談。第一吾人須知道路與物體之關係。凡欲求路面之安全者。應以物體能在路面上顯明易見為唯一條件。白晝之間。物體與其環境。及因其顏色之效率。尚作極明晣之對照。但在任何人造光之下。色澤之對比完全失效。祇有求之光明而已。即在白畫。物體之在路上者。與路面之光亮對照。所見者作黑暗而已。此則一部份因光线之方向。一部份乃由故雖道路與物體受同樣之光照者。物體亦常較道路為黑暗也。由於此項事實之表顯。故在道路光照之設備上。常欲物體受光愈少愈好。而於路面則須多為光照俾物體於光亮之路面上愈見其黑暗。</p>
<p>欲求上述理想之實現。在事實上殊非易為。但因切實研究之結果。終已獲得若干種之光源工具深切實用者。其中尤以一種用電放射之鈉燈使用更廣。此項燈光作柔和之金黃色。極易辨別。在多方面此項鈉燈可以解决路燈之困難問題。金黃之光亮可使視覺增明。因常人之眼光在此種特殊之光线下。尤見明晰也。職是之故。上述之物體與路面之對比。其明晰益見增進。就經濟上言。在與普通燈同樣之消耗下。其光亮可增加五倍之多其耐用之程度則可多三倍鉅。</p>
<p>如欲求在任何種燈照之下。而獲得最鉅大之視晰者。第一必須除其眩耀之光。如於路中懸置一網狀之反射器。而使用鈉燈者。則其光亮之收效有若白畫。則一切眩耀可覓。在道路上。人行道上一切事物咸極明晰。道路而具有如此之路燈光者。車頭燈直可廢除不用。而其安全與可靠。將無絲毫之可疑也。</p>
<h3>第二批一九三七年喜臨門小寶寶不日到申</h3>
<p>一九三七年喜臨門小寶寶汽車。自第一批到申後。轉瞬即告缺貨。良以新車構造之可靠。定價之抵廉。以及行駛與維持費用之經濟。較前尤有進步。故大受本埠汽車界歡迎。頃據該車經售商靜安寺路九九七號大陸汽車公司華經理楊漢三君云。第二批新車不日到申。爰亟為披露。以告讀者。</p>
<h3>飛機式的新汽車</h3>
<p>▲近來汽車製造上。有許多地方多已取法飛機。即就形式方面說。也頗多和近代最新式的飛機相仿彿。如圖所示。是一種法國汽車名為‘潘各脫’的。這車曾在巴黎車展中陳列。頗為一般人所注意。（Y）</p>
<h3>一年來美國汽車事業概觀（續）</h3>
<p>— 影</p>
<p>客車的銷數。事實上本年度沒有貨車的穩定。大概在美國。汽車的市塲。一年可以分做四個季節。但貨車大家知道沒有季節可分的。不拘上下半年。銷之始終是很平穩的。每一個年頭。有四五個月。大概自四月到八月。每一個月的註册數字是極端平穩的。沒有多大的上落。但到了冬季。貨車的銷數會有特別的發展的。本年度美國各廠。貨車的銷數。分配得也比往年平均得多。因為在不景氣的幾年。可以說所銷售的貨車。多數由四大車廠所製造。而小車廠不過佔極少數而已。可是今年却是例外了。因為就一般的估計的一九三六年度全美所銷售的貨車。四大車廠佔百分之八十九。而一九三五年度佔百分之九十二。所謂獨立的小車廠。本年度所以能够把他們的地位提高。一方面就因除了重稅貨車之外。更製造輕稅貨車。而本年度重稅貨車在市塲方面。競爭得比較厲害一些。大多數的貨車購買者每訂購特殊的車身。配在底盤上面。至於底盤。當然也是向貨車製造廠購買得來的。而車身由一般通常的車廠所造。其中更多是上年度試用結果。已獲得相當成績的。</p>
<p>最後我們要一說的是美國各廠。近來對於一九三七年度的製車計劃。也多半已確定了。司蒂倍克和派克完全採用最新的方法。製造新式汽車。最近而且已在市塲方面公開發售。別克車廠於本年十月的第一個星期。在茀靈脫總廠方面。召集各地經理和車商以及該廠的代表舉行過一次推銷會議。共商一九三七年度的營業政策。結果已决定在美國各地。擴充銷車的範圍。十月初期。就有若干車廠。展覽一九三七年度新車的貨標。以示明年度的新車。就照貨樣製造。至少有兩個車廠。那時已决定新車的製造的接着新車的展覽。在末後兩個月。美國各地先後在公開舉行了（完）</p>

<h3>Yang Hucheng Calls on Chiang for Instructions</h3>
<p>Reports on the troop reduction process. Yu Xuezhong Visited Zhang in Fenghua Yesterday. Han Fuqu and others Arrived in Shanghai and Immediately Transferred to Hangzhou.</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] Yang Hucheng called on Chairman Chiang at the headquarters at 11:40 this morning, reporting in detail on the troop reduction process. Chiang asked many questions. Yang also had lunch at the headquarters and left at 1:15. The Chairman decided to schedule a second conversation with Yang. A reporter visited Mr. Yang, and the chief of the confidential section, Zhou Fanbai, met with the reporter on Yang's behalf. According to Zhou, Director Yang's meeting with Chiang today lasted more than an hour and the result was extremely satisfactory. Yang plans to visit Chiang again, but the time has not yet been determined. Therefore, he must stay in Hangzhou for another day or two before going to Shanghai to take a plane back to Shaanxi. He will not stop in Nanjing and has decided to cancel his trip to Fenghua to visit Zhang Xueliang. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] Yu Juchong crossed the river from Hangzhou to Fenghua Xikou at 8:00 this morning to visit Zhang Xueliang, accompanied by Wang Shihe and Yang Yuxun. They arrived at 2:00 PM and plan to return to Hangzhou that evening to call on Chairman Chiang. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Han Fuqu, Liu Zhi, and Ge Guangting took the night train to Shanghai on the 30th and will immediately transfer to Hangzhou to call on Chairman Chiang. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] Fan Songfu arrived in Hangzhou last night and called on Chairman Chiang to report on the recent situation in the Northwest and ask for instructions. He will leave soon to return west. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] Yu Xuezhong crossed the river on the morning of the 30th to Fenghua to visit Zhang Xueliang. He may return to Hangzhou that evening or on the 31st. Yang Hucheng, accompanied by Song Ziwen, continued to visit Chairman Chiang at the headquarters at 9:00 AM on the 30th to ask for instructions and reported in detail on the handling of the aftermath in Shaanxi. The discussion lasted a long time, and Chiang kept them for lunch. They left at 1:00 PM and returned to the Central Bank. Immediately after, they went out to take a bath. When reporters went to the Central Bank to request an interview, Yang had not returned. According to his secretary, Zhou Fanbai, Yang will visit Chiang again on the 31st and then meet with the press to discuss everything. Yang's meeting with Chairman Chiang went very well. Yang currently has no intention of going to Fenghua to meet Zhang Xueliang. After visiting Chiang for instructions, he plans to leave Hangzhou for Shanghai in the next few days and fly back to Xi'an. He will not stop in Nanjing. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] Yang Hucheng and Li Zhigang visited Shao Lizi at 3:00 PM today. They plan to visit Chairman Chiang for a second time tomorrow morning. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] Yu Xuezhong is scheduled to return to Hangzhou from Fenghua tomorrow. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Lu, Han Fuqu, accompanied by advisors Ge Jinzhang, Wen Chenglie, Military Affairs Academy Councilor Yao Yijia, Lu Province Committee Member Zhang Yue, and Deputy Chief of Staff Xiong Bin, who represents Chairman Chiang in paying respects to the war dead in Suiyuan, arrived in Nanjing by train at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th. Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, Military Affairs Commission Councilor Jiang Bocheng, Jiaoji Railway Superintendent Ge Guangting, and Han's representative in Nanjing, Tang Xiang, welcomed them at the station. After crossing the river, Han rode with Minister He to his office on Ningxia Road for a rest. Then, he had a long conversation with He. According to Han's associates, he was summoned by Chairman Chiang, and because Han had been busy with official duties since Chiang returned to Nanjing from Xi'an, he had not yet paid his respects.

<h3>Suzhou Murder Case: Two Elderly Women Chopped to Death</h3>
<p>Housewife and Maidservant Both 73 Years Old, Thug Commits Murder and Robs Three Gold Rings</p>
<p>[Suzhou] In Suzhou, inside the Xu Shilin Righteous Burial Ground (address number 87) across from the police substation in Qiaosikong Lane in Yanmen City, there was a resident named Xu Pan, 73 years old, who employed a maidservant named Pan Wang, also 73 years old. At around 1:00 PM today, a thug armed with a sharp axe broke into Xu Pan's house. At that time, the maidservant Pan Wang was also in the room. Without asking any questions, the thug immediately used the sharp axe to violently chop Xu Pan's head several times, and then chopped Pan Wang's head several times as well. Xu Pan and Pan Wang suffered serious injuries on the spot and collapsed to the ground, dying immediately. The thug saw that Xu Pan was wearing three gold rings on her left hand, so he raised the axe and chopped off her three fingers, stole the gold rings, and fled outside, disappearing without a trace. Later, her granddaughter-in-law, Xu Qin, returned home from outside, entered the room, and discovered the incident. She immediately reported it to the police station in charge. Upon receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched detectives to investigate the scene in order to track down the fugitive murderer. (30th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Revival of the Battleship and Big Gun Policy</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>After the expiration of both the Washington Naval Treaty and the London Naval Treaty at the end of last year, various countries began a major arms race this year. US President Roosevelt has already submitted to Congress a message with a huge national defense budget in the new year. In addition to passing a huge military expenditure, the British Parliament has also approved the issuance of huge national defense bonds. Japan in the Far East is also implementing its third naval replenishment plan this year. It is planned to build a huge 600,000 tons of warships within ten years. Other countries such as France, Italy, Germany, and the Soviet Union are naturally catching up, not letting the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan be uniquely beautiful in front.</p>
<p>Although the major arms race of various countries began after the expiration of the naval treaty at the end of last year, the policy of battleships and big guns has been revived only recently after Japan refused to join the regulations restricting the maximum gun caliber. Originally, although the London Naval Conference last year did not agree on the quantitative restrictions on the navies of various countries due to Japan's withdrawal, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France agreed on local qualitative restrictions afterward, that is, the maximum caliber of the 35,000-ton battleship armed gun should be limited to 14 inches. However, this restriction stipulated that it could only take effect after other naval powers also accepted it. Therefore, since December last year, the United Kingdom has been vigorously encouraging Japan to join the new agreement, and hoped that Japan could issue a satisfactory reply before the end of April. But now Japan has formally refused to join the regulations restricting the maximum gun diameter to 14 inches on the 27th.</p>
<p>Due to Japan's refusal to join, this qualitative restriction naturally became invalid. Because no naval power is willing to see its naval combat power inferior to that of other countries. According to foreign news, the United States has decided to install 16-inch heavy guns on the two battleships that will begin construction this summer. At the same time, the British side is also preparing to build battleships over 35,000 tons. From then on, the policy of big guns and battleships from more than ten years ago will be revived again.</p>
<p>Japan's reason for refusing to participate in the new London Naval Treaty is that it refers to the fact that there are only qualitative restrictions and no quantitative restrictions, which fundamentally violates the spirit of arms reduction. On the surface, this statement has considerable justification. Because quantitative restrictions on armaments are as important as qualitative restrictions, and even more important than qualitative restrictions. And now the new London Naval Treaty ignores quantitative restrictions and only stipulates a part of qualitative restrictions (in a broad sense, qualitative restrictions should include the abolition of aggressive weapons such as heavy guns, battleships, bombers, and poison gas). This naturally cannot be considered the true spirit of arms reduction. However, we have to say back. Although this part of the qualitative restriction method cannot satisfy people, it is better than no restriction at all. At the same time, we must also point out that the reason why the London Naval Conference last year failed to agree on quantitative restriction methods was because Japan was holding on to its policy of outward expansion and insisted on the principle of parity, and even withdrew from the conference, which led to the complete failure of the conference. Now Japan is saying that the restriction method agreed upon by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France only emphasizes quality and does not consider quantity. This truly fully demonstrates the self-deceiving attitude of aggressionism.</p>
<p>Now the maritime arms race has actively begun in terms of quantity and quality. Although the famous reporter Warner said in the New York People's Voice Forum that the United States is still willing to abide by quantitative restrictions and earnestly hopes that the United Kingdom will initiate negotiations and re-sign a new treaty. Although the United Kingdom has appointed arms reduction expert Craigie as the ambassador to Japan and is traveling to Tokyo via the United States to take office, preparing to take the opportunity to reopen naval reduction negotiations, it is inevitable that the arms reduction envoys will encounter a nose of ashes in this world shrouded in gunpowder.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan</h3>
<p>Remarkable and Impressive Achievements: Rapid Development in Agriculture and Industry; Entire Plan to be Completed by the End of This Year</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union recently released a report outlining the results of the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan in the past year and the progress of various economic construction projects this year. The report stated that in 1936, heavy industry and food production both saw significant increases, as did cotton harvests. Railway construction and transportation also experienced substantial development, and general wages have increased, along with the number of employees. However, forestry, coal, oil, and inland river shipping experienced slower development due to the sabotage of the Trotskyists. The report then outlined the various programs to be implemented by various sectors of the national economy this year, and stated that based on the current situation, it is expected that the targets set by the Second Five-Year Plan will not only be achieved by the end of this year, but also surpassed. (Central News Agency, Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] According to a report released today by the Central Executive Committee, the Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan is expected to be completed satisfactorily this year. According to the report, industrial output in 1936 increased by 28.4% compared to the previous year, far exceeding the expected 23%. Furthermore, although the southwest suffered severe drought this year, agricultural production was still very abundant, and cotton production in particular exceeded expectations. Railway projects have also exceeded planned targets, but coal, oil, and other industries have not yet reached their planned figures. The value of industrial products planned for 1937 is 103 billion rubles. In addition, it is planned to construct hundreds of miles of railways, several power plants, and a number of mining fields and oil wells. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The resolution of the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union on the 1937 Soviet National Economic Plan has been released. The content first pointed out that the basic political and economic tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan have made great achievements in 1936, and the conditions for completing the plan in 1937 have also been created.</p>
<p>Industrial production in 1936 increased by 28.4% compared to 1935, while the original plan was only to increase by 23%. Heavy industry, light industry, food, and local industries all exceeded the plan for the year. Heavy industry has also completed 98.3% of the Second Five-Year Plan. In agriculture, although the Volga region and other areas in the southeast experienced severe drought, the consolidation of collective and state farms still resulted in good results, and the large over-fulfillment of cotton harvesting quotas for the Five-Year Plan was the most important victory. Railway transportation exceeded by 8% in the year, and the railway aspect of the Five-Year Plan has been completely exceeded. The trade plan has also been exceeded, and the total trade volume has increased sharply by 30%, exceeding 10 billion rubles. The income of workers and employees has also increased, and the number of people employed has increased by one million last year.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the resolution also pointed out the shortcomings in the development of the national economy, such as the lagging technical transformation of light industry, the timber industry, and waterway transportation, and the failure of coal mining, oil, and other industries to complete their plans. It also stated that the sabotage activities of Japanese, German, and special agent spies uncovered last year in industry and transportation caused great losses to the development of the national economy. 'At the same time, their inability to hinder the rapid growth of the socialist economy proves that our organizational structure is better and more serious in the struggle against anti-Soviet forces. We will surely achieve greater success.' The resolution declares that eliminating the above shortcomings is a necessary condition for completing the 1937 national economic plan.</p>
<p>The resolution then announced that the total value of industrial production in 1937 should be 103 billion rubles, an increase of 20% compared to last year, of which heavy industry and national defense industry account for more than 40 billion rubles, light industry accounts for more than 10 billion rubles, and the food industry accounts for about 11.5 billion rubles.</p>
<p>This year's plan stipulates that the electricity production target is 40.5 billion kilowatt-hours, coal is over 150 million tons, oil is over 32 million tons, pig iron is over 16 million tons, steel is over 20 million tons, copper is 145,000 tons, lathes are 41,000 units, locomotives are 1,900 units, railway cars are 44,000 units, tractors are many units with a total horsepower of 2.59 million, combine harvesters are 55,000 units, cars are 220,000 units, bicycles are 900,000 units, phonographs are 1 million units, cotton fabrics are over 4 billion meters, meat is 800,000 tons, sugar is 2.6 million tons, and bread is 17 million tons.</p>
<p>The plan stipulates that compared with last year, industrial labor productivity should increase by 19.5%, increase income by 5.6%, and reduce industrial production costs by more than 3%. The capital construction expenditure in the industrial sector is 13.926 billion rubles. The plan stipulates that many new power plants should be completed this year, with a total generating capacity of 1,469,000 kilowatts, 16 coal mines with a total output of 7,470,000 tons, and 23 new coal mines with a total output of 21.5 million tons. In addition, 2,100 new oil wells, 8 oil refineries, 5 iron smelting furnaces, 10 hot bed steelmaking furnaces, 3 Bessemer steelmaking plants, 14 iron rolling mills, the first part of the Balkhash copper smelting complex, the entire Buriat copper and sulfur smelting complex, the entire Ural aluminum plant, and 2 ore washing plants should be put into operation. In addition, the Stalin Automobile Factory should increase its output to 100,000 cargo trucks and 15,000 cars, and the Molotov Automobile Factory should increase its output to 200,000 cargo trucks and 50,000 cars.</p>
<p>In the timber industry, the output of various paper mills should increase by 151,000 tons, and the output of celluloid factories should increase by 20,000 tons. Many new paper mills and celluloid factories should be established, and about 1,000 kilometers of timber transportation railways should be constructed. In the light industry, various yarn mills should increase spindles by 450,000, and two linen yarn complexes and one rayon factory should be established. Other factories and plants should also be built in several locations. In the food industry, two meat processing complexes, one fishing complex, several refrigeration plants, two sugar factories, 19 mechanized bread factories, one alcohol factory, and various other enterprises should be established.</p>
<p>The plan stipulates that the basic task in agriculture is to improve labor organization methods based on the experience of agricultural Stakhanovite movement participants, to make 100% use of agricultural technology and equipment, and to introduce excellent agricultural technology to achieve a sharp increase in the yield of all crops. Within this year, 612 new machine-tractor stations should be added, and 66,000 tractors should be added, with a total horsepower of 1,829,900. 55,000 combine harvesters and hundreds of thousands of other machines should be added. This year, the grain harvest should be 661.3 million poods, cotton should be over 46 million poods, flax should be 8.3 million poods, and sugar beets should be 245 million quintals. The capital construction expenditure in the agricultural sector is 2.614 billion rubles.</p>
<p>On the railway side, the average daily loading of wagons should be 95,000 (86,000 last year), and the total freight volume should be 565 million tons. The capital construction is planned to be 5.553 billion rubles. New railways opened to traffic should be 1,167 kilometers, double-track railways should be 1,104 kilometers, and electrified railways should be 561 kilometers.</p>

Housing construction projects should exceed 2.5 billion rubles. Water plants should be built in 17 cities, and sewage systems should be added in 10 cities.</p>
<p>The number of students in primary and secondary schools should reach 30,033,000 (27,418,000 last year), and the number of children in kindergartens should be 1,279,000 (1,030,000 last year). 930 new schools should be built in various cities, with 528,000 new students enrolled.</p>
<p>This year's health expenditure should be 752.8 million rubles (580.3 million rubles last year). The capital construction cost for this project is 1 billion rubles.</p>
<p>The expenses of scientific institutions should be 92.4 million rubles (79.7 million rubles last year), of which 24.5 million rubles are used for capital construction.</p>
<p>Nine new theaters and 56 cinemas should be opened this year, and 5,945 movie projectors should be installed.</p>

<p>The resolution finally pointed out that the completion of the 1937 plan will enable the Second Five-Year Plan to not only complete but also exceed the entire industry and other basic tasks. (TASS, 30th)</p>
<h3>U.S. New Deal Laws: Three Upheld by Supreme Court as Legal</h3>
<p>Minimum Wage Law for Women Workers: Ruled Valid by One Vote</p>
<p>[Washington] The Supreme Court today ruled that three New Deal laws are constitutional. Two are federal laws, and one is a law of the State of Washington. All are of great importance to the New Deal's social and economic programs. The first is the Farm Mortgage Moratorium Act, which allows farmers to retain their collateral for up to three years while adjusting their debts. The third is the Railway Labor Act of 1934, which stipulates that workers have the right to organize unions and negotiate with employers. The third is the Washington State law stipulating a minimum wage for women workers. The rulings on the first and second cases were unanimous among all judges. The third case was decided by a ratio of five to four. Previously, the New York State unemployment law also had the same minimum wage provision, but the court did not pass it. This time, Judge Roberts changed his attitude, so the proponents were able to obtain a majority. The dissenting opinion was issued by Judge Sutherland, whose words were similar to responding to President Roosevelt's proposal to reform the judicial system. He said, 'Changes in economic conditions cannot change the meaning of the Constitution.' (National Telegram, 29th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Delegation Arrives in London</h3>
<p>To Attend International Sugar Conference</p>
<p>[London] The International Sugar Conference is scheduled to open in London in April and May. The U.S. delegation led by Davis arrived here today. News article reporter Jordan recently published an article stating that Davis will take this opportunity to discuss with the British government the issue of establishing an economic understanding between Britain, France, and the United States. According to reports, U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt, had previously held talks with French Prime Minister Blum in Paris, during which he discussed the issues of reducing tariff barriers among the three major democratic countries of Britain, France, and the United States, and establishing a political understanding to safeguard peace. However, the British government believes that this plan conflicts with the Ottawa Imperial Agreement, so it does not quite agree with it. When British Trade Minister Runciman visited the United States and met with President Roosevelt, he explained Britain's position to Britain. (Central News Agency, Havas, 30th)</p>
<h3>Investigation Report on U.S. Elementary School Explosion</h3>

<p>[Washington] The elementary school in New London, Texas, was destroyed by a boiler explosion, killing hundreds of students and teachers. The cause of the accident was investigated by the Department of Agriculture. Secretary of Agriculture Wallace recently released a report on the investigation, proving that the school's cellar was filled with natural gas. When a spark ignited the gas, it caused a major disaster. As for the source of the natural gas in the cellar, whether it leaked from the ground or was caused by improper installation of iron pipes, the report did not specify.

<h3>Atmosphere of Parliamentary Dissolution Thickens: Japanese Political Situation Chaotic</h3>
<p>Centered on Amendment to Election Law: Political Parties and Government in Secret Conflict</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Because political parties centered on the election law bill halted the deliberation of the government's proposal, the government convened an emergency cabinet meeting at 4:10 PM on the 30th. Cabinet members reported on the situation of reviewing the bill and discussed countermeasures. Minister of the Navy Mitsumasa Yonai expressed strong opinions, saying that the two major parties, the Seiyukai and Minseito, strongly demanded that the government pass the amendment to the election law and stopped the deliberation of important bills. Such facts are difficult to believe that political parties have sincerity, so they should implement dissolution under the meaning of urging political parties to reflect. However, Minister of Agriculture Yamazaki and Minister of Communications Kodama and others advocated prudence, saying that the arguments of the political parties are not unreasonable. The government must fully consider this point, and at the same time, urge the political parties to reflect. Everyone expressed their opinions, and the question of whether to dissolve is currently being discussed, so the situation is very serious. (Domei News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Seiyukai and Minseito parties are strongly hoping to pass the amendment to the election law, but the government is not actively working on it. Today, the relevant committee of the House of Peers adjourned in the morning, and the atmosphere of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties suddenly deteriorated. Today, the plenary session of the House of Representatives was convened and immediately adjourned. From 2:00 PM, Sakura, Koizumi of the Minseito party, and Matsuno, Ando of the Seiyukai party discussed the issue of promoting the bill and passing the election law. If the government's attitude towards the election law is still not to work hard to promote its passage, then the deliberation of important bills will also be stopped. Therefore, the government's attitude and the parties' handling of this matter are worthy of attention. (Domei News Agency, 30th)</p>
<h3>House of Representatives Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Poor Atmosphere in the Chamber</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The plenary session of the House of Representatives convened today from 2:20 PM and immediately adjourned. After two hours and forty minutes, it continued to convene until 5:00 PM. Masakazu Miyake of the Social Mass Party requested to speak on the progress of the proceedings, shouting,</p>
<p>The government attempts to proceed with the proceedings, extending the session by six days for this purpose, while the political parties are clamoring about the amendment of the election law and the issue of human rights abuses, and have not proceeded with deliberation. This is a loss of the authority of the parliament and can be called a complete disgrace. Moreover, when the plenary session convenes, it adjourns for such a long time, wasting time. What is the reason?</p>
<p>Speaker Tomita replied,</p>
<p>The speaker had no choice but to adjourn in order to conduct the proceedings smoothly. At this point, the proceedings began, the agenda was changed, and the 'Industrial Association Central Treasury Law Amendment' proposed by the government was discussed. After Minister Yamazaki explained the reasons for the proposal, it was entrusted to the committee.</p>
<p>The following two proposals were also urgently submitted: ㊀ Japan Fuel Industry Co., Ltd. Bill, ㊁ Artificial Petroleum Manufacturing Bill, both of which were confirmed to be resolvable according to the committee's report.</p>
<p>Next, the government's 'Department Store Bill' was proposed. After Torakichi Oshima (Minseito) and the Minister of Commerce asked and answered questions, Koichi Tsuru (Seiyukai) questioned the Ministers of the Army and Navy, saying that according to the recent claims of the military, the countryside is the reservoir of national defense, so the poverty of the countryside will cause defects in national defense. Why is there no mention of small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists?</p>
<p>The Minister of Commerce gave a brief reply, and the military ministers did not answer.</p>
<p>Next, after Kosaku Maeda asked and answered questions with the Minister of Commerce regarding the establishment of department store tax, it was entrusted to the committee. The following two proposals were also confirmed to be resolvable with supplementary resolutions added by each faction: ㊀ Seafarers Law Amendment, ㊁ Japan Wireless Telegraph Co., Ltd. Law Amendment.</p>
<p>At this time, Sakichi Hattori of the Minseito party moved to change the agenda in order to deliberate on the bills proposed by the members.</p>
<p>Speaker Tomita rose and said——</p>
<p>Regarding the change of agenda, it is being negotiated with the government. Please wait for the time being.</p>
<p>At that time, the atmosphere in the chamber seemed to be poor. The government also did not agree. After the clerks came and went, the speaker announced an adjournment, which was already 6:39 PM. (Domei News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The important bill for this Diet session, the next fiscal year's budget, was formally established after passing the House of Peers on the 29th. However, although the Diet session has been extended by the government for six days, there are only two days left now, and 44 government bills have not yet been established. Among them are important laws such as the Iron and Steel Business Law and the Export Control Tax Law, which may be difficult to deliberate on in this short period of time. Therefore, from all aspects of observation, the government must extend the session by one more day. Government officials also recognize the need to extend the session. (Domei News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Ikeda Seihin, President of the Bank of Japan, visited Prime Minister Hayashi on the evening of the 29th and had a conversation for more than an hour. President Ikeda explained the current state of the financial world in detail. Prime Minister Hayashi originally planned to implement the current cabinet's independent policies after the end of the Diet session. Therefore, he listened to the Minister of Finance's report on the situation of the economy and the financial world, and listened to various opinions from President Ikeda to establish a reference for policy.

<h3>U.S. Decides to Proceed with Supplementary Shipbuilding Plan</h3>
<p>Large Navy Faction's Plan Shelved: British Newspaper Comments on Naval Competition</p>
<p>[Washington] According to today's news, senior U.S. naval officers have decided on a shipbuilding plan to temporarily maintain the principle of supplementing at any time, regardless of the actions of other countries. The plan proposed by the large navy faction to add ten cruisers has been shelved. Secretary of the Navy Swanson also agreed with this claim in order to avoid repeating the mistake of having a large number of destroyers becoming obsolete after the European War. It is reported that the Navy may build the U.S. Navy to the limit permitted by the treaty by 1942 in accordance with the Queen Delaware Act passed by Congress, and build two battleships this year. Although Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Leahy, has stated that the U.S. Navy has decided to maintain its strength equal to that of any country, the British naval expansion plan may cause the U.S. to increase its construction of warships. However, judging from the situation, the U.S. may still adhere to the original plan. Naval officers expressed that they are not surprised by the British seven-year shipbuilding plan. However, this decision does not mean that there is still hope for various countries to conclude a naval treaty within one or two years. Officially, no news of convening a naval conference has been heard. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>[London] The Japanese government recently notified Britain that it refused to accept the battleship gun diameter limit (i.e., 14 inches) stipulated in the 1936 London Naval Treaty. The Times recently commented on this matter with rather harsh words, stating that 'if the caliber of battleship guns is changed from the 14 inches stipulated by the London Treaty to 16 inches in the future, the naval arms race will start again. Whether this competition can be avoided is in the hands of Japan. Although the country withdrew from the naval conference midway last year, if it can accept the 14-inch gun diameter limit before April 1, the naval arms race can be saved. Otherwise, countries around the world will inevitably expand their navies without limit and recklessly. Who is responsible for this? There is no doubt about it.'

<p>⊙Hengtai  It was learned here today that an unstable situation had occurred on the Spanish rebel side. However, the plot was not well-concealed and was uncovered by the rebel authorities. Approximately one hundred officers and soldiers have been executed by firing squad, half of whom were executed in Morocco. The reason for this defection on the rebel side is said to be that General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the rebels, intended to cede command of the army to Italian officers. Rebel officers and soldiers, feeling humiliated by the defeat at Guadalajara, blamed the Italian troops for it and were dissatisfied, so they considered rebellion and plotted to assassinate Franco and release government prisoners. There are still hundreds of people in custody, and the case was solved by German spies. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>⊙Tangier  According to news obtained here today, thirty soldiers serving at the Tetuan airfield in Spanish Morocco were all shot on the 24th of this month.

<h3>Italian Troops Massacre People in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Affecting Many Italians; U.S. Embassy to be Closed</p>
<p>[London]  After General Graziani, the Italian Governor of Abyssinia, was ambushed by natives in Addis Ababa on the 19th of last month, a portion of the Italian garrison immediately carried out a large-scale massacre in the city as retaliation. According to The Times, after General Graziani learned of this retaliatory action, he immediately ordered two hundred of his soldiers to be sent back to their home country. It is also reported that the Italian troops were indiscriminately slaughtering people, and several Italians in the area were even shot and killed, demonstrating the brutality of the massacre. Since this tragedy occurred, trade relations between Abyssinia and other countries have been suspended. The companies operated by British and Indian merchants, as well as Belgian banks, have been closed. It is heard that the intention of the Italian policy is to force all non-Italian-operated stores in the two countries to close within a few months. In addition, the two sons of Dr. Martin, the Abyssinian minister to England, were recently executed by firing squad in Addis Ababa on suspicion of plotting to assassinate General Graziani.

<p>[Rome]  The U.S. Consul in Addis Ababa, Mr. Heath,</p>
<p>has completely closed the U.S. diplomatic mission in Abyssinia today and is preparing to go to Djibouti this week. The U.S. Embassy will be officially closed this Wednesday. In the future, the interests of the American people in Abyssinia will be jointly managed by the U.S. Embassy in Italy. Italian people are quite surprised by this move, as they believed that the United States would follow Britain's example and still establish a consulate in Addis Ababa. However, the Italian government must recognize the Italian king as the Emperor of Abyssinia before it can recognize Heath's consular qualifications. The State Department naturally refused, so Heath is temporarily only using a regular tourist passport in Abyssinia. As for the former U.S. Minister to Abyssinia, Mr. Engert, he is currently staying in Naples, Italy, for a few days before departing for the United States. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Naval Commissioner Measures Tanggu Port</h3>
<p>Nomura Appointed to be in Charge, Coming to Handle Matters; Eastern Development Invests in the Development of North China's Economy</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Okano, Commander of the 14th Destroyer Division of the Japanese Ryojun Naval Port, arrived in Tianjin on the destroyer "Ogi" at 7:00 PM on the 29th, berthing at the Dalian pier in Special District No. 3. On the morning of the 30th, he will, along with Captain Iwashita and all the officers and men of the ship, land to visit the shrine, and visit Tasiro, Commander of the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin, and Kubota, the naval attache in Tianjin. The ship sailed from Ryojun on the 27th, arrived in Tanggu on the 28th, and is scheduled to stay in Tianjin for four days. On April 2nd, it will sail to Tanggu again, berth for one day, and then sail back to Ryojun. Regarding the Japanese plan to construct Dagu and Tanggu into primary and secondary seaports, since strengthening the Headquarters of the North China Garrison Army, they have sent hydraulic expert Sakamoto to China to survey and prepare a plan to be submitted to the Japanese Military Department. The Japanese Military Department then decided to hand it over to the naval authorities for re-evaluation, as preparation for construction, and specifically ordered Nomura, the 3rd Section Chief of the Naval General Staff, and his staff member Nakamura to fly to Pingjin on April 1. That afternoon, they will arrive in Tianjin, and together with Kubota, the naval attache in Tianjin, and Kobetsu, the naval attache in Pingjin, take the destroyer 'Ogi' to Tanggu to measure the harbor mouth, and return to Tianjin on April 2. They will then consult with Tasiro, Hashimoto, and the naval attaches stationed in Pingjin to exchange harbor construction opinions, and then travel to the Northeast to meet with Tojo, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, to hear their intentions before returning to Japan to report. How the project will be implemented in the future, the highest Japanese military department will take Nomura's report as the guideline.</p>
<p>In addition to planning to construct the Tanggu and Dagu ports, Japan also plans to build the Daqing River Estuary in the puppet Jidong area as a free trade port or a port for both military and commercial use. The river mouth was designated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen as one of the three major northern ports. The Japanese naval authorities have long paid attention to the area and measured it many times last year, believing that the shape and water volume meet the conditions for port construction. Only the location is not as important as the Tanggu and Dagu ports, and the situation of holding the throat of Pingjin, but in the Luandong area, it occupies a special position as an import and export outlet. Therefore, they advocate its development. Recently, after contacting the puppet Jidong government, the puppet side has also agreed to the construction. However, due to funding issues, it will first be developed as a trading port, to be used as a port for unloading smuggled goods. A highway is planned to be built first from Tangshan to the river mouth to facilitate transportation. If the port is officially built, a railway line will be built along the highway route. This time, Nomura will come to Tianjin and will visit the area after measuring the Tanggu and Dagu ports.</p>
<p>Ikeda, Chief of the Third Section of the Japanese Army Headquarters stationed in North China, will return to Japan to activate economic development funds in North China and is scheduled to return to Tianjin in early April. The Japanese Army Headquarters has only two ways to raise capital for the restoration of the Longyan Iron Mine and the construction of the Jinshi Road: one is to transfer 24 million yuan from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' fund for cultural undertakings in China, with 10 million yuan for the restoration of the Longyan Mine and 14 million yuan for the construction of the Jinshi Railway; the other is to draw out the Oriental Development Company for cooperation and invest capital. After Ikeda returned to China to negotiate the former method, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected it, determining that the fund for cultural undertakings in China is specifically for cultural undertakings in China, and its importance is no less than economic development issues. Once transferred, all cultural matters in China would be suspended. Therefore, the Japanese Army Headquarters was asked not to transfer it. After Ikeda negotiated the latter method, a report has arrived in Tianjin, stating that the Oriental Development Company has agreed, and its president, Yasukawa Yunosuke, may come north in the near future, and the Japanese Army Headquarters will guide the investigation. It is said that the Oriental Development Company plans to invest about 25 million yuan. If this can be done, then the priority plans of the Japanese Army Headquarters to restore the Longyan Mine and build the Jinshi Road will all be realized. As for the Jinshi Railway, the Japanese side had intended to reduce it to the Cangshi Road in order to save construction costs. Recently, because the Tanggu harbor construction project is also in the plan, in order to obtain land and water connections to achieve its long-term plan to control North China, it has decided to build the Jinshi route as originally planned.

<h3>Bandit Leader Fang Buzhou of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Border Area Surrenders to the National Army</h3>
<p>You Guocai Reports Victory from Southern Hubei by Telegram to Hankou</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The bandit leaders Chuan Qiutao and Fang Buzhou have kidnapped bandit crowds and roamed the border areas of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi for several years, with Huangjindong as their main bandit nest. Since You Guocai was transferred to Hubei to serve as the commander of the Fourth Column, the 121st Division under his command, commanded by Wu Jianping, and the newly-established 8th Division, commanded by Jiang Pishu, have also been stationed in southern Hubei, engaged in searching and suppressing bandits, repeatedly inflicting heavy losses on the bandits. Bandit Chuan served as the chairman of the puppet Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Soviet Province and the political commissar of the military region headquarters. Bandit Fang served as the commander of the puppet 16th Division. In terms of official rank, Chuan was above Fang. Earlier this month, the old nest of Huangjindong was captured by the National Army. Bandit Chuan led more than 300 remnants of the puppet Independent Regiment and the Special Service Battalion, fleeing east from the nest, passing through Xiushui in Jiangxi to Tongcheng in Hubei, joining forces with the puppet 16th Division. The puppet 16th Division of Bandit Fang had been repeatedly suppressed by You's army, suffering heavy losses, and his wife was captured alive. Fang's attitude gradually became negative. After Bandit Chuan entered Hubei, he criticized Fang as right-leaning, removed Fang from his post for inspection, seized his army, and appointed his puppet chief of staff Zhang Shunxin as the acting commander of the puppet 16th Division. In Sanjietian, the bandit crowds were reorganized, incorporating the puppet Independent Regiment into the puppet 16th Division, forming the 46th and 48th Regiments and the Special Service Company directly under the division, with more than 600 rifles, two heavy machine guns, and three light machine guns, and more than 800 bandits. Ammunition and supplies were in panic. Fang fled with two pistols. On the 27th of this month, he fled to Longgang, which belongs to Yangxin, and surrendered to the Wei Regiment of the newly established 8th Division. At the same time, You's army also defeated the main force of the bandits in Hengling, Sidu Port, Zhumuwo, Yanglousi and other places belonging to Chongyang, and destroyed the bandit nest. The future of the bandits will be eliminated due to internal divisions and the fierce attack of the National Army. Yesterday, You Guocai telegraphed Hankou to report the victory. The text is as follows: (1) The remnants of the bandits in southern Hubei have been repeatedly suppressed by our 121st Division and the new 8th Division, suffering heavy losses. Now the bandit leader of the puppet 16th Division, Fang Buzhou, has surrendered to our Longgang garrison Wei Regiment today, and will be escorted to Yangxin tomorrow. After the headquarters arrives, the details will be telegraphed again. I hope it will be forwarded to the headquarters as soon as possible. Commander You Guocai felt it. (2) According to the telegram from Commander Li Yoyou, I was ordered to lead the Liu and Li Battalions and the machine special departments to reach Sidu Port before Yoyou, and in Zhumuwo, Yanglousi and other places, I copied the Soviet government and Red Army 6th Division political department bandit hospital of the puppet Hubei-Jiangxi province, more than 100 bandits, carrying dozens of guns, fleeing in two directions, one to Panshuping and the other to the border of Bixi. More than 20 bandits were captured, including a political commissar, and a new-style rifle and many printed materials were obtained, including a mobilization guide. The bandits built sheds of thatch and lived in the deep mountains, and the companies are searching for them, so that no one escapes. In addition to ordering the regimental commander to continue the search and suppression, I specifically report. (29th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Strong Men Dredge Gu Pu Pond</p>
<p>Gu Pu Pond outside the East Gate of the county is an important waterway for transportation in the western district. Due to years of siltation, the county government has convened township chiefs of various related districts and towns to discuss dredging. Now, 1,000 strong men are drawn from the first and second district offices, and the dredging will start on April 1.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Raise Funds to Dredge Xu Fen Pond River</p>
<p>The Xu Fen Pond River in the first district starts from Gaoban Bridge in the south and ends at Tongcheng Road in the north, with a total length of 480 meters. It is an important transportation route in the urban area. However, due to years of siltation, the impact is quite significant. Moreover, the north end of the river is about 45 meters away from the outer city river and does not connect to the flow. Therefore, whenever the water level is low, the river water is smelly and turbid, which is even more relevant to public health. Now the county government plans to dredge and open it to connect to the city river, and has sent personnel to measure it, and plans to use national labor service to implement the work.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Committing Suicide for Being Unable to Repay Rent</p>
<p>Shen Ruixiang, a villager in Xuetian Port, Guliu Township, First District, is forty-six years old this year. In addition to farming, he also works as a plumber. His family is poor and he owes the Education Bureau 42 yuan in rent. The Education Bureau has repeatedly sent Zhou Pinlian to urge him to collect the money, but to no avail, so he sent a letter to the police station to pursue him. The bureau sent two policemen to capture Shen. When he arrived at the new wooden bridge on the east side of Ban Jing Wan, Shen jumped into the Liuhe Pond. The river there is wide and deep, and the currents are rapid, and he was immediately submerged. The body was rolled up by the bureau with a rolling hook. After the county sent personnel to inspect it, the body was buried. The old and frail mother carried two children to the scene to ask the Education Bureau for compensation. The director agreed to give 100 yuan to settle the case.</p>

<h3>A Certain National Entered the Country Causing Disturbances</h3>
<p>At the South Gate Station on the afternoon of the 29th, a strange car suddenly came without a note. The drivers were two foreigners who spoke Japanese. The station did not stop them to avoid disputes. Unexpectedly, the foreigners took photos arbitrarily in the car, and the guards stopped them. When checking their side, there was no travel passport. It is inevitable that there will be some disputes, which is actually caused by the fact that the two sides do not understand each other's language. However, the audience gathered more and more and followed behind. When they arrived at the South Gate, the guards saw that the crowd was disturbing and hindering traffic, so they stepped forward to disperse them. Unexpectedly, the foreigners misunderstood and involved them in the agitation, and smashed the police car. At the time, someone who knew a little Japanese and a patrol team of the garrison happened to pass by, and translated and ordered them to hand over the photos taken along the way, and then the matter was over. The Japanese also returned immediately.</p>

<p>Continued Coal Mining at Lieshan</p>
<p>The Lieshan Coal Mine in Suxian is rich in coal production. It was shut down for two years due to poor business conditions. The coal pits were flooded and could not be mined.

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Association's Movement to Reduce Textbook Prices</h3>
<p>▲ Lists Four Reasons for Price Reduction</p>
<p>▲ Sends Another Letter to the Booksellers Association to Argue Based on Reason</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Association and various educational organizations of this city, in order to reduce the burden on students, jointly requested the Ministry of Education to order the Booksellers Association in various places to reduce the selling price of textbooks, as reported in previous newspapers. The Municipal Booksellers Association once sent a letter to the Municipal Education Association stating that it could not reduce prices. The Municipal Education Association specifically listed four reasons yesterday and sent another letter to the Booksellers Association to argue. The original letter and reasons are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Sends Another Letter to the Booksellers Association to Argue Based on Reason To the point, the large letter has been read. The association previously stated that your members have increased the selling price of textbooks, hindering the popularization of education. We once sent a letter requesting that the selling price be based on the actual price without secret commissions, and that the selling price be appropriately reduced based on the cost. Unexpectedly, the reply stated that the members had reduced the list price and implemented it last year, and that the price of paper may increase again. After reading it, I felt very regretful. What is the truth about the so-called reduction? The original price was one dime, sold for six cents, and now the price of six cents is actually sold. What is the so-called reduction of half a catty or eight taels? Moreover, I heard from people in the book industry that last year's industry rebates were as high as 40% or more. This year's industry rebates are 15% in this city and 25% outside the city. The Ministry of Education ordered that the selling price be reduced. Your members not only failed to comply, but also increased it accordingly, secretly raising it by another 20%, and saying that it had been reduced last year. What was reduced? It is really confusing. The so-called increase in the price of lead printing, the increase in the price of silk, and the increase in the price of other industries are indeed facts. However, the business of other industries is clear, and the business of real industries is obscure. When the raw materials of other industries rise, they have to rise accordingly. When the raw materials of your industry rise, there is still twice the profit to be made. In other words, according to the report of Director Wu Yan of the Ministry of Education, the cost of elementary school textbooks is about four li. Even if the price of raw materials increases this year, it will be at most one cent. Proof of the facts, such as a certain bookstore in your industry that has not joined your association to jointly monopolize and profit, so the price of each textbook is only three cents at the store. The same industry adds rebates and short-term textbooks, and literacy textbooks cost raw materials. What is the difference? They only sell for one cent, and each bookstore is rushing to sell them, which shows that the price you are selling now still has a lot of profit to be made. You should consider reducing it to benefit education, and your industry's reduction of textbook prices will benefit others and not harm yourself. I have enclosed a copy of the materials obtained by this association for the reduction and sale of textbooks, and I ask you to consider it again.</p>
<p>Four points of materials to be reduced ㊀ In February 1936, the Ministry of Education issued a notice to all painting bureaus to abolish the selling price based on actual cost, and to reduce the selling price according to the cost to reduce the burden on students' parents. The bookstores published this order in the newspapers (between March, April, and May) and said that they would comply with the Ministry's order. How do they know that the booksellers actually implemented the first half of the order, but did not implement the second half of the price reduction, and instead reduced the industry rebates. Because of the Ministry of Education's order, it became a talisman for price increases. Now let's list it as follows: The list price of elementary school textbooks before July was one dime, sold at 60% off, which is six cents. The industry rebate was up to 40%, and the average was 30%. After July, the actual price was six cents. The industry rebate was 15% in this city, and the highest was 25% outside the city. ㊁ The list price of middle school textbooks before July was one yuan, and the actual price was 90% off, which is nine dimes. The industry rebate was up to 40%, and the average was 30%. After July, the actual price was nine dimes. The industry rebate was 15% in this city, and the highest was 15% outside the city. ㊁ The cost of textbooks is quite light. The cost of primary and secondary school textbooks is listed as an example on the left: (A) The third volume of the Business Elementary School Chinese uses thin kraft paper for the bottom and face, and white paper for the inside. The bottom and face account for four sides (ie two pages), and the heart accounts for seventy sides (ie thirty-five pages). Cost (1) White paper, 31 pieces, is used for a large sheet and 3/32. The current market price is five yuan per order (formerly only two yuan and three corners), which is 1.6 cents. (2) The bottom and face are made of thin kraft paper, 16 pieces, which is 1/16. The current market price is 16 yuan per order, which is one cent. (3) That is, the labor cost is one cent (printing cost is calculated at 80 cents per order, including the above number) (binding included). (4) Plate making fee is two li, editing fee is one li, and advertising fee is one li. The above costs a total of 1.8 cents per copy, and the actual selling price is 7 cents per copy. (5) The above fees are all calculated at 50,000 copies. If 500,000 to 1 million copies are printed, it will be less than this number. (B) The third volume of the Business Junior High School Chinese, (1) The bottom and face paper, nine pieces, costs three cents and three li. (2) The heart uses 70 pounds of white Daolin, one corner per pound, 14 yuan per order, counting 244 pages, each book uses four sheets of paper, costing one dime, one cent, and two li. (3) Printing cost (260 pages) is eight li. (4) The cost of typesetting (110,000 words) is two li (calculated by printing 5,000 copies). (5) The cost of editing and advertising is two li (calculated by 5,000 copies). The above costs a total of one dime, two cents, seven li, and three hairs per copy, and the current list price is nine dimes, and the actual selling price is eight dimes and one cent. According to the above calculation, not only does it violate the national government's stipulation that the interest rate should not exceed 20%, but it is now as high as 200% to 300%, which is really shocking. ㊃ Textbooks compiled by the Ministry of Education are compiled by the country, and now they also collect royalties, which is even more inappropriate and should be waived to promote popularization. ㊄ In the past, Shanghai organized literacy education. Mr. Tao Baichuan compiled the "Literacy Textbook." Various bookstores scrambled to sell it, and the result was obtained by the Business Bureau, which cost one cent per copy (at that time, the newspaper cost more than two yuan per order), which is enough to prove that the current sales of six cents, seven cents, and two is inappropriate.</p>
<h3>Municipal Social Bureau Bans Unsound Private Schools</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau, in order to rectify private schools, investigates, inspects, urges improvements, and recently found that Shangren Elementary School, Qinghua Elementary School, Ziguang Elementary School on Pinlang Road, and Tongzhi Elementary School on Tianji Road are all poorly managed. It has ordered them to close down voluntarily.</p>
<h3>Japan's Modern Science Library Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Modern Science Picture Library, which was funded by its government and organized by the Japanese in Shanghai, was established last autumn. It is located at Hongye Building, No. 149 Sichuan Road, and is named after Tatsichiro Funatsu, the managing director of the Textile Industry Association of that country in China. Kosuke Uesaki, the former deputy director of the Economic Department of the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, was appointed as the director. The magazine department was opened last winter, and the entire library was opened yesterday (30th). The Chinese and Japanese national flags were hung at the entrance to celebrate. About four to five hundred people went to see it yesterday, mostly students studying in Japan. The library currently has 10,278 books, including philosophy, history, society, nature, industry, industry, art, language, and literature. In the future, it plans to publish a Chinese-Japanese combined magazine, host academic lectures, and show science and culture films to introduce Japanese industry and academia. It is heard that Mr. Funatsu will invite people from all walks of life in this city to visit after returning to Shanghai from Japan in the near future.</p>
<h3>National Art Exhibition Opens Tomorrow</h3>

<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th The second National Art Exhibition is scheduled to officially open on the 1st. The reporter specifically visited Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education on the 30th to ask for his opinions on this National Art Exhibition. He agreed to meet and gave a very eloquent speech. The main points are as follows: ㊀ The first National Art Exhibition was held in 1929. One of the purposes of this art exhibition is to examine the degree of progress and trends of art in our country in the past eight years in order to determine the plan for promoting art education in the future. ㊁ Art matters were often regarded as the facts of a few people or the aristocratic class in the past. The more people appreciate and identify with art, the greater and faster the progress will be. The direct purpose of holding this art exhibition is to arouse the public's interest in art and aesthetic ability, in order to gradually achieve the so-called popularization of art. Indirectly, it can encourage writers to improve their future art achievements. ㊂ The country is in serious trouble and the whole country is depressed. In order to prevent the people of the whole country from being overcome by any setbacks or troubles in this depressed atmosphere, and to always maintain their positive spirit of fighting to the end for the nation and for the doctrine, it is urgent to provide all staff with proper spiritual nourishment and spiritual adjustment. The appreciation of art can expand the mind of the appreciator and calm his temperament, which is just enough to meet this need. This art exhibition is held during a period of serious national crisis, and it has its own special significance. Furthermore, the scope of this art exhibition is quite wide, including calligraphy, photography, sculpture, architecture, patterns, fine arts, crafts, rare books, and epigraphy, etc. The exhibits include not only modern works, but also historical masterpieces of various public and private collections. Ancient art from the ruins of Yin and the Dunhuang Shibo has also been selected. The National Art occupies an important position in the history of world culture. Since the London Chinese Art Exhibition was held last year, it has been universally recognized by the world. The inclusion of ancient works in the conference aims to continue to promote the government authorities, and to continue to work hard by the wealthy generation of writers to extend the glory of our ancestors to infinity.</p>

<p>—May Futures to be Open for Trading Starting on the First—</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for various months showed mixed gains and losses, with a trend of near-term weakness and long-term strength. In terms of foreign wheat quotations, during the market closure period, Chicago was still better by seven to eight jiao or so, while Canada rose by one yuan and forty-five jiao in the near term, and seven jiao in the long term. After the opening price, this month's initial opening was three yuan, nine jiao and three fen, but sales were sluggish, and the bulls retreated, immediately falling by one fen and seven li and a half. Therefore, the opening prices for July and August followed, slightly down by one fen or so. After the first trade, due to some floating short positions being covered, market sentiment stabilized, and factory owners also seized the opportunity to cover short positions, leading to a gradually improving situation, with prices rebounding by one fen and three fen from the lowest point. By the afternoon opening, this month's initial price remained stable, but later, as the bulls retreated, another factory sold short, and market sentiment gradually loosened. As for July and August, due to the cold weather, the bulls pushed up long-term prices, so the initial drop was followed by a rebound. As for the May standard, at the request of brokers and fixed clients, trading will resume on April 1st as usual. As for the trend this month, if actual sales remain inactive, the market is expected to remain flat or weak.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, at the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, prices for various months showed mixed gains and losses, while the afternoon futures showed a consistent strong trend. Although foreign wheat quotations continued to be good, ranging from seven to eight jiao to one yuan and forty-five jiao, the recent standards must depend on the flour market for direction. If northern sales are active, the wheat market will naturally follow, otherwise, given the experience of March, various parties are wary and dare not act rashly. The initial opening price for April was down by as much as one jiao and six fen due to the retreat of floating long positions. June and subsequent months also fell back by three or four fen due to near-term considerations. Later, with the absorption by northern buyers, the trend returned to strength. By the afternoon opening, the price trend for April was flat, while June and subsequent months rose by three to five fen as the flour market improved and the weather also changed. The current wheat supply is tight, and various factories are slightly eager to replenish their stocks, so various stalls have raised their prices by three to four fen. Fufeng and Shenda handled the purchase of three to four thousand bags.</p>
<p>Lian Dou Telegrams Frequent Rises</p>
<h3>Standard Soybean Oilcake Soars</h3>
<p>—Recent Oil Rises Sharply by Seven Jiao—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the standard soybean oilcake market rose unanimously. Because the Dalian market had already risen during the market closure period, and the Lian Dou telegram reported a rise of about two jiao, people in Shanghai were excited. Brokers and retail customers dared not sell, while floating short positions and new entrants were active again. The market opened sharply higher in the morning, and the buying sentiment was particularly strong as the telegrams continued to be strong in the afternoon. Although there were no wholesale channels for spot goods, market prices and sentiment had already risen. Closing prices: standard oil up seven jiao this month, four and a half to four jiao for later months; standard beans up one jiao and three or four fen; standard cake up two or three fen.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Merchants Stop Buying Ke Xian Rice, Cargo Owners Still Seek to Sell</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of Ke Xian rice from Guangdong improved, and the market weakened before stabilizing. Given the abundant harvest in various provinces along the Yangtze River last year and the ample supply in Shanghai, the market would have been difficult to stabilize. However, the Guangdong merchants were active, so they were able to support the market for half a year. Recently, the Guangdong merchants have completely stopped buying. There are rumors in the market that a large batch of foreign rice has arrived in Guangdong Province, but according to news from Guangdong Province yesterday, there are currently only a few small shipments, and wholesale shipments are still pending. However, because the Transportation and Sales Bureau, the Farmers' Foundation Bureau, and the Guangdong Provincial Regulation Committee are meeting to handle the import of one million shi of foreign rice and grains, applying for tax exemption, it may be possible. Therefore, the merchants dare not rashly buy again while their existing rice stocks have not yet been sold. With the Guangdong market stagnant, the Shanghai market immediately trended downward. Yesterday, there was active trading between local merchants and Quanzhou merchants, and the market was still able to support itself. However, cargo owners are still seeking to sell, and the outlook is not very optimistic. The total daily sales were 6,471 bags of Jiangxi rice, 340 bags of Hunan rice, and less than 2,000 bags of sales by Quanzhou merchants, with the rest being handled by local merchants.</p>
<h3>Thick and Thin Geng Rice Rebounds by One Jiao or So</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, nearly thirty shipments arrived from various sources, totaling sixty-odd dan of goods, with thick and thin Geng rice being comparable. Since the Foreign Rice Tax Exemption Petition Delegation arrived in Beijing, sentiment has stabilized somewhat. Moreover, it is heard that Xian rice markets in various provinces such as Hunan, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi have all risen, so sentiment has risen, prompting activity among urban and rural stores, and wholesale sales are also acceptable. It is estimated that Qingdao and other merchants handled more than three thousand bags of thin rice, leading to a tight situation, and the market is showing strength. The prices of thick and thin Geng rice have all risen by one jiao to beyond one jiao. However, due to unsuccessful price negotiations in the wholesale market, it is still difficult to estimate accurately. Dujian also improved by several fen. Only Yangjian and Yinbianyuan have similar supply and demand, with no gains or losses.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about thirty ships arrived from various merchants downstream. Trading in various goods was brisk on the market, with the price of top-grade white Geng rice rising by nearly one jiao, and the price of medium-grade rice rising by more than one jiao. The price of Yangdu Buxian rice rose by nearly one jiao, and the price of Yinbianyuan also tightened by several fen. The prices of other types of rice all rose by several fen to one jiao.</p>

<h3>Exchange Rate Rises, Foreign Exchange Market Tight in British, Flat in US</h3>

In the morning, overseas silver markets were quoted against the closing rates. London large-denomination forwards were flat, New York silver prices were unchanged, and the Montreaux forward silver price narrowed by five hao to one li or so.

The opening selling price for near-term British exchange was one shilling, two pence, and 0.625, and the opening price for US exchange was 29.78125 yuan, which seemed tighter for British and looser for US compared to the previous closing rates. After the opening, the market gradually flattened out, with banks showing good appetite. Therefore, although Xiaoluson and Sassoon were sellers, HSBC posted the same British and American rates, and the silver balance tax remained unchanged. The intermediate process was still flat, and the same was true at midday. In the afternoon market, the US dollar continued to be weak. Banks took advantage of the low prices to maintain their positions, which was still supportable. Foreign firms also had some appetite, and the shilling weakened slightly, with similar results. The closing selling prices for near-term British exchange were one shilling, two pence, and 0.625, and the closing price for US exchange was 29.78125 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, the British exchange was slightly weaker, while the US dollar was flat. Sassoon Xinfeng slightly sold shillings. Here is a record of the day's transactions:</p>

<h3>Securities: March Government Bond Delivery and Its Process</h3>
<p>Large Accounts Absorb, Market Price Turns From Low to High: Delivery Amount 8,085,000</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Huashang Securities Exchange was the delivery date for March futures, and the market remained closed for one day. The total delivery amount was 22,890,000, of which 14,805,000 was settled through account transfers by brokers themselves, and 8,085,000 was delivered at the exchange. The surface delivery quantity was not large, but the quantity delivered off-exchange must have been large. The process of the market price for Type A bonds was uniquely sluggish. Because this time, 3.5 million yuan worth of Type A bonds were delivered for number 35, and number 20 received the most deliveries. The market price process lasted for a total of 39 days, including the Lunar New Year holiday. The initial market price for Type C bonds was only 62 yuan, and Type A bonds were 72 yuan when the March futures began on January 27. After the Lunar New Year red market, the market situation gradually improved. Although March was an ex-dividend market price, market sentiment improved due to preparations for reform, and market prices rose step by step. After about three weeks of hovering and brewing, the market situation suddenly turned bullish on March 17 and 18. Rumors spread in the market that the visit of Mr. Kodama or the economic aspects might be beneficial. Market sentiment was excited, and large accounts absorbed, which was very lively. The intensity of the bullishness was beyond expectation. By March 23, the last day of March, Type C bonds had risen to 70 yuan and 9 jiao and a half, with a difference of 8 yuan between the highest and lowest prices. The highest price for Type A bonds was only 76 yuan and 7 jiao, with a difference of only 4 yuan and a half between the highest and lowest prices. Therefore, the futures for April and May continued to rise, and the situation was excellent, with a tendency to rise rather than fall. Today is the end of the holiday, and the market will open as usual, which will be lively. The delivery, account transfer, and total transaction volume are listed separately below (unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Overview of Yarn and Cotton Delivery</h3>
<p>Quantity: Cotton Increased, Yarn Decreased</p>
<p>Yarn: The March futures for Golden Rooster yarn opened on October 1 last year at 210 yuan, and fell slightly to 205 yuan. Subsequently, due to the well-distributed rainfall in the country and the abundant harvest of agricultural products, autumn sales gradually developed. In addition, due to business difficulties, many yarn factories suspended operations and reduced working hours in July and August, and cotton yarn production was drastically reduced. Therefore, speculators, seeing the favorable environment, raised prices against each other, and new peaks appeared one after another. By October 19, the panic of the short positions reached its peak. The prices for each month soared by 8 yuan and 8 jiao, and a suspension of trading was announced. Yarn sales continued to be active. The price rose again to the upper limit on December 1. The peak was once seen at 251 yuan on January 8. Later, with the suspension of yarn sales at the beginning and end of the Lunar New Year, yarn factories fully increased spindles and started production, and the Indian merchants sent bulls to sell short. On March 3, the low price reached 234 yuan and 9 jiao again, but Bian Shao, seeing that spring sales had not yet occurred, tightened his hold and rose again to 45 yuan and 2 jiao. The final price was 242 yuan, 32 yuan higher than the opening price. As a result, 11,150 bales remained to be delivered, a decrease of 12,350 bales compared to the previous month. The delivery price, calculated based on the last three days, was 243 yuan, 12 yuan lower than in October. 10-count yarns accounted for the majority of the delivered goods, and 20-count yarns were also substantial. The brand names and quantities of the brokers on both the receiving and delivering sides are listed below.</p>
<p>▲Delivering Party for Marked Yarn</p>
<p>▲Receiving Party for Marked Yarn</p>
<p>Cotton: The March futures for marked cotton opened on October 1 last year at 41 yuan and 3 jiao, falling to 40 yuan. Afterwards, due to the improvement in yarn sales and the soaring yarn prices, the interdependent cotton market was brought into a better situation, and the market also moved forward. Unfortunately, domestic production was abundant, and cotton stocks from all sources were abundant, so the upward pressure was not as strong as in the yarn market. The peak was once seen at 45 yuan and 2 jiao on December 14, but ultimately, due to the thick stocks of blended cotton and sluggish demand from factories, the price slowly fell back to 42 yuan and a half. Recently, US cotton has risen step by step, and is currently rising to 1 jiao and 5 fen, causing market turmoil and rising to 474 yuan and 8 jiao and a half. The final closing price was 44 yuan and 4 jiao, 3 yuan and 1 jiao higher than the opening price. As a result, 63,800 dan remained, an increase of 14,800 dan compared to the previous month. The delivery price, calculated based on the last three days, was 44 yuan, 1 yuan higher than the previous month. The delivered goods included Hankou cotton, Shashi cotton, Huoji cotton, and Lingbao cotton, all of which were taken in by arbitrageurs. The brand names and quantities of the brokers on both the receiving and delivering sides are listed below.</p>

<h3>During Five-Day Holiday, 1,600 Bales of Spot Yarn Opened</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Yarn and Cloth Exchange held the March delivery and closed the market as usual. The spot market met as usual, and spot yarn trading was still good. Selling prices rose by 2 yuan to 3 yuan. The quantities traded by each merchant are listed below.</p>
<p>Trading was not much during the holiday. Only Tianjin merchants imported 650 bales of 16-count Airplane, Double Dragon, Peacock, and Jincheng yarns, and the same merchants imported 107 bales of 20-count Double Deer and other yarns.</p>
<h3>Factories Compete to Buy Lingbao Cotton</h3>
<p>Spot cotton sales are still good. Because foreign cotton is rising and spot yarn is rising, the situation is firm and rising, but factories are unwilling to accept high prices because they still have abundant cotton stocks. Therefore, it is not easy to conclude deals when asking prices are higher. Yesterday, the factories mostly purchased Lingbao cotton. The quantities and prices are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Merchants Await Developments in Pledged Cotton and Labor Strikes</h3>
<p>Indian Cotton Falls by 1-2 Rupees</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the US cotton market, prices fell by 1 pound of sound to rose by 5 pounds of sound for each month. Before noon, trading was not much, and prices were weak due to the liquidation of long positions and the sale of cotton farmers, but brokers and the New Orleans consortium bought in unison, so the market situation immediately recovered. Afterwards, the market situation was mixed, with limited new accounts. The industry is awaiting the progress of pledged cotton and labor strikes. Spot cotton is firm, and the cloth market is firm but stagnant. At the close, short accounts covered at low prices, foreign merchants bought in, and market prices rose again. Spot goods rose by 3 pounds of sound, and futures rose by 3 to 9 pounds of sound. With the US cotton market closed, Indian cotton initially rose due to speculative buying, but fell back due to unfavorable telegrams from New York. Transactions were few. Pingguoer was unchanged, Aomula fell by 1 to 1.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.75 to 2 rupees, according to the original telegram on the left (telegram of the 29th).</p>
<p>It is also heard that the Mumbai telegram forecast the opening on the 30th, with Bailuoxi at 243.25 rupees, Pingguoer at 199.5 rupees, both up by half a rupee, and Aomula at 230.5 rupees, unchanged.</p>
<h3>Rise and Fall of Grade-Three Yarn and Cotton Market?</h3>
<p>Osaka telegram of the 30th: spot yarn fell by 1 yuan, 16-count fan surface at 251 yuan, 20-count goldfish at 272 yuan, both up by 1 yuan, 40-count five-star at 403 yuan, 42-count pheasant at 392 yuan, both unchanged. Grade-three futures yarn fell by 1 to 4 jiao, with near-term at 266.9 yuan and far-term at 263.4 yuan. Futures cotton rose by 1 jiao and 5 fen to fell by 1 jiao, with near-term at 80.55 yuan and far-term at 82.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Yarn Market: Futures Up, Spot Down</h3>
<p>Qingdao telegram of the 30th from the same alliance: Songlu marked yarn on the Qingdao Exchange rose by 4.5 to 5 yuan, and marked cloth rose by 1 jiao, according to the original telegram record on the left.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: White Goods Selling Prices Rise One After Another</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was due to holiday closure, but foreign cotton of all three grades were rising. East-made fine cloth and fine twill saw good sales. Sentiment among industry players was firm and rising, so the selling prices of white goods in the morning market rose unanimously. Fine cloth rose by 5 fen (per piece), and fine twill rose by 7.5 fen to 1 jiao. This was because sales of military uniform dye blanks continued to be strong, and bottoms were particularly scarce. Changzhou factory twill was actually higher than last week by over 2 jiao (per piece). Heavyweight coarse cloth from Shenxin, Zhentai, and other brands of this factory were increasingly depleted, and the increase in unified tax was about to be implemented, so market sentiment was even stronger. Selling prices rose by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half per piece. Yihua 16-pound coarse cloth increased its asking price by 2 jiao, 13-pound and 11-pound increased by 1 jiao, and 9-pound increased by 5 fen (per piece). Wholesale merchants in this street absorbed more than 600 bales of coarse cloth of various grades. There are approximately 1,000 bales of dye blanks, fine cloth, and fine twill in the current futures market. The best in terms of sales was the Yangtze River merchant, and the demand from the northern regions of Yantai, Qingdao, Jinan, and Jinjie was still strong. Merchants from Ningbo and Shaoxing also handled more than 300 bales of coarse cloth.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Prices Decline Consistently</h3>
<p>Local Japanese Factories Follow Down by 5-10 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market resumed operations after the Spring Festival holiday, and Western merchants and foreign firms resumed normal business. According to Reuters, silk prices in Japan and the US all declined consistently after the customs opening. Yesterday, the near-term and far-term prices of standard silk in New York each fell by a massive 9.5 fen (compared to the market of March 25, other holding prices such as Japanese silk at 0.83 and Shanghai silk, etc., were not changed). The spot market price in Yokohama yesterday, compared to the market before the holiday, showed spot prices down by 50 yuan and futures down by 2-3 yuan. In the Lyon silk market, Japanese silk fell by 4.25 francs, Shanghai silk A-grade was unchanged, B-grade fell by 1 franc, and Guangdong silk fell by 1.5 francs. The Shanghai silk market was difficult to trade due to the low prices of overseas supplies (such as ordinary white factory silk without uniformity only costing 700 yuan). However, Indian Zhuang Chuanjing slightly purchased user silk. The Hangzhou merchant was still purchasing substantially, but the market price decreased by 5-10 yuan or so. A total of 57 bales were sold yesterday.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Gold Needle Vegetable Market Difficult to Loosen Again</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of gold needle vegetables have been sluggish, and market prices have gradually fallen back, with ordinary ones once entering the 20 yuan range. However, the current price level has reached a considerable point, and sellers are unwilling to loosen further, gradually showing stability. Yesterday, it was heard that 70-odd bags had been opened, with higher ones at 20 yuan and 8 jiao, followed by 20 yuan and 5-6 jiao, and ordinary ones at 19 yuan and 8 jiao, 4-5 jiao better than the previous time. If inventory consumption is activated, it may need to be tightened again. The market price for top Zhuang vegetable is called at 21 yuan and a half, followed by 20 yuan and 19 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dongbai Discount Continues Slightly by 5 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was not much movement in the sugar market. The association's discounts, such as spot and re-export goods for 24 coarse white, were unchanged. Spot 8-number Dongbai was at 12 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, 9-number was at 12 yuan and 2 jiao, a slight discount of 5 fen continued. The remaining prices were quoted at the original prices. Among the Benchang mian, Zhenji 1-number was at 21 yuan and a half, and 2,3,4,5 numbers were discounted accordingly. Only the Da merchant opened up dozens of boxes of mixed-brand Da ice, with prices as before, unchanged.</p>
<h3>Hardware: White Lead Sheet Footing Firm and Rising</h3>
<p>Since the lead sheet market has been firm overseas for several days, yesterday, Reuters reported that goods produced by Bide were all purchased by Japan, so there were no goods that could come to China, and the goods produced by the UK and US were not much. Therefore, the market is very strong, and the footing is as strong as steel and other products. As for the recent situation in the Shanghai market, the market situation is relatively quiet because actual sales have turned sluggish, but the hoarding account is mostly absorbing, and industry players are also mostly monopolizing, so the market price is exceptionally strong. Number 2 opens at 210 yuan, number 3 at 200 yuan, number 4 at 195 yuan, number 5 and 6 at 190 yuan, number 7 at 185 yuan, and number 8, 9, and 10 all open at 178 yuan. The price for quasi-color opens from 180 yuan to 200 yuan. It is found that yesterday's market成交 totalled 600-700 buckets.</p>

<h3>Industrial Exhibition</h3>
<p>—Yang An</p>
<p>Shanghai is the industrial center of the country. What is the state of Shanghai's industrial progress? This is well worth a look. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Government's Bureau of Social Affairs is preparing to hold a large-scale Shanghai Municipal Industrial Exhibition. This is the best way to promote industrial technology and to draw the public's attention to domestic industrial goods, and is by no means comparable to ordinary gatherings.</p>
<p>We believe that there are three points to pay attention to at the beginning of the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Exhibition.</p>
<p>First, the items collected for this time must pay attention to the grade and quality standards of domestic goods, and must be carefully selected, and must not be abused. If there is any doubt, a field investigation must be conducted to ensure that there is no doubt before it can be selected. If there is only a sales store number and no factory, it will not be accepted. If there is the form of a factory, but there is actually no working technology, it will not be accepted. If it is purely foreign technicians and foreign raw materials, it will not be accepted. Because Shanghai is the focus of attention from all countries, and is watched by all eyes, if there is any place for fraud, it will not only damage its reputation, but also be despised and laughed at by various countries.</p>
<p>Second, since it is called the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Exhibition, then all the products of Shanghai factories are of course in the scope of collection. It is not appropriate to collect too much, and it is also not appropriate to omit any. Therefore, during the preparation, it is best to focus on investigation work, and all industrial products that are valuable and worth exhibiting should be collected in many ways to avoid omission. Products that are creative inventions with promotional value should be especially displayed to attract attention.</p>
<p>Third, the classification of the collected items must be paid great attention to, so that the audience can see at a glance and will not be confused. The method of display is best to adopt the method of manufacturing process. For example, for wool textiles, it can start from wool and end with the production of woolen cloth. The intermediate steps can all be displayed and explained. This not only shows the manufacturing method, but also shows the quality of the technology, and also allows the public to understand the production steps and strengthen their confidence in using domestic goods. The problems of abuse and falsehood can also be avoided, which is very important.</p>
<p>In short, the holding of an industrial exhibition is an important matter. The prior investigation, collection, classification, review, selection, the on-site display, arrangement, the post-event evaluation, research, and awards, etc., all require strict procedures and scientific methods to achieve perfection. The industrial community is even more in need of enthusiastic participation and enthusiastic assistance to complete this great undertaking.</p>
<h3>Salt Quality and Dental Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Xiang Rong</p>
<p>Among the human body's tissues, the hardest is probably teeth. Logically, since teeth are the hardest, they should be the least prone to damage. However, the reality is quite different. According to expert statistics, tooth decay is widespread throughout the world, affecting at least 60% of the total population.</p>
<p>This is because, although teeth are hard, there are several things that easily damage them. First are acids, especially lactic acid, which is present in sugary substances. If it remains in our mouths, it can gradually erode the enamel on our teeth, causing it to flake off. Once the dentin underneath is exposed, the nerves inside our teeth will begin to ache. Second are microorganisms, which constantly produce toxins on our teeth. These not only damage our teeth but also cause problems in the mouth and the entire body. Third is tartar, which preserves acids and microorganisms that decay teeth. Because of these three things, human teeth suffer significant damage.</p>
<p>To avoid this damage, the most important thing is to pay attention to the hygiene of the teeth and mouth. Brushing teeth is, of course, essential, and the use of dental cleaning products is indispensable every day.</p>
<p>Regarding dental cleaning products, in terms of nature, there are various types such as toothpaste, tooth powder, and mouthwash. In terms of materials, there are various ingredients such as mint, calcium carbonate, chalk, and alkaline substances. However, according to modern scientific research, salt is also one of the best dental cleaning products. First, salt can neutralize acidic substances in our mouths, preventing them from harming the enamel on our teeth. Second, salt has strong antibacterial properties; it is commonly used as a preservative. Therefore, it can kill microorganisms in our mouths without harming our bodies. Third, it has the effect of removing tartar. In addition, it can also eliminate bad breath, which is extremely important for protecting oral hygiene.</p>
<p>In fact, the significant effect of salt on dental hygiene has long been noted in our country. Many people use table salt to brush their teeth, which is clear evidence. However, it has not been scientifically formulated, which is of course a deficiency. As far as I know, the Tanggu Jiuda Refined Salt Company has used salt to produce Neptune toothpaste, tooth powder, and mouthwash. However, these products are common in the north but not yet widespread in the south. It is said that they have a good effect on cleaning teeth.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should not only know that salt is essential for maintaining life but also understand its significant relationship to dental hygiene.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Sales Promotion (5)</h3>
<p>— Ding Kai</p>
<p>㊂ A Perspective on Gimmick Sales Tactics</p>
<p>We often see certain goods or companies relying on novel ideas and endless "tricks" to promote their products, or focusing on methods like "low prices" and prize-winning "lotteries." The business itself may either achieve success by chance, remain stagnant, or even be affected negatively. The costs of sales promotion (auxiliary costs), such as advertising and giveaways, may actually increase as a result. This is what people in Shanghai commonly call "gimmicks."</p>
<p>Based on people's inherent desires for stimulation and novel experiences, any such sensations can certainly create a temporary demand. However, as circumstances change, they become relics of the past. We understand that the establishment of commercial and industrial enterprises is primarily aimed at creating a foundation. While temporary stimulation may be suitable, it is not a sustainable basis for permanent growth. I will now analyze this from different perspectives:</p>
<p>Sales Promotion ㊀ Appealing Gimmicks ㊁ Price Reductions to Lure Customers ㊂ Giveaways to Attract Customers ㊃ Lotteries to Create Excitement</p>
<p>The Motives Stem from the Desire to Boost Sales, Win Competitive Advantages, or Reduce Excess Inventory</p>
<p>The Benefits Are Limited to the Short Term</p>
<p>The author does not fundamentally oppose the use of gimmicks. In fact, I strongly advocate for the implementation of innovative methods to support the foundation of goods sales. I often secretly observe businesses that employ these methods and, based on my experience, have reached the following conclusions:</p>
<p>㊀ As a short-term measure, it is beneficial without drawbacks and can create opportunities for products to imprint on consumers' minds.</p>
<p>㊁ For clearing out inventory, it can be used temporarily to gain an advantage.</p>
<p>㊂ For opening up new markets and providing temporary assistance in advertising.</p>
<p>㊃ For maintaining existing markets and stimulating the metabolism of old and new products.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that these are "temporary dynamics" and cannot be considered permanent sales plans.</p>
<h3>Explanation of the Pocket-Sized Folding Umbrella for Both Sunny and Rainy Days</h3>
<p>— Gong Xinglei</p>
<p>Purpose of Creating a Folding Umbrella</p>
<p>Umbrellas are everyday items, but because the weather is unpredictable, with both sun and rain, carrying an umbrella while traveling can be cumbersome. I, therefore, decided to reform the umbrella so that it could be stored in a bag when not in use, making it easier to carry. Thus, the pocket-sized folding umbrella was created.</p>
<p>How to Use the Folding Umbrella</p>
<p>When using the umbrella, align the notch on the edge of the outer shell of the sliding ring with the spring pin in the middle partition. Then, use your right hand to pull out the contracted umbrella handle, and use your left hand to take the sliding ring and push it upward until the spring on the sliding ring is controlled. The umbrella will then be fully opened.</p>
<p>When retracting the umbrella, use your right hand to take the umbrella handle and your left hand to take the sliding ring. Then, turn your right hand to the left and your left hand to the right until it stops. Push the sliding ring downward and push the umbrella handle inward at the same time. When not in use, tie the strap tightly and then put it in a thin rubber bag.</p>
<p>There are four steps for using the umbrella:</p>
<p>㊀ Align the notch on the edge of the outer shell of the sliding ring with the spring pin in the middle partition.</p>
<p>㊁ Loosen the umbrella cloth.</p>
<p>㊂ Use your right hand to pull out the contracted umbrella handle, and use your left hand to take the sliding ring and push it upward, keeping the top of the umbrella facing upward, until the spring control ring is reached.</p>
<p>㊃ After opening, it is similar to a regular umbrella.</p>
<p>Materials of the Folding Umbrella</p>
<p>Steel sheets are ordered from a steel factory, which are specifically made for folding umbrellas. After quenching, the outer layer is hard, and the center is still tough. Steel that is not easily rusted even when wet is most suitable. The umbrella handle and sliding ring should be made of a net material to make the umbrella light and sturdy. However, the thickest section of the umbrella handle should be made of a material similar to bakelite to make it non-slip and more aesthetically pleasing. The umbrella cloth can be made of domestically produced silk or a material of similar quality. All of the above parts should be ordered from the raw material factory, otherwise, the cost of labor and materials will be high.</p>
<p>Manufacturing of the Folding Umbrella</p>
<p>All parts must be manually assembled, but the rest can be manufactured by machines.</p>
<p>Size and Weight of the Pocket-Sized Folding Umbrella</p>
<p>(Large, for men) The diameter after retraction can be reduced to 1.5 inches, the length is 9.3 inches, and the weight is 1 pound, which is 6 ounces lighter than a regular umbrella (produced by the Shanghai Fuxin Factory). The size after opening is the same as a regular umbrella.</p>
<p>(Small, for women) The diameter after retraction can be reduced to 1.1 inches, the length is 9.3 inches, and the weight is a little over 9 ounces. The diameter after opening is 36 inches.</p>
<h3>The Decline of H鹽 Sea Salt Silk Fabric in Agriculture (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Qin</p>
<p>However, even though the price of this silk fabric is so low that it cannot be reduced any further, the dumping of foreign goods and fabrics into our inland rural areas has resulted in some being sold for only a few cents per foot. Because farmers are greedy for the cheap prices and beautiful patterns of foreign goods, they all flock to buy them, abandoning local silk fabrics. Local silk fabrics have plain colors and complicated weaving methods. Therefore, due to the impact of the foreign fabric market in recent years, farmers there are already considering giving up weaving altogether.</p>
<p>Mr. Ren also said: "I am willing to invest in rural areas, promote domestic silk fabrics, establish a model silk weaving factory in the area, develop rural industry, and use scientific methods to improve the speed of production, the quality, and the beauty of the patterns. The various silk fabrics produced will surely develop day by day. In a few years, it will not be difficult to become the iron army of domestic silk fabrics."</p>
<p>Overall, the development of the rural sideline silk fabric industry in Haiyan is gradually declining. At the same time, the threat of foreign goods makes it impossible for local silk fabrics to develop. Indeed, our government authorities and local leaders should quickly devise remedies. There is an urgent need to develop and manufacture goods to develop China's rural industry and increase domestic goods.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Yixin Toothbrush Factory</h3>
<p>— Liang Tongfang</p>
<p>Toothbrushes are one of the necessities of daily life. Because they are closely related to human hygiene, they are indispensable. The breadth of their sales is self-evident.</p>
<p>Before 1925, the toothbrushes sold in the Chinese market, apart from a very few domestic toothbrushes that were of poor quality and clumsy design, were all imported. The annual outflow of money was considerable.</p>
<p>In 1925, Mr. Wen Shaohe and Mr. Dai Zhicheng, in view of the lack of domestic toothbrush factories and to promote the scientific manufacturing of toothbrushes, raised funds to establish the Yixin Toothbrush Factory on Huining Road, Xieqiao, in the Nanshi district of Shanghai. It now has more than 300 workers, and its products are trademarked "Yixin."</p>
<p>The raw materials for toothbrushes are cattle bones and pig bristles. Pig bristles are purchased from Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and other provinces, and cattle bones are also domestically sourced. The toothbrush manufacturing process can be roughly divided into two parts: bristle washing and bone making. Bristle washing involves using chemical agents to bleach the pig bristles white and then dividing them into various types according to thickness, length, softness, and hardness. As for the process of making bones into toothbrushes, it is very complicated. I will now write about it roughly below: First, the cow leg bones are sawn into the length of a toothbrush. They are split into the shape of a toothbrush, and the bone material is polished. Many eye holes for threading the bristles are made with a machine, and several very long vertical holes are made at the top of the toothbrush. In this way, when threading the bristles, the thread can be threaded out from the vertical holes without being exposed on the outside. This is called the hidden threading method. That step is relatively difficult. The next procedure is to grind and cut the bone material to make it flat, smooth, and the same as an ordinary toothbrush. Then, it is boiled in chemical agents for five or six hours to remove the toxins from the bone material. Then, the bristles are threaded, and the threaded bristles are cut flat, or the middle part of the bristles is cut short so that the top and tail protrude. This is more elaborate because, when brushing teeth, the protruding part of the toothbrush can easily brush away dirt and food debris from the gaps between the teeth. The vertical holes of the hidden-threaded toothbrush must also be filled in so that the thread is not exposed on the outside, and the bristles must be straightened and washed clean. Finally, the trademark is printed on the toothbrush handle, and it is polished to make the toothbrush more shiny. Before packing and shipping, a rigorous inspection procedure is carried out to remove damaged toothbrushes, and the finished toothbrushes are disinfected again to avoid sticking to unclean dust. The above-mentioned manufacturing procedures, except for threading the bristles, are all made by machines. Therefore, with division of labor and cooperation, the output is very rapid.</p>
<p>In addition to paying attention to never losing bristles, the machine-made toothbrushes of the Yixin Toothbrush Factory have many other characteristics: ㊀ They are manufactured using new-style machines, and the products are neat and excellent. ㊁ They use high-quality raw materials and have excellent quality. ㊂ The work is done entirely by workers with more than five years of experience, so the work efficiency is fast, and the products are exceptionally exquisite. ㊃ There are many styles, some are made in Western style, and some are designed independently, or they are identified by dentists, with as many as fifty or more types. Men, women, old, and young, each have various toothbrushes that are suitable for them, making them comfortable to use. ㊄ All products must undergo several boilings, bleaching, and thorough disinfection. After being tested and certified by dentists, they are extremely hygienic. ㊅ The bristles are threaded using the hidden threading method, which makes it difficult to lose bristles and hide dirt, making them smooth and comfortable to use. ㊆ The packaging is exquisite, and the sealing is complete and tight, so dust and bacteria cannot enter.</p>
<p>Just mentioning the above few advantages, the exquisiteness and practicality of Yixin brand toothbrushes are worth recommending to readers.</p>

<h3>Swedish Chargé d'Affaires Visited Wang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Presenting the Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star on Behalf of His Government</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Committee, arrived in Shanghai yesterday to change his medication. He met with Dr. Noel in the morning. At about 5:00 PM, Baron Johan Beck Friis, the Swedish Chargé d'Affaires in China, visited him at his residence to present the Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star (Grand Broi sde l'ordre de l'etoile Polaire) on behalf of the Swedish government. Chairman Wang received him and offered champagne and refreshments. Zeng Zhongming, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, was also present. The Chargé d'Affaires first delivered a speech, stating, "I am honored to represent the King and Government of Sweden in presenting Chairman Wang with the Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star. Our government greatly admires China's progress in recent years. Chairman Wang, as a modern statesman, has devoted much effort to promoting Sino-Swedish relations in recent years. We are deeply grateful for his support of the Swedish scientist Sven Hedin's work in Xinjiang some years ago. Today, I am honored to personally present this medal on behalf of my country. I sincerely hope that Sino-Swedish relations will become closer and that the Swedish embassy in China will be established soon." Chairman Wang immediately replied, stating, "Sino-Swedish relations have always been close. Your country has made great contributions in science, industry, and commerce, which we have always admired. Sino-Swedish relations depend on the efforts of your Chargé d'Affaires. I believe that they will continue to grow in the future. I am very grateful to the King and Government of your country for presenting me with this medal. I am also pleased to hear that Mr. Sven Hedin is in good health." It is reported that the Swedish government's decision to award Chairman Wang with this medal was originally communicated to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs last year. The Ministry then submitted a request to the National Government for approval to accept and wear the medal. All procedures had been completed, but Chairman Wang was traveling in Europe at the time and could not be presented with the medal. After Chairman Wang returned to the country, the Swedish Chargé d'Affaires visited him in Nanjing on the 12th of this month to discuss the matter. Today, Chairman Wang happened to be in Shanghai, so the Swedish Chargé d'Affaires personally presented the medal.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Xiangxi and other special envoys who will attend the coronation ceremony of the British monarch will depart from Shanghai on the Italian ship Victoria on April 2.

<h3>Shanghai Consular Corps Hosted a Farewell Banquet for Mayor Wu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Expressing Sympathy and Understanding to Each Other at the Banquet, The Silver Plate Will Remain a Lasting Remembrance</p>
<p>The consuls-general and consuls of various countries in Shanghai hosted a banquet for Mayor Wu at the American Club on Sima Road last night (the 30th).</p>
<p>They also invited Chinese and foreign guests to accompany them. More than 100 people attended. At the banquet, the leader of the Consular Corps, Norwegian Consul-General Erle, delivered a speech on behalf of all, praising Mayor Wu's achievements in Shanghai and expressing the admiration of foreigners. He also presented a silver plate on behalf of the consuls-general and their wives as a memento. Mayor Wu then delivered a response in English, expressing his gratitude for the grand banquet. He said that he felt very sad and indescribable as he was about to leave Shanghai. Mr. Erle said that his departure from Shanghai to Guangdong was a loss for Shanghai and a gain for Guangdong. But he believed that his departure from Shanghai was his loss, and no one else would gain anything. Because in Guangdong, there will always be a chairman who is better than him, while he will be separated from his good friends. This loss is irreparable. He said that the reason why he took up his post in Guangdong was that he could not disobey the government's orders. Looking back over the past five years, he was deeply impressed by the broad-minded attitude, sympathy, understanding, and ever-ready cooperation of his foreign friends. The past five years have been full of hardships, but they have never failed to receive generous understanding and sympathy. This is due to the spirit of mutual understanding and consideration. The pleasant and friendly relationship between the Chinese and foreigners in Shanghai has always been a source of pride for him. This is undoubtedly due to the guidance and encouragement of the consuls and related foreigners. The fact that there are three municipal governments in one corner of Shanghai naturally creates an unusual situation. In the past, the three municipal governments were seen as standing in opposition to each other, competing with each other. This situation has now completely changed. They are now gradually moving towards the point where they must combine their strength and share the difficulties. This trend, although slow, is gradually progressing. The spirit of close cooperation has been demonstrated in extremely difficult circumstances. He dared to say that, on more than one occasion, they have proved that they can put aside petty difficulties when necessary and work together for the overall well-being of Shanghai. He believed that now is the time for them to think and plan for the entire people of Shanghai. He thanked the friends for giving him the silver plate and said that he would always cherish this plate as a souvenir of the friends' love for him and their friendship. His wife was unable to attend the banquet due to health reasons, and he hoped that they would understand. Finally, he would like to thank the friends for their kindness again and wish them good health. In another news report, Arnold, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, sent a letter to Mayor Wu the other day to congratulate him on his new position. Mayor Wu replied with a letter of thanks, which is translated as follows: "Dear Mr. Chairman, I have received your kind letter and am deeply grateful for the congratulations from you and all the directors. I feel very happy and appreciative of the kindness and concern shown by you when I leave Shanghai. The fact that the authorities of the concession have always cooperated with me willingly and that the relationship between the two sides is harmonious is something that I will always remember. To Mr. Arnold, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council."</p>
<h3>City Government Colleagues Held Farewell Banquet for Mayor Wu Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yu Hongjun and Huang Boqiao Gave Farewell Speeches; Mayor Wu Responded with Words of Encouragement</p>
<p>All colleagues of the Municipal Government and its affiliated bureaus held a banquet at noon yesterday in the auditorium of the Municipal Government to bid farewell to Mayor Wu. The hall was filled with convivial toasts and bustling activity. The City Police Bureau band played music, creating a lively atmosphere. First, Acting Mayor Yu delivered a farewell speech, followed by an introduction of Huang Boqiao, former Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and current Director of the Two-Roads Administration, who also gave a farewell speech. Finally, Mayor Wu delivered his response. The speeches of Yu, Huang, and Wu are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's Speech: Acting Mayor Yu began by delivering a farewell speech, stating that Mayor Wu had been ordered to take up a post in the Guangdong Provincial Government. The colleagues of this government, under the leadership of Mayor Wu, have served the local community of this city for many years. Now that we are parting ways, we feel a sense of melancholy. In a few days, Mayor Wu will leave Shanghai to take up his new post. Therefore, the colleagues of the Municipal Government have initiated this farewell banquet. Mayor Wu has taken time out of his busy schedule to attend, and our attachment is hard to express in words. Mayor Wu's great personality, far-sighted vision, broad-minded attitude, and patriotic spirit are well-known to his friends and colleagues, and are also widely understood by people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign. I saw a Western newspaper article that regarded Mayor Wu's transfer to the chairmanship of Guangdong Province as "Shanghai's loss and Guangdong's gain." Today, we are parting with a good official, which is naturally depressing and unpleasant. However, Mayor Wu's trip is also for the service of the Party and the country. In the future, we will still be able to receive his guidance from time to time. We have benefited from Mayor Wu's kindness in the past, and we will still be able to hear his great teachings in the future. Although we are separated physically, our spirits remain united, so we can still be optimistic about the future of this city, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang's Speech: Huang Boqiao then delivered a speech, stating,</p>
<p>Today, I am very fortunate to participate in this grand farewell banquet for Mayor Wu as a former colleague. The establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government has been ten years to date. In these ten years, the mayor has changed four times, and Mayor Wu has served the longest term. Recalling that since Mayor Wu took office, the 'January 28th Incident' occurred, he was able to work hard and endure hardship, dealing with this great difficulty with a calm and composed spirit. Recalling that at that time, each bureau had a joint office, Mayor Wu handed me a handwritten order to immediately rescue the refugees in the war zone. I still keep this handwritten order to this day, which shows that Mayor Wu, even when diplomacy was very tense, the military was very urgent, and the economy was in a very difficult situation, was still able to take care of the safety of the citizens. His concern for the citizens can be seen from this. Today, as we hold this grand event in this magnificent auditorium, we cannot help but think of Mayor Wu's efforts in municipal construction over the past few years. After the 'January 28th' catastrophe, Mayor Wu was still able to devote himself wholeheartedly to promoting various important constructions. Today, the magnificent buildings in the central area of the city stand tall, and various undertakings for the benefit of the citizens are also being carried out one by one. Now, the plan for Greater Shanghai has taken shape, and people from all walks of life, especially Europeans and Americans, unanimously sing praises. Mayor Wu's departure from Shanghai to Guangdong is certainly a loss for Shanghai, but a gain for Guangdong. As the Chinese say, "Guan Yin of the South Sea," Guangdong has suffered considerable losses in the twenty years since the rise of the revolutionary army. Now, our Mayor Wu, like Guan Yin of the South Sea, will surely benefit the South Sea and be able to save the people of Guangdong Province with his spirit of great compassion. Finally, I raise my glass to wish him: 1. Good health, 2. All the best, 3. Bon voyage.</p>
<p>Mayor's Reply: Mayor Wu then delivered a response, stating, Today, I am grateful for the kindness of my colleagues in holding this farewell banquet. Such a banquet is due to our separation, and at a time of separation, the emotions are naturally different from usual. Especially today's farewell marks my separation from colleagues who have shared weal and woe for five or six years, and there must be an even more difficult to express sadness. I recall that when I took office as mayor, it had not been three weeks before the unprecedented disaster, the 'January 28th Incident,' occurred. This kind of once-in-a-lifetime opportunity can either make people more determined to save the situation, or it can make people avoid difficulties and give up on themselves. I dared not give up on myself after taking office. The more serious the difficulties, the more my sense of responsibility was encouraged. After the end of the war, we recovered the lost land, handled the aftermath of the war zone, and carried out the reconstruction of the war zone. Then, we worked hard to develop the central area of the city and gradually realize it. This achievement is not the result of my efforts alone, but the result of the hard work of the previous mayors and the consistent efforts of the colleagues of the Municipal Government over the past ten years. Especially during my tenure, the continuous efforts of the colleagues of the Municipal Government and the unanimous support of people from all walks of life have made this achievement possible, and I have not failed in my duties. This is something that I am fortunate to have for the rest of my life. Now, the Chinese and Western media and the general public have expressed considerable satisfaction with the recent progress of the city's construction. I am very happy, but there are still many undertakings that have not been carried out, which still require our efforts. After this extremely difficult encounter, it is enough to encourage me how to deal with major responsibilities in the future, and how to be more loyal to the duties of officials and the duties of the people, and to make contributions to the Party and the country in the future. This transfer to the chairmanship of Guangdong Province, Guangdong is a part of China, and it is no different from serving Shanghai. However, first, Shanghai is my second hometown. I have served in Shanghai for six years and lived in Shanghai for nearly twenty years. Especially in the past six years, I have shared weal and woe with Shanghai, especially the Shanghai that suffered severe national disasters. Once separated, there will be endless emotions. Second, in these five or six years, the Shanghai Municipal Government has made considerable progress with the efforts of its colleagues and the support of the citizens of the city. However, in the past, there were still many undertakings, some of which were in the process of design, and some of which were in the process of construction, but they have not been completed. These undertakings are of great importance to the spiritual and material aspects of the citizens, and our municipal party bureau should strive to carry them out. In the future, I will not be able to directly participate in these matters with my colleagues and work together. This is what makes me feel sad at the time of parting. However, the Shanghai Municipal Government has its unique points among the local administrative organs in the country. First, the Municipal Government has its consistent and fixed plans and policies, which are implemented in stages and gradually realized. Now, in these ten years, no matter which mayor, they all follow the rules. Second, for the past ten years, most of the staff of the Shanghai Municipal Government have worked hard according to the rules until now, and have not changed due to the departure of the mayor, so that the colleagues can be stable. This is enough to increase administrative efficiency, and it is rare in other places. At the beginning of my tenure, I also followed the good rules and models of the previous mayors, and everything proceeded as usual. Now, after the good rules and models of the previous mayors and the careful efforts of all the colleagues, a foundation has been laid. Therefore, I hope that the successor mayor will also follow this principle and work hard. The future of Shanghai will definitely have great hope and great progress. Finally, what I have particularly felt in these six years and what I want to particularly mention here is that ㊀ Shanghai used to be dominated by the concessions, but today everyone knows that the Municipal Government is the main body, which makes Shanghai's position more and more upright, and makes the general public know that the Municipal Government can indeed work for the welfare of the citizens and can indeed work hard for modern construction. ㊁ In recent years, colleagues have worked hard to promote service to the society, and the general public has been able to revitalize this spirit, so that the government and the people are united and the whole society is united. ㊂ In recent years, citizen training and student training have been held, which has made the customs of the citizens change day by day, strengthened the people's patriotic confidence, and increased the people's organizational strength. It is rare to achieve this result in this complex and chaotic city. Therefore, when I reported to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, I specifically reported this matter. The Chairman also appreciated it very much. We are very pleased to have this harvest. In the future, when I go to Guangdong to take up my post and go to Nanjing to report, I can always meet with you when I pass through Shanghai. I also hope that you will give me assistance at any time if Guangdong Province will need Shanghai's help in the future. Finally, I express my gratitude. After the meal, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Cantonese Public Banquet: The Shanghai Guangdong Fellow Association • Guangzhao Public Association • Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation • Chaozhou Guildhall • Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Association, five organizations initiated and scheduled to jointly hold a banquet for Mayor Wu at 7:00 pm on March 31 at the Dadong Restaurant on Nanjing Road. Fellow villagers who wish to participate can register at the above five national body offices or the Ningbo Road Taihe Xing Bank before March 31, so that seats can be reserved and tickets can be collected. It is thought that there will be a lively affair.</p>

<h3>Liu, Han, Xu, Feng, etc. Arrived in Shanghai This Morning</h3>

<h3>Citizens' Branch Sent a Letter to Arnold</h3>
<p>Criticizing Improper Handling of Increased Donations</p>
<p>According to New Voice News, the United Association of Citizens of the First Special Zone of this city, the branch associations of the seventh, twelfth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-seventh, thirty-sixth, thirty-eighth, forty-second, and other more than ten districts, jointly sent a letter to Arnold, the Director General of the Public Works Bureau, yesterday morning, saying, "Dear Sir, Mr. Arnold, you have been in charge of the Public Works Bureau for only two years, but from the various measures taken, the welfare of the principals has been considered empty or real or counterproductive. The proposal to increase donations can better make people recognize its courage, but it must be told to Mr. Arnold that public undertakings and private undertakings must have the courage to deal with them, but this kind of courage is used because of the incorrect recognition of the facts. The impact of this is that the business fails in private undertakings, which is only the loss of the shareholders. Mr. Arnold is a big businessman, and he should know this kind of experience. Public undertakings make the political expenses huge, which is for the entire public. Mr. Arnold may be so focused on business that he does not have time to study politics. If he measures it with common sense, he should also know it. According to reports, the financial director said at the meeting of the Finance Committee that the rent has fallen by 70%. Is this the result of the prosperity of the social economy, or the result of the decline? Otherwise, is the director's statement untrue? Mr. Arnold said that the rent is ten yuan, and the monthly increase in donations is only two corners, as if it is not a big deal. Compared with the business loss, which is as high as 700,000 or 800,000 pounds, it is really indifferent. However, there are still people in the world who are very concerned about every penny. Mr. Arnold should have heard of it. Mr. Pei has returned to the mountains, and the public still has the song of Gantang. How much goodwill has Mr. Arnold gained from the public? Is it estimated? Increasing the public burden is a major accident. The proposition of seven to six, extending it for a week, and considering it for a long time, but Mr. Arnold is brave enough to use the weapon of two votes by one person to dismiss the consideration of exercising reason. The establishment of the resolution of increasing donations is due to the courage of Mr. Arnold. Now that the big mistake has not become an iron case, please Mr. Arnold carefully examine the truth of the social economy, review the political books, use the courage to maintain the music team's remittance subsidy, reduce the number of public rickshaws, support public buses, and seal off the Yu Yucun, and release the bells attached to it to make up for the previous faults. I hope to see a reply. Sincerely yours, Mr. Arnold, Director General of the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession."</p>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sent an Urgent Telegram to the Government Requesting that the Import Tax on Foreign Rice Not Be Waived</h3>
<p>Representatives Gu Xinyi and Others Have Gone to Nanjing to Petition; Please Take Into Account National Interests and People's Livelihoods and Adopt It</p>
<p>Gu Xinyi and other representatives of the bean and rice industry, miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry, miscellaneous grain store industry, and Jiangsu Ning Shanghai county rice industry association in this city petitioned that the exemption of foreign rice tax in Guangdong Province would harm national interests and people's livelihoods. Special representatives Gu Xinyi and others went to Nanjing last night and petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance today. This morning, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent an urgent telegram to the Yuan and the Ministry, requesting that it be adopted. The details of each telegram are recorded below:</p>
<p>Urgent Telegram from the Chamber of Commerce: To the Nanjing Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, the exemption of tax on foreign rice and foreign grains for transportation to Guangdong will increase the national leakage and put the national rice in a desperate situation. Gu Xinyi and other representatives of the Shanghai miscellaneous grain and bean rice industry jointly petitioned with representatives from various places today. We respectfully ask you to take into account the national interests and people's livelihoods and adopt it. We are eagerly looking forward to it. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Koushi,</p>
<p>Rice Industry Association: The Bean and Rice Industry Association, the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, the Miscellaneous Grain Store Industry Association, and the Jiangsu Ning Shanghai County Rice Industry Association Joint Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, saying, "Dear Sir, the import tax on foreign rice in Guangdong Province should not be exempted in terms of the integrity of customs duties, and it cannot be exempted in terms of the national economy. Even in terms of the people's food in Guangdong Province, it is not necessary to be exempted. The reasons for this have been seen in the articles and telegrams of various groups published in the newspapers. We will not repeat them here. Who would have thought that the foreign rice tax, which should not be exempted, cannot be exempted, and is not necessary to be exempted, Guangdong Province actually has a saying that it will exempt the tax on imported foreign rice and foreign grains from April 1st by 2 million dan. If it is seen in fact, its impact on national interests and people's livelihoods will be extremely serious. It is no wonder that the people are shocked, the customs are suspicious, and the voices of opposition are all over the provinces. Now, food groups in various provinces and cities have sent representatives to Nanjing and are scheduled to jointly petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance on the 30th of this month, requesting that the exemption be cancelled. We cannot bear to remain silent, and in addition to sending representatives to Nanjing to participate in the petition, we specially ask your association to quickly send a telegram to the Yuan and the Ministry to approve the adoption of this petition, and we will not be able to pray for it."</p>
<p>Telegram from Changsha: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, yesterday received a telegram from Guangdong, stating that the province has clearly approved the tax-free import of 2 million shi of foreign grains, etc. This matter is very important for the domestic rice sales market in the Yangtze River Basin. In addition to sending details separately, we hope to strive for it together to maintain the national economy. The United Office of Export Rice Merchants in Changsha Kou You,</p>
<p>Lunhui Ganzhang: The Nanjing Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, the Guangdong provincial food administration, have repeatedly followed the province's request to put the import of foreign rice and foreign grains on a half-tax account, relax the quota limit, and limit it to 1 million dan, and order the domestic rice-producing provinces to dredge up transportation and sales, allocate special vehicles, and continuously transport them. According to the inspection member sent by the Ministry to inspect the people's food in the province, the situation has improved, and it is reported that the surplus rice that can be exported in Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces is about 20 million dan, and the rice and grain shortage in Shandong Province is only 4 or 5 million dan by the end of the year, which is more than enough to make up for the shortfall. But at this time, there is another request for 2 million dan of foreign rice and foreign grains to be put on a half-tax account again. In this situation, it will not only increase the national leakage, but also put the domestic rice in a desperate situation. Guangdong Province has always taken the overall situation into consideration, and it does not seem that it should follow the habit of eating foreign rice for many years and put the national interests and people's livelihoods behind the plan. It is reasonable to send a telegram to the Yuan (Ministry) to review and approve it, and not to follow the request, so as to maintain domestic agricultural production. We are eager to wait for orders. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Kougan,</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Based Japanese Banks Decide to Return Deposits to the Central Bank</h3>
<p>Yabuki Issues Statement</p>
<p>According to a Domei News Agency report from Shanghai on the 30th, Mr. Yabuki, the branch manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank, issued the following statement when returning all the deposits of Japanese banks based in Shanghai to the Central Bank of China: "At a certain banquet, Mr. Kodama and Mr. Xi Demao of the Central Bank met and occasionally talked about currency reform and the deposit problem of Japanese banks. After that, this matter was used as a starting point to start negotiations. As a result, each bank discussed with the head office separately and decided to return the deposits in Shanghai to the Central Bank under the same conditions as foreign banks."</p>
<p>A reporter from the National News Agency visited Mr. Xi Demao, the Director of the Central Bank, to inquire about the deposit of Japanese banks. According to him, when Mr. Kodama Kenjiro was in Shanghai, he had a pleasant meeting with me and mentioned this matter unintentionally. He also said that he was satisfied. Mr. Xi also said that the bank has reached an agreement with various Japanese banks in Shanghai to receive the deposits immediately and handle them according to the method of other foreign banks.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Workers Went on Strike Last Night</h3>
<p>Party and Government Organs Failed to Mediate This Morning</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the workers of all silk weaving factories in the city demanded to improve the treatment conditions. Other parts have been decided after mediation, but the opinions of labor and capital on the wage issue are different and have not been resolved. The party and government organs of the city convened both parties to hold the third mediation from 9:00 am yesterday. Cai Shengbai, Yuan Weichen, and Jin Deqing of the Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Industry Association, Pan Yuncai of District 1, Zhu Yousheng of District 3, He Yao of District 4, Wu Ying of District 7, and others, as well as Wang Jisong, the representative of the American Asian Factory, Lu Yinchu and Li Weixiong, the representatives of the Municipal Party Department, Xu Yefu, Zhu Guilin, and Zhang Chuqiang of the Social Bureau, etc. attended. Xu Yefu chaired the meeting and Jiang Shifu recorded the meeting. After the chairman read out the second mediation decision, the mediation began. The wage part (including the wage level of weavers, warp and weft workers, apprentices, and pedaling workers), but the labor side insisted on a 20% increase across the board, and the capital side opposed taking the Pu Jia method because the situation of each factory was different and the capital was not uniform. Although the representatives of the party and government organs held individual talks separately, there was still no result. The mediation was declared unsuccessful and adjourned at 5:00 pm.</p>
<p>After the Social Bureau's mediation failed, the labor representatives immediately announced that they would not be responsible in the future, and then went back to report the mediation situation to the city's silk weaving workers, requesting to improve the treatment committee, and held an emergency standing committee, which decided on many important cases before adjourning. The representatives of each district reported back to each district, and the workers in each district automatically went on strike because the mediation had no results. Before 9:30 pm last night, the strikers included Yuhou, Jinji, Xiefeng, Yumin, Yinli, Jinhua, Yuanyuan, Rongzhang, Tianfu, Jindong, Tianxing, Hengyi, Huatong, Xinsheng, Xinfeng, Jinxin, Yifeng, Yiyou, Damei, Puyi, Meiwen, Tiancheng, China, Wanlong, Yuanyuan, Gexin, Linji, Hongchang, Hexing, Jinsheng, Zhicheng, Hengxiang, Xieji, Xielong, Xinhua Zhouji, Dexing, Yongli, Zhicheng, Jiulong, Xieda, Jiufeng, Huiqing, Yunlin, Xiesheng, Jingwei, and 9 factories in the American Asian Factory in the East Shanghai District, the American Asian General Factory, the American Asian 7th Factory, the American Asian 5th Factory, Shengdan, Huacheng, Wufeng, Yuanyuan, Yuanyou, Yili, Yuanxinfeng, Weichang, Yong'an, Qinyu, Tongyuan, Tongfeng, Jiren, Chongqing, Tianyuan, Guangming, Zhongyu, and Sanyi in the South Shanghai District, and the American Asian 10th Factory, the American Asian 2nd Factory, Rongcheng, Juchang, Shengsheng, Yonghua, Xingmin, Weixin, Shixin, and other more than 130 factories in the North Shanghai District. The workers will hold an emergency representative meeting at 7:00 this morning. After hearing the news, the party and government authorities are planning to eliminate and reconcile the situation.</p>
<h3>The New Yu Spinning Mill Labor Dispute Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industries Sends Telegram to Shanghai to Inquire About the Truth; Party and Government Order the Factory to Resume Operations</p>
<p>The labor dispute at the First and Second Factories of the New Yu Spinning Mill has yet to be resolved. The Ministry of Industries yesterday telegraphed the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate the truth of the labor dispute. Yesterday morning, workers sent representatives to the Party and Government to petition. In addition to ordering the factory to resume operations, the Social Affairs Bureau has also scheduled a mediation meeting for April 1st. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Industries Investigation: Since the outbreak of the New Yu labor dispute, no resolution has been reached due to the persistent stances of both parties. In order to maintain industry and promote cooperation between labor and management, the Ministry of Industries specifically telegraphed the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to inquire about the situation and how it is being handled. After receiving the telegram from the Ministry of Industries, the Bureau replied yesterday, stating that the Bureau had instructed the factory to resume operations and ordered the workers to return to work. As for the dismissal of workers, the dispute will be mediated according to the law.</p>
<p>Petition to the Party and Government: The entire workforce of the Second Factory of the New Yu Spinning Mill, located on Robison Road in West Shanghai, sent eight representatives, including Xu Peijin, to the Party and Government offices yesterday morning to petition. Lu Yinchu, a cadre from the Civil Affairs Section of the Municipal Party Committee, Xu Yefu, the head of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Long Yuting, an executive committee member of the General Labor Union, received them. The workers' representatives first explained the reasons for the difficulty in resuming work and the strict precautions taken by the factory, requesting assistance from the authorities. The Party and Government representatives advised the workers to resume work first and await mediation regarding the dismissed workers. The representatives left at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>Order to Resume Operations: Since the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau issued an order for the workers to resume work by a specific date, the workers have been slow to return to the factory due to various difficulties. At the same time, the factory has not announced any plans to resume operations. The authorities believe that the prolonged dispute is detrimental to the welfare of both parties. Therefore, the Party and Government jointly ordered the First and Second Factories to resume operations immediately to allow the workers to return to work.</p>
<p>Scheduled Mediation: As for the 56 dismissed workers, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered a temporary suspension of their return to work. Therefore, the dispute is scheduled for further mediation between labor and management at 10:00 AM on April 1st in accordance with the law, in order to resolve the labor dispute as soon as possible. It is also reported that the factory will issue wages today. All workers have decided to refuse to receive them because the dispute has not been resolved.</p>
<p>Issuing Wages: The spinning mill authorities posted a notice at the factory gate last night stating: "This factory will issue the first half of March wages for the Second Factory from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM tomorrow, and the first half of March wages for the First Factory from 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Unless there are special circumstances, all workers are requested to bring their work booklets to receive the wages." According to the above situation, it is feared that it will be difficult to resume factory operations for a while.</p>
<h3>Important Recommendations in the Shanghai Municipal Council Housing Committee Report</h3>
<p>Reduce Rents and Improve Sanitation; Divided into Six Sections and Listed in a Chart</p>
<p>According to the "North-China Daily News," the Shanghai Municipal Council Housing Committee has been working for many months and has drafted a report for submission to the Municipal Council. The report lists several important recommendations and is specially published in the "Indian Municipal Gazette" on Monday.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council has not yet studied the report and will leave it to the new Board of Directors to consider. One of the most important recommendations is that the Municipal Council should appoint a permanent officer or committee to continue studying ways to ease the situation. From an economic perspective, there are two ways to consider this: one is to reduce rents, and the other is to improve sanitation. The first method includes: ㊀ public subsidies for housing construction; ㊁ reducing the assessed value of cheap housing properties; ㊂ allowing the construction of more multi-story buildings that are not too tall; ㊃ cooperating with the industrial sector to build workers' housing; ㊄ improving cheap transportation; ㊅ cooperating with authorities outside the concession to build houses; ㊆ increasing wages; ㊇ cheap dormitories for single men and women; ㊈ reducing lending rates; ㊉ reducing mortgage rates. The second method includes: ㊀ increasing sanitary facilities; ㊁ rejecting excessive occupants; ㊂ widening roads and alleys, increasing the construction of parks, and planting more trees to improve air circulation; ㊃ reducing coal smoke in the sky; ㊄ cleaning waterways or setting up water pipes; disposal of commercial waste is also included; ㊅ cheaper public water supply; ㊆ separating warehouses and factories to prevent them from concentrating in one place; ㊇ demolishing unsuitable buildings; ㊈ providing family planning education; ㊉ not encouraging excessive immigration into the concession. The report also suggests that the Municipal Council Public Works Department should</p>
<p>Encourage the construction of a standardized style of housing for the establishment of small-scale factories, with workers' dormitories, in order to gradually replace the current unsuitable改造的factory buildings. In the future, no residential building may be used for industrial purposes without obtaining a permit. The regulations in the permit must ensure the safety and hygiene of the workers, and toilets should also be made available. Other important recommendations are as follows: After the committee reviewed the designs of Chinese-style houses proposed by the Public Works Department that would be convenient to build in the future, it advocated that the Municipal Council should approve the</p>
<p>Construction principles contained in this design and advocate that the Municipal Council should encourage and assist in the construction of this type or similar houses, and formulate trial rules for this construction. However, it does not advocate the exclusive use of a fixed design, because it believes that architects should be allowed to make improved designs</p>
<p>Chinese houses within a wide range of possible concessions. All designs for new-style houses should be placed in the Public Works Department for public reference. The trial rules for new buildings should limit the height of rooms in Chinese-style houses to eight feet (Mr. Fraser dissented and advocated eight feet six inches). Furthermore, it is difficult to prevent the courtyard space, which was previously used to provide necessary air space for residents of Chinese-style houses, from being misused. Therefore, the committee advocated that the new trial rules for house construction should not allow courtyards to be used as space, and that space should be provided in the walkways thereafter. The width of the walkways should not be less than five feet. All top floors of buildings used for industrial purposes must be demolished. In the future, no more top floors will be allowed to be built. The report is divided into six sections, along with attached charts, more than thirty pages long, and includes a chart showing the population density per acre in the International Settlement.</p>
<h3>Second Special District Municipalities Jointly Issue Declaration Opposing Increased Donations in the International Settlement</h3>
<p>According to the "National Society," the Municipal Citizens' Federation of the Second Special District of this city held its 13th Organizing Committee meeting yesterday afternoon and resolved to issue a declaration on the increase in the Municipal General Donation in the International Settlement. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Organizing Committee Meeting: The association held its 13th Organizing Committee meeting yesterday. More than ten people including Huang Xianggu, Wang Deyan, Li Weiliang, Wang Haifan, Dong Kechang, Qu Zhenhua, Bei Zairong, Zhou Lingfu, Long Jingyan, Zhang Shishi, Mao Yun, He Erming, and Zheng Ziliang attended. Qu Zhenhua was elected chairman. After the formalities, the progress of the association's affairs was reported, and then the discussion began: ㊀ The association's charter has been drafted and is submitted for review (resolved) and submitted to the Municipal Party Department for review. ㊁ The Board of Directors of the International Settlement Municipal Council, regardless of the economic difficulties of the citizens, brazenly passed the method of increasing the Municipal General Donation. How should the association express its opinion? The resolution was to issue a declaration and send letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the International Settlement, and the Municipal Citizens' Federation of the First Special District to strive for cancellation. ㊂ A letter from the National New Pharmaceutical Industry Association stated that the French Concession authorities have recently severely cracked down on the sale of proprietary medicines by non-pharmacies. All foreign grocery stores selling proprietary medicines have been banned. This matter has greatly affected the safety of patients and the business of pharmaceutical merchants. Please preside over justice and forward a letter to the主管authorities of the French Concession to immediately stop the crackdown to benefit hygiene. The resolution was to forward a letter to the French Concession Public Works Bureau. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Issuing a Declaration: The Municipal Citizens' Federation of the Second Special District issued the following declaration on the issue of the increase in the Municipal General Donation by the International Settlement Municipal Council: "This time, the International Settlement Municipal Council, regardless of everything, brazenly passed the case of increasing the Municipal General Donation at the Board of Directors meeting. When the news came, the public was panicked. The reason why the Municipal Council wants to increase donations is entirely because the income and expenditure cannot be offset. To solve the financial difficulties, we must start from the root and eliminate waste and save expenses. This is a good way. However, the Bureau does not do this, but wants to use the increase in donations to資挹注, abandoning the root and pursuing the end, only increasing the suffering of the citizens without helping the actual finances. Moreover, in recent years, commerce has been declining, and the suffering suffered by the citizens is difficult to describe. Now, in order to solve the financial difficulties, the Municipal Council directly treats the merchants and people who are苟延殘喘 as a move to敲骨吸髓. In this situation, it is tantamount to deliberately摧殘 the merchants and people. Even if it is a dying tree, there is still no time to cultivate and maintain it, but to exploit it will inevitably lead to death. Alas, my citizens, how are we different from this? Although this association is not in the same area, it shares the same fate as the market. Therefore, we believe that the move by the International Settlement Municipal Council to increase the Municipal General Donation is inappropriate. We only hope that the authorities will综聚 the advantages and disadvantages and make a decisive decision to submit this case for reconsideration and cancellation, so that commerce can prosper and the market can be revived."</p>
<h3>Jiang Zhonghe and Others Guilty After Blood Soul Group Appeal</h3>
<p>Each Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Jiang Zhonghe, manager of Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory and manager of Ximen National Goods Company, Ren Jinpin, secretary of the Fish Market, Wang Jingzhi, Wang Zixiang, and others were arrested for participating in the Blood Soul 除奸團 and sent to the First Special District Court. After interrogation, Wang Zixiang was fined 300 yuan, and Jiang and the other three were acquitted. The main culprit Zhang Zilian, who was on the run, was also wanted. However, 补房 Feng 판 expressed dissatisfaction and filed an appeal to the High Second Branch Court through Gan Jingxian, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council Legal Department. After the interrogation was completed, Judge Zhou Han, accompanied by Judges Nie and Xiao, took the seat and announced the judgment separately. The main text stated that the original judgment was revoked, and Jiang Zhonghe, Ren Jinpin, Wang Jingzhi, and Wang Zixiang jointly participated in a society with the purpose of committing crimes, and each was sentenced to six months imprisonment. If the execution is obviously difficult, each can be commuted to a fine of two yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Commends Chinese Police Officer</h3>
<p>Liu Shaolong</p>
<p>Liu Shaolong, Chinese police officer No. 2398 of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, fought with armed robbers on December 31 last year, bravely stepping forward and恪盡厥職. The Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors has approved the award of a first-class special police medal to commend him. On that day, a robbery occurred at a bank on Beijing Road. At that time, the police officer was patrolling nearby with the late patrolman Shi Lai Te on a motorcycle when he heard the alarm and rushed to arrest the robbers. Patrolman Shi died in the line of duty, and a Chinese officer was also shot and killed. The Chinese police officer fired six shots at the robbers, and his coat was shot through three places by bullets fired by the robbers. Two shots fired by the robbers were aimed directly at him, but fortunately, they only penetrated the left sleeve of his coat. At that time, the police officer's gun was out of bullets, so he reloaded it and chased the robbers along Beijing Road to Shandong Road, firing six more shots, and finally joined other detectives to kill one of the robbers. The police officer then returned to the scene of the incident and picked up a bag of coins on the way, which had been dropped by one of the robbers while fleeing along Shandong Road.</p>

<h3>Girl Luo Xi Files Complaint in Vernacular Asking for Chastity Compensation</h3>
<p>Please Order He Kangli to Compensate Damages of More Than 20,000 Gold; Seek Justice from the Judge Based on Legal Basis and Human Sympathy</p>
<p>Luo Xi, a girl from Changsha, also known as Wei Xuezhen, 17 years old this year, was forcibly raped by He Kangli, a fellow villager from Huarong, on October 19 last year. She reported to the French Concession Police Station and filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court, which sentenced He to six months in prison and a three-year reprieve on the 10th of this month. During the appeal period, the defendant was transferred to a detention center. During the criminal trial, the victim filed an incidental civil lawsuit for damages of 20,200 yuan, and the judgment was transferred to the Civil Court for trial. After the criminal verdict, Luo Xi personally wrote a complaint in vernacular and submitted it to the Civil Court of the Second Special Court. Her</p>
<p>Original Complaint Reads: "Wise Judge, I believe that national law is a weapon to punish cunning villains, so the only way for those who抱不平 is to resort to law. I am a weak woman who is零丁孤苦 and suffers重重 oppression. I could not bear the abuse of my foster father and fled to Shanghai to live independently. I was蹂躪by He Kangli, a beast in human form. Because of the exposure of this tragedy, I was冷諷熱嘲 by feudal society, especially this hymen</p>
<p>Still being valued now, my entire future and lifelong happiness have been ruined and I am in a desperate situation. This kind of mental pain is really hard for a sensitive animal to bear. Moreover, I have no artistic talent and my education level is extremely幼稚. I have no way to help myself. Since the ugly thing has been publicized, those who can help me have撒手不顧. Not only is my lifelong life a big problem, but even my current clothing and food are still nowhere to be found. At the hearing on March 6,</p>
<p>The sympathetic audience gave me a few dollars, which were used up long ago. Recently, the Court sent a subpoena. The travel expenses of three 角 five 分 were borrowed from a fellow villager. Because my mind was过受stimulate,禍不單行 and I became seriously ill. The medical expenses were also borrowed东扯西挪. These are all my current difficult situation. These indescribable pains are all given by the道敗類 He Kangli. Wise Judge, this is</p>
<p>What an unfortunate thing. According to the law, "Those who unlawfully infringe upon the rights of others shall be liable for damages." "Those who unlawfully害侵害 the body, health, reputation, or freedom of others, even if the damage is not on property, may also request a price equivalent to the amount." Therefore, I beg the judge, based on the law and with human sympathy, to order the defendant to compensate the plaintiff for living expenses of 40 yuan per month (480 yuan per year), calculated for 40 years, totaling 19,200 yuan, plus a consolation fee of 1,000 yuan, totaling</p>
<p>20,200 yuan. He Kangli is the number one土豪劣绅 in Huarong County, Hunan. He has always used money and power to oppress and引誘 women. I am just one of the people he oppressed and引誘. (After I was 강간 by him, I asked him to marry me formally. He replied to me, "If I play with a woman, I have to get married once, then I don't know how many wives I have." See the criminal court's testimony. I have always believed that</p>
<p>The dignified national law, the wise and upright judge, will give this kind of敗類 appropriate punishment." The case was heard by Judge Li Liang of the Civil Court of the Second Special Court in the seventh court yesterday morning. The plaintiff and her lawyer were present. The defendant Ge Kangli was detained in the detention center and was also brought to court by a bailiff and retained a lawyer to act as his agent. First, according to the plaintiff Luo Xi, also known as Wei Xuezhen, 17 years old, from Changsha, Hunan, currently living in the Hunan Shanghai Primary School on Jumen Road, Nanshi, requesting a judgment ordering the defendant to</p>

She was spotted by Chinese Constable No. 550, who stopped her and took her to the Huishi Police Station. Upon questioning, the girl stated that in May of the year before last, she had been lured to Shanghai by her stepfather, Fang Deqing, who then took her to Gu Fengbao, a Yangzhou woman who ran a brothel at No. 111 Baker Road, and sold her to Gu for 200 yuan. From then on, Gu taught</p>
<p>Sun to dance and sent her to work as a dancer at the Yuegong and Shunfeng dance halls on North Sichuan Road. However, because her career was not going well and her income was meager, Gu forced her to engage in prostitution in January of last year. She lost her virginity to a Mr. Zhang at the Zhongzhou Hotel on Shandong Road. From then on, Gu would send an old woman or a maid named Su Ying to accompany her to various hotels every night to solicit customers, causing her immense suffering. She often thought of escaping this sea of misery but never had the chance. On the night of the 27th of this month, Sun was again called upon to accompany a certain Mr. X, a traveler staying at the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, so Gu ordered Su Ying</p>
<p>to accompany her. Upon arriving at the hotel, Sun excused herself to use the restroom and took the opportunity to escape. She walked to the North Xizang Road Bridge and, thinking that this kind of life was no different from hell, decided to die. Just as she was about to jump into the river, she was stopped by the police. She also stated that Gu Fengbao currently resided at No. 690, Lane 130, Xiamen Road. The police station believed that this case should be handled by the Lao Zha Police Station, so they immediately sent her there. Chinese Detective Qiu Sijiu went and arrested Gu Fengbao, and Su Ying (currently 15 years old) was also present. They were both taken to the police station. It was discovered that Su Ying had also been</p>
<p>bought by Gu. Furthermore, the girl had been raped by Gu's husband when she was 13 years old.

Yesterday morning, she was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court, where Judge Qian Hongye interrogated her. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, explained the situation and charged her under Article 241, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, stating that the police station had found many deeds of sale in the defendant Gu Fengbao's home, indicating that she was in the business of forcing women into prostitution. Therefore, further investigation was needed, and the court was asked to postpone the hearing. The defendant's lawyer, She Yan Li Zhongwen, argued, and Judge Qian, after reviewing the case, decided to postpone the hearing.</p>

The writer paid a special visit yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM. Ms. Gao was packing and graciously agreed to an interview, the outline of which is recorded below. Implementing the ten methods of advance petition is really not an easy task. The first step now is to publicize. The Central Propaganda Department and the Central Photography Studio have already sent people to accompany us along the way. Furthermore, the central government will establish border area party affairs to first carry out publicity work, promote it, and then seek to develop all the rich resources, striving to achieve the three main points of education, upbringing, and healthcare. Although the result of this petition was very good, how to do it is the responsibility of the local government and everyone to cooperate. Furthermore, when we go back, we will visit various places. She said that the people's autonomous factory in Wuxi has the best method and is easy to implement. I will immediately go back and do the same. Therefore, other places must also be visited. During this period in Shanghai, it will be no more than two weeks at most, because Chairman He Jian of the Hunan government has already made several appointments, and it is decided to visit Hunan. There are many Yi and Miao people there, so it is good to meet and discuss development methods. Recently, universities have invited lectures. I am now thinking of reporting the situation of my Yi and Miao people to various universities, and also to investigate the factories and schools in Shanghai.</p>

The original telegram said: "Recently, according to a proposal by Wang Pingnan, the executive director of the association, after the implementation of the legal tender policy by the Ministry of Finance, the national economy has become more stable. Paper money other than that of the Central, China, and Communications Banks in Shanghai has been gradually withdrawn. The credit coupons issued by merchants in various counties of Fujian have also been strictly banned by the provincial government and have been cleared up. The original subsidiary currencies of the three banks circulating in the market have suddenly decreased, while the five-corner, one-corner, and one-corner subsidiary currencies issued by the Fujian Provincial Bank are prevalent among the people. The use of these subsidiary currencies is mostly issued by various agencies affiliated with the provincial government. According to news from the bank, the number of prints in recent years has reached more than five million yuan, which is quite alarming. How much is the capital of the provincial bank, and how much is the reserve fund? Fujian people in Shanghai have not yet received a reliable report. It is a matter of the lifeline of the Fujian people. Please write a letter to investigate the truth." It was also passed by the Standing Committee meeting. A telegram was sent to inquire, hoping that the provincial government and the department will immediately investigate in detail the exact amount of subsidiary currency issued by the bank and the reserve fund to avoid panic among the people.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Our bureau held a public auction of inland waterway vessels on the 22nd of this month. The winning bidders were Li Junqing, Lin Xijin, and Zhang Jinshi. The vessels won were the Xin Wanli, Gongji, and Yuanji, three in total, and the transfer of ownership is currently being processed. However, there are still many vessels that were not successfully bid for. We are continuing to advertise for tenders, and another public auction is scheduled for the 15th of next month. However, in today's news in your newspaper, there is a section entitled ‘First Tender for Inland Merchant Ships Invalid’. This does not correspond to the facts mentioned above. All three tenderers were successful in their bids. We are therefore writing to your newspaper to request that you investigate and correct the record accordingly. Sincerely, The Shipping Department of the State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, March 30th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Recently, we have received letters from many sources informing us that an organization using the name "Chinese Government International Relief Socic" is soliciting donations in this city, claiming that its headquarters is located in the Qingdao city area of Shandong Province. Because its name is similar to ours, many suspect that it is a branch of our association and have inquired about the matter. Lately, social morals are not what they used to be, and unscrupulous individuals often create sham charitable organizations to collect money for their own gain. We therefore consulted the Qingdao Municipal Government to inquire whether such an organization exists within its jurisdiction and whether it has sent personnel to solicit donations outside the area. We have now received a reply stating that there is no such organization in the city. It is clear that unscrupulous bandits are engaging in fraud for profit. We are deeply concerned that the public, unaware of the true situation, will be deceived. We are therefore writing to you to request that you publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section so that the public will be aware. Sincerely, The China International Famine Relief Commission, March 30th, 1937.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>

<h3>Need</h3>
<p>— (Wang Jihua)</p>
<p>The reason for "need" lies in lack: the affluent do not "need".</p>
<p>The prerequisite for "need" lies in envy.</p>
<p>"Need" is the starting point in the history of human evolution.</p>
<p>Before "need" there must be thought, at this time there must be twelve points of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The aftermath of "need" is pursuit, at that time the heart must be filled with infinite hope.</p>
<p>To realize the future purpose of "need", there must be abundant patience.</p>
<p>Near the end of "need", there must be an unspeakable anxiety in the heart.</p>
<p>The final end of "need" is either disappointment or triumph.</p>
<p>"Need" is not desire, unreasonable, inappropriate.</p>
<p>Excessive "need" is greed and insatiability.</p>
<h3>Talking About Marked-Down Green Pillows</h3>
<p>— Pillow Green</p>
<p>“49 cents,” “95 cents,” “$1.98,” “$2.88,” “$4.95,”…</p>
<p>Walking into a department store, looking at the price tags in front of the colorful goods, each one wears an unwavering face with a fixed price. You can't help but feel that the price marked above is more like the amount of a fine or the years of imprisonment under a legal judgment. This is even more conclusive, with no room for protest or appeal.</p>
<p>The numbers on those price tags are so strangely odd, each showing off its different posture, vying for customers' attention. Customers, accustomed to daily contact, are at ease and not surprised, thinking in their floating minds that they are indeed the accurate and appropriate numbers they should take. But if you think about it a little, you will definitely find that most of the odd-numbered price tags are not only accidental, but also subtly grasp the customer's psychology!</p>
<p>Temporarily putting aside the method of intentionally reducing the price by one or two cents, avoiding taxes, and pleasing customers, discarding national obligations for the sake of immediate business interests. In any case, the odd and incomplete numbers can easily make customers' memory fall into a state of confusion. What they remember and can say is often "less than a few yuan" or "a few yuan and change". But taking "$2.88" as an example, this price is not much shorter than the clumsy whole price of "$3", but in people's general concept, it can occupy a lot more winning labor because of this.</p>
<p>Looking at the few price tags mentioned at the beginning, most of them are enough to suggest that there is a higher original price to be calculated by inference, and the current price is the result of a discount, which shows that it is truly cheap.</p>
<p>If you choose that item priced at $2.88, and you happen to have $3 in legal tender in your pocket, enough for the transaction, then you pay according to the price, and you can still get 12 cents in change. This small amount of 'return to the warehouse' does not let you shrink back empty-handed, enough for your transportation home or the price of a pack of cigarettes, isn't it also a way to comfort you that is better than nothing?</p>
<p>The role of such pricing also contains the meaning of life. By extension, enlightening it, it can be said to be all-pervasive and suitable for all applications. For example, even the dignity of the law must allow a person who is being searched or declared bankrupt to retain the tools for his personal life. Even the humblest of young children often kindly return a few coins to a person who has been robbed of everything, so as not to make him walk home barefoot in the cold of the night. Cunning officials seize land only up to eight or nine tenths, still leaving some for the common people to stand on. People in Jiangxi always leave a few grains of rice in the bottom of their bowls when eating. The world is generally like this, this is called "leaving a hand" for others, sharing the thought of "having surplus and not exhausting".</p>
<p>Thoughts turn to fantasy: If our country's diplomacy could adopt this kind of "pricing method", would it be helpful? Come up with a "pricing diplomacy", what is so-called "water bird diplomacy", what kind of diplomacy, etc., why bother to mention it?</p>
<h3>Bird's-Eye View of the Huai River Diversion Project Section — Tu Hongxia</h3>
<p>— Tu Hongxia</p>
<p>To fulfill my long-cherished desire to visit the Huai River diversion project section, on a sunny and breezy day full of spring, I rushed to my destination with two close friends.</p>
<p>In the past, this road was desolate, but now, because of the Huai River diversion project, it is much more lively. In addition to the trees that have not yet turned green, there are also many pedestrians coming and going.</p>
<p>The Huai River diversion is the most recent and greatest project. After more than two years of time and the efforts of hundreds of thousands of workers, the initial phase of the project to divert the river into the sea has not yet been completed. It is said that there are only two months left until the final deadline. The provincial government and the authorities in charge of the Huai River diversion are preparing to release water on May 1st of this year. We believe that this project is indeed related to the water conservancy and agriculture of the entire northern Jiangsu Province. Although it is currently consuming a lot of manpower and financial resources, its future success will bring unlimited benefits.</p>
<p>The organization of the workers is completely militarized, with team leaders, platoon leaders, and company leaders leading the workers to work in an orderly manner. In addition to their work, the remaining time is spent sitting around in reed mats like military tents, chatting, telling stories, and telling jokes to relieve the fatigue of work.</p>
<p>The authorities, in addition to trying their best to make their lives fulfilling, also sometimes gather them to give speeches on the spirit of cooperation. In terms of entertainment, there are also music, movies, and other organizations, so the workers feel very comfortable.</p>
<p>Each worker can earn between one and two jiao of wages per day. In addition to the cost of firewood, rice, and noodles necessary for living, they can still save three to five cents, because many of them live very frugally, mixing coarse grains with rice for cooking, and most of the side dishes are dried radishes and raw salt. This spirit of seeking benefits for the majority and willingly being frugal themselves is truly admirable.</p>
<p>In order to protect the safety of the workers, the authorities have specially dispatched troops and security teams from various counties to take charge, stationed in various places. There are always hundreds of people stationed every mile. At the same time, many clinics have been established, and medicines are supplied by the clinics. The sanitation of the project section is also well-equipped.</p>
<p>Goods arriving at the project section are much more expensive because of the transportation costs along the way and the merchants' greed, but all the necessities of life are available.</p>
<p>There are almost only men on the project section, with very few women. "Journey to the West" has a country of women, and this place has the flavor of a country of men.</p>
<p>The county magistrates of the counties along the river and the district chiefs of each district are almost always supervising the project section. The progress of the project is certainly the crystallization of the workers' blood and sweat, but it is also due to their effective command!</p>
<p>On the way back, I silently prayed for the happiness of these many hardworking workers!</p>
<h3>Records of Human Suffering (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>I usually handled matters on my desk, which was in the children's bedroom: we always had one lamp on together at night, and laughter and the sound of reading echoed each other. My desk was often piled with books, manuscripts, and newspapers like fallen leaves in autumn, and Rong'er always organized them for me. Now, the stack of newspapers and several stacks of miscellaneous books on the windowsill of my desk are the last ones Rong'er organized, and I seem to still see the traces of her hands. Alas, from now on, how can I bear to examine and read them again! Every time I returned from Shanghai, my suitcase was full of manuscripts and letters, which were always unsealed and sorted by my eldest son, Zheng, divided into several categories, and then placed on my desk, waiting for me to select and edit them. If my eldest son was busy with his studies, Rong'er would do it for him. Her work was as orderly as her brother's. Sometimes, seeing something that caught her eye, she would also write articles on children's knowledge and secretly insert them among the other manuscripts to submit. When I selected and read them, I was secretly delighted. I would choose the best ones and publish them in the 'Children's Supplement' to encourage her to improve. The other day, I examined her belongings and actually found two manuscripts in a book, one called 'Clam' and the other 'Sea Urchin', one marked for use in April and the other for use in May, apparently written in advance during her holidays. Alas, Rong'er, how could you know that you would leave this world before the day was out and could not even last until April or May! What is even more painful is that all the manuscripts she had recently written were about aquatic creatures, and she ended up falling into the water and dying, joining the aquatic creatures: every time I think of this, tears fall lightly.</p>
<p>My eldest son and I loved flowers as if they were our lives, and Rong also loved them: whenever it was time to plant flowers and trees, she would always help us. Last winter, I obtained an ancient plum tree stump from the mountains. Half of the massive trunk was hollow, and it was probably several hundred years old. I brought it back and planted it in a giant pot, reclining it in the shape of a hanging cliff. Rong then chose the branches and trunks that had not withered and carefully carved them one by one, making them look like dry trunks, full of artistic intent. I was overjoyed and praised her warmly, and then had her carve all the other small plum tree stumps, all of which were successfully completed. One day, Rong saw me planting pines, bamboos, and plums in broken pottery jars, and she imitated me, finding half of a broken flowerpot, carving it into the shape of a boat, and transplanting three clumps of violets onto it, adding a piece of stone for support. It was naturally picturesque. I was even more delighted and kept it in the greenhouse, watering it frequently. The other day, I painfully took it out to look at it, and the leaves were all fresh green, and the buds were about to bloom. I immediately placed it on the porch and asked my family to take care of it, so that it would be a permanent memento. How could I have known that when I looked at it the next morning, one clump in the middle had withered: could it be that the flowers also had knowledge and were making this painful expression? In the summer, the gardeners were busy cultivating chrysanthemums and had no time to take care of other things; Rong would wear a broken straw hat and old leather shoes every evening and go with her brother to draw water from the pond and carry it to water the garden, often with sweat on her body and her trousers wet with water, and she was content. Alas, Rong'er, who would have known that the pond from which you used to draw water to irrigate the garden would be the place where you died today! In the past, Jingwei carried stones to fill the sea of hatred; this pond is also my sea of hatred: I will wait until the period of mourning for my child has passed, and her soul returns, and I will hire workers to transport mud and fill this evil pond, to atone for my child.</p>
<p>Rong'er was strong from a young age and never suffered from any illnesses. She was bold and could endure pain: if a fleshy growth appeared under her chin, she would pluck it out, blood would gush out, but she would not care. One day, she was racing with her classmates at school and lost her footing and fell to the ground, and the skin on both her knees was broken like the size of a palm, with coal dust embedded in the flesh. Rong then removed it herself, applying iodine. The pain was excruciating, but she endured it silently, fearing that her mother would find out. Later, her mother saw it by chance and comforted her for her pain, but Rong only smiled it off. I then said to Fengjun: This child is bold and ruthless, and could become a surgeon in the future to save the world and help people. How could I have known that she would die prematurely and abandon her loving parents!</p>
<h3>Reincarnated Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 12: White Tablet and Red Paper Vainly Return Two Lines of Tears, Reed Flowers and Maple Leaves Alone Walk Half a City of Autumn</p>
<p>Guoqi could tell that he was forcing a smile when he arrived. Now that he was saying goodbye, he had the same forced composure, so he didn't try to persuade him to stay. He walked with his head down towards the alleyway, and kept walking until he reached the entrance, then he turned back to look. He didn't seem to expect that Guoqi would still be standing at the gate. At first, he was shocked, but then he stopped, smiled, and nodded, saying, "Please go back." He figured that Guoqi would still be standing at the gate, so he didn't turn back again. After that one turn, he seemed to have a strong feeling. Between people, there is always that "fate" that Buddhists talk about. With fate, things go well, whether it's making friends, or even marriage between a man and a woman. Without fate, no matter how close people are, they can't succeed in anything. Guoqi hadn't even had a conversation with Menglan, and yet they had become the kind of friends who would live and die for each other. From this point of view, you can't force anything. There's a reason for this. It's also a case of getting twice the result with half the effort to help those who are destined for each other. He and Menglan had such a good friendship, so he would try to put in a little more effort for them. Thinking like this, he felt like he had a load off his mind. He decided that he would meet Menglan at school the next day and go to his house together. With this in mind, he deliberately went to school earlier the next day, hoping to have a contact with Menglan before class. But he didn't come in the morning, and he still didn't come in the afternoon. After school, Youmei simply grabbed his bag and headed to the Jiang's house. As soon as he entered, he met Xiaoju, who said, "Miss Li, you've come at the right time. Our lady is sick again." Youmei said, "Sick again? Why?" Xiaoju smiled and said, "Being sick is just being sick, why does there have to be a reason?" Youmei paused and smiled, "That's my mistake. I'll just go straight to her room, don't bother anyone else." So he lightened his steps, crossed several houses, and went upstairs. When he was upstairs, he was almost to Menglan's room, he was careless, and made his footsteps heavy, and the leather shoes stepped on the stairs with a thud. Then he heard Menglan say in the room: Xiaoju, I told you not to come upstairs and disturb me, why are you here again? Youmei laughed: The one who came is not chrysanthemum, but plum blossom, are you welcome? Menglan heard this, and went straight to the door to greet him, took his hand, and said with a wry smile: I was looking forward to you coming, you really came. Very good! With that, he pulled him into the room. (152)</p>
<h3>On the Revival of Kun Opera (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of facts, the reason why Kun opera is not easily understood by people is definitely not because of the depth of the lyrics, but because the scripts of Kun opera are not widely circulated and too few people know about them. Because they do not understand the plot, they are not easily interested. For example, people who do not understand English often like to watch foreign sound films. How can they understand the dialogue of the characters in the play? It is only because they read the synopsis first and have a full understanding of the plot that they can understand the expressions of the characters in the play, and thus develop an interest. Even people like us who understand a little American English, and ordinary people in the West, do not understand most of the singing in sound films, but their interest is not diminished at all. Therefore, if we want to save Kun opera from extinction today, the first thing we must not do is to scare people with high-sounding arguments such as "high art is only appreciated by a few". Secondly, we must distribute the lyrics in the theatre (the lyrics should be preceded by a brief summary of the entire plot) to increase the audience's interest.</p>
<p>However, the symptoms of Kun opera are already deep, and these two points alone can only prevent further deterioration. If we want it to flourish and expand, I think there are still several points that must be paid attention to:</p>
<p>(1) Add scenery: It is an undeniable fact that scenery can increase the audience's interest. For example, the garden tour in "Peony Pavilion", although the lyrics and expressions are already extremely beautiful, if we can add a garden scene, then its moving power will be doubled!</p>
<p>(2) Delete vaudeville: Not every scene in Kun opera is wonderful. Scenes such as "Beating Chen Cha", "Beating the Flower Drum", and "Major and Minor Frauds" can be said to be extremely boring and are most likely to give the audience a bad impression. They should be deleted and not performed.</p>
<p>(3) Rehearse new plays: I have read "The Ten Plays of Sheng Weng", "The Melody Score of the Eyun Pavilion", "The Legend of the Jade Lion Hall", etc., and I deeply feel that there are countless excellent plays that have not yet been performed by the Kun opera troupes today. In the future, those who study this art should not be afraid of hard work and should learn more new plays to make up for the bias and lack of today.</p>
<p>(4) Enhance the music: Kun opera has always been accompanied by the haidi flute, which is a bit monotonous. It should be accompanied by sheng, xiao, moon guitar, pipa, etc. Then the various sounds will resonate, and there will be a wonderful sound that you will never tire of hearing.</p>

<h3>More on the Spanish Civil War</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>Up to now, the Fascist side in the Spanish Civil War has not been able to completely occupy Madrid or completely eliminate the government forces, so it cannot be considered an absolute victory. To go one step further, it can be considered a 'mishap', because when the Spanish rebels raised their flags, they were in a fierce momentum, sweeping everything away, with the intention of annihilating their enemies in one go. But now that many days have passed, and the two sides have been winning and losing each other, rising and falling alternately, there is a great tendency to be deadlocked. This kind of power is naturally not the power of General Franco on the one hand, nor the power of the government forces on the other hand. Therefore, the success of General Franco this time is not the success of General Franco, but the success of the Fascist party. The failure of General Franco is not the failure of General Franco, but the failure of the Fascist party.</p>
<p>'Hitting a crying child, adults show up', this kind of situation has the possibility of evolving into a world war, but the reason why it has not yet evolved into a world war is because the time is not ripe. Since the European War, countries have learned from their pain and are inevitably disheartened. In addition, their vitality has been damaged and they urgently need to recuperate, so they have not had active preparations for military affairs. Only Germany and Italy have been preparing for war, burying their heads in hard work. Until last year, although they cannot be said to have absolute military preparations, they have had considerable military preparations. Therefore, once Germany rearmed and reclaimed lost territory, and Italy went on an expedition to Abyssinia, the English and French countries were almost at a loss. Therefore, the reason why the Spanish campaign did not turn into a second world war is due to this reason.</p>
<p>Although the non-Fascist faction is very weak towards the Fascist faction and dares not actively restrain it, the Spanish Civil War is a great area for comparing the skills of the two sides. The Fascist faction used the most modern weapons and full military support to help the rebels, but up to now, news of the government forces' victory is still coming from time to time, so the power of the Fascist faction can be imagined. And the non-Fascist faction still has considerable power, but the reason why the non-Fascist side is cautious in doing this is that if the war expands, the world will inevitably suffer, and this kind of price is immeasurable. Therefore, they have to take a patient attitude. Another reason is that they do not have absolute confidence in winning if a war breaks out, so they are expanding their military while perfunctorily compromising. The reason why the situation has not become extremely serious for a while lies in this.</p>
<p>But the Fascist faction believes that the attitude of the non-Fascist faction has softened and they dare not break with them, so they are flexing their muscles and acting freely, knowing that the time is not to be lost. If the non-Fascist faction has military preparations and unites as one, there will be no room for development. Therefore, if there is a possibility of causing a world war, it is not only the Spanish case, but also the September 18th Incident, the German army's entry into the Rhineland, and the Abyssinian expedition. They are all fuses for world wars. But although they have been lucky enough to escape now, there will always be a day when the two sides fight each other. That day will inevitably get closer and closer.</p>
<h3>Boating</h3>
<p>— Lin Di</p>
<p>Our boat has been sailing for three days already.</p>
<p>The boat is fully loaded with heavy cargo: tobacco leaves, betel nuts, white sugar, large barrels of raw oil... the narrow boat is so crammed that there is almost no space to sleep, the boat is sinking so heavily in the sea!</p>
<p>Old Jin and I – we've been partners for a long time – rely on this boating to sell goods for a living. We sail along the hazy, green coastline, peddling our goods along the way, until everything is sold – this is our entire life.</p>
<p>Old Jin slowly rows the oars, fragrant water lilies float past with the rushing water. Tiny droplets of water splash under the oars. I hold the rudder, my bare legs crossed high: we are often calculating, planning, falling into a deathly silence. Our thoughts never leave our business, how can we make ourselves richer? Life is too hard!</p>
<p>'Old Jin, that debt from XX Company, they've been chasing us for it several times, what do you plan to do?'</p>
<p>'What else can we do? We can only wait until the grains are harvested.' Sweat has already flowed from Old Jin's broad, purple forehead, at this moment suddenly furrowing - slightly. His hands still row the oars tirelessly, the boat is too heavy, Old Jin seems to be struggling quite a bit.</p>
<p>'Qi Mao (the native's name) the hundred dollars of credit he owed last year, we have to sue him in court. Damn it, it's too much, the grain in the warehouse is all gone, but he's hiding it from us and not paying back.' Old Jin has mentioned this several times. This time, because someone is pressing us for debt, he angrily remembered that cunning fellow, Qi Mao.</p>
<p>'Let's think of a solution when we get back, anyway...' I grumbled impatiently, I was also annoyed by that hundred dollars – a large sum for us.</p>
<p>Then we both fell silent with our worries. The sound of the oars hitting the water, Old Jin's heavy breathing, seemed too desolate on this vast Irrawaddy River. The boat was pushed forward by the waves, the blue sky covered the boundless water, our boat was so small, in order to sell the goods quickly and rush back to replenish them, even if we encountered headwind, we could only struggle with manpower.</p>
<p>Whenever the boat arrived at a small village, we were familiar with them: we slowly moored the boat to the shore, greeted some old customers, the narrow boat was temporarily extremely lively. Sounds of greetings, sounds of weighing goods, noises of arguing over prices, all mixed into one. Some hypocritical courtesies, we could use them at this time, deception was also very common for us. Old Jin packed the goods, his face flushed:</p>
<p>'XX, one catty of white sugar, tobacco leaves...'</p>
<p>Quickly, I recorded the accounts in the running ledger. We also had to take advantage of the spare time to run around collecting debts. What was left was cooking, which was not at a fixed time. Some coarse rice, a plate of stinky fish sauce, was our daily meal. Then, we started the boat again and moved towards the endless journey. Life was so tasteless.</p>
<p>In July and August, the sea waves are very big. But our boating must continue. Often, the boat was difficult to move forward due to the large waves, and we did not reach the predetermined place, and the dark night attacked us. We had to moor the boat near the barren shoal, insert the bamboo pole deep into the water, and tie the boat and the bamboo pole together with hemp rope. The small kerosene lamps were all turned off, for fear of attracting attention. In these places, we often encountered robbers who came to rob and seize; they would rob all the money and goods, and even stab you with a bright knife and push the body into the water. This kind of massacre was often played out in this area, and every boatman had to be wary in advance. Quietly, with a worried heart, we took turns on night watch, the night seemed to deliberately make things difficult for us, creeping past without a sound moment by moment. In our minds, amazing scenes played out, the sound of leaves falling from trees, or fruits falling from trees, would startle us to trembling. The water flowed gurgling under the boat, the sky was full of stars, the sea was vast, shining in the darkness, and the time was approaching dawn.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, life never changed for us. We struggled in hardship, time slipped by year after year, and we still lived a bleak boating life. Sea waves, bitter rain, deathly loneliness, we were all already tired of.</p>
<p>Note 1: There are many overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and Burma who live this kind of boating life. They carry goods to various small villages to peddle, one trip after another, without end.</p>
<p>Note 2: When boat merchants sell goods to natives, they rarely get cash. Mostly, they put the debt on credit and wait until the grain is harvested, then they repay with grains.</p>
<h3>Rain</h3>
<p>— Bai Yan</p>
<p>A small watermelon-shaped boat emerged from under the bridge. At the bow and stern were men wearing straw raincoats and bamboo hats, holding bamboo poles. The boat was being propelled very quickly, and in just two or three strokes it was in front of me. The man at the bow was the boatman named Wang Xiao San. I waved and asked him:</p>
<p>'Going down the river in this weather?'</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<h3>Page 19</h3>
<p>'Whether it's good or bad, there's no business. The water is high downstream, so I'm just rowing for fun.'</p>
<p>His words piqued my interest, and I said I'd go along. He hesitated for a moment, then asked if I had a raincoat. I said I didn't bring one, but even if it rained, I wouldn't mind getting a little wet. He shook his head, but another boatman suddenly volunteered:</p>
<p>'I'll go borrow a raincoat?'</p>
<p>They brought the boat to the shore, and the boatman ran into the village. Sure enough, after a while, he came back with a raincoat, and even brought a hat.</p>
<p>After getting on the boat, the sky became even darker, and a wind picked up on the lake. If not for the raincoat, I would definitely feel cold. When the boat passed the Peach Garden, I didn't see the hunchbacked, strange old beggar. That old fellow often made people laugh. When he saw students, he would shake his head and recite Tang poetry. When he saw someone wearing a Zhongshan suit or a diagonal leather belt, he would sing 'The National Revolution Succeeded'.</p>
<p>The boat arrived at Rainbow Bridge. The bridge opening was extremely low, and the people on the boat had to lower their heads to pass through. The water had risen a lot this year, and even the bamboo forest was submerged in water. The lotus pond was already connected to the lake, and the large goldfish that were originally in the pond had all gone. Only the largest opening in the middle of the Five Pavilion Bridge could be passed by a boat, and the other small openings were all hidden below the water's surface. The boatman said that this was all because of the rain. The river tide hadn't risen yet, so the water was still green. If the river water flowed in, it would become yellow.</p>
<p>The embankment, which was originally lined with willow trees and peach blossoms, was now also submerged in water. The lake surface seemed to be twice as large as usual. I thought about going around the mountain promontory to visit the monk who had been to university and also suffered a broken heart, but halfway there, the rain poured down. I had to turn back halfway. The boatman asked:</p>
<p>'Do you want to find a place to take shelter from the rain?'</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>'With a raincoat and hat, why take shelter from the rain? We might as well row in the rain for a while.'</p>
<p>Both boatmen laughed and said 'Okay'.</p>
<p>Raindrops hit the water surface, each one stirring up a large cluster of bubbles. The lake surface looked like it was boiling. The water, which usually looked like a mirror, now seemed to be covered with white feathers, fluttering in the wind. The rain sprinkled on the boat, the water, and the hat, all with a loud sound, but when it fell on the raincoat, it became a pleasant whisper. The rain was very dense, and water kept dripping down from the hat in front of my face. People in the rain saw everything as if through a heavy curtain, or like through a layer of frosted glass. More distant scenery seemed to be wrapped in mist. Looking back at the blue mountain in front, it was vaguely there and not there.</p>
<h3>Spring Outing</h3>
<p>— Tian Qing</p>
<p>The spring scenery of the South is embroidered with intoxicating curtains.</p>
<p>Probably because of the climate, the creeping grass has already turned green all over the wilderness. The weeping willows have drawn out soft, emerald green whips, dancing their waists wildly in the breeze.</p>
<p>The peach blossoms have all bloomed, and the waters of the Magnolia Creek have also flooded. The gray geese exploring the spring water have already paddled their golden-yellow webbed feet, swimming leisurely on the water like boat girls. The fisherman has finished repairing his broken net and is re-loading his four bamboo poles arranged into a small raft, wandering on the shallow beach, ready to cast his net at any time. The cormorant squats on the bow of the raft, pretending to sleep – listening quietly to the sound of fish splashing in the water. Young people resent the cormorant's viciousness. But this is the true meaning of life, adding a vivid character to the scene of nature.</p>
<p>The rattan rafts coming from upstream are lined up into small islands. The girls washing clothes on the rafts naturally expose their legs and arms, gently pounding with wooden pestles. The people under the peach shade on the shore intentionally look down at the floating clouds at the bottom of the water, but frequently squint at the innocent face. Suddenly, the heavier sound of the pestle agitates the ripples on the water surface. Is the girl deliberately acting coquettishly? The ripples obscure that alluring inverted reflection. Making that passionate and joyful heart ripple slightly with anxious waves: the fire of youth burns and troubles his mind. In this embrace of nature, he forgets that he is still a person... Swallows draw silver arcs in pairs under the azure sky, dancing freely with steps that are not easily imitated, chirping and singing the tune of cherishing spring. Sometimes they gently skim across the surface of the water, making one suspect that they are a pair of lovebirds committing suicide, but they are all coming to show off this pair of beautiful shadows, and lightly fly to the horizon again. Those who are infatuated feel even more endless admiration and jealousy.</p>
<p>Everything in spring is full of intense vitality, even the night-blooming jasmine on the wall stretches out its soft, emerald green leaves, nurturing a fine bud, preparing to compete with the spring scenery.</p>
<p>The people going on a spring outing bring prepared offerings and gifts, carry ethnic lanterns, and climb in groups onto the mountain where their ancestral graves are located. Young people hold their most joyful partners and revel in the deep mountains and wilderness. Although there is no snow in the South, there is a riot of fallen flowers, spreading crimson over the green meadows of the wilderness. The partridge coos affectionately in the secluded forest, further intensifying the feeling of spring. The elderly quietly climb to the graves of their relatives, remove the overgrown weeds, level the flat ground in front of the graves, reverently offer sacrifices, kowtow, and calculate the feng shui that the 'geomancer' told them about. What kind of fortune will they have to follow this year? Then they cast a string of joyful and hopeful smiles, or disappointed and worried sighs. They also trace some of the deeds of their ancestors, lament for a while about the rights and wrongs of the current world, and also teach the young people to strive for honor for their ancestors.</p>
<p>All these childhood spring scenes are engraved very vividly and actively in my memory. But for several years, the spring scenery of my hometown has not belonged to me. I just trample on the cement pavements of the city, looking at the stupid street trees without any young buds: this place called the South, the green of the fragrant grass, is actually a sparse dream.</p>
<p>The beautiful spring scenery, it's time for a spring outing again. I remotely cherish my hometown three thousand miles away, recalling the fun of spring outings in my childhood, and even more missing the weeds on my father's grave, has anyone come to level them?</p>

<h3>The Relationship Between Vehicle Traffic and Streetlights</h3>
<p>— Shuo</p>
<p>The Special Effect of New Lights</p>
<p>Whether streetlights are good or not is greatly related to the safety of vehicle traffic. Mr. Robinson, an electrical engineer in Liverpool, England, recently wrote an article discussing this issue, and his views are insightful. I will translate the main points below for the reference of those who are concerned about this issue.</p>
<p>The original purpose of installing public streetlights was to prevent theft on the roads. Today, in addition to preventing crime and promoting business, its greatest purpose is to facilitate road traffic and increase safety. Recently, as road traffic has become increasingly prosperous and highway construction is expensive, the problem of streetlights must be paid attention to in order for this investment to benefit in the future. Otherwise, dangers will arise, and the roads cannot be fully used. How can one expect to profit when it's like climbing a tree to catch fish?</p>
<p>The time from dusk to dawn in a year accounts for 45 percent. And during this dim period, the traffic on the road accounts for 40 percent of the total traffic. In addition, the busiest time for vehicle traffic every day is at night, when drivers are often fatigued from a day's work, which greatly affects their driving. The prosperity of commercial vehicle traffic on the roads all night is also increasing year by year.</p>
<p>Based on the above facts, it is very possible that night traffic can cause accidents and fatalities. The difference between this problem and daytime traffic is also very obvious. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, in addition to car headlights, we should focus on streetlights. It is difficult to solve the problem of car lights and traffic, and even the glare of car headlights can cause accidents. Therefore, drivers often dim their headlights when driving.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the safety of streetlights and road traffic, there is no accurate statistical material to be found in the United Kingdom. However, in the United States, there are many references. There are many examples where the accident rate has been reduced due to the solution of the streetlight problem. In some places, the original state of daytime accidents can be maintained, but the number of night accidents has increased instead. In addition, various statistics before and after the installation of streetlights show the benefits of streetlights. Generally, the accident rate can be reduced by 41 percent where there are streetlights. According to facts, half of the accidents in 24 hours occur at night. Therefore, after installing effective streetlights, the protection of safety, life, and money is very significant.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, the lighting installation of rural roads has not yet been very effective. The more prominent ones are in short sections of roads, and the streetlight styles are not uniform. This is because the management authorities are not consistent on a section of the road, so it is very difficult to achieve safety. In addition, it is not fair to ask small villages to bear the entire cost of streetlights, because the local traffic is not prosperous. Now the authorities use the amount of road use as the basis for the distribution of expenses, which is considered fair.</p>
<p>It may be worthwhile to talk about what is called an appropriate streetlight plan. First, we must know the relationship between roads and objects. Anyone who wants to ensure the safety of the road surface should take the ability to clearly see objects on the road surface as the only condition. During the day, objects and their environment, and their color efficiency, make extremely clear contrasts. But under any artificial light, the color contrast completely fails. Only brightness can be sought. Even in broad daylight, the contrast between the brightness of objects on the road and the road surface appears dark. This is partly due to the direction of the light and partly because even though roads and objects receive the same light, objects are often darker than roads. Due to the manifestation of this fact, in road lighting equipment, it is often desired that objects receive as little light as possible, while the road surface should be illuminated more to make objects appear darker on the bright road surface.</p>
<p>It is not easy to achieve the above-mentioned ideal in practice. However, as a result of careful research, some light source tools have finally been obtained that are deeply practical. Among them, the sodium lamp, which uses electrical emission, is used more widely. This light is a soft golden yellow and is easy to distinguish. In many ways, this sodium lamp can solve the difficult problems of streetlights. The golden light can increase visual clarity, because the eyes of ordinary people are clearer under this special light. Therefore, the above-mentioned contrast between objects and the road surface becomes more clear. Economically speaking, under the same consumption as ordinary lights, the brightness can be increased five times, and its durability can be increased three times.</p>
<p>If you want to obtain the greatest visibility under any kind of lighting, the first thing you must do is eliminate the glare. For example, if a mesh reflector is suspended in the middle of the road and sodium lamps are used, the effect of the light is like daylight. Then all glare can be found. Everything on the road and sidewalk is extremely clear. If a road has such streetlights, headlights can be eliminated, and its safety and reliability will be beyond doubt.</p>
<h3>The Second Batch of 1937 "Welcome Happiness" Baby Cars Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>The 1937 "Welcome Happiness" Baby Car. Since the first batch arrived in Shanghai. Sold out in an instant. This is because the new car's reliable construction. Reasonable pricing. And the economy of driving and maintenance costs. Is even more advanced than before. Therefore, it is very popular among the automotive industry in this city. According to Mr. Yang Hansan, the Chinese manager of the car's distributor, Continental Motors Company, No. 997 Jing'an Temple Road, the second batch of new cars will arrive in Shanghai soon. Therefore, it is eagerly disclosed to inform readers.</p>
<h3>Airplane-Style New Automobile</h3>
<p>▲Recently, automobile manufacturing. Many parts have adopted airplane techniques. Even in terms of form. Many are similar to the latest types of airplanes. As shown in the picture. Is a French car called 'Panhard'. This car was exhibited at the Paris Motor Show. And received much attention. (Y)</p>
<h3>Overview of the American Automobile Industry in the Past Year (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Passenger car sales. In fact, this year is not as stable as truck sales. Generally speaking, in the United States. The automobile market. Can be divided into four seasons a year. But trucks, as everyone knows, have no seasonal divisions. Regardless of the first or second half of the year. Sales are always very stable. Every year. There are four or five months. Roughly from April to August. The registration numbers for each month are extremely stable. Without much fluctuation. But in winter. Truck sales will have special development. This year, the sales of trucks from various American factories. Are also distributed more evenly than in previous years. Because in the past few years of recession. It can be said that most of the trucks sold. Were manufactured by the four major automobile factories. And small automobile factories accounted for only a very small number. But this year is an exception. Because according to general estimates, the four major automobile factories accounted for 89 percent of all trucks sold in the United States in 1936. And 92 percent in 1935. The so-called independent small automobile factories. Were able to improve their position this year. On the one hand, because in addition to heavy-duty trucks. They also manufactured light-duty trucks. And this year, heavy-duty trucks were competing more fiercely in the market. Most truck buyers ordered special bodies. Mounted on the chassis. As for the chassis. Of course, they were also purchased from truck manufacturers. And the bodies were made by general automobile factories. Among them, many were the result of trial use in the previous year. And had achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>Finally, what we want to say is that American factories. Have mostly finalized their car manufacturing plans for 1937. Studebaker and Packard fully adopted the latest methods. To manufacture new cars. Recently, they have been publicly sold in the market. Buick held a sales conference at the Flint General Factory in the first week of October. Gathering managers and car dealers from all over the country, as well as representatives from the factory, to discuss the business policies for 1937. As a result, it has been decided to expand the scope of car sales in various parts of the United States. In early October. Several automobile factories exhibited prototypes of the new cars for 1937. To show that the new cars for next year will be manufactured according to the prototypes. At least two automobile factories. Had already decided on the manufacturing of the new cars at that time. Following the exhibition of the new cars. Public exhibitions were held one after another in various parts of the United States in the last two months. (The End)</p>
