<h3>我代表向九國公約會議宣布和平須以條約為基礎</h3>
<p>否則玷汚世界文明我决抵抗到底　李維諾夫主以切實辦法懲處侵略</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　九國公約會議昨日午後開會時、中國首席代表顧維鈞卽席致詞、措辭溫和、此次會議英美法三國對於中日戰事尋求和平解决辦法之主旨、完全和洽無間顧氏稱“中國祈求和平但在日本侵略繼續進行之時、中國决將抵抗到底、藎任何代價之和平、非但中國不能獲得公道、卽於文明亦無裨益、和平必須以九國公約第一條為根據、吾人深知諸君均信條約神聖之原則、敢以中國政府全心全意之合作相貢獻”、</p>
<p>蘇聯代表李維諾夫繼起致詞、大會卽於六時十五分休止、並定於今日二時三十分、由各委員會單獨舉行秘密會議、據最近所得消息、九國公約會議尚擬作最後之努力、以取得任何形式之日本合作、但衆覺日本之企圖、實絕少變更之望、日本方面昨夜復聲言、日方事先已奉有訓令、對於參加會議之任何新請求、一概拒絕、惟關係各國代表不願在會議初步中、卽拋却任何可能途徑、因尚擬作萬一之企圖、此後行動、今尚未有何决定、惟會塲休息室中盛傳、各國擬推舉英美兩國出任調處、推英美兩國是否願担當此項勞而無功之責任、以及條件提出時是否能為日本所接受、殊無把握、</p>
<p>顧維鈞昨日演說中復曾提及日本武力侵略之事實、曾經二十三國代表、詳細審查其報吿書後、卽經五十一國一致通過、證實日本軍隊已侵入中國領土、佔領廣泛區域、北平亦在其內、日本政府並已派遣海軍、封鎖中國海岸、復以大軍壓力、在陸海空三方加害中國無辜平民、日本軍事佔領之中國土地、包括冀•察•綏三全省及晋魯兩省之一部份、其面積幾及英德兩國版圖、目前戰爭之發生、為日本一九三一年瀋陽事變以來佔領東三省後、侵略政策之繼續、實已毫無疑義、顧氏復稱、“中國所抱憾者、卽近年以來之軍備整頓、未能更迅速而廣泛、俾對侵略得予以更有效之抵抗、而使國內民衆被慘殺之數目得以減少云、顧氏繼謂、“日本屢言、遠東局勢、西方人難於了解、實則唯一難於了解者、卽日本一意孤行之侵略、不惟食言而肥、且與其本身之利益、亦相牴觸耳、日本復時責中國缺少强有力之政府、但在其本國政府之內、文人今日所宣稱之和平意旨、明日卽為其軍人之行動證實其處偽、故於日本亦無利益、”顧氏復提及華北大規模之走私運動、謂其目的在使中國政府遭受經濟打擊、在華北造成中國之分裂、而增强日本在該地之控制、關於日本之拒絕參加九國公約會議、顧氏認為更足證明日本蔑棄條約義務、日本假使有理可言、而捫心無愧、實不必畏懼其理論之不為人諒解、顧氏對於中國境內排日民氣之存在、並不否認、且聲明排日實為日本侵略當然之結果、至如日方所稱中國政府受共產份子操縱一層則可一笑置之、李維諾夫演說、警吿各國、謂國際會議、有時反為侵略者所利用、尤以會議無期延長為可盧、蓋各國所最關切者、或僅為維持自身之存在、或為會議發起者取得道德上之滿足、或僅求表面上之成功、而與主義之成功無關、彼信本會議必能以恢復遠東之和平、建立公正之和平、循其目標前進、如是則侵略者之手、將不致放縱、而更加以束縛、凡此所言、非但為今日、且為將來、非但為遠東、為世界其他各部份云、（中央社四日路透電）</p>
<p>九國公約會議昨日午後開會時、首由蘇聯人民外交委員長李維諾夫發表演說、對於美國代表台維斯所持見解、表示贊同、並謂、關於抵抗侵略國一項問題、蘇聯所採取之立塲、係以愛好和平之觀念為依據、渠前已迭次加以說明、其他各國見解、當亦從同、特如何乃可不以空言譴責侵略國、而採取切實辦法、以保障或恢復和平、此則困難所在耳、今茲九國公約會議、乃因討論防止侵略行動與恢復和平局勢兩項問題而召集、此其精神上意義、自極重大、“愛好和平各國、亟應團結一致、以對付侵略國、並望九國公約會議、提出各種建議、俾得恢復和平局勢、並懲處侵略國、以儆效尤”、</p>
<p>中國首席代表顧維鈞博士繼起發言、略謂、“九國公約會議所由召集者、乃因締約國之一卽日本、違反該公約第一條、而用武力侵略中國、遂致產生現行局勢”、九國公約第七條曾經載明、遇有某種情形發生、牽涉該約規定之適用問題時、締約各國應完全坦白互相通知、此乃締約各國之權利、抑亦職責之所在、今茲日本拒不參加會議、徒足以再度證明該國弁髦條約義務而已”、顧氏並謂、日本所謂該國願與中國合作、並非眞相、“任何人欲與鄰居締交者、斷無摑其頰迫某屈膝、而謀加以殺害者也”、嗣談及中國與其他各國間關係、則謂、自各國放棄往昔所行政策以還、種種困難、為之一掃而淸、中國得與各國在自由眞誠與友好的環境下、進行合作、中國經濟狀况、不斷發展之餘、雙方均蒙其利、“惟有日本墨守古舊思想、欲以發展經濟為口、實、而遂其控制中國之政策、此項殘忍而不適時宜之政策、日本若一日不予以放棄並代以平等與互惠之原則、則中日兩國卽一日無眞正合作之可能、抑此項合作事業、與門戶開放原則、互相適合實不應限於日本、而當推及其地各國也、中國在已往數閱月中、不惜極大犧牲、其對於國際法律與秩序、裨益實非淺鮮”、至是、顧維鈞博士申說中國對於現行條約其有神聖性質一項原則、信守不渝、此在各國、凡出席九國公約會議者、當亦亟欲有以保障之、“目前遠東方面侵略力量、猶如溜韁之馬、若不能用有效方法、加以控制、又諾言之信仰心、若不能予以恢復、深恐侵略力量、將越過中國邊彊、而鼓動世界大戰、屆時任何國均不能處身事外、而不被牽入漩渦矣、吾人為一般和平利益、並為各國安全着想、希望中國獲得公允待遇、敬祝會議工作、克底於成、此在吾人自當竭力為之援助”、結論則謂、中國仍當英勇抗戰、種種窒碍、均非所願云、</p>
<p>葡萄牙國代表嘉斯德羅最後發言、略謂、葡國在遠東方面、係有重大利益、自中日兩國糾紛發生之後、葡國卽曾聲明中立、但“九國公約會議、茍能依據此國政府請柬內所說明之目標、决定何項行動、而與調處工作有利、葡國均凖備加以贊助”云、（中央社四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>白魯塞爾　九國公約國會議意代表阿爾杜魯文迪、今晨與德日葡三國駐比大使會談、交換九國會議成立兩委員會問題之意見、聞意代表會邀請德日參加、但被拒絕、故意國苟無德日之參加、將拒絕參加任何委員會云、（四日中央社電）</p>

<p>自魯塞爾　九國公約會議各國代表本日在會外所討論者、乃以美國所提出再度邀請日本一項建議為主、但類皆以日本仍復拒絕為慮、爰乃主張僅在外交上與日本政府進行談話、俾該國縱不派員出席會議、至少亦能發生較為妥協之聲明、用以說明究在何種條件之下、始可接受調解、關於此層、各國代表明日午後二時三十分舉行非公開會議時、自當加以討論、至於委托某某數國担任調處一節、則當俟諸異日、特各國代表進行談話時、曾擬依照一九三二年上海戰事之前例、委托英•法•美•意•四國担任調處、届時意國若果謝絕、則英•法•美•三國仍當逕自為之、此外、九國公約會議明日開會或當依照美國提議、指派範圍較小之委員會、而不以中國列在委員之中、俾與日本政府進行接洽、本星期內、全體會議亦當暫行停開、以待該委員會與日本進行談判之結果、英國外相艾登•法國外長台爾博斯均定於本月五日遄返本國、（中央社三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日本侵略中國有如盤石上山</h3>
<p>暫時前進終必自墜　英報評論會議情形</p>
<p>［倫敦］泰晤士報駐比京特派員來電、報吿昨日九國公約會議情形、謂中國首席代表顧維鈞、以適邏輯不亢不卑之尊嚴論調、陳述中國理由、聞其言者、莫不動容、孟却斯德指導報稱、國際會議之開幕、從未有如此次之唱唱望和者、此會之立卽結果、或為中日雙方之允開和議、但着手議和之基礎、則雙方對之、殊未必能同意也、吾人須知、抵抗侵略者乃中國、而非九國公約會議、苟日本繼續侵略、則中國抵抗何時可止、唯中國能言之耳、至於打破此種僵局之談判、九國公約會議應立卽向國聯大會報吿、庶國聯大會可研究决議案所規定之其他可能辦法、將來勝利終屬弱者、縱日本北抵黃河、南據上海、然仍須繼續作戰、與初開戰時無異、盤石上山、終將自墜、日本其將為其自已勝利所打倒歟、是以九國會議或可運用其勢力或壓力、以促日本之反省云、（中央社四日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］每日電報今日特著一文、概括估計九國公約會議之價值、稱“所謂九國公約會議、能自阻碍和平途徑之不良環境中、為其慈善之目的、攫取多量之成功、實須至健壯之樂觀者始能相信之”、該報復稱、昨日各國代表之演說、或能有一良好之成效、卽可使日本輿論了解、會議非但事先毫無成見、並否認有裁判之意、會議中各國代表旣給以此種担保、日本或可相當滿意、但中國方面之滿意、當亦必隨之而減少云、（中央社四日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］九國公約會議、頃由英國各報加以評論、每日電聞報載稱、“國聯會對於日本侵略行動前此加以譴責之後、日本即以草草判决為口實、而拒不參加九國公約會議、迄至今日、吾人若謂此項會議能有偌大成就、未免過分樂觀、但吾人旣已簽訂一種條約、自未便規避此一條約所明定之義務、茲吾人旣已履行此種義務、則不問會議成功與否、均可問心無塊、”新聞記事報載稱、“最近數星期以來、美國人民見解、已大為轉變、匪特不以孤立求自保、且已開始聲言、世界秩序、必須美國協力維護、此中關係自極重要、但亦未可過於誇張、任何方面、若於此際立即主張制裁日本、則美國輿論界必為之驚惶、而回復孤立政策、然則各國代表務當用盡調處方式、再行計議較為嚴峻之手段、此而失敗、則美國輿論界前此不願考盧之舉動、始可望其付諸實施也、”（中央社四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］關於九國公約會議事、急進社會黨事業報、頃加以評論云、“數年以來美國迄未參加國際會議、世人莫不為之大失所望、茲該國首席代表台維斯、出席九國公約會議、實乃該國過問國際事件之第一聲、但台維斯對於中日兩國、旣未加以區別、自係美國輿論尚未覺醒所致、羅斯福總統其欲顧及該國金融界巨頭之意見、先為中日爭端進行調處、必俟日本加以拒絕之後、乃可望美國輿論憬悟於局勢之嚴重歟、至法國外長台爾博斯日昨所發表之演說、最屬警闢、對於中日兩國旣明白加以區別、又復聲明法國願遵守九國公約、并會同各關係國出任調解、右派斐伽洛報載稱、”目下所亟須明瞭者、乃日本意願究係如何、然後商允中國共同討論解决方案、要之九國公約會議、若欲在調處之下、別有所作為、其結果定必利少害多、吾人倘能因勢利導、俾交戰雙方應允開始談判、始可為計之得者”云、（中央社四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美百貨公司抵制日貸</h3>

<p>［紐約］美國最大之渥爾華士百貸公司所屬分店二十五所、為響應抵制日貨運動起見、業已停出售日貨、（三日塔斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］倫敦郡議會供應部頃訓令所屬各機關、一律停止購買日貨、又據報載、英國各地工會及其他團體發表官言、要求英政府停止出售軍火與日本、並要求全世界對日經濟絕交者已達十三起之多、證明抵制日貨運動、業已開始發生實效云（三日塔斯）</p>

<p>［倫敦］共產黨議員加拉轍、今日在下院發言、主張增加對華醫藥品之接濟、日機轟炸不設防城邑、致中國平民傷亡甚衆、外部次官克蘭波代表政府答稱、英代表在國聯行政院委員會集議時、首先有此提議、以謀國聯與中國之合作、當時票决經費、二百萬瑞士法郎其中一百三十七萬法郎、由中國捐助作為中國對於國聯之供獻、否則此款將列入國聯經常預算案中矣、渠對於醫藥品之運出、不信其有過分延誤情事云、工黨議員威治伍間、何以此款專作防疫救濟用、充蘭波答稱以此款有限故也云、（中央社三日路透電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］此間“中國之友”協會頃舉行集會、討論中日兩國糾紛、法國總工會秘書長石屋當即發表演說、籲請全世界和平主義者援助中國、法國名記者魏沃利夫人（一二八時曾在上海任日報特派訪員）繼之發言、謂吾人亦可以私人名義援助中國、各國之捐助款項藥品者、已大有人在、所望法國同胞、勿落他人之後云、（中央社四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>穿過火線</h3>
<p>— 斐丹</p>
<p>為了避免飛機的襲擊，本來是應該於晚上出發的；可是因為數天的大雨，聽說把公路都沖壞了，使行非常危險，所以不得不提前於下午三時出發</p>
<p>租界內的情調，和華界的景况，是大不相同的。在租界內，雖然也有沙包壘和鐵絲網等防禦工事，并且也有很多乘汽軍，坐脚踏車及步行的巡邏隊，晝夜無休的四出巡視；但是在租界內行走的人，個個的心中，都是很閒散的，在戰時，閒散一字，或者是形容得不妥當，至少可說是不緊張的。在商業上，繁榮當然是說不上，但在霞飛路一帶，𤍠鬧决不減於戰時發生之前，華界的景象，就完全不同。店鋪差不多都關門了，雖有機個小攤頭，也掩飾不了他的冷落。可是我們看了沿途的防禦工事，勇敢雄壯的軍士，和莊重沉着的巡邏隊，說我們感到使不出的欣慰。</p>
<p>近年來的公路建設，雖然發展得極快，但是在建築工程上，我們總覺得欠堅固。江蘇的公路，素稱優良，但是經過此次戰爭的試練，我們就發覺了他不足之點甚多。淞滬蘇嘉一帶，在國防上是極重要的地區，所以路面的堅度和闊度，都應該注意到軍事運輸的便利。可是此次我們的車子，自□□□的柏油路轉灣之後，就是一段極泥濘的路，對面有一輛汽車，車輪陷在泥漿裏，無論如何也走不動，後來等到由另一輛車把他曳出之後，我們的車才能過去，而且兩條軍輪行跡，深深的陷下，差不多有一尺深，車行極惑困難。像這種泥濘的路，雖然並不很多，可是有二三段也就夠受了。經過三四天的大雨平坦的路面已經不多，一路車子震動極烈，跳動得利害的時候，我們的身子也跳起來，我們的頭殻、會撞到車頂。重要的公路幹綫，依理想，他的闊度，應該可以並行四輛車，可是現在有幾段，也可說是大部分，是一來一往兩輛車子也很不容易行走。這是我認為今後在公路建設上應該注意的一點，有許多重要的公路，現在就應該設法來補救的。</p>
<p>這條路在幾天前，雖然曾走過，因為時在深夜，除在遠處可以看見砲火的閃光之外，砲聲是被汽車馬達的聲音所壓，一點也聽不見，一路也未曾遇到飛機，旅途非常平凡。可是這次在出發之初，情形就比較緊張，因為我們出發，是在四點多鐘，正是敵人飛機活躍的時候，所以我們在走進火綫不遠的地方，就在遠處看見敵機在盤旋。我們的司機，是出入火綫多次了，所以這時是看到敵機並不驚慌，因為敵機並不向我們飛來，汽車依然向前疾馳。汽車一方面加足馬力，向前疾馳，一方面由□□□的勤務兵，注意着敵機的飛行方向。這時是雨後初睛，黑白相間的雲塊，好像列車一樣的在行走，敵機有時飛入雲塊，有時現於雲隙，在天空時隱時露的飛翔•汽車走近□□鎭，這裏有很多的兵士，在路上來往走動，忽然敵機飛出雲塊，出現於大家的眼前，并且跟着是機關槍聲，勤務兵就呌司機停車。司機因為飛機並不向我們對面飛來，而是在我們的前面橫飛而過，仍不停車，這時勤務兵異常驚慌，用力打着車壁，要司機停車，於是車子停了，全體都逃下車去。這地方剛是一個十字路口，旁邊有幾座房子，已經吃過幾個炸彈，大家因為隣近沒有障蔽物，都逃進這附近破爛的房子暫躲。一雲飛機過去，大家又重上汽車，繼續向前進行因為勤務兵過分驚慌，大家怪了他一陣。我們正在談論着的時，突然聽到一聲砲聲，異常接近，大家都吃了一驚，呆了一下，正想開始來談論砲聲來源的時候，又砰砰……一連迎面來了五六砲同時自遠處微微的可以聽對機關槍聲，這時司機就更加加速馬力，拚命向前開去。一霎兒我們就衝過了火綫，到了火綫的稍後方了。原來我們的軍隊，已經開始攻擊，與敵實行夜戰了，剛才的砲，是經過我們的車頂，射到敵人陣地去的。當時大家吃驚的，是不明這砲究竟是什麼地方來的緣故。</p>
<p>在這個地方，我們離敵軍陣地並不很遠。在幾里路外，我們看見有一個大布袋樣的東西，毫不動彈的高掛在空中，旣不像飛機，也不像氣球，旣不方，也不圓，這就是敵人的空中偵察台。此種偵察台，就是由氣球做的，不過形式特別一點罷！總說敵人空中偵察台已經用過數次，都被我們破壞掉！</p>
<p>在××附近，有一村落起火，一片融融的火光，看去極為凄慘。</p>
<p>經過了××之後，路上就很平安了，因為敵人砲火的威力，已不能及到此地，而這時已經過了六點鐘，天已昏黑，敵機也已停止活動！</p>
<p>在戰地中，我們常時遇到想中途上車的兵士，和傷兵。有許多兵是想附在車旁，隨車走一段後，到另一目的地去，有的傷兵是想我們把他帶到後方去。有一次有二個兵士，看見我們車子開上去，就站在路中央把我們的車子攔住，要跨上兩旁踏脚板，兩手抱住車窗，前往××鎭。司機在他們立脚未穩的時候，又很快的把車開動，有一兵十跌下去了；於是我們的車子不得不停下，這兵士又很快的跳上來，司機就舉起拳頭打了他兩下，并且怒罵了數聲。我很感覺到這個司機有點過分了。可是沿途要想中途附上車來的人，實在太多了，如果把他們都帶上來，不但是不可能的事，而且有時是會妨碍軍事行動的。</p>
<p>車子漸漸的馳近目的地了。這個地方自滬戰爆發，敵機數來投彈，電燈廠早已被炸；一般居民，也大部分移到鄕下去了。所以一到夜間，整個城市，就好像是一座沒有人跡的死城。</p>

<h3>漳河綫的防禦戰</h3>
<p>— 從周</p>
<p>平漢局勢的好轉</p>
<p>中央社戰地特派員通訊、平漢綫戰局、大約可分爲三個階段、從平津撤防到保定淪陷、是第一階段、從保定淪陷到石家莊不守、是第二個階段、石家莊失守以後、可說是進入第三個階段了、</p>
<p>平漢綫戰事、自進入第三個階段後、敵人的兵力始終爲兩師團、旅、而戰綫延長到千餘里、記者在北戰塲的新形勢二文　曾經指出我們的戰略、是消耗戰、越把戰爭拖延下去越會對我們有利、在整個的北戰塲上、敵人還沒有遇到我們的主力、我們軍略上的後退、僅僅表現在鐵道沿綫上平津四郊及沿太行山脈、我們還有無數的戰士活動着、隨時都有抄襲敵人後防、切斷敵人聯絡的可能、同時敵人佔領的區域越廣、則其實力的消耗和分散越大、在河北大平原上、正可展開我們遊擊戰和陣地戰　配合、然而兇頑的敵人、竟不顧這些戰略的困難、大胆地作着軍事上的冒險、漳河綫的防禦戰、終於受到我們英勇的戰士的打擊了、</p>
<p>漳河發源於山西、有淸濁兩流、淸流出於沾嶺、濁流出於發鳩山、這淸濁二流在安陽兩北六十五里的六河溝會合、橫過了鐵道綫東流、經河北省而入於衛河、安陽是舊彰德府治、介燕晋間、當平漢綫人豫之衝、是河南的北部門戶、而漳河恰好流經安陽城北、我們要保衛河南、便不得不保衛安陽、要保衛安陽、首先要保衛漳河之綫、我們的戰略、是步步爲營、穩紮穩打每個山頭、都是我們内要塞、每個叢林、都是我們的濠溝、每條河流、都是我們的天然屏障、漳河綫上、敵人要遭遇我們的嚴重打擊、已經是預料中的事、</p>
<p>不錯保定淪陷而後、我們繼續地喪失了許多重要的戰略地帶、然而敵人剎那間的局部勝利、是拿着幾萬條生命的代價換取的、我們英勇的戰士、確實做到了“勝不驕敗不餒”的精神、一月十八日的晚間、磁縣發現了敵人的先頭部隊、那是十六輛坦克車、五百左右的騎兵、在我們經營了半年以上的國防工事上展開了血戰、接着敵人的大部主力開到、有一旅團之衆、我們的部隊、一部分還在漳河南岸、一部分是從正定後撤下來的、戰鬥力較弱的部隊、那時磁縣已經在敵人的重重包圍中、我們的指揮官某氏、雖然處在這樣危急的環境中仍然十分鎭靜地策劃着軍事一面檄令漳河南岸的生力軍、迅速渡河、擔任正面防守、另一面嚴令退下的隊伍、從速整理、扼守鐵道綫的左右兩翼、經過了一夜的血戰、敵人終於越過了磁縣、沿着鐵路綫南進、我們爲了粉碎敵人‘中央突破’的戰略、始終扼守着鐵道的正面、某軍軍長乘着一列專車、雖然敵的砲彈不斷地落在附近、但是我們的指揮官、仍然鎭靜如常地指揮着部隊抵抗、十九日的淸晨、敵人已經到達漳河的北岸安陽車站、不斷地聽到砲聲隆隆、漳河橋爲了阻止沿鐵路綫進攻的敵人南下早已炸燬了、於是在漳河的北岸、重新展開了猛烈的陣地戰、這時敵人的戰略是第一向漳河綫我軍的陣地、以密集砲火猛攻、第二用一部分騎兵繞襲安陽西北平六十五里的六河溝、第三是發動彰德城內的漢奸暴動、廿日起、敵人用密集砲火的掩護、由漳河北岸涉水偷渡、以守××聞名的某軍長、親在火綫指揮、使敵軍受到巨大的損失、六河溝附近、在十六日以前、我們的某軍部隊、早已佈防竣事、所以繞襲的敵軍陷在重圍中、彰德漢奸暴動、也在我軍嚴密的監視下、沒有大規模地發動起來、二十一日、捕獲了二百多人、可以說這種漢奸工作、完全失敗了、敵人的第一個計劃、旣已粉碎無餘、同時我軍的左翼、也進展到磁縣、主力軍到達漳河以北的馬頭鎭、二十二日起、我們銀色雙翼的飛機、開始翱翔於漳河北岸的車站、炸燬了敵人的軍需品軍事工程和鐵甲車兩列、敵人的右翼逐漸地不能支持、一列列的坦克車蹣跚地向着東北方面的津浦綫撤退、廿三日、敵人從津浦綫上開來大批援軍、聯合潰敗的敵軍、以飛機大砲水陸、兩用坦克車、再向我河南的陣地猛犯、是日晚、有敵一聯隊約二千餘人、企圖偷渡漳河、又發生了激烈的戰鬥、我們英勇的戰士、作了壯烈的犧牲、有兩個團長陣亡、一個團長重傷、校尉中級軍官傷亡八十餘員、士兵死傷千餘名、然而我們的血肉、終於做了我們的長城、偷渡漳河的敵軍不得不抱頭鼠竄而退、二十四日、敵人再攻六河溝、沿六河溝之平漢支綫、猛犯豐樂鎭、企圖由背面威脅安陽、但是豐樂鎭的敵軍、馬上受到我軍的包圍、五百個俘虜、已經當做我們防禦漳河的禮品、押運南下了、二十五日、寶蓮寺雖然發現了敵軍、但那顯然是敵人的迴光返照、經過我生力軍的反攻、漳河南岸的敵軍、已經完全敗退、二十六日、我軍進展到邯鄲、二十七日、推進到順德、</p>
<p>漳河綫防禦戰的勝利、奠定了平漢綫局面的新展開、然而這次漳河綫防禦戰的勝利、一面固然在我們將士的用命、兵士的勇敢犧牲、但是還有其他的因素存在着、</p>
<p>第一、西戰塲上遭遇到我軍英勇的抵抗、日本發言人也不得不承認一日軍深受山地作戰之苦、如果西戰塲上失利、敵人將更難挽回北戰塲上的頹勢、</p>
<p>第二、我軍某部收復平型關紫荊關、而後克淶源、圍蔚縣、分頭襲擊易縣望都等地、保定已經處在危險綫上、平漢路敵軍的聯絡、隨時都可切斷、</p>
<p>第三、北滿情勢緊張、義勇軍沾躍、外蒙內向運動、平津近郊游擊戰開展、連日關東軍調出關外者、已達十六列車之多、敵軍在事實上、不得不謀縮短防綫、便於進退、</p>
<p>然而我們應該確認、目前敵軍戰略的變更、是要用全部的力量、奪取西戰塲上的勝利條件、因而娘子關附近、將要再度展開激烈的攻守戰、</p>
<p>突破敵人的一環、即是突破敵人的全環、保障漳河綫的防禦戰勝利的條件、便只有繼續地前進、當我們的部隊到達了正定時、便可以迅速地展開了陣地戰、和游擊戰的配合、盡可能地運用運動戰的技巧、防禦娘子關的鬥爭、也就是保障西戰塲上勝利的重要條件、</p>
<p>最後、我們在漳河綫防禦戰中發現了若干部隊組織的不健全、缺之精神敎育、沒有注意到士兵生活的改善、這種不良的現𧰼、我們希望能以自我批判的精神、在抗戰中逐漸地改正過來、使每個士兵都成爲堅强的戰鬥員、</p>
<p>還有在北戰塲上、除開南京婦女慰勞會代表一度北上外、幾乎沒有慰勞再來、忠勇衛國的將士們自然不會計較到這些、但是我們認爲慰勞隊戰地服務團這些組織、確實能夠鼓勵士氣、記者誠懇地利用這個機會、請求全國後援團體迅速地動員物力人力、大批地到北戰塲上來、（十月二十八日發）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>比京會議與國際形勢</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>遠東的和平並不依靠於九國公約的抽𧰼的條文。郤依靠於各和平國家的澈底的覺悟。這是我們對於比京會議應有的認識。</p>
<p>根據着這一點認識。我們以爲比京會議中所表現的國際形勢。已有幾分是可以樂觀的。</p>
<p>第一。在這個會議處着領導地位的英美兩國。表示了密切的合作。英外相艾登鄭重聲明着。願竭力擔負公約所規定的道德的義務。卽使日本不參加。亦不因而懈怠。我們素知盎格魯薩克遜民族。就是富於義俠的精神的。希望那兩大國負起了道德的義務以後。更能夠見義勇爲。</p>
<p>第二。蘇聯和法國在會塲上的表示比英美更有積極性。法外長台爾博斯說‘我們對於遠東的屠殺行爲。倘不設法加以制止。那麼我們簡直就是從犯了。’蘇聯外長李維諾夫則主張着會議應當提出各項建議。俾得恢復和平局勢並懲處侵略國。以儆效尤。這等表示顯然都爲的是要推動集體安全的局勢。</p>
<p>第三。我國代表顧維鈞大使在大會演說。‘日本侵略行動若一日不止。中國卽當賡續抗戰一日。惟以九國公約第一條爲根據的和平。中國始能加以接受。’這種嚴正的表示。足以打破袒護侵略國者的種種幻想。</p>
<p>第四。日本堅决拒絕參加會議。並將與意國簽訂防共恊定。這種倔强的態度。足使各和平國家愈益寒心。容易覺悟到集體安全的必要。</p>
<p>總之。比京會議本身的任務。雖不會比調解或是道德的制裁更進一步。但是作爲國際形勢發展中的過渡形態來看。未必是失望的據比京傳來的消息。會議如告失敗。則移交國聯處理。我們似乎不能無夜長夢多之感。其實國聯形勢的推移。處處跟我國對於抗戰的努力程度有關。只要我們的努力不鬆懈。國際的有利形勢總是步步展開的。</p>

<h3>家庭敎師之使命</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>自八一三滬戰爆發後、所有戰區及其鄰近各校、大都陷入停頓狀熊、靑年學子、雖有向學熱忱、而苦無求學之門、從事於敎育界者、徒抱服務宏願、而患無施敎之所、中國特種敎育恊會、有鑒及此、為試驗非常時期之特種敎育、及適應社會需求計、爰有家庭敎師、服務處之組織、以求完成一項特種任務、溯自開辦以來、為時一月有餘、敎師登記者凡七百人、聘請敎師者六十餘家、授課地點四十一處、服務敎師五十一人、學生凡一百三十六人、目前工作成績、雖未能達到吾人理想中之完美境界、但已足够助長吾人繼績試驗之勇氣、目前此項工作、尚未能充分發展、實由於社會一般人士、對此尚缺少相當認識、然此不足為慮、祗須一經試驗成功、自能受到社會熱烈之信任、而前途亦定能收得美滿之效果、</p>
<p>家庭敎師服務處、為非常時期試騐新敎育之重要機構、其敎師所負使命之重大、蓋可想見、對於下列所述之三大使命、更宜以深刻的認識、與切實的執行、</p>
<p>㊀試驗侗性敎育　吾國自施行新敎育以來、一般形式主義者、徒講表面、專重形式、祇求校舍高大、設備精美、此固可辦到形式上之美觀、然實未必能達到敎育上之整個使命、蓋敎育之眞僓值、實繫於精神訓練、而學生之個性•品行•道德•各有其擅長與缺點、如何矯正其缺點而發揮其優良、實為精神訓練最重要之任務、彼形式主義者、無暇及此、在班級制度敎育之下、僅注意於共同性、而絕少能兼顧個性、以敎帥一人、欲識數十數百學生之個性、似非易易、而學生之造詣、學生之好惡、以個性之差異、又各各不同、敎師於匆促授課之間、率未能悉心體會及此、昧於學生之個性、而徒施一般的敎育、此為現行敎育所不可避免之缺憾、在此非常時期、學校遭殃、由是過去班級敎授之缺憾、或轉可由他途以設法解决之、蓋家庭敎師制度、非單純為解决敎師失業、興夫避免學生困難而產生、其眞實效用、乃在試驗個別本位敎育、充實個別本位智能、矯正個別本位缺陷、以補救班級敎育之缺點、其成敗關鍵、擊於敎師之能否負起此項使命、故敎學宜優良、個性需適應、此乃不可忘之圭臬、我國敎育大家孔子、其敎育主張、自有其立塲、故為萬世師表、論語中論‘仁’、不下百十次、其對答無相同者、此非‘仁’之定義、可以隨時變更、乃在適應發問學生之個性而作答也、由是學生卒受感化、改革其習性、進而為賢人君子、今日之學校敎育、往往偏重形式漸形成字典式之敎育、而個別敎育則為活的敎育、亦即敎師之敎育、而非復字典式之敎育矣、故家庭敎師服務處之敎師、應負起此項使命、自信此為敎育上重大試驗之開始、促其有新事實新理論之發現、具有試驗精神者、固當不計事之成敗也、</p>
<p>㊁推進民衆組織　家庭敎師服務處之設立、正在非常時期、故敎師在敎學之使命外、更有對於非常時期民族國家應負之使命、即負起組織民衆之責任、日來一部份與論、往往指摘目前之無組織、憶昔九一八時、國際間亦有傷我為無組織之國家者、我人曾力加申辯、按諸事實、中國非無組織、不過民衆組織、或有不甚健全之處耳、故敎師應負起推進民衆組織、及健全民衆組織之使命、家庭敎師、其自身固有家庭、而其所服務者、又為學生之家庭、則敎學之餘、情感旣洽、自可使家與家之間、由無組織進而為有組織、更使已有組織者、更進而有健全之組織、此乃敎師在非常時期應盡之義務、凡具有熱心與毅力者、必可完成此項使命、以鼓人民、各盡其對於國家民族之責任也、</p>
<p>㊂以身作則感化羣衆　敎師本身、如未盡善、則不足以敎、更無以言導、學者效也、敎者範也、敎師不能以身作則、則學者無從倣效、難以取為模範、至於敎師應有優美之動作、以為楷模、猶如樂隊有良好之領隊、然後可以指揮徐疾緩急、以導之於抑揚頓挫、故領導者須先有動作、而學者方可有所遵循、敎師有如工廠之發動機、齒輪之旋轉、全賴發動機、故敎師之行為、如不能作為模范、則學生失其表式、羣衆亦無景仰、故敎師對於國家民族、應努力盡職則登高一呼、如響斯應、國家民族之前途、實利賴之、敎師欲領導學生、必先從自身做起、守規約、遵時間、確立信用、此為必備之條件、事雖平凡而瑣屑、然亦為確立聲譽之要着、須知凡事物之極平凡者、祇須空間與時間配合適當、亦即為最名貴者、古人謂‘行遠必自邇、登高必自卑’、意即一切均須從自已做起、從小處做起、願吾人永永把握此正確之觀點、</p>
<p>國慶日因出發慰勞傷兵、不克參與本處第一次家長敎師聯歡會為憾、今日得與諸君晤面、兼作如上之報告、不勝欣慰、在此欲附帶申明者、凡本處敎師所敎之學生、學期終時、經過會考及格者、得出社會局承認其學籍、下學期特許轉學、深望本處同人、暨各敎師加緊工作、共同努力、</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>主和者就是漢奸</h3>
<p>— 周憲文</p>
<p>近日在各種救亡的刊物上，我們可以看到大字的標題，謂，“主和者就是漢奸”；又在一二特區的馬路上，我們可以發現紅色的標語，謂：“主和者就是漢奸”。由於這些標題標語的傳播，乃使－般市民知道，抗戰到了今日，仍有一部份人在人在“主和”；這在一般市民想來，不能不算是一個驚奇的消息。其實呢？這次不是“空穴來風”，更無所用其驚奇；第一：自從日本軍隊進駐閘北以後，他們雖依然着着進攻，但同時多方面放出和平的空氣，傳聞居然還有人出而“奔走”；第二：比京的九國公約會議正在開會，各國代表口口聲聲要調解中日戰爭，恢復遠東和平；當然也有一部份中國人眼見國軍在南北戰塲的步後退，敵機在全國各地的濫施轟炸，深恐犧牲過大，有意“及時收篷•”有了這三種原因，就形成了近日的和平空氣，更就產生“主和者就是漢奸”的標題或標語•</p>
<p>當然，我們如果文嚼字地解釋，則這“主和者就是漢奸”的標題或標語，就不免有點語病•這不單因爲十中國是一個弱國，急切需要和平；中國就是一個强國，也是酷愛和平，不欲與外國輕啟戰端；所以現在的中日戰爭，無論從那一方面看來，都是人類社會的大不幸，而非中國人民所願爲；戰爭茍能停止，和平若可實現，寗非快事？故謂“主和者就是漢奸”，似爲苛評。便是，我們必須知道：這次的抗戰，我們是出於萬不得已；我們對於敵人的侵略，逆來順受者，已不知若十次；九一八事變時，我們應該抗戰；一二八事變時，我們應該抗戰；察北淪亡時，我們應該抗戰，冀東組府時我們應該抗戰：結果我們都忍受下來，可是我們愈忍受，敵人愈急進；我們忍無可忍，乃始不惜犧牲，起而抗戰；現在果能不戰而和，應爲我們所樂聞，但必須復我主權，還我領土，否則，這不是主和，乃是主降。抗戰到了今天，居然有人出面主降，這還不是漢奸麼？此所以稱“主和者就是漢奸”者一。</p>
<p>再則，請就近日和平空氣的來源，加以分析。</p>
<p>第一：敵人所放的和平空氣，是否可靠？這是個問題。如果敵人是另有作用，是用以擾亂我們的軍心與人心，那我們防之猶恐不及，焉可貿然和唱？退一步說，敵人確欲罷手，但其罷手的範團，是包括南北戰塲，抑或專指滬地而言，也成問題。誰都知道：這次中日戰爭的惠心，不在上海而在華北，要是敵人在上海方面適可而止，在華北方面依然進攻；這也祇是敵人的“如意算盤”，違反我們“全面抗戰”的精神；這樣的和平，我們豈可上當？再退一步說，即使敵人確欲全部休戰，但是休戰的條件究屬如何？仍是問題•目前，敵人在軍事上尚未吃到大虧，謂其休戰條件不比蘆溝橋事變時所提者來得苛刻，這可說是毫無常識的幻想。蘆溝橋事變旣然是我國决心抗戰的最後關頭，我國既然因欲保衛這最後關頭而犧牲了無數國民的生命與財產，現在我們在這抗戰的中途，豈能接受超過這最後關頭的條件？所以，目前敵人縱欲和平，這在事實上爲不可能，何况敵人未必眞心求和。</p>
<p>第二：比京九國公約會議雖然申言調解中日戰爭，但除調解以外，是參加會議的國家是否尚有制裁的考慮，這又是一個問題。我們知道：國公約對於侵略國並無任何制裁的規定，所以九國公約會議祇能主張調解，不便提出制裁，惟其如此，我們就不能不爲參加九國公約會議的國家，祇想調解了事，絕無對日制裁的考慮。其實呢？世界各國即使確有制裁日本的决心，這在手續上，也得經過一番調解我們如果以爲加九國公約會議的國家，他們目前申言調解，今後的行動亦止於調解，因而引起主和的動機，那是絕大的錯誤•何况抗戰是我們自己的事情。我們固然希望外國的幫忙，但是我們不能因爲外國要我們和，我們就和•更何况九國公約會議的申言調解，尚不足以證明各國對於日本並無進而制裁的决心。</p>
<p>第三：至於國民的生命財產因爲抗戰而大受損失，那原是意料以內的現象；以弱國的中國以常强國的日本，初期軍事的小挫，那尤為必然的事實。否則，我們早就不必號召長期抗戰，我們正可與日本拼個“速戰速决”。即就滬戰而論，我們能在閘北江灣戰守兩月餘，而後安全退却，這與其說是軍事的失敗，毋寗說是軍事的勝利。從今以後，我們且可公然承認，南市也有撤退的一日，甚而𦤳於首都或有失守的一天；凡此一切，都是我們在開始抗戰時所應認識且已認識的過程：我們如果沒有這樣的認識，老實說，我們早就應該對敵人“屈膝”，做敵人的奴隸，不應該發動這一次的抗戰，我們發動這次的抗戰。是欲以持久的犧牲获取最後的勝利。而且勝利是有充分的把握。故在今日，如果有人因怕目前的犧牲，因而主張“及時收篷”，那眞完全沒有理解中國對日抗戰的意義。</p>
<p>綜上三點，可知近日和平空氣的來源絕無充分的理由，我們固然深信政府勢必澈底抗戰，决不因外間的和平空氣而有絲亳的動搖，但若有人根據這些絕無充分理由的來源而竟貿然主和，那就不得不認其有擾亂軍心與人心的惡果。正在前綫將士浴血抗戰，後方民眾努力應援的時候，居然有人出而擾亂軍心與民心，這還不是漢奸麼？此所以稱“主和者就是漢奸”者二。</p>
<p>“主和者就是漢奸，”這話固然是有語病，而且似爲酷評，但事實上在目前的環境之下主和，這不是主降的别名，就有擾亂軍心與民心的危險，至少是於無意之中𧗊了漢奸的作用。抗戰發生以後的中國人民，誰都應該深深記得•我們祇有一條出路！抗戰到底！博取最後的勝利。</p>

<p>南市之水電方面因全滬自來水總管在滬南半淞園路外灘、是以租界當局、為保護起見、在求新廠前面泊有小型兵艦一艘、自敵揚言轟炸後、法軍事當局已派兵五百餘名、在半淞園路浦邊保護、是以自來水廠可以亳無妨害、電氣公司因接連之故、亦屬無虞、惟南市沿馬路之路燈、電氣公司已完全拆除、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>語曰。得之意外。失之意中。天下事皆作如是觀。凡事愈欲求其成而愈不可成。不欲求其成或竟忽然而成。此其理誠足思也。我觀九國公約會議情形。而深為可慮。所慮為何。卽各國對於此次會議希望和平之念太切。因此和平之效果。反不易收獲。若各國能稍减其和平的企求。而作不和平之準備。則和平或易可得。然而此事未易言也。</p>

<h3>抗戰和服務</h3>
<p>— 林劍星</p>
<p>自從我們的領袖蔣委員長發表了三次談話以後，巳確定了抗戰的立場，“全面抗戰”遂成為我們不可動搖的國策。</p>
<p>八月十三日全面抗戰在上海揭開了序幕，敵人以二十餘萬的大軍，陸海空猛烈的砲火，向我們進攻，但我們還是屢次予敵人以重大的創傷，使其困處淞滬一隅，未能進展，最近雖以戰略關係，撤退至第二道防綫，但大上海究竟還在我們的手中，而敵人所得的僅是閘北的一片斷垣殘瓦，得不償失，是無可諱言的，何况他們還不可久據呢！</p>
<p>華北方面，我們雖失去了許多領土，但我們的抗戰，從未因之稍懈，我們也不承認這是我們的失敗。山西方面敵軍已將進逼太原，這幾天似很危急，但我們軍事當局已調大軍前去增援反攻，當可無慮。據說敵人等得了山西後，軍事將暫行停止，而先要把華北五省自治的傀儡戲登起塲來。</p>
<p>然而事實却没有那麽容易，傀儡儘管登場，而我抗戰還是不停，我們不能讓敵人在我們的領土上橫行，我們要繼續運用我們的國策，以爭取最後的勝利，貫澈旣定的方針。</p>
<p>敵人的凶暴，我們不怕，敵人的砲火，我們更不怕，政府旣宣示了抗戰的方針給我們，我們只有確立了為抗戰而奮鬥的决心，我們有的是力，匯集了每個在後方靑年的力，作抗戰的後盾，我相信勝算可操左券的。</p>
<p>在從前抗戰沒有發動，敵人壓迫得我們連“日本”兩個字都不許出口而要用“××來代替的時候，我們每個人—尤其是一般靑年們，恨不得立刻去把敵人殺死把三島踏平，現在抗戰旣經發動，正是全國民衆吐氣的時候，也是効力黨國的時候，我們當怎樣利用時機，發洩我們四十年來鬱結不平之氣呢？現在我們要用出全副的力，緊緊地抓住敵人，向他致命傷的地方打去，不要輕易的放過了他。</p>
<p>我們有的是力，我們當以力服務國家，服務社會；抗戰不止，服務不止；抗戰到底，服務到底。</p>

<h3>I Declare to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference that Peace Must Be Based on Treaties</h3>
<p>Otherwise, it would tarnish world civilization. I am determined to resist to the end. Litvinov advocated practical measures to punish aggression.</p>
<p>Brussels. At the Nine-Power Treaty Conference yesterday afternoon, Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, delivered a speech on the spot. His wording was moderate, and the main points of the British, American, and French countries in seeking a peaceful solution to the Sino-Japanese war at this conference were completely harmonious. Gu stated, "China prays for peace, but while Japanese aggression continues, China is determined to resist to the end. Peace at any price will not only fail to achieve justice for China but will also be of no benefit to civilization. Peace must be based on Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty. We deeply know that you all believe in the sacred principle of treaties, and we dare to contribute with the full cooperation of the Chinese government."</p>
<p>The Soviet representative Litvinov then gave a speech, and the conference adjourned at 6:15 p.m. It was decided that the committees would hold separate closed-door meetings at 2:30 p.m. today. According to the latest news, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is still planning to make a final effort to obtain any form of Japanese cooperation. However, everyone feels that Japan's intentions are unlikely to change. The Japanese side reiterated last night that it had received prior instructions to reject any new requests to participate in the conference. However, the representatives of the countries concerned are unwilling to abandon any possible avenue in the early stages of the conference and still intend to make one last attempt. No decision has been made on future actions, but it is widely rumored in the conference lounge that the countries intend to nominate the United Kingdom and the United States to serve as mediators. It is highly uncertain whether the United Kingdom and the United States are willing to take on this thankless responsibility and whether Japan will accept the terms when they are presented.</p>
<p>In his speech yesterday, Gu Weijun also mentioned the fact of Japan's military aggression, which was thoroughly examined by representatives of twenty-three countries. Subsequently, it was unanimously passed by fifty-one countries, confirming that Japanese troops had invaded Chinese territory and occupied vast areas, including Beiping. The Japanese government has also dispatched the navy to blockade the Chinese coast, and with the pressure of a large army, it has harmed innocent Chinese civilians in the land, sea, and air. The Chinese territory occupied by the Japanese military includes the entire provinces of Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan, and parts of the provinces of Shanxi and Shandong, with an area almost the size of the United Kingdom and Germany combined. The occurrence of the current war is a continuation of Japan's policy of aggression since the September 18th Incident in 1931 when it occupied the three northeastern provinces. There is no doubt about this. Gu also stated, "What China regrets is that the military buildup in recent years has not been more rapid and extensive, so that it could have resisted the aggression more effectively and reduced the number of civilians who were brutally killed." Gu continued, "Japan has repeatedly said that Westerners find it difficult to understand the situation in the Far East. In fact, the only thing difficult to understand is Japan's unilateral aggression, which not only goes back on its word but also contradicts its own interests. Japan often accuses China of lacking a strong government, but within its own government, the peaceful intentions declared by civilians today are proven false by the actions of its military tomorrow, so it is also of no benefit to Japan." Gu also mentioned the large-scale smuggling movement in North China, saying that its purpose was to inflict economic blows on the Chinese government, create division in China, and increase Japan's control in the area. Regarding Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Gu believes that this further proves Japan's disregard for treaty obligations. If Japan has reason to speak of and has a clear conscience, it does not need to fear that its theories will not be understood. Gu did not deny the existence of anti-Japanese sentiment in China and stated that anti-Japanese sentiment is a natural result of Japanese aggression. As for the Japanese claim that the Chinese government is manipulated by communists, it can be dismissed with a smile. In his speech, Litvinov warned the countries that international conferences are sometimes used by aggressors, especially when the conference is prolonged indefinitely. What the countries are most concerned about may only be maintaining their own existence, obtaining moral satisfaction for the initiators of the conference, or only seeking superficial success, which is unrelated to the success of the cause. He believes that this conference must advance towards its goal of restoring peace in the Far East and establishing a just peace. If so, the hands of the aggressors will not be allowed to run wild but will be further restrained. All of this is said not only for today but also for the future, not only for the Far East but also for other parts of the world. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 4th)</p>
<p>At the Nine-Power Treaty Conference yesterday afternoon, the first to deliver a speech was the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, who expressed his agreement with the views of the American representative, Davis. He also said that the Soviet Union's position on the issue of resisting aggressor countries is based on the idea of peace-loving. He has repeatedly explained this before. Other countries' views should also agree, but how can we avoid verbally condemning the aggressor countries and take practical measures to protect or restore peace? This is where the difficulty lies. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference today is convened to discuss the two issues of preventing aggression and restoring peace. This is extremely important in its spiritual significance. "Peace-loving countries should unite to deal with aggressor countries, and it is hoped that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will put forward various suggestions to restore peace and punish aggressor countries to deter others."</p>
<p>Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, then spoke, saying, "The Nine-Power Treaty Conference was convened because one of the contracting states, namely Japan, violated Article 1 of the treaty and used force to invade China, resulting in the current situation." Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty stipulates that in the event of any situation arising that involves the application of the provisions of the treaty, the contracting states shall fully and frankly inform each other. This is both the right and the responsibility of the contracting states. Japan's refusal to participate in the conference only serves to prove once again that the country disregards treaty obligations. " Gu also said that Japan's so-called willingness to cooperate with China is not true. "Anyone who wants to make friends with a neighbor would never slap them in the face, force them to kneel, and plot to kill them." Speaking of the relationship between China and other countries, he said that since the countries abandoned their past policies, all kinds of difficulties have been swept away. China can cooperate with the countries in a free, sincere, and friendly environment. China's economic situation continues to develop, and both sides benefit from it. "Only Japan sticks to old ideas and wants to use economic development as a pretext to carry out its policy of controlling China. If Japan does not abandon this cruel and untimely policy and replace it with the principles of equality and mutual benefit, there will be no true cooperation between China and Japan. Moreover, this cooperative undertaking is in line with the Open Door Policy and should not be limited to Japan but should be extended to all countries in the area. In the past few months, China has spared no great sacrifices, and its contribution to international law and order is not insignificant." At this point, Dr. Gu Weijun stated that China adheres to the principle of the sacred nature of the current treaty and that all countries attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference also wish to guarantee it. "The forces of aggression in the Far East are like a runaway horse. If they cannot be effectively controlled, and if faith in promises cannot be restored, I am afraid that the forces of aggression will cross the borders of China and incite a world war. At that time, no country will be able to stay out of it and not be drawn into the vortex. For the sake of the general peace and the safety of all countries, we hope that China will receive fair treatment and wish the conference success in its work. We will do our best to help. " In conclusion, he said that China must continue to fight bravely and that all kinds of obstacles are not what we want.</p>
<p>The representative of Portugal, Castro, spoke last, saying, "Portugal has significant interests in the Far East. Since the dispute between China and Japan occurred, Portugal has declared neutrality, but "if the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can decide on any action based on the objectives stated in the government's invitation and which is conducive to mediation, Portugal is prepared to support it."

<h3>Representatives of Various Countries Meet Outside the Conference to Discuss the Establishment of a Working Mechanism</h3>
<p>Two Committees Were Formed to Study the Situation and Discuss Solutions. The Italian Representative Invited Japan and Germany to Participate, But It Was Reportedly Rejected.</p>
<p>Brussels. British Foreign Secretary Eden, U.S. Chief Representative Davis, French Foreign Minister Delbos, and this substitute Foreign Minister Spaak held talks last night. No compromise has been reached on the main points. The talks will continue this morning. It is reported that a proposal to organize two committees will be put forward at the closed-door meeting this afternoon. One committee will examine the current situation in the Far East concerning the obligations of the Nine-Power Treaty, and the other will study possible steps to hold open negotiations and stop the war between China and Japan (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<p>Brussels. The representatives of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, including the Soviet Union but excluding China, are currently conducting informal research on inviting Japan to contact the conference in order to find out under what conditions Japan would be willing to cease fire. This issue only concerns Japan, so the Chinese representative did not attend. However, any proposal will be submitted to the plenary session for a decision. Soviet Chief Representative Litvinov visited French Foreign Minister Delbos this morning and will have lunch with U.S. Chief Representative Davis at noon (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 4th).</p>
<p>Brussels. Representatives of the eight countries of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, including the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Russia, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal, held a confidential meeting today. It is reported that they have decided to form a committee to request China and Japan to submit ceasefire conditions and will invite Germany to participate in this committee. The representatives of the eight countries discussed convening a second meeting when the ceasefire conditions between China and Japan are agreed upon to make a final solution to the Sino-Japanese issue. However, the Japanese diplomatic community here has indicated that it is unwilling to participate in such a meeting (National Telegram on the 4th).</p>
<p>Brussels. The representatives of the eight countries of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference have now agreed to issue another invitation to Germany, inviting it to attend the conference, and have appointed a small committee composed of three or four representatives to contact Japan (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 4th).</p>
<p>Brussels. Italian representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Arturo Mondini, met with the ambassadors of Germany, Japan, and Portugal in Belgium this morning to exchange views on the establishment of two committees by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. It is reported that the Italian representative invited Germany and Japan to participate, but was rejected. Therefore, Italy will refuse to participate in any committee without the participation of Germany and Japan (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<p>Brussels. Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, visited Italian Chief Representative Marco di this morning. In the evening, British, French, and American Chief Representatives Eden, Delbos, and Davis, and the chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Belgian Chief Representative Spaak, held a closed-door meeting to discuss the procedures for conference proposals and agreed to exchange views with Representative Gu this morning. The conference will continue in the afternoon of the 4th (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<p>Brussels. What the representatives of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference discussed outside the meeting today was mainly the proposal put forward by the United States to invite Japan again. However, they are all worried that Japan will still refuse. Therefore, it is advocated that only diplomatic talks should be conducted with the Japanese government so that even if the country does not send representatives to attend the conference, at least a more compromising statement can be made to explain under what conditions mediation can be accepted. Regarding this, the representatives of the countries will discuss it at the closed-door meeting at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow. As for entrusting certain countries to act as mediators, it will be postponed to another day. However, when the representatives of the countries were talking, they intended to entrust the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and Italy to act as mediators, following the precedent of the Shanghai War in 1932. If Italy refuses at that time, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States should still do it themselves. In addition, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference may temporarily suspend the plenary session tomorrow according to the US proposal and appoint a smaller committee, without including China in the committee, to contact the Japanese government, pending the results of the committee's negotiations with Japan. British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Delbos are scheduled to return to their countries on the 5th of this month (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 3rd).</p>
<p>Brussels. American sources here recently stated that when U.S. representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference Davis met with British Foreign Secretary Eden in the evening, he advocated issuing a second invitation to the Japanese government. Foreign Secretary Eden had already discussed this matter with French Foreign Minister Delbos during lunch. In the afternoon, Eden and Delbos met for an hour, and the discussion was also related to this matter. The US delegation believes that the reason why the Japanese government refuses to participate is because the conference was initiated by the League of Nations. In fact, this conference was convened in accordance with Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty and is completely independent. If Japan does not send representatives to attend the conference, it will inevitably be unable to do anything. Therefore, the US delegation advocated that a committee composed of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty (excluding China) should be formed, and the committee should issue a second invitation to Japan inviting it to participate (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 2nd).</p>
<h3>Japan's Aggression Against China Is Like Pushing a Rock Up a Mountain</h3>
<p>Temporary Progress Will Eventually Lead to Self-Destruction. British Newspapers Comment on the Conference Situation.</p>
<p>[London] A special correspondent for The Times in Beijing reported on the situation of yesterday's Nine-Power Treaty Conference, saying that Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, presented China's reasons with appropriate logic and a dignified tone that was neither arrogant nor humble. Those who heard him were all moved. The Manchester Guardian reported that the opening of the international conference had never been so harmonious as this one. The immediate result of this conference may be the willingness of both China and Japan to open peace talks, but the basis for starting peace talks is unlikely to be agreed upon by both sides. We must know that it is China that is resisting the aggressor, not the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. If Japan continues to aggress, when will China's resistance stop? Only China can say. As for breaking this deadlock in negotiations, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference should immediately report to the League of Nations General Assembly so that the League of Nations General Assembly can study other possible methods prescribed by the resolution. Victory will eventually belong to the weak. Even if Japan reaches the Yellow River in the north and occupies Shanghai in the south, it must continue to fight as it did at the beginning of the war. Pushing a rock up a mountain will eventually lead to self-destruction. Will Japan be defeated by its own victory? Therefore, the Nine-Power Conference may be able to use its influence or pressure to promote Japan's reflection (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 4th).</p>
<p>[London] The Daily Telegraph today published an article summarizing the value of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, saying, "Only the most robust optimist can believe that the so-called Nine-Power Treaty Conference can seize a large amount of success for its charitable purpose from the adverse environment that hinders the path to peace." The newspaper added that the speeches of the representatives of the countries yesterday may have a good effect, that is, to make Japanese public opinion understand that the conference not only has no preconceived ideas but also denies any intention to judge. Since the representatives of the countries at the conference have given this guarantee, Japan may be quite satisfied, but China's satisfaction will inevitably decrease accordingly (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 4th).</p>
<p>[London] The Nine-Power Treaty Conference has recently been commented on by various British newspapers. The Daily News reported, "After the League of Nations previously condemned Japan's acts of aggression, Japan used the pretext of hasty judgment and refused to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. To this day, it would be overly optimistic to say that this conference can achieve great success, but since we have signed a treaty, we should not evade the obligations specified in the treaty. Now that we have fulfilled this obligation, we can have a clear conscience whether the conference is successful or not." The News Chronicle reported, "In recent weeks, American public opinion has changed greatly. Not only does it not seek self-preservation through isolation, but it has also begun to declare that world order must be maintained with the cooperation of the United States. This relationship is extremely important, but it should not be overstated. If any party immediately advocates sanctions against Japan at this time, American public opinion will be alarmed and return to an isolationist policy. Therefore, the representatives of the countries must exhaust all mediation methods before considering more severe measures. If this fails, then the actions that American public opinion was previously unwilling to consider can be expected to be implemented" (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 4th).</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the Radical Socialist Party's L'Œuvre commented, "For many years, the United States has not participated in international conferences, which has greatly disappointed the world. Now, the country's chief representative Davis is attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, which is the country's first voice in international affairs. However, since Davis did not distinguish between China and Japan, it is because American public opinion has not yet awakened. Does President Roosevelt want to take into account the opinions of the financial giants in the country and first mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute, and only after Japan refuses can American public opinion be expected to realize the seriousness of the situation? As for the speech delivered by French Foreign Minister Delbos yesterday, it was the most incisive, clearly distinguishing between China and Japan and stating that France is willing to abide by the Nine-Power Treaty and will jointly mediate with the countries concerned. The right-wing Figaro reported, "What is urgently needed to be understood now is what Japan's intentions are, and then we should consult with China to discuss solutions. In short, if the Nine-Power Treaty Conference wants to do something other than mediation, the result will definitely be more harmful than beneficial. If we can guide the situation and allow the warring parties to agree to start negotiations, then we can be considered to have planned well" (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 4th).</p>
<h3>US Department Stores Boycott Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>British Boycott Movement Expands</p>
<p>[New York] Twenty-five branches of the largest American Wolworth department store have stopped selling Japanese goods in response to the boycott of Japanese goods (TASS dispatch on the 3rd).</p>
<p>[London] The Supply Department of the London County Council recently instructed all its agencies to stop purchasing Japanese goods. It is also reported that trade unions and other organizations in various parts of the United Kingdom have issued official statements demanding that the British government stop selling arms to Japan and demanding that the world impose an economic break with Japan, totaling as many as thirteen cases, proving that the boycott of Japanese goods movement has begun to have a real effect (TASS on the 3rd).</p>
<h3>League of Nations Medical Aid to China</h3>
<p>British Parliamentarians Advocate for Increased Support</p>
<p>[London] Communist parliamentarian Gallagher spoke in the House of Commons today, advocating for increased medical aid to China. Japanese aircraft bombed undefended cities, causing many casualties among Chinese civilians. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne replied on behalf of the government that the British representative first made this proposal when the League of Nations Administrative Council met to discuss cooperation between the League of Nations and China. At that time, it was decided by vote that the expenses would be 2 million Swiss francs, of which 1.37 million francs would be donated by China as China's contribution to the League of Nations; otherwise, this amount would be included in the League of Nations' regular budget. He did not believe that there was excessive delay in the shipment of medical supplies. Labour MP Wedgwood asked why this amount was used exclusively for epidemic prevention and relief. Cranborne replied that this was because the amount was limited (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 3rd).</p>
<p>[Paris] The "Friends of China" Association here recently held a gathering to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor, Stowe, immediately delivered a speech, calling on pacifists around the world to help China. Madame Wei Volili, a famous French journalist (who served as a special correspondent for a newspaper in Shanghai at 128 o'clock), then spoke, saying that we can also help China in a private capacity. Many people in various countries have donated money and medicine. It is hoped that French compatriots will not fall behind others (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 4th).</p>
<h3>Anti-British Movement by Tokyo Students</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Three hundred students in Tokyo lined up to the British Embassy after holding a memorial service for the anniversary of the birth of the Japanese Emperor Meiji, performing Indian war-style dances and nominating representatives to present a document to the Counselor of the British Embassy, expressing their anger at Britain's abandonment of Japan, saying that Britain had previously benefited greatly from Japan's sacrifices, and now Japan is waging a "holy war" with the goal of "establishing lasting peace in the Far East," but Britain is assisting the Nanjing government, which hinders the achievement of this goal. The students have a friendly feeling towards Britain and hope that the British government will consider its lack of foresight in its policies (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 4th).</p>
<h3>Yu Bin and Zhang Pengchun Arrive in Brussels One After Another</h3>
<p>Brussels. Bishop Yu Bin arrived here from Rome today. The Italian representative Arstrong Ludewig will meet him in the afternoon. Professor Zhang Pengchun of Nankai University arrived here last night (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<h3>US Increases Production of Aircraft Carriers</h3>
<p>Currently, There Are Four</p>
<p>[Washington] According to local authorities today, since the launch of the USS Yorktown aircraft carrier, the US naval aircraft strength has increased significantly. Approximately, in addition to the naval aircraft stationed at land airfields, at least 450 can be loaded on aircraft carriers, and 100 more can be added if necessary. According to the current four US aircraft carriers, each can carry at least four squadrons of 72 aircraft, and 20 more can be added if necessary. Combined, they can carry 368 aircraft, and the USS Enterprise will be completed within a few months. By then, the aircraft that US aircraft carriers can load will be at least 450. In addition, each US battleship can carry three aircraft, heavy cruisers can carry four aircraft, and light cruisers can carry two aircraft. According to the 1938 budget, the US Air Force's expenditure is 29,186,000 yuan, of which 19,386,000 yuan is used to replace old aircraft, and 7,874,000 yuan is used to purchase new aircraft. At the same time, the Navy also plans to use 3,500,000 yuan for research and testing to improve aircraft and another 1,000,000 yuan to build high-speed reconnaissance aircraft (National Telegram on the 3rd).</p>
<h3>Germany, Italy and Japan Conspire: Anti-Comintern Pact to Be Signed Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Germany Denies Containing Military Clauses; Exchange of Letters Between British and Italian Authorities</p>
<p>[Berlin] A rumor circulated that the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, scheduled to be signed in Rome on the 6th of this month, contains military clauses aimed at preventing Soviet intervention in the Far East. However, responsible parties here today denied this, stating that the pact does not contain any military clauses and its general principles are similar to the existing Japan-Germany agreement. German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, recently returned from Italy and is reportedly going to Rome again to sign the pact on behalf of Germany. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union is closely monitoring the matter. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, recently departed for Rome, preparing to sign the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan with representatives from Italy and Japan on Saturday of this week. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>[London] During the House of Commons session today, Prime Minister Chamberlain, despite being newly recovered from an illness, attended in person, greeted with prolonged applause from the members. Sir Harris, a Labor Party MP in the opposition, inquired about the exchange of letters between the Prime Minister and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The Prime Minister replied, "At the end of July this year, Italian Ambassador Grandi delivered a personal letter from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to me, stating that the mutual trust and cordial relations between Britain and Italy had deteriorated in recent years and had not yet been restored to their original state, which was a great pity. I immediately replied, stating that I firmly believed that all misunderstandings and suspicions could be cleared, and that it would not be difficult to restore the friendly relations between the two countries to their former state. I also informed him that the British government was ready to hold talks with Italy to achieve this goal. Prime Minister Mussolini subsequently sent another letter, stating that he was extremely willing to restore good relations between the two sides and expressed his approval of holding talks to promote friendly relations." Labor Party MPs, along with Welsh, questioned the Prime Minister, stating that the spirit of Prime Minister Mussolini's subsequently published articles in Italian newspapers was clearly different from what was stated in the letters, which was surprising. Labor MP Davison asked with a hint of sarcasm, "Is the Prime Minister satisfied with the positive impact of these letters on the friendly relations between Britain and Italy?" The Prime Minister replied, "Yes." The questions from the opposition party MPs were met with laughter. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Sharp Drop in US Trade with China and Japan</h3>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of Commerce Roper announced today that US trade with China and Japan fell sharply in September. Exports to China reached only US$559,000, compared to US$6,081,000 in August. Imports from China reached only US$572,000, compared to US$7,961,000 in August. Exports to Japan reached only US$16,842,000, compared to US$24,644,000 in August. Imports from Japan reached only US$15,988,000, compared to US$16,297,000 in August. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Through the Line of Fire</h3>
<p>— Fei Dan</p>
<p>To avoid air raids, we should have departed at night; however, due to several days of heavy rain, we heard that the roads were washed out, making travel very dangerous, so we had to depart early at 3 p.m.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the concession and the situation in the Chinese area were vastly different. In the concession, although there were sandbag emplacements and barbed wire, as well as many military police patrolling day and night on motorcycles, bicycles, and on foot, the people walking in the concession were relaxed. In wartime, the word "relaxed" may not be appropriate, but at least they were not tense. Commercially, prosperity was out of the question, but the bustling activity around Avenue Joffre [now Huaihai Road] was no less than before the war. The scene in the Chinese area was completely different. Almost all the shops were closed, and even the few small stalls could not conceal the desolation. However, when we saw the defensive fortifications along the way, the brave and majestic soldiers, and the solemn and composed patrols, we felt an indescribable sense of relief.</p>
<p>Although road construction has developed rapidly in recent years, we always feel that the construction is not solid enough. The roads in Jiangsu Province are known for their excellence, but after the test of this war, we discovered many shortcomings. The Songhu (Shanghai-Wusong) and Sujia (Suzhou-Jiading) areas are extremely important for national defense, so the solidity and width of the road surface should be considered for the convenience of military transport. However, after our car turned from the □□□ asphalt road, we encountered a very muddy stretch. A car was stuck in the mud, and no matter what it did, it couldn't move. Later, after another car pulled it out, our car was able to pass, and the tracks of the military tires sank deeply, almost a foot deep, making it extremely difficult to drive. Although there were not many such muddy roads, even two or three stretches were enough to suffer. After three or four days of heavy rain, there were not many flat road surfaces left. The car shook violently along the way, and when it bounced hard, our bodies jumped up, and our heads hit the roof. Ideally, the width of important trunk roads should be able to accommodate four cars abreast, but now some sections, or most of them, are difficult to navigate even with two cars going in opposite directions. This is what I think should be paid attention to in future road construction, and many important roads should be remedied now.</p>
<p>Although we had traveled this road a few days ago, it was at night, and apart from seeing the flashes of artillery fire in the distance, the sound of the artillery was drowned out by the sound of the car engine, and we did not encounter any planes along the way, so the journey was very ordinary. However, this time, the situation was more tense from the beginning, because we departed at around 4 p.m., which was when enemy planes were active, so not far after we entered the line of fire, we saw enemy planes circling in the distance. Our driver had been in and out of the line of fire many times, so he was not alarmed when he saw the enemy planes, because they were not flying towards us. The car continued to speed forward. The car sped forward at full speed, while the soldiers from □□□ watched the flight direction of the enemy planes. At this time, the rain had just cleared, and the black and white clouds were moving like trains. The enemy planes sometimes flew into the clouds and sometimes appeared in the gaps, flying intermittently in the sky. As the car approached □□ town, there were many soldiers walking back and forth on the road. Suddenly, an enemy plane flew out of the clouds and appeared before everyone's eyes, followed by the sound of machine guns. The soldiers told the driver to stop. The driver did not stop because the plane was not flying towards us but flying across in front of us. At this time, the soldiers were extremely panicked and hit the side of the car hard, telling the driver to stop. So the car stopped, and everyone ran out of the car. This place was just at a crossroads, with several houses nearby that had been hit by bombs. Everyone ran into the nearby dilapidated houses to hide temporarily because there were no shelters nearby. Once the plane had passed, everyone got back into the car and continued forward, blaming the soldiers for being too panicked. As we were talking, we suddenly heard a cannon sound, which was unusually close. Everyone was startled and stunned for a moment. Just as we were about to start talking about the source of the cannon sound, bang, bang... five or six cannons came one after another, and at the same time, we could faintly hear the sound of machine guns from a distance. At this time, the driver accelerated even more and drove forward desperately. In a moment, we had rushed through the line of fire and reached the rear of the line of fire. It turned out that our troops had already started attacking and were engaged in night combat with the enemy. The cannons had passed over the roof of our car and fired into the enemy's positions. Everyone was surprised at the time because they did not know where the cannons were coming from.</p>
<p>In this place, we were not very far from the enemy's positions. A few miles away, we saw a large bag-like object hanging motionless in the air, looking neither like a plane nor a balloon, neither square nor round. This was the enemy's aerial reconnaissance station. This type of reconnaissance station is made of balloons, but the shape is a bit special! In short, the enemy's aerial reconnaissance station had been used several times, and all had been destroyed by us!</p>
<p>Near ××, a village was on fire, and the flickering flames looked extremely desolate.</p>
<p>After passing through ××, the road was very peaceful, because the power of the enemy's artillery fire could no longer reach this place, and it was already past six o'clock, the sky was dark, and the enemy planes had stopped their activities!</p>
<p>In the war zone, we often encountered soldiers and wounded soldiers who wanted to get on the car midway. Many soldiers wanted to cling to the car and travel a short distance to another destination, and some wounded soldiers wanted us to take them to the rear. Once, two soldiers saw our car driving up and stood in the middle of the road to stop our car. They wanted to climb onto the side steps and hold onto the car windows to go to ×× town. The driver quickly started the car again before they were firmly on their feet, and one soldier fell off. So our car had to stop, and the soldier quickly jumped back on. The driver raised his fist and punched him twice, cursing him several times. I felt that the driver was a bit excessive. However, there were too many people along the way who wanted to hitch a ride midway. It was not only impossible to take them all, but it would sometimes hinder military operations.</p>
<p>The car was gradually approaching its destination. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, enemy planes had come to drop bombs several times, and the power plant had already been bombed. Most of the residents had also moved to the countryside. So at night, the entire city was like a deserted city with no one.</p>
<h3>US Plan Based on Principle of Economic Reciprocity</h3>
<p>US Undersecretary of State Issues Statement; US-British Trade Agreement Negotiations Underway</p>
<p>[Washington] Under Secretary of State Welles stated today that the United States firmly believes that its principles for improving the international economy, if emulated in the Far East and adopted throughout the world, would help solve current problems. The recent statement by US Special Envoy Davis that the Far East problem contains an economic component, and his declaration that the United States advocates using this economic component as a prerequisite for resolving the war, are based on the aforementioned belief. Other than this, the United States has no other concrete proposals. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>[London] According to sources here today, British Foreign Secretary Eden met with US Ambassador to Britain Bingham before leaving the country for Belgium. The content of the talks was related to US President Roosevelt's willingness to continue trade agreement talks with Britain to strengthen relations between the two countries. It is said that Eden will also discuss this issue with US representative Davis after going to Belgium, while Bingham will hold separate negotiations with British Prime Minister Chamberlain. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Republican Senator Borah issued a warning to the government today, stating that the United States' diplomatic policy in the Far East should not sacrifice the friendship between the United States and Japan before British-Japanese relations deteriorate. It is permissible for the United States to exchange views with other countries in accordance with the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty, but it would be a great mistake to assume a leading position and provoke Japan's anger. Finally, Borah stated that the United States can sympathize with China in the Sino-Japanese War, but at the same time, it must avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Conference</h3>

<h3>Enemies in Wu Jia Zha Hall Still Surrounded by Our Troops</h3>
<p>Cut into Small Groups and Surrounded by Our Fierce Attacks; Shen Xin Textile Mill and North Xin Jing Cleared; Enemy Attack Repelled in Guangfu Area</p>
<p>The bloody battle on the south bank of the Suzhou River continues to unfold. In the two sections of North Xin Jing, from east to Zhoujia Bridge and west to Wu Jia Zha and Yaojia Zhai, enemy troops continue to attempt to cross the river stealthily, and our troops continue to work hard to wipe them out. Most of the enemy troops who crossed the river are concentrated in several places in the west section of North Xin Jing to the mouth of Shen Ji Bang, including Ting Tou, Wu Jia Zha, and Yaojia Zhai. They have crossed the river successively and are surrounded by our troops, numbering about two to three thousand. From Wu Jia Zha, they can spy on our Hongqiao Road and airfield, and advance westward to attack the rear of Jiangqiao Town, threatening Nanxiang. Those in Zhoujia Bridge and Liu Jia Zhai are only supporting them. Since the enemy's main force is concentrated in that area, the fierce fighting has been the most intense in that area for several days. After our troops launched a fierce attack, they have defeated and wiped out many of them. Our troops used crossfire, concentrated on bombing the riverbank, generating great power, and killing many enemy troops along the river. Under the fierce artillery fire of our troops, the enemy troops dared not continue to cross the river. Those who had already crossed the river were scattered in Ting Tou, Wu Jia Zha, and Yaojia Zhai, still under the strict encirclement of our troops. In order to eliminate them as soon as possible, yesterday our troops used fresh troops to launch a fierce attack on the enemy, breaking through from the middle, cutting the enemy into several small groups. Although the artillery fire and bullets were as dense as rain, they still bravely advanced. Although our troops suffered some losses, the enemy suffered heavy casualties. They are still being surrounded in small groups. The section east of North Xin Jing to Zhoujia Bridge, close to the concession, has fewer enemy troops crossing the river than the west section. The remaining enemies in the Shen Xin Textile Mill have all been wiped out. The areas north of Robegen Road and near North Xin Jing have also been cleared. Only a small number of enemies who sneaked across from Chenjia Ferry to Liu Jia Zhai are still hiding in the ruins of various Western-style houses, stubbornly resisting, which is not a cause for concern. Yesterday, the artillery battle between the two sides was very fierce. The enemy troops densely bombarded from the north bank, attempting to cover the remaining enemies to break through and advance. Our troops fiercely bombarded the riverbank with dense artillery fire. The rumbling sound did not stop all day. As of this morning, according to reports from the front, our troops are continuing to advance towards the riverbank, and the time of elimination should not be far away.</p>
<h3>Remaining Enemies at Shen Xin Textile Mill Annihilated</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 7 p.m. on the 4th that the remaining enemies hiding in the basement of the Shen Xin Textile Mill on the south bank of the Suzhou River had been bravely stormed into by our troops for searching and annihilation since yesterday. Yesterday (the 3rd), nine enemies were killed, and one light machine gun, five Type 38 rifles, one pistol, two regimental flags, two gas masks, and one bronze plaque were seized. Today (the 4th), at about 1 p.m., another assault was launched, killing fourteen enemies. Thus, all the remaining enemies were annihilated, and four light machine guns, fourteen Type 38 rifles, and many other military supplies were seized.</p>
<h3>Enemies in North Xin Jing Cleared</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the fighting along the Suzhou River has not stopped from the early morning of the day before yesterday until late at night. The enemy troops sneaked across the river in many places, and although they made their greatest efforts, they all suffered heavy blows. The artillery fired by our troops was exceptionally accurate, destroying two of the pontoon bridges built in the Chenjia Ferry area, and one pontoon bridge near North Xin Jing was also destroyed. Therefore, the enemy troops could not cross. After nightfall, the enemy troops attempted to sneak across again in the North Xin Jing area. When they landed ashore and had not yet dispersed, our troops rushed to the shore, intercepted the enemy, and wiped out the enemy troops by dawn yesterday. Many enemy corpses were abandoned on the shore. About two hundred enemy troops from Chenjia Ferry and Ji Jia Bridge used machine guns to form a fire net to cover the forced crossing. After our troops waited for them to land, they surrounded them from three sides and intercepted them, killing nearly a hundred. The remaining troops fled to the houses along the river, still trying to fight to the death. Our troops are trying to wipe them out.</p>
<h3>Remaining Enemies in Liu Jia Zhai Under Siege</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 12:30 p.m. on the 4th that the remaining enemies scattered in Western-style houses west of Liu Jia Zhai on the south bank of the Suzhou River had been under siege by our troops. After a fierce battle all night yesterday, more than seventy people were killed by us again. As of this morning, there were still forty or fifty survivors. The enemy troops on the north bank could not provide rescue, so they shelled across the river with small howitzers to prevent our troops from pursuing. Our troops are now closely monitoring to prevent the enemy from crossing the river to reinforce them.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Between Our Troops and Enemies in Xu Jia Bridge Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 1:10 p.m. on the 4th that the river channel near Shen Ji Bang in the west section of the Suzhou River is relatively narrow. The enemy has been sneaking across the river for several days, reaching more than two thousand people. After being intercepted by our troops, they were surrounded separately in Yaojia Zhai along the river and Wu Jia Zha and Ting Tou, etc. On the 3rd, our troops launched a fierce attack, killing many enemies, and our troops also made heroic sacrifices. Last night, the enemy crossed the river again to reinforce them and tried to connect all the places together. Therefore, the fighting has been extremely fierce from last night to this morning. The enemy troops in Wu Jia Zha and Ting Tou joined forces to attack Yaojia Zhai to the west. The enemy broke through at one point, causing a part of our troops in Ting Tou to have their retreat cut off. Then our troops counterattacked and restored the original position at midnight, and took the opportunity to advance from Yaojia Zhai and Yuji Dun, etc., to attack the enemy fiercely to support them. This morning, there was a fierce battle in Xu Jia Bridge. At the same time, part of the enemy troops in Wu Jia Zha also attacked our Caijia Zhai position to the south, but were repelled by our counterattack.</p>
<h3>Enemy Morale Shaken in Street Fighting in Ting Tou</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, our troops launched a counterattack against the remaining enemies trapped in Ting Tou the night before last. Our soldiers bravely stormed in, occupied many houses, and fired at the enemy. Because the two sides were exceptionally close, the enemy's artillery could not exert its skills. Our troops then displayed their skills in street fighting, advancing step by step and killing many enemies. The enemy's morale was shaken, and although they resisted stubbornly, they retreated due to exhaustion, fleeing to Yaojia Zhai and Wu Jia Zha. Our troops immediately tracked them down and surrounded them separately.</p>
<h3>Mixed Warfare Situation Formed on the South Bank of the Suzhou River</h3>
<p>The enemy's original plan for sneaking across the Suzhou River was to first occupy footholds in various key locations, then establish contact, and cover the crossing of large units and heavy weapons, etc., before launching a large-scale attack. However, our troops knew their plan in advance, so they pursued and encircled them before the enemy could gain a firm foothold, wiping them out separately. After suffering heavy losses for several days, the enemy changed their strategy, pouring all their strength into the Wu Jia Zha and Ting Tou areas. The enemy troops have been constantly reinforcing them, trying their best to expand outwards. After a fierce battle all day yesterday, they were confined to an area of less than a thousand meters along the river. A mixed warfare situation has formed between the two sides. According to a report from a Central News Agency war correspondent at 9:45 p.m. last night, the battle situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Current Situation of the Two Armies' Frontlines</p>
<p>The west section of the Suzhou River starts from North Xin Jing and protrudes northward into a semicircle, with Yaojia Zhai as its apex. Shen Ji Bang on the opposite bank corresponds to our troops across the river, and the defensive line is solid. This semicircular position has Pi Ya Shi Road as its base, which is two kilometers long from north to south, and two small banks bisect the entire area into three. Xu Pu connects the western end. The enemy troops who crossed from the north bank first occupied Wu Jia Ku and Ting Tou. Although they were surrounded by us, their retreat was not cut off. After days of reinforcements, they have expanded considerably. In order to eradicate their power, our troops have mobilized a large army and set a deadline for clearing them out. Our current main frontline stretches from Zhang Jiang Ferry along Zhujia Bang to Bazi Bridge, turns north, and defends Chenjia Alley's wall. This line is approximately five hundred to eight hundred meters from the Suzhou River.</p>
<p>Battle for Yaojia Zhai</p>
<p>At 8 p.m. the night before last, the enemy troops continued to increase, exceeding two thousand. The enemy then attacked Yaojia Zhai from Yingtou to the north, and their momentum was very fierce, and they even broke through. However, at midnight, our troops immediately counterattacked and restored the original position. When the enemy troops withdrew, they suddenly attacked west again, advancing to the Yuji Dun line, threatening our Yaojia Zhai. We had to retreat west again, but still left a part to hold the village and fight the enemy calmly. At this time, our troops in Tian Du Zhai along the river launched a fierce attack on the enemy in Yuji Dun. After a fierce battle all night, our battalion commander Bai Chengkui was unfortunately shot and killed while leading his troops in a charge, sacrificing his life for the country. However, the soldiers bravely charged, and one part broke out that night, while another part remained and fought the enemy.</p>
<p>Jiang Zhai Enemies Surrounded</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the enemy troops occupied Jiangjia Zhai along a small bank from Yuji Dun and Ting Tou to the west, and built fortifications along the bank. At 3 p.m., our troops attacked and broke through the enemy from Chenjia Alley and Huajia Zhai, heavily surrounding the enemy troops in Jiangjia Zhai. In addition, when our troops wiped out the enemy troops in the Ting Tou area the day before yesterday, they had recovered half of it. Yesterday morning, the enemy troops attacked from Chenjia Zhai and Wu Jia Jun from both sides, and we were attacked from both sides. Although our troops suffered considerable sacrifices, they were still fighting. At 1 p.m., the enemy in Wu Jia Ku attacked south, and our Caijia Zhai and the unnamed small village to its west were broken through by them. The enemy then gained a foothold on the north bank of Zhujia Bang, and our troops firmly defended the south bank.</p>
<p>Bayi Bridge's Melee</p>
<p>Until 6 p.m., the enemy's pressure continued unabated, and they even crossed Zhujia Bang and launched a fierce attack on our Bayi Bridge position. After a brief contact with the outpost, the fierce battle lasted for about two hours. The enemy troops had approached our position to less than one hundred meters. Our troops immediately jumped out of the trenches and charged at the enemy in a melee. The enemy also fought stubbornly. As of the reporter's report, the bloody battle was still ongoing. In addition, a small number of enemy troops crossed the river near Zhoujia Bridge yesterday morning and were intercepted and driven back by us. Four light machine guns and seven rifles were seized, and it was discovered on the enemy's corpses that the unit belonged to the 68th Regiment of the 3rd Division.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attacks in Guangfu Repelled</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 11 p.m. on the 4th that on the afternoon of the 3rd, several hundred enemies attacked our positions near Guangfu. Our defending troops responded calmly, killing many enemies and seizing twenty-four rifles, two light machine guns, and two wooden-holstered pistols.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Kunshan on the 4th stated that due to continuous rain in recent days, there have been fierce battles between our troops and the enemy in the area around Guangfu Shi Xiangong Temple, but the positions have not changed. The positions of our left and right wings have been shifted from a curved line to a vertical line, and the fortifications are exceptionally solid. Part of the southwest and east of Shanghai is still under the control of our heavy troops. According to observations, the enemy is still plotting to break through in the center, attempting to attack our Nanxiang area positions from the southwest of Shanghai. Our side has strengthened its defenses.</p>
<h3>A Japanese Warplane Shot Down in Jiading</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 11:00 PM on the 4th that at around 10:00 AM yesterday, eight enemy aircraft bombed near Jiading. Our ×× battalion immediately used anti-aircraft machine guns and anti-aircraft artillery to fire at the enemy planes. One enemy heavy bomber was shot down by us, crashed to the ground and was destroyed. The three airmen inside were also burned to death.</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Continued Bombing Yesterday</p>
<p>In the Pudong area, enemy aircraft again indiscriminately bombed yesterday. At around 6:00 AM, two enemy planes first circled and reconnoitered over the Yangjing Town, Lannidu, and Tangqiao Town areas, leaving at 7:30 AM. At 8:45 AM, three heavy bombers flew over the towns along the Pudong coast. Subsequently, they dropped more than a dozen bombs on Pudong Avenue north of Yangjing and Jiajiajiao, etc. At the same time, an enemy gunboat moored at buoy No. 21 in the Huangpu River also fiercely shelled Yangjing Town, stopping at around 9:00 AM. More than a dozen civilian houses were destroyed, and seven or eight innocent civilians were killed or injured. From 1:00 PM, three enemy aircraft continued to bomb Yangjing Town and Tangqiao Town in Pudong, dropping more than twenty bombs in succession, killing three residents, injuring six, and destroying more than a dozen civilian houses. At around 3:00 PM, an enemy gunboat moored at buoy No. 14 in the Huangpu River suddenly shelled our Pudong again. At the same time, another three enemy planes reconnoitered back and forth over Lujiadu, Yangjiadu, Zhangjiabang, and Yangjing, etc., not only bombing from time to time, but also flying low and strafing with machine guns. The enemy gunboat stopped shelling at around 4:00 PM, while the enemy planes only left after the sun set in the west. In the Hongqiao area of Shanghai, multiple enemy aircraft went to operate at 7:20 AM yesterday morning, and did not fly back to their base in Yangshupu one after another until 10:30 AM. From 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM in the afternoon, more than twenty enemy aircraft wreaked havoc in the Zhoujiaqiao area of Shanghai, including six giant three-engine heavy bombers. They dropped more than thirty bombs. The Dagong News Agency reporter was observing from the roof of a very tall building on Jessfield Road at the time, and saw the enemy planes dropping bombs back and forth in a parallel manner, not daring to fly low. As a result, their aim was inaccurate, and seven out of ten bombs landed in the fields. The rest landed in civilian houses, having absolutely no impact on our military. At the same time, when the enemy planes dropped bombs, our army fired anti-aircraft machine guns, but unfortunately did not hit them, but it did pose a major threat to the enemy planes.</p>
<p>In the Nanshi area, from 6:00 AM to 9:20 AM yesterday morning, enemy aircraft reconnoitered in the Nanshi area five times, each time with four heavy bombers, divided into two teams. They first circled around the city, and then went to Gaochang Temple and the Huangpu River waterfront to reconnoiter, but did not drop bombs and left. At around 10:00 AM, a seaplane from the enemy flagship "Izumo" in the Huangpu River suddenly took off, flying to Pudong Nanshi, as well as Lannidu and the Bund No. 16 wharf, flying very low, but in less than ten minutes, it flew back to its original landing place on the Huangpu River near the Gonghexiang area.</p>
<p>The Enemy Has Shipped in Another Large Batch of Munitions</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, two converted enemy merchant ships, the Shanghai Maru and the Takashima Maru, sailed into Shanghai, docking at the Wayson and Huangpu wharves respectively, unloading a large batch of munitions and military supplies. The enemy transport ship No. 43, the Sorachi Maru, which sailed into Shanghai a few days ago, set sail and returned to Japan at around noon yesterday.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Refugee Zone Established, Police Authority Entirely Under Our Control</h3>
<p>The Location is Tentatively Set to Be About Three Li Wide. No Agreement is Signed, but Our Side Agrees to Consider It.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government has repeatedly received suggestions from the British, French, and American diplomatic authorities in Shanghai, as well as charitable organizations, to designate a part of Nanshi as a refugee reception area, which should not be damaged by any party. Outsiders are unaware of this and are widely rumored that Nanshi will be turned into a neutral zone, which is a misunderstanding. The details obtained from official sources are explained as follows:</p>
<p>Since the August 13th Resistance War, refugees have gathered in large numbers in the Shanghai concession area, and it is impossible to accommodate them all. Therefore, the Chinese Red Cross and the International Relief Committee suggested opening a section of Nanshi as a reception center to accommodate as many war zone refugees as possible and maintain humanitarianism. At that time, many foreign Catholic and Christian friends also expressed strong support, saying that there are many churches in Nanshi, which are now vacant and can be used for reception. Therefore, Father Yao, a Frenchman, initiated the proposal and, through the British, French, and American diplomatic authorities in Shanghai, approached our municipal government for discussion.</p>
<p>Our side takes the principle of not losing territorial sovereignty as the basis: (1) No negotiations will be conducted with the Japanese side. (2) This is an international refugee relief matter and is by no means a disguised concession. No foreign country may interfere with China's territorial sovereignty. (3) Foreign countries may not send troops to garrison or need foreign armed protection. The security of the area will be the responsibility of our police. (4) No agreement will be signed. Our authorities will consider any proposal that does not violate the above principles.</p>
<p>The area has been roughly defined as: north to Avenue Edward VII, south to Fangbang Road, east to Anren Street, and west to Fangbang Bridge on Avenue Edward VII. At that time, three representatives from China, France, the United States, and Britain will be selected respectively to jointly manage the affairs with charitable organizations. All of this will be temporary in nature and will end when the Shanghai war ends.</p>
<h3>What a Western Newspaper Representative Saw on a Cruise Along the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Many Wooden Houses Have Been Built Amidst the Ruins of Wusong Town. A Batch of Giant Airships and Small Boats are Moored in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>The English-language China Press reported that a representative of the China Press toured the Huangpu River yesterday afternoon, counting a total of 41 Japanese warships in the Huangpu River from the Bund to Wusong, and 42 more in the Yangtze River outside the Wusong Estuary. No transport ships were seen in Wusong, but there were several aircraft carriers outside the Wusong Estuary. The planes on the carriers flew to the front line every morning and returned at any time to reload bombs and fly out again. About three supply ships arrived that day, and one cruiser and two destroyers sailed out of Wusong. Wusong Town has become a pile of ruins, but the Japanese army has built some temporary wooden houses for barracks, offices, and storage warehouses, etc., and has set up a military hospital, where hundreds of convalescing wounded soldiers are resting. The Gongping Bureau Wharf and the Qiujiang Road Wharf are piled high with war supplies and military needs, and many military trucks are traveling back and forth on the Songhu Highway, transporting goods to the eastern and northern districts of the concession, as well as to the front line. It is reported that the highway is deeply sunken and lower than the surrounding land due to the heavy traffic and prolonged rain. The ruins of the old Wusong Fort Hotel have been filled in and several wooden houses have been built. Yesterday afternoon, a Japanese airship, whose size was rarely seen in the Huangpu River, was moored in the Huangpu River. The Japanese army has transported a large number of small boats, which were previously used to transport troops and land on the banks of the Yangtze River and Wusong, from the Yangtze River to the Huangpu River, and they are now moored near the Wayson Wharf and Yangshupu, or may be used to transport troops in an attempt to land in Pudong.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Discuss Countermeasures to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Foreign Affairs Association is Established</p>
<p>In view of the importance of the Brussels Conference and its impact on our country's diplomacy, the Shanghai Professors and Writers Association, the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association, the Joint Association of University Faculty and Staff, and other groups, recently sent invitations to all sectors to discuss countermeasures at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge at 2:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Zhu Fojiu and Yuan Yang'an, representatives of the Lawyers Association; Chen Xianmo, representative of the Accountants Association; Jiang Haifan, representative of the Professors and Writers Association; Du Gangbai, representative of the Joint Association of University Faculty and Staff; Lu Yifeng, representative of the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association; and Dai Yingfu, Zhang Jixian, Gui Zhongshu, Chen Hongfan, Cui Weiwu, Zhai Junqian, Fan Guang, Chen Jinmin, Xue Nongshan, and others, more than fifty people in total. Cui Weiwu was elected chairman and Chen Jinmin as recorder. First, Mr. Cui reported on the significance of the Brussels Conference, and then they began to discuss countermeasures and decided to organize the Chinese National Foreign Affairs Association. The charter and many important proposals were passed, and Gui Zhongqu, Cui Weiwu, Huang Renzhi, Zhang Jixian, Jiang Wenyu, Dai Yingfu, Zhai Junqian, Chen Hongfan, etc. were elected as directors and supervisors. At the same time, a declaration and telegram were issued to inform the people of the country and present the conference. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Declaration To All Compatriots of the Country, Since September 18th, Japanese imperialism has kicked over the League of Nations with one foot and torn up the Nine-Power Treaty with one hand, invading China's territory, destroying world peace, and becoming the evil demon of the Far East and the public enemy of mankind. In order to defend the survival of our nation, we were forced to wage a full-scale war of resistance. In the process of this full-scale war of resistance, because we are a member of the League of Nations and a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty, in addition to fighting to the end with our heads and blood to seek final victory, we have had to appeal to the League of Nations and call on the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty to promote human justice and implement sanctions against Japan. Now the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has officially opened in Brussels. From the standpoint of our national foreign affairs, we should have ardent hope for this conference, but we should not harbor the slightest illusion. We firmly oppose fruitless delays and unnecessary mediation. We sincerely demand that Japan's crimes be judged, and that it be declared an aggressor before all mankind, that it be whipped to immediately withdraw all its invading land, sea, and air forces from China, and restore the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. Before Japan automatically repents of its sins, it should provide as much "substantial" assistance to China as possible and "active" sanctions against Japan. We know that the rights and wrongs and interests of international relations are often intricate, contradictory, and may lead the conference into more difficult situations. However, we firmly believe that any decision that disregards the interests of the Chinese nation is unacceptable to us. We vow to use the determination to sacrifice everything to back up the government's diplomacy, so that negotiation and battle have the same effect, and to lead China through a period of crisis and towards the road to rejuvenation.

<h3>Our Troops in Northern Shanxi Move to New Positions at Shiling Pass</h3>
<p>Waging Guerrilla Warfare Behind Enemy Lines. Our Troops on the Pinghan Railway Change Strategy. Contact on the Left Flank of the Jinpu Railway Yesterday.</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Our troops on the Pinghan Railway have changed their strategy. Fresh troops on the front have arrived at the front line and are launching a fierce attack towards Shizhuang, cutting off the enemy's rear route in eastern Henan. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>[Jinan] Military news: (1) More than a hundred enemies were discovered near Shilipu, south of Pingyuan County, yesterday afternoon. Our guerrillas went to suppress them. The enemy set fire to the nearby villages and fled north. It is estimated that more than twenty enemies were killed and more than ten rifles were captured. (2) This morning, more than four hundred enemies with three cannons and two tanks attacked Zhengjiazhai in Fenghuangdian. A fierce battle is currently underway. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>[Kaifeng] The enemies in Anyang are mostly puppet Mongolian troops, with only one or twenty in each village in Guozhuqiukou. There are more in Donghuiying Dachenji, and they are wantonly harassing the area, especially brutally killing people in Dongxi Caiku villages. Now, our fresh troops on the Pinghan front have arrived, and the left and right wings have also advanced to appropriate locations and will launch a major counterattack. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>[Jinan] People from the front reported that there are about six or seven thousand enemies south of Dezhou, including about two thousand regular Japanese troops and the rest being Liu Guitang's mixed army and puppet Korean troops. The main force is near Lingxian County, which is guarded by us. The nearby villages and fortresses are frequently attacked by us, and the number of enemies has been greatly reduced, making them extremely panicked. Pingyuan is the headquarters of the enemy Sato Brigade, originally with more than a thousand people, now with more than a thousand reinforcements and about twenty cannons. There are not many enemies in Dezhou, and there are also fewer cannons and a shortage of ammunition. The railway behind the enemy is severely damaged by us and difficult to repair, cutting off their return route. The enemy armored vehicle was detained between Pingyuan and Zhangzhuang, using charcoal instead of coal. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] About 30,000 enemies invaded northern Shanxi. Since mid-October, fierce battles have been fought with our XX unit on the mountain line east and west of Xinkou Town, south of Yuanping, for more than twenty days. Although the enemy has been constantly reinforcing, our army has also repeatedly launched fierce attacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Because the enemy has been frequently attacked by our side, they know that they cannot win and have gradually built solid fortifications, trying to fight to the death. In order to avoid the unnecessary sacrifice of positional warfare and to take advantage of the favorable terrain of the mountains in northern Shanxi, we lured the enemy away from their positions, gradually annihilating them. On the evening of the 3rd, we automatically retreated strategically towards Shiling Pass (40 li south of Xinxian), and on the one hand, we prepared to carry out guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, cutting off their reinforcements and supplies, and on the other hand, we prepared to launch a more fierce attack on the enemy from the new positions.

In addition, our guerrillas bypassed to the west of Pingyuan at noon on the 3rd and launched a surprise attack on the enemy, winning a small victory. It is estimated that more than twenty enemies were killed and more than ten rifles were captured (4th dispatch from the Central News Agency).</p>

<h3>Burmese Indian Overseas Chinese Gather</h3>
<p>Severing Economic Ties with Japan and Expressing Sympathy for China</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Yangon communication, the violence of the Japanese bombing of undefended cities in our country and the massacre of civilians, world public opinion has long been unanimously criticized, and the Indian people also sympathize with our country. Jawaharlal Nehru, President of the Indian National Congress, set September 26 as "China Day", leading the people of the country to implement a boycott of Japanese goods, and issued a declaration condemning the atrocities of the Japanese army. There are a large number of Indian Overseas Chinese in Burma. On that day, the Yangon branch of the Indian National Congress also followed the orders of the President of the Congress, held a gathering, and sent a letter to the Burmese Overseas Chinese Disaster Relief Association, inviting members to attend. The meeting place was located at the Indian Uccana Association Hall. The meeting opened at 10:00 AM, and a large number of people attended. In addition to the three members sent by the Disaster Relief Association, more than 30 well-known figures from the overseas Chinese community attended. The chairman was Jiao Ruichienyi, Vice President of the Burmese Branch of the Indian National Congress. First, he delivered a speech, stating that since Japan occupied China's Northeast territory in 1932, it has been deliberately trying to annex the entire China in order to conquer the world. Today, Japan is deploying troops in North China and Shanghai, which is a consistent aggressive policy. India and Burma have close relations with China. We cannot sit idly by in the face of Japan's illegal atrocities. India and Burma are Japan's largest business customers. We should protest to Japan. If Japan continues to invade China, our only way is to sever economic relations with Japan. Implement it for three months, and Japan will inevitably suffer from its pain, etc. Many delegates to the meeting spoke one after another. Finally, it was resolved: (1) Japan's bombing of undefended cities in China is brutal and hurts the feelings of the Indian and Burmese people. (2) Express deep sympathy for the innocent suffering of the Chinese people, and pray that China's war of resistance can win the final victory. (3) The Indian and Burmese people unite and sever commercial and other relations with Japan, and strive to boycott Japan in all aspects. In addition, the Youth Party of Burma and the Catholic-run middle schools and elementary schools for boys and girls have also expressed their views on Japan's atrocities, and they generally sympathize with our war of resistance.

<h3>Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Publishes a Thesis</h3>
<p>Soviet Foreign Policy</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Melamed wrote an article entitled Soviet Foreign Policy. He first stated that Soviet foreign policy is based on two main principles: 1. National self-determination respects the independent sovereignty of all countries; 2. Fighting for peace. Litvinov worked hard for peace, signing non-aggression treaties with Turkey in 1925, with Afghanistan and Iran in 1927, with Poland in 1932, with Finland, Latvia, and France, Czechoslovakia, Italy, and recently with China. He particularly pointed out that Japan resolutely refused to sign a non-aggression treaty, but the Soviet Union will never limit itself to these non-aggression treaties that have become the greatest contribution to the cause of maintaining peace, and has also signed mutual assistance treaties with France and Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Union's fight for peace is not because of its weakness or fear of war. The Soviet Union is well aware that current international organizations still cannot guarantee collective security. The Soviet Union is therefore preparing for accidents. The Soviet Red Army is not only prepared with the highest degree of strength, but is working to promote the cause of peace and is prepared to strike at those who undermine peace. 180 million Soviet people are working to make it impossible for them to disrupt.

<h3>Enemy Air Raids in Guangdong Intensify Disruption of Transportation</h3>
<p>Bombing of Guangzhou-Kowloon Passenger Train: Britain Lodges Protest; Guangzhou-Hankou Train and Xinhui Station Also Damaged</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: For the past half-month, enemy planes have been bombing railways throughout Guangdong Province in an attempt to disrupt transportation. However, the enemy planes, not daring to fly low, have only managed to damage a small number of tracks with their bombs. Major bridges on the lines have not been damaged. Only civilian houses near the bombed locations have suffered, and the local people have been victimized. Since October 23rd, enemy planes have been bombing not only key transportation areas but also railway locomotives and passenger trains. As a result, passengers on all lines have been living in fear for the past few days. When travel is necessary, most prefer boats over land routes. It has been learned that at 11 AM on the 23rd, twenty-three enemy planes first went to the Yingde Station on the southern section of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, taking turns dropping no fewer than forty or fifty bombs. Bombs also fell on Yingde city, destroying many civilian houses. Yingde Station and Lidong Station were both destroyed. Four or five railway workers were killed or wounded, and food shops and workers' dormitories next to the station were completely flattened. On that day, twelve passenger cars arrived near Yingde. Upon discovering that Yingde was being bombed, they stopped immediately. The enemy planes circled above the stopped passenger cars, first strafing downwards with machine guns, causing passengers in the carriages to flee in panic. Soon after, the enemy planes suddenly dropped over ten bombs in succession on the train. More than twenty passengers were wounded on the spot because they could not escape in time, and four were killed. In an instant, the carriages caught fire from the bombs and burned until 6 PM. All twelve passenger cars were reduced to ashes. It is reported that sixteen people died of severe injuries while being sent to Yingde for medical treatment. On the 24th, a large formation of enemy planes attacked again, dropping seven or eight bombs at Juntian Station and over ten bombs at Lianjiangkou. The Lianjiangkou Station was destroyed, and dozens were killed or wounded.</p>
<p>The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway has suffered repeated bombings by enemy planes. On the 24th, over twenty enemy planes first bombed the Shilong Railway Bridge. The enemy planes then flew to Nanshe Station, encountering the first passenger-freight train from Guangzhou to Kowloon temporarily stopped at the station. They immediately strafed the passenger-freight train and bombed the carriages. Passengers fled into the woods, and six or seven were wounded by machine gun fire along the way, and two were killed. Several passenger carriages were destroyed. The wounded were sent from Nanshe Station to Shilong Hospital for treatment. After bombing the Guangzhou-Kowloon carriages, the enemy planes flew to Zhangmutou and Tutang stations to drop bombs, destroying workers' dormitories and tracks at Zhangmutou Station. Over ten lengths of track were also destroyed at Tutang Station. The Hong Kong government, citing the Japanese planes' bombing of defenseless passenger trains, the destruction of Guangzhou-Kowloon railway cars, and the damage to British investment in the railway, has telegraphed the Japanese planes' atrocities to London. The British government in London has instructed the British Ambassador to Japan to protest to Japan and demand compensation for the damage caused by the bombing of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the destruction of carriages. The destroyed carriages have now been transported to Kowloon, Hong Kong, for public display, so that people around the world may deeply understand the cruelty of Japanese planes.</p>
<p>On the 24th, before bombing the Guangzhou-Kowloon train, the enemy sent six planes to bomb Taishan and Ningyang, dropping over ten bombs, destroying over thirty civilian houses, and killing or wounding over twenty local people. Around 8 AM, after the enemy planes had committed their atrocities, they joined a large formation of about twenty-four planes to bomb the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. After bombing the Guangzhou-Kowloon train, they returned through Ningyang in two small groups at 2 PM, dropping five or six bombs, and then flew back to the enemy aircraft carrier at Chiwan. On the morning of the 25th, four enemy planes took off from the enemy ship off Ya'men. Around 8 AM, they flew to Jiangmen in Xinhui County and reconnoitered for about ten minutes. At that time, there were over a hundred passengers at Jiangmen North Street Station (across the sea is Taishan Station on the Ningyang Railway). Seeing the enemy planes arrive, they fled in panic. Soon after, the enemy planes dropped thirteen large bombs at low altitude and strafed nearby civilian houses with guns. Among the civilian houses and shops that were bombed and collapsed nearby were the Mingyuan Teahouse, the Jiangwan Ancient Temple, and three civilian houses at the foot of Zhumeshan, and a medical clinic. Altogether, over thirty people were killed or wounded. Another enemy plane circled over the Xinhui County Government and dropped a bomb, destroying an office building in the county government.

<h3>Archaeologists Confirm Appearance of "Peking Man"</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Archaeologists today confirmed for the first time the appearance of the earliest human being. The only missing part of the skull of the so-called "Peking Man," namely the maxilla, has been assembled in the anatomy department of Xiehe Hospital since its discovery.

<h3>The Defensive Battle on the Zhang River Line</h3>
<p>— From Zhou</p>
<p>The Improved Situation on the Pinghan Railway</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency Battlefield Correspondent: The battle situation on the Pinghan Railway can be roughly divided into three stages. The first stage was from the withdrawal of defenses from Pingjin to the fall of Baoding. The second stage was from the fall of Baoding to the loss of Shijiazhuang. After the loss of Shijiazhuang, it can be said that we entered the third stage.</p>
<p>Since the war on the Pinghan Railway entered the third stage, the enemy's strength has consistently been two divisions and a brigade, while the front line has been extended to over a thousand li. In my two articles on the new situation in the northern battlefield, I pointed out that our strategy is one of attrition. The longer the war is drawn out, the more it will benefit us. On the entire northern battlefield, the enemy has not yet encountered our main force. Our strategic retreat is only evident along the railway line, in the suburbs of Pingjin, and along the Taihang Mountains. We still have countless soldiers active, with the possibility of raiding the enemy's rear and cutting off their communications at any time. At the same time, the wider the area occupied by the enemy, the greater the depletion and dispersion of their strength. On the vast plain of Hebei, we can launch a combination of guerrilla warfare and positional warfare. However, the stubborn enemy, disregarding these strategic difficulties, is boldly taking military risks. The defensive battle on the Zhang River line has finally been met with a blow from our brave soldiers.</p>
<p>The Zhang River originates in Shanxi, with two streams, one clear and one turbid. The clear stream comes from Zhanling, and the turbid stream comes from Fajiu Mountain. These two streams meet at Liuhegou, sixty-five li north of Anyang, and flow east across the railway line, passing through Hebei Province and entering the Wei River. Anyang, formerly the capital of Zhangde Prefecture, is located between Yan and Jin, at the crossroads of the Pinghan Railway entering Henan, and is the northern gateway to Henan. The Zhang River happens to flow through the north of Anyang City. If we want to defend Henan, we must defend Anyang. To defend Anyang, we must first defend the Zhang River line. Our strategy is to build step by step, secure each position, with every mountain top as our inner fortress, every forest as our moat, and every river as our natural barrier. It was already expected that the enemy would encounter a serious blow from us on the Zhang River line.</p>
<p>It is true that after the fall of Baoding, we continued to lose many important strategic areas. However, the enemy's momentary local victories were bought at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. Our brave soldiers have truly achieved the spirit of "not being arrogant in victory, nor discouraged in defeat." On the evening of January 18th, the vanguard of the enemy was discovered in Cixian, consisting of sixteen tanks and about five hundred cavalry, launching a bloody battle on our national defense works that had been built for more than half a year. Then, the enemy's main force arrived, with a brigade-sized force. Part of our troops were still on the south bank of the Zhang River, and part were retreating from Zhengding, consisting of troops with weaker combat capabilities. At that time, Cixian was already heavily surrounded by the enemy. Our commander, a certain Mr., remained very calm despite being in such a critical situation, planning the military situation. On the one hand, he ordered the fresh troops on the south bank of the Zhang River to quickly cross the river and take on the frontal defense. On the other hand, he strictly ordered the retreating troops to reorganize as soon as possible and guard the left and right wings of the railway line. After a night of bloody battle, the enemy finally crossed Cixian and advanced south along the railway line. In order to crush the enemy's 'central breakthrough' strategy, we have always guarded the front of the railway. The commander of a certain army took a special train, and although enemy shells were constantly falling nearby, our commander remained calm as usual, directing the troops to resist. By the morning of the 19th, the enemy had reached Anyang Station on the north bank of the Zhang River. The sound of artillery fire was constantly heard. The Zhang River Bridge had long been destroyed to prevent the enemy from advancing south along the railway line. Thus, a fierce positional battle was launched again on the north bank of the Zhang River. At this time, the enemy's strategy was: first, to fiercely attack the positions of our army on the Zhang River line with concentrated artillery fire; second, to use a part of their cavalry to bypass Liuhegou, sixty-five li northwest of Anyang; and third, to launch a riot by Chinese traitors in Zhangde City. Starting on the 20th, the enemy used the cover of concentrated artillery fire to attempt to cross the Zhang River by wading. A certain army commander, known for his defense of ××, personally directed the battle on the front line, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Near Liuhegou, our army had already completed deployments before the 16th, so the bypassing enemy was trapped in a heavy encirclement. The traitorous riot in Zhangde was also under our army's strict surveillance and did not erupt on a large scale. More than two hundred people were captured on the 21st, so it can be said that this traitorous work completely failed. The enemy's first plan had been completely crushed. At the same time, the left wing of our army also advanced to Cixian, and the main force arrived at Matouzhen, north of the Zhang River. Starting on the 22nd, our silver-winged planes began to soar over the stations on the north bank of the Zhang River, destroying the enemy's military supplies, military engineering, and two armored trains. The enemy's right wing gradually became unable to hold out. Lines of tanks staggered toward the Jinpu Railway in the northeast. On the 23rd, the enemy opened a large number of reinforcements from the Jinpu Line, united the defeated enemy troops, with aircraft, artillery, and amphibious tanks, to attack our Henan positions again. That night, an enemy regiment of about 2,000 people attempted to cross the Zhang River, and a fierce battle broke out again. Our brave soldiers made heroic sacrifices. Two regimental commanders were killed, one regimental commander was seriously wounded, and over eighty company-grade and junior officers were killed or wounded, as were over a thousand soldiers. However, our flesh and blood ultimately became our Great Wall. The enemy who attempted to cross the Zhang River had to flee in disarray. On the 24th, the enemy attacked Liuhegou again, and along the Pinghan branch line of Liuhegou, fiercely attacked Fenglezhen, attempting to threaten Anyang from the rear. However, the enemy in Fenglezhen was immediately surrounded by our army. Five hundred prisoners have already been sent south as gifts for our defense of the Zhang River. On the 25th, although the enemy was discovered at Baoliansi, it was clearly the enemy's last gasp. After a counterattack by our fresh troops, the enemy on the south bank of the Zhang River had been completely defeated. On the 26th, our army advanced to Handan, and on the 27th, advanced to Shunde.</p>
<p>The victory of the defensive battle on the Zhang River line laid the foundation for a new unfolding of the situation on the Pinghan Railway. However, the victory of this defensive battle on the Zhang River line was due not only to the dedication of our officers and soldiers and the brave sacrifices of the soldiers, but also to other factors.</p>
<p>First, on the western battlefield, our army encountered heroic resistance. Even the Japanese spokesman had to admit that the Japanese army suffered deeply from mountain warfare. If the western battlefield is lost, the enemy will find it even more difficult to reverse the decline on the northern battlefield.</p>
<p>Second, our army recaptured Pingxing Pass and Zijing Pass, and then captured Laiyuan, and surrounded Yixian and Wangdu in separate attacks. Baoding was already on the danger line, and the enemy's communication on the Pinghan Railway could be cut off at any time.</p>
<p>Third, the situation in northern Manchuria is tense, the volunteers are active, the Outer Mongolia is moving inward, and the guerrilla war is developing in the suburbs of Pingjin. For several days, as many as sixteen trains have been transferred from the Guandong Army to beyond the border. In fact, the enemy had to seek to shorten the defense line to facilitate advances and retreats.</p>
<p>However, we should confirm that the current change in the enemy's strategy is to use all their strength to seize the conditions for victory on the western battlefield, so a fierce offensive and defensive battle will be launched again near Niangziguan.</p>
<p>Breaking through one link of the enemy is to break through the entire link of the enemy. The conditions for ensuring the victory of the defensive battle on the Zhang River line are to continue to advance. When our troops reach Zhengding, they can quickly launch a combination of positional warfare and guerrilla warfare, and make full use of the skills of mobile warfare. The struggle to defend Niangziguan is also an important condition for ensuring victory on the western battlefield.</p>
<p>Finally, we discovered some unsoundness in the organizational structure of some troops in the defensive battle on the Zhang River line, a lack of spiritual education, and a failure to pay attention to improving the lives of soldiers. We hope to gradually correct these bad phenomena in the war of resistance in the spirit of self-criticism, so that every soldier can become a strong fighter.</p>
<p>In addition, on the northern battlefield, apart from the representative of the Nanjing Women's慰勞association going north once, there has been almost no慰勞 since then. The loyal and brave soldiers who defended the country would naturally not care about these things, but we believe that the慰勞 teams and battlefield service groups can indeed boost morale. I sincerely take this opportunity to ask the national support groups to quickly mobilize manpower and resources and go to the northern battlefield in large numbers. (October 28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Situation in Nanshi Became More Peaceful Yesterday</h3>
<p>Store Business Extended; Refugees Gathered in Churches</p>
<p>The situation in Nanshi has been safer since yesterday morning. Those who had moved to the concessions in the previous two days have begun to move back. Store business has also been extended longer than in the past, not closing until 10:30 PM. The areas of Xiaoximen, Laoximen, Dananmen, Xiaodongmen, Minguo Road, and Fangbang Road were relatively prosperous, while the areas of Gaochangmiao remained relatively deserted. The areas within the city walls were also extremely quiet. Catholic churches and public agencies within the city have seen refugees gathering there several times, reaching twenty to thirty thousand people. At the Huazu transportation junction of Nanyang Bridge, 'traffic control' members of the protective corps assisted the police in directing traffic, so order was good, and there was no congestion as in previous days. Yesterday afternoon, two enemy single-wing reconnaissance planes, one in front and one behind, flew from south to north over Nanshi, flying low and fast, but the public did not panic. These enemy planes were probably intended to reconnoiter our Nanshi's movements.</p>
<h3>Returned Travelers from Xiamen Talk About the Tragic Situation in Kinmen</h3>
<p>Refugees Fleeing to Xiamen Have Been Properly Accommodated by the City Government</p>
<p>According to those who recently returned to Shanghai from Xiamen, since Kinmen Island, which belongs to Xiamen, was captured by the enemy, they have been searching and killing able-bodied men, raping women, and plundering civilian property, causing extreme cruelty. Residents, unable to live in peace, have mostly moved to Xiamen. The Xiamen City Government and local public organizations have properly accommodated them. The city and Kinmen are close at hand and in a strategically important location. The current city authorities, from Mayor Gao down, are loyal and diligent, performing their duties as usual and doing their best to prevent traitors, so security and defense are free of concern. However, since the enemy occupied the island, they have been rushing to build fortifications to prevent our army's counterattack.</p>
<h3>Cash Shops Implement New Public Order System</h3>
<p>Notifying All Shops to Implement Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cash Shop Guild's public order system for member cash shops has always stipulated that orders of 500 yuan or more are to be given a large public order, and orders of less than 500 yuan are to be given a small public order. Previously, large public orders were cleared on the same day, and small public orders were cleared at the end of each month. Later, both large and small public orders were cleared by the reserve bank on the same day. Now, upon the proposal of the Executive Committee, the names of large and small public orders will be abolished, and regardless of the amount, including odd amounts, a single public order will be given and cleared every day. This has been passed by the members' general meeting on the 2nd of this month. The guild has notified member cash shops yesterday to prepare for implementation starting today.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Kai-shek Sends Telegram to Thank Women's Movement Association</h3>
<p>And Hopes for Joint Efforts to Accomplish the Entire Task of Resisting the Enemy</p>
<p>The Women's Movement Promotion Association telegraphed its condolences to Madame Chiang Kai-shek after her car accident the day before. Now Madame Chiang Kai-shek has sent a telegram in reply to express her thanks. The text of the telegram is as follows: (omitted above) I have received your respectful telegram.

Chiang Soong Mei-ling bows in Jiang.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Slightly Due to Scarce Arrivals Caused by Rain</h3>
<p>Temporarily Adding 40 Cents per Stone in National Currency; Reduction Will Be Considered When Supply Sources Are Smooth</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Food Regulation Committee recently issued General Notice No. 11, stating: "It has been found that the rice supply in this city has been scarce recently due to continuous rain and few arrivals from the river. The committee is now temporarily allowing an increase of 40 cents per stone in national currency across the board to maintain the cost of rice merchants, starting from the date of this announcement. The highest price of white japonica rice shall not exceed 14 yuan per stone, and medium and inferior grades shall be reduced accordingly. This is specially announced." Chairman Wang Xiaolai, November 4, 26th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Also, the Shanghai Rice Dealers' Guild issued an emergency notice, stating: "Now is an extraordinary period, and the people's food is of utmost importance. All dealers should strictly abide by the prescribed price limits. The highest price for white japonica rice should not exceed 14 yuan per stone, and other grades should be priced accordingly. If there are any violations of the above price limits, we will immediately report to the authorities for strict investigation and disposal. This is specially announced."</p>
<p>It is understood that although rice boats arriving in Shanghai have been fewer than before due to rain in recent days, since the outbreak of the war, all parties in this city have been engaged in collection and storage. The current reserves are also 500,000 dan. At the same time, the Public Concession Food Committee has also ordered white rice from Saigon, Hong Kong, for regulation, so the current reserves in this city can at least maintain the needs of the city's citizens for six months. Moreover, rice from various places is still being transported to Shanghai. If transportation is obstructed, white rice from Saigon, Hong Kong, can still be transported to Shanghai for relief, so the supply of food for the citizens of this city is not a problem at all.</p>
<h3>German Goods All Halted Due to the Impact of the War</h3>
<p>The Brutal Enemy Bestows the Obstruction of North German Shipping</p>
<p>Before the brutal enemy started the war, the import trade in our country was mostly from German goods. Since the enemy warlords first provoked the trouble at Lugouqiao on July 8th, and the full-scale war of resistance began on August 13th, the transport of goods from various countries has been greatly hindered after the enemy illegally blockaded our coastline, especially the goods from Germany. Recently, the North German Lloyd shipping company has almost been unable to sail its ships. At the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the German and Italian states should understand what the war launched by the brutal Japan is affecting.</p>
<h3>Relief for the Unemployed</h3>
<p>Youth Associations for Men and Women Actively Involved</p>
<p>In view of the large number of unemployed youth in the city since the outbreak of the war, the Men’s Youth Association has decided to launch a national goods sales team in order to seek a thorough solution to the relief problem. It is now actively preparing, and the following methods for promoting national goods have been formulated: ㊀ Transfer machine-made products from various ports to the interior; ㊁ Encourage the transport and sale of handicrafts from the interior to various ports; ㊂ Contact local youth associations in Beijing and Hankou to establish sales outlets for national daily necessities; ㊃ Promote the establishment of more national goods stores and consumer cooperatives in the interior, and advise members, etc.; ㊄ The association will quickly organize a national goods sales team to sell national daily necessities, recruit unemployed youth to handle this matter, and assume the responsibility of propaganda and organizing the public.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Women's Youth Association, in view of the large number of women who have been displaced and homeless since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, and whose plight is extremely pitiful, believes that if no measures are taken to provide relief, the future will be unimaginable. The association has launched a women's vocational shelter to accommodate them and has sent a letter to the International Relief Society for assistance. This women's shelter is different from other shelters, as it not only provides simple relief but also teaches various skills to female refugees so that they can have a skill to support themselves.</p>

<h3>Banks and Money Shops Relocate to Original Locations for Business</h3>
<p>Due to Practical Needs, Relocation is Ongoing</p>
<p>Since the war shifted to both sides of Suzhou Creek in western Shanghai, various exchange and money shops in the city have successively relocated to their original locations (around Hou Malu) and resumed business as usual. However, Nan Shi Zhixiang and other shops are still temporarily operating within the safety zone of the public concession. As for the banks, they have also successively relocated to their original locations, including the Shanghai Bank, Yanyeh Bank, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Shanghai Municipal Bank, and Chuanyeh Bank.</p>

<h3>British Chargé d'Affaires Arrives in Shanghai on Official Business</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Return to Beijing Within Days</p>
<p>British Chargé d'Affaires to China, He Wu, traveled by car from Beijing to Hangzhou on official business a few days ago, then went to Ningbo, and then took a British merchant ship, the New Beijing, to Shanghai, arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning. Yesterday afternoon, he went to the British Embassy's Shanghai office on the Bund to handle official business and is scheduled to return to Beijing within days.</p>
<h3>Universities Emphasize Both Classes and Service</h3>
<p>Most Primary and Secondary Schools Adopt Half-Day System</p>
<p>Universities in the city officially started classes on the 1st of this month. During the war of resistance, many university students served in the war zone or various support groups, so some universities allowed students to both attend classes and continue to serve. Most primary and secondary schools adopted a half-day system, hoping that students in the war zone would have the opportunity to attend classes. In addition, the schools of the Public Works Department have also resumed classes as usual. Guo Lianfeng, a supervisor from the Ministry of Education, came to Shanghai to inspect the results and was quite satisfied.</p>
<h3>Ciyou Association Organizes Orphanages</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Chen Tiesheng, Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Chinese Ciyou Association, has traveled to Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan and other places to organize and establish several orphanages in the war zone. Mr. Chen has already returned to Shanghai. The association specially hosted a banquet for Mr. Chen at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at noon yesterday, and he reported on his trip to various places to organize orphanages and planned to continue to organize preparatory committees for orphanages in the war zone in this city and other places.</p>
<p>Group News</p>
<p>The wartime service team of the Chinese Boy Scouts, due to the successive closures of various service organizations in Shanghai, except for those who originally served with the army at the front, the other Boy Scouts stationed in the rear in this city have been assigned to the interior to continue their work. It is reported that another group of fifty people from the team, led by captains Chen Langzhong and He Qin, left for the capital yesterday to organize an office in Beijing to engage in a certain task. It is also learned that the headquarters of the second district branch (i.e., the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scouts) has moved to Suzhou for business.</p>
<p>The Datong Musical Society on Songshan Road in this city has always been committed to organizing Chinese music. Since the start of the all-out war of resistance, it has spared no effort in its rescue work. It has convened all members, broadcasted three times at the Sino-Western Radio Station, raised donations, comforted wounded soldiers, and provided relief to refugees. It has also gone to various military hospitals to play music to comfort them. Recently, it has been raising funds to hold a concert, and plans to use all the proceeds to support fellow countrymen who have been victimized. It is currently actively underway and will be held in the shortest possible time. It is heard that the association plans to recruit new members in order to expand the rescue work. Anyone who has a considerable level of national music and is interested in rescue work is very welcome by the association.</p>
<p>The Scout Department of the Municipal Federation is recruiting thirty comrades. Those who are interested should sign up at the Zhenhuan Boy Scout Headquarters at the intersection of Lao Chongqing Road and Dagu Road. The first wartime service team of the Chinese Boy Scouts in this city, with the arrival of late autumn, the refugees have no clothes to keep warm, and the difficult situation is difficult to describe. Therefore, it plans to hold a large-scale cold clothing campaign on a fixed date and is currently actively preparing. In addition, the team plans to send personnel to the north to comfort the soldiers fighting in North China and is currently raising comfort items.</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society rescue team set off for the front line with stretcher teams last night. Amidst the fierce artillery fire along the banks of Suzhou Creek, they rescued six wounded soldiers and sent them to the society's third hospital for treatment. It is also heard that the Southeast Office of the Society has now received a report from the Jiangyin branch that the area has been subjected to frequent air raids in recent weeks, with as many as three to five air raid alarms every day. The Society has ordered rescue teams to patrol separately and make every effort to provide rescue at any time. In addition, the Hangzhou branch accommodated 1,107 refugees and treated 81 wounded civilians in mid-October.</p>
<p>Xu Kaijin, Jin Jian, Xu Gonglu, and others from the Chinese Medical Circle's Rescue Association continued to bring comfort bags filled with sweets and supplies to the 14th Rescue Hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers. They were greeted and guided by personnel from the hospital, and the generals and soldiers were greatly encouraged.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Brussels Conference and the International Situation</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Peace in the Far East does not depend on the abstract articles of the Nine-Power Treaty, but on the thorough awareness of the peaceful countries. This is the understanding we should have of the Brussels Conference.</p>
<p>Based on this understanding, we believe that there are some aspects of the international situation expressed at the Brussels Conference that are optimistic.</p>
<p>First, the United Kingdom and the United States, which are in a leading position at this conference, have expressed close cooperation. British Foreign Secretary Eden solemnly stated that he is willing to do his best to assume the moral obligations stipulated in the treaty, and will not slacken even if Japan does not participate. We have always known that the Anglo-Saxon nation is full of chivalrous spirit. It is hoped that after the two major countries assume their moral obligations, they will be able to act bravely.</p>
<p>Second, the Soviet Union and France have been more proactive at the conference than the United Kingdom and the United States. French Foreign Minister Delbos said, "If we do not find a way to stop the massacre in the Far East, then we are simply accomplices." Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov advocated that the conference should put forward various proposals in order to restore the peaceful situation and punish the aggressor to warn others. These expressions are obviously intended to promote the situation of collective security.</p>
<p>Third, our country's representative, Ambassador Gu Weijun, said in a speech at the conference, "If Japan's aggression does not stop for a day, China will continue to resist for a day. Only peace based on Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty can be accepted by China." This solemn expression is enough to break the various illusions of those who shield the aggressor.</p>
<p>Fourth, Japan resolutely refused to participate in the conference and will sign an anti-communist agreement with Italy. This stubborn attitude makes the peaceful countries even more disheartened and easily aware of the necessity of collective security.</p>
<p>In short, the task of the Brussels Conference itself will not be more advanced than mediation or moral sanctions. However, as a transitional form in the development of the international situation, it is not necessarily disappointing. According to news from Brussels, if the conference fails, it will be handed over to the League of Nations for handling. We seem to feel that the night is long and there are many dreams. In fact, the development of the League of Nations situation is closely related to our country's efforts in the war of resistance. As long as our efforts do not slacken, the favorable international situation will always unfold step by step.</p>

<h3>Business Community Continues to Raise Over One Million Yuan in National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Women's Group's Performance Exceeds Target, Various Groups Begin to Intensify Fundraising</p>

<p>The women's group raising national salvation bonds has exceeded the predetermined number due to the efforts of the various team leaders. In order to continue to work hard and actively carry out fundraising activities, it is scheduled to hold the fifth team leader conversation meeting and the ninth group affairs meeting at 3 pm today at the Municipal Government Reception Office, hosted by the wives of the three directors Kong, Song, and Yu.</p>
<p>Hubei Branch</p>
<p>The National Salvation Bond Fundraising Association received a telegram yesterday from He Chengchong, director of the Hubei Provincial Branch, stating that Zhang Yunxuan and Xie Bangde, two merchants, had each purchased 10,000 yuan of bonds, and the funds had been paid in full and remitted. It should be requested to award them separately in accordance with the incentive regulations to inspire others. The association immediately replied with praise and has submitted the case to the National Government for awards.</p>
<p>Shaoxing Fellow Townsmen</p>
<p>The Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association issued a notice to all fellow townsmen in Shanghai to raise national salvation bonds, saying, "Since the outbreak of the war against the violent Japanese, the army has pressed on Shenzhou. The government has launched a full-scale war for national survival and issued national salvation bonds to prepare for a long-term resistance. The people in the rear should do their best to purchase bonds. Saving money is to save the country, and saving the country is to save oneself. There are no less than hundreds of thousands of fellow townsmen from the seven counties of Shaoxing living in Shanghai. Their patriotism has never lagged behind. Seeing the enemy's flames raging fiercely, they should destroy their homes to relieve the national crisis. The association has approved the letter from the Shanghai National Salvation Bond Fundraising Association, organized fundraising teams, and held repeated meetings to discuss the implementation methods. It is generally believed that this matter is of great importance, and unless all fellow townsmen in Shanghai are mobilized, the great perseverance of the seven counties of Shaoxing cannot be expressed. It is scheduled to hold a meeting at 3 pm on November 7 (Sunday) on the third floor of the Zhongyi Trust Company on Beijing Road to discuss everything. In addition to the letter, all fellow townsmen are requested to participate automatically, actively purchase bonds, and the survival of the country really depends on it."</p>
<p>Special Second District Group</p>
<p>The special second district group of the Shanghai citizens' national salvation bond fundraising team has raised nearly 100,000 yuan since the start of fundraising. The team specially sent letters to the team leaders and deputy team leaders yesterday, asking them to intensify their efforts. The original letter said, "Dear Sirs, since this group started raising national salvation bonds, we are honored to have you serve as team leader (deputy team leader) and thank you for your enthusiastic fundraising, which shows your deep concern for saving the country. However, the fundraising results have not yet reached our predetermined target. We dare to write to you to continue to intensify fundraising and report the results to this group at any time so that they can be announced. With best regards, Director Jin Tingsun."</p>
<h3>Sichuan Ship Fire Fortunately Averted</h3>

<p>The Taikoo Company's Sichuan ship, which had previously been imported from Hong Kong to Shanghai, was berthed at the company's pier on the Bund of the French Concession. At 11 am yesterday, while unloading cargo, a box of medicines suddenly emitted thick smoke and caught fire for some unknown reason. The ship used its own fire hydrant to try its best to rescue it and was extinguished immediately, fortunately averting a disaster.</p>
<h3>Dancers Patriotic and Not Behind Others</h3>
<p>Organize National Salvation Association, Publish Letter to Sisters</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dancers' National Salvation Association held its founding meeting yesterday (the 4th), with Lu Lijuan of Daxin Lu as chairman. Yin Meifeng, Yu Xiuying, Zhou Huaying, Shao Xiaomi, Xue Meili, Luo Guifang, and others were elected as persons in charge of various departments, and the following resolutions were passed: ㊀ Internally train cadres and educate the masses at the conference ㊁ Actively carry out fundraising for national salvation funds and expand publicity to promote the industry to rise up in unison. In addition, the initiators of the association, Lu Lijuan, Yin Meifeng, Ni Wenxian, Zhou Huaying, Yu Xiuying, Zhang Meimei, Chen Xueyun, Chen Feifei, Chen Lizhen, and others issued a letter to their sisters from the Shanghai Dancers' National Salvation Association yesterday, saying, "Dear sisters, we have been despised by society for a long time. We often think of being upright people, but for the sake of life, we can only be trapped in this drunken, dreamlike, and turbulent circle that exchanges the laughter of youth for food. Dear sisters, now our great and sacred war of resistance has been launched, but we are still living in this vortex of painful life, only bowing our heads and shedding tears. We believe that everyone feels this way. We are also Chinese people, and we have also seen that compatriots from all walks of life in the motherland have launched vast mass organizations in order to fight for our freedom and equality. But dear sisters, let's think about ourselves. Are we willing to wait quietly to be slaves? Sisters, we dare to say on behalf of everyone that no one wants to do this, and we must urgently stand up and admit that we are human beings. We are a group of Chinese women who are unwilling to be slaves under the continuous invasion of Japanese imperialism. Dear sisters, since this is the case, then we simply have no time to hesitate or doubt. Let us stand up and be upright people, and under the leadership of the unified government, we will help do the great work within our capabilities. Dear sisters, the enemy's artillery fire is going to burn down our domestic construction and bomb everyone's life. Many of our sisters' homes and relatives have long been gone. We must quickly rise up to avenge the country and our families, and we must not have the idea of ​​being irrelevant and watching the show. We should use all means to help the loyal and brave soldiers fighting on the front lines, drive the enemy out of our territory, and complete our glorious task of upholding human justice and fighting for national freedom and liberation. Dear sisters, wipe away your tears and stand up!"</p>
<h3>Municipal Ambulance Committee Expands Fundraising Campaign</h3>
<p>Also Telegraphs American Red Cross to Solicit Vehicles</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ambulance Committee, in order to manage the city's wounded soldier ambulance affairs during this long-term war of resistance, cannot stop its work, but the source of donations is quite lacking. Therefore, it convened the 49th cadre meeting. Chairman Yan Fuqing (Xu Guanqun acting) decided to launch a large-scale fundraising campaign, asking the business community, entertainment industry, broadcasting industry, women's community, and youth associations to promote it together, and recommended Xu Guanqun and others to be responsible for contact. In addition, the committee decided to ask the Red Cross Society Headquarters to telegraph the American Red Cross to solicit vehicles for application, as the war zone is expanding and the transport vehicles are quite lacking.</p>
<h3>Simalu Vegetable Vendors' Enthusiasm is Commendable</h3>
<p>Donated Over One Hundred Yuan for Ambulance Fees</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Shanghai Ambulance Committee has managed the city's wounded soldier ambulance affairs. Due to the lack of funding, it has repeatedly requested generous donations from all walks of life. People from all walks of life believe that ambulance work is very important in order to seek the final victory of the war of resistance, so they have donated enthusiastically. Among them, there are many maids and rickshaw pullers who donated their hard-earned savings. Yesterday, Li and others and all the vegetable vendors in the Simalu vegetable market jointly donated 108 yuan and 95 cents in national currency, asking the Anti-Enemy Support Association to transfer it to the Ambulance Committee to cover the cost of wounded soldier ambulance. The generosity and enthusiasm of the vegetable vendors are commendable.</p>
<h3>Farewell Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition Closes Today</h3>
<p>Bidding Results Announced at 6 pm</p>
<p>The farewell calligraphy and painting exhibition for comforting soldiers has been very popular since its opening. As the exhibition is about to end, it is scheduled to close today, so the lottery has already begun yesterday to exchange for paintings. The items that have been drawn include Zhuzhi Shan's cursive script vertical axis, Zhao Ziyi's flowers, Tao Yunhuan's couplets, and hundreds of other items. In order to encourage lottery interest, the association specially selected ten famous paintings worth several hundred yuan, numbered them, and included them. Yesterday, the Chinese and Foreign Groceries Association drew Yao Yuqin's donation of Zhang Guiyan's orchids, Yu Mukui drew Yu Danhan's donation of Qian Shuhu's landscape, and Hu Qingyutang's Chen Chuxiang drew Yu Danhan's donation of Mo Yunqing's landscape. In addition to the three items drawn above, there are still seven or eight hundred designated famous paintings and other valuable calligraphy and paintings. Calligraphy and painting lottery tickets are priced at ten yuan in national currency per ticket and are still being sold at the association today. Those who have purchased lottery tickets are requested to exchange them for paintings at the association before 6 pm today. Overdue will be deemed as a waiver of rights.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Announces Refugee Statistics</h3>
<p>According to the report of the Public Works Department's Health Office, there were 129 refugee shelters inspected by the office on the 3rd of this month, accommodating a total of 67,489 refugees. On the 3rd, 402 refugees were vaccinated and 534 were inoculated.</p>
<h3>Dongsheng Farm Works Hard to Plan Refugee Resettlement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Qinsheng Farm, in view of the increasing number of refugees everywhere and out of deep sympathy, has decided to first develop more than 27,000 mu of land in Jiashan, Anhui, Fuyang, Zhejiang, Kunshan, Jiangsu, and other places as a place for refugees to migrate and cultivate, so as to achieve the effect of long-term war of resistance. It is now instructed by the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Construction Department to allow local county governments to organize the Greater China Rural Production and Cultivation Society. Yesterday, the initiators Sun Juren, Yu Qiru, and others discussed ways to raise funds and asked leaders from all walks of life for assistance. It is heard that it will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Nanhua Industry Association Thoroughly Investigates Jiufu's Sugar Imports</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency said that the Shanghai Nanhua Industry Association, based on reports that the Jiufu Nanhua store next to Cai Tongde, north of Qiu Chang Henan Road, has privately imported a large number of enemy sugars, the chairman of the committee, Cheng Zhuoping, personally went to thoroughly investigate. Zhu Qin Fan, the person in charge of Jiufu, stated that Cao Hanfang, the manager, had bid for 2,100 bags of red and white sugar from the Songhu Police and Labor Command on September 28 this year and held a certificate from the Command. As for the origin of the red and white sugar, the store replied that it did not know.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Publicly Announces Owners to Supply Water North of Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Notify Company to Supply as Usual, Charge Water Fees for Mutual Benefit</p>
<p>The Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association issued a public announcement yesterday regarding the water supply for residents north of Suzhou Creek, saying, "To all Shanghai owners, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, all citizens north of Suzhou Creek, east from Henan Road, west to Xizang Road, and north to the boundary road, have moved away. Those who remain are poor and suffering compatriots. For two months, they have been living dangerously. Recently, it has been heard that owners in the area have requested the water company to shut off the water supply, which is too inhumane. It is hoped that all Shanghai owners will uphold the purpose of helping each other in times of difficulty, notify the water company to supply water as usual, and charge water fees to the residents to achieve mutual benefit. In the face of national crisis, we must help each other. It is hoped."</p>
<h3>The Mission of a Private Tutor</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle on August 13th, most schools in and near the war zone have been forced to suspend operations. Young students, despite their eagerness to learn, are struggling to find opportunities. Educators, harboring a grand desire to serve, are troubled by the lack of places to teach. In light of this, the China Special Education Association, aiming to experiment with special education during this extraordinary period and meet societal needs, organized the Private Tutor Service to accomplish a specific mission. Since its inception over a month ago, 700 teachers have registered, more than 60 families have requested tutors, 41 locations have been used for lessons, 51 teachers have served, and 136 students have been taught. Although the current achievements have not yet reached our ideal level of perfection, they are sufficient to encourage us to continue experimenting. The full development of this work is currently hampered by a lack of understanding among the general public. However, this is not a cause for concern. Once proven successful, it will undoubtedly receive enthusiastic public trust, and the future will certainly bring satisfactory results.</p>
<p>The Private Tutor Service is an important institution for experimenting with new education during this extraordinary period. The significance of the mission undertaken by its teachers is evident. It is particularly important to have a deep understanding and practical implementation of the following three major missions:</p>
<p>㊀ Experimenting with Individualized Education: Since the implementation of the new education system in our country, general formalists have focused only on appearances and emphasized form over substance. They sought only grand school buildings and exquisite equipment, which can certainly achieve aesthetic appeal on the surface, but may not necessarily fulfill the entire mission of education. The true value of education lies in mental training. Each student has their own strengths and weaknesses in personality, character, and morality. How to correct their weaknesses and develop their strengths is the most important task of mental training. Formalists do not have the time for this. Under the class system of education, attention is only paid to commonalities, and little consideration is given to individuality. It seems difficult for a teacher to understand the individual characteristics of dozens or hundreds of students. Students' accomplishments and preferences vary greatly due to differences in personality. Teachers, in their haste to teach, often fail to fully understand this. Ignoring the individuality of students and only providing general education is an unavoidable shortcoming of the current education system. In this extraordinary period, schools have suffered, so the shortcomings of past class teaching methods may be solved through other means. The private tutor system is not solely created to solve teacher unemployment or to avoid student difficulties. Its true effectiveness lies in experimenting with individual-based education, enriching individual-based intelligence, and correcting individual-based defects, in order to remedy the shortcomings of class education. The key to its success or failure lies in whether the teacher can take on this mission. Therefore, excellent teaching and adaptation to individuality are essential and unforgettable guidelines. Confucius, the great educator of our country, had his own stance in his educational philosophy, and thus became a teacher for all generations. In the "Analects," the discussion of "benevolence" appears over a hundred times, and no two answers are the same. This is not because the definition of "benevolence" can be changed at any time, but because it is adapted to the individuality of the students asking the questions. As a result, students are eventually influenced, reform their habits, and become virtuous gentlemen. Today's school education often emphasizes form, gradually forming a dictionary-style education, while individual education is a living education, that is, the education of the teacher, and not a dictionary-style education. Therefore, the teachers of the Private Tutor Service should take on this mission, believing that this is the beginning of a major experiment in education, and promote the discovery of new facts and new theories. Those with an experimental spirit should not be concerned with the success or failure of the matter.</p>
<p>㊁ Promoting Mass Organization: The establishment of the Private Tutor Service is taking place during an extraordinary period. Therefore, in addition to the mission of teaching, teachers have a mission to the nation and the country during this extraordinary period, which is to take responsibility for organizing the masses. Recently, some commentators have often criticized the current lack of organization. Recalling the September 18th Incident, some international observers also criticized our country as being unorganized. We have strongly defended ourselves. Based on the facts, China is not unorganized, but the mass organization may not be very sound. Therefore, teachers should take on the mission of promoting mass organization and improving mass organization. Private tutors have their own families, and those they serve are the families of students. Therefore, in addition to teaching, with harmonious emotions, they can naturally transform families from unorganized to organized, and further improve already organized families into more sound organizations. This is the duty that teachers should fulfill during this extraordinary period. Anyone with enthusiasm and perseverance will be able to accomplish this mission, encouraging people to fulfill their responsibilities to the nation and the country.</p>
<p>㊂ Leading the Masses by Example: If the teacher himself is not perfect, he is not qualified to teach, and even less qualified to guide. Learners imitate, and teachers set examples. If teachers cannot lead by example, learners have nothing to imitate and find it difficult to take them as role models. As for teachers, they should have elegant movements to serve as models, just as a band has a good leader who can then conduct the tempo to guide the music through its ups and downs. Therefore, leaders must first have movements, so that learners can have something to follow. Teachers are like the engine of a factory, and the rotation of the gears depends on the engine. Therefore, if the behavior of teachers cannot serve as a model, students will lose their example, and the masses will have nothing to admire. Therefore, teachers should strive to fulfill their duties to the nation and the country, and when they raise their voices, people will respond enthusiastically, and the future of the nation and the country depends on it. If teachers want to lead students, they must start with themselves, abide by regulations, be punctual, and establish credibility. These are essential conditions. Although things are ordinary and trivial, they are also important for establishing a reputation. It must be understood that even the most ordinary things can become the most valuable if space and time are properly coordinated. The ancients said, "To travel far, you must start from nearby; to climb high, you must start from below," meaning that everything must start from oneself and start from small things. May we always grasp this correct perspective.</p>
<p>I regret that I could not participate in the first parent-teacher get-together due to my departure to comfort wounded soldiers on National Day. Today, I am very pleased to meet with you and make the above report. What I would like to add here is that students taught by teachers in our service who pass the final examination at the end of the semester will have their academic status recognized by the Social Affairs Bureau, and they will be specially allowed to transfer schools in the next semester. I sincerely hope that my colleagues and teachers in this service will intensify their work and work together.</p>

<h3>Those Who Advocate for Peace are Traitors</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xianwen</p>
<p>Recently, in various publications dedicated to saving the nation, we have seen large-print headlines that read, "Those who advocate for peace are traitors"; and on the streets of certain special zones, we can find red slogans that declare, "Those who advocate for peace are traitors." The dissemination of these headlines and slogans has led the general public to believe that, even today, there are still some individuals who are "advocating for peace," which comes as a surprising revelation. But is this "smoke without fire"? There is no need for astonishment. First, since the Japanese army's occupation of Zhabei, while continuing their offensive, they have also been releasing messages of peace from various angles, and rumors even suggest that some individuals have emerged to "mediate." Second, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Brussels is currently in session, with representatives of various nations repeatedly calling for the mediation of the Sino-Japanese War and the restoration of peace in the Far East. Of course, some Chinese, witnessing the retreat of the national army on both northern and southern battlefields and the indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft across the country, fear excessive sacrifice and intend to "retreat in good time." These three factors have contributed to the recent atmosphere of peace and have given rise to headlines or slogans such as "Those who advocate for peace are traitors."</p>
<p>Of course, if we interpret the title or slogan "Those who advocate for peace are traitors" literally, it is somewhat flawed. This is not only because China is a weak nation in urgent need of peace; even if China were a strong nation, it would still deeply cherish peace and would be unwilling to lightly engage in war with foreign countries. Therefore, the current Sino-Japanese War, from any perspective, is a great misfortune for human society and is not what the Chinese people desire. If the war could be stopped and peace could be achieved, would it not be a joyous occasion? Thus, to call "those who advocate for peace" traitors seems to be a harsh judgment. However, we must understand that this war of resistance is a last resort. We have endured the enemy's aggression time and again. We should have resisted during the September 18th Incident, we should have resisted during the January 28th Incident, we should have resisted when Chahar fell, and we should have resisted when the East Hebei Autonomous Anti-Communist Council was established. In the end, we endured it all, but the more we endured, the more aggressive the enemy became. Unable to endure any longer, we began to resist at the cost of sacrifice. If we can now achieve peace without war, we would gladly welcome it, but it must restore our sovereignty and return our territory. Otherwise, it is not advocating for peace but advocating for surrender. If someone emerges today to advocate for surrender, is this not treason? This is why we call "those who advocate for peace" traitors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, let us analyze the source of the recent atmosphere of peace.</p>
<p>First, is the peace message released by the enemy reliable? This is a question. If the enemy has ulterior motives and intends to disrupt our military and popular morale, we should guard against it even more carefully. How can we rashly echo it? Taking a step back, even if the enemy genuinely wants to cease hostilities, whether the scope of the cessation includes both northern and southern battlefields or is limited to Shanghai alone is also a question. Everyone knows that the heart of this Sino-Japanese War lies not in Shanghai but in North China. If the enemy stops at Shanghai but continues to advance in North China, this is merely the enemy's "wishful thinking," violating our spirit of "total resistance." How can we fall for such peace? Taking another step back, even if the enemy genuinely wants a complete ceasefire, the terms of the ceasefire are still a question. Currently, the enemy has not suffered significant losses in military terms. To say that their ceasefire terms will not be more stringent than those proposed during the Marco Polo Bridge Incident is a naive fantasy. Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident was the final moment when our country decided to resist, and since our country has sacrificed countless lives and properties to defend this final moment, how can we accept conditions that exceed this final moment in the middle of this war of resistance? Therefore, even if the enemy wants peace, it is factually impossible, let alone the fact that the enemy may not genuinely seek peace.</p>
<p>Second, although the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Brussels has declared its intention to mediate the Sino-Japanese War, whether the countries participating in the conference have any consideration of sanctions beyond mediation is another question. We know that the Nine-Power Treaty does not contain any provisions for sanctions against aggressor nations. Therefore, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can only advocate for mediation and cannot conveniently propose sanctions. Because of this, we cannot help but believe that the countries participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference only want to mediate and have no consideration of sanctions against Japan. In fact, even if the world's nations are determined to sanction Japan, they would still have to go through a process of mediation in terms of procedure. If we believe that the countries participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, because they are currently declaring their intention to mediate, will limit their future actions to mediation, thereby sparking the motive for peace, it is a major mistake. Moreover, resistance is our own affair. We certainly hope for foreign assistance, but we cannot agree to peace simply because foreign nations want us to. Furthermore, the declaration of mediation by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is insufficient to prove that the countries have no intention of further sanctioning Japan.</p>
<p>Third, as for the fact that the lives and properties of the people have suffered greatly due to the war of resistance, it was an expected phenomenon. For a weak nation like China to initially suffer minor military setbacks against a strong nation like Japan is an inevitable reality. Otherwise, we would not have needed to call for a long-term war of resistance, and we could have fought a "quick battle" with Japan. Even in the case of the Shanghai battle, our ability to defend Zhabei and Jiangwan for more than two months before safely retreating is a military victory rather than a military failure. From now on, we can openly acknowledge that there will be a day when Nanshi will also be evacuated, and even that the capital may fall. All of this is a process that we should have recognized and already recognized at the start of the war of resistance. If we did not have such an understanding, we should have long ago "knelt" to the enemy and become their slaves, and we should not have launched this war of resistance. We launched this war of resistance to achieve ultimate victory through sustained sacrifice. Moreover, we have full confidence in victory. Therefore, if someone advocates for "retreating in good time" today because they fear the current sacrifices, they have completely failed to understand the meaning of China's war of resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that there is no sufficient reason for the recent atmosphere of peace. We firmly believe that the government will resolutely resist to the end and will not be swayed by the outside atmosphere of peace in the slightest. However, if someone rashly advocates for peace based on these sources that lack sufficient reason, it must be recognized that it has the negative consequences of disrupting military and popular morale. At a time when soldiers on the front lines are fighting heroically and the people in the rear are striving to provide support, it is nothing short of treason to disrupt military and popular morale. This is why we call "those who advocate for peace" traitors.</p>
<p>"Those who advocate for peace are traitors" is indeed flawed and seems to be a harsh judgment, but in the current environment, advocating for peace is either a disguised name for surrender or carries the risk of disrupting military and popular morale, at the very least inadvertently aiding the actions of traitors. The Chinese people after the outbreak of the war of resistance should all deeply remember: we only have one way out! Resist to the end! Strive for ultimate victory.</p>
<h3>Trade is Sluggish after the War, Customs Revenue Slightly Reduced</h3>
<p>Transit Tax Revenue Last Month Totaled 600,000</p>
<p>Import and export trade is sluggish after the war, and customs revenue has been significantly affected. According to Qiu Zhuoqi, the Deputy Commissioner of Customs, import and export taxes for the past three months have decreased compared to before. However, Shanghai's industries and businesses were quite prosperous this year, and the tax revenue for each month before the war was significantly higher than the same period last year. Therefore, the average tax revenue for this year will not be significantly reduced. In addition, the city's transit tax has been very successful since it was ordered to be collected. Last month, it totaled about 600,000 yuan. Recently, it has been slightly affected due to the poor transportation on the Suzhou Creek, but it is expected to improve soon.</p>
<h3>Wartime Prices Fluctuate</h3>
<p>Fuel Prices Increase the Most, Food Prices Second, Clothing Prices Decrease Compared to Normal</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, grain prices soared. A reporter from the Shishi News Agency specially consulted the National Tariff Commission yesterday and recorded the recent four-month consumer price index as follows: (Food Category) July 106.0, August 128.5, September 141.4, October 126.9; (Clothing Category) July 107.0, August 106.4, September 106.4, October 105.8; (Rent Category) July 109.4, August 109.4, September 107.4, October 109.4; (Fuel Category) July 129.9, August 150.5, September 178.9, October 173.7; (Miscellaneous Category) July 1612.4, August 166.2, September 184.1, October 16.1; (Overall Index) July 1.120.0, August 134.6, September 147.7, October 139.5. From the above statistical figures, it is evident that the prices of fuel, such as coal and coal briquettes, have increased the most drastically. The prices of food, such as rice and grains, have been effectively regulated by the People's Food Regulation Association. Therefore, although prices increased at the beginning of the war, they quickly fell back. The prices of clothing have decreased because people have been economically strained by the war and have saved on clothing expenses.</p>
<h3>Relief Goods</h3>
<p>Hoping for a Steady Stream of Donations, Especially Cold-Weather Supplies</p>
<p>Soldiers on the front lines urgently need cold-weather supplies, such as cotton quilts and cotton vests. It is hoped that all sectors will donate more. The collection point for cotton vests is the Silk Crepe Industry Association on Beijing Road, East Shilu. For new styles and sizes of cotton vests, please inquire at the Comfort Mission and the Local Association in the Zhonghui Building or the main branch of the Sino-Western Pharmacy. It is still hoped that all sectors will donate first-aid kits, sanitary shirts and pants, bicycles, etc., in a steady stream.</p>
<p>Since the Municipal First Special Zone Citizens' Federation's Comfort the Anti-Enemy Soldiers Committee expanded its campaign to collect relief goods, people from all walks of life have been donating daily. Yesterday, Guangming Elementary School, through the fundraising efforts of Ms. Hua Hongquan, donated 1,000 first-aid kits; the brokers' association of the Huashang Gauze Exchange donated 1,000 pairs of cloth shoes; and Guangrongtai Hardware Store donated 96 cotton vests and 501 first-aid kits. The committee, recognizing the urgent need for towels, sugar porcelain cups, down hats, and gloves on the front lines, urgently hopes that all sectors will donate generously. The current office is located at 77 Paomating Road, telephone 96658.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Industry Fundraising Broadcast Continues</h3>
<p>Enthusiastic Donations, Extended for Two Days</p>
<p>The Shanghai Entertainment Industry Salvation Association and the Relief Association have been extensively raising relief funds through broadcasting from November 1st to 5th. The results have been very good, with enthusiastic donations. As of the 4th, there were already 7,000 to 8,000 yuan, as well as a large number of antiques, jewelry, and jade, which will be auctioned on the radio. It is learned that the association and others, considering the effectiveness of this fundraising effort, have specially consulted with the Broadcasting Industry Association and will extend the broadcast for two more days, the 6th and 7th, so that the antiques, jewelry, and jade can be auctioned off completely, and the proceeds will be donated.</p>
<h3>The Fire at the Four-Banks Warehouse Spread to Businesses</h3>
<p>The Xiechangde Store Was Completely Destroyed, Smoke and Flames Were Still Spewing Out Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Four-Banks Warehouse, where the brave soldiers of the Xie Tuan Yang Camp once heroically defended Zhabei, and the Continental Warehouse to the east, have been set on fire by the enemy army. The remaining fire finally extinguished yesterday morning. The eastern neighbor of the Continental Warehouse, located on the riverside at the western end of the north bank of the New Garbage Bridge, is a three-story shikumen building with the store name Xiechangde. The flames from the Continental Warehouse also spread to this building, which has been completely destroyed. However, smoke and flames were still spewing out yesterday morning. To the east of this store, it is close to the concession. All the city houses were preserved because the concession fire trucks were stationed in advance to protect them, and the fire did not spread.</p>
<h3>Requesting the Court to Temporarily Suspend the Acceptance of Rent Arrears Lawsuits</h3>
<p>The Municipal First Special Zone Citizens' Federation's 35th District Branch believes that since the outbreak of the war in this city, in the war zone, residents have been evacuated, and city streets have been devastated. In the two special zones, they are often affected by stray bullets, financial difficulties, and economic depression. Although stores on all roads are open for business, business is sluggish. Households are also suffering from pay cuts or unemployment, and their livelihoods are unsustainable. However, landlords are pressing for rent arrears lawsuits, which is extremely urgent. Seizures and evictions are still being heard. It is not conducive to supporting the long-term war of resistance and maintaining the hardships together. Therefore, an emergency executive committee meeting was convened yesterday to discuss everything. The following resolutions were made: ㊀ Send a letter to the Municipal Federation to forward a letter to the court, requesting that during this extraordinary period, the acceptance of rent arrears lawsuits be temporarily suspended. ㊁ Submit a request to the party and government organs that during this extraordinary period, a Rent Dispute Resolution Committee be jointly organized by all sectors. ㊂ Submit a request to the authorities to issue a Rent Payment Law after the war. ㊃ Send a letter to the Municipal Federation and the Real Estate Association to negotiate a fair method for rent collection and payment. ㊄ The above points should be advocated by all public organizations.</p>
<h3>The Songjiang Red Branch Continues its Efforts</h3>
<p>Since Songjiang was heavily bombed by enemy aircraft on the 28th, 29th, and 30th of last month, and the 2nd and 4th of this month, the city streets have been devastated, and there have been many deaths and injuries. The Songjiang Red Branch's rescue team has been working tirelessly for days, regardless of danger, to carry out rescue work. On the 2nd of this month, the Red Branch was also bombed, but it has not retreated from the rescue work in the slightest, and is still making progress. Today, the association held an emergency meeting, noting that the various rescue hospitals in Songjiang have been virtually shut down due to repeated heavy bombing by enemy aircraft. It was decided to quickly establish a Songjiang Rescue Hospital to continue carrying out rescue work for wounded soldiers and civilians.</p>
<h3>Chinese Employees of the New Taikoo Ship Donate Medicines and Food</h3>
<p>All the Chinese employees of the New Taikoo Shipping Company have recently donated medicines and food to the Pudong Tenth Rescue Team of the Red Cross, one after another. The first donation included two taels of gray iodine, four cans of Ictodo, ten bottles of Shuangyang Water, 25 grams of Riuanol, 20 pounds of biscuits, three dozen bottles of milk, and three dozen cans of food. The second donation included a total of 448 pieces of various Western medicines. The enthusiasm of these Chinese employees is commendable.</p>

<h3>Representatives at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference Strive to Mediate the Far East Dispute</h3>
<p>Decide to organize a subcommittee to carry out work. Draft a petition to invite Japan to participate again. Italy's obvious partiality towards Japan advocates direct negotiations between China and Japan.</p>
<p>Beijing: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference held a closed-door meeting at 2:30 PM today, which lasted until 4:15 PM. According to responsible sources, the representatives of the various countries, after discussion, unanimously agreed to issue a petition to the Japanese government, as proposed by the American representative, in response to Japan's note refusing to participate in the conference, and declared their willingness to mediate between China and Japan. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is scheduled to continue its meeting at 10:30 AM tomorrow and will issue a public statement tomorrow at noon explaining the results of the meeting. The following is a recap of today's meeting: At the opening of the meeting today, Chairman Sparks, the Belgian Foreign Minister, declared that Japan had not announced the abrogation of the Nine-Power Treaty, which shows that there is still room for compromise. American representative Davis then spoke, advocating that another petition be sent to the Japanese government, urging it to adopt a compromising attitude. British Foreign Secretary Eden immediately seconded the proposal. French Foreign Minister Delbos, in addition to expressing his agreement, also proposed the formation of a subcommittee to draft the petition and suggested mediation between China and Japan. There were no objections from the representatives of the various countries regarding this point. Only Italian representative Count Machidi opposed granting broad powers to the subcommittee, believing that negotiations should be conducted directly between China and Japan. French Foreign Minister Delbos immediately refuted this, stating that ❶ the countries concerned all have an obligation to safeguard their interests in the Far East, and ❷ if these countries were to intervene in the Far East dispute, it would be in accordance with Articles 7 and 8 of the Nine-Power Treaty. As a result, Italian representative Machidi did not insist and accepted the granting of broad powers to the subcommittee. At this point, the representatives of the various countries further discussed the organization of the subcommittee. According to informed sources, there were two proposals at the time: ❶ The subcommittee would be composed of seven countries: Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, and the Netherlands. ❷ The subcommittee would be composed of only three countries: Britain, the United States, and Belgium. However, France and Italy both have significant interests in the Far East and are bound to demand participation in the subcommittee. Therefore, the first option is more likely to be adopted. As for the suggestion to have Britain and the United States alone contact both China and Japan, American representative Davis has already rejected it. In addition, the representatives of the various countries also discussed the drafting of the aforementioned petition. According to responsible sources, its content would refute the reasons given by Japan for refusing to participate, namely: ❶ The Japanese government stated that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was being chaired by the League of Nations, and Japan was unwilling to attend the meeting as a defendant. Regarding this point, American representative Davis declared that the United States is not a member of the League of Nations and is also sending representatives, which shows that the meeting is completely independent. ❷ The Japanese government also stated that some countries that do not have much interest in the Far East are also participating in the meeting, making its scope too broad. Regarding this point, the representatives of the various countries all stated that this argument is untenable because the participating countries do have significant interests in the Far East. People at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference believe that if the Japanese government continues to insist on its original attitude towards the subcommittee's petition, it will inevitably be placed in a delicate situation. The representatives of the various countries finally decided to adjourn the meeting until tomorrow morning. Whether they will decide to give full powers to the subcommittee to conduct negotiations with the Japanese government and then convene a full meeting after Japan submits its reply is currently unknown. French Foreign Minister Delbos is scheduled to depart tomorrow to meet with King George II of Greece. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, April)</p>
<h3>Our Delegation Issues Public Statement Refuting Japanese Statement</h3>
<p>Beijing: The Chinese delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference recently issued a public statement refuting the statement issued by the Japanese government, which was used to explain the reasons for its refusal to participate in the conference, stating that "this document not only contains many distortions of the truth about China, but also proves that Japan is clearly hostile to the efforts of the League of Nations and the United States to restore peace." Regarding the views held by the Chinese government, Representative Gu Weijun stated yesterday, "There is a limit to human endurance. Japan's acts of aggression against China have become increasingly severe. The Chinese nation is truly forced to rise up and defend itself. Even during our resistance, we deeply know that China's enemy is not the Japanese people, but the Japanese militarists." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, April 4)</p>
<h3>Italy's Far East Policy Entirely Dependent on European Situation</h3>
<p>Brussels: Chinese sources here claim that the neutral attitude of Italian representative Machidi's speech at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference yesterday was quite unexpected. It was originally thought that the Italian representative would deliver a public speech favoring Japan, but most of his wording was very moderate. According to these sources, Italy's Far East policy is often dependent on its European policy, and any slight change in its European policy will be followed by a change in its attitude towards the Far East. (National Maritime Telegraph, April 4)</p>
<p>Brussels: Political figures here seem quite surprised by the attitude of the American delegation, as it was the main initiator and is expected to make more active contributions. There is general regret over the absence of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, as it is believed that greater achievements would have been made if all countries had participated in the meeting with their foreign ministers.

<h3>International Women's League for Peace and Freedom Demands a Stop to Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>Geneva: The International Women's League for Peace and Freedom today sent a letter to the chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, former Belgian Foreign Minister Sparks, requesting that the governments of the participating countries promptly stop the Sino-Japanese war, and when necessary, immediately take systematic measures in the spiritual, economic, and financial fields to deal with the aggressor government. However, the measures adopted by the various countries to stop the war should be in accordance with the principles of Chinese sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and should not allow the aggressor to benefit instead. In other words, Japan should not be allowed to annex the territories it has invaded. The areas occupied by the Japanese army since the Lugouqiao Incident in China on July 7 of this year should be withdrawn. In addition, if a fair solution to the Sino-Japanese problem is to be established, China's sovereignty in the three northeastern provinces must be restored.

<p>It is also said that the new Italo-Japanese trade agreement, which has been under negotiation for several months and stipulates that Japan will exchange its products for raw cotton produced in Abyssinia, will also be signed at the same time. Responsible officials in Berlin deny that the Anti-Comintern Pact contains clauses opposing Soviet interference in Far Eastern affairs. It is claimed that the new pact is the same as the existing German-Japanese agreement. (Reuters dispatch, April 5, from Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>German Officials Deny Japanese Rumors</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, German officials in China have solemnly stated that the report issued by the Domei News Agency on the 1st of this month, stating that the renowned German economist and former Chancellor Dr. Luther, during a reception for journalists at the German Consulate General in Tianjin, made the following statement, saying that "Germany will cooperate closely with Japan to realize the plan to develop the economy of North China," is completely untrue. The above report is entirely a rumor fabricated by the Japanese to confuse the public. (Haitong News Agency)</p>

<h3>Destruction of Enemy's Rear Transportation Line on the Jinpu Railway</h3>
<p>Difficult Transportation for the Enemy Occupying Pingyuan and Dezhou</p>
<p>[Jinan] According to people from the front lines, there are about six to seven thousand enemy troops on the Jinpu Railway. In addition to more than two thousand regular enemy troops, the rest are a rabble of Korean puppet troops who are causing disturbances everywhere. The people hate them to the bone. The enemy occupying Pingyuan is the Futo Brigade headquarters, with just over a thousand soldiers, carrying more than ten cannons. Recently, they were reinforced with over a thousand soldiers, six cannons, and two armored vehicles. Because the railway tracks have been destroyed by us, they are often stopped at Pingyuan Station. The enemy occupying Dezhou carries thirty to forty cannons. Because the rear transportation has been severely disrupted by our guerrillas, transportation is difficult and ammunition is extremely scarce. The remaining enemy troops are scattered on both sides of the railway. (Central News Agency dispatch, April 4)</p>

<h3>Our Fresh Troops Vigorously Annihilate the River-Crossing Enemy on Three Routes, Showing Signs of Collapse</h3>
<p>No Traces of the Enemy in Yaojiazhai and Caijiazhai. The Enemy in the Eastern Part of Wujiazhai is Also Eliminated. Half of the Enemy Landing at Jinshanzui is Resolved.</p>
<p>Since being forced to cross the south bank of the Suzhou Creek near Shenjihang, the enemy has heavily reinforced their forces yesterday, reaching about two regiments, and fiercely attacked our Tingtou and Wujiazhai positions. At the same time, enemy artillery fire was concentrated on these areas. Our × Division soldiers, disregarding their own safety, charged into the enemy lines under the cover of our artillery fire, taking advantage of the enemy's unstable footing. They advanced bravely, one after another, directly into the enemy's ranks, sweeping left and right, as if entering an uninhabited land. The enemy's vanguard was completely annihilated, corpses littered the field, and the canals flowed red. The enemy, suffering a head-on defeat, fled towards Caijiazhai and Yaojiazhai, attempting to pressure us from both sides. However, our loyal and brave soldiers had anticipated this move and set up ambushes in advance. When the enemy approached, they launched a fierce attack. Seeing that their plan had failed, the enemy ran amok in the Yaojiazhai, Tingtou, Wujiazhai, and Caijiazhai line, engaging in a mixed battle with our forces. Bullets rained down, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. After about several hours, our reinforcements arrived and immediately divided into three routes to assist in the counterattack against the enemy from Yaojiazhai, Zhangzhai, and Caijiazhai. Another fierce battle unfolded again. The enemy also desperately sent reinforcements, hoping to resist stubbornly. However, our soldiers, with a determination to die, broke through the enemy's barriers several times. By about 3:00 AM this morning, the enemy, with heavy casualties, began to collapse and retreated towards Tingtou, Wujiazhai, and the north bank of the Suzhou Creek. Our troops pursued the fleeing enemy, determined to eliminate the remaining forces, and launched a siege on the enemy in Wujiazhai and Tingtou. By 7:00 AM this morning, our troops had completely annihilated the eastern half of the enemy in Wujiazhai. The remaining enemy in Tingtou has also been shaken, with most of them retreating towards the north bank. In this battle, our troops captured three light machine guns, one anti-aircraft machine gun, more than twenty Arisaka rifles, as well as countless ammunition, flags, gas masks, etc., which have been sent to the rear for display. The area from Zhoujiaqiao to Beixinjing has been heavily defended since our troops fiercely attacked and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. Yesterday, they did not dare to advance, so there was no fierce fighting. However, this morning, enemy artillery again blindly bombarded our troops, and we returned fire, maintaining a strict defense along the river. If the enemy attacks, they will definitely not succeed. Also, from the line of Xiaonanxiang north to Guangfu Shixianggong Temple and Caowang Temple, as of noon today, there have only been occasional sentry battles, and the overall situation seems relatively calm.</p>
<h3>Major Positional Battle Expected in the Western Section of the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency's correspondent accompanying the troops reported at 12:10 PM on the 5th that the battle for the strongholds in the semicircular position in the western section of the Suzhou Creek, with Yaojiazhai as its apex, has ended, and a major positional battle is about to unfold. A portion of our troops surrounded between Tingtou and Zhangzhai broke through the encirclement after a fierce battle last night and made contact with our main forces. At the same time, our troops in Tianduzhai, in coordination with a portion of our troops surrounded in Yaojiazhai, attacked the enemy forces on the Yujidun side from both inside and outside, broke through the enemy's position, and all retreated to Tianduzhai, forming a solid line of defense, strictly preventing the enemy from expanding westward. The enemy surrounded by us in Jiangjiazhai has suffered heavy casualties after repeated attacks and defenses by us. Half of it has been recovered, and the remaining forces will not be difficult to eliminate.</p>
<h3>Four Stealthy Crossings at Chenjiadu</h3>
<p>At Chenjiadu, the enemy forces released smoke screens and stealthily crossed the river four times last night at 10:00 PM, 1:00 AM, 2:30 AM, and 4:00 AM to reinforce the remaining enemy troops in Liujiazhai on the south bank. However, our troops were heavily guarded and repelled them each time before they could gain a foothold. The enemy had erected three pontoon bridges there, two of which were destroyed by our artillery fire. As for the remaining enemy forces hiding in foreign houses, more than forty were annihilated by us yesterday.</p>
<h3>Our Troops and the Enemy Confront Each Other at Zhujiabang</h3>
<p>The enemy who attacked our Baziqiao last night was repelled by our brave resistance and several hand-to-hand combats until midnight. The enemy then constructed fortifications in Caijiazhai and an unnamed small village to its west, confronting us across Zhujiabang. After six days of bloody battles and multiple stealthy crossings, the enemy finally gained a foothold of about one kilometer in diameter on the south bank. Today, enemy artillery fire again concentrated on bombarding the area from west of Beixinjing to Qujiaqiao. In order to prevent the enemy's momentum from spreading, our troops also concentrated their firepower to launch a counterattack, with a deadline to eliminate the enemy.</p>
<h3>Two Enemy Regiments Attack Jiangqiao Town</h3>
<p>We Cut Off the Enemy's Communication Line</p>
<p>The Central News Agency's correspondent accompanying the troops reported at 12:15 PM on the 5th that at 2:00 AM this morning, about two enemy regiments attacked our forward defense position in Jiangqiao Town from Gejiaxiang. Their left wing attacked our Jishen Temple, and their right wing attacked our Lijiaxiang from Quanchi. Our troops calmly responded to the battle, taking offensive measures during the defense. They dispatched a portion of their forces to counterattack along Xiaohan from Lijiaxiang, implementing a central breakthrough and cutting off the enemy's communication line. The enemy's left-wing forces, threatened by us, retreated backward. Our troops pursued and launched a fierce attack on Quanchi. As of the time of the report, the fighting was still ongoing.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Pudong Remains Relaxed</h3>
<p>Our Troops Have Strong Forces and Strict Defenses, Making it Difficult for the Enemy to Succeed. Enemy Planes Bombed Pudong Yesterday, Killing and Injuring Many People</p>
<p>The situation in Pudong remains relaxed. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, enemy ships in the Huangpu River fired nineteen cannons in succession, but there was no movement at night. Only sporadic machine gun fire could be heard from the ships of the Qichang Wharf on the Huangpu River, but there were no other actions. The general public is quite concerned about the situation in Pudong. In fact, Pudong has strong forces and strict defenses, making it difficult for any enemy attempt to succeed.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, enemy planes dropped many bombs in various villages in Pudong. This morning, it was found that one bomb dropped in Zhangjiawan destroyed a civilian house at No. 23, killing a resident named Gu Er'a. One bomb dropped in the fields behind the Qinci Yangdian injured three men and women, Jiangbei residents Wang Wuxiao, Wang Yinghua, and Wang Zhoushi, and destroyed four hundred thatched sheds. In addition, a building built by the French merchant Yongxing Huayi Company in Lujiazui collapsed after being bombed, injuring three residents, Wang Jingen, Zhang Guitong, and Yin Dianming.</p>
<h3>Enemy Landed Outside Jinshanzui</h3>
<p>About One Hundred, Half of Whom Have Been Eliminated</p>
<p>The Central News Agency's correspondent accompanying the troops reported at 12:10 PM on the afternoon of the 5th that several enemy ships anchored outside Hangzhou Bay. At dawn today, several small boats suddenly carried about one hundred enemy soldiers and secretly landed there. Our troops were prepared and launched a brave attack. As of the time of the report, half of them had been eliminated, and the remaining half would not be difficult to resolve. At the same time, several enemy planes dropped bombs in the vicinity, but our losses were minimal.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Reconnoiter Nanshi Again</h3>
<p>French Flags on Church Roofs Are Conspicuous Everywhere. French Military Authorities Dispatch Troops to Protect Water and Electricity Plants.</p>
<p>At around 9:00 AM today (the 5th), three enemy giant planes circled and reconnoitered over Nanshi before leaving at around 10:00 AM without dropping any bombs.</p>
<p>Since the enemy threatened to bomb Nanshi, the churches have filed protests. At the same time, the churches have been covering their roofs with French flags for days. The Catholic Church has many properties in Nanshi, so the church has requested the French consulate to issue large flags to be hung on the roofs. Therefore, the French tricolor flags are conspicuously flying over Nanshi.</p>
<p>The water and electricity in Nanshi are under the control of the Shanghai Waterworks, which is located outside the Bansongyuan Road Bund in southern Shanghai. Therefore, the concession authorities, for protection, have a small warship anchored in front of the Qiuxin Factory. Since the enemy threatened to bomb, the French military authorities have dispatched more than five hundred troops to protect the Huangpu River side of Bansongyuan Road, so the waterworks can be safe. The electricity company is also safe because of its connection. However, the electricity company has completely removed the street lights along the roads in Nanshi.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Transported Tank Vehicles Again</h3>
<p>Last night (the 4th), two transport ships converted from enemy merchant ships, No. 135 and another unidentified ship, sailed to Shanghai and docked at the Qiujiang Wharf, unloading more than one hundred military trucks and more than twenty tank vehicles. The enemy ship Changqi Maru, which sailed to Shanghai the other day, carried not only a large amount of ammunition but also five hundred engineers specializing in cleaning firearms.</p>
<h3>Tracks of the Songhu Railway Were Stolen and Dismantled by the Enemy</h3>
<p>According to reliable information, the tracks of the Songhu Railway have been stolen and completely dismantled by the enemy, and the rails have been moved to build enemy fortifications. According to investigations, this road was the first railway in our country, starting from Binshan Road in this city to Wusong, about twenty or so li long. Construction began in October of the 23rd year of Guangxu and opened to traffic in October of the 24th year. It was the first time that the British invested in our country to build a railway. Now the enemy disregards culture and history, and this is another ironclad proof of their destruction of human peace and history.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Refugee Zones in Nanshi is Continuing</h3>
<p>Expected to be Realized in the Near Future. This Matter Will Absolutely Not Harm Our Territorial Sovereignty.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of establishing refugee zones in Nanshi, according to inquiries made by the reporter from relevant parties, this matter is currently being negotiated by the relevant parties of Britain, the United States, and France, and is expected to be realized in the near future. This is because the motivation for this matter is entirely due to the fact that since the August 13th Resistance War, the concession areas of this city have been filled with refugees, and there is no way to accommodate them. Therefore, the diplomatic authorities and charitable organizations of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, have specifically suggested to our city government that a part of Nanshi be demarcated to accommodate as many refugees from the war zone as possible in order to maintain humanity. However, this matter will absolutely not harm our territorial sovereignty in the slightest. It is purely an international refugee relief effort. Even after this matter matures, the security of the entire area will still be the responsibility of our police, and no agreement will be signed. As for the determination of the location and the handling of relief matters, it will have to be decided after detailed consultations. ××××</p>
<h3>Brief Commentary</h3>
<p>— Image</p>
<p>As the saying goes: What is gained unexpectedly is lost within expectations. All things under heaven should be viewed in this way. The more one seeks to achieve something, the more difficult it becomes. If one does not seek to achieve it, or even forgets about it, it may suddenly be achieved. This principle is truly worth considering. I observe the situation of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and am deeply concerned. What am I concerned about? That is, the countries' desire for peace in this conference is too strong. Therefore, the effect of peace will be difficult to achieve. If the countries can slightly reduce their desire for peace and prepare for non-peace, then peace may be more easily attainable. However, this matter is not easy to speak of.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Shot Down an Enemy Plane in Pudong</h3>
<p>Fuselage Damaged, Two Pilots Killed. Escaped Pilot Being Searched For</p>
<p>At 5:35 this morning, an enemy new-type bomber circled in the high sky over Pudong, hoping to bomb. When it flew over ×× Town, it was hit by our anti-aircraft artillery. The plane immediately fell, crashing on the roof of the Jin family's house there. The fuselage was damaged on the spot, and two pilots were killed at the same time. Two machine guns were recovered by the police who went to the scene, and a wooden-cased pistol was also found nearby. Fearing that there was an escaped pilot, a search is currently underway.</p>
<p>According to another report, at around 6:00 AM this morning, an enemy reconnaissance plane flew over the sky of ×× in Pudong, flying extremely low, almost touching the houses. It was hit by our garrison troops somewhere and crashed in the fields. It is said that two frightened drivers were captured. The plane was quite large, and many villagers gathered to watch it for a while. It was later dismantled by our troops and submitted to the superiors for disposal.</p>

<h3>Arrest of Notorious Traitor Huang Shijin in Xiamen and Transfer to the Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>Huang's Assistance to the Enemy and Malfeasance Substantiated; Arrest Brings Great Joy to the People</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Huang Shijin, the current manager of the Xiamen Electric Light Company and chairman of the Xiamen Waterworks Company, was arrested at his residence in Gulangyu at 3:00 PM on October 28th and transferred to the provincial capital on the morning of the 29th. It is learned that Huang, whose given name is Qingyuan and nickname "Ghost Boy," is a native of Xiamen, 68 years old this year. He formerly served as the chairman of the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce, an advisor to the Bank of Taiwan, and the owner of the Jianyuan Pawnshop and Jiansheng Pawnshop. He currently holds the positions of manager of the Xiamen Electric Light Company and chairman of the Xiamen Waterworks Company. Huang grew up in Xiamen and, for more than 30 years, has colluded with officials and drawn in merchants and hoodlums to create his local tyrannical power. During the Guangxu and Xuantong years, taking advantage of our internal strife, the Japanese transplanted a large number of Taiwanese vagrants to Xiamen, using borrowed licenses to begin establishing the foundation for the Japanese in Xiamen. At that time, the Taiwanese forces clashed with the feudal forces of Xiamen everywhere. In order to consolidate his own power, Huang took the opportunity to ingratiate himself with the Japanese consul, officially obtaining Japanese nationality. In the early years of the Republic of China, he seized the position of chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce and also served as an advisor to the Xiamen Bank, enjoying immense power for a time. Shameless merchants flocked to him like ducks, and Huang Shijin thus earned the nickname "Emperor of Xiamen." In 1915, the Xiamen Kuomintang branch, acting on the orders of President Sun Yat-sen, boycotted Japanese goods. At that time, the Bank of Taiwan issued banknotes in Xiamen amounting to more than five million yuan, controlling the financial situation of Fujian Province. Therefore, the branch comrades, under orders, decided to mobilize the public to boycott the Bank of Taiwan's banknotes as a priority, and a tide of withdrawals ensued. Within a day, more than 900,000 yuan was cashed out, and the Bank of Taiwan was already showing signs of being unable to cope. As the withdrawal trend intensified, Huang Shijin urgently convened the Xiamen General Chamber of Commerce, resolving that the chamber would notify all pawnshops in Xiamen to collect and exchange the Bank of Taiwan's banknotes on behalf of the bank. At the same time, Huang personally provided 100,000 yuan in funds and deposited them in the Bank of Taiwan to demonstrate his determination. The withdrawal tide was thus quelled. Since then, Huang has gained the further trust of the Japanese. Whatever Huang suggested, the Japanese consul followed his orders. Huang then used this extraordinary opportunity to further expand his power in all circles. A certain Yang Mingtang, a native of Hunan, was an enthusiastic patriotic youth who, angered by Huang's pro-Japanese and harmful actions against the country, threw a bomb at Huang, but failed to kill him. Huang immediately had Yang arrested. In 1921, Zang Zhiping guarded Xiamen. Detectives had conflicts with Taiwanese and organized self-defense groups, forming teams and openly parading through the streets with weapons to confront the local authorities. Huang secretly donated 5,000 Mauser pistols to the Taiwanese. This was heard by the Caozai'an faction (most of the detective chiefs at the time were Caozai'an people), and they gradually became estranged from Huang. During the successive anti-Japanese movements, when the Chinese people strictly banned Japanese goods, Huang used his borrowed license to openly smuggle in large quantities of Japanese goods, immune from inspection by anti-Japanese organizations. Therefore, Huang made a fortune every time there was a boycott. Since Huang took charge of the Xiamen Electric Light and Water Companies, he firmly advocated hiring Japanese for inspection of water and electricity in order to show off his power. Therefore, since 1935, the inspectors of the Xiamen Electric Light and Water Companies have been filled by Japanese and Taiwanese. Users were often subjected to beatings and insults by the Taiwanese on false pretenses, and the people dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out. Huang hung a Japanese nationality plate in Xiamen. The total value of his business establishments, real estate, and houses, amounting to several million yuan, was never taxed. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Huang has continued to cling to his evil ways, claiming to flee to Hong Kong, but in reality hiding in Gulangyu. After the provincial authorities obtained conclusive evidence, they were ordered by their superiors to send personnel to Xiamen to arrest him and transfer him to the province for investigation. It is also heard that Huang was internally designated by the enemy as the chairman of the pseudo-Xiamen Security Maintenance Association. Evidence has been found and sent to the province along with him.</p>
<h3>Nanking University Purchases National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Totaling 12,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: The government's issuance of national salvation bonds is closely related to the overall situation of the War of Resistance. All citizens should enthusiastically subscribe. Nanking University in this city has always been among the first to contribute to patriotic donations. Due to the impact of the war this time, the school started later, and a small number of teachers and staff were unable to get to school due to transportation issues. Therefore, it was not until last week that all teachers and staff unanimously agreed to use more than half a month's salary to purchase national salvation bonds, totaling approximately more than 12,000 yuan. The school will remit the funds to the central government first, and then deduct the amount in four months. As the school is a private institution, it is not well-funded, and the salaries of teachers and staff are lower than those of other schools. Moreover, the current salaries are issued in accordance with the central government's national crisis salary. Therefore, this achievement is truly remarkable.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Expedite Registration of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Percentage of Bond Purchases Has Been Changed; Various Opinions Are Being Reviewed Separately</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified the various trade associations related to Japanese goods, stating: "To the point, we have received a letter from the Shanghai National Committee for Economic Severance with Japan, stating that we have received your chamber's letter, along with a copy of the opinions of various trade associations regarding the deadline for registering Japanese goods, the percentage of bond purchases, and the concentration of storage and public sale, requesting separate responses. Our chamber has submitted the case to a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees for discussion. The resolutions are hereby communicated as follows: ⑴ The registration deadline has been extended by seven days to November 7th. No further extension will be granted after the deadline. This has been announced in the newspapers. We urge your chamber to forward this to the various trade associations, urging them not to wait and see and to submit their reports as soon as possible. ⑵ The percentage of national salvation bond purchases has been resolved to be 30% of the proceeds from the public sale of goods, a reduction of 20% from the original plan of 50%. ⑶ The two measures regarding the concentrated storage and concentrated public sale of Japanese goods have also been formulated and announced. As for the various opinions put forward by the various trade associations, our chamber has hired expert committee members to review them separately, striving to adopt them as much as possible while ensuring convenient procedures and eliminating malpractices. Regarding the above items, we request your chamber to separately inform the various trade associations and forward them to the various trade firms." The committee has already made some adjustments to the main points of the numerous opinions and suggestions put forward by the various industries regarding the handling of Japanese goods. The rest are still under expert study. The registration period is about to end, and the letter states that no further extension will be granted. All trade associations must urge their members to expedite the process.</p>
<h3>Silk Mills in the Concession Safety Zone Resume Operations</h3>
<p>Three silk mills, Ewo, Hongfeng, and Tongyu, in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, recognizing that the domestic silk inventory is gradually decreasing and that the amount of cocoons in storage is quite large, have repeatedly planned to resume silk reeling. However, due to enemy aircraft bombing Wuxi in Jiangsu and Jiaxing, Hangzhou, and Changan in Zhejiang from time to time, they have not been successful in order to avoid danger. In Shanghai, the silk mills that have resumed operations are Ewo on North Chengdu Road, with 652 reeling machines, Hongfeng on Avenue Albert, with 240 reeling machines, and Tongyu, with 240 reeling machines. The total number of machines in these three factories is 1,130. As for the silk mills in Nanshi, Zhabei, Longhua, Hongkou, and other places, they are unable to resume operations because they are located in war zones and alert zones. According to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, these are the only three silk mills in the concession safety zone.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Industry to strengthen labor union organizations and lead workers to strive for production, it dispatched Lan Simian, the director of the registration section, and Zhou Funong, the director of the civil training section of the Municipal Party Department, to discuss specific measures. It is heard that they have agreed on the first step: to conduct a general survey of labor unions throughout the city. The second step will be to guide each labor union to strengthen its organization. At the same time, they will find ways to reorganize labor unions that have stalled their activities. This will be carried out in sequence.</p>

<h3>Extension of Public Bond Delivery to March Next Year</h3>
<p>A Significant Amount Held on Account; Request Submitted to the Ministry of Finance for Approval</p>
<p>The Securities Exchange, recognizing that the bulls in the August and September futures markets are unable to take delivery of the goods and have not yet completed the delivery, convened a joint meeting of representatives from the board of directors, the brokerage association, and official and commercial banks for careful deliberation in order to handle the matter prudently. As a result, it was resolved to extend the delivery period to March of next year. The issue of interest during the extension period will be handled in a compromise manner, with the three yuan of interest issued by the Ministry of Finance at the end of January next year going entirely to the bears. The plan has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval after the decision was made. According to a reporter's investigation, the amount held on account in the August and September contracts is quite large, with the double account in August being more than 100 million yuan. In September, due to the settlement between the bulls and bears by the brokers, the single account was only more than 10 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Children's Welfare Association Establishes Children's Shelter</h3>
<p>Capacity of 500 to 1,000; More Than 8,000 Already Received in the Northwest</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the China Children's Welfare Association has established a children's shelter in this city, accommodating more than 100 orphaned and helpless young refugees. It has recently decided to expand the organization, seeking larger locations to establish several shelters with a capacity of 500 to 1,000 people. In the future, it plans to establish orphanages in safe areas in the interior. This morning, a reporter also visited Mr. Chen Tiesheng, the deputy general secretary of the association, who informed him that the association had been preparing to establish permanent children's shelters in Xi'an, Luoyang, and other places before the War of Resistance. To date, there are more than 8,000 people in Xi'an, Luoyang, and other places, and more than 200,000 yuan has been raised, which can cover one year's expenses. In the future, it plans to establish shelters in Sichuan, Hunan, and other provinces, actively seeking thorough education that combines education and care for the future masters of the country. Mr. Chen recently stated that the preparations in the Northwest had just been completed, and the full-scale War of Resistance has established a long-term war of resistance, and there are even more war zone children who are displaced and lost. It has been decided to establish large-scale children's shelters in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. After this is slightly settled, he will continue to work hard in the West, and together with various cities, establish children's orphanages in various provinces and counties.</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Approximately 10 Yuan per Dan</p>
<p>Since the start of the Shanghai war, the cotton in the war zones has been damaged without remainder. For example, the cotton produced in the villages of the Pudong area of the alert line cannot be sold, and the farmers' economy has suffered greatly. Therefore, the financial community in this city attaches great importance to this agricultural product and provides loans to purchase it. On the one hand, the local relevant groups organized the Pudong Cotton Production and Marketing Association to preside over all production and marketing affairs. The price of cotton was originally set at seven yuan per dan according to the Ministry of Industry. According to a reporter's investigation, due to the relocation of factories to safe areas after the factories resumed operations, the demand for cotton is extremely urgent, so the market price has automatically increased to 8.5 yuan per dan. Due to the war, transportation in Pudong is slightly difficult, and the transportation cost is more than one yuan per dan, with a total cost of approximately 10 yuan per dan. Currently, it is limited to storage in warehouses, and it is still not possible to purchase as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Enemy Goods Starch Sell Well</h3>
<p>Recently, enemy goods starch has been selling well in this city. The goods are all affixed with "Hokkaido Agricultural Product Inspection Ticket" and stamped with the round stamp of refined Taiwanese starch. It is heard that the above-mentioned enemy goods have been transferred and sold by cunning merchants in the Southern Goods industry. The industry is now paying close attention and reporting to the Economic Severance Committee at any time.</p>
<h3>Liang Hejun Enters Nanjing Last Night</h3>
<p>Mr. Liang Hejun, the chairman of the National Sugar Committee of the Ministry of Finance, has been transferred to the position of Director of the Finance Department of Gansu Province. He entered Nanjing last night to report to the central authorities and request instructions before transferring to Gansu to take up his new post. Before his departure, many of Mr. Liang's relatives and friends, including Lang Guangrui, Shi Yucun, Zheng Zenan, and Chen Xinfu, went to the train to see him off.</p>
<h3>Female Corpse in Bathtub Dies of Suffocation</h3>
<p>Corpse Claimed by Husband After Filing a Guarantee; Details Under Strict Investigation by the Police</p>
<p>On the 2nd, a person named "Shi Shengji" checked into Room 201 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road. Afterwards, several men and women continued to arrive. On the morning of the 3rd, the person who claimed to be Shi Shengji left. At 11:10 AM, the tea servant discovered a woman dead in the bathtub of the room. The case was reported to the police, who took the corpse to the morgue. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Zhang Yuanjing, the Chinese detective of the Old Gate Police Station, has found that the deceased is named Shen Yuzhen, 34 years old, the wife of Huang Weiyuan, 33 years old, a native of Jiading, the owner of the Meili Raisin Company at No. 13, Lane 296, Gongguan Road, French Concession. They have been married for many years. The company formerly employed a salesman named Shi Shengqi. At that time, there were rumors that Shi and Huang Shen Yuzhen had an affair. It is said that she helped Shi with some money and opened a cigarette and paper shop in Zhabei. On the 2nd of the month, she suddenly disappeared. At that time, she took away some cash and a gold ring. The case was reported to the police. When the police went to No. 201 to investigate, they saw that she was only wearing a small short shirt and trousers. All of her cheongsam, cash, gold ring, and wallet were missing. There was also a note in the room, the meaning of which seemed to be that she claimed to have committed suicide. However, it was found that she could not write, which was obviously forged by someone. Under the detailed examination by Prosecutor Song of the Special No. 1 Court and forensic doctor Zhang Yan yesterday, it was seen that although there seemed to be a rope mark under her neck, it was not obvious, so it could not be determined that she was strangled. However, based on various circumstances and the amount of water the deceased had inhaled, it was temporarily determined that she died of suffocation. However, according to the Central tea servant, the appearance and age of Shi Shengji were very similar to Shi Shengqi. Therefore, Prosecutor Song has now ruled that Huang Shen died of suffocation, and the corpse was claimed by her husband, Huang Weiyuan, after filing a guarantee. The circumstances of the case should be strictly investigated by the police.</p>

<h3>War of Resistance and Service</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxing</p>
<p>Since our leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, delivered three speeches, the position of War of Resistance has been determined, and "Total War of Resistance" has become our unshakable national policy.</p>
<p>On August 13th, the full-scale War of Resistance opened in Shanghai. The enemy, with an army of more than 200,000 men and fierce artillery fire from land, sea, and air, attacked us. However, we have repeatedly inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy, causing them to be trapped in a corner of Songhu and unable to advance. Although we recently retreated to the second line of defense due to strategic reasons, Greater Shanghai is still in our hands, and what the enemy has gained is only a pile of broken bricks and tiles in Zhabei, which is undeniably a loss. Moreover, they cannot occupy it for long!</p>
<p>In North China, although we have lost much territory, our War of Resistance has never slackened as a result. Nor do we recognize this as our failure. The enemy troops in Shanxi have been pressing on Taiyuan, and it seems very critical these days, but our military authorities have transferred large troops to reinforce and counterattack, so there is no need to worry. It is said that after the enemy gets Shanxi, the military will temporarily stop and first put on the stage the puppet show of the autonomy of the five provinces of North China.</p>
<p>However, the fact is not so easy. The puppets may take the stage, but our War of Resistance will not stop. We cannot allow the enemy to run rampant on our territory. We must continue to use our national policy to strive for the final victory and implement the established policy.</p>
<p>We are not afraid of the enemy's ferocity, and we are even more afraid of the enemy's artillery fire. Since the government has declared the policy of War of Resistance to us, we can only establish the determination to fight for War of Resistance. We have strength, and we gather the strength of every young person in the rear to be the backing of the War of Resistance. I believe that victory is within our grasp.</p>
<p>In the past, before the War of Resistance was launched, when the enemy oppressed us to the point that we were not allowed to even say the word "Japan" and had to replace it with "××," each of us—especially the general youth—could not wait to kill the enemy and flatten the three islands. Now that the War of Resistance has been launched, it is time for the national masses to exhale and also time to serve the party and the country. How should we seize the opportunity to vent our pent-up anger of the past forty years? Now we must use all our strength, tightly grasp the enemy, and strike at his vital parts, and not easily let him go.</p>
<p>We have strength, and we should serve the country and society with strength; War of Resistance will not stop, and service will not stop; War of Resistance to the end, service to the end.</p>
