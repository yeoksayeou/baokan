<p>時評</p>
<h3>林內閣的對華“明朗外交”</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>日本林內閣於本月一日成立時。本定駐美大使齊藤博為外務大臣。齊藤宋返國就任前暫由林首相代理。現在齊藤已表示不就。而新閣又未考慮新外相人選。林首相勢必自兼外相職務。日本自有內閣組織以來。外相的職務幾全由職業的外交家擔任。非職業外交家之擔任外相職務者僅有數人。且多為兼任外相之總理。這些非由職業外交家擔任外相的內閣。據美國柯里格羅夫教授研究結果。大多不能維持至很久時期。（見本年一月出版之美國國際法季刊）現在由首相兼任外相的林內閣。是否能够逃出柯里格羅夫教授的論断。自然須待事實的證明。我們且不論這些較大較遠的事情。而來分析一下林兼外相所宣布的對華外交政策。</p>
<p>林兼外相在十五日議會中所發表的外交演説。雖涉到各方面。但其中最重次白當然是關於對華的政策林外相的對華外交。是所謂“明朗外交。”“明朗外交”的意義。用林外相的話來説是。“二國民衆應自此融和感情。企圖國交關係之明朗化。互相携手。以期實現東亞之安定。……彼此努力理解二國之立場。非僅政府如此。尤須刺激民間之接觸。以發揚日華提携協助之實績。同時茍有阻害之者。即當進而排除之。”這個“明朗外交。”在表面看起來。比廣田的三原則要動聽得多。尤其是林首相在議會中對於議員責問的答辭。最能引起一般“有識之士”的幻想。例如林首相在貴族院中答復阪谷芳郎質問時説。“日本不欲侵略華北。且遇有此等機會時。當盡力消釋誤會。”又在眾議院。答復植原之質問時説。“日本不特迭次表示其不侵略中國且俟有機會時。將再作此表示。余完全對君表示同情。以為認清中國新局勢。實有必要。”這些結的字面。都是可口的蜜糖。而它的骨子卻充滿了毒辣的意味。這我們不必引出許多理由來説明。祇要看同盟社的自供就可知道了。十六日同盟社的東京電訊於引述林外相的演辭“……同時茍有阻害中日提携者。即當進而排除之”後。就接着解釋説。“此言即表示林內閣的對華政策。以親善工作為基礎。但為違成此目的。不辭實施強硬措置之决意。”這就是説日本對華政策的第一步在於要求中國朝野一掃排日空氣。其項即進而要求解决各項縣案。如我國有一部勢力阻止此項解决者。即不辭採取強硬手段排除之。我們觀於日本通信社的自供。已很可明暸林內閣對華“明朗外交”所含的積極意義。而不容我們作甚麽幻想了。</p>
<p>林內閣的對華積極政策。從外相的外交演説中固然可以推知。而從林內閣的本質觀察。更可以明顯的意味到。這在本報三日時評中業已説明。最近藏相撤回馬場所編預算。重行改編。節省支出二億六千餘萬元。而獨於軍事費一項。絲毫未减。林內閣於八日發表的政綱中。其第四點亦極力説明充實國防之重要。觀此種種措施。可知新閣無一不以軍部之命是從。因此林兼外相的對華外交。當然也説不了軍部勢力的支配。</p>
<p>我們對於這所謂對華的“明朗外交。”應常採取怎樣的應付方針呢。很明顯的。過去一年的經驗已經告訴我們祇有採取不喪權不辱國的堅决政策。才能擊破侵略者的陰謀與野心。現在正當討論重大國策的三中全會開會之際。我們尤希望到會諸公對於“如何收復已被侵略的領土和主權”和“如何保衛將受侵略的領土和主權”這兩個問題。能夠立即商决切實的辦法。</p>
<h3>英下院討論對德談判情形</h3>
<p>僅就各項問題交換意見　英無意考慮歸還殖民地</p>
<p>［倫敦］德國要求恢復戰前殖民地問題、為昨夜下院中討論最重要之點、政府會受議員方面連斷乏質問、首由保守黨議員洛克蘭浦生詢問關於上星期德大使里賓特羅甫與代理外相哈立法克斯談話之結果、可否由外相艾登宣佈、彼復請政府允諾、在未經議會討論之前、不得以殖民地歸還德國、或給以海外貿易機會之諾言、現因外相艾登尚在假期中、故洛克蘭浦生之問題遂由外次克蘭波代答、謂最近代理外相哈立法克斯與德大使里賓特羅甫之談話、尚未能認為交涉之開始、不過在兩國俱有關係之各種問題上、略為交換意見而已、彼復提及首相包爾溫在去年四月二十七日所發表之宣言、謂英政府並未討論該問題云、保守黨議員亞當士繼詢外相、為免除德國非分之想起見、外相可否以明白無疑之言詞、聲明現在英國政治管轄下之領土、無論何地、英政府均不作歸還國社主義德國之想、克蘭波答稱、如彼所已經聲明者英政府對於此問題、前既未會加以考慮、現亦不在考慮之中、亞當士曰、“豈目前討論不在進行中乎、”克蘭波答、“余固已一再言之、前既未曾討論過、現亦不在討論中也、”後自由黨議員海立斯復問、外間報紙所刊載之消息、是否完全無稽、克蘭波謂、誠然、保守常議員桑狄斯遂提出决議、內稱、“德國雖已提出關於殖民地之要求、但下院對於政府之不允考慮任何領土之歸還、表示滿意、”（中央社十六日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］克朗波恩爵士代表外相答復下院之詢問稱、準備石集五強會議訂結西歐公约之外交談判、正在進行中、工黨議員欲知法俄公约簽訂後、傳説德政府願取銷一九三六年三月關於西歐公约之建議、此項謠言究竟有無根據、克朗波恩爵士答稱、德政府並未向英政府提出此項照會、謠言並無事實之根據、該議員又問、德政府何故不答上年五月間英政府提出之問題表、克朗波恩爵士答稱、德政府以英國尚未發表對於國聯將來之意見為理由、克朗波恩答復關於意國軍艦參加瑪拉迦戰役之問題稱、英政府並未接得此項消息、並謂巴塞洛那與瑪德里駐有蘇俄軍隊云、（十五日國民電）</p>

<p>［羅馬］國際農學院發表統計稱、本年度中國美國蘇聯三國棉花產額均有增加、以故世界棉花產額、當較去年增加一千萬公担、而為六千六百萬公担、至棉花現有存貨則為二千八百萬公担左右云、各經濟學專家以為棉花產額雖將增加、但價格則不至低落、緣產額增加最多之國、乃係中國蘇聯兩國、各該國往昔、原屬供不應求、此後自不致生產過剩、加之各處需要狀况、亦足使人滿意、其他各種主要原料價格亦均見漲、以故棉花價格自不至低落云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日本議會質問財政軍政</h3>
<p>陸相宣言努力肅軍　海相保證絕不干政</p>
<p>［東京］日議會今日繼續順利進行、各政黨均極端謹愼、力圖避免衝突、目前殆可確切預言、貴族院中之質問、泰半關於預算及蹂躪人權問題、衆議院則大都集中於㊀研究國民經濟問題、㊁樹立幣制政策問題、㊂抑制物價暴漲及救濟農村經濟方法、政友會議員宮協長吉提出關於縮軍及軍人干政問題之質問、常時全院空氣頓趨緊張、宮脇並列舉實例證明肅軍之未能令人滿意、及軍人干政之違背軍紀、要求陸相明白答復、斯時呌囂之聲四起、有高呼日、“多言將招致解散矣”、同時贊助宮脇者則請其儘量提出質問、使聽衆感覺有發生危險之虞、海相米內光政首登壇致答曰、海軍絕對無人干政、即將來亦决無此舉、言至此、掌聲與歡呼聲四起、震耳欲聾、米內繼作重要聲明曰、日本决不欲為世界最大之海軍國云、陸相杉山元繼登壇作答、謂現已從事澈底肃軍之努力、本人已具此决心、且余既忝任陸相、則凡余之部屬、在職責上難免有事項向余報告、但不能允彼等向外有所表示也、陸相詞畢、院中亦報以掌聲、此種嚴重質問、竟能和平結束、更足表示目前政黨意向、（十六日中央社電）</p>
<h3>林內閣對華政策</h3>

<h3>貴衆兩院質問情形</h3>
<p>［東京］第二日之衆院大會、因受政友會內部騷動之餘波、遲延半小時始開會、仍繼續質問國務大臣之演説、</p>
<p>政友之太田正孝登壇質問四點、</p>
<p>㊀準戰時財政一語、往往似財政其物準備戰爭、而外交乃為無用者、究竟如何、</p>
<p>㊀政府為抑制物價騰貴之故、修正預算、然减少地方交付金、可使產價低减乎、預期拖延而踏襲舊頂算、此事不可、且違反憲法、</p>
<p>㊀因國防費之增大與公債之增加、致生活安定費縮少、政府對此有何財政計晝、</p>
<p>㊀金融間題對於預算上之資金以外、民間產業資金對滿資金有計畫否、政府减少繳付滿鐵之資金、其理由安在、</p>
<p>結城藏相答</p>
<p>軍事費與國民生活安定費之均衡、此余深所憂慮者也、欲打開地方農村之窮乏、整理負債最為緊要、故關於交付金制度、希望暫與以考究之餘地、至於將來財政之預測、昨已言明尚無把握、此乃現在社會情勢使然、無可如何者、余嘗比較高橋藏相時代與馬場藏相時代欲折衷兩氏之財政方針而行之、惟成否未可必耳云、陳述極懷疑的見解、笑聲與掌聲相半、</p>
<p>太田氏再登壇陳述都市與農村之負擔不均、對於增稅亦表示不滿、</p>
<p>宮澤胤勇（民政）質問關於金融·產業·中小商工業政策等節、詢及政府之見解、當時政友會席上議員稀少、宮澤氏仍繼續力説對滿投資之必要、及對於中小商工業之生產方策若何等語、</p>
<p>結城藏相答、</p>
<p>政府對於低利辦法仍擬繼續前內閣同樣實施、至於因此逆轉之惡影響、自應與各方面協力防止、</p>
<p>其次由伍堂商相山崎農相等有所答辯後、由林首相作答如左、</p>
<p>對滿投資倘有必要、自當極力促其活動、至於安定國民生活余亦抱有同樣之關心、</p>
<p>宮澤氏再登臺、略謂、</p>
<p>首相僅謂抱有同感、究不知擁有若何方案、倘僅屬同感而已、則議會未便進行審議也、</p>
<p>結城藏相代為答辯如左、該項方法正在考慮、但不能在此説明、几尚非説明之時期故也、</p>
<p>宮脇長吉（政友）對於國防費、肅軍與軍人干政問題、提出質問、於是議場頓現緊張之狀、略謂近有少數軍人干政、倘政府不採取斷然之態度、則將來造成意外情勢、事有必至、應請軍部大臣以身作則而軌範之云云、</p>
<p>米內海相答、</p>
<p>日本帝國海軍採取不受他國威脅、亦不侵略他國乏精神、以努力安定東亞並不與他國作軍備競爭、亦不欲建設世界唯一之海軍、至肅軍問題、期以無誤圣旨、將來自應益加努力、</p>
<p>杉山陸相以滿面興奮之神氣、登臺答辯如左、</p>
<p>關於國防費已如昭和十二年度預算上所載之情形、至於詳細數字、則事關軍備、未便説明、對於肅軍、自寺內大臣時代以來、熱心向此目的努力、毋待再言、余認為此事迄今尚未完成、非俟今後之努力不可、二六事件之勃發、原囚究在何處、當待國民全體反省之處尚多、軍人干政自前任大臣時代以來、嚴重加以警戒者也、</p>
<p>林首相答辯</p>
<p>軍人在職責上當然不得干政、但大臣在職責、當然得以干政、</p>
<p>宮脇氏又謂請勿許少數軍人干玫、以便矯正今日之惡習、並望以國防為基礎而確立外交政策等語、林兼外相答以從事協調、不便構亂等語、於是肅軍問題之對答至此、暫告一段落、</p>
<p>民政黨之濱野徹太郎對於宋垣內閣之流產、與軍部大臣限定由現役大將或中將任之及要求脫黨問題、認為係軍人干政之甚者、質其理由、</p>
<p>杉山陸相答</p>
<p>字垣大將之組閣若認為軍人妨害、當屬誤會、三長官固已推選候補人員、但均由各候補人辭退、軍部大臣限定現役大將或中將、係鑑於軍備進步之現狀而負責者、須知軍內情形當為絕對必要、在鄉將校有所未便故也、又軍部大臣掌管關於軍令之事項、倘非現役當為不妥林首相答以並未排斥政黨、至閣員兼任居多、决非模彷西法斯蒂、理由別有所在、余願尊重憲法、寶施獨特之立憲政治云、午後六時二十六分散會、</p>
<p>［東京］貴院大會、今日上午十時開會、十久保首先登壇列舉前年衆院選舉時在各縣之蹂躪人權拷問事件之實例、希望根絕拷問行為與警察之處置而降壇、均鼓掌、河原田內相登壇答辯、謂在圣代頻發如此之拷問事件、殊為遺憾、政府將來擬根絕此不祥事件云、次管原通敬提出財政問題、登壇質問、對於新預算及增稅提出得意之長質問、然亦不過貴族院式一面之質問而已、於是質問戰之舞台、移於午後之衆院大會、（十六日同盟電）</p>

<p>“竊查甘肅地瘠民貧、自民國十六七年、迭遭災患、元氣迄未恢復、不幸窮途共匪、先後全部入甘、蹂躪遍於全省、災情奇重、空前未有、兹將災區曁損失概况、分陳如左、</p>
<p>被災區域</p>
<p>二十三年共匪劉子丹、楊森、等股、盤踞隴東慶陽五屬、二十四年、匪首毛澤東·彭德懷·徐海東·等股、由陝南川北、分道竄入、擾害隴東南各屬三十餘縣、去年匪首朱德·徐向前·蕭克·賀龍·等股、由川北傾巢入境、經洮水流域、擾遍隴束北南、分竄河西一帶、其攻陷城邑、計有臨潭·漳縣·渭源·成縣·徽縣·兩當·通渭·會甯·隆德·崇信·環縣·合水·康縣·景泰·古浪·永昌·民樂·臨澤·山舟·高台·等二十縣、擾害最重縣分·計有岷縣·臨洮·隴西·武山·甘谷·天水·泰安·定西·靜甯·莊浪·西和·禮縣·華亭·化平·平凉·涇川·正甯·甯縣·慶陽·鎮原·海源·固原·靖遠·永登·武威·民勤·張掖·等二十七縣、其次若臯蘭·榆中·康樂·夏河·清水·靈台·武都·西周·等十餘縣、亦均受其害、甘肅全省北六十八縣、被災縣分、將及六十縣、幾至全省盡成災區、</p>
<p>被災損失</p>
<p>甘肅純屬農業省區、工商業向不發達、農民蓄藏、僅僅為糧食牲畜、共匪劉子丹·毛澤束·等股、踞隴東北一帶二三年之久、早已搜括盡净、去年朱德·徐向前·各匪、經過松潘·毛兒蓋·窮荒地方、疲備不堪、一入甘境、不但糧食牲畜、搶掠一空、即農民窖藏財物、亦羅掘無餘、除河西損失、尚未得調查確數外、隴東南各縣、計損失糧食二百一十五萬五千四百餘石、損失各項牲畜一千零三十七萬六千餘頭、其他各項損失、為數之鉅、不在食糧牲畜之下、至於直接被災人口、已達三四百萬、约占甘肅總人口半數以上、若連同間接受匪災影響之人民計、可謂全省盡成災民、</p>

<h3>所謂中國人民陣綫的眞相及其理論的檢討（續）</h3>
<p>— 駱美奐</p>
<p>“一般誤解聯合陣線的人，以為我們既然共同站在一起了，我們盟友間用不着再什末門爭的……</p>
<p>“聯合陣綫絕對不就是消減了陣綫內的矛盾，並且聯合陣綫本身也就是在不斷鬥爭中存續着。要友間的門爭仍然是不可否認的事實。策略與戰衛的運用本身就是一種鬥爭的過程，聯合戰綫內部可以説是全賴於這種門爭血生存發展的。………所以，因為着聯合而　懼內部鬥爭而迴避應有的門爭，不獨不是對聯合戰綫有利，而是對於共同的神圣的戰爭的一種不忠實，……</p>
<p>（以上見柳提救亡的基本認識）</p>
<p>這就是他們主張聯合的眞意。我們曉得，他們一方面反對“唯武器論”，主張馬上抗戰，一方面又主張在抗戰之中，一面對外抗爭，一面對內門爭，這種萬能的戰術，古今中外，恐怕沒有見過·這種聯合的結果，是連亡而不是救亡，是自召內亂而不是統一禦侮，更是顯然可以見得着的車實·</p>
<p>他們之意，以為中國抗敵戰爭，非由中國共產黨領導不可，思想和他不同的人，𠵍時騙他聯合，但在聯合過程中，要絕對受他的支配，你不受支配，便來內部鬥爭，鬥爭到完成到清一色為止，他們説：“因為運動越到後來，隊伍也越變的純粹精銳龐大·眞正意議的戰士，也只有在這進行中，才能培養出鍊鍜出的。”（見柳湜把千萬願子彈打在一個靶上。）這裏所請純粹龐大的是甚麽，所謂培養出鍊鍜出的甚麽，可以不説自明。</p>
<p>所以聯合戰綫就是共產陣綫，在聯合以內的人，都是他們的貓腳爪，在抗敵未完成以前，他已經决定把你吃下去，只要求得擴大他們赤色恐怖的勢力，只要報效於他們的祖國的共黨國際，犧牲了國家民族，他們是一點都無所吝情的。</p>
<p>第二：是暴動民衆而不是武裝民衆。</p>
<p>應付國難，當然應該發動全國民衆，武裝抗敵，而武裝民衆之先决條件，必須先授以軍事上基本智識之訓練，年來政府辦理軍訓的意義，便在這裹，而且已經有了很好的成績，這是任何國民都應該引以為慰的一件事，然而別具肺腑的人民陣線的人們。一方面在高呼武裝民衆，一方面卻反對政府實施軍事訓練，請看他們對於反對軍事訓練之煽動：</p>
<p>“如今花樣又翻新，軍訓軍訓整天忙，整天忙來叫你心身都累倒，卻教人説努力建國防”（李公樸主選中國呼聲集第十六章）</p>
<p>“民不聊生，就是全國皆兵，全國的錢都拿去買飛機大砲，然而餓肚子是走不動啊？又怎能拿起槍來。”（高士其寄給肺癆病勞苦大衆的一封信）</p>
<p>要應付國難，大家應當不應當吃一點苦？軍訓的苦，比之前方忍凍浴血抗戰的將士又怎樣？民不聊生是一回事，國家當要想法救濟，難道因爲民不聊生，便以為國不必救，國防不必建立，而一任敵人飛機大砲來任意壓迫嗎？這在人民陣綫的人們，未嘗不知之深切，他們的用意，是在暴動民衆，而不是在武裝民衆，因為暴動民衆才是共產黨的拿手劇，因為暴動民衆才可以達到他們乘火劫殺的目的。政府辦理軍事訓練，使全國民衆步驟齊，是國家的利，卻是共產黨的害，他們反對軍訓，反對充實國防的理由在此，他們所高唱武裝民衆抗敵救亡的眞意亦在此。</p>
<p>第三：他們想造成割據的局面。</p>
<p>他們滿口統一，滿口聯合，可是他們實賤的方法，却是思造成割據的局面，他們説：</p>
<p>“……進而各黨派開一個聯合議，在地方政權，事實的政權方面，我以為第一步彼此承認其有在，給各方政權取大自治權力，同樣由政黨的談判到地方政權的談判與合作，各地方的武裝方面，也採以上的方式，達到合作和統一。”李公樸政治的國防動員</p>
<p>這完全抄襲了十多年前聯省自治的老調，有理諭上是不通，在事實上除了少數像釜底游魚的赤匪外，所有全國的地方政權，全國的地方民衆，都強着於國民黨領導之十，還談甚末談話，甚末合作？甚末彼此承認其存在？為了要求少數共匪的存在，而唱了劃據的主張，挑撥了地方政府對中央的感情，這才是人民陣綫們天天所　榜的良心主張。</p>
<p>第四：關於中國人不打中國人問題</p>
<p>中國人不打中國人，這話是對的，但應有其限度。就是凡是危害國家民族的漢奸匪寇，雖然他們具有中華民族的血統關係，可是我們應擯諸國家民族以外絕對不能認為中國人，更絕對不能以“中國人不打中國人”道句話應用到這班人身上，不獨這樣，並且我們更應該打他，使他清減，免得為對外之阻礙。例如殷汝耕之流，他何嘗不是一黃帝子孫”，他何嘗不標榜自治救國，如果對殷汝耕之流也談中國人不打中國人，豈非笑話？</p>
<p>人民陣綫喊出這個口號，自然是針對赤匪而言，但赤匪之不能成爲中國人，已經有鐵一般的事實為證。就他們的信仰説，他們的祖國是共產國際，而不是中華民國，他們已經沒有中國國家民族的觀念。沒有中國國家民族觀忿的人，那裹算得上中國人？再就他們的行動説：十餘年來他們慘殺無辜焚燬廬舍，造成十餘省的匪荒，損失了不可勝計的國力，因而招致了外患的侵壓他們在在積極做消減中國人和中國國力的工作，在為敵人造侵略的機會，這種行動，又能够算寫中國人嗎？如果高喊國際主義的、可以算做中國人，則號召大亞細亞主義的人，何嘗不可以算做中國人？如果認以恐怖政策來建立蘇維埃的共產黨是中國人，則標榜自治主義　道主義的東北冀察各種僞組織、伺嘗不可以認做中國人？所以，對中國共產黨談“中國人不打中國人，和　偽組織談中國人不打中國人”，是一樣的荒謬。</p>
<p>團結眞正愛國的中國人，來消滅背叛國家民族的冒牌愛國的中國人，這是我們在奮門求生中的正當辦法。</p>
<p>我們了上文，曉得民陣綫就是共產陣綫，曉得人民陣綫的主張，是一種毒害國家民族的主張。我們站在“中國人”的立場，只有不留除地的加以𢬶減，同時希望一般人云亦云的附和者，趕快覺悟，投向三民主義旗幟之下，負起救國的責任。</p>
<p>或者有人説，中國共產黨近年在危難中茍延殘喘，似乎有點覺悟了，如果他們誠意抗敵，則　團結力量起見，似乎不宜拒絕過甚。其實不然，第一：共產黨絕對沒有信用道德的觀念，他們十一年參加國民革命，會經宣誓過要實行國民黨的政網，但一到他們稍有力量，便想把國民黨消減，這是已往容共的教訓。第一：他們自九一八以來，便有抗日的宣傳，並且有北上抗日先遣隊，抗日聯軍種種的名稱，表面上看來，似乎也慷慨激昂，實心為國，但當九一八抗敵之役，在江西的國軍，奉命調滬參無抗戰，但剛開到南昌，共產黨便頃全力襲擊吉安，後來國軍回師吉安，雖然把共產黨打敗，但因援滬較遲，遂結束淞滬的戰局，這裏不獨證明他們沒有一絲一毫抗敵的意思，而且極力牽制國軍抗敵之進行。他們現在老調重彈，仍不過是取瑟而歌之意，我們决不能再上其當。如果他們眞有覺悟，由政府已經有了“自新”的規定，他們尚有投幼的機會。至若倡言分庭抗　的—聯合，則我們唯有貫安內攘外的主張，方不至直對外之牽制。（完）</p>

<h3>倫敦投資紀事報論我國新政策</h3>
<p>對蔣委員長孔部長備加頌揚</p>
<p>中央社云、倫敦投資記事報The　Investor's　chronicls會於本月十三日發表一文、題為“中國之新策”、對我國年來金融情勢、作正確之敘述、上海字林西報、曾予轉載、但未披露全部、兹迻譯全文如下、</p>
<p>完成滬柜甬鐵路估券、最近之列入倫敦證券交易所也、堪為執有中國債券者之一種佳兆、邇來羣衆漸信中政府之財政現受一種新政策之指導、證以此事、益覺信然、按中國債券之分為下連三類已為衆所皆知之事、即㊀信用最高者、此為以關説為抵之借欵數種、內含一八九八年四厘五英德績借𣣅、一九二五年五厘中法庚欵美金債券、一九一三年五厘善後借欵、此三種本息按期照發、未有停頓、㊁以鹽課凈收入為抵之監務借欵、內含一九○八年四厘五英法借欵一九一一年湖廣鐵路借欵一九一二年克利斯浦借欵、八厘費克斯票與馬可尼票、此項借欵發給本息之成績較差、其中唯一九○八年四厘五英法偕欵本息按期照付、一九一二年克利浦斯借欵之息、雖按則照發、而本會則已愆期矣今始從事每年加倍還本、藉以彌補焉、費克斯票與馬可尼票、在一九一八至一九年發行後、其息綫即停發直至一九三六年杪當局始允績發、㊂鐵路借欵其中僅一八九九年發行之五厘京秦鐵路借欵、曾按期發給本息、餘則均已愆期、久暫不一、惟當局現已允依照一九三六年整理計劃續付相當之息金矣、</p>
<p>就全盤而論、上述各種借欵、皆在十九世紀中所發行、惟就日期而論、內有數種、實在二十世紀中發行、會有一整批借欵、直接為十九世紀中大興鐵路工程而發行者、另有非鐵路借欵一大部份、實際亦係供發展鐵路之用、曩者最可靠之借欵政府機構內之外人行政機關供給擔保品、此項擔保品雖政府本身亦不能希望覓得之、今則此種原則、業已作廢矣、職是之故、近年以來借欵所受之危險、實較尋常為甚、蓋自一九二八至二九年、一種國家主義所成立之南京政府、成為中央政府後管理海關稅收之外人行政機關似已為之動搖、監務稽核所、實際已由外人之手轉入華人掌握矣、南京政府成立之前後、內部擾攘、使鐵路整頓或改良事宜、無從着手進行、當時政府處多事之秋、不遑顧及借欵之前途、甚至要求廢止領判權、而使特有中國債券者為之俶擾不安、</p>
<p>幸國民政府經過最初紛擾之時代後、即獲有光明磊落之進步、至於今日、華北將領均服從中央、即意在獨立之廣州政府、經一九三六年九月不流血之革命後今亦不復存在矣、故　政冶而論中國政府今已力能整理其內政、而於財政事務、亦漸轉否為泰此則日本在海濱之肆威、與夫共產黨在內地之跳梁、實有以助成之也、尤可注意者、此二威脅、無一挫弱中政府對外之聲望、甚至日本在華北之強大侵略、似已逆其初志、提早終止、而東京橫暴之軍閥、對於中國之抵抗、亦為之驚駭不置矣、日本向以為彼對中國之經濟發展、當分任指導之責、此種見解、今似須加以更變、一九三五年、日本曾要求中國許其在開於中國對外經濟關係之各事中、佔特殊地位當李資羅斯爵士代表英國財政部至華考察中國之財政時、日本各報、公然發仇對之言論、未幾有成立借欵之議、各報復恣意抨擊不遺餘力、迨一九三五年十一月五日、中政府毅然下令、放棄其自古沿用之銀本位、實行法幣政策日本遂懷疑此舉出於英國財政部與美國之計謀、日本此種恫嚇、終未遏過止中國逐步進行其內國發展之準備、去年中國之整理愆期已久之鐵路借欵計劃、已使中國在海外之信用漸得恢復、中國鐵路債券、於是有復入倫敦市傷之可能、最近一月十二日、在上海發行之滬杭甬鐵路債券、兹果列入倫敦證券交易所矣、斯舉也、或足以覘此間之人心、今後新借欵之接踵成立實意中事耳而英國輸出信用擔保局之特別注意中國市場、遺派代表駐於上海、即足徵明英政府之不復反對中國借欵也、</p>
<p>由此觀之、投資人今已可謂脫離過去十年中之恐慌、而可相信中政府今方努力從事消除中國債券所含危險之主要因素、蓋中政府今日治權所屆之廣、為輓近任何政附所不能及、故已無內部續起紛擾、海關稅欵致被截留之虞、而往日勢若搖動海關安全之過度國家主義、兹亦因中政府表明願將海關仍由外人管理、此種危險、已不復存在、中政府斯舉、實其有特殊力量、因是所獲之信用、為益匪淺、再則中政府之抵拒日本與共產黨之威肋、其堅决出人意料、亦大足增高其信用也、</p>
<p>今日中國之需要厥維賡續進行目前之政策耳、深望蔣委員長仍保有其政府領袖之大權、則此種政策、始可保其賡續、惟工作詳則、仍賴孔財長悉心擘畫、以博取羣衆信任、此亦為一要圖、孔財長上年慘淡經營恢復中國借欵之信用、倫敦金融界皆為稱譽不置、故均望其繼續掌理中國才財政、蓋一九三六年開始之發展、倘得於孔財長領導之下賡續數年、則中國在倫敦繼長增高之信用、必能使中國需且借欵以供其偉大發展之時在倫敦募得之也、即在今日、投資家之握有巨數日本債券者、或已考量不若易其一部份為中國債券之為愈矣、</p>
<h3>漁業銀團調查蘇浙近海漁業狀况</h3>
<p>沈家門年產魚貨千五百萬元　將再往閩粵魯等省沿海調查</p>
<p>實業部與中國交通等十二家銀行合辦之漁業貸欵銀團、成立日期、已經確定於三月一日、其組織規程亦已由第三次籌備會讓通過、正是候實部核示、至於成立時之一切手續連日由籌備委員錢新之·王志莘·蕢延芳·三氏接洽中、屆時並擬請實業部長吳鼎昌氏來滬致訓、辦事處仍設於籌備處原址、聞前由新華等三銀行貸與上海漁市場轉貸冰鮮魚民之借欵十二萬元、已歸還三萬元、其未還之欵、則俟銀團成立時移歸銀團承受、至銀團調查各漁區情况、蘇浙兩省已調查完竣、以後將再派昌赴閩粵魯等省調查、兹特浙海舟山羣島之漁業情况録後、</p>
<p>漁業情形</p>
<p>沈門家位於舟山島之東端、為一漁業中心、居民三千七百餘戶、男女共一萬六干三百餘人、而從事漁業或以漁撈為副業者、約百分之七十至八十蓋該島較大、有農田約六百畝可耕種稻薯及雜糧等、除本地及本省人艮外、並有自閩省等外幫人民前往漁撈、據該地漁棧之估計、年產魚貨约值一千五百萬元、以小黃魚為大宗、约佔百分之三十五、帶魚次之、约百分之二十五、大黃魚鳥贼蟹鰻等又次之、漁戶所得、交由漁棧脫售、或用監製、或傤冰鮮船運往他處、其中以銷售本省各埠者為最多、约佔全數百分之四十銷至蘇省及上海者針百分之二十八粵省上為百分之二十、閩省計百分之十、其他各地計百分之二、</p>
<p>漁民生活</p>
<p>該地漁船、均係舊式、而以張捕小黃魚之大對船為主要工具、數達八百對、補大黃魚之大莆計千一百七十只、紅頭對計千八百對、流網計千二百八十只、張綱二百只釣船五百八十只、漁民每年出漁情形、在中秋節起、自六橫島桃花島而北、張捕小黃魚、小雪節時、至嵊泗列島、捕獲兼魚、迨冬至節時、即返沈家門附近撈捕離魚、至第三年清明前至立夏節時、在嵊泗捕小黃魚、立夏節後至台山長塗捕大黃魚在六七兩月、大都停工修船及補綱、故其生活甚為辛勞、有操作終年面未獲一飽者、</p>
<p>歡迎貸款</p>
<p>漁民經濟困窘異常、故每次出漁、均賴魚樓之資助、而魚棧即仰給於銀行錢荘、以前中國銀行沒有辦事處、在二十三年時放欵约五萬元、甬幫各錢荘放欵甚多、惟自二十四年甬地發生金融風潮、一時收回者達七百二十萬元、而中國銀行亦停行放欵、幸各魚棧資本充裕、故漁業未遭影響、惟其對漁民之條件甚為苛刻、漁民借欵後其獲得之魚貨、必須交魚棧代售、取佣為百分之五、至利息長期每百元為二十五元、短期為月息二分、故各漁民獲悉銀團將以低利貸欵異常欣快、該地有漁業生產合作社一處、社員僅二十餘、從事養殖淡冰魚、但資不不足、成結不佳云、</p>

<h3>貢獻話國貨在舊歷新年</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>習俗在中國社會中，是佔着很大的勢力，我們過着舊歷新年，便深深的感受着他的根深柢固，任何力量，一時不易改變的。我們在這舊歷年中，觀察國貨的出路，却值得一談。</p>
<p>第一是日用品　人家過年時候，少不得要買些日用品物。據中國國貨公司的報告，在年底每天一萬七八千元的營業額中，日用品要佔到三分之一，便可想見日用品銷路的旺盛。我們更據女訪問員的報告，最近各家庭採用日用品時，許多主婦都到國貨公司或國貨工廠中去採辦。不過她們還有些意見，説國貨的品質，固然不差，可是價值還嫌貴些，店員的禮貌還須客氣些，所以今後各廠成本的减低，和公司店員的訓練，倒是一個重要問題。</p>
<p>第二是玩具　舊歷新年中，最足以影響兒童教育的，無過於尊長結兒童以壓歳錢，兒童爲了金錢關係，不惜墮落志氣，向尊長拜年，這種拜金主義的惡習慣，最足以敗壞兒童德性，吾們認爲極應該革除。一天許多教育家集會，主張用玩具來代替壓歳錢，很得到多數人的贊同，恰好項康原先生在座，大家都説請項君多做些兒童玩具出來，供給這舊歷新年的需要。項君説，康元廠願意以大量玩具用廉價方法來應付這許多賢明的尊長，聽説國貨公司中今年玩具的銷路，比往年好得多，以玩具代壓歳錢，可惜吾們還没有宣傳普遍，在明年希望大大提倡一番以矯正這種拜金的通俗。同時還望項君也竭力的多製造些種類，並减低些成本，來造福社會上無數的兒童。</p>
<p>第三是飲食品　新年中的銷耗，食品也佔着多數，僅僅是糕餅糖果，爲數已屬可觀，聽説冠生園生舊歷年中的營業，一個星期中要超出平時一個月的營業額以上，此外各種飲食品的銷路，如南北貨等，多要較平時多出數倍，這些貨物目下可説都是國産。這一點很足以告慰於國人的。</p>
<p>第四是衣着品　新年中人人都喜歡穿新衣，新帽新鞋，尤其是許多小孩，所以衣着品的銷路，也佔着重要部分，吾在除夕一天，到國貨公司中買小孩的罩衫料，和自己的帽子皮鞋，公司中應有盡有，尤其是華福帽的價廉物美，鴻新布的色澤光潔，可以説十分滿意。最後到三友實業社，買了許多小孩用品，以及各地土産物，覺得店員充分的服務精神，可以見到平日訓練的工夫。聽説三友社的郵售部，完全以服務爲職志，各地購户，無論要辦什麽貨品，該社都能照辦，使得用之滿意。吾到三樓時，看見一位店員正在對客揮毫，據説是四川朋友特地來信托寫的。總之，國貨商店能以服務爲營業的出發點，未來的前途，一定是大有希望的。</p>
<h3>新春與國貨</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>韶光易逝，白駒如飛，丁丑牛年，固已接內子鼠年而降臨；今歳新春，亦已隨時序之轉動而接踵以來。當此二十六年新春展臨人間之際，吾人站在提倡國貨，服用國貨之立塲上，對於國貨運動的前途，實抱有無限之熱忱與希望。願伸愚見，以與各界同胞相共勉。</p>
<p>夫新春至矣！吾親愛之男女同胞，在此春光融融，天和日暖的新春期中，對於一切日常生活所需，勢必除舊更新，或全部新購，或酌量購置，此殆爲必然之事。然筆者甚願各界同胞，於購置用品之際，儘可能的多多的購辦國貨，同時，更須懇切，勸導親戚友人，站在一條路綫上共同向着真正推銷國貨的塲合採購，能如是，則新春的國貨運動，定必由諸同胞之努力，而達到現象良佳的地歩。而民族經濟的難關，亦將因國貨事業的發展，而無形中减少其嚴重性矣。</p>
<p>或謂：『予非不容用國貨也，予非不願用國貨也，特今日之國貨出品，在在尚未達到盡善盡美，使人滿意之地歩耳。』噫！此言謬矣。我中國之國貨出品，自經十數年來之努力提倡，其出品之精美，固已較之以往，不可同日而語矣。尤其可喜者，自民國二十二年之國貨年而後，國貨生産界之努力，實有使吾人異常感佩者在。蓋其一切出品，嚴格言之，確已漸漸臻達「第一流國貨」之地位，如三友實業社之棉織品，五洲大藥房之藥用品，中華琺瑯廠之搪瓷用品，五和織造廠之內衣，家庭工業社之化妝品，新亞藥廠之補使命，美亞綢廠之各式綢緞，康元廠之玩具及匣子，凡此種種國貨出品，設與外貨比較，吾人敢斷言，其相差必無幾也。</p>
<p>故當此美麗之新春展臨人間之時，筆者特推荐各種第一流國貨於各位同胞，希望吾同胞不購辦用品則已，否則，願惟國貨是購，惟國貨是辦，設能一致如此，則今歳新春之國貨事業，其前途之發展，庶有豸乎？</p>
<h3>國人新發明</h3>
<p>— 賢</p>
<p>我國留德造紙工程師劉永惠氏，近在特斯頓工業大學造紙研究所中，發明用高粱桿造紙，已得結果極佳，按我國造紙向用竹，稻草，桑皮，破布，蘆葦，舊紙楮皮等爲原料，然竹，稻草，桑皮等原料除閩浙贛三省出産外，全國其他各省所産極少，故原料缺乏，以是紙業未能發達，今若以高粱桿代替之，則華北諸省之高粱桿産量極富，我國自行造紙之原料當不愁乏矣，是項發明直我國貨界今歳第一朶奇葩也。</p>
<h3>關於訪問的幾點意想</h3>
<p>— 周邦俊</p>
<p>國貨訪問座談會</p>
<p>訪問，不是一件平凡的工作，每個訪問員必須備具下列的條件：</p>
<p>第一　須有充分的學識</p>
<p>第二　須有相當的經騐</p>
<p>第三　須有大方的態度</p>
<p>第四　須有流俐的口才</p>
<p>所以訪問員絶不是普通的人才，能擔任這重大的工作，尤其在市塲充滿了舶來的物品，一般人崇拜洋貨的今天，國貨訪問員，更不是一般人所能貿然擔任的工作。</p>
<p>國貨訪問的範圍，似乎過於廣泛，因爲每個訪問員，對於所委托的工廠，不能不有些相當的認識；可是各個工廠的組織不同，出品不同，除非每一件出品都經過試用，都有一點認識，對於訪問時的措詞，不致空洞抽象，而使被訪問者的信仰堅定。要是拾取牙慧，縱能强詞奪理的説得天花亂墜，難免啟人懷疑，而致訪問工作，全部失敗，爲彌補這個缺憾，因此邦俊便想到需要一個座談會，一方請工廠當局來灌輸一些需要的知識，一方來解决訪問時所發生的種種困難。</p>
<p>座談會的重要既如上述，那末今天對於座談會所需要説的話不能不約略的談一談：</p>
<p>第一要注意對象的心理　換句話説，擔任訪問工作的人，要象做保母和小學教師一樣，應當把自己的成見放棄，須要迎合對方的意志，然後用旁敲側擊的方法，來變轉對方的心理；要是不捐除自己的意見，不問别人好惡，結果徒令人厭棄，所以對方萬一是洋貨的崇拜者，就當從洋貨而談到國貨：如其是對國貨熱心提倡者，就當把鑒别方法來告訴，這樣，使對方能够很心意誠服的接受訪問。</p>
<p>第二要避免虚僞的宣傳　國貨很少能站住脚跟，癥結在宣傳的不能忠實，該問員當然是兼有宣傳的任務，就應該注意到這一點。免除虚僞的宣傳，先當對工廠委托的貨品，下一番考察的工作，質料，效用，裝璜，都該有深切的認識，然後於訪問時應對上不致瞠目結舌。或則流於虚僞宣傳，而毁滅了過去工作的成績。</p>
<p>第三要留意對方的環境　被訪問者，未必一定有購買力，或者並不是各個人所需要，而定須使對方接受訪問者之意見，這都是逆道而行，徒令人興不快之感。所以訪問者在到達被訪問者的住宅，先當留意四周的布置，確定了對方的環境。然後計劃訪問的大綱，這樣，才能懷闢入理。要是酷好實用主義者嚴作化妝香品的訪問，那不但失去效力，反令人難堪，這是失却訪問的意義。</p>
<p>第四要迎合時令和需要　夏令而作冬令物品的訪問，這是背時，訪問員固然也能明瞭這一些常識，但是委托工廠或者另有一種必須加入訪問的理由，那末唯有隨機應變。至於被訪問的家庭，如其正在用某一種貨品，這個中心的題材，絶對不能放棄，因爲就這一個材題，便能發揮到自己所要做的文章。或許從舉一反三之中，能够附帶宣傳了别種出品；這對於各工廠都是有利的。</p>
<p>第五不厭求知不避見怪　訪問員未必是萬知萬能，應當利用餘暇，到委托工廠去考查出品的內容，不明即問，每一星期至少作一次向工廠負責人的訪問工作，來增益自己的智識。同時常把被訪問者的批評，去告知工廠當局，比較共同性質而認爲有價值的。報告給會中，給各工廠採納改正。</p>
<p>總之：訪問員的責任是非常重大，訪問員應當備具的智識正多，不是這寥寥的幾句所能包括盡情，好在叙會的機會很多，不妨大家多提出些意見來談談。</p>
<h3>國貨與新春同樂會</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>吾們在七團體主辦之新春同樂會中，所見各國貨工廠之贈品，可以説都是第一流的國貨。盡善盡美，吾可批評。</p>
<p>許多主婦拿到贈品以後，都説這許多國貨，正合吾們理想中的標準國貨，稱爲第一流國貨，誰曰不宜。</p>
<p>許多小孩子拿到國貨贈品以後，尤其稱讚的，是項元製罐廠的玩具。有教育的，有國防的，有科學的，有美感的這般天真活潑的小孩子，拿到以後，皆大歡喜，比了領到壓歳錢，要高興十倍。有人説：以後故尊長的，與其以壓歳錢給小孩，不如以玩具來送子孩，比較有意義，有價值。</p>
<h3>從「以牙還牙」説到國貨牙膏</h3>
<p>— 砥礪</p>
<p>「以牙還牙」這句話的意思，就是要人有抗戰的精神，不要畏怯，不要退讓。</p>
<p>敵人用經濟侵佔的手段來謀我，拿大量的商品來傾銷，假使我們不積極設法應付，不趕快發展我們的國貨，祗任憑敵人的牙咬，那就成了我們的致命傷，我們國家的命脈也要被牠咬斷了！所以我們要保衛我們的國家，我們就要磨利我們的牙齒，因爲牙齒實在是切身最要緊的東西。</p>
<p>健牙的條件必須刷牙，而刷牙的牙膏還必須用國貨，這話可以相提並論。國産的上等牙膏，有五洲藥廠的「一三一牙膏」，係由牙料專家處方，由藥師監製，具有潔齒制酸，殺菌防腐，保護牙磁，等等的藥劑功效，足供使用。</p>

<h3>復安徽舒城民生工廠陳昭一君</h3>
<p>人工脚踏紡紗車在江蘇舊松江屬各縣鄉間，用者頗多，浦東即其例也，其構造主要部分：爲一大輪盤，三紗椗，一踏梗。紡紗者，坐而以二足踏動踏梗，則大輪轉動，於是輪與椗相聯之皮帶亦動，而紗椗隨之以動，椗上引以棉條，拉細成紗，並以大輪踏梗之或停或退，而紗繞於椗，其效率確亦不弱。但使用方法，非實地學習不可，文字實不易説明也。該車純以硬樹製造，價格不出五元，重可三十斤，高可三呎，長可五呎，不能郵寄，至貴處需運費若干，恕難估計，以交通情形不明也。（編者）</p>

<h3>成衣匠的特種責任</h3>
<p>— 加丁</p>
<p>程天放先生是吾國有名的思想家，他曾在他所著的「改革中國學校教育芻議」一文裏竭力的主張「職業學校第一不必分農工商等科，而應該分許多不同的班。社會上需要那一種人，就開那一種班，社會上所不需要的，就不去製就」。譬如成衣匠不是任何城市都有的嗎？爲什麽職業學校不適應社會上的需要開設成衣班呢」「畢業後由學校發給執照」，而由他自己去開設成衣店，或者到人家家裏去做裁縫。他的結論説得好：「這樣造就成的成衣匠一定比現在許多没有受過教育的成衣匠好得多，不但可以做衣服，並且也可以呌他們負起提倡國貨的責任。（因爲許多女太太們的衣服的式樣和質地都是有意無意受成衣匠的影響而定的）。」</p>
<p>筆者深以爲衣是人生重要需求之一，和食住行共相並列；而婦女們對於衣服的需用比男子們更甚，並有相當顧問男子衣着的權力。成衣匠是衣服的專門製造者，雖然未能够做一個明目張膽的僱主的主宰者，可是在無形中却不免是僱主們意識上最要的主動者；通常一般婦女們當做衣服時候，總都喜歡探詢成衣匠關於衣服的式樣和質料等的意見，男子們更不必説；成衣匠們在這個時候，除去盡他們的本身職務的專門技巧的籌劃以外，正是獻身於壯烈的提倡國貨運動最實地的好機會，也是克盡國民一份子愛護國家責任的時刻。正在身爲裁縫司務的人們，請仔細的想想看吧！</p>
<p>倘若是生活上許可的話，吾想一個最善良而精練的成衣匠，一定是非國貨的衣料决不願意替僱主們裁縫的。就是退下一歩而憑些良心來説，成衣匠們當此國難嚴重的時期裏，也得要盡力的誠懇的勸導着僱主們儘量購用國貨衣料等。</p>

<h3>過失</h3>
<p>— （惟際）</p>
<p>過失是人人不能免的。但只要有過必改，即是無過。所謂免過等於過無！</p>
<p>與其謂「日行一善」，何如倡「日改一過」！</p>
<p>每當對自己發現一個過失，就是對自身多一回刺激，也就是多一次奮發自新的機會！</p>
<p>發現過失的次數愈多，人生的經騐積得亦愈多！</p>
<p>不憚改過的人，便是希望成分最濃厚的人。</p>
<p>過失是幚助人生改進的梯階！</p>
<p>肯决心改過的人，比任有或没有過失的人更要好一等！</p>
<p>有常能指出和糾正我過失的人，就是我的益友！</p>
<p>犯了過失而能立刻悔悟，尚不失爲「知過必改善莫大焉」的君子。</p>
<p>有過是一過；不肯認過又是一過。一認則兩過都無，不認則兩過不免。彼强辯以飾非者果何爲也。</p>
<h3>盡情伸義之外交</h3>
<p>— 真相</p>
<p>六十年來日本對華外交，或謂可以「急公利，」「喜夸詐；」二語盡之。（見陳振先於二十一年序第一卷六十年來中國與日本）至於李鴻章式之外交，則仁者見仁，智者見智，總觀百餘萬言全書，亦不能驟作簡賅之定論焉。</p>
<p>近頃偶閲民九葉楚傖氏所作海上本事詩，述賽金花口中李相國之言，令人恍如撥開雲霧，勝讀全部當年對日外交史也。</p>
<p>葉詩云：「樽俎何如床第奇，（飄韵，葉氏註，）春宵燕婉覇圖微。贏君一語成新例，地下知心李合肥。」葉氏於原詩后自附註疏，并錄於下：</p>
<p>「狀元夫人賽金花，飄泊二十年，仍歸海上。友人馬君，亦二十年前海上狂生也。刧後把臂，歡如平生。嘗與縱横論天下事，夫人歎曰：「合肥相國有言：「對外見可許者速許之，以盡吾情；不可許者即拒之，以伸吾義；事無不可爲者。」今之居壇坫親樽俎者，既不肯許，又不能拒，此國之所以敗也。」噫！折衝之才，乃鄙夷乃於女倡，可哀已！」</p>
<p>客歳賽金花逝世，友人談葉楚傖氏於民六作儀鑾殿傳奇，今日似可補續完成云。</p>
<h3>黑人之美</h3>
<p>— 立平</p>
<p>黑人心目中的美人，第一個條件是要皮膚來得黑，而且黑得要發光，才呌做美，所以黑種女子用椰子油週身來塗，就是這個原故，其次眼睛是要愈小愈好，唇却要厚，鼻扁平得像一塊餅，這些都是美的條件。</p>
<p>黑人對於頭髮，也是極其注意，並且你可以從髮中看出伊們是已婚或未婚的女子。已婚的往往把頭髮剃成一個像碗底樣子的輪形，用樹膠膠成筍尖形。未婚的是把頭髮分也數辮，膠成筆形，這個樣子，他們是認爲美的。</p>
<p>女子的面上有瘢痕，黑人不特不以爲不美，而且認定這是美容術上萬不可缺少的，在面部特地用人工刺花，瘢痕等，而且還着色，各種都有，但以紅色最受他們的歡迎。</p>
<p>黑人對於衣服是素來不注意的，通常他們祗有一條小小的腰裙，但有一點奇怪，黑種女子的頸項上，往往用一種布帶纒繞着，據説這樣可增頭部的長度，是有莫大的魔力的。</p>
<h3>鬥雞</h3>
<p>— 惠波</p>
<p>我的故鄉——河南，是有着鬥雞的風氣的。它盛行的時間：是在農閒的臘月天起，至來年一月止。在這時期，小孩子們一個個的抱着要留着祭竈君老爺的雄雞，找他們的對手。</p>
<p>鬥雞時没有什麽條件，只要對手們遇到一起，便把自己的雄雞丢開，讓它和對方鬥。雞雖雄壯，究非人類可比，所以雖是趾高氣揚，惟我獨尊的樣子；但終不會大喝一聲「反賊看刀」或「順我者生，逆我者死」，只不過四目一對，相相的張開翅膀，伸出鐵嘴利距，一來一往的鬥了起來。鬥勝者，便一鳴驚羣（雌雞之羣），赫赫的獨覇一方，不幸而敗，則抱頭遠竄。</p>
<p>關於它們的鬥，自然有許多原因：爲了要佔有這裏所有的雌雞，爲了要顯出自己的威風，也許還有别的道理？</p>
<p>看鬥雞的人們，都是爲了興趣。覺得一縷縷的雞毛從對方口裏啄出來；一滴滴的鮮血，落在地上，落在羽毛上。甚而一隻雪白的雞，會染上一層桃色，爲鬥爭完全變了本像，然而它只不過給愛看熱鬧的小孩子誇耀兩句，撫摸一下。人們真正喜歡的，則是美麗，雄壯，勤於打鳴（即呌曉），不到野外亂跑的雞。小心的保護它們，不讓惡嘴雞來傷害。</p>
<p>所以我想：雞最好也立一個學校，教他點知識，使他明白自己的任務。不過這一定會被愛看熱鬧的小孩們所反對的。</p>
<h3>牛話</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>今年是牛年，我們也來談談牛。</p>
<p>在十二生肖之中，最有用的，生活最苦的，最受人類欺侮虐待的，而同時，也最是努力圖存的，只有牛馬二者。而更其是牛的貢獻，似乎比了馬，尤爲偉大，因爲在古代，馬雖在國防上，佔着重要的地位，但因着現代戰術的進歩，馬的重要性日减，農業，雖然也有日趨於機械化之勢，然在我國的農業界中，牛的勞力，還是不可少。至於其他值年的十種動物，都是自鄶以下，不足論矣。</p>
<p>牛的對於人類的貢獻，不只是可以利用其勞力，爲耕田之用，同時，牛乳，牛肉，牛油，牛髓，都是人類絶好的滋養料。而牛皮，牛骨，更都是工業用品中的無上妙品。牛的勞力，可助人類的生産，牛的乳，肉，可供人類的滋養，牛皮等等，更可供工業的製造，牛對於人類的貢獻，如此偉大，但是牛的消費，却是低於一般的動物。吃的是草乾，豆餅，以及不用花錢的野生的青草。住的是屋後的棚欄，冬受寒侵，暑受日炙。但是人類對之，是絶對的没有絲毫的同情，驅使着，鞭韃着，待到衰老病死了，還得享以一刀，而臠割其尸體，剔除其皮骨，以資牟利。但是牛是自知努力圖存的，每一條牛，似乎先天的都已知道着，在這世界上，惟努力，乃能生存。所以那個沉重的身子，總是努力地前進，雖然是喘着氣了，還是用着最後的一口氣，跨着最後的一歩。</p>
<p>從牛的生活方式中，我是覺得我們中國，在有些所在，是太像牛了。瞧哪，取之無盡，用之不竭的寳藏，可不是活像牛的乳，肉，皮革，無一廢物麽？而國內的低廉的人工，國人耐勞的習性，在外人的眼光中瞧來，簡直是和使用牛力，一樣的便宜而有效。華僑的到處受人排擠，便是一個很好的事實證明。而我們中國，在這弱肉强食的世界中人雖然到處爲人類造幸福，所得的報酬，只是歧視排擠，甚至於遭人的屠殺，蹂躪，那是多麽可悲呢？然而雖然我們所得的報酬，是如此，可是我們還是這麽的埋頭苦幹着，推進着這個世界的文化，絶不畏怯，絶不自餒。這種精神，又是多麽地偉大呀？</p>
<p>但是中國與牛，雖然是那麽的相似，可是牛，究竟是牛，中國，究竟是中國。雖然牛是任人榨取，任人斬割，我們中國人，現在是醒覺過來了，榨取宰割。現在是不再容許的了。我們有的是，牛一般的富藏，牛一般的努力，牛一般的生活的認識，但是我們還有不是牛所具有的智識。我們將把牛所具有的，與牛所没有的一切長處，打成一片，助成新中國的完成。—這是在這個牛年中，我人所當自行警惕的。</p>
<p>我們究竟不是牛，我們是不容人來榨取，宰割的！</p>

<p>夢蘭鼻子裏哼了一聲，笑道：二嫂你可以説是一個女蘇秦了。二少奶道：你這話怎講？我不懂。你可别同我搬骨董。夢蘭道：你不會不懂的，這就是説是六國封相的那個人。二少奶笑着點了幾點頭道：哦哦哦？我明白。你是不是寃枉我，我且不説。你怎見得我就是個女蘇秦呢？夢蘭道：你先送我幾盆菊花，讓我高興。跟着你上樓來慢慢和我閑談。談來談去，就可以把你要説的話談出來了。你此來，不但是你的意思，母親也很知道，所以特地泡了一壺茶給我們兩個人喝。二少奶端着杯子喝了一口茶，笑道：妹妹，你太聰明了。夢蘭笑道：是不是一猜就猜着了。二少奶穿了一件藍色的短湖縐夾襖，窄窄的袖口上，套了兩隻金鐲子，越發是現出來他的肌肉豐滿。他不端茶杯的手，可不時的抬起來，去扶理他的鬢髮。他圓圓的臉子，兩個大眼睛，倒現出一點忠厚相來。見夢蘭只管望他，才笑道：妹妹，你説你話：可不寃枉死好人嗎？我向來就是這樣想，你終日總是這樣愁眉不展，要想法子替你解悶才好，你大嫂還嫌着我多事呢。我爲什麽還要替你加上煩惱呢？你説母親和我事先約好了，那更不對。你這個精靈鬼，有事要瞞你還瞞不了呢，母親肯在你面前露出馬脚來嗎？夢蘭道：但是這茶葉，的確是母親屋子裏的儲藏品。二少奶放下茶杯，兩手拍着，金鐲子是嘎咜一下嚮。因笑道：正是母親屋子裏的茶葉呀。他能够這樣大大方方送好茶你我喝，那才是一點假意都没有呢。夢蘭端了那杯茶，慢慢的呷着，也呷乾了。杯子還拿在手上，只管顛倒的看着。二少奶笑道：妹妹，你仔細想想，我到底是不是女蘇秦？夢蘭笑道：算我説錯了，你不要見怪。二少奶笑道：我只有可憐你的分兒，我那會怪你。夢蘭笑道：我也是中産以上人家的大小姐，你爲什麽可憐我？二少奶被他這句話頂着，倒不好怎樣的答復，看到那把茶壺，還放在桌上，就把壺拿起來，先斟了一杯。然後又把夢蘭的茶杯子接了過來，也斟了一杯遞給了他，笑道：這茶味還不錯，你再喝一杯罷。（一三四）</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>明日的美國</h3>
<p>— 黄宇楨</p>
<p>美國的風俗，習慣，和一切的現代社會組織，都是科學化似的。當我初到美國的時候，處處覺得吃緊和興歎！但以普通城市而論，亦如上海聖誕前夜的霞飛路，或是禮拜六的南京路。行人，汽車，以及各項的交際往返，處處急忙得要命。住屋和機關內的設備，也是我們在上海的洋房，和公司裏面所看到的情形一樣。但是美國人的進取，和改革，確是異常敏捷。所以一般預言家，常常預卜將來的美國，不是翻雲造極，便是盡地腐爛。</p>
<p>有一次我曾聽了一位美國社會心理學家，貝爾尼博士Dr.　Mj-Bume的演講他由現在美國的社會心理，推到將來的進歩，很覺得有味。現將他的論調，據我所能記憶的，略爲介紹：</p>
<p>（一）交通與轉運：他説美國將來的街道，一定是有兩層面，上下都可以通車。爲了都市土地價值昂貴起見，街中的小巷，將如現今的大馬路一樣，可以往來電車。街道上設標號，以警惕轉運衝突；定徒歩規則，以保護行者性命。交通繁盛區域，設地下歩道。馬路將分三層；第一層通電車，第二層，通輕快汽車，醫生車等；第三層，爲徒歩往來的人。三層都可自由升降。所以上層的人，可至下層，下層的人，亦有同樣的自由。將來的飛機，可以在路上行走，又可飛動自如。在城市中心的地方，或是天台上，都有飛機降下的塲所。每若干里，有機站之設立，以利飛行，並可隨意向街道上前進，如同現今的汽車一樣。人可隨便乘飛機旅行全世界。這種飛機裏面的設備，確如輪船內的設備一樣：有房間，有餐室，有閲報所，有吃烟處，有無綫電台。飛機在産業上的用處，將來還要活動。商業方面，郵政方面，航駛方面，都將大用飛機，縱横洋海，冶遍世界。輪船，火車，汽車的開駛，都將化用電力。速度增加，將計輪船，每分鐘八英哩；火車每分鐘十七英哩；汽車每分鐘——英哩。現在街道上所僱用的轉運工具，如汽車，自動車，街車，機器脚踏車等，一律要以電力來駕駛。</p>
<p>（二）建築與設備：瓦面，牆璧，將要用銅製造。地板，樓柱，將要用堅厚玻璃建築。門把，用具，將要用銀鎳做成。住宅屋宇的天台，都將設有花園。街道中，將設有小公園，以便行人隨意觀賞。所有商店，樓房，都將備有冰喉，熱喉，這種供氣公司，或由商辦，或由國營，有如今日的電燈，自來水公司一樣。氣候的冷暖，都可以絶對調和。現在家庭中洗衣，洗碗，花了不少的人工，和時間，將來也要改用電氣。這種機件，有如今日的掃地機一樣。一切汚穢的衣件，碗碟等，都可放在電爐內，由機械動力，去洗乾净。電話可以打到空中飛機上的人，開駛時汽車上的人，或火車上的人。</p>
<p>（三）學校與家庭：教授，將改成演講，用播音機的方法，使許多人可以聽。要讀書的人，只要裝一架播音機，用不着到學校裏去，所以將來的教育，一定是要變成極端平民化的。家庭，將變成旅館方式一樣，只有安適的寄宿所和一切美的設備。家中烹飪，一定會消滅。吃飯的時候，不是到餐館，便是將食品買回來，因爲什麽食用品，都可由别人燒好，做好，包好，如同現今所購買的麵包一樣。婚姻必須實行試婚手續。結婚不限國界，不拘種族，世界大同，必將實現。</p>
<p>這些論調，是照貝爾尼博士推測出來的。恐怕不久的將來，美國的社會文化，真要如此實現，因爲美國人的進取，好奇，改革的心理，比較世界什麽種族，都要鋒鋭！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>組織義務警察隊</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>昨見報載，松江縣政府，為充實地方自衛力量，曾有組織義務警察隊之擬議，前經一度召集會議，進行籌備，隊員均以初中以上畢業而有正當職業或有恒產者為合格，隊長縣長兼，副隊長警察局長兼。此種制度，是否遵照省辦理，抑為該縣的創舉，余尚未知，但此種辦法，余於二三十年前，即有此意，共所以發動該項辦法的理由，原很簡單，蓋一地方的治安，全靠幾個警察與地方軍隊來維持，是萬萬靠不住的，一地方的洽安，只有一地方的人民自己起來維持，方能奏效。</p>
<p>更擴大一些言之，不但地方如此，即國家何嘗不如此，一個國家，祇有國民大家起來維持，若全靠國家軍隊來維持，恐還是不够，所以地方義務警察的組織，小之可以衛持一地的治安，大之即可以維治一國的治安。故語曰“若要穩固，必須自做；”又曰：“自力更生”。若一個國家專依賴他國為救星，則共國必亡，蓋縱橫捭闔之策，只能於偶一時期行之，相當有效，而決不能認為是萬應良方。國家強弱的原理，本來如此，而處現在的環境中，更應該把此意發揮而廣大之，立國之道在此，立身安家之道亦在此。</p>
<p>自法西斯主義盛行，而主張正義主張和平的國家，乃日處於弱肉強食的地位，面無以自拔，不得已惟有大家一致起來擴張軍備，充實武力，以挽回頹勢。蓋處現在的潮流，非武裝不足以言和平，惟武裝乃可以希望和平，其理甚昭著也。故語曰：“殺以制殺，殺乃可止”。愛因斯坦先生，是一個非戰主義者，但是現在他告訴朋友，説：非戰主義，現在已經沒有用處了，現在你們只有贊助戰爭，幫忙戰爭。國家是人民所積而成，若人民自己先登在青龍頭上看相殺，而不肯去效命疆場，總是沒有辦法，故欲國家之強，先要人民自強：欲維持地方之治安，先要維持一國之治安：欲維治一國之治安，先應將此制推行於全國，蓋此種制度推行於一縣，則一縣受共益，推行於一省，則一省受其益，推行於全國，則全國受其益，是義務警察之制，應當全國賓行，不但僅行於一縣一鄉而已。</p>
<h3>財神夜</h3>
<p>— 划</p>
<p>這一天，他們六個子，很早很早就把肚子草草地塞了一些，準備來作一次好賣買。</p>
<p>他們六個子，整整的忙了一天；趙麻子那裏借了十元印子錢，五福維揚大戲院裏借了件大紅袍，一套鑼鼓，這還算是劉大塊頭的面子呢，要不然，向那裏去借？</p>
<p>劉大塊頭，身材高大，臉又端正，他們呌他做財神·他臉上塗滿了金粉，只剩兩雙眼，一個嘴，身上穿了那件大紅袍，腳上着了一雙靴，手裏拿了兩隻金元寶，這樣，他已是位財神爺了</p>
<p>趙阿大，會説吉利話，他穿了件長衫，手裏拿了個方盤，盤裏放的就是趙麻子的十塊錢，他們想：他們這樣做，人們看見都是整塊的法幣，也許自己知道不能開消得大少，他們因此而發橫財。另外的打起鑼鼓，跟在後面。</p>
<p>他們后面跟了一羣湊熱鬧的孩子們。</p>
<p>劉大塊頭像發狂一般地飛奔到一家還算像樣的大店裏去，跳東跳西做了一翻“戲”？接着，趙阿大陪了笑臉上去説：“先生，財神爺把元寶送來了。恭喜恭喜。”</p>
<p>那個“先生”很吝鄙的，祇丟下幾個銅子。</p>
<p>“先生，陞高些，財神爺接來了，不在乎。”</p>
<p>“拿了去吧，這樣已來了六次了，呌我怎樣開消？年份不好啦”</p>
<p>“先生，陞高些，一年一次。”</p>
<p>終於多拿了六個銅子，很不滿的去了。</p>
<p>第二家門上是大律師清理的通告。有第三家呢，他們想。可是第三家的門上貼着一副春聯，上面這樣寫，“實行新生活，廢除舊習慣。”</p>
<p>他們想他們難道連財神也不要了嗎？</p>
<p>夜漸漸的淡了，他們懷着滿腔的希望之火，一家一家的探過去，想滿足他們的慾望。</p>
<h3>父與女</h3>
<p>— 納</p>
<p>太陽光透過了潮濕的霧氣，又重新降到這龐大的村子。</p>
<p>全條街像一絛眠囂，沉沉的躺臥着，像脚爪似的兩旁擠了约十一二家小商鋪。商鋪的門板，從第一家起被慢慢的拉開，小伙計懶散的伸出頭去，互相訊問着。忽然有一個消息從菜仔店那邊傳遞過來，馬上又被清早的主顧帶走，像一陣風暴似的流遍全村子的茅舍和椰園。</p>
<p>第一個帶着這消息來的，是一個老婆子，她像嚼糖菓一樣有興趣的説道：</p>
<p>“開開門吧，大嫂！”我想：是什麽人呀？那兒有這樣大早天來敲門撞戶的，於是便打從窗子伸出頭去，那時天還沒亮，看不清是什麽人。</p>
<p>“你是什麽人，有什麽事？”我大聲</p>
<p>“我們底波羅蕊茜沒來吧，她在夜半從我底屋子不見了。……”答的是一個熟識的聲音。</p>
<p>“沒來！沒來！”我知道他是什麽人，我答了，心想：這個小妮子除了跟人跑，不會離開她屋子的，你們要知道她底爸爸限制她多麽嚴啊！但是我沒説出，我怕傷了這老頭子的心。……</p>
<p>這個不幸的老頭被全街的人想起來了。他在這時已走遍了全村，感到了又悲哀又疲乏，就躲在家裏哭。</p>
<p>三年前他還是一個趕車人，不知怎的，他忽然感到世界的末日已經到了，在那時人類不分貧窮都要上帝的燐火燒燬的。於是，他就賣掉他的馬和車，喝光了。醉時他就光着頭，亦起腳，在街上揚手，蹂脚，滿嘴濺着白沫，大聲呌嚷：“末日的裁判就要來了，弟兄姊妹！末日的裁判就要來了。……”</p>
<p>於是，在他底朦朧的醉眼裏，他就會看見上帝的燐火怎樣在燒燬這村子的茅屋和田園，人類如何遭受末日的裁判。因為這樣，他時常遭受人們底戲弄，好事的青年把他反剪着手，拖到自來水龍頭邊去，用冷水從頭頂淋下，村長也因此常常罰他去坐牢房。</p>
<p>“一切人都對我懷敵意，他們侮弄，毆打我。朋友，眞的，他們會拿一切能想得到的災害給我。”</p>
<p>對一切生人他這樣訴説着，衰老的眼睛溢住感傷的涙珠。</p>
<p>據説他也曾有過好日子過，那時他有三個女兒，雖然老婆子早死了，但他們底日子是幸福的，不久他底第一個女兒因了戀愛自殺了，第二個女兒跟一個椰子商人不聲不息的跑了，從此他們底生活也就被蒙上一重厚厚的陰影。</p>
<p>對第三個已經長成了的女兒，他施行了一種驚人的，嚴厲監視行為。</p>
<p>“她，一個挺不幸的孩子，從十三歲那年起他就靠着自己一雙小手指去討生活了。但是，我不願她這樣下去，踏她姊姊踏過的路，我要使她過像樣點人底生活。……”</p>
<p>於是，他禁止她去參加各種集會，斥退向她求愛的青年男子；但是，當他一醉時，她却會像影子似的從他身邊閃開，立刻投進另一個茅舍裏去，在那兒有雨雙強健的胳膊在等待她。直到他被人拖到自來水龍頭過冷水浴時，他就用手拭去頭上的水珠，像一隻公雞似的搖擺着，跑遍椰園，熟人的茅舍，把她找出來了，就做着非常生氣的樣子：</p>
<p>“我要敲斷你底腿子，賤人！你知道自己已經犯罪了嗎？這，上帝不允許的。……”</p>
<p>女兒流着涙，一句也不説。</p>
<p>“答應我，以后再這樣做了。……”</p>
<p>她微點着頭，總算答應了。於是，他就對天劃著十字，嘴裏念著懺梅詞，她也服樣做了一遍，他才像放下重負似的嘆息道：“好！現有你自由了！”</p>
<p>他這樣做着幾年像一天的過去，但是終於他失收了，她被有力的胳膊，從他身邊引開了。</p>
<p>午後，這個不幸的老人，又像往前一樣的在街上出現，他醉了，光頭，赤足，背着肯袋，手中拄著一根多節的木杖，佝着背走，背後跟著一天羣人向他大聲呌唬，丟石塊，用拳頭威脅，但他像沒有那麽一回事似的，顧着自己底路走。</p>
<p>“異，你要那兒去了”，有人大聲向他呌着。</p>
<p>“到另一個世界去，因為這兒是孤獨的。……”</p>
<p>説罷，他頭也不回的走出村去，棕橺樹蔭，像一雙黑翅膀把他吞沒了。</p>
<h3>糾紛</h3>
<p>— 平君</p>
<p>駐站海關稽查員傅長明，把他所以保持獨身主義的原因告訴我後，便又扯到其他問題上面。他俯在我底耳邊，親暱地説？“你們車站就是壞在没有外國人，像我們海關就不同了。”</p>
<p>他説話的態度很不雅觀，雖然據説是受過中等教育。時常夾着太多的“嗄”字，和英語的單宇，但語。這樣，使人對於一個有趣的值得討論的問題也會感到煩倦的。</p>
<p>在那雜亂的無修飾的談話裏，他還提及歐美人底太晚的結婚，“外國人在三四十歲結婚是很普遍的事，英皇愛德華八世不是一個很好的例子麽？”</p>
<p>我把這些話告訴給大家聽，尤其是着重“車站没有外國人”的那句話。行李司事由西人郭伯祥第一個跳了起來。</p>
<p>“媽的，整個的中國都是壞在那批凖漢奸手上，中國機關用外國人……！洋奴，打倒——”</p>
<p>電報生陳克，他底行動狡猾，陰險，而且很毒得像一尾野狼一樣，把郭伯祥拖到外邊，唧唧噥噥地説了半天話。</p>
<p>在一個偶然的口角裏，受了慫恿的郭伯祥和傅長明打起來了。</p>
<p>“你有本事，去打××人去。”</p>
<p>傅長明底身體瘦削短小，皮膚因爲蒼白而起了許多褐黄的斑點，細小的眼睛泛着灰惘而無神的色澤，四肢五官都患着發育不完全的病態。受不住那山西漢子底蠻勁，跌倒牆脚下了。把他底瘦得祇剩皮和骨的手掌掩住鼻子，像纔生育下來的小貓受小鉅大的創傷似的，發着如上的柔弱的幽幽的聲音。</p>
<p>這是一件很值得心理學家去研究的事情吧：一個有誇大狂的，氣量淺窄的，自私的脚色，在大庭廣衆中出醜後的心理是怎樣的。</p>
<p>於是，有一個多星期，没有人瞧見他張開嘴笑過。</p>
<p>然而，陳克底毒辣的手段又顯示給大家看了。他撫着傅長明底瘦削臂膊，説道：“你底不幸，在我們眞是認爲憾事的，不過，你要原諒，因爲我們底站長不是外國人。”</p>
<p>那矮小的被侮辱者在蒼白色的臉孔上，裂開一絲慘淡的苦笑。”</p>
<p>“嗄，no　fear嗄，有本事的去打，打嗄……”</p>
<p>這個難以下台的局勢，在我拖他出去散步的時候給解除了。</p>
<p>我們沿着軌道默默地走着。</p>
<p>火車咆哮地掠過原野。——空氣很吵雜，囂擾，騷動，有如一隊騎兵突然出現了偷襲的姿態。但立刻地，靜穆以一種撲滅亂萌的手腕，把一切騷擾迅速地又歸入於平靜。</p>
<p>傅長明底生活眞是單調得太可憐，下班後，他不懂得怎樣去我用那餘剩的有限的時光，而把許多寶貴的時光浪費在渴酒，賭博，逛窟子（雖然怕祇有一次吧）上面。這樣，他底性格就變成暴燥的，自私的，愚蠢的，執拗的，猜忌的，貪婪的，………</p>
<p>他把很快地就和郭伯祥恢復了友誼的情形告訴我：</p>
<p>“老郭是老實人。”</p>
<p>打了架三天後，渴醉了的山西人把一口酒嘔在他底身上，説：“我們都是好朋友呀，出門人在外靠朋友呢，陳克譏笑我是包膿，説我打不過你，現在，我已經做給他看了”。</p>
<h3>性命</h3>
<p>— 回生</p>
<p>“性命交關”，這是上海的一句俗話，就是説性命危險的意思。</p>
<p>譬如有一個人，因為起居不謹慎，生了重病，後來奉虧好了，別人問他患病的經過，他便要説：“性命交關！”</p>
<p>性命是最寶貴的，而疾病卻要危害性命！所以人如有病，無論輕重。都要趕快服用有效的藥劑。否則不但“性命交關，并且要“送了性命”，豈不可嘆！</p>
<p>有效的藥劑到那裏去買呢？這不用我多説，當然五洲大藥房的出品，是最靠得住的。五洲家用良藥三百種，種種靈騐，患者對症購服，就不怕“性命交關”了。</p>
<h3>小故事（三則）</h3>
<p>— 璐</p>
<p>都害咳嗽</p>
<p>這兩天，西北風刮得很緊，張家婆害咳嗽，李家奶也害咳嗽，吳家大叔説：“快買一瓶‘麥液止咳露’來吃吧，吃了保險你們的咳嗽就會止住呢。”（止咳露五洲出品）</p>
<p>疼瘡好了</p>
<p>小弟弟因爲每天早上要去上學，脚上起了凍瘡，紅腫痛癢，眞是難過！後來他父親從五洲藥房買凍瘡藥給他擦了，他的凍瘡便很快的好了。</p>
<p>經濟美容</p>
<p>大姊化了四角錢，到五洲藥房去稱了一磅“美容霜”，拿回家來裝來了兩大罐，足够全家人半年使用，所以人都説他是經濟美容家。</p>

<p>明和陳克底裂隙，據説是有一次傅長明　娼了，而這個秘密給陳克發現出來，并且，暴露給大家曉得。於是，死冤家便結成功了。</p>
<p>“有些苦修行的僧侣，偶然也會開一次暈的。要一個獨身主義者，永遠没有一次例外行動，我們不足太苛求了麽？”陳克幽默地説。他底微妙的敘述往往給那故事底本身增加不少的趣味。……</p>
<p>我們又回到車站上來。傅長明擺了一下我底手，似乎是結束地道：“總之，陰謀啊，我們底國民性就是壞在陰謀上”。</p>
<p>他底短視使他底觀察失敗了。——我們底共同的敵人底陰謀，爲什麽不會發現呢？我們受着别人底重大的侵侮，爲什麽不覺得痛恨呢？</p>
<p>但，那自私的傢伙對於地底錯誤始終是不肯“悔過”的。</p>
<h3>夢</h3>
<p>— 孔方</p>
<p>夢是美的，夢的希望是亮的，夢的境地是鮮明的，我喜歡夢，我也常常做夢。</p>
<p>白天，對現寶的不滿和憤怒充塞了我的胸腔，竟使我透不過氣來，白天我就是這樣窒息地過着的。</p>
<p>可是在黑夜，我開始向夢里去找尋甜蜜了，我夢着的世界是理想的，那里沒有悲衷，也沒有煩惱，祇是幸福和歡欣充滿著整個的境地；那里沒有貧窮和富貴，也沒有勞苦和安逸，祇是各人在儘自己的力。我在那里會忘記了現實，但有一次我記起了，於是我驚奇地説：</p>
<p>“這世界和別一個是怎樣地不同啊？”</p>
<p>“這是夢的世界。”有人回答。</p>
<p>“怎樣才建造起這世界的呢？”</p>
<p>“用血和肉。”</p>
<p>“血和肉？”我不信，低下頭一看，啊？這地竟是血肉的結晶。抬起頭，啊？那建築，那高樓，竟都是血……肉…</p>
<p>於是我驚醒了。</p>
<p>我奇怪着我的夢。</p>
<p>也許別人會笑我這夢，但由他笑吧：世界上誰不在做夢呢！我還得勇敢地進行我自己的夢的。</p>
<p>雖説夢或許祇是個夢，但夢是一切的母親，沒有夢的時候，也就沒有了世界。</p>

<h3>一九三七年式新車安全設備舉要</h3>
<p>— 陵韻</p>
<p>制動器機力瀰漫效用最大　其他設備均力求安全保障</p>
<p>一九三七年式新汽車之特色。本刊巳屢有紀載。舉共犖犖大者。如駕駛之便捷。機力之瀰漫。及乘坐舒適。式樣華美等是。但共中尚有最關重要之一點。為汽車使用者所萬不能忽視者。是即新車在安全方面之最大努力。而獲得更完美之成績是也。我人對於汽車之價值。及其用途之繁廣。固已不必多所詞費·不過任何人於購置汽車後。其所行之里程。奚止數百萬里。在此長途之進行中。或為業務上之使用。或為遊樂燕息而驅馳。用途縱儘有不同。欲求其忠實之服務。則人同此心。心同此理。殊為明顯。於是駕禍事件之發生。不僅為車主所痛心疾首。抑亦非制造廠所樂聞。然而肇禍事件之發生。簡不絕書。報章之紀載。將罄南山之竹。果何為乎面來哉。製造方面之失察歟。人事上之過失歟。</p>
<p>各汽車製造廠鑒往察來。知此問題之繁複。欲求解决。非咄嗟可辦之事。乃於其應盡之責職上。更作最精密之推敲。俾新車在各方面之發展上。安全一層亦獲得相當之價值。故一九三七年新車問世後。若謂能擔保肇禍事件之不發生。此固讕言。不值一笑。但新車於機械結構方面。共努力於安全設施之程度。確有長足之進步。苟能善為之用。於駕駛上不背合理化之原則。則肇禍事件得以减少防止。要非不可及之事。是固儘在人為。不可一概而論也。關於新車安全之大要。有如左紀。</p>
<p>車胎爆發。雖非巨禍。但若駕駛失措。而倉猝間發生此類不幸事件者。車胎爆發固非不能誘致不堪設想之橫逆者。比年來叨得化學家研究思考之功。胎製造力求精進。此類事件乃成僅聞矣。制動器為汽車行駛安全上之命脤。此器而失效。則禍事之發生。似有十就九成之概。其重要有如是者。一九三七年式新車之制動器。莫不精強堪用。惟力是視。變起肘腋。應付裕如。大有收之毫末。放之六合之意。故車行而不過速者。一遇需要。大力立至。車即屹然不動。安若泰山矣。車行之間。苟欲立即增速。則預儲之大量機力為不可少。此固稍窺機械學者類能道之。新車對於此固。一如大衆所期。所儲之機力。無不讕漫充沛。儘量加速所不敢辭。車頂為全車之至尊。舉萵瞰下。須具大力。自不待言。今新車頂全係堅靱之金屬所製造。其任重之力量。視全車之重量高且數倍。某廠家為顯示其新車之車頂堅固起見。嘗在其樣車上建造一農家之小屋。居然礎基穩固。不同凡響。見者異之。</p>
<p>汽車使用者其所冀希於新車者。新車似已一一敬遵台命。顧客所弗欲者。製造廠必擯除之。顧客所冀砍者。製造廠必羅致之。此新車之所以能悉如人意也。車行時之不快意的聲息、以及引擎動作之雜聲等。非乘客所喜者。兹已一一排除之矣。為安全起見。制動器之力量。如前述之必須鉅大。今各廠亦一一踵行之矣。一片式之堅鋼車身。為安全乘坐之大保障。更好之均勻勢。及彈簧縣置。業已風行一時。此同乘坐上舒適與否。關係綦火。兹者新車之秉坐者。成無異坐於安樂椅而行之通衢也。車之中心重力現亦移下。俾車行時能格外貼伏路面。安全玻璃。一稱不粉碎玻璃。各車已視為必要之標準設備。（未完）</p>

<h3>The "Clear Diplomacy" of the Hayashi Cabinet Towards China</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>When the Hayashi Cabinet of Japan was established on the first of this month, it originally appointed Ambassador to the United States Saito Hiroshi as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Before Saito could return to Japan to take office, Prime Minister Hayashi temporarily acted as his proxy. Now, Saito has indicated that he will not take the position, and the new cabinet has not considered new candidates for Minister of Foreign Affairs. Since the organization of cabinets in Japan, the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs has almost always been held by professional diplomats. There have only been a few instances where non-professional diplomats have held the position, and they were mostly prime ministers concurrently serving as foreign ministers. According to research by Professor Cooley Grove of the United States, cabinets where the foreign minister is not a professional diplomat generally do not last long. (See the American Journal of International Law Quarterly, published in January of this year.) Whether the Hayashi Cabinet, with the Prime Minister concurrently serving as Foreign Minister, can escape Professor Cooley Grove's prediction remains to be seen. Let us not discuss these larger and more distant matters, but instead analyze the diplomatic policy towards China announced by Hayashi, who also serves as Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>In the diplomatic speech delivered by Hayashi, who also serves as Foreign Minister, in the Diet on the 15th, although it touched on various aspects, the most important part was naturally the policy towards China. The diplomacy of Hayashi, who also serves as Foreign Minister, towards China is the so-called "clear diplomacy." The meaning of "clear diplomacy," in the words of Hayashi, who also serves as Foreign Minister, is: "The people of the two countries should cultivate harmonious feelings and strive for the clarity of national relations, joining hands to achieve stability in East Asia. ... Both sides should strive to understand the other's position, not only the governments but especially to stimulate contact between the people, in order to promote the practical achievements of Japanese-Chinese cooperation and assistance. At the same time, if there are obstacles, they should be removed." This "clear diplomacy" sounds much more pleasant than Hirota's Three Principles on the surface. In particular, Prime Minister Hayashi's responses to questions from Diet members are most likely to arouse the illusions of general "enlightened people." For example, when Prime Minister Hayashi responded to Sakatani Yoshio's question in the House of Peers, he said, "Japan does not want to invade North China, and when such an opportunity arises, it will do its best to dispel misunderstandings." Also, in the House of Representatives, when responding to Uehara's question, he said, "Japan has not only repeatedly expressed its non-aggression towards China, but will reiterate this when the opportunity arises. I fully sympathize with you in thinking it is necessary to recognize the new situation in China." These words are all sweet honey on the surface, but their core is full of venomous meaning. We do not need to cite many reasons to explain this. Just looking at the confession of the Domei News Agency is enough. The Tokyo dispatch of the Domei News Agency on the 16th, after quoting Hayashi's, who also serves as Foreign Minister, speech, "... at the same time, if there are obstacles to Sino-Japanese cooperation, they should be removed," went on to explain, "These words indicate that the Hayashi Cabinet's policy towards China is based on goodwill efforts, but in order to achieve this goal, it is determined to implement forceful measures." This means that the first step in Japan's policy towards China is to demand that the Chinese government and public sweep away the anti-Japanese sentiment. Then, it will proceed to demand the resolution of various outstanding cases. If there is a force in our country that hinders this resolution, Japan will not hesitate to take forceful measures to eliminate it. From the confession of the Japanese news agency, we can clearly understand the aggressive meaning contained in the "clear diplomacy" of the Hayashi Cabinet towards China and should not entertain any illusions.</p>
<p>The aggressive policy of the Hayashi Cabinet towards China can certainly be inferred from the diplomatic speech of the Foreign Minister. It can be even more clearly understood from observing the nature of the Hayashi Cabinet. This has already been explained in this newspaper's current affairs commentary on the 3rd. Recently, the Minister of Finance withdrew the budget compiled by Baba, recompiled it, and saved more than 260 million yuan in expenditures, but did not reduce military spending at all. The fourth point of the political program announced by the Hayashi Cabinet on the 8th also strongly emphasizes the importance of strengthening national defense. From these various measures, it can be seen that the new cabinet obeys the orders of the military without exception. Therefore, the diplomacy of Hayashi, who also serves as Foreign Minister, towards China is naturally dominated by the power of the military.</p>
<p>How should we deal with this so-called "clear diplomacy" towards China? It is very clear that the experience of the past year has already told us that only by adopting a firm policy of not ceding territory or humiliating the nation can we defeat the conspiracies and ambitions of the aggressors. Now, as the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, which is discussing major national policies, is being held, we especially hope that the attendees will be able to immediately discuss and decide on practical methods for "how to recover the territory and sovereignty that has been invaded" and "how to defend the territory and sovereignty that will be invaded."</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Negotiations with Germany</h3>
<p>Only Exchanging Views on Various Issues; Britain Has No Intention of Considering Returning Colonies</p>
<p>[London] The issue of Germany's demand to restore its pre-war colonies was the most important point discussed in the House of Commons last night. The government was subjected to continuous questioning from members of parliament. First, Conservative MP Lochland Purson inquired about the results of the conversation between German Ambassador Ribbentrop and Acting Foreign Secretary Halifax last week, and whether Foreign Secretary Eden could announce them. He also requested that the government promise not to return colonies to Germany or give it overseas trade opportunities before Parliament had discussed the matter. Since Foreign Secretary Eden is still on vacation, Lochland Purson's question was answered by Under-Secretary of State Cranborne, who said that the recent conversation between Acting Foreign Secretary Halifax and German Ambassador Ribbentrop could not be considered the beginning of negotiations. It was only an exchange of views on various issues in which both countries had an interest. He also mentioned Prime Minister Baldwin's declaration on April 27 of last year, stating that the British government had not discussed the issue. Conservative MP Adams then asked the Foreign Secretary whether, in order to dispel Germany's unrealistic thoughts, the Foreign Secretary could state in clear and unambiguous terms that the British government would not consider returning any territory under British political jurisdiction to National Socialist Germany. Cranborne replied that, as he had already stated, the British government had not previously considered this issue and was not considering it now. Adams said, "Is discussion not currently underway?" Cranborne replied, "I have said repeatedly that it has not been discussed before and is not being discussed now." Later, Liberal MP Harris asked whether the news published in foreign newspapers was completely unfounded. Cranborne said, "Indeed." Conservative MP Sandys then put forward a resolution stating, "Although Germany has made demands regarding colonies, the House of Commons expresses its satisfaction with the government's refusal to consider any return of territory." (Sixteenth Central News Agency Reuter's Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Sir Cranborne, representing the Foreign Secretary, replied to inquiries in the House of Commons, stating that diplomatic negotiations to gather five powers to conclude a West European pact were underway. A Labour MP wanted to know whether, after the signing of the Franco-Russian pact, there was any basis to rumors that the German government would retract its March 1936 proposal for a West European pact. Sir Cranborne replied that the German government had not submitted this note to the British government and that the rumors had no factual basis. The MP then asked why the German government had not answered the list of questions submitted by the British government in May of last year. Sir Cranborne replied that the German government had cited the reason that Britain had not yet expressed its views on the future of the League of Nations. Cranborne replied to questions regarding the participation of Italian warships in the Battle of Málaga, stating that the British government had not received any news of this, and that there were Soviet troops stationed in Barcelona and Madrid.

<h3>Göring, German Minister of Aviation, Engages in Activities in Poland Again</h3>
<p>To Hunt with the Polish President, Departing with a Declaration of Germany's Plea for Peace</p>
<p>Warsaw – German Minister of Aviation Göring arrived here at 9:30 this morning, and was met by the Deputy Foreign Minister, who hosted a luncheon to welcome him. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by the German Ambassador to Poland. Tomorrow morning, he will go to Białowieża to hunt with President Mościcki. Accompanying Göring were two secretaries and two adjutants, as well as ten plainclothes police officers. As the newspapers had not announced Göring's arrival time in Warsaw in advance, there were very few people at the station to welcome him. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Warsaw – Foreign reports suggest that when German Aviation Minister General Göring comes here to hunt, he often takes the opportunity to negotiate with Polish authorities and Gdańsk Free City Senate President Greiser, with the aim of Germany and Poland signing an agreement to return the Free City of Gdańsk to Germany. In return, Germany would provide two assurances: first, it would respect the current state of Poland's corridor; and second, Poland would still be able to freely use the Port of Gdańsk. Responsible parties here have formally denied the above news, saying that Greiser will not come here to hunt until the 26th of this month, and will not meet with General Göring. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Danzig – Danzig Senate President Greiser, in response to various rumors in the French newspapers, issued a statement saying that he was invited by the Polish President to participate in a hunt, which is his fourth time. His visit to Poland has no political purpose. He also said that various issues between Danzig and Poland have been satisfactorily resolved in recent negotiations, and any unexpected events can be handled by the responsible authorities. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>[Paris] British Foreign Secretary Eden and Polish Foreign Minister Beck had lunch together today in Cannes, southern France, and had a long conversation. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] German Aviation Minister Göring and Foreign Minister Neurath both spoke yesterday, unanimously expressing opposition to war. Göring declared at the International Veterans Conference yesterday, "Those who rattle their sabers the loudest accomplish nothing." He added, "Only those who have not experienced the cruelty of war are willing to talk about future wars. Germany's desire for peace is second to none." Neurath also published a statement in a Hamburg newspaper yesterday, saying, "Judging from the statements repeatedly issued by Germany, a powerful nation, and other civilized countries in Europe, there is no basis to say that peace is threatened within this cultural sphere." (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>Unified Command of Government Forces in Madrid</h3>
<p>More Than a Thousand Rebels Killed</p>
<p>[Madrid] General Miaja, Chairman of the National Defense Council, has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Madrid front, and all government forces in the surrounding areas are under his command. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Madrid – The government today appointed General Miaja as commander-in-chief of the front, as a result of three representatives of the National Defense Council going to Valencia to request it. With the command of the front unified, Prime Minister Caballero also gave a speech to 100,000 people, urging the conflicting factions within the People's Front to unite. The rebels today still tried to cut off the highway to Valencia, but after the government forces counterattacked with artillery and tanks, the highway remained open. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Madrid – As a result of the fierce fighting in the area of the Jarama River southeast of the capital in recent days, the Nationalist forces suffered a total of over a thousand casualties, and the government forces' positions have been improved. To the northeast of the capital, within the province of Guadalajara, the Nationalist forces are still continuing their advance. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Economic Cooperation Among the Four Nordic Countries</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden – A conference of the four Nordic countries, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, opened in Stockholm today. Its purpose is to study ways for these countries to help each other so that in the event of special international situations, such as war, that hinder international trade, the goods of these countries can still be exchanged and not become scarce. The Conservative Party's organ, "Svenska Dagbladet," recently reported that the four countries of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland have each established special committees within their countries to prepare economically for the above-mentioned mutual assistance measures. This was initiated by Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Measures to Prohibit Volunteer Support for Spain</h3>
<p>Provisionally Effective This Saturday; Monitoring Plan to Be Implemented Next Month</p>
<p>[London] The Sub-Committee of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War met this afternoon and immediately decided that: ❶ The measures to prohibit the dispatch of volunteers to Spain should take effect this Saturday; ❷ The monitoring plan should take effect from midnight on March 6, but the technical details can be revised by experts, taking into account Portugal's attitude. The Adjustment Committee is scheduled to hold a plenary meeting at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow to submit the previous decision for approval. It is understood that Italian Ambassador Grandi informed the Committee before the Sub-Committee meeting that Italy was willing to immediately conclude an agreement on the prohibition of sending volunteers to Spain. This attitude was the main reason for the Sub-Committee's decision. Portugal has accepted the implementation of the prohibition of volunteers, but has reservations about the implementation of the monitoring plan. The various delegations now believe that the decisions adopted by the Sub-Committee today will enable the naval powers of Britain, France, Germany and Italy to divide the Spanish waters into zones for monitoring. As March 6 is imminent, the Soviet Union does not have time to prepare, so its fleet is effectively unable to participate. In addition, if Portugal does not accept the monitoring plan, its waters will also be included in the monitoring scope of the British, French, German and Italian navies. As the attitudes of the countries concerned are now more consistent on the implementation of monitoring, Portugal will eventually accept the compromise proposed by Britain. According to the compromise proposed by Britain, Portugal would send its own personnel to monitor the border between Portugal and Spain and the ports of Portugal, assisted by British inspectors.

<h3>World Cotton Production Statistics</h3>
<p>Increases in China, the United States, and Russia</p>
<p>[Rome] The International Institute of Agriculture announced statistics stating that cotton production in China, the United States, and the Soviet Union has increased this year, so that world cotton production will increase by 10 million metric tons compared to last year, to 66 million metric tons. The current cotton inventory is about 28 million metric tons. Economic experts believe that although cotton production will increase, prices will not fall, because the countries with the largest increase in production are China and the Soviet Union, which used to be in short supply. Therefore, there will be no overproduction in the future. In addition, the demand situation in various places is also satisfactory. The prices of various other major raw materials have also increased, so cotton prices will not fall. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Diet Questions Finance and Military Affairs</h3>
<p>Army Minister Declares Efforts to Rectify the Military, Navy Minister Guarantees Absolute Non-Interference in Politics</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Diet continued smoothly today. The various political parties were extremely cautious, trying to avoid conflict. It can now be confidently predicted that most of the questions in the House of Peers will be about the budget and human rights issues, while the House of Representatives will mainly focus on ❶ researching national economic issues, ❷ establishing currency policy issues, ❸ curbing soaring prices, and methods to alleviate the rural economy. Seiyukai member Miyawaki Nagayoshi raised questions about military reduction and military interference in politics, and the atmosphere in the entire house suddenly became tense. Miyawaki listed examples to prove that the rectification of the military was unsatisfactory and that military interference in politics violated military discipline, demanding a clear answer from the Army Minister. At that time, shouts arose, with some shouting, "Too much talk will lead to dissolution!" At the same time, those who supported Miyawaki asked him to raise as many questions as possible, making the audience feel that there was a danger of an incident occurring. Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa first took the podium to answer, saying that no one in the Navy absolutely interferes in politics, and that there will never be such an act in the future. As he said this, applause and cheers erupted, deafening. Yonai then made an important statement, saying that Japan absolutely does not want to be the world's largest naval power. Army Minister Sugiyama Gen then took the podium to answer, saying that he is now engaged in thorough efforts to rectify the military. He has made this determination, and as he has been appointed Army Minister, his subordinates will inevitably have matters to report to him in their duties, but they cannot be allowed to express anything externally. After the Army Minister finished speaking, the house also responded with applause. That such serious questions could be concluded peacefully further shows the current intentions of the political parties. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>The Lin Cabinet's Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>Superficial Goodwill, Active Undertones</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Lin, in his capacity as Foreign Minister, gave a speech on foreign policy in the Diet on the 15th, focusing on diplomacy toward China, actively advocating the necessity of Sino-Japanese friendship, saying, "In order to clarify Sino-Japanese relations, it is not only necessary for the government to make efforts to understand each other's positions, but also to make frequent contacts between the people to promote the actual results of Sino-Japanese cooperation and assistance. At the same time, we will proceed to eliminate anything that hinders Sino-Japanese cooperation." These words indicate that the Lin Cabinet's policy toward China is based on goodwill work, but in order to achieve this goal, it does not hesitate to implement resolute measures. (Dispatch from Domei, 16th)</p>
<h3>Situations of Questioning in Both Houses</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives convened on the second day after a half-hour delay due to the aftermath of internal disturbances in the Seiyukai. They continued to question the speeches of the Ministers of State.</p>
<p>Seiyukai's Ota Masataka took the podium to ask four questions:</p>
<p>❶ The phrase "quasi-wartime finance" often seems to imply that finance is preparing for war, while diplomacy is useless. What is the truth?</p>
<p>❶ The government has revised the budget to curb rising prices, but can reducing local grant money reduce production prices? It is expected to delay and follow the old top plan, which is unacceptable and violates the constitution.</p>
<p>❶ Due to the increase in defense spending and the increase in public debt, the cost of living stabilization has been reduced. What financial plan does the government have for this?</p>
<p>❶ Regarding financial issues, is there a plan for private industry funds to support Manchuria, in addition to budgetary funds? What is the reason for the government's reduction in funding to the South Manchuria Railway?</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yuki answered:</p>
<p>I am deeply concerned about the balance between military expenditure and the stabilization of national life. To alleviate the poverty of rural areas, debt reorganization is most important. Therefore, regarding the grant system, I hope to temporarily leave room for consideration. As for the prediction of future finances, I said yesterday that there is no certainty. This is due to the current social situation, which is unavoidable. I have tried to compare the era of Finance Minister Takahashi with the era of Finance Minister Baba, trying to reconcile the financial policies of the two, but whether it will succeed is uncertain. He made extremely skeptical remarks, met with a mixture of laughter and applause.</p>
<p>Mr. Ota took the podium again, stating the uneven burden between urban and rural areas, and expressed dissatisfaction with the tax increase.</p>
<p>Miyazawa Taneji (Minseito) questioned the government's views on finance, industry, and small and medium-sized enterprise policies. At that time, there were few Seiyukai members in the seats, but Mr. Miyazawa continued to vigorously advocate the necessity of investing in Manchuria, and what production policies should be implemented for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yuki answered:</p>
<p>The government intends to continue implementing the same low-interest policy as the previous cabinet. As for the adverse effects of this reversal, we should cooperate with all parties to prevent it.</p>
<p>Next, Minister of Commerce Godo, Minister of Agriculture Yamazaki, and others made replies. Then, Prime Minister Lin answered as follows:</p>
<p>If investment in Manchuria is necessary, we will do our best to promote its activities. As for stabilizing the people's livelihood, I also have the same concern.</p>
<p>Mr. Miyazawa took the stage again, saying:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister only said that he has the same feeling, but I don't know what plan he has. If it is only a feeling, then the Diet will not be able to proceed with deliberations.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yuki answered on his behalf as follows: The method is being considered, but it cannot be explained here, because it is not yet the time to explain.</p>
<p>Miyawaki Nagayoshi (Seiyukai) raised questions about national defense spending, military rectification, and military interference in politics. The Diet then became tense. He said that recently a small number of military personnel have been interfering in politics. If the government does not take a decisive attitude, it will inevitably lead to unexpected situations in the future. The military ministers should set an example and regulate them.</p>
<p>Navy Minister Yonai answered:</p>
<p>The Imperial Japanese Navy strives to stabilize East Asia without being threatened by other countries, nor invading other countries, and does not engage in arms races with other countries, nor does it want to build the only navy in the world. As for the issue of military rectification, we will make more efforts in the future to ensure the Sacred Decree is implemented without error.</p>
<p>Army Minister Sugiyama took the stage with an excited expression and answered as follows:</p>
<p>The national defense expenditure is as stated in the budget for the 12th year of Showa. As for the detailed figures, they concern military equipment and are not suitable for explanation. As for military rectification, since the era of Minister Terauchi, we have been diligently working towards this goal. I believe that this matter has not yet been completed and must be worked on in the future. As for where the outbreak of the February 26th Incident came from, there are many aspects that the entire nation should reflect on. Military interference in politics has been seriously cautioned against since the time of the previous minister.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Lin answered:</p>
<p>Military personnel should not interfere in politics in their duties, but ministers can of course interfere in politics in their duties.</p>
<p>Mr. Miyawaki also said, "Please do not allow a small number of military personnel to interfere in politics, so as to correct today's bad habits, and I hope that a diplomatic policy will be established based on national defense." Prime Minister Lin, who also served as Foreign Minister, answered that he would engage in coordination and avoid disrupting. Thus, the Q&amp;A on military rectification temporarily came to an end.</p>
<p>Hamano Tetsutaro of the Minseito Party believed that the failure of the Song Yuyuan Cabinet, and the requirement that the military ministers be limited to active-duty generals or lieutenant generals, and the issue of requiring them to leave the party, were serious cases of military interference in politics, and questioned the reasons.</p>
<p>Army Minister Sugiyama answered:</p>
<p>It is a misunderstanding to think that the military interfered with the formation of the Cabinet of General Song Yuan. The three chiefs had already selected candidates, but all of the candidates resigned. Limiting the military ministers to active-duty generals or lieutenant generals is to take responsibility for the current state of military progress. It is necessary to know that the situation within the military must be absolute. It would be inconvenient for retired officers. Prime Minister Lin answered that he did not exclude political parties, and that there were many concurrent cabinet members, which was by no means imitating Western fascism, and that there were other reasons. I am willing to respect the constitution and implement unique constitutional politics. The meeting adjourned at 6:26 p.m.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Peers convened at 10 a.m. today. Tokubo first took the stage and listed examples of torture and human rights violations that occurred in various prefectures during the general election of the House of Representatives the year before last, hoping to eradicate torture and the actions of the police before stepping down. There was applause. Interior Minister Kawarada took the podium to answer, saying that it was a pity that such torture incidents occurred frequently in the Sacred Age, and the government would eradicate this inauspicious incident in the future. Next, Kanahara Michiyuki raised financial issues and took the stage to ask questions, raising long questions about the new budget and tax increases, but it was only a question in the style of the House of Peers. Thus, the stage for the Q&amp;A battle shifted to the House of Representatives in the afternoon. (Dispatch from Domei, 16th)</p>
<h3>Suzuki, President of the Party, Decides to Resign</h3>
<p>Seiyukai Executives Discuss Follow-Up</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Seiyukai held a joint meeting of advisors, executive directors, and secretaries-general at 10 a.m. on the 16th to discuss follow-up matters, as Suzuki, the president, had decided to resign. They decided on the timing of the president's resignation and the specific methods. According to general observation, a general affairs committee system will be implemented after the president's resignation as a temporary measure. (Dispatch from Domei, 16th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After Suzuki, the president of the Seiyukai, expressed his intention to resign, the Joint Council of Advisors and General Affairs believes that there is no other way than to accept his resignation, but they must listen to his opinions on handling the aftermath in order to follow them. It was decided that the executive committee would be responsible for handling the follow-up. Secretary-General Ando visited President Suzuki at 2 p.m. on the 16th to report on the progress of the Joint Council and discuss follow-up measures. It is believed that there is no one within the party who enjoys widespread popularity at present. Most people advocate the establishment of an acting committee, and the candidates for this small number of committee members are most likely to be Ichiro Hatoyama, Yonezo Maeda, Toshio Shimada, and Chikyūhei Nakajima, who are all influential. There is also an argument for adding a member from the House of Peers, but the number of committee members has not yet been decided. The situation within the party is extremely complicated, with some advocating for complete liberation and others actively engaging in new party movements. It is difficult to predict what will happen next. The future of the Seiyukai is attracting much attention from all sides. (Dispatch from Domei, 16th)</p>
<h3>Siberian Railway Accelerates Double-Tracking</h3>
<p>To Be Completed This Spring; Militarily Important</p>
<p>[Moscow] The second line of the Far Eastern Railway has been laid with standard gauge and station sidings totaling 3,500 kilometers, with about 600 kilometers remaining to be built from Boli to Voroshilov City. As of New Year's Day this year, 63.5 million cubic meters of earthwork and 870,000 cubic meters of construction work have been completed. Thousands of bridges and other structures have been built. Many locomotive and car repair shops and machine factories have been built. Thousands of houses, dining rooms, schools, clubs, hospitals, kindergartens, and nurseries have also been built. As of the beginning of this year, 1,126,000 cubic meters of various masonry houses and 1,716,000 cubic meters of wooden houses have been built. The terrain, geology, and climate of the construction area are extremely difficult. Most of the line must pass through mountains, cross dozens of large rivers, and thousands of small rivers and streams. The winter lasts for seven months each year, sometimes with temperatures reaching minus 50 degrees Celsius. In the summer, the entire line is continuously rainy, and most areas are even frozen all year round. The Soviet Union is building this second line for the purpose of developing the national economy of the Far East. After its completion, the economic development of the Far Eastern region will be even more rapid. (Dispatch from TASS, 15th)</p>
<h3>United States Sets Up Restrictions to Prevent Foreign Capital Inflow</h3>
<p>Although the Ministry of Finance Has Recently Purchased Large Amounts of Silver, It Has Not Reached the Ratio of One Gold to Five Silver</p>
<p>[Washington] Treasury officials allowed tonight that they would soon decide on methods to deal with the excessive amount of foreign capital that has recently flowed into the United States. There is currently approximately 75 billion yuan of foreign capital in the United States. If it is suddenly withdrawn due to domestic or foreign environmental reasons, it will pose a danger to the internal credit institutions of the United States. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau held a meeting with Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Landis and Federal Reserve Chairman Eccles today to discuss the matter. After the meeting, it was announced that the government should take action within a few days. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told Congress today that the large amount of cash flowing into the United States has made it difficult for the Treasury Department to succeed in its efforts to prepare the currency area to a ratio of three gold to one silver. Although the Treasury Department has purchased as much silver as possible, it has only reached the ratio of one gold to five silver so far. The Treasury Secretary said that since the implementation of the Silver Purchase Act, the Treasury Department has purchased 1,139,194,172 ounces of silver. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Military Expenditures of Various Countries in the Past Two Years</h3>
<p>Doubled; Germany Increased Fivefold</p>
<p>[Washington] The Foreign Policy Association announced today that Germany's military expenditures increased more than fivefold between 1934 and 1936, while the world's military expenditures doubled, estimated at US$11,000,000,000. Military budgets of various countries began to increase after Japan invaded Manchuria, and increased even faster after Hitler seized power in Germany. Today, military expenditures of various countries uniformly assume that war is about to break out. From 1934 to 1936, the military expenditures of various countries were as follows: The Soviet Union increased from $1,000,000,000 to $2,963,100,000; the United States increased from $710,000,000 to $964,900,000; France increased from $582,700,000 to $716,400,000; Britain increased from $480,600,000 to $846,900,000; Germany increased from $381,800,000 to $2,600,000,000; Japan increased from $271,900,000 to $307,900,000; Italy increased from $263,700,000 to $807,800,000.

<h3>Balkan Entente Political Conference</h3>
<p>Foreign Ministers of Four Countries Attend; Discuss Current Situation in Europe</p>
<p>Athens – The Standing Political Conference of the Balkan Entente countries began at 5:00 p.m. today. Those attending were Greek Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Metaxas, Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović, Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu, and Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Athens – Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Metaxas hosted a banquet last night for the chief delegates of the countries attending the conference and delivered a speech on the spot, saying: "The consultation policy of the Balkan Peninsula countries has produced satisfactory results, which is gratifying. The recent conclusion of a friendship treaty between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria is particularly gratifying, because this friendship treaty not only creates a good future for Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, but is also beneficial to all Balkan Peninsula countries." It was then that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Stojadinović, who took over as Chairman of this conference after the Turkish Foreign Minister, delivered a reply, stating that the situation in the Balkan Peninsula had greatly improved, which should be attributed to the Balkan consultations. According to informed sources, the representatives of the Balkan Entente countries discussed the general political situation yesterday, especially the situation created by the Spanish events, and recorded the two facts that the cooperation between Britain and France is becoming closer and closer and the danger of a European war is gradually decreasing. In addition, there will be some requests regarding the repercussions caused by the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean agreement. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Interferes in Religious Dispute</h3>
<p>Orders Religious Minister to Prepare for Believer Elections</p>
<p>[Berlin] German leader Hitler is now intervening in the religious dispute. Today, he issued an order stating that because the German Religious Committee has failed to reach a compromise among the pastor groups, the church must establish a new system to enjoy complete freedom and follow the wishes of religious believers. The order also instructs Religious Minister Kerrl to prepare for a general election of pastors to achieve this goal. (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Berlin] German leader Hitler today intervened in the disputes among various factions of the German Church, ordering 40 million Christians to vote and decide on the guidelines of the German Church, to see whether the church should obey the doctrines set by the National Socialist Party. According to reports, the old guard and extreme National Socialist believers in the church have been in dispute for a long time. The resignation of the entire administrative committee of the church appointed by the government has pushed the situation to extremes. The three issues that believers are now voting on are: ㊀ Should the church become a tool of the state? ㊁ Should the church promote the gospel of racial purity? ㊂ Should the Old Testament be revised? Hitler's order was issued in the name of Religious Minister Kerrl. Hitler has always avoided direct intervention in church affairs, so this action is noteworthy. (15th, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Kallio Elected President of Finland</h3>
<p>Helsinki, Finland: President Svinhufvud was elected on February 16, 1931, for a six-year term, which has now expired. The Parliament (Finland has a unicameral system) voted to elect Speaker Kallio, leader of the Agrarian League, as the new president. (15th, Havas)</p>
<p>Helsinki, Finland: Prime Minister Kallio was elected as the new president with 177 out of 300 votes. Kallio is 64 years old, a member of the Agrarian League, and a farmer. He was elected as a Senator in 1918 and has since served as a minister, speaker of parliament, and prime minister. He is a prominent figure in Finland, and the 1918 agricultural reform law is particularly well-known. (15th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] People in the local state party are quite surprised that former President Svinhufvud failed to be re-elected in the Finnish presidential election. It is generally expected that the Kivimäki cabinet will resign on March 1, and a left-wing cabinet will be formed to succeed it. Svinhufvud is one of the leading figures in Finland, and is regarded here as the "Hindenburg of Finland". (15th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Chinese Ship Runs Aground Near Makung Island</h3>
<p>Makung: A report came in suddenly at 9 a.m. yesterday that a foreign transport ship had run aground in the southeast of Yupu. It was also suspected that the foreign transport was illegally importing goods, so the destroyer "Asakaze" was dispatched to the area for inspection and returned at 5 p.m. According to the report, the transport ship was the Chinese transport ship "Yongji", 2,000 tons, en route from Shanghai via Keelung to Shantou. Due to rudder failure, it was drifted by wind and waves, causing it to run aground. There was no other intention. One crew member is also missing. (16th, Allied Press)</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Major Leaks Military Secrets</h3>
<p>Tried by Federal Court, Involving Two Japanese Officers</p>
<p>[Washington] U.S. Navy Major Francis Weisswager, who was arrested on July 14 last year on charges of conspiring to leak naval secrets to Japan, was interrogated today by the Federal Court. Weisswager declared that he would not defend himself against the charge of espionage. Weisswager's arrest involved two Japanese naval officers, but both were not arrested due to their special status as diplomats. These two Japanese, formerly stationed at the Japanese Embassy, have probably returned to Japan. More than 50 U.S. Navy personnel have come here from various naval bases to prepare for testimony. The military police had been secretly investigating Weisswager for months before his arrest. (Central News Agency, 15th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Japanese Unknown Astronomer Discovers Daniel's Comet</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese astronomical community has discovered many new stars since last year. Recently, an unknown astronomical student discovered a long-lost comet among tens of millions of stars, attracting attention from the academic community. Shimizu Shinichi from Shimada Town, Shizuoka Prefecture, is an amateur astronomer. He photographed celestial bodies on January 31 and discovered Daniel's Comet in his photographs. This comet was discovered by Daniel of the Princeton Observatory in the United States (December 1909). According to theory, it should return to its original location in eight years, but it has not been seen since. The astronomical community is paying close attention to this star. Its whereabouts have now been discovered by Shimizu. After receiving this report, the Tokyo Observatory conducted an investigation and confirmed that it was indeed Daniel's Comet. It then notified all relevant parties and reported to the Central Bureau of the International Astronomical Union in Copenhagen. (16th, Allied Press)</p>

<h3>Petition from Gansu Relief Representatives to the Central Government</h3>
<p>Reports on the Bandit Situation in the Province and Requests Allocation of Large Sums for Relief</p>
<p>Beijing News: Gansu has suffered from natural disasters and man-made calamities in recent years, resulting in an extremely dire situation. Recently, the relief representatives from the province, Shui Zigao and Wen Wei, presented a detailed report to the central government on the disaster situation and requested relief. The original text of the petition is transcribed below:</p>
<p>"We have investigated and found that Gansu is a poor and sparsely populated area. Since the 16th and 17th years of the Republic of China, it has suffered from repeated disasters, and its vitality has not yet recovered. Unfortunately, the desperate communist bandits have entered Gansu one after another, ravaging the entire province. The disaster situation is extremely severe and unprecedented. The general situation of the disaster areas and losses is presented in detail below:</p>
<p>Disaster Areas</p>
<p>In the 23rd year, the communist bandits Liu Zidan, Yang Sen, and others occupied the five prefectures of Longdong and Qingyang. In the 24th year, the bandit leaders Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, Xu Haidong, and others entered the area from southern Shaanxi and northern Sichuan, dividing their forces to harass the 30-odd counties in southeastern Longdong. Last year, the bandit leaders Zhu De, Xu Xiangqian, Xiao Ke, He Long, and others entered the country with their entire force from northern Sichuan, passing through the Tao River basin, harassing the north and south of Longdong, and dividing their forces to flee to Hexi. The cities and towns they captured include Lintan, Zhangxian, Weiyuan, Chengxian, Huixian, Liangdang, Tongwei, Huining, Longde, Chongxin, Huanxian, Heshui, Kangxian, Jingtai, Gulang, Yongchang, Minle, Linze, Shanzhou, Gaotai, and other 20 counties. The counties that suffered the most severe damage include Minxian, Lintao, Longxi, Wushan, Gangu, Tianshui, Tai'an, Dingxi, Jingning, Zhuanglang, Xihe, Lixian, Huating, Huaping, Pingliang, Jingchuan, Zhengning, Ningxian, Qingyang, Zhenyuan, Haiyuan, Guyuan, Jingyuan, Yongdeng, Wuwei, Minqin, Zhangye, and other 27 counties. The next most severely affected areas include Gaolan, Yuzhong, Kangle, Xiahe, Qingshui, Lingtai, Wudu, Xizhou, and other ten-odd counties, which have also been harmed. Of the 68 counties in Gansu Province, the number of disaster-stricken counties is almost 60, making nearly the entire province a disaster area.</p>
<p>Disaster Losses</p>
<p>Gansu is purely an agricultural province, and industry and commerce have never been developed. Farmers' savings are limited to grain and livestock. The communist bandits Liu Zidan, Mao Zedong, and others occupied the Longdong area for two or three years, and had already looted everything. Last year, Zhu De, Xu Xiangqian, and other bandits passed through the barren areas of Songpan and Mao'ergai, and were exhausted. Once they entered Gansu, they not only looted all the grain and livestock, but also dug up all the farmers' hidden property. Excluding the losses in Hexi, which have not yet been investigated and confirmed, the losses in the southeastern Longdong counties are estimated at more than 2,155,400 shi of grain and more than 10,376,000 heads of livestock. The value of other losses is not less than that of food and livestock. As for the direct disaster-stricken population, it has reached three to four million, accounting for more than half of the total population of Gansu. If we include the people indirectly affected by the bandit disasters, it can be said that the entire province has become a disaster area.</p>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned disaster areas and losses, the disaster situation in Gansu is extremely serious. Just as the Shaanxi-Gansu Incident occurred, transportation was cut off, and food prices soared. Many disaster victims have died of cold and starvation. In the blink of an eye, it will be spring plowing, and there is a lack of seeds, cattle, and horses. I am afraid that crops will be lost again, and the disaster will become more and more severe. In November of this year, the government approved the allocation of 300,000 yuan in public value, which is equivalent to less than 200,000 yuan in cash. This is a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. The representatives are petitioning on behalf of the people, and they should send a detailed document with the statistical table of bandit disaster losses in Gansu to your council for consideration. They implore you to have compassion on the disaster-stricken people in the border areas and approve the allocation of a large sum of relief funds to provide assistance. We are extremely urgent and await your orders."</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>High Court Investigates Sex Scandal</p>
<p>Zhang Yongquan, the young owner of Zhang Xiangfeng Candy Store outside the Changmen Gate, is dissolute and extravagant. Recently, a young woman named Chen Yichun sued him in the District Court for violating public morals and accused Shi Renlin, an employee of the Zhenguang Great Crying Court, of assisting him in the crime. The District Court Prosecutor He Jingcen summoned Zhang Yongquan and Shi Renlin to court and detained them for investigation and suspended visitation. Zhang's father, Zuiqiao, repeatedly requested bail but was refused. On the 4th of this month, bail was approved. At that time, a citizen named Wang Zhaojie submitted a complaint to the High Court, stating that Prosecutor He's sudden approval of bail for Zhang and Shi was suspicious and requested a thorough investigation. On the 9th of this month, the District Prosecutor's Office summoned Zhang Yongquan and Shi Renlin to court, detained them, and immediately filed a public prosecution. Zhang Yongquan was charged with raping a girl under the age of sixteen, and Shi Renlin was charged with aiding the crime. The District Court will hold a public hearing in the coming days. As for Wang Zhaojie's request for a thorough investigation of the prosecutor, the High Court Prosecutor summoned Zhang Zuiqiao and others on the afternoon of the 16th and Prosecutor Peng opened the court for investigation. He then ordered them to wait for a scheduled retrial.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption from Business Tax</p>
<p>The Chambers of Commerce of Zhenjiang, Wujin, Wuxi, Kunshan, Wuxian, Taicang, Changshu, Jiangyin, Yixing, and other counties believe that since the income tax is being implemented, merchants in various regions should unanimously support it. However, the current business tax must be levied regardless of profit or loss, and the laws of various provinces are not consistent. There are many conflicts with the income tax. According to the previous secret resolution in Shanghai, they jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to request a suspension of the tax in order to reduce the burden on merchants. In addition, the Wuxi Cotton Textile Industry Association stated that the industry has been suppressed for years due to the influence of high prices and cheap sales, and has suffered heavy losses. Although there was a slight improvement last year and there was hope for recovery, it is still difficult to make up for previous losses. The amount of consolidated tax paid, based on the seven factories in Wuxi County alone, is more than one million yuan per year. According to the principle of levying consolidated tax, those who have paid consolidated tax should no longer pay other taxes. Now that the spinning industry has just begun to breathe, it does not seem appropriate to levy income tax on its profits. Yesterday, they specially telegraphed the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee to request exemption. In addition, the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce stated that there are many issues to be studied and discussed regarding the newly implemented income tax. It is specifically scheduled for 3:00 p.m. on the 20th of this month to invite Weng Zhiyong, director of the Jiangsu Office of Income Tax, and accountants Pan Xulun and Li Wenjie from the Lixin Accounting Firm to give lectures at the meeting. Notice has been given to all industries to attend the lectures at that time.</p>

<h3>The Truth about the So-Called Chinese People's Front and a Review of Its Theories (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Luo Meihuan</p>
<p>"Some people misunderstand the United Front, thinking that since we are standing together, there is no need for any disputes among our allies..."</p>
<p>"The United Front absolutely does not eliminate the contradictions within the Front, and the United Front itself exists and continues in constant struggle. Disputes among allies are still an undeniable fact. The use of strategies and tactics is itself a process of struggle. It can be said that the internal survival and development of the United Front depends entirely on this kind of struggle... Therefore, because of the union, fearing internal struggle and avoiding the necessary disputes is not only not beneficial to the United Front, but also a kind of disloyalty to the common sacred war..."</p>
<p>(The above is from Liu Di's Basic Understanding of Saving the Nation)</p>
<p>This is the true meaning of their advocacy of unity. We know that on the one hand, they oppose "the theory of weapons alone" and advocate immediate resistance against Japan. On the other hand, they advocate that during the resistance against Japan, while resisting foreign aggression, they should also engage in internal struggles. This kind of omnipotent tactic has probably never been seen in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad. The result of this kind of unity is not saving the nation but destroying it, it is inviting internal chaos rather than unifying to resist foreign aggression, and it is clearly a dead end.</p>
<p>They believe that China's war of resistance against Japan must be led by the Chinese Communist Party. Those who do not share their ideas are first deceived into joining them, but during the process of uniting, they must be absolutely controlled by them. If you are not controlled, they will start internal struggles, until it is completed and everything is uniform. They say: "Because the movement becomes more and more pure, elite, and large as it progresses. The true warriors can only be cultivated and tempered in this process." (See Liu Zhi's "Putting Thousands of Bullets on One Target.") What is meant by pure and large, what is meant by cultivating and tempering, can be understood without saying so.</p>
<p>Therefore, the United Front is the Communist Front. Those within the union are their cat's paws. Before the resistance against Japan is completed, they have already decided to eat you up, only seeking to expand their red terror forces, only to repay their motherland, the Communist International. They are not stingy at all to sacrifice the country and the nation.</p>
<p>Second: It is mobilizing the masses for riots, not arming the masses.</p>
<p>To cope with the national crisis, it is of course necessary to mobilize the people of the whole country to arm themselves and resist the enemy. The prerequisite for arming the people is to first provide them with basic military knowledge and training. The meaning of the government's handling of military training in recent years lies in this, and it has already achieved good results. This is something that every citizen should be proud of. However, those in the People's Front, who have ulterior motives, are on the one hand calling for arming the people, but on the other hand they oppose the government's implementation of military training. Please see their incitement against military training:</p>
<p>"Now the tricks are new again, military training, military training, busy all day long, busy all day long to make your body and mind exhausted, but teach people to say to work hard to build national defense" (Li Gongpu, editor-in-chief of Chinese Voice Collection, Chapter 16)</p>
<p>"The people are destitute, that is, the whole country is a soldier, and all the money in the country is used to buy airplanes and cannons, but how can you walk if you are hungry? How can you pick up a gun." (Gao Shiqi's letter to the consumptive masses)</p>
<p>To cope with the national crisis, should everyone endure a little hardship? How does the hardship of military training compare to the soldiers fighting against the cold and blood in front? The people's livelihood is one thing, and the country should think of ways to provide relief. Is it because the people's livelihood is difficult, that the country does not need to be saved, that national defense does not need to be established, and that the enemy's airplanes and cannons can arbitrarily oppress us? This is something that people in the People's Front know very well. Their intention is to riot the masses, not to arm the masses, because rioting the masses is the Communist Party's specialty, because rioting the masses can achieve their purpose of taking advantage of the chaos. The government's handling of military training, so that the people of the whole country are in step, is the benefit of the country, but it is the harm of the Communist Party. Their reason for opposing military training and opposing enriching national defense lies here. The true meaning of their high-sounding armed masses resisting the enemy and saving the country also lies here.</p>
<p>Third: They want to create a separatist situation.</p>
<p>They are full of talk about unity, full of talk about union, but the method they actually practice is to think of creating a separatist situation. They say:</p>
<p>"...and then the parties open a joint conference, in the local government, the factual government, I think the first step is to recognize each other's existence, give all parties' governments the power of great autonomy, and also from party negotiations to local government negotiations and cooperation, in the local armed forces, also adopt the above methods, to achieve cooperation and unity." - Li Gongpu's Political National Defense Mobilization</p>
<p>This completely plagiarizes the old tune of the United Provinces Autonomy of more than ten years ago. In theory it is untenable, and in fact, except for a few red bandits like fish in a cauldron, all the local governments and all the local masses in the country are strongly led by the Kuomintang. What else is there to talk about, what else is there to cooperate? What else is there to recognize each other's existence? In order to demand the existence of a few communist bandits, they sang the proposition of division and provoked the local government's feelings towards the central government. This is the conscientious proposition that the People's Front people advocate every day.</p>
<p>Fourth: Regarding the issue of Chinese people not fighting Chinese people</p>
<p>It is right that Chinese people do not fight Chinese people, but there should be a limit to it. That is, all traitors and bandits who endanger the country and the nation, although they have the blood relationship of the Chinese nation, but we should be banished from the country and the nation and absolutely cannot be regarded as Chinese people, and absolutely cannot apply the sentence "Chinese people do not fight Chinese people" to this group of people. Not only that, but we should also fight them, so that they can be eliminated, so as not to be an obstacle to foreign countries. For example, Yin Rugeng and his ilk, is he not a "descendant of the Yellow Emperor", does he not promote autonomous nation-building? If we also talk about Chinese people not fighting Chinese people with Yin Rugeng and his ilk, wouldn't it be a joke?</p>
<p>The People's Front shouting out this slogan is naturally aimed at the red bandits, but the fact that the red bandits cannot become Chinese people has already been proven by iron-like facts. In terms of their beliefs, their motherland is the Communist International, not the Republic of China. They no longer have the concept of the Chinese nation. How can people without the concept of the Chinese nation be considered Chinese? Furthermore, in terms of their actions: for more than ten years, they have brutally killed innocent people, burned down houses, and caused banditry in more than ten provinces, losing immeasurable national strength, thereby inviting the oppression of foreign aggression. They are actively working to reduce the number of Chinese people and Chinese national strength, creating opportunities for the enemy to invade. Can this kind of action be counted as Chinese people? If those who shout internationalism can be counted as Chinese people, then how can those who advocate Pan-Asianism not be counted as Chinese people? If recognizing the Communist Party, which uses terrorist policies to establish a Soviet, is Chinese, then how can various pseudo-organizations in the Northeast and Hebei, which promote autonomy, not be recognized as Chinese? Therefore, talking about "Chinese people not fighting Chinese people" with the Chinese Communist Party is as absurd as talking about Chinese people not fighting Chinese people" with pseudo-organizations.</p>
<p>Uniting the truly patriotic Chinese people to eliminate the sham patriotic Chinese people who betray the country and the nation is our legitimate way to strive for survival.</p>
<p>From the above, we know that the People's Front is the Communist Front, and we know that the proposition of the People's Front is a proposition that poisons the country and the nation. Standing on the position of "Chinese people," we can only relentlessly eliminate it. At the same time, we hope that the general followers who echo what others say will quickly wake up and throw themselves under the banner of the Three Principles of the People, taking on the responsibility of saving the country.</p>
<p>Some may say that the Chinese Communist Party has been eking out a precarious existence in recent years, and seems to have awakened a little. If they sincerely resist the enemy, then for the sake of uniting forces, it does not seem appropriate to refuse too much. Actually, it is not so. First: the Communist Party absolutely has no concept of credibility and morality. They participated in the Kuomintang revolution for eleven years and once swore to implement the Kuomintang's political platform, but as soon as they had a little power, they wanted to eliminate the Kuomintang. This is the lesson of past tolerance of communism. First: They have had anti-Japanese propaganda since September 18, and there are various names such as the Anti-Japanese Advance Team and the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. On the surface, it seems that they are also generous and enthusiastic for the country, but during the Anti-Japanese War on September 18, the National Army in Jiangxi was ordered to transfer to Shanghai to participate in the war, but as soon as it arrived in Nanchang, the Communist Party launched a full-scale attack on Ji'an. Later, the National Army returned to Ji'an and defeated the Communist Party, but because the aid to Shanghai was late, it ended the Battle of Shanghai. This not only proves that they do not have the slightest intention to resist the enemy, but also try their best to contain the National Army's anti-Japanese progress. They are now repeating the old tune, but it is just the intention of playing the lute and singing. We must never be fooled again. If they are truly awake, the government already has regulations for "self-renewal," and they still have the opportunity to surrender. As for advocating divided opposition—union, then we only have to implement the proposition of securing the interior first before resisting foreign aggression, so as not to directly restrain the opposition.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>The Situation Creates a Surge in Government Bonds</p>
<p>Up from Seventy Cents to Two Dollars and Forty Cents; Class A Bonds Expected to Sell for Eighty Dollars</p>
<p>Yesterday's price increase on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was unprecedented in months. The buying interest on the trading floor was extremely strong. Although sellers were selling, they were very strict on price and dared not let go. Some were still going in after selling, because in general, people have the same view on the future of prices. Government bonds are one of the chips, and the increase in capital of Tongming Industrial Bank is also for the 10 million yuan of Reconstruction Bonds, so there is no reason to underestimate them. Although various prices have reached new highs, Class A bonds are still relatively weak. Some people expect Class A bonds to reach eighty dollars in the future, which is an exaggeration. However, due to the shortage of goods, there are also considerable reasons. The opening was the strongest yesterday, especially the domestic ones, which rose by one dollar and six and a half cents, were the strongest. Nos. 4, 6, 11, 10, and 47 were all being bought in, covering shorts and making new positions, swarming at once. There were more sellers of only Nos. 3 and 5, and the rest were small transactions. The deficit on the list before the market was still strong, and it was slightly weaker from the domestic long position, but there was still a continuation of the rise, and each price was raised, and the situation did not weaken. The total result of the two trading sessions showed that the price rose from 70 cents to two dollars and forty cents. The total number of transactions was 12 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the left. (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>
<h3>Yarn Flower</h3>
<p>People share the same sentiment, how can yarn prices not be high?</p>
<p>Futures are used for speculation; spot goods are used for hoarding.</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm, and the price surge is intense because people are thinking about mitigating potential losses by seeking value in rising prices. Consequently, yarn, cotton, flour, and wheat have become top speculative commodities. Furthermore, powerful individuals are also hoarding spot goods, which drives up futures prices and fuels enthusiastic demand for actual yarn. Merchants from inland Yunnan and other regions are particularly active in procuring these goods, further bolstering market sentiment. The financial sector has re-engaged in vigorous absorption, tightening the market further, and propelling prices upward.</p>
<p>Tagged Yarn Jumps Three to Four Yuan</p>
<p>In the morning session, tagged yarn prices rose across all months due to positive news from the previous day. Massive buying from the financial sector caused a shortage of available stock. Prices then increased again. However, as some in the industry continued to increase holdings of yarn in their warehouses, the Osaka Sanpin yarn market saw a decline, leading to calmer market sentiment and a tendency towards selling, which slightly weakened prices. As a result, prices for all months rose by 1.10 to 1.34 yuan compared to the previous day's closing prices. The afternoon session saw continued price increases, driven by heavy buying from the financial sector and widespread rumors. After the second round of trading, raw cotton prices rose, igniting a strong buying frenzy, and prices surged further. Traders bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon. Sales included 1,450 bales from Jifeng, 950 bales from Guyi, 2,200 bales from Yuda, 1,950 bales from Jinchang, 1,450 bales from Mingde, 2,450 bales from Hexing, 1,350 bales from Gengfeng, 3,950 bales from Yichang, 2,750 bales from Runkang, 1,300 bales from Fukang, and 1,000 bales from Yongda. Purchases included 3,800 bales from Dafu, 5,450 bales from Tongji, 1,350 bales from Yukang, 1,650 bales from Senkang, 4,000 bales from Yuanyi, 2,650 bales from Dachangcheng, 1,000 bales from Shengyuan, and 1,850 bales from Fengtai.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Improve</p>
<p>Daily statistics show that various merchants bought a total of 3,168 bales, with selling prices up by 2.3 yuan. The purchase amounts for each merchant are listed below:</p>
<p>Speculative Targets Concentrate on Cotton, Market Prices Soar</p>
<p>Distant May Futures Reach New Highs —14565—</p>
<p>The cotton market is soaring. After a prolonged period of quiet stagnation, any opportunity triggers intense back-and-forth pulling, leading to unstoppable price increases. The market generally believes that the Third Plenary Session will proceed smoothly, leading to strong expectations for rising prices. Consequently, speculators are extremely active, and most targets have shifted to tagged cotton, further fueling the price surge.</p>
<p>Cotton Rises Over One Yuan</p>
<p>In the morning session, tagged cotton prices rose uniformly across all months. Due to numerous rumors and extensive activity, Tongji alone purchased 10,000 dan, tightening the market. All months jumped by 2.2 to 2.3 yuan. However, after the second round of trading, bullish investors took profits, and Indian cotton and other cotton types also declined, resulting in no shortage of sellers. The market then retreated. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.5 to 0.15 yuan compared to the previous day's closing prices. The afternoon session saw a shift towards brisk trading and strong buying interest. Rumors circulated widely, all pointing to positive developments. The financial sector vigorously bought, intensifying the price surge. Distant May futures reached a new high of 45.65 yuan at closing. As a result, prices for all months rose again by 0.4 to 1 yuan compared to the morning closing prices. Sales included 3,000 dan from Jinchang, 2,800 dan from Daqing, 1,400 dan from Jinyu, 1,300 dan from Taixing, 3,800 dan from Shenchang, 2,300 dan from Taichang, 2,000 dan from Tonghe, 1,900 dan from Xinhua, 1,500 dan from Yuanxingchang, 5,500 dan from Changhe, 4,400 dan from Gongyichang, 4,000 dan from Runkang, and 5,600 dan from Yikang and 5,000 dan from Xinchang. Purchases included 19,400 dan from Tongji, 12,500 dan from Yuda, 3,500 dan from Renfeng, 4,300 dan from Dachangxian, 1,900 dan from Dachang, 2,400 dan from Dafu, 4,400 dan from Gengfeng, 5,400 dan from Fengtai, 8,100 dan from Xincheng, 3,300 dan from Jinghua, and 10,000 dan from Changhe. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Japanese Factories Procure Fine Cotton</p>
<p>Consumption of spot cotton has not yet fully recovered, but factories are gradually becoming more active. This is because the price surge for forward contracts is particularly strong, and the source of supply remains unclear.</p>
<p>U.S. Cotton Market Still Watching Government Actions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with sluggish trading. Traders were mostly awaiting developments in Washington regarding cotton loans and legislative matters. Prices fluctuated from a decline of four points to an increase of one point. Demand for old cotton was strong, with cooperative brokers acting as buyers and few sellers. Forward sales were limited, and there were few new accounts. Later, some sold distant months to offset purchases of cottonseed oil, slightly softening the market. Prices rebounded at closing. Spot prices rose by four points, while futures fell by two to rose by four points. English cotton spot prices fell by six points, and futures fell by four points. Indian cotton initially fell due to selling by futures traders but later rebounded due to buying by European exporters when prices declined. Bengalese declined by 1.5 to 1.5 rupees, Oomra declined by one rupee, and White Broach declined by 2.15 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 15th).</p>
<p>Another telegram from Bombay dated 16th predicts that White Broach will open at 213.5 rupees, Oomra at 205.15 rupees, and Bengalese at 179 rupees, all up by 0.15 rupees.</p>

<h3>The United National Salvation Grand Alliance of All Circles Issued an Important Declaration Yesterday</h3>
<p>Telegraph the Nation, Requesting Uniform Advocacy; Petition the Third Plenary Session, Requesting Adoption</p>
<p>The United National Salvation Grand Alliance of All Circles in this city held its inaugural meeting at the Pudong Mansion the night before last. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Three documents passed on the spot, including the declaration, the telegram, and the petition to the Third Plenary Session, are excerpted below.</p>
<p>Declaration</p>
<p>In the past twenty years or so, due to the precarious state of the country, some have advocated saving the nation through transportation, and others have advocated saving the nation through education. Since the September 18th Incident, due to the national crisis, people have advocated resisting the enemy to save the nation. However, since the loss of the Eastern Provinces, followed by Rehe, the enemy's forces have crossed the Great Wall to the south, directly entering the suburbs of Peiping and Tianjin. The fate of the country is now extremely critical. The reason for this is that the country has not yet achieved unification, and feudal forces still occupy various regions. For this reason, in the past twenty years or so, we have only seen years of civil war, people unable to support themselves, water conservancy projects not being developed, and natural disasters occurring frequently. There has been more destruction than construction, leading to the decline of all industries and the bankruptcy of rural areas. The enemy has taken advantage of this, resulting in the unprecedented national crisis of the September 18th Incident. For the present, if we want to stop the enemy's invasion and further recover lost territories, we must achieve national unification and centralize power. Even if we want to relieve rural areas, engage in construction, and restore prosperity, unification is essential. As long as local separatist forces exist, not only can civil wars not be stopped and peaceful construction cannot proceed, but also the nation's strength will be consumed in civil war, making external resistance impossible. In the summer of last year, because of the unification of Guangdong and Guangxi, we were able to reject the enemy's harsh demands and resist the invasion of Suiyuan by the bandit army under the enemy's command. Later, the Xi'an Incident occurred, causing the construction efforts in the Northwest over the years to suffer greatly, and the preliminary unification of the country was almost destroyed. Fortunately, the Xi'an Incident has now been peacefully resolved, but there is no need to hide the fact that national unification has not been consolidated and separatist forces still exist. We believe that at this time, when the national crisis is deep and the crisis is imminent, there is no way to save the country without completing the true unification of the nation. To achieve unification, the responsibility of leadership naturally lies with the government. However, if people from all walks of life can unite and use the power of public opinion and morality to jointly impose severe sanctions on traitors and warlords who undermine unification, the unification of the nation will surely become more consolidated day by day. May all the wise people in the country rise together to complete the great cause of national unification.</p>
<p>Telegram</p>
<p>To all newspaper offices and fellow countrymen: The national crisis is severe, reaching its extreme today. The root cause of this is the inability to unify the country, which leads to the dispersal of strength, allowing the enemy to take advantage of gaps and carry out their cunning schemes of devouring and defeating us one by one. The events before the September 18th and January 28th incidents are still vivid in our minds. Recognizing this, various groups in Shanghai have organized the United National Salvation Grand Alliance, which today issues a declaration (see above, omitted). If you agree, please advocate it uniformly, so as to create powerful national public opinion to complete the great cause of national salvation through unification. The nation will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate.</p>
<p>Petition</p>
<p>Petition to the Third Plenary Session: We believe that pacifying the country comes before resisting foreign aggression, and unification is the prerequisite for pacifying the country. Since the resolution of the Guangdong and Guangxi problems, formal unification has been completed, but true unification has not yet been achieved. The occurrence of the Xi'an Incident is sufficient evidence that the country has not yet truly unified. Outside of Xi'an, there is no shortage of signs of feudal separatism, where government orders come from private sources, or military power is equivalent to private property. Local officials are like feudal lords, and when they act on their own impulses, it is the day when internal unrest is brewing. The danger of accumulating firewood under a house is extreme. At this critical time when the national crisis is severe, if we do not quickly seek the unification of government orders and military power, if war cannot be avoided, even if the soldiers at the front have the determination to die, they will not be able to quickly respond to the situation and win victory due to the lack of unification in the rear. Moreover, the outcome of modern warfare depends on the strength of the country's overall power, and the strength of the country's overall power depends on whether its national defense is solid, whether its industry can be mobilized, whether its people are trained, and whether its transportation is convenient and rapid. If each province governs itself, plans related to national defense construction, industrial mobilization, popular training, and military transportation cannot be thoroughly implemented. Moreover, the deployment of troops and the requisition of military supplies cannot be fully in accordance with the wishes of the highest military authorities. Without waiting for the start of the war, the signs of defeat are already visible. We fear that saving the country is merely an elusive hope, while the destruction of the country is an inevitable fact. People from all walks of life in Shanghai, recognizing this, find it difficult to remain silent. Therefore, there is the organization of the United National Salvation Grand Alliance. We all believe that at this time when enemy troops are pressing on the border, we should plan to consolidate the rear and request our central government to assign the National Government to quickly eliminate the remnants of the communist bandits who are causing trouble in the rear, so as to prevent possible disturbances. We should set a deadline to unify the government orders and military power of remote provinces and regions, and not allow the remnants of feudalism who attempt to separate themselves to put on the new disguise of supporting the central government while maintaining their feudal nature. We must strictly punish those who aim to destroy the national united front under the guise of resisting the enemy and saving the country, so that pacifying the country has its actual results and unification is not just an empty name. If adopted, the nation will be fortunate. Speaking frankly, we cannot help but eagerly await orders. Also, in the list of executive committee members of the association published yesterday, due to hasty organization, Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Shao Xubai, Zhang Kebai, Long Peiyun, Ye Xianggao, Gong Yuting, Li Hua, Xu Shushen, Xu Xingchu, Wang Xiaoying, etc. were omitted. This is specially supplemented and recorded.</p>

<h3>The International Radio Station Begins Testing China-Germany Communication</h3>
<p>Initial Voice Quality Good</p>
<p>Shenzhou News reports that the Ministry of Communications, in order to develop China's international telecommunications traffic, previously installed wireless telephone equipment when building the Sino-British radio station. After a long period of testing and completion, in addition to Sino-Japanese wireless telephone communication, which was realized in October 1935, and Sino-U.S. testing was also successful, it will soon be opened. The Ministry has recently prepared to carry out China-Germany communication, and has exchanged views with the German Postal Needs Department of the Ministry of Communications, and has obtained the consent of both parties. Both China and Germany have designated the Shanghai International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications and the German State-Owned Wireless Radio Company in Berlin as the test institutions. After receiving the order, the International Radio Station and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications started the China-Germany testing work yesterday. It is reported that the results are good. Once the test is completed, the communication contract and price will be formally negotiated. It is expected that China-Germany communication can be realized in the first half of this year.</p>
<h3>The Income Tax Office Announces a Deadline for Shops to Declare Deposits</h3>
<p>Deadline is February 28th; Failure to Report Will Be Considered Concealment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held a special committee meeting on income tax yesterday to continue discussing income tax. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Declaration of Deposits</p>
<p>The income from securities deposits under the third category of income tax includes (1) interest on deposits received by banks and money shops, (2) interest on loans from money lending businesses, foreign firms, groups, and individuals to companies and shops. Currently, in addition to banks and money shops deducting interest income on deposits starting from January 1st, shops other than money lending businesses that receive deposits will be notified by the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Office to register the name of the shop, type of business, and office for declaration. It is known that the deadline for this declaration is also February 28th. Failure to report by the deadline will be considered concealment. The interest income on deposits from January 1st of this year should also be subject to income tax deduction and payment in accordance with the general method for money lending businesses.</p>
<p>Answering Questions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in response to inquiries from the Parasol Industry Association regarding the capital portion of shops, stated the following: (1) If a factory had a capital of tens of thousands of yuan when it was established, but due to the commercial depression over the years, not only has the capital been completely lost, but it is also heavily indebted. However, the manager's credit is quite good, so they can borrow and owe externally for turnover. Therefore, on the surface, there is a turnover of tens of thousands of yuan. In this situation, should income tax be levied based on the capital at the time of investment or based on the operating capital at the end of the 25th year? (2) If a commercial factory had a capital of less than 2,000 yuan when it was established, but has made a profit of tens of thousands of yuan in the past few years, is income tax levied based on the capital amount at the time of establishment or based on the capital at the end of the 25th year? The association immediately transferred the matter to accountant Xu Yongzuo for explanation as follows: Article 7 of the Implementing Rules of the Income Tax stipulates that the commonly referred to as capital is the actual invested principal. Therefore, at the initial establishment, the original investment amount can be used as capital. During continuous operation, the capital amount stated on the capital account can be used as capital (but limited to those that have been reported). (Also, according to the draft rules for collection, public reserve funds that have not been transferred to capital are not counted.) Based on this explanation, in the first example, although the original investment has been virtually lost, if the capital amount has not been transferred out of the account, the monthly average amount on the capital account in the 25th year (non-operating capital, because operating capital is not the capital referred to in the tax law) is used as capital. Borrowing from external creditors for turnover has a separate item for loans or other liabilities, which is not related to capital. Also, in the second example, if the capital at the time of establishment was 2,000 yuan, and there were tens of thousands of yuan in profits several years later, if this tens of thousands of yuan in profits is formally transferred to the capital account after being organized at the end of the 25th year, and the Income Tax Office is notified that the capital amount is tens of thousands of yuan, then starting from the 26th year, the capital amount can be calculated as tens of thousands of yuan.</p>
<p>Special Committee Meeting</p>
<p>The Income Tax Special Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held its fourth meeting yesterday. Over twenty people, including Zhu Wenqi, Cai Chengxin, Li Quanshi, Xu Yongzuo, Li Wenjie, Wang Zikang, He Yuanming, Pan Xulun, Jiang Wanping, and Xi Yushu, attended. They continued to discuss the draft collection rules and formulated the following revised articles: (1) Under Article 9, it is proposed to add a proviso and a second item as follows: However, due to factual or customary necessity, only the actual amount received may be counted. Those who have calculated their total revenue in accordance with the proviso of the previous item, if they wish to change to using the text of the previous item to calculate their total revenue in a certain year, they should report to the competent collection agency within three months after the beginning of that year. (2) Under Article 10, it is proposed to add a proviso as follows: However, those who calculate their total revenue in accordance with the proviso of the previous item may only include the expenses that have been paid in the actual expenses.</p>
<h3>Zhu Shaoping Received a Reply from the National Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhu Shaoping of the China Global Student Association previously sent a telegram to congratulate Chairman Lin on his 70th birthday. Mr. Zhu received a reply telegram from the National Government yesterday, which stated, "Your telegram has been read by the Chairman, and he is very grateful for your congratulations." This is specially reported.</p>
<h3>The Xi'an-Lanzhou Section of the Eurasia Shanghai-Xinjiang Route Will First Open a Special Flight Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Original Schedule Will Be Restored Starting Next Week. The Peiping-Guangzhou and Peiping-Hankou Sections Will Resume Flights First.</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Xi'an-Lanzhou section of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Xinjiang route will resume flights. A special flight will be opened tomorrow, and the original schedule will be restored next week. It has been decided to resume flights on the Peiping-Guangzhou line in order, with the Peiping-Hankou section resuming first on the 23rd. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Special Flight for the Xi'an-Lanzhou Section</p>
<p>The Baotou-Lanzhou and Xi'an-Lanzhou sections of the Shanghai-Xinjiang route were suspended due to the Xi'an Incident last year. The company changed the route, diverting the Baotou-Lanzhou section through Peiping, Taiyuan, Baotou, and Ningxia, and the Xi'an-Lanzhou section directly to Chengdu and Kunming via Zhengzhou. After the peaceful resolution of the Xi'an Incident, the company was ordered to resume the original route at the beginning of this month, with a stop at Xi'an. Now, the company has been ordered to resume flights between Xi'an and Lanzhou this week. Due to aircraft allocation, the company decided to open a special flight from Zhengzhou to Lanzhou tomorrow (Thursday) and return from Lanzhou to Zhengzhou on Friday, and restore the original schedule next week to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>Resumption of the Peiping-Guangzhou Route</p>
<p>The company's Peiping-Guangzhou route opened in May of the 23rd year and was doing well. However, the Changsha and other airports were flooded, preventing planes from landing. At the same time, passenger traffic on other routes was high, and there were not enough planes to allocate, so the route was temporarily suspended by order of the Ministry. However, the company considered the importance of this route for north-south transportation and immediately sought to resume operations after the water receded at the Changsha airport. It has been approved by the Ministry of Transportation to resume the Peiping-Hankou section first, which will run from Peiping through Taiyuan and Zhengzhou to Hankou. It is scheduled to open on the 23rd of this month, with two round trips per week from Peiping to Hankou, departing south on Tuesdays and Fridays and returning north on Thursdays and Sundays. Ticket prices and postage will be the same as before. The resumption of the entire line will be decided after the Peiping-Hankou section resumes and the business is assessed.</p>

<h3>The "London Investment Chronicle" Discusses China's New Policy</h3>
<p>Commending Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Minister Kung Hsiang-hsi</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the "London Investment Chronicle" published an article this month entitled "China's New Policies," giving an accurate account of China's financial situation in recent years. The "Shanghai Chinese Daily" reprinted it, but did not disclose the entire article. The full text is translated as follows:</p>
<p>The recent inclusion of completed Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway bonds on the London Stock Exchange is a good omen for those holding Chinese bonds. This event confirms the growing belief that the Chinese government's finances are now guided by a new policy. As is well known, Chinese bonds are divided into three categories: 1) Those with the highest credit, secured by customs revenue, including the 1898 4.5% Anglo-German Loan, the 1925 5% Sino-French Boxer Indemnity Gold Bonds, and the 1913 5% Reorganization Loan. Principal and interest on these bonds have been paid on schedule without interruption. 2) The Salt Gabelle loans secured by the net revenue of the salt tax, including the 1908 4.5% Anglo-French Loan, the 1911 Hukuang Railway Loan, the 1912 Crisp Loan, the 8% Vickers Notes, and the Marconi Notes. The performance of these loans has been less satisfactory. Only the 1908 4.5% Anglo-French Loan has been paid on schedule. The interest on the 1912 Crisp Loan, although paid according to the terms, has been delayed in principal repayment. Now, efforts are being made to double the annual principal repayment to make up for the arrears. The interest on the Vickers Notes and Marconi Notes was suspended after their issuance in 1918-19 and was not resumed until the end of 1936. 3) Railway loans, of which only the 1899 5% Peiping-Shanhaikwan Railway Loan has been paid on schedule. The others have been delayed for varying periods. However, the authorities have now agreed to continue paying a portion of the interest in accordance with the 1936 reorganization plan.</p>
<p>Overall, the above-mentioned loans were all issued in the 19th century, although some were actually issued in the 20th century. A large batch of loans was issued directly for railway construction in the 19th century, and a large portion of the non-railway loans were also used for railway development. In the past, the most reliable loans were guaranteed by foreign administrative agencies within the most reliable government institutions. Even the government itself could not hope to find such guarantees. Now, this principle has been abolished. Therefore, the risks associated with loans in recent years have been greater than usual. Since 1928-29, the Nationalist government established in Nanjing, which advocated nationalism, has seemed to shake the foreign administrative agencies managing customs revenue. The Salt Gabelle Inspectorate has actually been transferred from foreign hands to Chinese control. Before and after the establishment of the Nanjing government, internal disturbances made it impossible to carry out railway reorganization or improvement. At that time, the government was in a period of turmoil and could not care about the future of the loans. It even demanded the abolition of extraterritoriality, which caused unease among those holding Chinese bonds.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the National Government has made bright progress after the initial turbulent period. Today, the generals in North China all obey the central government, and the Guangzhou government, which intended to be independent, no longer exists after the bloodless revolution in September 1936. Therefore, in terms of politics, the Chinese government is now capable of reorganizing its internal affairs, and its financial affairs are also gradually turning from bad to good. The Japanese aggression on the coast and the Communist insurgency in the interior have actually helped to achieve this. It is particularly noteworthy that neither of these threats has weakened the Chinese government's international reputation. Even the strong Japanese aggression in North China seems to have backfired and ended early. The violent militarists in Tokyo are surprised by China's resistance. Japan once believed that it should be responsible for guiding China's economic development. This view now seems to need to be changed. In 1935, Japan demanded that China allow it to occupy a special position in all matters relating to China's external economic relations. When Sir Otto Niemeyer, representing the British Treasury, visited China to investigate China's finances, Japanese newspapers openly expressed hostile remarks. Shortly after, when there was a proposal for a loan, the newspapers arbitrarily criticized it without reservation. On November 5, 1935, the Chinese government resolutely ordered the abandonment of its ancient silver standard and implemented the legal tender (fapi) policy. Japan suspected that this move was the result of a conspiracy between the British Treasury and the United States. Japan's intimidation ultimately failed to stop China's preparations for its domestic development. Last year, China's plan to reorganize long-overdue railway loans gradually restored China's overseas credit. As a result, Chinese railway bonds have the possibility of re-entering the London market. Recently, on January 12, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway bonds issued in Shanghai were included on the London Stock Exchange. This move may be enough to glimpse the people's hearts here. It is expected that new loans will be established one after another. The British Export Credits Guarantee Department's special attention to the Chinese market and the dispatch of representatives to Shanghai are sufficient to indicate that the British government no longer opposes Chinese loans.</p>
<p>From this point of view, investors can now be said to have escaped the panic of the past decade and can believe that the Chinese government is now striving to eliminate the main factors of risk contained in Chinese bonds. The breadth of the Chinese government's jurisdiction today is unmatched by any recent government, so there is no longer any fear of internal disturbances or the interception of customs revenue. The excessive nationalism that once threatened the security of the customs is now no longer a danger because the Chinese government has made it clear that it is willing to keep the customs under foreign management. This move by the Chinese government is indeed a special strength, and the credit it has gained as a result is immense. Furthermore, the Chinese government's resistance to the threats of Japan and the Communists, which is unexpectedly resolute, is also sufficient to enhance its credit.</p>
<p>Today, China's need is to continue the current policy. It is hoped that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will continue to hold the great power of the leader of his government, so that this policy can be guaranteed to continue. However, detailed work still depends on Minister Kung's careful planning to win the trust of the people. This is also an important goal. Minister Kung's painstaking efforts last year to restore the credit of Chinese loans have been praised by the London financial community. Therefore, they all hope that he will continue to manage China's finances. If the development that began in 1936 can continue for several years under the leadership of Minister Kung, then China's growing credit in London will enable China to raise funds in London when it needs to borrow money for its great development. Even today, investors holding a large number of Japanese bonds may be considering whether it would be better to exchange some of them for Chinese bonds.</p>
<h3>The Fishery Syndicate Investigates the Status of Coastal Fisheries in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Shenjiamen's Annual Fish Catch is Worth 15 Million Yuan. Further Investigations Will Be Conducted Along the Coasts of Fujian, Guangdong, Shandong, and Other Provinces.</p>
<p>The Fishery Loan Syndicate, jointly established by the Ministry of Industry and twelve banks including the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, has set the establishment date on March 1. Its organizational regulations have been passed by the third preparatory meeting and are awaiting approval from the Ministry of Industry. All procedures for the establishment are being handled by the preparatory committee members Qian Xinzhi, Wang Zhixin, and Gui Yanfang in recent days. It is also planned to invite Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, to Shanghai to give instructions at that time. The office will still be located at the original site of the preparatory office. It is reported that the 120,000 yuan loan previously granted by the Xinhua and other three banks to the Shanghai Fish Market for re-lending to fresh fish merchants has been repaid by 30,000 yuan. The unpaid amount will be transferred to the syndicate when it is established. As for the syndicate's investigation of the situation in various fishing areas, the investigations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been completed. In the future, representatives will be sent to Fujian, Guangdong, Shandong, and other provinces for investigation. The fishing conditions of the Zhoushan Islands in Zhejiang are recorded below:</p>
<p>Fishing Conditions</p>
<p>Shenjiamen is located at the eastern end of Zhoushan Island and is a fishing center with more than 3,700 households and more than 16,300 people. Approximately 70% to 80% of the population is engaged in fishing or fishing as a secondary occupation. The island is relatively large, with approximately 600 acres of farmland that can be cultivated with rice, sweet potatoes, and other grains. In addition to local residents and people from this province, there are also people from Fujian and other provinces who go there for fishing. According to estimates by local fish warehouses, the annual fish catch is worth approximately 15 million yuan, with small yellow croaker accounting for the largest share, approximately 35%. Ribbonfish is the second largest, approximately 25%, followed by large yellow croaker, cuttlefish, crabs, eels, etc. The fishermen's income is sold by the fish warehouses, either processed or transported to other places by iced vessels. Most of them are sold to various ports in this province, accounting for approximately 40% of the total. Sales to Jiangsu and Shanghai account for 28%, Guangdong accounts for 20%, Fujian accounts for 10%, and other regions account for 2%.</p>
<p>Fishermen's Lives</p>
<p>The fishing boats in this area are all old-fashioned, and the large pair trawlers for catching small yellow croaker are the main tools, numbering 800 pairs. There are 1,170 large trawlers for catching large yellow croaker, 1,800 red-head trawlers, 1,280 drift nets, 200 seine nets, and 580 fishing boats. The fishermen go out to sea every year from the Mid-Autumn Festival, catching small yellow croaker from Liuheng Island and Taohua Island to the north. During the Minor Snow solar term, they go to the Shengsi Islands to catch hairtail. By the Winter Solstice, they return to the vicinity of Shenjiamen to catch pomfret. From the Qingming Festival to the Beginning of Summer, they catch small yellow croaker in Shengsi. From the Beginning of Summer to Taishan and Changtu, they catch large yellow croaker. In June and July, they mostly stop working to repair boats and nets. Therefore, their lives are very hard, and some people work all year round without getting enough to eat.</p>
<p>Welcome Loans</p>
<p>The fishermen's economic situation is extremely difficult. Therefore, each time they go out to sea, they rely on the assistance of the fish warehouses, and the fish warehouses rely on the banks and native banks. Before the Bank of China had an office there, it lent approximately 50,000 yuan in the 23rd year. The Ningbo native banks lent a large amount of money. However, since the financial turmoil occurred in Ningbo in the 24th year, 7.2 million yuan was withdrawn at once, and the Bank of China also stopped lending. Fortunately, the fish warehouses had sufficient capital, so the fishing industry was not affected. However, their conditions for fishermen are very harsh. After the fishermen borrow money, the fish they catch must be sold by the fish warehouses, which charge a commission of 5%. As for the interest rate, it is 25 yuan per hundred yuan for long-term loans and 2% per month for short-term loans. Therefore, the fishermen were very happy to learn that the syndicate would provide loans at low interest rates. There is a fishery production cooperative in this area with only 20 members engaged in freshwater fish farming. However, the capital is insufficient, and the results are not good.</p>
<h3>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xiamen-Philippines Route Will Open Next Month</h3>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's designation of the "Haiheng" vessel to operate the Xiamen-Philippines route has been reported repeatedly in newspapers. However, the news of a postponement of the opening of the route was reported in various newspapers yesterday. After inquiring with the company, the information was confirmed. It is said that since this is the first time a foreign route is being opened, every effort must be made to improve all the equipment on the ship. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the overseas Chinese in the Philippines are widely aware of the route, it is necessary to make extensive announcements in advance. Currently, these procedures have not been fully completed. Taking advantage of this preparation time, the "Haiheng" vessel will be temporarily ordered to sail to Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Once everything is ready, the opening of the route will be scheduled, and it is expected to be next month. The vessel is new and does not need to be repaired. The rumors that the postponement of the opening of the route is due to business reasons are not true.</p>

<h3>Xue Xiangyun is Willing to Go to Zhenru for Examination to Determine if She Has Ever Had Children</h3>
<p>The Case Was Originally Submitted with Anonymous Letters from Both Parties. The Judge Forbade Public Attendance Because the Case Concerned Public Morality.</p>
<p>Xu Liangchen, a real estate merchant residing at No. 2, Lane 106, Maitehesi Tuo Road, previously married Xue Xiangyun, the daughter of the dye merchant Xue Baorun, and they have been married for more than ten years. Recently, Wang Yongquan, a former chauffeur of the Xue family, requested the First Special Court's Civil Division to confirm that his son, Wang Genbao, was Xue Xiangyun's biological son. After the trial, the court ruled against Wang Yongquan. Now, Xu and Xue (i.e., Xiangyun) have hired lawyers Ossen and Tang Shenpei to accuse Wang Yongquan and Wang Genbao of libel, perjury, and fraud. After a preliminary hearing, Xu and Xue voluntarily requested a forensic examination by Dr. Wei Ligong to prove that she had never had children. However, the court, in order to demonstrate fairness and comply with the ministry's order that a woman's body should be examined by a female forensic doctor, ordered Xu and Xue to go to the court on the morning of the 14th of this month and submit a document to the female forensic doctor of the Shanghai Local Court for examination. This has been reported in this newspaper. However, the date was changed, and Xu and Xue did not go to the court, so the examination has not been carried out yet. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, Judge Zhong Qing of the Second Criminal Division of the court continued the hearing of the case. Many people were present in the courtroom. First, Judge Zhong questioned Xu and Xue as to why they did not go to the court for examination. According to Xu, although she could be examined by a female forensic doctor of the Local Court, she was still afraid of being attacked by others, so she voluntarily requested to go to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute established by the Ministry of Justice for examination. Chen Wen, the defendant's lawyer, immediately argued that the previous court order required the plaintiff to go to the female forensic doctor's office of the Local Court for examination. If the plaintiff did not agree with the ruling, she could appeal according to the law. Now, the plaintiff not only did not go for the examination but also requested another examination, which was a sign of contempt for the law and resistance to the court order. Judge Zhong ruled that since the plaintiff voluntarily requested to go to the Forensic Research Institute for examination, it was legally permissible. Then, the plaintiff's lawyer presented an anonymous letter, saying that it was received after the previous adjournment of the case. The defendant's lawyer also presented an anonymous letter, saying that the adjournment of the case was requested because the defendant's side was currently collecting evidence. The evidence is now in Hankou, and it takes time to travel back and forth. Even if the evidence cannot prove that Xu and Xue are Wang Genbao's biological mother, it can at least prove the relationship between Xu and Xue and Wang Yongquan. After reviewing the letters presented by both parties, the court was shocked and angered. Because the case concerned public morality, it declared that public attendance was prohibited. Therefore, the content of the interrogation could not be known. As a result, the case was adjourned for questioning.</p>
<h3>Xu Qizhong's Romantic Bankruptcy Ends</h3>
<p>Bankrupt Property Distributed According to the Mediation Plan. Creditors Have Already Collected Their Payments.</p>
<p>The Xu Qizhong romantic bankruptcy case, which caused a sensation, was only resolved after the third creditors' meeting convened by the First Special Court passed the mediation plan and reached a settlement. Subsequently, the court issued a public notice. Because no creditors raised objections during the notice period, the court specially ordered the bankruptcy administrator, accountant Wang Sifang, to distribute the funds according to the mediation plan as soon as possible to close the case. The original order of the First Special Court is recorded below: Order No. 13637 orders Xu Qizhong's bankruptcy administrator, accountant Yu Sifang, to submit a document on October 1, 25, to submit the distribution list for Xu Qizhong's bankruptcy case and to ask for verification and compliance. The document and three copies of the distribution list, and one copy of the revised creditor list, are all accepted and duly announced in accordance with the law. No creditors have raised objections during the notice period. You are hereby ordered to distribute the funds according to the list and report for verification. This order is from President Guo Yunguan. After receiving the order, accountant Wang immediately complied with the order and transported all the bankrupt property together with the bankrupt to fulfill the mediation plan, and delivered the cash and stocks, etc., distributed the funds according to the list, and sent notices to the creditors, ordering them to bring their seals and go to collect the payments. After receiving the notices, the creditors, such as Sincere, Hengxiang, and Ying Huizhen, the female owner of the Wendi brothel, have already collected their payments. As of recently, only Wang Bingzhong, Fuyuan Native Bank, Wang Yuanchen, and Dongxinglou Restaurant are left. The payments that these households should receive have now been transferred to the court for collection. At this point, the case has come to a complete end, and the bankruptcy administrator has reported to the court.</p>
<h3>The Perpetrators of Throwing Stolen Goods and Making False Accusations Are Sentenced</h3>
<p>Li Xiaoshi, the former leader of the Ximen squad of the Investigation Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and investigators Jin Yushan and squad leader Lü Jinchun, colluded with bandits to rob the police of their handguns and then threw the stolen goods to frame innocent people. The former leader of the First Squad, Liang Yu, captured the bandits Xu Xueqin and others. Li Xiaoshi and Jin Yushan fled their posts in fear of punishment. Lü Jinchun and his accomplices Yang Futang, Xin Kun, and Xin Dahuzi were arrested and transferred to the Local Court. After interrogation by Judge Wu Xiangzu, it was announced yesterday that Lü Jinchun was sentenced to five years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights for jointly abusing the power of public officials and falsely accusing the public officials in charge with the intention of causing others to be criminally punished. Yang Futang was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for possessing military firearms and ammunition with the intention of providing them for others to commit crimes.

<h3>Secret Plot to Assassinate Government Official Gong Chunpu Recants</h3>
<p>The Police Charge Him with Conspiracy to Murder, Gong Denies Involvement, Court Hearing Adjourned for Further Investigation</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the League of Nations dispatched a fact-finding mission led by Lord Lytton to China.  Upon arrival in Shanghai, they resided at the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. At that time, Wang Yaqiao and other leaders of an assassination group plotted to murder important government officials. They rented room 511 at the</p>
<p>Cathay Hotel and possessed three hand grenades, two pistols, and thirty-nine bullets. However, they failed to find a suitable opportunity to carry out their plan. Subsequently, the Public Concession Police successively arrested twenty-three individuals involved in the case, including Long Lin. Long Lin, Tang Ming, and others provided detailed confessions about the matter, implicating Long Chunpu, also known as Duanpu, a native of Xiangyin, Hunan, as a key member of Wang Yaqiao's group in charge of finances. After Long and the others were taken away by the inland</p>
<p>officials, the Xinzha Police arrested Zhang Quncheng (also known as Peng Guoyao) and Li Sude (also known as Hu Ruian), who also confessed to being involved in the plot. Zhang and Li were later sentenced to twenty years imprisonment by the First Special District Court and handed over to the inland authorities. Recently, Lao Zha Police Detective Pang Ruiqing and Li Shugui discovered that Xi had arrived in Shanghai. Consequently, they arrested Gong at 978 Baker Road and sent him to the First Special District Court, which ordered a postponement of the hearing. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the criminal division chief of the First Special District Court,</p>
<p>presided over a continued hearing in the First Criminal Court. Ru Bao-yi, the lawyer representing the police, stated that based on previous confessions, the defendant Gong Chunpu was involved in the plot to assassinate government officials. Therefore, he was charged with preparing to commit robbery and endangering public safety under Article 27, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code. However, the crime occurred between March 20th and 23rd, 1932. At that time, the Criminal Code did not have provisions for the crime of preparing to commit murder. Therefore, the court should decide whether the current charges are appropriate.  Gong Chunpu testified that in 1931, while living at No. 62 Jianye Lane on Route Ghisi,</p>
<p>his distant cousin, Gong Xianglin, introduced him to Long Lin. Later, Long borrowed 500 yuan from him, which he refused. He did not know Zhang Yucheng or Li Sude well. When the court asked if Tang Ming had ever lived in his house, he replied that he had not.  The court asked him about his confession to the police that Chen Ming-shu had instructed Wang Yaqiao to use fake bombs to create fear and express public dissatisfaction. Gong replied that this was a misunderstanding by the police. He only mentioned that Chen's secretary had told him about it, not that he knew about it because he participated in the plot. The court adjourned the hearing for one week to retrieve the case files.</p>
<h3>Embezzling a Large Sum of Money from the Shop and Falsely Reporting a Robbery</h3>
<p>Tying His Hands and Slashing His Face to Pretend He Was Robbed, Detectives Reveal the Truth, Sentencing Scheduled</p>
<p>Yang Xiaodi, a 52-year-old native of Suzhou residing at No. 7 Liuzhi Lane, Tanziawan, Zhabei, had been working as a shop clerk at the Fuxin Flour Mill on West Suzhou Road for over twenty years. On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, at 3:30 PM, the factory needed to issue wages and instructed Yang to go to the head office on Jiangxi Road to collect 4,000 yuan in legal tender from the Zhongnan Bank.  Unexpectedly, Yang reported a robbery to the Xinzha Police. After investigation by detectives Wu Changkai and Ding Huaguo, it was discovered that Yang had</p>
<p>falsely reported the robbery. Yang was detained and sent to the First Special District Court, with a request for detention. This was already reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Shan Chuanlin continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a public prosecution based on Article 169 of the Criminal Code for false accusation and Article 336, Paragraph 1 for embezzlement of business assets. He also recounted the investigation process, stating that during the adjournment, the defendant firmly denied and refused to reveal the truth at the police station. After investigation, the detectives confirmed that it was a false report and found a bicycle. It was discovered that the defendant</p>
<p>knew a barber, Sanliuzi, in Tanziawan. Two months ago, the defendant borrowed 20 yuan from Sanliuzi. Sanliuzi also knew that the defendant was a shop clerk at the Fuxin Factory and often went to collect money. They jointly planned to have Yang notify Sanliuzi when he was going to withdraw money. Therefore, the defendant notified Sanliuzi this time, who gathered his accomplices Yi Jingen and Changjiao. They met in room 217 of the Tianran Hotel on Zhifu Road. After getting the money, the four of them would divide it equally. On that day, Yang Xiaodi</p>
<p>collected 4,000 yuan in legal tender and rode his bicycle directly to the Tianran Hotel. He handed over all the money to Xuan Jingen. Then, he went with Sanliuzi, Changjiao, and others to Shanchang Lane on Carter Road. They abandoned the bicycle in the alley and then hired a Xiang Sheng taxi by phone. They drove to the opposite side of the Zhaofeng Garden and got out of the car. They went to a deserted field, where they tied Yang's hands with rope, and Changjiao slashed Yang's face to avoid suspicion. Yang then pretended to be robbed and cried for help. A rickshaw puller passed by and took him to the police station to report the incident. Furthermore, witness</p>
<p>Zhang Genyang, a driver from Xiang Sheng Taxi Company, and Wu Jinchang, a bookkeeper from Fuxin Factory, proved the incident. When questioned, the defendant also confessed to conspiring with Sanliuzi, Changjiao, Xuan Jingen, and others, stating that each person would get 1,000 yuan, but the money was taken by Xuan and he did not receive a cent. Finally, the lawyer from the police requested a heavy sentence for the defendant. The court debate in this case concluded, and sentencing is scheduled for the 20th.</p>
<h3>Guanshengyuan Farm's Plum Blossom, Calligraphy, and Goldfish Exhibition</h3>
<p>The plum blossom, calligraphy, and goldfish joint exhibition organized by the Caohejing Guanshengyuan Farm opened on the 11th of this month. Hundreds of pots of plum blossoms from famous public and private gardens, hundreds of pieces of calligraphy and paintings by famous figures of ancient and modern times, and hundreds of varieties of rare goldfish from the farm are on display, creating a spectacular sight.  A Song plum tree, a rare treasure, is also planted in the venue. In the mild cold of spring, the flowers are in full bloom on the branches, with sparse shadows and faint fragrance. Therefore, in recent days, people from all walks of life have been visiting in groups, with hundreds of visitors every day.  The sight of fluttering skirts and a constant stream of cars and horses is truly magnificent. Taking a trip to the suburbs on such a sunny day can relax the body and mind and breathe fresh air.  It's not just about admiring the plum blossoms, calligraphy, and goldfish.</p>
<h3>Lan Society Inaugural Meeting</h3>
<p>People from Lanxi, Zhejiang, who reside in Shanghai, have recently been developing rapidly. It has been learned that Xu Rongfang and others have initiated the organization of the Lan Society.

To clarify matters for all sectors, the committee has scheduled a reception for the press and participating manufacturers in this city at the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 20th of this month to report on all aspects.</p>
<h3>Outcome of the Third Appeal in the Li Jinxiang Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Only Chen A'er Gets a Retrial, Fang Dalang's Appeal Rejected, Dies from Severe Illness</p>
<p>Li Jinxiang, the only son of Li Guanlin, a resident of Li's Family Village, Remy Road in the French Concession, was six years old this year.  On the evening of May 13, 1935, at around 7:00 PM, kidnappers suddenly knocked on the door, falsely claiming to be asking Li Guanlin to treat a child's illness for his elderly daughter.  They entered the house, abducted Jinxiang, and hid him, demanding 50,000 yuan for his release.  The case was reported to the French police, who investigated and solved it after about a month.  The kidnappers Zhao Tao-tao, Dong A-qing, Dong A-qing, Chen Jinsheng, Wang Jinxiang, Yang Shaobai, Fang Dalang, Su Zhaogen, Yang Hongde, and suspects Xu Weiming, Ji Xiucheng, Jin Heshang, Ding A-liu, and others, twelve in total, were arrested.</p>
<p>It was also discovered that Chen A'er, also known as Chen Rongxiang, a tailor from Pudong and Li Guanlin's brother-in-law, was the mastermind.  He posed as the victim's representative to negotiate the ransom with the kidnappers to pass on information. Therefore, Chen was also arrested.  After rescuing the kidnapped Li Jinxiang from Jiangxinsha in Pudong, the prisoners were sent to the Second Special District Court, where the French Concession Prosecutor's Office filed charges in accordance with the law.  The result of the trial was that Chen A'er was sentenced to 15 years, Dong A-qing to 12 years, Zhao Tao-tao, Wang Jinxiang, and Fang Dalang to 10 years each, Chen Jinsheng and Yang Shaobai to 7 years each, and Yang Hongde</p>
<p>to 5 years, and Su Zhaogen to 1 year. Xu Weiming, Ji Xiucheng, Jin Heshang, and Ding A-liu were acquitted. Of these sentences, only Hongde and Su Zhaogen did not appeal and were executed. The remaining individuals appealed to the High Court Third Branch. The result was that the original sentences for Zhao Tao-tao and Chen Jinsheng were upheld, and the remaining sentences were changed. Wang Jinxiang and Yang Shaobai were acquitted, Chen A'er and Dong A-qing each had their sentences reduced to 10 years, and Fang Dalang had his sentence reduced to 8 years. However, Zhao Tao-tao, Chen A'er, Fang Dalang, and Dong A-qing were still</p>
<p>dissatisfied with the judgment and filed a second appeal with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reviewed the entire case file and determined that the evidence for the crimes of Zhao Tao-tao, Fang Dalang, and Dong A-qing was sufficient and rejected their appeals.  The original judgment against Chen A'er was overturned because the court believed that Chen was related to the victim and went to inquire after the incident. The victim requested that Chen represent him in negotiations with the kidnappers. Aside from the confessions of the criminals Zhao Tao-tao, Fang Dalang, Yang Hongde, etc., there was no</p>
<p>affirmative proof. The original trial did not conduct a detailed investigation, and the facts were not clear. Therefore, the case was remanded to the High Court Third Branch for a retrial. After receiving the case file, the High Court Third Branch held an investigative hearing yesterday, presided over by Judge Chen Daqi.  The appellant Chen A'er and co-defendant Zhao Tao-tao were brought to court, and the victims Li Guanlin and his wife and the investigating detectives Zhong Benchang and Dai Rongji were</p>
<p>summoned to court for investigation and questioning. Chen categorically denied participating in the kidnapping, claiming to have been falsely accused. He hired lawyer Yao Yunbo to defend him. The court adjourned the hearing for a later date. Chen was returned to the detention center, and Zhao was sent back to prison. Fang Dalang, a criminal who also filed a third appeal, was seriously ill in prison. After receiving the judgment rejecting his third appeal, he was shocked, and his condition worsened. He died on the morning of the 15th. The prison reported the death to the court for verification and notified his family to collect the body.</p>
<h3>Hongchang Pawnshop Accused of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Ring Not Yet Due, Already Forfeited Upon Redemption Attempt</p>
<p>Wu Yunfu, a native of Nantong residing at No. 6 Tongfu Lane, Jufuda Road in the French Concession, borrowed a diamond ring worth 2,270 yuan from the wife of Fan Liangbo on December 14, 1935, due to urgent financial need. He pawned it for 500 yuan at the Hongchang Pawnshop, No. 1 Hong Deli, at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Julai Road. At that time, the term was set at twelve months. When the term expired, he went to redeem it, but the pawnshop had already forfeited it according to the regulations printed on the pawn ticket that</p>
<p>the term was eight months. Wu claimed that the pawn ticket was stamped with a twelve-month expiration date. The pawnshop was trying to swallow and embezzle the ring. He first reported it to the French police, but it could not be resolved. Wu Yunfu then hired lawyer Ge Zhitan to file a complaint with the Second Special District Court, accusing Chen Yaoming, a Chaozhou native, shareholder and manager of the Hongchang Pawnshop, of embezzlement. He also filed a civil lawsuit to recover the original item, etc. Judge Chen Shuo-ying held a hearing. These facts have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, they were summoned again, and both parties came to court with their lawyers. The plaintiff</p>
<p>presented several pawn tickets that he had pawned to the defendant's shop from relatives and friends as evidence. The pawn tickets were stamped with a rectangular stamp indicating one year (i.e., twelve months). He claimed that he urgently needed money at the time and had his wife borrow the ring from Mrs. Fanbo of Jumin Lane. When it was time to redeem it, he had no money to redeem it because the Fan family was pressing him. He handed the pawn ticket to the Fan family, who transferred it to a jewelry broker to sell the ring. When he went to redeem it, it had already been forfeited by the defendant's shop. He requested attention to the twelve-month stamp on the pawn ticket.  The defendant, Chen Yaoming, stated that in 1935, the shop only had stamps for six months and eighteen months, but not for thirteen months. If a customer wanted to extend the term to twelve months, it would be written on the pawn ticket and stamped with a perforation stamp as proof. It was not until 1936 that a twelve-month stamp was used. The court reviewed the testimony and determined that further investigation was necessary, and adjourned the hearing for a later date.</p>
<h3>British Girl Missing</h3>
<p>The Second Section of the Municipal Police Bureau received a letter from the Diswei Road Police Station stating that a British girl, Halbin (transliteration), 19 years old, 5 feet tall, wearing a brown coat, recently came to Shanghai and is unfamiliar with the area. She suddenly went missing yesterday. In addition to notifying the French police to pay attention, a corresponding letter is hereby sent to your bureau to order all subordinate branches to pay attention to the search, etc. Section Chief Hong then issued a telephone order to all subordinate branches to pay attention.</p>
<h3>Du, Chief Prosecutor of the District Court, Took Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Du Baoqi, a native of Fujian and the newly appointed Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court, arrived at the court to take office yesterday morning.

<h3>Zheng Baozhao to Return North After Investigating the Rice Shortage in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Reported Findings to the Ministry of Finance by Telegraph</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Zheng Baozhao, Director of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, traveled from Shanghai in the middle of last month to Anhui Province, followed by Hubei and Hunan, to conduct on-site investigations to effectively regulate the surplus and deficit of grain in various parts of the country. Due to the severe rice shortage in Guangdong Province, he re-entered Guangdong from Hunan to investigate. Recently, the reporter of the Xin Xin News Agency learned that Mr. Zheng had completed his investigation in Guangdong. In addition to reporting the rice shortage in Guangdong to the Ministry of Finance, he also presented opinions on how to transport rice from Hunan and Anhui to Guangdong for regulation so that domestic rice could be transported and sold in a timely manner, preventing congestion in the producing areas and preventing grain shortages from recurring in the areas in need, thereby benefiting the national economy in both aspects.

He is expected to arrive in Shanghai within a month and then go to Beijing to report the investigation findings and request instructions on handling matters from Finance Minister Kong.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow-Countrymen Association Seeks Opinions of Shanghai-Based Gentry</h3>
<p>Regarding Matters to be Promoted and Reformed, to Facilitate Deliberations in the County</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow-Countrymen Association in this city received a letter from the Yin County Government, which stated that it received a training order from the Zhejiang Provincial Government Secretariat No. 812, instructing to convene several respected gentry on a regular basis to inquire about the hardships and hopes of the people and to deliberate on matters to be promoted and reformed, etc. Upon receipt of this order, it was decided to invite the local gentry in the county to come to the government office at 1:00 PM on the 19th of this month to hold a meeting. However, there are quite a few gentry from this county residing in Shanghai who care about their hometown. Inviting them to the county for discussion would be troublesome and inconvenient for their business. Therefore, this letter is sent to request your association to consult them nearby and forward all opinions in writing to the county in advance for deliberation. It is truly a matter of public interest. After the association approved the letter, it sent letters to Shanghai-based gentry Zhang Yongni, Gao Yunlu, Xin Zunian, Zhang Jiguang, Yuan Bianyuan, Yuan Ludeng, Jin Tingsun, Zhou Zongliang, Mao Heyuan and others yesterday morning to seek their opinions and asked them to reply to the association within seven days so that they could be forwarded to the county government.</p>
<h3>Oxford Group Holds Spiritual Retreat</h3>
<p>Aimed at Transforming Lives</p>
<p>The Oxford Group held a four-day spiritual retreat at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road during the Lunar New Year. About 70 men and women from various countries attended, including government officials, faculty and students from five universities, Chinese and foreign doctors and pastors, Chinese and foreign journalists, and representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors. They gathered together harmoniously like family members, sharing the revolutionary Christian spirit, seeking to transform lives, and further seeking solutions to social enterprises and international issues in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Oxford Group Movement was initiated 20 years ago by Dr. Buchman, a secretary of the American YMCA, but its source was at Oxford University in England, hence the name. This group has been popular in major cities in Europe and the United States for a while and began to spread to China six years ago. There are many such groups in various parts of China now. The four creeds for living and dealing with the world are: ㊀ Absolute Honesty, ㊁ Absolute Purity, ㊂ Absolute Unselfishness, ㊃ Absolute Love. Its purpose is to use individual evangelism to make everyone cultivate their souls, extend themselves to others, and save everyone, which coincides with the university's saying of "cultivating oneself, regulating one's family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world." The Oxford Group in this city holds weekly meetings in the West District, North District, Central District, and South Gate, respectively. Saint John's University, Fudan University, the National Medical College, Soochow University, the American School, and the Western Children's Public School of the Municipal Council all have its presence. A spiritual retreat is held once or twice every year. The one held at the New Asia Hotel at the beginning of the Lunar New Year was the fourth. Miss Webb-Peploe, a British missionary who has been preaching in Xi'an, Shaanxi for 22 years, also took the opportunity to participate while she was in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>British Tram Workers' Strike Mediated Yesterday</h3>
<p>Opinions Somewhat Closer, Further Discussions Expected Today</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, after Shanghai Tram Company's ticket sellers and drivers from the Public Concession, requested improvements in treatment, they elected two representatives on the 15th to negotiate directly with the company. Because there was no result, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Yu Yaoqiu was sent by the Municipal Party Department, Zhu Guilin was sent by the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhu Xuefan, chairman of the General Labor Union, and Gong Yuting, member, went to the general manager's office of the head office on North Suzhou Road to meet with General Manager Evans and Traffic Manager Pollock to mediate.

However, regarding the issue of wage increases, the company only allowed a two-yuan increase for ticket sellers with a monthly wage of 20 yuan. The maximum amount was originally 32 yuan, but now it can be increased to 25 yuan. However, the party and government representatives believed that ticket sellers and drivers were not treated equally, and that those above 22 yuan were not universally increased. Therefore, it is necessary to consult the workers' opinions before setting a date for continued mediation at 3:00 PM this afternoon.</p>

<p>Awaiting Mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>The Hengfeng Silk Weaving Factory at No. 23 Haizhou Road in the East Shanghai District employs a total of 300 male and female workers.

Because the company refused to accept these conditions, they sent six representatives at 11:00 AM yesterday to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that the eight measures be submitted to the company for implementation. Section Member Wang Xianqing of the Third Section received them and promised to send someone to investigate and verify the matter immediately.

Other by-products, such as millet, sorghum, potatoes, etc., are also a major source of food for the people, but due to the scorching sun, many were not planted, and when the rice was about to ripen, it was hit by floods. All those bordering the four major river basins of Minjiang, Tuojiang, Jialing, and Gouzi were turned into swamps, and fields and huts were washed away. As a result, the average harvest was only 30-40%. The people's livelihood was already difficult, but unexpectedly, since winter, the drought has struck again. There has been no rain for several months, and soybeans and wheat have not been harvested. Grass roots and tree bark have been dug up and eaten. Even well springs have dried up, and water must be fetched from several or dozens of miles away. Within a year, three strange disasters have occurred. Thousands of famine victims have formed groups and begged from door to door. The young and strong have resorted to robbery, and the old and weak have rolled into ditches and waited for death. The number of disaster-stricken counties has reached 109, and the scale of the disaster and the extent of the disaster area are unprecedented in decades and rare in the country. (Omitted) It is believed that the government, as the highest authority in the country, should find a way to provide relief. Therefore, representatives are sent to Beijing to petition, asking for prompt discussion and deliberation on good methods to relieve the 70 million people of Sichuan who are suffering.</p>

<h3>Gen Tai Factory Sues to Confirm Lease Rights of Sealed Property</h3>
<p>Hu Yangsu, legal representative of the China Gen Tai Yiji Hehe Flour Factory, hired lawyer Li Lin to sue Guohua Bank and Chen Zhuqing, etc., in the local court to confirm that the sealed property has lease rights and should not be moved after the auction. The petition stated that the plaintiff leased the factory premises and buildings of the China Gen Tai Hehe Flour Factory, including the entire business trademark and trade name, from Cheng Linsheng, the factory owner, on March 25, 1935, for a period of 20 years, paying an annual rent of 4,000 yuan. Lawyer Li Shirui, who has passed away, certified the lease agreement. After the lease, the defendants, etc., held creditor's rights against the lessor China Gen Tai Factory and Cheng Linsheng, that is, Guohua Bank and Chen Zhuqing, and successively sealed the above-mentioned assets among the leased properties. Recently, they have also been carrying out valuation and auction procedures. The plaintiff has been using the sealed assets for a long time to operate the factory. The livelihoods of more than 70 workers in the former China Gen Tai Factory depend on this. Moreover, the seal record of the defendant Guohua Bank on April 12, 1935, not only detailed the plaintiff's name but also noted the current tenant, etc. The defendant Chen Zhuqing's seal was also the same. Therefore, according to the provisions of Article 425 of the Civil Code, no matter who the ownership of the sealed property is transferred to due to the auction, the lease right should continue to exist and cannot be moved away from the factory due to the auction. Otherwise, the livelihoods of all the factory workers will be cut off as a result. Therefore, it is requested that the court confirm that the plaintiff has lease rights to the various assets of the China Gen Tai Hehe Flour Factory sealed by the defendants, that they should not be moved after the auction, and that they should be marked in the auction announcement, etc. Judge Wang Yijun held a court session yesterday. The defendants hired lawyers Yuan Xingyuan and Wang Xintang, etc., claiming that the litigants were not qualified because the defendants were not the new owners and had no relationship with the plaintiff. This lawsuit can only be filed against the new owners after the auction. The questioner asked that the litigation fees have not yet been fully paid and will be re-tried after a separate order is issued to pay the balance.</p>

<h3>Thief Injures Old Quartermaster in Failed Theft</h3>
<p>Li Changsheng, a local resident of No. 18 Xilin Lane, Xilin Road, Nanshi, who opened Li Guiji Bean Sprout Shop, was suddenly broken into by three thieves with sharp weapons at 5 am yesterday. They entered through a hole dug in the wall in front. The shop's old quartermaster, Chen Shutian (29 years old, Chongming native), discovered them, lay in ambush in the dark, and captured the thief Zhang Zhikang. The rest escaped.

<h3>Completion of Tintang Township Road in the County</h3>
<p>Proclamation to the Public to Protect It Carefully</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a proclamation stating that the 5th District Tintang Township Road has been completed, and all are to protect it carefully and repair it from time to time to facilitate transportation. According to the report from Xing Zhigang, the district chief of the 5th District, "The district previously received orders from the government to requisition labor to build the Tintang Township Road (from Tiqiao via Chenxing to Tangkou). The able-bodied men trained at the second phase of Sanmin School were included in the requisition labor roster and reported in writing. The labor service was held on January 17, following the predetermined road width of 2.5 meters by the surveyor and the depth and width of the ditches on both sides of 0.5 meters each. The construction has been completed. It should be reported in writing, requesting the county chief to send personnel for acceptance to emphasize the order. Furthermore, since the township road has just been completed, I am deeply afraid that unscrupulous people will arbitrarily damage the roadbed, leading to the failure of previous efforts. A proclamation should be issued to the public to protect it carefully, and the owners of the fields and tenants on both sides of the road must repair it at any time to make it long-lasting and facilitate transportation. This is for the public convenience." Based on this, in addition to sending personnel for acceptance and reporting the case, a proclamation is issued, asking the people along the road to protect it carefully and repair it at any time to facilitate transportation.

Yesterday afternoon at about 3 pm, Zhang Zhichu, the manager of Rencheng Rice Shop at No. 390 Gonghe New Road, Yongyu Road Intersection, reported that at about 12:20 pm on the 10th of this month, Huang Baolin, the shop's accountant, hired a rickshaw to deliver funds to various rice shops on Xinzha Bridge and Guangfu Road, carrying three packages of legal tender, one package of 580 yuan to Juyu Cheng Rice Shop, one package of 205 yuan to Yongshun Tai Rice Shop, and one package of 531 yuan to Tong Shen Rice Shop, all wrapped in newspapers and hidden in his pocket. Unexpectedly, when the car arrived at Gonghe New Road, Jiaotong Road (ie, the railway crossing), just as the train was passing and the gate was closed, two robbers with Jiangbei accents wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers suddenly stopped the rickshaw, showed a pistol, and forbade him to speak out. They robbed all three packages of legal tender hidden in his pocket, totaling 1,316 yuan, as well as 17 dimes and 60 copper coins. When the robbery occurred, although pedestrians at the railway crossing saw it, no one dared to ask, and they only watched the robbers flee eastward along Jiaotong Road. After the incident, the shop reported it to the Zhongyu Road Police Station under its jurisdiction, which forwarded it to the Xinzha Police Branch to pursue the robbers, but the case has not yet been solved.</p>

Custom-made pills and tablets are available, and a telephone ordering service is provided for prescription delivery, all with utmost speed.

All customers, regardless of the amount of purchase, will receive a complimentary gift.</p>
<p>"Baby Face" Becomes Popular Gift Among Ladies: The "Baby Face" product sold by Sino-French Pharmacy is of delicate quality and has a refined fragrance. Not only does it moisturize and beautify the skin, but it can also remove blemishes and moles. Regular application will ensure a youthful appearance. The name "Baby Face" is truly well-deserved. In recent days, due to the Lunar New Year, fashionable ladies and virtuous women have been eagerly purchasing it as a gift, resulting in a surge in sales.</p>
<p>Gospel for the Weak-Minded: The brain is the center of the entire nervous system and the hub of thought. If the brain is weak, success in endeavors will be difficult to achieve. As the New Year begins and plans are made, how should one nourish their brain? "Wald's Brain Tonic," produced by the general manager of Taihe Western Medicine Company at 565 Sichuan Road in this city, is made with a variety of effective brain-strengthening and blood-nourishing medicines. It is definitely not comparable to other so-called brain tonics made with stimulants and anesthetics. Therefore, long-term use will not have any drawbacks. It is truly a gospel for the weak-minded.</p>
<p>The Bestselling Norwegian Cod Liver Oil: Norway produces codfish, which is not only abundant but also exceptionally fresh and delicious, and has long been renowned throughout the world. Therefore, the Norwegian government strictly manages the production of cod liver oil, using scientific methods to extract oil from fresh fish livers, ensuring that the original vitamins are not lost. Recently, people in our country have become increasingly aware of the health benefits of cod liver oil, and more and more people are purchasing it. Therefore, in addition to selling various foreign-imported cod liver oils, major pharmacies are also purchasing clear cod liver oil from Norway and producing their own malt extract and milky white versions in Shanghai, as well as bottling and selling clear cod liver oil. According to statistics, the value of cod liver oil imported from Norway in 1936 was over 85,000 yuan in national currency, but in 1937, it suddenly increased to over 210,000 yuan. The rapid increase in sales is evident.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Sir, I am writing on behalf of my client, Gu Shaoqin, who was shocked to read the news item "Woman Dies from Abortion, Husband Sues for Damages" in the Shen Bao on the 16th of this month. I have learned that my client is studying nursing at Dasheng Hospital, and unfortunately, like Dr. Yan, has been implicated in the case. Whether she is guilty or innocent should be determined by the law, and I do not wish to argue about it. However, the newspaper stated that the defendant's side had already hired someone to negotiate with the victim's family to compensate for the losses, in order to mitigate criminal responsibility. This is absolutely untrue. I suspect that someone deliberately stirred up public opinion in order to slander the newspaper and the news is inaccurate. I ask you, the respected newspaper, to investigate and correct the situation. Respectfully submitted to the Shen Bao, Lawyer Sun Zuji, Du Xi, February 16th.</p>

<h3>Du Yuesheng and Others' Letter to the Creditors of Tongyi</h3>
<p>Dear Sirs, Half a year has passed since the closure of Tongyi Trust Company. During this time, there have been bankruptcy rulings, litigation disputes, the hasty efforts of debt collection groups, and repeated fruitless meetings of creditors, causing much turmoil and exhaustion among those involved, with no tangible results. Apart from the return of one-quarter of the savings department debts, nothing else has been heard. We have served in Shanghai for many years and have many relatives and friends involved in the Tongyi debt situation. Moreover, the total amount of debt is as high as more than 4 million yuan, which has a considerable impact on Shanghai's financial situation. Out of public duty and private sentiment, we cannot stand idly by. Therefore, with the consultation of creditors and their representatives, we advocated for speedy mediation and resumption of business as soon as possible, so that debts could be repaid sooner and creditors could benefit more. We have proposed a plan and personally guarantee it. At that time, we consulted widely, considered the pros and cons, and put in a lot of effort. Now, we will briefly state the advantages and disadvantages for discussion.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the amount of debt recovery should be maximized, and the speed of recovery should be expedited. More is better, less is harmful; speed is beneficial, delay is harmful. This is an unchanging principle. From the beginning, we have advocated for speedy mediation and resumption of business as soon as possible, because we believe that only in this way can the amount be maximized and the recovery be expedited. It is easy to understand that this principle does not require further explanation. First, let's talk about the speed of recovery. According to the mediation plan, the repayment method, and Article 5 of the plan, the repayment period will be calculated from the date of the mediation agreement, which is approximately six to nine months, and no later than one year. According to the bankruptcy procedure, the repayment period will be at least three to four years later. Because in the bankruptcy procedure, the disposal of assets must first be converted into cash. Converting to cash requires an auction, which requires an announcement, which requires an assessment of the price, which requires the consent of the supervisor. The procedures are very complicated. After the auction, if there is no buyer, the price must be reduced and the announcement must be re-issued for another auction. The procedures are very complicated again. This is done once or twice, and so on countless times. This is the case for one asset, and so on for all assets. The time required for this is undoubtedly far away. As for the recovery of accounts, the procedures are as complicated as the disposal of assets. After some twists and turns, a lawsuit is filed, and after some litigation, a judgment is made and executed. The execution may be challenged, and the objection must be litigated again. Fortunately, the execution must go through some twists and turns before the auction. If the execution is unsuccessful, it must be pursued for some time. This is the case for household A, and perhaps also for household B. The time required for this is undoubtedly far away. How long is life? The changes in the world are infinite. Judging from previous examples, it is often a waste of time with no results. Even if it proceeds smoothly and ends safely, the creditor will be in an extremely disadvantageous position. Compared with the mediation plan and repayment method, which is no more than one year, the advantages and disadvantages cannot be compared on the same day. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Third Day of Sino-British Billiards Match: Ding Mingyi vs. Booker</h3>

Ding has superb skills, while Booker is also one of the top players among the British expatriates. The determination of around 600 points will surely be a tense competition.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chestham of the British fourth group showed his strong combat strength as the best player among the five players in the British team. The team had this strategy of five changes in front and back positions to balance the overall situation. Before the game yesterday, Wu Chengqi's defeat was expected, but it was hoped that the losses would not be too great, affecting future victories. Sure enough, Wu did his best to keep up, and within 600 points, he even exceeded it several times. In the end, he lost by only 131 points. The cumulative score for the two days is a loss of 45 points, which has little impact on the championship prospects. Chestham had 14 shots that exceeded 20 points, while Wu had only 5. However, the largest shot of 50 points that day was made by Wu. Chestham took the lead at first, but Wu gradually rose with his non-empty shots, initially exceeding 300 points. Chestham suddenly used smooth techniques, hitting four large scores in a row: 38, 36, 38, 25, etc., leading by 163 points (566 to 403). Fortunately, he did not relax afterwards and continued to fight seriously, winning back more than 30 points. The result was 600 to 469 points. The highest records of the two are as follows:</p>
<p>Chestham: 21, 46, 21, 29, 25, 24, 21, 23, 30, 28, 38, 36, 38, 25.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chinese United Team Defeats Hankou Again in the Leader Cup Inter-City Replay</h3>
<p>Hankou Scores First, Resulting in 2-1</p>
<p>The Leader Cup Hong Kong-Hankou-Shanghai Simple Football Inter-City Match has attracted the attention of many fans since the first round was held on the 14th. Therefore, yesterday's replay between Hankou and the Shanghai Chinese United team was even more crowded. As a result of the battle, the Shanghai team won 2-1. At the sound of the bell, the Hankou team took the field first, and the Shanghai Chinese United team arrived late. After tossing a coin to determine the formation, the fierce battle began. On the Shanghai side, Mai Jiliang was stationed in the center, with strict medical skills. On the Hankou side, Deng Zhiyang was moving East and West, with no gap to be found. The two teams were evenly matched for more than ten minutes. Before long, Hankou's Zheng Zhiyun got the ball and passed it remotely to Wu Qixiang. Wu did not sit on the landing ball and swept it with force, slightly off target. Then, Huang Hongrong on the left and Luo Cheng on the right were on the attack, and Deng Zhiyang responded on the right corner. With a bang, the record was opened first. The Shanghai generals refused to show weakness, running and jumping as fast as gods. The Hankou position was suddenly tight. Shu Shigeng received assistance from Cao Qinfang and shot quickly, hitting the net. The first half ended with a 1-1 draw. In the second half, the Shanghai formation was slightly changed. Jin Jiabiao was replaced by Lu Zhiming. Jin was well-defended, and the Hankou three forwards could not attack. They changed to attacking from the left. Huang Guorong was agile and lively, feinting attacks. The burly man Li Yichen could not stop him either. Several shots were dangerously close, but fortunately Lu Chengkang was agile and defused the danger one by one. Seeing the situation was not good, Jia Liliang of the Shanghai team worked hard to counterattack. Sure enough, the situation turned better. There were many dangerous situations in front of the Hankou team. Cao Qinfang got the ball and swept it sideways, and the ball went into the net from the corner of the goal. At this time, the Hankou team was determined to recover the lost ground, but unfortunately time was against them, and they suffered a miserable defeat with a score of 1-2. In this battle, the main player of the Hankou team, Zheng Zhiyun, suffered a serious leg injury due to careless ball saving. Therefore, although the Hankou team has already left Shanghai, Zheng is still waiting for treatment, and the National Small Football Association has sent a letter to the Wuchang Provincial Capital Police Department to ask for leave. The lineup is recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Elementary Schools Should Pay Attention to Implementing Health Education</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau Issues an Order to Comply With</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau instructs public and private elementary schools: Health education is crucial to the physical and mental development of children. Improper implementation can affect children's physique, which is not a minor issue. Implementation methods should be carefully studied to ensure they are physiologically appropriate and coupled with corresponding measures to gradually achieve perfection. Ten special precautions for implementing health education are hereby formulated and urgently distributed for all schools to comply with. The attached precautions are as follows: 1. Except for natural deep breathing during exercise, students should not be required to perform deep breathing exercises. 2. Instruct students to drink boiled water when they are thirsty and do not require them to drink a certain number of cups per day. 3. When students are sweeping, they should be equipped with long-handled brooms and wear mouth covers. 4. In classrooms with insufficient light, the seating arrangements of students should be swapped every week according to height, with brighter and darker seats being exchanged. 5. Students should not be punished to stand for more than 10 minutes. 6. There should be a lively and happy atmosphere between teachers and students in the classroom. 7. Teachers should not sit or stand in front of windows during teaching, exposing students directly to the light. 8. When students are working at their desks, they should bend their arms and keep their backs straight. 9. Students are prohibited from working under direct sunlight. 10. Students are prohibited from putting pencils in their mouths.</p>
<h3>The Ministry Orders a Reduction in Book Prices</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 16th) The Ministry of Education believes that the prices of textbooks and books published by various bookstores are not reasonable. It has instructed the Shanghai Education Bureau to transfer the order to the Shanghai Book Industry Association to formulate a unified sales method for textbooks and books, which has been submitted to the Ministry for modification and issuance for compliance. Subsequently, various bookstores submitted the reduction of prices of primary and secondary school textbooks to the Ministry for record. The Ministry approved the trial implementation for six months, after which all prices should be revised again. The principle is that the price of secondary school textbooks should be reduced to 90% of the original price, and the price of primary school textbooks should be reduced to 50% of the original price. The prices of ordinary books should also be reduced appropriately. Now, the Ministry of Education believes that the New Year period is coming to an end, and various bookstores should immediately revise and reduce prices again. In addition, some bookstores have not fully implemented the price reduction of ordinary books and have instead set the original price as the actual price, which is not appropriate. On the 16th, it was specifically ordered that the Social Bureaus of Shanghai and Beijing should transfer the order to various bookstores to quickly reduce prices and submit a comparative table for review and approval.</p>

<h3>A Word on Supporting National Products During the Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Customs occupy a significant place in Chinese society, and as we celebrate the Lunar New Year, we deeply feel their deeply rooted nature. Any force would find it difficult to change them in a short time. As we observe the path of national products during this Lunar New Year, it is worth discussing.</p>
<p>First, Daily Necessities　When people celebrate the New Year, they inevitably buy some daily necessities. According to the report of the China National Products Company, daily necessities account for one-third of the daily turnover of 17,000 to 18,000 yuan at the end of the year, which shows the prosperity of the sales of daily necessities. According to the report of female interviewers, many housewives go to national product companies or national product factories to purchase daily necessities for their families recently. However, they still have some opinions, saying that although the quality of national products is not bad, the price is still a bit expensive, and the politeness of the shop assistants needs to be more courteous. Therefore, the reduction of costs of various factories and the training of company shop assistants are important issues in the future.</p>
<p>Second, Toys　During the Lunar New Year, nothing can affect children's education more than elders giving children New Year's money. For the sake of money, children do not hesitate to lower their ambitions and greet elders, which is the most corrupting habit of children's morality. We believe that it should be eliminated. One day, many educators gathered and advocated using toys to replace New Year's money, which was agreed by most people. It happened that Mr. Xiang Kangyuan was present, and everyone said, please Mr. Xiang to make more children's toys to meet the needs of this Lunar New Year. Mr. Xiang said that Kangyuan Factory is willing to use a large number of toys at low prices to meet these many wise elders. It is said that the sales of toys in the national product company this year are much better than in previous years. It is a pity that our propaganda of using toys to replace New Year's money has not been popularized. We hope to promote it greatly next year to correct this popular habit of worshiping money. At the same time, we also hope that Mr. Xiang will do his best to manufacture more varieties and reduce costs to benefit countless children in society.</p>
<p>Third, Food and Beverages　During the New Year, food also accounts for the majority of consumption. Just cakes and candies alone are considerable. It is said that Guanshengyuan's business during the Lunar New Year exceeds the usual monthly turnover by more than one week. In addition, the sales of various foods and beverages, such as dried goods, are many times higher than usual. These goods can be said to be domestic products now. This is very gratifying to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Fourth, Clothing　Everyone likes to wear new clothes, new hats, and new shoes during the New Year, especially many children, so the sales of clothing also account for an important part. On New Year's Eve, I went to the national product company to buy jackets for children and hats and shoes for myself. The company has everything, especially the cheap and good quality of Huafu hats and the bright and clean color of Hongxin cloth, which can be said to be very satisfactory. Finally, I went to Sanyou Industrial Co., Ltd. and bought many children's supplies and local products, and felt that the shop assistants' full service spirit can be seen in the usual training. It is said that Sanyou's mail order department is completely dedicated to service. Customers in various places, no matter what goods they want to buy, the company can handle them according to their needs, making them satisfied. When I went to the third floor, I saw a shop assistant writing for customers. It is said that friends from Sichuan sent letters to entrust them to write. In short, if national product stores can take service as the starting point for business, the future is sure to be promising.</p>
<h3>New Year and National Products</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Time flies, and the Year of the Ox has arrived, succeeding the Year of the Rat. This New Year of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937] has also followed the passage of time and arrived. As we stand on the position of promoting and using national products at this time of the New Year, we have infinite enthusiasm and hope for the future of the national product movement. I would like to express my humble opinion to share with fellow compatriots.</p>
<p>The New Year has arrived! My dear fellow countrymen and women, in this warm and sunny New Year, you will inevitably replace the old with the new for all your daily necessities, either buying all new items or purchasing them in moderation. This is almost inevitable. However, I sincerely hope that all compatriots will purchase as many national products as possible when purchasing supplies, and at the same time, sincerely persuade relatives and friends to jointly purchase from places that truly promote national products. If we can do this, the New Year's national product movement will definitely achieve a good situation due to the efforts of all compatriots. The difficulties of the national economy will also be reduced invisibly due to the development of the national product industry.</p>
<p>Some may say: "It is not that I do not accept national products, nor is it that I do not want to use national products, but today's national products have not yet reached the point of perfection that satisfies people." Alas! This statement is wrong. After more than ten years of efforts to promote Chinese national products, the exquisiteness of their products has improved significantly compared to the past. What is especially gratifying is that since the National Product Year of the 22nd year of the Republic [i.e., 1933], the efforts of the national product production community have been exceptionally admirable to us. Strictly speaking, their products have indeed gradually reached the status of "first-class national products," such as the cotton fabrics of Sanyou Industrial Co., Ltd., the medicines of Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Factory, the enamel products of China Enamel Factory, the underwear of Wuhe Weaving Factory, the cosmetics of Family Industrial Cooperative, the tonics of Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, the various silks and satins of Meiya Silk Factory, and the toys and boxes of Kangyuan Factory. If we compare these national products with foreign goods, we dare to say that there is little difference between them.</p>
<p>Therefore, at this time when the beautiful New Year is approaching, I especially recommend various first-class national products to all compatriots. I hope that my compatriots will not purchase supplies unless they must, otherwise, I hope that they will only purchase and handle national products. If everyone can be consistent in this way, what about the development of the national product industry in this New Year?</p>
<h3>New Inventions by Chinese</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Yonghui, a Chinese paper-making engineer who studied in Germany, recently invented a method of making paper from sorghum stalks at the Paper-Making Research Institute of the Dresden University of Technology, and the results are excellent. According to our country, paper has always been made from bamboo, rice straw, mulberry bark, rags, reeds, old paper, and bark as raw materials. However, bamboo, rice straw, and mulberry bark are only produced in the three provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi, and other provinces in the country produce very little. Therefore, there is a lack of raw materials, so the paper industry has not been able to develop. Now, if sorghum stalks are used instead, the output of sorghum stalks in the provinces of North China is very rich, and we will not have to worry about the lack of raw materials for making our own paper. This invention is the first wonderful flower in our national product industry this year.</p>
<h3>Some Ideas on Visiting</h3>
<p>— Zhou Bangjun</p>
<p>National Product Visiting Seminar</p>
<p>Visiting is not an ordinary job. Every interviewer must have the following conditions:</p>
<p>First, Sufficient Knowledge is Required</p>
<p>Second, Considerable Experience is Required</p>
<p>Third, A Generous Attitude is Required</p>
<p>Fourth, Fluent Eloquence is Required</p>
<p>Therefore, interviewers are by no means ordinary talents who can undertake this important task. Especially in today's market, which is full of imported goods, and when people generally worship foreign goods, national product interviewers are not something that ordinary people can rashly undertake.</p>
<p>The scope of national product visits seems to be too broad, because every interviewer must have some considerable understanding of the factories entrusted to them; however, the organization and products of each factory are different, unless every product has been tested and there is some understanding of it, the wording during the visit will not be empty and abstract, and the belief of the interviewee will be firm. If you pick up the teeth of others, even if you can forcibly quibble and say a lot of nonsense, it is inevitable to arouse suspicion, and the entire visit will fail. To make up for this shortcoming, Bangjun thought of the need for a seminar, on the one hand, to invite the factory authorities to impart some necessary knowledge, and on the other hand, to solve the various difficulties that arise during the visit.</p>
<p>Since the importance of the seminar is as described above, then today we must talk about what needs to be said at the seminar:</p>
<p>First, Pay Attention to the Psychology of the Target　In other words, those who are responsible for visiting should be like nannies and elementary school teachers. They should abandon their own prejudices and cater to the other party's will, and then use a roundabout method to change the other party's psychology; if they do not abandon their own opinions and do not ask about other people's preferences, the result will only be annoying, so if the other party is a worshiper of foreign goods, then we should talk about national products from foreign goods: if they are enthusiastic promoters of national products, then we should tell them the method of identification, so that the other party can sincerely accept the visit.</p>
<p>Second, Avoid False Propaganda　Few national products can gain a foothold, and the crux of the matter is that the propaganda cannot be honest. The interviewer, of course, also has the task of propaganda, and should pay attention to this point. To avoid false propaganda, we must first conduct an investigation of the goods entrusted by the factory. We should have a deep understanding of the quality, efficacy, and decoration, so that we will not be dumbfounded when we visit. Or we will fall into false propaganda and destroy the achievements of the past work.</p>
<p>Third, Pay Attention to the Other Party's Environment　The person being visited may not necessarily have the purchasing power, or it may not be needed by everyone, and it is certain to make the other party accept the interviewer's opinion. This is going against the grain, and it will only cause unpleasant feelings. Therefore, when the interviewer arrives at the interviewee's home, they should first pay attention to the surrounding layout and determine the other party's environment. Then plan the outline of the visit, so that you can open up and reason. If you are a staunch pragmatist, it is difficult to visit cosmetic fragrances, which is not only ineffective, but also embarrassing. This is to lose the meaning of the visit.</p>
<p>Fourth, Cater to the Season and Needs　Visiting winter items in summer is untimely. The interviewer certainly understands these common sense, but the entrusting factory may have another reason why it must be included in the visit, then we can only adapt to the situation. As for the family being visited, if they are using a certain product, this central theme must not be abandoned, because just this one material can be used to develop one's own writing. Perhaps, by inferring from one example, we can incidentally promote other products; this is beneficial to all factories.</p>
<p>Fifth, Do Not Be Afraid to Seek Knowledge and Do Not Avoid Being Seen as Strange　The interviewer is not necessarily all-knowing and omnipotent. They should use their spare time to go to the entrusting factory to investigate the content of the products, and ask questions if they do not understand. They should make at least one visit to the person in charge of the factory every week to increase their knowledge. At the same time, they should often tell the factory authorities the criticisms of the interviewees, and report the common nature and value to the meeting for the factories to adopt and correct.</p>
<p>In short, the responsibility of the interviewer is very important, and the knowledge that the interviewer should have is very large, which cannot be fully covered by these few words. Fortunately, there are many opportunities for narration, and we may as well put forward more opinions to talk about.</p>
<h3>National Products and New Year Carnival</h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>The gifts from various national product factories that we saw at the New Year Carnival hosted by the seven groups can be said to be the first-class national products. They are perfect and I can criticize them.</p>
<p>After many housewives received the gifts, they all said that these national products meet the standard national products in our ideal, and they are called first-class national products. Who would say it is not appropriate?</p>
<p>After many children received national product gifts, especially the toys made by Xiangyuan Can Factory were praised. Educational, national defense, scientific, and aesthetic, these innocent and lively children were overjoyed after receiving them, and they were ten times happier than receiving New Year's money. Some people say: In the future, it is better for elders to give toys to children than New Year's money, which is more meaningful and valuable.</p>
<h3>From "An Eye for an Eye" to National Product Toothpaste</h3>
<p>— Diligence</p>
<p>The meaning of the phrase "an eye for an eye" is to want people to have the spirit of resistance and not to be timid or retreat.</p>
<p>The enemy uses economic aggression to plot against us, dumping a large number of goods. If we do not actively find ways to deal with it and do not develop our national products quickly, and just let the enemy's teeth bite, it will become our fatal wound, and our country's lifeline will also be bitten off by it! Therefore, we must defend our country, and we must sharpen our teeth, because teeth are really the most important thing for ourselves.</p>
<p>The condition for healthy teeth is brushing your teeth, and the toothpaste for brushing your teeth must be a national product. These words can be compared. The superior national toothpaste, "131 Toothpaste" from Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Factory, is prescribed by dental experts and supervised by pharmacists. It has the medicinal effects of cleaning teeth, neutralizing acid, sterilizing and antiseptic, and protecting tooth enamel, etc., which is enough for use.</p>

<h3>Reply to Mr. Chen Zhaoyi of Anhui Shucheng Minsheng Factory</h3>
<p>The artificial pedal spinning wheel is widely used in the counties and villages of the former Songjiang Prefecture in Jiangsu Province, and Pudong is an example. The main components of its structure are: a large wheel disk, three yarn sprockets, and a pedal rod. The spinner sits and steps on the pedal rod with two feet, then the large wheel rotates, so the belt connected to the wheel and the sprockets also moves, and the yarn sprockets move accordingly. The cotton strip is drawn on the sprocket, thinned into yarn, and the yarn is wrapped around the sprocket by stopping or retreating the large wheel pedal rod. Its efficiency is indeed not weak. However, the method of use cannot be learned without practical learning, and it is really difficult to explain in words. The car is made purely of hardwood, and the price does not exceed five yuan. It can weigh 30 kilograms, and it can be 3 feet high and 5 feet long. It cannot be mailed. As for the freight to your place, it is difficult to estimate because the traffic situation is unclear.

<h3>The Special Responsibility of Clothing Makers</h3>
<p>— Jia Ding</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng Tianfang is a famous thinker in our country. In his article "A Draft Proposal for Reforming Chinese School Education," he strongly advocated that "vocational schools should not be divided into agricultural, industrial, and commercial departments, but should be divided into many different classes. What kind of people are needed in society, we should open that kind of class, and what is not needed in society, we should not make." For example, isn't clothing maker available in every city? Why doesn't the vocational school open a clothing class to adapt to the needs of society? "After graduation, the school will issue a license," and he can open his own clothing store or go to people's homes to do tailoring. His conclusion is well said: "The clothing makers trained in this way must be much better than the many uneducated clothing makers now. Not only can they make clothes, but they can also be called upon to take the responsibility of promoting national products. (Because the styles and qualities of many women's clothes are intentionally or unintentionally influenced by clothing makers.)"</p>
<p>I deeply believe that clothing is one of the important needs of life, and it is ranked alongside food, shelter, and transportation; and women need clothes more than men, and they have the power to advise men on their clothes. Clothing makers are specialized manufacturers of clothing. Although they are not able to be the masters of an employer in a blatant manner, they are inevitably the most active drivers of employers' consciousness in an invisible way; usually, when women make clothes, they always like to ask clothing makers for their opinions on the styles and materials of the clothes, not to mention men; at this time, clothing makers, in addition to doing their own professional skills planning, is a good opportunity to dedicate themselves to the magnificent national product promotion movement, and it is also a moment to fulfill the responsibility of a citizen to love the country. People who are currently serving as tailors, please think about it carefully!</p>
<p>If life permits, I think the best and most skilled clothing maker would never be willing to tailor clothes for employers without national fabric. Even if we step back and speak with some conscience, clothing makers, in this period of serious national crisis, must also do their best to sincerely persuade employers to buy as much national fabric as possible.</p>

<h3>Mistake</h3>
<p>— (Wei Ji)</p>
<p>Mistakes are inevitable for everyone. But as long as you correct your mistakes, it is like not making mistakes. So-called, avoiding mistakes is equal to having no mistakes!</p>
<p>Rather than advocating "do a good deed every day," why not advocate "correct a mistake every day"!</p>
<p>Every time you discover a mistake in yourself, it is a stimulus to yourself, and it is also an opportunity to strive for self-renewal!</p>
<p>The more times you discover mistakes, the more life experience you accumulate!</p>
<p>People who are not afraid to correct their mistakes are people with the strongest hope.</p>
<p>Mistakes are the ladder to help people improve!</p>
<p>People who are willing to make up their minds to correct their mistakes are better than those who have or do not have mistakes!</p>
<p>Someone who can always point out and correct my mistakes is my good friend!</p>
<p>If you can repent immediately after making a mistake, you are still a gentleman who "knows a mistake and is sure to improve."</p>
<p>Having a mistake is one mistake; not admitting a mistake is another mistake. If you admit it, both mistakes will be gone, and if you don't admit it, both mistakes will be inevitable. What is the point of those who argue to cover up their mistakes?</p>
<h3>Diplomacy that Fully Extends Righteousness</h3>
<p>— The Truth</p>
<p>For the past sixty years, Japan's diplomacy towards China could be summed up with the phrases "eager for public interest" and "fond of boasting and deceit." (See Chen Zhenxian's preface to the first volume of "China and Japan in the Past Sixty Years," written in 1932.) As for the diplomacy of the Li Hongzhang style, opinions vary among the benevolent and the wise. After reviewing the entirety of the million-plus-word book, it is difficult to make a concise conclusion.</p>
<p>Recently, I happened to read "Maritime Anecdotes in Verse" by Ye Chucang, written in 1920, which recounts the words of Grand Secretary Li from the mouth of Sai Jinhua. It was as if the clouds had parted, surpassing the reading of the entire history of Sino-Japanese diplomacy of that time.</p>
<p>Ye's poem says: "How can a banquet compare to the intimacy of the bedchamber? (Rhyming with 'piao,' Ye's note) A spring night's gentle conversation surpasses grand schemes. Winning a single word from you creates a new precedent; Li Hongzhang, knowing my heart in the underworld." Ye added annotations to his original poem, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>"Sai Jinhua, the wife of a champion scholar, wandered for twenty years and returned to Shanghai. Her friend, Mr. Ma, was also a wild student in Shanghai twenty years ago. After the disaster, they embraced, as happy as in their youth. He once discussed world affairs with her, and she sighed, saying, 'Grand Secretary Li Hongzhang once said, "Grant whatever is permissible to outsiders quickly, to show my sincerity; reject whatever is impermissible immediately, to uphold my righteousness; there is nothing that cannot be done." Now, those who sit at the altar and preside over banquets are unwilling to grant and unable to reject. This is why the country is defeated!' Alas! The talent of a negotiator is despised and placed on par with a prostitute. How sad!"</p>
<p>Last year, Sai Jinhua passed away. My friend talked about Ye Chucang's "The Legend of Yiluan Palace," written in 1917, which seems like it could be completed and continued today.</p>
<h3>The Beauty of Black People</h3>
<p>— Li Ping</p>
<p>In the eyes of Black people, the first condition for beauty is skin that is dark, and it must be so dark that it shines to be considered beautiful. That's why Black women apply coconut oil all over their bodies. The second condition is that the eyes should be as small as possible, the lips should be thick, and the nose should be as flat as a pancake. These are all conditions of beauty.</p>
<p>Black people also pay a lot of attention to hair, and you can tell from their hair whether they are married or unmarried. Married women often shave their heads into a bowl-shaped circle and glue the hair into a pointed shape with tree sap. Unmarried women braid their hair into several braids and glue them into a pen shape. They consider this to be beautiful.</p>
<p>Black people not only do not consider scars on a woman's face to be ugly, but they also believe that they are an indispensable part of beauty techniques. They deliberately tattoo flowers and create scars on the face, and they also color them in various colors, but red is the most popular.</p>
<p>Black people have never paid much attention to clothing. Usually, they only have a small loincloth. But one strange thing is that Black women often wrap a cloth band around their necks, supposedly to increase the length of their heads, which has great magical power.</p>
<h3>Cockfighting</h3>
<p>— Hui Bo</p>
<p>My hometown, Henan, has a tradition of cockfighting. It is most popular from the twelfth lunar month, when farmers are idle, until January of the following year. During this time, children hold roosters that are supposed to be sacrificed to the Stove God and look for opponents.</p>
<p>There are no conditions for cockfighting. As long as the opponents meet, they release their roosters to fight each other. Although the roosters are majestic, they are not comparable to humans. Therefore, although they have a haughty and self-important appearance, they never shout "Traitor, take my blade!" or "Submit to me and live, resist me and die!" They simply glare at each other, spread their wings, and extend their iron beaks and sharp spurs, fighting back and forth. The winner crows triumphantly (over the flock of hens), proudly dominating the area, while the loser flees with its head down.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for their fighting: to possess all the hens in the area, to show off their power, or perhaps for other reasons.</p>
<p>The people who watch cockfighting do so for entertainment. They enjoy seeing feathers plucked from each other's mouths and drops of blood falling on the ground and on the feathers. Even a snow-white rooster can be stained pink, completely changing its appearance due to the fighting. However, it is only praised and petted by children who love to watch the excitement. What people really like are beautiful, majestic roosters that crow diligently (that is, crow at dawn) and do not run around in the wild. They carefully protect them, preventing vicious roosters from harming them.</p>
<p>So I think: It would be best if roosters also had a school to teach them some knowledge so that they could understand their mission. However, this would definitely be opposed by children who love to watch the excitement.</p>
<h3>Cow Talk</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>This year is the Year of the Ox, so let's talk about oxen.</p>
<p>Among the twelve zodiac animals, the most useful, the most hard-working, the most abused by humans, and at the same time, the most striving for survival are the ox and the horse. The contribution of the ox seems even greater than that of the horse. Although horses held an important position in national defense in ancient times, their importance has diminished due to the progress of modern tactics. Although agriculture is also trending towards mechanization, the labor of oxen is still indispensable in China's agricultural sector. As for the other ten zodiac animals, they are not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The ox's contribution to humans is not only that its labor can be used for plowing fields, but also that milk, beef, butter, and bone marrow are all excellent nutrients for humans. Furthermore, hide and bones are excellent materials for industrial products. Oxen's labor can help human production, their milk and meat can provide human nutrition, and their hides and bones can be used for industrial manufacturing. The ox's contribution to humanity is so great, but its consumption is lower than that of ordinary animals. It eats dried grass, bean cakes, and free-growing wild grass. It lives in sheds behind houses, suffering from cold in winter and heat in summer. However, humans have absolutely no sympathy for it, driving it and whipping it. When it is old and sick, it is still slaughtered and its carcass is butchered, its hide and bones removed for profit. However, the ox knows to strive for survival. Every ox seems to know innately that only through effort can it survive in this world. So its heavy body always strives forward, and even when it is panting, it still uses its last breath to take its last step.</p>
<p>From the ox's lifestyle, I feel that China, in some ways, is too much like an ox. Look, the inexhaustible and inexhaustible treasures are just like an ox's milk, meat, and leather, with nothing wasted, right? And the low labor costs in the country and the Chinese people's habit of being hardworking, in the eyes of foreigners, are simply as cheap and effective as using the strength of an ox. The fact that overseas Chinese are being squeezed out everywhere is a good proof of this. And although we Chinese are creating happiness for humanity everywhere in this world of the survival of the fittest, the reward we get is discrimination, exclusion, and even being slaughtered and trampled on. How sad is that? However, even though the reward we get is like this, we are still working hard, promoting the culture of this world, never afraid, never discouraged. How great is this spirit?</p>
<p>However, although China and the ox are so similar, the ox is, after all, an ox, and China is, after all, China. Although the ox is exploited and cut off by others, we Chinese are now awake, and exploitation and slaughter are no longer allowed. What we have is the ox's rich resources, the ox's hard work, and the ox's understanding of life, but we also have the knowledge that the ox does not have. We will combine all the strengths that the ox has and the strengths that the ox does not have to help complete the new China—this is what we should be vigilant about in this Year of the Ox.</p>
<p>We are ultimately not oxen, and we will not allow others to exploit or slaughter us!</p>
<h3>Mated Mandarin Ducks</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 11 (Murmurs of Compassion from the Curtain; Repenting and Sacrificing Filial Piety; Autumn Light Dimming, Green Eyebrows Stirred by the Scene)</p>
<p>Menglan snorted through her nose and laughed, "Second Sister-in-law, you can be called a female Su Qin." The Second Young Mistress said, "What do you mean by that? I don't understand. Don't try to impress me with antiques." Menglan said, "You can't not understand. It means that person who became the prime minister of the six states." The Second Young Mistress smiled and nodded a few times, saying, "Oh, oh, oh? I understand. Are you accusing me unfairly? I won't say. How did you see that I am a female Su Qin?" Menglan said, "First, send me a few pots of chrysanthemums to make me happy. Then come upstairs and chat with me slowly. By talking and talking, you can bring out what you want to say. Your coming here is not only your intention, but Mother also knows, so she specially brewed a pot of tea for the two of us to drink." The Second Young Mistress took a sip of tea and smiled, "Sister, you are too smart." Menglan laughed, "Did I guess it right with just one guess?" The Second Young Mistress wore a blue short silk jacket with narrow sleeves, and two gold bracelets were on her sleeves, which made her muscles look even more full. Her hand holding the teacup would occasionally lift to tidy her hair. Her round face and big eyes revealed a bit of loyalty. Seeing Menglan just staring at her, she smiled and said, "Sister, are you wronging a good person? I have always thought this way. You are always frowning, so I should find a way to relieve your boredom. Your eldest sister-in-law even thinks I am meddling. Why would I want to add to your troubles? You said that Mother and I agreed in advance, that's even more wrong. You are a clever ghost, you can't hide anything from you, would Mother reveal anything in front of you?" Menglan said, "But this tea is indeed from Mother's storage." The Second Young Mistress put down the teacup, clapped her hands, and the gold bracelets rang out. She laughed, "It is indeed the tea from Mother's room. She can generously send good tea for you and me to drink, that's genuine." Menglan took the teacup and sipped it slowly, drinking it all up. She still held the cup in her hand, looking at it upside down. The Second Young Mistress smiled, "Sister, think carefully, am I really a female Su Qin?" Menglan smiled, "I'm sorry if I said it wrong, don't take it to heart." The Second Young Mistress smiled, "I only feel sorry for you, why would I blame you." Menglan smiled, "I am also a young lady from an upper-middle-class family, why do you feel sorry for me?" The Second Young Mistress was caught off guard by this sentence and didn't know how to answer. Seeing the teapot still on the table, she picked up the pot and poured a cup first. Then, she took Menglan's teacup and poured another cup and handed it to her, smiling, "This tea tastes good, have another cup." (134)</p>

<h3>Tomorrow's America</h3>
<p>— Huang Yuzhen</p>
<p>The customs, habits, and all modern social organizations in the United States are like scientific formulas. When I first arrived in the United States, I felt stressed and amazed everywhere! But taking an ordinary city as an example, it is like Avenue Joffre on Christmas Eve in Shanghai, or Nanjing Road on Saturday. Pedestrians, cars, and all kinds of interactions are all incredibly rushed. The facilities in houses and institutions are also the same as what we see in foreign houses and companies in Shanghai. But Americans' progress and reform are exceptionally swift. Therefore, general prognosticators often predict that the future of the United States will either be a complete reversal of fortune or complete decay.</p>
<p>Once, I listened to a lecture by Dr. Mj-Bume, an American social psychologist. He deduced future progress from the current social psychology of the United States, and I found it very interesting. Now I will briefly introduce his arguments, according to what I can remember:</p>
<p>(1) Transportation and Transit: He said that future streets in the United States will definitely have two layers, and cars can pass on both the upper and lower layers. Because the land value in cities is expensive, the alleys in the streets will be like the current main roads, where trams can travel back and forth. Street signs will be set up to alert people to traffic conflicts; pedestrian rules will be set to protect pedestrians' lives. Underground walkways will be set up in areas with heavy traffic. The road will be divided into three layers: the first layer for trams, the second layer for light cars, doctor cars, etc.; and the third layer for pedestrians. All three layers can be freely raised and lowered. Therefore, people on the upper layer can go to the lower layer, and people on the lower layer have the same freedom. Future airplanes can walk on the road and fly freely. In the center of the city or on the rooftop, there will be places for airplanes to land. Every few miles, there will be the establishment of the airport station to benefit flying and can arbitrarily move forward to the street, as the current car is the same. People can take planes to travel around the world at will. The equipment inside this kind of aircraft is indeed the same as the equipment inside the ship: there are rooms, there are dining rooms, there are reading rooms, there are smoking places, there are radio stations. The use of aircraft in the industry will be more active in the future. In commerce, in the postal service, in the navigation aspect, the aircraft will be used greatly, running across the oceans, covering the world. The driving of the ship, the train, the car will use electricity. The speed increases, will count the ship, eight miles per minute; train seventeen miles per minute; car - miles per minute. The vehicles employed on the current street, such as cars, automatic vehicles, streetcars, machine pedal cars, etc., must all be driven by electricity.</p>
<p>(2) Construction and Equipment: The tile surface and walls will be made of copper. The floor and pillars will be built of thick glass. Door handles and utensils will be made of silver-nickel. The rooftops of residential houses will all be equipped with gardens. Small parks will be set up in the streets for pedestrians to enjoy at will. All shops and buildings will be equipped with ice pipes and hot pipes. This kind of gas supply company, either commercial or state-run, is like today's electric lights and water companies. The cold and warm climate can be absolutely harmonized. Washing clothes and washing dishes at home now takes a lot of labor and time, and in the future, electricity will be used instead. This kind of machine is like today's sweeper. All dirty clothes, dishes, etc. can be put in the electric stove and washed clean by mechanical power. The phone can be made to the people on the plane in the air, the people in the car when driving, or the people on the train.</p>
<p>(3) Schools and Families: Professors will be changed to lectures, using the method of broadcasting, so that many people can listen. People who want to study only need to install a radio, so they don't need to go to school. Therefore, future education will definitely become extremely popular. Families will become like hotels, with only comfortable boarding houses and all beautiful facilities. Cooking at home will definitely disappear. When eating, either go to a restaurant or buy food back, because all food can be cooked, made, and packaged by others, just like the bread we buy today. Marriage must be done by trial marriage procedures. Marriage is not limited to national boundaries and is not restricted by ethnicity, and the world will definitely be realized.</p>
<p>These arguments are what Dr. Berne predicts. I am afraid that in the near future, the social culture of the United States will really be realized in this way, because the progressive, curious, and reforming psychology of Americans is sharper than any race in the world!</p>

<p>Supplement to the Local News of Shen Bao</p>
<p>Talks</p>
<h3>Organizing a Volunteer Police Force</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw in the newspaper that the Songjiang County Government, in order to strengthen local self-defense forces, had a proposal to organize a volunteer police force. A meeting was convened earlier to prepare for it. The members are required to be graduates of junior high school or above and have a legitimate occupation or property. The county magistrate serves as the captain, and the police chief serves as the deputy captain. I don't know whether this system is implemented according to the province's regulations or is an innovation of the county, but I had this idea twenty or thirty years ago. The reason for initiating this method is very simple. The security of a place relies entirely on a few policemen and local troops, which is not reliable at all. The security of a place can only be achieved by the people of the place themselves.</p>
<p>To expand on this, not only is this the case for the local area, but also for the country. A country can only be maintained by all the people. Relying entirely on the country's troops is probably not enough. Therefore, the organization of a local volunteer police force can not only maintain the security of a local area, but also maintain the security of a country. Therefore, it is said, "If you want to be stable, you must do it yourself;" and "Self-reliance." If a country relies solely on other countries as a savior, then the country will perish. The tactics of alliance and division can only be effective for a certain period of time and cannot be regarded as a panacea. The principle of a country's strength or weakness is originally like this, and in the current environment, this idea should be developed and expanded. The way to establish a country is here, and so is the way to establish oneself and one's family.</p>
<p>Since the rise of Fascism, countries that advocate justice and peace have been in a position of the survival of the fittest, unable to extricate themselves. They have no choice but to unite to expand their military preparations and strengthen their military force to reverse the decline. In the current trend, non-armed forces are not enough to speak of peace, and only armed forces can hope for peace, which is very obvious. Therefore, it is said, "Kill to stop killing, and killing can be stopped." Mr. Einstein is a pacifist, but now he tells his friends that pacifism is useless. Now you can only support the war and help the war. The country is formed by the accumulation of people. If the people themselves stand on the Qinglongtou to watch the killing and are unwilling to serve on the battlefield, there is no way to do it. Therefore, to strengthen the country, the people must first strengthen themselves; to maintain the security of the local area, we must first maintain the security of the country; to maintain the security of the country, this system should be promoted throughout the country. If this system is implemented in a county, the county will benefit; if it is implemented in a province, the province will benefit; if it is implemented throughout the country, the country will benefit. Therefore, the volunteer police system should be implemented throughout the country, not just in a county or township.</p>
<h3>Night of the God of Wealth</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>On this day, the six of them filled their stomachs with food very early in the morning to prepare for a good sale.</p>
<p>The six of them were busy all day long. They borrowed ten yuan of usurious money from Zhao Mazi and borrowed a red robe and a set of gongs and drums from the Wufu Weiyang Grand Theater. This was thanks to Liu Dakuaizi's reputation, otherwise, where would they borrow from?</p>
<p>Liu Dakuaizi was tall and handsome, and they called him the God of Wealth. His face was covered with gold powder, leaving only two eyes and a mouth. He wore the red robe, put on a pair of boots, and held two gold ingots in his hands. In this way, he was already a God of Wealth.</p>
<p>Zhao Ada was good at saying auspicious words. He wore a long gown and held a square plate in his hand. On the plate were Zhao Mazi's ten yuan. They thought: If they did this, people would see whole banknotes, and they might know that they couldn't spend too much, so they would make a fortune. The others played the gongs and drums and followed behind.</p>
<p>A group of children followed them, joining in the fun.</p>
<p>Liu Dakuaizi ran like crazy to a decent-looking store, jumping around and performing a "show"? Then, Zhao Ada went up with a smile and said, "Sir, the God of Wealth has sent ingots. Congratulations, congratulations."</p>
<p>The "sir" was very stingy and only threw down a few coppers.</p>
<p>"Sir, raise it a little, the God of Wealth has come, it doesn't matter."</p>
<p>"Take it away, I've been asked like this six times, how can I spend it? The year is not good."</p>
<p>"Sir, raise it a little, it's only once a year."</p>
<p>Finally, he got six more coppers, and left very dissatisfied.</p>
<p>The second door had a notice from the lawyer for liquidation. What about the third one, they thought. But the third door had a pair of Spring Festival couplets pasted on it, which read, "Implement a new life, abolish old habits."</p>
<p>They thought, did they not even want the God of Wealth?</p>
<p>The night gradually faded away, and they went from house to house with a full of hope, trying to satisfy their desires.</p>
<h3>Father and Daughter</h3>
<p>— Na</p>
<p>The sunlight filtered through the damp mist, descending once more upon this vast village.</p>
<p>The entire street lay still like a hibernating beast, with about eleven or twelve small shops crowded on either side like claws. The doors of the shops, starting from the first one, were slowly pulled open, and the young shop assistants lazily poked their heads out, inquiring after each other. Suddenly, a piece of news spread from the greengrocer's shop, quickly picked up by the early morning customers, flowing like a storm throughout the village's thatched huts and coconut groves.</p>
<p>The first to bring this news was an old woman, who said with the interest of someone chewing candy:</p>
<p>"Open the door, sister-in-law!" I thought: Who could it be? Coming to knock on doors so early in the morning. So I stuck my head out of the window, but it was still dark, and I couldn't see who it was.</p>
<p>"Who are you, what's the matter?" I asked loudly.</p>
<p>"Our Deborah Resi hasn't come here, has she? She disappeared from my house in the middle of the night..." a familiar voice answered.</p>
<p>"No, she hasn't! No, she hasn't!" I knew who it was, I replied, thinking: This little girl won't leave her house except to run off with someone, you know how strict her father is! But I didn't say it, I was afraid of hurting the old man's feelings...</p>
<p>Everyone on the street remembered this unfortunate old man. By this time, he had searched the entire village, feeling sad and exhausted, and had gone home to cry.</p>
<p>Three years ago, he was a coachman. Somehow, he suddenly felt that the end of the world had arrived, and that all of humanity, regardless of poverty, would be burned by God's phosphorus fire. So, he sold his horse and carriage and drank it all away. When drunk, he would go out bareheaded, waving his arms and stamping his feet in the street, his mouth frothing, shouting loudly: "The Last Judgment is coming, brothers and sisters! The Last Judgment is coming..."</p>
<p>And so, in his hazy, drunken eyes, he would see how God's phosphorus fire was burning down the village's thatched huts and fields, and how humanity was suffering the Last Judgment. Because of this, he was often mocked by people, and mischievous youths would tie his hands behind his back and drag him to the water tap, pouring cold water over his head. The village chief also often punished him by putting him in jail.</p>
<p>"Everyone is hostile to me, they insult and beat me. Friends, truly, they will inflict every imaginable disaster upon me."</p>
<p>He would say this to all strangers, his aging eyes filled with sorrowful tears.</p>
<p>It was said that he had also had good days. He had three daughters. Although his wife had died early, they lived happily. Soon, his first daughter committed suicide because of love, and his second daughter ran away with a coconut merchant without a word. From then on, their lives were shrouded in a thick shadow.</p>
<p>He imposed an astonishingly strict surveillance on his third, grown-up daughter.</p>
<p>"She, a very unfortunate child, has been making a living with her own small hands since she was thirteen. But I don't want her to continue like this, following the path her sisters took. I want her to live a decent life..."</p>
<p>So, he forbade her from attending various gatherings and rejected the young men who courted her. But, when he was drunk, she would slip away from his side like a shadow and immediately rush into another thatched hut, where a pair of strong arms were waiting for her. Until he was dragged to the water tap for a cold shower, he would wipe the water from his head, shake like a rooster, and run all over the coconut grove, searching the thatched huts of acquaintances, and then put on a very angry face:</p>
<p>"I'm going to break your legs, you slut! Do you know you've committed a sin? God doesn't allow this..."</p>
<p>The daughter would shed tears, without saying a word.</p>
<p>"Promise me you won't do this again..."</p>
<p>She nodded slightly, finally agreeing. Then, he would make the sign of the cross to heaven, reciting a penitential psalm, and she would do the same. Only then would he sigh as if a heavy burden had been lifted: "Good! Now you are free!"</p>
<p>He did this for years, which passed like a day, but finally he failed, and she was led away from his side by strong arms.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, this unfortunate old man appeared on the street again, as before. He was drunk, bareheaded, barefoot, carrying a burlap sack, leaning on a gnarled wooden cane, walking hunched over, followed by a crowd of people shouting at him, throwing stones, and threatening him with their fists, but he acted as if nothing was happening, minding his own way.</p>
<p>"Hey, where are you going?" someone shouted at him.</p>
<p>"To another world, because it's lonely here..."</p>
<p>After saying that, he walked out of the village without looking back, the shadows of the palm trees swallowing him like a pair of black wings.</p>
<h3>Dispute</h3>
<p>— Ping Jun</p>
<p>After telling me the reason why he remained a bachelor, the stationed customs inspector Fu Changming, then shifted to other issues. He leaned close to my ear and said intimately, "Your station is just bad because there are no foreigners. It's different in our customs."</p>
<p>His manner of speaking was very uncouth, even though he was said to have received a secondary education. He often inserted too many "嗄" sounds and English single words, but mispronounced them. This made one weary of even an interesting and worthwhile topic of discussion.</p>
<p>In that messy and unadorned conversation, he also mentioned that Europeans and Americans marry late, "Foreigners marrying in their thirties and forties is very common. Isn't King Edward VIII a good example?"</p>
<p>I told everyone about these words, especially emphasizing the phrase "the station has no foreigners." The baggage clerk Guo Boxiang, a man from the West, was the first to jump up.</p>
<p>"Damn it, the whole of China is ruined by that bunch of traitorous scoundrels. Chinese agencies using foreigners...! Foreign slaves, down with them—"</p>
<p>The telegraph operator Chen Ke, whose actions were cunning, insidious, and as poisonous as a wild wolf, dragged Guo Boxiang outside and muttered to him for a long time.</p>
<p>In an accidental quarrel, Guo Boxiang, incited by Chen Ke, started fighting with Fu Changming.</p>
<p>"If you have the ability, go fight the ×× people."</p>
<p>Fu Changming's body was thin and short, his skin had many brownish-yellow spots due to paleness, his small eyes showed a gray and listless color, and his limbs and features all suffered from incomplete development. Unable to withstand the brute force of the Shanxi man, he fell to the foot of the wall. He covered his nose with his thin hand, which was nothing but skin and bones, and made a faint, weak sound, as if a newly born kitten had suffered a huge trauma.</p>
<p>This is something worth studying for psychologists: what is the psychology of an arrogant, narrow-minded, and selfish character after being shamed in public.</p>
<p>As a result, no one saw him open his mouth to smile for more than a week.</p>
<p>However, Chen Ke's vicious methods were once again displayed to everyone. He stroked Fu Changming's thin arm and said, "We really consider your misfortune to be a regrettable thing, but you must forgive him because our stationmaster is not a foreigner."</p>
<p>The short, humiliated man cracked a pale, bitter smile on his face.</p>
<p>"嗄, no fear 嗄, if you have the ability, go fight, fight 嗄..."</p>
<p>This difficult situation was resolved when I dragged him out for a walk.</p>
<p>We walked silently along the tracks.</p>
<p>The train roared across the fields. -- The air was noisy, clamorous, and turbulent, like a cavalry suddenly appearing in a surprise attack. But immediately, tranquility, with a hand that extinguished the buds of chaos, quickly restored all disturbances to calm.</p>
<p>Fu Changming's life was truly pitifully monotonous. After work, he didn't know how to use his limited spare time and wasted much precious time on drinking, gambling, and visiting brothels (though perhaps only once). As a result, his personality became irritable, selfish, stupid, stubborn, suspicious, and greedy...</p>
<p>He told me that he had quickly restored his friendship with Guo Boxiang:</p>
<p>"Old Guo is an honest man."</p>
<p>Three days after the fight, the drunken Shanxi man vomited a mouthful of wine on him and said, "We are all good friends, people who are away from home rely on friends, Chen Ke ridiculed me for being a pus-filled bag, saying I couldn't beat you, now I've shown him."</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Huisheng</p>
<p>"Life and death hang in the balance," this is a common Shanghai saying, meaning that life is in danger.</p>
<p>For example, if a person is careless about their diet and develops a serious illness, but then recovers thanks to good fortune, they will say when others ask about their illness: "Life and death hung in the balance!"</p>
<p>Life is the most precious thing, and illness endangers life! Therefore, if a person is sick, whether it is mild or severe, they should quickly take effective medicine. Otherwise, not only will "life and death hang in the balance," but they will also "lose their life," which is lamentable!</p>
<p>Where can you buy effective medicine? I don't need to say much, of course, the products of the Wuzhou Pharmacy are the most reliable. Wuzhou's 300 kinds of household medicines are all effective. Patients should buy and take the medicine that matches their symptoms, and they won't have to fear that "life and death hang in the balance."</p>
<h3>Short Stories (Three)</h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>Everyone Has a Cough</p>
<p>These past few days, the northwest wind has been blowing very hard. Zhang's wife has a cough, and Li's grandmother also has a cough. Uncle Wu said: "Quickly buy a bottle of 'Mai Ye Cough Syrup' to take. I guarantee your coughs will stop after taking it." (Cough syrup is a Wuzhou product)</p>
<p>Sores Are Healed</p>
<p>Little brother had to go to school every morning, so he got chilblains on his feet, which were red, swollen, painful, and itchy. It was truly unbearable! Later, his father bought chilblain medicine from the Wuzhou Pharmacy and applied it to him, and his chilblains quickly healed.</p>
<p>Economical Beauty</p>
<p>Elder sister spent forty cents to buy a pound of "Beauty Cream" from the Wuzhou Pharmacy, took it home, and filled two large jars, enough for the whole family to use for half a year. So everyone said she was an economical beauty expert.</p>

<p>It is said that the rift between Fu Changming and Chen Ke was because Fu Changming once visited a prostitute, and Chen Ke discovered this secret and revealed it to everyone. As a result, a deadly feud was formed.</p>
<p>"Even some ascetic monks will occasionally break their vows. Should we not be too demanding of a bachelor who has never had a single exception?" Chen Ke said humorously. His subtle narratives often added a lot of interest to the story itself...</p>
<p>We returned to the station. Fu Changming shook my hand, as if concluding, and said: "In short, conspiracy, our national character is ruined by conspiracy."</p>
<p>His shortsightedness caused his observation to fail. -- Why couldn't he discover the conspiracy of our common enemy? Why don't we feel resentment when we suffer major insults from others?</p>
<p>But that selfish fellow was never willing to "repent" of his mistakes.</p>
<h3>Dream</h3>
<p>— Kong Fang</p>
<p>Dreams are beautiful, the hopes in dreams are bright, the realms in dreams are vivid. I like dreams, and I often dream.</p>
<p>During the day, dissatisfaction and anger with the reality fill my chest, suffocating me. I spend my days suffocating like this.</p>
<p>But at night, I begin to seek sweetness in dreams. The world I dream of is ideal. There is no sorrow, no worry, only happiness and joy fill the entire realm. There is no poverty and wealth, no toil and ease, only each person doing their best. I forget reality there, but once I remembered it, and I said in surprise:</p>
<p>"How different this world is from the other one!"</p>
<p>"This is the world of dreams," someone replied.</p>
<p>"How was this world built?"</p>
<p>"With blood and flesh."</p>
<p>"Blood and flesh?" I didn't believe it. I lowered my head to look, ah? This ground was actually a crystallization of blood and flesh. I raised my head, ah? Those buildings, those high-rises, were all blood...flesh...</p>
<p>Then I woke up with a start.</p>
<p>I was puzzled by my dream.</p>
<p>Perhaps others will laugh at my dream, but let them laugh: who in the world doesn't dream! I must still bravely pursue my own dreams.</p>
<p>Although dreams may only be dreams, dreams are the mother of everything. When there are no dreams, there is no world.</p>

On Rotten Axe Mountain at Cold Dew, startled wild geese, frost and reeds fall on the White Water Beach. At the Beginning of Winter, one drinks heartily in the Unicorn Pavilion. At Minor Snow, one feasts at the Long Pavilion. At Major Snow, the Immortals gather at the Yao Terrace. At the Winter Solstice, the pipa is too lazy to play.

<h3>1937 Style Love</h3>
<p>Nanjing Will Show "Streamlined Love"</p>
<p>Director Van Dyke's latest elaborate creation, "Streamlined Love," will be screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater this Thursday. The film is full of intense passion and a brand new kind of romantic sentiment, like a cluster of fiery red tulips by the waterside on a spring morning, or like a glass of clear amber champagne under the tempting light of goose-yellow. This film is Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's greatest success in years. The stars are Hollywood's number one woman, the hot girl Joan Crawford from "Political Sea Heroines," and the tough, passionate heartthrob Clark Gable, with supporting roles by Joan Crawford's true love interest, Franchot Tone, and Regina Owen, among others.</p>
<h3>World Epic "Loyalty and Righteousness"</h3>
<p>Premiering Tonight at the Grand Theater</p>
<p>The world-shaking, historically tragic, and romantic epic "Loyalty and Righteousness" Lloyds of Locdon, is scheduled to premiere tonight (Wednesday) at 9:15 PM at the Grand Theater. The film tells the story of Nelson and Jonathan, who were very good friends in childhood. Later, because they discovered the secret plan of the pirates on the beach, which was detrimental to the Lloyds of London insurance company, Jonathan, valuing righteousness, traveled hundreds of miles to London to report the news, while Nelson was taken away by his uncle at this time to be a cadet in the navy. From then on, Jonathan served in the Lloyds insurance company, while Nelson had a smooth career, rising to the rank of admiral of the navy. Later, because Napoleon disturbed the whole of Europe and merchant ships often encountered danger, the company colleagues wanted to ask Nelson to allocate a part of the fleet to escort the merchant ships, but Jonathan, because the strength of the navy was related to the safety of the country, uniquely disagreed. Fortunately, a wealthy woman expressed sympathy to him. Later, although Nelson died for his country, Napoleon was greatly defeated, Jonathan really made a great contribution, and the Fux Administration specially invited Henry King to direct this film. The lead roles are played by the beautiful star Madeleine Carroll, the little star Freddie Bartholomew, and the dashing star Tyrone Power, among others. When this film was screened simultaneously in major theaters in the United States, the seat prices were increased, but the Grand Theater, in order to maintain its principle of never increasing prices, still charges the original price.</p>
<h3>Xinhua Variety Records</h3>
<p>The suspenseful and terrifying blockbuster "Midnight Song," directed by Ma-Xu Weibang, will be screened at the Jincheng Theater, following "New Year's Money." This film has a reasonable story, correct consciousness, and the performance is extremely bizarre, making one's hair stand on end.</p>
<p>"Midnight Song" has three songs: one is the theme song, one is Hot Blood, and the other is Huanghe Love, all of which are extremely melodious and moving.</p>
<p>The location shooting for "Midnight Song" was in Suzhou and Hangzhou, rich in poetic and picturesque scenes.</p>
<p>Zhou Wenzhu, after a long absence, plays a wizened old woman with wrinkled skin and white hair in "Midnight Song," and her performance is quite humorous.</p>
<p>In "Midnight Song," there is a scene where the tower is overturned while chasing the "monster" Jin Shan, with over a thousand people participating in the performance, making it extremely lively.</p>
<p>The production of "Xiangjiang Night Rain" has reached a critical stage.</p>
<p>Chen Juanjuan plays the daughter of Diao Banhua in "Xiangjiang Night Rain." According to the plot, the second half is almost entirely her acting world.</p>

<h3>Summary of Safety Features in 1937 Model Cars</h3>
<p>— Ling Yun</p>
<p>Brakes Offer Maximum Power and Other Equipment Strives for Safety Assurance</p>
<p>The characteristics of the 1937 model cars have been repeatedly documented in this publication. To mention the most prominent ones, there are the ease of driving, the prevalence of mechanical power, the comfort of riding, and the beauty of the design. However, there is one more crucial point that car users must not overlook: the greatest efforts made in terms of safety in the new cars, resulting in more perfect achievements. We need not elaborate on the value of cars and their wide range of uses. However, after purchasing a car, anyone will travel hundreds of thousands of miles. During this long journey, whether for business use or leisure travel, although the purposes may vary, the desire for reliable service is universal. Therefore, the occurrence of accidents is not only heartbreaking for the car owner but also unwelcome by the manufacturers. Yet, accident reports are constantly appearing. The records in newspapers would exhaust the bamboo of the Southern Mountains. What is the reason for this? Is it due to the manufacturer's oversight or human error?</p>
<p>Car manufacturers have learned from the past and realized the complexity of this problem. They know that a solution cannot be achieved overnight. Therefore, they have made the most precise considerations in their due diligence, so that safety is also given considerable value in the overall development of the new cars. Thus, when the 1937 new cars are launched, it would be absurd to guarantee that accidents will not occur. However, new cars have indeed made significant progress in the degree of effort put into safety facilities in terms of mechanical structure. If they can be used properly and the principles of rationalization are not violated in driving, then the reduction and prevention of accidents are not unattainable. It all depends on human effort and cannot be generalized. The main points regarding the safety of new cars are as follows:</p>
<p>Tire blowouts, although not a major disaster, can lead to unimaginable accidents if the driver mishandles the situation. In recent years, thanks to the research and thinking of chemists, the manufacturing of tires has been refined, and such incidents have become rare. Brakes are the lifeline of safe driving. If this device fails, the occurrence of accidents is almost certain. Such is their importance. The brakes of the 1937 model cars are all strong and reliable, focusing on power. They can respond easily to sudden changes, with the ability to control the smallest details and release great power. Therefore, when the car is not traveling too fast, it can come to a complete stop immediately when needed, as stable as Mount Tai. If you want to accelerate immediately while driving, it is essential to have a large amount of reserved power. This is something that most mechanical scholars can explain. The new cars meet this requirement, with ample power reserved and ready to accelerate as much as possible. The car roof is the highest point of the car and must be strong enough to look down from above. The new car roofs are all made of strong metal, and their load-bearing capacity is several times higher than the weight of the entire car. One manufacturer, to show the strength of its new car's roof, built a farmhouse on top of its sample car, which was surprisingly stable and extraordinary. Those who saw it were amazed.</p>
<p>Car users expect everything from new cars, and new cars seem to follow their instructions one by one. What customers don't want, manufacturers will eliminate. What customers expect, manufacturers will gather. This is why new cars can satisfy people's wishes. Unpleasant noises while driving and miscellaneous engine noises are not liked by passengers, and they have now been eliminated. For safety reasons, the power of the brakes must be huge, as mentioned earlier, and now each manufacturer is following suit. The one-piece solid steel body is a great guarantee of safe riding. Better uniformity and spring suspension have become popular. This is closely related to the comfort of riding. Now, riding in a new car is like sitting in an armchair while traveling on the road. The center of gravity of the car has also been moved down so that the car can adhere to the road surface even more, making it safer. Safety glass, also known as shatterproof glass, has been regarded as a necessary standard equipment for all cars. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Overview of the 1937 Chevrolet Car</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>The 1937 Chevrolet car, known as "the best and most perfect new product" in the world, is now on display in the showroom of the local dealer, Li Wei Automobile Company, at 100 Meyer Road. It is scheduled to be officially exhibited within a few days to make its first appearance to the people of Shanghai. The author will briefly describe its overview as follows to provide information to readers.</p>
<p>The new Chevrolet is divided into two major groups: the Leader Series and the Deluxe Series. Each group has six body styles. In terms of the chassis, engine, or car body, these two groups of new products are the same without any difference. The only differences are the front spring suspension, rear axle, steering gear ratio, as well as decoration and accessory installation. Knee-action was previously installed separately and charged extra, but now it has become a standard feature on the Deluxe Chevrolet new car, without the need for additional costs. As for the Leader Series new car, it is equipped with elliptical front springs. The wheelbase of both groups of new cars is 112 and a quarter inches.</p>
<p>Regarding the various aspects that have been specially improved and refined, the common features of the two groups of new cars are the brand-new six-cylinder overhead valve engine. In addition to being lighter and extremely strong, it is quieter and more powerful than before. Therefore, at any speed, its original power and torque are stronger, and its effectiveness is unprecedented. In addition, the common feature of the two groups of new cars is the streamlined body. This body is made of all-steel construction and is absolutely quiet. Furthermore, due to the use of a suspended rear axle and a bridge-type frame, the body is lower and the length is slightly increased. The beauty of its style and the safety and comfort enjoyed by those who are in it have reached the peak, far beyond the reach of ordinary vehicles in the same price range. The suspended rear axle was previously only used in expensive vehicles. Now, the new Chevrolet also has this device, which is truly a pioneering feat in low-priced vehicles. In addition, all models of the new Chevrolet are equipped with safety glass, without additional charges. This is also rare and uncommon in low-priced cars.</p>
<p>The seats of the new Chevrolet are wider, and the head and legroom are greatly increased. The windshield area is larger, and the corner pillars are narrower, so the line of sight is clearer. The doors and windows have been widened, and the luggage space has been greatly increased. The front seat is flexible and can be adjusted at will to enjoy extreme comfort. The gauges and controllers have been redesigned and their positions have been corrected. The windshield has just the right inclination, so there is no risk of refraction or glare. With all these advantages, the safety, comfort, and convenience of the new car are outstanding and unmatched.</p>
<p>The frames of the Chevrolet Deluxe and Leader Series new cars are both exceptionally strong and lightweight bridge types, safe, reliable, and durable. As for the transmission, the transmissions installed on both groups of cars are synchronized. The brakes are both improved and refined hydraulic types. With these equipments, the driving is extremely simple, flexible, and safe.</p>
<h3>Washing Machine Motor Converted into a Small Car</h3>
<p>— (Y)</p>
<p>Biel, a resident of William City, New Jersey, USA, recently hand-built a small car. Its engine is a converted washing machine motor, and the car body is made of plywood. The picture shows the full appearance of this small car. Although small in shape, it is actually streamlined. The power of the engine allows it to travel 14 to 16 miles per hour on a good road.</p>
<h3>The Exhibition of the New Oldsmobile Car is Scheduled</h3>
<p>According to reliable information, the 1937 model of the new Oldsmobile car has arrived in Shanghai and will soon be officially exhibited at the United Motor Company on Meyer Road. It is also heard that in addition to the more beautiful appearance and the more luxurious interior decoration of the new car, the entire structure and mechanical engineering are even more advanced than before. Therefore, its strength, consolidation, economic endurance, and the fullness of the machine power and the greatness of its effect are unmatched.</p>
<h3>Camera on the Car Windshield</h3>
<p>— (Y)</p>
<p>There is a three-lens camera that hangs on the windshield. When another car violates traffic laws while driving, it can automatically take three clear photos and record the time and date on them. After one use, the film can be automatically converted for the next application. The three pictures here are the three types of photos actually taken. The first larger picture shows the route of the violating car and its location relative to other cars and pedestrians. The two pictures below are close-ups, and the license plate number of the violating car can also be clearly identified. The inventor of this machine is Mr. Fei Qierte of Washington, USA. He suggested that the police authorities adopt this machine. Anyone who voluntarily installs this machine will have clear evidence when vehicles violate traffic laws or accidents occur. If the photos are sent to the authorities, they will accept them and warn or punish the violators.</p>
