<h3>我方遵約撤兵日軍陣地並未移動</h3>
<p>反將大批軍火運往前線　前途如何推演殊難判斷</p>
<p>［北平］中日决定二十一晨雙方撤兵後、蘆溝橋五里店大井村之日軍、本應同時撤退、但截至二十二晚六時止、日軍毫無撤退模樣、並增加大小鋼砲二十餘門、蘆溝橋以東一帶、亦運到大批毒瓦斯、似此情形前途難測、（二十三晨一時本報急電）</p>
<p>［北平］關於前方撤兵情况、截至下午六時止、未接續報、本社特派員亦未返城、惟聞日軍在前綫陣地並未移動、僅各地人數略爲减少、故前途如何推演、尚難遽斷、（二十二日專電）</p>
<p>［北平］記者今晨因前方雙方軍隊後移、特驅車擬出彰儀門赴蘆溝橋城視察戰蹟、到城門口時、據守城軍警告稱、日軍大部仍在大井村一帶、恐通行困難、力阻前往、乃廢然而返、（二十二日專電）</p>
<p>［天津］據此間關係方面確息、華北最高當局意旨、目前我方力避衝突、先作到雙方撤兵之目的、將來之交涉、將由中日雙方政府以外交途徑謀善後解决、（二十二日專電）</p>
<p>［南京］據北平電稱、蘆溝橋宛平桑乾河兩岸雙方互退一二里、其作用在避免雙方步槍機構有效射程、僅爲停戰第一步措施、於整個談判和平前途、尙有若干距離、若認爲協定中之一項、則屬錯誤、（二十二日專電）</p>
<p>［北平］日武官今井今訪湯爾和、據表示、日軍决陸續撤退、希望和平解决、平漢路北平至蘆溝橋段路軌、今日下午修復、當發現被日砲擊燬數處、及未炸之砲彈數枚、客車通行、尙待與日軍交涉、鐵道兩旁日軍仍潛伏高粱地內、無撤退模樣、（二十二日專電）</p>

<p>［北平］蘆溝橋事件發生後、迄今半月、我當局始終表示和平、并於二十一日首先移動該地駐軍、以石友三部填防、日軍亦表示願撤退、二十二移動情形如下、一、在平漢路涵洞地方之日軍、截至二十二下午五時止、僅留少數步兵、大部隊伍向豐台方面退、二、在大瓦窰郭莊子一帶日軍、向五里店方面移動、三、大井村方面日軍、砲兵百餘名、携陸砲十餘門、二十二晨已向豐台移動、中日軍隊已開始撤退、一切問題、從長討論、但駐紮大瓦窰一帶日軍、二十二晨一時五十分、以大砲向我軍防地轟擊、落彈十餘發、我方未還擊、旋由監視撤兵員周永業等向日軍質問、據答、係撤兵時掩護砲、並非向中國方面進攻等語、砲聲旋卽停止、至下午一時許、又有重砲發自五里店日軍防地、凡三響、比經交涉、其答覆仍與前同、（二十三日專電）</p>
<p>［北平］官息、當局爲亟謀恢復平漢路交通、二十一日商同日方、將沿蘆溝橋鐵道左右側之雙方軍隊、同時他移、日軍現仍在向豐台方面陸續撤移中、當晚砲兵一部、携陸砲十一門、已撤往豐台、雙方前所派之監視撤兵員周永業•周思靖•中島•櫻井等、均曾前往前綫、相互監視一次、（三十二日專電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>言論界之總動員</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>值此全民族抗敵救亡戰綫展開之日。正言論界應全部總動員之時。彼侵略我領土屠殺我同胞之國家。全國報紙尚如火如荼激勵士氣。吾被害之國民。領可無妝烈之呼號悲憤之浩嘯。夫衝鋒殺敵。慷慨犧牲。軍民之常前任務也。奮起軍心。激揚民氣。言論界之常前任務也。政府與報界。處此非常時期。應有非常之合作與努力。用舉弊端。以作貢獻</p>
<p>第一。全國言論界應卽有嚴密之組。依當前民族門爭中最迫切之需要。决定工作之共同方針。與施行之具體辦法。敵刃在胸。敵劍在頭。常救死不暇之時。言論界應一致為抗敵政府之後盾政府應予言倫界以充份便利。惟現狀之下。以言論界之缺乏組織與之結。分道揚鑣。力量不大。政府欲施統制。亦往往捉襟見肘。效率來著。甘矯枉過正。反遠本意。欲求統制之有効。莫如言論界本身有組織。自行統制。統制之原則方針。可本政府之意旨。共實施運用。則由言論界主持。如是對內則可以表現全民族敵之一致精神。對外亦可以代表公意以有生氣之言論示全世界以中華民族之毅力與决心。</p>
<p>第二。言論界之有力量。有生氣。共先决條件。爲消息之自由。健全之民意。由於正確之認識。而正確之認識。又由於眞實之記載。補風捉影之談。麻木不仁之論均由於不知實在之情形。著實在之消息為純正判斷之基礎也。廬山談話會中。張志讓君會提出政府於言論自由及新聞檢查等。應速予改善。吾人深信今日之政府非不重視自由之言論。檢查新聞實不得已之辦法因肓目之產論。較無言論為更有害。氣根據之記載。此無記載為更危險。然檢查常以去偽為標凖。使精確之消息遂於民衆之前。民衆乃能認識其目前危局。而生熱烈之感情與愛國之行動。設某種消息。如關於軍事行動外交秘密如公佈之卽有害於國家利益者。則當使負責之言論機關知之雖不發表。然言論界了解實况。其所發意見。始能符合當前要求。不至於隔靴搔癢也。</p>
<p>第三。為顧全民族之利益新聞統制網賞求其周密全國言論界與政府當嚴屬防止及取締造謠之外國記者與通訊社。值此非常時期國際視。當使其純粹正確現日本在華之通訊社通信員及報紙記載充滿惡意而英美者又多好作誇大。發為怪誔之談。故吾人常設法阻止外國人利用租界及領事裁判權逍遙乎檢查網之外更應傾政府及人民之全力取締或徘斥外字之造謠報紙。如荒謬之敵方通訊社稿。吾人可根本拒絕登載。妨及吾國利益之報紙。可予以停郵之處分。凡此諸端。本國報紙。應恊助政府。共同努力。</p>
<p>此次華北事變次非局部事件之可比全國上自蔣委員長下至販夫走卒均已有寧死不屈之决心。吾人斷不容塘沽恊定何梅恊定之類。再產生於今日吾人斷不許人開之數軍再演瀉陽九一八之惡劇。吾人更不許三邊史守將遠惑於和平談判之煙幕。而開門以迎盜全國兵力物力人力之總動員已屈其。而民意之總動員其責任在於言論界。供獻事實。使民衆認識。供獻意見使民衆行動。明察秋毫。為民耳目。大聲疾呼。爲民喉舌。不然此偉大之中華民族。必然昏昏而亡國。默默然而滅族。千秋萬世。不我諒也。</p>

<p>［華盛頓］德國駐美大使狄考夫今日與國務部長赫爾及次長韋爾斯會商關於遠東時局之國際問題、會議畢後、三氏雖皆無所表示、然據可靠方面消息、狄大使已向美國保證、德國决不干預遠東方面之爭端、且希望他國亦能如此、因恐遠東之戰事、或將引起世界戰爭云、據悉赫氏對於德國之“不干涉”政策、殊為歡迎、蓋近年來德國對於國際危機、能與美國採取相同之熊度、此猶為第一次也、赫氏與德使會晤之前、中國大使王正廷及日、本大使齋藤亦先後造訪、交換遠東方面最近之情報、機赫氏向新聞記者稱、美國對於各方情形、非常注意、倘有保全和平之機會、美國盡力效勞、除此以外、則並無共他發展、同時此間正式宣布、星期二北平日兵侮辱美國女子一事、日本使館衛隊司令已向美國使館衛隊司令正式道歉云、（𠥻一日國民電）</p>

<h3>美麗盃單打複賽張定釗敗於卡遜</h3>
<p>昨以三對一盤受挫　史規亞亦獲决賽權</p>
<p>康悌會主辦之美麗盃網球鄭標養、昨日共賽兩單打及一雙打、單打賽對卡遜對張定釗保爭彎决賽權、原定四時比賽、則四卡遜誤卯、延于五時始舉行、比賽採五賽三勝制、雙方實力頰平衡、賽來局勢緊張非凡、卡遜昨賽棋砲彈式之開球、始得獲務、間張定釗亦實力充足、難强勁如卡遜、有時亦被張所屈服、張失敗之主因、在於反手抽擎無力、由卡之開球、張使有無法招架之勢、否通卡遜危矣、總結果為三對－、張定釗慘被淘汰、現我華人球員、對本旭美麗盃單打錦標、告絕望、另一場復賽為史規亞對福初斯、雙方球藝相彷、打來旗鼓相當、結果史規亞以有力之長抽、擎敗半皮購之福初斯、與卡遜同得决賽權、决賽日期、已定明日舉行、過時兩雄相遇、來卜鹿死誰手、雙打賽施棣生蔡惠棠組則被安德律進斯緹波治喬夫組、以二對一所淘汰、茲將昨賽結果及今日秩序誌下、</p>

<h3>一九三七年惠勃爾登網球大會（十）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐歐記者列山</p>
<p>第八日</p>
<p>惠勃勇登第八日又是女子單打的節日對於男子軍打事前我們敢終預料、最後决賽的兩人、大約不外勃奮與克蘭姆、一說到女子單打就困難得多了、這七位女‘主將’幾乎都有同樣的實力、甚至於連婦後的四個人是誰、我們都無法推測、今天比賽的結果、除了波蘭傑十喬斯卡女士的勝利、在我們意料之中心外、其餘二場都來得多少有點突然、</p>
<p>馬秀夫人勝李沙納女士、六比三、六此二、</p>
<p>馬蒲耳女士勝史波苓夫人、七此五、二比六、六比三、</p>
<p>蘭持女士勝傑可勃女士、六比四、六比二、</p>
<p>其實、以球藝來論、失敗的三位恰恰都有戰勝的可能、這也許受了個人健康的影響或者運用戰略的錯誤、但到底為了什么緣故、沒有人能夠解釋、大家總覺得失敗得有點‘突然’、</p>
<p>▲李沙納敗得可惜</p>
<p>失敗得敢慘的個人、自然是李沙納女士、今年度的世界女子網球錦標不但以她的呼聲最高、更值得同情的、就是她在英國十八個月、一切費用、由智利全國人民供給、(一共花了五千英鎊、全國捐款情助一位網球家、也許這還是歷史上第一次、)所以她失敗後、她覺得對不起自己同人的熱望在更衣室中她足足哭了一個事鈡頭、她的傷心、我們是能夠了解的她新近本來已同一位蘇格蘭人訂了婚并且也預備不久結婚、但此次的刺激太大了被她對各報記者表示、她已同她的未婚夫商量好，把婚期延長一年、明年惠勃爾登大會時、她的名字還是李沙納、一位時常受親衆歡迎的李沙納、</p>
<p>這裏、我們覺得鐵爾登的預言不錯、馬秀夫人達到最後四人的階叚、多少還靠她自己的本領、她今年已經二十九歲了、一位有了兩個孩子的母親、她每年度都參加了惠勃爾登比賽、可是始終得不到錦標、今年度的希望也不見得怎么大、她碰到蘭特女士以後、還有波蘭美國的冠軍在那里、蘭特女士兩三個月來沒有在球場上露過面、也許今年她是一個、“冷門”、一家英國報紙說馬秀夫人是個網球場上罕見的人物、當她得到法國女子單打幼年級的錦標時、她已經是一位結了婚的太太、這位記者的話多少有點刻薄、</p>
<p>▲傑可勃敗於蘭特</p>
<p>同樣的、去年世界冠軍美國傑可勃士女士的失敗、也使一般親衆覺得麗奇、令天蘭特女士的球藝特別好、而傑女士特別壞、第一盤傑女士曾以四比二佔先、這時候蘭特女士、突然奮發、上前攔網幾乎是每發必中、後來更是福至心無、連她平時最弱的正手抽球、此時都能夠運用自如，而且擊出的球都是恰恰過綱、有時還是碰網上純過結果她連上四局勝第一盤、</p>
<p>第二盤時傑可勃士女士更一撅不振、蘭特女士一鼓作氣、中間只失了兩局、去年的一位錦標、在這么絕望的情境中下場、大部分觀衆都對她深致同情蘭特女士照今天的成績觀來、錦標的希望又輸高了許多、以個人的球藝說、她是七人中最平均的一位、雖說設有什么特長的地方、但也沒有弱點、各方面都可以對付、只要她戰略運用得當時、她很可以利用對方的弱點、而得到最後的勝利、</p>
<p>▲馬蒲耳宛如勃奇</p>
<p>馬蒲耳女士戰勝史波苓夫人、是今天最精彩的一幕、史波苓夫人是歐洲第一名手、歷來不知道多少女網球家都是她的芋中敗將、她的球藝比蘭特女士還要穩重、然而她也同京蘭嬌•克勞福一樣、是正統派的網球家、去年在惠勃爾登最後决賽時敗於傑可勃士女士、就因為對方採取新式戰略的綠故、馬蒲耳女士的特長在於發球與上前攔網、只要她這個武器應用得法時、便可以擊敗任何名手、而今天却又是她得意的一日、第一盤時史波苓夫人曾以五比四佔先、這時候馬蒲耳女士好像抱了一個非勝即敗的决心、她的正手抽球并攔網、幾乎有惠勃爾登第一流男網球家的風度、（馬蒲耳女士擊球的姿勢有點像勃奇、）轉瞬用反而以七比五的比數勝第一盤、</p>
<p>第二盤情形恰相反、馬蒲耳女士的老毛病、正手抽球又送出弱點、史波苓夫人勝了這一盤比數為六比二、</p>
<p>第三盤開賽後、史波苓夫人還是應用她第二盤時的方法、專門向對方的右方進攻、比數為三比○、史波苓夫人佔先、這詩候突然來了轉機、馬蒲耳女士忽抱了一個破斧沈舟的熊度、她的正手抽球的分量是可怕的、球擊出後立刻上網、她迅速的奔跑、根本沒有讓史波苓夫人仔細考慮的機會、史波苓夫人何過來的球不是不能過網、便是給她劈住、或者變成越出界綫的野球、就這樣她連下了六局、反面以六比三的比數、獲得最後的勝利、假如我們不是眼見的話、决想像不出一位女網球家也有這種本領、馬蒲耳女士是月前美國的冠軍、今天這一戰以後、本覺得她‘名不盧傳’、她今年就得不到世界錦標、可是明後年總是有希望的、</p>
<p>傑士喬斯卡女士勝來十分容易、她以六比一、六比二的比數勝史克萊文女士、這位波蘭小姐身體的結實、惠勃爾登女將中沒有人比得上她、她擊球的硬度并球落到對方陣地時的分量、也無人可與比擬、她今天是最後四人中之一、下一次比賽時她將遇到馬蒲耳女士、雖然、到底誰勝誰負、我們不敢預言、但馬蒲耳女士却不容易有上網的機會、假如馬蒲耳女士不能夠應用她的攔網技術時、也許她會失敗的、</p>
<p>男子變打的第三連賽已經結束、三對‘主將’、并孟瑟耳與黑區特的一對、都平安無事渡過、女子雙打、混合雙打一部分第四週審也已開始、惠勃爾登只乘下四日、離閉幕時愈近、戰情就愈緊張、大家都在等待着、今年度的盟主到底是誰、</p>

<h3>證券</h3>
<p>空方似在抵補　統一債激漲兩三元</p>
<p>昨華商證券交易所公債市况、漸轉高峰、形勢稍轉、空方起恐慌、抵補紛起、市價飛騰、兩星期被重重壓迫之債市、至此稍稍得露頭角、昨日經過、開盤因形勢和緩、各帮需要驟殷、漲風甚熾、各債市漲二元餘至三元半不等、三號十四•十八•四十五•五十及二十四號等買進、祇六號十號稍有賣出、次盤臨時多　稍有結出、祇戊種好一角半、餘則稍稍回小二三角至七八角不等、成交總數、共計二千九百零八萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<p>公債套利豐厚</p>
<p>在今日債市近疲遠堅（兩月形勢比較）之現象下、前此卽爲大量購買、於今亦可證其爲投機、蓋因七月期公債可收入三元之利息請看昨日收盤市價（頭盤姑且不言）、本月份僅較八月期貴四角、則有二元六角之收益、如係投資套和二元六角、除七折、則公債利息竟達三分五厘餘之瓦、如此高利率、金融界尚且旁觀、可見投機風浪阻遇投資之書、現在倡言積極推進利率政策、以及改行統一公債之初衷、而今安在哉、謹將昨晨二盤二個月差數誌後、以供參考、</p>
<p>此種現象、已有多日、無論其需除佣金及賣買價格相差、但利息之優厚、舉世無敵、實極明顯、</p>
<p>紐市股市微挫</p>
<p>昨（二十一日）紐約股市飄忽無定、交易寥落、全日成交九十八萬股、據經紀人意見、價格有繼續參差之象、惟自前似無慘落之危機、故已購之股票、仍宜保留、現款充足者、更可乘跌加碼、</p>
<h3>金融</h3>
<p>標金烚赤昨均回跌</p>
<p>金市昨與烚赤一同回跌、公債回升、人心已定、晨初以倫敦生金勿動、中央銀行掛牌揭曉英美俱平關金勿動、標準金債仍爲一一三五元七角、晨開退爲一一四四元半、大德成五昌祥義豐永元茂永脫手、退至三元半、生源永元茂永納條升爲三元八角、義豐永裕新祥尚賣、午收退至一一四二元半、較前收回跌三元、較結價尚拾七元光景、烚赤加水轉低、約五十餘元、價爲一千二百元、由景福賣山一百四十兩、大豐恒七十兩、同豐恒五十兩、均由銀樓吸收之、本月份條子仍剩一百八十九條、八月份六百三十條、九月份八百五十四條、內計多方十四家、空方九家、半灭成交一百六十一條、</p>
<h3>烚赤飛漲索隱</h3>
<p>前日烚赤飛漲、飾金橫跳、聞係受長江及內地之影響、與公債下跌同是一種反映、蓋上海財主可以拋出、轉購外匯、內地的人、聽見公債下跌消息、連想所及情急無奈、只有爭購金之一途、此爲前日烚赤直接的漲因、而小銀行間接的感受動搖、</p>
<p>查烚赤的加水、一向以樣金依據、如果標金市價爲一一四零元、則烚赤應照加十五元左右、因爲標金成色九七八、烚赤成色生九九之上、兩者成色相差十三點、但自一十三年九月八日標金改行開金結債、迄今市况呆滞、來源遂亦沉寂、更因低利率政策關係、套利者亦陸續的放出現貨、中央則始終吸收、存底因是奇涸、標金又扼於結價、到期不得收貨、倫敦金價雖未見貴、但普通商人决無能力可以直接定購、伺况尚須水脚及一切雜费呢、各現貨號不得不量入爲出、愼重出售、於是赤金求過於供、市價遂突飛猛晋矣</p>
<h3>外滙供求紛繁</h3>
<p>結果近平遠硬</p>
<p>滙市昨初以海外電吿、倫敦大餘近縮一二五、遠縮○六二五、紐約銀市仍平、英對美升七毫、對法漲六十九生丁、對日勿動、美對英縮○六二五、對法跌二分八七五、對日勿動、晨開近期費價均與前收相同、惟遠期英美各鬆○三一二五、閒後洋行及華商力扒美金、銀行奮拋、匯豐掛牌英美俱平、逐步回鬆、遠期更甚、但銀行趁賤結進先令、客帮則扒東匯、中途多盤後市國外來拋美金、洋行仍扒日英兩滙、正金則扒美金、中行塞出、形勢仍鬆、收盤近期價、英美俱與前收相同、遠期均硬、日匯亦然、華商及洋行均扒國外及銀行則塞、北帮塞美而扒日成交熱烈、</p>
<p>英匯昨由麥加和大英扒十月份一二五、華義塞八月份一八七五、後市有利大英塞洋行九月份一五六二五、成交約八九萬鎊、</p>
<p>美匯昨由麥加利華義售予洋行九月份二八七五及二五、匯豐麥加利塞十月月份一五六二五及一八七五、麥加利上海塞九月份二五、有利麥利塞十一月份○九一二五•一二五及一八七五、大連帮售予花旗三井十月份、五國外售予花旗華比現貨五九三七五、有利塞十一月份一二五、後市花旗進國外八月份四三七五、麥加利出薪豐十月份一八七五、中行出正金八月份四三七五、成交約一百萬元、</p>
<p>東匯昨由正金•三麥售予天津及大連帮七月份一○一元七五、後市朝鮮正金售予洋行七月份一○一元七五、成交約六十餘萬元、</p>
<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>公債回昂棉紗迅速上騰　惟大阪現紗綫慘落</p>
<p>紗市復趨上升、浮空抵補、多頭活動、同時公債回昂、人心益佳、加之最近以來、各方實需暢達、倉庫中籌碼步步减縮、故市面鞏固、惟布疋交易呆鈍、而美棉狀况日非、大阪現紗綫慘落、二十支現紗價格已在高境中矣、</p>
<p>十月漲起五元二</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月轉趨上騰、人氣良好、浮空抵補、均漲一元九角至三元二角、但海外棉業狀况仍趨下游、不過現紗交易尚稱不薄、內地方面布廠進胃未呆、、盤以後依然穩固、十一十二兩個月期昨經理事及經紀人公會會長前赴監理員處面請、允許在登記證手續未竣以前係紗廠紗花商號、暫准營業才開拍矣、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價均漲二元半至五元二角、查賣出同與三百包、源大五百包、合興五百包、豐泰六百包、愼記四百五十包、簽昶三百五十包、大昶四百包、福康三百包、永大三百包、買進大孚五百包谷記二百包、同豐三百五十包、仁豐三百五十元、元一一千一百五十包、潤康九百五十包、生源三百五十包、茲將半日間市價列左、</p>
<p>日紗回漲三四元</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚佳、查全日各帮買去統計、千五百十六包售價平平、日紗漲三•四元不等、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>美棉狀况日非本棉昨起反動　連日狂跌後應有之現象</p>
<p>棉市連日狂跌後、昨則劇烈反動回升、此種情形、亦在意料之中、但現棉生意因價格低微、且遞來棉紗銷塲踴躍、廠方或有一度發展之望也、而期棉比較奇廉也、</p>
<p>陳花狂漲二元二</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、以紗市昂騰、目前日來跌風狂驟、一隅良好消息之援助、市價亦迅速回升、各月狂漲五角至一元二角、二盤以後、依然穩靜、迨至收盤、浮空抵補較夥、八月再跳七角、標花結果、陳花比上日收盤價漲一元二角、新漲一元至一元六角、查賣出同興一千八百擔、合興九百擔、瑞大　千二百擔、中大六百擔、愼記九百擔、泰昌七百擔、益昶一千四百擔、賚康六百擔、買進大孚二各二百擔、汾記千五百擔、申大一千六百擔、長餘一千四百擔、頥大一千擔、義成三千九百擔、生源一千擔、信誠二千一百擔、益康一千七百擔、茲將半日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>印棉消費仍岑寂</p>
<p>期棉狂跌多時、漸現回升安定之象、現棉廠方需求仍滯滯而不辦、不過棉紗客銷續而不○、環境稍能好轉、各廠或有發展之望也、碼頭到姚　二百包、又訊津漢等處受時局影響、市象飄忽不定云、</p>
<p>標紗恢復六個月期交易</p>
<p>標紗市場恢復六個月期一節、部令准許開拍、前日照常添掛十一十二月期、繼以登記手續麻煩、一時不及發給、未能照常交易、茲經理事及經紀人公會會長、前赴監理員處、將函陳困難　達、並請監理員俯察商困、在登記給證手續未竣以前、凡屬正當紗廠紗花商號委託買賣、暫准照常接受、以維營業、俾免停滯云、</p>
<p>世界棉市紛紛慘跌</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、利物浦消息不佳、多頭了結、外商紐奧崙及本地帮售出、天氣順利、蟲害不重、各月跌六至上一磅音、現需及布銷均劣、新買缺乏、雖有逢不貿進及空戶抵補、仍不敵賣氣之普遍人心、收盤平穏、計現貨跌十九磅音期貨跌十六至十九磅音英棉現貨跌九點、期貨跌十九至廿一點、印棉初以期貨商及空戶轉賣者拋售而跌、旋以同業買進、空戶抵補、棉商買進印棉、售出美棉、市價略回、卒以利物浦消息不佳再疲、計平果漲跌一•五至二羅比、奧姆辣跌二•七五至三羅比、白羅溪跌二•五至二•七一羅比、原電錄左、（二十一日電）</p>
<p>▲大阪　二十二日大阪電、現紗跌四至八元、十六支扇面二百三十五元、跌五元、二十支金魚二百五十五元、跌四元、四十支五星三百五十元、跌七元、四十二支雉子三百六十五元、跌八元、</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>東白細布成交獨旺</p>
<p>▲印花色工跌價出售　昨日棉布市况以標紗花一致回堅、東疋百貨買氣稍盛、由本埠染廠及批發號趁低盤購進一千餘件、以細布爲大宗、蓋長江帶色布蠢動、故急起抵補、染坯細布市盤回漲每疋五分一角之譜、惟細斜以客路色斜需胃平漲、市面仍疲弱、日商各洋行現貨印花坯布各色工之類、以印花廠需要衰落、頗多跌價出售、開價均能商减、惟成交甚稀、整理染色東貨直貢嗶嘰貢緞等貨、連續下跌　昨又降（每碼）厘半、本廠布疋白貨尙堅、川粤長江添辦仍殷、現貨不數供給、惟整理貨嗶嘰綫呢現銷尙稱活動、售盤平平、漂布藍布原先擯持不跌、現續有回小二三角不等、深淺色印花布疋疲滯不堪云、</p>
<p>▲元芳呌莊仍未開拍、昨週四、向逢本埠元芳洋行拍賣之期、爲北方時局不靖、晨間九時洋貨疋伴同業、在該行會議、行號雙方討論之下、决定再暫停　期、以觀時局、暫定下週四開拍云、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>西貢米定開四千噸　價爲七元五角四分　客秈南北去路不弱</p>
<p>昨客秞消化仍旺、油頭去胃旣貪、內地本街亦復不弱、西北洋威海各帮亦日有點綴、昨日成交又逾一萬六千包、高檔各米續挺四五分、以南北本客之活潑狀態論、後市或須再廣上砌也、惟西貢一號米新有定開四千噸、由某洋行等售出、價七元五角四分然加上捐稅、每石須十三元許、殊非商販所可通划也、惟客秞因此或可稍平、昨開出江西米五千八百十九包、湖米五千五百七十八包、漢糙五千包、</p>
<p>粉麥已多自動了結　粉廠亦已減少生産</p>
<p>粉麥市面、價格仍無變動、各月期因時局關係、巴多自動了結、雖標凖與現貨、距離尚遠、在此檔口、仿彿意與闌珊無復生氣流暢也、現貨情形、亦屬停噸、毫無明顯成交、面粉限止出口、各廠則已减少生產、小麥則因外埠粉價高昂、自然無心廉脫、此種殭局、恐非一時可能打破、而社會經濟、富亦不無影響去、</p>
<p>河下米漲風已止</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源三十餘號、貨共六千七八百石、前朝漲風、昨則尚有餘波、晨初門手、城鄕店胃續頗活絡、售方喊聲繼高、厚早粳行情悉增二三角不等、薄稻亦加角左右、惟午市突必轉呆、市色復趨軟化、厚薄粳均有回低幾分至角許者、照此情形而論、後市似又難以發展、或向於較軟之地位也、杜洋尖高　次甲、　　元到銷兩　、</p>
<p>（滬上）昨日滬上各地來源無幾、祗有十一二號、晨間開盤、因前市漲風未熾、客販又欲喊緊一角左右、面店方進意懈淡、局勢又轉平和、致各貨交易呆面滯細、所交亦屬有限、市形百梗定勞、早薄稻貨缺價未開、各秞及甚餘各貨均和平</p>
<p>黃豆爲餅銷帶起</p>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、不論新陳貨、均見良好局面新豆因高貨缺乏、各帮銷塲不懈、所以氣氣轉升七八分、成交城門豆四五百包、正陽豆二百十包、江橋豆三百包、珠溪豆六十一包、陳豆因豆餅去路依然活潑、共計做開期現各牌廠餅二萬餘片、行情漲起二分、故人必轉緊、暫不受連市跌風影響、但榨油廠辦胃反覺觀望、以係售價喊高之故、昨由本街廣帮等辦去郯城豆四百五十包、正陽關豆三車、及漢口乍豆四十包而已、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>白廠絲囤戶不乏出籠</p>
<p>昨日絲市晨疲午堅、用戶絲銷、帮帮昨有進胃、上海白廠及山東廠等、均出交易大致售盤、川魯經因本埠存底稀少、到貨不多、持價較堅、上海白廠售盤頗多參差、上午交易、囤戶出籠、有天台等級懂得七百八十元、本及絲有售七百六十元者甚謂最低新價、午後、因橫濱絲價回升、本埠人心亦趨好面、普通白廠盤旋在八百元上、揚返絲則在八百十五元左右矣、計成交八十擔、洋行絲市、英法未動、美莊仍寂、非銷略有購辦、計做開顧保綿等三十七擔</p>
<p>、</p>
<p>紅綠茶銷路復活潑</p>
<p>昨日紅綠茶市况、復趨活潑、祁寗兩路紅茶、存底不過二萬餘箱、英莊各洋行、聞悉安徽地方銀行、及贛省裕民銀行、有備款全部收買消息、進意突轉濃厚、恰和錦隆保昌等行、均多選購、人心頗爲興奮、路莊綠茶交易尚不寂寞、各貨中尤以細針眉秀眉銷勢最爲暢旺、目下存底雖不甚豐、然售價未見漲、中關珍眉•低莊珍眉•恊和福時寶隆略有購進、價巳比前見軟二角、平水茶市昨日錦隆辦國品大帮價四十一元、又恰和柝辦一品香大帮內數色、價尚平穩、恊和辦土莊丁文常百餘箱、價五十元左右、此外眉茶交易尚稱不寂云、</p>
<h3>南北貨</h3>
<p>榨菜開價回小元許</p>
<p>榨菜日來到貨見旺、近因時局關係、號家無意存棧、均欲急於脫手、致市回小一元許、正牌洛溪菜號盤開放至三十元、陵菜二十五元、目下客銷需股、生意正値當令、故市面尚見穩定、行售本牌二十六元、　裕通二十九元、鴻利越二十四元五角、增陵菜高二十二元、下檔二十元、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>釋“應戰”</h3>
<p>— 乃一</p>
<p>蔣委員長在廬山談話會第二次談話時，說，蘆溝橋事變的推演，是關係中國國家整個的問題，此事能否結束，就是最後關頭的境界。”又說，“如果臨到最後關頭，便只有拚全民族的生命，以求國家的生存，那時節再不容許我們中途妥協，須知中途妥協的條件，便是整個投降，整個滅亡的條件，全國國民最要認淸所謂最後關頭的意義，最後關頭一到，我們只有犧牲到底，抗戰到底，唯有　犧牲到底”清所謂最後能博得最後的勝利，若是徬徨不定，妄想苟安，便會陷民族於萬刦不復之地！”而“從這次事變的經過，知道人家處心積慮的謀我之亟，和平已非輕易可以求得，”因之眼前如果要求平安無事的祇有讓人家軍隊無限制的出入於我們的國土，而我們本國軍隊，反要任受限制，不能在本國土地內自由駐在，或是人家向中國軍隊開槍，而我們不能還槍；換言之，就是“人為刀俎，我為魚肉。”而這樣我們已快羅臨到這極人世悲慘的境地，”是舉凡“在世界上稍有人格的民族，都無法忍受的！”</p>
<p>這樣沉痛堅决的表示，正是幾年來人民所奔走呼求的，一旦聞之，無怪感奮莫名，羣慶雪恥有日，然而想不到有血氣者正當　欣聆國策已决，尤慶請纓有路”（見李白通電）之時，消息傳來，則蘆溝橋宛平一帶　我們本國軍隊”已經在“奉命撤退”了！</p>
<p>華北當局擅自撤退三十七師部隊而以保安隊接防的理由，據說是　表示和平解决，以促日方覺悟；”“覺悟”而要“促”，這使小民們實在莫測高深之至，而證之以政府所表示的立場；　第二十九軍現在所駐地區，不能受任何約束”，更不禁疑懽於　千古罪人”之有成約在先！不然，又何必撤兵！</p>
<p>然而所謂“以促日方覺悟”的成效又如何呢？本報二十一日北平專電云：“我方赴蘆換防之保安隊，行至門頭溝後，見日軍監視極發，日軍不僅亳無撤退模樣，且熊度頑强，………，”看來，這大槪又是一套“人家軍隊無限制的出入於我們的國土，而我們的本國軍隊，反要任受限制，不能在本國土地內自由駐在”的把戲而已；這樣結果，“平安無事”固“平安無事”矣，其奈“人為刀俎，我為魚肉”何！</p>
<p>而為了測騐日方是否蓄意挑釁，就先撤退自己的軍隊，這也是多荒唐的行為和藉口，“從這次事變的經過，知這人家處心積慮的謀我之亟”已經聞之熟矣，我們難道眞還要試騐一下“今日之冀察”，是否會變“成為昔日之東四省”嗎？</p>
<p>我們固然是一個弱國，但不能不保持我們民族的生命，不能不負起祖宗先民所遺留給我們歷史上的責任，所以到了必不得已時，我們不能不應戰。”到了現在，政府所昭吿的“始終一貫，”　且必以全力固守”的“最低限度”的四點立場旣遭了損害，這難道還不是“必不得已時”嗎？　人家的軍隊無限制的出入於我們的國土，”甚至無限止的源源而來，隨處建築工事，而就隨心所欲，砲轟槍擊，這難道又不是“必不得已時”嗎？</p>
<p>再要不然，我們什麼時候才再　應戰”呢？而　應戰”之謂，是否就是“只抵抗不還擊”的別名呢？</p>
<p>當然不是！</p>
<p>那麼，好，我們就等着看是　中途妥恊”，還是　應戰到底”吧。而人民，也將會從這歧途中决定他們的行動的。</p>

<h3>和平？覺悟？</h3>
<p>— 戰士</p>
<p>宋哲元石友三等復民族復興協會函電，“對華北事件，均表示絕大决心，誓死抗敵，决不惜任何犧牲。”已見昨日各報；但是二十一北平電，却是“此問當局對蘆溝橋事件，始終主張和平解决。二十一晨已令蘆溝以西以北我前方各地駐軍，暫時向後徹退一二里，所遺防務，由石友三部保安隊依次接防。保賢隊第一旅長程希賢，於二十一日晨十時起，率部前往接防，如日軍於我保安隊換防時期，不予攻擊，至午十二時可換防守竣。據關係方面稱：我方此次先行徹兵，卽係表示和平之鐵證，亦係促日方之覺悟：倘我軍撤退後，日軍仍不遵約撤退，其蓄意挑釁，已為舉世所共見，設不幸事件擴大，其責任當由日方負之。</p>
<p>日人“蓄意挑釁”，已經茫”舉世所共見”：蔣委員長在廬山談話會第二次談話時，亦有“這次蘆溝橋事件發生以徒，或有人以為是偶然的，但一月來對方與論或外交上直接間接的表示，都使抆們覺到事變發生的徵兆，而且事變發生前後，還播傳着種種的新聞，說是什么要擴大塘沽協定的範圍，要擴大冀東偽祖織，要驅逐二十九軍，要逼近寧哲元離開，諸如此類的新聞，不勝枚舉，可想見這一次事並不是偶然的。”身當最前綫的冀察諸公雞道還不清楚嗎？且再看一條二十二日晨的急電“我軍駐八寶山部隊於二十一晚七時二十分撤退，嘗撤退時，日軍又放六砲……”再要“表示和平”，再要“促日覺悟”，除非是把整個華化“拱手讓人”……。</p>
<p>不但此也，此次“遵約撤兵”，更違反了中央的意志，不知此次所“遵”的“約”是口頭的，還篷書面的？楚依據中央的意志，還是冀察諸公的本人意志？事悄已到“最後關頭，希望冀察諸公給我們（四萬萬五千萬的人民）明白的表示，同時希望中央堅决以蔣委員長所發表的解决蘆溝橋事伴的四點為談判的根據，否則惟有戰！有人“放棄尺寸土地與主權”，就是“中華民族的千古罪人！”</p>
<h3>借款是否應停止</h3>
<p>— 胡毅昂</p>
<p>開於兩款應否停止，十九日的“談言”內七繼很說得透徹了！“我們知道慰勞的作用，與其說結物質上的援助，還不如說是精神上的激勵來得確當，而因少許物質的媒介，與前綫的抗敵兄弟們互通聲氣，更是前例俱在，那么，捐歡運動使豐可以停止！我們所要表示者，則正是有限的在前綫的兄弟們之外，他們的背後還站有舉國一致的民衆，而前綫和後方，並且已密切的攜起手米！”現在胡毅昂先生更提出兩點寳貴的意見，因發表於下：</p>
<p>（上路）</p>
<p>㊀輸財易為輸物第一個彎通的辦法，我以為把“捐款運動”易為“捐物運動”，就是後方民衆本是拿“金錢”來慰勞前綫將士的，呵調換以“物件”來接濟前綫將士，似乎此較適宜。譬如前綫缺乏一種防毒工具，我們就可拿出願捐的金錢購防毒工具：又如前綫需要藥品或食物的話，我們也可隨時踴躍購備大批應用藥品或食物：不過為了免除供求不平衡起見，我們一而儘可容納各方民衆自動購捐任何物品（限於行軍需用的）。輸濟：一面却該由當地公共團體聯合組織一個類似“各界民衆输物勞軍運動委員會”的辦事處，担任的職務是隨時興前綫亙通聲訊，探訪什麼東西才合需要？並知其需要量若干？然後用各種方法報告後方民衆，尅日購捐此項應需物品，彚集輸運前綫。同時，如欲使採購便利實惠，仍可維持捐款辦法，祇須將所有捐款躉購各項前綫所需求的物品便了：那麼，後方民衆直接輸捐的雖仍是“金錢”，可是達劉前縫享用的已是適要的“物品”了。</p>
<p>㊁捐款的保管與支配第二個可行的辦法，便是捐款運動並不中止時，果如上述的祇須將金錢易購物品卽可：不過，這只是一部分捐款的用途。我們知道任何戰事的廷長或是擴大，軍隊裏所需要的决不是僅僅屬於物品方面的，照過去的經麼，如傷亡官兵的醫治興埋葬，死亡官兵家屬的善後，組織救護隊，組織民衆軍事運輸隊，無一非後方民衆應分負的職責也：無一非金錢才克有濟的。因此，各方捐款的保管以及支配，應少不了經過當地公團興前綫軍隊各派人員合祖一可靠的辦公委員會，來僅愼公正地處理各種念切待辦的事務，然後旣得避免“捐款不能直達下級士兵等”無謂煩言，兼可卸却因“慰勞金”保管支配的失當所產生下來的意外流弊。</p>
<p>附帶提一下的，卽已遭二十九軍退回的慰勞捐款，我們可參照上述兩個辦法擇一處理之。</p>
<h3>打鐵爐旁</h3>
<p>— 田舍</p>
<p>那輩鐵匠眞守約，一到裁秧上岸，便會如期而至。交“小暑”的那天他們就到了，一夥兒七八個。爐子，鐵墩，風箱，布蓬，大大小小的鐵錘，這點傢伙跟着他們不知開過多少碼頭，走過多少旅程，日曬夜露，經過狂風暴雨的襲擊。但是，它們正和它們的主人一樣，並沒有顯出半點頹唐，萎頓，疲憊的神態，七八個鐵匠的結實的身體，硬栗子肉的胳膊，闊胸脯，濃眉毛，有神的眼鳥珠，充含着一種沉着的力量，那廳大的爐子，爐子上的大福字，那沉重的鐵錘，鐵錘上被磨擦得光滑的粗木柄，都在在給予人以力的感應，我站在廠應門口，目送他們和它們進了祠堂屋。</p>
<p>祠堂屋裏又熱鬧起來了，村上的男女都想從這夥一年一度來的行旅者的嘴裏探知一點外碼頭的情况，新聞，尤其歡迎聽到一點關於××鬼子的消息，以為他們都是北方人，消息一定多而可靠。大家都高典捧着粥飯碗圍在打鐵爐旁，一邊吃，一邊聽，有機會便插幾句嘴。起先總是講交易，問價錢，大家都嫌今年的種田傢伙貴，一件四刺鋤頭要化五六角大洋，可從來沒有過，“唉，豆餅肥料不說，連鐵器傢伙亦這樣飛漲，種田眞難望有出息……”都這樣嘆息超來。</p>
<p>鐵匠老闆王老五就是那樣爽直的脾氣：“你們可別說我老五心黑，不夠交情，再怎樣漲價也輪不到我發財，××鬼子懷着鬼胎搗蛋，到處派人收買銅鐵，連憫鋇舊鐵也要，出大價儘收……</p>
<p>不懂事的三太婆插嘴問：“他們要許多鐵去打什麼傢伙？難道他們種田也用鐵釘耙，鐵鋤，鐮刀？”</p>
<p>……那裏的話！他們全拿去造大砲炸彈的啊。經他們一收貝，鐵價陡的貴啦，不是我抬着頭討價，成本吃重有什麼辦法，做虧本生意嗎？我可不該兩個老婆嘿嘿嘿……”</p>
<p>這些話引得大家哄的笑起來了。笑聲沒了的時挨，三房裏的連腮鬍子老龍背倚着牆門欄，一本正經的說：“中國人這樣沒志氣，把鐵賣給xx鬼子，呌他們造了槍砲來殺我們，來轟我們的城，房子，不是我老龍嘴硬，××鬼子就是用金予來換我的舊鐵器，也準呌他沒面子走路。“他揚一揚拳頭，</p>
<p>他正跨在長櫈上剷刀片的大冬瓜掉過臉來望望老龍：“××鬼子沒像你這樣老誠，會親自出來收鐵嗎，自有那些閉着眼睛吞砒霜，沒天良的東西跟他們出力，他們眼睛裏只有亮活活的臭錢，沒有祖宗，沒有子孫，到處做奸細，人家幹不出的他都幹，別說帮x×鬼子收買鐵，他們還要反過瞼來殺自己中國人呢，你想，呌人怎樣防備，好比我是奸細，到這地方來打路錢，誰知道！”</p>
<p>“你要是奷細，媽的，我早就把你打個扁！”那個長頸根鐵匠掮起大鐵錘猛的在打鐵的鐵教上空搥了一下，鐵興鐵捶聲，爆出粒粒火星，長頸根鐵匠咬牙切齒，像眞在打奸細，那副形狀又引起大家的哄笑。大冬瓜這時成了衆矢之的，眞成了一個奸細似的，有的伸手去拍他光禿的腦袋：“我們大家來打奸細啊！”連孩子也興奮地凑攏來。</p>
<p>“這可眞不是開玩笑的事，中國人要過直頭日子，就非把××鬼子逐走，把奸細打死不可，他們有好砲火，傢伙厲害，見了大刀隊就嚇掉三魂六魄，眞沒種，下跑求饒命這醜態呌入見了惡心，這時勢打鐵器傢伙也沒生路，倒不如索性打大刀，讓大兵多殺幾個××鬼了，呌他們知道中國人不是弱種還怕死嗎，要出頭，就得拚命！”王老五越說越有勁，噴着涎沫，打鐵爐裏熔熔的烈火，熙耀着他全身結實的結肌肉，發出力的光輝，我幾乎被感動得要狂呌起來。</p>

<h3>Our Side Complies with Agreement to Withdraw Troops, Japanese Positions Do Not Move</h3>
<p>Instead, a Large Quantity of Military Supplies is Transported to the Front Lines; How the Future Will Unfold is Difficult to Judge</p>
<p>[Beiping] After China and Japan decided that both sides would withdraw troops on the morning of the 21st, the Japanese troops in the Lugouqiao, Wulidian, and Dajingcun areas should have withdrawn simultaneously. However, as of 6 PM on the 22nd, the Japanese troops showed no sign of withdrawal. They even increased the number of large and small cannons by more than twenty. A large quantity of poisonous gas was also transported to the area east of Lugouqiao. Given this situation, the future is unpredictable. (Urgent telegram from this newspaper, 1 AM on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Regarding the troop withdrawal situation at the front lines, no further reports have been received as of 6 PM this afternoon. Our special correspondent has also not returned to the city. However, it is heard that the Japanese troops have not moved from their front-line positions, and only the number of personnel in various locations has been slightly reduced. Therefore, it is still difficult to immediately determine how the future will unfold. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] This morning, the reporter intended to drive out of Zhangyimen to Lugouqiao City to inspect the aftermath of the battle, due to the withdrawal of troops by both sides at the front lines. However, when arriving at the city gate, the guarding soldiers warned that most of the Japanese troops were still in the Dajingcun area, making passage difficult. They strongly discouraged going there, so the reporter returned in disappointment. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] According to reliable information from relevant sources here, the intention of the highest authorities in North China is to avoid conflict for the time being and first achieve the goal of troop withdrawal by both sides. Future negotiations will be handled through diplomatic channels between the Chinese and Japanese governments to seek a satisfactory resolution. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to a telegram from Beiping, the mutual withdrawal of one or two li by both sides on the banks of the Lugouqiao, Wanping, and Sanggan Rivers is intended to avoid the effective firing range of both sides' rifle mechanisms. It is only the first step in a ceasefire. There is still some distance to go before overall negotiation and peace. It would be a mistake to consider it one of the terms of the agreement. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Japanese military officer Imai visited Tang Erhe today. According to his statement, the Japanese troops have decided to withdraw successively and hope for a peaceful resolution.

<p>[Beiping] Half a month has passed since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. Our authorities have consistently expressed a desire for peace and on the 21st, first moved the garrison troops in that area, filling the defense with Shi Yousan's troops. The Japanese troops also expressed their willingness to withdraw. The troop movement situation on the 22nd is as follows: 1. As of 5 PM on the 22nd, only a small number of infantry remained at the culvert area of the Pinghan Railway, and the main force retreated towards Fengtai. 2. The Japanese troops in the Dawayao and Guozhuangzi area moved towards Wulidian. 3. More than one hundred artillerymen of the Japanese troops in the Dajingcun area, carrying more than ten field guns, had already moved towards Fengtai on the morning of the 22nd. Chinese and Japanese troops have begun to withdraw, and all issues will be discussed at length. However, the Japanese troops stationed in the Dawayao area bombarded our army's defense area with artillery at 1:50 AM on the 22nd, with more than ten shells landing. Our side did not retaliate. Subsequently, Zhou Yongye and others, who were monitoring the troop withdrawal, questioned the Japanese troops. They replied that it was artillery cover during the withdrawal and not an attack on the Chinese side. The artillery fire then stopped immediately. At around 1 PM, heavy artillery fire came again from the Japanese defense area in Wulidian, a total of three rounds. After negotiation, the response was the same as before. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Official news: The authorities are urgently seeking to restore traffic on the Pinghan Railway. On the 21st, they discussed with the Japanese side to simultaneously move the troops on both sides along the railway to the left and right of Lugouqiao.

It is heard that this retreat by the Japanese troops will be carried out in two steps. The first step is to withdraw from the railway line to places such as Dajingcun, Xiaojingcun, and Guozhuangzi. The second step is to continue to withdraw towards Fengtai for concentration. Zhou Yongye, Zhou Sijing, Nakajima, and Sakurai, the monitors of troop withdrawal from both sides, are still handling everything at the front.

<h3>A Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat Took Place at Yamenkou Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Starting at 2 AM on the 22nd, Japanese troops from Dajingcun, Wulidian, and other places suddenly launched a fierce attack on our Yamenkou position with heavy machine guns. Our army resisted bravely. At 2:30 AM, more than one hundred Japanese troops attacked our position again. Our broadsword team also rose up to resist, and a very fierce hand-to-hand combat took place on a small earth hill southeast of Yamenkou. In less than ten minutes, the Japanese troops were defeated and retreated. Moreover, most of the Japanese troops who attacked us on the morning of the 22nd have now concentrated in Dajingcun, Xiaojingcun, Wulidian, and other places. Only about twenty people took cross-country vehicles to Fengtai. The rest have not withdrawn. Currently, the supplies for the Japanese troops in Lugouqiao and other places are still made into rice balls by Japanese prostitutes in Fengtai and transported to the Japanese troop positions. There are a total of four defense lines of Japanese troops near Lugouqiao. Last night, the Japanese troops only withdrew the infantry of the first line to the second line. Except for some of the Japanese soldiers near the railway who have withdrawn to Fengtai, the Japanese troops in the other defense lines have not moved. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Tensions in the North China situation have lasted for two weeks. Now that the Chinese and Japanese troops in the Wanping District have withdrawn, people's hearts have begun to settle down. The possibility of continued conflict between the two sides will be reduced as a result. The troop withdrawal matters of both sides will be jointly supervised and implemented by the Chinese and Japanese military committees in accordance with the agreement. The withdrawing Chinese troops are the 37th Division. The troops of that division stationed in Lugouqiao, Babao Mountain, Xiyuan, and Beiping are now all moved to various locations west of the Yongding River. The Japanese troops have withdrawn from the vicinity of Wanping to locations closer to Fengtai. The areas vacated by the withdrawal of the 37th Division are being filled by troops of the 132nd Division, which arrived from Hejian this morning. The troops of the 37th Division stationed in Beiping will be completely withdrawn by 3 PM this afternoon, boarding trains and heading to a certain location south of Baoding. Those stationed in Wanping were supposed to withdraw last night, but there was a temporary setback because the Japanese side initially agreed that they would withdraw to Xiyuan, but later changed it to withdrawing to the west of the Yongding River. The troops refused to comply and returned to their original positions, starting to dig trenches, causing tension to return to Beiping. But by this morning, everything had been compromised. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] It is now learned that the 37th Division has accepted the plan to move to the west side of the Yongding River, and several detachments have already withdrawn to the north of Wanping. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Wachi Flies to Tokyo to Report the Current Situation</h3>

<h3>The Japanese Side Believes that a Full-Scale Conflict Can Be Avoided</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] At 8 PM on the night of the 21st, news was received that the 37th Division of Feng Zhian's troops in the Babaoshan area had not yet withdrawn, and the situation became tense again for a time. Later, a report was received that they had withdrawn to Huangsi on the night of the 21st, and it was then felt here that a full-scale conflict could be avoided. The editorials of various newspapers on the morning of the 22nd are generally as follows: The Asahi Shimbun said that if the details of the agreement on the night of the 19th are fully implemented, the scope of the problem can be reduced. For the sake of China and Japan, nothing is more gratifying than this. What remains are only the two issues of Nanjing not recognizing the agreement and the central army moving north. Japan has a definite goal, and a final resolution seems to be approaching gradually, which is truly fortunate. The Nichinichi Shimbun still advocates that the roots of the expanded state of affairs should be eliminated in one fell swoop. (Telegram from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Secret Observation of Lugouqiao and Wanping</h3>

The defense is unusually solid. When the Japanese army shelled Lugouqiao on the night of the 20th, nine shells landed in the local city, injuring four people and killing one young girl. People's hearts are still calm. Wanping Commissioner Wang Lengzhai and Secretary Hong Dazhong have been traveling between Lugouqiao and Changxindian since the 20th, handling rear affairs.

<h3>Feng Yuxiang Expresses His Opinion on the Lugouqiao Incident</h3>
<p>The Entire Military and People of the Country Should Unite as One and Fight Resolutely for National Survival</p>
<p>[Guling] Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the reporter for the Central News Agency has long wanted to visit Vice Chairman Feng to listen to his opinions. Because Feng was busy with official duties, he was only able to speak freely on the 21st. Feng was energetic and stern, and he answered all inquiries earnestly. (The following is the reporter's question and Feng's answer.) (Q) What is Vice Chairman Feng's observation of the Japanese army's behavior this time? (A) The occurrence of the Lugouqiao Incident is by no means accidental. Some Japanese soldiers are fond of success and eager for credit, which is also one of the reasons for this challenge. Seeing the victory without a fight in the three northeastern provinces, they are enthusiastic about getting promoted as easily as picking up mustard seeds. Therefore, they want to repeat the old trick of September 18th in North China, forgetting the ancient training of deploying troops under strong city walls. Those who will not win will be angry and swarm like ants, killing one-third of the soldiers, but the city will not be supported. This is the disaster of attacking. I believe that there are many wise people among the Japanese people, and there are also many enlightened people in the Japanese government. If they quickly and thoroughly abandon their policy of aggression, it is still not too late to mend the fence. Otherwise, following the minority of rash people and continuing to mobilize troops and expand the situation will not only destroy the peace of East Asia and the world, but also suffer irreparable consequences themselves. (Q) What does Vice Chairman Feng know about the process of the Lugouqiao resistance? (A) As far as I know about the incident, it was not the 29th Army that provoked it. Instead, the Japanese side used the name of illegal exercises to complete their preparations for attack and then used the excuse of a missing soldier to launch a fierce attack on Lugouqiao and Wanping City, attempting to occupy them in one fell swoop to control Beiping. At that time, the soldiers guarding Lugouqiao were only a company, while the enemy concentrated three companies, artillery, and machine guns on Lugouqiao and bombarded it, causing the officers and soldiers who desperately guarded the bridge to make a tragic sacrifice. Only four of those who did not die. Our army guarding Wanping City only a part of the antique style Wenhong Regiment to speak of resisting and to recapture Lugouqiao, and then organized a commando team, using night attacks, killed and injured many enemy soldiers. In total, our casualties reached two to three hundred people, but the losses of the invaders should be greater than this. After learning the news of the war, I immediately telegraphed to the generals of the 29th Army, saying, "You are revolutionary soldiers and have the responsibility of resisting the enemy and defending the territory. You must not allow the slightest retreat in order to protect the glorious history of thousands of years. I deeply believe that the 29th Army and the people of North China are preparing to continue to make more courageous struggles and greater sacrifices to defend the country." (Q) What is Vice Chairman Feng's observation of the future of this matter? (A) The future of this matter depends entirely on whether Japan has any repentance. Our country certainly hopes for peace, but we cannot tolerate the continuation and expansion of the state of aggression, because the independence and freedom of the country are what the whole country, from top to bottom, is willing to sacrifice everything to achieve. But the officials, soldiers and civilians of North China have endured humiliation and borne heavy burdens for several years now. Their loyalty and courage are educated and historically sound, and their unanimous belief in saving the country cannot be easily abandoned. Regarding the attitude that our country's military and civilians should have, I have seen the chairman's conversation, so I will not repeat it. The entire military and people of the country should unite as one, be neither afraid nor proud, be loyal and courageous, contribute all their strength in their respective positions, and under the unified leadership of the government, resolutely fight for national survival and national recovery.

I have recorded them as follows. According to the visitor, since the Lugouqiao Incident, the Japanese side has been using every means to control speech and news. All newspapers are not allowed to publish freely. The controlling agency is the news section of the Japanese Army Ministry. The policy of control is that, except for news directly or indirectly released by the North China Garrison Army, the Kwantung Army, and the Army Ministry, no other news may be published. Important statements, declarations, or protest documents from China are even less likely to appear in Japanese newspapers. The purpose of the control is nothing more than to consistently propagate that China is provoking, that the Chinese army is large, that anti-Japanese sentiment is intense, and that China should bear full responsibility for this incident. The scope of control is not limited to newspapers. Even in films, during screenings, short, stimulating clips or slogans about the war are inserted every few scenes, in the hope of arousing the public's war sentiment and serving as a support for the military. As for Chinese students studying in Japan, especially those who are good at writing, they are often summoned by the police for questioning without any reason, and sometimes they are secretly followed by the police. Near the Chinese embassy, there are more than ten plainclothes and uniformed police officers, and two cars are parked there. Visitors to the embassy are thoroughly questioned by these police officers about their names, addresses, occupations, and the purpose of their visit, etc., which is extremely troublesome. If embassy staff go out, the cars parked near the embassy will follow closely behind, ostensibly for protection, but in reality, it is surveillance. This obliteration of the dignity and privileges of diplomats is truly an unprecedented example in the world. For example, Chen Bosheng, a reporter stationed in Tokyo for the Central News Agency, lives on the fifth floor of a certain building, and there are four police officers guarding his door. There is also a car ready to follow and investigate when Chen goes out. Visitors to Chen's residence are also subject to detailed inquiries. The atmosphere of preventing and排斥 China is so intense that overseas Chinese in Japan inevitably suffer insults from gangsters. Even Chinese female students passing through Ginza in Tokyo are subjected to such humiliations, and the police turn a blind eye. Chinese students are also unable to concentrate on their studies due to the harsh environment, and more than a thousand have returned to China one after another. One hundred and forty people returned on the American ship at the same time as me. The Japanese side's treatment of our country's diplomats and overseas Chinese in Japan is as strict as described above. On the other hand, our country's treatment of Japanese embassy staff, Japanese residents in China, and newspaper reporters is still completely free, no different from the past. This mutual contrast cannot but make people feel infinitely sigh. (Central News Agency telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>General Mobilization of the Press</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>At this time when the entire nation is launching a war of resistance against the enemy to save the country, it is time for a full general mobilization of the righteous press. That country which invades our territory and massacres our compatriots, its national newspapers are vigorously inspiring morale. We, the victimized people, can we lack the impassioned cries, the indignant roars? To charge and kill the enemy, to sacrifice generously, are the constant and foremost tasks of the military and the people. To arouse military spirit and inspire popular morale are the constant and foremost tasks of the press. In this extraordinary period, the government and the press should have extraordinary cooperation and effort, to expose malpractices and make contributions.</p>
<p>First, the national press should immediately have a close-knit organization. Based on the most pressing needs of the current national dispute, determine the common direction of work and specific implementation methods. With the enemy's blade at our chest and the enemy's sword at our head, at a time when there is no time to save oneself, the press should unanimously be the backing of the anti-enemy government. The government should provide the press with full convenience. However, under the current situation, the lack of organization in the press leads to different paths and small power. If the government wants to implement control, it is often overwhelmed, and the efficiency is not obvious. Instead, it is better to overcorrect and deviate from the original intention. To achieve effective control, it is better for the press to have its own organization and self-control. The principles and directions of control can be based on the government's intentions, and the press can be responsible for implementation and operation. In this way, internally, it can express the unanimous spirit of the entire nation against the enemy; externally, it can represent public opinion and show the world the perseverance and determination of the Chinese nation with lively speech.</p>
<p>Second, the conditions for the press to have power and vitality are freedom of information. A healthy public opinion comes from correct understanding, and correct understanding comes from true records. Groundless talk and numb indifference are due to ignorance of the actual situation. Accurate information is the basis for sound judgment. During the Lushan Talks, Mr. Zhang Zhirang proposed that the government should quickly improve freedom of speech and news censorship. We firmly believe that today's government does not fail to value free speech. Censoring news is an unavoidable measure because blind speech is more harmful than no speech, and baseless records are more dangerous than no records. However, censorship often takes the elimination of falsehood as the standard, preventing accurate information from reaching the public. The public can then recognize the current crisis and generate passionate feelings and patriotic actions. If certain information, such as military actions or diplomatic secrets, would be harmful to national interests if disclosed, the responsible press organizations should be informed. Although not published, if the press understands the real situation, its opinions will be more in line with current needs and will not be irrelevant.</p>
<p>Third, in order to safeguard the interests of the nation, the news control network should be as comprehensive as possible. The national press and the government should strictly prevent and crack down on foreign reporters and news agencies that create rumors. At this extraordinary time, international attention should be purely correct. Currently, the communications agencies, correspondents, and newspapers of Japan in China are full of malice, and those of Britain and the United States often exaggerate and make strange claims. Therefore, we should always find ways to prevent foreigners from using concessions and consular jurisdiction to roam outside the censorship network. We should also use the full power of the government and the people to crack down on or exclude foreign newspapers that spread rumors. For example, we can fundamentally refuse to publish absurd enemy communications agency drafts. Newspapers that harm our country's interests can be subject to postal suspension. On all these points, domestic newspapers should assist the government and work together.</p>
<p>This North China Incident is not comparable to a local event. From Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to peddlers, the entire nation is determined to rather die than surrender. We will never allow the Tanggu Agreement or the He-Umezu Agreement to be produced again today. We will never allow the tragedies of the January 28th Incident and the September 18th Incident to be re-enacted. We will no longer allow the generals guarding the three sides to be deceived by the smoke screen of peace negotiations and open the door to welcome thieves. The general mobilization of the nation's military strength, material resources, and human resources has begun, and the general mobilization of public opinion is the responsibility of the press. Provide facts so that the public can understand. Provide opinions so that the public can act. Observe clearly and be the eyes and ears of the people. Shout loudly and be the voice of the people. Otherwise, this great Chinese nation will inevitably perish in a daze and be destroyed silently. Future generations will not forgive us.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Dispute Affects the European Situation; Britain, France, and the United States Conduct New Contacts</h3>
<p>Eden Declares the Obligations Stipulated by the Nine-Power Treaty; German Ambassador Assures the United States of Non-Interference in Sino-Japanese Affairs</p>
<p>[London] According to information from the Daily Telegraph, the meeting between British Foreign Secretary Eden and the French Ambassador yesterday afternoon was about the talks with Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi and Japanese Ambassador in the morning. Both Eden and the ambassador believed that the North China incident had reached a stage worthy of European concern and agreed to conduct new negotiations with the United States to discuss what steps to take to prevent the Far East incident from escalating further. (National Maritime Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>[London] It is learned today that Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Guo Taiqi, has requested the UK to initiate mediation in the Sino-Japanese dispute in North China. Members of the House of Commons also questioned Foreign Secretary Eden today as to whether the actions of the Japanese army in North China were considered an act of aggression. The Foreign Secretary avoided answering. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently met separately with the Chinese and Japanese ambassadors to the United States. The two ambassadors informed Hull of the latest news regarding the situation in China. Afterwards, Hull told the press that the situation in North China had not produced any new elements.

<p>[Washington] Republican Congressman Fish today strongly advocated in the House of Representatives that the United States withdraw all gunboats stationed in China and the army stationed in Tianjin. Fish said that if war breaks out between China and Japan, the United States should not be drawn into the vortex due to this outdated policy of stationing troops in other countries. Therefore, it is time to withdraw troops and abandon extraterritoriality. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>[London] British Foreign Minister Eden stated in the House of Commons today in response to a question from Delegate Bevan regarding the North China issue that, except for Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty, which can be considered binding, Britain is not bound by any obligations under the treaty or the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the League of Nations Covenant does not impose any obligations on Britain. Bevan asked, "Is it not a military aggression when a large number of troops from a foreign country act freely within the territory of a friendly country?" Eden refused to answer. (Central News Agency Reuters Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>[London] The cabinet held a meeting this morning specifically to discuss the Far East situation. Subsequently, news was received from the Chinese side that the Sino-Japanese dispute had eased, and government officials were very satisfied, but were generally afraid that it might become tense again in the future. Official sources also said that the British government is currently maintaining close contact with the governments of France and the United States. Foreign Minister Eden also met with French Ambassador Corbin today to discuss the Far East situation. (Central News Agency Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden issued a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon regarding the dispute between China and Japan, stating that (if the current situation in North China remains unchanged, the British government will consider it inappropriate to engage in bilateral cooperation talks with Japan, and I have reluctantly informed the Japanese government of this view). Foreign Minister Eden subsequently met with Japanese Ambassador Yoshida and confirmed the statement he made in the House of Commons. It is reported that Eden insisted that Japan's attitude towards China was too strong and could harm the relationship between Britain and Japan. Therefore, the British government hopes that the dispute between Britain and Japan can be resolved through compromise. In addition, political figures said that Japanese Ambassador Yoshida assured Eden that Japan could not accept foreign mediation in the dispute between China and Japan. In addition, Foreign Secretary Eden's statement in the House of Commons this afternoon also stated, "As far as the current North China dispute is concerned, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Paris Peace Pact do not stipulate that the British government has any kind of obligation, if any, it is only the article stipulated in Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty that the contracting countries should consult each other." Such an environment has now occurred. "A full and candid exchange of opinions" is now almost possible. (Central News Agency Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>[London] Muto Jukuro, head of the Japanese economic delegation, delivered a speech at the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, hoping that peace in the Far East would not be hindered. He said, "For the sake of trade prosperity, we must have lasting peace. If peace is destroyed again, the adverse impact on trade will certainly be greater than this." He continued, Japan hopes that all tariff barriers that hinder Japanese trade will be lifted, and finally asked that the living standards of Japanese workers be improved day by day. "I believe that what Japanese workers currently regard as luxury goods will be regarded as necessities in the future." (Central News Agency Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>[Washington] German Ambassador to the United States Dieckhoff met today with Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary Welles to discuss international issues regarding the Far East situation. Although the three did not express anything after the meeting, according to reliable sources, Ambassador Dieckhoff assured the United States that Germany would not interfere in the dispute in the Far East and hoped that other countries would do the same, fearing that the war in the Far East might lead to a world war. It is reported that Hull welcomed Germany's "non-interference" policy, as this is the first time in recent years that Germany has been able to adopt the same attitude as the United States towards international crises. Before meeting with the German ambassador, Chinese Ambassador Wang Zhengting and Japanese Ambassador Saito also visited one after another to exchange the latest information on the Far East. Hull told reporters that the United States is paying close attention to the situation in all aspects and will do its best to help preserve peace if there is an opportunity. Other than that, there are no other developments. At the same time, it was officially announced here that the commander of the Japanese Embassy guard had formally apologized to the commander of the US Embassy guard for the incident on Tuesday in Beiping in which Japanese soldiers insulted an American woman. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin The Berlin Stock Exchange News commented on the Far East situation today, stating that some foreigners always believe that any incident that disturbs world peace must have a German conspiracy behind it. In fact, Germany only has purely commercial and legitimate purposes in the Far East and sincerely hopes that both China and Japan, which are friendly countries of Germany, will maintain peace. This has no other aspirations. As for the Anti-Communist Agreement between Japan and Germany, it is a completely separate matter. (Central News Agency Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<h3>London Times Says Japan's Actions Are Unjustified</h3>
<p>A War's Outcome Holds No Profit; Even Localized Aggression Will Be Hit</p>
<p>[London] The London Times carried an editorial today stating that there are still three ways to resolve the conflict between China and Japan. The first is peaceful mediation, which is not impossible. The others are a fully armed war or localized military aggression. "Japan is free to choose between a major war and a minor conflict, or between tragedy and anticlimax." The newspaper added, "If Japan goes to war with China, it is best to immediately and decisively defeat the Chinese army, but this is impossible. Japan's invasion of China is also unjustified and an unprofitable attempt, because Japan's economic interests in North China are now in a precarious position. Thereafter, once war breaks out, even if it is only a localized aggression, it will be severely hit." The Times concluded, "Japan's military aggression in North China has no military, political, or economic goals that can be achieved." (Central News Agency Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>[London] The Times commented on the dispute between China and Japan, saying that Japan's attitude is at risk of losing British sympathy. "Japan has expanded a small mistake into an international crisis. Not only is the whole world surprised by it, but Japan itself is also confused. Moreover, the country should at least bear part of the responsibility for this mistake. What is the reason for this is impossible to grasp. The Chinese army is said to have acted to defend the country, and Japan is telling the world that these are all provocative actions. Countries around the world are not moved by it. Even Germany, which is difficult to form an anti-communist agreement with Japan, does not pay attention to the actions of its sister country in its newspapers. Although Britain has been paying attention to various issues in Japan with a sympathetic attitude, it is difficult to give sympathy because Japan is too nostalgic for one of the biggest problems, namely war." (Central News Agency Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Kobe British Newspaper Upholds Just Discourse</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Japan Chronicle, published in Kobe, is run by British people and usually holds fair opinions. On the 14th and 15th of this month, the newspaper had editorials on the Lugouqiao Incident, which were quite insightful. We have specially excerpted and translated them below to show the general opinion of foreigners living in Japan. The editorial on the 14th first said that the news lately has been very depressing. No news is often not good news. However, since the Chinese side has no determination to attack the Japanese army in Pingjin, it can at least be speculated that it intends to resolve the situation locally. It is very willing to accept a compromise, but unfortunately, the Japanese government has failed to clearly state its true intentions. The editorial pointed out that Japan's current choices are a real war or to reach peace through negotiations, and there is no other way. The current situation is completely different from five years ago. Five years ago, the Manchurian War spread south of the Great Wall, and there was still the Tanggu Agreement to establish a demilitarized zone to stop the war. However, judging from the current mood of the Chinese government and people, it is impossible for Japan to stop military action after expelling the 29th Army from the borders of Hebei and Chahar and other places in North China. Japan can certainly use its superior military force to inflict a major blow on the resistance in North China, but this may only be the beginning of a major war, not the end of a major war. Given China's vastness, can it be completely turned into scorched earth in a matter of days? Moreover, Japan's interests are not limited to North China. If Hankou, Shanghai, and other places also need protection, then from a purely military standpoint, there will be insurmountable difficulties. Furthermore, international disputes will inevitably arise at that time. How will that be handled? The press seems to have not paid attention to this, but the government must have paid serious attention to this, no doubt. The United States and other countries have already paid serious attention to this. The development of the situation must depend on the actions of the Nanjing government in the future, but the real decision still lies with Japan. The editorial on the 15th suggested that countries should mediate according to the Nine-Power Treaty, stating that if the League of Nations still had credibility, the resolution of this crisis in North China would be very simple. Unfortunately, the League of Nations has lost its credibility after the Manchurian Incident, the Xia Gu Incident, and the Italo-Ethiopian War, so it is unable to help with this incident. However, this matter is not without room for reconciliation. The Nine-Power Treaty seems to be still applicable. This incident in North China is completely different from the Manchurian Incident in 1931. First, there is no doubt about the legal status of North China, although the Hebei-Chahar Political Council has been established. North China has always been an integral part of the Republic of China. As for whether the authority of the central government in Hebei and Chahar has reached the level desired by Nanjing since the Tanggu Agreement, it is not important. Second, the Tokyo government has no intention of treating the current conflict in Pingjin as equivalent to the Manchurian Incident in 1931. The commentary continued that Japan still has resentment towards the League of Nations' handling of the Manchurian Incident, and the major powers also have many unpleasant memories of past diplomacy. It is dangerous for China and Japan to negotiate directly, and it is difficult for countries to jointly mediate. However, although countries cannot jointly mediate, they do not necessarily have to believe that loyal advice will be effective. But this is the safest way to help the Japanese government stop its actions in North China. Moreover, Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty stipulates that when any contracting country believes that circumstances to which the treaty applies have arisen, "the contracting countries shall fully and candidly exchange views with each other." Such an environment has now occurred, and "a full and candid exchange of views" is now almost possible. (Central News Agency Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<h3>French Finance Minister Bonnet Explains Financial Management Steps</h3>
<p>Saving 2.3 Billion Francs, Balancing Next Year's Budget</p>
<p>[Paris] According to reliable sources, the government has decided to reduce expenditures to alleviate the burden on the national treasury, with a total savings of 23,000,000,000 francs. Of this, the provisional budget will be reduced by 16,000,000,000 francs, railway expenditures will be reduced by 5,000,000,000 francs, and the remaining 2,000,000,000 francs will be supplemented by reducing the expenses of the Colonial Department and temporarily reducing the budget deficit of the Paris Market. In addition, regular national defense expenditures will reach around 9,000,000,000 francs, an increase of 1,000,000,000 francs compared to last year. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Ministry of Finance recently issued a public announcement stating that the ministry has signed an agreement with the Bank of France. The current cash reserves of the Bank of France, which were valued at 0.049 grams of gold per franc after the first devaluation of the franc on September 26 last year, will now be revalued at 0.043 grams of gold. (The original gold content of the franc was 0.0655 grams. After the devaluation, the highest limit was 0.049 grams, and the lowest limit was 0.043 grams.) The resulting profit of over 6,000,000,000 francs will be allocated to the debt equalization fund. Furthermore, when the public debt equalization fund and the exchange rate equalization fund are closed in the future, all unused portions will be used to repay the loans from the Bank of France to the government. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>[Paris] Finance Minister Bonnet recently made a speech explaining the process of financial reorganization, stating that it is divided into three stages: ⑴ balancing the regular budget, ⑵ reducing provisional budget expenditures, and ⑶ establishing a French public debt equalization fund. Regarding the first item, he ordered the responsible authorities to make an accurate estimate based on a reasonable calculation to avoid accidents, and to issue substitute legal orders to save 8,000,000,000 francs, so that the 1938 budget plan is strictly balanced. Regarding the second item, the expenses for various large-scale public works, national defense expenses, railway expenses, and assistance to various provinces, cities, and towns have all been reviewed and reduced to prevent the national treasury from being overly burdened next year. In addition, the debt expenditures have also been reviewed and reduced by 16,000,000,000 to 17,000,000,000 francs. Regarding the third item, he stated that the issuing banks of European and American countries can purchase public debt in their domestic securities markets to a certain limit, or even indefinitely. In France, the public debt equalization fund does not artificially interfere with market prices, but should facilitate and regulate the circulation of public debt. As for the burden on the national treasury, he said that Central Representative Leino had estimated it to be 590,000,000,000 francs, but in reality, this number can be greatly reduced. The reasons are nothing more than the following three items: (A) National treasury income can be increased by tens of billions of francs to balance the 1938 budget plan; (B) Railway income can be increased by 2,500,000,000 francs; (C) After the adjustment of railway and highway transportation, the required expenses will also be reviewed and reduced, and the various expenditures listed in the provisional budget will also be reduced, as mentioned above. Therefore, the burden on the national treasury must be below 50,000,000,000 francs. "In short, the amount of public debt to be issued next year will be more than half less than what was estimated a few weeks ago, which can be reported to everyone."

<h3>More Than 50 Countries of Scientists Participate in the International Geological Congress</h3>
<p>Russian Representative Speaks on the Use of Science, It Should Benefit Mankind and Not be Used for Slaughter</p>
<p>[Moscow] The 17th International Geological Congress opened today at the National Conservatory of Music here. Representatives from 50 countries attended. Professor Smith of the United States delivered the opening address. Mezhlauk, Soviet Commissioner of Heavy Industry, delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the Soviet government. He then proposed to elect Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, and the honorary professors present as honorary presidents. The entire audience warmly approved. After Professor Komarov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, delivered a congratulatory speech, Vice President Gubkin stood up and delivered a speech, saying, "We deeply believe that the representatives of all countries present hold the same desire, that is, to work for world peace and unanimously hate any destruction of peace and instigation of human war. Instead of using scientific achievements to overcome nature and seek welfare for all mankind, they are used to kill each other." The Congress then elected a presidium to guide all the work, and elected Professor Gubkin as chairman, the leaders of the delegations of various countries as vice-chairmen, and Academician Gorbunov as secretary-general. Gubkin then read a report on "World Oil Reserves", which attracted extraordinary attention from the audience.</p>
<p>According to a report in the News, Gubkin's paper on world oil reserves stated that the known oil reserves in the Soviet Union currently exceed 637,600,000 tons. However, the estimate as of January 1, 1935, was only 320,800,000 tons. In recent years, Soviet geologists have not only measured that the reserves in the old oil areas are actually larger than previously estimated, but also discovered many new oil areas, such as Bashkiria, the western foothills of the northern Ural Mountains, the Volga Province, and Central Asia, which have already begun to be exploited. The preliminary geological exploration results prove that there is also a possibility of oil reserves in Chuchukstan, western and eastern Siberia, and Yakutia. The Soviet Union's oil reserves are estimated to account for 54.8% of the world's total, and the United States accounts for 25%.</p>
<p>All Soviet newspapers published news about the papers of the conference. The News specifically wrote an editorial to welcome the representatives of all countries attending the conference, and elaborated on the great progress made by the Soviet Union in geology. It stated that in the 20 years since the establishment of the Soviet regime, not only have the various mineral resources discovered in the country been correctly investigated, but also countless important mineral resources have been newly discovered in the Ural Mountains, Siberia, the Caucasus, Chuchukstan, and Yakutia. The industrial life of these new mining areas has developed vigorously, supplying metals, fuels, chemicals, and building materials to the entire country. The holding of this conference in Moscow proves the increase in the authority of the Soviet scientific community internationally. All participants in the conference are world-renowned geologists. The authority and scientific value of this conference are very high. The conclusion of the discussion of various important issues will enable the progress and development of geological science and open up new paths for mankind to overcome nature.

<h3>Soviet Report States the Arctic Ocean is Shaped Like a Bowl</h3>
<p>The Arctic Has a Strong Warm Current, Summer Climate is at Zero Degrees, Life Discovered on the Ice</p>
<p>Leningrad According to Professor Shamoilov, chief professor of the All-Union Arctic Institute, summing up the work achievements of the four people, Bapatin, Clenkel, Schulakov, and Fedorov, since they started working on the Arctic ice floes, it has been one month. Although the four warriors stationed in the North Pole have not worked for long, they have made many important discoveries about the nature of the Arctic and its vicinity. We now know how deep the ocean floor near the North Pole is, so we can recognize that the Arctic Ocean is shaped like a bowl, with its deepest point near the North Pole. Previously, we did not know where the Gulf Stream of the Atlantic Ocean flowed to the north. Now we know that there is also a strong warm current of the Atlantic Ocean near the North Pole. We originally did not know where the polar ice floes drifted. Now, after 30 days of investigation, we have learned that the ice floes are drifting to the southwest, between Spitzbergen and Greenland. In the past, we could only speculate about the climate near the North Pole. Now we know for sure that the climate there is relatively warm in the summer, with the highest temperature being 0 degrees Celsius and the lowest being minus 12 degrees Celsius. The question of whether there is life in the Arctic has also been resolved. There is indeed life on the ice, because we have found birds. Of course, there must also be life under the ice. Finally, we have determined the magnitude of the Earth's magnetic force. From this, in a very short period of time, we have already discovered many extremely important scientific achievements. The daily work results of Bapatin and the other three people have allowed us to obtain quite important discoveries. Their experience, their self-consciousness, and the talents of the two young scientists, Schulakov and Fedorov, can guarantee that all observations must be exceptionally thorough, and this kind of observation is carried out under extremely unusual conditions with great sacrifice.

<p>[Moscow] The editorial staff of the Truth newspaper in Kursk, an important provincial capital, has been arrested. It is believed that the arrested editors are accused of obstructing the government's policies. (National Maritime Telecommunications, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Central Committee of the Communist Party recently expelled Gu Lik, chairman of the Radio Broadcasting Committee of the Ukrainian Republic, from the party and dismissed him from his post. Many other officials of the committee have also been dismissed. It is said that Gu Lik was punished because he failed to eliminate the reactionary elements in the Radio Broadcasting Committee and included counter-revolutionary propaganda in the broadcasting items. According to the Communist Party's organ newspaper Truth, the Radio Broadcasting Committee of the Ukrainian Republic had been attacked several times. When Zinoviev and Kamenev were sentenced to death last year, the radio stations in the region immediately broadcast funeral marches after announcing the news, which was inappropriate.

<h3>German Submarine Peeks at British Naval Exercise</h3>
<p>Navy Corrects News</p>
<p>London Various newspapers published news saying that a British destroyer, the HMS Whirlwind, was conducting an exercise on the sea surface inside Portland Port on the 19th of this month, when a German submarine was found passing nearby. The HMS Whirlwind forced the submarine to surface. The Navy specially issued a public statement correcting the above news, saying that when the British destroyers HMS Whirlwind, HMS Walpole, and the submarine HMS Spearfish were exercising on the sea surface of Portland Port, the HMS Walpole glimpsed an unidentified submarine surfacing and sailing east. The British warships immediately stopped the exercise, and the HMS Spearfish was ordered to surface and record the number marked on the conning tower of the unidentified submarine, which was No. 34. Therefore, it was determined that the submarine was a German submarine that had sailed through the English Channel back to Germany. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding rumors that a British destroyer discovered a German submarine in the English Channel on Monday, Foreign Secretary Eden and Naval Secretary Cooper both issued statements today, strongly denying it. (National Maritime Telecommunications, 21st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Special Parliament Opens Today</h3>
<p>Emergency Situation in China, No Party Will Voice Strong Opposition</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The first 71st Special Parliament of the Kinoshita Cabinet will be convened on the 23rd amidst the dangerous situation in North China and the atmosphere of urgency. In order to prepare for various matters, the various factions of the House of Representatives have convened general meetings of their members from the 21st to the 22nd to decide on their attitude towards attending the special parliament. The various parties believe that at this time of emergency in North China, they should overcome the situation with a united national front, conduct parliamentary affairs with a spirit of cooperation, and provide strong assistance to the government. The power of the various parties in the House of Peers and the House of Representatives is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>House of Peers: Imperial Family 18, Research Society 163, Justice Society 66, Tuesday Society 42, Koyu Club 35, Dowakai 34, Doseikai 12, Independents 32, Vacancies 3, Total 397, plus 18 members of the Imperial Family.</p>

<h3>Britain Plans to Break Deadlock in Spanish Problem</h3>
<p>Eden Meets with British and Italian Ambassadors, Plans to Establish Three Committees for Discussion</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden today resumed talks with the French and Italian fire envoys to discuss the implementation procedures of the British compromise plan on non-intervention in the Spanish civil war. The British side hopes to convene a subcommittee meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee again on Friday, but the date has not been determined until the reasons for the Italian side's insistence are confirmed. If the dispute on the Italian side is of a certain nature, then the current difficulties will be difficult to break. Furthermore, the British side also expressed that its patience is not unlimited. The British side is still unable to prove whether the Italian side is willing to create a rupture over the priority of procedures, or whether it is only using it to delay the matter in order to avoid the serious juncture in the issue of withdrawing volunteer soldiers. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden separately met with the French and Italian ambassadors today to discuss the current deadlock in the non-intervention plan for the Spanish civil war. It is said that the talks did not result in any progress. The positions of the two sides are fundamentally opposed. The British and French sides maintain the original method of the British compromise plan, advocating that foreign volunteer soldiers in Spain should be withdrawn first, and then the two parties involved in the civil war should be recognized as belligerent entities. The Italian side insists on the opinions put forward by the subcommittee yesterday morning and rejects the British and French proposals. Therefore, the general public is deeply afraid that the situation will be the same as on the day of the meeting of the subcommittee of the Coordinating Committee on the 23rd of this month, and that Germany and Italy may require Britain and France to stop naval surveillance in the sea areas under the jurisdiction of the Spanish National Army. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons met today, and Liberal MP Mandel asked whether there was a deadline for the British compromise plan on non-intervention in the Spanish civil war to be submitted to the Coordinating Committee for discussion. Eden said, "The British government cannot agree to any method of delaying the discussion. This has been clearly stated by Plymouth, Chairman of the Coordinating Committee, Secretary of Foreign Affairs." (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>[London] Well-informed sources recently stated that Foreign Secretary Eden had proposed to Italian Ambassador Grandi yesterday to organize three shareholder committees: ⑴ a shareholder committee for the inspection plan for Spanish ports; ⑵ a shareholder committee for the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers from Spain; ⑶ a shareholder committee for the recognition of the two parties involved in the Spanish civil war as belligerent entities. He also advocated immediately contacting the two parties involved in the Spanish civil war. However, the attitude of the Italian government is still unknown, so the subcommittee of the Coordinating Committee may not be able to meet as scheduled tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>[London] The subcommittee of the Coordinating Committee for the non-intervention plan in the Spanish civil war appointed a technical shareholder committee yesterday to draft a plan for the inspection of Spanish ports. The shareholder committee is scheduled to meet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11 am tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Paris] French officials recently stated that the French government has not changed its original position on the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish civil war. That is, the French government is prepared to endorse any procedure that resolves the current deadlock. However, France firmly insists that the main points of the British compromise plan must be respected. Therefore, the issue of withdrawing foreign volunteer soldiers in Spain cannot be resolved one day, and the belligerent group in the civil war cannot be recognized one day. In addition, officials also criticized Italy's tough attitude, saying that when the British compromise plan was announced, Rome warmly praised it, saying it was a victory for Germany and Italy. Now Italy's position is contrary to this. How can such a contradictory situation occur? It is also possible that Italy's attitude is due to France's adoption of a compromise position. In the past, France opposed recognizing the two parties involved in the Spanish civil war as belligerent entities, believing that this would be a source of permanent international disputes. However, later France once made a concession and agreed to recognize the belligerent group in the civil war after all volunteer soldiers were withdrawn. It is also possible that Italy is taking a tough stance now because France has expressed its recognition and is taking a step forward. As for the fact that the British and French navies have implemented inspection of the sea surface in the Spanish National Army's claimed sea area, officials believe that France insists that neutral inspectors must inspect the Spanish ports in accordance with the provisions of the British compromise plan before the sea surface inspection system can be completely abolished.

<h3>The Philippines is Wary of Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>Quezon Says Independence is Not a Solution, But the US Has Not Changed its Position</p>
<p>[New York] Philippine President Quezon left here yesterday for San Francisco to take a boat back home. Before leaving, he gave an interview to the World Telegram, indirectly stating that immediate independence for the Philippines may not be the best solution to the US-Philippine problem. He hopes that the US Congress will discuss the bill during this transition period to allow the Philippines to remain under US protection. The newspaper believes that Quezon, when elected president, took complete independence for the Philippines as his political platform. This change is noteworthy. A special correspondent interviewed various senators to seek their reactions to this. Quinton, one of the proposers of the Philippine Independence Act, actually said that he did not want to express his opinion before the Mixed Committee's discussion. Only he himself is more in favor of the Philippines achieving complete independence as soon as possible. Vandenburg said that he agreed with President Quezon's statement that the current situation is unbearable. The Far East is like a powder keg. We are in the midst of it, with responsibility but no power. But today, there is no turning back. We should make the Philippines completely independent as soon as possible. The newspaper also carried a commentary saying that President Quezon's change of position is courageous and demonstrates statesmanship. Since the Japanese army invaded Manchuria on the night of September 18, 1931, creating a puppet state, the international treaties that the village issued are equal to waste paper. Philippine independence was originally expected to obtain international guarantees. Today, the military is again noisy in the fight in Beiping, which proves that collective security has become a bubble for weak countries in East Asia. The leaders of the Philippine decoration do not dare to tell the people directly about these facts, not to mention the economic issues. (National Society Telegraph, 21st)</p>

<h3>Palestine Problem, British Discussion Concludes</h3>
<p>No Immediate Definitive Resolution; Report to be Submitted to League of Nations Committee</p>
<p>[London] The British House of Commons debate on the Palestine issue has concluded. The Palestine White Paper will be submitted to the League of Nations Mandates Commission in Geneva on July 30th. (July 22nd, Kuomin News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>[London] The British House of Commons has decided to postpone a definitive resolution on the Palestine partition plan. After lengthy discussion, the House passed a motion stating that all proposals regarding Palestine contained in the White Paper should first be submitted to the League of Nations, so that the British government, after thorough investigation, may carefully examine each proposal in the White Paper and draft a comprehensive plan for submission to Parliament. This debate was initiated by Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore, who first requested the House of Lords to approve the proposal and urged all members to carefully consider their words, as the debate would be closely watched by Jews and Muslims worldwide. The Colonial Secretary stated firmly that the British government had never promised to grant the land west of the Jordan River in Palestine to the Grand Mufti. Although the independence of Arab nations had been promoted, the Balfour Declaration only promised to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine, not to make all of Palestine a Jewish state. During the European War, the British suffered tens of thousands of casualties in Palestine, and many more in Iraq. If Britain had not made these sacrifices, how could the Arab independent states have emerged in the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Transjordan, and a large part of Palestine? This is something the Arabs should recognize. Regarding the provisions of the Mandate concerning education and the promotion of self-governance, he felt that these provisions were impractical and only served to widen the gap between Arabs and Jews. The British government is well aware that the continuation of this Mandate system cannot satisfy the hopes of either the Jews or the Arabs. Only partition can realize the ideals of both sides, as both sides fundamentally distrust being ruled by the other. There is no way to remove their doubts other than partitioning Palestine. Some have argued that the Palestine problem is economic in nature or caused by administrative failures, but they do not know that both Jews and Arabs hold deep-seated nationalism. Therefore, the Palestine problem is purely political in nature and unrelated to other factors. Nationalism has now spread throughout the world. The conclusion of the French-Syrian treaty has naturally excited Arab nationalism, and the flames of killing Jews in some places have also changed the Jewish view of Palestine. Previously, they considered it their concentration point, but now they see it as a refuge. The British government believes that the White Paper contains the best policy that the British government should adopt. Therefore, it wants to first seek the opinion of the Mandates Commission before engaging in contact with Jews, Arabs, and all relevant countries to establish a future administrative policy for Palestine. Mr. Law asked whether the British government would assume the protection of any minority group in the future. The Colonial Secretary replied that it was a matter for the League of Nations, and also stated that Britain had sympathy for this report, and many Arabs also supported it, such as the Transjordan government's endorsement. He sincerely hoped that Jews and Arabs would cooperate with the British government in good faith to realize the effort to bring peace to the Holy Land. (July 22nd, Reuters via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] After the British Committee submitted a report proposing the partition of Palestine into a Jewish state, an Arab state, and a British mandated territory, the House of Commons began discussing it today. Opposition party leader Sir Archibald Sinclair spoke first, saying that he felt ashamed after reading the report. The League of Nations entrusted Britain with the mandate over Palestine, which was one of the greatest undertakings of British statesmen. Unfortunately, since 1920, British rule there has been indecisive, leading to failure, which is deeply regrettable. The British government should now seek the opinions of other countries, but it is feared that these countries will not necessarily agree with the proposals put forward by the British government. If we now abandon the task of governing Palestine, will other countries be willing to take its place? Does the House of Commons have confidence in this?” Several members of various parties spoke in succession. Among them, Conservative right-wing leader Winston Churchill proposed an amendment stating that the Committee’s report should be submitted to the League of Nations for discussion first. On the other hand, the House of Lords continued to discuss this issue today. Former Foreign Secretary Lord Reading vehemently criticized the report, stating that Palestine is one of the most delicate areas in the world. Establishing a Jewish state there is likely to lead to international disputes. The British government must not act hastily, and should organize a joint committee of the upper and lower houses to thoroughly study this matter. (July 20th, Havas News Agency)</p>

<h3>Japanese Residents in Shantou Return to Taiwan</h3>
<p>Special Agents and Registered Taiwanese Engage in Activities in the Interior of Chaozhou and Shantou; Japanese Consulate in Shantou Holds Emergency Assembly Drill</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After the Japanese army in Fengtai attacked Lugouqiao on the evening of the 8th, the Japanese Third Fleet stationed in Taiwan issued orders for the ships to mobilize that same night, dispersing to engage in activities along the coasts of Fujian and Guangdong. The speed of their actions indicates that this was planned in advance. The destroyers "Ume" and "Wakatake" entered the waters off Qilu, Shantou at 5 PM on the afternoon of the 9th, ostensibly to protect Japanese residents. Soldiers from these ships have been seen carrying heavy items back and forth between the ships and the Japanese Consulate in Shantou. Residents and members of the Japanese Association in Shantou hold meetings every night, discussing current events and reporting on the situation in the city, dispersing late at night. A secret intelligence committee has been established to assist special agents in gathering information about our military and political movements, and the sentiments of people in society regarding war and peace. Last month, a Mr. Lin led groups of special agents into the interior of Chaozhou and Shantou to carry out various activities. On the 13th, the Shantou Japanese Consulate received instructions from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, notifying Japanese residents to prepare to leave. All women and children would first return to Keelung, Taiwan to gather. A reception center has been set up in Keelung. All Japanese residents leaving the country will receive a 50% discount on transportation. Men between the ages of 25 and 35 have received conscription notices, requiring them to settle their personal affairs and dedicate themselves to the battlefield. Those who have difficulties must submit a written application to the Consulate, requesting a postponement of conscription. Taiwanese residents with fixed occupations each have a self-defense gun hidden at home, and have been organized into intelligence, transportation, medical aid, and inspection squads, each with specific duties, maintaining absolute secrecy. Since this spring, the goods in the warehouses of the trading firms operated by Taiwanese residents in this port have been largely rotted and no one cares. Countless soybean cakes and marine products have been dumped into the sea, resulting in significant losses. The businesses of these traders have essentially failed and they have long thought of closing down, but this has been forbidden by the Japanese authorities. They are occasionally rewarded for colluding with Chinese traitors to purchase tungsten ore, scrap copper and iron, old cotton quilts, fishing nets, hemp bags, miscellaneous grains, sweet potatoes, sesame, etc. from the interior and transport them back to their country as raw materials for military supplies. For this reason, these Taiwanese residents have been able to barely survive, and the Chinese traitors, having colluded with these Taiwanese residents, are also becoming increasingly active.</p>
<p>On the 18th, the Japanese ships scheduled to sail between Shantou and Taiwan were detained by the Japanese military to transport soldiers. According to rumors here, the 5th, 11th, 13th, and 16th Destroyer Squadrons could arrive from Taiwan within days to protect Japanese residents, and some marines are preparing to land in the counties of Chao'an, Dongshan, and Nan'ao on the border of Fujian and Guangdong to seize these counties as bases for the navy and air force. Also, when the "Hong Kong Maru" left Shantou on the morning of the 18th, many Japanese women and children boarded the ship to Taiwan. At 9 PM that same afternoon, Japanese Consul-General Seichi Yamasaki ordered all Japanese residents to perform an emergency assembly drill at the Japanese elementary school playground. A command platform and a wireless transceiver have been built on the corner of the school building, which can communicate with Japanese ships anchored in the port using semaphore and signal lights. There is also a lookout and signaling platform on the roof of the Japanese Consulate. When a red flag is raised, it can be seen from the ships. A whistle is blown as a signal. The transportation group personnel on shore, many of whom live by the sea, hear the whistle and immediately travel by car to relay the message to the group leaders in the city's various districts. The group leaders notify the residents in each household, and each person gathers at the four designated locations in the shortest possible time, following the routes set in advance. Marines can also completely land within thirty minutes, and the transportation group guides them to the assembly points for protection. During the assembly, everyone is fully armed, awaiting orders to advance, retreat, or safely evacuate to the warships. The medical aid team of the Taiwanese residents also follows along to provide medical assistance. All designated assembly points have sandbags prepared in advance to provide cover, and temporary artillery platforms are erected to block traffic. There are currently over 500 Taiwanese residents in Chaozhou and Shantou. Judging from the steps of their emergency assembly and the thoroughness of the arrangements, the organization of other Japanese residents is even more evident. (July 20th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate in Guangzhou Holds Meetings for Consecutive Days</h3>
<p>Japanese Residents Preparing to Leave Guangzhou</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the outbreak of war in Hebei, Japanese warships have come to Guangdong in two teams: one patrolling the coast of Shantou and Guangzhou, and the other appearing off Hainan Island. Fearing that the fleet cannot penetrate deep inland, more than sixty Taiwanese fishing boats have been sent to Hong Kong to register with the Hong Kong government. Although nominally fishing boats, their purpose is unknown, and they have already attracted great attention from the Guangdong and Hong Kong authorities. Organizations in Hong Kong have requested the Hong Kong government to strengthen police preparations to consolidate the security of the territory. Organizations in Guangdong have also petitioned the government, requesting that the Hong Kong authorities be informed not to register these fishing boats to avoid future troubles. As for the Japanese warships arriving off the coast of Guangzhou, four of them attempted to sail into the Pearl River, but after persuasion, they turned back, yet still patrol outside Humen Port. It is said that the warships' intention to sail into the Pearl River was under the pretext of protecting Japanese residents, but the Guangdong provincial government has already explicitly ordered its subordinates to provide close protection to Japanese residents.</p>
<p>On the 16th and 17th, there were rumors that Japanese residents and women and children in Shamian had packed their luggage and were leaving the country. However, according to news from Shamian yesterday, not all Japanese residents in Shamian have left Guangzhou. Those who returned to their country a few days ago were only Japanese residents who were drafted into military service. Furthermore, the Japanese Consul in Shamian has ordered Japanese merchants to refrain from entering the Chinese territory unless necessary, to avoid misunderstandings. The Japanese Consulate has been shipping items to Japan and holding meetings. New Japanese have been seen entering and leaving the consulate, and the number of telegrams sent from the Japanese Consulate to Taiwan and Tokyo has increased many times. A certain secretary at the Japanese Consulate also admitted that Japanese residents in Guangzhou had indeed prepared everything so that if the negotiations on the Hebei incident broke down, they would leave Guangzhou at any time.</p>
<p>The coastline of Qiongya and Leizhou in the southern region is very long. Japanese warship sightings have been reported, and the authorities have made considerable preparations in Qiongya to consolidate coastal defenses. (July 20th)</p>

<p>Wuxi Matricide Offender Executed by Hanging</p>
<p>Feng Qibao (also known as Chen Ziming), a carpenter in Wuxi's Caishen Lane, had an incestuous relationship with his sister, Chen Benyun. When their mother discovered and scolded them, Feng Qibao killed his mother. After the crime was discovered, Feng Qibao and Chen Benyun were arrested. The Wuxi District Court sentenced them both to death. The defendants appealed to the High Court, but the original verdict was upheld. Now that the third trial has concluded, Feng Qibao was sentenced to death, and Chen Benyun's sentence was reduced to fifteen years of imprisonment. At 7 AM on the morning of the 22nd, the High Court Prosecutor's Office sent Prosecutor Weng and police officers to the Third Branch Prison to execute Feng Qibao by hanging according to the law.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Three Japanese Warships Spotted Along the River</p>
<p>Reliable information received here from the Lao Wu Municipal Office states that three Japanese warships, two large and one small, arrived at the mouths of Hupu and Gaopu on the 21st and anchored there overnight. The two ships anchored at the mouth of Hupu lowered small boats to the shore to conduct surveying operations. Our armed forces stationed at the river mouth are taking strict precautions. The ships did not sail upstream until 6 AM the next morning.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Dispute over Temporary Business Tax on Wheat</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the temporary business tax on wheat, the various flour mills in Wuxi and the wheat stores stationed in Wuxi from other ports have telegraphed to the relevant authorities, stating that the wheat raw material has already been subject to a unified tax. Since the business tax law has an exception provision, and the Ministry of Finance's original plan does not include an exemption method, the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department's order for wheat sellers to collect a temporary business tax fundamentally violates the tax law and cannot be responsible for its implementation. According to Article 25 of the Provisional Constitution, people have no obligation to pay taxes unless required by law. They request that the Jiangsu Finance Department be promptly stopped to comply with the law. At the same time, a letter was sent to the Chamber of Commerce to forward a letter to the Business Tax Bureau. Subsequently, an order was received stating that the Provincial Department had been instructed to investigate and verify. The Wuxi Business Tax Bureau yesterday received another order from the Finance Department stating that the temporary business tax on wheat is to be borne by the wheat sellers. The wheat sellers' sale of wheat is a business activity and they naturally have an obligation to pay taxes. They are instructed to implement this strictly. If the flour mills do not collect on their behalf, it is tantamount to not assisting, and their tax exemption passports should be revoked and shipments stopped. The Chamber of Commerce immediately forwarded a letter to the various flour mills and wheat stores stationed in Wuxi from other ports, and they will negotiate together at the Chamber of Commerce at 9 AM on the 23rd.</p>

On the night of the 16th, Jin Sheng was cooling off in a neighbor's yard. Fengqing, seeing an opportunity, went to Shen's place to have fun. Jin returned home and caught them, and full of anger, used his tanning knife to stab Ye. However, Ye was strong and instead knocked Jin down, seized the knife, and killed Jin. Then, with Shen, he wrapped the body in a quilt, tied it with a large stone, and threw it into the river.

<h3>美麗盃單打複賽張定釗敗於卡遜</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Zhang Dingzhao lost to Carson by a score of three sets to one in the semi-finals. Squia also secured a spot in the finals.</p>
<p>The Beautiful Cup tennis tournament, organized by the Kangdi Club, featured two singles matches and one doubles match yesterday. In the singles match, Carson competed against Zhang Dingzhao for the right to enter the finals. The match was originally scheduled for 4:00 PM, but Carson was late, so it was delayed until 5:00 PM. The strengths of both sides were relatively balanced, and the situation during the match was extremely tense. Carson's cannonball serves yesterday allowed him to gain the advantage. However, Zhang Dingzhao also demonstrated sufficient strength and, despite Carson's power, sometimes managed to subdue him. Zhang's main weakness lay in his weak backhand, which made it difficult for him to defend against Carson's serves. Otherwise, Carson would have been in danger. The final result was three sets to one, with Zhang Dingzhao sadly eliminated. Now, our Chinese players have no hope of winning the Beautiful Cup singles championship. In another semi-final match, Squia played against Fuchusi. Both players had similar skills, and the match was evenly matched. In the end, Squia defeated Fuchusi, who had purchased half of the match, with his powerful long strokes, thus earning the right to enter the finals with Carson. The finals date has been set for tomorrow. The two champions will meet, and it remains to be seen who will emerge victorious. In the doubles match, Shi Disheng and Cai Huitang were eliminated by Andrew Jinstibo Zhi Qiaofu's team with a score of two sets to one. The results of yesterday's match and today's schedule are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Zhang Dingzhao loses to Carson. Zhang Dingzhao wins three consecutive points on Carson's serve, raising hopes of breaking Carson's serve. However, after a moment of hesitation, Carson wins the first game. Suffering this setback, Zhang allowed Carson to win five games in a row. Except for a slight improvement in the fifth game, Zhang only scored four points in the second, third, and fourth games, demonstrating how easily Carson won. Carson wins the first set with a score of 6-1. Starting from the second set, Zhang's strength returned, and his strokes were powerful. However, Carson's momentum remained strong. After Zhang won the first game, Carson immediately evened the score with a slippery serve in the second game. Fortunately, starting from the third game, Zhang repeatedly attacked with diagonal strokes. Carson suddenly lost control of his east side, resulting in numerous errors out of bounds. Zhang easily won the second set with a score of 6-1, making it one set each. Starting from the third set, Zhang immediately broke Carson's serve and won the second game with a slippery score, creating an extremely favorable situation. However, after Carson evened the score in the third game, Zhang lost two more slippery games, allowing Carson to take the lead with a score of 3-2. After two deuces in the sixth game, Zhang finally recovered. In the seventh game, Zhang saved a seemingly impossible ball by hitting it behind Carson, taking the lead again with a score of 4-3. After a 4-4 tie, the two sides reached 5-5 and then 6-6. In the thirteenth game, Carson seized the opportunity and won the game. After leading 7-6, Carson capitalized on his luck and won the third set with a net ball, ending the set with a score of 8-6. After a brief rest, the fourth set began. Carson continued his momentum and won three consecutive games. In the fourth game, Carson made several errors out of bounds, allowing Zhang to recover and narrow the score to 2-3. Unfortunately, this good situation did not last long. Carson then intercepted several balls at the net and lost three more games, losing the fourth set with a score of 6-2. In the end, Zhang was eliminated by Carson with a score of three sets to one.</p>

<h3>一九三七年惠勃爾登網球大會（十）</h3>
<p>— By Lieshan, Our European Correspondent</p>
<p>Day Eight</p>
<p>The eighth day of Wimbledon was again a day for women's singles. Regarding the men's singles, we dare to predict that the final two will likely be Bufan and Cranm. But when it comes to women's singles, it's much more difficult. These seven 'main players' are almost all equally strong. We can't even guess who the final four will be. The results of today's matches, except for the victory of Polish Ms. Jie Shiqiaosika, which was within our expectations, the other two matches were somewhat sudden.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ma Xiu defeated Ms. Li Shana, six to three, six to two.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ma Pu'er defeated Mrs. Shi Boling, seven to five, two to six, six to three.</p>
<p>Ms. Lan Chi defeated Ms. Jie Kebobu, six to four, six to two.</p>
<p>In fact, in terms of skill, the three who lost had a chance to win. Perhaps it was due to personal health or strategic errors. But no one can explain why they lost. Everyone felt that the losses were a bit 'sudden'.</p>
<p>▲ Li Shana's defeat is a pity</p>
<p>The most miserable defeat was naturally that of Ms. Li Shana. Not only was she the most popular for this year's World Women's Tennis Championship, but it was also more sympathetic that she was in England for eighteen months, with all expenses provided by the people of Chile (a total of five thousand pounds, a national donation to help a tennis player, perhaps this is the first time in history). So after her defeat, she felt sorry for the expectations of her compatriots. She cried for a full hour in the dressing room. We can understand her sadness. She had recently gotten engaged to a Scotsman and was preparing to get married soon. But the stimulation this time was too great. She told reporters that she had discussed it with her fiancé and postponed the wedding for a year. Next year at the Wimbledon Championships, her name will still be Li Shana, a Li Shana who is always popular with the public.</p>
<p>Here, we feel that Tielerden's prediction was correct. Mrs. Ma Xiu reached the final four somewhat relying on her own skills. She is already twenty-nine years old, a mother of two children. She participates in the Wimbledon Championships every year, but has never won a championship. The hope for this year is not very high either. After she meets Ms. Lant, there are still the Polish and American champions there. Ms. Lant has not appeared on the court for two or three months. Maybe she will be an “dark horse” this year. A British newspaper said that Mrs. Ma Xiu is a rare figure on the tennis court. When she won the French Women's Singles Junior Championship, she was already a married woman. This reporter's words were a bit mean.</p>
<p>▲ Jie Kebobu loses to Lant</p>
<p>Similarly, the defeat of last year's world champion, American Ms. Jie Kebobu, also made the general public feel that Ms. Lant's skills were particularly good today, and Ms. Jie was particularly bad. In the first set, Ms. Jie once led with a score of 4-2. At this time, Ms. Lant suddenly exerted herself, and her interceptions at the net were almost always successful. Later, she was even more blessed, and even her weakest forehand stroke could be used freely at this time, and the balls she hit were just over the net, and sometimes even touched the net. As a result, she won the first set with four consecutive games.</p>
<p>In the second set, Ms. Jie Kebobu was even more depressed. Ms. Lant took advantage of the situation and lost only two games in the middle. A champion from last year left the field in such a desperate situation. Most of the audience expressed their deep sympathy for her. Judging from Ms. Lant's performance today, the hope of winning the championship is much higher. In terms of personal skills, she is the most average of the seven. Although there are no special strengths, there are no weaknesses either. She can deal with all aspects. As long as she uses her strategy properly, she can take advantage of her opponent's weaknesses and achieve the final victory.</p>
<p>▲ Ma Pu'er is like Bo Qi</p>
<p>Mrs. Ma Pu'er's victory over Mrs. Shi Boling was the most exciting scene today. Mrs. Shi Boling is the number one player in Europe. Historically, I don't know how many female tennis players have been defeated by her. Her skills are more stable than those of Ms. Lant. However, she is also a traditional tennis player, like Jing Lan Jiao 克勞福. She lost to Ms. Jie Kebobu in the final of Wimbledon last year because the opponent adopted a new strategy. Mrs. Ma Pu'er's specialties are serving and intercepting at the net. As long as she uses this weapon effectively, she can defeat any famous player. And today is another day for her to be proud. In the first set, Mrs. Shi Boling once led with a score of 5-4. At this time, Mrs. Ma Pu'er seemed to have a determination to win or lose. Her forehand stroke and interception at the net had the style of a first-class male tennis player at Wimbledon (Mrs. Ma Pu'er's hitting posture is a bit like Bo Qi). In the blink of an eye, she reversed the situation and won the first set with a score of 7-5.</p>
<p>The situation in the second set was exactly the opposite. Mrs. Ma Pu'er's old problem, the forehand stroke, revealed her weakness again. Mrs. Shi Boling won this set with a score of 6-2.</p>
<p>After the start of the third set, Mrs. Shi Boling still used the method she used in the second set, specializing in attacking the opponent's right side, with a score of 3-0. Mrs. Shi Boling took the lead. At this moment, there was a sudden turning point. Mrs. Ma Pu'er suddenly took on a desperate attitude. The weight of her forehand stroke was terrifying. After the ball was hit, she immediately went to the net. Her rapid running did not give Mrs. Shi Boling a chance to think carefully. The ball that Mrs. Shi Boling came over could not pass the net, or it was split by her, or it became a wild ball that went out of bounds. In this way, she won six consecutive games, and on the contrary, she won the final victory with a score of 6-3. If we hadn't seen it with our own eyes, we wouldn't have imagined that a female tennis player could have such skills. Mrs. Ma Pu'er is the American champion from last month. After this battle today, she feels that her 'reputation is not reliable'. She may not win the world championship this year, but there is always hope in the next few years.</p>
<p>Ms. Jie Shiqiaosika won very easily. She defeated Ms. Shi Keleiweng with a score of 6-1 and 6-2. No one in the Wimbledon women's team can compare to the Polish girl's physical strength. No one can compare to the hardness of her hitting and the weight of the ball when it lands in the opponent's area. She is one of the final four today. In the next match, she will meet Mrs. Ma Pu'er. Although, we dare not predict who will win or lose, but Mrs. Ma Pu'er will not easily have the opportunity to go to the net. If Mrs. Ma Pu'er cannot use her interception skills, perhaps she will fail.</p>
<p>The third round of the men's singles has ended. Three pairs of 'main players', as well as Mansier and Hei Qu Te's pair, have passed safely. The fourth week of the women's doubles and mixed doubles has also begun. Wimbledon is only four days away. The closer it gets to the closing, the more tense the battle situation becomes. Everyone is waiting to see who the champion of this year will be.</p>
<p>Education News</p>
<h3>汪主席對敎育問題之引論全文</h3>
<p>Full Text of Chairman Wang's Introduction to Education Issues</p>
<p>Published in Group Discussions at the Lushan Conference</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) A special dispatch from Telinger: Chairman Wang made the following full text of his introduction to education issues during group discussions at the Lushan Conference on the 20th:</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the severity of the national crisis, the national education community has been stimulated and unanimously invigorated, and has made active efforts. With the stability of the country and the increase in funding, education at all levels has seen considerable progress in both quality and quantity. However, the international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. Our work of building and saving the country should concentrate human and material resources in education and culture, and make more planned and step-by-step efforts to meet the needs of the country. In order to facilitate discussion, I will first briefly explain the current status of various education items:</p>
<p>㊀ Regarding compulsory education</p>
<p>The central government started implementing it in 1935. Currently, there are about 40 million school-age children in the country, and more than 20 million children are out of school. It was initially planned to have 80% or more of school-age children receive one-year, two-year short-term elementary school, and four-year elementary school education within five years. Since its implementation, the central government and various Geng funds have subsidized various provinces and cities with 3.2 million yuan in compulsory education funds in 1935. The compulsory education funds raised by various provinces and cities themselves totaled 11.5 million yuan. The number of students enrolled increased by 3,446,900. In 1936, the central government and various Geng funds subsidized various provinces and cities with 4.62 million yuan in compulsory education funds. The compulsory education funds raised by various provinces and cities themselves totaled about 16 million yuan. The number of students enrolled increased by about 5 million. This implementation result is not far from the original estimate. In 1937, the original plan will continue to be implemented. At the same time, the existing elementary schools will expand their enrollment and adopt a two-part system to facilitate children's enrollment. In addition, the compilation and printing of elementary school textbooks is being actively carried out.</p>
<p>㊁ Regarding the return of popular public education to education by the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>In order to actively eliminate illiteracy, the Ministry of Education announced the outline for the implementation of remedial education for out-of-school people, and plans to achieve the goal of eliminating illiteracy within six years. According to the results of the promotion last year, 12 million out-of-school people have received remedial education, and 4.3 million copies of civil school textbooks have been compiled and distributed free of charge to various provinces and cities. This year's funding for this item is listed as 1.4 million yuan, and the original plan will continue to be implemented. In addition, the promotion of broadcast education and film education. As of December 1936, the Ministry of Education has distributed 1,000 radios to various provinces and cities, and more than 900 have been installed by the provinces and cities themselves. All secondary schools in the country have a public education section, which can directly receive broadcasts. The Ministry of Education has divided the country into 81 film education mobile screening areas, and some of the projectors needed for film education have been manufactured and distributed for application. This year's funding for electrical education is listed as 700,000 yuan. The promotion of broadcasting and film education will continue to be actively promoted, and the installation of various machines will be distributed free of charge or subsidized.</p>
<p>㊂ Regarding the training of compulsory education teachers and normal education</p>
<p>In order to train compulsory education teachers, the Ministry of Education has formulated measures for compulsory education teacher training classes in various provinces and cities, ordering various provinces and cities to comply with the total number of normal schools in the country. According to the survey in 1934, there were only 876 schools, and only 22,000 graduates each year were insufficient for application. Therefore, they were ordered to divide the normal school areas and expand according to the needs of local teachers, and set up simple rural normal schools and attach special normal courses and simple normal courses to normal schools and senior high schools to train elementary school teachers for the promotion of compulsory education.</p>
<p>㊃ Regarding secondary education</p>
<p>According to the survey in 1934, there are about 1,900 secondary schools in the country, and the total number of junior high school students is about 70,000. In recent years, the Ministry of Education has paid attention to the psychology and quality improvement of secondary schools, such as formulating measures for compulsory extracurricular sports for students, all students must participate in sports, and enrich the equipment of physics and chemistry instruments. In 1936, 80 sets of high school physics instruments, 180 sets of chemistry instruments, and 2,000 sets of junior high school physics instruments were manufactured and distributed to secondary schools in various provinces and cities for adoption. Start compiling some textbooks for application in various secondary schools, and seek to improve the further study of secondary school teachers. In the summer of 1935, 1936, and 1937, designated universities to hold summer training classes for secondary school teachers in conjunction with local education administrative agencies, hoping that teachers of all subjects in secondary schools will have at least one opportunity to participate in three years.</p>
<p>㊄ Regarding vocational education</p>
<p>According to statistics in 1934, there are about 350 vocational schools in the country, with a total of 46,000 students. In order to actively promote production education, the Ministry of Education ordered various provinces and cities to allocate at least 35% of the secondary school funding ratio to vocational schools by 1927. In order to enrich excellent public and private vocational schools, 430,000 yuan was allocated from the production education fund in 1936 to subsidize the equipment fees of excellent vocational schools across the country. Subsidies will continue in 1937, and it is planned to reorganize more than 30 mechanical vocational schools across the country within three years, so that more than 10,000 graduates of mechanical vocational schools will be trained in four or five years to meet the needs of construction. Vocational schools such as agriculture and midwifery are also planning to formulate annual reorganization plans. On the one hand, funds will be allocated annually from the production fund to establish national industrial vocational schools in the central locations of the country as models for vocational schools across the country.</p>
<p>㊅ Regarding higher education</p>
<p>At present, there are more than 110 schools above the junior college level in the country, with a total of more than 40,000 students. Recently, the Ministry of Education has paid attention to the reorganization of higher education, paying attention to the adjustment of departments, the full-time appointment of teachers, the rationalization of school funding, the improvement of teaching standards, and the promotion of research. Emphasis is placed on the development of medicine, agriculture, and engineering in order to cultivate excellent and sufficient talents to meet the needs of the country, and to appropriately increase the number of higher education institutions in remote or inland areas so that the distribution of regions gradually becomes more balanced. Special funds are allocated to subsidize excellent private junior colleges and universities across the country. The amount in 1936 was 730,000 yuan, and there will be a considerable increase this year. In addition, attention is paid to the addition of research institutes and the control of international students. The central government has also increased funding for higher education in recent years.</p>
<p>㊆ Regarding other special education facilities</p>
<p>In order to implement special training during the national crisis, the Ministry of Education has formulated the general outline of special education for schools at all levels and distributed it to schools for effective implementation. Special attention is paid to border education, and 500,000 yuan is allocated each year to subsidize border provinces for the promotion of education for Mongolian, Tibetan, Jia Miao, and Yi ethnic groups. An additional 230,000 yuan is allocated annually for youth education in the four northeastern provinces, specifically for the relief of out-of-school youth in the four northeastern provinces. Furthermore, in conjunction with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Education has drafted measures to reorganize overseas Chinese education and actively improve it. The above is an overview of the current education in our country. I hope that you will give it a thorough review and give accurate instructions on all the efforts and improvements that should be made in future education, so as to help with the facilities and provide a reference.</p>

<h3>Municipal Museum Plans to Establish an Aquarium</h3>
<p>The Municipal Museum was instructed by the municipal government in June, considering that there are no fewer than tens of millions of fishermen along the coast and rivers of our country who depend on fishing for a living. However, the production methods are backward, and fishing encroachment is severe. Shanghai is also an important fishing port. In order to enhance public understanding of the fishing industry, improve production, and resist fishing encroachment, it is planned to establish an aquarium. Furthermore, since the aquarium is an affiliated undertaking of the museum, the museum is responsible for the preparatory work and has designated 14,000 square meters of land south of Qiujiang, north of Zhengtong Road, and west of Funan Left Road in the two administrative districts of the city center for the construction of the municipal aquarium.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Eliminates Educational Procurement Malpractices</h3>
<p>Methods are established, and sub-bureaus are instructed to comply.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, considering that the educational authorities in various counties have deeply ingrained malpractices in the use of construction and procurement funds, resulting in substantial annual expenditures while school buildings remain in disrepair and equipment remains lacking. This is all due to the lax supervision by county bureaus, and the failure of supervisors and responsible education committee members to overcome personal relationships, or even collusion and fraud, which is deeply regrettable. Therefore, it has specially drafted temporary measures for the construction and procurement of county education bureaus, sections, and county-level educational institutions in Jiangsu Province, with the aim of eliminating accumulated malpractices. A copy of the original measures has been issued to all counties for compliance.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Shorts Seem to be Covering: Unified Bonds Soar Two or Three Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange gradually turned to a peak, and the situation slightly reversed. Shorts became panicked and began to cover positions, causing market prices to skyrocket. The bond market, which had been heavily suppressed for two weeks, finally began to show its face. Throughout yesterday, the market opened with a calm atmosphere, and demand from various camps surged, leading to a strong upward trend. Prices for various bonds rose by more than two to three and a half yuan. Bonds No. 3, 14, 18, 45, 50, and 24 were bought, while only No. 6 and 10 were sold to a small extent. In the secondary market, there was temporarily more selling, but only Category E bonds rose by a quarter of a yuan, while the rest slightly retreated by two, three, or seven to eight cents. The total turnover amounted to 29,085,000 yuan. The resulting comparison of rises and falls is listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>Lucrative Public Bond Arbitrage</p>
<p>Under the current phenomenon of a bond market where near-term prices are weak and long-term prices are firm (comparing the situation over two months), previous large-scale purchases can now be confirmed as speculative. This is because July-term public bonds can yield three yuan in interest. Looking at yesterday's closing prices (setting aside the initial market), the current month is only four cents more expensive than the August term, resulting in a profit of two yuan and six cents. If this is an investment arbitrage of two yuan and six cents, discounting by 30%, then the public bond interest rate reaches more than 3.5%. Despite such a high interest rate, the financial community is still watching from the sidelines, demonstrating that speculative waves hinder investment books. Where is the initial intention of advocating actively promoting interest rate policies and reforming the unified public bond now? I respectfully record the two-month difference in the secondary market yesterday morning for reference.</p>
<p>This phenomenon has been occurring for several days. Regardless of the need to deduct commissions and the difference in buying and selling prices, the generosity of the interest is undeniable and truly unparalleled.</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Declines Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday (21st), the New York stock market was erratic, and trading was sparse. The total turnover for the day was 980,000 shares. According to brokers, prices are likely to continue to fluctuate, but there does not appear to be a crisis of a severe decline. Therefore, it is advisable to retain purchased stocks. Those with sufficient cash can take advantage of the dips to add to their positions.</p>
<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Benchmark Gold and Fine Gold Both Retreat Yesterday</p>
<p>The gold market retreated yesterday along with fine gold. With public bonds rebounding and people's confidence restored, the morning began with the London spot gold price unchanged. The central bank's posted prices revealed that both British and American gold prices were flat, and customs gold was unchanged. The benchmark gold bond remained at 1135.7 yuan, opening in the morning at 1144.5 yuan. Dadecheng, Wuchangxiang, Yifeng, Yongyuanmao, and Yongtuoshou sold off, retreating to three and a half yuan. Shengyuan, Yongyuanmao, and Yongnatiao raised to three yuan and eight cents. Yifeng, Yongyu, and Xixiang were still selling. The afternoon close retreated to 1142.5 yuan, a drop of three yuan compared to the previous close and a level still seventeen yuan higher than the settlement price. The addition of water to fine gold turned lower, at about 50 yuan, with a price of 1200 yuan. Jingfu sold 140 taels, Dafengheng 70 taels, and Tongfengheng 50 taels, all of which were absorbed by silver shops. There are still 189 bars of this month's strips remaining, 630 bars for August, and 854 bars for September. Among these, there are 14 long positions and 9 short positions. One hundred and sixty-one bars were traded in half-extinguished transactions.</p>
<h3>Speculation on the Soaring Price of Fine Gold</h3>
<p>The soaring price of fine gold the other day and the horizontal jump in jewelry gold were said to be influenced by the Yangtze River and the inland areas, a similar reflection to the drop in public bonds. Shanghai tycoons can sell off and buy foreign exchange, while people in the inland, hearing the news of the drop in public bonds, are anxious and helpless, with the only option being to scramble to buy gold. This was the direct cause of the rise in fine gold the other day, while small banks indirectly felt the tremors.</p>
<p>The addition of water to fine gold has always been based on sample gold. If the benchmark gold price is 1140 yuan, then fine gold should be about 15 yuan higher, because benchmark gold has a fineness of 978, while fine gold has a fineness above 99. There is a difference of thirteen points in fineness between the two. However, since benchmark gold switched to opening gold for debt settlement on September 8, 1924, the market has been sluggish, and the source has also become silent. Furthermore, due to the low-interest-rate policy, arbitragers have also been releasing spot goods one after another, which the central bank has always been absorbing, resulting in a surprisingly dry base. Benchmark gold is also restricted by the settlement price, unable to receive goods upon maturity. Although London gold prices have not been expensive, ordinary merchants have no ability to directly order, and the situation still requires water fees and all kinds of miscellaneous expenses. Various spot gold houses have no choice but to act within their means and cautiously sell, and as a result, the demand for pure gold exceeds the supply, and market prices have soared.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand is Complex</h3>
<p>The Outcome is Close to Flat and Relatively Firm</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market initially showed that overseas telegrams indicated that London had narrowed by 125 for nearby months and 0625 for distant months. The New York silver market remained flat, with the British pound rising 7 mills against the US dollar, 69 centimes against the French franc, and unchanged against the Japanese yen. The US dollar narrowed by 0625 against the British pound, fell 2.875 against the French franc, and remained unchanged against the Japanese yen. The morning opening prices for nearby months were the same as the previous close, but distant British pounds and US dollars each loosened by 03125. Later, foreign firms and Chinese merchants vigorously bought US dollars, while banks aggressively sold them. HSBC posted prices that were flat for both British pounds and US dollars, gradually loosening. The forward market was even more so. However, banks took advantage of the cheap prices to buy forward sterling, while customers bought East Asian currencies. Midway through the session, more US dollars were offered from abroad. Foreign firms continued to buy British pounds and Japanese yen, while Chengjin bought US dollars and the Bank of China sold them. The situation was still loose. At the close, nearby prices were the same as the previous close for both British pounds and US dollars, and both were firm for distant months. The Japanese yen was also the same. Chinese merchants and foreign firms were buying from abroad, while banks were selling. Northern merchants sold US dollars and bought Japanese yen, with brisk trading.</p>
<p>British currency: Mecca and Great British sold 125 for October, China Italy sold 1875 for August. Later, profit Great British sold 15625 for September to the foreign bank, with a turnover of about 80,000 to 90,000 pounds.</p>
<p>American currency: Mecca Lee Hua Yi sold 2875 and 25 for September to the foreign bank, HSBC Mecca Lee sold 15625 and 1875 for October, Mecca Lee Shanghai sold 25 for September, profit Lee sold 09125, 125 and 1875 for November, Dalian helped sell to Citibank Mitsui for October, five foreign countries sold spot goods of 59375 to Citibank Huabi, and profit sold 125 for November. Later, Citibank entered 4375 for August from abroad, Mecca Lee sold 1875 for October to Xin Feng, and the Bank of China sold 4375 for August to Zhengjin, with a turnover of about one million yuan.</p>
<p>East Asian currency: Zhengjin and Sanmai sold 101.75 for July to Tianjin and Dalian gangs. Later, North Korea Zhengjin sold 101.75 for July to the foreign bank, with a turnover of about 600,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Public Bonds Rebound, Cotton Yarn Quickly Rises: However, Osaka Spot Yarn and Thread Plunge</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending upward again, with floating shorts covering positions and longs active. At the same time, public bonds are rebounding, boosting people's confidence. In addition, in recent times, demand from all sides has been smooth, and inventory in warehouses has been gradually decreasing, so the market is solid. However, cloth trading is sluggish, the condition of American cotton is deteriorating daily, and Osaka spot yarn and thread have plummeted. The price of 20-count spot yarn is already at a high level.</p>
<p>October Up Five Yuan, Two Corners</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market, prices for all months turned upward, and sentiment was good. Floating shorts covered positions, and prices rose by 1.9 to 3.2 yuan. However, overseas cotton industry conditions are still trending downward. Nevertheless, spot yarn trading is still considered robust, and cloth factories in the interior have not stopped stocking up. After the market stabilized, the prices for November and December were requested by the directors and chairmen of the brokers' association to the supervisors, and it was allowed to start trading temporarily before the completion of the registration certificate procedures for yarn factories and yarn and cotton merchants. The results of the marked yarn market show that prices for all months rose by 2.5 to 5.2 yuan compared to the closing prices of the previous day. The sales volume was 300 bales for Yuanda, 500 bales for Hexing, 500 bales for Fengtai, 600 bales for Shenji, 450 bales for Qianchang, 350 bales for Dachang, 400 bales for Fukang, and 300 bales for Yongda. The purchases were 500 bales for Dafu, 200 bales for Guji, 350 bales for Tongfeng, 350 bales for Renfeng, 1150 bales for Yuan Yi, 950 bales for Runkang, and 350 bales for Shengyuan. The half-day market prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Rises Back by Three to Four Yuan</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. According to statistics, the total purchase volume by various groups throughout the day was 1516 bales. Selling prices are average. Japanese yarn rose by 3.4 yuan. The purchase volume of each group is as follows.</p>
<p>The Condition of American Cotton is Deteriorating Daily; Local Cotton Rebounded Yesterday: An Expected Phenomenon After Days of Sharp Declines</p>
<p>After days of sharp declines in the cotton market, there was a dramatic rebound yesterday. This situation was also expected. Because spot cotton prices are low and the sales of delivered cotton yarn are brisk, factories may have a chance to develop. And futures cotton is also relatively cheap.</p>
<p>Chenhua Surges by Two Yuan, Two Corners</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton market, prices rose rapidly as the yarn market rose and the recent downward trend suddenly reversed, aided by a piece of good news. Prices for all months surged by 5 cents to 1.2 yuan. After the second session, it remained quiet. By the close, there was more floating short covering, and August jumped again by 7 cents. The result of marked cotton was that Chenhua rose by 1.2 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, and the new rose by 1 to 1.6 yuan. The sales volume was 1800 dan for Tongxing, 900 dan for Hexing, 1200 dan for Ruid, 600 dan for Zhongda, 900 dan for Shenji, 700 dan for Taichang, 1400 dan for Yichang, and 600 dan for Laikang.

The highest and lowest prices for half a day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Indian Cotton Consumption Remains Stagnant</p>
<p>Futures cotton has been falling sharply for a long time and is gradually showing signs of rebounding and stabilizing. The demand for spot cotton by factories remains sluggish. However, the sales of cotton yarn continue. The environment has improved slightly, and factories may have a chance to develop. 200 bales arrived at the dock. It is also reported that the market situation in Tianjin, Hankou, and other places is erratic due to the impact of the current situation.</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Restores Six-Month Term Trading</p>
<p>Regarding the restoration of six-month term trading in the marked yarn market, the Ministry's order approved the opening of trading. The November and December terms were added as usual the other day. Subsequently, due to cumbersome registration procedures, they could not be issued in time and could not be traded as usual. The directors and chairmen of the brokers' association went to the supervisors to convey the difficulties and asked the supervisors to observe the business difficulties and temporarily allow all legitimate yarn factory and yarn and cotton merchants to accept buying and selling commissions as usual before the registration and certificate procedures are completed in order to maintain business and prevent stagnation.</p>
<p>World Cotton Markets Plummet</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, and the news from Liverpool was not good. Longs closed positions, and foreign merchants, New Orleans, and local gangs sold off. The weather was favorable, and pest damage was not severe. Prices for all months fell by 6 points to 1 pound sterling. Spot demand and cloth sales were poor, and new purchases were lacking. Although there was opportunistic buying and short covering, it could not withstand the general sentiment of selling. The close was calm. Spot goods fell by 19 pounds sterling, futures fell by 16 to 19 pounds sterling, British cotton spot goods fell by 9 points, and futures fell by 19 to 21 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to the sale of futures traders and shorts, but then rebounded slightly due to purchases by the same industry, short covering, cotton merchants buying Indian cotton, and selling American cotton. In the end, it was exhausted due to bad news from Liverpool. The prices of Pingguo rose by 1.5 to 2 rupees, Aomura fell by 2.75 to 3 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 2.5 to 2.71 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 21st).</p>
<p>▲ Osaka, 22nd Osaka telegram, spot yarn fell by 4 to 8 yuan, 16-count fan surface 235 yuan, fell by 5 yuan, 20-count goldfish 255 yuan, fell by 4 yuan, 40-count five stars 350 yuan, fell by 7 yuan, 42-count pheasant 365 yuan, fell by 8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>East White Fine Cloth Sales are Particularly Strong</p>
<p>▲ Printed Colored Fabrics are Sold at Reduced Prices: Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw a consistent rebound in marked yarn and cotton. The buying interest in East Piece Goods and General Merchandise was slightly stronger. Local dyeing factories and wholesalers took advantage of the low prices to purchase more than 1,000 pieces, with fine cloth being the main commodity. It is said that the colored cloth belt along the Yangtze River is stirring, so they rushed to cover their positions. The market price of dyed blank fine cloth rebounded by 5 cents to 1 dime per piece. However, fine twill and color twill are weakly priced due to flat customer demand. The market is still weak. Japanese merchant companies and foreign firms are selling various types of spot printed blank cloth at reduced prices due to the decline in demand from printing factories. Offered prices can be negotiated, but transactions are very rare. The prices of Donghuo direct tribute pique and tribute satin, which are cleaned, dyed, and finished, have been falling continuously. They fell again yesterday (per yard) by 1.5 cents. The white cloth goods from this factory are still firm. Orders from Sichuan, Guangdong, and the Yangtze River are still strong. The supply of spot goods is limited. However, cleaned goods pique yarn twill currently have active sales, and sales are average. Bleached cloth and blue cloth, which were originally maintained and did not fall, are now continuing to rebound by 2-3 cents. Deep and light colored printed cloth is extremely sluggish.</p>
<p>▲ Yuanfang Auction House Has Not Yet Opened: Yesterday was Thursday, the scheduled auction day for Yuanfang Foreign Firm of this city. Due to the instability of the situation in the north, foreign goods piece goods industry counterparts held a meeting at the firm at 9:00 AM. After discussions between the firms, it was decided to temporarily suspend the auction for another period to observe the situation. It is tentatively scheduled to open next Thursday.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Saigon Rice is Fixed to Open at 4,000 Tons: The Price is Seven Yuan, Five Jiao, Four Fen: Kexian Rice Sales in the North and South are Not Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, Kexian rice digestion remained strong. Oil heads and greedy buyers remained active. Inland local streets were also not weak. Northwest Yang and Weihai gangs also made some small purchases every day. Yesterday's transactions exceeded 16,000 bags. High-grade rice continued to rise by 4-5 cents. Given the lively state of the north, south, and local Kexian rice, the market may need to be expanded further. However, Saigon No. 1 rice is newly fixed to open at 4,000 tons, sold by a certain foreign firm, etc., at a price of 7 yuan, 5 jiao, and 4 fen. However, with the addition of taxes, each stone must cost about 13 yuan, which is not something that merchants can afford to divide. However, Kexian rice may be slightly flattened because of this. Yesterday, 5,819 bags of Jiangxi rice, 5,578 bags of Hubei rice, and 5,000 bags of Hancao rice were released.</p>
<p>Flour and Wheat Have Mostly Automatically Closed Out: Flour Factories Have Also Reduced Production</p>
<p>The prices of flour and wheat on the market remain unchanged. Due to the current situation, the prices of all months are automatically closing out. Although the distance between the standard and spot goods is still far, at this point, it seems that there is no longer any interest in the market. The situation of spot goods is also stagnant, with no obvious transactions. The export of flour is restricted, and factories have reduced production. Wheat is naturally unwilling to be cheaply sold because of the high price of flour in other cities. This kind of stalemate may not be broken for a while, and it also has an impact on the social economy.</p>
<p>The Rising Trend of He Xia Rice Has Stopped</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs were more than 30 numbers, with a total of 67-800 stones. The rising trend of the previous dynasty still had aftershocks yesterday. At the beginning of the morning, the hands, urban and rural stores, and stomachs were still quite active. The selling side shouted higher and higher, and the prices of thick and early japonica rice all increased by 2-3 jiao. The price of thin rice also increased by about 1 jiao. However, the market suddenly turned sluggish at noon, and the market color returned to softening. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice both fell by a few fen to about 1 jiao. According to this situation, it seems difficult for the market to develop in the future, or to move towards a softer position. Duyang sharp high grade A, yuan reached a good price, etc.</p>
<p>(Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of Shanghai from various places were few, only 11-12 numbers. At the opening of the market in the morning, because the rising trend of the previous market was not strong, the customers also wanted to shout for a tightening of about 1 jiao, the intentions of the noodle shops became weaker, and the situation turned peaceful again, causing the trading of various goods to be sluggish. What was traded was also limited, and the market shape was fixed and laborious. The price of early and thin rice, which was in short supply, was not opened. The prices of various grains and other remaining goods were peaceful.</p>
<p>Yellow Beans are Driven by the Sales of Bean Cakes</p>
<p>Yesterday's yellow bean market, regardless of new or old goods, saw a good situation. Because of the lack of high-quality new beans, the sales of various gangs were tireless, so the atmosphere turned upward by 7-8 fen. The transactions were 4-500 bags of Chengmentou beans, 210 bags of Zhengyang beans, 300 bags of Jiangqiao beans, and 61 bags of Zhuxi beans. Old beans were still active due to the lively sales of bean cakes, with a total of more than 20,000 pieces of various brands of factory cakes made for both spot and futures. The market price rose by 2 fen, so people had to tighten, temporarily unaffected by the falling trend in the Lianshi market. However, the oil pressing factories were watching the stomach reflex, because the selling price was shouted high. Yesterday, the Guanggang, etc. on this street only handled 450 bags of Tancheng beans, 3 cars of Zhengyangguan beans, and 40 bags of Hankou Zhazha beans.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>There is no Shortage of Silk Reelers to Exit White Silk Factories</p>
<p>The silk market was weak in the morning and firm at noon. The silk sales of users and gangs were active yesterday. Shanghai white silk factories and Shandong factories all made transactions. The sale volume was generally the same. Because the inventory in this port was sparse and the arrivals were not many, the price of Sichuan and Lu silks was relatively firm. The sale volume of Shanghai white silk factories varied greatly. During the morning trading, the reelers exited, and the price of Tiantai grade Silk was 780 yuan. Some said that the lowest new price for this and that silk was 760 yuan. In the afternoon, because the price of Yokohama silk rebounded, the sentiment in this port also tended to be good. Ordinary white silk factories hovered above 800 yuan, while Yangfan silk was around 815 yuan. A total of 80 dan were traded. In the foreign firm silk market, British and French silk remained unmoved, and American silk remained silent. There was a slight purchase of non-sale silk, with a total of 37 dan for GuBao Mian, etc.</p>
<p>The Sales of Red and Green Tea Have Revived</p>
<p>Yesterday's red and green tea market rebounded. The inventory of Keemun and Ningxia black tea was only more than 20,000 boxes. British Zhuang and various foreign firms heard that Anhui Local Bank and Jiangxi Provincial Yumin Bank had prepared funds to buy all of them. The intention to enter suddenly turned strong. Chia Wo, Jinlong Baochang and other firms all selected and purchased a lot. The sentiment was quite excited. The trading of Zhuang green tea was still not lonely. Among the various goods, Xizhen Meishui and Mei Xiu Mei had the most smooth sales. Although the current inventory is not very abundant, the selling price has not risen. Zhongguan Zhenmei, Low Zhuang Zhenmei, and He He Fushi Baolong had slightly purchased, and the price had become softer than before by 2 jiao. At the Ping Shui tea market yesterday, Jinlong handled the Da Bang of National Goods at a price of 41 yuan. Also, Chia Wo and Cha Ban handled several colors of the Yipinxiang Da Bang, and the price was still stable. Xiehe handled more than 100 boxes of Tuzhuang Dingwenchang, at a price of about 50 yuan. In addition, the trading of eyebrow tea was still quite lively.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods</h3>
<p>Pickled Mustard Tubers Rebounded by a Small Yuan</p>
<p>Pickled mustard tubers have been arriving in abundance recently. Due to the recent situation, the merchants have no intention of storing them in warehouses and want to sell them off quickly, causing the market to rebound by a small yuan. The market price of the genuine Luoxi Cai brand has been reduced to 30 yuan, and the price of Ling Cai has been reduced to 25 yuan. The customer sales stock is booming, and the business is currently in season, so the market is still stable. The market price is 26 yuan for the market sales, 29 yuan for Yu Tong, 24 yuan and 5 jiao for Hongli Yue, 22 yuan for Zengling Cai Gao, and 20 yuan for the lower grade.</p>

<p>▲Assembly Declaration</p>
<p>What time is it now? It is the time that concerns the continuation or interruption of China's five-thousand-year history and the survival or extinction of the 400 million people of the Chinese nation. To resist the enemy is to live; to fail to resist the enemy is to die. To fight to the death is to live; to greedily cling to life is to die. All those with blood and breath share this sentiment. Since the September 18th Incident to now, six years have passed. The Chinese nation's love for peace and its efforts to endure humiliation have been demonstrated to the world. However, the more we retreat, the more the enemy advances. Their intention is to never stop until they have exterminated the entire Chinese nation. Even with the Lugouqiao Incident, repeated provocations are not enough. They even use the name of compromise to conduct troop deployments in secret, intending to use military force to achieve their ambition of gradual encroachment. This is a blood debt that cannot be tolerated. Now the central government has announced a policy of self-defense, and the soldiers all have the determination to die. All Chinese people should rise up, unify their organizations, concentrate their strength, seek survival with iron and blood, and provide assistance in resisting the enemy. With one heart and one mind, we should always keep this in mind, each exerting their abilities and each doing their best. We vow not to slacken until we achieve the goal of territorial integrity and national rejuvenation. Alas, if our country does not want to survive, then so be it; if our nation does not want to live, then so be it. If we want to survive, then for the next ten years, there will be no day without war. Whether fighting or negotiating, we are still at war. Compatriots, from today onwards, strengthen your resolve and sharpen your weapons. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, act swiftly, ensure sufficient food and soldiers, and do not rely on temporary enthusiasm. Engage in a permanent war of resistance, never forgetting this shame and never slackening in your determination. Fathers advise, brothers encourage, forever remember and never forget. This declaration is hereby made for your public assessment.</p>
<p>▲Committee Meeting</p>
<p>Finally, slogans were shouted: ㊀ Unite to resist the enemy, ㊁ Eliminate traitors, ㊂ Support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, ㊃ Long live the Republic of China. It was also learned that the association is scheduled to hold its first committee meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at 4:00 PM on the 24th (Saturday). At that time, in addition to electing the secretary-general and other important officers and handling matters entrusted by the general assembly, a special committee will be established to actively promote the association's affairs.</p>
<h3>Flour Shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin and Tanggu Was Seized by the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Over 300,000 Bags of Flour Seized in Warehouses in Tianjin and Tanggu, Valued at Over 1 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in North China, Shanghai's shipping industry has suffered a major blow. Recently, merchants from Tianjin also suffered a particularly huge loss, namely, a large quantity of flour was seized by the Japanese army for military use. Emergency meetings have been held for days without any remedy. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Both Wharves Occupied</p>
<p>When the Japanese army advanced into Shanhaiguan and arrived in Fengtai and Tianjin, they first occupied the Tanggu wharf and cargo ships of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for military use. The wharf is very large and can simultaneously berth three oceangoing vessels of 4,000 to 5,000 tons. Its warehouse capacity is the largest of all companies in Tanggu. After the wharf and warehouse were occupied, the Tianjin line of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's liners was immediately suspended. Yesterday, the company continued to receive telegrams from Tianjin reporting that the company's wharf and warehouse in Zizhu Forest in Tianjin had also been forcibly occupied by the Japanese army. Japanese troops were stationed in each warehouse. Zizhu Forest is located in the British Concession. How could the Japanese army forcibly occupy it? It turns out that the Osaka Company's wharf is adjacent to it. The Japanese army then invaded the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's warehouse from the Osaka wharf. Therefore, as of yesterday, the wharves and warehouses in Tianjin and Tanggu had been occupied.</p>
<p>Flour Seized as Military Rations</p>
<p>The total amount of flour recently shipped from Shanghai and stored in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's warehouse in Tanggu was more than 300,000 bags. The current market price is more than four yuan per bag, totaling 1.26 million yuan in national currency. The Tianjin Zizhu Forest wharf and warehouse also contained grains and flour worth hundreds of thousands of yuan. After the Japanese army occupied the two warehouses, they seized all the huge amount of flour stored in the warehouses, worth more than 1 million yuan, to be used as rations for the Japanese army entering Shanhaiguan. This time, the company's "Gongping" ship was loaded with the latest batch of flour to Tanggu and had just been unloaded into the warehouse when it was seized. The "Gongping" ship only telegraphed to Shanghai yesterday morning, saying that it had left Tanggu. It was also fortunate that the ship was not detained.</p>
<p>Shanghai Merchants Hold Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>The bad news of the seizure of this huge amount of flour reached Shanghai, and the merchants in Shanghai who handled this flour were shocked. The batch of flour was recently purchased by merchants in Shanghai on behalf of merchants in Tianjin. It had just been shipped to Tianjin and Tanggu when the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, and it was seized in full for use as military rations. It involved the merchants' capital of as much as 1.26 million yuan. Because the matter was too serious, the merchants immediately convened an emergency meeting of those concerned yesterday to discuss ways to salvage the situation. As a result, apart from telegraphed appeals to the authorities of Hebei and Chahar for negotiations, there were no other solutions.</p>
<h3>Kawagoe's Southward Trip Temporarily Difficult to Realize</h3>
<p>The Kwantung Army Firmly Retains Him, and He Cannot Leave</p>
<p>According to a report from the Takung News Agency, according to relevant sources, the Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe Shigeru, originally planned to travel south to Nanjing on the 15th of this month to meet with Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui to discuss a solution to the Lugouqiao Incident. However, due to the firm retention of the Kwantung Army and the Tianjin Garrison Army, Kawagoe could not leave and announced its cancellation. It is now learned that the atmosphere in Tianjin and Beiping is still extremely tense. At the same time, a large number of Japanese troops are gathering, seemingly with major plans. Therefore, it is difficult to predict how the situation will evolve. As a result, Kawagoe seems unlikely to travel south for the time being. Moreover, Tajiri, the intelligence chief of the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai, recently went to Nanjing from Shanghai, also in response to Kawagoe's telegram, to receive a report on the general situation in Nanjing and Shanghai and to receive instructions on the future direction of diplomatic affairs. Based on this, Kawagoe is not preparing to travel south in the short term.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Beiping Flights Continue as Scheduled</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Northbound Plane Arrived in Beiping</p>
<p>After the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the situation in North China became tense. In order to maintain transportation between Shanghai and Beiping, the Shanghai-Beiping flights of the China National Aviation Corporation continued as scheduled yesterday. The plane took off from Longhua Airport in Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday, carrying three passengers to Beiping. It arrived at Nanyuan Airport in Beiping at 2:45 PM that afternoon and will fly south from Beiping today.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, More Students Returning from Japan</h3>
<p>Totaling More Than 40 People</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident became serious, Chinese students in Japan have returned to China in batches on their own initiative. Yesterday, when the Shanghai Maru arrived in Shanghai, more than 40 people returned to the country.</p>
<h3>Records of Contemporary Figures' Movements</h3>
<p>Liu Ruiheng took the night express train to Nanjing yesterday. Xu Kan took the 5:30 PM express train out of Nanjing yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 10:30 PM.</p>
<p>Niu Yongjian took the 7:50 AM express train out of Nanjing yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 1:45 PM on the same day.</p>
<h3>The City Federation Issues a Notice to Pay Attention to Traitorous Activities</h3>
<p>Preventing Disruption of the Rear</p>
<p>The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District issued a notice to the district branches yesterday to pay close attention to traitorous activities. The original letter read: "Dear Sirs, at the third standing committee meeting of the association held on the 11th of this month, Committee Member Gu Yucang proposed that, as the war has broken out in North China and the situation is serious, the association should issue a notice to the district branches to pay close attention to traitorous activities. This proposal has been approved. The corresponding proposal is hereby sent to you. It is important to pay close attention to prevent traitors from disrupting the rear."</p>

<h3>Preparatory Work in Various Circles in This City During the Extraordinary Period</h3>
<p>After the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the enemy was insatiably greedy, and the people of the whole country were unanimously indignant. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech and announced the national policy, the people also understood the impact and began to make various preparations for the extraordinary period. For example, medical rescue and the statistics of food have been carried out separately. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Medical Rescue</p>
<p>In this North China incident, medical rescue is of paramount importance. Liu Ruiheng, Director of the National Health Administration, came to Shanghai today (22nd) to discuss the rescue work of the Red Cross Society with leaders from all walks of life. The reporter specifically interviewed Director Liu. Director Liu said that the administration and the Red Cross Society are actively preparing for medical rescue work for soldiers and civilians in the front. The organization of a severe injury surgery team in Beiping has long been completed. However, in the past few wars, although many compatriots in various places generously donated money to express their condolences, the items sent were not needed in the front, or they wanted to donate money without knowing where to send it, or they did not specify the purpose. As a result, the donors' expected goals were not achieved. Now the Red Cross Society is intensifying its work, purchasing materials, and recruiting personnel, all of which require funds. At present, we urgently hope that compatriots from all walks of life at home and abroad will automatically donate and actively contribute. All medical rescue supplies and medicines are welcome. Because what the soldiers and civilians in the front lack and urgently need is medical relief work, especially donations, so that they can purchase what is needed according to their discretion, which is more appropriate. All donations of funds and equipment can be directly delivered to the Shanghai China Red Cross Society or notified to the Health Administration for transfer. so that the Red Cross's front-line relief work can be carried out quickly.</p>
<p>In order to plan for the rescue of innocent soldiers and civilians as soon as possible, the medical institutions in this city have been actively preparing for the important work of the extraordinary period in accordance with the instructions of the Rescue Committee. According to sources, medical personnel have always been unwilling to lag behind in their loyalty to defend the country and resist the enemy. Now that all circles in Shanghai are preparing for this anti-enemy operation, the medical community should also catch up. The epidemic hospitals, the China Red Cross Hospital, the Chinese Medical Association, the Physicians' Association, the Anti-Epidemic Association, and various physicians' medical colleges in this city have all begun preparations. All rescue equipment and medicines have also been purchased. It is reported that as soon as the great war in North China begins, they will jointly mobilize and go north to carry out rescue work.</p>
<p>The United Federation of Charitable Organizations held a design group meeting at the Renji Hall at 5:00 PM yesterday. The design group leaders Zhao Jinqing, Qu Wenliu, Huang Hanzhi, Yin Guanzhi, and Xie Jiaqian were publicly elected. Zhao Jinqing, chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting. It was then decided through discussion to establish a "Special Design Committee" under the Federation of Charitable Organizations to be responsible for overall planning and methods for rescuing refugees in the war zone. The organization charter was passed on the spot, and responsible personnel were appointed.</p>
<p>Statistics on Grain</p>
<p>In order to cope with the extraordinary period, prevent grain from assisting the enemy, and implement merchants' automatic control, the Coarse Grain, Bean, and Rice Industry Association of this city has specially organized a Grain Arrival and Sales Committee. Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, and other 13 people were appointed as members. In order to carry out the work actively, the association held its first committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday on the third floor of the Coarse Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association on Minguo Road. Zheng Baozhao, Gu Xinyi, Yang Heqing, Chen Ziyi, and Cai Yukun, totaling 15 people, were present. Gu Xinyi was publicly elected as the temporary chairman, who first reported the purpose of the meeting and then discussed: ㊀ How to handle the investigation of the number of stocks? Resolved: Send personnel to each warehouse daily to investigate the actual stock quantity. ㊁ Investigation of the number of arrivals and sales? Resolved: The association shall prepare an investigation form and distribute it to the industry in appropriate quantities.

Resolved: The Municipal Association shall verify and statistically analyze the quantity of stocks and sales on a daily basis. ㊃ Local certification issues shall be handled in accordance with the previous resolution. It was resolved to submit it to the Municipal Government for approval and forward it to the Jianghai Customs for implementation. A notice was also issued saying: "Dear Sirs, the association, etc., convened an emergency meeting of the executive and supervisory committee members on the 20th of this month to discuss ways to prevent grain from assisting the enemy. It was resolved that all transactions of rice and grain from Dalian, Andong, Yingkou, Qinhuangdao, and Sipu should be rejected. Those who purchase rice from other ports in Shanghai must have a certificate from the local chamber of commerce before the transaction can be carried out. Industry members are notified to comply. The record of the meeting is hereby recorded and notified. It is hoped that everyone will follow these instructions."</p>
<p>National Products</p>
<p>The China National Products Manufacturers' Association of this city held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the Shuijili Association at 2:00 PM yesterday. The chairman was Liu Zhongying. Matters resolved: ㊀ At this extraordinary period, each member of the factory should make preparations for the extraordinary period and strictly control the output to maintain the needs of the country.

<h3>The Silk Fabric Industry Association Cables, Requesting the Cancellation of the Ban on Dry Cocoons Leaving the Province</h3>
<p>The Raw Materials Maintenance Committee Will Meet Today to Discuss Petitioning the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>After the Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces' cocoon and silk control agencies banned the export of dried cocoons, Shanghai silk factories and industries established a Raw Materials Maintenance Committee. Yesterday, they cabled Jiangsu Province, requesting the revocation of the ban, and have scheduled a meeting today to discuss petitioning strategies. The detailed situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Jiangxi and Zhejiang Announce a Ban on Export</p>
<p>After the silk control agencies of Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces banned the export of dried cocoons, the announcement of the Zhejiang Silk Control Committee is recorded as follows: "It has been found that silk factories within the province are already lacking in raw materials due to the spring cocoon collection this year. There have been reports of dried cocoons from within the province being continuously transported out, causing further panic among the province's silk factories regarding the raw materials they require. A strict ban should be implemented to maintain the livelihoods of employees and the operations of manufacturers. This matter has been submitted to the provincial government for approval and is being handled accordingly. In addition to instructing the silk improvement zones of all counties and cities to supervise and ensure the prohibition of all affiliated departments, this announcement is hereby issued to all silk factories and cocoon merchants within the province. They are required to comply. Before a clear order of lifting the ban is issued after this announcement, they must not transport dried cocoons out of the province. Those who dare to disobey will be severely punished without leniency. This announcement is also being published simultaneously with the rules for cocoon merchants to collect cocoons. Article 6 stipulates that the registration date for cocoon merchants to collect cocoons will be the first three days of each period. Priority registration will be given to silk factories within the province. The amount of cocoon collection registered for both the spring and autumn periods will be calculated according to the number of machines each factory has, limited to half of the factory's annual raw material needs. If the amount collected is insufficient, it will be supplemented during the summer period to supplement the spring period, and the late autumn period to supplement the autumn period. After the silk factories in the province have completed registration, ordinary registration will be processed if there is a surplus. The start and end dates of each registration period will be publicly announced by the committee in the newspapers."</p>
<p>Cables Requesting the Revocation of the Dry Cocoon Ban</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory and Industry Association cabled Jiangsu Province yesterday, stating: "Jiangsu Sericulture Improvement and Management Committee, it is reported that various member silk factories of our association have reported to the association that someone recently suggested to your committee to ban the transportation of dried cocoons purchased and stored by various silk factories in Jiangsu Province, and requested your committee to investigate the amount of cocoons stored in Jiangsu Province and the capacity of silk factories in Jiangsu Province to accommodate them. During the investigation period, the transportation of dry cocoons was temporarily prohibited, causing panic in Shanghai silk factories for raw materials. Even more fearful are the sources of workers' livelihoods. Please transfer the request to revoke the ban. I think that goods are valuable in circulation, so the ancients had people exchanging goods, so as to adjust the surplus to remedy the deficiency. Premier Sun Yat-sen considered the world to be public, removed the biases of territories, and allowed people to operate freely. It is recorded in the canons that there should be no parochialism. To separate Qin and Yue. Even things like cotton and wheat have never been heard of being investigated for the capacity of this province, but intercepted. If what the proposer requests is true, what is the difference between encouraging monopoly? Even if the prohibition of transportation is limited to the investigation period, the investigation is not a clearly defined period of time. It is always possible to disregard the need of Shanghai silk factories for cocoons, and the lives of tens of thousands of silk workers. Based on the previous report, I hereby issue a telegram, begging your committee to consider that the relationship is not limited to one party, and to give more consideration to this ban before it is issued, and to withdraw it after it has been issued. I cannot but pray for it."</p>
<p>A Meeting Will Be Held Today to Deliberate Petitioning</p>
<p>The Raw Materials Maintenance Committee of the association has scheduled a meeting of the committee at 6 PM today to decide on petitioning the Executive Yuan and other rescue measures. A reporter from Xin Sheng News met with a member of the committee yesterday, who said that the flour mills' purchasing of wheat, the textile mills' purchasing of cotton, and the linen mills' purchasing of hemp, are the same as the silk mills' pasturing of cocoons. If each raw material producing area must be self-sufficient and prohibit exports, then Shanghai will have no manufacturing factories. Therefore, it seems inappropriate for the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to ban the export of dried cocoons. If the export is prohibited to prevent dried cocoons from being transported overseas, the government can order the prohibition of exports. In short, Shanghai colleagues hope that the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will quickly revoke the ban to prevent Shanghai silk factories from shutting down and tens of thousands of workers from losing their jobs.</p>
<h3>Shandong Native Place Association Received Li Guang'an Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reported on the Course of the Incident; Decided to Uphold the Central Government's Intentions</p>
<p>Since the North China Incident occurred, people from all walks of life have been paying close attention. In order to understand the truth of this incident and its future evolution, the Shandong Native Place Association in this port held a discussion meeting at the Shandong Guild Hall on Ximen Road at 4 PM yesterday, inviting Mr. Li Guang'an, Director of the 29th Army's Shanghai Office. The meeting was attended by Shandong Native Place Association President Zhang Yipeng, Deputy Military Commander Ma Dengying, guests from all walks of life, and Shandong natives Zhao Pinsan, Shang Mujiang, Zhang Yiqing, Wan Futian, Gao Shikui, Wang Shicheng, Zou Jixian, Wang Fengji, Yang Dezhi, and others, more than twenty people in total. First, Chairman Zhang Yipeng reported on the significance of inviting Mr. Li, briefly stating that the 29th Army is fighting for the survival of the country with their lives, determined to coexist with Lugou Bridge, which is admirable. In recent years, many people have not fully understood Chairman Song's hard work and difficulties in maintaining North China, but since the occurrence of this incident, we should be able to understand the true face of the 29th Army. Today, we specially invited Director Li to report on the course of this incident and Chairman Song's hard work in maintaining North China, etc. Subsequently, Li Guang'an rose to report on the internal evolution of North China in recent years and the truth about the Lugou Bridge Incident. Finally, he summarized the conclusion that this incident is by no means an isolated incident in Hebei and Chahar. Regardless of peace or war, Chairman Song will only follow the orders of the Central Government. As for the future evolution of this incident, since no report has been received, it is not possible to draw a conclusion rashly. But what can be said is that the 29th Army will uphold the will of the Central Government and the wishes of the entire people. He especially hopes that the press will write more encouraging articles and fewer stimulating remarks, so as not to fall into the enemy's trap. After Li's report, it was already 5:30 PM, and the meeting was adjourned with tea and refreshments.</p>
<h3>The Constitutional Promotion Association Held its Second Meeting Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Songjiang Administration Submitted Fish Inspection Methods to the Ministry of Finance for Review</h3>
<p>The Association Claims that the Order to Stop Opening Cabins to Sell Fish Refers to the Fact that the Fish in the Second Class Had Less Salt</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance received a report from the Songjiang Administration, stating that the Qidong Fish and North Goods Trade Association requested changes to the fish and salt inspection methods, which were deemed appropriate. It ordered them to conduct inspections at any time to facilitate the fishing industry. A document from the Salt Affairs Administration stated, "The report submitted by the Songjiang Administration on the 436th of July 26, regarding the Qidong Fish and North Goods Trade Association's request to change the fish and salt inspection methods, has been found to be appropriate. The presentation to the Ministry of Finance has been noted. Since the Songjiang Administration has stated that the previous claims by the Qidong Fish and North Goods Trade Association that the fish and salt inspectors ordered the cessation of opening cabins to sell fish refers to the fact that the fish in the second class had more fish and less salt, the bureau has ordered all inspectors to consider the circumstances and make flexible arrangements for boats with more fish and less salt, and not to be overly demanding or difficult, nor to order the opening of cabins. The handling is very good. You are still to transfer the instructions to earnestly investigate and prevent difficulties at any time to facilitate the fishing industry. This order is issued by Minister Kong Xiangxi and Vice Minister Zou Lin."</p>
<h3>Sichuan Villagers Rescued Students from Disaster Areas Staying in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Deadline for Registration; It Has Been Decided to Extend the Deadline Starting Today</p>
<p>The Sichuan Shanghai Native Place Association has been registering students from Sichuan disaster areas. Yesterday was the deadline, but the association felt that Sichuan students receiving military training and serving in rural areas did not know about the registration, so only a small number of students from Datong, Faze, Tongde, etc. registered. The association decided to extend the deadline for another three weeks starting today to avoid any omissions, and stipulated that all students from severely affected areas in Sichuan whose families' support has been cut off must bring proof documents to be registered and then pooled for relief.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on Cars Registered with Out-of-Province Licenses in the City</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of car intercommunication among provinces and cities, car owners residing in this city often registered with other provinces and cities to avoid the higher tax rates in this city, and to favor the lighter ones. The municipal authorities, in view of the fact that the car intercommunication regulations stipulated the duration of stay, but it was difficult to check and crack down on them due to the inability to verify, which affected the car donation income, and caused difficulties in the management of car affairs, recently, the Finance, Police, and Public Works Bureaus specifically consulted and decided, "Any car licensed in the two special districts of this city (except for temporary transit permits) and simultaneously bearing licenses from other provinces and cities, driving within the city, will be cracked down on in accordance with the measures for punishing unregistered vehicles." It is heard that the aforementioned measures have been submitted to the municipal government for approval and filing, and will soon be published in the newspaper to notify all car owners, and letters will be sent to various provinces and cities and the National Highway Traffic Committee for review.</p>
<h3>Bund Bank Protection Levee Completed</h3>
<p>Another Section Will Continue Construction Immediately; There Will Be a Large Tide Next Month</p>
<p>The bank protection levee built by the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau on the Bund will continue to be added, and the location has been determined. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The First Section of the Water Levee Has Been Completed</p>
<p>The bank protection levee on the Bund from Edward Road in the south to Jiujiang Road in the east, which has been built by the Public Works Department, has now been completed. Only a small part of the outer surface of the levee needs to be slightly chiseled to make it more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Another Section Will Be Built</p>
<p>As for the section from Nanjing Road to Beijing Road on the Bund, the terrain of the bank protection is higher, so there is no need to build the same levee. However, from the northern end of the Beijing Road Bund to the Bund Park, the Public Works Department has also decided to continue adding a levee, which can be started in the coming days.</p>
<p>Large Tides Coming Next Month</p>
<p>Next month, autumn floods will begin. According to the Dredging Bureau's predictions, there will be large tides, especially the morning tides from the 6th to the 11th. According to measurements, the high tide on the 6th will be about eleven feet one and five inches, eleven feet nine inches on the 7th, eleven feet five and five inches on the 8th, twelve feet two inches on the 9th, eleven feet five and six inches on the 10th, and eleven feet zero five inches on the 11th. The height of the Bund Bank is only thirteen feet, and the water level is very close to the shore. If there is wind and rain, there is a possibility of overflowing the bank.</p>
<h3>Divorcee Requests Confirmation of Legitimate Child Case</h3>
<p>Blood Types are All Q Type; Former Husband Requests Adoption</p>
<p>Wu Xuezhen, a young woman from Luanhu Township, Wubaosi Village, Minhang District, Shanghai County, was married to Hua Shaoxiang from Erjiasi Village in the same township for a short period. Due to incompatibility, they divorced by agreement last spring. At the time of the divorce, Wu Xuezhen was already pregnant. On October 20th of last year, Wu Xuezhen gave birth to a daughter at the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital, named Hua Shaozi. Because Shaozi is indeed Hua Shaoxiang's child, Wu Xuezhen filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the local court last winter, requesting confirmation of the legitimate daughter. However, Hua Shaoqun insisted that Shaozi was not his biological child, but was born from Wu Xuezhen's adultery before the divorce. As a result, Hua Shaoxiang lost the lawsuit. Hua was dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court. After an expert examination by the Forensic Medicine Research Institute, it was found that the blood types of Hua Shaoxiang and Wu Xuezhen were both Q type, and the blood type of Hua Shaozi was also Q type, so it was determined that there was a possibility of birth. Recently, Hua Shaoxiang filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the local court against Wu Xuezhen, requesting the return of the legitimate daughter, claiming that the plaintiff and the defendant were originally husband and wife, and after they divorced by agreement in March of last year, the defendant gave birth to a daughter in October of the same year, but has not yet returned her, and should be ordered to return her. The case was heard by Judge Zhu yesterday. The plaintiff did not attend, and was represented by a lawyer. The defendant also did not attend, and only delegated lawyer Zhang Shewo to the court, arguing that the defendant should be designated as the guardian. The official adjourned the hearing until another date because both parties were not present.</p>
<h3>The Da Kang Bank Suspended Business</h3>
<p>Bank Runs Caused Illiquidity; A Post-Mortem Plan Pending Shareholders' Meeting</p>
<p>The Da Kang Bank on Ningbo Road suspended operations yesterday due to bank runs and the inability to recover loans, resulting in illiquidity. The Board of Directors decided to temporarily suspend operations from yesterday. All follow-up measures will be decided by the shareholders' meeting. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Temporary Suspension of Business</p>
<p>The Da Kang Bank was organized in February of the 23rd year of the Republic of China by Zhou Weishi, Zhang Qinbo, and others with a capital of 500,000 yuan, which was fully paid up at one time. The inaugural meeting was held on April 1 of the same year, and it was approved by both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry. It opened on August 1. The Chairman of the Board is Zhang Qinbo, and the Manager is Chen Gongfu. Its business is mainly commercial credit loans. Since the 24th year, due to the depression in commerce, it has been particularly cautious with various loans. Now, due to bank runs and the inability to recover loans, resulting in illiquidity, the Board of Directors decided to temporarily suspend operations from yesterday.</p>
<p>Follow-up Measures</p>
<p>From yesterday, the bank temporarily suspended operations in accordance with the Board of Directors' resolution. A reporter from Xin Sheng News learned from the bank yesterday that the total amount of fixed and current deposits is about 500,000 yuan, and the total amount of loans is about 1.4 million yuan. In the past week, it was rumored that the bank's operations with public bonds had failed, resulting in depositors running to withdraw their deposits. At the same time, due to the inability to recover loans, resulting in illiquidity, the bank was forced to suspend operations. All follow-up measures will be decided by the shareholders' meeting. As for the bank itself, it has not suffered losses. This time, it is really due to illiquidity.</p>
<h3>The First Special Court Accepted a Case of Tax Arrears by Spanish Nationals</h3>
<p>The Spanish Consulate Closed, First Case</p>
<p>Spanish national Sang Caizhi, 35 years old, was sued by the Public Works Bureau in the First Special District Court for owing about 400 yuan in patrolman's tax. The court issued an arrest warrant and approved his detention in the Huade Road West Prison. According to the statement of lawyer Chen, the defendant intended to avoid the patrolman's tax and transferred the store he opened to the management of a Dutch woman, seeking the protection of consular jurisdiction. This is the first case of our court detaining Spanish nationals after the closure of the Spanish consulate.</p>

<h3>Blood Case on Wenzhou Road</h3>
<p>Wu Rongqing Was Cut Seven or Eight Times; The Truth Is Still Difficult to Ascertain</p>
<p>Wu Rongqing, a native of Tiejiang, 28 years old, works as a staff member in the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road and has no family. Therefore, he usually resides at his brother Wu Siqi's residence at No. 6, Lane 157 (Hongjili), Wenzhou Road, in a small room. Yesterday morning, at about 7 AM, Wu Rongqing was just getting up to wash when more than a dozen men suddenly came to inquire. They learned that he had not gone out, and they swarmed upstairs and broke into the small room. One of the men pulled out a kitchen knife and slashed at Wu. Wu Rongqing was unable to dodge and was cut seven or eight times in the waist, abdomen, shoulders, and back, causing a lot of bleeding. He immediately fainted and fell to the ground. The perpetrators, seeing that their goal had been achieved, abandoned the knife and fled. By the time the landlord of the house got up and discovered the situation, the perpetrators had already fled without a trace. The landlord quickly reported to the Xin Zha Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate and immediately sent Wu to the hospital for treatment in an ambulance. His injuries were serious and his life was in danger. The murder weapon was taken to the police station for safekeeping, and detectives were ordered to pursue and arrest the perpetrators. The truth of the matter is still difficult to determine.</p>
<h3>First Cholera Stool Test</h3>
<p>Reportedly, Cholera Occurred in Ningbo; Patient's Stool Specially Sent to Shanghai; Test Results to be Released Tomorrow</p>
<p>According to reports, the Harbor Quarantine Office paid great attention to the fact that cholera patients were discovered in Ningbo Port last week. However, since Ningbo does not have the equipment to test cholera blood serum, it is difficult to determine whether it is true. Therefore, the China-America Hospital in Ningbo specially sent the patient's stool specimen to Shanghai for testing while keeping it frozen. The Quarantine Office attached great importance to this matter and specially ordered Dr. Bo Lishi of the Wusong No. 2 Hospital to test it. According to the office, the test results are scheduled to be released this Saturday. The office also stated that the Port of Shanghai is currently very safe and there has been no discovery of cholera.</p>
<h3>Wu Shaoqin Accuses His Wife of Adultery After Cutting Ties with His Family</h3>
<p>Two False Accusations Proven Untrue; Requests Publication of Verdict to Restore Reputation</p>
<p>Wu Shaoqin, a native of Nanhui residing at No. 5 Kangjili, Kangti Road in the French Concession (48 years old, a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine), is currently being prosecuted by Wang Guangquan, a prosecutor at the Shanghai District Court, on charges of false accusation. The prosecution alleges that Wu Shaoqin has a history of impropriety and excessive spending and has secretly taken a woman named Xiao as a concubine, neglecting his wife, Wu Jiangshi. His father, Wu Yiqin, allocated land and property to Wu Jiangshi in June of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China [1924], allowing her to live separately with her children. He also accused Wu Shaoqin of disobedience in the Nanhui County government. However, Wu Shaoqin, instead of repenting, harbored resentment towards Wu Jiangshi. In addition to filing a civil suit for cohabitation, which was entangled in litigation for three trials and ultimately rejected, he also accused Wu Jiangshi of adultery with Chen Zisheng, which resulted in a decision not to prosecute. On June 21 of this year, Wu Shaoqin falsely accused Wu Jiangshi of engaging in adultery with Chen Zisheng and filed a complaint with the Shanghai Municipal Police. The detective team of the police bureau dispatched officers to Wu Jiangshi's home at No. 246, Lane 2, Yangsi South Road, along with Wu Shaoqin, to search the premises, but they did not find any evidence of adultery between Wu Jiangshi and Chen Zisheng. Subsequently, Wu Jiangshi and Chen Zisheng filed separate lawsuits against Wu Shaoqin for false accusation. After investigation, it was found that the defendant and his wife, Wu Jiangshi, had a history of litigation due to the allocation of property and separate residence, which was on record. Furthermore, it was determined through investigation that there was no adultery between Wu Jiangshi and Chen Zisheng, and a decision not to prosecute was made and finalized. However, the defendant, harboring resentment towards Wu Jiangshi, fabricated accusations based on past events and filed a complaint with the Shanghai Municipal Police, which again found no evidence after a search. This clearly constitutes a deliberate false accusation and a violation of Article 169, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zongxing presided over the second criminal court hearing. The plaintiff, Chen Zisheng, filed an ancillary private prosecution, requesting that the full text of the verdict be published in the newspaper to restore his reputation, which had been damaged by rumors. The plaintiff, Wu Jiangshi, retained attorney Fang Junjie and filed an ancillary civil lawsuit, requesting: 1) compensation of 800 yuan for attorney fees; 2) publication of the verdict in the newspaper to restore her reputation; and 3) punishment of the defendant. When questioned, the defendant, Wu Shaoqin, testified that the matter of catching the adulterer was discussed with attorney Lu Dingkui, who introduced him to detectives Chen Weibang and a Mr. Jiang. They went to his wife's house, but there was no one there. He and his wife had separated in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China [1924]. Chen Zisheng is the grandfather of his eldest daughter's husband, but he did not officiate at the wedding. He insisted that there was adultery and claimed that his father and others were talking because his father was also not entirely proper. The official asked, "According to you, your parents, wife, and others are all bad, and you are the only good one. Is this all fabricated?" He replied, "No." The official then asked, "Did you write a letter demanding money?" He replied, "No." At this point, Chen Zisheng and Wu Jiangshi stated separately that their daughter married Chen's grandson, and the grandfather officiated at the wedding. Wu Shaoqin, using Chen's name, secretly took a large sum of money, causing a feud. He is not good to his parents, so why would he care about his wife? He has bad intentions and wants to extort money. There was a letter demanding money, which is now in the case file. The court ordered the summons of the detectives for further questioning. Wu Shaoqin was released on his original bail.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Changes Course Towards Sea of Japan</h3>
<p>Wind Direction Shifts from Northwest to Due North; Has Passed East of Luzon</p>
<p>The hurricane that originated from Guam Island in the Pacific Ocean had its wind direction changed from northwest to due north yesterday morning. At 6:00 AM, it had reached 22 degrees north latitude and 126 degrees east longitude, within a radius of 60 nautical miles. It has passed east of Luzon Island. If the direction of the hurricane remains unchanged, shifting from northwest to due north, it will likely move towards the Sea of Japan. The coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang in our country will be spared from its impact.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Protection of Maids Encouraged by League of Nations</h3>
<p>The Expert Advisory Committee on Slavery Issues of the League of Nations issued a report stating that the committee is greatly encouraged by the Shanghai Municipal Council's work in protecting maids. While formulating or implementing regulations regarding this work is difficult, the committee is confident that these difficulties can be overcome. The committee would be grateful if the Shanghai Municipal Council could submit a report by the end of the year and would be greatly interested in any news regarding maid shelters or relief centers.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Appoints Chairmen of Various Committees</h3>

<h3>Chen Jiufeng Convicted of Fraud and Sentenced</h3>
<p>Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment Yesterday; Wang Shuangcai and Others Sentenced to Detention</p>
<p>Chen Jiufeng, an Executive Committee member of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession and a Standing Committee member of the 39th District Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation, was suspected of illegally organizing a road workers' mutual aid society, collecting membership fees, and instigating Wang Shuangcai, Li Guilin, and Cui Yuliang to obstruct road work. The police arrested Chen along with Wang and the other three and prosecuted them in the First Special Court. The details of the trial have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Fengqi presided over the second criminal court hearing of this case. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, stated that the witness Zhu Lansheng, whom the court needed to summon, had been ordered by the police to be brought in, but Zhu had gone to Ningbo and was not in Shanghai, so he could not be brought to court today. When questioned, Wang Shuangcai, Li Guilin, and Cui Yuliang all denied obstructing road work or committing assault. Chen Jiufeng testified that the road workers' mutual aid society was not organized by him and that he was only one of the clerks of the society. He said that the workers joined the Citizens' Federation voluntarily because they could not bear the oppression of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The membership fees ranged from two jiao to twenty yuan, so the workers' payment of four jiao was in accordance with the rules of the society. Chen's defense lawyers, Chen Tingrui and Wang Jian'e, submitted an official letter from the Municipal Party Headquarters to prove that the road workers' mutual aid society was not organized by Chen Jiufeng. They also requested to summon four road workers who were present in court to prove Chen's relationship with the society. Judge Zhan examined the evidence and deemed it unnecessary to question the witnesses requested by Chen's lawyers. He ordered the commencement of the debate. However, Chen's lawyers argued that all evidence favorable to the defendant should be presented, but the court did not allow it. Chen's lawyers then requested the clerk to record the defendant's requests in the minutes. After mutual debate between the police lawyer, Jiang, and Chen's and Wang's lawyers, Wang Shuangcai, Li Guilin, and Cui Yuliang were sentenced to thirty-five days of detention each for jointly causing bodily harm, with the option of commuting the sentence to a fine of one yuan per day. Chen Jiufeng was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for repeatedly using fraudulent means to obtain property. The remaining charges were found not guilty. He was detained during the appeal period.</p>

<h3>Bankruptcy Administrator Accused of Debt Registration Dispute</h3>
<p>Defendant Claims It Was a Share Payment, Not a Debt; Files Counterclaim for One Yuan in Damages</p>
<p>Li Ding, the accountant and bankruptcy administrator of Jingfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory Co., Ltd., and the auditors, Zhou Baokang and Liu Huchen, have recently been sued in the First Special Court by Lu Jiasheng for criminal breach of trust. The details of their initial interrogation have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing presided over a renewed hearing of this case in the second criminal court. According to the plaintiff, Lu Jiasheng, he held a judgment document issued by the court in the 25th year of the Republic of China [1936] under case number Yi 1646, which had been finalized. He registered it with the defendant, Li Ding's accounting firm, according to the law, and a registration certificate was approved and issued. He then received consecutive notices to attend conciliation and creditors' meetings. Zhou and Liu were the bankruptcy auditors of Jingfeng. Unexpectedly, he then received a notice from Li Ding, stating that his debt of 500 yuan was not a deposit but a share payment and could not be registered as a debt and should be canceled. He immediately replied, stating that the defendants had no right to change the court's finalized legal judgment and demanding that they specify a date for payment within 24 hours. However, the defendants ignored him, which constitutes a violation of duty and a violation of Article 342 of the Criminal Law, and should be punished according to the law. He also filed an ancillary civil lawsuit, requesting an order to repay 200 yuan in national currency and statutory interest until the date of execution. When questioned, Li Ding testified that the registrar issued the registration certificate when the plaintiff came to his office to apply for registration. He did not see the judgment document. Later, based on the report of the creditor representative, which indicated that the plaintiff's payment was a share payment and not a debt, he sent a letter notifying the cancellation of the registration but asked him to provide further evidence. However, the plaintiff rashly filed a criminal lawsuit. Liu Huchen was absent. According to Zhou Baokang, the plaintiff's payment was a share payment and not a deposit. As the auditor, he naturally reported the facts. Now, the plaintiff can file a civil request for a ruling because the creditor's qualifications are in question. However, he rashly filed a criminal complaint, which constitutes false accusation. Therefore, he filed a counterclaim for false accusation and an ancillary civil lawsuit, requesting an order to compensate him and Liu Huchen for damages of one yuan each and to publish the verdict of this case in the newspaper. After debate between the lawyers of both parties, the court ordered the debate in this case to be concluded and set the pronouncement of the verdict for 9:00 AM on the 28th.</p>

<h3>Elucidation of "Respond to War"</h3>
<p>— Nai Yi</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in his second speech at the Lushan Talks, said that the development of the Lugou Bridge Incident is related to the entire issue of the Chinese nation, and whether this matter can be concluded is the realm of the final juncture." He also said, "If it comes to the final juncture, we can only stake the lives of the entire nation to seek the survival of the country. At that time, we will no longer be allowed to compromise halfway. We must know that the conditions for compromising halfway are the conditions for complete surrender and complete destruction. The most important thing for the people of the whole country is to recognize the meaning of the so-called final juncture. Once the final juncture arrives, we can only sacrifice to the end and resist to the end. Only by sacrificing to the end can we win the final victory. If we are hesitant and delusional about temporary peace, we will plunge the nation into an abyss of eternal doom!" And "From the course of this incident, we know how deliberately the other side is plotting against us, and peace cannot be easily obtained." Therefore, if we want peace and tranquility at present, we can only allow the other side's troops to enter and exit our territory without restriction, while our own troops must be restricted and unable to freely station themselves in our own territory, or if the other side's troops fire at the Chinese army, we cannot return fire. In other words, it is "others are the knife and chopping board, and we are the fish and meat." And in this way, we are about to reach this extremely tragic state in the world, which "no nation with even a little bit of personality in the world can endure!"</p>
<p>Such a solemn and resolute expression is what the people have been running around and calling for for several years. Once heard, it is no wonder that they are indescribably inspired and celebrate the day when shame will be avenged. However, it is unexpected that when those with blood and energy are just "happily listening to the national policy has been decided, and especially celebrating that the way to ask for service has been opened" (see Li Bai's telegram), the news comes that the "our own troops" in the Lugou Bridge and Wanping area have already been "withdrawing on orders"!</p>
<p>The reason why the North China authorities arbitrarily withdrew the troops of the 37th Division and replaced them with security teams is said to be "to express a peaceful resolution in order to promote the other side's enlightenment." "Enlightenment" and the need to "promote" it makes it impossible for the common people to fathom its profoundness, and when compared with the position expressed by the government, "the 29th Army cannot be subject to any restrictions in the area where it is now stationed," it is even more impossible not to suspect that the "eternal sinners" have a prior agreement! Otherwise, why withdraw troops!</p>
<p>However, what is the effect of the so-called "promoting the other side's enlightenment"? The Beijing dispatch in this newspaper on the 21st said: "When our security team went to Lugou Bridge to replace the defense, they saw that the Japanese army's surveillance was extremely aggressive. The Japanese army not only showed no signs of retreating, but also had a stubborn attitude..." It seems that this is probably another set of "others' troops enter and exit our territory without restriction, while our own troops are restricted and cannot freely station themselves" tricks. With this result, "peace and tranquility" is indeed "peace and tranquility," but what about "others are the knife and chopping board, and we are the fish and meat"!</p>
<p>And to test whether the Japanese side intends to provoke, one first withdraws one's own troops. This is also a very absurd behavior and excuse. "From the course of this incident, we know how deliberately the other side is plotting against us" has already been heard and digested. Do we really still need to test whether "today's Hebei-Chahar" will become "yesterday's Northeast provinces"?</p>
<p>We are indeed a weak country, but we must maintain the life of our nation, and we must bear the historical responsibility left to us by our ancestors. Therefore, when it is absolutely necessary, we must respond to war." Now, the "consistent" and "must defend with all our strength" "minimum" four-point position announced by the government has been damaged. Isn't this still "when it is absolutely necessary"? "The other side's troops enter and exit our territory without restriction," and even arrive limitlessly and build fortifications everywhere, and then bombard and shoot as they please. Isn't this again "when it is absolutely necessary"?</p>
<p>Otherwise, when will we "respond to war" again? And does the so-called "respond to war" mean another name for "only resist but not retaliate"?</p>
<p>Of course not!</p>
<p>Then, good, we will wait and see whether it is "compromise halfway" or "resist to the end." And the people will also decide their actions from this fork in the road.</p>

<h3>Peace? Enlightenment?</h3>
<p>— Warrior</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan, Shi Yousan, and others replied to the letter from the National Renaissance Association, "expressing their great determination regarding the North China incident, vowing to resist the enemy to the death, and not hesitating to make any sacrifice." This has already been seen in yesterday's newspapers. However, the Beijing dispatch on the 21st said, "The local authorities have consistently advocated a peaceful resolution to the Lugou Bridge Incident. On the morning of the 21st, they ordered the troops stationed in various places west and north of Lugou Bridge to temporarily retreat one or two li, and the defenses left behind will be successively taken over by Shi Yousan's security team. Cheng Xixian, the commander of the first brigade of the security team, led his troops to take over the defenses starting at 10:00 AM on the 21st. If the Japanese army does not attack our security team during the handover period, the handover can be completed by 12:00 PM. According to relevant sources, our side's advance withdrawal of troops this time is to demonstrate the ironclad evidence of peace and to promote the Japanese side's enlightenment. If the Japanese army still does not comply with the agreement to withdraw after our troops withdraw, their deliberate provocation will be seen by the whole world, and if the unfortunate incident expands, the responsibility should be borne by the Japanese side.</p>
<p>The Japanese's "deliberate provocation" has already been "seen by the whole world." Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also said in his second speech at the Lushan Talks, "Since the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, some people may think it was accidental, but in the past month, the other side's discussions or direct and indirect expressions in diplomacy have made us realize the signs of the incident, and before and after the incident, there were also various news spread, saying that they wanted to expand the scope of the Tanggu Agreement, to expand the pseudo-organization of eastern Hebei, to expel the 29th Army, and to force Ning Zheyuan to leave, such news is countless, it is conceivable that this incident is not accidental." Are the public officials of Hebei and Chahar, who are on the front line, still not clear? And let's look at another urgent telegram on the morning of the 22nd: "Our troops stationed in Babao Mountain withdrew at 7:20 PM on the 21st. When they withdrew, the Japanese army fired six more shells..." To continue to "demonstrate peace" and to continue to "promote the Japanese enlightenment" is to "hand over" the entire China...</p>
<p>Not only that, but this "compliance with the agreement to withdraw troops" also violates the will of the central government. I don't know whether the "agreement" complied with this time is verbal or written. Is it based on the will of the central government or the personal will of the public officials of Hebei and Chahar? The matter has reached the "final juncture. I hope the public officials of Hebei and Chahar will give us (450 million people) a clear indication. At the same time, I hope the central government will resolutely take the four points announced by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to resolve the Lugou Bridge incident as the basis for negotiations. Otherwise, there is only war! Anyone who "abandons even an inch of land and sovereignty" is "an eternal sinner of the Chinese nation!"</p>
<h3>Should Lending Stop?</h3>
<p>— Hu Yiang</p>
<p>Whether lending should stop has been clearly explained in the "Talks" on the 19th! "We know that the effect of consolation is more accurately said to be spiritual encouragement than material assistance, and the exchange of information with the anti-enemy brothers on the front line through a small amount of material media is even more precedented, then the donation movement can stop! What we want to express is precisely that outside of the limited number of brothers on the front line, there is still a unified public standing behind them, and the front line and the rear have already closely joined hands!" Now, Mr. Hu Yiang has put forward two more valuable opinions, which are published below:</p>
<p>(On the Road)</p>
<p>1.  It is easier to transport goods than to transport money. The first simple method, I think, is to change the "donation movement" to a "goods donation movement," that is, the rear public, who originally took "money" to comfort the soldiers on the front line, can change to "goods" to assist the soldiers on the front line, which seems more appropriate. For example, if the front line lacks a kind of poison gas protection tool, we can take out the money we are willing to donate to purchase poison gas protection tools. Also, if the front line needs medicines or food, we can also enthusiastically purchase and prepare a large number of applicable medicines or food at any time. However, in order to avoid supply and demand imbalance, we may as well allow the public to automatically purchase and donate any goods (limited to military necessities). One side should be transported and supported. One the other hand, a similar "People's Circles Transport Goods to Support Military Movement Committee" office should be jointly organized by local public organizations, and the duties it undertakes are to constantly communicate with the front line, find out what things are needed, and know how much is needed. Then, report to the public in the rear by various methods, and purchase and donate the required items on a specific day, collect them, and transport them to the front line. At the same time, if you want to make procurement convenient and practical, you can still maintain the donation method, just bulk purchase all the items required by the front line with all the donations. Then, although what the rear public directly donates is still "money," what Liu Qianfeng enjoys is already the appropriate "goods."</p>
<p>2.  The safekeeping and distribution of donations The second feasible method is that when the donation movement does not stop, if it is as above, you only need to easily purchase goods with money. However, this is only the use of part of the donations. We know that any extension or expansion of the war, what the army needs is definitely not only on the side of goods. According to past experiences, such as the treatment and burial of wounded and dead officers and soldiers, the aftermath of the families of dead officers and soldiers, the organization of rescue teams, and the organization of public military transportation teams, none of which are the responsibilities that the rear public should bear, and none of which can be helped without money. Therefore, the safekeeping and distribution of donations from all parties should be handled by a reliable office committee jointly formed by local public groups and personnel from the front line army to handle various urgent matters cautiously and fairly. Then, we can both avoid the unnecessary words "donations cannot reach the lower-level soldiers directly, etc." and remove the accidental malpractices caused by improper safekeeping and distribution of "consolation money."</p>
<p>Incidentally, we can choose one of the above two methods to handle the consolation donations that have been returned by the 29th Army.</p>
<h3>By the Iron Furnace</h3>
<p>— Rural Dweller</p>
<p>Those blacksmiths are truly punctual. As soon as the rice seedlings are planted, they arrive as promised. They arrived on the day of "Lesser Heat," a group of seven or eight. Furnace, anvil, bellows, awning, large and small iron hammers; these tools have followed them to countless docks and traveled countless journeys, exposed to sun and night dew, enduring the attacks of storms. However, they, like their masters, showed no signs of decline, weakness, or fatigue. The blacksmiths' sturdy bodies, hard chestnut-like arms, broad chests, thick eyebrows, and spirited eyes were full of a calm strength. The hall-sized furnace, the large "Fortune" character on the furnace, the heavy iron hammer, and the smooth wooden handle worn by friction on the hammer all gave people a sense of power. I stood at the factory gate, watching them and their tools enter the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>The ancestral hall became lively again. The men and women of the village all wanted to learn about the situation and news from other places from these travelers who came once a year, especially news about the foreign devils, believing that they were all northerners and the news must be plentiful and reliable. Everyone held their bowls of porridge and rice, surrounding the iron furnace, eating and listening, interjecting a few words whenever they had the chance. At first, they always talked about business and asked about prices. Everyone complained that farming tools were expensive this year. A four-pronged hoe cost five or six dimes, which had never happened before. "Alas, not to mention bean cake fertilizer, even iron tools are soaring in price. It's really hard to expect success from farming..." They all sighed like this.</p>
<p>Blacksmith boss Wang Laowu had such a straightforward temper: "Don't say that I, Laowu, am black-hearted and lack friendship. No matter how the price rises, it's not my turn to get rich. The foreign devils have ulterior motives and are causing trouble, sending people everywhere to buy copper and iron, even scrap iron. They offer high prices and buy as much as they can..."</p>
<p>The ignorant Third Granny interrupted and asked, "What kind of tools do they need so much iron to make? Do they use iron rakes, iron hoes, and sickles for farming?"</p>
<p>"...Don't even mention that! They use it all to make cannons and bombs. After they started buying, the price of iron suddenly became expensive. It's not like I'm raising the price just for the sake of it. The cost is too high. What else can I do but do business at a loss? I can't support two wives, hehehe..."</p>
<p>These words made everyone burst into laughter. When the laughter subsided, Lao Long, the man with a full beard in the third room, leaned against the door frame and said seriously, "The Chinese are so spineless, selling iron to the foreign devils, letting them make guns and cannons to kill us, to bomb our cities and houses. It's not that I, Lao Long, am stubborn, but even if the foreign devils used gold to exchange for my old ironware, I would definitely embarrass them." He raised his fist.</p>
<p>Donggua, who was perched on a long bench sharpening a knife blade, turned to look at Lao Long: "The foreign devils aren't as sincere as you, coming out to collect iron in person. There are always those who swallow arsenic with their eyes closed, those conscienceless people, helping them. Their eyes are only fixed on bright, stinky money, with no ancestors, no descendants, acting as spies everywhere. They do things that others can't do. Not to mention helping the foreign devils buy iron, they even turn around and kill their own Chinese people. How can you defend against that? What if I were a spy, coming here to ask for directions, who would know!"</p>
<p>"If you were a spy, damn it, I would have beaten you flat long ago!" The long-necked blacksmith raised a large iron hammer and slammed it hard in the air above the anvil. The sound of iron hitting iron burst out sparks. The long-necked blacksmith gritted his teeth, as if he were really hitting a spy. That appearance again caused everyone to laugh. Donggua had become the target of everyone's criticism, truly like a spy. Some reached out to pat his bald head: "Let's all beat the spy!" Even the children excitedly gathered around.</p>
<p>"This is really no laughing matter. If the Chinese want to live upright lives, they must drive out the foreign devils and kill the spies. They have good artillery and powerful weapons, but when they see the big knife team, they are scared out of their wits. They are really spineless, running away and begging for mercy. This ugly state makes people feel disgusted. In this situation, there's no way to make a living by making iron tools. It's better to simply make big knives and let the soldiers kill a few more foreign devils, letting them know that the Chinese are not weaklings and are afraid of death. If you want to stand out, you have to fight!" The more Wang Laowu spoke, the more energetic he became, spraying saliva. The molten fire in the iron furnace shone on his sturdy muscles, emitting a glow of strength. I was almost moved to shout wildly.</p>
