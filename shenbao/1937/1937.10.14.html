<h3>美决與九國公約簽字國通力合作解决中日糾紛</h3>
<p>羅斯福表示願努力謀求世界和平　消弭戰禍保全文明不容置身事外　基本道德不受尊重各國同蒙其害</p>
<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福總統今晚以無綫電向全國民衆廣播其“爐邊閒談、”宣稱、美國將出席九國公約會議、並與簽訂該約之中日等國盡力合作、以謀解决目前中國之局勢、總統力稱、美國願為世界和平有所舉動、其語氣較諸上星期在　芝加哥之演說、更為强硬、總統云、“予願吾美偉大之民主國家、能領悟避免戰爭、不在乎不聞不問蓋世界和平、必須積極努力、始能實現、並非默然希求、翹首期待、卽能達到目的也、至於九國公約會議之宗旨、則為設法以各國共同之意見、解決中國之問題、美國為努力求得解决方法起見、甚願與中國日本及其他簽字國家盡力合作、此種互相合作之精神、當可為謀求世界和平者楷模、現在舉世皆有毀滅文化建設之現象、美國詎能漢不關心、故美國之盡力於保全和平及世界文明、卽欲保全美國之文明、使其繼續發皇、並得與其他文明民族之成就、互相切磋也、君等猶憶一九一三年至一九二一年間之情形乎、予對於當時之世界大局、頗為接近、且亦深知孰者可行、孰者不可行矣、總統最後數語、蓋預知有人將要求美國保守更嚴格之中立、故先聲奪人云、總統論及世界大勢之處、為其“爐邊閒談”最後之一部、其先論及國內情形之時、亦屢以世界和平之影響為重、例如“吾人雖力謀提高美國人民之生活程度、然亦當知此等計劃、或將因國外之情形而大受影響、“倘美國境外戰禍遍地、則國際貿易何能維持、”“故世界各國應各守若干根本信條、苟有違背、即將損及全世界之福利”云云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福總統已於今晨八時二十五分抵海德公園故居憩息數日、據一般人解釋其“爐邊閒談”云、美國參加九國公約會議、係為和平而非為戰爭、但總統亦明白表示美國對於日本或可施行經濟制裁、或抵制日貨云、（十三日國民電）</p>

<p>蕰藻浜南岸敵軍、以一師團以上之兵力、藉飛機大砲及其他機械化部隊之掩護、大舉進犯我陣地、企圖突破我大塲南翔綫、以達其速戰速决目的、敵自上月十九日下令五次總攻、迭遭我軍迎頭痛擊、乃竭全力作最後之掙扎、一度被其突進三公里、經我軍增援反攻、左右出奇包抄、敵倉皇失措、狼狽潰退江邊、是役敵傷亡在三千人以上、截獲戰利品無算、誠為滬戰以來空前大捷、敵五次總攻、至是又告一結束、而突破我大塲南翔之計劃、顯已受最嚴重之打擊矣、敵發言人昨亦承認蕰藻浜南岸無發展、且謂九日迄今、並無劇戰、此種欲蓋彌彰之掩飾、不祇自畫大敗供狀、敵軍現困守黑大黃宅·八房宅·楊宅·趙家宅·一帶、堀壕深伏、巳無再犯能力　我軍三面包圍、乘勝還擊、昨晚陣綫、續有進展、浜邊殘敵日內當可全部肅淸、至廣福鎮以北·戰事比較沉寂、我軍扼守原陣綫、敵絕不能越雷池一步·閘北方面、昨晚劇烈砲戰後、敵分路乘機進犯、我軍沉着應戰、一時機關槍·步槍·小鋼砲·手溜彈·聲雜作、敵傷亡枕藉、先後被擊退、午夜後、戰事停止、我陣綫不動、</p>

<h3>日機有意射擊英武官英國極為憤慨</h3>
<p>準備對日嚴重抗議　日當局猶企圖諉責</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於英駐華大使館汽車三輛、被日本飛機在閔行附近故意加以轟炸一節、此間輿論極為憤慨、英政府凖備向東京提出强烈抗議、“每日快報”今日刋載長文一篇、論述此事、力言英政府認為此項事件、異常嚴重、“每日郵訊報申稱、如此種事件尚可容忍、則歐洲尚有何望云、（十三日海通電）</p>
<p>［東京］此間各報對於日空軍轟炸英國駐華使館汽車一事、表示扼腕、認為縱使此項車件、可望於短期內解决、但英日邦交必將大受影響、倫敦某大銀行之拒絕接受日本匯票、及紐蘭政府之禁止碎鐵輸往日本、使東士大感不安、政界方面認為如英日邦交日趨惡劣、則日本對中國海岸之封鎖、將益趨嚴厲云、（十三日海通電）</p>
<p>［南京］敵機在閔行馬橋掃射英使館航空副武官馬瑞等及蘇聯大使館秘書沙霍夫沙事、據悉英大使館賀武决以鄭重之語答覆訪者、謂馬瑞等行前曾通知日方、英使對此事、正從事調查、并將情形電告倫敦、另據蘇聯使館息沙霍夫沙是日原係由滬來京、因車在途中損壞、遇英使館武官汽車、當卽塔車返滬、今日此間蘇聯使館曾以電話向沙霍夫詢問經過、卽轉電莫斯科報告、使館對此事、現不欲有所發表、（十三日專電）</p>
<p>西報詳紀出事眞相</p>
<p>大陸報云、昨日（十二日）下午、本埠戰區中復發生一國際不幸事件日飛機六架、飛於閔行附近、竟開機關槍射擊由南京來滬之私人汽車三輛、車中乘者、其主要人物為英大使署航空上尉馬瑞、與航空事務處職員一人、意大使署海軍上尉阿爾白齊、蘇聯大使署武官之秘書沙賀夫、聞兩車屬於英大使署、另一車為上海美商美通福特汽車公司所有、共載英人三、意人一、日耳曼種俄人一、其人名斐汀賀夫、爲駕駛美公司之汽車、（據上海泰晤士報載稱、其人乃美通公司南京分公司經理、）又華人二、雖有一彈穿過美公司汽車之頂、馬瑞上尉之汽車亦擊碎玻璃窗面、但乘者七人、幸無一人受傷、斐氏所駕之車最先行、下午四時左右、甫離閔行、即見日飛機六架、飛於大空　意圖施擊、斐氏即停車、而與同車華報館訪員某氏自車中躍入道旁小浜繼由浜中爬入稱田、後隨英大使署之汽車二輛、亦即停車、幸賴諸人機警、乃免受傷、或遭非命、日機向車開機關槍後、即飛去、而諸人衣服盡濕、滿身皆泥、復登汽車、急駛至滬、日機參加施擊者、其確數尚未查明、一或謂四機向車突下、兩機則翺翔高空、其突下之機、飛行甚低、駕機員明白可見、英大使署之兩車、於車頂鋪有英旗、雖已確悉、美公司之汽車、是否携有美族、昨夜尚未探悉、因駕車之俄人斐氏到滬後、急欲入浴易衣、未及細談也、至車中有蘇聯大使署職員沙賀夫同行者純出偶然、沙氏於昨日侵晨駕自備之汽車出滬入京、上午七時　駛至距閔行南七哩處、因車損、乃步行回閔　但直至下午三時、始能與本埠蘇俄當局接通電話、請派一車、將其車拖回上海、敵英大使署之汽車駛過閔行、沙氏乃向馬瑞上尉述明一切、承兀載之返滬、本埠蘇聯總領事署接沙氏電話後、即遣　車開往閔行、不意在下午四時十五分左右、甫出法租界四五哩、亦遭日飛機以機關槍射擊、現信開槍者即十五分鐘前射擊英大使署汽車之日機、駕車者曾停車避入林中、其人屬何國籍、未悉、</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報亦紀載此事、謂被擊者爲英大使署之汽車二輛、又行李車一輛皆由英國陸軍駕車員駕駛、車中乘者共有四英人　除國內外著名之英國航空員英大使署皇家空軍武官馬瑞上尉外、為前供職中國鐵路局之倫敦白萊漢氏、怡和公司之興登氏、又馬沙爾氏、馬瑞上尉所乘之汽車、中彈數枚、擋風之玻璃窗、亦被擊碎、</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、星期二日下午日飛機以機關槍射擊英大使署汽東一案、本埠英當局現扔在調查眞相、故迄未發表正式言論、據非官塲消息、英大使署汽車愼循照會中所開之路綫駛行、並踐行豫先商妥之各項條件、此行共汽車三輛、其一為美涌福特汽東公司所有　車頂曾中機關槍彈、其藍色之背身、漆成長四呎廣五呎之英旗、並未如日方所稱、車身黃色大似中國軍用汽車、日飛機當時飛行甚低、定能瞭見諸汽車頂上之標識、航空上尉馬瑞當時若非迅速躍入道旁溝中、則其生侖恐不可保、因其所乘汽車之擋風玻璃、已經擊碎也、而今日日軍發言人接見外報訪員時、猶加强辯、謂三汽車非循所開之路綫行駛、此案現由駐滬英總領事署從事調查、因英大使署駐滬辦公處人員不足、不能擔任其事、且須與倫敦交換電報、必需時多日也、本埠英員當日接訊後、即於下午五時前舉行會議、日領事人員今晨曾至英總領事署、英員亦為是案訪問日員數次、英總領事署人員今日曾全晨會商、下午似未必在報紙發表文告、蘇聯總領事署僅承認其大使署職員沙賀氏因同車遇險、此外未發任何言論、滬人士今極關心英國報紙對是案之反響、英國民衆之抵制日貨運動、現正積極進行、或將因此更形努务也、</p>

<p>車窗中彈</p>
<p>該機降至三百呎時、即停止發槍、馬瑞即奔至四十碼外、避於樹下、第三機並未降下、馬瑞在樹下見尚有三機、亦降下開槍、而另三機則留高空約五分鐘至十分鐘後、諸機結集成隊、向上海飛去、大者在前、小者在後、迨機離去、馬瑞即回至車上、見車窗中有一彈、附近路上、則落彈尤多云、末並稱、被襲擊之兩事、頂上均漆有英國國徽、而行駛在前之另一車、則僅懸一旗、而未及舖展於車頂、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>這篇賬須從頭算起</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>日本違反了九國公約。公然侵略我國的領土。已有六年餘的歷史了。可是英美等國。直到現在方才着急起來。要召集會議來清算這一篇賬。這不消說是很不容易的。</p>
<p>我們唯一的要求是這篇賬從頭算起。我國必須恢復九一八以前完整的領土。而日本從九一八以來在我國境內用武力所造成的一切卽成事實。也必須完全推翻。</p>
<p>至於日本。現在全國受着軍部勢力的控制。在我們二百萬軍隊沒有把日本軍人的狂暴氣燄根本撲滅以前。要單靠外交的壓力。使日本接受任何程度的清算辦法。當然也極難。</p>
<p>然而遠東有關的列强。尤其是英美。是可能採取有效的手段來。算這篇賬的。所謂有效的手段。第一是經濟制裁。第二是武力制裁。武力制裁的效力不消說。經濟制裁的效力也極强。因為日本的戰爭機構。始終是非依賴英美（如軍火原料等）不可的。</p>
<p>我想英美兩國的政治領袖旣己毅然宣告了維持公約尊嚴的决心。對於這等有效的手段。一定是多少有些準備的。他們現在所考慮的。無非是從矛盾複雜的國際關係中間。怎樣蕁求實施的途徑罷了。</p>

<h3>在轟炸中来去</h3>
<p>— 郭沫若</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>回到首都飯店，和淳如分了手，我自己便往第××軍後方辦事處去訪問葉劍英。葉是北伐時代的老友，我和他的契闊也整整地十年了，最後一次的聚首，記得是民十六年八月初頭的一夜，是在九江的一隻湖船上。湖，大約是甘棠湖吧，因爲是沒有月的夜。四面都很朦朧。我只記得湖中四處有菱浮汎，我自己還把菱㧞起來，剝食過幾粒新鮮的菱角。同船的，記得有陽翰笙，有李德謨，似乎還有梅龔彬，但當夜所談的話已就和那夜景一樣，全完朦朧了。</p>
<p>在一間陳設很簡單的狹小的會客室裏會見了劍英，他的丰貌仍和十年前相差不遠，只是眼睛更有光彩，但不知怎的，總覺得表情有點寂寞。這大約是由於他是善戰的勇將，他的背境應該是幾萬大兵，而不應該是幾張梭發吧？</p>
<p>問了些陝北方面的朋友們的消息，也問了些住在首都的朋友們的地址，接着我又分頭去開始了我的個別訪問。</p>
<p>最先去訪問了陳立夫先生和邵力子先生，立夫先生不在，力子先生也不在。我曉得他們是很忙的，便各留了一張字條，告訴了我住的地方，並請求指定時間和地點，以便再往候敎。</p>
<p>其次是訪問了李應潮先生，這次是會着了。由應潮的轉告，才知道陳眞如也住在首都××。因此我從應潮那兒告辭了出來之後，便連忙地趕回旅邸。</p>
<p>但是，眞如出去了。</p>
<p>我躊躇了起來，想去訪問多年不見的田漢。但我不知道他住的地方。我知道只要打電話到新民報館去探問便可以問明，但那報館裏面我有很多的熟人，假如他們一知道我到了南京，立地便會在報上登出來，這是使我有點惶惑的。自己的名字在報上看見時，不知怎的，連自己都覺得有幾分憎恨。這怕是在日本過了十年的退攖生活所養出的情緖吧。日本的新聞記者，他們實在是做到了“無冕王的”地位，他們的一枝筆充分地可以生殺人。連日本人也都害怕他們，覺得他們比“刑事”（包探）還要可怕。</p>
<p>又想到傅抱石。這是一位擅塲篆刻的天才，他能刻細字，於方寸之內刻列萬言，圖畫也相當出色。我是在日本認識他的。他有一個時期在留學生監督處充書記，月領薪水六十元，一面工作，一面苦讀，而且還要寄錢回國養家。他那堅苦卓絕的精神我也是佩服的。我知道他在中山大學藝術科担任敎席，便呌人打電話到中大去問，但却沒有問出一個結果。</p>
<p>怎麽辦呢？正在躊躇的時候，電話來了，是眞如打來的。他又得到應潮的轉告，知道了我住的地方。他約我到某處去和他同吃晚飯。</p>
<p>—是的，這倒是一件大問題，吃晚飯！我的斷食了一整天的肚子，這樣告訴我說。</p>
<p>眞如比北伐時更健康了。</p>

<h3>隨軍日記（六）</h3>
<p>— 中央社特派隨軍記者陳萬里</p>
<p>十月十二日</p>
<p>早晨醒來的時候、天又在下着微雨、可是不久就雨過大青、陽光普照了、</p>
<p>今天敵機在閘北一帶猛烈地轟炸、然而結果呢、敵人也祇徒耗彈藥而已、我們却沒有什麽損害、</p>
<p>戰事在各綫展開、而激戰還在蕰藻浜的南岸進行、在五日的晚間和六日的早晨、蕰藻浜北岸的敵人、先後在猛烈的砲火之下強渡敵人付了重大的代價、得以強渡成功而到達南岸者、共計有三個地方、直到現在、滬太公路以東的兩處渡河的敵人　　經過了我們不斷的圍剿、大部都已消滅、只是滬太公路以西的黑大黃宅·八房宅·和周宅·一帶、還是敵人主力之所在、也是現在戰事的重心之所在、敵人的野心很大、企圖從這裹實現、他們中央突破的戰略、可是終於在今天、展開了主力戰、而遭受了重大的創傷、</p>
<p>滬太公路以西的渡河之敵、曾於九日東進、企圖攻擊我們廟行和江湾的駐軍之背、可是結果是失敗了、昨天敵人改向西進、企圖直趨南翔、可是結果又失敗了、今日拂曉、敵人又集中了主力、猛力南衝、企圖越大塲而進取眞如、完成其大包圍之形勢、可是結果呢還是失敗了、</p>
<p>大隊的敵人、在今日的拂曉、以密集的砲火為掩護、猛力南衝、我們乘勢誘敵深入、直到上午九時許、敵人已深入到了大塲之後、於是我們正面的部隊立即開始反攻、左右的部隊、也就猛烈夾擊、敵人處於三面圍剿之中、已經失去了逃潰的時間和空間、全部給我們殲滅、這次血戰、一直繼續到了晚上、我們已把殘敵壓逼退至河邊、</p>
<p>這也許就是敵軍總司令松井大將之所謂“轟破華軍抵抗力”的總攻吧、但是只成了敵人第四次總攻的尾聲了、現在呢、蕰藻浜河邊敵人、巳經完全在我們的控制之下、絲毫沒有反攻的能力了、這是我們在敵人第四次總攻期中所得到的最大的勝利、</p>
<p>記起蕰藻浜北岸東楊宅的敵人、在六日上午波河、當晚經我軍冒雨猛烈反攻、擊斃了敵人、達二百餘人、其中有一個是小塚少尉、隸屬於敵步兵第一○一聯隊第十二中隊的、同時還獲得阿部部隊的隊旗及其他戰利品甚多、這些東西、都已呈繳到了這裏、今天給一位幸運的攝影師收進了鏡頭、大約不久就可以在銀幕上見到、</p>
<p>我也是幸運的一個、今天在這裏看到了這些戰利品、計有阿部部隊的隊旗一面、及日本人民贈送的日章旗四面、上面都寫着“萬歲”“百鍊之鐵”·“義軍奉公”·“武運長久”·等字樣、可憐“武運”是“不久”了、這些旗幟都已成了我們的戰利品</p>
<p>此外還有日記兩本、命令袋一只、人名錄一本、和上海市法華鎮等地圖三張、這些地國、是“上海派遣軍司令”“陸地測量部”和“參謀本部”印的可以說是詳盡到了極點、在這裏也可以看到敵人對於侵略淞滬的準備很久了、</p>
<p>最奇怪的、是還獲得“步兵操典”·“戰鬥綱要”·“陣中要務令”·“步兵射擊殺範”·和“出動軍下士官兵衛生心得”·各一册、在戰壕裹看“衛生心得”、已屬奇蹟、到了火綫上還要讀“步兵操典”·“戰鬥綱要”·和“射擊教範”·這些書、豈不笑話、我這個疑問終於發問了、經過了一位剛從日本考察歸來的少年高級軍官的解釋、我才恍然大悟、原來這些官兵都是新召入伍的、所以雖然巳經上了火綫、還要讀這些“戰鬥綱要”·和“射擊教範”之類的書籍、大約是冀圖找一些得以“生還東京”之道吧、可憐這些日本的國民、也許還沒有讀完綱要教範、却已經在軍閥的驅使之下、毫無意義地在異國犧牲了、連骸骨都不得運還祖國、</p>

<p>我砲轟北四川路斃敵百餘人　廣東街我軍衝鋒敵紛紛潰敗　羅店敵軍蠢然思動被我堵擊</p>
<p>敵軍於十二日傾全力向我塘橋以北滬太公路西面左翼陣地企圖中央突擊、雖一度深入、被我三路夾攻、敵傷亡六千餘衆、仍被迫竄匿黑大黃宅一帶浜邊、勢孤力蹙、已無能為力、敵乃轉移目光、向我右翼侵犯、由嚴家灣圖窺我廟行、另一路則由泗涇球場犯我江灣陣地、昨竟日激戰不已、敵終不支而退、入晚在嚴家灣方面之敵再向我曹家宅進犯、經我奮勇抵抗、敵仍未得逞、閘北方面、昨晚起、敵自虬江支路向我寶山路猛攻、激戰通宵、今晨拂曉起、敵機繼續出動、濫施轟炸、威脅我軍、以助其步兵前進、但我軍鎮靜異常沉着應戰、陣地安若泰山、敵卒無機可乘、羅店方面、昨晚有敵軍一聯隊之衆、向朱家宅猛犯未逞、江灣方面、昨夜今晨無激戰、</p>
<p>確息、十三日夜間、閘北一帶及大場激戰未停、重砲迫擊砲機關槍及步槍聲傳來不絕、浦江沿岸亦有機關槍聲、密如連珠、乍浦路（靠近蓬路及靶子路）及吳淞路海甯路等處、落下砲彈甚多、今晨六時至十時間、寶山路商務印書館附近、砲戰頗烈、橫浜橋一帶機關槍聲甚密、八時許、敵機在北站西南約四分之一英里處、沿鐵路綫轟炸我軍開高射砲射擊、同時浦江中有小艇滿載敵軍、與陸家嘴方面之我軍開槍互擊、敵艦亦發砲、至九時始停、麥根路車站東面及東北面之中興路一帶、有敵機投擲炸彈、北四川路靶子路口常有砲彈墜落、</p>
<p>我軍事機關得報、敵方傳出消息、敵軍對羅店·劉行·顧家宅·唐橋等陣地、雖以全力進攻、卒無進展、故刻以全力向唐橋浜南進攻、以期佔據大塲、牽制閘北、現敵軍司令部、業已嚴令江灣·唐橋兩地進攻軍隊、限於本月十五日（卽明日）前、佔據大塲云、此項陰謀、早為我方洞悉、故戒備嚴密、早具迎頭痛擊之决心、</p>

<h3>蕰藻浜南殘敵頑抗</h3>

<p>今晨（十四日）七時半原二號浮筒出雲艦附近之敵小輪一艘、突內駛陸家嘴浦面、將纜繫於浮筒後、卽以機槍向我浦東猛烈掃射、我浦東守軍遂以步槍還擊、敵輪兵士見我早有凖備、除紛紛匍伏輪中外、另由一人匍行至船首解纜後、於向外逃避時、尚頻頻反搖機槍、向陸射擊、此時停泊三菱碼頭之敵二十一號驅逐艦、卽以平射砲向陸家嘴一帶猛肆轟擊、每分鐘一砲、先後轟擊達四十餘分鐘之久、一時隆隆之聲、雜以拍拍之機槍聲、震驚遐邇、九時二十分、原先逃避之敵輪、復又駛回陸家嘴面、再以機槍向我掃射、我駐軍亳不之理、敵後以望遠鏡遙窺許久、但終無傍岸勇氣、該輪遂又怏怏向外駛去、</p>
<h3>南市浦東均遭空襲</h3>
<p>開槍掃射並發荒謬傳單</p>
<p>敵巨型機三架、於今晨九時盤旋於南市一帶、而在南車站上低飛偵察、並以機槍掃射、有五分鐘之久、幸南車站早無搭客、故無傷害、旋敵機又飛至高昌廟斜橋一帶、擲下荒謬傳單、語多誘惑、但民衆均紛紛扯去、絕不一顧、該項敵機、一直往西飛至滬西北新涇虹橋路羅別根路一帶轟炸、並又在滬南斜士路漕河涇方面開槍掃射、在土山灣相近、曾見投下一巨彈、其聲甚巨、在南市之市民咸疑為附近市上被炸、故曾一度紛亂、但事後調査、該彈係落在田野之內、並無損害、</p>
<p>今晨九時許、敵機二架又飛至浦東白蓮涇及滬南滬閔路等處窺察、並不時以機關槍向下亂射、歷半小時、始折東北飛去、嗣沿途在浦東亦開機關槍掃射、</p>

<h3>閘北今晨有激戰</h3>
<p>廣束街我浴血衝鋒　飛機大砲不斷轟炸　路局大廈被毀一角</p>
<p>中央社閘北隨軍記者昨日午一時二十分報吿、淸晨五時起、敵機二十餘架、卽在閘北上空活動、其所投炸彈、較昨尤多、其轟炸目標、仍為潭子灣·共和路·寶山路·東寶興路一帶據觀察敵在此綫將有活動、大戰將於日內開展、又江灣路屈家橋方面、亦有敵戰車多輛、屢向八字橋水電路駛來窺探、足徵敵將有大規模之進攻、但我軍已嚴密警戒、</p>
<p>今晨閘北激戰不已</p>
<p>十四日侵晨起、閘北八字橋·日本墳山·六三花園·江灣路·敵海軍陸戰隊司令部、及沿北四川路一帶、各處敵步兵、均斷續不已向我軍陣地侵擾、小鋼砲頻頻作聲、機關槍軋軋不停、我軍皆沉着應戰、俟敵接近時、乃出壕用手溜彈機關槍等回擊、敵颇受挫折、直至午刻尚在激戰不已、且敵兵常用大砲轟我民房、我軍在敵機猛烈轟炸下、沉着應戰、不顧一切、</p>
<p>我軍推向北四川路</p>
<p>中央社閘北隨軍記者十四日午十二時十五分報吿、今晨二時許、我軍在月色朦朧中、由廣東街方面進襲、敵前哨經我肅淸後、據各巷口向北四川路猛攻、大隊敵軍馳来抵禦、卽发生激戰、我軍冒彈雨衝出、與敵肉搏多次、頗佔優勢、佔有通北四川路之街衢、與敵巷戰約三小時、繼續向北四川路推進中、</p>
<p>飛機大砲轟炸閘北</p>
<p>中央社閘北隨軍記者十四日晨一時零五分報吿、敵機二十餘架、昨全日在閘北上空盤旋窺察、更番投彈、而敵軍大砲更不斷轟擊、其情形較兩日兩來尤為猛烈、巍然獨立之路局大厦、亦在東西北三邊各中一彈、炸燬一角、至其他民房、被燬者則尤不少、</p>
<p>今晨六時許起、又有大批敵機分三架一隊、在閘北西北沿滬太汽車路之彭浦新橋·彭浦汽車站·大塲鎭一帶、分途投彈、八時後、則敵機三架一隊或兩隊併成一隊、乍離乍合、在閘北各處肆行投擲重彈轟炸、每次落彈時至少三四枚、或八九枚不等、以故轟降轟隆之聲、震及全滬、公共租界沿蘇州河之新閘路·北京路、敵機每次投彈時、屋宇皆震動、玻璃窗均格格作聲、間用槍機掃射、</p>
<p>我高射砲發揮威力</p>
<p>敵因犯我左翼不逞、乃連日改變策略、向我閘北各綫進犯、並以飛機大砲濫施轟炸、然我已早有預備、敵雖以全力來犯、卒受重創而退、我軍事當局除在各綫加强兵力外、復充實空防實力、配備最新式之防空武器、故今晨敵機三架侵入我閘北防地時、防空部隊立卽以高射砲及高射機槍射擊、敵機雖往來翱翔天空、其飛度恒在萬公尺以上、每遇我高射砲放射時、集結之三機、卽立時分開、更不敢逼近、我空防陣綫、故敵機雖仍繼續活動、然已不若數日前之猖獗、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>日本發言人謂。日本對華用兵。實出於自衛。羅斯福之談話。美政府之宣言。謂其認識不足。是何言歟。夫所謂自衛云者。自衛其土地也。自衛其主權也。自衛其人民與財產也。今敵人旣侵略我華北。又强佔我淞滬。而云自衛。不知自衛二字作何種解說也。豈敵人解釋自衛二字。與世界特殊乎。</p>
<p>敵人侵路我華北。又强佔我淞滬。而云自衛。則我國此次抗戰當作若何解說耶。羅斯福之談話美政府之宣言。眞深得自衛之精神者也。倘世界均若日本之强辭奪理盡成國際强盜。則美國豈能抱孤立政策。而獨享安樂。故羅斯福總統前夕發表爐邊談話。謂基本道德。不受尊重各國將同蒙其害。消弭戰禍。保全文明。不容置身事外。此語深得自衛二字之正解者也。</p>

<p>德國人民，工人占百分之六十强，務農者實居少數。而開墾荒地，開河築路，在在需人，於是規定高中畢業生必須服務半年，然後方可升入大學或從事社會職務。至服務範圍，男子则開河築路墾殖，女子則恊助農人管理小孩，種植蔬菜。施行結果，若輩均能勝任愉快，工作效率極高。</p>
<p>德人生活，在“開源節流”，大量生產，節制消耗。現正以科學方法，凖備儲藏糧食，籍爲將來之需。一般民衆，皆節衣縮食。全國提倡以馬鈴薯（俗稱洋山芋）充飢，因馬鈴薯生長極速，月隨處可植，而滋養料尤極豐富。</p>
<p>若堅苦卓絕雄心奮發之德國人民，宜其爲世人所注意焉。</p>

<h3>US Decides to Cooperate with Signatory Nations of the Nine-Power Treaty to Resolve the Sino-Japanese Conflict</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Expresses Willingness to Strive for World Peace, Eliminating Warfare and Preserving Civilization, Cannot Remain Aloof; Basic Morality Not Respected, All Nations Suffer Alike</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt, in his "Fireside Chat" broadcast to the nation tonight, declared that the United States will attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and cooperate with China, Japan, and other signatories to the treaty to resolve the current situation in China. The President stressed that the United States is willing to take action for world peace, his tone even stronger than in his speech in Chicago last week. The President said, "I hope that our great democratic nation of America can realize that avoiding war does not mean turning a blind eye. World peace must be actively pursued to be realized, and cannot be achieved by silently hoping and waiting." As for the purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it is to find a way to resolve the problem of China with the common opinion of all countries. In order to strive for a solution, the United States is very willing to cooperate with China, Japan, and other signatory countries. This spirit of mutual cooperation can serve as a model for those seeking world peace. Now there is a phenomenon of destroying cultural construction all over the world. How can the United States not care? Therefore, the United States' efforts to preserve peace and world civilization are to preserve the civilization of the United States, so that it can continue to flourish and learn from the achievements of other civilized nations. Do you remember the situation between 1913 and 1921? I was very close to the world situation at that time, and I also knew what was feasible and what was not." The President's last few words were to preemptively address those who would demand that the United States maintain stricter neutrality. The President discussed the world situation as the last part of his "Fireside Chat." When he first discussed the domestic situation, he repeatedly emphasized the impact of world peace, for example, "Although we are striving to improve the living standards of the American people, we must also know that these plans may be greatly affected by the situation abroad. "If the scourge of war is all over the world outside the United States, how can international trade be maintained?" "Therefore, all countries in the world should abide by some fundamental creeds, and if there is any violation, it will harm the welfare of the whole world," etc. (National Telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt arrived at his Hyde Park home at 8:25 this morning to rest for a few days. According to general interpretation of his "Fireside Chat," the United States is participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference for peace, not for war, but the President also made it clear that the United States may impose economic sanctions on Japan or boycott Japanese goods.

<h3>Enemy Forces Suffer Severe Blows After a Miserable Defeat on the South Bank of the Wenzaobang Creek</h3>
<p>The Central Breakthrough Plan Comes to Naught; Our Encirclement and Attack on the Remaining Enemy by the Creek Progresses Considerably; Our Forces on Xiangyin Road Press Towards the Yejia Garden; The Enemy's Attempt to Invade Miaohang is Foiled by Our Discovery</p>
<p>The enemy forces on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Creek, with the strength of more than one division, launched a large-scale attack on our positions under the cover of aircraft, artillery, and other mechanized units, attempting to break through our Dachang-Nanxiang line in order to achieve their goal of a quick victory. Since the 19th of last month, the enemy has ordered five general offensives, which have been met with fierce counterattacks by our army. They exhausted all their efforts to make a final struggle, and once broke through three kilometers. After our army reinforced and counterattacked, making a surprise encirclement from the left and right, the enemy was in a state of panic and retreated in a disastrous defeat to the riverbank. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than 3,000 casualties, and countless spoils of war were seized, truly an unprecedented victory since the Battle of Shanghai. The enemy's five general offensives have thus come to an end again, and the plan to break through our Dachang-Nanxiang line has obviously suffered the most serious blow. The enemy spokesman also admitted yesterday that there was no development on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Creek, and said that there had been no fierce battles since the 9th. This kind of cover-up that attempts to hide the truth is not only a self-portrait of a great defeat. The enemy forces are now trapped in the area of the Hei Dahuang Residence, the Bafang Residence, the Yang Residence, and the Zhao Family Residence, digging deep trenches and hiding, and have no ability to attack again. Our army is encircling from three sides and counterattacking victoriously. Last night, the front line continued to make progress. The remaining enemy by the creek can be completely cleared within days. As for the area north of Guangfu Town, the fighting is relatively quiet. Our army is guarding the original front line, and the enemy will never be able to cross the Lei Chi pool even one step. On the Zhabei side, after a fierce artillery battle last night, the enemy launched attacks in several directions, taking advantage of the opportunity. Our army responded calmly. For a time, machine guns, rifles, small mortars, and hand grenades sounded together. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and was repelled one after another. After midnight, the fighting stopped, and our front line remained unmoved.</p>
<h3>Our Army Achieves Considerable Success in Encircling and Attacking the Remaining Enemy on the South Bank of the Wenzaobang Creek</h3>
<p>The Remnants of the Enemy Army are Hidden in Trenches in the Hei Dahuang Residence Area, and Have No Ability to Attack Again</p>
<p>According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter with the army in Jiangwan at 9:30 p.m. on the 13th, the remnants of the enemy army who retreated to the Hei Dahuang Residence area on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Creek were hidden in trenches all day and had no ability to attack again. In order to eliminate the remnants, our army continued to encircle and attack, and our army made considerable progress.</p>
<p>The enemy forces west of the Shanghai-Tai Highway on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Creek were fiercely counterattacked by our army, killing about 5,000 enemy soldiers, and their main force was finally defeated. Our army took advantage of the victory to mop up and drove the enemy to the area along the creek in the Hei Dahuang Residence, the Baju Residence, the Yang Residence, and the Zhao Family Residence. Currently, the remnants are digging deep trenches in that area, still trying to resist stubbornly. Our army is now actively advancing to eliminate them all.</p>
<p>The Enemy Remnants are Trapped in the Gujia Residence</p>
<p>According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter with the army at 10:25 a.m. on the 13th, a part of the enemy army that crossed the Wenzaobang Creek from the Jiangjia Residence was still trying to fight desperately after being surrounded by our army on three sides. Yesterday, they broke out of the encirclement four times, but none succeeded. At dawn today, the enemy attacked again, and our army immediately launched a brave counterattack. After a fierce battle lasting about an hour, the enemy army could not support it and retreated into the trenches. In this battle, more than 70 enemy soldiers were killed, and 7 light machine guns, more than 30 rifles, and countless other spoils of war were captured. The enemy who crossed from the Dongyang Residence has been largely eliminated after days of attacks by our army. Now there are only a few remnants left, trapped in the Gujia Residence, trying to make a final struggle. This morning, we launched another close attack, and the enemy army was extremely embarrassed and has lost the ability to attack.</p>
<p>The Front Line of Miaohang Has Been Quiet for Days</p>
<p>According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter with the army in Jiangwan at 9:30 p.m. on the 13th, the front line of Miaohang has been very quiet for days. However, on the left side, along the north bank of the Wenzaobang Creek, in places such as the Miaoji and Zhou Residences, the enemy soldiers bombarded the south bank with machine guns and mortars all day long, seemingly continuing to attempt to cross the river secretly. Our troops stationed in the Sanfeng Residence, the Caijia Residence, and other places are on high alert and are retaliating, and the enemy has not succeeded in the end.</p>

<h3>The Enemy Changes its Target and Appears to be Besieging Miaohang</h3>
<p>According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter with the army in Jiangwan at 1:00 a.m. on the 14th, after suffering heavy losses on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Creek, the enemy is now gathering in the Hei Dahuang Residence area, seemingly retreating to the north bank and moving west with Chenjiaxiang as its target, causing the enemy army to make a new attempt to advance. Their target seems to be Miaohang. According to intelligence, the enemy at Zhanghuabang and Yinhang crossed the Nan Silt River and concentrated in the east and west Tangjia Residences, reaching the number of two regiments. The enemy entrenched in the Sijing Stadium used to attack our army positions in Hejiaxiang, but at 6:00 p.m. last night, they changed their target and moved to the Gaojing Temple south of Miaohang. Our army has been on high alert along the Jiangyang Road, but there has been no contact as of the report. In addition, the enemy artillery on the north bank of the Yunzaobang Creek has been constantly bombarding the Miaohang area and has not stopped all day long. A fierce battle is expected this morning.</p>
<h3>Our Army Launches Fierce Attacks in Several Directions in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Our Army Attacked the Sijing Stadium in Two Directions Yesterday, Charging and Engaging in Hand-to-Hand Combat, Killing More Than 170 Enemy Soldiers</p>
<p>According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter with the army in Jiangwan at 1:00 a.m. on the 14th, after the enemy planes disappeared yesterday evening, our troops stationed in Jiangwan, the Dujia Residence, the Guangdong Middle School, and the Chizhi University became active. At 7:00 p.m., without waiting for the enemy to attack, they launched a fierce attack in several directions on the enemy's base areas such as the 63 Garden and the Patriotic Girls' School. The enemy responded until 10:00 p.m. Another team of our army attacked the side and back of the 63 Garden along Guangli Road, and was still engaged in fierce fighting as of the report. Our army has a considerable advantage.</p>
<p>Our Army Pounces on the Sijing Stadium</p>
<p>According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter with the army in Jiangwan at 1:20 p.m. yesterday, a fierce battle took place south of the Sijing Stadium last night. Our army's attack was quite successful. At 3:00 a.m. today, they approached the enemy's base in the Sijing Stadium in two directions. The enemy was so suppressed that they launched repeated charges against us with all their strength. The two sides engaged in close combat and began to fight hand-to-hand, attacking each other with bayonets. For a time, the sound of guns and cannons temporarily ceased, and only the sound of shouting and killing shook the sky. After holding out for three hours, the enemy suffered more than 170 casualties and finally could not support it and retreated into the formation. In order to prevent our continued advance, the enemy urgently mobilized a dozen tanks from the downtown area to bombard our back and sides, and their artillery fire was extremely fierce. Therefore, our leading troops gradually retreated and still held the original position firmly. After this sweep by our army, the enemy's courage has been chilled, and our army is still adopting a preemptive strategy, striving to drive the enemy away.</p>
<p>The Enemy at Yinhang Attacks Several Times</p>
<p>According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter with the army in Jiangwan at 10:35 a.m. yesterday, the enemy in the Yinhang area launched several attacks on our positions in the Dongqu Residence to Sunjia Residence area from the night before to yesterday morning. Their intention seemed to be to relieve the siege of the remaining enemy in Dongyang Residence, but our army was on strict alert and waited for the enemy to approach before launching a machine gun sweep. The enemy finally could not support it and collapsed.</p>
<h3>The Battle at Guangfu Town is Relatively Quiet</h3>
<p>There Were No Fierce Battles in the Luodian Area Yesterday Either; The Enemy's Central Breakthrough Plan Was Thwarted</p>
<p>The fighting in the Guangfu Town area was relatively quiet yesterday. The attacking enemy, after being bravely repelled by our army, was obviously exhausted and unable to attack again, and had to wait for reinforcements and reinforcements. There were no fierce battles on the Luodian-Liuhang line yesterday either. Enemy planes were only active in the high altitude. The line seemed to be affected by the disastrous defeat of the remaining enemy in Wenzaobang and had to be reorganized and wait for reinforcements before it could be active again. According to the Central News Agency, a captured soldier of the enemy's 9th Division confessed that the commander was ordered to advance and occupy Chenjiaxiang, about three kilometers south of Guangfu Town, before September. The town is located on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Creek, between Dachang and Nanxiang, and its location is very important. The enemy tried hard to carry out the plan, but failed in the end. As of yesterday, the enemy was still staying about two and a half kilometers away from the place. Therefore, the plan to break through the central part was obviously severely hit, and the mad words of reaching a certain line on a certain day of a certain month were purely exaggerations of the enemy army, and there was no certainty in their actions.</p>
<p>According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter with the army in Guangfu at 12:45 p.m. on the 13th, a part of the enemy, about five or six hundred people, was building fortifications in the North and South Zhou Residences, about one kilometer west of the Luodian-Jiading Highway in the Luodian area, and there was no other movement. However, the enemy attacked the Sucun area at night and was immediately repelled by us. The enemy who invaded Xiaojia Residence was also defeated by us in the evening. According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter with the army in Guangfu at 12:45 p.m. on the 13th, the enemy and our positions in the Caowang Temple area were very close. The enemy hid in the trees for days to observe our army's actions. If the guards in our trenches moved slightly, the enemy would shoot with machine guns. After our army侦侦discovered the enemy's machine gun positions, they bombarded them with mortars. After the enemy was hit, they fled in a panic.</p>
<h3>The Enemy is Trying to Land at Baimaokou</h3>
<p>Yesterday They Tried to Land at Maqiaokou Again and Were Repelled</p>
<p>As of the 11th, there were 22 enemy warships anchored in the waters of Liuhe Baimaokou. On the 12th, another 11 transports arrived. Our troops stationed along the coast knew that the enemy was planning to land, so they were on high alert. At about 5:00 p.m., the enemy warships fired artillery shells at the shore, and then covered more than 30 small speedboats, fully loaded with marines, to approach the coast, trying to land. After our shooting, more than 10 ships were sunk on the spot. The enemy knew that we were prepared, and the remaining ships retreated together. Yesterday morning, they tried to land at Maqiaokou again. In addition to the enemy warships shelling the shore, there were also four enemy planes flying to help the battle. Our army fired artillery shells in response. For a time, the sound shook the distance and the artillery fire was very fierce. The fierce battle subsided at about 2:00 p.m. After our severe blow, the landing plan failed to materialize. However, several houses along the coast were bombed by enemy planes, killing and injuring more than 80 innocent residents. According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter with the army in Guangfu at 12:45 p.m. on the 13th, there were more than 20 enemy warships anchored outside Baimaokou. Last night, they bombarded the shore with artillery shells to cover dozens of their speedboats, which were sailing towards the shore, seemingly trying to test our army's strength and attempt to land. We fought fiercely with machine guns, small cannons, etc., and repelled the enemy all night. By 3:00 a.m. yesterday, most of the enemy warships had sailed downstream, but our army is still monitoring them closely.</p>
<h3>Latest News</h3>
<p>According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter with the army in Jiangwan at 1:00 a.m. on the 14th, starting at 7:30 p.m. yesterday, the enemy and we launched attacks with tanks on Xiangyin Road,展开developing a new type of mechanized warfare. The enemy's tanks came from the downtown area across the Songhu Road to the west, and our tanks came from the Sports Association Road to the east. The two sides met on Xiangyin Road and bombarded each other with small cannons on the tanks and mortars from the rear. They went back and forth, entering and exiting the Huangxing Road Qimei Road, and held each other for as long as four hours. At about 11:30, our gradual advance was close to the Yejia Garden of Fudan University, and fierce fighting was still going on. The enemy abandoned corpses along the way, totaling sixty or seventy people.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Intentionally Shoot at British Military Attaché, Britain is Extremely Angry</h3>
<p>Preparing to Protest to Japan Severely; Japanese Authorities Still Attempting to Evade Responsibility</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the bombing of three cars of the British Embassy in China by Japanese planes near Minhang, public opinion here is extremely indignant. The British government is preparing to lodge a strong protest with Tokyo. The "Daily Express" published a long article today, discussing the matter and emphasizing that the British government considers this incident to be extremely serious. The "Daily Mail" stated that if such an incident is still tolerable, then what hope is there for Europe? (Haitong Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The local newspapers expressed regret over the bombing of the British Embassy in China by the Japanese air force, believing that even if this incident can be resolved in the short term, the relationship between Britain and Japan will be greatly affected. The refusal of a major bank in London to accept Japanese drafts and the Newland government's ban on the export of scrap iron to Japan have made Dongshi feel uneasy. Political circles believe that if the relationship between Britain and Japan deteriorates, Japan's blockade of the Chinese coast will become more severe. (Haitong Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] It is reported that the enemy planes strafed the British Embassy's Deputy Air Attaché Murray and the Secretary of the Soviet Embassy, ​​Shakhovsha, in Maqiao, Minhang. It is said that Mr. He Wu of the British Embassy decided to answer the visitor with solemn words, saying that Murray and others had notified the Japanese side before their departure, and the British Ambassador is investigating the matter and telegraphed the situation to London. According to the Soviet Embassy, ​​Shakhovsha was originally from Shanghai to Nanjing on that day. Because the car was damaged on the way, he encountered a car from the British Embassy and returned to Shanghai in that car. Today, the Soviet Embassy here called Shakhovsha to inquire about the process and transferred it to Moscow for reporting. The embassy does not want to make any comments on this matter at this time. (Special Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>Western Newspapers Detail the Truth of the Incident</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily" stated that yesterday (the 12th), another unfortunate international incident occurred in the local war zone. Six Japanese planes flew near Minhang and opened fire with machine guns on three private cars from Nanjing to Shanghai. The main people in the cars were British Embassy Air Force Captain Murray, an employee of the Aviation Affairs Office, Italian Embassy Naval Captain Albizzi, and Soviet Embassy Military Attaché Secretary Shakhov. It is heard that two of the cars belonged to the British Embassy, ​​and the other car belonged to the Shanghai American Trading Ford Motor Company, carrying three British people, one Italian person, one German-Russian person named Feitinghoff, who was the driver of the American company's car (according to the "Shanghai Times", he was the manager of the Nanjing branch of the American Trading Company), and two Chinese people. Although a bullet passed through the top of the American company's car, and the glass window of Captain Murray's car was also shattered, none of the seven passengers were injured. Mr. Fei's car was the first to go. At about 4:00 p.m., just after leaving Minhang, he saw six Japanese planes flying in the sky, intending to attack. Mr. Fei stopped the car and jumped out of the car with a reporter from the Chinese newspaper and jumped into a small creek on the side of the road, and then climbed into the rice field from the creek. Later, the two cars of the British Embassy also stopped immediately. Fortunately, everyone was alert, so they avoided injury or death. After the Japanese plane opened fire with machine guns on the cars, it flew away, and everyone's clothes were wet and covered in mud. They got back into the car and drove to Shanghai in a hurry. The exact number of Japanese planes participating in the attack has not yet been determined. One said that four planes suddenly descended on the car, and two planes hovered in the high altitude. The planes that descended were flying very low, and the pilots could be seen clearly. The two cars of the British Embassy had British flags spread on the roof of the car. Although it is certain that the car of the American company was carrying Americans, it was not known last night whether it was carrying Americans. Because the Russian driver of the car, Mr. Fei, wanted to take a bath and change clothes after arriving in Shanghai and did not have time to talk in detail. As for the fact that Shakhov, an employee of the Soviet Embassy, ​​was traveling with the car, it was purely accidental. Mr. Sha drove his own car from Shanghai to Nanjing in the early morning yesterday. At 7:00 a.m., he drove to a place seven miles south of Minhang. Because the car was damaged, he walked back to Minhang, but he could not contact the local Soviet authorities until 3:00 p.m. and asked them to send a car to tow his car back to Shanghai. The cars of the British Embassy drove past Minhang, and Mr. Sha explained everything to Captain Murray, who agreed to take him back to Shanghai. After the Shanghai Soviet Consulate received Mr. Sha's call, they sent a car to Minhang, but unexpectedly, at about 4:15 p.m., just four or five miles out of the French Concession, it was also strafed by Japanese planes with machine guns. It is believed that the shooter was the same Japanese plane that shot at the British Embassy's car fifteen minutes earlier. The driver stopped the car and took shelter in the forest. It is not known what nationality the driver was.</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" also reported the incident, saying that the cars that were attacked were two cars of the British Embassy and a luggage car, all driven by British army drivers. There were four British people in the cars. In addition to Captain Murray, a well-known British aviator and Royal Air Force Attaché of the British Embassy, ​​there were Mr. London Whiteham, who used to work for the China Railway Bureau, Mr. Hinden of Jardine Matheson, and Mr. Marshall. Captain Murray's car was hit by several bullets, and the windshield was also shattered.</p>
<p>The "English Great American Evening News" stated that the local British authorities are still investigating the truth of the case in which Japanese planes strafed a British Embassy car with machine guns on Tuesday afternoon, so they have not yet issued a formal statement. According to non-official sources, the British Embassy's car followed the route specified in the note and followed all the conditions agreed in advance. There were three cars in this trip, one of which belonged to the American Trading Ford Motor Company. The top of the car was hit by a machine gun bullet, and its blue back was painted with a British flag four feet long and five feet wide, and it was not as the Japanese claimed that the car body was yellow and looked like a Chinese military car. The Japanese planes were flying very low at the time and could definitely see the markings on the tops of the cars. If Aviation Captain Murray had not quickly jumped into the ditch on the side of the road, his life would have been in danger, because the windshield of his car had been shattered. However, the Japanese military spokesman strengthened his argument when he met with foreign reporters today, saying that the three cars did not travel along the specified route. The case is currently being investigated by the British Consulate in Shanghai, because the British Embassy in Shanghai has insufficient personnel to handle it, and it is necessary to exchange telegrams with London, which will take many days if necessary. Local British officials held a meeting before 5:00 p.m. on the day they received the information. Japanese consular officials visited the British Consulate this morning, and British officials also visited Japanese officials several times regarding the case. The staff of the British Consulate consulted all morning today, and it seems unlikely that they will publish a statement in the newspaper this afternoon. The Soviet Consulate only admitted that its embassy staff member Mr. Sha was in danger in the same car, and made no further comments. People in Shanghai are now very concerned about the reaction of British newspapers to this case. The British people's boycott of Japanese goods is now actively underway and may become even more vigorous as a result.</p>
<p>Chinese Officials Send Police to Protect</p>
<p>According to a report from our reporter in Shanghai, although the three cars carrying the personnel of the British Embassy were covered with huge British flags on the top of the cars, the enemy planes brazenly ignored them and carried out the attack. However, the report that the car passed through Minhang Maqiao was actually a mistake of the Shangsong Road Maqiao Station. When the enemy plane strafed, a patrol officer from the local Public Security Bureau guided the personnel to a nearby safe place to hide. Later, when the car traveled about two miles to Beiqiao, it was attacked again. Li Zhifu, the county magistrate of Shanghai County, came out to greet them at the county government hall to express his condolences, and sent police to protect them along the way. The car arrived safely in Shanghai. According to witnesses at Maqiao Station, when the enemy plane was chasing the car, it was only three or four feet above the top of the car, and everything could be seen clearly. The machine gun strafing lasted for more than 20 minutes, so the cars were hit by bullets, and passers-by were scratched by bullets on their shoulders. Therefore, the people in the car were unscathed.</p>
<h3>British Consulate Announces Details of Japanese Aircraft Attack on Military Attaché Case</h3>
<p>Both Vehicle Roofs Attacked Painted with British National Emblem</p>
<p>Mr. Marre, Air Force Captain of the British Embassy, and his party, arrived in Shanghai on the 12th from Beijing. Near Minhang, they were attacked by Japanese aircraft. Fortunately, they were not injured. The British Consulate General yesterday specifically announced the details of the incident,</p>
<p>Identifying Japanese Aircraft</p>
<p>Mr. Marre and his party were traveling in three embassy cars, leaving Beijing at 4:00 AM. They followed the Beijing-Shanghai Highway via Yixing, Huzhou, Jiaxing, and Songjiang, to Shanghai. They had previously notified the Japanese side that they would be traveling from Beijing to Songjiang safely. After crossing the ferry there, about five miles away, they encountered a certain member of the Soviet Embassy and his wife, along with their Chinese driver. Due to a malfunction with the car's battery, they were stopped on the roadside and unable to continue. At their request, they joined Mr. Marre's car, so that they could go to Shanghai to purchase a new battery and then return to pick up his wife. About ten minutes after the car continued forward, Mr. Marre saw two large, single-winged aircraft and two smaller aircraft of the same type. They were divided into two groups, about three miles away from the car, flying towards Nanjing at an altitude of approximately 3,000 to 4,000 feet. Twenty minutes later, they saw three single-engine biplanes on the left side of the highway. He identified them as Japanese aircraft, the same as the ones seen earlier. At the time, there may have been more aircraft, but the field of vision was limited by the car's windows, preventing them from seeing them.</p>
<p>Details of the Attack</p>
<p>One or two minutes later, between approximately 3:55 PM and 4:00 PM, they suddenly saw pedestrians on the road and in the fields behaving with great alarm. A Chinese man came running towards them, shouting "Airplanes! Airplanes!" The two cars immediately stopped. Mr. Marre, without a hat, got out of the car and stood in the middle of the road to show the Japanese pilots that he was a foreigner. However, his companions had already run into the fields for cover. At this time, several aircraft flew towards the highway in a straight line at an altitude of 1,000 feet, forming a right angle with the car. As the leading aircraft flew over the highway, it immediately banked to the right at a 45-degree angle, swooping towards the car. It did not open fire until it was at an altitude of 600-700 feet. The second aircraft also flew towards the car in the same way, but as it descended, machine gun fire was seen erupting from the nose of the plane. Mr. Marre urgently called for the driver remaining in the car to leave the car and take temporary shelter in the air raid shelter about four yards away on the side of the road. As he reached the shelter, he heard the sound of bullets hitting the ground and exploding.</p>
<p>Bullets Hit Car Windows</p>
<p>The aircraft stopped firing when it descended to 300 feet. Mr. Marre then ran to a tree 40 yards away for cover. Mr. Marre saw three more aircraft under the tree, also swooping down and opening fire, while the other three remained at a high altitude for about five to ten minutes. The planes then regrouped and flew towards Shanghai, the larger ones in front and the smaller ones behind. After the planes left, Mr. Marre returned to the car and saw a bullet hole in the car window. There were even more bullet marks nearby. It was also mentioned that both vehicles that were attacked had the British national emblem painted on their roofs. The other car in front only had a flag displayed, which was not spread out on the roof.</p>

<h3>Retrospective of Two Months of Battle in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Enemy's Dream of Occupying Shanghai Shattered Completely, Our Confidence in Victory Strengthened</p>
<p>[Nanjing] It has been exactly two months since the start of the Battle of Shanghai. Our soldiers at the front lines have used their flesh and blood to build a great wall to resist the enemy's fierce artillery fire, ultimately shattering the dream of the enemy commanders to quickly occupy Shanghai. At the same time, our compatriots across the country have become increasingly confident in victory. Looking back at the process of the Battle of Shanghai over these two months, it can be roughly divided into two periods. The first period, from the outbreak of the war to September 13, saw our forces shift to Liuhuo, Luodian, Liuhang, Baziqiao, Miaohang, Jiangwan Town, and the North Railway Station. The main significance of this period was to consume a large amount of enemy strength while preventing them from landing. The period from September 13 to today can be called the second period. However, in the first two weeks of this period, from September 13 to September 29, both sides suddenly changed positions, and were waiting to consolidate their defenses and reorganize their troops. Therefore, there were no fierce major battles. But in the last two weeks, from September 29 to October 13, our eastern battlefield saw an unprecedentedly tense period. Since the enemy began its fourth general offensive on the night of September 28, they bombarded our positions in Luodian with heavy artillery while using aircraft and artillery to bombard Zhabei and Jiangwan. The main force attacked the Shanghai-Tai Highway between Luodian and Liuhang, attempting to break through the line and occupy our strongholds west of Luodian, in order to carry out a sweeping invasion. Our forces had been deployed on this line for more than half a month and had been fully prepared for the enemy's plot. From 5:00 AM on September 29 to 9:00 AM the next morning, the 28-hour battle resulted in a fatal blow to the enemy's fourth general offensive plan. Afterwards, although the enemy continued to attack our left and right wings in Zhabei and Luodian with aircraft and heavy artillery, and enemy ships in the Huangpu River bombarded our Pudong positions almost daily, the enemy's primary objective was undoubtedly a failure. However, the area between Luodian and Liuhang was almost completely scorched earth after being heavily bombarded by the enemy. Therefore, on the 2nd of this month, our forces in the area made an orderly move along the Shanghai-Tai Highway to the strongholds 800 to 1,000 meters west of the highway. At this time, the enemy also automatically retreated about one kilometer in the Jiangwan city center area. After both sides changed positions in this way, the enemy launched a full-scale attack on us again after more than 30 hours, still focusing on the Luodian-Liuhang-Gu Family House line. But unlike the fourth general offensive, which concentrated forces on the north bank of the Yunzaobang River between Luodian and Liuhang, this time they were trying to cross the Yunzaobang by force. Therefore, the center of the battle was in Tangqiao, Yaojia Alley, Yanjia House, Gu Family House, and other places. From noon on the 4th of this month, the enemy used heavy artillery to bombard our positions south of the river, firing hundreds of rounds per hour to cover large groups of infantry forcing a crossing at the above points. Our forces defended firmly on the south bank. The enemy and we faced each other across the river, and the fierce battle lasted all day. Both sides suffered extremely heavy losses. The enemy suffered no less than 10,000 casualties, and only about two regiments crossed to the south bank of the Yunzaobang to fight our forces. They still failed to break through our line of defense. After the 4th and 5th, the enemy knew that our positions were difficult to attack. Except for occasionally probing our defenses in the Liuhang area with tanks and armored vehicles, they only continued to force crossings of the Yunzaobang River at night on the southwest front of Luodian. By the 8th and 9th of this month, the center of gravity of the entire line had shifted from the north bank of the Yunzaobang to the south bank. By 4:00 PM on the 11th, the enemy had gathered a division near Yanjiawan and Heidahuang House on the south bank and launched a fierce battle against our positions near Shiqiaozhai. The enemy once broke through the Shiqiaozhai line and charged into our wing positions for about two kilometers. Our forces fought back bravely, and the fierce battle lasted until 7:00 PM, with many casualties. After reinforcements arrived, they launched a fierce siege on the enemy and finally recovered the original positions. On the nights of the 12th and 13th, the enemy still tried to attack on this line, but was repeatedly repelled by our forces. The fighting was particularly fierce on the night of the 12th. The enemy was fighting a trapped beast on the south bank of the Yunzaobang while reinforcing from three directions, attempting a central breakthrough, directly attacking Dachang, and trying to break into Nanxiang, in order to realize its plan to force us to retreat to the second line of defense before October 15. But our frontline soldiers, unafraid of sacrifice, had already defeated the main force of the enemy army south of the river. As of the night of the 12th, only a few remnants remained to be cleared. The enemy's plot for a third general offensive after September 28 had also failed in the same way. Of course, we cannot ignore the battle situation in Zhabei and Jiangwan, but these two places are similar to Pudong. Although they are often the targets of intensive enemy artillery fire, the positions have not changed in the slightest. Overall, in the second phase of the Shanghai battle, the enemy launched three general offensives, and their main goal was to achieve a central breakthrough. However, they have all failed under the resistance of our loyal and brave soldiers. The casualties before and after, even according to the enemy's own admission, were over 30,000. During this period, the intensity of the enemy's artillery attacks and the cruelty of the aerial bombings were deemed by European and American observers to be far beyond the First World War, the Italian-Ethiopian War, and the Spanish Civil War. Therefore, our soldiers have repeatedly defeated the enemy's general offensives and defended their original positions, not only leaving a great feat of resisting aggression in world military history, but also adding a great brilliance to our nation's sacred liberation war. It is believed that under the leadership of the leader, our compatriots on the front and rear will continue to maintain this heroic spirit, and the final victory will surely belong to us.

<h3>Li Zongren Arrives in Nanjing to Discuss His Appointment to Supervise Troops to Resist the Enemy</h3>
<p>Under the Leadership of the Central Government and Chairman Chiang, the Whole Country Will Exert All Its Efforts to Resist to the End</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Li Zongren, accompanied by Huang Jilu, arrived in Nanjing from Hankou on a special steamer at 4:00 PM on the 13th. He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, and the Vice Ministers of Finance Zou Lin and Xu Kan were all at the dock to welcome him. After exchanging greetings with He and the others, Li took a car into the city to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang, which lasted for a long time before he left. It is reported that Li came to report the enthusiasm of the people and soldiers of Guangxi Province in supporting the supreme leader and preparing to resist to the end. He will be staying in Nanjing for a considerable period. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After Li Zongren arrived in Nanjing on the 13th, reporters visited him. The following is a record of the questions and answers: (Reporter asked) When did the Commander-in-Chief leave Guangxi? (Li replied) I flew from Guangxi to Hunan on the 10th, transferred to Wuhan that day, and took a steamer to Beijing. However, I was slightly delayed by the wind and waves along the way, so I only arrived today. (Asked) What is the mission of the Commander-in-Chief's visit to Beijing this time? (Answer) I came to Beijing this time because I recently received an order from the Central Government to supervise the troops to resist the enemy, so I came to Beijing to meet Chairman Chiang and ask for instructions on everything. (Asked) What are the Commander-in-Chief's views on this war of resistance against the enemy? (Answer) I believe that Japanese aggression has always held the determination to destroy our country. Therefore, if we want to save the country and the nation from danger, we must launch a strong resistance with the unanimous effort of the whole country. In the past, we strongly advocated the scorched earth policy of resistance, which was for this reason. Now, fortunately, this great and sacred national defense and war of resistance has been successfully launched under the decision of the Central Government and the leadership of Chairman Chiang. Our comrades and compatriots across the country can only exert all their efforts to support the government's policy of resistance to the end. It must be known that our war of resistance against Japan is not only fought for the survival and liberation of the country and the nation, but also for maintaining the peace and justice of the world and mankind. It has not only won the enthusiastic support of the national people in the country, but also all those who advocate justice and peace in the world have given us sympathy and assistance. Therefore, the final victory must belong to us. (Asked) After the Commander-in-Chief left Guangxi, what is the situation of the rear work in Guangxi Province? (Answer) All rear work in Guangxi is being carried out according to the original construction plan. Because the ultimate goal of Guangxi's construction is to revitalize China, and its current central task is to organize the people and train the people in order to achieve the thorough liberation of the nation. At this last juncture of the country and the nation's survival, all the past construction achievements of Guangxi should be provided to the central government for centralized use. Future work should focus on the continuous supply of manpower and material resources in the war of resistance against the enemy. In addition, the anti-enemy sentiment of the people of Guangxi is extremely high, and it is very easy to smoothly promote various rear preparation work during the war of resistance. As for my anti-enemy duties and actions, they must be determined after asking the Chairman for instructions. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>German Newspaper Explains Reasons for Not Participating</h3>
<p>[Berlin] The "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" published a long article today commenting on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, stating that Germany has no relationship with the treaty. At the same time, Germany has withdrawn from the League of Nations. The newspaper put forward the reason why Germany did not participate in the Nine-Power Treaty was at the request of the Chinese government. At that time, the Chinese government insisted that if Germany participated, it would be very detrimental to Sino-German friendship. The newspaper went on to say that when the Washington Conference was held in 1921-1922, the United States supported Germany's accession, while France strongly opposed it. After the Nine-Power Treaty was ratified, the U.S. government invited Germany to participate again in 1925. The German government replied that it would participate if the German Parliament approved it. Subsequently, the Chinese government and the Kuomintang protested, arguing that if Germany participated in the Washington Treaty, it would conflict with the existing treaties between China and Germany. In February 1926, the Chinese Minister to Germany and the Berlin branch of the Kuomintang successively protested and appealed to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Parliament. Therefore, Germany agreed not to participate in the Washington Treaty. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)</p>

<h3>German Government Announces Non-Aggression Against Belgian Independence</h3>
<p>Both Parties Exchange Documents, an Important Contribution to Peace in Western Europe</p>
<p>[Berlin] The German document formally recognizing the inviolability of Belgian territory and its independence was presented today. It was exchanged between German Foreign Minister Neurath and Belgian Ambassador to Germany Davignon at the Foreign Ministry. The German document declares that the inviolability and integrity of Belgian territory is a matter of common concern for Western European powers. The German government does not wish, under any circumstances, to attack the inviolability and integrity of Belgian territory. However, if Belgium cooperates with other countries in a way that is detrimental to German military operations, Germany will not always respect Belgium's territorial rights. If Belgium is attacked or invaded by another country, the German government is prepared to assist Belgium, along with the US and French governments. The Belgian government's document only expresses its deep gratitude for the German government's declaration. (Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Belgian Communique</h3>
<p>Does Not Ignore Treaty Obligations</p>

<h3>German Government Issues Public Statement</h3>
<p>Elaborating on the Declaration</p>
<p>[Berlin] Foreign Minister Neurath sent a letter to the Belgian government today, explaining that the German government recognizes Belgium's inviolability and integrity. After the letter was published, the government immediately issued a public statement elaborating on its contents, stating: "The purpose of Germany's declaration is to explain Germany's view of Belgium's international status before a future Western European pact is signed. The Locarno Treaty had previously stipulated Belgium's international status, but since Germany lifted the restrictions on the demilitarization of the Rhineland, negotiations have been ongoing between the relevant countries to conclude a new Locarno Treaty. During this time, Belgium requested the removal of the obligations it bears under the Locarno Treaty, and for the countries concerned to guarantee its territorial integrity. After the exchange of notes between Belgium and Britain and France on April 24 of this year, Britain and France recognized that Belgium could remove the obligations it bears under the Locarno Treaty. The German government has always been in complete sympathy with Belgium's desire for independence, as stated by Chancellor Hitler in his speech to the Reichstag on January 30 of this year, in which he declared that Germany was prepared to recognize and guarantee Belgium's inviolability. It is currently impossible to predict when the negotiations for a new Locarno Treaty will be completed. Therefore, the German government believes that it is appropriate to explain Germany's attitude towards Belgium at this time, hence the publication of the declaration. In the declaration, the German government undertakes to refrain from damaging Belgium's inviolability and integrity in any situation and will always respect Belgium's territory. However, exceptions will be made if Belgian troops participate in combat against Germany or if Belgium implements the League of Nations Covenant and allows troops hostile to Germany to pass through its territory. In addition, if Belgium becomes the target of aggression and attack and wishes to obtain German assistance, Germany is also prepared to provide assistance. The German government has taken this fair and impartial action, expecting that it will contribute to the preservation of peace in Europe and deeply believing that this action will also have a beneficial impact on the development of good neighborly relations between Germany and Belgium."

<h3>Unstable Situation in Manchukuo</h3>
<p>Northern People Are Not Under Control; Kwantung Army Dispatches Over 100,000 Troops</p>
<p>[Beiping] According to reliable foreign sources in Beiping, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, "Manchukuo" has shown signs of instability. The Kwantung Army has dispatched over 100,000 additional troops to northern Manchukuo in the past two months, as the majority of the people in that area are dissatisfied with the current situation. It is reported that there are more armed civilians resisting the authorities than there are troops, and deserters are also continuously joining them. It is rumored that many places are completely out of the authorities' control. The lives and property of Japanese people are now in danger. Although the organization of the popular movement is not sufficient and there is a lack of leadership, it is not enough to hinder Japan's military operations in North China. However, it is generally speculated that the situation in "Manchukuo" will be even more serious this winter. (Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>This Account Must Be Settled from the Beginning</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty, openly invading our country's territory for more than six years. However, countries like Britain and the United States are only now becoming concerned and calling for a meeting to settle this account. Needless to say, this will not be easy.</p>
<p>Our only requirement is that this account be settled from the beginning. Our country must restore its complete territory before September 18th. All the de facto situations created by Japan using military force within our country since September 18th must also be completely overturned.</p>
<p>As for Japan, the entire country is now under the control of the military. Before our two million troops fundamentally extinguish the violent arrogance of the Japanese soldiers, it will certainly be very difficult to rely solely on diplomatic pressure to make Japan accept any degree of settlement.</p>
<p>However, the relevant powers in the Far East, especially Britain and the United States, may take effective measures to settle this account. The so-called effective measures are, first, economic sanctions, and second, military sanctions. The effectiveness of military sanctions goes without saying. The effectiveness of economic sanctions is also very strong because Japan's war machine is ultimately dependent on Britain and the United States (for military raw materials, etc.).</p>
<p>I believe that the political leaders of Britain and the United States have already resolutely declared their determination to uphold the dignity of the treaty. They must have made some preparations for these effective measures. What they are considering now is how to find a way to implement them amidst complex and contradictory international relations.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Massacre Over Two Thousand Civilians in Shuoxian</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Burned to Death After Being Force-Fed Kerosene; Women in Daiyue Paraded Naked Through the Streets</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] According to people from Shuoxian, when enemy troops occupied Shuoxian city, they harbored resentment against the people and killed over two thousand people. The county magistrate and county government personnel were all burned alive after being force-fed kerosene. Dozens of people in Daiyue Mayi towns were also killed or injured by the enemy. They even undressed women and paraded them naked through the streets for amusement. Wherever the Japanese invaders went, they forced the people to hang enemy flags and post slogans of welcome, and would burn, kill, or bury alive those who disobeyed. This gentleman witnessed these tragic scenes and his pain and anger were evident in his face when he spoke with reporters. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Korean Revolutionary Party Issues Declaration Calling for Unity Between China and Korea to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>Overthrow the Rule of Japanese Imperialism; Lay the Foundation for Peace in East Asia</p>
<p>The Korean National Revolutionary Party's Shanghai Special District issued an urgent declaration to fellow Chinese and Korean compatriots yesterday in order to resist the Japanese invasion of China. The essence of it is excerpted below: The current surge of the Chinese anti-Japanese movement has already spread to the internal parts of all weak and small nations in the East, awakening the self-consciousness of the oppressed nations of the East and strengthening their determination and confidence in the struggle for liberation. We, the Korean nation, who are in the same predicament, have endured the whips and enslavement of Japanese imperialism for nearly thirty years. Our twenty-three million compatriots have placed the greatest hopes and expectations on China's resolute war of resistance against Japan in order to complete their own tasks at this stage. At present, although the Korean nation has suffered all kinds of division and devastation, the development of anti-Japanese forces is more robust than before, and the outbreak of an all-out anti-Japanese struggle is highly likely. We revolutionaries have always been loyal to the nation and committed to the cause of liberation. Every member can express their sincere loyalty, show courage, and constantly encourage themselves to never forget the struggle. On the surface, due to the control of public opinion by the Japanese fascist bandits, it seems to be static and stagnant, but in reality, the formation of the largest anti-Japanese force has already taken place. We believe that the geographical environment of the Korean nation is between the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union, which is closely related to the well-being of the two major nations. All the losses suffered by the Korean nation easily affect the security of the national defense of the two major nations. For thirty years, Japanese imperialism has often shown off its powerful control over Korea, so he can unscrupulously awaken the two neighboring countries. In a word, the more it intensifies the rule and oppression of our Korean nation, the more it intensifies the march towards China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, we must show our own anti-Japanese conscience and sincerity, express our firm attitude, and raise the bright flag of history, so as to carry out a broader and more unrestrained struggle. We firmly believe that all classes, parties, forces, and anti-Japanese individuals of the entire Korean nation will rise up courageously, come back upon hearing the news, and closely cooperate with the Chinese and Soviet nations, overthrow the thirty-year rule of the Japanese imperialist bandits in one fell swoop, and lay the foundation for peace in East Asia. Now we must work together to realize the following guidelines: ㊀ The weak and small nations of the East unite to implement a unified general mobilization to resist Japan; ㊁ All peaceful forces and democratic countries unite to resist fascist aggression and threats; ㊂ Immediately realize the large-scale anti-Japanese military cooperation between the Chinese and Korean nations in a more concrete way; ㊃ Establish a unified action guideline for the Eastern nations to resist Japan; ㊄ Support the Chinese anti-war authorities to launch an all-out war of resistance; ㊅ Support the unified front of the Korean nation; ㊆ Support all anti-Japanese organizations of fellow Chinese and Korean compatriots; ㊇ The Chinese and Korean nations should have a new spirit of cooperation in the process of resisting the war; ㊈ Overthrow Japanese imperialism and eradicate all its existing forces ㊉ Eliminate all pro-Japanese puppet organizations and traitorous elements; ㊉㊀ Long live the success of the Korean national revolution; ㊉㊁ Long live the success of the Chinese national liberation movement; ㊉㊂ Long live the success of the liberation of the weak and small nations of the East,</p>
<h3>Japanese Public Sentiment Is Restless</h3>
<p>All Goods Are Taxed, Merchants Are Very Worried; Fear of Soviet Planes, Frequent Air Defense Drills - False Reports of Victory Upset People</p>
<p>Mr. Walker, the owner of the Continental Steamship Company's "Niels Moller," recently returned to Shanghai from Shimonoseki, Japan, aboard the Nagasaki Maru. He said that although many people along the way in Japan were waving flags, the business community was panicking about the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War. Recently, Japan has been experiencing a tiger epidemic scare, with many cases occurring in Kobe and Yokohama. Many epidemic prevention measures have now been implemented. The Japanese public is quite tense about the war in Shanghai. Every day, more than a dozen transport ships pass through Moji, heading to Shanghai, but there are now two completely different public sentiments in the country: one is among the army and navy personnel and coolies, and the other is among the merchants. The state's expenditures for the war now reach one million pounds per day. The business community knows that the money must come from donations and taxes, so they are all worried. Now everything is taxed, and Japan prohibits the import of many goods. The newspapers are full of reports of the Japanese army's victories, which only upset people. Last Wednesday night, the Tokyo radio station broadcast that it had destroyed 305 Chinese planes and sunk 18 Chinese warships. Such news is only for ordinary people to swallow whole. Mr. Walker believes that what Japan fears is the Soviet Union. People in Moji often conduct air defense drills. During the day, sirens blare, and at night, lights are turned off, and even the lights in front of cars must be covered to avoid being seen from the sky. Foreigners traveling in Japan are suspected of being spies. Now, it is impossible to travel between Shimonoseki and Moji without a permit. In other words, it is difficult to travel an inch without carrying a pass issued by the police station. Chinese sailors on the ship were not interfered with, but they were all prohibited from landing. When Mr. Walker's ship went to Japan from Shanghai, the Ningbo and Shanghai gangs of sailors, fearing that the Japanese would use epidemic prevention as a pretext to force them to get poison shots, all resigned and were replaced by Tianjin gang sailors. When Mr. Walker was stationed in Moji, he estimated that 18,000 to 20,000 soldiers were transported out of the Inland Sea every day. Every two or three days, a hospital ship carrying wounded soldiers would return to that port from Shanghai.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Bonds Are Widely Promoted</h3>
<p>Postmen Sell 100,000 Yuan Worth; Two Special Districts Raise 70,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Postmen Actively Promote Sales</p>
<p>The National Salvation Bond Fundraising Committee General Headquarters, in order to popularize fundraising, specially allocated 100,000 yuan worth of small-denomination bonds of five and ten yuan before Double Ten Day, which was handed over to the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau for distribution to the postmen of the bureau to solicit donations from the citizens. Since the beginning, all the bonds have been sold out in just three days, which is enough to prove the efforts of the postmen of the bureau to solicit donations, and it can especially show the patriotic spirit of our people who are enthusiastically donating. It is heard that the postmen of the bureau are even more willing to redouble their efforts and continue their efforts. Yesterday, they specially asked the fundraising general headquarters to issue another 100,000 yuan worth of small-denomination bonds to continue soliciting donations from the citizens, so as to fulfill the duties of a citizen.</p>
<p>Fundraising Numbers in Two Special Districts</p>
<p>The Second Special District Group of the National Salvation Bond Citizen Fundraising Corps announced the fundraising results of each team before Double Ten Day yesterday. It is calculated that District Deputy Director Lu Bohong has raised 50,000 yuan, First Squad Leader Shao Baoxing 2,000 yuan, Seventh Squad Leader Mao Jiaju 2,619 yuan, Ninth Squad Leader Qu Zhenhua 1,500 yuan, Tenth Squad Leader Dong Kechang 5,275 yuan, Twelfth Squad Leader Shao Xubai 7,060 yuan, Fourteenth Squad Leader Zhu Shengmao 328 yuan, Fifteenth Squad Leader Huang Dinghui 140 yuan, and 75 yuan in national salvation savings, Seventeenth Squad Leader Qian Jiagui 288 yuan, totaling 69,215 yuan, and 75 yuan in national salvation savings. The group is now actively continuing to solicit donations and promote national salvation savings.</p>
<h3>Transit Tax Revenue Is Thriving</h3>
<p>After the launch of the national war of resistance, the government specially raised the transit tax in order to meet the various emergency preparations, military and political expenses, which have all increased sharply. Since its implementation, the industrial and commercial sectors have been actively paying, and the results have been very good. The reporter has learned from the customs that this transit tax, in Shanghai, can collect an average of about 10,000 yuan per day, which has exceeded the budget. The future is very optimistic. As for foreign trade, after the coast was blockaded by enemy warships, only foreign ships can still enter and exit, and Chinese ships have all stopped sailing. Traffic is quite inconvenient, so import and export duties have both decreased.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Economic Severance Conference Regarding Methods for Purchasing and Storing Japanese Loans</h3>
<p>All Purchases Before August 13th Must Be Registered</p>
<p>The National Economic Severance Committee Against Japan in this city held its first executive committee meeting yesterday at 10:00 AM. Over twenty people were present, including Wang Xiaolai, and the following resolutions were passed: ㊀ Amended and approved the organizational rules of the executive committee; ㊁ Petitioned the central government to prohibit citizens from trading with the enemy and to formulate a law punishing those who aid the enemy economically; ㊂ Stipulated methods for handling existing Japanese goods in the market: A. Japanese goods purchased and stored before August 13th of this year must be registered with the committee before the end of October. After registration, the committee will supervise the respective trade associations in centralizing storage and collective public sale, with 50% of the proceeds used to purchase national salvation bonds. B. Japanese goods purchased and stored after August 13th will be confiscated upon investigation. C. If Japanese goods are stored without registering with the committee, or if they are registered but sold independently without permission, once discovered, the goods will be confiscated, and the responsible parties will be severely punished according to the law; ㊃ Notified the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform its members that all previously signed contracts with Japanese businesses must be canceled and reported to the committee for record; ㊄ Trade in raw materials will be handled in the same manner as general goods; ㊅ Notified various organizations to inform their members not to work for enemy commercial or industrial institutions or families, not to use enemy warehouses, not to travel on enemy ships, not to use enemy currency, and not to have any dealings with enemy banks; ㊆ Instructed the standing committee to draft a national economic severance pact against Japan and to promote a people's oath; ㊇ Sent a letter to the Chinese chairman of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, clearly announcing the dissolution of the association; ㊈ Sent letters to trust companies, money exchanges, and banks to cease foreign exchange transactions, securities trading, and other financial relationships with Japan; ㊉ Appointed Chu Fucheng, Xu Jiying, Zhu Xuefan, Peng Wenyin, and Tao Baichuan as standing committee members; Finally, all executive committee members swore an oath of loyalty to the departed Prime Minister, with the following words: "I solemnly swear that I will strive to fulfill my duties with a fair attitude and a fearless spirit, remain loyal to the country, and never condone traitors or engage in corruption. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the severest punishment from this committee. I swear."</p>
<h3>Exchanging Gold for Currency: Beneficial for Both Oneself and the Nation</h3>
<p>Turning Useless Buried Gold into Assistance for Economic Mobilization</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance yesterday telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, urging merchants to exchange gold for legal currency. The telegram stated: "To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, greetings. The regulations for exchanging gold for legal currency have been announced and implemented by the ministry and telegraphed to various provincial and municipal governments with instructions to inform and widely publicize the matter. The effective implementation of these regulations relies on local officials, organizations, and local gentry to widely promote and diligently urge the public, so that the general merchants and public are aware that exchanging gold for currency is not only an act of loyalty to the nation but also beneficial to themselves. Only in this way can we broadly collect exchanges and achieve substantial results. This war of resistance concerns the survival of the nation. All our citizens should contribute all their strength to the country so that we can wage a long-term war of resistance and achieve final victory, elevating the nation to strength. Furthermore, the gold and silver and ornamental items collected by the people, if kept permanently, will lose interest; if used for decoration, it is extravagant and frivolous, which are undesirable in these extraordinary times. Now, by exchanging them for currency, the nation can use it to kill the enemy, and individuals can easily obtain legal currency, which can be invested in productive enterprises or deposited in banks, both of which generate interest, greatly benefiting the nation's economy. According to Article 5 of the Gold Exchange Regulations, gold can be handed over to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, or the Farmers Bank for conversion into legal currency and used as a deposit. For deposits of one year or more, in addition to a handling fee, an extra biweekly interest of two percent will be added to the regular interest rate. Assuming the regular deposit biweekly interest is seven percent, this type of deposit will be increased to nine percent, compounded annually. If deposited for nine years, the amount will double; if deposited for eighteen years, the amount will quadruple, and there is no need to worry about water, fire, thieves, or the labor of safekeeping, so one can sit back and reap great benefits. Therefore, for individuals, the thickness of the profit is unsurpassed. It is hoped that local officials will earnestly persuade and ensure that every household understands and is happy to comply, so that the useless buried gold can be used to assist the country's great plan of economic mobilization. In addition to separate telegrams, this telegram is sent to you for compliance and to inform all members and all trades to comply and implement together to achieve great efficiency. Ministry of Finance, steamed Qian Yin."</p>
<h3>Coming and Going Amidst Bombing</h3>
<p>— Guo Moruo</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>Returning to the Capital Hotel, I parted ways with Chunru and went to visit Ye Jianying at the rear office of the ×× Army. Ye was an old friend from the Northern Expedition era, and we had been through thick and thin together for a full decade. The last time we met, I remember it was one night in early August of the sixteenth year of the Republic, on a boat on Jiujiang's lake. The lake was probably Gan Tang Lake, because it was a moonless night. Everything around us was hazy. I only remember that there were water chestnuts floating everywhere in the lake, and I even picked up and ate a few fresh ones myself. I remember that Yang Hansheng and Li Demu were on the boat, and it seems like Mei Gongbin was too, but the conversation that night, just like the night scene, is completely hazy now.</p>
<p>I met Jianying in a small reception room with very simple furnishings. His appearance was not much different from ten years ago, except that his eyes were brighter, but for some reason, I always felt a sense of loneliness in his expression. This was probably because he was a skilled and brave general, and his backdrop should have been tens of thousands of soldiers, not a few sofas, right?</p>
<p>I asked about the news of friends in northern Shaanxi and also asked for the addresses of friends living in the capital. Then I went off to begin my individual visits.</p>
<p>I first went to visit Mr. Chen Lifu and Mr. Shao Lizi. Mr. Lifu was not there, and Mr. Lizi was not there either. Knowing that they were very busy, I left a note for each of them, telling them where I was staying and requesting them to specify a time and place so that I could visit them again for instruction.</p>
<p>Next, I visited Mr. Li Yingchao. This time I met him. From Yingchao's message, I learned that Chen Zhenru also lived in the capital ××. Therefore, after saying goodbye to Yingchao, I hurried back to the hotel.</p>
<p>However, Zhenru had gone out.</p>
<p>I hesitated, wanting to visit Tian Han, whom I hadn't seen in many years. But I didn't know where he lived. I knew that I could find out by calling the Xinmin News Agency to inquire, but there were many acquaintances of mine in that newspaper office, and if they found out I had arrived in Nanjing, they would immediately publish it in the newspaper, which made me a little uneasy. Whenever I saw my name in the newspaper, I felt a bit of hatred, for some reason. This was probably the emotion developed from ten years of retreat in Japan. The Japanese journalists really achieved the status of "uncrowned kings." Their pens could fully kill or save people. Even the Japanese were afraid of them, feeling that they were more terrifying than "criminals" (detectives).</p>
<p>I also thought of Fu Baoshi. He was a talented seal engraver who could engrave fine characters and fit ten thousand words within an inch. His paintings were also quite outstanding. I met him in Japan. For a period of time, he worked as a clerk at the student supervision office, earning a monthly salary of sixty yuan while working and studying diligently, and also sending money back home to support his family. I also admired his spirit of perseverance. I knew that he taught at the art department of Zhongshan University, so I asked someone to call CU to inquire, but they didn't get a result.</p>
<p>What to do? Just as I was hesitating, the phone rang. It was Zhenru calling. He had also received a message from Yingchao, knowing where I was staying. He asked me to go somewhere to have dinner with him.</p>
<p>—Yes, that was a big problem, dinner! My stomach, which had been fasting all day, told me so.</p>
<p>Zhenru was healthier than he was during the Northern Expedition.</p>
<h3>Anti-Enemy Association Suggests Dissolving the Sino-Japanese Trade Association</h3>
<p>Those Who Participated Should Express Their Position</p>
<p>The Design Committee of the Anti-Enemy Support Association of All Circles in this city, in view of the importance of the economic severance from Japan, specially suggested: ㊀ Please ask the Sino-Japanese Trade Association to automatically announce its dissolution, ㊁ Those who participated should have a public and clear expression. It is reported that the matter has been submitted to the Anti-Enemy Support Association for review and handling.</p>
<h3>Japanese Employees of Customs Request Leave and Resign</h3>
<p>The Japanese employees employed in our country's customs have requested leave and resigned one after another since the August 13th War of Resistance and no longer go to the customs to work. For example, Kishimoto, who once served as acting director-general of customs, is now staying at home and dares not go out. All official documents are sent to his residence for signature. If the government formally declares a severance of relations with Japan, these Japanese guest officials will all be suspended.</p>
<h3>Commendable Patriotic Zeal of Medicine Store Employees</h3>
<p>Using Savings to Purchase Public Bonds and Participating in the Rescue Team</p>
<p>Ma Qi Wang, a store employee of the New Star Western Medicine Store on Park Road, is currently ten years old, has pure thoughts, and has been working in the store for nearly four years. He works diligently and always adheres to integrity. He currently earns a monthly salary of ten yuan and has never wasted a single penny. Since the Japanese pirates invaded us, he has been extremely angry. He has used all seventy-five yuan of national currency, which he had saved over the years at the Shanghai Bank, to purchase national salvation bonds. He himself is now penniless. He will also join the rescue team to take on rescue work at the front. His passionate patriotism is truly admirable.</p>

<h3>Cruel and Inhumane, Enemy Planes Bomb and Wreak Havoc Again</h3>
<p>Bombs Dropped in Zhabei, Pudong, and Nanshi; Jiaxing, Hangzhou, and Other Places Also Attacked</p>
<p>Yesterday, the weather was clear. From 5:00 AM to about 9:00 AM, more than 50 enemy planes took off successively from the enemy's temporary airfield at the end of Yangshupu Road. After circling over the outskirts of this city several times, they divided into three teams and flew to Zhabei, Beixinjing, Pudong, Nanshi, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road area to wreak havoc in turn. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhabei and Other Places</p>
<p>At around 6:00 AM yesterday, nine enemy planes flew successively over Zhabei at low altitude for reconnaissance. In addition to constantly using machine guns to strafe at low altitude, they also dropped bombs on the North Railway Station, Baoshan Road, Tanziwan, and the Shanghai-Taicang Highway and Pengpu Bus Station area, one after another. At around 9:00 AM, the batch of enemy planes flew away one after another. Another nine enemy planes, divided into three teams, continued to fly to the area, circled for reconnaissance, and continued bombing until noon before leaving. From 1:00 PM, enemy planes in groups of three or six appeared over Zhabei from time to time and continued to wreak havoc until evening before leaving. In total, enemy planes dropped no less than a hundred bombs in Zhabei yesterday, but only more than thirty detonated. In addition to destroying many of our civilian houses, there was no other damage.</p>
<p>Pudong Area</p>
<p>In Pudong, at around 8:00 AM yesterday, six enemy planes dropped more than ten bombs successively in the areas of Lannidu, Yangjiadu, and Tangqiao, destroying dozens of our civilian houses and killing or injuring more than ten civilians. At around 4:00 PM, three heavy bombers circled over Pudong for reconnaissance and dropped seven bombs near Jinjiaqiao, southeast of Yangjing Town. One bomb landed on a civilian house, killing an old woman and injuring a child. The rest landed in the harbor and five landed in the fields, none of which detonated. Then, the planes flew to the Lannidu area and dropped several bombs. At the same time, enemy ships on the Huangpu River also fired cannons to bombard Pudong. Our defending troops ignored them. The enemy planes then flew away sullenly.</p>
<p>Nanshi Area</p>
<p>In Nanshi and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road area, more than ten enemy planes also appeared over Nanshi at around 7:00 AM yesterday and circled for reconnaissance. Then, some of them, about six planes, flew south to Jiaxing and dropped many bombs near Jiaxing. The extent of the losses is unclear. At around 10:00 AM, the batch of enemy planes continued to fly south and dropped many bombs at the Hangzhou Railway Station. According to news from the road, the station building and toilets of our Hangzhou station were all destroyed, killing one station worker and injuring one employee and one traveler each.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Losses Extremely Severe in the Two Months of the Songhu War of Resistance</h3>
<p>According to a Certain Military Expert, the Enemy's Spirit is Flagging; the War of Resistance Will Surely Achieve Final Victory</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reported that the brutal Japanese invasion of Songhu has lasted for two months. Thanks to the loyal and brave resistance of our soldiers, they have not been able to return. According to a certain military expert who spoke to reporters, since August 13th, the enemy has deployed its entire force to attack our Songhu. Initially, they fought along the Yangtze River, and the enemy, taking advantage of the cover of its warships, had a slight advantage. Later, our army, out of strategic needs, actively withdrew to the Shanghai-Taicang Highway line in order to severely strike the invading enemy. Therefore, in the battle of Zhadian and Liuhang, the enemy advanced and retreated no less than ten times, and the casualties were extremely severe. Recently, the enemy again divided its forces, one advancing west to attack Guangfu in an attempt to approach Jiading, and the other secretly crossing the Wenzaobang in an attempt to attack Dachang and cut off the rear of our Zhabei garrison. Our army was aware of their schemes and had already made preparations to counterattack them separately. Therefore, although the enemy deployed mechanized units, dispatched large numbers of air force to bomb, and even disregarded humanity by repeatedly releasing poison gas and making every effort to attack, they ultimately failed. Now, the enemy forces on the south bank of the Wenzaobang, after being severely attacked by us head-on, have collapsed to the edge of the river, and their combat power has almost been completely lost. It is expected that the enemy will continue to reinforce and risk everything, but we have already strengthened our defenses, and the enemy's spirit is flagging, so there is no problem. In short, in the two months since our soldiers have been bravely resisting, the enemy's deaths are no less than 30,000, and the number of wounded is twice that. Many tanks and armored vehicles were destroyed by our explosives or bombed by our flat-shooting machine guns, and a large number of other weapons and supplies were abandoned during the retreat. Now that the enemy has no way to succeed, it is only resorting to indiscriminate bombing, harming the innocent and only increasing international animosity. It can be seen that as long as our country resolutely resists and fights the enemy to the end, the time of the enemy's internal collapse will be the day we achieve final victory.</p>
<h3>Methods for Rewarding Donors of Cotton Vests</h3>
<p>Cotton Vest Sizes and Styles Can Be Requested from the慰劳会</p>
<p>The Anti-Enemy Support Association of All Circles in this city and various public organizations have recently raised 200,000 cotton vests and telegraphed the Chief of the Garrison Command to send personnel to transport them so that they can be distributed to the soldiers for use. Yesterday, the following reply telegram was received: "Geng telegram received with respect. The 200,000 cotton vests have been diligently raised by you, and we deeply appreciate your noble generosity. In addition to transferring the order to send personnel to quickly negotiate for collection, please send a list of those who have contributed to the fundraising to Beijing so that they can be presented to the Committee for reward, to spread the news of righteousness. The war of resistance will be long, and there will be many places where we will rely on your assistance in the future. With sincerity and gratitude." The chairman's group of the association resolved: ㊀ Those who donate 500 or more cotton vests will be issued a letter of thanks by the association; ㊁ Those who donate 1,000 or more will be reported to the government for commendation; ㊂ Those who donate 10,000 or more will be reported to the government for special reward.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai慰劳 Committee, in order to standardize the size and style of cotton vests and strive for military uniformity, has also designed cotton vest sizes and styles, which have now been printed. In addition to clearly indicating the sizes for large, medium, and small sizes, there are also drawings with explanations. They can be requested in person or by mail from the committee.</p>

We know that Mr. Lu Xun is the greatest and strongest national warrior of the Chinese nation. In order to coordinate the work of commemorating Mr. Lu Xun with the current needs of the war of resistance, and in order to hope that every soldier at the front who is killing the enemy will learn from Mr. Lu Xun's forever unyielding spirit of struggle, the Youth National Salvation Service Corps has launched the '10,000 Lu Xun Cotton Vests Campaign.' In this way, we can use Lu Xun's spirit to inspire the soldiers at the front and use the work of慰劳ing the soldiers to comfort the eternally resting Mr. Lu Xun. People who commemorate Mr. Lu Xun, people who help the soldiers fighting at the front, please unanimously support this movement. The collection point of the corps is at No. 311 Youth, Baxianqiao."</p>
<h3>War Diary (6)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chen Wanli of the Central News Agency accompanying the army</p>
<p>October 12</p>
<p>When I woke up in the morning, it was drizzling again, but soon the rain cleared and the sun shone brightly.</p>
<p>Today, enemy planes bombed the Zhabei area fiercely, but what was the result? The enemy only wasted ammunition, and we suffered no damage.</p>
<p>The battle unfolded on all fronts, and fierce fighting continued on the south bank of the Wenzaobang River. On the evening of the 5th and the morning of the 6th, the enemy on the north bank of the Wenzaobang River forcibly crossed the river under intense artillery fire. The enemy paid a heavy price, but managed to cross successfully at three locations. To this day, the two river crossings east of the Shanghai-Tai Highway have been largely wiped out after our continuous encirclement and suppression. Only the area west of the Shanghai-Tai Highway, including the Hei Da Huang residence, the Ba Fang residence, and the Zhou residence, remains the stronghold of the enemy's main force and the focus of the current battle. The enemy's ambition is great, attempting to realize their central breakthrough strategy here. But finally today, they launched a major battle and suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>The enemy who crossed the river west of the Shanghai-Tai Highway once advanced eastward on the 9th, attempting to attack the rear of our troops stationed in Miaohang and Jiangwan, but the result was failure. Yesterday, the enemy changed direction and advanced westward, attempting to go straight to Nanxiang, but the result was again failure. At dawn today, the enemy concentrated their main force and launched a fierce southward attack, attempting to cross the Dadaochang area and capture Zhenru, completing their large encirclement, but what was the result? Still failure.</p>
<p>Large numbers of enemies, at dawn today, under the cover of concentrated artillery fire, launched a fierce southward attack. We took advantage of the situation to lure the enemy deep. Until about 9:00 a.m., the enemy had penetrated deep into the Dadaochang area. Then, our frontal troops immediately launched a counterattack, and the left and right troops also launched a fierce flanking attack. The enemy was in a three-sided encirclement, having lost the time and space to escape and collapse, and were completely annihilated by us. This bloody battle continued until the evening, and we had forced the remaining enemy back to the riverbank.</p>
<p>This may be the general offensive that the enemy's commander-in-chief, General Matsui, called "breaking the Chinese army's resistance," but it only became the finale of the enemy's fourth general offensive. Now, the enemy on the Wenzaobang Riverbank is completely under our control and has no ability to counterattack at all. This is the greatest victory we have achieved during the enemy's fourth general offensive.</p>
<p>I recall that the enemy at Dongyangzhai on the north bank of the Wenzaobang River crossed the river on the morning of the 6th. That evening, our army launched a fierce counterattack in the rain, killing more than 200 enemy soldiers, one of whom was Lieutenant Kozuka, attached to the 12th Company of the 101st Infantry Regiment of the enemy. At the same time, we also captured the Abe Unit's flag and many other war trophies. These items have all been submitted here and today were captured in the lens by a lucky photographer, and will probably be seen on the screen soon.</p>
<p>I am also one of the lucky ones. Today, I saw these war trophies here, including one Abe Unit flag and four Japanese flags presented by the Japanese people, all with the words "Banzai," "Iron of a Hundred Refinements," "Patriotic Volunteer Army," and "Long Live Military Fortune" written on them. Alas, the "military fortune" was "not long" lasting. These flags have all become our war trophies.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two diaries, one order pouch, one roster, and three maps of Fahua Town and other places in Shanghai. These maps, printed by the "Shanghai Expeditionary Army Headquarters," the "Land Survey Department," and the "General Staff Headquarters," can be said to be extremely detailed. Here, we can also see that the enemy had been preparing for the invasion of Shanghai for a long time.</p>
<p>Most strangely, we also captured one copy each of "Infantry Drill Regulations," "Combat Outline," "Regulations on Essential Matters in the Field," "Infantry Shooting Manual," and "Experiences of Non-Commissioned Officers and Soldiers in Health during Mobilization." It is already a miracle to read "Experiences in Health" in the trenches, and to read "Infantry Drill Regulations," "Combat Outline," and "Shooting Manual" on the front lines is ridiculous. I finally asked this question, and after the explanation of a young senior military officer who had just returned from an inspection in Japan, I suddenly understood. It turns out that these officers and soldiers are all newly recruited, so even though they have already reached the front lines, they still have to read these "Combat Outlines" and "Shooting Manuals," probably hoping to find a way to "return alive to Tokyo." Alas, these Japanese citizens, perhaps before they had finished reading the outlines and manuals, had already been driven by the warlords and sacrificed meaninglessly in a foreign country, and even their remains could not be transported back to their homeland.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Ordered to Investigate the Damage to Cultural Institutions</h3>
<p>Notifications have been sent to all cultural institutions and schools to report</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Social Bureau issued a notice to all levels of schools and educational and cultural institutions, stating, "Based on the Ministry of Education's telegram of October 9, 1937, 'The circumstances of the destruction of schools and educational and cultural institutions in various places by enemy forces since the outbreak of the war, as well as the extent of the damage, should be recorded in detail and reported by the Bureau within seven days of receiving this document, with photos attached as appropriate. Any similar situations in the future should also be reported as they occur.' Therefore, we hereby urgently notify all levels of schools and educational and cultural institutions in the city to describe the circumstances of the destruction in detail, estimate the value of the losses, and attach photos as appropriate within three days, so that we can compile and submit a report. Failure to do so will not be tolerated. This is a special notice."</p>
<h3>West Shanghai United Benefit Association Organizes Registration of Female Workers for Cotton Mills</h3>
<p>After the resumption of operations of the Chinese-owned cotton mills in West Shanghai, work is extremely busy, and night shifts have been added one after another. It is understood that these factories are currently short of manpower and plan to recruit a large number of female workers for coarse and fine yarn rooms. Several factories have entrusted the West Shanghai United Benefit Association to recruit on their behalf. In addition to the association introducing the first batch of more than one hundred female workers to work, it will also organize the registration of female cotton mill workers starting today. Regardless of whether they have worked or not, they can go to the association at Chengde Fang, Gordon Road, West Shanghai, to fill out a form and request registration and introduction.</p>

<p>For the convenience of patriotic compatriots from other places sending donations, the Shanghai Comfort Committee will, if cash is handed over to banks or post offices to be remitted to the Comfort Committee on Yu Qiaqing Road, Shanghai, in addition to sending a receipt back, if the donor specifies that the funds be used to purchase cotton vests, first aid kits, or anti-Japanese shoes, the committee will immediately handle it according to the donor's wishes and send them to the front lines, to comfort the soldiers fighting against the war.</p>
<h3>China &amp; Western Dispensary Donates Large Quantities of Medicines</h3>
<p>And Dispatches Many People to Serve in Various Places</p>
<p>The various armies fighting in Shanghai are extremely courageous. The Shanghai Comfort Committee requested the China &amp; Western Dispensary to donate medicines needed by the armies. The pharmacy donated a large batch of morphine injections, anesthetic ether, China &amp; Western Soda Water, pharmaceutical White Brandy, Red Magic Pills, Fantongning, and other medicines of great value. In addition to the committee handing them over, it also sent a letter of thanks to the pharmacy. It is reported that during this war of resistance, all senior staff members of the China &amp; Western Dispensary were dispatched by General Manager Zhou Bangjun to serve in various places, and all salaries were borne by the China &amp; Western Dispensary. For example, Wang Huiwu, Wang Yizhi, and Zhang Qimei were sent to the Chinese Red Cross, Zhou Wentong and others were sent to the Relief Committee, Fang Pingfan and others were sent to the Comfort Committee, and people were also dispatched to the National Salvation Public Bonds Solicitation Committee.</p>
<h3>Swire Company Increases Sailings on the Shanghai-Tongzhou Route</h3>
<p>Connecting Wuhu and Wuxue, Connecting to Shipping Between Jinghan</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, traffic between Shanghai and the Jiangbei area has been interrupted due to the suspension of operations of the Dada and Datong Companies, which originally operated the Shanghai-Yangzhou route. The British-owned Swire Company has now decided to increase sailings on this route to maintain water traffic between Shanghai and northern Jiangsu. The Wuhu and Wuxue ships have been assigned to operate on a regular schedule, with Nantong designated as the terminus, connecting to the company's ships sailing in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Therefore, passengers and cargo traveling from Shanghai to Jinghan can also take this route to Tongzhou and transfer.</p>
<p>Six Tram Lines Resume Operation</p>
<p>After the Shanghai battle, tram lines 6, 9, and 7 were suspended due to the piles of sandbags under the Zhejiang Road Bridge. Now that the authorities have removed this obstacle, tram line 6 has resumed operation, with the route running from the Bund on Guangdong Road to the First Special District Court.</p>
<p>European Mail Delivered via Saigon</p>

<h3>Remnants of the Enemy at Wenzaobang Attempt to Resist Stubbornly; I Use Tanks to Annihilate the Enemy on Xiangyin Road</h3>
<p>My Artillery Shells North Sichuan Road, Killing More Than 100 Enemies; My Troops Charge on Guangdong Street, and the Enemy Collapses in Disarray; Enemy Troops at Luodian Stir with Malice, but Are Blocked and Attacked by Me</p>
<p>On the 12th, the enemy army, with all its strength, attempted a central breakthrough on my left-wing position west of the Shanghai-Tai Highway north of Tangqiao. Although they penetrated deeply for a time, they were flanked by my three routes. The enemy suffered more than 6,000 casualties and were forced to flee and hide along the banks of the Hei Da Huang residence area. Isolated and exhausted, they were unable to do anything. The enemy then shifted their gaze and invaded my right flank, attempting to spy on my Miaohang from Yanjiawan. Another route attacked my Jiangwan position from the Sijing Stadium. Yesterday's fierce battle continued unabated, and the enemy finally could not hold on and retreated. In the evening, the enemy in the Yanjiawan area again attacked my Caojiazhai, but after my courageous resistance, the enemy still did not succeed. On the Zhabei front, starting last night, the enemy launched a fierce attack on my Baoshan Road from Qiujiang Branch Road. The fierce battle continued all night. Starting at dawn this morning, enemy planes continued to sortie and indiscriminately bombed, threatening my army to assist their infantry in advancing, but my army was unusually calm and responded resolutely. The position was as stable as Mount Tai, and the enemy was unable to find an opportunity. On the Luodian front, last night, a large enemy regiment launched a fierce attack on Zhujiazhai but failed. On the Jiangwan front, there was no fierce fighting last night or this morning.</p>
<p>It is confirmed that the fierce fighting in the Zhabei area and Dadaochang did not stop on the night of the 13th. The sounds of heavy artillery, mortars, machine guns, and rifles continued without interruption. There were also machine gun sounds along the Huangpu River, as dense as a string of pearls. Many artillery shells fell on Zha Pu Road (near Peng Road and Bazilu) and Haining Road on Wusong Road. From 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. this morning, the artillery battle was quite fierce near the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road. The sound of machine guns was very dense in the Yokohama Bridge area. At about 8:00 a.m., enemy planes bombed my army along the railway line about a quarter of a mile southwest of the North Station, and high-射砲 artillery was fired. At the same time, there were small boats full of enemy troops in the Huangpu River, exchanging gunfire with my army on the Lujiazui side. Enemy warships also fired artillery, which stopped at 9:00 a.m. Enemy planes dropped bombs in the Xingzhong Road area east and northeast of the MacKay Road Station. Artillery shells often fell at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Bazilu.</p>
<p>My military intelligence reported that the enemy side had spread news that although the enemy army had launched a full-scale attack on the positions at Luodian, Liuhang, Gujiazhai, and Tangqiao, they had made no progress. Therefore, they are now concentrating their full force to attack southward along the Tangqiao River in order to occupy Dadaochang and contain Zhabei. The enemy's headquarters has already strictly ordered the attacking troops at Jiangwan and Tangqiao to occupy Dadaochang before the 15th of this month (i.e., tomorrow). This conspiracy was discovered by our side long ago, so we are heavily guarded and determined to meet them head-on.</p>
<h3>I Use Tanks to Charge on Xiangyin Road</h3>
<p>Destroy One Enemy Vehicle and Kill More Than 80 Enemies; The Enemy Collapses in Disarray and Cowers, Afraid to Offend Again</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter accompanying the army in Jiangwan reported at 12:15 p.m. on the 14th that the enemy and my side were using tanks to cover the troops and launch assault attacks on Xiangyin Road. My side had a clear advantage. At about 4:00 a.m., the enemy saw that the situation was critical and immediately dispatched three teams of tanks from Jiangwan Road to attack my rear. I immediately divided my troops to meet them. My mechanized artillery vehicles also combined firepower to bombard the enemy. One enemy vehicle was immediately destroyed, and more than 80 enemies were killed. As for Ye's Garden and its American Road at Fudan University, after my continuous attacks, they advanced and retreated in front of the enemy's position, rising and falling suddenly, with more than 17 contacts by dawn. The enemy troops inside Fudan University cowered and did not dare to attack, but their tanks were still active.</p>
<h3>My Army Shells North Sichuan Road</h3>
<p>Killing More Than 170 Enemies</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter accompanying the army in Zhabei reported at 12:15 p.m. on the 14th that the enemy army had been continuously shelling my Zhabei with artillery yesterday. At about 1:30 a.m. this morning, my army's artillery also exerted its power and gave them a painful blow. I first aimed at the area around the Japanese elementary school on North Sichuan Road. At that time, a team of enemy troops was gathering there. Seeing my artillery shells flying over, the order was disrupted, and they fled in disarray. However, huge shells continued to fly over, hitting 17 of them, killing about 170 enemies. Then I shifted my target and bombarded the Hongkou Park area, also causing heavy damage to the enemy. By dawn, an artillery battle had ceased.</p>
<h3>Remnants of the Enemy at Wenzaobang Resist Stubbornly</h3>
<p>Reinforcements Are Deployed for Another Counterattack; They Are Painfully Defeated by Me and Ultimately Fail</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter accompanying the army reported at 10:30 a.m. on the 14th that the enemy gathered on the south bank of the Wenzaobang River west of the Shanghai-Tai Road, after being miserably defeated in their southward advance on the 12th, were forced by me to retreat to the Hei Da Huang residence, the Ba Fang residence, the Yang residence, and the Huangjiachi area. Yesterday, they reorganized their remnants and did not dare to attack all day. Last night, the enemy again sent a large number of reinforcements to reinforce the area and once advanced on me, but was repelled by my army. Before dawn this morning, the enemy launched a dense artillery barrage at me. After dawn, several enemy planes flew over and bombed. Enemy infantry, under the cover of planes and artillery fire, used tanks as the vanguard and launched a fierce attack on me. The fierce battle continued until 10:00 a.m. My army was unusually calm, waiting for the enemy to approach, and then fired with dense machine guns and attacked the enemy with hand grenades. The enemy's tanks were also under the threat of my direct-fire guns and could not run rampant. My army's position was solid, and the enemy was determined not to succeed.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops at Luodian Stir with Malice</h3>
<p>A Fierce Encounter Occurs at Zhujiazhai</p>
<p>The war on the Luodian front has been quiet for several days. Now, the enemy troops in that area are stirring with malice again. At about 11:00 p.m. on the 13th, a large enemy regiment launched an attack on my position at Zhujiazhai (2 kilometers west of Luodian), and a fierce encounter occurred with my army. The fierce battle is still going on this morning.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Again Open Fire on Pudong</h3>
<p>Enemy Small Boats Also Open Machine Guns, but Ultimately Lack the Courage to Approach the Shore</p>
<p>At 7:30 a.m. this morning (the 14th), an enemy small boat near the Izumo warship, originally a buoy No. 2, suddenly sailed inland to the Pudong side of Lujiazui, tied the cable to the buoy, and then fired machine guns fiercely at my Pudong. My Pudong garrison then returned fire with rifles. Seeing that I was prepared, the enemy boat soldiers, in addition to prostrating themselves in the boat, had another person crawl to the bow of the boat to untie the cable. When fleeing outwards, they still frequently rocked the machine guns back and forth to shoot at the land. At this time, the enemy destroyer No. 21, anchored at the Mitsubishi Wharf, fired with flat-trajectory artillery on the Lujiazui area, firing one shell per minute, firing a total of more than 40 minutes. For a time, the rumbling sound, mixed with the popping sound of machine guns, shocked the world. At 9:20 a.m., the enemy boat that had fled earlier returned to the Lujiazui side and fired machine guns at me again. My garrison ignored them. After the enemy peered remotely with binoculars for a long time, they ultimately lacked the courage to approach the shore. The boat then sailed away disappointedly.</p>
<h3>Nanshi and Pudong Are Both Subjected to Air Raids</h3>
<p>Firing Guns and Scattering Absurd Leaflets</p>
<p>Three enemy behemoth aircraft circled over the Nanshi area this morning, and flew low over the South Station to reconnoiter, and fired machine guns for five minutes. Fortunately, there were no passengers at the South Station, so there were no injuries. Then, the enemy planes flew to the Gaoyuanmiao and Xiejiao areas and dropped absurd leaflets, full of seduction, but the public tore them up one after another, never giving them a second glance. The enemy planes flew westward all the way to the Xinji, Hongqiao Road, and Robegen Road areas in northwestern Shanghai to bomb, and also opened fire and sprayed in the Xieshi Road and Caohejing areas in southern Shanghai. A huge bomb was seen dropped near Tushanwan, and the sound was very loud. Citizens in Nanshi suspected that a nearby market had been bombed, so there was once a commotion, but after investigation, the shell landed in the countryside and did no damage.</p>
<p>At about 9:00 a.m. this morning, two enemy planes flew to Bailianjing and Hu-Nan Hu-Min Road in Pudong to reconnoiter and fired machine guns downwards from time to time. After half an hour, they turned northeast and flew away. Afterwards, they also opened machine guns along the way in Pudong.</p>
<h3>Fragments of Enemy Artillery Shells Fall on American Flagship</h3>
<p>The American Naval Commander Lodges a Protest; Hasegawa Officially Sends Personnel to Apologize</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report, this morning at about 9:00 a.m., the enemy destroyer No. 21, anchored at the Mitsubishi Wharf, suddenly opened fire on the Lujiazui, Lujiadu, and Chunjiang Wharf areas, firing artillery. At 9:03 a.m., a piece of shrapnel fell on the American flagship USS Augusta, anchored at the New Customs Wharf, injuring a third-class radio operator, Michael Mitchell. The commander of the US Far East Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, immediately protested to the Japanese side. It is reported that the Japanese side has already sent personnel to represent Mr. Hasegawa to formally apologize to the US side. In addition, several British warships were anchored inside the New Customs Wharf and were also hit by shrapnel, but since no one was injured, no action was taken.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Zhabei This Morning</h3>
<p>Our Troops on Guangdong Road Charge Forward, Covered in Blood; Planes and Artillery Bombard Continuously; Part of the Railway Bureau Building Destroyed</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Zhabei Frontline Correspondent, Yesterday, 1:20 PM) - Starting at 5:00 AM this morning, over twenty enemy planes were active in the skies over Zhabei. The bombs they dropped were even more numerous than yesterday. Their bombing targets remained the Tanzigou, Gonghe Road, Baoshan Road, and Dongbaoxing Road areas. According to observations, the enemy is likely to become active on this line, and a major battle will unfold within days. Furthermore, in the Qujiaqiao area of Jiangwan Road, several enemy tanks have repeatedly driven towards the Baziqiao Shuidian Road area to reconnoiter, indicating that the enemy will launch a large-scale offensive. However, our troops are on high alert.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Continues in Zhabei This Morning</p>
<p>Starting early this morning, the enemy infantry at Baziqiao, the Japanese Cemetery, the No. 63 Garden, Jiangwan Road, the enemy naval landing force headquarters in Zhabei, and along North Sichuan Road continuously harassed our army's positions. Small cannons frequently sounded, and machine guns chattered non-stop. Our troops calmly responded, waiting for the enemy to approach before emerging from trenches and retaliating with hand grenades and machine guns, inflicting considerable setbacks on the enemy. The fierce fighting continued until noon. Moreover, the enemy troops frequently used artillery to bombard civilian houses. Our troops, under intense enemy aerial bombardment, calmly resisted, regardless of everything.</p>
<p>Our Troops Advance Towards North Sichuan Road</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Zhabei Frontline Correspondent, 12:15 PM, 14th) - At approximately 2:00 AM this morning, under a hazy moonlight, our troops attacked from the Guangdong Road area. After our forces cleared the enemy outposts, they launched a fierce assault on North Sichuan Road from various alleyways. A large contingent of enemy troops rushed to defend, triggering intense fighting. Our troops charged out through the rain of bullets and engaged in numerous hand-to-hand combats with the enemy, gaining a considerable advantage. They occupied the streets leading to North Sichuan Road and continued to advance towards North Sichuan Road in street fighting for about three hours.</p>
<p>Planes and Artillery Bombard Zhabei</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Zhabei Frontline Correspondent, 1:05 AM, 14th) - Over twenty enemy planes circled and reconnoitered over Zhabei all day yesterday, dropping bombs in shifts. Moreover, the enemy's artillery bombarded continuously, with the situation being even more intense than the past two days. The stately Railway Bureau Building also suffered one hit each on its east, west, and north sides, destroying a corner. As for other civilian houses, even more were destroyed.</p>
<p>Starting at approximately 6:00 AM this morning, another large number of enemy planes, divided into teams of three, bombed the Pengpu New Bridge, Pengpu Railway Station, and Dachang Town areas along the Shanghai-Tai Automobile Road northwest of Zhabei. After 8:00 AM, enemy planes, in teams of three or merged into teams of two, brazenly dropped heavy bombs everywhere in Zhabei. Each time they dropped bombs, it was at least three or four, or eight or nine at a time. As a result, the sounds of explosions shook the entire city of Shanghai. In the Public Concession along Suzhou Creek, on Xinzha Road and Beijing Road, the buildings shook every time enemy planes dropped bombs, and the glass windows rattled. They occasionally used machine guns to strafe.</p>
<p>Our Anti-Aircraft Artillery Demonstrates Its Power</p>
<p>Because the enemy's attacks on our left flank were unsuccessful, they have been changing their strategy in recent days, attacking our lines in Zhabei and indiscriminately bombing with planes and artillery. However, we had made preparations early on. Although the enemy attacked with full force, they ultimately suffered heavy losses and retreated. In addition to strengthening troop strength on all lines, our military authorities have also enhanced air defense capabilities and equipped themselves with the latest anti-aircraft weapons. Therefore, when three enemy planes intruded into our Zhabei defense zone this morning, the air defense units immediately fired with anti-aircraft artillery and anti-aircraft machine guns. Although the enemy planes flew back and forth in the sky, their altitude was always above ten thousand meters. Whenever our anti-aircraft artillery fired, the three planes that had gathered would immediately separate, and they dared not approach. Therefore, although enemy planes continue to be active, they are no longer as rampant as they were a few days ago.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Plans to Use Mediation First in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>If Unsuccessful, It Will Further Sever Economic Relations with Japan; American Labor Unions Decide to Boycott Japanese Goods Together with British Labor Unions</p>
<p>[Washington] After President Roosevelt delivered his radio address yesterday, those in charge gave an explanation, saying that the purpose was twofold: ⑴ Regarding the Far East issue, given the history of the European War, the public deeply fears that President Roosevelt will repeat the mistakes of former President Wilson. Therefore, Roosevelt delivered a speech to reassure people, stating briefly that he is well aware of the public's unease. However, he had served in President Wilson's government (President Roosevelt had served as Undersecretary of the Navy), and based on his personal experience, he knows how to avoid past mistakes. ⑵ Regarding the mission of the upcoming Nine-Power Treaty Conference, President Roosevelt explained in yesterday's speech the views held by the U.S. government. In essence, the primary task of this conference is to find a way to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute. According to information received by the State Department, although the attitude of the Japanese military remains as firm as ever, it is also possible that the Japanese government may accept a compromise. Current U.S. policy is based on this hope, and therefore, before taking practical coercive measures, it has been decided to exhaust all mediation methods in order to find a solution. If mediation at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference fails, then the U.S. government will naturally further consider practical methods, such as severing trade relations with Japan. However, before taking this method, the U.S. government must obtain guarantees that after U.S. exporters cease trade with Japan, other countries will not take the opportunity to replace them. In short, President Roosevelt intends to explain that although the U.S. is currently cooperating with other countries, it will be within the framework of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and limited to the Sino-Japanese dispute. The U.S. has no intention of taking joint action with other countries on other international issues. As for the U.S. government's attitude towards the development of the current tense situation in the Mediterranean, it is still closely monitoring it. (Central News Agency, Havas report, 13th)</p>
<p>⊙ Denver, USA. At today's annual meeting of the American Federation of Labor, in order to retaliate against the Japanese's barbaric and systematic massacre of Chinese people in China, it was unanimously voted to join the British labor's movement to boycott Japanese goods. A report was also passed, indicating its purpose of expanding the boycott movement beyond the borders of the UK and the US, uniting with labor unions in other countries to act in unison. The report also acknowledges that the cooperative actions of all peace-loving countries are a necessary condition for preventing unjustified acts of aggression, but "the American people and the free labor movement are determined not to purchase Japanese goods under the current circumstances, so as not to increase Japan's financial resources." Speaking at the meeting today were Federation of Labor President Green and Vice President Wool. (Central News Agency, Reuters report, 13th)</p>
<p>[London] Although the main item discussed at today's British Cabinet meeting was the Mediterranean issue, the Far East incident was also discussed at length. It is reported that cabinet members still expressed their original views at the meeting, namely that economic sanctions against Japan are not practical under the current circumstances. (Central News Agency, Reuters report, 13th)</p>
<p>⊙ Ottawa. Canadian Prime Minister King announced today that Canada is prepared to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. It is expected that the conference can be held in Brussels within two weeks. (Central News Agency, Reuters report, 14th)</p>
<p>[London] The Chinese Embassy in the UK recently released a declaration signed by Dr. Aidinger, Director of Surgery at the Nanjing Red Cross Hospital, and Dr. Borcic, representative of the League of Nations Health Organization in China. The content states that they had examined many Chinese wounded soldiers and firmly believe that "the various wounded soldiers are suffering from some kind of blistering substance, roughly mustard gas, which is emitted by bombs or artillery shells." (Central News Agency, Havas report, 13th)</p>
<p>⊙ Beijing. Mrs. Yang Hucheng, wife of General Yang Hucheng, the former Pacification Commissioner of Shaanxi Province, arrived here today. Representatives from the Chinese student association and the Chinese community association greeted her at the station. It is reported that General Yang Hucheng himself is currently on official business in Madrid. (Central News Agency, report, 13th)</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attack Beijing This Morning, Repelled by Our Air Force</h3>
<p>Several Bombs Dropped Outside the City, No Losses; Zhenjiang and Liuhe Areas Also Bombed</p>
<p>[Nanjing] At 9:30 this morning, an enemy air raid alert was issued in the city. At approximately 11:00 AM, six enemy bombers came roaring in, flying to the southeast skies outside the city and dropping six bombs at the Grand Parade Ground, causing no losses. The enemy planes were then bravely attacked by our air force and fled in panic. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Eleven enemy planes flew from the east and west at 9:00 AM on the 14th, attempting to attack Beijing. Our air force, upon hearing the report, immediately flew to intercept. Six enemy planes took the opportunity to detour and intrude into Beijing's airspace. By the time our air force returned, the enemy had hurriedly dropped over ten bombs outside Guanghua Gate and left. Our air force did not pursue. The remaining five enemy planes flew to Zhenjiang, Danyang, Qixia Mountain, Liuhe, and Jurong, dropping bombs. The extent of the losses is under investigation.

<p>[Nanjing] Japanese planes attacked Nanjing again this morning, flying in the sky for a very short time. Their attention was focused on the airfield outside Guanghua Gate. At 10:00 AM, several Japanese heavy bombers, the exact number unknown, flew in from the southeast. However, they were flying extremely high. Although the sky was cloudless and the sun was bright, one could not see them even by looking up. One could only see white smoke swirling and hear the sound of anti-aircraft shells exploding, thereby identifying the location of the Japanese planes. After dropping several bombs on the airfield outside Guanghua Gate, the Japanese planes hurriedly fled, apparently seeing seven Chinese fighters taking off. The alert was lifted at 10:45 AM.

<h3>Brief Commentary</h3>
<p>— Physiognomy</p>
<p>A Japanese spokesman said that Japan's use of force against China stemmed from self-defense. Roosevelt's remarks and the U.S. government's declaration showed a lack of understanding. What is he saying? The so-called self-defense refers to defending one's land, defending one's sovereignty, and defending one's people and property. Now that the enemy has invaded our North China and forcibly occupied our Shanghai, they call it self-defense. I wonder what kind of explanation they have for the term self-defense. Could it be that the enemy's interpretation of self-defense is unique to the world?</p>
<p>The enemy invades our North China and forcibly occupies our Shanghai, and calls it self-defense. Then how should our country's resistance war be explained? Roosevelt's remarks and the U.S. government's declaration truly grasp the spirit of self-defense. If the world were full of Japan's kind of forceful reasoning and became international robbers, how could the United States maintain an isolationist policy and enjoy peace? Therefore, President Roosevelt delivered a fireside chat the previous evening, saying that if basic morality is not respected, all countries will suffer. To eliminate the scourge of war and preserve civilization, one cannot stand idly by. These words deeply grasp the correct understanding of the term self-defense.</p>

Our soldiers fought to the death with flesh and blood. Both brigade commanders Tang and Lin were injured, and regimental commander Wang Chenggui was killed in battle. Regimental commanders Liu and Xu were also injured. More than half of the battalion commanders and below made heroic sacrifices.

<h3>A Glimpse of the Devastation in Jiading</h3>
<p>The County Seat and Various Towns Have All Been Turned into Scorched Earth; Enemy Planes Indiscriminately Drop Bombs with Extreme Brutality</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, Jiading was occupied by Japanese invaders. This time, with the outbreak of the "August 13th" Songhu Anti-Japanese War, Jiading naturally remained the enemy's desired target. Nanxiang is the leading town of Jiading, with prosperous markets and comparable to the county seat. Since August 15th, it has been bombed by the enemy dozens of times, with over two hundred bombs dropped. Half of the houses have been destroyed. Jiading City, on the other hand, was first bombed west of Houhuang Bridge on August 18th, and was bombed all day on the 23rd, with a total of over twenty bombs dropped. At that time, the enemy had already landed at Xiaochuansha, arriving at Luodian Town, which borders Baoshan County, in the afternoon. Upon hearing the news, the residents fled. The county government officials had also fled that morning. At that time, the county government had been hit by two bombs. County Magistrate Guo Mingxin and First Section Chief Deng Bizhou initially remained at the county government, but fled to the western countryside at 5:00 PM. From then on, this fortified city, six li in length and width, was bombed by enemy planes every day, with approximately three hundred bombs dropped. On the morning of October 7th, the reporter went to observe, and the scene was utterly devastated, too horrible to behold. West of Houhuang Bridge outside the West Gate, the road had a hole blown in it. To the south, the Jiafeng Yarn Factory was hit by four bombs, destroying a small part of the machinery. Several bombs landed near the bus station, all in the fields. To the west of Qiu Bridge, two houses of Tao Wuniu's residence in Henan were destroyed. To the east of Qiu Bridge, in Henan, a corner of the ancestral hall of Gu Weijun, China's chief representative to the League of Nations, was destroyed. The entire residence of the Jiang family next door was destroyed. Across the river, the residences of the Huang family and the Xiangfang and Huang Zixiong residences were hit by bombs. Further east, on Xiaojie Street, the Chengtailong and Huang Huiji stores were destroyed. On Dajie Street, the Zhao Chengtailong Xing Tong Xinyi Fish Store, Zhu Hengmao Xingzhuang Jinsheng Meat Store, Cheng Peiqing Residence, etc., have all collapsed. Even more tragic, by a certain tree west of Qiu Bridge along the river, a person's waist and abdomen were blown apart, with flesh and blood sticking to the tree. The head and chest were bent and pressed to the ground, too horrible to look at. There are guards at the city gates, allowing good citizens to enter and exit, but they are not allowed to take anything out of the city, to prevent theft as the residents of the city have moved away. The streets inside the city are overgrown with weeds. Fewer than a thousand people live there, deserted and lonely, almost unrecognizable as the bustling place it once was. County Magistrate Guo Mingxin and Police Chief Hui Jin, after fleeing west out of the city, sent a telegram to the provincial government, but it failed to reach them for several days. The provincial government, believing that they had abandoned their posts, dismissed them and ordered them to report to the province for punishment. The newly appointed County Magistrate Zhang Beisheng and Police Chief Xu Damo are working hard to maintain order. The county government and police station are connected and have been hit by over twenty bombs. The screen wall, main gate, prison workshop, tax collection office, judicial office, office building, part of the West Park, and the police station have all been destroyed. Other destroyed buildings include the rear of Chang Le on East Dajie Street, the front of Deyuelou, Qian Changxiang, Zhengyuanxiang, Huangxing Warehouse, Qian Changxiang, Henggu Clothing Store, and the Dim Sum Shop at the Dongpo Bridge Pier (the above six places burned down). Further east, the Mori Mao, Liang Ji's Residence, Xu Renchang Rongbi Zhou Residence, Gaoshengguan, the rear of Daquanren, the Zhou Laoxiang Residence, Wannianchun, Longchang, Zhaojia Hall, Wu Rongxing, Guanjialong Church, Kuancun Office, Chen Bingda Residence, the rear of Dongcang, Zhu Jintong Residence, the rear of Ge Yitang Residence, Liciao Bridge, Yangshubang on East Xiaojie Street, Wang Zhixiang, Fugan Workshop, Gu Jingqiu Residence, Feng Yongbin Residence, Zhang Songnian Residence, Zhu Er's Residence, Wuyi Quan Brick Ash Store, Yichangyong, Gongping, Central Barber Shop, the rear of Dingxin, Zhengchang Qian, Guohua, Yixin Grocery Store, Rattan Chair Shop, Yuanmao southward to Shejuxing on South Dajie Street (the above burned down). A part of Nande Pawn Shop on Zhangma Street South, Zhou Residence, the opposite of the Kuiyou School Gate, Xu Residence, Shen Ruixing Residence, Liao Jianan Residence, Shen Youzhi Residence, Kongzi Temple Guanwu, He Ruiqing Residence, Zhang Xingzhi Residence, the middle part of Dai Xiwu Residence, Li Rizitang, Zhao Dingquan Residence, Taoge (the study of the local martyr Huang Tao'an), Wang Bingzhong Residence, Rulong on West Dajie Street, Wenji Tea Shop, Dai Junzhai Residence, Xu Peiyun Residence, Shi Xingwu Residence, Yin Yisun Residence, Ge E'hua Hall, Ge Zoudetang, part of the County Party Headquarters, part of Yu Junxi's Residence, Xiao Hanjiang Residence, the rear of Li Hengmao, the Great King Temple, Zhang Baiyin's Residence on West Xiaojie Street (burned down), the Two-Five Building of the Ordinary School, Xueyuan, Zhang Zixian Residence, Zhu Yijun Residence, Hardware Cooperative Factory, Huang Chehou Residence, the Auditorium of Chengde School and its opposite, the Liji Society, Taihetang on North Dajie Street, Wang Quanli, Rongxingguan, Wankang, Barber Shop, Futai, Fengji, Hou Boping Residence, Wu Jinkang Residence (burned down), Gu Borong Residence, Chen Wu and Zhan, Gu Jianzhou Residence, Wang Quanli Zhan, Beiyicang, Yang Tairong Residence, Civilian Hospital, Junior High School Gate, Ning Shao Guild Hall on North Xiaojie Street, Gu Residence. The above are what were seen in haste. As for the losses inside and in places that were not inspected, the losses must be even greater. Leaving the city in the evening, the east, north, and south gates were not reached. It is said that those bombed outside the South Gate include Jiafeng Pig Bank, Tang Family Residence, Wu Huizhi Residence, Yong Zengyue Residence, Bus Station, etc. In the county, in addition to Nanxiang, Waigang was bombed with over twenty bombs, destroying two-thirds of the North and South Streets; Fangtai was bombed with four bombs, destroying dozens of houses including the City God Temple; Malu was hit by nine bombs, destroying dozens of civilian houses in the northern city; Ji Wang Temple was hit by over fifty bombs, destroying hundreds of civilian houses. As for Guangfu, Xuhang, the two towns, as well as Cao Wang Temple, Shi Xiangong Temple, and the villages along Yonghua Pond and Yangjing, approximately thirty li north and south, over ten thousand households of civilian houses were burned by the enemy, becoming scorched earth. The general disaster victims, whose families and property were sacrificed for the nation, all regard it as natural and do not care at all, but they have a clear understanding of the ferocious face and brutal methods of the invaders.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Bombard the Mouth of the Lumingjing River</h3>
<p>Hundreds of Shells Fall into the Rice Fields; Enemy Planes Indiscriminately Massacre Civilians</p>
<p>Taicang correspondence: Starting from the heavy rain on the evening of the 7th, enemy warships bombarded the mouth of the Lumingjing River, located between Fuqiao and Huangjing Towns, with heavy artillery. The bombardment continued until noon on the 8th. In total, hundreds of shells were fired, but they all fell into the rice fields, only destroying dozens of civilian houses inside the seawall. In the past four days, Japanese planes have been dropping bombs in various towns and villages. It is estimated that over two hundred civilians have been killed or injured in Yuewang Town, Zhangjia Market, Luhe Town, Hengtang Market, etc., and over three hundred houses have been destroyed. The cruelty of the enemy is truly hateful. As for the innocent people who were bombed to death, such as the elementary school in Yuewang Town, where over twenty children around the age of ten were killed when it was bombed during class, it is especially tragic.</p>
<h3>Wounded Soldiers Are Concerned About the War Situation</h3>
<p>Please Donate Newspapers to Various Circles</p>
<p>It has been reported from the wounded soldiers' hospital that the loyal and brave soldiers who have been wounded in our country's war of resistance are extremely concerned about the frontline battles. However, there are not many newspapers in the hospital, so they feel very isolated from the situation on the battlefield. It is hoped that residents living near various wounded soldiers' hospitals will automatically send the newspapers they have read to the nearby hospitals every day. It is best to find ways to collect more newspapers from neighbors and send them. The time for delivering newspapers is approximately from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM every day.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Mailing Parcels to Western Hunan</h3>

<h3>Procedures for Various Industries to Apply for Transportation Passports</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent letters to the trade associations of the South Goods Industry, Paper Industry, North Goods Industry, Seafood and Grocery Industry, and Transit Customs Declaration Industry, instructing them on the procedures for applying for transportation passports from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. The letter stated: "Dear sirs, regarding the transportation and sale of goods from various industries to other ports, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, this Chamber has already discussed with the various military agencies the issuance of certificates to prove this, which has been quite convenient until now. However, it has recently been reported that the Songhu Garrison Headquarters has a method for issuing transportation passports. Therefore, the following points are hereby conveyed to your association for your attention: ⑴ If your association assesses the situation and believes that there is a need to apply for transportation passports at present, you can prepare a document and directly obtain blank application forms from the Passport Section of the Rear Affairs Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for future use. ⑵ These blank application forms, when needed, should be filled out in accordance with the prescribed clauses, and then sent directly to the Passport Section by your association for application. If it is necessary for this Chamber to forward the application, then one copy of this blank application form should be filled out to facilitate separate storage and forwarding."</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Chinese Women's Mutual Aid Association</h3>
<p>The Fourteenth Rescue Hospital, sponsored by the Chinese Women's Mutual Aid Association, has achieved remarkable results. The association was initiated and founded by Madam Tian Shujun, wife of Commander Yang. The inaugural meeting was held at the Sino-German Hospital at 2:00 PM yesterday. Over a hundred people attended, including representatives from various agencies, guests, and members Yang Hu, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Jiyi, Hu Shuyi, Shi Liang, Luo Shuzhang, etc. A presidium of seven people, including Yang Tian Shujun, Cheng Yuan, and Ding Huihan, was formed, and the ceremony was conducted in accordance with protocol. First, Chairman Yang Tian Shujun delivered a speech and reported on the association's work. Then, party and government representatives and guests such as Shi Liang gave speeches, offering much encouragement. After a group photo was taken, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Letter to the Municipal Council Regarding the Refund of Vehicle License Fees</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession, yesterday sent a letter to the Secretary of the Municipal Council, stating that according to a letter from Wing On Motors: "Our branches are located on North Sichuan Road, Scott Road, and Tongji Road. During the recent outbreak of war, these areas were all war zones and bore the brunt of the fighting, resulting in the complete cessation of business. We purchased a total of seven vehicle licenses, paying a total of 243.81 yuan in national currency. After the cessation of business, we returned the licenses to the Municipal Council on August 14th, requesting a refund according to regulations. The Council stated that the licenses could not be calculated on a daily basis and that only one-third of the fee could be refunded. We then took the licenses back and returned six of them on August 25th and one on September 1st (license numbers omitted), totaling seven licenses. According to the Council's regulations, one-third of the fee should be refunded, amounting to 81.27 yuan in national currency. Despite repeated requests, the refund has been delayed. When we inquired about the reason, we were told that the Scott Road branch had not paid taxes for a long time and that the refund would be used to cover those taxes. This is very contradictory. After investigation, Scott Road is located in the Chinese territory, and our branch's taxes have always been collected by personnel from the Chinese territory, with tax receipts as proof. Furthermore, the enemy store's address is clearly marked as No. 67 by the Chinese authorities, and the landlord's address is No. 1 to No. 2. For more than ten years, the Municipal Council has never collected taxes there. The Council's forced deduction is completely unreasonable. Therefore, we are writing to you to inquire with the Municipal Council and request the prompt return of the refund, as our branch has already been affected by the war and cannot bear additional taxes. We respectfully request your assistance in this matter."</p>
<p>According to the above, the branch is located on Scott Road, and the property tax is collected by the Shanghai Municipal Government Finance Bureau. Even if we take a step back and say that the property tax is collected by the Council's Revenue Department, returning the vehicle license fee and collecting the property tax are two separate matters and cannot be combined. If we talk about deduction, then the entire Hongkou district is now in a war zone. From whom will the Revenue Department deduct all the taxes that should be paid and collected in that area? Even before the August 13th incident, a certain foreigner owed more than two million in unpaid municipal taxes. How will this huge amount of money be deducted? According to the letter, we are writing to your Council to request that you promptly instruct that the matter be handled in a reasonable manner, so as to demonstrate fairness.</p>
<h3>Chinese Women's Sports Association Collects Scraps to Make Soldiers' Shoes</h3>
<p>Currently Lacking Cotton Thread, Hoping All Sectors Will Donate Quickly</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Women's Sports Federation promoted the scrap cloth movement a few days ago, it has learned that enthusiastic patriotic compatriots from all walks of life have donated a lot of scrap cloth. Members of the association have also donated money to subsidize the refugees in making soldiers' shoes, so as to produce them in large quantities and send them to the front lines. However, cotton thread is in short supply. Anyone willing to donate can send it to the association at No. 305 Women's Bank on Nanjing Road.</p>
<h3>Liangcai School Helps Unemployed Youth</h3>
<p>Pay Attention to People's Economic Construction</p>
<p>Li Zushen, the principal of Liangcai School, is a respected elder in Shanghai who is enthusiastic about social undertakings. Recently, in view of the long-term war of resistance, which focuses on the productive forces of the people in the rear, he specially organized a Liangcai School National Products Promotion Group. In addition to the school's students, other unemployed young people can also participate. The public selection was held on the afternoon of the day before yesterday on the seventh floor of the Pudong Building. A total of 22 people were admitted and 8 were shortlisted. Specialized teachers are hired to teach relevant subjects every day in the morning and evening. From 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., they intern at the China National Products Company. When the reporter visited, 21 members of the group had been distributed to various departments of the company for internships, and they were extremely attentive in serving customers, as if they had been well trained. The reporter was very impressed. It is said that after a considerable period of internship, they will start to set off across the city. Their missions are: ① To promote excellent national products, ② To promote national salvation bonds, ③ To publicize wartime common sense, ④ To popularize mass education. Because they shoulder such an important mission, the authorities have provided them with in-depth training in personality cultivation and the spirit of service. It is expected that after they set off in the future, they will add a dynamic force to the people's economic construction. It is also heard that the first batch of group members is set at 30, the second batch at 60, and the third batch at 90, gradually increasing, starting from this city and spreading throughout the country. In such a long-term war of resistance, the most needed rear work is to enrich the national economic strength, and it is hoped that it can be gradually expanded. Not only will it help the country's future, but it can also help many unemployed young people who are wandering astray.</p>

<h3>Changshu Rice Guild Will Host Reporters Tonight</h3>
<p>Report on Changshu's Illegal Detention of Rice</p>
<p>After the Changshu County Government illegally received about 2,500 piculs of rice from rice merchants Shi Zufue and others, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the People's Food Regulation Committee, the Changshu Rice Guild, etc., telegraphed to request release, but it has not been complied with. Instead, the detained rice was confiscated and transferred to another owner. The Changshu Rice Guild will host news reporters from various newspapers at 6:00 tonight to report on the Changshu County Government's illegal detention of rice and request the support of public opinion to uphold justice.</p>
<h3>Zhu Baozhong Executed by Firing Squad</h3>

It has also organized various common sense lecture classes and training classes, which are very popular. All foreign firm Chinese staff who are determined to serve the country can register at the association. It is said that all expenses are not charged.</p>

<p>Wartime Youth Issue 13</p>
<h3>German Youth's Labor Service</h3>
<p>— Xu Wancheng</p>
<p>— Narrated by Dr. Wu Zhiqian, who recently returned from Italy and Germany —</p>
<p>The German authorities, in view of the failure of the World War, were not due to military affairs, but to food, so increasing agricultural products was seen as an urgent matter!</p>
<p>German people, workers account for more than 60%, farmers are actually in the minority. And reclaiming wasteland, opening rivers and building roads, all need people, so it is stipulated that high school graduates must serve for half a year before they can enter university or engage in social work. As for the scope of service, men open rivers, build roads, and cultivate land, while women help farmers manage children and plant vegetables. The implementation result is that everyone can do the job happily and the work efficiency is extremely high.</p>
<p>The German people's life is in "increasing revenue and reducing expenditure", mass production and restrained consumption. They are now preparing to store food using scientific methods to meet future needs. The general public is frugal. The whole country advocates filling their stomachs with potatoes (commonly known as yams), because potatoes grow very quickly, can be planted anywhere in the month, and are extremely rich in nutrients.</p>
<p>If the German people, who are persevering and ambitious, should be noticed by the world.</p>
