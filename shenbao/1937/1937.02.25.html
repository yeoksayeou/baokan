<h3>避名求實的對華外交</h3>
<p>[Z南雲&gt;</p>
<p>林內閣政綱的核心</p>
<p>㊀</p>
<p>恰好碰在一天開幕的，是中國南京的三中全會及停會三次後而又再開的日本第七十次議會。關於中國民簇的存亡問題，三中全會上已作了怎樣的決議，我們還未見到，這裏也不必論及。日本第七干次議會，雖然今天還在開會中，但各種重要的討論記載，都已見到了。毫無疑義的，一般的説來，第七十次議會的中心論題，祇是一個對華政策。</p>
<p>有人問：在此議會中，林首相兼外相宣佈的政網，且“國體明徵”，“國防充實及產業”，“求國民生活的安定”，“預算修一些及物價抑制”，與“一掃支那（中國）之誤解等，為甚麼能説對華政策是這一議會的中心問題？</p>
<p>我們可以答覆，不能包括在對會政策下的特殊事項是有的，例如議員中也有質問“人權蹂躪”的。但一般的説來，中心問題却是對華政策。</p>
<p>㊁</p>
<p>為甚麼，先就林首相的常説看，也就很夠明白了。——</p>
<p>“國體明徵的方針之一，卽是實現東亞之安定……”。不用説，這所謂“東亞”，是包括着中国講的。“保障東亞安定的領導勞力是日本”。今日的林首相，卽昔日的朝鮮軍司令官：“九·一八事變時，是這位林司令認為東三省不“安定”了，所以綫“獨斷”把“嘉村旅團”衝到東省去，此種“獨斷”，會贏得一個“越境將軍”的大名呢。今後的中國是否被林首相認為“安定”呢？這真是大問題，也是一目了然的大問題了。那麼，在實現東亞的安定”這一方針下，總不免隨時有戲劇徘演了。</p>
<p>所謂“國防充實”，表面上盾來，是和蘇聯及美國等競爭，實際上也是不用解釋便明白的問題了。説到振興產業”，除令日本勞動大衆忙煞外，擴大市場，奪取資源，便是最重要的活動。林首相將“國防”與“產業”並提，這不愧是陸軍大將而又是今日的首相兼外相了。但是，何處有最易取得的資源，何處是最近而且最大的市場？這也是濁用解答的了。</p>
<p>“求國民生活的安定”——這國民指怎樣的國民呢？勿論根據任何統計調查，現在的日本工農生浩，誰都得承認，比從前的任何時期都痛苦了（關於最近日本勞動者的生活及關爭，當另寫一文詳述）。佔日本國民最多數的是日本工農，然而，在林首相的政綱演説中，那裏有一點求工農生活安定的影子呢？</p>
<p>“預算修正及物價抑制”，便是“求國民生活安定”的政綱之一嗎？前內閣提出的預算案實在太大了（三十億四千萬元），現內閣提出“二億七千萬元的修正”，這能説是“求國民生活安定”的政綱嗎？並且所謂“修正”，並不是真的削除二億七千萬元，而是把這二億七千萬元，記入明年度的賬上（也就是記在國民負擔的帳上），到明年，仍得還出這筆帳來。還誰呢？還結軍療及內務省等。此種記賬式的預算修正，目的不過在減國一部份資本家的負担，稍稍和緩大衆的反抗情緒吧了。——質上，大衆負担是祇有越來越加重的。并且，在此修正賬上，對於陸海軍能夠暫時“拖欠”的，也祇不過四千六百萬元。</p>
<p>這樣的預算修正，如何能“安定國民生活”呢？若説以“抑制物價”求安定，“抑制物價”的有效辦法是甚麽？林內閣能強制減低資本家的利潤嗎？支持林內閣的是甚麽？開於日本物價飛騰的速度，據日本銀行調查，本年正月，東京物價指數，已上昇到一八一·三了（比去年十二月騰一四、六，比去年正月騰二二、八），但倫敦祇騰到一二二·三（比去年十二月騰二·六，比去年正月廳一四·六），紐約祇騰到一二九·○（比去年十二月騰二·○，比去年正月騰一三·九）。</p>
<p>物價這樣飛騰着，林內閣若不主張“抑制”，那當然要成為被攻擊的口實。不過，在輸出飩化，輸入以軍需品為主，和平也以軍需工業為骨幹的日本今日，要克服物慣騰貴，又如何可能呢？卽使拿出“物價統制強化”的法寶來，受犧牲的也祇不過是一部份盾本較弱的資本家，對於已經保持着獨佔價格的三井，三菱，是更有利益的了。結果，不安定的仍是大衆。</p>
<p>由以上的大要分析，可以縮寫為：在實現東亞安定（卽完成大陸政策）的方針下，擴張軍備，振興產業—便是林內閣的政網。換句話説，就是：在對華政策下，擴張軍備，振興產業。</p>
<h3>到百靈廟去（四）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者錢華</p>
<p>讓古草地百綜里無人烟　塞外冰雪前綫將土生活</p>
<p>㊄</p>
<p>冷坑凍得發跳</p>
<p>像這樣設備周到暖氣洋洋的特務機關長室，當然又是婦女們的優先權，我們的臨時宿舍乃在隔二條胡同的一個連部裏，很小的兩間十房子，三分之一的地位是磚坑，上面舖了一層薄薄的毡毯，屋子裏有一隻破鑽皮爐子，正燒着牛糞據兵土説：“百靈廟因為交通運輸的不方便，對於煤和食物最恐慌，尤其是煤炭，眞比黃金還要希奇。普通所用的燃料便是牛馬糞，我們弟兄每天出去總要順手檢一二蔴袋來，大家可以取暖，燒水煮飯更少不了他。這裏的午馬因為完全吃草的緣故，所以燒起來沒有什麽大味兒，蒙古人過冷天波有牛馬糞祇可活活凍死，可謂天造地設。牛馬糞雖然很容易燒，揮發力亦大，但是沒有持久性，要專有一個人繼續不斷的伺候着添火，否則邊了十分鐘，熊熊之火就掩旗息鼓而滅”。我們這時初經大寒，看見了火已經是親熱的了不得，祇覺得糞的味兒清香撲鼻，狠高興的同幾位伺候我們的土兵隨便談天，白天在車上勞頓一日，到了九點鐘已昏昏欲睡，但是望望磚坑上依然是一無所有，坑是冷坑，一股冷氣向上直冒，四壁潮潤又好像夏天進了山洞，觸手可怕。兵士又説：“我們弟兄祇有這一身衣服，晚上把老羊皮大衣充當大被，白天就穿著禦寒，諸位遠道來的貴客，也紙好將就一些了”。這時還有火，就很勇敢地回答他們説：“那不成問題，諸位能夠吃苦，難道我們有一二晚的功夫還不能忍受嗎？”於是記者也把皮大衣脫下，蓋在身上，拿小方鏡箱做枕頭，又把加登科也穿在脚上，和衣而臥。不久，兵士們去了，火也熄了，寒氣就一陣陣的侵襲進來，先從脚下冷起，逐步的冷到胸口，心都凍得發跳起來，全身抖索個不住，連忙把大衣皮　子緊緊裹住頭部，眞是轉側不能成寐。好容易熬到五更天，晨光熹微中大兵就跑了進來，趕快請他們生糞火，一夜難關，總算捱過。到第二天晚上，實在有些怕了，於是情商幾位弟兄們替我們輸流值夜，使糞火繼續維持到天明，勉强睡了幾個鐘頭。據説百靈廟的溫度清晨和晚上大約在零下四十度左右。近年可增高到零下二十度左右。在前年冬天，平地積雪四五尺，氣候冷到零下四十五度，牲畜人口凍死的甚多，以此例彼，我們的運氣已經算是不錯的了。</p>
<p>㊅</p>
<p>歡喜佛的刼運</p>
<p>百靈廟俗稱白靈廟，清康熙帝平定外蒙及新疆天山北路，曾駐兵於此，建喇嘛廟，所以最初稱為貝勒廟。其地周圍邱陵起伏，凡九座，儼如城郭，白靈河流貫其間。羣山環拱，南北有大口各一，都可通行車輛，東西山頭有小品共七，人九龍吐水的地形，俗稱九龍口，較長城的九門口更為險峻。記者窮一日之力，遊覽一週。從河西的許多喇嘛廟到河東市街，再㧞步登山，俯瞰全景，因為坡勢平緩，一口氣跑上去倒還不覺得十分吃力，山頂都有哨兵崗位，防禦工事異常嚴密，就百靈廟的國防前綫而言，眞是有特無恐了。百靈廟是總稱，這一圈地方大小喇嘛廟有十幾所，都是金壁輝煌，雄壯富麗。但是外面墻壁上纍纍彈孔，有的整塊的缺了一角，沙袋等防禦物依然堆在那邊，駐軍就在缺口所在擺上幾尊小鋼砲，好不威武，這些都是劇烈戰爭遺留下來的成續。廟裏面的雕刻繪畫都是十分精緻，全身金裝的佛像，更是莊嚴無比，雖然經過戰，各物都凌亂殘缺，但輪廓構造却沒有什麽變化。大殿四壁繪着奇怪神像，尤以牛大王下繪一女子作種種淫穢狀態為最不可思議。最後一殿都供着歡喜佛，多寡却不相等，欢喜佛是喇嘛廟最神聖不可侵犯的佛像，除蒙古王公貴族以外，都不許擅入此殿，就是十公貴族，也有一定的日子，方得進內參拜一番。北平的雍和宮也供奉着歡喜佛，皇帝大婚之夕，喇嘛領導到內殿，恭揭歡喜佛下部的紅圍布，請帝御目參觀。到了民國以後，遊雍和宮的化幾元法幣也得與皇帝享受同樣權利。百靈廟的歡喜佛特別來得多，有一個殿裏大大小小擺上十幾尊，可謂極歡喜佛的大觀，有種種不同的猥褻姿態，就形狀和意義上來説，對於新時代的女性確𨱪侮辱的能事，因為歡喜是雙方的，而塑像所表現的女性都是流血被面或恐怖號嘯的樣子，此無非顯示當年男性的無上權威，這個思想實在太落伍了。聽説國軍攻入白靈廟的時候，對於這樣神秘歡喜佛塑像都認為不合潮流，就一陣亂打，佛像頭斷臂折殘缺不全，完整的紙有十之一二，眞是歡喜沸的大刦數呀！（未完）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>經濟建設威功之蘄望</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>此次三中全會宣言。就經濟建設問題。多所發揮。略謂“國家統一之進行。必有持於經濟之統一。始為真正之成功。而當救亡圖存之會。國力之增長。尤有待於民力之充實。經濟建設。實為目前重要之圖。為思患預防計。則當從事於平均地權。節制資本。為增進生產計。則當從事於發達國家資本。而對於私人資本。同時加以適當之保護。……凡所舉措。務求適合於國防及人民生活之需要。尤必遵守民生主義之原則。務使社會利益。相互調和。平均發達。以馴致於共有共治共享之域。决不縱容階級鬥爭之謬説。以召致社會之擾亂。亦决不釀成貧富不均之屬階。以重貽將來之糾紛”。以上所言。誠為推本之論。循是以求。不數年後。經濟建設必有成效可覩矣。</p>
<p>年來經濟建設之聲浪。非不高也。然求其實際。往往無非紙上談兵。而所謂人才也者。非敢厚誣。實以“文章言説之土”為多。故“專家”不能説少。而事業之進步無幾。破壤不為不烈。而建設之工作有限。此民間所以屢有未享建設乏益先受建設之累者也以言工商實業基礎未立技能低劣遠不能望先進諸國之項背。然而剩餘之説。階級之見。早已深入於人心。洎乎糾紛之來。恒不龍為衡情酌理之處置。遂使有資力者不敢出共資。有勞力者莫由盡其力。非惟去興業之道愈遠。卽失業之恐慌亦愈深。目前工商業之疲敝不振原因雖多而此亦其一端也。</p>
<p>今後經濟建設之方針及其應取之舉措。三中全會旣已揭示於前。毋庸多贅。惟吾人所期望者。言其急。固應注重國防經濟之建設。尋其本。實非就全民利益着眼。切合人民生活之需要。從事於建設不可。故建設當猛晋。但亦切忌操切從事。眼光應遠大。但亦不可忘却現實環境。總之一切建設事業。均當斟酌於緩急大小之間以為興辦之先後。必如此。建設方能收“實事求是”之效也。</p>
<p>至工商業之復興。要當以改進其經營上組織上之知識技能為要圖。舊時之工商業缺乏此種精神與能力。致不能與外來之經濟勢力相抵抗。而“崇洋輕華”之積習。以及稅務行政之不能充分行使。亦為我工商業腹心之患。今內地手工業旣一敗塗地。僅有之少數輕工業。復脆弱異常。不堪外來勢力之一擊。農業生產技術。仍無改於數千百年前之陳法。收穫之豐歉。悉聽命於天。絕不思以人力圖免水旱蟲害等災。此無他。不知科學為何物。而未能應用科學於農業耳。今日之農工商業欲求進步策安全。勢非向“農業科學化”“工業農村化”二大目標盡其努力不可。此亦經濟建設之要旨也。</p>

<h3>宋子文等籌組糧食運銷公司</h3>
<p>資本總額暫定國幣一千萬元　定最近期內召開發起人會議　調劑國內米糧盈虛平衡價格</p>
<p>新新社云、關於調劑粵省米荒、組織糧食運銷公司事、新新社記者、特於昨午、往訪主持籌備之全國經濟委員會常委來子文氏、探詢眞相、</p>
<p>組煙起源</p>
<p>據悉、該公司組織之起源、由於宋子文氏去歲赴粵視察之後、當宋氏蒞粵之際、正粵省米糧恐慌之時、宋氏乃運用經濟眼光、注意全國米糧問題、以我國原為農產國家、近年來屢有糧食恐慌之現象、洋米進口乏數量、僅粵省而論、年進八百萬担至千厲担、代價約計八千萬元至一萬萬元、漏巵之鉅、殊堪驚人、然考諸國內所產米糧、如皖·湘·贛·各省產區之產額、因素無統計、缺乏程度、遂成為疑間、此種現象、若聽其自然、非唯攸關民食、抑且利害及於國民經濟、故自視察歸來、乃將粵省人士改進糧食之意見、並收集各方之主張、詳加研究後、决定籌組運銷公司、</p>
<p>三大要點</p>

<h3>統一興和平（續）</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>㊅</p>
<p>既然我們要盡全國上下的力做到眞正的統一，然後於必要時才能發動對外全盤的抗敵戰爭，那麽我們目前的問題就祇是如伺求得統一？以前我已説過，要得到統一，有時候須用戰爭的方法，有時候可用和平的方法。自民國二十年九一八以後，因為國難嚴重，强敵臨頭，中央政府在可能的範圍之内，總是用和平的方法来求統一。但是單單靠政府用和平的方法去求統一，是决不夠的，單讓中央請求軍閥餘孽，哀告他們不要割據，是與虎謀皮的，一定要有民衆的力量為後盾，才能用和平的方法取得統一。如果民衆不用力量帮助政府用和平的方法去求統一，則必不得已的時候恐將來還是要用着武力。然則民衆用什麼和平方法去帮助中央消滅割據势力完成统一呢？说到這一點，先要明白统一之梗是在於軍隊系统，故如果能够保全軍隊而同時化除系統，則割據勢力必於不動于戈之中消滅，而和平統一於焉實現。</p>
<p>什麽叫做保全軍隊而化除系統呢？璧如西安事變中張學良與楊虎城，僅僅是他們兩個人，决不能割據的，他們靠了軍隊的系統，才可以演割據的把戲。張學良以為東北軍是他的系統，楊虎城以為陝西軍是他的系統，所以才敢做此愚蠢的割據夢。甚至於共產黨的朱德毛澤東也以為“紅軍”是他們的系統，所以由江西老巢而流竄到陝甘邊境，還想始終割據。現在我們和平統一的方針，就不外乎保全軍隊，化除系統。如果軍隊中的士卒終不甘心終於叛變，不甘心，於為匪，翻然來歸，聽候中央指揮，則軍隊自然要保全的，否則消滅一萬就少一萬對外的力量。但是軍隊儘管保全，而其系統則絕對的耍化除，決不容許所謂東北軍，陝西軍……甚而至於共匪的所謂“紅軍”的系統依然存在。軍隊而有牢不可破的系統，完全是封建軍閥的思想，反統一的思想。我們現在祇應有中華民國的國軍，沒有省軍，祇應有國民革命軍，决没再有“紅軍”存在的許可。軍隊系統一化除，軍閥便無從割據了。</p>
<p>怎樣化除軍隊的系統呢？第一，地方政治應與軍人完全脫離關係。軍人不得干涉地方政治：所有軍事·外交·財政·民政等大權完全集中到中央，軍人不得把中央的治權來割裂。第二，軍隊應與駐在地脫離關係。凡是國家的軍隊，中央隨時可以調防。在一個近代國家裏，從來沒有聽説過，某人的軍隊一定要馱在某地，想調動他一動，就要反抗。而中國軍隊的一部份竟然如此，這還能算是國家的軍隊嗎？所以要做到軍隊與駐在地方不發生固定運繋，隨時可以調動，這樣才可以抗敵、而才是尊重是央，忠於國家的軍隊。第三，軍隊應與統率的將領不發生絕對關係。今天某師派某甲任師長，則某師的煎任師長乙應該將印信交出來，這樣的軍隊才是國家的軍隊，而不再是師長個人的軍隊。這三點完全做到了，割據的勢力才算用和平的方法加以消滅。不過要做到這三點，一定需要用到民衆的犬力。（未完）</p>

<h3>韓信</h3>
<p>— 鹿鳴高</p>
<p>—自立是立身之本—</p>
<p>『媽媽，信叔韰好幾天没來了……』孩子雙手捧着飯碗，側着頭望着他的媽媽説。</p>
<p>『才一天没有來，虧你這樣想他！』媽媽很不高興的説，跟着夾一塊肉放在孩子的碗上，『來罷，他狼吞虎咽，吃得又多，又愛檢好的吃，他來，還會有肉掉入你的小嘴裏？』</p>
<p>小孩聽了媽媽的話，雖然不做聲，但他很不以爲然。他記得信叔叔每回來吃飯，吃得並不比他多，同時有好的總是讓給他吃。他不懂媽媽爲什麽這樣討論厭信叔叔。</p>
<p>吃過飯，媽媽在廳上織布，孩子在院子裏放風箏。綫短風箏小，總是放不上，小孩正在着急，有人打門，他也懶得去開。</p>
<p>『龍兒，怎麽啦？你還不去開門！説不定爸爸帶着大風箏回來呢。』</p>
<p>龍兒聽了媽媽的話，忙跳着開門去。原來不是别人，是信叔叔。</p>
<p>韓信今天有些異樣了！他頭上戴一頂新帽，腰裏佩一把新劍，昂然的走進來。臉色紅紅，顯然是喝過許多酒的。龍兒扛着韓信的劍，擁着他到廳上來，一面走一面説道：</p>
<p>『信叔叔，那裏來這一把劍？很像是我爸爸的——您吃過飯没有？我們今日吃熟羊頭。』</p>
<p>信笑笑地不做聲，走上前對在機上織布的婦人作揖道：</p>
<p>『黄大嫂，黄大哥叫我通知您，今天亭上有事，他没空回來了。』</p>
<p>黄大嫂也不下機來，只停了手，扭着身子打量信一下，然後半恭維半譏笑的説道：</p>
<p>『韓大郎，恭喜您，敢是做了官罷？高高的帽兒，長長的劍兒，並且都是新的，多威風呀！』</p>
<p>信怪不好意思，説不出話來。龍兒看見既不是爸爸帶大風箏回來，大人説的話他不感覺趣味，悄悄地便又溜到院子裏去了。過了一會，信才紅紫着臉説道：</p>
<p>『還不是黄大哥弄的把戲嗎。今天早上他到館裏來找我説：「信弟，我善没有什麽得罪你，你爲什麽負氣跑出來？」我道：「我那裏敢負氣？只因爲我靠老兄吃飯日久，竟毫無長進報答深思；一時抱愧，所以無顔再留。我現在已經是一個足足滿二十歳的青年了，又不是小孩，怎好還依賴人不求自立呢？」不想大哥一聽我説出二十歳，便硬扯着我出來道：「信弟，過去的不必再説，從今日起，你還是回到我家裏，我把你當親弟弟一般看待。難得弟你今年是廿歳，二十而冠，是人生的大禮，恰好今日是一個好日子，讓爲兄的替你行冠禮罷。」大哥不由我分説，便買一頂新帽給我帶着，請幾個朋友在酒館裏喝了幾杯慶祝酒。臨走時，大哥又説我的劍太短太舊，不好看，又硬把他的換給我。』</p>
<p>『原來如此，你倒佔了你大哥的大便宜了。』黄大嫂馬上翻起臉來，『不過這把劍是我積錢買給他的，請你還給我，你自己另買一把罷！你離了我們幾天，説筫定你有很大的造化，那裏在乎這一點錢。』</p>
<p>她一面廹着信解劍，一面直着嗓子向外喊道：</p>
<p>『龍兒，開門給信叔叔出去買劍，他還答應買一個大風箏給你呢。』</p>
<p>信無可奈何地舉着重重的脚歩走了。筫懂事的龍兒，還在後頭做着手勢，大聲叮囑着：</p>
<p>『信叔叔，風箏至少要買這樣大，小的放不起來。最好綫也給我買一綑來。』</p>
<p>他望着韓信去遠了，才把門關上，心裏想道：『只要有大風箏。綫不買也成，我可以偷媽媽織布的紗紡綫來放。』他忽然又記着昨天因爲偷綫紗給母親發覺打破大腿皮的事，不覺伸手摸着傷痕滴出淚來。轉想道：『還是信叔叔連綫也買來好』。</p>
<p>晚飯前，信回來了。腰裏佩一把新買來的劍，兩手空空，既没有風箏，也没有綫。龍兒曉得他自己受騙了，哭着要風箏，不肯吃飯。也挔黄大嫂激起脾氣來，又痛打龍兒一頓。她鞭子打兒子，咀裏駡韓信：</p>
<p>『你少説，在我們家裏也已經白吃了兩三年罷？買一個風箏給孩子也不能説是報恩，誰知道「一斗米養一個恩人，一石米養一個仇人」呢？有錢買劍，没錢買風箏？』她忽然放下手不打孩子，轉了口氣道：『不出息的孩子，你錯認好人了！你想風箏！該問爸爸要，怎好……』</p>
<p>她還没説完，忽然有一個人推開大門，走進來了，是一個鑄劍的學徒。他看見黄大嫂這時的咀臉，心裏很害怕，慌慌張張的説道：</p>
<p>『請您恕我唐突！我敲門敲了半天，不見人來開門。原來門是虚掩着的，輕輕一推便推開了。』</p>
<p>『你説什麽呀？道二不着兩。乾脆告訴我，你來幹什麽？』</p>
<p>這學徒給她一廹，更不知怎樣説才好，喘了幾次氣，才望望坐立不安的韓信説道：</p>
<p>『我找韓大郎説話！』</p>
<p>『什麽鬼鬼祟祟的事情？你要在這裏説個明白。』她起身攔着廳門口，怕來人走了。</p>
<p>『今天師父不在家，我做主賒了一把劍給韓大郎。剛才師父回來，説韓大郎是一個窮措人，不會有錢買劍的，要我馬上趕來把劍追回去。』</p>
<p>韓信站着一旁，臉色忽然青忽然紫，狼狽極了！他没法替自己解説，只得悄悄地把劍解下來，讓學徒背回去。他不好意思再呆下來，托辭有事，連晚飯也不吃便走了，到了吃早飯時，又厚着臉皮到黄家來。不想一直等到中午還不見開飯，他很奇怪。他使一個眼色叫龍兒出來，暗裏問他道：</p>
<p>『今天韓嗎這樣晚還不吃飯呢？你們不餓嗎？』</p>
<p>『信叔叔，讓我告訴您罷，可是您别讓媽媽知道是我學舌的。』</p>
<p>『當然，你快説罷！』韓信急於要知道是什麽一回事。</p>
<p>『今天很早媽媽便把我叫醒了，她説，「龍兒，快起來吃飯，信叔叔快來了。」我還以爲我睡過了鐘頭，已經是吃早飯的時候了。我才梳洗完，很奇怪媽媽把飯開來床上吃。我説：「床太小，信叔叔來，怎够坐呢？」媽媽笑道：「你還好不懂事的孩子，這裏豈是請信叔叔吃飯的地方？我們把飯挪在這裏，意思就是不想有信叔叔的分。等一會他來，你不要告訴他，説我們吃過了。讓他餓一個臭死，以後才不敢再上門來。」我怕媽媽，不敢替您説話。一吃飽，就跑出來玩了。』</p>
<p>韓信聽見龍兒的話，知道黄大嫂有心絶他，很生氣，忍着飢餓，也不告辭黄亭長，便離開這裏去了。黄大嫂還在丈夫那裏説韓信許多壞話，使黄亭長也恨也韓信，不再找他回來。</p>
<p>韓信没法謀生，到城下釣魚去。有一天，有許多婦人在池裏漂棉，她們看見韓信饑到幾乎連釣竿也舉不起，都嘲笑他没用。只有一個年老的漂母可憐他，送飯給他吃。她漂幾十天的棉，便供養韓信幾十天。末了，韓信很感激的對漂母説道：</p>
<p>『我將來一定要重重的報答您。』</p>
<p>『大丈夫不能自食，是天下最羞恥的事。我可憐您才給您吃，那裏望您報答我呢？您努力求自立罷，乞食倚人不是大丈夫的行徑。』漂母辭嚴氣正的責備信，不由他不覺悟了。從此他努力做人，勤學向善，不久便成爲一個積學之士。但當時的人都不懂得他。有一天，他在淮陰市上過，有一班無賴少年要侮辱他。爲頭的一個説：『你雖然又高又大，喜歡帶刀佩劍，其實你心裏是很害怕的。』他把兩腿展開，做一個騎馬的姿勢，然後拍着胸脯對信説道：『你如果是一個勇敢的人，請你拔刀來刺死我，否則你要從我的胯下爬出來。』</p>
<p>韓信知道自己前途遠大，不肯爲無謂的爭執犧牲。他熟視了那人一會兒，便彎着腰低下頭，從那人的袴下爬出來。市中的人都笑，説韓信怯懦不中用。</p>
<p>不久，秦亡，天下大亂，羣雄紛紛起來。楚將項梁渡淮，韓信仗劍跟從他。梁不曉得信是賢人，不知道重用他。梁死，信又跟梁的姪子羽，羽用他做郎中。信屢次替羽畫策，羽不用。後來漢高祖入蜀，信便從楚逃歸漢。但還是做一個小小的官，誰也不知道他。有一天，一羣人犯罪該斬，不幸信也在內。當他們解到法塲時，信以爲必死，閉着眼睛，等刀下來，一刀一個，殺了十三人。輪到信，信不覺仰頭看看，看見監斬的是滕公。信一時情急智生，問道：「漢王不想取天下嗎？爲什麽要斬壯士？」</p>
<p>滕公看見信相貌英偉，又會説這樣豪語，敬了他不斬。滕公和信談話，知道他是非常人，很喜歡他，荐他給高祖。高祖用了他做治粟都尉，但並不怎樣賞識他。</p>
<p>信和丞相蕭何談了好幾次，何非常佩服他。那時項羽勢雄，高祖力弱。有些將官不相信高祖會有成就的，來到南鄭，半道逃走了幾十人。信看見許多人走，不覺自己也有感觸道：</p>
<p>「何他們一定已經在漢王面前介紹我許多次了。今日他還不用我，將來可知，不如我也走罷。」</p>
<p>信逃走的消息傳到何那裏，何來不及禀報高祖，忙親自跑去追信。高祖不知道實情，聽見何走，很生氣，像失了左右手一樣。過了兩天，何回來謁見高祖。高祖又生氣又歡喜的駡何道：</p>
<p>「韓嗎你也逃走？」</p>
<p>「臣不敢逃走，臣是去追一個逃走的人。」</p>
<p>「你追誰呀？」</p>
<p>「追韓信。」</p>
<p>「請將逃走的，不下十多人，你都不追。今兒你追信，是假的。」高祖很不客氣的駡。</p>
<p>「諸將容易得，要去便去，何必追呢？至於信，是國士，天下無雙。」何也很不客氣的回高祖，「王只想永遠做漢中王，當然用不着信；如果一定想爭天下，就非信不可。但不知道王打算怎呢？」</p>
<p>「我打算東向爭天下，我怎能鬱鬱久住在這裏呢？」</p>
<p>「王原來一定往東的。那末，信用得着了，能用信，信即留，不能用，他終歸要走的。」</p>
<p>「那末，因爲你的緣故，我用他做將。」高祖還有些勉强。</p>
<p>「雖爲將，信一定也不肯留的。」</p>
<p>「用他做大將罷？」</p>
<p>「這樣，好極了！」何很高興的答道。</p>
<p>於是高祖要召信來拜爲大將，何道：「王素來待人傲慢無禮。今兒拜大將，也像呌小孩子一樣的呌他來，所以信要走呢。王如果一定要拜他，請擇一個好日子，齋戒，設壇塲，按着隆重的禮儀，鄭重的舉行才可以。」</p>
<p>高祖全聽了何的話。軍裏大規模的籌備，誰也知道高祖要拜大將，但不知道他拜誰。於是諸將都很歡喜，人人各自以爲有做大將的希望。不想等到拜大將時，竟然是拜韓信。全軍都驚奇，以爲高祖瘋了。</p>
<p>禮行完了，信坐着上位，漢王很恭敬的請教道：「丞相常常説將軍是奇才，不曉得將軍有什麽教導寡人呢？」</p>
<p>信　很謙遜的道謝，然後問高祖道：「今兒東向與之爭天下，是不是項王？」</p>
<p>「是。」</p>
<p>「請大王自己，估計一下，您的勇悍仁强，比項王怎樣？」</p>
<p>高祖默默想了許久，才道：「比不上！」</p>
<p>信忙起座，再拜道賀道：「信也以爲大王比不上呢。不過他並不可怕。臣也曾服事過他，很知道他的爲人，請爲王説説：項王暗噁叱咜，千人皆廢，但不能任用賢將，這不過是匹夫之勇罷了。項王看見人，恭敬慈愛，和顔温語；人有疾病，他流着眼淚送人飲食；但人有功應封爵，印刻好擱到破了，他還捨不得給人，此所謂婦人之仁呢。項王雖覇天下而臣諸侯，不居關中而都影城，有背義帝之約；把他自己親愛的人封諸侯，不公平。諸侯看見項王遷逐義帝，都學效他，回頭各逐其主，割據善地，項王所過，没有不殘滅的。天下多怨，百姓不親附。暫時服從他的人，不過被他的威力劫持罷了。他名雖爲覇，實在失天下心。所以我説，他的强是很容易變弱的。如果大王真能反項王所爲，用天下武勇之士，何所不誅？以天下城邑封功臣，何所不服；以義兵跟從渴望東歸之士，何所不克。並且三秦王本來是秦將，竟叛降楚，讓項王詐坑秦降卒二十多萬，而只有他們三個漢奸安然得脱。今兒他們賴項王的扶助，居然都做了秦王。秦父兄怨這三個人，痛入骨髓，誰也不愛戴他們。至於大王之入武關，秋毫無犯，除秦苛法，只和秦民約法三章。秦民没有不願得大王做秦王的。何况依照諸侯之約，大王是應王關中的，關中人民都知道。今兒大王被廹放棄關中，秦民没有不引以爲恨的。情勢如此，如果大王舉兵東向，三秦馬上可以傳檄而定。」</p>
<p>高祖聽了信的話，非常的歡喜，大有相見恨晚之慨。於是他聽了信的話，果然毫不費力便取得三秦。以後高祖言聽計從，終竟靠信的智能統一全中國。</p>
<p>據説韓信功成名顯後，找漂母報恩找不着，痛哭流涕投千金於漂池裏去，以爲紀念。</p>
<h3>吕呵芬克（續）（1632-1723）</h3>
<p>— 伍必雄</p>
<p>—第一位知道有微生物的人—</p>
<p>拔爾巴阿（Balboa）是多麽地得意，當他是全歐洲第一個發現了太平洋！不過這海洋對於中美的印第安人熟悉得像地中海對於拔爾巴阿一樣。吕芬呵克的發現微生物，可不是這樣的情形！他經歷的境地，是全世界任何人未曾經歷過的；他發現的新奇，是一個肉眼不能見的生物世界。它們從太古起相互生活着，鬬爭着，它們和人類一樣有繁榮和死亡，可是没有人對它們曾有所了解。它們雖然要比人小上幾千萬萬倍，而其中有些利害得可以滅絶人類。毒蛇猛獸也没有這些陰險的惡魔來得可怕：它們不肯饒恕摇籃中含着甜笑的嬰孩，不會放過警衛森嚴中不可一世的帝王。在這癲狂的看門人之前，世界各地還没一個人有過一瞬的時間在這奇境中逗留過。</p>
<p>他繼續不斷地觀察雨水，先後發現了各種不同的微生物。</p>
<p>不過有個問題難住這位深考不倦的研究家了。雨滴中那些小汚難以使人相信的小東西是打那兒來的？它們打天下落下來的嗎？從地面上爬到水裏去的呢？還是上帝創造的呢？</p>
<p>吕芬呵克是虔信上帝的，而他健全的理智又告訴他「生物來自生物」。他認爲去想什麽天下掉下蟲來的事，是太無意思了！怎樣才能解這謎呢？且住，有一個辦法：「實騐」。</p>
<p>天正在下雨。吕芬呵克拿了一隻酒杯，怎仔細地把它洗乾净，凑在屋簷下水槽出口處，用他細如毛髮的玻管吸了一小滴雨水，急忙跑到他的透鏡那兒去，看啊！雨水中仍有着小生物，它們游來游去。他起初以爲新鮮的雨水中也有微生物，可是再一想，覺得這算不得證明，它們或許在水槽中生存着，而被雨水冲洗出來的。</p>
<p>他拿了一隻大磁盆，洗乾净後，冒着雨把它放在一隻高大的箱子上，使地上的汚物不致濺到裏面去。他把第一次盛滿的雨水潑掉，使盆子更乾净些。於是用管尖恨謹愼地取了一小滴雨水，跑到研究室裏去觀察。</p>
<p>「我已證實了！這水中并無一個生物。所以這些微生物并不是天上掉下來的」。</p>
<p>這荷蘭人曾否馬上寫信給皇家學會，把他的發現向全世界大吹大擂嗎？不，他是不肯貿然從事的。他把河水，溝水，井水拿來觀察，發見裏面都有着微生物。他到這時才有把握。</p>
<p>現在他寫了封很長的信給皇家學會告訴他們他最近的發現。那些博學的會員們中有些很懷疑他。什麽！這荷蘭人要叫他們相信世界上竟有這種小生物，一小滴的水中所有的多於他國中的全人口！胡説八道！乾牛酪中的蛆才是上帝所創最小的生物。虧得其中有幾位把吕氏的報告看得恨愼重，於是請他詳細解釋。</p>
<p>吕芬呵克把他研究的經過詳詳細細地報告了皇家學會。皇家學會也根據了報告做了一次同樣的實騐，結果發現吕氏並没撒謊，他的發現確是科學上的一大發現因此就請他做會員。</p>
<p>這位像小狗般到處搜索的科學家，後來又想到他牙齒上白色穢物，這究竟是什麽呢？他從牙齒上刮下些來，用純净的雨水把它調稀，用細玻管吸了一點。放在他的顯微鏡下觀察。……</p>
<p>啊！裏面有着許多不同的小生物：它們表現着各種滑稽的動作。人們發現了各人嘴裏都有着一個動物園，這那裏想得到的呢！如不把它們驅逐出境，它們就會把牙齒弄壞。他從幾位不刷牙的朋友中，證實了他的理論。</p>
<p>他雖在斜學上已有獨到的建樹，而仍發奮前進。他在長時期敏鋭的觀察中所發現的不斷地引起科學家們的驚奇。他在一條小魚尾中發現了血水球，發現毛細管，看見那些血小球經毛細管由動脈流入静脈，無意中證實了哈維氏的理論。對於他什麽都看的顯微鏡，是無所謂神秘，無所謂骯髒，無所謂低賤。假使他不是個實事求是的人，把各種有趣的東西，牽入他研究的範圍，我們一定會覺得那鐵面無情的科學更會呌人頭痛，那玄妙莫測的微生物。一定更難使人注意，更難使人相信。</p>
<p>吕芬呵克的聲名日噪，他對那神奇世界的秘密仍繼續發掘種種光榮並没使他那謙虚的研究態度有絲毫的變更。這是什麽緣故？因爲他早就有一個「搜求真理」的高尚意志。</p>
<p>吕氏是個非常健康的老者，他喜歡喝酒，在喝得泥醉時，就用十分燙的咖啡來解酒，在研究微生物的過程中，往往從那些日常生活中發現了新鮮的研究材料。一天，他又喝醉了，當然又喝了許多很燙的咖啡，他偶然想到再去觀察一下他先前發現的嘴裏動物園：他從門齒剔下些牙汚來觀察，只見裏面滿是小生物的屍體不再看見它們的活動，祗有一二個還有氣無力地蠕動着，像害着重病。原來燙的咖啡經過門牙已把上面的微生物殺死。他再觀察臼齒間的穢物，却像和以前一樣，仍有許多生龍活虎的微生物在裏面活動着。他滲了些水進去。放在火上燒得很熱，微生物的一切運動隨着温度的上升，起先動作呆滯，最後停止了，它們没法再生存下去。因此他更確定，殺死他門牙上的微生物就是咖啡的熱度。加熱而能將微生物殺死的事實，告訴了現代一種很有效的消毒方法。</p>
<p>吕氏已過了八十歳，雖然還健，可是牙齒却開始動摇；他對於老境上不可避免的現象並不抱怨他倒拔下幾隻壞牙齒，把透鏡對向那蛀空的牙根而研究。朋友勸他放棄研究的工作而該休養老年了。這老者皺起眉頭，目光灼灼地回答他的朋友説：</p>
<p>「在秋天成熟的果實最能耐久！」八十五歳的高齡，在他才是生命的秋天！</p>

<h3>「服務與修養」</h3>
<p>— 李涵田</p>
<p>趙宗預編著　商務出版</p>
<p>人生有兩大工作；就是修養與服務。這兩大工作，也可説是人類生活之進程上所最爲重要的。一個人，誰都希望切切實實，對着現實世界，修養一個健全的人；同時人因爲受了社會的供給，生存於社會之中，在道德和義務上都應替社會服務的。要而言之，因爲人没法離開社會，而社會上又不單是一個人，所以不能不講求如何適應社會，如何獲利於社會，這就是修養，修養之目的也就在於服務，在增修服務的工具。</p>
<p>修養與服務的對象，都是社會，不是爲自己，爲的是社會，就是最確切的解釋。修養與服務不能單獨分開，而互相以著其成效。根據這個觀點而下實際的指示以求進修這便是「服務與修養」一書精神之所在。</p>
<p>「服務與修養」是趙宗預先生爲一般在職業界工作的青年而作，全書二十萬言，分上中下三卷，先後在職業補習學校等處教過。第一言德性修養，教人如何做人，如何修養志氣，如何達到快樂生活，一動一静間的方法，自己的覺悟和自知短長，由自動能力求達到雙手萬能，更由奮勉節儉儲蓄以始終不變，打破難關，與逆境掙扎，而至順境之應付；再由此用克己功夫，講求對人方法，應以忠恕相親相愛同情心等等之基本道德。</p>
<p>至於服務上之道德修養，首當注意個人之工作與品性，因此更能養成其研究精神，運用科學的方法，創造的本能，更由奮鬥犧牲以求合作，有法治的精神，有對於信仰職業的精神，尤其在成敗的歧途上，極須注意時間，思想，生活，困難，批評，機會，意志，德性各方面的探求，而不至流於青年的迷津之中。</p>
<p>第二是講求如何求知能及體格修養。一個對於求知的目的和途徑，應該認識淸楚，同時要求求知的態度與習慣，更應决定求知的計畫，求時間精神的經濟，所以對於科目的抉擇，科目之形式效用的分類及選科之標凖，同時對於書籍的選擇，如何去探究而學習之，如何去理解它，如何去記憶它，如何去做筆記，這些都是極重要的工作。但是求知要有工具，其第一工具爲「看」「讀」「寫」「作」，第二工具爲通習外國文字，對於外國文之選擇讀法文法寫作會話等；第三工具爲常識的來源，力求豐富，其方法應多參觀旅行訪問談話聽講多做事等。</p>
<p>對於能的修養，如計算上之心算筆算；辦事上之對事對物對人之不同方法；説話上的技能及表情之笑的技能；感覺和手足的技能等等。修養與服務都有連繫的關係。（未完）</p>

<h3>怎樣準備，準備什麼？</h3>
<p>— 天羽</p>
<p>二十一日的本報星期論壇，葉公超先生在所作“抗戰的前幕二文中説：“我們將來非戰不能收復一寸失地，非戰不能拯救三千萬水深火熱中的同胞。”這不是葉先生一個人的話，而是全國民衆都要説的話，都認識這一句話是千萬真確的“真理”。現在的重要間題，是怎樣“戰呢”？即戰？慢戰？有準備的戰呢？還是民族危機，已迫眉睫，不容再有長時期考慮而非立戰不可？若是準備的話，要準備些什麽，要怎樣準備？葉先生的答案是：“既然認定了我們的出路，我們就要想，從現在到正面衝突的那一天，我們要怎樣才能生存着；不但生存着，同時還要準備，建設。”我們就來接談些關於怎樣準備要準備些什麼的問題罷。</p>
<p>現代的軍事家政治家，都一致的指出：“現代的戰爭是國力的戰爭”。這里所指的“國力”，通常只把一國的軍隊人數，軍備的程度，以及更重要的作戰資源，如鑛產，糧食以至於運輸等等，包括於內。而他們却都恰恰忘記了一種可以决定戰爭最后勝負的最大“國力”，這便是“全民衆的力量”！在蔑視民衆力量，懷疑民衆力量者看來，這里説全民衆力量是决定戰争最後勝負更大的國力，也许被認為一種笑話，但如不忘記歷史許許多多偉大的變動，都以廣大民衆力量來完成的，如北伐成功，卽共一例，這事實是不可抹煞的。因之，我們以為，在敵人高度的工業技術與我國落後的工業水準相差甚遠的情形之下，説到準備，若只從軍備與作戰資源上去努力，這是最難見效的方法。情形很明白，我們走一里，他們走十里百里，這真類於古説：“夸父追日”的故事了。故我們以為。今日不言準備則已，若言之，則唯有從速組織民衆，訓練民衆，最重要的是蓄養民衆抗敵的决心！自然，不是説軍事準備不需要，却尚在其次，至少軍事準備與培養民衆抗敵力量要放在同等並重的基礎之上。</p>
<p>而我們試回意過去一二八的戰爭，長城喜峯口之戰，以至於最近綏遠的抗戰，笨一次真正抗戰發動時，民衆的力量，就跟着抗戰的激急而猛烈的發揮出來。這都是事實。我們可説，潛蘊於全國內的民衆抗敵力量，是無窮盡的，而受了幾年許多奇奇怪怪，悲慘淋漓事實的教訓，這力量珔一天一天在增厚發展。現在只剩一個問題：怎樣去利用這力量，作為對外最有力的武器。因之，我們認為要準備的，就該吸收民衆力量，為政府對外最有力的後盾，而這，却需要把潛在的力量，提出於社會表面，成為一種運動，才可達到這目的的。我們認為現在應準備的，最重要是這一點。</p>
<p>葉先生根沉痛的説：“但是沒有計劃的忍痛只是奴才的本領。”我們深望每個民衆都能被組織到最前綫去作抗敵的“戰士”而不要讓人人準備為異日的“奴才”這樣才好。</p>
<h3>正月裏</h3>
<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>大年初一早晨，鄕間滿處充溢喜悅的抽象。男男女女，老老少少，沒一個不是喜氣滿面，街上漂泛着美麗的太陽光，成羣成行的人來往着，簇新的服裝，顯然的是一種新的現名開如成長。不管往日有仇有恨，這到皃见面总得作揖間好，就是昨天還逼死逼活要債的，現在他得互相笑嘻嘻的道聲：“過年發財”—在瓦房中，草屋裏，每個人家都有人來“拜年”。村中是不分什麼“姓”和“族”的，一律要互相“拜年”，從不知年代的祖先遺留下之風俗，誰不能更改，新年中這村子里是和氣而且親熱的，人與人之間的嫉忌，仇銀，厭惡，消逝得一乾二凈。</p>
<p>小孩子成羣結隊的在街上摜爆竹，“打窩兒”，（一種兒童賭戲）“趕趟兒”）能跑從追的一種遊嬉），半壯男子大半都在家廟前的平地上踢毽子，打“響器”（卽鑼鼓）。可是女人却很少見，除掉小女孩，大人是不能隨便跑上街的，古規矩女人不過三不準上街，不過初六不能往別人家裹去，這空當里婦女都蹩在家裏吃喝睡覺。</p>
<p>打初一到十五，這半月中吵架的事情是絕不會發生的。年中是吉慶的日子，要是吵了架就得倒一年霉！自然也有些喜歡喝酒的人，醉後任人説罵，有時吵得人家的宴席不能順利的進行。但這也不能引起對方的氣忿，誰都相讓，忍耐，躱避與人衝突。</p>
<p>初三過了，男子開始“走親戚”。山道上，官道上，大大小小的路上，幾乎全有提着紅綠包袱，或拐着元斗簍子”（一種柳條編的帶梁的籃子）的人，來來往住。女人也由這天起解放了一道束縛，她們梳洗打扮得乾乾凈凈，花花梢梢，三三五五的往祠堂里去看“祭饌”供品。她們批評着那樣“祭饌”做得美觀，那樣頂不濟！日子總是像河水一般流過去，初六轉眼來了。這時候“走親戚停止了，男子漢都忙着弄“鬧元宵”的玩藝兒。</p>
<p>特別是娘兒們成天仔盼着“元宵佳节”。到那時候官“高蹺會”唱秧歌，有鞦韆打，有“黃河”串，自己儘可能的修飾得漂漂亮亮，誰不盼呢？連白髪的老太婆都急着聽秧歌”。初十以前母親慫恿兒子媳婦懇求丈夫，呌他們出頭辦“耍會”。於是年輕的都出動了。第一件事是吊鞦韆，在村中挑三四處寬敞的地方，埋了大木椿，然後沿門挨戶收稻草，把許多稻草展成大粗綆，這才把鞦韆吊好。一天的工夫他們很從容的便把“輪子鞦韆，”掛鞦韆”，“龍門鞦韆”吊起。婦女們都給鞦韆吸引住了，她們成天到晚打不够，因為是年下，男人不會跟她吵罵，所以可以任性自由一點。</p>
<p>接着那些辦秧歌耍會”的小伙子们就忙起來啦！白天在麥場上練高蹺，夜里聚在空屋子里排習秧歌，敲着鑼鼓，一板一句都練得滾滾爛熟。等到“秧歌”和“高跷”都熟熟練练，他们便暂时停止，又忙亂着紥“黄河，照規短十四日就得把“黃河”紥好，十五日人們好來串。所謂“黃河”，是由神話和傳説得來的。水災，災民便往外省外縣逃荒，故鄉雖然離黃河很遠，可是有時也怕“逃茺的”過來騷擾，所以就在平地上紥起“黃河”，人們在里邊串了就可免災難。“黃河”的紥法是在一塊廣闊平坦的地面上，埋起七百二十棵木椿，再用手指粗細的草繩在木椿上聯成灣灣轉的空當，在“邊的中央留兩口“進口”“入口”。串的人從入口進去，串遍每個空當才能從從“出口”出來。祇要“進入口”就不能退回，或是半途折回，串不完據説非招水災不可，總之鄕下人造出好多口實來保護迷信。</p>
<p>“元宵”在鄕村中是個狂歡之夜。人們發了狂，愉快得無以復加。高蹺會都打扮得花花綠綠，在“黃河”里串，同時旗傘招展，燈火輝煌，每顆木椿上的燈光宛如星星。“黃河”門口的大彩坊上，懸着一行“走马燈”。钟鼓喧天，鞭砲接連不斷的響着，超花（一種砲類在）空中奔馳。村子歡騰着，“黃河”成了“極樂世界”。</p>
<p>串完“黃河”，高蹺休息。這時有人站兩層桌子上，放燄火。最後觀衆圍成一個大圈子，高蹺會唱秧歌，直鬧到天傍亮才散回去。</p>
<p>過了“元宵節”，第一天就有外村的“秧歌會來”唱秧歌，一連三天都有秧歌靜，鄕村又寂寞起來。</p>
<h3>街景</h3>
<h3>詩人與現實</h3>
<p>— 克</p>
<p>下了一天的雪，到晚來越發大了，馬路上的車馬已絕了跡，偶然祇有一二個行人把頭縮在衣領中低着頭忽忽地過去，屋頂和馬路同樣，讓白雪把高低不平的地方鋪平了，失去了本來的面耳。</p>
<p>有着詩人氣質的苓，動識另外去開一個有北方情調的放館去住，他説，住在上海式的旅館裏，的是水汀等設備，看到的雪景是馬路，那太不夠味了。我們正愁這麼一個小房間睡不下許多人，當然附議了他的主張，於是，不管雪下得多大，把大衣領拉起了，把脚印留給雪地，談笑着去找有北方情調的旅館去。</p>
<p>走了沒有多遠，我們找到了一家，那家旅館有着個大院落，房門便是衝着院子开的，院子裏有着些花木，也有個小小的池沼，雪把它們一打扮，就格外好看了，走廊上有一些被風吹進来的殘子裏的小樹下應該有匹手騾。再應該有個綠棉褲紅棉襖的當爐女來招持我們的時候，當差的已把我們領到一個房間裏了。</p>
<p>那間房間有個棉門帘，顏色是灰暗的，已分不出本來是怎樣的顏色，房中央有個小火爐，但是熄着，一切的陳設是都簡陋的，但在當時我們却認為古樸有趣，所以並沒有説什麽便住下了，祇關照當差的趕緊來生爐火。</p>
<p>火爐生起來了，把皮鞋拖了换上拖鞋，把火僵凍的脚攔在火炉旁，把當中的燈熄了，祇讓那盞小柜燈吐出淡淡的光，捧一杯熱茶在手裏，我們眞感到有點古趣盎然”。尤其是圍爐而坐的我們三個都是平常談得上的朋人，在年齡上雖已到了青年，而實質上却每個都是大孩子，每個人都有一個光明而純潔的夢，然而這些夢上面却都蒙上了灰塵和油污。</p>
<p>這樣的場合是會很快的使人連想起“聯齋誌異”或“秋燈夜雨綠”起來的，這旅館又大陳舊，門外括着風，電燈的開關又太鬆，又裝在門外，被風一吹，那正中本來熄着的電燈便一閃的亮了起來，年齡最大孩子氣却最重的苓第一個呌起來説：</p>
<p>“狐仙來了。”</p>
<p>明望望房門，來一個驚喜交集的表情，説：</p>
<p>“文，你所念念不忘的緣棉褲紅棉襖的姑娘來了。”</p>
<p>這樣的場合本來是宜於論狐説鬼的，但我們不知怎樣的却把它扯到別方面去了，苓在構思一個新劇本，他想把他和他的交親的表面歡洽，心裏衝突寫成一個悲喜劇：明説他到現在還沒有愛人，需要一個愛人，我却又懷念起久遠而至今還不曾實現的夢：我要一個歷經滄桑深於世故的妹妹。</p>
<p>爐火快熄了，煤桶裏的煤也已賸不了多少，把最後的幾塊煤投進了火爐以后，為了怕爐火熄了之後的寒冷，便都上床去睡。</p>
<p>上床以後，苓靠近檯燈，在看“中</p>
<h3>歌壇艶史</h3>
<p>— 恭聽</p>
<p>芳子姑娘是劇壇上一個著名的歌星，她有天賦的歌喉，每次登台歌唱，那“霓裳”般的艶曲，黄鶯般的歌聲，眞是傾倒四座；尤其是年青的李君，對於她更是愛慕。</p>
<p>可是有一次，她因為演唱過後，夜深歸來，以致感冒了風寒，起先是痰多咳嗽，後來漸轉咸聲嘶喉啞，她心裏是多麼的焦急啊！</p>
<p>年青的李君，得到了這消息，便趕快買了一“瓶五洲白松糖槳”，送給她調服了以後，不久她的咳嗽便止住了，喉朧也不啞了，再去歌唱，歌聲如舊，李君得到美人的垂青，其喜可知。</p>
<h3>流線化裝品</h3>
<p>— 馥郁</p>
<p>流線型的火車，汽車，飛機等，它們的效能都是特别高的，預料將來還有許多新發明，都是流線型的工具。現在，果然又有了“流線戀愛”，據説這是“衝破了調情的最高熱度！發明了求愛的最新姿態！”</p>
<p>我想：旣然有“流線戀愛”，就該有“流線化裝品”：所謂“流線化裝品”，當然是效力特別高，製法特別新的。就像五洲出品的“三一頭水”灑入髪際，得濃歷久。“三一香水”香氣清幽，醉人心意。以及“一品香”“美容霜”等，都有化醜為妍的特效，可稱為“流線化裝品騙”，堪向愛美男婦介紹。</p>

<p>天淡風閒爽氣多，數行新雁半空過。忙壞侍臣高力士，缷園中洗掃費工夫。內園秋色無窮景，到處池塘有殘荷。少頃報説明皇到，寵幸楊妃左右扶。無數桂花風馥郁，有時鸚鵡自相呼。排開御宴花亭上，海味山珍滿席舖，纖纖玉手捧金壺。君按杯，妃唱歌，霓裳妙舞世間無。太真跪進三杯酒，天子含歡把御手扶。楊妃醉到楊妃榻，一幅海棠春睡圖，見醉態醺容愈着了魔。那曉得，歡喜未完愁已到，説安祿山兵變逞干戈，直逼京師奈若何，大康天下承平久，文武朝臣禦敵無。速令六軍嚴護駕，怱怱車馬走長途，暫避鋒烟幸蜀都。可憐弱質如花女，玉碎香消一幅羅，片時賜死在馬嵬坡。</p>

<p>落霞受盡了那表少爺朱柳風的侮辱，她不但不能有一點兒反抗，反而又被趙重甫相趙太太的一頓大駡。</p>
<p>有怨無處伸，落霞跑回房裏痛哭了一陣，愈想愈覺得自己的身世太凄凉，於是她就抱了一個死的念頭，她乘趙重甫在樓上的時候，偷偷地跑到老爺的烟間裏拿了半茶杯的烟膠，等到半夜裏想用開水冲服，以了殘生；幸虧趙重甫吃烟的時候，發覺烟膠少了一點，料想恐怕落霞尋短見，忙至落霞窗前窺視，果見落霞止持碗服毒，趙重甫便將門打開，把烟膠連碗摔下。趙重甫爲了落霞這種舉動會連累他自己，第二天淸晨便把落霞送進了婦孺留養院。</p>
<p>光陰過得很快，落霞進留養院以來，已有五個多月了。院裏的章程，女孩子大了，應當照相，掛於應接室裏，讓人家看中了領了去。别的女生，照相是一件很喜</p>

<h3>二十世紀劇社重演賽金花</h3>
<p>七幕歷史國防劇「賽金花」，自去歳在本市出演後，曾哄動本市數萬的觀衆，不但本市，即蘇州，無錫的劇迷們，也曾聞風趕來上海觀看它的上演，然而作爲國防戲劇運動前衛的演出，僅靠一隅的活動是不够的，牠必須更廣泛的開展，正因爲這，二十世紀劇社費了很大的心力，經濟，排練二三個月，於廢歷年底假黄金大戲院第一次公演，奈當時恰巧各報停刋期中，而又因戲院期限太促，有多數觀衆恒抱向隅，該社有鑒於此，决於本月二十七日（星期六）假座八　橋恩派亞大戲院重演，「賽金花」與「賽金花」時代當權者的黑暗，則作爲反映目前的現實看，也未嘗不可。</p>
<h3>大光明映「劇塲血案」</h3>
<p>科學怪人與陳查禮鬥法</p>
<p>華納夏能，以專演中國大偵探陳查禮蜚聲銀壇，雖然陳查禮的影片，源源而出，但是因爲各片的內容，各有千秋，因此賣座方面，始終不减，吸引力的偉大，確足驚人。現在，二十世紀福斯公司，更請科學怪人卡洛夫和華納夏能合攝「劇塲血案」Charlie　Chan　at　The　Opera一片，這兩　　　，　在　　　當然是有好戲看了。全片充滿符兵佈與緊張，令人不寒而慄，故事叙　一個在十年前被人暗害消息毫無的名　　十年後重再駕臨劇院，報仇雪恨，演成了詭　離奇的無頭大血案。片中除米洛夫及　納夏能外，尚有中國明星陸　　恊力合演，他在這裏扮演陳查禮的兒子，地位極爲重要，演技亦頗不弱。該片今日起在大光明大戲院公映云。</p>
<h3>有錢的人最吝嗇</h3>
<p>天一的「富貴榮華」，現正加緊攝製，在裏面有一幕是描寫有錢人的吝嗇。就是蕭正中，他是一個大財主，他的女兒周美娟向他要錢買衣料，他便把一千塊錢給她。但有幾位募捐者爲了援綏，來向他募捐，他却只肯捐一塊錢，十足地顯示出他的吝嗇，真是一幕幽默的演出</p>

<p>歡的事，因爲有出院的希望了。但在落霞和那位同住在一間外房裏的同樣遭受着惡命運的馮玉如兩個人，反添上了一番心事。因爲掛了照相後，每天總有幾個人來看，這不是一件麻煩的事嗎？尤其因爲玉如屬意一個姓李的，而落霞屬意江秋鶩。所以她倆個常常推託，有病拒絶了，來看的人。</p>
<p>有一天，落霞和玉如正在閒談各人心事的時候，鄧媽跑進來再三的要落霞出去會見；落霞不得已，祗好硬着頭皮去接見。誰知寃家狹路，來見她的都是舊主人的表少爺朱柳風。</p>

<p>我自從見了你。我便把相思减我自從别了你。我又把想思害。唉！我不知是何原由。和你結下了這麽一段姻緣債。你姓甚名誰我都不曾問來。你家門遠近也不知何在。你是那裏人。你是何種人。是凡人，是仙人。我是一昧胡猜。一味的胡猜。你美麗的面龐。像桃花剛開。你軟弱的腰肢。像柳枝摇擺。唉！我呀雖個畫匠。也難描畫你這般的全材。細條條的眉毛。掩映着一排留海。深深的睫毛。擁在一汪秋水之外。兩個酒窩兒一漩。白牙露出微笑起來。我當時見了你。我怎能不愛。我現在别了你，我多麽不快。我這幾天以來。茶飲不想。是時時刻刻。糊里糊塗。是難耐難挨。</p>

<h3>Seeking Reality by Avoiding Names: Diplomacy Towards China</h3>
<p>[Z Nan Yun &gt;</p>
<p>The Core of the Hayashi Cabinet's Program</p>
<p>㊀</p>
<p>It so happened that the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in Nanjing, China, and the 70th Japanese Diet, which had been adjourned three times and then reconvened, opened on the same day. We have not yet seen what resolutions were made at the Third Plenary Session regarding the issue of the survival of the Chinese nation, and there is no need to discuss it here. Although the 70th Japanese Diet is still in session today, records of various important discussions have already been seen. There is no doubt that, generally speaking, the central topic of the 70th Diet is the policy toward China.</p>
<p>Someone asked: In this Diet, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hayashi announced the government program, which included "Clarifying the National Essence," "Strengthening National Defense and Industry," "Seeking Stability in the People's Livelihoods," "Revising the Budget Somewhat and Suppressing Prices," and "Sweeping Away Misunderstandings with China (支那),” why can it be said that the policy toward China is the central issue of this Diet?</p>
<p>We can answer that there are special matters that cannot be included under the policy toward China, such as some Diet members questioning "infringements on human rights." But generally speaking, the central issue is indeed the policy toward China.</p>
<p>㊁</p>
<p>Why? Just looking at what Prime Minister Hayashi often says is enough to understand.——</p>
<p>"One of the policies of clarifying the National Essence is to realize stability in East Asia..." Needless to say, this so-called "East Asia" includes China. "Japan is the leading force in ensuring stability in East Asia." Today's Prime Minister Hayashi is the former commander of the Korean Army. During the "September 18th Incident," it was this Commander Hayashi who believed that the three northeastern provinces were not "stable," so he "unilaterally" sent the "Kamamura Brigade" into the northeastern provinces. This kind of "unilateral action" earned him the nickname of "General Crossing the Border." Will Prime Minister Hayashi consider China to be "stable" in the future? This is a big question, and a very obvious one. Therefore, under the policy of "realizing stability in East Asia," there will always be dramas staged.</p>
<p>The so-called "strengthening national defense" ostensibly seems to be competing with the Soviet Union and the United States, etc., but the actual situation is obvious without explanation. Speaking of "revitalizing industry," in addition to keeping the Japanese working masses busy, expanding markets and seizing resources are the most important activities. Prime Minister Hayashi mentions "national defense" and "industry" together, which is befitting of an army general who is also today's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. But where are the easiest resources to obtain, and where are the nearest and largest markets? This also does not need to be answered.</p>
<p>"Seeking stability in the people's livelihoods" -- what kind of people does this "people" refer to? Regardless of any statistical survey, everyone must admit that the lives of Japanese workers and farmers are now more difficult than at any previous time (a separate article will be written to detail the recent lives and struggles of Japanese laborers). The Japanese workers and farmers are the majority of the Japanese people, however, where in Prime Minister Hayashi's policy program is there any shadow of seeking stability in the lives of workers and farmers?</p>
<p>Are "budget revisions and price suppression" one of the policies for "seeking stability in the people's livelihoods"? The budget proposed by the previous cabinet was too large (3.04 billion yuan). Can the current cabinet's proposed "revision of 270 million yuan" be said to be a policy of "seeking stability in the people's livelihoods"? Moreover, the so-called "revision" is not really cutting 270 million yuan, but rather recording this 270 million yuan in next year's account (that is, recorded on the account of the people's burden). Next year, this debt will still have to be repaid. Repaid to whom? Repaid to the military and the Ministry of the Interior, etc. The purpose of this kind of bookkeeping-style budget revision is nothing more than to reduce the burden on a portion of the capitalists and slightly ease the resistance from the masses. -- In essence, the burden on the masses will only become heavier and heavier. Moreover, in this revised account, the amount that the army and navy can temporarily "defer" is only 46 million yuan.</p>
<p>How can such a budget revision "stabilize the people's livelihoods"? If it is said that stability is sought by "suppressing prices," what are the effective measures for "suppressing prices"? Can the Hayashi cabinet forcibly reduce the profits of capitalists? What supports the Hayashi cabinet? Regarding the speed of rising prices in Japan, according to a survey by the Bank of Japan, in January of this year, the Tokyo price index had risen to 181.3 (up 14.6 from December of last year and up 22.8 from January of last year), but in London it only rose to 122.3 (up 2.6 from December of last year and up 14.6 from January of last year), and in New York it only rose to 129.0 (up 2.0 from December of last year and up 13.9 from January of last year).</p>
<p>With prices soaring like this, if the Hayashi cabinet does not advocate "suppression," then it will naturally become a target of attack. However, in Japan today, where exports are devalued, imports are mainly military supplies, and peace is also based on the military industry, how is it possible to overcome rising prices? Even if the magic weapon of "strengthening price controls" is brought out, those who will be sacrificed will only be a portion of the capitalists with weaker capital. It will be even more beneficial to Mitsui and Mitsubishi, which have already maintained monopoly prices. In the end, it is still the masses who are unstable.</p>
<p>From the above general analysis, it can be summarized as: Under the policy of realizing stability in East Asia (i.e., completing the continental policy), expand armaments and revitalize industry -- this is the Hayashi cabinet's program. In other words, it is: Under the policy toward China, expand armaments and revitalize industry.</p>
<h3>To Bailingmiao (4)</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Qian Hua</p>
<p>Let the ancient grasslands be hundreds of miles without inhabitants - The life of officers and soldiers on the icy and snowy frontier beyond the Great Wall</p>
<p>㊄</p>
<p>Freezing So Cold It Makes Your Skin Jump</p>
<p>Naturally, a well-equipped, heated office like the head of the special agency is the priority of the women. Our temporary accommodation was in a company headquarters two alleys away, in two small rooms, one-third of which was a brick kang covered with a thin layer of felt. There was a broken leather furnace in the room, burning cow dung. According to the soldiers, "In Bailingmiao, transportation is inconvenient, and there is a great panic about coal and food, especially coal, which is more precious than gold. The fuel normally used is cow and horse dung. Every day, we brothers go out and always pick up one or two hemp bags, so that everyone can keep warm, and it is even more indispensable for boiling water and cooking. The dung here burns easily, and its volatility is also high, but it is not lasting. There must be a person who continues to serve the fire constantly, otherwise, after ten minutes, the raging fire will cover the flag and die out." At this time, we had just experienced the cold, and seeing the fire was already incredibly intimate. We only felt that the smell of the dung was clear and fragrant, and we were very happy to chat with the soldiers who were serving us. After a day of laboring on the car, we were drowsy at nine o'clock, but looking at the brick kang, there was still nothing, the kang was cold, and a cold air was rising straight up, and the four walls were humid, as if entering a mountain cave in summer, which was terrible to the touch. The soldier also said: "We brothers only have this set of clothes, and we use the old sheepskin coat as a big quilt at night, and wear it during the day to keep out the cold. You distinguished guests from afar will also have to make do with it." At this time, there was still fire, so I bravely replied to them: "That's not a problem. If you can endure hardship, can't we endure one or two nights?" So the reporter also took off his leather coat, covered it on his body, used a small mirror box as a pillow, and put on a pair of galoshes on his feet, and went to bed with his clothes on. Soon, the soldiers left, the fire went out, and the cold air invaded in gusts, first from the feet, gradually cooling to the chest, and the heart was frozen to jump, shaking all over, and quickly wrapped the leather coat tightly around the head, it was really impossible to sleep on either side. Finally, it was hard to wait until the fifth watch, and the soldier ran in in the dim morning light, and quickly asked them to make dung fire, and finally survived the difficult night. It is said that the temperature in Bailingmiao in the early morning and evening is about 40 degrees below zero. In recent years, it can increase to about 20 degrees below zero. In the winter before last year, the snow on the ground was four or five feet deep, and the climate was cold to 45 degrees below zero, and many livestock and people were frozen to death.</p>
<p>㊅</p>
<p>The Calamity of the Joyful Buddha</p>
<p>Bailingmiao is commonly known as Bailing Temple. When Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty pacified Outer Mongolia and the northern route of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, he stationed troops here and built a Lama temple, so it was initially called Belle Temple. The surrounding area is undulating hills, a total of nine, like a city, and the Bailing River runs through it. Surrounded by mountains, there are large openings to the north and south, all of which can pass vehicles. There are seven small items on the east and west hills, the terrain of nine dragons spitting water, commonly known as the Jiulongkou, which is more dangerous than the Jiunmenkou of the Great Wall. The reporter spent a day touring around. From the many Lama temples in Hexi to the streets in Hedong, and then walking up the mountain, overlooking the panorama, because the slope is gentle, it is not too tiring to run up in one breath. There are sentinel posts on the top of the mountain, and the defensive fortifications are extremely tight. As far as the national defense front line of Bailingmiao is concerned, it is really special and fearful. Bailingmiao is a general term. There are more than a dozen large and small Lama temples in this circle, all of which are magnificent and rich. However, there are many bullet holes on the outer walls, and some whole blocks are missing a corner. Defensive objects such as sandbags are still piled there. The garrison puts a few small steel cannons at the missing openings, which is very mighty. These are all achievements left over from fierce battles. The carvings and paintings in the temple are very exquisite, and the golden statues of Buddha are even more solemn. Although after the war, all objects are messy and incomplete, the outline structure has not changed much. Strange gods are painted on the four walls of the main hall, especially the most incredible thing is that a woman is painted in various obscene states under the Cow King. The last hall enshrines the Joyful Buddha, but the number is unequal. The Joyful Buddha is the most sacred and inviolable Buddha statue in the Lama temple. Except for Mongolian princes and nobles, no one is allowed to enter this hall without permission. Even the princes and nobles can only enter for worship on certain days. The Yonghe Temple in Beiping also enshrines the Joyful Buddha. On the eve of the emperor's wedding, the Lama led him to the inner hall, respectfully unveiled the red cloth covering the lower part of the Joyful Buddha, and asked the emperor to visit. After the Republic of China, tourists to Yonghe Temple can also enjoy the same rights as the emperor by spending a few yuan of legal tender. There are especially many Joyful Buddhas in Bailingmiao. There are more than a dozen large and small ones in one hall. There are all kinds of obscene postures, and in terms of shape and meaning, it is indeed an insult to women in the new era, because joy is mutual, and the women portrayed in the statues are all bloody or terrified and howling. This is nothing more than showing the supreme authority of men in those years. This idea is too outdated. It is said that when the National Army attacked Bailingmiao, they all believed that such mysterious Joyful Buddha statues were out of line with the trend, so they beat them up, and the Buddha statues had broken heads, broken arms, and incomplete bodies. Only one or two out of ten were intact. It was really a great calamity for the Joyful Buddha! (To be continued)</p>

Economic construction is indeed an important plan at present. For the sake of thinking about future troubles and preventing them, we should engage in equalizing land rights and controlling capital. For the sake of increasing production, we should engage in developing state capital, while at the same time giving appropriate protection to private capital... All measures should be sought to suit the needs of national defense and the people's livelihood, and especially must adhere to the principles of the People's Livelihood, so that social interests are mutually harmonized and equally developed, so as to lead to the realm of common ownership, common governance, and common enjoyment. We will never tolerate the fallacy of class struggle, so as to cause social disturbance, nor will we create the genus of unequal wealth and poverty, so as to leave future disputes behind." The above remarks are truly fundamental arguments. If we follow this path, economic construction will surely have tangible results in a few years.</p>
<p>In recent years, the clamor for economic construction has not been low. However, in reality, it is often nothing more than empty talk. As for the so-called talents, I dare not falsely accuse them, but in reality there are many "scholars of articles and speeches." Therefore, there are not few "experts," but the progress of the cause is not much. Destruction is not unviolent, but the work of construction is limited. This is why the people have repeatedly not enjoyed the benefits of construction, but have suffered the burden of construction first. In terms of industry and commerce, the foundation is not established, and the skills are low, far from being able to reach the level of advanced countries. However, the theory of surplus and the view of class have long been deeply rooted in people's hearts. When disputes come, there is always no place for weighing the situation and considering reason, so that those with capital dare not contribute their capital, and those with labor have no way to exert their strength. Not only is the road to business farther and farther, but the panic of unemployment is also deeper and deeper. At present, the exhaustion and stagnation of industry and commerce has many causes, but this is also one of them.</p>
<p>In the future, the direction of economic construction and the measures to be taken have already been revealed by the Third Plenary Session. There is no need to repeat them. However, what we hope for is that, speaking urgently, we should focus on the construction of national defense economy. Tracing its root, it is not just from the perspective of the interests of the whole people, but must suit the needs of the people's livelihood to engage in construction. Therefore, construction should be vigorous, but also avoid acting hastily. The vision should be far-reaching, but we must not forget the reality. In short, all construction projects should be weighed between urgency, size, and timing in order to determine the order of implementation. Only in this way can construction achieve the effect of "seeking truth from facts."</p>
<p>As for the revival of industry and commerce, it is necessary to improve the knowledge and skills in operation and organization as the main plan. The industry and commerce of the past lacked this kind of spirit and ability, so that they could not resist the economic forces from outside. The accumulated habits of "worshiping the foreign and belittling the Chinese," and the inability to fully exercise tax administration are also diseases in the heart of our industry and commerce. Now that the inland handicraft industry has been defeated, only a small number of light industries remain, which are extremely fragile and cannot withstand a single blow from foreign forces. The technology of agricultural production still has not changed from the old methods of thousands of years ago. The abundance or scarcity of the harvest depends entirely on the heavens. There is no thought of using human power to avoid disasters such as floods, droughts, and insect pests. This is because they do not know what science is, and have not been able to apply science to agriculture. Today, if agriculture, industry, and commerce want to progress and be safe, they must do their best to achieve the two major goals of "agricultural scientization" and "industrial ruralization." This is also the essence of economic construction.</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff of Kwantung Army, Itagaki, Transferred to Division Commander</h3>
<p>Vacancy to be Succeeded by Tojo Hideki; Isoya Also Commander of the 10th Division</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Among the personnel changes in the army announced today, March 1st, the most noteworthy point is the transfer of Itagaki Seishiro, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, to commander of the 5th Division in Hiroshima City. The vacancy will be filled by Tojo Hideki, the current commander of the Kwantung Army Military Police. Tojo is highly praised by Prime Minister Hayashi and is a person of great courage in the Japanese army. His views are also roughly the same as Hayashi's. Moreover, with Tojo taking the position of Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, the central organization governing the Kwantung Army may be able to effectively exercise its authority to some extent in the future, and changes in the future direction of the Kwantung Army are also more likely. In addition, Isoya Renzo, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, has been transferred to commander of the 10th Division. The vacant position of Director of the Military Affairs Bureau will be filled by Kogu. Ishihara has been promoted to lieutenant general and appointed as Director of the 1st Department of the General Staff Headquarters. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Britain Actively Prepares for Wartime and Strengthens Air Defense</h3>
<p>Auxiliary Firefighting Organizations Established Throughout the Country, 200,000 Firefighters Trained</p>
<p>[London] Britain is actively preparing for emergency times, and now there is one more clarification, that is, according to the latest report, auxiliary firefighting organizations will be established throughout Britain. The purpose is to resist the arson of incendiary bombs in the event of an air raid. It is said that the new organization requires 200,000 personnel, and each person needs three months of training to become an effective firefighter. The minimum number of personnel recruited for this plan is 100,000, because a large bomber can carry ten small incendiary bombs. If the air is gained, then the city of London alone needs at least 20,000 firefighters. Each of these firefighters should be given equipment expenses of £5 and an additional £3. Auxiliary fire brigades will be established throughout the country, powerful firefighting equipment will be added, and patrol teams will be organized, so that women can also join in some kind of service.</p>
<p>The above plan was announced by Home Secretary Simon in the House of Commons today. It includes a large amount of storage of firefighting equipment for emergency times in peacetime, such as high-power jet machines, fire-fighting trailers, belts, etc. Temporary firefighting teams, patrol teams, and fire stations should also be organized in advance, so that each street is under constant attention, and in the event of a fire, it can be put out at any time, so as not to spread into a disaster. Therefore, in peacetime, the majority of the people must be properly trained so that they can join the full-time or part-time firefighting work in emergency times.</p>
<p>The current government is considering the local authorities' presentation of all the expenses for the necessary firefighting equipment and firefighting teams in emergency times. After the government decides in the future, it will allocate corresponding firefighting machinery, belts, and other equipment according to the needs of various places and the approved defense plans of various places. As for the initial training of this auxiliary firefighting organization and equipment expenses, as well as future budgets, etc., they will be subsidized by the government. The existing local firefighting organizations should still exist, but what is being prepared is the organization between regions, and local authorities should cooperate with it.

<h3>French Foreign Minister Explains Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Promote European Peace, Senate Trusts the Government</p>
<p>[Paris] The Senate met this afternoon to discuss the government's foreign policy. As a result, by a large majority of 213 votes to 1, it passed a motion of confidence in the government. During the discussion, most senators raised questions on various issues such as the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty, the situation in Spain, the domestic war of volunteers from various countries, and the relations between France and Italy. Foreign Minister Daladier replied to each item. The Foreign Minister said, "Any country can join the treaties that France has signed with other countries. France will definitely abide by this kind of treaty system. At the same time, France is ready to participate in any negotiations that can promote European peace. In short, the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty, the agreements signed between France and the countries of the Little Entente, and the alliance with Poland are all extremely strong." Referring to the issue of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War, he said that the method of non-interference was first advocated by France. The government now has the determination to recall all French volunteers who are currently fighting in Spain, but on the condition that other countries do the same. Referring to the relations between Britain and France, he said that the situation is very good. "In addition, our relationship with the United States and its President Roosevelt is also very close because we have common ideals. This level should also have infinite value for world peace." Referring to France's relations with Germany, he said, "Since Germany has made a statement of peace, it is deeply hoped that it will not continue with the proposal to expand armaments. If so, the relations between France and Germany can be improved more easily." Finally, referring to the recent Mediterranean Gentleman's Agreement signed between Britain and Italy, he said that this agreement also protects France's interests in the Mediterranean.

<h3>Supreme Council of the Fascist Party</h3>
<p>Regarding the Current Diplomatic Situation, Ciano Will Present a Report</p>
<p>[Rome] The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party is scheduled to meet next Monday. The most important matter at this meeting will be the Foreign Minister Ciano's diplomatic report. According to well-informed sources, Ciano intends to present a lengthy report at the meeting to elaborate on various important diplomatic issues. To name a few, one is that the United States has adopted a huge armament policy, which has affected the naval situation of Italy in the Mediterranean. The second is that after the recent visit of the German Foreign Minister to the Austrian authorities, there will be new developments in the relations between Germany, Austria, and Italy. The Austrian Prime Minister is scheduled to visit Italy at the end of March, which is not far away, and preparations should be made in advance. The third is that the relationship between Italy and the countries of the Little Entente should be re-examined. In addition, the Secretary-General of the Fascist Party will report on the increase in the number of party members at the meeting, and the Minister of Education will report on the continued decline in the birth rate in Italy.

<h3>Ethiopian Emperor Invited to Attend British King's Coronation</h3>
<p>Rome Believes British Action Violates Spirit of Mediterranean Agreement</p>
<p>[London] The British King is scheduled to hold his coronation ceremony on May 12th. The Ethiopian Embassy in London has confirmed that the British government has invited the Emperor of Abyssinia to attend this grand event. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>[Rome] According to a statement released by the Abyssinian Embassy, former Emperor Haile Selassie will send a representative to attend the coronation of the British King instead of personally attending. This matter has recently attracted considerable attention. It is understood that the Italian side has informally expressed that if the former Emperor of Abyssinia and his small remaining faction still participate in the ceremony under the name of "Emperor of Abyssinia," it will be impossible for Italy to send a representative to participate. The Italian side also believes that the British invitation to Selassie is inconsistent with the spirit of the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Agreement. However, if the British side does not change its predetermined arrangements, Italy will be represented by Prince and Princess di Piemonte to attend the ceremony. However, whether they will come to England is not yet officially indicated here. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Political figures here declare that if the British government does invite the Ethiopian Emperor to attend the coronation of the British King, the tense relationship between Britain and Italy will inevitably be reignited. The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party may discuss this issue at length when it meets on March 1st. In addition, Britain's large-scale military expansion plan has also caused great concern among political figures here, and it may be studied together at that time. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<h3>Former Ethiopian Emperor's Advisor, Colson, Dies in the United States</h3>
<p>[Washington] Mr. Colson, an American who once served as an advisor to the Ethiopian Emperor, passed away in Washington today. Although Colson did not stand out during his tenure in Abyssinia, his role was extremely important during the Italian conquest of Ethiopia. Most of the documents sent by the Ethiopian Emperor to the great powers and the League of Nations were written by Colson. These documents were known for their solemn wording and skillful arguments, which were the biggest reason why the world expressed sympathy for the Ethiopian Emperor. In addition, Colson was also responsible for Ethiopia's external propaganda. Journalists from various countries who covered the Ethiopian war were able to attest to Colson's outstanding talent.

<p>[Berlin] The German government recently ordered all residents to submit a copy of their front door key to the nearest police precinct for safekeeping.

<h3>End of German-Austrian Talks</h3>
<p>Communiqué Only Mentions Commonplace Events; Foreign Minister Neurath Returns to Berlin</p>
<p>[Vienna] German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit here has concluded, and he departed for his country in the evening. The official communiqué on the talks between Neurath and Prime Minister Schuschnigg has been released, stating only that Germany and Austria share completely identical views on maintaining European peace. It also stated that the agreement signed by the two countries on July 11th of last year contains various provisions that are an appropriate basis for restoring friendly and sincere relations between the two countries, and that the economic agreement signed by the two countries on January 27th of this year is also sufficient to promote the development of mutual economic relations between the two countries. All of this is satisfactory to Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Neurath. The communiqué concludes by stating that the two countries will establish a special committee to deal with various issues related to cultural relations between the two countries. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Vienna] After completing discussions with Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg today, German Foreign Minister Neurath departed for Berlin. The Austrian government issued a communiqué on the discussions between the two politicians, only mentioning commonplace events. This proves that there were no major decisions made during the talks. Although the authorities deny Neurath's proposal that Germany, Italy, Austria, and Hungary conclude a defense agreement, external sources continue to assert it, and say that Schuschnigg's visit to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in March will take this as the main topic of discussion. According to political circles, Austria cannot even give preliminary approval to this matter without Mussolini's full consent. At the same time, Schuschnigg has not made any concessions on the issue of Austrian restoration, while Germany is strongly opposed to this move. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Vienna] Neurath issued a statement to the Austrian official news agency, claiming that his two-day stay in Austria should be regarded as a natural result of the racial relationship between Germany and Austria, and should not be regarded as an action with political significance. Before departing for his country, Neurath also issued a statement to the Italian official news agency, declaring that increased understanding between Germany and Austria can assist Hitler and Mussolini's peace policies. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Austria, The Times recently published a message from its Vienna correspondent, stating that Neurath's trip discussed neither the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg royal family nor the issue of German annexation, but rather the issue of the annexation of Czechoslovakia. It is said that German Aviation Minister Göring has just returned to his country from a meeting in Poland. The Czech government and the German minority in its territory are also currently conducting negotiations, and Neurath's visit to Austria at this time is of particular significance, as Czechoslovakia is geographically located between Austria and Poland. The newspaper concludes, "Germany's offensive on the colonial issue has now failed. It is not impossible for it to throw another bomb in Europe or expand outward." (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Newspapers here continue to comment on the Austrian issue. Among them, Mrs. Tabouis, a diplomatic reporter for the L'œuvre newspaper, declared, "It is generally believed that the Austrian Prime Minister is prepared to make a last-ditch effort against National Socialism and clearly propose a principle to European countries, that countries have only two paths to follow: either allow Germany and Austria to merge, or directly restore the Austrian monarchy." Mrs. Tabouis also stated that the claim that Germany and Italy have already reached a certain agreement on the Austrian issue has recently become very strong. The same news is also published in "Le Populaire", stating, "Some people believe that an agreement has been reached between Germany and Italy, stipulating that Germany can act freely within the territory of Czechoslovakia, but on the condition of abandoning the plan to merge Germany and Austria." L'Humanité, the Communist Party newspaper, said, "Hitler and Mussolini have almost agreed to divide spheres of influence in the Balkan Peninsula and completely destroy the collective security organization of the Balkan countries." Le Temps also said, "The recent visit of the German Foreign Minister to Austria has not only failed to change the current uneasy situation, but has also exacerbated it." (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Poland Delineates Border Security Zone</h3>

In addition, a zone of two to six kilometers is delineated along the border, and no one within it is allowed to possess telephones, radios, or homing pigeons. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<h3>19th Anniversary of the Soviet Red Army</h3>

<p>[Moscow] Today, the entire Soviet Union celebrates the 19th anniversary of the Red Army. Marshal Vorošilov, the People's Commissar for Defense, issued special instructions, stating, "The socialist victories recorded in the Stalinist Constitution have made our country, in one-sixth of the world's land, a prosperous homeland for socialist builders. Under the love and protection of the Soviet Union, the Red Army will repel any attack and wipe out any enemy who attempts to disturb the peaceful labor, happy life, and property of our people."

<h3>Maritime Monitoring of Spain Divided Among Countries</h3>
<p>Effective from Next Month, the 6th; Soviet Union Has Not Finally Agreed</p>
<p>[London] The Non-Intervention Committee on the control of arms entering Spain during the Spanish Civil War has now passed the distribution plan for maritime monitoring of the Spanish coast. The northern coast will be the responsibility of Britain and Portugal, the northwest coast will be the responsibility of France and the Soviet Union, the southern coast from the Spanish-Portuguese border to Almería will be the responsibility of Britain, and from Almería to the Spanish-French border will be the responsibility of Germany and Italy. In addition, France will monitor the islands of Ibiza and Majorca, Italy will monitor the island of Minorca, France will monitor Spanish Morocco, and Britain will monitor the Canary Islands and Livorno. The Soviet Union has not yet given final acceptance to the area it has been allocated. Because its closest naval base is the Black Sea, the Soviet Union is willing to defend the eastern coast of Spain, but the area it has been temporarily allocated includes a part of the Bay of Biscay, and the Soviet Union has little interest in stationing troops there. It is also stipulated that the monitoring ships of each country should patrol within ten miles of the Spanish coast and are assumed to have the right to board and inspect any ships approaching the Spanish coast. This plan and the land control measures will take effect simultaneously on March 6th. The cost of British warship patrols will be paid by the British government. According to reliable estimates, the British government will also have to pay £100,000 annually for land patrol costs, which is about 16% of the total cost. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 24th)</p>

<h3>French Aviators Visit Japan by Air</h3>
<p>Departed from Paris the Night Before; First Leg Completed</p>
<p>[Paris] Famous aviators Denys and Libeert departed from the Vélizy-Villacoublay airfield here at 10:05:34 last night, flying a "Caudron Simoun" aircraft to Tokyo, Japan, attempting to complete the entire journey in less than 100 hours to win the 400,000 franc prize set by the Ministry of Aviation. Although the aircraft carries a load of 1,800 kilograms, it took off within 26 seconds of starting and disappeared from sight in a moment.</p>
<p>The planned landing points for this trip include Athens, Basra in Iraq, Karachi in India, Allahabad in India, Akyab in Burma, Hanoi in Vietnam, Shanghai, and Tokyo in Japan. Since last autumn, French aviators have participated in this long-distance flight many times. Among them, Yapi departed alone in November and was in very good condition along the way. Unexpectedly, near Kyushu Island in Japan, the aircraft crashed into a mountain and was seriously injured, resulting in failure at the last minute. Later, aviators Dollé and Micheletti departed again in January of this year, but were forced to land on an island in the Gulf of Tonkin in Vietnam. Due to aircraft damage, they had to abandon the trip. Now, Denys and Libeert are following their example and making this heroic feat. Their courage and perseverance are admirable. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<h3>US Policy Towards Europe</h3>
<p>Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>[Washington] State Department officials said that Ambassador to France Bullitt's speech did not state that the United States has any intention of changing its policy on European issues or disarmament issues. As for French commentators who believe that Bullitt slightly indicated that the United States intends to cooperate with Britain and France to provide loans to Germany so that Germany can reduce its armaments, State Department officials said that Bullitt's words are actually consistent with the opinions publicly announced by Secretary of State Hull and other senior officials in the past.

<h3>Gan Security Corps Implements Land Reclamation</h3>
<p>Starting with Planting Tung Trees</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Since the pacification of bandits in Jiangxi Province, the newly recovered areas require local security forces to maintain order. Therefore, the security corps have been expanding daily, now reaching over twenty regiments. However, due to the devastation after the banditry, the countryside is riddled with problems, making it difficult to bear the cost of the corps. Therefore, the Security Bureau has decided to implement land reclamation by the corps, turning soldiers into producers to reduce the burden on the people. The reclamation policy starts with planting tung trees. The needed land will be public or unclaimed barren mountains. Large-scale reclamation areas will first be opened up along the Nanchang-Xunyang, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Jiangxi-Hunan, Jiangxi-Austria, and Jiangxi-Fujian transportation lines as models, and then gradually expanded. Now that spring has arrived, and it is the time for planting trees, the Security Bureau has purchased a large number of tung tree seedlings, along with printed "Guidelines for Planting Tung Trees," and ordered the security commanders of each district and the heads of each security corps to engage in planting tung trees on designated barren mountains and wasteland for those non-district corps and those not included in the bandit suppression combat sequence. After the tung oil trees have achieved success, then consider grains and animal husbandry.</p>

<p>Water Patrol Team Captures Stolen Goods</p>
<p>Recently, theft cases have been occurring frequently in the vicinity of the city. For example, on the evening of the 14th, the home of Zhang Yongjin in Erli Jing, north of the city, and on the night of the 22nd, the home of Xu Zhuyu in Sixian Port, were both robbed. Xu Zhuyu was also beaten. Reports were filed for investigation. On the morning of the 23rd, Fei Gongxia, the captain of the water patrol team, captured three suspected thieves, Shi Rengui, Gong Kunshu, and Wang Ayong, at the Phoenix Mountain Bridge in the city. Stolen goods such as burlap sacks, clothing, and copper-tin utensils were found. According to their confession, there were other accomplices hiding in the Huang Shuntai cigarette paper shop in Caojiadu, Shanghai. However, Gong Kunshu claimed to be a ticket seller at the Xiyuan Amusement Park and denied being a thief. Captain Fei recalled that the previous night, a felt hat with a postcard inside, bearing an address matching the address provided by Shi and others, was left behind by thieves at the home of Ni Erlin in Chongwen Street in the city. He then led detectives Gu Lansheng and Tang Shuqin to Shanghai and, together with the Caojiadu police station, dispatched police to assist in arresting five thieves, Chen Asan, Chen Alian, Zhang Ahe, Yin Amai, and Tao Ahe, at the address. The Shanghai police took them to the station for temporary detention. Captain Fei returned to Songjiang on the evening train and reported to the police chief to prepare a document to send the captain back to Shanghai on the 24th to bring them back for interrogation. The victim, Xu Zhuyu, upon hearing of the capture of the thieves, went to the team headquarters and identified many of the stolen goods. Xu Zhuyu was severely injured while resisting the thieves, having been violently beaten with wooden sticks containing nails. He is currently hospitalized for treatment. It is reported that among the thieves captured in Shanghai, there is a fugitive from the Zhang Shunxian matricide case.</p>

<p>The Lion's Mouth in the east of the city was originally a remote place with few residents. Last year, a bureau was established to facilitate transportation, and the Xiangmen gate was opened there, so the number of residents gradually increased. However, the Xiangmen police station has not yet been established. Unexpectedly, at about 10 pm on the 23rd, the Wang Hecheng Hotel at the Lion's Mouth, which had already closed its doors, was suddenly approached by a robber holding a pistol. Pretending to be a wine buyer, the owner opened the door, and the robber immediately entered, demanding silence. He broke into the bedroom and robbed 50 yuan in cash, then went out the door and fled towards Cang Street. Afterwards, the owner reported the robbery to the police for investigation. A strict search was conducted all night, but there was no trace of the robber.

Now, all the female workers of the factory have been recruited, and full-scale day and night operations began on the 22nd. There are a total of 31,000 yarn spindles and 250 looms. However, after the factory began operations, there is not only no surplus of workers in this area, but there is also a great shortage.

<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Lantern Market and Wheat Harvest Both Damaged</p>
<p>Since the snowfall on the first day of the lunar new year in Yangzhou City, the weather has changed from warm to cold, and after only two sunny days, it has been cloudy and rainy again for nearly ten days without a single clear day. The roads are muddy. The Yangzhou Lantern Market, which has a long-standing reputation, usually generates over 20,000 yuan in business, but this year the total sales are less than 3,000 yuan. Those who rely on this for a living have suffered great losses. On the 23rd, in the midst of cloudy and rainy weather, small hailstones the size of beans suddenly fell at about 1 pm, the finer ones like pearls, and lasted for two hours before stopping. More than half of the newly sprouting wheat in the countryside has been damaged, which will seriously affect the wheat harvest.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Ministry Officials Inspect Bridge Construction</p>
<p>Of the bridges built on the Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway passing through the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan area, except for the four bridges of Ruanshe, Qiaoqi, Chang'an, and Dengyun, the remaining seventy-one bridges were built with reduced labor and materials and were not constructed according to the river courses. As a result, the original river channels have become curved and unable to drain smoothly. In the future, if there is a flood, it will easily become a major disaster. Various legal groups have submitted requests to the provincial and central governments for relief regarding the damage to farmland and water conservancy. Now, the case has been delegated by the Ministry of Railways to Division Chief Sa Fujun to come to Shaoxing, accompanied by Cao Duan, the director of engineering, Zhang Haiping, and Dong Kaizhang, the engineer of the Shaoshan Duan Tangzha project, to inspect various locations and find ways to improve the situation.</p>

<p>Cibei People's Education Center Burned Down</p>
<p>The Cixi County government previously established a people's education center in Guanhaiwei in Cibei, which was officially established on the first of this month. The center was located in the old Guandi Temple, which contained many superstitious idols. In order to facilitate office work and eliminate superstition, the center's preparatory committee decided to move the idols to Yue Temple. Unexpectedly, this aroused the resentment of the villagers. On the afternoon of the 21st, several hundred people suddenly gathered and rushed into the center. The director and staff of the center received the news in advance and quickly escaped through the back door, barely escaping with their lives. After entering the center, the rioters destroyed the center's belongings and set it on fire. After receiving the report, the county government dispatched two supervisors to the countryside to cooperate with the local public security bureau to deal with the aftermath and investigate and arrest the ringleaders of the riot. It is reported that the center's losses exceeded 2,000 gold.</p>

<h3>Private Schools in the First Special District Petition Regarding the Concession's Subsidy Fees</h3>
<p>▲ Petitioned the Municipal Government and Other Agencies Yesterday</p>
<p>Private schools in the First Special District of this city, citing the encroachment of the Concession on educational administrative power regarding subsidy fees, and deliberate fault-finding, have previously collectively opposed this issue. The tense work of the meetings and various situations have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the association convened another general meeting yesterday, attended by representatives from various schools, including Lin Zhengong, Wu Jize, Li Guixiong, Xu Renhan, Chen Peiming, Feng Shuhua, and 174 others. The presidium included Cui Jianji, Feng Yixian, Zhang Lingfei, Zhang Tianbai, and Tang Zengyang. Jin Yuezhang was the recorder, and Wang Baoxi, Ge Youren, Qi Yiying, and Feng Dafu were the hosts. First, the chairman reported on the recent association affairs, stating that members of the association now account for nine-tenths of the private schools in the district. All the previously decided matters have been carried out separately. However, various schools have successively received notices from the Concession stating that if they do not comply with its regulations, they will be ordered to demolish the schools within a certain period. There have been no fewer than 50 or 60 such cases. The entire meeting unanimously expressed their indignation and decided to immediately petition various Party and government agencies. At that time, it was raining heavily, but all the representatives were full of energy. Led by Weng Guoxun, and with Zhang Lingfei as the disciplinarian, they first went to the Municipal Party Headquarters, where they were received by Zhou Funong, the director of the Civil Training Section. He expressed sympathy for the various points of the petition. They then went to the Municipal Government, where Mayor Wu sent Secretary Hang to receive them, promising to forward the petition. Next, they went to the Social Affairs Bureau, where Director Pan sent Section Chief Jiang to receive them. Regarding the encroachment on educational administrative power, which concerns sovereignty, they would naturally argue on principle. They would separately find ways to negotiate on all the points of the petition, striving for a satisfactory result. The representatives were satisfied. Finally, they went to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, where Secretary Tao Ledong received them and gave a detailed report on the Concession's subsidy fees. He also expressed his willingness to argue on principle. The representatives left with excitement. It is reported that the association is willing to continue the struggle with maximum effort and a tenacious attitude regarding the various points of this petition. (Shanghai News Agency)</p>

<h3>Zhou Bangdao Discusses His Impressions of Inspecting Education in Shaanxi and Gansu</h3>
<p>▲ Gansu Education Gradually Returning to Its Former State ▲ Sat Idle in Lanzhou for Seventy Days</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent Supervisor Zhou Bangdao to inspect education in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Coincidentally, he was in Xi'an during the incident and was stranded in Lanzhou. He waited for air traffic to resume before returning to Beijing a few days ago. In a recent interview with the Ministry of Education, he summarized the matters related to education that could be recorded, as follows: Zhou inspected the education administration and schools in various parts of Shaanxi and Gansu for more than ten days. When he arrived in Lanzhou, it coincided with the incident of November 12th. Zhou could not leave the bathing place even one step during his leisure time. However, he heard the sound of gunfire and bullets outside the door of the bathing place. After one night, at eight or nine o'clock the next morning, Zhou went out and returned to the Lishi Club, but could not enter. After many twists and turns, he temporarily lived in the state-run Guanzhou Women's Vocational School. Living in the school was relatively peaceful and undisturbed. However, because of the blocked transportation, he could not see the news from the southern newspapers and did not know any news, which was very depressing. Zhou sat idle and bored in Lanzhou for seventy days. As a result, his spirit and body have been affected, with discomfort such as chest tightness and dizziness. It is estimated that he can recover his original state after a short period of rest. It is also reported that when Zhou was inspecting in Xi'an, he felt that the local academic atmosphere was not good. The former Director of Education, Zhou Xuechang, failed to turn the tide and has already resigned. The provincial government has been reorganized and has appointed Zhou Bomin to succeed him. It is hoped that the new appointee will uphold the central government's educational objectives and rectify the academic atmosphere, and the future can be improved. Gansu was only indirectly affected by this incident, and the impact was small. Now the schools have gradually returned to their former state, and the Director of the Provincial Department of Education, Tian Jiongjin, has been in office for many years and has a good leadership role in education administration.</p>

<p>▲ Promoted by the Provincial New Life Movement Association</p>
<p>The Provincial New Life Movement Association recently received a notice from the General Association, stating that in order to promote student labor service that is practical and relevant to life, and to promote efficiency in the new life of various primary and secondary schools, a method for launching a school road and school garden building movement has been specially formulated and issued to local education authorities for unified and earnest implementation. It is reported that after receiving the document, the association will issue a notice to schools at all levels within days to promote the movement. The original text of the method is recorded as follows: ㊀ Among the labor services of the school, building school roads and school gardens can best demonstrate the spirit of service. It can facilitate transportation, assist in construction, beautify the environment, and get close to nature, which has a great impact on students' practical life. ㊁ For building roads, surveying and determining the route, whether the road to be opened is inside or outside the school, should be considered in many ways in advance to determine which route is appropriate. If necessary, consult with the local public works and technical institutions to repair and open up the original route as the principle. Prepare materials according to the nature of the road to be built, prepare various needed materials such as cement, stones, soil, ash, sand, etc. The materials used for building roads outside the school can be supplied by the local public works agency.

Judge the spirit, order, and solidity of the road building by each school, and send personnel from the local New Life Movement Association and the public works agency to conduct inspections and evaluate the merits and demerits for awards. ㊂ For gardening, select a location and use vacant and abandoned land inside or outside the school as a school garden. Once the location is selected, design and start construction, prepare tools, prepare various tools to be used, as well as flowers, grass, and seedlings to be planted. Allocate labor. Teachers, students, and workers should all participate in the labor. The time is the same as road construction, so as not to hinder internal classes. After planting, select people with rich interests and experience among students and teachers to be responsible for management, guidance, distribution, and regular irrigation and cultivation. Organize the school garden, (add some organization to the original one) The organizing work should include weeding, pruning, transplanting, fertilizing, and repairing garden paths and drainage ditches, and should be organized properly according to the season and climate. The organizing time should be mobilized at any time as needed according to the situation. Those familiar with gardening should be responsible for technical guidance. ㊃ Schools at all levels across the country should widely launch the two tasks of road construction and gardening. The standards to be achieved by the end of the 26th year [of the Republic] are: 1. In terms of road construction, each school should be able to complete the roads outside and inside its school gate. 2. In terms of gardening and organizing the school garden, each school should be able to complete one. ㊄ The local New Life Movement Association and education administrative agencies are responsible for supervising and inspecting this work.</p>

<h3>Preparatory Plan for the Seventh National Games</h3>
<p>▲The selection of members of the organizing committee has been largely determined, and gliding will be added as a sport. ▲It is also planned to hold an exhibition of domestic sports equipment and publications for youth.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Nanjing) The Seventh National Games should be held in the capital during the Double Ten Festival of this year, in accordance with the Ministry of Education's announced measures for holding the National Games. Seeing that the preparations for previous National Games were rushed, resulting in them not being as satisfactory as desired, the Ministry of Education began preparing for this National Games early. In January, the Ministry approved the preparatory plan for this National Games and solicited opinions from various relevant parties regarding the selection of members for the organizing committee. The current status of preparations for this National Games, as learned from inquiries, is roughly described as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ The selection of members of the organizing committee has been largely determined, and after submitting them to the Minister of Education for final approval, letters of appointment will be sent separately.</p>
<p>㊁ The organizational structure of the organizing committee will still follow the model of the fifth and sixth games. The organizing committee will have several standing committee members and two committees for review and competition, as well as a chief and deputy secretary. Under the competition committee, there will be six groups for venue allocation, martial arts judging, record-keeping, and prizes. Under the chief and deputy secretaries, there will be groups for affairs, accounting, documents, transportation, security, reception, health, and publicity.</p>
<p>㊂ Regarding the competition rules, the competition rules of the previous National Games will still be applied, but in order to encourage more people to participate in sports, the competition time will be slightly reduced to allow for the addition of group exercises and model teaching programs.</p>
<p>㊃ It is heard that the budget for the games will be handled in the same way as the fifth games, but because the activities of this games have increased, the budget is slightly higher than the fifth games (the budget for the fifth games was over 130,000 yuan). It is heard that the budget proposal has been prepared and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review by the Ministry of Education in the coming days, after which the Ministry of Finance will allocate the funds.</p>
<p>㊄ In order to increase interest in aviation and actively cultivate aviation talents, this National Games plans to universally promote gliding. It is heard that the Central Aviation School has already manufactured a glider, and a gliding expert who has just returned from Germany will come to the meeting to perform.</p>
<p>㊅ It has been decided to hold an exhibition of domestic sports equipment, scouting supplies, and sports publications during the games to increase the general public's interest in sports from various aspects. However, whether this exhibition can be held as scheduled still requires the consent of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<h3>Pinghan Railway Football Team Scheduled to Play against Lyceum</h3>
<p>▲Sunday afternoon at Shen Garden</p>
<p>After the Wuhan Pinghan Railway football team arrived in Shanghai for an expedition, the competition schedule has been slow to be determined. This is because the Shanghai Chinese and Western teams have mostly gone to Hong Kong for inter-port competitions. Although the Western inter-port team returned to Shanghai a few days ago, the Chinese team will also arrive in Shanghai today. However, Western football leagues have been suspended for a long time and are about to end. Therefore, the Western teams have matches every week and have little time to spare. Moreover, all teams except the Lyceum military team have their own jobs and are not willing to be too tired. Therefore, although the team has entrusted the Sports Association to arrange the competition, it is feared that a satisfactory result will be difficult to achieve. Currently, in addition to the scheduled match against Lyceum at Shen Garden at 3:00 PM on Sunday, the French team hopes to win the Western League Division A championship, and there are still many games left, so it is feared that they cannot make the appointment. As for the Chinese team, it depends on the return of the Shanghai Chinese team today.</p>

<h3>Liang Hejun Discusses Capital and Deposit Income Tax Filing</h3>
<p>Simple Procedures, Hoping to Comply with the Deadline - Deadline Set by the Ministry, Difficult to Extend Again</p>
<p>The Shanghai Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance is collecting various types of income tax. The deadline for companies and businesses in the city to file their capital and deposit information is the end of this month. Failure to file by the deadline will be considered concealment and will be subject to penalties. As the deadline is approaching, the office has issued a notice urging people to file, and many people have been filing with the office in recent days. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Liang Hejun, the director of the Shanghai Income Tax Office, and asked if the deadline would be extended again. Mr. Liang replied that the deadline for profit-making businesses to file their capital amount was originally limited to the end of January of this year, but at the request of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, it was submitted to the Ministry and approved for a one-month extension. The deadline for filing the deposit information of businesses has also been limited to the end of February. Now that the deadline has arrived, the office has not only published notices urging people to file, but also sent letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to convene trade associations to urge their members to file separately. As for whether the deadline can be extended again, the office has not received instructions from the Ministry and cannot answer. However, according to the office's view, the income tax implementation rules originally stipulated only one month for filing. If it is extended again after already being extended for one month, the Ministry may find it difficult to approve. Therefore, I hope that the business community will still comply with the deadline. Moreover, the filing procedure is very simple, requiring only a few minutes to fill out. The reason why the general business community feels it is difficult is actually due to two misunderstandings: ㊀ They mistakenly believe that capital is an asset and think that it must be appraised, which has led to delays and hesitation. ㊁ They mistakenly believe that after filing the capital, they will be restricted, not knowing that if there is an increase or decrease in the capital amount after filing, they can still file for a change.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen and Others Prepare to Organize a Grain Transportation and Sales Company</h3>
<p>Total Capital Temporarily Set at 10 Million National Currency - Initiator Meeting Scheduled to be Held Soon - Adjusting Domestic Grain Surpluses and Deficits to Balance Prices</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, regarding the matter of adjusting the rice shortage in Guangdong Province and organizing a grain transportation and sales company, a reporter from Xin Xin News Agency visited Mr. Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council who is in charge of the preparations, yesterday afternoon to inquire about the truth.</p>
<p>Origin of Organization</p>
<p>It is understood that the organization of the company originated after Mr. Song Ziwen went to Guangdong Province last year to inspect. When Mr. Song visited Guangdong, it was during the rice panic in Guangdong Province. Mr. Song used his economic vision to pay attention to the national rice problem. China was originally an agricultural country, but in recent years, there have been frequent grain panics. The quantity of imported foreign rice is lacking. Taking Guangdong Province as an example, 8 million to 10 million dan are imported annually, costing approximately 80 million to 100 million yuan. The huge loss is appalling. However, considering the rice produced in China, such as the production in Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces, there are no statistics on the production amount, and the degree of scarcity has become a question. If this phenomenon is allowed to continue, it will not only affect the people's livelihood, but also harm the national economy. Therefore, since returning from the inspection, he has taken the opinions of people in Guangdong Province on improving grain and collected opinions from all parties. After detailed research, he decided to organize a transportation and sales company.</p>
<p>Three Main Points</p>
<p>Mr. Song's principles include three main points: ㊀ To sincerely adjust the domestic rice surplus and deficit, transporting and selling it in a timely manner, so that surplus areas avoid congestion and low prices that harm farmers, and deficit areas do not have to buy foreign rice, preventing the outflow of resources. The goal is to eliminate contradictory phenomena and recover some of the losses. ㊁ To balance prices, so that market prices do not rise or fall sharply throughout the year. If grain prices are too low, farmers will not be able to profit, and if grain prices are too high, the livelihood of the common people will be difficult. ㊂ The company's organization is commercial in nature, so in addition to investment from the banking industry and overseas Chinese, it is hoped that domestic grain merchants will join the company to make it a purely privately-run grain transportation agency.</p>
<p>Steps in Progress</p>
<p>Preparations have been underway for two months. In order to make the operation commercially economical, it has not been announced to the outside world, so the plan is very ambitious, but the progress is very steady, in order to avoid exaggeration and neglect of the facts. After the company is established, the initial transportation and sales will first be from rice-producing areas such as Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan to Guangdong and Fujian provinces, because these two provinces are the most rice-deficient areas, and then gradually expand to the rest of the country. The rice that is transported and sold will focus on high-quality rice, so that rural areas will pay attention to improving rice varieties and improving the quality of rice. Whether the company name will be "China Grain Transportation and Sales Company" remains to be decided. The capital amount is tentatively set at 10 million yuan. An initiator meeting is planned to be held in the near future. In addition to Mr. Song himself, participants will also include Sun Zhesheng, Wu Tiecheng, and other Guangdong natives, as well as many leaders from the banking industry.</p>
<h3>Liu Luyin Arrested in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Related to the Tang and Yang Assassination Cases</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that Central Committee member Liu Luyin was arrested in front of the Yangtze Hotel yesterday morning at 1:30 AM by officers from the Old Zha Police Station in conjunction with detectives from the Police Bureau, due to his involvement in the assassination cases of Tang Youren and Yang Yongtai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival History</p>
<p>Mr. Liu had been residing in Hong Kong for years. This time, he traveled north from Hong Kong to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, intending to pass through Shanghai to Beijing before the session opened. However, on the 21st, before the session concluded, he came to Shanghai in advance and stayed in room 612 of the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road.</p>
<p>Reason for Arrest</p>
<p>Mr. Liu was involved in the assassination cases of Tang Youren and Yang Yongtai in the past two years. Definite evidence has been found. The Municipal Police Bureau was ordered to dispatch several detectives to arrange the arrest, while also informing the police station to assist in the arrest. The Special District Court issued an arrest warrant, which was handed over to the police station for execution.</p>
<p>Details of the Arrest</p>
<p>At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, Mr. Liu, accompanied by his wife, left the Yangtze Hotel. As they reached the gate, detectives from the Police Bureau who were waiting outside stepped forward to arrest him. Mr. Liu refused to comply, arguing that the officers had not shown him an arrest warrant, leading to a dispute. At this time, six Chinese and foreign detectives from the Old Zha Police Station also arrived and took Mr. and Mrs. Liu to the police station. His wife was later released as she was not involved in the case.</p>
<p>Court Hearing</p>
<p>At around 8:00 AM, the police station escorted Mr. Liu to the First Special District Court. The court session began at 10:00 AM, with Judge Feng Shide presiding alongside the clerk. First, the police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, described the details of the arrest. Mr. Liu denied any involvement in the two assassination cases. Lawyer Ru requested an investigation and permission to postpone the transfer for another hearing. Mr. Liu's defense lawyer, Wang Shou'an, requested that he be allowed bail pending trial. Judge Feng declared that the case would be reheard on Monday morning and that Mr. Liu would be temporarily detained. Therefore, Mr. Liu was taken back by the police station at 11:00 AM. It is said that the police bureau will request a transfer during the next hearing.</p>
<p>Special Treatment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, considering Liu Min's status as a Central Committee member, gave him special treatment. He was held alone in a room within the Old Zha Police Station and was not subjected to any restraints, unlike other common criminals. It is said that Mr. Liu's bedding and food were provided by his wife.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 24th reports that Liu Luyin has been residing in Hong Kong in recent years and only recently came to Shanghai. He once came to Beijing, but Mr. Liu was not seen attending the Third Plenary Session. Now, it is suddenly heard that he was arrested in Shanghai and has been handed over to the First Special District Court by the Public Concession Police. After much inquiry, reporters learned that Mr. Liu has secretly organized a reactionary group in recent years called the "Revolutionary Corps," with himself as the leader. He also established a "Chinese Youth Special Service Team," assigning party members to carry out assassination work in Beijing, Hubei, Shanghai, and other places. The expenses were allocated by Liu at a fixed amount of 2,000 yuan per month, managed by his confidant Xiao Runyun. He also deployed transportation personnel in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei provinces, and the Beijing-Shanghai area, with a monthly expense of 1,000 yuan. The targets were mainly in Beijing and Hubei. After the Yang Yongtai assassination case last year, the perpetrators Cheng Xiechao, Gong Baizhou, and key figures and accomplices such as Yang Qixin were successively arrested. They confessed that Yang Erqian was also involved, acting on Liu's orders in Wuhan, planning to kill Yang and then continue assassinating important party and state officials. Later, Yang Erqian's address in Shanghai was discovered. Detectives went to search for him, but Yang had already fled in fear of guilt. They kept watch at Yang's residence. Xiao Ruoxu came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, intending to meet Yang Erqian at Yang's residence, and was arrested by the guards. When questioned, Xiao said that he had met Xiao Runyun at Liu Luyin's residence in Hong Kong, who told him about the assassination of Yang Yongtai and asked him to go to Shanghai to personally instruct Yang Erqian to return to Hong Kong quickly because communication was too inconvenient. Xiao said that the assassination of Yang Yongtai was actually instigated by Liu Luyin. It is heard that the authorities in charge of this case plan to issue a public announcement to the people regarding Liu's reactionary organization, assassination plans, and related confessions. It is also heard that Liu is also suspected of being heavily involved in the Tang Youren assassination case.</p>

Its business scope included accepting deposits, handling remittances, buying and selling gold, silver, and securities, mortgage loans for movable and immovable property, guaranteed credit loans, operating agricultural warehouses, lending to agricultural and agricultural reclamation improvement projects, issuing agricultural bonds and agricultural circulating notes for farmers' cooperatives, and discounting agricultural bills. In 1935, it was renamed the Farmers Bank of China. On June 4 of the same year, the National Government promulgated the Farmers Bank of China Ordinance. In 1936, a savings department was added, and the Ministry of Finance approved the bank to issue banknotes for circulation in the same manner as legal tender and to handle land mortgage loans. Branches were established throughout the country. The chairman of the board is Kong Xiangxi, and the general manager is Xu Weizhuang.</p>
<p>Issuance Responsibility</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance stipulated the bank's issuance responsibility and issued a special notice for public knowledge, stating that the Farmers Bank of China was originally established to revive the rural economy. The Legislative Yuan previously resolved to grant the power to issue banknotes by promulgating regulations from the National Government. When legal tender was implemented the year before last, the Ministry immediately stipulated that the banknotes issued by the Farmers Bank of China should circulate in the same manner as legal tender in order to implement the revival of the rural economy. It ordered the bank to comply and reported it to the Executive Yuan for record. Now, the Ministry finds that since the bank's banknotes were previously stipulated to circulate in the same manner as legal tender, it should also bear foreign exchange responsibilities. All issuance reserve funds should be immediately handed over to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee for management in accordance with regulations, to consolidate the credit of legal tender. Special measures are stipulated below: 1. The banknotes issued by the Farmers Bank of China, which were previously stipulated to circulate in the same manner as legal tender, should immediately hand over their issuance reserve funds to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee for management in accordance with regulations. The amount of issuance and the amount of reserve funds should be inspected and announced monthly by the committee in accordance with the inspection rules. 2. Whether the Farmers Bank of China issues banknotes itself or receives them from other banks, it should handle them in accordance with the regulations of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee. 3. The Farmers Bank of China's foreign exchange reserves for issuing banknotes should be handled in consultation with the Central Bank. 4. The Farmers Bank of China's banknote issuance area should focus on important agricultural areas and border provinces. 5. The Farmers Bank of China should conscientiously handle rural mortgage loans and land mortgage loans in accordance with the regulations stipulated by the Ministry of Finance. In addition to reporting the above measures to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for record, and distributing them to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee, the Central Bank, and the Farmers Bank of China, the Ministry also issues a joint notice for public knowledge.

<h3>Estonian Nationals Celebrate National Day Yesterday</h3>
<p>The China Press reports that today (the 24th) is the National Day of the small Baltic country of Estonia. Estonian nationals around the world will hold celebrations. The country was ruled by Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Russia for about 800 years. During the European War, with the help of the British Navy and some Finnish volunteers, it won against Soviet Russia and declared independence on February 24, 1928. There are not many Estonian nationals in this city. At 6:00 PM tonight, they will gather at the residence of their representative in Shanghai, Mr. Lunberg, to hold a meeting to celebrate. This year, because the country's constitution is about to be changed in the near future, its nationals are particularly excited. Last October, the head of state, Mr. Pats, ordered the dissolution of parliament due to differences in political views and ordered the people to vote for a new parliament, which was established in January of this year. Its first task will be to draft a new constitution. Although the country is small in area, 60% of its people are engaged in agriculture, and the rest are half engaged in various industries and half are professionals, so there is no unemployment problem in the country. Its main agricultural exports are butter, cheese, pickles, eggs, hemp, etc., and the number of livestock transported to Soviet Russia every year is very large. The country is rich in forests, so there are more than 200 sawmills. Most of its timber is sold to the United States. Compulsory education has been implemented in the country, so the level of culture is very high. A large song festival is held every four years, with 1,600 singers and 80,000 to 100,000 listeners from all over the country.</p>

(4) The industry should request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to extract a 20% handling fee for the income tax withheld from deposit interest, so as to subsidize depositors and avoid evasion. It was decided to send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce immediately to submit the request on its behalf. (5) According to the notice from the Income Tax Affairs Office, stores should report their capital, etc. by the end of this month. How should this industry handle it?

<h3>Grain, Bean, and Rice Industries Jointly Sent a Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the Inclusion of Public Reserve Funds into Capital, Please Submit a Request to the Ministry of Finance for Clarification</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grain, Oil Cake, Bean, and Rice Industries Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday regarding the revision of the income tax issue, stating that the association raised reasons at the study session regarding the Regulations of the Income Tax Affairs. The association stated the points about Public Reserve Funds in accordance with the enforcement regulations of the provisional affairs which stated that; "(2) Those with public reserve funds may calculate one-third of the total amount into capital," and item 10 of the draft Collection Guidelines for Category I, "If the public reserve fund has reached one-half of the total capital, the public reserve fund drawn cannot be regarded as a legal public reserve fund," the meeting has been asked to adopt reason and resolution. The association asked to permit the public reserve fund of profit-making enterprises to be fully incorporated into capital, and to cancel the restriction that the public reserve fund reaching one-half of the capital cannot be regarded as a legal public reserve fund as they considered that would shake the foundation of the entire commercial industry. At the meeting, the congress voted and asked the council to ask the authorities to adopt it on a special project. It has been a month since the incident, but there has been no approval. The above two issues are of great importance to the subjects of taxpayers. Now, the Ministry of Finance announced that capital must be declared before the end of February. The deadline is approaching in an instant. The merchants of each industry are eager to have a clear expression on this issue. It is currently hoped to make it clear before the deadline of reporting. It is really a big question how to calculate and fill in the actual amount of business capital shares in the declaration form. It is feared that it will not be possible to report as scheduled. Therefore, the association is again sending a letter to the council, requesting it to ask the authorities to quickly and clearly announce the above issue, so that it can be followed. This is what the association prayed for.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Association Offers Rewards to Encourage Reporting of Smuggling</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Association, in view of the flooding of smuggled goods in recent years, which has damaged national taxes and disrupted the market, causing a great impact on legitimate silk, specially held a silk industry anti-smuggling meeting in September last year to assist the customs in handling anti-smuggling matters. Since then, the trend of smuggling has been greatly reduced. Now, the association believes that smugglers have many tricks and is concerned that there may be loopholes if it is not careful. Therefore, in addition to notifying members to hold a general inspection regularly, it has also published a notice in the newspaper that anyone who secretly deals in smuggled goods among the industry can report to the association or the customs. Once the investigation is confirmed, in addition to receiving the customs bonus, the association will award 300 yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Distributes Income Tax Declaration Forms</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the capital amount and deposits received by each business unit that should be reported have been published in Shanghai newspapers by the office's General Notice No. 5, and all are limited to filling out the forms and submitting them to the office for registration by the end of February. Now that the deadline is approaching, business units are coming to the office in an endless stream to obtain the aforementioned reporting forms, which shows that the council is leading the merchants and knowing how to follow the laws and support good taxes, which is deeply appreciated. For the convenience of business units, it is now sending 1,000 deposit reporting forms and 1,000 capital amount reporting forms. It is hoped that the council will receive them and separately notify each business unit to go to the council's distribution office to collect and fill out the forms. If there are not enough forms, please notify the office by telegram at any time, and the office will send someone to continue sending them. However, regarding the deadline for reporting various items, it is feared that each business unit is not very clear or is still waiting and seeing, resulting in the office being deeply concerned about the distant laws. It is planned to convene the heads of each trade association within this month for instructions. If necessary, the office can also send personnel to attend and participate, always with the goal of political and commercial harmony and unity, so as to avoid hindering each other. It is appropriate to send a letter to find out and deal with it, and it is hoped to see a reply for your efforts. The items related to this letter are that the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance has restricted all trade to declare their assets, and receipt of deposits by the end of February. All trades are reminded that they can obtain a declaration form from the commercial headquarters and return a completed form.</p>

<h3>A Returnee from Dalian Speaks</h3>
<p>Our reporter interviewed a friend who had just returned from Dalian yesterday. According to the friend, the commercial situation there has deteriorated drastically since the strict crackdown on smuggling in various places. Currently, most of the warehouses in Dalian are occupied by smuggled goods. Opium dens and gambling dens are everywhere in the city, and a group of unprincipled traitors are taking advantage of the situation, treating opium and gambling as sources of profit, and oppressing merchants in every possible way. Therefore, most merchants feel extremely miserable, and some have abandoned their businesses and returned home because they cannot bear the oppression. In addition, there is another matter that deserves attention: In April and May of this year, the puppet Manchukuo government planned to dredge the Yingkou Port in the Bohai Bay, and the engineering plan was ready. However, it was estimated that there would not be enough workers, so it was planned to recruit workers from various places. All procedures were handled by a company in Qingdao, with a limit of 3,000 recruits. In addition to issuing permits, fourth-class boat tickets would also be provided. It is said that this is currently being planned in secret. It is hoped that the authorities in various places will pay attention to this and that the people of the country will be self-respecting and not be tempted by profit.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Ship Post Office Issue</h3>
<p>Report from the Japanese Embassy in China</p>
<p>Shanghai, 24th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Ministry of Communications has established post offices on the Sino-Japanese liaison ships Shanghai Maru and Nagasaki Maru in order to benefit passengers and expedite postal affairs between the two countries. However, it seems that the Chinese side has various misunderstandings about this. Therefore, the Japanese Embassy in China issued the following statement today regarding this matter: "The post offices established on the Shanghai Maru and Nagasaki Maru are the same as those established on ships on the North American routes. Mail deposited on the ships will be sorted during the voyage. Therefore, in addition to expediting mail delivery between the two countries, it is also intended to benefit passengers. The post office windows will only be open during the voyage, and the post offices will be closed when the ships are docked in Shanghai. Therefore, the sale of stamps is out of the question, and even ten-packet bundles cannot be accepted. This is very clear. Moreover, mail accepted on the ships must have Republic of China stamps affixed. If Japanese stamps are mistakenly affixed without Republic of China stamps, it will be treated as underpaid postage. Therefore, the postal rights of the Republic of China have not been infringed."</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Zhang's Residence Burglarized, Losses Not Severe</h3>

<h3>The Municipal Government's Protest Against the Shanghai Grand Theatre Case; Italian Consul to Reply This Morning</h3>
<p>Originally scheduled for yesterday morning, postponed due to careful consideration</p>
<p>New Sound News Agency: Regarding the case of Italian sailors vandalizing the Shanghai Grand Theatre, after the Municipal Government lodged a protest with the Italian Consul General's Office in Shanghai, the Italian Consulate had already drafted a reply, which was scheduled to be delivered yesterday morning. However, as of 5:00 PM yesterday, after the Municipal Government's office hours, the Municipal Government had not yet received the reply. A reporter then inquired with Italian Vice-Consul Macauli, who revealed that the reply had been postponed to this morning due to the need for careful consideration.</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that the Italian authorities in Shanghai will reply tomorrow (the 25th) to the Shanghai Municipal Government's protest against the Italian sailors' vandalism of the Shanghai Grand Theatre last Saturday. However, the Italian Consul General in Shanghai and the Italian naval authorities are still maintaining strict silence regarding this case. The Italian Embassy has not yet responded to the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs' protest. Furthermore, the case of the clash between British and Italian soldiers on Zhu Baosan Road in the French Concession on Sunday night is still under investigation by the authorities. The British and Italian authorities are still prohibiting their soldiers from entering the dance halls in that area to prevent further conflicts.</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that the owner of the Shanghai Grand Theatre, a Russian expatriate, in addition to collecting evidence regarding the riot on Saturday, has requested the Soviet Russian Consul General in Shanghai to lodge a protest with the local Italian authorities. The Soviet Russian authorities hope to resolve this case in a reasonable manner to avoid further escalation of the situation. Furthermore, the two British soldiers injured in the clash on Zhu Baosan Road on Sunday night were not as seriously injured as initially reported. It is reported that they will return to the military hospital. Although British and Italian soldiers are still prohibited from going to Zhu Baosan Road for entertainment, the British soldiers are not confined to their barracks. As for the truth of the case, the relevant authorities will only issue a statement after the details have been clarified.</p>

On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at around 3 PM, he secretly went to the address with a foreign detective and arrested the main offender, Madam Dong Yue, a woman from Jiaxing.

<h3>Zhang Shou Peng Reopens a Two-Year-Old Murder Case</h3>
<p>Xinbao Dies Unable to Bear Her Husband's Oppression; Prosecutor Considers This Case Strange, Awaiting Review</p>
<p>Zhang Shou Peng, a 44-year-old man from Yancheng, lived at No. 281 Hengtong Road in Zhabei. His daughter, Xinbao, was 18 years old and had married Zang Daqian, who ran the Shiyuan Teahouse at No. 1371 Guangfu Road, at the age of 15. However, due to her husband's violent nature, their marriage was unhappy. During the New Year two years ago, Xinbao wanted to return to her parents' home for the New Year's celebrations, but Zang resented his in-laws and refused to allow her to go. Xinbao still returned to her mother's home after her husband left. Zang found out when he returned home and was furious that his wife had disobeyed him. He exercised his rights as a husband and rushed over that night to bring his wife back. He beat her with his fists. As a result, the couple's relationship deteriorated further. On September 2nd, Xinbao, unable to bear her husband's oppression, committed suicide by hanging herself. The case was reported to the local court, which sent Prosecutor Li Fen to examine and collect the body. Nearly two years later, Zhang Shou Peng recently reopened the case, stating that his daughter was forced to return home late at night when she was prevented from visiting her parents' home for the New Year's celebrations two years ago. She was pressed onto the bed, her head covered with a quilt, her body straddled, and beaten with leather shoes, leaving her body covered in injuries. At that time, the teahouse customers had not yet left, and Wang Dechao and Chen Xiaoerzi, among others, rescued her. From then on, the abuse increased, forcing her to commit suicide. Therefore, his daughter's death can be said to be a result of the beatings and the hanging, and that she would not have died if she had not been beaten and hanged. He said that the initial examination was obscured by the deception and requested that Wang Dechao and Chen Xiaoerzi be called as witnesses and a re-examination be conducted. After the prosecutor questioned them, he considered the case to be strange and to have other intentions, so he decided to wait for further investigation.</p>

<h3>The Little Kidnap Victim Returns Safely</h3>
<p>The Kidnappers Have Been Caught; Trial Today</p>
<p>Yang Rongfu, the owner of the Dachang Porcelain Shop at No. 130 Kai Zi Er Road in the French Concession, a native of Wuxi, had a six-year-old son named Huiqi, who disappeared suddenly on the morning of the 17th of last month while playing at the entrance of the alley next to the shop. After searching in vain, the family received a threatening letter from the kidnappers by mail, demanding 2,000 gold pieces for ransom and specifying a location for negotiations. Yang then realized that his beloved son had been kidnapped and prepared the money to go to the appointed location on time, but no one from the kidnappers met him. Later, Zhang Yunqing, a tailor and fellow townsman of Yang, pretending to be a kidnapper, wrote a letter to Yang, enticing him to negotiate the ransom at the Southeast Inn at the entrance of Ruifu Lane on East Zilai Yan Street. After receiving the letter, Yang reported it to the French Police Station, which sent detectives disguised as waiters and travelers to wait at the Southeast Inn. Zhang was arrested and interrogated. Zhang confessed that he was impersonating a kidnapper in an attempt to swindle money from the victim. He was sent to the court for interrogation. At the same time, the detectives conducted a thorough investigation and arrested the kidnappers Cai Fuxing (the victim's driver), Wu Jinshu, Chen Shouming, Shi Dexing, and four other people. They were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation.

<h3>Revisions to the Freight Rates for Livestock Transport on Two Railways Will Be Implemented Next Month</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus previously had special prices for transporting yellow cattle, water buffalo, and large pigs. However, due to the additional 10% surcharge, the calculation was particularly complicated. In order to facilitate calculation, the Office of General Affairs has calculated the actual transportation cost and surcharge for these livestock special prices and revised the discount rates accordingly, without charging additional surcharges. This has been submitted to the Ministry of Railways and approved, and will be implemented starting next month. The revised freight rates are listed below: ① Water buffalo on the Beijing-Shanghai Line: 62% discount from 2 cents per head per kilometer; yellow cattle on the Beijing-Shanghai Line: 47% discount from 2 cents per head per kilometer; ② Yellow cattle or water buffalo from Zhakou, Nanxingqiao, Gongchenqiao to Wangdian, Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Weijing: 1.1 cents per head per kilometer. If the origin and destination are not within the designated stations above, it is 1.8 cents per head per kilometer. On the Cao-Yong section, it is 1.8 cents per head per kilometer; ③ Large pigs from Jiangbian, Nanjing to Nanxingqiao and Zhakou in Hang, West Hill Gate: 1 yuan and 8 cents per head; from Wuxi to Nanxingqiao and West Hill Gate in Hang: 72 cents per head; from Zhenjiang West Station and Ben Niu to Nanxingqiao, West Hill Gate, Gongchenqiao, and Zhakou in Hangzhou: 90 cents per head; on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line (excluding the Cao-Yong section), 40% discount from 5 li per head per kilometer; on the Gong-Zha branch line, 15 cents per head.

<h3>A Human Head and Half a Chest Were Found on a Coal Ash Heap at Xinqiao Tou</h3>
<p>A Coal-Picking Laborer Opened It with a Bamboo Hook; Report to the Authorities for Examination to Determine the Cause</p>
<p>On the coal ash heap in the open space opposite No. 400 Xinqiao Tou on the south side of Shanghai (i.e., west of Lujiabang Road), at around 7 AM yesterday, a coal-picking laborer from Jiangbei was picking up coal ash when he suddenly noticed an old white undershirt wrapped around something. Suspecting that it was an unexpected gain, he opened it with a bamboo hook, only to discover that it was shockingly the head of a victim, along with half of his chest. The rest of the torso, lower body, and limbs had all been cut off without a trace. The head and face had been shaved and stabbed with a knife, and the flesh was a bloody mess. The appearance was extremely gruesome, and it was impossible to distinguish whether the victim was male or female. Everyone was frightened and fled. Later, passersby gathered to watch. Pan Bingyao, the police officer on duty, reported it to the police station for a thorough investigation to clarify the facts and bring the perpetrators to justice. He also summoned Bao Yang Wenxiang to report it to the local court, which will send personnel to the scene for examination today.

<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Plans a Budget Procedure</h3>
<p>The draft budgets of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Works Department, Education Department, and other departments were published in the newspapers a few days ago. Readers may have thought that these draft budgets had already been approved by the board of directors. In fact, this is not the case. According to the Council's proposed budget procedure, each draft must first be discussed by the director of the department concerned and the director of the Finance Department. The director of the Finance Department will sign and comment on it and submit it to the responsible committee. After the committee considers it, it will submit its recommendations to the board of directors for approval and allow the Finance Committee to review it. After the Finance Committee has compiled all the draft budgets from each department, it will consider them comprehensively. Before the draft is submitted to the board of directors for final approval, the director of the Finance Department must consult with the directors of the other departments and the Finance Committee must revise it again. The draft budget now submitted to the board of directors has only gone through the preliminary procedure. The purpose is to allow the directors to understand the views of the responsible committee on a particular plan and to allow the directors to express their preliminary views for the Finance Committee to consider.</p>

<h3>Lantern Festival Tide on Huangpu River Extraordinarily High Today</h3>
<p>Reaching Over Eleven Feet</p>
<p>Occurring Around Midnight</p>
<p>The Datong News Agency reports that heavy fog has plagued the city for several days, significantly impacting transportation. The day before yesterday, heavy rain poured down, continuing intermittently into the night. Yesterday morning, although the rain was sparse,</p>
<p>the sky remained overcast</p>
<p>and extremely gloomy. The north wind blew frequently, causing a sharp drop in temperature, and the atmospheric pressure was very low. Therefore, continuous rain is likely, and there is no hope for clear skies in the near future. This year's rainfall has already been ample, and if the drizzle continues, the spring flowers will inevitably lose their luster. According to the Shanghai Dredging Bureau's prediction, a high tide will occur in the Huangpu River today (the 25th). Such a large tide is rare during the spring and winter seasons, and therefore warrants close attention. The bureau's measurements for</p>
<p>today's tide</p>
<p>are as follows: the tide will begin to rise at 11:15 AM, and the rate of increase will suddenly become rapid at 12:02 PM. At that time, the current speed will be approximately 1.9 nautical miles per hour. The tide will reach its peak at 12:40 PM, with a height of approximately 11 feet 5 inches (the height of the Bund embankment is 13 feet), very close to the riverbank. The tide will begin to recede at approximately 3:20 PM and will be completely gone after 9:00 PM. When the tide is at its peak, the low-lying area of Ma Road may be flooded.</p>

<h3>Italian Impersonating Detective Surrenders After Intimidation and Extortion</h3>
<p>Voluntarily Reports to Italian Consulate, But Denies Extortion. Chinese National Shen Xinglu Sentenced to Two Years and Six Months.</p>
<p>Shi Huanzhang, a compradore in the insurance department of the Taikoo Steamship Company, residing at No. 8 Fanshe Lane, Mu'erming Road, was visited by a Westerner and four Chinese on the 17th of this month at 3:30 PM. Impersonating Chinese and Western detectives from the police, they used the pretext of searching for opium to extort 400 yuan. Afterwards, Shi reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which arrested Yong native Shen Xinglu, and suspects Li Jiren and the woman Shen Lao Si. The three were sent to the First Court. After investigation, it was determined that Shen Lao Si was not involved and she was</p>
<p>released first.</p>
<p>The situation of Shen and Li being detained again has been recorded in this newspaper and is being rescheduled. The Italian, Contini, who impersonated a Western detective, was also arrested by the police and sent to the Italian Consulate for interrogation. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng continued the trial of this case at the Eighth Criminal Court. First, Police Attorney Li Zhishan stated that during the rescheduling, it was found that the defendant Li Jiren was also not involved and requested permission to discontinue his detention. Judge Huang approved Li's release. The attorney then continued, stating that</p>
<p>after this case occurred</p>
<p>, Chinese Detective Tang Jian of the Jing'an Temple Police Station discovered that the person impersonating the Western detective was related to the Italian Contini. After detailed questioning of the suspect Shen Xinglu, it was indeed found to be Contini's doing. In addition to Shen himself, there were other accomplices Du Tianzeng, Wang Liqun, and Shao Laoyi, who are currently at large. While the police were in the process of arresting Contini, Contini had already heard about it and surrendered himself to the</p>
<p>Italian Consulate.</p>
<p>After interrogation, it was learned that Contini was a special patrolman No. 95 of the Public Concession Police, with police credentials. Three months ago, he met the defendant Shen Xinglu and Shao Laoyi at the office of Attorney Shi Jiutang on the fifth floor of No. 35 Beijing Road. Shen and Shao were both working at Attorney Shi's office. Attorney Shi used Contini's Western status, believing that he would be more effective than a Chinese person in cases such as representing debt recovery, and thus hired Contini as a collection agent. Contini also</p>
<p>operated a wine business</p>
<p>and entrusted the defendant to sell his wine. Therefore, they traveled back and forth frequently. This year, during the Lunar New Year, the defendant went to Shao Laoyi's house at No. 3 Yongle Xing, Kaizi'er Road, in the French Concession to pay his respects. They discussed that a wealthy family on Mu'erming Road had a large sum of money and smokers, so it would be possible to extort them. Thus, Contini, Shen Xinglu, and the fugitives Shao, Du, and Wang went to Shi Huanzhang's house at No. 8 Fanshe Lane. Shao first knocked on the door and entered, impersonating Chinese and Western detectives, and sent the defendant to the side of the staircase to</p>
<p>monitor the telephone</p>
<p>to prevent information from leaking. They began searching and then discovered that Shi's wife's aunt, Chen Shenmin, was smoking. They then used this as an excuse to extort money, initially demanding over a thousand yuan, and eventually receiving four hundred yuan before leaving. During interrogation at the Italian Consulate, Contini only admitted to going to collect a debt and denied impersonating a detective and extorting money. The police are prosecuting the defendant not only for extortion under Article 346 of the criminal code but also</p>
<p>adding Article</p>
<p>158 of the criminal code for impersonating a public official. The witness Chen Suzhen testified that Shi Huanzhang is my sister's husband. That day, a Westerner and four Chinese came, claiming to be detectives sent by the police to search for opium. The defendant Shen Xinglu even went upstairs. While I was talking, my aunt had already begun negotiating the price with Shao Pangyi. Shao initially demanded over a thousand yuan, otherwise, he would take me and my aunt to the police station in the large car. My aunt was afraid and ordered me to take out 400 yuan and give it to them before they left. When questioned, the defendant admitted that he</p>
<p>went with Contini</p>
<p>, Shao Laoyi, Du Tianzeng, and Wang Liqun and stood by the staircase, but he did not know about the extortion and did not receive any money. Judge Huang reviewed the confession and sentenced Shen Xinglu to two years and six months in prison for jointly using intimidation to cause a person to hand over their property, and fined him 400 yuan as a warning. The Italian Consulate will try Contini.</p>
<h3>Merchant Ship Accident in Heavy Fog</h3>
<p>Nan Jin Maru Sinks</p>
<p>Victory Escapes Reef Unscathed</p>
<p>The Victory, owned by the Zhengji Company, weighing 3,087 tons, 297 feet 5 inches long, 18 feet deep, and 40 feet 1 inch wide, with a draft of 19 feet 8 inches, was carrying cargo to Nanhua. The company received a telegram from its shipowner yesterday, stating that the Victory had encountered heavy fog near the Ninepins off the coast of Hong Kong, causing the ship to run aground on a reef. However, it automatically escaped the reef during high tide and sailed to Hong Kong. Due to the heavy fog at sea, it was unable to navigate and temporarily dropped anchor. It will enter Hong Kong after the fog clears for inspection.</p>
<p>Min Gui Barge Collision</p>
<p>The Min Gui, owned by the Minsheng Industrial Company, was carrying goods from Yichang to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, near the No. 1 River Tube outside the Wusong estuary, a large tugboat owned by the Taikoo Company was sailing from Shanghai to the Wusong estuary. Due to the heavy fog, the two ships could not see each other in advance and collided when they were close. The iron plates of the Min Gui were damaged, and the hull of the barge was also damaged. After the accident, both ships sailed to Shanghai. A surveyor will inspect the damage before repairs are made.</p>
<p>Yoshida Maru Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The No. 1 Yoshida Maru, owned by the Yamashita Steamship Company of this port, which collided with the No. 23 Nanjin Maru in heavy fog off the coast of Wenzhou, occurred at 7:00 AM on the 23rd. The two ships were sailing in heavy fog when they collided. The hull of the Nanjin Maru immediately cracked and took on water, drifting on the sea. After the collision, the Yoshida Maru could still sail because the external damage was not serious. The crew of the Nanjin Maru was rescued by the Yoshida Maru, but three people went missing. The Nanjin Maru has now completely sunk. The Yoshida Maru arrived in Wusong at 10:00 AM yesterday to report the accident to the Yamashita Company. The ship anchored in Wusong and did not enter the port. The Yamashita Company immediately sent personnel to the ship to investigate the truth of the matter because its destination was not Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Goods Company Embezzles Checks and Withdraws Large Sums of Money</h3>
<p>Shopping, Making Clothes, and Repaying Debts; Surplus Funds Deposited in the Bank</p>
<p>Shu Shunfu, a Ningbo native working as a clerk at the Tonghe Miscellaneous Goods Company located at 217 Wuchang Road, secretly stole three blank checks from the company between January 6th and January 1st of this year. He affixed forged seals to them and subsequently had people withdraw funds from the Shanghai Wing On Hongwai Branch on North Sichuan Road. He embezzled a total of 922.30 yuan, which he spent before fleeing back to his home at 47 Yangmiao Front, Zhenhai South Gate in Ningbo. The case was reported to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched Detective Fang Fucheng, armed with an official letter from the First Special District Court, to apprehend Shu at his address in coordination with the local police station. Shu was arrested and brought to Shanghai on the day before yesterday, where he was detained in the police station. A gold ring worth 28 yuan, a watch, and 5 yuan in national currency were found on his person. Yesterday morning, he was transferred to the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that the defendant confessed to the police that he had first used a check on December 26th of last year, through a friend named A Xiang, to withdraw 211.30 yuan. On January 8th of this year, he used two checks to withdraw 311 yuan and 400 yuan, all of which were collected by Chen from the Wing On Branch. He then fled back to Zhenhai on the 31st, having already spent 420 yuan on purchasing miscellaneous goods, making clothes, and repaying debts. The remaining 500 yuan was deposited in the Shanghai Savings Branch Bank at Xiaodongmen in this city, but the passbook was left at his home in Zhenhai. He therefore requested an extension to obtain proof from Wu Huanan, the Cantonese manager of Tonghe Miscellaneous Goods Company, regarding the defendant's withdrawal of funds. After Judge Pan Zhenyang questioned Shu, he admitted his guilt without reservation. The judge ordered him to remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Unification and Peace (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>㊅</p>
<p>Since we must exert the strength of the entire nation to achieve true unification, and then, when necessary, launch a comprehensive war of resistance against the enemy, our current problem is simply how to achieve unification? I have said before that unification can sometimes be achieved through war and sometimes through peaceful means. Since the September 18th Incident in 1931, because of the severity of the national crisis and the looming threat of a powerful enemy, the central government has always tried to achieve unification through peaceful means within the realm of possibility. However, relying solely on the government to seek unification through peaceful means is certainly not enough. Simply allowing the central government to request the remnants of warlords, begging them not to secede, is like seeking skin from a tiger. There must be the strength of the people as a backing to achieve unification through peaceful means. If the people do not use their strength to help the government seek unification through peaceful means, then in the inevitable moment, military force will still be required in the future. So, what peaceful methods can the people use to help the central government eliminate separatist forces and complete unification? To address this point, it is first necessary to understand that the obstacle to unification lies in the military system. Therefore, if it is possible to preserve the army while dissolving the system, then separatist forces will inevitably be eliminated without a single shot fired, and peaceful unification will be achieved.</p>
<p>What does it mean to preserve the army while dissolving the system? For example, in the Xi'an Incident, Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng alone could not have seceded. They relied on the military system to perform the trick of secession. Zhang Xueliang believed that the Northeast Army was his system, and Yang Hucheng believed that the Shaanxi Army was his system, so they dared to dream such a foolish dream of secession. Even Zhu De and Mao Zedong of the Communist Party believed that the "Red Army" was their system, so they fled from their old nest in Jiangxi to the border of Shaanxi and Gansu, still wanting to secede. Now our policy of peaceful unification is nothing more than preserving the army and dissolving the system. If the soldiers in the army ultimately refuse to betray the revolution and become bandits, but instead turn back and listen to the command of the central government, then the army must naturally be preserved; otherwise, eliminating 10,000 soldiers means losing 10,000 units of strength against foreign enemies. However, while the army is preserved, its system must be absolutely dissolved. We must not allow the so-called Northeast Army, Shaanxi Army... or even the so-called "Red Army" system of the Communist bandits to continue to exist. An army with an unbreakable system is entirely the idea of feudal warlords, an idea against unification. We should now only have the National Army of the Republic of China, not provincial armies, and only the National Revolutionary Army, with no further permission for the existence of the "Red Army." Once the military system is dissolved, the warlords will have no way to secede.</p>
<p>How to dissolve the military system? First, local politics should be completely separated from the military. The military must not interfere in local politics: all major powers such as military affairs, diplomacy, finance, and civil administration should be completely concentrated in the central government, and the military must not divide the central government's governing power. Second, the army should be separated from its stationed location. In a modern country, it has never been heard of that someone's army must be stationed in a certain place, and any attempt to move it will be met with resistance. Yet a portion of the Chinese army is like this. Can this still be considered the national army? Therefore, to ensure that the army does not have a fixed connection with its stationed location and can be transferred at any time, this is the way to resist enemies and to respect the central government and be loyal to the country. Third, the army should not have an absolute relationship with its commanding generals. If a certain division is assigned to a certain general as the division commander today, then the previous division commander should hand over the seals of office. This is how an army becomes the national army, and no longer the personal army of the division commander. Only when these three points are fully achieved can the forces of secession be considered eliminated through peaceful means. However, achieving these three points will certainly require the full power of the people. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>After Receiving Goods, Zhang Chuan Uses套 to Emerge from the Three-Month Yarn Drop Breaking Through the 40 Yuan Barrier</p>
<p>Current Sales are Not Strong, and Third-Grade Products are Falling; Speculators are Panicked and the Downward Trend is Fierce</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to be sluggish, and the downward trend is becoming more intense. The weak situation is due to the active preparations for delivery in the February period, further dampening sentiment. According to market sources, some of the yarn received by the long positions has been used by 標紗 to套 emerge from the market, and some have been closed out. This rumor has spread, causing speculators to panic and the market to trend downward. The three-month contract has broken through the 40 yuan barrier, allowing some short positions to profit and offset losses.</p>
<p>All Months Drop by More Than Two Yuan</p>
<p>The 標紗 market opened with the three-month contract slightly up by 0.4 yuan, but as it approached the distant month, it tended to decline. This was because the warehouse had sufficient yarn inventory, and the industry expected prices to fall. As a result, the market loosened, and the downward trend intensified. In the second round of trading, the current month plummeted by 1.8 yuan, pulling the distant months into the whirlpool. Gengfeng, a long position, painfully closed out 7,000 bales, while Weirui, Dahexing, and Changfeng, short positions, profited and covered their positions. By the third closing, the price had rebounded by a few cents. The final result was that each month's price fell by 0.7-1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw a slight rebound of a few cents due to profit-taking from the morning. However, after the opening, rumors spread that long positions were closing out and selling, while the prices of third-grade yarns slightly rebounded. Current sales were not strong, and the downward trend intensified until the closing, with the three-month contract breaking through the 40 yuan barrier. As a result, each month's price fell again by 1.39 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. It was found that Taixing sold 3,200 bales, leaving 900 bales remaining; Tongji 1,100 bales; Juxing 1,100 bales; Jinchang 2,550 bales; Gengfeng 7,000 bales; Xingchang 1,200 bales; Yuanyi 3,190 bales; Runkang 2,150 bales; and Fengtai 850 bales. Mingde bought 2,100 bales; Hengyi 3,450 bales; Changji 1,000 bales; and Hexing 2,700 bales. The highest and lowest prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Prices Also Fall; Spot Yarn Sales Are Average</p>
<p>It was found that various groups purchased a total of 943 bales throughout the day, and the selling prices fell by 1-3 yuan. The purchase amounts of each group are listed below.</p>

<h3>Han Xin</h3>
<p>— Lu Minggao</p>
<p>—Self-Reliance is the Foundation of Personal Success—</p>
<p>"Mom, Uncle Xin hasn't come for several days..." The child said, holding his rice bowl in both hands and tilting his head to look at his mother.</p>
<p>"He's only been gone for one day, and you miss him so much!" The mother said unhappily, then put a piece of meat in the child's bowl, "Come on, he gobbles everything up, eats a lot, and always picks the best parts. If he comes, will there still be any meat left for your little mouth?"</p>
<p>The child didn't say anything after hearing his mother's words, but he didn't agree with her at all. He remembered that Uncle Xin never ate more than him when he came to eat, and he always gave him the best parts. He didn't understand why his mother was so annoyed by Uncle Xin.</p>
<p>After dinner, the mother was weaving cloth in the hall, and the child was flying a kite in the yard. The string was short, and the kite was small, so it wouldn't fly. The child was getting anxious when someone knocked on the door, but he was too lazy to open it.</p>
<p>"Long'er, what's wrong? Why don't you go open the door! Maybe Dad is back with a big kite."</p>
<p>Long'er heard his mother's words and quickly jumped up to open the door. It turned out that it wasn't anyone else, it was Uncle Xin.</p>
<p>Han Xin was a little different today! He was wearing a new hat and a new sword, and he walked in proudly. His face was red, obviously he had been drinking a lot of wine. Long'er carried Han Xin's sword and hugged him into the hall, saying as they walked:</p>
<p>"Uncle Xin, where did you get this sword? It looks like my dad's - have you eaten yet? We're having boiled sheep's head today."</p>
<p>Xin smiled without saying a word, and went forward to bow to the woman weaving cloth at the loom:</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law Huang, Brother Huang asked me to tell you that there's something going on at the pavilion today, and he doesn't have time to come back."</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Huang didn't get off the loom, but stopped her work, twisted her body, and looked Xin up and down, then said half-complimenting and half-mocking:</p>
<p>"Han Dalang, congratulations, you must have become an official! A tall hat, a long sword, and both of them are new, so majestic!"</p>
<p>Xin felt embarrassed and couldn't say anything. Long'er saw that it wasn't his dad bringing back a big kite, and he didn't find the adults' conversation interesting, so he quietly slipped back into the yard. After a while, Xin finally said, blushing:</p>
<p>"Isn't this all Brother Huang's doing? This morning he came to the inn to find me and said, 'Brother Xin, I don't think I've offended you in any way, why did you run away in a fit of pique?' I said, 'How dare I be angry? It's just that I've been eating off you for so long, Brother, and I haven't made any progress in repaying your kindness. I feel ashamed, so I have no face to stay any longer. I'm already a young man who's fully twenty years old, not a child anymore, so how can I still rely on others and not seek self-reliance?' Unexpectedly, as soon as Brother heard me say I was twenty years old, he grabbed me and said, 'Brother Xin, there's no need to talk about the past. From today on, you'll still come back to my house, and I'll treat you like my own brother. It's rare that you're twenty years old this year. Twenty is when a man comes of age, it's a major event in life, and today is a good day, so let me perform the coming-of-age ceremony for you.' Brother didn't let me explain, but bought a new hat for me to wear and invited some friends to drink a few celebratory drinks at the tavern. Before leaving, Brother also said that my sword was too short and old, and didn't look good, so he insisted on swapping it with his."</p>
<p>"So that's how it is, you've taken advantage of your brother," Sister-in-law Huang immediately turned her face, "But this sword is what I saved money to buy for him, please give it back to me, buy yourself another one! You've been away from us for a few days, and it's said that you've had great luck, so you wouldn't care about this little bit of money."</p>
<p>She was forcing Xin to take off the sword, while yelling loudly outside:</p>
<p>"Long'er, open the door for Uncle Xin to go out and buy a sword, he also promised to buy you a big kite."</p>
<p>Xin helplessly walked away with heavy steps. The somewhat sensible Long'er was still gesturing behind him, loudly urging:</p>
<p>"Uncle Xin, the kite must be at least this big, small ones can't fly. It would be best if you bought me a bundle of string too."</p>
<p>He watched Han Xin go far away, then closed the door, thinking: "As long as I have a big kite. It doesn't matter if I don't buy string, I can steal the yarn my mother uses to weave cloth to make string." He suddenly remembered how he had been caught by his mother yesterday for stealing yarn and had his thigh bruised, and he couldn't help reaching out to touch the scar, and tears welled up. He thought again: "It would be better if Uncle Xin bought the string too."</p>
<p>Before dinner, Xin came back. He had a newly bought sword on his waist, but his hands were empty, with neither a kite nor string. Long'er knew that he had been deceived, and cried for a kite, refusing to eat. Sister-in-law Huang also got angry and beat Long'er again. She whipped her son, scolding Han Xin in her mouth:</p>
<p>"Don't say anything, haven't you been eating for free in our house for two or three years? Buying a kite for the child can't even be considered repaying kindness. Who knew that 'a pint of rice raises a grateful person, a bushel of rice raises an enemy'? You have money to buy a sword, but no money to buy a kite?" She suddenly put down her hand and stopped hitting the child, changing her tone, "Useless child, you've mistaken a good person! You want a kite! You should ask your dad, how can you..."</p>
<p>Before she could finish speaking, someone suddenly pushed open the door and walked in. It was an apprentice swordsmith. He saw Sister-in-law Huang's face at this moment and was very afraid. He said in a flustered manner:</p>
<p>"Please forgive my impoliteness! I knocked on the door for a long time, but no one came to open it. It turned out that the door was ajar, and it opened with a gentle push."</p>
<p>"What are you saying? You're not making sense. Just tell me, what are you here for?"</p>
<p>The apprentice didn't know what to say, now that she was urging him. He breathed a few times and then looked at the restless Han Xin and said:</p>
<p>"I'm looking for Han Dalang to talk!"</p>
<p>"What's so secretive? You have to make it clear here." She stood up and blocked the doorway of the hall, afraid that the visitor would leave.</p>
<p>"My master wasn't home today, so I took the liberty of selling a sword to Han Dalang on credit. Just now, my master came back and said that Han Dalang is a poor person who wouldn't have money to buy a sword, and he wanted me to come back immediately to get the sword back."</p>
<p>Han Xin stood aside, his face turning from blue to purple, extremely embarrassed! He couldn't explain himself, so he quietly took off the sword and let the apprentice carry it back. He was too embarrassed to stay any longer, so he made an excuse, left without even eating dinner. When it was time for breakfast, he cheekily came to Huang's house again. Unexpectedly, he waited until noon and still didn't see any food served, which he found strange. He gave Long'er a look, calling him out, and secretly asked him:</p>
<p>"Why isn't dinner being served so late today? Aren't you hungry?"</p>
<p>"Uncle Xin, let me tell you, but don't let Mom know I told you."</p>
<p>"Of course, tell me quickly!" Han Xin was eager to know what was going on.</p>
<p>"Mom woke me up very early today, and she said, 'Long'er, get up and eat quickly, Uncle Xin is coming soon.' I thought I had slept past the time and it was already time for breakfast. After I finished washing up, it was strange that Mom brought the meal to the bed to eat. I said, 'The bed is too small, how will there be enough room for Uncle Xin to sit?' Mom smiled and said, 'You're still a child and don't understand. This isn't a place to invite Uncle Xin to eat. We're moving the meal here to mean that we don't want Uncle Xin to have any. When he comes later, don't tell him we've already eaten. Let him starve to death so he won't dare to come to our door again.' I'm afraid of Mom, so I didn't dare to speak up for you. As soon as I finished eating, I ran out to play."</p>
<p>Han Xin heard Long'er's words and knew that Sister-in-law Huang was determined to cut him off, so he was very angry. He endured his hunger and left without even saying goodbye to Huang, the head of the pavilion. Sister-in-law Huang also said many bad things about Han Xin to her husband, causing Huang to also hate Han Xin and no longer ask him to come back.</p>
<p>Han Xin couldn't make a living, so he went fishing outside the city. One day, there were many women washing cotton in the pond. They saw that Han Xin was so hungry that he could barely lift his fishing rod, and they all laughed at him for being useless. Only an old washerwoman pitied him and gave him food. She washed cotton for dozens of days and provided for Han Xin for dozens of days. Finally, Han Xin gratefully said to the washerwoman:</p>
<p>"I will definitely repay you greatly in the future."</p>
<p>"A great man who cannot feed himself is the most shameful thing in the world. I only give you food because I pity you, I don't expect you to repay me. Strive for self-reliance, begging and relying on others is not the behavior of a great man." The washerwoman sternly reprimanded Xin, which couldn't help but make him realize his mistake. From then on, he worked hard to be a better person, studying diligently and striving for goodness. Soon he became a scholar of great learning. But people at the time didn't understand him. One day, he was passing through the market in Huaiyin, and a group of hooligan youths wanted to humiliate him. The leader of the group said: "Although you are tall and big and like to carry a knife and sword, you are actually very scared inside." He spread his legs and made a riding gesture, then patted his chest and said to Xin: "If you are a brave person, please draw your knife and stab me to death, otherwise you have to crawl out from under my crotch."</p>
<p>Han Xin knew that his future was bright and didn't want to sacrifice himself for a pointless argument. He stared at that person for a while, then bent down, lowered his head, and crawled out from under the person's crotch. The people in the market laughed, saying that Han Xin was cowardly and useless.</p>
<p>Soon, the Qin Dynasty fell, and the world was in chaos. The heroes rose up one after another. The Chu general Xiang Liang crossed the Huai River, and Han Xin followed him with his sword. Liang didn't know that Xin was a virtuous man and didn't know how to use him properly. When Liang died, Xin followed Liang's nephew, Yu, who made him a courtier. Xin repeatedly proposed strategies for Yu, but Yu didn't use them. Later, when Emperor Gaozu of Han entered Shu, Xin fled from Chu and returned to Han. But he was still just a small official, and no one knew who he was. One day, a group of people committed crimes and were to be executed. Unfortunately, Xin was also among them. When they were taken to the execution ground, Xin thought he was doomed, closed his eyes, and waited for the knife to fall. One person was killed with each chop, and thirteen people were killed. When it was Xin's turn, Xin couldn't help but look up and see that the executioner was Teng Gong. In a moment of desperation, Xin asked: "Does the King of Han not want to conquer the world? Why execute brave men?"</p>
<p>Teng Gong saw that Xin looked heroic and could say such bold words, so he spared him from execution. Teng Gong talked to Xin and knew that he was an extraordinary person, and he liked him very much, recommending him to Gaozu. Gaozu made him the Grain Storekeeper, but he didn't appreciate him very much.</p>
<p>Xin talked to Prime Minister Xiao He several times, and He admired him very much. At that time, Xiang Yu's power was strong, and Gaozu's power was weak. Some generals didn't believe that Gaozu would succeed, and when they came to Nanzheng, dozens of them fled halfway. Xin saw that many people were leaving, and he couldn't help but feel moved, thinking:</p>
<p>"He must have introduced me to the King of Han many times. Today he still doesn't use me, and I can know that in the future, I might as well leave too."</p>
<p>The news of Xin's escape reached He, who didn't have time to report to Gaozu, so he personally ran to chase Xin. Gaozu didn't know the truth and was very angry when he heard that He had left, as if he had lost his right and left hands. Two days later, He returned to see Gaozu. Gaozu was both angry and happy and scolded He:</p>
<p>"You've also escaped?"</p>
<p>"I dare not escape, I went to chase an escapee."</p>
<p>"Who are you chasing?"</p>
<p>"Chasing Han Xin."</p>
<p>"There are more than ten escapees, you didn't chase any of them. Today you're chasing Xin, it's a lie." Gaozu scolded impolitely.</p>
<p>"The generals are easy to get, they can leave if they want, why chase them? As for Xin, he is a national talent, unparalleled in the world." He also replied impolitely to Gaozu, "If you only want to be the King of Hanzhong forever, then of course you don't need Xin; if you definitely want to compete for the world, then you must have Xin. But I don't know what you plan to do?"</p>
<p>"I plan to march east and compete for the world, how can I live here gloomily for a long time?"</p>
<p>"You originally intended to go east. In that case, Xin is useful, if you can use Xin, Xin will stay, if you can't use him, he will eventually leave."</p>
<p>"In that case, for your sake, I will use him as a general." Gaozu was still somewhat reluctant.</p>
<p>"Even as a general, Xin will definitely not be willing to stay."</p>
<p>"Then make him a great general?"</p>
<p>"That would be excellent!" He replied happily.</p>
<p>So Gaozu wanted to summon Xin to appoint him as a great general, and He said: "You have always been arrogant and rude. Today, when you appoint a great general, you're calling him over like you're calling a child, so Xin will leave. If you must appoint him, please choose a good day, fast, set up an altar, and hold the ceremony solemnly according to the grandest etiquette."</p>
<p>Gaozu listened entirely to He's words. The army prepared on a large scale, and everyone knew that Gaozu was going to appoint a great general, but no one knew whom he would appoint. So the generals were all happy, each thinking that they had hope of becoming a great general. Unexpectedly, when it came time to appoint the great general, it was actually Han Xin. The entire army was surprised, thinking that Gaozu had gone crazy.</p>
<p>After the ceremony was completed, Xin sat in the top seat, and the King of Han respectfully asked: "The Prime Minister often says that General is a genius, I don't know what instructions General has for me?"</p>
<p>Xin thanked him very humbly, and then asked Gaozu: "Today, you are marching east to compete for the world, is your opponent Xiang Yu?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Please estimate yourself, Your Majesty, how do your courage, strength, benevolence, and power compare to Xiang Yu?"</p>
<p>Gaozu thought silently for a long time before saying: "I can't compare!"</p>
<p>Xin quickly stood up and bowed again to congratulate him: "I also think Your Majesty can't compare. But he is not to be feared. I have also served him, and I know his character very well, please let me tell you: Xiang Yu is secretly malicious and easily angered, and he can dismiss a thousand people at will, but he cannot employ virtuous generals, this is nothing more than the courage of a common man. When Xiang Yu sees people, he is respectful and loving, and speaks with a gentle tone; when people are sick, he sheds tears and sends them food; but when people have merit and deserve to be ennobled, he carves the seal and leaves it until it is broken, he is still reluctant to give it to them, this is what is called the benevolence of a woman. Although Xiang Yu dominates the world and subjugates the feudal lords, he does not reside in Guanzhong but in Pengcheng, which violates the agreement with Emperor Yi; he ennobles his own beloved people as feudal lords, which is unfair. The feudal lords saw Xiang Yu exile Emperor Yi, and they all followed his example, turning around and exiling their own lords, seizing good land. Xiang Yu's passage is marked by destruction. The world is full of resentment, and the people do not support him. Those who temporarily obey him are only being held captive by his power. Although he is nominally a hegemon, he has actually lost the hearts of the people. That is why I say that his strength can easily turn to weakness. If Your Majesty can truly reverse what Xiang Yu has done, and use the warriors of the world, what cannot be conquered? If you use the cities and towns of the world to ennoble meritorious officials, who will not submit? If you use righteous soldiers to follow those who yearn to return east, what cannot be overcome? Moreover, the three kings of Qin were originally Qin generals, but they betrayed and surrendered to Chu, allowing Xiang Yu to deceitfully bury more than 200,000 Qin soldiers who had surrendered, and only these three traitors escaped safely. Today, they rely on Xiang Yu's support and have actually become kings of Qin. The Qin elders resent these three people, and they hate them to the bone, and no one loves them. As for Your Majesty's entry into Wuguan, you did not commit the slightest offense, you abolished the harsh laws of Qin, and you only made a three-chapter agreement with the Qin people. None of the Qin people do not wish for Your Majesty to be the King of Qin. Moreover, according to the agreement of the feudal lords, Your Majesty should be king of Guanzhong, and the people of Guanzhong all know this. Today, Your Majesty is forced to give up Guanzhong, and the people of Qin all hate it. Given the situation, if Your Majesty raises troops to march east, the three Qins can be pacified immediately with a simple proclamation."</p>
<p>Gaozu was very pleased after hearing Xin's words, and he deeply regretted not having met him sooner. So he listened to Xin's words, and he succeeded in capturing the three Qins without any effort. In the future, Gaozu listened and followed his advice, and in the end, he relied on Xin's intelligence to unify all of China.</p>
<p>It is said that after Han Xin achieved fame and success, he looked for the washerwoman to repay her kindness but couldn't find her, so he wept bitterly and threw a thousand gold coins into the washing pond as a memorial.</p>
<h3>Lü He Fenke (Continued) (1632-1723)</h3>
<p>— Wu Bixiong</p>
<p>—The First Person to Know About Microorganisms—</p>
<p>How pleased Balboa must have been when he was the first European to discover the Pacific Ocean! However, this ocean was as familiar to the Indians of Central America as the Mediterranean Sea was to Balboa. Lü He Fenke's discovery of microorganisms was not like this! The situation he experienced was one that no one in the world had ever experienced; his discovery was of a living world invisible to the naked eye. They had been living and fighting with each other since ancient times, and like humans, they experienced prosperity and death, but no one had ever known anything about them. Although they are tens of millions of times smaller than humans, some of them are so harmful that they can wipe out mankind. Even venomous snakes and fierce beasts are not as terrifying as these insidious demons: they do not spare smiling infants in cradles, nor do they let go of arrogant emperors under heavy guard. Before this frenzied doorkeeper, no one in the world had ever lingered for a moment in this wonderland.</p>
<p>He continued to observe rainwater, and successively discovered various different microorganisms.</p>
<p>However, there was a question that stumped this tireless researcher. Where did those tiny, unbelievable little things in the raindrops come from? Did they fall from the sky? Did they crawl from the ground into the water? Or were they created by God?</p>
<p>Lü He Fenke was a devout believer in God, and his sound reason told him that "life comes from life". He thought it was too meaningless to think about things like insects falling from the sky! How to solve this mystery? Wait, there is a way: "experiment".</p>
<p>It was raining. Lü He Fenke took a wine glass, washed it carefully, and placed it under the outlet of the gutter under the eaves. He used his hair-thin glass tube to suck up a small drop of rainwater, and hurried to his lens. Look! There were still small creatures in the rainwater, swimming around. He initially thought that there were also microorganisms in the fresh rainwater, but then he thought again, and felt that this was not proof, they might be living in the gutter and were washed out by the rainwater.</p>
<p>He took a large porcelain basin, washed it clean, and braved the rain to place it on a tall box, so that the dirt on the ground would not splash into it. He poured out the rainwater that filled it for the first time, to make the basin cleaner. Then he used the tip of the tube to carefully take a small drop of rainwater, and ran to the laboratory to observe it.</p>
<p>"I have proved it! There is not a single creature in this water. So these microorganisms do not fall from the sky."</p>
<p>Did this Dutchman immediately write to the Royal Society and boast about his discovery to the world? No, he was not willing to act rashly. He took river water, ditch water, and well water to observe, and found that there were microorganisms in all of them. Only then did he feel confident.</p>
<p>Now he wrote a long letter to the Royal Society, telling them about his latest discovery. Some of the learned members were very skeptical of him. What! Did this Dutchman want them to believe that there were such small creatures in the world, and that a small drop of water contained more than the entire population of his country! Nonsense! The maggots in dry cheese were the smallest creatures created by God. Fortunately, some of them took Lü's report very seriously, so they asked him to explain in detail.</p>
<p>Lü He Fenke reported the process of his research in detail to the Royal Society. The Royal Society also conducted the same experiment based on the report, and the results showed that Lü did not lie, and his discovery was indeed a major scientific discovery, so they invited him to become a member.</p>
<p>This scientist, who searched everywhere like a puppy, later thought about the white filth on his teeth, what exactly was it? He scraped some off his teeth, diluted it with pure rainwater, and sucked a little with a thin glass tube. He put it under his microscope to observe. ...</p>
<p>Ah! There were many different small creatures inside: they displayed various comical movements. People discovered that everyone's mouth contained a zoo, who would have thought of that! If they are not expelled, they will ruin the teeth. He confirmed his theory from several friends who did not brush their teeth.</p>
<p>Although he had already made unique achievements in oblique science, he still worked hard to move forward. What he discovered in his long-term keen observations constantly surprised scientists. He discovered blood cells in the tail of a small fish, discovered capillaries, and saw those blood cells flowing from arteries to veins through capillaries, unintentionally confirming Harvey's theory. For his microscope, which saw everything, there was no so-called mystery, no so-called dirt, no so-called lowliness. If he were not a pragmatist and brought various interesting things into the scope of his research, we would definitely feel that the ruthless science would make people's heads ache even more, and the mysterious microorganisms would definitely be even more difficult to attract attention and even more difficult to believe.</p>
<p>Lü He Fenke's reputation grew day by day, and he continued to explore the secrets of that magical world. All the glory did not change his humble research attitude in the slightest. What is the reason for this? Because he already had a noble will to "seek the truth".</p>
<p>Lü was a very healthy old man. He liked to drink alcohol. When he got drunk, he used very hot coffee to sober up. In the process of studying microorganisms, he often discovered fresh research materials from his daily life. One day, he got drunk again, and of course drank a lot of very hot coffee. He happened to think of observing the zoo in his mouth that he had discovered earlier: he picked some dental dirt from his incisors to observe, and saw that it was full of the corpses of small creatures, and he no longer saw their activity, only one or two were still wriggling weakly, like suffering from a serious illness. It turned out that the hot coffee had killed the microorganisms on the incisors. He then observed the filth between the molars, but it was still the same as before, with many lively microorganisms still active inside. He mixed some water in. He put it on the fire and burned it very hot. All the movements of the microorganisms followed the increase in temperature. At first, the movements were sluggish, and finally they stopped. They could not survive any longer. Therefore, he was even more certain that it was the heat of the coffee that killed the microorganisms on his incisors. The fact that heating can kill microorganisms tells us about a very effective modern disinfection method.</p>
<p>Lü had passed the age of eighty. Although he was still healthy, his teeth began to shake; he did not complain about the inevitable phenomenon of old age. Instead, he pulled out a few bad teeth and pointed the lens at the hollow roots to study them. Friends advised him to give up his research work and rest in his old age. The old man frowned and answered his friend with burning eyes:</p>
<p>"The fruits that ripen in autumn are the most durable!" At the high age of eighty-five, he was only in the autumn of his life!</p>
<p>In 1723, this hard-working man passed away (end)</p>

<h3>Review of the Normal School Series of the Zhengzhong Book Company</h3>
<p>— Dechang</p>
<p>In the past two years, the Nanjing Zhengzhong Book Company has contributed to education and academia, in addition to the monthly publication of the Education and Learning Magazine, it has also published many educational books. Among them, the following are particularly relevant to elementary education:</p>
<p>1. Implementation Method of Single-Grade Primary School, written by Wu Ding</p>
<p>2. Primary School Funding Management Method, compiled by Qiu Yexin</p>
<p>3. Standard Teaching Method, jointly translated by Pu Yiren and Huang Zongming</p>
<p>4. Practical Multi-Grade Teaching Method, compiled by Shang Yinzhuang</p>
<p>5. Research on Teaching Methods of Various Subjects in Lower Grades of Primary School, compiled by Zhang Gengxi, revised by Shen Zishan</p>
<p>6. Primary School Speaking Teaching Method, compiled by Wang Guoyuan</p>
<p>7. Health Education, written by Gao Jie</p>
<p>8. Theory and Practice of Production Education, compiled by Jiang Jinsha</p>
<p>9. Waste Utilization Craft Teaching Materials, compiled by Wu Wenming and Xu Jian'an</p>
<p>10. Primary School Teaching Aid Production Method, compiled by Ying Huaixun and Sun Yifen</p>
<p>Of these ten books, one and two are about administration; the Implementation Method of Single-Grade Primary School has a total of ten chapters, and all important issues such as the organization, teaching, training, and equipment of single-grade primary schools are described in detail, and many practical examples are given for easy reference. The funding problem is the fundamental problem for the implementation of primary school education, and the Primary School Funding Management Method is a special study of this practical problem. Three to six are about teaching methods. The Standard Teaching Method is a translation of the book Sxandard　Pracdiecsim　Deaching by American education scholars Baglery and Macdonald. The translation is relatively faithful and can be used as a general reference. As for multi-grade teachers, lower-grade teachers, and Chinese teachers, they can refer to the Practical Multi-Grade Teaching Method, Research on Teaching Methods of Various Subjects in Lower Grades of Primary School, and Primary School Speaking Teaching Method respectively. Seven to ten are about various important issues in primary school education. Health Education not only mentions the equipment of physical education, hygiene, and medicine, but also other health-related issues, such as teaching school building construction, are also described from the standpoint of health education. Recently, production education has moved from advocacy to implementation. The Theory and Practice of Production Education is concise and worth reading. Among the various subjects in primary school, the one that is most closely related to production education is labor. The two books, Waste Utilization Craft Teaching Materials and Primary School Teaching Aid Production Method, can be used as references. In short, these ten books are quite suitable for general primary school teachers to refer to in terms of content. However, there are slight shortcomings in terms of printing. For example, the copyright page of the Standard Teaching Method does not include the original book title and the name of the original author, making it difficult for readers to understand its source. The version of Research on Teaching Methods of Various Subjects in Lower Grades of Primary School is larger than the other volumes, making it inconvenient to carry. These need to be improved during the reprint. I think the book company will be happy to accept these small opinions.</p>
<h3>"Service and Self-Cultivation"</h3>
<p>— Li Hantian</p>
<p>Compiled by Zhao Zongyu, published by the Commercial Press</p>
<p>There are two major tasks in life: self-cultivation and service. These two major tasks can also be said to be the most important in the progress of human life. Everyone hopes to cultivate a healthy person in a practical way, facing the real world; at the same time, because people are supplied by society and live in society, they should serve society in terms of morality and obligation. In short, because people cannot leave society, and society is not just one person, so it is necessary to study how to adapt to society and how to benefit society, this is self-cultivation, and the purpose of self-cultivation lies in serving society, in improving the tools of service.</p>
<p>The objects of self-cultivation and service are both society, not for oneself, but for society, which is the most accurate explanation. Self-cultivation and service cannot be separated and mutually affect their effectiveness. According to this point of view, practical instructions are given to seek progress. This is the spirit of the book "Service and Self-Cultivation".</p>
<p>"Service and Self-Cultivation" was written by Mr. Zhao Zongyu for young people working in the industry in general. The entire book contains 200,000 words and is divided into three volumes, upper, middle, and lower, and has been taught in vocational supplementary schools and other places. The first part is about moral self-cultivation, teaching people how to be a person, how to cultivate ambition, how to achieve a happy life, the methods between movement and stillness, one's own awareness and self-knowledge of strengths and weaknesses, seeking to achieve omnipotence with both hands from automatic ability, and striving for perseverance, frugality, and savings to remain unchanged, overcoming difficulties, struggling with adversity, and coping with favorable circumstances; then using self-control to study methods of dealing with people, one should use basic morals such as loyalty, forgiveness, mutual love, and compassion.</p>
<p>As for the moral self-cultivation of service, one should first pay attention to one's personal work and character, so that one can cultivate one's research spirit, use scientific methods, and creative instincts, and strive for cooperation through struggle and sacrifice, have a spirit of rule of law, and have a spirit of faith in one's profession, especially on the fork in the road of success or failure, one must pay attention to the exploration of time, thought, life, difficulties, criticism, opportunities, will, and morality, so as not to fall into the confusion of youth.</p>
<p>The second part is about seeking knowledge and physical self-cultivation. One should clearly understand the purpose and path of seeking knowledge, and at the same time require an attitude and habits of seeking knowledge, and should also determine a plan for seeking knowledge, seeking the economy of time and spirit, so for the choice of subjects, the classification of the form and utility of subjects, and the standards for selecting subjects, and at the same time for the selection of books, how to explore and learn them, how to understand them, how to memorize them, how to take notes, these are extremely important tasks. But seeking knowledge requires tools, the first tool is "seeing", "reading", "writing", and "composing", the second tool is to learn foreign languages, for the choice of foreign languages, the reading method, grammar, writing, conversation, etc.; the third tool is the source of common sense, strive to enrich it, the methods should be more visits, travel, interviews, talks, lectures, and more work, etc.</p>
<p>For the cultivation of ability, such as mental arithmetic and written calculation in calculation; different methods of dealing with things, objects, and people in handling affairs; speaking skills and the skills of expression and smiling; and the skills of senses and limbs, etc. Self-cultivation and service are all connected.

<h3>How to Prepare, What to Prepare?</h3>
<p>— Tianyu</p>
<p>In the Sunday Forum of this newspaper on the 21st, Mr. Ye Gongchao said in his article "The Prelude to the Anti-Japanese War II": "In the future, we will not be able to recover an inch of lost land without war, and we will not be able to save 30 million compatriots in dire straits without war." This is not just the words of Mr. Ye alone, but the words that all the people of the country want to say, and they all recognize that this sentence is a "truth" that is thousands of times true. The important question now is how to "fight"? Immediate war? Slow war? A war with preparation? Or is the national crisis imminent, and there is no room for long-term consideration and we must fight immediately? If we are preparing, what should we prepare, and how should we prepare? Mr. Ye's answer is: "Since we have identified our way out, we must think about how we can survive from now until the day of the frontal conflict; not only survive, but also prepare and build." Let's talk about the question of how to prepare and what to prepare.</p>
<p>Modern military strategists and politicians all agree that "modern warfare is a war of national power." The "national power" referred to here usually only includes the number of soldiers in a country, the degree of military equipment, and more importantly, combat resources, such as mineral products, food, and even transportation. But they all happen to forget a kind of greatest "national power" that can determine the final victory or defeat of the war, and that is "the power of all the people"! In the eyes of those who despise the power of the people and doubt the power of the people, saying that the power of all the people is the greatest national power that determines the final victory or defeat of the war may be considered a joke, but if we do not forget that many great changes in history have been completed with the power of the broad masses of the people, such as the success of the Northern Expedition, this fact cannot be denied. Therefore, we believe that in the situation where the enemy's high industrial technology is far different from the backward industrial level of our country, when it comes to preparation, if we only work hard on military equipment and combat resources, this is the most difficult method to be effective. The situation is very clear, we walk one mile, they walk ten miles or a hundred miles, this is really similar to the ancient saying: "Kuafu chasing the sun". Therefore, we believe that today we will not talk about preparation, if we talk about it, then the only way is to organize the people as soon as possible, train the people, and most importantly, cultivate the determination of the people to resist the enemy! Naturally, it is not to say that military preparation is not needed, but it is still secondary, at least military preparation and cultivating the power of the people to resist the enemy should be placed on the same important foundation.</p>
<p>And we try to recall the wars of the past January 28th, the war of Xifengkou on the Great Wall, and even the recent war of resistance in Suiyuan, every time a real war of resistance was launched, the power of the people followed the urgency and fierceness of the war of resistance and was vigorously exerted. These are all facts. We can say that the power of the people to resist the enemy, which is hidden in the whole country, is endless, and has been taught by many strange and tragic facts in the past few years, and this power is increasing and developing day by day. Now there is only one question left: how to use this power as the most powerful weapon against foreign enemies. Therefore, we believe that what needs to be prepared is to absorb the power of the people as the most powerful backing for the government against foreign enemies, and this requires bringing the potential power to the surface of society and turning it into a movement, in order to achieve this goal. We believe that the most important thing to prepare now is this.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye said with deep pain: "But to endure pain without a plan is only the skill of a slave." We deeply hope that every citizen can be organized to the forefront to be an anti-Japanese "warrior" and not let everyone prepare to be a "slave" in the future. This is the best way.</p>
<h3>In January</h3>
<p>— Shidai</p>
<p>On the morning of the first day of the new year, the countryside is filled with abstract joy. Men and women, old and young, none of them are not full of joy, the streets are floating with beautiful sunlight, groups of people come and go, the brand-new clothes are obviously a new beginning that is growing. No matter if there is hatred or hatred in the past, you have to make a bow and say hello when you meet, even those who were forced to force debts yesterday, now they have to smile at each other and say: "Happy new year and get rich"—in the tile houses and thatched huts, every family has someone coming to "pay New Year's greetings". There is no distinction between "surname" and "clan" in the village, and they all have to "pay New Year's greetings" to each other. This custom inherited from ancestors of unknown years cannot be changed by anyone. In the new year, this village is harmonious and kind, and the jealousy, hatred, and disgust between people disappear completely.</p>
<p>Children are in groups on the street setting off firecrackers, "playing nests" (a kind of children's gambling game), and "catching up" (a kind of chasing game). Most of the semi-strong men are kicking shuttlecocks and playing "noisemakers" (i.e., gongs and drums) on the open space in front of the ancestral temple. But women are rarely seen. Except for little girls, adults cannot run on the street casually. According to ancient rules, women are not allowed to go to the street for more than three times, and they are not allowed to go to other people's houses before the sixth day of the new year. During this time, women stay at home eating, drinking, and sleeping.</p>
<p>From the first to the fifteenth day of the first month, quarrels will never happen in this half month. The new year is an auspicious day, and if you quarrel, you will have bad luck for a year! Naturally, there are also some people who like to drink alcohol. After getting drunk, they let people say and scold them, and sometimes the quarrel makes it impossible for other people's banquets to proceed smoothly. But this cannot cause the other party's anger. Everyone should be tolerant, patient, and avoid conflicts with others.</p>
<p>After the third day of the first month, the men began to "visit relatives". On the mountain roads, official roads, and roads of all sizes, there are almost all people carrying red and green packages or carrying "yuan dou baskets" (a kind of willow-woven basket with beams), coming and going. Women also freed themselves from a shackle from this day on. They dressed up neatly and prettily, and went to the ancestral hall in groups of three or five to see the "sacrificial offerings". They criticized which "sacrificial offerings" were made beautifully and which were the worst! The days always passed like river water, and the sixth day of the first month came in the blink of an eye. At this time, the "visiting relatives" stopped, and the men were busy making things for "making the Lantern Festival lively".</p>
<p>In particular, the women were waiting for the "Lantern Festival". At that time, officials will put on "stilt parades" and sing Yangko, there will be swings to play on, and there will be "Yellow River" strings. Everyone will try their best to dress up beautifully, who doesn't look forward to it? Even the old women with white hair are anxious to listen to Yangko. Before the tenth day of the first month, mothers encouraged their sons and daughters-in-law to beg their husbands to take the lead in organizing the "entertainment party". So the young people went out. The first thing to do is to hang the swings. In the village, they chose three or four spacious places, buried large wooden stakes, and then collected rice straw from door to door. They spread many rice straws into large thick ropes, and then they hung the swings. In one day, they hung up the "wheel swing," "hanging swing," and "dragon gate swing" with ease. The women were all attracted by the swings, and they kept playing them all day long, because it was the new year, the men would not quarrel with her, so they could be willful and free.</p>
<p>Then those young men who organized the Yangko entertainment party got busy! During the day, they practiced stilts on the wheat field, and at night they gathered in empty houses to rehearse the Yangko, beating gongs and drums, and rehearsing every sentence until they were familiar with it. When the "Yangko" and "stilts" were well-rehearsed, they temporarily stopped and busied themselves with making the "Yellow River". According to the rules, the "Yellow River" had to be made well by the fourteenth day, so that people could string it on the fifteenth day. The so-called "Yellow River" comes from myths and legends. In the event of a flood, the victims would flee to other provinces and counties. Although the hometown is far away from the Yellow River, sometimes they are afraid of "famine refugees" coming to harass them, so they set up the "Yellow River" on the flat ground. People can avoid disaster by stringing in it. The method of making the "Yellow River" is to bury 720 wooden stakes on a vast and flat ground, and then use grass ropes as thick as fingers to connect the wooden stakes into a winding space, leaving two "entrances" in the center of the "edge". The person who strings in enters from the entrance, and can come out from the "exit" only after stringing every space. As long as you "enter the entrance", you cannot return or turn back halfway. It is said that you will not be able to avoid a flood if you do not finish stringing. In short, the villagers create a lot of excuses to protect superstition.</p>
<p>"The Lantern Festival" is a night of revelry in the countryside. People are crazy and happy beyond words. The stilt parades are all dressed up in colorful costumes, stringing in the "Yellow River". At the same time, flags and umbrellas are waving, and the lights are shining brightly. The lights on each wooden stake are like stars. On the large archway at the entrance of the "Yellow River", there is a row of "revolving lanterns" hanging. The bells and drums are loud, and firecrackers are constantly ringing, and super flowers (a kind of cannon) are running in the air. The village is reveling, and the "Yellow River" has become a "world of bliss".</p>
<p>After stringing the "Yellow River", the stilts rest. At this time, someone stands on two layers of tables and sets off fireworks. Finally, the audience forms a large circle, and the stilt parade sings Yangko, and they don't go back until dawn.</p>
<p>After the "Lantern Festival", on the first day, the "Yangko Society" from other villages came to sing Yangko, and there was a Yangko Society for three consecutive days, and the countryside became lonely again.</p>
<h3>Street Scene</h3>
<h3>Poet and Reality</h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>It snowed all day, and by evening it grew even heavier. Vehicles and horses had disappeared from the roads, and only one or two pedestrians hurried past with their heads buried in their collars. The rooftops and roads were the same, covered with white snow that smoothed out the unevenness, losing their original appearances.</p>
<p>Ling, with his poetic temperament, decided to find a northern-style inn to stay in. He said that staying in a Shanghai-style hotel with modern amenities like water heaters, and seeing snow scenes of roads, just wasn't authentic enough. We were already worried that so many people wouldn't fit in our small room, so of course we agreed with his suggestion. Therefore, regardless of how heavily the snow was falling, we pulled up our coat collars, left our footprints in the snow, and chatted and laughed as we went to find a northern-style inn.</p>
<p>We didn't walk far before we found one. The inn had a large courtyard, and the doors of the rooms opened directly onto it. There were some flowers and trees in the courtyard, and a small pond. The snow made them look especially beautiful. Along the corridor, under some small trees with lingering leaves blown in by the wind, there should have been a mule. And there should have been a woman wearing green cotton pants and a red cotton jacket tending the stove to greet us, but instead, the servant led us to a room.</p>
<p>The room had a cotton door curtain, the color of which was dull and faded, and it was impossible to tell what color it had originally been. There was a small stove in the center of the room, but it was unlit. All the furnishings were simple, but at the time we thought they were quaint and interesting, so we didn't say anything and settled in. We only told the servant to quickly light the stove.</p>
<p>The stove was lit, we took off our leather shoes and put on slippers, warmed our frozen feet by the stove, turned off the central light, and only allowed the small cabinet lamp to emit a dim light. Holding a cup of hot tea in our hands, we really felt a bit of ancient charm. Especially since the three of us sitting around the stove were all good friends who could talk about anything. Although we were already young adults in age, we were all still big kids at heart. Each of us had a bright and pure dream, but those dreams were covered with dust and grease.</p>
<p>Such a setting quickly made one think of "Liaozhai Zhiyi" or "Autumn Lamp Night Rain". The inn was large and old, the wind howled outside, and the light switch was too loose and located outside the door. When the wind blew, the central light, which was originally off, would flicker on. Ling, the oldest but most childish of us, was the first to shout:</p>
<p>"A fox spirit has come!"</p>
<p>Ming looked towards the door with a look of surprise and joy, saying:</p>
<p>"Wen, the girl in green cotton pants and a red cotton jacket that you keep talking about has come."</p>
<p>Such a setting was originally suitable for discussing fox spirits and ghosts, but somehow we strayed into other topics. Ling was conceiving a new play, and he wanted to write a tragicomedy about the superficial harmony and inner conflicts between him and his friends. Ming said that he still didn't have a lover and needed one, while I was reminiscing about a distant and still unrealized dream: I wanted a younger sister who was deeply experienced and worldly.</p>
<p>The stove fire was dying down, and there was not much coal left in the coal bucket. After throwing the last few pieces of coal into the stove, we all went to bed to avoid the cold after the fire went out.</p>
<p>After getting into bed, Ling, near the lamp, was reading "China's</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Opera Stage</h3>
<p>— Respectfully Listening</p>
<p>Miss Fangzi is a famous singer on the opera stage. She has a gifted voice, and every time she appears on stage to sing, her "rainbow dress"-like gorgeous songs and nightingale-like singing truly captivate the audience. Especially the young Mr. Li, who admired her even more.</p>
<p>But once, after a performance, she returned home late at night and caught a cold. At first, she had a lot of phlegm and coughed, but later it gradually turned into a hoarse voice. She was so anxious!</p>
<p>The young Mr. Li, upon receiving this news, quickly bought a "bottle of Five Continents White Pine Sugar Syrup" and sent it to her. After she took it, her cough soon stopped, and her throat was no longer hoarse. When she sang again, her voice was as beautiful as before. Mr. Li's joy at gaining the favor of the beauty can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Streamlined Cosmetics</h3>
<p>— Fragrant</p>
<p>Streamlined trains, cars, airplanes, etc., all have particularly high efficiency. It is expected that there will be many new inventions in the future that are streamlined tools. Now, there is indeed "streamlined romance," which is said to "break through the highest heat of flirting! and invent the newest posture of courtship!"</p>
<p>I think: Since there is "streamlined romance," there should be "streamlined cosmetics." The so-called "streamlined cosmetics" are of course particularly effective and have particularly new manufacturing methods. Just like the "San-Yi Hair Tonic" produced by Five Continents, which gives a thick and lasting fragrance to the hair. "San-Yi Perfume" has a light and elegant fragrance that intoxicates the senses. And "Yi Pin Xiang" and "Beauty Cream," etc., all have special effects of transforming ugliness into beauty, and can be called "streamlined cosmetics". They are worth recommending to men and women who love beauty.</p>
<h3>Constipation Harms Health</h3>
<p>— Runzhi</p>
<p>We eat three meals a day and must defecate once a day to ensure that waste products in the body do not accumulate. This keeps the blood flowing smoothly and the spirit refreshed. Conversely, if residue accumulates in the intestines, it can easily produce toxins that harm health. Taking one or two (Weiling Laxative Pills) can achieve the goal of natural bowel movements. Because the pill is made from the effective ingredients extracted from plants, it is precisely effective and has no drawbacks. Each bottle of twenty pills is sold for only three dimes. The general distributor is Zhengwei Pharmacy at the intersection of Yinghua Street and Second Road. Telephone: 92525.</p>
<h3>Weiling Essence-Consolidating Tablets Effectively Treat Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>— Yishou</p>
<p>During puberty, young people are easily induced by bad influences and commit masturbation, or engage in prostitution and excessive indulgence, all of which can contribute to seminal emission. In the early stages, it may not seem significant, but over time, the secreted fluid becomes thin, and sexual function is sharply reduced. Even during formal intercourse, premature ejaculation is inevitable, and even impotence may occur, leading to despair of reproduction. Although in the prime of youth, one ultimately becomes weak. The harm is indescribable. "Weiling Essence-Consolidating Tablets" are a special medicine with an effective treatment for seminal emission and nocturnal emission. The effect is immediately apparent after taking them, and there are no side effects. Prolonged use is not habit-forming. It is truly a safe and harmless remedy. Each bottle costs one dollar and fifty cents and is sold at Zhengwei Pharmacy on Second Road.</p>

<p>Northwest Corner" of China. Ming likened the character "Zi" to a shrimp. I don't know when he fell asleep. Outside the window, the wind howled, causing the window frames to shake. The electric light flickered, bringing with it an atmosphere of terror. Many thoughts were rising and falling in my mind, but I couldn't find any coherence. Just when I had a little coherence and wanted to ponder a few questions, the cold after the stove fire went out attacked us stubbornly. The thin quilt really didn't have any ability to resist.</p>
<p>Ling was also attacked by the cold and couldn't read his book. Ming was also frozen awake. He couldn't sleep, but it was too early to get up. The two of them tossed and turned and "shared the bed to talk" until dawn.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, we endured until dawn. The three of us escaped from that icebox-like room as if fleeing. The snow scenery in the courtyard was too beautiful.</p>
<p>Back at the hotel where our friends were staying, some of our friends who knew that we had been acting like refined gentlemen the night before asked us how many volumes of poetry we had written. I smiled and quickly slipped into bed to catch up on sleep.</p>

<p>The sky is clear, the wind is gentle, and the air is refreshing. Several lines of new geese fly across the sky. The busy courtier Gao Lishi is cleaning the imperial garden with great effort. The autumn scenery in the inner garden is endless, with lingering lotus in the ponds everywhere. Soon it is reported that Emperor Ming has arrived, with his favorite concubine Yang by his side. Countless osmanthus flowers fill the air with fragrance, and sometimes parrots call to each other. A royal banquet is arranged in the flower pavilion, with delicacies from the sea and mountains covering the table. Slender jade hands hold golden wine pots. The emperor sips his cup, the concubine sings, and her "rainbow dress" dance is unparalleled in the world. Taizhen kneels and offers three cups of wine, and the emperor happily takes her hand. Concubine Yang is drunk on Concubine Yang's couch, a picture of a sleeping beauty amidst crabapple blossoms, her drunken state becoming even more enchanting. Little did she know that joy was not yet complete when sorrow arrived. It is said that An Lushan rebelled and unleashed his army, directly threatening the capital. What is to be done? The great Kang dynasty has enjoyed peace for a long time, and the civil and military officials have no means to resist the enemy. Quickly order the six armies to protect the emperor, and hastily travel to Shu to temporarily avoid the flames of war. Alas, the delicate and beautiful woman, her jade shattered and fragrance extinguished, died at Mawei Slope.</p>

<p>"Falling Sunset and Lonely Duck"</p>
<p>Falling Xia suffered all the insults of her cousin Zhu Liufeng. Not only could she not resist, but she was also scolded by Zhao Chongfu and his wife.</p>
<p>Unable to vent her grievances, Falling Xia ran back to her room and cried bitterly. The more she thought about it, the more she felt that her life was too miserable. So she had a thought of death. While Zhao Chongfu was upstairs, she secretly ran to the old master's smoking room and took half a cup of opium. She waited until midnight to mix it with boiling water and end her life. Fortunately, when Zhao Chongfu was smoking, he noticed that the opium was a little less. He suspected that Falling Xia might be committing suicide. He hurried to Falling Xia's window to peek in and saw Falling Xia holding a bowl and preparing to take poison. Zhao Chongfu opened the door and threw the opium and bowl to the ground. Because Zhao Chongfu was afraid that Falling Xia's actions would implicate him, he sent Falling Xia to the Women and Children's Asylum the next morning.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly. It had been more than five months since Falling Xia entered the asylum. According to the rules of the asylum, when the girls grew up, they should take photos and hang them in the reception room so that people could see them and take them away. For other girls, taking photos was a very</p>

<h3>The Twentieth Century Drama Society Revives Sai Jinhua</h3>
<p>The seven-act historical defense drama "Sai Jinhua" stirred up tens of thousands of spectators in the city after it was performed here last year. Not only in the city, but also drama fans from Suzhou and Wuxi rushed to Shanghai to see it. However, as a vanguard performance of the national defense drama movement, relying solely on local activities is not enough. It must be developed more widely. For this reason, the Twentieth Century Drama Society has put in a lot of effort and resources, rehearsing for two or three months, and will hold its first public performance at the Golden Grand Theatre at the end of the lunar year. However, at that time, it happened to coincide with the suspension of publication of various newspapers, and because the theater's deadline was too tight, many spectators were unable to attend. In view of this, the society decided to revive "Sai Jinhua" on the 27th of this month (Saturday) at the Empire Theatre at Eight Bridges. "Sai Jinhua" and the darkness of the authorities in the "Sai Jinhua" era can also be seen as reflecting the current reality.</p>
<h3>The Great Light Screens "Murder in the Theatre"</h3>
<p>Frankenstein Battles Charlie Chan</p>
<p>Warner Oland, who is famous on the silver screen for specializing in the role of Chinese detective Charlie Chan, has been releasing Charlie Chan films one after another, and because the content of each film is different, the box office has always been strong. The great appeal is truly amazing. Now, Twentieth Century Fox has invited Frankenstein actor Boris Karloff and Warner Oland to co-star in "Murder in the Theatre" (Charlie Chan at The Opera). With these two powerhouses , of course, there is a good show to watch. The whole film is full of tension and suspense, making people shudder. The story tells of a man who was secretly murdered ten years ago and whose whereabouts are unknown. He returns to the theatre ten years later to take revenge, leading to a bizarre and headless murder case. In addition to Miloff and Warner Oland, Chinese star Lu , , also co-stars, playing Charlie Chan's son, a very important role, and his acting skills are quite good. The film will be released at the Great Light Cinema today.</p>
<h3>The Rich Are the Most Miserly</h3>
<p>Tianyi's "Wealth and Prosperity" is currently being filmed intensively. There is a scene in it that depicts the miserliness of the rich. Xiao Zhengzhong is a big landlord. His daughter Zhou Meijuan asks him for money to buy fabric, and he gives her a thousand dollars. But when some fundraisers come to him to raise money for the relief of Suiyuan, he is only willing to donate one dollar, fully demonstrating his miserliness. It is truly a humorous performance.</p>

<p>happy thing, because there was hope of leaving the asylum. But for Falling Xia and Feng Yuru, who lived in the same room and shared the same unfortunate fate, it added to their worries. Because after the photos were hung up, there were always several people who came to see them every day. Wasn't this a troublesome thing? Especially because Yuru was interested in someone named Li, and Falling Xia was interested in Jiang Qiuwu. So the two of them often made excuses, refusing because they were ill, to see the people who came to visit.</p>
<p>One day, Falling Xia and Yuru were chatting about their respective concerns when Aunt Deng ran in and repeatedly asked Falling Xia to go out to meet someone. Falling Xia had no choice but to brace herself to meet the visitor. Who knew that enemies would meet on a narrow road? The person who came to see her was her former master's cousin, Zhu Liufeng.</p>

<p>Ever since I saw you. I began to reduce my longing. Ever since I parted from you. I have been harmed by my longing. Alas! I do not know the reason why. I have formed this karma debt with you. I have never asked your name. I do not know how far your home is. Where are you from? What kind of person are you? Are you an ordinary person, or an immortal? I am just guessing. Just guessing. Your beautiful face. Is like a peach blossom just blooming. Your soft waist. Is like a willow branch swaying. Alas! Even though I am a painter. It is difficult to depict your kind of talent. Your thin eyebrows. Are hidden by a row of bangs. Your deep eyelashes. Are surrounded by a pool of autumn water. Two dimples swirl. White teeth are revealed when you smile. When I saw you then. How could I not love you. Now that I am separated from you, how unhappy I am. These past few days. I don't want to drink tea. I am always. Confused. It is unbearable.</p>
