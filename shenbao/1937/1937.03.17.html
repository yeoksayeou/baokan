<p>時評</p>
<h3>意相北非之行與英國</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>英意在地中海與非洲的利益衝突。當東非戰爭時會達到極高的頂點。但至國聯取消對意制裁時則已渐𧺤緩和。到了今年一月地中海紳士協定簽訂後。二國的開係始恢復正常的狀態。所有過去的糾紛與衝勢。似已完全消失。可見這種情形祇能維持很短的時期。因為帝國主義國家間的利害衝突。是不能根本解決的。因此在英意協定成立後。不久意國即將大批軍隊運往西班牙作戰。以圖改變西地中海的現狀。這於抱着息事𫁼人意見的英國。當然是一個很大的打擊。可是法西斯蒂的侵略野心並不以此為止境。因此最近黑衫首相又有北非之行。並在那里發表法斯西的殖民政策。這都是進一步向英國以及其他殖民帝國挑戰的行動。</p>
<p>黑衫首相的北非之行。表面上是為參加公路的落成禮。實際上則為巡視意國向英挑戰的準備工作。意國的里比亞殖民地近十餘年來在德波諾與巴爾波總督統治之下。已經有很大的發展。最近通車之一千九百公里長的沿海汽車路。在軍事上的意義頗爲重大。而新近築成之東北口岸的托勃拉乞（tobrcrcb）根據地。在地中海的戰略上，尤佔重要的地位。因為從托勃拉乞向東北。可與洛特斯（Rbodas）島。連接向西北方面則可與班脫里拉島（paotclleria）根據地保持密切的關係。這實是意大利地中海生命綫之最重要的一段。黑衫首相這次北非之行。亦即為檢視意國在這－方面的軍事準備工作。以圖在非洲繼續發展法西斯的勢力。</p>
<p>墨索里尼此行雖含有對英示威的意義。但尚不十分明顯。不過他最近所發表之“意國的回民政策。”則顯然是向英國及其他殖民列強挑戰的。墨氏在所發表的小冊子中。自稱為“回教徒及阿拉伯人之唯一保護者。”並謂地中海諸回教國家之得享受承平者。祇有里比亞一國。其他在英法等國統治的亞耳日里亞•摩洛哥•都尼斯•及巴勒斯坦等地。則時有騷擾之事發生。墨索里尼的這種自誇。實含有重要的意義。因為他既以“回教徒及阿拉伯人之唯一保護者”自居。則凡同教徒與阿拉伯人所居之地。意大利都將要併吞之而淪為自己的殖民地。其野心之大。實為驚人。按全世界的回教徒不下二萬萬零九百萬之多。所居的土地也非常之廣。如照墨氏所說。則意大利就非成為世界上的第一個大殖民帝國不可了。其實在非洲的四千四百萬的回教徒中。受意大利統治“保護”的。祇不過五十萬人。而在英國統治之下的則有三千萬人。在法國統治下的也有九百萬人。現在墨氏竟以“回教徒及阿拉伯人的保讓者”自稱。這如果不是墨氏誇大狂的表現。那末一定是意圖已蓄有侵奪整個非洲的野心了。</p>
<p>墨索里尼的這種行動。一方面固然是法西斯意大利向外侵略政策的表現。一方面實為意圖故意對英示威。使其在歐洲一般問題的談判中表示讓步的態度。意大利這種方法的運用。以前曾經得到很大的成效。此次所得的結果如何。却要看英國是否仍探一退再退的態度來決定了。</p>
<h3>西歐公約問題將進一步談判</h3>
<p>但無早日成功希望　比國地位當先解決</p>
<p>［巴黎］意國駐法大使賽呂蒂•頃謁見外長召爾博斯、當以意國關于西歐公約問題、致英國政府復文之副本、遞交外長、（中央社十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>比京　德國駐比大使、頃以德國政府關于西歐公約問題致英國之備忘錄抄送比國外交部、官方人士對於此項備忘錄、不欲加以評論、惟一般視察者則以為此項文件、未能使國際局勢、增加何種新因素云、（十五日哈五斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］一般人以为德意兩國提出答復之後、法國官塲必信進一步談判之門業已開啓、但不認爲此項新公約、有早日成功之望、據稱台爾博斯曾預告俄大使謂、法國必能遵守其國際義務、相信比大使亦會同樣宣稱、比國對於國聯必將繼續忠守云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關于西歐公約問題。意國政府對于英國兩次照會之復文、業己送達此間、據負責方面透露消息、此項復文對于法蘇兩國互助公約、已在根本上說出異議、認為與一九二五年羅卡諾公約互相抵觸、並力主將該約中機械性的自動互助條欵、加以取銷、倘遇任何情勢、有指定“侵略國”之必要時、則應由英意保障兩國、負裁定之賓、此興德國態度如出一轍、－般觀察家認為德意兩國此種要求、不免過分、而尤以意國爲然、蓋意國曾用武力兼併阿比西尼亞、安可令其負裁定侵略國之責、觀察家又以為、英國早巳抱定決定、以國聯會盟約所載各項原則、為共外交政策之基礎、幫對於此次意德復文中所提辦法、自不能加以考慮、且意德兩國照會、顯然主張回復一九三三年英法德意四強公約、此則又與英國外交政策之現行趨勢、背道而馳、此外、負責方面以為、目前關於訂結西歐公約之談判、大約常集中於比國中立地位之一點、蓋就德意兩國復文所表示之態度以觀、目前所能解決者、亦惟比國中立地位一項問題而已、此一問頭應由英法德三國迅即成立妥協、傳克共同保障比國之安全、而比國則不必同時為保障國、且此再以迅速解決爲佳、否則比國或將設法與德國單獨訂立協定、以獲得德國之保障、如是德國地位當爲之增強、而英法兩國地位、自不免削弱矣、（中央社十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日本駐華軍人任意發言無益</h3>
<p>貴族院松村提出質問　並秘密討論綏遠問題　消除關東軍超然地位</p>
<p>［東京］貴族院今晨開會、對於駐華日本軍人任意發表聲明、以及綏遠問題、發生激烈辯論、松村義一向陸相提出質問、指出駐單日軍機關常發表對華外交聲明、尤以前年與去年為最多之事實謂此種行動即由常識加以判斷、亦屬有害、數日前、杉山陸相答復貴族院議員質問時、會實稱、將再發表開於塘沽協定之聲明、此項聲明最好不發、至此松村提及去年十一月二十二日外務省之宣言、聲明日本與綏遠事件完全無關、同時關東軍於上年十二月二十八日聲稱、綏遠事件乃蒙古軍隊之行動、但若危及滿洲時、關東軍將採取斷然態度等等、松村謂上述兩種聲明、極端衝突、陸相是否將對關東軍加以警告乎、</p>
<p>陸相杉山元、以滿洲事務局總裁資格作答、謂當與華北軍事協定有關事件發生時、駐華日軍部實有發表聲明之必要、但若將一部份軍官所發之意見、視作陸軍當局之意見、誠屬𢜩事、尤以過去兩年間為然、因當時違反軍事協定之事外、接連發生、故聲明亦隨之而多、此種行為、不為無益、而此種政策將繼續採行也、陸相繼為關東軍行為作辦、否認外務省與關東軍之聲明、係屬衝突、並謂當事件發生於其都近時、關東軍實不能緘默、本人不擬加以警告云、</p>
<p>松村再起發言、對陸相之答復、表示不滿、且認為完全不正確、謂軍事協定應盡可能予以公佈、俾衆週知、許多報紙對於華北之消息、誠非訪員自行捏造、而係日當地軍官所發表者、如此任意之發表聲明、為外交上所不充許、關於綏還問題、外務省聽明與日本無關、而關東軍則謂有關、此非衢突、熟為衝突、</p>
<p>此時辦論己甚激烈、另一議員岩會道具男爵起立、要求辯論改為祕密會議、俾得從容交換意見、但陸相毫不畏縮、答復謂、任何事件與陸軍司令官直接有關者、陸軍司令官當可發表聲明、但如遇意義重大之事件時、必取得外交當局或中央政府之同意也、至於外間認關東軍站在超然地位一層、厥後當注意消除此種印象、陸相继對綏遠事件、詳加解釋、但不予公佈、最後松村提出警告謂、郎當消減排日主義問題發生時、亦須以外交方式處理之、關於軍事協定問題、必項與外交當局澈底討論、本人甚望陸相繼續努力更嚴厲之肅軍云、（中央社十六日電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］今日下院討論事項幾全屬中日兩國之問題、各議員對於華北走私問題、台灣基隆事件、日本人民在中國私販毒物以及日本永遠租借地問題等、均陸逐提出質問、首由保守黨議員摩廉要求對於華北走私情形加以概述、外次克蘭波答稱、據最近之數字、走私貨物之數量及價值、均已在逐漸喊少之中、摩廉復請會衆注意最近之報告、謂近三月之中、走私貨物由日人保護通過中國稅關者、共一千五百載重車、克蘭波答稱、政府方面對於走私均極關懷、但數量與價值、均已減少、摩廉繼復提及中國之抵押債欵事、克蘭波稱、彼正待許閣森大使之報告云、</p>
<p>繼工黨議員佛萊轍復提出中國毒物私運問題、外次克蘭波稱、英駐華領事館人員及其他官員、對於日本人民私運毒物入華問題、均按時供給消息、此等消息、即隨時送達國聯雅片顧問委員會英代表、聽其採取有效及應有之辦法、至消息之公佈與否、則由國際決定之、據彼所知、該委員會開會之程序及報告、均已隨時公佈、佛萊轍復稱、近據多種之情況報告、日本當局到於日本人民之運販毒品、有積極鼓勵之事實、克蘭波答稱、英政府對於此問題之全部、均在考慮之中云、</p>
<p>保守黨議員凱塞繼起質問、關於取消英國人民在日本商埠置有永遠租借地產一事、前經英大使克萊武向日本政府提出對案之後、已否成立、英國租地人委員會可認為滿意之解決辦法、克蘭波稱、現已依照英大使提出之對案、成立解決辦法、並謂英大使與日外相之間、不日即將對於此事、調換文件云、</p>
<p>關於基隆事件、外次查理士爵士稱、該案現尚未有解決辦法、查基隆事件發生於去年十月七日、據云有英水兵三名及英官佐一名、在台灣基隆受侮辱、惟英駭日大使及日外租正在積極討論該事云、（中央社十五日路透社電）</p>

<p>吳鶴齡已由長春返西旗　李守信部將西開嘉卜寺</p>
<p>張北通信、察北偽軍自改編一軍一師之後、各在防地分別加緊訓練、惟邇來就其調動運輸情形上觀察、似又有轉趨積極之勢、某方過去策動匪偽、即慣用聲東擊西閃爍莫明之技倆、故其情勢、時是沉悶與緊張之象、不過其最近目的、究竟何在、現在尚未敢臆斷、據近來所知者、德王於本月初、曾派其親信吳鶴齡代表赴長春向某軍部陳商強化偽組織問題、迨吳抵長春後、適逢其軍部參謀長正在新奮調換、吳乃滯留長春、至本月十二日、吳始由長春乘飛機返抵嘉卜寺、時德王因其母祀期、已先到西蘇民特旗、吳下機後、由歡迎者口中得悉此訊、即乘原機轉飛西旗、觀其行色忽忽、其對於強化偽組織事、當有重大意義、故急急要向德王報告也、</p>
<p>又據康保訊、本月十二日夜間、偽蒙古軍獨立團胡竇山部、有百餘人突然携械譁變、向東逃竄、至其譁變原因、係某方以胡部軍心不穩、恐醖釀日久、成為巨變、乃令胡實行縮編、並擬乘機將該部繳械遣散、詎未及發、巳為胡之部下所悉、故先期譁變、所發之新式槍械、均全付携走、胡寶山亦深知部下動搖、又以時在夜間、故未放窮追、遂任其從容逃逸、</p>

<p>增進生產創造工廠　省營工業積極改善</p>
<p>廣州通信、廣東建設應長劉維熾、日前晋京出席三中全會、並商洽關於粵省各項建設計劃之進行、旋於日昨返粵、此後劉氏對於建設措施、必更有新的規劃、茲據劉氏談述、甚爲詳晰、爰略紀如次、</p>
<p>建設工業計劃</p>
<p>關於發展粵省工業、應集中力量於於基本工業、於國防有關係者、亦認真辦理、尢注重繼續以前各工廠合同、（如鋼鐵廠等）俾得於短期內、開始實際工作、關於鋼鐵廠之進行、本人經一面催促英國巴利寶公司、將最後關於技術之報告、送呈政府審核施行、一面設法籌款、履行應付欵項、</p>
<p>推進農業生產</p>
<p>現正從新建設一規模宏偉之肥田料廠、該新廠產量額、定每年最少五萬噸、使與現時浦口永和硫酸亞廠比美、廣東內地農業、需用多屬氮肥、照以前統計、最高每年銷至一百六十萬擔、近年來廣東農業生產、已不如前、故所需肥料、較前為少、如經過一度整理、推進生產、則所需肥田料較多、不惟可以獲回原狀、更可超過日前最高銷額、現有之肥田料廠、每年產額不過一萬噸、將來連同新廠產品、總額亦不過六萬噸、仍不敷供給廣東一省之用、該廠所需原料、除機器向外國購買外、概取給於本省、該廠建筑費、需欵約一千萬至一千二百萬港幣、關於籌妝辦法與外商合資經營、此項辦法、已具體化、不日即可提出省府會議、討論施行、</p>
<p>供給廉價動力</p>
<p>廣東號稱良好之農業區、同時亦為一良好之工業區、所以一面推進農業、一面亦須推進工業、然後經濟可期發展、工業發展、最需要者為廉價的“原動力”、成本始可減輕、欲得有廉價的“原動力”、必需採用水力電、關於水電廠之建築、數年前政府亦一度提議、倘照從前辦法、政府須籌有鉅欵、始可着手進行現時財政狀況、比前不同、如事事必須備有巨額現欵、則勢所不能、故必須利用人民資本、或外國資本、以資興辦、現在該廠籌欵辦法、亦係興外商合贊經營、至於第一步計劃、為從新將原有翁江水電廠廠址加以測量、對於雨量、尤應調查清楚、假使當地雨量充足、即可進行、該廠發電額、經定每年為五萬至七萬五千基羅弗打、（弗打又稱烟爾為電力單位）、建築欵項、約需一千五百萬至二千萬元港幣、假使此計劃實現，則大約三年內、全部工程、可告完成、</p>
<p>籌辦人造絲廠</p>
<p>除上述各項基本工業外、現擬籌辦人造絲廠一間、人造絲雖為銷費工業、亦與國防極有關係、以我國之大、竟無一人造絲廠、殊可慚愧、現經與外商磋商、合資經營一中等產量之人造絲廠、每日出產至少三噸、方法採用木漿為原料、需欵連同流動資金、約四百萬元、此種計劃、已在積極進行中、不日常可陸續發表、</p>
<p>發展瓊崖問題</p>
<p>關於發展海南計劃、現經宋委員長（子文）擬有整個計劃、此外並有其他辦法、各項辦法、均在商權中、大約進行步驟、一方面推動人民自行經營、一方面借用外資、雙方並進比較容易、對於發展瓊崖、最關心最感興趣之宋委員長與孫院長（科）、并擬於短期內南下、前往視察、大約經過各方面努力推進之後、發展瓊崖之根本計劃、必有相當解決、</p>
<p>整理省營工業</p>
<p>關於今後省營工業之整理辦法、迭經擬具方案、因為省營工業、完全為營業機關、故必先設法使之商業化、始能持久、政府對於辦理工業方針、曾經表示、凡屬於輕工業性質之工廠、均可由人民自行辦理、即使現正完成之省營工廠、如人民願意承辦、即可隨時讓與、俾人民對於工業建設、有充份參加之機會、亦即實行推進國民經濟建設之方法、以後關於改善工廠辦法、亟應注意之點有二、㊀愼選精幹廉潔之人負責辦理、俾社會上對於各工廠實際狀況、充份明瞭、㊁對於各工廠之組織、使其十二分嚴密、俾可事先防止弊賽、由此做去、可一掃除從前外間之誤會、</p>

<h3>告日本經濟考察團諸君</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>日本經濟考察團來華考察經濟，吾人就國貨界立塲，為該團諸君子進一言：</p>
<p>第一該團當知中國國貨界年來之竭蹶經營，幸未遭受澌滬者，賴國內人民一致愛國之熱忱，與我工業界自身之努力奮斗，吾國工商界，與日本工商業實無衝突，實無妨害，希望日本工商界不必嫉忌，不必害怕，須知吾國工商業之求出路，亦即為求生存，求生之念，為人類所固有，一國之注意民族工業，即為一國民族求生存之基礎，日本如此，中國亦如此，苟出以恕道，事事為對方着想，则决無間題矣。</p>
<p>第二要求出品之得人歡迎，受人樂用，第一當使對方有好感，有信念。苟日日予人以難堪之事，給人以惡劣之印象，而欲對方愿意用我出品，天下决無此理。故考察團諸吾見到此點，還是從改正政治方面着手。在政治未有相當解決以前，中日貿易，無論如何說法，總是不會有圓滿結果的。</p>
<p>第三中國工商界所最痛心的，為走私。現在走私的情形，在華北還是沒有歛跡，而日本政府，依然未加取締，此種辦法，何異斵喪中國工商命脈，以制工商界於死命。此而不改，任何經濟提携，總是談不到。而且長此下去，隱忍復隱忍，必有不能隱忍的一天，很替中國貿易前途躭憂。希望考察團諸君回國以後，趕快報告政府趕快改正，這種不正當不合理的行爲。</p>
<p>吾人以考察團諸君均為日本經濟界領袖，而極明瞭中國情狀，又為中日人望之所歸，故敢率直言之，願鑒其愚忱而採納之。</p>
<h3>國醫節與提倡國藥運動</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>今天三月十七日，是中國國醫節。全國國醫公會，以及各地中醫協會，都召集紀念大會，以示慶祝。這在我們中國的醫藥史上，誠然是值得記載的一頁，不容我們的忽視的。</p>
<p>不過，當過全國國醫界，在今天紀念國醫節的時候，筆者却有一些感想，覺得我們提倡國貨，除了在衣食服用，以及其他一切生活的所需，都應該以購辦國貨為自標以外，對於國藥，也應該切實的提倡和服用。一方面固然是保存我國的國粹，同時，也可以減少些外貿醫藥的進口數額，而為民族經濟，增加幾分奮鬥的實力與元氣，這才是廣義的提倡國貨運動呢。</p>
<p>目前，我們中國的國藥業，經過了醫藥界的努力，已經得到迅速的進展，這是毋庸我們諱言的。現在，我們得更進一步的除了保存中國的國粹之外，（即湯煎的國藥）對於著名的國貨工廠，如五洲大藥房所發明的人造自來血，新亞製藥廠最近創製的補使命，中西大藥房的各種魚肝油，中法大藥房的艾羅補腦汁，愛華製藥社的實驗保賢固精丸等等，也應該盡量的提倡與服用，要知道，這不是筆者在這裏替這些國貨工廠作義務的宣傳，實際上，他們的出品，早巳給社會人土留下一個深刻的良好的而永永不會磨減的印象了。</p>
<p>總而言之，我們在今夫紀念國醫節，希望國醫界在自己本業的實質上，予以進一步的研究，並在可能範圍之內，替一般可憐而無告的窮苦病家，多多的加以憫恤。同時，更希望全國同胞，對於上面所介紹的幾種第一洗的國貨藥品，尤須儘量的購服與宣傳，莫把大好金錢，去購置舶來醫藥，置民族經濟難關於不顧，而甘心做一個外貨的推銷員，這是筆者在今天國醫師，所發生的感想質諸高明，以寫何如？</p>
<h3>貨真價實</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>“貨真價實”，這是我國商塲中的、－句俗話，也可以說是一句經營商業的“金玉良言”。因為，凡是一月商店，能夠“貨真價實”的，那麽，它的營業，一定是發達的。否則，便難免營業不振，而至於“倒𥦡！”由此講來，這一句“貨真價實”，謂為經營商業的“金玉良言”，誰能否認？</p>
<p>如今我覺得在這大家熱烈提倡“國貨”的時候，一方面雖很熱心的在那裏購買“國貨”，但，一方面却在那裏“利令智昏”的把“舶來品”改頭換面，以冒充“國貨！”像這種事情，我們是常有所聞，不能說是“絕無僅有”。</p>
<p>我們要知道以“洋貨”而冒充“國貨”，便不能說是“貨真”。至於售價方面，則既然是以“洋貨”冒充的，勢必仍照“洋貨”的原來的價格出售。換句話說，便是究竟“洋貨”貴於“國貨”，斷不會因冒充爲“國貨”，而也改低其原來的價格。那麽，既冒充為“國貨”，而不改照“國貨”的相當價格出售，這便不能說是“價實！”唯其是這樣，“貨”既不“真”，“價”又不“實”，結果，不但使自己的營業，終必失敗。並且還足以使“國貨”的信譽，也受了影響！我想：“國貨”事業發達之滯遲，這也未始不是一種最大的原因！</p>
<p>所以，我要寫這篇“貨真價實”，無非是要希望一般國貨廠商，要知所自勉。不可以非“國貨”朦混，欺騙顧客，而使真正“國貨”的價格，也還有不實之嫌。總之，經營商業，要“貨真價實”，尤其是經營“國貨”的商業，更加要“貨真價實”！</p>
<h3>公務員國貨年之國貨筆墨紙張（上）</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>今年，是被定為公務員國貨年了，希望全國的公務人員，都明瞭自己的天職，自己的責任；來努力提倡國貨，服用國貨，我想：公務人員都是知識階級，對於自己的天職，是不會忘却的，所以公務員國貨年裏，一定可以有比較豐滿的收穫。筆者忝為公務人員之一份子，謹以此自勉，兼勉全國的公務人員。</p>
<p>寫中國字，自然要用中國筆，中國墨，中國紙張；可是有些公務員們，却歡喜採用舶來品。不過這裏面也有些分別，有的是明知故用，有的是不知誤用；前者其罪較大，後者則可加原諒，並且在實際上。更以後者爲較多，所以行政院特地調查了一個各機關通用物品的國貨清冊，以便各機關知所選購。現在轉介紹到後面，希望全國公務人員，男女學生，以及工商各界一體注意，共相提倡服用，以挽回漏扈：以振與國貨。</p>
<p>（甲）鉛筆類　㊀中國標準粉筆廠，廠址在上海斜徐路二七六號，商標是鼎牌和飛機牌，每年出道一萬五千羅，至四萬五千羅。行銷遍全國為潘公展等所辦，曾發給國貨證明書，足可代表外貨。㊁華文鉛筆廠，在上海保定路樹豐北里，商標是飛燕牌，每年出産十餘萬羅，行銷上海及國內各埠。曾發給國貨證明書；足可代替外貨。㊂大華鉛筆廠，廠址在香港九龍城內，商標是雙箭牌和地球牌，每年出産十萬羅，曾發給國貨證明書，足可替代外貨。</p>
<p>（乙）油墨　㊀金城工藥廠，在上海金神父路新新里，出品是墨汁顔料，商標為金字圓形的老廳，每年出産十萬打，價值五萬元。銷路遍全國及南洋羣島，曾經過工廠登記。㊁靈生公司，在上海天通庵路四十七號，出品印刷五彩油舉商標是駱鴕牌，每年出產四十萬磅，價值六萬四千餘元。行銷全國，經過工廠登記。㊂通文油墨社，在上海海寗路•商標為三連理，每年出產八萬磅，價值六萬元，行銷滬漢京杭各埠，經過工廠登記。㊃同盛油墨廠，在上海茄勒路一六四弄四號，製造五彩油墨，每年出産七萬磅，價值六萬元，行銷全國，經過工廠登記。㊄公盛油墨廠，廠址上海庫倫路南公益里四十七號，商標為星牌及三星牌。每年出産四十萬六千三百磅，價值十八萬六千餘元，行銷全國，經過工廠登記。㊅公華五彩油墨廠在上海寶源路九十六號，商標爲勞工牌，每年出産七萬二千磅，價值五萬七千六百元，行銷全國經過工廠登記。㊆利豐五彩油墨廠，廠址在上海閘北廳倫路德生里五十六號，每年出產二萬餘磅，價值三萬餘元，行銷京滬等埠，經過工廠登記。㊇天利油墨廠，在上海泗涇路，經過公司登記。㊈中原油墨廠，在上海雲山路九二四號，經過公司登記。㊉天然製墨廠，廠址上海閘北宋公園路二○一號，出品墨汁，墨水。商標八角形內天然標凖，爲機製洋貨。</p>
<h3>推銷淺說(四)</h3>
<p>— 定凱</p>
<p>㊁推銷還得需要的調查及統計工作</p>
<p>推銷的勝利，既然屬於心理的分析，而市塲方面的調查與分析，也應有雙管齊下的必要。這問題很為明顯。因為前者屬於臆斷與預測，後者屬於事實與證據，據作者的意見，一個規模稍具的公司或工廠。至少須搜羅下列的幾種材料。</p>
<p>(甲）各地交通運輸的狀況（要分國內及國外的南洋羣島）</p>
<p>（乙）對象貨物行銷狀態的調查（舶來品與同類品並重）</p>
<p>（丙）行銷的經濟狀况及消費狀况並及生活方面的動態。</p>
<p>（丁）客幫辦貨狀况的調查。</p>
<p>（戊）逐年營業方面的統計圖表。</p>
<p>作者為了研究推銷，又常常去訪問國貨工廠的當局。或者受着國貸廠商的諮詢。我總是擘口就問“又有業務上參考的材料看了麽”但是接觸着的許多工廠。可以說什不得一，甚至認調查統計為無謂的耗費。反觀外商方面的注意我們商情上的動態。得一消息，如吉光片羽似的，不但駐華的商務官。以政府的立塲，在情報工作上去幫助本國工廠的諮詢，甚且有不遠千里而來的工廠駐華代表。他們一面是推銷貨品一面也在採訪情報，可見知己知彼，然後方能百戰百勝呢。</p>
<h3>國貨訪問應換路綫的商榷</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>貢獻給國貨運動會與訪問諸女士</p>
<p>古語：“但問耕耘，莫問收獲，”含有用一分精神，得一分事業的意義國貨運動的歷史，也有二十餘年了到現在方始燦爛光大生氣蓬勃可見事在人為但問耕耘，莫問收穫，的確寓有深意的。國貨女訪問員工作的努力深印在吾們的腦海，故仰堯先生，在其“貢獻話”文裏，證明“國貨訪問對於國貨事業的發展上確有莫大的助力！</p>
<p>可是筆者，還有一些管見，貢獻給國貨運動委負會諸公和國貨訪問員諸女士之前的，就是訪問的路綫，應速改換，大家知道，上海西區，是貴族化家庭，或者洋化家庭的所謂高等華人集中區購買力最大消費洋貨最鉅訪問勸導改用國貨，固不容緩然而滬東區，雖說是工廠膩域，也有不少的家庭住宅，在平凉路，榆林路，船朋路，楊樹浦路一帶，更是男，女，工人的羣衆密集處，他們對於國貨印象，更加薄弱因為人多的緣故，消費力也很足驚人我們愛護國貨的同志們實在不願意他們以汗血勞力換得的錢，替洋貨做推銷員，送錢給外人用。吾以為訪問諸女士，應速計劃改換路綫，到滬東區一帶來訪問，努力中下階級的國貨指導，勿過分忽視那許多勞苦大衆的家庭，却也很足以影響國貨前途的，這是筆者寫斯文的動機，希望商權之後獲得實現！</p>
<h3>第一流國貨的生產與消費者</h3>
<p>— 秋郞</p>
<p>本年號稱公務員國貨年，凡是為公務員的，應特別為國貨努力，所以本市吳市長和潘社會局長，因站在首領的地位，為使一般公務員及民衆，對於國貨，應有更深切的認識起見，吳市長親筆特題“推認第一流國貨”數字，以資提倡和介紹，這是很使我們敬佩的不邊肇者對此，却有兩點徹意，用敢摘錄於下，㊀全國各大國貿工廠，應對於裂貨方面，務求美觀耐用，出貨迅速，而定價方面，更當力求低廢，如是既增進購者的信仰，營業自然發展，而符第一流國貨的美稱。㊁消費的民衆，鑒及本國既有精美而又價廉的第一流國貿，自然應該盡力的提倡藥用，絕對不宜再去購買外貸而且更無購外貨之必要，庶幾生產與消費兩方，真誠合作起來，我可確定入超的數字，就能逐漸減少，而至消減，國計民生，自然可以日趨富裕了。</p>

<h3>現代政治與中國（續）</h3>
<p>— 君山</p>
<p>在今天的國家，無論它外表是民主或是君主，而其實質則不外是法治與黨治，這一事實又說明了：無論今天何種國家，都離不開羣治政治興領袖政治。此話怎樣講？因為今天整個的世界僅有六十二個國家，三十七個國家是共和，二十五個是王國。而我們平常時時見到的又只有八個大國，就是：英吉利，美利堅，日本，蘇俄，法蘭西，意大利，土耳其，德意志。所以不再看其他國家政治形態和政治實質怎樣，即以此八個大國做代表就可看出一切。各位要曉得：全世界共有十八萬萬到十萬萬人口•這八個國家便統治了十一萬萬人口，—要是加上中國，便有十五萬萬以上的人口，所以，我們以此做代表，是能夠得到近代整個世界政治真相的、在八個大國裏，有的是民主共和，有的還是君主立憲，可是無論他們外形是君主也好，民主也好，他們政治的實質不是羣治政治便是領袖政治。比如在君主國家中，英日為羣治政治，——政黨政治，也即是多黨政治，而意大利則為領袖政治，——一黨政治，但我們如果又來看民主國家，這裏面也同樣的產生了羣治政治和領袖政治，像美國同法國，這是民主政治下的羣治政治：而俄國同德國則又是民主政治下的領袖政治。因此，我們可以從這兩種大不相同的政治形態裏找到一樣的羣治政治和領袖政治，——民主政治可以產生羣治政治和領袖政治，君主政治也同樣產生羣治政治和領袖政治。這就說明了，近代政治無君主民主之分，只有羣治政治與領袖政治之別：也即是多黨政治輿一黨政治的區別。什麽叫做多黨政治呢？就是很多政黨來相互消長地管理一國政治，什麽叫做、黨政治呢？就是一個國家只有一個政黨來管理政治。我們了解這個意義，即了解世界政治的傾向，這是非常重要的。</p>

<h3>靠</h3>
<p>— （陳天賜）</p>
<p>“在家靠父母，岀外靠朋友。”“靠山吃山，靠水吃水。”</p>
<p>這兩句話，是流行我國民間的俗語，可是細想起來，這些話根本是錯的，為什麽呢？</p>
<p>因為“在家靠父母，”如果他的父母死了，那去靠誰呢？“岀外靠朋友，”如果他的朋友，不去提拔他，或是不去理他，那又去靠什麽人呢？</p>
<p>“靠山吃山，靠水吃水。”那更不對的，假使他没有一種專門的技倆，憑什麽去靠山吃山，靠水吃水。</p>
<p>現在我國民族性的如此落後，對於這兩句成語，一定受有相當的影響，致養成一種倚賴性，而無奮鬥的能力。</p>
<p>總之，我們要謀處身社會，鞏固地位，祗有自己去努力，奮鬥，創造，去學成一項專門的技倆，對於這虚無的“靠”，是没有用的，朋友們！起來罷，光明的前途，就在我們的目前，等待着我們去開闢啊！</p>
<h3>傅作義將軍印象記</h3>
<p>— 白夏</p>
<p>綏遠的剿匪軍共分路：第一路軍司人官是傳作義將軍，他的任務是保衛綏北興綏西的安全，同時傅將軍又是剿匪軍的總指揮，綏遠抗敵的一切權力都掌握在他的手裏，可說是綏邊第一重要的人物。</p>
<p>筆者到綏遠去，住在綏垣唯一的綏遠飯店裏。當日曾到省政府的交際組訪楊組長，請他介紹拜見傳將軍。楊組長說：“傅主席今日因有要公，不能見客，你的名刺留在這裏，明天主席有空時才通知你。”到了第二天下午四時左右，筆者從外邊回飯店，侍役對我說：“省府的招待處主任剛才派了一部汽車來接你去省府，你却不在飯店。”我聽電話之後，立即打了一個電話給招待處主任，問他傅主席尚在省府否？回話是說：“已經到總指揮部去了。但主席今晚在綏遠飯店宴客，你先生也在被請之例，今晚不是就可晤面了嗎？”把電話筒掛上之後，回到房間裏，果然發見一張請帖在桌上。</p>
<p>到前綫來慰勞的代表，和來採訪戰地新聞的記者們，照例會給傳將軍請吃一頓西洋大菜的。這晚上被請的有華僑慰勞代表，反正的匪軍政治部長，剿匪軍第三路司令官李服膺女公子，跟筆者等共約十餘人。傅將軍是準六時就到綏遠飯店的餐室。這樣一位全國所欽佩的民族英雄，筆者與他見面的最初，不用說是滿心充塞着欣喜的情緒的。可是傅將軍在這天晚上却脫下了戎服，只穿着一件黑布面的皮袍，上襟還插着一支派克自來水筆。看模樣不像一位將軍，倒像是一位大學教授。</p>
<p>傅將軍的熊度非常之悠閒，和藹。最初給人家的印象，就是一位極可親近的長者一樣。當他指着李小姐對我們說：“現在的時代已不同了，這樣十七八歲的女孩子已經蟯得愛國，冒着風雪到百靈廟去慰勞，什麽也不怕，這真是我們想不到的事，我自己像這麽大的年紀時，一聽到‘戰爭’兩字早就害怕了，那有這麽大的膽量。”這時候，傳將軍却又變成一位鄉間的父老一樣，充滿着誠忱可愛的情感。</p>
<p>自這一次宴會之後，與傅將軍見面的時候更多了。特別是綏垣舉行防空大會的那一天，在小較塲的司令台上，這位和藹的長者，却一變而爲雄糾糾的將軍了。不但那套灰色的軍服使他顯得英勇偉大，就是那嘹亮的聲音，那果敢的言詞，那慷慨激昂的態度，在在都顯出他是一位不可侵犯的民族英雄哩！</p>
<h3>鶉鬬</h3>
<p>— 立平</p>
<p>鵪鶉形如雞離，短腳禿尾，灰褐色，有黑色斑紋。白天匿草叢裏面，不能高飛，捕鵪鶉者在白天，用鴿子去捕，但，一到晚間，鵪鶉就能高飛於天空，所以都用綱來捕。不過雄的很少，一百之間，祇有幾隻是雄的。雄鶉善鬥，往往門的時候可以支持到兩小時，所以湘西一帶居民以此為最普通的游戲及賭博。</p>
<p>當雄鶉捉回來，並不用籠蓄，却是裝在一種用圓木片作底的布袋裏懸在床頭，出外就掖在腰帶上，新捕的鵪鶉因太肥的緣故，不能就鬥。所以每天祇飼食三次，吃的是粟等。吃飽以後，用熱濃茶給它洗一個澡，洗後，等它羽毛乾後，就又藏進布袋裏去，這樣半月以後，又健又瘦，這隻鵪鶉上戰塲是夠資格了。</p>
<p>未鬥之前，蓄鶉者同對方講明一切，於是擇形狀相當體力相等的，放到鶉門塲裏——一個矮矮的竹籬圈子，便進退盤旋，鬥個不停，鬥的時候，有利啄啄對方，或用翅捎來搏擊。好點的鵪鶉，都可以鬥得千啄左右，大約有二小時之久，才能分勝負。據說鵪鶉專家，一望能知鶴鶉的優劣，大約要啄利，翅健，目有精光，額平如燕為佳。而鵪鶉敗了一次以後，就不能再鬥，除非是特別優良的，才只能調養以後再鬥，否則，隨手摔死，當作食品。</p>
<h3>稀后墓</h3>
<p>— 陶康君</p>
<p>的確，這倒是一種很有力量的傳說，深刻地印在每個南京人的腦膜上，所以我們時常會聽到一種歌謠式的諺語：到“挖氏稀娘娘墳，能發半個南京城，”流行在每個南京人的口頭上，這是多末富有誘惑性喲！無疑的，它是抓住着人們的思想，打動了人們的心弦。</p>
<p>不錯，據金陵雜記上說，梁武帝后稀氏是葬在南岡之東，婁湖頭之旁，根據這點記載，我們就可以曉得稀后墓是鄰於古城腳下的了。</p>
<p>婁湖頭旁並沒有蒼老的古樹，繁茂的森林，然而有的是荒塚纍纍的土堆，滿目淒涼的枯草，但墓稀后墓之名往遊者，却無從問律，而好事者更無從去尋覓了</p>
<p>數年前，該地土農因久旱不雨，所以藉挖塘之說，聚集了幾十個人，一致地抱着發財的希望，幹着他們的開發工作，但是費了一個多月的光陰，只得到花紋古磚九萬餘方，其他是一無所見，這却令他們感到了很大的失望。</p>
<p>據父老言：此墓之工程極爲浩大，其所用之糯米汁，竟至數千餘担之夥，就是發現了真實的墓基，恐亦望洋與歎，無能爲力。</p>
<p>最近該處已增闢一雨花門了，以便京蕪路聯運的需要，所以往昔的荒凉氣象，却已粉飾了不少，然而我們在那兒經過的時候，這神秘的稀后墓，又佔據了我們的心頭。</p>

<h3>許大使歸國記</h3>
<p>— 六郎</p>
<p>去年之三月六日，許靜仁大使由滬買棹東來，今年之三月六日適逢許氏請假歸國述職，在此短短的一年中。此和藹慈祥之雙谿老人，（許氏別號）實已廣播其美好之情感於此間中外人士。</p>
<p>猶憶許氏去歲抵東時，正值日本於二二六事變之後，陰霾滿布，雨雪紛飛，氣候之寒，人人有瑟縮之感；而今歲則櫻花含苞，春暖三島，一若象徵許氏之苦鬥經年，已將中國冬眠時期之外交，引進至春意霍然之另一階段。</p>
<p>聞許氏東來，初非所願，蓋彼深恐語言文字之隔閡，不能發揮其經綸以折衝樽俎，實則駐日之各國大公使，亦正復與許氏同病相憐，無有能直按與木屐兒郎作⾆戰者。</p>
<p>許氏之待人接物，輒虛心坦懷，一本其恂恂然若不及之態度，誠可謂為一冲然積厚，胸有千秋之人。其於日本之一切問題，研究尤不遺餘力，舉凡日本報章雜誌，以及有價值之著述，恒由其左右為之譯成中文，許氏不僅翻閱一過而已，必詳加穿點，一字不遺，且日以為常，歷久不懈。故許氏在日僅一年，而其對於日本之政治，經濟，軍事，國防，以迄乎人情習尚，莫不周密知微，雖居日數十年之日本通，亦望塵莫及焉。</p>
<p>我國留日學生，居於東京者，不下數千人，聞許之和藹可親，輒思一承顔色以爲榮，故每日求見者踵相接，而許氏亦來者不拒，慰勉有加，苟有一技之長者，甚且不恥下問，因之青年學子，無論其思想為左為右，莫不一致愛戴，目之為許聖人。如前此被人詆爲別有背景之學生聯合會，會中除桌椅數事外，四壁蕭然，既無黨國旗，亦無總理遺像，惟於牆壁之中央，高懸一大幅之許氏照相，亦足見其對許氏崇敬之一斑矣。</p>
<p>自許氏歸國之消息傳出後，各方為其設宴祖餞者，甚至在同一日之內多至十數起，許氏無術分身，往往顧此失彼，聞有某日人，特張盛筵於某大酒樓，而唯恐許氏或不及至，竟自駕摩托卡，追逐於許氏汽車之後，轉輾各處，待至夜深人靜，最後乃刦許以去，是亦可謂請客中之至誠朋友也。</p>
<p>六日午后一時四十分，許氏自東京驛出發，送別者萬頭攢擁，冠蓋如雲，林首相，佐藤外相及結城藏相之代表，及前外務大臣芳澤謙吉，有田八郎，前駐德大使小幡西吉，前駐華大使有吉明，情報部長天羽英一等及當世各方名士，多至不可勝記，其情况之熱烈，實為從來所未有。在羣賢畢集之中，有一特別之珍客，頗為一般人土所注意，不可不走筆記之，珍客面容憔悴，步履蹣跚，着長袍，衣馬褂，足登平底朝鞋，頭戴瓜皮小帽，帽之上復綴以大紅之結，頻頻拱其雙手與許氏為證，不知者猶以為此公或係我國之失意官僚，逐跡於海外者，實則乃”不折不扣之大和民族之聞人，而稱為中國通之後藤朝太郎先生。</p>
<p>東京驛歡送之幕方終，繼之而展間者，為橫濱輪埠之盛况，東京之華僑及留學生，趕往橫濱送行者極衆，及與橫濱之僑胞會合後，人數益多，聲勢益壯。橫濱中華商會之中國青年團團員均一律穿着制服，排立碼頭，向許氏致敬，三呼萬歲之後，復大唱其黨歌，衆皆隨聲附和，響遏雲霄，最滑稚者為一部份粵省之留日同學，因苦於粵語之不能申逵下情，遂仰首船頭，高呼“馬達依賴寫兮”不置。（請再來之意）許氏亦報以“多麽阿里阿多，”（謝謝之意）聞者哄然，迨鐘嗚八下，汽笛、聲，許氏遂乘風破浪而去，隨許氏同歸者共八人，該諧者，稱為八仙飄海云。</p>
<h3>記者談話</h3>
<p>— （勞燕）</p>
<p>關於妻病的故事</p>
<p>前幾天我曾在本欄中，寫過關於申報記者黃寄萍君，因為他的尊人患貧血病，服“自來血”痊愈的故事。黃君還繼續和我談過一段話，現在我也然䤸於後：</p>
<p>黃君說：前三個年頭，我的內人忽然患了吐血症，經過中西名醫診治，血是止了，可是多痰多咳，肺氣還是不足！一位西醫勸她多服“乳白魚肝油”，可使肺氣增進，助長體力，醫生的話，當然唯命是聽。我們買的“乳白魚肝油”，也是五洲藥房的出品，初服時稍覺不慣，久服也就慣了，每餐勿停的連服兩年，算起瓶數，至少在三十以上，果然氣血十分充足，身體和從前一樣，而且頑健得多了。…………………………”</p>
<p>（筆者按）良藥能痊活人病，像黃君的尊人，夫人，都是得到良藥的利惠。其實像五洲出品的精良，社會上有不少的家庭受到它的利惠，黃君不過是其中之一罷了。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回（絮語感慈幃懺情殉孝秋光黯翠黛觸景書懷）</p>
<p>他和國器，正是意氣相投。今日穿了一件藍鏡面呢的夾袍子，頭髮梳得烏亮。鼻子上架起托力克的眼鏡，倒是一種丯致翩翩的人物。國器紅了臉道：你怎麽不聲不嚮的就進來了。小松笑道：這幾首詩，作的很不壞，我看言之有物，决不是向壁虚造的。國器笑道：你這人作事有點不對。小松道：你不用問我這事作的對與不對。我倒要問你，你這詩是作好了，預備刋在你小説稿子裏用的呢？還是作了就算，並不發表的呢？國器道：我當然是要發表的。小松且不追問，又把桌上的詩稿拿到手上捧起來，又高聲朗誦了一遍，點頭笑道：當時相見柳姗姗，落盡梧桐一語難，這位先生太没有勇氣，相見了這樣久，怎麽還不能够通話呢？每日百忙還小立，背人遥看綠環低，興致不淺。這遥字爲什麽不用偷字，難道還是正大光明的看了去嗎？最後一首，説到坐對秋花一剪寒，都簡直是你現身説法了。你看你這桌上。説着，指了瓶子裏的菊花，向國器微笑。國器把那詩稿奪過來，立刻送到抽屜裏去，將抽屜給關上，笑道：這裏又没有第三個人，互相標榜着給誰聽這些話？小松坐到椅子上，微偏了頭，依然沉吟着，笑道：這一定言之有物，我來和你幾首，好不好，國器坐在他斜對面，昂頭看了窗子外的天空，也帶些微笑。小松輕輕的拍了掌道據我看來一定是你的本事詩，你……國器笑着向他拱拱手，又向墻那邊章老太的屋子所在指了幾指。小松就低聲道：依着我揣測，你遇到了這種事，一定是感到相當困難的。你何不把實在的情形告訴我，我也可以同你想點主意。至低的程度，我也要辦到你兩人可以説話。我想這位小姐一定也是個詩人罷。黄花插鬚，一個人在西風落照前散歩，慢説是本人，就是我讀了這詩，也覺得意境惘然。何况你又説的是瘦損雙蛾畫不濃，不見胭脂見淚痕的人呢。國器被他訽得有些情不自禁了，却低低的歎了一口氣。他這一歎，不啻給予了小松一種暗示，告訴他所猜是對了。小松是個好事的少年，豈肯放過不問呢？這事情是不免透出一點消息來了。（一四六）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>工人墮浦</h3>
<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>碼頭上的工人英語譯音是“苦力”，照字面講，果然是音義皆同，比Humor譯做“幽默”更來得切當。但是西洋人呌“苦力”的本意，不但因為他們是“苦”於“力”的工人，並有藐視這輩終日喊着杭唷杭唷底仁兄們的下劣。</p>
<p>本來，“勞心者治人，勞力者治於人”，中國亦有明訓，既做了“苦力”，唯恐有“力”無處“苦”，“下劣”與“優秀”，他們是無暇及此的。</p>
<p>然而“苦力”中也有“優秀份子”，昨日本報載：“法租界外灘金利源碼頭有小工江北人名何鳳瑞者，忽因細故與工頭楊某互毆，詎結果何竟被楊擊落浦中，待同伴趕到打撈，但何已隨波臣失蹤，而楊某知肇鉅禍，竟於紛糾聲中遁去………”</p>
<p>這裏有一點疑問，死了一個小工，調查得清清楚楚曰“何鳳瑞”，這是興歷來各項新聞中傷（或死）小工某等數十人所不同的，而那個擊入落浦的工頭反簡稱“楊某”，如果不是訪員先生故弄玄虛，“工頭楊某”就有別於一般“普通苦力”了。</p>
<p>又曰“因細故互毆”，所謂“細故”，大概是“一言不合”，不過當場無人見證，無從判斷是非，就“擊落浦中”和“紛糾聲中遁去”而論，那些“趕到”的“同伴”們，也把“何鳳瑞”與“楊某”有所分別了；雖然事後“當經人投報捕房核辦”。辦些什麽，那是後事了。</p>
<p>不久之前，讀到一篇紗廠的“報告文學”，那個呌做“那馬溫”的也是以“優秀份子”的姿態兀立於普通搖紗女工之前的，由此推測，即是做了最“下劣”的工人，能夠做到“頭”，也可以在同類面前顯一顯“優秀”的威風的。</p>
<p>不過，不要忽略了洋大人和買辦們之所以施特別權利於“工頭”的理由，抄一段“電影的教訓”的話吧：“但當白色英雄探險菲洲時，却常有黑色的忠僕來給他開路，服役，拚死，替死，使主子安然的回家。”</p>
<p>現在，誰是“優秀份子”，即使做到了“工頭”與“那馬溫”，充其量也不過是“打腫面孔充胖子”而已。</p>
<h3>風箏</h3>
<p>— 魯平</p>
<p>為了一點小事情，終於又被逼迫着跑回了鄉下來，因此又看見了風箏。</p>
<p>在我的幼年，每年的春天，只要一近清明時節，在故鄉的山坡上，總會聚集着許多年齡相仿的孩子，携着各式各樣的紙鳶和綫球，到這兒來放着。大家都起勁地比賽，誰的鳶子漂亮，誰的大，誰的放得最高，好勝心是充滿在每一個天真孩子的小心靈裏面。</p>
<p>記得我童年時候的好勝心要比現在強盛得多，要是偶爾有一次受了”人家的奚落，便會數天不舒服，甚至會悄悄地躱在沒有人的地方去，傷心地痛哭一塲的，所以父親也常常對母親說：</p>
<p>“這孩子太機靈，太好勝，一點委曲也受不下的……”</p>
<p>然而，這一點脾氣我自己也很明白，當人家說到我的當兒，總愛聽幾句誇獎的話，父親不論給我買點什麽，也－定要比給別人的好或多，要是別人的東西比我好或多了，耶就認為是一件奇恥大辱，若不是賭氣索性不要，便悾悶地要好久不說不笑，值到要忘記了這件事，才會恢復原狀。</p>
<p>那也許是我的心地太狹窄：可是我却願意這樣，到如今，我還是有着那樣固執的特有個性呢。</p>
<p>那時候，每年我總要買幾隻風箏來放，父親給我買來的鷹鳶，蝴蝶鳶，都不能夠愜我的意，我總是要求着母親給我買一隻將軍鳶來玩，然而等到在同伴中發現了一隻比我更大的風箏時，我又會覺得自家的趕不上人家，因此再去向父親或母親纒繞，而常常會遭到一塲打罵。但是我並不灰心，因為祖母和我的安姊是我最好的緩頰者。</p>
<p>放風箏的本領要算安姊頂強，她能把一隻不論式樣大小的紙鳶放到天空去，放得很高，很平穩，收回來的時候，又是那麽迅速妥當，斷綫或飛鳶的事情是很少發生的。我自己却並不會放，買來的鳶子也全是由一個堂兄及安姊代放的：不過當看到自己的鳶子飛在天空中戰勝了同伴們的時候，心中就有種說不出的快活。</p>
<p>有一個時候，我和安姊也會想起過自己紮鳶子，於是買紙頭，削篾片，打漿的忙碌了一回，總算四不像地做成了一隻蝴蝶鳶，但是當我們很起勁的跑到風水墩上去放的時候，却老是放不起來，彷彿鳶子上繫着一塊鐵似的，拋了上去，馬上就跌了下來。這才把我們的一團高興，掃蕩得乾乾淨淨。從此，我們也明白了自己的技巧不行。</p>
<p>當我十二歲的那年，我在湖州一個私塾裏念書，有一天我突然聽到天空中出現一種頗熟稔的聲音那聲音，極響亮，有點兒像鴿鈴；我抬頭一望，却正见天空有條巨型的娛蚣在蠕動着，那婉蜓的姿勢，齊整的細足，使我看得十分清晰。那清朗的聲音便是它放出來的。到了晚上：那黑色的影子上亮着一點一點的燈光，隱約地飄在天空中閃爍擺動，像是天上的星星，也像是海面的漁火。</p>
<p>後來，我知道了那就是蜈蚣鳶，響的是鳶鈴，亮的是鳶燈，可是當我向父親要求買一隻同樣的娛蚣鳶時，他說要幾十塊錢，不答應買，去對母親說說，她也說太貴，因此買不起。</p>
<p>現在堂兄和安姊都先後去世了，可是我那蜈蚣鳶還是沒有買過一隻，雖然如今父親已死，母親也不再會來打罵我，然而我自己也覺得它太貴了呵！</p>
<p>數載流浪，幾處飄泊，生活的風霜已消蝕了童年的心情，過去的好勝心，也跟看那可貴的青春一同消失在生活的旅途上了。雖然，每年看到天空中飄着一片一片的風箏時，總會感到一點悵惘，但這終究不過是刹那間的事。</p>
<h3>“特區”寫真</h3>
<p>— 金戈</p>
<p>你們諸位總知道××有個特種營業區吧？告訴你：從××門跨下電車，拐一個灣就得了。第一呌你看見的是“××金號”，你不要傻，這不是銀樓，也不是匯錢票的老式金號，這是特種營業區裏，經售特種東西的特種店。不信？好，你瞧！門口牆上，那張紅紅的，長方形的紙上寫着些什麽？他說：“本店重價收買“×灰”。再不信？你進去試試看說：“我要滙錢到家裏去”，還不是給他們罵出來？但反面，你却可以買到所谓“福寿膏”。像這樣的店真不少，有的是“紗號”，有的是“毛巾號”，總之，呌你千萬別傻，去買他招牌上所標明的東西。</p>
<p>這裏的街道，幾乎每天都是在潮濕中過去的。早上的小菜場的菜販們所遺留下來的垃圾，不知要到下午三時呢或者四時，才見清道夫來打掃。一到雨天，真呌你疑心自己是踏在醬缸裏呢！有一次，我走過那條街，看見有一個死屍倒在路旁。傍晚，我又走過時，那個死屍依舊躺在那裏，祇是身子上多了一條破蓆子。</p>
<p>走過這種病號時，那一陣陣的香味，直透進你的鼻子，你有閒往裹面瞧一瞧，則見有一個人蹲在天井裏，他伺候着那隻爐子。爐子上一隻大鍋子，鍋子裏滿盛着黑越越的，似流非流的膠質。他揑着大蒲扇，拚命的在打扇。紅紅的火光，直把門外的人都灼然了。那香味呢，愈來愈香。</p>
<p>再走進一些是許多手工捲煙廠的廠址，這廠非常之簡單，簡直呌你不敢致信。他們祇有一個方凳那麽大小，那麽高矮的廠址。工塲在此，門市也在此。那位經理兼工友兼老闆更兼門市部職員的人，坐在矮凳上，他一壁在製造，一壁又要兼管門市的買賣，更還要照待顧客。生意非常之好，男女老少，一概無欺。他的主顧大都是車夫或其他的苦力，一個銅元兩枝，從不漲價。至於某一種人，點點頭一枝，眨眨眼一枝，左手一枝，右手一枝……那些經理兼工友兼老闆更兼門市部職員的人，始終沒有發一言半句，他們知道這是“所得稅”。</p>
<p>區內小飯館非常之多，他們是投那些“隱君子”們的機，知道他們在吃黑飯之後，還要來一頓白飯，或半夜點心。生意非常之發達，晚上營業更盛。</p>
<p>區內還有許多的舊貨店，店堂裏預備出賣的舊貨不多，在店鬥口却有許多坡璃面子的盤子，裏面滿盛着烟扦子，烟燈，烟槍，更有那些我不識的東西，反正終逃不出吸烟時所用的東西。有許多人在店堂裏進出，走樓梯的聲音，也不時讓你聽得。店夥子閒坐着在打哈欠，門口有一個大個子，手裏拿着一根竹竿，很閒趣地徘徊在門口。</p>
<p>有一次夜裏，我走過那條街，大約是我瘦了一些，或者是天冷了一些，我把頭縮在大衣的領子裏，左肩下還挾了幾張晚報。在那些招待員看來，我活像是個“老槍”，“老槍”走到“特區”來，當然是想“香兩筒”囉。果然，那個招待員把我的大衣袖一拉，他說：“先生烟吃𠲎？××的烟頂好，路近囉。”</p>
<p>我回過頭去，狠狠地跟他橫了個白眼，用力地在他手裏爭脫了出來，趕忙加緊速度走，他在罵我，我知道，反正總是些“洋盤”，“屈死”之類。</p>
<p>逃出“特區”，我的心不由一定。猛抬頭，却見蟹也似的一串，有老，有小，有男，有女，描寫起來終逃不出“滿面烟容”：“骨瘦如柴”……之類的成語。打頭的那個警察手裏捧着不少的烟盤，烟槍，烟燈之類的烟具。</p>
<p>看看地點，恰巧是在“特區”之外一步的那條××路上。</p>

<h3>汽車平穩制動術</h3>
<p>— 啟績</p>
<p>輕穩的制動術。學起來很容易。只要駕駛者假想他自己是制動器的一部份。制動器的設計無論怎樣高明。其最後的結果。大半還得看駕駛者如何運用制動器踏板而定。運用的程序。是把右腿伸直。把身體支住在座背上。因爲這樣的姿勢。可以得到一種反動力。有些體力尋常的人。一遇緊急的當兒。也能運用高力的踏板。這是因了腿的作用。很像肘節槓杆。我們在腿上用一些尋常的體力。在制動器踏板上就會變成大壓力。如果駕駛者的座位。和制動器的踏板間。配置得適當。任何尋常的人。依上述的方法。都可用出一百五十磅的力來。這種配置的適當與否。在平穩管理制動器上。有着最重大的關係。不然。假使踏板離座位過近或過遠。腿的槓杆作用就難於調和了。最好當踏板完全踏下去的時候。這腿差不多伸直。</p>
<p>這重要的初步事情做好之後。第二步所要討論的。就是運用踏板的方法。有些人遇事突然地把踏板完全踏下。這是個大錯誤。即使在緊急的時候。也不可這樣做。會卒制車。是拖一個車輪鎖住了。並不像逐漸制車那樣地停下。那時車胎滑溜而不轉動。方向的悟性而頓告失去。即使在乾燥的路上。也須使車輸轉動爲上策。如果在滑溜的路上。又把車輪鎖住。其結果總是不堪設想的。在不平的路上更須注意。因爲車輪跳躍而失了附着力。如果制動器裝置適宜的話。那末在踏板上輕輕的一動。就可把制動器蹄推觸到旋轉鼓形輪上去。關於這點。無論何人依上一述方法實試的時候。都會覺得蹄與彭形輪相觸的地位。把腳從加速器上移動至制動器上。再把制動器推進等動作。你只要看當時情勢如何而定。並不煩難。不過駕駛者在制動器踏板上。須逐漸用力。換句話說。把蹄壓到鼓形輪的時候。須逐漸用力。不可立即用足全力。把蹄壓下去。只有把這樣用法成了習慣之後。在緊急的時候。才可避免無謂的壓力。而且在滑的路上。也能平安停車。可避免車輪不旋轉而滑走的危險。</p>
<p>還有一點重要的。就是駕駛者熟悉制動器的感應力。在幾種配置適宜的制動器上。用二倍的壓力能産生二倍的減速度。可是有的制動器配置不合比例。譬如。在踏板上用八十磅的壓力。即可産生尋常的減速力。而用一百磅的力。就能把後輪鎖住了。踏板的壓力。各車不同。所以對於不熟悉的汽車。我們駕駛時。就不可不加以特別的注意。</p>
<p>如果踏板和制動器蹄間的齒輪。有了過份的摩擦。制動器就不易管理。因此。如制動器傅導輪指軸。橫軸支持物等小零件。也都應時常加油潤滑。有的時候。駕駛者雖然很當心地。而又漸漸地使用踏板壓力。而制動器還是突然箝件車輪。這個原因。有的是鼓形輪括傷。有的是面料損壞或者是車軸上螺梢的鬆動。</p>
<p>左圖爲馬迪汽車公司於前星期六第一次展覽一九三七年式派卡汽車後。售與本埠各界之一批派卡新車陣容。按此乃馬迪汽車公司自一九二四年經理派卡汽車以來最大之一批交貨。新車主人翁聞爲招商局金君。怡和洋行潘君。申新紗廠榮君。字林西報馬律斯君。道格拉斯飛機公司巴林君。美安公司斯密得君等云。</p>
<h3>安全駕驶的教学</h3>
<p>— （Y）</p>
<p>汽車的駕術精良與否。對於汽東行駛的安全問題。最有關係。美國支加哥的蘭恩技術專門學校。利用一種廢棄汽車的駕駛用具部份。包括車座。舵輪。制車。克拉子。槓桿等。作為學生所用的課桌。來教學生駕駛汽車。每一個管理桿都有電綫接通到講師所站地方的一個錶版上。當學生們看到幕上所映出交通情狀。而撥動駕駛具時。所有處置情形。都能在燈上顯出。由教師隨時指正。經過這一種的初步教學後。學生們便到一個價值三萬五千金元的駕駛塲中實習。這裏面有各式的跑道。坡度。及灣轉角度等。以便學生們練習。</p>
<h3>福特Ｖ八新車車前端概說</h3>
<p>一九三七年式福特V八汽車之前端之雄姿。可謂在經濟不費之車類中。提供關於流綫型之全新概念。蓋除共前端之新的雄姿外。更有兩種重要機能之改革。使其在切之流綫型上更進一步。原來分離而附靠於車身之頭燈。現則改藏於防泥板中。遂使汽車之前端外觀。獲得極大之改良。現在之發動機罩頂。成一輪廓平滑之頂台。以鉸鍊附着於通風帽。而由前端掀起。發動機罩之兩邊。倘需移動。亦極容易。</p>
<p>福特V八前端之外觀。極顯其雄偉與悅目之曲綫美。前后車檔。俱有實際之保護力。各防泥板之中背。皆隆然突起。而在實際上。充分應用“淚滴”狀。前防泥板要靠發動機罩之旁。高興散熱柵格相齊。更足為汽車前端外雄之雄偉與力量之一助。飾有V八標誌之散熱柵格。由金屬橫條疊成。又有更粗之中央。及兩邊之垂直嵌條。以構成其輪廓。散熱柵格式如“A”字。其末端向後彎曲。深嵌於發動機罩頂台之下。前邊則滑斜而直下。發動機罩之邊窗。作橫行狀。具有克羅米金屬爲之鑲邊。</p>
<p>驕式車身上可開啟之屏風。為尖斜形。而於正中分開作“V”字狀。由是益為流綫型之外觀生色不少。</p>
<h3>一九三七年蘭腦新車暢銷</h3>
<p>一九三七年蘭腦新汽車。自改由霞飛路法大汽車公司經理後。銷路突旺。緣今年該廠出品優良。售價低廉。頗為一般愛好汽車者所歡迎採用。故第一第二兩批新車到滬後。不久即告售聲。致後家往購者均抱向隅。近來預向該公司定購者。日有所聞。據該公司發言人云。第三批新車將於四月初抵滬云。</p>
<h3>一九三六年度美國車廠產銷統計</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>—總共銷售四百六十萬輛—</p>
<p>美國是汽車事業的先進。所以不但國內汽車數量為世界任何邦國所不及。就是在國際市場。美國汽車也唯我獨尊。銷數量大。因此。美國的汽車事業。其盛襄情形如何。另一面也可代表世界汽車業的盛衰情形。那麽在過去一年之中。一九三六年度美國各汽車廠所産的汽車。究竟有多少。這當然也是一個值得提出報告的問題。這裏。且把一年來美國各廠的汽車産銷總數。紀在下面。</p>
<p>據最近美國方面。根據年終股息的分派。花紅的發給。所得到的統計。那麽一九三六年度各汽車廠所製造的。乃至銷去的汽車。總共有四，六○○，○ＯＯ輛。這個數字。當然可代表一九三六年度美國的汽車事業。又有相當的發展這種情形。在汽車廠和車商看來。僅就汽車的産銷回復到常態說來。巳可證明美國復國實業運動的結果。已獲得良好的成績。</p>
<p>我們回想起來。當前年年底。一九三六式新車問世之初。美國的各汽車廠像是受了一種偶然的刺激。産量方面立刻的加多起來。結果在一年之中。使車輛的裝配完成而在市塲出售的。竟有四，六二○，○○○輛。這個數字。自一九二九年黃金時代過去。不景氣開始而後。的確是最高的紀錄。一九二九年的産數。客車和貨車總共五，六○○，○○○輛。使得一九三六年度的美國汽車業。重新進入光明的途逕。除了上面所說的情形而外。還有其他因素。尤其是一九三七式新車問世之後。立刻有驚人銷數。因爲新車在紐約公開展覽而後。使人看出其中有若干優點。為一九三六式新車所缺如。因此。在年底下所有的車商。新車一到。立刻就可銷去。樣子間里時常空着。没有一輛新車的陳列。就是產銷兩方。差數也是很少。非常平均。這種情形。又可使我們想到已回復到－九二九年時的狀態。因為到年底為止。沒有銷去的車輛。所剩的巳是不多了。</p>
<p>除了股息和分紅之外。就一般人的佔計。那么美國各汽車廠在過去一年之中。為了業務的發展。如建築物。機器的添加。和工人或股東的額外支欵。至少常在二○○，○○○，○○○元以上。所有的各汽車廠。一九三六年度所售山的汽車。連同車胎。總值價當有三，○○○，○○○，○○○元。祇是爲了黑潑摩別爾廠事業的停頓。改組尚未就緒。使汽車的産量。略受影響。否則必不止此數呢。總之。無論如何。一九三六年度的美國汽車業。已進入到復與的途逕，那是任何人不會否認的。</p>
<h3>去年福特產額又超過百萬輛</h3>
<p>按照美國密希根州地亞邦市福特汽車公司總公司最近宣稱。一九三六年全年福特汽車公司之總銷數。又超過“百萬汽車”之額。此為過去十七年中之第十一年矣。</p>
<p>據稱按照甫經完畢之統計表。一九三六年之世界售額與世界產量。均大大超過百萬之數。此年份全世界所售福特汽車與貨車。共計一·一“一九·一”六二輛。同期福特世界產量。則為一·一九四·八○○輛。</p>
<p>福特第一次“百萬汽車”年為一九二○年。同年福特世界產量達一·○七四·三三六輛。以後之“百萬汽車”年份則在一九二一·一九二二·一九二三。一九二四。一九二五。一九二六。一九二九。一九三○。以及－九三五年。</p>

<p>[Nanjing] President Chiang of the Executive Yuan hosted a tea party at the Lixingshe at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 16th to welcome the Chinese and Japanese members of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association who came to Nanjing for sightseeing. A total of 24 Japanese members, including Kodama Kenji, and 4 Chinese members, including Zhou Zuomin, Yu Zuoting, Wu Yunzhai, and Zhong Bingfeng, attended. Also invited were Executive Yuan Vice President Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Interior Jiang Zuoobin, Foreign Minister Wang Longhui, Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang, Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council Zhang Qun, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Weng Wenhao, Director of Political Affairs He Lian, Secretary-General of the National Economic Council Qin Fen, and Director of the International Trade Bureau Guo Bingwen. Following this, President Chiang rose to give a speech, after which Chairman Kodama delivered a response on behalf of the group. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] President Chiang gave a speech at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 16th when he hosted Chairman Kodama and others, saying, "Chairman Kodama and distinguished guests, it is truly an honor to have the opportunity to host you today. Since hearing the news of your upcoming visit, our country, both government and public, has been eagerly anticipating the arrival of esteemed guests. We especially welcome you, the experienced, respected, and renowned figures from the Japanese business community. All of you have friendly relations with China in various aspects, whether directly or indirectly. We would rather say that we are welcoming old friends of many years than welcoming an economic inspection group. You are all veteran pioneers who have devoted yourselves to Japan's economic construction since the Meiji Restoration. You have personally experienced the difficulties at the beginning of national construction and deeply understand the joys and hardships of the nation-building process. I believe you have a particularly deep sympathy for our country, which is currently in the construction phase. Our Premier Sun Yat-sen once said that China's National Revolution is like Japan's Meiji Restoration. Perhaps it can be said that what China encountered was even more particularly difficult. The Chinese government, the economic sector, and the business community are striving forward with the same spirit as Japan during the Meiji Restoration era. We have particularly deep expectations for friendly mutual assistance and guidance from our predecessors. We hope that you will use your rich experience to provide as much criticism and guidance as possible on all aspects of China's construction, economic, and industrial matters. Our Chinese business community will surely accept it with enthusiasm and will definitely follow your good example of contributing to the country, so that China and Japan can both advance side by side in culture and economy and serve as a guarantee for peace and welfare in East Asia. We Orientals should respect Oriental culture. I believe you all agree with this point. Orientals can never leave Oriental culture, just as neighboring countries will always be neighbors. Geography and history are immutable. If Eastern nations do not have Eastern culture as their foundation, they will never be able to coexist harmoniously with other nations. The characteristics of Eastern culture lie in benevolence, righteousness, and morality. Eastern countries value propriety and righteousness, so they are called lands of propriety and righteousness. When I was a young student in Japan, I greatly admired the Japanese people's respect for propriety and righteousness and their spirit of amity and humility. I believed that the success of Japan's nation-building lay in this point. Later, I aspired to revolution in order to restore our country's inherent spirit and status and to strive to promote Eastern culture. I also remember that when I resided in Japan in 1928, I met Viscount Shibusawa, a titan of the Japanese business community. Viscount Shibusawa personally gave me a specially proofread copy of the Analects and specially pointed out the two sentences, 'Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire,' saying that he had always adhered to these two maxims throughout his life and often reminded Japanese youth, believing that this was the characteristic of our Eastern spirit. At the same time, he kindly told me that he hoped to work together to promote Eastern culture. Unfortunately, Viscount Shibusawa has now passed away, but his words have left me with deep gratitude and memories that I cannot forget to this day. Today, seeing you veteran pioneers of the business community is like seeing Viscount Shibusawa, so I have brought up the old topic again. Now, please stand up and silently pay tribute to the late Viscount Shibusawa." (The hosts and guests all stood up and observed a moment of silence for one minute.) "Today's reception for you is very simple. In terms of formality, we have not expressed a grand ceremony, and we do not have many ideas to offer you. We are simply acting out of the affectionate feelings of fellow Orientals to present a very simple sentence to you, the highly respected senior members of the business community of our neighboring country, and that sentence is, 'Benevolence and affinity as treasure.' I believe you have long understood its meaning. Only benevolence and affinity can sustain human emotions and drive the progress of civilization. This is especially important for our Eastern nations. I hope that the economic and business communities of China and Japan, as well as the people of both countries, will all work together on the point of being close to the benevolent and friendly to our neighbors. I respectfully wish Chairman Kodama and everyone good health." After President Chiang finished his speech, Chairman Kodama stood up and said, "I deeply agree with the meaning of what President Chiang said. Although we dare not compare ourselves to Mr. Shibusawa, we will continue to uphold Mr. Shibusawa's legacy and continue to strive to clarify the relationship between our two countries. President Chiang has taken the time out of his busy schedule to come and teach us and has bestowed tea and refreshments upon us. I would like to express my gratitude to President Chiang on behalf of my colleagues on this trip," and so on. The hosts and guests parted in joy at 5:00 PM. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Japanese Economic Inspection Group of 25 people visited the capital city's scenery and various scenic spots on the morning of the 16th. At 12:30 PM, all the group members went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to attend a banquet hosted by Foreign Minister Wang. Wang also invited Japanese officials below Ambassador Kawagoe to attend, accompanied by the heads of various ministries and commissions in Nanjing. During the banquet, Foreign Minister Wang rose to give a speech, briefly stating that there was a memorable event in the Sino-Japanese economic circles the year before last, namely that leaders of the Chinese business community, wanting to make Sino-Japanese economic relations more closely intertwined, had organized an inspection group to visit Japan. After the inspection group arrived in Japan, they were fortunate to receive hospitality and various conveniences from all sectors of Japan, and they also frankly exchanged opinions with business tycoons and important government personnel. Although the seeds they sowed have not yet blossomed and borne fruit, the expectations and enthusiasm of sowing those seeds have left a deep impression. This year, the Sino-Japanese Trade Association is holding its first members' conference in China, and leaders of the Japanese business community have come from afar to participate, their purpose also being to discuss how to develop economic relations between China and Japan. This reflects the visit to Japan by the Chinese economic inspection group, and this is of course a commendable and memorable event in the Sino-Japanese economic circles. People from all walks of life in China warmly welcome the gentlemen who have come to China this time, and the Chinese government also feels extremely delighted and expresses the same warm welcome. Since China and Japan are neighboring countries geographically, are of the same race ethnically, and have similar customs and habits culturally, and share the same written language, all relations between the two countries should be especially close and especially sincere. This should be a natural phenomenon. The people of both countries should regard it as a matter of course. In terms of economics, Sino-Japanese commerce should have flourished long ago and made rapid progress. The business communities of both countries should have obtained mutual and equal benefits long ago. The Sino-Japanese Trade Association and the Japan-China Trade Association should have been established firmly long ago and become the general engines for mutual trade. The reason why this kind of good phenomenon has not yet been fully achieved is that there are spiritual obstacles between the people of the two countries. If these obstacles can be removed, then all the natural phenomena that should exist between China and Japan in terms of material things can naturally move forward like a boat sailing with the current and reach the state we hope for. I deeply believe that the gentlemen who have come to China from Japan this time have the greatest enthusiasm to observe everything with a long-term vision and to frankly and sincerely exchange mutually beneficial opinions with all parties related to our country. The success of your efforts will not only be of great benefit to the economic undertakings of the two countries but will also create a new era for the general relations between the two countries. The expectations of you and us are also the expectations of the entire people of China and Japan, and they are also related to the happiness of the future generations of China and Japan. Now, I respectfully raise my glass to wish Ambassador Kawagoe and all the gentlemen good health and to wish Mr. Kodama and other Japanese friends who have come to China together a successful trip. Next, Kawagoe delivered a reply, briefly saying that the Japanese economic community gentlemen's visit to China this time was warmly received by the various institutions and heads of Nanjing, and he was very grateful for Foreign Minister Wang's grand banquet reception. He just continued what Foreign Minister Wang said that China and Japan should have close cooperation and close friendship in various relations, but until now, this goal has not been achieved, which shows that there are still many obstacles and barriers between the two countries, which still need to be removed by the efforts of both governments and the public. When the Chinese economic inspection group went to Japan the year before last, it initiated the Sino-Japanese Trade Association and planted seeds of friendship. According to Minister Wu last night, the climate has become increasingly worse since then, and the seeds have not grown. However, I believe that this seed is still in the ground and has not withered. It is still possible to find ways to make it grow. I believe that if seeds are planted during a good climate, they can be expected to develop quickly, but they are often weak and easily destroyed. If they are planted during a bad climate, although they have to go through various difficulties and obstacles, they will definitely be very strong after they grow up. Therefore, although the Sino-Japanese Trade Association has gone through difficult weather, its future development is infinitely hopeful, and it must achieve good results. Next, Chairman Kodama rose to deliver a reply, briefly stating that although the relationship between China and Japan today does not seem to have reached a good state, we businessmen should not express too much about the general trend of relations between countries. Fortunately, Foreign Minister Wang and Ambassador Kawagoe have given us very clear guidance. We should stand on the position of businessmen and do our best to improve the future Sino-Japanese economy. Although the Sino-Japanese Trade Association seems to have only planted seeds in the past and has not yet developed, it will definitely bloom and bear fruit in the future, without a doubt. We will leave Beijing for Shanghai tomorrow to prepare for the opening of the conference. It is expected that the colleagues from both China and Japan will be able to frankly and directly exchange opinions at this conference and jointly plan for good results. After the speech, the meeting adjourned. At 4:00 PM, they went to the Lixingshe to attend Chairman Chiang's tea party. According to Kodama, he told reporters that the reports in the newspaper a few days ago that the Japanese side had already agreed on ten proposals for the Sino-Japanese Trade Association conference were completely unfounded. As for the report that members of this association had suggested to the Japanese authorities that they hand over 9 million yuan of silver deposited in Japanese banks in Shanghai to China, it depends on how the members proceed. It is not convenient to express an opinion at this time. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Italian Prime Minister's Trip to North Africa and Britain</h3>
<p>— Supplementary</p>
<p>The conflict of interests between Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean and Africa reached its peak during the East African War. However, it gradually eased after the League of Nations lifted sanctions against Italy. After the signing of the Mediterranean Gentlemen's Agreement in January of this year, relations between the two countries began to return to normal. All past disputes and frictions seemed to have completely disappeared. However, it can be seen that this situation can only be maintained for a short period of time, because the conflict of interests between imperialist countries cannot be fundamentally resolved. Therefore, not long after the conclusion of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, Italy transported a large number of troops to Spain to fight, in an attempt to change the status quo in the western Mediterranean. This was naturally a major blow to Britain, which held the opinion of settling matters peacefully. However, the aggressive ambitions of the Fascists did not stop there. Therefore, recently, the Blackshirt Prime Minister made a trip to North Africa, and there he announced the Fascist colonial policy. These are all actions that further challenge Britain and other colonial empires.</p>
<p>The Blackshirt Prime Minister's trip to North Africa was ostensibly to attend the inauguration ceremony of the highway, but in reality it was to inspect Italy's preparations to challenge Britain. The Italian colony of Libya has undergone great development in the past ten years under the rule of Governors De Bono and Balbo. The recently opened 1,900-kilometer-long coastal motor road is of great military significance. The newly built base of Tobruk (Tobrcrcb) on the northeast coast occupies an important position in the Mediterranean strategy. Because from Tobruk to the northeast, it can connect with the island of Rhodes (Rbodas), and to the northwest, it can maintain close relations with the Pantelleria (paotclleria) base. This is truly the most important section of Italy's Mediterranean lifeline. The Blackshirt Prime Minister's trip to North Africa was also to inspect Italy's military preparations in this area, in order to continue to develop the Fascist forces in Africa.</p>
<p>Although Mussolini's trip contained the meaning of demonstrating to Britain, it was not very obvious. However, his recently announced "Italian Policy towards Muslims" is clearly a challenge to Britain and other colonial powers. In the pamphlet he published, Mr. Mussolini called himself "the sole protector of Muslims and Arabs," and said that among the Muslim countries in the Mediterranean, only Libya enjoys peace. Other places such as Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Palestine, which are under the rule of Britain and France, are frequently disturbed. Mussolini's boasting contains important significance. Because he regards himself as "the sole protector of Muslims and Arabs," Italy will annex all lands inhabited by co-religionists and Arabs and turn them into its own colonies. The scale of his ambition is truly astonishing. According to statistics, there are no less than 209 million Muslims in the world, and the land they inhabit is very vast. According to Mr. Mussolini's words, Italy would have to become the world's first major colonial empire. In fact, among the 44 million Muslims in Africa, only 500,000 are under Italian rule and "protection," while 30 million are under British rule and 9 million under French rule. Now Mr. Mussolini claims to be the "protector of Muslims and Arabs." If this is not an expression of Mussolini's megalomania, then it must be that he has harbored the ambition to seize the entire Africa.</p>
<p>Mussolini's actions are on the one hand a manifestation of Fascist Italy's outward expansion policy, and on the other hand an attempt to deliberately demonstrate to Britain and make it show a concessionary attitude in the negotiations on general European issues. Italy's use of this method has been very successful in the past. The outcome of this time depends on whether Britain will continue to adopt a retreating attitude.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Western European Pact Will Proceed Further</h3>
<p>But There Is No Hope of Early Success; Belgium's Status Must Be Resolved First</p>
<p>[Paris] Italian Ambassador to France Cerruti recently visited Foreign Minister Daladier and handed him a copy of the Italian government's reply to the British government regarding the Western European Pact. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Brussels: The German Ambassador to Belgium recently sent a copy of the German government's memorandum to Britain regarding the Western European Pact to the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Official sources do not wish to comment on this memorandum, but general observers believe that this document has not added any new factors to the international situation. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Generally, it is believed that after Germany and Italy have submitted their replies, the French officialdom must believe that the door to further negotiations has been opened, but it is not believed that this new pact has any hope of early success. It is said that Daladier once warned the Russian Ambassador that France must abide by its international obligations, and it is believed that the Belgian Ambassador will make the same statement, and Belgium will continue to faithfully adhere to the League of Nations. (National Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Western European Pact, the Italian government's reply to the two notes from Britain has been delivered here. According to sources from responsible parties, this reply fundamentally expresses disagreement with the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, believing that it conflicts with the 1925 Locarno Pact, and strongly advocates abolishing the mechanical automatic mutual assistance clauses in the pact. If there is any situation where it is necessary to designate an "aggressor," then the two guaranteeing countries, Britain and Italy, should be responsible for the ruling. This is the same as the German attitude. - General observers believe that these demands of Germany and Italy are inevitably excessive, especially Italy. Italy once used force to annex Abyssinia. How can it be allowed to be responsible for determining the aggressor? Observers also believe that Britain has long been determined to base its foreign policy on the principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant, so it cannot consider the methods proposed in the replies from Italy and Germany this time. Moreover, the notes from Italy and Germany clearly advocate restoring the Four-Power Pact of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy in 1933, which runs counter to the current trend of British foreign policy. In addition, responsible parties believe that the current negotiations on the conclusion of the Western European Pact are roughly concentrated on the point of Belgium's neutral status. Judging from the attitudes expressed in the replies from Germany and Italy, only the issue of Belgium's neutral status can be resolved at present. This issue should be quickly compromised by Britain, France, and Germany to jointly guarantee Belgium's security, and Belgium does not need to be a guaranteeing country at the same time. Moreover, this matter should be resolved quickly, otherwise Belgium may try to conclude an agreement with Germany alone to obtain Germany's guarantee. If so, Germany's position will be strengthened, and the position of Britain and France will inevitably be weakened. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Arbitrary Remarks by Japanese Military Personnel Stationed in China Are Useless</h3>
<p>Matsumura of the House of Peers Raises Questions and Secretly Discusses the Suiyuan Issue to Eliminate the Superordinate Status of the Kwantung Army</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Peers held a meeting this morning and had a fierce debate on the arbitrary remarks made by Japanese military personnel stationed in China and the Suiyuan issue. Giichi Matsumura questioned the Minister of the Army, pointing out that Japanese military agencies stationed in China often issued diplomatic statements to China, especially in the past two years. He said that even judging from common sense, such actions are harmful. A few days ago, Army Minister Sugiyama replied to questions from members of the House of Peers, stating that he would again issue a statement regarding the Tanggu Agreement. It is best not to issue this statement. At this point, Matsumura mentioned the declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on November 22nd of last year, stating that Japan had nothing to do with the Suiyuan incident. At the same time, the Kwantung Army stated on December 28th of last year that the Suiyuan incident was an action of the Mongolian army, but if it endangered Manchuria, the Kwantung Army would take resolute action, etc. Matsumura said that the above two statements are extremely contradictory. Will the Minister of the Army warn the Kwantung Army?</p>
<p>Army Minister Sugiyama, in his capacity as President of the Manchurian Affairs Bureau, replied that when events related to the North China Military Agreement occur, it is indeed necessary for the Japanese military stationed in China to issue a statement. However, it is wrong to regard the opinions issued by some officers as the opinions of the Army authorities, especially in the past two years, because violations of the Military Agreement occurred one after another, so the statements also increased accordingly. This kind of behavior is not useless, and this policy will continue to be adopted. The Minister of the Army continued to defend the actions of the Kwantung Army, denied that the statements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Kwantung Army were contradictory, and said that when an incident occurred near its capital, the Kwantung Army could not remain silent. I do not intend to warn them.</p>
<p>Matsumura spoke again, expressing dissatisfaction with the Minister of the Army's reply, and believed that it was completely incorrect, saying that the Military Agreement should be made public as much as possible so that everyone would know. Many newspapers' news about North China was not fabricated by reporters themselves, but was issued by local Japanese officers. Such arbitrary statements are not allowed in diplomacy. Regarding the Suiyuan issue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs listened clearly that it had nothing to do with Japan, while the Kwantung Army said that it did. Isn't this contradictory? What is not contradictory?</p>
<p>At this time, the debate was very intense. Another member, Baron Iwaya, stood up and requested that the debate be changed to a closed meeting so that they could exchange opinions calmly. However, the Minister of the Army did not flinch and replied that if any event is directly related to the commander of the Army, the commander of the Army can issue a statement, but if there is a major event, he must obtain the consent of the diplomatic authorities or the central government. As for the outside world's perception that the Kwantung Army stands in a superordinate position, attention should be paid to eliminating this impression in the future. The Minister of the Army then explained the Suiyuan incident in detail, but did not make it public. Finally, Matsumura warned that when the issue of reducing anti-Japanese sentiment occurs, it must also be handled through diplomatic channels. Regarding the Military Agreement, there must be thorough discussions with the diplomatic authorities. I very much hope that the Minister of the Army will continue to work hard to further tighten military discipline. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Japanese Smuggling and Drug Trafficking</h3>
<p>Smuggling Decreases Slightly, Drug Trafficking Remains: British Government Constantly Informed</p>
<p>[London] Today's House of Commons discussions were almost entirely focused on issues concerning China and Japan. Members of Parliament raised questions regarding smuggling in North China, the Keelung incident in Taiwan, Japanese citizens' involvement in drug trafficking in China, and the issue of Japanese perpetual leaseholds. Initially, Conservative MP Moore requested an overview of the smuggling situation in North China. Under-Secretary Cranborne responded that, according to recent figures, the quantity and value of smuggled goods were gradually decreasing. Moore urged the assembly to note recent reports stating that, in the past three months, Japanese individuals had protected 1,500 loaded vehicles carrying smuggled goods passing through Chinese customs. Cranborne replied that the government was deeply concerned about smuggling, but the quantity and value had decreased. Moore then mentioned China's mortgage debt. Cranborne stated that he was awaiting a report from Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Labour MP Fletcher raised the issue of drug smuggling in China. Under-Secretary Cranborne stated that British consulate staff in China and other officials were regularly providing information about Japanese citizens smuggling drugs into China. This information was immediately sent to the British representative on the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee, who would take effective and necessary measures. Whether or not the information would be made public was a matter for international decision. As far as he knew, the proceedings and reports of the committee's meetings had been published regularly. Fletcher responded that recent reports indicated that Japanese authorities were actively encouraging Japanese citizens to transport and sell drugs. Cranborne replied that the British government was considering the entire issue.</p>
<p>Conservative MP Cayser then asked whether a resolution had been reached regarding the cancellation of perpetual leasehold rights held by British citizens in Japanese treaty ports, following the British Ambassador Clive's presentation of a counter-proposal to the Japanese government, and whether the British leaseholders' committee would consider it a satisfactory solution. Cranborne stated that a solution had been reached in accordance with the counter-proposal presented by the British Ambassador, and that the British Ambassador and the Japanese Foreign Minister would soon exchange documents on the matter.</p>
<p>Regarding the Keelung incident, Under-Secretary Sir Charles stated that the case had not yet been resolved. The Keelung incident occurred on October 7th of last year, and it was said that three British sailors and one British officer had been insulted in Keelung, Taiwan. However, the British Ambassador to Japan and the Japanese Foreign Minister were actively discussing the matter. (Central News Agency, 15th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Russian Peace and Friendship Congress</h3>
<p>Speeches by Many Celebrities</p>
<p>[London] At the Anglo-Russian Peace and Friendship Congress on the 13th, the renowned Soviet writer Alexei Tolstoy attended and delivered a speech, which was very well received. Tolstoy arrived at the venue with Soviet Ambassador Maisky and British writer H.G. Wells. Tolstoy spoke in Russian, which was translated into English, and was frequently interrupted by applause. In particular, when Tolstoy said that there were no books glorifying war in the Soviet Union, the entire audience erupted in thunderous applause. The Archbishop of Canterbury stated in his speech that the greatest revolution in human life had been realized in the Soviet Union, which made him extremely interested in the country. He also said that the Soviet Union's economic freedom and the social control of industry amazed the world. The Soviet Union was the only country where unemployment had been eliminated, the only country that truly protected women, and the only country where children were educated. The Soviet Union was a multi-ethnic country, based on the harmony of the people, which particularly attracted his attention. Subsequently, Griffiths, a theater critic from The Observer, spoke about the situation in the Soviet theater world. Professor Constable discussed Soviet art. Sir Palles spoke about Soviet public education. Cole, a representative from Oxford University and an economist, reported on the Soviet planned economy. Reeves, a representative of the cooperative movement, pointed out the position of Soviet cooperatives in the socialist plan. John Strachey then discussed the case of the Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center in Moscow. Strachey's explanation was endorsed by the entire audience. All representatives expressed their sympathy for the Soviet government's struggle against the Trotskyists. Next, a representative from the Quaker Church stood up and stated that the church had sent him to attend because the Soviet Union did not harbor aggressive intentions towards other countries. Because the Soviet Union had established socialist justice domestically, the Soviet Union had discovered better ways to solve human problems than war. A representative from New Zealand spoke, saying that his country had also heard about the work being carried out in the Soviet Union. New Zealand and Australia feared a major war in the Pacific and knew that the Soviet Union was an important factor for peace. The representative of Indian students who spoke next said that oppressed nations naturally gravitated towards the Soviet Union. According to the report of the Credentials Committee of the Congress, the groups represented at this session had a total membership of 2,834,000, which was double the number of the first Congress last year. The final session of the Congress resolved to establish a permanent Anglo-Soviet Peace and Friendship Committee. The tasks of the committee included organizing similar congresses and committees in various provinces, publishing accurate information about the Soviet Union, and sending representatives to the Soviet Union for investigation. The Congress finally resolved that the next Congress should be held before the end of 1938. (15th TASS)</p>
<h3>Soviet Savings Surge</h3>
<p>[Moscow] In January of this year, the deposits of workers in Soviet savings banks increased by 91,836,000 rubles, reaching a total of 3,626,000,000 rubles. At the beginning of this year, the total savings in each federal republic had doubled compared to the beginning of 1935. They had even increased by two and a half and three times in Armenia and Georgia. In 1936, the average savings per household increased from 173 to 252 rubles, an average increase of 39% in cities and 50% in rural areas. The reasons for the rapid increase in savings were the sharp rise in income of urban and rural people, and the continuous development of the Stakhanovite movement in industry and railways. Another factor was the significant increase in collective agricultural income and labor productivity. At the beginning of 1936, there were 4,200,000 Soviet worker depositors, with total savings of 713,000,000 rubles, of which more than 400,000 households had savings exceeding 500 rubles.

The total flight distance was 63,777,226 miles, and the cargo carried was 6,958,777 pounds, both setting new records. The scale of US aircraft exports was also unprecedented, with the total value of exports of airframes, engines, and other accessories reaching $23,055,761, an increase of 60.9% compared to 1935 and 31.4% compared to the peak year of 1934.

<h3>British Air Force Budget Passed at £88 Million</h3>
<p>More Than £30 Million Increase Over Last Year: Existing Air Force to be Expanded Threefold</p>
<p>[London] British Under-Secretary of State for Air Sir Philip Sassoon presented the Air Force estimates in the House of Commons today, stipulating that the British Air Force be expanded threefold from its current strength and equipped with the latest equipment. The gross expenditure amounts to £88,588,600, and the net expenditure is £56,500,000, an increase of approximately £22,000,000 compared to the total expenditure in 1936. Sir Philip Sassoon explained that we are convinced that a well-equipped and readily available strong British Air Force is one of Britain's best contributions to world peace. Britain's expansion of the Air Force does not mean abandoning the hope of establishing an Air Force Convention and general stability of air armaments. The British government has not only not abandoned this hope, but also believes that the realization of this hope is an extremely important event. If there is an opportunity, it will be used to promote its realization. The current expansion of the Air Force is not only a matter of making up for deficiencies, but also of increasing the Air Force threefold and equipping it with the latest equipment. The manufacturing of aircraft and engines has now gained experience, and new factories have already started construction, so the output of aircraft and engines will definitely be rapid in the future. However, the training of truly skilled drivers and pilots will take time. What can be reported to the House of Commons now is that the supply of talent is very satisfactory. The government plans to train 1,175 pilots this year and is currently engaged in recruitment. The government is now cooperating with the Dominions to train pilots and fill the officer ranks of the Australian Air Force. After the training is completed, they will first serve in the UK for several years before being transferred to the Australian Air Force. New Zealand also has this method and plans to establish a system for examining the physical health of those who apply to the Air Force locally. If Canada also adopts this training, the British government will be very happy to welcome it, because Canada already has hundreds of young people who voluntarily come to the UK for short-term service. Sir Philip Sassoon then spoke of the satisfactory progress of airfield construction and other projects, and then spoke of the issue of producing sufficient grain and supplies. He said that, with the exception of the largest naval aircraft, all biplanes have now been completely replaced by monoplanes, because monoplanes have now reached a perfect form. It used to be quite difficult to obtain sufficiently rigid wings to resist bending, so for many years, it was not possible to quickly switch to monoplanes. Now, this difficulty has been overcome. Continuous attention is paid to all aspects of manufacturing, so the power of new aircraft is very different from that of the same aircraft two years ago. However, the British government is by no means complacent about this and is actively researching every day in order to obtain aircraft with greater speed, longer range, and greater load capacity. Sir Philip Sassoon then described other aspects of progress, saying that two new cannons are now used in aircraft, one is a completely new type of Vickers cannon, and the other is a Browning cannon that is simple to operate and more effective. The government is now trying to manufacture them in the UK. The time required for mass production of new aircraft is less than half of what it used to be. In 1935, the UK built 53 squadrons of domestic aircraft, but now, 124 squadrons can be obtained in a few months. Factories for manufacturing airframes and engines are being established one after another, and progress is good. The government is now giving serious consideration to the need for raw materials to prevent the danger of a shortage of raw materials in wartime, so it has taken measures to hoard several kinds of necessary raw materials in preparation for unforeseen circumstances. Petroleum and other materials have now been procured and stored in places that are not easily attacked by air raids. Sir Philip Sassoon stated the progress of British civil aviation, saying that after the beginning of 1938, the British Imperial Airmail Plan should be fully realized. The total cost for all first-class mail passing through the Imperial air routes from the UK to various parts of the Empire will be one and a half pence per half ounce. He hoped that the South Africa Durban route could be opened in the early summer of this year, and the Singapore route could also be expected to be operational this year. At that time, there will be three weekly mail flights to Kisumu in Africa, two of which will be transferred to Durban, and three weekly flights to Singapore, two of which will be transferred to Sydney. As for flights to Egypt, there will be approximately three weekly flights, two of which will be transferred to India. Therefore, there will be five weekly airmail services from the UK to India in the future. Fuel supply facilities for each route are currently being arranged. As for the North Atlantic aviation business, the government is currently handling matters such as the bases for seaplanes and land planes. There are three main routes across the Atlantic that are currently under consideration. Before the end of the year, or use the four-engine high-speed land plane that is about to be built to make experimental flights. By 1938, the UK should have several specially-built airships. The possibility of long-range airships is currently being studied. As for long-distance training flights, they have already begun. In 1936, the new foreign aviation industries that the UK had already opened included weekly mail flights between Khartoum and Kano, and temporary air services between Penang and Hong Kong.

<p>[London] The House of Commons discussed the Air Force budget yesterday afternoon and held two votes. The first time, the opposition Labour Party's motion was rejected by 175 votes to 119 votes. The second time, the government's proposed budget was passed by 210 votes to 94 votes. During the discussion, opposition Labour Party member Montague fiercely attacked the government's foreign policy, especially its attitude towards Germany's request to restore its former colonies. He said, "Germany is now using a clever strategy, that is, an economic invasion of the old colonies, attempting to recover them and put an accomplished fact before the UK." Liberal Party member Shelley then spoke, expressing his support for the government's policy of expanding armaments, but said that the continued flight power of bombers was limited, and the anti-fog equipment of various aircraft was also insufficient. Later, he mentioned the balloons used by the Air Force, saying that the ascent height of French balloons could reach eight kilometers, while those of the UK only reached three kilometers, which was really inferior. Conservative Party member Wells declared that he hoped that the Imperial Conference in May this year would be able to study an issue, that is, whether the various parts of the British Empire could follow the current practices of Germany and the United States and use Zeppelin-style airships to run scheduled aviation. At this point, opposition Labour Party member Massey proposed a motion, "Future air wars are enough to endanger human culture to a great extent. This House should request the government to use its full strength to promote the abolition of all naval and air force aircraft by various countries and place civil aviation under international management." Under-Secretary of State for Air Sir Philip Sassoon answered in the name of the government, saying that among the countries of the world, the UK was the earliest to promote disarmament conferences. As for the proposal to unify the civil aviation of various countries under international management, there were various difficulties in its implementation. Once this method was implemented, the main air routes between the various parts of the British Empire would not be managed by the UK, and the air routes between France and Italy's headquarters and various colonies would also be transferred to international management, which was not easy. As a result of the discussion, the House of Commons finally rejected the Labour Party's motion and passed the Air Force budget. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas)</p>
<h3>American Jews Hold Anti-German Congress</h3>
<p>Approximately 24,000 Participants: New York Mayor Ridicules Hitler Again</p>
<p>[New York] The American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee held a public rally in Madison Square Park today, attended by approximately 20,000 people. 300 police officers were present to maintain order. The congress passed a resolution advocating spiritual and economic rejection of Germany. Chairman of the American Jewish Congress Wise gave the opening speech, stating that he only opposed Hitler's political philosophy, not the German people. Former Director of the US Reconstruction Administration Johnson delivered a speech, saying that Hitler's mouthpiece newspaper had retorted against the New York Mayor's speech, like a box of poisonous snakes, blindly devouring people. He also said that the National Socialist Party was secretly training stormtroopers in the US, with approximately 10,000 people, and had established youth camps, attempting to politicize American youth and form boy scouts. Johnson pointed out that Hitler was good at lying and was a scourge to world peace, saying that it would be strange not to sign treaties with Communist Russia, Imperialist Japan, Fascist Italy, and National Socialist Germany. Who can trust the peace treaties they sign? Leader of the Committee for Industrial Organization Lewis told the audience that many German trade union leaders had been beaten to death. The masses at the congress finally requested New York Mayor LaGuardia to deliver a speech. The mayor replied, "I don't know what kind of protests today's meeting will cause. I am not worried about what Hitler will say. Hitler is not a good person to deal with in personal diplomacy." (15th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[New York] The American Jewish Congress recently held a grand gathering in Madison Square Park today to express its opposition to German National Socialism. The number of participants totaled 24,000. No fewer than 240,000 people were unable to enter due to the small venue. These people were all listening to speeches in front of wireless radio broadcast machines in nearby thoroughfares. After the meeting began, Director of the Federal Public Works Bureau, that is, former Director of the Reconstruction Bureau, Johnson, first delivered a speech, pointing out that National Socialism was enough to cause various dangers. Chairman of the Industrial Improvement Association Lewis then spoke, criticizing the wage policy implemented in Germany, saying, "German workers earn less than two US dollars per week, accounting for one-third of the total." The congress then immediately passed a resolution, "The American people should refuse to provide financial assistance to Germany in order to prevent its perverse behavior. We should actively boycott its goods and various services in order to peacefully preserve the American democratic system and save the German people from being destroyed by National Socialism." (Central News Agency, 15th, Havas)</p>
<p>[New York] New York City Mayor LaGuardia recently delivered a speech at the American Jewish Congress, saying that German First Leader Hitler should still be considered "the madman in a brown shirt." "You don't have to worry about how Hitler will react. As far as worldwide discussion is concerned, Hitler's personality and his diplomatic actions are both "unacceptable." As for how to explain the word "unacceptable," LaGuardia refused to explain. Many people listening to the side of the podium believed that the deep meaning of this word was "where honor lies, Hitler has no way to intervene." (Central News Agency, 15th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Withdrawal of Volunteer Soldiers Within Spain</h3>
<p>Committee Continues Discussion</p>
<p>[London] The subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee for the Spanish Civil War met this afternoon to discuss the issue of payment of expenses by countries participating in the monitoring plan. The first batch of expenses shared by various countries has been paid, of which only the Polish representative agreed to allocate £1,000. After being urged by the chairman, he requested his government to pay a certain amount in addition. The subcommittee is now scheduled to continue its meeting tomorrow morning to discuss the issue of preventing indirect intervention in the civil war, such as providing financial resources, sending propaganda personnel, and the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers from various countries. The nature of this discussion is quite important. In addition, it is rumored that Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky has sent an official letter to Chairman of the Adjustment Committee Lord Plymouth, stating that the Soviet Union firmly refused to discuss the issue of "neutralizing" the Spanish Republican government's gold deposits abroad. In general, it is feared that the Soviet Union's attitude will cause major difficulties when the subcommittee meets tomorrow, or even affect the monitoring plan that has already been established.

<h3>Spanish Ambassador Appeals to the US</h3>
<p>Pay Attention to Foreign Troops Invading: Endangering World Peace</p>
<p>[Washington] Spanish Ambassador to the US Lorio sent a note to the State Department today, requesting the US government to pay attention to the situation of a large number of foreign troops invading Spain, calling these troops "public enemies of world peace." However, the US does not currently intend to convene a world peace conference or initiate disarmament. It is likely that it will be necessary to see if members of Congress demand that President Roosevelt take action. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] The wording of the memorandum is the same as that submitted by Spanish Foreign Minister Valentín to the League of Nations Secretariat. However, the Spanish Ambassador also stated in the memorandum, "Spain makes a conscience appeal to the world, especially in the United States, because the United States is the site of the Kellogg-Briand Pact."

<p>⊙ Hengtai Today received an unchecked telegram from the Spanish border stating that the commander-in-chief of the government army's Madrid front, Miaja, personally led an international team and cut off the retreat of a large Italian army in a certain place, and seized 500 military vehicles and a train of military supplies. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons met this afternoon. Several members of the opposition Labour Party and Liberal Party questioned Italy's assistance to the Spanish Nationalist Army. Labour Party members Fletcher and Wilkinson said that there were as many as 100,000 Italians helping the Spanish Nationalist Army in combat. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Cranborne answered on behalf of the government that since the implementation of the ban on volunteer soldiers joining Spain, the British government has not known of any foreign volunteer soldiers going there. This point has been explained by Foreign Secretary Eden. The subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee is currently studying the issue of the withdrawal of foreign volunteer soldiers within Spain.

<p>[Paris] After the Spanish government recently revealed to the League of Nations that the Italian regular army was assisting the Nationalist Army, the Socialist Party organ newspaper Le Populaire reported that the French government had alerted the Italian government to the seriousness of this matter.

<h3>German Finance May Be Safe</h3>
<p>Schacht's Speech: Management and Utilization</p>
<p>[Berlin] President of the German National Bank Dr. Schacht delivered a speech at the board meeting of the bank this morning, saying that the secret of the source of funds for Germany's creative work, national defense construction, and other great plans is nothing more than the implementation of strict fiscal discipline. Even if the entire source of funds is unusually difficult, it can be greatly successful if it can be properly managed and utilized. Schacht continued, saying that Germany's current fiscal downturn was really caused by wartime currency inflation, reparations, and the mismanagement of the past, which greatly affected Germany's fiscal foundation and economic system. He assured the audience that Germany was definitely not worried about fiscal dangers today, because the fiscal policy currently being implemented is a strict management method, and German banks have thoroughly studied various situations and are constantly paying attention to the results of their credit policy. If special circumstances are encountered, necessary steps will be taken to deal with them. Schacht solemnly stated that the elasticity of German banks definitely does not conflict with basic fiscal principles. Germany's current fiscal policy is seamlessly connected with credit policy, and its purpose is to establish a healthy relationship between currency and goods. The "mystery" of German fiscal policy is nothing more than ensuring that the national bank pays to general industry, commerce, and the economic system, all of which are returned to the bank as the original amount. This kind of turnover will be difficult to clear in the future due to long-term or short-term loans, but German banks will deal with this problem with the greatest determination and responsibility.

<h3>The Nazi Party's Influence in Danzig is Growing Daily</h3>
<p>Members Increase to Forty-Six</p>
<p>⊙Danzig: Danzig was originally a free city under the protection of the League of Nations according to the Treaty of Versailles. However, the German Nazi Party members in the city, with the aim of completely taking over the administration of the city, have now made considerable progress. Since three opposition members resigned from the Danzig parliament, their successors have now declared their belief in Nazism. Therefore, there are now a total of seventy-two members in the Danzig parliament, and Nazi Party members account for forty-six of them. Furthermore, it is noted that amendments to the Danzig constitution must be passed by a two-thirds majority. The number of seats held by the Nazi Party is only one seat short of this majority.

<h3>Hu Baoshan's Unit of the Pseudo-Mongolian Army in Chahar North Suddenly Mutinies</h3>
<p>Wu Heling has returned to West Banner from Changchun. Li Shouxin's unit will move to West Kaijiabu Temple.</p>
<p>Zhangbei Dispatch: Since the reorganization of the pseudo-army in Chahar North into one army and one division, each has been intensifying training in their respective defense areas. However, judging from the situation of their recent movements and transportation, there seems to be a trend towards more aggressive actions. A certain party has always used deceptive tactics to instigate banditry and treachery. Therefore, the situation is sometimes dull and sometimes tense. However, their ultimate goal remains unclear at this time. According to recent information, De Wang sent his confidant Wu Heling to Changchun earlier this month as a representative to discuss the issue of strengthening the puppet organization with a certain military department. After Wu arrived in Changchun, it happened that the chief of staff of that military department was being newly transferred, so Wu stayed in Changchun. On the twelfth of this month, Wu finally returned to Jiabu Temple from Changchun by plane. At that time, De Wang had already gone to West Suminte Banner for his mother's memorial ceremony. After Wu disembarked, he learned of this news from the greeters and immediately took the original plane to West Banner. Judging from his hurried appearance, there must be a significant meaning to strengthening the puppet organization, so he urgently needed to report to De Wang.</p>
<p>According to Kangbao news, on the night of the twelfth of this month, more than a hundred soldiers from the independent regiment of the pseudo-Mongolian army under Hu Doushan suddenly mutinied, carrying weapons and fleeing eastward. The reason for the mutiny is that a certain party believed that Hu's unit was unstable and feared that it would lead to a major change if it brewed for too long. Therefore, Hu was ordered to implement a downsizing and planned to take the opportunity to disarm and dismiss the unit. Unexpectedly, Hu's subordinates learned of this before it could be implemented, so they mutinied in advance. All the newly issued firearms were taken away. Hu Baoshan also knew that his subordinates were wavering, and because it was at night, he did not give chase, so he allowed them to escape calmly.</p>
<p>The former Li Shouxin's Yin Baoshan Division is mostly stationed in Shangdu, with another three hundred or so soldiers stationed in Baochang. Recently, there has also been news of preparations to move westward to Huade. The pseudo-Fifth Division of Yi Xiaoxian was originally stationed in Baochang and Guyuan and has now concentrated in Dolun, jointly defending with the pseudo-Eighth Division of Bao Yueqing. Currently, Jiabu Temple and Dolun have become the military and political centers of a certain party. (13th)</p>
<h3>Liu Weizhi Discusses Guangdong Province's Economic Construction Plans</h3>
<p>Increasing Production and Creating Factories; Provincial Industries Actively Improving</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Liu Weizhi, the Guangdong Construction Director, went to Beijing some time ago to attend the Third Plenary Session and discuss the progress of various construction plans in Guangdong Province. He has since returned to Guangdong in recent days. From now on, Liu will surely have new plans for construction measures. According to Liu's statement, which is very detailed, a brief record is as follows:</p>
<p>Industrial Construction Plan</p>
<p>Regarding the development of industry in Guangdong Province, efforts should be concentrated on basic industries, and those related to national defense should also be earnestly addressed. Particular attention should be paid to continuing previous factory contracts (such as steel plants, etc.) so that actual work can begin in the short term. Regarding the progress of the steel plant, I have been urging the British Bali Bao Company to submit the final technical report to the government for review and implementation, and at the same time, I am trying to raise funds to fulfill the payment obligations.</p>
<p>Promoting Agricultural Production</p>
<p>A large-scale fertilizer factory is currently being rebuilt. The output of the new factory will be at least 50,000 tons per year, making it comparable to the existing Yonghe Sulfuric Acid Factory in Pukou. Agriculture in the interior of Guangdong mostly needs nitrogen fertilizer. According to previous statistics, the maximum annual sales reached 1.6 million dan. In recent years, agricultural production in Guangdong has not been as good as before, so the demand for fertilizer is less than before. If production is reorganized and promoted, the demand for fertilizer will be greater. Not only can the original state be recovered, but it can also exceed the highest sales volume to date. The existing fertilizer factory has an annual output of only 10,000 tons. The total output of the new factory will be no more than 60,000 tons, which is still not enough to supply the needs of Guangdong Province. The raw materials required by the factory, except for machinery purchased from abroad, will all be sourced from within the province. The construction cost of the factory will require approximately HK$10 million to HK$12 million. Regarding the fundraising method, it is a joint venture with foreign merchants. This method has been finalized and will soon be submitted to the provincial government for discussion and implementation.</p>
<p>Providing Low-Cost Power</p>
<p>Guangdong is known as a good agricultural area and also a good industrial area. Therefore, it is necessary to promote agriculture and industry at the same time, so that economic development can be expected. The most needed thing for industrial development is low-cost "motive power" to reduce costs. To obtain low-cost "motive power," hydropower must be used. The government once proposed the construction of a hydropower plant several years ago. If the former method is followed, the government must raise huge sums of money to start the project. The current financial situation is different from before. If everything must have a huge amount of cash, it is impossible. Therefore, we must use people's capital or foreign capital to set it up. Currently, the fundraising method for the factory is also a joint venture with foreign merchants. As for the first step of the plan, it is to re-measure the original site of the Wengjiang Hydropower Plant, and the rainfall should be investigated clearly. If the local rainfall is sufficient, it can be carried out. The power generation of the plant is set at 50,000 to 75,000 kilowatts per year (kilowatts are also known as "Yan'er" as a unit of electricity). The construction funds will require approximately HK$15 million to HK$20 million. If this plan is realized, the entire project can be completed in about three years.</p>
<p>Planning a Rayon Factory</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned basic industries, it is now planned to set up a rayon factory. Although rayon is a consumer industry, it is also closely related to national defense. It is a shame that such a large country as ours does not have a rayon factory. Currently, negotiations are underway with foreign merchants to jointly operate a medium-sized rayon factory with a daily output of at least three tons. The method will use wood pulp as raw material, requiring approximately $4 million, including working capital. This plan is being actively carried out, and it can be published successively in the near future.</p>
<p>Developing the Qiongya Issue</p>
<p>Regarding the development of Hainan Island, Chairman Song (Ziwen) has drafted a comprehensive plan. In addition, there are other methods. All methods are being discussed. The approximate steps are to promote people's own operations on the one hand and borrow foreign capital on the other hand. The two sides will advance together more easily. Chairman Song and President Sun (Ke), who are most concerned and interested in the development of Qiongya, also plan to go south to inspect in the short term. After efforts are made to promote the development in various aspects, the fundamental plan for the development of Qiongya will surely be resolved to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>Organizing Provincial Industries</p>
<p>Regarding the future methods for organizing provincial industries, plans have been drafted repeatedly. Because provincial industries are entirely business entities, we must first find a way to commercialize them so that they can last. The government has expressed its policy on running industries: all factories that are light industries can be run by the people themselves. Even if the provincial factories that are currently being completed, if the people are willing to undertake them, they can be transferred at any time, so that the people have the opportunity to participate fully in industrial construction, which is also a method of promoting national economic construction. In the future, there are two points that should be paid attention to in improving factory methods: ㊀ Carefully select capable, honest, and clean people to be responsible for handling them so that the public has a full understanding of the actual situation of each factory. ㊁ Make the organization of each factory very strict so that malpractices can be prevented in advance. By doing this, the previous misunderstandings can be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Prison Inmates Gamble and Riot</p>
<p>At about 5:00 pm on the 16th, inmates in the county prison gathered to gamble. When the guards discovered this, they strictly forbade it, but the inmates did not comply. As a result, four ringleaders were interrogated, and all the prisoners in the prison started rioting. Later, prison official Lu ordered all the guards to take strict precautions to prevent incidents. At the same time, the ringleaders were sent to the county prosecutor's office for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Suddenly Becomes Mute After Defecation</p>
<p>Min Xichen's son, Xihua, a resident of Yiqiao Township in the county's Third District, had an opium addiction. After being ordered to quit by the county government, he continued to smoke after being discharged from the hospital. He was caught by the Fu Bureau and sent to the county hospital for investigation. He was found to be addicted to opium and sentenced to three years in a smoke offender's detention center. At about 9:00 am on the 14th, Min had an urgent need to urinate, coughed and salivated, and at the same time, his lips and tongue were crooked, and he could not speak, suddenly becoming mute. The symptoms are very bizarre.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Baizhang Gathered for Training in Su</p>
<p>The township Baizhang of the whole county are ordered to be re-elected. The county government ordered all districts to actively handle this matter. The various bureaus have submitted reports to the county government. They are now being reviewed in batches and will be completed this month. The training of the Baizhang of the eight counties in the second district of Jiangsu, Wu County, Changshu, Wuxi, Changzhou, Wujiang, Kunshan, etc., was originally scheduled to begin in Wuxi in April for centralized training. Because Wuxi does not have a suitable location, the commissioner's office specially instructed Wu County Magistrate Deng on the 16th to change the training of the Baizhang of the eight counties to be held in Wu County. Deng County Magistrate, upon receiving the order, believes that the county middle school and the junior high school department of the provincial Suzhou middle school can accommodate more than 2,000 people, which is more suitable. He immediately reported it to the commissioner's office for approval.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Representatives of the Whole Jiangsu Silk to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Silk Industry Association of Trade Unions held a meeting in Wuxi some time ago because the Zhejiang silk industry will hold a meeting in Shanghai within days to discuss the improvement of the silk industry in the two provinces. More than 20 representatives from Wuxi, Liyang, Danyang, Yixing, Wujin, Jintan, etc. attended the meeting, chaired by Chen Xiekun. First, he reported on the last time he went to the province to request the construction department to maintain the original silk business, continue to issue posts, and urge each silk business to change to the new-style silkworm drying machine, and request the construction department to designate special funds to promote the common breeding of silkworms, etc. After that, the discussion began. ㊀ Proposals for the joint meeting of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang silk industries: (A) Reorganize the former Shanghai Silk Industry Association; (B) Establish a joint office in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces; (C) Inquire about the cooperation methods in Zhejiang Province. ㊁ Determine that Chen Xiekun, Jiang Daoshan, Ma Yintang, Wei Shixin, Hu Yinjie, Jing Shaopan, Xu Haoran, Cao Shaochen, and Chen Xiaoqing will be the representatives to attend the meeting in Shanghai. ㊂ Determine to convene a general assembly of representatives from all counties on April 20. ㊃ Counties that owe membership fees should quickly pay them off in order to conclude the meeting. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. The representatives had already gone to Shanghai at the appointed time yesterday.</p>
<p>Detaining and Pursuing Grain Households in Arrears</p>
<p>The county's old arrears of land tax over the years have reached millions. The province ordered that it be paid in full in three installments within five months. It also dispatched a commissioner to sit in the county to expedite the collection. The amount collected in the first two installments was very small. The grain households assigned by each Tuzheng were also scattered small households. At that time, the land tax office transferred all the Tuzheng and grain households with the most arrears to the county for detention and pursuit, about more than 100 people. At 11:00 am on the 16th, Li Pingzhen, a grain household in Yanqiaotou, the seventh district, was also detained in the county for arrears of several hundred yuan and repeated urging. At the same time, all the expediting camps were ordered to collect 50% of the amount before the end of April and should not be short of a single point.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Mediating the Dispute at the Minfeng Factory</p>
<p>The Wuyi County Government convened a conciliation committee on the afternoon of the 15th to mediate the labor dispute at the Minfeng Yarn Factory. The chairman, County Magistrate Hou Houzong, discussed the following items based on the seven conditions proposed by the labor side: ㊀ Request to restore the previously reduced wages and decide that the wage standard should be handled in accordance with the Dacheng Yarn Factory; ㊁ Request to cancel the decision of the training class students to work as temporary supervisors and let the technical managers clarify their responsibilities, carefully adjust, and improve work efficiency. In the future, the factory will select outstanding workers from the existing workers to train the student workers first. The principle of clarifying the responsibilities of the student workers and temporary supervisors will be formulated by the factory in consultation with the Trade Union Federation; ㊂ Decide that workers should not be dismissed without reason; ㊃ Request to reinstate the dismissed temporary supervisors and workers without fault. It was decided that there were no facts and it was not necessary to discuss; ㊄ Request that the workers' wage booklets should indicate the daily wages earned and should be paid daily. It was decided that the factory had already done so and there was no need to discuss; ㊅ Request that the factory should not force workers to teach the student workers. It was decided to do so; ㊆ Request that the training director Chen Yuquan and the old worker of the weaving department Shen Jinsheng be dismissed. It was decided that this was the factory's administration and should be handled by the factory itself.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Promoting Improved Cotton Seeds</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Production Improvement Office is currently setting up three cotton cultivation center promotion areas in northern Jiangsu to select and cultivate improved cotton seeds and lend them to cotton farmers, starting from the coastal reclamation area. Nantong Sanyu is allocated 5,000 dan of Deozi cotton seeds, Dongtai Dafeng is allocated 7,200 dan of Jinzi cotton seeds, and Funing Tongda Jichan Office is allocated 3,240 dan of Jinzi cotton seeds.</p>
<p>Continuing to Search and Arrest Opium and Drug Offenders</p>
<p>During the general re-examination of opium and drug offenders in Tongyi, the number of those reported but not yet arrested was very large. The county government ordered all districts to continue searching and arresting them and set a deadline of one month for suspected opium and drug offenders to surrender and be investigated. The District Security Command also burned the seized opium and drug paraphernalia on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Yangzhou Flour Mill Decides to Stop Production</p>
<p>The Yangzhou Flour Mill outside the Bianyi Gate in Yangzhou, which has its headquarters in Shanghai, has been suspended this year, waiting for the shareholders to meet and decide on a solution. It is now learned that more than 40 shareholder representatives from Zhenjiang, Shanghai, Wang Jingzhi, Huang Shaoliang, Zhu Hegao, etc. have held a temporary meeting on the 7th and decided: ㊀ Attract capitalists for economic cooperation; ㊁ Rent out the factory; ㊂ Sell the factory. There are three methods, and the board of directors is responsible for selecting one for implementation. It is heard that the reason for the suspension is that the company's output, 900,000 bags per year, is sold in Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Huaiyin, Yancheng, and other ports. Last year, the company that sold in Yangzhou hoarded powder and waited for the price to rise, resulting in a shortage of turnover. It is also heard that the board of directors finds it difficult to implement the second method decided in a short time. Yangzhou's industry and commerce will also wither, and the number of unemployed will increase again.</p>
<p>The Tourism Industry Accuses the Shipping Bureau of Changing Shifts</p>
<p>The Xinyonglong Shipping Bureau in Shaobo Town, the seventh district of Jiangdu, has changed the sailing time of the Yan-Shao shift, causing the tourism industry in Yan and Shao to feel that there are no passengers staying, which hinders their business. They have jointly filed a complaint with the competent authority. It is now heard that the county government has received instructions from the commissioner's office of the seventh district, roughly stating that the company should still follow the prescribed time for sailing before it has been approved and is not allowed to change it without authorization. Violators will be punished.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Discovery of Abuse of a Maid Resulting in Death</p>
<p>Shen Quanfu's family, the owner of Shen Hengmao Crockery in Xin Sheng Town, had a maid named Shun Jin, who was only 11 years old. She was often abused. On the first of this month, the maid suddenly died. The owner's family put the body in a crock and buried it somewhere. Later, the Public Security Bureau of Xin Sheng District learned that the maid had died from abuse and arrested Shen Quanfu. They reported to the local court to send someone to the town to open the crock for inspection on the 15th. It was found that there were many injuries on the right temple and lower part of the body. Shen Quanfu was escorted by the court on the 16th for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Sentenced to Imprisonment for Losing the City</p>
<p>The county seat of Changhua County was captured by bandits on December 21 of last year. The provincial government believed that the county magistrate Jin Mingchang had abandoned his post and stayed in the provincial capital. He was arrested by the police and transferred to the court for trial. Later, the section chief and secretary of the county government were also escorted to Hangzhou for trial. After the investigation was concluded, the judge of the criminal court, Chen Luzhi, brought the prisoners from the detention center at 3:00 pm on the 16th and announced the judgment in court. Yu Mingchang was sentenced to four years of imprisonment for abandoning his duties and causing the loss of the county seat. Li An, the chief of the public security section, was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment. Wei Yinghuang, the secretary, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>The Military and Police Inspection Office Ends</p>
<p>The joint military and police inspection office in this port was established in November of last year. Now that the winter defense has expired, the office was ordered to be abolished on the 15th. The office personnel and team leaders of each inspection team transferred from various agencies have been sent back to their original agencies.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan</h3>
<p>Snow Falls in Spring Due to Cold Weather</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, the county has experienced continuous spring rains and abnormal weather. Occasionally, it clears up, the scorching sun is like fire, the cuckoo begins to cry, and the azaleas bloom, as if it were the third month of spring. Last night, the weather turned cold again, with howling winds. In the middle of the night, snowflakes danced in the air. The high mountains and peaks were covered with three or four inches of snow, the first heavy snow of the past winter and this spring.</p>
<p>Tea Tax Collection Office Set Up</p>
<p>The county's tea tax was collected by the business tax bureau last year, and no separate bureau was set up. This year, the Gan Tax Bureau believes that Wuyuan and Xiushui counties produce a large amount of tea and that an office should be set up in each county this year as a special collection agency. It has been submitted to the financial hall for submission to the provincial affairs meeting for approval. The tax bureau has commissioned Cheng Yinguo as the director of the tea tax office in the county and ordered him to establish and report immediately. After receiving the commission, Cheng established the office on the 11th.</p>

<p>National Goods Special Issue</p>
<h3>An Address to the Members of the Japanese Economic Survey Mission</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The Japanese Economic Survey Mission has come to China to investigate the economy. From the perspective of the national goods industry, I would like to offer a few words to the gentlemen of the mission:</p>
<p>First, the mission should know that the national goods industry in China has been operating arduously in recent years. Fortunately, it has not been wiped out, thanks to the patriotic enthusiasm of the people and the efforts of our industrial sector. Our industrial and commercial sectors have no conflict with the Japanese industrial and commercial sectors and do not hinder them. I hope the Japanese industrial and commercial sectors will not be jealous or afraid. It must be known that our country's industry and commerce are seeking a way out, which is to seek survival. The desire to survive is inherent in human beings. A country's attention to its national industry is the basis for a country's nation to survive. Japan is like this, and so is China. If we treat each other with compassion and think about the other party in everything, there will be no problems.</p>
<p>Second, to make products welcome and popular, the first thing is to make the other party feel good and have faith. If you give people unpleasant things and bad impressions every day, and want the other party to be willing to use my products, there is no such thing in the world. Therefore, I think that the mission should start by correcting the political aspects. Before the political issues are properly resolved, no matter how you talk about Sino-Japanese trade, there will never be satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Third, what the Chinese industrial and commercial sector is most pained by is smuggling. At present, smuggling is still rampant in North China, and the Japanese government has not taken any action to stop it. This kind of method is no different from destroying the lifeblood of Chinese industry and commerce, and putting the industrial and commercial sector to death. If this is not changed, any economic cooperation is out of the question. Moreover, if this continues, enduring and enduring, there will be a day when we can no longer endure it. I am very worried about the future of Chinese trade. I hope that after the members of the mission return to their country, they will quickly report to the government and quickly correct this improper and unreasonable behavior.</p>
<p>I dare to speak frankly because the members of the mission are all leaders in the Japanese economic sector and are very clear about the situation in China, and they are also the hope of both Chinese and Japanese people. I hope you will appreciate my foolish sincerity and adopt it.</p>
<h3>National Doctor's Day and the Promotion of the National Medicine Movement</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Today, March 17th, is Chinese National Doctor's Day. National associations of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and TCM associations in various places are convening commemorative assemblies to celebrate. In the history of Chinese medicine, this is truly a page worth recording, and one we must not ignore.</p>
<p>However, as members of the national medical community commemorate National Doctor's Day today, the author has some thoughts. Besides making it our goal to purchase domestic goods for our clothing, food, daily necessities, and all other necessities of life, we should also earnestly promote and use Chinese medicine. On the one hand, we will preserve our national essence. At the same time, we can reduce the amount of imported foreign medicines and increase the strength and vitality of the national economy. This is the broad sense of the national goods movement.</p>
<p>At present, our country's Chinese medicine industry has made rapid progress through the efforts of the medical community, which we cannot deny. Now, we need to go further, besides preserving the essence of Chinese medicine (i.e., decocted Chinese medicine), we should also promote and use the famous domestic factories, such as the artificial blood invented by the Wuzhou Pharmacy, the Bushiming recently created by the Xin Ya Pharmaceutical Factory, various cod liver oils from the Zhongxi Pharmacy, Aloe Brain Tonic from the Zhongfa Pharmacy, and the Shiyan Baoxian Gujing Pills from the Aihua Pharmaceutical Society, etc. You should know that I am not here to do free publicity for these domestic factories. In fact, their products have long left a deep, positive, and never-fading impression on the people of society.</p>
<p>In short, as we commemorate National Doctor's Day today, I hope that the medical community will conduct further research on the substance of their profession and, to the extent possible, show more compassion for the poor and helpless patients. At the same time, I also hope that compatriots across the country will purchase and promote the above-mentioned first-class domestic drugs as much as possible. Don't waste good money to buy imported medicines, disregard the national economy, and willingly act as a salesperson for foreign goods. These are the thoughts that the author has on today's National Doctor's Day. What do you think?</p>
<h3>Genuineness and Fair Price</h3>
<p>— Master of Yiyi Hall</p>
<p>"Genuineness and fair price" is a common saying in our country's commercial circles. It can also be said to be a "golden rule" for business management. Because, for any store, if it can adhere to "genuineness and fair price," then its business must be prosperous. Otherwise, it will inevitably suffer from sluggish business and even "bankruptcy!" From this perspective, who can deny that the saying "genuineness and fair price" is a "golden rule" for business management?</p>
<p>Now, I feel that at a time when everyone is enthusiastically promoting "national products," while being eager to buy "national products," some people are also being "blinded by greed" and disguising "imported goods" to pass them off as "national products!" We often hear about such things; it cannot be said to be "completely unique."</p>
<p>We must understand that using "foreign goods" to impersonate "national products" cannot be considered "genuine." As for the price, since it is impersonating "foreign goods," it will inevitably be sold at the original price of "foreign goods." In other words, "foreign goods" are ultimately more expensive than "national products," and their original price will not be lowered simply because they are impersonating "national products." Therefore, if one impersonates "national products" but does not sell them at the corresponding price of "national products," this cannot be considered a "fair price!" Because of this, with the "goods" being not "genuine" and the "price" being not "fair," the result will not only lead to the ultimate failure of one's own business but will also undermine the reputation of "national products!" I think: The slow development of the "national products" industry may well be due to this major reason!</p>
<p>Therefore, the reason I am writing this article on "Genuineness and Fair Price" is simply to hope that the general national products manufacturers will know how to encourage themselves. They should not use non-"national products" to deceive customers, which would make the prices of genuine "national products" also suspected of being unfair. In short, in business management, "genuineness and fair price" are essential, and especially in the business of "national products," "genuineness and fair price" are even more crucial!</p>
<h3>National Products for Civil Servants Year: National Products Pens, Inks, and Paper (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>This year has been designated as the National Products Year for Civil Servants. I hope that civil servants across the country will understand their duties and responsibilities and strive to promote and use national products. I believe that civil servants are all intellectuals and will not forget their duties. Therefore, the National Products Year for Civil Servants will surely bring relatively fruitful results. As a member of the civil service, I offer this as self-encouragement and encouragement to civil servants across the country.</p>
<p>When writing Chinese characters, one should naturally use Chinese pens, Chinese ink, and Chinese paper. However, some civil servants prefer to use imported goods. But there are some distinctions here. Some knowingly use them, while others unknowingly misuse them. The former is more culpable, while the latter can be forgiven. In reality, the latter is more common. Therefore, the Executive Yuan has specially compiled a list of national products for common use by various agencies so that the agencies know what to purchase. I am now forwarding this introduction, hoping that civil servants, students, and people from all sectors of industry and commerce will pay attention and jointly promote the use of national products to recover lost revenue and invigorate national products.</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion on Sales Promotion (4)</h3>
<p>— Ding Kai</p>
<p>㊁ Sales Promotion Also Requires Necessary Investigation and Statistical Work</p>
<p>Since the victory of sales promotion belongs to psychological analysis, the investigation and analysis of the market should also be carried out in parallel. This issue is very obvious. Because the former belongs to speculation and prediction, while the latter belongs to facts and evidence. In the author's opinion, a slightly scaled company or factory must at least collect the following types of materials.</p>
<p>(A) The status of transportation in various places (domestic and foreign Nanyang Islands should be distinguished).</p>
<p>(B) Investigation of the sales status of targeted goods (equal emphasis on imported goods and similar products).</p>
<p>(C) Investigation of the economic status and consumption status of sales, as well as the dynamics of life.</p>
<p>(D) Investigation of the status of foreign merchants handling goods.</p>
<p>(E) Statistical charts of annual business aspects.</p>
<p>In order to study sales promotion, the author often visits the authorities of national product factories or receives consultations from national product manufacturers. I always ask, "Have you seen any materials for business reference?" However, many factories that I have contacted have almost none, and even consider investigation and statistics to be unnecessary waste. On the other hand, foreign merchants pay attention to the dynamics of our business situation. They treat a piece of information like a rare feather. Not only do commercial officials stationed in China use the government's position to help their national factories with information work, but there are even factory representatives stationed in China who come from thousands of miles away. They are both promoting goods and collecting information. It can be seen that only by knowing yourself and your enemy can you be victorious in every battle.</p>
<h3>Deliberations on Changing the Route of National Product Visits</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>A contribution to the National Products Movement Association and the Visiting Ladies</p>
<p>The ancient saying, "Just ask about cultivation, don't ask about harvest," contains the meaning of using one's spirit to gain one's career. The history of the national products movement is also more than twenty years old. It is only now that it is splendid and flourishing, showing that things are done by people. Just ask about cultivation, don't ask about the harvest, indeed has a profound meaning. The efforts of the female national product visitors are deeply imprinted in our minds. Therefore, Mr. Yang Yao, in his "Contribution Words" article, proved that "national product visits have indeed made great contributions to the development of the national product industry!</p>
<p>However, I still have some personal opinions to contribute to the gentlemen of the National Products Movement Committee and the ladies of the National Product Visitors. That is, the route of the visits should be changed as soon as possible. As everyone knows, the western district of Shanghai is a concentrated area of so-called higher-class Chinese families who are aristocratic or Westernized, with the greatest purchasing power and the greatest consumption of foreign goods. Visits and persuasion to switch to national products are imperative. However, although the eastern district of Shanghai is said to be an industrial area, there are also many family residences in the Pingliang Road, Yulin Road, Chuanpeng Road, Yangshupu Road area. It is also a densely populated area of men, women, and workers. Their impression of national products is even weaker. Because of the large population, the consumption power is also very surprising. Our comrades who love national products really do not want them to use the money earned from their sweat and blood to promote foreign goods and send money to foreigners. I think that the visiting ladies should quickly plan to change the route and visit the eastern district of Shanghai to work hard to guide the national products of the lower classes. Do not overemphasize neglecting the families of so many toiling masses, which is also very sufficient to affect the future of national products. This is the motivation for me to write this article, hoping to achieve it after commercial rights!</p>
<h3>Production and Consumers of First-Class National Products</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>This year is known as the National Products Year for Civil Servants. All civil servants should make special efforts for national products. Therefore, Mayor Wu and Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau of this city, standing in the position of leaders, in order to enable the general civil servants and the public to have a deeper understanding of national products, Mayor Wu personally inscribed the words "Promote Recognition of First-Class National Products" to promote and introduce them. This is very admirable to us. However, the author has two thorough ideas about this and dares to excerpt them below. ㊀ All major national trade factories in the country should strive for beauty and durability in terms of crack goods, deliver goods quickly, and strive for low waste in terms of pricing. If so, both increase the faith of buyers, the business will naturally develop, and meet the first-class national products of the good name. ㊁ Consumers, in view of the fact that our country already has fine and inexpensive first-class national trade, should naturally do their best to promote medicinal use, and should never buy external loans again, and there is no need to buy foreign goods, so that the two parties of production and consumption can sincerely cooperate, I can determine that the number of excess imports can be gradually reduced, and to reduce, the national economy and people's livelihood, can naturally become increasingly prosperous.</p>

<h3>West Qing Volleyball Team Wins Championship</h3>
<p>▲ Hai Qing Suffers Another Defeat</p>
<p>Since Hai Qing Jia lost to the Russian Army, it was known that its bid for the championship was in jeopardy. However, there was a glimmer of hope: if Hai Qing could lose to West Qing again in the first round, there could still be a triangular contest for a last chance. Unfortunately, the god of volleyball was not with them. In last night's first game, it became a one-sided situation. West Qing won with 15-6 very easily. In the second game, although Hai Qing actively fought back, they were unable to reverse the situation with 13-15. In another match, the Russian Army beat Su Ke Er in two games. Su Ke Er only scored four points, and the difference in strength was like heaven and earth. Thus, West Qing won the championship with five wins and one loss. The Russian Army took second place with four wins and two losses. Hai Qing, the champion of last year, fell to third place with one win and three losses. Su Ke Er did not win a single match and only managed to win one game against Hai Qing in the first match, thus finishing last. In yesterday's match, Hai Qing's Weinoda Gai and Zhang Renming did not play and were replaced by Chen Zhiguang and Liu Zichang from Group B, which also had some impact, it is said. Today, there are two matches in the women's group, with the following schedule:</p>

<h3>Yugu Village Case</h3>
<p>Secretary-General Yu Visited Feixin Dun Yesterday, the First Special District Federation Sent a Letter Requesting Restoration</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that since Yugu Village, a key thoroughfare in the road-crossing section, was blocked by the Public Concession's Public Works Department due to tenants' refusal to pay housing taxes, the two sides have been at a stalemate and have not yet resolved the issue. The Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, in order to break the deadlock, specially consulted with Feixin Dun, Director-General of the Public Works Department, yesterday to discuss a solution. The main points are as follows: ⑴ The Public Works Department of the Public Concession will immediately remove the obstacles blocking Yugu Village and restore the sewers and drains to their original state. ⑵ The owners will temporarily find a way to collect all the owed housing taxes in the neighborhood and pay them to the Municipal Government. After receiving these housing taxes, the Municipal Government will negotiate with the Public Works Department to partially resolve the housing tax issue in the road-crossing area. If a solution is reached, the funds will be allocated according to the new solution; otherwise, the funds will be paid to the Public Works Department as compensation for the residents' use of the sewers and drains in the area.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng Daily reports that the First Special District Citizens' Federation, after receiving a report from the citizens' branch in the district requesting assistance, sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday morning stating that the Yugu Village area in the jurisdiction of the Municipal Police Department had been forced to pay housing taxes by Police Chief Huang using means such as blocking traffic, causing all residents to lose their freedom of movement innocently and causing significant unrest. The responsibility of the municipal government is to ensure the safety of public order, and the fact that your bureau is using any means necessary is deeply regrettable. Therefore, we specially request that your bureau call a halt, voluntarily remove all obstacles in Yugu Village, and avoid causing unfortunate and serious consequences. This is what we are happy to see.</p>
<h3>Liu Jingshan Flew Back to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

<p>Xin Xin Daily reports that the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, invested in by the China Construction Bank and domestic financial circles, along the main line from Chengdu to Chongqing (referred to as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway), the officially determined land price along the line was originally intended to be purchased at 25 yuan per mu. However, the landowners requested an increase in the land price, so the company sent Liu Jingshan, assistant manager of the China Construction Bank and director of the company, to Sichuan. After long-term negotiations with Liu Xiang, chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, and the landowners, it was agreed to purchase the land at an average price of 45 yuan per mu. However, the provincial government still requested a limit of 50 yuan, a very small difference that is not difficult to resolve. Mr. Liu Jingshan, having completed his work in Sichuan, arrived in Shanghai by plane yesterday to report to the company on the negotiation process for land prices and other issues.</p>

<h3>British Community Nominates New Members for the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Japanese Candidates Must Be Elected Separately</p>
<p>The British Residents' Association of Shanghai held a meeting last week to elect five British candidates for the new 1937 Shanghai Municipal Council. The election results were announced on Monday: Messrs. Keeler (Brunner, Mond &amp; Co.), King (Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.), MacDonald (Mackenzie &amp; Co.), McIntosh (Krouse &amp; Co.), and Pott (formerly of the British Consular Service in China) were elected. Five other candidates, including Mr. Hailes, were not elected. Of the five elected members, only Mr. Pott is an incumbent councilor. Mr. Keeler was a councilor previously. The remaining three, although well-respected in the business community, are newcomers to municipal affairs. The current British councilors who did not seek re-election are Messrs. Snowden, Keswick, Mitcham, and Major General MacNaghten. The number of American, British, and Japanese candidates nominated this year is in accordance with the regulations, so there may not be an election to avoid unnecessary trouble. The Japanese candidates previously nominated were Messrs. Yamamoto and Urape, but since both have declined to run, other candidates must be nominated to replace them. However, the number will still be two. The date for the election of Chinese councilors has been set for April 5th and 6th. The deadline for submitting candidate applications is February 27th, at which time the final list should be announced. Mr. Summerson of the Hope Guiding Fire Insurance Company and Mr. Paulsen, General Manager of the Great Ale Ray Report Company, have been invited to serve as ballot counters and have accepted.</p>
<h3>City Federation Opposes Municipal Council's Tax Increase</h3>
<p>Declaration Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city has issued a declaration regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposed increase in the general municipal tax. The declaration states: "We recently read in the newspapers that the Public Concession's Municipal Council intends to increase the general municipal tax to 16% (an increase of 2%), which seems likely to be implemented. We are deeply shocked by this. The Municipal Council's excuse of balancing its revenue and expenditure to implement the tax increase is simply untenable. Although the Municipal Council's revenue was reduced by a significant 1,250,000 yuan last year due to the economic downturn, the council's austerity policies have not considered the bigger picture. For example, the exchange allowances for foreign staff and the exorbitant costs of the band have not been eliminated. If these two items could be saved and used to offset the shortfall, it would be more than sufficient. This shows that there is still much waste in expenditure. As for the claim that the tax rate in the Public Concession is lower than in any other city in the world, regardless of whether this statement is true, circumstances vary and the ability of taxpayers to pay also differs. This cannot be used as a reason for increasing taxes. Moreover, in any city in the world, the largest proportion of taxes is used to improve the welfare of taxpayers. The Public Concession's Municipal Council has failed to fully achieve this. Furthermore, the Municipal Council believes that the economy has improved and that an increase may be possible. This is a superficial view. It is well known that the decline in the Municipal Council's revenue in recent years is solely due to the economic downturn. The economic recovery is a good opportunity for the municipal authorities to support industry and commerce and cultivate tax revenues. If given a little time, tax revenues will surely return to their former levels. Now, the Municipal Council wants to compensate for the decline in tax revenue by taking it from the taxpayers. From whom will the taxpayers, whose incomes have also declined, take it? This is only to obstruct the recovery of industry and commerce. In short, the Municipal Council should understand that under the current circumstances, there is no valid reason to increase taxes. The Federation hereby solemnly declares that if the Public Concession's Municipal Council disregards the opinions of its constituents and insists on increasing taxes, then those who agree to the increase should bear all the expenses of the Municipal Council. This declaration is made."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Increases Anti-Smuggling Team to Prevent Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Evasion</h3>

<h3>Shanghai County Government Organizes Grain Storage Measures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received an order from the Provincial Government to issue a plan for the implementation of grain storage. County Magistrate Li Zhifu, after receiving the order, believed that grain storage for famine relief is an important local policy and should be strictly followed. Therefore, he ordered Qi Kezhong, the Director of Construction, to work with Wang Chengyao, the Director of the County Treasury, to formulate eight revised measures based on local needs: ① Expand the county granary and request the allocation of 5,000 yuan from the grain storage funds to build ten additional granary rooms on the existing county granary land. The county will prepare a budget and drawings and submit them to the province for approval.

<h3>Chinese Laborers Who Served in France During WWI Are Scheduled to Return to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>Before Departing, They Request the Authorities to Return Their Money Deposited in France</p>
<p>The thirty-three Chinese laborers, including Ding Huanzhang, who served in France during World War I, have returned to China and arrived in Shanghai. However, they have not been able to leave Shanghai because they lack funds for transportation. Yesterday, they sent representatives to the police station to request that ship tickets be distributed. The Second Section Chief, Hong Qi, received them and promised to issue the tickets within one or two days. With the ship tickets secured, the laborers plan to return to their hometowns on the afternoon of the 18th. Eighteen of them are going to Tianjin, six to Qingdao, two to Nanjing, two to Wuxi, two to Xuzhou, and three to Changsha. At the same time, the Chinese laborers, with the assistance of Mr. Yang Gengtao, have decided to hold a tea party at 4 p.m. today to thank Mr. Yang. Furthermore, Ding and others jointly submitted a petition to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, requesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs order the consulate in Paris to return their deposits. The petition stated: "We respectfully request the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to forward this petition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ordering the Consulate General in Paris, France, to return our deposits and hand them over to your Bureau for distribution to us. Ding Huanzhang and thirty-two others went to Europe to participate in the war in the fifth year of the Republic [1916]. On February 5th of this year, we were repatriated by the French government on the Platine mail ship and arrived safely in Shanghai on the 11th of this month, receiving your Bureau's thoughtful care, for which we are grateful. However, twenty-three of these thirty-three people have deposits in the Paris Consulate General. Due to the urgency of our departure from France, we were unable to withdraw them. Although we pleaded with the Chinese Consulate in Marseille and sent an airmail letter when the ship docked in Colombo, requesting the Paris Consulate General to telegraph the deposits back to Shanghai to be used as travel expenses for Huanzhang and others to return home, more than a month has passed and we have not yet received them. Now, Huanzhang and others have been unemployed for too long and have no savings. The cost of living in Shanghai is high, and we have no choice but to return to our hometowns as soon as possible to find a new life. In addition to submitting a separate list and specifying the amount of deposits to be retained by your Bureau, we will report our confirmed mailing addresses to your Bureau after we return to our hometowns. Once the deposits are received, please remit them to us individually. We are most grateful. Respectfully submitted."</p>

<h3>Cultural Construction Association Held Regular Board Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Postponement of the First Representative Congress</p>
<p>The China Cultural Construction Association held a standing committee meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 1:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Chen Lifu, Chairman of the Association (represented by Wu Tiecheng); Wu Tiecheng, Vice Chairman; Pan Gongzhan, Standing Director and Secretary-General; and Standing Directors Li Zhaohuan, Li Denghui (represented by Wu Nanxuan), Liu Zhanen, Ou Yuanhuai, Zhang Shuyong, and Pei Fuheng. Zhu Jiahua and Weng Zhilong were excused. Wu Tiecheng chaired the meeting and Huang Jingsu served as the recorder.</p>
<p>After the meeting commenced as scheduled, the Chairman delivered a report, stating that today's meeting was of the Standing Committee of the China Cultural Construction Association. Chairman Chen Wenfu was in urgent need of rest due to illness, and therefore sent a letter entrusting his representation. Since the establishment of the Association, it has been three years, and all work, except for those that have not achieved the original goals or cannot be completed as scheduled due to economic and environmental constraints, the rest of the work has been carried out with great effort. In addition to the written work report, the Secretary-General will also provide a detailed report on the association's revenue and expenditure. The Chairman believed that it is not easy to create a cause. We hope that the association's affairs can be actively promoted and expanded. In order to prevent the Association from becoming a mere facade, it is indispensable to have the assistance and participation of all sectors of society. Because cultural undertakings are very broad, the participation of all sectors of society is necessary to achieve results through joint efforts. Although the association is still in its infancy, as long as we continue to work hard, in ten or fifty years, the association may be an important academic group in China. Because the success of all undertakings is due to the efforts of a few people in the beginning, and then gradually developed and become solid and grand. The Association intends to hold a membership representative conference this year in the hope of participation and joint efforts from all sectors of society. Because in the past three years, the association has branches in various provinces and cities, in order to promote the collection of opinions from all parties and to contact people from all walks of life, it is also necessary to hold this representative conference. I hope that all of you present today will give us some advice.</p>
<p>Then, the Secretary-General of the Association, Pan Gongzhan, reported on the work of the Association and the financial situation. The speech was omitted for brevity. Subsequently, the proposals were discussed:</p>
<p>㊀ The first membership representative conference of the Association was originally scheduled to be held on April 3rd and 4th. Due to the fact that the election of representatives from various branches has not been completed, it is proposed to postpone it and request approval of the date. It was resolved to postpone the conference to July 10th and 11th of this year and to still be held in Shanghai.</p>
<p>㊁ How to proceed with the preparatory matters for the first membership representative conference of the Association? It was resolved that the preparatory matters for the membership representative conference should be urged and actively handled by the Secretary-General. In addition, a special collection of academic papers should be compiled and printed. The Association should formulate regulations for soliciting articles and send them to the directors, members, experts, etc. to write.</p>
<p>㊂ The first phase of the Association's Reading and Advancement Competition has ended. How should the bonus be issued? It was resolved to issue the bonus as usual and to be paid by the Secretary-General from the Association's funds.</p>
<p>㊃ Review of the draft outline of the Association's work plan. It was resolved to appoint five directors, Liu Hongen, Li Denghui, Ou Yuanhuai, Li Zhaohuan, and Pei Fuheng, to review and supplement it together with the Secretary-General, and submit it to the next standing committee meeting for discussion. Mr. Liu Zhanen was requested to convene the meeting.</p>
<p>㊄ The Jiangxi Branch reported that Ding, the director of the branch, had left Ganzhou without permission. It is proposed to appoint Xiong Tianyi as the successor to the position of director to provide leadership. Please review the case. It was resolved to approve the appointment and to put it on record.</p>
<p>㊅ The Qingdao Branch and other branches requested instructions on how to provide travel expenses for the representatives attending the membership representative conference. Please review the case. It was resolved that the Association would provide appropriate subsidies for the travel expenses of the attending representatives. The Secretary-General was requested to prepare a draft budget for the representative conference and submit it to the next standing committee meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>㊅ Due to the vacancies of Standing Directors Shao Yuanchong and Wu Xingya, and the resignation of Shen Pengfei, it is proposed to elect replacements. It was resolved to appoint Zhou Fohai, Wang Yunwu, and Wang Boqi as replacement directors, as well as other routine cases. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan and Others Went to Henan for Disaster Relief Last Night</h3>
<p>Meet with Liu Zhi and Shang Zhen in Kaifeng, then Inspect Various Counties in Western Henan</p>
<p>Zhang Fang, a member of the Central Committee and Chairman of the Henan Relief Committee, came to Shanghai specifically because of the severe drought in Henan Province to ask for assistance from all sectors. The Shanghai Municipal Relief Committee for the Henan Drought was formed to carry out fundraising and relief. The Ministry of Finance first borrowed 100,000 yuan to handle emergency relief. Zhu Qingyu, Lu Bohong, and Mu Ouchu were appointed to go to Henan Province to investigate and provide relief. It is now known that Zhu and others took the Shanghai-Ping Train to Henan at 12:00 last night. The planned itinerary is to first go to Kaifeng to meet with Liu Zhi, Director of the Pacification of Henan and Anhui, and Shang Zhen, Chairman of Henan Province, to discuss relief measures, and then go to various counties in western Henan to investigate and provide relief, and then go to other places for inspection. It is planned to stay in Henan for about two weeks and then return to Shanghai. Zhang originally intended to accompany Zhu and others to Henan for investigation and relief. However, due to the troops stationed in Jiangxi and urgent military affairs to be dealt with, he changed his plan to go to Jiangxi first to handle military affairs, and then go to Henan to join the relief efforts. Therefore, Guo Fangwu, the director of the Luoyang Xingdu Orphanage in the province, was first sent to accompany Zhu and others to investigate and provide relief.</p>
<h3>Request to Revise Income Tax: Capital Tax Assessment</h3>
<p>Shen Liren Submits Suggestions to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>New News Agency reported that Shen Liren, Director Accountant of the China Accounting Firm, submitted a document to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance yesterday to request the revision of the Income Tax Regulations to use the actual amount of capital as the standard for taxation. The document stated, "I hereby submit this document to request the amendment of the Income Tax Regulations, and to present my humble opinions, hoping that you will consider and adopt them.</p>
<p>Since the formal implementation of income tax in our country, the government has lightly taken from the people and enriched the national treasury. The people support good taxes and willingly comply. This shows that the law is good and the intentions are good, and the prospects for taxation are promising. However, upon reviewing Article 3 of Chapter 2 of the Income Tax Regulations, which states that the tax rate should be determined based on the percentage of income to the actual amount of capital, and considering precedents from various countries and the commercial situation in our country, it seems that this is not entirely appropriate. I believe that there is a need for amendment.</p>
<p>I dare to present my humble opinions as follows: According to the income tax calculation methods of advanced countries in Europe and the United States, regardless of the amount of capital, taxes are collected based on the amount of income using a progressive system. The procedures are simple and easy to calculate. In our country, most stores are partnerships with unlimited liability, and the organization of limited liability companies is less common. They often use small capital to do big business, relying on loans from money houses and deposits from relatives and friends as their working capital. If the actual amount of capital is used as the standard for taxation, it does not seem fair. This is the first point that should be amended.</p>
<p>Old-style stores in our country are mostly partnerships with unlimited liability and generally do not have sufficient capital for operation. Managers have to find other ways to cope. When stores have surpluses, in order to consolidate their business foundation and prevent bad debts and price fluctuations, they have to hide a portion of the surplus. Therefore, when a store opens, it only has a capital of several thousand yuan. After several decades, in addition to paying dividends or equivalent bonuses as usual each year, the hidden assets may amount to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands. Capitalists may know about these hidden assets, but because they cannot find out the exact amount, they can only let it go. Now that the income tax rate is based on capital, these types of stores will inevitably find ways to increase capital in order to pay less tax. However, capitalists may not want to contribute more cash. Therefore, the managers will have to reveal all the hidden assets accumulated over the years. When the capitalists see this huge surplus, they will worry about whether they can make a profit by continuing to operate and will advocate for dissolution. This is not speculation, but a fact that has been seen in the past. The reason for this is none other than the influence of the regulations. This is the second point that should be amended.</p>
<p>The salaries and wages of employees in various industries in our country have always been very meager. They rely entirely on the year-end bonus to supplement their income. This method encourages diligence and loyalty, and should not be criticized. Now, because of the income tax regulations and the capital issue, if capital is increased, the percentage of annual surplus compared to capital will inevitably be lower, and the employees' bonus will be smaller. In the future, labor-capital disputes will arise, and it will be difficult to cooperate harmoniously, and the business will be difficult to promote. Since the promulgation of the income tax regulations, research conferences have been held everywhere. The important issues discussed are nothing more than capital and public reserve. If the articles can be amended, the calculation will be simple, and merchants will easily understand, and they will be happy to pay taxes. This is the third point that should be amended.</p>
<p>Calculating income tax based on capital is cumbersome. If capital is reported first and then the amount of income is reported, it is two things done in one, and merchants are afraid of the trouble. For example, in Shanghai, although the deadline has been extended repeatedly, only a few merchants have reported. This is not because merchants do not obey the law, but because the procedures are too complicated. Also, the regulations stipulate that those with capital below 2,000 yuan are exempt from tax. Therefore, some merchants have reduced their capital in the hope of evading taxes. Although some have operated with a capital of tens of thousands of yuan, they are now changing it to less than 2,000 yuan. This is not because merchants dare to break the law, but because the regulations give them an opportunity to take advantage of. If this capital standard can be changed and taxes are levied based on the amount of surplus, it will not only save procedures, but also prevent the abuse of reducing capital to evade taxes. This is the fourth point that should be amended.</p>
<p>According to Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the Income Tax Implementation Rules, "Those with public reserve may calculate one-third of the total amount into capital." However, Item 5 of the Income Tax Collection Instructions states, "The public reserve mentioned in Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the Implementation Rules is limited to the public reserve stipulated by laws and regulations." The statutory public reserve is limited to limited liability companies, and most commercial organizations in our country are partnerships with unlimited liability. Therefore, their public reserve cannot enjoy the same treatment as limited liability companies. This is also unbalanced in terms of justice. This is the fifth point that should be amended.</p>
<p>In summary, the inapplicability of the capital regulations can be proven by facts. Income tax is a good tax, and the regulations should be perfected to prevent loopholes and simplify procedures. Preventing loopholes is the way to enrich tax sources, and simplifying procedures is the way to avoid disturbing the people.</p>
<p>I hope that you, with your high merit and broad mind, will widely collect opinions from the people. I dare to present my humble opinions and contribute my small wisdom. Whether it is appropriate or not, I have prepared this document and respectfully submit it to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance for your consideration and adoption. I am sincerely awaiting your instructions.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Joint Conference of Silk and Cocoon Industry Associations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing Cocoon Purchasing Methods and Requesting Restrictions on Cocoon Exports</p>
<p>The Joint Conference of Silk and Cocoon Industry Associations of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces was held at the Silk Factory Trade Association Hall on North Shansi Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. The meeting discussed various issues such as cocoon purchasing methods for the current spring season. Attendees included Chen Xiaoqing, Xu Haoran, Jing Shaoxin, Wei Shixin, Chen Xie Kun, Ma Yintang, Hu Yinjie from Jiangsu Province, and Jiang Laixian, Zhou Yangsong, Zhang Youyi, Wang Yaquan, Hu Jinxiu, Shen Huachen from Zhejiang Province. Zhu Jing'an and others attended as observers, totaling more than 20 people. Chu Huiseng was elected as the temporary chairman.</p>
<p>After the formalities were completed, the chairman first reported on the status of the cocoon industry in the two provinces. Then the discussion began:</p>
<p>㊀ The cost of modifying and installing drying machines is too high, and the industry's strength is weak and unable to purchase them. How should we provide relief? Resolution: The situations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are different. This case should be submitted separately by Jiangsu. Before drying machines are widely installed, please allow the retention of traditional stoves for relief.</p>
<p>㊁ Cooperatives are using the name of cocoon drying for members to collect cocoons for profit, causing many abuses. How should we take measures to ban this to protect the interests of cocoon farmers and avoid disrupting the control? Resolution: Request the authorities of the two provinces to strictly ban it with effective measures.</p>
<p>㊂ Method for collecting union fees. Resolution: The two provinces will collect fees as usual.</p>
<p>㊃ Establishment of a joint office of silk and cocoon in the two provinces for liaison. Resolution: According to the previous resolution, first establish a joint office of the cocoon industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces. The joint organization of the silk industry in the two provinces should be discussed after seeking consent.</p>
<p>㊄ Proposed request to the governments of the two provinces to order various agricultural fields to expand the cultivation of high-quality mulberry seedlings to develop sericulture. Resolution: Jiangsu Province is already actively carrying out this plan. This case should be submitted separately by Zhejiang to request expansion and unlimited seed distribution as much as possible.</p>
<p>㊅ Proposed request to the sericulture authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to formulate measures to reward private seed production and support its development. Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>㊅ Prescribe the central cocoon price. Resolution: Passed. Request the authorities of the two provinces to prescribe the central cocoon price.</p>
<p>㊇ Now that income tax has been levied, the central government should be requested to abolish the business tax on the cocoon industry to reduce the burden and avoid double taxation. Resolution: Passed. The two provinces will submit separate requests for exemption.</p>
<p>㊈ A letter will be sent to the money industry to request a lighter margin for cocoon collection loans. Resolution: A letter will be sent to the money industry in the two provinces to set the standard at 30% for cocoon collection loans.</p>
<p>㊉ Proposed request to the government to restrict the amount of cocoon exports to avoid endangering the domestic industry. Resolution: Request the central government to consider that even if there is a bumper harvest, exports should be restricted to avoid affecting the domestic industry.</p>
<h3>Settlement of Conditions for British Tram Workers</h3>
<p>Supplementary Retirement Gold Provisions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tram Company, a British-owned company in the Public Concession, had its entire staff of ticket sellers, drivers, machinists, and other workers requesting that the company improve their treatment. Yesterday, Lu Jingshi, a member of the Municipal Party Department, Lu Yinchu, of the Civil Affairs Section, and Yu Yaoxuan, of the Investigation Section, together with Zhu Jintao of the Shanghai General Labor Union and Gong Yuting and others, went to the company's general office on South Suzhou Road to mediate. The company's General Manager Irving, Hu Ziyu, the Chinese comprador, and the heads of the vehicle and machinery departments received them. After consultation, it was decided to supplement two provisions regarding retirement pay:</p>
<p>㊀ Those who have served diligently for 25 years may apply to the company for retirement and be given one month's salary for each year of service, with the remainder extrapolated, but the company may not unreasonably refuse.</p>
<p>㊁ Those who have served diligently for 20 years and have been approved for retirement will be given half a month's salary for each year of service, with the remainder extrapolated. (The above two retirement payments are calculated based on the average actual salary earned over the years, excluding all allowances.)</p>
<p>As for the retirement conditions decided in the last mediation, they will be implemented as usual, and the supplementary conditions will be translated and announced by the company.</p>
<h3>Fish Market Sends Letter to Fisheries Bank to Handle Fishmonger Loans</h3>
<p>Improve Dock Facilities</p>
<p>In order to benefit fishmongers, the Shanghai Fish Market's board of directors has drafted a letter to the Fisheries Banking Group requesting that it allocate funds to handle fishmonger credit cooperatives, small fishmonger loan syndicates, or fishmonger business trust companies. This has been approved by the Ministry of Industry and is currently being planned and implemented by the Fisheries Banking Group. In addition to this, the market has also set up a fishmonger rest room and has successively added corner protections to the four sides of the dock, including triangular wooden steps at the bridge intersections, and placed bridge water cables. The monthly road maintenance fees paid by the fishmonger vehicles have also recently been waived.</p>

<h3>Book Prices Not Easily Reduced</h3>
<p>Paper Prices Soar, Almost Doubling</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Association of this city recently sent a letter to the Book Industry Association of this city, discussing the reduction of textbook prices. It is reported that the members of the association have always kept the prices of teaching materials and books extremely low, in order to reduce the burden on student families. Recently, paper prices have soared. Other industries may have increased prices along with the increase in costs, but the members of the association are currently temporarily maintaining the original prices in order to support education and have not increased them. However, due to the pressure of the situation, there is no way to further reduce them.</p>
<p>It has been learned that their reply to the Municipal Education Association contains the following statements: "Regarding the reduction of book prices, the members have implemented it last year. Before last year, paper prices were low and competition among the industry was fierce, leading to price reductions. Most publishers have been struggling to survive, some have closed down, and some have defaulted on wages. In recent days, paper prices have soared, and printing houses are tightening their belts. Based on current prices, not only can we not reduce prices further, but we fear that we will not be able to avoid increasing prices to maintain operations."</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of book price reductions, the association also received a dispatch from the Ministry of Education forwarded by the Social Affairs Bureau. The association convened a meeting of all executive committee members, who all said that since the unified sales method for primary and secondary school textbooks was stipulated by the Ministry of Education in April of last year, the various bookstores have sold secondary school textbooks at 80% of the original price and primary school education books at 60% of the original price since August of the same year. The book discounts offered by each bookstore were originally not uniform, with some offering no discounts, some offering 95% discounts, and some offering as low as 70% or 80% discounts. Some reprinted ancient books were sold at only 10% of the marked price. Since the implementation of the unified sales method stipulated by the Ministry's order, the original discounts have been reduced across the board and changed to actual prices for sale. Even those who originally had no discounts and whose prices were lower, have mostly been adjusted separately, reducing prices. Price reduction lists were also printed. The Ministry's order instructed to further reduce the prices of primary and secondary school textbooks and to reduce the prices of ordinary books as much as possible, showing the government's thoroughness in promoting culture. However, since the beginning of winter last year, the prices of all commodities have risen, especially the prices of paper and ink, which are the raw materials for books. Compared with before August, they have increased more than double. Since January 15th, various industries in the city have published notices to increase prices, including wire balls, wood villages, knitted refined handkerchief machines, dyeing and weaving, hemp thread, sauce gardens, copper and iron machinery, dyeing silk stockings, silk and satin dyeing workshops, freight trucks, Hangzhou silk brocades, mirror boxes, flannel factories, absorbent cotton cloth, towels, yarn ribbons, biscuits, candies, bread, red cloth head ropes, thermos bottles, bicycle sales, firecrackers, cork, grass flannel hats, foundry factories, coal, incense, candles, electrical manufacturing, hardware, porcelain, blacksmithing, shoe industry, board industry, seasoning manufacturing, gold paint, electrical silk weaving, reed organs, pharmaceutical manufacturing, dental bone equipment, soap making, woodenware, umbrellas, matte yarn threads, dyeing industry, pottery, phonographs, letterpress printing, silk edges, weaving industry, etc., more than 50 industries. Among them, there are even copper weaving machines, foundries, candy biscuits, soap making, and letterpress printing, which have announced two price increases. The relationship between the printing industry and books is particularly close. According to the association's announcement on February 26th of this year, the original prices have been increased by 50%. It can be seen that various books are already in a situation where prices must be increased. Selling at the reduced prices after August of last year has been difficult to sustain. The book industry originally intended to serve culture, and did not dare to request price increases in order to avoid increasing the burden on primary and secondary school students and general readers, when there was still hope that paper prices would fall. The original prices of primary and secondary school textbooks were already very low, and after huge discounts, they have now been changed to the original discounted prices, which have been reduced as much as possible. It is requested that the Social Affairs Bureau forward this information to the Ministry of Education to understand the difficulties of the merchants and exempt them from further reductions. If the prices of raw materials such as paper and ink continue to rise, they should continue to be allowed to increase prices to maintain costs. It has been decided to report the situation accordingly.</p>

<h3>Charity Federation Solicits Clothes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Federation Joint Disaster Relief Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other organizations yesterday, soliciting clothes, stating that it has received a report from Zhuan Nian, a commissioner of the Relief Committee, stating that the Zaobian area has recently been severely disturbed by remnant bandits, and the disaster situation is extremely tragic. The general disaster victims are displaced and have no clothes or food, resembling starving people. The most unbearable thing to describe is that the general disaster victims and girls who are about to reach adulthood are mostly unclothed, or even have no shirts or pants. Their suffering from hunger and cold is truly like a living hell. Please find a way to provide relief as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Accordingly, this letter is sent in the hope that your association will have compassion for these orphaned children and generously donate funds to meet their urgent needs. If you are willing to donate clothing, regardless of whether it is new or old, single-layered, cotton-padded jackets and pants, all that can cover the body is needed. Please donate them as soon as possible and hand them over to the association for distribution and relief to benefit the disaster victims in the border area.</p>
<h3>Italian National Sentenced for Fraud</h3>
<p>The Italian national, Kang Qini, was accused of impersonating the head of the Public Concession's anti-narcotics police squad and defrauding a Chinese man in Murongming Road of 400 yuan. The Italian Consul General's court in Shanghai found him guilty on Sunday and sentenced him to eight months in prison and a fine of 656 lire (Italian currency). He was also ordered to be deported during his prison term.</p>
<p>According to the case, on February 16, the defendant colluded with a Chinese man to go to a residence on Murongming Road, claiming that he and his companions were secret agents from the police station searching for heroin and red pills. At that time, a woman in the house was panicked and agreed to pay 400 yuan to avoid being taken to the police station. The Chinese man was soon arrested by a secret agent from the Jing'an Temple Road police station and has been punished by the court according to law. The Italian national also surrendered to the police station after the incident.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Robbery at Zhengjia Bridge, Liuxian Village at Noon</h3>
<p>Zhou Fugui Suffered a Loss of Approximately 8,000 to 9,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Zhou Baogui, a Ningbo native, has been running the Xieshunchang Cotton Cloth Store on Zhengjia Wooden Bridge Street, Caishi Street (south-facing) for over ten years. Business has been good, with a surplus. His family resides at No. 3, Lane 1, No. 97, Chujia Bridge North Bank, Lian Ti Ni Yin Road, in the first lane of Liuxian Village, a three-story building. Recently, Zhou opened a branch store in Nanyang Bridge, which just opened the day before yesterday. Yesterday at 12:10 PM, Zhou returned home for lunch. The maid was just serving the meal, and the errand boy from the old store on Zhengjia Wooden Bridge Street returned home to deliver rice through the back alley. Unexpectedly, six robbers followed him in. Four of them held Mauser pistols, threatening the victim to remain silent and driving the schoolgirl and the maid into the living room, where they were guarded by two robbers. The remaining robbers went upstairs, ransacking drawers and chests, engaging in wanton looting. They demanded the mistress's jewelry box and locksmith, injuring her left hand in the process. The looting lasted an hour. Before leaving, the robbers took off their old cotton gowns and exchanged them for the looted fox-trimmed, gray squirrel, and sherisun fur coats. They also wrapped the stolen crepe around their waists. They then fled with the stolen clothing and accessories through the back alley. The loot included over 400 yuan in cash, two diamond rings, four gold rings, three gem rings, gold lockets, small gold foreign coins, and silk and fur clothing, totaling about 8,000 to 9,000 yuan. Afterward, the authorities were notified, and detectives from the French Concession police station came to investigate. The five pieces of clothing left behind by the robbers were taken back to the police station for investigation.</p>

<h3>A Young Woman Jumps into the River Due to Marital Unhappiness</h3>
<p>A Letter of Complaint Found</p>
<p>Xu Guifang, a local from Mugou Bridge in Tangqiao Town, Pudong, who works at a paper mill, married a woman named Zheng from the same town through a matchmaker years ago. At the beginning of their marriage, the couple's relationship was harmonious. However, Xu Jinfang was naturally dissolute and did not engage in honest work. His wife tried to persuade him, but was instead beaten and scolded. Later, Xu became lazy and unwilling to work, causing him to be laid off from the factory. With no income and a long period of idleness, the family was in dire straits, and he often forced his wife to borrow money from her family. If she occasionally failed to do so, she would be beaten. A few days ago, Xu Jinfang again asked his wife to borrow money from her mother's family. Because she was slow to respond, she was severely beaten. Xu Zheng thought she had married the wrong person, lamented her misfortune, and felt that life was worse than death. Yesterday afternoon around 1 PM, she jumped into the river at the Mud Ferry Pier in Pudong to commit suicide. A police officer noticed her and quickly called a boat to rescue her. They found an oilcloth package near the woman, which contained a letter of complaint. (The content is omitted). She was sent to the Tangqiao Police Station, where the above facts were investigated. A document was prepared and sent to the General Bureau for verification.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Driver Conspires to Kidnap a Young Master; Case Concluded</h3>
<p>Police Lawyer Requests Severe Punishment; Court Schedules Sentencing for the 19th</p>
<p>Yang Rongfu, a Wuxi native and owner of the Dayu Porcelain Shop at 130 Quai du Mail, French Concession, had his six-year-old son, Huiqi, kidnapped and hidden by Cai Fu, the hired rickshaw driver, and Shen, his accomplice, on January 27th of this year at 10 AM. They demanded 3,000 yuan for ransom. Yang agreed to pay 1,000 yuan as ransom, but when he went to pay, no one appeared to receive the money, so the matter was delayed. Later, Zhang Yun嘅, a tailor, found out and falsely claimed to be a kidnapper.</p>
<p>Posing as the Kidnapper</p>
<p>He sent a letter to Yang, demanding 1,000 yuan and arranged to meet at the Zhongnan Hotel to receive the ransom. Yang, fearing it was a trap, reported it to the French Concession police, who arrested Zhang and investigated. This led to the arrest of the kidnappers Cai Fuxing, Wu Jinshu, Shi Dehong, and suspect Chen Shoupeng. After investigation by the Special Second Court, the kidnappers, realizing that the main perpetrators had been caught, sent the hostage Yang Huiqi back home safely. After a thorough investigation by the French Concession police, Chen Shouming and Shi Dehong, who were not involved in the case, were released. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution against Cai Fuxing and Wu Jinshu for extortion, and against Zhang Yunxiang for intimidation and fraud. Judge Chen Shuoying conducted repeated hearings, summoned the victim to court, and appointed a defense lawyer for further hearings. This newspaper has previously reported on these events. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, Judge Chen presided over the continued hearing in Criminal Court One. The victim, Yang Rongfu's wife, Yang Ma氏,</p>
<p>Brought the Victim</p>
<p>Yang Huiqi, the hostage, to court. After the court questioned him about the kidnapping, Cai and Wu confessed to conspiring to kidnap and extort the ransom. Zhang Yunqing also admitted to impersonating the kidnapper to commit fraud. The court, finding the evidence clear, opened the debate. The police lawyer Fei Xizhen argued that the first defendant had worked for the victim's family for over a year and should have</p>
<p>Protected the Young Master</p>
<p>Instead, he conspired with the first defendant to kidnap and extort the ransom. He should be given the most severe punishment to serve as a warning. The other defendants should also be severely punished according to the law. After the defendants' pro bono lawyer made their defense, the court declared the debate closed and scheduled sentencing for 9 AM on the 19th. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Chinese Ratepayers Association Writes to the Shanghai Municipal Council Not to Obstruct Legitimate Requests</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association sent a letter to the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "According to a letter from lawyer Wang Xintang, our clients Zhou Peizhang and Zhou Peifu stated that they jointly own a Hua Hu (Chinese household) deed for land at No. 241, Chen Ziwei, 12 Tu, 13 Bao, Yinxiang District, totaling 3.783 mu (approximately 0.6 acres) (formerly known as Heilong Road, also known as Helong Road, currently known as Hangzhou Road, south of Qing Road, east of the land). In 1935, it was leased to the Wufeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory. Now, the Wufeng Factory intends to construct buildings on the land and applied to the Shanghai Municipal Council for a construction permit. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council delayed issuing the permit, citing that our client had not paid land tax, which affects our client's income. This is unusual. This land has been paying grain and taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau for years. Since it is not a deed, why should it be required to pay land tax? We feel this request is inappropriate. Should Chinese people's private land, in addition to fulfilling the obligation to pay taxes to the Chinese government, also be subject to extra burdens to the concession authorities? Nothing could be more inappropriate. If this precedent is set, all Chinese-owned lands in the concession that wish to build houses will be subject to the control of the Shanghai Municipal Council. How can the government protect the integrity of the people's sovereignty? We specially request that the Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association seriously negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council and immediately issue the construction permit. We await your favorable reply." The Association states, "According to legal principles, it is clear that the deed land has no obligation to pay land tax to your bureau. Building on the land is not under the jurisdiction of your bureau. Applying to your bureau for a construction permit is a matter of courtesy. Whether or not the permit is issued has no legal impact. As for access to the deed land, the right of way is publicly recognized and should not be obstructed in any way. Otherwise, it would be an illegal act." In light of the above, we request that your bureau treat the matter with courtesy within the bounds of the law.</p>
<h3>National Goods Factory Joint Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Union held its 15th regular meeting yesterday, chaired by Lu Xingzhuang. The following matters were resolved: ⑴ Regarding the dispute at the Yongliang Electric Factory, the two committee members, Shi Jiuyun and Zhou Shixuan, who were previously appointed to investigate, only saw two sets of accounts from the factory, those of 1924 and 1936, which listed capital accounts. The factory will be asked to submit the general clearance books and cash flow records for 1935 within three days to determine whether it is a fully Chinese-owned capital. ⑵ The factories participating in the Hangzhou Goods Exhibition were notified to load and depart on the 18th of this month. Other matters were also discussed.</p>
<h3>After Dissolving Engagement, the Woman's Family Sues for Losses</h3>
<p>The Man and Woman Met and Socialized Repeatedly; Unexpectedly, the Man Changed His Mind Over Time</p>
<p>Chen Quanfa, a local resident of 584 Haifang Road, betrothed his 18-year-old daughter Chen Lingdi to Gu Mingguan, the son of Gu Genfa, the former general manager of the Nanyang Automobile Company at 57, Lane 88, Changping Road, through a matchmaker in 1928. Many years have passed, but they have not yet married. Last year, Mingguan, feeling that he was an adult and dissatisfied with the marriage arranged by his parents, filed a petition with the Special First Court to dissolve the engagement, which was approved. Now, Chen Quanfa has also hired lawyer Pan Zhe to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Special First Court against Gu Genfa and Gu Mingguan, father and son, seeking compensation for material and emotional losses, and requesting litigation assistance. The case was heard yesterday morning in Civil Court Seven by Judge Xu Gongdian, who was presiding over the case. Chen Quanfa testified that his daughter Lingdi was betrothed to Gu Mingguan in 1928. At the beginning of the matchmaking process, he knew that the poor and rich were not a good match and wanted to refuse. However, Gu Genfa believed that those from poor backgrounds were better because they could endure hardship and be thrifty and not extravagant, so he insisted on having his daughter as a daughter-in-law, and he agreed. Later, Gu was fortunate in speculative business and became a wealthy man in Shanghai, while he was unemployed and fell into poverty, leading to Gu's contempt. The most painful thing was that the defendant had long harbored other intentions, but on the surface, he not only did not make it clear early on, but also deliberately insisted on socializing with his daughter first to observe her personality, causing his daughter to accompany Mingguan to watch movies, visit parks, and even do unreasonable things. She dared not speak, like swallowing a bitter gourd. Unexpectedly, the defendant changed his mind and sued for dissolution of the engagement. Since the approval, she has suffered deeply and attempted suicide several times. At the time of the engagement, he also lost more than 900 yuan in banquets and other expenses. At the same time, he requested a judgment ordering compensation, etc. The defendant also hired a lawyer to appear in court and request the dismissal of the plaintiff's lawsuit, arguing that according to Shanghai customs, no banquets were held at the time of the engagement, so there were no losses. Moreover, the defendant had never met the plaintiff's daughter, etc. After the lawyers of both parties debated, the court adjourned the hearing to the 19th.</p>

<p>Zhang Hongguang, an Anhui native residing at No. 16, Tongyu Lane, West Guangfu Road, Shanghai, was working at Longhua on the 13th of this month, digging mud, when he found a bomb buried during the January 28th Shanghai Incident. He took it home, intending to sell it to a junk collector, but failed. Zhang then arbitrarily played with it. Due to carelessness, the bomb fell to the ground and exploded with a loud bang. Zhang himself was killed in the explosion. In addition to Zhang's death, there were five other men and women who were watching, all of whom were injured at the same time. The injured included Meng Ziqing (32 years old), Wang Duojin (32 years old), Li Li氏 (35 years old), Wang Yang氏 (24 years old), and Pu Shi氏 (33 years old), all from Anhui.

Meng Ziqing and Li Li氏 died due to their severe injuries. The hospital reported the deaths to the Lao Zha Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The two corpses were then transported to the corpse examination center on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Tang to the center to examine the corpses. According to the report from the Chinese Police Chief Lu Dagong, Mr. Tang concluded that the deceased Li Li氏 (female) and Meng Ziqing (male) had died from bomb injuries sustained while alive. Li Li氏's corpse was handed over to her husband, Li Binghe, for burial, and Meng Ziqing's corpse was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial.

<h3>After the Death of Yao Yinsun, Manager of Lao Jie Fu, Granddaughter Disputes Inheritance</h3>
<p>Inheriting on Behalf of Mother Under Current Law; The Facts of the Case Were Investigated After Yesterday's Summons</p>
<p>Yao Yinsun, a shareholder and manager of the Lao Jie Fu Silk Shop on Nanjing Road, Anhui Province, died of illness on July 30 last year, leaving behind a considerable fortune. He had one son and one daughter. His son, Zuiting, married a woman of the Hu family, who bore him a son, Kecheng, and two daughters, Luyun and Biyun. His daughter married into the Huang family and gave birth to three daughters, Huang Xiuqin, Suqin, and Qiqin. As Yao Yinsun's son Zuiting and daughter Huang Yao氏 both died before Yao Yinsun,</p>
<p>All Inheritance</p>
<p>Was inherited by his daughter-in-law Yao Hu氏 and her children. However, Yao Yinsun's granddaughter, Huang Xiuqin, stated that although her mother had died, according to current law, a granddaughter can inherit her maternal family's property on behalf of her mother. Therefore, she hired lawyers Gao Junxiang and Zhao Chuanding to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against her cousins Yao Kecheng, Yao Luyun, and Yao Biyun, seeking a division of the inheritance. Because the Yao siblings are</p>
<p>Still Minors</p>
<p>Yao Hu氏 was listed as the legal representative. According to their investigation, their maternal grandfather Yao Yinsun left the following properties: ⑴ One-third of the houses in Yongyu Lane and Xianglin Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, Shanghai. ⑵ Real estate in Wucheng Town and Qiaoyang Town, South Xiang, Xiuning, Anhui Province, worth about 40,000 yuan. ⑶ A five-bay, three-courtyard house in Wucheng Zhong Street, with an empty plot of land of about one and a half mu. ⑷ A two-bay, two-courtyard house and a tea garden in Wucheng Yangjia Lane. ⑸</p>
<p>Six bays on Wucheng Zhong Street</p>
<p>Shop houses at the entrance of the pawnshop lane. ⑹ Farmland and real estate in Jiucheng Town and Qiaoyang Town. ⑺ A deposit of 40,000 yuan in the Jintai Qianzhuang in Shanghai. ⑻ A deposit of 40,000 yuan in the Lao Jie Fu Silk Shop. ⑼ 30,000 yuan in Lao Jie Fu shares. (10) 1,000 yuan in shares of the Silk Industry Bank. (11) 1,800 yuan in shares of the Xianghua Electric Company. (12) 500 yuan in shares of the Hongchang Air Conditioning Company. (13) All movable properties in the Yinsun Mansion at No. 7 Zhenyu Lane, Haining Road, Shanghai, etc. According to the above investigation, the plaintiff is legally entitled to</p>
<p>One-sixth</p>
<p>Of the inheritance. Please order the allocation of the plaintiff's inheritance for management. The case was heard yesterday in the Civil Court Seven of the Special Court by Judge Xu Taiyu. The defendants also hired lawyers Zhu Chuanbi and Zhang Zhengxue to appear in court on their behalf, and Yao Hu氏 also appeared in court. According to her defense, at the time of the plaintiff's mother's death, there were no laws on female inheritance. Before his death, Yinsun had made a will stipulating that each granddaughter would receive 2,000 yuan upon marriage, and the remainder would be inherited by the grandson. Therefore, the plaintiff's request is</p>
<p>Difficult to Accept</p>
<p>Moreover, the estate of Mr. Yin is not as large as the plaintiff claims. There is only 10,000 yuan in shares of the Wuhua Silk Factory, 1,800 yuan in shares of the Hankou Water and Electricity Company, 1,000 yuan in shares of the Yuhua Real Estate Company, houses on Yangshi Street, Hangzhou, worth about 1,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan in savings in the Silk Industry Bank, 4,000 yuan in loans from Chen Shilan, a five-bay, two-courtyard house in Wucheng, and two other houses, 80 dan of grain fields, etc. There are no savings or shares in Lao Jie Fu, etc. The court believed that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Japanese Smuggling Copper Coins for Export</h3>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Considers It Dishonorable</p>
<p>The Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News reported that recently, the price of copper has soared, and the smuggling of copper coins has occurred frequently. On the morning of the 15th, the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru was about to export. A Japanese person secretly carried 130 yuan in copper coins, weighing about 500 pounds, onto the ship. There were dozens of others who also secretly carried many copper coins. All were discovered by customs inspectors and police. After being reprimanded, they shamefully disembarked. This kind of speculative behavior not only brings dishonor to law-abiding Japanese people in Shanghai but also indirectly affects Sino-Japanese trade.</p>

<h3>Hunan Steamer Rescues Abducted Young Woman</h3>
<p>Zhang A Yuan rescued midway, Investigator exposes the abductor</p>
<p>Zhang A Yuan, a young woman from Kunshan, is 18 years old and still has a pretty face. Her father died early, and her mother lives in her original home of Lujia Bang, struggling as a farmer. Last December, A Yuan came to Shanghai alone and lived in her cousin's house at No. 41 Xinping Lane, Longmen Road, in the Public Concession. A week ago, she happened to go to the Yong'an Company's theater to watch a play, where she met two unknown men. One was over forty years old, and the other was only in his twenties. The younger one saw that A Yuan was alone and gradually started chatting with her, showing great concern. A Yuan was indeed captivated. The three left the theater and went out for dinner. The older man also coaxed and seduced her. As a result, A Yuan went with the younger man to the older man's house in the Baxianqiao area of the French Concession and spent the night. The younger man claimed to have a clothing store in Tianjin and was willing to marry her. With sweet words and promises, A Yuan's heart was moved. Soon, the young man pretended to say goodbye to return to Tianjin, and the older man volunteered, very willing to help with the good deed, claiming that his name was Zhang A Da, and the young man was a wealthy friend. This time he came to Shanghai for business, and he could act as a matchmaker to accompany her to Tianjin to get married and live together. A Yuan, at this point, thought of her own lonely life, and having such a husband, she happily agreed. She stayed at Zhang A Da's house for four or five days, and they agreed to go to the Taikoo Company's Beiyang Line Hunan steamer at the Bund in the French Concession at 9 am yesterday, accompanied by Zhang, to take the steerage to Tianjin. Zhang then went ashore to buy goods on eight names, taking the opportunity to hide. As the ship was about to set sail, it happened that Chen Shao Ting and Lin Yong Fang, investigators from the China Relief Association for Women and Children, together with Wang Hai Quan and other three detectives from the Customs Water Police Station, boarded the ship to investigate. They saw that A Yuan's demeanor was suspicious and asked where she was going. A Yuan said she was going to Tianjin to find her brother. The detectives asked again where her brother lived. A Yuan stared blankly and could not answer, only taking out a piece of paper given by Zhang, on which was written No. 1, Yiwan Lane, 31st Road, French Concession, Tianjin. At this point, the detectives knew that she had been abducted, but she was still infatuated and unaware. They asked who she was going with. A Yuan replied, Zhang A Da. The detectives knew that Zhang A Da was a famous old abductor, so they immediately searched the entire ship to arrest him, but he had already hidden. So they took her back to the police station and explained the situation repeatedly. A Yuan finally realized and was deeply regretful. According to her confession, the detectives rushed to the French Concession to arrest Zhang A Da, but could not find him. The police chief ordered Zhang A Yuan to be handed over to the Relief Association to be cared for while waiting for her mother to claim her, and ordered a strict search for the abductor to be brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Husband Favors Concubine, Wife Commits Suicide Out of Jealousy</h3>
<p>Feng Cen Shi, a woman from Guangdong, was 34 years old. Her husband, Feng Cu Ming, worked as a railway police officer. He also had a concubine, and the three lived together at No. 25, Lane 521, Bazi Road. Initially, they lived in peace, but recently the concubine returned to her hometown in Guangdong and had been gone for over a hundred days. She only came to Shanghai a week ago. Feng showed even more affection for her and treated his wife coldly. On the evening of the 14th of this month, Cen Shi became jealous and had an argument with her husband. By the next morning, she was extremely frustrated and suddenly had the thought of ending her life. She secretly went out and bought a bottle of poison, and after returning home, she swallowed it and committed suicide behind people's backs. After her family discovered it, they immediately accompanied her to Shanghai Liaoyang Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she soon died. The hospital reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which ordered Detective Chen Xi Kang to go to investigate. He then carried the body to the Philan Road Morgue for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, Inspector Tang, commissioned by the First Special Court, arrived at the morgue and confirmed the body. He then instructed the deceased's husband, Feng Zhong Ming, to collect the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Sues for Divorce, Judge Recommends Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Chen Wang Gui Juan, a young woman from Dinghai, is 20 years old this year. Two years ago, she was married to Chen Gen Fa in her hometown through a matchmaker. Recently, she hired Lawyer Shi Dao of Huyan Road and filed a petition for divorce with the Civil Court of the District Court. The petition stated that the plaintiff had lost her parents at a young age and was raised by her aunt through hard work. When she grew up, she was fortunate enough to find work and live frugally. Her mother listened to the Chen family's deception and promised the plaintiff to the defendant as his first wife. The plaintiff deeply appreciated having a place to call home after drifting through life, so after marrying into the Chen family two years ago, she did her best as a wife. However, the defendant was fond of wandering and spent his days seeking pleasure outside. The plaintiff repeatedly advised him, but was instead beaten. Her in-laws also protected their son. During the first month of the lunar calendar last year, because the defendant's demands were not met, she was beaten and injured by the defendant and her in-laws. The neighbors were indignant and sent the plaintiff to the Red Cross for treatment. The in-laws went to the hospital and refused to allow the plaintiff to return home. Left with no choice, she returned home to her mother. Unexpectedly, the defendant and others hired a lawyer to send a letter accusing the plaintiff of running away and threatened her. The mother and daughter were timid and dared not resist. Just when they were in a hurry, the defendant suddenly realized he was in the wrong and asked someone to persuade the plaintiff to return home, promising not to abuse her again. The plaintiff then returned home, but soon it became even worse. She silently endured the hardship and pain, hoping to win him back. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 27th of last month, the mother-in-law suddenly came to the plaintiff's room when no one was home and tried to assault her. The plaintiff refused to submit at the cost of her life, which angered her. She instead incited the defendant to accuse the plaintiff of improper behavior and locked the plaintiff in the room. The plaintiff wanted to commit suicide, but could not bear to leave her elderly mother, so she found a way to write a letter and mail it to the post office, asking her mother for help. On January 30th of this year, the mother arrived and found the plaintiff still locked in the room. The mother opened the door and rescued her to her residence. The defendant then gathered several gangsters to the residence, broke down the door, and beat them without asking questions. The mother and daughter screamed for help. The owner of the residence heard this and called the police. The defendant and others had already fled. The French police sent the plaintiff and her mother to Guangci Hospital for treatment and arrested the defendant's father, transferring him to the Second Special Court. As a result, he was fined 100 yuan. The plaintiff thought that she had been married to the defendant for less than two years, and the suffering she had endured was unspeakable. The days ahead were long, and her life was in danger. Therefore, she filed for divorce and requested alimony of 495 yuan. After receiving the petition, the court, at 3 pm that afternoon, convened a court session presided over by Judge Wang to summon and question them. The plaintiff, Chen Wang Gui Juan, and her agent lawyer arrived in court to testify about the past. The defendant, Chen Gen Fa, arrived in court and testified that he was 20 years old, from Dinghai, and lived at No. 24, Nancaojiazhai, Kainalu Road, and worked as a cook. He also testified that he did not abuse her. The plaintiff originally worked as a helper in a foreigner's house. After she married me, I did not allow her to continue doing that job, so she was not on good terms with me and often used excuses to return to her natal home for several months. I advised her, but she argued with me. Unexpectedly, she fabricated accusations that I teased her, hoping to achieve her wishes. I do not want a divorce and request to live together. The judge obtained the testimony and considered that the jurisdiction of this case was still in question. It was best to invite relatives and friends to mediate and reconcile the parties. Both parties listened to the advice and left the court.</p>
<h3>A Japanese Man Comes to Shanghai, Loses His Job, and Spends His Days Living and Eating for Free</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily, Sanosuke Yubino, a 26-year-old from Yuasa Town, Arida District, Wakayama Prefecture, came to Shanghai from Zhifu on February 17 to find a job with his friend's aunt. Unexpectedly, the person he was looking for was "missing." He pleaded with the Japanese Consul General to introduce him to a job. On the 5th of this month, he stayed at the Qiujiang Road Baode Lane Qiujiang Hotel. Because he was penniless and had no money to pay the bill, the hotel expelled him. He was forced to wander the streets and alleys. However, driven by hunger, he entered the Guangcheng Restaurant next to the Shanghai Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road. After eating his fill, he tried to escape, but the store chased him out and called the police, who brought him to the police station and extradited him to the Consul General's office. After being reprimanded by the Consul General, he was sent to the Yishuan Relief Center.</p>
<h3>Jade Exhibition Continues to Attract Large Crowds After Extension</h3>

Because the order was very good, visitors were able to fully appreciate the exhibits. Representatives Liang Dong, Tang Xifen, and Ma Keqing, dispatched by the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Education of the Executive Yuan, were accompanied by Shen Xiongqing, a representative of the Shanghai Social Bureau, to review the exhibits and praised them greatly. The exhibition will end on the 20th and will not be extended to conclude it.</p>
<h3>The Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau Sends Personnel to Anhui for Investigation</h3>
<p>Zheng Bao Zhao, Director of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, was dispatched by the Ministry to Guangdong Province a month ago to investigate the rice shortage situation. After returning, he carefully drafted a report and recommendations to the Ministry, and successively sent personnel to Fujian for investigation and established a transportation investigation training class. He has been quite active in the Bureau's affairs. A reporter from the Central News Agency learned that Kezhang Hong Rui Tao and others have been appointed and will go to Anhui Province for investigation within days.</p>
<h3>Haiheng Breaks a Rowboat</h3>
<p>Two Passengers Die</p>
<p>The Haiheng steamer, operated by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the Hong Kong-Shanghai route, arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 the night before. While passing through the Pudong Yangjing Port outside the Huangpu River, it collided with a rowboat numbered 847, which was carrying three passengers across the river from Pudong. The two sides could not avoid each other, and the rowboat was cut in two. The four passengers and boatmen all fell into the river. Nearby boatmen rushed to rescue them. In the darkness, they only rescued boatman Liu Cheng He and Zhang Li Shi, an elderly woman from Gaoyou, and one passenger. They quickly pulled him up, but he had already suffocated from drinking too much water and died. One passenger was still missing. After the accident, the Haiheng continued to the Jinliyuan Wharf at the 16th pier to dock. The Customs Water Police Station dispatched Detective Li Wen Qi to investigate after the accident. He saw that the body that was pulled up was wearing a black fake serge camel hair robe, black maoge pants, coffee-colored socks, and shoes had fallen off. He had a flat top and was about thirty years old. There was a leather wallet beside him containing a pawn ticket worth three yuan and two letters from home addressed to her husband, Sen Lin, from someone named Li Ai Lian. The first letter briefly stated that the family's needs were urgent and asked her husband to review the payment immediately. The second letter said that the five yuan had been received and urged her husband to work hard in Shanghai and take care of his health. Two pieces of luggage were also recovered, containing a gray fake serge jacket, a black-gray guige pants, a white health shirt, a white shorts, and a gray fake serge short shirt. The missing passenger was identified as Liu Guang Li, a 30-year-old from Yangzhou, living at No. 92, North Yangjing Road, Pudong, making a living by making shoes. This small shoemaker also died in the Huangpu River. His only relative was his cousin Liu Guang Jin, and he had no wife or children. The detective verified the case and brought the boatman Liu Cheng He and the unidentified corpse to the police station. According to Liu, he was 61 years old, from Shandong, and lived alone, living on the rowboat day and night. He was still shirking responsibility for the accident. The police chief determined that the case involved human lives and sentenced him to the District Court for disposition. The corpse was taken to the Salvation Bureau for examination and was prepared with a coffin and stored, waiting for family members to claim it.</p>
<h3>Hu Yunhai Falls into Huangpu River and Dies</h3>
<p>Worker Angered by Cruel Foreman, Water Police Station Sends to Court</p>
<p>At 8 pm the night before, the Changjiang-class Jiangxin steamer docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was loading cargo. A worker named Hu Yunhai was carrying a bag of sugar from the outer iron barge onto the ship along the gangplank. At that time, the foreman Lin Jin Lai, blocked Hu because the workers on the ship did not have time to stack it. Lin instructed him to delay boarding. Unexpectedly, Hu suddenly fell into the Huangpu River and could not be rescued, resulting in a tragic death. The body sank without a trace. At the time, co-workers Chen Zheng Yang, Liu Jia Bao, Zhao Ji Cai, and others believed that Lin pushed him too hard, causing the accident, so they started fighting, accusing Lin of being too fierce. They twisted him and beat him. Another foreman, Tong Zhi Yu, persuaded them to stop. Chen and others reported to the Xiaodongmen French Police Station and arrested Lin. After questioning, it was determined that the case occurred on the water, so yesterday morning, they notified the Customs Water Police Station, which sent Detective Jin Gui Fu to take the witnesses back for questioning. The defendant, Lin Jin Lai, denied pushing hard. The police chief determined that the case involved human lives and summoned a new witness, Cui Xiao Wu Zi, and together with all the witnesses, was sent to the District Court for questioning yesterday afternoon. It is said that the deceased was fifteen years old, from Anhui. His family only had his elderly mother, Wang, and the situation was extremely tragic.</p>
<h3>Abandoned After Seduction, Defendant Accused of Obscenity</h3>
<p>Yan Xiu Lan, a local woman living on Yongxing Road and Deli in Zhabei, is 29 years old, beautiful, and still unmarried. Last summer, Zhao Ji Ren (also known as Zhang Gen), the young owner of the Zhao De Ji hemp rope shop located at No. 64, Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road, saw her and was amazed by her beauty. He immediately pursued her and eventually seduced her with sweet words. They opened Room 5 in the Baoshan Hotel for a tryst. After their passionate affair, they agreed to marry her, and a lucky day was chosen for the wedding. Unexpectedly, the beautiful scene did not last long. The two were together for only six months when Zhao suddenly fell in love with someone else and forgot his old love. After Yan Xiu Lan found out, she repeatedly negotiated with Zhao to fulfill the marriage contract, but Zhao avoided her. She finally realized that she had been deceived and told her mother, Yan Zhu Shi, the whole story. Her beloved daughter's innocence was tarnished, and she suffered the pain of being abandoned after seduction. Her lifelong happiness was lost. Extremely angry, she, in the capacity of her daughter's legal representative, hired Lawyer Yang Xun to file a lawsuit in the First Special District District Court, accusing Zhao Ji Ren of obscenity. After the Special District Court reviewed the case, it determined that the crime scene was located in the Chinese territory, so it transferred the case to the Nanshi District Court for handling. At 10 am yesterday morning, Judge Lu Hong Yi presided over the court session. The plaintiff, Yan Zhu Shi, accompanied by her daughter Yan Xiu Lan and their representative lawyer, arrived in court to testify about the past and requested a strict investigation. The judge obtained the testimony. Because the defendant Zhao Ji Ren did not arrive, he ordered a postponement for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Omega Waterproof Watch Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The world-famous Omega watch factory's invention of waterproof watches has now arrived in Shanghai, managed by Baoxin Foreign Company at No. 3210, Jiangxi Road. This waterproof watch has been rigorously tested by the Geneva Municipal Authority. An Omega waterproof watch, two empty watch cases, and three other types of waterproof watches were boiled in boiling water at F188 degrees for five minutes, then placed in the Geneva River at a depth of 2210 feet (C5 degrees) and taken out after half an hour. As a result, the Omega waterproof watch kept accurate time and no water leaked in. The other watches were damaged and could not be used.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Race Club Regularly Holds Joint Competitions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Race Club, in view of the Jiangwan International Sports Association's decision to cancel its annual competition originally scheduled for the 27th, 28th, and 29th of this month and the 1st of April, decided that it would be a waste of the good spring weather to not take advantage of the good times. It is now scheduled to hold an Easter joint competition on the 27th, 29th of this month and the 3rd of April to make up for the deficiency. The program is special and full of excitement, such as two joint new horse races each day, one joint grand competition on the second day, and one joint champagne race on the third day. It is stipulated that those who occupy the top two or three positions during the race period are qualified to be selected for the champagne race. In addition, in the old horse handicap race, those who have won more than 5,500 yuan in prizes last year are not allowed to participate, which is particularly novel. Therefore, even the good horses that are sure to win the championship have to withdraw and give way, so the lesser horses have a chance to exhale. It is also a good strategy to equalize the winning rights of each horse.</p>
<p>This Saturday is the Shanghai Race Club's second special competition. The program is roughly the same as before. After studying the races from last Saturday, it is not difficult for researchers to follow the clues.</p>
<h3>Chen Lisheng Widely Forms Ink Bonds</h3>

For more than 30 years, he has explored the origins and mysteries of ancient and modern calligraphy styles, drawing on the strengths of many schools. He is particularly good at bikeshub calligraphy, with its majestic vigor, which is admired by those who see it. In the past, when there were disasters in the north and south, he repeatedly donated his calligraphy to help the disaster relief efforts. For a time, the art world cherished his work, and paper was as valuable as gold in Luoyang. Those who seek his calligraphy can ask for specific styles and requests, and he satisfies them all. Now, with the leisure of his business, he has a refined interest in calligraphy. Friends have re-established affordable rates for him, hoping to widely form ink bonds. The major stationery and fan shops in this city and Wang's residence at No. 9, Lane 136, Wuxi Road, can all collect calligraphy requests on his behalf.</p>

<h3>Modern Politics and China (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Junshan</p>
<p>In today's countries, whether they appear to be democratic or monarchical, their essence is nothing more than the rule of law and party rule. This fact also illustrates that no country today can be separated from group rule politics and leader politics. What does this mean? Because today the whole world has only sixty-two countries, thirty-seven are republics, and twenty-five are kingdoms. And we usually only see eight major countries, namely: England, America, Japan, Soviet Russia, France, Italy, Turkey, and Germany. So without looking at how other countries' political forms and political essence are, we can see everything by taking these eight major countries as representatives. Everyone should know that the world has a total population of 1.8 billion to 2 billion. These eight countries rule 1.1 billion people - if we add China, there are more than 1.5 billion people. Therefore, we can get the truth of modern world politics by using this as a representative. Among the eight major countries, some are democratic republics, and some are constitutional monarchies, but whether their external form is monarchy or democracy, the essence of their politics is either group rule politics or leader politics. For example, in monarchical countries, England and Japan are group rule politics - party politics, that is, multi-party politics, while Italy is leader politics - one-party politics. But if we look at democratic countries, we can also find group rule politics and leader politics. Like the United States and France, this is group rule politics under democratic politics: while Russia and Germany are leader politics under democratic politics. Therefore, we can find the same group rule politics and leader politics from these two very different political forms - democratic politics can produce group rule politics and leader politics, and monarchical politics also produces group rule politics and leader politics. This shows that modern politics has no distinction between monarchy and democracy, only the difference between group rule politics and leader politics: that is, the difference between multi-party politics and one-party politics. What is multi-party politics? It means that many political parties manage a country's politics by waxing and waning each other. What is one-party politics? It means that only one political party manages the politics of a country. Understanding this meaning means understanding the trend of world politics, which is very important.</p>

The opening prices for March and April were about 0.02 yuan better. With the sharp rise in foreign wheat, the flour market only improved by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. The reason for this is not difficult to guess. This month will soon need to be delivered, and the actual sales market is still scattered, with no wholesale packaging. Therefore, in the stability of various months, it is still difficult to rebound. Until the afternoon opening, the actual demand did not move, and there was slight sales, and the receiving party still waited and watched, causing the asking price to soften again. July and August, because the factory did not issue, the bulls pulled up, and it was good by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. The recent period was only good by 0.005 yuan, and April had no change.

A few days ago, Dafu Foreign Firm came to the market to ask, and 200 tons were negotiated. The price was adjusted by the owners to 14.5 yuan. The current trend has broken the lonely situation, and if the purchase appetite is flexible in the future, the market will not easily fall.

Yesterday, it is estimated that the oil mill traded 6 or 7 cars of Yingzhou beans, 3 cars of Bengbu beans, and this street Wenzhou, etc. purchased more than 1,000 bags of Hankou Zha beans, and more than 300 bags of Jiujiang Chi beans, and 500 or 600 bags of Du bean sand yellow.

<p>Chinese Tea Sales to the United States are Declining</p>
<p>--The American Stock Exchange Stops the Chinese Tea Auction--</p>
<p>Chinese tea's trade with the United States has a long history. In the past, black tea from Qimen and Ningzhou in the two lakes, and green tea from Wuyuan Pingshui, were transported to the Americas every year, no less than 150,000 or 160,000 boxes. Now it has been sharply reduced to 37,000 or 38,000 boxes. The reason for this is that the sales of tea from Ceylon, Japan, and Taiwan have expanded. Recently, the American Commodities Exchange market, because Chinese tea is not pure in quality and the standards are uncertain, decided to stop the auction, and the sales of Taiwanese tea are increasing, there is news of joining the auction. From now on, the reputation of Chinese tea in the United States will decline even more, and the future is worrying.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Relying On</h3>
<p>——(Chen Tianci)</p>
<p>"At home, rely on your parents; when you're away, rely on your friends." "Rely on the mountain to eat the mountain, rely on the water to eat the water."</p>
<p>These two sentences are common sayings circulating among our people, but upon careful thought, these words are fundamentally wrong. Why?</p>
<p>Because "At home, rely on your parents," if his parents die, who will he rely on? "When you're away, rely on your friends," if his friends don't promote him or pay attention to him, who else will he rely on?</p>
<p>"Rely on the mountain to eat the mountain, rely on the water to eat the water." That's even more incorrect. If he doesn't have a specific skill, what will he rely on to eat the mountain and eat the water?</p>
<p>The reason why our national character is so backward now is that these two idioms have had a considerable impact, leading to a sense of dependence and a lack of the ability to strive.</p>
<p>In short, if we want to survive in society and consolidate our position, we must strive, struggle, and create. We must learn a specific skill. Relying on this empty concept of "relying" is useless. Friends! Let us rise up. The bright future is right before us, waiting for us to develop it!</p>
<h3>Impressions of General Fu Zuoyi</h3>
<p>— Bai Xia</p>
<p>The bandit suppression army in Suiyuan is divided into several routes: the commander of the First Route Army is General Fu Zuoyi, whose mission is to protect the security of Sui Bei (North Suiyuan) and Sui Xi (West Suiyuan). At the same time, General Fu is also the overall commander of the bandit suppression army, and all the powers of resisting the enemy in Suiyuan are in his hands, making him arguably the most important figure on the Sui border.</p>
<p>When the author went to Suiyuan, I stayed in the only Suiyuan Hotel in Suiyuan. On the same day, I went to the liaison section of the provincial government to visit Section Chief Yang, asking him to introduce me to General Fu. Section Chief Yang said, "Chairman Fu has important official duties today and cannot receive guests. Leave your calling card here, and we will notify you tomorrow when the Chairman is free." Around four o'clock the next afternoon, I returned to the hotel from outside. The attendant said to me, "The director of the reception office of the provincial government just sent a car to pick you up to go to the provincial government, but you were not at the hotel." After listening to the phone, I immediately called the director of the reception office and asked him if Chairman Fu was still at the provincial government. The reply was, "He has already gone to the general headquarters. But the Chairman is hosting a banquet at the Suiyuan Hotel tonight, and you are also invited, so won't you be able to meet him tonight?" After hanging up the phone, I returned to my room and indeed found an invitation card on the table.</p>
<p>Representatives who came to the front line to offer condolences, and reporters who came to cover war zone news, would usually be invited by General Fu to a Western-style dinner. Those invited that night included overseas Chinese condolence representatives, the political minister of the reformed bandit army, Miss Li Fuying, the daughter of Li Fuying, the commander of the Third Route Army of the bandit suppression army, and the author, totaling about a dozen people. General Fu arrived at the dining room of the Suiyuan Hotel promptly at six o'clock. Being able to meet such a national hero admired by the whole country, needless to say, the author's heart was filled with joy. However, on this night, General Fu took off his military uniform and only wore a black cloth-faced leather robe, with a Parker fountain pen clipped to the upper lapel. He didn't look like a general at all, but more like a university professor.</p>
<p>General Fu's demeanor was very relaxed and amiable. The initial impression he gave was that of an extremely approachable elder. When he pointed to Miss Li and said to us, "The times are different now. Girls of seventeen or eighteen already know how to love their country and brave the wind and snow to go to Bailing Temple to offer condolences, fearing nothing. This is something we never expected. When I was this age, I would have been scared as soon as I heard the word 'war,' how could I have had such courage?" At this time, General Fu turned into a rural elder, filled with sincere and lovable feelings.</p>
<p>After this banquet, I had more opportunities to meet with General Fu. Especially on the day when Suiyuan held a major air defense conference, on the podium of the small drill ground, this amiable elder transformed into a heroic general. Not only did his gray military uniform make him appear brave and great, but also his loud voice, decisive words, and impassioned attitude all showed that he was an inviolable national hero!</p>
<h3>Quail Fights</h3>
<p>— Li Ping</p>
<p>The quail's shape resembles a hen chick, with short legs and a bald tail, grayish-brown in color with black spots. During the day, it hides in the grass and cannot fly high. Quail hunters use pigeons to catch them during the day, but at night, quails can fly high in the sky, so nets are used to catch them. However, there are very few males. Only a few out of a hundred are males. Male quails are good at fighting, often able to last for two hours during a match. Therefore, residents in the western Hunan area use this as the most common game and gambling activity.</p>
<p>When a male quail is caught, it is not kept in a cage, but is placed in a cloth bag with a round wooden piece as the base and hung on the head of the bed. When going out, it is tucked into the waistband. Newly caught quails cannot fight immediately because they are too fat. Therefore, they are only fed three times a day, with millet and other grains. After eating, they are given a bath with hot, strong tea. After washing, they are put back into the cloth bag after their feathers dry. After half a month of this, they become both healthy and thin, and this quail is qualified to go to the battlefield.</p>
<p>Before the fight, the quail owner discusses everything with the opponent. Then, quails of similar shape and strength are chosen and placed in the quail fighting arena - a low bamboo fence enclosure. They then advance, retreat, and circle, fighting non-stop. During the fight, they peck at each other or use their wings to strike. Good quails can fight for about a thousand pecks, lasting about two hours, before a winner is determined. It is said that quail experts can tell the quality of a quail at a glance. Good qualities include sharp pecks, strong wings, bright eyes, and a forehead as flat as a swallow. Once a quail loses, it cannot fight again unless it is exceptionally good, in which case it can only be nurtured and then fight again. Otherwise, it is thrown to the ground and killed, to be used as food.</p>
<h3>The Tomb of Lady Xi</h3>
<p>— Tao Kangjun</p>
<p>Indeed, this is a very powerful legend, deeply imprinted on the minds of every Nanjing resident. Therefore, we often hear a ballad-like saying: "Dig up Lady Xi's tomb, and you can make half of Nanjing rich," which is popular among every Nanjing resident. How tempting is that! Undoubtedly, it grabs people's thoughts and touches their heartstrings.</p>
<p>Indeed, according to the "Jinling Miscellaneous Records," Lady Xi, the empress of Emperor Wu of Liang, was buried east of Nanshan and next to Louhutou. Based on this record, we can know that Lady Xi's tomb is located near the ancient city walls.</p>
<p>There are no old trees or lush forests beside Louhutou, but there are mounds of desolate graves and withered grass everywhere. However, those who visit seeking the name of Lady Xi's tomb have no way to inquire, and those who are interested have no way to find it.</p>
<p>Several years ago, due to a prolonged drought, local farmers used the excuse of digging a pond to gather dozens of people, all with the hope of getting rich, and carried out their development work. However, after spending more than a month, they only obtained more than 90,000 ancient bricks with patterns, and nothing else, which made them feel greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>According to the elders, the construction of this tomb was extremely vast, and the glutinous rice juice used reached thousands of dan (a unit of weight). Even if the real tomb base is discovered, they would only sigh in vain, unable to do anything.</p>
<p>Recently, a Yuhua Gate has been added to the area to meet the needs of the Jing-Wu Road joint transportation. Therefore, the desolate atmosphere of the past has been embellished a lot. However, when we pass by there, the mysterious tomb of Lady Xi once again occupies our minds.</p>
<p>Japanese Correspondence</p>
<h3>Ambassador Xu's Return to China</h3>
<p>— Liu Lang</p>
<p>On March 6th of last year, Ambassador Xu Jingren came eastward from Shanghai by boat. On March 6th of this year, Mr. Xu happened to be taking leave to return to China to report on his work. In this short year, this amiable and kind old man of Shuangxi (Mr. Xu's alias) has truly spread his beautiful feelings among Chinese and foreign people here.</p>
<p>I still remember when Mr. Xu arrived in the East last year, it was right after the February 26th Incident in Japan, when the atmosphere was gloomy, rain and snow were flying, and the weather was so cold that everyone felt shivering. But this year, cherry blossoms are budding, and the spring warms the three islands, as if symbolizing that Mr. Xu's years of hard work have led China's dormant diplomacy into another stage full of spring.</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Xu's coming to the East was not his original wish, because he was deeply afraid that the barriers of language and writing would prevent him from exerting his skills to negotiate. In fact, the ambassadors of various countries stationed in Japan were also suffering from the same problem as Mr. Xu, and no one could directly engage in verbal battles with the "wooden-clog-wearing lads."</p>
<p>Mr. Xu always treats people with an open mind and a humble attitude, always acting as if he is inadequate. He can be said to be a person who has accumulated a lot of knowledge and has a long-term vision. He spares no effort in studying all issues related to Japan. All Japanese newspapers, magazines, and valuable writings are translated into Chinese by his assistants. Mr. Xu not only reads them once, but also adds detailed notes, leaving out not a single word, and does this every day, persisting for a long time. Therefore, Mr. Xu has only been in Japan for a year, but his knowledge of Japanese politics, economy, military affairs, national defense, and even customs and habits is thorough and subtle. Even Japanese experts who have lived in Japan for decades cannot compare to him.</p>
<p>There are no fewer than several thousand Chinese students studying in Japan who live in Tokyo. Hearing of Mr. Xu's amiability and kindness, they all think it is an honor to see him. Therefore, those seeking to see him come one after another every day, and Mr. Xu never refuses anyone, and encourages them with added effort. If someone has a special skill, he even humbly asks for advice. Therefore, young students, no matter whether their ideology is left or right, all unanimously love and respect him, and regard him as a "sage." For example, the student union, which was previously criticized as having a different background, had bare walls except for a few tables and chairs. There was no flag of the party or the country, nor a portrait of the Premier, but in the center of the wall was a large photograph of Mr. Xu, which is enough to show their respect for him.</p>
<p>After the news of Mr. Xu's return to China came out, various parties hosted farewell banquets for him, even as many as a dozen on the same day. Mr. Xu could not be in multiple places at the same time, so he often neglected one thing for another. It is said that a certain Japanese person specially arranged a grand banquet at a large restaurant, but fearing that Mr. Xu might not be able to attend, he drove a motorcycle to chase after Mr. Xu's car, going to various places. Finally, late at night, he kidnapped Mr. Xu, which can be said to be the most sincere friend among those who hosted banquets.</p>
<p>At 1:40 p.m. on the 6th, Mr. Xu departed from Tokyo Station. Tens of thousands of people came to see him off, and officials and carriages were like clouds. Representatives of Prime Minister Lin, Foreign Minister Sato, and Finance Minister Yuki, as well as former Foreign Ministers Yoshizawa Kenkichi and Arita Hachiro, former Ambassador to Germany Obata Kiichi, former Ambassador to China Ariyoshi Akira, Information Director Amau Eiji, and other famous people of the time, were too numerous to count. The enthusiasm of the situation was unprecedented. Among the assembly of talented people, there was a special guest who attracted the attention of the general public and must be recorded. The guest's face was haggard, his steps were unsteady, he wore a long robe, a mandarin jacket, flat-bottomed court shoes, and a melon-shaped hat, with a large red knot attached to the top of the hat. He frequently cupped his hands and greeted Mr. Xu. Those who did not know him would have thought that this man was a frustrated Chinese official who was searching for opportunities overseas. In fact, he was the "unadulterated Yamato race's" celebrity known as the "China expert" Goto Asataro.</p>
<p>As the scene of farewell at Tokyo Station came to an end, what followed was the grand occasion at the Yokohama port. Many Chinese residents and students in Tokyo rushed to Yokohama to see him off. After joining with the compatriots in Yokohama, the number of people increased and the momentum became stronger. The members of the Chinese Youth League of the Yokohama Chinese Chamber of Commerce were all dressed in uniforms, standing in line at the pier, paying tribute to Mr. Xu. After shouting "Long live" three times, they sang their party song, and everyone echoed it, resounding through the clouds. The most amusing thing was that some students from Guangdong province studying in Japan, distressed by the inability of the Cantonese language to fully express their feelings, raised their heads to the bow of the ship and shouted "Ma da i lai xie xi" (Please come again) non-stop. Mr. Xu also responded with "Domo arigato" (Thank you), which made the audience laugh. When the clock struck eight, the whistle sounded, and Mr. Xu set sail, breaking through the waves. Eight people accompanied Mr. Xu on his return, which was jokingly referred to as the "Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea."</p>
<h3>Reporter's Conversation</h3>
<p>— (Lao Yan)</p>
<p>About My Wife's Illness</p>
<p>A few days ago, I wrote in this column about Shen Bao reporter Mr. Huang Jiping's story of his respected father's anemia being cured by taking "human blood." Mr. Huang continued to talk to me about something else, and now I will also record it below:</p>
<p>Mr. Huang said: Three years ago, my wife suddenly suffered from hemoptysis. After being treated by famous Chinese and Western doctors, the bleeding stopped, but she still had a lot of phlegm and cough, and her lung qi was insufficient! A Western doctor advised her to take more "milky white cod liver oil" to increase lung qi and help build strength. Of course, we listened to the doctor's advice. The "milky white cod liver oil" we bought was also produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy. At first, we felt a little uncomfortable taking it, but we got used to it after taking it for a long time. We took it without stopping every meal for two years, counting at least thirty bottles. Sure enough, her qi and blood became very sufficient, and her body was the same as before, and even much healthier. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . "</p>
<p>(Author's note) Good medicine can cure people's diseases. Mr. Huang's respected father and wife both benefited from good medicine. In fact, many families in society have benefited from the excellent products of Wuzhou Pharmacy. Mr. Huang is just one of them.</p>
<h3>The Mated Mandarin Ducks</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven (Sentimental Words Feel the Compassion of a Loving Wife, Confessing Filial Piety to Sacrifice Autumn Light, Dark Green Eyebrows Touch the Scene to Write About Feelings)</p>
<p>He and Guoqi are like-minded. Today, he is wearing a blue mirror-faced flannel jacket, and his hair is combed black and shiny. He is wearing a Tolique glasses on his nose, which is a handsome and elegant figure. Guoqi blushed and said, "Why did you come in without a word?" Xiaosong smiled and said, "These poems are very well written. I think they have substance and are definitely not just empty words." Guoqi smiled and said, "You're doing something wrong." Xiaosong said, "You don't have to ask me whether this is right or wrong. I want to ask you, are these poems written and ready to be published in your novel manuscript? Or are you just writing them and not publishing them?" Guoqi said, "Of course I want to publish them." Xiaosong didn't ask further, but picked up the poems on the table again and recited them aloud, nodding and smiling: "At that time, I saw Liu Shanshan, and it was difficult to say a word when the phoenix trees fell. This gentleman is too lacking in courage. How can he not be able to talk after seeing each other for so long? He still stands quietly every day when he is busy, secretly looking at the green ring low, which is quite interesting. Why doesn't he use the word 'steal' for 'look from afar'? Is he still looking at it in an aboveboard way? In the last poem, it says to sit opposite the autumn flowers and cut a cold, which is simply your own experience." Saying that, he pointed to the chrysanthemums in the bottle on the table and smiled at Guoqi. Guoqi snatched the poems back, immediately put them in the drawer, closed the drawer, and smiled, "There is no third person here. Who are we bragging to?" Xiaosong sat down in the chair, tilted his head slightly, and still pondered, smiling: "This must have substance. I'll write a few with you, okay?" Guoqi sat diagonally opposite him, raised his head and looked at the sky outside the window, also with a slight smile. Xiaosong gently clapped his hands and said, "In my opinion, it must be your poem of ability. You..." Guoqi smiled and cupped his hands at him, and pointed a few times at the room of Zhang Laotai on the other side of the wall. Xiaosong lowered his voice and said, "According to my guess, you must be feeling quite difficult in this situation. Why don't you tell me the real situation? I can also think of some ideas for you. At the very least, I must make it possible for the two of you to talk. I think this lady must also be a poet. Yellow flowers are inserted in the beard, and one person walks in the setting sun in the west wind. Not to mention the person himself, even I feel lost in the artistic conception after reading this poem. What's more, you said that the thin eyebrows are damaged and the painting is not strong, and you can't see the rouge but tears." Guoqi was somewhat overwhelmed by his teasing, but he sighed softly. This sigh gave Xiaosong a hint, telling him that his guess was correct. Xiaosong was a nosy teenager, how could he let it go without asking? This matter is bound to reveal some news. (146)</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Worker Falls into the River</h3>
<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>The English translation of "dockworker" is "coolie". Literally, the sound and meaning are the same, even more appropriate than translating "Humor" as "幽默 (you mo)." However, the original intention of Westerners calling them "coolies" is not only because they are workers who "suffer" from "labor," but also to despise these brothers who shout "Hang Yo Hang Yo" all day long as inferior.</p>
<p>Originally, "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others" is also a clear teaching in China. Since they have become "coolies," they are only afraid that there is no place to "suffer" their "strength." They have no time to consider whether they are "inferior" or "excellent."</p>
<p>However, there are also "excellent elements" among the "coolies." Yesterday, this newspaper reported: "A worker from Jiangbei named He Fengrui at the Jinliyuan Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession suddenly fought with foreman Yang over a trivial matter. As a result, He was knocked into the river by Yang. By the time his companions rushed to salvage him, He had already disappeared with the waves. Yang, knowing that he had caused a major disaster, fled in the midst of the commotion..."</p>
<p>There is a point of doubt here. A worker died, and it was investigated clearly that his name was "He Fengrui," which is different from the historical reports of dozens of "coolies so-and-so" being injured (or killed). On the other hand, the foreman who knocked him into the river is simply referred to as "Yang so-and-so." If it weren't for the reporter deliberately making things mysterious, "Foreman Yang so-and-so" would be different from the general "ordinary coolie."</p>
<p>It also said "fought over a trivial matter." The so-called "trivial matter" was probably a "disagreement." However, no one witnessed it at the scene, so it is impossible to judge right and wrong. Judging from "knocked into the river" and "fled in the midst of the commotion," those "companions who rushed to" also distinguished "He Fengrui" from "Yang so-and-so." Although afterwards, "it was reported to the police station for investigation." What they will do is a matter for later.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I read a "reportage" about a yarn factory, in which the person called "Nama Wen" also stood tall in front of ordinary spinning girls in the posture of an "excellent element." From this, we can infer that even if you are the most "inferior" worker, if you can become a "foreman," you can also show off the prestige of being "excellent" in front of your peers.</p>
<p>However, don't ignore the reason why the foreign masters and compradores give special power to the "foremen." Let's copy a passage from "the lesson of the movie": "But when the white hero explores Africa, there are often black loyal servants who open the way for him, serve him, fight to the death for him, and die for him, so that the master can safely return home."</p>
<p>Now, who is the "excellent element?" Even if you become a "foreman" or "Nama Wen," at best, you are just "putting on a brave face to look imposing."</p>
<h3>Kite</h3>
<p>— Lu Ping</p>
<p>For a little thing, I was finally forced to run back to my hometown, so I saw kites again.</p>
<p>In my childhood, every spring, as long as it was close to the Qingming Festival, many children of similar ages would gather on the slopes of my hometown, carrying various kites and balls of thread to fly them here. Everyone competed enthusiastically, who's kite was beautiful, who's was big, who's was flying the highest. Competitiveness filled the little minds of every innocent child.</p>
<p>I remember that my competitiveness was much stronger in my childhood than it is now. If I was occasionally ridiculed by others, I would feel uncomfortable for several days, and even secretly hide in a place where no one was and cry bitterly. Therefore, my father often said to my mother:</p>
<p>"This child is too clever and too competitive, and can't bear any grievances..."</p>
<p>However, I myself am very clear about this temper. When people talk about me, I always like to hear a few words of praise. My father always bought me something better or more than what he bought for others. If other people's things were better or more than mine, I would think it was a great shame and humiliation. If I didn't stubbornly refuse it, I would be sullen for a long time without saying a word or smiling, until I forgot about it before I would return to normal.</p>
<p>Perhaps my heart is too narrow, but I am willing to be like this. Even now, I still have that stubborn and unique personality.</p>
<p>At that time, every year I would buy a few kites to fly. The eagle kites and butterfly kites that my father bought for me could not satisfy me. I always asked my mother to buy me a general kite to play with. However, when I found a kite larger than mine among my companions, I would feel that my own could not catch up with others. Therefore, I would pester my father or mother again, and often get a beating. But I was not discouraged, because my grandmother and my sister An were my best mediators.</p>
<p>Anjie was the most skilled at flying kites. She could fly a kite of any style and size into the sky, and fly it very high and steadily. When retrieving it, she was so quick and proper that broken lines or flying kites rarely happened. I myself could not fly kites. All the kites I bought were flown by a cousin and Anjie. However, when I saw my own kite flying in the sky and defeating my companions, I felt an unspeakable joy in my heart.</p>
<p>At one point, Anjie and I also thought about making our own kites. So we bought paper, cut bamboo strips, and made a paste. After a busy time, we finally made a butterfly kite that looked like nothing. But when we ran to the Fengshui mound with great enthusiasm to fly it, it always couldn't fly. It seemed as if a piece of iron was tied to the kite. It was thrown up and immediately fell down. This swept away all our joy. From then on, we also realized that our skills were not good.</p>
<p>When I was twelve years old, I was studying in a private school in Huzhou. One day, I suddenly heard a familiar sound in the sky. The sound was very loud, a bit like a pigeon bell. I looked up and saw a giant centipede wriggling in the sky. The graceful posture and neat fine feet made me see it very clearly. The clear sound was released by it. In the evening, the black shadow was lit with spots of light, vaguely floating in the sky, flickering and swaying, like the stars in the sky or the fishing lights on the sea.</p>
<p>Later, I learned that it was a centipede kite, the sound was the kite bell, and the light was the kite lamp. But when I asked my father to buy a similar centipede kite, he said it would cost dozens of dollars and refused to buy it. When I told my mother, she also said it was too expensive and therefore could not afford it.</p>
<p>Now my cousin and Anjie have passed away one after another, but I still haven't bought a centipede kite. Although my father is dead and my mother will no longer beat me, I myself feel that it is too expensive!</p>
<p>After several years of wandering and drifting in several places, the vicissitudes of life have eroded my childhood feelings. The competitiveness of the past has disappeared along with that precious youth on the journey of life. Although I always feel a little lost when I see kites floating in the sky every year, it is ultimately just a momentary thing.</p>
<h3>A True Picture of the "Special Zone"</h3>
<p>— Jin Ge</p>
<p>You all probably know that ×× has a special business zone, right? Let me tell you: get off the tram at ×× Gate and turn a corner, and you're there. The first thing you see is "×× Gold Shop". Don't be fooled, it's not a jewelry store, nor is it an old-fashioned gold shop that deals with money drafts. This is a special shop in the special business zone that sells special things. Don't believe me? Okay, look! What is written on that red, rectangular piece of paper on the wall by the door? It says: "This shop buys '× ash' at high prices." Still don't believe me? Go in and try saying, "I want to send money home." Won't they just curse you out? But on the other hand, you can buy so-called "opium" here. There are many shops like this, some are "yarn shops," some are "towel shops." In short, don't be fooled into buying what their signs say they sell.</p>
<p>The streets here are almost always wet. The garbage left behind by the vegetable vendors from the morning market isn't cleaned up by the street sweepers until 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon. When it rains, you really suspect you are stepping in a vat of soy sauce! Once, I walked down that street and saw a dead body lying on the side of the road. In the evening, when I walked past again, the dead body was still lying there, only now covered with a tattered straw mat.</p>
<p>Walking past these patients, the pungent smell wafts straight into your nose. If you have time to peek inside, you'll see someone squatting in the courtyard, tending to the stove. On the stove is a large pot, filled with a dark, gooey substance that seems to flow but doesn't. He's holding a large palm-leaf fan, fanning it vigorously. The red firelight illuminates the people outside the door. And the fragrance becomes more and more intense.</p>
<p>Further in are many small hand-rolled cigarette factories. These factories are so simple, you can hardly believe it. They just have a factory site the size and height of a square stool. The workshop is here, and the storefront is here. The manager, who is also the worker, the boss, and the salesperson, sits on a low stool. He makes cigarettes while also handling sales and serving customers. Business is very good, and he treats everyone the same, young and old, male and female. Most of his customers are rickshaw pullers or other laborers, who buy two cigarettes for one copper coin, and the price never goes up. As for certain people, a nod for one cigarette, a wink for another, one in the left hand, one in the right hand... Those managers, who are also the workers, the bosses, and the salespersons, never say a word. They know this is "income tax".</p>
<p>There are many small restaurants in the area, catering to those "hidden gentlemen," knowing that after their black rice, they'll want a bowl of white rice or a midnight snack. Business is very prosperous, especially at night.</p>
<p>There are also many second-hand shops in the area. There are not many used goods for sale inside the shop, but in front of the shop there are many glass-covered trays filled with cigarette holders, opium lamps, opium pipes, and other things I don't recognize, but all used for smoking. Many people go in and out of the shops, and you can often hear the sound of footsteps on the stairs. The shop assistants sit idly, yawning, while a large man with a bamboo pole wanders around the entrance in a leisurely manner.</p>
<p>One night, I walked down that street. Maybe I was a little thinner, or maybe it was a little colder, and I had my head tucked into the collar of my coat, with a few evening newspapers under my left shoulder. In the eyes of those "greeters," I looked like an "old gun." An "old gun" coming to the "special zone" obviously wants to "smoke two pipes". Sure enough, the "greeter" grabbed my coat sleeve and said, "Sir, do you want to smoke? ××'s opium is the best, and it's close by."</p>
<p>I turned around and glared at him, forcefully pulled my arm away, and hurried away. I knew he was cursing me, probably calling me things like "rube" and "rip-off".</p>
<p>Escaping the "special zone," my heart couldn't help but calm down. I looked up and saw a string of people, old and young, male and female, looking like crabs, all with "faces marked by opium" and "skinny as firewood"... cliches like that. The policeman in the lead was carrying several opium trays, opium pipes, opium lamps, and other smoking paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Looking at the location, it was right on ×× Road, just one step outside the "special zone."</p>

<p>A woman of tender heart and heroic spirit. Followed her gray-haired father into the hidden court. Pitiable, she was like a catkin in the wind, adrift in the rivers and lakes. But she encountered Mr. Fan, who made a forget-year friendship pact with her father. The families met without hesitation. They talked and laughed with great interest. Xiugu had a heart of pure respect and love. Most unforgettable was her dream of the Red Chamber in the hospital, which secretly consumed her soul. Recalling that her father was poor and sick and without direction. Fortunately, Mr. Fan's friend showed deep friendship and righteousness. Laughable that Xiugu, at first sight of Miss Fengxi, was confused her feelings. Chanting sutras and worshiping Buddha, she knocked on the wooden fish. Her heart was in turmoil, difficult to resolve. Countless entanglements, nowhere to describe. See her, bravely throwing herself into the General's Mansion, a shocking courage that soared into the sky. Bloodstained sword. Braving the snow in the Western Mountains, she did not refuse the labor. At the crossroads, infinite words of sadness. Only left a strand of black hair as a self-mockery. From then on, the world became strangers. Knowing that there was no such blessing to eliminate in the book of fate. Surpassing the Thirteenth Sister of that day. Abandoning the affections of children at once. A divine dragon cannot be summoned back from the sea.</p>

<h3>Automobile Smooth Braking Technique</h3>
<p>— Qi Ji</p>
<p>Smooth braking is easy to learn. The driver has only to imagine that he himself is part of the brake. No matter how ingenious the design of the brake may be. the ultimate result depends largely on how the driver uses the brake pedal. The procedure is to straighten the right leg and support the body on the back of the seat. Because this posture can produce a reaction force. Some people of ordinary strength can also use high-force pedals in an emergency. This is because the action of the leg is very similar to that of an elbow lever. We use some ordinary strength on the leg. which will turn into a large pressure on the brake pedal. If the driver's seat and the brake pedal are properly configured. any ordinary person can use a force of one hundred and fifty pounds by the above method. Whether this configuration is appropriate or not has the most important relationship in smooth management of the brake. Otherwise. if the pedal is too close or too far from the seat. it is difficult to coordinate the lever action of the leg. It is best that the leg is almost straight when the pedal is fully depressed.</p>
<p>After this important preliminary matter is done. the second step to be discussed is the method of using the pedal. Some people suddenly depress the pedal completely when something happens. This is a big mistake. Even in an emergency. this should not be done. Sudden braking. is to drag a wheel locked. and does not stop in the same way as gradual braking. At that time. the tire is slippery and does not rotate. and the sense of direction is lost. Even on a dry road. it is better to keep the car turning. If you lock the wheels on a slippery road. the result is always unthinkable. You must pay more attention on uneven roads. Because the wheels jump and lose adhesion. If the brake is properly installed. then a light touch on the pedal can push the brake shoes into contact with the rotating drum. Regarding this point. when anyone tries it according to the above method. they will feel the position where the shoes and the drum touch. The actions of moving the foot from the accelerator to the brake and then pushing the brake in depend on the situation at the time. and are not difficult. However. the driver must gradually apply force on the brake pedal. In other words. when pressing the shoes against the drum. force must be applied gradually. Do not immediately use full force to press the shoes down. Only after making this way of using the brake a habit. can unnecessary pressure be avoided in an emergency. And you can park safely on slippery roads. and avoid the danger of the wheels slipping without rotating.</p>
<p>Another important point is that the driver is familiar with the brake's responsiveness. On several properly configured brakes. doubling the pressure can produce double the deceleration. But some brake configurations are disproportionate. For example. an eighty-pound pressure on the pedal can produce a normal deceleration force. while a force of one hundred pounds can lock the rear wheels. The pressure on the pedal varies from car to car. so we must pay special attention when driving an unfamiliar car.</p>
<p>If there is excessive friction in the gears between the pedal and the brake shoes. the brake will be difficult to manage. Therefore. small parts such as the brake guide wheel pivot and the transverse shaft support should also be lubricated frequently. Sometimes. even though the driver is very careful. and gradually uses pedal pressure. the brake still suddenly clamps the wheels. The reason for this is that the drum is scratched. or the lining is damaged. or the screw on the axle is loose.</p>
<p>The left picture shows the array of new Packard cars sold to various circles in this port after the Maddie Motor Company's first exhibition of the 1937 Packard car last Saturday. According to reports, this is one of the largest deliveries of Packard cars since the Maddie Motor Company took over the management of Packard cars in 1924. The new car owners are said to be Mr. Jin of the China Merchants Bureau. Mr. Pan of Jardine Matheson. Mr. Rong of Shenxin Yarn Factory. Mr. Marius of the North China Daily News. Mr. Baling of Douglas Aircraft Company. Mr. Smith of Mei'an Company. etc.</p>
<h3>Safe Driving Teaching</h3>
<p>— (Y)</p>
<p>Whether the driver's skills are excellent or not is most related to the safety of the car. The Lane Technical High School in Chicago, USA, uses parts of the driving equipment of a discarded car, including the seat, steering wheel, brake, clutch, and levers, as desks for students to learn to drive. Each control lever has a wire connected to a gauge board in the area where the instructor stands. When students see the traffic conditions projected on the screen and move the driving equipment. all the disposal situations can be displayed on the lights. and the teacher can correct them at any time. After this initial teaching. students go to a driving range worth 35,000 gold dollars to practice. There are various types of runways. slopes. and turning angles to facilitate students' practice.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Front End of the New Ford V8 Car</h3>
<p>The majestic appearance of the front end of the 1937 Ford V8 car can be said to provide a completely new concept of streamlining among the economical and inexpensive car types. In addition to the new majestic appearance of the front end. there are also two important functional reforms. making it a further step in streamlining. The headlights. which were originally separated and attached to the car body. are now hidden in the mudguards. thus greatly improving the appearance of the front end of the car. The top of the hood is now a smooth-profiled top platform. hinged to the vent cap. and can be lifted from the front end. The two sides of the hood are also very easy to move if necessary.</p>
<p>The appearance of the front end of the Ford V8 is extremely majestic and pleasing to the eye. The front and rear bumpers both have practical protection. The backs of the mudguards are all raised. and in practice. they fully apply the "teardrop" shape. The front mudguards are next to the hood. and are flush with the high heat dissipation grille. which further enhances the majesty and power of the front end of the car. The heat dissipation grille. decorated with the V8 logo. is made of stacked metal bars. and has thicker central and vertical inlays on both sides to form its outline. The heat dissipation grille is shaped like an "A". and its end bends backwards and is deeply embedded under the hood top platform. The front side is obliquely inclined and straight down. The side windows of the hood are horizontal and have chrome metal edges.</p>
<p>The screens that can be opened on the proud car body are inclined and divided in the middle to form a "V" shape. which adds a lot of color to the streamlined appearance.</p>
<h3>1937 Lannuo New Cars Sell Well</h3>
<p>Since the 1937 Lannuo new cars were changed to be managed by Fada Motor Company on Xiafei Road. sales have suddenly increased. The products of this factory are excellent this year. and the price is low. which is quite popular with car lovers. Therefore. after the first and second batches of new cars arrived in Shanghai. they were soon sold out. and those who came to buy them later were disappointed. Recently. there have been daily inquiries from those who want to order from the company. According to a spokesperson for the company. the third batch of new cars will arrive in Shanghai in early April.</p>
<h3>1936 Annual Production and Sales Statistics of American Car Factories</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>—Total Sales of 4.6 Million Vehicles—</p>
<p>The United States is a leader in the automobile industry. Therefore. not only is the number of cars in the country greater than in any other country in the world. but also in the international market. American cars are also unparalleled. Due to the large sales volume. the state of the American automobile industry can also represent the state of the world automobile industry. Then. how many cars were produced by American car factories in the past year. 1936? This is certainly a question worth reporting. Here. let's record the total number of cars produced and sold by American factories in the past year.</p>
<p>According to recent statistics from the United States. based on the distribution of year-end dividends and the granting of bonuses. the total number of cars manufactured and even sold by various car factories in 1936 was 4,600,000 vehicles. This number can certainly represent the considerable development of the American automobile industry in 1936. In the eyes of car factories and car dealers. the fact that the production and sales of cars have returned to normal can prove that the results of the American national revival industry movement have been good.</p>
<p>When we look back. at the end of the previous year. when the new 1936 cars were launched. American car factories seemed to be stimulated by an accident. and the output immediately increased. As a result. in one year. the number of vehicles assembled and sold in the market was as high as 4,620,000. This number is indeed the highest record since the passing of the golden age of 1929 and the beginning of the recession. The total number of cars and trucks produced in 1929 was 5,600,000. making the American automobile industry in 1936 re-enter the bright path. In addition to the situation mentioned above. there are other factors. especially after the launch of the new 1937 cars. there were immediately surprising sales figures. Because the new cars were publicly exhibited in New York. people saw that there were several advantages that the new 1936 cars lacked. Therefore. all the car dealers at the end of the year. as soon as the new cars arrived. they could immediately sell them. The showrooms were often empty. without a display of new cars. That is to say. the difference between production and sales was also very small. very average. This situation can also make us think of the state of affairs in 1929. because by the end of the year. the number of unsold vehicles was not much.</p>
<p>In addition to dividends and bonuses. according to general estimates. the development of business in American car factories in the past year. such as buildings. the addition of machines. and extra payments to workers or shareholders. often totaled more than 200,000,000 yuan. The total value of the cars sold by all the car factories in 1936. together with the tires. was 3,000,000,000 yuan. It was only because of the shutdown of the Heipomo Beier factory and the reorganization was not yet completed that the car production was slightly affected. Otherwise. it would definitely be more than this number. In short. in any case. the American automobile industry in 1936 has entered the path of recovery. which no one will deny.</p>
<h3>Ford's Production Again Exceeds One Million Vehicles Last Year</h3>
<p>According to a recent announcement by the Ford Motor Company headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, USA. Ford Motor Company's total sales for the entire year of 1936 again exceeded the "one million vehicles" mark. This is the eleventh year in the past seventeen years.</p>
<p>It is said that according to the recently completed statistics. the world sales and world production in 1936 both greatly exceeded one million. The total number of Ford cars and trucks sold worldwide this year was 1,19,162. The total number of Ford vehicles produced worldwide during the same period was 1,194,800.</p>
<p>Ford's first "million car" year was 1920. In the same year. Ford's world production reached 1,074,336 vehicles. Subsequent "million car" years were 1921, 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1929, 1930, and 1935.</p>
