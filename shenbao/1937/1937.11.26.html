<h3>列山隨筆</h3>
<p>— 馮列山</p>
<p>英國的報紙與德國的報紙</p>
<p>美國聯合通訊社柏林分社社長洛克諾先生是駐德國記者中一位特出的人材。有一天德國“新聞記者聯合會”請他演說，題目是討論駐外記者採訪新聞的方法。當日聽講的人數頗多，而且一部分人還是國社黨中的重要人物。當他未演講以前，於私人閒談中曾告訴過記者，他不想把這一個機會錯過，打算說他所要說的幾句話。果然他的演說中就有這麼一段：“……我們作駐外記者的人，忙碌是我們的日常生活。不過我們此刻作駐德記者比起從前却又舒服得多。過去我們每日非閱讀一二十種報，對於當天的新聞便無法交代，目前呢，一天一份報紙就可以對付過去。這一來，我們倒省了不少時問………”他說到這里，聽衆都報以會意的微笑。自然，像這種公開的俏皮話也只有外國記者才敢說，倘若一位德國記者不識時務，對於他們宣傳部部長哥白爾司博士的傑作——使德國報紙淸一色化，也亂下一種批評，就算自尋煩惱的了。</p>
<p>半年前一位熟人看到記者的房間裏堆滿了英國報紙，便覺得有些奇怪。因為從前在德國的時候，房間總是收拾得十分乾凈的。我說：“這也是一件容易解釋的事情，德國的新聞來源旣然不在報紙上面，於是乎我們便把看報的時間省下來，做別的事情。例如多同德國人民接觸結果，也可以帮助我們明瞭德國的現狀。英國的情形就不同。英國人有不愛說話的脾氣，有的人以為這是他們深刻的地方，有的人却以為，恰因為他們根本沒有什麼話好說。總而言之，要在英國人口中打聽出一些消息，似乎要賣你一點氣力。然而天下事又是這麼凑巧，平常英國人所不願意說的話，天天都在英國報紙上登載出來。從最右派的晨郵報起，到最左派的每日工人報止，包羅萬象。只要我們每天熟讀英國報紙一二十種，綜合各方的論調，便不難猜破幾分個中內幕……在英國看報雖說是一件開心的事情，但同時究竟也有點“事出無奈”！……</p>
<p>照理，英國的記者是英國人，為什麼他們居然有這種例外？一方面固然由於英國新聞事業發達的結果，另一面，據說，還是因為一般英國記者善於喝酒的緣故。英國報紙上的文章幾乎都是他們酒杯下的產物。英國記者在英國人眼中，幾乎個個都有中國詩人李太白的風度。記得有一次在一宴會中只因為少喝了一點酒便引起幾位英國記者的奇怪。當時記者解釋：“這是要請大家原諒的，因為我并不是一位英國記者”！</p>
<p>到什麼時候日本人才說眞話</p>
<p>在蘆溝橋事變以前，一位某國的記者因為想打聽一些遠東的情形，特地跑去訪問了日本駐某國的武官一次。談話的中心問題，就是中日兩國在最近的將來會不會發生戰事。這位武官回答：“什麼？日本有作戰的凖備？日本人希望戰爭？根本就是一套謠言！我們是一向愛好和平的民族。戰爭不是最無意義的一回事？…”</p>
<p>這位記者當時覺得好笑，便問：“貴國得到了滿洲以後，打算用什麼方法來保守它？”</p>
<p>武官說：“用和平方法。遠東問題根本是一個經濟問題。日本素來不主張武力政策，只希望能夠生存。…戰爭有多少可怕！我們日本人從來就沒有想到這一點上面去！戰爭，‘不’！一千個‘不’…”</p>
<p>這位記者敘述到這里的時候，就問在座的人，到底要到什麼時候日本人才會說眞話？</p>
<p>以下就是另外一位記者講述他所遇到一段日本記者的故事。</p>
<p>據他說，兩年前他在倫敦認識了一位日本記者。他們間往來頗密，幾乎每星期大家總見面兩三次。當這位日本記者來看他的時候，一坐就是二三小時。這位日本記者不大愛好談話，大部分時間都坐在“沙發”椅上獨自一人看他的報紙并雜誌。不過，他承認這位日本記者是個好人，所以大家還是合得來。有一天，倫敦外國記者聯合會有一次宴會，他當時曾帶了一位認識的姑娘同去。在宴會中他便照例也把這位姑娘介紹給日本記者。幾分鐘以後，這位日本記者大約為的喝醉了酒，便當衆人面前對這位姑娘讚美起來，說她生得眞可愛。接着便向她要求她的住址并電話號碼。最後更約她一同吃飯去，說是他有一輛自備的汽車，終於弄得這位姑娘臉紅起來，連在座的人都覺得不好意思。</p>
<p>第二天早晨這位日本記者覺得出了事，便跑來向他的朋友道歉，說是因為喝醉了酒，所以鬧了一個笑話。“在平常”，這位日本記者說：“我心裏所想的事情不會說出來，至於我所說的都不是我所想的東西。昨天晚上只因為多喝了一點酒，於是乎不知不覺中流露了眞情一。這位日本記者的道歉方法，似乎并得不到對方的同情。歐洲人究竟是歐洲人，那位記者認為這位日本記者欺騙了他的友誼，原來過去就沒有對他說過眞話。</p>
<p>“所以，”他說：“喝了酒以後，最少連日本人也會說眞話的”。</p>
<p>中國人與日本人</p>
<p>在歐洲，我們時常總要被人家當做是日本人，歐洲人分辯中日兩國人的方法，十分簡便，就是衣服整齊一點的人是日本人，相反的就是中國人，這種便宜的方法，自然要使他們時常弄錯。經過我們說明以後，他們又老來一套道歉的口頭語：實在分別不淸，請勿見怪。自然，要一般歐洲人眞的辯別得出，誰是中國人，誰是日本人，到那時候大約連我們也懂得那一位是英格蘭人，那一位是蘇格蘭人的了。</p>
<p>中國人同日本人的分別到底在那里？有的人說，日本人生得比較短小。不過這個標凖在歐洲人看來也覺得困難，因為有許多海外的南中國人在身材上比起日本人來也不見得會高了多少。</p>
<p>根據一位熟人平時對於一般歐洲人的解釋。他提出了兩點：第一，日本人的皮屑顏色要比中國人黃些，日本的女人擦了粉，自然是個例外。其次，日本人因為不用椅子天天“盤坐”的結果腿部生得短而有些彎曲，當然大街上走路的時候，姿勢並不像中國人或歐洲人那麼自然。他這種說法，似乎對於歐洲人有了不少帮助。聽說，有人曾採用過他的辨別法，結果都有相當滿意的成續。</p>
<p>一位德國醫生有一次也將這個問題向一位日本醫生請敎。據這位日本醫生的答復，要分別出中日兩國人，倒也容易得很。他說：第一個特點，日本人普通都戴了眼鏡，中國人沒有。第二個特點，日本人大半身邊都帶有一架照相機，中國人沒有。至於第三個特點，日本人碰到人的時候，第一句話便問：厠所在什麼地方？…</p>
<p>這位是日本醫生的說法，試騐的結果成績如何，自然無從査考。不過我們相信，會有戴眼鏡的中國人，會有帶照相機的中國人，但逢人第一句話要問：厠所在什麼地方的中國人大約是不會有的。</p>
<p>假如這位日本醫生的觀察是正確的話，也許此後歐洲人碰到我們的時候，可以省去許多麻煩。</p>

<h3>比國京城盛會卽散歐美外交活動頻繁</h3>
<p>美國駐俄大使返國度聖誕　英樞密大臣訪德內容機密　捷克對英法談話表示滿意</p>
<p>［莫斯科］美國駐俄大使台維斯今日宣稱、彼卽擬返國一行、預定明年一月間返任、此行除歸國與家人團叙、慶祝耶穌聖誕外、別無其他作用、外傳彼將繼平漢爲駐英大使之說、亦屬不確云（廿五日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於美國代表台維斯將於本週杪來英一行之說、雖尚未經此間官方加以證實、但政界人士相信、美代表將以私人資格來英、期圖對英樞密大臣哈立法克斯與希特勒之談話真相、有所得悉歸而報告於羅斯總統、美駐英大使平漢現因病留美、（廿五日海通電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］關於樞密大臣哈立法克斯勳爵柏林之行、首相張伯倫頃在下議院宣稱、勳爵此行、純係私人性質、但曾在事前約定於本月十九日前往貝許特斯伽、登鎭、謁見德國元首希特勒、至哈立法克斯勳爵與德國當局談話所獲結果、則因雙方業已約定保守秘密之故、迄今尚未通告法國政府云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］英國首相張伯倫在下院中關於樞密大臣哈立法克斯之演說、此間政界人士頗表歡迎、蓋首相曾稱、英國各報對此行之評論頗有錯誤之處也、據稱、哈立法克斯與希特勒之會談、僅爲交換意見性質、雙方均持保留態度、故絶無具體結果之足云、德國政策已見希特勒演詞中、决無變更云、（二十五日海通電）</p>

<p>［巴黎］國務總理旭丹外交部長台爾博斯定於本月二十八日晚間前往倫敦、並於廿十九三十兩日、與英國當局進行談話一事、頃由各報加以評論、其中右派巴黎廻聲報載稱、“此項外交談話、或成爲歐戰後最關重要之談話、亦未可必迄至目下為止、英法兩國皆能團結一致、以臨德國、即以中歐洲問題而論、英法兩國卽不擬放棄集體安全原則、法國自最近十六年以來凡與某某國所簽訂之互助協定、更不擬予以放棄、似此值民地問題、或當在英法兩國當局之談話中佔重要部份”、急進社會黨事業報載稱“英國政府即當徵求法國政府同意、俾决定英德兩國談話、能否賡續進行對於德國有所讓步、德國元首希特勒聞曾函達義國首相墨索里尼余與英國樞密大臣哈立法克斯勛爵所進行之談話、未能完全滿意、即英法兩國之同盟關係、亦覺其强固而密切、德國决不撤回義國而有所舉動、英法美三國或有一日在經濟上壓迫我兩貴、吾人究當如何予以應付、已在考慮之中”社會黨人民報載稱、德國所提出之建議、“若如各報所載則非法國所能接受此項建議、若係英國樞密大臣哈立法克斯勛爵與德國元首希特勒進行談話所獲之結果、則哈立法克斯勛爵、此行可謂完全失敗、英國政府亦惟有承認之”云（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］素以外相艾登喉舌見稱之“約克厦郵報”頃載稱“法國總理旭當、外長台爾博斯日內來英之後、與英國政界要人商談之問題、不僅爲英國樞密大臣哈立法克斯聘問德國之結果、且當討論西班牙遠東及地中海方面之局勢、其或將南菲洲問題、一併加以討論、亦未可知、此外倘有餘暇、並當討論英美兩國商約談判之問題、則以英美商約談判、與英美法三國在經濟上之共同行動、實有密切關係也、又法國總理旭當與外長台爾博斯、定於二十九日上午、率同法國外部政務司長瑪西格里、行抵此間、當立即與英國政治家開始交換意見、二十九日正午、由張伯倫首相設宴、爲法國總理外長洗塵、午後復行繼續談話、晚間則由外相艾登在其邸第設宴招待、三十日午刻、由外務部宴請午後或晚間、法國總理及外長、即當啟程返國云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］此間政界人士雖一致相信、因首相張伯倫發表演說及法國政治家行將來聘英倫之故、外交情勢已顯見進步、但此間報紙認爲、當此時期仍不宜過於樂觀、因所討論之問題、牽涉甚大、性質複雜、初不能保證一定可以得到解決辦法也、泰晤士報稱、英法談話、乃英國政策之自然結果、蓋英國政策常欲對他國之觀點、加以認識、此種英國政策、决不致認爲有中傷德意軸心之意向、若有此種蓄意之企圖、實爲至愚策與必失敗之事、現在一切困難惟有由信任與善意中獲得解决、德國平等權利之要求、倫敦方面、至爲認識、並將為談判之目標云、（二十五日海通電）</p>
<p>⊙捷克京城　關於法國國務總理旭丹外交部長台爾博斯前往倫敦事、此間一般人均表示滿意、以爲此乃英法兩國密切合作之又一表示、殊有裨於歐洲和平、至英國曼哲斯德保衛報日昨所載消息、謂德國曾提出要求、主張捷克依照瑞士國先例而组成聯邦政府一層、則屬不可思議、似難予以置信、要之、德國苟能在捷克內政外交上爲之保障獨立、捷克自願與之成立諒解云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>僞警佈崗</p>
<p>浦東由日方所招募之僞警、約百餘名、現已佈崗、僞驚局設於警局路前浦東警察分局内、因浦東地面遼闊、不敷分配、現尚在繼續招募中、聞名額須募足五百名、但應募者人數不多、該項僞警胸前佩黃色符號一條、手執一籐鞭分隊在途梭巡、每隊僞警一名、雜一日軍、爛泥渡·其昌棧·楊家渡·等處·均有僞警巡查、</p>
<p>禁搬物件</p>

<h3>再談民食問題</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>目前各米行售米、限制人各一元。當因存糧無多。意在應普遍之需要。得分配之平均。然而事實所限。恐不能完全如其預期之目的。故鑒於購米之擁擠狀况。以及老弱婦穉之艱於購得。現在所行購買辦法。似尚有改善之必要。略舉數點以供獻於米業諸君。㊀卽係限制人各一元。力求普遍。務使人人不以購米而浪費時間。挨受苦痛。故不特應推廣糶米地點。亦應放寬糶賣時間。㊁無秩序的購買。徒使强有力者得食。而老弱婦徲甚至延頸企佇。終日不易購得勺米斗糧。故各糶米塲所。除派巡捕維持秩序外。並應以竹木爲欄。先到者先購。順次購買。出入有序。庶人人得有購買均等之機會。㊂限制購糧。固求普遍。但以上海人口繁多、五六升米。常不敷人家一宿之糧。（飯食店除外）。於是為求應其食用起見。使用多人。紛往購買。於是買者愈衆。雖鞭撻驅逐。亦不能免紛亂攘奪之狀矣。故應體察存糧之多寡。卽使一時不能寬放至人各一石。或五斗亦應將一元之數擴充至兩元三元。使家無饔餮之虞。而秩序方可保持。㊃上海之民食問題。係整個的。應由各方面會同米業。作整個之規畫無以一隅一業之事視之也。</p>

<p>卸貨已竣</p>
<p>法商達孚洋行向西貢訂購之米、總計十一萬五千包、分四批運滬、每包重量二百二十磅合一石二斗半、歸公共租界工部局及華南米業公司調節滬市民、食之用、第一批二萬五千包、裝英商太古公司嘉應輪抵滬後、昨已卸竣、均係碼頭交貨、第二批三萬包、裝英商怡和公司富陞輪抵滬後、昨已卸貨、當晚完竣、均暫存棧房、改棧房交貨、</p>
<p>完全復業</p>
<p>米號業公會會員米號公共租界鄧仁泰等三百家、法租界萬昌等二百家、向工部局領得洋米、辦理零糶後、業已完全復業、雖規定購米者以一元為限、但甚為擁擠、家家如此、昨日起暫行停業之飯店及粥店、均已相繼復業、各包飯作亦繼續代客包飯、少數居民改吃麫食、因此粉價飛漲、標準粉昨批發行市每包漲至四元三角、零沽行市每包四元五角以上、</p>
<p>三批抵滬</p>
<p>第三批三萬包、由德輪載滬、於昨晨十時抵滬、停泊法租界金利源碼頭、該輪由德商美最時洋行代理、昨日下午一時卽開始卸貨、由米號業公會備卡車派給各米號辦理零糶、上項洋米係碼頭交貨、第四批聞報裝英商太古公司浙江輪運滬、約二十八日晚抵滬其數目亦為三萬包、</p>
<p>繳款領米</p>
<p>米號業公會辦理會員米號領米零糶、計公共租界及法租界總共五百家、昨晨起卽開始繳款、㊀地點、四川路二七六號中國銀行㊁辦法、碼頭交貨每包十六元一角五分、棧房交貨每包十六元四角五分、另加外費暫以每包二角五分計算、至於零糶辦法、每人仍以一元為限、每市斤八分五厘、分派辦法、每批每家均為四十包、</p>
<p>麵粉運津</p>
<p>新聲社記者眸向糧食界探悉、滬市各棧房所存小麥、為數頗多、總約八十萬包、由福新阜壹兩麵粉廠趕製麵粉、目前滬市存粉總約三十萬包、又昨日記者在租界外灘、目睹鉅額麵粉、裝英商太古公司順天輪運津、總約二千包、聞係該埠華商戰前之定貨、由廠商分期解貨、</p>
<p>民食無虞</p>
<p>至於滬市糧食、自交通梗阻後、全賴洋米及麵粉維持、幸經公共租界工部局及華南米業公司、合作採辦洋米、業已分批抵滬、同時外商洋行亦紛向國外訂購洋米、行將源源而來、所以滬市糧食决無缺乏之虞、目前住民向各米店購米之擁擠情形、不久卽可恢復原狀、</p>
<p>零糶情形</p>
<p>公共租界各零售米店、自前日下午、由米號業公會將送到第一批西貢米後、卽於昨日下午一時許、開始零糶、仍舊每人限購一元、並由各捕房在每一米店門口、派遣巡捕多名彈壓、無如人數衆多、米糧頃刻售罄、後至者及婦孺老弱、均無力擠軋而空返、徒呼奈何、惟有幾處則由巡捕先令依次挨候、魚貫而購、雖在後者未能購得、然秩序則頗良好也、</p>
<p>聞市西聯益會、以連日洋米分批到滬、已由各米號開始零糶應市、惟以數量過少、人口衆多、以致各米號門前擁擠不堪、秩序紊亂、雖經中西巡捕盡力彈壓、究因勢如潮湧、難加遏止、且年強力壯者、固能排擠而前、其他如老弱婦孺之流、多鵠候終日、而未得顆粒、且因被擠氣悶倒地、踐踏受傷者、亦屢見不鮮、或有發生生命危險、該會鑒於此種情形、認為零糶辦法、未臻完善、决非根本之策、昨已向租界當局、及民食負責各團體呼籲、速籌更安全穩妥計劃、改善零糶、以免意外、</p>
<p>再濟難民</p>
<p>國際救濟會、前日准法公董局通知、撥發洋米八百包、為救濟法租界內各團體所辦收容所難民食糧、業已分配完竣、該會昨復接法公董局函知、續派洋米八百包、分配界內各收容所、以資救濟、當由該會通知各收容所、携带印鑑、前往該會取棧單、</p>
<p>南市存米</p>
<p>本市雜糧業同業公會、前為調劑本市民食、採辦米糧二萬石、起卸於南市堆棧、正擬運入租界、供給零糶、適值我軍退出南市、交通斷絕、無法運出、近因界內米食頗感缺乏、米業無米零糶、乃由雜糧業公會報告工部局、由工部局向日方軍事當局接洽、證明南市該項米糧、確係調劑界內民食所用、要求發給通行證、運出應市、業已由工部局派員前往、與日軍當局磋商、惟日方對運輸問題、須加考慮、故未得要領、該項米糧二萬餘石、迄今尚存南市、無法運出云、</p>

<p>街頭難民</p>
<p>現棲居於本埠之難民、據記者調查所悉、現由慈善團體聯合救災會收容者四萬餘人、慈聯救濟分會收容者約五萬人、現一部份尚投靠在親友家中、但在勢已難久持、且目前露宿兩租界街頭里衖者、估計亦不下萬餘人、故難民設無法遺送、將會見增加、現街頭流浪難民八一特市聯救濟會及慈聯會等各方、均正設法收容、蓋此舉實為人道所必需、同時亦裨益公衆治安、市聯救濟會現正尋覓相當場所、擬先收容在公共租界內之流浪難民、</p>

<h3>日郵船淺間丸仍擱港口</h3>

<h3>浦東同鄕會收容被難同鄕詳紀</h3>
<p>溯自滬戰爆發之初、浦東各處、尚屬安全、是以旅滬之戰區同鄕、皆丙田園可居、相率返里、浦東同鄕會、乃有遣送同鄕之舉、迨至十月初旬、沿浦居民、或因家室被燬、或因衣食難繼、漸有求援該會收容者、暫以中醫診療所爲收容所、並隨時分送至市救濟會各收容所、其辦理情形、業經報告、十月之杪滬戰形勢轉變、同鄕之被難者日衆經第六十四次理監事會决議擴大收容組織、並着手辦理收容所、茲將該會二旬來辦理情形、分別誌之如下、</p>
<p>辦理收容</p>
<p>該會先後成立收容所六處、依次由高志昂·黃贊庭·於琨·潘鴻岐·凌永年·陳景虞·為管理員、共收容難民三千四百二十四人、然仍不敷安揷、隨時商請市救濟會、請予收容、負担給養、計送往市救濟會收容所八處、及交通大學國際收容所收容者、共二千四百四十三人、當十一月七日以前、該會祗有第一第二（南京路）第三各收容所、早已額滿、而來會登記之同鄕、幾如潮湧、市救濟會又未能盡量安揷、致都擁塞杜廳、管理為難、待至難民區劃成後、乃得逐批分送、其送往難民區浦東同鄕之分佈情形、計新北門雜糧公會、二八二人、城隍廟樂意樓、二四三人、城隍廟內園、四一五人、城隍廟黃酒公所、一五零人、城隍廟星宿殿、一零四人、城隍廟映水樓、一五零人、城隍廟香雪堂、一六零人、城隍廟萃秀堂、六五零人、城隍廟大新照相館、七五人、珠玉業公會、一零六人、城隍廟裹園、二五零人、城隍廟鐵業公所、一五零人、總計二千七百三十五人、難民區各收容所、現因該會無法管理、移交於國難救濟會、惟同鄕會曾將大批糧食、送交國際救濟會代為分發、現救濟會食糧充足、無需補助、惟衣被方面、頗感缺乏、</p>
<p>在十一月七日之前、由浦東童子軍登記收容之難民、據名冊所載、約有二千五百餘人、其給養方面、除由當地人士捐助外、均由同鄕會補助、在六日深夜、因國軍調防誤會、即於七日清晨、紛紛來滬、除年壯男子、逕自投會外其餘則分送各處、其分送情形、該隊正在編送報告中、</p>
<p>計劃生産</p>
<p>浦東同鄕會對於難民之從事生產、决定先從女工着手因上海花邊及刺繡商行、尚有多量工作可做、今已將主辦之各所調查完竣、計有刺繡技能者二七人、網花技能者十一人、紗布技能者四九人、捲菸技能者一六人、織絨繩技能者四人、今已將有刺繡技能之上一人、送往孫湘記工場錄用、再浦東陸家嘴綸昌紗廠、復工在即、該廠派員通知同鄕會、業經分函全市各收客所、知照該廠工人前往登記、至全市各收容所中同鄕之工作技能、亦已開始調查、以便分配工作、現本市各工廠、若香烟紡織等廠、先後復工、會中已派員前往接洽、請予錄用、</p>
<p>衛生設施</p>
<p>浦東同鄕會除在中醫診療所、闢有病院外、並特約生生醫院為難民產科醫院、現已收孕婦五十餘人、本會西醫診療所各醫士、復逐日輪流至各收容所診治給藥、對於各收容所之衛生設備、亦復加以檢查、惟西醫診療所無病院之設備、中醫診療所額位又少、應設法擴充、</p>
<p>教育方針</p>
<p>難民之教育問題、因環境關係、未能依照原定計劃進行、不得不變更方針、由管理股職員常駐本會各收容所、辦理保甲編制、使難民之自治組織、稍具雛形、而今後之敎育方針、亦當以潛移默化為出發點、</p>
<p>給養報告</p>
<p>浦東同鄕會主辦之各收容所、辦理之初、由會撥發給養、及至編入市救濟會收容所後、由各管理員直接向市救濟會領取、將來另行詳細報告、至外界捐贈之糧食、計光餅九七○隻、大餅二五○八○隻、麵粉一○包、白米一石、奶糕四四包、包子五四○二隻、麵包六九五隻、青菜一○○斤、醬乳腐一二○塊、大頭菜一○○斤、</p>
<p>再衣被方面、由陳子馨捐助被絮一千條、潘志文經募棉馬夾九百件、張伯初經募三百件、地方協會移贈一萬件、已取五千件、他若外界捐贈之衣服、計二千六百六十六件、廠布三十一疋、除棉馬夾正在陸續分發外、各界捐贈之衣被、巳予分派應用、</p>
<h3>來源未暢燃料撙節使用</h3>
<p>僅賴鴻基煤等接濟價格一時尚難回跌</p>
<p>本市燃料以來源未暢、煤炭·煤球·等燃料售價、仍呈漲勢、現值冬令、天氣巳寒、往昔市民、在此時均已裝置煤爐、燃燒取暖、晝夜不熄、故消耗量至為鉅大、今則日常烹煮所需、已感十分困難、莫不竭力撙節、除市房設備較完全者、有水汀外、其裝置煤爐取暖者、已不多睹、據煤炭界人士稱、目下市民之燃燒量、殆不及往常之半數、又據稱、目前燃料來源、僅靠鴻基白煤屑及開凜煤之接濟、但為數僅各每月約二萬噸左右、至柴炭雖經柴炭業公會盡力設法疏通、惟短時期內、尚難望到貨、而浦東各棧儲煤、亦未能多量取出、故燃枓價格、照目前情形視察、一時仍難望回跌、</p>
<h3>昨晨鉅量膠菜到滬</h3>
<p>由順天輪裝來　不日卽可應市</p>
<p>最近蔬菜市價、以浦東白菜·及菠菜·金花菜·等、源源來滬、本已回跌、但前咋兩日起、忽又發生障礙、以致售價又略見上漲、茲悉昨晨太古公司順天輪到滬時、裝來鉅量山東膠菜、卽可應市、同時浦東菜、亦經育關係當局交涉疏通、卽日仍可繼續來滬、故售價當卽回跌、</p>
<h3>郵政總局招領浦東郵件</h3>
<p>特設專處　等候具領</p>
<p>郵政總局、頃為浦東各處已撤去之郵局信件、及儲金匯兌、招人收領起見、在四川路總局三樓、特設專處、供一般民衆具領、</p>
<h3>交通銀行否認公債被刦</h3>
<p>報載消息係屬不確</p>
<p>前日報載交通銀行裝運救國公債兩箱、計一萬萬元、由滬運通、在吳淞口外、為日軍攔阻搜查、當將救國公債兩箱刦去等語、茲據交通銀行發言人聲稱、該行最近並無救國公債運出、報載各節、完全不確、</p>
<h3>許藻春應診</h3>
<p>傷外專家、許爾康子藻春、向居南市及在虹口分診、現該處淪為戰區、避難在特區、設診所於愛多亞路南京大戲院西首維爾蒙路樹德里八號、並聞許醫士以值此非常時期、對於難民之前往應診者、一本救濟茲懷、報酬不計、且許醫士手術高明、妙手成春、誠滬地避難病家之福音、</p>
<h3>陳筱寶父子應診</h3>
<p>名醫女科、陳筱寶偕子、盤根大年、向住城內三牌樓、茲為便利求醫起見、移居法租界巨籟達路六百十六號四明邨口、照常應診、</p>
<h3>來函</h3>
<p>逕啟者、頃見貴報登戰時事社通訊、內有“據本市湖社方面消息、湖州方面我大軍雲集、且地勢險要、敵難進攻、改用海軍陸戰隊轉向太湖西南岸進迫、圖在夾浦登岸、截斷京杭國道、北入宜興、南侵長興、而攻吳興之背、”等語、查本社並無得到是項消息、不知時事社何所根據、猶恐傳聞失實、除函該社查詢外、為特函請貴報迅予更正、以免誤會、不勝企禧、此致申報館、湖社執行委員會敬啟、十一月二十五日、</p>

<h3>滬甬滬通兩綫繼續開航無阻</h3>
<p>滬港間航綫乘客極擁擠　世界班輪紛紛籌備復航</p>
<p>滬甬滬通兩航綫、最近因戰事關係、曾發生阻碍、但滬通綫爲弓下上海與內地問唯一交通綫、郵件貨運、難民輸送、均賴該綫各輪維持、而滬甬綫亦以滬上各種鹹貨、向由寗波供給、在此蔬菜缺乏之時、需要更殷、且旅滬寗紹兩帮人士爲數甚衆、凡有商業等一切往來、胥賴該航綫轉遞、故寗波同鄕會徇同鄕請求、特派烏崖琴、李耀庭、爲代表赴甬向當局陳明要求復航理由、業已蒙批准、但於必要時仍得命令停航、烏李兩代表、已於昨晨乘德平輪返滬報吿、華義公司對於滬甬綫、現决照常開駛、德平輪於昨晨抵滬後、於下午三時仍由滬開甬、乘客頗多、至滬通航綫、雖以南通以上之交通發生阻碍、但經各方竭力設法疏通後、刻已恢復、華義公司之恩德輪、凖於今晨八時駛通、太古及怡和兩公司行駛該航綫各輪、亦均照常往來、以利交通、至於港滬綫與世界班輪除一部復航外、其餘亦紛紛籌備復駛滬綫、茲將各情分誌如下、</p>
<p>滬通綫改不定期輪</p>
<p>行駛滬通航綫外輪爲蕪湖、武穴·同和·平和·恩德·等五艘英商太古公司輪船、原爲定期班輪、今已改爲不定期班輪、其通吿如下。“本公司開通州班輪船現在、暫時停止、一俟公佈時日、方可出售、特此通吿、”至於英商怡和公司同和輪、定今日駛通、義商華義公司恩德輪、俟返滬後卽駛通、</p>
<p>滬台綫改今日開航</p>
<p>英商神福輪船開航上海定海台州綫、由台記營業公司經理、羅已先行售票、原定昨日駛台、臨時因途中、天氣關係、須今晨始能返滬、昨特通吿改今日下午三時由滬開航、</p>
<p>滬港乘客異常擁擠</p>
<p>滬港問航綫、現雖暢通無阻、但往來輪隻减少、故乘客擁擠異常、茲澽旅行社方面消息、今日駛港之德輪、哥達生號、其滄位又被定一空、故後室者咸無法購得、而不得不將行期展援、並悉各外商航運公司、現爲便利行旅計、已簿議議派船隻行駛、俾每星期有船隻二艘以上來往滬港間、</p>
<p>中外貿易漸見活躍</p>
<p>戰事西移後、各國世界班輪紛紛籌備復航滬埠、浦東藍烟囪太古公司、已於本月二十日、有第一艘（Tlengarry）號到滬載貨、其淸曾載前報、現悉該公司第二艘Sarpadon號本定前日（二十四）日抵滬、因沿途貨物擁擠、改於今日（二十六日）方始進口、至第三艘Deucalin號、本室二十六日到滬、所載貨物僅三十七頃、茲因香港另有大宗進貨二千七百噸報裝該輪運滬、故亦改期下月二日、方能進口、觀此情形、中外貿易、漸見活躍矣、</p>

<h3>Important Speech by Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>China Determined to Maintain the Policy of Resistance to the End, Hoping to Obtain Assistance Within the League of Nations Framework; First Requirement for Discussing Peace is Japanese Awareness</p>
<p>[Nanjing] When Chairman Chiang met with foreign journalists tonight, he stated, "We firmly believe that justice will ultimately triumph over might, and we will resist to the end, down to the last inch of land and the last man. This is our fixed policy." Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, entered the reception room with an air of confidence and determination, showing no sign of defeat or dejection. Chairman Chiang continued, "China intends to maintain its policy of determined resistance. We will defend Nanjing, but from a distance. The lives and property of foreigners will be protected. Rumors that Nanjing will be put to the torch if it is in danger of falling into enemy hands are just that: rumors." Regarding the possibility of a ceasefire, Chairman Chiang said that this was up to the Japanese side. Later, Chairman Chiang mentioned a box recently dropped by Japanese planes containing a letter. He said that the letter was unsigned and expressed a desire for an early ceasefire, stating that Japan did not want to impose harsh conditions but only sought China's cooperation in anti-communism. Such claims are contrary to the facts. When asked how peace talks could begin, Chairman Chiang said that it was not yet the time to discuss this. First, Japan must become aware [of the situation]. When asked whether he hoped for Soviet assistance, Chairman Chiang replied that he hoped for assistance as stipulated within the framework of the League of Nations. When the reporter further inquired whether China could hope for assistance from other sources, given that the Nine-Power Conference had not helped China, Chairman Chiang replied that he was confident that the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty would assist China. Without such assistance, all treaties would be rendered invalid, and actions that violate treaties would be rewarded. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>International Committee Proposes Establishing Nanjing Safety Zone</h3>
<p>Boundaries Have Been Drawn; No Military Institutions to Be Established Within the Zone; Requesting Understanding and Cooperation from Chinese and Japanese Authorities in Protecting Refugees</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The official news regarding the Nanjing Safety Zone is as follows: The International Committee, composed of Danish, German, British, and American residents, has recently suggested to the Chinese and Japanese authorities the establishment of a Safety Zone to provide refuge for civilians in Nanjing and its vicinity during hostilities. The Committee will undertake to seek guarantees from the Chinese and Japanese authorities that no military institutions (including transportation) will be established within the Safety Zone, that no troops will be stationed there (except for police carrying pistols), and that no soldiers or officers will pass through. The Committee will inspect the Safety Zone and monitor the implementation of the aforementioned guarantees. The Committee proposes the following boundaries for the Safety Zone, which are deemed appropriate for the care of refugees. This zone is located within the western section of Nanjing, which Japanese planes have carefully respected during bombings. The boundaries of the zone are proposed as follows: The eastern boundary will be North Zhongshan Road, starting from Xin Jie Kou and ending at Shanxi Road; the northern boundary will be the line from Shanxi Road to Xikang Road; the western boundary will be Xikang Road to Hankou Road, then turning into Shanghai Road to the intersection of Hanzhong Road; the southern boundary will be Hanzhong Road, starting from the intersection of Shanghai Road and ending at the original starting point of Xin Jie Kou. These boundaries will be marked with white flags. The Safety Zone will take effect from the date the Committee notifies both authorities that their understanding has been reached and the preparations have been completed. The Committee hopes that the Japanese authorities, for humanitarian reasons, will respect the civilian nature of the Safety Zone. In order to complete the necessary negotiations with the Chinese authorities in the shortest possible time and to make full preparations for the resettlement of refugees, the Committee urges the Japanese authorities to respond promptly to this proposal and earnestly hopes that this request will receive satisfactory consideration. The above proposal was submitted to the Japanese authorities in Shanghai via the U.S. Embassy radio station on Monday night. The Chairman of the International Committee is Mr. Rabe, representative of the German firm Siemens. If the Safety Zone can be realized, the Committee is prepared to organize an office to handle the protection of refugees, estimated to number between 150,000 and 200,000. From a military point of view, the above location is the only acceptable one. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>Opinions in Japanese Newspapers</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Nichi-Nichi Shimbun stated today that if a Safety Zone is established in Nanjing, it will greatly hinder the Japanese army's attack on Nanjing. There are fewer than 50 foreigners in Nanjing, and the proposed Safety Zone is adjacent to batteries and military installations. It is impossible for the Japanese army to attack Nanjing without affecting the Safety Zone. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the Nanjing Safety Zone is completely different from the Shanghai Nanshi Refugee Zone, and this matter must be decided by the Japanese military authorities attacking Nanjing.

<h3>Unsettling Situation in Kinmen</h3>
<p>Prices Soaring, Food Scarcity; Chinese Language to Be Abolished, Japanese Schools to Be Established; Residents of the County Fleeing Overseas</p>
<p>Xiamen Telegram: After the islands of Jinmen, Dadou, and Lieyu were occupied by the Japanese army, Jinmen County still has the two small islands of Dadeng and Xiaodeng under our control. The Jinmen County government was moved to Dadeng. Now, County Magistrate Kuang Han has been dismissed, detained, and investigated. The provincial government has appointed Zhou Bingyi to succeed him. Zhou arrived in Dadeng on the 15th to take office. In the past, there were no regular troops stationed in Jinmen County, only a small number of county security police and one team of guards. Now, a team from a certain division has been dispatched to Dadeng for deployment, which is very strict. The security team has been transferred to Xiaoti for training. The Jinmen Pseudo-Local Public Security Maintenance Association is currently managed by Wang Tingzhi, former chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Xu Xingeng, Zhou Yong'an, Zhou Yongyuan, Chen Taiyi, and others, with Wang as the head. A local patrol team of twenty pseudo-police and a water patrol team of twenty fishing boats have been established to maintain public order. Later, Shi Tingzhi convened a meeting of the village chiefs, but only a few attended. Jinmen Island was divided into five zones each in the front and rear, and all have begun operations. Major Komura of the Japanese Marine Corps convened a meeting of the village chiefs at Houpu on the 11th, requiring the village chiefs to each provide two strong men to form a patrol team. He also declared on the spot that the Chinese language would be abolished and Japanese schools would be established in the short term. All boys and girls aged six to eight must attend school. In Jinmen, forced labor is used for construction projects without pay. Two thousand piculs of salt stored in the Jinmen Salt Bureau are distributed as compensation.</p>
<p>Jinmen is an island, and has no production. Everything relies on external supply. Even rice is insufficient and relies on external assistance. After the fall, traffic with Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou was blocked, and the source of supply was cut off. Prices soared, especially for rice and daily necessities. Rice rose from one dollar and twenty cents to one dollar and seventy or eighty cents per dou (old scale of fifteen and a half catties). The Japanese army announced that it would suppress prices and said that it would transport goods from Taiwan for assistance. However, only 3,000 bags of rice (three dou and two sheng per bag) were transported on the 10th. Since then, no other goods have been transported. Daily necessities are still surprisingly expensive and are becoming more expensive. It is often several times the original price and there is nowhere to buy them. Therefore, the people of Jinmen are constantly complaining.</p>
<p>From Jinmen, those who fled to Xiamen and Tongan numbered ten thousands and thousands, but the number has decreased greatly recently, only dozens of people a day. Generally, those who were able to raise money or had relatives to rely on have fled. There are still more than 30,000 people left, mostly farmers, workers, and fishermen. As for the refugees who fled to Xiamen and Tongan, 3,000 to 4,000 have gone to Nanyang in the past two weeks. The rest have relied on relatives in Xiamen and Tongan or have set up their own homes. As of recently, among the refugees who have been received and registered, there are still 3,300 in Xiamen and 547 in Tongan waiting to be settled. Plans are being made to move them to other counties for relief. However, among these, only more than 130 are so poor that they need the relief society to provide daily meals. Overseas Chinese from Jinmen in Nanyang have raised more than 30,000 yuan to help refugees from their hometown. There are millions of overseas Chinese in Nanyang, and most of them are from southern Fujian. Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen in southern Fujian are the hometowns of overseas Chinese. Therefore, since August, many people from southern Fujian have fled to Nanyang to avoid the war. In May, only dozens or hundreds of people returned to the country on each ship from Nanyang, at most twelve people. Now, each ship often carries 400 to 500 people, at most 700 people. In October, only 1,413 people returned from Nanyang, while 6,217 people went to Nanyang. After the Jinmen incident, more people have been going overseas in November. Up to now, each ship has more than 600 people, even those passing through Xiamen have more than 400. There are still more than 3,500 people waiting for ships in Xiamen, although Fujian has restricted the departure of strong men, the number has not decreased, and the price of tickets has soared. The price of third-class tickets to British-controlled areas, which was originally limited to 76 yuan, has risen to 140 to 150 yuan, with the most expensive reaching 170 to 180 yuan. Old passengers also pay 50 to 60 yuan. (November 19)</p>
<h3>Sharp Decrease in Trade at Xiamen Customs</h3>
<p>Import and Export Taxes Decrease from 500,000 to 130,000</p>
<p>Xiamen Telegram: The average monthly customs revenue of Xiamen Customs in recent years has been more than 500,000 yuan. From January to July of this year, this average was maintained. After the full-scale Anti-Japanese War broke out, imports decreased sharply. In August, it was still more than 320,000 yuan, but in September it decreased sharply to more than 132,000 yuan. In October, a ten-cargo transit tax was levied. According to the customs announcement, the import and export tax revenue in October was 130,280 yuan and 95 cents, a decrease of more than 1,000 yuan compared to September. The import tax was 104,745 yuan and 42 cents, the export tax was 8,217 yuan and 51 cents, and the rest was additional taxes. The transit tax totaled 91,193 yuan and 67 cents. Therefore, the total tax revenue in October was 221,575 yuan and 62 cents. Xiamen is the largest import-surplus port in the country, and for nearly 70 years, it has been an import surplus. The largest import surplus was in 1930, with more than 29 million customs taels of imports and more than 4 million taels of exports, resulting in an import surplus of 25 million taels. Since then, trade has gradually declined, but in recent years, it has still maintained an annual import of 30 million yuan and an export of 4 million yuan, resulting in an import surplus of 26 million yuan. Therefore, although tax revenue has decreased sharply in the past two months, the actual decrease in imports is that the outflow of cash has decreased by 2 to 3 million yuan per month.

<h3>Water Level in Yichang Continues to Fall, Navigation Becomes Increasingly Difficult</h3>
<p>Sunken Ship Discovered in Dongting Lake; Reduced Water Depth in Tianjin</p>
<p>The report of Shanghai shipping to Tianjin with increased shallow water surcharge etc. has already been published. A reporter from Datong News Agency now explores the conditions of reduced water depth in Tianjin and various places along the Yangtze River as follows.</p>
<p>Current Situation of Shallow Water in Tianjin</p>
<p>According to inquiries with the Tianjin Maritime Customs Service, the water volume of Tianjin Port was still 14 feet last month. However, ships longer than 300 feet have been banned from entering the port. Now, as the winter shallow water season has arrived, the water depth has been further reduced. Ships must use barges for loading and unloading. The increased shallow water surcharge by foreign shipping companies is a common practice in winter.</p>
<p>Drastic Drop in Middle Reaches of Yangtze River</p>
<p>The water volume of the Yangtze River has also decreased sharply recently, especially in the middle reaches. According to the report received by the Maritime Customs Service yesterday, the water level in Yichang has fallen to within 10 feet. The water level scale is only 9 feet and 8 inches, so navigation upstream from Hankou is quite difficult. In the lower reaches below Hankou, the water level has fallen more slowly and has not had any impact.</p>
<p>Sunken Ship Discovered in Dongting Lake</p>
<p>At the same time, in the section from Yuezhou to Changsha in the middle reaches, the Maritime Customs Service reported that a sunken civilian ship was discovered in Dongting Lake. Its location is near the No. 20 patrol ship in Dongting Lake, in a due west direction, and one chain away. It is hoped that various ships traveling in this section of the waterway will pay attention to avoiding it to prevent accidents.</p>

<h3>Our Wuxing Front Lines Shifted Backward; Fierce Fighting in Jiangyin and Wuxi</h3>
<p>Zhoujingxiang Defense Line Has Been Saved; Our Reinforcements Advance from Changxing; Stalemate on Shanghai-Hangzhou Line in Xiashi</p>
<p>Due to clear weather yesterday, the front-line fighting became fiercer. The focus remained on the south bank of Taihu Lake and the left and right wings of the Jinpu Railway front lines. Our military defense in Jiangyin and Wuxi lines are unusually strong. On the railway front line, we still hold the Zhoujingxiang position east of Wuxi. Although it was fiercely attacked by the Japanese army yesterday and was once in a critical situation, it has been saved after reinforcements arrived. The artillery battle at Jiangyin Fortress was extremely fierce. After our army abandoned the Fushan Fort, a large number of Japanese warships concentrated on the river surface there, intensively bombarding the fortress, attempting to destroy our blockade line. Our army, defending the fortress, also returned fire. Our army's positions along the riverbank remained unmoved. Extremely fierce battles broke out in the suburbs of Wuxing (Huzhou) on the south bank of Taihu Lake yesterday. The main intention of the Japanese army was to capture Wuxing and then go straight to Changxing, threatening the rear of Wuxi and Jiangyin, and cutting off the Jinpu Railway and blocking the highway. The Japanese Marine Corps in Pingwang and Nanxun attacked our Jiapu Town in Changxing via the Taihu Lake waterway the day before. After a fierce attack by our army, many Japanese motorboats were hit by our artillery fire and sank into Taihu Lake. However, the Japanese army continued to send reinforcements, and the two sides were still fighting fiercely in Jiapu. Our army in Wuxing met the Japanese army advancing along the highway in the suburbs and fought fiercely. Our army bravely resisted without retreating. Both sides suffered heavy losses, but due to the fierce artillery fire of the Japanese army, the suburban position was once invaded. At the same time, due to the attack of the Japanese Marine Corps in Jiapu Town in the rear, our army retreated slightly from Wuxing. Although the county seat was breached, our army still held the near suburbs of the western city and fought a bloody battle with the Japanese army. Our reinforcements have advanced from Changxing to assist in a counterattack towards Wuxing. Our military positions from the town of Xiashi on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road to the sea monitoring station of Zhapu have not changed. Yesterday, Japanese planes were very active due to the clear weather.</p>
<h3>Our Army Firmly Defends Jiangyin Fortress</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to reliable sources, the line from Jiangyin Fortress to Wuxi is still firmly defended by the Chinese army. The rumor that the Japanese army has broken through this line is unreliable. It is said that many Japanese planes continuously bombed this line on a large scale on the 24th and bombed Jiangyin and Wuxi five or six times, but the Chinese army's positions remained unmoved. (Express News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>The fighting in Jiangyin has been extremely fierce in recent days. The Japanese have launched a full-scale invasion with their naval, land, and air forces. Their naval fleet has entered straight into the sea from Fushan Port, with no less than sixty or seventy ships, concentrating their firepower to bombard Duanshan, east of Jiangyin, and firing on the Changyinsha coast. That sand is isolated in the river, shaped like an island. Our military has prepared long ago with deep trenches and high fortresses. The Jiangyin blockade line is also unusually strong. Japanese planes have bombed extensively for days, but our works have not been heavily damaged. A portion of the Japanese troops launched from Changshu to attack the front of Jiangyin. Our military has used the mountains to its advantage and defended the position relying on the rugged terrain. It can be fought for a long time.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Position is Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>Wuxi is one of the important strongholds on our left wing and is extremely important. Our defense line there is gradually stabilizing. Zhoujingxiang, east of Wuxi Station, was once broken through by the Japanese army, but has now been recovered by our reinforcements' brave attack. Moreover, our elite troops have arrived one after another, strengthening the position and advancing towards the Xicheng Highway. The Japanese mechanized troops were originally operating extensively in the highway area east of Wuxi, but since Zhoujingxiang was recovered by us, the Japanese army has been cautious and dare not rush around.</p>
<p>[Hankou] According to reliable Chinese sources, the Chinese army is currently preparing to resolutely resist on the banks of Taihu Lake. Large armies are currently gathering on both the north and south banks of Taihu Lake. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to Chinese sources, the Chinese army near Wuxing on the south bank of Taihu Lake has received a large number of reinforcements and has launched a fierce counterattack towards Wuxing, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. The Japanese army, which landed on the west bank of Taihu Lake in an attempt to invade Yixing, has retreated after being bravely resisted by the Chinese army. On the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, both sides are still engaged in fierce fighting near Xiashi. (Express News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>Kwangsi Provincial Authorities Welcome Ma Xiangbo</h3>
<p>Wu Zhongxin Also Arrives in Guilin Yesterday</p>
<p>Guilin: National Government Committee Member, the 98-year-old Ma Xiangbo, arrived in Quanzhou yesterday from Hengyang. This morning at 9:00 AM, he took a car from Quanzhou to Guilin.

<h3>Fierce Battle Unfolds Near Tongxiang</h3>
<p>After occupying Jiaxing, the Japanese army advanced on multiple routes. Its main force not only attacked Wuxing along the Jiahu Highway but also advanced along the canal embankment, attempting to break through our line at Chongde and Shimen. Although our troops at Puyuan retreated slightly, they are currently holding their ground near Tongxiang, engaging in fierce battles. Shuanglin, in the Huzhou area, remains in our hands. On the Shanghai-Zhuji Road front, the Japanese army still does not dare to advance lightly. The outposts of the two armies are currently located between Xiaoshi and Wangdian railway stations. Regarding the battles along the Hangzhou Bay seawall on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, although there are rumors of Pinghu's fall, they have not been verified. Japanese warships in Hangzhou Bay have continuously shelled the Zhapu Fortress and Haiyan city, but our positions remain firm. The highway between Zhapu and Haiyan is also under our control, maintaining close contact with Xiaoshi and Tongxiang.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Japanese Troops Head to the Front Lines</h3>
<p>A Japanese aircraft carrier carrying more than eighty seaplanes, which sailed from Japan to Shanghai, entered the Wusong Port at around 7:00 AM yesterday and berthed in front of the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu. Some of the planes from the carrier took off yesterday to participate in the battle and bombing at the front. At around 5:00 PM, the planes returned to Yangshupu in groups. Yesterday, seven Japanese transport ships, including the Taiyuan Maru No. 3, Meiko Maru, Miyu Maru, Banko Maru, and Hamaue Maru, arrived in Shanghai one after another before 9:00 AM and berthed at Osaka Wharf, Beizhan, Huazhan, and Huangpu Wharf. They also transported 1,500 reinforcements, along with a large quantity of bombs, ammunition, food, and medical supplies, which are currently being unloaded. At around 10:00 AM, four transport ships refitted from Japanese merchant ships, fully loaded with approximately 7,000 to 8,000 reinforcements, sailed out of Shanghai, passing through the blockade line in the Nanshi area via the Huangpu River, heading towards Songjiang, apparently joining the front lines of the Shanghai-Jiaxing Road operation.</p>
<p>At around 4:00 PM yesterday, three Japanese planes flew very low over the Caowan ferry in western Shanghai. Within the Suzhou Creek in western Shanghai, Japanese steamships and towed civilian boats were busily transporting military supplies.</p>

<h3>Amidst World Peace and National Disappointment, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference Announces Adjournment</h3>
<p>Passing a Declaration Confirming Various International Principles - Our Representative Issues a Statement Recognizing it as an Annex to the Declaration - US, British, and French Representatives State They Remain Attentive to the Sino-Japanese War</p>
<p>Brussels: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference last night, amidst an atmosphere of disappointment, passed a report and declaration, advocating that China and Japan should cease hostile actions and adopt peaceful methods to seek a solution. It then adjourned indefinitely. Italy was the only country that still opposed it. Although Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, tried his best before the meeting to have the conference adopt amendments with active action, he ultimately felt it was futile. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference has only temporarily adjourned, but there is unlikely to be a prospect of reopening. The Italian representative, Macardi, said that this report has a hostile theory, so he expressed his opposition and said, "This meeting has failed, I said it long ago, and now it has indeed happened. We should disband it, not adjourn it." US Chief Representative Davis stated that, in terms of a fuller understanding of the difficulties and possibilities of the situation, the outcome of this meeting was gainful and without loss. "Today's adjournment does not mean that the difficult problems we have discussed will be put aside, nor does it mean that our attention to resolving the Far Eastern conflict will be lessened. Instead, it will make our continued active efforts to end hostilities and establish a constructive solution even more important." British representative Cranborne spoke, agreeing with Davis's argument, saying that the British government will have extremely close contact with other governments during the adjournment period in order to utilize any opportunity to achieve the purpose of convening this meeting. "We are not unaware of the situation that the Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, has clearly and realistically stated to this conference, but I believe that the Chinese delegation will be able to understand the difficulties encountered by this conference," he said.

<p>Brussels: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference passed its second declaration at 5:20 PM today and decided to postpone the meeting indefinitely. Representatives of the relevant countries had previously met twice for very short periods of time. At that time, Chinese Chief Representative Gu Weijun had not yet received instructions from his government. Most of the other countries' representatives wanted to postpone the meeting as soon as possible, so they strongly urged Mr. Gu to accept the declaration. Mr. Gu finally expressed his agreement in the name of the Chinese government, and the postponement was decided.</p>
<p>The French representative, the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Tedeschi, said, "As the US representative said, this meeting is difficult to declare postponed, but the governments of the participating countries should still consult each other in order to find the most effective procedures to restore peace in the Far East. We have deep sympathy for the tragedies that China has encountered and hope that it will get out of this situation in a short period of time. France is happy to participate in any steps that can lead to a solution to the current dispute."</p>
<p>New Zealand representative Jordan and Conference Chairman Spaak spoke successively, all saying that the compromise spirit of the Chinese delegation was particularly commendable. Chinese representative Gu Weijun immediately replied that the declaration should be copied and sent to the member states of the League of Nations. Spaak then delivered a speech and announced the indefinite postponement of the meeting. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>General Assembly Issues Declaration</h3>
<p>Brussels: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference has just passed a document today called the "Report of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference." The report is divided into two parts, about sixty pages in length. The first part summarizes the progress of the conference and reiterates the main principles and resolutions previously passed. The second part is the declaration, which is divided into twelve paragraphs, with the main points as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Among the various international treaties, the Nine-Power Treaty is extremely important, containing several principles and limitations used to define the mutual relations between the signatory countries. In accordance with these principles and limitations, all signatory countries solemnly promised to respect the sovereignty of other countries, not to surpass other countries politically or economically, and not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.</p>
<p>(2) This treaty has already formed a mechanism that can be used to maintain international peace and security without the use of force. The mutual relations between nations must be based on this mechanism in order to achieve trust and mutual benefit in commerce and finance.</p>
<p>(3) If countries violate the above-mentioned principles, then the entire international organization based on current treaty obligations will inevitably be destroyed, and countries will have no choice but to expand their armaments in order to seek security. As a result, there will inevitably be a general feeling of unease among nations. In particular, these principles are the foundation of civilizational progress, which no one can deny, and their effectiveness cannot be destroyed by force. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>(4) The Nine-Power Treaty Conference, as stated in the invitations from various governments, was convened in accordance with the above-mentioned principles. Its purpose is to discuss the situation in the Far East in accordance with Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty and to seek a solution to the regrettable current dispute in a friendly manner.</p>
<p>(5) Since the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on the 3rd of this month, it has made continuous efforts to promote mediation work and has tried to invite the Japanese government to cooperate in order to stop the war and reach an agreement.</p>
<p>(6) The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is convinced that no international dispute can achieve a fair and lasting solution through the use of force. Regarding the dispute between China and Japan, the countries concerned have proposed mediation to both parties in order to quickly stop the war and establish a general and lasting solution. The conference still believes that it is in the interests of both parties to accept this proposal. As for direct negotiations between the two parties, it is difficult to establish a satisfactory solution. On the contrary, only after mutual consultation with the major countries concerned can a fair and lasting agreement be established and accepted by both parties.</p>
<p>(7) The principles contained in the Nine-Power Treaty are basic principles that must be respected in order to maintain world peace and promote an orderly national and international life. This level should be reaffirmed.</p>
<p>(8) The Nine-Power Treaty Conference believes that if the war between China and Japan can be stopped quickly, it will not only be in the real interests of those countries, but also beneficial to all countries in the world. On the contrary, if the war continues for one day, the difficulty of resolving the dispute will increase.</p>
<p>(9) Therefore, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference earnestly suggests to both parties to stop the war and switch to peaceful procedures.</p>
<p>(10) The Nine-Power Treaty Conference also believes that all peaceful and fair solutions should not be ignored or omitted.</p>
<p>(11) The Nine-Power Treaty Conference adheres to the above-mentioned principles. However, in order for the governments of the participating countries to have sufficient time to exchange opinions and continue to seek peaceful solutions, it believes that temporarily adjourning the meeting is a wise move. In particular, the participating countries or the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, or those who have special interests in the Far East, or are directly affected by the current situation and developments there, should still pay attention to the current dispute. Among them, the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, in accordance with the terms contained in the treaty, especially Articles 1 and 7, have clearly accepted a policy of stabilizing the situation in the Far East, and are currently still under this obligation.</p>
<p>(12) After the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is postponed, the chairman or two member states may convene the meeting again if they believe that continuing the meeting is beneficial. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Our Representative's Statement</h3>
<p>Brussels: After the Nine-Power Treaty Conference passed the declaration today, Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Gu Weijun immediately read a statement accepting the declaration. The statement said that several points in the original text of the declaration have been revised or rectified, which the Chinese delegation will record. The revised draft of the declaration and the original text can both reaffirm some general principles that China has always accepted, which is a matter of course. However, in terms of the development of the Far Eastern dispute, the Chinese delegation believes that simply reaffirming these principles is not enough to cope with the serious situation, and it cannot regard the results obtained by the conference as satisfactory. In addition, the Chinese delegation had previously put forward various suggestions, especially the suggestions put forward on the 22nd of this month, hoping that the conference could take some positive and concrete measures to assist China. The conference failed to consider it, and the Chinese delegation deeply regretted it, and deeply believed that concerted action by the countries concerned was necessary to deal with Japanese aggression and restore peace in the Far East. Although it has been decided to postpone the meeting indefinitely, it is temporary in nature, so that the governments of the countries concerned can exchange opinions and, in accordance with the principles contained in the Nine-Power Treaty and the goals of the county, continue to seek all peaceful means to resolve the dispute between China and Japan. The Chinese delegation will also record this, but in order to make this new effort easier to succeed, the Chinese delegation deeply believes that the countries concerned must quickly take concerted action to actively assist China, and at the same time impose various restrictions on the aggressor country. In order to express the spirit of solidarity and unity, the Chinese delegation hereby accepts this declaration and requests the conference to record this statement and use it as an attachment to the declaration.

<h3>Chairman Expresses Emotion</h3>
<p>Brussels: After the Nine-Power Treaty Conference resolved to postpone the meeting indefinitely, Chairman Spaak, the Belgian Foreign Minister, delivered a speech, saying, "Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun told us that he felt disappointed when he left the meeting. Most of the representatives of the participating countries also felt the same way, because we failed to complete the task we undertook, which was to restore peace in the Far East in a peaceful manner, so we cannot help but feel disappointed. However, we are not discouraged by this. Looking at the speeches made by US Chief Representative Davis and French Representative Tedeschi a while ago, it is enough to prove that no one has given up their efforts, and hundreds of millions of people around the world have also agreed to reaffirm and decided to adhere to certain important principles, such as the love of peace and respect for treaties. In my personal opinion, I have always believed that these principles will win the final victory." (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Brussels: The content of the report of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has been slightly revised. Australian representative Bruce proposed that the government's declaration should be included in the report. Our representative Gu Weijun requested that, in order to show impartiality, the Chinese government's declaration of November 6 should also be included. It was then decided that the name of the report would be "Report of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on November 24." Before returning to their posts, representatives Gu Weijun, Guo Taiqi, Qian Tai, and others will visit representatives of various countries separately tomorrow to discuss the future of the conference. Gu Weijun and Chen Gongbo will go to Paris tomorrow, Guo Taiqi will return to London on the evening of the 25th, and Hu Shize will return to Geneva on the morning of the 25th. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Brussels: The Chinese representative Gu Weijun and his party are preparing to pack their luggage today and return to their post in Paris. The representatives of various countries admire Ambassador Gu for fighting for justice without being humble or arrogant, and shake hands with him to pay their respects. (National Telegraph on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] People from all walks of life in China here are quite disappointed to hear that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has adjourned without any results. The Chinese government did not have much hope for this conference, but at this time there is a rumor that the United Kingdom and the United States have failed to reach a consensus on the issue of cooperation in the Far East, which is particularly disappointing. Public opinion generally believes that external assistance is impossible, and China can only gather all its strength to cope with a protracted war. At the same time, the wartime government is gradually taking shape, and only important personnel are left in various government agencies to handle important official matters.

<h3>Difficult Situation in the Shanghai Concession</h3>
<p>British and American Governments Assist the Municipal Council in Negotiations - Japanese Demands for Negotiations Have Not Yet Yielded Results</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons met yesterday, and many members questioned Foreign Secretary Eden about the recent situation in the Shanghai International Settlement. The Foreign Secretary replied, "It is a definite and unpleasant fact that the International Settlement is in a very difficult situation today." The Foreign Secretary said that he had heard that the Japanese authorities were discussing with the Municipal Council authorities matters such as curbing anti-Japanese activities in the Settlement and disbanding Chinese government agencies. This discussion is still in progress, and the results cannot be said yet. British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and the British authorities in Shanghai have repeatedly reported to the Japanese government, which has promised to respect the rights of foreigners in China and will continue to do so for as long as the situation requires. Conservative Party member Morley asked whether the British government intends to do its best to help the Shanghai Municipal Council resist the Japanese demands. The Foreign Secretary replied, "Yes, the government has already helped." Communist Party member Gallacher then asked, "Does the Foreign Secretary's previous answer mean that Japan is now continuing to break its promises?" The Foreign Secretary replied that Gallacher could draw any conclusions he liked. Labour Party member Fletcher asked whether the International Settlement was land belonging to the Chinese government and the governments concerned, or whether it was ceded, or whether it was only under international administration in fact. The Foreign Secretary replied that this question was completely different from the written question. Labour Party member Wedgwood then spoke, saying that the matter was quite urgent because the Japanese authorities were now forcibly preventing the British from entering their own properties in and around Shanghai. He also asked whether the Foreign Secretary would inform the House in detail of the above situation this Friday. The Foreign Secretary replied that he was willing to answer any written questions raised by the members at any time. The Foreign Secretary then answered Morley's question, saying that on November 1, the Japanese authorities replied to the joint note submitted by the Consuls-General of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Germany in Shanghai, allowing nationals to freely enter the parts of the Settlement occupied by the Japanese army to inspect their own properties and promising to eliminate various restrictions as soon as possible. However, according to recent news, British merchants in Shanghai have not yet regained the freedom to enter their warehouses and other properties in Hongkou and Yangshupu. It is heard that the Japanese military authorities have stated that the two districts are not yet safe, so the British government has negotiated with the Japanese government on this matter and will continue to do so. Labour Party member Noel-Baker asked, "Do we know that the Japanese army occupied Shanghai without us making any protests?" The Foreign Secretary replied, "Mr. Noel-Baker does not know this. When the war broke out, the Japanese army was on the same footing as the troops of other countries in the Settlement. As far as he knew, the Japanese army did not pass through the Settlement south of the Suzhou Creek." The Foreign Secretary concluded by saying, "The International Settlement is not only in the interests of the United Kingdom, and the International Settlement is in a very difficult situation today, which is a definite and unpleasant fact." (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] British Ambassador to Japan Craigie spoke with Foreign Minister Hirota for half an hour today. It is heard that it was related to the situation in Shanghai, but the details are unknown. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Various Countries Supply China with Arms</h3>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Says the Method is Proper, But it is Not Necessary to Announce it</p>
<p>[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden said in the House of Commons today that the methods of supplying China with arms by various countries will not be announced. Liberal Party member Mond asked whether it was appropriate for the member states of the League of Nations to supply China with arms at this time in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on October 6. Eden replied, "Of course it is appropriate." (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Inquires About North China Customs Duties</h3>
<p>Temporarily Stored in Yokohama Specie Bank</p>
<p>[London] Labour Party member Henderson asked in the House of Commons today whether the Japanese authorities are still retaining the customs duties of North China. To what extent are the funds collected by the Japanese authorities used to pay foreign debt obligations? Foreign Secretary Eden replied that, as far as he knew, the customs duties collected in Tianjin and Qinhuangdao were deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank in the name of the Inspector General of Customs. Although there were payments, they were not on time and were insufficient. Although Eden mentioned the Japanese seizure of customs patrol boats for military use, the government had issued instructions to the ambassador to Japan because of this matter. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden answered a question from Labour Party member McEntee in the House of Commons today, saying that as far as he knew, the Japanese side had not requested the issuance of Manchurian reclamation loans in the United Kingdom, and he had no knowledge of the attitude of other countries on this matter.

<h3>Random Notes from Lieshan</h3>
<p>— Feng Lieshan</p>
<p>British Newspapers and German Newspapers</p>
<p>Mr. Lockner, the Berlin bureau chief of the Associated Press of America, is a prominent figure among the reporters stationed in Germany. One day, the German "Journalists' Association" invited him to give a speech on the topic of how foreign correspondents gather news. A large number of people attended that day, and some of them were important figures in the National Socialist Party. Before he gave his speech, he told reporters in private that he did not want to miss this opportunity and planned to say a few words he wanted to say. Sure enough, there was such a passage in his speech: "...We, as foreign correspondents, are busy in our daily lives. However, we are much more comfortable now as reporters in Germany than before. In the past, we had to read one or two dozen newspapers every day to be able to report on the news of the day. Now, one newspaper a day can handle it. As a result, we have saved a lot of time..." When he said this, the audience responded with knowing smiles. Naturally, only foreign reporters dared to say such public witticisms. If a German reporter was ignorant of current affairs and made some kind of criticism of Propaganda Minister Goebbels' masterpiece—making German newspapers uniform—he would be just asking for trouble.</p>
<p>Half a year ago, an acquaintance saw my room full of British newspapers and found it a bit strange, because in the past, when I was in Germany, my room was always kept very clean. I said, "This is easy to explain. Since the source of news in Germany is not in the newspapers, we save the time we spend reading newspapers and do other things. For example, more contact with the German people can also help us understand the current situation in Germany. The situation in England is different. The British have a habit of not talking, and some people think this is a sign of their profundity, while others think it is precisely because they have nothing to say. In short, it seems to take some effort to get some news out of the British. However, things are so coincidental that the things that British people usually don't want to say are published in British newspapers every day. From the most right-wing Morning Post to the most left-wing Daily Worker, it covers everything. As long as we read one or two dozen British newspapers every day and synthesize the arguments from all sides, it is not difficult to guess some of the inside story... Reading newspapers in England is a happy thing, but at the same time, it is a bit of a "last resort"!..."</p>
<p>Logically speaking, British reporters are British, so why are there such exceptions? On the one hand, it is due to the development of the British news industry. On the other hand, it is said that it is because British reporters are generally good at drinking. Articles in British newspapers are almost all products of their drinking glasses. In the eyes of the British, British reporters almost all have the demeanor of the Chinese poet Li Bai. I remember once at a banquet, just because I drank a little less wine, it aroused the curiosity of several British reporters. At that time, I explained, "This is to be excused, because I am not a British reporter"!</p>
<p>When Will the Japanese Tell the Truth?</p>
<p>Before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, a reporter from a certain country specifically went to visit the Japanese military attaché in that country to inquire about the situation in the Far East. The central question of the conversation was whether war would break out between China and Japan in the near future. The military attaché replied: "What? Japan is preparing for war? The Japanese want war? That's just a set of rumors! We have always been a peace-loving nation. Isn't war the most meaningless thing?..."</p>
<p>The reporter found it funny at the time and asked, "After your country obtained Manchuria, what methods do you intend to use to protect it?"</p>
<p>The military attaché said: "By peaceful means. The Far East issue is fundamentally an economic issue. Japan has never advocated a policy of force and only hopes to survive... How terrible is war! We Japanese have never thought about this! War, 'no'! A thousand 'no's'..."</p>
<p>When this reporter described this, he asked the people present, when will the Japanese tell the truth?</p>
<p>The following is another reporter's story about his encounters with a Japanese reporter.</p>
<p>According to him, he met a Japanese reporter in London two years ago. They had a close relationship, and they met two or three times a week. When this Japanese reporter came to see him, he would sit for two or three hours. This Japanese reporter did not like to talk much, and most of the time he sat on the "sofa" chair and read his newspapers and magazines alone. However, he admitted that this Japanese reporter was a good person, so they got along well. One day, the London Foreign Correspondents Association had a banquet, and he took an acquaintance girl with him. At the banquet, he introduced the girl to the Japanese reporter as usual. A few minutes later, the Japanese reporter, probably drunk, praised the girl in front of everyone, saying that she was really cute. Then he asked her for her address and phone number. Finally, he even asked her to go out to dinner with him, saying that he had his own car, which finally made the girl blush, and even the people present felt embarrassed.</p>
<p>The next morning, the Japanese reporter felt that something had happened and ran to apologize to his friend, saying that he had made a fool of himself because he was drunk. "Normally," the Japanese reporter said, "I don't say what I think in my heart, and what I say is not what I think. Last night, I drank a little too much, so I unknowingly revealed the truth." The Japanese reporter's apology did not seem to get the other party's sympathy. Europeans are Europeans after all. The reporter believed that the Japanese reporter had deceived his friendship, and had never told him the truth in the past.</p>
<p>"So," he said, "at least the Japanese will tell the truth after drinking."</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese</p>
<p>In Europe, we are often mistaken for Japanese. Europeans have a very simple way of distinguishing between Chinese and Japanese people, that is, people who are dressed neatly are Japanese, and the opposite is Chinese. This convenient method naturally causes them to make mistakes often. After we explain, they always come up with a stock apology: I really can't tell the difference, please don't take offense. Naturally, when the average European can really tell the difference between who is Chinese and who is Japanese, we will probably also know who is English and who is Scottish.</p>
<p>What is the difference between Chinese and Japanese people? Some people say that Japanese people are shorter. However, this standard is also difficult for Europeans to see, because many overseas South Chinese are not much taller than Japanese people in terms of height.</p>
<p>According to an acquaintance's usual explanation to Europeans, he put forward two points: first, Japanese people have yellower skin than Chinese people. Japanese women wearing makeup are naturally an exception. Second, Japanese people's legs are short and a little curved because they don't use chairs and "sit cross-legged" every day. Of course, their posture is not as natural as Chinese or Europeans when walking on the street. His statement seems to have helped Europeans a lot. It is said that someone has adopted his identification method, and the results have been quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>A German doctor once asked a Japanese doctor about this question. According to the Japanese doctor's reply, it is easy to distinguish between Chinese and Japanese people. He said: The first characteristic is that Japanese people usually wear glasses, but Chinese people don't. The second characteristic is that most Japanese people carry a camera with them, but Chinese people don't. As for the third characteristic, when Japanese people meet people, the first question they ask is: Where is the toilet?...</p>
<p>This is what the Japanese doctor said. The results of the experiment are naturally impossible to verify. However, we believe that there will be Chinese people who wear glasses, and there will be Chinese people who carry cameras, but there will probably be no Chinese people who ask: Where is the toilet? as the first thing they say to people.</p>
<p>If this Japanese doctor's observation is correct, perhaps Europeans can save a lot of trouble when they encounter us in the future.</p>

<h3>The London Times Comments that Failure May Be Temporary</h3>
<p>[London] The Times said in an editorial today that the report passed by the League of Nations' Committee of Twenty-Three on October 5 at least gave hope that League of Nations member states might each assist China. The declaration of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has dashed this hope. The Chinese representative expressed disappointment at the pitiful result of this international conference, which is sincere. However, we do not see that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference could have achieved anything else. What we must recognize is that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference had more prospects for failure than success from the beginning. The opening of the conference coincided with the echo of US President Roosevelt's great speech in Chicago not yet fading. Expectations were very high at that time, but the result is so disappointing. Each country looks at each other, and none feels that it can take the lead in launching a slightly more active policy. In this environment, each country is bound by harsh realities. However, this kind of constraint may ultimately be beneficial, because it did not pass a resolution to close the door to mediation while Japan was in its current state of arrogance. The first joint attempt to promote peace in the Far East has now failed. This may be temporary, but the British government can have a clear conscience about this failure. The British government is prepared to actively pursue constructive proposals with other countries to achieve its goals. However, past experience has clearly shown that it is useless to initiate the maintenance of international treaties with empty words of support without concrete guarantees. Without such guarantees, the British government can never allow its country to adopt actions that will ultimately become farcical. Regardless, the British government will continue to consult with like-minded countries to seek the early realization of peace in the Far East. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>[London] The Times also said that Japan is said to be willing to have Britain, America, or Germany mediate. Therefore, the moderate attitude adopted by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference may not be bad. In short, the declaration passed by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference does not hinder the continuation of mediation by a committee with a smaller scope of organization among the related countries.

<h3>The Grand Meeting in the Belgian Capital is Over, and Diplomatic Activities in Europe and America are Frequent</h3>
<p>The American Ambassador to Russia Returns Home for Christmas; The Content of the British Lord Privy Seal's Visit to Germany is Confidential; Czechoslovakia Expresses Satisfaction with Talks with Britain and France</p>
<p>[Moscow] The American Ambassador to Russia, Davies, announced today that he intends to return home for a visit, and is scheduled to return to his post in January of next year. Aside from returning home to reunite with his family and celebrate Christmas, there is no other purpose. Rumors that he will succeed Bingham as the Ambassador to Britain are also inaccurate. (25th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the rumor that the American representative, Davies, will come to England at the end of this week, although it has not been confirmed by the local authorities, political figures believe that the American representative will come to England in a private capacity, hoping to learn the truth about the talks between the British Lord Privy Seal Halifax and Hitler, and report it to President Roosevelt. The American Ambassador to Britain, Bingham, is currently in the United States due to illness. (25th Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels  Britain invited diplomats from the United States and France to hold a meeting in London on November 29th and 30th. The United States specially appointed Ambassador Davies, who has now declined to attend due to "personal matters" requiring him to return home. (24th National Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels It is rumored that after the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is indefinitely postponed, the chief American representative, Davies, will go to London and then take a ship back home on the 2nd of next month. Members of the American delegation have denied this, saying that before returning home, Davies may go to Paris, but it will be in a private capacity. (24th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Authoritative observers stated today that the failure of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will temporarily suspend the United States' mobilization of world opinion and its diplomatic policies toward aggressor nations. The people mostly maintain a neutral attitude, fearing involvement in war, so the authorities will also have to slightly change their policies. Congress previously believed that the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty could eliminate the disputes in the Far East, but by the time the Brussels Conference opened, Congress was very indifferent. At the same time, domestic public opinion was not as enthusiastic as when President Roosevelt gave his Chicago speech. After Congress held a special meeting, it criticized the Nine-Power Conference and further demanded a continuation of the isolationist policy. Now, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull still advocate international cooperation, and in order to implement this proposal, they plan to widely promote it to educate the public.

<p>[London] Regarding the British Lord Privy Seal Lord Halifax's trip to Berlin, Prime Minister Chamberlain recently declared in the House of Commons that the Lord's trip was purely private in nature, but it was agreed in advance to go to Berchtesgaden on the 19th of this month to meet with the German leader Hitler. As for the results of the talks between Lord Halifax and the German authorities, because both parties have agreed to keep them secret, the French government has not yet been notified. (24th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The political figures here welcomed the British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons regarding the Lord Privy Seal Halifax. It is said that the Prime Minister stated that the British newspapers' comments on this trip were quite erroneous. It is claimed that the meeting between Halifax and Hitler was only an exchange of views, and both sides maintained a reserved attitude, so there were absolutely no concrete results. German policy has already been seen in Hitler's speech, and there will be no change. (25th Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Liberal Party member Mandel stated in the House of Commons today that it is rumored that the British government is now considering allowing Germany to act freely in Austria and Czechoslovakia, in exchange for Germany agreeing not to make any colonial demands within six years. If this statement has no basis, the Foreign Secretary should make a clear statement. However, Mandel's move was dissuaded by the Speaker. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the content of the talks between the Lord Privy Seal Halifax and the German authorities, since Prime Minister Chamberlain refused to explain it to the House of Commons, opposition Liberal Party, Labour Party, and even some members of the Conservative Party have expressed dissatisfaction, believing that the demands made by Germany are unknown to the outside world. European countries may gradually have the impression that Germany has ambitions for Central Europe, and Britain may also agree to it. Therefore, the general public hopes that the truth will be revealed after the French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos come to London on the 28th of this month. Also, when the House of Commons met yesterday, Liberal Party member Mandel advocated starting a debate. Although the Labour Party members agreed, they ultimately agreed to postpone the discussion until after the French Prime Minister Chautemps and his party came to England. In short, Prime Minister Chamberlain's prestige has already been affected. Some Conservative Party figures have even expressed that Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden are in fact implementing a dual foreign policy, and the current diplomatic situation is already棘手(difficult to handle), and now it is even more chaotic. (25th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] The newspapers have been commenting on the matter that Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos are scheduled to go to London on the evening of the 28th of this month and hold talks with the British authorities on the 29th and 30th of this month. Among them, the right-wing Paris Echo stated, "This diplomatic talk may become the most important talk since the end of the European War. Up to now, Britain and France have been able to unite to face Germany. Even on the issue of Central Europe, Britain and France do not intend to abandon the principle of collective security. France does not intend to abandon the mutual assistance agreements it has signed with certain countries in the past sixteen years. It seems that the colonial issue will occupy an important part of the talks between the British and French authorities." The Radical Socialist Party's Business Report stated, "The British government will seek the French government's consent to determine whether the talks between Britain and Germany can continue. German leader Hitler is said to have written to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that he was not completely satisfied with the talks he had with the British Lord Privy Seal Halifax. That is, the alliance between Britain and France is also seen as strong and close. Germany will not withdraw Italy and take action. The United States, Britain and France may one day economically oppress our two countries, and we are considering how to deal with it." The Socialist Party's People's Report stated that the proposals made by Germany, "If they are as reported by the newspapers, then they are unacceptable to France. If they are the result of the talks between the British Lord Privy Seal Halifax and the German leader Hitler, then Halifax's trip can be said to have been a complete failure, and the British government can only admit it." (25th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The "Yorkshire Post," known as Foreign Secretary Eden's mouthpiece, recently stated, "The issues that French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos will discuss with key British political figures after coming to England in the coming days are not only the results of the British Lord Privy Seal Halifax's visit to Germany, but also the situation in Spain, the Far East, and the Mediterranean. It is also possible that the South African issue will be discussed together. In addition, if there is time, the negotiations on the British-American trade agreement will also be discussed, because the British-American trade agreement negotiations are closely related to the joint economic action of Britain, the United States, and France. Also, French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos are scheduled to arrive here on the morning of the 29th, led by the Director of Political Affairs of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Massigli, and will immediately begin exchanging views with British politicians. At noon on the 29th, Prime Minister Chamberlain will host a banquet for the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. The talks will continue in the afternoon, and in the evening, Foreign Secretary Eden will host a banquet at his residence. At noon on the 30th, the Foreign Office will host a banquet, and in the afternoon or evening, the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister will depart to return home." (25th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Although political figures here unanimously believe that the diplomatic situation has shown progress due to Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech and the upcoming visit of French politicians to England, newspapers here believe that it is still not appropriate to be too optimistic at this time, because the issues being discussed are very important and complex in nature, and it is initially impossible to guarantee that a solution can be reached. The Times stated that the British-French talks are a natural result of British policy, because British policy always seeks to understand the views of other countries. This kind of British policy will never consider that it has the intention of hurting the German-Italian axis. If there is such a deliberate attempt, it is a most foolish strategy and will definitely fail. Now all difficulties can only be resolved through trust and goodwill. London is fully aware of Germany's demand for equal rights and will make it the goal of negotiations. (25th Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙Prague Regarding the French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos' visit to London, the general public here has expressed satisfaction, believing that this is another indication of close cooperation between Britain and France, which is very beneficial to European peace. As for the news published yesterday by the British Manchester Guardian, which stated that Germany had made a request advocating that Czechoslovakia form a federal government according to the example of Switzerland, it is unbelievable and difficult to believe. In short, if Germany can guarantee Czechoslovakia's independence in its domestic and foreign affairs, Czechoslovakia is willing to establish an understanding with it. (25th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Prepares to Continue Handling the Sino-Japanese Case</h3>
<p>[Geneva] After the Nine-Power Treaty Conference declared an indefinite postponement, well-informed sources here still believe that the League of Nations' Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Problem may hold a meeting around the 10th of next month to continue handling the dispute between China and Japan. People close to the League of Nations are deeply disappointed with the outcome of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, believing that this further proves that any diplomatic action taken outside the League of Nations' structure is bound to fail. The urgent task is to convene the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Problem as soon as possible. Regarding this point, the representatives of the major powers unanimously stated at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference that they should continue to find ways to end the war between China and Japan, meaning that all subsequent negotiations should be conducted by the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Problem. However, when the committee will convene a meeting will depend on the wishes of the Chinese government. Presumably, the Chinese government will consult with the British and French governments before requesting to convene a meeting. As for the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Problem, the Foreign Minister of Latvia, Menders, is currently in Paris holding talks with the French Foreign Minister Delbos. The Chinese Permanent Representative to the League of Nations, the Minister to Switzerland, Hu Shih-tse, is also in this country's capital. The French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos are scheduled to go to London on the evening of the 28th of this month to hold talks with the British authorities. Therefore, the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Problem will not be convened for a meeting before Chautemps and Delbos return home. (25th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Prepare to Resolve War Debts</h3>
<p>Obstacles to Repaying in Installments</p>
<p>[London] Some figures in the financial community here recently declared that after the British-American Reciprocal Trade Agreement is established in the future, the two countries should sign an agreement to resolve the war debt issue with the United States. (25th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The London Daily Mail reported today that Britain will revise the 1922 repayment plan for its war debts to the United States and then repay them in installments. It is claimed that a war debt conference will be held once the proposed British-American trade agreement is signed. The trade agreement negotiations have actually been completed, and the war debt conference will only be a formality. Presumably, the United States will initially demand full repayment, but may make slight concessions later. As for which country's currency will be used for repayment, it has not yet been decided. The two countries will not attempt to link currencies in any way, but because Britain, France, and the United States have established a tripartite currency agreement, the exchange rate between the two countries' currencies may not be affected in any way. It is claimed that this plan was generally agreed upon in mid-July of this year. (25th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Newspapers here today reported that Britain's war debts to the United States will be adjusted together at a future business conference. According to the Daily Express, this issue has been discussed since it was raised in 1934, and after many meetings, fundamental agreement has now been reached, that is, the United States recognizes the 41.5 billion gold pounds paid by Britain from 1923 to 1924 as the principal of the war debts.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Malaya Dismiss Japanese Tenants</h3>
<p>[Singapore] Overseas Chinese throughout Malaya who own real estate are now dismissing Japanese tenants, both residential and commercial. This is a scene of Chinese boycotting the Japanese. It is heard that the Japanese are currently holding a meeting to discuss countermeasures. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Order in Pudong</h3>
<p>The Pseudo-Police Hold Rattan Canes and are Stationed, and Theft Has Been Slightly Reduced; After the Ferry Service Resumed, Many People Went Home to Visit</p>
<p>Pseudo-Police Stationed</p>
<p>The pseudo-police recruited by the Japanese in Pudong, about a hundred, have now been stationed. The pseudo-police station is located in the former Pudong Police Sub-Bureau on Police Bureau Road. Because Pudong is vast and the number of police is insufficient, recruitment is still continuing. It is heard that the quota needs to be filled with 500 people, but the number of applicants is not large. These pseudo-police wear a yellow symbol on their chests and carry a rattan cane, patrolling in teams. Each team of pseudo-police is accompanied by a Japanese soldier. Pseudo-police patrols are present in areas such as Lan Ni Du, Qichangzhan, and Yangjiadu.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Moving Objects</p>
<p>Although incidents such as hooliganism and theft have not yet been suppressed, they have gradually decreased. Residents who return home to move objects are strictly questioned if they are seen, and then released. However, they are only allowed to take small valuables. If they move furniture and other items, they will be stopped. As a result, many objects are left on the road after being stopped. Those who enter and exit empty-handed are not stopped, but they must also be questioned before being allowed to pass. There are no pseudo-police or Japanese soldiers east of areas such as Yangjingmiao and Qichangzhan. There are more pedestrians in that area.</p>
<p>Shops Open</p>
<p>Vegetable vendors in Pudong were allowed to pass a few days ago, but if they are encountered by hooligans, they must pay one yuan per load. Since yesterday, because the Japanese army wanted them to sell in Pudong, some are not allowed to sell in Shanghai. Among the towns in Pudong that were bombed and burned, Yangjingzhen was the most tragic, having become a scorched earth. The houses in the Lan Ni Du area have also been completely destroyed. The towns of Tangqiao and Qichangzhan have also been almost completely destroyed. Residents have also moved away. Only the three towns of Yangjiadu, Laobaitu, and Zhangjiabang have not been completely destroyed, and some have been bombed or burned. Recently, a small number of shops have opened for business, but there are few residents in the town, and no one cares. Only a few rice shops occasionally sell rice in small quantities.</p>
<p>Ferries Carry Passengers</p>
<p>Currently, ferries to Donggou, Gaoqiao, Yangjing, and Qichangzhan in Pudong have resumed carrying passengers, but the schedule is irregular. The fare is thirty cents per person per trip. Recently, more Pudong residents are going back to visit their homes or retrieve small items, so the number of people coming and going at each ferry pier has gradually increased. According to reports, they returned home the day before yesterday (22nd) and left their home on Police Bureau Road this morning (25th), walking east along Dongchang Road to Qichangzhan Wharf to take the ferry to Shanghai. However, at eight o'clock yesterday morning, a small number of passengers who landed from the Quanjia Ge of the Bund were stopped by the Japanese before leaving a certain gate and returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Continued Recruitment of Police</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, yesterday, a certain person who previously served as an inspector in the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau recruited another 150 brothers in Nanshi yesterday morning to go to Pudong. It is heard that after a short period of training, they will continue to be dispatched to various towns in Pudong to resume their posts.</p>
<p>Local Peace</p>
<p>According to a person from Sanlin Township in Pudong yesterday, he returned home a few days ago to see the situation at home. Because most of the residents in the two towns of Sanlin and Yangsi are poor, they did not escape. Now, Cai of Sanlin and Zhang of Yangsi are allowing the area to become desolate, turning into panic. Therefore, they advise the shops in each township to operate as usual. As a result, citizens in each township have resumed their businesses one after another. Even rice and food are sold at a flat price by Cai and others. The area has become peaceful. He went from Sanlin through Yangsi, past Shichang Temple, Yanqiao, to Qijiamiao, and entered Qinci Yangdian to cross the river at Yangjing. He landed at Tongren Wharf. However, after passing through various places, such as Zhangjialou and Qinci Yangdian, he was checked by Japanese soldiers before being released.</p>
<h3>Losses of Shanghai Electric Power Company in the Eastern District of Shanghai</h3>
<p>Many Electricity Meters in Fangpeng Were Destroyed, Worth Approximately 710,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Eastern District of the Public Concession has suffered unusually heavy losses due to the attacks of war artillery fire. The value of the electricity meters and other equipment owned by the American Shanghai Electric Power Company in the area is approximately 710,000 yuan. The labor costs for future sorting and demolition, as well as the damage to real estate, are estimated to cost more than 10,000 yuan, not counting business losses. It is heard that the company has now prepared a detailed report form to be submitted to the American Consulate for future claims for damages. Because the company's business in the Eastern District of Shanghai accounts for half of its total business, the business losses this time are difficult to calculate.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, residents of the Concession paid close attention to the supply of tap water, fearing that water pipes would be bombed or other changes that would interrupt the supply. In view of this, the Waterworks Company, to prevent万一(unexpected incidents), had some enthusiastic engineers provide free assistance in planning emergency measures, planning to draw water from wells to supply residents with drinking water. Various projects were generally prepared, but because the water plant was not affected by the war, there was no need to use it. Fan Keling, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, believed that the Waterworks Company had planned carefully and benefited the residents greatly, and specially sent a letter of thanks and admiration yesterday.</p>
<p>In addition, the British trading company Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. had made every effort to assist the Waterworks Company in planning the above-mentioned measures, and Fan also sent a letter of thanks.</p>
<h3>The Chamber of Commerce Continues to Report Losses of Destroyed Factories</h3>
<p>Counting Xin and Ten Other Factories</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Industry yesterday, continuing to report the losses of destroyed factories. The telegram said, "Respectfully addressed to the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing: Having received your Ministry's telegram, ordering the reporting of factories with capital of more than 200,000 yuan that suffered losses due to the Shanghai War before November 1st, etc., we have notified and investigated separately, and the first batch of 15 factories that reported has been telegraphed in advance.

<h3>The Red Cross International Committee Holds a Regular Fundraising Campaign</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society, initiated by consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai and Chinese and foreign philanthropists, it has spared no effort in carrying out various relief works. However, because a large amount of funds is needed, there is a plan to raise 10 million yuan for use in the next six months. In addition to having telegraphed various charitable organizations at home and abroad to request donations, it is also scheduled to hold a Fundraising Movement Week in Shanghai from the 1st to the 8th of next month (December), sincerely requesting people from all walks of life in this city to actively donate and support this charitable cause. Preparations have now been completed, and the opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at 5:00 pm on December 1st at the American Women's Club on Jing'an Temple Road. At that time, former Ambassador to Soviet Russia, Dr. Yen Hui-ching, the association's board member and chairman, and Father Jacquinot, the vice-chairman, will give speeches. Dr. Baker, the secretary-general, will report on the association's status and progress, welcoming people from all walks of life in China and foreign countries to actively participate. It is also heard that the association is scheduled to hold a music concert at the Great Shanghai Theatre on December 8th, and Mrs. Tang Shixuan is currently responsible for preparing everything. At that time, famous musicians in Shanghai will perform on stage. Once the program is arranged, tickets will be sold publicly. The association has recently printed a kind of calendar for sale, prepared in both Chinese and Western languages, costing one yuan in national currency per copy. All proceeds will be used for relief. Currently, in order to promote various fundraising activities, a Sponsorship Solicitation Office has been set up at 129 Nanjing Road (telephone 28954) to facilitate inquiries and contact from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>British Defense Force Ukrainian Team Went to Hong Kong Yesterday Morning for Transfer to India</h3>
<p>Defense Was Taken Over by the Douhan Team</p>
<p>The Ukrainian Infantry Team of the British Garrison in Shanghai was ordered to be stationed in Shanghai after the Shanghai War, and has been here for three months. It has now been ordered to transfer to India. At 11:00 am yesterday, they boarded small boats from the New Customs Wharf to Wusongkou, where they were transported to Hong Kong by the British transport ship Dilwara, and then transferred to India. Because the team had worked hard to rescue refugees in western Shanghai during its stationing in Shanghai, many people from all walks of life in this city went to the New Customs Wharf to bid farewell. The British Douhan Infantry Team, which had just arrived in Shanghai, also sent a military band to the wharf to play farewell songs. From now on, the defense left by the Ukrainian team will be taken over by the Douhan team.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Organized a Repatriation Service Group</h3>
<p>The First Batch of Sixty People Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday; The Remaining Three Batches Will Also Return Home One After Another</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the all-out war of resistance, overseas Chinese in various countries have organized "Repatriation Service Groups," and more than a dozen batches have arrived in Nanjing, with various talents. The overseas Chinese living in Saigon and Annam have also established a "Vietnamese Repatriation Service Group," divided into four groups: rescue, transportation, fire fighting, and consolation. There are a total of 240 male and female youth members who have registered to voluntarily return home and will be divided into four trips to return home. The first batch of 60 people, led by Lin Luying and Zhang Lupeng, arrived in Nanjing yesterday to await the military authorities' dispatch to various front lines to participate in rescue and other work. These 60 people are divided into five small teams. When returning home, they also brought many rescue equipment. The transportation and fire fighting groups of the second and third batches will also depart from Vietnam and return home immediately. The fourth batch, the consolation group, will take longer because of the purchase of consolation items, so they will return home last. According to the returning members, overseas Chinese in various places have also fully mobilized, and have been reporting to local consulates to request to return home to serve the country, willing to contribute the professional skills they have learned to the motherland.</p>
<h3>British Merchant Ships Resume Sailing to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Ships Will Sail into Shanghai on January 7th and 10th</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - The British Steamship Company announced today that its merchant ships will be sailing to Shanghai again in the near future. Ships will sail into the port of Shanghai on January 7th and 10th of next year.</p>

<h3>Quiet as Usual in Shuanglin</h3>
<p>Since the right-wing battles shifted to the area of Jiuguan and Shuanglin, the Shuanglin compatriots in Shanghai are extremely concerned. Besides commissioning the Sino-Western Radio Station (frequency 1040) to solicit and report news every day from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, 6:30 PM to 7:00 PM, and 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM, according to the association's report, Mr. Wang Yangzhen once sent Mr. Wang Xinde from Shanghai to Shuanglin on the 12th. Mr. Wang left Shuanglin on the morning of the 18th and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. At that time, the town was quiet as usual, the silk factory was still operating, and it had not been bombed. Those seeking refuge from other places were extremely crowded in Shuanglin, while very few townspeople had moved away. Furthermore, the route Mr. Wang took from Shuanglin to Shanghai was via Cao'e River in Hangzhou and then via Ningbo to Shanghai, with travel expenses of about thirty yuan per person. Moreover, the association dispatched someone on a special trip to Shuanglin on the 22nd to inquire about news.</p>
<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Discussing the People's Food Problem Again</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Currently, rice shops limit each person to one yuan's worth of rice, presumably because of limited stock, intending to meet the widespread need and achieve an even distribution. However, due to practical limitations, this might not fully achieve the intended purpose. Therefore, considering the crowded rice-buying situation and the difficulty for the elderly, weak, women, and children to obtain rice, the current purchasing method seems to need improvement. Here are a few suggestions for the rice industry gentlemen: ㊀ Limit each person to one yuan's worth to ensure widespread access and prevent people from wasting time and enduring hardship buying rice. Therefore, not only should the number of rice selling locations be increased, but the selling hours should also be extended. ㊁ Disorganized purchasing only allows the strong to get food, while the elderly, weak, women, and children crane their necks in anticipation but cannot easily buy even a scoop of rice or a dou of grain all day long. Therefore, in addition to dispatching police officers to maintain order at each rice-selling location, bamboo or wooden fences should be used. Those who arrive first should buy first, followed by others in order, with orderly entry and exit, so that everyone has an equal opportunity to purchase. ㊂ Limiting grain purchases aims for widespread access, but with Shanghai's large population, five or six sheng of rice is often not enough for a family for one night's meal (excluding restaurants). Therefore, to meet their food needs, many people are used to buy. As a result, there are more and more buyers. Even with scolding and expulsion, the chaotic grabbing cannot be avoided. Therefore, the amount of stock should be considered. Even if it is temporarily impossible to increase the limit to one dan per person, expanding the one-yuan limit to two or three yuan, or even five dou, should be done to prevent families from fearing starvation, and order can be maintained. ㊃ The food problem in Shanghai is a holistic one. It should be planned holistically by all parties in conjunction with the rice industry, not treated as a matter for a single corner or industry.</p>

<h3>The Third Batch of 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived and Were Unloaded Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sufficient Rice and Grain Supply Gradually Stabilizes Public Confidence　Substantial Wheat Stocks in Warehouses, Mills Rushing to Produce Flour　Congestion at Retail Sales, Deliberations Underway to Improve Methods</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the South China Rice Industry Company cooperated to purchase foreign rice and transport it to Shanghai to regulate the people's food supply, rice shops have fully resumed business and are conducting retail sales. The third batch of 30,000 bags, transported by a German ship, arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 AM yesterday. The Rice Shops Association has completed the registration of rice collection and paid for and picked up the goods yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Unloading Completed</p>
<p>The rice ordered by the French company Dafa Foreign Firm from Saigon totals 115,000 bags, shipped to Shanghai in four batches. Each bag weighs 220 pounds, equivalent to one shi and two and a half dou. It is intended for the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the South China Rice Industry Company to regulate the food supply for Shanghai residents. The first batch of 25,000 bags, transported by the British Taikoo Company's Jiaying vessel, has been unloaded after arriving in Shanghai yesterday. All were delivered at the wharf. The second batch of 30,000 bags, transported by the British Jardine Matheson Company's Fusheng vessel, has been unloaded after arriving in Shanghai yesterday. The unloading was completed that evening, and all bags are temporarily stored in warehouses for delivery there.</p>
<p>Fully Restored</p>
<p>Three hundred member rice shops of the Rice Shops Association in the Public Concession, such as Deng Rentai, and two hundred shops in the French Concession, such as Wanchang, have fully resumed business after receiving foreign rice from the Municipal Council and conducting retail sales. Although purchases are limited to one yuan per person, the crowding is severe everywhere. Hotels and congee shops that had temporarily closed yesterday have successively reopened, and meal-packing businesses continue to pack meals for customers. A small number of residents have switched to eating noodles, causing flour prices to soar. The wholesale price of standard flour rose to four yuan and three jiao per bag yesterday, and the retail price is above four yuan and five jiao per bag.</p>
<p>Three Batches Arrived</p>
<p>The third batch of 30,000 bags, transported by a German ship, arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 AM yesterday and docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf in the French Concession. The ship is represented by the German company Melchers &amp; Co. Unloading began at 1:00 PM yesterday, with the Rice Shops Association providing trucks for each rice shop to conduct retail sales. The above foreign rice is delivered at the wharf. The fourth batch is reported to be transported by the British Taikoo Company's Zhejiang vessel, expected to arrive in Shanghai on the evening of the 28th, also with 30,000 bags.</p>
<p>Payment and Rice Collection</p>
<p>The Rice Shops Association handled the payment collection for the member rice shops in the Public Concession and the French Concession, totaling 500 shops, which began yesterday morning. ㊀ Location: Bank of China at 276 Sichuan Road. ㊁ Method: Wharf delivery is 16 yuan and 1 jiao 5 fen per bag, warehouse delivery is 16 yuan and 4 jiao 5 fen per bag, plus an additional fee temporarily calculated at 2 jiao 5 fen per bag. As for the retail method, the limit is still one yuan per person, at 8 fen 5 li per market catty. The distribution method is 40 bags per shop per batch.</p>
<p>Flour Shipped to Tianjin</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the grain industry that the wheat stored in warehouses in Shanghai amounts to quite a lot, totaling about 800,000 bags, which is being rushedly milled into flour by the Fuxin and Fuyi flour mills. Currently, the total flour stock in Shanghai is about 300,000 bags. Furthermore, yesterday the reporter witnessed a large amount of flour being loaded onto the British Taikoo Company's Shuntian vessel for shipment to Tianjin, totaling about 2,000 bags. It is said that this is a pre-war order from Chinese merchants in that port, with the manufacturers delivering the goods in installments.</p>
<p>No Worry About People's Food</p>
<p>As for the food situation in Shanghai, since the transportation obstruction, it has relied entirely on foreign rice and flour. Fortunately, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the South China Rice Industry Company cooperated to purchase foreign rice, which has arrived in Shanghai in batches. At the same time, foreign firms are also ordering foreign rice from abroad, which will be arriving continuously. Therefore, there is no concern about a shortage of food in Shanghai. The crowded conditions of residents buying rice from rice shops will soon return to normal.</p>
<p>Retail Situation</p>
<p>The retail rice shops in the Public Concession, after the Rice Shops Association delivered the first batch of Saigon rice the day before yesterday afternoon, began retail sales at around 1:00 PM yesterday. The limit remained one yuan per person, and each police station dispatched several officers to each rice shop to maintain order. However, due to the large number of people, the rice was sold out in an instant. Those who arrived later, as well as women, children, and the elderly, were unable to squeeze through and returned empty-handed, sighing helplessly. In some places, the police first instructed people to wait in line and purchase in an orderly manner. Although those in the back were unable to buy rice, the order was quite good.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Market West United Association stated that with the arrival of foreign rice in batches to Shanghai in recent days, rice shops have begun retail sales to the market. However, due to the limited quantity and large population, the areas in front of each rice shop are extremely crowded and disorderly. Although Chinese and foreign police officers have tried their best to maintain order, it is difficult to contain the tide. Moreover, those who are strong and powerful can squeeze forward, while others, such as the elderly, weak, women, and children, often wait all day without getting a single grain. Furthermore, cases of people fainting and falling to the ground due to being squeezed, trampled on, and injured are not uncommon, and there is even a risk of life. In view of this situation, the association believes that the retail sales method is not perfect and is not a fundamental solution. It has already appealed to the concession authorities and various groups responsible for people's food to quickly devise a safer and more reliable plan to improve retail sales and avoid accidents.</p>
<p>Aiding Refugees Again</p>
<p>The International Relief Committee was notified by the French Municipal Council the day before yesterday to allocate 800 bags of foreign rice as food for refugees in shelters run by various organizations in the French Concession, which has already been distributed. The committee received another letter from the French Municipal Council yesterday, continuing to allocate 800 bags of foreign rice to be distributed to various shelters within the concession to provide relief. The committee will notify each shelter to bring their seals to the committee to collect warehouse receipts.</p>
<p>Rice Stored in Nanshi</p>
<p>The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain Trade Association, in order to regulate the food supply for the city, purchased 20,000 shi of rice, which was unloaded at warehouses in Nanshi. They were planning to transport it into the concession for retail sales when our army withdrew from Nanshi, and transportation was cut off, making it impossible to transport it out. Recently, due to the shortage of rice in the concession, the rice industry had no rice for retail sales. Therefore, the Miscellaneous Grain Trade Association reported to the Municipal Council, which contacted the Japanese military authorities to prove that the rice in Nanshi was indeed for regulating the food supply within the concession and requested the issuance of a pass to transport it out for sale. The Municipal Council has sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese military authorities. However, the Japanese side needs to consider the transportation issue, so no progress has been made. The 20,000 shi of rice are still stored in Nanshi and cannot be transported out.</p>

<h3>50,000 Refugees Beg for Assistance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Nanshi Refugee Area to Provide Meals　Various Parties Seek to Shelter Street Refugees</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations United Disaster Relief Association, since taking over the affairs of the former City Relief Association, has reorganized the original organization of the Relief Association into the Refugee Relief Branch of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations United Disaster Relief Association, with Qu Wenliu as the chairman, and Gui Yanfang and Zhang Binghui as the vice-chairmen. The association's address remains on the second floor of the Pudong Building. For the 50,000 refugees sheltered by the former Relief Association, the United Disaster Relief Association bears a heavy burden itself and cannot take care of the living expenses and other relief expenses. Therefore, the Relief Branch still bears the expenses independently. As the weather has gradually turned cold in recent days, the refugees are suffering from both cold and hunger. The provision of food and clothing is extremely urgent. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will embrace the suffering and generously donate to the Relief Branch's general affairs group on the second floor of the Pudong Building for verification and collection, so that it can be distributed and used quickly. The names of donors will be published in the newspaper once a week to promote benevolence and a record of donations will be published upon completion to show credibility.</p>
<p>Providing Meals</p>
<p>For the past ten days, various refugee shelters have been distributing noodles due to the interruption of rice supplies. Since the Jiaying vessel arrived with Saigon rice, the shelters are now gradually resuming meals with rice. In the Nanshi refugee area, Father Rao has also purchased 1,600 bags and is preparing pots and fuel. It is expected that cooking will begin in two or three days. The issue of drinking water in the refugee area is also being addressed by the office and the Red Swastika Society. The number of poor households in the area who have run out of food continues to increase. According to the Relief Association, the number has now reached 30,000.</p>
<p>Street Refugees</p>
<p>According to a reporter's investigation, there are currently over 40,000 refugees sheltered in Shanghai by the Charitable Organizations United Disaster Relief Association and approximately 50,000 sheltered by the Relief Branch of the United Disaster Relief Association. A portion are still relying on relatives and friends, but this is difficult to sustain for long. It is estimated that there are no less than 10,000 refugees sleeping on the streets and in the alleys of the two concessions. Therefore, if refugees cannot be relocated, the number will increase. Various parties, including the Shanghai Municipal United Relief Association and the United Disaster Relief Association, are seeking to shelter the homeless refugees on the streets, as this is necessary for humanitarian reasons and also benefits public security. The Shanghai Municipal United Relief Association is currently looking for suitable locations and plans to first shelter the homeless refugees within the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Relocation of Refugees Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>A Batch of Staff Members Depart First</p>
<p>In view of the expanded warfare and inconvenient transportation, the War Zone Refugee Relocation Association decided a few days ago to send 1,000 refugees to Gaochun and Liyang for reclamation. This has now been temporarily suspended, but other places are being sought as alternatives. It is reported that after the person in charge actively sought instructions from the authorities, approval has been granted. As for the staff, more than 50 qualified people have been selected. A batch departed for the interior yesterday, and the rest will be notified by letter after inspecting the situation and reporting back.</p>
<h3>Japanese Mail Ship Asama Maru Still Stranded in Port</h3>
<p>Stranded by Hurricane for Two Months　Unable to Tow, Dismantling Machinery</p>
<p>The Asama Maru of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company, a top-class mail ship sailing in the Pacific Ocean and a sister ship to the Chichibu Maru, was caught in a hurricane in September. The ship was at the mouth of Lei Yue Mun in Hong Kong when the hurricane blew the hull onto the rocky reefs on the mountainside. It has been over two months, and repeated attempts have failed to rescue it. The company has dispatched technicians and a large number of workers to Hong Kong from Tokyo and decided to dismantle and remove the ship's machinery and other items first, transport them back to Japan, leaving an empty shell of the ship, and then tow it back to Japan for reassembly. The ship is one of the three giant mail ships of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company sailing on the US-China San Francisco-Japan-Shanghai line, costing tens of millions of yuan. Unfortunately, it encountered a hurricane and was stranded, resulting in very heavy losses. It is reported that the dismantling of machinery is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Foreign Nationals Fleeing Hangzhou Turn to Ningbo and Shanghai</h3>
<p>Currently About Thirty Foreign Nationals Still Residing in Hangzhou</p>
<p>Due to the escalating warfare, foreign nationals in the Hangzhou area were notified to leave by their respective consulates in Hangzhou. Yesterday, 40 British and American expatriates went to Ningbo and are scheduled to take a ship to Shanghai within days for temporary residence. These included those concentrated in Hangzhou and the Moganshan-Wuxing area. Currently, there are still about 30 foreign nationals residing in Hangzhou. Apart from those who voluntarily do not want to leave Hangzhou or cannot leave due to business reasons, the rest will also come to Shanghai via Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Detailed Record of the Pudong Compatriot Association Sheltering Distressed Compatriots</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the Shanghai war, Pudong was still relatively safe. Therefore, the compatriots from the war zone living in Shanghai all thought that the fields and gardens were habitable and returned to their hometowns one after another. The Pudong Compatriot Association then undertook the task of sending the compatriots back to their villages. By the beginning of October, residents along the Pudong area, either because their homes were destroyed or because they had difficulty making a living, gradually sought help from the Association to be sheltered. The Chinese Medicine Clinic was temporarily used as a shelter and sent to various shelters of the City Relief Association from time to time. The handling situation has been reported. At the end of October, the Shanghai war situation changed, and the number of compatriots who were distressed increased day by day. The 64th meeting of the board of directors resolved to expand the shelter organization and began to set up shelters. The handling situation of the Association in the past two weeks is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Setting Up Shelters</p>
<p>The Association successively established six shelters, with Gao Zhiang, Huang Zanting, Yu Kun, Pan Hongqi, Ling Yongnian, and Chen Jingyu as the managers respectively, sheltering a total of 3,424 refugees. However, it was still not enough to accommodate them, so they consulted with the City Relief Association from time to time to request them to shelter and provide for them. A total of 2,443 people were sent to eight shelters of the City Relief Association and the International Shelter of Jiaotong University. Before November 7th, the Association only had the first, second (Nanjing Road), and third shelters, which were already full. The compatriots who came to the Association to register were like a tide. The City Relief Association was unable to fully accommodate them, causing all of them to crowd the Du Hall, making management difficult. It was not until the refugee area was delineated that they were able to send them in batches. The distribution situation of Pudong compatriots in the refugee area is as follows: 282 people at the Xinbeimen Miscellaneous Grain Association, 243 people at the Leyilou of the City God Temple, 415 people in the Inner Garden of the City God Temple, 150 people at the Huangjiu Association of the City God Temple, 104 people at the Xingxiu Hall of the City God Temple, 150 people at the Yingshui Lou of the City God Temple, 160 people at the Xiangxue Tang of the City God Temple, 650 people at the Cuixiu Tang of the City God Temple, 75 people at the Daxin Photo Studio of the City God Temple, 106 people at the Pearl and Jade Trade Association, 250 people in the Wrapped Garden of the City God Temple, and 150 people at the Iron Trade Association of the City God Temple, totaling 2,735 people. The refugee shelters in the refugee area are now being transferred to the National Disaster Relief Association because the Compatriot Association cannot manage them. However, the Compatriot Association has sent a large amount of food to the International Relief Committee for distribution. The Relief Committee now has sufficient food and does not need assistance. However, there is a great need for clothing and bedding.</p>
<p>Before November 7th, the refugees registered and sheltered by the Pudong Boy Scouts numbered about 2,500, according to the roster. The living expenses were subsidized by the Compatriot Association, in addition to donations from local people. On the late night of the 6th, due to a misunderstanding during the troop deployment of the national army, they came to Shanghai in droves on the morning of the 7th. Apart from the young and strong men who went directly to the Association, the rest were sent to various places. The team is compiling and submitting a report on the distribution situation.</p>
<p>Planning Production</p>
<p>The Pudong Compatriot Association has decided to start with female workers for the refugees' production activities, because there are still a lot of jobs available in Shanghai lace and embroidery shops. The Association has completed the investigation of the various offices in charge, with 27 people having embroidery skills, 11 people having crochet skills, 49 people having gauze skills, 16 people having cigarette rolling skills, and 4 people having velvet rope weaving skills. The Association has sent one person with embroidery skills to Sun Xiangji Factory for employment. Furthermore, the Lunchang Yarn Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, is about to resume work. The factory has sent personnel to notify the Compatriot Association and has sent letters to various reception centers in the city to inform the factory workers to register. The work skills of the compatriots in the reception centers throughout the city have also begun to be investigated in order to allocate work. As various factories in the city, such as cigarette and textile factories, have resumed work one after another, the Association has sent personnel to contact them and ask them to hire workers.</p>
<p>Hygiene Facilities</p>
<p>In addition to setting up a hospital in the Chinese Medicine Clinic, the Pudong Compatriot Association has also specially contracted with Shengsheng Hospital as a maternity hospital for refugees, and has now admitted more than 50 pregnant women. The physicians of the Association's Western Medicine Clinic also take turns to visit various shelters every day for diagnosis and treatment, and provide medicine. The hygiene facilities of various shelters have also been inspected. However, the Western Medicine Clinic does not have hospital facilities, and the number of beds in the Chinese Medicine Clinic is small, so efforts should be made to expand it.</p>
<p>Educational Policy</p>
<p>Due to the environmental conditions, the education of refugees has not been able to proceed according to the original plan and had to be changed. Staff members of the management department are stationed in various shelters of the Association to handle the organization of baojia, so that the refugees' self-government organization has a preliminary form. The future educational policy should also start from subtle influence.</p>
<p>Subsistence Report</p>
<p>At the beginning of the operation of the various shelters run by the Pudong Compatriot Association, the Association allocated living expenses. After being incorporated into the shelters of the City Relief Association, the managers directly received them from the City Relief Association, and a detailed report will be made later. The donated food from the outside world included 970 guangbing, 25,080 big biscuits, 10 bags of flour, 1 shi of white rice, 44 bags of milk cakes, 5,402 buns, 695 breads, 100 catties of green vegetables, 120 pieces of fermented bean curd, and 100 catties of pickled mustard tuber.</p>
<p>In terms of clothing and bedding, Chen Zixin donated 1,000 quilts, Pan Zhiwen raised 900 cotton vests, Zhang Bochu raised 300 pieces, and the Local Association transferred 10,000 pieces, of which 5,000 pieces have been taken. As for the clothes donated from the outside world, there were 2,666 pieces and 31 bolts of factory cloth. In addition to the cotton vests being distributed successively, the clothes and bedding donated by all sectors have been distributed and used.</p>
<h3>Fuel Sources Not Smooth, Fuel Conservation is Used</h3>
<p>Relying Only on Hongji Coal for Supply, Prices are Difficult to Fall Back Temporarily</p>
<p>Due to the lack of fuel sources in the city, the selling price of fuel such as coal and coal balls is still rising. Now in winter, the weather has been cold. In the past, citizens had installed coal stoves at this time and burned them day and night for warmth, so the consumption was very large. Now, it is very difficult to meet the daily cooking needs, and everyone is trying their best to conserve. Apart from those with more complete city housing equipment with water heaters, there are not many people who install coal stoves for heating. According to people in the coal industry, the current fuel consumption of citizens is almost less than half of what it used to be. It is also said that the current fuel sources rely only on the supply of Hongji white coal dust and Kailin coal, but the amount is only about 20,000 tons per month each. Although the firewood and charcoal industry association has tried its best to dredge the supply, it is difficult to expect the goods to arrive in a short period of time. Furthermore, the coal stored in various warehouses in Pudong has not been able to be taken out in large quantities. Therefore, judging from the current situation, fuel prices are still difficult to fall back temporarily.</p>
<h3>A Large Amount of Cabbage Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Shipped by Shuntian Vessel　Will Be Available in the Market in a Few Days</p>
<p>Recently, vegetable market prices have already fallen back due to the continuous arrival of Pudong cabbage, spinach, and golden flower vegetables to Shanghai. However, obstacles suddenly occurred from the day before yesterday, causing prices to rise slightly again. It is reported that when Taikoo Company's Shuntian vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, it carried a large amount of Shandong cabbage, which will be available in the market immediately. At the same time, the Pudong vegetable supply has been dredged through negotiations by the relevant authorities and will continue to arrive in Shanghai immediately. Therefore, prices should fall back immediately.</p>
<h3>The Postal Administration Calls for Collection of Pudong Mail</h3>
<p>Specially Set Up a Place　Waiting for Collection</p>
<p>The Postal Administration has specially set up a place on the third floor of the General Bureau on Sichuan Road to facilitate the collection of letters, savings, and remittances from post offices in Pudong that have been removed.</p>
<h3>The Bank of Communications Denies Public Bonds Being Robbed</h3>
<p>The News Reported is Inaccurate</p>
<p>It was reported the day before yesterday that the Bank of Communications transported two boxes of National Salvation Public Bonds, totaling one million yuan, from Shanghai to Tongzhou. Outside Wusongkou, they were intercepted and searched by the Japanese army, and the two boxes of National Salvation Public Bonds were robbed. According to a spokesman for the Bank of Communications, the bank has not transported any National Salvation Public Bonds recently. The reported events are completely untrue.</p>
<h3>Xu Zaochun Consults</h3>
<p>Xu Erkang's son, Zaochun, a specialist in external injuries, used to consult in Nanshi and in the Hongkou branch. Now that these areas have become war zones, he has taken refuge in the Special District and set up a clinic at No. 8, Shudeli, Weier Meng Road, west of the Nanjing Grand Theatre on Edward Road. It is also heard that Dr. Xu, valuing this extraordinary period, treats refugees seeking consultation with the spirit of relief and does not count the rewards. Moreover, Dr. Xu's surgical skills are excellent and bring life back to spring, truly a blessing for patients seeking refuge in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Chen Xiaobao and Son Consult</h3>
<p>Famous gynecologist, Chen Xiaobao, and his son, Pan Gen Da Nian, used to live in the Sanpailou in the city. Now, for the convenience of medical treatment, they have moved to No. 616, Julai Road, Siming Village Entrance, French Concession, and consult as usual.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, We have just seen the "Wartime Affairs Agency Communication" published in your newspaper, which states that "According to news from the Hushi area in this city, our large army is gathered in Huzhou, and the terrain is dangerous, making it difficult for the enemy to attack. They have changed their strategy and used naval marines to advance towards the southwest bank of Taihu, attempting to land in Jiapu, cut off the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, enter Yixing to the north, and invade Changxing to the south, attacking the back of Wuxing." Upon investigation, our agency has not received this news. We do not know what the Wartime Affairs Agency is basing this on. Fearing that the rumors are inaccurate, in addition to sending a letter to the agency to inquire, we are specially writing to your newspaper to request a prompt correction to avoid misunderstandings. We cannot express our hopes enough. Sincerely, The Executive Committee of Hushi, November 25th.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Nantong Lines Continue Uninterrupted Navigation</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Hong Kong Route Passengers Extremely Crowded, World Liners Actively Preparing to Resume Services</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Nantong shipping lines have recently experienced disruptions due to the war. However, the Shanghai-Nantong line is the only transportation artery between Shanghai and the inland areas. Mail, cargo, and refugee transportation all depend on the ships on this line. The Shanghai-Ningbo line is also essential because various salted goods from Shanghai are supplied by Ningbo. At a time when vegetables are scarce, the need for this line is even greater. Moreover, there are many people from Ningbo and Shaoxing living in Shanghai, and all business and other exchanges rely on this shipping line. Therefore, the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association, at the request of fellow provincials, specially sent Wu Yaqin and Li Yaoting as representatives to Ningbo to explain to the authorities the reasons for requesting the resumption of navigation. This has already been approved, but the order to suspend navigation may still be given when necessary. The two representatives, Wu and Li, returned to Shanghai by the "Deping" ship yesterday morning to report. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has decided to operate the Shanghai-Ningbo line as usual. The "Deping" ship, after arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, still sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo at 3:00 PM with many passengers. As for the Shanghai-Nantong route, although the traffic above Nantong has been disrupted, it has been restored after all parties have made every effort to clear the way. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Enderby" ship is scheduled to sail through at 8:00 AM this morning. The ships of Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire companies operating on this route are also operating as usual to facilitate traffic. As for the Hong Kong-Shanghai route and world liners, in addition to some resuming services, the rest are also actively preparing to resume services on the Shanghai line. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Nantong Line Changed to Irregular Ships</p>
<p>The foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Nantong line are the five Butterfield &amp; Swire company's ships: "Wuhu", "Wuxue", "Tonghe", "Pinghe", and "Enderby". They were originally regular liners, but now they have been changed to irregular liners. Their announcement is as follows: "Our company's Tongzhou liners are now temporarily suspended. The date of sale will be announced later. This is hereby announced." As for Jardine Matheson's "Tonghe" ship, it is scheduled to sail through today. The Italian China Navigation Company's "Enderby" ship will sail through after returning to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Taizhou Line Changed to Departure Today</p>
<p>Butterfield &amp; Swire's "Shin Fuk" ship operates on the Shanghai-Dinghai-Taizhou line and is managed by the Tai Kee Business Company. Tickets had already been sold, and it was originally scheduled to sail to Taizhou yesterday, but due to weather conditions en route, it must return to Shanghai this morning. Yesterday, a special announcement was made to change the departure from Shanghai to 3:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hong Kong Passengers Extremely Crowded</p>
<p>Although the Shanghai-Hong Kong route is currently clear, the number of ships traveling back and forth has decreased, so passengers are extremely crowded. According to news from the travel agency, the German ship "Godafoss", which sails to Hong Kong today, has even its steerage seats fully booked, so those in the aft cabins have no way to purchase tickets and have to postpone their departure. It is also learned that various foreign shipping companies are now planning to dispatch ships to facilitate travel, so that there will be more than two ships traveling between Shanghai and Hong Kong every week.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Trade Gradually Becomes Active</p>
<p>After the war shifted west, world liners from various countries actively prepared to resume services in Shanghai. Butterfield &amp; Swire, located in Pudong, had its first ship ("Tlengarry") arrive in Shanghai on the 20th of this month to load goods. This was previously reported. It is now learned that the company's second ship, "Sarpadon", was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday (24th), but due to congestion of goods along the way, it was changed to today (26th) to enter the port. As for the third ship, "Deucalin", it was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 26th, with only 37 quintals of cargo. Now, because Hong Kong has another large shipment of 2,700 tons reported to be loaded on the ship for transportation to Shanghai, it has also been rescheduled to enter the port on the 2nd of next month. Judging from this situation, Chinese and foreign trade is gradually becoming active.</p>
<h3>Serial Burglaries in the International Settlement</h3>
<p>Firearms Seized in Both Places</p>
<p>The home of Wang Shao-cheng, located at No. 83 Shunte Road, Shanghai, was suddenly invaded by six bandits on the 21st of this month, who robbed more than 500 yuan of property. Afterwards, the victim found a card on the ground with the name Zhao Renrong written on it. On the back was written: "Mr. Wu Yi-ping, Room 18, Ji Sheng Zhan, Fujian Road, Fuzhou Road." Based on this information, the police reported it to the detective department. Chinese detectives Jin Haibo and others investigated based on the card and successively arrested the bandits Wu Yi-ping, Wu Xu-shi, Wu Gui-zhen, Xu He-an, Fan Heshang, Zhao Renrong, Wang Zhigang, Xu Cai-xiao, Wang A-jin, Shen Hong-sheng, Wei A-rong, Ren Fu-hua, Shen Jin-lan, Wei A-xiang, and 14 men and women in total at Ji Sheng Zhan and other places. Two pistols and twelve bullets were seized and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. At 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, Chinese and Western detectives arrested six accomplices at No. 65, Lane 460, Avenue Edward VII and No. 73, Lane 162, Chengdu Road: Liu Genrong, Xu Linsheng, Zhang A-gen, Zhang Defu, Shen Ziliang, and Hu A-wei. One pistol and eight bullets were seized and taken to the New Gate Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. The police lawyers Qian Xunjiu and Wang Yuetang requested detention and joint trial. The court ordered detention pending a joint hearing rescheduled for the 29th.</p>
<p>Also, Jing'an Temple Police Station Chinese Detective Chief Chang Su Wu Chengmo and others arrested the bandits Yu Jinsheng, Zhang Shiliang, Zhang Shenshi, Shen Shaotang, Shen Xashi, Gu Guoyue, Shen Chengjin, Fang Lizhi, Fang Zhoushi, Shen Yingzhou, Yuan Wanjin, Jiang Mengdao, Hong Jiangshi, and 13 people in total at No. 47 Putuo Road and No. 104, Lane 979, Tokyo Road. Two Mauser pistols and ninety-two bullets were seized and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. After questioning by Judge Dai, the court ordered a further review rescheduled.</p>
<h3>French Concession Cracks Down on Red Pill Organization</h3>
<p>Many Male and Female Offenders Arrested, Yesterday's Trial Postponed for Further Investigation</p>
<p>French Police Detective Bieye (transliteration), accompanied by Chinese detectives Mao Jinsheng and Liu Jinrong, etc., inspected pedestrians in the area of Avenue Petain at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday. They saw a Suzhou woman, Qian Youshi (30 years old), whose behavior was suspicious. They immediately stopped her and searched her, finding six packages of red pills, totaling three thousand pills, and five or six packages of morphine on her person. Under questioning, she confessed that the organization was located on the third floor of No. 15 Ji An Li, Zhengjia Muqiao Street. The detectives rushed to the address and seized thirty-nine packages of red pills, half a large bowl of morphine, and many instruments and raw materials for making red pills. All were taken back to the police station. Later, they went to the second floor of No. 7 You Yi Li, Lane 58, Baliqiao Street, and arrested two accomplices, Pang Hongshi and Du Asheng. Dozens of packages of red pills and morphine, as well as smoking paraphernalia, were seized. Also, in a certain lane on Avenue Hoche, two accomplices, Lin Ajin and Xue Yongfu, were subsequently apprehended. One package of red pills and equipment for smoking red pills, such as lamps and guns, were seized and taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were all sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The Police Department lawyer Yao Zhaodi explained the case and requested a postponement for further investigation. After questioning by Judge Sun Pengxian, he ordered the defendants to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Tragic Love Triangle</h3>
<p>Both Man and Woman Injured</p>
<p>Yang Bofan, a local doctor of traditional medicine living at No. 6 Qing'an Fang, Avenue Freligny, French Concession, has a thriving practice and a wealthy family. However, Yang is naturally lustful. He previously became acquainted with Yu Bin, a woman from Songjiang, who is 29 years old this year. They lived together, and their love was deep. Yu Bin has a younger sister named Xiao Mei, who is 21 years old this year. She is slender and often visits her sister's place. Over time, she began to exchange glances with her sister's husband, and then she had physical relations with Yang Bofan. This has now been discovered by Yu Bin, who became extremely jealous and quarreled with Yang all day long. Yesterday morning, around 10:00 AM, Yu Bin suddenly took a pair of sharp scissors and stabbed Yang in the neck while he was fast asleep. Yang was startled awake by the pain and shouted loudly for help. At this point, Yu Bin, seeing that she had caused trouble, also had suicidal thoughts. She then stabbed herself twice in the neck with the sharp scissors. When the people living together heard the alarm and rushed over, they pushed open the door and went inside to check. They saw Yang and Yu lying in a pool of blood. They immediately reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. Both injured people were sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is reported that Yang's injuries are very serious and may be life-threatening.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Explains Transit Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday replied to the Zhenjiang County Liquor and Sauce Industry Association, explaining the nature of the transit tax. The letter stated: "In response to your letter of the 24th of this month, asking whether it is legal for the customs to still require the payment of transit tax on imported native liquor, we have investigated the matter. According to the Ministry of Finance order, 'those who have already paid the transit tax at other ports of entry or have already paid the consolidated tax, mineral tax, or tobacco and alcohol tax will be exempted from collection.' Therefore, it is inappropriate for the Zhenjiang Customs to require the payment of transit tax on liquor that has already paid the fixed amount of native liquor tax. As for the import of native liquor in this city, no liquor merchants have yet complained about the repeated payment of transit tax. Presumably, there is no such situation. This is hereby replied for your information."</p>
<h3>Sun Muquan's Debt Court Approves Compromise</h3>
<p>Debt Amount Reaches More Than 10,000 Yuan, Court Schedules Creditors' Meeting</p>
<p>The First Special Court accepted the case of Sun Muquan's application for debt compromise. The debtor's debt amount reached 10,250 yuan, while the estimated assets were less than 2,600 yuan, which is a huge difference from the amount of debt. Since the case was accepted by the First Special Court, the compromise has been approved, and the first creditors' meeting has been scheduled. The main points of the delivery notice are recorded below: ㊀ Supervisor's name: Judge Jiang Gongliang; ㊁ Supervisor's assistant: Accountant Yu Xiji; ㊂ Location of the compromise: No. 37 Duofu Li, Fuxu Road; ㊃ Deadline for debt declaration: From now until December 15th of this year; ㊄ Date and location of the creditors' meeting: 2:00 PM on December 23rd of this year at the Nanyang Public School Alumni Association, No. 540 Continental Arcade, Nanjing Road.</p>
