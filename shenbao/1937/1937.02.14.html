<h3>林內閣的產生</h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>陸軍部喊口令——</p>
<p>“向右一轉………”</p>
<p>不服這口令的都被懲罰了：“左傾”份子成為“思想犯”，若不表示“轉向”，就再也呼吸不到鎮窗外的空氣了。十二分“右傾”的也不許，發動“二，二六”事變的那批軍人，就吃了大虧。此外，依着口令向右轉而轉不够魚度的也不行——宇垣自以為他是陸軍大將，總可以合格了，然而也終於上不了台。</p>
<p>誰不知道呢，一個“向右轉”該轉九十度。並且誰也知道——</p>
<p>前進的目標是——“大日本主義”。</p>
<p>前進的路線是——“大陸政策”。</p>
<p>然而，被陸軍部認為轉得合度的經理大臣，自“九，一八”至現在，就沒有出現一個。</p>
<p>“九，一八”以前，曾做過三任陸軍大臣，一任朝鮮總督的宇垣，也才是去年八月才卸任的。宇垣是一個有“手腕”有“才幹”的軍人兼政治家這是各報紙都公認的。但是，“良醫之子，而‘死於病’，出身於陸軍的宇垣，却遭陸軍的反對而失敗了。</p>
<p>並非宇垣拒絕向右轉”而是𤦚陸軍部以為地不能轉合度數。也並非他不知那目標與路線，而是恐怕“開步走”的時候，他沒有“統制”的强力·</p>
<p>現階段的內閣使命是：完成“準戰時體制”。“準戰時體制”內，包括着——㊀國防强化·㊁庶政一新·㊂肅軍。</p>
<p>關於“肅軍”工作，經過去年的幾次“陸海軍大異動”，已經差不多完成了。軍部（陸軍佔領導地位）提出的“行政機構改革案”，就是“庶政一新”的內容。很明顯的，軍部要求的政府，是一個“統制強化”的政府。軍部要求的議會，是一個不得干涉政府的議會。同時，政府及議會，都必須尊重“國防第一主義”，承認軍事費澎漲為當然，必然。</p>
<p>宇垣組閣，是“肅軍”達成的障礙。陸軍曾有過這樣的反對聲明。</p>
<p>軍不能肅，政必不能新；政不能新，國防第一主義以至大日本主義，必不能實現——這是陸軍部的邏輯。</p>
<p>如何證明宇垣是肅軍達成的障碍呢？陸軍根據宇垣的歷史説話：清浦內閣時的陸軍大臣宇垣，曾將陸軍减節四個師團：清田內閣時的陸軍大臣宇垣·曾成立倫敦軍縮條約——陸軍部所謂的“軟弱條約”。</p>
<p>今日的宇垣，是否再主張縮軍，那是可以不問的。總之，現在應該積極擴張軍備的時代，必須絕對排斥宇垣，所以宇垣失敗了。</p>
<p>繼宇垣拜受大命的，也是陸軍大將—林銑十郎。</p>
<p>林銑大將的威名，是在“九，一八”時期，才轟動起來的。那時的林大將，是朝鮮軍司令官。“九，一八”事變後，林大將卽不待上級長官的命令，各自率兵衛過滿洲去了。按常理，林大將若未得上級長官的命今，是不宜有此自由行動的。所以“九，一八”後的林大將，便被稱為越境將軍了。（見一月三十日讀資）</p>
<p>其次，陸軍青年將校襲擊重臣元老的“二，二六”事變，是在林大將身任陸軍大臣的時期發生的。為此事變，林大將才退休下來。現在呢？主動“二，二六”事變的一部份青年將絞，有處死刑的，有自殺了的，有監禁着的，又經過廣田內閣時寺內陸相的幾次“肅軍”，當然沒有多大問題了吧—正在此時，林大將出馬組閣了。</p>
<p>對於林大將組閣，現陸軍首腦部，已經表示贊成了。但，一面贊成，一面也就表示了對於林大將的“冀求”。這“冀求”是：“國防充實，軍規肅正及庶政一新之斷行”。</p>
<p>為達成以上目的，現在卽應實行：㊀多數大臣兼任（在軍部提出過的“行政機構改革案”中，有機關合併以便統制强化等意見）。㊁未脫離既成政黨之黨人，不許入閣。㊂解散現議會。（據讀實）</p>
<p>對於這些“冀求”，在實行方面，林大將當然己經為劃過了，否則也就不能出馬吧。以“越境將軍”之勇，想來是可以實現此種强力內閣的。</p>
<p>陸軍部一直在演着主角·再看看其他方面吧。</p>
<p>廣田內閣總辭職的最近原囚，由於寺內陸相與濱田代議士（政友會黨員）的衝突，一般的説來，也就是陸軍部興議會的衝突。但在當時，永野海相，也會演了一個重要的脚色——調和軍部與政黨的妥協脚色。海相的調和奔走，實質上就證明陸軍海軍首腦部的意見不一致。海陸軍意見有不一致的地方，本不是最近才開始的。遠的且不説：看近年來海軍主張的“南進論”與陸軍的“北進論”，就明白了。但“北進論”顯然是佔優勢的。“九，一八”以來的種種事實，都證明了。所以，今日的軍部，實質上是陸軍部領導着的。不過，陸軍要奪取完全勝利，只有在海軍“協贊”或“靜觀”的條件下，才有完全勝利的可能。陸軍反對宇垣時，海軍“靜觀”，陸軍便勝利了。今天（一月三十日）陸軍表示支持林內閣，海軍也在“靜觀”態度下，陸軍當然又可以勝利。若海軍表示相反的意見，那也是不會成功的。日本歷史上，這樣的例子不少．但，海軍在“靜觀”着，這是慎重，也是留下將來发言的地位吧。</p>
<p>民政黨曾表示支持宇垣，政友會也會對宇垣表“靜觀”的好感，但在宇垣苦於陸軍反對時，連絲毫聲援的行動也不曾有過。眼睜睜看着宇垣落馬，宇垣落馬後，政民兩黨更膽寒了。陸軍部所指的“旣成政黨”，卽是政民兩大黨。現在，政民兩黨，直面着解散議會的危機了。但對於負有解散使命的林大將，也還未敢表示積極的反對態度。這分明是不可挽回的憲政沒落了。</p>
<p>資本家及新聞界，對於宇垣，一般的在表面上算是摔過塲了。新興的住友財閱和野口財閥，與宇垣的關係特別深。當已表示特別的支持。但，暴騰着的軍需股票跌價了，這便是宇垣的一個致命打擊。近年來的日本景氣，事實只不過是軍需工業的　　吧了。只有軍需工業資本家暗中反對，宇垣也就難於立足。何况和宇垣正面面突的，便是直接助長軍需景氣的陸軍部。對於林大將登台，三菱银行的意見是：“歲出膨漲及統制經濟之强化是不可避的。……”三井銀行只對大藏（財政）大臣的人選表示意見：“我們所希望的大藏大臣，是有豐富的財政經濟見識，而又通曉現下一切情勢的人物。”三井和三菱，是日本最大的金融資本家。雖然三井，三菱的獨佔的對立正不能解决，但資源興市塲擴大的目的是相同的。而市塲的擴大與獨佔是不能不用軍力的，所以，當然要支持林大將內閣了，雖然支持的程度不同。</p>
<p>林內閣出現以后，日本政治的法西色彩更濃厚了——這是各方面一致的觀察。</p>
<p>明倫會等法西色彩較邊的團體，曾鼓舞軍部反對宇垣，現在當然要鼓舞林大將了。</p>
<p>總之，在此金融資本互爭“獨佔”的階段上，中產階級恐慌了，勤勞大衆的負担更重了。旣成政黨在分化，法西政黨正抬頭，自由主義的憲政沒落了。同時，國際間的戰爭危機更深了。</p>

<p>星期論壇</p>
<h3>論會考問題</h3>
<p>— 吳世昌</p>
<p>中國近年來中等以上的敎育，有顯著的長進；雖然離我們理想的標準還很遠，但比起民國二十年以前那種不安和敷衍的情形來，顯然不同：受敎育者人數的增加，各校設備的充實，負敎育之責的各級政府當局的認眞負責，各種學術研究的進步，都使我們在這危疑震盪的國難中得到一點快慰。但是仍有許多方面，我們覺得目前亟求改進的必要的。現在先説會考這一個問題。</p>
<p>會考是四五年來各省敎育當局最認真最努力舉行的一樁大事可是始終只限於中學而不及大學，這是使我們感覺到頗有商量的必要的。中學會考的好處，一般人都能見到：無非可以齊一中學的程度，使中學的敎員和學生都認真敎讀。（我説‘齊’而不説“提高”，因為中學敎本有一定標準，會考試題不能超過敎本之上。）但是因它而生的弊端，却很少有人注意。就我們所知道的，至少有下列幾種：第一，大多數（也許是全體）的學校為競爭會考成續的名次，在初高中第三年的下學期，簡直不授正式的功課，專敎學生練習各種試題，和應付考試的種種技術，對於正經的學業，反而拋棄不管。這無異把中學敎育整個的打了一個八四折。至於課外讀物的絕緣，一般常識訓練的缺乏，那是不必等到第三年的下學期，早就有了的現象。第二，有許多學校本來程度較低，敎員較差，只好用種種不合理的方法壓迫學生讀死書，天天翻來覆去的做考題，甚至於廢止例假，開夜班等等，影響於少年心身的健康者甚大。程度好的學校為競名次，也有這種情形，二十三年江蘇全省會考第一的某中學因為太不注重學生健康而受當地人士攻擊，便是很好的例子。第三，有許多中學恐怕全班學生會考的平均分數低，在呈報會考時把一部分成績較次的學生匿而不報，使他們永遠不得升學的機會：去年暑假北平匯文中學學生輿學校打官司的風潮，便是因此而起。至於一個高中畢業生如果要升學，在一個暑期中要經過畢業考試，會考，大學入學考試的三級跳遠，是不是合理，也是一個值得考慮的問題。凡此種種，大概是當初主張中學會考制度者所沒有想到的。</p>
<p>中學會考制度的利弊，需要極正確的調查來加以衡量，才能决定今後此制的改革或存廢。但我們從大體看來，中學會考遠沒有大學會考的急需而必要。中學生不需也不必個個升入大學，所以一般心身的訓練，生活上廣泛知識的獲得，賓在比試題的反覆演習要重要得多。中學的課程往往每周在三十小時以上，一小時上課得二小時的預備和作業，外加軍事訓練，紀念周等等，一天不能有二十五小時，再要時時演習考試的技術，如何會有功夫獲得廣泛的知識，養成課上閱讀的習慣，如何不影響他們正在發育的心身的健康呢？其次，中學的敎材比較有標準，只要敎員認真敎授，程度相差不至太遠，不像大學中有些學門，全靠敎授研究的結果來施敎，程度上可以有很大的懸殊，需要有較高的水準來加以比量。所以中學是不是需要會考，很有商量的餘地，而大學的會考，在種種方面看來都比較切要。但要討論大學會考的利弊，我們必須先把這制度的方法略為説明，才有根據。我們現在姑且提出幾條具體方案如下：</p>
<p>㊀全国各大学的畢業考試概由國家主持。經過國家考試合格者始得授與學位。</p>
<p>㊁此項考試可由敎部聘各大學敎授及學術界耆宿組專家委員會主持之。這個委員會之下就不同的科目組若干小組委員會，（如物理組委員會，歷史組委員會等。）小組委員會擬就試題送敎部，敎部擇定後密頒各大學待位生受試，全國同日舉行，由各該大學行政人員監考。試卷呈敎部轉發各委員評閱，合格者由敎部授予學位，否則不得自稱某大學畢業或“×學士”。</p>
<p>㊂此項考試凡國立或立案的私立大學肄業三年以上者均得應試，為獎勵寒士計，非大學學生，凡有著作，於學術上確有貢獻，經專門委員若干人以上之認可，亦得應試。（理工學生有實騐，限制或可稍嚴。）</p>
<p>㊃此項考試每系應考課程須賅括該系主要課程，至少須在十種或十五種以上，一科可以考一天或兩天。時間可延長至一月左右，以資休息預備。本屆不取學生下屆可再考。</p>
<p>㊄應試學生事前由各校呈報敎部，個人應試向各地敎局報名轉呈，由敎部發給編定號碼，試卷概用號數，不用姓名校名。現在各地大學敎育不合理的情形尚多，但如果要改革，往往因為政局，派別，系統，人事等各種問題，非常困難：這是無須諱言的。這個制度的實行，我認為是解决上述困難的最簡單，公正而有効的方法。同時還有許多別的好處，一併簡述如下：</p>
<p>第一　全國各大學的程度可以一致提高，現今各大學的程度相差極遠，尤其是文法科方面，缺少客觀的標準，最易腐敗敷衍，為人所詬病。敎部興其限制招生，不如舉行會考，因為前者戕賊學生的興趣和抹殺事實需要、而後者則是提高和齊一程度最好的方法。此制如實行，全國學生受試的題材都一致，各處大學立刻會發生三種直接的需求：㊀各大學的課程必須合乎專家委員會所擬定的標準，祇能多，不能少：同時敷衍，滑稽，湊學分，混鐘點的課程自然受淘汰，人事問題也隨之解決。㊁基木課程的內容必須充實，以應會考，如此則不僅學生，連老敎授都被逼着一起用功。㊂各大學必须把學系分清，新奇滑稽的學系自然裁撤，雜拌兒式的學系也不能不整頓清楚。</p>
<p>第二　大學行政與經費的經濟。如果實施此制，學生不得不求切實學問以應考，其他一切名義輿他全無益處。學校和學生都不得不力謀切實緊張，以求增加效率。不三不四的大學也自然受淘汰，可以省去社會上許多靡費。</p>
<p>第三　養成自由研究的風氣。此刻中國祇有中產以上的子弟才有求高深學術的機會，是一伴極不合理的事。不入大學的個人可以在公共圖書館中自由鑽研，可以憑著述而應學考試，是補救這種現象唯一可能的辦法。又如以前的大中學生在各處供職的，也可獎勵他們在業餘致力學問，以待應考。</p>
<p>第四　帮助解决社會的失業問題。現在大學生失業是社會上最嚴重的現象，許多祉會不安皆因此而起。並且問題不盡在失業，有許多大學生只能當書記，或當書記而猶不能稱職，於是怨恨社會不平。如果實行會考，使他們知道自己雖然是大學生，但比起全國的標準來應在什麼地位，則對於較低的職分也能敬業努力，不至於人人有懷才不遇之感，而增加社會的不安。同時真有才學的人，也可以得到公平的待遇，不至因派別系統的杆格而阻害人才的造就。</p>
<p>我在五年以前有一次和傅孟真先生討論改革高等敎育的問題，也曾説到這問題（獨立評論第十七期）。那時候我們期望這理想在三五年後也許能實現。此時敎育部如能開始籌備，我們希望今年暑假便可試辦。至於詳細的方案，自待精密的研究，這篇文字不過是一種建議。　　二十六年二月九日，武昌珞珈山旅次。</p>
<h3>英財相宣布籌巨欵充實國防</h3>
<p>五年內募債四萬萬鎊　定星期二發表白皮書　不啻對德國一種警告</p>
<p>［倫敦］財相張伯倫今日在下院答復工黨議員阿特里質問、聲明政府將於此後五年內舉債四萬萬鎊、以增強英國國防、據張伯倫所言、政府擬立卽向議會提出議案、增加資產或利用預算案中之剩餘、以作國防之需、所舉之債擬於三十年內、分期償還、張伯倫復宣稱、據以往一年中之經騐而言、吾人艱鉅工作之緊急性、並未為之稍减、吾人增强國防、以臻預定程度之負擔、亦未能為之稍輕、英國之國防費用增進極速、殊不能悉以歲收允之、現所需之數及分配之年限、一時尚未能加以預測、但債額之總數不至超過四萬萬鎊、其必需之財政决議、政府卽將以白皮書向議會提出、張伯倫復主張此項債欵之支用、應由國庫管理、而不由國防機關直接支用、而全部國防費用須由議會批准之、（中央社十一日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］准許財政部舉債或需用預算案羨餘以充國防經費、其數不得超過四萬萬鎊、而分五年籌之一案、昨夜由財相在下院宣布者、將儘速在國會提出、該案星期四日可在下院提出、俟各議員充分研究二月十六日政府所將發表之白皮書後、卽將開始辯論、白皮書將載明政府各部國防程序進行情形、大約尚將載有來年之某種方案、及説明政府當有權籌欵四萬萬鎊之急要、昨夜宣布之該案內容、為所募供國防用途之債欵、將付息三厘、至五年期滿後、得分三十年償還其本息、泰晤士報評論政府之建議、謂政府新債欵四萬萬鎊、無投諸市塲之問題、亦無立卽開募之象、該欵將分五年籌借、俟需用時、將由財政部發行所藉以巳經或將舉募公債之一種證券、新借欵並非以四萬萬鎊為其總數、不過以四萬萬鎊為其至高限度耳、欲𫑪此限度、須另訂新法制、就技術點而論、昨日財相所發表者、不過為創立一種富有能力的財政運用之機構、其細則將視日後環境之需要、而由國會訂定之、英政府實行國防程序之决心輿能力、藉此更足證明之、政府各部同時進行鞏固國防乏種種努力、於是益可有恃無恐、而全世界竭澤求魚、不惜浪費巨欵以擴張軍備之有害政策、或亦可因以知難而止、吾人於此、有厚望焉云云、（中央社十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］外交界人士今日感以德國駐英大使里寶特羅甫於財相張伯倫甫在下院宣佈募集國防公債計劃二十分鐘後、卽往訪代理外相海里發爵士、究係預先决定、抑屬巧合為問、官方否認兩者之間有何關係、但一般人相信此項姿態旨在警告德國、卽英國不久蔣為防禦力最充實之國家、財政當局估計、英國將在五年內以九萬萬鎊整頓武備、及維持戰鬥力云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>英擴軍計劃置重空防</h3>
<p>陸軍使機械化</p>
<p>［倫敦］負責人士頃宣稱、財相張伯倫昨日宣布政府行當發行國防公債四萬萬鎊之後、軍事上當有大規模革新辦法繼之而起、其詳細計畫，當於本月十六日用白皮書形式加以·公布、至其要點有如下述、㊀提高軍餉與獎勵金數額、藉使正規軍徵募之時、人民可以踴躍應募、又對於本部軍隊負有本部領土防空之責者則改良其訓練制度、㊁多數部隊將實行大規模機械化、按英國當局對於派遺軍隊前往歐洲大陸參加未來戰爭之念、暫時似巳加以放棄、而着重于本部防務之組織、並認為本部國防重在空軍、故其重整軍備之計畫、亦以空軍最為注重、觀於本年度計畫現在進行中者、規定添置飛機若干隊建造飛機塲若干處可為明證、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>柏林震動</h3>
<p>［柏林］英財相張伯倫昨在下院發表演説、宣佈發行國防公債四萬萬鎊之後、此間一般人咸大為震動、各報均在第一版刋載此項消息、并深以“英國在承平時代採取此種空前之擴充軍備政策為異、”但以為華盛頓海軍條約自去年年底滿期之後、英國在太平洋方面巳負有新責任、該國乃不得不擴充軍備云、德意志總匯報則歷舉大不列顚帝國政府最近在本國。直布羅陀·亞歷山大利亞·居伯羅島·新嘉坡·香港澳洲·紐西藺等地所建築之防禦工事、並引法國前陸軍參謀總長魏剛將軍之語曰、“大國為其政策上之需要、當置有強大之軍隊血後可、”今英國需此强大之軍備、究欲採取何種政策乎、查英國自去年十二月以來、巳與法國密切提携、兩國參謀部正在進行談話、此誠令人不能無疑、總之、英國此項决定、德國不負其責、至於美國報紙所載消息、謂英國官方畏懼德國與日本之威脅、尤甚於蘇聯之威脅、則尤不足徵信云、此外地方指導報則以為英國此項决定、益足證明德國整頓軍備之屬正當云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德國殖民地要求</h3>
<p>德使訪英外部説明理由　作為未來談判初步準備</p>
<p>［柏林］德國英大使里賓特羅甫將軍昨至英外部訪問代理外相哈立法克斯勳爵、聞與收回德國舊有殖民地事有關、德大便請英政府考慮、在原則上承認德國要求、英人士現視德大使此種行動、係趨向國社黨最大目的之第一正式步驟、其目的卽在承認一九一四年德國統治土地全行交還、衆意此項問題一時恐不易解决、又聞德大使並未提出任何備忘錄云、（中央社十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>談話內容一斑</h3>
<p>［倫敦］德國大使里本特洛浦本日午後四時、往外務部、訪謁代理外相哈里法克司勛爵、談話至六時十二分始興辭而出、渠於進見與辭出時、均行國祉黨式敬禮、關於談話內容、官塲方面僅謂、“二人所談問題甚多、當由里本特洛浦陳述德國政府之見解、”一般人以為、談話內容所由保守機密者、乃係里本特洛浦本人所要求、消息靈通方面則謂、里本特洛浦曾就德國關於殖民地問題所抱願望、説明理由、並將英國表示異議各點、逐項加以聲辯、但並未提出確切要求、大約當俟艾登外相假滿視事之後、始乃提出、蓋外間傳説哈里法克司勛爵態度，對於德國較為有利、德國擬利用哈里法克司以反對艾登、此在德國亟欲證明其非確聲、故一時不擬提出確切要求也、本日里本特洛浦首先説明德國是否置有殖民地、在經濟上言之、關係極為重大、次乃聲明德國茍在菲洲、置有殖民地、對於大不列顚帝國、决不致有何威脅、並稱、凡爾賽和約所載道德上各項論據、卽用以剝奪德國殖民地之論據、並無價值可言、聞哈里法克斯勛爵業已聞明、德國如欲在領土方面、牧回舊日殖民地、實屬無望、但在經濟方面、取獲若干權益、則可加以討論云、</p>
<p>此外里本特洛浦曾就德國外交政策有所説明、</p>
<p>㊀關於法俄兩國互助公約、里本特洛浦聲明、德國現仍表示異議、並謂該約兩簽字國保留指定侵略國之權此層卽與國聯會盟約第十六條互相抵觸、德國所由遲疑不願參加軍縮公約或天空公約者、其故亦卽在此、</p>
<p>㊁關於中歐洲問題、尤其是關於捷克·但澤自由市。米美爾自治區境內德國少數民族問題、里本特洛浦説明、此項少數民族倘能獲得一種地位、可使德國感覺滿意、並由德國監察此項制度之實施、則德國極願和平解决、而不擬藉此為啟發之口實、</p>
<p>㊂關於德國·四年經濟計劃問題、里本特洛浦説明、此項計劃並非德國在經濟上孤立之謂、其所注重、實在於原料品之取給、卽如煤油棉花橡皮之類均是、德國對於經濟上國際合作之議、並不反對、特各國所提出經濟合作之辦法、截至目前為止、非涉空泛之嫌、卽有重利貸欵之形式、自非德國所能接受、就德國觀察、各國現行進口稅率、倘能减低、則於經濟合作事業、卽大有裨補、特此層現尚難以實行耳、據一般人所知、本日談話時、哈里法克司勛爵發言不多、詰問之處尤少、而僅事聆取里本特洛浦之意見、並允轉達內閣閣僚、至於談話經過、可以一言蔽之、卽里本特洛浦説明德國見解、以為他日進行長時間之談判、作初步之準備是也、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法密切合作非德國所能離間</h3>
<p>［巴黎］關於德駐英大使里本特洛浦輿英國代理外相哈里法克斯進行談話情形、英國政府業巳通知法國政府，此間政府中人頃加以評論、以為英法兩國相互合作、對於以國聯會為基礎之國際和平事業、實大有裨益、德國外交政策倘在離間英法兩國、使之不復廣續合作、則决無成功之望、緣英法兩國政府原巳决定在採取何項决議之前、當相互諮詢也、政界人士并謂、英法兩國政府已共同决定賡續擴充軍備、此舉匪特足以保障各該國本國安全、卽對於中歐洲與東歐洲之現行疆界、亦係一種强固之保障、至開於德國要求恢復舊日殖民地一事、此間政界中人咸以為英法兩國決無在菲洲或其他地方、以任何殖民地割讓德國之意、例如參院外交委員會主席員朗熱、卽在經濟財政通訊報發表一文、略謂“德國在一九一四年所失敗者、若果期待於目前成功之、甚且不惜出之以武力、則各民治國定必武裝團結、以維護和平、一如歐戰時所為、此層德國必須明瞭之也”云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>預算削減二億餘元</h3>
<p>［東京］十二日在閣議席上决定之昭和十二年度預算、减去二億六千九百萬圓、較前內閣提出之三十億三千八百萬圓削减之下、成為二十七億六千九百萬元、兹將其內容分別列左、（以十萬圓為單位）皇室費四五、外務省三三○、內務省二、六一○、大藏省五、四五○、陸軍省七、○四○、海軍省六、五八○、司法省四二○、文部省一、四五○、農林省一、一五○、商工省二六○、遞信省二、○八○、拓務省二三○、合計二七、六九四、（十二日同盟社電）</p>

<p>［東京］此次修正之增稅案、計可增稅收總額約二億九千萬元、內容分別如左、國內國債約二億六千八百萬元、關稅一千八百萬元、輸出統制稅四百萬元、據上述情形觀之、則馬塲提案加以增收之關稅、其增收總額約達四億六千萬元、若與此相較、計已削减一億七千萬元矣、（十二日同盟電）</p>
<h3>杉山大將繼任陸相</h3>
<p>［東京］陸相中村孝太郞中將、因病辭職、並以寺內前陸相補敎育總監、陸軍方面因杉山就任陸相、認為適才適所、全陸軍均支持之、因陸軍推薦問題一時瀕於危殆之林內閣、對陸軍關係、因杉山陸相之就任大有變更、由此意義、陸相之更迭、可使林內閣與陸軍之關係倍加密接、其結果不啻對於林內閣施一補强工作、從其反面言之、陸軍之希望、可藉新陸相更加明瞭更加有力、林內閣之革新政策、將更因而推進焉、（十日同盟電）</p>
<h3>德戈培爾演説反共</h3>
<p>不容赤黨勢力西漸　認歐戰無爆發可能</p>
<p>［柏林］宣傳部戈培爾、本日在“德意志館”中、向國社黨員二萬人、發表重要政治演説、略稱、“吾人之敵、前曾妄稱、吾人一旦掌握政權之後、法國軍隊卽將再度開駐萊茵河區域、但此説卒未成為事實、余並敢謂、法國已不復作再度佔領魯爾鑛區之想矣、吾人秉政以來、已將軍備整飭完成、並將凡爾賽條約、撕成碎紙、擲於敵人之面、藉以證明其謬妄焉、”述及西班牙問題、謂“布爾希維克主義、欲在歐洲西部與西班牙遂其策略、此則决不為吾人所容許、”戈培爾嗣又叙述德國與日本曁巴爾幹各國之關係、并攻擊羅馬敎廷、謂“就余所知、西國伐崙西亞赤色政府、在敎廷駐有代表、而富蘭科將軍所主持之國民政府則無之、此層頗堪尋味、……彼基督敎會在反希爾希維克鬬爭中、果佔何地位乎、”嗣論及戰爭謠諑、謂“戰爭不致發生、希特勒元首、已向法國民族握手言歡、吾人對於法國亦並無領士上之要求也、”最後述及摩洛哥問題、則謂種種消息（指德國人在西屬摩洛哥活動之消息）均係莫斯科方面所發出、“而由巴黎各報予以傳播、吾人當卽加以反攻以證其偽、總之莫斯科方面、意欲促使歐洲墜入混亂之中、吾人自當有以阻止之、此吾人所可明白聲言者也”云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］關於西班牙海陸監察兩種計畫、葡政府均已拒絕接受、因此不干涉辦法調整會、目前惟有兩途可循、一卽承認監察制度無法實行、而予以放棄、一卽决定在西葡兩國領海以外之公海內實行監察、以免在萄國領土及領海內實施檢查、但第二種辦法、乃將西葡兩國等量齊觀、勢必遭遇種種阻碍而無法克服也、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>雙方爭通至新都大道　京南政府軍反攻獲勝</p>
<p>西班牙內戰、現已入第七個月、南部瑪拉加港本月八日被叛軍佔領、此港得失、軍略上極關重要、蓋叛軍佔有此港卽可破壞伐倫西亞及阿立坎德之運輸、而截斷政府軍自大西洋方面運來之接濟、同時本土與摩洛哥之聯絡亦可自由無阻</p>
<p>瑪德里　通伐倫西亞之大道、為首都之生命綫、雙方刻在距首都東南十二哩迭相攻擊、以爭此路之控制權、故西班牙內戰現已臻危急階段、戰鬥焦點刻在迦拉瑪河、雙方均以各種機械化之隊伍密集該河兩岸、西班牙政府堅稱、政府軍已克復俯瞰該路之諸小山、故該路雖尚未免除國民軍砲火之轟擊、然機關槍已不能及之矣、政府並承認是役雙方均受重創、此多由於各用機械化之戰術所致云、薩拉蒙加國民軍之司令部則稱、本週中瑪德里陣綫之國民軍曾埋葬敵屍一千八百具、又稱、國民軍騎隊現仍佔據伐倫西亞大道數哩、政府軍昨曾反攻、助以坦克車二十七輛、希圖阻止國民軍鞏固在迦拉瑪右岸所佔之陣地、卒為國民軍逐退、（中央社十三日路透電）</p>
<p>瑪德里　國防委員會本日發表公報稱、政府軍自二十四小時以來、卽在京南哈拉瑪河一帶、舉行反攻、業將叛軍所屬摩洛哥騎兵、與德國人所組成之機械化部隊、予以擊退、並在伐倫西亞大道附近之高地與巴哈萊斯山一帶、規復重要軍略地點多處、此外、京城東北瓜達拉約拉城前綫叛軍、頃亦猛烈進攻、當被政府軍迎頭擊敗、叛軍死傷達二百五十名之多云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>瑪德里　西國民軍雖聲稱、將作爭奪瑪德里之最後决戰、惟西政府軍現正將大舉反攻、以擊退向京畿進迫之國民軍、瑪德里守軍已要求總動員、並稱務勿使瑪拉加之失陷、喪餒政府軍之戰志云、政府軍謂現仍控制由瑪德里通伐倫西亞大道、惟車輛須繞道而行、因該路上曾受敵人砲火之威脅、當地村鎮之生活仍一如常態、婦女今日均安坐戶外、呼吸新鮮空氣、年輕女郞往來向井中取水時、均含笑無憂色、惟砲聲隆隆不絕於耳、與婦女之笑聲相參雜、該地生活之安靜可見一斑矣、（中央社十三日路透電）</p>

<h3>美造艦程序陷於停頓</h3>
<p>因鋼貨奇缺故</p>
<p>［華盛頓］今日探悉、新驅逐艦六艘、與新潛艇三艘之建造工程、佔美國本年造艦程序之半數者、現因鋼貨奇缺已告停頓、鋼之奇缺、乃由美政府與實業家發生爭執所致、聞銅鋼製造家因惠爾希喜來法律規定每週工作四十小時、又對應付政府需要之各工廠、訂有某種待遇勞工條例、故現已停止供給海軍部所需之鋼貨、藉以反對此律、當煉鋼廠每週工作四十八小時之際、所出之貨、猶不足應付需求、故均不允僅因供給政府定貨之故、而將每週工時减為四十小時、蓋政府定貨、較之私人方面所定者、為數殊微也、聞海軍部現至少需鋼二千五百萬鎊、惟各鋼廠現皆無承接政府定單之意、如海軍部造船廠承造三萬五千噸之戰艦一二艘、則需鋼之數將更巨也、（中央社十二日路透電）</p>

<h3>過去一年粵省社會經濟狀况</h3>
<p>通貨膨脹白銀漸次集中　百物騰貴人民購買力弱　各行商業大有今昔之感</p>
<p>廣州通信、粵省過去一年社會經濟與各行商業務、因社會金融之不靈活、與粵幣券陸續增發、白銀漸次集中官庫、物價隨之增高、不但米價突飛猛漲、卽凡一切日用物品、與夫油鹽薪炭、無不價格比尋常昂貴一倍有奇、其主因在於通貨膨脹、平日以白銀為本位之貨物、今則最低限度昂貴二成、蓋政府收買自銀以紙幣加二兌換白銀故也、是以平日值一元之貨品、現需一元二角始能購入、至於粵毫券與國幣（大洋）比價過高、（加一五比率、卽粵亳券一元五角、等於國幣一元、）亦為近來粵省生活程度提高之一因、以粵省仰給于隣省之貨物、採購俱以大洋為本位、今則大洋匯水高至加一五、此不但粵人感受國貨昂貴之痛苦、卽國內貸物入粵之銷途、亦受一大打擊、</p>
<p>過去一年、當局厲行收買白銀、城市方面、目下白銀經已絕迹、惟各縣鄉鎮因鄉人慣於儲蓄、藏鏹俱屬白銀、一時未易流出、當局為盡量吸收計、委托各鄉鎮郵務局代收、初時所收之數、仍屬寥寥、迨舊歷年關將屆、鄉人始盡以所儲白銀出賣、以資度歲、緣是各地郵局代收之白銀、驟見增多、同時亳券流通於鄉間亦充斥、物價抬高二成、賓趨勢使然、無足怪者、然物價旣貴、胼手胝足之農工、所得工資、並不見增加、一方酬庸依然如故、一方銷費突高、於是以勞力博衣食者、仰事俯蓄、均有未能、其困苦固難以形狀也、又因當局努力吸收白銀、需要亳券甚殷、故數月來省立銀行增發之新毫券、據所知者有一千四百萬元、月來仍有增發、聞係以之購買白銀之用、</p>
<p>各行商務、能獲利者不及十分之三四、工業廠出品、因原料價昂、製造出品、隨之價高、例如普通所穿之約襪、平日每雙不過二角、近月來價格漲至每雙二角半、因之銷途阻滯、至於針織之衣服、亦同此情形、而機製之上布、且因負擔出口稅興統稅、銷途更為銳减故過去一年、手工業多數折閱、近日全省鬧米荒、米價騰貴、中等階級、維持每天兩餐、尚覺困難、焉有餘財以供雜食、故往日盛極一時之茶樓酒館、多數營業不前、去年底大茶樓閉歇者計十餘家、巨大酒館收盤者亦不少、號稱大酒店之營業、亦勉强撐持、實際無利可獲、至米糠行因米貴影響、平日蔓存米石者、略有盈利、然米貴後、所購之米、輾轉損失、無大利可圖、至於歲杪照例生意旺盛之糖果業·海味業·臘肉業·紙料業·炮竹業·油荳業·衣帽業·鞋業等、年底生理、亦不及前年十分之五六、至推而至祇供有閒階級清玩之骨董業、更鮮人過問、人民購買力薄弱、大有每况愈下之勢、關心社會經濟狀况者、咸引為隱憂也、（二月十日）</p>
<h3>福州商場總結束之佳現象</h3>
<p>各商店均能清理賬款　錢莊摺款多数亦還清</p>
<p>福州通訊、本市商塲、門市店所售货物、除資本雄厚者、以現欵採辦可得特別廉價外、其餘多數則為分期收欵、自六十天以上、至一百天之期不等、行棧則視期之久暫、而於貨價上增加利息取償、每屆陰暦年底總結賬期間、須一概理還清楚、惟在總結賬前一月或兩月、行棧批發之貨則為過年盤、至陰曆二月二日、方收第一期之欵、在此期間、所售之貨欵、可資活動、為理還舊賬之需、所以陰曆二月二日、為商塲第一難關、而陰曆十二月二十五日、則為商塲最後難關、蓋此日為全年貨欵之總結算、約須還貸欵自分之九十、所餘百分之一十、則待二十八日還清、本月六日、為福州商塲最後難關、因去年茶木紙笋各種特產銷路甚佳、約比往年增加二分之一至三分之二不等、故市面金融、頗見活動、雖請求中央·中國·交通·三行貸欵五百萬元、救濟陰曆年關、未能成議、而各商家仍能如數理還、尚無倒閉事實發生至陰曆二十八日、（卽九日）乃找合錢尾、為數甚微、不至發生問題、至各商店所借錢莊之欵、雖須至總結賬期間清算、而資本雄厚者、一屆陰曆臘月、卽陸續入賬償還、最遲則於祀灶前後、過此卽為下戶、明年殘春、錢莊送摺則須考慮、並索保證、惟在以前錢莊繁盛時候、商店每多向甲莊做過年期票、以還乙莊摺欵向乙莊做過年期票、以還丙莊摺欵現在錢莊僅有數家、上述辦法、自難做到、如無救濟辦法、勢將演成倒閉、所以近年錢莊想出變通辦法、對鋪家如有金融停滯之困難、可將摺欵所欠之數、截成整數、改做期票、陰曆年底、僅須付出息金、待明春償還、惟去年各項出口貨、皆有起色、年關匯回貨欵、頗為可觀、各商家對於錢莊摺欵、多數皆已還清、其有因前年生意虧短艱於彌補及特殊情形者、亦允改做期票、以維現狀、而渡難關（二月七日）</p>

<p>總結賬各業豐收</p>
<p>本屆總結賬期結束，現在各商正在休息期中，大多尚未正式開市關於盈虧方面、又未統計、惟據各商之口談、對於收賬方面、因去秋收成大豐、城廂賬戶成績大佳、統共收入約在八九成左右、而鄉賬雖以秋成大熟、但農民連年積虧、一時尚無起色、幸鄉區賬戶甚少、無多影響、基上情形、則各業均有盈利、敢過廢曆初五之財神節、各商均將全體開市、</p>

<h3>本市各業總結帳形况好轉</h3>
<p>明日春假期滿照常開業</p>
<p>本市銀錢業及工商各業、於春假期內、循例休業四日、將於明日假滿開業、去年因農產之豐收、工商之昭蘇、故各業總結帳、安然渡過、金融情况、甚形好轉、為最近五年來所未有之局面、據銀行界發表二十三年來金融業之情况録後、</p>
<p>金融安定</p>
<p>我國自受世界不景氣潮流襲擊以來金融之恐慌、以二十三二十四兩年為最、二十三年度之總結帳期間、已有少數行莊、被迫停業、至二十四年度、則金融緊張之程度與日俱進、綜計全年內、本市停業之銀行凡十四家、資本總額凡二千七百餘萬元、停業之匯劃莊、凡九家、資本總額凡二百十餘萬元、因是政府不得不採行緊急救濟政策、於二十四年十一月四日、宣布改革幣制、施行新貨幣制度、金融恐慌、始漸弭平、當時物價雖受一時投機之興奮而激漲、終以各業實際尚未昭蘇而回平、故二十四年度之總結帳期、承歷年疲敝之餘、終因新貨幣制度而停止恐慌、拆息雖回鬆、而公債與外匯市塲、猶多謠諑、金融業喘息甫定、祇可謂為維持現狀時期、上年總結帳期、拆息鬆弛、外匯平穩、票據流通量增加、公債證券價格趨漲、斯可謂為金融安定之時期、</p>
<p>各業昭蘇</p>
<p>上年總結帳期間、金融安定之原因、為㊀金融業隨各業之昭蘇而進展、在國內因農產豐收、使農村經濟回蘇、故內地購買力加強、紗布等日用品銷廣而價漲、貨運加增、航業亦獲利、在國際上因世界經濟漸見恢復、國際物價趨高、故國內物價亦隨之高漲、尤以世界軍備競爭、國內之軍需原料、如銻·鎢·銅·錫·絲·及糧食等出口增加、價更騰貴、㊁金融業本身、以前不無因過度投資地產、致重資呆擱、或從事標金等投機、而遭受影響、自經風潮後、已改取穩健主義、緊縮信用放欵、注重抵押業務、而上年各銀行重要貸欵屬於經濟建設、如築路·電政·絲蠶·漁業·及農倉運銷等貸欵、總額在一萬萬元以上、此不獨鞏固金融業之基礎、抑且大有助於國民經濟之進展、其他如中樞政局之安定、政府維護力量之加强、雖一年中發生綏遠戰事、西南問題、以及西安事變等、而政府之政策不稍變更、對於國際匯兌、更竭力維持、得彌患於未形、使人心安定、金融穩固、實非偶然、如本年內益加努力、則其情况當更有進步云、</p>
<h3>廢曆除夕吳市長親巡視閭里</h3>
<p>十一日市府各機關照常辦公</p>
<p>我國商界習慣、向以廢曆年終為結帳之期、一般人民、亦以春節為及時行樂之會、本屆年關、因市面好轉、國事穩定、比較以往數年、漸呈回春向榮氣象、吳市長為觀察民情起見、於除夕驅車至本市各市區巡視一遍、目覩閭里安定、及人民預備慶祝春節情形之興高彩烈、深為欣慰、十一日為廢暦新年、政府機關、循例照常辦公、吳市長除親至市政府處理要公外、並至市府所屬重要各機關、視察一週、聞各機關人員均能照常盡力於職務云、</p>

<h3>中航公司報告</h3>
<p>二十五年度之成績　二十六年度之計劃</p>
<p>二十五年度中、中國航空公司一切發展計劃、不特完全實現、抑且超越乎期望、此一年來、乘客郵件包裹數字之增加、均已超過二十四年度、（二十四年度為本公司以前最高紀錄）董事會所採取購置最新式飛機之政策、顯然使乘客有更深之信心、上年度乘客里程、在二十四年度一倍以上卽其明證、當二十一年時、本公司航綫祇有一路其距離僅一六九一公里、此後逐漸發展、至二十五年度、共有航綫四路、計五二八零公里、又二十一年份、本公司飛機、實際飛行公里數、共六九四·一四三公里、至二十五年份、則增至二·四六六·四七七公里、就乘客里程計之、二十一年份祇一·二四七·八零八乘客公里、而二十五年份、則為一二·零零六·九四四乘客公里、乘客人數、於同時期內、亦目三·一五三人增至一八·五六七人、若自民國二十年公司創辦之日起、計至二十五年底止、所載乘客人數、共四六·三八三人、實際飛行里數、共八·九一七·九五零公里、所有乘客里程、共二五·一一零．零零三乘客公里、</p>
<p>我國民用航空、尚在幼稚時期、中航公司．深知其使命之所在、故踴躍以任前鋒、時在今日、地面運輪、已不足以應一般旅客之需要、於是迅捷舒適之航空運輸、乃為當務之急、蓋吾國幅員廣袤、尤以此項運輸為最宜也、</p>
<p>夫交通事業之最有開於我國之進步、盡人皆知之、而發展交通、則民用航空、尤不可忽、故欲膽我國之進步、僅一察航空事業卽可見其梗概、民國二十年十月二十日、中航公司洛甯機載乘客郵件、自上海龍華作處女航至漢口、計程八六四公里（五三九英里）飛行間為七小時、二十五年五月十二日、本公司道格拉斯巨型機一架、於一日之內、飛行三·九零一公里、（二四二三英里）停落九次之多、而飛行時間、不滿十三小時、計其飛行里數、較之七年前之處女航、幾及五倍、此可見在此期間、我國民用航空進展之狀况、又二十五年份、本公司乘客里程較諸二十四年份增加倍餘，此亦足證國人對於航空事業之興趣之日益濃厚也、</p>
<p>二十四年十月二十三日、本公司復以道格拉斯巨型機、開航滬蓉特班、計自滬至漢、三小時可達、而自滬至蓉一。九八一公里之航程、不及七小時、卽可到達、於是航空旅行之便利、遂益促國人之注意、該班飛機、每星期原定往返一次、自二十五年七月三日起、並改為每星期往返三次、</p>
<p>去年夏季、滬平綫道格拉斯巨型機、原定每星期往返四次、旋以乘客之擁擠、乃於六月九日起、改為當日來回、該綫飛行人員、於一日之中、完成二·六五四公里之航程、其工作之佳、亦有可稱許者也、滬粵綫、自二十五年九月一日起、每週亦作三次來回、於不及七小時之時間中、飛航一·六二三公里之航綫、同年十一月五日此綫並飛經香港、</p>
<p>二十五年二月十三日、由本公司與法國航空公司、簽立聯運合同、自廣州至河內、每週來回一次、於是歐亞兩洲間之直達飛航、與乎我國參與世界航空網之舉亦均實現、</p>
<p>同年十一月五日、滬粵綫機、首次停落香港、於是中航公司之航綫、又可啣接英國皇家航空公司之航綫、以達於歐洲、此本公司對於法國航空部長譚南·及英國當局香港總督嘉台閣爵士。所深致謝忱也、</p>
<p>當二十五年二月一日以前、國內航空郵件收費之辦法、係採航區制度、凡信件每二十格蘭姆每一千公里之距離、取費二角五分換言之、卽每一航區為二角五分、外加普通郵資五分、共計三角、如係兩航區、則取費五角五分、三航區則取費八角、四航區則取費一元零五分、嗣得郵政總局之協助並奉交通部之核准、自二十五年三月一日起、上述航區制度、一律取銷、一切國內航空信、悉收費二角五分、外加普通郵資五分、共為三角、此項航區制度取銷以後、本公司郵運收入、雖暫减少、而民衆則至歡迎、深信此後航空郵件之數量、必日益增加也、</p>
<p>本公司各綫自用道格拉斯巨型機飛航後、各處票價、逐漸減低、所減低價率、自百分之十至百分之五十、而去年乘客人數之銳增、亦足示中航公司董事會所採减低票價之舉、固至當也、</p>
<p>二十六年度發展計劃如下、二十六年夏季以前、有道格拉斯巨型機三架、可以運到、屆時滬蓉特班將自現行每週來回三次航班、增至每週來回五次、滬平快班、亦或可自每週來回三次、增至每週五次來回、</p>
<p>喧傳巳久之塞可斯水陸兩用機、現將於本年二月中到滬、該機可容乘客十八人、機師四人、每小時普通速度、可飛二七零公里、滬粵綫用該機飛行後、客運情形、必愈形改善、現行每週三次來回之航班、屆時當可增至來回四次、本公司經多次之試騐、現並於道格拉斯巨型機中、裝有尋向器二具、以維持飛航之準確、此後本公司巨型機上、均擬將裝置此項設備、</p>
<p>為求飛航術之完備起見、本公司將同時設立無綫電信標站十四處、信標站之地點、在滬蓉綫及渝筑綫上、為上海·南京．安慶·九江·漢口．宜昌·萬縣·重慶·成都·貴陽·等處、滬小綫上、為海州·青島·天津．北平·等處、滬粵綫上、則為溫州·福州·廈門·汕頭·廣州．等處．各信標站、旣經設立、各巨型機上再裝有尋向器、則本公司夜航設備、可與世界各國飛航設備之最完善者相媲美、而航行時刻、必可益臻準確矣、</p>
<p>本夏各巨型機到滬後、龍華機塲、將再建築一巨大之機棚以容之、此外並擬建乘客休憇室、以資候機者之用、又本公司於最短期間內、並將修築、極巨之滑板、以供塞可斯S—43新機之用、完成上列發展計劃、計需費約國幣三百萬元、</p>

<h3>蹦蹦戲女伶白玉霜不知何處去</h3>
<p>預定廢曆元旦登臺　稱往理髮一去不返</p>
<p>因出演妖媚戲劇而倖享盛名之蹦蹦戲女伶白玉霜、忽於本月六日（卽廢曆十二月二十五日（星期六）突告失踪、白之家屬、已登報尋訪、而最感失望、並蒙受直接損失者、當以法租界恩派亞戲院為尤甚、詳情探録於下、</p>
<p>原名李桂貞</p>
<p>查白玉霜原名李桂貞、北方產、現年二十有六、自幼從朱寶霞之父朱六學習蹦蹦戲、聞白於十六歲時、卽適天律某鉅商、育一女、卽小自玉霜是、但未幾卽下堂求去、仍操舊藝、出演於平津各埠、以妖媚著稱、其中尤以“潘金蓮”“槍斃小老媽”“馬寡婦開店”等諸劇、為其拿手好戲、</p>
<p>被迫後南來</p>
<p>平津為古都所在地、風俗淳厚、崇尚禮敎、致白之所演戲院、竟為平津當局認為攸關風化、迫令停演、乃不得已南下、另謀出路、詎蒞滬行裝甫卸、卽為法租界恩派亞大戲院所羅致、乃首次登臺、竟適合上海一部分人之口味、芳名於是大噪、</p>
<p>恩派亞改革</p>
<p>恩派亞戲院主人、鑒於白頗有希望、竟將原來之影戲塲、一變而為純粹之蹦蹦戲劇院、而自所演之“潘金蓮”一劇、曾一度續演至數星期之久、大有與巳往“狸貓換太子”“封神榜”等諸劇、得並駕齊驅之勢、京班名伶趙如泉氏亦曾一度與白合演斯劇、由此可見白藝術之一斑、</p>
<p>訂合同出走</p>
<p>白於去夏曾率班專往漢臯表演、秋末返滬、仍出演於得意地之恩派亞、至廢歷十一月終、白又往無錫出演兩旬、但同時仍繼續與恩派亞訂立新春元旦日登台之合同、自錫返滬、初不料至本月六日、（卽廢歷十二月二十五日）竟因家庭變故、悄然出走、</p>
<p>白養母登報</p>
<p>白出亡後、白之養母李卞氏、（北方人、年四十八歲、）初尚希望白於一兩日後、定可歸來、故對外間絕未聲張、直待除夕迫近、卽將登台、而白之影踪始終杳然、白母至此、始向恩派亞經理張偉濤説明前情、一面登報尋訪、（巳見報端）詞極懇摯、冀促其早日歸來、而恩派亞方面、大有哭笑不得之概、</p>
<p>胡為乎出走</p>
<p>白至之出走原因、外間傳説不一、有謂白最近與一李姓伶人、因戀愛問題、被乃母李卞氏所破壞、致生斯變、但據現住愷自邇路建安里一號之李卞氏所稱、初因家庭細故、於五日晚一度發生爭執、而白竟於六日上午、以理髮為由、一去不返云云、惟白之出走、究屬係何原因、實無加以探討及研究之價值、總之無論如何、終不外乎戀愛問題耳、</p>
<h3>縣烟毒總復查辦竣</h3>

<h3>婢女不願歸家願往濟良所</h3>
<p>婢稱迭遭主婦虐待　男婦拐匪還押再訊</p>
<p>靶子路五四八弄十五號南京婦人蔣吳氏家十四歲婢女姚金鳳、上月廿八日下午六時許、忽然失蹤、報告虹口捕房、派華探目王潤和調查之下、偵悉北浙江路一四八號開設薦頭店之常熟人俞財郎頗有關係、當將逮捕、詰悉其姘婦毛巧仙、無錫箱、卽前在蔣吳氏處寫傭、因故辭歇、懷恨乘隙將</p>
<p>姚女誘出</p>
<p>同赴崇明二區新鎮親戚施姓家藏匿、企圖販賣漁利、翌晨、俞犯解送第一特區法院、奉諭還押、改期中、由王探目持法院公函往崇明、按址將毛婦續獲、但姚女因該處風聲緊急、事前旣由人送滬、先在浙江路六五五號中國旅館、本月五日、着其自返蔣吳氏家、詎行經界路</p>
<p>迷途啼哭</p>
<p>經站崗華捕帶人匯司捕房、因女不肯説明被人誘拐情事、遂送濟良所暫留、而毛婦前日提滬、一昨由捕房連同姚女將俞財郎·毛巧仙·併送刑三庭、工部局律師張天蔭陳述前情、並稱據毛婦在捕房供．姚女出走事、洵係俞財郎唆使、是日她因尚有園巾一條、遺留在蔣吳氏家房中、藉詞往取適此時姚女為細故被氏責打、值斯機會、將其誘出、先至俞之薦頭店內</p>
<p>住宿一宵</p>
<p>繼往浙江路中國旅館逗留兩天、與毛婦商妥、由婦將女帶往崇明漁利、現女之東家蔣吳氏及父姚倍金咸到庭但女對於蔣吳氏姚倍金．兩處均不願返、精庭上裁斷、據女子金鳳稱、吾在蔣家為婢、約達兩年、初主婦待遇不惡、近若做事不慎、輙被毆打、當吾至蔣家時、由父同往身價六十元、並述明偕毛婦</p>
<p>出走經過</p>
<p>現願在濟良所讀書等詞據蔣吳氏稱、金鳳並非婢女、當時由其父作主在余家做事、六十元係其父貧苦之借欵、又據姚倍金稱、金鳳係吾之親生女、質之兩被告、互相狡賴、蕭變棻推事諭延期着濟良所將章程單呈閱再核、俞財郎·毛巧仙·還押、</p>

<h3>推翻一切預測上海埠際隊擊敗港隊</h3>
<p>滬隊攻勢極盛上半時連勝三球　總結果為四比三港隊表演失常　上海隊昨日又勝華聯隊</p>
<p>香港十三日專電滬足球隊十三下午在加路連由戰港華人聯隊、華聯因保存實力、以備十四日分區足球賽、是日僅調少壯名將出戰、參觀者之衆、不少於埠際賽之日滬隊四比一勝、該隊定十四日參觀華東華南分區賽、十五日戰港軍聯後、在香港酒店歡宴、十六日休息、十七日乘汽車環遊香島、十八日乘鐵行之拿路打拿輪返滬、</p>
<p>香港十一日路透電每年一度之滬港埠際足球賽、今日在此舉行、上海隊推翻一切預測、全隊用命、將港隊擊敗、結果四比三、</p>
<p>賽前、滬隊對此堅強之港隊皆以為罕有得勝機會、但滬隊之表演、優美異常、儘量利用所有可得之機會、其得勝為應有之結果、</p>
<p>福恩滬隊之右翼、射中四球中之二球、傑姆華特及勞巴司托夫各得其一、</p>
<p>香港方面、主將李惠堂射中一次、一次為十二碼球、威爾遜射中其他之一球、</p>
<p>比賽最後之數分鐘、充滿驚險、港隊竭其全力、猛烈反攻、希冀戰成平手、滬隊今日勝利之結果、又奪得失去之電報杯、雙方列陣如下、</p>
<p>勝第一球　港隊先開球、絲亳不能利用、上海進逼、其勢可畏、港方反攻、逼近球門、馬山兒一脚踢出、球盤旋來去、勞巴司托夫才獲得機會、將球送入網內、先開紀綠、</p>
<p>勝第二球　滬隊大為興奮、環攻港門不已、傑姆華特得其兄傑克之妙傳、將球射中橫木、彈下而入上海得二比零、</p>
<p>勝第三球　港隊經此挫折、稍露生氣、但因求勝心切、連連失去機會、上半時將結束前、福恩連人帶球、衝入網內、包家平欲救不及、</p>
<p>連負二球　港隊受此重創之刺激大為生動、下半時開始之第二分鐘、李惠堂卽以駿急之低球射入此球之後、威爾遜卽又繼之射中、是球先由楊水益猛射、球自滬隊後衛脚上彈回、威爾遜得之而中、</p>
<p>勝第四球　滬隊又見得勢、福恩得飽休脫之傳蔣球送入、滬隊又擴天成四比二之數、</p>
<p>負第三球　港方亡命反攻、在滬方球塲盤旋甚久、但終不得其鬥而入、不料在滬方球門、勃林蓋將李惠堂衝撞、李惠堂遂得中十二碼球、</p>
<p>保持優勝　在最後之數分鐘內、滬隊傾全力以保持此優勝之一球、李惠堂在離門前數碼處曾得一極好機會但竟射成野球、深為可惜、</p>
<h3>京業餘籃球隊在滬一勝二敗</h3>
<p>先勝辛隊連敗於信通　唐劉之技已遠不如前</p>
<p>前天津良華籃球隊之化身京市業餘籃球隊、於廢曆歲尾來滬、元旦日起、在滬連戰三塲、十一日首戰辛隊以六十比三十大勝、前晚次戰信通、以四十比四十四差四分失敗、昨晚再戰信通、又以二十八比四十八受挫、三戰情形、彙誌如次、該隊將於今日返京、</p>
<p>第一戰　業餘已不如昔日良華時代之精銳、守勝於攻、張尹兩後衛、堅若金湯、前鋒之中、李震中當然一支台柱、唐劉已不如昔、無良華時代之銳敏、後備軍亦太不如人意、但以對付辛隊、尚綽有餘裕、此戰在最初十分鐘內、辛隊、路佔先、陸鐘恩第三次犯規、辛隊受一重大束縛、業餘遂乘機大舉、二十二比十六時、陸四次犯規罰出、辛隊之大勢遂去、上半時辛隊以三十一比十九居先、下半時起、業餘之勢更盛、惟雙方之犯規更多、三十三比二十三、周達雲亦被罰出、四十比二十六時、唐實堃腿受傷出、最後一分鐘、李震中亦四次犯規出、轉瞬結束、業餘以六十比三十大勝、</p>
<p>第二戰　十二日晚第二戰、對信通、業餘於艱困苦門之中、下半時曾三度超出信通、結果仍以四十比四十四失敗、甚為可惜、上半時信通以十九比十六多三分、信通實力非常雄厚、除原有球員外、又加入麥令之洛克及美國明星籃球隊之後衛披合司、故業餘得此成績、洵非易事、此戰最初之十五分鐘、信通縱橫無敵、竟以十二比三、聲勢赫赫、至此業餘漸見起色、努力追趕、縮成十六比十八、上半時十六比十九、下半時起、變化莫測、唐劉李之空心籃、一再妙射中的、二十六比二十五第一次超出信通、張景實雖四次犯規罰出、業餘又以三十比二十八、第二度居信通之上、不料於三十四比二十九時、信通連得九分、信通又佔先着、但後衡披合司四次犯規罰出、劉孫諸人之努力、業餘以三十九比三十八、第三次居信通之上、惜乎最後之三分種內、洛克連連獲中、業餘遂以四十比四十四失敗、</p>
<p>第三戰　昨晚業餘再戰信通於申園、又以二十八日四十八大敗、上半時十五比十七落後二分、業餘連戰二宵、昨晚下半時、已露精疲力竭之態、遂不禦信通新銳之將、終於無法收拾、上半時業餘打來極度精彩頗有報復可能之象、會以十三比六居先、洛克萊茵漸漸追上、被其扳成平手、而以十五比十七信通多二分居前、下半時吳必顯替張景實人、李退居後衛、連失六分相去漸遠、二十二比三十一、孫惠培入代李震中、勢更不堪二十四比三十九、張景實四次犯規罰出、勝負巳成預定、四十四比二十四蘭茵雖亦被罰出、但已不能改變局勢、最後成二十八比四十八之比數、下半時中、信通之披合司卡遜諸人、勇猛可怕確係可畏之師、業餘陷入苦戰之中、體力之不同勞逸之各異、敗者非戰之罪也、</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>工商界面有喜色歡祝新春道發財</h3>
<p>為五年來稀有之現象　實際上尚有待於發展　五路日巧逢金危危　要發財仍須靠自力</p>
<p>去年一年，在上海各業為近五年來最為好轉之第一年，尤其為下半年，頓見欣欣向榮之象，去年市價之好轉，以油餅雜糧開其端，粉麥紗花繼其後，下半年布疋銷路一時稱盛，又使棉紗漲風銳不可當，連帶而棉織品各物無一不漲，加以津青烟臺各地，幾乎終年採辦潯稻等粳米，米價至出新而愈昂，豆麥芝蔴又無一不貴，據聞米麥雜糧油餅業除少數目光看錯而偶然失敗者外，無一不利市三倍，單就豆市街小小一段而論，行家獲利有兩百餘萬元之譜，其他各糧食行家以及閘北河下各米行尚不在內，卽此巳可概其馀，至於各銀行呆帳漸少，經營精明，獲利自可操券，卽如儲蓄分紅存欵，仍有八厘以上之利息，各銀行股息，又大都在舊結帳期前發放，足見銀根之寬裕，但自行法幣以來，各銀行已無自行發鈔時代之能予取予求，故利益之豐滿，當然以有發鈔權者為最優，棉紗業以去年紗價之步步上漲，獲利自無待言，紗布交易所優厚之股利，可為紗業獲利之明證，棉布業亦無不呼“應倒”，“賺倒”者，賺錢至不勝負擔而倒，非營業失敗而倒也，但疋頭漲後，曾有一度回跌，暗耗亦屬不輕，輪船業以北方米麵粉紗布等大宗採運不絕，下半年後粵局統一，洋米征稅，南運亦不弱，太古招商無論已，卽如政記等輪船公司，利亦有百萬，報關業之做北方生意者，連帶有利，卽有報糧食之小報關行亦利占大有，轉運業自浙贛鐵路通車，營業亦擴大不少，銀樓業雖金價平定，獲利匪易，然上海究係大碼頭，金價雖貴，購者仍不絕，工錢加昂，開支仍豐，況紋銀價每兩自一元五角加至一元七角五分。八成銀之銀器皿，每兩連工錢案價至兩元四角，少則兩元一二角，其中利息之優厚，亦非尋常可比，故能維持於不敝，金業交易所之營業，非民國二十四年之可比。起而代之者則為紗布雜糧麵紛諸交易所，無論其為股東所員，無不喜溢眉梢，雜糧交易所且撥十萬金造新市塲焉。證券交易所亦以統一公債上市之後，交易由絢爛而歸於平淡，然仍不失小康局面，絲茶兩業亦無一不佳，綢緞衣莊銷路尤旺，典當前年滿貨減價尚難印清，去年賣滿買加厘頭，猶爾搶我奪，洋紙業遭際尤佳，上半年定貨，下半年卽大得利，且多無貨應市，非躉售儘有據頭不顧，故紙業在此一年中莫不以上年定貨太少為恨，此外如門市日用商店固為物價上漲而有沾潤，究以一般購買力未恢復，失業問題未解决，故未能作健全之進展也。惟去年年底，各客棧旅館都告客滿，不若前年七折八扣住一天送一天之無人顧問，此可為商業有利之徵象，蓋商人往往於歲尾年初，借旅館為行樂之地，間亦招攬客商拉攏生意，故今年工商界相逢道賀“恭喜發財”，滿臉多愉快之色，不若前年口儘如是説，面仍不無躊躇狀也。</p>
<p>總之去年上山勢之市面，買進者無不獲利，拋賣者難免失機，實則市面好轉，得力於國外者，為世界軍需工業之景氣，國防設備之精進，以原料供給世界之中國，不無得沾馀瀝，二則國內連年荒歉，去年豐收，而又值原料海外需要殷切，加以鄉農久經疲困，急須添補，因之一時的需要激增，二則從門市營業以為觀察，真正之購買力尚未復原，故物價之上漲，似以得力於貨幣貶值之功為多。至於今年之工商業，承往年方張之氣，若無意外來襲，獲利自可操券。市塲中儘有一種傳言，以為今年五路日，適逢“金危危”古諺相沿，“金危危”請財神，大利，而俗例本於舊正初四之夜請財神，初五日開市，今年適逢“金危危”於是商人中儘有以“財神今年在中國”為新年相賀祝道之資料，（按金危危今年有兩日，一為舊曆正月初五日，一為四月二十九日）而以自博一粲者，説涉迷信，原無足取，要知中國工商業至此地步，决非倖運可以解决發財問題，如果真要發財，須要拿出真實本領，全副精神；出而與人周旋，不但物質要改進，精神亦要改造，否則卽使有“財神”，亦愛莫能助也。</p>
<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>棉紗轉機　全靠一冬</p>
<p>現紗二十五年實銷、較上年為起色、但上半年各方購買力依為不振、各廠生產仍有過剩之慮、金融界雖有一度在標紗市塲搜羅、市價上漲、但實需始終無發展之象、故市况不久復告下游、嗣至秋季、因全國棉稻豐稔、布疋首先活動、布銷既暢、紗綫為必需之原料、隨之起色、至於紗廠方面、在七八月中、因棉花在青黃不接之際、某方面操縱尤力、市價高抬至五十二元半、棉花之漲風、超過紗布、紗廠之停車減工、增進不巳、且有一部完全關閉、漢口亦遭同此病症、華北天津五十萬紗綫錠竟被日商購去矣、生產量大減特減上海存紗漸漸減少、由八萬包縮至二·三·萬包、於此秋銷發動、各廠苦無現紗供給、交易所倉庫中之存紗、遂為客幫競購之目的物、未幾三萬包存紗、掃數售罄、是見各幫進量之宏也、市塲幾成無紗可購之勢、乃進一步、而購買期貨、申新．永安等廠拋售愈夥、生產不敷需求、紗號求現心切、祇得向廠爭先墊銀分派棧軍、十月以後、紗價漲勢愈見劇烈、由二百三十元至四十元、直達至五十元外客方墊就棧單貨有之現象、益足證現銷之暢健也、遂使市塲紗價、現貨及棧單之價、每件相差一、二十元之鉅、實則紗業凋弊五年、農村連年衰落、諸方存布存紗、愈形枯竭、廿四年春季存紗、最高紀錄達十六萬包外、後以國府改革幣制政策公佈後、金融穩定、今得全國豐收之惠澤、農村購買力富健、數年惜澹之市象突然回蘇矣、查全年各帮買去現紗統計三十六萬三千二百五十包、比上年之三十萬○三千九百五十一包、增加五萬六千二百九十九包、其中內地帮採辦獨旺、以布疋交易暢旺、兩粵軍事統一、南部一隅需求布疋、進胃奇濃、故錫常澄一帶小布廠、獲利甚豐、全年買去現紗有十一萬五千八百十三包、比上年增一倍以上、江四帮進五萬一千○六十包、增二萬八千九百十包、天津帮進三萬六千○四十五包、增二萬三千九百二十包、惟廣東帮進六萬○七百九十三包、减一萬五千一百二十五包、查一月份成交二萬二千一百三十包、二月份成交三萬五千六百三十四包、三月份成三萬二千五百三十一包、四月份成交一萬九千三百十二包、五月份成交二萬二千六百三十五包、六月份成交二萬六千一百七十包、七月份成交一萬九千六百三十包、八月份成交四萬四千八百三十一包、九月份成交四萬七千六百四十二包、十月份成交四萬一千○○五包、十一月份成交三萬二千二百二十五包、十二月份成交十八萬五千五百包、合計三十六萬三千二百五十包、兹將各帮口全年及上年買去之量額列表如下（單位包）</p>
<p>標準棉紗市塲、在春秋兩季、市價徘徊在二百元關口、嗣至五月間中美貨幣協定公佈後、跌破二百元關門、至一百九十三元、此時倉庫仔紗常在三萬包間、紗市壓力重重、繼以國內日僑被殺事件、引起外交、日趨嚴重化、市塲又現不安之狀、兼之今庚全國棉田激增生產又告豐稔、八月八日美棉估計發表、亦較預料數字為高中外原料顯有供過於求之勢、美棉下落、紗市愈受壓迫、但十月以後因農村好轉、四方布疋交易活耀、棉紗原料銷路突飛孟晉、市價步趨高翔、有二度漲停板、漲風之銳、為十餘年內所未見也、新高峯層見疊出、同時大阪三品紗亦創三百元頂高峯、十一月五日再創二百六十八元、為民國七年以來之新紀錄、同時二十支現紗、一日間飛騰十五六元、綫跳二十元外、價格竟登峰造極、交易所營業、大為發展、成交數量超過上年一倍半、兹將標紗全年各月期最高低價既總成交數交割價交割數製表列左、以資參考、</p>

<h3>用什麽態度來讀書？</h3>
<p>— 年康</p>
<p>學三種小動物生活的精神</p>
<p>小朋友們，平時你們抱什麽態度讀書的？這裏把三種小動物生活裏所特具的精神，給你們一個讀書態度的啟示和參考：</p>
<p>（一）蟻覓食：螞蟻覓食的精神，簡直是任勞任怨，無遠勿屆的。它的身體雖小，氣力却很大；它們求生的信念很堅强，寗願爲羣衆而犧牲個人，不願放棄了原定的目標。它們的生活是用刻苦戰勝困難的。讀書的態度，應該學蟻覓食的精神，去搜集材料，去下决心，去刻苦努力！</p>
<p>（二）蠶吐絲：「春蠶到死絲方盡」，這是蠶爲吐絲而犧牲自己的一種精神。讀書的態度要「專一」，要「澈底」，要作深刻的研究，埋頭努力；更有一點：蠶吐絲雖多，而很有系統和頭緒，尋到絲頭便可引長開來，所以讀書態度該有整理材料的能力！</p>
<p>（三）蜂釀蜜：蜜蜂釀蜜是一種儲備食料的動作，在冬天的氣候和環境中，它們不能得食料，于是很早就勤于採花釀蜜的工作。讀書也該從早努力，多求得智識，準備需要時應用；而且蜜蜂採花是取精華而去渣滓的，讀書也得本着這種態度，要有判别力量，辨别是非！</p>
<h3>工商裏的煙囱為甚麼造得格外高</h3>
<p>— 江蔓</p>
<p>下午四時後，王先生因事進城，順便領我們到民生工廠參觀。</p>
<p>還沒有到民生工廠，工廠的那個高高的烟囱，却早已映進了我們的眼簾。我們曾經參觀過不少工廠了，記得他們的烟囱，都是高得非凡，就是最低的，也有好幾丈高。這倒底是甚麼道理呢？我問王先生。</p>
<p>“你問得很對！”王先生道，“看你們中間，有誰能回答不能？”</p>
<p>楊百川答道：“我想，烟囪高，煤炭便容易燒得着；煤炭容易燒得着，就可以節省煤炭。不知對不對？”</p>
<p>王先生立刻笑容滿面，道：“不錯！不錯！節省煤炭，這是一點，還有嗎？”</p>
<p>楊百川繼續思索下去，我們也默默地，想着。但是總想不出。過了好一會，王先生道“還有一個原因，讓我説給你們聽：燒煤的時候，烟囪裹一定有一種炭屑，黑烟，跟臭不可當的煤氣噴出來。這些東西，對于我們的身體，有極大的害處。這時，他們如果有很高的煙囪，那些黑烟，煤屑，臭氣，會在很高的地方，給風吹散去；不然的話，如果他們的烟囪太低，他們自己，煤用得不經濟，倒還是小事，但是附近居民，却要大受其害了。這不是一樁極危險的事嗎？”</p>
<p>“是！是！”我們一面用心地聽着，一面慢慢地踱着，不知不覺已到了工廠的門口了。</p>
<h3>鯽</h3>
<p>— 仲美</p>
<p>今天下午，小敏的姑母從鄉下出來，去拜訪小敏的母親，並且帶上來數尾鯽魚，是送給小敏吃的，所以他很高興，等在廚房裏看母親怎樣炊法，當炊起的時候，小敏問母親道：“母親，鯽魚的肚子裹面，有什麼東西。”</p>
<p>“鯽魚的肚子裹面有五種構造的東西：一、循環器和呼吸器，循環器是極簡單的，由一心耳和一心室組成。呼吸器是用鰓，口和鰓孔是可以互相開關。二、消化器：牙齒生於口腔內的上下頰，食道很細而且短，下面連胃，更次為腸，在腸的迴繞的地方有膽囊，肝臟和脾臟，胸腹背側有一個鰾，因為中央稍狹分前和後兩部分，通接食道。三、排泄器和生殖器，排泄器有腎臟二個。生殖器：雄的有睪丸二個，雌的有卵巢二個。四、神經系；嗅覺很銳敏，眼睛沒有眼瞼，耳朶有內耳，腦子不發達，中腦比大腦大。五、骨骼和筋肉：骨骼都是硬骨，頭骨的構造比較更複雜一點。筋肉：和別種動物不同，由許多曲尺形狀的筋節組成，附在脊柱左右，能隨意伸屈運動。”</p>
<p>“那鯽麼魚的鰭有那幾種呢？有什麼功用。”</p>
<p>“在胴部的前端兩側，稱為胸鰭；在後端的稱腹鰭它們的功用是能够在游泳時變換方向，慢慢的撥水前進，在背脊上面有脊鰭，在肛門後面有臀鰭，它們的功用是能够保持身體的平穩正直。在尾的，呌做尾鰭，它的功用也是變換方向的。”</p>
<p>“那麼鯽魚除了給我們吃，還有什麼功用呢？”</p>
<p>它們的骨頭和鱗，能做成魚的肥料和魚膠，在農業和工業方面都很有用處。”</p>

<p>有一座很高的山岩上，住着很多的獅子，山的腳下卻住着許多蚂蟻。有一天蟻王因為山脚下的食料很缺乏，所以召集了許多螞蟻開會，蟻王做主席，向它們説明了開會的原因，於是許多螞蟻都紛紛議論，但仍沒有相當的辦法。</p>
<p>正在議論的當兒，蟻王忽然看見獅王在山頂上散步，蟻王便對獅王説道：“我們因為山脚下的食料很缺乏，所以请你每天须送一頭獅子下來，你倘使不允許的話，那末我們就要把山上所有的獅子一起殺死。”獅王聽了它的話，就冷笑了一笑回答道：“你們這種弱小的東西也想吃我們強大的獅子嗎？真是夢想了。”獅王説完了就頭也不回的去了。</p>
<p>蟻王就命許許多多的螞蟻把這座山脚蛀穿。螞蟻們都很努力的把這座山脚開始蛀起來，果然不到數天，山脚已經搖動，在許多獅子熟睡的當兒？山岩就轟隆一聲的坍倒了，許多的獅子也都死於非命，它們從此不再缺乏食料了。</p>
<p>這雖是個童話，但是由此可知，團結可以克服一切橫暴，努力可以戰勝一切艱難。</p>
<h3>蜜蜂和蝴蝶</h3>
<p>— 朱承煕</p>
<p>蜜蜂嗡嗡叫，</p>
<p>唱的快樂曲調，</p>
<p>“春夏做工勸勞，</p>
<p>製造蜜糖不少，</p>
<p>不用憂慮煩惱，</p>
<p>秋冬依然溫飽。”</p>
<p>蝴蝶急急飛，</p>
<p>愁的忍寒耐飢，</p>

<p>如今衣食無依，</p>
<p>想起好不慘悽？”</p>
<h3>不怕死的孩子</h3>
<p>— 陸仲宏</p>
<p>這個故事，是在普法戰爭歷史上，佔着最有光榮的一頁，除了少數小朋友，已經知道外；大多數的小朋友，恐怕卽是聽過，也巳經放進腦後，模糊不清了吧！現在不嫌重贅地再寫出來，供給我們國難期間的小朋友，作一個良好的參考。</p>
<p>普法戰爭時，法軍敗退到一個小鎮上，這小鎮是有死守的必要，因為鎮後橫亙着一座蒼鬱的森林，在鎮上望不見敵軍的動靜，於是法將領央求一個不曾逃走的孩子，指着鎮上的一株大樹説道：</p>
<p>“你能不能爬上這株大樹？看看後面森林裹有沒有敵人的踪跡？”</p>
<p>“那有甚麼不能，我常常上樹的。”</p>
<p>這孩子説完，就爬上樹去，坐在粗枝上瞭望着，將領説：</p>
<p>“你看見什麼呢？”</p>
<p>“看見的，有一面普魯士旗，鹽盪在樹林中。”</p>
<p>“還看見什麼？”</p>
<p>“慢些，讓我再爬上一點，——喔唷，……有許多普魯士兵”。</p>
<p>這時突然“砰”的一聲，從森林裹打出一顆槍彈，法軍都驚駭着，但將領還鎮靜的對那孩子説：</p>
<p>“下來吧！好孩子，他們看見你了，很危險。”</p>
<p>“不要緊，我躱在樹葉裹，他們打不中我。”</p>
<p>“那麼他們現在有什麼行動呢？”</p>
<p>這孩子不答話，竭力往樹上爬，一搖一擺偵察着，雖然敵軍的槍彈，繼續的向他射擊，將領竭力阻止他，他毫不畏懼，畢竟把他所探得的情形報告道：</p>
<p>“他們全體動作了，背槍了，——呀，又分成兩隊了，一隊朝東，一隊朝西，——呀，他們又沿着小河兩邊，向我們這邊跑呢。”</p>
<p>“够了，够了，勇敢的孩子，快下來，危險哪，我們也要動作了。”</p>
<p>這孩子還想往高處爬，但槍彈一陣一陣的射來，起初他的小腿上，中了一顆彈子，後來腹部也給槍彈射穿了，他才兩手一鬆，像受傷的鳥兒般直落下來，他的熱血滔滔的直流，臉上轉變了顏色，但他還牽動着小口呶呶的説道：</p>
<p>“不要緊的，我為的是我們的法蘭西。”</p>
<p>那將領忙着調派軍隊，也無睱理會他，他的血流得過多了，苦痛的躺在地上，眉頭鎖着，眼睛無力的張着，小嘴顫動着，好像焦急的，還在等待甚麼。等到從法軍殲滅普軍凱旋回來，那“法蘭西萬歲”的歡呼，夾着“勇敢的孩子，精神不死”的震喊，傳到他的耳中時，只看見那將領肅立在他的前面，告訴他説道：“可敬的孩子，祝福你超昇天堂，我們是完全打勝了”，話畢在那小孩死灰色的臉上，現出一絲滿意的微笑，很恬靜的裹着國旗長眠着。</p>
<h3>對流</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>在星期日的那天，敏兒要求着他的哥哥，去參觀工廠，因為他是從沒有到過工廠裹去參觀過，而他的哥哥為要使他多得一些智識，便也欣然的答應了他的請求。當他們走了不多一會，敏兒便遠遠的望見了好多根高大的煙囪，他知道那煙囪是工廠裹的，但他把自己家裹的煙囪來一比，更顯出它的高大，這倒使他發生問題了。</p>
<p>“哥哥，他們不是傻的嗎？造了這麼高大的煙囪，有什麼用呢？一旦被大風吹倒了，怎麼辦？你瞧，我家裹的煙囪又低又矮，任風怎麼大，誰也吹不倒它？”</p>
<p>“你又胡鬧了，工廠中的一切設備，都是和工廠本身有利益的那麼煙囪造得這麼高，當然也不能例外的，但他們把它造得這麼高，到庭有什麼利益？原來是使空氣有一種對流作用，這可使爐子能繼續不斷的有新鮮空氣供給，於是可以燃燒得旺盛了，你要知道燃燒是最需要新鮮空氣，因為新鮮空氣是多氧氣的，氧氣便可幫助燃燒，省燃料，又可以便爐子裹的火很旺盛。</p>
<p>“什麼叫做對流作用？有什麼證明？”</p>
<p>“我們從前曾做過一個對流作用的實驗，我倒可以告訴你：我們先拿了一隻玻璃瓶，瓶中盛了一半的水，再放了幾粒洋紅，然後放在燈上燒，便可以看見紅色從瓶底的中央上升，向瓶的旁側落下去，這樣幾次上下，全瓶的水都變成紅色，這因為瓶底的水，受到了熱，便上升，瓶側的水比較不熱，因之下落，所以又把上面紅色的水帶了下來，於是這樣循環不息，最後全瓶的水便都變成紅色，同時全瓶的水也熱了，這便可以得一個結論，熱跟了水上下循環的現象叫對流作用，但不只是限於水，其他的東西也可以的。”聰兒説到這裹，更繼續的説下去：“我倒要問你：我家裹的那隻冰箱，為什麼在夏天的時候，把冰放在箱的上部？這也是對流作用的個很好的例子，把冰放在冰箱的上部，便使冰四周的空氣也冷了，空氣一冷，便向下下降去，但箱底的空氣是很熱的，因為是在炎熱的夏天便隨之上升，這樣的一上一下，不多時候，這冰箱裹便充滿了寒冷的空氣，食物也可免得受熱而腐敗了。”</p>
<p>他們到了工廠門前，便停止了討論，到裹面去參觀了。</p>
<h3>牛年話牛（附圖）</h3>
<p>— 董遜</p>
<p>今年是牛年，就拿牠來做一個標題，我們來談談吧！牛這樣動物，在家畜中是一種很重要的牲畜。世界上所產的牛的總數約有五億一千萬餘頭之多，約合世上人口總數的三分之一強“世界總人口約十八億左右）。在這麼多的牛中，依其用途，大別之可分為乳用種，肉用種，役用種三大類。</p>
<p>乳用牛中著名的有：一·荷蘭種（Holstein）㊀此牛原產於荷蘭本土，後經美國改良，除乳用種尚有乳肉兼用種一種，其毛色背部有黑色斑塊，腹部，尾端以及四肢，都是白色的，牠的乳量和體重都要超過其他各種牛，所以世界各地多有飼育之。二·阿寫種（Ayshire)㊂此牛原產於英國阿寫州毛色白地而帶黃褐色的斑點，兩角高聳。其乳適於製造乾酪之用。三·全適種（Jersey）此牛原產許英法海峽中的，全適島上，毛色灰褐或黑褐，鼻鐿白色。其乳適於製造奶油。四·高隆西種（Guernscy）此牛產於英法海峽中的高隆西島，體形和全適種相似，毛色淡黃而帶褐，赭，白諸色斑點。其乳質非常濃厚！</p>
<p>肉用牛以短角種（Shorthorn)㊃為最著名，此牛原產於英國，原係乳肉兼用種所配成者，其形龐肥如豬，牛角甚短，雄牛體重自一，二○○公斤至一，四○○公斤，毛色灰白而稍有赤褐色之刺毛。肉味甚佳。其他如英國之海來福特種（Hernford）體重自八○○公斤至一千公斤，阿白敦盎格斯種（Aberdeen-apgus)體重自六○○公斤至九○○公斤，加羅會種（Galloway）體重八百公斤左右。均為世界有名之肉用牛。</p>
<p>役用牛有一·黃牛㊅此牛原產於我國及亞洲各種，一般均用以耕作或挽車。二·水牛，水牛分印度水牛㊇及美洲水牛㊆兩種，美洲水牛多野生，有赤，黑二種；印度水牛亦有．種，一種是野生，馬來，半島產之，一種是馴飼的，我國，印度，台灣，馬來以及亞洲各地都有，這種水牛毛色灰黑，或黑色，頭部生有很長的角（約有一米）肉質很劣。可是力氣很強，用以耕田，荷物，非常適合，因為牠很喜到河中去洗浴，所以就名之為水牛！三，氂牛是我國西藏高原的特產，用以載物，操作，力氣非常的强大！四，褐瑞士種（BrownSwiss)㊁此牛原產於瑞士的東北部氣候寒冷的地方，體格很強健，適合嚴寒山地地帶的飼育，其毛色棕褐，為瑞士山地之役用牛種，五，彈伏種（Devon）㊄這是世界最早的改良種牛，原產於英國，全身赤赭色，毛質光軟，其性玲琍活潑，適於農耕操作，其肉質亦佳，乳質亦多，並且因為牠的力氣大，所以在西班牙便用作鬥牛之用。</p>
<h3>假使你的衣服着了火</h3>
<p>— 瓊白</p>
<p>小朋友們，假使你的衣服着了火，你將怎麼把它熄滅？這裹我介紹給你們。幾點很當便的方法：</p>
<p>㊀要鎮靜。衣服既已着火，慌是無濟於事的，要設法把它熄滅才是正當的辦法。切勿亂跑亂跳，因為這樣一來，反而使火勢熾盛。</p>
<p>㊁火燄終是向上的，所以衣服着火時，面部，頭髮處在最危險的地位。應當立刻倒臥地上，使面部和頭髮不致受傷，一方面在地上打滾，使火燄熄減。</p>
<p>㊂我們知道燃燒是需要氧氣的，所以也可利用這原理把火熄減。趕快拿一條單被，羢毯或相類的東西，緊緊裹住身體，使與空氣隔絕，火熖因為沒有氧氣的供給，也就熄滅。裹的時候要從頭頸向下裹去，否則從下面裹上來，結果火燄會向上一竄，把你的眉毛，頭髮和面孔灼傷。</p>

<h3>雞鬬</h3>
<p>— 知本小學五年級生　謝嘉盛</p>
<p>今天早上，我起來的時候，盥洗後，就在家裹看書。忽聽得外面有人喊道：“看那個兇！看那個兇”！我走出一看，哦！原來是東鄰的一隻公雞，和我家的一隻公雞相鬥。起初時，東鄰的雞愈鬥愈勇，我家的雞處處讓步。後來那東鄰的雞，得寸進尺，心不知足，我家的雞知道要求生存，祇有振作精神，抱定“你死我活”的决心，去和牠决戰，畢竟東鄰雞敗，我家雞勝了。我看了一回，便回家寫字。</p>
<p>後來，那隻東鄰的雞，再也不敢來侵略了。</p>
<h3>義（四）</h3>
<p>— 青</p>
<p>一千八百二十六年八月，就在這一帶海面上有一艘縱帆式的小帆船“喜鵲”號，在駛行着，由一位青年大副愛德華史密斯指揮一切，搜索一艘海盜的船隻，它橫行在古巴島的西海岸，已有很久的時間了。這一天天氣非常悶熱，在向晚的時光“喜鵲”號，停泊在可洛拉度岩石的附近，八點鐘時西方起了一陣微風，船帆已張了開來，但是不到一小時，風又轉向南方，在月光下可以瞧見一小股灰黃的烟氣。這是一種危險行將襲來的預兆，凡是航海的人全都知道的。於是史密斯大副立刻趕到甲板上，下令將船帆捲起，預備向那風濤作誓死的抵抗。</p>
<p>那雲很快的加多起來，在數秒鐘內，四面寂靜無聲，一會兒却來了陣衝鋒似的怒吼的聲音，先還遠遠的，但是在一瞬之間，越近越響起來。海面上本來是很平靜的像一片湖，這時却有一堵黑色的墻壁猛推過來，沖擊成一大抹白泡沫，像雪花似的飛將起來，就在這當兒已打到了他們的船上！在怒濤洶湧聲中，大副吶喊着快快截去桅子，可是那裹來得及，他們的船早巳側在一邊，不過是一眨眼的功夫，巳整個兒的沉下去了！有一個名喚梅爾德勒的二副，在電光掠過時瞧見他的伙伴們都在水中掙扎着，他就向船沉上面的急流中游泳過去，伸手抓住了一根槳，接着又抓住了第二根。那颶風既完成了它的工作，一路吹了開去。海面上便又平靜下來，剛綫的與波作浪倒像做了一個夢一樣。</p>
<p>梅爾德勒迸住了呼吸，靜聽着近邊有沒有伙伴們的聲息，不多一會，他就吐了一口氣，原來聽得有一個聲音，在問着甚麼人在這裹，原來這正是那大副史密斯和六個伙伴，抓住了一隻浮起的救生船，其他的水手們一見之下，都快樂得什麼似的，都衝了上去，于是不多一會，就有二十四個人都吊在這船身上了，有幾個更躺在船的籠骨上，因此這救生船完全失了它的效用，只是浮在水面上罷了。</p>
<p>大副史密斯命令他們，一起放手，好讓那船調正它的地位，他們服從命令，都把手放了。於是史密斯派兩人跳到船中，將他們的帽子，潑去船中的水，更喚其餘的人繞着船的上緣吊在那裹，好使船身減輕重量，然後大家都可上船。不料正在潑水的當兒，忽有一個水手放聲大喊，説是瞧見了一條沙魚的鰭，一時大家都慌亂起來，深怕飽了魚腹，于是一窩蜂的都擠到船中去；可是用力過猛，又把那船打翻了，那大副又很堅决的命令他們回到水中，重把船身調正了，一面喚他們在水中用力揮動他們的腿，好使那沙魚不敢近身。那時一切都還順利，船中巳可以搭四個人了。天明以後，希望尤其濃厚，但是到了十點鐘左右，又有人高喊着：“沙魚！沙魚！”他們瞧去不但是一尾，竟足足有十四五尾之多，當下便起，更大的慌亂，又把那船打翻了。大副史密斯卽忙放出鎮定而堅决的聲音，喝住了那些水手，仍派兩人上船，其他的人仍然吊在外面，那些沙魚先還好像作耍似的游近過來，摩擦着水手們的身體有的竟在船面上游過。末後却有一人大喊了一聲痛，原來他的腿巳被一尾沙魚咬住，那魚一嚐了血的味兒，那人再也沒有希望了。史密斯把住了船尾，極力鎮壓水手們不要慌亂，一面鼓勵船中人趕快潑水，一面安慰旁的人耐心兒等着，大家好上船脫險。</p>

<h3>六日中</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>本刊循例於寒假休刊六天，六天轉眼已經過去，今天又是第七天了，服例又要和讀者天天相見，這原是一件很有趣味的事，但是今天在舊暦的新年中，還是和讀者第一次見面，將拿些什麼話來和諸君談談呢？國事呢？國人所最注意的事，便是陝西事件，現在西安的事變，業巳全部解決，這一件事固可報告於國人，但這事在六日之前，已有全部解決的趨勢，則新聞也可説是舊開，巳沒有什麼價值，此外除明日三中全會行將開幕外，并無其他新奇可喜的事可以奉告，國際間事呢？日在變幻莫測之中，尚在且看下回分解之例，既無可説，亦不必説，現在所談的，便是在鄉六日之中，若欲將我六日中的生活狀況奉告則一言蔽之，惟有忙忙碌碌過這舊曆新年而已。</p>
<p>惟舊歷新年，亦説是陰曆新年，這種新年，已名為廢歷，而且也廢之已久，即使度過這種勞什子的新年，尚有什麼忙碌，尚有什麼事情，豈知事實告訴我們，竟不是如此。事實上內地祇有陰曆的新年，而不知陽曆的新年，此種原因，第一是社會的結習，第二是腦筋的頑固，結習是一時不易解除的，腦筋也非一時所能轉變的，説起來很是容易，做起來十分為難，我現在且寫一些轉變為難的情形，不能説是經驗之談，也可説事宜所遭如此。</p>
<p>這種情形，容我一一説來，將到廢曆的年關，便有親戚朋友送年糕來，或是禮物來，若過二十以後，送灶獻上地的爆竹聲，便連珠箭似的放個不絕，假定腦筋衰弱人，包你一夜合不攏眼。若一到新年，更是五花八門了，家家紅燭高燒，大紅緞的披座，張的必挺，更是氣象萬千，苦走到人家去，便有糖果，水果，糕餅等精美的果盤，端送出來，僕人還不絕地連呌幾聲恭喜，在這時，我怎樣可以不伸“伸腰，挖一些腰包出來呢？還有如在路上遇見朋友，或在家接見親戚，還是兜頭一揖，恭喜發財的吉利語，應運而出，這時難道你不作一聲麼？若走到大街去，無論大小店家，多上排鬥，享你一個閉鬥羹，只聽見年鑼年鼓叮咚聲，自內而出，除了烟紙糖果店數家外，差不多沒有一些東西可以買到，若走到廟寺中去，則燒香的人，便是人山人海；擁擠不堪，而小本營生的擔子攤頭，排得水洩不通，賣畫張，賣泥佛，賣糖，碗，賣花砲，賣線粉湯，觸處皆是，在這樣的環境之中，怎樣可以跳出環境，而不去過年呢？除非不住在這個社會之內，假定不住在這個社會，而到別一個社會裹去，也是如此，假定你不受環境的支配，他們儘管過他們的年，你盡管過你的年，人家不是説你矯情，便是説你怪物，試問你有事大能力，可以打破此環境，反抗這社會。鄉間且不必説，我昨日到所謂東方紐約的上海來，數數有幾家店家開門，到城隍廟裹去，休想還有你立足的餘地。</p>
<h3>幸福</h3>
<p>— 希美</p>
<p>幸福是誰都想要的，但是幸福決不能來找人，卻要人去找幸福。</p>
<p>找幸福第一個條件，就是先要有強健的身體。身體虛弱的人，即使有財富，有名譽，有地位，也是不會快樂的，所以幸福好比一個大廈，康健就是造大廈的基石，康健和幸福的關係既然是如此重要，人們想找幸福，就要先健全自己的身體，假使是患貧血的，就應服補血的藥品，假使是有肺病傾向的，就應服魚肝油。。五洲藥房的自來血，本牌魚肝油、效力最偉，調服身體日健，幸福無量！</p>
<h3>交際花自述</h3>
<p>— 鳳</p>
<p>她是一個交際花，一般人對於都是很愛慕的。</p>
<p>她的面容是那樣的美艷，皮膚非常嫩白。頭髮很光亮，時時透出芬芳的香氣。尤其是牙齒，真是潔白得和玉石一樣。</p>
<p>有人詢問她的生活，她説：“別人一定要當我是研究化裝的，其實我的化裝術非常簡單，我盥面以後敷用“一品香”，頭髪上只洒“一三一頭水”，每天早晚用“一三一牙膏”刷牙，就是這樣罷了。”</p>
<p>她又説：“現在用洋貨的時代已經過去了。在交際區中用國貨，既漂亮，又經濟，所以我用的這幾種化裝品，都是五　大藥房的出品　。”</p>
<h3>馬路英雄</h3>
<p>— 羅才清</p>
<p>一到新年，果然好一番新年氣象，即使大除夕被債務及俗務弄得昏頭昏腦的人們，在高拱雙手，喊着“恭喜發財”的時候，就像脱胎換骨，重新做人了。</p>
<p>過新年自然是可喜的，它不但説明了每个人已经增加了一歲，而且在新的一年中前程是未可限量。商店里東家要接財神，店伙則搬出鑼鼓家伙來從年初一敲到元宵節；説不定一時興起，到馬路上去兜個圈子，倒是頗為熱鬧的，因為新年中的馬路也似乎是他們的地盤。敲敲年鑼年鼓還是安份守己的，另外一種是專向婦女身上投金錢砲，“轟然一聲，拍掌大笑”，與古之英雄“路見不平，拔刀相助”，卻是個絕妙對照，稱之曰：“馬路英雄”就是這個意思，并沒有故意刻毒他們。</p>
<p>從前在報上讀到過許多“推”“踢”“踏”等文章，現在的“投”或許又是一種新的“藝術”，因為被投者興被推，被踢，被踏者，同樣重則傷身，輕則面紅耳赤，不過“投”祇是以婦女為目標而已。</p>
<p>筆者很少在上海過年，即使在上海過年，也很少到馬路上去“軋鬧猛”，所以看見“轟然一聲”認為是奇事，後來知道“投金錢砲”，是由來久矣。據説租界上的馬路章程，對於黃包車夫的照會是設想頗為週到，譬如靠左邊走，紅綠燈，以及什麼，因為有撞傷行人的危險，卻沒有禁止投金錢砲這一條例，尤其在新年中，已經是司空見慣的一種“點綴”了。這恩典，似乎更切實“馬路英維”的名稱了。</p>
<p>但是被我看到了這種情形之後，就胡思亂想起來，敲敲年鑼年鼓，倒是“與衆同樂”的玩意兒，自己“鏘東鏘東”的敲着，人家從窗口里探出頭來，在馬路走的會突然站定了脚，看你手舞足蹈，不是已夠“英雄”了嗎？偏偏另外要投金錢砲，被罵“殺千刀”或許姑以為“打情罵俏”，是頗合英雄們胃口的，假使一旦而“重則傷身”那末“英雄”沒有做成，而做階下囚，似乎太令人氣短了。結</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>果我把這罪孽推到製造金錢砲者的身上，而且果然也讀得了一條“大快人心”的新聞：本地人徐寶寶，二十六歲，其弟寶興，二十三歲，同住於虹口虬江路一四六拜一四號，日前兄弟二人合股購買大批甩砲原料，在家日夜趕製，預備在廢曆年内出售，藉以圖利，昨日下午一時半，詎二人製造之際，甩砲原料突然爆炸，二人不及逃避，均被炸傷面手等處甚重，後由家人將二人車送醫院醫治，據云：徐寶寶受傷頗重，恐有性命之虞云云。</p>
<p>這説法倒有點替馬路英雄做辯護人，不過人家在收買爛銅爛鐵製造炸彈，收買絲繭做飛機傘的時候，我不禁想起類似“轟然一聲”的一二八砲聲了，那徐氏兄弟不死於一二八砲火之下，而死於“甩砲原料突然爆炸”，而那些馬路英雄們也還是描凖了婦女們胸前，拿金錢砲投過去，“轟然一聲，拍掌大笑”，覺得五年光陰眞是過去得太快了！</p>
<h3>殿</h3>
<p>— 中冰</p>
<p>一切只有空虛的沉寂。有如一個虔心的修煉者，殿竟日嚴肅而無語。</p>
<p>五十二級艱難的石階上，殿被構筑在玄遠的虛空裏。直斜的線，勻凈的弧；那比櫛如鱗的瓦稜，嚴整的廡廊圓柱，和著簷角的古敗的風鈴，這古典的諧和。</p>
<p>殿門首兩匹舞爪張牙的石獅守衛着，但一切只有空虛的沉寂。殿門裹，瀰散著烟的雲霧，馨香的雲霧，和長明燈傾潑出來的光的雲霧。映在麻黃的帷幕上的長明燈的幽光，像未入歛的死人脚前悽冥的燈光映在喪色的素幕上，寂靜冰冷地凝成一片。</p>
<p>透過帷幕的流蘇般的繡邊，木雕的偶像卑遜地立在佛龕的方寸裹，泥塑的偶像坐在清凈而超凡的蓮花瓣上。而一切偶像的眼睛却存在着雕塑者的古典的匠心，放出慈悲的目光，撫視着虔心的弟子們一而加以超度。</p>
<p>瀰散着烟的雲霧，馨香的雲霧，和长明灯傾潑出來的光的雲霧，殿被薰陶着，被感化着，忍耐着冷寂和死靜。在佛殿的空氣裹，靜寂像精細的擴音器，把夜課的細微的聲樂擴大為嘹亮，為幽遠。於是在嚴的靜默裹，繼續着清越的木魚聲，洪亮的銅鈸聲，這和讚的調子。</p>
<p>殿終占嚴肅而無語。一切只有空虛的沉寂。</p>

<p>臘去春回萬象新，聲聲爆竹表歡欣。家家齊把桃符換，鑼鼓聲中祝太平。大家小户都歡樂，聲聲恭喜笑盈盈。有的是，温酒一杯家庭樂，門生故舊共談心。有的是，笙簫弦管歌一曲，卿吹短笛吹笙。有的是新年握管題紅取吉語，稱心如意四時亨。有的是，淸興八圈把和來碰，消閒不必講輸贏。有的是雙雙携手游春去，卿卿我我倍多情。有的是，俏皮兒童把小炮摜，一聲一響一心驚。路上游人多於蝍，件件衣衫耀眼睛。其實是，新年原是舊人物，何必衣衫件件新。雖則相沿稱習俗，也算得，一年一度一開心。無新年來點綴，大除夕，結賬總管結勿淸。我願大家從頭起，及時努力運機心，一年之計在於春。</p>

<h3>中國兒童戲劇的號聲</h3>
<p>「我們的兒童劇社」即將成立訊</p>
<p>中國戲劇界對於兒童戲劇素來不注意，但兒童戲劇在兒童教育方面，確爲重要之工作，故本市各劇團中之年齡較幼者，感覺一般劇團不能使他們有研究或才能的機會，並深知兒童戲劇急需兒童自身來推進，故於去年九月即發起「我們的兒團劇社」之組織，籌備迄今，用他自身之經濟與力量，艱難地工作起來，曾於去年十一月排演「砲火中」及「野孩子們」等劇，擬參加大晚報「童友會」之成立大會，然因劇本遭租界當局禁演，而「童友會」之「古廟鐘聲」亦遭禁演，於是得「古廟鐘聲」大部份演員之參加，益增厚該社之力量，並於十二月聖誕者節經聖徳學校之邀請，演出「野孩子們」一劇，頗得好評，又於十二月發起「上海戲劇界援綏聯合公演」之舉，得本市三十餘劇團之參加，然因時局及審查劇本手續問題，至本年一月底社會局才批示准演二十六個劇本，禁演十個劇本，彼時該社正積極籌備成立大會及公演三幕兒童劇「愛的教育」，不及重行召集各劇團，使「援綏聯合公演」實行，後又因劇塲問題，經該社第九次籌備會議决：暫緩舉行公演，提前召開成立大會，「援綏聯合公演」亦因社會局所通過之劇本，大半爲租界以前所禁演，而南市，閘北等區各戲院對戲劇演出並不贊同，故亦經該社籌備會議决中止進行，現聞該社已有三十餘社員，即將舉行成立大會，並發出緣起及徵求贊助人，贊助團體之函件云。</p>

Merchants and residents, having heard of the incident, dug cellars in every home. The city walls and the new city walls were almost entirely dug into to avoid bombs.

<p>[Xi'an] The majority of Zhang Xueliang's troops who withdrew are still in the area of Fuping Kangqiao Town Jiaokou Town, along the west bank of the Shichuan River. Due to the large number of people and the impoverished nature of the area, supplies are very difficult. Recently, they have been forcibly requisitioning grain and materials from the people to supply the military. The people are suffering from the exploitation. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 13th)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] Yang Hucheng recently felt that the county militias he had organized were largely unreliable, so he appointed Liu Xiangting, the head of the Xing Town militia, and Li Huanqing, the head of the Meiyuan militia, to be the heads of the militias in their respective areas, issuing 300 short guns to each.

Passenger and freight trains will run on the western section of the Longhai Railway in one or two days. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3>Weng Wenhao Discusses the Recent Situation in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>And New Executive Yuan Measures</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A reporter visited Executive Yuan Secretary-General Weng Wenhao on the 13th, inquiring about the recent situation in Xi'an regarding post-incident affairs, and the new political measures implemented by the Executive Yuan in recent years. He provided the following information. Mr. Weng first said that after the Xi'an Incident occurred, not only did Shaanxi and Gansu suffer heavy losses, but the general construction projects were also severely affected. Fortunately, it has been completely resolved. In addition to Chairman Sun Weiru's telegram to the Executive Yuan the other day indicating his intention to assume his new post, another memorial has arrived, reporting on the progress of provincial administration reform. The candidates for the heads of various departments of the provincial government are currently being selected and will be presented to the Executive Yuan for discussion and appointment in the next few days. In the past year, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, all departments have worked diligently. For example, the rapid expansion and progress of new railways is unprecedented since the Republic. Other examples include the establishment of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to improve rice and wheat, the planning and construction of vegetable oil factories and steel factories, the expansion of long-distance telephones, the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau, the increase of compulsory education funding, the establishment of county and municipal administrative training institutes, the implementation of the legal tender policy, and the implementation of income tax. For local administration, particular emphasis is placed on reorganizing security teams, implementing land registration, promoting bandit suppression in border areas, and proposing central construction projects. These have all been repeatedly ordered and urged, and either have been successfully implemented or are in progress. The best way to manage central and local administration is to have a periodic plan that specifically stipulates the work to be emphasized during a certain period, so that personnel can concentrate their efforts and actively manage it. For example, county magistrates often feel that there are too many central government orders and that local funds are insufficient to implement them. However, the most important aspect of local finance is land tax. Currently, most counties rely solely on extremely old registers as the basis for assessment, and some have even lost all of the old fish-scale registers, resulting in extremely unfair tax allocation. Poor landowners often bear a large amount of land tax and surcharges, while landowners with very large areas either do not pay tax or pay very little. The government should conduct a thorough investigation and implement land registration and measurement to ensure that the people bear the burden evenly, and increase revenue without adding taxes. There are already many successful examples of this work, and the provincial governments should formulate methods and implement them effectively. From this one example, it can be seen that it is necessary to have a definite plan for administration. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 13th)</p>

<h3>Chairman Lin's Seventieth Birthday on the Lunar New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Central Government Awards Scholarship Fund of 200,000; Other Birthday Celebrations Foregone</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Congratulatory telegrams for Chairman Lin's seventieth birthday continue to arrive like snowflakes. Those received by the National Government on the 13th included those from Cai Yuanpei, Xie Chi, Xiong Kewu, Liu Shouzhong, Yang Shukan, Xu Shiying, Gu Weijun, Yu Xuezhong, Wu Tiecheng, Ma Bufang, Feng Qinzai, Ren Ke Cheng, and party departments and civic groups in various provinces and cities such as Shandong, Guangdong, Hunan, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Jiangxi.

<p>[Nanjing] The Central Political Council held its 86th meeting at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 10th, chaired by Chairman Wang. After the meeting began, the chairman reported that the Standing Committee members of the Central Executive Committee, Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Zhaoming, Zou Lu, Ye Chucang, Feng Yuxiang, Kong Xiangxi, and Chen Lifu, had decided today to award a scholarship memorial fund of 200,000 yuan to National Government Chairman Lin Zichao, and presented a report. The scholarship fund regulations will be handled by the secretariat in consultation with Chairman Lin. The allocation procedures will be determined separately by the council. Routine cases were then discussed, with four cases referred to the specialized committees on internal affairs, legislation, and transportation for review, and eight budget estimates were approved. After the discussion, Chairman Lin rose and said that the 11th was the anniversary of his mother's death and that he had declined all celebrations. He had just heard that the Central Government was awarding a scholarship memorial fund, which he could not refuse out of respect, but felt ashamed to accept. However, he thought that the purpose of this measure was to encourage scholarship. Since the Central Government was doing this, it would be a memorial for his seventieth birthday, so he could not refuse and expressed his deep gratitude and embarrassment. All the committee members present believed that Chairman Lin was the head of state, and that the country should hold a celebration to express respect on the occasion of his birthday. At that time, some advocated for a one-day holiday, some advocated for hanging flags to celebrate, some advocated for going to his residence to congratulate him, and some advocated for group banquets. However, Chairman Lin repeatedly declined and politely thanked the people and his colleagues in the Central Government, asking them to understand his intentions and avoid making him uneasy. The committee members, deeply moved by Chairman Lin's sincere humility, decided that all birthday celebrations would be canceled. Chairman Lin then gladly left the meeting. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 10th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The 11th was National Government Chairman Lin's seventieth birthday, coinciding with the lunar New Year's Day.

Chairman Lin, having repeatedly declined all birthday celebrations at the Central Political Council meeting on the 10th, originally intended to leave Nanjing to avoid the birthday, but later felt that it would be inconvenient, so he decided to rest at his residence on the 11th. Therefore, all the dignitaries who went to his private residence on the 11th to offer birthday congratulations were politely declined by Chairman Lin's staff and only left their calling cards. Those who went to the National Government to offer birthday congratulations were received by Chief Aide-de-Camp Lu Chao, who recorded their names and then politely declined them. The three chiefs of the National Government, the Chief Secretary, the Chief Aide-de-Camp, and the Comptroller General, followed Chairman Lin's wishes and did not go to his residence to offer birthday congratulations on the 11th.

<h3>Liu Jianxu Discusses Bandit Suppression Military Affairs</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Liu Jianxu, the Pacification Director of the Fujian-Zhejiang-Anhui-Jiangxi Border Region, stated that the bandits in the four-province border region are all remnants of Fang Zhimin's forces. They have been entrenched in the border areas of the four provinces for ten years. After successive suppressions by Luo Zhuoying, Jiang Dingwen, Zhang Fakui, etc., Fang Zhimin was arrested and executed. The bandits then fragmented into smaller groups, becoming elusive. I was ordered to assume my current position in December of last year. Due to the impact of the Xi'an Incident, I was unable to launch immediate suppression. I started the suppression on January 15th of this year, adopting a gradual approach. First, I rectified military discipline to achieve cooperation between the military and the people. Since the suppression began, the remaining bandit groups have been surrounded, and those who were coerced into joining have surrendered one after another. In the future, we will cooperate with the people, coordinate military and political affairs, and expect to completely eliminate them within six months. Investigations reveal that among the remaining bandits in the four provinces, those in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Anhui border region include Xu Yongjian and Yu Jinbiao, with approximately two to three hundred people and weapons, entrenched in Pan Cen at the border of Yiyang and Hengfeng. In the Wen-Chu area of Fujian and Zhejiang, there is Liu Ying's bandit gang, scattered between Fuding and Pingyang, which is about to be completely eliminated. A portion of the bandit gang is gathering in the Yanghuai Jiujiuwan area between Ningguo, Yin County, Tong'an, and Wuyuan. A telegram received on the 12th stated that they have been eliminated. In addition, there are two groups of bandits, Liu Dayun and Huang Dao, with approximately two hundred people each, gathering in Bilongyuan Kuijialing area in Longpu Songxi Suichang. They will soon be suppressed. (13th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes the Slavery Convention</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan convened its 91st meeting on the morning of the 12th, with 67 members including Zhao Maohua present. Sun Ke presided as Chairman, and Liang Hancao as Secretary-General. The Convention on Slavery was passed according to the review report of the Foreign Affairs and Criminal Law Committees and should be ratified.

After our country submits the ratification documents to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, the convention will take effect in our country. It seems that there will be no difficulty in implementing the convention in our country in the future, because our criminal law already has provisions for punishing those who enslave others, which is in line with the main purpose of the convention.

<p>Tokyo Correspondence</p>
<h3>The Formation of the Hayashi Cabinet</h3>
<p>— Nan Yun</p>
<p>Army Department's command:</p>
<p>"Right face... turn!"</p>
<p>Those who disobey this command are punished: "Leftist" elements become "ideological offenders." If they don't show "reorientation," they will never breathe the air outside the window again. Those who are extremely "right-leaning" are also not allowed; the group of soldiers who launched the "February 26th" incident suffered greatly. Furthermore, those who don't turn enough when following the command to turn to the right are also unacceptable—Ugaki thought he was an army general and should qualify, but he ultimately couldn't take office.</p>
<p>Who doesn't know that a "right turn" should be ninety degrees? And everyone knows that:</p>
<p>The direction of advancement is — "Greater Japanism."</p>
<p>The route of advancement is — "Continental Policy."</p>
<p>However, since the "September 18th Incident," the Army Department has not found a Minister of War who turned appropriately.</p>
<p>Before the "September 18th Incident," Ugaki had served as Minister of War three times and Governor-General of Korea once. He only stepped down last August. Ugaki is a soldier and politician with "skill" and "talent," as all newspapers have recognized. But, "the son of a good doctor dies of illness," and Ugaki, who came from the army, failed due to the opposition of the army.</p>
<p>It is not that Ugaki refused to turn to the right, but that the Army Department felt that he couldn't turn to the correct degree. It's not that he didn't know the goal and route, but that they feared he wouldn't have the strong "control" when "starting to walk."</p>
<p>The current cabinet's mission is to complete the "quasi-wartime system." The "quasi-wartime system" includes: (1) Strengthening national defense, (2) Renewing general administration, (3) Purging the military.</p>
<p>Regarding the "purging the military" work, it has been almost completed after several "major army and navy shifts" last year. The "administrative reform plan" proposed by the military (the army takes the leading position) is the content of "renewing general administration." It is clear that the government demanded by the military is a "strengthened control" government. The parliament demanded by the military is a parliament that must not interfere with the government. At the same time, the government and parliament must respect "national defense firstism" and accept the expansion of military spending as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Ugaki forming a cabinet is an obstacle to achieving the "purging the military." The army had made such a statement of opposition.</p>
<p>If the military cannot be purged, the administration cannot be renewed; if the administration cannot be renewed, "national defense firstism" and even Greater Japanism cannot be realized—this is the Army Department's logic.</p>
<p>How to prove that Ugaki is an obstacle to achieving the "purging the military"? The army based its argument on Ugaki's history: As Minister of War in the Kiyoura Cabinet, Ugaki had reduced four divisions of the army; as Minister of War in the Kiyoura Cabinet, Ugaki had concluded the London Naval Treaty—what the Army Department called the "weak treaty."</p>
<p>Whether Ugaki still advocates military reduction today is irrelevant. In short, in this era when military expansion should be actively pursued, Ugaki must be absolutely rejected, so Ugaki failed.</p>
<p>The one who succeeded Ugaki in receiving the imperial mandate was also an army general—Hayashi Senjūrō.</p>
<p>General Hayashi's prestige became well-known during the "September 18th Incident." At that time, General Hayashi was the commander of the Korean Army. After the "September 18th Incident," General Hayashi led his troops across the Manchurian border without waiting for orders from his superiors. According to custom, General Hayashi should not have taken this free action without orders from his superiors. Therefore, after the "September 18th Incident," General Hayashi was called the Border-Crossing General. (See Reader's Digest, January 30th)</p>
<p>Secondly, the "February 26th Incident," in which young army officers attacked senior statesmen and elders, occurred during the period when General Hayashi was serving as Minister of War. General Hayashi retired because of this incident. What about now? Some of the young officers who initiated the "February 26th Incident" have been executed, some have committed suicide, and some have been imprisoned. Furthermore, after several "military purges" by War Minister Terauchi during the Hirota Cabinet, there shouldn't be much of a problem—at this time, General Hayashi came forward to form a cabinet.</p>
<p>The current army leadership has expressed its approval of General Hayashi forming a cabinet. However, while approving, it also expressed its "expectations" for General Hayashi. These "expectations" are: "To decisively implement national defense enhancement, military discipline correction, and the renewal of general administration."</p>
<p>To achieve the above goals, the following should be implemented immediately: (1) Most ministers hold multiple positions (in the "administrative reform plan" proposed by the military, there are opinions on merging agencies to strengthen control). (2) Partisans who have not broken away from established political parties are not allowed to enter the cabinet. (3) Dissolve the current parliament. (According to Reader's Digest)</p>
<p>Regarding these "expectations," General Hayashi must have already planned for them in terms of implementation, otherwise he wouldn't have come forward. With the courage of the "Border-Crossing General," it seems that he can realize this strong cabinet.</p>
<p>The Army Department has always been playing the leading role. Let's look at other aspects.</p>
<p>The most recent reason for the Hirota Cabinet's resignation was the conflict between War Minister Terauchi and Representative Hamada (a member of the Seiyūkai party), which generally speaking, was a conflict between the Army Department and parliament. But at the time, Navy Minister Nagano also played an important role—a role in mediating the compromise between the military and political parties. The Navy Minister's mediation essentially proved that the opinions of the army and navy leaders were inconsistent. The inconsistent opinions of the army and navy did not just begin recently. Let's not talk about the distant past: just look at the navy's "Southern Advance Theory" and the army's "Northern Advance Theory" in recent years to understand. But the "Northern Advance Theory" clearly has the advantage. The various facts since the "September 18th Incident" have proven this. Therefore, the current military is essentially led by the Army Department. However, the army can only achieve complete victory with the "cooperation" or "wait and see" attitude of the navy. When the army opposed Ugaki, the navy "waited and saw," and the army won. Today (January 30th), the army expressed support for the Hayashi Cabinet, and with the navy also in a "wait and see" attitude, the army will of course be able to win again. If the navy expresses the opposite opinion, it will not succeed. There are many such examples in Japanese history. But, the navy is "waiting and seeing," which is cautious and also leaves room for future expression.</p>
<p>The Minseitō party had expressed support for Ugaki, and the Seiyūkai party had also expressed a "wait and see" favor toward Ugaki, but when Ugaki was suffering from the army's opposition, they didn't have even the slightest action to support him. They watched Ugaki fall by the wayside. After Ugaki fell, both the Minseitō and Seiyūkai parties became even more fearful. The "established political parties" referred to by the Army Department are the Minseitō and Seiyūkai parties. Now, the Minseitō and Seiyūkai parties are facing the crisis of parliament dissolution. But they still dare not express an actively opposing attitude toward General Hayashi, who is responsible for the mission of dissolution. This is clearly an irreversible decline of constitutional government.</p>
<p>Capitalists and the press generally went through the motions of supporting Ugaki on the surface. The emerging Sumitomo Zaibatsu and Noguchi Zaibatsu had a particularly deep relationship with Ugaki. They had expressed particular support. But, the soaring military demand stocks fell in price, which was a fatal blow to Ugaki. In recent years, the Japanese economy has only been a ____ of the military demand industry. Only when the capitalists of the military demand industry secretly oppose, is it difficult for Ugaki to gain a foothold. What's more, the one directly boosting the military demand economy and frontally confronting Ugaki is the Army Department. Regarding General Hayashi's rise to power, the Mitsubishi Bank's opinion is: "The expansion of government spending and the strengthening of the controlled economy are inevitable..." The Mitsui Bank only expressed opinions on the selection of the Minister of Finance: "The Minister of Finance we hope for is someone with abundant financial and economic knowledge and who also understands all current situations." Mitsui and Mitsubishi are Japan's largest financial capitalists. Although the monopolistic opposition of Mitsui and Mitsubishi cannot be resolved, the goal of expanding resources and markets is the same. And the expansion and monopolization of the market cannot do without military force, so, of course, they must support the Hayashi Cabinet, although the degree of support is different.</p>
<p>After the Hayashi Cabinet appeared, the fascist color of Japanese politics became more pronounced—this is a unanimous observation from all sides.</p>
<p>Groups with a stronger fascist color, such as the Meirin Association, had encouraged the military to oppose Ugaki, and now, of course, they will encourage General Hayashi.</p>
<p>In short, in this stage of financial capital vying for "monopoly," the middle class is panicking, and the burden on the working masses is heavier. Established political parties are disintegrating, fascist parties are rising, and liberal constitutionalism is declining. At the same time, the international war crisis is deepening.</p>

<h3>Discussion of the Joint Examination Problem</h3>
<p>— Wu Shichang</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese education at the secondary level and above has made significant progress. Although it is still far from our ideal standards, it is distinctly different from the restless and perfunctory situation before the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. The increase in the number of educated people, the enrichment of facilities in various schools, the serious responsibility of government authorities at all levels in charge of education, and the progress of various academic researches have all brought us a little comfort amidst this precarious and turbulent national crisis. However, there are still many areas where we feel that immediate improvement is necessary. Now, let's first talk about the issue of joint examinations.</p>
<p>The joint examination is a major event that educational authorities in various provinces have been most serious about and have strived to hold in the past four or five years. However, it has always been limited to middle schools and has not extended to universities, which makes us feel that there is a need for discussion. The benefits of the middle school joint examination are obvious to most people: it can standardize the level of middle schools and encourage middle school teachers and students to teach and study seriously. (I say "standardize" instead of "improve" because middle school textbooks have a fixed standard, and the joint examination questions cannot exceed the textbooks.) However, few people pay attention to the drawbacks it causes. As far as we know, there are at least the following: First, most (perhaps all) schools, in order to compete for rankings in the joint examination results, simply do not teach formal subjects in the second semester of the third year of junior and senior high school. Instead, they focus on teaching students various test questions and various test-taking techniques, abandoning serious academic studies. This is tantamount to giving the entire middle school education an 84% discount. As for the isolation from extracurricular reading and the lack of general knowledge training, these phenomena existed long before the second semester of the third year. Second, many schools with lower levels and poorer teachers have to use various unreasonable methods to force students to study by rote, doing test questions repeatedly every day, and even abolishing holidays and opening night classes, which has a great impact on the health of young people. Schools with good levels also have this situation in order to compete for rankings. A good example is a certain middle school that ranked first in the Jiangsu provincial joint examination in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934] and was attacked by local people for not paying enough attention to students' health. Third, many middle schools, fearing that the average score of the entire class in the joint examination would be low, conceal and do not report some students with lower grades when submitting the joint examination report, depriving them of the opportunity to further their studies forever. The student dispute with the school at Huibei Middle School in Peiping [Beijing] last summer arose because of this. As for whether it is reasonable for a high school graduate to go through a triple jump of graduation examination, joint examination, and university entrance examination in one summer, it is also a question worth considering. All of this was probably not considered by those who initially advocated the middle school joint examination system.</p>
<p>The pros and cons of the middle school joint examination system need to be measured by a very accurate investigation in order to decide whether to reform or abolish this system in the future. However, from a general point of view, the middle school joint examination is far less urgent and necessary than the university joint examination. Middle school students do not need to and do not have to enter university, so general physical and mental training and the acquisition of broad knowledge in life are much more important than repeated exercises of test questions. Middle school courses often take more than 30 hours per week. One hour of class requires two hours of preparation and homework, plus military training, memorial weeks, etc. If there are not 25 hours in a day, how can they have the time to acquire broad knowledge, develop reading habits, and how can it not affect their developing physical and mental health? Secondly, middle school teaching materials are relatively standardized. As long as teachers teach seriously, the level difference will not be too great. Unlike some academic fields in universities, teaching entirely relies on the results of professors' research, and the level can vary greatly, requiring a higher standard for comparison. Therefore, whether middle schools need joint examinations is open to discussion, while university joint examinations appear to be more essential in various aspects. However, to discuss the pros and cons of university joint examinations, we must first briefly explain the methods of this system in order to have a basis. We now tentatively propose the following specific plans:</p>
<p>㊀ The graduation examinations of all universities in the country shall be presided over by the state. Only those who pass the national examination shall be awarded degrees.</p>
<p>㊁ This examination may be presided over by an expert committee composed of professors from various universities and senior scholars in the academic community appointed by the Ministry of Education. Under this committee, several subcommittees shall be formed for different subjects (such as the physics subcommittee, the history subcommittee, etc.). The subcommittees shall draft test questions and send them to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education shall select the questions and secretly distribute them to various universities for candidates to take the test. The test shall be held on the same day nationwide, and administrative personnel from each university shall invigilate the test. The test papers shall be submitted to the Ministry of Education and forwarded to various committee members for evaluation. Those who pass shall be awarded degrees by the Ministry of Education; otherwise, they shall not be allowed to call themselves graduates of a certain university or "× Bachelor."</p>
<p>㊂ Any student who has studied for more than three years at a national or registered private university may take the examination. To encourage poor scholars, non-university students who have written works and have made definite contributions to academics may also take the examination with the approval of more than a certain number of specialized committee members. (For science and engineering students with experiments, the restrictions may be slightly stricter.)</p>
<p>㊃ The examination courses for each department shall cover the main courses of the department, at least ten or fifteen or more. One subject may be tested for one or two days. The time may be extended to about one month for rest and preparation. Students who fail this year may take the examination again next year.</p>
<p>㊄ The list of candidates shall be submitted to the Ministry of Education by each school in advance. Individual candidates shall register with the local education bureau and submit the list to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education shall issue assigned numbers. The test papers shall use numbers instead of names of students or schools. There are still many unreasonable situations in university education in various places. However, if we want to reform, it is often very difficult due to various problems such as political situation, factions, systems, and personnel: this is undeniable. I believe that the implementation of this system is the simplest, fairest, and most effective method to solve the above-mentioned difficulties. At the same time, there are many other benefits, which are briefly described below:</p>
<p>First, the level of all universities in the country can be improved consistently. The levels of various universities today differ greatly, especially in the fields of arts and law. The lack of objective standards makes it easy to be corrupt and perfunctory, which is criticized by people. It is better for the Ministry of Education to hold joint examinations than to restrict enrollment, because the former damages students' interests and obliterates factual needs, while the latter is the best way to improve and standardize the level. If this system is implemented, the materials tested by students nationwide will be consistent, and universities everywhere will immediately have three direct demands: ㊀ The courses of various universities must meet the standards set by the expert committee, only more, not less: at the same time, courses that are perfunctory, ridiculous, used to collect credits, and muddled through will naturally be eliminated, and personnel problems will also be solved accordingly. ㊁ The content of basic courses must be enriched to meet the joint examination requirements. In this way, not only students but also old professors will be forced to work hard together. ㊂ Various universities must clarify the departments. Novel and ridiculous departments will naturally be abolished, and mixed departments cannot but be rectified clearly.</p>
<p>Second, the economy of university administration and expenses. If this system is implemented, students will have to seek practical knowledge to take the examination. All other reputations are of no benefit to them. Schools and students will have to strive for practicality and tension to increase efficiency. Universities that are neither fish nor fowl will naturally be eliminated, which can save society a lot of waste.</p>
<p>Third, cultivate a free research atmosphere. At this moment, only children from middle-class families or above in China have the opportunity to pursue advanced academics, which is an extremely unreasonable thing. Individuals who do not enter university can freely study in public libraries and can take the academic examination based on their writings, which is the only possible way to remedy this phenomenon. Also, those who were middle school and university students in the past and are employed in various places can also be encouraged to devote themselves to academics in their spare time to prepare for the examination.</p>
<p>Fourth, help solve the social unemployment problem. At present, university student unemployment is the most serious phenomenon in society, and many social unrests arise because of this. Moreover, the problem is not only unemployment. Many university students can only work as clerks, or cannot even be qualified as clerks, and thus resent the unfairness of society. If joint examinations are implemented, so that they know their position compared to the national standard even though they are university students, they can also be dedicated and diligent in lower positions, so that not everyone has a sense of being unappreciated and increases social unrest. At the same time, people with real talent can also receive fair treatment and will not be hindered by factional systems in the cultivation of talent.</p>
<p>Five years ago, I once discussed the issue of reforming higher education with Mr. Fu Mengzhen, and I also mentioned this issue (Independent Review, No. 17). At that time, we hoped that this ideal might be realized in three to five years. If the Ministry of Education can start preparations at this time, we hope that it can be piloted this summer. As for the detailed plan, it must be carefully studied. This article is just a suggestion. February 9, 26th year of the Republic [1937], Lugia Mountain, Wuchang.</p>
<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Announces Plan to Raise Huge Sum to Strengthen National Defense</h3>
<p>Raising £400 Million in Bonds within Five Years　White Paper to Be Released on Tuesday　No Less Than a Warning to Germany</p>
<p>[London] In response to questions from Labor Member of Parliament Attlee in the House of Commons today, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain stated that the government will raise £400 million in bonds within the next five years to strengthen British national defense. According to Chamberlain, the government intends to immediately submit a bill to Parliament to increase assets or utilize the surplus in the budget to meet national defense needs. The raised debt is planned to be repaid in installments over 30 years. Chamberlain also declared that, based on the experience of the past year, the urgency of our arduous work has not been reduced in the slightest, and our burden of strengthening national defense to the planned level has not been lightened in the slightest. The increase in British national defense expenditure is extremely rapid, and it cannot be fully met with annual revenue. The amount required now and the years of allocation cannot be predicted at this time, but the total amount of the debt will not exceed £400 million. The necessary financial decisions will be submitted to Parliament in a white paper by the government. Chamberlain also advocated that the expenditure of this debt should be managed by the Treasury and not directly by the national defense agencies, and that all national defense expenditure should be approved by Parliament. (Central News Agency, London, Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[London] The proposal to allow the Ministry of Finance to raise bonds or use the budget surplus to fund national defense expenditure, the amount of which shall not exceed £400 million and shall be raised over five years, announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the House of Commons last night, will be submitted to Parliament as soon as possible. The bill may be introduced in the House of Commons on Thursday and will be debated after the members have fully studied the white paper to be released by the government on February 16. The white paper will contain information on the progress of the government's various national defense programs and will roughly contain some plans for the coming year, as well as explaining the urgency of the government having the right to raise £400 million. The content of the bill announced last night is that the bonds raised for national defense purposes will pay interest at 3%, and after the five-year period expires, the principal and interest will be repaid over 30 years. The Times commented on the government's proposal, saying that the government's new debt of £400 million has no problem of being thrown on the market, nor is there any sign of an immediate subscription. The money will be borrowed over five years, and when needed, the Ministry of Finance will issue a type of security based on already or to be raised public bonds. The new borrowing is not £400 million as its total amount, but £400 million as its highest limit. To exceed this limit, new legislation must be enacted. Technically speaking, what the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced yesterday was nothing more than the establishment of an institution for capable financial management, the details of which will be determined by Parliament according to the needs of future circumstances. The British government's determination and ability to implement national defense programs are further demonstrated by this. The various efforts of the government departments to consolidate national defense at the same time can be relied upon with greater confidence, and the harmful policy of exhausting all resources and wasting huge sums to expand armaments throughout the world may also be deterred by this. We have great expectations for this, and so on. (Central News Agency, London, Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>[London] Diplomatic circles today felt that German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop visited Acting Foreign Secretary Sir Halifax twenty minutes after Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain announced the plan to raise national defense bonds in the House of Commons. It is a question of whether it was predetermined or a coincidence. Officials denied any relationship between the two, but it is generally believed that this gesture aims to warn Germany that Britain will soon be the country with the most complete defense capabilities. Financial authorities estimate that Britain will spend £900 million to overhaul its armaments and maintain its fighting power within five years. (12th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Expansion Plan Emphasizes Air Defense</h3>
<p>Army to Be Mechanized</p>
<p>[London] Responsible sources recently announced that after Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain announced yesterday that the government would issue £400 million in national defense bonds, a large-scale reform plan in military affairs would follow. The detailed plan will be announced in the form of a white paper on the 16th of this month. The main points are as follows: ㊀ Increase the amount of military pay and bonuses so that people can enthusiastically enlist when the regular army is recruited. Improve the training system for those responsible for the air defense of the mainland territory. ㊁ Most troops will implement large-scale mechanization. According to British authorities, the idea of dispatching troops to the European continent to participate in future wars seems to have been temporarily abandoned, and the focus is on the organization of the mainland defense, and it is believed that the mainland defense is mainly in the air force. Therefore, the plan to reorganize the armaments also focuses on the air force the most. It can be clearly seen from the current plan being carried out this year that it stipulates the addition of several squadrons of aircraft and the construction of several airfields.

<h3>Berlin Shocked</h3>
<p>[Berlin] After British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday, announcing the issuance of £400 million in national defense bonds, people here were generally shocked. All newspapers published this news on the front page, and deeply regarded "Britain's adoption of such an unprecedented armament expansion policy in peacetime as unusual." However, it was believed that after the Washington Naval Treaty expired at the end of last year, Britain had new responsibilities in the Pacific, and the country had to expand its armaments. The German General News Report listed the defense works recently built by the government of the British Empire in the country, Gibraltar, Alexandria, Cyprus, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, and quoted General Weygand, the former Chief of Staff of the French Army, as saying, "A great power must have a strong army in order to meet the needs of its policies." What kind of policy does Britain want to adopt with this strong army? Since last December, Britain has been working closely with France, and the two countries' general staffs are conducting talks, which is indeed doubtful. In short, Germany is not responsible for this decision by Britain. As for the news carried by American newspapers that British officials fear the threat of Germany and Japan more than the threat of the Soviet Union, it is even more incredible. In addition, the local Guidance Report believes that this decision by Britain further proves the legitimacy of Germany's reorganization of armaments. (12th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Colonial Demands</h3>
<p>German Ambassador Visits British Foreign Office to Explain Reasons　As Preliminary Preparation for Future Negotiations</p>
<p>[Berlin] German Ambassador to the United Kingdom General Ribbentrop visited Acting Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax at the British Foreign Office yesterday, and it was reported that it was related to the recovery of Germany's former colonies. The German ambassador asked the British government to consider recognizing Germany's demands in principle. British officials now regard this action by the German ambassador as the first formal step towards the biggest goal of the National Socialist Party, which is to recognize the full return of the land ruled by Germany in 1914. It is generally believed that this issue may not be easily resolved in a short period of time. It was also reported that the German ambassador did not submit any memorandum. (Central News Agency, London, Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Content of the Talk</h3>
<p>[London] German Ambassador Ribbentrop visited Acting Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax at the Foreign Office at 4:00 PM today. The talk did not end until 6:12 PM. When entering and leaving, he saluted in the style of the National Socialist Party. Regarding the content of the talk, officials only said, "The two discussed many issues, and Ribbentrop stated the views of the German government." It is generally believed that the content of the talk was kept confidential at Ribbentrop's request. Informed sources said that Ribbentrop explained the reasons for Germany's aspirations regarding the colonial issue and refuted the British objections one by one, but did not make any specific demands. It is likely that he will submit them after Foreign Secretary Eden returns from vacation. It is rumored that Lord Halifax's attitude is more favorable to Germany, and Germany intends to use Halifax to oppose Eden. Germany wants to prove that this is not true, so it does not intend to make specific demands for the time being. Ribbentrop first explained today that whether Germany has colonies is of great economic significance. Secondly, he stated that if Germany had colonies in Africa, it would not pose any threat to the British Empire, and claimed that the moral arguments contained in the Treaty of Versailles, which were used to deprive Germany of its colonies, were of no value. It is heard that Lord Halifax has learned that Germany's desire to recover its old colonies in terms of territory is hopeless, but it is possible to discuss obtaining some rights in economic terms.</p>
<p>In addition, Ribbentrop explained Germany's foreign policy:</p>
<p>㊀ Regarding the mutual assistance treaty between France and Russia, Ribbentrop stated that Germany still objects to it, and said that the two signatory countries retain the right to designate the aggressor, which contradicts Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. The reason why Germany is hesitant to participate in the disarmament convention or the sky convention is also because of this.</p>
<p>㊁ Regarding the issue of Central Europe, especially the issue of German minorities in the Czech Republic, the Free City of Danzig, and the Memel Territory, Ribbentrop explained that if these minorities can obtain a position that can make Germany feel satisfied, and Germany monitors the implementation of this system, then Germany is very willing to resolve peacefully and does not intend to use this as an excuse for enlightenment.</p>
<p>㊂ Regarding Germany's four-year economic plan, Ribbentrop explained that this plan does not mean that Germany is economically isolated. Its focus is on the supply of raw materials, such as oil, cotton, and rubber. Germany is not opposed to economic international cooperation, but the economic cooperation methods proposed by various countries so far are either vague or have the form of usurious loans, which Germany cannot accept. From Germany's observation, if the current import tax rates of various countries can be reduced, it will be of great benefit to economic cooperation, but this is still difficult to implement. As far as it is generally known, Lord Halifax did not speak much during today's talk and asked few questions, but only listened to Ribbentrop's opinions and promised to convey them to the cabinet. As for the progress of the talk, it can be summed up in one sentence, that is, Ribbentrop explained Germany's views as preliminary preparation for long-term negotiations in the future.

<h3>Close Cooperation Between Britain and France Cannot Be Separated by Germany</h3>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the situation of the talks between German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop and British Acting Foreign Secretary Halifax, the British government has notified the French government. People in the government here recently commented that the mutual cooperation between Britain and France is of great benefit to the international peace cause based on the League of Nations. If German foreign policy aims to separate Britain and France and prevent them from continuing to cooperate, it will definitely not succeed, because the governments of Britain and France have already decided to consult each other before adopting any resolutions. Political figures also said that the governments of Britain and France have jointly decided to continue to expand their armaments, which is not only sufficient to protect the security of each country, but also a strong guarantee for the current borders of Central Europe and Eastern Europe. As for the matter of Germany's request to restore its old colonies, political figures here generally believe that Britain and France have no intention of ceding any colonies to Germany in Africa or elsewhere. For example, Senator Lange, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, published an article in the Economic and Financial Communications Newspaper, stating briefly, "If Germany expects to succeed in what it failed in 1914, and even does not hesitate to resort to force, then all democratic countries will definitely unite with arms to maintain peace, as they did in the European War. Germany must understand this." (13th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Reply to the British Note on the Locarno Issue</h3>
<p>Willing to Protect the Security of Its Own Territory　Not Obligated to Assist Other Countries</p>
<p>Brussels According to the meaning contained in Belgium's reply to Britain's November 4 Locarno note, Belgium is not yet willing to promise France any assistance if France is attacked by Germany, and therefore still wants to maintain the neutral attitude previously announced by Belgian King Leopold. In any new Locarno Treaty, Belgium only wants its own security to be guaranteed and does not want to assume the responsibility of guaranteeing the security of other countries, because Belgium has done its duty if it can protect the security of its own borders.

<h3>Japanese Diet Reconvenes Tomorrow, Government's Difficulties Can Be Overcome</h3>
<p>Seeking the Complete Establishment of the Budget Plan　Political Parties Decide to Adopt a Self-Respecting Attitude</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The concrete plan for the revision of the next year's budget and tax increase is the central issue for the government's preparation for the Diet. It has now been finalized. The cabinet meeting on the 13th also formally decided on the Prime Minister's policy and diplomatic speech, the Finance Minister's financial speech, and at the same time prepared other administrative preparations to face the Diet that will reconvene on the 15th. However, this session has been suspended due to the coup, and there are only 39 days left in the session. It is also the first Diet of the Hayashi Cabinet, so the temporary and expedient budget plan and the temporary tax increase plan aimed at addressing the next year's revenue will inevitably be debated from both procedural and substantive aspects. The government is fully vigilant in case of emergency, and takes the establishment of the budget as the first priority, avoids friction with political parties, and takes full coordination as its policy, hoping to overcome the difficulties smoothly. On the one hand, the two parties, Seiyukai and Minseito, will hold a meeting of executive committee members and general meeting of members on the 14th to formally express the party's attitude. Although there are various reactions within the two parties, the general trend has been decided to exercise self-restraint, so it is unlikely that they will adopt a challenging attitude towards the Hirota Cabinet. Since the attitude of the government and political parties is stable and self-restrained, the Diet on the 15th should not cause a storm. However, how the debate surrounding the two proposals of tax increase and budget and the criticism of Prime Minister Hayashi's trust in political parties will develop is worth noting, because the general concern is focused on this.

<h3>Budget Cut by More Than 200 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The budget for the Showa 12th year, decided on the 12th at the Cabinet meeting, was reduced by 269 million yen from the 3.038 billion yen proposed by the previous cabinet, becoming 2.769 billion yen. The details are listed separately below (in units of 10,000 yen): Imperial Household Expenses 45, Ministry of Foreign Affairs 330, Ministry of Home Affairs 2,610, Ministry of Finance 5,450, Ministry of the Army 7,040, Ministry of the Navy 6,580, Ministry of Justice 420, Ministry of Education 1,450, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 1,150, Ministry of Commerce and Industry 260, Ministry of Communications 2,080, Ministry of Colonial Affairs 230, Total 27,694. (12th, Dōmei News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government, at yesterday's Cabinet meeting, decided that the amount to be suspended in next year's budget is 269 million yen. However, of this suspended amount, 46 million yen related to the Army and Navy will be handled only as a matter of understanding within the government. When submitting the budget to the Diet, both the Army and Navy budgets will be submitted with the expenditure budget decided by the previous cabinet, without any amendments, requesting approval. However, how the budgets of each ministry other than the Army and Navy will be formally handled remains to be thoroughly studied in the future. This kind of budget handling is unprecedented, and there will definitely be considerable debate in the Diet. (13th, Dōmei News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The revised tax increase plan is estimated to increase total tax revenue by approximately 290 million yen. The details are as follows: domestic national debt approximately 268 million yen, customs duties 18 million yen, export control tax 4 million yen. Judging from the above situation, the customs duties increased by the Baba proposal amount to approximately 460 million yen. Compared to this, it is estimated that 170 million yen has been reduced.

<h3>General Sugiyama Succeeds as Army Minister</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Lieutenant General Kōtarō Nakamura, the Army Minister, resigned due to illness, and former Army Minister Terauchi was appointed as the Inspector General of Education. The Army believes that Sugiyama's appointment as Army Minister is appropriate and suitable, and the entire Army supports it. The Hayashi Cabinet, which was once on the verge of collapse due to the Army's recommendation problem, will undergo a major change in its relationship with the Army due to the appointment of Army Minister Sugiyama. In this sense, the change of Army Minister can make the relationship between the Hayashi Cabinet and the Army even closer. As a result, it is tantamount to strengthening the Hayashi Cabinet. Conversely, the Army's wishes can be made clearer and more powerful through the new Army Minister. The Hayashi Cabinet's reform policies will be further promoted as a result.

<h3>Goebbels' Speech Against Communism</h3>
<p>Refusing the Westward Spread of Red Power, Recognizing the Impossibility of a European War</p>
<p>[Berlin] Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered an important political speech today at the "German Hall" to 20,000 members of the National Socialist Party, stating briefly, "Our enemies once falsely claimed that once we seized power, French troops would once again be stationed in the Rhineland region, but this statement ultimately did not become a reality. I also dare to say that France no longer has the idea of occupying the Ruhr mining area again. Since we have been in power, we have completed the reorganization of military preparations and torn up the Treaty of Versailles into pieces, throwing it in the face of the enemy to prove its absurdity." Regarding the Spanish problem, he said, "Bolshevism wants to implement its strategy in Western Europe and Spain, which we will never allow." Goebbels then described Germany's relations with Japan and the Balkan countries, and attacked the Roman Catholic Church, saying, "As far as I know, the Red government of Valencia in Spain has a representative stationed in the Vatican, while the National Government led by General Franco does not. This is quite thought-provoking... What position does the Christian Church occupy in the anti-Bolshevik struggle?" He then discussed war rumors, saying, "War will not break out. Führer Hitler has shaken hands with the French nation. We have no territorial demands on France." Finally, regarding the Moroccan issue, he said that all kinds of news (referring to news of German activities in Spanish Morocco) were issued by Moscow "and spread by newspapers in Paris. We should immediately counterattack to prove its falsity. In short, Moscow intends to plunge Europe into chaos, which we must prevent. This is what we can clearly state," he said.

<h3>Portuguese Government Rejects Inspection Plan</h3>
<p>The Work of the Adjustment Committee Encounters Serious Difficulties Again</p>
<p>[London] The Subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee for the Non-Intervention Plan in the Spanish Civil War continued to meet at the Foreign Office at 11:00 AM today. In addition to the British, French, German, Italian, Russian, and Portuguese ambassadors to the UK, military and naval experts from each country also attended. The Portuguese representative had already refused to accept the Spanish land inspection plan because it involved the Portuguese border. According to sources familiar with the matter, the Portuguese representative this morning also refused to accept the sea inspection plan because it involved Portuguese ports. Therefore, the ambassadors and military and naval experts of all countries believe that the efforts of the Adjustment Committee have encountered serious difficulties. (12th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Since the Portuguese government has refused to accept both the Spanish land and sea inspection plans, the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee currently has only two options: one is to admit that the inspection system cannot be implemented and abandon it, and the other is to decide to implement inspection in the high seas outside the territorial waters of Spain and Portugal to avoid conducting inspections within Portuguese territory and territorial waters. However, the second method equates Spain and Portugal, which is bound to encounter various obstacles that cannot be overcome. (12th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Spanish Civil War Has Reached a Critical Stage</h3>
<p>Both Sides Fight for the Avenue to the New Capital, Government Forces in Southern Capital Win Counterattack</p>
<p>The Spanish Civil War has now entered its seventh month. The port of Málaga in the south was occupied by rebel forces on the 8th of this month. The gain or loss of this port is of strategic importance, as the rebel forces can disrupt transportation to Valencia and Alicante, cut off supplies to the government forces from the Atlantic, and allow for free and unhindered communication between the mainland and Morocco.</p>
<p>Madrid: The avenue to Valencia is the lifeline of the capital. The two sides are attacking each other 12 miles southeast of the capital to fight for control of this road. Therefore, the Spanish Civil War has now reached a critical stage. The focus of the battle is currently on the Jarama River. Both sides have densely deployed various mechanized units on both sides of the river. The Spanish government insists that government forces have recaptured the small mountains overlooking the road, so the road is not yet free from the bombardment of Nationalist artillery, but machine guns cannot reach it. The government also admits that both sides suffered heavy losses in this battle, mostly due to the use of mechanized tactics. The Nationalist headquarters in Salamanca claims that Nationalist forces on the Madrid front buried 1,800 enemy corpses this week. It also claims that Nationalist cavalry still occupies several miles of the Valencia Avenue. Government forces launched a counterattack yesterday with 27 tanks, hoping to prevent Nationalist forces from consolidating their positions on the right bank of the Jarama, but were driven back by Nationalist forces. (13th, Reuters, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Madrid: The Defense Committee issued a statement today stating that government forces have been launching a counterattack in the Jarama River area south of the capital for the past 24 hours, repelling Moroccan cavalry belonging to the rebel forces and mechanized units composed of Germans, and recovering many important strategic locations in the highlands near Valencia Avenue and the Bahlales Mountains. In addition, rebel forces on the northeastern front of Guadarajara also launched a fierce attack but were defeated head-on by government forces, with rebel casualties reaching as many as 250. (13th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Madrid: Although the Spanish Nationalist forces claim that they will wage a final battle to seize Madrid, the Spanish government forces are now preparing a major counterattack to repel the Nationalist forces advancing on the capital. The Madrid garrison has called for a general mobilization and stated that the loss of Málaga should not discourage the fighting spirit of the government forces. Government forces say they still control the avenue from Madrid to Valencia, but vehicles must detour because the road has been threatened by enemy artillery. Life in local villages and towns remains as usual. Women are sitting outdoors today, breathing fresh air, and young girls smile carefree as they go to the wells to fetch water. However, the rumble of artillery is incessant, mixed with the laughter of women. The tranquility of life in this area is evident. (13th, Reuters, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Hendaye: It was learned today that General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, has withdrawn 30,000 troops from Málaga. Some have been transferred to Córdoba to prevent government forces from launching an offensive, and some have been transferred to the Madrid front to prepare for a new offensive. According to government forces' news received from the border, the Nationalist forces in Córdoba are currently in a dangerous situation. Government forces now occupy Algory, which is only five miles from Córdoba. Government forces in the Sierra Nevada region are also mobilizing, preparing to impede the advance of General Ranno's troops. (12th, Guomin News)</p>

<h3>US Shipbuilding Program Comes to a Standstill</h3>
<p>Due to a Severe Shortage of Steel</p>
<p>[Washington] It was learned today that the construction of six new destroyers and three new submarines, which account for half of the US's shipbuilding program this year, has come to a standstill due to a severe shortage of steel. The steel shortage is due to a dispute between the US government and industrialists. It is reported that copper and steel manufacturers have stopped supplying the Navy Department with the steel it needs in order to oppose the Walsh-Healey Act, which stipulates a 40-hour work week and sets certain labor treatment regulations for factories that meet government needs. When steel mills worked 48 hours a week, the output was not enough to meet demand, so they all refused to reduce the weekly working hours to 40 hours just for the sake of supplying government orders, because government orders are a very small number compared to those placed by private individuals. It is reported that the Navy Department currently needs at least 25 million pounds of steel, but the steel mills have no intention of accepting government orders. If the Navy Department builds one or two 35,000-ton battleships, the amount of steel needed will be even greater. (12th, Reuters, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Balkan Four-Nation Political Conference</h3>
<p>To Be Held in Athens Soon, Romanian Foreign Minister Explains Diplomatic Strategy</p>
<p>Athens: The Standing Political Conference of the Balkan Entente countries will be held here soon. Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu set off today for the capital of Yugoslavia, Belgrade, to meet with Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović.

The Greek government has now sent representatives to the border to welcome the foreign ministers of the three countries. In addition, the Balkan Entente countries' press conference will also be held here at the same time. (13th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital: Foreign Minister Antonescu gave a speech in the Senate last night, stating briefly that since King Carol of Romania visited the capital of Czechoslovakia, the alliance between Romania and Czechoslovakia has become stronger. Since Foreign Minister Antonescu traveled to Poland, the alliance between Romania and Poland has become closer. When he visited Paris, French Foreign Minister Delbos also repeatedly assured that the friendship between France and Romania would never be interrupted. In addition, Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović has visited Romania several times, which is enough to prove the close ties between Romania and Yugoslavia. As for Romania's relationship with the Soviet Union, it has always been very good and continues to develop in an atmosphere of genuine friendship. Even if there are occasional small incidents, they are not enough to hinder the relationship between the two countries. Is there any reason to say that Romania's understanding with the Soviet Union has been threatened? Finally, the Foreign Minister strongly stated that the government will continue to pursue Romania's traditional diplomatic policy. (13th, Havas News Agency)</p>

<h3>Huitong Company, Which Manages Sino-Japanese Air Transportation, Actively Expands</h3>
<p>Tianjin-Tokyo Joint Flights to Be Realized on March 1st, New Tianjin-Harbin Route Planned with Daily Flights, Japanese Military Aircraft Still Constantly Traveling Back and Forth in Hebei and Chahar</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Huitong Airlines, which manages Sino-Japanese air transportation in Hebei and Chahar, has a capital of 5.4 million yuan, with China and Japan each contributing half. Currently, only 1.35 million yuan has been collected. When the Japanese side initially proposed to the Hebei-Chahar authorities to jointly establish Huitong Company, it was agreed that after the air transportation was opened, Japanese military aircraft would no longer fly in Hebei and Chahar. However, after Huitong Company opened for business, the Japanese side went back on its word. The military aircraft are still constantly traveling back and forth in the skies of Hebei and Chahar. The Hebei-Chahar Foreign Affairs Committee has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side, but without success. Therefore, Zhang Yunrong, who was in charge of preparing for Sino-Japanese air transportation on the Chinese side, resigned as chairman of Huitong Company. Zhang Zizhong, the successor chairman, has taken office, but has not officially started work. The company is nominally a Sino-Japanese joint venture, but the actual power is in the hands of Vice Chairman Tsuneo Kodama (Japanese). All routine matters are fully controlled by the General Affairs Section Chief Higuchi (Japanese). The Japanese side has recently proposed to the Hebei-Chahar authorities to increase capital in order to expand. The Chinese side is studying and considering this and has not yet agreed.</p>
<p>The company's recent plans also include the decision to open a Tianjin-Harbin route to facilitate the travel of Japanese military personnel in and out of customs. Because Harbin is under the jurisdiction of Manchukuo, the Japanese side plans to have Daito Company come forward to undertake the project. Tsuneo Kodama, Vice Chairman of Huitong Company, went to Changchun last month to discuss everything with the heads of the Japanese Kwantung Army for this matter. The principles have been largely decided. It is planned to have one flight per day initially, with a fare of about 90 yuan. After the route opens, new eight-seat AB-type large aircraft ordered from the Nakajima factory in Japan will be used for flights, with stops at Shanhaiguan, Jinzhou, Changchun, and three other stations. One of the three new aircraft ordered has already arrived in Hankou.</p>
<p>It is found that of the four routes currently operated by the company, only the Tianjin-Dalian route is occasionally taken by Chinese people. The rest are only used by Japanese soldiers. However, the company has recently handled Tianjin-Dalian and Dalian-Tokyo joint flights. All procedures have been prepared. Currently, it takes about two hours to fly from Tianjin to Dalian and a total of four hours from Dalian to Tokyo. If the joint flights are successful, it will be possible to arrive from Tianjin to Tokyo in the evening after departing in the morning. According to Yao Zuoshi, head of the business section of the company, the Tianjin-Dalian and Dalian-Tokyo joint flights can be implemented on March 1st if there are no special problems. As for the matter of transporting mail and packages by plane in and out of customs, there is only a proposal, as the problem is complex and must first be negotiated by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. It will not be easy to achieve in the near future.</p>
<p>According to Huitong Company's internal organization, there is originally a training section. After negotiations between the Japanese and Chinese sides, it was agreed that after the official opening of business, an aviation pilot training class would be organized to recruit and train students, regardless of Japanese or Chinese nationality, in order to cultivate talent. However, this has been delayed and delayed, and the aviation training class has not yet been organized. It has recently been decided to suspend it, as the organization of the training class was never the original intention of the Japanese side, but only a pretext for facilitating negotiations. In addition, for publicity purposes, the company is planning sightseeing flights over Tianjin, scheduled to take place every Thursday morning at 10:00 AM from the 10th of this month to the end of the month, touring the entire city for 15 minutes. The fare is five yuan for adults and half price for children. Ticket sales have now begun.</p>
<h3>Social and Economic Situation in Guangdong Province in the Past Year</h3>
<p>Currency Inflation, Silver Gradually Concentrated, Prices of All Commodities Soar, People's Purchasing Power Weak, Commercial Businesses Feeling the Difference Between Then and Now</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The social economy and various commercial businesses in Guangdong Province in the past year have suffered due to the inflexibility of social finance, the continuous issuance of Guangdong currency, the gradual concentration of silver in the official treasury, and the rising prices of goods. Not only has the price of rice soared, but all daily necessities, as well as oil, salt, firewood, and charcoal, are more than twice as expensive as usual. The main reason is currency inflation. Goods that were normally based on silver are now at least 20% more expensive because the government buys silver and exchanges it for paper money at a rate of two to one. Therefore, goods that normally cost one yuan now require 1.2 yuan to purchase. The excessively high exchange rate between Guangdong fractional currency and national currency (silver dollars) (a ratio of 1.5 to 1, i.e., 1.5 yuan of Guangdong fractional currency equals one yuan of national currency) is also a factor in the recent increase in the cost of living in Guangdong Province. Goods in Guangdong that are supplied from neighboring provinces are all purchased on a silver dollar basis. Now the silver dollar exchange rate is as high as 1.5 to 1, which not only makes the Cantonese people feel the pain of expensive domestic goods, but also greatly impacts the sales of domestic goods entering Guangdong.</p>
<p>In the past year, the authorities have vigorously purchased silver. Silver has now disappeared in the urban areas, but in the counties and towns, because the villagers are accustomed to saving and hoarding cash, it is all in silver, which is not easy to circulate for a while. In order to absorb as much as possible, the authorities have entrusted the postal offices in various townships to collect silver on their behalf. At first, the amount collected was still small, but as the Lunar New Year approached, the villagers began to sell all their stored silver to make a living for the year. As a result, the amount of silver collected by postal offices in various places suddenly increased. At the same time, fractional currency circulating in the countryside is also rampant, and the trend of prices rising by 20% is inevitable. However, with the prices of goods expensive, the wages earned by hardworking farmers and workers have not increased. On the one hand, the remuneration remains the same, and on the other hand, the consumption suddenly increases. Therefore, those who earn a living by labor cannot support their parents and raise their children. Their hardship is difficult to describe. Also, because the authorities are working hard to absorb silver and need a lot of fractional currency, the provincial bank has issued 14 million yuan of new fractional currency in recent months, as far as is known. It is said that it is still being issued this month for the purpose of purchasing silver.</p>
<p>Less than 30-40% of commercial businesses can make a profit. Due to the high cost of raw materials, the cost of industrial products is also high. For example, ordinary socks, which normally cost only 20 cents per pair, have recently risen to 25 cents per pair, which hinders sales. The same is true for knitted clothing. Machine-made calico has been greatly reduced in sales due to export tax and unified tax. Therefore, in the past year, most handicrafts have suffered losses. Recently, there has been a rice shortage in the province, and the price of rice has soared. It is difficult for the middle class to maintain two meals a day, so there is no extra money for miscellaneous food. Therefore, most of the tea houses and restaurants that were once prosperous are not doing well. More than a dozen large tea houses closed at the end of last year, and many large restaurants also closed down. The business of so-called grand hotels is also struggling, and in reality, there is no profit to be made. As for rice bran businesses, due to the influence of expensive rice, those who normally store rice stones have a slight profit. However, after the price of rice is expensive, the purchased rice is lost during the grinding process, and there is no large profit to be made. As for the candy, seafood, cured meat, paper goods, firecracker, oil bean, clothing, and shoe industries, which are usually busy at the end of the year, the business at the end of the year is less than 50-60% of the previous year. As for the antique business, which is only for the leisure of the idle class, even fewer people are interested. People's purchasing power is weak, and the trend is getting worse and worse. Those who are concerned about the social and economic situation are all worried about this. (February 10th)</p>
<h3>Excellent Phenomena of General Account Closing in Fuzhou's Commercial Market</h3>
<p>All Shops Can Clear Accounts; Most Qian Zhuang (Native Banks) Repayments Also Completed</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: In this city's commercial market, the goods sold by shops, except for those with strong capital who can purchase with cash and obtain particularly low prices, are mostly sold with payments in installments, ranging from sixty days or more to one hundred days. The trade guilds add interest to the price depending on the length of the term. During the year-end general account closing period according to the lunar calendar, all accounts must be settled and cleared. However, for goods wholesaled by the trade guilds one or two months before the general account closing, it is considered "over the year" goods, and the first installment is collected only on the second day of the second lunar month. During this period, the funds from sales can be used to manage and repay old debts, so the second day of the second lunar month is the first difficult hurdle for the commercial market, and the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth lunar month is the last difficult hurdle. This day is the general settlement of all goods payments for the entire year, requiring the repayment of approximately 90% of the loans, with the remaining 10% to be repaid by the twenty-eighth day. The sixth day of this month was the last difficult hurdle for the Fuzhou commercial market. Because the sales of various specialty products such as tea, wood, paper, and bamboo shoots were very good last year, increasing by about one-half to two-thirds compared to previous years, the financial market was quite active. Although the request for loans of five million yuan from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to alleviate the lunar New Year financial strain was not approved, all businesses were still able to repay the debts as scheduled, and no bankruptcies occurred. By the twenty-eighth day of the lunar month (i.e., the ninth day), the remaining small amounts were settled, and no problems arose. As for the loans that shops borrowed from the Qian Zhuang (native banks), although they must be settled during the general account closing period, those with strong capital successively deposit funds to repay the debts during the twelfth lunar month. The latest is around the time of the Kitchen God festival; after this, they are considered "lower-tier" clients, and the Qian Zhuang will have to consider and require guarantees when sending statements next year in the remaining spring season. However, in the past when the Qian Zhuang were prosperous, shops often issued "year-end term bills" to Qian Zhuang A to repay debts to Qian Zhuang B, and issued "year-end term bills" to Qian Zhuang B to repay debts to Qian Zhuang C. Now that there are only a few Qian Zhuang, the above method is difficult to achieve. If there is no relief measure, it will inevitably lead to bankruptcies. Therefore, in recent years, Qian Zhuang have come up with a flexible solution: if a shop has difficulty with financial stagnation, the amount owed on the statement can be rounded off into a whole number and converted into a term bill. At the end of the lunar year, only interest needs to be paid, and the principal can be repaid in the coming spring. However, last year, all export goods showed improvement, and the funds remitted back during the year-end were considerable. Most businesses have already repaid their debts to the Qian Zhuang. Those who had difficulty making up for business losses in previous years or had special circumstances were also allowed to convert their debts into term bills to maintain the status quo and overcome the difficulties.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Burglary at the Dianyie Bank (Pawn Banking)</p>
<p>The Dianyie Bank in this city has been open for many years and has had very good business. It was closed for the Spring Festival holiday, and on the first day of the holiday, i.e., New Year's Day of the lunar calendar, a burglary suddenly occurred. The next morning, the back door was found wide open. After the staff reported it to the authorities, they all began to investigate and found that the iron clamps of the vault were twisted off. The silver dollars in the vault, which were always placed in another small box, were all gone without a trace, leaving an empty box. The banknotes were scattered in disarray. After checking the losses, it was estimated that 3,000 silver dollars and over 4,000 paper dollars were stolen. The local government dispatched detectives to investigate and, together with the staff, inspected the scene. It was determined that the thief was definitely not a person and escaped from the back door, but there were no clues to be found regarding the path of entry. It was said that solving the case would require a lot of research. The police authorities are now conducting a strict investigation and intensifying patrols.</p>
<p>Heavy Snowfall in Songjiang Yesterday</p>
<p>The temperature in this city dropped sharply on the 12th, and it was very cold. At noon, heavy snow suddenly began to fall and stopped only in the evening. Followed by a northern wind, thick ice formed everywhere. It was unprecedented since last winter.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Murder and Body Disposal in Shigang Township</p>
<p>Zhu, from Xiaozhai Village, Shigang Township, First District, took Fang Tai, the younger brother from Qingqiao Village, as her husband. Zhu was promiscuous and had more than one lover. On the night of the 5th, she and her lover strangled her husband to death and threw the body under the east side of the Lujia Bridge, intending to claim that he had fallen into the river and drowned in order to cover up her crime. Unexpectedly, in a moment of mental confusion, only the feet were in the water, and most of the body remained on land. The next morning, passersby saw it and ran to tell Zhu, but she did not recognize it as her husband, which only made things worse. The villagers were already convinced that Zhu had committed murder based on the above two pieces of evidence. The Baojia chief, while monitoring Zhu, reported it to the county government. The county government sent an inspector on the 6th for an autopsy, which only revealed a minor injury to the throat. After Zhu was taken to the county, she was soon released on bail, and the deceased's family made a great uproar. The deceased's mother, Ye Hu, led more than twenty people to express their dissatisfaction. Chen Youmin, the chief of the county police bureau, based on the report from the Malu branch station in the area, personally went to the township on the 8th to investigate and learned all the facts. Ye Hu also identified the lover who committed the crime as Zhou Yaoren from the same township. The police were immediately ordered to arrest him, but he had already fled. The obtained evidence was prepared in a document and sent to the county along with Zhu for investigation and handling.</p>
<p>Most Commercial Accounts Were Profitable</p>
<p>Last year's autumn harvest was good, and the social economy showed a slight turnaround. Prices of all goods tended to rise, and the development of commerce was unprecedented in the past five years. Most industries made profits. The Jiafeng Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, established at the beginning, had a good opportunity. Although it suffered some losses by selling a portion of its products in advance, the result was a profit of 300,000 yuan. The next best were the cotton and foreign goods industries, which also made considerable profits. However, the banking industry, due to the difficulty in issuing loans, was unable to fully expand its business, and its profits were not as abundant as those of other industries.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Bribery Case in Re-examination of Drug Addicts</p>
<p>Gao Zhongliang, from Zhengyi Town, Seventh District of the county, was reported to have relapsed into opium addiction during the general re-examination of drug addicts. He was arrested by the local police station and sent to the county government, which transferred him to the county hospital for re-examination. Gao was terrified and secretly discussed bribing with Yuan Kegong and Xue A'gen, a carriage driver at the hospital, and handed over 200 yuan in legal tender. Unexpectedly, the hospital's re-examination result was that he was addicted but had no drugs in his system. He was sent to the county for legal handling. Gao then confessed the whole story. Peng, the county magistrate, was furious at the carriage driver Xue A'gen's audacity and immediately ordered his arrest and detention. Yuan Kegong and Wang Picheng, who were also involved, were also arrested. It is said that the inside story of the case is complicated, and a strict investigation is currently underway, and they will be severely punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Progress of Street Widening</p>
<p>The authorities have decided to borrow 300,000 yuan from a consortium of banks to implement the Suzhou street widening plan. However, local people pointed out that during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, 180,000 yuan of local construction funds from Wu County were borrowed by the provincial government to build defense works. It is now proposed to recover this debt from the provincial government to offset this loan. Magistrate Deng has reported this matter to Chairman Chen. Chen believes that Suzhou streets urgently need comprehensive planning, and all streets that should be widened should be widened. Not only can the 180,000 yuan be returned to the locality, but the province will also allocate half of the Suzhou land price tax, which is over 100,000 yuan annually, for nearly five years to be fully used for Wu County's construction expenses, totaling 500,000 yuan. A Suzhou Municipal Engineering Office will be established to specialize in planning Suzhou's construction.</p>
<p>Yongsheng Qian Zhuang (Native Bank) Closes</p>
<p>Yongsheng, a large Qian Zhuang (native bank) in Suzhou with the "Fu" character, closed at the end of the lunar year because the business scope of Qian Zhuang has been narrowing in recent years and there is little hope for the future. The major shareholders of the Zhuang are Wang and Yu, who are currently handling all debts owed and owed to others.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Good Harvest for All Industries in General Account Closing</p>
<p>The general account closing period for this year has ended, and businesses are now in a period of rest. Most have not officially reopened. Regarding profits and losses, statistics have not yet been compiled. However, according to the merchants, the account collection has been very good due to the bumper autumn harvest. The accounts in the urban and suburban areas have had excellent results, with a total income of about 80-90%. Although the rural accounts benefited from the abundant autumn harvest, the farmers have accumulated losses over the years and have not yet recovered. Fortunately, there are very few rural accounts, so the impact is not significant. Based on the above situation, all industries have made profits. After celebrating the God of Wealth Festival on the fifth day of the lunar New Year, all businesses will fully reopen.</p>
<p>Spring Cold Damages Wheat Crops</p>
<p>Since winter, there have been three snowfalls here, but it has not been severely cold. The Celsius temperature has often exceeded forty degrees. Unexpectedly, recently, as spring has arrived, the weather has suddenly changed. Rain and snow have been falling intermittently since the 10th, and it snowed all day on the 12th. Although it has cleared up on the 13th, the spring cold is very severe. The Fahrenheit temperature has dropped sharply to twenty-eight degrees, so solid ice can be seen everywhere. According to the villagers, this kind of spring snow and spring cold is very unfavorable for wheat in the fields, and the wheat roots will rot, resulting in a poor harvest.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Spring Snow Flies in the County</p>
<p>There has been little rain and snow in the county since last winter, and the weather has been dry. Until the day before yesterday, the sky was overcast, and then heavy rain began to pour down. Soon after, a northwest wind rose sharply, and the weather turned cold. Spring snow flew with the wind and stopped slightly around 5 p.m., accumulating four or five inches of snow. On the morning of the 13th, the sun shone brightly, causing the ice and snow to gradually melt. This is greatly beneficial to agricultural crops and can also reduce folk diseases.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Rural Harvest and Stable Commerce</p>
<p>Jiangyin industries conducted general account closing on the 10th. Due to the improvement in the rural economy last year, all industries showed improvement, and account collection reached 80-90%. All land rents were fully collected, and even old rents were paid off. Among the industries, the silver and money industry made the most profit, followed by cotton cloth, cotton yarn, coal, rice, and silk cloth, with full profits. Only the Liyi yarn factory suffered a loss of 50,000-60,000 yuan because the former manager, Wang Jiyun, sold 100,000 bales of cotton yarn when the Sino-Japanese negotiations were tense. Otherwise, the business would have been very successful. The Huacheng cloth factory is planning to add machines and expand. The Yuandetang West shop on Dongda Street is rumored to be closing down due to too many debts and insufficient turnover.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>All Industries Profited in General Account Closing</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, Wuyi industries have been in a state of recession for many years, with losses and no gains, and many shops have closed down as a result. In 1936, the four rural areas had abundant agricultural and animal husbandry products, and the silk and ramie harvests in spring and summer were also good. The farmers' purchasing power increased slightly, and the business of various industries also improved as a result. Last winter, the prices of goods suddenly rose, and business became even more prosperous. Therefore, by the time of the general account closing period, all shops and factories, large and small, had made profits. This phenomenon can be said to be unprecedented in many years. Among the industries, the yarn and cloth factories made the most profit. The Dacheng Yarn Factory made a profit of nearly two million and will add a third factory this year. The Minfeng Yarn Factory also made a profit of several hundred thousand. The cloth factories made tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. The Shanghai and Wujin banks made the most profit in the banking industry, followed by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Guohua. Among the silk cloth industries, Tian Guancha and Renhe made the most profit. In addition, the Hengfeng Flour Mill and various oil factories made considerable profits. The foreign and Guang goods industry, yarn and flower industry, and copper and iron industry also had profits due to the increase in commodity prices. Therefore, all industries were overjoyed.</p>
<h3>Nantung</h3>
<p>Overview of General Account Closing for All Industries</p>
<p>In the general account closing at the end of the lunar year in Tung County, the yarn industry was the most successful. All factories and large and small firms made profits. The native cloth, sundries, and food industries were next. The foreign goods industry made profits due to the increase in commodity prices after autumn. The cotton industry suffered losses due to abnormal market conditions. The salt reclamation industry suffered heavy losses due to the poor cotton harvest.</p>
<p>There are Many Drug Addicts in Tung County</p>
<p>The six counties in Tung County conducted a general re-examination of drug addicts. After 40 days of door-to-door investigation, nearly 10,000 male and female addicts were found, resulting in the temples in the urban and suburban areas being converted into temporary detention centers. Drug addict factories have been expanded to accommodate them. Before February 20th, the Baojia chiefs are still responsible for reporting.</p>

<h3>Maritime Organizations Send Telegram to Zhang and Yang</h3>
<p>Offering Four Points</p>
<p>Maritime organizations sent a telegram to Zhang Hanqing in Nanjing and Yang Hucheng in Xi'an, to be forwarded to all their generals, saying: "Gentlemen, the Central Government has generously dealt with the aftermath of Shaanxi and Gansu, giving an opportunity to start anew amidst the rectification of discipline. Although you were confused by exaggerations and hesitated to obey orders, you were ultimately moved by the leader's personality and convinced by the national public opinion. You have repented and the whole country rejoices. As the troops gradually withdraw, we respectfully offer you a humble suggestion: ㊀ The troops are susceptible to the incitement of the Red bandits, and it is difficult to avoid the lingering of evil thoughts among them, which must be eliminated with all efforts to prevent the source of chaos. ㊁ During troop movements, efforts must be made to appease the local people and stabilize the community. ㊂ You and your subordinate troops must absolutely obey the Central Government and strive to serve the country. ㊃ You must vigorously implement the national policy of suppressing bandits, eliminating traitors, resisting foreign aggression, and saving the country. We hope that the above four points will be adopted to comfort the elders in Shaanxi and Gansu and appease the people of the whole country. We express our sincere concern in this telegram.

<h3>The Overall Account Closing Situation of Various Industries in Shanghai is Improving</h3>
<p>Businesses Will Resume as Usual Tomorrow After the Spring Holiday</p>
<p>The silver and money industry and various industrial and commercial industries in this city have been closed for four days during the Spring Festival holiday, as usual, and will resume business tomorrow after the holiday. Last year, due to the abundant agricultural production and the recovery of industry and commerce, the overall account closing of various industries was safely passed, and the financial situation was greatly improved. This is an unprecedented situation in the past five years. According to the records released by the banking industry on the financial situation in the past 23 years:</p>
<p>Financial Stability</p>
<p>Since China was attacked by the global recession, the financial panic was most severe in 1934 and 1935. During the overall account closing period in 1934, a small number of banks and firms were forced to close. In 1935, the degree of financial tension increased daily. Throughout the year, a total of 14 banks in this city closed, with a total capital of over 27 million yuan. A total of 9 exchange firms closed, with a total capital of over 2.1 million yuan. As a result, the government had to adopt emergency relief policies and announced the reform of the currency system on November 4, 1935, and implemented the new currency system. The financial panic gradually subsided. At that time, although prices were temporarily stimulated and increased due to speculation, they eventually returned to normal because various industries had not yet actually recovered. Therefore, the overall account closing period in 1935 was a period of stopping the panic due to the new currency system after the fatigue of previous years. Although the call loan interest rate returned to ease, there were still many rumors in the public debt and foreign exchange markets. The financial industry had just caught its breath and could only be said to be maintaining the status quo. During the overall account closing period last year, the call loan interest rate was relaxed, the foreign exchange rate was stable, the circulation of bills increased, and the prices of public debt securities trended upward. This can be said to be a period of financial stability.</p>
<p>Recovery of Various Industries</p>
<p>The reasons for financial stability during the overall account closing period last year were: ㊀ The financial industry progressed with the recovery of various industries. Domestically, the rural economy recovered due to the abundant agricultural production, so the purchasing power in the interior increased. The sales of daily necessities such as yarn and cloth were widespread and prices rose. Freight increased, and the shipping industry also made profits. Internationally, as the world economy gradually recovered, international commodity prices tended to rise, so domestic commodity prices also rose accordingly. Especially with the world's arms race, the export of domestic military raw materials such as antimony, tungsten, copper, tin, silk, and grain increased, and prices became even more expensive. ㊁ The financial industry itself had previously suffered from excessive investment in real estate, resulting in heavy capital being idle, or engaging in speculation such as bidding, which had an impact. After the turmoil, it has changed to a conservative approach, tightening credit and focusing on mortgage business. Last year, the important loans of various banks belonged to economic construction, such as road construction, electricity, sericulture, fisheries, and agricultural warehouse transportation and sales loans, totaling more than 100 million yuan. This not only consolidated the foundation of the financial industry, but also greatly helped the progress of the national economy. Other factors such as the stability of the central political situation and the strengthening of the government's maintenance forces, although the Suiyuan War, the Southwest Issue, and the Xi'an Incident occurred during the year, the government's policies did not change slightly. It made every effort to maintain international exchange rates, which prevented disasters from taking shape and stabilized people's hearts. Financial stability was not accidental. If more efforts are made this year, the situation should improve further.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Personally Inspects the Neighborhoods on Lunar New Year's Eve</h3>
<p>All Municipal Government Agencies Will Work as Usual on the 11th</p>
<p>It is customary in the Chinese business community to use the end of the lunar year as the account closing period, and the general public also uses the Spring Festival as a time for timely enjoyment. This year's end of the year, due to the improvement in the market and the stability of national affairs, is gradually showing a sign of rejuvenation and prosperity compared to previous years. In order to observe the people's sentiments, Mayor Wu drove to various urban areas of the city on New Year's Eve to inspect them. He was deeply gratified to witness the stability of the neighborhoods and the high spirits of the people preparing to celebrate the Spring Festival. The 11th is the Lunar New Year, and government agencies will work as usual according to custom. In addition to personally handling important official matters at the municipal government, Mayor Wu also visited various important agencies under the municipal government for a week. It is said that the personnel of all agencies are able to do their best in their duties as usual.</p>
<h3>Money Industry Resumes Business Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Some Increase Capital and Reorganize, Some Close Down</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reported that after the various industries handled the overall account closing, the banks and Qian Zhuang (native banks) will resume business tomorrow after a four-day holiday. The Money Industry Association will hold a group worship ceremony at the Northern City Guild Hall at 9 a.m. on the 11th.

<h3>Two China Merchants Bureau Ships Encountered Trouble with Waves Yesterday</h3>
<p>"Xinjiangtian" Arrived in Shanghai; "Haixiang" Temporarily Anchored</p>
<p>The "Xinjiangtian" of the China Merchants Bureau's Ningbo route, which departed from Yong (Ningbo) the day before yesterday and arrived at the mouth of Wusong yesterday morning at dawn, was hit by a fierce northwest wind. The captain, believing that the ship was a scheduled liner and had to arrive on time, risked proceeding. However, the monstrous waves caused the ship to sway violently from side to side. A huge wave crashed over the deck, damaging one end of the bridge. Fortunately, by sailing against the wind, it was able to enter the Huangpu River and arrive safely in Shanghai. The passengers celebrated their good fortune. The damaged bridge was repaired yesterday and departed as usual last night to Yong.</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's "Haixiang" also reported yesterday that when the ship reached the Jiuduan River area in the Tongsha waters, it was suddenly hit by a strong westerly wind. The waves were huge and overwhelming. The captain immediately steered the ship out of the Yangtze River estuary in the fierce wind and waves and anchored to temporarily avoid the storm, waiting for the wind and waves to subside before sailing again.</p>

<h3>The Association for the Recovery of Pilotage Rights Issued a Declaration Yesterday</h3>
<p>Petition Representatives to Go to Beijing Today</p>
<p>The China Seamen's Union, the Shanghai Seamen's Branch, the China Seamen's Party Branch, and various seamen's organizations, for the pilotage rights issue, had previously formed the Chinese Seamen's Committee for Petitioning the Government to Recover Pilotage Rights. Now, the committee has specifically appointed Li Jianbai, Hu Qi, Feng Fu. Cheng, and ten others to go to Beijing today afternoon to petition. Yesterday, they issued a declaration stating: Since the opening of the five treaty ports and the opening of domestic navigation, the pilotage duties for ships entering and exiting various ports along our coast and rivers have gradually been coveted by foreigners. In the seventh year of Tongzhi, Robert Hart, the British customs commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, formulated the General Regulations for Pilotage, allowing foreigners to freely serve as pilots in our ports. Subsequently, Daniel Baugh, the British River Inspector of the Jianghai Customs, further designated the Tongsha pilotage rights to be exclusively managed by foreigners. From this, the guest has usurped the role of the host. Not only have the pilotage duties been mostly occupied by foreigners, but the management rights of pilotage affairs have also been seized by foreigners. Over the decades, the impact and damage our country has suffered in terms of navigation and national defense cannot be expressed in words. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it had the determination to recover pilotage rights. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Pilotage Training Institute was established to cultivate talent. In the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, the Provisional Regulations for Pilotage Management were promulgated, stipulating that each port should be jointly organized by the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of the Navy, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and local chambers of commerce to form a pilotage management committee. Furthermore, any vacancies in the pilotage quota for each port should be filled by Chinese pilots. This is truly the best method for recovering pilotage rights. However, local ports have not yet sent personnel to organize, and a laissez-faire attitude is still adopted towards foreign pilots. Although Shanghai has been established, the power is in the hands of foreign customs officials. Although various ministries have representatives, they are like decorations. The government believes that having foreign officials handle matters would eliminate any obstacles. Who would have known that the opposite is true? Foreign pilots refuse to accept our country's methods because of foreign officials (because foreign pilots believe that they should not help their own kind and work for China. If China really wants to recover pilotage rights, Chinese people should come out and handle it. We are all foreigners, why should we help China?). Therefore, the chairman of the Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee, the British national Carnell, driven by sympathy, changed his policy, abandoned the mission of recovering Tongsha, and instead controlled the practice of Chinese Yangtze River pilots in order to deceive our government and maintain his position. Counting the years since the establishment of the committee, it has neither restrained foreign pilots to make them comply, nor reduced the unemployment of Chinese pilots to make them prosper. Not only is it useless, but it is also harmful to the country. Currently, foreign pilots in various ports have become even more intensified and have expanded more than before. Chinese pilots still live and die on their own, struggling under the guarantee of no government. This proves that entrusting foreign officials to preside over the Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee is definitely ineffective. And our country has many ports. If according to the regulations, each ministry would have one representative, there would have to be dozens of people, and each ministry would not have that many representatives to send. Although the Provisional Regulations for Pilotage are good, there is no mechanism to implement them. What can be done? Therefore, to remedy the situation, the government should revise the aforementioned regulations, abolish the organization of pilotage management committees in various ports, and, based on the Ministry of Communications Organization Law promulgated by the National Government in the 20th year, return the management of all pilotage personnel in the country to the Ministry of Communications. At the same time, the Ministry of Communications should holistically plan to cultivate the next generation of pilotage talent and ensure the stability of the current pilotage personnel, so that their lives are stable and they do not become increasingly desolate. As for the pilotage quota for each port, it must be stipulated according to the current number of Chinese and foreign pilots. If there are any vacancies, they must be filled by Chinese pilot trainees and not by foreign pilots. Only in this way can effective results be achieved. The matter concerns national defense and navigation rights. We earnestly request the unified attention of the people of the country. Our association follows the wishes of seamen nationwide and is organized by seamen's groups from various places. It has now been legally established. In addition to appealing to the central government, we also ask all sectors of the country to advocate and assist in the implementation so as to achieve the goal of management by the Ministry of Communications and to facilitate the recovery of pilotage rights. May national defense be fortunate, may navigation be fortunate. This is our declaration. We respectfully ask for your consideration.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Owners and Pullers Protested Against Rickshaw Reduction and Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>With the Implementation Date of March 1st Approaching, They Requested Negotiations with the Public Works Department to Withdraw the Order</p>
<p>Since the Public Works Department announced its decision on the 20th of this month to reduce the number of rickshaws by lottery, rickshaw owners and pullers have expressed their opposition. It is learned that both parties petitioned yesterday morning separately. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Appeal</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers in the special district, in order to oppose the Public Works Department's reduction of rickshaws, have petitioned various party and government departments, requesting negotiations. At 9:00 am yesterday morning, rickshaw puller representatives Chen Guoliang, Bian Changfa, and Fu Guomin submitted a petition to the Rickshaw Guild, requesting: 1. Organize the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Labor-Capital Joint Office according to law in order to effectively respond. 2. Elect labor-capital and contractor representatives to be responsible for negotiations. 3. Petition party and government agencies to request the Public Works Department to withdraw the order, and not to stop until the goal is achieved. 4. Form a legal team and ask lawyers Wu Chengyu and Wu Kaisheng to negotiate and postpone the lottery. 5. Authorize the office to be responsible for the process. Bao Zhenhuang and others received them and agreed to assist in the negotiations.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Owners' Petition</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Guild held a representative meeting of the five districts the day before yesterday and resolved: 1. Petition the municipal government to raise negotiations. 2. Request the Public Works Department to postpone the implementation for three months. At 9:00 am yesterday morning, representatives Bao Zhenhuang, Zhao Fengshan, Zhu Lujiang, Qiu Jilang, Wang Wentao, and Li Tianchun petitioned the municipal government. Section member Yu Mingde received them and promised to request instructions for handling. They then went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. Section member Wang Binjun received them and promised to find a way to handle the matter immediately. The petition stated: Regarding the petition, the rickshaws operating in the special district of this city have been licensed by your government and the French Concession, and have been operating throughout the city for many years. The guild leadership and rickshaw owners have always strictly adhered to the payment of taxes and government orders, and have never dared to overstep. However, since the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the Public Works Department has used the name of rescuing rickshaw pullers to reform the rickshaws within the concession in order to carry out its economic aggression. The establishment of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee has severely damaged our rickshaw industry. Although various rickshaw owners have compromised and reluctantly made concessions, the Public Works Department has become more aggressive and resolved last year to reduce the number of rickshaws within the concession by 500, effective March 1st of this year. For several months, the guild has argued reasonably and appealed everywhere, but the Public Works Department believes that reducing the number of rickshaws is a proposition advocated by the Western directors, and in order to maintain the prestige of foreigners within the concession, it refuses to withdraw the order. In addition to making further legal efforts, we find that the deadline of February 1st is approaching. If the rickshaw reduction is implemented, not only will the businesses of hundreds of rickshaw owners go bankrupt, but the rickshaw pullers who lose their jobs, along with their families, will amount to about ten thousand people. If this continues, not only will the rickshaw industry be in danger, but it will also be a major hidden danger for the future of society. Therefore, we have specifically appointed representatives to come forward to petition, hoping that you will consider the livelihood of the poor, grant assistance, and negotiate with the Public Works Department of the Public Concession to withdraw the order to reduce the number of rickshaws, so as to preserve the rickshaw industry and maintain livelihoods. We are at the point of desperation.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shijie Went to Guangdong Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Take Office as President of the Bin'an District Court</p>
<p>Professor Zhang Shijie of the Law Department of Shanghai College of Law and Politics has been appointed by the Ministry of Justice as the President of the Bin'an District Court in Guangdong. He took the China Merchants Bureau's "Haizhen" ship to Guangdong yesterday to assume his new post. Zhang has served in the Ministry of Judicial Administration for many years and has held positions such as secretary of the National Government's representative office in France, professor at National Central University, prosecutor of the Zhongshan branch of the Guangzhou District Court, and judge of the Shanghai Second Special District Court. He has extensive experience, and his appointment as the president of the Bin'an District Court this time will surely make even greater contributions.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warship "Izumo" Departs Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese "Shanghai Daily," the Third Fleet flagship "Izumo," commanded by Commander Hasegawa, has departed Shanghai at 11:30 am on the 13th after returning to Shanghai from a cruise in South China.

<h3>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Will Soon Be Fully Open to Traffic</h3>
<p>Passenger Cars Ordered from England Delivered in Shanghai; Vehicle Assembly Submitted to the Ministry of Railways for Approval</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway will soon be fully open to traffic, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau found that the original passenger cars would be insufficient. It was approved by the Ministry of Railways to use British Boxer Indemnity funds to purchase 21 passenger car chassis. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board approved the purchase, and a contract was signed in the name of the Ministry of Railways, countersigned by the Bureau, with the British Boxer Indemnity Association. After repeated consultations on the construction drawings of the passenger cars, the Ministry of Railways issued a purchase order in June of the 24th year and sent it to the London Purchasing Committee of the British Boxer Indemnity Association for ordering from the British Duzeng Vehicle Manufacturing Company. The order included 18 third-class cars, 15 first and second-class cars, and a complete set of equipment, with a total cost of approximately 510,000 yuan in national currency. All the goods have been shipped in three batches by the end of last year and delivered in Shanghai. The Bureau is currently submitting the vehicle assembly plan to the Ministry of Railways for approval.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Report</h3>
<p>Achievements in the Twenty-Fifth Year; Plans for the Twenty-Sixth Year</p>
<p>During the twenty-fifth year, all the development plans of the China National Aviation Corporation were not only fully realized but also exceeded expectations. The increase in the number of passengers, mail, and packages this year has exceeded that of the twenty-fourth year (the highest record for the company previously). The board of directors' policy of purchasing the latest aircraft has clearly given passengers greater confidence. The passenger mileage for the past year was more than double that of the twenty-fourth year, which is clear proof. In the twenty-first year, the company had only one route, with a distance of only 1,691 kilometers. Since then, it has gradually developed, and by the twenty-fifth year, there were four routes, totaling 5,280 kilometers. Also, in the twenty-first year, the actual flying mileage of the company's aircraft was 694,143 kilometers. In the twenty-fifth year, it increased to 2,466,477 kilometers. In terms of passenger mileage, the twenty-first year was only 1,247,808 passenger kilometers, while the twenty-fifth year was 12,006,944 passenger kilometers. The number of passengers also increased from 3,153 to 18,567 during the same period. If we calculate from the founding of the company in the twentieth year of the Republic of China to the end of the twenty-fifth year, the total number of passengers carried is 46,383, the actual flying mileage is 8,917,950 kilometers, and the total passenger mileage is 25,110,003 passenger kilometers.</p>
<p>Our country's civil aviation is still in its infancy. The China National Aviation Corporation deeply understands its mission and is eager to take the lead. Today, ground transportation is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of general passengers. Therefore, fast and comfortable air transportation is an urgent need. Because our country is vast, this type of transportation is most suitable.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that transportation is most conducive to the progress of our country, and the development of civil aviation cannot be ignored. Therefore, to understand the progress of our country, one can see the general situation by observing the aviation industry. On October 20th of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the China National Aviation Corporation's Los Angeles aircraft carried passengers and mail from Longhua, Shanghai on its maiden voyage to Hankou, covering a distance of 864 kilometers (539 miles) and flying for seven hours. On May 12th of the twenty-fifth year, a Douglas jumbo jet of our company flew 3,901 kilometers (2,423 miles) in one day, stopping nine times, and the flight time was less than thirteen hours. The mileage flown was almost five times that of the maiden voyage seven years ago. This shows the progress of our country's civil aviation during this period. Also, in the twenty-fifth year, the company's passenger mileage increased more than double that of the twenty-fourth year, which is enough to prove that the people of the country are increasingly interested in the aviation industry.</p>
<p>On October 23rd of the twenty-fourth year, our company also launched the Shanghai-Chengdu express flight with Douglas jumbo jets. It takes only three hours to fly from Shanghai to Hankou, and less than seven hours to reach Chengdu, a distance of 1,981 kilometers. Therefore, the convenience of air travel has further attracted the attention of the people of the country. The flight was originally scheduled to operate once a week, but from July 3rd of the twenty-fifth year, it was changed to three times a week.</p>
<p>Last summer, the Douglas jumbo jets on the Shanghai-Beijing line were originally scheduled to operate four times a week, but due to the congestion of passengers, it was changed to a same-day round trip on June 9th. The flight personnel on this route completed a journey of 2,654 kilometers in one day, and their work is also commendable. The Shanghai-Guangzhou line has also been operating three times a week since September 1st of the twenty-fifth year, flying a distance of 1,623 kilometers in less than seven hours. On November 5th of the same year, this line also flew through Hong Kong.</p>
<p>On February 13th of the twenty-fifth year, a joint transportation contract was signed by our company and Air France, operating once a week between Guangzhou and Hanoi. Thus, the direct flight between Europe and Asia and our country's participation in the world aviation network were both realized.</p>
<p>On November 5th of the same year, the Shanghai-Guangzhou line aircraft landed in Hong Kong for the first time. Thus, the China National Aviation Corporation's route can also connect with the British Royal Airways route to reach Europe. The company extends its deepest gratitude to French Minister of Aviation Pierre Cot and British authorities, Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote.</p>
<p>Before February 1st of the twenty-fifth year, the domestic airmail rate system was based on air zones. The rate was 25 cents for every 20 grams per 1,000 kilometers of distance. In other words, each air zone was 25 cents, plus the regular postage of 5 cents, for a total of 30 cents. If it was two air zones, the rate was 55 cents. Three air zones, 80 cents. Four air zones, 1 yuan and 5 cents. With the assistance of the Directorate General of Posts and the approval of the Ministry of Communications, the above-mentioned air zone system was abolished on March 1st of the twenty-fifth year. All domestic airmail is charged 25 cents, plus the regular postage of 5 cents, for a total of 30 cents. Although the company's mail revenue has temporarily decreased after the abolition of this air zone system, the public is very welcome, and it is believed that the number of airmail will increase day by day.</p>
<p>After the Douglas jumbo jets used by our company on various routes, the fares at various locations have gradually decreased, with reduction rates ranging from 10% to 50%. The sharp increase in the number of passengers last year also shows that the China National Aviation Corporation's board of directors' decision to reduce fares was indeed appropriate.</p>
<p>The development plan for the twenty-sixth year is as follows: Before the summer of the twenty-sixth year, three Douglas jumbo jets can be delivered. At that time, the Shanghai-Chengdu express flight will be increased from the current three round trips per week to five round trips per week. The Shanghai-Beijing express flight may also be increased from three round trips per week to five round trips per week.</p>
<p>The Sikorsky seaplane, which has been widely publicized for a long time, is now scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in mid-February of this year. The aircraft can accommodate 18 passengers and 4 pilots, with a normal speed of 270 kilometers per hour. After the Shanghai-Guangzhou line uses this aircraft, the passenger transport situation will definitely improve. The current three round trips per week can be increased to four round trips at that time. After many tests by our company, two direction finders are now installed in the Douglas jumbo jets to maintain the accuracy of the flight. In the future, all jumbo jets of our company will be equipped with this equipment.</p>
<p>In order to achieve perfection in flight technology, our company will also establish fourteen radio beacon stations simultaneously. The locations of the beacon stations are on the Shanghai-Chengdu line and the Chongqing-Guiyang line, for Shanghai, Nanjing, Anqing, Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, Wanxian, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, etc. On the Shanghai-Xiamen line, for Haizhou, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beijing, etc. On the Shanghai-Guangzhou line, for Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, etc. After the beacon stations are established, and each jumbo jet is equipped with a direction finder, our company's night flight equipment can be compared with the most perfect flight equipment in the world, and the flight schedule will be more accurate.</p>
<p>After the jumbo jets arrive in Shanghai this summer, a huge hangar will be built at Longhua Airport to accommodate them. In addition, a passenger lounge will be built for the use of those waiting for the flight. Also, our company will build a huge ramp in the shortest possible time for the new Sikorsky S-43 aircraft. The completion of the above development plan will cost approximately 3 million yuan in national currency.</p>

<h3>British Tram Workers in the Public Concession Strike on the 9th and Return to Work on the 10th</h3>
<p>Workers Submit Ten Demands for Wage Increases, Representatives to Negotiate with the Company on the 15th</p>
<p>Over two thousand workers in the Shanghai Tram Company's car department, including drivers, ticket sellers, conductors, and track switchers, went on strike at 5:30 AM on the 9th due to the company's failure to meet their demands for improved treatment. All tram and trolley bus lines were completely shut down. Upon receiving the report, the Party and government authorities, along with the Municipal General Labor Union, immediately sent representatives to mediate. A four-point agreement was reached at around 8:00 PM that evening, temporarily resolving the issue, and all workers returned to work on the morning of the 10th. The Dagongshe reporter investigated and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Demands Rejected</p>
<p>The British-owned Tram Company's business increased by more than double last year compared to previous years, with considerable profits. All company staff, including coppersmiths, received wage increases, but the more than two thousand drivers, ticket sellers, inspectors, conductors, and track switchers in the car department received nothing. The workers expressed their dissatisfaction and submitted ten demands, sending representatives to demand them from General Manager Eveo, who refused to accept them. They continued to negotiate with Car Department Supervisor Golock, but still to no avail.</p>

<p>Representatives Petition</p>
<p>After all the tram and trolley bus workers went on strike, they selected four representatives to form a petition delegation. At 8:30 AM on the 9th, they went to the Municipal Party Headquarters, Municipal Government, Social Affairs Bureau, General Labor Union, and other organizations to petition. They were received separately by Yu Yaoqiu of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhang (surname) of the Municipal Government, Zhu Guilin of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Gong Yuting of the General Labor Union. After the worker representatives stated their wishes, the Party and government representatives agreed to mediate and advised the representatives to urge all workers to await a resolution quietly.</p>

They then resumed mediation at 6:30 PM, eventually deciding on the following principles: ① The ten demands put forward by the workers will be submitted to the board of directors for discussion. The workers will first send representatives to negotiate directly with the company at 3:00 PM on the 15th of this month. If no resolution is reached, the Party and government agencies will mediate again. ② The company shall not dismiss striking workers under any pretext. ③ Wages for the strike period will be paid at half rate. ④ All workers shall return to work uniformly on the morning of the 10th. Therefore, the case was temporarily concluded.</p>
<p>Resumption of Work on the 10th</p>
<p>The Party and government authorities, in order to prevent the escalation of the situation and to seek a quick resolution at this time of general closing, sent personnel to consult with the company's General Manager Eveo and Car Department Supervisor Golock. It was then decided to resume work first. After the workers' demands were submitted to the board of directors for approval, a direct negotiation between labor and management was scheduled for the 15th of this month. Meanwhile, the Party and government representatives persuaded all workers to accept this plan, which the workers readily agreed to. Therefore, starting on the morning of the 10th, all workers arrived at the factory on time, and the vehicles were driven out to work as usual. The disturbance was brought to a temporary end, and traffic returned to normal. Moreover, as this day was the general closing day, all trams and public buses in the Public Concession, French Concession, and Chinese areas extended their operating hours to facilitate travel. Although it rained that morning, the rain stopped in the afternoon, so passengers going out to shop and taking trams were even more crowded than usual.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Stipulates Registration Method for Long-Distance Calls</h3>
<p>To Avoid Transmission Errors, to Be Implemented on March 1st</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, due to different dialects in various places in China, has found that errors in the transmission of the name and address of the called party often lead to missed calls, or that the name and address are lengthy and the pronunciation is obscure, requiring repeated explanations and wasting time. To reduce such difficulties and improve call efficiency, it has formulated a "Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Called Party Name and Address Registration Method," ordering the telephone bureau to implement it from March 1st. Now, the details of the method are recorded as follows: 1. In order to avoid errors in the name and address of the called party when receiving long-distance calls and to avoid affecting the call, the called party may apply to register their name and address. 2. Applicants should fill out an application form with the local telephone bureau under the Ministry of Communications that handles long-distance telephone services. After the application is approved by the telephone bureau, the telephone bureau will assign a number to replace the name and address of the called party and issue a registration certificate. 3. The address of the called party is limited to within the business area of the telephone bureau, and those without a fixed business area are limited to within three kilometers of the bureau. 4. After the called party obtains the registration certificate, they should immediately notify all relevant callers of the registration number. 5. When the caller transmits a long-distance call, the name and address of the called party may be replaced by the registration number, and the words "registration number" should be prefixed to the number. Example 1: Nanjing - Registration Number 315 - Ordinary Call - 22633 Li Changchun (used by those calling the telephone bureau). Example 2: Ordinary Call - Nanjing - Registration Number 315 - Zhang Sixia, No. 1 Zhongshan Road, Shanghai (filled out by those at retail outlets). 6. The registration is valid from the date of issuance of the registration certificate to the end of the year. Those who wish to continue the registration after the expiration date should apply to the original telephone bureau two weeks before the expiration date. A renewed registration certificate will be issued, and the registration will remain valid for one year. 7. If the called party does not continue to apply within the time limit, the original telephone bureau may cancel their registration number on the expiration date and invalidate the certificate. 8. If the caller still uses the number to transmit a long-distance call after the registration has expired, the called telephone bureau may try to transmit it once and notify the called party to continue the registration. If the called party is unwilling to do so, future calls using the registration number will be stopped and handled as telephone calls where the called party cannot be notified. 9. If the address of the called party changes, the original telephone bureau should be notified in advance for verification. If the called party moves to another location or outside the area stipulated in Article 3, the original telephone bureau should cancel their registration number and invalidate the certificate. 10. The registration number may not be transferred to others. If the name of the called party needs to be changed, the original telephone bureau should be notified to issue a new certificate. 11. The telephone bureau does not charge any fees for handling registration and issuing and renewing certificates. 12. The application of this method is limited to calling and talking. 13. This method will be implemented from March 1, 1937.</p>

<h3>Whereabouts of Bang-Bang Opera Actress Bai Yushuang Unknown</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Perform on New Year's Day, Claimed to Go to the Barber and Never Returned</p>
<p>Bai Yushuang, a Bang-Bang opera actress who enjoyed fame for performing seductive dramas, suddenly went missing on the 6th of this month (the 25th day of the 12th lunar month (Saturday)). Bai's family has posted missing person advertisements, and the most disappointed and directly affected is the Empire Theater in the French Concession. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Original Name Li Guizhen</p>
<p>Bai Yushuang's original name is Li Guizhen. She is from the North and is currently twenty-six years old. Since childhood, she has learned Bang-Bang opera from Zhu Baozia's father, Zhu Liu. It is said that when Bai was sixteen years old, she married a wealthy merchant in Tianjin and had a daughter, Xiao Ziyushuang. However, she soon divorced and returned to her old profession, performing in various ports in Tianjin and Beijing, known for her seductive performances. Among them, "Pan Jinlian," "Shooting the Little Old Woman," and "Widow Ma's Store" are her signature plays.</p>
<p>Forced to Come South</p>
<p>Beijing and Tianjin are the locations of ancient capitals, with pure customs and respect for etiquette and teaching. The plays performed by Bai were deemed by the authorities in Tianjin and Beijing to be a matter of public morals, and she was forced to stop performing. She had no choice but to come south to seek a new path. As soon as she arrived in Shanghai and unpacked her luggage, she was recruited by the Empire Theater in the French Concession. Her first performance was well-received by some people in Shanghai, and her fame soared.</p>
<p>Empire Theater Reform</p>
<p>The owner of the Empire Theater, seeing Bai's potential, transformed the original movie theater into a pure Bang-Bang opera theater. Her play "Pan Jinlian" was performed for several weeks, rivaling the popularity of previous plays such as "The Civet Cat Prince" and "The Investiture of the Gods." Zhao Ruquan, a famous Peking Opera actor, also collaborated with Bai in this play, which shows a glimpse of Bai's artistry.</p>
<p>Signed a Contract and Ran Away</p>
<p>Last summer, Bai led a troupe to perform in Hankou, and returned to Shanghai at the end of autumn, continuing to perform at her favorite place, the Empire Theater. At the end of November, Bai went to Wuxi to perform for two weeks, but at the same time, she continued to sign a contract with the Empire Theater to perform on New Year's Day. After returning to Shanghai from Wuxi, she unexpectedly ran away quietly on the 6th of this month (the 25th day of the 12th lunar month) due to family troubles.</p>
<p>Bai's Foster Mother Advertises</p>
<p>After Bai ran away, Bai's foster mother, Li Bian (from the North, 48 years old), initially hoped that Bai would return in a day or two, so she did not announce it to the outside world. It was not until New Year's Eve was approaching and she was about to perform that Bai's whereabouts remained unknown. At this point, Bai's mother explained the situation to Zhang Weitao, the manager of the Empire Theater, and posted a missing person advertisement (which has been seen in the newspapers). The words were extremely sincere, hoping to urge her to return soon. The Empire Theater was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Why Run Away?</p>
<p>The reasons for Bai's departure are rumored to be different. Some say that Bai recently had a romantic relationship with a Mr. Li, which was broken up by her mother, Li Bian, causing this change. However, according to Li Bian, who currently lives at No. 1 Jian'an Lane, Kaizi'erni Road, a dispute arose over trivial family matters on the evening of the 5th, and Bai went out on the morning of the 6th, claiming to go to the barber, and never returned. However, the reason for Bai's departure is not worth exploring or researching. In short, no matter what, it is nothing more than a love issue.</p>
<h3>County's Re-Investigation of Opium Addiction Completed</h3>
<p>After the expiration of the Shanghai County's re-investigation of opium addiction at the end of last month, it was ordered to extend for another ten days. Therefore, the county government continued to supervise the investigation and crackdown. As a result, many suspects of private addiction and relapse were found and sent to the county hospital for verification. Now, the county government, in addition to ordering the anti-opium bureau to interrogate and dispose of the opium addicts arrested during the re-investigation period separately, will also report the handling situation to the provincial office for inspection.</p>
<h3>Maidservant Unwilling to Return Home, Willing to Go to the Jiliang Institute</h3>
<p>Maid Claims Repeated Abuse by Mistress, Male and Female Abductors Sent Back for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Yao Jinfeng, a fourteen-year-old maidservant in the home of Jiang Wu (surname), a woman from Nanjing, at No. 15, Lane 548, Bazhi Road, suddenly disappeared at around 6:00 PM on the 28th of last month. The Hongkou Police Station was notified and sent Chinese detective Wang Runhe to investigate. It was discovered that Yu Cailang, a Changshu native who runs a job agency at No. 148, North Zhejiang Road, was involved. He was arrested and interrogated. It was learned that his mistress, Mao Qiaoian, Wuxi native, was formerly employed by Jiang Wu (surname) and resigned due to certain reasons. She held a grudge and took advantage of a gap to entice Yao (surname)</p>
<p>The woman out</p>
<p>They went together to the home of a relative with the surname Shi in Xinzhen, Chongming Second District, and hid, attempting to sell her for profit. The next morning, the suspect Yu was sent to the First Special District Court. It was ordered that he be returned to custody and the date be changed. Wang (surname) took an official letter from the court to Chongming and located the address where Mao (surname) was subsequently arrested. However, Yao (surname) had been sent to Shanghai by someone due to the emergency. First she was at the China Hotel at No. 655 Zhejiang Road. On the 5th of this month, she was told to return to the home of Jiang Wu. However, she got lost while walking through the boundary road</p>
<p>Crying in confusion</p>
<p>She was taken to the Sima Police Station by the Chinese police on duty. Because the woman refused to explain that she had been abducted, she was sent to the Jiliang Institute for temporary stay. Mao (surname) was brought to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the police, together with Yao (surname), sent Yu Cailang and Mao Qiaoian to the Criminal Third Tribunal. Labor Bureau lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the facts of the case and said that according to Mao (surname)'s confession at the police station, Yao (surname)'s departure was indeed instigated by Yu Cailang. On that day, she had a scarf left in the house of Jiang Wu and took the opportunity to take it when Yao (surname) was beaten by her for a trivial matter. She lured her out and first went to Yu (surname)'s job agency</p>
<p>Stayed for a night</p>
<p>They continued to stay at the China Hotel on Zhejiang Road for two days and discussed with Mao (surname) to take the woman to Chongming for profit. Now, the woman's employer Jiang Wu (surname) and her father Yao Beijin have all come to court, but the woman is unwilling to return to Jiang Wu (surname) or Yao Beijin. According to the woman Jinfeng, "I have been a maid in Jiang's family for about two years. At first, my mistress treated me well, but recently, if I did something wrong, I would be beaten. When I went to Jiang's family, my father went with me. The price was 60 yuan and it was stated that I would go with Mao (surname)</p>
<p>The course of the escape</p>
<p>I now wish to study at the Jiliang Institute," etc. According to Jiang Wu (surname), "Jinfeng is not a maid. At that time, her father made the decision for her to work in my house. The 60 yuan was a loan her father took out because of poverty." According to Yao Beijin, "Jinfeng is my biological daughter." The two defendants blamed each other and evaded responsibility. Judge Xiao Bianfen ordered a postponement and ordered the Jiliang Institute to submit its charter for review. Yu Cailang and Mao Qiaoian were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>The Case of Gong Chunpu's Involvement in the Assassination Attempt on Mr. Soong has Resulted in Arrest</h3>
<p>The Court Approves Detention for One Week; Bail Request Denied</p>
<p>Wang Yaqiao, the Anhui native and leader of an assassination ring, had followers throughout the country. Their daily work consisted of assassinating central political figures and important government officials. Recently, news spread that Wang was murdered in Guilin, Guangxi. During the Republic of China Year 21, the Shanghai Municipal Council police arrested twenty-one of Wang's followers, including Long Lin, Tang Ming, Zhang Chunting, and Wei Jiayun. They were found to have a significant connection to the assassination attempt on Soong Tzu-wen and other important cases. They were handed over to the First Special District Court, which ruled on November 9 of the same year to transfer them to inland authorities for interrogation. During the trial, the suspects confessed that Gong Chunpu, also known as Duanfu (42 years old this year), from Xiangyin, Hunan, was also a key figure, equivalent in rank to Wang Yaqiao. Therefore, the police have been paying attention to the investigation, but for several years, Gong's whereabouts have remained unknown, making it impossible to bring him to justice. On February 8 this year, You A’gen, the chief Chinese detective of the Old Zha Police Station, along with detectives Pang Ruiqing and Li Shugui, learned that Gong had arrived in Shanghai and was living at 578 Baker Road. They collaborated with Western detective Mike Mau and went to the address, where they successfully arrested Gong and brought him back to the police station. On the morning of the 9th, he was escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division 1. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the defendant, Gong Chunpu, had already written a detailed confession at the police station. Copies of the confessions previously made by Long Lin and others were also brought to the court by the police. However, there was still various evidence in the case that could not be verified due to time constraints. Therefore, the prosecution was temporarily suspended, and a request was made for his detention. When questioned, Gong confessed that he knew a few of Long Lin and others, and that they were Wang Yaqiao's followers. He claimed that he had just arrived in Shanghai from Peiping and was immediately arrested. He had no time to gather any evidence and requested that he be granted bail. After reviewing the confession, Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, ruled that Gong Chunpu be detained for one week for further questioning, and that the request for bail was denied.</p>
<h3>Sudden High Tide in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Unabated for Three Consecutive Days</p>
<p>Since the morning of the Lunar New Year's Eve, there was torrential rain in Shanghai until 12:30 pm. In the afternoon, there was drizzle that stopped and started intermittently, and yesterday the weather finally cleared up. However, the weather felt even colder. Since the Lunar New Year's Day, the northeast wind has been strong, and the tide has suddenly risen. For the past two days, the tide has risen to more than 39 feet on the Customs House water gauge. The tide in Wusong Yunzaobang has reached the same level as the road. The south bank is slightly lower, and the tide has already reached the shore, turning the fields into a swamp. Sanjiashuikou is a vast expanse of water with raging waves crashing into the sky. Sailing boats have stopped operating, and the water is muddy and quite salty. Because it is the beginning of the year, people call it the "New Year's Tide." But in reality, it is because the wind is so strong that the sea tide is blowing into the river mouth, turning the freshwater salty, making it undrinkable. As a result, the price of freshwater has risen sharply, which is a great opportunity for water carriers.</p>
<h3>Spring Snowfall the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the Spring Festival, the weather in this city has suddenly turned cold. At around 3:30 pm the day before yesterday, it suddenly snowed, followed by light rain, which stopped in the evening. The wind was very strong, and until yesterday evening, the northwest wind continued to howl, making the cold even more severe. Pedestrians on the road were all shivering.</p>
<h3>Twelve Stab Wounds for One Dime</h3>
<p>Wu Aru, a Yancheng native who runs a fruit stall, was owed one dime by Sun Baoshou, a Rugao native, for a long time. So, on the Lunar New Year's Eve, he went to Sun's house at No. 12, Nan'gao Lane, Dapu Bridge Road, to ask for the debt. When he couldn't get the money, a conflict broke out at the entrance of the alley. Wu pulled out a sharp knife and stabbed Sun in the head more than a dozen times. Sun was bleeding profusely from his wounds and fell to the ground in extreme pain. Seeing that he had caused trouble, Wu ran away. The nearby police heard the commotion and arrived to intercept the suspect and recover the murder weapon. He was taken to the Ximen Branch for questioning, and the injured person was sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>The Xinwei Relief Association Sends Refugees Back to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>The National Relief Commission Appropriates Funds to Aid Refugees in Shanghai</p>
<p>Xin Xin She reports that the Xinwei Relief Association in this city found that many refugees from various places were stranded in Shanghai, most of them suffering from hunger and cold and in urgent need of relief. In addition to sending a telegram to the National Relief Commission to request an appropriation of 500 yuan for refugee relief in Shanghai to purchase and distribute goods, they also distributed 600 cotton coats, 500 cotton pants, and more than 120 cotton quilts. At the same time, more than 400 refugees from the valley were sent back to their hometowns in succession.</p>
<h3>All Three Defendants in the Headless Trunk Murder Case are Released</h3>
<p>After Detailed Investigation, the Police Believe There is No Need for a Third Trial Appeal</p>
<p>On the evening of August 11th of this year, patrol officers of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police found a rattan box on Suzhou Road near the Bund, containing the headless body of a woman. Later, Lin Gendi, who worked as a hostess at the Sincere Amusement Park, was overheard by people on Carter Road making frightening statements about murder, which caught the attention of the police. Huang Fusen, a detective from the Hongkou Police Station,</p>
<p>arrested her.</p>
<p>Under questioning, Lin confessed that the headless body in the trunk was killed on August 8th in the pavilion room at No. 3 Cunfu Lane, White Paul Road, together with fireman Mao A'gen and Jiang Yuan'tan. The deceased was named Caiying, a hostess at the Great World Company. The detectives then arrested Mao and Jiang and sent them to the First Special District Court. Jiang once confessed, but then retracted his confession, claiming that he had been tortured. Mao, on the other hand,</p>
<p>denied it from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The trial judge, Zhong Qing, and the defendant's lawyer, Fan Gang, were tireless in their pursuit of the truth (repeatedly investigating in detail), and finally discovered many doubts that did not match the facts. Therefore, Judge Zhong announced that Lin and the other two were not guilty. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Second High Court. After two trials, the High Court rejected the appeal. At that time, the police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, requested that Lin and others be temporarily detained during the third trial appeal period.</p>
<p>for consideration</p>
<p>as to whether a third appeal should be filed. The judge approved it. After carefully studying the judgments of the first and second trials, Mr. Gan determined that there was no need to file a third appeal. He then declared to the Second High Court that he was abandoning the appeal and requested that Lin and others be released. The High Court immediately issued a release order and sent it to the prison. On the morning of Lunar New Year's Eve, Lin, Mao, and Jiang were finally freed, but they had already endured more than three months in prison.</p>
<h3>Seven or Eight Thatched Huts Destroyed by Fire on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei</h3>
<p>Zhang Qingniang Suffers Burns</p>
<p>At around 11:30 pm last night, a fire broke out in a thatched hut without a signboard on the west end of the Third Civilian Village on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, immediately breaking through the roof and spreading to neighboring houses. The Zhabei Fire Brigade rushed to the scene with belt-driven fire engines and extinguished the fire after an hour. As a result, seven or eight thatched huts were burned down. It is reported that Zhang Qingniang, an old woman from Jiangbei who started the fire, was burned and taken to the hospital by ambulance for treatment.</p>
<h3>Four Robbers Rob Gong's Home, Stabbing with Knives and Firing Guns</h3>
<p>Gong Shun'song's Home in Tanziwan Robbed; Lin Sheng and His Brother Injured While Wrestling with the Robbers</p>
<p>Gong Shun'song, a local resident, lives in a bungalow in Gongjiazhai, Tanziwan, Zhabei. He makes a living by renting out vehicles and has a small amount of savings. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon at around 7:00 pm, he was targeted by robbers. At that time, one of the four robbers carried a gun, and the other three carried sharp knives. After entering the house, they threatened the men and women inside, forbidding them to move, and demanded silver and cash. However, there was no large amount of savings in the house, and they only got about thirty yuan. The robbers were still not satisfied, so they opened the wardrobe and saw two fur coats inside, which they grabbed and fled with. At this time, Gong's two sons, Lin Sheng, 35, and Changgen, 17, saw the robbers leaving the house and chased them out. Taking advantage of the robbers' unpreparedness, they rushed forward and wrestled two of the robbers, shouting, "Catch the robbers!" In desperation, the two robbers stabbed the brothers' hands, legs, and feet with their sharp knives. However, Lin Sheng and others still held on firmly. Then the robbers fired two shots at Lin Sheng and Changgen, hitting their right thigh, causing them to fall to the ground in pain. Only then did the robbers break free. Fortunately, the police station in charge had received a report and dispatched police to the scene. They captured one of the robbers carrying a knife and immediately took him to the police station. After questioning, he confessed the whereabouts of his accomplices. The police station then dispatched detectives to pursue the remaining robbers and have arrested them. They are being detained temporarily, pending a written report to the General Bureau for investigation. The injured Gong brothers were also sent to Renji Hospital by the police station for treatment. Fortunately, the knife and gunshot wounds they sustained were not serious and should not cause any major problems.</p>

<h3>The Reason for the True Perpetrator of the Xue Mairuo Robbery Case Surrendering Himself</h3>
<p>Huang Xixiang and Others Decide to Surrender; Prison Warden Notifies the Shanghai Municipal Council Police</p>
<p>Zhou Jinggeng, the comprador of the Xue Mairuo Accounting Firm at No. 9 Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, sent someone to the China Industrial Bank on the afternoon of June 9, 1934, to withdraw 18,000 yuan in new banknotes, to be used for the dog racing at the Yiyuan racecourse in the evening. At around 4:00 pm, the person who withdrew the money returned to the firm. A few minutes later, four robbers armed with weapons broke in and stole 12,000 yuan. After the victim reported to the French police, it involved Zhang Zuming (shareholder of the Rui Yu Shun Hardware Store on Broadway Road), Zhuang Jimeng (owner of Zhuang Yuan Hardware Store in Hongkou), Wang Lianyou (hardware store street vendor), and Tang Qingyue (dean of Dade Hospital on Gordon Road), all four being Ningbo natives, and a Taicang native. Gao Yushu, the victim's servant, and others identified them as the robbers. The French Concession Police Department filed a public prosecution with the Special Court on charges of robbery. The trial resulted in the acquittal of the four defendants due to lack of evidence of guilt. The Police Department disagreed and repeatedly appealed to the Third High Court and the Supreme Court, which, after three trials, upheld the original judgment. Lawyer Yan Luqing was also implicated for extorting money from the families of Zhang, Zhuang, and Tang, which led to a defendant reporting him. He was sentenced to two and a half years in prison and fined 800 yuan, which he is currently serving. Later, Zhuang Jimeng sued Zhang Zuming for perjury and false accusation, and Zhang Zuming sued Zhou Jinggeng, Gao Yushu, Feng Ti'e, Wan Guiying, Qian Guihua, Wang Agui, and others for perjury and false accusation. The Second Special Court ruled that all were not guilty. The case caused a sensation at the time. Various circumstances were repeatedly reported in previous newspapers. Now, the real robbers in the case have been arrested, and the details are as follows: This case was actually committed by Shen Fugui (from Taizhou), who was at large, in collusion with Huang Aying, Huang Xixiang, Wang Zhengji, and Fang Jingui, all natives of Ningbo, and five people from Hangzhou. They split the loot. Shen used 6,000 yuan, Huang Aying got 1,500 yuan, and the others got 1,000 yuan each. They also distributed money to their followers and fled in different directions. In September of last year, Huang, Huang, Wang, and Fang also robbed three shops, including the Shaanxi Bank at No. 49 Huangpu Bund, French Concession. After spending all the money, the four, in collusion with Pan Weisheng and five others, robbed three Qian Zhuang shops, Yuanheng, Shikang, and Baoshen, in the Public Concession. Pan opened fire and killed the victim's servant. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police arrested them all and sent them to the First Special District Court for prosecution. Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Division tried the case and sentenced Pan Weisheng to death on November 30, Huang Aying to 18 years in prison, Huang Xixiang to 14 years in prison, Wang Zhengji to 12 years in prison, and Fang Jingui to 10 years in prison. The judgments were final, and they were sent to prison to serve their sentences. Huang Aying learned in prison that Shen Fugui, the leader in the Xue Mairuo case, had returned to Shanghai and was living in the Xinling Village on Caishi Road, French Concession. Fearing that Shen Fugui would be arrested and confess to their involvement, which would increase their sentences and leave them with no chance of being released from prison, he confessed with his accomplices Huang Xixiang, Wang Zhengji, and Fang Jingui, hoping for a reduced sentence. They decided to confess to the warden of the Tilanqiao Prison that they had committed robberies in the French Concession, including the Xue Mairuo case and the Shaanxi Bank case, and asked for verification. The warden informed the Shanghai Municipal Council Police, who informed the French Concession Police and requested the Second Special Court to dispatch inspectors Jiang Futian and Li Xianyang, and detective Zhou Ruzhang, on the 8th of this month to the First Special Court to transfer the four robbers, Huang Aying, Huang Xixiang, Wang Zhengji, and Fang Jingui, back to the case. The next day, they were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Gu Shouxi, the lawyer for the Shanghai Municipal Council Police, stated the facts of the case and requested a postponement of two weeks for investigation before filing charges. When questioned, the four defendants confessed to committing two robbery cases. Wang and Fang did not go to the Shaanxi Bank case and only each received 50 yuan. The court verified the confessions and decided to postpone the interrogation to the 26th. The defendants were returned to custody. Huang Aying's appearance closely resembled Zhang Zuming, who was identified by the victim's partner, Gao Yushu. Huang Aying was passing by his friend's car shop on Guangxi Road when Gao Yushu saw him. Zhang Zuming happened to be going to the car shop to hire a car at that time. Huang Aying noticed that Gao Yushu was following him and fled into the crowd, causing Gao to mistake Zhang Zuming for the robber and report him to the police for arrest, resulting in a sensational miscarriage of justice. The injustice suffered by Zhang and others has now been cleared, but it has caused hardship for the victim, Zhou Jinggeng, and the lawyer, Yan Luqing. Zhang Zuming's lawsuit against Zhou and others for perjury and false accusation is still under appeal, and it is unknown when this lawsuit will end.</p>
<h3>Three News Agencies Host a Banquet for Dong Xian'guang and Others</h3>
<p>Since Dong Xian'guang, the general manager of the Shanghai Times News, Da Wan Bao, and Shenshi Telegraphic News Agency, resigned due to his inability to manage all three companies and was replaced by Cui Weiwu, the three companies held a grand celebration at the Datong Restaurant the night before last to welcome and send off the two general managers. More than two hundred people from the three companies attended, making for a lively scene. First, Shen Gongbi, the chief writer of the Shanghai Times News, reported on the service spirit of the new and old general managers and, on behalf of the colleagues, presented each of them with a commemorative silver shield. Then, Dong Xian'guang and Cui Weiwu gave thank-you speeches, offering much encouragement. Finally, Zeng Chubaishi, the chief writer of the Da Wan Bao, described his thoughts and hopes on the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Da Wan Bao. After the speech, they gathered for a meal, raising their glasses and exchanging toasts. During the meal, they invited the comedian Liu Chunyou and the Pingju opera stars Zhu Binxia and her sister to sing songs, as well as Xiao Yanqin and others to perform drum accompaniment. The performers were very energetic, and the whole place was filled with joy. The party ended at around 11:00 pm.</p>

This month's lottery drawing is scheduled to be held publicly at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 pm. In order to facilitate savings account holders joining the association and making payments, the association will be open as usual today. Because it is the Lunar New Year, savers wish to try their luck in the New Year, so the number of people joining the association in the last day or two has been exceptionally high.</p>

In view of this, this bookstore published "Current Situation of China's Economy" two years ago, and specially invited several economic experts to write it. The entire book adopts a lecture format, divided into eight lectures, with substantial materials and simple language. The authors of each lecture had careful plans in advance, so there is no duplication of content in the lectures, which is a major advantage of this book. Since the book was published, it has sold out in three editions in just two years, which shows the popularity of the book in all circles. Recently, readers have often written letters, either requesting a reprint or requesting that the book be revised and supplemented. Now, in order to thank readers for their kindness, this bookstore has invited the original authors to supplement the new materials of the past two years, increasing the original length by about two-thirds. At the end of the book, the two articles "Where is the Road to China's Economic Construction?" and "The Past, Present, and Future of China's Steel Industry," which were recently published in the Shanghai Shenbao Weekly, have been included as appendices for readers' reference.

<h3>Male Corpse Found Murdered on Bansongyuan Road</h3>
<p>Chu Heshang, who lives in Deren Chongguan Lane on Bansongyuan Road in the Nanshi area, suddenly discovered an unknown male corpse on the pedestrian path at the entrance of the lane at around 6:00 am yesterday morning. The deceased was about 30 years old, bald, barefoot, without clothing on his upper body, and wearing black cloth pants on his lower body. Upon closer inspection, there were rope marks on his neck, indicating that he had been strangled to death and abandoned. He immediately reported to the police on duty. The police station reported to the Xidou Branch, which dispatched police to investigate. At around 7:00 am, Zhang Gengsheng, a native of Nantong, reported to the police station that he was 38 years old and lived at No. 33, Lane 283, Bansongyuan Road. He worked as a rickshaw puller. The deceased was Zhang Maotao, 34 years old, his cousin. He had left alone at around 10:00 am on the Lunar New Year's Day and had not been seen since. Because he usually liked to gamble, he had now died violently, which he identified as correct, and requested a report. The bureau ordered the local bailiff to report to the court for a coroner's examination and verification.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pulling Conflicts Incite Workers' Brawl</h3>
<p>Dai Xuehong, the police chief of the Huining Road Police Station in Nanshi, received a report at around 7:00 pm on the 8th that Zhang Yusheng, a Hubei native in the Quzhenren Road area, had been involved in a conflict with a pedestrian due to careless rickshaw pulling, which led to more than one hundred workers from the pig bristle factory and weaving factory gathering, each carrying iron rods and other weapons, and fighting on the street. He immediately led several police officers to suppress the brawl. However, the workers had already fled. Only Huang Xuefa, Huang Yezhong, Liang Jiayin, Wang Fuchang, Sun Shaoqing, Li Mulin, Li Xinggui, Zhang Dequan, Wang Fuyin, Liang Zeshun, Liang Zehong, the woman Huang Zhoushi, the woman Wang Zhangshi, and the troublemaker Zhang Yusheng were arrested on the spot, along with more than twenty iron rods and wooden sticks, and taken to the police station for questioning.

<h3>Public Telephone Stolen</h3>

<h3>Sheng Sheng Hospital Solves the Difficulty of Childbirth</h3>
<p>Qu Shaoheng's Compassionate Heart - Worthy of Attention by Common People</p>
<p>Childbirth is a dangerous matter for women, yet many are mistaken about the timing. Otherwise, with proper obstetrical assistance, there should be no risk to life. Dr. Qu Shaoheng, the superintendent of Sheng Sheng Hospital on Route Sapoise in the French Concession, has devoted himself to the study of obstetrics and gynecology, and does not hesitate to travel to the countryside. On the 3rd of this month, at 1:00 PM, Mrs. Chen Shi of Chen Family Alley, east end of Yangjia Town, Pudong, had a difficult childbirth. Due to postpartum complications, she was invited to the hospital at 1:40 PM, but the parturient was beyond saving. It turned out that she had felt labor pains at 11:30 PM on the previous night and hired a midwife. At 9:30 AM, she delivered a healthy boy, and the whole family rejoiced. Initially, the parturient was quite pleased with herself, but due to improper postpartum care, she became dizzy and lost consciousness, eventually losing her life. This was purely due to not seeking treatment early enough. On the 9th of the same month, at 11:50 AM, a woman from the Xu family residence in Lu Family Alley, southeast of the Old City God Temple in Pudong, was having a twin breech birth. The midwife managed to deliver one child, but it was stillborn. Soon after, another child's hand was seen, causing great alarm. Midwife Qu Duizhen was invited to examine her and said it was a transverse presentation and had been too long. The child was already dead, and only an expert physician could save the mother's life. The Xu family then entrusted the upper-level company to telegraph Dr. Qu to come. He removed the child and saved the mother. According to him, this kind of breech presentation would not have been a problem if handled earlier. The 11th was the Lunar New Year's Day. A woman surnamed Gu was in labor and invited Dr. Qu's wife, Yao Ying, a female doctor, to come. The child had already fallen into the toilet, and the parturient was bleeding and dizzy. Yao, rich in experience, held the parturient with one hand and lifted the baby from the toilet with the other. Then, with the help of family members, she carefully moved her to the bed, slowly removed the afterbirth, and promptly injected the parturient with a hemostatic injection. Subsequently, the assistant held the baby and further removed the fecal water and blood from the trachea. As a result, both lives were saved. It is said that in childbirth, as long as preparations are made early and the timing is not missed, it can be said there is no danger. Dr. Qu especially hopes that the poor can stay in the hospital and receive civilian treatment, because poor families often face inconvenience in a hurry, but once admitted to the hospital, everything is convenient, and the daily fee is only thirty cents.</p>
<h3>The Datong Hospital Abortion Case is Postponed</h3>
<p>Li Wengui, a native of Shaoxing, is forty-six years old this year. He married Li Jingzhen (25 years old), a woman from Shanghai, as his second wife in Shanghai, living at No. 97, Yongyu Lane, Route Belles in the French Concession. Wengui has been engaged in business in Tianjin and spends most of his time there. Jingzhen, living in Shanghai, could not bear to sleep alone and had an affair with Shen Fusheng, renting another small house at No. 673, Route Belles. Recently, Jingzhen became pregnant, already four months along. Fearing that she would be ashamed in front of her husband when she gave birth, she had the idea of having an abortion. On the 4th of this month, at 4:00 PM, Jingzhen told her maid, Chu Zhangshi (49 years old, a native of Nanxun), that she had business to attend to in Suzhou and would return in a week, instructing her to take care of the housework and the children. She then went to the small house with her girlfriend, Xue Kebin (21 years old, a native of Shanghai, residing at No. 1, Tengfeng Lane, Baiyi Street, inside the Old North Gate). They invited the landlord, Mrs. Hu Chen, and the maternal uncle of her lover, Shen Fusheng (name unknown), to accompany her to Datong Gynecology Hospital for an abortion. By 8:30 AM on the 5th, she had died. The hospital notified the deceased's family. The maid, Chu Zhangshi, reported to the French Concession police on the afternoon of the 6th that the hospital had performed an abortion without reporting to the police beforehand or afterward, which violated regulations and was inhumane. The police arrested the doctor, Gu Shaocen, Xue Kebin, and others and sent the corpse to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for an autopsy. On the 8th, they reported to the chief prosecutor of the Second Special Court, Jiang Zhuan, and the forensic officer, who dissected the lower part of the deceased and verified that the deceased had indeed died from an abortion. After interrogating the defendants and witnesses Chu Zhangshi, Hu Chenmin, Xia Chenshi, etc., they ordered the corpse to be claimed by the deceased's brother, Li Wende, for burial. The defendants were handed over by the police department. After the autopsy, the police sent the defendants to the Second Special Court, where Judge Chen Shuoying presided over the First Criminal Court. The police department's lawyer was questioned and requested a postponement of the investigation before prosecuting. The interrogation was strict. The doctor claimed that the deceased had had an abortion elsewhere and came to his clinic for treatment because the placenta had not been expelled and that he had not performed the abortion. Dr. Gu denied helping with the abortion, and Xue also denied introducing the hospital, only admitting to accompanying her, etc. The court ordered a postponement until the morning of the 15th (tomorrow) for another hearing.

<h3>First Shanghai-Hong Kong Chinese Intercity Football Match Today</h3>
<p>Shanghai Team Went to Hong Kong on the 9th for Three Matches</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 13th - After the East China football team arrived in Hong Kong on the 11th, they watched the Shanghai-Hong Kong match on the 13th and attended the regional match on the 14th. The Physical Education Association hosted a banquet at 7:00 PM. On the 15th, they watched the Shanghai vs. Military Alliance match and attended a dinner hosted by the Chinese Swimming Association. On the 16th, they took a bus tour around the New Territories. On the 17th, they played against the Hong Kong United team and attended a dinner hosted by the South China Athletic Association. The first Shanghai-Hong Kong Chinese intercity football match is scheduled to take place in Hong Kong today. The Shanghai team traveled south on the 9th, led by Jiang Xiangqing, the representative of the National Sports Association, coach Rong Qizhao, and manager Yu Hengzhi. According to Mr. Jiang, this competition is not a resumption of the previous regional competitions. Some years ago, there were so-called Li Xishen Cup regional football competitions, but because the National Games also included a football championship, the regional competitions were no longer necessary and were discontinued midway. This time, the Hong Kong Chinese Amateur Sports Federation initiated the Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese football match, which was approved by the National Sports Promotion Association. Therefore, this competition in Hong Kong should be called the first Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese intercity football match. It is understood that the Shanghai team will play a total of three games in Hong Kong. Today is the official match. On the 17th, they will play against the Hong Kong Military Alliance, and on the 21st, they will play against the Guangdong-Hong Kong United team, both of which are friendly matches. After the matches, they will take the Asia Queen liner back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Overturning All Predictions, Shanghai Intercity Team Defeats Hong Kong Team</h3>
<p>Shanghai Team's Offense is Extremely Strong, Winning Three Goals in the First Half - The Overall Result is Four to Three. Hong Kong Team's Performance is Abnormal. The Shanghai Team Also Defeats the China United Team Yesterday</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 13th (Special Dispatch) - The Shanghai football team played against the Hong Kong Chinese United team at Caroline Hill on the afternoon of the 13th. China United reserved its strength in preparation for the regional football match on the 14th, so it only sent young and strong players to play. The crowd watching was no smaller than on the day of the intercity match. The Shanghai team won 4-1. The team is scheduled to watch the East China-South China regional match on the 14th, play against the Hong Kong Military Alliance on the 15th, and have a banquet at the Hong Kong Hotel. They will rest on the 16th, take a car tour around Hong Kong Island on the 17th, and take the Iron Company's Narudana liner back to Shanghai on the 18th.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 11th (Reuters) - The annual Shanghai-Hong Kong intercity football match was held here today. The Shanghai team overturned all predictions, played with all their strength, and defeated the Hong Kong team. The result was four to three.</p>
<p>Before the match, the Shanghai team thought they had little chance of winning against the strong Hong Kong team. However, the Shanghai team's performance was exceptionally good, making the most of all available opportunities. Their victory was the result it should have been.</p>
<p>Foon, the right wing of the Shanghai team, scored two of the four goals. Jem Watts and Laubasstoff each scored one.</p>
<p>On the Hong Kong side, star player Li Huitang scored once, once with a penalty kick, and Wilson scored the other goal.</p>
<p>The last few minutes of the match were full of thrills. The Hong Kong team did its best to counterattack fiercely, hoping to tie the game. The Shanghai team's victory today also won back the lost Telegraph Cup. The lineups of both sides were as follows.</p>
<p>Winning the First Goal - The Hong Kong team kicked off first, but failed to take advantage. Shanghai advanced aggressively, its momentum formidable. The Hong Kong side counterattacked, approaching the goal. Ma Shanger kicked the ball out. The ball circled around, and Laubasstoff finally got a chance to send the ball into the net, opening the scoring.</p>
<p>Winning the Second Goal - The Shanghai team was greatly excited and continued to attack the Hong Kong goal. Jem Watts received a brilliant pass from his brother Jack and shot the ball against the crossbar, bouncing down and in. Shanghai led 2-0.</p>
<p>Winning the Third Goal - The Hong Kong team showed some vitality after this setback, but because they were eager to win, they repeatedly missed opportunities. Before the end of the first half, Foon charged into the net with the ball, and Bao Jiaping was unable to save it.</p>
<p>Losing Two Goals - The Hong Kong team was greatly stimulated by this heavy blow and became lively. In the second minute of the second half, Li Huitang shot in a fast, low ball. After this goal, Wilson followed up with another shot. The ball was shot fiercely by Yang Shuiyi, and the ball rebounded off the foot of a Shanghai defender. Wilson got it and scored.</p>
<p>Winning the Fourth Goal - The Shanghai team regained momentum. Foon received a pass from Bao Xiutuo and sent the ball in, expanding the Shanghai team's score to 4-2.</p>
<p>Losing the Third Goal - The Hong Kong side counterattacked desperately, circling in the Shanghai half for a long time, but ultimately failed to score. Unexpectedly, at the Shanghai goal, Boringai collided with Li Huitang, and Li Huitang was awarded a penalty kick.</p>
<p>Maintaining the Lead - In the last few minutes, the Shanghai team did its best to maintain this one-goal lead. Li Huitang had an excellent opportunity a few yards from the goal, but he shot a wild ball, which was a great pity.</p>
<h3>Beijing Amateur Basketball Team Wins One and Loses Two in Shanghai</h3>
<p>First Wins Against the Xin Team, Then Loses to Xintong - Tang Liu's Skills are Far Not as Good as Before</p>
<p>The Beijing Amateur Basketball Team, formerly known as the Tianjin Lianghua Basketball Team, came to Shanghai at the end of the Lunar Year. Starting on New Year's Day, they played three consecutive games in Shanghai. On the 11th, they defeated the Xin team 60-30 in the first game. The night before, in the second game against Xintong, they lost by four points, 40-44. Last night, they played Xintong again and were defeated 28-48. The details of the three games are summarized as follows. The team will return to Beijing today.</p>
<p>First Game - The amateur team is not as elite as it was in the Lianghua era. They prioritize defense over offense. The two guards, Zhang and Yin, are as solid as gold. Among the forwards, Li Zhenzhong is naturally a pillar. Tang and Liu are not as good as before and lack the sharpness of the Lianghua era. The reserves are also far inferior. But they are more than capable of dealing with the Xin team. In this game, the Xin team took the lead in the first ten minutes. Lu Zhangan committed his third foul, which put a major constraint on the Xin team. The amateur team took the opportunity to launch a major offensive. At 22-16, Lu committed his fourth foul and was sent off. The Xin team's situation deteriorated. The amateur team led 31-19 in the first half. At the start of the second half, the amateur team's momentum was even greater. However, both sides committed more fouls. At 33-23, Zhou Dayun was also sent off. At 40-26, Tang Shikun was injured in the leg and left the game. In the last minute, Li Zhenzhong also committed his fourth foul and was sent off. In an instant, the game ended, and the amateur team won 60-30.</p>
<p>Second Game - In the second game on the evening of the 12th, against Xintong, the amateur team overcame many difficulties and surpassed Xintong three times in the second half. Unfortunately, they still lost 40-44. Xintong led 19-16 in the first half. Xintong's strength is very strong. In addition to the original players, they also added Mai Lingzhi, Locke, and the guard Phihes of the American All-Star Basketball Team. Therefore, it was not easy for the amateur team to achieve this result. In the first fifteen minutes of this game, Xintong was invincible and led 12-3. At this point, the amateur team gradually improved and worked hard to catch up, narrowing the gap to 16-18. The first half ended 16-19. In the second half, the situation was unpredictable. Tang, Liu, and Li's swish shots scored repeatedly, and the amateur team surpassed Xintong for the first time at 26-25. Although Zhang Jingshi committed his fourth foul and was sent off, the amateur team led 30-28 for the second time. Unexpectedly, at 34-29, Xintong scored nine consecutive points, and Xintong took the lead again. However, after the guard Phihes committed his fourth foul and was sent off, the amateur team, with the efforts of Liu and Sun, led Xintong for the third time at 39-38. Unfortunately, in the last three minutes, Locke scored repeatedly, and the amateur team lost 40-44.</p>
<p>Third Game - Last night, the amateur team played Xintong again at Shenyuan and suffered a major defeat of 28-48. They trailed 15-17 in the first half by two points. After two nights of consecutive battles, the amateur team showed signs of exhaustion in the second half last night and could not resist Xintong's new forces, finally becoming unable to recover. In the first half, the amateur team played extremely well and seemed likely to take revenge. They led 13-6, but Locke and Lein gradually caught up and tied the game, with Xintong leading by two points at 15-17. In the second half, Wu Bixian replaced Zhang Jingshi, and Li retreated to the guard position. They lost six consecutive points, and the gap widened. At 22-31, Sun Huipei replaced Li Zhenzhong, and the situation became even worse at 24-39. Zhang Jingshi committed his fourth foul and was sent off, and the outcome was already predetermined. At 44-24, although Lein was also sent off, it could not change the situation. The final score was 28-48. In the second half, Phihes, Carson, and the others from Xintong were courageous and formidable, and they were truly a formidable team. The amateur team was in a bitter battle, and the different physical conditions and rest situations made the defeat not a crime of war.</p>

<h3>Commercial and Industrial Circles Show Signs of Joy, Celebrating the New Year and Wishing Prosperity</h3>
<p>A phenomenon rarely seen in the past five years, but actual development still awaits; The fifth day of the Lunar New Year coincides with “Gold Danger Danger”; to prosper, one must still rely on one’s own efforts</p>
<p>Last year was the first year in nearly five years that various industries in Shanghai saw the most improvement, especially in the second half of the year, which showed signs of prosperity. The improvement in market prices last year started with oil cakes and miscellaneous grains, followed by flour, wheat, yarn, and cotton. In the second half of the year, the sales of cloth were temporarily prosperous, which made the rise in cotton yarn unstoppable, and all cotton textiles also rose in price. In addition, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places almost always purchased Xun rice and other japonica rice throughout the year, and the rice price became more expensive even when new rice came out. Beans, wheat, and sesame were also expensive. It is said that except for a few people in the rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, and oil cake industries who made mistakes in their judgment and occasionally failed, none of them made less than a threefold profit. Just looking at the small section of Bean Market Street, brokers made profits of more than two million yuan. Other grain brokers and rice shops in Zhabei Hexia are not included. From this, we can get a general idea of the rest. As for the banks, bad debts have gradually decreased, and their operations are prudent, so profits can be secured. Even with savings bonus deposits, there are still more than 8% interest. Bank dividends are also mostly paid out before the old accounting period, which shows the abundance of funds. However, since the implementation of legal tender, banks no longer have the ability to give and take as they did in the era of issuing their own banknotes. Therefore, the most abundant profits are naturally those with the power to issue banknotes. The cotton yarn industry has naturally made profits with the step-by-step increase in yarn prices last year. The generous dividends of the yarn and cloth exchange can prove the profitability of the yarn industry. The cotton cloth industry also shouted "overturned" and "earned overturned," making so much money that they could not bear it and overturned, not because of business failure. However, after the price of cloth rose, there was a temporary decline, and the hidden losses were not small. The shipping industry benefited from the continuous transportation of rice, flour, yarn, and cloth in large quantities from the north. After the second half of the year, the Guangdong Bureau was unified, and foreign rice was taxed, so transportation to the south was also strong. Whether it was Taikoo or China Merchants, the profit was millions. Customs brokers who did business in the north also benefited. Even small customs brokers who reported grain made a lot of profit. Since the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the business of the transshipment industry has also expanded considerably. Although the gold and silver industry had fixed gold prices, it was not easy to make profits. However, Shanghai is still a major port, and although gold prices are expensive, buyers continue to buy. Labor costs are rising, and expenses are still high. Moreover, the price of silver has increased from 1.5 yuan to 1.75 yuan per tael. Silverware made of 80% silver costs 2.4 yuan per tael, including labor costs, or at least 2.1 to 2.2 yuan. The interest rate is much higher than usual, so it can be maintained without being worn out. The business of the Gold Exchange is not comparable to that of 1935. Replacing it are the Yarn, Cloth, Miscellaneous Grains, and Flour Exchanges. Whether they are shareholders or members, they are all overjoyed. The Miscellaneous Grains Exchange has even allocated 100,000 yuan to build a new market. After the listing of unified government bonds, the Securities Exchange has seen trading return from brilliance to plainness, but it is still in a small well-off situation. The silk and tea industries are also good. The sales of silk and satin clothing stores are particularly strong. Pawnbrokers found it difficult to clear the goods that were full of goods and reduced in price the year before last. Last year, they sold full and bought with additional profits, still fighting over each other. The foreign paper industry had an especially good encounter. They placed orders in the first half of the year and made a big profit in the second half of the year. Moreover, there was often no supply to meet the demand. Non-wholesale retailers all had to worry about not having goods. Therefore, the paper industry in this year all regretted ordering too little in the previous year. In addition, retail daily necessities stores have been touched by the rise in prices. However, since general purchasing power has not recovered and the unemployment problem has not been resolved, they have not made healthy progress. However, at the end of last year, all the inns and hotels were full, unlike the previous year when they offered 70% or 80% discounts and gave away one day for every day of stay, with no one caring. This can be seen as a sign of commercial benefit, because merchants often borrow hotels at the end and beginning of the year as a place for entertainment, and also solicit customers to promote business. Therefore, this year, when the commercial and industrial circles meet, they congratulate each other with "Congratulations on getting rich," with happy faces, unlike the previous year when they said the same thing, but their faces still had hesitation.</p>
<p>In general, those who bought into the upward market last year all made profits, while those who sold out inevitably missed the opportunity. In fact, the improvement of the market was due to the prosperity of the world's military industry and the advancement of national defense equipment, and China, which supplies the world with raw materials, has benefited from the residue. Secondly, the domestic consecutive years of famine were followed by a bumper harvest last year, which coincided with the urgent need for raw materials overseas, and the farmers, who had been exhausted for a long time, needed to supplement their needs, which led to a sudden increase in temporary needs. Thirdly, from the observation of retail business, the real purchasing power has not yet recovered, so the rise in prices seems to be due to the devaluation of the currency. As for this year's industry and commerce, inheriting the rising momentum of the past year, if there are no unexpected attacks, profits can be secured. There is a rumor in the market that this year's fifth day of the Lunar New Year coincides with the ancient saying "Gold Danger Danger." "Gold Danger Danger" please the God of Wealth, great profit, and the custom is based on the old first fourth night of the Lunar New Year please the God of Wealth, the fifth day to open the market. This year coincides with "Gold Danger Danger," so some merchants regard "The God of Wealth is in China this year" as a material for congratulating each other in the New Year (Note: There are two days of Gold Danger Danger this year, one is the fifth day of the first lunar month, and the other is April 29). Saying that it involves superstition is not worth taking, but we must know that Chinese industry and commerce have reached this point, and good fortune cannot solve the problem of getting rich. If you really want to get rich, you must take out your real skills and all your spirit; come out and deal with people, not only must the material be improved, but the spirit must also be transformed, otherwise even if there is a "God of Wealth," they will be unable to help.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market turns around, all thanks to winter</p>
<p>The actual sales of cotton yarn in 1936 were better than last year, but the purchasing power of all parties in the first half of the year was still sluggish, and the factories still had concerns about overproduction. Although the financial sector once searched in the yarn market, the market price rose, but the actual needs always had no signs of development, so the market conditions soon fell again. Later, in the autumn, because the whole country had abundant cotton and rice harvests, cloth began to be active first. Since cloth sales were smooth, yarn, which is a necessary raw material, improved accordingly. As for the yarn factories, in mid-July and August, because cotton was in the transition period between the old and new crops, some parties manipulated it with particular force, and the market price was raised to 52.5 yuan. The rise in cotton prices exceeded that of cloth, and yarn factories increased their shutdowns and reduced their work, and some were completely closed. Hankou also suffered from the same disease. 500,000 spindles of yarn and thread in Tianjin, North China, were purchased by Japanese merchants. The production volume was greatly reduced, and the inventory of yarn in Shanghai gradually decreased, shrinking from 80,000 bales to 23,000 bales. At this time, autumn sales began, and the factories suffered from a lack of yarn supply. The yarn in the exchange's warehouse became the object of competition for purchase by the Ke Bangs. Before long, the 30,000 bales of yarn were sold out, which shows the magnitude of the Ke Bangs' intake. The market almost became a situation where no yarn could be purchased, so they went a step further and purchased futures. Shenxin, Wing On, and other factories sold off more and more. Production could not meet demand. The yarn houses were eager for spot goods and had to advance silver to the factories to distribute stack soldiers. After October, the rising trend of yarn prices became more and more dramatic, from 230 yuan to 40 yuan, reaching outside 50 yuan. The phenomenon of customers paying for stack orders further proves the smooth sales of spot goods. As a result, the spot price of yarn in the market and the price of stack orders differed by as much as 10 to 20 yuan per piece. In fact, the yarn industry had been declining for five years, and the rural areas had been declining for years, and the cloth and yarn inventories in all areas had become increasingly exhausted. In the spring of 1935, the highest recorded inventory of yarn reached over 160,000 bales. Later, after the national government announced its currency reform policy, the financial situation stabilized. Now, thanks to the abundant harvest throughout the country, the purchasing power of the rural areas has been healthy, and the market situation that had been feared for several years has suddenly recovered. It is found that the total amount of spot yarn purchased by various Ke Bangs throughout the year was 363,250 bales, an increase of 56,299 bales compared to the 300,3951 bales of the previous year. Among them, the inland Ke Bangs purchased particularly strongly. Due to the smooth trade in cloth, the military unification of the two Guangs, and the demand for cloth in the southern corner, the intake was particularly strong. Therefore, the small cloth factories in Xichangcheng and other areas made a lot of profits. The total amount of spot yarn purchased throughout the year was 115,813 bales, more than double that of the previous year. Jiangsi Bang entered 51,060 bales, an increase of 28,910 bales. Tianjin Bang entered 36,045 bales, an increase of 23,920 bales. Only Guangdong Bang entered 60,793 bales, a decrease of 15,125 bales. It is found that the turnover in January was 22,130 bales, the turnover in February was 35,634 bales, the turnover in March was 32,531 bales, the turnover in April was 19,312 bales, the turnover in May was 22,635 bales, the turnover in June was 26,170 bales, the turnover in July was 19,630 bales, the turnover in August was 44,831 bales, the turnover in September was 47,642 bales, the turnover in October was 41,005 bales, the turnover in November was 32,225 bales, and the turnover in December was 185,500 bales, totaling 363,250 bales. The following is a list of the annual and previous year's purchases of each Bang (unit: bales):</p>
<p>In the spring and autumn, the standard cotton yarn market price hovered around the 200 yuan mark. Later, after the announcement of the Sino-US Monetary Agreement in May, it broke through the 200 yuan mark, reaching 193 yuan. At this time, there were often 30,000 bales of warehouse yarn, and the yarn market was under heavy pressure. Following this, the incident of Japanese residents being killed in China caused diplomatic tensions to intensify, and the market showed signs of unrest again. In addition, the acreage of cotton fields increased sharply throughout the country this year, and another bumper harvest was reported. The US cotton estimates released on August 8 were also higher than expected. Foreign raw materials showed signs of oversupply, and the decline in US cotton put more pressure on the yarn market. However, after October, due to the improvement in rural areas and the active trade in cloth from all directions, the sales of cotton yarn raw materials suddenly increased dramatically, and market prices soared, with two limit-up days. The sharpness of the surge was unprecedented in more than ten years. New peaks appeared one after another. At the same time, the Osaka Sanpin Yarn also created a top peak of 300 yuan. On November 5, it once again created a new record of 268 yuan since 1918. At the same time, the price of 20-count spot yarn soared by 15-16 yuan in one day, and the thread jumped by more than 20 yuan. The price even reached its peak. The business of the exchange developed greatly, and the turnover exceeded 1.5 times that of the previous year. The following is a table listing the highest and lowest prices and total turnover and delivery prices of the Standard Yarn throughout the year for reference:</p>
<p>Overseas Cotton Market During the Holiday</p>
<p>On the 6th (Saturday), the US cotton market opened with sluggish market conditions. Prices fell by 3-4 points in each month due to cotton farmers taking profits and bulls closing positions. Washington's intentions were uncertain. Afterwards, industry insiders bought heavily, and the market conditions reacted. However, profit-taking was very strong. It is rumored that Washington plans to purchase one million bales of non-deliverable cotton to alleviate the flood, and it is also rumored that 50,000 to 70,000 bales of cotton have been sold. The market closed firmly, with spot prices up one point and futures prices down one point to up three points. British cotton spot prices fell three points and futures prices fell one to two points. Sentiment in the Indian cotton market improved, but it was met with profit-taking. Later, due to the strength of the stock market and other commodities, market prices rose. Pingguoer rose 0.25 rupee, Omra was unchanged, and Bairoxi rose 0.25 to 0.5 rupee.</p>
<p>On the 8th (Monday), the US cotton market opened with firm market conditions. Except for the March contract, which fell six points due to overseas bulls closing positions, the remaining months rose two to eight points due to purchases by brokers and foreign merchants. Afterwards, old cotton was sold by cotton farmers, and market prices softened. New cotton buying was strong and continued to rise. The German goods exchange program is nearing completion, and trading is very smooth. The market closed steadily, with spot prices down five points, old cotton down two to five points, and new cotton up five to eleven points. British cotton spot prices rose three points and futures prices rose one point. Indian cotton rose initially on news that the US government would purchase one million bales of cotton to alleviate the flood, but then weakened due to the fall in Japanese yarn. Pingguoer fell one rupee, Omra fell 0.75 rupee, and Bairoxi rose 0.25 rupee.</p>
<p>On the 9th (Monday), the US cotton market opened with mixed market conditions, with each month falling one point to rising two points. In the early morning, bulls moved to the distant months, and cotton farmers sold the near months, and the market conditions were sluggish. Fortunately, industry insiders bought on the dip and were able to stand firm. The distant months were only increased by 10% due to the cotton fields, and there were not many sellers. Foreign merchants absorbed a lot, and the market always maintained a strong momentum. Then, the bulls closed positions and slightly weakened. At the close, it was heard that the west was too dry, and the government continued to manage, and the distant month's trading sentiment was very strong. Spot prices were unchanged and futures prices ranged from unchanged to up six points. British cotton spot and futures prices fell five points. Indian cotton was sold by short positions, but industry insiders bought in and Sanpin was strong. Later, old bulls sold off and the stock market was sluggish, and market prices fell slightly. Pingguoer fell 1.5 to 2 rupees, Omra fell 1.5 rupees, and Bairoxi fell 1.5 to 1.75 rupees.</p>
<p>On the 10th (Wednesday), the US cotton market opened with weak market conditions, with each month falling one to three points. In the early morning, the market conditions were sluggish, and the fluctuations were narrow. The main reasons for the price decline were the closing of positions by overnight bulls and small-scale short sales. Foreign merchants sold old cotton and bought new cotton. Afterwards, the wheat market and the stock market were strong, and industry insiders and short sellers bought in, and the market price rebounded. However, no one followed the buyers, and it eventually trended downward again due to the closing of positions and short sales by old bulls. New customers were lacking, and industry insiders watched. The market closed steadily, with spot prices down five points and futures prices down two to five points. British cotton spot prices fell two points and futures prices rose two to three points. Indian cotton fell initially due to the sluggish stock market and the closing of positions by old bulls, and then rebounded due to short covering. Pingguoer fell half a rupee, Omra fell 0.75 rupee, and Bairoxi fell one rupee.</p>
<p>On the 11th (Thursday), the US cotton market opened, and the cloth conditions were firm and strong, with prices rising three to eight points. The resolution of the automobile workers' strike and the good news from Liverpool did not affect the market. Only the industry insiders bought old cotton, and some foreign merchants needed it, and the market price rose gradually. According to reports from Washington, the cotton rollover shown in the proposed management plan cannot be said to be a large increase in production. However, the new cotton in the long term was not noticed. At the close, industry insiders bought in at a limit price, and the market trend was still firm. Spot prices rose six points, and futures prices rose three to seven points. British cotton spot prices rose seven points, and futures prices rose one to two points. The weather in the Gorak Cotton area of Indian cotton was uncertain, and short covering met with a small amount of selling. Later, it was firm due to the resolution of the automobile workers' strike in the United States. Pingguoer rose one rupee, Omra rose one to 1.25 rupees, and Bairoxi rose 1.25 rupees.</p>
<p>On the 12th (Friday), the US cotton market was closed, and only the New Orleans cotton market was open, with each month falling two to five points. British cotton spot prices fell two points and futures prices rose one to two points. Indian cotton bulls continued to close positions. Later, some buyers bought Indian cotton to offset the sales in Liverpool, and the market conditions became stable. Pingguoer rose 0.5 to 0.75 rupee, Omra fell 1.25 rupees, and Bairoxi fell 0.75 to 1 rupee.</p>
<p>Osaka Electric Sanpin, ten-period yarn, each month is lower than the previous issue by 50 cents to 3 yuan, the near month is 250 yuan and 40 cents, the distant month is 145 yuan and 60 cents cotton fell 50 to 35 cents, the near month is 74 yuan and 60 cents the month is 76 yuan and 55 cents.</p>
<p>Indian Cotton Inventory Is Abundant</p>
<p>—Exceeding Export Needs—</p>
<p>Although the market atmosphere was weak last week, the fluctuations were not large. Due to the Japanese control of foreign exchange, the inventory in Karachi was abundant, exceeding export needs. However, once normal conditions are restored, inquiries can be improved. Lancashire and the mainland are both interested. Japanese buyers are all offsetting previous amounts, and factory needs are mediocre.</p>
<p>The arrival of Luo Xi goods is gradually increasing. First-class goods are sold mixed with low-grade goods. The following is a statistical appendix for last week (unit: thousand packages).</p>
<p>Attached is the export volume of Rangoon cotton last week</p>
<p>Bombay Electric on the 8th, the amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week totaled 678 tons, of which 280 tons went to Kobe, 179 tons went to Osaka, 89 tons went to Anvity, 20 tons went to Hamburg, and 8 tons went to Melbourne. Financial</p>
<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>The Standard Gold Market Was Slightly Weak During the Holiday, and Foreign Exchange Was Slightly Tight</p>
<p>During the holiday period, the gold market saw a slight decline due to the fall in pure gold. The foreign exchange market saw a healthier appetite for stomach from banks, but the final trend seemed soft. The following is a brief description of the gold market on the 8th and 9th and the foreign exchange market for three days.</p>
<p>On the 8th (Monday), the gold market fell 70 cents as soon as it opened due to the small drop of one penny in pure gold. The morning opening was 1153.20 yuan. Due to the purchases of Dafeng, Hengyu, and Xinxiang, the noon closing rose to 3.50 yuan. There was not much change in the aftermarket. The opening price was 3.40 yuan, and Yongli sold off, once falling to 3.20 yuan. The closing price was 1153.30 yuan, fluctuating only 30 cents throughout the day. As a result, it fell back 60 cents.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market opened flat. Although foreign firms sold after the opening, the results were still unchanged due to the healthy appetite for stomach from banks. Midway through, the US dollar was settled by Mobil, and the Chinese merchants replenished the Japanese exchange, which showed a soft trend. However, the closing price was still the recent British exchange rate of one shilling, five pence, 9375, the US exchange rate of 29.75 yuan, the forward shilling of 53125, and the US dollar of 29.625 yuan. On this day, Chinese merchants only replenished more than 200,000 yuan of Japanese gold.</p>
<p>On the 9th (Tuesday), the gold market continued to fall by half a penny due to the continued decline in pure gold. However, since there were not many sellers, the morning opening rose slightly by a few cents to 1153.10 yuan. Dachangxiang, Yuanmao, Yongdacheng sold bars, once seeing 3.20 yuan. Fuxing, Yongqia, Fengyong bought bars. It rose to 4 yuan. Yongfeng Dachangxiang continued to cut more, and fell to 3.50 yuan. Fuxingyong bought again, and the noon closing was 3.80 yuan. The aftermarket opening was 3.60 yuan. Dadecheng closed, and the closing price was 1153.30 yuan, the same as the previous closing. There were eight corners of ups and downs throughout the day, but the boiled red was more expensive. Dadecheng sold to Hankou Bang according to an additional 15 yuan.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market opened flat again in the morning. Banks made deals with each other. Midway through, it was determined that Chinese merchants were still replenishing East Exchange, so the Japanese gold continued to show a firm trend. Although the result did not change, because there were not many positions, if Chinese merchants had transactions, it would be difficult to settle. Although the closing exchange rate was fair, it belonged to a matching market.</p>
<p>The gold market was closed on the 10th (Wednesday), and the foreign exchange market was lively instead. Chinese merchants sold quite a lot, but because the demand from banks exceeded the supply, and foreign firms also settled shillings, the recent process became tight. At the close, the recent British exchange rate was one shilling, two pence, 5625 US dollars, 29.71875 yuan, and the forward British exchange rate was half a penny, with the US exchange rate at 59375, which was 0.03125 tighter than the previous close. The Japanese exchange rate remained the same. The spot selling price was 104.25 yuan, and the buying price was 104.625 yuan.</p>
<p>During the holiday period for the February public list of the Gold Exchange, only 14 bars were sold by Yongfeng to Qiafengyong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Domestic Sugar Inventory Increases by More Than 30,000 Packages</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>New Lead Wire Prices Drop by 1.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Due to the scarcity of new lead wire arrivals, the market was brisk, with the standard reaching as high as 16.5 yuan. However, with the end of the lunar year approaching, all industries are closing accounts. It has been found that new goods have already been loaded in the last few days of the year, and hoarders are releasing their stockpiles, so sentiment is relatively sluggish, and market prices have also eased. Calculations show that the opening price is 14 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kilograms), a sharp drop of 1.5 yuan compared to before. Only 400 to 500 dan were transacted. However, the markets for coarse and fine grades are still holding, with prices remaining around 14 yuan and 20 yuan respectively. Apart from these, the markets for old lead wire and fire-damaged wire have seen little change due to good sentiments among those seeking to acquire goods.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items</h3>
<p>Large Shipment of Japanese Goods Arrives in Shanghai - Regular Schedule Insufficient, Additional Temporary Sailings Added</p>
<p>Japanese goods are arriving continuously. During the period when this newspaper was not published, in addition to irregular Japanese vessels (i.e., those with unscheduled sailings), three regular ships arrived, carrying a total of over 9,350 tons. This includes 7,000 bags of sugar, over 9,700 pieces of iron bars and iron sheets, over 1,330 pieces of copper wire, over 1,430 boxes of salt sulfate, and over 30,000 pieces of various goods such as bleaching powder, salted fish, and sulfur, it is said.</p>

<h3>What Attitude Should We Have When Reading?</h3>
<p>— Nian Kang</p>
<p>Learning the Spirit of Life from Three Small Animals</p>
<p>Children, what attitude do you usually have when you read? Here are three kinds of spirit that are unique in the lives of three small animals, to give you inspiration and reference for your reading attitude:</p>
<p>(1) Ants Foraging: The spirit of ants foraging for food is simply one of hard work and dedication, reaching everywhere. Although their bodies are small, their strength is great; their belief in survival is very strong, willing to sacrifice the individual for the group, unwilling to give up the original goal. Their lives are about overcoming difficulties through hard work. The attitude to reading should learn from the spirit of ants foraging, to collect materials, to make decisions, to work hard!</p>
<p>(2) Silkworms Spinning Silk: "The spring silkworm spins silk until it dies," which is a spirit of sacrificing oneself for spinning silk. The attitude to reading should be "focused", "thorough", and make in-depth research, burying oneself in hard work; moreover, although silkworms spin a lot of silk, it is very systematic and organized, and finding the silk thread can lead to its unravelling, so the reading attitude should have the ability to organize materials!</p>
<p>(3) Bees Making Honey: Bees making honey is an act of storing food. In the climate and environment of winter, they cannot get food, so they work hard to collect flowers and make honey early. Reading should also start early, seeking more knowledge, preparing for application when needed; and bees collect flowers by taking the essence and removing the dross. Reading must also be based on this attitude, with the ability to judge and distinguish right from wrong!</p>
<h3>Why are Chimneys in Factories and Businesses Built Extraordinarily High?</h3>
<p>— Jiang Man</p>
<p>After 4 p.m., Mr. Wang went into the city on business and took us to visit Minsheng Factory along the way.</p>
<p>Before we even reached Minsheng Factory, the factory's tall chimney had already caught our eye. We had visited many factories before, and we remembered that their chimneys were all extraordinarily tall, even the lowest ones were several zhang (approximately 3 meters) high. What is the reason for this? I asked Mr. Wang.</p>
<p>"You ask a good question!" Mr. Wang said, "See if any of you can answer it?"</p>
<p>Yang Baichuan replied: "I think, when the chimney is high, the coal can be burned more easily; when the coal can be burned more easily, it can save coal. I wonder if that's right?"</p>
<p>Mr. Wang immediately smiled and said, "That's right! That's right! Saving coal, that's one point, is there anything else?"</p>
<p>Yang Baichuan continued to think, and we were also thinking silently. But we couldn't figure it out. After a while, Mr. Wang said, "There is another reason, let me tell you: when burning coal, there must be a kind of carbon dust, black smoke, and stinking gas spewing out of the chimney. These things are extremely harmful to our bodies. At this time, if they have very high chimneys, those black smoke, coal dust, and stench will be blown away by the wind at a high place; otherwise, if their chimneys are too low, it's a minor matter that they themselves use coal uneconomically, but the nearby residents will suffer greatly. Isn't this an extremely dangerous thing?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes!" We listened attentively, and slowly paced along, unknowingly arriving at the entrance of the factory.</p>
<h3>Crucian Carp</h3>
<p>— Zhong Mei</p>
<p>This afternoon, Xiaomin's aunt came from the countryside to visit Xiaomin's mother, and brought several crucian carp as a gift for Xiaomin, so he was very happy, waiting in the kitchen to see how his mother cooked them. When the cooking started, Xiaomin asked his mother: "Mother, what's inside the crucian carp's belly?"</p>
<p>"There are five kinds of structures inside the crucian carp's belly: 1. Circulatory and respiratory systems. The circulatory system is very simple, composed of one auricle and one ventricle. The respiratory system uses gills, and the mouth and gill slits can be opened and closed to each other. 2. Digestive system: Teeth grow in the upper and lower cheeks of the oral cavity, the esophagus is very thin and short, connected to the stomach below, followed by the intestine, where the intestine coils, there are gallbladder, liver, and spleen. There is a swim bladder on the chest, abdomen, and back sides, which is divided into front and back parts because the center is slightly narrow, and connects to the esophagus. 3. Excretory and reproductive systems. The excretory system has two kidneys. Reproductive system: Males have two testicles, females have two ovaries. 4. Nervous system; the sense of smell is very keen, the eyes have no eyelids, the ears have inner ears, the brain is undeveloped, the midbrain is larger than the cerebrum. 5. Skeleton and muscles: The skeleton is all hard bones, the structure of the skull is more complicated. Muscles: Unlike other animals, it is composed of many L-shaped muscle segments, attached to the left and right of the spine, and can be stretched and flexed at will."</p>
<p>"Then what kinds of fins does the crucian carp have? What are their functions?"</p>
<p>"On both sides of the front end of the torso are called pectoral fins; at the rear end are called pelvic fins. Their function is to be able to change direction when swimming, and slowly propel forward. On the back ridge is the dorsal fin, behind the anus is the anal fin. Their function is to be able to maintain the stability and uprightness of the body. At the tail, it's called the caudal fin, and its function is also to change direction."</p>
<p>"Then what other functions does the crucian carp have besides being eaten by us?"</p>
<p>"Their bones and scales can be made into fish fertilizer and fish glue, which are very useful in agriculture and industry."</p>
<h3>Ants and Lions</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>There were many lions living on a very high cliff, and many ants living at the foot of the mountain. One day, the Ant King summoned many ants to a meeting because food was scarce at the foot of the mountain. The Ant King chaired the meeting and explained the reason for the meeting, so many ants discussed it one after another, but there was still no proper solution.</p>
<p>While they were discussing, the Ant King suddenly saw the Lion King walking on the top of the mountain. The Ant King said to the Lion King: "Because food is scarce at the foot of the mountain, we ask you to send a lion down every day. If you don't allow it, then we will kill all the lions on the mountain together." The Lion King listened to its words and sneered, answering: "Do you weaklings also want to eat our powerful lions? It's just a dream." After the Lion King finished speaking, he left without looking back.</p>
<p>The Ant King ordered many ants to bore through the foot of the mountain. The ants worked very hard to bore into the foot of the mountain. Sure enough, in less than a few days, the foot of the mountain was shaking. While many lions were sound asleep, the cliff collapsed with a loud crash, and many lions died an unnatural death. From then on, they no longer lacked food.</p>
<p>Although this is a fairy tale, it shows that unity can overcome all tyranny, and hard work can overcome all difficulties.</p>
<h3>Bees and Butterflies</h3>
<p>— Zhu Chengxi</p>
<p>Bees hum and buzz,</p>
<p>Singing happy tunes,</p>
<p>"Work hard in spring and summer,</p>
<p>Making plenty of honey,</p>
<p>No need to worry or fret,</p>
<p>Autumn and winter are still warm and full."</p>
<p>Butterflies fly anxiously,</p>
<p>Worrying about enduring cold and hunger,</p>
<p>"Knowing only how to play in the summer,</p>
<p>Leaves fall and flowers fly in the autumn,</p>
<p>Now with no clothes or food,</p>
<p>It's so miserable to think about?"</p>
<h3>The Child Who Wasn't Afraid of Death</h3>
<p>— Lu Zhonghong</p>
<p>This story occupies the most glorious page in the history of the Franco-Prussian War. Apart from a few children who already know it, most children, I'm afraid, even if they've heard it, have already forgotten it. Now, I don't mind repeating it and writing it out again to provide a good reference for our children during this national crisis.</p>
<p>During the Franco-Prussian War, the French army retreated to a small town. This small town needed to be defended, because behind the town lay a lush forest, and the enemy's movements could not be seen from the town. So the French general begged a child who had not run away, pointing to a large tree in the town and saying:</p>
<p>"Can you climb this big tree? See if there are any traces of the enemy in the forest behind?"</p>
<p>"What can't I do? I often climb trees."</p>
<p>After the child finished speaking, he climbed up the tree and sat on a thick branch, looking around. The general said:</p>
<p>"What do you see?"</p>
<p>"What I see is a Prussian flag, waving in the forest."</p>
<p>"What else do you see?"</p>
<p>"Wait a moment, let me climb up a little further - oh, ... there are many Prussian soldiers."</p>
<p>At this moment, suddenly there was a "bang" sound, and a bullet was fired from the forest. The French army was horrified, but the general calmly said to the child:</p>
<p>"Come down! Good boy, they saw you, it's very dangerous."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, I'm hiding in the leaves, they can't hit me."</p>
<p>"Then what are they doing now?"</p>
<p>The child did not answer, and tried his best to climb up the tree, swaying and scouting. Although the enemy's bullets continued to shoot at him, the general tried his best to stop him. He was not afraid at all, and after all, he reported the situation he had scouted:</p>
<p>"They are all moving, shouldering their guns - ah, they are divided into two teams again, one team is going east, one team is going west - ah, they are running towards us along both sides of the river."</p>
<p>"Enough, enough, brave child, come down quickly, it's dangerous, we have to move too."</p>
<p>The child still wanted to climb higher, but bullets came in bursts. At first, his calf was hit by a bullet, and later his abdomen was also pierced by a bullet. Only then did he relax his hands, and fell straight down like a wounded bird. His hot blood flowed profusely, and his face changed color, but he still moved his small mouth and muttered:</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, I'm doing it for our France."</p>
<p>The general was busy deploying troops, and had no time to pay attention to him. He lost too much blood, lay painfully on the ground, his brows furrowed, his eyes weakly open, his small mouth trembling, as if anxiously waiting for something. When the cheers of "Long live France" and the shouts of "Brave child, your spirit will never die" reached his ears when the French army returned in triumph after annihilating the Prussian army, he only saw the general standing solemnly in front of him, telling him, "Respectable child, I wish you ascend to heaven, we have won completely." After saying this, a trace of a satisfied smile appeared on the child's ashen face, and he slept peacefully wrapped in the national flag.</p>
<h3>Convection</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>On Sunday, Min'er asked his brother to visit the factory, because he had never been to a factory before. His brother, wanting him to gain more knowledge, readily agreed to his request. After they walked for a while, Min'er saw many tall chimneys in the distance. He knew that the chimneys were in the factory, but comparing them to the chimney in his own home, they appeared even taller, which made him wonder.</p>
<p>"Brother, aren't they silly? What's the use of building such tall chimneys? What if they get blown down by a big wind? Look, the chimney in my house is low and short, no matter how strong the wind is, no one can blow it down?"</p>
<p>"You're being silly again. All the equipment in the factory is beneficial to the factory itself, so of course the chimneys built so high are no exception. But what is the benefit of building them so high? It turns out that it makes the air have a kind of convection, which allows the furnace to have a continuous supply of fresh air, so it can burn vigorously. You need to know that combustion needs fresh air the most, because fresh air has more oxygen, and oxygen can help combustion, save fuel, and also make the fire in the furnace very strong.</p>
<p>"What is convection? What's the proof?"</p>
<p>"We've done a convection experiment before, and I can tell you about it: First, we took a glass bottle, filled half of it with water, then put in a few grains of red dye, and then burned it on a lamp. We could see the red color rising from the center of the bottom of the bottle and falling to the sides of the bottle. This happened several times up and down, and the water in the whole bottle turned red. This is because the water at the bottom of the bottle was heated and rose, and the water on the sides of the bottle was not as hot, so it fell, and brought the red water above down. So this went on and on, and finally the water in the whole bottle turned red, and at the same time the water in the whole bottle was also hot. This leads to a conclusion: The phenomenon of heat circulating up and down with the water is called convection, but it is not only limited to water, other things can also do it." Cong'er continued, "I want to ask you: Why does the refrigerator in my house put ice on the top of the box in the summer? This is also a very good example of convection. Putting ice on the top of the refrigerator makes the air around the ice cold, and when the air gets cold, it goes down, but the air at the bottom of the box is very hot, because it's in the hot summer, so it rises. This way, up and down, after a short time, the refrigerator is filled with cold air, and the food can be prevented from getting hot and spoiling."</p>
<p>They stopped discussing when they arrived at the factory gate and went inside to visit.</p>
<h3>Talking about Cows in the Year of the Ox (with illustrations)</h3>
<p>— Dong Xun</p>
<p>This year is the Year of the Ox, so let's take it as a title and talk about it! The cow is a very important livestock among domestic animals. The total number of cows produced in the world is about 510 million, which is about one-third of the world's total population (the world's total population is about 1.8 billion). Among so many cows, according to their use, they can be roughly divided into three major categories: dairy breeds, meat breeds, and draft breeds.</p>
<p>Famous dairy cows include: 1. Holstein ㊀ This cow originated in the Netherlands, and was later improved in the United States. In addition to the dairy breed, there is also a dual-purpose dairy and meat breed. Its coat color has black patches on the back, and the abdomen, tail end, and limbs are all white. Its milk yield and weight exceed those of other cows, so it is raised in many parts of the world. 2. Ayrshire ㊂ This cow originated in Ayrshire, England. Its coat color is white with yellowish-brown spots, and its horns are high and upright. Its milk is suitable for making cheese. 3. Jersey This cow originated on Jersey Island in the English Channel, with a coat color of grayish-brown or blackish-brown and a white nose. Its milk is suitable for making butter. 4. Guernsey This cow is produced on Guernsey Island in the English Channel. Its body shape is similar to that of the Jersey, and its coat color is light yellow with brown, ochre, and white spots. Its milk quality is very rich!</p>
<p>The most famous meat cow is the Shorthorn ㊃. This cow originated in England and was originally bred from a dual-purpose dairy and meat breed. Its shape is as stout and fat as a pig, and its horns are very short. Male cows weigh from 1,200 kg to 1,400 kg, and its coat color is gray-white with some reddish-brown bristles. The meat tastes very good. Others such as the Hereford of England, weighing from 800 kg to 1,000 kg, the Aberdeen-Angus, weighing from 600 kg to 900 kg, and the Galloway, weighing around 800 kg, are all world-famous meat cows.</p>
<p>Draft cows include: 1. Yellow Cattle ㊅ This cow originated in China and various parts of Asia, and is generally used for cultivation or pulling carts. 2. Buffalo, Buffaloes are divided into Indian Buffalo ㊇ and American Buffalo ㊆. American buffaloes are mostly wild, with red and black colors; Indian buffaloes also have two types, one is wild, produced in the Malay Peninsula, and the other is domesticated, found in China, India, Taiwan, Malaysia, and various parts of Asia. This buffalo has a grayish-black or black coat color, and has very long horns (about one meter) on its head. The meat quality is very poor, but it is very strong, and is very suitable for plowing fields and carrying goods, because it likes to bathe in the river, so it is named buffalo! 3. The yak is a specialty of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China and is used to carry goods and operate. Its strength is very great! 4. Brown Swiss ㊁ This cow originated in the northeastern part of Switzerland in a cold climate. It is very strong and suitable for breeding in cold mountainous areas. Its coat color is brown-brown, and it is a Swiss mountain draft cattle breed. 5. Devon ㊄ This is the earliest improved breed of cattle in the world, originating in England, with a whole body of reddish-brown color and a smooth and soft coat. It is lively and vigorous, suitable for agricultural operations, its meat quality is also good, and its milk quality is also abundant, and because it is strong, it is used for bullfighting in Spain.</p>
<h3>If Your Clothes Catch Fire</h3>
<p>— Qiong Bai</p>
<p>Children, if your clothes catch fire, how will you put it out? Here, I will introduce you to a few very convenient methods:</p>
<p>㊀ Be calm. Since your clothes have already caught fire, panicking will not help. The proper way is to try to put it out. Do not run or jump around, because this will only make the fire more intense.</p>
<p>㊁ Flames always go upwards, so when clothes catch fire, the face and hair are in the most dangerous position. You should immediately lie down on the ground, so that your face and hair will not be injured, and roll on the ground to reduce the flames.</p>
<p>㊂ We know that combustion requires oxygen, so we can also use this principle to put out the fire. Quickly take a quilt, blanket, or something similar, and tightly wrap your body, so that it is isolated from the air. The flame will go out because there is no oxygen supply. When wrapping, start from the head and neck and wrap downwards, otherwise if you wrap from below, the flame will surge upwards, burning your eyebrows, hair, and face.</p>
<p>Children's Creations</p>
<h3>Cockfight</h3>
<p>— Xie Jiasheng, 5th Grade Student, Zhiben Elementary School</p>
<p>This morning, when I got up, after washing, I was reading at home. Suddenly I heard someone outside shouting: "Look at that fierce one! Look at that fierce one"! I went out to take a look, oh! It turned out to be a rooster from the east neighbor fighting with a rooster from my house. At first, the east neighbor's chicken fought more and more bravely, and the chicken in my house gave way everywhere. Later, the east neighbor's chicken took an inch and wanted a mile, and was not satisfied. The chicken in my house knew that in order to survive, it had to cheer up and make up its mind to "fight to the death" to fight a decisive battle with it. After all, the east neighbor's chicken lost, and the chicken in my house won. I watched for a while, and then went home to write.</p>
<p>Later, the east neighbor's chicken never dared to invade again.</p>
<h3>Righteousness (4)</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>In August of 1826, a small schooner named "Magpie" was sailing in this sea area, commanded by a young first mate, Edward Smith. They were searching for a pirate ship that had been rampant off the west coast of Cuba for a long time. The weather was very hot that day. At dusk, the "Magpie" anchored near the rocks of Colorados. At eight o'clock, a gentle breeze rose from the west, and the sails were unfurled. However, in less than an hour, the wind shifted to the south, and a small plume of greyish-yellow smoke could be seen in the moonlight. This was a sign of impending danger, as all seafarers knew. So, First Mate Smith immediately rushed to the deck and ordered the sails to be furled, preparing to resist the storm with all their might.</p>
<p>The clouds quickly multiplied, and within seconds, all was silent. Then, a charging, roaring sound came, first from afar, but in an instant, it grew closer and louder. The sea, which had been as calm as a lake, was now suddenly pushed by a black wall, which crashed into a large mass of white foam, flying like snowflakes. At that moment, it hit their ship! Amidst the roar of the raging waves, the first mate shouted to cut down the masts quickly, but it was too late. Their ship had already tilted to one side, and in the blink of an eye, it sank completely! A second mate named Melder, in a flash of lightning, saw his companions struggling in the water. He swam towards the rapids above the sunken ship and grabbed a paddle, then a second. The hurricane, having completed its work, blew away. The sea then calmed down again, as if the struggle with the waves had been just a dream.</p>
<p>Melder held his breath and listened for any sound from his companions nearby. After a while, he exhaled, because he heard a voice asking who was there. It was First Mate Smith and six other companions, who had grabbed a floating lifeboat. The other sailors, upon seeing this, were overjoyed and rushed towards it. Soon, twenty-four men were hanging onto the boat, with some lying on the keel. As a result, the lifeboat completely lost its effectiveness and was merely floating on the water.</p>
<p>First Mate Smith ordered them to let go together so that the boat could right itself. They obeyed the order and let go. Then, Smith sent two men into the boat to use their hats to bail out the water. He also told the others to hang onto the edge of the boat to reduce the weight so that everyone could get on board. Unexpectedly, while they were bailing water, a sailor suddenly cried out, saying he saw a shark's fin. Everyone panicked, fearing they would be eaten by the fish, and they all crowded into the boat. But with too much force, they capsized the boat again. The first mate firmly ordered them back into the water and to right the boat again. He also told them to vigorously move their legs in the water to keep the sharks away. Everything was going well, and four people could now fit in the boat. After dawn, hope was especially high, but around ten o'clock, someone shouted again: "Shark! Shark!" They saw not just one, but as many as fourteen or fifteen. Immediately, there was even greater panic, and they capsized the boat again. First Mate Smith quickly used a calm and firm voice to stop the sailors from panicking. He sent two men onto the boat again, and the others hung on outside. The sharks initially seemed to be playing around, swimming close and rubbing against the sailors' bodies, some even swimming over the boat. Finally, one man cried out in pain because a shark had bitten his leg. Once the fish tasted blood, there was no hope for that man. Smith held onto the stern of the boat, trying to calm the sailors and encouraging those in the boat to bail water quickly, while comforting those nearby to wait patiently so that everyone could get on board and escape danger.</p>

<h3>Six Days</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>As usual, this publication takes a six-day break for the winter vacation. The six days have passed in the blink of an eye, and today is the seventh day. According to custom, we will meet with readers every day again. This is originally a very interesting thing, but today, in the Lunar New Year, it is still the first time meeting with readers. What should we talk about with you all? National affairs? The matter that the Chinese people pay the most attention to is the Shaanxi Incident. Now, the Xi'an Incident has been completely resolved. This matter can certainly be reported to the Chinese people, but this matter had a trend of being completely resolved six days ago, so the news can be said to be old news and has no value. In addition to the upcoming opening of the Third Plenary Session tomorrow, there are no other new or joyful things that can be told. International affairs? The situation is changing unpredictably, and it is still in the "wait and see what happens next" category. Since there is nothing to say, there is no need to say it. What I am talking about now is the situation during the six days in my hometown. If I want to tell you about my life situation during those six days, I can summarize it in one sentence: I only spent the Lunar New Year busily.</p>
<p>However, the Lunar New Year is also said to be the Yin-Yang New Year. This kind of New Year has already been named as the abolished calendar and has been abolished for a long time. Even if one spends this troublesome New Year, what could be so busy about it, what could there be to do? Little did they know that the facts tell us that it is not so. In fact, the mainland only has the Lunar New Year and does not know the Solar New Year. The first reason for this is the ingrained habits of society, and the second is the stubbornness of the mind. Habits are not easy to eliminate in a short time, and the mind cannot be changed in a short time either. It is very easy to say, but very difficult to do. I will now write about some of the difficult situations in making changes. I cannot say it is based on experience, but it can be said that it happened because of circumstances.</p>
<p>Let me explain these situations one by one. As the abolished calendar's New Year approaches, relatives and friends will send New Year cakes or gifts. After the 20th of the lunar month, the sound of firecrackers offered to the Kitchen God and the Earth God will be endless, like arrows fired in succession. Assuming you have a weak mind, you will definitely not be able to close your eyes all night. Once the New Year arrives, there will be even more colorful displays. Every house will have tall red candles and bright red satin chair covers, which must be stretched taut, creating a magnificent scene. If you walk into someone's house, you will be served exquisite fruit platters with sweets, fruits, cakes, and other delicacies. The servants will also keep shouting "Congratulations" several times. At this time, how can I not stretch out my "waist" and dig out some money from my pocket? Also, when you meet friends on the street or receive relatives at home, they will bow their heads and offer auspicious words of "Congratulations and may you get rich," which are used appropriately. At this time, can you not say a word? If you walk on the street, no matter how big or small the stores are, many will display a 'closed for the New Year' sign and serve you a "closed door soup". You will only hear the sound of New Year gongs and drums, and almost nothing can be bought except in a few tobacco, paper, candy, and fruit shops. If you go to the temples, the people burning incense will be like mountains and seas, crowded and impassable, and the stalls of small businesses will be packed tightly, selling paintings, clay Buddhas, sweets, bowls, firecrackers, and vermicelli soup. Everywhere you look, there's something for sale. In such an environment, how can you jump out of the environment and not celebrate the New Year? Unless you don't live in this society. Assuming you don't live in this society and go to another society, it will be the same. Assuming you are not dominated by the environment, they celebrate their New Year, and you celebrate yours, people will either say you are being pretentious or say you are a monster. I ask you, do you have great ability to break this environment and resist this society? Not to mention the countryside, yesterday I came to Shanghai, the so-called New York of the East, and counted how many shops were open. If you go to the City God Temple, don't even think about having any room to stand.</p>
<h3>Happiness</h3>
<p>— Ximei</p>
<p>Everyone wants happiness, but happiness can never come to find people; instead, people must go to find happiness.</p>
<p>The first condition for finding happiness is to have a strong body. People with weak bodies will not be happy even if they have wealth, fame, or status. Therefore, happiness is like a large building, and good health is the cornerstone of building the building. Since the relationship between good health and happiness is so important, people who want to find happiness must first improve their own bodies. If they suffer from anemia, they should take blood-boosting medicines. If they have a tendency to lung disease, they should take cod liver oil. Wuzhou Pharmacy's Zilai Blood and Benpai Cod Liver Oil are the most effective! Taking them regularly will make your body healthier day by day, and your happiness will be boundless!</p>
<h3>Confessions of a Socialite</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>She is a socialite, and most people admire her very much.</p>
<p>Her face is so beautiful, and her skin is very fair. Her hair is very shiny and always emits a fragrant scent. Especially her teeth, which are as white as jade.</p>
<p>Someone asked her about her life, and she said: "Others must think that I am studying makeup, but in fact, my makeup is very simple. After washing my face, I apply 'Yipinxiang'. I only spray '131 Hair Tonic' on my hair, and I brush my teeth with '131 Toothpaste' every morning and evening. That's it."</p>
<p>She also said: "The era of using foreign goods is over. Using domestic goods in social circles is both beautiful and economical. Therefore, the several cosmetics I use are all products of Wu Da Pharmacy."</p>
<h3>Road Hero</h3>
<p>— Luo Caiqing</p>
<p>Once the New Year arrives, there is indeed a New Year atmosphere. Even people who are overwhelmed by debts and worldly affairs on New Year's Eve, when they raise their hands and shout "Congratulations and may you get rich," seem to be reborn.</p>
<p>Celebrating the New Year is naturally joyful. It not only shows that everyone has aged by one year, but also that the future in the new year is unlimited. The owners in the shops want to welcome the God of Wealth, while the shop assistants take out gongs and drums and play them from the first day of the New Year until the Lantern Festival. It is possible that they will suddenly get excited and take a stroll on the road, which is quite lively, because the road during the New Year seems to be their territory. Playing New Year gongs and drums is still being responsible. Another type is to throw money crackers at women, "With a loud bang, clapping and laughing." It is a wonderful contrast to the ancient heroes "drawing their swords to help when they see injustice on the road." They are called: "Road Heroes," that's what it means. There is no intention to be deliberately mean to them.</p>
<p>I used to read many articles about "pushing," "kicking," and "trampling" in the newspaper. Now "throwing" may be a new kind of "art," because being thrown at, pushed, kicked, or trampled on can cause serious injury or make one blush. However, "throwing" only targets women.</p>
<p>I rarely spend the New Year in Shanghai. Even if I spend the New Year in Shanghai, I rarely go to the road to "join the fun." So, seeing "a loud bang" I thought it was a strange thing. Later I learned that "throwing money crackers" has been around for a long time. It is said that the road regulations in the concessions are quite thoughtful regarding rickshaw drivers' permits, such as walking on the left, traffic lights, and so on, because there is a risk of hitting pedestrians, but there is no prohibition on throwing money crackers, especially during the New Year, which is already a common "embellishment." This grace seems to be more closely linked to the name "Road Heroes."</p>
<p>But after seeing this situation, I began to think wildly. Playing New Year gongs and drums is a "fun for all," and people lean out of the windows when they hear you playing "clang clang," and those walking on the road suddenly stop to watch you dance, isn't that already "heroic" enough? But some people still want to throw money crackers. Being scolded as "a thousand cuts" may be regarded as "flirting," which is quite to the heroes' liking. If one day it "seriously injures the body," then instead of becoming a "hero," they become a prisoner, which seems too discouraging. In the end</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>I blamed those who made the money crackers. And I did read a piece of "heartwarming" news: a local man, Xu BaoBao, 26 years old, and his younger brother, BaoXing, 23 years old, who both lived at No. 146, Lane 14, Qiujiang Road, Hongkou, recently bought a large amount of raw materials for making firecrackers as partners, and worked day and night at home to make them, preparing to sell them during the abolished Lunar New Year in order to make a profit. Yesterday at 1:30 pm, when the two were making the firecrackers, the raw materials suddenly exploded. The two failed to escape, and both suffered severe burns on their faces and hands. Later, their family members took them to the hospital for treatment. It is said that Xu BaoBao was seriously injured and his life may be in danger.</p>
<p>This statement defends the road heroes a bit. However, when people buy scrap copper and iron to make bombs and buy silk cocoons to make airplane parachutes, I can't help but think of the artillery fire of the January 28th Incident, which is similar to "a loud bang." The Xu brothers did not die from the artillery fire of the January 28th Incident, but died from "the sudden explosion of firecracker raw materials," while those road heroes still aimed at the chests of women and threw money crackers, "With a loud bang, clapping and laughing." It feels like five years have passed too quickly!</p>
<h3>Hall</h3>
<p>— Zhongbing</p>
<p>All there is is empty silence. Like a devout cultivator, the hall stands solemn and speechless all day.</p>
<p>On the fifty-two difficult stone steps, the hall is built in the distant void. Straight and slanted lines, even and clean arcs; the tile ridges as neat as fish scales, the orderly columned corridors, and the ancient, decaying wind chimes at the corners of the eaves, create a classic harmony.</p>
<p>Two stone lions with dancing claws and bared teeth guard the entrance of the hall, but all there is is empty silence. Inside the hall doors, the misty clouds of smoke, the fragrant clouds of smoke, and the clouds of light poured out by the ever-burning lamps diffuse. The dim light of the ever-burning lamps reflected on the hemp-yellow curtain is like the desolate light of the lamps in front of the feet of the dead before entering the coffin, reflected on the plain curtain of mourning, quietly and coldly congealing into a single piece.</p>
<p>Through the tassel-like embroidered edges of the curtain, the wooden idols stand humbly in the square inch of the Buddhist niche, and the clay idols sit on the pure and transcendent lotus petals. And the eyes of all the idols contain the classical ingenuity of the sculptor, releasing merciful gazes and caressing the devout disciples to transcend them.</p>
<p>The misty clouds of smoke, the fragrant clouds of smoke, and the clouds of light poured out by the ever-burning lamps, the hall is being smoked, infected, and enduring the cold loneliness and dead silence. In the air of the Buddhist hall, silence is like a delicate amplifier, amplifying the subtle sounds of the night lessons into loud and distant sounds. Thus, in the strict silence, the clear wooden fish sounds and the sonorous cymbal sounds continue, along with the harmony of praise.</p>
<p>The hall always stands solemn and speechless. All there is is empty silence.</p>

<p>A branch of "Jade Plum" heralds the return of spring, and the scenery of "Xin Garden" is reopened. The "tender green" color of the "Yangliu Green" shines, and the "bright" peach blossoms are like colorful clouds piled up. "Swallows" follow the wind and chase each other, and "butterflies" wear flowers and are not tired. In an instant, the whole garden is "competing for fragrance", and a "cuckoo" urges the spring to end. "Li Lian" blooms, "Qian Ping" flourishes, the moon is "juan juan," the wind is "xu lai," listening to thunder at the "Saizhen Tower," enjoying the cool at the "Ji Pavilion." Remember the "Lanjun Orchid" outside the window, "Ruxiang" fills the room and enters my heart. And again, the moon raises the "Minghui" and the Milky Way is clean, and the painted screen initially displays "Zhiyun" flying. A piece of "light illuminates" thousands of miles of white, how much "autumn heart" should be seen in this. Yellow flowers are thin, "enduring frost" and cold, the "lone goose" sings high into the clouds. Who knows, one night of "autumn wind" and autumn rain, adds several layers of "autumn marks" wet moss. "Hujia" plays, "Yiwei" turns, and the "ancient pine" stands towering in front of the wind. It is difficult to sleep alone on the quilt, and "Mengshi" is frozen and composes "Xuehuai" by the window. I only say that "Xianzhai" is cold and difficult to spend in loneliness, fortunately, the "Naifang" in the pot accompanies the cold years, and the meaning of "Drunkard" is enough to comfort.</p>

<p>The wax goes and spring returns, and all things are new. The sound of firecrackers expresses joy. Every household changes peach charms, and in the sound of gongs and drums, they wish for peace. Everyone, big and small, is happy, and every congratulation brings a smile. Some have a glass of warm wine and family fun, and students and old friends talk together. Some have a Sheng and Xiao string ensemble, and Qing plays the flute and Sheng. Some write red with a pen in the New Year to take auspicious words, and may all things be as you wish. Some play eight rounds of clearing games, and it doesn't matter to relax and talk about winning or losing. Some go on a spring outing in pairs, and are more affectionate. Some have naughty children throwing small firecrackers, and every sound is a surprise. There are more tourists on the road than crickets, and every piece of clothing is dazzling. In fact, the New Year is the same old person, why must every piece of clothing be new. Although it is a custom passed down, it is considered a happy event once a year. If there is no New Year to decorate, on New Year's Eve, the total accountant will not be able to settle the accounts clearly. I wish everyone to start from scratch, and work hard to use the opportunity. The plan of the year lies in spring.</p>

<h3>The Clarion Call of Chinese Children's Drama</h3>
<p>News of the Upcoming Establishment of "Our Children's Drama Society"</p>
<p>The Chinese theater world has always paid little attention to children's drama, but children's drama is indeed an important task in children's education. Therefore, the younger members of various theater troupes in this city feel that general theater troupes cannot provide them with opportunities for research or talent, and they deeply know that children's drama urgently needs to be promoted by children themselves. Therefore, they initiated the organization of "Our Children's Drama Society" in September last year. Preparing until now, they have been working hard with their own finances and strength. They rehearsed plays such as "In the Crossfire" and "Wild Children" in November last year, intending to participate in the founding meeting of the "Children's Friends Association" of the Shanghai Evening News. However, the script was banned by the concession authorities, and the "Bell Sounds of the Ancient Temple" of the "Children's Friends Association" was also banned. Therefore, most of the actors of "Bell Sounds of the Ancient Temple" participated, which greatly increased the strength of the society. And in December, during the Christmas holiday, they were invited by St. Duerte School to perform the play "Wild Children," which was well received. In December, they also initiated the "Shanghai Theater World Aid Sui Joint Performance," which was attended by more than 30 theater troupes in this city. However, due to the situation and the procedures for reviewing the scripts, the Social Affairs Bureau did not approve 26 scripts and ban 10 scripts until the end of January this year. At that time, the society was actively preparing for the founding meeting and the public performance of the three-act children's play "Love's Education." It was not possible to reconvene the theater troupes, so the "Aid Sui Joint Performance" was implemented. Later, due to the problem of the theater, the society decided at its ninth preparatory meeting: to postpone the public performance and convene the founding meeting in advance. The "Aid Sui Joint Performance" was also suspended because most of the scripts approved by the Social Affairs Bureau had been banned by the concessions before, and theaters in Nanshi, Zhabei, and other districts did not approve of theatrical performances. Therefore, the society also decided to suspend the process at the preparatory meeting. It is now heard that the society has more than 30 members and is about to hold a founding meeting, and has issued letters of origin and soliciting sponsors and supporting organizations.</p>
<h3>Recent News of the Forties Drama Society Rehearsing "Sai Jinhua" and "Qiu Jin"</h3>
<p>"Sai Jinhua" and "Qiu Jin" are scheduled to meet with people in the capital at the Capital National Grand Theater on February 17, so all departments have been working extremely hard in recent days.</p>
<p>In the prologue of "Qiu Jin," the Qiu Jin couple had already clashed. The conflict intensified in the first and second acts. Due to the approaching date of the trip to Beijing, rehearsals were added, so Wang Xianzai, who plays Wang Tingjun, and Li Lilian, who plays Qiu Jin, argued several times a day.</p>
<h3>"Paradise Yearning for Earth" at the Great Shanghai Cinema</h3>
<h3>Hua'an Broadcasting</h3>
<p>The film "A Match Made in Heaven," directed by Shen Fu, has now been completely edited and submitted to Beijing for review. It will be released soon. The film was shot at 100,000 feet, with 9,000 feet of highlights selected. There are 85,000 humorous scenes that will make you laugh 300 times during the screening.</p>
<p>In "A Match Made in Heaven," the comedic superstar Han Langen plays a lonely worker, Bai Lu plays a street girl, Liu Jiqun plays a factory owner, and Yin Xiucen plays a worker, all with extremely moving performances.</p>
<p>The song "Carefree Ramblings" in "A Match Made in Heaven" was deemed too frivolous by the Film Review Board, so it was not included, a painful sacrifice and a great pity.</p>
<p>In "A Daughter Among Generals," Li Zhuozhuo is consistently portrayed as a beautiful, charming, patriotic woman who loves the party, while Li Qing plays a steadfast, courageous, and forward-thinking model party member.</p>
<p>The cast of "Daughter of a General" is as follows: Li Zhuozhuo as the general's daughter, Li Qing as a party member, Heng Li as a general, Han Langen as a soldier, Mei Lin as the old servant's daughter, Hong Jingling as the general's henchman, and Liu Jiqun as an old servant, a very appropriate combination.</p>
<p>"Daughter of a General" is a shocking and significant film directed by He Mengfu, and it is also the first collaboration between Li Zhuozhuo and Li Qing.</p>
<p>"A Pearl Lost in the Sea" is Zhu Shilin's new work, with a very compact and tortuous plot, full of dramatic value. What's especially wonderful is that it captivates the audience step by step.</p>
<p>In "A Pearl Lost in the Sea," Li Zhuozhuo transitions from youth to old age, from a progressive new woman to a kind and amiable mother. Throughout this transformation, she always fights against the harsh environment to the end. Zhuozhuo's performance is able to move people with emotion.</p>
