<h3>津英租界郵局由武裝警察守衛</h3>
<p>日備忘錄方式有錯誤　英政府研究應採態度</p>
<p>［天津］日當局曾以備忘錄致領事團、謂擬接管英租界郵務局與無綫電報局與法租界之中國電報局、領事團對於與日當局關於此事之談話、現守緘默、惟聞雙方皆視備忘錄在方式上有錯誤因此發生之誤會、業經消釋、同時各領事連日領事在內、正待其本國政府之訓令、故此事現在停擱中、日當局等屢圖入電報局與電話局未果、英租界之郵務局、現由武裝警察守衛、據非官塲外人各界聲稱、要求以中國機關直接交與日人、實爲空前之舉動、衆意華北政治大局、今尙未定、放不能討論此事（十二日中央電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］日本駐中國天津領事館、日昨通吿領事團云、日本方面卽將接收英租界內中國郵政局及無綫電報局、曁法租界內中國電報局、此項消息傳至此間之後、英國政府現在研究所應採取之態度、官塲人士以爲天津英租界內中國郵政局、原係隸屬天津中國郵政總局、天津郵政總局、現在日本當局手中、設立檢査機關、其事至爲易易、自可不必再在英租界設立檢査郵件之機關云（中央社十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］路透社探息、自日方表示欲接收天津英法租界內中國郵政局後、英政府巳積極考慮天津新局勢、蓋以日人此舉、將使天津英人郵件有被日人檢査之危險也、惟英國對此將採何種態度、現尙未悉、（中央社十二日路透電）</p>

<p>［香港］粵晶領十二日將重要公文運日、必要時下旗歸國、（十二日專電）</p>
<p>［香港］據此問隨人消息、汕頭日領事已論令該處日僑婦孺、今日全數出境、乘日方專輪返國、若干男子則暫留汕頭、惟事急時、亦須集中於日領署、（中央社十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［廈門］汕日台僑全部撤退、日領山岐率館員十二日同乘福建丸離汕、（十二日專電）</p>
<h3>靑日警仍巡邏市內</h3>
<p>［青島］靑市府對日警及義勇隊、擅自巡邏市區事、提出抗議後、頃已接到日領館之答覆、仍藉口保僑、謂無他用意、但不承認有攜帶武器情事、現日警仍於晚間巡邏、我方亦加緊戒備、此間日僑婦孺大部份已撤回本國、惟壯丁均留此、日驅艦楚雪吹雪兩艘、十一日下午一時許開抵靑、現此間共停日艦四艦、（十一日中央社電）</p>
<p>［青島］靑市現泊有日艦計四艘、英美法十一艘、市面冷落、惟人心尙鎭定、又膠濟沿綫各大站私警察、多改着華服服務、靑市及膠濟洽綫日僑、有限十七日返國訊（十一日專電）</p>

<h3>日調大批軍艦到滬倫敦人士頗不安</h3>
<p>日軍佔據天津郵局　英美法將提出抗議</p>
<p>［倫敦］今晨英國各報皆以顯著地位、登載上海突然緊張局勢、並附以一九三二年滬戰之照片、惟因時間匆促、未及於接訊後著論批評、上海之危險、較諸華北之衝突、當然更引起英國民衆對於日本危害眞相之注意、政府方面雖尙未見詳報、但亦不欲忽視時局之嚴重、衆料政府必作種種努力、向中日勸解、以期和緩時局、面避免星火燎原之危險、但英國不致採高壓行動、衆信許多有勢力之日人、對於在華事項之目前趨向、亦爲之惶恐不安、據觀察家意見、日本海軍之在滬示威、或非志在挑釁、但欲使中國神經總樞之上海民衆、述於日本武力之强大、而了解日本欲成就其在華北野心之决心耳、（中央社十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］此間人士對於中日時局現抱悲觀、上海最近之發展愈使人惶慮、惟雙方所可接受之和平解决、尙非絕對無望、據證券市塲經紀人云、今日中日兩債券、比較昨夜、中國跌百分之二、日本跌百分之一、市况如常、交易極少、實則價格之低落、由於購者之缺乏、而非由於賣方之壓力、賣方並未紛紛出售、否則市價當更低也、（中央社十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］上海紅橋事伴發生之後、日本突派軍艦多艘駛抵黃浦江、此項消息傳至倫敦之後、一般人士業已發生深刻印象、並以爲各該軍艦、連巡洋艦在內、吃水不深、可以溯江而上、直趨南京、果爾、則中日兩國衝突將爲之一般化、此在英國軍界人士則以爲、中國若在長江江面敷設水雷、日本軍艦卽無法上駛云、（中央社十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］遠東局勢日趨緊張、此間頗感不安、據稱、英政府與美法政府保持密切聯絡、又稱、日軍佔據天津郵局、英法兩國大約將提出聯合抗議、（十二日國民海通電）</p>
<h3>日本窮兵黷武促進美俄携手</h3>
<p>日軍如侵犯外蒙　蘇聯决有所行動</p>
<p>［莫斯科］日本刻又開始侵略中國北部、其行動或竟使日本勢力範圍擴大、而至外蒙古邊界、亦屬可能、蘇聯外交常局有鑒及此、爰乃利用一切機會、藉向美國人民表示共重視俄美兩國睦誼之忱、美國務卿赫爾前於上月十六日發表宣言、說明所抱和平政策之後、各國外交當局予以答復者、當以蘇外委李維諾夫爲第一人、李氏並曾乘機重申該國前在軍縮會議所提出之建議案、主張設置常設和平會議、藉以響應赫爾、關於日俄兩國關係、某某國人士宣稱、遇有必要時、蘇聯凖備退至鳥拉爾山、以免與日本發生戰事、證諸最近所發生黑龍江事件、與天津蘇聯領事館被刦事件、可見蘇聯對於遠東爭端、不擬輕易捲入漩渦、但若日本進攻外蒙古、西比利亞鐵路勢必感受嚴重威脅、屆時蘇聯自當遵守對於外蒙古所擔負之互助義務而有所行動也、至關於外傳中俄兩國成立秘密恊定一事、此間日本人士均無所聞、並謂關於蘇聯以軍火接濟中國一層、截止目前爲止、亦無事宜足資證明云、（中央社十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］各觀察家頃宣稱、英法兩國對於西班牙問題、尤其是遠東問題所抱熊度、已使蘇聯感覺失望、因而蘇聯外交當局現正竭力謀與美國接近、並設法鼓動美國輿論、促其注意遠東中日糾紛、綠他日能使日本退讓者、唯美國有此力量故也、此外、中國北平市陷落共速、亦使蘇聯各報感覺失望、以爲北平之失、乃由於漢奸與日本間諜活動所致、與西班牙國比爾波城之誤於托洛斯某派間諜者如出一轍、據聞各該問謀當時曾以比爾波城外“鐵衛綫”之圖樣、授予國民軍、乃得一攻而下云、（中央社十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>湖北農村雜寫</h3>
<p>— 成駿</p>
<p>孔壟之“夜行船”</p>
<p>由武穴東行九十里至小池口入黃梅境、此地原屬江西九江縣、隔江管領、行政院爲便利行政、及管理江堤修防特劃歸黃梅、接牧尙不過數月、當時有人建議、將梅屬之孔壟以南地帶、合併小池、成立濱江新縣、因無此必要面罷、小池口踞長江北岸、與九江隔江面時、有商辦渡輪相通、商店約數百家棉花糧食、多由此出口、故棉行求行特多、其附近豐一豐二兩鄕田地、富於生產、惟地勢低產、時虞水淹、全恃江堤爲保障、自此至孔壟、皆屬黃梅下鄕、亦稱水鄕、劃爲八大圩區、人民生命財產之安全、悉爲堤圩是賴、故修防極爲努力、</p>
<p>小池孔壟間、四十里送程、有小港名夾港可通帆船、爲主要交通工具、多於晚間航行、名日夜行船、綠波蕩𣻌之中、往來如織、漁歌互答、餘約悠然、使人神往、此時正值夏間、夜航自樂多於苦、若在寒冬、風雪交加、堅冰觸面、則隨指裂膚、又有苦無樂、此種小船、共三百餘艘、航行一次、無論裝人載物、只須五六角代價、船戶半屬農民、半爲專業、從前當地流氓地痞、組織所謂“碼頭”、强牧“碼頭捐”至十成之六、例如船資五角、船戶終夜辛勤、只得二角、面氓痞反坐牧角、天下不平之事、殆無過此、行之多年、縣府取締不能行效、且生山種種反應作用、</p>
<p>孔壟爲黃梅重要市鎭、街市大半在堤上、因扼交通樞紐、商業尙屬繁榮、商會主席吳尙達、勇於任事、電燈等健設、鈞其力成、縣立第一完小設此、辦理尙佳、由孔壟至縣城五十里、獨輪車（土車）可達、從前爲驛道、舖有石板、行旅甚便、民十七年、縣長李某、另築汽車道、强佔民田爲基、又將舊路石板挖去、一遇天雨、則濘泥沒輕、不但汽車路並未通庫、即舊路亦不堪行走、至今良田被佔之農民、與行路不便之車夫、莫不交口胃之、可見每辨一事、不先爲民案打算、其結果必歸於失敗、惟此路尙屬重要、今亦當設法修成、以利交通、</p>
<p>縣孔道中、經白湖渡、俗傳即古昭開、不可考、惟該縣實居吳頭楚尾、而當日長江故道、確在小池孔壟之間、昭開在此、亦似可信再三十里爲十里舖、洪楊時爲軍事要地、淸特曾國藩·飽超·多隆阿等、及太平天國英王陳玉成、在此大小數百戰、荒塚𢑥𢑥、皆此輩健兒埋骨之所、至今“四眼狗之大名、猶震於民間、現在該縣爲鄂赣皖通衢、一有軍事發生、仍爲必爭之地、</p>
<p>縣城城郭高峻、河流繞之、未匪猖厥時，迭以數師之衆攻城、因隊長馬耀奎、勇敢着戰、民衆恊力齐心、故四鄕赤化、而斗大孤城、始終保全未陷、现在全境尙稱平靖、縣中學設南城外、中心小學設城內、又有敎育館一所設備皆甚完善、</p>
<p>全縣分四區、半爲山鄕、即上鄕、半爲水鄕、即下鄕、上鄕常苦旱、下鄕常苦水、農產上鄕以稻爲大宗、下鄕以棉爲大宗、年豐時、自給之外、尙可運出銷售、人民性善而耐勞、知禮而守法、號稱易洽、惟自十五年後、赤匪騷擾、加以二十年大水、二十三年大旱、農村完全破產、四鄕農民、衣不蔽身、食不飽腹、山居之民、至不知鑒味、往年一遇灾數、尙可結伴出外逃荒、今則亦被制止、在窮困氛圍之中、救死不暇、而催征捐稅之吏、尙不斷臨門、甚至以“非賑不生”之灾民資格、一面領得賑款、一面即須以之納稅、此種矛盾之事、使人哭笑不得、</p>

<h3>國防綫上的石家莊</h3>
<p>— 西民</p>
<p>石家莊在平漢路沒有通車以前、不過是數十家農民聚居的一個塞村，後來平漢通車，正太鐵路亦以此地爲終點，於是人口大增商業也因之繁盛，各種工廠如紡紗玻璃火柴烟草等業均先後創辦，一二十年來的經營，現在已儼然成爲六萬人口的巨鎭。</p>
<p>正太鐵路通車以後，山西省出產的煤和棉花以及其它雜糧皆從此處出口，轉平漢車經天津運銷海內外，故石家莊在政治區城的劃分上，雖是屬於河北省獲鹿縣區之內，而事實上却是山西經濟上政治上以及軍事上唯一的咽喉·記者抵石莊之次日，訪晤石莊中央銀行吳經理，據談：山西煤礦與井陘煤礦，每年經石家莊運出者，價值總在一千萬元以上，而山西每年秋後棉花農產經石家莊輸出者總數在四五千萬元左右，從此對石莊地位之重要更可獲得一個明證了。</p>
<p>敵人在加緊侵略河北進窺山西的過程中，早就注意到石家莊，過去日人高唱的滄石鐵道或津石鐵道是皆以石莊綫終點的，假如日人晤寐不忘的津石綫有一天築成，而敵人的鐵路就很迅速地可以從北寗路從塘沾經天津到石家莊，吏進一步深入一晋！到那時候，橫亙的太行山脈怕也阻止不住敵人的猖狂！</p>
<p>然而敵人的陰謀終於未曾如願以償，蘆溝橋頭的一塲血戰，已驚醒了全中國的大衆！中國是站起來了，不再步步退離！敵人至此大概也十分覺悟威脅欺騙已不能順利的來完成其“巧取”的侵略政策！真的！除非華北化成焦土，中國已决心用血肉來限止敵人侵略觸鬚——津石綫的完成。津石鐵路恐怕要成爲一個歷史上的名詞！</p>
<p>蘆溝橋事件爆發後，石家莊的空氣目然也因之緊張起來；上行的火車是一日的繁忙，機車的氣笛，不斷的發出狂嘯！這一些在飽有战時生活經騐（在北洋政府時代平漢綫時有內戰）的石家莊人民的腦神筋裹是知道得很淸楚的·上月二十七日，平津局勢突然變化，保定成爲河北唯一軍政的中必，日本的飛機接二連三的飛往保定轟炸。石家莊是保定迤南第一重地，所以日本的飛機也是經常光顧，仳飛偵察，不時用機槍往下掃射，本月四日奉命駐防本地的某部曾用高射砲和高射機關槍向敵射擊但未命中。</p>
<p>在石家莊經商的人，大半都是山西籍的客戶，這幾天來，有錢而沒有什麼事情的富商鉅買，聽說已有不少離此近晋，但是這畢竟是少數的少數，記者抵石莊後，閑步街頭，商店依然是像平常一樣的營業，居民也都很鎭定，毫無慌張的狀態。據此地中央銀行吳經理語記者，此地金融方面，只河北省銀行鈔票因爲平津淪陷關係，信用上受點影響，但是經中中交三行竭力維持的結果，市面流通，與其它紙幣並無軒輊，故金融也很安定。</p>
<p>蘆案發生前，本地駐軍就調往前方，此地往來隊伍雖然很多，但皆係過路性質，所以有一個短時期沒有負維持石莊治安專責的部隊，上月二十日以後，始有某部移於此，專負石莊警衛之責·記者甫抵石莊，對駐軍所得印象是精神飽滿，紀律嚴明，心裹感到非常愉快。駐軍長官對石莊防空極爲認眞，除掉不時舉行防空演習外，並派弟兄沿街曉諭居民以防空方法·石莊居民自民國二十年石友三駐防本地叛變時遭受奉軍飛機轟炸後，對空襲的認識，較一般內地居民眞切得多！每家差不多都掘有地洞以防飛機擲彈，因此，石莊的防空，總算較內地要略勝一籌。</p>
<p>近米曆代在石家莊一帶的漢奸，頗爲猖厥·木月四日恰爲記者抵此間第一日，平漢正太兩車站附近，又捕獲漢奸八名，於他們身上搜出手溜彈等破壞物甚多，據記者向當地軍警機關打聽的結果，近米捕獲的漢奸，總數已不下三數百人，惟詳細的內幕，因爲軍法機關竭端保守秘密，故無法知道，但聞日內將要作一次大規模的判决。</p>
<p>因石莊漢奸問題，使我聯想起日昨火車中某君的一段話，某君吿訴記者，上月三十日保定三輛子彈車被炸事件，軍車停在站內旣無明顯目標，又無特殊緣因，日機投彈恰中軍用車上，一般人都以日機投彈的準確爲異，因此有人斷定道是由於漢奸的吿密。這種猜測是眞是假，尙需切實調査，但是今日普通全國的漢奸活動，的確是一個極嚴重的問題。記者由鄭州至石莊，沿途拍照，皆遭軍警盤問，可見當局對洽安維持，以及對各種形跡吋疑者的注意和戒備，是很認眞的，這可以使漢奸稍形歛跡，不過我總覺得制裁漢奸的擾亂後方，最有效的辦法，還是由民衆組織來執行。所以今後的政府應該更注重於開放民衆救國運動和指導民衆救國運動。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>以抗戰答復敵人的陰謀</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>虹橋飛機場事件發生以後。滬上空氣。驟形緊張。這事件。我們在最初就認定是敵人的陰謀。借此挑起事端。作為大舉侵略我長江流域的藉口。所以當我方市府當局以公正合理的態度。表示願從外交途徑謀求解决。而日方則一面作狂烈的煽動。一面又向我市府提出無理之要求。到前昨二日大批日𨊔與軍隊開到。向我方作顯然的軍事威脅。我們對於日帝國主義的野心。更已完全洞悉。現在我們除了以堅决的抗戰。答復敵人的陰謀外。實已無別的辦法。</p>
<p>關於這次日方在上海的挑釁。我們要指出它的陰謀。是有幾種動機。第一。它以為在上海抄襲侵略平津的故智。也可以收得同樣的效果。所以虹橋飛機場事件發生後。它一面同意進行調解。一面就大肆造謠煽動。密調海軍艦隊前來。到昨日為止。日艦二十八艘列布於浦江。陸戰隊也由三千名突增至七八千人。現在它以為軍事角調佈已經完成。就不惜露出猙獰的面目。作公開的武力威脅了。第二。平津陷落以後。日方所决定的戰略。是在津浦·平漢兩綫暫停前進。先以重力向平綏綫發展。它企圖乘我方對察綏比較疏忽之際奪取南口。佔領察省由此進人綏遠。然後再挾其軍事上的優勢回頭來圖謀冀南及晋魯兩省。然而日來敵軍砲隊猛轟南口。我方堅守不懈。而且全國的注意點都已集中到那方面。不容侵略者再逞其野心。因為這樣日本軍閥又决定以聲東擊西。到處騷擾的策略。在上海挑動衝突以牽制我方軍力的北上。不過這策略。當然並非表示日方在上海及長江流域“並無領土野心”（這是日帝國主義的慣用語）。日帝國主義假若覺得這方面可以乘虛而入。它仍會悍然不顧一切。把大批的軍隊盤踞此地。進而作整個的軍事與外交威脅的。</p>
<p>然而在今日的局面下敵人的一切陰謀早已為吾人洞悉無遺。敵人所謂“在華北無領土野心”卽證明他有領土侵略的野心。敵人所謂“不希望上海事件擴大。卽證明他希望事態的擴大。以大砲轟擊南口。派艦隊進迫上海。乃是鐵一樣的證據。無用多加辯說。不過在今日。我國無論上下。也都已從敵人的侵略陰謀中獲得了慘痛的敎訓。我們認定在敵人所到的地方不論南北都是我們的前綫。我們知道對敵人的任何躱避。任何謙讓。任何妥協的幻想。都已不可能。我們祗有以抗戰來答復敵人的陰謀。也祗有以敵人所給與我們的敎訓還給他一個嚴重的教訓。</p>
<p>上海的形勢已站在大碰擊的邊綠上我們不會有絲毫的退却。也不能有絲毫的退却。我們要以全力的抗戰。答復敵人的挑釁陰謀。</p>

<h3>今日交通之急問題</h3>
<p>— 銳靈</p>
<p>時機已經迫切了！我們加緊做非常時期的準備，這是我們民族賭存亡决生死的重要關頭，我們要竭盡我們最後一分力，流盡我們一滴汗和血，犧牲我們最後所有的一切，以爭取民族的人格和生存。</p>
<p>現在先就交通方面，提出最急要的幾點，政府負責當局對於這些，想必或者已經注意到，或者已經準備着，但是，就個人所想到的，再提出來說一說，也許愚者千慮，有足供給參考的地方，這只是一些原則似乎沒有甚麼機密性質，所以公開的發表，希望可以引出更周密的意見。</p>
<p>我們是弱國，我們對外作戰首先就抱了犧牲的决心，汪精衛先生在解釋最後關頭一篇演講中，提出了焦土（抗戰政策），並且給了最透澈，最明白的解釋，雖然這是嚴酷的犧牲，然而卻是對付敵人有效的手段，在敵人占領區域中，只剩下一堆堆瓦礫，敵人失去了經濟榨取的對象，試問即令攻占了若干域池，究竟對他有多大的意義？敵人想把平津在完善的狀熊中拿過去，就是想留着平津作其後方的給養根據地呵！</p>
<p>我們對付敵人，要抱了焦土政策的决心，要實行堅壁淸野的戰法，我們要利用持久戰，銷耗戰！遊擊戰！</p>
<p>因此，在我們力能保守的地方，我們要拚命保護一切，在我們力不能保守的地方，應該儘可能范圍，將重要的東西，遷到後方較安全地帶，到了最後關頭，則應該毅然毀壞一切，不便宜敵人，對於交通工具，尤應該如此：</p>
<p>過去的事實，使我們太痛心了！九一八瀋陽之變，且不談重大的領土，主權和人民的損失民族和國家地位的低落，即就交通說，車輛的損失，也就不知若干！車輛是可以隨時移動的，九一八以後，關外與關內的鐵路交通，並沒有完全斷絕，只要主持交通者（那時東北交通完全由高紀毅主持）稍微注意到，關外的車輛，很多可以調撥到關內，然而結果，就連北寗路本身的車輛，都被偽奉山路截留了大部份！一二八淞滬之戰，京滬鐵路，也受了極重大的損失，雖然事出倉促，不及預防，然而京滬路當局當時如果早有準備，則最低也可以减少損失！</p>
<p>華北之必將為日本進攻的對象，這是早就誰都知道的！然而，北寗路之唐山機車廠，平漢路之長辛店機車廠，都是中國鐵路規模較大的機廠所在地，從沒有聽說有遷移的準備，現在都落到敵人手中女！平津塘沽山海關一帶滿駐敵兵，然而，北寗路正力謀恢復通車了！通車，這是替誰通車，轉誰運兵啊！</p>
<p>過去的事，現在我們且不說，及時注意，我們還可以挽救一部份。</p>
<p>㊀中國鐵路機車廠，比較規模大的，還有膠濟路在青島的機車廠，據聞，其規模與北寗路之唐山廠相伯仲，應及早將重要機件遷移，以免又落敵手，津浦綫的浦口機車廠，京滬綫的戚墅堰機車廠，對於日本在長江的砲艦和空中的飛機，也受有相當威脅，鐵道部本來有在株州設總機廠的計劃，現在時局緊張，訂購機件，恐不易依時運到，不如將各路機廠重要機件，先遷設株州，或江西境內，以後車輛大修，由總機廠負責，小修則仍由各路就近設廠辦理。</p>
<p>㊁鐵路工作人員，尤其機務，工務，車務等各項有技術性員工，應加以嚴密組織，使與軍事同進退，免被敵人强迫或利用，仍在佔領之路綫上行駛車輛，過去之關外各路，偽奉山路，以及現在之北寗，多由原有員司，繼續服務，致予敵人以莫大便利，此其責任，大半應由過去之路政當局負之，蓋一班中下級員工，旣無法同向後方撤退，而留於當地後，或受武力之威脅，或受生活之壓迫，致不能不忍痛仍在原綫服務，豈出心願？少數自敵人勢力下，逃回後方，路政當局又不予以敵當安插，致陷流落者有之，是無異間接促成員工仍留原綫為為敵服務，故此後對於軍事區內各路綫之員工，應急加以軍事化嚴密組織，使進則可以增加軍運之効能，退則作有秩序之撤退，敵人即占領我路綫，一時亦不易恢復通車，最低限度對技術員工，應做到此種地步。</p>
<p>㊂應即刻組織破壞鐵路及修理鐵路之職工隊，採軍事訓練性質，使從事鐵路之破壞與修理，退却前，如估計無法反攻，應將路軌橋樑，以最敏捷方式，澈底破壞，前進時，又應能以最短促時間，修復路軌橋樑。以便利軍事運輸，至於敵人後方交通之破壞，應軍隊中之游擊隊任之，但鐵路人員應教以破壞技術及供給必要工具。此次事變，我們對於北寗路的路軌橋樑，沒有做嚴重的破壞工作，對於北寗路的車輛，沒有能夠向南撤出，對於北寗路的員工，沒有作有計劃的撤退，所以不到幾天，又馬上成了敵人運兵運糧運械的要道，這種覆轍，以後無論如何不應該再蹈的</p>

<h3>日軍艦兵士麕集本埠形勢嚴重</h3>
<p>日間諜混入刺探我有準備　吳淞江灣等處均紛紛遷避　日前哨及便衣隊開槍挑釁</p>
<p>今晨消息據確息、昨晚日軍陣綫並無變動、但在今晨二時後、有少數前哨步隊及便衣隊、在橫浜河以東及靑雲橋開始活動、並在今晨三時餘、曾開三四槍挑釁、但我方沉着鎮靜並不理采、</p>
<p>今晨二時後、本報記者驅車往公共租界與閘北交界各處、作最後巡視、但見凡通華界之各鐵柵門、均已緊閉、每處均有武裝萬國商團團員警衛把守、遙視閘北方面馬路電炬、雖仍如昔日光明、但馬路上𨵙無一人、狀至凄凉、蓋無形中已入於戰時狀態矣、</p>
<p>滬市情形、昨日間十分緊張、因此一般吳淞閘北以及江灣等一帶居民、紛携箱籠、爭向租界區域搬遷、汽車人力車以及搬塲汽車、被僱一空、而尤以人力車爲最、車夫更高抬車價、乘機牟利、雖近在咫尺、竟有索價高至半元以上者、直至晚間、搬塲之風仍未稍殺、同時租界方面、為維持秩序起見、特派大批武裝中西探捕、分往華租交界等處怖崗、故未見發生紛擾、</p>
<p>至晚間十時左右、因日方軍隊、紛紛出動、並有多數日軍間諜混入我交通要道以及公衆塲所刺探消息、因此我方為自衛計、乃亦作相當之準備、同時公共租界與華界接壤處、恐或有意外或宵小乘機擾亂、乃宣佈於當晚上時起、將華租交界處各鐵門、一齊關閉、記者於下午九時五十分、前往蘇州河北查視、則見開封路·七浦路·甘肅路·海寗路·北浙江路·愛而近路克能海路界路·北山西路界路·北河南路界路·靶子路·北四川路等處各鐵門確已實行關閉、同時萬國商團西人隊、亦已奉令出防、該管匯司虹口捕房、亦加派中西武裝探捕、在各處協助維持秩序、公共租界第五·六·七路有軌電車、於九時四十五分後、即一律進廠、僅往來於北四川路靶子路靜安寺間及外洋涇橋靜安寺間之第一·二兩路電車、仍繼續維持、此外無軌電車方面、僅往來岳州路斜橋間之第十八路車、未曾停止、惟車輛已行减少、因此乘客十分擁擠、各商店英法兩租界中心地段、仍行維持、其他鄰近華租接壤處之各商店、則均提早收市、甚有竟日未曾開市者、</p>
<p>昨據新聲社記者英美法等國、均已準備增兵來滬、法陸軍由安南調來、昨夜已有四百名乘輪抵滬、尚有四百名、定於下週趕到、英陸軍美海軍陸戰隊、即將分別由香港菲律濱出發、公共租界萬國商團、及法租界之白俄商團、業已於昨夜出動、佈防兩租界邊境各要道口、兩租界巡捕房幹捕、全體出動、共維治安云、</p>

<h3>停戰恊定共同委員會昨開會</h3>
<p>應日方之請竟要求我方撤兵　兪市長嚴正駁斥會議無結果</p>
<p>淞滬停戰恊定共同委員會、昨日下午三時、應日本方面之請求、在工部局會議廳召集會議、參加者除我國代表上海市長兪鴻鈞、日方代表駐滬總領事岡本外、尚有英法美義四國代表、</p>
<p>岡本氏首先致詞席間、首由日方代表岡本氏致詞、稱中國代表、於昨日吿知本人、謂距離日僑居住區域附近之保安隊、業已後退、但今晨保安隊及正規軍隊、已在近郊設置防禦工事此種行動、違反停戰協定、應請共同委員會加以注意、採取有效辦法、加以制止云云、</p>
<p>兪市長嚴正駁斥岡本致詞畢、兪市長即以嚴正之態度與言詞、加以駁斥云、余聞日方代表之言詞後、深覺日方代表、以爲共同委員會、乃專為滿足日方要求而設置者、此種心理、實絕錯誤、共同委員會設置之目的、在維持上海之和平與治安、並非恊助日本政府實施侵略政策、日方代表、乃以各中立國之代表為其工具、需要時利用之、不需時棄置之、不亦大謬、余作此語、蓋有所根據、去歲日本軍隊會侵入八字橋一帶地點、按照停戰恊定之規定、日軍應在該處撤退、是以停戰恊定、早已為日軍之背信行為、破壞無餘矣、須知停戰協定須雙方遵守、始為有效、如僅一方遵守、决無補於實際、現在停戰恊定、旣早為日方之違反行動、扯毀無餘、是以中國代表、認為日方根本無根據協定再作任何提議之權、此應請注意者一、其次、虹橋不幸事件發生後、日方曾一再表示靜候調查事實眞相、以外交方式解决但一方竟軍艦雲集、軍隊大增軍用品亦大量補充、此外尚有大批軍艦正在途中源源而來、此種措施、不獨妨害上海各國僑民之安全、且對中國為一種威脅、且足發生危害之行為中國在本國領土內、當然有權採取自衛之行動、本人昨日確曾吿知日方代表、我國保安隊已從目僑居住附近區域稍稍後退、此乃係以市長之資格通吿者、當時本人並曾對日本軍艦軍隊雲集上海一點、向日方代表提出抗議、日方代表當時對日軍增加一節、答稱不知、惟相隔不久、本人即徵實日本軍艦軍隊、確已大量增加、是則為防衛計、保安隊當然無可撤退矣、總之、我方秉承中央所定人不犯我我不犯人之一貫政策、對僑居上海之各國僑民、仍當加以保護、對各國僑民之利益、亦仍當照常尊重、請各代表轉知僑民𥼶念可也、</p>
<p>會議無結果而散至此、各國代表提議、可否將保安隊稍稍後退以免發生衝突、兪市長當即答稱、停戰協定早經日方破壞、故本日實無召集共同委員會之必要、但各國代表係以領事資格、出任調解、本人亦極願商談惟我國軍隊、在本國土地、行動有絕對自由之權、此則未容他人置喙、茲爲維持上海之和平與治安計、如日本將增加之軍艦與軍隊調回、則我方對撤退保安隊二點、亦願加以考慮云、日本代表對於此點、無具體答稱於是會議毫無結果、惟雙方代表均表示决竭力設法避免開釁、至五時一刻散會、</p>

<h3>戰時狀態下閘北巡禮</h3>
<p>日寇自陷平津以來、其駐滬海軍、亦復躍躍欲試、每日登岸遊行示威、滬北商民、原屬驚弓之鳥、深恐一二八慘劇、再度演出、故稍稱殷實者、均預先遷徙、以避兇燄、迨至前週形勢似略緩和、當局且有治安無慮之表示遷移之風於以稍戢、不料日前突又發生虹橋機塲事件、日方竟結集兵艦二十八艘於滬海、一面向我市府提出無理耍求、冀達其威脅我方屈服之目的、致時局頓趨嚴重、整個閘北、已全部入於戰時狀態、該區域內曁昆鄰地帶居民、莫不紛紛遷避、自早至暮、未嘗休止店舖、臨時停業者、比比皆是、虹口匯司狄思威路等捕房、則將與華界接壤處之警備一律增厚、以維公共租界安寗、分述各情如次、</p>
<p>遷徙</p>
<p>昨日昧爽起、凡住居閘北區域及與閘北昆鄰各處之人、即紛粉向蘇州河以南遷避、由北往南之馬路、幾盡爲搬塲之卡東·汽車·塌車·老虎車·黃包車·佔有、尤以北浙江路·福建路·北河南路·北西藏路·最爲擁擠其中貧苦小戶、無資僱車者、則自行或挑或扛、左提右携、途爲之塞、更有抱負嬰孩、倉遽奔逃者、顚沛流離之慘狀、較一二八時尤甚、最擁擠之時間、莫過於午前十一時與午後四時、此兩次均自老垃圾橋迤北至界路途中、悉屬各項小車啣接、毫無挿足餘地、至夜七時、猶未見稀少、故北區經昨日之澈底移動、剩餘人口、確屬寥寥無幾矣、</p>
<p>停市</p>
<p>昨日午前、北區尚祇遷移、別無舉動、迨午間鄰近該車站之商店相率自動停市、俄而蔓延及於北浙江路·愛爾近路·海寗路·北山西路·北河南路·老靶子路·北四川路·等處、及至午後、各該路之店舖收市者、乃與時俱增、比晡以上、各處竟有完全停業而無一家開門者矣</p>
<p>警備</p>

<p>交通</p>
<p>滬北方面、昨日紛擾竟日、各馬路行人如梭、而秩序則無紊亂、固屬探捕維持盡力、亦幸電車未遭阻碍、但自晚間七時後、六路圓路電車往北、祇至北浙江路第一特院止、即須掉頭、所有北站及沈家鴻一段、則暫停行駛、五七兩路電車七時以後、亦改在北浙江路法院門前掉頭、故夜間各處與北站之交通、已完全斷絕、凡欲往北站方面者、大感不便矣、</p>

<h3>還不立定脚跟！</h3>
<p>— 珊</p>
<p>上海的空氣因大隊日艦來滬而突然緊張了。扶老携小的逃難者在前幾日本來有一點平定下去，虹橋飛機塲事件發生的當晚，雖也有過一度的紛擾，但第二日因有循外交途徑解决的决定，所以那一次是成為虛驚，而現在，則由於大隊日艦的抵滬，日方的態度又突然倔强起來，於是在一二八嘗過苦頭的上海居民，又紛紛的倉皇狼狽遷出了他們規模初具的老家。</p>
<p>對於搬家，我是不反對的，尤其是虹口一帶目下處於日人的武力範圍內的居氏，他們的搬家更可原諒，因為卽使要想做一點救亡工作，常也得“留得靑山在”才“不怕沒柴燒”，根據“一二八”，根據天津的經騐，我們可以想到，要是不幸上海發生戰事，則逗留在日人武力之下者，我們同胞將會遭遇到怎樣的待遇！</p>
<p>然而搬家以後，我們將做些什麼呢？在家裏牛衣對泣嗎？而從閘北虹口一帶搬到了租界，是否是已到了“安全地帶”了呢？</p>
<p>也姑且承認公共租界的中區和法租界是“安全地帶”吧，可是這安全兩字是應當怎樣的加以解釋呢？上海的第二個一二八如果不發生，那自然，閘北和租界一樣“安全”若是發生了呢，閘北也許又將充一下戰塲，可是在戰塲上，每個人不一定就會死亡，我們勝了，那地帶就比租界更安全，若是不幸的話，那麼，租界也不一定是安樂土。不耍說日方將會加給我們同胞以怎樣的羞辱和殺戮，就退而言之說租界還是“安全地帶”吧，那麼請問：你凖備好了幾月的食宿之糧？沒有穿沒有喫，能雊在所謂“安令地帶”獃下去？</p>
<p>橫在我們前面的路祇有一條：為了活命，我們就該死裏求生的拚出去！狗急尚且跳牆，我們給人趕到東趕到西的趕着，難道就被逼而乖乖地死在敵人之前不成？前有大江，後有追兵，我們現在眞的已到了這樣的地步了，不是回轉身去和敵人拼一下，就得往大江裏撲通跳，而你，難道就眞的這樣無用的甘願往大江裏跳嗎？</p>
<p>我們已無路可退了！如要活，就得回轉身來，立定脚跟，和我們的敵人來幹一下。不然，你也是不會有命的。</p>
<p>大家已經從閘北一帶搬出來了，是的，那是為了避免無謂的犧牲，可是，搬出來以後，凖傭怎樣呢？</p>
<p>時局已到了這樣局面了，還不立定脚跟，還不背轉身來凖備和敵人幹一下，你想逃到那裏去呢？</p>
<p>我們已無路可逃了，還不立定脚跟！報吿文學工塲街芷夫</p>
<p>報告文學</p>
<h3>工場街</h3>
<p>— 芷夫</p>
<p>我們經了三四天的奔波，經了七八個地帶的宣傳，從開始一直到現在。我們更為要彌補幾天來一切的缺點；四個熱情的靑年人仍把握往鐵一般的主意，在第五天淸晨將要出發的時候，又臨時開了一個簡單的座談會</p>
<p>我們要在半個小時內立刻决定今天的去處：——朝東：或是向西。</p>
<p>但是在席位上，我們每個人却又蹙緊着眉頭躊躇起來了，沉默着，這樣經過了五分鐘模樣的耽延，最後，那個性情頑固而倔强的我們的伙伴——石泯，他忽而站起來高聲地說：</p>
<p>“我們現在應該走到工人的區域裏去。——盡我們的力量要把勞働者每一顆心聯繫起來，成為一條堅硬的鐵練才是！”</p>
<p>不錯的。在後方的廣大羣中工人原是估了最重要的一部份，當然不能使我們拋忘呵！因此，他的提案卽刻便獲了我們的同意。尤其我，為了擁護他的主張，禁不住舉起了找的一條右臂：</p>
<p>“——凖採取這個辦法吧！”</p>
<p>——然而，我們就上那一塊地段去呢？………這解不開的疑問的符號，句盤據在我的心窩中忐忑着。幸而我們中另一个伙伴相當熟悉西區的情形：於是，最後决定下來的今天目的地：是××路一個工塲街（註），於是我們八條的腿子都興奮地開始交替着朝前行進了。</p>
<p>一路上，朝陽像一塊巨大的明鏡似的，從雲堆裏探出金黃的光輝來，照示着我們更滿懷着和太陽同樣的熱情，加緊着步伐，走着未盡的前面的路。</p>
<p>然而我們每張臉却是嚴肅的！……</p>
<p>到達工塲街的時候，已是十點一刻模樣了。我們就在近處揀定了一個寬大的廊房。接着，隊中有人純熟地把手裏一捲加註了“保定被日機轟炸”七個紅字標題的當天的報紙，凑在嘴角上當作號筒：我們宏饗的聲音立刻向四處傳播開去了：——</p>
<p>“諸位兄弟！諸位工友，姊妹們！………”</p>
<p>——啊！啊………</p>
<p>剛在我們喊出了第一聲的時候，遠近的每個工房裏，却發出了一陣啊，啊……的聲音！這聲音，簡直是興奮的號呼，挺奴隸的吶喊。隨卽，那一羣羣男女的靑年工人便像潮水一般地湧濯着，圍住了我們的周身。——他們也許是從夢中驚醒來；我曾瞧見他們有的亂披着頭髮；或是還在扭着不完整的衣扣。…</p>
<p>騷音沉息下來了，許多的人頭也顯得比前整齊了。然而人羣中，却有一個紙白臉兒的伙子闖進來，他抬起二爿無血色的唇皮對我們抖動了一會，終於戰戰地向着我們道：</p>
<p>“這…這裏是講不得的，先生！……我們的××管事刚才出去……怕卽…卽刻就要回來的，要是……要是給他碰見，事情就……就不是鬧玩的啊！………”</p>
<p>他說着說着，一邊用起尖銳的眼光不住向四下里探望。但是當他正驚慌失措的時候，另一些男女工人們却立刻向他報答了一張張獰恶的笑臉。——</p>
<p>“誰怕這個××　老？……你是個漢奸，你替我們滾開！”</p>
<p>“猪玀！走遠些，拍××人馬屁去吧！”</p>
<p>“走——滾，——”</p>
<p>大家把那個忠實的奴隸驅走之後，這邊有一位二十來歲的小婦人却迎上前來似乎懇求我們道：</p>
<p>“先生！你們講吧！——關於華北的事……××人現在是怎的………？”</p>
<p>她那副誠意的臉態，正彷彿剛學走路的小孩子向大人家要糖吃似的樣子；於是，我們便有人急於的講下去了：</p>
<p>“……諸位！華北是我們中國的天堂，可是現在被敵人的槍砲轟擊着。北平和天津二個地方已經淪陷了。——他們在那裏到處虐待我們的人民，威逼我們的華工帮助×乓軍事的防築，……他們動手便打，便殺，不知已有多少人的性命被他們傷害了！……諸位！人心是一樣的，敵人這樣地兇狠，難道能呌我們忍受嗎？——我們現在耍起來報復，我們要……”</p>
<h3>一脚踢出去</h3>
<p>— 江敉作</p>
<p>“我們要把敵人打向原處去！”</p>
<p>“不怕他們的飛機和大砲…………”</p>
<p>“…………………”</p>
<p>突然的，斜刺里掀起了一陣嘈什的，有力的聲浪，把整個工塲街申沉悶的空氣完全打破了！所有的，是那羣××廠的工人的手臂和拳頭，在飛揚的灰紗層里揮舞着。…………</p>
<p>前後我們講了足有一个多時辰，把目前工人們應負的往務，和所须要的團結精神已澈底地說明了。最後，我們重又移向另一個工塲街去繼續着我們未完成的工作。</p>
<p>然而那個臉子蒼白的傢伙，這時却連影蹤也沒有看見：火概他已明白：——自己也是個中國人啊！</p>
<p>（註）工塲街工人寄宿的大塲舍，攏統地就稱作為“工塲街”。</p>
<p>讀者呼聲</p>
<h3>所望於救國領袖者</h3>
<p>— 呼聲</p>
<p>自從蘆溝橋事件發生以來，上海一埠的救亡運動，可謂達到了空前的高潮。我們每天接讀本埠新聞，沒有一家報紙，不以最大的篇幅來登載關於救亡運動的消息。這自然値得人歡喜與興奮的。但對於目前的救亡運動的方法和工作，筆者猶有些意見，願供本埠𤍠心救亡人士的參考。</p>
<p>第一，今日的救亡運動，顯然是太上層化了。我們不說別的，祇看各種組織的理事名單，這一組織里是這幾個人，那一組織里也還是這幾個人。彷彿所謂救亡工作，都是這幾個人玩的把戲，這是非常不好的現𧰼。自熊這現𧰼要說是幾個人玩的把戲，那是十分錯誤的估計。我們的估計：是的確民衆有非常高的，而且非𤍠切的救亡的要求，但在一被組織起來的民衆間一時還不能產生獨當一面的人，於是便不得不以社會上素負盛名，力量較為充實的人來担任領導工作。可是另一方面呢，什麼組織里都是這幾個人當理事，便是什麼組織的工作做不起來。弄得什麼組織都成了空頭的組織。這是極其危險的，因為，長此下去，組織便不消滅而自消滅了。</p>
<p>第二，今日的各種救亡協會或抗敵後援會裏的分子或單位，太富有了“行會”的性質。參加救亡工作的，僅限於各公會法團的主持人或負責者，各法團裏的分子和會員，沒有直接活動的機會。這辦法，使眞正的民意，還是無法上達。各公會法團，祇在執行上級的命令時，增加會員的負担，使會員對於救亡工作，感不到活躍的興趣，自動地做自己願意做的工作。那在客觀上，恐怕反而使民氣消沉起來。</p>
<p>第三，正和以上二種情形相反，下層的民衆的組織，太不注意。有人主張透過上層來影響下層，那也不錯：所以我並不說上層的工作，並不是要不得的，但上層的工作，沒有下層的基礎，那不但工作不會持久穩固，而且工作容易犯到錯誤。比如，卽就上海本埠而言，在這救亡運動中，對於在敵人工廠裏作工的工人，我們有過什麼安排和籌劃。中國的歷史，實在最富於寶貴的敎訓的。五卅時南京路上殺了我們幾位愛國同胞，馬上來了幾個全國大罷工，尤其是省港罷工，那組織的嚴密，和鬥爭的持久，使香港頓成為衰落的商港。現在敵人殺死了我們成萬的同胞，奪去了我們幾省的土地，甚至於平津也失陷了，為什麼我們不接受這歷史的寶貴的敎訓，擴大我們的經濟戰呢？省港罷工的工人，都編為糾察隊，為什麼我們現在不需要這些工人來武裝保衛我們祖國呢？</p>
<p>自然，以上數點，不過一時想及，希望𤍠心救亡工作者注意。如其以為對的，不妨作個參考！如其以為不對，那麼也算是四萬萬人中一個人有那麼一點意思。總之一句，我們在救亡運動中必須澈底民主化。</p>

<p>附近的農民都圍聚來了。有一個憂心地問：“那不又要打仗了嗎？</p>
<p>“那也沒有法子。不是咱們要打，是鬼子逼着咱們幹。”這是王先生的話</p>
<p>劉得標又拍着斷了的大腿說：“幹就幹，怕什麼？先把鬼子打他媽一個落花流水再說。”</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army's Night Attack on Nankou Failed</h3>
<p>Intense Artillery Battles on Both Sides, Enemy Soldiers Driven Back; Conflict in the Jinghai Area, Enemy Retreats to Yangliuqing; Duliu Town and Liangwangzhuang Both Recovered by Our Army</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] On the morning of the 12th, the Japanese army continued its offensive on Nankou, using twenty-six tanks and field guns as cover, launching a two-pronged attack on Baoyuan. Our army's unit fought bravely to repel the enemy, who failed. Later, reinforcements arrived on both sides, intensifying the battle, with booming artillery fire. After two hours, the enemy could no longer withstand and retreated. It is said that our defensive position has an extraordinary advantage, so even under dense artillery fire, it could not be shaken. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Baoding] On the morning of the 11th, the enemy launched a full-scale attack on Nankou, with a large number of tanks leading the charge. Our infantry, cavalry, and artillery, under the cover of the air force, moved out simultaneously and repelled the enemy, intercepting and burning seventy enemy tank wheels. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Jinan] The Tianjin-Pukou Railway is reopened. Duliu and Liangwangzhuang were recovered by our army today and are now approaching Yangliuqing. Yesterday evening at 6 o'clock, the fighting in Jinghai was fierce, and the telephone line was temporarily cut off but has now been restored. The Duliu and Liangwangzhuang telephone lines are currently under repair. The enemy has approximately 700 infantry, cavalry, and artillery troops. Also, a Japanese aircraft scouted Dezhou at 9 a.m. this morning. (12th Urgent Telegram)</p>
<p>[Jinan] Conflicts have occurred daily between Jinghai and Duliu. On the morning of the 11th, enemy armored vehicles fired twelve shots north of the city, seven li away, and aircraft dropped two bombs. Enemy plainclothes troops provoked at the station's water tower. Our [blank] brigade's [blank] regiment's [blank] battalion responded fiercely. The enemy forces included over 600 Korean and puppet Manchukuo soldiers. The enemy suffered over seventy casualties, while we had two. This morning, our [blank] battalion outflanked the enemy's rear to Liangwangzhuang, completely encircling them and cutting off their retreat. At dawn, enemy aircraft came to provide cover for their retreat, leading to intense fighting. The enemy used armored vehicles to cover their retreat to Yangliuqing, and enemy aircraft also dropped bombs for cover. Our troops took cover in the green crops. The fighting ceased at 3:30 p.m. Our army occupied Duliu Town, while the enemy remained at the station. Enemy and our forces are facing each other in the area near Luoguocun and Putaocun near Liangwangzhuang. In this battle, the enemy suffered over eighty casualties, while we suffered only over twenty. Enemy armored vehicles patrolled between Liangwangzhuang and Duliu. Our army captured a large number of weapons and ammunition. A unit of [blank] cavalry has arrived in Yangliuqing, but the Japanese army in Yangliuqing has not fully retreated. (12th Urgent Telegram)</p>
<p>[Baoding] The Japanese army, which invaded the northern border of Jinghai County along our Tianjin-Pukou Railway on the 11th, was severely attacked by our army and fled in panic by train. Due to the hasty departure, the locomotive fell into the nearby river, and some Japanese soldiers on board drowned. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue. On the morning of the 12th, the Japanese army retreated to Duliu Town Station and was about to board the train stationed there when our vanguard arrived and retook the station. The Japanese army retreated after resisting. Our army has now advanced to Jiawangzhuang. (12th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Baoding] After a heavy bombing of Nankou by the Japanese army, our position is fortified, and it seems they are awaiting reinforcements. Therefore, a serious confrontation is currently underway. (12th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Baoding] Our vanguard on the Pinghan Railway seized a 24-cm Krupp gun and two tanks from the Japanese army near Liangxiang a few days ago. The gun was transported to Baoding on the 12th. (12th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Baoding] Tanggu, Xianshuigu, and Xiaozhan are now garrisoned by the Japanese army with forty to fifty tanks. (12th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Baoding] From 9 a.m. on the morning of the 11th, the Japanese army, with 3,000 infantry, 600-700 cavalry, and over ten artillery pieces, launched a fierce attack on Deshenggou and Nankou under the heavy bombing of nine aircraft. Our army's morale was high, and we responded calmly. The Japanese army at Deshenggou has now been repelled, and Nankou is still in a stalemate. In this battle, we only suffered over ten casualties among our soldiers. (12th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Baoding] The battle situation in the northern suburbs of Jinghai County was extremely fierce on both the 11th and 12th. Duliu Town has now been recovered by our army and is advancing towards Liangwangzhuang. In this battle, the enemy launched a heavy bombing with a large force and a large number of aircraft, so many artillery shells landed on our Jinghai County government and nearby civilian houses, but our army's position was not affected. (12th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Baoding] Japanese aircraft flew over Baoding three times on the morning of the 12th until noon. The first time, two aircraft flew from Baxian at 6 a.m. and circled at high altitude for a long time for reconnaissance. The second and third times were each a single aircraft, each circling for about an hour. (12th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Guihua] The PingSui Railway and eastern Sui are currently still calm. Rumors of bandits being found in the area of Chaigoubao are inaccurate. Although bandit activities are occurring in northern Chahar, they are not as severe as rumored. The national army's strength and deployment along the border of Sui are extremely strong, and the future is promising and will not be exploited by bandits. Residents of Sui City are currently very calm, and everything is as usual. (12th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] The Japanese army is now employing a large number of Chinese traitors to lurk near important locations and railways, seizing opportunities to disrupt public order and damage transportation. On the night of the 8th, two plainclothes individuals were watching the railway bridge a short distance from Chaigoubao on the PingSui Railway. After being questioned by the defense army, one of them shot and wounded one of our soldiers. They were immediately surrounded and captured and are currently under strict interrogation. (9th Special Dispatch, delayed arrival).</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] On the 9th, the puppet army between Shangdu and Honggertu had already come into contact with our forces. On the 8th, a regiment of puppet troops arrived in Zhangbei from Rehe, causing extreme panic among the residents, and shops closed their doors. (9th Special Dispatch, delayed arrival)</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] From the morning of the 10th until 5 p.m., Japanese aircraft passed through Zhangyuan, traveling back and forth between Zhangbei and Nankou, a total of five times. Each time it was a single aircraft, flying high and not dropping bombs. According to intelligence reports, the Japanese side has established a special agency inside the Catholic Church in Nanhancun and set up a radio station. Nakano is the special director. A large Japanese artillery unit, attached with four field guns, seventeen tanks, and fifteen aircraft, has arrived in Duolun. There are also over eighty armored vehicles and over four hundred camels transporting military supplies, actively preparing to attack Chahar and Sui. (10th Special Dispatch, delayed arrival)</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] The people's army led by Bu Ziqian, with over a hundred men, recovered Taosaiba Village, belonging to Chongli County, on the night of the 10th. The puppet chief Ma Ziqian was captured, and fifty-odd rifles were seized. A Japanese instructor was executed. Ma Lianying is now leading the people's army, departing from Baihechuan, to meet up with Bu and others. (11th Special Dispatch, delayed arrival)</p>
<p>[Guihua] On the afternoon of the 10th at 4 p.m., an enemy aircraft arrived in the high altitude of Datong and on the border of Sui for reconnaissance. (11th Special Dispatch, delayed arrival)</p>
<p>[Guihua] The railway is reopened. Our army's vanguard won a victory and arrived at Shahe on the 10th. Zhu Xizhang, the director of the 35th Army's office in Taiyuan, flew to Sui on the morning of the 9th and returned to Taiyuan at 10 a.m. The eastern Sui front line is tense, and tickets for the PingSui train on the 10th were sold only to Xuanhua. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Talks About Resisting Violence and Exercising Self-Defense</h3>
<p>Japanese Rhetoric Contradicts Actions in Fact; All Future Responsibility Should Be Borne by the Japanese Side</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry stated that since the Lugouqiao Incident, the Japanese side has repeatedly claimed verbally that it does not want to escalate the situation, but its actions in fact contradict this. Taking North China as an example, the Japanese side initially claimed to resolve the issue peacefully on the spot, then sent large reinforcements to attack Beiping and Tianjin, committing massacres and arson without restraint. Now, it has further advanced, on one hand, fiercely attacking Nankou, and on the other hand, coveting the southern part of Hebei Province, without end. In Shanghai, the Japanese side verbally agreed to our proposal to resolve the Hongqiao Airport incident peacefully through diplomatic channels, but the Japanese government dispatched a large number of aircraft, warships, marines, and other armed forces to Shanghai, threatening us at will, and at the same time, made various demands, attempting to remove or weaken our self-defense forces. Japanese aircraft have also been illegally flying over Shanghai, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other places for days, preparing for military action. All these actions are violations of our country's territorial sovereignty and violations of various international treaties. In this situation, our country cannot tolerate it. In addition to resisting violence and exercising self-defense, there is no other way. All responsibility for the future development of the situation should be borne entirely by the Japanese side.

<h3>Chen Lifu Gives a Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>Titled "War and Peace"</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chen Lifu, a member of the Central Standing Committee, gave a broadcast speech on the Central Radio Station at 8 p.m. on the 11th entitled "War and Peace." A summary of its essentials is recorded below. Peace has reached a critical juncture, and war is becoming an unavoidable fact. The fate of East Asia is unpredictable, and world peace cannot be guaranteed. At this critical moment of survival, we deeply feel that the hope of reversing the situation is almost gone, but we still want to discuss the true meaning of the word "peace" on the eve of the war, because we want the people of the country to understand that the purpose of war is still for peace, and the path to achieve peace is unavoidable with war. Once the understanding is clear, the desire for peace and the determination to fight can reinforce each other, the psychological contradictions can be resolved, the contribution of capabilities can be strengthened, and there will be ample time to respond to changes. Now, let's try to speak of the true meaning of the word "peace" in Eastern culture, and say that those who are similar supplement each other with abundance to make up for deficiencies, so that there is no difference between each other in the horizontal aspect (no infighting). The so-called "peace" is to supplement each other with abundance to make up for deficiencies, so that there is no difference in height in the vertical aspect (no class). When vertical and horizontal differences are reduced, the two become more similar, grow together without harming each other, and move forward together towards the progress of evolution without stopping. This is the true meaning of peace. Therefore, in terms of the universe, peace is actually the accumulation and arrangement of matter and force, harmony in motion, and equilibrium in stillness, so that each unit's movement and stillness conform to nature, and each obtains its proper place. Therefore, it is said that "the attainment of harmony brings forth the nourishment of heaven and earth." For example, when high-voltage electricity is connected to low-voltage electricity, the high and low harmonize, the flow stops on a plane. When two liquids with different temperatures are mixed, the higher temperature gradually decreases and the lower temperature gradually increases until the two are mixed to the same temperature. As for the kinetic energy of other universes, they all harmonize and equalize each other, and even matter is constantly combined and enters the final state of harmony and stability. Therefore, peace is the law of nature. In terms of humanity, peace is full of the spirit of service and mutual assistance, so that the strong support the weak, the wise benefit the foolish, the many help the few, and self-improvement continues without interruption, all moving forward together on the path of progress, to reach a state where people are basically the same in vertical and horizontal aspects, which is what we call the world of great harmony. Therefore, only when countries can base themselves on the active spirit of "harmony" and "peace" can they advance the world towards great harmony, and only when Chinese people can base themselves on the active spirit of "harmony" and "peace" and "struggle" can they "save China" from peril. Therefore, it is said that "the unity of harmony nourishes all things," and "peace is the way of heaven, and those who harmonize with it are the way of man. The unity of the way of heaven and the way of man is the way of the king. The explanation says "The interconnection of Heaven, Earth, and Man is called Kingship." Peace is full of positive spirit, and it should be so in ordinary times, and even more so in extraordinary times. Since the Wanbaoshan Incident until now, the Japanese people's brutal behavior in our country has only increased the disharmony in the spirits of the two countries and made the inequality in facts more evident. When there is disharmony, there is resistance; when there is inequality, there is outcry; this is the law of nature. Today, if one does not address the issues of harmony and equality and wants to forcibly stop people's resistance and outcry, it is to abandon the root and pursue the branches. If one wants to talk about improving Sino-Japanese relations in this way, it is no different from climbing a tree to catch a fish. The true meaning of peace has been lost, the ties of coexistence have been lost, the signs of disharmony and inequality are increasing day by day, and the idea of selfishness and self-interest cannot be contained, leading to actions that benefit oneself at the expense of others, and contempt for justice, only strength is valued. As a result, how can one not lack propriety, righteousness, and be shameless? Within the country, the discipline is utterly destroyed, and in the international arena, trust and integrity are completely lost. Patriotic people dare to be angry but dare not speak out, and young soldiers act recklessly without restraint. When the four cardinal principles are not upheld, the foundation of the country is lost. The inherent spiritual civilization of the East, with its loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, honesty, righteousness, peace, and the true meaning of the way of the king, vanishes without a trace, willingly becoming "hounds of the hegemonic way, and not city walls of the kingly way." Still, it is pretentious to talk about inheriting Eastern culture and practicing the way of the king. I will weep for Eastern culture and the way of the king. It is no wonder that Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Prime Minister, often sighed deeply when he mentioned the Asian issue to Japan. Considering that under this kind of situation, those with the power to make harmony and peace a reality are precisely those who fear day and night that the emotion of disharmony will decrease and that the degree of inequality will not increase, and that aggression and oppression are increasing, then can peace still be achieved by chance? In order to prevent the degree of disharmony and inequality from increasing further, we cannot but quickly and effectively sanction the facts of aggression and oppression. Responding to the war is an unavoidable request, and there is no other way to seek peace. Since they have abandoned the responsibility of serving as a bastion of the kingly way, we cannot shirk our duty. For the sake of acting on behalf of Heaven (the kingly way), for the sake of world peace, for the sake of the fate of Asia, for the sake of the continuation of Eastern culture, and for the sake of national survival, what other paths can we follow besides sacrificing ourselves for righteousness? We deeply hope that the people of the country will be of one mind and one heart, and under the leadership of the leaders, march forward in an orderly manner, work together to overcome difficulties, and strive for justice and peace. Why should we care about success or failure? The light of Asia's future can only be found in the midst of artillery fire. Today, we can only find it in this. It is fate. It is revolution. Why hesitate? (12th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Decides on School Opening Dates</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Education, in view of the current situation, believes that instructions should be given regarding the opening of schools this semester. It has been decided that schools in Beijing and Shanghai may postpone their opening until September 20th. Schools in major cities along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces may also postpone their opening until September 20th. The specific cities have been designated by the provincial education departments. Schools in the Baoding area of Hebei and Qingdao may also postpone their opening until September 20th if necessary. The Ministry will issue separate instructions for schools in Beijing and Tianjin. Schools in other general areas should still open on the originally scheduled dates. On the 12th, the Ministry of Education also detailed measures for borrowing books, enrolling students, and maintaining classes during extraordinary times and telegraphed them to the relevant provinces, cities, and schools for compliance.

<h3>Armed Police Guard the British Concession Post Office in Tianjin</h3>
<p>British Government Studies Response to Japanese Memorandum's Procedural Errors</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Japanese authorities sent a memorandum to the Consular Corps, stating their intention to take over the British Concession Post Office, the wireless telegraph office, and the French Concession's Chinese telegraph office. The Consular Corps has remained silent regarding discussions with the Japanese authorities on this matter. However, it is rumored that both sides view procedural errors in the memorandum as the cause of the misunderstanding, which has now been clarified. Meanwhile, the consuls, including the British Consul, are awaiting instructions from their respective governments, so the matter is currently stalled. The Japanese authorities have repeatedly attempted to enter the telegraph and telephone offices without success. The British Concession Post Office is now guarded by armed police. According to non-official sources, demanding that a Chinese organization hand over the post office to the Japanese is unprecedented. Public opinion holds that the political situation in North China is still undecided, so this matter cannot be discussed. (Central News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>[London] The Japanese Consulate in Tianjin informed the Consular Corps yesterday that Japan would soon take over the Chinese Post Office and wireless telegraph office in the British Concession, as well as the Chinese telegraph office in the French Concession. After this news reached here, the British government is now studying how to respond. Officials believe that the Chinese Post Office in the British Concession of Tianjin is subordinate to the Tianjin Chinese Postal Administration, which is now in the hands of the Japanese authorities. Establishing an inspection agency is very easy and there is no need to set up another mail inspection agency in the British Concession. (Havas, Central News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>[London] Reuters reports that since the Japanese expressed their intention to take over the Chinese Post Office in the British and French Concessions of Tianjin, the British government has been actively considering the new situation in Tianjin. This is because the Japanese action would put British mail in Tianjin at risk of being inspected by the Japanese. However, what kind of attitude the UK will adopt is still unknown.

<h3>Japanese Consul in Shantou Lowers Flag and Returns Home</h3>

<p>[Xiamen] All Japanese Taiwanese in Shantou have evacuated. Japanese Consul Yamaki and his staff left Shantou aboard the "Fujian Maru" on the 12th. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Still Patrol Qingdao</h3>
<p>[Qingdao] After the Qingdao Municipal Government protested against the unauthorized patrols by Japanese police and volunteer corps in the city, they have now received a reply from the Japanese Consulate. They still use protecting the Japanese as an excuse, saying they have no other intention, but do not admit to carrying weapons. Currently, Japanese police are still patrolling at night, and we are also stepping up our defenses. Most of the Japanese women and children here have been evacuated to their home country, but the able-bodied men have all stayed. Two Japanese destroyers, the "Chiyuki" and "Fubuki," arrived in Qingdao around 1:00 PM on the 11th. There are now a total of four Japanese warships stationed here. (Central News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>[Qingdao] There are currently four Japanese warships and eleven British, American, and French warships docked in Qingdao. The market is deserted, but the people remain calm. Furthermore, the private police at major stations along the Jiaoji Railway have mostly changed into Chinese clothing to serve. A limited number of Japanese nationals from Qingdao and along the Jiaoji Line will return home on the 17th. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[Qingdao] The Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao, Otori, issued a statement today, firmly denying the rumor of a complete evacuation of Japanese nationals from Qingdao. He said that while some Japanese families have left the country, it is not a complete evacuation, and Qingdao is a very safe place. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 12th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Deployment of Large Numbers of Warships to Shanghai Causes Considerable Unease in London</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Occupy Tianjin Post Office; Britain, America, and France to Protest</p>
<p>[London] This morning, all British newspapers prominently featured the sudden tension in Shanghai, accompanied by photos from the 1932 Shanghai Incident. However, due to the short time frame, there was no time for commentary after receiving the news. The danger in Shanghai, compared to the conflict in North China, naturally attracts more attention from the British public regarding the true nature of Japan's harm. Although the government has not yet seen detailed reports, it does not want to ignore the severity of the situation. It is expected that the government will make every effort to persuade China and Japan in the hope of easing the situation and avoiding the danger of a prairie fire. However, Britain will not take coercive action. It is believed that many influential Japanese are also alarmed and uneasy about the current trend of affairs in China. According to observers, the Japanese Navy's demonstration in Shanghai may not be aimed at provocation, but rather to make the Shanghai public, the nerve center of China, aware of the strength of the Japanese military and understand Japan's determination to achieve its ambitions in North China. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>[London] People here are currently pessimistic about the Sino-Japanese situation. Recent developments in Shanghai have caused increasing anxiety. However, a mutually acceptable peaceful resolution is not absolutely hopeless. According to stock market brokers, today, both Chinese and Japanese bonds fell compared to last night, China by 2% and Japan by 1%. Market conditions are normal with very little trading. In fact, the price decline is due to a lack of buyers, not pressure from sellers. Sellers are not selling en masse, otherwise market prices would be even lower. (Central News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>[London] After the incident at Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport, Japan suddenly dispatched many warships to the Huangpu River. After this news reached London, the general public has been deeply impressed, believing that these warships, including cruisers, have a shallow draft and can sail up the river, heading for Nanjing. If so, the conflict between China and Japan will become generalized. Military figures in Britain believe that if China lays mines on the Yangtze River, Japanese warships will not be able to sail upstream. (Havas, Central News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>[London] As the situation in the Far East becomes increasingly tense, there is considerable unease here. It is said that the British government is maintaining close contact with the US and French governments. It is also said that after Japanese troops occupied the Tianjin Post Office, the British and French governments are expected to issue a joint protest. (National Maritime Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Militarism Promotes US-Russian Cooperation</h3>
<p>If Japanese Troops Invade Outer Mongolia, the Soviet Union Will Take Action</p>
<p>[Moscow] Japan has now begun to invade northern China again, and its actions may expand Japan's sphere of influence to the border of Outer Mongolia. In light of this, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs is taking advantage of every opportunity to express its shared emphasis on the amity between Russia and the United States to the American people. After US Secretary of State Hull issued a declaration on the 16th of last month explaining his peace policy, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov was the first foreign official to respond. Litvinov also took the opportunity to reiterate the proposals previously put forward by his country at the disarmament conference, advocating the establishment of a permanent peace conference to respond to Hull. Regarding the relations between Japan and Russia, sources say that if necessary, the Soviet Union is prepared to retreat to the Ural Mountains to avoid war with Japan. Recent events such as the Heilongjiang incident and the robbery of the Soviet Consulate in Tianjin show that the Soviet Union does not intend to be easily drawn into the vortex of Far Eastern disputes. However, if Japan attacks Outer Mongolia, the Siberian Railway will be seriously threatened, and the Soviet Union will naturally abide by its mutual assistance obligations to Outer Mongolia and take action. As for the rumored secret agreement between China and Russia, Japanese sources here have no knowledge of it and say that there is also no evidence to date regarding the Soviet Union's supply of arms to China. (Havas, Central News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Observers recently stated that the attitude of Britain and France toward the Spanish issue, and especially the Far Eastern issue, has disappointed the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now making every effort to approach the United States and trying to encourage American public opinion to pay attention to the Sino-Japanese disputes in the Far East, believing that the only country that can make Japan back down is the United States. In addition, the rapid fall of Beijing also disappointed the Soviet newspapers, believing that the loss of Beijing was due to the activities of traitors and Japanese spies, similar to how the city of Bilbao in Spain was misled by the spies of a certain faction in Toros. It is reported that those conspirators at the time gave the Nationalist army a map of the "Iron Belt Line" outside Bilbao, which resulted in its being captured in one fell swoop.

<h3>Typhoon Moves Toward Fujian and Zhejiang Coasts</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to the Central Meteorological Observatory, the typhoon had moved to the sea about 400 kilometers northeast of Taiwan on the afternoon of the 12th, with its center located between 126 degrees east longitude and 25.5 degrees north latitude. It is moving northwest-west, and the speed has decreased, but the wind force is very strong. Strong winds and rain have occurred in the East China Sea. If the wind direction does not change, the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang will be attacked. (Central News Agency, 12th)</p>
<h3>Yu Fu River Breaches Its Banks, Flooding Jinan's Northern Commercial Port</h3>
<p>50,000 Citizens Defend and Block the Flood All Night; Water Level in the Middle Reaches a Turning Point</p>
<p>[Jinan] The Yu Fu River breached its banks tonight, and the water has flooded the northern commercial port and factory area. Many factories are surrounded by water. The River Bureau has formulated a plan to divert the flow on one side and block the source on the other. Because the breach is a vast expanse of water, with no soil to be found, it was decided to transport materials by boat to block it, and 200 large boats of the Yellow River Commission were prepared to transport stone. Yesterday, the flow at the breach was 500 cubic meters per second, the water level was one meter away, and today the flow has decreased to 400 cubic meters per second, the water is one meter lower, gradually reaching a turning point. Residents of the northern commercial port are relocating to the southern commercial port to avoid the flood. 50,000 citizens are building embankments and blocking the flood all night, illuminating the area like daytime. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] The water level in the middle reaches of the Yellow River is slightly decreasing today, while both upstream and downstream are rising. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] This morning, the water from the breach of the Yu Fu River flowed eastward along the Xiaoqing River, passing through the northern commercial port. The water is flowing in low-lying areas, and the houses have not been flooded. However, the road from the city to Luokou has been blocked by water. 50,000 citizens set out to build an embankment along the south bank of the Xiaoqing River to prevent the water from flowing south. This morning, the water level of the Yellow River at Luokou has fallen by 1.8 inches, and there has been a turning point. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] The water from the breach of the Yu Fu River on the morning of the 11th first divided into two streams, flowing eastward and then into the Xiaoqing River, flowing southeast. At 6:00 PM, it had reached the Yanmazhuang Kuangshan area, 18 miles from Jinan, and the flow rate was slow. The provincial government summoned technical personnel from various agencies and the Flood Prevention Committee, and the military and civilians worked together to prevent the flood from affecting the provincial capital. The water level is four to five feet deep. The Jinpu Railway intersects the city, and the embankment on the north side is more than ten meters high. At the time of the breach, they were blocking the culvert to prevent water from coming south. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Yellow River's surge is of great concern to all sectors. According to relevant sources, the flood season of the Yellow River will end around August 10th at the latest, after which there will be no danger. Recently, the water in the Shandong section of the Yellow River has risen sharply due to the passage of a hurricane and continuous heavy rains, and the river channel is narrow and cannot flow smoothly. Although the civil embankment of the Meng River has collapsed, it is still far from the main dike, and the water level upstream is not high, causing damage in the Liangshui area. There is also flooding in the Central Canal, and the reasons are similar to those of the Yellow River, but the damage is not very heavy. The water level in the Xiang River was quite dangerous a few days ago, but it has gradually decreased after the 10th. (Central News Agency, 12th)</p>
<h3>Xiang River Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>[Hankou] According to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, the middle reaches of the Xiang River have experienced repeated heavy rains, and the water level has been rising since the 11th. At 6:00 AM on the 12th, the water level at Yun County was 5.30 meters, an increase of 0.41 meters compared to 6:00 AM on the 11th. At Laokou, it was 86.85 meters, an increase of 0.49 meters. However, at Guicheng Nanhekou, it was 90.25 meters, a sudden increase of 3.13 meters, which is particularly serious. The bureau has telegraphed the various engineering offices and requested the provincial government to instruct the counties along the Xiang River to continue to take strict precautions together. It also noted that the water level at Shayang reached 43.9 meters at 3:00 AM on the 10th, which is one inch higher than the flood level of 1935. At present, dangerous projects have emerged one after another between Shayang and Xiantao, and the engineering office is working with the county magistrates to collect laborers to protect them day and night. However, the frequent heavy rains have affected the rescue work. (Central News Agency, 12th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Attack Jinghai Unsuccessfully</h3>
<p>Our Troops Fight Valiantly</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Recently, Japanese troops at the northern end of the Jinpu Line suddenly attacked south, breaking the temporary truce. On the night of the 8th, Japanese troops attacked Jinghai. After our troops fought bravely in response, a fierce battle lasting two hours ensued. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated north, withdrawing to the vicinity of Duliu Town. Our troops advanced to Jinghai Station and the surrounding area north of it. After our troops retreated north, they rushed to build fortifications in Duliu for days, and actively transferred reinforcements from Tianjin. On the morning of the 9th, many newly arrived Japanese troops arrived in Duliu, and the Japanese artillery from Liangwang was also moved to Duliu. At the same time, our troops were deployed in Jinghai, preparing for a fierce battle. Also, at about 8:00 AM on the same day, two Japanese aircraft arrived in Jinghai to scout and strafed the station at low altitude, fortunately without causing casualties. At about 11:00 AM, four more Japanese aircraft flew to the bird factory to scout and dropped three bombs, all of which landed outside the station. Two bombs exploded, but did not cause any casualties. At 2:00 PM, Japanese troops suddenly came south from Duliu again, attacking Jinghai. Our troops bravely fought back, with one soldier worth a hundred. For a time, the fierce fighting was extremely intense. The Japanese troops were unable to cross the line and returned to Duliu, and the sound of battle ceased. (9th)</p>

<h3>Ancient Temple Ruins from the Ming Dynasty Discovered in Anhui; Secluded Cave Used to Hide Beauties</h3>
<p>Bricks and Stones in the Cave Are Exquisitely Beautiful</p>
<p>Huizhou Correspondence: There is a mountain named Wulishi, located 15 miles from Changxi, She County, which is majestic and precipitous, as high as the clouds. The mountain carbon is the peak of Wulijian, and the terrain at the top of the peak is flat. Over the years, it has been reclaimed and cultivated by mountain farmers, turning barren land into fertile land. Recently, a farmer was working on the mountain and struck something with his hoe, hearing a sound. Upon careful examination, he uncovered a large stone slab, engraved with delicate and beautiful patterns. Flipping the stone over, he discovered a large cave, about ten feet deep. The bricks and stones inside the square cave were all carved with flowers, exquisitely beautiful. The farmer went down the mountain and told the story, which deeply moved the curiosity of the general public, who flocked to see it. According to elderly farmers in nearby villages, in the Ming Dynasty, there was a Tiehu Cave Monk Temple on the mountain, similar to the former Honglian Temple. Because the abbot used a kind of evil art to lure young women into the cave as a place to hide beauties, the people at the time could not interfere. Later, it was destroyed by lightning, and the temple disappeared. Now, the mountain farmers have removed all the carved floral bricks and stones in the cave to avoid the abandonment and damage of antiquities in the field and are carefully preserving them.

<h3>Random Notes from Rural Hubei</h3>
<p>— Cheng Jun</p>
<p>"Night Boats" of Konglong</p>
<p>Traveling ninety miles east from Wuxue to Xiaochikou, one enters the territory of Huangmei. This place originally belonged to Jiujiang County, Jiangxi, and was managed across the river. The Executive Yuan, in order to facilitate administration and manage the construction and defense of river dikes, specifically assigned it to Huangmei. It has only been a few months since the transfer. At that time, someone suggested merging the area south of Konglong, which belonged to Mei, with Xiaochi to establish a new riverside county. However, it was considered unnecessary and was abandoned. Xiaochikou is located on the north bank of the Yangtze River and faces Jiujiang across the river. There are commercially operated ferries connecting the two places. Hundreds of shops sell cotton and grain, which are mostly exported from here, so there are many cotton and grain shops. The farmland in the nearby Fengyi and Feng'er Townships is very productive, but the terrain is low-lying and prone to flooding. All rely on the river dikes for protection. From here to Konglong, all belong to the lower townships of Huangmei, also known as water townships, which are divided into eight major enclosure areas. The safety of the people's lives and property depends entirely on the dikes and enclosures, so repairs and defenses are carried out with great effort.</p>
<p>Between Xiaochi and Konglong, a journey of forty miles, there is a small port named Jiagang, which can be navigated by sailboats. It is the main means of transportation, mostly traveling at night, called night boats. Amidst the rippling green waves, they weave back and forth like shuttles, with fishing songs answering each other, leaving a leisurely aftertaste that captivates the soul. This is during the summer, and the joy of night sailing outweighs the hardship. If it is in the cold winter, with wind and snow mixed together, and hard ice touching the face, then the skin will crack with every touch, and there is only hardship without joy. There are a total of more than 300 of these small boats. Whether carrying people or goods, it only costs five or six jiao per trip. Half of the boatmen are farmers, and half are professionals. In the past, local ruffians and bullies organized so-called "wharves" and forcefully collected "wharf fees," taking up to 60% of the earnings. For example, if the boat fare was five jiao, the boatman would only get two jiao after working hard all night, while the ruffians and bullies would sit and collect their share. Nothing in the world is more unfair than this. This had been going on for many years, but the county government could not effectively crack down on it, and it even produced various reactive effects.</p>
<p>Konglong is an important market town in Huangmei. Most of the streets are on the dike. Because it is located at a transportation hub, commerce is still prosperous. The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Wu Shangda, is courageous and willing to take responsibility. The construction of electric lights and other facilities were accomplished through his efforts. The county's first primary school is located here and is well managed. From Konglong to the county seat is fifty miles, and it can be reached by wheelbarrow (earth cart). In the past, it was a post road, paved with stone slabs, making it very convenient for travelers. In 1928, a county magistrate surnamed Li built another motor road, forcibly occupying farmland as a base, and dug up the stone slabs from the old road. When it rained, the muddy ground would engulf the wheels. Not only did the motor road never connect to the warehouse, but the old road also became impassable. To this day, the farmers whose land was occupied and the rickshaw pullers who are inconvenienced by the road all criticize him. This shows that every time something is done, if it is not first considered for the benefit of the people, the result will inevitably be failure. However, this road is still important, and it should be repaired as soon as possible to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>On the road to the county, one passes through the Baihu Ferry, which is said to be the ancient Zhaokai, but this cannot be verified. However, the county is actually located at the border of Wu and Chu, and the former course of the Yangtze River was indeed between Xiaochi and Konglong. It seems credible that Zhaokai was located here. Thirty miles further is Shilipu. During the Taiping Rebellion, it was a military stronghold. Qing officials such as Zeng Guofan, Bao Chao, and Duolong'a, as well as Taiping Heavenly Kingdom King Chen Yucheng, fought hundreds of large and small battles here. Desolate tombs stand everywhere, the burial places of these brave soldiers. To this day, the name "Four-Eyed Dog" still resonates among the people. Now the county is the thoroughfare connecting Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui. If there is a military incident, it will still be a hotly contested place.</p>
<p>The city walls of the county seat are high and majestic, and rivers surround it. When bandits were rampant, they attacked the city with several divisions. Because the squad leader Ma Yao Kui fought bravely and the people worked together, the surrounding villages were red-colored. However, the small isolated city was preserved and never fell. The whole territory is still considered peaceful. The county middle school is located outside the south gate, the central primary school is located in the city, and there is also an education center with very complete equipment.</p>
<p>The entire county is divided into four districts, half of which are mountainous, known as the upper townships, and half of which are waterlogged, known as the lower townships. The upper townships often suffer from drought, and the lower townships often suffer from floods. The main agricultural product of the upper townships is rice, and the main agricultural product of the lower townships is cotton. In years of good harvest, in addition to self-sufficiency, some can also be shipped out for sale. The people are kind and hardworking, know etiquette and abide by the law, and are known for being easy to get along with. However, since 1926, they have been disturbed by red bandits, and in addition, there was a major flood in 1931 and a major drought in 1934. The rural economy has been completely bankrupt. The farmers in the surrounding villages are scantily clad and cannot get enough to eat. The people living in the mountains do not even know what flavors are like. In the past, when faced with disasters, they could still travel together to other places to escape famine, but now this is also prohibited. In the midst of poverty, they do not even have time to save the dying, and officials urging the collection of taxes are still constantly knocking on the door, even using the status of disaster victims who "cannot live without relief" to receive relief money on one hand and use it to pay taxes on the other. This kind of contradictory thing makes people laugh and cry.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>A Traitor Arrested in Xiagang Town</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 10th, a man from north of the Yangtze River, Yan Zhongxian, was found loitering on the streets of Xiagang Town in the Seventh District, copying down house numbers and spying on the Tiecheng Road. He was spotted by Fu Bingtai, an investigator from the First Squad of the Security Team, who stepped forward to arrest him. He was taken to the headquarters of the Eleventh Battalion, where copper coins and a dark mark of "Red Line 60" on his collar were found. On suspicion of being a traitor, he was taken to the county for questioning and detention.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Protecting Highway Bridges</p>
<p>With the situation in Hebei critical and national distress severe, Magistrate Long Tiyao of this county is deeply concerned that unscrupulous traitors might take the opportunity to disrupt public order and damage transportation. Having been ordered to pay close attention to highway bridges within the jurisdiction, he issued orders to all districts on the 10th, instructing the heads of townships, villages, and baojia along the three highway lines of Xicheng, X湾 (Xiwan), and Xiyi to rotate strong laborers to guard the bridges day and night.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>County Chamber of Commerce Stabilizes Finances</p>
<p>Due to the serious situation and the lack of a standard exchange rate between legal tender and copper coins, the exchange rate has recently plummeted to over 3,800 文 (cash) per yuan. The Jiangdu County Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting at 10 a.m. on the 10th, gathering representatives from Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and other banks, as well as Shixing, Dexing, Shengyu, and other money shops and tobacco and exchange businesses, to discuss measures to stabilize the situation. They resolved to adhere to the Ministry of Finance's order that each yuan should not be exchanged for less than 3,000 文 (cash), with violators to be punished as disrupting financial order. A notice was submitted to the county government to announce the exchange rates on the signs of tobacco and exchange businesses, prohibiting the hoarding of copper coins for speculation. Exchange businesses were allowed to collect handling fees for incoming and outgoing transactions. The public was encouraged to report any instances of non-compliance, and the county government was requested to order police and security agencies along the river to strictly prohibit the export of copper coins to maintain the market. The banks were also requested to transport auxiliary currency to Yangzhou as much as possible for circulation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Traitors Attempt to Destroy Railway Tracks</p>
<p>At 5:30 p.m. on the 9th, the railway tracks of the Yongcao Railway, 46 kilometers east of Yuyao Station, were found to have been set on fire with kerosene poured on the sleepers. Fortunately, a patrol team from the Yao City Public Security Bureau was passing by and extinguished the fire with water. Only half a track was burned, and station staff were dispatched to repair it. Police Chief Wang Kaiye questioned farmers in the fields, who said that two people had been seen loitering there, but they had not paid attention and did not know if they had committed arson. It is suspected that traitors attempted to destroy the railway tracks and disrupt transportation. The incident was reported to the government authorities, who telegraphed nearby military and police to strictly apprehend the culprits. The railway authorities also telegraphed all stations to be vigilant.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>More Traitors Apprehended</p>
<p>As various counties in Zhejiang Province have discovered traitors, the military administration has been paying close attention to their arrest. Over 40 people have been successively apprehended and handed over to the Security Command for interrogation. Recently, another seven or eight people were apprehended, including several who were seriously involved. One was found stockpiling rosin near the aviation school with the intention of arson. Another was apprehended at Minghu Bathing Pool, carrying 700 yuan in cash and over 5,000 yuan in bank deposits. He claimed to have worked as an engineer on the PingSui Railway and had intended to sabotage the railway. Another was arrested at the Huaxing Hotel, and two appointment letters from the puppet state of Manchukuo were found, along with hidden markings on his shirt. They are currently under strict interrogation, and the search continues to ensure no one escapes. Xia Dehou, a traitor apprehended in Yuyao, has been executed by firing squad.</p>
<p>Building a Dam at Guanyintang</p>
<p>Guanyintang on the north bank of the Qiantang River is subject to severe erosion from tidal surges. To maintain the safety of the embankment, the Water Conservancy Bureau has been approved by the provincial government to allocate funds to build two spur dikes to divert the flow of the river. Construction began last month and has been progressing rapidly. The stone block work for the length of the dam has been completed, and the width work is 50% complete. If the supply of stone materials is sufficient, it is expected to be completed on schedule by the end of September.</p>
<h3>Taizhou</h3>
<p>Unscrupulous Merchants Buying Wheat</p>
<p>Unscrupulous merchants in Taizhou, Haidou, and other places have been buying wheat from Jianhai, Wenling, Huangyan, and other counties since the new wheat crop came on the market in early summer. Some farmers, greedy for temporary small profits, have been selling wheat, causing the price of wheat to soar. According to investigations, since the new wheat came on the market until recently, about 100,000 bags have been loaded onto ships and exported to Shanghai, Ningbo, and other ports. Recently, these unscrupulous merchants have been buying and hoarding wheat due to the tense situation, hoping to make huge profits in the future. However, as the wheat in Jianhai, Wenling, and Huangyan has been bought up, they have sent people to TianTai, XianJu, and other townships to continue buying. It is reported that the authorities have already issued a ban, but these unscrupulous merchants still hold export permits obtained in the past, so they are still buying in the countryside. Whether they can still export is still a question.</p>
<h3>Shijiazhuang on the National Defense Line</h3>
<p>— Xi Min</p>
<p>Before the Pinghan Railway was opened to traffic, Shijiazhuang was just a small village where dozens of farmers lived. Later, with the opening of the Pinghan Railway and the Zhengtai Railway terminating here, the population increased greatly and commerce prospered. Various factories, such as spinning, glass, match, and tobacco industries, were established one after another. After one or two decades of operation, it has now become a large town with a population of 60,000.</p>
<p>After the opening of the Zhengtai Railway, coal, cotton, and other miscellaneous grains produced in Shanxi Province were exported from here, transferred to Pinghan trains, and shipped to Tianjin for sale at home and abroad. Therefore, although Shijiazhuang is within the jurisdiction of the Huolu County District of Hebei Province, it is in fact the only economic, political, and military throat of Shanxi. The day after the reporter arrived in Shijiazhuang, he visited Manager Wu of the Shijiazhuang Central Bank. According to him, the value of coal from Shanxi coal mines and Jingxing coal mines that is transported through Shijiazhuang each year exceeds 10 million yuan, and the total amount of cotton and agricultural products from Shanxi that are exported through Shijiazhuang each year after autumn is about 40 to 50 million yuan. This further proves the importance of Shijiazhuang's position.</p>
<p>In the process of intensifying its aggression against Hebei and peeping into Shanxi, the enemy had long paid attention to Shijiazhuang. In the past, the Japanese loudly advocated the Cangshi Railway or the Jinshi Railway, both of which terminated in Shijiazhuang. If the Jinshi line, which the Japanese had been dreaming of, were one day built, the enemy's railway could quickly reach Shijiazhuang from the Beining Road from Tanggu via Tianjin, and further penetrate into Shanxi! At that time, the towering Taihang Mountains would probably not be able to stop the enemy's rampant advance!</p>
<p>However, the enemy's conspiracy ultimately did not succeed. The bloody battle at Lugouqiao (Marco Polo Bridge) has awakened the masses of the whole of China! China has stood up and will no longer retreat step by step! The enemy has probably fully realized that threats and deceptions can no longer smoothly complete their "cleverly seize" aggression policy! Really! Unless North China is turned into scorched earth, China is determined to use flesh and blood to limit the enemy's aggressive tentacles—the completion of the Jinshi Line. The Jinshi Railway is probably going to become a historical term!</p>
<p>After the Lugouqiao Incident broke out, the atmosphere in Shijiazhuang naturally became tense. The trains going up the line were busy all day, and the locomotive whistles kept making wild howls! The people of Shijiazhuang, who are full of wartime life experience (there were civil wars on the Pinghan Line during the Beiyang government era), know this very well. On the 27th of last month, the situation in Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin) suddenly changed, and Baoding became the only military and political center in Hebei. Japanese planes flew to Baoding one after another to bomb. Shijiazhuang is the most important place south of Baoding, so Japanese planes often patronized it to spy, and often swept down with machine guns. On the 4th of this month, a certain unit stationed here on orders fired at the enemy with anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns, but did not hit.</p>
<p>Most of the people doing business in Shijiazhuang are clients from Shanxi. In the past few days, many wealthy merchants who have money and nothing to do have reportedly left here for Shanxi. However, this is only a small minority. After the reporter arrived in Shijiazhuang and strolled through the streets, the shops were still operating as usual, and the residents were very calm and not panicked at all. According to Manager Wu of the Central Bank here, in the financial aspect, only the banknotes of the Hebei Provincial Bank have been affected by the fall of Pingjin, but as a result of the three banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and other banks, making every effort to maintain the situation, the market circulation is not inferior to other banknotes, so the finance is also very stable.</p>
<p>Before the Lugouqiao Incident, the local garrison was transferred to the front line. Although there were many troops coming and going here, they were all in transit, so there was a short period of time when there were no troops specifically responsible for maintaining the security of Shijiazhuang. After the 20th of last month, a certain unit was moved here to specifically take charge of the security of Shijiazhuang. As soon as the reporter arrived in Shijiazhuang, the impression he got of the garrison was that they were full of energy and strictly disciplined, and he felt very happy in his heart. The garrison commander is very serious about the air defense of Shijiazhuang. In addition to holding air defense exercises from time to time, he also sends brothers to inform residents along the streets about air defense methods. Since Shijiazhuang was bombed by Feng army planes when Shi Yousan, who was stationed here, rebelled in 1931, the residents have a more real understanding of air raids than the average inland residents! Almost every household has dug a cave to prevent airplanes from dropping bombs. Therefore, the air defense of Shijiazhuang is somewhat better than that of the inland areas.</p>
<p>In recent times, the traitors in the Shijiazhuang area have been quite rampant. The 4th of this month happened to be the first day the reporter arrived here, and eight more traitors were captured near the Pinghan and Zhengtai railway stations. Many destructive items such as hand grenades were found on them. According to the reporter's inquiries with the local military and police agencies, the total number of traitors captured in recent times has been no less than several hundred, but the detailed inside story cannot be known because the military law agencies are extremely secretive. However, it is said that a large-scale judgment will be made within days.</p>
<p>The issue of traitors in Shijiazhuang reminded me of a passage from someone on the train yesterday. The person told the reporter that the bombing of three ammunition cars in Baoding on the 30th of last month was suspicious. The military cars were parked in the station without any obvious targets or special reasons. The Japanese planes dropped bombs and hit the military cars accurately. Most people were surprised by the accuracy of the Japanese planes' bombing, so some people asserted that it was due to the traitors' tip-off. Whether this guess is true or false still needs to be thoroughly investigated, but today the traitor activity throughout the country is indeed a very serious problem. The reporter took photos along the way from Zhengzhou to Shijiazhuang, and was questioned by the military and police. It can be seen that the authorities are very serious about maintaining security and paying attention to and guarding against various suspicious people. This can make the traitors slightly restrained, but I always feel that the most effective way to punish traitors for disrupting the rear is to have civilian organizations carry it out. Therefore, the government in the future should pay more attention to opening up the people's national salvation movement and guiding the people's national salvation movement.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Responding to the Enemy's Conspiracy with Resistance</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>After the Hongqiao Airport incident, the atmosphere in Shanghai suddenly became tense. We recognized from the beginning that this incident was a conspiracy by the enemy to provoke incidents as a pretext for a large-scale invasion of our Yangtze River basin. Therefore, when our municipal government authorities expressed a willingness to seek a solution through diplomatic channels with a fair and reasonable attitude, the Japanese side, on the one hand, engaged in frantic agitation, and on the other hand, made unreasonable demands on our municipal government. By the past two days, a large number of Japanese marines and troops had arrived, posing a clear military threat to us. We have completely understood the ambition of Japanese imperialism. Now we have no other choice but to respond to the enemy's conspiracy with resolute resistance.</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese provocation in Shanghai this time, we must point out that its conspiracy has several motives. First, it believes that it can achieve the same effect in Shanghai by copying the old trick of invading Pingjin. Therefore, after the Hongqiao Airport incident, it agreed to mediation on the one hand, and on the other hand, it spread rumors and agitation and secretly mobilized naval fleets to come. As of yesterday, 28 Japanese warships were deployed in the Huangpu River, and the number of marines also suddenly increased from 3,000 to 7,000 to 8,000. Now it believes that the military deployment has been completed, so it does not hesitate to reveal its ferocious face and make open military threats. Second, after the fall of Pingjin, the strategy decided by the Japanese side was to temporarily suspend its advance on the Jinpu and Pinghan lines and first focus on developing the PingSui line. It attempted to seize Nankou while we were relatively negligent in Chahar and Suiyuan, occupy Chahar Province, and then enter Suiyuan, and then use its military superiority to turn around and plot to capture southern Hebei and Shandong provinces. However, the enemy artillery has been fiercely bombing Nankou recently, and we have been firmly defending it, and the attention of the whole country has been focused on that area, not allowing the invaders to carry out their ambitions again. Because of this, the Japanese warlords decided to use a strategy of attacking in the east and attacking in the west, harassing everywhere, and provoking conflicts in Shanghai to contain our military forces from going north. However, this strategy certainly does not mean that the Japanese side has "no territorial ambitions in Shanghai and the Yangtze River basin" (this is a common phrase used by Japanese imperialism). If Japanese imperialism feels that it can take advantage of the situation in this area, it will still brazenly disregard everything and occupy this place with a large number of troops, and then make overall military and diplomatic threats.</p>
<p>However, in today's situation, all the enemy's conspiracies have long been seen through by us. What the enemy calls "no territorial ambitions in North China" proves that it has ambitions to invade territory. What the enemy calls "not hoping to expand the Shanghai incident" proves that it hopes to expand the situation. Bombing Nankou with artillery and sending fleets to force Shanghai are ironclad evidence and need not be argued. However, in today's world, our country, whether above or below, has also learned a painful lesson from the enemy's conspiracy of aggression. We recognize that wherever the enemy goes, north or south, it is our front line. We know that any evasion, any concession, any illusion of compromise with the enemy is no longer possible. We can only respond to the enemy's conspiracy with resistance, and we can only repay the lesson the enemy has given us with a serious lesson.</p>
<p>The situation in Shanghai is on the brink of a major collision. We will not have the slightest retreat, nor can we have the slightest retreat. We must respond to the enemy's provocation conspiracy with all our strength.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Government Orders the Conscription of New Soldiers</h3>
<p>All Have Received Strict Military Education; Ready to Strike Back at Those Who Strike</p>
<p>[Moscow] Today, the Soviet Defense Committee issued an order that all young people born in 1915 who were not conscripted last year must enlist in September of this year, and the 1916 class must also be fully conscripted. At the same time, junior officers and their assistants who have completed a certain period of military service in the Red Army and border or internal defense will be released on long leave. (Reuters, Moscow, 11th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The News reports on the Red Army's conscription of new soldiers, saying, "The new soldiers conscripted by the Red Army this year are of unprecedentedly good qualifications. Most of them have graduated from middle school, and many of them are Voroshilov sharpshooters, cavalrymen, and parachutists, that is, talents who have received preliminary specialized training. In most cities and towns, one-quarter of those conscripted are Voroshilov sharpshooters, and there are many formally trained aircraft pilots. We will use this power to protect peace. Progressive people all over the world know that socialist countries volunteer for peace, but peace must be strengthened by the state to be guaranteed."</p>
<p>The Pravda said that the Red Army has a very high cultural level and is the best tactical and political school. "In 1912, 33% of Russian conscripts were illiterate, while only 3/10,000 of Soviet conscripts last year were illiterate. The enemy abroad is preparing to attack our country, but we are not disturbed at all. We are deeply convinced of our own power and are sufficient to win the final victory. The Red Army will strike back at those who strike, and crush the enemy at the place where they come from."</p>
<p>The Red Star said, "While the Red Army conscripts young workers and peasants into the army, it also dismisses tens of thousands of officers and soldiers who have received political and military training in the army to society. Factories, collectives, and state-owned farms will obtain a large number of fighters, workers, party, and Soviet organization talents who are loyal to socialism, leaders of collective farms, cultural workers, and active national defense guards. They have made great progress in military, political, and cultural aspects during their two years in the Red Army. They have a thorough understanding of combat techniques, and officers and political workers are especially full of revolutionary courage, full of Bolshevik awareness and military responsibility, and full of revolutionary vigilance and determination to eliminate the people's enemies." (Tass, 11th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Ashkhabad newspaper today carried a brief communiqué stating that the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic has been thoroughly purged, and many major government leaders have been dismissed, including the chairman of the Central Executive Committee, nine members of the Executive Committee, and the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, all of whom were called enemies of the people. Turkmenistan is the last of the Central Asian republics to be purged. In addition, the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union has appointed Shaburova as the Commissioner of Social Welfare, the first woman to hold this position.

<h3>Litvinov Goes Abroad for Vacation</h3>
<p>The Vacant Post of Foreign Commissioner is Temporarily Held by Potemkin</p>
<p>[Moscow] Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov has taken a vacation, and the vacant post is temporarily held by Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin. (Tass, 11th)</p>
<p>[Vienna] Litvinov arrived here this morning and stayed at the Soviet Embassy, rejecting all social engagements and living in seclusion. It is reported that Litvinov came here purely to consult a famous doctor, Aibannre, and will soon transfer to Karlsbad, Czech Republic, for vacation. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Moscow Soviet Plenary Session decided that the former Moscow Soviet Chairman Bulganin has now been promoted to Chairman of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) People's Committee, and should be relieved of his original post. Sidolov was re-elected as Chairman of the Moscow Soviet. In addition, the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Russian Federation decided to appoint Ms. Shaburova as the Russian Federation People's Commissioner of Social Insurance, and Batayev as the Food and Vegetable Commissioner. The Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union removed Batayev from his original post as Deputy Commissioner of the Soviet Food Industry. (Tass, 12th)</p>
<h3>Italian Army Holds Grand Exercise</h3>
<p>In Sicily</p>
<p>[Rome] The Italian Army is scheduled to hold exercises in Sicily from the 12th to the 18th of this month. Prime Minister Mussolini will go to observe the exercises and has arrived on the island. He issued a statement, stating that the eyes of the world are now focused on Sicily, and that a new stage in world history has now begun. This stage is mainly composed of the establishment of the Italian Empire, which is of great significance. The Prime Minister is now scheduled to deliver an important political speech at the Port of Palermo in Sicily after the end of the grand exercises. Most observers believe that this speech will be mostly directed at foreign countries. The Prime Minister delivered a speech in Milan on November 1 last year, explaining the outline of Italian foreign policy and first mentioned the "political axis" of Italy and Germany. The speech to be delivered at the Port of Palermo this time will roughly explain the situation in Europe, which has been improved, and that there is a real possibility of approaching between Britain and Italy, and that Italy and France can also approach each other, which is the best condition for maintaining a lasting balance in Europe.

<h3>Two Iraqi Military Officers Assassinated Together</h3>
<p>⊙ Mosul: Iraqi Chief of Staff Siduoyi and Air Force Commander Jiawate were shot dead by a soldier while boarding a plane to Turkey to participate in army exercises. Many believe that the assassination of the two military officers together must be a political conspiracy. (Haitong Telegraph, 12th)</p>

<h3>Brazil Borrows Warships from the United States</h3>
<p>Argentina Strongly Opposes; the United States Claims Not to Discriminate Against Other Countries</p>
<p>⊙Argentine Capital: Argentine public opinion is still criticizing Brazil's plan to borrow six cruisers from the United States. Foreign Minister Lamas is still unwilling to express his opinion, but it is generally known that the Argentine Navy Department believes that this matter violates common practice and is enough to cause concern. A former customs officer recently told a reporter from Havas that Argentina recently sent a fleet of warships to travel to various ports in the Pacific Ocean and crossed the Atlantic Ocean to visit European countries. Brazil probably saw the strength of the Argentine fleet and expanded its navy. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>⊙Argentine Capital: The Argentine government strongly opposes the United States' plan to lend six destroyers to Brazil. The Navy Generals Conference held a meeting this month and immediately decided in principle to order one cruiser and seven destroyers from British shipyards. It is reported that these warships will not be delivered until next year. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Due to the desire to ease the emotions of various Latin American countries regarding the US government's plan to lend six destroyers to Brazil, Undersecretary of State Welles has reported to President Roosevelt, approving his invitation to the ambassadors of Argentina and Chile to hold talks and explain everything to them. He then issued a statement saying that the US government's move was to express friendship to Brazil and did not discriminate against other Latin American countries, and did not conflict with the London Naval Treaty. At this point, Welles presented telegrams from embassies stationed in various Latin American countries, and said that the negative impressions felt by these countries were not correct and would be dispelled within days. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Democratic Senator Walsh recently proposed a bill that would allow the United States to lend its warships to various South American countries for the purpose of training the naval personnel of those countries. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to hold a temporary meeting tomorrow to discuss it. The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Pittman, recently told the press that he believes that this proposal poses no danger to either the United States or the countries of South America.

<h3>Palestinian Christian Rights</h3>
<p>Roman Curia Asks Britain for Protection; Arabs Oppose Partition</p>
<p>[London] British Catholic sources recently revealed that the Roman Curia submitted a document to the British government some days ago, outlining the rights of Christians in Palestine. It stated that unless these rights are guaranteed first, the implementation of the Palestinian partition plan would inevitably encounter serious obstacles. Furthermore, Palestine is the birthplace of Christianity, and it would be unthinkable to resolve the Palestinian issue without prior consultation with the Curia. Likewise, it would be inconceivable for the monasteries and religious organizations belonging to Christian churches within Palestine to be placed under the administration of either the Jewish or Arab communities. In addition, Orthodox Christian figures have stated that the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem also intends to raise the issue of the future status of Orthodox monasteries. In summary, British political circles now believe that the Palestinian issue is extremely complex. Therefore, whereas it was previously handled solely by the Colonial Office, henceforth, all diplomatic aspects of the matter will be handled by the Foreign Office. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[London] The Zionist Congress passed a resolution yesterday, endorsing the Executive Committee's engagement with the British government regarding the Palestinian issue. This action is tantamount to accepting in principle the partition plan proposed by the Royal Commission, but with the condition that it be more favorable to the Jews. It is reported that the Jews unanimously support this resolution by the Zionist Congress. However, the Arabs continue to express opposition to the partition plan in principle, arguing that according to this plan, the Jews would receive the richest coastal fruit-producing region and the Galilee region, which has the most olive groves. They also state that most of the railways and highways would be in Jewish hands, while the Arabs would receive barren mountains and other unproductive lands. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>⊙ Jerusalem The Zionist Congress, which recently convened in Zurich, Switzerland, passed a resolution advocating for the acceptance in principle of the partition plan proposed by the British Commission. However, it stipulated that the Executive Committee should engage in negotiations with the British government regarding the establishment of a Jewish state. Jewish figures here have expressed considerable support for this resolution, but Arab figures are expressing extreme dissatisfaction, as they believe that the Jewish people have formally endorsed the partition of Palestine. It is generally speculated that this resolution will likely increase the anger of Arabs and Muslims towards the Palestinian partition plan. The Arab Higher Committee has reportedly received a letter from the leader of the Free Party in Tunis, French North Africa, protesting against this resolution passed by the Zionist Congress. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] A new Zionist movement was formed here today, led by the Russian anti-socialist Jabotinsky. It has already begun to criticize the resolution passed by the World Zionist Congress in Zurich, which advocates authorizing the Executive Committee to negotiate the partition of Palestine with the British authorities.

<h3>Britain and Germany Continuously Expel Each Other's Journalists</h3>
<p>France Also Expels a German Reporter</p>
<p>[Berlin] In retaliation for Britain's expulsion of three Berlin-based correspondents for German newspapers from London, the German government has also expelled Times correspondent Mr. Ebbutt. The Berlin Foreign Correspondents Association held a special meeting today, passing a resolution stating that the journalists express regret over the expulsion of the Times correspondent from Germany. The Association opposes in principle any government expulsion of foreign journalists due to their reporting activities. (National News Agency, via Haitian Telegraph, 11th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the German government's order for the Berlin-based correspondent of the London Times, Mr. Ebbutt, to leave the country within two weeks, German political figures have commented after the Foreign Correspondents Association passed a resolution protesting the decision. They say that the activities of many foreign journalists in Berlin exceed the scope of their profession and conflict with German interests. The German government naturally reserves the right to take appropriate measures to stop such activities. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] It has been confirmed here that Mr. Göss, a correspondent for the German News Agency stationed in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France, has received an expulsion order from the French Ministry of the Interior. Authoritative figures here have stated that this move is difficult to understand and seems unnecessary, as Mr. Göss is an intelligence officer for the German Embassy in Salamanca, and all of his diplomatic credentials state that he is to travel to Salamanca. Therefore, his presence in Saint-Jean-de-Luz is only temporary. In any case, he is expected to depart France to take up his post. (National News Agency, via Haitian Telegraph, 11th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Emperor Appeals for Restoration of Lost Territory</h3>
<p>[London] Emperor Selassie of Abyssinia today issued another appeal to the Christian churches, requesting that the League of Nations restore the territorial integrity of Abyssinia in accordance with the Covenant, and hoping to awaken the world's sympathy and gain the support of the churches. He concluded by vehemently protesting against Italy's rule in East Africa. (Haitian Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<h3>German Giant Aircraft Tests Transatlantic Flight</h3>
<p>[Berlin] The German aircraft "Nordmeer," the world's largest seaplane, departed from Travemünde this morning and arrived in Lisbon in the afternoon. It will fly to New York, marking the first step in Germany's plan to establish a transatlantic airmail service to compete with the aviation businesses jointly operated by Britain and the United States. The "Nordmeer" is a four-engine aircraft with a speed of 162 miles per hour. It carries a crew of four. The pilot is Mr. Blangenburg, who has crossed the South Atlantic a total of 43 times.

<h3>Germany Utilizes Garbage</h3>
<p>[Berlin] General Göring, the dictator of the Four-Year Plan, issued an order yesterday, instructing all municipal authorities in cities with populations of less than 35,000 to pay close attention to household and factory waste. All waste that can be used for remanufacturing or has practical applications should be utilized as much as possible, with particular attention to household waste, as factory waste has often already undergone a utilization process. It is believed that this measure will result in a large amount of metal, fiber, rubber, and other raw materials that can be remanufactured, thereby alleviating the shortage to some extent. (Haitian Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<h3>Drought in Southern United States</h3>
<p>[Washington] The Department of Agriculture announced today that a severe drought has occurred in the United States. Rainfall is scarce in the Great Plains region north of Texas, and the entire region is experiencing drought conditions, with the most severe conditions in western Oklahoma and northwestern New Mexico. The water level in the Mississippi River basin fluctuates frequently, and there are many areas with insufficient rainfall. Although wheat has already been harvested there, corn may be damaged.

<h3>The Urgent Transportation Problem Today</h3>
<p>— Rui Ling</p>
<p>The moment is pressing! We are intensifying our preparations for this time of crisis. This is a critical juncture for our nation to gamble on survival and resolve to live or die. We must exert every last bit of strength, shed every last drop of sweat and blood, and sacrifice everything we have to secure the dignity and survival of our nation.</p>
<p>Let's start with the most pressing points regarding transportation. The government officials in charge have probably already taken note of these or are already preparing for them. However, based on what I have thought of personally, I will bring them up again. Perhaps the wisdom of the many can provide points for reference. These are just some principles that do not seem to involve any confidentiality, so I am publishing them publicly, hoping to elicit more thorough opinions.</p>
<p>We are a weak country, and our first resolution when fighting foreign aggressors is to make sacrifices. In explaining the final moment in his speech, Mr. Wang Jingwei put forward the "scorched earth (resistance policy)" and gave the most thorough and clear explanation. Although this is a harsh sacrifice, it is an effective means of dealing with the enemy. In enemy-occupied areas, only piles of rubble remain. The enemy loses the target for economic exploitation. I ask you, even if some domains are captured, what is the significance to the enemy? The enemy wants to take over Tianjin and Pingjin in perfect condition, just to keep Tianjin and Pingjin as their supply base in the rear!</p>
<p>We must resolve to implement a scorched earth policy when dealing with the enemy. We must implement a strategy of fortified walls and clearing the fields! We must use a war of attrition, a war of consumption! Guerrilla warfare!</p>
<p>Therefore, in the areas we can protect, we must desperately protect everything. In the areas we cannot protect, we should relocate important items to safer areas in the rear as much as possible. When the final moment arrives, we should resolutely destroy everything so that the enemy cannot benefit. This is especially true for transportation equipment:</p>
<p>The past facts cause us too much pain! The September 18th Incident in Shenyang, not to mention the major losses of territory, sovereignty, and people, and the decline of the nation's and state's position, even in terms of transportation, the loss of vehicles is unknown! Vehicles can be moved at any time. After September 18th, railway transportation between Guanwai and Guannei was not completely cut off. As long as the person in charge of transportation (at that time, transportation in the Northeast was completely controlled by Gao Jiyi) paid a little attention, many vehicles in Guanwai could have been transferred to Guannei. However, as a result, even the vehicles of the Beining Railway itself were intercepted by the pseudo-Fengshan Railway! During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the Jinghu Railway also suffered extremely heavy losses. Although the matter was rushed and there was no time to prevent it, if the Jinghu Railway authorities had been prepared early, they could have at least reduced the losses!</p>
<p>It has long been known that North China will inevitably be the target of Japanese aggression! However, the Tangshan Locomotive Factory of the Beining Railway and the Changxindian Locomotive Factory of the Pinghan Railway are both located where Chinese railways have large-scale engine factories, and I have never heard of any preparations for relocation. Now they have all fallen into enemy hands! Enemy troops are stationed in the Tianjin, Tanggu, and Shanhaiguan areas, but the Beining Railway is now actively seeking to restore traffic! Who is the traffic being restored for? Who are the troops being transported for?</p>
<p>We will not talk about past events now. If we pay attention in time, we can still salvage a part.</p>
<p>① Among the Chinese railway locomotive factories, the Qingdao Locomotive Factory of the Jiaoji Railway is relatively large in scale. It is said that its scale is comparable to the Tangshan Factory of the Beining Railway. Important parts should be relocated as soon as possible to avoid falling into the hands of the enemy again. The Pukou Locomotive Factory of the Jinpu Railway and the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory of the Jinghu Railway are also under considerable threat from Japanese gunboats on the Yangtze River and aircraft in the air. The Railway Department originally had a plan to establish a general engine factory in Zhuzhou. Now that the situation is tense, it may be difficult to deliver ordered parts on time. It is better to relocate important parts from each railway factory to Zhuzhou or within Jiangxi Province first. In the future, major vehicle repairs will be the responsibility of the general engine factory, while minor repairs will still be handled by local factories on each railway.</p>
<p>② Railway workers, especially those with technical skills in engine, engineering, and vehicle services, should be closely organized to advance and retreat with the military, to avoid being forced or used by the enemy. Those who are still driving vehicles on occupied railways, such as the various railways outside the Guanwai in the past, the pseudo-Fengshan Railway, and the current Beining Railway, are mostly former employees who continue to serve, giving the enemy great convenience. The majority of this responsibility should be borne by the past road administration authorities, because a group of middle and lower-level employees cannot retreat to the rear, and after staying in the local area, they are either threatened by force or oppressed by life, so they have to endure the pain and continue to serve on the original line. Is this their wish? A small number of those who escaped from the enemy's forces to the rear were not provided with accommodation by the road administration authorities, causing them to be displaced. This is tantamount to indirectly promoting employees to remain on the original line to serve the enemy. Therefore, in the future, employees on each railway line in the military zone should be militarized and closely organized to increase the effectiveness of military transportation when advancing and to make an orderly retreat when retreating. Even if the enemy occupies our railway line, it will not be easy to restore traffic for a while. At a minimum, this should be done for technical employees.</p>
<p>③ A railway demolition and repair worker team should be organized immediately, adopting military training, so that they can engage in railway demolition and repair. Before retreating, if it is estimated that a counterattack is impossible, the rails and bridges should be thoroughly destroyed in the quickest way possible. When advancing, they should also be able to repair the rails and bridges in the shortest possible time to facilitate military transport. The destruction of the enemy's rear transportation should be the responsibility of the guerrillas in the army, but railway personnel should be taught demolition techniques and provided with the necessary tools. In this incident, we did not do serious demolition work on the rails and bridges of the Beining Railway, we were not able to withdraw the vehicles of the Beining Railway to the south, and we did not make a planned retreat for the employees of the Beining Railway, so in a few days, it immediately became the enemy's main route for transporting troops, grain, and weapons. This kind of mistake should never be repeated in the future.</p>

<h3>Japanese Warships and Soldiers Gather in This Port; The Situation is Serious</h3>
<p>Japanese Spies Infiltrate to Probe Our Preparations; Residents in Wusong, Jiangwan, and Other Places Flee in Droves; Frontline Sentries and Plainclothes Units Open Fire to Provoke</p>
<p>According to reliable news this morning, there were no changes in the Japanese military lines last night. However, after 2:00 AM this morning, a small number of frontline infantry units and plainclothes units began to move around east of the Yokohama River and the Qingyun Bridge. They opened fire three or four times around 3:00 AM this morning to provoke, but our side remained calm and did not respond.</p>
<p>After 2:00 AM this morning, our reporter drove to various places bordering the Public Concession and Zhabei for a final inspection. All the iron gates connecting to the Chinese areas were tightly closed, with armed members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps guarding each location. The streetlights in Zhabei, though still as bright as before, illuminated roads completely devoid of people, presenting a desolate scene. It was as if a state of war had already silently descended.</p>
<p>The situation in Shanghai was very tense yesterday. As a result, residents from areas such as Wusong, Zhabei, and Jiangwan packed up their belongings and rushed to move into the concession areas. Cars, rickshaws, and moving trucks were all hired, especially rickshaws. Rickshaw pullers took the opportunity to raise their prices and profit from the situation. Even for a short distance, some were charging more than half a yuan. The frenzy of moving did not subside until late in the evening. At the same time, to maintain order, the concession authorities dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and Western detectives to guard the borders between the Chinese areas and the concessions, so no disturbances occurred.</p>
<p>Around 10:00 PM, because Japanese troops were mobilized in large numbers and many Japanese spies infiltrated our transportation routes and public places to gather information, our side made considerable preparations for self-defense. At the same time, the areas bordering the Public Concession and the Chinese areas were concerned about unexpected incidents or petty criminals causing trouble, so it was announced that all iron gates at the border between the Chinese areas and the concessions would be closed at 8:00 PM that evening. The reporter went to check the area north of Suzhou Creek at 9:50 PM and saw that the iron gates at Kaifeng Road, Qipu Road, Gansu Road, Haining Road, North Zhejiang Road, Avenue Road, Kannan Road, North Shanxi Road, North Henan Road, Bazih Road, and North Sichuan Road were indeed closed. At the same time, the Western troops of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were also ordered to deploy. The Hongkou Police Station also dispatched additional Chinese and Western armed detectives to assist in maintaining order in various places. Trolley cars on Routes 5, 6, and 7 of the Public Concession were all returned to the depot after 9:45 PM. Only Routes 1 and 2, which ran between North Sichuan Road, Bazih Road, Jing'an Temple, and Waiyangjing Bridge Jing'an Temple, continued to operate. In addition, only Route 18 of the trolleybuses, which ran between Yuezhou Road and Xieqiao, did not stop, but the number of vehicles had been reduced, so passengers were very crowded. The shops in the central areas of the British and French concessions remained open, but the shops near the borders between the Chinese areas and the concessions closed early, and some did not open at all.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Xinsheng News Agency reported that Britain, the United States, and France were all preparing to increase their troops in Shanghai. The French army was being transferred from Annam, and 400 soldiers arrived in Shanghai by ship last night. Another 400 were scheduled to arrive next week. The British army and the US Marines were about to depart from Hong Kong and the Philippines, respectively. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps in the Public Concession and the White Russian Regiment in the French Concession had already been deployed last night, guarding the main intersections on the borders of the two concessions. Detectives from the police stations of the two concessions were all dispatched to jointly maintain public security.</p>
<h3>Ten Japanese Warships Sailed Out of Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Their Movements are Mysterious and Unpredictable; Five More Ships Arrived in the Afternoon; Foremen Resign from Work</p>
<p>The Japanese warships that had sailed to Shanghai from Sasebo unloaded a large amount of military supplies and marines in Shanghai the night before. Yesterday morning at 6:00 AM, some Japanese warships sailed out, and more continued to enter. Five Japanese warships entered the port: the destroyer "Ren" at 5:50 AM, two destroyers of the 16th squadron at 10:00 AM, another destroyer of the 16th squadron at 10:10 AM, and the destroyer "Shiretoko" at 1:25 PM. It was reported that there were still nine ships lurking outside the Wusongkou, including an aircraft carrier. However, some also sailed out, and their movements are unknown: the destroyer "Mu" at 6:20 AM, the gunboat "Yae-yama" at 6:25 AM, the destroyer "Hozumi" at 8:50 AM, the destroyer "Hatsuharu" at 1:25 PM, the destroyer "Natori" at 1:45 PM, the destroyer "Hatsukumo," the destroyer "Hatsukumo" at 1:50 PM, the destroyer "Kinu" at 2:10 PM, the cruiser "Yura" at 2:30 PM, and the destroyer "Wakaba" at 2:40 PM, for a total of ten ships that sailed out. According to the Xinsheng News Agency's investigation with the Customs, as of last night, there were a total of eighteen Japanese warships anchored in the Huangpu River, excluding those that sailed out. Also, the destroyer that arrived yesterday was led by the Ren ship, which had sailed out the day before. Finally, a very large transport ship, fully loaded with military supplies and marines, arrived in Shanghai, with the ship name Shiretoko. After these five Japanese warships entered the port, they docked at the NYK and Mitsui wharves. Both wharves are in Pudong, so a large number of armaments and marines were unloaded at the warehouses on the Pudong side.</p>
<p>Japanese warships are constantly arriving in Shanghai and unloading large quantities of military supplies. The aforementioned warships loaded with military supplies are all docked at the Huishan, Osaka, and Huangpu wharves in Hongkou. The unloading of military supplies is all done at night and stored in the warehouses at the three wharves, with Chinese laborers doing the unloading work. A small foreman, Li Yongji (Chinese), has been the general foreman for the small laborers at the Osaka wharf for many years. This time, because he was disturbed by the large amount of military supplies being transported to Shanghai by Japanese warships, poisoning his compatriots, he resigned from his job with the Japanese boss at 9:00 AM on the 11th and led his small laborers away from the wharf. Now, Li Heting, the Chinese compradore of Osaka, has been appointed as the acting general foreman, and he has appointed He Shicai from Dongtai and Wang Changbin from Taizhou as foremen to recruit a general group of Jiangbei laborers to take over the work yesterday morning. At 4:30 AM yesterday morning, a warship docked at the Osaka wharf, and the newly hired workers transported the military supplies from the ship to Warehouse No. 11. According to small laborers at the Huishan wharf, on the 27th of last month, a Japanese warship docked at the wharf, and the small foreman Wu Longji supervised the small laborers in transporting 600 boxes of poison gas bombs from the ship at night, with each box containing six bombs (rectangular, about three or four feet long), which were all stored in Warehouse No. 4 of the Huishan wharf, preparing to release them during the war.</p>
<h3>The Jinghu Passenger Train Stopped Running Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the situation in Shanghai suddenly became tense yesterday, the North Railway Station was also designated as a guarded area. The night express train that departed from Beijing on the Jinghu Railway at 11:00 PM the night before was delayed until yesterday afternoon due to crowded passengers, and it only arrived in Zhenru. All passenger trains, except for the express train, which departed as usual at 8:00 AM, were delayed. The express train at 8:35 AM was delayed until 10:30 AM. After 10:00 AM, all trains were not dispatched. The two railway bureaus also posted notices at the Jielu gate stating, "Passenger tickets for all trains at this station are temporarily suspended." The passenger trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway continued to operate as usual, but passengers had to get on and off at the South Station, and there were occasional delays. The vehicles on the Sihhu Highway and the Hutai Highway were all suspended yesterday. Waterway transportation, such as the Sanbei, Ningshao, China Merchants, and other inland river steamship companies, continued to operate as usual. All passengers traveling to the Yangtze River and Ningbo, Zhenhai, Huzhou, Pinghu, and other inland areas were unusually crowded. A Nanjing dispatch on the 10th reported that four Jinghu trains were dispatched on the 12th, at 7:50 AM, 8:20 AM, 6:00 PM, and 12:40 AM, all to Suzhou. The fast express, special express, and night express were all suspended. The night train from Shanghai to Beijing arrived at 2:00 PM, and the fast express arrived at 8:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Chinese Ships Will Completely Suspend Service Starting Today</h3>
<p>All Ships Sailed Out of Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon; Passenger and Freight Shipments Have Also Been Stopped</p>
<p>The situation in Shanghai was very tense yesterday. The Japanese residents who had evacuated from various places along the Yangtze River had all boarded the ships. Because there was a hurricane at sea, they changed their departure to today and will be sent back to Japan. Yesterday noon, Chinese merchant ships unanimously decided that the Mingxing, Xinming, Xinjiangtian, Ningxing, and other ships that were carrying passengers fleeing to the Yangtze River and Ningbo would all sail out early. The Xinjiangtian and Ningxing ships sailed out at 12:00 PM, and the Mingxing and Xinming ships sailed out of Shanghai at 4:00 PM. The China Merchants Bureau's Haiyuan ship also urgently left Shanghai for Hong Kong at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. All Chinese Jianghai ships in Shanghai had left Shanghai completely yesterday, leaving no ships in Shanghai. Therefore, starting today, the Shanghai Chinese merchant ship companies, whether state-run or civil aviation, will have no ships operating on their original Yangtze River, Nanyang, and other routes, and will be almost completely suspended. Even if one or two ships are operating, they will be temporarily scheduled based on the situation. Also, starting at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, passenger services and customs declaration services on various routes in the Yangtze River and the North and South Seas have stopped accepting passenger and freight shipments. The goods stored in the warehouses that could be moved were moved to safer areas for storage. The inland river ships on the Suzhou River were fully loaded with passengers heading to various places inland. Starting today, all Chinese ships in Shanghai's sea transport will stop sailing. Only the Taikoo and Jardine ships of foreign merchants are still operating, but they are not transporting any freight. They are only providing transportation for passengers fleeing.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Daily Necessities Must Not Be Manipulated or Price Gouged</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Stores to Comply; Violators Will Be Punished by Government According to Law</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a public notice to all stores regarding daily necessities, stating that they must not be manipulated or price gouged: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued an order relaying a telegram from the Ministry of Industry stating, "Considering the current serious situation, regarding the prices of daily necessities in various regions, we are sincerely concerned that unscrupulous people will engage in speculative manipulation, causing abnormal fluctuations in prices. We must take measures to prevent this and ensure the people's livelihood. The bureau is hereby ordered to pay close attention to this, consider the local situation and implement appropriate measures, and report for review." Considering the current serious situation, we have reached an extraordinary period. All daily necessities must not be arbitrarily manipulated or price gouged in order to stabilize the people's livelihood. In addition to the previous report, the Chamber of Commerce is ordered to comply and immediately implement the necessary measures and report back for verification. This is a strict order. At this critical moment, if one engages in hoarding and cornering the market, taking advantage of the danger to profit, it is no different from exploiting the blood and sweat of fellow compatriots to enrich oneself. All merchants in the city should thoroughly and vigorously caution themselves against this. Otherwise, once reported and verified, the Chamber of Commerce will have no choice but to petition the responsible government authorities to punish the violators according to law. This is a public notice.</p>

<h3>Important Speech by Mayor Yu</h3>
<p>Expressing Deep Regret over Japan's Dispatch of Large Numbers of Warships to Shanghai; Sincerely Hope That Citizens Will Remain Calm and Fulfill Their Responsibilities as Citizens</p>
<p>Regarding the recent developments in the situation in Shanghai, Mayor Yu issued the following statement yesterday afternoon: Since the unfortunate incident at Hongqiao Airport occurred, our side decided to investigate with a sincere and impartial attitude in order to seek a resolution through diplomatic channels. However, while the Japanese side stated that they would await the investigation and agreed to a diplomatic solution, they also dispatched large numbers of warships to Shanghai and landed many troops, which is close to a threat, and is deeply regrettable. The residents of the city are unsettled, and seeing this situation, they naturally feel uneasy. Moreover, with rumors flying and widespread speculation, people are becoming increasingly panicked. As the mayor, I sincerely hope that all citizens will do their best to remain calm, fulfill their responsibilities as citizens, and exhibit their inherent conscience. Do not panic or cause disturbances. Be united and trust the government, calmly await the development of the situation, and jointly seek a way to resolve the national crisis. Those who spread rumors and disrupt public order will be dealt with according to the law and will not be tolerated.</p>
<h3>Ceasefire Agreement Joint Committee Held Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Responding to a Request from the Japanese Side, They Demanded That Our Side Withdraw Troops; Mayor Yu Sternly Refuted This; The Meeting Was Fruitless</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement Joint Committee convened a meeting at the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting hall at 3 PM yesterday, responding to a request from the Japanese side. Participants included Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun, the representative from our side, and Consul General Okamoto, the representative from the Japanese side, as well as representatives from the four countries of England, France, America, and Italy.</p>
<p>Okamoto First Addressed the Meeting; First, the Japanese representative Okamoto addressed the meeting, saying that the Chinese representative had informed him yesterday that the security forces near the Japanese residential area had retreated, but this morning, the security forces and regular troops had set up defensive fortifications in the suburbs. This action violated the ceasefire agreement and the Joint Committee should pay attention to it and take effective measures to stop it.</p>
<p>Mayor Yu Sternly Refuted This; After Okamoto finished speaking, Mayor Yu refuted his speech with a stern attitude and words, saying, "After hearing the words of the Japanese representative, I deeply feel that the Japanese representative believes that the Joint Committee was established solely to satisfy the demands of the Japanese side. This kind of thinking is completely wrong. The purpose of establishing the Joint Committee is to maintain peace and order in Shanghai, not to assist the Japanese government in implementing its policy of aggression. The Japanese representative is using the representatives of neutral countries as his tools, utilizing them when needed and discarding them when not needed. Is this not extremely wrong? I say this with reason. Last year, the Japanese troops invaded the Baziqiao area. According to the provisions of the ceasefire agreement, the Japanese troops should have withdrawn from that area. Therefore, the ceasefire agreement has long been destroyed by the Japanese troops' act of bad faith. It should be known that the ceasefire agreement is only effective if both parties abide by it. If only one party abides by it, it will not help in practice. Now that the ceasefire agreement has already been torn apart by the Japanese side's violation, the Chinese representative believes that the Japanese side has no basis to make any further proposals based on the agreement. This is the first point that should be noted. Secondly, after the unfortunate incident at Hongqiao, the Japanese side repeatedly stated that it would await the investigation of the facts and resolve the matter through diplomatic channels. However, on one hand, warships were gathering, troops were greatly increased, and military supplies were also replenished in large quantities. In addition, a large number of warships are on their way, continuously arriving. These measures not only endanger the safety of foreign nationals in Shanghai, but also pose a threat to China, and are sufficient to cause harmful actions. China, in its own territory, naturally has the right to take self-defense actions. I did indeed inform the Japanese representative yesterday that our security forces had retreated slightly from the area near the Japanese residential area. This was an announcement made in my capacity as mayor. At that time, I also protested to the Japanese representative about the gathering of Japanese warships and troops in Shanghai. The Japanese representative at that time replied that he did not know about the increase in Japanese troops. However, not long after, I verified that Japanese warships and troops had indeed increased significantly. Therefore, for the sake of defense, the security forces naturally cannot withdraw. In short, our side adheres to the consistent policy of 'We will not offend others unless they offend us,' which has been established by the central government. We will continue to protect foreign nationals residing in Shanghai and respect the interests of foreign nationals as usual. Please convey this to the foreign nationals."</p>
<p>The Meeting Ended Fruitlessly; At this point, the representatives of various countries suggested whether the security forces could be slightly withdrawn to avoid conflict. Mayor Yu immediately replied that the ceasefire agreement had already been destroyed by the Japanese side, so there was no need to convene the Joint Committee today. However, the representatives of various countries are acting as mediators in their capacity as consuls, and I am also very willing to discuss the matter. However, our troops have absolute freedom of action on our own land, and this does not allow others to interfere. For the sake of maintaining peace and security in Shanghai, if Japan withdraws the increased warships and troops, then our side is willing to consider withdrawing the security forces. The Japanese representative did not give a concrete answer on this point. Therefore, the meeting was fruitless. However, both representatives stated that they would make every effort to avoid the outbreak of hostilities. The meeting adjourned at 5:15 PM.</p>
<h3>Municipal Party and Government Agencies Unite to Organize National Salvation Work Groups</h3>
<p>Over 140 National Salvation Groups; Disorganized Organization Should Be Merged and Eliminated</p>
<p>Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the tragic fall of Beiping and Tianjin, anti-enemy groups in the city have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. In addition to the general organization of the Municipal All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, and groups such as the labor, peasant, and cultural groups establishing separate National Salvation Associations to assist the work of the Anti-Enemy Support Association, according to investigations, there are already over 140 other scattered national salvation groups. After consultations between the municipal party and government agencies, all agree that the national salvation work of various groups demonstrates the people's patriotic enthusiasm, which is commendable. However, they are concerned that there are too many groups and the organization is disorganized. They are sincerely concerned that unscrupulous people, or traitors, may use the name of resisting the enemy to secretly provide aid to the enemy. In order to eliminate abuses, concentrate strength, and improve anti-enemy efficiency, they have sent personnel to conduct detailed investigations and have drafted plans to unify national salvation work, merge groups with similar characteristics, and resolutely eliminate bad groups.</p>

<h3>Wang Xiaolai Broadcasts a Speech: All Citizens Should Defend Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, delivered a speech on the China-West Radio last night, calling on all citizens of Shanghai to defend Shanghai with all their strength. He said, "Fellow citizens, we have truly reached the final moment. Everyone should just bury their heads in work. Those with strength should contribute their strength, and those with money should contribute their money. I feel that for the sake of the country, shedding blood, sweating, donating money, and donating goods are all the most glorious and valuable actions. We all do not want to be slaves and do not want to be traitors. Everyone feels the same way, so what else is there to say? I believe that the central government's attitude of resisting the enemy has now been clearly demonstrated, and they are preparing to take on the responsibility of defending our territory. Then, we Shanghai people, who live here, eat here, and raise our children here, should of course all rise up to defend this place to the best of our ability for the sake of the country and for the sake of ourselves. Now, all the banks, money houses, and newspapers are collecting national salvation donations. I predict that tomorrow morning, many patriotic compatriots will definitely be waiting at the doors of banks, money houses, and newspapers to enthusiastically contribute donations to save the country's life, to save the nation's life, and also to save their own lives and save the lives of their children and grandchildren. If everyone does this, every family does this, then not only can Shanghai be defended, but the Chinese nation will definitely be revived. Based on the principle that every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the country, I believe that my patriotism will not lag behind others, and others' patriotism will also definitely not lag behind me. I hope that everyone will not slack off in the responsibilities that they should fulfill in their positions, and will not retreat. With utmost sincerity and single-mindedness, the country can be saved. I also hope that patriotic compatriots will not easily believe the rumors deliberately created by traitors, who are trying to confuse public opinion and discredit the reputation of organizations. I have lived in Shanghai for over thirty years, and my actions have been clear to everyone. Whenever rumors abound, I just laugh them off, believing that they are not worth debating. I urge all Shanghai compatriots to use their full strength to defend Shanghai at this time of life and death, and do not relax or delay and ruin yourselves. Shanghai will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate!"</p>
<h3>Rescue Organization Already Has Some Progress</h3>

<p>Women's Rescue Training Continues to Open Classes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's National Defense Association, in view of the current severe stage of the situation, has intensified the training of rescue personnel and is teaching air defense knowledge.

<h3>Japanese Official Hidak Talks About the Hongqiao Incident; Vice Minister Responds</h3>
<p>British Ambassador Advised Peace; Our Side Still Holds to Original Intention</p>
<p>Nanjing, 12th - Japanese Embassy Counselor Hidaka Shinrokuro went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3:30 PM on the 12th to meet with Vice Minister Chen Jie to convey Mr. Kawagoe's views on resolving the Shanghai Hongqiao Incident. The conversation lasted for one hour. When Mr. Hidaka met with Mr. Chen, he reiterated the points discussed by Shanghai Consul Okamoto and Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun on the 11th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that both sides agreed to negotiate on the spot in Shanghai, and the minister did not express any specific views. British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen visited Vice Minister of Political Affairs Xu Mo at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4 PM to express concern about the Hongqiao Incident and inquired about the situation. He spoke about the situation of the case as heard by the British side and objectively mentioned the consuls' corps' advice for both sides to seek peace. Mr. Xu replied that our side still holds to the original intention of resolving the matter through diplomatic channels, which is the same as the expectations of foreign residents in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Citizens' Associations in Various Districts Petition for Severe Punishment of Traitors</h3>
<p>Citizens' associations from various districts of this city presented a petition to the Municipal Government and Garrison Headquarters yesterday morning. The petition stated: "The Japanese invaders are intensifying their aggression, with their intention to destroy our nation and exterminate our race becoming increasingly evident. All who possess a sense of honor and patriotism are filled with grief and indignation, willing to sacrifice everything to fight the enemy. However, some unpatriotic citizens are willing to act as traitors, either spying on military intelligence for the enemy or providing them with grain, provisions, and military supplies. The harm they inflict on the nation and the danger they pose to the lives of our people are even greater than the enemy's aggression. If they are not punished according to the law, how can we uphold law and order? This city, being a commercial port and the financial center of the nation, is also at the forefront of national defense. Allowing traitors to lurk here would have a tremendous impact. Therefore, our associations, in a joint meeting, have resolved that traitors harm the nation. In addition to our associations instructing our respective district branches to strictly investigate and prevent such activities, we request that the police authorities severely punish them according to the law for the crime of endangering the nation, in order to serve as a warning. We respectfully submit this petition based on our resolution, and we earnestly request that your esteemed government (department) consider and implement it to maintain order." Presented by the Citizens' Association of the First Special District, the Citizens' Association of the First Special District, the Citizens' Association of the Hu Nan District, and the Citizens' Association of the Hu Bei District.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Issues Instructions Regarding Filing Procedures for Merchant Associations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government received a communication from the Ministry of Industry yesterday regarding the matter of merchant associations submitting filings for registration. It stated that due to incomplete procedures or non-compliant regulations, the process of investigation, verification, and correction often takes a considerable amount of time. In order to streamline the filing process, the Ministry has formulated instructions regarding the filing procedures for merchant associations and requests that they be circulated for compliance. The Municipal Government has already instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to circulate these instructions for compliance. The original text of the aforementioned instructions is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ All charters and lists submitted by merchant associations for registration should comply with the amended guidelines for the articles of association of chambers of commerce and industrial associations issued by the Executive Yuan, as well as the format of their lists. Unless there are special circumstances, no additions or deletions should be made lightly. ㊀ The organization, establishment, reorganization, restructuring, and re-election of merchant associations should all be noted with the date in the submitted documents. ㊀ After the election or replacement of committee members, it must be reported within fifteen days. ㊀ For organizations that are being established, the permit number from the Party Headquarters should be noted. For organizations that are being reorganized or restructured, it should be stated that the reorganization has been approved by the Party Headquarters and the competent government agency. ㊀ If a merchant association has been reorganized or restructured in the past, the registration should start from the date of the reorganization or restructuring. Previous lists do not need to be resubmitted. ㊀ When reporting a re-election, if any committee members from the previous term have resigned or been replaced, but the report was not submitted due to special circumstances, it should be explained in detail in the submission to avoid discrepancies. ㊀ When reporting a re-election, if there are no changes from the previous term, it is not necessary to resubmit the charter. ㊀ The original list of committee members at the time of organization was called the "First Term." To avoid confusion with the "First Re-election" and "Second Re-election" during re-elections, the term "Term" should be omitted, and it should be directly called "List of Committee Members Elected at the Time of Establishment." Subsequently, it should be called "List of Committee Members Elected at the Time of the First Re-election," "List of Committee Members Elected at the Time of the Second Re-election," and so on. If it has been reorganized with the permission of the Party Headquarters, it should be called "List of Committee Members Elected After Reorganization." If it has been restructured with the approval of the local competent government agency and the local Party Headquarters, it should be called "List of Committee Members Elected After Restructuring." The date of election should be noted on each list. ㊁ For the current term of elected member representatives, all names should be listed sequentially before the membership list. If it is not possible to list them before the membership list of the chamber of commerce, the words "Elected Committee Member of the Current Term" should be noted under the name of the representative for easy verification. ㊀ When re-electing, the words "Retained" or "Newly Elected" should be added to the lower right of each committee member's name on the list of committee members. ㊀ In the format of the list of committee members of the trade association, the "Type of Business" column should be filled in with the industry specified in the name of the association. ㊁ The representatives appointed by the members of the trade association are limited to "managers" or "principals." If the number of employees in a store is between eleven and twenty, one additional employee representative should be appointed. For those with twenty-one to thirty employees, two should be appointed, and for those with more than thirty-one, three should be appointed. The number of employee representatives is limited to three. The "Position in Store" column should only note "Manager," "Principal," or "Employee," and no other names should be used (such as director, assistant, accountant, partner, etc.) to avoid ambiguity.</p>
<h3>Sufficient Supply of Rice and Wheat in the City</h3>
<p>According to the "Shen Shi" News Agency, the Coarse Grains and Rice Industry Association has established a Sales Committee. In light of the tense war situation and the impending outbreak of full-scale resistance, the supply of rice and grain in the city is crucial to the people's livelihood. To avoid a last-minute scramble, the Association has been conducting a thorough survey of the city's rice reserves. It has been learned that the Association has already registered the amount of rice stored in various merchants' stores, which amounts to 400,000 shi as of recently. The supply is sufficient, and the people of the city need not worry about their food.</p>
<p>According to the "Da Gong" News Agency, since the Ministry of Finance issued an order prohibiting the export of wheat and the transshipment of flour out of the province, most of the flour mills in the city have reduced production or ceased operations. The sales of wheat have also been affected. Currently, the total amount of wheat stored in various warehouses in the city is approximately 440,000 dan. The number of foreign wheat stored in various flour mills is also considerable. As for the wheat reserves in the wheat-producing areas in various inland provinces, they are quite substantial. Although international transactions are still possible, they are subject to various procedural restrictions, which greatly delay transportation. In addition, the hot weather makes it easy for red spots to appear on the wheat during transportation by boat and vehicle, which reduces the gluten content of the flour.</p>
<h3>National Goods Factories Association Requests Banks and Money Shops to Continue Lending</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories Association, in view of the fact that commercial banks and money shops in Shanghai are mostly tightening their lending, refusing to pay out to manufacturers with existing overdrafts, and even only accepting deposits but not making payments, and after receiving remittances from other places, deducting them from overdrafts and completely stopping mortgage loans, believes that if this continues, various factories will inevitably stop production due to lack of capital turnover, resulting in the unemployment of hundreds of thousands of workers, which will have a huge impact. Therefore, yesterday, it submitted a petition to the Ministries of Finance and Industry, ordering the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, as well as the Shanghai Banking and Money Shops Association, to organize a wartime economic committee, establish fundamental measures for the wartime economy, lead the industry and banks, and order them to continue lending to maintain the original overdraft amounts of various accounts, so that factories can operate and avoid bankruptcy.</p>

The regulations stipulate that all unemployed chauffeurs and automobile repair mechanics who have obtained licenses in this city can register in order to find employment. Unemployed automobile drivers can register at the Driver Examination Office of the Public Utilities Bureau at Fenglin Bridge.

<h3>Relief Work Suddenly Becomes Tense Amidst Serious Situation</h3>
<p>Relief Society Has Already Transported Thousands of Refugees Lake Society and Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association Begin to Take in Refugees</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in this city suddenly became serious. Refugees fled from the Wusong River, Jiangwan, Dachang, and Zhabei areas. Various relief agencies, various sectors, and various groups in this city rose up to engage in relief work and were responsible for working all night. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Relief Committee</p>
<p>Yesterday, refugees fled from the Wusong River, Jiangwan, Dachang, and Zhabei areas. The Relief Committee of this city, from 9:00 a.m. to the evening, dispatched five large trucks from the reception team to transport more than 2,000 refugees to Renji Hall on Yunnan Road for centralized registration in batches. Then, they were sent to various shelters for temporary accommodation. More than 20 shelters have been designated throughout the city. Each shelter accommodates between 60-70 and over 100 people. The committee has assigned administrators to assist the supply team in handling food and other supplies. The work is extremely tense. All members of each team worked all night. Because there are still a large number of refugees who have not been transported out, they are scheduled to continue to depart at 4:00 a.m. this morning to continue the transport. After being sent to various shelters for temporary accommodation, they will be sent back to their hometowns in batches by the repatriation team at any time. The committee has also found the Great World, Guang'en Temple, Buddhist Pure Land Society, Qingliang Temple, Jiangning Guild Hall and other places for accommodation. As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, more than 500 refugees had registered. It has been decided that each shelter will provide two meals a day.

The fellow villagers associations of the three counties in Shanghai held a joint meeting at 304 Pudong Building on Pudong Avenue at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss relief matters. More than 50 people, including Jin Jushan, attended the meeting and decided to establish a Refugee Relief Association of Taijiabao Three Counties, and elected Zhang Gongquan as the chairman.

Representatives of charity organizations, including Wang Yiting, and other fifty people attended. Qu Wenliu chaired the meeting. After the meeting, the chairman first reported on the situation of refugees flocking into the concession to avoid the war. Then, they discussed how to provide relief and accommodation, and decided as follows: (1) Each charity organization should allocate a considerable number of houses to accommodate as many refugees as possible. (2) Allocate funds separately to prepare various supplies for accommodating refugees. (3) Negotiate with various hometown associations to assist in sending them back to their hometowns.</p>
<p>World Red Swastika Society</p>
<p>After the World Red Swastika Society established the Southeast Joint Relief General Management Department of the World Red Swastika Society in Shanghai, it is actively preparing to set up temporary hospitals and shelters for emergency needs. The department sent a letter to the Shanghai Charity Associations Federation for Disaster Relief yesterday, requesting assistance. The letter stated that if the disaster of war unfortunately breaks out, our relief team can set out to provide relief.</p>

<h3>Garrison Headquarters Executes Six Traitors Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>All Confessed to Being Directed by the Enemy to Spy on Military Intelligence and Sabotage the Rear</p>
<p>Since the North China Incident occurred, the enemy has been buying Chinese people to serve as traitors, mixing in various places to spy on military intelligence and take on the work of disrupting the rear, or supplying the enemy with various military supplies. These traitors willingly accept the enemy's instructions and are scattered in various districts of Shanghai. The police authorities of this city have arrested many traitors in recent days and sent them to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for investigation. Among them, Ji Bohua, Zhou Miaogen, Huang Xunnian, Zhao A'er, Liu Baorong, Liu Zhenxue and other six people, after several interrogations by the military law office, all confessed to being hired by the Japanese side, with a monthly subsidy of 16 to 20 yuan. They were specifically responsible for spying on military intelligence and sabotaging the rear. It has been confirmed that the facts are true. They were executed by the headquarters yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>A Tour of Zhabei Under Wartime Conditions</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese bandits occupied Tianjin and Beijing, their navy stationed in Shanghai has also been eager to try. They land and parade every day to demonstrate their power. The merchants and residents of North Shanghai were originally startled birds and feared that the tragedy of the January 28th Incident would be staged again. Therefore, those who were slightly wealthy moved in advance to avoid the fierce flames. When the situation seemed to ease slightly the week before, and the authorities indicated that there was no need to worry about public order, the trend of relocation was slightly curbed. Unexpectedly, the Hongqiao Airport Incident suddenly occurred a few days ago. The Japanese side actually assembled 28 warships in Shanghai waters and made unreasonable demands on our municipal government, hoping to achieve their goal of threatening our side to submit, which caused the situation to suddenly become serious. The entire Zhabei has completely entered a wartime state. The residents in the area and the neighboring areas of Kun all moved to avoid the war. From morning to night, they never stopped. The number of stores that temporarily closed down was countless. The Hongkou, Huishi, and Diswei Road police stations all increased the police force at the junction with the Chinese territory to maintain the security of the Public Concession. The various situations are described as follows:</p>
<p>Relocation</p>
<p>Starting yesterday morning, all those who lived in the Zhabei area and in the Kun neighboring Zhabei moved to the south of Suzhou River. The roads from north to south were almost occupied by handcarts, cars, collapsed carts, rickshaws, and pedicabs. The most crowded places were North Zhejiang Road, Fujian Road, North Henan Road, and North Xizang Road. Among them, poor families who could not afford to hire a car carried things on their shoulders, carried them on poles, or carried them in their hands. There were also those who were carrying babies and running away in a hurry. The tragic situation of being displaced was even worse than the January 28th Incident. The most crowded times were 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. In these two times, all kinds of small vehicles were connected from the old garbage bridge to the boundary road, and there was no room for insertion. By 7:00 p.m., it was still not sparse. Therefore, after yesterday's thorough movement in the North District, the remaining population was indeed very small.</p>
<p>Closing of Markets</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, there was only relocation in the North District, and there was no other action. By noon, the stores near the station automatically closed down one after another, and soon spread to North Zhejiang Road, Aierjin Road, Haining Road, North Shanxi Road, North Henan Road, Laobazi Road, North Sichuan Road, and other places. By the afternoon, the number of stores closing down on the various roads increased with time. After dusk, there were even completely closed and no one was open.</p>
<p>Police Force</p>
<p>Yesterday noon, the Hongkou, Huishi, and Diswei Road police stations increased the number of Chinese, Western, Indian, and Japanese detectives to guard each section of the junction between the North District of the Public Concession and the Chinese territory. The minimum number of guards was two per post, and the maximum was four, six, and eight. In addition to patrol detectives, they shuttled back and forth. If there were idle people gathering, they were immediately persuaded to disperse. The police force at the boundary road opposite the North Station and the intersection of Baoshan Road on North Henan Road was the strictest. All the iron gates installed at the boundary had been repaired and perfected. Each iron gate was specially assigned a main detective to manage the opening and closing in case of emergency. It was said that the several iron gates at the intersection of Baoshan Road on North Henan Road, the intersection of North Shanxi Road and the boundary road, and the intersection of the target road connecting the Chinese territory were going to be closed first at 7:00 p.m. As for the bunkers built by the Public Works Department in the past at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road on Haining Road and the target road, etc., they have now been arranged in them. However, so far, there have been no troops stationed in the bunkers. The barbed wire that is indispensable in every accident has not yet been arranged at the junction of the Chinese and Concession territories during the day, but by the evening, workers have already loaded this protective material with collapsed carts and transported it to the northwest area. If the situation is critical, it should be used to block traffic at any time.</p>
<p>Traffic</p>
<p>The north of Shanghai was disturbed all day yesterday. Pedestrians on the roads were like shuttles, but the order was not chaotic. It was indeed the detectives who did their best to maintain it, and fortunately the trams were not obstructed. However, after 7:00 p.m., the No. 6 and Yuan Road trams going north only went to the First Special Court on North Zhejiang Road, and then had to turn around. All the sections of North Station and Shenjiahong were temporarily suspended. The No. 5 and 7 trams also changed to turning around in front of the court on North Zhejiang Road after 7:00 p.m. Therefore, the traffic between various places and the North Station at night was completely cut off, which was very inconvenient for those who wanted to go to the North Station area.</p>
<h3>French Concession Strictly Maintains Law and Order</h3>
<p>The French Concession authorities, in order to maintain the peace of mind of the expatriates and Chinese residents, merchants, etc. in the concession, have installed iron gates at the junction of the Chinese and French sides on the south side. Recently, a solid wall is being built along Xujiahui Road from Xieqiao to the banks of the Rihui Port, hiring workers to build a solid wall for protection. In addition, due to the recent extreme tension in the situation, residents from the Chinese territories in the north and south cities have moved to the concession one after another, fearing that there may be deficiencies in the defense in the event of an accident. Therefore, the French Public Works Bureau has spent money to purchase a large number of wood and barbed wire materials, hired workers to make barbed wire frames, and piled them up in the open space in front of and behind various police stations, in order to be placed at the various important passes along the border of the concession in case of emergency to protect the peace of mind in the concession.</p>
<h3>The "Do Not Buy and Sell Smuggled Goods" Association Actively Promotes Association Affairs</h3>
<p>Sends Letters to Various Organizations to Raise Funds</p>
<p>The "Do Not Buy and Sell Smuggled Goods" Movement Committee, in order to arouse all sectors of society not to buy or sell smuggled goods in times of emergency, prevent the invasion of violent enemies, and harm the national economy, has been actively promoting association affairs and sparing no effort. It has been learned that the administrative expenses of the association are now being informed by the letters to various trade associations, and various organizations and institutions are separately responsible. The official letter said, "Respectfully, all sectors of the city are heartbroken by the rampant smuggling, which endangers the national economy. Therefore, on May 24, a joint meeting was held to announce the establishment of this association and to elect Wang Xiaolai and others to be responsible for carrying out association affairs. In the past two months, the handling of propaganda and swearing-in work has aroused the deep attention of the Chinese people. Now, the violent enemy is invading, and the more intense. The affairs of this association should continue to be promoted, but the administrative expenses are urgently needed to be raised. Therefore, it was decided by the entire committee of this association to send a letter to various organizations in this city, each responsible for 10 to 50 yuan, in order to contribute to it. The records are kept in the volume, and we have always admired your association for your enthusiasm for patriotism, and you have a long-standing sympathy for stopping smuggled goods. Therefore, we have specially recorded the case and sent it to you. We respectfully ask you to take on the responsibility, so as to facilitate the progress of association affairs."</p>
<h3>Problem of Attorney's Application Fees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association, because the Shanghai Two Special Zone Courts have been charging attorneys for application fees, while the Shanghai District Court is still charging them, feels very ambiguous. In addition to requesting that the fee be waived, it has now received the instruction from the court, saying, "The case was previously reported by the association, requesting that the application fee for engaging attorneys be waived. At that time, the court forwarded it to the Jiangsu High Court for verification and instructions. Now, it is opened in the instruction No. 1049 of the Jiangsu High Court: 'Reported, checked the instruction No. 455 of the Judicial Yuan, and sent the ministry order to the court. It has already stated the current handling situation, and please check and instruct to follow. Before the Ministry's reply, all litigation costs charged shall still be handled as before. You should know this order.' etc., so you should know this order."</p>
<h3>Another Typhoon Will Hit Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Another typhoon that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, its wind force is no less than the one that hit Shanghai a few days ago. The typhoon has blown over Taiwan. According to the report of the Municipal Observatory at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the typhoon has blown over 25 degrees north latitude and 116 degrees east longitude. The wind direction is northwest and the wind force is 60 knots. If the wind direction does not change, the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are at risk of suffering this typhoon disaster.</p>
<h3>Robbery at Zhu Guanghan's Home</h3>
<p>Zhu Guanghan, a wealthy gentry from Songjiang living in Shanghai at No. 4 Fenyangfang, at the intersection of Shengmuyuan and Aidaoya Road in the French Concession, was suddenly visited by five robbers at 1:10 p.m. yesterday. Two robbers held guns and guarded the front and back doors, while three robbers rushed in with weapons, locked Zhu's family servant in a room, and threatened them to make no noise. They went upstairs to search and rob. When the robbers entered the door, Zhu's maid found out and sneaked out to report to the French police station. The police station sent Chinese and Western detectives in a police car to pursue and arrest them. The robbers had noticed it and had already fled far away. The loss of Zhu's family at that time is still to be checked and reported. It is said that Zhu was involved in a case a few years ago for a long time, and he hired lawyer Xu Wufang to appeal to the Supreme Court, which was overturned this spring. But misfortunes never come singly. One wave has just subsided, and another wave rises. He was robbed today, which is really unfortunate.</p>
<h3>Suspect in Kidnapping Case Attempts Suicide But Fails</h3>
<p>Head Injured Sent to Hospital for Treatment</p>
<p>Shang Wu, the chief detective of the Huishi Police Station, and Wang Youshan, the detective, arrested a suspect named Lu Zude from Nanjing on Tiantong Road the day before yesterday afternoon. Then, he went to No. 109 Fengle Lane, Baolean Road, with the detectives of the police station, and continued to arrest two accomplices, Zhuang A'er from Suzhou and a woman named Sun Xiaomei. Ten pawn tickets were seized and brought back to the police station. It was found that the suspects were suspected of being involved in kidnapping and robbery cases in the concession, and they were ordered to be detained separately. Unexpectedly, this morning, the suspect Chen Zude suddenly bumped his head on the iron bar in the police station detention center, intending to commit suicide. The patrol police in the detention center found out and tried their best to stop him, but his head was already bleeding. Then, at about 9:00 a.m. yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Wang Yuetang, the lawyer of the police station, stated that the three suspects were related to the kidnapping case and requested that they be detained to continue the investigation. And Chen Zude, because he tried to commit suicide and was injured in the head, should be sent to the hospital. After Judge Fu Lin briefly interrogated Chen and other three people, he ordered that they be detained for seven days for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Two Gun Cases, Robbers Sentenced Separately</h3>
<p>One Robber Sentenced to Six Years, Two Robbers Sentenced to Five Years Each</p>
<p>The homes of Wang Yunhai at 30 East Broadway Road and Fan Chenshi at 357 Zhaofeng Road were invaded by a large group of robbers between 1:40 AM on July 26th and 3:30 AM on August 1st. The robbers brandished pistols to silence any protests, seizing clothing, jewelry, and cash worth 610 yuan before fleeing. Detectives Xu Decheng and Shen Binkui of the Huishan Police Station apprehended the suspects, Ningbo natives Wu Shijin, Jin Binghua, and Jin Muyan, at 310 Tangshan Road and handed them over to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that the ringleader, A Mao, and other accomplices could not be apprehended and were released. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie Fen presided over the Third Criminal Court, examined the three defendants, and sentenced Wu Shijin to six years in prison, and Jin Binghua and Jin Muyan to five years each.</p>
<h3>Xietu Road Bloodshed</h3>
<p>Quarrel Led to Three Stabbed</p>
<p>Qi Lao Er, a native of Gaoyou residing on Xietu Road in the southern triangle of Xujiahui in western Shanghai, worked as a small carpenter. His younger brother, Lao San, was a gangster type. The two brothers were known for their ferocity. This incident stemmed from Zhang Hongyuan, a tailor from Changshu residing at 3161 Xietu Road, who had borrowed one yuan from Qi's mother, agreeing to pay four jiao in monthly interest. He had paid one month's interest, but due to the current situation and slow business, Qi's mother feared Zhang would move, so she repeatedly demanded repayment, even trying to take his clothes. This led to a dispute, during which Qi Lao San grabbed Zhang and beat him severely, causing injuries. Afterwards, the neighbor, Gu Longqing, owner of the Changle Tea Garden, mediated and paid off Zhang's debt on his behalf, urging Qi to apologize to Zhang to resolve the matter. However, Qi refused, and the matter was left unresolved. Last night at 8 PM, the Qi brothers, armed with sharp blades, went to Gu's residence to cause trouble. After a brief argument, they brandished their blades and stabbed wildly, wounding Gu's right arm and ribs in six places. Gu Jin Gen was stabbed three times in the buttocks, and Gu Bingfu was stabbed four times in the abdomen, injuring his internal organs and endangering his life. Upon hearing the commotion, Police Chief Chen Guangrun of the local police station immediately led officers to the scene, where they saw the two murderers covered in blood, running towards them and shouting for help. They were immediately arrested and taken to the station, while the injured were sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Gu Bingfu's condition was so severe that he was transferred to Zhongshan Hospital for further treatment, while the other two were treated and released. The two murderers were handed over to the court today for interrogation.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Why Not Stand Firm!</h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>The atmosphere in Shanghai suddenly became tense due to the arrival of a large number of Japanese warships. Refugees, young and old, who had been fleeing their homes, had begun to settle down somewhat in recent days. Although there was some disturbance on the night of the Hongqiao Airport incident, the decision to resolve the matter through diplomatic channels the next day turned it into a false alarm. Now, however, with the arrival of a large number of Japanese warships, the Japanese attitude has suddenly become stubborn. Consequently, Shanghai residents who had suffered in the January 28th Incident are once again fleeing their homes in a hurried and chaotic manner.</p>
<p>I am not opposed to moving, especially for residents in the Hongkou area, which is currently within the range of Japanese military force. Their relocation is even more understandable because even if they want to do some work to save the nation, they must "keep the green hills" to "not fear running out of firewood." Based on the "January 28th Incident" and the experience of Tianjin, we can imagine the treatment our compatriots will face if Shanghai unfortunately falls into war under Japanese military power!</p>
<p>However, after moving, what will we do? Cry in despair at home? And is moving from Zhabei and Hongkou to the concessions a move to a "safe zone"?</p>
<p>Let's tentatively acknowledge that the central area of the Public Concession and the French Concession are "safe zones." But how should this "safety" be interpreted? If Shanghai's second January 28th Incident does not occur, then naturally, Zhabei will be as "safe" as the concessions. If it does occur, Zhabei may once again become a battlefield. However, on the battlefield, not everyone will necessarily die. If we win, that area will be safer than the concessions. If we are unlucky, then the concessions may not necessarily be a paradise. Not to mention the humiliation and slaughter that the Japanese will inflict on our compatriots, even if we retreat to the "safe zones," I ask: how many months of food and lodging have you prepared? Without food or clothing, can you stay in the so-called "safe zone"?</p>
<p>There is only one path ahead of us: to survive, we must fight to live! Even a dog will jump over a wall when cornered. We are being driven from east to west, are we to be forced to die obediently before the enemy? With the great river in front and pursuing soldiers behind, we have truly reached such a point. If we don't turn around and fight the enemy, we will have to jump into the great river. And you, are you truly so useless that you are willing to jump into the great river?</p>
<p>We have no way to retreat! If we want to live, we must turn around, stand firm, and fight our enemy. Otherwise, you will not survive.</p>
<p>Everyone has already moved out of Zhabei, yes, that is to avoid unnecessary sacrifice. But what are you preparing to do after moving out?</p>
<p>The situation has reached this point, why not stand firm, why not turn around and prepare to fight the enemy? Where do you want to escape to?</p>
<p>We have nowhere to escape, why not stand firm! Reportage Literature Workshop, Zhi Fu</p>

<h3>Factory Street</h3>
<p>— Zhi Fu</p>
<p>We have been running around for three or four days, spreading the word in seven or eight areas, from the beginning until now. To make up for all the shortcomings of the past few days, four enthusiastic young people, still holding onto their iron-willed determination, held a simple discussion again early in the morning of the fifth day as they were about to depart.</p>
<p>We needed to immediately decide where to go today within half an hour: eastward or westward.</p>
<p>But at the meeting, everyone was furrowing their brows and hesitating, silent. After about five minutes of delay, our stubborn and headstrong companion, Shi Min, suddenly stood up and said loudly:</p>
<p>"We should go to the workers' area now! We must do our best to connect every worker's heart and turn them into a strong iron chain!"</p>
<p>That's right. Workers are the most important part of the broad masses in the rear, and we certainly can't forget them! Therefore, his proposal was immediately approved by us. Especially me, to support his proposal, I couldn't help but raise my right arm:</p>
<p>"—Let's adopt this method!"</p>
<p>—However, which area should we go to?… This unresolved question mark hovered anxiously in my heart. Fortunately, another of our companions was quite familiar with the situation in the western district. So, the final destination for today was decided: a factory street on ×× Road (Note). Thus, all eight of our legs began to excitedly alternate, moving forward.</p>
<p>Along the way, the rising sun, like a giant mirror, peeked out from the clouds with golden rays, illuminating us with the same enthusiasm as the sun, accelerating our pace as we walked the road ahead.</p>
<p>However, our faces were serious!…</p>
<p>When we arrived at Factory Street, it was already about 10:15 AM. We chose a spacious corridor nearby. Then, someone in the team skillfully put a roll of newspaper in his hand, marked with the red headline "Baoding Bombed by Japanese Planes", to his mouth as a megaphone. Our loud voice immediately spread in all directions:—</p>
<p>"Brothers! Fellow workers, sisters!..."</p>
<p>—Ah! Ah…</p>
<p>Just as we shouted the first word, a sound of "Ah, ah..." came from every workshop nearby! This sound was simply an excited call, a slave's cry. Immediately, groups of young male and female workers surged like a tide, surrounding us. —They may have been awakened from their dreams; I saw some of them with their hair disheveled or still fastening incomplete buttons…</p>
<p>The noise subsided, and many heads seemed more orderly than before. However, a pale-faced fellow rushed in from the crowd. He raised his bloodless lips and trembled for a while, finally saying tremblingly to us:</p>
<p>"This...this is not allowed to be spoken about here, sir!... Our ×× supervisor just went out... I'm afraid... afraid he'll be back soon. If...if he sees it, things will...will not be a joke!... "</p>
<p>As he spoke, he kept looking around nervously with his sharp eyes. But as he was panicking, some of the male and female workers immediately responded with ferocious smiles:—</p>
<p>"Who's afraid of this ××? You're a traitor, get out of here!"</p>
<p>"Pig! Go away, go lick ××'s ass!"</p>
<p>"Go—get out—"</p>
<p>After everyone drove away the loyal slave, a young woman in her twenties stepped forward and seemed to plead with us:</p>
<p>"Sir! Please speak!—About North China... What are the ×× people doing now...?"</p>
<p>Her sincere expression was like a child who had just learned to walk asking an adult for candy. So, someone eagerly went on to say:</p>
<p>"... Everyone! North China is our Chinese paradise, but now it is being bombarded by the enemy's guns. The two places of Beiping and Tianjin have already fallen. They are mistreating our people everywhere, forcing our Chinese workers to help the ×× army build military defenses... They hit and kill at will. I don't know how many lives have been hurt by them!... Everyone! People's hearts are the same. The enemy is so fierce, can we endure it?—We are going to retaliate now, we are going to..."</p>
<h3>Kick Them Out</h3>
<p>— Jiang Mi</p>
<p>"We must drive the enemy back to where they came from!"</p>
<p>"Not afraid of their planes and cannons..."</p>
<p>"…………………"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a chaotic and powerful roar arose diagonally, completely breaking the dull air of the entire factory street! All that was left was the arms and fists of the workers of the ×× factory, waving in the flying dust. …………</p>
<p>We spoke for more than an hour, thoroughly explaining the obligations that the workers should bear now, and the spirit of unity that is needed. Finally, we moved again to another factory street to continue our unfinished work.</p>
<p>However, the pale-faced guy had not even seen a shadow at this time: He probably understood:—He is also a Chinese after all!</p>
<p>(Note) The large dormitories where factory workers live are collectively referred to as "Factory Street".</p>

<h3>What is Hoped for from National Salvation Leaders</h3>
<p>—A Voice</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the national salvation movement in Shanghai has reached an unprecedented climax. Every day we read the news in Shanghai, and no newspaper fails to devote the largest space to news about the national salvation movement. This is naturally worthy of joy and excitement. But I still have some opinions on the current methods and work of the national salvation movement, and I would like to offer them to the reference of the national salvation activists in Shanghai.</p>
<p>First, today's national salvation movement is clearly too top-heavy. We don't say anything else, just look at the list of directors of various organizations. These are the same people in this organization, and they are still the same people in that organization. It seems that the so-called national salvation work is just a trick played by these few people, which is a very bad phenomenon. It is a completely wrong estimate to say that this phenomenon is a trick played by a few people. Our estimate is: yes, the masses do have very high and very real demands for national salvation, but among the people who have been organized, they cannot produce people who can stand alone for a while, so they have to ask the people who are well-known in the society and have more strength to take on the leadership work. But on the other hand, if these same people are directors in every organization, then the work of every organization cannot be done. It makes every organization a hollow organization. This is extremely dangerous, because if this continues, the organization will disappear without being eliminated.</p>
<p>Second, the members or units in today's various national salvation associations or anti-enemy support associations are too rich in the nature of "guilds." Participation in national salvation work is limited to the principals or responsible persons of various public associations and legal entities, and the members and members of various legal entities do not have the opportunity to directly participate in activities. This method makes it impossible for the real public opinion to reach the top. Various public associations and legal entities only increase the burden on members when executing orders from higher authorities, so that members do not feel an active interest in national salvation work and automatically do the work they are willing to do. Objectively, it may instead depress the morale of the people.</p>
<p>Third, contrary to the above two situations, not enough attention is paid to the organization of the lower-level masses. Some people advocate influencing the lower levels through the upper levels, which is also correct: so I don't say that the work of the upper levels is not desirable, but the work of the upper levels without the foundation of the lower levels will not only not be lasting and stable, but also easily make mistakes. For example, as far as Shanghai is concerned, in this national salvation movement, what arrangements and plans have we made for the workers who work in the enemy's factories? Chinese history is really full of valuable lessons. During the May 30th Movement, several of our patriotic compatriots were killed on Nanjing Road, and several national general strikes came immediately, especially the Guangzhou-Hong Kong strike. The strict organization and the persistence of the struggle made Hong Kong suddenly become a declining commercial port. Now the enemy has killed tens of thousands of our compatriots, taken away our land in several provinces, and even Tianjin and Beijing have been lost. Why don't we accept this valuable lesson of history and expand our economic war? The workers of the Guangzhou-Hong Kong strike were all formed into inspection teams. Why don't we need these workers to arm themselves to defend our motherland now?</p>
<p>Naturally, the above points are only thought of for a while, and I hope that those who are concerned about national salvation work will pay attention to them. If you think it is right, you may wish to use it as a reference! If you think it is wrong, then it is also a point of view of one person among the 400 million people. In a word, we must thoroughly democratize the national salvation movement.</p>

<h3>Defending the Lugou Bridge (5)</h3>
<p>— By Chen He</p>
<p>Then Mr. Wang explained the importance of the Lugou Bridge to them, "I'm telling you, if our Lugou Bridge is taken by the Japanese devils, then Beiping will be finished immediately. The Lugou Bridge is just like Beiping's throat. If a person's throat is strangled, can he still live? If the Lugou Bridge falls into the hands of the Japanese devils, they can connect with Fengtai at any time and surround Beiping at any time. They can cut off the Pinghan Railway and also advance troops to Niangziguan. In that case, our entire China will be ruined."</p>
<p>(At this moment, the sounds of gunfire and artillery never ceased.)</p>
<p>Li Wu couldn't help but sigh, "With such heavy artillery, whoever gets hit is finished! We were really too polite in the past."</p>
<p>The one-legged hero still bravely said, "It's different now. Our 29th Army won't let them be so rampant. Wherever they go, our troops will follow. No matter how rampant the Japanese devils are, we'll give them a taste of our broadswords."</p>
<p>Nearby farmers all gathered around. One asked worriedly, "Doesn't that mean there will be another war?"</p>
<p>"There's no other way. It's not that we want to fight, it's that the Japanese devils are forcing us to." These were Mr. Wang's words.</p>
<p>Liu Debiao also patted his broken thigh and said, "Let's do it! What's there to be afraid of? Let's first beat the Japanese devils into a complete mess!"</p>
