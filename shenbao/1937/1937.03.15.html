<h3>關於綏遠戰爭的日本論調雲南</h3>
<p>（一）開場白</p>
<p>自去歲十一月十五日，內蒙軍以近代的武器—飛行機，坦克車，裝甲車等，進攻綏遠後到現在巳經四個月了。在這四個月中，不知流了多少鮮血，犧牲了多少內蒙和綏遠的將士—這些將士，這些鮮血，誰能說，不都是屬於中華民族的。</p>
<p>因為中日是友邦—而且據說是關係特別密切的友邦，所以自綏戰發生以來，東京就常有關於此問題的言論，在此種言論中，要算是關於內蒙的富源和“內蒙民族”的文字，最為精采也最重要了。</p>
<p>把這些事情，介紹給國人，這是筆者早有此意的；無如問題特殊，難於發言，因此提筆復止，已不知若干次了。但是，問題是不會使關心者忘記的，在本月（二月）二十一日，日本第七十次議會的預算總會上，杉山陸相，關於綏遠問題，就對議員們做了答辯。</p>
<p>為甚麼杉山陸相不在別的會議上說明綏遠問題，而要在預算總會上說明呢？關於這，筆者不能多說。現在筆者能做到的，只有將東京方面發表過的關於綏遠戰爭的文字，擇其重要者略摘數段於後，是是非非，隨讀者自己去加以判斷。</p>
<p>（二）日本言論摘抄</p>
<p>先抄東京第一大報——朝日新聞，在去歲十二月初，所發表的言論。</p>
<p>“蒙古地方，牧畜業，鑛業，採鹽業，及天然曹達業，都很豐富。牧畜業為蒙古人唯一的事業，但現在所用的方法，還很幼稚。從綏遠省豐鎮縣以北至包頭一帶，是羊毛的名產地：輸出額年在八九千萬斤以上。石炭的埋藏量，雖僅佔中國全土埋藏量的百分之○•二，但鐵鑛的埋藏量，却比中國任何地方，都無遜色；僅察哈爾的宣化縣，埋藏量就在九千萬噸以上。內蒙的產鹽額，每年也在數十萬斤左右。天然曹達，察哈爾年產約八千噸，綏遠方而每年也產四千萬担以上。鹽和天然曹達，即內蒙的主要財源。</p>
<p>“察綏兩省，足稱工業的，惟綏遠的皮毛加工工廠。農業雖然十分落後，但依中國的西北開發計畫一九三四年時，着手開墾的水田，已達三百三十萬畝，旱地三千二百萬畝。若果此次的獨立運動成功，在適當的指導和援助下，樹立確固的開發計劃，而且更進而與華北方面的中日經濟提携之進展互相關聯，則內蒙的將來是很可期待的了。”</p>
<p>其次，再抄去歲十一月下旬，讀賣新聞所發表的言論︰</p>
<p>“關於綏東的戰雲，日本有三個不能坐視的理由：第一，綏遠察哈爾是當衝於蘇聯對中國的西方路綫，及重要的北方赤色路綫的地方。第二，“滿洲國”是鄰接內蒙古地帶的，從民族方面說，內蒙種族，是和滿洲國”內的蒙古人為同一種族。現在，此種族正捲入赤化的危險潮流中。第三實現蒙古民族解放，正是日本大陸政策的重要焦點。</p>
<p>够了，摘抄的工作，就至此停止吧。材料太多，要全抄也抄不了。反正大意是差不多的。國人只要細心體會，則這些論調的奧妙處，是不難推想而知的。</p>
<p>（三）尾聲</p>
<p>綏遠戰事，目前雖在停頓着，但前途如何，正成問題。現在三中全會已經閉會了。針對着三中全會的宣言，日本林首相，於本月二十二日曾在議會中發表了如下的言論：</p>
<p>“帝國政府尊重中國的領土主權，希望中國達成行政上的完全統一。但華北是日“滿”支三國的接壤地帶，是三國的政治經濟利害關係最錯綜的地域，關於華北政權之動向，帝國政府，無論何時，都不能不有重大的關心。</p>
<p>同時，杉山陸相關於“滿洲產業五年開發計劃”的概要，也在議會中做了如下的說明：</p>
<p>“……計劃的內容，包含着鑛，工，農，畜產業，交通，及通信各部門，但其主眼，是基于適地適應主義，而振興重要產業：同時，在經濟上，也曾企圖滿洲國”經濟生活的安定。此外，更策劃民族協和，講求使日本人的滿洲移住容易而便利的方法。……！”</p>
<p>關於林首相和陸相的言論，筆者也只能對國人稍盡－點介紹的責任。甚麼批評，甚麼意見，那是仁者見仁，智者見智，中日兩方，各有不同。這裹特別要指出的，只是：“大陸政策”，縫一定不變的。在完成“大陸政策”方針下，言論行動，儘管有今要之差，但骨幹裹的重昔因素，是只有策略上的不同，而沒有內容上的變化的。所以：</p>
<p>過了一山又一山，過了一海又一晦！所謂的“接壤地帶，將是永沒止境的。而且，“民族”的意義和應用，又很廣泛，在中華民族的疆土內，可以分出漢族，蒙族，回旅……等，、但在所謂“東亞盟主，“東亞大同的名義下，却又可大倡甚麼民族恊和”了。但所謂“民族恊和”，究竟是甚麼呢？事實擺在眼前，想來是用不着再解說的了。（二月二十三日）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>新羅迦諾公約問題</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>自從去年三月七日希特勒宣布廢止羅迦諾公約。進兵萊茵河地帶以來。到現在巳經一年有餘了。這一年來。歐洲處於無條約的狀態下。感到了非常的不安定。在西歐方面。有了下列的幾種發展。第一。英國對德曾提出一問題表。詢及希特勒對於廢約後的意向。希氏擱置沒有答復。而後來表現於事實上的答復。則為軍備的無限擴大。與收回殖民地要求的一再提出。第二。比利時突於去年十月十四日。宣布恢復戰前的中立政策。放棄對法的同盟關係。第三。法國感於德國的加甚威脅。巳增築馬其諾陣綫。延長到比利時及瑞士邊境。但是儘管有這種軍事防禦。法國始終不能釋除它對於德國武裝威脅的憂慮。</p>
<p>西歐的不安。為英法同感焦慮的問題。為了這。英國對德的關係。現在巳冷淡許多。而英法在對比對西班牙等問題上。都巳採取一致的態度。不久以前。英外和艾登在議會演說中。聲明英國對於法比受到侵略者的攻擊。仍當根據羅迦諾公約的責任。加以援助。不過在同時。因為德國巳片面廢止這個公約。所以英國又致文德意兩政府。提議訂立一新的羅迦諾公約。</p>
<p>據路透社十三日倫敦電訊。英國的䐑文送出後。經過長久的期待。到十三日巳獲得答復。這答復顯然是經過德意的共同會商而發出的。其中並沒有特殊之點。除了空洞地聲言它們願意共維西歐的安定以外。德國復文所表示具體的兩點。一為維持法德的邊界。由英意共同加以保證。二為德國對於法蘇互助協定。仍不變其反對的態度。</p>
<p>就德意復文的態度看來。這個新的西歐羅迦諾公約的訂立。目前仍是希望渺茫。不易實現。德意自從去年締結協定以來。對於羅迦諾公約問題。即已採取一致強硬的態度。這是第一重困難。第二。萊茵河非武裝地帶業巳取消。德法邊境已回復到歐戰前武裝相對之勢。這時候德國僅以一句空言保證邊界的維持。正與戰前德國的保證比國中立。同樣不可靠的。第三。德國的反對法蘇協定。本為廢止羅迦諾恊定的一種藉口。但自從德意及德日同盟恊定成立以來。這幾個國家的反蘇聯態度。巳比前更趨強烈。然而在同時。蘇聯自從加入國聯。表示擁護歐洲的集體安全制度以來。英蘇的關係。已大有增進。去秋艾登演說。且聲言英國今後對於歐洲外交。决不能把蘇聯除外。那麼德意對於新羅迦諾公約的締結。繼續堅持其反對法蘇恊定的態度。當然也是一個大困難。</p>
<p>這種種困難。不但表示在目前英國所希望的西歐公約的不易實現。而且也表示歐洲整個的局勢極少安定的希望。因為“和平不可分割。”實為一句至理名言。在目前侵略者積極活動。中歐與西班牙局勢危險萬狀之際。要保持西歐一角的安定。實在是很少可能的。</p>

<p>［倫敦］艾登外相現定於下星期中、分別接見法•比•德•意四國大使、俾就羅卡諾新公約與比國中立地位兩項問題進行談話、負責方面頃證實、英政府現擬先行解决比國中立地位問題、然後進行羅卡諾新公約之談判、藉使比總理齊蘭得在比京衆議員補缺選舉（指總理輿該國法西斯派萊克斯黨領袖德格勒爾競選而言）之前、獲得滿意、特比國中立地位問題、前途尚多困難、一則比國欲禁止外國軍隊假道比國、此與國聯盟約第十六條第三節所載明之義務（指國聯會員國過有軍事制裁之時、應以假道之便利畀予其他會員國而言（互相抵觸、二則英國亟欲維持英法比三國參謀部所成立之愶定、（係去年德國廢止羅卡諾公約之後所成立、內容規定三國參謀部合作辦法）俾遇外國飛機飛越比國上空之時、即由比國予以通告是也、英京政界人士頃復評論意德兩國關於羅卡諾新公約問題之備忘錄、以為若由法德兩國承諾互不從事戰爭、並由英意兩國加以保證、實等於一九三三年四強公約之復活、果爾、歐洲各小國自必感覺不安、此外、關於法蘇兩國互助公約德國所採熊度、雖不復如前時之完全否定、但仍耍求修改該公約中若干條欵、而將自動的機械性之互助辦法、予以廢除、此則殊未足以謀未來談判之順利也、（中央社十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］關於未來西歐公約問題、意政府昨日已向英國提出備忘錄、答復英國二次照會、惟因英國二次照會及法國復文猶保守秘密、並未發表、故意國備忘錄暫時亦不能發表、但据負責方面透露消息、意國備忘錄包含三要點如下、</p>
<p>㊀一九二五年　羅卡諾公約曾有廣大之功效、意國茲準備依照此項公約之大綱、以商訂未來西歐公約、但各項新因素如德國在萊因河沿岸重設防務等事、則均應加以顧及、㊁未來西歐公約、詞句務求明白確切、俾實施之際、手續簡易而捷速、㊂關於比國領土完整問題、意國準備與英法德三國提供同樣保證、此外意國備忘錄、聞曾提及未來西歐公約與法蘇兩國互助公約之關係、但負責方面既稱、“各項新因素均應加以顧及”、其意當指未來西歐公約興法蘇兩國互助公約、並非完全牴觸云、（中央社十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>法閣會議</h3>
<p>外長出席報告　德備忘錄內容</p>
<p>［巴黎］內閣今日午後舉行會議、主席大總統勒白倫、當由外長台爾博斯將德國關於羅卡諾新公約所提備忘錄內容、向國務會議有所陳述、並對於西班牙內亂不干涉辦法監察計劃之運用方式、就技術上提出報告、此外法國駐英大使考賓、已自倫敦返此、當將英國方而對於德國備忘錄之反響報告外長、關於此項備忘錄、法國政界人士指出未來談判途徑雖未閉絕、特德國所抱觀點、則根本上並未改變、又德國僅欲英國為保障國、而不願其為被保障國、並主張法蘇兩國互助公約“運用情勢”（指互助條約、是否巳至運用之時而言）應由英意兩保障國加以核准、此其用意、乃欲廢除互助辦法之機械性、但法蘇兩國互助公約、其實並無自動機械性、蓋按照該公約所載、應先儘國聯行政院確定侵略國、假定行政院不能一致决定、則法國方有實施互助辦法之自由也、（中央社十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］關於新羅約問題、政界人士頃就報載德政府備忘錄中各項要點加以評論、謂德備忘錄中最可注意者、計有兩點、一則德國反對使英國同時成為保障國與被保障國、而主張依照舊羅卡諾公約之規定、英國僅能單方面保障法德兩國之安全、二則凡各項互助公約之在國聯盟約範圍內加以簽訂者、德國均加以反對、按一九三六年三月十九日德國單方面廢止羅約之後、英法比三國曾簽訂愶定、保持舊羅卡諾公約之條文、仍行繼續有效、該愶定內規定英國同時為保障國與被保障國、此與德國見地大不相同、且德國覆文對於舊公約中之一主要條文加以抹煞、根據該條文、簽約國是否有出兵援助之理由、共决定之權屬之於國聯會、但德國現乃提議在新公約內、當由英意兩保障國聯帶决定出兵援助之理由、此與奮公約又大相逕庭也、（中央社十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>俄駐英大使宣揚蘇聯軍威</h3>

<h3>現代政治與中國</h3>
<p>— 君山</p>
<p>各位同志：</p>
<p>在目前國難嚴重國際紛擾的環境中，我們對於現代政治的潮流和中國政治的歸宿，必須有一明確的認識，關於這個問題我們分四段落來講：</p>
<p>一·政治意義的解釋：</p>
<p>二·近代政治的真相；</p>
<p>三·近代政治的更變；</p>
<p>四·結論。</p>
<p>一·政治意義的解釋。</p>
<p>總理說：“政是衆人的事，治是管理，管理衆人的事就是政治”——這巳經成了今天的定論，用不着再討論；不過，我們還得同揚，補充，使各位對政治意義的解釋能有進一步的了解。</p>
<p>“管理衆人的事就是政治”我們從這句話裹可以看到三個特巴。那三個特色呢</p>
<p>第一·政治是管理衆人的事，而非衆人自行管理——治權——組織；</p>
<p>第二·政治是管理衆人的事，而非管理衆人——治法——典則；</p>
<p>第三·政治是管理衆人的事，而非不管理衆人的事與濫管理衆人的事——治人——領袖。</p>
<p>這三個特色，是我們今天研究三民主義政治學的人所必須了解的，因為這是一種定義，是我們必備的意念。為什麼我們說這三個特色，就是三民主義政治學的特色呢？我們可以一一解答出來。</p>
<p>第一個特色是“政治是管理衆人的事，而非衆人自行管理”，這就是說明了治權·各位都知道；總理的三民主義上是把政權治權劃分開了的，政權在民，治權在政府。三民主義有這樣一個精神，在政治的定義裹早就包涵了，就是“政治是管理衆人的事，而非衆人自行管理”。這即是治權，其表露為組織。</p>
<p>第二個特色是“政治是管理衆人的事，而非管理衆人”，這是一種什麼精神？就是要有治法。我們要知道：政治根本的一個依據就在有典有則，它絕對不是可以一時這樣，一時那樣的隨便，所以，一談到政治，一定就要創製種種典則來做依據。而這種典則也即是治法，這句話就是要有治法——其表露為典則。</p>
<p>第三個特色是“政治是管理衆人的事，而非不管理衆人的事輿濫管理衆人的事，”這就是說政治是離不開治人——誰也知道，一談到政治便有許多政治上的負責人。有些是消極方面不問政治，有些却從積極方面來管理政治。但是管理政治的人也須受了管理，這就產生了領袖。</p>
<p>上面這三個特色，合起來說，就是：要有組織，典則，領袖。這樣一來，便成了一個黨。因為有了綱領，有了組織，有了領袖，就是一個黨。所以，三民主義之政治的意義即是黨治的意義；總理所說的政治意思即是黨治。這是我們研究政治所首先耍有的基本認識。（未完）</p>

<h3>日本經濟外交與兒玉來華</h3>
<p>— 森禹</p>
<p>日本自林內閣成立後，共對華策略確實稍稍有些轉變，最顯著的，便是所講經濟外交。“經濟外交”，多麼漂亮的一個名詞啊！沒有內田康哉的“焦土外交”那樣怕人，亦沒有像廣田宏毅的“恊調外交”那樣不夠實惠；它多少稱得起所謂實事求是的，穩紥穩打的上好策略了。然而，他果眞能把中日間的鴻溝接通？果眞會使兩國進達於“共存共榮”的境地？這却值得我們下一番深切的思考。</p>
<p>由於裏裏外外各種現實因素的提示，日本當局也已經覺悟到一味再繼續蠻幹下去，對於其本國的前途是非常難以想像的；所以，就不得不部分的，暫時的緩和其過度急進的方策，改取比較穩健的途徑。即求侵略政策的合理化！這合理化的具體形態，在經濟合作和經濟提携等口號之下來從事對華的活動。這在日本自身打算，是生利的而非如軍事之為消耗的，軍事即使得到勝利，大有所獲，然而所耗巨量的資財，亦隨彈雨烟雲而同歸於盡，若眞做到經濟提携，倒能得着本利雙收，如果順利地發展下去，同樣能達到他理想的目的。又迎合了祇顧目前小利，不顧將來大害一部分中國人的脾胃，他們居然相信帝國主義和殖民地是可以講互惠合作，他們又相信中日間的關係，眞的能夠從經濟合作，經濟提携上面，來獲得根本的調整。同時更有另一部分人，以為能給日本相當的經濟利益，多少可以减少武力的糾纏，而可以茍且偷安過下，就這樣情况下，經濟提携的聲浪，便越發喊得響亮起來了。</p>
<p>二月十五日日本議會復會時，林銑十郞以兼外相的資格，曾經有過這樣的演說：“兩國民衆應融和感情，圖國交關係的明朗化，互相携手，……非僅政府如此，尤須刺激民間的接觸，以發揚日華提携恊助的實蹟”。這所謂民間的接觸，提携恊助，主要就是指明中日兩國應從事於經濟的提携。二十六日，外陸海藏四省幹部人員舉行變更對華政策會議，聽說會議的結果，决定暫時放棄對華傳統政策，將政治問題留待將來討論，目前則致全力於經濟的及文化的提携。二十七日，杉山陸相答覆議員問話時說：“日本的信念為中日關係必須先從經濟提携着手，日本目前即在使經濟提携的實現。”接着，　藤尚武新外相登台，他在議會裹幾次的答辯，也無不注重於所謂經濟外交的運用。要之，當前日本對華的策略，不論政黨財閥以至軍部，似巳有一致傾向於着力經濟進出的趨勢。據聞議會閉幕後。關於外交事情上將正式成立一常設會議機關，把過去，外陸海三省會議擴大，新加入大藏省，而為外陸海藏四省會議，經常討論外交方針，加入大藏省的用意，則以“促進對華經濟親善為主旨”。</p>
<p>且不僅日本政府方面是這樣，民間財界對於經濟上活動，向來就抱着不小的與趣。目前政府跟財界的關係，確實比從前增強不少；從前，由於軍部和財閥間的意見上對立得大深，對華政策以及對華經濟開發的見解，常常不能獲得怎樣的統一；今後，雙方的對立雖然未必完全消除，但至少是比過去調和得多（其實軍部和財閥本是兩位一體的）；而很明白的，在經濟外交之下，政府和一般財界巳經相當緊密的結合起來，積極進行對華經濟的進出。結城豐太郎之出任閣員，這正充分表明政府財界間關係的深切。現在，結城一方面做了內閣裹面的大藏大臣，一方面在財政界金融界經濟界仍舊居着指導的地位；他的重要性可想而知。他是一向竭力主張多就經濟方面以從事於對華經濟發展的，所以他的出馬，對於林內閣的經濟外交，顯然有着很大的推動力。</p>
<p>兒玉謙次等經濟使節已到中國了，這是日本經濟外交的第一聲。照兒玉於日前（十二日）離東京赴神戶時的談話，好像他們的來華是被動的；他說“中日貿易恊會今次在上海舉行，中國方面來函通告，並請日方代表出席，因此日本方面决然欣然出席大會。”然而，這只是表面上的官話，故意裝得若無其事而已。他不是同時又說？“我們想趁這個機會，視察中國朝野正在努力建設的財政經濟狀態，並和中國方面有力者，關於各種問題盡量交換意見。”和中國方面有力者盡量交換意見，”經濟外交的法寶，正藏在這幾句輕描淡寫的說話裹面啊！</p>
<p>無可否認的，兒玉等實際上就是對方正式派遣的使節，而來擋經濟外交的第一陣。他們的企圖是非常遠大的，據我們現在的推測，至少將進行下述幾項主要的工作：第一，謀整個中日經濟的結合，將以種種好聽的辭令，誘引中國以及一般經濟界的入彀，投入所謂“日‘滿’支布洛克”的懷抱裹去，把中國經濟去當做日本準戰時經濟的附屬品。“工業日本，農業中國，”這正合乎帝國主義跟殖民地經濟合作的標準形態。第二，關於開發華北經濟，和華北當局直接折衝是不夠，這次兒玉等“和中國方面有力者盡量交換意見”之際，必然要進一步作更具體的商談，華北是站在中國經濟提携的第一綫，而華北豐富的資源，又正是當前日本所認為最有利最合用的頭號對象物，據說，日本很想達到佔取華北經濟利益的合法化，可能範圍內，是願意盡量避免刺激中國人心的手段的。第三，就各別專項來說，那實在很多很多，下面舉出最重要的幾項吧㊀要求中國减低關稅，使有利於日本商品的進口。關於這一點，已經醞釀得不少的時間，它是“特殊貿易”的要抉條件。這裹，我們不必多加追溯，只要看看前幾天在上海所舉行的日本旅華商工會議的情形，就可以明瞭日方對於减低中國關稅運動是怎樣的起勁；上海天津青島各地提案中，無不物別重視於這一點。他們最主要的目的，是獨占中國市塲，不僅要把歐美各國的商品趕出去，更使中國自己的工業也始終無從抬頭㊁關於興建交通路綫，主要是建築鐵道和開闢航空，其範圍不祇限於華北，將擴展於中國各重要地域，因為只是華北一隅，日本方面還是不夠滿足的。他見到其他各國對華鐵道和航空綫的競爭，着實覺得有一些眼癢，尤其最近英美開拓遠東航綫的活躍，以及英法在川滇一帶，日方顯然抱着非常嫉妒的態度的（德國雖然是同行，但日本對於他在某種程度以上的活動，當然也不大樂意）是的，日本的資力有限，不能盡獲理想的發展；但它終不得不和別國相競爭，至少要設法排除英美法等現時種種的進出，以免自身勢力範圍相對的縮小。也許，兒玉等對於這個問題，或將對中國方面提出非正式的交涉吧㊂關於中國金融上的領導權，日本寤寐求之已久，只是因為力量不夠，所以始終爭不過雄厚的歐美資本，尤其根深蒂固的英國霸權；然而，日本的野心是永遠不會放棄的，它沒有一天不在努力的進攻。本月十日貴族院預算總會開會時，竟從談論經濟外交而牽涉到英國的匯豐銀行，佐藤外相也這樣說“對於經濟外交，認為仿照英國的匯豐銀行，我國（日本）也有必要”這不是充分地表露日本羨嫉英國匯豐銀行的金融勢力嗎？它正有取而代之的意圖；可能與否，乃另一問題而已。所以這次兒玉等來華，關於推進日本在中國的金融勢力，必然也是重要項目之一。兒玉等所主張上海日本銀行所存儲的白銀應交還中國，不得不認為有相當的骨子的，他們未始不想拿九百萬的白銀，來做一樁理想的好買賣。㊃此外，如關於日本在華工商業者土地權的取得（據聞日本旅華商工會議中，青島方面第四個提案便是：“業商工業者之營業居住及其他必要土地之取得問題），日本商品在中國鐵道運費的减低（同上會議中，濟南方面第二個提案便是：一在中國國有鐵道運輸日本及在華日本工廠出品貨物之差別運費案”），以及擴大並强化日本在華商務機關，信用擔保貸欵等等，也一定都為兒玉等所關心，這裹舉不勝舉。㊄再則，正如兒玉所說：“將趁這個機會，視察中國朝野正在努力建設的財政經濟狀態；”調查和考察，這當然是兒玉等此行要務之一，他們可以見到中國經濟的現實狀態，以至屬於經濟以外的各方面的情形。這於日本未來對華手段的動向上，是很有直接的關係的。</p>
<p>現在，我們冉來看看霄使節團的團員吧，他們大都是日本經濟界一二流的人物，這又可以認識使節團的重要性了。團長兒玉謙次做過橫濱正金銀行，海支行行長，後又曾升任該行總裁，現任日本日華貿易恊會會長，對於中國情形固然相當熟悉，在日本國內又具有很高聲望。其次，團員日本郵船會社社長大谷登，朝鮮銀行總裁加藤敬三郎，前二菱商事董事長三宅川百太郎，日清紡織會社社長官島情次郎，三井物產專務董事石田禮助，大日本製糖會社社長藤山愛一郎，日清汽船會社社長堀新，三菱合資會社參輿秋山昱禧，日華貿易恊會常務理事油谷恭一（以上東京方面），在華日本紡織業同業會委員長飯尾一二，東洋紡織社長，大日本紡織聯合會會長莊子丙吉，住友銀行常務董事大平賢作（以上大阪方面），名古屋商工會議所副會長，谷由紡織會社社長谷田利三郎等（以上名古屋方面）等，個個都有重要的職位，綱羅了金融業，紡織業，運輸業，製糖業以及進出口業。尤其紡織業的代表特別多，可見今後日本對華紡織業的進出，必較以前要更其積極起來：據說日本紡織業及日本在華紡織業提議中日雙方紡織業訂互助恊定，這是值得重視的。被壓榨得透不過氣來的中國紡織業，它的前途是多麼危殆啊！互助恊定，誰相信有眞正的互助！而况現在的日貨正規的與特殊的漫天塞地而來，不久之後，說不定所見皆是日貨了</p>
<p>那末，在當前這樣的現實狀態之下，所謂中日經濟提携，到底能不能獲得正規的恊調呢？這，我們似乎不必多引大套的理論，就借用日本方面自己所說的話來答覆便夠了。上海日本商工會議所會長吉田在東京所刊小冊子裹說：“日本所採的方策，常招致日本對中關係的退步，例如對於中國幣制改革的態度，及所謂華北特殊貿易等，日本或認其態度為合理，但中國感覺這種態度極屬無理，且亦費解。……關於老生常談的經濟合作，僅在中國仍在半封建和半殖民地狀况下，及中國仍為原始的農業國家時始為可能。……日本必須芟除嚴峻的對華政策，而採取在道德上能為中國政府接受且切合實際的政策。</p>
<p>本月八日日本新外相佐籐尚武在貴族院答覆大河內子演說中有云：“日前中日問題只有吾儕改變方法，另從新起點着手方可解决，完全獨立國家間的交涉，應以平等地位為根據。……吾儕常遲疑採取對等地位，而已優越地位自居，此種優越觀念在國際關係上常引起極大的障碍。”</p>
<p>再看這次來華經濟使節團長兒玉謙次於本月三日對中央社記者的談話“關於經濟提携一點，雖意見紛岐，惟一般均誠摯感覺中日兩國友好關係之改善，及兩國人民之和諧，實為先决條件，在對立情况之下，欲使提携順利進行，實極感困難……吾人誠摯相信在政治堅决尊重中國之領土主權，在經濟上嚴格保持兩國之互惠平等；遵此原則，以謀改善兩國關係當非難事。—一日離東京赴神戶搭船時，兒玉文重覆的說：“據余旧念，兩國無立於尊重領土主權，互惠平等之原則，以改善兩國國交。”</p>
<p>“尊重領土主權，互應平等，”這是中國人最低限度的信念；但這需要由日本方面切切實實來做到，决不能隨便說說就算，或者竟是一張永不兌現的支票。我們自然不敢武斷地說，他們所說的話，不過是表面文章，可是，事實終於不能不使我們對這些“誠意”有些懷疑，不，簡直無法信任！聽吧：本月九日伍堂商相在衆議院裹說：“滿洲是獨立國……滿洲之產業計畫及資金，均由日本一手造成，若此種滿洲竟被中國所威脅，當　我國（日本）產業之奇恥大辱。”又，日本外務省發言人於十日答覆外國訪員問話時說：“平等互惠均為國際法所承認之原則，但茍涉及具體問題，如冀東及察北等，則因錯綜複雜之故，應視為另一事件。”接着，十二日佐藤外相在衆議院裹也打着自己的嘴吧演說，竟稱滿洲國是業已成為堅定的既成事實；他將繼續履行由　田二原則所蛻化的，有田時代三基本原則。偽滿可以當做“既成事實”，冀東察可以視為“另一事件”；所謂尊重領土主權究竟在那裹？</p>
<p>讓我們再看事實的事實：“日軍用機仍在冀察不斷來往”，一日在豐台購地闢飛機塲，”“津日租界準備展拓”，“華北新漢奸團體活躍”日韓浪人販運毒品”，“日特務機關人員陰謀搗亂中國政治”，“偽冀東銀行開幕”，“大批私貨武裝輸送入境”“浪人抗拒緝私”“浪人刦奪海關”“舊偽組織沒法取消，新偽組織傳說又將實現了。”這一切的一切，不是每天都登在新聞紙上麼？鐵一般的事實，不管他外交上的辭令是怎樣的巧妙，上述情形如存在，天，中日關係恐永遠沒有調和的一天！</p>
<p>解决政治問題為經濟提携的先决條件，主權不恢復，失地不牧回，談什麼平等！談什麼互惠！正像佐籐所說，達到目的有各種不同的路綫，所謂經濟外交，也僅路綫之一而巳，根本政策何嘗有些許的變更！</p>
<h3>日本結城財政的透視</h3>
<p>— 周閬琛</p>
<p>㊀結城財政的由來</p>
<p>日本的財政，在高橋是清做財長的時代，普通稱為“高橋財政：”在馬塲锳－做財長的時代，普通稱為“馬塲財政，”這次結城豐太郎做了財長，也就照例稱為“結城財政”了。</p>
<p>這三種財政，內容顯然是不同：</p>
<p>高橋財政被稱為“健全財政”的；他的財政政策是：租稅不增，公債漸减，金利聽其自然，國防費阻其增加，因此稅制也就用不到急於整理。高橋財政頗能得金融資本家的歡心，却不合軍部的口味，所以二·二六事變時，終於做了犧牲。</p>
<p>馬塲財政繼高橋財政而起，他恰巧與高橋財政相反背，以“偏軍財政”為依歸，他的財政政策是：增課租稅•增發公債•因此稅制也必須有根本的改革。馬塲財政為迎合軍部的要求，提出了一個卅萬四千萬圓的龐大預算，馴致物價飛漲，股票猛跌，公司債無人應募，大工事因原料漲價均行擱淺，而一般市民，也因生活困難，怨聲載道，於是馬塲財政遂被稱為“無軌道財政，”不能不連帶廣田內閣以俱倒了。</p>
<p>結城財政是龔馬塲財政的軀殼而上台的。他繼承了馬塲財政的“偏軍財政”，却加以多少的减削，而且經過他一番减削之後，其為空前的龐大預算，雖則不變，而其本質却已顯然不同了。</p>
<p>以下便擬以結城財政為中心，以馬塲財政為對照，而說明結城財政的本質。</p>
<p>㊁結城財政的前身</p>
<p>如上所述，結城財政是襲馬塲財政的軀殼而上台，故其為“偏軍財政”，了無疑義。但為理解結城的偏軍財政，不能不先對馬場財政的“偏軍財政”，作一個本質上的說明。</p>
<p>原來馬場锳一本為勸業銀行的總裁；所謂勸業銀行是日本的不動產銀行；它的主要業務便是放欵以及勸業債券的發行。放欵分抵押放欵，信用放欵，特別担保放欵以及五十年以內的年金償還放欵，與五年以內的定期償還放欵；抵押品以不動產為原則，例如田地，宅地，房屋，工場財團，漁業財團，軌道財團等均可為抵押品。次之，勸業債券的發行，乃為吸收放欵資金的一方法。此項債券的發行限度，原為收足資本的十倍。其後更擴張而為收足資本的十五倍。由勸業債券所吸收下來的資金，放給農村與漁村，這實在是勸業銀行的職能。由此也可知勸業銀行的基礎，全在農村，救濟農村便是救濟勸業銀行。所以廣田內閣為拉攏農村，特請馬場氏出長財政，而馬場氏出長財政之後，一面投合軍部的心理，一面也就放手偏護農村，間接即所以偏護勸業銀行。</p>
<p>馬場氏的立場既然如此，所以他的龐大預算的本質，一方面是儘量的膨脹軍事費，一方面是大量的擴充恊欵，就是由國府補助地方財政的經費竟達二萬萬元以上。</p>
<p>要之，馬場的偏軍財政是農村本位的；對工商業實行徵稅，將徵稅所得的錢，大部分送之海陸兩部，小部分挹波注此，對農村做一個人情。這是馬場財政的本質。</p>
<p>㊂結城財政的背景</p>
<p>然而結城豐太郎本為與業銀行的總裁，所謂興業銀行是日本的動產銀行，它的主要業務，是公債，公司債，股票的承受及發行。如此，對於國家，地方自治團體，以及各種事業公司提供着世額的資金，以助事業的發展；那承受下來的有價證券，後來到適當的時機，可以脫售於市場，這樣承受價格“興一脫售價格”的差額，便成了興業銀行的利藪。就中，興業銀行的營業尤注重於各種事業公司的股票，公司債的承受及發行；從可知興業銀行與勸業銀行相反，他的基礎在乎工商業的繁榮。</p>
<p>所以林大將組閣、為救濟工商界，便得請出與業的總裁結城氏當財長；結城氏當了財長，雖則仍舊維持龐大預算以博軍部的歡心，而其龐大預算的本質，卻因興業銀行的背景而為之改變了。</p>
<p>㊃結城財政的精神</p>
<p>結城財政的產生既如上述，現在我們可以從他修正案（對於馬場財政預算書的修正案）中，指出他根本的精神；這約而言之，可以歸納為兩點：</p>
<p>㊀偏軍財政　結城財政雖把馬場財政的龐大預算（三十萬四千萬元）减削了二萬二千萬元而成為二十八萬一千萬元，但其為“偏軍財政”則根本沒有改變。原來在馬塲預算案，昭和十二年度海陸兩省的經費如下：（單位千元）</p>
<p>這海陸軍兩項合計（一，四○九，六一八千元），比昭和十一年度要增加三五一百萬元，若比了七年度的七二四百萬元乃為兩倍的增加。這次結城氏减削預算，封於這龐大的軍事費，在修止案上却不曾减了一文，只是其中有四千六百萬元，停止使用，這停止使用的四千六百萬元，海陸兩省各占一半，而且陸軍省的－半是延至次年度使用的。</p>
<p>從可知結城預算，仍是十足的“偏軍財政”</p>
<p>㊁工商本位的財政　上文說過，馬塲財政是農村本位的，所以他對於大小地主階級的利益特別關切，換言之，他是重課工商階級以轉惠農村的。在馬塲案中，一方面沒有一地万調整交付金（按即恊欵），其數額為二萬二千萬元，是應由國庫解繳給地方的；他方面這二萬一千萬元的金額，幾乎有一半是來自所得稅輿資本利子稅的增課，這便是取之於工商注之於農村，現在結城財政便顯然不同了。結城氏是重視工商。輕視農村的，所以他的財政是工商本位的財政。他一方把二萬二千萬元的地方交付金，鈎銷了一萬五千萬元，將舊有的臨時財政補助費由二千萬元增為七千萬元•這樣農村至少吃虧了一萬萬元。這換言之，國府可以少開銷一萬萬元便可以减收一萬萬元的稅，恰巧這一萬萬元在馬塲預算中是來自直間稅的，現在結城案就乾乾脆脆的把他减削了。</p>
<p>馬塲案的增稅總額原為四萬六千萬元（包括關稅增收額）現在結城氏的修正案中，增稅額共為二萬五千三百萬元，故結城氏修正案中實已减去了增稅額一萬七千萬元。這減少的一萬七千萬元大部分為工商業的課稅，根據概算如下：</p>
<p>Ａ停止所得税的特别附加，减輕……七千八百萬元</p>
<p>Ｂ减輕其他直接税……一千六百萬元</p>
<p>Ｃ减輕間接税……三千六百萬元</p>
<p>Ｄ停止交易税，减輕……三千萬元</p>
<p>Ｅ减輕關税……一萬七千餘萬元</p>
<p>共計…………………………一萬七千餘萬元觀上表，可知AB兩項幾達一萬萬元，均是减輕工商界的負擔的，此外如停止交易稅亦是惠及工商的。</p>
<p>從可知結城財政是工商本位的財政。</p>
<p>㊄結城財政减稅之眞相</p>
<p>更有進者，馬塲財政增稅四萬六千萬元，這增稅額之中須扣除一萬二千萬元，作為地方交付金，仍得還之於國民（農村），故實際的增稅額僅有二萬四千萬元，結城氏的增稅額為二萬九千萬元，但只須扣除臨時町村財政補助金七千萬元，故實際增稅額却也有二萬二千萬元，茲列一簡表以明之如下，（單位千元），</p>
<p>故僅就國稅觀之，結城案比了馬塲案减稅甚多，（减稅額為460，000，000-290000，000=170，000，000元），但合地方租（指恊欵等而言）觀之，則結城的减稅實在甚少，甚减低額僅為二千萬元罷了。（240，000，000-220，000，000=20000，000元），</p>
<p>故結城財政，對於國庫增收的自的，雖已達到，而於國民負擔的不均衡則被置之度外了。</p>
<p>㊅公債發行額</p>
<p>結城財政一方面把租稅减輕了一萬七千萬元，他方把歲出亦减削了二萬三千八百萬元，但全部歲人與全部歲出相抵尚不足七七二•二五三•○○○元，則非乞靈於公債的增發不可</p>
<p>這七七二•二五三•○○○元，原為一般會計的公債發行額，如合特別會計的公債發行額而計之，則為九一五，○○○•○○○元•茲將結城案的公債發行額與馬塲案的公價發行額比較如下：</p>
<p>由上表可知結城財政的公債發行額，比了馬塲財政，雖則要少一千餘萬元，却仍不失為一個龐大的公債數字。</p>
<p>㊆結城財政的歸宿</p>
<p>由上所述，可知結城財政，實際上仍是既增稅又增債的財政。不過把農村的困難置之度外，把工商界的負擔减輕不少罷了。財政龐大的結果，必定造成“財政壓迫經濟”的局面：尤其是既增稅而增債的財政政策，是格外的能造成此種局面的。然而在“偏軍財政”的前提之下，增稅增債是兩皆必需的。這裹所成為問題的，是兩者的比率問題。就是兩者之間保持怎樣的比例，才能免得多大的摩擦，這才是應考慮的問題。結城財政的减稅（就國稅而言為大减稅）目標，大約也就在此。</p>
<p>可是租稅與公債，同樣出之於人民，固然租稅的繳納是强制的，公債的應募是自動的，但國家要藉這二條路徑，籌築龐大的經費，必須民間有如許的富力才行，否則民間富力竭枯，納了租便沒有餘力承募公債，或者即有餘力亦不肯承募公債，那麼所謂增債，豈非等於畫餅。</p>
<p>聰明的結城氏，自然是顧慮到這一點的。所以他在就任之初，便注意到金融統制了。</p>
<p>說到金融統制，第一便得注意到中央銀行，這在日本是為日本銀行，原來日本銀行的前總裁深井英五氏，是日本銀行的傳統主義的保護者，他於金融政策是採取保守的消極的態度的。所以他興高橋財政配在一起，最為和諧；到了馬塲財政已不合宜，馬塲財政沒有日本銀行的合作，亦為失敗的一原因，所以這次結城氏上了台，便排走了深井，引入了田成彬氏。池田氏為結城氏的同鄉（同為山形縣）原為三井財閥的大夥計，且為日本金融資本的總大將，它素向抱有“以金融統制產業”的大志，這次結城氏請他出山，自可使這位老將大獻一番身手，以國家的金融資本（日本銀行）來統制產業了。</p>
<p>這統制的方針，不消說，就是由國家的金融資本助長產業，由整個的產業為財政的後援。這裹消極方面大約須繼續的實行低金利政策，以便驅民間的游資，不值得投之於別途，只好投之於公債，積極方面，日本銀行的公開市塲交易（Open　Market　Operation）不但以賣的交易（出賣公債的交易）為滿足，且當進而盛行買的交易。如此公債雖則增發。當不患不能消化。此外由金融統制產業，意即為由金融扶掖產業，產業發達了，租稅自然可以增收了。所以結城財政除興業銀行外把日本銀行拉在一起，實在是一個强點：他由統制金融來支持他的財政，實在是一个妙策。</p>
<p>㊇遺下的問題</p>
<p>然則結城財政就此一路順風，毫無問題了嗎？這也不是的。馬塲氏以提出龐大豫算引起物價飛漲，因而迫得下台，結城氏為救濟漲的物價，特定出一個减稅的修正案，以為𨥏底抽薪之計。然而日本的物價就肯這樣降低了嗎？我們試研究日本物價飛漲的主要原因，大約不外下列三點：</p>
<p>（一）日本産業本來是生産過剩，但近年以來，軍需工業發達，社會上因軍需景氣之故，一般購買力較强，因此一般商品，存貨漸漸出淸，生産既不感過剩，物價自趨高漲。</p>
<p>（二）因龐大預算之故，政府之購買力强旺，商人豫想物價將貴，故意抬高價格，故物價愈趨高潮。</p>
<p>（三）因關税抬高原料漲價，製品亦必隨之漲價。</p>
<p>上列三點之中，只有第三個原因，已被結城取政所取消了；其餘第一·第二兩原因，仍是絲毫没有動過。所以要壓低物價實在是很困難的。</p>
<p>物價不能壓低，一則大衆的生活將大感困難，這解决的方法，只有加薪之一途，但普遍的加薪，益復助長了物價的激騰。二則物漲過高，則滙兑傾銷將失其作用，對外輸出自將爲之萎縮，而使國際貸借陷於逆勢了。</p>
<p>所以物價問題，終究是結城財政所最不易解决的問題。</p>

<h3>東北的秧歌</h3>
<p>— 雪文</p>
<p>在東北，每當過了舊歷年的時候，正月裏，一些消閒的人們，便循例要來自動的舉辦一些普羅化的娱樂，最普通的幾種，是蹈高蹻，要龍燈，和跑旱船等等。</p>
<p>「踩高蹻」在東北是極爲流行的，玩的人以兵士或村中的青年農人爲最多，人數多寡無定，普通是三四十人吧！他們每人脚上都綁着一副離地二尺來高的木頭的「高蹻腿，」身上穿着各色各式的服裝，而且各自化裝成不同的形相，好像舞臺上的戲子一樣，有生，旦，丑等等，而其中多半還都是根據着中國的舊劇。最不可少的，當然是白蛇青蛇許仙哪！鶯鶯張生哪！小老媽哪！他們的玩法有所謂「唱」，多半是流行的民歌。其次是所謂「扭」，就是彼此做着攝揄的猥褻或戲謔的挑逗！那種無忌放肆和淫蕩，衛道先生一定會以爲是有傷風化的吧！</p>
<p>「耍龍燈」，多半是由村中人舉辦，龍的樣子，是用若干塗畫上鱗片的布，在竹圈外面弄成筒形，安上一頭一尾，晚上的時候，就在龍的腹中放上一支支的蠟燭，照得通亮。玩的方式很多。最重要的則是舉龍頭的人，這是得有經騐的老手才作得來的，什麽「戲珠」啊！「翻江攪海」呀，使人看了那龍的不停的舞動，宛然如生的一般，有趣之至，夜間尤其熱鬧。</p>
<p>「跑旱船」是三個人玩的玩藝兒，是三個人玩的玩藝兒，兩人裝作女子相，身旁紥上船似的東西看來好像是坐在船裏頭。另外一個人則作着滑稽的小丑的裝束，拿着一個撑船的桿子，在兩船中間來回跑，且向扮作的女子挑逗着，作出種種可笑的舉動來，有時也「唱」的。</p>
<h3>光福虎嘯橋</h3>
<p>— 傅炳麟</p>
<p>又是看梅花的季節了，自然要回憶到故鄉的鄧尉。因了鄧尉，便連想到光福的虎嘯橋。「虎溪夕照」爲福溪之名勝之一。但消息傳來，該橋忽於上月因年久失修，全部傾圮；那麽今年去鄧尉探梅的人，只有一番殘跡可供憑吊了。</p>
<p>虎嘯橋横跨西淹，介于虎山與塔山之間。西淹爲太湖之尾閭，與銅坑相望，同爲水流湍急之處。塔山背倚寺崦嶺，一峯高聳，隱爲屏枕，故形勢十分雄壯。夕陽時候，塔影橋身，湖光嶺色，相互掩映，大爲奇麗。每當暮春三月，虎山上開滿了絢紅的樟榔花，半山似火，與沿堤小桃柳爭艷，至耐尋味。（在晨光曦微中憑橋溜眺，可以望見大湖中漁帆點點，出没烟波。）一到垂暮，那無數漁艇，都鼓棹歸來，將近虎嘯橋口，因水流湍急，便自然的喧鬧爭渡，却是一幅絶妙的漁船唱晚圖。橋東舊有馮桂芬的讀書草堂，而現在是都成陳迹了。</p>
<p>該橋完全石質，係三環洞式。建於乾隆年間，乃一士人獨資捐造。橋身早已傾側。光福西北十二鄉村居民，皆經該橋入鎭。橋坍時適在深夜，並無一舟一人受害，尚稱大幸。據虎山廟內的和尚説：「橋坍之前數夜，橋旁每聞哭聲凄厲，實係預兆。」</p>
<p>故老傳説：捐建該橋之士人，因暮年得子，感恩白衣大士，遂發愿興築此橋。但費了無數木樁，工程，總打不好該橋的樁址。最後他擬以身殉。觀音大士被他感動，便託夢給他，向他説：「明天上午有一癩痢呌化行過此處，可誠心求助于他」。翌晨果然有個癩痢乞者從遠處施施而來。那士人便跪地求助，癩痢呌化却不理睬他。急得士人叩頭流血，那乞兒才吩咐士人去買三斤上好南棗來。棗子買來之後，癩痢呌化嘆了一口氣，説道：「該橋命運如此。」便只顧大吃棗子，吃出一顆棗核，便向湖中一丢。吃完之後，拂袖逕起，倐忽不見。看那岸灘却已打好結實堅固一百零七個棗木大樁。原來本需橋樁一百單八個，但買棗子的人偷吃了一枚，於是少去橋樁一個，橋造成之後就有些圮側。鄉人又説凡爲該橋攝影的，皆不能將橋攝正。其實一則因地位（除非在船上拍）斜，二則橋本身略側，自然不能攝得橋之正影了。光福區公所已在籌劃重建鋼骨水泥橋樑，但是不知再找得到那癩痢和尚否？</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回（絮語感慈幃懺情殉孝秋光黯翠黛觸景書懷）</p>
<p>今天不然，他老遠的看過兩眼之後，走到身邊，還把脚歩停止了。雖是他停着脚歩，不過很快的幾秒鐘，可是他顯然的爲了見着國器而停頓，國器是知道的。國器想着，他或者有了不堪抑鬱的意思，要對人表白一番，那麽，自己就站住了聽他説什麽罷。國器是剛剛有了這點意思，還不曾把脚站住呢，夢蘭可又低了頭一歩跟着一歩，慢慢的走了。國器果在巷子中間站定了，只是向了夢蘭的後影出神。回想他的臉色是那樣沉着，眼光呆定，睫毛下垂，兩道眉毛緊緊的要觸到一處。更又想到他平常雖不敷脂粉，可是雪白的皮膚上，透出兩塊紅暈，也像淡淡的抹了脂粉一樣。可是剛才所看到他的臉色，帶了有一分蒼白，紅暈是消蝕得一點都没有了。看他這情形，心裏的憂鬱，似乎有極大的醖釀了。有好幾天没有接着也的信，由這裏看來，决不是他對自己怎麽淡淡下來，完全由於他受環境的壓廹，心裏别有所感，假使彼此已經通過言語了，恐怕他今天見面之下總有千言萬語的苦惱，要説出來。不看他那微彎的眉黛，好像有點顫動，而且眼睛角上，還藏着淚珠要滴下來嗎？於是自己摇了幾下頭，又嘆了一口氣，然後一歩一歩的走着回家去。到家以後，也不同什麽人説話，把房門口門簾子放了下來，於是背了兩手，在屋子裏來回的走着。走得有些疲倦了，就坐下來，把書桌上那個維納絲像，兩隻手捧住，左右轉動着，只管看去。隨後把像放下來，自言自語的道；在封建時代，中西的思想，都是一樣，中國人神話，是月裏嫦娥嫁了那個暴君后羿。西方的神話，是維納絲的嫁了惡運之神，這不是偶然的，那目擊心傷的詩人文人，寄託遥深呀。於是把偶像放到原處，將一方歙硯移到面前，取出一方古墨，緩緩的磨着，當他磨着墨的時候，兩眼向窗子外看去。窗子的磚台上，正列了幾盆大葉秋海棠，開得嬌豔欲滴。桌上蒲草盆子邊，紫色小膽瓶裏，插了一剪白菊花，細細的花瓣，正是要開未開，便感到書案上面，滿佈下秋氣了。（一四四）</p>
<h3>惜梅</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>在這百花休假期間，自然界只有蕭條，寂寞；但庭子間的梅花，偏偏熬着風寒，緣而黄的蕊兒，漸漸地，忸怩地，吐放了花朶；那種幽雅淸芬的香味，時時襲到鼻裏，頓時使人嗅了精神爲之一爽。</p>
<p>在室內覺着寒冷，就在庭子間放着臥椅，躺上去，正對了太陽，自然熱就這樣傳送到身上；一面看着書報，梅花好像能體會人的內心的，將它的香味送來；媚呢？慰呢？我只得愉快。並忍心地摘下一二朶塞在鼻子裏。</p>
<p>它的香味，並不限於一隅；還四濺出去，第一就誘起小朋友的好奇心，時時來尋訪它了；拜謁以後，各人手裏都採着花兒。不久，許多姑娘小姐們，也來光顧了；在一個下午的過去，梅花呀？賸着枯椿了。當我發覺以後，木已成舟，再不能挽救；可愛的梅花，都犧牲去了。完了。唉！它如果没有色香，恐怕也没有這樣大的創傷吧！梅花是我們的國花，看了它的被踐，更憂慮大中華民族的前途。</p>

<p>前天我在理髮的時候「那個理髮匠告訴我，他説他預備把他的家眷接到上海來同住，他説他工作了十幾年，已經積蓄了一點錢，現在每月並可以有數十元的進欵，近以簡單的生活很可以維持了。於是我便對他講了一篇「生活須要先苦而後甜，和「治家須量入爲出」的道理。我還對他説：「我是時時刻刻要講道理的，其實人生在世上，處處都不離道理，兒童在襁褓的時候，受父母的養育，這就是教他生長的道理，及至走進學校，受師長的教誨，這就是教他處世的道理。隨後走進社會作事更離不開服務的道理，譬如像你做一個理髮匠，也有你理髮的道理。道理對於人就像軌道對於車輛，不講道理的人就像脱了軌道的車輛，那是非常危險的啊！」</p>
<h3>天津爛飯</h3>
<p>— （希旦）</p>
<p>提起了「天津爛飯」，未免有些陌生。好在這個並不是專門名詞；不過是林語堂的令兄林玉霖的一句「口頭語」</p>
<p>當他老人家留學美國的時候，看見了活潑的孩童，滿口不絶的稱讚着「天津爛飯」！「天津爛飯」記得去年他的大中中學高中部教授英文，他的教授法老是把偌大的學生當小孩子看。如果有讀音不十分凖確，必須要你連念十遍廿遍；務使學生發了恨，拚命的念，念準了才停，他更又是滿口「天津爛飯」。表示着欣慰。林先生所説的「天津爛飯」乃是「天真爛漫」的福建話。</p>
<h3>種花與養花</h3>
<p>— （陳天賜）</p>
<p>春天，花因寒冷的關係，往往開放較遲，故種花的，須用馬糞水來灌澆，那末花容易開放。</p>
<p>此外，一班人凡是要將花折下，插在瓶內供養，須用四分水和入三分酒，如此花能耐久而遲萎。</p>
<p>上述這兩種方法，是我幾年來種花和養花的經騐，我想現在愛好花的讀者們一定很多，如果要種花或養花的時候均宜採用上法。因爲簡便而容易做到</p>
<h3>簡體字與鐫字匠</h3>
<p>— （枕綠）</p>
<p>近人鼓吹簡體字，學者爭爲左右持，教部既訂制字表頒行，忽又止之，手足之無所措也甚矣！粤稽古代，未有筆也，書以勿鐫，羣病字跡之煩，則由大篆而小篆，而隸，演進之情簡是趨。洎乎文書之用日繁，而傳布之未有活字板如今之便也，書板之一筆一劃，靡不假手於鐫字之匠。匠人計工得資利其迅，乃以人監可辨無害詞義爲範，採其筆簡而音同者，或省其偏旁，或造作形似，以代繁筆費工之體。彬彬之士，恤其工程，姑息涵容，莫爲非議。舉筆圖便者又從而效之，變其本而加之厲，而簡體之字百出矣！所惜變幻之至，不免以字害詞，以詞害意，所謂：「欲速不達」「治絲益棼」！教部之幡然改圖，其亦再思有未便歟？斯作俑者，鐫字匠之怠事者爲之，而乃有後，不亦傎乎？</p>
<h3>李公雜碎</h3>
<p>— （頴）</p>
<p>粤菜中有名「李公雜碎者，此菜取名之由來，實有其趣妙之故事在焉。海外華僑，皆能津津道之。此事傳之已久，爲明日黄花，無足道述，惟以事極有趣，爰記之於後。</p>
<p>李津章素嗜粤菜，於出使美國時，曾邀請美友至粤菜館宵夜但時間過晚，各菜早已售罄，餘下者皆零碎小件，不能成整菜矣。惟李及美友以不願掃興而返，遂令廚子凑雜製炒，以充飢腹。廚子承命，即將各盤解下之叉燒，燒鴨猪肚海參臘味芽菜等碎件，分炒二大盤，供饗此數位貴賓，然此不過臨時應付之辦法，實從未嘗試也。不料貴眼識易牙，竟大稱佳餚名廚，賞贊不絶，當地華僑，一時傳爲美談。以後各粤菜館，遂相繼效顰，增添此菜，名「李公雜碎」。此粤菜中「李公雜碎之由來也。</p>
<h3>謎趣</h3>
<p>— （必力）</p>
<p>普濟寺，草離離。空花園，或借棲。夫人有病頭難起。一支香，告神祗。薄暮日沈西。雖有約，負佳期；張生長不至，錯認了白馬將軍來矣。右西廂故事射孟子「晋國天下莫强焉」一句。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>三個我亦作如是觀云</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>外交官的言語，往往模稜兩可，不着邊際，僅語抽象的輪廓，不作具體的表示，所以外交官的論調，可作多方面的解說，照這樣去解釋可，照那样去解釋也可，故不善作滑稽論調者，不可做外交官，因為措詞過於肯定，他日有轉不得身的苦也。</p>
<p>話雖如此，假定有人問你外交上的某種事件，外交官雖不能作肯定的答復，但是抽象的輪廓，亦須表示，這也是外交官應有的態度，昨據報載，外國新聞記者往訪日外務省發言人，叩以外相佐藤在貴族院的演說，是否日本改變態度，將尊重一切日本所簽訂之國際協定？該發言人輕率答曰，我亦作如是觀云，又詢以對九國公約如何？答曰我亦作如是觀云，又叩以日本在該約內，關於中國主權及土地完整之保障如何？該發言人再度答曰，我亦作如是觀云，這三個我亦作如是觀云，可謂盡滑稽之能事，其答等於不答，說等於不說。</p>
<p>假定有人問一友人，足下飯吃過否，答曰我亦作如是想，又問曰吃飯後有這麼公幹？答曰我亦作如是想，復又問曰晚間請你吃飯如何？彼又答曰我亦作如是想，則友人必拂然怒，認為藐視，侮辱，現在該發言人答，橫一個我亦作如是觀云，賢一個我亦作如是觀云，未免滑稽太甚，楞嚴經上有許多如是我聞，今發言人有許多我亦作如是觀，大約此公熟讀釋典者，新聞記者黃包車釘緊，有時亦有卹厭之處，然這樣對付，對於發言人之禮貌上，究屬自失身分，</p>
<p>惟各記者詢以朝日新聞所顯示關於日外務省對王外長的態度，是否確鑿？則發言人答曰，在原則上當無問題，蓋所謂平等互惠，均為國際公法所承認之原則，但涉及冀東察北等具體問題，應視為另一事件云，此語殊不可解，蓋冀東察北，亦為國際間重要問題之一，何以該問題獨不在國際公法所承認原則之內，而親為另一問題，既經以冀東察北事件，而認為另一事件，則何事不可例外，試問國際公法承認之原則，又在何許？</p>
<p>某外交家曾說過，中國祇要面子，而不問實際，祇要面子上過得去就與，所以此次佐藤發表演說，所謂經濟提携，所謂平等待遇，事寶上能照這種原則辦去，恐怕就有問題，故彼方除水鴨外交之外，現在還有面子外交，此亦國際交涉聲中新花樣也，我們國人，廳當歸清所謂待遇平等，所謂經濟提携的真相，團結一致，羣策羣力，合謀對付之法，此我國人所當深知者也。</p>
<h3>江上的悲歌</h3>
<p>— 瑞芝</p>
<p>——閩江上的船娘</p>
<p>夕陽西下了，那天際的紅霞，印在桃紅的江水上，低微的波浪，織成了一條金黃的長練，這是黃昏時閩江的美色。</p>
<p>當着這時，“科題”（註一）的船娘們，停正着了她們的操作，揺着木漿，向着聚集的江邊游去，那𠸄呀𠸄呀的音響，像給太陽奏着瀣歌的從江心中飛向那遼闊的天際。</p>
<p>船，漆着深紅的顏色的木船（註二）一排排地，好似是算盤中的珠子，一隻的連着一隻，密密地靠緊在那長滿着綠色的水草的岸邊。年老的婦人，從船艙里爬到船尾，燃起了晚炊的火熖，低聲的向着天空禱告（註三）小孩子們是成羣的望着岸上的田野和菓園奔去，那些年青的船娘，她們在艙子里，換去了日間的破衣，擦去了為工作而淌下的臭汗，塗上了香的粉，穿起了新的衣，梳着頭髮，揮着紅綠色的野花，走出了艙門，坐在船頭上等待着夜的到來。</p>
<p>在日間，那渡頭邊，那碼頭下，終日在風吹日晒之中，替客人搬運着行李，搬運着笨重的貸物，喘着氣，流着汗，沒有一刻的停息的船娘們，到了這時，一個個，好似美麗的宮女，坐在那掛着紅布簾的船頭，高聲的談笑，低聲的唱着山歌，她們，在期待着夜的客人的到来（註四）。</p>
<p>月亮在高空中闪耀着，那閩江中的水，微波好似是銀色的練一樣，點點燈火，從那岸邊的船中射出，照耀在江心里，又像是天上的繁星。這時有的船艙里，在飛散出男女狂笑的聲響，有的卻在奏送出那清脆撩亮的歌音。</p>
<p>當着夜深的時候，四野與空間已同歸於靜寂，這時狂笑的歡聲已停止，快樂的歌音也在人的耳際消失，唯一飛迸於夜空里的，就是那悲切的音調，不是歌也不是泣，是船娘們的低聲的嘆息，也許她們這時，在暗暗地痛恨着數百年前明太祖（註五），也許在怨着自己的命運。</p>
<p>當着天亮的時候，船娘們一個個憔悴着臉，重新拿起了木漿，開始的又做着她們終年終日沒有停息的工作。也許當回想起夜里的痛苦，她們會抱怨着族里的不爭氣的男人（註六）。然而一剎那間，那生活的重擔，又壓着她們的肩上，為着生活，為着了種族的生存，她們只好忘去了她們心中的隱痛，而於渡頭邊，碼頭下，做着她們的工作了。</p>
<p>日間為生活而操作，流着汗，喘着氣，夜間為着了生活而被摧殘，受着痛苦，受着威壓，人類中，“誰能知道閩江上的船娘苦”？（註七）。</p>
<p>（註一），“科題”是種族的名稱，如苗猺之類，同屬菸漢族以外的種族，“科題”種人在中國只閩江一處有的。</p>
<p>（註二）閩江上的紅色的船，即為“科題”人所有，據說是明太祖給她們特定的顏色，以免混亂。</p>
<p>（註三）船中的老婦人犬都係一船之主，每晚必禱告天保佑於今晚有客到船上來過夜。</p>
<p>（註四）船娘皆賣淫，傳係族中之規定，每個女人要做九年妓女，然後才能出嫁，所謂夜客人即嫖客。</p>
<p>（註五）相傳“科題”族於明太祖時，强佔福建閩訌－帶，殺死漢民無數，因此明太祖派兵征之，後下令不准“科題”人上岸工作求生，只准住於閩江上，因此直至現在，她們只有做船娘。</p>
<p>（註六）“科題”的男人，因苦於漢人之欺壓，又不能在陸上謀生，大都遠赴南洋各地謀生，故閩江中的紅色船中＂盡是女人，男人是少之又少。</p>
<p>（註七）這是她們山歌的一句，由此句可知她們的生活是怎樣了。</p>
<h3>筆底夢</h3>
<p>— 王仁東</p>
<p>——大人的童話</p>
<p>“我的筆睡熟了，在春天，做了一些美麗的夢；並且含糊的還發出來一些囈语。很好聽，有如唱隻歌；然而醒來時，大半在記憶裏褪了色，但也還可以錄下來，不過看它的時候，定要用一隻織夢底梭子，去把它稀疏了的地方，織補起來；那麼以後才可以使你看起來還是像沒有淡去的以前一樣；不然，你只好看到它這一片破碎的了！”</p>
<p>春來了：</p>
<p>在我沉寂而抑鬰的心頭，是洒來了一壺乳色的溫熱水，——且如水銀的瀉地。心是含着它而盪漾了。</p>
<p>亦或許是從牆腳下的石塊的縫隙裹里，迸出的幾莖野草，或貼上一斑青苔。</p>
<p>假如在牆腳下，爬過了一隻肥滑的蚰蜒時，或會疑心牠是載着春天的音訊，而沿途留下了它的陰影；因為那遺下了的銀色的紋路，有如開遍在沉默上，田壟上，白色的米形小花朶。</p>
<p>野草和青苔是肯蔓延的，會很快的爬滿石縫的；或做一個深密的一叢，把石子，把牆腳包藏起來。深而密了，會有更多的載着春訊的蜓蚰；有時還會有一隻毒蛇，紅眼睛，三角的頭，火熖條子的舌；那也是不一定的！</p>
<p>我想到蛇就害怕，假如春天在我心的角落裏，把一些野草和青苔也深而密的蔓延起來呢？那不會吧，也有一條毒蛇？蜓蛐倒還好，牠會畫銀色的紋路，如開米色的小花朵。小花朵是很有意思的，香而溫馨，也許有童話裏的蚱蜢或田鼠呢。</p>
<p>開點小花吧！</p>
<p>要開花得下種，下了種，想雨。雨泥溜溜的潤透了土層，土層裏的種子就進出了一粒粒的小芽，然後生葉子，長大而開花。</p>
<p>“不見陽光麼？”</p>
<p>“可以讓種子在抑鬱里陰暗的包着，盡力的抑鬱是會促進牠的心的崩潰，再伸出芽來，見見陽光吧！</p>
<p>雨也是最能使沉寂，使抑鬱的。</p>
<p>沉寂，沉寂。</p>
<p>抑鬱，抑鬱。</p>
<p>會崩潰，計發芽，會開花！</p>

<h3>The Situation in Suiyuan: Weather Changes Dramatically, Wang and Yan Change Plans to Fly to Suiyuan This Morning</h3>
<p>Wang Attends Welcome Meeting with Various Circles, Evening Engagement at Official Banquet of Shanxi Leaders, Xiong Bin and Others Arrive in Suiyuan Yesterday from Beiping</p>
<p>[Guihua] Starting from 2 PM on the 14th, a sudden wind arose, and for a time, yellow sand covered the earth, and the weather changed dramatically. Wang and Yan did not take off from Taiyuan, and a telegram came from Taiyuan at 4 PM on the 14th saying that Wang and Yan had changed their plans to come to Suiyuan on the morning of the 15th. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>[Guihua] At noon on the 14th, a sudden gale arose here, and dust and sand obscured the sky, making it impossible to see even at close range. It did not stop until the evening. Military police, gendarmes, and people from all walks of life waited at the airport for three or four hours, welcoming Wang, Yan, and Zhao's arrival. In the end, they did not come due to the strong wind. If the wind subsides on the night of the 14th, Wang, Yan, and others should be able to fly to Suiyuan on the morning of the 15th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>[Guihua] Vice Chief of Staff of the General Staff Headquarters Xiong Bin arrived in Suiyuan at noon on the 14th, representing the Executive Yuan to attend the memorial service for those killed in action. Tang Enbo, Wang Zhonglian, Wang Wanling, Li Fuying, and Chen Cheng's representative Zhuang Mingyuan, as well as the inspection group Zhang Renmin and others, arrived in the same car. Fu Zuoyi, Zhao Chengzhou, and others personally went to the station to welcome them. In the afternoon, they also held a banquet to welcome Xiong and others. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Wang will go to the Suiyuan Commissioner's Office again at 9 PM tonight to attend an official banquet with military and political leaders, and has agreed with Yan to take a plane together from Taiyuan to Suiyuan at 6 AM tomorrow morning. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>[Guihua] It is reported that Wang and Yan were scheduled to fly to Suiyuan from Taiyuan at 2 PM on the 14th. About 100,000 Mongol and Han officials and civilians gathered at the Old City South Tea House Airport to welcome them. Various circles in Suiyuan held a public banquet on the night of the 14th. At 10 AM on the 15th, a memorial service will be held at the Martyrs' Cemetery. The entire province will lower the flag to half-mast, stop entertainment, and various circles in the provincial capital will have a day off to participate in the memorial service. Yan will preside over the ceremony. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Chu Minyi said that Wang Chang's position in the Executive Yuan is not true. Because Wang's liver disease has not yet been cured, he already feels busy with his current positions. He will stay in Suiyuan for about two or three days and then return to Taiyuan and Nanjing. Wang has declined all engagements except for Yan's banquet tonight due to illness and has published an announcement to express his gratitude. Several of his followers will take the Zhengtai train tonight to return to Suiyuan via Beiping. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>[Guihua] Fu Zuoyi and Zhao Chengzhou inspected the infantry and cavalry on the morning of the 13th as a rehearsal. The parade ground can accommodate 50,000 soldiers and civilians. 10,000 troops and 20,000 civilians will participate in the parade on the 16th. All units performed well. Zeng Yanyi will be the commander-in-chief during the inspection. Dong Qiwu and Peng Yubin will be the commanders of the infantry and cavalry respectively. The two cavalry regiments of Peng's unit are camping in the suburbs, suffering greatly from the severe cold, but the soldiers are in excellent spirits. The memorial service venue is in the Martyrs' Cemetery, which is solemnly decorated. Many elegiac couplets and sacrifices have been received from all over the country. Fu Lin's eulogy has arrived in Suiyuan, which is extremely tragic. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] At 10 AM on the morning of the 14th, all circles of the Shanxi military and government held a welcome meeting for Chairman Wang at the Zisheng Hall of the Suiyuan Commissioner's Office. Yan, Zhao, and various military and political officials, as well as more than 1,000 people from various agencies, participated. The meeting ended at 11:20 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Wang visited Yan at the Suiyuan Commissioner's Office this morning at 8 AM with Chu Minyi to express his gratitude. They talked for about 30 minutes, then visited Zhao Daiwen. At about 10 AM, he went to the Suiyuan Commissioner's Office again, accompanied by Yan, Zhao, and others to the Zisheng Hall, attending a welcome meeting with various circles. Yan introduced Wang's speech. After the meeting, he returned to the hotel and had a short meeting with Zhao Pilian and others. In the afternoon, he received a telegram from Suiyuan saying that due to the strong wind, it was inconvenient to fly, so he temporarily suspended the flight and changed it to fly tomorrow morning. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Wang visited Yan at the Suiyuan Commissioner's Office tonight and talked for a long time. He had a casual meal with Yan, not an official banquet. Zhao Daiwen, Zhao Pilian, Zhu Shouguang, and others all visited Wang at the hotel tonight. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Yan's Speech at the Welcome Meeting for Wang</h3>
<p>[Taiyuan] Yan Xishan's speech at the welcome meeting for Chairman Wang was roughly as follows: "Chairman Wang Jingwei has traveled a long way to Shanxi despite his hard work. All circles in Shanxi are expressing their sincere welcome. I will report on the relationship between Mr. Jingwei and the Party and the country at the welcome meeting. Simply put, Mr. Jingwei is a veteran of the Party and the country, a follower of the late Premier, and has always been by the side of the late Premier. The success of our Party today is largely due to Mr. Jingwei's contribution. In particular, he has taken the greatest risks and suffered the greatest hardships in the history of the National Revolution, and there are obvious facts. At today's welcome meeting, in addition to expressing our welcome, we also ask Mr. Jingwei to give us instructions." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Representatives from Various Parties Leave Beiping for Suiyuan</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Yu Xuezhong, representing Li Deshan, Shen Honglie, representing Hu Xiaoxi, the Supervisory Yuan's representative Le Jingtao, and Han Fuqu's representative Guo Zhigang, all arrived in Beiping one after another a few days ago. They left for Suiyuan together on the 14th to attend the conference of soldiers who died in defending the territory. In addition, Yan Wei, the director of the Suiyuan Education Department, arrived in Beiping after finishing his official business in Nanjing and also went to Suiyuan on the 14th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>[Guihua] Chiang's representative Xiong Bin, He Yingqin's representative Yan Kuan, Chen Cheng's representative Zhuang Mingyuan, Cheng Qian's representative Fang Xian, Ma Zhanshan's representative Li Peijun, Shang Zhen's representative Lü Pusheng, and Song's representative Deng Zhexii, etc., came to Suiyuan from Beiping at noon on the 14th to pay tribute to the soldiers and civilians who died in the Anti-Japanese War. Fu Zuoyi, Li Fuying, and Zhao Chengzhou gave a public banquet to Xiong and others at noon on the 14th. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin Personally Inscribes a Funeral Plaque</h3>
<p>And Prepares a Eulogy</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The memorial service for the soldiers and civilians who died in the Suiyuan war will be held in Suiyuan on the 15th. In addition to the National Government issuing an order to lower the flag to half-mast throughout the country on the 15th, Chairman Lin has specially appointed Zhao Pilian as his representative to pay tribute. It is reported that Chairman Lin has also inscribed a plaque with the four characters "Sacrifice Life to Defend the Country" and prepared a eulogy, which has been sent. The eulogy reads: "Brave and numerous soldiers, loyal and fearless, vowed to stop the invaders and defend China. Rain and snow, hard as ice, cracked skin and fallen fingers, fought bravely and upheld justice. Bones exposed in the border town, blood smeared on the sandy Han, the spirit stirred the wind and thunder, and the light contended with the sun and the moon. The Yin Mountains are towering, the Great Wall is majestic. The cloud chariot gallops, and the soul returns!" (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek's Eulogy to the Deceased Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Chiang Kai-shek's eulogy to the soldiers who died defending Suiyuan is extremely mournful and magnificent. The text reads: "On the 15th day of March in the 26th year of the Republic of China, Chiang Chung-cheng respectfully offers incense, flowers, and clear fruits as a sacrifice to the spirits of the soldiers who died in Suiyuan. The reed catkins cover the fields, and the flying snow floats in the sky. Military reports are urgent, and the barbarians invade to the south, like a ferocious serpent with nine heads, establishing a den in the Yin Mountains. Alas, you soldiers, were entrusted with defending the border, riding horses along the Great Wall, and controlling the frontier in the desert. Sentries reported alarms, and the whale surged. You vowed to destroy Loulan and protect our territory. You fought battle after battle, advancing even as others fell. Your blood and sweat inspired courage. You followed the example of Bu Shi, who supplied the army, and Wang Qi, who died for his country, exhausting your efforts. Soldiers and civilians were united. You conquered all enemies and restored the Great Temple. Your blood and flesh burned together, and your glory will shine forever. The enemies have been killed, and victory has been achieved.

<h3>Henan Selects Drought-Resistant Spring Wheat</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute, based on past research by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, knows that there are several kinds of wheat in our country, such as Kaifeng 1240 wheat, Xuzhou Huoshaomang and No. 4 and 5 wheat, and spring wheat from Dingxian, Shanxi, and Jining. When there is severe drought in the autumn and sowing cannot be done in the winter, the above-mentioned spring wheats can be applied and sown in the spring of the following year. After harvesting in May, beans and miscellaneous grains can still be planted, without suffering significant losses. Because Henan Province suffered severe drought last autumn and it was difficult to sow in winter, and there is concern about spring famine this year, the institute is now sending personnel to select 100 counties in the province, handling this spring wheat in each county, which can save one piece of farmland for the people to imitate and promote.

<h3>Large-Scale Paulownia Planting in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>Oil Refinery to be Completed in Wuhu</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Anhui Province is mountainous and suitable for afforestation, and the paulownia planting industry is particularly important. Therefore, the provincial authorities have instructed their subordinates to vigorously promote it. As a result, the paulownia planting work in the province has made rapid progress, and the output of oil has also increased day by day. At present, the paulownia oil produced in Guichi, Dongliu, and Zhide counties in southern Anhui, and Shucheng, Lu'an, and Hefei counties in northern Anhui is of the best quality. In the past, all of it was transported by Wuhu merchants to Shanghai and Hankou for refining and export. The market price has been rising year by year, and paulownia planters have made substantial profits. Currently, production and marketing are being actively promoted according to the established plan. Regarding production, the government advocates from above, and the people are happy to follow suit. Now, the Construction Department has designated a stretch of barren mountains along the Wuhu-Tunxi Road, extending 400 kilometers, as a paulownia forest field, and appointed Li Guangcan and Bao Yin to prepare everything. In addition, prominent figures in the industrial and commercial circles of Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhu, such as Yue Guoting, have jointly raised 30,000 yuan to establish the Kunlun Agricultural and Forestry Experimental Field, planting paulownia trees extensively at the foot of Mount Huangshan. The plan is to plant a total of one million trees within four years, which can be achieved by 1940. The annual income is expected to reach approximately 35,000 yuan, and the principal can be recovered. By the seventh year, the profit could be more than ten times the investment. This kind of paulownia planting business, with low capital and high profit, should have considerable development in Anhui Province due to its suitable terrain. Regarding marketing, after the provincial government increased its shares in the Tung Oil Materials Company, Wuhu has established an office in Anhui. The Ministry of Industry has specially appointed agricultural economics expert Cui Shushi to come and preside over the investigation of the production and sales of tung oil in the north and south. It is believed that it is possible to establish a factory in Wuhu to concentrate refining. The oil materials head office has dispatched technician Guan Shijun to Wuhu to be responsible for inspection work. On the one hand, the Anhui Local Bank will allocate 250,000 yuan from the provincial share funds to purchase oil refining machinery. The oil factory has also been surveyed and is being built near the Taikoo Wharf on the Wuhu River, with construction scheduled to be completed within two months, so as to start refining when the paulownia seeds are harvested.

<p>Tokyo Correspondence</p>
<h3>Japanese Views on the Suiyuan War</h3>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>Since November 15th of last year, when the Inner Mongolian army, with modern weapons such as airplanes, tanks, and armored vehicles, attacked Suiyuan, four months have passed. In these four months, how much blood has been shed, and how many Inner Mongolian and Suiyuan soldiers have been sacrificed—who can say that these soldiers and this blood do not belong to the Chinese nation?</p>
<p>Because China and Japan are friendly nations—and are said to be particularly close friendly nations—there have been frequent comments in Tokyo regarding this issue since the outbreak of the Suiyuan War. Among these comments, the texts regarding the resources of Inner Mongolia and the "Inner Mongolian people" are the most brilliant and important.</p>
<p>To introduce these matters to the people of our country is a long-held intention of this writer. However, the issue is sensitive and difficult to discuss, so I have started and stopped writing an unknown number of times. However, the issue will not be forgotten by those who are concerned. On the 21st of this month (February), at the 70th Japanese Diet's budget general meeting, Minister of War Sugiyama gave a response to the Diet members regarding the Suiyuan issue.</p>
<p>Why did Minister of War Sugiyama not explain the Suiyuan issue at other meetings, but rather at the budget general meeting? Regarding this, I cannot say much. What I can do now is to select several important paragraphs from the texts published in Tokyo regarding the Suiyuan War and present them below. Readers can judge for themselves what is right and wrong.</p>
<p>(II) Excerpts from Japanese Opinions</p>
<p>First, let me copy the comments published by Tokyo's leading newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, in early December of last year.</p>
<p>"The Mongolian region is very rich in animal husbandry, mining, salt extraction, and natural soda ash. Animal husbandry is the only industry of the Mongolians, but the methods used are still very primitive. From Fengzhen County in Suiyuan Province north to Baotou is a famous wool producing area: the export volume is more than 80 to 90 million catties per year. Although the reserves of coal account for only 0.2% of the total coal reserves in China, the reserves of iron ore are no less than those of any other place in China. In Xuanhua County, Chahar alone, the reserves are more than 90 million tons. The salt production of Inner Mongolia is also several hundred thousand catties per year. The annual output of natural soda ash in Chahar is about 8,000 tons, while Suiyuan produces more than 40 million dan per year. Salt and natural soda ash are the main sources of wealth in Inner Mongolia.</p>
<p>"The only industry in the two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan that can be considered industrial is the fur processing factory in Suiyuan. Although agriculture is very backward, the paddy fields that were cultivated under the Northwest China Development Plan in 1934 have reached 3.3 million mu, and dry land has reached 32 million mu. If this independence movement is successful, under appropriate guidance and assistance, and a solid development plan is established, and it is further related to the progress of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China, the future of Inner Mongolia can be expected."</p>
<p>Next, let me copy the comments published by the Yomiuri Shimbun in late November of last year:</p>
<p>"Regarding the war clouds in eastern Suiyuan, Japan has three reasons why it cannot sit idly by: First, Suiyuan and Chahar are the areas that are in the path of the Soviet Union's western route to China, and an important northern red route. Second, 'Manchukuo' is adjacent to the Inner Mongolian area. Ethnically speaking, the Inner Mongolian race is the same race as the Mongols in 'Manchukuo'. Now, this race is being drawn into the dangerous tide of redization. Third, realizing the liberation of the Mongolian people is an important focus of Japan's continental policy."</p>
<p>Enough, let's stop copying here. There is too much material, and it is impossible to copy it all. Anyway, the general meaning is similar. As long as the people of our country carefully understand it, the mysteries of these arguments are not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>(III) Epilogue</p>
<p>The Suiyuan War is currently at a standstill, but what the future holds is questionable. Now the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee has already adjourned. In response to the declaration of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi made the following remarks in the Diet on the 22nd of this month:</p>
<p>"The Imperial Government respects China's territorial sovereignty and hopes that China will achieve complete administrative unification. However, North China is the border area between Japan, 'Manchukuo', and China, and is the region where the political and economic interests of the three countries are most intertwined. Regarding the movements of the North China regime, the Imperial Government cannot but pay great attention to them at any time."</p>
<p>At the same time, Minister of War Sugiyama gave the following explanation in the Diet regarding the outline of the "Five-Year Development Plan for Manchurian Industry":</p>
<p>"...The content of the plan includes the mining, industrial, agricultural, livestock, transportation, and communication sectors, but its main focus is on promoting important industries based on the principle of adapting to local conditions. At the same time, it also attempts to stabilize the economic life of 'Manchukuo' economically. In addition, it plans national harmony and seeks ways to make it easier and more convenient for Japanese people to migrate to Manchuria...!"</p>
<p>Regarding the remarks of Prime Minister Hayashi and the Minister of War, I can only fulfill my responsibility to introduce them to the people of our country. What criticisms and opinions there are, the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom. There are different views on both sides, China and Japan. What needs to be pointed out here is that the "continental policy" will definitely not change. Under the guidance of completing the "continental policy" strategy, although there are differences in rhetoric and actions today, the important factors in the backbone are only differences in tactics, not changes in content. Therefore:</p>
<p>Over one mountain after another, over one sea after another! The so-called "border area" will be endless. Moreover, the meaning and application of "nation" is very broad. Within the territory of the Chinese nation, it can be divided into Han, Mongolian, Hui...etc., but under the name of the so-called "East Asian Leader" and "East Asian Co-prosperity," it can greatly advocate something like "national harmony." But what is the so-called "national harmony" after all? The facts are before our eyes, and I think there is no need to explain it further. (February 23rd)</p>

<h3>The New Locarno Pact Problem</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>It has been more than a year since Hitler announced the abolition of the Locarno Pact and sent troops into the Rhineland area on March 7th of last year. During this year, Europe has been in a state of no treaty, and has felt very insecure. In Western Europe, there have been the following developments. First, the United Kingdom presented a questionnaire to Germany, asking Hitler about his intentions after the abolition of the treaty. Herr Hitler shelved it and did not reply. And the reply that was later expressed in fact was the unlimited expansion of armaments and the repeated demands for the recovery of colonies. Second, Belgium suddenly announced on October 14th of last year that it would restore its pre-war neutral policy and abandon its alliance relationship with France. Third, France, feeling the increasing threat from Germany, has increased the construction of the Maginot Line, extending it to the borders of Belgium and Switzerland. But despite this military defense, France has never been able to dispel its concerns about the German armed threat.</p>
<p>The insecurity in Western Europe is a problem that is jointly worried about by Britain and France. Because of this, Britain's relationship with Germany is now much cooler. And Britain and France have taken a consistent stance on issues such as those relating to Belgium and Spain. Not long ago, British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in a speech in Parliament that the United Kingdom should still provide assistance in accordance with the responsibilities of the Locarno Pact if France and Belgium were attacked by aggressors. However, at the same time, because Germany had unilaterally abolished this pact, the United Kingdom also sent letters to the German and Italian governments, proposing to conclude a new Locarno Pact.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 13th, after a long period of expectation after the British letter was sent out, a reply was finally received on the 13th. This reply was obviously issued after joint consultations between Germany and Italy. There is nothing special in it. In addition to vaguely stating that they are willing to jointly maintain the stability of Western Europe, the two concrete points expressed in the German reply are: one is to maintain the Franco-German border, which is jointly guaranteed by Britain and Italy; and the other is that Germany still does not change its opposition to the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact.</p>
<p>Judging from the attitude of the German and Italian replies, the conclusion of this new Western European Locarno Pact still has little hope and is not easy to realize. Germany and Italy have adopted a consistent and tough attitude towards the Locarno Pact issue since they concluded an agreement last year. This is the first difficulty. Second, the Rhineland demilitarized zone has been abolished, and the Franco-German border has returned to the state of armed confrontation before the European War. At this time, Germany is only giving an empty promise to guarantee the maintenance of the border, which is just as unreliable as Germany's guarantee of Belgium's neutrality before the war. Third, Germany's opposition to the Franco-Soviet Pact was originally a pretext for abolishing the Locarno Pact. But since the establishment of the German-Italian and German-Japanese alliance pacts, the anti-Soviet attitude of these countries has become more intense than before. However, at the same time, since the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations and expressed its support for the European collective security system, the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union has greatly improved. In the autumn, Eden's speech even stated that the United Kingdom can no longer exclude the Soviet Union from European diplomacy in the future. Then Germany and Italy continuing to insist on their opposition to the Franco-Soviet Pact in the conclusion of the new Locarno Pact is of course also a big difficulty.</p>
<p>These difficulties not only show that the Western European Pact hoped for by the United Kingdom is not easy to realize at present, but also shows that the entire situation in Europe has little hope of stability. Because "peace is indivisible" is indeed a wise saying. At a time when aggressors are actively active and the situation in Central Europe and Spain is extremely dangerous, it is really very difficult to maintain the stability of one corner of Western Europe.</p>
<h3>The Bank of Korea's Expanding Influence in China</h3>
<p>Decides to Acquire Japanese-owned Shanghai Bank, Capital to Increase to Two Million Yuan</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Bank of Korea has decided to acquire the Shanghai Bank Co., Ltd., which is operated by Japanese national, Hasegawa Kahei. This matter will be formally announced after the Shanghai Bank shareholders hold a meeting on the 20th to make a decision. The current capital of the Shanghai Bank is 100,000 yuan, which will be increased to 2 million yuan (Japanese currency). Most of the investment will be borne by the Bank of Korea. From then on, the Bank of Korea will initially plan to develop activities in the Yangtze River basin. After the Bank of Korea acquired the Zhenglong Bank in Tianjin and Qingdao last year, its influence in North China has gradually increased. Now, the bank plans to work hard to open up new areas in Central China and South China. (Central News Agency, 14th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister's Diplomatic Speech Met with Criticism from Right-wing Groups</h3>
<p>Said to Lack Understanding of the Current Situation, Sato's Position May be Shaken</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The uproar caused by Foreign Minister Sato Naotake's speech has not yet subsided. The Far Right's Toho-kai (Oriental Society) and Kokumin Domei (National League) originally intended to submit a motion of no confidence, but because the number of proponents lacked six people and did not reach the legal amount, they could not submit it. However, the two factions issued a statement, pointing out that Sato lacked a fundamental understanding of the current situation and demanded that Sato resign immediately to express his apology to the people of the country. In addition, the right-wing Jikyoku Kyougikai (Current Affairs Consultative Council) also issued a declaration, accusing Sato of being a "liberalist who opposes national policy" and demanding that Sato and Hayashi Senjuro resign at the same time, because Hayashi Senjuro recommended Sato as Foreign Minister. Five right-wing Diet members had an audience with Prime Minister Hayashi and Minister of War Sugiyama, and warned them about Sato's speech. For this reason, whether Sato can remain in his position is a very big question. At present, there is much speculation about the possibility that Sato will submit his resignation amidst this fierce wave. (Central News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Plans to Establish National Policy Integration Agency</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The national policy integration agency that the government is trying to establish is based on the current Cabinet Investigation Agency and reorganizes its contents. Therefore, it is feared that the merger of the Statistics Bureau, the Resources Bureau, etc., will hinder its activities. It is making every effort to concentrate the capabilities of the agency in order to achieve the purpose of investigating national policy. The new agency does not expand its powers in terms of its official system, and although its appearance is small-scale, its operation is quite important. That is, when important national policies are decided, the act of each minister requesting a Cabinet decision is seriously excluded. All important national policies cannot be submitted to the Cabinet for formal decision unless the new agency's deliberations produce a comprehensive and concrete outline. The new agency is the Prime Minister's advisory body and is in close contact with the Minister of Finance to avoid friction when compiling the budget. (Dōmei News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Yuki's Policy on Digesting Public Bonds</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The planned amount of public bonds to be issued in the 1937 budget reaches 913 million yuan for both general and special accounts. If 50 million yuan is added to the supplementary budget, the total amount of public bonds issued in 1937 will be 960 million yuan. How the government will deal with this huge amount of public bonds has attracted much attention. According to Finance Minister Yuki's explanation in the current Diet, the fundamental policy seems to be as follows to deal with public bonds: ㊀ Digesting public bonds should take accumulating capital and maintaining national credit as its foundation. ㊁ Excessive speculation hinders the digestion of public bonds, so appropriate countermeasures should be studied, and the people should be asked to exercise self-restraint. ㊂ Regarding the policy of reducing interest rates and the policy of controlling finance, artificial means should be excluded. ㊃ As a method of issuing public bonds, for the sake of popularization, they should be retailed by each post office.

<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Commemorates the Promulgation of the Five Charter Oath</h3>
<p>Resolution to Strive to Promote Constitutional Government</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives today commemorated the 70th anniversary of the Meiji Emperor's promulgation of the Five Charter Oath. A meeting was held at 10:30 a.m., with government cabinet members and all members of the Diet wearing formal attire. First, Speaker Tomita declared that today is the 70th anniversary of the promulgation of the Five Charter Oath, and this House is holding a special meeting to decide on a resolution. Next, Koizumi Matajiro and 44 other Diet members jointly submitted "The matter of commemorating the 70th anniversary of the promulgation of the Five Charter Oath." Okada Tadahiko represented the various factions to explain its contents, and everyone stood up and paid their respects, reciting the Five Charter Oath and the Imperial Rescript. The Speaker briefly said that today is the anniversary of the 70th anniversary of the promulgation of the Five Charter Oath. Thinking about the achievements of the senior officials who devoted themselves to establishing constitutional government, forgetting their families and years, and reviewing the current state of the Diet, we feel an even greater responsibility. We must work hard to expand the provisions of the Constitution and carry out administration, to live up to the expectations of the Holy Emperor and the people. After Speaker Tomita finished speaking, he asked for a vote. At this time, everyone unanimously stood up to approve the resolution. The meeting adjourned at 10:45 a.m. (Dōmei News Agency, 14th)</p>

<h3>Snowstorms Cause Disaster in the British Isles</h3>
<p>Snow in Ireland Reaches the Roofs</p>
<p>[London] The British Isles have been hit by snowstorms for the past week, and yesterday's heavy snow in Ireland was unprecedented in the lives of the elderly. Two Belfast mail cars were lost due to snow; although search teams have set out, there are no roads to be found in the wind. In some places, the snow is already level with the roofs. In Belfast, the snow is two feet deep, and all traffic has been suspended. Snowstorms in Berwickshire have continued for four days. Hundreds of sheep have been trapped in the snow and have suffocated to death. Train schedules in Scotland have also been affected. Before the train can run, a snowplow must clear the way before it can pass. The train between Edinburgh and Galashiels was blocked by snow 12 feet deep and half a mile long and could not move forward. Many flights have also been suspended. Although the south of England is not as severe as the north, climate forecasts report that winter is not over yet and that rain and snow will continue to fall.

<h3>The Western Government Sends a Note to the League of Nations Protesting Italy and Germany's Participation in the War</h3>
<p>Enumerating Facts to Prove Infringement of Sovereignty and Urging Britain to Take Swift Emergency Measures</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the matter of Italian regular troops assisting the Spanish Nationalist army in combat, the Secretariat of the League of Nations has distributed the note submitted by the Spanish Republican government's Foreign Minister, Alvarez del Vayo, to all member states. The content elaborates on the confessions made by Italian prisoners captured on the Guadalajara front, especially Major Sherrif. According to the confessions, a large number of Italian troops, fully armed and with ample supplies, were transported to Spain by several Italian steamships of the "Sicilia" line. They landed in Cádiz in the south on February 6, concentrated in Santander, and were subsequently transferred to the Guadalajara province to participate in the war. This force consisted of four divisions, all mechanized regular troops, namely the "Littorio" Division and the First, Second, and Third Divisions of the Fascist Blackshirts, forming a single army. The commander-in-chief was General Mencarelli, with headquarters in the city of Argora. The Third Blackshirt Division was commanded by General Nuvolini, with headquarters in the town of Briviesca. The "Littorio" Division was commanded by General Bergonzoli, with headquarters in Almatrone. There were also two special brigades, one composed of regular troops from both Italy and Germany, and the other composed of German regular troops and four battalions of Italian mechanized infantry. Each regiment in the aforementioned divisions had a platoon of trench mortars, a company of 45mm mountain guns, a platoon of 65mm field guns, a company of 75mm anti-aircraft guns, and a battalion of 25mm tanks totaling fifty vehicles, along with seventy trucks. Furthermore, two more army divisions are scheduled to arrive soon. Regarding the rebel air force, there were three squadrons of German aircraft and four squadrons of Italian fighters and one squadron of bombers. The plan set by the rebel headquarters was for the naval forces of Italy and Germany to use the pretext of monitoring the Spanish Navy to shell the cities of Valencia and Barcelona. At the same time, the rebels would take the opportunity to attack and occupy the city of Madrid. In conclusion, the Spanish note stated that all these actions constitute an infringement of Spanish territorial integrity and sovereignty, and are a repetition and escalation of the dictatorships' repeated violations of international law. This is tantamount to an undeclared war. The Spanish government believes that since the establishment of the League of Nations, the violation of the Covenant on the European continent is the most serious in this instance. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from Havana, 13th)</p>
<p>[London] The Spanish Ambassador to Britain, Azcárate, delivered a note from his government to the British Foreign Office this afternoon, lodging a request with the British government regarding the Italian government's dispatch of regular troops to participate in the Spanish Civil War. The first part of the note is identical in wording to the note sent to the League of Nations the other day. The second part states, "Even if the non-intervention monitoring system for the Spanish internal unrest is fully implemented, merely implementing the monitoring system alone cannot fundamentally resolve this issue (referring to the participation of Italian regular troops in the civil war). This must rely on some countries, based on honor and a sense of responsibility, directly cooperating and taking action." The Spanish government finally requested that the British government use its influence to urge the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee to immediately discuss the points raised by the Spanish government and to take an urgent decision on "the true nature of the Italian government's armed assistance to the Spanish rebels." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from Havana, 13th)</p>
<p>[London] The Spanish government submitted a note to the British Foreign Office yesterday, stating that the Italian regular army's assistance to the rebel army in that country has increased unabatedly, and that Italy and Spain are almost at war. British diplomatic circles have recently declared that such a statement could have serious implications internationally. The British government does not intend to consider it. Foreign Secretary Eden has declared to the Valencia government that after the implementation of the monitoring plan, the participation of other countries in the Spanish Civil War can be prevented. Observers also said that the British government is now fully considering the issue of a new Locarno Pact and has no time for other matters. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from Havana, 14th)</p>
<h3>The Spanish Government Army Counterattacks on the Guadalajara Front</h3>
<p>Surprise Attack Recaptures Key Town, Many Italian Soldiers Captured</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid The government army authorities issued a communiqué at noon today, stating that the town of Trijueque on the Guadalajara front northeast of the capital has been recaptured by the government army. When the militia belonging to the government army counterattacked, it was supported by the air force and artillery. They immediately seized a large number of weapons, including six artillery pieces and two anti-aircraft guns, and captured many Italian soldiers. Twelve other Italian soldiers surrendered themselves. In addition, after a fierce attack by the rebel army on the Jarama River front southeast of the capital, they advanced towards the town of Puente Largo. However, the militia belonging to the government army immediately counterattacked and completely recaptured the lost positions. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from Havana, 14th)</p>
<p>⊙ Guadalajara A special dispatch from our correspondent accompanying the army: Yesterday, the government army launched a fierce attack on the town of Trijueque, which was occupied by the Nationalist army, and occupied it after a fierce battle of forty-five minutes. The strategy adopted by the government army this morning was to use thirty tanks as a vanguard, and to send two columns of militia to advance along different routes. One advanced along the plain from two kilometers outside the town, and the other advanced through a forest from five kilometers outside the town. When the first column reached the entrance of the village, the second column had unexpectedly outflanked the enemy army, reaching the rear of the village. The Nationalist army in the village was caught off guard and fled in panic. The government army pursued them until two kilometers outside the village before retreating. The Nationalist army abandoned many weapons in this battle. It is said that since the beginning of the civil war, the government army has obtained the most spoils of war in this battle. In addition, although the bad weather yesterday hindered air force operations, government aircraft were still able to bomb the Nationalist army's lines and drop many photos of the Italian prisoners captured by the government army, with the Italian words "Our army does not execute prisoners" added to them. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from Havana, 14th)</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid The air force commander of this city recently declared that several government army aircraft had bombed several divisions of the Italian army belonging to the rebel army on the Guadalajara front in the northeast this afternoon, with great success. These divisions have already been forced to retreat. In addition, our correspondent, Rolling, learned that the government army on the Guadalajara front launched an offensive today to prevent the Nationalist army from advancing. The Nationalist army retreated five kilometers along the Aragon highway and abandoned a large number of weapons. Currently, the government army headquarters is confident that the government army has received assistance from new forces, its strength has greatly increased, and it will soon be able to recover the lost territory of the past few days. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from Havana, 13th)</p>
<p>⊙ Sigüenza (in the hands of the Nationalist army) A special dispatch from our correspondent: The Guadalajara front is experiencing wind and rain, and visibility is poor, so the Nationalist army has not been able to advance. It is rumored that the town of Trijueque has been captured by the government army. General Llano, the commander of the Nationalist army's southern route, recently issued a broadcast message from Seville denying this. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from Havana, 14th)</p>
<p>⊙ Guadalajara Province Front line, a special dispatch from our correspondent. Yesterday, the sky was overcast, which was unfavorable for flying, but aircraft belonging to the Nationalist army still dropped bombs on the areas along the Aragon Avenue and the Jarama River east of Madrid, where the government army was concentrated, and did so all day long. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from Havana, 13th)</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid In the fighting on the Guadalajara and Jarama fronts, both the government army and the Nationalist army are claiming victory. The government side announced today that "today has unfolded a glorious page in the history of the defense of Madrid." The Italian army attacking in the Guadalajara area suffered heavy losses from the government army's air force during its retreat, and intercepted all of the enemy's military supplies in Trijueque, 45 miles from the capital, adding that the reason for the government army's victory was partly because the government's reinforcements were arriving continuously, while the Nationalist army had been fighting hard for four days and was exhausted. However, the Nationalist army side, in a message released from Salamanca, said that Madrid had become isolated and helpless, and could be taken at any moment, because Guadalajara, the key transportation route between Madrid and the sea, was under attack by the Nationalist army on three routes, and has occupied countless villages, and Guadalajara has been surrounded.

<h3>Britain Plans to First Resolve the Issue of Belgian Neutrality</h3>
<p>Then Negotiate a New Locarno Treaty, Italy's Reply Contains Three Main Points</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden is now scheduled to meet with the ambassadors of France, Belgium, Germany, and Italy separately in the middle of next week to discuss the two issues of a new Locarno Pact and Belgium's neutral status. Responsible parties have recently confirmed that the British government now intends to resolve the issue of Belgium's neutral status first, and then conduct negotiations on a new Locarno Pact, so that Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland can be satisfied before the by-election for the Chamber of Representatives in Brussels (referring to the election in which the Prime Minister competes with Degrelle, the leader of the country's Fascist party). However, the future of the issue of Belgium's neutral status still has many difficulties. First, Belgium wants to prohibit foreign troops from passing through Belgium, which is contrary to the obligations stated in Section 3 of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant (referring to the obligation of League of Nations member states to grant the convenience of passage to other member states when military sanctions are in effect). Second, Britain is eager to maintain the agreement established by the British, French, and Belgian general staffs (which was established last year after Germany abolished the Locarno Pact, and its content stipulates methods for the three countries' general staffs to cooperate), so that Belgium can notify them when foreign aircraft fly over Belgian airspace. Political figures in London have also commented on the memorandums from Italy and Germany regarding the new Locarno Pact, believing that if France and Germany promise not to engage in war with each other, and Britain and Italy guarantee it, it is tantamount to the revival of the Four-Power Pact of 1933. If so, the small countries of Europe will inevitably feel uneasy. In addition, regarding the attitude adopted by Germany towards the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, although it is no longer as completely negative as before, it still demands the modification of some clauses in the pact and the abolition of the automatic, mechanical mutual assistance measures. This is hardly sufficient to facilitate future negotiations. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from Havana, 13th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the issue of a future Western European Pact, the Italian government submitted a memorandum to Britain yesterday, in response to Britain's second note. However, because Britain's second note and France's reply are still being kept secret and have not been published, Italy's memorandum cannot be published temporarily either. However, according to sources, Italy's memorandum contains the following three main points:</p>
<p>㊀ The 1925 Locarno Pact had great effect. Italy is now prepared to negotiate a future Western European Pact in accordance with the outline of this pact, but all new factors, such as Germany re-establishing defenses along the Rhine River, should be taken into account. ㊁ The wording of the future Western European Pact must be clear and precise, so that the procedures are simple and fast when implemented. ㊂ Regarding the issue of Belgium's territorial integrity, Italy is prepared to provide the same guarantee as Britain, France, and Germany. In addition, it is heard that Italy's memorandum mentioned the relationship between the future Western European Pact and the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, but responsible parties have said that "all new factors should be taken into account," and its meaning should be that the future Western European Pact and the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact are not completely contradictory.

<h3>Germany and Italy Send Copies of Replies to Britain to the Belgian Government</h3>
<p>⊙ Brussels Regarding the issue of a new Locarno Pact, the memorandums from the governments of Germany and Italy in reply to Britain, in addition to being delivered to British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson, and British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Eric Drummond, yesterday, were also delivered in duplicate to the Belgian Ambassador to Germany and the Chargé d'affaires in Italy, respectively, for transmission to the Belgian government.

<h3>French Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Attends to Report on the Contents of the German Memorandum</p>
<p>[Paris] The Cabinet held a meeting this afternoon, chaired by President Lebrun. Foreign Minister Delbos presented the contents of the German memorandum regarding the new Locarno Pact to the Council of State, and also gave a technical report on the application of the Non-Intervention Monitoring Plan for the Spanish Civil War. In addition, French Ambassador to Britain Corbin has returned here from London and will report the British reaction to the German memorandum to the Foreign Minister. Regarding this memorandum, French political figures pointed out that although the path of future negotiations has not been closed, the views held by Germany have not changed fundamentally. Also, Germany only wants Britain to be a guarantor country and does not want it to be a guaranteed country, and insists that the "operating situation" (referring to whether the mutual assistance treaty has reached the point of application) of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact should be approved by the British and Italian guarantor countries. The intention is to abolish the mechanical nature of mutual assistance, but the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact does not actually have automatic mechanicality. According to the pact, the Council of the League of Nations should first determine the aggressor country. Assuming that the Council cannot reach a unanimous decision, France then has the freedom to implement mutual assistance measures. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from Havana, 13th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the issue of a new Locarno Treaty, political figures recently commented on the various key points in the German government's memorandum as reported in the newspapers, saying that the most noteworthy points in the German memorandum are two: first, Germany opposes making Britain both a guarantor country and a guaranteed country, and insists that according to the provisions of the old Locarno Pact, Britain can only unilaterally guarantee the safety of France and Germany; second, Germany opposes all mutual assistance pacts signed within the scope of the League of Nations Covenant. According to the agreement signed by Britain, France, and Belgium on March 19, 1936, after Germany unilaterally abolished the Locarno Treaty, the provisions of the old Locarno Treaty were maintained and continued to be valid. The agreement stipulates that Britain is both a guarantor country and a guaranteed country, which is very different from the German view. Moreover, the German reply obliterates one of the main clauses in the old treaty, according to which the right to decide whether a signatory country has a reason to send troops to assist belongs to the Council of the League of Nations. However, Germany is now proposing that in the new treaty, the British and Italian guarantor countries should jointly decide the reason for sending troops to assist, which is also very different from the Covenant.

<h3>Russian Ambassador to Britain Praises Soviet Military Might</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky gave a speech in London the other day, praising the Soviet Union's military might. Neither the official side nor the newspapers here have commented on it yet, but officials have declared that Maisky's public declaration is sufficient to prove that Germany's fear of the Soviet Union harming peace is not without basis. But in any case, Germany has no intention of attacking the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the Frankfurter Zeitung replied that Germany has no intention of seeking freedom of action in Eastern Europe in the Western European agreement negotiations, because if Germany wants to have freedom of action in Eastern Europe, it should ask France to abolish the Eastern European treaties, but France has never mentioned this request. Maisky's speech stated that the danger of anti-Sovietism has increased, and that the German-Japanese agreement is not a military alliance against the Soviet Union, but that the Soviet Union's military strength today is sufficient to deal with a joint attack by any country or several countries alone.

<h3>Inskip's Speech Outlines Britain's Goal for Military Buildup</h3>
<p>Working Hand in Hand with the United States to Safeguard World Peace</p>
<p>[London] Minister for Coordination of Defence Sir Thomas Inskip said in a speech in Cambridge last night that he hoped that the advocacy of peace by overseas politicians was as sincere as he intended to believe. Everyone in Britain feels that Britain's military buildup is by no means out of malice to undermine world peace, but in reality is for the purpose of maintaining peace, hoping to place peace on a solid foundation. Britain's role as a builder of this foundation has long been evident. In 1914, the British Admiralty still had to take into account the strength of the US Navy, but today, the British have no doubts about the US Navy and its army, only regarding them as sister forces dedicated to defending world peace. The knight next mentioned the market price of metals needed for military equipment, explaining that he was pleased to hear that tin prices had fallen recently. As for the high prices of metals, it may actually be due to speculators who saw the government's rearmament program and took the opportunity to manipulate them, but this is not the case. The copper needed for the rearmament program accounts for only 10% of the copper needed by all industries in the country. The real reason is that world production is short, demand exceeds supply, so prices have risen. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from Havana, 13th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] In the first year of the British government without a treaty, at a time when world naval powers are competing to build ships, the special dispatch of Mr. Craigie, who is proficient in naval disarmament issues, as ambassador to Japan can be regarded as Britain's start to laying the groundwork for future disarmament conferences, i.e. Craigie's visit to Japan is the same as the role played by Sir Cushendun, who went to the United States as ambassador to the United States before the opening of the London conference (14th, Domei dispatch)</p>

<h3>American Electrical Giant Dr. Thomson Dies</h3>
<p>Ranking Alongside Edison, Bush, and Others, His Most Important Invention Was Electric Welding, He Held Over Seven Hundred Patents in the US</p>
<p>⊙ Swampscott, Massachusetts</p>
<p>Elihu Thomson, one of the world's greatest inventors, died here today at the age of 83. Thomson was born in England, and as a child, he followed his parents to America, living in Philadelphia, where he studied physics and chemistry, especially excelling in electricity. His most important invention was electric welding. The General Electric Company of America holds over seven hundred patents, all the result of Thomson's inventions. However, Edison had more success, so Thomson's reputation was overshadowed by him. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from Havana, 13th)</p>
<p>⊙ Swampscott, Massachusetts Dr. Thomson, the inventor of the electric locomotive, died here today. He, Edison, Bush, and Wood were the four giants of the American electrical engineering field. Thomson, in his early years, electrical engineering was still in its infancy, and in his later years it became the world's largest industry. However, Thomson was tireless, and on the day of his death, he was still engaged in experiments. Thomson was born in Manchester, England, and came to America at the age of five. His father was also an engineering expert, so he inherited his genes and was extremely intelligent. He made many inventions throughout his life, the most famous of which were ㊀ alternating current transformation, using transformers to distribute high-voltage power; ㊁ watt-hour meter to calculate electricity consumption; ㊂ alternating current induction motor, which is very important for industry; ㊃ method of generating electric waves, which is now used in radio; ㊄ electric welding; ㊅ electric locomotive, etc. He received fifteen scientific medals, and in the United States alone, seven hundred trademarks belonged to Thomson.

<h3>Austrian Chancellor Scheduled to Visit Hungary in Return</h3>
<p>Discussing the Issue of Restoration</p>
<p>⊙ Vienna State Chancellor Schuschnigg is scheduled to visit Hungary on the 19th of this month, and President Miklas is scheduled to follow in April. At that time, they will both be able to take the opportunity to discuss the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg former royal family. Although this has been publicly opposed by Italian semi-officials, the actions of royalists in Austria and Hungary have shown a simultaneous trend of evolution, making the talks to be conducted by the authorities of the two countries extremely important. The Weltpresse recently commented, "Foreign parties often believe that Italy, influenced by Germany, is opposed to the restoration of the Habsburg royal family, but the Rome Protocol established by Italy, Austria, and Hungary is aimed at the affairs of the three related countries, not the two related countries. Although Italy opposes Austria's restoration, Hungary also has the right to speak, and moreover, that country is a pillar resisting both left and right extremes, just like Austria."

<h3>Turkish President to Visit Romania</h3>
<p>⊙ Romanian Capital Foreign Minister Antonescu is scheduled to travel to the Turkish capital tomorrow. Well-informed sources have recently declared that Turkish President Kemal will soon visit Romania. The Foreign Minister's trip is to consult with the Turkish authorities on reception arrangements.

<h3>The Pain of Abyssinia's King Losing His Country</h3>
<p>⊙ Bath, England. Since the Emperor of Abyssinia took up residence in England, he only left London yesterday to come and visit here. When speaking to a reporter from this newspaper, he said, "The hopes of the Abyssinian people and the Emperor are still placed on the League of Nations. Although there have been many disappointing aspects in the past, we still find it difficult to believe that the various principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant have completely failed. We are willing to accept any solution that the British and French may propose regarding the future of our country, as long as it is based on the foundation of legal principles. Although General [Ras] Desta's resistance in the western part of our country failed and he was brutally murdered, the resistance of our nation has not ended as a result. For example, the assassination attempt on Italian Governor-General Graziani in Addis Ababa recently shows that the invaders are not safe even in the capital." It is reported that the Abyssinian Emperor is currently writing a memoir to recount the facts of the Italian invasion. (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Impending Divorce of the Morrisons Set to Become a Reality</h3>
<p>[London] The rumor that the famous British flying couple, Amy Johnson and Jim Mollison, are about to separate is becoming increasingly true. Amy Johnson has instructed her representative in London to announce that she has filed for divorce, and stated that she has many future flying plans, but will carry them out under the name of "Amy Johnson." Mollison also stated that he has agreed to his wife filing for divorce, as Amy will be operating in France and will establish a new company there, while Mollison himself will be operating between England and America. Mollison further hinted that he and his wife may be opponents in the Franco-American air race in August of this year. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Completion of the Cemetery for the Gengzi Martyrs, Including Tang Caichang</h3>
<p>Wang penned the inscription, recounting the uprising.</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The martyrs Tang Caichang, Fu Cixiang, Lin Gui, and others launched an uprising in Wuchang in the Gengzi year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing dynasty, but were killed after the failure of the uprising. Previously, Ju Zheng, Shi Ying, and others had petitioned the central government for funds to build a public cemetery and appointed Li Fanyi, Wang Xinggong, Zhou Gengsheng, and others as members of the cemetery construction committee. Construction began near Donghu Middle School on Luojia Mountain in the 24th year [of the Republic]. It is now completed. The cemetery construction committee held a public memorial ceremony at the cemetery on the 12th of this month. Representatives from all walks of life in Wuhan participated. President Jiang of the Executive Yuan specially sent Huang Shaohong as a representative to offer sacrifices. Relatives of the martyrs who came to Hubei to participate in the ceremony included Tang Yiren, the eldest grandson of Tang Caichang; Chuan Yangsun and Yun Sun, the sons of martyr Fu Cixiang; and Lin Shouhu, the son of martyr Lin Gui. The cemetery inscription was written by Wang Zhaoming and calligraphed by Zhang Nanxian. Chairman Lin of the National Government erected a memorial stele in front of the tomb. The texts of the two steles are recorded below:</p>
<p>Tombstone of the Gengzi Wuchang Uprising Martyrs: "On the twenty-eighth day of the seventh month of the Gengzi year, the Self-Reliance Society launched an uprising in Wuchang, and twenty people were captured and killed by Qing officials: Tang Caichang of Liuyang, Fu Cixiang of Qianjiang, Lin Gui of Xiangyin, Li Ke of Guangdong, Huang Zifu, Cai Chengyu of Tianjin, Zheng Baocheng of Fujian, Tian Bangxuan of Cili, Li Binghuan, Du Zipei, Wang Tianshu of Chenzhou, Qu Heqing, Xiang Liansheng, Li Guiquan of Changsha, Liu Guoshan, Chen Yingzhen of Longyang, Zhou Qi of Xiangtan, and three others whose names are unknown all perished in the disaster. The year before, in the Jihai year, Fu Cixiang, Li Ke, Zheng Baocheng, Cai Chengyu, Wu Luzhen, Shen Xiangyun, and others formed the Zhilizhi Society in Tokyo, Japan. Tang Caichang, Lin Gui, and others established the Zhengqi Society in Shanghai, which was later reorganized into the Self-Reliance Society. In June of that year, a meeting was held at the Wei Chun Yuan Garden in Shanghai. Heroes from all directions gathered like a rising storm, with hundreds of people gathering unexpectedly. Thus, the Self-Reliance Army was created, secretly deployed along the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Datong served as the vanguard army, commanded by Qin Lishan and Wu Luzhen; Anqing served as the rearguard army, commanded by Tian Bangxuan; Changde served as the left army, commanded by Chen Youlong; Xindi served as the right army, commanded by Shen Lu; and Hankou served as the central army, commanded by Fu Cixiang and Lin Gui. The general headquarters, the personal guard, and the vanguard army were stationed in Hankou, with Tang Caichang actually in charge. Fu Cixiang also contacted dozens of former classmates from the Hubei Wubei School who held military power, such as Niu Yongjian, Sun Wu, Ai Zhongqi, to plan for support. The meeting coincided with the Boxer Rebellion, and the Allied forces of various countries captured Beijing, shaking the Qing court. The martyrs believed there was an opportunity and planned to launch a major uprising on the fifteenth day of the seventh month of the Gengzi year, awaiting payment from overseas, but it did not arrive in time. Qin Lishan and Wu Luzhen launched an uprising in Datong but failed. More than ten days later, Tang Caichang and twenty others were martyred. The uprising in Xindi also failed. In the Hubei and Hunan prisons, more than a hundred people died for the cause. Those who participated in this campaign and survived later all established themselves as outstanding figures. Eleven years later, the revolutionary army launched the Wuchang Uprising in the Xinhai year. With the waving of the righteous flag, the whole country responded, and the Qing dynasty was destroyed. Since the Jiawu year, loyal and righteous people, worried about the impending demise of China, did not hesitate to sacrifice their heads to save the country, rising repeatedly after falling. Alas, the establishment of the Republic of China today is all due to the fact that the martyrs of the past did not avoid the sharp blades, shedding blood and going to their deaths, thereby laying its foundation. After the sons were martyred, their heads were not properly buried, and they were buried in simple coffins on Hongshan Mountain, lingering for years, and their graves were not sealed, causing grief within the country. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, the National Government, in pity of their past merits, granted funds for burial and established a memorial hall next to the tomb to be passed down forever. All my comrades, tracing the past, tearfully lament. The successor of Martyr Tang, Youren, entrusted me with the inscription, so I express the intensity of their death and engrave it on the stele, and attach a memorial inscription, saying: When the Ming dynasty collapsed and China was sinking, European winds came from the West, and disturbances and invasions occurred. Loyal and righteous people within the country generously saved the country. Sun Yat-sen rose up, and heaven and earth changed color. The heroes of Hunan and Hubei were like wind, tigers, clouds, and dragons, loyal, brave, and inspiring, and people from all directions followed. The situation in the world required the seizure of Wuchang. The righteous flag was first raised, alas, the national tragedy. The blue blood floated on the river, and the wind and sound planted it. The bright and upright Republic, the golden soup, will be forever solid. If there were no deceased, who would come first? The loyal soul is eternal, view this Chongqian." Written by Wang Zhaoming and calligraphed by Zhang Nanxian.</p>
<p>Memorial Inscription for the Gengzi Martyrs Cemetery: "How upright are these gentlemen, the righteousness in them is concentrated. At the time of the rebellion, Youyan was in a common plight. The disaster of partition was imminent, and the loyal and righteous people were worried. The army became self-reliant, saving the country and revitalizing China. The uprising was planned in Jianghan, in response to Guangdong. They sacrificed themselves to achieve benevolence, repaying the country with their loyalty. This battle was the vanguard of the Xinhai Revolution, and the establishment of the Republic was the first accomplishment. In memory of the previous martyrs, we engrave the stele on the mountain, to pass down their names in the history books, and for all generations to follow." Respectfully written by Lin Sen, erected by the National Government of the Republic of China in October of the twenty-fifth year [of the Republic]. President Jiang's memorial oration said: "In the third month of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, Jiang Zhongzheng, the President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, respectfully sends Huang Shaohong, the Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, to offer sacrifices to the spirit of Mr. Tang Caichang, who launched the uprising in the Gengzi year, and all the martyrs who died at the same time. The tombs are planted with Qilin trees, and the people worship the tablets of loyalty and integrity. The continent is called Yingwu [Parrot], and the tombs of the martyrs are known for thousands of years. It is far from being an embellishment in the historical records, and it is closer to being an inspection of the local customs. The heroic spirits have not faded, and their achievements are equally obvious. Only Mr. Tang Caichang, the former martyr, stirred up unrest in Hunan, and his footprints disappeared on the shores of Hubei. He borrowed his books from Linghu, and waited for the uprising at the border of Chu. He called for support from the center, and the voices of the Yangtze River flowed silently. He was determined to eliminate the old ways, and the heroes from all over the world gathered together. He tried to launch a major uprising to jointly support the restoration of China. He belonged to the strictly forbidden network, and he still fanned the flames of the Southern Mountain prison. The destruction of the nests was fierce and cruel, and he also suffered the tragedy of the Northern Sea. It was the Gengzi year of the twenty-sixth year of the Guangxu reign. At the same time, several people were arrested in Hubei. Although their surnames and names were written on official documents, who engraved their deeds on the tablets? In the midst of overgrown weeds and desolate smoke, there are clusters of tombs and simple burials. Now, the Hubei Public Cemetery Committee raises up all the martyrs who died for the same cause, adds tomb trees, and permanently prohibits firewood cutting. Seeing the completion of the new tomb, we are delighted with the permanence of the good city. Alas, like the high tombs of Qilian in previous generations, they do not need to be painted, and they are better than the lonely and desolate states nearby, which can be approached by officials. Here, we offer fragrant offerings, and may the spirits come to enjoy them. Let us still sing..."</p>
<h3>The Planned Large-Scale Soil Smuggling Operation by the Anhui Construction Department in Shanggan Township, Minhou, Was Cracked</h3>
<p>The organization chartered ships to transport soil exclusively, totaling no less than three million yuan in more than ten trips.</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Deng Wenyu, Deputy Director of the Fujian Provincial Tobacco Prohibition Supervisory Office, came to Xiamen on the 8th and returned to the province on the 12th. According to Deng's remarks in Xiamen, "Tobacco prohibition in this province is being actively carried out, and it must be completed by the deadline of the 29th year of the Republic [1940]. The registration and stamping of locally produced opium have not been clearly understood by the public, and many are not reporting it. Many of these private merchants in the urban areas of Fujian and Xiamen are using foreign brands as protection to smuggle local soil (i.e., the soil stored by the people when opium was grown in Fujian Province in the past) and secretly sell it after smuggling it in from overseas. Our office has recently cracked a large-scale soil smuggling organization. The organization was located in Shanggan Township, Minhou County, and had a cellar. The opium merchant was Lin Bingsen, who specialized in smuggling red soil and chartered ships himself to transport it from Hong Kong, Macau, and other places to Fujian, with each shipment costing 5,000 yuan. It has been transported more than ten times. According to reports, on March 5, our office, together with dozens of members of the 4th Regiment of the Provincial Garrison, went down to the countryside at night to surround it and conduct a strict search. As a result, a large amount of red soil opium paste was found in the organization's cellar, as well as important documents and account books related to the Hong Kong soil merchants. The value of the red soil transported back and forth was no less than three million yuan. However, Lin Bingsen is on the run, and only his brother and five accomplices have been captured and sent to the 4th Regiment headquarters for interrogation. An order has also been issued to arrest Lin Bingsen. It has been found that Shanggan Township is the hometown of Chairman Lin [Sen]. Lin Bingsen is ignorant and foolish, and dares to engage in soil trafficking. Our office has decided to submit a request to the higher authorities to severely punish him in accordance with the tobacco prohibition regulations. Currently, the tobacco prohibition policy in this province has been put on the right track. The Japanese-owned opium dens in the provincial capital, which were negotiated by the provincial government for elimination, were limited to eighty, and this has been implemented this month. The opium dens in Xiamen are also being negotiated by the municipal government and the Japanese consul for elimination. (March 12)</p>
<h3>The Anhui Construction Department Plans to Exploit the Antimony Mines in Xiuning and Jixi</h3>
<p>The quality of the ore meets the needs of modern times. The Military Council awarded the discoverer a bonus.</p>
<p>Tunxi Correspondence: The counties under Huizhou are full of mountains, and the mineral resources are naturally abundant. Among them, there are two antimony mines, one in Jixi and one in Xiuning. The Xiuning mine area is located in Li Guangshan, west of the county, and has rich reserves. Several years ago, the Construction Department of this province sent personnel to investigate and determined that there was an urgent need for exploitation. Last winter, the Construction Department sent technicians Shen Guozhen and Shao Yizhou, the Dean of Wuhan Institute of Technology, to Guangxi for surveying. At the same time, investigator Zhao Tianzong, who was investigating mineral resources from Guangdong, came to Huizhou via a detour and also went to investigate the area. According to Zhao, the quality of the ore meets the needs of modern times. After the cold winter is over, personnel will be sent to conduct small-scale exploitation first, and then gradually expand. The discoverer of the mine is Wang Jintang, a mineral exploration investigator of the Tianfa Mining Company. Now, the association has awarded Wang a bonus for discovering the mine and contributing to the country to encourage him. In addition, the original antimony mine in Jixi has an annual output of about several hundred tons. According to Technician Shen's investigation of the newly discovered Jingzhou mine in the Sanqu area last month, the results are quite good, especially the zinc mine seedlings, which were found to be excellent. The Construction Department's mining plan for this year has decided to prepare for the exploitation of these two mines and plans to proceed in the shortest possible time. (March 9)</p>
<h3>Merchants and People in Guangdong and Hunan Request Improvement of the Cooperative Measures for Selling Guangdong Salt in Hunan</h3>
<p>The people of southern Hunan bitterly complain about six major malpractices. Guangdong salt merchants also request the abolition of the measures.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the cooperative measures for selling Guangdong salt in Hunan were signed and implemented by the authorities of Hunan and Guangdong, the people of various counties in southern Hunan have opposed them due to the excessive tax rates, and Guangdong salt merchants have also requested the improvement or abolition of the contract due to the increase in salt taxes and the difficulty in promoting sales. It has been found that the people of seventeen counties in southern Hunan sent a telegram this month, appealing for the abolition of the cooperative measures for selling Guangdong salt in Hunan, and bitterly complaining about six malpractices: ㊀ The current unified tax is levied at 1.3 yuan per market stone [dan] in eleven counties, including Guidong, and 4 yuan per market stone in seven counties, including Leiyang, Changning, Lingling, Qiyang, Dong'an, Anren, and Chaling. Compared with other specialized sales areas, the tax has been increased by more than six times, which is an excessive and tyrannical levy that the people cannot bear. ㊁ All Guangdong salt entering Hunan is subject to a unified tax of 1.3 yuan per stone in Guangdong, which means that the salt merchants' cost increases by 700 to 800 yuan per stone. The salt merchants sell the goods at cost, and the consumers implicitly bear the interest rate of 700 to 800 yuan. ㊂ The cooperative measures designated Leichang and Changning counties as special zones, which were revised again, and designated Ling, Qi, Dong'an, Anren, and Chaling as special zones, arbitrarily changing them without end. ㊃ Article 1 of the cooperative measures stipulates that 11 jin of salt per capita will be taxed in stages in the exclusive sales area by 7 jiao and 2 fen, which is even more difficult for the people to bear. ㊄ Guangdong salt transported to the exclusive sales area in southern Hunan must be stored in the general warehouse in Chen County. This approach obstructs and makes things difficult. ㊅ The tax tickets issued by the Chen County Inspection Office stipulate a time limit for the sale of salt, which is intolerably harsh. The above points have trapped merchants and harmed the people. We earnestly request that everyone work together to abolish the cooperative measures in order to relieve the suffering. The salt merchants of Guangdong Province also sent a telegram to the central government requesting the abolition to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. The telegram said, "Last month, Ambassador Tang Jian was ordered to go to Hengyang to discuss revising the cooperative measures for selling Guangdong salt in Hunan with the Director of the Hunan Bank Inspection Office. The business associations and others have telegraphed on a micro-day [day of slight solar cold] to request the transfer of orders to the Liangguang Salt Transport Envoy and the Hunan Bank Inspection Office to consult the opinions of Guangdong and Hunan merchants and people and adopt them as much as possible in order to improve the measures. Later, salt merchant representatives were elected to accompany Ambassador Tang. The representatives arrived in Hengyang and gathered representatives of the people from seventeen counties in southern Hunan, as well as Hengyang, Chen County, Lechang, Lian County, and salt merchant representatives to petition for participation in the improvement meeting. Unexpectedly, the Hunan Tax and Transportation Bureau rejected them all. The current cooperative measures have been ordered to be promulgated and implemented. After reviewing the contents of the articles, everything is unfavorable to Guangdong salt. It not only violates commercial sentiment but also violates the principle of taxation. The business associations and others believe that it is difficult to implement and should be approved to order the Liangguang Salt Transport Envoy and the Hunan Bank Inspection Office to cancel the original measures and convene representatives of Guangdong salt merchants and people to properly formulate improvement measures to maintain the salt affairs and benefit the people's livelihood. We are eagerly awaiting orders." The offices of the Liangguang Salt Transport Merchants, the Guangzhou Lower River Salt Industry Guild, the Leiqiong Transport Merchants Business Improvement Association, and the Guangdong Upper River Salt Merchants Guild kowtow together.

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Salt Smugglers' Appeal Pronounced</p>
<p>More than ten salt smugglers, including Huang Zhongzhen, committed numerous robberies in the Haimen area. After being arrested by the Haimen County Government, they were sentenced to imprisonment. The defendants were dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court, which has now concluded the trial and pronounced the judgment yesterday. Huang Zhongzhen and Huang Qilang were each sentenced to eight years of imprisonment. Huang Zhanqi, Ye Youcai, and Shi Fengzhang were each sentenced to seven years and five months. Wu Gen was sentenced to seven years. Cao Wenxian was sentenced to six years and two months. Yuan Zhidong, Yuan Zhiliang, Yuan Yazhen, and Chen Hairong were each sentenced to six years. Zhang Weiqi's part was not accepted.</p>
<p>Initiating the Construction of a Waterworks</p>
<p>Cheng Ganxiang, Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, and others initiated the construction of a waterworks last year, but it was delayed until today due to difficulties in raising funds. County Magistrate Deng Xianghai also believes that waterworks should be vigorously promoted and advocated official-merchant cooperation. It is assumed that the capital is 1.5 million yuan, with the government holding two-thirds of the shares and the merchants holding one-third, with an annual guaranteed interest of 6%. This method is more convenient for carrying out the project. It has been decided by the provincial government when Mr. Zhang Yunbo of the county went to the province the day before yesterday, and a meeting of initiators will be convened on a fixed date to prepare for the project. It is heard that the Shanxi Construction Bank will be responsible for the government shares, and the merchant shares will be publicly raised. Regarding the water source issue, it is roughly in Huangtiandang outside Fengmen. The water quality is currently being tested by Soochow University, and a foreign firm in Shanghai is responsible for planning.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Song Maoxiang Hat Shop Goes Bankrupt</p>
<p>Song Maoxiang Hat Shop, located inside the North City Gate of this county, was opened by Mr. Jiang Zishan, a native of the county. It is an old shop with more than sixty years of history. It prospered ten years ago, but in recent years, due to adhering to old methods and not making improvements, its business has declined sharply. Over time, it has suffered huge hidden losses. Zishan died of illness last year, leaving behind debts of more than ten thousand yuan. The store was then inherited and managed by his son Jiang Ruilin. At the end of the year, when the accounts were totaled, there was another loss of more than three thousand yuan. Unable to maintain it, the store declared bankruptcy yesterday and entrusted lawyer Sun Jianfeng to represent the liquidation.</p>
<p>Sales and Smoking Establishments Close One after Another</p>
<p>The county government recently received an order from the province that all sales and smoking establishments with fewer than fifteen opium smokers should be ordered to close. After receiving the order, the county government found that there were six or seven sales and smoking establishments in the county, of which the first district had the most opium smokers, accounting for one-quarter of the total (sixteen establishments). It was learned yesterday that the following establishments have been ordered to close in accordance with the provincial order: Huisun, Huilong, and Huixin in the second district; Yu Shengdaxing in the fourth district; Rongxing and Cheng Chunji in the fifth district; Anle, Minxing Fuji, and Xiji in the sixth district; Hexing in the seventh district; Tongji, Xinji, and Tongyi in the ninth district; Hexing, and etc, a total of sixteen in the tenth district. All the remaining few opium smokers will be warned in advance to quit.</p>
<p>Strict Enforcement of Old Tax Collection</p>
<p>The county has a total of more than one million yuan in arrears in old taxes. The province stipulated that 50% (more than 500,000 yuan) should be collected first in three installments. As a result, only 40,000 to 50,000 yuan was collected, which was only one-tenth of the collection budget. Fang Guoding, the director of the land tax, immediately arrested all the heads of the districts [tu zheng] who were not effective in collecting taxes and押追 [a form of forcing them to pay]. In this week, more than 100 people have been arrested. On the afternoon of the 13th, a part of the district heads (about forty people) paid off the arrears and handed over the large and small debtors who were difficult to collect from, so they were released on bail. The county sent personnel directly to collect from the debtors, and those who refused to pay were sent to the province for interrogation. Wu Weidun, a large household in Dacheng Lane in the city, was arrested by the county for owing too much tax.</p>
<h3>Huaiyin</h3>
<p>The Huaiyin Sluice Gate Completed Annual Repairs</p>
<p>Since the Huaiyin ship lock built by the Grand Canal Commission opened to traffic on July 1, 1936, an average of about 4,000 ships have passed through each month. Since the beginning of this year, the collection of usage fees has been taken over by personnel sent by the Ministry of Finance, and the traffic situation has not changed much. In order to maintain the various ship lock projects, the commission has a system of annual repairs to check the usage status. This year's work began on February 12 and was roughly divided into two parts: building a dam to cut off the flow and inspecting the sluice gate. (A) A river-blocking grass dam was built at the river mouth upstream of the diversion channel, and sluice gate boards were placed outside the sluice gate channel upstream of the sluice gate, plus filled with soil. (B) After the water accumulated in the sluice gate was drained, it was found that there was no damage to the upstream and downstream switch well gates, the gate bottom, and the steel sheet piles on the left and right banks. Minor repairs were made to the parts that had cracks and leaks, silted mud and sand, and were not in close contact. All the silted earth and stone upstream of the diversion channel were also cleared by hired workers. The entire project was completed on the 8th, and normal traffic resumed on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Resisting the Increase in Business Tax</p>
<p>The Jiaxing Third District Business Tax Bureau received an order from the Finance Department that this year's business tax must be increased by 20% compared to last year. The Bureau notified all investigators to be responsible for collecting and squeezing [taxes] during the initial investigation of the business tax this year. The local County Chamber of Commerce was deeply afraid that the investigators would not ask whether the actual business of the shops had increased or not, and would use the Finance Department's proportional amount as an excuse to order a uniform increase in taxes. All commercial groups panicked and sent a telegram to the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, asking them to advocate and argue reasonably, and to make a tactful statement to the financial authorities, requesting the revocation of the decision to increase the proportional amount in order to show fairness and alleviate the suffering of the merchants in Suzhou.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Turnover of Business Tax Bureau Director</p>
<p>Sun Baoyun, director of Nantong Business Tax Bureau, was ordered by the Finance Department to transfer with Wang Rugan, director of Ruxing Bureau. The transfer will be on the 16th. Xu Weiyu, a member of the commission, will take over the turnover.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang</h3>
<p>A Robbery Occurred in the Suburbs</p>
<p>Zhu Weichuan, who lives in the south end of Baoding Bridge outside the South Gate, opened the Yuhe Oil and Wine Shop. Zhu Yunshang, across the street, opened the Yuheng Grocery Store. Due to their location in a strategic location, their business is very prosperous. Unexpectedly, at about 10 o'clock last night, more than ten bandits suddenly broke through the screen door, most of them wearing militia uniforms. They first grabbed Yunshang and forced him to hand over silver dollars by pouring cold water into his nose. As a result, they robbed more than ninety yuan, as well as clothing, jewelry, cigarettes, and soap. Then they went to Weichuan's house and robbed him of more than sixty yuan. After an hour, the bandits howled and left to the south.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Establishing a Model Tea Farm in Pingshui</p>
<p>Shou Zu, from the Ministry of Industry, came from the China Tea Company, and was specially sent to Zhejiang to consult with the provincial authorities. The Zhejiang Province has agreed to contribute 200,000 yuan in shares, which will be raised by the Finance Department. The company will hold an establishment meeting in Shanghai this month. It is planned to set up a model tea farm in Pingshui, the green tea producing area of Zhejiang Province. In order to make progress and profit, it was decided to expand the original tea industry improvement farm jointly operated by the ministry and the province, purchase additional machinery, and improve the manufacturing of new tea.</p>
<p>Bandits in Tianlai were Captured</p>
<p>Wang Baike and others, bandits from Xianju, hid in Hengdian, which is under the jurisdiction of Jinhua County. After learning this from the Xianju County Government, a secret telegram was sent to Jinhua County to detain the bandit Wang Jinke and seven others. Personnel were dispatched to welcome and bring them back to the case for interrogation. Also, Sanyi Township, Huangdu, in Tiantai County, which is more than twenty miles away from the city, is one of the towns. More than ten bandits suddenly came the night before and broke into Ge Hengyuan's general merchandise store, looting silver and goods for about two hundred yuan before escaping.</p>

Also, Jiang Jianren, the vice president of the school, also passed through Ningbo to the water source on the same day, to oversee the staff and students to admire the scenery of Chairman Chiang's hometown.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Continued Supervision of Old Tax Collection</p>
<p>The county government achieved quite good results in collecting land tax last year. Starting from , the upper period land tax for the 24th and 27th years has reached more than 70%. Together with the old tax, more than 500,000 yuan has been collected. Now that the third period of old tax has reached the deadline for supervision and collection, the provincial department has repeatedly ordered supervision and collection, and has also sent a commission to investigate the amount of collection in previous years and the actual number of debts owed by the people, so as to instruct the collectors to be responsible for the supervision and collection.</p>

<h3>The Bank of Communications Held Its 30th Anniversary Ceremony Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Minister of Finance Kong and Vice Ministers of Transportation and Finance Attended to Provide Guidance</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications held a ceremony yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to celebrate its 30th anniversary. The ceremony was held on the seventh floor of the New Asia Hotel, which was newly decorated. The four walls were hung with congratulatory messages from all sides. On the rostrum were placed treasures and silver vases donated by the Central Bank, etc. Many people from all walks of life in this city went to congratulate them, including Yang Hu, Zhou Jue, Zhou Zuomin, Chen Xing, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Xinliu, Yu Zuoting, etc. The meeting started on time, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Hu Bijang, the General Manager, Tang Shoumin, and more than 300 employees of the bank attended. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Vice Ministers Xu Kan, Zou Lin, and Vice Minister of Transportation Peng Xuepei were specially invited to attend and provide guidance. Chairman Hu led the ceremony and delivered an opening speech, followed by a speech from Minister Kong. The ceremony ended at about 11:00 AM, followed by a photo session and a luncheon. In the afternoon, Kunqu Opera was performed. The speeches are recorded below.</p>
<p>Chairman Hu Bijang said in his opening speech, "Today is the 30th anniversary of the establishment of our bank in society. We are very honored that Minister of Finance Kong and Vice Minister of Transportation Peng have taken time out of their busy schedules to attend and provide guidance. Our bank was founded in the 34th year of Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty and was established by the Ministry of Posts and Communications. The head office was originally located in the old capital. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, it was moved to Tianjin for the convenience of business. In the 16th year, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and the head office was moved to Shanghai in the 17th year. In the process of the past 22 years, our bank was designated by the government to manage the funds for the four administrations of road, electricity, mail, and shipping. Later, because of its agency of the national treasury, its relationship with the Ministry of Finance was closer than that with the Ministry of Transportation. Among the banking colleagues, it was known as 'Zhongjiao' along with the Central Bank. During this period, the successive general managers encountered many difficulties, and their response and support must have consumed a lot of effort. In the past eight years, the National Government has entrusted us with the mission of developing the national industry and has twice increased the government shares with the Ministry of Finance. In the first four years, the business policy of our bank was finalized. Therefore, for the past four years, we have always followed the instructions of Minister Kong and urged our colleagues to strive for progress. The issuance of banknotes by our bank was designated by the government in the winter of the 24th year, along with the Central Bank and the Bank of China, as legal tender. Therefore, the names of the three banks have become more well-known both domestically and internationally, and various businesses have also made significant progress. I have been working in the bank for 16 years, and in the past four years, I have been appointed by the Ministry to work with Mr. Tang Shoumin. Today, I am very happy to meet this grand meeting. There are nearly 2,000 employees in the entire bank, and there are many talents among them. I hope that they will work hard to improve their skills and work together to serve the society and develop the industry. We will see that the progress of the country is endless, and the development of our bank is also endless."</p>
<p>Vice President Kong said in his 30th Anniversary Speech at the Bank of Communications, "Today is the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Bank of Communications. I am deeply gratified to be able to participate in this grand event and see so many talented people gathered together. The significance of holding a commemorative ceremony is nothing more than two points: one is to review the past, and the other is to plan for the future. I firmly believe that the Bank of Communications will hold this 30th anniversary ceremony with these two points of spirit. Now, I will briefly elaborate on the mission that the Bank of Communications has undertaken in the past and the work that it should strive to do in the future. I sincerely hope that all the staff of the Bank of Communications will work together to achieve great results, which will not only be the glory of the Bank of Communications, but also the welfare of the economic future of our country. The Bank of Communications was established in the 33rd year of Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty with investment from the Ministry of Posts and Communications. It was originally intended to assist in the development of transportation undertakings. All matters related to the storage, remittance, and lending of funds for roads, electricity, mail, and shipping were stipulated to be managed by the Bank of Communications. However, due to the loss of the Qing government's outline, transportation undertakings were difficult to take care of. After the establishment of the Republic of China, internal wars frequently occurred, and transportation affairs were not well organized. Therefore, the business of the Bank of Communications gradually turned to the commercial aspect due to environmental reasons, in order to achieve the purpose of self-preservation. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, the government, in order to develop industry, promote economic construction, and adjust the financial system, specially allowed the Bank of Communications to be a bank for developing the national industry and promulgated the Regulations of the Bank of Communications, clearly stipulating that the Bank of Communications shall be responsible for all financial adjustment matters related to the development of domestic industry. Since then, the business of the Bank of Communications has been specialized, and its mission has become heavier. Since the economic depression in the world has affected our country, many of the old enterprises in the country have collapsed, and the new industries have also been shaken. In addition, the sharp rise in the price of silver has led to the outflow of silver, and the market has suddenly tightened credit. The government believes that in order to maintain domestic industry, it is necessary to consolidate finance first, and to consolidate finance, it is necessary to increase the capital of banks so that their financial resources are abundant and can cope with it. Therefore, the Bank of Communications, together with the Central Bank of China, increased government shares in the upper period of the 24th year, so that under the guidance of the government, they could fulfill the task of maintaining finance together. At this time, the Bank of Communications was able to deeply appreciate the government's intention and, based on its original mission, actively carried out the work, including lending to industry and commerce, assisting Shanghai's money houses, and stabilizing foreign exchange prices. Its performance was quite good. This is a fact that is particularly commendable. Until November of the 24th year, the government examined the international economic trends and reviewed the national financial situation, and after careful consideration, it believed that the implementation of the new currency system was not enough to curb the outflow of silver, relieve the financial difficulties, and promote the development of industry and promote economic prosperity. Therefore, the government promulgated the legal tender policy, designating the banknotes issued by the Central China Communications Bank as legal tender, which are universally accepted in the country, and cannot be used as cash. The three banks are also required to buy and sell foreign exchange indefinitely. Since the government promulgated this order, due to the concerted efforts of all sectors of the country and the active implementation of the Central China and Communications Banks, all economic conditions in the country have gradually improved, which is generally recognized. However, since then, in addition to undertaking the mission of developing industry, the Bank of Communications has also been entrusted with the task of assisting the government in implementing the legal tender policy. Its mission has increased, and its responsibilities have become heavier. Since the mission of the Bank of Communications is as important as mentioned above, it is only natural that it should follow the evolution of its history, seek the development of its business, and promote the prosperity of domestic industry. With the size of our country, the number of people, and the richness of our resources, the industry is still in its infancy, and the future is immeasurable. Therefore, the work that the Bank of Communications should strive for is also endless. Now, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of its establishment, the ancients said that a man becomes a family and establishes a career at the age of 30. The Bank of Communications is just at the time of life when it is "thirty and stands," which is the day when it is full of energy and striving for success. How should it be based on its important mission in the past, be united from top to bottom, exert its full strength, follow the government's policy of promoting economic construction, follow the government's guidance, and effectively assist the development of domestic industry, so that the national economy can prosper and the Bank of Communications can occupy a glorious page in the economic history of our country, so as not to live up to the significance of holding the commemorative ceremony today. If it is believed that the Bank of Communications has a long history of 30 years, and it is the longest-standing bank in the country, and it has a sense of self-preservation and clings to the old ways, then it is far from the significance of holding the commemorative ceremony today. I believe that none of the staff of the Bank of Communications has such a shallow view. What I feel even more is that the financial institutions in our country are very short-lived banks organized in accordance with modern methods. Compared with the banks in England, France, and Germany, which have a history of hundreds of years, the situation of advanced and backward is very different. Since the Republic of China, there have been internal wars and external troubles, and recently the impact of economic depression. The financial industry is in a precarious situation, and it is difficult to develop due to the imbalance of camp guards. Until today, the country has achieved unity, and the financial situation has become stable. The government is considering a comprehensive improvement of the entire financial system. I hope that the Bank of Communications will actively carry out the work under the leadership of the government, so that after 40 years, 50 years, or even hundreds of thousands of years, its business will be updated with the times, and its achievements in assisting the development of domestic industry will also increase with the years, so as to live up to the government's heavy responsibility and to comfort the people's expectations. After holding the commemorative ceremony today, I have even greater expectations."</p>

<h3>Meiloran's Report on Smuggling in North China</h3>
<p>Smuggling Suppression in North China is Mostly a Palliative Measure; The Thorough Solution Lies in Restoring Sovereignty Over Northern Hebei</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report from this port, the Inspector General of the Chinese Maritime Customs, Meiloran, recently reported to the central government, saying that organized smuggling in North China is still very rampant, hindering customs duties and reducing the funds available to pay off foreign debt. Inspector General Mei mentioned recent incidents in Qingdao and Tianjin that harmed Chinese sovereignty and customs powers, saying that armed Koreans attacked customs in Tianjin and forcibly took away some of the smuggled goods confiscated by customs. At the same time, a customs officer in Qingdao was beaten by Japanese rioters while performing his duties. Although negotiations have been held on the above two matters, no solution has yet been found. The general attitude of Japan in North China towards smuggling is actually a violation of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of 1896 and the Sino-Japanese Tariff Autonomy Agreement of 1930, which stipulates that all matters concerning import and export tariffs within the territory of China and Japan are entirely regulated by the laws of the two countries. The customs' anti-smuggling organization on the North China Railway is still preventing the flow of tax-evading smuggled goods from Tianjin, but this work is mostly a palliative measure, and the thorough solution to the smuggling problem lies in restoring China's sovereignty in northern Hebei, so that the customs anti-smuggling authorities can normally perform their duties in this area, which is not garrisoned by troops but is controlled by foreigners.</p>

<h3>Redgertu Disaster Situation</h3>
<p>Red Cross Team Leader Zhang Zehao's Investigation Report</p>
<p>When the Suidong War broke out, the World Red Cross Society formed two major teams to set off for the war zone to engage in relief efforts. After two months, Zhang Zehao, the team leader of the Society's relief team, led the team members from Pingdiquan to the Redgertu disaster area by car to investigate. The investigation report is recorded below: Starting from Pingdiquan, the mountains along the way are undulating, and there are almost no people for more than a hundred miles. After passing through 12 Sumu and 4 Flags, it took about 4 hours to reach Redgertu. This place is located in the northeast of Suiyuan and is an important town in Taolin County, bordering Shangdu and He counties. After the war, most of the houses were destroyed by artillery fire. Fortunately, those that survived cannot avoid wind and rain. Many people were killed and injured by bombing. The loss of farming cattle, horses, and vehicles was very heavy. The resident Liu Liuzi's family of four was hiding in a cellar when the plane came, but they were bombed and buried in the cellar. Because the soil in the house was frozen, it has not been dug out to this day. It is also said to be tragic. The climate in Saiwai is always cold in spring, around 23-4 degrees below freezing. The general victims have suffered this catastrophe. There is a shortage of both houses and fuel, and spring farming seeds are especially difficult. The survivors after the looting are all thin and haggard, and the displaced people are everywhere. If they are not relieved quickly, they will inevitably die in the ditches.</p>
<h3>All Commercial Firm Current Deposits Should Be Subject to Income Tax</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance's Reply Forbids Exemption</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly received requests from the Qingdao Bankers Association and the Shanghai Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, among others, requesting exemption from income tax on interest earned by commercial firms on current deposits in banks. These requests have been deemed difficult to approve. The original text is as follows: Mayor Shen Xun of Qingdao Municipal Government, I have received your telegram. Regarding the request to exempt commercial firms from income tax on interest earned on current deposits in banks, the Qingdao Bankers Association, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, forwarded by the Executive Yuan, have made successive requests. The reasons cited, when synthesized, are: ㊀ Current deposits in banks by commercial firms are purely working capital, intended for business operations, and the interest earned is minimal. Their nature is different from ordinary deposits, and earning interest is not the primary purpose. ㊁ Many commercial firms have deposits in one bank but substantial loans or mortgages in other banks or other cities. If only the income tax on deposit interest is deducted, how will the consumption of loan interest be compensated? ㊂ Please follow the example of the banking industry and include the interest earned on commercial firms' deposits under operating income for calculation purposes, without levying income tax on deposit interest. ㊃ Commercial firms' income is already subject to business income tax. If deposit interest is also subject to income tax, it constitutes double taxation. Upon investigation, the reasons presented by the aforementioned groups are not in accordance with the law and facts. The following is an explanation: 1. The term "deposit interest" in Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations is a general provision. Except for the tax-exempt scope stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 3, all other deposit interest, regardless of its nature, is subject to taxation. Therefore, the income from current deposits by commercial firms cannot be an exception. 2. The provisions of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations regarding the scope of taxation adopt a classification taxation method. The taxation procedures for the third category of income tax on interest adopt a source-based method, where taxes are withheld separately at the source of the tax. This differs from the nature of comprehensive taxation. Therefore, even if incomes belong to the same category, their profits and losses cannot be offset if their tax sources are different. 3. Banking is the main business of receiving deposits and extending loans, and the income from deposits and loans is the income from loans. Therefore, it should be included in the calculation and taxation of its principal business income. The interest on deposits and loans of commercial firms other than banking firms is not principal business income. They cannot request tax exemption by referring to the example of bank lending. 4. In all countries, it is customary to allow the deduction of income tax already levied on business income. Item 13 of the draft guidelines for the collection of the first category of business income tax also clearly stipulates that income tax already paid on operating income should be deducted from the income tax payable. Therefore, although income tax on commercial firms' deposit interest has been levied, it can still be deducted from the income tax payable, and there is no issue of double taxation. For the above reasons, the request from the aforementioned groups to exempt commercial firms from income tax on interest earned on current deposits in banks is not in accordance with the law and facts, and cannot be approved. I have received your telegram, and I am replying accordingly. I hope you will investigate and inform accordingly. Respectfully, Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance.</p>
<h3>Returning Chinese Laborers Who Served in France Will No Longer Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Upon Receiving Tickets, They Will Return to Their Home Towns</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, thirty-three Chinese laborers, including Ding Huanzhang, who served in France during the war, have been seeking relief from various parties since returning to Shanghai. The representatives originally planned to take an introductory letter from Lin Yannan, Director of General Affairs of the Municipal Government, to the police station yesterday to petition Division Chief Hong Qi and Director Yin Guanzhi to issue tickets for their return home. However, due to it being Sunday, they changed their plans to go this morning. At the same time, they will also petition the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for relief. All the laborers had intended to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Confucian Committee, and the Central People's Movement Committee in Beijing. However, due to financial constraints, they have stopped and changed to submitting written petitions. All the laborers will leave Shanghai and return to their home towns in three or four days as soon as they receive their tickets.</p>

<h3>Tea Company's Preparations Completed, Shou Yicheng Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Capital of Two Million Yuan Fully Subscribed, Locations for Model Tea Farms in Various Provinces Have Been Surveyed</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the China Tea Company, initiated by the Ministry of Industry, has, in addition to sending telegrams to various tea-producing provinces to solicit opinions and capital subscriptions, also sent Shou Jingwei, Deputy Manager of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, to depart from Beijing on the 11th of last month to contact Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces, and to investigate the tea production situation. After more than a month, he has completed his work and returned to Shanghai. Yesterday, he took the night express train to Beijing to report the progress to the Ministry of Industry and to request instructions on everything. It is reported that Mr. Shou's contacts have been quite satisfactory. All provinces have enthusiastically subscribed to shares. The total capital of two million yuan has been fully subscribed. The method of subscription is based on the principle of equal official and commercial shares. The total amount of two million yuan is divided into 20,000 shares, each share worth 100 yuan. In addition to the 6,000 shares recognized by the Ministry of Industry, totaling 600,000 yuan, Anhui Province subscribed 4,000 shares, totaling 400,000 yuan. Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces each subscribed 2,000 shares, totaling 1 million yuan. Among the 1.4 million yuan of capital in the five provinces, half of the shares will be recruited from commercial shares by tea merchants and local banks investing in shares. Half of the money will be paid first, and the remaining half will be notified to be paid after the company is established and needs money. As for the business policy of the tea company, it focuses on improving production and manufacturing, establishing marketing cooperatives in the production areas, and promoting marketing or acting as agents for marketing.

<h3>Fluctuating Labor Strife in Silk Factories</h3>
<p>Jin Sheng Resumes Work, Solution Is Expected; Jing Yun and Three Other Factories Launch Strikes; Mei Ya's Two Factories Were on Strike Yesterday</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, workers in silk factories such as Jin Sheng, Tian Cheng, and Xin Hua in western Shanghai went on a joint strike the day before yesterday to demand improved treatment. After the Silk Fiber Workers' Union in the third district sent personnel to negotiate separately, Jin Sheng Silk Factory has achieved a very satisfactory result, and Xin Hua and other factories are also gradually approaching a solution. Workers in three silk factories including Jing Yun in the eastern district of Shanghai have also launched strikes. The two Mei Ya factories, the second and tenth, continued to strike yesterday. It is reported that workers in various silk factories have put forward various demands, and the labor strife has a tendency to spread throughout the city. The details are compiled and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jin Sheng Silk Factory Resumes Work Satisfactorily</p>
<p>After all the workers of Jin Sheng Silk Factory on Bailinan Road in western Shanghai went on strike the day before yesterday to demand improved treatment, the general manager and factory director went to the union to visit the person in charge of the union to discuss.

<p>Ping Ping Silk Factory Reaches Agreement</p>
<p>Ping Ping Silk Factory in Caojiadu declared bankruptcy last year, but the procedures were not clear. Therefore, all the workers in the factory entered the factory the day before yesterday, demanding to start work, but without any results, they stayed in the factory for meals and lodging, and prepared a document in their joint names, requesting the union to find a way to provide relief and to negotiate with the factory on their behalf. After the union forwarded the request to the Party and government authorities for mediation and sent personnel to negotiate with the factory several times, the factory agreed yesterday to give funds to disband the factory, and the workers also agreed. The workers' representatives then summoned both labor and management parties and reached a dissolution agreement last night.</p>
<p>Xin Hua Silk Factory Is Approaching a Solution</p>
<p>All the workers of Xinhua Silk Factory in Gongyi Lane, Caojiadu, put forward more than ten demands to the factory the night before yesterday, but were not accepted. After all the workers went on strike, the union sent personnel to mediate. The factory's attitude has improved and the opinions of both parties are gradually approaching a solution. The turmoil is expected to be resolved.</p>
<p>Yu Cun Silk Factory to Mediate This Afternoon</p>
<p>All the workers of Yu Cun Silk Factory on Bailinan Road went on strike because the factory was not opened after stopping work last year. The Social Affairs Bureau and the General Labor Union separately summoned both parties for mediation. However, due to the factory's repeated delays, there was still no result, causing panic among all the workers. They prepared a document and went to Party and government agencies and the General Labor Union to petition. After an indirect consultation between labor and management yesterday, there has been some progress. It is heard that the City Party Department will convene both parties this afternoon for a strong mediation.</p>
<p>Tian Cheng Silk Factory Is Expected to Be Resolved</p>
<p>All the workers of Tian Cheng Silk Factory in Caojiazhai in southwestern Shanghai demanded improved treatment and requested negotiations with the factory, but without results. After joining the Jin Sheng and other factories in the strike the day before yesterday, Jin Sheng and other factories have achieved good results through the union's mediation yesterday. It is heard that Tian Cheng Factory may also follow the solution of Jin Sheng Factory, and most of the conditions have been negotiated, with only a few issues unresolved.</p>
<p>Workers in Various Factories Put Forward Demands</p>
<p>Since the workers in various silk factories such as Jin Sheng, Tian Cheng, and Xin Hua rose up to demand improved treatment, more than a hundred silk factories in western Shanghai such as Yongfeng, Yiyou, Yunlin, Baohua, Fuxing, Hongchang, Hexing, Mei Ya's four factories, Da Mei, etc., in eastern Shanghai such as Yu Hou, Tian Yi, Zhengfeng, Yong'an, Yu Sheng, etc., in southern Shanghai such as Mei Ya's ninth factory, general factory, Yongfeng, Huacheng, Yuanyuan, etc., and in Zhabei Mei Ya's tenth factory, Juchang, Xingmin, etc. have all gathered to discuss and have unanimous demands.</p>
<p>Silk Weaving Union Strives to Mediate</p>
<p>There are many silk factories in western Shanghai, and all the workers are also relatively organized. Recently, the silk workers in Shanghai have risen up to make demands, and their activities are increasing day by day. Therefore, western Shanghai has also been slightly affected. Fortunately, the union's leadership is strong, which has prevented a massive labor strife from occurring. However, dozens of silk factory workers have submitted their demands to the union according to the peaceful method instructed by the union, requesting that the demands be transferred to the various factories for uniform implementation. It is heard that the union has collected and summarized the demands of the workers of various factories and set a standard demand, and immediately scheduled a meeting with the factories tonight for earnest discussions to seek a solution and quell the disputes.</p>
<p>Three Factories in Eastern Shanghai Also Went on Strike</p>
<p>Following the resolution of the disputes in Mei Feng and other three factories in the eastern district of Shanghai, the workers of Jingyun Silk Factory in Sanyi Lane, Huasheng Road, Huixia Silk Factory in Huaiying Lane, Taopeng Road, and Zhengjue Silk Factory in Huasheng Road also put forward improvement demands to the factory. As there were no results, they implemented strikes from the afternoon of the day before yesterday and petitioned the government agencies for assistance. In addition, the strike turmoil in Jin Sheng Silk Factory on Linqing Road has been resolved through mediation by the Municipal Party Department, and it is scheduled to resume work uniformly this morning.</p>
<p>Two Mei Ya Factories Persist in Striking</p>
<p>After all the workers of Mei Ya's Tenth Silk Factory at Baziqiao in Zhabei and Mei Ya's Second Factory on Jiaotong Road went on strike successively because they failed to improve their treatment, the Municipal Party and government agencies immediately sent personnel to the two factories to investigate the truth about the labor strife, and at the same time advised the workers to resume work first and wait for the conditions proposed to be resolved according to law. However, the workers insisted that they would not resume work until the conditions proposed were resolved. Therefore, all the workers continued to strike yesterday. According to the factory, the silk weaving machine in the factory is contracted by the foreman, who pays according to the factory's fixed price, and the right to hire workers is controlled by the foreman, which is not directly related to the factory. Therefore, the factory is not convenient to advise on the dispute.</p>
<p>Xin Yu Yarn Factory Party and Government Mediation</p>
<p>After all the workers of the Second Factory of Huashang Xin Yu Textile Company at No. 8 Roberts Road in western Shanghai went on strike the day before yesterday in protest against the factory dismantling the machines and reorganizing the factory affairs, all the workers resumed work on the same day after the Party and government agencies sent personnel to jointly advise with the Cotton Spinning Industry Union of the Third District. Three measures were temporarily decided, and it was decided that the Municipal Party Department would convene both labor and management parties at 2:00 PM tomorrow to conduct mediation to seek a thorough resolution of the disputes.</p>
<h3>Instrument and Stationery Industry Association's Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Suggestions Regarding Income Tax</p>
<p>The Instrument and Stationery Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce regarding the calculation of income tax rates for employees' late arrival and early departure deduction: Dear Sir, I have just received your association's notice stating, "On the 9th of this month, we received the Ministry of Finance's Income Tax Affairs Office's letter No. 520 stating (the original text has been seen in previous reports)." After checking, if any factories or stores have the above-mentioned situation, they can follow this procedure uniformly. I am sending this letter to notify you, and I hope that you will check and distribute it to your affiliated businesses to follow as a basis for handling. Article 11 of the Implementing Rules, "For income calculated on a monthly basis, if it is less than one month, the tax will be calculated based on the actual amount of income," is extremely clear. Article 10 of the Draft Collection Guidelines for the Second Category of Salary and Remuneration Income Tax stipulates that if the income from salaries and remuneration is calculated on a monthly basis and is less than one month, the tax should be calculated based on the actual amount of income at the original rate. For example, if Mr. A's monthly salary is fixed at 400 yuan, and he leaves his job after half a month, with an actual payment of 200 yuan, the tax should be calculated at the rate of the original 400 yuan, and the tax is 4 yuan and 8 jiao. This is clearly inconsistent with the provisions of Article 11 of the Implementing Rules. Now, the method stipulated in the Income Tax Affairs Office's letter No. 520 is based on Article 12 of the Draft Collection Guidelines for the Second Category. According to the Collection Guidelines, all procedures for interpreting collection should be based on the regulations and detailed rules, and the methods already stipulated in the Amendment Rules and Detailed Rules cannot be changed. Although the salaries of employees in various factories are fixed monthly, those who ask for leave will have their salaries deducted on a daily basis, and those who work overtime will also have their salaries increased on a daily basis. The actual monthly income is different from the fixed amount. Therefore, it is called monthly, but it is actually daily. According to the provisions of Article 11 of the Detailed Rules, if the monthly income is less than one month, the tax should be calculated based on the actual amount of income. If the monthly income exceeds one month, the tax should also be calculated based on the actual amount of income. For example, if a person's fixed monthly salary is 60 yuan, and his actual salary in January is 50 yuan, the tax is 1 jiao and 5 fen. If his actual salary in February is 75 yuan, the tax is 4 jiao. Regardless of the fixed amount, the actual monthly income is calculated according to the table, which is very simple. The state treasury and the taxpayer will not be harmed. If, according to the provisions of Article 12 of the Draft Collection Guidelines, the income calculated on a monthly basis is less than one month, the tax is still calculated at the rate of the original payment, then the tax rate for salary and remuneration income is based on the fixed amount, not the actual amount. In fact, the actual amount of income is less than one month and more than one month should be treated equally. For example, if a person's fixed monthly salary is 60 yuan, and his actual salary in January is 50 yuan, he must pay a tax of 1 jiao and 7 fen. If his actual salary in February is 75 yuan, he only needs to pay a tax of 2 jiao and 5 fen. Such calculations are extremely troublesome and will inevitably cause many misunderstandings in the future, which will not benefit tax revenue. I respectfully ask you to check and forward this to the Ministry of Finance to delete Article 11 of the Draft Collection Guidelines for the Second Category in order to avoid disputes and benefit the promotion of income tax. Furthermore, Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the Income Tax Implementation Regulations stipulates that for the second category of income, whether it is calculated on a monthly basis or on an annual basis, the tax should be calculated on a monthly average. The income calculated on an annual basis should be calculated on a monthly average, which is especially appropriate. According to the provisions of Article 26, Paragraph 2 of the Implementing Rules, the second category of income should be paid monthly. Although the salaries of employees in various factories are fixed monthly, those who ask for leave must be deducted on a daily basis, and those who work overtime on night shifts and Sundays will be paid on a daily basis. Therefore, in reality, the monthly income of employees is generally not fixed. For example, a person whose fixed monthly salary is 40 yuan has an actual income of less than 40 yuan or more than 40 yuan. The employer deducts the tax amount according to the actual monthly income. Now, according to the regulations, the tax is calculated on a monthly average, then the amount of tax deducted monthly is not accurate. It is necessary to recalculate the annual income on a monthly average at the end of the year. For the previous eleven months, the tax amount that was overpaid must be applied for a refund, and the tax amount that was underpaid must be paid again. In this way, the withholding employer will have more procedures and is prone to errors. The deducted employee will not easily understand and misunderstandings will arise. Even the collecting agency will inevitably increase many procedures and expenses. In fact, it is of no benefit to tax revenue. I believe that income tax should strive to avoid complicated procedures at the beginning of its establishment, in order to be simple and easy to implement. I propose that the second category of income, which is calculated on a monthly basis, be changed to calculating the tax based on the actual monthly income, which seems simple and without drawbacks. I ask your association to forward this to the Ministry of Finance and modify it when the regulations are amended. It is really convenient and beneficial. Sincerely, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3>Fudan Student Yang Zhijing Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Swallows a Large Amount of Medicine, Rescue Efforts Fail — Four Suicide Notes Unreleased —</p>
<p>Yang Zhijing, a 21-year-old third-year student in the Accounting Department of Fudan University, was from Suzhou, residing at 9 Tiaofeng Lane, Wuxian County. He graduated from Suzhou Yan Cheng Middle School and entered Fudan in the autumn of the 23rd year. He was unmarried, his father had passed away early, and only his elderly mother, in her sixties, remained at home. He had two elder brothers, both currently working in the capital, and an elder sister who was married. Yang's paternal uncle, Yang Yizhi, is currently working in the Ministry of Railways in the capital and is very fond of Yang Zhijing, so all his tuition and other expenses were borne by him. Yang studied diligently at school and achieved excellent results. However, he was by nature silent and rarely smiled. Every Saturday, he would go to his paternal cousin's house, who was employed at the Minfeng Cotton Mill, and return to school on Sunday, as was his custom. The day before yesterday, after class on Saturday, Yang did not go home. He went out once around 6 p.m. and only returned at 10 p.m. He chatted with his classmates briefly and then went to bed. Unexpectedly, at 1 a.m., Yang suddenly got up and secretly swallowed sixteen ounces of medicine, committing suicide. His roommates were unaware at the time. When they heard moaning, they lit a candle to check on him and discovered him. He was already unable to speak. A medicine bottle was left on his desk, along with a packet of Taikoo sugar. Sugar crumbs were scattered all over the desk, and there were remnants of medicine in a glass. A copper key was also found. His roommates immediately reported to the school's health office, which in turn summoned an ambulance and sent him to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. However, due to severe poisoning, he died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The school authorities immediately notified his cousin and his family in Suzhou, who arrived one after another yesterday morning to handle all the funeral arrangements. Four suicide notes were found among his belongings in the dormitory, which are currently being kept by his cousin and have not been released. There was also a package of letters, tied with hemp rope, with instructions to be opened by his sister. As for the reasons for his suicide, it is generally speculated that it may have been due to financial difficulties.</p>

<h3>Jade Art Preview Extended for Five Days</h3>
<p>Entries to Be Judged Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Jade Art Preview Exhibition for the Paris International Exposition, which opened on the 6th, has been attracting a large number of visitors every day. Especially last Sunday and yesterday, being holidays, there was an endless stream of people from morning to night. Now that the ten-day exhibition period is over, today is the last day, and there will be even more visitors. To prepare for the transportation of the entries to France, it was originally decided not to extend the exhibition. However, due to many requests from people in distant places to continue the exhibition for a few days, and because of the crowds in recent days, people in Shanghai were also afraid of not being able to visit. After repeated discussions last night, it was decided to extend the exhibition for another five days, from the 16th to the 20th. The displayed items will be re-selected, and many more fine pieces will be added for rearrangement. The opening hours have also been changed to 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Admission tickets are still sold for one yuan. However, group tickets, originally intended for schools and organizations, will no longer be sold during the extended exhibition period to maintain order in the venue, as many groups have already visited in the past ten days. Previously issued complimentary tickets will also be invalid. It is also learned that all entries for the competition have been gathered in the sorting office of the Sino-French Industrial School, and a review meeting will be held on the 16th for detailed selection. Notifications have already been issued, and the Ministries of Education and Industry, as well as the Executive Yuan, will each send a representative to Shanghai to participate in the review.</p>

He said that he would base his efforts on the enthusiasm of everyone and the actual situation of domestic workers, and strive to reduce the suffering of workers, to live up to the expectations of the government, everyone present, and tens of millions of fellow workers. In addition, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, hosted a banquet for Zhu at the Central Western Restaurant on the Fourth Road last night, and invited Wu Kaixian, Tong Hangbai, and others to accompany him. The Shanghai Labor Movement Alumni Association also hosted a farewell banquet at its clubhouse in Meijialong yesterday, with more than 20 members attending. Chairman Ye Gui and recorder Wang Mingde first reported that the association was grateful for Mr. Zhu's enthusiastic support. Although Mr. Zhu's trip abroad would be short, they were reluctant to part with him. Before Mr. Zhu's departure, they hoped that he would give them instructions and parting words. Then, Mr. Zhu gave instructions, indicating the direction of the association's work and how the students should strive for the labor movement in the future. His guidance was very detailed and moving. The attendees dispersed in farewell at 5 p.m.</p>
<h3>Doctor Sues Inspector for Obstructing Freedom</h3>
<p>Case Dismissed as a Result</p>
<p>Shen Heqing, a 44-year-old Chinese medicine practitioner from Pinghu residing at 2 Changren Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, sued Police Inspector Yang and Chief Inspector Jin of the local police station in the Local Court for obstructing freedom and scaring a child to death. Yesterday, Judge Liu Pajun presided over the hearing. Shen Heqing testified that he did not know the defendants. On the night of February 26, they knocked on the door and came in, saying they were looking for an "Ah San." When I opened the door, they said they would break in, so I had to open the door. They rushed in with six or seven people and pointed a gun at me. They rushed upstairs, and my child, who was breaking out in measles, was so frightened that he cried loudly. He died two days later. They didn't find anything when they searched, so I asked them why they came to search. They said that someone had reported that I was gambling at home. I asked him who reported it, and Chief Inspector Jin said that he had reported it and would fight a lawsuit with him. Therefore, I asked the law to judge. The judge said that the defendants were not summoned this time to first ask the reason for your actions. According to your testimony, the facts are very clear. They were exercising their duties by searching for gambling, not intentionally abusing their power. It is not good to fight a lawsuit, so it is better to withdraw the case to avoid further litigation. Shen followed the court's advice and withdrew the case.</p>
<h3>China International Famine Relief Commission Discusses Emergency Relief for Henan</h3>

All resolutions were recorded below: ⑴ Approved the minutes of the previous meeting. ⑵ Elected Zhu Youyu and Tian Boli to attend the Changzhou meeting. ⑶ Mr. Baker proposed that Henan Province suffered a severe drought last year, and after sending people to investigate, the disaster was found to be extremely severe. It was proposed to suspend the 15th anniversary fundraising and prepare for emergency relief for Henan, and to first borrow some of the 20,304.39 yuan raised from the anniversary donations and quickly distribute it to the disaster area.

<h3>National Postal Workers' Union Held Memorial Service for Zhao Shusheng Yesterday</h3>
<p>About 700 People Attended</p>
<p>The National Postal Workers' Union, to commemorate the late standing committee member Zhao Shusheng, jointly held a memorial service with the Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou Postal Workers' Unions at 6/F, Pootung Native Association, Aidoa Road, at 2 p.m. yesterday. The chairman of the National Postal Workers' Union, Lu Jingshi, presided over the service. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue</p>
<p>Before the hall, there was a plain-colored memorial arch. In the center of the hall hung the portrait of the Premier and the national flag. Below was a portrait of Mr. Zhao. Wreaths surrounded the front of the stage, and mourning couplets filled the area. At the entrance where guests signed their names, there were memorial badges of Mr. Shusheng and a special issue of "Chinese Postal Worker" commemorating Mr. Zhao, which were given to the guests.</p>
<p>Attending Guests</p>
<p>In addition to the executive and supervisory committee members of the National Postal Workers' Union and the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, and representatives from the Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Suzhou Postal Workers' Unions, Wang Xiaolai, Tao Baichuan, Wu Kaixian, Huang Renzhi, Jiang Huaisu, Ma Gongyu, Zhao Banfu, Cheng Haifeng, Tong Hangbai, Zhou Xuexiang, and representatives from various labor unions, totaling more than 700 people, attended the memorial service.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Lu Jingshi reported on Mr. Zhao's life and deeds, stating that today, the National Postal Workers' Union is holding a memorial service for Comrade Zhao, and is deeply grateful for the presence of all the gentlemen and comrades from afar. I will briefly describe the life and deeds of Comrade Shusheng to everyone present. Comrade Zhao was from Yueqing County, Zhejiang Province, and had few siblings. His parents were healthy, but they were old. Comrade Zhao was intelligent and quick-witted. He studied diligently with his father in his youth and was keen on learning. In the 12th year of the Republic of China, he entered the Shanghai Postal Administration as a postal worker. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, he participated in the postal workers' movement. Previously, Comrade often had articles published in the "Shanghai Postal Worker" published by the Shanghai Labor Union, and his colleagues admired his beautiful writing style and often sought his advice. Thus, Comrade became a brave general in the postal workers' movement, contributing greatly to the postal protection movement, the recovery of postal rights movement, and the merger of the Savings and Remittance Bureau. The establishment of the National Postal Workers' Union was first planned and prepared by Comrade. After the union was established, Comrade was elected as a standing committee member and secretary-general, making great contributions to promoting union affairs. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, Comrade was elected as an executive committee member and secretary-general of the Shanghai General Labor Union, making many contributions to the labor movement. In addition to dedicating himself to the postal and labor movements, Comrade was also enthusiastic about education, serving as the secretary-general of the Minli Middle School and the director of academic affairs of the Chinese Postal Worker Correspondence School, serving diligently and tirelessly. In his spare time, he also worked for the colleagues of the Party, so he was truly a comrade who could not be separated from the colleagues for a day. Speaking of his personal qualities, he had high morals, did not seek fame or profit, worked diligently, and was dedicated, and was especially responsible, and was always admired by his colleagues. Recently, he overworked himself while presiding over the commemorative conference of Minli Middle School, accumulating overwork and illness, and eventually could not recover. I feel that the death of Comrade Shusheng is a great loss for both public and private affairs. The dead are gone, and we are here today to commemorate Comrade, and we should emulate his spirit of hard work to complete his unfinished ambition. Then today's memorial service is not without meaning. Then Tao Baichuan, Ma Gongyu, Huang Renzhi, Cheng Haifeng, and Zhu Xuefan gave speeches in succession.</p>
<p>Family's Response</p>
<p>Finally, the family representative Ding Shuhan gave a response, saying, I am deeply grateful for the presence of everyone today, and I am grateful for the generous words. Now I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the family. The meeting adjourned at 6 p.m.</p>
<h3>Municipal Zoo's Black Panther Transported to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, Director Shen of the Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road ordered a black panther from a local animal dealer last winter. It has now been transported to Shanghai. The animal is all black and looks like a tiger but is slightly smaller, so it is called a "black tiger" in its place of origin. Its eyes are bright, and it bares its teeth and claws when it sees people, looking extremely ferocious. The animal originally comes from the Malay Peninsula, and the partial cost was 550 yuan in national currency. However, the animal likes warmth, so the zoo has specially installed iron bars at the end of the pool room, where the kangaroo cage used to be. The installation of the iron fence will take half a month, so the official display period will still be after half a month.</p>
<h3>New Pharmaceutical Industry Sets Order Conforming to the New System of Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>The Association Notifies Members</p>
<p>The New Pharmaceutical Industry Association of this city notified its members yesterday, stating that, With the aim of observing the new system of weights and measures, Standing Committee Member Zhu Ruichen proposed at the seventh executive committee meeting held on the 11th of this month that members should be notified to use centimeters and cubic centimeters when ordering goods from foreign countries in the future. It was resolved to notify members that from June 1 of this year, all members should use the centimeter and cubic centimeter system when ordering goods from foreign countries. Assuming that the original one tael is now changed to 25 centimeters or 25 cubic centimeters, and the original one pound is temporarily changed to 450 centimeters or 450 cubic centimeters. You are hereby notified to take note of this.</p>
<h3>Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A (15)</h3>
<p>Q: Mr. Jiang Xixian from Guangzhou asks: ⑴ If a express letter or registered letter is lost, how much is the compensation according to the postal regulations? ⑵ If a letter sent from this province (Guangdong) to another province has half of the envelope sealed, and the postage stamp is only two cents, can it be delivered? ⑶ How much postage is required to send your newspaper (referring to the Guangzhou Yuehua News) to Jiangsu every day after reading it? Can it be delivered if only half a cent stamp is affixed? ⑷ There is a letter now that I want to send to Jiangsu. For the sake of caution, it has been registered for delivery. If I want it to be delivered quickly, can I pay an extra fee to the post office for expedited delivery?</p>
<p>A: ⑴ Express letters are the same as other mail, divided into "domestic" and "international" types. Domestic express letters are divided into "ordinary express" and "express registered". Ordinary express mail, in addition to being delivered quickly, is subject to the regulations of ordinary mail. Express registered mail is subject to the regulations of registered mail. Express letters sent to foreign countries, except for those sent to Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the Kwantung Leased Territory, are also divided into ordinary express and express registered. All others are ordinary express and there is no express registered category. The processing procedures are the same as for international ordinary mail. This journal has briefly mentioned it in the first and second issues. Express letters mentioned in your letter presumably refer to express registered letters. If express registered mail or registered mail sent to various places in the country is lost, if the reason is due to the special nature of the item, or the original defects, or due to natural disasters, or other force majeure matters, or due to the item violating the postal regulations, or being contraband, the post office will not compensate. In addition, the sender may, within six months from the date of delivery of the item (within twelve months if the place of sending or receiving is in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Xikang, Tibet, or Mongolia), apply to the original post office for compensation. The bureau will determine the amount of compensation based on the original price of the item, but the maximum amount per item shall not exceed 10 yuan in national currency. The same applies to those sent to Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the Kwantung Leased Territory. As for registered mail sent to other countries, unless it is due to the above restrictions, or because the destination country does not bear the responsibility of compensation according to its own laws, no compensation will be made. The compensation amount per item shall not exceed 50 gold francs.</p>
<p>If the sender voluntarily waives the right to compensation and requests that a letter identical to the original letter be re-mailed, the re-mailed letter may be exempt from postage.</p>
<p>(2) Letters sent to each other in various places, whether sealed or not, should be affixed with postage stamps of five cents for every 20 centimeters or its odd number. If your letter is only affixed with postage stamps of two cents, it must be processed as underpaid postage when it arrives at the destination, that is, the recipient will be charged twice the amount of the shortage (six cents).</p>
<p>(3) The amount of postage depends on the weight. The rate for ordinary newspapers sent to each other in various places is half a cent for every 50 centimeters of weight.</p>
<p>(4) Has your letter already been mailed? If it has already been mailed, then you can no longer pay an extra fee to the post office for expedited delivery, because the post office does not have a method to re-collect postage and change the delivery method of a certain type of mail after it has been sent. If it has not been mailed, then there is no need to register it. Just send it as an express registered letter, because the express registered method combines safety and speed.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, Today's news in your newspaper about the sale of aphrodisiacs involves Aihua Gujing Pills.

It has a long history of more than 20 years, and it has been qualified by the Central Health Test Institute and awarded a first-class certificate by the Ministry of Industry. It proves that the prescription is pure and suitable for medicinal use, and there are no bad ingredients mixed in it, which is enough to prove it. However, the police did not recognize how to misunderstand and searched rashly, which is a pity. We are now handling it in accordance with the law and waiting for a solution. The sections in your newspaper are not in line with the facts and I am afraid that they will confuse the audience. I am specially writing to inform you, and I hope that it will be published in the letter column for correction.

<h3>Modern Politics and China</h3>
<p>— Junshan</p>
<p>Dear Comrades:</p>
<p>In the current environment of serious national crisis and international turmoil, we must have a clear understanding of the trends of modern politics and the destination of Chinese politics. We will discuss this issue in four paragraphs:</p>
<p>1. Explanation of the meaning of politics;</p>
<p>2. The truth of modern politics;</p>
<p>3. Changes in modern politics;</p>
<p>4. Conclusion.</p>
<p>1. Explanation of the meaning of politics.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Politics is the matter of the public, and governance is management. Managing the affairs of the public is politics." This has become a conclusion today and does not need to be discussed further; however, we must also agree and supplement to enable you to have a deeper understanding of the meaning of politics.</p>
<p>"Managing the affairs of the public is politics." We can see three special features from this sentence. What are those three features?</p>
<p>First, politics is the management of the affairs of the public, not the public managing themselves - the right to govern - organization;</p>
<p>Second, politics is the management of the affairs of the public, not the management of the public - the law of governance - canons;</p>
<p>Third, politics is the management of the affairs of the public, not the non-management of the affairs of the public and the abuse of the affairs of the public - governing people - leaders.</p>
<p>These three features are what we must understand today when studying the Three Principles of the People's political science, because this is a definition, and it is a concept that we must have. Why do we say that these three features are the features of the Three Principles of the People's political science? We can answer them one by one.</p>
<p>The first feature is "politics is the management of the affairs of the public, not the public managing themselves," which explains the right to govern. As you all know, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People separate the right to govern from the right to govern. The right to govern is in the people, and the right to govern is in the government. The Three Principles of the People have such a spirit, which has long been contained in the definition of politics, that is, "politics is the management of the affairs of the public, not the public managing themselves." This is the right to govern, and its expression is organization.</p>
<p>The second feature is "politics is the management of the affairs of the public, not the management of the public." What kind of spirit is this? That is, there must be a law of governance. We must know that the fundamental basis of politics lies in having canons and rules. It is absolutely not something that can be done casually one way at one time and another way at another time. Therefore, when it comes to politics, we must create various canons as a basis. And these canons are also the law of governance. This sentence means that there must be a law of governance - and its expression is canons.</p>
<p>The third feature is "politics is the management of the affairs of the public, not the non-management of the affairs of the public and the abuse of the affairs of the public," which means that politics is inseparable from governing people. As everyone knows, when it comes to politics, there are many people responsible for politics. Some are passively indifferent to politics, while others manage politics from an active perspective. However, those who manage politics must also be managed, which gives rise to leaders.</p>
<p>The above three features, put together, mean that there must be organization, canons, and leaders. In this way, it becomes a party. Because with a program, an organization, and a leader, it is a party. Therefore, the meaning of politics in the Three Principles of the People is the meaning of party rule; the political meaning of Sun Yat-sen is party rule. This is the basic understanding that we must first have when studying politics. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>First Division Football of the Western League, French Business School Beat Saint Francis Yesterday</h3>
<p>Saint Francis and Western Business Have Completed Their Schedule</p>
<p>Yesterday, two matches in the First Division of the Western League were held at the racecourse. As a result, although the French Business School suffered a series of fierce battles, it still defeated Saint Francis by a score of eight to five. However, Saint Francis was also exceptionally sharp, repeatedly threatening the French Business School along the way, but ultimately lost due to inferior strength. At the same time, in another match between Soker and Western Business, Soker took advantage of the remaining power of defeating Laoyier. Before the game, it was predicted that they would have a lot of confidence, but the result was another 4-4 draw, which can be said to coincide with the 2-2 draw in the first round. It is also a strange thing that the two teams have met twice in the season and it is difficult to distinguish between them. Now, both Saint Francis and Western Business have completed their entire schedule. In each of the 18 games, Saint Francis has 6 wins, 2 draws and 10 losses, while Western Business has 3 wins, 3 draws and 12 losses. Saint Francis was last year's Second Division champion, and it is quite proud to have achieved this result as a newly promoted First Division team, especially the game against Laxus with a score of 4-2. There was also a morning league game yesterday, and Jinde again defeated Jewish with a score of 12-0. The results of yesterday's game and the current situation of the First Division are listed separately as follows.</p>
<h3>Responsibility for the Shen Garden Incident</h3>
<p>Donghua Claims to Have Been a Guest Team on That Day</p>
<p>It is Difficult to Bear This Irrelevant Responsibility</p>
<p>The person in charge of Donghua explained the issue of responsibility for the Shen Garden incident yesterday, saying that Donghua's injury this season was due to the use of the city's stadium, and Shen Garden was the designated venue for the Shanghai Western Football Club, so Donghua was in the position of a guest team on that day, and it was absolutely difficult to bear this irrelevant responsibility. Moreover, the initiators of the unfortunate incident at that time were the spectators. The actions of the Donghua players had absolutely no motive to provoke or cause disputes, and they took all possible precautions to protect the referee from leaving the field after the incident occurred, which was an indisputable fact witnessed by the audience that day. As for the remaining time when the incident occurred, although there were only 16 minutes left, it was not impossible for Donghua to turn the defeat into victory in these 16 minutes, even though Donghua was 4-1 behind at the time. Therefore, if the authorities tacitly agree that the British army won and will not replay the game, Donghua will put forward a serious protest or equivalent countermeasures.</p>

<h3>Zhang Boling Arrives in Shanghai, Nankai Alumni Welcome Him at a Banquet</h3>
<p>Zhang Talks About Student Movement in North China</p>
<p>Zhang Boling, the president of Nankai University, came to Shanghai yesterday morning from Beijing after attending the Sports Association and the Chinese Education Society held in Beijing, at the invitation of the Nankai Alumni Association in this city. The Nankai alumni in Shanghai held a welcome meeting at the YMCA in Baxianqiao yesterday noon and discussed matters such as building an alumni association and establishing the Ernan Primary School in Beijing. The reporter from Shenzhou News Agency explored and recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Nankai Alumni Spring Banquet Welcomes Zhang The Shanghai branch of the Nankai Alumni Association held a spring banquet at noon yesterday at the 9th floor of the YMCA in Baxianqiao and welcomed the president of the school, Zhang Boling. More than 80 alumni staying in Shanghai, including Zheng Xigu, Wei Wenhan, Li Zushen, Zha Liangjian, and Wu Xingye, attended. Wei Wenhan, Zheng Xigu, and others gave welcome speeches separately. Zhang also gave a speech during the banquet, offering his condolences to the alumni. They also discussed the method of building the Nankai Alumni Branch in Beijing (the General Association is currently located in Tianjin). As for the motive for establishing the Beijing branch, it was when Chairman Chiang was in distress in the Southwest last winter. Zhang rushed to Beijing from Tianjin and vowed that when Chairman Chiang safely escaped, he would build an alumni association in Beijing to commemorate the event. As expected, Chiang returned to Beijing safely, so Zhang decided to actively prepare for it. It has now been decided that the funding will be 21,000 yuan, with the Nanjing alumni responsible for one-third, other alumni responsible for one-third, and Zhang personally responsible for one-third. Once the funds are available, construction will begin immediately. In addition, Zhang, at the request of various parties in Beijing, decided that because there were too few primary and secondary schools in Beijing, Nankai would establish a primary school in Nanjing, named Ernan Primary School. The atmosphere was very cordial at the banquet yesterday, which dispersed at 1:30 pm.</p>
<p>Zhang Talks Freely About Education in North China When the reporter inquired about the recent situation of education in North China, he said that the students in North China were extremely quiet and buried themselves in their studies because there was no instigation or exploitation by the Communist Party, and the situation was very good. It turns out that in the past, the thinking of young people was easily inclined to the left, which was not entirely due to understanding Marx's economic propositions, but rather due to political stimulation. In addition, the early revolution was not yet thorough, and the dissatisfaction of young people was naturally easily vented. The harvest of Bailing Temple last year actually gave the youth the best understanding and belief. As for the student movement in North China in the past, it was also an expression of public sentiment and should not be condemned too much. However, it was easily relied upon by outsiders, resulting in unexpected incidents. In short, if young people can understand the means of internal pacification and external resistance, they should work hard. The most important thing in the current thinking of young people is to build the country with unity. If the country is strong, foreign forces will not be able to invade. China has lost land almost as much as two countries in Europe. If we do not work hard, we will be sorry for the country. However, the suppression of bandits and the improvement of international relations mean that the revival of our country can be expected in the near future. As for the education problems in North China, the key lies in leading the youth and students to recognize the country and build it together, and so on.</p>

It is proposed to restore the old system and abolish departments and establish bureaus. After receiving the submission, the provincial government considered that the restoration of the Education Bureau is related to changes in the county system and requires careful advance planning and has transferred the submitted cases to the Department of Education for overall planning.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>Japanese Economic Diplomacy and Kodama's Visit to China</h3>
<p>— Sen Yu</p>
<p>Since the formation of the Hayashi Cabinet in Japan, its China policy has indeed shifted slightly, most notably in the emphasis on "economic diplomacy." "Economic diplomacy" – what a beautiful term! It doesn't sound as frightening as Koki Hirota's "scorched earth diplomacy," nor is it as lacking in substance as Hirota Koki's "cooperative diplomacy." It can somewhat be described as a pragmatic and steady strategy. However, can it truly bridge the gap between China and Japan? Will it genuinely lead both countries to a state of "coexistence and co-prosperity"? This is something that deserves our deep consideration.</p>
<p>Due to various internal and external realities, the Japanese authorities have also realized that continuing recklessly in the same way is difficult to imagine for the future of their country. Therefore, they have been forced to partially and temporarily ease their excessively aggressive policies and adopt a more prudent approach, seeking to rationalize their aggression. This rationalization takes the form of activities towards China under the banner of economic cooperation and economic partnership. In Japan's own calculations, this is profitable rather than wasteful like military ventures. Even if military victories bring substantial gains, the massive resources expended are consumed by bullets and gunpowder. If economic partnership can truly be achieved, it can yield both principal and interest. If it develops smoothly, it can still achieve their desired goals. Furthermore, it caters to the tastes of some Chinese who care only about immediate petty gains and disregard long-term major harms. They actually believe that imperialism and colonialism can involve mutually beneficial cooperation, and they believe that the relationship between China and Japan can truly achieve fundamental adjustments through economic cooperation and economic partnership. At the same time, another group of people believes that giving Japan considerable economic benefits can somewhat reduce military entanglement and allow them to survive for the time being. Under these circumstances, the calls for economic partnership have become increasingly loud.</p>
<p>When the Japanese Diet reconvened on February 15th, Hayashi Senjuro, in his capacity as Foreign Minister, made the following speech: "The peoples of both countries should foster amicable feelings, clarify the relationship between the two countries, and work together... Not only the government should do so, but it is also necessary to stimulate interaction between the private sectors to promote the actual achievements of Japan-China partnership and cooperation." This so-called interaction between the private sectors and partnership and cooperation mainly refers to China and Japan engaging in economic partnership. On the 26th, senior officials from the four ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, Navy, and Finance held a meeting to change their China policy. It is said that the meeting resulted in a decision to temporarily abandon the traditional China policy, leaving political issues for future discussion, and focusing all efforts on economic and cultural partnership for the time being. On the 27th, Army Minister Sugiyama, in response to a question from a legislator, said: "Japan's belief is that Japan-China relations must begin with economic partnership, and Japan is currently working to realize economic partnership." Following this, the new Foreign Minister Sato Naotake took the stage, and his replies in the Diet repeatedly emphasized the application of so-called economic diplomacy. In short, the current Japanese strategy towards China, whether it be political parties, financial groups, or even the military, seems to have a unified tendency to focus on economic advancement. It is reported that after the Diet adjourns, a permanent conference body will be formally established on foreign affairs. The past meetings of the three ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy will be expanded to include the Ministry of Finance, forming the Four Ministries Conference of Foreign Affairs, Army, Navy, and Finance, to regularly discuss foreign policy. The intention of including the Ministry of Finance is to "promote economic friendship with China as the main objective."</p>
<p>Moreover, it is not only the Japanese government that is like this. The private financial circles have always had a great interest in economic activities. The relationship between the government and the financial circles is indeed much stronger now than before. In the past, due to the deep divisions between the military and the financial cliques, views on China policy and economic development in China often could not be unified. In the future, the divisions between the two sides may not be completely eliminated, but they are at least much more harmonious than in the past (in fact, the military and the financial cliques are two sides of the same coin). It is very clear that under economic diplomacy, the government and the general financial circles have already been closely integrated and are actively engaged in economic advancement into China. The appointment of Yuki Toyotaro as a cabinet member fully demonstrates the depth of the relationship between the government and financial circles. Currently, Yuki is not only the Minister of Finance in the cabinet but also holds a leading position in the financial, monetary, and economic circles. His importance is conceivable. He has always strongly advocated engaging in economic development in China from the economic aspect, so his appearance is obviously a great driving force for the Hayashi Cabinet's economic diplomacy.</p>
<p>Kodama Kenji and other economic envoys have arrived in China, marking the first sound of Japanese economic diplomacy. According to Kodama's remarks when he left Tokyo for Kobe a few days ago (the 12th), it seems that their visit to China was passive. He said, "The Sino-Japanese Trade Association is holding a meeting in Shanghai this time. The Chinese side sent a letter notifying us and inviting Japanese representatives to attend. Therefore, the Japanese side decided to gladly attend the meeting." However, this is just superficial official talk, deliberately acting as if nothing is happening. Didn't he also say, "We would like to take this opportunity to observe the financial and economic conditions that the Chinese government and the public are working hard to build, and exchange opinions with influential figures in China on various issues as much as possible"? The magic weapon of economic diplomacy is hidden in these lightly sketched words!</p>
<p>Undeniably, Kodama and others are actually envoys formally dispatched by the other side, coming to lead the first charge of economic diplomacy. Their ambitions are very grand. According to our current speculation, they will at least carry out the following main tasks: First, seek the integration of the entire Sino-Japanese economy, using various pleasant phrases to lure China and the general economic circles into the so-called "Japan-'Manchukuo'-China bloc," treating the Chinese economy as an appendage of Japan's quasi-wartime economy. "Industrial Japan, agricultural China" – this conforms to the standard model of economic cooperation between imperialism and colonies. Second, regarding the development of the North China economy, it is not enough to directly negotiate with the North China authorities. During this visit of Kodama and others, when they "exchange opinions with influential figures in China as much as possible," they will inevitably engage in further and more concrete discussions. North China stands on the front line of China's economic partnership, and North China's abundant resources are precisely the number one target that Japan currently considers most beneficial and suitable. It is said that Japan wants to achieve the legalization of seizing economic interests in North China, and it is willing to avoid stimulating Chinese sentiment as much as possible within a possible range. Third, in terms of individual special projects, there are really many. Let's list the most important ones below: ① Demand that China reduce tariffs to facilitate the import of Japanese goods. This has been brewing for quite some time, and it is a key condition of "special trade." Here, we don't need to trace back too much. Just look at the situation of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China held in Shanghai a few days ago to understand how enthusiastic the Japanese side is about the movement to reduce Chinese tariffs. All proposals from Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places attach importance to this point. Their main goal is to monopolize the Chinese market, not only to drive out the goods of European and American countries but also to prevent China's own industry from ever rising. ② Regarding the construction of transportation routes, the main focus is on building railways and opening up aviation, and its scope is not limited to North China but will expand to important areas throughout China. Because North China alone is not enough to satisfy the Japanese side. Seeing the competition of other countries in China's railways and air routes, he really feels a little envious, especially recently, the activity of the British and American opening up of the Far East route, and the British and French in the Sichuan-Yunnan area, the Japanese side obviously holds a very jealous attitude (although Germany is a peer, Japan certainly does not like his activities to a certain extent). Yes, Japan's resources are limited and it cannot fully achieve its ideal development. But it will eventually have to compete with other countries, at least trying to exclude the current entries and exits of Britain, the United States, and France, so as to avoid the relative reduction of its own sphere of influence. Perhaps Kodama and others will raise unofficial concerns with the Chinese side regarding this issue. ③ Regarding the leadership of Chinese finance, Japan has long sought it day and night, but because its strength is insufficient, it has always failed to compete with the strong European and American capital, especially the deeply rooted British hegemony. However, Japan's ambition will never be abandoned, and it is working hard to attack every day. When the House of Peers Budget Committee convened on the tenth of this month, it even involved the British HSBC Bank from discussing economic diplomacy. Foreign Minister Sato also said, "For economic diplomacy, I think it is necessary for our country (Japan) to imitate the British HSBC Bank." Isn't this fully revealing Japan's envy of the financial power of the British HSBC Bank? It has the intention of replacing it; whether it is possible or not is another question. Therefore, this visit of Kodama and others to China, promoting Japan's financial power in China, must also be one of the important projects. Kodama and others' advocacy that the silver stored in the Shanghai Japan Bank should be returned to China has to be considered quite meaningful. They may want to use nine million silver dollars to make an ideal deal. ④ In addition, such as the acquisition of land rights by Japanese industrialists and businessmen in China (it is said that in the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China, the fourth proposal in Qingdao was: "The issue of the acquisition of business residence and other necessary land for industrialists and businessmen"), the reduction of Japanese commodity freight rates on Chinese railways (in the same meeting, the second proposal in Jinan was: "The case of differential freight rates for the transportation of Japanese and Japanese factory products on China's state-owned railways"), as well as expanding and strengthening Japanese business institutions in China, credit guarantee loans, etc., must also be of concern to Kodama and others, and there are too many to list here. ⑤ Furthermore, as Kodama said: "I will take this opportunity to observe the financial and economic conditions that the Chinese government and the public are working hard to build"; investigation and observation are of course one of the main tasks of Kodama and others' trip. They can see the real state of the Chinese economy, and even the situation in various aspects other than the economy. This is directly related to the future trends of Japan's means towards China.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a look at the members of the envoy group again. They are mostly first- and second-rate figures in the Japanese economic circles, which can further recognize the importance of the envoy group. Kodama Kenji, the head of the delegation, served as the manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Shanghai branch, and later rose to become the president of the bank. He is currently the president of the Japan-China Trade Association. He is quite familiar with the situation in China and has a high reputation in Japan. Secondly, the members of the delegation include Oya Noboru, president of Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Kato Keizaburo, president of the Bank of Korea, Miyakegawa Hyakutaro, former chairman of Mitsubishi Corporation, Kajima Joichiro, president of Nisshin Spinning Co., Ltd., Ishida Reisuke, managing director of Mitsui &amp; Co., Fujiyama Aiichiro, president of Dai-Nippon Sugar Co., Ltd., Hori Arata, president of Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, Akiyama Ikuki, councillor of Mitsubishi Goshi Kaisha, and Yutani Kyoichi, managing director of the Japan-China Trade Association (all from Tokyo), Iio Ichiji, chairman of the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China, Shoji Heikichi, president of Toyo Spinning Co., Ltd., chairman of the Japan Textile Federation, and Ohira Kensaku, managing director of Sumitomo Bank (all from Osaka), Nagoya Chamber of Commerce and Industry Vice Chairman, Tanida Risaburo, president of Tanida Spinning Co., Ltd., etc. (all from Nagoya), all of whom have important positions, covering the financial, textile, transportation, sugar, and import and export industries. In particular, there are many representatives of the textile industry, which shows that Japan's advancement in the textile industry in China in the future will definitely be more active than before: It is said that the Japanese textile industry and the Japanese textile industry in China proposed that the Chinese and Japanese textile industries sign a mutual assistance agreement, which is worthy of attention. The Chinese textile industry, which is being squeezed so hard that it cannot breathe, how precarious is its future! Mutual assistance agreement, who believes in genuine mutual assistance! Moreover, now Japanese goods, both legal and special, are coming all over the sky and land, and it is said that all you see may be Japanese goods soon.</p>
<p>Then, under the current state of reality, can the so-called Sino-Japanese economic partnership achieve formal coordination? For this, we don't seem to need to quote a large set of theories. It is enough to use the Japanese side's own words to answer. Yoshida, the chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Shanghai, said in a booklet published in Tokyo: "The policies adopted by Japan often lead to the retrogression of Japan-China relations, such as the attitude towards China's currency reform and the so-called special trade in North China. Japan may think that its attitude is reasonable, but China feels that this attitude is extremely unreasonable and incomprehensible... The oft-repeated economic cooperation is only possible when China is still in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial state, and when China is still a primitive agricultural country... Japan must eliminate the harsh China policy and adopt a policy that is morally acceptable to the Chinese government and practical."</p>
<p>On the eighth of this month, the new Japanese Foreign Minister Sato Naotake said in response to Ogouchi's speech in the House of Peers: "The current Sino-Japanese problem can only be solved if we change our methods and start from a new starting point. Negotiations between completely independent countries should be based on equal status... We often hesitate to adopt an equal position and regard ourselves as superior. This kind of superior concept often causes great obstacles in international relations."</p>
<p>Let's look at the words of Kodama Kenji, the head of the economic envoy group who came to China this time, to the reporter of the Central News Agency on the third of this month: "Regarding the economic partnership, although opinions are divided, generally, it is sincerely felt that the improvement of friendly relations between China and Japan and the harmony of the people of the two countries are prerequisites. Under the situation of opposition, it is extremely difficult to make the partnership proceed smoothly... We sincerely believe that resolutely respecting China's territorial sovereignty in politics and strictly maintaining mutual benefit and equality between the two countries in economy; following this principle to improve the relations between the two countries should not be difficult.” On the day he left Tokyo for Kobe to take a boat, Kodama Wen repeated: "According to my old ideas, the two countries should not stand on the principle of respecting territorial sovereignty, mutual benefit and equality, to improve the national relations between the two countries."</p>
<p>"Respecting territorial sovereignty and responding to equality" is the minimum belief of the Chinese people; but this needs to be done by the Japanese side in a real and practical way, and it must not be just a casual statement, or even a check that will never be cashed. We naturally dare not arbitrarily say that what they said is just superficial articles, but the facts finally cannot but make us have some doubts about these "sincerities," no, we simply cannot trust them! Listen: Minister of Commerce Godo said in the House of Representatives on the ninth of this month: "Manchukuo is an independent country... Manchukuo's industrial plan and funds are all created by Japan alone. If this kind of Manchukuo is threatened by China, it will be a great shame to our country's (Japan) industry." Also, the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on the tenth when replying to a foreign visitor's question: "Equal mutual benefit is a principle recognized by international law, but if it involves specific issues, such as eastern Hebei and northern Chahar, it should be regarded as another event because of the complex situation." Then, on the twelfth, Foreign Minister Sato also gave a speech, claiming that Manchuria has become a firm fait accompli; he will continue to fulfill the three basic principles of the Arida era, which have been transformed from the second principle of Tanida. The puppet Manchukuo can be regarded as a "fait accompli," and eastern Hebei and Chahar can be regarded as "another event"; where is the so-called respect for territorial sovereignty?</p>
<p>Let's look at the facts again: "Japanese military aircraft are still constantly coming and going in Hebei and Chahar," "One day to buy land in Fengtai to open an airport," "The Japanese Concession in Tianjin is preparing to expand," "New Chinese traitor groups are active in North China," "Japanese and Korean ronin traffic drugs," "Personnel of Japanese special agencies conspire to disrupt Chinese politics," "The Puppet Bank of eastern Hebei opens," "A large number of smuggled goods are transported into the country by armed forces," "Ronin resist smuggling," "Ronin rob customs," "The old puppet organization cannot be cancelled, and it is rumored that a new puppet organization will be realized." Isn't all of this posted on newspapers every day? Iron-like facts, no matter how clever his diplomatic rhetoric is, if the above situation exists, heaven, Sino-Japanese relations may never be reconciled!</p>
<p>Solving political problems is a prerequisite for economic partnership. Without the restoration of sovereignty and the recovery of lost land, what equality and mutual benefit can be discussed! Just as Sato said, there are various different routes to achieve the goal, and the so-called economic diplomacy is only one of the routes, and the fundamental policy has not changed at all!</p>
<h3>A Perspective on the Yuki Finance</h3>
<p>— Zhou Langchen</p>
<p>㊀ The Origins of Yuki Finance</p>
<p>Japanese finance, during the time Takahashi Korekiyo was Finance Minister, was commonly referred to as "Takahashi Finance." During the time Baba Eiichi was Finance Minister, it was commonly referred to as "Baba Finance." This time, with Yuki Toyotaro as Finance Minister, it is also customarily referred to as "Yuki Finance."</p>
<p>The content of these three types of finance is clearly different:</p>
<p>Takahashi Finance was known as "sound finance." His financial policies were: no increase in taxes, gradual reduction in public debt, allowing interest rates to take their natural course, and preventing increases in defense spending. Therefore, there was no urgent need to reorganize the tax system. Takahashi Finance was quite pleasing to financial capitalists, but not to the military, so he ultimately became a sacrifice during the February 26 Incident.</p>
<p>Baba Finance followed Takahashi Finance and was exactly the opposite, adhering to "pro-military finance." His financial policies were: increasing taxes and issuing more public debt, thus requiring fundamental reforms to the tax system. Baba Finance, to cater to the demands of the military, proposed a huge budget of 340 million yen, leading to soaring prices, plummeting stocks, no one subscribing to corporate bonds, and large construction projects being shelved due to rising raw material prices. The general public also complained due to difficult living conditions. Thus, Baba Finance was called "unstable finance," inevitably causing the Hirota cabinet to collapse with it.</p>
<p>Yuki Finance ascended to power using the shell of Baba Finance. He inherited the "pro-military finance" of Baba Finance but with some reductions. Even after his reductions, the unprecedentedly large budget remained largely unchanged, but its essence was clearly different.</p>
<p>Below, I intend to focus on Yuki Finance, compare it with Baba Finance, and explain the nature of Yuki Finance.</p>
<p>㊁ The Predecessor of Yuki Finance</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Yuki Finance ascended to power using the shell of Baba Finance, so there is no doubt that it is "pro-military finance." However, to understand Yuki's pro-military finance, we must first explain the essence of Baba Finance's "pro-military finance."</p>
<p>Baba Eiichi was originally the president of the Hypothec Bank of Japan. The Hypothec Bank of Japan is a real estate bank. Its main business is lending and issuing Hypothec Bonds. Lending is divided into mortgage loans, credit loans, specially secured loans, annuity repayment loans within 50 years, and fixed repayment loans within 5 years. Collateral is based on real estate, such as farmland, residential land, houses, factory foundations, and fishing industry foundations, and railway foundations, etc., which can all be used as collateral. Secondly, the issuance of Hypothec Bonds is a method of absorbing loan funds. The issuance limit of this bond was originally ten times the fully paid-up capital. Later, it was further expanded to fifteen times the fully paid-up capital. The funds absorbed by the Hypothec Bonds were lent to rural and fishing villages, which is indeed the function of the Hypothec Bank of Japan. From this, it can also be seen that the foundation of the Hypothec Bank of Japan lies entirely in rural areas, and saving rural areas is saving the Hypothec Bank of Japan. Therefore, the Hirota cabinet, in order to win over rural areas, specially invited Mr. Baba to become Finance Minister. After Mr. Baba became Finance Minister, he catered to the psychology of the military on the one hand, and also let go of favoring rural areas on the other, indirectly favoring the Hypothec Bank of Japan.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Baba's position was like this, the essence of his huge budget was to expand military spending as much as possible on the one hand, and to greatly expand subsidies on the other. The funds subsidized by the national government to local finances even reached over 200 million yen.</p>
<p>In short, Baba's pro-military finance was rural-based. Taxes were levied on industry and commerce, and most of the tax revenue was sent to the Navy and Army, with a small portion used for subsidies to rural areas to do a favor for the rural population. This is the essence of Baba Finance.</p>
<p>㊂ The Background of Yuki Finance</p>
<p>However, Yuki Toyotaro was originally the president of the Industrial Bank of Japan. The Industrial Bank of Japan is a movable property bank. Its main business is underwriting and issuing public bonds, corporate bonds, and stocks. In this way, it provides substantial funds to the state, local governments, and various business companies to help the development of their businesses. The securities underwritten can later be sold to the market at the appropriate time. The difference between the underwriting price and the sale price then becomes the source of profit for the Industrial Bank of Japan. Among them, the Industrial Bank of Japan's business particularly focuses on the underwriting and issuance of stocks and corporate bonds of various business companies. It can be seen that, contrary to the Hypothec Bank of Japan, the foundation of the Industrial Bank of Japan lies in the prosperity of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Therefore, when General Hayashi formed a cabinet, in order to save the industrial and commercial sectors, he had to invite Yuki, the president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, to become Finance Minister. When Mr. Yuki became Finance Minister, although he still maintained a huge budget to win the favor of the military, the essence of his huge budget changed due to the background of the Industrial Bank of Japan.</p>
<p>㊃ The Spirit of Yuki Finance</p>
<p>Now that the emergence of Yuki Finance is as described above, we can point out its fundamental spirit from his amendments (amendments to Baba Finance's budget bill). In short, it can be summarized in two points:</p>
<p>㊀ Pro-Military Finance Although Yuki Finance reduced Baba Finance's huge budget (340 million yen) by 22 million yen to 281 million yen, its fundamental nature as "pro-military finance" did not change. Originally, in the Baba budget proposal, the expenses of the Navy and Army for the Showa 12th year were as follows (unit: 1,000 yen):</p>
<p>Navy: 708,545</p>
<p>Army: 701,073</p>
<p>The total of these two Navy and Army items (1,409,618,000 yen) is 35.1 million yen more than in Showa 11th year, and twice the 72.4 million yen in the 7th year. This time, when Mr. Yuki reduced the budget, he did not reduce a single yen of this huge military expenditure in the amendments. Only 46 million yen was suspended from use. The Navy and Army each accounted for half of this 46 million yen that was suspended from use, and half of the Army's share was postponed to the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the Yuki budget is still fully "pro-military finance."</p>
<p>㊁ Industry and Commerce-Based Finance As mentioned above, Baba Finance was rural-based, so it paid special attention to the interests of large and small landlord classes. In other words, it heavily taxed the industrial and commercial classes to transfer benefits to rural areas. In the Baba plan, on the one hand, there was no land adjustment subsidy (i.e., subsidies), the amount of which was 22 million yen, which should have been paid to the local governments by the national treasury. On the other hand, almost half of this 21 million yen came from increased income tax and capital interest tax. This was taking from industry and commerce and giving to rural areas. Now, Yuki Finance is clearly different. Mr. Yuki values industry and commerce and despises rural areas, so his finance is industry and commerce-based finance. On the one hand, he cancelled 15 million yen of the 22 million yen in local subsidies and increased the existing temporary financial subsidy from 20 million yen to 70 million yen. In this way, rural areas lost at least 10 million yen. In other words, the national government could spend 10 million yen less and reduce taxes by 10 million yen. Coincidentally, this 10 million yen in the Baba budget came from direct and indirect taxes, which the Yuki plan simply and neatly reduced.</p>
<p>The total amount of tax increases in the Baba plan was originally 46 million yen (including increased tariffs). Now, in Mr. Yuki's amendment, the total amount of tax increases is 25.3 million yen. Therefore, Mr. Yuki's amendment has actually reduced the amount of tax increases by 17 million yen. Most of this reduced 17 million yen is taxation on industry and commerce, according to the following rough estimate:</p>
<p>A. Suspend special surcharges on income tax, reduce... 7.8 million yen</p>
<p>B. Reduce other direct taxes... 1.6 million yen</p>
<p>C. Reduce indirect taxes... 3.6 million yen</p>
<p>D. Suspend transaction tax, reduce... 3 million yen</p>
<p>E. Reduce tariffs... over 1.7 million yen</p>
<p>Total... over 17 million yen</p>
<p>Observing the table above, it can be seen that items A and B, which are close to 10 million yen, are both reducing the burden on industry and commerce. In addition, the suspension of transaction tax also benefits industry and commerce.</p>
<p>It can be seen that Yuki Finance is industry and commerce-based finance.</p>
<p>㊄ The Truth About Yuki Finance's Tax Cuts</p>
<p>Furthermore, Baba Finance increased taxes by 46 million yen. Of this tax increase, 12 million yen must be deducted as local subsidies and returned to the people (rural areas). Therefore, the actual tax increase was only 24 million yen. Mr. Yuki's tax increase was 29 million yen, but only 7 million yen needs to be deducted for temporary village and town financial subsidies. Therefore, the actual tax increase is still 22 million yen. A brief table is listed below to clarify this (unit: 1,000 yen):</p>
<p>Therefore, judging solely from national taxes, the Yuki plan reduces taxes much more than the Baba plan (the tax reduction is 460,000,000 - 290,000,000 = 170,000,000 yen). However, when combined with local taxes (referring to subsidies, etc.), Yuki's tax reduction is actually very small. The tax reduction is only 20 million yen. (240,000,000 - 220,000,000 = 20,000,000 yen)</p>
<p>Therefore, although Yuki Finance has achieved the goal of increasing revenue for the national treasury, the imbalance in the burden on the people has been ignored.</p>
<p>㊅ Public Debt Issuance Amount</p>
<p>On the one hand, Yuki Finance reduced taxes by 17 million yen. On the other hand, it also reduced expenditures by 23.8 million yen. However, the total revenue and total expenditure are still insufficient by 772,253,000 yen, so it is necessary to resort to increasing the issuance of public debt.</p>
<p>This 772,253,000 yen was originally the amount of public debt issued for general accounting. If combined with the amount of public debt issued for special accounting, it would be 915,000,000 yen. The public debt issuance amount of the Yuki plan is compared with the public debt issuance amount of the Baba plan below:</p>
<p>From the table above, it can be seen that although the public debt issuance amount of Yuki Finance is more than 10 million yen less than that of Baba Finance, it is still a huge public debt figure.</p>
<p>㊆ The Destination of Yuki Finance</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that Yuki Finance is actually a finance that both increases taxes and increases debt. However, it puts the difficulties of rural areas aside and reduces the burden on industry and commerce considerably. The result of a huge finance is bound to create a situation of "financial oppression of the economy," especially a financial policy that both increases taxes and increases debt, which is particularly capable of creating this situation. However, under the premise of "pro-military finance," increasing taxes and increasing debt are both necessary. The question here is the ratio between the two. That is, what kind of ratio should be maintained between the two to avoid as much friction as possible? This is what should be considered. The goal of Yuki Finance's tax cuts (a large tax cut in terms of national taxes) is probably also here.</p>
<p>However, taxes and public debt both come from the people. Of course, the payment of taxes is compulsory, and the subscription of public debt is voluntary. But if the country wants to raise huge funds through these two paths, the private sector must have sufficient wealth. Otherwise, if the private sector's wealth is exhausted, they will pay taxes but have no remaining ability to subscribe to public debt, or even if they have the remaining ability, they will not be willing to subscribe to public debt. Then, what is called increasing debt is equal to drawing cakes on paper.</p>
<p>The intelligent Mr. Yuki naturally took this point into consideration. Therefore, at the beginning of his tenure, he paid attention to financial control.</p>
<p>Speaking of financial control, the first thing to pay attention to is the central bank. In Japan, this is the Bank of Japan. Originally, the former president of the Bank of Japan, Mr. Fukai Eigo, was a protector of the Bank of Japan's traditionalism. He adopted a conservative and passive attitude towards financial policy. Therefore, he and Takahashi Finance were most harmonious. When it came to Baba Finance, it was no longer appropriate. The failure of Baba Finance without the cooperation of the Bank of Japan was also one of the reasons. Therefore, this time when Mr. Yuki came to power, he ousted Fukai and brought in Mr. Ikeda Narabin. Mr. Ikeda is Mr. Yuki's fellow villager (both from Yamagata Prefecture) and was originally a major partner in the Mitsui zaibatsu and the general leader of Japanese financial capital. He has always held the ambition of "controlling industry with finance." This time, Mr. Yuki invited him to come out of retirement, which will allow this old general to show off his skills and use the country's financial capital (the Bank of Japan) to control industry.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the direction of this control is to have the country's financial capital promote industry and have the entire industry be the rear support for finance. On the negative side, it is probably necessary to continue implementing a low interest rate policy in order to drive private idle funds so that they are not worth investing in other areas and can only be invested in public debt. On the positive side, the Bank of Japan's open market operations (Open Market Operation) should not only be satisfied with selling transactions (transactions of selling public debt), but should also promote buying transactions. In this way, although public debt is increased, there is no need to worry about not being able to digest it. In addition, controlling industry through finance means supporting industry through finance. When industry develops, taxes can naturally be increased. Therefore, Yuki Finance pulling the Bank of Japan together with the Industrial Bank of Japan is indeed a strong point. He uses controlling finance to support his finance, which is indeed a clever plan.</p>
<p>㊇ Problems Left Behind</p>
<p>However, will Yuki Finance be smooth sailing all the way without any problems? That is not the case. Mr. Baba caused prices to soar by proposing a huge budget, which forced him to step down. Mr. Yuki specifically proposed a tax reduction amendment to save the rising prices, thinking it would be a fundamental solution. However, will Japanese prices be willing to fall in this way? We will try to study the main reasons for the soaring prices in Japan, which are roughly no more than the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese industry was originally overproducing, but in recent years, the military industry has developed, and the general purchasing power of society is stronger due to the military boom. Therefore, the inventory of general commodities has gradually been cleared out. Since production is no longer felt to be excessive, prices naturally tend to rise.</p>
<p>(2) Due to the huge budget, the government's purchasing power is strong, and merchants anticipate that prices will be expensive, so they deliberately raise prices, so prices tend to rise higher and higher.</p>
<p>(3) Due to increased tariffs and rising raw material prices, manufactured products must also rise in price accordingly.</p>
<p>Of the above three points, only the third reason has been eliminated by Yuki Finance. The remaining first and second reasons have not been touched at all. Therefore, it is very difficult to suppress prices.</p>
<p>If prices cannot be suppressed, on the one hand, the lives of the masses will be greatly difficult. The only way to solve this is to increase wages, but a general increase in wages will further fuel the soaring prices. On the other hand, if prices rise too high, exchange rate dumping will lose its effect, and foreign exports will naturally shrink, causing international lending to fall into a reverse trend.</p>
<p>Therefore, the price problem is ultimately the most difficult problem for Yuki Finance to solve.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Public Bonds Were Stable Last Week</p>
<p>The public bond market last week remained in a state of hesitation and did not expand. This was because the environment was stable, supply and demand were balanced, and market prices fluctuated between several corners. However, as the delivery period gradually approached, swap transactions became more lively. The 96 public bond was enthusiastically raised due to the acquisition by a certain bank and the rise of speculators. Later, the bulls resold it, and the market returned to normal. The entire week's process is as follows: On Monday, the trend was extremely sluggish, and transactions were also quiet. Market prices fluctuated due to mixed buying and selling by retail investors. On Tuesday, the trading volume on the table became more and more depressed. Sixteen and ten, etc., were mostly bought, and the price rose by one or two corners. On Wednesday, the market turned to a falling trend. Large institutions such as thirty-five, forty-three, and thirty-two, etc., vigorously sold off, and market prices gradually fell by two to six corners. On Thursday, the bulls and bears fiercely competed with each other, but because retail investors' minds were firm, the market rebounded by one to three corners. On Friday, the market atmosphere was still quite stable, and the chips on the table were quite tight. Market prices also continued to rise. The 96 public bond was purchased by eleven, thirty-four, fifty-nine, etc., and the price rose by three to five corners. On Saturday, the bulls and bears held their ground very firmly. Market prices fell from firm to weak again due to the selling by large institutions. The result for the entire week was a slight weakness of one or two corners, while 96 rose by three corners and a half. The total transaction volume was 26,395,000 yuan. The comparison of its rise, fall, high, and low is listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with active conditions. Prices rose from unchanged to up five points due to overnight bull closing and slight short selling. Buyers were wary of rebounds and were cautious. There were not many sellers, short covering, and fellow traders bought nearby months in large quantities. Brokers and foreign firms absorbed distant months. The high consumption in February is also sufficient to help the firm trend of nearby months. Although rain has been obtained in the west, it has not attracted attention. The closing was firm, with spot prices up seven points and futures up six to eight points. British cotton spot prices rose seven points and futures rose two points. After Indian cotton mostly settled, European exporters bought in, and the stock market was firm and rising. Later, Liverpool bought July and August White Lohi. The closing was firm, with Pingol up two rupees, Omra up 2.5 to 3.25 rupees, and White Lohi up 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (13th telegram).</p>
<p>According to the Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for the 15th was: White Lohi was 239 rupees, Omra was 215.25 rupees, and Pingol was 190.5 rupees, all unchanged.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Large Bar Lead Spot Shortage</p>
<p>The market for large bar lead has been scarce in recent arrivals recently, so the circulating goods on the market are unusually thin. Although customers and raw silk dealers have not started, the tea warehouse transactions are very prosperous. As a result, there is a shortage of spot goods on the market. The standard prices are rising steadily. Currently, each load of foreign lead sells for 44 yuan, which is 2 yuan more than the previous price. Each load of domestic lead sells for 41 yuan, which is also 1 yuan more than before. According to foreign firm news, due to the expansion of military preparations in various countries, there have been restrictions on the export of large bar lead. It is feared that the future arrivals will not be many, so the pricing section is extremely vigorous.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Spring</h3>
<p>— (Xu Xiaoting)</p>
<p>Reading the Romance of the Western Chamber to the line "Spring's meaning is horizontal in the eyebrows," we increasingly understand the mystery of spring love, which is very great.</p>
<p>Spring is like a young girl, a young girl's enchanting charm. Sometimes it is far less than the tranquility and charm of spring.</p>
<p>Without the effort of spring, how can there be the harvest of autumn.</p>
<p>The plan for the year lies in spring. Spring's suggestion is to jump and be active, calling on mankind to embrace a vigorous spirit and move forward.</p>
<p>Spring for the poor is like a kind angel, who can call the poor's body to stretch slowly like a caterpillar.</p>
<p>With the arrival of spring, even the ignorant willows and vegetables will add some color to flatter the god of spring.</p>
<p>People cherish spring, and extend it to cherishing the country, so that the country will always retain a vigorous spring atmosphere, so that the country can run on the road of self-improvement.</p>
<h3>Northeast Yangko</h3>
<p>— Xuewen</p>
<p>In the Northeast, every time after the Lunar New Year, in the first month, some people who are relaxing will, as a rule, automatically organize some proletarian entertainment. The most common types are stilt walking, dragon lanterns, and running dry boats, etc.</p>
<p>"Stilt walking" is extremely popular in the Northeast. The people who play it are mostly soldiers or young farmers in the village. The number of people is uncertain, usually thirty or forty! Each of them has a pair of wooden "stilt legs" tied to their feet that are two feet above the ground. They wear various costumes and dress up in different forms, like actors on stage. There are male, female, clown, etc., and most of them are based on old Chinese dramas. The most indispensable ones are of course Bai Suzhen, Xiaoqing, and Xu Xian! Yingying and Zhang Sheng! Little old ladies! Their way of playing is called "singing," mostly popular folk songs. The second is the so-called "twist," which is to make obscene or joking teases to each other! The kind of unscrupulousness, licentiousness, and wantonness will surely be considered by defenders of morality to be harmful to public morals!</p>
<p>"Playing the dragon lantern" is mostly organized by people in the village. The appearance of the dragon is made by using a number of cloths painted with scales and making them into a cylindrical shape outside the bamboo circle, and installing a head and a tail. At night, they put a candle in each of the dragon's abdomen, shining brightly. There are many ways to play. The most important thing is the person holding the dragon head. This is something that can only be done by an experienced old hand. What "playing with the pearl"! "Stirring the river and stirring the sea" makes people see the dragon's constant dancing, just like it is alive, which is extremely interesting, especially lively at night.</p>
<p>"Running a dry boat" is a plaything played by three people, a plaything played by three people. Two people dress up as women, with something that looks like a boat tied to their sides, looking like they are sitting in the boat. Another person is dressed as a clown, holding a pole for punting the boat, running back and forth between the two boats, and teasing the women dressed up, making all kinds of ridiculous actions, and sometimes "singing".</p>
<h3>Guangfu Tiger Roaring Bridge</h3>
<p>— Fu Binglin</p>
<p>It is the season to see plum blossoms again, so naturally I want to recall my hometown of Dengwei. Because of Dengwei, I think of the Tiger Roaring Bridge in Guangfu. "Tiger Creek Sunset" is one of the famous scenic spots in Fuxi. But news came that the bridge suddenly collapsed entirely last month due to years of disrepair; then this year, those who go to Dengwei to explore the plum blossoms will only have a remnant of the site to look at.</p>
<p>The Tiger Roaring Bridge spans the West Yan and is located between Tiger Mountain and Pagoda Mountain. The West Yan is the tail of Taihu Lake, facing the Copper Pit, both of which are places where the water flow is turbulent. Pagoda Mountain leans against the Temple Hamlet Ridge, with a towering peak, hidden as a screen pillow, so the terrain is very majestic. At sunset, the pagoda shadow bridge body, lake light ridge color, mutually reflect, very beautiful. Every March in late spring, Tiger Mountain is full of brilliant red camphor flowers, half the mountain is like fire, competing with the small peach willows along the embankment, which is worth savoring. (Looking from the bridge in the faint morning light, you can see fishing sails dotted in the lake, appearing and disappearing in the smoke and waves.) Once it is dusk, countless fishing boats all drum oars to return, near the mouth of the Tiger Roaring Bridge, because the water flow is turbulent, they naturally make noise and compete to cross, but it is a wonderful picture of fishing boats singing late. East of the bridge was formerly Feng Guifen's reading cottage, but now it has become a relic.</p>
<p>The bridge is entirely stone, and is a three-ring arch style. It was built during the Qianlong period and was donated by a scholar at his own expense. The bridge body has long been tilted. The residents of the twelve villages northwest of Guangfu all entered the town through this bridge. The bridge collapsed at night, and no boat or person was harmed, which is very fortunate. According to the monk in the Tiger Mountain Temple, "Several nights before the bridge collapsed, wailing sounds were heard near the bridge, which was actually a harbinger."</p>
<p>According to old legends: The scholar who donated the bridge had a son in his old age. Grateful to the White-Robed Avalokitesvara, he made a vow to build this bridge. But after spending countless wooden stakes, the project could not hit the pile site of the bridge well. In the end, he planned to sacrifice himself. Avalokitesvara was moved by him, so he gave him a dream, saying to him: "Tomorrow morning, a leper beggar will pass by here, you can sincerely seek help from him." The next morning, a leper beggar came from afar. The scholar knelt on the ground to ask for help, but the leper beggar ignored him. The scholar was so anxious that he kowtowed until his head bled, and the beggar then ordered the scholar to buy three catties of high-quality southern dates. After the dates were bought, the leper beggar sighed and said, "The fate of the bridge is like this." He only cared about eating the dates, and threw a date pit into the lake. After eating, he flicked his sleeves and left suddenly. Looking at the shore beach, 107 solid and strong jujube wood piles had been driven well. Originally, 108 bridge piles were needed, but the person who bought the dates ate one, so there was one less bridge pile, and the bridge was a little tilted after it was built. The villagers also said that whoever took a picture of the bridge could not get the bridge straight. In fact, on the one hand, the position (unless photographed on a boat) is oblique, and on the other hand, the bridge itself is slightly inclined, so naturally the correct image of the bridge cannot be photographed. The Guangfu District Office is planning to rebuild a steel and cement bridge, but I wonder if they can find that leper monk again?</p>
<h3>Changing Nest Luan Feng (Mythical Bird)</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 11 (Whispered Words Touched the Compassionate Heart; Repentance and Filial Piety; Autumn Light Dimmed Emerald Green; Moved by the Scene, Writing to Express Feelings)</p>
<p>Today was different. After taking a distant glance, he walked over and stopped. Although he only paused for a few seconds, it was clear to Guoqi that he had stopped because he saw him. Guoqi thought, perhaps he had something he couldn't suppress and wanted to confide in someone, so he would stand still and listen to what he had to say. Guoqi had just formed this thought and hadn't even fully stopped when Menglan lowered her head and slowly walked away, step by step. Guoqi indeed stood still in the middle of the alley, lost in thought as he watched Menglan's retreating figure. He recalled how composed her face was, her eyes fixed, her eyelashes drooping, and her eyebrows tightly knitted together. He also remembered that even though she usually didn't wear makeup, her snow-white skin had a rosy glow, as if she had lightly applied powder. But just now, her face had been somewhat pale, and the rosy glow had completely faded. Seeing her like this, the sadness in her heart seemed to have brewed to a great extent. Having not received a letter from Er Ye for several days, it was clear that it wasn't because she had become distant towards him, but entirely due to the pressure of her environment and her own feelings. If they had already exchanged words, he feared that upon meeting today, she would have countless grievances to pour out. Couldn't he see her slightly curved eyebrows trembling, and tears welling up in the corners of her eyes? So, he shook his head a few times, sighed, and then slowly walked home. After arriving home, he didn't speak to anyone, lowered the curtain at the door, and paced back and forth in the room with his hands behind his back. When he grew tired, he sat down and held the Venus statue on the desk in both hands, turning it around and around, just looking at it. Then he put the statue down and said to himself, "In the feudal era, both Western and Chinese thought were the same. In Chinese mythology, Chang'e in the moon married the tyrant Hou Yi. In Western mythology, Venus married the god of misfortune. This is not accidental; the poets and literati who witnessed this tragedy entrusted deep feelings to it." So, he placed the idol back where it was, moved a She inkstone to the front, took out an ancient inkstick, and slowly ground it. As he ground the ink, he looked out the window. On the brick platform of the window, there were several pots of large-leaved begonias in full bloom. By the edge of the bulrush pot on the desk, a cutting of white chrysanthemums was inserted in a small purple vase, the delicate petals just about to open, filling the desk with the atmosphere of autumn.

<h3>Cherishing the Plum Blossom</h3>
<p>— Written by Ziming</p>
<p>During this vacation period for all flowers, nature is naturally desolate and lonely; but the plum blossoms in the courtyard stubbornly endure the wind and cold, and the yellow stamens gradually, shyly, bloom into flowers; that elegant and clear fragrance constantly wafts into the nose, instantly refreshing the spirit.</p>
<p>Feeling cold indoors, I placed a recliner in the courtyard, lay down on it, facing the sun, and the heat naturally transmitted to my body; while reading books and newspapers, the plum blossoms seemed to understand my inner thoughts, sending their fragrance over; flattering? Comforting? I can only feel pleasant. And I reluctantly plucked one or two blossoms and put them in my nose.</p>
<p>Its fragrance is not limited to one corner; it also splashes out, first arousing the curiosity of the children, who constantly come to visit it; after paying their respects, each person holds a flower in their hand. Soon, many young ladies also come to patronize it; after an afternoon passes, what about the plum blossoms? Only a withered stump remains. When I realized this, the matter was a foregone conclusion, and there was no way to save it; the lovely plum blossoms were all sacrificed. It's over. Alas! If it had no color and fragrance, perhaps it wouldn't have suffered such great harm! The plum blossom is our national flower. Seeing it trampled upon makes me even more worried about the future of the great Chinese nation.</p>

<h3>Reasoning</h3>
<p>— (Chonglou)</p>
<p>Reasoning means understanding principles.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, while I was getting a haircut, the barber told me that he was planning to bring his family to Shanghai to live with him. He said that he had been working for more than ten years and had saved some money. Now he could earn several tens of yuan each month, which would be enough to maintain a simple life. So, I gave him a lecture on the principles of "life requires hardship before sweetness" and "managing a household requires living within one's means." I also told him, "I am always reasoning. In fact, a person cannot live in this world without principles. When children are in swaddling clothes, they are nurtured by their parents, which is the principle of teaching them to grow. When they enter school, they are taught by teachers, which is the principle of teaching them how to live in the world. Later, when they enter society to work, they cannot be separated from the principle of service. For example, as a barber, you also have the principle of barbering. Principles are to people what rails are to vehicles. A person who doesn't reason is like a vehicle that has derailed, which is very dangerous!"</p>
<h3>Tianjin Mush</h3>
<p>— (Xidan)</p>
<p>Mentioning "Tianjin Mush" may seem a bit unfamiliar. Fortunately, this is not a specialized term; it's just a "catchphrase" of Lin Yutang's elder brother, Lin Yulin.</p>
<p>When he was studying in the United States, he saw lively children and constantly praised them with "Tianjin Mush"! "Tianjin Mush!" I remember last year when he taught English at the senior high school department of Datong Middle School, his teaching method was always to treat the large students as children. If the pronunciation was not very accurate, he would make you read it ten or twenty times, until the students hated it and desperately read it, stopping only when they pronounced it accurately. Then he would again say "Tianjin Mush" repeatedly, expressing his joy. What Mr. Lin meant by "Tianjin Mush" was the Fujianese phrase for "innocent and carefree" (天真爛漫).</p>
<h3>Planting Flowers and Cultivating Flowers</h3>
<p>— (Chen Tianci)</p>
<p>In spring, flowers often bloom later due to the cold, so those who plant flowers must use manure water to irrigate them, so that the flowers can bloom easily.</p>
<p>In addition, when people want to cut flowers and insert them in a vase for display, they must use four parts water and three parts wine, so that the flowers can last longer and wither later.</p>
<p>The above two methods are my experience in planting and cultivating flowers for several years. I think there are many readers who love flowers now, and they should use the above methods when planting or cultivating flowers because they are simple and easy to do.</p>
<h3>Simplified Characters and Engraving Artisans</h3>
<p>— (Zhen Lü)</p>
<p>Recently, people have been advocating simplified characters, and scholars are arguing for and against them. The Ministry of Education has already issued a list of standard characters, but then suddenly stopped it, leaving everyone at a loss! Looking back at ancient times, before there were pens, writing was done by engraving. People disliked the complexity of the characters, so the writing evolved from Great Seal Script to Small Seal Script to Clerical Script, simplifying as it progressed. As the use of documents became more frequent, and the dissemination of information was not as convenient as it is now with movable type printing, every stroke of the characters on the printing blocks had to be done by engraving artisans. The artisans were paid by the job and sought to be fast. So, they adopted the principle of being discernible and not harming the meaning of the words, using simpler characters with the same sound, or omitting radicals, or creating similar shapes, to replace the complex and laborious forms. The gentlemen, concerned about their work, tolerated and accommodated them, and did not criticize them. Those who wrote for convenience also followed suit, changing the original characters even more drastically, and simplified characters proliferated! It is a pity that in the pursuit of change, they inevitably harmed the words, and harmed the meaning, as the saying goes: "Haste makes waste" and "Trying to untangle silk only makes it more tangled!" The Ministry of Education's sudden change of plan is probably due to reconsidering the inconvenience. Those who started this trend were the lazy engraving artisans, and that has consequences; isn't that backwards?</p>
<h3>Li Gong Chop Suey</h3>
<p>— (Ying)</p>
<p>There is a famous Cantonese dish called "Li Gong Chop Suey." The origin of this dish's name has a rather interesting story. Overseas Chinese are all able to talk about it with relish. This matter has been passed down for a long time and is now old news, not worth mentioning, but because the story is extremely interesting, I am recording it here.</p>
<p>Li Jinzhang (李津章) was very fond of Cantonese cuisine. When he was an envoy to the United States, he invited American friends to a Cantonese restaurant for a late-night snack. However, it was too late, and all the dishes had already been sold out. All that was left were small, leftover pieces that could not be made into complete dishes. However, Li and his American friends did not want to return disappointed, so they ordered the cook to mix and stir-fry whatever was available to satisfy their hunger. The cook obeyed and stir-fried two large plates with the leftover pieces of char siu, roast duck, pork belly, sea cucumber, preserved meat, bean sprouts, etc., to serve these distinguished guests. However, this was only a temporary solution and had never been tried before. Unexpectedly, the distinguished guests recognized the quality and praised the dish as a delicious delicacy, showering the chef with praise. Local overseas Chinese spread the story as a good tale. Later, various Cantonese restaurants followed suit and added this dish, named "Li Gong Chop Suey." This is the origin of "Li Gong Chop Suey" in Cantonese cuisine.</p>

<h3>Three "I Also Think So"</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>The language of diplomats is often ambiguous and vague, only mentioning abstract outlines and not making concrete statements. Therefore, a diplomat's remarks can be interpreted in many ways. It can be interpreted this way, and it can be interpreted that way. Therefore, those who are not good at making slippery arguments cannot be diplomats, because if the wording is too affirmative, they will have difficulty extricating themselves in the future.</p>
<p>That being said, if someone asks you about a certain diplomatic event, even though the diplomat cannot give a definitive answer, they must still express an abstract outline. This is also the attitude that a diplomat should have. According to a news report yesterday, a foreign journalist visited the spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry and asked whether Foreign Minister Sato's speech in the House of Peers meant that Japan had changed its attitude and would respect all international agreements signed by Japan. The spokesperson casually replied, "I also think so." The journalist then asked about the Nine-Power Treaty. The spokesperson replied, "I also think so." The journalist further asked about Japan's guarantee of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity within the treaty. The spokesperson replied again, "I also think so." These three "I also think so" can be said to have exhausted the art of sophistry. The answer is equivalent to no answer, and the saying is equivalent to not saying anything.</p>
<p>Suppose someone asked a friend, "Have you eaten yet?" and the friend replied, "I also think so." Then asked, "Do you have official business after eating?" and the friend replied, "I also think so." And then asked, "How about I treat you to dinner tonight?" and the friend again replied, "I also think so," then the friend would definitely be angry, considering it to be contemptuous and insulting. Now, this spokesperson answers with one "I also think so" after another, which is too sophistical. In the Surangama Sutra, there are many "Thus have I heard," but now this spokesperson has many "I also think so." This person must be well-versed in Buddhist scriptures. It is sometimes annoying for reporters to press hard, but dealing with them in this way ultimately amounts to losing one's own dignity in terms of politeness for the spokesperson.</p>
<p>However, when the reporters asked whether the Asahi Shimbun's revelation about the Japanese Foreign Ministry's attitude towards Foreign Minister Wang was accurate, the spokesperson replied that in principle, there should be no problem, because so-called equality and reciprocity are principles recognized by international law, but specific issues involving Eastern Hebei and Chahar should be regarded as another matter. This statement is incomprehensible, because Eastern Hebei and Chahar are also important international issues. Why are these issues not within the principles recognized by international law and are considered another matter? If the Eastern Hebei and Chahar incidents are considered another matter, then what cannot be an exception? Where is the principle recognized by international law?</p>
<p>A certain diplomat once said that China only cares about face and does not ask about reality, as long as the face is good, they will agree. Therefore, it is feared that there will be problems with whether Sato's speech, the so-called economic cooperation and so-called equal treatment, can be carried out in accordance with these principles in reality. Therefore, in addition to duck diplomacy, they now also have face diplomacy. This is also a new trick in international negotiations. We Chinese people should understand the truth about so-called equal treatment and so-called economic cooperation, unite as one, pool our wisdom and efforts, and jointly devise a method to deal with it. This is what our Chinese people should deeply understand.</p>
<h3>Elegy on the River</h3>
<p>— Ruizhi</p>
<p>——The Boat Girls of the Min River</p>
<p>The setting sun is sinking, and the red glow of the horizon is reflected on the peach-red river water. The gentle waves weave a golden, long practice, which is the beauty of the Min River at dusk.</p>
<p>At this time, the "Ketee" (Note 1) boat girls are stopping their operations, shaking the wooden pulp, and swimming to the gathered river bank. The sound of 𠸄 ya 𠸄 ya, like a song of gratitude to the sun, flies from the heart of the river to the vast sky.</p>
<p>The boats, wooden boats painted in deep red (Note 2), are arranged in rows, like beads in an abacus, one connected to another, densely close to the shore covered with green water plants. An old woman climbed from the cabin to the stern and lit the fire of the evening meal, praying softly to the sky (Note 3). The children were running in groups to the fields and orchards on the shore. The young boat girls changed out of their worn-out clothes of the day in the cabin, wiped away the sweaty smell that flowed from their work, applied fragrant powder, put on new clothes, combed their hair, waved red and green wildflowers, walked out of the cabin door, and sat on the bow of the boat, waiting for the arrival of the night.</p>
<p>During the day, at the ferry, under the pier, all day long in the blowing of the wind and the exposure to the sun, carrying luggage for the guests, carrying heavy goods, gasping for breath, sweating, the boat girls who have no moment of rest, at this time, one by one, like beautiful palace maids, sitting on the bow of the boat hanging with red cloth curtains, talking and laughing loudly, singing mountain songs in a low voice, they are waiting for the arrival of the night's guests (Note 4).</p>
<p>The moon is shining in the high sky, and the water in the Min River, the ripples are like silver, and the lights are shooting from the boats on the shore, shining in the heart of the river, like the stars in the sky. At this time, there is a sound of laughter and madness from men and women in some cabins, and some are playing clear and bright singing sounds.</p>
<p>When the night is deep, the four fields and space have all returned to silence. At this time, the sound of laughter has stopped, and the sound of happy songs has also disappeared in people's ears. The only thing flying in the night sky is the sad tone, neither singing nor weeping, but the low sigh of the boat girls, maybe they are secretly hating Ming Taizu hundreds of years ago (Note 5), maybe complaining about their own destiny.</p>
<p>When the sky is bright, the boat girls are all haggard, picking up the wooden pulp again, and starting to do their tireless work all day long. Maybe when recalling the pain in the night, they will complain about the uncompetitive men in the clan (Note 6). However, in an instant, the burden of life is pressing on their shoulders again. For the sake of life, for the survival of the race, they have to forget the hidden pain in their hearts and do their work at the ferry and under the pier.</p>
<p>Operating for life during the day, sweating, gasping for breath, and being destroyed for life at night, suffering pain, and being oppressed, "Who can know the suffering of the boat girls on the Min River" among human beings? (Note 7).</p>
<p>(Note 1), "Ketee" is the name of the race, such as Miao Yao, etc., belonging to races other than the Han Chinese. The "Ketee" race is only found in the Min River in China.</p>
<p>(Note 2) The red boat on the Min River is owned by the "Ketee" people. It is said that Ming Taizu gave them a specific color to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>(Note 3) The old women in the boat are all the masters of the boat, and they must pray to God every night to bless them with guests coming to the boat to spend the night.</p>
<p>(Note 4) The boat girls are all prostitutes. It is said that there is a rule in the clan that every woman must be a prostitute for nine years before she can marry. The so-called night guests are prostitutes.</p>
<p>(Note 5) According to legend, in the Ming Dynasty, the "Ketee" clan forcibly occupied the Min-Min area of Fujian and killed countless Han people. Therefore, Ming Taizu sent troops to conquer them, and later ordered that the "Ketee" people were not allowed to go ashore to work for a living, but only to live on the Min River. Therefore, until now, they can only be boat girls.</p>
<p>(Note 6) The "Ketee" men, suffering from the oppression of the Han people, and unable to make a living on land, mostly go to Nanyang to make a living, so the red boats in the Min River are full of women, and men are very few.</p>
<p>(Note 7) This is a sentence from their mountain song. From this sentence, we can know what their lives are like.</p>
<h3>Dreams Under the Pen</h3>
<p>— Wang Rendong</p>
<p>——Adult's Fairy Tales</p>
<p>"My pen fell asleep and had some beautiful dreams in the spring; and vaguely uttered some delirium. It sounds very nice, like singing a song; but when I wake up, most of it has faded in my memory, but it can still be recorded, but when you look at it, you must use a dream-weaving shuttle to weave and mend the sparse places; then you can make it look as if it has not faded as before; otherwise, you can only see this broken piece of it!"</p>
<p>Spring is coming:</p>
<p>In my silent and depressed heart, a pot of milky warm water was sprinkled, - like mercury spilling on the ground. The heart is holding it and rippling.</p>
<p>It may also be a few wild grasses bursting out from the cracks in the stones under the corner of the wall, or sticking on a spot of moss.</p>
<p>If a fat and slippery centipede crawls under the corner of the wall, you may suspect that it is carrying the news of spring, and leaving its shadow along the way; because the silver lines left behind are like small white rice-shaped flowers blooming on the silence and on the ridges.</p>
<p>Wild grasses and moss are willing to spread, and will quickly crawl over the stone cracks; or make a deep and dense clump, hiding the stones and the corners of the walls. Deep and dense, there will be more centipedes carrying spring news; sometimes there will be a poisonous snake, red eyes, triangular head, and flame-striped tongue; that is also uncertain!</p>
<p>I am afraid of snakes when I think of them. What if some wild grasses and mosses are also spread deeply and densely in the corners of my heart in the spring? That won't happen, will there be a poisonous snake too? Centipedes are fine, they will draw silver lines, like small rice-colored flowers blooming. Small flowers are very interesting, fragrant and warm, maybe there are grasshoppers or field mice in fairy tales.</p>
<p>Let's bloom some small flowers!</p>
<p>To bloom flowers, you have to sow seeds. After sowing seeds, you want rain. The rain and mud are slippery and moisten the soil layer, and the seeds in the soil layer will bud out into small buds, and then grow leaves, grow up and bloom.</p>
<p>"Don't you see the sun?"</p>
<p>"You can let the seeds wrap in depression and darkness, and trying to be depressed will promote the collapse of its heart, and then stretch out buds to see the sun!</p>
<p>Rain is also the most capable of making silence and depression.</p>
<p>Silence, silence.</p>
<p>Depression, depression.</p>
<p>Will collapse, will germinate, will bloom!</p>

<h3>Afterthoughts</h3>
<p>The news about the Manlu Art Company published in the eleventh issue of this newspaper is not only inconsistent with the facts, but also contains a divisive nature. The Nightingale Art Company has not been "affected" by the duties of each person, so that it cannot "rejuvenate," and there is no so-called "unwillingness to succumb to the threat of the environment" to form other groups. The reason why the Nightingale Art Company cannot recover for a while is only due to the time issue of slightly different opinions among each individual. There is no talk of "threats" or "not threats." Fearing that the outside world may not understand the truth, this statement is made. Nightingale Art Company</p>
