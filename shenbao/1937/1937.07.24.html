<h3>日侵略華北實出豫謀</h3>
<p>字林報云、此次蘆溝橋事變、日本非僅僅希圖解决河北省華軍而已焉、此為回溯往事可以知之、九一八事變以後、日本計晝．依其程序、逐步發展、而向當日之中東鐵路彼方、漸漸深人、例如一九三一年十一月、日本曾切實聲明决不越過路、甚至謂與溥儀毫無關係、乃至月杪即攻擊齊齊哈爾、次年四月、竟建“滿洲國、”而以溥儀為君主、旣而正式宣布不欲攫取熱河、乃是年冬季、復併吞該省、及冀省之一部分、而北寗路綫達山海關之地一隅亦被襄括、至是乃進窺察省、一九三五年之夏、更藉端成立冀東“自治政府、”而闢不設軍備區域、一九三六年冬季、又藉蒙兵之叛　、求逞於綏遠、因傳軍奮男抗禦、而未得利、但是年九月、已藉細故而估有豐台、於是北寗平綏兩路之控制權乃全人日人之掌握矣、本年六月二十九日、蘇聊日本外交代表正在討論畫分黑龍江諸島雙方土地權利之際、適本間陸軍中將自英參與英皇加冕禮後回國、道出哈爾濱、該中將富有經騐、敏於斷事、夙為日人所欽佩、有造訪訽以蘇聯軍車者、據答、蘇聯陸軍、因史丹林之淸黨、大受搖動、今實際不足介意云、是於七月一日日本對黑龍江之要求、遂取強硬方針、未幾、雖經雙方讓步而獲解决、實則殊不利於蘇聯也、七月第一星期、北平即有日軍將有異動之種種流言、人心頗為不靖、果於七月七日日軍在蘆溝橋附近演戰之際激成今日之事變、日本關於中國腹地最為關切者、乃在佔據滿洲所盼得之經濟利益欲求此項利益之鞏固、必求能抵禦蘇聯攻擊而後可、雖在目前、如本間中將之所云、不必以此為懼、然他日蘇聯難保不與日本為敵、故今日乃乘蘇聯不遑外顧之幾、力求使自黑龍江起至綏遠止一綫之左翼根深蒂固、毫無破綻、而後乃可專心從事彼所最注重之經濟問題、此舉當使“滿洲國”與華北成經濟單位、“滿洲國”茍與華北無直接貿易關係、則不能獲佔據其地之利益、河北與其地北區域、天然利源、甚為豐富、日本之意、一旦能掌握此種利源、不特佔據滿洲之經濟成功可以達到目的、而內國之經濟需要亦可高枕無憂矣、故日本今日所得在華北境內屯集大軍之機會、似為處心積慮所造成、以圖藉以再割中國重要之士地一大隅耳、謂此次事變非出預謀、眞類掩耳盜鈴也、日本外交政策、今又為軍人之野心一度戰勝、活劇或又將開始也、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>開和平的幻覺</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>最近數日來。由於產瀉橋我軍的撤退。華北表面上的局勢似乎由緊張而漸趨於和緩。於是有人覺得時局最嚴重的階段。業已過去。我們已經避免戰爭而求得和平了。這種僥倖希求和平的心理。表現於公債市場的趨向。以及目前平津形勢的受人忽視。而在實際上。這樣對於和平的幻覺。也正是我們抗敵救亡運動中一個極大的危機</p>
<p>我們應當指出。在蘆構橋衛突最初爆發。我們英勇的二十九軍堅守國土。奮死殺敵。激起全國民眾一致應援的時候。我們正把握著抗敵救亡最有利和最可樂觀的條件。但是這以攘經過敵人慫次假意的停戰。向關外及他們國內調徵大批援兵。又接逴背約轟炸平郊及宛平。同時脅使冀察當局有津舉行談判。接受屆辱的條件。到現在。這些屆辱條件已在一一實行。這時候。我們雖見到平津表面上漸趨和緩的空氣。實際上卻正表示著我們民族的又一奇恥大辱。業已造成。而在最近的將來。華北萬分險急的局勢。將更加迅速的展開。</p>
<p>我們只要想。十萬日軍業已集中河北。他們會迅速撤退回去嗎。天津郵權被干涉。塘沽碼頭被佔據。全部北寗路被刦奪。河北將成一個怎樣的局面。還有忠勇抗敵的二十九軍馮治安部。被調離平。平西八實山險要地帶。又由保安隊接防。這樣對於忠勇抗敵的將士。將是何等痛心的打擊。而偌大的舊都北平並無我軍守衛。任合敵軍橫行。換言之。平市將成冀東化。此種發展又是何等嚴重。而且。十七師移駐涿州。蘆溝橋這個軍事要站。又將綴覺台之後。成為日軍控制的目的物。今後平漢路的北端又入菸敵人之手。晉西冀南的形勢將是如何的岌岌可危。</p>
<p>上述各點。興十七日蔣委員長談話中所聲明我們國家的最後四點立場。也無不絕對相背。這種局勢。顯然是我們全國人民所不能忍受的。目前日人所依據的。為十九日他們與張自忠在天津所訂的恊定這恊定。內容並沒有發表。但日方以為過去日方興冀察地方當局所訂酌恊定。都已得中央的承認。所以這次的恊定自然也不成間題。這種荒謬絕倫的說法。我國政府應加以最嚴厲的駁斥。</p>
<p>我們以為過去種損壞我國領土主權的恊定。都不能加以承認。而這次日方威脅冀察當局所訂立之恊定。尤當立即加以駁斥二十九軍忠勇部險的被調遷。北平抗敵數亡活動的受阻遏。十萬侵略者軍隊的被容許停留在我國境內。將造成未來華北非常嚴重的危機。這時候。每個中國的人民都不能存有絲毫和平的幻覺。我們認為侵略者在華北所造成的險急局勢。已經到了我們忍受的最後關頭。我們必須集中上下的一切力量。對侵略者這種剝奪華北的陰謀。加以迎頭的打擊。</p>

<h3>英國一味縱容促成日本侵略</h3>
<p>俄報著論備加指責　中國抵抗力量增強</p>
<p>［莫斯科］真理報云、“日本在華北的侵略、對于其他資本主義國家的利益、當然為重大打擊、而尤以英國受害最甚、然而吾人必須指出英政府無論對于遠東或歐洲的侵略者、實均採取妥恊縱容政策、而此政策、例如最近英日談判之開始、實斷然有利于日帝國主義的侵略計畫、華北方面自前事件、乃為日本在大陸上準備大戰之一部份、故必須加以嚴重注意也”、（廿二日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］消息報撰文痛論華北事伴之意義、首稱、“一九三七年七月的事件、與一九三一年、“九一八、”日本強佔滿洲事伴頗有相同之點、此不難指出、日本與六年前相同、方調集大軍恫嚇中國、同時則償飾鎮靜、冀減輕列強之注意、此意義深長的類似點、使消息雲通的觀察家深覺目前的華北事件、不過係日帝國主義業經長期佈置周全的征服中國第二階段計畫之初步、“九一八”、時日本佔領滿洲之成功、乃西歐列強採取消極態度之結果、此毫無疑間之事、而英國之公開縱容、尤為促成日本侵略之主因、彼時一部份英國政客完全錯估還東勢力之交互闢係、以為日本佔領滿洲後、將不向華化華中而向他方發展、今日英國乃復有採取－九三一年時立場之傾向、此誠非常可悲可異者也、</p>
<p>“英國保守黨報紙現在與六年前相同、仍然企圖輕視華北事件、似以為興他國利益無關、換言之、卽彼等竟乃支持日方軍閥惜以掩飾其準備周到的軍事行動之口實、英國保守黨現正在遠東重施過去不但在遠東並在東菲及西歐早已失敗之政策、保守黨政客顯已為虛張聲勢及威嚇之手段所懾服、而不問此積手段係來自遠東抑中歐、”</p>
<p>消息報繼指出一九三一年時日本會宣佈其侵略僅限于滿洲境內、然結果則完全背約、橫之以估領熱河、創造冀東保儡“政府”、強迫建立所謂冀察政委會、奪取察北六縣、“今者、日本乃績間武力估領華北平津、進步變準備武力侵入華中、而其在台灣等地之活動、更切實證明華南亦在整侵略計畫之內、“形勢如此、而仍企圖邀得日方軍閥之承諾、使其業已開始的據張計畫局部代、尚有何用、有日本肯放棄其侵略計簽者、則惟有在某一政府停止縱容此種計劃之時而已”、</p>
<p>消息報當延述英外次克蘭波動爵會于一九三七年五月間否認英國、“意欲不尊重中國之主權”、從而問曰、“英國目前之抹殺華北事伴的極端重要性、其意義豈非謂英國不尊重中國主權乎、不僅此也、其意義甚至可謂英國已在放寨其在華利益、同時並顯示倫敦對于遠東勢力的交互關係、乃重復估計錯誤耳、”</p>
<p>最後消息報論及一九三七年七月八日事件、興六年前、“九一八”事件本質上之不同稱、“卽不提蘇聯國力加強多倍之一決定因素、亦有兩點應與指出、六年以來中國人民之抗日運動已非常發展、而日本之後方則反因六年之冒險政策、而大為削弱興騷亂、目前日本物價之高漲、罷工浪潮之擴大、財救之困難以及其他多次因素、證明此次對華侵略新階段之展開、乃在國內形勢異常不穩定之條件下、別方面自新中日衝突爆發以來、吾人卽眼見中國抗日運動之愈益堅強為發展、同時民族意識以及人民對侵略者憤恨亦極端發發揚、</p>
<p>數年以前、英國的立場事實上曾決定日本的勝利、今者巖重的時機又已來臨、世界列強尤其是英國、已復須採決肯定的立場矣、華北事件以及列強對該事件的態度、其將成為國際形勢中最重要之因素乎”、（二十二日塔斯社電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］關於華北事件發生後、英政府現及力激請美國共同出任調停、據“晚報”載、法國對此項行動、亦將參加、但成功希望、極為薄弱、因除美國未必參加調停外、日政府對於任何干涉、均抱怨厲拒絕態度、據悉日駐英大使肝向英外相艾登鄭重申明、請如在此危急開頭、日本政府竟接受任何外力調停之辦法、則必引起全國人民公憤、而將政府傾覆云、（二十三日國民海通電）</p>

<h3>僑厦日台人之動態</h3>

<h3>街頭的沙袋撤除了</h3>
<p>北平通信、昨晚從輔仁大學美籍神父口中、聽到美國領事館傳出來的消息、說明天（二十）是緊要關頭、可是十幾天來、已經養成不輕易相信的習慣了、十五日聽說對方猛攻擊、十七日聽說對方提出最後通牒、限二十四小時內軍隊撤退、但戰爭迄未爆發、局面一味鬱悶、前些日子一度傳說某鐵路局長被扣、昨天又傳說某市長住宅被炸、都未見事實、只可見人心所向而已、事寶上這爾位要人是奔走和平最有力量的分子、</p>
<p>一禮拜都在城裹奔忙、今天（十九）要出城看看、十點半出去、西直鬥還是只開半扇、旁邊堆著許多沙袋、夜間戒嚴以後、這沙袋面就是站滿丁擱檢待放的二十九軍弟兄、郊外大道、還是太平景象、只看見幾個往城裹搬家的、到了清華園、才聽說昨天校西放了一夜的槍礮、是西苑軍營西邊、紅山口有便衣隊搗亂、校裹大致還很安靜、可也有帶著行李離校的、我因爲願意時刻在北平城裹注意事變每分鐘的發展、恐怕被關在城外、不能參加偉大的場面、所以午飯後、就乘一點鐘車回城裹來、</p>
<p>校車經過西四牌樓、旁邊的二十九軍兵土、正在搬動沙袋、自從蘆溝橋開礮之後、北平各城門各重要街口、就都堆上了沙袋、十天來沙袋有增無減、從最初排一行沙袋、只可臥在後面一袋袋加上去、漸漸可以跪射、可以掩蔽機關槍、到現在可以立在後面射擊、而且旁邊挖着寬深的壞溝了、我看着二十九軍弟兄都只穿着白襯衣在那裹忙碌、心上湧出感謝的敬意、想到前天昨天、還有幾位朋友自動去帮忙他們把沙袋疊高、就跟同車的同學說、我們應該下去帮忙他們，這可以給他們以相當鼓勵、這樣說着、校車已經駛過去了、</p>
<p>下車走到各界民眾抗敵後援會的情報部、一位朋友先就用歡息的口氣招呼、‘消息壞了’、</p>
<p>‘是不是明天敵人總攻擊’、我聯想到昨天聽來的消息、不料得到的答覆卻是、‘那倒好了、消息是我們接受了條件、街上沙袋都撤了’、</p>
<p>我還告訴他們、不要輕信、因為我剛在街上看好像是往上加沙袋、但是另一位說他剛才特地騎車到東城西城大街看了一遍、的確是往下撤我只好承認自己看得疏忽了、院子裹幾個人在那裹發牢騷生氣、屋子裹情報、卻仍舊得發出去、‘和平、還是屈辱’一行大字、下面是‘傳中日協定已在津簽字’、‘北平街頭沙袋在撤除中……’、幾天來這裹面有敎授先生們都一起在作後援會工作、熱又忙、現在卻澆了一盆冷水、</p>
<p>宋委員長回北平了、路過豐台、日本兵還致敬禮呢、來到北平、否認說簽字了”、一位報告着、</p>
<p>‘也許還否認吧’、另一位接着、‘街上人看見撤沙袋、都說一聲‘完了’、可是口氣都不同、有的是痛心、有的是放下了、</p>
<p>‘我們算是忙了還些天、以後一定不准幹了’、第三個預言着、‘二十九军哥們、不知道怎么樣呢、砍過敵人也受過傷、堆過沙袋佈過崗、現在可是得自己再拆下來、還得退出北平城這口氣怎麼忍受得下去’、</p>
<p>我想到了在衛戌醫院的無數傷兵、尤其是二個十七幾的二十九軍兵士、他們一面咬牙唉聲地哼呌、一面給我們講他用‘大刀片兒’削了不少腦袋、眞痛快、還有那位阜成門的排長、他挺着胸脯跟我們訓話的神氣、‘我們當軍人的願意上前綫拼命、希望你們諸位在後方照看’，是那麼神氣、那麼有他說嘴的、可是現在我不忍想到他們那些英勇的抗戰、壯烈的犧牲、與奮的樣子了、</p>
<p>走出後援會、我坐在人力車上想、十幾天來我放棄了寫作、打破了日常生活、現在又恢復了、我們還得忍下這口氣、把這口怒氣化爲蘊蓄的力、等待更猛烈的爆發、眼前我還得執起張來首先是報告這些事情、致敬於民族戰亡的二十九軍弟兄、</p>
<p>路過西四牌樓、果然沙袋撇除了、清道去在用條帶掃除街旁的灰土、</p>
<p>可是北寗鐵路營業所和中國旅行社門前、還有大批大批的行李箱籠在裝運着、我想着、這消息他們聽到了、是痛心還是快樂呢、（七月十九日下午）</p>

<h3>江浙禁運乾繭滬各絲廠發生恐慌</h3>
<p>絲廠業公會昨開會議　决請求兩省當局撤禁</p>
<p>江浙兩省、自將滬市各絲廠、向各該省訂購之乾繭、禁止禁止出境後、本市各絲廠、殊為恐慌、昨日下午六時、本市絲廠業公會、及四區六區、絲業工會、特召開聯席會議、洽商請求江浙兩省當局、撤銷禁令、並開閘北之和寨•源昌•二廠、以原料告絕、停止開車、茲志各情如下、</p>
<p>存底僅供兩週之用</p>
<p>本市各絲廠原新、悉係江浙兩省所供給、每日所需乾繭、約在六百據左右、而目前本市乾繭存底、雖各廠多寡不一、但平均估計不過僅供二星期之用、故一旦江浙方面、將乾繭禁運來滬、本市各絲廠勢難持久、</p>
<p>禁止裝運交涉無效</p>
<p>按本市絲廠、在閘北區及新閘山最多數全市絲廠總數共四十四家、絲車約一萬零四百八十四輛、工人約有萬左右、自江浙兩省禁止乾繭出境後、本市各絲廠均極恐慌並聞本市業絲廠、在無錫已訂購之乾繭、亦被蘇省當局所禁止裝運、雖經交涉、尚未見效、</p>
<p>江浙兩省禁運原因</p>
<p>此次江浙兩省禁運出境之原因、一則因該兩省、本年所產乾繭不多、是否是敷兩省絲廠所用、須待調查詳實後、方可分曉、將來如有、多餘、方准出境、則因過去運滬乾繭每多販運出口以致國内乾繭存底日益稀少、江浙两省当局、為维護本國絲業、並調臨國內絲繭供應起見、特爲暫禁出境、</p>
<p>影響所及兩廠停車</p>
<p>聞本市閘北橫浜路、顧家灣和泰、及源昌工絲廠、存底無多、自經江浙禁繭出口後、來源告絕、故將自今日越停止開車、該工廠工人、約有五百餘人、昨日該工廠當局、特分別函知六區總絲業工會、及絲廠同業工會、</p>
<p>聯席會議决定請願</p>
<p>昨日下午六時、本市絲廠業同業公會執行委員維持原料委員、曁六區四區經絲業工會代表、在絲廠業同業工會會所、舉行聯席會議、除報告江浙二省禁運乾繭出境、及本市各絲廠情形外、並决定發表聲明、及向江浙兩省當局、本市政府曁中央政府講願、維護本市絲業及工人生計、至八時許始散會、</p>

<h3>海洋運輸現勢</h3>
<p>現有輪船噸位供過於求</p>
<p>據航業界消息、日前世界海運費之增高、已為各國一致之事實、惟據倫敦航業公會宣稱現所增高之程度猶不足以抵償海運之開支、該運會上年報告、嘗稱世界海運界之活動、雖足與噸位之需要相消長、海運費用、亦幾達一九二九年之標準、第行船及修造費用則不斷增高、因此各航商對於折舊及開支項、莫不胥受無法彌補之苦更證辯物價指數則一九三六年七月至一九三七年一月間、海洋運費平均增高百分之五八、惟是項增高程度、猶僅及一九二〇年間之二分之一、最近鋼鐵市場之飛躍當爲海運費用增高之主因、蓋英法德比日諸邦需求鋼鐵絕無止境、即夏季數月間才需要量而論、各方早有鋼鐵之杞憂、供不應求、其價遂賺而以鋼鐵爲骨龫之輪隻成本、遂亦一躍而增加倍蓗、甚至碎鐵仍項、亦遭遇同樣影響、然一方面中國現有噸位、本感不足航商夙有供應難周之慮、近復因多數船隻相率遷地營業、以圖較厚之利潤、其剩餘之船、更不敷貨運之需要矣、綜上情形、則出租船隻者、乃爲獲益最豐之幸運兒矣、</p>

<h3>一九三七年惠勃爾登網球大會（十一）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐歐記者列山</p>
<p>第九日</p>
<p>男子單打最後的四人勃奇•克蘭媽•奧斯汀•派克的比賽、是今天最重要的節目、事前許多人、帶預料着最後决賽的人、將是勃夸對克蘭姆、所以大家好像并不重視这一傷比賽、结果雖是勃奇以二—六、六—四、六—一的比數、击败派克、（克蘭姆勝奧斯丁比數為八—六、六—三、十二—十四、六—一、）但雙方戰來情形的緊張、卻遠出一般人想像之外、勃奇居然輪了一盤、這在他、一九三七年還是第一次、而派克也是第一個人、派克今天打得太妙了、他是名符其實的美國第二名手、一位英國記者看了這一塲比賽以後嘆氣、“十年以內英國都不會有重獲台杯的希望、”（勃奇與派克兩人今年都只二十一歲、）第二天每日先驅報記者說、“兩年以內派克得不到世界錦標、吾頭叮斷”、總之、這是今年惠勃列登最精彩的一塲比賽、今年度美國獲勝台杯、起碼有七八成把握、</p>
<p>▲勃奇擊敗派克</p>
<p>看過勃奇擊球的人、時常總有一種感覺、無論對方球藝如何凶猛、但他始終總有把握、始終總佔上風、他平時同普通一二流名手比賽時、幾乎老是一種“貓玩老鼠”的態度、可是他今天着急了、這是第一次、我們看到勃奇顯出慌亂的樣子、連換了好幾次球拍、</p>
<p>第一盤開賽後、勃奇還是他慣用的一種不慌不忙的態度、等到派克四—二估先時、他才感到情形不對、可是已經太遲了、勃奇最銳利的武器、砲彈式的發球、不但被派克接分住、甚致於他“蓋世無雙”的攔網技術、球一到對方陣地時、也時被派克救起、這結果就近得勃奇束手無策、派克以六—二勝了第一盤、</p>
<p>第二盤勃奇開琉笑的熊度消失了、雖然派克扔運勝兩局、比數為二—○、至此、勃奇使出他的全身本領、也連下兩局、但是派克并不輕易屈服的、輪到勃奇發練、他居然又勝了這一局、成為三—二的比數、再輪到派克發球、又以巧妙的方法、輕取這一局、比數為四—二、這時候、全塲的觀衆都在替派克助威大家想、也許意外的事情會發生了、假如派克能夠連勝勃奇兩盤、誰敢擔保勃奇不會再輸第三盤、倘若眞的這樣的時候、那也許要成為惠勃列登史上第一件奇事、然而勃奇究是竟是藝高膽大、而同時這也是派克的全盛時代、此後勃奇即恢復常態、經過雙方劇烈的競爭以後、勃奇連下四局、勝了第二盤、</p>
<p>第三盤時、勃奇又先以二—三的比數落後、他今天仍露出他的老毛病、正手抽球屢次不能過網、但他的反手抽球、卻是道地的貨色、經過幾度你來我往以後、終於以五—四的比數佔先、這時候派克的大勢已去、勃奇勝了第十局、比數為六—四、贏了第三盤、</p>
<p>第四盤時、派克已露出倦容、勃奇卻愈戰愈勇、這時候、勃奇才是眞正的勃奇、他的攔網妙技、派克再也沒有抵抗的能力、結果勃奇又以六—一獲勝、</p>
<p>▲克拉姆騰奧斯汀</p>
<p>正同這一塲相反的、就是克蘭姆與奧斯丁的比賽、由於比數上看來、好像也十分緊張、其實是一宗沈悶的事情、第一盤時雙方稍有競爭、克蘭姆以八—六獲勝、第二盤更成一面倒的狀况、克蘭姆勝來并不覺得吃力、只第三盤有一塲劇戰、但同時也愈顯出沈悶、克蘭姆會以五—三佔先、奧斯丁在無可奈何的狀態下、作困戰鬥、因為他是英國的第一名手、在英國觀衆面前、以直落三盤失敗、似乎太說不過去了、於是比數由五—五、一直戰到十二—十二、克蘭姆好像也看出奧斯丁的目的、只在求擭勝一盤、并沒有其他奢望、於是很有點隨便的樣子、讓奧斯丁連勝兩局、比數為十四—十二、這一盤一共花了四十分鐘時問、第二天一家英國報紙說、這是一盤“馬拉松”的網球戰、</p>
<p>第四盤克蘭姆勝來、幾乎就沒有費力過、幾分鐘時間以後、他早以六—一的比數擭勝、并沒有出一般的預料、今年度最後决賽的兩人、是勃奇與克籣姆、</p>
<p>男子雙打、女子雙打并混合雙打、大部分都已達到第四週賽的階段、除男子雙打澳洲名手克勞福特—麥克格拉綏、這一對早受淘汰以外、共餘的“主將”、都平安渡過、女子雙打“主將”史波苓夫人—葉可步士女士、這一對今天被擊敗、論對方的實力、不過是一對普通的選手、全傷觀衆無不同情這兩位的遭遇、混合雙打淘汰的結果、當以美國勃奇—馬蒲耳女士、并法國彼得拉—馬秀夫人、這兩對實力最強、目前錦標呼聲似乎以美國的一對較高、</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>華紗高過外紗十餘元標紗繼漲增高</p>
<p>紗市續趨翱翔、蓋以空氣良好、證券上漲、現紗銷路益覺起色、外埠紗價亦見提升、蜀帮納胃甚强、倉庫存紗日見减縮、致人心堅固、不過現紗市價、已達高境、二十支紗信價竟在二百八十二三元之譜、比外紗高過十餘元矣、且各方接連採辦、爲額殊夥、興奮性稍形冷澹也、</p>
<p>近遠再漲二元左右</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月繼續上升、人心活潑、同時現紗生意尚稱不惡、買氣尤盛、本月狂漲三元六角、遠漲一元一•四角、二盤以後聞公債亦復漲、市象愈見穩定、但有一部份以寇患益深、無心投機、故交易殊覺沉寂、迨至收盤時復見軟弱、回小幾角、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一元一角至二元半、查賣出同興二百包、益記二百包、源大二百包、合興二百五十包、瑞大九百五十包、申大三百五十包、愼記三百五十包、顧大三百五十包、生源六百五十包、同和二百包、信誠六百包、買進大孚六百五十包、澄記三百包、大豐一千包、泰興三百五十包、興昌五百包、仁豐三百五十包、澗康九百包、新華一千一百五十包、茲將半日間最高低價列左、</p>

<p>現紗昨是各帮買去統計一千三百三十五包、售價漲一•二元不等、各帮買額列下、</p>
<p>棉花欲漲反跌</p>
<p>棉市始漲繼回、趨勢依然平常、陳棉因現棉廠需不辦、至於新棉國內生產狀况、目前受天時睛正之意、可獲美滿、國外美棉一味下游、故紗市雖步步提高、棉市反呈背道而馳也、</p>
<p>八月陳花又跌六角</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因多數心理認爲環境轉佳紗市再漲、空頭紛起抵補、市盤乃續向前進、八月漲五角、但拍至遠期新花益覺疲無動、但入後聞美棉印棉俱見調敞、市况復入疲途、八月陳花跌風又起、新棉產入漩渦中、標花結果八月比上日收盤價跌六角、餘跌一角半、惟十二月漲五分、查賣出同興一千一百担、大豐一千担、源大一千担、森康一千一百担、同豐八百担、福康七百担、同和七百担、愼昌七百担、瑞大七百担、買進大孚三千九百担、元一一千七百担、經華一千担、信诚三千三百担、益康八百担、新興八百担、茲將半日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>棉花日廠辦胃獨健</p>
<p>現棉消費、日廠漸形活動採辦、惟華商絕無問津之念、實緣最近以來、棉紗現銷不弱、本埠期棉亦轉安定人心穩固、故日商購辦新花一千件、共計成交二千餘件、碼頭到貨姚花八十四包、</p>

<p>天氣報告順利美英印棉一味下游</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、天氣良好、南方棉收順利、尤以織克塞斯爲最、同時缺乏買進之刺激、各月跌二至四磅音、初以本地帮買進、有回好現象、惜買方繼起無人、同業限價買進不多、而外商及紐奧崙又起拋售、市價再疲、天氣預測、東部良好、中部有雲雨、西部除奧克拉霍馬外、一部有雲、收盤時、空戶抵補、市勢轉緊、計現貨跌三磅音期貨由不動至跌五磅音、英棉現貨跌三點、期貨跌四五點、印棉初因歐洲出口商買進及空戶抵補而漲、後因中央省一部份獲得益雨而回、計平果爾漲○•七五羅比、奧姆辣跌二羅比、白羅溪跌○•七五至一羅比、原電錄左、（二十二日電）</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>本廠棉布活動力加强</p>
<p>昨日布市、白貨趨勢頗佳、東疋細布高檔龍頭五福等牌、現貨缺乏、而染廠以長江中上游藍布需要續增、因之吸牧甚力、紗市逐步回昂、人心鞏固、市價每疋又漲起五分、全日成交五六百件、洋行方面開出近期喇叭童細布、細斜一百數十件、東疋百貨客路生意一致衰退、而本廠布疋活動力加强粵帮續添滬常各廠細斜粗布四百餘件、細布一百餘件、長沙帮辦細布、細斜六七十件、江西帮辦貨客人已離滬、新貨緩進、購定各貨刻正逐日趕裝、川帮催裝定貨色布綫呢甚盛、承定各廠均趕速交貨、本街內地批發以緊縮放賬、市面益爲呆頓、門莊生意更形闌珊、</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>湘省有禁運出口之說　客秈激漲二角許</p>
<p>昨客秈南北實銷均活、南洋除汕頭外、復有厦門暢辦、北洋亦有機靖去化、糙米邇日到頭不旺、而本街內地仍濃、目傳湘省當地亦有封禁出口之舉、因此本外埠人心一致向上、產地亦多來電緩售、市價立即跳漲角外至二角許不等、全日開出贛米七千五百六十六包、湘米四千九百二十包、沙漢糙米八百五十包、洋麥產訊雖見報低、然以販運不劃、未有續定、</p>
<p>白粳薄稻削價求售</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源近三十號、貨共六千二三百石、本街銷塲自前午轉懈後、昨則更見呆滯所以市况轉疲、幸到貨不多、結果若厚早粳價略貶幾分至角許薄稻降一角、杜洋尖帶疲、陰變元平庸、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來閘船戶稍有、約二十餘號、晨刻開盤、各貨交易寂寞異常、致價回跌一二角、後因殺價過小、引起店方略有拾取特別白粳價回小角許、中下者價小二角左右、薄稻貨稀、店胃尚可、價挺立、羊杜尖疲勢、白元定立、共他各貨亦疲欶、</p>
<p>新黃荳提高殺次</p>
<p>▲豆餅銷塲依然活潑</p>
<p>昨日新黃豆市况、互呈軒輊、原因到銷不均、勢趨提高殺次之局、市開城門豆二百餘包、行情在到少高缺之情形下、提升角譜、江橋豆成交三百包、行情跌三四分、三陽豆成二百包、跌八九分、第一次上市之都昌豆做開二百八十餘包、次爲六元零五分至五元九角、山本街廣帮分去、豆餅去路仍頗活躍、成妥期現各餅二萬二千餘片、行情續漲一分、故陳豆市氣賴以穩定、榨油廠辦胃亦動、昨純市做開各豆四市五百餘包云、</p>
<p>粉麥仍無新交易</p>
<p>昨日紛麥市面、全日仍祇了結交易、新交易一無發展、良以事實困難、沉寂更甚也、至麺粉禁止出口一節、已定有辦法、凡無資敵之嫌者、由市商會及同業公會之證明、國內已有通融、如果長此硬擯、不但社會經濟發生影響、勞工階級、亦將有無工可作之感、小麥情形、因麺粉不久可以流通、行販與廠家、已有集議、惟廠方欲擯小一點、行販則欲提高意見未能接近、致無成交、大約下週起或可一新眉目公、</p>
<h3>油市</h3>
<p>桐油到稀梢見轉機　國內存貨仍甚豐厚</p>
<p>白桐油市面自入夏以來、一蹶不振、洋莊去路、素恃美國爲大宗、現聞美國存底有三萬噸以上、以每月五六千噸需用計之亦可供五六個月所需、故近一二月來、我國出口、未見踴躍、漢市最低、每擔價僅四十五六元連稅、近日因來源稀少、略轉俏勢、據昨晚漢電已漲至五十元零三四角、但查各產地存積、均屬雄厚、故雖一時俏俐、恐仍難持久、蓋距產新雖尚有三四月之遙、然全國所存據詳細調查、尚有六十萬擔、較之往年、相去實不可以道里計也、故此後市面、或當長疲短俏、本埠素仰浙桐爲挹注、自最近滬杭路貨車停駛後、滬上到貨頓告斷絕、市塲上頗形缺俏、現已設法由水道舟運、始稍稍有到、惟運輸時間延長及運費加高、故每砠須在五十元左右也、</p>
<h3>南北貨</h3>
<p>新杏仁粵銷最活</p>

<h3>禁書詩話</h3>
<p>— 蕪村</p>
<p>廿六年七月廿二日，報載蘆溝橋事件談判告成，我方遵約撤兵，日方增運軍火，“和平”有望，而舉國同悲。</p>
<p>廿三日申報載天津專電：</p>
<p>津郵局自十八日起為日軍派人駐局檢査信件，該局曾分別報告中央及地方當局。市警局長李文田迭次與日軍部交涉後，已得橋本藤井諒解，二十二日下午四時，駐郵局檢査之日人，已奉令撤回，不再檢査。同日新聞報，又載北平電：</p>
<p>綏署頃査禁市內各書店經售大批刋物，計有華北呼聲，東北智識，抗日戰綫，抗日將軍，抗敵生活，國際知識，民衆之路，救國文選，讀書生活，中國人，中國呼聲，三民月刋，桂林月刋‥‥等六十餘種，已令警局禁止發售。</p>
<p>“投我以木桃，報之以瓊瑤”，你們卽然准予停止檢査郵件，屍承“諒解”；我們自當嚴行禁售刋物，以示“親善”。你不査，我來禁，“匪報也，永以為好也”，我們原是同文同種，十分親愛的“東亞兩大民族”呀！</p>
<p>如此盛事，安得不記！—詩云：</p>
<p>蘆溝橋畔血痕殷，文化城中笑語頻，誰說開門為揖盜，將軍酷愛是和平。</p>
<p>綏署呈皇禁令申，無辜書報苦沉淪，滿城風雨文字刦，一片投桃報李心。</p>
<p>莫道神州大陸沈，中華國土廉無倫。祇憐無定河邊月，千古長明壯士魂！</p>
<h3>莫談國事</h3>
<p>— 家千</p>
<p>有一個時候，公共塲所都有“莫談國事”的禁例，其理由不詳，而且也呌人猜不透！或許就是新詞人所謂“國家事管牠娘，打打麻將”•但是“國家事”，眞能”管牠娘”嗎？則又未必盡然。卽是“中國是怎樣的令人感到失望，是怎樣的令人有話不敢說”，（見曾今可“答一個靑年的來信”）然以一個公民的資格“談”到“國事”，無論是有理由或沒有理由，總不致是認為犯罪吧？然而因爲“國家事旣不能管，就只好不管，”於是把“沉痛寄托在這句話裏，（卽“打打痲將”）來發洩當時的苦悶”（答一個靑年的來信）來作為“莫談國事”的理由，竊以為不妥矣。</p>
<p>處此暴風雨前夕的靑年，誰都感到徬徨，苦悶，但新詞人在當時，也聽見有人喊着各種各樣的口號，口號果眞未必能實踐，而從這些口號中看到許多靑年在徬徨，苦悶中找出路是可以的。政府對於“開放言論”也有過明確的表示，那末，中國在令人感到失望之餘，總不致令人有話不敢說啊！</p>
<p>且看此次蘆溝橋事件發生之後，羣情激昂，“國事”大家可“談”，如果因為苦悶，拉四個人來凑滿一桌，“打打麻將”，恐怕在一片白板，中風聲中尚不知“今日之冀察，將成為昔日之東四省”也。</p>
<p>“莫談國事”的見解是錯誤的，更不必用什麼恐怕不法份子乘機搗亂等藉口，每一個公民有“談談國事”的權利，而且正因為我們要“談談國事”，引起認為“我為魚肉”的工部局干涉了。昨日立報載：“昨晚（二十二日）十一時，外灘公園草地上有靑年多人，因關心時局，聚坐會談，但人數越聚越多，巡捕見後，卽驅逐他們出園，諸靑年以談談時局，是常有的事，况而並無違法行為，故仍留園中。巡捕見狀，卽通知捕房，來捕</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>多人，結果有四靑年被補去，旋卽釋放云。</p>
<p>“租界當局已忘記其本身所佔地位係租界，而全以殖民地對待吾輩”在上海市文化界撤消租界戲曲電影檢査權運動會籌備會席上周劍雲說過這樣沉痛的話。租界當局當然不會忘記其本身所佔地位係租界，而全以殖民地對待吾輩者，正要我們自己去忘記那是租界，因之電影上不凖有東四省的地圖，在公園內唱救忘歌曲而“行裏去”，“關心時局，聚坐會談”，在那輩“食君祿，報皇恩的巡捕目中，自然又該坐牢。</p>
<p>從前租界上的公園是“犬與華人不得入內”的，現在總算納了一元人頭稅得以自由出入了；但是“到了租界上，你得忘了是中國入”！綠藤影裏，漢水池邊，最好儷影雙雙，喁喁情話，那末，卽使“越聚越多”，他們也會倒拖了警棍，悄悄地避去。如果要唱救亡歌曲，談談時局，這與“全以殖民地對待我輩”勢必發生衝突，因為其本身所佔地位終究還是“租界”。</p>
<p>人家正希望我們“莫談國事”—這大概與“愚民政策”想去不遠，中國卽是怎樣的令人感到失望，但是做老百姓的“就只好不管”嗎？</p>
<p>我們要“談談國事”，二十三晨一時本報北平急電：中日次定二十一晨雙方撤兵後，蘆溝橋五里店大井村之日軍，本應同時撤退，但截至二十二日晚六時止，日軍毫無撤退模樣，並增加大小鋼砲二十餘門，蘆溝橋以東一帶，亦運到大批毒瓦斯，…這“次定”是誰允許他們“决定”的？</p>

<h3>德國栢林台格耳包捷克廠之百年史</h3>
<p>一九三七年七月二十二日為栢林台格耳最著名之包捷克廠百年紀念。在德國栢林舉行盛大慶祝，茲將包捷克廠創辦人及其後嗣對於該廠之創辦歷史，列錄於後：</p>
<p>該廠為沃搿四脫包捷克君所創設，彼於一八○四年生於德國白萊司老，在該處先習木工，後遇機會乃至翻砂及機器廠服務。因動於工作，未幾卽升為經理。其時彼尚壯年，對此環境，並未感到滿足，乃集所有積蓄，於一八三六年十二月創設小規模機器工廠於栢林。第一批承製為螺絲一一六○○○只，當時僱工五十名工作。至一八三七年中，乃有一比較完備之機器廠成立，當時所需之原動力，祇藉兩匹馬所推動，爐子則用風箱。至一八三七年之七月二十二日，其第一次生鐵鑄出，而此日卽由沃搿四脫包捷克指定為該廠成立紀念日。</p>
<p>一八三八年春，該廠所製第一座蒸汽機完成，此後製造方法逐漸改良，復有織布機，製糖機等出品，再進而蒸汽機，蒸汽鍋爐汲水機等亦開始製造。</p>
<p>一八四一年第一輛火車機頭製成，自後絡續接到大批火車機頭使該廠營業蒸蒸日上。沃搿四股包捷克鏖於火車機頭，將有極大需要，乃從事改良，精益求精，未幾此項出品卽成為世界最著名者矣。後以供不應求，乃擴充為大規模之製造廠。</p>
<p>一八四七年復有鋼鐵，鐵板等出品，至此沃搿四脫包捷克始得遂其不求外貨之初志。一年後，又購得機器廠一所，該廠開工時包捷克欲使其事業有更大之發展，力謀獨立，故租用雪利先上游之煤礦生鐵礦以自給，不幸適於此時彼竟棄其所有而長逝人時為一八五四年也</p>
<p>愛耳勃為沃搿四脫包捷克之子，其時彼年二十五歲，卽繼其先人遺志，從事經營，後復有輸船機器，鐵路材料及船壳等出品。他一八七○至一八七一年之戰時，承製地雷，魚雷，砲架等軍用器械。至於製造火車機頭，此時已成為世界聞名之榮譽出品。</p>
<p>一八七八年愛耳勃包捷克逝世，其時栢林工廠及雪利先之工作人員已兩倍於其父逝世之時。因其生子及後嗣矮納耳，歐納司脫，卡耳，年事尚幼，其父愛耳勃授權與董事會，奈該董事等怯於負責，以至廠中出品略有減色。</p>
<p>至一八九四年，此昆仲三人，相繼長成，乃起而負責，長兄矮納耳，主持雪利先上游之礦務，惜於一八九七年墜於礦井慘死。</p>
<p>歐納司脫及卡耳鑒於舊式機件之不甚適用，故決創設新廠於台格耳，此廠籌備於一八九六年，至一八九八年始行製造出品，廠中一切設備，極為精良週到，出品更其完備，如造冷機，空氣煤氣壓榨機，馬姆式抽水機等，未幾又有化學工廠之一切器械及榨油機伴均全。</p>
<p>當一九一四年至－九一八年歐戰開始，該廠卽專造軍器。戰後復努力經營，乃有蒸汽透平榨油機等出品，奈戰後各國原氣未復，銷路停滯，本國鐵路管理局又無力購買新車，該廠乃稍受影響</p>
<p>至一九三○年止包捷廠出品之火車機頭已有一二○○○輛，至一九三三年乃與萊彌達廠合併，此後營業復興，各國定貨擁擠，工作人員日有增加，乃於上海江西路漢密登大廈七○四號設立萊彌達包捷克機器廠駐華工程事務所矣。</p>

<h3>集郵鎖談</h3>
<p>— 陳劍霞</p>
<p>“天下之物以少爲貴，”這句話眞是顚撲不破的格言，一般骨董家，對於希有的古物，如夏鼎，商葬，晋帖，康碑，視同拱壁，價値連城，便是這個原則。</p>
<p>郵票這樣東西，用過之後，似乎已成廢物，但是世間竟有不少舊郵，大家認爲無價之寶，爭相羅致，豈不是匪夷所思麽？</p>
<p>郵票的歷史，在歐洲各國，已很悠久，所以集郵家也特別的多。他們研究郵票的興趣，遠過於其他古玩，有專做郵票買賣的郵商，有組織流通郵票的距大公司，也有討究時代，形式，貴，賤，與辨別眞僞的郵票專籍，對於一切舊郵，幾與普通貨品，一樣看待。每種郵票。都有一定的標凖價格，有時還舉行舊郵展覧，及當塲拍賣等情事，因供求趨勢之不同，更有行情升降之變遷，故詐多集郵家的目的，不僅是愛好珍奇，並視作一種可以企圖獲利的儲蓄。</p>
<p>我國之有郵政，始於前淸光緒年間，距今不過四十年的歷史，但已有很多名貴的舊郵，膾炙人口，最初通行的郵票，僅用一張方塊的紅紙，蓋上一個有字的木戳，便算發生效川。紙質卽劣，字跡又不甚明顯，今雖尙有遺留，價値並不甚貴。大概因這種舊郵，容易發生膺鼎，故不爲一般集郵家所重視，我國郵票中，最認爲珍貴者，是一種蓋有小字當作壹圓的紅印花，此項郵票，當時爲紀念慈禧太后萬壽，暫用印花票加蓋發行，繼因字小作廢，改用大字，以此蓋有小字的，僅寥寥幾個，到了現在，每個達一千五百元以上的價格。此外還有大字壹圓龍門倒蓋等畸形變體，都是國郵中高價的珍品。</p>
<p>總之，凡屬特別而少見的郵票，便可作爲集郵家的奇貨。記得八九年前，初次發行航空郵票，當京滬航綫通郵的頭三天，郵局爲舉行紀念起見，試用紅色戳印，一般集郵家，發狂似的購票寄信，甚將一封空信，貼滿各種價格的航空郵票，以求得一個紅印爲可喜。筆者有位朋友，在此一役，化去共約三百元之譜，結果得到許多花花綠綠的舊票信封，不知者一定笑他瘋狂，豈知不到多久，便有一個江西來的集郵家，出了八十元的代價，換得一個信封，兩人的交涉，還互相認爲十分情而呢！</p>
<p>國內最有名的集郵家，首推周今覺氏，個中人稱之爲郵票大王。聽說池，所有的郵票，値價不下二三十萬，上述的小壹圓紅花，他竟有四個聯在一起的，在國郵當中．實可算得希世之珍，中外集郵家，沒有不引爲艶羨的，從前洪憲世子袁寒雲氏，也是一集郵專家，不過後來因爲經濟關係，曾有將全部郵集讓渡之消息，不知此項郵票，現在流落何處了。</p>
<p>至於集郵的方法，第一個條件，當然脫不了金錢，如有充分的經濟，便可隨意選購心好的精品，歸納成集，立刻可以洋洋大觀。其次不論新舊郵票，在能力範圍以內，都可設法收集，最好友人中在公司或機關担任收發，更易託爲張羅，如此日積月累必可得到各種不同之式樣，然後再設法與人交換，以有易無，這樣要成一部郵集，亦非不可能的事。</p>
<p>郵集卽有可觀，於是要求形式的講究，郵冊必須精裝，每個郵票，應用透明的玻璃紙包圍，可以永久保存他的色澤，黏貼的手續，也不可草率，應用製就的膠紙，方可隨意改變地位。這樣的郵集，無論他的價値如何，一定非常富麗堂皇。意興所至，出面玩賞，其樂趣也不减於古書名畫。那麽隨時收集，隨時珍藏匿，卽可養成恒久的習慣，更能提高欣賞的情緒，尤其於估値方面，可以集零爲整，不但無損毫末，或者還有相當的利益，豈非一舉而數得嗎？</p>
<h3>避暑勝地靑島之水族館風景</h3>
<p>— 張啟昌壠</p>
<h3>足聲舞基本步法運用</h3>
<p>— 鄭里奧</p>
<p>五連音步法之一——四斷音有一個印象，記得幼時在某地，看過幾次從上海來的歌舞團體，正是黎派歌樂盛行的時期，曾看見的所謂蹕躂舞，踝踕本是聲音的象徵詞，但她們多穿着膠底布帆鞋，反而一個場音都聽不見，兩面擺的機械式跳看，到今日這種還似乎還未絕跡，可知濫用外國藝術，未免貽笑於人，如今自然歸功於好萊塢舞法的影響和推動力，中國才有奠定足聲舞的基礎，但是藝術無國界的，是人類的自然的進化。</p>
<p>此種舞藝在香港，澳門等地稱爲鐵底舞，在南洋星洲安南等稱爲急足舞，今年无日我在首都表演時，他們定做足音舞，現在通常多仍沿用過去的名詞踢躂或躂躂舞，似乎不類英文TAP，DANCE的音譯，我以爲顧名思義，還是足跳出聲音，用足聲舞三字定名極爲吻合，或足音舞，且對於英文的意思譯出更適宜。</p>
<p>現在說到四斷音，因爲它的足音需要更顯明的，它的本位步法是，㊀左足舉起向前用足蹠落地發出第一個音，㊁隨着足跟落地發出第二個音，身體略卽沉低，㊂右足舉起向前用足尖落地發出第三個音，同時左足足距離地，身體移前，㊃用左足跟落地發出第四個音，同時右足又舉起，身體略卽沉低，跳下去，可繼續用右足進行，步法同上，以上共四音時間各估一拍。</p>
<p>五連音起步，四斷音四拍子共七個音，—根據四斷音步法和拍子的，沒有三節音的難跳卽先用左足踢出五連音，係㊀㊁之代表音，其中三連音佔一拍，尙餘兩音佔一拍，身體略卽沉低，餘㊂㊃同上兩拍，連前共四拍，—四節音步位圖：</p>
<h3>介紹一位新進小票友</h3>
<p>— 若</p>
<p>小票友爲海上聞人胡方銘先生之第三公子國榮世兄，年僅九齡，英武之氣，現於眉宇對于武劇尤若夙素擅習，往者，愚嘗詣其尊翁所辦之時代票房，見其手弄槍棒口誦鑼鼓，馳逐衆賓之間，一舉一動靡不中節，心竊異其非凡品也，客歲春間，票房殊感缺乏武生人材，乃慫恿其尊翁爲習白水灘一齣，不數月藝乃大晋，厥後於其尊翁五十大慶堂會中．觀其上演此劇則丰脚簡練，槍棒純熟，駸駸乎非僅登堂而且入室矣，至於台風亮相一小動作之間凡武戲應具之藝之美，可稱靡不畢具，聞其尊翁言斯劇上台。茲爲第二次現已學得者更有八蜡廟，獅子樓等，繁重之劇，誠票界後起之傑出之人材也，下圖卽其白水灘飾穆于畿之劇照。</p>
<h3>夏夜的兆豐花園</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>傍晚，那夏日的夕陽，照射着兩條不整齊的影子，一搖一幌地向着極司非而路走去，馬路上的塵砂和汽車屁，幾乎把我們窒息得透不過氣來，直到望見了兆豐花園的門口，纔松了一口氣，於是那顆沉悶的心，也感到了一種快慰和輕舒。</p>
<p>走進了園裏，我們覺得好像已投進了另一個世界，夾道，這蒼罩蔥蘢的樹林，和那軟綠如茵的淺草，櫬托出了整個大自然的活潑，美麗，使我們竟忘記了自己還置身在煩囂的都市中，而把那生活的苦惱也暫時摔到了腦後，一個幽美的夢境，便很活躍地在我們眼前幻出了。</p>
<p>沿著一條幽徑，向前面綠蔭處走去，草地上，叢林裹，已經點綴着許多靑年男女，這時候，殘陽雖已在山，但那朶金黃色的餘輝，却還要接着晚霞的紅光，探出腦袋來，向這灰黯的大地，作一次最後的窺望，彷彿有點依戀的神情。</p>
<p>太陽難然躲進了地平綫，可是天時還很早，因此園中的人還不怎樣多；隨後，天色漸漸地黯淡了，於是那些遊園人也陸續陸續地在園裹多了起來，而且那許多椅子上也估滿了人。</p>
<p>黑夜的序幕，已經很迅速地推進了大自然裹，河畔的小草上也爬着了夏夜的涼風‘那可愛的月姊却靜靜地躱在樹梢頭微笑，吐出了柔媚的光芒，像水銀般地瀉在地上，堆在樹梢，淌在水面，媚看着不禁興奮地讀嘆了起來。</p>
<p>—這美麗的世界呵，這幽秘之夜呵，夜夜神啊，你永恒地留在人間吧！</p>
<p>我從椅子上走了下來，仰臥在河邊的草地上，在望着白雲的浮遊，看着疎星的閃耀出神，這時媚也坐在我身邊革地上，但是她只是默默地坐着，沒有一句話語，好像在領略這幽美的夜趣。</p>
<p>河畔的垂揚，輕輕地拂拭着水面，微風過處，這靜止的河水便流出了銀光似的碎波，幾道燈光恰如電鞭似地映在河底動盡，一個紅衣的女郎引着一羣活潑的孩子，將三五隻小帆船在河面上放送，船兒行遠了，祇見它隱約地隨着風兒在搖幌，那時我們彷彿在海濱上望着海面上的點點帆影，在向着悠然的烟波裹消逝一樣，忽然，一羣鴨子地呌着游了過去，震得河面上的小帆船全搖撼不定起來，那周遭，却充滿了一片天眞無邪的嬉笑聲。</p>
<p>在月影底下，燈先暗處，並肩坐着一對對的人兒，他們在談一些濃情蜜愛，綠草原上，幢幢的人影，像天空的繁星似的散佈着、隔河的茅亭裹那爵士的歌樂，也跟着人們的心弦一樣，奏出了那輕快的調子。</p>
<p>一陣鏗鏘的“披露娜聲，徐徐地從園外那座小洋房裹溜進來，夾着一種哀抑的歌聲，我抬頭向那面望望，只見在園的一角有一叢濃蔭密茂的樹林，樹林裹面隱約地聳起着那精緻的屋頂，窗口裹有一縷幽澹的電燈光射出來，反映在樹葉上，使上面的月光失去了嫵媚的情調，而增加了一層慘愁的色彩，那琴聲和歌聲便是由這窗口裏出來的。</p>
<p>不整齊的步伐，踏出了節奏的音調，路邊的夏蟲在嘶聲地鳴呌，池畔的蛙鼓，枝頭的蟬琴，交奏着夏夜的交響樂，人是有說有笑地，有的在高談闊論，有的在低聲唱歌，有的在吹奏着口琴，這一切的擾聲，敲破了深夜的沉靜。</p>
<p>我們在荷池邊上徘徊着，那池裹的大靑蛙，本來是很起勁的呌着，但也許聽到了我們的脚步聲，所以當我們走近一墩蒲草邊時，牠們便戛然地停止了，而一池翠蓋婷婷的荷葉却在輕輕地擺動着，幾株含苞的荷花似乎在向着我們點頭，那種輕盈苗條的姿態，在月光底下更其顯得美麗可愛了。</p>
<p>“夜深”，回去吧！終於，我們走出了花園的門，帶着一顆輕快的心，踏上了歸途。</p>
<p>“再會吧，夏夜的兆豐花園呵”！當我跨上了那輛雙層公共汽車，還探首窗外，向它輕輕地道了一聲別，似乎還懷着無限的依變與惆悵呢？</p>

<h3>The Situation in Beiping and Tianjin is Worrying, Japanese Troops on the Front Lines Continue to Increase</h3>
<p>Kawagoe has no preparation to come to Beijing for negotiations. Japan’s intentions are unfathomable, it is rumored there are other plans. Kashii's illness worsens, Hashimoto acts in his place.</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The situation in Beiping and Tianjin is extremely worrying. After Feng Zhi’an’s troops retreated, although there has been no fighting on the front lines, the Japanese side has delayed withdrawing its troops, and their intentions are unfathomable. Military staff are running around and active, with other new plans. The overall situation will develop within a few days. (This newspaper’s urgent telegram at 2:10 AM on the 24th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Kashii is currently seriously ill and unable to get out of bed. The affairs of the Japanese military in Tianjin are being handled by Chief of Staff Hashimoto. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Evening News reports reliable information that regarding the issue of ceasefire and troop withdrawal between China and Japan, as of noon on the 23rd, the telegrams received in Beijing only mention the withdrawal of a small portion of troops. However, the extent to which negotiations should determine the withdrawal, and the boundaries of the area, have not been reported in detail by Song Zheyuan. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Song Zheyuan handles political affairs. He arrived at the political affairs committee to work at 7:00 AM this morning. (Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] After half a month of negotiations over the Lugouqiao Incident, the military conflict has come to an end as of the 22nd. If the Japanese army does not create further problems, the situation may temporarily ease. However, the Japanese troops on the front lines have not yet fully withdrawn. Whether the situation can be restored to the state before the 8th, and whether the Kwantung Army will return to outside the pass, is of great importance. Ambassador Kawagoe has consistently shown no preparation to return to Beijing for negotiations, and the future is not optimistic. However, according to news from the local authorities, if the Japanese army sincerely withdraws its troops, it is expected that the situation can be restored to the state before the 8th within a week. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The deployment of Japanese troops has not stopped at all. According to information from the road, five trains of Japanese soldiers are still stopped in Qinyu, and there are indications that they will continue to move west. On the morning of the 23rd, it was also heard that more than forty Japanese heavy-duty trucks loaded with a large amount of military supplies went to Fengtai. At 5:00 PM, forty-odd empty heavy-duty trucks returned to Tianjin. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Da Jing Village Opened Fire Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Beiping] At 5:00 AM this morning, Japanese troops in Dajing Village fired five shells at our army’s defense lines again. We have once again raised a question with them. Katō is going to Tianjin today to meet Kawagoe to report on the Lugouqiao case and ask for instructions on everything. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] According to those who fled from Dajing Village to Beiping for refuge, the Japanese troops have indeed withdrawn from the railway line, but only by a distance of about one or two li. The number of Japanese troops in the Dajing Village and Wulidian area has not decreased. The Japanese troops close to the railway line are under strict guard, with a machine gun post set up every fifty steps. All important road crossings leading to Beiping and Fengtai are guarded by Japanese troops, who conduct detailed interrogations of passersby. There is no sign of them withdrawing back to Fengtai in the short term. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Agreed-Upon Steps for Troop Withdrawal Between Both Sides</h3>
<p>[Beiping] When both sides decided to withdraw troops on the 20th, it was originally divided into three steps: ㊀ Our side withdraws troops from the Yamenkou and Babaoshan area; ㊁ The Japanese side withdraws troops from the Wulidian, Dajing Village, and Dawayao area; ㊂ Our side withdraws troops west of Lugouqiao, restoring the previous situation. Up to now, a large number of Japanese troops in the Dajing Village and Wulidian area have not withdrawn, and the Japanese army is withdrawing during the day and increasing at night, which is baffling. Negotiations are continuing with the Japanese side. (This newspaper's telephone report at 3:25 AM on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Lugouqiao Once Faced a Tense Situation</h3>
<p>[Beiping] In the Lugouqiao, Dajing Village, and Dawayao area, there are approximately two to three thousand Japanese troops. As of the afternoon of the 23rd, there was still no preparation for withdrawal. Moreover, several artillery units were added on the 22nd. That night, they went to the Shagang Heights southeast of the Lugouqiao Station, set up the artillery pieces, and aimed the muzzles at Wanping County, the Lugouqiao Stone Bridge, and Changxindian. After our side received the report, the security team in the city immediately went to the city walls to be on guard. At the same time, our troops in the Lugouqiao area were also prepared to move out. The reporter happened to enter the city for inspection at this time. Due to the severity of the situation, he left the city after a one-week inspection. By 8:00 PM, the situation had eased. As of the afternoon of the 23rd, there had been no conflict, and both sides were still in a stalemate. According to the agreement, the Japanese troops attacking the Wanping County and Lugouqiao area should have withdrawn on the 22nd, but as of the 23rd, they had not yet done so. Their repeated breaches of agreement have long been known to the world. It is expected that the future will still be difficult to be optimistic about. According to one of our military officers, in the battle at the Huilong Temple northeast of Lugouqiao, the enemy and we engaged in close combat several times. In the end, due to the power of our army's broadswords and the spirit of patriotism, dozens of enemy soldiers were killed. Therefore, the enemy army buried landmines to prevent our army from charging. At noon on the 23rd, there were rumors that a small portion of Japanese troops in Wulidian had withdrawn, but this has not been confirmed. According to Jin soldiers on the front lines, the Japanese army often declares withdrawal during the day, but then advances again at night. Therefore, a large-scale withdrawal is not credible. Wanping County and Lugouqiao are currently defended by our security team. Once the Japanese army withdraws according to the agreement, the 29th Army stationed in the area will also withdraw. There are no Japanese troops at the Lugouqiao Station, and everything is under the control of our personnel. The highlands about half a li southeast of the station are garrisoned by Japanese troops. When the reporter took the Pinghan train past the area at 2:00 PM on the 23rd, he saw the Japanese troops still in the trenches aiming at our troops about one li away, and they were still building trenches, with no sign of withdrawing. There are many bullet marks in front of Lugouqiao, which is now guarded by our soldiers. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Heavy Bombers Depart for China</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to information, Japanese military supplies are still being shipped to our country in a steady stream. Osaka recently detained seventeen merchant ships for military transport. In addition, fifty Japanese military aircraft, including a squadron of heavy bombers, departed from Japan yesterday for standby. The Japanese Air Force commander also flew along with the aircraft. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Baoding] At 12:00 noon on the 23rd, a Japanese reconnaissance plane reconnoitered at low altitude over the station for a long time before leaving. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Three Japanese aircraft reconnoitered back and forth in the Changxindian and Lugouqiao area on the morning of the 23rd for about an hour. Then, they flew over Beiping city and reconnoitered for a week before leaving. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Aircraft have been constantly flying and circling over Beiping city for several days. From 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM on the 23rd, several Japanese aircraft flew over Beiping city one after another, as well as Nanyuan, Beiyuan, Xiyuan, and Lugouqiao, conducting low-altitude reconnaissance in the suburbs. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] A Japanese plane circled over Beiping today for half an hour. At night, everything was quiet in the Wanping and Babaoshan positions. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] At 3:55 PM on the 23rd, another Japanese aircraft reconnoitered over Bian, then headed west. At 4:05 PM, it arrived over Zhengzhou, circled once, flew north, reconnoitered at high altitude over the Yellow River Railway Bridge, and then flew northeast. (Central News Agency telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Kawagoe Stays in Tianjin to Meet with Local Authorities</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] According to local officials here, the Chinese and Japanese troops at Lugouqiao have begun to withdraw, and the incident that occurred this time has come to an end. After the Lugouqiao Incident, a large number of Japanese troop trains came to Tianjin and transferred to Fengtai. Sources said that a total of 30 troop trains had arrived from outside the pass, with more than 7,000 personnel, more than 1,200 horses, and other items such as tanks, cars, and 30-40 airplanes. They are currently stationed in Tianjin, Fengtai, and other places, and there is no intention of withdrawing. Personnel from the Japanese military have unofficially indicated to officials that the mobilization of Japanese troops is complicated, and they will gradually withdraw after a short wait, but there is no date. Kawagoe is still in Tianjin. On the morning of the 23rd, Nagai, the Japanese consul stationed in Tianjin, visited Secretary-General Ma Yanchong of the municipal government, stating that the Lugouqiao case has been resolved and expressed his respect for the municipal government's maintenance of the local area in the past.

Japanese military supplies are currently being unloaded on the north bank of the Hai River, while Chinese soldiers are gathered on the south bank of the Hai River. The rumor that there was a conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops in Dagu is now known to be inaccurate. (Central News Agency Reuters telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Japan Increases Military Strength in Wanping and Lugouqiao</h3>
<p>[Beiping] The situation in North China is still worrying. Japanese troops increased their military strength in Wanping and Lugouqiao again on the afternoon of the 23rd. There is currently a company of Chinese troops in Babaoshan, and the Chinese troops in Yamenkou have been withdrawn.

<h3>Imai Expresses No Intention to Withdraw Troops</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Imai stated that whether the Japanese front-line army will completely withdraw will depend on whether the Chinese army has the sincerity to withdraw first before gradually withdrawing. The time is not yet right. After the front-line army withdraws to Fengtai, whether it will be stationed in Fengtai, transferred to other places, or transferred back to its home country will depend on the Chinese side. There has been no conflict near Lugouqiao recently. Whether the reinforcement units that the Japanese side has transferred into the pass after the Lugouqiao Incident will be demobilized or transferred back outside the pass will depend on the orders of the Ministry of the Army.

<h3>Japanese Aggression Against North China Was a Premeditated Scheme</h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that the current Lugouqiao Incident is not merely an attempt by Japan to resolve the issue of Chinese troops in Hebei Province. This can be known by looking back at past events. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has planned to gradually develop and deepen its influence towards the area beyond the Chinese Eastern Railway according to its agenda. For example, in November 1931, Japan earnestly declared that it would never cross the railway line and even claimed to have no relationship with Puyi. However, by the end of the month, it attacked Qiqihar. The following April, it established the "Manchukuo" and installed Puyi as its ruler. Later, it formally announced that it did not want to seize Jehol, but in the winter of that year, it annexed the province, as well as part of Hebei Province. The section of the Beining Railway line reaching Shanhaiguan was also included. Then it began to covet Chahar Province. In the summer of 1935, it took the opportunity to establish the "East Hebei Autonomous Government" and created a demilitarized zone. In the winter of 1936, it again sought to achieve its goals in Suiyuan by exploiting the rebellion of Mongolian troops. However, Chinese troops resisted bravely and were not successful. However, in September of that year, it occupied Fengtai on a pretext. As a result, the control of both the Beining and PingSui Railways fell entirely into the hands of the Japanese. On June 29th of this year, while Soviet and Japanese diplomatic representatives were discussing the division of land rights for islands in the Heilongjiang River, Lieutenant General Honma of the Japanese Army returned home from England, where he had attended the coronation of the British monarch. This lieutenant general was experienced, insightful, and highly respected by the Japanese. When asked about Soviet military vehicles, he replied that the Soviet army had been greatly shaken by Stalin's purges and was currently not worth paying attention to. Consequently, on July 1st, Japan adopted a tough stance on its demands regarding Heilongjiang, which, although resolved after mutual concessions, was actually unfavorable to the Soviet Union. In the first week of July, rumors of impending movements by Japanese troops in Beiping spread, causing considerable unrest. As expected, on July 7th, the current incident was triggered during Japanese military exercises near Lugouqiao. What Japan is most concerned about in the Chinese hinterland is securing the economic benefits it hopes to gain from occupying Manchuria. To solidify these benefits, it must be able to resist Soviet attacks. Although, as Lieutenant General Honma said, there is no need to fear this at present, it is difficult to guarantee that the Soviet Union will not become an enemy of Japan in the future. Therefore, it is now taking advantage of the Soviet Union's inability to focus on external affairs to make the left wing of the line from Heilongjiang to Suiyuan deeply rooted and flawless, so that it can concentrate on the economic issues it values most. This move will make "Manchukuo" and North China an economic unit. If "Manchukuo" does not have direct trade relations with North China, it will not be able to obtain the benefits of occupying the area. Hebei and its northern regions have abundant natural resources. Japan intends that once it can control these resources, not only can the economic success of occupying Manchuria be achieved, but also the economic needs of the home country can be guaranteed. Therefore, the opportunity that Japan has gained today to amass a large army in North China seems to have been created with careful consideration, in order to take the opportunity to carve out another large corner of important Chinese territory. To say that this incident was not premeditated is truly burying one's head in the sand. Japan's foreign policy has once again been overcome by the ambitions of the military, and a tragic drama may begin again.</p>
<p>A Harbin dispatch from the *North-China Daily News* on July 15th reports that although there is little information about the North China Incident here, Japanese troops are very busy transporting supplies on the railway lines and in the Songhua River. Transports pass through here continuously, heading for North China or the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan. Many bombers stationed near the Russian border in recent months have also been moved. The Japanese currently do not seem to fear a Soviet invasion. Locals are therefore puzzled by the Japanese attack on Soviet gunboats in the Heilongjiang River several weeks ago, which was likely intended to test whether the Soviet Union would take a tough course of action or simply end the matter with a protest. The number of Japanese soldiers killed or wounded in the attack is unknown. It is reported that at the funeral of the two Russian soldiers killed in Hailanpao, speakers vowed to avenge this humiliation.</p>

<h3>The Illusion of Peace</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In recent days, due to the retreat of our troops from Lugouqiao, the situation in North China on the surface seems to have gradually eased from tension to peace. As a result, some people feel that the most serious stage of the situation has passed, and we have avoided war and achieved peace. This psychology of hoping for peace through luck is reflected in the trend of the public bond market and the current neglect of the situation in Peiping and Tianjin. In reality, such an illusion of peace is a major crisis in our movement to resist the enemy and save the nation.</p>
<p>We should point out that when the initial conflict broke out at Lugouqiao, our brave 29th Army defended our territory and fought to the death, inspiring the entire nation to respond in unison, we were grasping the most favorable and optimistic conditions for resisting the enemy and saving the nation. However, after enduring the enemy's repeated insincere ceasefires, mobilizing large reinforcements from outside the passes and from their own country, and then treacherously bombing the suburbs of Beiping and Wanping, while at the same time coercing the Hebei-Chahar authorities to hold negotiations in Tianjin and accept humiliating conditions, these humiliating conditions are now being implemented one by one. At this time, although we see a superficially easing atmosphere in Beiping and Tianjin, in reality it is precisely indicating that another great shame and humiliation for our nation has been created. And in the near future, the extremely dangerous situation in North China will unfold even more rapidly.</p>
<p>We only need to consider: The 100,000 Japanese troops have already concentrated in Hebei. Will they quickly retreat? The Tianjin postal authority has been interfered with. The Tanggu pier has been occupied. The entire Beining Railway has been seized. What kind of situation will Hebei become? Furthermore, the loyal and courageous 29th Army under Feng Zhi'an has been transferred away from Beiping. The strategically important area of ​​the Baishi Mountain in western Beiping is now defended by security forces. What a heartbreaking blow this will be to the loyal and courageous soldiers! And the vast old capital of Beiping has no troops to defend it, allowing the enemy army to run rampant. In other words, Beiping City will become like eastern Hebei. How serious is this development? Moreover, the 17th Division is stationed in Zhuozhou, and Lugouqiao, this military stronghold, will follow in the footsteps of Juejue Terrace and become the object of Japanese control. In the future, the northern end of the Pinghan Railway will again fall into the hands of the enemy. How precarious will the situation in western Shanxi and southern Hebei be?</p>
<p>All of the above points are absolutely contrary to the four ultimate positions of our country stated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in his speech on the 17th. This situation is obviously intolerable to the people of the entire country. The basis for the Japanese actions at present is the agreement they signed with Zhang Zizhong in Tianjin on the 19th. The contents of this agreement have not been published, but the Japanese side believes that the agreements previously signed between the Japanese side and the local authorities of Hebei and Chahar have all been recognized by the central government, so this agreement will naturally not be a problem. The government of our country should issue the most severe refutation of this absurd and outrageous statement.</p>
<p>We believe that all past agreements that have damaged our country's territorial sovereignty should not be recognized. And the agreement that the Japanese side coerced the Hebei-Chahar authorities into signing this time should be refuted immediately. The transfer of the loyal and courageous troops of the 29th Army, the obstruction of activities to resist the enemy and save the nation in Beiping, and the permission for 100,000 invading troops to stay within our borders will create a very serious crisis in North China in the future. At this time, every Chinese person must not harbor the slightest illusion of peace. We believe that the dangerous situation created by the invaders in North China has reached the final point of our endurance. We must concentrate all the power of those above and below to strike head-on against the invaders' conspiracy to plunder North China.</p>

<p>[Tokyo] Premier Konoe will deliver a policy speech at the special Diet session. A draft has already been submitted for discussion at the cabinet meeting today. The Army and Navy Ministers and other cabinet members all expressed various opinions, which have not yet been concluded. It is planned that the cabinet will decide on the 24th, and the government's policy must be clearly communicated to the people regarding this North China Incident.

<h3>British Indulgence Fuels Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>Russian Newspaper Issues Strong Criticism, Chinese Resistance Grows Stronger</p>
<p>[Moscow] *Pravda* states, "Japan's aggression in North China is, of course, a major blow to the interests of other capitalist countries, and especially to Britain. However, we must point out that the British government has adopted a policy of compromise and indulgence towards aggressors in both the Far East and Europe. This policy, such as the recent commencement of British-Japanese talks, is unequivocally beneficial to the aggressive plans of Japanese imperialism. The incident in North China is part of Japan's preparation for a major war on the continent, and must be given serious attention." (TASS, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Moscow] *Izvestia* published an article that bitterly criticized the significance of the North China Incident. It began by saying, "The events of July 1937 bear a great resemblance to the Japanese seizure of Manchuria in the 'September 18th' Incident of 1931. It is easy to point out that, as six years ago, Japan is concentrating troops to intimidate China, while at the same time pretending to be calm in the hope of reducing the attention of the great powers. This significant similarity leads observant observers to believe that the current North China Incident is merely the first stage of a long-planned and comprehensive Japanese plan to conquer China for the second time. The success of Japan's occupation of Manchuria in the 'September 18th' Incident was the result of the passive attitude adopted by the Western European powers. There is no doubt about this. And Britain's open indulgence was the main factor in promoting Japanese aggression. At that time, a segment of British politicians completely misjudged the relationship between the powers in the Far East, believing that after Japan occupied Manchuria, it would not expand into China but would develop in other directions. Today, Britain is once again tending to adopt the same position as in 1931, which is truly lamentable and strange.</p>
<p>"The British Conservative newspapers, as six years ago, are still attempting to downplay the North China Incident, as if it has nothing to do with the interests of other countries. In other words, they are actually supporting the Japanese military clique and helping it cover up its well-prepared military actions. The British Conservatives are now repeating a policy in the Far East that has failed in the past, not only in the Far East, but also in East Africa and Western Europe. Conservative politicians are clearly intimidated by shows of force and intimidation, regardless of whether these methods come from the Far East or Central Europe."</p>
<p>*Izvestia* went on to point out that in 1931 Japan announced that its aggression would be limited to the territory of Manchuria, but in the end, it completely broke its promise and seized Rehe, created the puppet "government" of Eastern Hebei, forced the establishment of the so-called Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and seized six counties in northern Chahar. "Today, Japan is once again using force to occupy Beiping and Tianjin in North China, and is progressively preparing to invade central China by force. And its activities in Taiwan and other places even more clearly prove that southern China is also within its aggressive plans. In this situation, what is the use of still attempting to obtain a promise from the Japanese military clique to only partially continue their expansion plans? The only time that Japan will abandon its aggressive plans is when a certain government stops indulging such plans."</p>
<p>*Izvestia* then elaborated on the fact that British Under-Secretary of State Cranborne denied in May 1937 that Britain "intended to disrespect China's sovereignty," and asked, "Does not Britain's current erasure of the extreme importance of the North China Incident mean that Britain does not respect China's sovereignty? Not only that, but it even means that Britain is abandoning its interests in China, while at the same time demonstrating that London is repeating its miscalculations about the relationships between powers in the Far East."</p>
<p>Finally, *Izvestia* discussed the fundamental difference between the events of July 8th, 1937 and the "September 18th" Incident of six years ago, saying, "Without mentioning the decisive factor of the Soviet Union's many times stronger national power, there are also two points that should be pointed out. Since the past six years, the Chinese people's anti-Japanese movement has developed significantly, while Japan's rear has been greatly weakened and disturbed due to six years of adventurous policies. The current high prices in Japan, the expansion of the strike wave, the difficulties of financial rescue, and many other factors prove that the launch of this new stage of aggression against China is taking place under conditions of extreme domestic instability. On the other hand, since the outbreak of the new Sino-Japanese conflict, we have seen the increasingly strong development of China's anti-Japanese movement. At the same time, national consciousness and the people's hatred of the invaders have also been extremely aroused.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Britain's position in fact determined Japan's victory. Now, a serious moment has come again. The world powers, especially Britain, must again adopt a definite position. Will the North China Incident and the attitude of the powers toward it become the most important factor in the international situation?" (TASS, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Re-Discusses North China Issue</h3>
<p>Japan Refuses Third-Party Intervention, Japanese Ambassador to Britain States</p>
<p>[London] The British House of Commons re-discussed the North China issue this afternoon. Conservative MP Hepworth asked, in view of Japan's continued annexation of Chinese territory, could Foreign Secretary Eden declare that the British government would also refuse to recognize future annexations, as in the case of the Three Northeastern Provinces? Eden replied that the situation had not yet developed to that extent, so Hepworth's question seemed premature. Eden added that he hoped Hepworth would no longer expect him to predefine the government's attitude. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the North China Incident, the British government is now actively urging the United States to jointly act as a mediator. According to the *Evening Standard*, France will also participate in this action, but the hope of success is very slim, because in addition to the United States not necessarily participating in the mediation, the Japanese government strongly rejects any intervention. It is reported that the Japanese Ambassador to Britain has solemnly stated to British Foreign Secretary Eden that if the Japanese government were to accept any foreign mediation at the beginning of this crisis, it would inevitably arouse public anger throughout the country and overthrow the government. (National Seafarers News, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Eastern Newspaper's Opinion</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese newspapers do not consider the redeployment of the 37th Division in North China as a solution to the North China situation, believing that the fundamental points of the conflict still exist. Unless the root of the trouble is eradicated, future disputes will continue to arise. It is expected that Japan's policy regarding this matter will undergo major changes. According to the *Asahi Shimbun*, the Japanese government is advocating sending a key politician to Nanjing to begin negotiations on a fundamental solution to the Sino-Japanese problem.

(Central News Agency, Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>A Collection of Information from Northern Chahar</h3>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] During the evolution of the incident, the situation in northern Chahar is: ㊀ Several Japanese officers have been flying between Rehe and Huade in two or three planes, and have been holding secret meetings at each destination. They have been doing this for more than ten days without interruption, in a hurried manner, with extremely confidential content. ㊁ Special agents in Huade and Zhangbei are actively purchasing grains and miscellaneous items from various parts of northern Chahar and transporting them to Rehe, to be stored for military use in wartime. ㊂ Military transportation between Zhangjiakou and Duolun is frequent. Military supplies from Huade are being transported back to Duolun. ㊃ The airport at Shangdu, which was rushing to completion, has been suspended. Of the more than 500 workers employed, young and strong men have been selected and enlisted into the ranks by bandits. ㊄ Li Shou-hsin has not yet returned. It is said that Li is in Chengde, and another says he is still detained in the puppet capital. (Special Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>New Economic Agreement Established Between Japan and Italy</h3>
<p>Regulating Mutual Commercial Relations, Sugimura Transferred to Ambassador to France</p>
<p>[Rome] Sugimura Yōtarō, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, went to Paris this morning at 11:00 to take up his new post as Ambassador to France. Representatives from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and embassies of various countries were all at the station to welcome him. Before leaving Rome, Sugimura Yōtarō had negotiated an agreement with the Italian government to regulate the mutual commercial relations between Japan and the Italian colonies, but without any clauses of a political nature. According to reports, Japan's trade with the Italian colonies has always been carried out through merchants from India, Jewish countries, and the Near East. In the future, it will be replaced by the Italian economic system. As for the rumors that Abyssinian Emperor Selassie had granted concessions to Japan, and that Japan had requested the United States government to maintain this, these are not accurate. It is said that Japan did not obtain this concession. (Central News Agency, Havas, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Britain and Italy Plot and Struggle for Supremacy in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Rumors of Italy Building Fortresses on Spanish Islands, Modernization of Gibraltar Port Fortress</p>
<p>[Paris] It is rumored that the islands of Mahon and Ibiza in the Spanish Balearic Islands have been taken over by 600 Italian military experts, who have installed long-range artillery there to control the Mediterranean. It is claimed that the two islands have begun to be transformed into Mediterranean fortresses, with anti-aircraft guns, naval guns, underground aircraft hangars, machine rooms, powder magazines, and airfields large enough to accommodate 40 naval aircraft. In view of this rumor, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs has begun investigating it today. At the same time, it is reported that Italian officers have begun training 20,000 Spaniards, who could replace the Italian and German volunteers if the countries agree to withdraw their volunteers. Officials strongly claim that neither of the above two reports could be confirmed, but believe that if they are true, they are part of the rebel army's plan to cut off the connection between Madrid and Valencia. It is reported that because of the complexity of the international situation, Britain is eager to improve its relations with the Spanish National Army. Spanish Fascist leader Robles is currently serving as a representative of the rebel army, and also represents Portugal. If Britain reaches any agreement with the rebel army, Portugal can also participate. (National News, 22nd)</p>
<p>[London] A British government spokesperson told the House of Commons today that the expansion and improvement of the Gibraltar fortress began in 1934 and is still ongoing. He also said that, in the public interest, it is not appropriate to disclose the details and costs of this modernization plan. (Haitong News, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Britain Proposes a Questionnaire to Break the Deadlock on Non-Intervention</h3>
<p>Endless Debate on Procedural Matters of Compromise Proposals; Requesting Clear Expressions from All Related Countries</p>
<p>[London] The subcommittee under the Adjustment Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War previously appointed a technical committee to draft methods for monitoring Spanish ports. The said committee convened at 11:00 AM today, with secretaries and naval attachés from the embassies of all related countries in attendance. According to well-informed British sources, British experts have decided to request that all related countries submit written opinions within three days, expressing themselves clearly. This is to prevent these countries from using procedural debates to endlessly delay stating their true intentions. Britain may also present a questionnaire to the related countries, requesting responses by Monday or Tuesday of next week. This questionnaire is expected to include six or seven questions. Once France's views are clearly understood, a decision will be made today. It is reported that Italy is still using all diplomatic means to avoid the responsibility of failed negotiations. (Havas Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the discussion process for various proposals concerning the non-intervention issue in the Spanish conflict, it is heard that the British government has now drafted a brand-new plan. However, they do not intend to notify other governments of this plan until the subcommittee convenes. Furthermore, since the subcommittee must first discuss this new plan at its next meeting, the examination of the proposals themselves will inevitably have to be temporarily shelved. It is also heard that the final form of this new plan is still under discussion by the British government authorities, but it is not impossible for it to be submitted to the subcommittee before the end of this week. At the same time, the Italian representative in London stated that Italy has no intention of refusing to discuss the issue of the withdrawal of volunteers from Spain. Angelico Grandi, the Italian ambassador, has also declared to the British Foreign Secretary that Italy's attitude is not aimed at shelving the issue. However, the Italian side feels that granting belligerent rights to both sides in the Spanish war would be a way to enhance the monitoring system, so it should be discussed before the issue of volunteer withdrawal. But this view does not completely negate the possibility of compromise. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Pacific Defense Issues</h3>
<p>Question Raised in British House of Commons</p>
<p>[London] Member of Parliament Mandel of the Liberal Party raised a question regarding the construction of defensive works on the American-owned Aleutian Islands and the British-owned Hong Kong in the Pacific Ocean. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Cranborne, gave an immediate reply, stating that the Ogasawara Islands, Amami Ōshima, and the Ryukyu Islands all belong to Japan and are not mandated territories under the League of Nations. Their defensive works were stipulated by Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty, which requires them to be maintained in their original state. This is the same as for the Aleutian Islands and Hong Kong. However, since the Washington Naval Treaty expired on December 31, 1936, the effect of Article 19 has not been extended. The future defense of these islands should be decided by the related countries through appropriate measures, without any further restrictions. As for the islands mandated by the League of Nations to Japan, namely the Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, and Mariana Islands, they are still subject to the restrictions contained in the mandate system and may not build naval or military bases or construct defensive works. As for the defense issues of the islands belonging to Japan and the United States (i.e., the islands restricted from fortification under Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty), we are not fully aware of future plans. Speaking of Hong Kong, we are only renovating the original defenses, which is permitted under Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty. No other new measures have been decided.

Consequently, both Czech and Romanian individuals criticized him, leading to his forced dismissal. (National Maritime Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Changes in Senior Soviet Government Officials</h3>

<p>[Moscow] The Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union has decided to appoint Mikoyan, the Commissar of the Food Industry, as the Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. Yulkin has been appointed as the Commissar of Soviet State Grain and Livestock Farms. Furthermore, the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) has decided to appoint Bulganin as the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the RSFSR. (TASS, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Purge</h3>
<p>Extremely Broad Scope</p>
<p>[Paris] "Le Petit Parisien" correspondent in Moscow, Roussaniani, recently published a lengthy article detailing the Soviet purge and continuing to list the surnames of senior Soviet officials recently condemned. He stated briefly, "For several weeks, the purge carried out by the Soviet authorities has been extremely broad in scope." In the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, following the dismissal of Deputy Commissar Krestinsky, those who have been subsequently dismissed include former Ambassador to Turkey Karakhan (who previously served as Ambassador to China), former Ambassador to Spain Rosenholz, former Ambassador to Afghanistan Stark, Director of the German Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs Stein, and Director of the Administrative Department Sukman. In the People's Commissariat for Health, those dismissed include senior official Kaminsky. In the People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade, those included are senior officials Rosenholz and Roganosky. In the People's Commissariat for Agriculture, those included are senior official Tsilko and Deputy Director of the State Farm Affairs Bureau Ostrolovsky. In addition, it is rumored that former Director of the Political Police Department Syrtsov, President of the Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Yaroshevsky, former editor of Pravda and old friend of Lenin Rabinovich, and many scholars are suspected of being counter-revolutionaries. The managers of the National Grand Theater, National Small Theater, and the Art Theater are all in custody. Other senior personnel from the State Bank, various factories, various trade unions, and various economic organizations, regardless of whether they are technical or administrative personnel, who are suspected of being reactionary have been dismissed. Regarding the various republics, People's Commissars of the Russian Republic Derotaite, Chervyakov, Diagov, and Benack, and People's Commissar of Light Industry of the Georgian Republic Ramishvili, and People's Commissars of the Uzbek Republic Gotyaev and Kukunshen have all been dismissed. In the Far East, since the recent two months, more than 214 reactionary elements have been sentenced to death. "The above is a general overview of the Soviet purge. It is to be expected that the reactionary elements, in addition to those who have already been executed, will be investigated and dealt with according to the law." (Havas Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>US Judicial Reform Plan Dies</h3>
<p>Senate Orders Judiciary Committee to Draft New Bill; Major Blow to President Roosevelt</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt's Supreme Court reform bill died today because the Senate recently voted 70 to 20 to refer the bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instructing it to prepare a new proposal. Before the Senate vote, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a meeting. Vice President Garner acknowledged that the Supreme Court reform case was no longer an issue, but asked the committee to mediate the dispute with sincere words and tears in his eyes. Therefore, the Judiciary Committee agreed to request that the case be returned to the committee, so that a new method of dealing specifically with the problems of the lower courts could be drafted within ten days. It is heard that the new plan drafted by the Judiciary Committee will include cases involving constitutional law being able to be directly appealed to the Supreme Court, and the appointment of lower court judges not being limited by the age of existing judges. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the judicial reform bill proposed by President Roosevelt, the Senate recently overturned the amendments passed by the Judiciary Committee. This is the first major political blow to President Roosevelt since he was re-elected last November. The reason is that this amendment does not mention the Supreme Court at all, but only stipulates the issue of the advancement and retreat of judges in the lower courts, and advocates that the president should only select successors when judges leave office, rather than using age as a standard for retirement. This attitude of the Senate has shocked my political faction, who deeply believe that the Supreme Court will continue to obstruct the president's various plans to improve the economic structure and improve the lives of workers.

<h3>US Farmers Borrow Money at Low Interest to Purchase Land</h3>
<p>Both Houses Pass Bill; Presidential Veto Ineffective</p>
<p>⊙Washington Regarding the law that allows farmers to borrow money to buy land and reduces interest rates, both houses of Congress recently passed a bill to extend the effective period for one year. However, President Roosevelt vetoed it because it would increase the next budget expenditure by $30 million. The House of Representatives specifically proposed a review of the bill on the 13th of this month, and still maintained the original plan with a majority of 260 votes to 97 votes. The Senate also maintained the original plan with a majority of 71 votes to 19 votes today. Both houses passed it again with more than two-thirds of the votes, so the presidential veto was ineffective, and the new law was established. (Havas Agency, 21st)</p>
<h3>US Government Gold Reserves Decrease</h3>

The remaining balance is $1,170,821,774. It is understood that this is the result of the currency agreements concluded between the United States and China and Brazil. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Marconi's Remains Buried</h3>
<p>Solemn Ceremony</p>
<p>⊙Bologna The funeral of Marconi, the great inventor of wireless telegraphy, was held here today. The ceremony was very solemn. In the morning, 200,000 people gathered on the streets and corners to watch the funeral procession. The procession proceeded from the station to the Basilica of San Petronio. After a special train from Rome arrived here, the Civil Administrator of Rome officially handed over Marconi's remains to the local governor of Bologna. Then the army fired a salute to pay tribute, and Archbishop Soga blessed the remains. The vehicles then set off towards the Basilica, with Marconi's wife and daughter following in the vehicle. The Duke of Genoa represented the King of Italy, and the Minister of Education represented the Italian government, also holding wreaths behind the vehicle. The remains were then buried in the Marconi family's cemetery. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Wu Dingchang Discusses Adequate Grain Reserves in Various Regions</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Minister of Industry Wu issued a statement on the grain issue, stating that in the past, whenever something happened, a few merchants in various cities would take the opportunity to create rumors in an attempt to make huge profits. Citizens did not investigate and were often alarmed. This kind of phenomenon has become a habit. This time, after the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the national public was very calm because of the good harvests of last year, and there was no problem with their lives. However, a city or two still had doubts about the grain issue. This is because they did not understand the current situation of grain supply and demand and were deceived by rumors spread by a few people. I cannot but clearly inform you of the facts. Rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains were all harvested well last year. The output of Hsien and Keng rice increased from 87,050,700 shih tan (a unit of dry measure) in the previous year to 87,100,020 shih tan, an increase of 465,000 shih tan. The output of wheat increased from 42,605,200 shih tan in the previous year to 46,150,500 shih tan, an increase of 2,550,300 shih tan. The fact that the original rice and wheat were more than in previous years has already become a fact. (At least an average of two shih tan of grain and rice and one shih tan of wheat or more can be allocated to each person, regardless of age or gender, and miscellaneous grains are not included.) Now that the autumn harvest is very near, there are still quite a lot of food reserves. I will also list the average market prices of rice-producing areas in the past week as proof. I hope that the authorities in major cities should, first, explain the actual situation of grain supply and demand at any time and prohibit rumors; third, there is currently no need to use manpower to restrict the sale of grain; second, the governments of major cities should establish grain transportation and marketing agencies. If the people transport and sell themselves, and they do not have enough capacity, they can entrust this agency to handle it at any time. If the local agencies do not have enough capacity, they can entrust the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau to assist them. In areas outside of cities, because the stock of rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains is quite large, there is no problem at all, and there is no need to pay attention. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>At Year-End, Ministry Orders Prompt Clearance of Accounts</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance believes that fiscal year 25 has ended, and the national treasury revenues and expenditures urgently need to be organized and cleared. It has recently issued a circular ordering customs, salt tax, and other tax revenue agencies to promptly remit any unremitted funds from collection to the treasury. Any payments that have not been offset should also be submitted to the Ministry for offsetting and transferred to the treasury accounts in accordance with the prescribed procedures, so as to facilitate the closing of accounts. As for the income tax for fiscal year 25, which has received more than 5.7 million yuan, exceeding the budgeted amount by more than 700,000 yuan, since the tax revenue is collected by the bank on behalf of the government and remitted to the national treasury as it is collected, it has in fact already been closed at the end of the year, so it is not included in this collection call.

<h3>The Activities of Japanese and Taiwanese Residents in Xiamen</h3>
<p>Commander Okuma Stationed in Xiamen Commands Fleets in Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou; Taiwanese Residents Request the Japanese Consul to Order Marines to Land; Provincial Government Orders All Agencies to Actively Protect Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Lugouqiao Incident has caused great tension. The activities of Japanese and Taiwanese residents in Fujian Province are particularly noteworthy. A brief record is as follows: ① Commander Okuma of the Japanese Fifth Squadron arrived in Xiamen on the 9th aboard the flagship Yubari, and remained in Xiamen until the 20th. Following Gulangyu, the two Japanese warships Asagao and Asakaze, newly arrived in Fuzhou, separated at Qingwangu Bay on the 18th. However, the warship Hatakaze arrived in Fuzhou on the 19th. Currently, all Japanese warships in Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou are under the警戒 of the Fifth Squadron, with Okuma commanding from Xiamen. ② At 6:00 PM on the 18th, eight foreigners arrived by motorboat at Elephant Nose Peak Mountain in Songyu County (the starting point of the Zhangzhou-Songyu Road) across from Xiamen. Six of them, carrying cameras and other equipment, landed to survey and photograph the mountain. This was discovered by the local militia, who immediately reported to the stationed troops there. Several warning shots were fired, and the foreigners hastily got into their car and fled. That evening, Songyu was placed under special curfew. ③ Jinmen County is an island outside Xiamen Port. At 2:00 PM on the 18th, a strange plane flew from northwest to southeast over the county seat, flying very high and unidentifiable by color. ④ Taiwanese residents in Xiamen have been daily submitting requests to the Japanese consul, asking for a large military force and warships to be sent to Xiamen, and for marines to be landed to protect overseas residents. They also requested permission to organize a plainclothes volunteer corps. The Japanese consul replied that the time was not yet ripe. On the night of the 20th, the Taiwanese residents held meetings in three locations. The Japanese consulate sent Japanese police officers to the scene. ⑤ A certain authority sent residents Chen and Zheng to Zhangzhou and Quanzhou to gather military intelligence. Both are intellectual professionals. Chen had previously served as a staff member in a Zhangzhou agency, and Zheng was previously involved in the handling of unclaimed goods in Quanzhou. People in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou rarely recognize them as Taiwanese residents. ⑥ The towns in the third district of Jinjiang County outside the south gate of Quanzhou are coastal areas and have long been a base for activities of Taiwanese residents of a certain party. On the 15th, three drifters came from Xiamen to Shishi and stayed at the home of a Mr. Zeng. The next day, they summoned five doctors surnamed Cai, who are Taiwanese residents in Quanzhou, for a very secretive meeting.</p>
<p>To actively protect overseas residents, the provincial government, on the 19th, ordered the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau and the Xiamen Municipal Government to re-investigate in detail the number and occupational status of Japanese and Taiwanese residents in Fuzhou and Xiamen. Those who meet the qualifications after verification with the Japanese consulate will be given strict protection. Xiamen Mayor Li Shilin flew back to Xiamen from the province on the 20th and immediately summoned all police chiefs to strictly protect foreigners. There are very few Japanese residents in Fuzhou and Xiamen, about 300 in each. There are fewer than 1,000 registered Taiwanese residents in Fuzhou, and over 9,000 in Xiamen, with an estimated 18,000 unregistered. The Heshan Special District Office (i.e., all of Xiamen outside the Xiamen urban area) has also received provincial orders to re-register in detail the household registration of foreigners, all to prevent future troubles.</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the Lugouqiao Incident, in addition to public prices fluctuating with the Shanghai market, the prices of various Japanese goods have increased. From July 8th to 19th, within ten days, rice increased by 6.5 to 7 jiao per hundred market pounds, beans increased by 1.5 to 4 jiao, soybean oil increased by 1.4 yuan, and flour increased from 4.4 yuan to 5.2 yuan per bag (July 21st).</p>
<h3>The Sandbags on the Streets Have Been Removed</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Last night, I heard from an American priest at Fu Jen Catholic University that the American consulate had said tomorrow (the 20th) is a crucial moment. However, for over ten days, I have developed a habit of not easily believing things. On the 15th, I heard that the enemy was fiercely attacking. On the 17th, I heard that the enemy had issued an ultimatum, demanding the army withdraw within 24 hours, but war has not yet broken out. The situation is consistently depressing. Some time ago, there was a rumor that a certain railway bureau director had been detained. Yesterday, there was another rumor that a certain mayor's residence had been bombed. None of these have been verified. It only shows where the people's hearts lie. In fact, these two important figures are the most powerful elements working for peace.</p>
<p>I have been running around inside the city for a week. Today (the 19th), I wanted to go outside the city to take a look. I went out at 10:30 AM. Xizhimen was still only half-open, with many sandbags piled up beside it. After the curfew at night, this sandbag surface would be full of the 29th Army brothers, standing ready to fire. The suburban avenues were still peaceful. I only saw a few people moving into the city. When I got to Tsinghua Garden, I heard that there had been shooting and shelling all night yesterday west of the school, because plainclothes troops were causing trouble in Hongshankou, west of the Xiyuan barracks. The school was generally quiet, but some people were leaving the school with luggage. Because I wanted to pay attention to every minute of the development of the incident in Beiping, I was afraid of being trapped outside the city and not being able to participate in the great scene, so after lunch, I took the 1:00 PM bus back to the city.</p>
<p>The school bus passed Xisi Pailou. The 29th Army soldiers beside it were moving sandbags. Since the shelling at Lugouqiao, sandbags had been piled up at each city gate and each important street intersection in Beiping. For ten days, the sandbags had been increasing. From initially arranging a row of sandbags, only able to lie down behind them, bag after bag was added, gradually allowing kneeling fire and providing cover for machine guns, to now allowing standing fire behind them, with wide and deep trenches dug beside them. I watched the 29th Army brothers working hard there, wearing only white shirts, and a feeling of gratitude welled up in my heart. I thought about how a few friends had volunteered to help them stack the sandbags higher the day before yesterday and yesterday, and I said to the classmate in the same car, "We should go down and help them. This can give them considerable encouragement." As I was saying this, the school bus had already driven past.</p>
<p>I got off the bus and walked to the intelligence department of the All-Circles People's Anti-Enemy Support Association. A friend greeted me with a sigh, "The news is bad."</p>
<p>"Is the enemy launching a general attack tomorrow?" I thought of the news I had heard yesterday. Unexpectedly, the reply I received was, "That would be great. The news is that we have accepted the conditions. The sandbags on the streets have all been removed."</p>
<p>I told them not to believe it easily, because I had just seen them seeming to be adding sandbags on the street. But another person said that he had just ridden his bike to the main streets in the eastern and western parts of the city and that they were indeed being removed. I had no choice but to admit that I had overlooked it. Several people were grumbling and angry in the courtyard. The intelligence in the room still had to be sent out: "Peace, or humiliation?" in large characters. Below it was, "Rumors of the Sino-Japanese Agreement Being Signed in Tianjin"... "Sandbags on the Streets of Beiping Are Being Removed..." For the past few days, professors had been working together in the support association, hot and busy, but now they had been doused with cold water.</p>
<p>"Chairman Song has returned to Beiping. He passed by Fengtai. The Japanese soldiers even saluted him. When he arrived in Beiping, he denied that he had signed anything," someone reported.</p>
<p>"Perhaps he will still deny it," another person continued. "People on the street saw the sandbags being removed and all said 'It's over.' But their tones were different. Some were heartbroken, and some were relieved."</p>
<p>"We have been busy for several days. We definitely won't be allowed to do this again," a third person predicted. "What about the 29th Army brothers? They have chopped down enemies and been wounded, piled up sandbags and stood guard. Now they have to tear it all down themselves and have to withdraw from the city of Beiping. How can they endure this?"</p>
<p>I thought of the countless wounded soldiers in the Weishu Hospital, especially the two 29th Army soldiers around seventeen years old. They were groaning and moaning while telling us how they used their "broadswords" to chop off many heads, how happy and satisfying it was. There was also that platoon leader at Fuchengmen, who puffed out his chest and lectured us, "We soldiers are willing to go to the front line and risk our lives. We hope that you all will take care of things in the rear." He was so spirited, so proud of what he said. But now I can't bear to think about their heroic resistance, their heroic sacrifices, and their excited appearance.</p>
<p>Walking out of the support association, I sat in a rickshaw and thought, "For more than ten days, I gave up writing and disrupted my daily life. Now it's back to normal. We still have to endure this and turn this anger into accumulated strength, waiting for a more violent eruption. Before my eyes, I still have to pick up the pen and first report these events, paying tribute to the 29th Army brothers who died for the nation."</p>
<p>Passing by Xisi Pailou, the sandbags were indeed removed. Cleaners were sweeping the ash and dirt on the side of the street with bamboo strips.</p>
<p>But in front of the Beining Railway Business Office and the China Travel Service, there were still large piles of suitcases and trunks being loaded. I thought, "They heard the news. Are they heartbroken or happy?" (July 19th afternoon)</p>

<p>Various Counties Prepare to Raise Autumn Silkworms</p>
<p>Due to the climate this year in Zhejiang Province, the spring and summer silkworm seasons in various counties were not good, and the silk cocoon collections were poor. In order to remedy the rural economy, the Provincial Authorities are massively promoting autumn silkworms. They have separately ordered 550,000 improved silkworm egg sheets from various silk farms in Jiangsu Province, and 840,000 sheets will be supplied by various farms in Zhejiang Province, to be distributed to various counties in the silkworm-raising areas. Because the autumn silkworm season is about to begin, the 500 supervisors from the various improvement zones have been hired, and they are scheduled to depart for work on August 1st. There are only about 10,000 dan of summer rain pasture altogether, and the collection office will be completely closed at the end of the month. The provincial expenses and affairs will be handled concurrently by the improvement zone.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Strenuously Arguing Against the Wheat Business Tax</p>
<p>The Wuxi Business Tax Bureau recently received orders to investigate the flour mills and collect a temporary business tax on wheat from the grain dealers on behalf of the brokers. The Chamber of Commerce sent letters to Tong Ru Mao Xin, Jiu Feng, Guang Feng, and various flour mills, as well as wheat dealers stationed in Wuxi from other places, to discuss the matter at the Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning. At that time, the Suzhou Taihe Flour Mill was reporting the shipment of wheat, but the Business Tax Bureau did not issue a tax-exempt passport because it did not have the procedure for collecting the temporary business tax on its behalf, resulting in the suspension of transport. The factories were all extremely indignant, and unanimously decided to telegraph the ministry to strenuously argue against the tax, and to hire lawyers to prepare to sue according to the law.</p>
<p>Two Bizarre Murder Cases</p>
<p>Behind Rongxiang Town in the fourth district of the county, there is a Lotus Mountain. The graves on the mountain are numerous, and it is rarely visited. At the foot of the mountain is a village called Gongxiang, belonging to the Da Chi township in the fourth district. Zhang Hairong, a resident of the village, often had the grass and trees on his graves cut down by others, so he ordered his eight-year-old niece, Xiuzhen, to watch over them. At 5:00 PM on the 21st, Xiuzhen went up the mountain again, but when she passed behind the ancestral grave of Yu Peigen halfway up the mountain, she suddenly discovered a corpse lying in the weeds. She was so frightened that she ran wildly down the mountain and told the villagers. The corpse was tall and burly, wearing a white-collared western shirt on its upper body, yellow khaki western pants on its lower body, gray socks on its feet, and round-toed black cloth-soled leather shoes. A soft-brimmed straw hat was left beside the body. The face was rotten and blurred and unrecognizable. The back of the head had been eaten by wild animals. Judging from the situation, the corpse had been lying there for a week. On the 22nd, the heads of the twenty-third and sixth tus of the area, Han Rongsheng and Ding Jinfu, reported to the court, requesting an autopsy. Also, the male corpse on the first branch road of Zhoushanbang, named Dai A’de, was an employee of the Youyi Printing House. There were wounds on the neck and serious injuries on the chest and abdomen. It was indeed a bizarre murder case. The murderer was definitely not one person. The court has already verified the facts and has begun an investigation to arrest the murderer according to the law.</p>

It is divided into four departments: archives, commerce, crafts, and general studies. The Chen family building at No. 4 Yicheng Lane on Dashikou Road is temporarily used as the school building. Yang Shuwang (wife of Director Zhou), Li Songhu (wife of Director Zhao), Wang Huangying (wife of the director of the provincial hospital), Leng Yuqiu, Ye Xiufeng, Jiang Wenyu, Wu Yun’er, Lin Kanghou, Yang Weiyu, Pan Yangyao, and others have been hired as school board members, and preparations have been completed. Enrollment has officially begun, and many women from all walks of life have come to register in recent days.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Fruit Disturbance Occurs</p>
<p>The local police station, for the sake of public health in the summer and the health of the people, has appointed health police to specifically inspect various food stores. According to reports from various fruit shops to the guild, the health police arbitrarily find fault. For any fruit that has even a slight blemish, they immediately detain and fine the people involved, causing both mental and material sacrifice. They convened a meeting of the same industry to dare to petition the county party headquarters for relief. If this is not successful, the entire industry will close down to avoid accidental losses, which is a very serious situation. On the 23rd, the police station convened a meeting of the town chiefs in the city and countryside to report on the progress of the sanitary inspection. It is hoped that persuasion from all sides will prevent the situation from escalating.</p>

<p>Planning to Establish a Cotton Weaving Factory</p>
<p>Jiang Yansheng, a local resident, in order to develop the county's industry and to alleviate the rural economy, specifically joined forces with wealthy businessmen in Shanghai to plan to establish a large-scale cotton weaving factory.

<p>Intensifying the Urging of Accumulated Grain Collection</p>
<p>Deng County's landlords, homeowners, merchants, and other accumulated grain owed from the twenty-fifth year, as well as the accumulated grain of wealthy households about to be levied, are all to be collected. The previous provincial order to revise the standards for collecting accumulated grain refers to the accumulated grain to be collected from July of the twenty-sixth year to June of the twenty-seventh year. Therefore, the amount for the twenty-fifth year should still be collected according to the original amount. The county government, fearing that the payers would misunderstand the year and use the already-lowered collection standards as an excuse, ordered the authorities to intensify collection and explain to the payers to avoid misunderstanding.</p>

Suspicious items were found on him, and he was escorted to the county for detention.</p>
<p>Concealing Smuggled Opium Reported</p>
<p>Wu Zhu, a resident of Xiangtai Sheng Sauce Garden on Lower West Street, Fengjing, Jiashan, was previously reported by 保长 Shen Xinyuan for selling opium with his son-in-law. The Public Security Bureau dispatched police to arrest them, seizing more than 100 yong of opium and arresting Wu Zhu and his son-in-law. However, only 30 liang of opium were handed over to the county. Locals believed that concealing opium was a crime and reported it to the provincial government, which has sent personnel twice to investigate in detail.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>

However, they have now received an order from the Ministry of Railways stating that, in addition to repairing the Puqin Road, it has also been decided to add a branch line to the Puxin Road to facilitate transportation. They are also to survey this line to facilitate progress. After surveying the area, the team determined that the Puxin branch line passes through the boundaries of Fei County, including Lan'ganji, Wenji, Shitangqiao, and Dianbu. It was decided to set up stakes along the line within days to serve as measurement standards, and the two county governments were instructed to order the twenty-sixth district to take extra care to protect them.</p>
<h3>Funing</h3>
<p>Confiscated Smuggled Wheat Boats</p>
<p>For several days, boat prices in the county have been soaring due to merchants smuggling goods out of the area. County Magistrate Zheng Shuxian, realizing this, issued a strict prohibition. Yesterday, the Goudun Police Station confiscated ten boats that were smuggling wheat, and sent the boat owners Yao Guangyou, Yan Dezhao, Mao Xueliang, Zheng Bingchen, Zeng Guangdao, Shi Shande, Zhang Baoguo, and others to the county government for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Xiang Songpo and Others Telegraph Chiang and Song, Volunteering to Fight the Enemy</h3>
<p>Li Ling Also Went to Beijing to Petition</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang Songpo, a revolutionary pioneer, is extremely indignant about the rampant actions of the Japanese. In the past two days, he telegraphed Chiang and Song separately, saying: ① To Chairman Song in Beiping and all the soldiers of the 29th Army, We salute you. The Japanese army is tyrannical, provoking attacks, humiliating our national rights, and seizing our territory. What sentient being can endure this? Your resistance is courageous and inspiring, and worthy of the heroes of our nation. Now the government has a firm attitude, and the people are united as one. The morale of the front line is even more elevated, and the survival of the nation is at stake. Having retreated into obscurity on the Shanghai waterfront, I am still willing to follow the spirit of the Premier's overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and restoring the Ming Dynasty, leading the able-bodied men in the country who have always taken safeguarding the nation as their duty, and volunteering to the government to rise up and deal with them. I am willing to sacrifice myself. I respectfully express my feelings to encourage each other. Xiang Haiqian bows in reverence. ② To Chairman Chiang in Nanjing, I salute you. The tyranny of the Japanese is shocking the world. Reading Your Excellency's announcement of the Four Principles, with the determination to sacrifice to the end as a guarantee for the survival of the nation, your words are stern and your righteousness is just, and both China and foreign countries are drinking from it. Although I am not talented, I believe that as an outsider, I can lead the able-bodied men in the country to fight to the death with the brutal invaders. As long as there is one breath left, I will have no concern. I am grief-stricken and awaiting orders. I respectfully express my feelings. Xiang Haiqian bows in reverence.</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Li Ling, director of the Shanghai China Detective Agency, recently, in light of the serious national crisis, went to Beijing today to volunteer to the authorities to fight against the enemy. According to Li, at this critical juncture of life and death, our people can no longer afford to wait and see. We must destroy our homes to relieve the national crisis, and be prepared to be the government's rearguard, in order to fulfill our duties as citizens.</p>
<h3>Business Leaders in Metal Industry Decide to Prevent</h3>
<p>Outward Transport of Scrap Iron</p>
<p>Several trade associations in this city's metal industry, including the metal scrap industry and the metal parts industry, have noted that since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, unscrupulous individuals in this city have begun secretly collecting scrap iron for outward transport. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, a joint meeting was held on the third floor of the City Commerce Bureau to discuss preventative measures. After representatives from each association presented the advantages and disadvantages, and contributed their opinions, a decision was made on measures to be implemented after approval from the City Social Affairs Bureau, effective immediately.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Federation Sends Telegram to Overseas Chinese, Urging Joint Effort in National Crisis</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation, in order to jointly face the national crisis, sent a telegram by express mail to returned overseas Chinese nationwide, stating that since the September 18th Incident, six years have passed. The military and civilians nationwide have been cultivating national strength and seeking peace, not hesitating to endure humiliation and burden and turning blood into tears. However, the nation's land is finite, while the enemy's ambition is insatiable. The violent Japanese have already forcibly occupied the four northeastern provinces, creating a puppet state in the past, and then invaded eastern Hebei and northern Chahar, disrupting the hinterland. Today, they launched the Lugouqiao Incident, attempting to sweep across North China in one fell swoop, in order to fulfill their dream of conquering China and dominating East Asia. Today's event, as Chairman Chiang has pointed out, has reached the final critical moment for the nation's survival. All citizens with life and spirit must mobilize and engage in resistance under the leadership of the government and great leaders, defending the homeland and recovering lost territories. However, unity in action is paramount, and strength can only be concentrated through concerted effort. The Federation believes that overseas Chinese have always been known for their patriotic fervor, and the comrades in returning overseas Chinese groups have made special contributions to the nation. Now, it is planned to start with overseas Chinese groups in various domestic regions, thoroughly connect and solicit opinions, in order to achieve unified national salvation. If you agree, please reply immediately. We eagerly await your response. The Overseas Chinese Federation.</p>
<h3>An Open Letter to Women from the China Women's Support Association</h3>
<p>The enemy's bayonets are pointed at our hearts; let us join our male compatriots in shouldering the responsibility of national salvation. The China Women's Anti-Japanese Support Association, initiated and organized by He Xiangning, held its inaugural meeting at He's residence at 4:00 PM on the 22nd. The wives of Sun Song Qingling, Kong Xiangxi, Cai Yuanpei, and Yu Hongjun were invited to serve as directors, and personnel were assigned to various groups such as general affairs,慰劳, recruitment, and rescue, and will begin active work immediately. It was also decided to expand and establish branches throughout the country. The Association specifically issued an open letter to women nationwide yesterday, the original text of which is as follows: Since the "September 18th" Incident, the enemy, like wolves and tigers, has occupied our four northeastern provinces and invaded and disrupted our North China. This time, the provocative and violent act at Lugouqiao has especially aroused the indignation of our entire nation. Everyone is thinking of rushing to the front lines to resist the war. We all feel that our years of enduring humiliation and seeking peace have only emboldened the enemy to become even more reckless and rampant. They neither respect international conventions nor disregard our national sovereignty. What diplomacy is there to speak of? Now is the final moment for our nation to fight for survival. Only national unity and resistance against the enemy is our only way out. Chairman Chiang's recent declaration of four points is precisely the common aspiration of our country, both government and public. All our compatriots, men and women, are willing to shed our last drop of blood rather than see our nation perish and become slaves to a foreign power. However, resisting the enemy is the responsibility of our entire nation. Our young and strong women compatriots can naturally also bravely go to the front lines and take up arms to fight. However, generally speaking, for our sisters, everyone can do something for support work, such as rescue,慰劳, and so on. Now that the war is about to begin, and in such hot weather, the heroic soldiers on the front lines are bathed in blood in the trenches, and the disaster victims in the war zone are under enemy fire, with no homes to return to. Please think about it, who doesn't have brothers and sisters? Who doesn't have parents and children? The enemy's bullets and bayonets, who dares to guarantee that they can escape? Therefore, we specifically initiate and organize the "China Women's Anti-Japanese Support Association" to join our male compatriots in facing the national crisis and mobilizing organizations throughout the country, shouting loudly: Now is the final moment for our nation to fight for survival. Sisters who unanimously do not want to be slaves to a foreign country, please get up quickly. Those who have strength contribute their strength, those who have money contribute their money, those who can go to the battlefield go to the battlefield, and those who can rescue and慰劳 come out to do rescue and慰劳 work. The enemy's guns are already aimed at our hearts. The enemy's knives are already raised at our necks. We cannot seek to survive by luck, nor can we seek to preserve ourselves partially. Going forward is our only way out. We can only unite to resist the war, resist the war, resist the war! Patriotic women compatriots, please get up quickly!</p>

<h3>Actively Carrying Out Emergency Rescue in Times of Emergency</h3>
<p>Liu Ruiheng Convenes Leaders from All Walks of Life to Discuss Measures; Requests 200,000 from Song Ziwen for Emergency Use</p>
<p>Leaders from all walks of life Organize Emergency Rescue. Liu Ruiheng, Director of the National Government's Department of Health, came to Shanghai from Beijing on the 21st due to the tense war situation in North China. That evening, at the International Hotel, he invited more than 20 leaders from the city's medical, pharmaceutical, and financial sectors, including Wang Xiaolai, Wen Lantao, Lu Bohong, Yan Fuqing, and Li Ting'an, to discuss the organization of emergency rescue measures during times of emergency. According to Liu, under the current tense situation on the front lines in North China, there is an urgent need for preparations for emergency rescue. Therefore, all regions should promptly find ways to establish emergency rescue organizations, and maintain close contact with local Red Cross societies and local health agencies to prepare for the arrival of times of emergency. At present, it is particularly necessary to urgently carry out emergency rescue for soldiers on the front lines in North China, because we cannot sit idly by and watch the lives of heroic soldiers who have sacrificed for the country perish when medical efficacy can save them, and so on. Subsequently, other attendees expressed their opinions on the preparations for engaging in emergency rescue, and all expressed their agreement in principle. It was decided to formally discuss the progress in the near future. It is also learned that Liu's visit was motivated by the lack of rescue supplies in our country, so he has consulted with Song Ziwen to find a way to allocate 200,000 to purchase medicines, gauze, cloth, bandages, rubber plasters, and other items to meet needs.</p>
<p>Women Pay Attention to Air Defense and Rescue</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's New Life Movement Promotion Association believes that people should have various preparations for emergency situations, and that air defense and rescue work are extremely important. It deeply feels the lack of knowledge of women in air defense and rescue, so the board of directors decided to establish a rescue class to teach battlefield rescue and simple treatment methods free of charge. Anyone interested in or enthusiastic about rescue work is welcome to enroll. Registration begins today at the Public Education Center and Renhe Hospital on Molly Avenue. Classes are scheduled to officially begin on August 15th. It is stipulated that every week from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, battlefield rescue bandage science and first aid general treatment methods will be taught. From 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, knowledge of air defense and anti-poisoning will be taught. The course is scheduled to graduate in three months. According to the person in charge of the association, in this time of national crisis, everyone has the duty to serve the country, and our female compatriots should also rise up to save the country, and it is especially appropriate to take on rescue work. It is also learned that the Shanghai Women's Promotion Association is now initiating the organization of rescue teams, with 21 people per team. When each team is fully staffed, a doctor will lead the team to stand by for departure.</p>
<p>Red Swastika Society Work Report</p>
<p>The Lugouqiao Incident in Pingxi occurred. The World Red Swastika Society Rescue Team has already dispatched a team to the war zone for relief. The previous report has been recorded.

On the 13th, the team departed from Chechengmen and detoured through Bali Village, Agricultural College, Madaomiao, Hetaoyuan, Zaolin Village, and Siqingdi villages to Wanping County. A total of 112 injured and sick soldiers and civilians were treated outside the west gate. In addition, the poor people in the county city and surrounding areas were unable to make a living due to the incident. The team, together with the village chiefs, provided emergency relief to more than 160 people. On the 14th and 15th, team members were dispatched to various important urban areas for patrols and treatment, and summer medicine was distributed. Subsequent work situations will be reported in due course.</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Association Trains Rescuers</p>
<p>In order to comprehensively discuss the relief of war-zone refugees, the Joint Relief and Disaster Relief Association of Charitable Organizations established a design committee the other day to be responsible for planning and carrying out related matters.

<h3>Famous American Educator Talks About the North China Incident</h3>
<p>The Activities of the Japanese in North China Arouse Strong Discontent in Western America</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that Mr. Anderson, a famous educator who has served in Shanghai for many years and is now the principal of the American Field-American Guardian College, is in Shanghai for a short summer trip. Dr. Anderson and his wife arrived in Shanghai on Sunday. They originally intended to lead other American travelers on a trip to North China. However, they have now canceled this trip due to the incident in North China and returned to their home country. Dr. and Mrs. Anderson plan to stay in Shanghai for a few days to visit their old friends and are scheduled to leave for the United States on August 2nd. Dr. Anderson has been leading a tour group to China every year since he left Shanghai in 1931. Yesterday, Dr. Anderson told a reporter from the Continental News that the sentiment in Western America is that the Japanese occupation of the Northeast is a fait accompli, but everyone is angry and dissatisfied with the activities of the Japanese in North China. At the same time, they admire the stability of China's internal situation. Americans are now greatly concerned about Chinese affairs. Dr. Anderson is familiar with Far Eastern affairs and gives 30 to 40 lectures on Far Eastern issues in the United States every year.

<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Ban the Transport of Dry Cocoons, Causing Panic in Shanghai Silk Factories</h3>
<p>The Silk Factory Industry Association Holds a Meeting Yesterday; Decides to Request the Authorities of the Two Provinces to Lift the Ban</p>
<p>Since the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces banned the exit of dry cocoons ordered by various silk factories in Shanghai from the provinces, various silk factories in this city are very panicked. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association and the silk industry unions of the Fourth and Sixth Districts held a joint meeting to negotiate a request to the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to lift the ban, and the Hezhai and Yuanchang factories in Zhabei were shut down due to the exhaustion of raw materials. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Stock Only for Two Weeks</p>
<p>The raw materials of various silk factories in this city are all supplied by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The daily demand for dry cocoons is about 600 loads, and although the current stock of dry cocoons in this city varies from factory to factory, the average estimate is only enough for two weeks. Therefore, once Jiangsu and Zhejiang ban the transport of dry cocoons to Shanghai, it will be difficult for various silk factories in this city to last.</p>
<p>Ineffective Negotiation to Prohibit Loading and Transport</p>
<p>According to the statistics, there are the largest number of silk factories in the Zhabei District and Xinzha Road. The total number of silk factories in the city is 44, with about 10,484 silk reeling machines and about 10,000 workers. Since Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces banned the exit of dry cocoons, various silk factories in this city have been extremely panicked. It is also heard that the dry cocoons ordered by a silk factory in Wuxi have also been prohibited from loading and transporting by the authorities of Jiangsu Province. Although negotiations have been conducted, they have not been effective.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Ban in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces</p>
<p>The reasons for the ban on exit from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this time are: First, the output of dry cocoons in the two provinces this year is not large. Whether it is sufficient for the silk factories in the two provinces needs to be investigated in detail before it can be known. In the future, if there is a surplus, it will be allowed to exit. Second, in the past, dry cocoons transported to Shanghai were often resold for export, resulting in a decreasing stock of dry cocoons in the country. In order to maintain the country's silk industry and adjust the domestic supply of silk cocoons, the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have temporarily banned their exit.</p>
<p>Impact: Two Factories Stop Production</p>
<p>It is heard that the Hezhai and Yuanchang silk factories of Gujiawan, Hengbang Road, Zhabei, have little stock. Since Jiangsu and Zhejiang banned the export of cocoons, the source has been cut off. Therefore, they will stop production today. The factory has about 500 workers.

<h3>Fulunheng Silk Factory Labor Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>Wage Restoration; Resumption of Work Yesterday</p>
<p>The Fulunheng Double Palace Silk Factory at the end of Tianbao Road, Hongkou, has been open for many years. The manager, Shen Shunpei, has been doing well in recent years. The factory employs more than 300 female workers. Because they requested the restoration of their original wages and the increase of workshop equipment, which was not accepted by the factory, all the workers refused to enter the factory on the 1st of this month, announcing a strike. They reported to the Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union and requested that personnel be sent to negotiate. The standing directors of the union, Chen Xiupu and Yang Hongmei, based on the wishes of the workers, made a request to Manager Shen of the factory. After several negotiations, a resolution was reached the other day. The resolution was: (1) The wages of female workers in the first-class workshop will be restored to 47 cents starting from June, and the rest will be done by analogy. (2) Hot water tap equipment will be added to the workshop as needed. (3) Work will be resumed uniformly on the morning of July 23. After the above items were agreed upon by both parties, Chen Xiujin, Yang Hongmei, He Bin, Qu Jimin, and others were sent by the union to lead all the female workers to enter the factory for work resumption uniformly at 5:00 AM today (the 23rd).</p>

<h3>Tianjin Stocks of the State-Run China Merchants Bureau are Safe</h3>
<p>It has been said that more than 300,000 bags of flour stored in the Tanggu warehouse of the State-Run China Merchants Bureau have been forcibly seized by the Japanese army. According to the person in charge of the bureau, all the flour in the Tianjin bureau's Tanggu warehouse has been transported to Tianjin and is safe. This is specifically recorded.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Ocean Transportation</h3>
<p>Current Tonnage of Ships Exceeds Demand</p>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry, the increase in world sea freight rates has become a universally acknowledged fact. However, according to the London Shipping Association, the current increase is not enough to offset the expenses of sea transportation. The Association's report last year stated that although the activities of the world's shipping industry are sufficient to offset the needs of tonnage, and sea freight rates have almost reached the standard of 1929, the costs of sailing and construction have continued to increase. Therefore, all shipping companies are suffering from irreparable depreciation and expenses. It further proves that the price index from July 1936 to January 1937 shows that ocean freight rates increased by an average of 58%. However, this increase is only half of that in 1920. The recent surge in the steel market is the main reason for the increase in sea freight rates. Because the demand for steel in countries such as Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, and Japan is endless, even in the summer months, there have long been concerns about the supply of steel, and the price has soared. The cost of ships, which use steel as their bones, has also increased exponentially. Even scrap steel has encountered the same impact. However, on the one hand, China's current tonnage is insufficient, and shipping companies have long been concerned about the difficulty of supplying enough ships. Recently, many ships have moved their business elsewhere in order to obtain higher profits, and the remaining ships are even more insufficient to meet the needs of freight transport. In summary, those who lease ships are the luckiest and most profitable.</p>
<h3>Yichang Water Level Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>48 Feet, 5 Inches</p>
<p>According to a report received by Jianghai Customs yesterday, the water level in Yichang rose from 48 feet and length inches the day before to 49 feet and 3 inches, approaching 50 feet, and the rising trend has not stopped. There is a tendency to break the highest record of 1933, which is extremely worrying. As for the lower reaches of Bai Hankou and below, the water level is still unstable.</p>
<h3>Ch'u Min-i and Others Organize Hsün Society General Assembly Scheduled</h3>

<h3>Student Circles Grieved by National Crisis Launch Propaganda Movement</h3>
<p>Six Propaganda Guidelines Established</p>
<p>Since the situation in North China has become critical, student circles in this city, grieved by the national crisis, plan to expand the propaganda against buying and selling smuggled goods to awaken citizens to resist foreign aggression and defend against the enemy. They are currently requesting the approval of the Anti-Smuggling Association. The established propaganda guidelines are as follows: ㊀ Smuggling undermines our national industry and commerce, weakens our national strength, and reduces our ability to resist the enemy. On the other hand, smuggling strengthens Japan's aggressive power. ㊁ Smuggling is Japan's economic aggression, while armed invasion is Japan's military aggression. We should resist Japan's military aggression while also reducing Japan's economic aggression. ㊂ To reduce smuggling, we must rely on the public not to buy or sell smuggled goods. On the other hand, we must also defend our territory by force and strictly enforce armed anti-smuggling measures. ㊃ North China is now under Japanese military invasion. This is Japan's plan to annex the entire China. We should resolutely resist. Otherwise, North China will become the second Northeast, and the entire China will be in danger. ㊄ Although Japan's military strength is considered strong, if we can unite and resist, we will have a chance of victory. Our people should now prepare all manpower and resources to support the government's resistance against Japan. ㊅ Japan's manpower and resources are delivered from afar to China. As long as the entire country is united and resolutely resists to the end, the final victory will ultimately belong to us.</p>

<h3>Ma Chan-shan Speaks on Thoughts on the Situation in the North</h3>
<p>We must not forget our Northeastern land and compatriots. Now is the time for righteous armies to be active during the green gauze tent season.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Chan-shan, former Northeastern anti-Japanese general and member of the Military Affairs Commission, recently traveled north, staying in Tianjin for a month, and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency specifically visited his residence yesterday to inquire about his observations and thoughts on the situation in the North. According to him, all officers and soldiers of the 29th Army, especially those from the brigade commander level downwards, are determined to fight to the death and are calmly preparing for war. Outside rumors mislead the public, and some misunderstand Chairman Song. Song's resistance against the enemy at Xifengkou created a glorious page in the history of our nation. He is determined and will not have different thoughts. Song once told me that he would follow the orders of the central government in everything and would never succumb to any conditions from the Japanese. He would never make decisions on his own; otherwise, he would be spurned by the people of the country and not be obeyed by his subordinates. Our people love peace. As the saying goes, "We will not offend others unless we are offended." Now is the critical moment of life and death for our nation. All parties should unite, the country should be unified, and all people, young and old, should know that the national crisis has reached this point. There is only one principle: to follow Chairman Chiang's proposal for resistance. We must not forget our Northeastern land and compatriots. The volunteer armies are still constantly going to the front. According to investigations, the total number is about 50,000 to 60,000, or perhaps more. It is now the green gauze tent season, and it is the time for the righteous armies to be active.</p>

<h3>Verdict Concluded on Appeal of Two Criminals in Assassination of Tang Yu-jen</h3>
<p>Both Liu Chen-nan and Ch'iu Chi-yü Recant Their Confessions; Lawyers' Arguments Focus on Physical and Eyewitness Evidence; Sentencing Scheduled for 8:00 AM on the 30th</p>
<p>Tang Yu-jen, former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs from Hunan, was shot and assassinated on December 25th of the 24th year of the Republic at around 5:00 PM in Shanghai. He was riding in his personal car and alighting in front of his private residence at No. 235, 20 Village, Gansdon Road in the French Concession when he was suddenly shot and killed by assailants who fled the scene. Criminals Liu Chen-nan from Hubei and Ch'iu Chi-yü from Shaoxing were successively captured by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau and the Public Concession Police. The French Concession Police took them back for a two-month investigation, which concluded with the Special No. 2 Court's Police Affairs Office filing a public prosecution against them for murder. The Criminal Court President Liao repeatedly conducted court hearings, which concluded with the judgment that both criminals, Liu Chen-nan and Ch'iu Chi-yü, were habitual offenders who committed joint murder and were sentenced to death with permanent deprivation of civil rights. Dissatisfied with the verdict, the criminals presented reasons and hired attorney Hsü Ho-ling as their agent to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. Criminal Court Judge Wang Yüeh held an investigatory hearing and scheduled another hearing. As reported in this newspaper, yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, Criminal Court President Wu T'ing-ch'i of the Third Branch of the High Court, accompanied by Judges Ch'en Ta-ch'i and Wang Yüeh, visited the Criminal Court No. 3 to specially convene an en banc hearing. Prosecutor Tung Ch'i-ming also attended to perform his duties. Attorney Shan Fei-hsi of the Police Affairs Office represented the prosecution. Attorney Hsü Ho-ling, the defense attorney for the appellants, also appeared on time. The court ordered that the appellants Liu and Ch'iu be brought before the court. They were first questioned about their age and reasons for the appeal. Liu Chen-nan testified that he had been arrested and imprisoned for a kidnapping case and was released in April of the year before last. Later, he lived with his parents, wife, and children on Roberts Road. On October 10th of last year, Hsü Tzu-mo came to find me. My father called me to meet Hsü in Zhaofeng Garden. After talking, I sent Hsü to the corner of Jiaozhou Road and was arrested by detectives who came towards me. At the Public Security Bureau, I was tortured with the tiger bench until I fainted twice. When I woke up, they told me that the main criminals who killed Tang Yu-jen, Yang Yu-sheng and Ch'iu Chi-yü, had been arrested in Hong Kong and Shanghai and had confessed that I was also involved in the matter. After saying this, they treated me to a meal and then pressed my fingerprints. All the confessions were written by people inside the Public Security Bureau. I did not understand the contents but was told to confess. Now I have been sentenced to death, which is really unjust. I request justice. I have been to the house of Miss Li, Yang Yu-sheng's mistress. I met her in the 25th year of the Republic. After being released from prison, I asked Yang to introduce me to a job. Yang told me to go to Guangdong with Xiao and stay in the YMCA. After meeting Yang, I returned to Shanghai because there was nothing to do. The four hundred yuan mentioned in the original trial was given by Yang to Xiang Xingchang to cover room and board expenses and was not a reward for us. I do not know who rented the house at No. 233 Gansdon Road. Question: You previously confessed that the house was rented by Yang Yu-sheng and Xiao Pei-wei, that you had lived there for two days, and that it was the base for killing Tang Yu-jen. Why are you denying it now? Answer: The Public Security Bureau told me to say that. Ch'iu Chi-yü then testified that he was released from prison on October 24th of the 24th year of the Republic. He met Yang Yu-sheng in prison. Yang was released from prison before me. A few days after I was released, I met Yang Yu-sheng, Xiao Pei-wei, Xiang Xingchang, Li Lan-ting, and Liu Chen-nan at No. 10, Junyi Lane, Beller Road. Yang told me to go and kill Tang Yu-jen. I refused. He said that in Chinese territory, Liu Luyin could guarantee your safety. I still refused. They prevented me from fleeing. On the 28th of that month, they told me to go to Guangdong. Everything I confessed before was extracted under torture and is all false. I request that Liu Wan, Tang's maid Wang A-mei, the butler in the apartment Hsü Wei-chang, and the gatekeeper Tai Chin-piao be summoned to the case for cross-examination. At this point, the court considered the investigation complete and the facts clear. It then ordered the debate to begin. After the attorney for the Police Affairs Office made his arguments, the defense attorney for the appellants argued that the physical evidence in this case, the shell casings from the shooting and the number of shots fired, had not been studied in detail by the original trial. The witnesses were questioned separately in the original trial. They were very clear that there were three people who shot and killed Tang Yu-jen, but they all said they did not know what the criminals looked like, which is obviously contradictory and unacceptable. To make people confess willingly, it is necessary to summon the witnesses again for cross-examination to provide a basis for the verdict. After the arguments were finished, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled sentencing for 8:00 AM on the 30th. The appellants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Shao Yue-ju Embezzlement Case Arguments Concluded</h3>
<p>Shao Admits to Settlement, But Knows Nothing About the Check</p>
<p>Shao Yue-ju, a shareholder of the Yang Qinghe Jiuji Jewelry Store who had been closed, was recently arrested by the General Police Station for defrauding creditors Shi Yiji, Guo Zhoutao, Kuai Shaoqingzhi, Kang Renchu, and four others of more than 90,000 yuan. He was sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and ordered to post 5,000 yuan bail pending further investigation. As reported in this newspaper yesterday morning, the Special Court continued the interrogation. Attorney Jiang Baolian of the Police Station stated the case. Creditors Guo Zhoutao and Shi Yiji then testified. When questioned, the defendant Shao Yue-ju testified that the Yang Qinghe Jiuji Jewelry Store had a total of 16 shares, each worth 2,500 taels of silver. I had four shares. Later, the jewelry store went bankrupt, and the plaintiffs filed a civil lawsuit. I agreed to compensate them for one-fourth, totaling more than 23,000 yuan. Because I was in Qingdao, my second son, Shao Xiaosong, came forward to reach a settlement. Shao Xiaosong then testified that his father was ill and had gone to Qingdao for recuperation, so I came forward to reach a settlement with the plaintiffs. As a result, a settlement was reached at the law office of Attorney Zhang Shizhao, and 23,000 yuan in cash, one-fourth of the amount, was paid. He therefore held a settlement agreement. He did not know anything about the check or the paper. After mutual arguments between defense attorney Fan Gang and Police Station attorney Jiang Baolian, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the morning of the 28th of this month.</p>

<h3>Woman Becomes Infatuated with Doctor Due to Drug Rehabilitation</h3>
<p>Rents House for Cohabitation; Arrested by Police Station</p>
<p>Wang Shouchen, who currently works for a customs broker, is a wealthy man from Shandong Province. In addition to running a customs brokerage business in Shanghai, he has also invested in the banking sector. Six years ago, he married Li Xiulan (26 years old), the niece of Wang Zhuping, the vice president of Hengli Bank on Tianjin Road, through Wang Zhuping's introduction. They lived together at No. 33, Zhenhua Lane, Malan Road in the French Concession. Wang Shouchen often stayed at his company due to business. Li developed an opium addiction and often made excuses to go out, returning only at dawn. Two months ago, Li's relative Jiang Yunyi was working as an assistant at the venereal disease doctor Zhang Boren's office. Through Jiang's introduction, Li went to Dr. Zhang to quit her addiction. Unexpectedly, she developed an illicit relationship with Zhang. Wang Shouchen had heard about it but had no evidence and was reluctant to make it public to save face. Li even used a large sum of money to help Dr. Zhang open the Yongchun Hospital on Beihai Road. Recently, she rented a house at No. 19, Tongfu Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, as a place for secret rendezvous. Wang Shouchen found out and reported it to the General Police Station. On the 19th, at around 1:00 AM, Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng and Western Detective Tierden rushed to arrest them. Li Xiulan and Zhang Boren were arrested in the house and taken back to the police station. After questioning, because both had fixed addresses, they were not detained but ordered to leave. A report was prepared by the detectives and submitted to the First Special District Court to issue a summons for a hearing on a set date.</p>
<h3>Burglary in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Valued at Ten Thousand Gold Pieces</p>
<p>At 2:00 AM on July 20th, the house of a certain Huang at No. 3, Dagui Lane, Kangjia Bridge, Jessfield Road in Western Shanghai was burglarized. Thieves climbed into the house from the attic and stole items worth more than ten thousand yuan. The items included 4,800 Hong Kong dollars, over 100 Transportation Bank notes, 500 four Hong Kong banknotes each worth 100, the rest banknotes of 100. The Transportation Bank notes were in denominations of ten and five yuan, all stamped with the Dexiang name. In addition, there were also jewelry items worth more than 5,000 yuan, including American Big Two gold coins, small children's gold bracelets, gold butterfly hairpins, jade-inlaid gold rings, American and Hong Kong silver dollars, valuable gold chains, and so on. The owner's family was asleep at the time, which led to the burglary. At around 5:00 AM, they woke up and reported it to the Kangjia Bridge Police Station of the Caojiadu Police Sub-bureau. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division has dispatched officers to investigate in an attempt to solve the case as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Increasing Number of Rickshaw Thefts in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Thieves steal rickshaws near the Zhabei New Bridge, the Xinzha Bridge, and the overhead bridges at the train station, taking advantage of rickshaw pullers who leave their vehicles to pick up passengers.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, We have just received a letter from the Tianjin Fellow Industry Association of Flour and Food Grains in Shanghai, stating that the Shanghai Shin Pao, Shih Shih Hsin Pao and Ta Kung Pao today reported that more than 300,000 bags of flour, worth hundreds of thousands of yuan, had been seized by the Japanese army from the two warehouses of the Tianjin Tanggu Merchants Bureau. We were shocked to read this. After investigating, we found that there were no large quantities of flour stored in Tanggu, and that the Tianjin warehouses were located in the British Concession, so there was no seizure. Furthermore, there was no such thing as the Japanese army forcibly seizing flour. Our fellow industries have daily telegrams and there is no such news. It was also reported that the merchants convened an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss ways to remedy the situation and telegrammed the Hebei-Chahar authorities to request relief, which is even more unfounded. We hereby solemnly declare to your association that we must request that your letter be sent to various newspapers for correction, so as to avoid rumors being spread by unscrupulous people to confuse the public. We sincerely hope that your association will do so. Sincerely, Shanghai Flour Mill Industry Association.</p>
<h3>National Products Manufacturers Association Requests Speedy Establishment of a Special Bureau for the Management of Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Presented to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to Prevent Traitors from Buying Supplies to Aid the Enemy</p>
<p>The China National Products Manufacturers Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry yesterday, requesting unified control of national defense necessities and the establishment of a special management bureau. The original telegram reads: "To the Nanjing Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance, according to reports, there are traitors in this city who, disregarding the national entity, are willing to be exploited, purchasing large quantities of grain and national defense necessities for export to the north, transported from Tianjin and Qinhuangdao to areas outside the customs, to supply the enemy's military needs. The association held a temporary emergency meeting on the 18th to discuss the matter. It was unanimously agreed that Shanghai currently lacks a special bureau to strictly manage the export of national defense necessities, leading these treacherous merchants to use the concessions as a shield, disregarding the overall situation and seeking only private gain. It was decided to submit a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to jointly establish a specialized agency with relevant municipal agencies and organizations to be responsible for management. In addition to the association notifying all member manufacturers to register all types of supplies related to national defense, we hereby submit a telegram to your ministries for review and implementation, which would be in the public interest."</p>

<h3>1937 Wimbledon Tennis Championships (11)</h3>
<p>— Our European Correspondent Lieshan</p>
<p>Day Nine</p>
<p>The matches between Buggy, Kramm, Austin, and Parker, the final four in the men's singles, are the most important events of the day. Many people had predicted that the final would be between Buggy and Kramm, so they didn't seem to pay much attention to the other matches. Although Buggy defeated Parker with a score of 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, the tension of the match far exceeded the expectations of the general public. Buggy actually lost a set, which was a first for him in 1937, and Parker was the first person to do so. Parker played brilliantly today. He is truly the second-best player in America. After watching the match, a British journalist sighed, "Britain will not have any hope of regaining the Davis Cup within ten years!" (Both Buggy and Parker are only twenty-one years old this year.) The next day, a Daily Herald reporter said, "If Parker doesn't win the World Championship within two years, I'll eat my hat!" In short, this was the most exciting match of this year's Wimbledon. The United States has at least a 70-80% chance of winning the Davis Cup this year.</p>
<p>▲ Buggy Defeats Parker</p>
<p>People who have watched Buggy play always have the feeling that no matter how fierce the opponent's skills are, he always has confidence and always has the upper hand. When he plays against ordinary second- or third-rate players, he almost always has a "cat playing with a mouse" attitude. But today he was anxious. This was the first time we saw Buggy looking flustered, and he even changed his racket several times.</p>
<p>After the first set started, Buggy still maintained his usual unhurried attitude. It wasn't until Parker took a 4-2 lead that he realized something was wrong, but it was already too late. Parker not only returned Buggy's most powerful weapon, his cannonball serve, but also his "unparalleled" volleying skills. When the ball reached the opponent's court, it was often saved by Parker, which left Buggy helpless. Parker won the first set 6-2.</p>
<p>In the second set, Buggy's carefree smile disappeared. Although Parker still won two games, taking a 2-0 lead, Buggy then used all his skills and won two games in a row. But Parker did not give in easily. When it was Buggy's turn to serve, he actually won this game again, making the score 3-2. When it was Parker's turn to serve, he cleverly won this game again, making the score 4-2. At this time, the whole audience was cheering for Parker, hoping that something unexpected would happen. If Parker could win two sets in a row against Buggy, who would dare to guarantee that Buggy wouldn't lose the third set? If that really happened, it might become the first miracle in Wimbledon history. However, Buggy was ultimately skilled and bold, and this was also Parker's peak. After that, Buggy returned to normal. After a fierce competition between the two sides, Buggy won four games in a row and won the second set.</p>
<p>In the third set, Buggy again fell behind with a score of 2-3. He still showed his old problem today: his forehand shots often failed to clear the net, but his backhand shots were truly excellent. After several exchanges, he finally took the lead with a score of 5-4. At this time, Parker's momentum was gone, and Buggy won the tenth game, with a score of 6-4, winning the third set.</p>
<p>In the fourth set, Parker already looked tired, but Buggy became more and more courageous. At this time, Buggy was the real Buggy. Parker had no ability to resist his volleying skills. As a result, Buggy won again with a score of 6-1.</p>
<p>▲ Kramm Defeats Austin</p>
<p>In contrast to this match, the match between Kramm and Austin seemed very tense in terms of the score, but it was actually a dull affair. There was a slight competition in the first set, with Kramm winning 8-6. The second set was even more one-sided, and Kramm did not find it difficult to win. There was only a dramatic battle in the third set, but it also became more and more boring. Kramm took a 5-3 lead. Austin, in a helpless state, put up a desperate fight because he was Britain's top player, and it seemed too shameful to lose three sets in a row in front of the British audience. So the score went from 5-5 to 12-12. Kramm seemed to see that Austin's goal was only to win a set and had no other extravagant hopes, so he was a little casual and let Austin win two games in a row, with a score of 14-12. This set took a total of forty minutes. The next day, a British newspaper said that this was a "marathon" tennis match.</p>
<p>In the fourth set, Kramm almost effortlessly won. After a few minutes, he had already won with a score of 6-1, which was not out of the general expectation. The two players in the final this year are Buggy and Kramm.</p>
<p>The men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles have mostly reached the fourth week of the competition. Except for the Australian men's doubles team of Crawford-MacGrath, who were eliminated early, the remaining "main players" have all safely passed. The women's doubles "main players" Mrs. Sporting-Mrs. Yekebushi were defeated today. Considering the strength of the opponent, they were just an ordinary pair of players, and the entire audience sympathized with the fate of these two. As for the elimination results of the mixed doubles, the American team of Buggy-Mrs. Mapu and the French team of Petra-Mrs. Mashu are the strongest, and the American team seems to have a higher chance of winning the championship.</p>

<h3>Overview of Jiangsu Provincial Middle Schools</h3>
<p>Significant Progress in Recent Years</p>
<p>Before the 21st year of the Republic of China, there were more than 20 Jiangsu provincial middle schools because middle schools and normal schools were combined. After Director Zhou Fohai took office, recognizing the need for professional training in normal education and the urgent need to expand vocational education, he abolished the combined middle and normal school system in the autumn of the 21st year and designated eight middle schools, including Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Taicang, Huaiyin, Donghai, Rugao, Suzhou Girls' Middle School, and Xuzhou Girls' Middle School, to specialize in normal schools. In the following year, Suqian, Yancheng, Songjiang, and other middle schools were successively converted into vocational schools with glass and advanced chemistry departments. As of the 25th year, together with the Jiangning Junior Middle School established the previous year and the public Nanjing Middle School, there were a total of 12 middle schools (normal schools, rural normal schools, and vocational schools are not included). Among them, Shanghai Middle School, Yangzhou Middle School, Suzhou Middle School, and Zhenjiang Middle School had more grades and larger scales. Zheng Tonghe, the principal of Shanghai Middle School, Zhou Houhushu of Yangzhou Middle School, and Jiang Zhuzhu of Songjiang Girls' Middle School have served the longest, for more than ten years. In terms of the "area" of each school site, Zhenjiang Middle School covers 850 acres, followed by Shanghai Middle School with 450 acres, Yangzhou Middle School with 260 acres, Suzhou Middle School with 152 acres, Jiangning Junior Middle School with 100 acres, Xuzhou Middle School with 90 acres, Changzhou Middle School with 56 acres, Nanjing Middle School with 37 acres, Nantong and Huaian each with 35 acres, and Songjiang Girls' Middle School with 30 acres, with Nanjing Girls' Middle School's 20 acres being the smallest. The school has already purchased 80 acres of the Sheshan base in Hanxi, Nanjing, to build a new school. In terms of "students," Shanghai Middle School has 26 grades with 1,295 students, Yangzhou Middle School has 23 grades with 952 students, Zhenjiang Middle School has 21 grades with 951 students, Suzhou Middle School has 11 grades with 937 students, Nanjing Girls' Middle School has 14 grades with 559 students, Nanjing Middle School has 11 grades with 648 students, Nantong Middle School has 12 grades with 511 students, Xuzhou Middle School has 11 grades with 480 students, Changzhou Middle School has 10 grades with 334 students, Songjiang Girls' Middle School has 10 grades with 396 students, Huaian Middle School has 9 grades with 388 students, and Jiangning Junior Middle School has 5 grades with 193 students. In terms of "faculty," Shanghai Middle School has the most with 102 people, followed by Yangzhou Middle School with 99 people, Suzhou Middle School with 92 people, Zhenjiang Middle School with 77 people, Nanjing Girls' Middle School with 52 people, Xuzhou and Tongzhou each with 45 people, Huaian Middle School with 41 people, Changzhou and Nanjing each with 35 people, Songjiang Girls' Middle School with 34 people, and Jiangning Junior Middle School with 25 people. The regular expenses of each school in the 25th year were 149,819 yuan, Yangzhou Middle School 134,836 yuan, Suzhou Middle School 126,099 yuan, Zhenjiang Middle School 116,504 yuan, Nanjing Girls' Middle School 65,517 yuan, Xuzhou Middle School 62,423 yuan, Tongzhou Middle School 61,738 yuan, Changzhou Middle School 51,892 yuan, Huaian Middle School 48,751 yuan, Songjiang Girls' Middle School 47,831 yuan, Jiangning Junior Middle School 30,000 yuan, and Nanjing Middle School 44,850 yuan. (Explanation) There are only two girls' middle schools, but all schools except Changzhou Middle School are co-educational. The large expenses of Shanghai, Yangzhou, and Suzhou Middle Schools include vocational education equipment expansion costs. Because of historical reasons, the three schools also offer science, engineering, commerce, civil engineering, and chemical engineering departments. In addition, all the subjects offered by other schools are ordinary subjects, divided into senior and junior high school departments (Jiangning Middle School will add a senior high school department in the next year), mostly double-track, three-track, and single-track. Nanjing was originally a public school, but it received a lot of provincial subsidies. It is the oldest school among the middle schools in Jiangsu Province.</p>

<h3>Shanhai Industrial School Group Goes to Annam as Little Teachers</h3>
<p>Hoping Annam Youth Overseas Students Return to the Country</p>
<p>Annam overseas Chinese Shen Jinquan and Lin Lichen returned to China two years ago and entered the Shanhai Industrial School in this port as Little Teacher researchers. They have now completed their studies. Except for Lin Lichen, who is still staying in Shanghai to continue his studies, Shen Jinquan took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haili wheel to Hong Kong last night and transferred to Saigon. According to Shen's departure statement to reporters, "I am now nineteen years old and Lin is sixteen years old. Because we were isolated from Chinese culture in Annam, we returned to China some time ago, hoping to bring what we have learned in China back to Annam and pass it on to our compatriots. Therefore, we studied at Shanhai Industrial School. I am determined to be a Chinese Little Teacher in Vietnam because the people in Annam are relatively insensitive and there are not many young people who are advancing. If our overseas Chinese want to develop academically, returning to the motherland is the best way. Therefore, I hope that all young students traveling to Vietnam can return to China to study."</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Public Bonds Rebound with Short Covering and Arbitrage: Prices Surge by 2.6 to 4 Yuan, Aided by Collateral</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a surge in short covering, long positions, and arbitrage trading in public bonds. The flourishing scene of the past has reappeared, demonstrating the confidence of bondholders. However, a certain bank was furious because the interest rate for spot market of Type Wu bonds was even higher. Therefore, there was a rumor that public bonds could be used as collateral at 80% of the market price with a monthly interest rate of 6%, with no limit on the amount of collateral accepted. As a result, in the first and second sessions, the spot market of Type Wu bonds was heavily traded. This shows that some financiers are blindly speculating and neglecting legitimate speculation. At the opening yesterday, there was more arbitrage trading in No. 6 and No. 43. No. 5, 18, 37, 50, and 54, etc., were bought, while No. 10, 35, and 44, etc., were still sold. The market price averaged 2.6 to 2.8 yuan higher. In the second session, Type Wu bonds for this month surged 1.35 yuan due to swap relationships. The price of Type Ding bonds for this month also rose slightly by 0.05 yuan. From the forward market, the price continued to rise, becoming stronger later. Type Jia bonds for this month also rose 2.45 yuan. The bullish sentiment among the speculators gradually intensified, but the excessive surge was slightly concerning. As a result, the market price rose by 2.6 to 4.05 yuan. No. 96 also rose by more than 1 yuan. The total trading volume was 31.1 million yuan. The results of the price changes are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>U.S. Stock Market Demand Remains Good</p>
<p>Although there was profit-taking in the New York stock market yesterday, most of the demand remained good. If there are no particularly adverse developments, the market conditions should rise even higher soon.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Chinese Yarn Higher Than Foreign Yarn by More Than 10 Yuan, Marked Yarn Continues to Rise</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to soar, thanks to a good atmosphere and rising securities prices. Sales of spot yarn are improving, and foreign yarn prices are also rising. The Sichuan merchants have strong purchasing power, and warehouse stocks of yarn are shrinking daily, leading to market confidence. However, the current market price of yarn has reached a high level, with the price of 20-count yarn reaching 282-283 yuan, more than 10 yuan higher than foreign yarn. Moreover, various parties are continuously purchasing large quantities, and the excitement is slightly cooling down.</p>
<p>Nearby and Forward Contracts Rise Again by About 2 Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market, contracts for all months continued to rise. Market sentiment was lively, and spot yarn business was also doing well with strong buying interest. Contracts for this month surged 3.6 yuan, while forward contracts rose 1.1-1.4 yuan. After the second session, it was heard that public bonds had also risen, making the market even more stable. However, some people were unwilling to speculate due to the increasing banditry, so trading felt especially quiet. By the time the market closed, it was weak and fell back slightly. As a result, contracts for all months rose by 1.1 to 2.5 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. Sold: Tongxing 200 bales, Yiji 200 bales, Yuanda 200 bales, Hexing 250 bales, Ruida 950 bales, Shenda 350 bales, Shenji 350 bales, Guda 350 bales, Shengyuan 650 bales, Tonghe 200 bales, Xincheng 600 bales. Bought: Dafu 650 bales, Chengji 300 bales, Dafeng 1000 bales, Taixing 350 bales, Xingchang 500 bales, Renfeng 350 bales, Jiankang 900 bales, Xinhua 1150 bales. The highest and lowest prices for half a day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Still Decent</p>
<p>Yesterday, various merchant groups purchased a total of 1335 bales of spot yarn, with prices rising by 1-2 yuan. The purchase amounts for each group are listed below.</p>
<p>Cotton Expected to Rise but Instead Falls</p>
<p>The cotton market initially rose but then retreated, with the trend remaining normal. Old cotton is not needed due to the lack of demand from cotton mills. As for the domestic production of new cotton, the current weather conditions are favorable. Overseas, U.S. cotton is steadily declining. Therefore, although the yarn market is gradually rising, the cotton market is moving in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>August Old Cotton Falls Another 0.6 Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton market, most people believed that the environment would improve and the yarn market would rise again, so short sellers began to cover their positions, and the market continued to advance. August contracts rose 0.5 yuan, but the forward contracts for new cotton felt increasingly weak. However, after entering the market, it was heard that U.S. cotton and Indian cotton were both adjusted, and the market returned to a sluggish path. The price of August old cotton fell again, and new cotton production entered a whirlpool. As a result, August contracts fell 0.6 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, and the remaining contracts fell 0.15 yuan, except for December contracts, which rose 0.05 yuan. Sold: Tongxing 1100 dan, Dafeng 1000 dan, Yuanda 1000 dan, Senkang 1100 dan, Tongfeng 800 dan, Fukang 700 dan, Tonghe 700 dan, Shenchang 700 dan, Ruida 700 dan. Bought: Dafu 3900 dan, Yuanyi 1700 dan, Jinghua 1000 dan, Xincheng 3300 dan, Yikang 800 dan, Xinxing 800 dan. The highest and lowest prices for half a day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Japanese Factories Actively Purchasing Cotton</p>
<p>For spot cotton consumption, Japanese factories are gradually becoming more active in purchasing. However, Chinese merchants have no interest, mainly because the recent sales of spot cotton yarn are not weak, and the local cotton futures market has stabilized, boosting confidence. Therefore, Japanese merchants purchased 1000 bales of new cotton, for a total transaction volume of more than 2000 bales. 84 bales of Yao cotton arrived at the wharf.</p>
<p>Qinghan Yarn Prices Also Quickly Rebound</p>
<p>▲ Osaka: August 23rd Osaka Telegram: Spot yarn fell 1 yuan. 16-count fan surface 235 yuan, 40-count five-star 350 yuan, 42-count pheasant 365 yuan, all unchanged. 20-count goldfish 254 yuan, fell 1 yuan. Three-product futures yarn rose 0.5 to 2.6 yuan, near-term 258.9 yuan, far-term 243.9 yuan. Also, cotton futures fell 0.15 to 0.3 yuan, near-term 72.7 yuan, far-term 74.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Favorable Weather Reports, U.S., British, and Indian Cotton All Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with favorable weather and smooth cotton harvesting in the South, especially in Vicksburg. At the same time, there was a lack of buying stimulus. Contracts for all months fell 2-4 points. Initially, local merchants bought, and there was a rebound, but unfortunately, no one followed up, and foreign merchants and New Orleans began to sell off, and the market became sluggish again. Weather forecasts indicated good weather in the East, cloudy and rainy conditions in the Central region, and cloudy conditions in parts of the West, except for Oklahoma. At the close, short positions were covered, and the market tightened. Spot prices fell 3 points, and futures prices ranged from unchanged to down 5 points. British spot cotton fell 3 points, and futures fell 4-5 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by European exporters and short covering, but later retreated due to beneficial rain in parts of the Central Provinces. Nagpur rose 0.75 rupees, Oomra fell 2 rupees, and Berar fell 0.75-1 rupee. Original telegram recorded on the left (August 22nd telegram).</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Activity in Local Cotton Cloth Strengthens</p>
<p>Yesterday, the piece goods market saw a positive trend for white fabrics. Spot goods of popular brands like Dongpi's thin cloth, Gaodang's leading brand, and Wufu, etc., were scarce. Dye factories continued to increase their demand for blue cloth from the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. As a result, purchasing was strong. The yarn market gradually rebounded, and confidence was strengthened. The market price rose another 5 cents per piece. Total transaction volume for the day was 500-600 pieces. Foreign firms opened a few hundred pieces of recent-production Labatong thin cloth and thin twill. Business in Dongpi's department store goods consistently declined, while the activity in local cloth strengthened. The Guangdong merchants continued to add 400-plus pieces of thin twill and coarse cloth from factories in Shanghai and Changzhou, and 100-plus pieces of thin cloth. The Changsha merchants were handling 60-70 pieces of thin cloth and thin twill. The Jiangxi merchants had already left Shanghai, and new goods were slowly arriving. The purchased goods were being packed and shipped daily. Inland wholesale in this street tightened credit, and the market became even more stagnant. Business in the retail stores was even more deserted.</p>
<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Hedge Again Lowers, Marked Gold Still Flat</p>
<p>The gold market was still stable yesterday after being weak. The gold hedge continued to drop to 1180 yuan. In the morning, London spot gold fell another 1.5 pence. The central bank announced that the exchange rates for British and American currencies were flat, and the customs gold unit shrank by 0.02 yuan. The standard marked gold price fell further to 1134.7 yuan. The opening price in the morning fell to 1141.5 yuan. Yifeng, Yongyu, and Xinxiang were all actively buying. Although Jingfuxiang and Wanxing were supplying, the price at noon still rose to 2.5 yuan, the same as the previous close, about 8 yuan higher than the settlement price. The gold hedge fell to 1180 yuan. Shengyuan and Yong sold 70 taels to the Hankou merchants. Later, Dafeng, Hengtai, and Kangrun sold to the silver shop merchants at 1178 yuan. Swaps were quoted by Dacheng at 28 strips for Yifengyong at 3.3 yuan. There were 630 August strips remaining. The total number of September chips was 868 strips, totaling 14 long positions and 9 short positions. Total trading volume for half a day was 63 strips.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Swaps Show Minor Differences</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market initially showed the London Cable near flat, with the far contract shrinking by 0.0625. The New York silver market remained flat. The British pound shrank by 0.012 yuan against the U.S. dollar, and was flat against the French franc and Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar rose by 0.01625 against the French franc and fell by 0.01 yuan against the Japanese yen. The opening selling price for the near contract was the same as the previous close, but the far contract was firmer, and the swap differences were minimal. After the opening, the HSBC rate remained flat. The near contract had been hardening. Banks were trying to sell off, while foreign firms and Huayi were buying, but the situation was stiff. However, the Japanese exchange rate was stable. In the future, foreign firms will continue to buy U.S. dollars, while overseas firms will sell off. Sassoon tried to boost the U.S. dollar swap, but there were many bids. At the close, the selling price for the near contract was 1 shilling and 2.25 pence for the British pound, and 29.5625 yuan for the U.S. dollar, which was still flat compared to the previous close, but there was still a possibility of further easing. Both foreign firms and Chinese merchants were buying.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British pound was bought by McGalliard for the August contract at 0.25, and the same month was sold at 0.21875. Huayi sold the spot contract at 0.25 and 0.28125.

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Rumors of Export Bans in Hunan Province, Xiang Glutinous Rice Prices Soar by About 0.2 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot sales of Xiang glutinous rice were active both in the North and South. In the South, Xiamen, in addition to Shantou, was actively buying. In the North, there was also outflow from Jijiang. Arrivals of coarse rice had not been strong recently, while demand within the local market remained strong. It was rumored that the local government in Hunan Province had banned exports, leading to a unified upward trend in sentiment both locally and abroad. Production areas also sent messages saying they would slow down sales. Market prices immediately jumped up 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Total offerings for the day included 7566 bags of Gan rice, 4920 bags of Xiang rice, and 850 bags of coarse Sha-Han rice. Although reports of lower prices for foreign wheat were seen, continued orders were not made due to unprofitable transportation.</p>
<p>Bai Geng and Bo Dao Reduced Prices to Sell</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, nearly 30 sources from various merchant groups supplied a total of 6200-6300 shi of goods. The local sales market turned sluggish after the forenoon, so market conditions became weak. Fortunately, there were not many arrivals. As a result, the price of slightly thicker early Geng rice depreciated slightly by a few cents to about 0.1 yuan, and the price of Bo Dao rice fell by 0.1 yuan. Du Yang and Jian Dai were weak, while Yin Bian Yuan was mediocre.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were few arrivals of boats from various merchant groups downstream, about 20 boats. At the opening in the morning, trading was exceptionally quiet, causing prices to fall back by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Later, because of the small price cuts, merchants slightly bought up the particularly Bai Geng rice, bringing the price back up by about 0.1 yuan. Lower and middle-grade rice fell by about 0.2 yuan. Bo Dao was scarce, so merchants' appetite was still acceptable, and prices were strong. Du Jian was weak, and Bai Yuan was stable. Other goods were also weak.</p>
<p>New Yellow Soybeans Increased, Lowered Again</p>
<p>▲ Soybean Cake Sales Market Still Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the new yellow soybean market showed mixed signals. Due to uneven arrivals and sales, the trend was to increase prices first, then lower them again. At the opening, there were over 200 bags of Chengmen beans. The price of Jiangqiao beans fell 0.03-0.04 yuan, while prices of Sanyang beans fell 0.08-0.09 yuan. Over 280 bags of Duchang beans were traded for the first time, with prices ranging from 6.05 to 5.9 yuan. The Yamabento street dealers bought them. The market for soybean cake remained active, with over 22,000 pieces of current and forward soybean cake traded. Prices continued to rise by 0.01 yuan, which helped stabilize the old soybean market. Oil extraction plants were also actively buying. Yesterday, the pure market traded over 500 bags of various soybeans.</p>
<p>Wheat Flour Still Without New Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat flour market only settled transactions for the day, without any new developments. Due to practical difficulties, the market was even more quiet. As for the ban on wheat flour exports, a solution has been determined. Those who are not suspected of aiding the enemy will be permitted exports with certification from the municipal chamber of commerce and trade associations. If the ban continues to be rigidly enforced, it will not only affect the social economy, but also the working class. Regarding wheat, because wheat flour will soon be able to circulate, merchants and factories have had discussions. However, factories want to lower prices slightly, while merchants want to raise them, so they have not reached an agreement, resulting in no transactions. A new agreement may be reached next week.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>Tung Oil Arrivals Are Scarce, Signs of Turnaround, Domestic Inventory Still Very Abundant</p>
<p>The white tung oil market has been in decline since the beginning of summer. The main destination for foreign firms is the United States. It is now reported that the United States has an inventory of over 30,000 tons, which can supply their needs for 5-6 months at a consumption rate of 5-6,000 tons per month. Therefore, exports from our country have not been enthusiastic in the last month or two. The lowest price in the Hankou market is only 45-46 yuan per dan, including tax. Recently, due to the scarcity of arrivals, there has been a slight turnaround. According to last night's Hankou telegram, the price has risen to 50.34 yuan. However, a detailed investigation reveals that the inventory in various producing areas is abundant, so although there may be a temporary upturn, it will be difficult to sustain. Although there are still 3-4 months before the new production season, the national inventory is estimated to be 600,000 dan, which is significantly higher than in previous years. Therefore, the future market is expected to be long-term weak and short-term volatile. This port relies on Zhejiang tung oil for supply. Since the recent suspension of freight trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway, arrivals in Shanghai have been cut off, and the market is quite scarce. Measures are now being taken to transport by waterway, and arrivals have slightly increased, but the transportation time has been extended and freight costs have increased, so each shi needs to be around 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods</h3>
<p>New Almonds Sell Most Actively to Guangdong</p>
<p>The almond harvest is very abundant this year, and the market was expected to decline, but due to the sudden changes in the situation, transportation in Pinglü countryside has been significantly blocked, which has prevented the market from being flooded with supply. Yesterday, Xishan Baiyu Biang almonds opened at 140 yuan, medium-grade at 132 yuan, Beishan almonds at 110 yuan, Zhangfang Xing almonds at 110 yuan, Yunjun Kuangyou at 104 yuan, Jiudaomei at 72 yuan, and medium-grade almonds at 68 yuan. Recently, purchases have been most concentrated in Guangzhou, followed by foreign firms and pharmacies. Local retail is also very active, and market conditions are stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Chinese and French Silk Prices Gradually Approaching ▲ French Companies Made Inquiries Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market became more stable, and silk prices in Japan and the United States also rose (New York near-term up 2 cents, far-term up 1 cent, Yokohama spot up 5 yuan, far-term up 15 yuan). Local users were more active in purchasing, and speculators also increased their buying activity. The offered prices generally rose by more than 10 yuan. Foreign firms made inquiries. It is rumored that White Factory B-grade silk with no uniformity of 20-22 strands was sold for 790 yuan, but this has not been confirmed. If this news is confirmed, the Chinese and French market prices would be very close, and the European silk market, which has been holding back for a long time, should be able to expand. Yesterday, 70 dan were traded in the local market and 20 dan in the Indian market.</p>
<p>Report on Raw Silk Exports for the First Half of the Month</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, the domestic rising trend was strong, and foreign sales decreased significantly due to the large difference in silk prices. According to the Commodity Inspection Bureau, 798 dan were exported to Europe, 485 dan to the United States, and 110 dan to Asian and African ports, for a total of 1393 dan. The total exports for the past one and a half months were 3267 dan, a decrease of 1389 dan compared to the same period last year. Silk prices have risen significantly. The export volume and silk price comparisons for this period are listed below for reference.</p>
<p>Black and Green Tea are Both Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market was even firmer. Black tea from Qimen, Fuliang, and other areas continued to be sold, and the overall market sentiment was upward. Prices rose by 1-2 yuan. Qimen floral tea, sold over 1000 boxes to Russian firms, and the offering price was 33-34 yuan. The market was not deserted either. Both Lufang and Tuzhuang Zhenmei teas saw slightly stronger trading. Jinlong, Xiehe, and other firms purchased quite a bit, and market prices have been trending upward. Among them, the fine needle eyebrow item was particularly popular.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Some Transactions in Coarse Granulated and White Sugar</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat. The guild's quoted price for 24 coarse granulated white spot sugar was 24.5 yuan, and for re-export goods, 9.1 yuan. There were some transactions. East White 4 was 24.15 yuan, re-export goods 9.1 yuan, 8 was 23.9 yuan, re-export goods 8.9 yuan. SH marked spot goods were 23.8 yuan, re-export TM marked goods 8.75 yuan, but there were no transactions. Numbered goods were also lacking in offerings.</p>
<p>The sugar industry's joint venture held a bid yesterday for a total of 3700 bags. Shunde Factory 1500 bags, price 24.15 yuan, no transaction. Xinshi Factory 2000 bags, 806 bags sold, Dongguan Factory 200 bags, 20 bags sold, price 24.1 yuan. Xinshi Factory sold 806 bags, the firm exchanged Dutch re-export goods, price 9.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>New Lead Wire Sales are Active</p>
<p>Sales of new lead wire have been exceptionally good recently, due to purchases by the Central Trust Bureau and Yamamoto Arsenal. It is heard that over 10,000 dan were offered yesterday, causing a shortage in the market. Standard prices have been rising frequently. Coarse-grade Western goods opened at 14 yuan, Chinese goods at 13.5 yuan, and Japanese goods at 12.75 yuan. Medium-grade Western goods opened at 13.25 yuan, and Chinese and Japanese goods opened at 13 yuan. Fine-grade Western goods opened at 15 yuan.</p>

<h3>Forbidden Books, Poetry</h3>
<p>— Wu Cun</p>
<p>July 22, 26th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1937], the newspaper reported that negotiations for the Lugou Bridge Incident had concluded. Our side, in accordance with the agreement, withdrew troops, while the Japanese side increased the transport of military supplies. "Peace" was hoped for, yet the entire nation grieved.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao reported on the 23rd, a telegram from Tianjin:</p>
<p>Since the 18th, Japanese troops have been stationed at the Tianjin Post Office to inspect mail. The post office has reported this to the central and local authorities separately. After repeated negotiations with the Japanese military by the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, Li Wentian, understanding has been reached with Hashimoto and Fujii. On the afternoon of the 22nd, the Japanese personnel stationed at the post office to inspect mail were ordered to withdraw and no longer inspect. On the same day, the News reported a telegram from Peiping [Beijing]:</p>
<p>The Supervisory Office recently investigated and banned the sale of a large number of publications in bookstores within the city, including The Voice of North China, Northeast Knowledge, Anti-Japanese Frontline, Anti-Japanese General, Anti-Enemy Life, International Knowledge, The People's Road, Patriotic Anthology, Reading Life, Chinese, The Voice of China, Sanmin Monthly, Guilin Monthly, etc., more than sixty titles in all. The police bureau has been ordered to prohibit their sale.</p>
<p>“You give me a peach, I will repay you with jade.” Since you have agreed to stop inspecting mail, and have received our "understanding," we will certainly strictly prohibit the sale of publications, to show "friendship." You don't inspect, I will ban. "It is not retaliation, but will forever be good." We are originally of the same language and culture, two extremely loving "major nations of East Asia"!</p>
<p>Such a grand event, how can it not be recorded! — The poem says:</p>
<p>Bloodstains fresh by Lugou Bridge,</p>
<p>Laughter and talk fill the cultured city.</p>
<p>Who says opening the door invites the thief?</p>
<p>Our generals dearly love peace.</p>
<p>The Supervisory Office submits its imperial ban,</p>
<p>Innocent books and newspapers bitterly sink.</p>
<p>A storm rages through the literary city,</p>
<p>A heart of reciprocating gifts.</p>
<p>Don't say the divine land sinks,</p>
<p>The Chinese land is devoid of ethics.</p>
<p>Only pity the moon over the Wu-ting River,</p>
<p>Forever shining on the souls of warriors!</p>
<h3>Do Not Discuss National Affairs</h3>
<p>— Jia Qian</p>
<p>There was a time when public places had a "Do Not Discuss National Affairs" rule, the reason for which is unknown and bewildering! Perhaps it is like what the new lyricist said, "National affairs are none of your business, just play mahjong." But, can "national affairs" really be "none of your business"? That is not necessarily the case. Even if "China is so disappointing, so people dare not speak their minds," (see Zeng Jinke's "Reply to a Young Man's Letter"), if a citizen "talks" about "national affairs," whether with reason or without, it should not be considered a crime, right? However, because "national affairs cannot be managed, so we can only not manage them," thus putting "profound pain in this sentence (i.e., 'play mahjong') to vent the bitterness of the time" (Reply to a Young Man's Letter) as a reason for "Do Not Discuss National Affairs," which I think is inappropriate.</p>
<p>At this time, on the eve of a storm, young people all feel bewildered and bitter, but the new lyricist also heard people shouting various slogans at that time. Slogans may not necessarily be put into practice, but it is possible to see many young people finding a way out in their bewilderment and bitterness from these slogans. The government has also made a clear statement about "opening up freedom of speech." Then, in addition to being disappointing, China should not make people afraid to speak their minds!</p>
<p>Looking at the enthusiastic public sentiment after the Lugouqiao Incident, everyone can "talk" about "national affairs." If, because of bitterness, you gather four people to fill a table and "play mahjong," I'm afraid amidst the clamor of "blank tiles" and "central wind," you won't realize that "today's Hebei and Chahar will become yesterday's Northeast Four Provinces."</p>
<p>The view of "Do Not Discuss National Affairs" is wrong. There is no need to use excuses such as fearing that illegal elements will take the opportunity to cause trouble. Every citizen has the right to "talk about national affairs," and it is precisely because we want to "talk about national affairs" that it has aroused the interference of the Public Works Department, who believes "we are fish and meat." Yesterday's "Li Bao" reported: "Last night (22nd) at 11 pm, many young people gathered on the grass of the Bund Park, discussing the current situation out of concern. However, as the number of people increased, the police saw this and drove them out of the park. The young people believed that discussing the current situation was a common occurrence, and there was no illegal behavior, so they remained in the park. Seeing this, the police notified the police station to arrest</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>many people. As a result, four young people were arrested and then released."</p>
<p>"The authorities in the concessions have forgotten that their position is that of a concession, and they treat us entirely as a colony." Zhou Jianyun said these painful words at the preparatory meeting for the Shanghai cultural circle's movement to abolish the right of the concessions to censor opera and films. Of course, the concession authorities will not forget that their position is that of a concession. Those who treat us entirely as a colony want us to forget that it is a concession, so movies are not allowed to have maps of the Northeast Four Provinces, and singing salvation songs in the park is considered an "offense." "Being concerned about the current situation and gathering to discuss" is naturally something that those "police officers who eat the emperor's food and repay the emperor's favor" think should result in imprisonment.</p>
<p>In the past, parks in the concessions had signs saying "Dogs and Chinese are not allowed." Now, at least they have paid a one-dollar head tax and can enter and exit freely. But "when you get to the concession, you must forget that you are Chinese!" In the shadows of green vines, by the Han River pond, it is best to have couples together, whispering sweet nothings. Then, even if the number of people "increases," they will drag their batons and quietly avoid you. If you want to sing salvation songs and talk about the current situation, this will inevitably conflict with "treating us entirely as a colony," because their position is still ultimately a "concession."</p>
<p>People are hoping that we "do not discuss national affairs"—this is probably not far from the "policy of keeping the people ignorant." China is so disappointing, but can the common people "just not care"?</p>
<p>We want to "talk about national affairs." At 1 am on the 23rd, our newspaper received an urgent telegram from Beiping: After China and Japan finalized an agreement on the morning of the 21st for both sides to withdraw troops, the Japanese troops in the Dajing Village area, five miles from Lugouqiao, should have withdrawn at the same time. However, as of 6 pm on the 22nd, the Japanese troops showed no signs of withdrawal and increased the number of large and small steel cannons by more than 20. A large amount of poisonous gas was also transported to the area east of Lugouqiao... Who allowed them to "decide" this "final agreement"?</p>

<h3>A Century of History of the Böcking Factory in Tegel, Berlin, Germany</h3>
<p>July 22, 1937, marks the centenary of the most famous Böcking factory in Tegel, Berlin. A grand celebration was held in Berlin, Germany. The founder of the Böcking factory and his descendants' history of founding the factory are listed below:</p>
<p>The factory was founded by Vogt Theodor Böcking, who was born in Weißblau, Germany, in 1804. He first learned carpentry there, and later had the opportunity to work in a foundry and machine factory. Because of his hard work, he was soon promoted to manager. At that time, he was still young and not satisfied with this environment. He gathered all his savings and founded a small-scale machine factory in Berlin in December 1836. The first batch of products made were 16,000 screws. At that time, 50 workers were employed. By mid-1837, a relatively complete machine factory was established. The power required at that time was only driven by two horses, and the furnace used bellows. On July 22, 1837, the first cast iron was produced, and this day was designated by Vogt Theodor Böcking as the anniversary of the factory's founding.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1838, the first steam engine manufactured by the factory was completed. Since then, the manufacturing method has been gradually improved, and products such as looms and sugar-making machines have been produced. Furthermore, steam engines, steam boilers, and water pumps have also begun to be manufactured.</p>
<p>In 1841, the first locomotive was made. Since then, a large number of locomotive orders have been received, making the factory's business prosperous. Vogt Theodor Böcking believed that locomotives would be in great demand, so he worked on improving them and striving for excellence. Before long, this product became the most famous in the world. Later, due to insufficient supply, it was expanded into a large-scale manufacturing factory.</p>
<p>In 1847, steel and iron plates were produced. At this point, Vogt Theodor Böcking was able to fulfill his original ambition of not seeking foreign goods. A year later, he bought another machine factory. When the factory started, Böcking wanted to further develop his business and strive for independence, so he leased coal and iron ore mines upstream of the Schellieser for self-sufficiency. Unfortunately, at this time, he abandoned everything and passed away in 1854.</p>
<p>Albert was the son of Vogt Theodor Böcking. At that time, he was 25 years old. He inherited his father's ambition and engaged in business operations. Later, products such as shipping machinery, railway materials, and ship hulls were produced. During the war from 1870 to 1871, he manufactured military equipment such as mines, torpedoes, and gun carriages. As for the manufacture of locomotives, it had become a world-renowned honor product.</p>
<p>Albert Böcking passed away in 1878. At that time, the number of staff in the Berlin factory and Schellieser was twice that of when his father passed away. Because his sons and descendants, Einar, Ernst, and Carl, were still young, his father Albert authorized the board of directors. However, the directors were afraid of taking responsibility, resulting in a slight decline in the factory's products.</p>
<p>In 1894, the three brothers grew up and took responsibility. The eldest brother, Einar, was in charge of the mining operations upstream of the Schellieser, but he tragically died in a mining accident in 1897.</p>
<p>Ernst and Carl, seeing that the old-fashioned machinery was not very suitable, decided to establish a new factory in Tegel. This factory was prepared in 1896, and production began in 1898. The equipment in the factory was extremely sophisticated and comprehensive, and the products were even more complete, such as refrigerating machines, air gas compressors, and Mammut pumps. Before long, all the equipment for chemical plants and oil presses were also available.</p>
<p>When the European War started from 1914 to 1918, the factory specialized in manufacturing military weapons. After the war, it worked hard to operate, and products such as steam turbine oil presses were produced. However, after the war, the vitality of various countries had not recovered, and sales were stagnant. The domestic railway administration was also unable to purchase new vehicles, so the factory was slightly affected.</p>
<p>By 1930, the Böcking factory had produced 12,000 locomotives. In 1933, it merged with the Lemida factory. Since then, business has been revived, and orders from various countries are crowded. The number of employees is increasing daily, so an engineering office of the Lemida Böcking Machinery Factory was established in China at Room 704, Hamilton Building, Jiangxi Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Stamp Collecting Gossip</h3>
<p>— Chen Jianxia</p>
<p>"Things in the world are valued for their scarcity," this saying is truly an unbreakable maxim. General antique collectors regard rare antiquities, such as Xia cauldrons, Shang burials, Jin calligraphy, and Kang inscriptions, as treasures, worth a fortune. This is the principle.</p>
<p>Stamps, after being used, seem to have become waste. But there are many old stamps in the world that are considered priceless treasures, and people are scrambling to obtain them. Isn't that unbelievable?</p>
<p>The history of stamps in European countries is very long, so there are also many stamp collectors. Their interest in studying stamps far exceeds other antiques. There are stamp dealers who specialize in buying and selling stamps, large companies that organize the circulation of stamps, and special books that study the era, form, value, and identify authenticity. Almost all old stamps are treated like ordinary goods. Each stamp has a certain standard price, and sometimes old stamp exhibitions and on-the-spot auctions are held. Due to the different trends in supply and demand, there are even changes in market prices. Therefore, the purpose of many stamp collectors is not only to love treasures, but also to regard it as a kind of savings that can be used to profit.</p>
<p>China's postal service began during the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty, only about forty years ago. But there are already many famous and valuable old stamps that are well-known. The earliest commonly used stamps only used a square red paper, stamped with a wooden chop with words, which was considered effective. The paper quality was poor, and the handwriting was not very clear. Although there are still remnants, the value is not very expensive. Probably because this kind of old stamp is prone to forgery, it is not valued by general stamp collectors. Among Chinese stamps, the most valuable is a red stamp with small characters meaning one yuan. At that time, this stamp was temporarily issued as a commemoration of Empress Dowager Cixi's birthday. Later, it was abolished because the characters were small and replaced with large characters. There are only a few with small characters, and now each one costs more than 1,500 yuan. In addition, there are also deformed variations such as the large-character one-yuan dragon gate inverted cover, which are all high-priced treasures in national stamps.</p>
<p>In short, any special and rare stamps can be used as rare goods for stamp collectors. I remember eight or nine years ago, when airmail stamps were first issued, during the first three days of the opening of the Beijing-Shanghai airmail route, the post office used red stamps for commemorative purposes. General stamp collectors bought stamps and sent letters like crazy, and even filled an empty letter with airmail stamps of various prices in order to obtain a red stamp as a pleasure. A friend of mine spent about 300 yuan in this battle, and as a result, he got many colorful old stamp envelopes. Those who didn't know it must have laughed at him as crazy. Who knew that before long, a stamp collector from Jiangxi came and offered a price of 80 yuan to exchange for an envelope. The two people's negotiations still recognized each other as very affectionate!</p>
<p>The most famous stamp collector in China is Zhou Jinjue, who is known as the Stamp King among insiders. It is said that all his stamps are worth no less than two or three hundred thousand. He even has four of the above-mentioned small one-yuan red flowers connected together, which can be regarded as a rare treasure among national stamps. No stamp collectors at home and abroad are not envious of it. In the past, Yuan Hanyun, the son of Hongxian, was also a stamp collecting expert, but later, due to economic reasons, there was news that he had transferred his entire stamp collection. I don't know where these stamps are now.</p>
<p>As for the method of stamp collecting, the first condition is certainly inseparable from money. If you have sufficient financial resources, you can freely choose and purchase your favorite boutiques, and after summing them up into a collection, you can immediately have a magnificent view. Secondly, regardless of whether they are new or old stamps, you can try to collect them within the scope of your ability. It is best if a friend is responsible for receiving and sending in a company or organization, and it is easier to entrust them to arrange for it. Accumulating in this way will inevitably lead to various different styles, and then try to exchange them with others, trading what you have for what you don't have. It is not impossible to form a stamp collection in this way.</p>
<p>If the stamp collection is spectacular, you must then demand a formal sophistication. The stamp album must be exquisitely decorated, and each stamp should be surrounded by transparent cellophane, so that it can permanently preserve its color. The gluing procedure should also not be sloppy. Specially made adhesive paper should be used so that you can freely change its position. Such a stamp collection, no matter what its value, must be very magnificent. When you feel inspired, it is fun to take it out and admire it, and its pleasure is no less than that of ancient books and famous paintings. Then collect at any time, and treasure it at any time, you can develop a lasting habit, and you can improve your appreciation of emotions. Especially in terms of valuation, you can assemble the zero into a whole, not only without losing a penny, but perhaps also having considerable benefits. Isn't it several things at once?</p>
<h3>Picturesque Aquarium in Qingdao, A Summer Resort</h3>

<h3>Application of Basic Footwork in Tap Dance</h3>
<p>— Zheng Lio</p>
<p>One of the quintuplet footwork methods - The Four-Cut Note: I have an impression, I remember when I was young, I saw several song and dance groups from Shanghai in a certain place. It was the time when the Li school of singing and music was popular. What I saw was so-called tap dance. The onomatopoeic word, but they wore rubber-soled cloth shoes, and didn't make a single sound, the mechanical jump from side to side, seems not to have disappeared to this day, which shows that the abuse of foreign art will only be a laughing stock. Nowadays, naturally thanks to the influence and driving force of Hollywood dance, China has a foundation for tap dance. However, art has no borders, and is the natural evolution of mankind.</p>
<p>This kind of dance art is called iron-bottom dance in Hong Kong, Macau, and other places, and rapid foot dance in Nanyang, Singapore, Vietnam, etc. When I performed in the capital without a day this year, they made foot sound dance. Now, they usually still use the past terms tap or tap dance, which seems not to be the phonetic translation of the English TAP, DANCE. I think the name suggests, the foot jumps out of sound, the name foot sound dance is extremely consistent, or foot sound dance, and it is more appropriate to translate the meaning of the English.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the four-cut note, because its foot sound needs to be more obvious. Its standard footwork is: ㊀ Lift the left foot forward and use the sole of the foot to land and make the first sound. ㊁ Then the heel lands and makes the second sound, and the body slightly sinks. ㊂ Lift the right foot forward and use the toe of the foot to land and make the third sound. At the same time, the left foot is off the ground and the body moves forward. ㊃ Use the heel of the left foot to land and make the fourth sound, while the right foot is lifted again and the body slightly sinks. Jumping down, you can continue to proceed with the right foot. The footwork is the same as above. The above is a total of four sounds, each estimated to be one beat.</p>
<p>Starting with a quintuplet, the four-cut note is four beats with a total of seven sounds—based on the four-cut note footwork and beats, without the difficulty of a three-section note, that is, first use the left foot to kick out the quintuplet, which represents the ㊀㊁ sound, in which the triplet occupies one beat, and the remaining two sounds occupy one beat, and the body slightly sinks, the remaining ㊂㊃ is the same as the above two beats, adding up to a total of four beats—four-section note foot position diagram:</p>
<h3>Introducing a New Amateur Opera Performer</h3>
<p>— Ruo</p>
<p>The little amateur opera performer is Mr. Hu Fangming's third son, Hu Guorong. He is only nine years old, has a martial air about him and is already familiar with martial arts operas. In the past, I have visited the Shidai Piaofang (Opera Club) run by his father and saw him playing with spears and chanting gongs and drums, running among the guests, and every move was in harmony with the rhythm. I secretly marveled at his extraordinary character. Last spring, the piaofang felt a lack of martial arts actors, so they encouraged his father to let him learn the play "Baisuitan". Within a few months, his skills greatly improved. Later, at his father's 50th birthday celebration, I watched him perform this play. His stance was concise, his spear skills were skillful, and he was not only entering the hall, but also entering the room. As for the beauty of the art that all martial arts plays should have in his demeanor and small movements, it can be said that he is fully equipped. It is said that his father said that this play is on stage. This is the second time, and he has learned more complex plays such as "Bala Temple" and "Lion Tower". He is truly an outstanding talent rising up in the amateur opera world. The picture below is a still from his performance of "Baisuitan" as Mu Yuqi.</p>
<h3>Zhaofeng Garden on a Summer Night</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>In the evening, the summer sunset cast two irregular shadows, swaying as they headed towards Avenue Joffre. The dust and exhaust fumes on the road almost suffocated us. Only when we saw the entrance to Zhaofeng Garden did we breathe a sigh of relief. A feeling of joy and ease filled our heavy hearts.</p>
<p>Stepping into the garden, we felt as though we had entered another world. The tree-lined paths, the lush green trees, and the soft, green grass revealed the vibrancy and beauty of nature. We forgot that we were still in the bustling city and temporarily pushed aside the troubles of life. A beautiful dream vividly unfolded before our eyes.</p>
<p>We followed a secluded path towards the shade in front. The grass and the groves were already dotted with young men and women. Although the setting sun was already behind the mountains, its golden afterglow, along with the red light of the evening glow, still peeked out to take one last look at the dim earth, as if with a touch of lingering affection.</p>
<p>The sun had reluctantly hidden behind the horizon, but it was still early. Therefore, there were not many people in the garden yet. Later, the sky gradually darkened, and the number of people in the garden gradually increased, and many chairs were filled.</p>
<p>The curtain of night quickly advanced into nature. The cool breeze of the summer night crept onto the grass by the river. The lovely moon quietly hid among the treetops, smiling and emitting a gentle light, which poured onto the ground like mercury, piled on the treetops, and flowed on the water surface. I couldn't help but exclaim with excitement.</p>
<p>—Oh, this beautiful world, this mysterious night, eternal god, may you remain in this world forever!</p>
<p>I got up from the chair and lay down on the grass by the river, gazing at the floating white clouds and the twinkling stars in a daze. Mei also sat down beside me on the grass, but she just sat there silently, without a word, as if savoring the beauty of the night.</p>
<p>The weeping willows by the river gently brushed the water's surface. As the breeze passed, the still river water flowed with silver-like ripples. Several lights were reflected on the bottom of the river like electric whips. A girl in a red dress led a group of lively children, launching three or five small sailboats on the river. As the boats sailed further away, we could only vaguely see them swaying with the wind, as if disappearing into the distant misty waves. Suddenly, a flock of ducks quacked and swam past, shaking all the small sailboats on the river. The surrounding area was filled with innocent laughter.</p>
<p>Under the moonlight, in the dimly lit areas, pairs of people sat side by side, talking about their love. Shadows of people were scattered across the green lawn like stars in the sky. The jazz music from the thatched pavilion across the river resonated with people's heartstrings, playing a lively tune.</p>
<p>A burst of melodious piano sound slowly drifted in from a small western-style house outside the garden, accompanied by a kind of sad song. I looked up in that direction and saw a dense grove of trees in one corner of the garden. The exquisite roof was faintly visible within the trees. A faint ray of light shone from the window, reflected on the leaves, causing the moonlight above to lose its charming tone and adding a layer of sorrowful color. The piano and singing came from this window.</p>
<p>Irregular footsteps beat out rhythmic tones. Summer insects chirped shrilly by the roadside. The frog drums by the pond and the cicada strings in the branches played a symphony of the summer night. People were talking and laughing, some giving eloquent speeches, some singing in low voices, and some playing the harmonica. All these noises broke the silence of the late night.</p>
<p>We lingered by the lotus pond. The large green frogs in the pond were originally croaking vigorously, but perhaps they heard our footsteps, so when we approached a clump of cattails, they stopped abruptly. A pond of verdant lotus leaves swayed gently, and several budding lotus flowers seemed to be nodding to us. Their graceful and slender postures looked even more beautiful and lovely under the moonlight.</p>
<p>"It's late," let's go back! Finally, we walked out of the garden gate, with light hearts, and set out on our return journey.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Zhaofeng Garden on a summer night!" As I boarded the double-decker bus, I still craned my neck out of the window and softly bid it farewell, seeming to feel infinite reluctance and melancholy?</p>
