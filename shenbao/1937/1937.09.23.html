<h3>被轟炸者逾一二十處</h3>
<p>下關難民收容所與新住宅區亦被炸</p>

<p>［南京］據太原電、㊀十七日夜靈邱方面之敵、分數股向我陣地襲擊、均經擊退、十八日午、敵猛攻我白曠堡一帶陣地、我沉着堅守、陣綫無變化、㊁十七日晚、敵步騎千餘、由大同進攻左雲、經我騎兵迎頭痛擊、敵不支潰退、十八日晨該敵復向左雲南關猛攻六七次、激戰終日、敵未得逞、㊂農鎮方面之敵、步砲約兩千餘名、十六日晚向我猛攻後、復增兵三列車、於十七日晨將農鎮包圍、機砲猛烈轟城、我軍沈着應戰、激戰至下午三時、敵機砲又集中火力急攻、南門城垣倒塌數處、敵裝甲車乘勢衝入、我守兵傷亡甚多、搶堵不及、至晚十時城遂陷落、（二十三日中央社電）</p>
<h3>保定附近我軍防務鞏固</h3>
<p>平漢津浦敵將大攻</p>
<p>［北平］日軍現準備進玫平漢路與律浦路戰區之華軍陣地、故華北大戰、不久將作、以前日軍所以能佔優勢者、以華軍軍備不甚充分之故、蓋華北抗戰之華軍中、僅有四師屬於中央政府也、今南京以飛機坦克車與重砲運北作戰、是以今日戰事、將入一種新狀態中、華軍主要防綫、在滄州與保定南五十哩之鐵路間、聞華軍已築成極好防禦工事、其戰壕巧藏於保定四周之高梁田地與樹林中、且軍現已在保定北面成立十二哩陣錢、並向華軍作猛烈之轟擊、以為大舉進攻之準備、（二十二日中央社路透電）</p>

<p>［南京］日本雖揚言欲轟炸南京、然中國政府各機關、仍照常辦公、比大使與捷克大使皆已决定留駐首都、（中央社二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［南京］美大使詹森今晚偕隨員由美艦呂宋號返大使署、中國當局對於美大使之歸來、表示極大欣慰、謂此舉足見詹森雖在日機續來雙擊首都之可能景象下、準備留駐南京云、（中央社二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>上海秦晤士報云、美國駐亞洲艦隊總司令雅波爾中將二十一日晚正式宣布、美艦呂宋號與甘姆號决不離開南京、雅氏接長江美國巡邏隊來報、謂兩艦苟非由砲隊或飛機直接轟炸、無一擬移動、</p>
<p>［南京］中國國聯同志會、以敵機邇來在我國首都及其他各處肆虐破壞、昨特電促國聯迅採有效行動、並盼國際慈善機關、惠予援助我無辜被難之平民、（二十二日中央社電）</p>
<p>［日內瓦］關於日機轟炸南京事、中國出席國聯代表顧維鈞博士、頃以照會一件、送達國聯秘書長愛文諾、請其轉送國聯大會中日問題諮詢委晨會、俾得考慮各項緊急措置加以制止、內容係謂、一日本第三艦隊司令長谷川、會於本月十九日宣布擬派大隊飛機轟炸南京、并要求各國官民務於廿一日正午之前離開南京、但在此項限期尚未屆滿之前、日本飛譏即於十九二十兩日、迭向南京大施轟炸、二十日曾有該國飛機八十架左右、前往南京投擲炸彈、中國人民生命財產損失綦重、日本軍隊蔑視一切國際法規、從事破壞與不必要之恐佈行爲、於此又可獲一明證、特此種未經宣戰、即向他國首都頻施轟炸之事、若果聽其自然、則在空戰方式上、勢必造成極危險之先例、此其後患殊難勝言、相應函請貴秘書長即以此項照會提交中日問題諮詢委員會、俾得採取各項緊急措置、以制止此種非法的非人道的暴行、并希抄送國聯會各會員國行政院各理事國查照、無任企禱云、（中央社廿一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>暴日轟炸南京英美法對日抗議</h3>
<p>殘殺平民違反人道公法　日本無權要求外人撤退</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國務卿赫爾今日聲稱、美國已向日本交涉、反對日本轟炸南京、此項抗義所根據之埋由、其重要者如下、㊀轟炸非戰鬬員、違反國際與人道公法、㊁轟炸將危及美國駐南京外交代表、致妨礙中美兩國尋常關係、（中央社二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］日本大舉轟炸南京一項計劃宣佈之後、英國曾向日本政府提出交涉、此間負責方面頃宣稱、交涉內容計有三點、㊀英國軍艦决不駛離下關江面、至於英國大使館、乃係英國駐在友邦之外交機關、亦决不離開南京㊁英國不承認日本在中國境內、有向英國官廳提出此種要求或勸告之權利，㊂英國人生命倘有不測英國人所置産業倘被損害、均當保留要求賠償之權、英國政界人士頃以為英國業已决心維持一切權利、此項交涉卽所以警告日本、特恐未必能影響日本之態度耳、（中央社二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］關於日本飛機轟炸南京一事、法國政府頃訓令駐日大使亨利、向日本外務省提出抗議內稱、㊀法國反對此種轟炸、蓋此種轟炸、斷不能僅以軍事機關為限、㊁不承認日本有權要求法國駐華大使與使館官員暨僑民退出南京、㊂日本要求法國各軍艦自南京下關撤退、亦不能加以接受、㊃南京法國僑民之生命財產、倘因此而受有損害、應由日本政府負其責任云、（中央社二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國務卿赫爾今日宣稱、美國已向日本提出强硬抗議、反對日本大舉轟炸南京、該項抗議在日本宣布轟炸南京之企圖以後、不久卽由美國駐日大使格魯提交日本政府、其後復由代理國務卿摩爾向日本駐美大使齋藤複述、抗議之根據、為國際公法及任何其他伙律、皆不容有此種行動、同時日本亦無權危及美國與中國政府之關係、至於美國駐華大使詹森暫時他避一事、國務部官員認為並不失當、因美國之政策、並不希望其駐外代表甘冒追切之危險、向來美國之駐外使節、輒因不甚重要之責任、而甘冒危險、其實在危險地帶以外、亦儘可執行其職務云、國務部長復稱、美國駐外代表如報告當地發生危險、卽有避向安全地點之權、因如有生命危險、卽將發生嚴重之結果、且使館人員如扔留居危險地帶、則其他僑民自將效尤、現在美國駐華使館、仍在“呂宋”號艦上、與中國政府維持正常之關係、詹森氏之個人行動、對於中美兩國之外交關係、實無重大之影響云、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］此間政府官員今日對於美國駐華大使退出南京事、認爲正當行動、且可作爲美僑之楷模因數星期來政府已屢次催促僑民、離開危險地帶矣、惟大使退出南京、亦並不與美國反對日本轟炸南京之政策背謬、蓋使館人員之安全、僅爲微末之細節、公衆方面不應認爲政府之根本政策有何改變、據稱、美國之抗議、在九月二十日上午七時即己送達日本政府、其時英國之抗議猶未送出、國務部長赫爾聲明當時彼訓令駐日大使格魯提出强硬抗議、實不知英國亦有同樣之舉動云、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>英美輿論痛斥日軍野蠻行為</h3>
<p>獸心暴露公法蕩然　我新國魂愈趨堅强</p>
<p>［紐約］“空前之野蠻行為”、此為紐約泰晤士報對於日本恫嚇轟炸中國首都之批評、該報稱此種恫嚇、在未經挑釁未經宜戰之戰事中、欲將一大城毀滅、已使全世界駭然、而明瞭日本在中國進展之野心、民聲講壇報則謂、此種威脅、係怪異而可怖之事、已使文明戰爭之一切公法蕩然無成、至中立國家之利益、尤無置喙之餘地”云、（中央社二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［紐約］關於日本飛機大舉轟炸南京事、各報均一致加以譴責、紐約泰晤士報社評有云、日本對於中國意圖所在、各國務當加以注意、“美國應允與國聯大會中日問題諮詢委員會合作、雖附以某種條件、究亦充分予以聲援、俾西歐各國對於中國方面現所發生之慘劇、便於交換意見”、紐約民聲講壇報載稱、一俟氣候良好、日本飛機卽當實行摧毀南京、美國苟欲經由外交方法而不以大砲予以阻止、深恐無濟於事、計惟實施中立法歟云、（中央社廿二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關于日軍飛機大舉轟炸南京事、每日電聞報頃加以評論、略謂、轟炸平民一事、在世界輿論方面所可發生之影響、日本是否能于暸解、殊屬疑問、“特日本此種舉動、在其他各關係國所可發生之影饗如何、該國深謀遠慮之政治家、務須加以考慮、該國對于中國非加以封鎖、卽加以破壞、結果所屆、卽德國亦已失去中國市場、是則德國雖與日本在防共理論上抱有同情、恐亦不免為之感覺不安、此在中國、則無往而不足以證明其抵抗侵略之决心、未嘗稍見衰弱、被日軍之殘殺、與中國人民所受之苦痛、旣未動搖新興之民族情緒、反而使之愈益强固、要之、日本所進行之冒險舉動、每進一步、其國力必隨之削弱一步、因而結果亦必愈益渺茫、日本政府亟宜加以反省”云、（中央社二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］日帝國主議對華軍事冒險所遭極大困難、已使全世界報紙甚感興趣、此點不限于日方本身財政經濟制度之危機、卽其軍事活動前途亦不可靠、雖于武力上及技術上佔有優勢、英國晨郵報特派員估計中日戰爭局勢稱、華北之地形、使中國有進行游擊戰之極大可能、而中國在此方面勢力甚強、該報並稱、滿洲方面亦有發生嚴重騷擾之可能、最近偽滿軍隊已發生嚴重兵變兩次、根據此點、該報結論認定、“日本顯已陷入走頭無路之圈套”云、（二十一日塔斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］孟却斯德指導報評倫日本對於南京各大使署之警告、謂日本如眞正顧及非戰鬥者之安全、則當不轟炸南京、因南京乃非有防禦工事之都邑也、幸被威嚇而避離南京者僅美大使、其他大使與軍艦之留京、當可對於毫無防衛之平民、予以保護云、（中央社二十二日路透電）</p>

<h3>戰時糧食有通盤調節之必要</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>滬戰旣作。各地方對於民食𣅜有相當之設施如滬市之有民食調節委員會。粵閩穌鄂晋諸省。亦先後管理其境內之糧食。惟是戰事方始。未來民食之處置。尚應加以深切之考慮蓋戰時交通旣有種種之阻碍。自無平時之便利。以往產米諸省。尚以轉運不靈。穀賤為慮。本年多處豐收。而南北海道已阻。運銷更艱。至以洋米相接濟輸人亦必同受影響。是則今日之所急。不在嚴格防制糧食之出境。而在國內流通之暢利。不在局部一隅之足食。而在全國糧食供求之調繫不壅滯而傷農。不失調而病民。則於民食問題。解决過半矣。</p>
<p>中央業已頒有戰時糧食管理條例。尚未見諸實行。諒以茲事體大非經過相當準備。及應具條件。卽使成立一機關。亦難收良好之效果。惟戰時糧食之管理。任令地方各自為政。流弊所及。非成為變相之過籍。亦將使糧產運銷。失其敏活。此可於最近常熟扣留運滬米石證之。卽以滬市歷來民食情形而論。雖有蘇松常錫澄嘉各地米糧之來源尚需皖湘贛米以調劑。需要之鉅。可以想見。然各地餘糧設無滬市為之消納。糧價勢必大落。農民經濟。亦受影響。此中盈虛調節。正所以謀糧食產銷之停勻。又如粵省素嗜洋米。後茲亦恐將惟國米是求。故祇就食米一端。情形已甚複雜若無產銷通籌之辦法。則不問供求。而惟自保者有之。藉米禁而用以籌款者有之。於戰時民食。非徒無益。且增困難。明知此種事態。或不致卽時發現。但如各省市管理辦法。不能一致。彼此之間缺乏聯繫。產銷之間。勢必多所枉格。故目前如能集各省市管理糧食機關代表於一堂。各提出其戰時糧食管理之意見辦法。會商訂立一種各省市戰時糧食之管理通則。所有買賣採辦。交通運輸倉儲。以及款項調撥等一切手續。並其周轉便利安全。均在通盤籌晝之中。此外如糧食情報之交換。銷存糧食之統計。以及產量之調查。生產之改善固能切實辦理。亦不難收相當之效。</p>
<p>糧食問題。果能由各省市通力合作。隨時以謀改進。如指臂之相助。行見不出半年。全國糧食之調節。必能粗具規模。至是而足食足兵。勝利乃可操券矣。</p>

<h3>抗日罪言（二）</h3>
<p>— 林庚白</p>
<p>澈底抗戰中，我們要防範着一般準漢奸臣，和“日本通”，在都市的金融資本家和那些不成其爲工業資本的殖民地資本勢力掩護之下，直接或間接來鼓吹和平，牠們所標榜的，不外兩大理由·一是藉口於第三國的同情不宜喪失，一是以民族資本的摧殘為論　，這似乎都可以動體，世所謂第三國的同情，是否值得重視，我在前面的一段裏，已經有解答，後者的一說，却正是我主張澈底抗戰的出發點，因為中國的民族資本，受着帝國主義資本的壓迫，很不容易抬頭，這又是誰都知道的，特別是日本帝國主義一天不消滅，中國的民族資本，也更一天不能夠建設起來，貨品的低廉，關稅的不平等，交通的接近，以及武裝的走私，漢奸的合作，都可以使中國的民族資本，遭遇剝削。幸而中日的經濟合作，沒有實現，否則號稱合作，勢必至中國的民族資本，整個的淪於日本帝國主義的殖民地資本的地位，而成為東方第二的印度·還有一層，中國的所謂民族資本，什九在新型的都市，而新型都市的繁榮，恰是以帝國主義資本的勢力為轉移，因此最繁榮的都市，也就是帝國主義資本最發展的市塲，所謂民族的資本早已於無形中遇居附庸，同時這些新型的都市，更是這許許多年以來，中華民族性的墮落，和智識階級没落的總匯，牠一方面，既不能如歐美日小都市的促進工業化生產，而另一方面，又接受了歐美日本物質的消費率，我們試想一想，看看，民國成立後，政府的因循，官吏的頹廢貪污，以及社會方面一般的腐化和惡化，資產階級的只知以輕本榨取人民的汗血，中小資產階級的只知享樂，都由於新型的都市實為厲階，而且農村的衰落，也一半由於這些年都市的虛榮所影響，對於這不能促進生產而只供消費的新型的都市，實在是中華民族的致命傷，我們利用這空前的民族鬥爭，來毀滅新型的都市，才能澈底獲得民族的解放，才能把僵過了的民族，領導到復興的道路，這並不是中國的損失，而正是中國的催生劑。至於物質方面，若干的損失，那僅是說明了殖民地資本的勢力滅絕於中國而已！</p>
<p>其次我已經說過，日本帝國主義者這次大舉地進攻上海和蘇北，在基於猜忌和乘虛而先發制人的動機，但在這動機之中，牠們自有其預定的步驟，和片面的希望·看透這幾點，那末中日的勝負之間，眞是可以燭照而數計了·我覺着這次日本的盲動，有四大錯誤，第一是估計的不正確，牠們認為中國抗日的準備，還不會充實，由於中央政府繼續的交涉，依然傾向於妥協，牠們覺着這是很顯明的弱點，因此也就蒙着交涉的面具，突然来一個武力的威脅，自然牠們也明知這威脅必遭遇到抵抗，但僅是有限度的抵抗，而“一二八”和最近平津的惡例，又加强了牠們夢幻的安慰，卻沒有想到這估計的不正確，中國方面的答復，並不僅是有限度的抵抗，而是全面的抵抗，這裏面也為了“準漢奸”以及所謂“日本通”同樣看錯了而告訴日本以中國還沒有抗戰的決心和勇氣，使得牠們輕於試·第一是觀察的矛盾，日本方面肯定了中國抗戰的高潮，還未到來，另一方面又恐怕等待的主義給中國以喘息的機會患得患失，好像是稍縱即逝似的，因此牠們準備着短時期的軍事上壓迫，强中國屈膝，這在牠們看去似乎有把握，同時牠們明知歐美資本主義各國决不會干涉·遠東的中日之爭，但看到了英美法對華經濟的提携，又懷着嫉視和恐怖，在日本以為英美法對華的善意，只為了中國整個的統治權，依然鞏固，那末撕破了這强有力的統治權，英美法的對華，勢必宣布退却，而不再有經濟的合作·第三是對人的嘗試，日本帝國主義者始終看不淸楚我們最高领袖的態度，恰和中國一部分的人民，歷來懷着中央政府的抗日，不同而同，所以近衛未組閣以前，在案伏高信們的座談會，曾明白這樣説過，大意是，“日本眞的要和中國合作時，蔣介石的態度有加以監視的必要·一這懷疑之蛇，同樣蠢動於每一個日本軍閥相依附於軍閥的機會主義官僚，如近衛廣田之流的心目中，因此牠們必須在密邇中央政府所在地的上海，猛烈襲擊，妄冀藉此以測騐有力的統治者最後的表現·而且牠們認為中國的統一，尚未完全成熟，急進則有各個擊破的可能，而不知適得其反。第四是安內的運用，自“二一六”政變以後，日本帝國主義者內在的矛盾，日益尖銳化，軍閥們利用大和民族共有的狹隘愛國主義，不得不假藉對外為號召，旣可以轉移視綫把一切的力量集中，而且這策略的成功，顯見是軍事的勝利，進而支配整個的政治·那時候軍閥的權威，高於一切，如操左券，對立的矛盾自然消失，而不知戰爭的前途，未可逆覩。</p>
<p>綜合起來，這四大錯誤的結果，就產生了三方面的敗失。一是政治和經濟方面的失敗，一是外交方面的失敗，一是軍事方面的失敗，讓我更補充的說：</p>
<p>為了內在矛盾的消弭，和對外資源的奪取，日本帝國義者不惜急遽的大舉進攻中國，但曠日持久，在龐大的軍費之支出和各階級利害的不一致之下，民不堪命國無餘力，革命的爆發，隨時回慮。我們試看“一二八”的戰爭，那樣短短的三十多天中，日本的海軍已發現有共產黨運動，就是證明，而且這次的軍事，也僅及一個月。日本已增加預算三次，同時也已到了衛兵第一期。這都暴露了舉鼎絕臏的現象，而且戰時對華貿易的破產以及國際市塲上證劵的跌價，又是很顯明的事實，欲安內而適以召內憂之媒，欲拓資而轉致金融和輕工業的崩潰。這不是日本在政治和經濟上的失敗是甚麼？</p>
<p>日本對華武力的侵略，除了領土和資源的慾求外，企圖製　成中日共同對蘇的局勢，所謂防共協定的醖釀，已是舉世皆知，因此更不能不於蘇聯的肅軍和中國的備戰中，先發制人，如前面所說，但牠們肯定了蘇聯一時的自顧不暇，和中國的徘徊於英美之間必不能立即聯合，同時却又不肯稍放鬆这樣矛盾的政策，以武力來替代外交，只不外為了急於威脅中日共同防共的實現。不料武力威脅的结果、倒反促進了中蘇不侵犯協定的締結。同時日本欲以實力阻撓歐美資本主義各國，如英美法乏類，對華經濟的提携，而不曾想到，這些國家都是很聰明的·牠們對華的態度，有待於戰局的决定，決不是日本的實力所能動搖，甚至德意也認為中日的戰爭，於歐州無直接的利害，暫取旁觀，雖則有最近墨案里尼使德之說，那也只為了歐州本身的問題，如當前的地中海問題之類，即使牽涉到遠東問題，也只是附帶討論·這樣看起來，日本的孤立已明，這不是日本在外交上的失敗是甚麼？</p>
<p>軍事的影響，自然更大，但以中國幅員之遼廓，日本兵力之有限，戰區過於擴張，捉襟立時見肘，這次日本帝國主義者對於山東及華南，僅有游擊的擾亂，也不管顯著說明了兵力之不敷分配，和牠們之所以必須傾全力於上海和華北，那末相持愈久，力量愈消耗，發展也愈更不易、而且日本所恃以張舉武力者，僅軍械比較充實，此外皆遠不及中國，尤其是軍隊補充的困難，和士兵經驗的缺乏，以及高額的兵餉，中日恰都成了什一的比例，一日慘敗、復難為繼、異動乘之，譁變可慮，這不是日本在軍事上的失敗是甚麼？</p>
<p>我們知道了日本的四大錯誤和三方面的失敗，自然狠明瞭於這次戰爭的前途，但中國方面，我們也不能不精密地觀察一下·我個人所感到的，中國在抗戰中，有十二個必要的注意，現在一一來說明牠：</p>
<p>第一是人民的失業，應如何補救？</p>
<p>第二是一般的生活，應如何安定？</p>
<p>第三是漢奸的叛逆，應如何肅淸？</p>
<p>第四是生產應如何調整？</p>
<p>第五是交通應如何持續？</p>
<p>第六是建設應如何策進？　　第七是應如何運用民衆？</p>
<p>第八是應如何領導靑年？</p>
<p>第九是應如何統制言論？</p>
<p>第十是應如何使地方的力量發展？</p>
<p>第十一是應如伺使敵人的？</p>
<p>第十二是應如何使國際的宣傳有利？</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>自八一三事變發生。我們也知道對內對外宣傳的重要。但是宣傳的方法。總是不見得十分高明。我想我們實傳的工作。還應該去採取敵人的方法。茲姑據二事為例。</p>
<p>㊀前日本埠日人某無綫電播音。用流利的中國語。播告聽衆。謂目擊南京之空戰者言。南京各機關之房屋。除外交部外。均中飛機之炸彈而焚燬。外交部亦幾擊中。南京已化焦土云云。</p>
<p>請注意。這是前天的報告。南京已成焦土。但是昨日又有大批敵機飛往首都襲。試問再去轟炸些甚麼。</p>
<p>㊁二十二日同盟社電。兹據本日陸軍省之到達情報。藉悉南京政府决一窮途之策。目的在使直接戰火波及於外國各權利。使第三國罐入紛爭漩渦。似有利用日本空軍空襲南京之際。將乘機用中國空軍之飛機。從事轟炸英蘇大使館之企圖云云。</p>
<p>請注意。前日日第三艦隊司令長谷川。照會各國大使。避開南京。經各大使一致拒絕。於是用這樣一個宣傳的方法。萬一炸彈故意或亂投到英蘇大使館的屋頂上。他可以諉卸到我們空軍的身上。而脫卻自己的責任。</p>
<p>以上兩種的宣傳方法。一是宣傳已往的事件。無中生有。一是防止後來發生的事件可以脫卸責任。這種宣傳何等巧妙而有意思。我此刻無暇加以嚴重的批判惟有深深地敬佩敵人的聰明而已。</p>

<h3>急不待緩的戰時產業配置</h3>
<p>— 魏友棐</p>
<p>我國全面抗戰，决不是說每一塊士上爆發了戰爭，而是說要激發每一個人的各盡力量，來從事於抗禦侵略者的戰爭。所以前綫的軍士們在陣地上作業，這是抗戰！后方嚴肅地做一切戰時配置工作，這也是抗戰！</p>
<p>滬戰一匝月，我們前方的抗戰力量充分地顯揚出來！可是却向時可以指出，我們的援方配置太不行了！這那裹是戰時配置？這是平時！雖然不能抹殺，許多人在嚴肅地做着救亡工作，但從全面抗戰的意義上說來，顯然是非常不够。這裹我所要提出的，是產業的配置計劃。</p>
<p>一切戰時經濟政治措置的唯一目標，是在後方充實抗戰力量，使政府隨時有動員可能。而我們產業界，狹義一些說是工廠，就不是這樣。在戰前，不錯，他們在開工製造；戰事爆發了，他們不能工作了，就停工。不在砲火下的工廠，又慢慢地復工了，在砲火範圍內的工廠，沒法工作，就聽他停滯著，聽他炸燬了！這那裹是戰時院置？這是樂天知命式的因循生活！</p>
<p>消息傳來，虹口區域內的許多大規模工廠，申新五七廠不能工作，華成烟公司被炸燬了，五和織造廠被炸燬了，南洋烟公司也被炸燬了。这許多工廠的出品，不一定於抗戰有直接的補助，可是我們敢說，這都是我們的生產機關，也就是我們抗戰力量。這並不是僅乎一個人或幾惆人集合資本的事業，而實是全國四萬五千萬大衆的生產機關；幾個人或許有力量担負了被炸燬的損失，可是許許多多，直接間接的靠着工廠生活的工人，以及靠着出品的消費者，他們都要受到影響。工人失業，不能生活，這是抗戰力量的損失！出品減少了，生產停滯了，這也是抗戰力量的損失!</p>
<p>不是有許多人在喊著到內地去的嗎？不是有許多人希望政府到現在還不給戰區內工廠想想辦法的嗎？這都是空論。我們需要實際的工作。</p>
<p>今日到內地去的工廠是有的。但他們的遷移工作，有的是從閘北邊到了法租界，也有從上海遷到了蘇州長沙，漢日或南昌。總而言之，每一個工廠雖在遷移，但咆火下的運送是很困難的，每個人的力量是有限的，他們雖盡了可能力量，但成就還不很多。</p>
<p>固然這一種領導的責任應該交給國家，但是在國家沒有命令之前，工廠应該自己想辦法。</p>
<p>工廠到內地去這是天經地義，第一點要决定的，是把工業區來劃分起來，指給工廠來搬運。換言之，把工廠從閘北搬到法租界，雖不妨害生產，可是這决平是澈底的辦法，政府應該指定那裹是工業中心，是安全區，把工廠集中到那裹去．為分配盡善計，還應該指定某類的工廠應該集中到那裹，某處的某類工廠以多少為限。在出品方面，也指定那幾種必要品須加緊製造，那幾種消耗品須停止製造，或減少製造，把那些力量省下來，集中到必需品的製造。</p>
<p>搬運的集中區已定，再來討論搬運的方法，用每一工廠力量來搬運，不如用集團的力量來搬運，如果能由政府來搬運更好。搬運的時候，政府儘量予以便利，或分期搬運，或分區搬運，到達了目的地。</p>
<p>搬運到內地之𢓭，就要開始工作，工作必須營運資本，這資本當然須由國家銀行供給。我的意見，最好在政府助工廠搬運的時候，就把那些救濟費用或運送費用做國家加股的資本。搬到了內地之後，再將新的廠基向國家銀行貼放，那貼放得來的款項就是營運資本。</p>
<p>這一次是長期的抗戰，是全面的抗戰，我們决不能抱茍安的態度誤了自己，也誤了國家。因此，在上海的工廠固然需要搬運，在一切海岸，以及非工業區內的工廠也需要集中。我們抗戰的最終目的是求生，我們需要生產，需要增長國家生產力。</p>
<p>現在總括我對於戰時產業配置意見如下：㊀指定工業區域，由國家力量補助集中：㊁由國家貸予資本，私人經營，而國家監理；㊂國家負分配的責任，並實行保息的辦法，來招致民間資本。（九月二十二日）</p>

<h3>日空軍實力的估價</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>自詡為五強之一的日本對於我國是一向看輕的。“不要三大，可以征服支那全土，”“不要二小時，可以估領全上海”這兩句話，是自命為一中國通而主張併吞中國的日本軍人們所常說的，可是從現今事實上的證明，早已成為夢囈了。單就上海一隅而言，敵人已用全國海陸空的力量，進攻了一個多月，結果徒耗了五六萬萬元的軍費，燬滅了七八十架飛機，死傷了二萬光景的海陸軍將士，沉沒了幾支軍艦，而封於我國，則除摧毀了我國的文化建築，慘殺了幾千無辜的平民以外，可說一無所得。現在我單就日本空軍的實力，來檢討一番。</p>
<p>日本空軍的建立，為期不過十年。昭和七年民國廿一年（陸上部隊飛機，祇有白三十六架，其𢓭逐漸添造，陸軍方面有常備機五百八十架，除了防守國內要區外，可共戰鬥用的不到三百架。到了前年度，（昭和十年）預算總額增加一千八百萬元，駕駛員有五百八十九人，是年又樹立了“大空十年計劃。”因為預算方面為大藏省所反對，不能夠通過，引起“遞信”“大藏”兩省的傾軋，於是預定的方針，歸於泡影。可是陸續購造的，到有一千六百餘架·飛機的種類，有陸軍用二海軍用”之別。陸軍用的，為㊀五二式偵察機，㊁九二式戰鬥機，㊂八七式重爆機，㊃八八式輕爆機等四種。海軍用的有㊀一三式艦上攻擊機，（赤城，加賀，龍驤，鳳翔四隻航空母艦上，都裝載這機，）㊁九○式水上偵察機，㊆九○式飛艇（全長二十餘米突，重十五噸，二千四百馬力，速力二百二十基羅米突）等三種。民間航空，自十年計畫樹立𢓭，亦逐漸發達，最近為侵華計，已將民間所有的大型運輸機，改裝為重轟炸機；又將小型的飛機，改為偵察機興戰門機。其戰鬥機的飛速，為三百基羅米突，昇空高度八千米突，飛航時間不過三小時。機上祇乘一人，裝有機關槍二架，槍的口徑大約在七生的至八生的，一分間可發射七百發以上。陸軍用者為木製甲式四型，速力三百馬力，與輕合金製的五一式，速力四百五十馬力，偵察機為木製乙式一型，速力二百三十馬力與輕合金製的八八式，速力四百五十馬力，及九二式，速力四百馬力，偵察機上乘司機一人，偵察員一人，亦裝有機關槍二架·八七式轟炸機有附屬機八八式，速力二百公里，飛航力最大的，不過十小時，昇空高度五千米突，陸軍的航空飛行隊，第一第二設在嶼阜，第三在滋賀縣御園村，第四在福岡，第五在東京立川，第六在朝鮮平壤，第七在濱松，第八在台灣台北，千葉縣都賀村，設有氣球隊，他如長野，新瀉，大阪，富山，德島，高知，島取，仙台，松江，靑森，札幌等，均有機場，至於名古屋飛行學校，亞西亞飛行學校，日本輕飛行機俱樂部，日本航空輸送研究所等，不過是訓練初步航空人才的地方·製造飛機工场有三菱，川崎，川西，石川等；這等工場祇能製造局部附屬機件，重要機件，仍舊要𠈟仗於歐美各國·去年來國內大唱“空軍高速化”在大阪添設第二國際飛機場，米子添設飛機場，開拓民間航空運輸，問時獎勵飛機與發動機的試作，可是創造了所謂一一式國產伏秀機𢓭，經次的試飛，即墮地自燬了，總之日本航空技術的幼稚，連日人自已也很擔憂的，據敵軍陸軍中將四王天延孝說，二八戰爭時日機在蘇州杭州上空作戰，小谷少佐一戰而死，各務原地方本來想養成大批飛行七，然而合格者不過八名，尤以市民對於航空知識，非常欠缺，而日本的建築物都是木材，倘若受到五百公斤的炸彈一瞬間就可把名古屋全市延燒開來”。法國佳諾大佐說。“如用十幾架飛機編隊向東京轟炸，那大東京在一小時內立可變為焦土，所以日本全土，假使受了空軍的脅迫，十小時內，完全可變成廢墟。”又日人池崎忠孝說“將來日美如發生戰爭，美國的空軍，實在可以制我日本的死命，就是美國空軍佔領了小笠原鳥，那末不但日本海軍完全失效，而全日本必成為焦土，所以充實航空隊以對抗敵軍，實為不容緩的。”陸軍步兵中校中山四郎說：“我日本最慮者，為俄美兩國的空軍，因爲四面環海而積狹長的日本領土，倘若來了一二隻航空母艦潛入海上，而我日本各大都市，大工場地帶，都位於海岸，敵的空軍是很容易飛來滋擾的。”</p>

<h3>Our Air Force Repeatedly Achieves Miraculous Feats in the Capital Air Battle</h3>
<p>Enemy Planes Again Invade the Capital in Force Yesterday Morning; Four Enemy Planes Shot Down by Our Air Force in the Suburbs; Several Places in the City Damaged but Not Significantly; Enemy Planes Returned in the Afternoon but Dared Not Intrude</p>
<p>[Nanjing] At 10:11 AM on the 22nd, 51 enemy bombers and fighter planes attacked the capital. Our air force had taken off in advance to prepare for a head-on counterattack. At around 11:00 AM, the two armies met in the suburbs of Nanjing and a fierce battle ensued. Our heroic soldiers, taking advantage of their high position, densely strafed the enemy planes with machine guns. The enemy army, unable to resist, had two planes hit and wounded, fleeing in disarray. One crashed and burned more than 30 *li* north of Pukou, and another exploded and crashed near Zhenjiang. The remaining enemy planes, in desperation, joined together with more than ten planes to pounce on one of our fighter planes. Due to the disparity in numbers, our plane was damaged and landed on the water across the river from Sanwenhe. Two soldiers suffered minor injuries. The enemy planes then fled in the direction of Jiangyin. Our air force warrior, Mr. Dong Mingde, eager to attack the enemy, single-handedly pursued them fiercely. When he reached the airspace over Jiangyin, he managed to keep an enemy bomber within his machine gun range. After a battle lasting several minutes, the enemy plane's fuel tank was hit and caught fire, emitting a wisp of yellow smoke. The plane crashed to the ground with a huge explosion that shook the surrounding area for several *li*. The remaining enemy planes fiercely besieged Mr. Dong's plane. Mr. Dong quickly soared into the sky. Seeing no opportunity to take advantage and under severe threat, the enemy planes had no choice but to flee quickly. By the time Mr. Dong flew back to the airspace over Nanjing, the alert had already been lifted. While our air force was engaging the enemy outside the city, more than ten enemy planes took the opportunity to sneak into the airspace over Nanjing. For a time, anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns fired in unison. The enemy planes all flew frantically high, and as our army rushed from outside the city to pursue, the enemy army became even more panicked. After briefly engaging with our army, they dropped bombs in various places. It is estimated that five bombs landed on the Central Party Headquarters, destroying many houses with only minor damage. The rest landed in ponds and wasteland (more than ten each), on roads (seven or eight), and on civilian houses (more than ten), killing or wounding more than forty civilians and destroying more than fifty houses. By 11:45 AM, the alert was lifted and everything returned to normal. Subsequent investigations revealed that four enemy planes were shot down by us. In addition to the three already confirmed, one more is still being searched for. As for our two wounded soldiers, their injuries are to the face and they will be healed within days. The plane was not damaged as it fell into the water and can still participate in combat after minor repairs. At 1:11 PM, 21 enemy planes came again to carry out a second invasion. When they discovered that our air force was already lined up in the sky to meet them, they dared not intrude into the airspace over the city and instead scurried to the vicinity of Pukou and the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Station, dropping more than ten bombs before leaving. Our army did not pursue them relentlessly. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Driven Away in Fierce Battle Over Zhenjiang; One Crashed Near Jingjiang</h3>
<p>[Zhenjiang] Enemy planes that were spying on the water this morning were chased by our planes to the skies over Zhenjiang, where a fierce battle occurred. The enemy planes, unable to withstand the attack, retreated. One was severely damaged and its flight was unstable, eventually crashing near Jingjiang. At around 1:00 PM, 21 enemy planes attacked Nanjing and were driven away, passing through the skies over Zhenjiang at a very high altitude and fleeing eastward. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Four Enemy Planes Shot Down by Us</h3>
<p>Our Air Force Engages in Battle with Fierce Anti-Aircraft Gun Fire</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A large group of Japanese planes flew to Nanjing today to bomb. The Chinese Air Force immediately flew up to meet the enemy, and anti-aircraft guns also fired fiercely. It is reported that as many as four Japanese planes were shot down. About thirty or forty Japanese planes attacked today, from 10:35 AM to noon. An alert was issued in Nanjing city at 10:10 AM, and citizens took cover in droves. At 10:35 AM, an emergency alert was issued, and Chinese planes took off to intercept. About half an hour later, several enemy planes sneaked into the city from the southeast, flying at an altitude of about 10,000 feet. Viewed from the sunlight, they were just a few small black dots in the sky. When they reached the south of the city, the lead plane emitted a smoke signal, and at the same time, all the planes dropped bombs. The ground-based anti-aircraft guns immediately bombarded them. At this time, another team of Japanese planes, after failing to lure the Chinese planes away from their main force, flew across the Yangtze River and dropped several bombs in the Pukou area. It is also reported that a large group of Japanese planes took off from Shanghai this morning and went west, and Chinese fighter planes intercepted them along the way. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>More Than Twenty Places Bombed</h3>
<p>The Xiaguan Refugee Camp and New Residential Area Also Bombed</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Japanese planes attacked the capital twice today. The first attack involved more than fifty Japanese planes and lasted from 10:35 AM to noon. The second attack, which occurred at noon, involved only fifteen planes and lasted a very short time. More than thirty places, including densely populated areas south of the city, were bombed. The new residential area where the American, Italian, and German embassies are located, which is a cluster of residences for foreigners living in Nanjing, was also affected. In the past, Japanese planes only attacked airfields, arsenals, and other military installations, but this time they carried out large-scale bombing of residential areas, which surprised foreigners. In addition, Xiaguan, which is not far from where British, French, American, and Italian warships are moored, was also targeted by Japanese planes. Although the exact number of deaths is not yet known, the Xiaguan refugee camp alone was bombed by Japanese planes during the second attack, resulting in the deaths of more than a hundred refugees. Chinese planes engaged in battle twice, and anti-aircraft guns also swept the sky. Although Japanese planes dropped many bombs, the material damage was minimal. Japanese planes dropped many projectiles the size of rice bowls south of the city. Many fell in front of the ABC Western Restaurant, and the roads were blasted into holes. However, in the new residential area, Japanese planes dropped large bombs weighing about 250 kilograms. Zhongshan Road at the intersection of Shanxi Road was blasted into a huge crack, and two bombs also landed on a small hill at the intersection of Ningxia Road. Nearby residences shook violently, window panes were shattered, and many light bulbs were shaken to the ground. The Japanese planes also clearly targeted the Ministry of Interior and the Garrison Headquarters south of the city, but their aim was inaccurate, and only seven residences behind a pawnshop and the Bank of China were destroyed. Fortunately, the residents were unharmed, as they had all taken refuge in bomb shelters. The Telegraph Bureau was also one of the Japanese planes' targets, but it was not hit. Several bombs fell nearby, and three bombs fell into the Qinhuai River. In addition, five bombs fell near the Central Party Headquarters, destroying several houses, and the Minsheng Hotel behind the Party Headquarters was also affected. A nearby bridge was also completely destroyed. After the Xiaguan refugee camp was bombed, blood and flesh flew everywhere, a horrific scene. The straw sheds that housed thousands of refugees were set on fire by the bombs, and the thick smoke shot straight into the sky, visible for miles around. Several bombs also fell near the Xiaguan coal port, causing several fires. The second attack began at 1:50 PM and lasted less than ten minutes. Because of the intense anti-aircraft fire, the enemy planes only dropped bombs from a very high altitude. The alert was lifted at 2:20 PM. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Relief and Rehabilitation by the Relief Committee</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Regarding the enemy planes' two attacks on Nanjing on the 22nd, Zhu Qinglan, Director of the Relief Committee, is very concerned about the housing problems of the disaster victims whose houses were destroyed. In addition to personally going to various places to inspect, he dispatched Sun Ya'fu to investigate. If food and clothing problems arise due to the bombing, relief will be provided.

<p>[Zhengzhou] A large number of enemy planes have been flying to Baoding for bombing for several days, and many residential houses have been destroyed, but there have been few deaths or injuries. Villages and towns north of Shijiazhuang have also been bombed. On the morning of the 21st, enemy planes went to Shijiazhuang again to bomb, causing very little damage.

<p>[Nantong] Seven enemy planes spied on Tong on the 22nd. Four enemy warships shelled the Langshan Port, killing or wounding seven people and causing minor damage. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attack Guangzhou Three Times; Four Shot Down by Us</h3>
<p>Another Enemy Plane Heavily Damaged</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] At 2:30 AM on the 22nd, a large number of enemy planes attacked Guangzhou. Our planes engaged them, and they left after a four-hour battle. The alert was lifted at 6:30 AM. Four enemy planes were shot down and one was heavily damaged. More than ten bombs were dropped in the northeast suburbs, causing no damage. Several bombs were dropped in the city in Yuntai Lane, Jinghui Street, Qiyun Lane, and Chaotian Street, destroying more than ten civilian houses and injuring dozens of people. Two bombs landed on the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, both hitting the lawn and causing no injuries. A few minutes after the alert was lifted, seven enemy planes came again to bomb. The Zengbu Industrial Zone was not hit. The alert was lifted at 8:30 AM. At 1:00 PM, six enemy planes attacked for the third time and then left. At 2:05 PM, another alert was issued, but this time the enemy planes were driven away midway and did not enter the city. All enemy planes came from aircraft carriers in the Pearl River Estuary. Our air force fought day and night without fatigue, and the citizens showed no fear, many climbing onto rooftops to watch the battle. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] How much loss of life and property occurred during the Japanese planes' two attacks this morning is not yet known. During the second attack, from 7:10 AM to 7:30 AM, enemy planes dropped bombs and destroyed several civilian houses west of the city, and two bombs landed in front of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. It is reported that several civilians were killed or injured. The first attack lasted the longest, from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM. This was the first time that Guangzhou residents had experienced a night raid. The first attack focused on the northeast region, while the second attack bombed the suburbs and the airfield. However, it is reported that the airfield did not suffer any significant damage. During the two attacks, an American woman and her young child were injured, having been knocked down by the blast waves from nearby bombs, but their injuries were not serious and they were only frightened. Foreigners on Shamian are safe, except for the threat of shrapnel. Many foreigners are still staying in Dongshan, which is quite close to the Chinese airfield, and the Japanese planes are targeting the airfield for bombing, so it is more dangerous. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>One Enemy Plane Shot Down in Yanzhou</h3>
<p>[Jinan] Eleven enemy planes flew to Ziyang (i.e., Yanzhou) at about 3:00 PM on the 21st and dropped bombs, causing slight damage to the railway tracks. One enemy plane was hit by us, caught fire, and crashed next to the station. Both pilots were killed. The wings of the enemy plane were dark gray and had the words "Nakajima Type, manufactured on August 18, Showa 11" (August 18, 1936) on them. The remains of the destroyed plane have been transported away by the local garrison. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Fengzhen Falls</h3>
<p>Enemy Attack on Zuoyun Unsuccessful</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to a telegram from Taiyuan: ❶ On the night of the 17th, the enemy from the Lingqiu area attacked our positions in several groups, but they were all repelled. At noon on the 18th, the enemy fiercely attacked our positions in the Baikuangbao area. We defended steadfastly and the front line remained unchanged. ❷ On the evening of the 17th, more than a thousand enemy infantry and cavalry attacked Zuoyun. Our cavalry launched a head-on counterattack, and the enemy, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed and retreated. On the morning of the 18th, the enemy launched six or seven fierce attacks on the south gate of Zuoyun, engaging in fierce fighting all day. The enemy was unsuccessful. ❸ The enemy forces in the Fengzhen area, consisting of about two thousand infantry and artillery, launched a fierce attack on us on the evening of the 16th, and then reinforced their troops with three trainloads. On the morning of the 17th, they surrounded Fengzhen and subjected the city to intense bombardment from aircraft and artillery. Our troops responded calmly and engaged in fierce fighting until 3:00 PM. The enemy's aircraft and artillery then concentrated their fire on a fierce attack, causing several breaches in the city walls of the south gate. Enemy armored vehicles took the opportunity to rush in. Our defending soldiers suffered heavy casualties and were unable to block them in time. The city then fell at 10:00 PM.

<h3>Our Defenses Near Baoding are Consolidated</h3>
<p>Enemy to Launch Major Offensives on the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways</p>
<p>[Beiping] The Japanese army is now preparing to advance on the Chinese army's positions in the Pinghan Railway and Jinpu Railway war zones. Therefore, a major battle in North China will soon take place. In the past, the Japanese army was able to gain the upper hand because the Chinese army's equipment was not very adequate. Of the Chinese forces fighting in North China, only four divisions belong to the central government. Now Nanjing is transporting aircraft, tanks, and heavy artillery north for combat, so today's war will enter a new stage. The main line of defense of the Chinese army is between Cangzhou and 50 miles south of Baoding on the railway. It is reported that the Chinese army has built excellent fortifications, and their trenches are cleverly hidden in the sorghum fields and woods around Baoding. The army has now established a 12-mile defense line north of Baoding and is launching fierce bombardments of the Chinese army as preparation for a major offensive. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] It is reported that Song Zheyuan recently sent a telegram to Nanjing reporting that the enemy forces in the Gu'an area are now using asphyxiating gas. Fortunately, our forward soldiers had prepared gas masks in advance, so there were no casualties. However, several farmers in the war zone who were unable to escape have been poisoned.

<h3>The Brutal Japanese Army Bombs the Capital; Our Government Remains Very Calm</h3>
<p>We Ask the League of Nations to Take Note of Japan's Atrocities</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Although Japan has threatened to bomb Nanjing, the various organs of the Chinese government are still operating as usual. The British Ambassador and the Czech Ambassador have both decided to remain in the capital. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] American Ambassador Johnson returned to the embassy tonight from the American warship *Luzon* with his staff. The Chinese authorities expressed great satisfaction at the American Ambassador's return, saying that this demonstrated that Johnson was prepared to remain in Nanjing despite the possibility of continued Japanese air raids on the capital. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>The *Shanghai Qin Wu Shi Bao* (Shanghai China Press) states that Rear Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, formally announced on the evening of the 21st that the U.S. warships *Luzon* and *Guam* would not leave Nanjing. Yarnell received a report from the U.S. Yangtze River Patrol stating that the two warships would not move unless directly bombed by artillery or aircraft.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The China League of Nations Association, in response to the enemy planes' recent rampant destruction in our nation's capital and other places, yesterday telegraphed the League of Nations urging it to take effective action as soon as possible and hoping that international charitable organizations would provide assistance to our innocent civilian victims. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the Japanese planes' bombing of Nanjing, Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative to the League of Nations, recently sent a note to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, requesting that it be forwarded to the League of Nations Assembly's Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Issues for consideration of various emergency measures to stop it. The content stated: 1. Japanese Third Fleet Commander Hasegawa announced on the 19th of this month his intention to dispatch a large number of planes to bomb Nanjing, and requested that officials and citizens of all countries leave Nanjing before noon on the 21st. However, before this deadline had even passed, Japanese planes repeatedly bombed Nanjing on the 19th and 20th. On the 20th, about eighty planes from that country went to Nanjing to drop bombs, resulting in heavy losses of life and property for the Chinese people. The Japanese military disregards all international laws and regulations, engaging in destructive and unnecessary acts of terror, which is another clear example. Given that such bombing of another country's capital without a declaration of war, if allowed to continue unchecked, will inevitably create an extremely dangerous precedent in aerial warfare, the consequences of which would be difficult to overcome. It is appropriate to request that Your Excellency the Secretary-General submit this note to the Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Issues so that it can take various emergency measures to stop such illegal and inhuman acts, and to copy it to the administrative councils of all member states of the League of Nations and the governing councils for their information. I am immensely hopeful. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>The Brutal Japanese Bombing of Nanjing; Britain, America, and France Protest to Japan</h3>
<p>Massacring Civilians Violates Humanitarian International Law; Japan Has No Right to Demand the Withdrawal of Foreigners</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull stated today that the United States has lodged a protest with Japan against the Japanese bombing of Nanjing. The important reasons for this protest are as follows: ❶ Bombing non-combatants violates international and humanitarian law. ❷ Bombing will endanger American diplomatic representatives in Nanjing, thereby hindering normal relations between the United States and China. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[London] After the announcement of the Japanese plan to bomb Nanjing on a large scale, Britain lodged a protest with the Japanese government. Responsible parties here recently announced that the content of the protest included three points: ❶ British warships will never leave the Jiangguan section of the river. As for the British Embassy, it is a diplomatic mission of Britain stationed in a friendly country and will also never leave Nanjing. ❷ Britain does not recognize that Japan has the right to make such requests or recommendations to British authorities within Chinese territory. ❸ Britain reserves the right to demand compensation if British lives are lost or British-owned property is damaged. British political figures recently believe that Britain has resolved to maintain all its rights, and this protest is therefore a warning to Japan, but they are afraid that it may not affect Japan's attitude. (Central News Agency Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the Japanese planes' bombing of Nanjing, the French government recently instructed the French Ambassador to Japan, Henri, to lodge a protest with the Japanese Foreign Ministry, stating: ❶ France opposes such bombing, as it cannot be limited to military installations alone. ❷ It does not recognize that Japan has the right to demand that the French Ambassador to China and embassy officials and expatriates withdraw from Nanjing. ❸ The Japanese request that French warships withdraw from Nanjing Jiangguan cannot be accepted. ❹ The Japanese government shall be responsible for any damage to the lives and property of French expatriates in Nanjing as a result. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull stated today that the United States has lodged a strong protest with Japan against Japan's large-scale bombing of Nanjing. The protest was submitted to the Japanese government by U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew shortly after Japan announced its intention to bomb Nanjing. It was later reiterated to Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito by Acting Secretary of State Moore. The basis of the protest is that international law and any other laws do not allow for such actions, and Japan has no right to endanger relations between the United States and the Chinese government. As for the temporary avoidance of danger by U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson, officials from the State Department believe that it is not inappropriate, because U.S. policy does not want its representatives abroad to recklessly take on imminent danger. In the past, U.S. envoys abroad often took risks for relatively unimportant responsibilities, but in fact, they can perform their duties even outside of dangerous areas. The Secretary of State added that U.S. representatives abroad have the right to move to a safe place if they report that danger is present, because if there is a danger to life, serious consequences will occur, and if embassy personnel remain in dangerous areas, other expatriates will follow suit. Currently, the U.S. Embassy in China is still on the warship *Luzon*, maintaining normal relations with the Chinese government. Mr. Johnson's personal actions have no significant impact on the diplomatic relations between the United States and China. (National Telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>[Washington] Government officials here today consider the U.S. Ambassador's withdrawal from Nanjing to be a proper action and can serve as a model for American expatriates, because the government has repeatedly urged expatriates to leave dangerous areas for several weeks. However, the Ambassador's withdrawal from Nanjing is not contrary to the U.S. policy of opposing Japan's bombing of Nanjing, because the safety of embassy personnel is only a minor detail, and the public should not think that there is any fundamental change in the government's policy. It is said that the U.S. protest was delivered to the Japanese government at 7:00 AM on September 20, at which time the British protest had not yet been sent. Secretary of State Hull stated that he instructed Ambassador to Japan Grew to lodge a strong protest at that time, and he did not know that Britain had also taken similar action.

<h3>Anglo-American Public Opinion Bitterly Condemns the Japanese Army's Barbaric Behavior</h3>
<p>Beastly Hearts Exposed, Public Law Annihilated; Our New National Soul Grows Ever Stronger</p>
<p>[New York] "Unprecedented barbaric behavior," this is how the New York Times criticized Japan's intimidation and bombing of China's capital. The newspaper stated that this kind of intimidation, in a war that was unprovoked and undeclared, aimed to destroy a large city, has shocked the world and made clear Japan's ambitions in its advance in China. The New York Post stated that this threat is a strange and terrifying thing, which has rendered all the public laws of civilized warfare useless, and leaves no room for the interests of neutral countries to speak of. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[New York] Regarding the large-scale bombing of Nanjing by Japanese aircraft, all newspapers unanimously condemned it. An editorial in the New York Times stated that all countries must pay attention to Japan's intentions towards China. "The United States should agree to cooperate with the League of Nations' advisory committee on the Sino-Japanese issue, and although it is attached to certain conditions, it is fully supported, so that Western European countries can easily exchange opinions on the tragedy currently occurring in China." The New York Post reported that once the weather is good, Japanese aircraft will carry out the destruction of Nanjing. If the United States wants to stop it through diplomatic means without artillery, I am afraid it will be in vain. The only plan is to implement the Neutrality Act. (Havas telegram from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the large-scale bombing of Nanjing by Japanese aircraft, the Daily Telegraph recently commented, roughly saying that it is doubtful whether Japan can understand the impact that the bombing of civilians can have on world public opinion. "Especially how this kind of action by Japan can affect other related countries, the country's far-sighted politicians must consider it. If the country does not blockade or destroy China, the result will be that even Germany has lost the Chinese market. Even though Germany sympathizes with Japan on the anti-communist theory, I am afraid it cannot help but feel uneasy. In China, it is more than enough to prove its determination to resist aggression, and has never shown the slightest weakness. The killing of the Chinese people by the Japanese army and the suffering suffered by the Chinese people have not shaken the emerging national sentiment, but have made it stronger. In short, every step Japan takes in its adventurous actions, its national strength will be weakened by one step, and therefore the results will be even more vague. The Japanese government should seriously reflect on this." (Havas telegram from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The extreme difficulties encountered by the Japanese imperialists in their military adventures in China have aroused great interest in newspapers around the world. This is not limited to the crisis in Japan's own financial and economic system, but also the uncertain future of its military activities. Although it has superiority in force and technology, the British Morning Post correspondent estimates the situation of the Sino-Japanese War, saying that the terrain of North China gives China a great possibility of conducting guerrilla warfare, and China has a very strong force in this regard. The newspaper also stated that there is a possibility of serious disturbances in Manchuria. Recently, serious mutinies have occurred twice in the puppet Manchukuo army. Based on this point, the newspaper concluded that "Japan has obviously fallen into a dead end." (TASS telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>[London] The Manchester Guardian commented on Japan's warning to the major embassies in Nanjing, saying that if Japan is truly concerned about the safety of non-combatants, it should not bomb Nanjing, because Nanjing is a city without fortifications. Fortunately, only the American ambassador was intimidated and left Nanjing. The remaining ambassadors and warships in Nanjing can protect the defenseless civilians. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Washington Star Regrets Ambassador Johnson's Actions</h3>
<p>[Washington] The Star commented today on the evacuation of the American ambassador from Nanjing, saying that anyone who knows Ambassador Johnson's character will know that the ambassador took this action with unease. Ambassador Johnson is an experienced diplomat, and we understand that his actions are entirely driven by his duty. This dishonorable retreat is a disgrace. Washington should be held fully responsible. This matter was carried out under threat. At the same time, other countries have decided to remain in Nanjing, which makes the United States' actions even more embarrassing. The newspaper then listed examples of American diplomats who died in the line of duty during turbulent times, saying that the monument in the State Department lists no fewer than sixty-five diplomats and consuls who died in tragic circumstances. Ambassador Johnson has a reputation in foreign circles, but unfortunately obeyed semi-covert instructions, which has stained the glory of the martyrs of the diplomatic world. It is a pity.

<h3>The Enemy Retreats Two Kilometers on the Liu Hang Line</h3>
<p>The center of the war is now trending towards the Liu Hang line. The previous morning (the 21st) at 3:00 AM, the enemy first used many artillery pieces to continuously bombard the vicinity of my Jifu Bridge. Over several hours, they fired thousands of shells. We firmly defended our position and maintained strict vigilance. At dawn, we suddenly saw enemy infantry moving in front of our position. Our army jumped out of the trenches and advanced to meet them. The enemy responded in a panic and fought hand-to-hand many times, gradually becoming unable to withstand it, and retreated about two kilometers away. In this battle, we suffered dozens of casualties, while the enemy suffered twice as many.</p>
<p>Bloody Battles in the Sha Jing and Pan Jing Areas</p>
<p>Yesterday's main battles were in the Shapu and Pan Jing areas of Gujia Town. Our army was based north of the (east-west) county road, relying on the Gu Lu road to firmly defend the first line of defense. At about 6:00 AM, the enemy used two regiments of troops, covered by tanks, and advanced westward from Yang Hang, attacking our positions in the Yong'an Bridge, Yonglong Bridge, Huang Xiaozhai, Shi Yujiao, and Qinjiatang areas in the 46th district of the Shapu district. Our army bravely attacked and fought fiercely, driving the enemy back two kilometers away by 2:00 PM. Our army advanced to Changbang.</p>
<p>The Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses in Zhang Zhai and Meng Wan</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM the previous morning, more than 20 enemy planes circled and scouted over our You Meizhai position, followed by bombing. At the same time, their artillery also began to operate, bombarding us. Our army suffered very little damage. Until about 7:00 or 8:00 PM, the enemy army, heading straight for our Zhang Zhai line, began to launch a fierce attack on us. The artillery fire was extremely fierce, and tanks also covered their infantry charge. Our army rose up to meet them and did not show any fear, engaging with them. Eventually, because the Zhang Zhai position was too protruding and was attacked on three sides, it was not easy to defend. The fighting continued until about 12:00 AM. Our fresh troops arrived, and the bloody battle began again. Until yesterday morning, we were still engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy in the Yang Jiufang and Wang Jiufang areas. At 1:00 AM the night before, in the Meng Wan area, enemy artillery fire also fiercely attacked our position, and infantry also attempted to advance. Our army bravely resisted, and the enemy did not succeed. Until about 2:00 AM, the enemy suffered too many casualties and could not withstand it and collapsed.</p>
<p>An Entire Enemy Battalion Surrenders</p>
<p>The news from the battlefield yesterday morning is as follows: ㊀ The fighting along the Liu Hang to Gujiazhai line has been very fierce in recent days. The previous night, our artillery positions fiercely bombarded Yang Hang from 2:00 AM to 9:00 PM, firing more than a thousand shells. The enemy's line was destroyed by us and showed signs of retreating. The enemy army in that area has built artillery fortifications and also bombards us fiercely every day, but their targets are not as accurate as our army, so we have not suffered much damage. ㊁ As of 4:30 AM yesterday morning, we had advanced three or four li from Liu Hang to Yanghong Bridge and the nearby Gaojia Bridge and Sujiazhai, and were firmly defending along the river. The enemy did not dare to cross the river, which was about seventy or eighty meters away. ㊂ On the night of the 20th, when the enemy launched a major attack near Liu Hang, our rear reinforcements arrived continuously and attacked in droves. After about an hour, the enemy could not withstand it and retreated in succession. Finally, an entire battalion, about a company, was cut off from their retreat, surrounded on three sides, and surrendered completely. We seized more than 400 rifles, more than 10 machine guns and small cannons. Among the prisoners, we found that the enemy's organization was 24 people per squad, with the squad leader, deputy squad leader, and two first-class soldiers being Japanese, and three, four, six, or seven people per squad being from the Northeast. Since the enemy's defeat in this battle, they have not dared to advance lightly for two days. The villagers in the Liu Hang area have long since dispersed. The remaining people, except for the extremely poor, old, and weak, are not good people. Recently, we cracked two major dens, detaining more than 60 people, who all confessed without being beaten.</p>
<h3>The Enemy in Luodian Attacks in Multiple Directions</h3>
<p>The enemy in Luodian began their fourth attack on us the night before last (the 21st). They continuously attacked our front-line positions with small units. Our army calmly responded. At the same time, on our left flank, the Sucun line, the enemy also attacked in two directions, with about 500 to 600 people north of Sucun and about 1,000 people south of Sucun. We have stationed heavy troops there, who are engaging them in separate battles. The fierce fighting continued until yesterday morning and is still at a stalemate.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Army Repeatedly Attacks Our Jiangwan</h3>
<p>The enemy army first attempted a central breakthrough in Luodian and Yanghang, but was met with a head-on blow from our army and failed. The enemy then changed its strategy, concentrating its firepower in the downtown area, attempting to break through our Jiangwan line. Since the night before last (the 21st), they have repeatedly launched fierce attacks on our forward defense line in front of Jiangwan Town, but were bravely repelled by our army. As of yesterday morning, the enemy had not succeeded.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Army Bombed All Night the Night Before</h3>
<p>The enemy army's artillery and enemy ships in the Huangpu River, from Yangshupu and the downtown area, bombarded our positions in Pudong, Jiangwan, and Dachang the night before, and the sound of artillery was especially dense at midnight, like drums. It stopped only yesterday morning, but our front-line fortifications suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Flew Out to Bomb Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>At about 7:00 AM yesterday morning, an enemy plane circled and scouted over Beixinjing, and then dropped a bomb, which landed on an open space in the nearby Li Jiazhai, creating a deep pit. Although the sound shook the roofs, there was no loss. Also, in Minhang, in the southern suburbs, two enemy planes flew low to scout at 6:00 AM yesterday morning, circling for about ten minutes before flying west.</p>
<p>At about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, two enemy heavy bombers circled and scouted over Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai, and then dropped a bomb, which landed on a wasteland near the No. 1 Bridge on Zhongshan Road. At that time, a villager was seriously injured and was rescued and sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>From 8:00 AM yesterday morning, two enemy planes flew from the Pudong area to scout again, and then flew low, strafing people on the road with machine guns, flying from Lujiazui to the South Wharf of Tangqiao in Yangjiadu, crossing the Huangpu River to scout in the Nanshi area, and then returning along the original route. At the same time, they also distributed absurd leaflets.</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM, the enemy's airport in Yangshupu was extremely busy, with planes taking off and arriving from time to time. When enemy planes flew over Pudong, they were attacked by anti-aircraft guns near □□□□.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, three enemy planes circled over the Zhabei, Pengpu, and Miaohang areas, and dropped several bombs, all of which landed in the fields. Although several exploded, we suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Enemy Motorboats Patrolled the Huangpu River Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a motorboat carrying more than 20 enemy soldiers patrolled the Huangpu River off Lujiazui in Pudong. Then, at 3:15 PM and 4:00 PM, they twice strafed the Chunjiang Wharf with machine guns, seemingly probing our defenses and attempting to land. However, because our army's defenses were tight, they left in disappointment.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Continues to Reinforce, and Part of Their Forces Have Been Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>One Division and One Brigade, totaling about 40,000 Men</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that it has been 40 days since the enemy invaded Shanghai. Not only has there been no progress, but they have also repeatedly been met with strong resistance from our army. The total number of casualties, including regular troops, as well as Taiwanese troops, Korean troops, and puppet Manchukuo troops, is around 20,000. Therefore, in order to actively replenish their forces, so that they can come to invade us again, the enemy continues to ask for reinforcements from their country. Currently, one division and one brigade of their reinforcements, totaling about 40,000 men, part of which has already been transported to Shanghai by three enemy cruisers and multiple transport ships. The cruisers are still anchored outside Wusong, attempting to land at various ports along the Yangtze River. As for the Huangpu River, at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning (the 22nd), two enemy transport ships, No. 286, the Moriaoka Maru, and No. 224, the Toyokawa Maru, sailed in and docked at the Osaka and Huangpu wharves. About 4,000 enemy reinforcements wearing yellow uniforms landed and boarded 80 to 90 trucks parked on the wharf, heading for the Hongkou area.</p>
<h3>Enemy Transport Ships Have All Sailed Out Yesterday</h3>
<p>The enemy transport ships Moriaoka Maru and Toyokawa Maru, which transported about 4,000 men, part of the enemy's fourth wave of reinforcements, docked at the Osaka and Huangpu wharves yesterday morning, respectively, and after disembarking the reinforcements they were carrying, successively sailed out of the Songkou port yesterday afternoon at about 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM to return to Japan. When the two ships left the dock, the enemy transport ship Chida Maru, which had transported munitions to Shanghai the day before, also sailed out of Songkou port to return to Japan at about 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. According to a reporter's investigation at 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon, there were no enemy transport ships left in the Huangpu River, and they had all sailed out.</p>
<h3>Seventeen Enemy Warships in the Huangpu River Yesterday</h3>
<p>There were 22 enemy warships in the Huangpu River yesterday morning. Later, three enemy transport ships and two gunboats successively sailed out, so only seven ships were left in the Huangpu River yesterday afternoon. Their distribution is as follows: one destroyer No. 11 at the Mitsubishi Wharf, and one destroyer each at floating docks No. 40, No. 37, No. 36, No. 15, No. 8, No. 3, and No. 1, one gunboat each at floating docks No. 30, No. 27, No. 22, No. 16, and No. 13, two gunboats at floating dock No. 11, one flagship Izumo at floating dock No. 2, and one gunboat off the Bund in Nanjing Road. In total, there were eight destroyers, eight gunboats, and one cruiser, the Izumo, for a total of seventeen ships.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Shameless Propaganda Broadcasts</h3>
<p>During a war between two countries, it is sometimes inevitable to exaggerate the victories of one's own troops. However, to fabricate news to deceive the public is extremely base and shameless. Currently, a broadcaster at a certain Japanese radio broadcasting station in this city is broadcasting to listeners in fluent Chinese, saying that according to eyewitnesses of the air battle in Nanjing, the buildings of all administrative organs in Nanjing, except for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were burned down by Japanese aircraft bombs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was also almost hit. Nanjing has been reduced to a scorched earth. Fires are raging everywhere. The surviving residents are fleeing to the countryside. The Japanese aircraft bombs have leveled the capital of China, etc. In the afternoon, our military spokesman met with foreign reporters and mentioned this matter, saying, "I would deny this kind of unfounded talk, but I am afraid of polluting the ears of everyone present. I sincerely admire the enemy's ability to fabricate news." The news of Beijing and Shanghai can arrive in an instant. Under the public's eyes, the Japanese still make such shameless propaganda. No wonder they boast every day in their own country about the victories of the Japanese army in China, using this to deceive the people. It is pitiful that the Japanese civilians listen to the ravings of their warlords every day, and still believe it to be true.</p>
<h3>British Sailors Express Sympathy for Us</h3>
<p>The English-language China Press reported that, according to a telegram from the Chinese side in Hong Kong today (the 22nd), three British sailors on a Greek cargo ship carrying coal to Japan informed the captain on the morning of the 20th that they expressed sympathy for China and requested permission to leave the ship. The captain refused. The three then jumped into the sea, swam ashore, and landed.</p>
<h3>More Than 400 Overseas Chinese in Japan Return Home</h3>
<p>Departing from Kobe tonight, arriving in Shanghai on the morning of the 26th</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, many of our overseas Chinese compatriots in Japan have returned to China one after another. Yesterday, it was heard that the British Swire Company's Xinjiang ship, carrying goods from Hong Kong, arrived in Kobe. The Chinese Association negotiated and chartered it to carry more than 400 of our overseas Chinese compatriots back to China. They are scheduled to depart from Kobe tonight (the 23rd) and arrive on the morning of the 26th. Among them, overseas Chinese from Zhejiang will still take the original ship to Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Group Representatives Going to the Rear Should Have Official Documents as Proof</h3>
<p>Must Bring Sufficient Travel Expenses and Must Not Take Photos Along the Way</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau announced yesterday that "according to the special decree No. 1145 of the municipal government, it is stated that 'according to the secret political telegram from Commander-in-Chief Zhang, it is found that in recent times, cultural circles and mass organizations in Shanghai often send young men and women to the rear to carry out activities in the name of drama propaganda. Their enthusiasm for patriotism is commendable. However, when they come, they do not have formal official documents from the local government or competent authorities, and they carry cameras and survey forms, etc., which inevitably causes misunderstandings from county regiments and police. Moreover, they often stay in one place for many days without sufficient travel expenses, and are supported by the local government, which is especially troublesome. If restrictions are not imposed, it will inevitably lead to abuses. It is proposed that you quickly instruct your municipal competent authorities and the Anti-Japanese Support Association to pay attention to this. In the future, if there are any of the above-mentioned organizations, they must submit it to the competent authority for approval, carry formal letters of introduction, bring sufficient travel expenses, and must not take photos along the way or engage in other inappropriate actions, so as to prove their identity and prevent abuses. This is what we hope for.' Therefore, we hereby urgently announce that all cultural organizations and mass organizations in this city must comply. This announcement is made on September 22nd, 26th year of the Republic of China, Director Pan Gongzhan."</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants' Goods in the War Zone Have Been Approved for Removal</h3>
<p>Open for One Day Today</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas fell into the line of fire. Many goods from foreign merchants' firms were piled up in the wharves, warehouses, factories, and warehouses in the area, including wool fabrics, daily food, and various raw material medicines, all of which were of great value. However, due to the impact of the war, they could not be taken out. Although foreign merchants repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese military authorities, requesting permission to move out of the war zone, they were rejected and could not be accommodated. Because the war has gradually shifted outwards in recent days, the eastern Shanghai area is relatively calm. Therefore, the consulates and the Municipal Council, on behalf of the foreign merchants, negotiated with the Japanese side again. After much effort, the Japanese side finally agreed to open for one day on September 23rd, allowing foreign merchants to move the goods stored in the war zone out of the country. However, they must first apply to the Japanese military headquarters. The application form should also specify the quantity, name, value, and storage location of the goods to be moved, and where they will be transported for storage. It must also be accompanied by a certificate from the consulate of the country. If the Japanese side believes that there is something inappropriate, they may refuse the application. When moving the goods, the Municipal Council should accompany them. The Japanese side will not be responsible for any losses.</p>
<h3>Foreign Nationals from Moganshan Arrive in Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>About 150 American nationals, along with a small number of British and German nationals from Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places who went to Moganshan to take refuge, followed the original plan and took a special car prepared by the Zhejiang Provincial Government from Moganshan at 7:30 AM yesterday morning, passing through Hangzhou. After arriving in Ningbo that day, they took the British ship New Beijing to Shanghai and are expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Battalion Commander Yin Wounded and Killed Enemies in the Battle of Mengzhuang</h3>
<p>Still Waving His Arm Forward After Being Shot, Rejoined the Battle After Bandaging Without Wanting Medical Treatment</p>
<p>At 7:00 PM on the 20th, the enemy launched a counterattack against our army's position in Mengzhuang near Liuhang, concentrating heavy artillery fire to cover the infantry, which advanced very quickly. Battalion Commander Yin Jie (holding the rank of Major, from Suqian, Jiangsu Province) of the □ Battalion, who was defending the Mengzhuang position, led the soldiers of the entire battalion to calmly respond to the enemy. The enemy's infantry, having the advantage of heavy artillery cover, gradually approached our army's trenches. Battalion Commander Yin saw that the situation was critical and gave the order to charge out of the trenches and engage in melee combat. At the sound of the order, all the soldiers of the battalion jumped out in response, their bayonets gleaming like snow, and fiercely attacked the enemy. Battalion Commander Yin took the lead, charging forward with his Mauser pistol, fiercely attacking the enemy. In the blink of an eye, a stray bullet flew over and hit Battalion Commander Yin in the arm. Even after being shot, Battalion Commander Yin continued to wave his arm forward, using the Mauser pistol he was holding to fiercely attack the enemy. The soldiers of the entire battalion were greatly inspired, and eventually killed many of the enemy's counterattacking infantry, causing the enemy to retreat in a panic. Our army's Mengzhuang position was finally preserved. When the reinforcements arrived, they saw that Battalion Commander Yin had been wounded and immediately summoned Gu Xiangsheng and Shan Shufang, two members of the sixth team of the Chinese Red Cross rescue team, which was newly organized by the August 13th National Salvation Association and was serving in the battlefield. They intended to rescue Battalion Commander Yin and take him to the rear for treatment. However, Battalion Commander Yin said that the wound on his arm was very minor and that he was willing to rejoin the battle after bandaging it and did not want to go to the rear for treatment. In the end, he firmly refused to board the ambulance and leave the position he was defending.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Safety Issues</h3>
<p>— A Special Correspondent</p>
<p>The *North China Daily News* carried a short commentary yesterday, discussing the situation of Nanshi, stating that the Japanese authorities are now focusing their attention on Nanshi. It is said that the Nanshi area is currently used for military purposes, and that aircraft may return to the area. This warning is worth considering. Thinking of conducting aerial bombardments on a city with a very large population is extremely disturbing. Although Shanghai has now been drawn into the vortex of a new era of war, the potential destruction of a city like Nanshi is particularly cruel and heartless. The declaration by the Japanese authorities implies that they are concerned about humanity. The Japanese authorities have stated that they do not want to trap civilians in the tragedy of aerial bombardment. The Chinese authorities responsible for the safety of Nanshi should investigate whether they can give guarantees to the Japanese side, clarifying that Nanshi is indeed not being used for military purposes. This swift action may stir the Japanese people's desire to avoid harming civilians. If this cannot be achieved, it can at least prove that the responsible Chinese authorities have taken appropriate measures to eliminate any excuse for Japanese aircraft to bomb densely populated cities. According to the translator, although war is a fierce affair, it should still be conducted in accordance with humanitarian rules. Therefore, captured enemies should be properly accommodated, and the wounded should be allowed to return home. If the two countries are unfortunately defeated and meet with weapons, there will eventually be a day when they will release their disputes and make peace. The European War lasted for more than four years before finally coming to an end. That is, there will be an end to the victory or defeat of the war, even if the victor should stop at the right time and not be too extreme. In recent years, there has been a strong reaction in Germany against the victorious countries of the European War. General commentators attribute this to the harsh conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, which is a sincere argument. Therefore, even if the purpose of war is to kill the enemy and achieve results, actions that violate humanity should still be avoided. It is hoped that on the day of peace restoration, old hatreds will be eliminated and trade will be as usual. During the European War, the German ship *Emden* destroyed dozens of enemy ships, but its captain never harmed the non-combatant members of the ships. When the *Emden* encountered the Australian ship *Sydney* and was sunk, the captain was taken prisoner, and the enemies regarded him as a hero and paid him respect because he respected humanity during the war. After the war, Germany built another ship and named it *Emden* to commemorate the forgotten. The zero-items that people took from the original *Emden* ship as souvenirs when it was sunk, such as the steel plate engraved with the ship's name, the bronze bell for summoning soldiers, the wooden box for placing mail, and other trivial items, were all returned to the new *Emden* by the collectors to express their admiration for the old captain. From this, it can be seen that those who respect humanity during wartime are also respected by others, and justice will not be extinct in the world. However, this time, Japan is carrying out an invasive war against our country, acting perversely and doing everything possible, disregarding international law, trampling on humanitarianism, bombing hospitals and refugees, and even affecting the Red Cross ambulances. Now, it is even more unscrupulous to carry out large-scale air raids on our capital. As Soviet Foreign Commissioner Litvinov said, "The most barbaric of all the ideals that the dark ages have long since eliminated are now being revived by the aggressor countries." The *North China Daily News* reporter now hopes for the safety of the lives of the residents of Nanshi and has written this short article to contribute his opinion. The words of a benevolent person do not lose the demeanor of a British gentleman. However, the fact that Nanshi has no military installations and is not used for military purposes is obvious and undoubtedly true. This can be evidenced by the fact that Japanese aircraft have repeatedly flown low over the skies of Nanshi without being attacked by machine guns or anti-aircraft guns. The Japanese military authorities deliberately intend to destroy our Nanshi in order to vent their anger at their defeat in the Battle of Shanghai. They are using the excuse that troops are stationed in Nanshi to cover up their crimes. How can this be stopped by a guarantee issued by the Chinese authorities? Just as the Japanese aircraft threatened to launch a large-scale air raid on our headquarters, even after protests from ambassadors from various countries to Japan, they still disregarded public opinion and finally realized it yesterday. Therefore, if Japanese aircraft want to bomb Nanshi, they can only be allowed to bomb it. The result is nothing more than the destruction of a certain number of houses and the death or injury of a certain number of innocent civilians, without obtaining the slightest military benefit. And it will be as the *North China Daily News* reporter said a few days ago, "It will create a spiritual resistance in the souls of the Chinese people that can never be erased." It is said, "Those who do many unjust things will destroy themselves." The Buddhist scriptures say that those who sow the seeds must reap the consequences themselves. For every innocent civilian killed by the Japanese, the number of active anti-Japanese elements increases by a certain number. If one person in a family dies at the hands of the Japanese, the surviving members of the family will firmly remember this hatred and never forget it. This is not comparable to soldiers who die on the battlefield without complaint. Furthermore, the translator has some humble opinions that he would like to offer to the compatriots of the whole country. Japanese aircraft are now rampant everywhere, routinely choosing prosperous markets to throw bombs. In my humble opinion, wherever Japanese aircraft drop bombs in non-military areas, the government should choose one of them, preserve the state of destruction after the bombing, and not repair it. After the war ends in the future, investigate the details of the damage suffered locally, and erect a monument next to it, writing in large letters, "In the 26th year of the Republic of China, Japan launched an invasive war against our country. Its aircraft bombed this city or city × times, destroying ×× houses, killing ×× people, and injuring ×× people. This monument is erected to commemorate it forever." It is passed down to future generations to expose the barbaric actions of the bandits, and officials are warned to know that only after national defense is strengthened can families be safe and bodies be safe.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Aircraft Invading South China Suffered Extremely Heavy Casualties</h3>
<p>The enemy claims that 58 officers were killed in action.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy's naval aircraft have been wreaking havoc in the South China area for days. After a severe blow by our air force, they suffered heavy casualties. It was learned that at 3:00 p.m. on the 21st, Tokyo broadcasted a report saying, "The remains of 58 naval officers, including Major Yoshida, who died in the bombing of South China, arrived at Yokosuka Naval Port today." According to the enemy's reports on military casualties, they have always adopted a strategy of concealment. This time, they claimed that the remains of 58 air force officers and officers who died in action were recovered. The number of enemy aircraft destroyed in our positions must be far more than this. It can be seen that the enemy aircraft invading South China suffered extremely heavy casualties.</p>
<h3>The National Postal Union Sends a Telegram to Traffic Workers Across the Country to Resist the Enemy</h3>
<p>Work together to maintain traffic, actively subscribe to public bonds, and strictly prevent traitor activities.</p>
<p>To all press organizations forwarding to seafarers, railways, postal services, telecommunications, maritime, and other trade unions, as well as traffic workers nationwide: The Japanese bandits are jumping beams and repeatedly showing their rebellious flames. Recently, they have again used troops to cause trouble, occupying our Tianjin and Shanghai, destroying our culture, and abusing and killing our people. Their cruelty is unprecedented. All those with blood and breath are furious. Fortunately, our loyal and brave soldiers at the front have stepped forward one after another, fighting regardless of their own safety, and have been able to thwart the enemy's edge, trap the enemy in their positions, and kill tens of thousands of thieves and prisoners, giving the violent enemy a heavy blow. However, although the enemy's edge has been thwarted, the enemy's heart has not died. To seek final victory, we must rely on a long-term war of resistance. To seek a long-term war of resistance, we must rely on cooperation between the military and civilians. Now that our loyal and brave soldiers are bravely driving on the front line, how can patriotic people linger in the rear? All nationals, rise up to kill the enemy, and there is no turning back. We are ordered by the state to be in charge of transportation. During this period of resistance, in addition to maintaining transportation and being loyal to our duties, we also often plan to mobilize workers across the country to engage in salvation work. Whether it is donating money or donating effort, we should do our best, embrace the determination to sacrifice, and act as a backing for resisting the enemy. This is one. Traitor activities are a major obstacle to the war of resistance. It is not uncommon for some people to use transportation tools to engage in treasonous activities to communicate with the enemy. Our transportation workers are spread all over the country and should be vigilant and report them at any time and place, striving to eliminate them completely and remove an obstacle to the future of the war of resistance. This is two. The government issues national salvation bonds to replenish the strength of the war of resistance. The number of traffic workers is the largest, so they should take the lead in subscribing and advocating for the working class. This is three. The above three points are all our responsibilities, and they are easy to do. It is hoped that the workers across the country will rise up together, practice them personally, and the future of the country will depend on them. Respectfully, the National Postal Workers' Union of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Recent Activities of Women's Comfort Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Women's Comfort Association for Soldiers in the War of Resistance has been working very hard recently. It is reported that it has recently issued 1,361 comfort bags, distributed to the Jinghu Garrison Command Office, the Su-Zhe Border Area Director's Office, and the wounded soldiers at the front and the returning wounded soldiers. It has also issued 189 cotton quilts, distributed to the Seventh Rescue Team, the Su-Zhe Border Area Director's Office, and General Commander Zhang Zhizhong, as well as ×× General Commander and ××× Military Commander, etc., asking them to distribute them on their behalf. As for the comfort methods, there are two types: ㊀ The comfort group of the association directly comforts them; ㊁ The offices stationed in Shanghai come to the association to receive them. The objects of comfort are not only the anti-Japanese soldiers in Shanghai, but also the North China area. Ms. He Xiangning once specially sent Ms. Hu Lanqi as a representative to carry items to Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, Song Meiling, to be forwarded to the north, and also exchanged cash to Yan Xishan and Tang Enbo for 300 yuan each, asking them to purchase and distribute the items actually needed by the soldiers in their areas to show their comfort for the soldiers in the war of resistance.</p>

This has such an important meaning for the future of our great Chinese nation. Because everyone knows that in the face of the imminent crisis of national life, only the unity within our nation can defeat the aggression of Japanese imperialism. Now that the foundation for the unity of the whole nation has been laid, the prerequisites for the independence, freedom, and liberation of our nation have also been created. The CPC Central Committee specially congratulates our nation on its bright future. However, we know that to turn this bright future of the nation into a new China of independent freedom and happiness in reality, every passionate descendant of the Yellow Emperor in the country still needs to make unremitting efforts and struggles. The Communist Party of China is willing to take this opportunity to put forward to the compatriots of the whole country the goals of our struggle, which are: ㊀ Strive for the independence, freedom, and liberation of the Chinese nation. First of all, we must earnestly and quickly prepare and launch a national revolutionary war of resistance to recover lost land and restore the integrity of the sovereign territory. ㊁ Realize civil rights politics and open a national assembly to formulate a constitution and stipulate national education policies. ㊂ Realize the happiness and pleasant life of the Chinese people. First of all, we must earnestly provide disaster relief, stabilize people's livelihoods, develop national defense economy, relieve people's suffering, and improve people's lives. All of these are urgently needed in China. With this as the goal of our struggle, we believe that we will definitely win the enthusiastic support of the compatriots of the whole country. The CPC is willing to work together with the compatriots of the whole country under this general goal. The CPC deeply knows that on the road to realizing this lofty goal, it is necessary to overcome many obstacles and difficulties. First of all, we will encounter the obstruction and destruction of Japanese imperialism. In order to eliminate the enemy's pretext for conspiracy and to dispel the misunderstandings of all well-intentioned skeptics, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China must express its sincerity for the cause of national liberation. Therefore, the CPC Central Committee once again announces to the country: ㊀ Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles are necessary for China today. Our party is willing to strive for its thorough realization. ㊁ Abolish all policies of violent uprisings and red movements to overthrow the government of the Chinese Kuomintang, and stop the policy of confiscating landlords' land by violence. ㊂ Abolish the current Soviet government, implement civil rights politics to unify the national regime. ㊃ Abolish the title and number of the Red Army, reorganize it into the National Revolutionary Army, and be under the command of the Military Commission of the National Government, and stand by for orders to take on the responsibilities of the front line of the war of resistance. Dear compatriots, our party's bright, open, selfless, and accommodating attitude has long been clearly expressed to the compatriots of the whole country in words and deeds, and has long been approved by our compatriots. Now, in order to achieve sincere unity with the Chinese Kuomintang, consolidate the national peace and unification, and carry out the sacred national revolutionary war, we are prepared to immediately implement the parts of these promises that have not yet been implemented in form, such as the abolition of the Soviet area and the reorganization of the Red Army, so as to use the unified and united national strength to resist the invasion of the strong enemy. The bandits are deep, and the disaster is urgent. Compatriots, rise up, let the 400 million compatriots of the whole country unite more closely. Our great and long-standing nation is invincible. Rise up to consolidate national unity, to overthrow the oppression of Japanese imperialism, and victory belongs to our Chinese nation. Long live the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan! Long live the new China of independent freedom and happiness! Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (Central News Agency telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<p>[London] British companies with interests in China held a meeting here this afternoon and decided on the following four measures: ㊀ Require insurance companies to underwrite military insurance for goods transported by the Guangdong-Hankou Railway in China. ㊁ If ships carrying goods to China have to unload their goods in ports in other countries in the Far East due to time constraints, the dock fees to be paid should be guaranteed by the British Consulates in those ports. ㊂ Present a statement to the Foreign Office and submit a request to the Japanese government so that the goods stored by the British within the Japanese defense lines in Hongkou and Yangshupu in Shanghai can be transported out. ㊃ Organize two specialized committees to preside over trade with China, one representing importers and the other representing exporters, so as to closely monitor the evolution of the Far Eastern situation and take various practical and effective actions to deal with it. In addition, the British Federation of Industries has scheduled to convene a joint meeting of representatives of the companies attending the conference and the London China Association on the 29th of this month to study in detail the various issues discussed today and to discuss measures to protect all British interests in China.

<p>[London] The United Kingdom may inquire with the United States government within the next few days about what kind of reaction the United States will have if the United Kingdom recalls its ambassador to Japan. Although the British Foreign Office has not made any statement, it can be seen that the government considers the Sino-Japanese War to be increasingly serious. According to those close to Foreign Secretary Eden, Eden is well aware that if Japan does bomb Nanjing, the United Kingdom may have no choice but to make a final decision on Anglo-Japanese relations. London is very willing to have close cooperation with the United States, so British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, will not take any action until the opinion of the United States has been obtained. At the same time, observers also believe that if the British government is not satisfied with the Japanese government's reply regarding the injury of the British Ambassador to China, the Foreign Office may recall the ambassador to Japan. However, diplomatic authorities also admit that the United States has no hope of recalling Ambassador Grew. (Riot Min telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Advisory Committee Invites China and Japan to Attend</h3>
<p>Also Invites Germany and Australia to Participate; Re-opening Next Monday</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Sino-Japanese Problem Advisory Committee of the League of Nations Assembly held a meeting on the evening of the 21st, and immediately elected Latvian Foreign Minister Munters as chairman. British representative Cramp and French representative Thellier then suggested to the committee to invite representatives from China, Japan, Germany, and Australia to participate, which was approved by the committee. The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for the 27th of this month. Soviet representative Litvinov proposed that if replies from various countries could be received before the scheduled meeting, the committee might as well convene earlier, which was also approved by the committee. (Central News Agency dispatch from Geneva, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Geneva] China's written statement of appeal has been submitted to the League of Nations Advisory Committee. However, the committee is currently only discussing procedural matters. All twenty-three members, including American Minister to Switzerland Harrison, were present. Written invitations were sent to China, Japan, Germany, and Australia, requesting replies within three days. It was also decided that committee meetings would not be open to the public. As soon as replies are received, a second meeting will be held, no later than next Monday. Dutch representative Graeff stated that due to the geographical situation of Dutch colonies, he did not wish to continue as chairman, and Latvian Foreign Minister Munters was elected as chairman. At the same time, the Chinese government suggested to the League of Nations that in the current environment, China could not implement a formal technical cooperation plan with the League of Nations, but China hoped that the League of Nations would assist in general relief for civilians and refugees, and in the work of epidemic prevention. (Reuters dispatch from Geneva, 21st)</p>
<p>[Geneva] A Havas correspondent recently learned that China will accept the invitation to participate in the work of the Advisory Committee, while Japan will definitely refuse, and will explain the reasons for the refusal. Currently, the Japanese government is quite uneasy about the League of Nations interfering in the disputes between China and Japan. This can be seen from the vigorous activities of Japanese observers currently in Geneva. The Advisory Committee was originally composed of France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, the United States, the Soviet Union, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Turkey, Hungary, Portugal, Ireland, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, Panama, and Canada. Among them, Germany has already withdrawn from the League of Nations, so it must be invited. As for inviting Australia, it was advocated by the United Kingdom, whose intention was to prove that the policy pursued by the United Kingdom in the Far East is based on the connection of the various dominions of the British Empire in spirit. Some people recently believed that Australia, being very worried about Japan's ambitiousness in the Pacific, urgently wants to shift Japan's attention, so that it will focus on China. Therefore, after Australia joins the Advisory Committee, it will naturally advocate that the committee adopt a moderate attitude towards Japan. People in the League of Nations, however, believe that Australia and other British dominions have always adhered to the League of Nations Covenant, and believe that the unity of the British Empire always takes the Covenant as the most reliable guarantee, and there will be no other intentions.

<h3>Italy Agrees to Participate in Nyon Agreement, Mediterranean Situation Eases</h3>
<p>British, French, and Italian Experts to Meet in Paris to Discuss How Italian Warships Will Participate in Surveillance</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the issue of Italy's participation in the Mediterranean surveillance plan, French Foreign Minister Thellier, Chairman of the Nyon Conference, after meeting with British Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday, proposed convening naval experts from Britain, France, and Italy to hold a meeting in Paris on the 27th of this month, in order to determine the conditions for Italy's participation in the surveillance. Generally, Italian warships will no longer conduct surveillance alone in the originally designated area, the Mauretanian Sea, but will jointly conduct surveillance throughout the Mediterranean with British and French destroyer fleets. People in the League of Nations are extremely pleased with the smooth progress of negotiations among the countries concerned. (Havas dispatch from Geneva, 21st)</p>
<p>[Rome] After the British and French chargés d'affaires held further talks with Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano regarding the Mediterranean surveillance plan, Italy has practically accepted participation. According to an official communiqué, the British and French representatives declared to Foreign Minister Ciano this morning that their countries have always regarded Italy as a major power in the Mediterranean, and would never discriminate against it. They also suggested to the Foreign Minister that a meeting of naval experts from Britain, France, and Italy be convened in Paris in the near future, in order to determine the conditions for Italy's participation in the surveillance. The Foreign Minister immediately accepted and has informed Germany of the negotiations. Responsible officials here have also declared that regarding Italy's participation in the surveillance, the political issues have been resolved because the British and French chargés d'affaires have declared their recognition of Italy's equal status. Now, only the naval experts from Britain, France, and Italy need to discuss various technical issues, such as the number of Italian warships participating in the surveillance, the coordination of the British, French, and Italian fleets, etc., after which Italy can implement its participation. (Havas dispatch from Geneva, 21st)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the British and French proposal to invite Italy to participate in the Mediterranean surveillance system, local newspapers commented that this move would ease the European situation. Among them, the Berliner Tageblatt said that the invitation to Italy to participate in the Mediterranean surveillance by Britain and France is enough to avoid the current state of tension. This kind of tension is dangerous and unnecessary. The Berliner Mittag Zeitung said that this new proposal by Britain and France has brought about a favorable turning point in an important political and diplomatic event.

<h3>The Need for Overall Adjustment of Wartime Food Supplies</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai war has begun, various localities have made considerable arrangements for civilian food, such as the Civil Food Adjustment Committee in Shanghai, and the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Shanxi have also managed food supplies within their respective territories one after another. However, as the war is just beginning, the future disposition of civilian food should be deeply considered. Wartime transportation will inevitably have various obstacles and will not have the convenience of peacetime. In the past, rice-producing provinces were worried about low grain prices due to poor transportation. This year, there is a bumper harvest in many places, but the northern transportation route to Hebei has been blocked, making sales even more difficult. Even if foreign rice is used to supplement supplies, imports will also be affected. Therefore, the urgent task today is not to strictly prevent food from leaving the country, but to facilitate smooth domestic circulation; not to ensure sufficient food in a small area, but to adjust the supply and demand of food throughout the country; not to cause stagnation and harm to farmers, and not to cause imbalance and harm to the people. If this is done, more than half of the food problem will be solved.</p>
<p>The central government has already promulgated wartime food management regulations, but they have not yet been implemented. This is presumably because the matter is of great importance, and even if an agency is established without adequate preparation and necessary conditions, it will be difficult to achieve good results. However, if wartime food management is left to the localities to govern themselves, the malpractices will either become a disguised form of excessive taxation, or will cause the production and sales of grain to lose their flexibility. This can be seen from the recent incident in Changshu of detaining rice being transported to Shanghai. Even in Shanghai, which has historically had a good food supply, although it has sources of rice from Suzhou, Songjiang, Changshu, Wuxi, Chengjia, and other places, it still needs rice from Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi to adjust the supply. The extent of the need can be imagined. However, if there is no Shanghai market to absorb the surplus grain in various places, grain prices will inevitably fall sharply, and the farmers' economy will also be affected. This balancing of surplus and deficit is precisely to seek the evenness of grain production and sales. Furthermore, Guangdong Province has always been fond of foreign rice, but in the future, it may only be able to rely on domestic rice. Therefore, even in terms of rice alone, the situation is already very complicated. Without a comprehensive plan for production and sales, there will be those who only seek self-preservation, regardless of supply and demand, and those who use rice bans to raise funds. This will not only be useless for wartime civilian food, but will also increase difficulties. It is known that this kind of situation may not be discovered immediately, but if the management methods of various provinces and cities cannot be consistent, and there is a lack of contact between them, there will inevitably be many distortions between production and sales. Therefore, if representatives of food management agencies in various provinces and cities can be gathered together to present their opinions and methods on wartime food management, and a general rule for wartime food management in various provinces and cities can be negotiated and established, all procedures for buying, selling, purchasing, transportation, warehousing, and fund allocation, as well as their turnaround, convenience, and safety, can be comprehensively planned. In addition, if the exchange of food information, statistics on sales and existing grain, and investigation of production and improvement of production can be effectively carried out, it will not be difficult to achieve considerable results.</p>
<p>If the food problem can be solved through the cooperation of various provinces and cities, and improvements can be sought at any time, like the assistance of fingers and arms, it will not be long before the adjustment of food throughout the country will be roughly on a scale. When this is achieved, there will be sufficient food and troops, and victory can be ensured.</p>
<h3>Professors and Writers Association Announces Declaration of Establishing Wartime University</h3>
<p>Rebuilding the Foundation of Culture and Education from Scorched Earth; Taking the Last Lesson Amidst Aircraft and Artillery Bombardment</p>
<p>The Wartime Construction University (referred to as the Wartime University), prepared by the Wartime Cultural Construction Committee of the Shanghai Professors and Writers Association, is actively progressing and will soon be formally established. The sixth meeting was held yesterday afternoon and resolved to: ㊀ expand the organization of the Wartime University, selecting the current site of the University on Nanyang Road, No. 2 Jiaozhou Road as the second campus, and No. 1750 Xinzha Road as the third campus; ㊁ announce to professors and writers around the world the Japanese atrocities of destroying Chinese culture and the declaration of the establishment of the Wartime University; ㊂ formulate key proposals such as enrollment guidelines. The declaration of the establishment of the school is recorded as follows: The institutions of higher learning in our country are concentrated in Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, reaching half of the total number. However, the iron hooves of Japanese imperialism are relentlessly trampling on these school-filled Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. Their desire to destroy our cultural institutions and block our access to knowledge is self-evident. However, cultural and educational institutions are where the national spirit is entrusted. If the enemy can destroy them, and we cannot resist, then where shall we place ourselves? Therefore, even though the enemy is now bombing our cultural and educational institutions with aircraft and artillery, we must collect the ashes of the bombing at any time and in any place, and rebuild our cultural and educational undertakings from the scorched earth. Only then can we show that our culture has a foundation that cannot be destroyed by aircraft and artillery, and can maintain its lasting and unchanging development and growth even under the continuous destruction of aircraft and artillery. The members of this association, without considering their meager abilities, established the Wartime University, also to collect the ashes of the bombing and plan to rebuild the cultural and educational undertaking from the scorched earth. Since the purpose of the members is here, then the members should devote themselves to this arduous work with the spirit of dedicating themselves to culture, and dare to tell our countrymen three things. First, the university is named Wartime to show that it is an educational institution in extraordinary times. In ordinary times, universities should pay attention to both the equipment and facilities of the campus, but in extraordinary times, we can only make up for the lack of material with spirit. Any open space that can provide us with recreation is the campus of this university. Any place that can provide us with shelter is the classroom of this university. Anything that can arouse our national consciousness and the spirit of resistance is the library and laboratory of this university. We will build this university on the basis of exceeding material things with a transcendent spirit, and make this university a university where the entire national spirit and culture are entrusted. Second, since we have now launched a full-scale war of resistance, not only can we not give up the war of resistance while there is still a soldier and a bullet, but even if we can still take one last lesson, we must resolutely and resolutely take this last lesson. If we cannot have classes in the front, we will have them in the rear. If we cannot have classes in place A, we will have them in place B. We do not hesitate to make the school a mobile school, nor do we hesitate to make ourselves wandering educators. Third, we do not seek complete equipment and facilities for the campus, but we will strive to enrich the knowledge that we want to provide to the students, and we will strive to make the talents we want to cultivate practical, so as not to disappoint the great name of this Wartime University. Is this humble intention appropriate? If the domestic elite can offer guidance, then it would be fortunate indeed. This declaration is made with respect.</p>

<h3>Business Community Appeals for Donations to National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Full Team Discussion Meeting Proceeding According to Original Plan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Business Community Donation General Team for National Salvation Bonds held a full team discussion meeting yesterday afternoon. Over ninety people attended, including General Team Leader Wang Xiaolai and Deputy General Team Leader Du Yuesheng. First, General Team Leader Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, stating that the enemy's ambition to invade us is becoming increasingly exposed, and the residents of Shanghai can hear it more clearly. The enemy's artillery and aircraft cruelly inflict violence. Our soldiers in the front lines bravely resist the enemy, dedicating their last drop of blood to the country. Although our businessmen and civilians cannot die on the battlefield, they should also dedicate their last penny to the country. Judging from the situation in the past few weeks of the Shanghai war, the final victory will surely belong to us. Purchasing National Salvation Bonds is the best way for us to be loyal to the country. Therefore, I firmly believe that our businessmen and civilians will enthusiastically subscribe. Moreover, we should regard this subscription to National Salvation Bonds as a life-saving act. For example, if a person is in danger of life, they must not consider any sacrifice in order to maintain the continuation of life. Therefore, this time our businessmen and civilians should use this spirit to do their best to subscribe to these National Salvation Bonds. Subsequently, Deputy General Team Leader Du, General Secretary Luo, and the team members explained the significance and methods of this subscription to National Salvation Bonds. Finally, it was decided to proceed earnestly according to the established methods, and it is expected that its mission can be completed in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Chinese Customs Staff</p>
<p>Recently, the Chinese staff of the Jianghai Customs, led by senior Chinese staff such as Ding Guitang and Qiu Zhuoqi, launched a donation campaign to raise funds to purchase National Salvation Bonds. It is estimated that 100,000 yuan can be collected. It is also known that the Chinese staff have separately collected 15,000 yuan to donate to the Chinese Red Cross Society to assist in the expenses of rescuing wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>Cosmetics Industry</p>
<p>The Cosmetics Industry Association convened a meeting yesterday to raise funds for National Salvation Bonds.

Subscription methods were immediately decided, divided into salary deduction and free purchase. As for the staff of the Party Branch, the first batch has already subscribed 515 yuan.</p>
<h3>Father Zhao's Enthusiastic Relief Efforts for Refugees</h3>
<p>Hoping Enemy Won't Bomb Again; Enemy Has No Firm Reply</p>
<p>Father Zhao, a Frenchman who taught at Aurora University on Rue Lupan in the French Concession, risked danger during the January 28th Shanghai War, gathered his colleagues, and went to the war zone to rescue many refugees. This time, after the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, Father Zhao still gathered his colleagues, departed for the war zone to rescue wounded soldiers, sent them to various hospitals for treatment, and rescued refugees, sending them to various reception centers. Now, due to the congestion of refugees in the Concession, even after the various groups such as the Hometown Association have tried to send them away, they still come in an endless stream. The various reception centers are largely unable to accommodate them, and sending them away from Shanghai is still feared because enemy aircraft will bomb them, so there is a tendency to not dare to depart. Now it is heard that Father Zhao, in view of this, especially went to the Japanese Consulate and the Japanese Navy Commander Hasegawa, among others, together with the French Naval Commander stationed in Shanghai the other day, to request that they not bomb during the repatriation of refugees to their hometowns, so as not to harm innocent civilians, and proposed to designate a refugee reception area in a suitable location in the Nanshi area, dedicated to receiving refugees, and request that enemy aircraft not bomb it. However, because the Japanese military personnel in charge did not give a firm affirmative answer, there was no satisfactory result, but Father Zhao still possesses an indomitable spirit and plans to find a way to proceed again and is in the process of negotiating back and forth.</p>

It is reported that yesterday and the day before yesterday, people from all walks of life enthusiastically donated, and the results were very good.

<h3>Civil Food Regulation Association Again Calls for Lower Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Ample Harvest from Various Regions Arrives; Maximum Sales Price Limited to Fourteen Yuan</p>
<p>The Civil Food Regulation Association, in view of the fact that the early rice and mid-season rice crops have been bountiful this year in rice-producing areas across the country, and the late rice crop is also about to enter the market, with rice boats from various places arriving in Shanghai one after another, which is quite sufficient for the city's food supply, has issued a special announcement to further reduce the price of rice. Here is a special excerpt as follows: Announcement regarding the matter. Since the establishment of the association, it has made every effort to circulate food from various places, and the arrival of goods has gradually increased. Regarding the selling price, it should be appropriately reduced to alleviate the people's difficulties. This has been properly discussed at this meeting. From the 24th of this month, the highest selling price of first-class white japonica rice shall not exceed fourteen yuan. Medium and inferior grades shall be handled separately. Du Xian, Yang Xian, and Ke Xian rice shall remain the same. However, the price of white japonica rice distributed since the 22nd (yesterday) has been reduced by five jiao. This is a special announcement. Please be informed immediately. This is announced.</p>
<h3>Merchant Corps Russian Team Patrols</h3>
<p>Starting yesterday morning, the Russian team of the Public Concession Merchant Corps patrolled the streets at the intersections of Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Haig, and Avenue Foch (the section from the Bund to Route Dufour).</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that the Public Concession's Municipal Council is making every effort to maintain security within the concession. In addition to implementing martial law, it has also strengthened the security forces of its various departments. However, recently, incidents of theft, robbery, injury, and the unexplained disappearance of residents have occurred frequently within the concession. Therefore, the police authorities specially dispatched a Chinese detective and two Chinese constables, together with two members of the Merchant Corps, at around 8:00 am this morning to inspect cars traveling south at the intersections of the British and French Concession boundaries, such as Route Foch's Route Tenant de la Tour, Rue Molière, Seymour Road, and Weihaiwei Road, where the above-mentioned personnel were stationed to strictly inspect.</p>

<h3>Wang Xiaolai's Important Speech Hopes the United States Will Correct Its Attitude</h3>
<p>U.S. Naval Actions Show Unequal Treatment; Harmful to Sino-U.S. Friendship Relations</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, issued an important statement yesterday, saying that the two major republics of China and the United States are located in the eastern and western hemispheres, and are both peace-loving nations that uphold justice. For decades, they have maintained cordial relations. This time, China is resisting Japan in order to uphold peace and resist aggression. It is expected that the American people will be able to provide deep sympathy and moral assistance. Unexpectedly, when our country notified the embassies of various countries and informed their warships to avoid approaching Japanese warships, the United States refused, while Japan notified various countries that when foreign warships were moored upstream of Xiaguan on the Yangtze River, it would act accordingly on its own. Comparing the two, the difference is obvious. At the same time, the U.S. President issued an order banning the shipment of munitions to China and Japan, treating those who resist aggression and those who carry out aggression equally. No wonder the Washington Post also expressed its opposition to this ban. Regarding this action by the United States, we people recall the past friendly relations and feel infinitely regretful and indignant. We deeply hope that the American people will quickly take steps to correct this, so as to forever maintain the glorious history of the two great nations. Furthermore, our compatriots should also realize that to resist Japan and save the nation, we can only rely on our own strength. The Prime Minister instructed us to unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally and fight together. Examining the instructions carefully, we must first rely on our own strength in order to fight together with others. Secondly, only nations that truly treat us equally can unite with us. The facts are like this. May our compatriots always remember this teaching and work even harder.</p>
<h3>The Home Tutor Service Office Has Been Approved for Filing</h3>
<p>Entrance Examination Preparation Classes; All Have Guarantees</p>
<p>The Wartime Home Tutor Service Office of the China Special Education Association recently requested the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to file the record, and the bureau has ordered approval. The main subjects studied by students at home, as stipulated in the regulations, can be used for entrance examinations and class transfers. The Social Affairs Bureau only allows the association to handle this home education in order to ensure uniformity and facilitate supervision. The teacher application forms issued by the office have the seal of the Director, Pan Gongzhan, and the service office's official stamp for identification.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Sinister Arguments (II)</h3>
<p>— Lin Gengbai</p>
<p>In the midst of thorough resistance, we must guard against a group of quasi-traitors and "Japan experts" who, under the protection of urban financial capitalists and colonial capital forces that do not qualify as industrial capital, directly or indirectly advocate peace. Their claims are nothing more than two major reasons: one is to use the excuse that the sympathy of third countries should not be lost, and the other is to argue for the destruction of national capital. These both seem to be able to move people. As for whether the so-called sympathy of third countries is worth valuing, I have already answered that in the previous section. However, the latter statement is precisely the starting point for my advocacy of thorough resistance, because China's national capital is suppressed by imperialist capital and is very difficult to rise. This is also known to everyone. In particular, if Japanese imperialism is not eliminated one day, China's national capital will not be able to be built up one day. The low price of goods, unequal tariffs, close transportation, armed smuggling, and cooperation with traitors can all cause China's national capital to be exploited. Fortunately, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has not been realized. Otherwise, so-called cooperation would inevitably lead to the entire national capital of China being reduced to the status of a colonial capital of Japanese imperialism, becoming the second India in the East. Furthermore, the so-called national capital of China is mostly located in new-style cities, and the prosperity of new-style cities is precisely due to the power of imperialist capital. Therefore, the most prosperous cities are also the markets where imperialist capital is most developed. The so-called national capital has long been tacitly reduced to a vassal. At the same time, these new-style cities are the confluence of the decline of Chinese national character and the downfall of the intellectual class for many years. On the one hand, it cannot promote industrial production like small cities in Europe, America, and Japan. On the other hand, it has accepted the material consumption rate of Europe, America, and Japan. Let us think about it. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the government's inertia, the corruption and corruption of officials, and the general corruption and deterioration of society, the bourgeoisie only knows to extract the blood and sweat of the people with small capital, and the small and medium-sized bourgeoisie only knows to enjoy themselves. All of these are due to the fact that new-style cities are a severe disaster. Moreover, the decline of the countryside is also partly due to the vanity of these cities over the years. For these new-style cities that cannot promote production but only provide consumption, they are indeed the fatal wound of the Chinese nation. We use this unprecedented national struggle to destroy new-style cities, so that we can thoroughly achieve national liberation and lead the stagnant nation to the road of revival. This is not a loss for China, but precisely China's birth catalyst. As for the material aspects, some losses only illustrate that the power of colonial capital has been wiped out in China!</p>
<p>Secondly, I have already said that the Japanese imperialists' large-scale invasion of Shanghai and northern Jiangsu is based on suspicion and a preemptive strike, but within this motive, they have their own predetermined steps and one-sided hopes. If we can see through these points, then the victory or defeat between China and Japan can truly be clearly illuminated and counted. I feel that this time Japan's reckless actions have four major mistakes. The first is the incorrect assessment. They believe that China's preparations for resistance have not yet been fully realized. Due to the continued negotiations by the central government, they are still inclined to compromise. They feel that this is a very obvious weakness. Therefore, they wear the mask of negotiation and suddenly launch a military threat. Naturally, they also know that this threat will encounter resistance, but only limited resistance, and the bad examples of the "January 28th Incident" and the recent events in Tianjin and Peking have strengthened their dreamlike comfort. However, they did not expect that this assessment was incorrect. China's response was not only limited resistance, but all-out resistance. This is also because the "quasi-traitors" and the so-called "Japan experts" also misread the situation and told Japan that China did not have the determination and courage to resist, which made them light to try. The first is the contradiction in observation. The Japanese side affirmed that the high tide of China's resistance had not yet arrived. On the other hand, they were afraid that waiting for an opportunity would give China a chance to breathe. They were worried about gains and losses, as if it would be fleeting. Therefore, they prepared for a short-term military oppression to force China to yield. This seemed to them to be certain. At the same time, they knew that the capitalist countries of Europe and the United States would definitely not interfere. In the Far East, the Sino-Japanese conflict, but seeing the economic support of Britain, the United States, and France to China, they were jealous and terrified. Japan thought that the goodwill of Britain, the United States, and France towards China was only because China's overall rule was still consolidated. Then, tearing apart this strong rule, the attitude of Britain, the United States, and France towards China would inevitably declare a retreat and no longer have economic cooperation. The third is the attempt on people. The Japanese imperialists have never been able to see clearly the attitude of our supreme leader, which is the same as that of some people in China who have always held different views on the central government's resistance. Therefore, before Konoe formed his cabinet, he clearly stated at the symposium of A'an Fugaoxin and others that the general idea was, "When Japan really wants to cooperate with China, it is necessary to monitor Chiang Kai-shek's attitude." This snake of suspicion also stirred in the minds of every Japanese warlord and opportunistic bureaucrat attached to the warlords, such as Konoe and Hirota. Therefore, they must launch a fierce attack in Shanghai, which is close to the location of the central government, in the vain hope of testing the final performance of the powerful rulers. Moreover, they believe that China's unification is not yet fully mature, and a hasty advance may lead to piecemeal destruction, but they do not know that the opposite is true. The fourth is the application of internal stability. Since the "February 26th Incident," the internal contradictions of the Japanese imperialists have become increasingly acute. The warlords used the narrow patriotism shared by the Yamato nation to have no choice but to use foreign aggression as a slogan, which can divert attention and concentrate all forces. Moreover, the success of this strategy is obviously a military victory, which in turn dominates the entire politics. At that time, the authority of the warlords was higher than everything else, as if they had the ticket in hand, and the opposing contradictions naturally disappeared, but they did not know that the future of the war could not be reversed.</p>
<p>Taken together, the result of these four major mistakes has produced failures in three areas: one is the failure in politics and economics, one is the failure in diplomacy, and one is the failure in military affairs. Let me add more:</p>
<p>In order to eliminate internal contradictions and seize foreign resources, the Japanese imperialists did not hesitate to launch a large-scale and rapid invasion of China, but the protracted war, under the huge expenditure of military expenses and the inconsistency of interests of all classes, made the people unable to live and the country had no surplus strength. The outbreak of revolution may be considered at any time. Let us look at the "January 28th" war. In that short period of more than 30 days, the Japanese navy had already discovered communist movements, which is proof. Moreover, this military operation has only lasted for a month. Japan has already increased its budget three times and has also reached the first phase of the guards. These all expose the phenomenon of lifting a cauldron and breaking one's knees. Moreover, the bankruptcy of wartime trade with China and the decline in securities on the international market are also very obvious facts. Wanting to stabilize the interior is instead a medium for internal troubles, wanting to expand resources is instead leading to the collapse of finance and light industry. Is this not Japan's failure in politics and economics?</p>
<p>Japan's military aggression against China, in addition to the desire for territory and resources, attempts to create a situation in which China and Japan jointly confront the Soviet Union. The brewing of the so-called anti-communist agreement is known to the world. Therefore, it is all the more necessary to preemptively strike in the Soviet Union's military purge and China's war preparations, as mentioned earlier. However, they affirmed that the Soviet Union was temporarily unable to take care of itself and that China, hesitating between Britain and the United States, would not be able to unite immediately. At the same time, they were unwilling to slightly relax this contradictory policy, using force to replace diplomacy, simply in order to urgently threaten the realization of Sino-Japanese joint anti-communism. Unexpectedly, the result of military threats has instead promoted the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact. At the same time, Japan wants to use its strength to obstruct the economic support of capitalist countries in Europe and the United States, such as Britain, the United States, and France, to China, but it has never thought that these countries are very smart. Their attitude towards China depends on the outcome of the war and cannot be shaken by Japan's strength. Even Germany and Italy believe that the Sino-Japanese war has no direct interest in Europe and will temporarily take a bystander's attitude. Although there is the recent saying that Mussolini sent a messenger to Germany, that is only for the problems of Europe itself, such as the current Mediterranean problem. Even if it involves the Far East problem, it is only discussed incidentally. Looking at it this way, Japan's isolation is clear. Is this not Japan's failure in diplomacy?</p>
<p>The military impact is naturally even greater, but with China's vast territory and Japan's limited military strength, the war zone is too large and the situation is immediately revealed. This time, the Japanese imperialists only have guerrilla disturbances in Shandong and southern China, which also significantly illustrates the insufficient allocation of troops and that they must devote all their efforts to Shanghai and northern China. Then, the longer the stalemate, the more the strength is consumed, and the more difficult it is to develop. Moreover, what Japan relies on to expand its military force is only that its military equipment is relatively complete. Otherwise, it is far inferior to China, especially the difficulty of replenishing troops, the lack of experience of soldiers, and the high military salaries. China and Japan are in a ratio of one to ten. If there is a disastrous defeat one day, it will be difficult to continue, and if there is a mutiny, it is to be feared. Is this not Japan's failure in the military?</p>
<p>We know Japan's four major mistakes and failures in three areas, so we naturally know very well the future of this war. However, on the Chinese side, we must also observe carefully. What I personally feel is that China has twelve necessary points to pay attention to in the war of resistance. Now I will explain them one by one:</p>
<p>First, how should the loss of employment of the people be compensated?</p>
<p>Second, how should the general life be stabilized?</p>
<p>Third, how should the rebellion of the traitors be eliminated?</p>
<p>Fourth, how should production be adjusted?</p>
<p>Fifth, how should transportation be maintained?</p>
<p>Sixth, how should construction be promoted? Seventh, how should the masses be used?</p>
<p>Eighth, how should the youth be led?</p>
<p>Ninth, how should speech be controlled?</p>
<p>Tenth, how should the strength of local areas be developed?</p>
<p>Eleventh, how should the enemy be treated?</p>
<p>Twelfth, how should international propaganda be made beneficial?</p>
<h3>Cholera Epidemic in Concessions and Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Municipal Council's report, as of the 21st of this month, the total number of patients in hospitals within the Public Concession who have been determined to have cholera by mold examination and the number of deaths due to cholera are listed below. The numbers include all patients since August 30th, but those who do not reside in hospitals within the Public Concession are not included. In addition, there are still 979 patients (70 more than on the 20th) who are suspected of having cholera.</p>
<p>Recently, dozens of cases of true cholera have occurred daily in the Caowajiao area of western Shanghai, and more than 40 people have died within three days. Kangjiaqiao Street, near that area, is the most rampant, with as many as 38 men and women dying in two days. Therefore, the local health authorities are taking measures to prevent it. In addition, the epidemic is spreading rapidly in the villages near Xujiahui and northwest of Caohejing. In the past two days, more than ten people have suddenly died from vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps. For example, the Wang family in Jinjialong, four people of all ages, died one after another from the epidemic within one day and night. Among the refugees in the various shelters there, there are also many cases of people contracting the epidemic.</p>
<h3>Revolutionary Pioneer Fu Qiang Volunteers to Resist the Enemy</h3>
<p>Fu Qiang, former staff officer and quartermaster of the Iron Blood Northern Expeditionary Force who followed the martyrs Huang Keqiang, Xu Guqing, and other gentlemen to participate in the revolution during the Restoration period, is the nephew of Master Anxin, the abbot of the Ningbo Buddhist Orphanage. After the unification of the North and South, he changed his profession to business. Recently, as the enemy's rampages have intensified, he has repeatedly presented important strategies to Chairman Chiang and Commander-in-Chief Zhang Zhizhong and others, volunteering to kill the enemy. Although he is 47 years old and his hair has turned gray, he is still extremely concerned about national affairs.</p>
<h3>Cotton Mill Workers Organize National Salvation Association</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese invaders launched the Shanghai War, all major factories have been shut down, and hundreds of thousands of workers have lost their jobs. In order to seek self-help and participate in the work of national salvation, the workers of various cotton mills in this city have established the Shanghai Cotton Mill Workers' National Salvation Association, which has been officially announced. All unemployed cotton mill workers can register at the association's office at the Yu Rizhang Primary School at the end of Gordon Road and Ma Baily Road. In addition, the All-Workers National Salvation Association of the British-owned Ewo Cotton Mill, since its shutdown, also has its headquarters in the Cotton Mill Workers' National Salvation Association. All workers of the factory are expected to register as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Registration Deadline Set</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Troop (50th Troop) began recruiting members for the eighth session, many industrial associations, such as the woolen industry, the copper and iron machinery industry, the Western-style hat industry, and the rice milling industry, have recommended people to join the troop. Now, in order to expedite training, the troop has set the deadline for registration at 7:00 pm on the 25th of this month (Saturday) and has scheduled the entrance examination for the troop to begin at 7:00 am on the 26th of this month (Sunday) at the Qianjiang Primary School on Ningbo Road.</p>
<h3>People's Livelihood Education Society Implements Refugee Education</h3>
<p>In view of the importance of refugee education, the China People's Livelihood Education Society has cooperated with the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association's Committee for Relief of War Zone Refugees to implement mobile education in various refugee shelters, using the "Shuangqiu Popular Education" program and the "Popular Education" category. Members and students of the society are responsible for the work.</p>
<h3>Comforting the Soldiers Fighting the Enemy</h3>
<p>Four Children Donate Telescopes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Comfort Committee received four telescopes donated yesterday by the two sons of Mr. Pu Zhi of the China &amp; South Sea Bank and their young friends Chen Xincheng and Lou Zikang. The total value is about 600 yuan in national currency. They specifically requested that the telescopes be transferred to Chairman Chiang, General Bai Chongxi, General Zhang Fakui, and General Hu Zongnan for their separate use in order to facilitate the killing of the enemy. In addition to issuing a receipt on the spot, the committee expressed its deep admiration for the patriotic enthusiasm of Mr. Pu's two sons and their young friends Lou and Chen. It is hoped that all the children in Shanghai will save medical and miscellaneous expenses to purchase telescopes to comfort the soldiers on the front lines, because the newly arrived troops urgently need a large number of telescopes.</p>
<p>The City Islamic Association Makes Special Fried Cakes</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Shanghai Islamic Association, in addition to actively working in disaster relief and national salvation bond fundraising, has now raised 200 bags of flour from its members, and Mrs. Ma Tianying is supervising the production of fried cakes (prayer cakes), which are placed in victory bags and sent to the soldiers on the front lines to wish for victory on the front lines. The method of making them is to use boiling water to pour dry flour into a very dry batter, add eggs and a little salt to make round cakes, and fry them in oil until they are fragrant and crispy. If all parties entrust them to be made on their behalf, the association can use the power of the disaster victims in the shelters it has set up to supervise the production.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Primary and Secondary School Students and Faculty Donate Cotton Vests</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Primary and Secondary School founded by Mr. Chen Hongbi was originally located on Baoyuan Road, Zhabei. After all the school buildings were destroyed in the January 28th Incident, the new school was rebuilt on the original site. His spirit of patriotism and struggle is extremely rare. After the August 13th War of Resistance, the school moved to the Public Concession, and the cooperation between teachers and students became even more intense. Recently, all the teachers and students have been rushing to make cotton vests day and night to donate to the front lines. It is reported that 100 pieces have been made and will be sent to the Cotton Cloth Association immediately. The rest are still being made and donations are continuing.</p>
<h3>Boy Scouts Raise Money for Cotton Vests</h3>
<p>Hoping All Sectors Will Do Their Best to Donate; Cash Contributions Welcome</p>
<p>The Shanghai Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps, with the commission of the Shanghai Labor Committee, is soliciting 300,000 cotton vests for the soldiers on the front lines to keep warm. Since the beginning, it has received enthusiastic donations from all sectors, and the results have been excellent, but it is still far from the number of 300,000. Therefore, the Boy Scout Corps is enthusiastic and doing its best to donate. Those who do not have time to sew themselves can donate cash contributions at a price of one yuan per piece, which has been entrusted to Shen Changhao for production by the corps. The corps has already moved into its new address at Fusuili, Tianjin Road. The telephone number has been changed to 96577.</p>
<h3>The Charity Federation Has Sent More Than a Thousand Refugees in the Past Two Days</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association's Committee for Relief of War Zone Refugees. The summary of the work of each department on the 19th and 20th: ❶ Accounting Department: A total of 559 yuan and 6 jiao in donations were received, bringing the total to 89,430 yuan, 9 jiao, and 4 fen.

<h3>Refugees from Baoshan County</h3>
<p>The County Party Department Started Investigating and Paying Attention to Sanitation, Training, and Other Matters</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Baoshan has borne the brunt of the impact, and all five districts of the county have fallen into the war zone. The people, unable to withstand the fierce bombing of enemy aircraft and artillery fire, and the brutal atrocities of enemy soldiers' killing and burning, have had no choice but to support the old and carry the young, moving from place to place, displaced and destitute. The situation is extremely miserable. Now, no less than tens of thousands of people have successively detoured through Beixinjing to escape to the concessions, and the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association of Bao, Jia, and Bao Disaster Relief Association and other organizations have separately arranged them in various shelters for reception. However, now that autumn is approaching, the shelters are narrow and crowded, and there are many cases of dysentery and cholera. Moreover, most of the able-bodied young men are also trapped and bored. The County Party Department has organized an investigation team to conduct investigations and registrations in order to classify the young, old, weak, and strong, and provide them with training that can be used for national service at any time. It also welcomes Chinese and Western doctors and comrades from the education sector from abroad to register with the association so that they can be hired and assigned to various shelters to serve their fellow villagers. The investigators have hired many comrades, including Lin Peiran, Guo Yongfen, Gu Fangda, and Xu Zhongliang. It is also reported that the department has recently been ordered to reorganize the management committee and has temporarily set up an office to intensify the various important tasks during the emergency period.</p>
<h3>A Robbery and Murder Case on Rue Foo-Lih, with the Thief Opening Fire and Resisting Arrest</h3>
<p>The Victim Died on the Spot from His Injuries Despite Medical Treatment</p>
<p>Hu Hanming, a 30-year-old Cantonese man, worked at the Pudong Electric Company. His elder brother, Hu Zhaoli, 34, was a cotton yarn merchant, both residing in Pudong. Due to the outbreak of war, the brothers relocated to No. 365, Rue Foo-Lih in the French Concession to seek refuge. Yesterday at 6:20 AM, four robbers, speaking with local accents and armed with three handguns, entered the residence under the pretense of seeking information. They immediately silenced the occupants and stole over a hundred yuan in cash and valuables. As they fled, a resident shouted for help, prompting the robbers to fire three shots. Hu Zhaoli, who was in the living room, was struck by a bullet that entered his right arm and exited. Another bullet struck his lower abdomen, causing him to collapse. The robbers then fled. The French Concession police, upon receiving the report, dispatched detectives to the scene, but the robbers had already escaped. The injured man was taken to Guangci Hospital, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died at 11:00 AM. The police sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy, scheduled for today. Meanwhile, the police have dispatched detectives to investigate and apprehend the fleeing robbers to bring them to justice.</p>

<h3>The Enemy's Main Force Suffers Defeat in its Attack, Our Defenses are Solid in Luodian and Liuhang</h3>
<p>The Enemy Acknowledges Severe Blows to its Offensive; No Fierce Fighting on the Jiangwan-Zhabei Front</p>
<p>For days, the enemy has been using its main force to attack our lines at Luodian and Liuhang. Fierce fighting has occurred in the villages surrounding Luodian. Southeast of Luodian, the fighting has concentrated in areas such as Youmeizhai, Suchenzhai, Zhangjiazhai, and Jinzhai, involving intense hand-to-hand combat with advances and retreats. As of this afternoon, we continue to maintain our original lines. Northwest of Luodian, artillery fire has concentrated on areas around Sucun and Yangjiacun. The fighting has not ceased for a moment in the past three days and nights. Although the enemy relies on its aircraft, artillery, and tanks, our troops are in high spirits, charging into battle and fighting tenaciously. Furthermore, our defensive works are exceptionally solid. The enemy has consistently failed to advance past the first line of defense. Regarding Liuhang, the enemy attacked on two fronts, with incessant suppressing artillery fire. However, our positions sustained minimal damage. The enemy launched over ten fierce attacks, all of which were repelled by our forces, resulting in heavy casualties for the enemy. Yesterday, an enemy spokesperson told foreign reporters that our defensive works from Luodian to Liuhang were solid and that the enemy found it extremely difficult to advance, which serves as a strong testament to our military's victory. The enemy attacking on this front has clearly suffered a severe blow. As for the Jiangwan-Zhabei front, there have been occasional artillery exchanges and small-unit skirmishes, but these are merely embellishments to the overall situation and are insignificant to the broader strategic picture. There have been no changes to our lines.</p>
<p>In the Liuhang area, the enemy on our front lines retreated in disarray after being severely struck by our forces in Zhangzhai and Mengwan. Yesterday, the enemy on the front lines dared not advance with infantry, and only its rear artillery units carried out aimless shelling of our positions, causing no damage to our positions.</p>
<h3>The Enemy is Repelled in its Attack on Sucun; 300 Enemies Annihilated at Yaozhai</h3>
<p>An Enemy Company Commander is Killed by Our Forces; Zhang Hai Peng's Puppet Troops Attack Our Yangjiacun</p>
<p>On the northwest front of Luodian, fierce fighting has continued unabated in the Sucun and Yangjiacun area for days. Enemy forces attempting to attack our positions in that area were met with a head-on counterattack by our forces. On the day before yesterday, enemy troops attacked our Sucun positions with the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the Taipei Garrison, while Zhang Hai Peng's puppet troops attacked our Yangjiacun positions. All squad leaders and higher ranks in the puppet army were Japanese. The enemy first unleashed intense artillery fire on our positions, relentlessly bombarding them throughout the day. In the evening, they attempted to advance towards our positions. Our defenses were exceptionally solid, and our troops calmly responded, remaining unmoved. When the enemy approached, they jumped out and launched a fierce attack, resulting in intense fighting. Our troops bravely charged forward, causing the enemy forces to collapse in disarray. Our troops took advantage of the victory and pursued the enemy, driving them back more than half a kilometer. Approximately two companies or more of the enemy, numbering over 300, who fled to Yaozhai northwest of Sucun, were surrounded and annihilated by our forces. The ground was littered with corpses. Some of the surviving troops even climbed trees to escape, but were still shot down by our troops. Upon inspecting the enemy corpses, a company commander and several platoon leaders were found to have been killed. One enemy soldier was captured alive. By dawn yesterday, the remaining enemy forces had been completely cleared. Countless spoils of war were seized. Yesterday, the enemy dared not attack again, with only artillery fire observed. In the evening, some enemy troops harassed the area, but were again repelled by our forces.</p>
<h3>Enemy Artillery Fire Concentrated on Jinzhai</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting Throughout the Day; Our Positions Completely Recovered</p>
<p>On the southeastern front of Luodian, the enemy's attacks on our lines at Youmeizhai, Suchenzhai, Zhangjiazhai, and Jinzhai have been particularly fierce. The number of artillery shells fired has often been in the thousands. The area near Jinzhai has been the target of the enemy's artillery fire, with the most intense bombardment. From morning to night the day before yesterday, the enemy's artillery fire was incessant. Our defensive works were almost completely destroyed, making it impossible to defend them. In the evening, our troops in Jinzhai and Zhangjiazhai retreated slightly to avoid unnecessary casualties. After holding out until midnight, our reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce counterattack against the enemy. The enemy was caught completely off guard and panicked, collapsing in disarray. Our troops killed countless enemies. The fighting continued until dawn yesterday, when the positions at Jinzhai and Zhangjiazhai were completely recovered, and we firmly defended our original lines. From yesterday morning to evening, fierce fighting continued unabated on that front.</p>
<h3>Enemy Flies Heavy Artillery Units to Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from this Newspaper) The enemy has been launching a major offensive against our Luodian-Liuhang front in recent days and has clearly suffered a severe blow. According to reports, the enemy has now flown heavy artillery units from Korea to Shanghai to assist in the operation. They are also unloading the large guns from some of their warships and installing them on land to increase their land artillery power. These frantic actions by the enemy demonstrate that their campaign is in a very unfavorable position. We are prepared and unafraid. Although the enemy's artillery fire is fierce, it will never be enough to crush our army's morale to kill the enemy.</p>
<h3>Only Minor Battles in Zhabei and Jiangwan</h3>
<p>There have been no major changes in the Zhabei and Jiangwan sectors in recent days. Our troops remain steadfast in their original positions. However, daily artillery exchanges and skirmishes involving small units continue. The enemy's primary objectives continue to focus on Luodian and various locations along the Yangtze River, hoping to fulfill their dream of landing at Liuhe and Yanglinkou, as they did during the "January 28th" Incident.</p>
<h3>Our Brave Soldiers Seize Armored Vehicles</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from this Newspaper) This morning, a certain officer came to Shanghai from the front lines of Liuhang to discuss the battle situation with reporters. His account was very valuable. Here are the key points: ❶ The bloody battle in Liuhang has been extremely fierce in recent days. The enemy frequently uses heavy weapons such as armored vehicles and tanks. Although these weapons are as solid as iron, they sometimes lose their effectiveness. For example, they can move freely on highways and flat ground, but they have difficulty traveling across rivers or muddy farmland. The recent continuous rain has softened the cotton fields, so the enemy's heavy weapons are not as active as they were before. ❷ During a fierce battle on a certain line a few days ago, the enemy advanced with five or six armored vehicles on the Kunlian Highway, charging directly towards our positions. Our troops bombarded them with flat-trajectory guns and other artillery, destroying one vehicle. The others continued to advance. When they got close, our soldiers threw hand grenades. The machine guns in the vehicles fired in all directions with fierce firepower. Two Cantonese soldiers rushed to the side of an armored car, clung to its bottom, and moved with the vehicle. One of them pulled out a bayonet and stabbed the driver through an opening, killing him. The other men then jumped in. Seeing the situation was bad, the remaining vehicles immediately reversed and retreated. As a result, this armored vehicle and its two gunners were captured by us, but the two soldiers were also slightly wounded. This story has spread throughout the army and is considered a great anecdote. ❸ When the enemy gets close to us, they often use grenade launchers, which have a range of about 200 meters. The explosive power of these grenades is similar to that of hand grenades. The launcher is lighter than a mortar, making it easier to use. The clever thing about this grenade is that it rolls for 20 to 30 meters after landing before exploding. This is also a powerful weapon invented by the enemy.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Begin Unloading Ammunition Yesterday</h3>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that sources received information this morning that an enemy transport ship arrived at the Huangpu Wharf in Yangshupu late last night. It immediately unloaded more than 30 aircraft bodies and parts. Multiple trucks then transported them separately to the temporary naval airfield at the International Recreation Ground near the Gongda Yarn Factory for assembly, intending for their use. This is because the enemy aircraft have suffered exceptionally heavy losses in the recent attacks on our capital and other places.</p>
<p>Another report states that at about 6:30 this morning, two small enemy gunboats, No. 32 and No. 1, arrived at the Mitsubishi Wharf next to the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road and unloaded a considerable amount of ammunition. At the same time, an enemy transport ship carrying corpses back to Japan was at the Gonghexiang Wharf, loading the bodies of enemy soldiers wrapped in linen. The loading continued until about noon, when the ship finally raised anchor and set sail.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft's Brutality Extends Even to Old Bones</h3>
<p>Multiple Graves Destroyed in Pudong</p>
<p>Six enemy aircraft conducted reconnaissance and bombing in the area behind Lujiazui in Pudong from 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM yesterday. Their intention seemed to be to bomb our artillery positions, but our artillery positions are mysteriously hidden and were not damaged at all. This morning, a reporter visited Pudong to investigate. The enemy aircraft dropped more than ten bombs, with their only targets being trees, bamboo groves, and tall graves. The graves are mostly located in the rural areas of Pudong, with urban mounds that are large and high. The enemy believed them to be our military defenses. Thus, the enemy's brutality even extended to old bones. It was discovered that several graves behind Lujiazhai were destroyed, creating huge holes. A long-abandoned grave with an area of more than ten mu in front of the Northeast Ice Factory of the Lan Nidu Police Station, decorated with stone figures and horses, is said to be the tomb of Lu Shangshu of the Ming Dynasty. It was also bombed and became a deep pool. In addition, only a dozen villagers were injured.</p>
<p>At 12:30 this afternoon, several enemy aircraft flew to the Pudong area in the misty rain and dropped many bombs, which had not stopped at the time of this publication's deadline.</p>
<p>At around 5:00 PM yesterday evening, a squadron of Japanese aircraft flew about one mile southeast of Dachang and dropped 20 to 30 bombs near the Shanghai-Tai Road. Troops stationed near Lujiazui fired machine guns several times.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb Civilian Boats on Inland Rivers</h3>
<p>Zhang Genfa's Entire Family of Four Generations Dies Together</p>
<p>Zhang Genfa, a barge operator in the South City, usually transported grain for various rice shops. His entire family lived on the boat, but Zhang did not live on the boat because he worked at various shops. Since the war, the boat has been moored in the South Huangpu. Recently, he went to Suzhou to transport Chinese medicine for the hospital to Shanghai. On the boat were Zhang's mother, wife, son and daughter-in-law in their twenties, grandson, and two boatmen. The day before yesterday, he and five other boats returned to Shanghai, traveling along the inland rivers via Pingwang. Unexpectedly, two enemy aircraft flew over and bombed them. Zhang's boat was sunk, and all four generations of Zhang's family were killed. One boatman was killed and the other was injured. The injured boatman has now arrived in Shanghai with a severed left arm. He said that the enemy aircraft fly to small inland ports every day to conduct reconnaissance. If they encounter heavily laden civilian boats, they will bomb them indiscriminately, regardless of whether they are related to military affairs.</p>
<h3>Enemy Uses Dum-Dum Bullets in Yanghang</h3>
<p>The Taiwan Garrison is Annihilated by Our Forces</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd) According to reliable sources, the enemy has used dum-dum bullets in Yanghang, Shanghai. Soldiers wounded by these poisonous bullets have been found in our rear hospitals.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd) Military news: On the morning of the 21st, the enemy's main force launched a fierce attack on us from Yanghang, Shanghai. Artillery fire was extremely intense, with about 60 shells landing near Liuhang every minute. Our troops fought to the death, and our positions remained unchanged. Youmeizhai, Zhangjiazhai, Jincun, and other places were lost and regained. The enemy's attacks on other key points were fierce, but they have not changed our positions. The enemy near Yaozhai was the Taiwan Garrison of about 400 men, who have been surrounded and annihilated by us.</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Establishes Directorate General of Military Law Enforcement</h3>
<p>Military Law Enforcement Supervisors Established in Each War Zone</p>
<p>[Nanjing] To strengthen military discipline and strictly enforce military law during the war of resistance, the Military Affairs Commission has established the Directorate General of Military Law Enforcement, which is in charge of wartime military law and the execution of all military law matters nationwide.

<h3>Content of Japan's Reply to the Case of the British Ambassador Being Wounded</h3>
<p>The British Government Expresses Satisfaction</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the injury of British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the Japanese government has sent a formal expression of deep regret to the British government. The Japanese document stated that two Japanese aircraft had bombed and machine-gunned two vehicles that they sincerely believed to be military automobiles or transport vehicles carrying officers and soldiers of the Chinese army. Therefore, the Japanese government believes that the incident may have been caused by the Japanese aircraft mistaking the ambassador's vehicle for military automobiles or transport vehicles. The document further stated that the Japanese government is willing to take appropriate steps to prove that Japanese aircraft pilots have caused death or injury to people of third countries, whether intentionally or due to negligence. It also stated that the Japanese government has now issued instructions to the Japanese army in China to provide the most careful protection to non-combatants.

<h3>Enemy Falsely Accuses Our Troops of Using Poison Gas in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Confusing International Public Opinion and Deliberately Spreading False Information in Order to Justify Their Own Use of Poison Gas</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Japanese side broadcast by radio the day before yesterday, falsely accusing our troops of using poison gas in Shanghai. Our military spokesman said that our troops have never used any gas since the war of resistance began. Our troops are purely resisting the enemy's aggression, and their combat methods are completely in accordance with international law. Any action that violates international law or is unnecessary or inhumane has always been condemned by our troops or authorities. What the Japanese side said in the broadcast is either fabricated rumors intended to confuse international public opinion or is deliberately spreading false information to justify their own use of poison gas. Fortunately, the world is already aware of the various brutal acts of the Japanese army, such as bombing the Red Cross, attacking non-combatants, and destroying cultural institutions, and will certainly not fall for the Japanese side's tricks.

<h3>Miscellaneous Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Since the August 13th Incident occurred, we have recognized the importance of both domestic and international propaganda. However, the methods of propaganda have never seemed particularly brilliant. I think our propaganda work should adopt the enemy's methods. Here are two examples for now.</p>
<p>㊀ A certain Japanese person at a Japanese station broadcasted a radio program using fluent Chinese, telling listeners that eyewitnesses to the Nanjing air battles said that, except for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all the buildings of Nanjing's government offices were hit by airplane bombs and burned down. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was also nearly hit, and Nanjing had been reduced to scorched earth, and so on.</p>
<p>Please note: this was the report from the day before yesterday. Nanjing is already scorched earth. But yesterday, a large number of enemy planes flew to attack the capital again. I wonder what else they are going to bomb?</p>
<p>㊁ A dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 22nd stated that according to the intelligence received by the Army Ministry today, the Nanjing government has decided on a desperate measure, aiming to extend the direct war to the rights and interests of foreign countries, plunging third countries into the whirlpool of conflict. It seems that they intend to take advantage of the Japanese air force's attack on Nanjing to use Chinese air force planes to bomb the British and Soviet embassies.</p>
<p>Please note: The commander of the Third Japanese Fleet, Hasegawa, notified the ambassadors of various countries the day before yesterday to avoid Nanjing, but all the ambassadors unanimously refused. Therefore, they are using such a propaganda method. In the event that bombs are deliberately or randomly dropped on the roofs of the British and Soviet embassies, they can shift the responsibility to our air force and escape their own responsibility.</p>
<p>The above two propaganda methods, one is to fabricate past events out of thin air, and the other is to prevent future events from happening so that they can shirk responsibility. How clever and meaningful is this kind of propaganda. I don't have time to make a serious criticism at the moment, but I deeply admire the enemy's intelligence.</p>

<h3>Wartime Industrial Allocation That Cannot Wait</h3>
<p>— Wei Youfei</p>
<p>Our comprehensive war of resistance is not to say that war has broken out on every piece of land, but to inspire everyone to do their best to engage in the war against the invaders. Therefore, the soldiers on the front lines working on the battlefield, this is resistance! The rear area solemnly doing all the wartime allocation work, this is also resistance!</p>
<p>In the one month since the Shanghai battle, our front-line resistance forces have been fully demonstrated! However, it can be pointed out that our rear support allocation is too poor! Where is this wartime allocation? This is peacetime! Although it cannot be denied that many people are solemnly doing national salvation work, from the perspective of comprehensive resistance, it is obviously far from enough. What I want to propose here is the industrial allocation plan.</p>
<p>The sole objective of all wartime economic and political measures is to strengthen the resistance forces in the rear so that the government can mobilize at any time. But our industrial circles, more narrowly speaking, are not like this for factories. Before the war, yes, they were starting production; when the war broke out, they could not work and stopped production. Factories not under fire slowly resumed production, and factories within the range of fire could not work, so they were left to stagnate and be destroyed! Where is this wartime allocation? This is a life of resignation to fate!</p>
<p>News came that many large-scale factories in the Hongkou area, such as the Shenxin Nos. 5 and 7 Factories, could not operate. The Huacheng Tobacco Company was destroyed, the Wuhe Weaving Factory was destroyed, and the Nanyang Tobacco Company was also destroyed. The products of these many factories may not directly aid the war, but we dare to say that these are all our production organs, that is, our resistance forces. This is not just the business of one person or a few people gathering capital, but the production organs of the entire 450 million people; a few people may have the power to bear the loss of being bombed, but many, many workers who directly and indirectly rely on the factory for their livelihoods, and the consumers who rely on the products, will all be affected. Workers lose their jobs and cannot live, this is a loss of resistance power! Production decreases, production stagnates, this is also a loss of resistance power!</p>
<p>Aren't there many people shouting to go to the interior? Aren't there many people hoping that the government will think of a way for factories in the war zone? These are all empty talk. We need practical work.</p>
<p>Today, there are factories going to the interior. But their relocation work, some have moved from Zhabei to the French Concession, and some have moved from Shanghai to Suzhou, Changsha, Hankou, or Nanchang. In short, although every factory is moving, transportation under fire is very difficult, and everyone's strength is limited. Although they have done their best, the achievements are not very many.</p>
<p>Of course, this kind of leadership responsibility should be given to the state, but before the state gives an order, factories should think of their own ways.</p>
<p>It is a matter of course for factories to go to the interior. The first thing to decide is to divide the industrial areas and designate them for factories to move to. In other words, moving factories from Zhabei to the French Concession, although it does not hinder production, is definitely not a thorough solution. The government should designate where the industrial center is, which is a safe zone, and concentrate the factories there. In order to make the allocation as good as possible, it should also specify which types of factories should be concentrated there, and how many of a certain type of factory in a certain place should be the limit. In terms of products, it should also specify which essential products must be manufactured intensively, and which consumable products must be stopped or reduced in manufacture, saving those resources and concentrating them on the manufacture of essential products.</p>
<p>Once the concentrated area for relocation is determined, we can discuss the method of relocation. It is better to use the strength of a group to relocate than to use the strength of each factory to relocate. It would be even better if the government could relocate. When relocating, the government should provide as much convenience as possible, either relocating in stages or relocating by region, and arriving at the destination.</p>
<p>After relocating to the interior, work should begin. Work requires working capital, which should of course be supplied by the National Bank. In my opinion, it is best to treat those relief expenses or transportation expenses as state-added capital when the government helps factories relocate. After moving to the interior, the new factory site should be pledged to the National Bank, and the funds obtained from the pledge will be the working capital.</p>
<p>This is a long-term war of resistance, a comprehensive war of resistance. We must not be complacent and mislead ourselves and the country. Therefore, factories in Shanghai need to be relocated, and factories on all coasts and in non-industrial areas also need to be concentrated. The ultimate goal of our war of resistance is to survive. We need production, we need to increase national productivity.</p>
<p>Now, I summarize my opinions on wartime industrial allocation as follows: ㊀ Designate industrial areas and subsidize concentration by state power; ㊁ The state lends capital, private individuals manage, and the state supervises; ㊂ The state is responsible for distribution and implements interest guarantee methods to attract private capital.

<h3>More Than a Dozen Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Zhejiang Province, Eight of Which Were Shipped to Nanjing from September 19 for Display</h3>
<p>— (International News Agency)</p>
<h3>Evaluation of the Strength of the Japanese Air Force</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>Japan, which prides itself on being one of the five great powers, has always looked down on our country. "It doesn't take three months to conquer the entire territory of China," and "It doesn't take two hours to occupy the whole of Shanghai." These two sentences are often said by Japanese military personnel who claim to be experts on China and advocate annexing China. However, as proven by the current facts, they have long become delirious nonsense. Taking just Shanghai as an example, the enemy has used the power of the entire nation's sea, land, and air forces to attack for more than a month, resulting in the waste of 500 to 600 million yuan in military expenses, the destruction of 70 to 80 aircraft, the deaths and injuries of 20,000 or so naval and army soldiers, and the sinking of several warships. As for our country, apart from destroying our cultural buildings and massacring thousands of innocent civilians, it can be said that nothing has been gained. Now, I will review the strength of the Japanese Air Force.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Japanese Air Force has only been for ten years. In Showa 7, Republic of China 21 (land-based troops only had 136 aircraft), it gradually increased. The army had 580 regular aircraft, and apart from defending important domestic areas, less than 300 were available for combat. By the previous year (Showa 10), the total budget increased by 18 million yuan, and there were 589 pilots. In that year, the "Ten-Year Plan for the Great Air Force" was also established. Because the budget was opposed by the Ministry of Finance and could not be passed, it caused friction between the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Finance, and the planned policy became a bubble. However, more than 1,600 aircraft were purchased and manufactured one after another. There are two types of aircraft: "Army" and "Navy." Army aircraft include four types: ㊀ Type 52 Reconnaissance Aircraft, ㊁ Type 92 Fighter Aircraft, ㊂ Type 87 Heavy Bomber, and ㊃ Type 88 Light Bomber. Naval aircraft include three types: ㊀ Type 13 Carrier-based Attack Aircraft (the aircraft carriers Akagi, Kaga, Ryujo, and Hosho are all equipped with this aircraft), ㊁ Type 90 Seaplane Reconnaissance Aircraft, and ㊆ Type 90 Airship (more than 20 meters in length, 15 tons in weight, 2,400 horsepower, and a speed of 220 kilometers). Since the establishment of the Ten-Year Plan, civil aviation has also gradually developed. Recently, for the sake of invading China, all large-scale civilian transport aircraft have been converted into heavy bombers, and small aircraft have been converted into reconnaissance aircraft and fighters. The speed of the fighter aircraft is 300 kilometers, the altitude is 8,000 meters, and the flight time is only three hours. The aircraft only carries one person and is equipped with two machine guns. The caliber of the guns is approximately 7 to 8 mm, and they can fire more than 700 rounds per minute. The army uses Type A-4 wooden aircraft, with a speed of 300 horsepower, and Type 51 light alloy aircraft, with a speed of 450 horsepower. The reconnaissance aircraft are Type A-1 wooden aircraft, with a speed of 230 horsepower, and Type 88 light alloy aircraft, with a speed of 450 horsepower, and Type 92, with a speed of 400 horsepower. The reconnaissance aircraft carry one pilot and one reconnaissance officer and are also equipped with two machine guns. The Type 87 bomber has an attached Type 88, with a speed of 200 kilometers. The maximum flight range is only 10 hours, and the altitude is 5,000 meters. The army's air force squadrons are located in Jifu (first and second squadrons), Yasonomura, Shiga Prefecture (third squadron), Fukuoka (fourth squadron), Tachikawa, Tokyo (fifth squadron), Pyongyang, Korea (sixth squadron), Hamamatsu (seventh squadron), Taipei, Taiwan (eighth squadron), and Togamura, Chiba Prefecture (balloon squadron). There are also airfields in Nagano, Niigata, Osaka, Toyama, Tokushima, Kochi, Tottori, Sendai, Matsue, Aomori, Sapporo, and other places. As for the Nagoya Flying School, the Asia Flying School, the Japan Light Aircraft Club, and the Japan Aviation Transportation Research Institute, they are only places for training preliminary aviation talents. Aircraft manufacturing factories include Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, Kawanishi, and Ishikawa. These factories can only manufacture partial accessory parts. Important parts still have to rely on European and American countries. Last year, the country loudly advocated "high-speed air force," and a second international airport was added in Osaka, and an airport was added in Yonago. Civilian air transportation was developed, and at the same time, the trial production of aircraft and engines was encouraged. However, after the so-called Type 11 domestically produced excellent aircraft was created, it crashed and self-destructed after several test flights. In short, the Japanese themselves are very worried about the immaturity of Japanese aviation technology. According to Lieutenant General Siwangtian Yanxiao of the enemy army, when Japanese aircraft fought over Suzhou and Hangzhou during the January 28th Incident, Major Kotani died in battle. The Kakamigahara area originally wanted to train a large number of flight seven, but only eight qualified. Especially, the citizens lack aviation knowledge, and Japanese buildings are all made of wood. If they are hit by a 500-kilogram bomb, the entire city of Nagoya can be burned in an instant." French Colonel Ganno said, "If a formation of more than a dozen aircraft bombards Tokyo, that great Tokyo can be turned into scorched earth in an hour. Therefore, if the entire territory of Japan is threatened by the air force, it can be completely turned into ruins in ten hours." Also, Japanese Ikazaki Tadataka said, "If war breaks out between Japan and the United States in the future, the American air force can really control the fate of Japan. If the American air force occupies Ogasawara Island, then not only will the Japanese navy be completely ineffective, but all of Japan will inevitably become scorched earth. Therefore, it is imperative to strengthen the air force to counter the enemy." Lieutenant Colonel Nakayama Shiro of the Army Infantry said, "What Japan is most worried about is the air force of Russia and the United States, because Japan, surrounded by the sea and a narrow and long territory, if one or two aircraft carriers sneak into the sea, and our major cities and large factory areas are located on the coast, the enemy's air force can easily fly in to harass us."</p>
<h3>Major Fire on Xinmin Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Fierce Fire, Difficult to Obtain Water, More Than Fifty Buildings Destroyed</p>
<p>At around 8:00 a.m. on the 22nd, a fire suddenly broke out at the intersection of Xinmin Road and Datong Road in Zhabei. According to general rumors, it was arson by traitors. Initially, there was thick smoke, but soon the flames soared into the sky. Even in broad daylight, the sky was red. The nearby firefighting association was the first to learn of it and immediately drove a fire engine to the scene to put out the fire. However, tap water had been cut off, and it was difficult to connect. After the association used a long hose to draw water from the Suzhou River to put out the fire, the fire was fierce, and the flames spread eastward. By 11:30, it had burned to the Xinzhapu Police Station. Fortunately, the station had already moved elsewhere, and only a few floors of empty houses were destroyed. By 12:00, about fifty residential buildings in the area had been destroyed. Although the fire engines tried their best to put out the fire, they could not contain it.</p>
