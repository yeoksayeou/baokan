<p>時評</p>
<h3>德意軸心與中歐政局</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>最近幾天中歐洲各國的政治家都互相訪謁舉行談話。好像有什麼重大的事情就要發生。不得不急謀彌補之方似的。如英國外相艾登之訪比。法國國防部長達垃第之訪英。奧國總理許斯呢格與外相史密特之訪謁墨索里尼。德國戈林將軍之訪羅馬。波蘭外長之聘問羅馬尼亞。匈牙利國防部長之僕僕於柏林與維也納的道上意大利外相之訪問阿爾巴尼亞都是最近數天內的事。在不久以後。南斯拉夫總理將有羅馬之行。德國外長將聘問意國。而不大步出國門的墨索里尼也將有柏林之行這些政治家與外交家的僕僕風塵。倒底是為些什麼事呢。</p>
<p>簡單的說。這些政治家的互相往來。實為歐洲政局劇烈動盪的表現。最近歐洲。政局之最明顯的發展。則為德意軸心力量的日見擴大。德意軸心是為對付英法蘇捷等國的和平軸心而成立的。它的機構建築於意奧匈三國羅馬議定書德奧協定與德意協定的上面到了最近德意二國一方面想極力鞏固這軸心的組織一方面則又企圖發展這軸心的勢力為着達到前一目的起見。有奧總理與墨索里尼的談話。及戈林裝軍的訪意。在意奧談話中。墨氏極力觀誘奧國放棄與捷克訂立政治協定並改變反德的政策因為奧國是德意合作的橋樑奧國如果採取反德親捷的政策則德意軸心就有隨時中斷的可能現在意奧談話以後奧國的態度似已稍有改變同時戈林訪意的結果對於德意合作的前途也有柜當的增進。</p>
<p>這是就鞏固德意較心的勢力說的。至於德意擴充這軸心力量的工作。也在積極推進上月間意。南成立政治經濟協定。使向反對意國的貝爾格拉達當局漸漸落入法西斯的隱套。最近意國又極力拉攏羅馬尼亞。企圖訂立與意南協定同樣性質的政治經濟協定。這次親德傾向極濃的波蘭外長貝克之前往羅京當於此事有相當的關係。將來羅馬尼亞如果也像南斯拉夫一樣的落入法西斯的勢力國中那末協約國的團結就要完全拆散了。</p>
<p>就最近中歐形勢的發展觀察侵略性質的德意軸心的力量頗有日漸鞏固與擴展的傾向。這種事實對於國際和平的前途當然不利。不過我們以為德惹二國對於英法蘇聯等國雖有共同的利害關係但他們在中歐與巴爾幹的利益衝突非常尖銳。仍有隨時破臉的可能。而且奧國是的反德態度還不至于因意國的勸誘而完全改變這觀於許斯尼格於回國後發表反對國社黨加入祖國陣綫一事就右明瞭。匈牙利自從親德的貢波斯逝世後。反德色彩。很楚濃厚。這於德意合作的前途也有很大的阻碍。此外。英法與蘇聯對於最近德意外交的活躍當然不會袖手旁觀他們必定要設法阻止這軸心勢力的發展。這次艾登的訪比。就負有使比國不落入德國圈套的使命。同時法蘇在東南歐方面也必採取反攻的外交戰。使德意軸心勢力不能順利發展所以德意最近在外交上雖然非常活躍但前途還楚不很樂觀的。</p>

<h3>密雲不雨之察北</h3>
<p>某方施放備戰烟幕　德王李守信互排擠</p>
<p>張北通信、察北近况、邇來空氣雖形緊張但國際情况、並未若何嚴重、其原因一由德王興李守信之互相排擠、一方亦為某方國策之未决定、故特施烟幕、於徵車調軍•運械儘糧•等之準備職此之故、察北近况、乃形成密雲不雨之狀态、玆將敢近消息彙誌於下、</p>
<p>某方施惠小恩</p>
<p>某方對於察北攸關軍之交通、素極重視、各縣間之公路早已次第落成、茲因沾源至張北間、向無直達之捷使公路、頗感不便、正在積極徵夫趕築張沽公路、完成之後、凡由熱河入察之軍隊革火私貨等均可直達張北、瞬至張垣、予其運輸上以極大便利、同時更鑒於察北偽軍之不安、及民衆之怨望、故一方按時供給偽組織之餉糈一方並令偽組織向張北•寶源•（係寶昌•沽源•兩縣合併之改名）多倫•等縣、徵集大宗食糧、分運戰區之大青溝南壕塹•商都•等地、遭受戰事損失之民衆、每一村民給賑糧二斗、運日放出約千餘石、取之吾人者、轉而市小惠於吾人、察北人民當對此惠而不費之狡謀、諒已洞曉、</p>
<p>德李交惡露骨</p>
<p>李守信雖係蒙人、但因生於熱河、以客軍資格、混跡察北、過云與德王•王英、勢力鼎足而三、德王又自以為是蒙古王公、久已以地主自居、夙存“臥楊之旁豈容他人鼾睡”之念、現王英已去、惟李尚存、乃乘本年某方决意改編偽軍之際、慫恿某方、暗將李之兵權奪去、另畀以副軍長及德化市市長虛名、但李部下之師長、多牛係李之同鄉、德王實不能任意調遣、故李亦深願率其原有之四師入熱河、以保實力、現察北空有十師之名、除第七師尚未成立、第十師穆克登實部亦係初編外、實則八師不過萬人、倘李率四師東去、則實力卽减去一半、所以李部雖有東開之說、迄未成事實、其原因卽在此、無如德王李守信二人情感、近益趨惡化、本月二十三日、李突令現駐嘉卜寺之前第一軍軍部八大處人員、全體離嘉卜寺開駐張北、儼然興德王有分立之勢、其交惡情形、益顯露骨、傳李已派部入熱、在熱西一帶修築工事、但此說在某方淫威下、如無其他用意恐其行動不能如此自由、大約恐不可靠、</p>

<h3>刺汪宋案判决全文（續）</h3>
<p>（乙）關於余文奎煽惑軍隊部分</p>
<p>查犯罪事實應依證據認定之、此為刑事訴訟法第二百六十八條所明定、本件據檢察官起訴事實略載、“被告於二十三年受福建人民政府委任寫民族武裝自衛軍總指揮、去湖南煽惑軍隊、旋因人民政府失敗無效而返”等語、群核被告供詞、除供認二十三年受福建人民政府委任為民族武裝自衛軍總指揮並未就職、且經國府明令將該人民政府首要之人撇銷通緝、自可毋庸置疑外、其餘所述往湖南煽惑軍隊、遍查本案全卷、該被告始終並無自認之詞、卽其在偵查中所稱命伊往兩湖一帶活動軍隊、亦因人民政有失敗而未曾前往、則該被含之煽惑行為、尚未着手、於犯罪之實行、殊難認為成立犯罪、</p>
<p>雖胡大海於民國二十五年八月二十九日在首都警察廳述稱“我於二十四年廢曆九月二十一日（卽國歷十月十八日）至鄭益堅家、約在廢曆十月初間、（卽國歷十月及十一月間）始見余立奎歸來、其歸時僅携皮箱一只、聽說彼來自湖南、於箱內取出南嶽進香之黃布袋兩只、我卽知其在湖南招兵回來”云云、然經質諸被告、旣稱當時我擬往黔途經湖南、適因貴州兵變、交通梗塞、我乃返由衡州”、我携有行李箱籠、因往衡山遊玩、順便購得黑底紅字朝山進香之布袋兩只、一併携歸“、“袋屬夾者、外為青布、內係似黃非黃似白非白之土布所製”“我未招募軍隊胡大海也未見我招募、純係彼理想之言不足憑信”等語、而胡大海於同年九月十九日在江蘇高等法院第五分院檢察官前陳述亦稱“余立奎由湖南來、我之理想以為彼係招募軍隊”可知胡大海之指供純係出於推測、並未目見被告有招兵之事實、</p>
<p>觀於胡大海在本院訊問時所稱“因為他（指被告）是軍人、我理想彼赴湖南、係為招兵、究竟是否如此我亦不知”等數語益足證明該被告並無在湖南煽惑軍隊情中、此外更經質諸王仁山及其他被告亦　不知該被告有無此事、抗辯意旨主張胡大海之供述、不足憑信自非全無理由、本院應認被告關於該部分之犯罪嫌疑不能證明、</p>
<p>（二）胡大海部分、據被告胡大海辯稱、“我於民國二十四年三四月間在香港住軒鯉詩道四四五號、約二月左右、後往廣州謀事無着、於九月間復返香港、旋在鄭益堅家謀得厨子工作、卽往该處服務、工作一月後、因鄭益堅命送手提箱至李家、該箱輕而加鎖、不知所藏何物、走不多遠、乃遇巡捕於跑馬地、彼問箱內有無烟土、我說箱為主人所有之物、彼欲啟視、將箱打開、覓有委狀在內、即行蓋好、擬將我帶往捕房、我問究犯何罪、彼答犯中國政府之罪非犯香港政府之罪、卽將我人箱帶往、至二十三年七月、我正回家葬妻、並未外出十一月續弦亦住家內、並無與王亞樵等在灣子道巴炳頓道光明台豐富台永興街成河道等處開會之事等語、核其所供各節關於葬妻續弦及往廣州等事實、並無相當證據足資證明、已屬不能採信、</p>
<p>至其就獲時、對警探所述情形、據香港華採劉明於二十五年二月六日在巡理府供稱一、去年十一月二十二日下午、本人奉命探訪余立奎案件、是日四時半左右、我巡至禮頓山道近黃泥涵道口、見一人立於汽車站旁、右宇提手提箱一隻、左腋下挾包裹一個、我卽趨前操粵語謂之旦我乃香港華探現欲搜索汝之包裹提箱”彼答稱“我將送此往李家去、不能任汝搜案一我問彼“由何處來、”彼答“七號、言時並指耀華街、我乃出證章示之、搜其身體、所獲、啟視包裹亦無所得、於是搜索提箱、在搜索該提箱前、詢以箱內所藏何物、”彼答“不知”該箱並未加鎖促其啟視、彼即開啟并謂一不可令人窺見、此並非遠反香港法例　本人見箱內文件甚多、內有絲織品一件、上書余立奎之名、此即我所查案件中人物之名字也、我欲將其帶至警署、彼乃自稱為胡大海、此名為我前所未聞”云云該被舍旣知不違反省港法例、卽足證明其對於箱內之物、完全知情、王余等密謀暗殺之事、亦屬參與否則何以知其內容為不違反香港法例、况被告所稱箱上加鎖“及”巡捕向其詢問箱內有無烟土、均與劉明之述詞極端牴牾其為飾調抗辯、尤屬瞭無疑養、本院自應認該被告為有參與暗殺之事實、</p>
<p>（三）周世平部分查被告周世平抗辯意旨雖稱“伊於民國二十二年在蕪湖海員工會作事、至二十三年七八月間海員工會改組、伊即離蕪赴港擬找余亞儂謀事、適抵港時、余因事往廣州未及晤面、卽臥病旅邸、旋遇余立奎邀往寓所調養、詎寄居余家年馀、病亦未瘳、憶初到余家、係住永興街十號、後又遷往成河道六十九號、最後搬至霎東街七號、在此－年期內、王亞樵確會來過、因伊臥病、晒台門內見王次數亦不過多、伊所患之病、為香港脚腫症、週身發腫、終日睡臥、並未外出、亦未往巴炳頓道光明台豐富台等處開會及來京察看孫鳳鳴等情事”云云、然查其在余立奎家住居年餘、并與王亞樵晤面數次、當無不參與計劃之理、况該被告所患之香港腳腫症、據稱就獲時仍未告痊、伺以在香港拘留所時、並未向該所醫生報告、而在中央巡理府迭次出庭、又何以並無站立不便情形、此種顯非眞實之辯解事實、殊難認為可信、</p>
<p>至二十三年七月間、被告在蕪湖海員工會服務、無論有無確切證憑惟旣一再參與會議且為擔任察看工作、卽有一次未曾參與、亦不能阻却罪之成立、誠以被告等迭次開會、係出於概括之意思、不問對象為蔣為汪、均係在連續行為之中故凡參與該連續行為之一部、卽不失為實施殺人之共犯、該被告之行為應認為成立犯罪、</p>
<p>（四）張玉華部分查被告張玉華於本院訊問時、已自認“與華克之係朋友、王亚樵於一二八時、在上海晤面一次、二十四年在香港也会相遇一次當時興孫鳳鳴郭惠忠、由上海搭船同去、同住香港海陸涌旅館、於夜間在瓊崖商會與王亞樵晤面郭惠忠係伊往德安時邀來暗殺、先後共計三次、我均知悉在案被告除盧慶麒外（卽賀坡光劉書容李懷誠項仲霖等）亦皆知悉一、其在南京憲兵司令部所具之自白書、井將組織晨光通訊社之原因、置放兇器處所、及領取出入證、曁鼓勵伴送孫鳳鳴名情形、縷述無遺茲乃辯稱二次暗殺、均係孫鳳鳴之主張、孫鳳鳴利用晨光通訊社而實施殺害、並非晨光通訊社欲暗殺中央要人而利用孫鳳鳴等語顯係飾詞狡辯、無足取信、</p>
<p>况被告往德安邀郭惠忠時、曾對郭說明、孫鳳鳴刺蔣不成、花錢甚多擬邀其來京、擔任刺蔣工作、叉經郭惠忠到案證明如果行刺之事係孫鳳嗚一人主張、則孫之行為能否完成、與被告及晨光社並無何種關係、何必由其往贛代為邀人、加以被台在晨光社據其目己供述、伊非該社職員、不過與華克之相識、暫居該處而已、此言如係眞實、在孫鳳鳴固不能因利用晨光社而利用被告在該被舍亦必不至明知其利用通訊社而特為越俎代庖、此種毫不近情之抗辯意旨、尤難認為可信、（未完）</p>

<p>行駛上海湖州間立興內河輸船局之立順輸、於本月二十二日晨前一時、在江浙交界之俞匯地方、</p>
<p>被盜攔刼</p>
<p>損失財貨、在二千元以上、查內河輸船、近年雖刦案迭出、惟僅以搜刦旅客曁輸上銀錢飾物為止、其刦掠大宗客貨、尚以此次為創舉、本埠內河輸船業同業公會據報、已於昨晨、電呈江浙兩省府、請為飭屬跴緝、原文如下、江蘇省政府主席陳•浙江省政府主席朱•鈞鑒、敬呈者、茲據會員立典新記輪船局函報、該局立順輸船、於本月二十一日、拖帶客船及貨船數艘、由湖駛申、至午夜一時、行經離俞匯二十餘里之長河蕩地方、遇士匪船兩艘、其一形似艙船、一艘形似紹興船、載士匪十餘名、嗚槍示威、喝令停駛、蜂踴登越、開始搜刦、事後調查、計刦去湖綢四十餘疋、秉客現金飾物七八百元、船員衣服飾物三四百元、總計此次損失約值洋</p>

<h3>全國航業遭遇空前困難</h3>
<p>因受世界物價高漲影響　在萬不得已時酌增運費</p>
<p>新新社云、我國航業、因農村經濟稍蘇、營業得漸形發展、不若前數年之衰頹、豈料一般航商、正感興奮之際、復遭遇空前難關、記者特向航業界探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>船隻成本空前高漲</p>
<p>揆厥原因、實為世界物價高漲所致、㊀世界造船大量增加、海運建設、突飛猛晋、鋼鐵之需要、已達供不應求之勢、㊁輸船入塢修理、髹漆費用、較往年增加幾近一倍、㊂出租船隻、以四五千噸之輪船、去年每噸租金國幣三元者、現已漲至九元五角、漲度竟超出兩倍以上、其他瑣碎費用之增加、尚無從統計、故每一艘輪船之開支、亦隨之增高、</p>
<p>不增運費頗難維持</p>
<p>各航商處此種極度困雖之情勢下、頗感覺維持困難、蓋國內江海各航綫、因農村物產豐稔、經濟稍舒、輪往內地商品、及由內地輸出之農產、十分頻繁、所有船隻、每有不敷裝載、雖擬添造新輪、或租輪應付航運之需要、但終以現有行駛各輸、所入不敷所出、添購新船、更覺為難、故僉以在萬不得已時、擬酌增運費、以資營業之挹注、俾各航商得運用其船隻、謀公衆之利益、</p>
<p>國際航綫均增運費</p>
<p>又據航業界消息、此種航業界困難情形、已不僅中國方面為然、卽國際間航商、亦同受影響、故海洋各綫運輸之費用、早已一致高漲、如北美航綫、自日本至大西洋及大平洋各海岸、大西洋至還東間、及印度南美倫敦澳洲菲律賓等各綫、均定於五月一日起實行增加運費、</p>

<p>明年出貨</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>武裝起來！</h3>
<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>“我們為了保護國家的主權，為了保護財政命脈和國民工商經濟的稅收，我們對這無恥的走私，只有給以迎頭的痛擊。我們願意犧牲，我們願意走上緝私前綫作殊死戰，但我們不能這樣赤手空拳的奮門，我們希望政府把我們武裝起來！”</p>
<p>我們如果不是健忘，當遠記得海關人員上次所發表的宣言，這宣言是“獲得了全國各界熱烈的同情和援助。”但是不幸得很，這宣言發表之後，“海關”部份高級洋員，卽出面阻止，在“查究主動，物之外，“緝私人員在俱樂部開會商議應付辦法的時候，也有了監視，一同時關於緝私問題，須服從上級人員指揮，不得在未得上級人員指揮之前，擅自執行，釀成種種糾紛“而規定了所謂”妥善緝捕辦法”。——這“辦法”確會在兒玉先生回國所乘的上海丸上把查獲的銅元“送往海關沒收”過，此外，（我不想再抄錄新聞來浪費篇幅了，而且也是抄不勝抄的。）大概都是些一鐵尺與木棒齊飛一底“血腥的事寶”了！</p>
<p>但是我們可敬可愛的一經濟國防的第一綫上的戰士”是知道“擺在我面前的路，很明顯的只有一條，那就是一條艱苦的崎嶇的需要我們奮斗犧牲的路”，所以，卽使在“日鮮浪人的態度益見強橫的情況下，在“執行緝私俄任務的時候”，“對着這荊棘叢生的路，對着敵人鐵尺木棒短挺，不戰慄，不退縮，”“總覺得背後有全國同胞們殷殷屬望的眼睛和愛護備至的心意，於是更戰戰兢兢，不敢有負同胞們的期望”，“抱着極大的熱忱與毅力去完成這重大的使命！”</p>
<p>“但是，同胞們，你們的熱忱和援助除了溫暖我們的心靈外，我們是不能拿手和無恥兇惡的浪人們的鐵尺刺刀劉抗的呀！我們要你們的熱忱和援助，更需要武裝，我們是多麼迫切地需要武裝呀！是的！除非我們願意放棄“國家的主權”，除非我們愿意放棄“財政命脈和國民經濟的稅收”，事實擺在眼前，在這荊棘叢生的路上，不是“奮鬥犧牲”，便是“容忍退縮”。但是“經濟提携”的教訓，也足夠從“酷愛和平”的夢中醒來了；“希望”友邦“尊重我們的主權完整，以平等互惠的原則來待我，那惟有“奮鬥犧牲”，以毒可以攻毒，以榖然後止榖，所謂“用自己的血，去洗他人之手”，這是大家可以明白的。</p>
<p>希望政府把我們武裝起來，“使我們能更英勇地和卑鄙無恥的走私浪人作短兵相接的挺戰，我們相信是不會使我們失望的。”</p>
<p>是的！我們相信是不會使我們失望的！</p>
<h3>為棚戶呼籲和平</h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>棚戶之被人當作一個問題來看，恐怕還是在去年工部局勒令拆除草棚，因而引起的幾次流血大糾紛以後吧。因此，大家對這一問題便狹窄在“棚戶的產權，居住自由的被侵害”這一點上了。其實，如果我們明白“棚戶”這兩個字根本便不合理的話，我們早應在流血糾紛發生以前已謀這一問題的解決了。可惜我們的感覺便是這樣遲鈍，要在他們遭受更大的侵害時，才注意到這文明的社會有這麼的一種不合理的被侵害的人存在。然而，卽使遲，如果有澈底的解抉方法，那還是來得及：可惜我們的人，趁熱鬧的聽明的佔了大多數，雖說有了所謂棚戶問題，可是一次二次，一天二天，這樣又挨延了下來，到現有還是未解决，且更嚴重化了。那麼，卽使是知道了這的的確確是一個不是小的問題，那又於事實何補？</p>
<p>工部局拆棚的决定，據說是“工部局董事會議决的計劃，”所以“碍難收回成命。”而且，那限期便要來了，“五月三日起仍將照原定計劃先將蘭路以西引翔路一帶草棚五百戶拆除：然後限期二月再拆蘭路以東朝陽路等處草棚。”這樣看來，真的便是非拆不可，亦卽所謂“態度強硬”了。</p>
<p>當然，拆棚自有拆棚的理由，但是在拆棚的時候，因為雙方的僵持，必有所謂不幸事件”的發生。現在，拆棚限期沒有幾天了，我們能坐視着一幕流血慘劇的到來嗎？所謂“文明”，大概總不是不講理：要講理，自然不會讓問題陷於僵局。讓我們便為棚戶呼籲和平吧。</p>
<p>二十六日，滬東棚户七百馀人是向工部局大請願了。那请願呈文大略是這樣的：“鈞局曾議建築平民住宅，以謀代替草棚。現無故取消成議，堅決拆除，民心奚甘？鈞局為法治機關，不能出令毀令，置棚戶於死地，而不願念平民生計，專為資產着想，拆除無所謂的草棚，不念民艱，引起無謂糾紛。社會不安，影響工商，破壞秩序，非棚戶故意為之，實鈞局有意造成，未可預料的危險，鈞局當負完全責任。”本來，拆棚為了“整飭市容”，或者謀衛生清潔都可說得過去，如果“專為資產着想”，那却未能同情了，但願這消息不是眞的。同時，前此解次拆棚後的棚戶住居問題，曾議建平民住宅的補救方法，這是合理的，然而“無故取消成議”，又不知是為了什麼事故了。</p>
<p>同時，最費解的還是“棚戶等以工部局仍不允收回成命，代表五人乃提出由四千餘棚戶，每戶每月繳費五角，一年六元，集存於工部局或其他機關，於十年後由工部局將棚戶所集存之欵項建造平民村，”這一辦法也未被採納，只允“考盧”。這眞呌棚戶無“步”可“讓”了，離道眞的非要他一家數口浪蕩街頭不可嗎？那可怪不要棚戶的最後表示却是“工部局若再無圓滿答覆，將一致誓死不允拆除草棚。”和平到了最後，當然便是自衛了。</p>
<p>現在，距離“最後”還有幾天，我們希望：第一，工部局有“圓滿答覆”。否則，第二，但願一般事後出馬的人，早一點來車前解决，要不然我們眞不忍看那“未可預料的危險”。</p>
<h3>分水嶺上</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>—山行雜什</p>
<p>着鬰怨的情緒，走上泥鰍樣的雨後的路。</p>
<p>往上看了一下，還有漫長的一段路程吶！我們就在破爛的草鞋上又加了一雙新的，扶了伕頭的桃木棍子，跨過分水嶺。</p>
<p>“分水”鬧不清分的究竟是那條水，嶺呢？實在也夠慚愧，說不上高視羣峯，正相反的却被羣峯高視着。然而牠有天然的那麼一條界綫，蜿蜒的從這個關日向兩頭伸張過去，劃破了服下來的青空，把連亘的山頭，分成了爾個集團。</p>
<p>一到分水嶺，情况就有點下同，山路上，沿了山壁以及田畝的邊綠，翠綠的樹和不知名的花草緊遮了路徑，幽靜得像公園的甬道。望着满山的娇綠，我們停下來，由於習慣，知道又是進中飯的時分了。</p>
<p>村子簡直小得可怜，菜自然不用多說，有碗鹽煮豆腐花，已經算“很不錯的樣子”，飯却發生了重大的問題，存米有限，五六十張嘴，就難以應付。之後，由村子里的鄰舍們湊集起來，才算應過了這重要的難開。</p>
<p>一•侮辱</p>
<p>進中飯，在時間上不免有比較長久的逗留。伕子們對這逗留，成了特赥的機會，三三兩兩地走入“卜一女子火西士，西女王見金戈戈”的烟館里去，在他們的習慣上，吃黑飯是重於白飯的。不願同流的我們呢？當然也不甘悶坐在連名字都沒有的小村子里，性情相近的，偕同着，一股住東，一股住西，散開了。</p>
<p>老鐵和我沿了村子背後的生疏小路，一個大包圍兜抄過去，在村西的一道籬笆外面，正圍了不少的人，遠遠地就投過來一種漫罵的聲浪，音波相當的高昂，似乎有什麼不可述說的憤怨，同時，另－種還帶有孩子味的調子揚起來在嚴厲的辨駁着。好奇催促着，慌忙的趕過去，又那里想得到呢，圍在垓心的，竟是不滿二十的小孫呵！</p>
<p>為點什麼呢？一個還沒有覓過世面的孩子，而且又處在山野生疏的環境里，似乎不致有開罪旁人的地方吧？但現在，不容你理想，他竟被包圍了，竟接受着無情的責罵，以情勢看去，好像因了他的辯駁認為那是多餘，說不定還要試一下“老拳”的味道。終於小孫，說出了這事故的主要原因，是為了他要大便，在這籬笆里的坑子上。進去時候，想不到一個年青的少婦却正在“方便”，於是，他惶恐的跑出來，誰又知道這一跑竟成了不可容恕的禍根呢！</p>
<p>——在這里，男女的界限被看得極淡的，除非在行動上你污辱了女子的身體，將會受到些懲罰，所謂懲罰，也要看情節的輕重才能評斷的。平時，大小便的地方用不着分開來的，大家都是父母清白下遺留的身體，又何必那樣神秘做什麼呢？這話，是一個老者說的，他把眼睛向四下里溜了一下：所以，在遇到女人方便的時候，那是無關緊要的，你只管照舊的我行我素，要不然，那就是你認為這女大的身體並不清白，換句話說，也就有無限的侮辱成分！對這侮辱，由於習俗上的慣例，是要加以責罰的。他畢竟是一位老者，懂禮，語氣也和緩得多了。</p>
<p>跟着，我們解释着過路的行旅對於一切的風俗不能预知的苦楚，還懇求他疏通勸解。跟着，阿黄他們一夥來了，伕子也来了不少•大概是人多势衆，我們的气燄就盛起來，而他們，却軟化下去，本來還预備“罚”一回的，倒现在也都雨散雲收了、</p>
<p>回到村里，禁不住的我们都笑了，在偏僻的小村里，居然還有奇妙的演出吶！</p>

<h3>The Relocation of the Former Northeast Army Has Concluded</h3>
<p>He Yingqin's Remarks: Personnel, Management, Education, etc., will henceforth be handled by the Central Government. Generals have sent telegrams to the capital expressing absolute obedience to orders.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Following the Executive Yuan meeting on the 27th, which approved the appointments of Yu Xuezhong as Pacification Commissioner of Jiangsu, He Zhuguo as Deputy Director of the Xi'an Headquarters, and Wang Shuchang as Deputy Pacification Commissioner of Henan and Anhui, as well as the appointments of Liu Zhi and others as members of the Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu Military Reorganization Committee, reporters, believing the relocation of the former Northeast Army to the east had reached its conclusion, paid a special visit to Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin. He received them and made the following remarks, stating roughly that the various units of the Northeast Army, having received orders to move east and having been assigned new tasks by the Central Government, would henceforth have their personnel, management, education, and other major affairs directly under the Central Government. In terms of personnel, matters would be handled strictly in accordance with personnel regulations, ensuring a greater level of security for the promotion, transfer, and replenishment of officers at all levels. In terms of management, under the principle of not reducing the original funding, the system of actual cost management would be implemented so that officers and soldiers at all levels could gradually achieve the ability to receive salaries in accordance with national crisis salary standards. As for the personnel of the former Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters, in addition to those who could be transferred to serve in various units, the remainder would be re-employed at their original rank and salary, ensuring that their livelihoods would not be affected. He personally had been in charge of the Beiping Military Branch for more than two years and had very close personal relationships with the Northeast comrades, recalling that during those two years, every word and deed was taken with utmost responsibility, and he believed that a deep impression still remained in the minds of all his comrades. After the Central Government issued the clear orders, he had telegraphed Yu Xuezhong, He Zhuguo, Liu Binquan, Miao Zhengliu, and Wu Ke Ren in his personal capacity, and today he received replies expressing absolute obedience to the Central Government's orders, demonstrating the clear understanding of the nation and ethnicity among the Northeast comrades and the sincerity of their support for the leader. From now on, by uniting sincerely and working together, the Northeast comrades would surely become a strong force in the National Army, and so on. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi's Plan to Go Abroad Has Been Cancelled</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] According to Guan Naihua, Bai Chongxi had originally planned to go abroad, but the Central Government's retention led to its cancellation. Guangxi has decided to implement a military industrial policy, designating Mo Shujie's division to be responsible for mining, and Xu Qiming's, Qu Shounian's, and Cheng Xiefen's divisions to build roads.

<h3>The First Batch of Duty-Free Foreign Rice Arrived in Guangzhou Yesterday</h3>

<p>[Hong Kong] The first batch of 8,000 bags of duty-free foreign rice arrived in the province on the 28th morning via Hong Kong ships. Rice merchants are still crowding to register with customs. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway plans to run special trains to transport rice to the province. Hong Kong rice merchants exchanged opinions on the 28th and decided to telegraph the authorities to strictly investigate the corruption case in the Guangdong People's Food Adjustment Committee.

<p>[Hong Kong] Guangdong has ordered the arrest of Xiong Li. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Xiong Li, the Secretary of the Guangdong People's Food Adjustment Committee, has been dismissed from all his concurrent positions by the authorities for private gain and corruption. Xiong has left Guangdong. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Liu Zhi Issues a Written Statement</h3>
<p>[Kaifeng] Liu Zhi, the newly appointed Chairman of the Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu Military Reorganization Committee, issued a written statement on the 28th, stating in essence that he had received formal orders. The Central Government's motivation for reorganizing the troops stationed in the three provinces was that the newly transferred units had been engaged in bandit suppression for too long, neglecting training, and some units' organization did not comply with Central Government regulations. The nature of the committee is to be an advisory body to Committee Chairman Zeng of the Military Affairs Commission, responsible for suggesting reorganization matters. The content of the suggestions will be jointly discussed after all the committee members arrive in Kaifeng next month. He himself will act with sincerity and impartiality in accordance with the Central Government's intentions. The committee members are all prominent figures in the party and the nation with profound insights and foresight, and the reorganization will proceed smoothly. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Pacification Headquarters Will Be Established in Huaiyin</h3>

<h3>Xu Baiyuan Has Escaped Danger in the Kidnapping Case on the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway</h3>
<p>The Victim Was Hidden in Dawu Mountain, Anji. Military and Police Received Information and Went to Ambush. A Brief Encounter in the Bamboo Forest. Bandits Abandoned the Victim and Fled Without a Trace. There are also Rumors that Xu Shihua Has Been Released, but This Has Not Been Confirmed.</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] Since the kidnapping case on the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway occurred on the 18th of this month, the Zhejiang Provincial authorities have ordered the military, police, and various agencies to spare no effort in searching for clues. During this ten-day period, special attention has been paid to all major roads and inside and outside the city walls. Yesterday afternoon, military police were searching pedestrians in front of Pan Si in Hangzhou when they caught sight of a man whose movements were suspicious. Upon questioning, he stammered and gave evasive answers. The man was detained and taken back to the Security Bureau. Under interrogation, he confessed that his name was An Lao Er, and that he was in charge of guarding the victims, Xu Baiyuan and Xu Shihua, after they were kidnapped. Because the military and police searches were urgent, the bandits, fearing they could not hold out, ordered him to go to Hangzhou to inform their accomplices and ask for reinforcements. Unexpectedly, his actions were discovered by the military police and he was arrested. He also confessed that the bandit leader's surname was Zhou, and that he had served as the captain of a river patrol team. The victim was currently hidden near Dawu Mountain in Anji. After obtaining this information, the Security Bureau immediately dispatched a large team of armed military police, escorted the criminal, and ordered him to lead the way to encircle and suppress the bandits. They arrived at their destination around 5:00 AM this morning and discovered that the bandits and the victim had already been moved. A search was conducted everywhere, but no trace was found. Later, they saw a large bamboo forest near a small village in the area and immediately surrounded it, dividing into four groups to search the forest. Unexpectedly, Xu Baiyuan and three bandits were hiding in the forest. When they saw the military police crouching and advancing, the bandits opened fire. The military police returned fire, but the bandits, feeling guilty, abandoned the victim and fled into the dense bamboo forest without a trace. At that time, Xu Baiyuan also crawled out of the bamboo forest, shouting for help. The soldiers of the Security Team heard him, went to help him up, and escorted him out. He then boarded a Security Bureau police car and was escorted to the residence of Zhu Jiahao, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, in Huzhou to rest. It was about 7:00 AM. After a brief wash and a light meal, he was still guarded by the soldiers of the Security Team and arrived in Hangzhou around 7:00 PM. He was in good spirits, but his hands and feet were slightly scratched by bamboo roots and branches due to crawling and dodging in the bamboo forest. He personally received visitors. According to him, the kidnapping was accidental. The bandits' target was two prominent figures in the business community, but that day, they were waiting on the road and it suddenly started to rain, and there was no news of the two men passing by, so they shifted their target to Xu and Xu Binhua. Four bandits made the move and escorted Xu and others away that night, passing through Huangwei Mountain. It was already dark, so they spent the night alone in a nearby thatched shed. Before leaving, the bandits paid the owner of the shed more than 20 yuan for food and lodging. On the 19th, when the military police went to the mountain to search, they exchanged fire with each other. At that time, he and others were escorted by the bandits along a small road to escape, heading directly to Anji. They traveled at night and rested during the day, and arrived at Dawu Mountain on the morning of the 21st. Usually, three or four bandits closely followed them. The treatment was not bad. The clothes they were wearing and gold rings were all discarded. The bandit leader had very generous means. Xu Binhua is also safe. It was rumored that Xu had also escaped danger around 10:00 AM this morning, but this could not be confirmed. However, the military police are still continuing their search in the area, so it is expected that he will also be able to escape danger. Later, according to Xuan Tiewu, Director of the Security Bureau, the cracking of this case involved many twists and turns. Now that the victim has been safely rescued, it is a great relief. However, it has been found that the bandits have extensive influence, and there are communication agencies and accomplices of such people in Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. Therefore, the bandits are very aware of the movements of the military police. The bandit leader, Zhou, is a habitual offender. Although he has escaped, it is believed that he will be arrested soon. The bandits are mainly residents of Shengxian and Taizhou. Since the kidnapping occurred, among the 14 suspects who have been arrested, it has been discovered that there is one actual perpetrator. As for the head of the eighth Baojia in Yu Hang, because he was threatened by the bandits and communicated with them, secretly passing on information, he has also been escorted to the province to await investigation. The escaped bandits are now being strictly pursued and arrested everywhere, and they will be brought to justice. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] Xu Baiyuan told reporters on the evening of the 28th that Xu Binhua also escaped danger at 4:00 PM on the 28th. Xu suffered minor injuries and has gone to Shanghai for medical treatment. After they were kidnapped, they were treated well by the bandits. The two of them never separated in the bandits' lair. It is considered a fortunate escape that they were able to escape danger one after another. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] As a result of the Security Bureau's efforts to rescue them, Xu Baiyuan and Xu Baohua escaped danger late on the 27th. Xu and Xu are expected to come to Hangzhou on the evening of the 28th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<h3>Two Committees of the Legislative Yuan Pass the National Assembly Laws and Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>Separate Examination Reports are Prepared and Submitted to the Yuan Meeting for Deliberation Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The 22-member committee specially established by the Legislative Yuan to examine and revise the two National Assembly laws held a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 28th in the lounge of the Yuan's Assembly Hall. Committee members Cheng Zhongxing, Yang Gongda, Lin Bosheng, Liu Guanxun, Shi Weihuan, Huang Youchang, Chen Guyuan, Wang Kunlun, Wu Yinchu, Lv Zhiyi, Shi Shangkuan, Liu Kejun, Lin Bin, and Dong Qizheng attended. The convener, Chuan Bingchang, chaired the meeting and reported on the preliminary review of the two laws conducted by Lin Bin and other drafters of the original draft of the National Assembly Organization Law and the Representative Election Law, based on the revision points issued by the Central Government. Secretary Bao Decheng then read the revised text of the preliminary review of the two laws. Except for one article that was slightly modified in wording, the rest were passed according to the results of the preliminary review. The meeting adjourned after an hour. The 20 articles of the National Assembly Organization Law and the 60 articles in eight chapters of the Representative Election Law, after being examined and revised, have now been drafted into examination reports and submitted to the Yuan's meeting for deliberation on the morning of the 30th. Furthermore, the eight-member committee specially established by the Yuan to examine and revise the draft constitution also held a meeting at 10:30 AM on the 28th in the lounge of the Assembly Hall. Committee members Ma Yinchu, Liang Hancao, Lin Bin, Wu Shangying, and others attended. The convener, Chuan Bingchang, chaired the meeting and deleted Article 146 of the draft constitution, "The powers of the first National Assembly shall be exercised by the National Assembly that formulates the constitution," in accordance with the Central Government's decision. The two articles after the original Article 146 were renamed as Article 146 and Article 147 in sequence. There were no other changes. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. The results of this examination have also been drafted into a report and submitted to the Yuan's meeting for joint deliberation on the morning of the 30th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The revised draft of the National Assembly Organization and Representative Election Law was reviewed for the second time by Lin Bin and other drafters of the Legislative Yuan on the 28th. Based on the principles handed down by the Central Government, it was passed according to the preliminary review. Article 1 of the Organization Law was revised to state that the National Assembly formulates the constitution and decides the date of implementation of the constitution. The original Articles 3 and 4 were merged into Article 2, with slight revisions to the text. A new Article 11 was added to state that the National Assembly shall end its term after the meeting is over and the task is completed. There were no other changes. The Representative Election Law was also revised, and the entire text was consolidated into 60 articles. Article 146 of the draft constitution was deleted in accordance with the Central Government's decision. The rest remained the same. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chuan Bingchang told reporters on the 28th that the comrades' examination and deletion of the draft constitution and the two National Assembly laws were entirely based on the Central Government's resolutions and the revision points issued. Therefore, the comrades were only responsible for legislative technical matters during the examination. The reasons for the deletion and revision of the three cases this time are political issues, not legal issues. In particular, the clear division of the powers of the National Assembly that formulates the constitution and the powers of the first National Assembly is the most appropriate. At the beginning of drafting the National Assembly Organization Law, the Yuan deeply worried that the exercise of the powers of the National Assembly stipulated in the teachings by the National Assembly not formed in accordance with the teachings would be suspected of taking excerpts from the teachings out of context. However, they also feared that after the end of the National Assembly that formulates the constitution, the first National Assembly would be convened separately in accordance with the constitution, which would not be affordable with the current manpower and financial resources. For the sake of expediency, there was a provision that the powers of the first National Assembly should be exercised by the National Assembly that formulates the constitution, so that one meeting would bear the tasks of two meetings. Now that it is stipulated that those who formulate the constitution are only limited to formulating the constitution and determining the date of implementation of the constitution, not only can the representatives who formulate the constitution focus their thoughts and talents to complete their task of formulating the constitution for building the country, but it can also promote the convening of the first National Assembly in the future, entirely based on the teachings, so that each county and city can have at least one representative to participate. Chuan also said that since the powers of the National Assembly have been changed, the number of representatives participating in this election will be relatively reduced.

<h3>The German-Italian Axis and the Central European Political Situation</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>In recent days, politicians from various Central European countries have been visiting each other and holding talks, as if some major event is about to occur, and they must urgently seek ways to remedy the situation. For example, British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to Belgium, French Defense Minister Daladier's visit to England, Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Schmidt's visit to Mussolini, German General Göring's visit to Rome, the Polish Foreign Minister's visit to Romania, the Hungarian Defense Minister's travels between Berlin and Vienna, and the Italian Foreign Minister's visit to Albania have all occurred in the past few days. In the near future, the Yugoslav Prime Minister will visit Rome, the German Foreign Minister will visit Italy, and Mussolini, who rarely leaves the country, will also visit Berlin. What exactly is the reason for these politicians and diplomats' whirlwind activities?</p>
<p>In short, these politicians' mutual visits are a manifestation of the turbulent European political situation. The most obvious development in recent European politics is the increasing power of the German-Italian axis. The German-Italian axis was formed to counter the peace axis of England, France, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia. Its structure is built upon the Rome Protocols of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, the German-Austrian Agreement, and the German-Italian Agreement. Recently, Germany and Italy have been striving to consolidate the organization of this axis on one hand and attempting to expand its influence on the other. To achieve the former goal, there were talks between the Austrian Chancellor and Mussolini, and General Göring's visit to Italy. During the Italian-Austrian talks, Mussolini strongly urged Austria to abandon its political agreement with Czechoslovakia and change its anti-German policy because Austria is a bridge for German-Italian cooperation. If Austria adopts an anti-German, pro-Czech policy, the German-Italian axis could be interrupted at any time. Now, after the Italian-Austrian talks, Austria's attitude seems to have changed slightly. At the same time, the results of Göring's visit to Italy have also significantly improved the prospects for German-Italian cooperation.</p>
<p>This is in terms of consolidating the power of the German-Italian axis. As for the work of Germany and Italy expanding the influence of this axis, it is also being actively promoted. Last month, Italy and Yugoslavia established a political and economic agreement, gradually drawing the Belgrade authorities, who previously opposed Italy, into the fascist fold. Recently, Italy has also been actively wooing Romania, attempting to establish a political and economic agreement of the same nature as the Italian-Yugoslav agreement. The visit of the Polish Foreign Minister Beck, who is strongly pro-German, to Rome is likely related to this matter. If Romania also falls into the fascist sphere of influence like Yugoslavia in the future, then the unity of the Allied powers will be completely dismantled.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the recent developments in Central Europe, the power of the aggressive German-Italian axis seems to be gradually consolidating and expanding. This fact is certainly unfavorable to the prospects for international peace. However, we believe that although Germany and Italy have common interests in dealing with England, France, and the Soviet Union, their conflicting interests in Central Europe and the Balkans are very sharp, and there is still the possibility of a falling out at any time. Moreover, Austria's anti-German attitude will not completely change due to Italy's persuasion. This is evident from Schuschnigg's statement after returning home opposing the National Socialist Party joining the Fatherland Front. Since the death of the pro-German Gömbös in Hungary, anti-German sentiment has been very strong, which is also a major obstacle to German-Italian cooperation. In addition, England, France, and the Soviet Union will certainly not stand idly by regarding the recent active diplomacy of Germany and Italy. They will definitely try to prevent the expansion of the axis's power. Eden's visit to Belgium this time carries the mission of preventing Belgium from falling into the German sphere of influence. At the same time, France and the Soviet Union will also take counter-offensive diplomatic actions in Southeast Europe to prevent the German-Italian axis from developing smoothly. Therefore, although Germany and Italy have been very active in diplomacy recently, the future is not very optimistic.</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Plans to Compromise with Political Parties</h3>
<p>Postponing Special Session of Diet to Facilitate Progress. No Decision on Resignation or Dissolution</p>
<p>[Tokyo] It is generally expected that after the general election, a head-on conflict between the government and political parties will be unavoidable, and the only options will be the cabinet's resignation or the Diet's dissolution. However, according to government policy, it intends to deal with the domestic and international situation based on policy and hopes that political parties will act prudently. Regarding the issue of resignation or dissolution, no decision has been made. Therefore, the government believes that convening a special session of the Diet need not be rushed, but can be held after establishing the Hayashi cabinet's own policies and presenting a new image. The deadline for the government to convene a special session of the Diet is within five months of the dissolution of the Diet. According to the government's current view, the special session can be convened in August, the maximum time limit. This move by the government can be interpreted as follows: During the period from the general election to the special session of the Diet, if the formation of a new party cannot be realized, it hopes for the softening of political parties and intends to compromise with political parties during this period. (Allied Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] In some areas where the general election is being held, there is no need for voting because the number of candidates in those districts is within the number of seats, and there is no need for a competitive election. However, in the remaining 118 districts, voting will be held uniformly on the 30th of this month, except for areas where transportation is inconvenient and voting will be held early. Among them, the election or defeat of candidates in 70 districts (with 299 seats to be elected) can be decided on May 1. The ballot boxes in the remaining 48 districts (with 155 seats to be elected) will also be fully opened and counted on the 2nd to determine the winners. Therefore, the new distribution of power among the political parties can only be determined on the evening of the 2nd. (Allied Press dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Japan Completes Another Giant Aircraft: Morning Breeze No. 1</h3>
<p>Sister Aircraft to the Kamikaze</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Asahi Shimbun's order for another single-wing aircraft, "Morning Breeze" No. 1, from the Nagoya Aircraft Factory has been completed.

According to the pilot, Yamaguchi, who previously tested the "Kamikaze", the new aircraft is comparable to the "Kamikaze".

<h3>The Zeppelin Flies Over Swiss Territory</h3>
<p>Swiss People Extremely Indignant, Consider It a German Act of Provocation</p>
<p>⊙Berne, Switzerland:  The German Zeppelin airship, which has been flying between the country and the Americas for some time, recently flew over Schaffhausen during Swiss army exercises.  The Swiss Telegraph Agency, attached to the military headquarters (on the banks of the Rhine), issued a message stating that the Zeppelin flew over our country's territory at low altitude during our army exercises, which is highly suspicious.

<h3>Western Rebel Army Advances Triumphantly, Port of Bilbao in Critical Danger</h3>
<p>Over a Hundred Planes Drop a Thousand Bombs, Northern City Reduced to a Field of Rubble</p>
<p>⊙Hendaye:  The battle for Bilbao is becoming increasingly critical today. The Basque defenders now have only 15,000 men remaining. They are retreating entirely. If the 80,000-man militia reserve force is not quickly mobilized to replenish them, the port of Bilbao will fall imminently.  The Northern Rebel Army Commander Mola announced today that 7,000 prisoners have been captured in the past two days. (National Telegram of the 28th)</p>
<p>⊙Hendaye: Bilbao, the main port in northern Spain, may fall within hours as the Nationalist forces continue to advance. Last night, they reached Vitoria, located only sixteen miles east of Bilbao. Reports indicate that the Basque army's retreat is resembling a rout.  The Nationalist forces claim that no fewer than 5,000 Basque soldiers have surrendered in the past three days.  The Basque government has appealed to Valencia for assistance, requesting that as many fighter planes as possible be sent within forty hours, otherwise, the Basque government will be forced to take actions it deems necessary.  Meanwhile, the President of the Basque Government issued a message to the nation, with very poignant words, stating that all Basques will react violently to the bombing of their undefended ancient capital, Guernica, and will swear in their hearts to defend their own survival. It is reported that Guernica was bombed yesterday by Nationalist airplanes dropping over a thousand high-explosive bombs and countless incendiary grenades, completely destroying it.  The aerial attack lasted five and a half hours, and the entire city has become a field of rubble, with hundreds of residents killed, mostly women and children.

Several hundred members of their affiliated militias have also mutinied and deserted. (Havas dispatch of the 28th from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>⊙Bilbao:  The government army militia on the Marquina front is putting up strong resistance. Although the Nationalist forces launched an offensive at one point, they ultimately failed. On the Durango front, the two sides are still engaged in artillery battles, with the government army resisting resolutely and without retreating at all.

<p>⊙Bilbao:  The city of Guernica in the Basque Autonomous Region, a historically famous city, was bombed yesterday by several airplanes belonging to the Nationalist forces, dropping no fewer than a thousand bombs over a period of eight hours. The San Clara Monastery and affiliated hospital, as well as the Churches of Saint John and Santa Maria, were all hit and destroyed. A large number of civilian houses caught fire. The airplanes also strafed with machine guns at an altitude of forty meters, and the residents fled in panic, a truly tragic sight.  Officials of the Basque Autonomous Region government have recently stated that there were a total of 120 airplanes, piloted by Germans.  After the city was bombed, it was covered in devastation. Cultural institutions such as libraries, museums, and archives were all destroyed, which is truly regrettable.  (Havas dispatch of the 28th from Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Italian-German Talks Did Not Achieve Concrete Results</h3>
<p>Waiting for the Development of the Spanish War, Eden's Visit to Belgium Yielded Good Results</p>
<p>[Rome] General Goering, the German Minister of Aviation, has held discussions with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano on various issues since arriving here yesterday. He is scheduled to depart for Florence tonight. It is reported that these meetings have not yielded any concrete results because the Spanish war is fluctuating and it is necessary to wait for subsequent developments. (Reuters dispatch of the 27th from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Following Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to Brussels, the Belgian government has decided to remain loyal to the League of Nations. This has been unanimously praised by the newspapers here. The Times wrote, "Although Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to this country was very brief, the results were better than those of previous visits to other countries because both sides developed several constructive factors and decided to focus on promoting international cooperation. It seems that after careful study by the foreign affairs authorities of the two countries, negotiations can be conducted according to a new procedure." The Liberal Party's News Chronicle wrote, "Although the people of Belgium are now eagerly awaiting Germany to follow Britain and France in guaranteeing Belgian security, they are unwilling to abandon the League of Nations Covenant as the price. Therefore, the League of Nations Covenant has once again become the golden rule of European diplomacy. The people of Britain, France, and Belgium now hope that other countries can also accept this rule. If a country bases its proposals for negotiations or guarantees on other principles, then the three countries of Britain, France, and Belgium cannot but doubt the sincerity of such proposals and guarantees."

<h3>U.S. Army Expenses Increased</h3>
<p>Totaling Over 416 Million Yuan, Expanding the Air Force and Mechanized Military Equipment</p>
<p>[Washington] The House Appropriations Committee today approved the War Department's budget of $416,443,382, an increase of $25,129,567 compared to last year. However, compared to the original amount requested, it has been reduced by $358,079. The committee's report solemnly stated that the increased budget for this year is necessary to maintain an adequate national defense force because the current national defense system is "insufficient to resist attacks from modern weapons." As for the items that have been increased, the most important are expanding the size of the army, increasing the air force, replacing outdated military equipment, and adding army airfields. It is reported that Army Chief of Staff General Craig had requested the Army Committee to increase the number of officers by two thousand to maintain a force of fourteen thousand. The budget for the air force in the current budget proposal is $67,075,514, which includes the cost of purchasing 513 airplanes. Craig also stated that the army, due to financial constraints, is prepared to abandon all large airships and will continue to use balloons for the time being. Once other methods, such as vertical takeoff and landing airplanes, become available, a new policy will be determined. The budget proposal still allocates $1,050,447 for the Philippine defense force. The War Department stated in this regard that the department's current policy is to maintain the existing strength. The future course of action will depend on the government's policy on Philippine independence. The United States has invested a great deal in the Philippines, and the government has a responsibility to protect it before the end of the transition period. (National Telegram of the 27th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Women Go to the Far East!!</h3>
<p>A Letter from a Military Officer's Wife Arouses National Attention</p>
<p>▲ TASS Moscow dispatch of April 2nd: A public letter recently published in the newspaper by Comrade Kitaigorova, the wife of an officer in the Far East Special Red Army, has attracted the attention of women across the country. The letter calls on women to go to the Far East to help develop the sparsely populated new land. It says, "We and our husbands and brothers are building this amazing region on the Far East coast and in the forests along the Heilongjiang River. Not long ago, only deer, pigs, tigers, and wolves roamed here, but now there are new cities, new roads, and impregnable reinforced concrete fortresses protecting the Soviet border stations. Dear friends, I and all the people of the Far East jointly ask you to come here. We need blacksmiths, lathe operators, teachers, pattern makers, typists, accountants, clerks, artists, brave and willing people to sacrifice. There are amazing jobs, amazing people, and an amazing future waiting for you!"</p>
<p>In response to this letter, tens of millions of women immediately wrote to the Moscow representative office of the Far East region and the regional executive committee of Boli, requesting to go there to serve. The first group arrived in Boli on March 15. They came from Pyatigorsk and said, "We saw the news about the Far East and the new city of Komsomolsk in the newspapers. We have long been yearning for it. Ms. Kitaigorova's letter is exactly what we needed. We are going to Komsomolsk now. We are not afraid of any difficulties. You can rest assured."</p>
<p>On March 23, the second group of women set off from Moscow for the Far East. On the same day, Ms. Makashakova, who works on underground construction projects, went to the Far East representative office and said,</p>
<p>"I am prepared to go immediately today."</p>
<p>"What can you do?"</p>
<p>"I am a driller and a reinforced concrete worker. I can operate pipe-laying machines. I am a graduate of a higher education institution. I can now fly airplanes and parachute. I can shoot, and I can hit the target forty times out of fifty..."</p>
<p>Ms. Ma will soon go to the Far East. From then on, large and small groups of women, teachers, accountants, cooks, and librarians are preparing to create a new life in the Soviet Far East, regardless of difficulties.</p>
<h3>French Government Decides to Adopt Economically Conservative Policies</h3>
<p>Social Reform Undertakings Temporarily Postponed, Curtailing Government Expenses to Restore Fiscal Credit</p>
<p>[Paris] The government has recently made a firm decision to adopt a more conservative economic policy in domestic affairs in order to satisfy the domestic middle class and bondholders. This policy will be supported by all parties joining the Popular Front, such as the Radical Socialist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party. This can be seen from the results of today's meeting of the delegation of left-wing parties in the National Assembly. During the meeting this afternoon, Gambin, Chairman of the Radical Socialist Party's delegation in the Chamber of Deputies, expressed his views. The representatives of all attending parties, including the Communist Party, unanimously expressed their support for Gambin's declaration, which can be divided into two points: ㊀ Various social reform undertakings that involve large expenditures should be carried out only after the people of the whole country have become accustomed to the various social reform undertakings that the government has carried out over the past eleven months. Therefore, the policy of a so-called "breathing period" should be adopted at present, which is what Prime Minister Blum determined two months ago. ㊁ The various political parties should reach a compromise and implement a political truce for at least the next six months in order to ease the atmosphere in all aspects and allow fiscal credit to be restored. In addition, Prime Minister Blum will deliver an important political speech in the Chamber of Deputies on May 5 or 6, explaining the main principles of the government's future social and economic policies. The basic focus of these principles will be strict curtailment of government expenses. Therefore, various social reform undertakings that involve large expenditures, such as pension funds, should be temporarily postponed, and the plan proposed by the General Confederation of Labor to issue bonds worth 100 billion francs to expand various public works projects should be abandoned. In order to achieve the complete restoration of fiscal credit, it is necessary for the country to have a sufficient period of time to allow the new social legislation to be "digested." General observers firmly believe that Prime Minister Blum's declaration will be approved without reservation by the majority parties in the National Assembly, thereby strengthening the government's position. This can already be seen from the situation at today's meeting of the delegation of left-wing parties. (Havas dispatch of the 27th from Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Cloudy but No Rain in Chahar Province, North</h3>
<p>A Certain Party Releases a Smokescreen of War Preparations, De Wang and Li Shou-hsin Oust Each Other</p>
<p>Zhangbei Correspondence: The recent situation in Chahar Province, North, although the atmosphere is tense, the international situation does not seem to be very serious. The reason for this is partly due to the mutual ousting of De Wang and Li Shou-hsin, and partly due to the undecided national policy of a certain party. Therefore, they deliberately release a smokescreen, and the preparations for requisitioning vehicles, transferring troops, transporting arms, and storing grain are all for this reason. Therefore, the recent situation in Chahar Province, North, is like a cloudy but no rain. The recent news is summarized below:</p>
<p>A Certain Party Bestows Small Favors</p>
<p>A certain party has always attached great importance to transportation related to the military in Chahar Province, North. The highways between the various counties have long been completed one after another. Now, because there is no direct and convenient highway between Zhanyuan and Zhangbei, it is quite inconvenient. They are actively requisitioning laborers to rush to build the Zhanggu Highway. Once completed, the troops, leather goods, and private goods entering Chahar from Rehe can directly reach Zhangbei and instantly reach Zhangjiakou, providing great convenience for their transportation. At the same time, they are also aware of the unrest among the puppet troops in Chahar Province, North, and the grievances of the people. Therefore, one party provides the puppet organization with timely salaries and provisions, while the other party orders the puppet organization to collect large quantities of food from the counties of Zhangbei, Baoyuan (the renamed combined counties of Baochang and Guyuan), and Dolon, and transport them to the Daqinggou Nanhouchang, Shangdu, and other places in the war zone. The people who have suffered losses in the war are given two dou of relief grain per villager, and about a thousand stones are released every day. Those who take from us turn around and bestow small favors on us. The people of Chahar Province, North, must have understood this cunning scheme that costs nothing.</p>
<p>De Wang and Li Shou-hsin's Discord Becomes Obvious</p>
<p>Although Li Shou-hsin is a Mongolian, he was born in Rehe. With the status of a guest army, he mingled in Chahar Province, North. In the past, he, De Wang, and Wang Ying formed a three-legged balance of power. De Wang, moreover, considers himself a Mongolian prince and has long regarded himself as the landlord. He has long held the idea that "one cannot tolerate others snoring beside one's bed." Now that Wang Ying has left, only Li remains. So, when a certain party decided to reorganize the puppet army this year, he encouraged a certain party to secretly take away Li's military power and give him the empty titles of Deputy Military Commander and Mayor of Dehua City. However, most of the division commanders under Li are from Li's hometown, and De Wang cannot arbitrarily transfer them. Therefore, Li also deeply wishes to lead his original four divisions into Rehe to preserve his strength. Currently, Chahar Province, North, has only the name of ten divisions. Except for the Seventh Division, which has not yet been established, and the Tenth Division of Mukedeng, which is actually newly formed, the actual strength of the eight divisions is no more than ten thousand men. If Li leads the four divisions east, then the strength will be reduced by half. Therefore, although there is talk of Li's troops moving east, it has not yet materialized. The reason for this is precisely this. However, the feelings between De Wang and Li Shou-hsin have recently become increasingly恶劣. On the 23rd of this month, Li suddenly ordered all the personnel of the eight major departments of the former First Army headquarters, currently stationed at Jiabutusi, to leave Jiabutusi and move to Zhangbei, seemingly showing a tendency to separate from De Wang. The situation of their discord is becoming more and more obvious. It is rumored that Li has sent troops into Rehe to build fortifications in the western part of Rehe. However, under the intimidation of a certain party, if there are no other intentions, their actions cannot be so free. It is probably unreliable.</p>
<p>Hu Bao-shan's Troops Continue to Mutiny</p>
<p>The puppet Mongolian Independent Brigade of Hu Bao-shan was stationed in Kangbao, west of Chahar. Because his troops were underperforming, a certain party intended to divide the soldiers of this unit into various divisions to supplement vacant positions. Later, because his troops learned of the news of the division, they rioted in succession. Hu also repeatedly asked a certain party to retain them. Therefore, they were not divided, and they were at peace with each other. On the evening of the 22nd of this month, Yang, a platoon leader in the unit, who was originally reduced from a company commander, was often dissatisfied. He immediately led dozens of his troops with firearms to mutiny together, taking advantage of the dim night to flee to the southeast. Also, on the 23rd of this month, a certain party used three hundred camels to transport one thousand two hundred boxes of gasoline from Dolon to Jiabutusi for storage in preparation for use.

<h3>The Full Text of the Judgment in the Assassination Attempt on Wang Jingwei and Song Ziwen (Continued)</h3>
<p>(B) Regarding Yu Wen Kui's Incitement of Troops</p>
<p>It is stipulated in Article 268 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that the facts of a crime should be determined based on evidence. In this case, the prosecutor's indictment states that "the defendant was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the National Armed Self-Defense Army by the Fujian People's Government in the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934], went to Hunan to incite the army, and returned after the failure of the People's Government." Upon examining the defendant's confession, aside from admitting that he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the National Armed Self-Defense Army by the Fujian People's Government in the 23rd year but did not take office, and that the National Government had explicitly ordered the cancellation of the wanted status of the key figures of the People's Government, which can be accepted without doubt, regarding the alleged incitement of troops in Hunan, after thoroughly examining the entire case file, the defendant never admitted to this. Even in his statement during the investigation, he claimed that he was ordered to conduct activities with troops in the Hunan and Hubei area, but did not go due to the failure of the People's Government. Therefore, the alleged incitement behavior was not even attempted, and it is difficult to consider that the implementation of the crime was established.</p>
<p>Although Hu Dahai stated at the Capital Police Department on August 29, 1936, that "I went to Zheng Yijian's house on the 21st day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar in the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., October 18, 1935], and saw Yu Likui return around the beginning of the tenth month of the lunar calendar [i.e., around October and November of the Gregorian calendar]. He only carried a suitcase when he returned. I heard that he came from Hunan and took out two yellow cloth bags from the suitcase, which were from the Nanyue pilgrimage. I then knew that he had recruited soldiers in Hunan," after questioning the defendant, he claimed, "At that time, I planned to go to Guizhou via Hunan, but due to the Guizhou military mutiny and traffic obstruction, I returned from Hengzhou." "I carried a suitcase because I went to Mount Heng to play and bought two cloth bags with black background and red characters for pilgrimage, and brought them back together." "The bags were lined, with blue cloth on the outside and a type of local cloth that was neither yellow nor white on the inside." "I did not recruit troops, and Hu Dahai did not see me recruiting. His words are purely idealistic and not credible." Furthermore, Hu Dahai stated before the prosecutor of the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court on September 19 of the same year, "Yu Likui came from Hunan, and I ideally thought that he was recruiting troops." It can be seen that Hu Dahai's confession was purely based on speculation and did not witness the defendant recruiting soldiers.</p>
<p>Considering Hu Dahai's statement during the court's interrogation, "Because he [referring to the defendant] is a military man, I ideally thought he went to Hunan to recruit soldiers. I don't know if this is the case." This further proves that the defendant did not incite troops in Hunan. Furthermore, after questioning Wang Renshan and other defendants, they also did not know if the defendant had done this. The defendant's argument that Hu Dahai's confession is not credible is not entirely unreasonable. The court should consider that the defendant's criminal suspicion regarding this part cannot be proven.</p>
<p>(II) Hu Dahai's Portion: According to the defendant Hu Dahai's defense, "I lived at 445 Hennessy Road, Hong Kong, around March or April of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935], for about two months. Later, I went to Guangzhou to seek employment but was unsuccessful. I returned to Hong Kong in September and found a job as a cook at Zheng Yijian's house, and immediately went to work there. One month later, Zheng Yijian ordered me to deliver a suitcase to the Li family. The suitcase was light and locked, and I didn't know what was inside. Not far away, I encountered a patrol officer in Happy Valley. He asked if there was opium in the suitcase. I said the suitcase belonged to the master. He wanted to open it to view, found a certificate inside, and immediately closed it. He wanted to take me to the police station. I asked what crime I had committed. He replied that it was a crime against the Chinese government, not a crime against the Hong Kong government, and took me and the suitcase away. In the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934] in July, I was home burying my wife and did not go out. I remarried in November and also stayed at home. I did not attend meetings with Wang Yaqiao and others in Wanzi Road, Babington Road, Guangming Terrace, Fengfu Terrace, Yongxing Street, and Chenghe Road." Upon reviewing the details of his confession, regarding the facts of burying his wife, remarrying, and going to Guangzhou, there is no sufficient evidence to prove it, and it is not credible.</p>
<p>As for his situation when arrested, according to Hong Kong Chinese detective Liu Ming's statement at the Magistrate's Court on February 6, 1936: "1. On the afternoon of November 22 last year, I was ordered to investigate the Yu Likui case. Around 4:30 PM that day, I patrolled to Leighton Hill Road near Wong Nai Chung Road and saw a person standing next to the bus stop, carrying a suitcase in his right hand and a package under his left arm. I immediately approached and said to him in Cantonese, 'I am a Hong Kong Chinese detective and want to search your package and suitcase.' He replied, 'I am going to send this to the Li family and cannot let you search it.' I asked him, 'Where did you come from?' He replied, 'Number 7,' and pointed to Yiu Wa Street. I then showed him my badge and searched his body. I found nothing. Then I searched the suitcase. Before searching the suitcase, I asked him what was inside. He replied, 'I don't know.' The suitcase was not locked, and I urged him to open it. He immediately opened it and said, 'Don't let people see it. This does not violate Hong Kong laws.' I saw many documents in the suitcase, including a silk fabric with Yu Likui's name written on it. This is the name of the person in the case I was investigating. I wanted to take him to the police station. He then claimed to be Hu Dahai, a name I had never heard before." Since the defendant knew that it did not violate the Hong Kong laws, it is sufficient to prove that he was fully aware of the contents of the suitcase and participated in the secret plot of Wang and Yu. Otherwise, how would he know that its contents did not violate the Hong Kong laws? Moreover, the defendant's claim that the suitcase was locked "and" the patrol officer asked him if there was opium in the suitcase is in extreme contradiction with Liu Ming's statement. His attempt to cover up and argue is even more undoubtedly. The court should consider that the defendant participated in the assassination.</p>
<p>(III) Zhou Shiping's Portion: Upon reviewing the defendant Zhou Shiping's defense, although he claimed that "I worked at the Wuhu Seamen's Union in the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933]. In July or August of the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934], the Seamen's Union was reorganized, and I left Wuhu for Hong Kong to seek employment with Yu Yanong. When I arrived in Hong Kong, Yu was away in Guangzhou due to business and I didn't get to meet him. I was ill in the hotel and was invited by Yu Likui to recuperate at his residence. I unexpectedly lived at Yu's house for over a year, but my illness did not improve. I remember when I first arrived at Yu's house, I lived at 10 Yongxing Street, then moved to 69 Chenghe Road, and finally moved to 7 Shastin Street. During this year, Wang Yaqiao did come, but because I was ill, I only saw Wang a few times through the door of the sun deck. The illness I suffered from was Hong Kong foot edema, with swelling all over my body, and I slept all day without going out. I did not attend meetings at Babington Road, Guangming Terrace, Fengfu Terrace, etc., and did not come to Nanjing to observe Sun Fengming and others." However, upon reviewing the fact that he lived at Yu Likui's house for over a year and met Wang Yaqiao several times, it is unlikely that he did not participate in the plan. Moreover, the defendant's alleged Hong Kong foot edema, allegedly had not yet recovered at the time of his arrest, but he did not report it to the doctor at the Hong Kong detention center. How is it that when he repeatedly appeared in court at the Central Magistrate's Court, he did not have any difficulty standing? This kind of obviously untrue defense is difficult to believe.</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that the defendant served at the Wuhu Seamen's Union in July of the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934], regardless of whether there is concrete evidence, since he repeatedly participated in the meeting and took on the task of observation, even if he did not participate once, it cannot preclude the establishment of the crime. It is true that the defendants held meetings repeatedly with the intention of generalization, and regardless of whether the target was Chiang or Wang, they were all in a continuous act. Therefore, anyone who participates in a part of this continuous act is still an accomplice in the act of murder. The defendant's behavior should be considered a crime.</p>
<p>(IV) Zhang Yuhua's Portion: Upon reviewing the defendant Zhang Yuhua's interrogation in this court, he has already admitted that "I am friends with Hua Kezhi. I met Wang Yaqiao once in Shanghai during the January 28th Incident, and met again in Hong Kong in the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935]. At that time, Sun Fengming and Guo Huizhong went together by ship from Shanghai, and stayed at the Hong Kong Hailuyong Hotel. I met Wang Yaqiao at the Qiongya Chamber of Commerce at night. Guo Huizhong was invited by me to assassinate in De'an. I knew about all three assassinations." The defendant, in addition to Lu Qingqi (i.e., He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Li Huaicheng, Xiang Zhonglin, etc.), also knew about all the others. In his confession written at the Nanjing Military Police Headquarters, he described in detail the reasons for organizing the Chenguang News Agency, the location of the weapons, and the encouragement and accompaniment of Sun Fengming. Now, he argues that both assassinations were proposed by Sun Fengming, who used the Chenguang News Agency to carry out the killings. It was not that the Chenguang News Agency wanted to assassinate central figures and used Sun Fengming. This is obviously an attempt to cover up and argue, and it is not credible.</p>
<p>Moreover, when the defendant went to De'an to invite Guo Huizhong, he explained to Guo that Sun Fengming's assassination of Chiang was unsuccessful and cost a lot of money. He planned to invite him to Nanjing to take on the task of assassinating Chiang. Guo Huizhong also testified that if the assassination was proposed solely by Sun Fengming, would Sun's actions be completed, and would there be any relationship with the defendant and the Chenguang News Agency? Why did he have to go to Jiangxi to invite people on his behalf? In addition, according to the defendant's own confession, he was not an employee of the Chenguang News Agency, but only knew Hua Kezhi and temporarily lived there. If this statement is true, Sun Fengming would not be able to use the defendant to use the Chenguang News Agency, and the defendant would not have known that he was using the News Agency and acted beyond his authority. This kind of unreasonable defense is even more difficult to believe. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Electricity Users Persist in Canceling Service</h3>
<p>The negotiations between the local electricity company and users have not been resolved. Since the 22nd [of the month], all users in the city have automatically canceled their electricity service. Shops and residents along Zhongshan Road have prepared kerosene lamps and are quite persistent. Mediation by party and government officials has been unsuccessful due to the company's lack of sincerity. On the 27th, the county government re-appointed Chen Xibin, the section chief of the Third Section, and Chen Guisan, the director of the Education Bureau, to convene representatives of the users for mediation. The user representatives immediately proposed reducing the electricity fee by half and improving the equipment. The mediators contacted the company, but the issue remained unresolved. On the 28th, the company requested Zhou Zhanqi to represent them and, at the County Chamber of Commerce, invited the original mediators, Section Chief Chen and Director Chen, and user representatives to continue the mediation. However, the company representative's attitude was tough, and no results were achieved. The user representatives, believing that the company had no sincerity in accepting government mediation, decided to hold another general meeting today to discuss active countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Raising Funds to Rebuild Lingxiao Pagoda</h3>
<p>Since the completion of the restoration of the Wenbi Peak and Yufeng Pavilion historical sites on Ma'an Mountain north of the county seat, the scenery has become even more elegant. The Lingxiao Pagoda on the mountain peak has been in disrepair for many years and is severely damaged. The current authorities have raised funds to dismantle and rebuild it. The original site will be widened, and steps will be added to allow tourists to climb and view the scenery. Work began last month and is expected to be completed in six months.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Bandit Leader of Xiaoliang Mountain Killed</h3>
<p>The bandit stronghold of Xiaoliang Mountain in the Jiwang Township of the Second District was previously raided by the military and police and burned by the public. The bandits fled in all directions and recently returned secretly. The bandit leader Xu Aliang was strangled to death for some reason and his body was abandoned on Xujia Bridge. After being discovered, it was reported to the Jiwang Police Station and forwarded to the county. County Magistrate Guo Mingxin, along with trial officer Shan Longbao, led forensic officers to inspect on the 27th and arrested a suspect, Xu Guo, for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Firecracker Explosion Injures Two</h3>
<p>Guo Yixing Firecracker Shop, located on Dongcang Street outside Xiaochemen in the county, is owned by Shao, who is a very successful businessman. Recently, he purchased a large amount of gunpowder and sulfur. Unexpectedly, a spark ignited the materials on the evening of the 17th, causing a sudden explosion. The housewife, Li, and her son, Lanbao, were both injured by the explosion. Their heads, foreheads, and backs were burnt. The fire quickly spread to the houses, but fortunately, they were built of galvanized iron, and only two rooms were destroyed, avoiding a major disaster.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Ten Thousand People Flood the Streets to See the Incense Festival</h3>
<p>On the fourteenth day of the third lunar month, the local residents enthusiastically held an incense festival. However, due to continuous rain, it was postponed to the nineteenth and sixteenth days. Unfortunately, it still rained on those two days, causing the incense festivals at Zhuji Temple, Sibao Bridge, and Shengxin Bridge to resemble "chickens drowned in soup." The festival-goers felt quite disappointed. On the afternoon of the 27th, incense festivals from Xuxiang and Dazhangxiang in Kaiyuan Township continued to arrive in the city and headed to the Huishan Shengdi Temple to offer incense. At 7 PM that night, the night incense festival from Huangnitou in Guangqin District also set off, and the crowd of onlookers was extremely crowded and lively. The streets were packed, and the shops closed early. The most spectacular parts of the procession included new gauze flags, gauze umbrellas, gauze-made imperial carriages, lanterns, children playing Liu Hai, Three Iron Roosters in the play, and young girls playing the Twelve Fairy Maidens holding stoves. It is said that on the 28th of the third lunar month, there will be a grand event of the Seven Temples paying homage to the Eastern Peak, which is currently being prepared and will be far more competitive and spectacular than the previous festivals.</p>

<h3>Liu Xiang Cables Urgent Plea on Sichuan Disaster</h3>
<p>Requests issuance of disaster relief bonds</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Sichuan Disaster Relief Association announced yesterday that it received a cable from Liu Xiang, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government. It read as follows: "To Minister Wu Dazhuan and Minister Jiang Yuyan: The Sichuan disaster is extremely severe, as Minister Wu has witnessed. Since Minister Wu left Chengdu, there has been no rain. Only a few counties reported light rain, which was very light and did not help the crops. Since last July, nineteen counties across Sichuan have suffered from drought. There was no harvest in the autumn and winter seasons. Most of the farmers in Sichuan are tenant farmers, who rely on the spring harvest. Now that the spring harvest is hopeless, life is even more difficult. The previous report that there were over 35 million disaster victims is accurate. According to recent reports from various counties, disaster victims are starving to death everywhere. In Chongqing alone, at least five or sixty people die every day. It is nearly summer, and if there is no rain in the next ten days, planting will be impossible. The future disaster situation will be even more unimaginable. I previously requested the issuance of 15 million in public bonds. Even if the full amount is approved, it will still be insufficient to distribute among the number of disaster victims. If the request is not approved, the situation will become even more desperate. I implore you to take charge and implement relief efforts to save the people. Liu Xiang." The Sichuan disaster is severe. Please unite to request implementation of relief efforts. The association sent a reply cable stating: "To Liu Xiang, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government in Chengdu: I have received your cable regarding the request for public bonds. Our representatives, Tang De'an, Xiang Yuren, Li Qingfan, and Lu Yifeng, have gone to Nanjing to join fellow Sichuan natives to jointly request that the Central Government approve the request.

<h3>Li Xing Steamboat Company’s Shanghai-Huzhou Line's Li Shun Steamboat Robbed</h3>
<p>The Greatness of the Loss is Unprecedented; Inland River Shipping Industry Cables for Arrest of Robbers</p>
<p>The Li Shun steamboat, belonging to the Li Xing Inland River Shipping Bureau which operates between Shanghai and Huzhou, was robbed at Yu Hui, the border area between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, at one o'clock in the morning on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<p>The loss of goods was over two thousand yuan. It is found that although robbery cases have occurred frequently on inland river steamboats in recent years, they have only involved searching and robbing passengers of money and jewelry. This robbery of large quantities of passenger goods is unprecedented. The Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Industry Association, upon receiving the report, telegraphed the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments yesterday morning, requesting them to order their subordinates to investigate and arrest the robbers. The original text is as follows: "To Chen, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Zhu, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, respectfully submitted: This is to report that according to a letter from member Li Dian Xin Ji Steamboat Bureau, their Li Shun steamboat, towing several passenger and cargo boats, was sailing from Huzhou to Shanghai on the 21st of this month. At one o'clock midnight, while passing through the Chang He Dang area, about twenty li from Yu Hui, it encountered two boats of bandits, one resembling a cabin boat and the other resembling a Shaoxing boat, carrying more than ten bandits. They fired shots to intimidate and ordered the boats to stop. They swarmed aboard and began to search and rob. After investigation, it was found that they robbed more than forty bolts of Huzhou silk, seven or eight hundred yuan in cash and jewelry from passengers, and three or four hundred yuan in clothing and jewelry from the crew. The total loss is estimated at over two thousand yuan.</p>
<p>It is found that the robbery of goods by bandits this time is unprecedented, which shows that they have organization and are not comparable to ordinary gangs. It is deeply regrettable that our inland river shipping has been subject to robbery for a long time. Therefore, we report to your association, requesting that the situation be reported to the political authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, ordering their subordinates to investigate and arrest the robbers in order to ensure safe navigation, etc. Accordingly, it is privately observed that Lun Hui is located at the junction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which has always been an area where bandits appear. At the beginning of spring plowing, they dare to openly rob, then, once winter defense is entered, the harm is even more unimaginable. Therefore, we telegraph to your Excellency, requesting that you order the water and land police teams in the area to solve the case within a time limit, and to consult on protection measures to protect travelers. Respectfully telegraphed, Zhou Baozhi, Chairman of the Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Industry Association, bows."</p>
<h3>The National Shipping Industry Encounters Unprecedented Difficulties</h3>
<p>Affected by the High Rise in World Commodity Prices, Freight Rates are to be Increased Only as a Last Resort</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: China's shipping industry, due to the slight recovery of the rural economy, has gradually developed its business, unlike the decline of the previous years. Unexpectedly, just as the general shipping merchants were feeling excited, they encountered unprecedented difficulties. Our reporter has made a special trip to the shipping industry to explore the various situations, as follows:</p>
<p>Unprecedented High Rise in the Cost of Ships</p>
<p>The reason is actually due to the high rise in world commodity prices. ❶ The world's shipbuilding has increased dramatically, and maritime construction has developed rapidly. The demand for steel has reached the point of exceeding supply. ❷ The cost of repairing and painting ships in docks has increased by nearly double compared to previous years. ❸ The rental of ships, for a four- or five-thousand-ton ship, which was rented at three yuan per ton in national currency last year, has now risen to nine yuan and five jiao, an increase of more than two times. The increase in other minor expenses is still impossible to calculate. Therefore, the expenditure of each ship has also increased accordingly.</p>
<p>It is Difficult to Maintain Without Increasing Freight Rates</p>
<p>Under such an extremely difficult situation, shipping companies feel it is quite difficult to maintain operations. The domestic river and sea routes, due to the abundant production of agricultural products in rural areas and the slight relaxation of the economy, the commodities shipped to the interior and the agricultural products exported from the interior are very frequent. All ships are often insufficient to load. Although it is planned to add new ships or rent ships to meet the needs of shipping, in the end, the income of the existing ships is not enough to cover the expenses, and it is even more difficult to purchase new ships. Therefore, it is generally believed that, as a last resort, it is planned to appropriately increase freight rates to supplement business operations, so that shipping companies can use their ships to seek the interests of the public.</p>
<p>International Routes Have Increased Freight Rates</p>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry, this difficult situation in the shipping industry is not only the case in China, but also international shipping companies are equally affected. Therefore, the cost of transportation on various ocean routes has already risen uniformly. For example, North American routes, from Japan to the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, between the Atlantic and the Far East, and various routes such as India, South America, London, Australia, and the Philippines, are all scheduled to increase freight rates from May 1.</p>
<h3>Banking Sector Invests in Hengzhong Textile Company Established</h3>
<p>Capital of 3.5 Million Yuan, Board of Directors and Supervisors Appointed; Factory Set Up in Changde, Western Hunan, to Start Production and Ship Goods Next Year</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: The Hunan Provincial Government, in order to develop the province's textile industry, has specially joined forces with local gentry and merchants and Shanghai banking circles to invest in the establishment of Hengzhong Textile Co., Ltd. After more than three months of preparation, everything is ready. The company's total capital is 3.5 million yuan, jointly operated by government and merchants, with government shares accounting for 20%, totaling 700,000 yuan, which is guaranteed by the Hunan Provincial Government. Merchant shares account for 80%, of which 350,000 yuan is guaranteed by Hunan gentry and merchants, and the remaining 2.45 million yuan is invested by banks such as the Bank of China. After several contacts by Yu Jichuan, Director of the Hunan Provincial Construction Department, and Peng Shinian, etc., all shares have been fully subscribed.</p>
<p>Establishment Meeting</p>
<p>The company held its establishment meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock at the Bank of China. Attendees included official shareholders' representatives Yu Jichuan, Director of the Hunan Construction Department, Yin Renxian, Director of the Finance Department (Yu as proxy), and merchant shareholders Bei Songsun, Huo Yamin, Wang Bingbo, Cheng Muhao, Liu Anong, Hu Jun'an, Wang Fuli, Peng Shinian, and more than 20 others. Bei Songsun was elected as the temporary chairman. After the rituals, the chairman reported first, followed by a speech by Yu Jichuan, and then a report by Peng Shinian on the preparations. Then, the articles of association of Hengzhong Textile Co., Ltd. were discussed and approved, and the official shareholders Yu Jichuan and Yin Renxian, and the merchant shareholders Bei Songsun, Wang Fuli, Peng Shinian, Hu Xiang, Hu Jun'an, Pan Jiufen, and Wu Yuexiang were elected as directors. (Official shareholder) Mao Yifeng and (merchant shareholders) Wu Qicheng and Cheng Muhao were elected as supervisors. Finally, it was decided that the factory site would be located in Changde, Western Hunan, the general office would be located in Shanghai, and a branch office would be located in Changsha. The meeting ended at about 5 o'clock.</p>
<p>Ship Goods Next Year</p>
<p>The entire plan of the Hengzhong Textile Factory has also been decided. All new-style machinery, including 30,000 spindles and 500 looms, has already been ordered from abroad, and it is expected to be shipped to China in the shortest possible time. The construction of the factory site in Changde will also begin. It is expected that production and shipment will begin next year. In the future, the products will be about 16-count coarse yarn, which can produce 90 pieces per day, and about 1,000 bolts of cloth, which is more than enough to meet the needs of Hunan Province.</p>

<h3>P&amp;O Company Prepares for the Centenary Celebration</h3>
<p>The First Company to Navigate Between China and England, Now Has 57 Mail Ships with a Total Capacity of 600,000 Tons</p>
<p>The P&amp;O Company in this port was conceived in 1837 and established in 1840. The initial capital was £6.5 million. Initially, the routes were only the British-Indian, British-Australian, and British-Philippine routes (South Africa). Later, it opened routes to the Far East, operating between London and Shanghai as its main route. At first, one mail ship a month came to Shanghai on the China-UK line. Later, due to the development of business between China and the UK, it was changed to once every two weeks. The China-India route of the British India Company was also managed by it. The company's branches and management offices are located all over the world, with a total of 210. Shipping is the largest in London and Shanghai. In recent years, all the mail ships operating on the China-UK line have been transformed into new-style express giant ships, including five R-class mail ships of 17,500 tons, five C-class mail ships of 16,200 tons, two N-class ships of 16,600 tons, and two M-class ships of 20,000 tons, and more than ten new-style cargo ships of 10,000 tons, stipulated to operate exclusively on the China-UK line. Three ships are dispatched every four weeks. Currently, the company has a total of 57 new mail ships and cargo ships, with a total net capacity of 589,000 tons. Shipping in China has been very developed since last year, and freight rates have increased, resulting in greater income. Currently, three ships arrive in Shanghai every 28 days, and three ships leave for the UK. The average income from export freight and passenger fares per ship is 150,000 to 160,000 yuan. The annual income from cargo and passengers is about 6 million yuan. In the Eurasian routes in the Far East, its business has been the leader among the shipping companies. The goods shipped this year are mainly Huzhou silk, Chinese tea, ore, soybeans, fur, raw materials, and tung oil. Recently, the Shanghai company received a telegram from the London office, stating that from its establishment to September 12 of this year, it will be one hundred years, and the mail ship service on the China-UK route has also been the first by the company's ships, which has also reached more than 80 years. In order to commemorate the establishment, it has been decided to hold grand celebrations for the centenary in London and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China. The company will print a special book on the history of shipping in China since its establishment, detailing the evolution of history. The Shanghai office has received a telegram and is already starting to handle it. The date of the celebration will be determined after the head office's telegram is confirmed, and relevant parties in Shanghai will be invited to attend the ceremony. The P&amp;O Company is the official Far East mail ship of the United Kingdom. The British government has a huge subsidy for the company. It is a Far East shipping company jointly operated by the state and commercial shareholders. Therefore, all the ships of the British India Company are also under its general management. In Shanghai, there is also a Bank of England, which is an auxiliary to shipping.</p>
<h3>Reflections on President Yu's Birthday</h3>
<p>Giving rather than Taking on Birthday Celebrations</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported yesterday that Supervisor Yu Youren's remarks regarding his birthday celebration contained many unacceptable ideas. The following are Supervisor Yu's official remarks as published by his office: Upon learning that various friends are planning to celebrate my wife and my birthdays, we have strongly discouraged them. However, I have two feelings about commemorating birthdays: First, to examine one's past achievements and shortcomings. The ancients' learning progressed with age; therefore, when we commemorate birthdays, we should make a general review of our past conduct and establish a new record for the future. Second, to repay society's kindness. We are born in this world, and whether it is education and culture or food, clothing, housing, and transportation, we receive the kindness of the country and society in everything, and we are indebted to the country and society at all times. Therefore, when commemorating birthdays, we should only give to society, not take from it. This time, colleagues in Shaanxi have proposed to build a library, which is a local effort to promote cultural undertakings. I will certainly donate as much as I can to repay the kindness I have received from society. However, the name of the library should commemorate the martyrs, and should not involve my name to increase my faults. All honor belongs to the dead is my lifelong principle. Also, my late aunt Mrs. Fang treated me with great kindness. During the Jingguo Army period, when my aunt was seventy years old, I planned to offer her wine and congratulations, but my aunt ordered me to stop, saying, "Shaanxi is so chaotic, with natural disasters and man-made disasters, there are no peaceful days. Why celebrate my birthday alone?" I have always remembered this and dare not forget it. Therefore, I donated more than a hundred kinds of rare books that I had accumulated over many years to the Xijing Library to commemorate my aunt. Last year, President Chiang's birthday was simply to lead the people of the country to pay attention to national defense, which I admire and hope that the people of the country will understand.</p>
<h3>Yu Jichuan Talks About</h3>
<p>Construction in Hunan Province</p>
<p>Yu Jichuan, Director of the Hunan Provincial Department of Construction, came to Shanghai from the province to attend the establishment meetings of the China Tea Company and the Hengzhong Textile Company. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited him at his hotel yesterday and asked about the construction situation in the province. According to him, ❶ All construction depends on convenient transportation, so the first construction project in Hunan Province is the highway, and it is being carried out with all efforts. The county roads that have been completed now have one thousand kilometers, and the provincial roads that connect with neighboring provinces have reached four thousand kilometers. ❷ Changsha is the center of the province's politics and economy, and the number of residents is increasing day by day. In order to solve the people's drinking water problem, they are planning to build a self-operated tap water plant. ❸ Hunan rice has increased a lot in recent years. There was a bumper harvest last year, but unfortunately there is no perfect regulation plan, so it has not been able to be transported out of the province. This year, there is a rice shortage in Guangdong Province, and it has not been transported there either, so it still relies on imported foreign rice. It is very regrettable to say so. They are currently trying to promote sales. Some counties in Hunan Province can harvest twice a year. The early rice will be harvested in June, and the late rice has already been sown and will be harvested in September. The authorities are trying to improve rice varieties. ❹ Hunan Province is rich in mineral resources, and the Construction Department is now sending experts to explore and drill, and then招商開採 [solicit merchants to develop]. ❺ The special product exhibition of the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangdong has been moved to Changsha and is scheduled to open on the 8th of next month. Yu also said that in addition to attending the meeting, he will also contact the banking community for investment and plans to转京返省 [return to Nanjing and then return to the province] within days.</p>
<h3>Whereabouts of Current Figures</h3>
<p>Tan Zhen: Wu Tiecheng, the newly appointed chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, is scheduled to be sworn in on the first of next month.

It is expected that he will stay in Guangdong for a while and then return north.</p>
<p>Wang Luyi: Wang Luyi, Secretary-General of the Supervisory Yuan, left Nanjing by night train the night before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at around 7:00 yesterday morning.</p>

<h3>Condolences to Cao Ketong from Customs Personnel</h3>
<p>Glorious Bleeding</p>

<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Ordered the Silk Weaving Industry Yesterday to Obey the Order</h3>
<p>Resume Work in the Factory by a Specified Date</p>
<p>The silk weaving industry labor dispute in this city, which was caused by the management's refusal to comply with the decision made by the Social Affairs Bureau and filed an appeal, has caused a second strike. Now the municipal government has decided to maintain the original punishment by the Social Affairs Bureau. The Social Affairs Bureau recently received a copy of the municipal government's decision and ordered the Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association to quickly comply with the municipal government's decision and implement the decision to resolve the dispute. The bureau also considered that May is approaching and that the labor dispute should not be allowed to drag on any further.

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Approved the Change of Color of Fishing Salt</h3>
<p>Trial Operation for One Year</p>
<p>Submit for Approval After the Trial Period Expires</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, upon receiving the submission from Daishan Court requesting to change the color of fishing salt by mixing it with red soil and submitting a sample of imperial salt for review and instructions, should approve the trial operation for one year and designate the Liangzhe Salt Affairs Administration to comply. The document reads, "Submission No. 290 on March 4, 26th year, from Daishan Court requesting to change the color of fishing salt by mixing it with red soil and submitting a sample of salt for review and instructions is acknowledged. Both the submission and the salt sample have been received. According to Chen Daishan Court's fishing salt, it is planned to change the color using red soil, using four qian of red soil for every hundred jin of salt. Since this is for the sake of convenience, it should be approved for a trial operation of one year. The benefits and drawbacks should be observed at all times, and a report should be submitted for approval after the trial period expires. As for the request to notify all courts in the area to implement it uniformly, it has been investigated that the fishing salt in each court in the area was approved to use rice bran as the color-changing raw material in April of last year by the transport envoy, and the order was issued to the transport envoy to notify each court to comply with Salt Character No. 3985. It was also ordered to conduct a thorough investigation of whether the fishing salt made with rice bran is easy to distinguish and convenient for inspection, and whether the pickled fish is suitable for the market, and to report for review. It is unclear whether the previous method of using rice bran has been implemented by each court and whether it is suitable. Please clarify and respond for review. This order is given by Minister Kong Xiangxi."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Announces the Income Tax Calculation Method</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday, saying: "Dear sirs, this association previously informed that various companies, factories, and stores have a method of deducting salary for</p>
<p>Partners and Employees</p>
<p>Who are late or leave early, so when withholding income tax, it should be calculated based on the actual monthly payment. However, item 12 of the draft of the collection guidelines for the second category of income tax states that "the tax should be calculated based on the actual amount of income, according to the original amount of expenditure," which is inconvenient for calculation and does not conform to the provisions of Article 11 of the implementing rules. Based on the letters from the Instrument 交具業 [Instrument Supplying Industry] and 彩印業 [Color Printing Industry] trade associations, the association forwarded them to the Ministry of Finance for modification. The association subsequently received approval from the Ministry of Finance, number 12637, which stated, "Received the submission. Article 11 of the implementing rules stipulates that "for the second category of income, if the number of months is less than one month, the tax should be calculated based on the actual amount of income," which refers to the standard for calculating the tax. The specific calculation method is not clearly specified, so there is a supplementary provision in item 11 of the draft collection guidelines for the second category of income. The two do not conflict. The monthly changes in the salaries of workers in various factories mentioned in the submission are different from the situation stipulated in Article 11 of the travel rules. Although the salaries have a fixed monthly amount, those who take leave are deducted salary on a monthly basis, those who work overtime are paid extra on a daily basis, those who arrive late are deducted salary on an hourly basis, and those who work overtime are paid extra on an hourly basis. Therefore, the monthly income is calculated on a daily basis, and the daily income is calculated on an hourly basis. Although the salaries have a fixed monthly amount, they are actually calculated on a daily and hourly basis. Therefore, this income should be calculated and taxed based on the actual amount of income in each month, which is not difficult in calculation. The association is hereby notified of the above-mentioned situation, which is approved by the Ministry of Finance. It is hoped that all industries will follow this as a basis and notify their respective industries to act accordingly. Furthermore, the association sent a letter to the Shipping Industry Association, saying: 'In reply, on the 17th of this month, we received a public letter from the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, number 1133, which stated that the Ministry of Finance approved the letter from the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, number 358, to submit a comparison table of the age and tonnage of ships over 100 tons nationwide, and requested an explanation of the</p>
<p>Depreciation</p>
<p>Rate for ships over 20 years old, whether the standard should be determined based on the number of ships over 20 years old, etc. It is found that the useful life specified in the first calculation table of depreciation rate in the asset valuation method attached to the collection guidelines for the first category of business income tax refers to the shortest useful life. If the service life of a ship has exceeded 20 years, it can calculate the depreciation rate according to the actual useful life and based on the provisions of item 9 of the valuation method and item 8 of the explanation of the depreciation rate calculation table, which is approved by the Ministry of Finance. Correspondingly, this letter is replied for your reference and notification." Given this, it is now replied for your reference, and it is hoped that you will act accordingly."</p>

<h3>Mr. Hidaka, the New Japanese Consul-General in Nanjing, Made a Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Daily News, Mr. Hidaka Shinrokuro, the newly appointed Councillor of the Embassy and Consul-General in Nanjing, came to Shanghai on the 28th and will leave Shanghai for Nanjing the day after tomorrow. Yesterday (28th) afternoon, he made a statement to Japanese reporters at the Consulate-General, as follows: "I served as Consul in Nanjing three years ago, and now it has been exactly four years. This time I come to China, and there are many people I know in both China and Japan, so it is convenient for me to handle affairs. The relationship between China and Japan is hoped for and advocated by both Japan and China. However, I will act as a bridge between the two countries to promote mutual understanding. There is no new policy in diplomacy. I will only strive to move forward in reality in order to smoothly resolve the cases in the county. For example, the navigation duty and other issues are not only beneficial to Japan, but also have great benefits for China. I will fully explain the points that are beneficial to China so that the cases in the county can be resolved."</p>

<h3>The Unsolved Case of the Suspected Assassin of Zhao Tieqiao Was Adjudicated Yesterday</h3>
<p>Officials such as Zhou Zhizhang stated that the case should not be prolonged; Wang Jinshan and others claimed not to know the three defendants.</p>
<p>Zhao Tieqiao, the Director-General of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was assassinated outside the company's gate at 9:00 a.m. on July 24th of the 19th year of the Republic of China. Afterwards, Liu Junqing, a Chinese detective of the Lao Zha Public Concession Police Department, and Li Shugui, a detective sergeant, arrested four individuals: Wang Shuqiao, a lawyer from Anhui (brother of Wang Yaqiao, leader of an assassination group), Zhou Zhizhang (also known as Xuan Si), Hong Yaodou, and Niu Anru. Subsequently, because the Shanghai Municipal Police Department needed to investigate Wang and others in another case, they requested to transfer them. Niu Anru then escaped from the custody of the Municipal Police Department. Now that the Police Department has completed its investigation of Wang and others, they have been sent back to the First Special District Court. The details of one interrogation have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiequn continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. Wang Yaotang, the police department's lawyer, stated that during the adjournment period, the police department brought Wang Jinshan and Xia Shaoen (who were also convicted in the Zhao case and sentenced to life imprisonment) from the Shanghai District Court to confront Wang and the others. However, both Xia and Wang claimed that they did not know the three defendants in this case. This was an expected fact, as convicted criminals would not want to testify against unconvicted criminals. However, Zhou Zhizhang, one of the defendants in this case, and Xia Shaoen were found by the police department to have committed a robbery at the Great Britain Bank in the 18th year of the Republic of China, which is still under investigation. Therefore, he requested that the case be postponed. Judge Xiao stated that the case concerning the assassination of Zhao has been delayed for too long and should not be prolonged. If there are other cases to be added, they can be filed separately. He then ordered the trial to proceed and questioned Zhou Zhizhang, Wang Shuqiao, and Hong Yaodou. Zhou Zhizhang, who had made a clear confession at the police department, now completely denied it. Wang and Hong also unanimously denied it. The court then brought Wang Jinshan and Xia Shaoen to the court for cross-examination. Unexpectedly, both Wang and Xia claimed that they did not know the three defendants in the case, and Zhou Zhizhang and the others also claimed that they did not know Xia and the others. The court, believing that the facts were clear, ordered the commencement of arguments.

<h3>Liu Zhengkui's Wife Remarries While He Was in Detoxification</h3>
<p>Guo Shunyu did not know she had a husband; Liu Xu did not want to follow a poor man.</p>
<p>Liu Zhengkui, a 41-year-old man from Zhenjiang currently residing at 709 Zhaoma Road, Ximen, works as a tailor. Previously, Liu lived at 560 Fangbang Road. Because he was deeply addicted to opium and unable to quit, he entered a detoxification center this year in the first lunar month, separating himself from his family. His wife, Liu Xu, had no food at home and believed that Liu Zhengkui was desperate and had committed suicide. She publicly announced that her husband had committed suicide by drowning in the Huangpu River. She then asked her husband's aunt, Liu Cai, to act as a matchmaker and remarried Guo Shunyu, a man from Hubei, as his wife. They lived together at Jianqiao, Nanshi, and took Liu Zhengkui's one-year-old daughter with them. Recently, Liu quit his addiction and was released. He went home but found that his wife and daughter were gone, and the rented house was occupied by another family. Liu became destitute and immediately began searching everywhere, gradually learning about his wife's secret. He reported it to the police, who arrested Liu Xu, Guo Shunyu, and Liu Cai and brought them to the District Court, accusing them of bigamy. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu Lide opened the court. Liu Xu testified that because her husband was addicted to opium and in a detoxification center, she had no food and voluntarily remarried. Guo Shunyu testified that in January of this year, Liu Cai and others acted as matchmakers and married Liu Xu to him. He was told that her husband had passed away and she was destitute, so he married her. He thanked the matchmaker Liu Cai with ten yuan. Liu Cai testified that Liu Zhengkui was her nephew and everyone knew that Liu Zhengkui was addicted to opium and could not make a living, so he jumped into the Huangpu River and died. That's why she acted as the matchmaker. The matchmaking money was given to a matchmaker surnamed Hu, and she did not receive a single cent. Liu Zhengkui testified that he entered the detoxification center on January 26th and was released on February 13th. He went to his former residence at 560 Fangbang Road, only to find that the household items, his three-year-old daughter, and his wife were all gone. He later found out that his aunt, Liu Cai, and others acted as matchmakers and remarried her to someone else. At this point, the judge asked Guo Shunyu if he still wanted Liu Xu as his wife. He replied that he did not know she had a husband. Now that she has a husband, he is willing to let her reunite with him and return the child to him, but he wants to be compensated for the loss of marrying a wife. The judge ordered Guo to bring the child to the court and return her to Liu Zhengkui. Unexpectedly, Liu Xu said that she would rather die than remarry a poor man because she would starve to death again in the future. The judge concluded the trial and will announce the verdict tomorrow. Guo Shunyu was ordered to return home, while Liu Xu and Liu Cai were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Rejects the Slum Dwellers' Proposal</h3>
<p>Result of Yesterday's Board Meeting</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng Society reported that the slum dwellers in the Hudong district are extremely panicked because the Public Works Department will demolish 500 shacks in May, according to the resolution of the previous Board of Directors. They have been petitioning the Public Works Department for days and proposed four relief measures, requesting the revocation of the demolition order, which has attracted much attention from all sectors. The Public Works Department also discussed this case at yesterday's board meeting. As a result of the meeting, the previous board's resolution was maintained, deciding to demolish 500 shacks first, while the four measures proposed by the slum dwellers were not adopted. After learning of this news, the slum dwellers became even more panicked and anxious, and there is a tendency to refuse demolition, which is worthy of attention in the future.</p>
<h3>Three Abducted Girls Found on the Japanese Ship Tangshan Maru</h3>
<p>Discovered by Investigators from the Women and Children's Relief Association; Xu Wang and others Saved from Disaster</p>
<p>Chen Shaoting, an investigator from the China Women and Children's Relief Association, accompanied by Na Qingyun, a detective from the Customs Water Patrol Police Department, inspected the Japanese ship Tangshan Maru of the Nissin Company's Beiyang Line at the Laobaidu Wharf in Pudong at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. They encountered a middle-aged woman, a young woman, and a young girl standing together in the third-class section, with no male passengers, which looked very suspicious. They immediately stepped forward to inquire, but their words were inconsistent and full of loopholes. They were taken to the police station. According to the middle-aged woman, Xu Wang, 33 years old, from Yi, used to run a matchmaking shop in the city but it is now closed. Last night, an acquaintance, Xu Laoer, brought the young girl, Li Jindi, and told her to recommend them to work in other ports, ordering Jindi to call her "stepmother" on the ship, unknowingly being deceived. According to Li Jindi, 14 years old, from Changzhou, residing at 31 Shijiantou, Qichang Zhan, Pudong, she only knew she was going out to work and did not suspect being abducted. Another young woman, Xu Shi, 22 years old, from Pudong, said that she was brought onto the ship yesterday by her lover, Mr. Wang, who said they were going out to do business together. She did not realize she was being abducted until the ship was about to set sail. The detective believed that the testimonies of the three women showed that they were being lured and taken to North China for sale by abductors. Xu Wang was also suspected of being an accomplice in the abduction. He ordered a continued search for the escaped abductors and further investigation.</p>

<h3>Dispute Between British and French Tram Workers</h3>
<p>French Tram Ticket Inspectors; British Tram Ticket Sellers</p>
<p>The Dagong Society reported that at 9:40 a.m. on the 27th, a No. 2 tram of the British Tram Company in the Public Concession, traveling from Jing'an Temple Road to Shiliupu, had a ticket seller of the No. 579 British Tram Company violently beaten by a No. 12 ticket inspector of the French Tram Company. The injured ticket seller reported to the tram's chief superintendent, Brock, requesting a serious negotiation with the French Tram Company to ensure their safety. Otherwise, due to lack of protection, the British tram troops would not enter the French Concession. According to the injured worker of No. 579, the cause of the incident was that last month, the No. 12 ticket inspector, wearing plain clothes, boarded a Public Concession tram. When he tried to sell a ticket to him, he refused to buy one, leading to a conflict. Yesterday morning, while serving on the No. 2 tram and traveling to Shiliupu, the ticket inspector dragged him off the tram and beat him violently without asking why, causing him to suffer serious injuries all over his body. He has reported to the company and requested protection.</p>

<h3>Police Investigate the Organizers of the City God's Marriage</h3>
<p>The Weiling Gong City God, enshrined in the Dongjing Temple in Dongxiangkou, Yangjing Town, Pudong, was recently said to be marrying the spirit of Chen Qiutao's deceased daughter, Yue'e, who owned a butcher shop in the town's west market. This was initiated by local female shamans and others. Ignorant men and women echoed the idea and sculpted an idol and placed it in the temple two years ago, effectively living together. Recently, they had the audacity to declare that the City God wanted to get married again, with the consent of the female household. The wedding was held on the 25th of this month, with rituals similar to those of living people. This strange and bizarre drama has been reported in newspapers, arousing much criticism in society. Zhang Mingqin, the Pudong Police Branch Chief, believed that the matter involved superstition and that it was contrary to the trend of the times to hold a so-called City God marriage in this era of scientific advancement. Yesterday, he ordered Cai, the police chief of the Yangjing Police Station, to identify the organizers and punish them appropriately as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Pengpu Defense Corps Rescues Abducted Girl and Arrests Two Abductors</h3>
<p>Girl Rescued from Hotel; Thugs Impersonate Detectives</p>
<p>Feng Sanmao, a 27-year-old man from Wuxi who runs a rag shop at No. 9 Ku'anli, near Sanguan Temple on Liyuan Road, Nanshi, married a woman surnamed Gu from Benniu in his hometown on the 11th of this month (lunar calendar). After the marriage, he brought Gu to No. 28 Liyuan Road, Shanghai, to live together on the 16th. Yesterday morning, Gu went out to buy a washboard and brush for laundry at around 10:00 a.m. She suddenly got lost and encountered two thugs, both wearing gray uniforms. The thugs pretended to live next door to Gu and offered to escort her home. Gu was young and inexperienced and had never been to Shanghai before, so she believed them. She followed the two thugs and hired three rickshaws, which took her directly to the Shangbao Hotel on the west side of Datong Road, Zhongyu Road, Zhabei, and opened room number four on the upper floor. At that time, Gu was wearing a gold-plated silver ring, which the thugs suspected was made of gold. They forced her to take it off and pawn it. Gu also thought that the ring was made of gold, so she cried in the room after the thugs went out. The hotel went to inquire and learned that the young girl had encountered abductors. They secretly reported it to the second team of the Pengpu Defense Corps. When the two abductors returned to the hotel, they were arrested. After being interrogated, one thug was identified as Wang Hui, 31 years old, and the other as Xu De, 34 years old, both from Anhui. They claimed to be detectives from the Zhejiang Water Police Bureau investigating bandits in Shanghai. A gold-plated ring, the young girl's property, was found. The team then sent personnel to Nanshi to inform the young girl's husband, Feng Sanmao, who confirmed that she had gone out to buy things, got lost, and did not know how to return home, leading to her falling into the hands of the abductors. After obtaining the confession, the team believed that the thugs not only attempted to abduct the young girl but also impersonated detectives and privately wore gray uniforms. Therefore, in the evening, they escorted the young girl and the thugs to the Xinzha Branch Bureau and transferred them to the Shanghai District Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Zhu Zaijun, a 19-year-old local man and junior proprietor of the Xinyingji Construction Company at 385 Beijing Road, and Zhang Xiuying, an 18-year-old girl, were initially close friends. Over time, they became fond of each other and made a pact to stay together forever. On Christmas Eve last winter, Zhu and Zhang went to the New World Hotel for drinks. After Zhang became drunk, Zhu let her stay overnight. It was said that after he broke the girl's virginity, he broke his promise, causing the girl to feel ashamed and angry. She then hired lawyer Shi Jiutang and filed a criminal lawsuit against Zhu in the First Special District Court for seduction, requesting punishment according to Article 225 of the Criminal Law, and attached a civil lawsuit, requesting that Zhu pay her a lifetime living expense of 30 yuan per month until the age of 60, totaling 14,040 yuan, and another 1,000 yuan in compensation for mental damage. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing opened the court to summon and examine the accused Zhu Zaijun, but he did not appear. The complainant, Zhang Xiuying, testified about the experience of losing her virginity, saying that the defendant had written a letter stating that he would marry her, so she complied with his request and stayed overnight with him. Now, she earnestly wishes the defendant to marry her. Judge Zhong stated that since the plaintiff is requesting the defendant to fulfill the marriage contract, it is a civil matter and does not involve criminal charges. Therefore, he immediately declared the defendant Zhu Zaijun not guilty.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Native Place Association Receives Reply from Zheng County Government</h3>
<p>Actual Graves Are Not To Be Removed</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association previously stated that the provincial government was urging the removal of all exposed coffins and dilapidated tombs within 100 meters of the highway in the Ningbo area. Overseas compatriots were alarmed by the news. The association submitted opinions and sent letters to the governments of various counties in Ningbo, stating that the actual burials that have been buried for a long time should be handled after the completion of the public cemetery to avoid losses to the people. After sending the letters, the association received a reply from the Zheng County government yesterday (excerpt above). The current announcement from the county government is to move the exposed coffins within 100 meters of the highway. All dilapidated tombs are not included in this relocation. Public cemeteries should be established in each township and town, and they are now urging the implementation. It is expected that they will be completed in the shortest possible time. The demolition and relocation of all dilapidated tombs and graves that have been buried for many years should be implemented after a separate plan is formulated and finalized. Therefore, actual graves within the area along the highway in Ningbo do not need to be removed before a solution has been determined.</p>

<h3>Divorce of Wang Gongxing and Zhou Jingwan Resolved</h3>
<p>Divorce Agreement Deemed Valid; Husband Pays 4,500 Yuan</p>
<p>Wang Gongxing, the Chinese Vice Consul in Chicago, USA, took leave to return to China two years ago. Through a friend's introduction in Shanghai, he married Zhou Jingwan, a woman from Ningbo. After the marriage, they went to the United States together, and their relationship was quite harmonious. Unexpectedly, in July of last year, the couple suddenly disagreed for some reason and divorced in the United States. Wang Gongxing gave Zhou $320 in U.S. dollars for her return trip to China and promised to pay her a monthly allowance of 100 yuan in national currency for one year. After Zhou arrived in Shanghai, she suddenly denied the divorce agreement made in the United States. The two parties sued each other in the Second District Court, and Judge Li Liang summoned them several times. The case was waiting for further evidence and another hearing. During the adjournment, the two parties reached an agreement. Wang Gongxing would pay Zhou an additional 4,500 yuan in national currency as a friendly allowance. Their 2-year-old son, Wang Jingfan, would be raised by Wang Gongxing. On the 27th (the day before yesterday), the date for another hearing arrived. Wu Kaisheng, the male representative, and Chen Yunzuan, the female representative, also accompanied Ms. Zhou Jingwan to the court on time.

All of the 4,500 yuan in national currency for the allowance was received by Zhou in full, and Zhou Jingwan confirmed that the divorce agreement made in the United States was entirely valid. Neither party shall interfere with each other's marriage or remarriage in the future.</p>
<h3>Extortion Case Cracked Through Phone Call Tracing</h3>
<p>Tang Guonian Frequently Receives Letters and Calls; Yu Lianwen and Wang Huairong Ordered the Crime; Rickshaw Driver Was the Mastermind</p>
<p>Tang Guonian, the owner of Ruichangyu Hardware Store at 41 Dengtu Road, received a threatening letter from thugs by mail on January 26 of this year, stating that they planned to open a military academy and needed 50,000 yuan for expenses. Two blank sheets of paper were included, instructing him to write whether he agreed or disagreed and post them at the entrance of Lane 401 of the store. Tang ignored it. On the 30th, another letter arrived, stating that since no indication was seen in the previous letter, the money was needed temporarily and would be repaid after the school was established. Tang still ignored it. On the 7th of this month, another letter arrived, stating that they had sent five letters. If he did not indicate his agreement, a large number of soldiers would come to his home to question him. He was asked to send someone to contact them at the corner of Qimei Road and Huangxing Road in the city center the next morning between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m., with the person holding Shen Bao newspaper as the secret sign. If he missed the appointment again, his life would be in danger. It was signed by Zhang Kun, the deputy captain of the Central Soviet Red Army. Tang sent a representative to wait, but no one came to negotiate. On the 22nd at 7:00 p.m., Tang's son, Fuyun, received a phone call from a female voice asking if the letter had been received and if the money had been sent. She also wanted to write a letter. The next afternoon at 4:00 p.m., he received another letter, asking him to send someone to the original location in the city center between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. on the 24th, holding a roll of magenta paper as the sign. He sent someone to wait at the specified location with the red paper as instructed, but there was still no movement. He dared not come to contact them. On the morning of the 26th, he received another letter stating that the matter must be resolved as soon as possible, otherwise they would take drastic measures. At 8:30 a.m. the day before, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Hanshan Police Department saw Yu Lianwen, a Nanjing man, at the Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant at 405 Pingliang Road, making a phone call to Tang to inquire about the payment, and arrested him. They subsequently arrested his accomplice, Wang Huairong, a man from Tongzhou, near the restaurant. The two suspects were searched at No. 381 Congshi Road and No. 66 Kaige Road, and English and Chinese phone books were found. They were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police department's lawyer, described the events and stated that the mastermind was Zhang Asi, Cai Wenhua, and Lu Xiaofa. Zhang used to work as a rickshaw driver for the victim, Tang Guonian, and was the inside man. Zhang Asi asked Cai Wenhua to draft the threatening letters, and the defendant Yu Lianwen admitted to writing two letters. The rest were written by others. The defendant Wang Huairong used to work at the Shanghai Telephone Company. He requested a postponement of the case because there were other letters demanding money and extorting property. Tang's son, Fuyun, and He Shanqing, the cashier of Zhuangyuanlou, testified about the events. Judge Pu questioned them, and the defendants' testimonies were evasive. Judge Pu ordered them to remain in custody for another seven days for further investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Economic Straits Lead to Bizarre Idea: Introducing Wife as Concubine</h3>
<p>Followed by Staged Adultery for Extortion; Chuan Bingsheng Dissatisfied, Sues in Court for Investigation</p>
<p>Chuan Bingsheng, a Ningbo native residing at No. 40, Shengji Lane, Xuxia Road, Southern Head, Dadongmen, Nanshi, engaged in the silk business on Paomalu (Race Course Road), is currently 49 years old. Due to his childlessness, he often expressed to friends his desire to take a concubine in hopes of having offspring. Pan Aqun, a Taizhou native residing at No. 36, Fulin Lane, Route Lafayette, French Concession, engaged in the stone business, is 33 years old and a friend of Chuan. Recently, due to financial difficulties, and knowing Chuan's desire for a concubine, he came up with a bizarre idea. Several days ago, he introduced his own wife, Wang Caidi (19 years old, from the same hometown as Pan), to Chuan. Chuan and Wang went to room 414 of the Old Oriental Hotel, where they became intimate and fell in love. On the afternoon of the 21st of this month, at 1 p.m., Chuan again arranged to meet Wang at room 11 of the Shenjiang Hotel in the Mackiee Avenue (麥家圈), but Pan Aqun, believing the time was right, gathered his friends Ying Deming (from the same hometown as Pan, residing at No. 6, Kangji Lane, intersection of Malong Road and Route Conty) and Ying Xiaodi and his father, and rushed to room 12 of the Shenjiang Hotel. They staged an "adultery" arrest to extort money. After "catching" them, they hired a Xiang Sheng taxi and took Chuan to Ying Deming's house, where he was imprisoned upstairs for a day and a night. Pan demanded 200 yuan from Chuan in exchange for selling his wife, Wang Caidi, to him as a concubine. After Ying's mediation, Pan agreed to 180 yuan, and Chuan would take Wang as a concubine. Pan wrote a letter of divorce, which was temporarily held by Ying. Chuan, lacking funds, wrote two promissory notes, promising to pay 50 yuan each on the 23rd and 25th. The promissory notes were also temporarily held by Ying, to be cleared upon payment. The following afternoon, Chuan was released and regained his freedom. Chuan, feeling aggrieved by Pan's attempt to set him up and extort money, reported the case to the French Concession police. After investigation by detective Guo Shaorong, Pan Aqun, Wang Caidi, and Ying Xiaodi were arrested the day before yesterday, while Ying Deming fled upon hearing the news. The arrested individuals were taken to the police station for detention and yesterday were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. Presiding Judge Liao interrogated them, and the Legal Affairs Office attorney Yuan Shouxi explained the case and requested an extension for investigation and prosecution. The plaintiff, Chuan Bingsheng, through his attorney, recounted the events and stated that the defendants had attempted to reconcile with the plaintiff and returned the promissory notes, and he did not wish to pursue the matter, requesting leniency. When questioned, Pan Aqun claimed that Chuan had seduced his wife into adultery, and upon discovering this, he went to catch them, and Chuan willingly paid for his losses and wrote the promissory notes. Wang Caidi claimed she was seduced by Chuan, and Ying Xiaodi denied assisting in the extortion. The court reviewed the testimonies and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody, with a further hearing scheduled for May 8th.</p>

<p>Zeng Sunshi, wife of Zeng Baoshan, who runs an ice factory in Zhangjiabang, Pudong, was young. On March 8th of this year, Zeng Baoshan went to Puxi on business, leaving only his wife at home. His colleague Yuan Xiangqing, a native of Chongming, had long harbored improper thoughts. Finding only the mistress of the house at home, he thought it was a good opportunity to satisfy his desires. That night, while she was in a good dream, Yuan broke into the bedroom and forcibly raped her. When she realized what had happened, she was ashamed and inconsolable. The next day, her husband saw her still crying but did not comfort her. Angered, she went out, feeling that she had been raped and not understood by her husband.

After the court searched the law firm, they found a letter written by Sun Yucheng, who lived at No. 10, Tiande Lane, Haichaosi Road, to Wang Bingquan about his wife's younger sister, Ding Aying, getting divorced. Wang Bingquan and Sun Yucheng were also arrested. The local court sentenced Yang Yushan to one year and six months of imprisonment, and Wang Bingquan and Sun Yucheng to eight months of imprisonment each. Upon appeal to the High Court, the Third Criminal Division found that Sun Yucheng had publicly mediated for relatives and was not guilty, so Sun Yucheng's part was acquitted. Yang Yushan's original sentence was upheld, and the appeal was rejected.</p>
<h3>Inmate Sues French Police for Assault, Court Rules Inadmissible</h3>
<p>Due to the Exterritoriality of the French Police</p>
<p>Zhang Bingrong, a Ningbo native nicknamed "Little Ningbo," a suspect in the assassination of gambling king Shao Wenbin, i.e., groom A Liu, was arrested by the French police and sentenced to life imprisonment by the court, serving his sentence in the Second Prison directly under the Ministry of Justice. Last autumn, the French police arrested Wang Shilong, the principal offender in the assassination case, and brought Zhang to confront him. After the principal offender was sentenced, Zhang Bingrong filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court, accusing French police officer No. 12, surnamed Xi (name unknown), of assault and injury, requesting an investigation. Judge Sun Xihuan held a hearing and interrogated Zhang, who testified that when Wang Shilong was arrested and he was brought to the police station for questioning, detective No. 12, Xi, without cause or reason, illegally assaulted and beat him, causing him to suffer injuries and cough up blood, as confirmed by a forensic doctor. He requested that the defendant be summoned for questioning. The court ordered further investigation and verification. The above information was previously reported. Now that Zhang has recovered from his illness, the court held that detective No. 12, Xi, is a French national and enjoys extraterritoriality, so the Chinese court cannot accept the case. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun in the Fifth Court ordered the case of inmate Zhang Bingrong to be brought up for questioning. After explaining the case, he ruled that it was not admissible in court. Zhang was sent back to prison to continue serving his sentence.</p>
<h3>Female Salesperson Xu Yueming Illegally Collecting Customer Payments</h3>
<p>Counter-sues Chen Chengrong for Owed Commission</p>
<p>Chen Chengrong (41 years old, from Yongjia), owner of the Datong Longitudinal Weaving Factory at No. 1, Shunrong Lane, Baotong Road, Zhabei, previously sued female salesperson Xu Yueming (35 years old, local resident, residing at No. 98, Route Paul Henry) in the local court, accusing her of falsely using the name of the boss's wife to illegally collect hundreds of yuan in customer payments. After a collective hearing by the local court, Xu Yueming was ordered to pay a 300 yuan surety. Xu Yueming also filed a counterclaim in the local court against Chen Chengrong for fraud and embezzlement, stating that she was a salesperson with a contract to receive commissions. In the past year, she had sold over 20,000 yuan worth of goods for him and should have received several hundred yuan in commissions, but had only received 150 yuan. He claimed that she had embezzled, so she requested an investigation. Yesterday, Judge Fu questioned the defendant, who stated that he did indeed owe her 110 yuan in commissions, but he had already notified her to come and collect it, but she did not come and instead illegally collected customer payments, etc. The court debate was concluded, and sentencing will be at the end of the month.</p>

<h3>Remedial Class for Examining Physicians Scheduled to Open</h3>

It is heard that the Physicians Association of this city has already decided to prepare to open classes based on the National Physicians Federation's letter, and because the number of physicians in this city who need to be examined but have not obtained certificates from the Ministry is relatively high, to meet the requests of the physicians, they have decided to open classes.

<h3>Silk Merchant Jin Hongyuan's Home Robbery Case: Three Defendants Admit Unreservedly</h3>
<p>Chauffeur's Substitute Nephew Initiated the Crime; Case Solved Within Forty-Eight Hours; Yu Haigen, Zhang Amao, Shen A-yu; Recovered Stolen Goods and Gold-Colored Copper Coins</p>
<p>Silk merchant Jin Hongyuan's house is located at 144 Alabaster Road. On the afternoon of the 25th of this month, around 8 PM, six robbers suddenly arrived, pretending to ask for directions to</p>
<p>Trick Open the Door</p>
<p>Forcibly enter, placed the homeowners and others under surveillance, used weapons to threaten them into silence, and then began to search and loot for about half an hour. They stole legal tender and jewelry worth approximately 1,179 silver dollars. They left and fled. Jin Hongyuan immediately reported to the Foreign Concession Police, stating that the stolen legal tender was intended for purchasing goods and had just been withdrawn from the bank. All the bills were in denominations of five and ten yuan from the Central Bank, and had</p>
<p>A "Hongyuan"</p>
<p>Stamp on them. Furthermore, one of the robbers seemed to be the nephew of his chauffeur's substitute, etc. Consequently, Chinese Detective Shang Wu, Detective Wang Youshan, Shen Jinwen, etc., conducted an investigation and obtained clues. Therefore, within forty-eight hours of the incident, they solved the case, arresting the robbers Yu Haigen from Tongzhou, Zhang Amao, and Shen He-yu from Wuxi. The reason being that Jin's family employed a chauffeur named Wang A-er, who recently took leave and asked Yu Yougui to be his substitute. Yu's nephew, Yu Haigen, learned that Jin was quite wealthy and</p>
<p>Gathered Accomplices</p>
<p>Zhang Amao, Shen A-xing, and others, a total of six people, first discussed the robbery plan at Room 101 of the Asia Hotel on Rue Edouard, and used two fake pistols made of black wax to carry out the robbery. After obtaining the money, they returned to the Asia Hotel to divide the spoils. Fearing exposure, they then</p>
<p>Abandoned the Wax Guns</p>
<p>On the rooftop, and moved overnight to Room 239 of the Yingbin Hotel in Qinghefang, Zhejiang Road. Unexpectedly, the detectives found out about this. On the afternoon of the previous day, they first arrested Yu Haitao and Zhang Amao at Changkang Lane on Alabaster Road, and then went to the Yingbin Hotel and apprehended Shen A-yu. Two fake pistols were seized, and over a hundred yuan of Central Bank legal tender were found on each person, most of the bills having the "Hongyuan" stamp, as well as two gold-colored copper coins. It was said that these copper coins were obtained by the robbers in advance at the City God Temple, seeking divine guidance,</p>
<p>As Tokens</p>
<p>So that if they were arrested after the crime, they would not reveal the names of their accomplices. They were all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted them under Article 330 of the Criminal Law for robbery, and presented the above circumstances, requesting a postponement to apprehend the accomplices. In addition, the victim, Jin Fei-shi,</p>
<p>Testified to Being Robbed</p>
<p>Described the circumstances and pointed out that Fa Gao Yu Haigen was present at the time. When questioned, all the defendants admitted unreservedly to the robbery. Zhang and Shen, the two defendants, each received 66 yuan. It was Tian, an accomplice who was at large, who recruited them. The presiding judge ordered the three defendants to be detained pending a seven-day investigation and verification.</p>

<h3>Arm Yourselves!</h3>
<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>"In order to protect national sovereignty, to protect the financial lifeline and the tax revenue of the national industrial and commercial economy, we can only give a head-on blow to this shameless smuggling. We are willing to sacrifice, we are willing to go to the front line of anti-smuggling to fight to the death, but we cannot fight empty-handed like this. We hope the government will arm us!"</p>
<p>If we are not forgetful, we should remember the declaration issued by customs officers last time, which "received enthusiastic sympathy and assistance from all sectors of the country." But unfortunately, after this declaration was issued, some senior foreign officials in the "Customs" came forward to prevent further investigation and, in addition to “investigating the initiative,” “there was also surveillance when anti-smuggling personnel met at the club to discuss countermeasures. At the same time, regarding anti-smuggling issues, they must obey the instructions of superiors and must not execute them without the instructions of superiors, resulting in various disputes," and stipulated the so-called "proper arrest measures." - This "measure" did indeed "send the seized copper coins to customs for confiscation" on the Shanghai Maru, which Mr. Kodama took back to his country. Besides that, (I don't want to waste space copying news anymore, and I can't copy it all anyway.) It's probably all about the "bloody facts" of an iron ruler and a wooden stick flying together!</p>
<p>But our respectable and lovable "soldiers on the front line of economic national defense" know that "the road in front of us is very clear, there is only one, that is, a difficult and rugged road that requires our struggle and sacrifice." Therefore, even in "the increasingly strong attitude of the Japanese and Korean vagrants," "when carrying out anti-smuggling missions," "facing this thorny road, facing the enemy's iron rulers, wooden sticks and short spears, without trembling, without retreating," "I always feel that behind me there are eyes of eager expectation and heartfelt love from compatriots all over the country, so I am even more cautious and dare not fail the expectations of my compatriots," "embracing great enthusiasm and perseverance to complete this important mission!"</p>
<p>"But, compatriots, in addition to warming our hearts, we cannot use your enthusiasm and assistance to resist the shameless and vicious vagrants' iron rulers and bayonets! We need your enthusiasm and assistance, and we need arms even more. How urgently we need arms! Yes! Unless we are willing to give up "national sovereignty," unless we are willing to give up "the financial lifeline and the tax revenue of the national economy," the facts are in front of us. On this thorny road, it is either "struggle and sacrifice" or "tolerance and retreat." But the lesson of "economic cooperation" is enough to wake us up from the dream of "loving peace"; "hoping" that friendly countries "respect our sovereignty and integrity and treat us on the principle of equality and mutual benefit" can only be achieved through "struggle and sacrifice," using poison to attack poison, and only stopping the valley after using valley, the so-called "using one's own blood to wash the hands of others," which everyone can understand.</p>
<p>We hope that the government will arm us, "so that we can more bravely engage in close combat with despicable and shameless smuggling vagrants. We believe that we will not be disappointed."</p>
<p>Yes! We believe we will not be disappointed!</p>
<h3>Calling for Peace for the Shantytowns</h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>The reason why shantytowns are being considered a problem is probably only after the bloody disputes caused by the Shanghai Municipal Council's order to demolish the thatched huts last year. Therefore, everyone has narrowed this issue down to "the property rights of shantytowns and the infringement of the freedom of residence." In fact, if we understand that the term "shantytown" is fundamentally unreasonable, we should have sought a solution to this problem before the bloody disputes occurred. Unfortunately, our senses are so slow, and it is only when they suffer greater infringements that we notice that there is such an unreasonable and infringed group of people in this civilized society. However, even if it is late, if there is a thorough solution, it is still in time. Unfortunately, most of our people are busy listening to the excitement. Although there is a so-called shantytown problem, it has been delayed again and again, one time after another, one day after another, and it is still unresolved and even more serious. So, even if we know that this is indeed not a small problem, what can it do to change the facts?</p>
<p>The decision of the Shanghai Municipal Council to demolish the shantytowns is said to be "a plan resolved by the Shanghai Municipal Council's board of directors," so "it is difficult to withdraw the order." Moreover, the deadline is approaching, "Starting from May 3, the 500 thatched houses in the area west of Lan Road and Yinxiang Road will be demolished according to the original plan. Then, the thatched houses in the area east of Lan Road and Chaoyang Road will be demolished after a two-month deadline." In this way, it really seems that it must be demolished, which is what is called a "tough attitude."</p>
<p>Of course, there are reasons for demolishing the shantytowns, but in the process of demolishing the shantytowns, because of the deadlock between the two sides, there will inevitably be so-called "unfortunate incidents." Now, the deadline for demolishing the shantytowns is only a few days away. Can we sit idly by and watch the arrival of a bloody tragedy? So-called "civilization" is probably not unreasonable. If we want to be reasonable, we will naturally not let the problem fall into a deadlock. Let us call for peace for the shantytowns.</p>
<p>On the 26th, more than 700 shantytown residents in Pudong petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council. The petition was roughly like this: "Your Council once discussed building public housing to replace the thatched huts. Now, the agreed decision has been cancelled for no reason, and the demolition is resolutely carried out. How can the people be willing? Your Council is a law-governed organization and cannot issue orders to destroy orders, putting the shantytown residents in a dead end, and is unwilling to consider the livelihood of the common people, focusing only on the interests of the wealthy, demolishing the so-called thatched huts, disregarding the difficulties of the people, and causing unnecessary disputes. Social unrest, affecting industry and commerce, and disrupting order are not intentionally caused by the shantytown residents, but are intentionally created by Your Council, and the unpredictable dangers should be fully borne by Your Council." Originally, demolishing the shantytowns for the sake of "rectifying the city appearance" or seeking hygiene and cleanliness is understandable, but if it is "exclusively for the sake of the wealthy," then it cannot be sympathized with. I hope this news is not true. At the same time, the remedial measures for the housing problem of the shantytown residents after the previous demolitions, such as discussing the construction of public housing, are reasonable, but "the agreed decision has been cancelled for no reason," and I don't know what the reason is.</p>
<p>At the same time, the most puzzling thing is that "the shantytown residents and others, because the Shanghai Municipal Council still refuses to withdraw the order, the five representatives proposed that the more than 4,000 shantytowns should pay 5 jiao per household per month, 6 yuan per year, and deposit it with the Shanghai Municipal Council or other organizations. After ten years, the Shanghai Municipal Council will use the funds collected by the shantytowns to build public villages," this method was also not adopted and was only allowed to be "considered." This really makes the shantytown residents have no "step" to "give way." Does it really have to make his family wander on the streets? It's no wonder that the shantytown residents' final expression is: "If the Shanghai Municipal Council does not give a satisfactory reply, they will unanimously swear to death that they will not allow the thatched huts to be demolished." Peace, in the end, is naturally self-defense.</p>
<p>Now, there are only a few days left until the "end." We hope: First, the Shanghai Municipal Council will give a "satisfactory reply." Otherwise, second, I hope that those who come forward after the fact will solve the problem earlier, otherwise we really can't bear to see the "unforeseeable dangers."</p>
<h3>On the Watershed</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>— Miscellanea of Mountain Travels</p>
<p>Dragged by a depressed mood, walking on the mud-like road after the rain.</p>
<p>Looking up, there is still a long way to go! We added a new pair of broken straw sandals, supported ourselves with a peach wood stick, and crossed the watershed.</p>
<p>"Watershed" - I'm not sure which water it divides. As for the ridge, I'm really ashamed to say that I can't look down on the peaks, but on the contrary, I'm looked down on by the peaks. However, it has a natural dividing line, winding from this pass and extending to both ends, cutting through the subdued blue sky and dividing the continuous mountain peaks into individual groups.</p>
<p>Once you reach the watershed, the situation is a bit different. On the mountain road, along the mountain walls and the edges of the fields, lush green trees and unknown flowers and plants tightly cover the path, as quiet as the lane in a park. Looking at the mountains full of delicate green, we stopped. Out of habit, we knew it was time for lunch.</p>
<p>The village was simply pitifully small. Of course, there wasn't much to say about the vegetables. Having a bowl of salt-boiled tofu curd was already considered "a very good thing." But a major problem arose with the rice. The rice in storage was limited, and it was difficult to cope with fifty or sixty mouths. Later, the neighbors in the village gathered together to make it through this important difficulty.</p>
<p>One • Insult</p>
<p>Eating lunch inevitably involved a relatively long stay. For the porters, this stay became a special opportunity. In groups of three or two, they walked into the opium dens where "one woman serves a western master, and a western queen sees gold spears and shields." In their habits, eating black rice was more important than eating white rice. What about us who were unwilling to follow suit? Of course, we were also unwilling to sit bored in a small village that didn't even have a name. Those with similar temperaments gathered together and dispersed, one group going east and one group going west.</p>
<p>Old Tie and I took a roundabout route along the unfamiliar path behind the village. Outside a fence on the west side of the village, there were quite a few people gathered. From a distance, we could hear a wave of scolding, the sound waves quite high, seemingly expressing some unspeakable resentment. At the same time, another tune, still with a childish flavor, rose up, sternly arguing. Curiosity urged us on, and we hurried over. Who would have thought that the person surrounded in the center was none other than Little Sun, who was not yet twenty!</p>
<p>What was it for? A child who had not yet seen the world, and who was in a wild and unfamiliar mountain environment, seemed unlikely to have offended others? But now, you can't idealize. He was surrounded and receiving merciless scolding. Judging from the situation, it seemed that because of his arguments, people thought they were superfluous, and they might even want to try the taste of "old fists." Finally, Little Sun revealed the main reason for this incident: it was because he wanted to defecate in the pit in this fence. When he went in, he didn't expect that a young woman was "taking care of things," so he ran out in panic. Who would have known that this run would become an unforgivable root of disaster!</p>
<p>——Here, the boundaries between men and women are seen as extremely faint. Unless you insult a woman's body in action, you will be punished. The so-called punishment depends on the severity of the circumstances. Usually, there is no need to separate places for urination and defecation. Everyone has a body left by parents who are pure and clean, so why be so mysterious? This was said by an old man. He glanced around: So, when you encounter a woman relieving herself, it doesn't matter. You just go your own way as usual. Otherwise, it means that you think this woman's body is not pure and clean, in other words, it has an unlimited element of insult! According to customary practices, this insult must be punished. He was, after all, an old man, and understood etiquette, so his tone was much more gentle.</p>
<p>Following that, we explained the hardship of travelers who could not foresee all the customs, and begged him to mediate and persuade. Following that, A Huang and his group came, and many porters also came. Probably because there were many people and the momentum was strong, our arrogance increased, while they softened. Originally, we were prepared to "punish" once, but now it was all scattered and cleared.</p>
<p>Returning to the village, we couldn't help but laugh. In a remote little village, there was such a wonderful performance!</p>
