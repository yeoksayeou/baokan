<p>時評</p>
<h3>撤銷領事裁判權問題</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>三中全會所議定之“撤銷領事裁判權應繼續與各國交涉”一案。國府已令外交部切實辦理。而上海律師界近又主張呈請政府。自動撤銷。以求我國法權的完整。這種建議。在不良外僑藉領事裁判權為護符。橫行不法。妨害我國行使領土主權的今日。尤其值得我們的重視。</p>
<p>列強在我國取得領事裁判權。所根據的並非國際公法的原理。而是不平等條約的規定。歐戰以後。我國以這種制度的存在。足以妨害我國法權的完整。曾在巴黎和會中要求撤銷。但未獲得各國的允諾。一九二一年美國召開華盛頓會議。討論遠東問題。我國出席代表重又提出這個要求。仍無效果。國民政府成立後。和各國修訂商約。雖有少數國家撤銷其領事裁判權。但至今在我國享有領事裁判權的。還有英美法日意瑞典挪威葡萄牙丹麥荷蘭秘魯比利時巴西墨西哥等國。</p>
<p>領事裁判制度的本身缺點很多。第一是適用法律的參差。領事裁判的管轄。依據被告的國籍而定。但各國法律不盡相同。同一行為。在甲領署認為有罪。在乙領署可認為無罪。因此往往有案情相同。而罪刑大異者。第二是領署對於異國的證人原告沒有管轄權。案中所需證人。倘其國籍和被告不同。則領署不能強制他出庭作證。就是他自願作證而所言不實。領署也不能科以偽證罪。其對於原告亦如此。倘使被告對於原告提起反訴。領署因為沒有管轄異國原告之權。就無從審理。第三是外國人在中國內地犯罪。搜集證據不易。外國人旅行內地。如有犯罪情事。按照條約。應“就近送交領事官懲辦。沿途祇可拘禁。不可凌虐。”這種規定。無異說旅行中國內地的外國人。雖犯妨害風化。故意殺人等罪。亦須解送到遠在千里外的通商口岸領署懲辦。在交通不便的地方。解送千里。需時甚久。到審訊時搜集體據。自更不易。第四是領事官和裁判官的職務互相衝突。領事官的職務是在保護本國僑民的利益。今以他國人民訴其本國人民的案件。交其審理。和保護的職務既不相容。而欲望其裁判公允。毫無偏袒。事所難能。單就上述四個缺點看來。領事裁判制度顯然是早就應當撤銷的了。</p>
<p>而且還有我們無可容忍的一點。領事裁判權的存在。是對於我國主權的重大的侵害。這足使不良外僑。用作護身符。在我國境內。擾亂治安。肆行無忌。甚或誘致漢奸。改入他國國籍。作奸犯科。我國法院亦無法懲處。如近來各地。走私販毒的猖獗。及特務機關的林立。推究禍根。都在領事裁判權。因此。在統一建設復興民族這當前兩大目標之下。我們必須以全力為政府後盾。促成領事裁判權的撤銷。</p>
<h3>意國外長齊亞諾行抵南斯拉夫京城</h3>
<p>政治協定旦夕可成　雙方尊重領土完整　小協約國頗為重視</p>
<p>⊙南斯拉夫京城　意國外交部長齋亞諾伯爵、頃於午前九時三十分偕同南斯拉夫駐意公使杜契區、意國駐南國公使恩台利、到達此間、南國國務總理兼外交部長斯多瓦的諾維區、當率同軍政界各要人、（陸軍部長莫利區將軍亦在其列）在車站迎候、車站暨附近街道、均懸掛意南兩國國旗、沿途民衆𪊒集、歡呼致敬、齊亞諾下車後、即與斯多瓦的諾維區握手為禮、當由步兵第十八團軍樂隊、奏意南兩國國歌、齊亞諾乃行法西斯式敬禮答謝、旋即登汽車離站、定於本日午前、覲見攝政保祿親玉、并於當晚前往台特尼宮赴宴、（中央祉二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>⊙南斯拉夫京城　意國外長齊亞諾伯爵到達此間之後、負責人士頃宣稱、雙方所當成立之政治經濟協定、可於本日午後或明日簽字、政治部份當包括雙方各項懸案解决辦法、並附以宣言書一件、聲明尊重領土完整、其內客與意大利希臘、暨意大利土耳其前所訂立之友好條約相同、此間主管方面頃宣稱、南國對意態度、並不因而有所變更，僅以恢復原來立場為事、意國態度雖與前此不同、南國接受之餘、對於本國一般政策、匪特不欲加以變更、即現行各種國際義務、亦無意削弱之云、（中央社二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］齊亞諾伯爵訪問南斯拉夫京城之主要目的、為訂立政治條約、而非商務條約、此訊似已證實、據消息靈通之“意大利日報”載稱、意南兩國之政治協定、必能增進兩國之友好關係、又稱、此項政治協定之內容、尚未公布、然比較數年前所訂意南友好條約、必更為重要云、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］此間外交界人士對於外長此行、極端重視、以為意南兩國相互接近、其目的端在拆散小協商團體、緣南國所惴惴不安者、不外兩項主要危機、一即各隣邦、尤其是匈牙利與意大利兩國、關於領土問題所提出之要求、一即奧國哈布斯堡　舊皇室復辟、關於第一層、意國當局現正鼓勵匈國、向捷克國提出領土要求、而對於南國則否、至意國與南國接近之後、其對於達爾瑪蒂省所提出之要求、雖未必提出切實保證、亦當放棄染指之念、關於第二層、意國最近亦已表示反對、因此、南國所持反對態度、已可獲得意國之贊助、益以捷克與羅馬尼亞兩國之贊助、自更有力矣云、（中央社二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>⊙羅馬尼亞京城　意外長齊亞諾伯爵訪問南斯拉夫京城、小協商各國頗為憂慮、此間南斯拉夫公使加西杜拉滋、為消除此種憂慮、已訪問羅馬尼亞外長恩多奈斯哥、據稱、渠已保證南斯拉夫在未與小協商各國商議前、决不採取任何行動、渠又聲明、截至月前為止、南斯拉夫尚未與意國訂立協定、今日羅馬尼亞報紙載稱、南斯拉夫似欲於小協商會議之前、與意國成立密切之聯合、此間以為南斯拉夫公使之非正式聲明、即為答覆此項報告云、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>⊙羅馬尼亞京城　意國外交部長齊亞諾伯爵定於明日前往南斯拉夫國京城一行、此間政界人士聞訊之餘、極為驚異、緣南國政府近曾通知羅馬尼亞政府、謂與意國所進行之談話、未必在短時期之內宣告結束故也、一般人以為、齊亞諾此行、係由意國方面所發動、其目的乃在用盡一切方法、務與南國成立諒解、一方面可認為意國外交上之勝利、一方面更可以擾亂小協商各國人心、此在羅國官場人士、則因南國業已提出保證、謂意南兩國所可成立之協定、純以英意兩國關於地中海之協定為藍木、絕不危及小協商集團之堅固性、因而對於齊亞諾伯爵此行、仍持以鎮靜云、（中央社二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］意國外交部長齊亞諾伯爵作　南斯拉夫之行、此舉出於突兀、頗令此間觀察者為之驚訝、咸以為意國與南斯拉夫之談判、目下忽有進展、此當與意國對西班牙事件態度硬化後所造成之歐洲緊張局勢、互有關聯、蓋意國倘决定繼續干涉西班牙內亂、則在中歐方面、自不得不取緩和態度、而與南斯拉夫互相接近也、然小協約各國常設政治會議、將於下月初在捷克京城開會、南斯拉夫政府是否願於小協約會議之前、即與意國訂結協定、殊成疑問、一般人預料、意國與南斯拉夫之協定、倘經訂立、則其內容大約係規定由意國購買南斯拉夫所出產之原料品、而以南斯拉夫承認意國兼併阿比西尼亞作為交換條件云、（中央社二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>日內即可成立</p>
<p>［羅馬］據消息靈通人士推測、日本與意大利兩國經濟協定、即將舉行簽字、其期或在本月杪之前、亦未可知、此項協定、其主要條文、係規定日本現在意國所享受之貿易權利、得推及於意大利帝國各屬地、因之日本乃得鞏固其在阿比西尼亞之貿易地位、消息靈通人士又謂、意大利原在日本長崎橫濱神戶等地享有永久租賃土地之權利、日本欲使意國放棄此項權利、關於此層、現正由日意兩國間進行討論、除此以外日意兩國間似未必簽訂何種政治協定云、（中央社二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日衆院討論保障人權</h3>

<p>［東京］衆院今晨十一時十二分開會、提出律士法中改正法案及其他六件法案、池田清秋說明理由後、附託委員會、其次小泉又二郎及四十五議員連名提出“建設議會圖書館及議員事務所”之决議案、而由內崎作三郎說明內容、要求政府實行、又力說建設新聞通信社記者俱樂之必要、繼由政友會星島二郎登壇發言、謂政府如不計此經費、則可謂政府口稱立憲政治、而實際輕視立憲政治、議長乃問衆意見、此時全體議員起立、表示贊成、於是本件可决、</p>
<p>其次小泉又次郎及五十五議員連名提出“關於根絕人權蹂躪”之决議案、此時社會大衆黨河上大太郎提議小會派　之人權蹂躪决議案、亦合併討論、然被過半數否决、</p>
<p>於是民政黨代表說明政友民政昭和會三黨共同提出之决議案現由、言及警察官蹂躪人權之實例、攻擊官僚獨善主義、設明既畢、其次開始討論、第二授室加藤勘十最先發言謂、</p>
<p>欲根絕人權蹂躪、確立憲法所保證政治的理由為根本之問題、民政黨代議士對於新聞記者之暴力行為、豈非人權蹂躪乎、加藤乃宣讀當時新聞記事、此時政友民政兩派議員故意妨害、然加藤不理、繼續其言謂、</p>
<p>查提出本案之動機、極為不純、因此本人在形式上不得不反對、然關於根絕人權蹂躪之宗旨、本人自當贊成、唯提出本案之諸議員、不顧大衆的人權蹂躪問題、而僅為自己所關係之事件提出决議、殊非安當、本案應撤回、一度加以修正、作有權威之决議案、</p>
<p>加藤下壇後、政友會大石倫冶登壇謂、</p>
<p>當局檢舉共產黨或暴力團時、確有拷打等事、然此兩者均為國民所反對者、故多數國民未曾作為問題、然對於選舉違反事件、有此人權蹂躪、殊不妥當、</p>
<p>討論完畢後、議長詢問贊成或否、此時社會大衆黨等第二控室議員全部退出議場、本案遂以通半數之贊成成立、時定下午二時、議長宣告休息、</p>
<p>下午三時四十二分再開會議、富田議長最先奉讀延長議會期之詔書、其次提出國民保險健康法案、委員長報告後、開始討論、東方會田中養達登壇謂、</p>
<p>今日藥價過貴、係製藥公司圖暴利之故、政府為何不取締製藥公司而統一藥價、</p>
<p>田中對於委員長之報告、表示反對、而主張維持原案、此時社會大衆黨員罵聲騷然、其次民政黨武知勇記登壇、表示贊成意見、然社會大衆黨三宅正一反對謂、</p>
<p>本案經委員會修改、殊為遺憾、其責任應由政府負之、政府當初言明為死守原案、不辭解散議會、然後屈服醫師會之策動而至此</p>
<p>三宅抨評修正案、又暴露民政黨審議本案時之醜態、同時言及民政黨代議士打傷新聞記者事件、此時民政黨員怒號不已、旋由民政黨松永東提議停止討論、小會派高呼“反對反對”然經各員投票之結果、贊成者一百七十三票、反對者四十票、停止討論之動議成立、其次舉行國民保險健康法案之採决、結果以一百七十八票對二十八票之多數、委員長報告之修正案成立、其他保健所法案反預防結核法中改正决案，亦以大多數可决，六時三十四分散會、（二十五日同盟電）</p>

<h3>埠際足球天津上海相逢逸園</h3>
<p>今日下午三時起賽　實力彷彿勝負難測</p>
<p>第六屆滬津埠際足球賽、滬津兩隊、定今日下午三時在亞爾培路逸園交鋒、津隊實力、甚為平均、前鋒尤為銳利、如霍威約翰遜及瓊士、滬人俱知之甚稔、無待介紹、中衛台維斯倍雷、俱曾代表上海、赴津出席埠際賽、張學堯·譚福禎·姜璐·孫永泉等、俱曾在滬表演、故津隊實力、類皆耳熟能詳、滬隊乘方戰勝香港餘威、在老將軋許指導、亦必能出奇致勝也、按滬津已賽五次、津勝三、滬勝一、尚有一次和局、雙方陣綫如下、</p>
<h3>津滬埠際足球賽簡史</h3>
<p>今年起改為每年一次</p>
<p>考證埠際足球之過去歷史、每由上海香港兩隊比賽、一九二八年天津西聯足球會始亦派隊來滬比賽、構通上海天津之足球風、</p>
<p>▲第一屆</p>
<p>—一九二八—</p>
<p>一九二八年十二月二十五日在膠州路申國球場舉行、斯時上海隊華人入選者有周賢言之守門、馮運佑之右內衛、李惠堂之左內鋒、戴麟經之中鋒、實力殊為強悍、不料天津不嗚則已、一鳴驚人孫思敬為華人唯一之入選者、予滬上球迷之好說、毛立生之中鋒、堅如頑石、禿頂羅保、史林傑、派克（節現在法商之派克）傑漢生之前鋒、鋒芒無比、初戰顧一比一和局、一月二十九日再在申園决戰、上海先負兩球、後即連勝三球、天津再中成三比三、上海馬山兒隻身陷陣、又佔勝勢、以為可操勝券、不意天津史林傑於三分鐘後即造成平手、在最後三分鐘天津威爾遜再建奇功、乃以五比四克上海、</p>
<p>▲第二屆</p>
<p>—一九三○—</p>
<p>一九三○年上海天津香港三隊、同時會戰上海、此為三角循環賽嚆矢、於二月一日起在申園及逸園兩場舉行、上海首戰香港、以五比二大勝、再戰天津、又以三比二勝、上海仍得第一次錦標、最後一場香港亦以三比二勝天津、</p>
<p>▲第三屆</p>
<p>—一九三三年—</p>
<p>一九三一年又值輪空、不意一九三二年一二八滬戰勃發、上海遭逢空前暴擊、各項運動、盡皆停頓、滬隊遂亦無暇北上踐約、遂商定第三屆於一九三三年在天津補行、上海赴天津比賽、上海以一比七大敗、大受華足球界之誹謗良以上海西人足球會以為天津容易對付、故對於人選濫竽充數、致遭此敗、</p>
<p>▲第四屆</p>
<p>—一九三四—</p>
<p>一九三四年春、津港滬三隊二次會飾上海、津隊實力甚強、豈知出人意外、上海與之成三三和局、不再重賽、港隊則二比六先敗於滬、二比四再敗於津、其失敗之慘、開空前之紀錄、</p>
<p>▲第五屆</p>
<p>—一九三六—</p>
<p>去年（一九三六年）在津舉行、滬隊敗得非常可惜、上半時滬以二比一佔先、繼又以四比二佔優勢、不料為津隊連中六球、致以四比八失敗、兩隊於去年埠際宴上、决定廢棄兩年一次之陳例、而改為一年一度、故今年在上海繼續舉行第六屆焉、而比賽制度、亦因去年造成、和局時幾於無例可援、遂於今年加以規定、為“如比賽成和局時、則於次日重賽九十分鐘、如重賽中再成和局、則延長十分鐘各一次、（即以十分鐘換邊）如於延長時間再無高下、則終以和局為定局”、此項新制、業於前日由西人足球會頒佈、此後將永定為例、</p>

<h3>各方反對工部局增捐</h3>

<p>職員開槍幸未傷人　昨晨六時、日旺工人循例進廠上工、當被普陀路捕房所派之探捕阻止進內、並謂、廠中擬將機器掉換、暫時宣告停工、此時全體工人、乃擁至賬房間交涉　要求即刻開工、富有人事科主任王能華·織部工程師傅瀚聲·紡部工程師何達·織部科員兪蔭椿·等四人各出自衛手槍、計開放兩槍、幸未傷人</p>
<p>沸水澆射重傷三人　工人因廠方開槍威嚇羣情憤激、益以人多聲雜　廠方見無法驅散、即以沸水向各工人澆射、當時有朱阿三·朱阿大·姚永鶴·等三人、頭面手足等部受重傷燙起水泡、受輕傷者二十餘人、各工人乃一擁上前、奪得王龍華之手槍、當時捕房聞訊、特派預備隊警備車前往彈壓、始將工人驅散、</p>

<p>當局今晨召集調解　市黨部社會局根據工人請願報告以事態嚴重、故社會局已定今晨九時、在該局召集雙方負責代表進行調解、對於開槍事亦定今日派員澈查、市黨部除將手槍彈壳送交警備司令部研究外、决派員澈究眞相、以便進行解决、</p>
<p>勞資雙方均有表示　據廠方表示、工人均執有鐵尺木棍、搗毀器物、割斷電話綫、毆打職員、幸機房鎖閉、得未波及、總計損失富在一萬元以上、惟據工人聲稱、工人等要求開工、純為合法請求廠方不述理由、開除工人、拒絕上工、工人等為生活計、作合理之要求、乃遭開槍、澆射沸水、工人為自衛計少數者與其互毆、此次糾紛、應由廠方負責云云、</p>
<p>一廠怠工勸告即止　西蘇州路三十七號新裕第一廠共有工人一千餘名因不滿廠方無故開除二廠工人、並開槍澆沸水傷及工人身體為援助起見、故於昨晚八時夜班工人宣告怠工響應、當時戈登路捕房聞訊、即派大批探捕前往彈壓、並進行勸告各工人即於八時半重行工作、</p>

<h3>一九三七年度工部局預算書</h3>
<p>董事會審核議决　提交納稅人年會</p>
<p>一九三七年度工部局預算書、已於本月二十一日、經送請該局財務委員會審核、據財務處長報告、本年度之經常收入、除彌補上年度滾結欠欵七三八、七二○元外預計尚餘—一四三七一、○八○元、較上年之總收入减少四一○·六六○元、在預計之二四、三七一、○八○元中、已包括目七月一日起、增加房捐及地稅以後所可多收之數額、此種加捐計畫、經財務處長認為必要、加捐以後、所可多收之數額、共有一、二五八、○○○元、尚不足平衡預算、因此仍須自普通準備金提用大宗欵項、加捐以後之地稅、房捐界外馬路區域內之房捐、局產租金及碼頭捐等、預計分別可收四九四、○○○元、七○○、○○○元、九五、○○○元、五、○○○元及一○○○、○○○元、均較上年度所預算者為多、但執照費（預計可收九七、一○○元）公共及市政事業之收入預計二七、三六○元）以及雜項收入（預計六七一、六叫○元）、均較少於上年所預算之數額、且上年預算內有前年滾存餘欵、而本年預算、則須彌補上年之不足、因此上述各種捐稅所多收之部份、適相抵銷、繼常支出（包括普通市政經費及敎育經費）共計二六、一九七、三○○元、比上年减少五六七五六○元、各處支出已經在可能範圍以內、儘量緊縮、職員薪給依照職員經濟委員會之建議分別减少、但收支相抵尚虧短一、八二六、二二○元、因此擬自普通準備金內提用一、八五○、○○○元、此欵除彌補上述虧空外、尚餘一三、七八○元、</p>
<p>（特別收入及支出）特別收入預計二四、三九七、○○○元、其中包括自公積金內提用之一○、八九一、六一○元、以備償付一九二五年份及一九二七年份之公債、特別支出預計二四、三八六、九三○元、收支相抵、可餘一○、○七○元、</p>
<p>（捐稅）各種捐稅率在本年內均擬提高、分述如下、</p>
<p>甲·地稅自本年一月一日起至六月三十日止、稅率為千分之七、自七月一日起至下屆納稅人年會開會時止、稅率為千分之八、凡在公共租界內之地產、均按價格徵收、由租戶每半年預付一次、</p>
<p>乙·房捐自本年一月一日起至六月三十日止、捐率為百分之十四、自七月一日起至下屆納稅人年會開會時止捐率為百分之十六、凡在公共租界以內之房產、均按照估定之租價徵收、由住戶每季預付一次、</p>
<p>丙·特別房捐自本年一月一日起至六月三十日止、捐率為百分之十二、自七月一日起至下屆納稅人年會開會時止、捐率為百分之十四、凡在公共租界以外之房產、而其住戶享受公共租界內各種設施之利益（包括公用事業）者、均按照估定之租價徵收、由住戶每季預付一次、</p>
<p>增加房地捐一案、引起爭論頗多、茲略述討論經過如下、某委員主張、將加捐計晝之實行、延期一年、其理由略謂、各業凋敝已久、目前正在轉機、若實行加捐、勢必引起各界華人之堅决反對云、</p>
<p>財務處長謂、預算書中所開捐稅收人、經估計至最精確之程度、縱使加捐以後、（預計可多收入一百二十五萬餘元）、工部局之財政、仍感困難、</p>
<p>該委員又謂、據其所得之消息、局方在一九三六年上半年之捐稅收入、固然减少、但至下半年已經恢復、</p>
<p>財務處長謂、在去年下半年收稅較易、惟與所收之總額無干、</p>
<p>主席就財政之困難、加以說明、渠謂、各處房租、已减低三成之多、房租既經减低、若不提高捐率、必感入不敷出、渠請各委員注意、局方之預算、自一九二九年以來連年不能以正規之方法平衡、倘不於現在實行加捐、勢必須於來年增捐四釐、方可彌補、因此應於目前設法補救、以免將來更難應付、</p>
<p>財務處長說明、縱使自七月一日起實行加捐、來年之市政設施、無論在社會事業、或其他方面、尚無改良之可能、為平衡預算起見、須提用準備金一百八十餘萬元、</p>
<p>主席又謂、居民每月付房租十元者、僅增加負擔　角、付租較多者、依此類推、局方不能因此徵額之增加、而不使預算平衡、倘現在不設法補救、則來年加捐至百分之十八時、居民又將如何表示、</p>
<p>某委員謂、捐稅之大半數、係華人所繳納、因此若輩之意見、必須經鄭重考慮、實行加捐恐將　起華人之劇烈反對、至於預算之平衡、儘可以他種方法、達到目的、渠以為局方之支出、尚可縮减甚多、主席稱、社會各界、已有多數人士指摘工部局、謂局方對於市政設施之經費、過於緊縮、使居民感覺不便、如華人謂此方面之支出、尚可縮减、實無根據、</p>
<p>財務處長向各委員說明、局中各處之支出、業已撙節、例如工務處之預算中所開數目、為一九三二年以後之最少者、目前社會已遂漸繁榮、必須以正規之方法、平衡預算、至於準備金僅可以彌補將來之不足、並資助財政上之進展、</p>
<p>某委繼言、從前局方曾一度計劃增捐、渠即主張先行撙節支出、自採納此種主張、實行裁員减薪以後、華籍居民、頗為讚揚、在近十年間、除一九三六年外、所收房捐、逐年增多、去年因商業蕭條、致收入較少、但收捐成績至年底時、已漸有進步、本年可望更行轉佳、</p>
<p>財務處長謂、縱能多收一二十萬元、仍無濟於事、</p>
<p>主席謂、無論收捐成績如何轉佳、亦無法彌補約三百萬元之虧空、局方之準備金、業經逐漸動用、長此以往、局方之財政基礎、將不穩固、</p>
<p>某委員主張、如本年之收入仍不見增多、於來年實行加捐、主席云、局方之入不敷出、已有五年、若非經動用準備金、無法支持、因此加捐一舉、刻不容緩、</p>
<p>該委員又提出質問、謂局方之支出、每年多於收入、此等支出、是否應受限制、渠復申述納稅人之大部份為華籍居民、此問題應愼重處置、不可操之過急、</p>
<p>某委員謂、工部局之財政與商店之財政、究不相同、絕對無仔儲準備金之必要、</p>
<p>財務處長說明、所謂準備金、乃出售電氣處之收入、除去價據某某數種債欵後之餘額、此欵中有八百萬兩、已於一九三　年經指定為應付緊急用途及堅定將來預算之用、數年以來、遵此方針所動用之欵、已逾一千萬元、</p>
<p>某委員謂、照房租百分之一加捐、於下半年起實行、若將本年上下半年之捐率總合計算、所加者僅面分之一、</p>
<p>上述預算書、經財務委員會各委員考慮以後、送請董事會審核、各董事於本月二十四日詳細討論以後、議决、准如財務分員會所擬、將新訂捐稅表及九三七年度預算書提交納稅人年會云云、</p>

<h3>恩派亞戲院國際貿易局控賠償損失</h3>
<p>被告為徐培根及白玉霜兄　原告起訴要旨約分為五點</p>
<p>北平評劇蹦蹦戲女伶白玉霜、原名李桂貞、今年二十五歲、北平人、前在北平出演、因所演劇情淫蕩、攸關風化被平市政府下令驅逐出境、遂狼狽來滬、先寓貝勒路、現遷住愷自邇路建安里一號、經經營戲劇業之蘇州人徐培根（今年四十一歲住愛來格路一二七弄二號）之招待、介紹至霞飛路八十五號恩派亞戲院出演後、因白伶正當</p>
<p>花信年華　姿色動人、表演潘金蓮、馬寡婦開店、等戲時、處處表露其風騷淫蕩、因是頗得滬市一般觀衆之迷醉聲譽大噪　戲院方面、亦頗獲厚利、遂與白伶訂立長期出演合同、白伶方面由河北評劇團徐培根出面訂約、雙方訂立條件、如有一方違約、須賠償損失五千金、自上年三月十七日起、演至本年一月十二日、</p>
<p>停演一月　約定於二月十一日（即廢歴元旦）重行登台續演、白伶在休息期中、赴外埠無錫等處演唱、期滿返滬、斯時白伶因戀愛同班鼓手同鄉李繼先、乃其養母李卞氏深表不滿、力加反對、一面並迫李繼先離滬北返、致白伶感受非常之刺激、遂於二月初、不動聲色暗携所有金錢·衣飾，以出外送禮為名棄家</p>
<p>不別而行　自白出走後、徐培根與恩派亞戲院方面聞信大驚、即派人四出找尋、迄今仍杳無下落、當白出走後、其養母李卞氏即登報找尋、但恩派亞戲院於二月十一日開演之期、觀衆因白伶失踪、與院交涉紛紛吵鬧不休、經戲院方面報告捕房、派捕頭到場、維持秩序、并由</p>
<p>院方退票　惟白伶迄今月餘、仍未出現、戲院方面、以合同未滿期、受損不貲、近由恩派亞戲院統益公司經理張巨川（四十六歲鎮江人、住海寗路四一○號、）延律師代理、具狀特二法院民庭、對河北評劇團主徐培根·與白伶之兄李國璋（二十七歲、北平人，住愷自邇路達安里一號）提起損害賠償及違約金之訴、其起訴旨要分五點、㊀</p>

<p>賄賂之一　後譚楊上訴、對於此一案、因無積極證明、改判譚罪刑四年、惟徐益則對於譚焯宏部分、向上海地方法院自訴瀆職枉法裁判、而對於程李恬志及李泉深、則自訴為誣告罪、昨日上午、由李學燈推事開庭審理、先審自訴譚焯宏部分　譚未提到、僅徐益一造陳述程李恬志、李泉深、䚽由楊紹彭律師行賄譚焯宏、</p>

<h3>曹樹銘演講蘇聯的國防（續）</h3>
<p>第四·法津　蘇聯的法律在國防上也有極大的意義、就一般原則講蘇聯的法津沒有一句沒有一字不在嚴格的實行之中、最重要的、第一、間諜罪、蘇聯對於間諜罪在執行上毫不苟且、外國人如果在蘇聯實行間諜工作、一經發覺便毫不客氣地按照刑法立即判罪、關於間諜罪不論犯罪的人屬那一外國、都是一樣的依法執行、有時因此斷絕邦交也在所不惜、這是為什麼緣故呢、因為縱容間諜比斷絕邦交的害處來得格外多、格外大、第二、通間諜罪、蘇聯的人民如果被發覺有通間諜的嫌疑、換句話說、即是有漢奸的嫌疑、便得依法審判不論犯罪的人在黨國的地位如何必得依法判罪毫不姑息、這又是什麼緣故呢、因為姑息漢奸的結果便可產生更多的漢奸、更大的漢奸、為斬草除根起見、蘇聯便嚴格取締間諜和漢奸、這一點中是值得我們注意的、</p>
<p>第五·金融　一個國家的金融和一個國家的國防有極密切的關係、蘇聯的金融在國防上有以下幾個要點、</p>
<p>㊀金和銀都歸國有、現在蘇聯的人民不能私藏金和銀、如果違背這個原則、一經查出、便得沒收、併且坐罪、金和銀都集中在蘇聯國庫裏面、國庫充實所有國防上的一切比價都有着了、根據最近莫斯科的報告、蘇聯藏金之富僅次於美國、於此、更可見蘇聯國力之雄厚、</p>
<p>㊁外國的貨幣不能在蘇聯自由使用、凡帶外國貨幣的人到蘇聯、必得兌換盧布使用唯其如此、所以外國的貨幣不得紊亂蘇聯的金融、</p>
<p>㊂蘇聯的盧布自從去年和法國佛郎發生聯繋、用一定的比率兌價以後、蘇聯的幣制更進一步的穩固了、（未完）</p>
<h3>希望報工</h3>
<p>— 黃寄萍</p>
<p>上海市報業工會、報工子弟學校、今天同日舉行十週紀念大會，把過去十年的史實和今後一切的設施，報告給社會人士，所以在各報編纂特刋、承函約撰文，不勝榮幸；我初想沒有什麼意見，可以貢獻給報工，再一想，報工和我們記者，誼屬同行，正是站在一條戰綫上，所謂唇齒相依，休戚相關，即使沒有話說，也得胡說幾句：</p>
<p>第一：報工有報業工會，記者有記者公會，雖然名義和實質上容有不同，而團結一致、互相聯絡的本旨，彼此適相符合。照過去的事實來講，報工於自身的利害和組織的嚴密，似乎比記者們來得有精神，有實力，我向來很表同情。今後如能於訓練技術，修養品性方面再加研磨，十年之後，必有大成。</p>
<p>第二：報工們自始卽注意到子弟的敎育，十年來培植了許多良好的新少年，這眼光的確遠大，我想將來如能更進一步，添辦職業學校、公開招生，對鑄字，排字，拚版，澆版，凡印刷上各種技術，施以嚴格的訓練、養成專科的人才，那與報業前途更有密切的關係了。</p>
<p>第三：今天除了紀念會游藝會之外，更有中外報紙及印刷圖案（包括字模字體等）的展覽會、報工們費了幾許心血，造成此光明燦爛的盛舉，誠使我十分欽佩。今後甚願報工更能負起責任，和我們努力前進，前進！這裏篇幅有限，其餘的話，心照不宣。</p>
<p>來件</p>
<h3>現代政治與中國（續）</h3>
<p>— 君山</p>
<p>第一是軍事的對外失敗。在大戰時、這幾個國家的對外軍事統統失敗了、自然沒有從容的時間來處置政治。第二、因為軍事的失敗，便形成國民經濟的凋敝，國庫在大戰時用空了，而且還負了不少的戰債。第三，對外軍事失敗的結果，便引起了國內的不安，爆發大革命。同時，國內的政黨又無悠久的歷史，所謂代表民意、所謂共理國政，因為基礎不堅固，對國民貢獻也就太少了。在這個時候，有種特殊人才出來，他深深感到國家的危急存亡間不容髪，他又深深的覺得合議討論都不合目前的要求：因為強國處從容之境，它的政治還可以從容處理，而弱國處緊急之秋、則不能不有非常的措置。所以，他們自己挺身而出，負起復興民族復興祖國的責任。因此，我國可以說：今天世界上勝利的國家可以來從容地實行政黨政治：今天世界上失利的國家則只有實行一黨政治。今天世界上勝利的國家或可以來講合議政治：今天世界上失利的國家則只有走領袖政治這一條路。這統統是鐵一般的事實，不是我個人揑造的。</p>
<p>現在我們就回轉頭來看我們中國了。今天的中國是對外勝利嗎？是經濟發達嗎？是政黨有悠久歷史嗎？大家想想：我們能夠合得起那一個條件呢？這樣一種失敗了的國家，還要不自知醜地來學人家，學得一個四不像，這眞是可笑亦復可憐了。（朱完）</p>
<h3>祝“報業工會”十週年</h3>
<p>— 邵虛白</p>
<p>一個生命的誕生、是非常使人欣幸而寶實的事、可是，一個生命的成長，更值得我們欣幸而寶貴：我們常常聽到說”創業難，承業尤難”就是這個意思，無論拿動物植物來說，都不出此例、我們對於一個初生的生命，是說不出的愛好，對於一個已經成長的生命，自然更加愛好了！而且我們希望這已經成長的有更好的成長，他的生命將無盡止的延續，正比例的增加他的光榮！</p>
<p>“報業工會”這一個生命，在社會上生存已有十年了，在當初召開成立大會的時候，我想一定是受着很多人的熱望，大家都顧料這新生命漸漸成長，而發展他的事業，以造成他的光榮的史蹟的，時光一天天的過去，可以說只有一瞬目的工夫，已經是十年了，這並不算長的十年，“報業工會”着實有過非常的努力，為民族為國家為社會，為報業工友，都曾有極優越的貢獻，只要是對於工人運動稍微關心的人一定會知道他的功續的！</p>
<p>“十年”雖然不能說長，可是，在我們中國的環境裏、在這一個新陳代謝的時代裏，在這混沌的局面裏，一種社會團體能夠存在十年，確是一件不容易的事，他能夠存在，一定是經過了不知多少次的困難的，他曾為着這些困難而掙扎而奮鬥，自然，他在這掙扎與奮鬥的行動中，同時鍜煉着他的力量，我們翻開“報業工會”的大事記，看到他那種偉大的行程，那麼，我們便可以想到十年來的報業工會是如何的具有偉大的力量了；</p>
<p>一個偉大的事業家，他的發展的計劃是無窮止的，他的力量也只有一天一天的加大，他總是不畏挫折的向前幹，“報業工會”雖然有如此光榮的歷史，輝煌的功績，雄厚的力量，也是他前途並不止於此，他的生命將不知要延績到若干年、他為着紀念過去，他為着创造將来，那麼，他就應該絲毫不躊躇的把握着現在努力去幹，使他成為一個更偉大更光榮的集團！這是我對於報業工會的一個慶祝和希望！</p>
<p>同時，我們工人大衆，應該緊緊握着手，總動員的為民族為國家為社會為工人努力！</p>
<h3>本校十年來之回顧</h3>
<p>— 吳瑞書</p>
<p>本校剏設至今，倏已十稔，華路藍縷，推輪略備，瑞書忝長斯校，亦屆十稔，欣逢十周紀念之辰，用將本校十年來之經過，略陳如左，還希愛護本校者時賜鞭策，共底於成，實所潔幸焉。</p>
<p>本校由上海市報業職業工會同人所剏設，專以培養報業工人之子弟，如有餘額，則收外生，故取費極廉，除工人子弟分文不取外，卽外生亦略取書籍用品費，一切經費，悉由各大報館及工人捐助而來，每月經常開支，在初辦時，因僅有初級二敎室，不過百餘元，其後擴充敎室，添辦高級，至少須在四百五十元而外，而臨時費尚不在內，所收外界書籍用品費，除抵充臨時費外，幾無盈餘，猶幸工會同仁，熱心敎育、不辭艱辛，除每月繳納經常費外，更於年終臨時各捐助一工，故尚得出入相抵，然已捉襟見肘矣。</p>
<p>本校初辦之時，質莊家街吳姓房屋一所，僅有二敎室，學生祇七十二人，其後逐漸擴充，每學期增闢一敎室，因感校舍不敷，改遷西倉橋街分春秋兩季始業，學生最多時，達四百餘人，分八敎室，然皆限於初組，是時以尚在草創時代，未曾依法立案，至民國十九年，始正式設立校董會，呈准市敎育局立案，給予證書，頒發鈐記，後適逢一二八之役，城內幾遷避一空，戶口，學生驟形减少，因改為六敎室，遷至小桃園十六號，至二十三年度上學期，經校董會决議，將春季始業取消，添辦高級，仍設六敎室，於是始成立完全小學，去歲以校址狹小，不敷容納，又遷移至西倉路六十號，本學期計學生三百五十七人，工人子弟約占半數，本年暑假，六年級更將辦理第一屆畢業本校在民國二十四年前，以未設高級故，僅至四年級為止，計初級畢業，共辦十一屆。畢業學生，共有一百六十九人，其中升學者，約占十分之六、餘則多從事商業，然升學後再入中學者，竟不足十分之二，餘皆於高小畢業後投入商界，若女生則以家庭服務者為多現在中學肆業者恐尚不足十人</p>
<p>瑞書尸位至今，亦已十稔，毫無建樹，自問心傀，而以生活所迫，未克專任，更多隕越，幸承報業同仁及各校董主政於上，各敎員劻勷於下，當不致為方家所鄙棄，今後當益勉力從事，以期母負辦理者之初心，還希時賜敎益，匡所不逮，則不特瑞書身受其賜，即莘莘學子亦受益無窮，是所三薰三沐以拜禱者也。</p>

<h3>舉人戲</h3>
<p>— 葉紅</p>
<p>篁村是M縣的一個小鄉鎮。這幾天來，村裏的空氯突然緊張得很，說是有個“舉人公”從城裏回來娶親，還要拜祖和做舉人戲，藉這榮宗耀祖，增增“舉人公”的威風。</p>
<p>這消息一下子便傳遍了全村，村裏每個人的臉上都掛着得意的笑容。那些父老們更是忙個不了，早集祠，晚集祠，幾乎連幾根“羊公鬚“都要忙掉了。</p>
<p>在那太祖祠改造的鄉立小學前，突起了一座高高的，用葵葉搭成的戲棚，棚頂上還豎起一支青天白日的國旗，臨風飄着。父老們每次跑過，總得站着，引長了𩓐子瞧一會兒，睜開那摺着無數皺紋的老花眼，摸摸下巴的鬍鬚，心裏也像有些飄飄然的樣子。</p>
<p>那所鄉立小學，幾天前便放了假，敎師們早就溜之大吉了。那些小學生樂得跟着野孩子滿村瞎跑。</p>
<p>吉日到來了，村中的人們活像蛹蛆般騷動着，各人的臉上都喜氣洋洋，怪得意的。</p>
<p>當天，太祖祠裏打掃得乾乾凈凈，神座上擺着三牲果品之類的東西，點着長明燈，燒起了神香和蠟燭。兩旁的官座椅上，舖上大紅色的墊子。那些父老們也都穿着出色的袍褂，像煞有介事地，在祖祠裏出出進進。</p>
<p>到了擇定的吉時，鄉長老爺下令全村的勇兵，武裝起來，護押着肩輿恭迎“舉”駕。鄉紳們滿臉春風地跑在前頭，沿途燃放着鞭砲，響着大鑼大鼓，夾着武夫們的吆喝，形成一片嘈雜的吵聲。窄窄的村道塞滿着人，熱鬧得像菩薩爺爺出遊一般，一路浩浩蕩蕩，朝着太祖祠來。</p>
<p>“舉人公”穿着長袍馬褂，雍容地下了肩輿，給一羣父老鄉紳擁進太祖祠去。太祖祠門前弔着的一大串炮仗，便劈劈拍拍地燃起來了。跟着，戲台上的鑼鼓，笛子也一齊吹打起來，鬧得轟天動地。</p>
<p>一會兒，“舉人婆”也坐着八人抬的大紅轎子來了。這時太祖祠前的人，更塞得水洩不通。</p>
<p>“看舉人公呀！”</p>
<p>“看舉人婆哪！”</p>
<p>男男女女都拉長了𩓐子擠來擠去，爭先恐後的擠進太祖祠裏。</p>
<p>“舉人公”和“舉人婆”，雙雙朝着神位行了三跪九叩的大禮後，好容易才由父老鄉紳們引着，在人叢中掙扎着，登上戲棚的廂子裏。於是，那幾百顆眼珠都集中到戲棚上了。片刻，台上就開始演唱“八仙賀壽”，博得台下無數的喝彩聲。</p>
<p>當晚，太祖祠裏擺着幾百塊錢的“舉人酒”，第二天還得來一頓“謝酌”。</p>
<p>同時，大祖祠的門前，高高地貼着一塊黃紙紅字大的幅絛：</p>
<p>“捷報貴祠先生×印x×，由國立××大學法學院經濟系修業期滿，蒙國民政府敎育部長×國立x×大學校長×會同考試，取錄最優等畢業一名，授予法學土位，呈請國民政府註冊，准予高等文官法官任用，指日榮陞。”</p>
<p>這一張幅條，襯着太祖祠前那副“光前裕後，尊祖敬宗”的對子，互相輝映着。</p>

<h3>Kato Arrives in Tianjin to Exchange Views with Japanese Economic Circles</h3>
<p>Also Invites Chinese and Japanese Dignitaries to a Tea Party, Li Si-hao Also Rushes to Attend</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Kato arrived in Tianjin at 11:00 AM on the 25th via the Puning-Shanghai through train. He attended a banquet hosted by the Japanese economic and banking circles in Tianjin at noon. At 5:00 PM, he attended a symposium held at the Consul General's residence in the British Concession, hosted by Consul General Horiuchi, Staff Officer Asai, and the head of the Horiye Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as well as leaders of the Japanese economic and business circles in Tianjin, to exchange views on the financial and economic situation in North China. At 6:00 PM, Kato invited figures from various Chinese and Japanese circles to a tea party at the Astor House Hotel in the British Concession. Li Si-hao rushed to attend on the morning of the 25th, and Zhang Zizhong and others also participated. Li said that Ikeda, the chief of the Third Section of the Japanese Army Department, has returned to his country to request instructions on economic issues and will return to Tianjin in about ten days to observe the economic cooperation between China and Japan in North China. Negotiations have stalled, and concrete measures that have been discussed have not been implemented due to unresolved funding issues. I attended the tea party called by Kato today and will return to Peiping afterward. I will visit again in a few days to meet with relevant parties (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Kato visited the Tianjin office of the South Manchuria Railway and the branch office of the China Company at 1:00 PM on the 25th, as well as the garrison headquarters. According to reports, this delegation came because it was pessimistic about the prospects for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. Taking advantage of the convening of the first general meeting of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, they hoped to break the deadlock through economic cooperation. Members of both sides met with sincerity and exchanged views earnestly, but the results still failed to break the pessimistic situation. However, economic and business circles between the two countries have become closer due to this meeting. The reason why the deadlock could not be broken is that the North China issue is one of the factors. Whether the relations between the two countries will change in the future depends on this as the focus. After the delegation returns to the country, it will truthfully inform the people of the situation it has obtained and urge them to consider the actual situation and properly handle their policy toward China (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Kato is scheduled to visit Tashiro on the morning of the 26th to exchange views on economic cooperation with China (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Contents of the Draft Central Reserve Bank Law</h3>
<p>Capital of 50 Million Yuan, Share Capital Divided into Two Types</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The draft law on reorganizing the Central Bank, which was passed by the Central Political Council, will soon be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review and is expected to complete the legislative process in the short term. The name of the draft law was originally proposed as the Draft Central Reserve Bank Law during the review by the Legal, Financial, and Economic Committees of the Central Political Council. However, when the Central Political Council passed the bill, it changed the name of the bank to the Central Reserve Bank, abbreviated as the Central Bank, and the name of the bill should also be changed to the Draft Central Reserve Bank Law. According to reporters, the spirit of the Draft Central Reserve Bank Law lies in establishing the bank in a detached position. Therefore, it has been decided that the governor of the bank will be a full-time position and cannot hold concurrent positions. The bank's capital has been changed from the original 100 million yuan to 50 million yuan. The reason for this is that the bank's responsibility is to adjust the financial situation and stabilize the currency to fulfill the function of a "bank of banks" and not to make profits. If there is too much capital, the allocated official interest dividends will also be high, which will increase the burden on the bank. Furthermore, the statutory reserves received by the bank will be substantial and can be used freely. Secondly, the bank's share capital is divided into two types: 40% official shares and 60% commercial shares. The official shares are purchased by the National Government, and half of the commercial shares are purchased by domestic legal entities engaged in banking and money businesses, and half are purchased by domestic citizens. This method is intended to show that it is jointly owned by the people and demonstrates impartiality. In addition, the bank will enjoy the sole privilege of issuing legal tender and opening gold coupons. However, the amount of issuance and the amount of reserves must be fully disclosed to protect the credit of the legal tender. In addition, the bank's handling of rediscounts must be able to meet the needs of industry and commerce. Other aspects regarding the bank's administrative organization are largely the same as the current law (Central News Agency Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>French Aviation Technical Supervisor Praises China's Aviation Industry</h3>
<p>Great Success in Developing Transportation, Comparable to Europe and America</p>
<p>[Paris] Colonel Michel-Hirsut, French Civil Aviation Technical Supervisor, who visited China in October last year to inspect the aviation industry, recently published an article in a pictorial weekly entitled "Travel Notes in China", praising China's aviation industry, especially its speed. He said, "Currently, it takes eleven days to fly from Paris or London to Shanghai, but from the end of this year, the Paris-Hanoi section can be shortened, requiring only seven days." In the next year or two, there will be three or four flights a week on the Anglo-French Far East air route. It will only take one week to reach the capital cities of European countries from Shanghai. At the same time, after the opening of the American air route, it will only take one week to fly from San Francisco to Hong Kong. Within China, "flying from Shanghai to Nanjing is faster than flying from Paris to Brussels, with two round trips every day, even on Sundays. This kind of convenience is not available on European air routes. Flying from Shanghai along the Yangtze River to Hankou and Chongqing is comparable to flying from Paris to Bucharest, and there is one flight every day, without interruption throughout the year, which is especially commendable. In addition, it takes one day to fly from Shanghai to Guangzhou or Hong Kong, and only two days to fly to Hanoi. In short, China's aviation industry is very complete, which is obvious even to the most casual observer. Given China's vast territory, railways and highways are insufficient, and waterway transportation is too slow, the aviation industry is naturally successful. Therefore, every time a plane takes off, all the seats are sold out, and the plane is full of goods and mail. The prosperity of the business is evident. In addition to the speed of the flights, the timing is also very accurate, comparable to the best-managed routes in Europe. In addition, the fares are low, comparable to the fares of international sleeping cars, so it is well-received." (Central News Agency Havana dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>The Issue of Abolishing Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The Third Plenary Session decided on the case of "continuing to negotiate with various countries to abolish consular jurisdiction." The National Government has ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to earnestly handle it. Recently, the Shanghai legal community has also advocated petitioning the government to abolish it automatically to seek the integrity of China's legal rights. This suggestion is especially worthy of our attention today, when unscrupulous foreigners use consular jurisdiction as a shield, running rampant and illegally, hindering China's exercise of territorial sovereignty.</p>
<p>The great powers obtained consular jurisdiction in China based not on the principles of international law, but on the provisions of unequal treaties. After the European War, China believed that the existence of this system was sufficient to hinder the integrity of China's legal rights and requested its abolition at the Paris Peace Conference, but it was not approved by the countries. In 1921, the United States convened the Washington Conference to discuss the Far East issue. The Chinese representatives once again raised this request, but it was still ineffective. After the establishment of the National Government, it revised commercial treaties with various countries. Although a few countries abolished their consular jurisdiction, the countries that still enjoy consular jurisdiction in China today include the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Japan, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Portugal, Denmark, the Netherlands, Peru, Belgium, Brazil, Mexico, and others.</p>
<p>The consular jurisdiction system itself has many shortcomings. The first is the uneven application of laws. The jurisdiction of consular jurisdiction depends on the nationality of the defendant. However, the laws of various countries are not exactly the same. The same act may be considered guilty in Consulate A, but innocent in Consulate B. Therefore, there are often cases with the same facts, but with very different crimes and punishments. The second is that consulates have no jurisdiction over foreign witnesses and plaintiffs. If the witnesses required in the case have a different nationality from the defendant, the consulate cannot force them to appear in court to testify. Even if they voluntarily testify and their statements are false, the consulate cannot impose a perjury charge. The same applies to the plaintiff. If the defendant files a counterclaim against the plaintiff, the consulate has no power to hear the case because it has no jurisdiction over foreign plaintiffs. The third is that it is not easy to collect evidence when foreigners commit crimes in the Chinese interior. If a foreigner traveling in the Chinese interior commits a crime, according to the treaty, he should be "sent to the nearest consul for punishment. Only detention is allowed along the way, and no abuse is allowed." This provision is tantamount to saying that foreigners traveling in the Chinese interior, even if they commit crimes such as disturbing public morals or intentional homicide, must be escorted to the consulate in the treaty port, which is thousands of miles away, for punishment. In places with inconvenient transportation, it takes a long time to escort them thousands of miles. It is even more difficult to collect evidence by the time of the trial. The fourth is that the duties of consular officials and judges conflict with each other. The duty of consular officials is to protect the interests of their own nationals. Now, cases in which nationals of other countries sue their own nationals are handed over to them for trial. The duty of protection is incompatible with the duty of judgment, and it is difficult to expect fair and impartial judgment. Judging from the above four shortcomings alone, the consular jurisdiction system should have been abolished long ago.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is also one point that we cannot tolerate. The existence of consular jurisdiction is a major infringement of China's sovereignty. This is enough for unscrupulous foreigners to use as a shield, disturbing public order and acting recklessly within China's borders. It may even induce traitors to change their nationality to another country and commit crimes. China's courts have no way to punish them. For example, the recent rampant smuggling and drug trafficking in various places and the establishment of special agencies can be traced back to the root cause of consular jurisdiction. Therefore, under the two major current goals of unified construction and national revival, we must fully support the government and promote the abolition of consular jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Minister Ciano Arrives in the Capital of Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Political Agreement Could Be Reached Very Soon, Both Sides Respect Territorial Integrity, The Little Entente Countries Pay Great Attention</p>
<p>⊙Capital of Yugoslavia Count Ciano, the Italian Foreign Minister, arrived here at 9:30 this morning, accompanied by the Yugoslav Ambassador to Italy, Duchic, and the Italian Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Entelli. The Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Stojadinović, along with important military and political figures (including Army Minister General Molich), welcomed him at the station. The station and nearby streets were hung with the flags of Italy and Yugoslavia. The crowds gathered along the way and cheered to pay their respects. After Ciano got out of the car, he shook hands with Stojadinović as a courtesy. The military band of the 18th Infantry Regiment played the national anthems of Italy and Yugoslavia. Ciano then performed a Fascist salute to thank them. He then boarded a car and left the station. He is scheduled to meet with Regent Prince Paul this morning and attend a banquet at the Taiteni Palace this evening. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>⊙Capital of Yugoslavia After the arrival of Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano, responsible officials stated that the political and economic agreement that the two sides should establish could be signed this afternoon or tomorrow. The political part will include solutions to various outstanding issues between the two sides, and will be accompanied by a declaration stating respect for territorial integrity, the content of which is the same as the friendly treaties previously signed between Italy and Greece and between Italy and Turkey. Local authorities stated that Yugoslavia's attitude towards Italy has not changed as a result, only restoring the original position. Although Italy's attitude is different from before, Yugoslavia accepts it, and does not want to change its general policy or weaken its existing international obligations. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The main purpose of Count Ciano's visit to the capital of Yugoslavia is to conclude a political treaty, not a commercial treaty. This news seems to have been confirmed. According to the well-informed "Italian Daily News," the political agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia will definitely enhance the friendly relations between the two countries. It also stated that the content of this political agreement has not yet been announced, but it must be more important than the friendly treaty signed between Italy and Yugoslavia several years ago. (National Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Foreign affairs officials here attach great importance to the Foreign Minister's trip, believing that the mutual approach between Italy and Yugoslavia is aimed at dismantling the Little Entente group. What Yugoslavia is uneasy about are two main crises: first, the demands made by neighboring countries, especially Hungary and Italy, regarding territorial issues; second, the restoration of the Habsburg former royal family in Austria. Regarding the first level, the Italian authorities are currently encouraging Hungary to make territorial demands on Czechoslovakia, but not on Yugoslavia. As for Italy's approach to Yugoslavia, although it may not make concrete guarantees on the demands it made on Dalmatia, it should give up the idea of interfering. Regarding the second level, Italy has also recently expressed its opposition. Therefore, Yugoslavia's opposition attitude can be supported by Italy, and with the support of Czechoslovakia and Romania, it will be even more powerful. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>⊙Bucharest, Romania The Little Entente countries are quite worried about the unexpected visit to Yugoslavia by Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano. The Yugoslav Ambassador here, Gazhidulaj, has visited Romanian Foreign Minister Endonescu to dispel these concerns. It is said that he has guaranteed that Yugoslavia will not take any action before consulting with the Little Entente countries. He also stated that as of last month, Yugoslavia had not concluded an agreement with Italy. Today, Romanian newspapers reported that Yugoslavia seems to want to establish a close alliance with Italy before the Little Entente conference. It is believed here that the Yugoslav Ambassador's informal statement is in response to this report. (National Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>⊙Bucharest, Romania The political circles here are very surprised to hear that Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano is scheduled to visit the capital of Yugoslavia tomorrow. The Yugoslav government recently notified the Romanian government that the talks with Italy may not be concluded in the short term. It is generally believed that Ciano's trip was initiated by the Italian side, and its purpose is to use all means to reach an understanding with Yugoslavia, which can be regarded as a victory for Italian diplomacy on the one hand, and can also disrupt the hearts of the Little Entente countries on the other hand. Among officials in Romania, due to Yugoslavia's guarantee that the agreement that Italy and Yugoslavia can reach is purely based on the Anglo-Italian agreement on the Mediterranean, and will not endanger the solidarity of the Little Entente group, they still remain calm about Count Ciano's trip. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>[London] The sudden trip of Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano to Yugoslavia has surprised observers here. It is generally believed that there has been a sudden progress in the negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia. This should be related to the European tense situation caused by Italy's hardened attitude towards the Spanish incident. If Italy decides to continue to interfere in the Spanish Civil War, it will have to take a moderate attitude in Central Europe and approach Yugoslavia. However, it is doubtful whether the Yugoslav government is willing to conclude an agreement with Italy before the Little Entente's regular political conference, which will be held in the capital of Czechoslovakia at the beginning of next month. It is generally predicted that if an agreement is concluded between Italy and Yugoslavia, its contents will roughly stipulate that Italy will purchase raw materials produced in Yugoslavia, and in exchange, Yugoslavia will recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia.

<h3>Italy Forms Special Detachment to Participate in Spanish Civil War</h3>
<p>Secret Documents on the Italian Prisoners Disclosed by French Newspapers</p>
<p>[Paris] After the Spanish Republican government released a secret document seized from Italian prisoners, the French Socialist Party's organ newspaper, "Le Populaire," reprinted it. This document was issued by the Roman military authorities to the commanders of the troops in Florence, Naples, and Cagliari, and the director of the artillery department on January 13. Its content was to form a special force to meet the needs of the Spanish war. It also contained detailed instructions on the supply of military equipment, including three submachine guns, ten machine guns, six million rounds of ammunition, and 120,000 hand grenades per battalion. This special force was required to board ships in the port of Naples before January 21 and set sail for Spain. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Observation Mission, Mission to England</h3>
<p>Discussing China Problems, Adjusting Relations Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Sato stated in the parliament that the policy towards England should be for England and Japan to adjust the China problem through cooperation in order to restore friendly relations with England. Therefore, the mission of the economic observation mission that will go to England will also provide assistance to the government's policy from the side, negotiating on the following issues: (1) Trade problems between England and Japan; (2) Trade problems between England and Japan in British colonies; (3) Trade problems between England and Japan in third-country markets; (4) Resource development problems in British colonies.</p>
<p>Also, because England is worried about Japan's attitude towards China when implementing its economic policy towards China, the observation mission will explain that Japan has no political ambitions towards China and strive to eliminate its misunderstandings. At the same time, it will report on Japan's work in China, based on the results of Kodama's visit to China, etc., and the situation of peaceful development, and discuss with the British authorities various issues concerning China between England and Japan, such as stabilizing currency, tariffs, developing resources, and investment.

<h3>Economic Agreement Between Japan and Italy</h3>
<p>Can be Established Within a Day</p>
<p>[Rome] According to well-informed sources, the economic agreement between Japan and Italy is about to be signed, possibly before the end of this month. The main clause of this agreement stipulates that the trade rights that Japan currently enjoys in Italy can be extended to all territories of the Italian Empire, so Japan can consolidate its trade position in Abyssinia. Well-informed sources also said that Italy originally enjoyed the right to permanently lease land in Nagasaki, Yokohama, Kobe, and other places in Japan. Japan wants Italy to give up this right. This matter is currently being discussed between Japan and Italy. Apart from this, it seems unlikely that Japan and Italy will sign any political agreements.

<p>More Than 20,000 People Participate</p>
<p>⊙Kuala Lumpur The current situation of the strike in the Federated Malay States is still serious. It is estimated that 25,000 Chinese workers are on strike, including rubber plantation coolies and miners who have responded out of sympathy. Forty-four rubber plantations have been affected, covering an area of 75,000 acres. The strikers are now taking a tough stance. Representatives of the Malayan Planters' Association and the government met this morning to discuss the current situation. The government representative later sought to consult with representatives of the strikers, but it is not yet certain whether they are willing to meet with the government representative.

<p>⊙ Lansing, Michigan: The workers belonging to the Chrysler plant in Detroit have been occupying the factory buildings since declaring a strike on the 8th of this month. Although ordered by the court to withdraw, 6,000 workers have remained in the eight factory locations. After repeated meetings between management representatives and auto union representatives, the workers have now agreed to withdraw within today. The main cause of this strike, the issue of the union's right to represent workers in signing labor contracts, will be discussed in another meeting between labor and management this afternoon. Factory authorities, it is reported, have agreed to not resume work during the negotiations, in order to carefully consider the situation and thus reach a solution.

<h3>British Prime Minister's Status to Be Legalized</h3>
<p>Purpose of Pay Increase Bill</p>
<p>[London] According to today's announcement, the purpose of the bill to increase the annual salaries of the Prime Minister and cabinet ministers is approximately: 1) to eliminate various irregularities under the current system; 2) to change the current system and reallocate cabinet ministers who should be in both houses. From now on, the annual salary of all cabinet ministers will be uniformly £5,000. Furthermore, the position of Prime Minister has not previously been legally recognized, and there has been no previous provision for a Prime Minister's annual salary. The Prime Minister's annual salary, as a matter of custom, has only been paid because he concurrently holds the position of First Lord of the Treasury. After the introduction of this pay increase bill, the Prime Minister's position can be legally established, and the connection between the Prime Minister and the First Lord of the Treasury can be given a historical basis. In addition, the bill stipulates that the Prime Minister who also serves as First Lord of the Treasury shall receive an annual pension of £2,000 after retirement, and the leader of the opposition party in the House of Commons with the most seats can also receive an annual salary of £1,000. Furthermore, for ministers with an annual salary of £5,000, their parliamentary undersecretaries will receive an annual salary of £1,500. If a minister's annual salary is £3,000, then the parliamentary undersecretary will receive £1,200. According to this bill, the total annual salary of all cabinet members will increase by £37,000 compared to the current amount. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Italy Refuses to Withdraw Volunteers, Recognizes Grave Situation</h3>
<p>Requests German Ambassador to Advise Italy, Suggests Effective Measures to Britain. Britain Calmly Believes Italy May Soften.</p>
<p>[Paris] Foreign Minister Delbos held separate talks with British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps and German Ambassador Welczeck this afternoon, discussing the situation arising from Italian Ambassador to the UK Grandi's refusal to discuss the issue of volunteer withdrawal at the London Adjustment Committee yesterday. It is said that these talks were extremely important. According to responsible sources, Delbos explained to the British and German ambassadors that the current situation is extremely serious and requires immediate efforts to salvage it. Regarding Italy's violation of the agreement prohibiting volunteers from going to Spain, he said that although there is no official evidence at this time, based on information from various sources and observations of photos taken on the Spanish front lines, as well as military orders found on captured Italian soldiers, it is sufficient to believe that Italy did indeed send troops to Spain after February 20th. In addition, Delbos strongly urged Welczeck to convey to the German government a request to exert pressure on Italy to adopt a more moderate attitude. Responsible sources also said that breaches of the non-intervention agreement are numerous. Until recently, France has always shown a spirit of compromise and forbearance. However, if the freedom of transportation between France and its colonies, as well as Britain's "Imperial Routes," are endangered by the current situation in Spain, then France's tolerance and forbearance will not be without limits, and Britain and France should immediately adopt a common attitude, implementing effective monitoring of Spanish ports to prevent foreign troops from continuing to land in Spain. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[London] British political circles are currently taking a calm attitude towards Italy's refusal to withdraw Italian volunteers from Spain, believing that Italy's attitude is not unchangeable. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>[Paris] French Foreign Minister Delbos told the British and German ambassadors today that if Italy sends more troops to Spain, France intends to request the League of Nations to take international naval action, and therefore asks Germany to dissuade Italy from sending more troops. (24th, National News)</p>
<p>[Paris] Following a lengthy conversation between Foreign Minister Delbos and British Ambassador to France, Sir Eric Phipps, the European edition of the New York Evening Post reports that the conversation concerned the potential for the British and French navies to blockade the ports of the Spanish Nationalist forces if Italy continues to refuse to recall its volunteers currently in Spain. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding Italy's aid to the Spanish Nationalist forces, it is rumored that the Spanish Republican government intends to file a complaint with the League of Nations. League of Nations officials believe that if Spain does file a complaint, it will be based on Articles 10 and 11 of the Covenant. However, the London Adjustment Committee is currently discussing the withdrawal of foreign volunteers, and before the results of the discussion are revealed, the Spanish Republican government is unlikely to file a complaint hastily. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Rome] An Italian spokesman declared today that if France requests the League of Nations to intervene in the issue of Italy sending volunteers to fight in Spain, the Spanish Civil War may lead to a second European war. He also firmly denied that Italy had continued to send volunteers to Spain after the non-intervention agreement took effect, saying that this was a Communist lie. (25th, National News)</p>
<h3>Intense Debate Between Russia and Italy at the Non-Intervention Committee</h3>
<p>Russian Ambassador Proposes Sending an Investigation Team, German Ambassador Speaks Out Against Communism</p>
<p>[London] At today's meeting of the Committee on Non-Intervention in Spain, Soviet representative Maisky spoke, asking the full committee to pay attention to the Italian government's increasing military intervention in Spain. The Soviet government has received reliable information that in mid-February, there were no fewer than 60,000 Italian soldiers in Spain, and it is believed that this number has since greatly increased. The so-called Italian volunteers are organized into units, led by Italian officers and generals, and have arrived in Spain with a sufficient supply of Italian-made weapons. At least a large part of this force has been drawn from the Italian regular army. All these facts give us sufficient reason to regard the Italian government's actions as one of the most arbitrary cases of foreign intervention in history. In terms of needing so many troops, this action is tantamount to an Italian invasion of a foreign country. According to international law and the League of Nations Covenant, this is a violent act of military aggression against a foreign country. The Soviet government specifically puts forward the following suggestions:</p>
<p>1.  The Committee on Non-Intervention should immediately investigate the veracity of the matters listed in the Spanish government's note to the League of Nations on March 13th.</p>
<p>2.  A special investigation committee should be organized immediately and sent to Spain to undertake the following tasks: (A) Investigate the landing of so-called Italian volunteers in Spain after February 20th and the shipment of arms and ammunition from Italy and other sources to General Franco; (B) Investigate the participation of parts of the Italian regular army in the war against the Spanish government; (C) Report to the Committee.</p>
<p>Chairman Lord Plymouth stated that the issue proposed by the Soviet representative was not on the agenda and that the representative had not notified him in advance. Italian representative Grandi rose and said that the provocative remarks made by the representative of Communist Russia would receive a due response from the Fascist Italian government. The German representative called Maisky's remarks astonishingly hypocritical. The French representative suggested that Maisky's suggestion should be referred to a subcommittee for consideration, which was supported by the chairman. The Portuguese representative said that the Soviet Union had previously made unfounded accusations, and that this kind of behavior, if continued, would greatly harm the work of the Committee and world peace. The Soviet representative insisted that, according to the rules of procedure, any actions that are reasonably believed to be in violation of the non-intervention agreement may be raised in the meeting. The German representative also agreed that this matter should be discussed by the subcommittee. He earnestly hoped to prevent the current Non-Intervention Committee from becoming a propaganda committee. He feared that Maisky's remarks would be used as propaganda material by newspapers around the world within hours. The German representative also stated that the current turmoil in Spain was entirely caused by the Communist International. The German representative also asked whether the work of the committee should be regarded as confidential, as newspapers had published false and incomplete news about the discussions of the subcommittee yesterday, even before they were completed, summarizing the main points of the discussion. The German representative asked for assurances that the work of the committee would not be misused for propaganda or the dissemination of unfounded slanders, otherwise each representative should be free to provide information to the newspapers. The German representative then reserved his government's position regarding the slanderous accusations against the Italian government. Chairman Lord Plymouth, after the representatives had spoken, stated that it was his intention that the issue raised by the Soviet Union should be referred to the subcommittee for whatever action it deemed appropriate, and it was decided that the issue should be discussed in the existing manner. As for the meeting situation of the Non-Intervention Committee and the subcommittee, it has been repeatedly decided in the past that strict confidentiality should be maintained.

<h3>Spanish Government Forces Capture 1,300 Italian Soldiers</h3>
<p>Valencia: Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent: On the Guadalajara front, the government forces have captured a total of 1,300 Italian prisoners so far. It is expected that this number will continue to increase. Among them, 290 have been sent to a barracks here for detention, including four officers. The officers are housed separately, and all prisoners are allowed to walk freely in the open space of the barracks. Only one Italian soldier named Gigliyanuari is allowed to travel freely throughout the city because he voluntarily escaped from the Italian camp near Briyhuga and surrendered to the government forces, bringing with him 30 hand grenades and many clips of bullets, and is therefore given special treatment.

<h3>Spanish Sea and Land Surveillance Plan</h3>
<p>Fully Implemented Next Week</p>
<p>[London] The Adjustment Committee of the Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Measures held a plenary session at 4 PM this afternoon and immediately appointed the directors of each seaport surveillance to preside over ship inspection matters, so that they can perform their duties starting on the 29th of this month. The Italian representative, Italian Ambassador to the UK Grandi, expressed his approval of the personnel appointed by the Adjustment Committee, so the entire surveillance plan can be implemented thereafter.

<p>[Paris] Britain, France, Germany, and Italy have today intensified the neutral blockade of Spain. France has ordered the Atlantic Fleet to serve in the Mediterranean from April 8th. The fleet originally stationed in the Mediterranean will be transferred to patrol the area designated by the Non-Intervention Committee. It is said that Italy also intends to expand its patrol area, paying special attention to ships sailing from Marseilles, Sète, and Vendres in France to Barcelona and Valencia, monitoring them outside French territorial waters. Therefore, in theory, the borders of Spain can be effectively blockaded, and no further external assistance can be obtained. However, in practice, the non-intervention policies adopted by various countries are very different. It is reported that Soviet Russia has rejected the demands of Italy and Germany, refusing to allow the two countries to manage Spain's foreign deposits. Britain is trying its best to break the deadlock through diplomatic means. (24th, National News)</p>
<p>[London] In view of the still very serious situation in Spain, the Admiralty has taken various measures to deal with it: 1) Sending the repair ship "Cyclops" to the port of Barcelona in Spain; 2) Sending the 10,000-ton cruiser "Shropshire" to the port of Valencia in Spain; 3) Sending the hospital ship "Maine" to the port of Alicante in Spain; 4) Sending the destroyer "Cossack" to the port of Palma in the Balearic Islands in Spain; 5) Sending the destroyers "Echo" and "Grafton" to the port of Cartagena in Spain; 6) Sending the battleship "Queen Elizabeth" and four destroyers to the port of Gibraltar in British territory; 7) Sending the cruiser "Devonshire" and the destroyer "Galatea" to the port of Tangier in neutral international territory in North Africa; 8) Sending four destroyers to the port of Jouanterus in southwestern France. The above measures are not much different from those already taken before the spring exercises. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, semi-official sources recently declared that French Foreign Minister Delbos and British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps, at their meeting the day before yesterday, had agreed to continue implementing non-intervention measures through the London Adjustment Committee, without resorting to the League of Nations. It was also said that recent news from Spain is sufficient to prove that the measure prohibiting volunteers from going to that country has indeed been effective since its implementation on the 20th of last month. Therefore, the strengthening of the surveillance plan will be fully implemented within the next week. In addition, although Italian Ambassador Grandi stated in the subcommittee the day before yesterday that he refused to discuss the issue of volunteer withdrawal, it is generally expected that it will still be brought up for discussion once the Adjustment Committee continues to meet after Easter.

<h3>Belgium Seeks to Maintain Independent Status</h3>
<p>Adopts Three Policies</p>
<p>⊙ Brussels: Regarding the new system that Belgium intends to establish internationally, responsible sources recently declared that our goal is to maintain independence. The policies that our country can adopt are no more than three points:</p>
<p>1.  When a war breaks out in Europe and Belgium's independence is thereby threatened, Belgium should have the right to decide what position it should take.</p>
<p>2.  Belgium has decided to respect all existing international obligations, including those stipulated by the League of Nations Covenant. However, regarding the passage of foreign troops through its territory, it will require the countries concerned to confirm this in order to show limitations.</p>
<p>3.  The issue of whether to maintain or abolish the military mutual assistance measures established by the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium in September of last year, although it is the most difficult thing to resolve in the current negotiations between the countries concerned, Belgium does not refuse to have the three general staffs conduct talks when necessary. In short, if Germany has a conflict with its neighboring countries in Eastern Europe, Belgium is determined not to get caught up in the vortex. If foreign aircraft fly over Belgian airspace, the Belgian government will consider it a challenge. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Japan Signs Documents with Britain and the United States to Abolish Perpetual Land Leases</h3>
<p>Elimination of the Last Remnants of Extraterritoriality: A Memorable Page in Japanese Diplomatic History</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Satō and British Ambassador Clive signed official documents at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, containing an understanding to abolish the perpetual land lease rights enjoyed by British residents in Japan. Shortly thereafter, the Foreign Minister also signed similar official documents with US Ambassador Grew. The documents stipulate: 1) The perpetual land lease system will be abolished on April 1, 1942, at which time the lease rights will be converted into land ownership without compensation; 2) The current state of tax exemption should be maintained. The Japanese authorities will no longer make any claims for unpaid taxes. The Japanese newspapers all welcome this new compromise, considering it the elimination of the last remnants of extraterritoriality and new evidence of Anglo-Japanese and American-Japanese friendship. They are especially grateful to Britain for taking the initiative to resolve this troublesome issue. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs mentioned this matter, recounting the origin of the perpetual land lease system and the difficulties encountered in adjusting it, saying that this issue was one of the most difficult to resolve in the history of Japanese diplomatic negotiations. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Statement by the Japanese Foreign Ministry Authorities</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Foreign Ministry issued a statement regarding the abolition of the perpetual land lease system with Britain and the United States, saying that the content of the exchanged documents between Japan and Britain, and Japan and the United States is the same, and its main points are as follows: The perpetual land lease system will be terminated on April 1, Showa 17 (1942), without any guarantee. The perpetual land lease rights will be changed to ownership. The issue of tax exemption will be maintained until March 31, Showa 17 (1942), and claims that have been disputed and not collected will no longer be pursued. The current area of perpetual land lease is 146,000 tsubo (approximately 6 square feet per tsubo), of which 64,000 tsubo are leased by British people and 31,000 tsubo are leased by American people, totaling 95,000 tsubo. The government is now also negotiating with other countries to resolve the remaining leased lands, and is confident that these negotiations will also have satisfactory results like the negotiations with Britain and the United States, and that it will sweep away the remnants of the era of extraterritoriality.

<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Discusses Guaranteeing Human Rights</h3>
<p>National Health Insurance Law Passed</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives convened at 11:12 AM this morning, presenting a bill to revise the Lawyers Act and six other bills. After Kiyoshi Ikeda explained the reasons, they were referred to a committee. Next, Matajirō Koizumi and 45 other representatives jointly proposed a resolution to "construct a parliamentary library and representatives' offices," and Setsuzaburō Uchisaki explained the content, requesting the government to implement it. He also strongly advocated the necessity of constructing a press club for newspaper and communications reporters. Then, Jirō Hoshijima of the Seiyūkai Party took the floor, saying that if the government does not consider this expense, it can be said that the government verbally advocates constitutional politics but actually despises constitutional politics. The Speaker then asked for the opinion of the House. At this time, all the representatives stood up to express their approval, and thus this item was approved.</p>
<p>Next, Matajirō Koizumi and 55 other representatives jointly proposed a resolution "regarding the eradication of human rights violations." At this time, Kawataro Kawakami of the Social Masses Party proposed that the resolution on human rights violations by the small group of people in the Diet should also be discussed together, but it was rejected by a majority vote.</p>
<p>Then, the representative of the Minseitō Party explained the current situation of the resolution jointly proposed by the Seiyūkai, Minseitō, and Shōwakai parties, mentioning examples of police officers violating human rights and attacking bureaucratic self-righteousness. After the explanation was completed, the discussion began. Kanju Katō, the second awardee, spoke first, saying:</p>
<p>"To eradicate human rights violations and establish the political reasons guaranteed by the constitution is a fundamental problem. Is not the violent behavior of Minseitō representatives towards newspaper reporters a violation of human rights?" Katō then read out newspaper articles from that time. At this time, the representatives of the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties deliberately interfered, but Katō ignored them and continued, saying:</p>
<p>"The motive for submitting this bill is extremely impure, so I have no choice but to oppose it formally. However, I will certainly support the purpose of eradicating human rights violations. However, the representatives who submitted this bill are disregarding the issue of the violation of the human rights of the masses and are only submitting a resolution for events related to themselves, which is not appropriate. This bill should be withdrawn, revised once, and made into an authoritative resolution."</p>
<p>After Katō stepped down, Rinji Ōishi of the Seiyūkai Party took the floor and said:</p>
<p>"When the authorities crack down on the Communist Party or violent gangs, there are indeed cases of torture, but both of these are opposed by the people, so the majority of the people have not made it a problem. However, it is particularly inappropriate to have this violation of human rights in election violation cases."</p>
<p>After the discussion was completed, the Speaker asked for those in favor or against. At this time, all the representatives from the Social Masses Party and other second control room members withdrew from the chamber, and the bill was passed with a majority of affirmative votes. The time was 2:00 PM, and the Speaker announced a recess.</p>
<p>The meeting reconvened at 3:42 PM. Speaker Tomita first read out the imperial edict extending the Diet session. Next, the National Health Insurance Bill was presented. After the committee chairman reported, the discussion began. Yōdatsu Tanaka of the Tōhōkai Party took the floor and said:</p>
<p>"Today, drug prices are too expensive because pharmaceutical companies are making excessive profits. Why does the government not crack down on pharmaceutical companies and unify drug prices?"</p>
<p>Tanaka expressed opposition to the chairman's report and advocated maintaining the original bill. At this time, members of the Social Masses Party made a noisy uproar. Next, Yūki Takechi of the Minseitō Party took the floor, expressing support. However, Masakazu Miyake of the Social Masses Party opposed, saying:</p>
<p>"It is regrettable that this bill has been revised by the committee. The government should bear the responsibility for this. The government initially stated that it would defend the original bill to the death and would not hesitate to dissolve the Diet, but then succumbed to the lobbying of the medical association and came to this."</p>
<p>Miyake criticized the amendment and also exposed the scandals of the Minseitō Party during the deliberation of this bill. At the same time, he mentioned the incident of a Minseitō Party representative injuring a newspaper reporter. At this time, members of the Minseitō Party shouted angrily. Then, Azuma Matsunaga of the Minseitō Party proposed to end the discussion. Members of the small group shouted "Oppose, oppose!" However, after a vote by the members, the motion to end the discussion was approved with 173 votes in favor and 40 votes against. Next, a vote was held on the National Health Insurance Bill, and as a result, the revised bill reported by the committee chairman was passed with a majority of 178 votes to 28 votes. Other bills, such as the Health Center Law and the amended version of the Tuberculosis Prevention Law, were also approved by a majority vote. The meeting adjourned at 6:34 PM. (25th, Domei News)</p>

<h3>The Determination of the Tianjin Customs in Suppressing Smuggling</h3>
<p>Thorough Investigation of Illicit Goods in Various Shops; Agreement Reached with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on Modified Measures; Deadline for Shops to Pay Taxes on Smuggled Goods is End of Month</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The Tianjin Customs is determined to thoroughly investigate smuggling both inside and outside the city of Tianjin. Although encountering many difficulties in enforcement, customs officials have shown courage and responsibility, demonstrating a persistent spirit. Li Xing, the chief of the Road Transport Anti-Smuggling Office, recently went to Beijing to report to the Ministry of Finance on the recent situation of smuggling by Japanese nationals and to seek instructions. Before his return north, the measures for suppressing smuggling inside and outside the city are to be jointly handled by the Customs and the Road Transport Anti-Smuggling Office, with no temporary changes. Last week, in order to deter others by punishing a few, the Customs raided the well-established and highly regarded second-hand clothing stores, "Dun Qinglong" and "Rui Fuxiang," seizing a quantity of smuggled goods. Subsequently, a large amount of smuggled cloth and linen was found in the "Qian Xiangyi" store, another major merchant on the same street. The status and reputation of this store is only slightly lower than Dun Qinglong and the others. After the smuggled goods of these three major merchants were seized, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce intervened on their behalf, submitting shipping documents filled out by foreign merchants to prove that the goods were not directly smuggled. However, the Customs refused to return the goods on the grounds of lacking complete tax payment certificates, and intends to impose fines. At the same time, customs officials are preparing to search other shops, causing panic among the silk, cloth, yarn, fresh vegetables, seafood, and medicinal materials industries. This is because most of the goods purchased by various merchants come from commercial firms in a certain concession area that engage in so-called "special trade." If subjected to a thorough search, they would be unable to produce formal customs tax payment certificates. Therefore, they pleaded with the Chamber of Commerce to negotiate and stop the Customs from implementing this kind of measure. In recent days, the Chamber of Commerce has dispatched Wang Wenzao, director of the Commercial Affairs Department, Cao Zhujiu, a member of the Silk, Cloth, and Yarn Trade Association, and Wang Xiaoyan, a standing committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, to the Customs Tax Bureau to negotiate. Finally, on the afternoon of the 22nd, the Customs agreed to the Chamber of Commerce's request and reached a modified agreement. The Customs will cease conducting direct searches of various shops before the 31st of this month, allowing the Chamber of Commerce to supervise the shops to comply with the terms of the agreement. At 3:30 PM on the 22nd, the Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of the heads of the 19 trade associations, including silk, cloth, yarn, weaving and dyeing, foreign goods, oil paint, pigment, western medicine, soap, cosmetics, and porcelain, and jointly decided on the following: ① The trade associations will notify their member shops to report the quantity, type, and category of smuggled goods purchased from foreign merchants to the Chamber of Commerce for a comprehensive registration. Before March 31st, the reports will be submitted to the Customs. After approval, taxes will be paid according to regulations. Past purchases will not be investigated. ② If the Customs believes that the reports are inaccurate or that there are concealed circumstances, it may notify the Chamber of Commerce. The trade associations will assist in spot checks to avoid direct confiscation of goods and the occurrence of disputes. The smuggled goods of "Dun Qinglong," "Rui Fuxiang," and "Qian Xiangyi" that have already been confiscated will be confiscated according to regulations and will not be returned for tax payment. Past offenses will not be investigated, and additional penalties will be imposed. The meeting adjourned at approximately 5:00 PM. Starting from the 23rd, the Customs has temporarily suspended search operations in the city in accordance with the agreement. According to the Customs, if the measures implemented this time are effective, they will then consult with the authorities in the various concession areas after completing the work in the Chinese area to promote this initiative in the shops within the concessions. Although it is clearly known that a certain concession area will absolutely not agree, it is hoped that at a minimum, other concession areas will provide assistance. If successfully implemented, the smuggling base in North China, with the exception of the bogus East Hebei Autonomous Anti-Communist Council, will be completely eliminated. As for a certain party's opposition to the Customs' actions, that is to be expected. However, because the area where the Customs is enforcing is the Chinese area, and those being searched are Chinese merchants, even if they are extremely unhappy, they have no opportunity to speak out.

<h3>The Guangmei Railway is About to Start Construction</h3>
<p>Route Length is 350 Kilometers; Construction Cost Estimated at 8 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The Guangzhou-Meixian Railway is the central part of the railway network of the three provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong. After the route was reviewed and determined by the Technology Office of the Ministry of Railways, Liu Shian, a technician from the Ministry of Railways, also led a team south to survey the route, dividing it into six sections for surveying. At the end of last month, the entire line was surveyed. It starts from the Shitang Station of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, passing through Huiyang, Zijin, Longchuan, Wuhua, Xingning, and reaching Meixian City, with a total length of 350 kilometers. The roadbed is prepared for future double-tracking. The entire road is contracted out in sections, and the actual construction cost is 8 million yuan. The materials required for bridges, culverts, and stone works will be estimated separately at that time. It is expected to be completed within two years. Half of the construction cost of the road will be allocated by the central government, and the other half will be raised by the Guangdong government, which will add a tax of 50 cents per picul to the Guangdong salt, all of which will be allocated to the road construction fee. The salt tax has already started to be levied on March 15th. All salt merchants in Guangdong and Guangxi have received a joint order to add 50 cents to each picul of salt, whether it is in storage or on the way, whether the tax has been paid or not. The method of raising funds must be strictly implemented and must not be changed. Liang Yonghuai, the director of the road construction preparation office, inspected the route with English consultant Sterling last month and selected the Aigang on Beifengang and Wusigui in Meicheng as the Meixian terminal. The survey team is stationed in Meicheng and is now divided into five teams to survey the branch line passing through Fengshun to Chaoan in order to connect with the Chaoshan Railway. It has been found that the 30-year patent period of the Chaoshan Road has expired, and it will definitely be taken back by the government in the future as a section of the Guangmei branch line going out to sea. Another team of surveyors set off from Jiaoling and Wuping to enter Fujian, passing through Yongding to Longyan. This line is a direct line to Zhangzhou and Xiamen, and its location is also very important.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province's Economy Improves; Export Surplus of Over 5 Million Last Year</h3>
<p>Breaks Years of Import Surplus</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Jiangxi has fertile land and abundant products. Foreign trade is often in a surplus. According to statistics from the Jiujiang Customs, from the 30th year of Guangxu to the 16th year of the Republic of China, there were only seven years of import surplus. The year with the largest import surplus, the 10th year of the Republic of China, was only 6,214,371 taels. Since the 17th year of the Republic of China, banditry has spread throughout the province, and the production mechanism has been completely destroyed. Foreign aggression is like entering a no-man's land. By the 20th year of the Republic of China, the import surplus was 22,600,9270 customs taels. Even in the 24th year, direct foreign trade exports were only 915 taels, and imports were 4,046,914 taels, reflecting the complete bankruptcy of Jiangxi's economy. By the 25th year, banditry in various places had been suppressed, agricultural production had a bumper harvest, and rural areas gradually regained vitality. In addition, the legal tender was consolidated, the exchange rate was stable, and exports were selling well. Local specialties, such as rice, porcelain, tungsten, wood, tea, paper, oil, ramie cloth, and agricultural by-products, have all increased by one to two times compared with before. According to statistics from the Jiujiang Customs, the province's import and export trade last year both increased compared with before, with an export surplus of more than 5 million yuan. Exports are mainly porcelain, rice, and tungsten, while imports are mainly cloth, tobacco, kerosene, hardware, handicrafts, cosmetics, and sugar.</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Self-Supplied Water Source Determined</p>
<p>The issue of establishing a self-supplied water system in Suzhou is being actively pursued by both officials and the public. The source of funding, whether to issue public bonds or borrow from a banking syndicate, is still under consideration. It has been decided to use the land price tax in the urban area as collateral. It has also been decided to take water from Yangcheng Lake outside Fengloumen as the water source. A professor from the Chemistry Department of Soochow University has been hired to test the water quality.</p>
<p>Xuan Sheng Case Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ribashi Xuan Sheng case was appealed to the High Court in Suzhou after the Shanghai District Court made a judgment. After several trials, it opened again yesterday (25th) at 2 PM. None of the five witnesses summoned appeared in court. Judge Ouyang Zhongqing (the original trial judge in this case, Zhou Dashou, has been transferred to the president of Fengxian District Court) questioned them for a long time. The case was not concluded because it was stated that the witnesses would need to be summoned for further investigation. The defendant was ordered to be remanded in custody pending further interrogation.</p>
<p>County Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee Meeting</p>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce convened an executive committee meeting on the 25th, chaired by Cheng Ganqing, and decided on the following: ① To send Cheng Ganqing and Liu Genhua as representatives to express condolences to the military police officer Wang Youmin, who was injured in the arrest of thieves. ② To submit a request to the County Party Department to convene people from all walks of life to launch a memorial service for the military police officer Wu Peng, who died in the arrest of thieves, in order to comfort his heroic spirit. ③ To request a temporary postponement of the land price tax and to hand it over to the Tax Regulations Committee for handling.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Japanese Navy Tours Battle Sites</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Naval Landing Force, Takeda, led 18 officers of the force, accompanied by Liang, the director of the Shanghai North Railway Station Police Bureau, and police officers in 11 cars from Shanghai via Dachang, Luodian, Liuhua, to Taicang to visit the sites of the January 28th Incident. At 12:30 PM, they returned to the city through the west gate, passing through Huancheng Road to the east gate, and then returned to the west gate to get off. The county government had been notified in advance by the Shanghai Police Bureau and assigned police officers to protect them from the car station outside the west gate as they entered the city. After lunch at Wujiaguan, they briefly toured the city and returned to Shanghai in their original cars via Nanxiang at around 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Heavy Snow Damages Crops</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, there has been continuous rain, making it difficult to cultivate and fertilize crops such as wheat, vegetables, and broad beans. The growing conditions were already very poor. Now, at the peak of spring crop development, the temperature suddenly dropped yesterday, equivalent to mid-winter. At noon, there was a light rain of snow beads, and heavy snow fell in the evening, accumulating several inches in the fields. The crops have suffered major damage again, and farmers are sighing incessantly.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Rice Market Prices Rise</p>
<p>Since the abolition of the lunar calendar and the new year, the price of rice in this county has been sluggish due to weak actual sales and low market sentiment. In the past ten days, the weather has turned cold, and the goods are prone to heating up, so hoarders are eager to sell, which makes the rice market even more depressed. However, sales have gradually picked up recently, and merchants' sentiment has turned firm, and market prices have also rebounded. This is because spring famine has occurred in Sichuan and Guangdong provinces, and rice sales have seen improvement. In addition, the weather has turned cold with rain and snow in recent days, and agricultural crops have been greatly affected. The rice market has also rebounded as a result, with a rise of four cents, and further increases are expected.</p>
<p>Request to Postpone Land Price Tax</p>
<p>The Provincial Land Administration Bureau decided to levy land price tax in Wuxi. The estimated price is 100 to 160 times higher than the original land price tax, which is difficult for the people to bear. The Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of various public legal entities and people from all walks of life to discuss the matter. They immediately elected Qian Sunqing, Li Tiping, Zhang Jichang, and ten others to form a land price research committee. Yesterday, the committee held its first research meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce and resolved that the County Chamber of Commerce, the Lawyers Association, the Education Association, the Farmers Association, the Labor Union, the County Property Management Office, the First District Office, the Physicians Association, the Newspaper Reporters Association, and local people will jointly telegraph a request to postpone the land price tax and strictly prohibit the loan interest to relieve the people's difficulties.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Opening Up East-West Main Roads</p>
<p>The county government is building a north-south main road, starting from the south gate and ending at the north gate, uniformly widening it to 10 meters. Since construction began, it has been nearly two months, and the demolition of houses is nearing completion. Personnel are now working on the road construction project. After this road is completed, the county government decided to continue to open up the east-west main road, starting from the Shanxi Gate and passing through Siqian Street, the city center, the Vinegar Warehouse Bridge, and the New County Front, to reach the Great East Gate, so that it can connect with Hupu in the future, connect with the Xihu Road in the east, and connect with the Huanshan Road in the west. This road project will start in early September.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Thunderstorms Followed by Snowstorms</p>
<p>In Yangzhou City, thunder and lightning struck around 8:00 AM on the 23rd, blasting the electric meter of the Xinghua Factory and injuring two factory workers. Unexpectedly, a strong wind roared like mid-winter at night, with flying stones and sand, and the situation was very serious. Around 10:00 AM on the 24th, snow suddenly began to fall, and it became heavier at noon, continuing all night. The snow depth was a foot thick in deep places and four or five inches in shallow places. It is said that many boats anchored on the lake and river were blown away and lost in the wind and snow. Countless walls and houses collapsed, and old trees were uprooted in the countryside. Fortunately, there were few casualties of people and animals.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Agricultural Bank Continues to Issue Subsidiary Currency Notes</p>
<p>The new subsidiary currency notes issued by the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank amounted to approximately 2 million yuan, but because the northern Jiangsu counties needed them greatly, the market finance relied on them to circulate, so the bank plans to continue to issue the remaining 1 million yuan. It is said that printing and other procedures are currently being handled, and they will soon be available on the market.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Puhui Bridge Rice Shop Robbed</p>
<p>Hedong, Puhui Bridge, outside the north gate is a prosperous commercial area. At about 8:00 PM on the 24th, when it was snowing heavily, Li Tianyu Rice Shop had already closed its accounts and closed for the day. Suddenly, four robbers came with pistols and knives, tied up the shop assistants, cut the telephone line, and robbed all the legal tender of 172 yuan, subsidiary currency notes of 5 yuan and 40 cents, and 112 small foreign coins in the silver box. Afterwards, the nearby police station and the joint military and police defense office were reported, and they searched inside and outside the city. At about 10:00 PM, a suspect was caught in the Zhou Yilai Inn on Dongwei Shore.</p>
<p>Abnormal Weather, Spring Snow Falls</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, there has been more rain and less sunny days. In addition, the weather has been abnormal, and epidemics are prevalent, such as meningitis, diphtheria, and smallpox. The wheat seedlings in the fields have already withered, and there is no hope for a small harvest. Unexpectedly, on the 24th, the weather turned cold, and heavy snow fell at noon, continuing late into the night, with snow accumulating to about three or four inches. All wheat seedlings and mulberry buds have been severely damaged.</p>
<h3>Funing</h3>
<p>Farmland Confiscated for Unpaid Taxes</p>
<p>The Xinong Company in this county has dozens of hectares of land, and has accumulated a large amount of unpaid taxes over the years, with no one responsible for paying them. The county government has reported this to the provincial government and received approval to seal up the company's land and confiscate it. It is also said that a part of it will be announced for bidding by the county.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Petition to Exempt from Building the Fengcai Road</p>
<p>The town road of Fengcai Road will be built in the area from Fengjie Bridge to Caijia Bridge in Jiaxing. However, local residents believe that the construction of the road will cause great losses to the people. Citizens Mei Jiying and others have expressed their opposition and petitioned the party and government authorities. On the 18th of this month, Zhu Yisheng, the director of the Construction Section of the County Government, convened a meeting of the relevant township chiefs in the Fengqiao District. The final result was to decide to build the road, and to narrow the road surface, not to demolish private houses, and to reduce the losses of the people. Unexpectedly, the township chiefs of various townships in the Fengqiao District, on the 24th, united with the township farmers' association staff Lu Benwen and Sheng Bai, along with dozens of villagers, and went to the County Farmers' Association, the County Party Department, and the County Government in the city to petition for exemption from building the Fengcai Road in order to avoid obstructing farmland. Secretary Ling of the county government replied that the road was decided upon by a joint meeting of various townships in the Fengshi District and submitted to the county for submission to the Construction Department for approval. It was not a private decision of the county government. The request for exemption from construction must be requested from County Chief Wang before a decision can be made.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Qiantang River Traffic Resumed Yesterday</p>
<p>The Qiantang River is an important channel for travel between eastern and western Zhejiang. Due to continuous rain in recent days, the upstream water level has risen sharply, flowing downstream very rapidly. On the 24th, the northeast wind was strong, and the waves in the river center were extremely violent. Yidu boats and small steamers stopped operating from 12:40 PM, and the river was closed. Passengers transferring to the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway were stranded on both sides of the river. Fortunately, the weather cleared this morning (25th), and the wind was weaker. The Qiantang River Yidu resumed operation from 5:50 AM, and the steamer schedules were also normal. Traffic has returned to normal.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Grain Theft Case Solved</p>
<p>The township granary of the Jiaqing Township Office in Yindong reported the sudden theft of grain, amounting to more than 16,000 catties. After receiving the report, the county government believed that the amount of theft was very large and could not be accomplished by the strength of a few people in one night. Therefore, it secretly sent the chief inspector of the section Xu Zhengtang to lead a police officer to disguise themselves as actors and conduct a secret investigation in the township. They quickly found that Hu Zhemin, the clerk of the township, and others were highly suspected. Tang Aqin, the handyman of Zhongshan Elementary School attached to the township office, was summoned to the Panhuoqiao police station for questioning. Tang confessed what he saw, confirming that clerk Hu Zhemin had colluded with deputy township head Bi Haogang, Zhou Axiang, and Zhou Zigenchang to steal together on the sixth day of the eleventh lunar month last year. After Xu Zhengtang obtained the confession, he immediately sent police to arrest Hu Zhemin and others and send them to the county. After questioning, the county government believed that the criminals had committed the act of stealing while on duty, which was extremely illegal. The perpetrators were transferred to the District Court for punishment on the afternoon of the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Yuyao</h3>
<p>Organizing a Cooperative Yarn Factory</p>
<p>The Yuyao County Government believes that there are more than 600,000 mu of cotton fields in the county, producing more than 300,000 dan of raw cotton annually, which is sufficient for the needs of a large yarn factory with 100,000 spindles. In order to facilitate the promotion of improved cotton and to provide relief to unemployed workers and develop local production, it plans to organize a cooperative yarn factory in Yao to benefit people's livelihoods. The following measures have been drafted: ① The scale of the yarn factory will be temporarily limited to 10,000 fine yarn spindles and will be built on land purchased outside Houqingmen in the north city. ② The capital of the yarn factory will be temporarily set at 600,000 yuan, which will be subscribed by cotton farmers based on the amount of land planted with cotton. ③ The organization of the yarn factory will be operated in a cooperative manner in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law. ④ A preparatory office for the cooperative yarn factory will be organized first, and the funds will be determined separately. The county government has now submitted the draft measures to the Provincial Construction Department for approval.</p>

<h3>Tianjin and Shanghai Meet at Yiyuan for the Port Football Match</h3>
<p>Match Starts at 3:00 PM Today; Even Strength Makes the Outcome Unpredictable</p>
<p>The sixth Shanghai-Tianjin port football match will be played between the Shanghai and Tianjin teams at 3:00 PM today at the Yiyuan Garden on Albert Road. The Tianjin team has very even strength, and the forwards are particularly sharp. Shanghai people are very familiar with Huo Wei, Johnson, and Jones, and there is no need to introduce them. Both center-backs Davis and Bieri have represented Shanghai and attended the port matches in Tianjin. Zhang Xueyao, Tan Fuzhen, Jiang Lu, Sun Yongquan, and others have all performed in Shanghai, so the strength of the Tianjin team is well-known. The Shanghai team, riding the momentum of defeating Hong Kong, and under the guidance of veteran Gaskell, will surely be able to win by surprise. According to the history of the Shanghai-Tianjin matches, Tianjin has won three, Shanghai has won one, and there has been one draw. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<h3>Brief History of the Tianjin-Shanghai Port Football Match</h3>
<p>Starting This Year, Changed to Once a Year</p>
<p>Examining the past history of port football, it was usually a match between the Shanghai and Hong Kong teams. In 1928, the Tianjin West Union Football Club also sent a team to Shanghai to compete, establishing a football connection between Shanghai and Tianjin.</p>
<p>▲First Session</p>
<p>—1928—</p>
<p>Held on December 25, 1928, at the Shenguo Stadium on Jiaozhou Road. At that time, the Chinese players selected for the Shanghai team included Zhou Xianyan as goalkeeper, Feng Yunyou as right inner defender, Li Huitang as left inner forward, and Dai Linjing as center forward. The strength was very strong. Unexpectedly, Tianjin made a name for itself. Sun Sijing was the only Chinese player selected. What Shanghai fans liked to say was that Mao Lisheng's center forward was as solid as a rock, and the forwards of Bald Luo Bao, Shi Linjie, and Parker (Parker, who is now at the French firm) and Jie Hansheng were unparalleled. The first match ended in a 1-1 draw. On January 29, the decisive battle was fought again at Shenyuan. Shanghai conceded two goals first, and then won three consecutive goals. Tianjin then tied the score at 3-3. Ma Shan'er broke through alone and took the lead again, thinking that victory was in sight. Unexpectedly, Tianjin's Shi Linjie immediately tied the score three minutes later. In the last three minutes, Tianjin's Wilson scored again, and won against Shanghai 5-4.</p>
<p>▲Second Session</p>
<p>—1930—</p>
<p>In 1930, the Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hong Kong teams fought at the same time in Shanghai. This was the beginning of the triangular cycle. It was held at Shenyuan and Yiyuan from February 1. Shanghai defeated Hong Kong 5-2 in the first match, and then defeated Tianjin 3-2. Shanghai still won the first championship. In the last match, Hong Kong also defeated Tianjin 3-2.</p>
<p>▲Third Session</p>
<p>—1933—</p>
<p>In 1931, it was another year off. Unexpectedly, the January 28th Shanghai Incident broke out in 1932. Shanghai suffered an unprecedented attack, and all sports activities were suspended. The Shanghai team had no time to go north to fulfill the agreement, so it was agreed that the third session would be held in Tianjin in 1933. Shanghai went to Tianjin for the match and lost badly by a score of 1-7. This was greatly criticized by the Chinese football community. The Shanghai Western Football Club thought that Tianjin was easy to deal with, so they filled the selection with unqualified players, which led to this defeat.</p>
<p>▲Fourth Session</p>
<p>—1934—</p>
<p>In the spring of 1934, the Tianjin, Hong Kong, and Shanghai teams played in Shanghai for the second time. The Tianjin team was very strong, but unexpectedly, Shanghai drew with them 3-3, and there was no rematch. The Hong Kong team lost to Shanghai 2-6 first, and then lost to Tianjin 2-4. The scale of their failure set an unprecedented record.</p>
<p>▲Fifth Session</p>
<p>—1936—</p>
<p>Last year (1936), it was held in Tianjin. The Shanghai team lost very regrettably. In the first half, Shanghai took the lead 2-1, and then took the lead 4-2. Unexpectedly, the Tianjin team scored six consecutive goals, leading to a 4-8 defeat. At last year's port banquet, the two teams decided to abolish the biennial tradition and change it to once a year. Therefore, the sixth session will continue to be held in Shanghai this year. Because last year's competition system resulted in a draw, there was almost no precedent to follow, so this year it has been stipulated that "if the match ends in a draw, it will be replayed for 90 minutes the next day. If the replay also ends in a draw, it will be extended for ten minutes each time (that is, switching sides every ten minutes). If there is still no winner in the extended time, the match will end in a draw." This new system was announced by the Western Football Club the day before yesterday, and it will be permanently set as an example from now on.</p>

<h3>Distinction Between Children's Reading Materials and Textbooks</h3>
<p>▲ Explanation from the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education approved the National Government's inquiry based on a submission by the Shanghai World Book Company of a "Primer for Elementary School Letter Writing," requesting registration. However, there were doubts about whether the book belonged to the scope of educational textbooks and whether it should follow the regulations of Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Copyright Law. Also, the Regulations for the Examination of Educational Textbooks did not specify that the insured should be the standard for the scope of educational textbooks. The Ministry of Education has replied to the Ministry of the Interior, stating that this type of book is a kind of children's reading material and is not within the scope of educational textbooks. However, the name and compilation are easily confused with educational textbooks. It is proposed that it be renamed "Children's Letter Writing" or "Practical Writing for Elementary School Students," and it is not appropriate to confuse the two. As for the scope of educational textbooks, the Ministry believes that all content edited according to the content stipulated by the Ministry's curriculum standards for various subjects in primary and secondary schools, divided into lessons or chapters, called readers, textbooks, or teaching materials, prepared for use as textbooks in various subjects in primary and secondary schools, taught in sequence, are all educational textbooks. Supplementary reading materials or reference books are not included in this scope. Corresponding reply for reference.</p>

<h3>Peiping China University Actively Raising Funds</h3>
<p>Peiping China University, formerly known as National University, was founded by Sun Yat-sen and the wise men of the Kuomintang. It was born in the first year of the Republic of China. Its history and the history of the Chinese Revolution have the same origin. However, due to repeated political changes and harsh environments, it was almost in danger. Fortunately, Dr. Wang Rutang succeeded the school in the midst of turbulent waves, spared no difficulty and danger, and tried his best to support it, so that it could barely survive. Later, Dr. Wang repeatedly appealed and received donations from enlightened people at home and abroad to purchase a school site and add a large-scale science department. The quality of management and the prosperity of talent training are developing rapidly. Only the lack of a fixed fund has caused many obstacles to its progress. It is now learned that the school is preparing to raise funds. It is heard that Minister Kong has donated 10,000 yuan, Committee Chairman Song Mingxuan of Peiping has donated 20,000 yuan, Chamber Chairman Qi Yu of Henan has donated 5,000 yuan, Chairman Han Xiangfang of Shandong has donated 1,000 yuan, and Consul General Yu Junji in New York has donated 3,000 US dollars. Other people at home and abroad, as well as graduates of the school, are also doing their best to raise funds. It is also heard that many of them have raised a considerable amount. It is believed that with the love and care of enlightened people at home and abroad, the fundraising results will be impressive this time.</p>

He said that he was very honored to attend and speak at this meeting. He had traveled to various European countries and felt that the thoughts and lives of Europeans and Americans were different. European philosophy is too materialistic, rigorous, and standardized. It pays great attention to rigorous training but does not pay attention to the people's free thought and action. American philosophy is different from European philosophy. The American people are a mixed new race. Their adventurous spirit in life is very rich. Although the school system is different in each state, the thinking is quite free and consistent. The people can enjoy democratic rights, local autonomy, freedom of speech and publication, and Christianized life, and they have great self-confidence and self-reliance. This is the characteristic of the American people.</p>

<h3>The Public Works Department's Plan to Add Primary Schools Cannot Be Implemented</h3>
<p>▲ Subsidizing American Schools by 100 Yuan</p>
<p>The Education Committee of the Public Works Department planned to purchase a piece of land at the intersection of Yulin Road and Dalianwan Road (more than nine and three-tenths mu), along with a three-story factory building and two bungalows located there, for the purpose of adding a Chinese primary school in the Eastern District and relocating the Western Girls' School. Although all the houses are old, they can be used after minor repairs. The original site of the Western Girls' School is adjacent to the land, and the lease of its houses and sports fields will expire in May and August of this year, respectively. At that time, they can be moved into the planned bungalows. The open space can be divided into two parts to serve as sports fields for the two schools, which is very convenient. The estimated cost is about 30,000 to 60,000 yuan. After careful consideration, the board of directors of the Public Works Department believes that the cost is too high and cannot be implemented given the current financial situation. In addition, at the last meeting, the Education Committee decided to submit a proposal to the board of directors, requesting approval to include an item for the construction cost of the classrooms of the Chinese primary school on Kennerly Road in this year's expenditure budget, totaling 7,400 yuan. The above proposal has been approved by the board of directors. In addition, the bureau has subsidized American schools by 10,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Letters from the College of Law and Politics and Others</h3>
<p>A letter from the Shanghai College of Law and Politics states: "Dear Editor, the news published in your newspaper on the 25th about the board of directors meeting of the College of Law and Politics contains discrepancies with the facts. The points that do not match the facts are listed in detail below, and we hope that you will correct them to clarify the facts: ㊀ The board of directors meeting of the College of Law and Politics was convened in the name of Dean Zhang, not at the request of the students. The invitation letters were sent before the expelled students petitioned. The invitation letters at the offices of the directors can prove this. ㊁ About fourteen or fifteen directors attended the board of directors meeting, which was a general meeting of the directors, not a standing committee of the board of directors. ㊂ Only seven students petitioned, five of whom were expelled by the school. The so-called 'School Protection Association' is purely a pretext to disrupt order. Moreover, the board of directors did not allow them to attend the meeting, as the records can prove. ㊃ There have been no strike actions in our college. Since the board of directors meeting, students have been attending classes more neatly. The so-called 'Shen Xinfu and others explained the great righteousness' is even more untrue. Moreover, since Shen Xinfu and others are expelled students, they have no reason to come to the school to dissuade students from striking. Your newspaper has always been fair in its attitude. We respectfully request that you publish the letter to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Shanghai College of Law and Politics, March 25th." Another letter from the School Protection Association of the College of Law and Politics states: "Dear Editor, since the board of directors meeting, classmate Zhang Yin and others have suddenly come out to attack us, and while we were surprised, students who signed their names to attack us have come to our association in an endless stream, even saying that they have various difficulties and are inconvenient to publish corrections. After the meeting, the association decided that those who have already openly opposed the authorities, such as Song Sirong and others, and those who have served as representatives of the association, such as Shen Xinfu and others, should not publish a statement. As for the purpose of the organization of this association, it is only to reorganize the unspeakable school affairs and has no other purpose. We hereby send this letter and request that you publish it. Sincerely, School Protection Association of the College of Law and Politics, March 25th."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Aviation Construction Association Adds an Air Defense Military Exhibition Room</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the press was invited to visit, and Li Dachao reported on the association's work.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai branch of the China Aviation Construction Association was reorganized from the China Aviation Association and continues its previous work. Last year, due to the intensive solicitation work for the aircraft donation for birthday celebration, the association's work did not progress. Recently, a committee meeting was held, and it was decided to first enrich the library and exhibition room to instill in the people knowledge of aviation and to organize members and expand the solicitation. The association specially invited the local press to visit the club in the city center yesterday and reported on the association's work, as recorded below.</p>
<p>Air Defense Exhibition: The association's new club is built next to the museum in the city center. The entire building is shaped like an airplane, which is very novel and unique. Inside, there is a library and exhibition room, which are open daily. Those who visit the museum will also visit it, which is very important for instilling knowledge of aviation. Recently, with the support of the Municipal Air Defense Association, an air defense exhibition room has been added. The reporter was invited to visit the room first, and Mr. Zhang Yuliang, an official of the association, explained it in detail, which was very exciting. The long tables around the room display many models of bomber and fighter planes from various countries, including Japanese military giant planes, which are said to be able to carry many kilograms of bombs, and their power can destroy the newest and strongest buildings. The large bombs are also suspended next to the table, reaching a height of one meter, which is frightening. In the center of the room is a large wooden platform with an air defense army company, including anti-aircraft guns, listening devices, searchlights, and other models, each with four units, all painted in protective colors such as yellow and green, and connected by electric wires. When an electric button is pressed, each machine rotates in the same direction, reportedly, the listening device and searchlight are used to detect enemy aircraft movements, and when the calculation instrument measures the accurate position, it is transmitted to the anti-aircraft guns to fire. The new type of machinery can hit eight out of ten shots, so the air defense effect is very large. In future international wars, such equipment is necessary to prevent air strikes. Countries are loudly calling for air defense facilities. After the visit, the reporter deeply felt the need for our country to prepare quickly. The room is now open to the public, every day (except Tuesday) from 9:00 to 12:00 in the morning and 1:00 to 5:00 in the afternoon, the public can freely enter and visit.</p>
<p>Tea Party Reception: A tea party was held in the auditorium, attended by many reporters from various newspapers. The general secretary of the association, Li Dachao, reported, stating briefly that the association has been established for many years and has now been reorganized, but the work has not been interrupted. In recent years, we have been very grateful for your assistance in publicity and advocacy of the aviation rescue movement. Today, we specially invite you to discuss and report on the association's work. The branch is organized by the Aviation Association. In the two or three solicitation movements, more than 100,000 members have joined, all of whom are members of the branch. Now it has been decided to organize and enrich the organization, and to continue to collect this year's membership fees, and to continue to solicit new members from the second half of the year. Since the association has received aircraft donations from various agencies in the city, the results have been very good. The association originally had a library, but because there are not many domestic aviation books, it plans to purchase more books on military affairs to give people the opportunity to study military affairs. An additional room has been added to the exhibition room to display air defense military equipment, which has been opened for exhibition. The Aviation Bi-Weekly, when published before, sold 5,000 to 6,000 copies, which was very popular. It has been decided to resume publication next month. The China Flying Club has now moved to Beijing, and the affiliated flight training class will continue to be held in Beijing, but there is no fixed term. The national aviation skills are trained anytime and anywhere. As for the aircraft purchase for birthday celebration promoted last year, the city raised 1 million yuan and purchased 10 aircraft. When naming them, it caused a sensation throughout the city. Currently, more than 860,000 yuan has been received, and the remaining amount will be collected and remitted to the general association within one month. The tea party ended around 4 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Oppose the Municipal Council's Tax Increase</h3>
<p>The First Special District Federation will hold an emergency meeting tomorrow; the Taxpaying Chinese Association will propose corrections in the meeting.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, although the Municipal Council Board of Directors' proposal to increase the general surcharge land tax was opposed by all circles and strongly argued by all Chinese directors, it was ultimately passed by a vote of six to five and will be submitted to the taxpayers' annual meeting for approval and implemented on July 1. All circles are deeply disturbed by this and are rising up to discuss countermeasures. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The First Special District Federation will hold a meeting tomorrow. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation issued a notice yesterday, which reads: "Dear Representatives, the Municipal Council Board of Directors, disregarding the difficult times, has actually passed a resolution to increase the general municipal surcharge to 16%. Our industrial and commercial circles and citizens of various districts cannot tolerate this. We have decided to convene a temporary emergency representative assembly at the club at 2 p.m. on March 27. We hope you will take the time to attend and discuss countermeasures. Sincerely, Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation."</p>
<p>Business Leaders Express Serious Concerns: According to a business leader who spoke to the Central News Agency, the Municipal Council Board of Directors' passed tax increase proposal cites the inability to balance revenue and expenditure as an excuse. However, everyone knows whether all the Municipal Council's expenses can be reduced. Today, the Municipal Council only knows how to maintain its own huge expenses and disregards the difficulties of the people. It does not know that the residents in the concession, in this world depression, are struggling to survive, but it is ultimately difficult to save this crisis. The municipal authorities should share the joys and sorrows. Otherwise, at a time when various industries are depressed, increasing the burden on the citizens will not only affect the prosperity of the entire city, but the Municipal Council's desire to increase revenue will inevitably backfire. Therefore, the business community believes that this is inappropriate for the sake of its own survival and for the Municipal Council's own maintenance.</p>
<p>The Taxpaying Chinese Association will correct it. According to a spokesman for the Taxpaying Chinese Association, the Municipal Council plans to increase the tax rate by 2%. If so, it can increase revenue by 2.5 million yuan per year, but this approach is like drinking poison to quench thirst. Moreover, the Municipal Council's recent measures often disregard the happiness and safety of the residents in the concession. In this session of the Taxpaying Chinese Association, all the Municipal Council's inappropriate measures will be put forward for correction.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bonds Principal Repayment Lottery Held Yesterday</h3>

<p>Chairman's Report: After the usual formalities, Chairman Xu Fu reported, stating briefly that the 13th principal repayment lottery for Shanghai Municipal Bonds was being held today, and he was very pleased that everyone was present to supervise.

<h3>Chang'an Steamer Sends Out SOS Signal in a Storm</h3>
<p>Lost its rudder machinery off the coast of Haizhou; China Merchants Bureau has dispatched a ship to rescue it.</p>
<p>Due to the large quantity of rice and flour being shipped from Shanghai to Xi'an by the state-run China Merchants Bureau to relieve the people's food shortage, the supply of ships was insufficient, so the company temporarily chartered the Da Peng and Chang'an steamers to carry grain to Laoyao for transfer to the Longhai Railway for transport to the Northwest. The Chang'an steamer, owned by Liji Steamer Company in this city and managed by Shou Kang Steamer Company, has a capacity of 1,492 tons, a length of 235 feet 2 inches, a width of 32 feet 7 inches, and a depth of 19 feet 8 inches, loaded with 2,000 tons of cargo. It departed Shanghai on the 23rd of this month, carrying 2,800 tons of rice and flour to Lianyungang. At 3 a.m. on the 25th, it was about 140 nautical miles north of Yushan, at 33 degrees 15 minutes north latitude and 122 degrees 35 minutes east longitude, when it encountered:</p>
<p>A strong storm: The sky was snowing heavily, and the waves were surging in the sea. The ship struggled in the storm, but the wind and waves became more and more fierce. At about 5 o'clock, the ship's rudder machinery was knocked into the sea by a big wave. The ship lost its rudder and could not sail. It immediately dropped its main anchor into the sea and sent out an SOS signal for help. The Shanghai coastal radio station received this warning and immediately notified Shou Kang Company and the China Merchants Bureau to prepare for rescue. Upon receiving the report, the bureau immediately telegraphed the Hairui steamer, which was en route, to:</p>
<p>Rush to the rescue: Shou Kang Steamer Company also informed the insurance companies. It is said that the cargo on board is insured for more than 200,000 yuan under peace insurance, and the hull of the Chang'an steamer is also insured for 200,000 yuan. Upon receiving the news, Mr. Tang Danhua, the director of the China Shipping Insurance Joint Association, discussed rescue methods. At 2 p.m., it was decided to send the Kistler Muller, a large tugboat from the Zhaishi Foreign Company, to the site of the Chang'an accident to tow the ship to safety. This place is not far from Lianyungang and will soon be towed to Laoyao. Yesterday afternoon, the weather gradually improved, and the wind and waves subsided. The Chang'an steamer may be safe and sound and rescued.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Tax-Exempt Foreign Rice to be Shipped to Guangdong; Grain Industry Asks Central Government to Stop It</h3>
<p>Early rice in the South is approaching harvest, and there is no food shortage; Moreover, neighboring provinces are supplying food, so why seek it from abroad?</p>
<p>The Grain Industry Association and the Bean and Rice Industry Association of this city telegraphed the central government yesterday, requesting that the request from Guangdong Province for tax exemption on imported foreign rice not be approved in order to maintain agriculture and commerce and prevent loopholes. The original telegram reads: "To Jiang, President of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, and Kong, Minister of Finance: It is said that Guangdong Province previously feared a shortage of grain and requested that foreign rice be imported tax-free. The Executive Yuan (most likely) adheres to its consistent policy of complete opening of taxes and rural areas and did not approve it. Recently, news has spread that 2 million dan of tax-exempt foreign rice and foreign grain will be transported to Guangdong, which is causing quite a stir. Since last winter, various producing areas have been shipping food to Guangdong to meet the demand, taking advantage of the abundant harvests of last autumn, so the current food reserves are quite sufficient. In addition, there are currently about 100,000 dan of rice waiting to be shipped to Guangdong from Shanghai, and the amount of surplus grain transferred from Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei is even greater. Moreover, the early rice in the South is approaching harvest, and there is no food shortage, so why seek it from abroad? The emergence of this rumor has suddenly caused suspicion in the marketplace, and merchants are hesitant, and grain transportation is not progressing. If this continues until the time when the old and new crops are not yet available, we will again suffer from a shortage, and the sales of surplus grain in neighboring areas will be blocked, which will have a huge impact. I believe that you, with your foresight and insight, will be able to prevent problems before they arise. We earnestly hope that you will quickly issue a statement to clarify this rumor to the people and maintain your consistent policy. We are extremely anxious. Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association and Grain, Oilcake Industry Association, respectfully."</p>

<p>New Yu Second Factory</p>
<h3>Conflict Arising from Dismissal of Workers Leaves Over Twenty Injured</h3>
<p>Workers Petitioned Party and Government Organs Yesterday, Social Bureau Scheduled to Convene Mediation This Morning</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, a conflict erupted between staff and workers at the New Yu No. 2 Cotton Mill in western Shanghai due to the dismissal of workers, resulting in over ten injuries on both sides. Workers petitioned party and government organs, and the Social Bureau has scheduled mediation for this morning. Detailed information is as follows:</p>
<p>Dismissed Workers Refuse Entry to Factory: The New Yu No. 2 Cotton Mill at 8 Robison Road in western Shanghai has over 1,900 male and female workers. The factory suddenly issued a notice the night before last, dismissing 56 workers including Xu Peijin from various departments without stating any reason. When the night shift workers arrived at the factory, the factory refused entry to all those dismissed. By 9:30 PM the night before last, workers who had already entered the factory were also expelled, with the factory claiming it was about to shut down.</p>
<p>Staff Open Fire, Fortunately No One Injured: At 6:00 AM yesterday morning, day shift workers entered the factory as usual, but were stopped by detectives dispatched by the Putuo Road Police Station. They were told that the factory intended to replace the machinery and was temporarily announcing a shutdown. At this point, all the workers crowded into the accounting room to negotiate, demanding immediate resumption of work. Wang Nenghua, head of the personnel department, Fu Hansheng, a weaving engineer, He Da, a spinning engineer, and Yu Yinchun, a weaving clerk, each drew their self-defense pistols and fired two shots, fortunately without injuring anyone.</p>
<p>Scalding Water Causes Severe Injuries to Three: The workers were enraged by the factory's use of firearms to intimidate them, and due to the large number of people and loud voices, the factory, seeing no way to disperse them, poured boiling water on the workers. Zhu A'san, Zhu A'da, Yao Yonghe, and others suffered severe burns to their heads, faces, hands, and feet, with blisters forming, while over twenty others suffered minor injuries. The workers rushed forward and seized Wang Longhua's pistol. Upon hearing the news, the police station dispatched a reserve team in police vehicles to suppress the situation, and the workers were finally dispersed.</p>
<p>Four Staff Members Also Injured: During the conflict, the order was chaotic. After the staff's pistols were seized, some of the workers beat the staff. Xu Yuanbin, the 37-year-old Jiangsu native section chief of the yarn department, was injured internally; Fu Hansheng, the 31-year-old Sichuan native weaving engineer, was injured in the head; He Da, the 31-year-old Yunnan native spinning engineer, was injured in the face and legs. Another staff member was also injured on the head and face when the factory poured boiling water on the workers.</p>
<p>Arrested Workers Immediately Released: The workers were furious because the factory's actions were unreasonable and they opened fire and injured people. At around 10:00 AM, factory security officer Fang Debiao suffered a head injury, claiming he was beaten by the workers, but the workers claimed he fell himself. The detective arrested Wang Jigu, an oiling worker, and sent him to the Putuo Road Police Station for detention. After questioning him until 12:00 PM and determining he was not involved, he was released.</p>
<p>Petitions to Party and Government Organs: After the incident, the workers immediately selected representatives Xu Peijin, Wang Zhengbiao, Zhou A'da, and Xu A'mao at 9:00 AM, carrying a seized pistol and two bullet casings, to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters. They were received by Lu Yinchu of the Civil Affairs Department, who promised to convene mediation and transferred the pistol to the Garrison Headquarters for research. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, Wang Zhengbiao, Xu A'mao, and Zhou A'da were sent to the Social Bureau to petition, where they were received by Xu Yefu, the section chief of the Third Section, who promised to mediate and investigate, and advised the workers to maintain order.</p>
<p>Injured Sent to Hospitals for Treatment: Workers with minor injuries bandaged themselves and rested. Zhu A'er, Zhu A'da, and Yao Yonghe, who were seriously injured, were sent by car to the Labor Hospital at 1000 Xiaochaodu Road at 2:00 PM in the afternoon for examination and treatment. Factory staff Xu Yuanbin, Fu Hansheng, He Da, and the other staff member burned by water, a total of four people, were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Authorities Convene Mediation This Morning: The Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau, based on the workers' petition report, considered the situation serious, so the Social Bureau has scheduled a meeting at 9:00 AM this morning at the bureau to convene responsible representatives from both sides for mediation. The shooting incident will also be thoroughly investigated by officials today. In addition to sending the pistol cartridges to the Garrison Headquarters for research, the Municipal Party Headquarters decided to send personnel to investigate the truth in order to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Both Labor and Management Have Made Statements: According to the factory, the workers were armed with iron rulers and wooden sticks, smashing equipment, cutting telephone lines, and beating staff. Fortunately, the engine room was locked, preventing further damage. The total loss is estimated to be over 10,000 yuan. However, according to the workers, the workers demanded to resume work, which was a legitimate request. The factory dismissed workers without reason and refused them entry. The workers, for the sake of their livelihoods, made reasonable demands, but were met with gunfire and boiling water. The workers, for self-defense, fought back with a few of them. The factory should be responsible for this dispute.</p>
<p>Idle Work at First Factory Stopped by Persuasion: Over 1,000 workers at the New Yu No. 1 Factory at 37 West Suzhou Road, dissatisfied with the factory's dismissal of workers at the No. 2 Factory without reason, and the shooting and scalding of workers, declared a slowdown in response at 8:00 PM last night. Upon hearing the news, the Gordon Road Police Station dispatched a large number of detectives to suppress the situation and persuaded the workers to resume work at 8:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Labor Strike Erupts at Meyer No. 10 Factory This Morning</h3>
<p>Workers at the Meyer Silk Weaving Company No. 10 Factory in Zhabei previously launched a labor strike over demands for improved treatment. After mediation by party and government organs, work was resumed on the 18th. However, this morning, due to the factory calling the police and arresting workers, disturbances erupted again, resulting in injuries to a police chief and a police officer. Over ten workers were arrested one after another. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Workers Arrested: At around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the Zhicheng Silk Weaving Factory (i.e., Meyer No. 10 Factory) at 1077 Guanghan Road in Zhabei reported to the Baziqiao Sub-Police Station that workers were inciting a labor strike and requested police protection. The police dispatched officers to arrest worker Lü Xichun (a 27-year-old Shaoxing native), who was briefly interrogated and transferred to the North Station Branch Bureau for further investigation. Afterwards, the workers believed that the arrest of Lü was instigated by worker Pan Fengshao (a 30-year-old Xinchang native). At around 11:00 AM, they gathered dozens of people and waited for Pan outside the factory gate, confronting him with questions. A verbal conflict ensued, and Pan was beaten and injured. The police rushed to the scene and arrested the assailant Wang Fengtang (a 23-year-old Xinchang native), who is currently under investigation. While this was happening, the police station received a request from police officer Wang Zijie of the factory, stating that over a hundred male and female workers had gathered in front of the factory with the intention of causing disturbances and requesting protection.</p>
<p>Police Chief Assaulted: Upon receiving the report, Inspector Hong Wenxin led a large number of uniformed police officers to suppress the situation. The crowd was noisy, and disturbances suddenly erupted. In the chaos, police chief Yuan Hechai and police officer Shi Xizeng were beaten on the head and face, with skin broken and blood flowing. The police then arrested nineteen male and female workers: Tu Yunyue (a 24-year-old Shaoxing native), Wang Boyin (a 30-year-old Hangzhou native), Zhou Shanzhi (a 21-year-old Hangzhou native), Qian Hanxiang (a 24-year-old Hangzhou native), Ge Shiyuan (a 33-year-old Jinhua native), Sun Juemin (a 23-year-old Shaoxing native), Sun Gaoqing (a 35-year-old Shaoxing native), Qiu Xiaohua (a 23-year-old Shaoxing native), Tao Xilin (a 22-year-old Huzhou native), Zhou Miaoying (a 21-year-old Shaoxing native), Shang Xinzhu (a 26-year-old Shaoxing native), Yuan Guoyuan (a 21-year-old Xinchang native), Yuan Guoyi (a 24-year-old Xinchang native), Ma Tongwen (a 29-year-old Xinchang native), Zhang Jinbao (a 20-year-old Nanjing native), Wang Zixiang (an 18-year-old Shaoxing native), Wang Jisong (a 25-year-old Shaoxing native), Yang Jinxing (a 23-year-old Shaoxing native), and Wang Baiquan (a 19-year-old Shaoxing native). All nineteen were taken to the North Station Branch Bureau for temporary detention pending interrogation.</p>
<p>Workers Released on Bail: After the workers were arrested, fearing that the labor strike would be reignited, the Social Bureau, after receiving information, sent Wang Zhusun to investigate and persuade the workers. Union cadre Di Jieke also went to visit. The detained workers were all released on bail by the union that evening.</p>
<h3>Xie Kang Rubber Factory Workers Petitioned Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Xie Kang Rubber Factory on Xietu Branch Road in the South City, which has been in operation for many years under manager Yuan Bingyuan, was once suspended last year, and resumed operations on December 1st. However, on March 22nd, it suddenly closed down without prior announcement. Workers were only notified at the end of work on the 21st that they would be one hour late for work on the 22nd. The workers did not suspect anything at the time. However, when they arrived for work the next morning, the factory gate was locked and a notice was posted, stating that attorney Zhang Guangyao and accountant Chen Luanqing had been appointed to represent the factory in declaring liquidation. The entire workforce was shocked and at a loss. Unpaid wages and deposits had not been calculated, and work tools were also locked inside. They immediately petitioned the district union for relief. Yesterday, over 200 male and female workers from the factory, including Zhang Genyu, Liu Xiaogui, Gong Baosheng, Tang Jinfeng, and Zhu Zhaodi, went to the Municipal Social Bureau to petition at 9:00 AM. They were received by Zhang Chuqiang, who promised to provide assistance according to the law. The district union, considering the incident extraordinary, also sent representatives Chu Chengdong and Yuan Zhaoxin with letters to the lawyers and accountants yesterday afternoon for serious negotiations.</p>
<h3>German Consul-General Krieba Left for Home Last Night</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Budget for 1937</h3>
<p>Audited and Approved by the Board of Directors, Submitted to the Ratepayers' Annual Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council budget for 1937 was submitted to the Council's Finance Committee for review on the 21st of this month. According to the report of the Chief Financial Officer, the estimated recurrent revenue for this year, after offsetting the accumulated deficit of 738,720 yuan from the previous year, is expected to have a surplus of 11,437,080 yuan, a decrease of 410,660 yuan compared to the total revenue of the previous year. The estimated 24,371,080 yuan includes the increased revenue expected from the increased property tax and land tax from July 1st. The Chief Financial Officer believes this tax increase plan is necessary. The amount of additional revenue that can be collected after the tax increase is 1,258,000 yuan, which is still insufficient to balance the budget, so a large sum must still be drawn from the general reserve fund. The estimated revenue from land tax, property tax in the outer road area, rent from Council properties, and wharf dues after the tax increase are 494,000 yuan, 700,000 yuan, 95,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, and 1,000,000 yuan, respectively, all higher than the budgeted amounts for the previous year. However, license fees (estimated revenue of 97,100 yuan), revenue from public and municipal utilities (estimated revenue of 27,360 yuan), and miscellaneous revenue (estimated revenue of 671,600 yuan) are all less than the budgeted amounts for the previous year. Furthermore, the previous year's budget included accumulated surplus from the previous year, while this year's budget must offset the previous year's deficit, so the increased revenue from the various taxes is offset accordingly. Recurrent expenditure (including ordinary municipal expenditure and education expenditure) totals 26,197,300 yuan, a decrease of 567,560 yuan compared to the previous year. Expenditure in all departments has been tightened as much as possible within the possible range. Staff salaries have been reduced according to the recommendations of the Staff Economic Committee, but the revenue and expenditure are still short by 1,826,220 yuan. Therefore, it is proposed to draw 1,850,000 yuan from the general reserve fund. This amount, after offsetting the above deficit, will still leave a surplus of 13,780 yuan.</p>
<p>(Special Revenue and Expenditure): Special revenue is estimated at 24,397,000 yuan, including 10,891,610 yuan drawn from the reserve fund to repay the 1925 and 1927 public bonds. Special expenditure is estimated at 24,386,930 yuan, leaving a surplus of 10,070 yuan after offsetting revenue and expenditure.</p>
<p>(Taxes): Various tax rates are proposed to be increased this year, as detailed below:</p>
<p>A. Land Tax: From January 1st to June 30th of this year, the tax rate is 7 per mille. From July 1st to the opening of the next Ratepayers' Annual Meeting, the tax rate is 8 per mille. All land within the International Settlement is subject to tax based on price, payable by tenants in advance every six months.</p>
<p>B. Property Tax: From January 1st to June 30th of this year, the tax rate is 14 percent. From July 1st to the opening of the next Ratepayers' Annual Meeting, the tax rate is 16 percent. All properties within the International Settlement are subject to tax based on the estimated rental value, payable by residents in advance every quarter.</p>
<p>C. Special Property Tax: From January 1st to June 30th of this year, the tax rate is 12 percent. From July 1st to the opening of the next Ratepayers' Annual Meeting, the tax rate is 14 percent. All properties outside the International Settlement whose residents enjoy the benefits of various facilities within the International Settlement (including public utilities) are subject to tax based on the estimated rental value, payable by residents in advance every quarter.</p>
<p>The case of increasing property and land taxes has caused much debate. A brief account of the discussion is as follows: One committee member advocated postponing the implementation of the tax increase plan by one year. The reasons given were that various industries have been in decline for a long time, but are currently turning around. Implementing the tax increase would inevitably arouse strong opposition from all sectors of the Chinese community.</p>
<p>The Chief Financial Officer stated that the estimated tax revenue in the budget has been estimated to the most accurate extent. Even after the tax increase (estimated to increase revenue by over 1.25 million yuan), the Shanghai Municipal Council's finances will still be difficult.</p>
<p>The committee member also stated that according to information he had obtained, the Council's tax revenue in the first half of 1936 had indeed decreased, but had recovered in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>The Chief Financial Officer stated that it was easier to collect taxes in the second half of last year, but this was unrelated to the total amount collected.</p>
<p>The Chairman explained the financial difficulties, saying that rents in various places had been reduced by as much as 30 percent. Since rents have been reduced, it will be impossible to make ends meet without increasing the tax rate. He asked the committee members to note that the Council's budget has not been balanced by regular methods for several years since 1929. If the tax increase is not implemented now, it will be necessary to increase the tax by 4 percent next year to make up for the deficit. Therefore, efforts should be made to remedy the situation now to avoid even greater difficulties in the future.</p>
<p>The Chief Financial Officer explained that even if the tax increase is implemented from July 1st, there will be no possibility of improving municipal facilities in the coming year, whether in social services or other areas. To balance the budget, it is necessary to draw over 1.8 million yuan from the reserve fund.</p>
<p>The Chairman also stated that residents who pay 10 yuan in rent per month will only have their burden increased by a dime. Those who pay more rent will be burdened accordingly. The Council cannot fail to balance the budget due to this increase. If no remedy is sought now, how will residents react when the tax is increased to 18 percent next year?</p>
<p>One committee member stated that most of the taxes are paid by the Chinese, so their opinions must be seriously considered. Implementing the tax increase may arouse fierce opposition from the Chinese. As for balancing the budget, it can be achieved by other means. He believed that the Council's expenditure can still be reduced significantly. The Chairman stated that many people in all sectors of society have already criticized the Shanghai Municipal Council, saying that the Council is overly tightening expenditure on municipal facilities, causing inconvenience to residents. It is unfounded for the Chinese to say that expenditure in this area can still be reduced.</p>
<p>The Chief Financial Officer explained to the committee members that expenditure in all departments has already been economized. For example, the amount stated in the Public Works Department's budget is the smallest since 1932. Society is gradually prospering, and it is necessary to balance the budget by regular methods. As for the reserve fund, it can only be used to make up for future deficits and support financial progress.</p>
<p>One committee member continued, stating that the Council had once planned to increase taxes, and he advocated reducing expenditure first. Since the adoption of this proposal and the implementation of layoffs and salary reductions, Chinese residents have praised it highly. In the past decade, property tax revenue has increased year by year, except for 1936. Last year's business depression resulted in lower revenue, but tax collection performance gradually improved by the end of the year, and is expected to improve further this year.</p>
<p>The Chief Financial Officer stated that even if an additional 100,000 or 200,000 yuan could be collected, it would not help much.</p>
<p>The Chairman stated that no matter how much tax collection performance improves, it will not be possible to make up for the deficit of approximately 3 million yuan. The Council's reserve fund has been gradually used, and the Council's financial foundation will be unstable if this continues.</p>
<p>One committee member advocated implementing the tax increase next year if this year's revenue does not increase. The Chairman said that the Council's expenditure has exceeded revenue for five years. Without using the reserve fund, it would be impossible to support the budget. Therefore, the tax increase cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>The committee member also raised a question, saying that the Council's expenditure exceeds revenue every year. Should these expenditures be restricted? He reiterated that most of the taxpayers are Chinese residents, and this issue should be handled with caution and not rushed.</p>
<p>One committee member stated that the Council's finances are different from a store's finances, and there is absolutely no need to accumulate a reserve fund.</p>
<p>The Chief Financial Officer explained that the so-called reserve fund is the revenue from the sale of the Electricity Department, minus the balance after deducting certain debts. Of this amount, 8 million taels was designated in 193X for emergency use and to strengthen future budgets. For several years, the amount used in accordance with this policy has exceeded 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>One committee member stated that increasing the tax by 1 percent of the rent will be implemented from the second half of the year. If the tax rates for the first and second halves of the year are combined, the increase is only about one-half of a percent.</p>
<p>After considering the above budget, the Finance Committee submitted it to the Board of Directors for review. After detailed discussion by the directors on the 24th of this month, it was resolved to approve the new tax schedule and the 1937 budget as proposed by the Finance Committee, and submit them to the Ratepayers' Annual Meeting.</p>

<h3>Exemption from Income Tax for Pawnshops and Various Bank Transfer Agencies</h3>
<p>Income Tax Office - Reply to the Pawnshop Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Pawnshop Association recently inquired with the Shanghai Income Tax Office regarding funds transferred between pawnshops and banks. They proposed establishing a separate entity, similar to a public clearinghouse, to serve as a transfer agency for the pawnshops. While this entity would appear to be an independent business on the surface, it would have no capital, no deposits, and no profit or loss relationship in reality. All receipts and payments would be recorded in ledgers, and all cash would be deposited and withdrawn from the banks with which it transacted. Although this transfer agency would be nominally a depositor, it would not actually hold deposits. It would have no capital for filing tax returns, and the withholding of income tax on deposit interest would be the responsibility of the banks, while the filing of business income tax would be the responsibility of the respective pawnshops. They inquired about the correct procedure for filing tax returns. The Shanghai Income Tax Office replied yesterday, stating that if the transfer agency established by the pawnshops has no capital and bears no responsibility for profits or losses, it may be exempt from taxation. However, since the entity appears to be an independent business on the surface, its business name should be reported, and this situation should be noted in the remarks column for verification. It was also learned that the association has completed the capital and deposit reports and will submit them to the Shanghai Income Tax Office today.</p>

<h3>Discussion on Adding a Branch to the Fish Market</h3>
<p>Recommendation for Tui Yuanting, et al., to Conduct Research</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fish Market under the Ministry of Industry centralizes fish sales. Although fish merchants have moved to the business location, transportation is inconvenient. Requests have been made to add a branch at the 16th Pier. The fish market held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors the day before yesterday, during which the matter was raised for discussion. After Chairman Du Yuesheng reported on the issue, it was resolved to appoint directors Kui Yanting, Fang Jiaobo, and Qu Heming to work with Manager Wang Xiaolai and Deputy Managers Zhu Kaiguan and Sun Guchen to conduct research and submit opinions for further discussion.</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai has received letters from fishermen's representatives from Dinghai County, Shenjiamen, and Xiangshan, complaining that the fish market's location is unsuitable, leading to weak sales, drastic price drops, and impacting the fishermen's economy. With the fishing season approaching, small yellow croaker boats are heading out to sea, representing the most abundant period for fish production. The fishermen's livelihoods depend entirely on this, and they requested the association to send representatives to present the fishermen's grievances to the fish market's board of directors and request prompt action to improve the situation and protect the fishing industry. The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association appointed executive committee member Mu Zi and the Dinghai Fellow Villagers Association appointed standing committee member Yuan Yang'an, along with fishermen representatives Zhou Xiunian and Gu Mingyu, to present the fishermen's plight to the fish market's board of directors yesterday afternoon and suggest improvements. Chairman Du Yuesheng personally received them, and Yuan Yang'an explained the situation. Du responded that the board of directors was planning to develop a fundamental improvement plan to benefit the fishing industry. The representatives then took their leave.</p>
<h3>Former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Bell, Passes Away</h3>
<p>Mr. Arnold Sends a Letter of Condolence to Mrs. Bell</p>
<p>Mr. Bell, who had served as the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council for the International Settlement and resided in Shanghai for 30 years, recently suffered from fever and heart disease. He passed away in the hospital on Wednesday (the 24th) at 9 p.m. at the age of 64. In addition to his business ventures, Mr. Bell also engaged in real estate, making him a prominent British expatriate in Shanghai. He served as a councilor of the Municipal Council for many years and was recently elected as chairman of the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in the International Settlement, scheduled for April 14th this year. Mr. Bell attended Oxford University in his youth and is survived by his wife and five adult children, only one of whom is currently in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Following the death of Mr. Bell, former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, on the 24th, Mr. Arnold, the current chairman of the council, sent a letter of condolence to Mrs. Bell, which is translated below: "The councilors and I at the council are deeply saddened to learn of Mr. Bell's passing. We recall Mr. Bell's service on the council for eight consecutive years, including two years as vice-chairman and two years as chairman. He also served on various committees. Mr. Bell was most dedicated to education and had been a member of the council's Education Committee since 1930, and he was recently elected as chairman of the committee. When the council's board of directors was looking for a chairman for the previous annual meeting of taxpayers, they unanimously selected Mr. Bell because he was respected by residents from all walks of life. The council had hoped that Mr. Bell would serve as chairman again at this year's annual meeting of taxpayers. All who worked with Mr. Bell admired and respected him, believing that Mr. Bell's high character, gentle nature, and fairness made him most suitable for the position of chairman. The councilors and all who knew Mr. Bell are deeply saddened by his sudden passing, both personally and professionally. I have been instructed to convey our sincerest condolences, etc."</p>
<h3>Debate in the Sun Shaoqing Case Adjourned for Review</h3>
<p>The court instructed to postpone the hearing.</p>
<p>Sun Shaoqing and his wife, Zhu, from Tongzhou, were arrested by Chief Inspector Lu Liankui and Detective Liu Shaokui of the Public Security Bureau for involvement in soliciting lawsuits, intimidation, and fraud. They were handed over to the First Special District Court. The case involves Wu Dengying, Xu Maochang, Yao Zhichun, Jiang Yangshi, Shi Dezhi, and Lu Guanzeng. The Special Court has repeatedly questioned the parties involved, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qian Hongye and Prosecutor Tang Peiyou held a hearing. The Public Security Bureau's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated that the Public Security Bureau found two seals, one with Jiang Zhaozhou and the other with Yu Zhong, at Jiang Zhaozhou's house, which he presented to the court. They also found a piece of paper with the words "uneven distribution of spoils." Judge Qian questioned Sun Shaoqing, who continued to deny the charges, claiming he was framed. He also denied soliciting the case of Jiang Guopei's property division from Jiang Yangshi, stating only that Jiang Guopei had borrowed several thousand yuan from him when the lawsuit was about to be settled. The court, finding the facts clear, ordered the debate to begin. The Public Security Bureau's lawyer, Ru, argued that Sun Shaoqing used intimidation tactics such as verbal threats, phone calls, and false accusations to extort large sums of money during the solicitation of lawsuits, and therefore should be severely punished. The defendant's lawyer, Chen Ying, then proceeded to defend Sun Shaoqing and his wife. Judge Qian then adjourned the hearing for review.</p>

<h3>Continued Hearing in Huifuli Arson Case</h3>
<p>Weili Comprador Liang Chaosheng Appears in Court to Testify; Wu Youfu Claims Hu Kechang Conceived the Plan</p>
<p>A fire occurred at No. 4 Huifuli, Lane 1024, East Xihua Road on January 19th of this year. After the incident, the police investigation determined that it was arson. Chief Detective Lu Gengsheng and others from the Old Gate Public Security Bureau arrested Wu Youfu (also known as Ying Bai), Shen Zixiang, and seven others suspected of involvement, including insurance brokers Chen Wentao, Zhou Wenwei, Jiang Baoru, Zhong Wenbin, and Cao Yu Fu (also known as Qing Yu). They were handed over to the First Special District Court and prosecuted for arson and fraud under Articles 173 and 329 of the Criminal Code. The previous hearing has been reported in this newspaper. Judge Qian Hongye held another hearing in criminal court yesterday morning. First, the Public Security Bureau's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, presented the case and stated that witness Liang Chaosheng, a comprador for Weili Insurance Company, was in court to testify that the defendant Jiang Baoru had asked him to help with the arson incident and promised to pay him a considerable reward. Liang Chaosheng was then called to the stand. He testified that Jiang Baoru was a colleague and that Jiang had mentioned to him in January that someone had asked him to intercede on their behalf regarding the fire insurance claim on East Xihua Road and offered a reward of 500 yuan, which he refused. He mentioned this to him in passing but did not ask him to help. Chief Detective Lu Gengsheng testified that on February 23rd, when he was at the residence of Huo Sheng of Yunping Notary Public, the defendant Chen Wentao came over and first talked about the insurance claim of the Dazhong Flower Factory on Huade Road, then talked about this case, saying that if he could help handle it well, there would be a 30,000 yuan fire insurance claim in Nanshi and a 50,000 yuan tobacco claim to be entrusted to him. At that time, Huo asked for the insurance policy, which was said to be at Zhong Wenbin and Cao Yu Fu's place. On the 25th, when Chen accompanied Wu Youfu and Shen Zixiang to his residence, he arrested them. Wu Youfu testified that the arson was the idea of a man named Hu Kechang, who also rented the house. He entrusted Zhou Wenwei to go through Shenchang Foreign Firm (managed by the two defendants Zhong and Cao) to insure 3,000 yuan with Weili Insurance under the name of Cen Ying. Shen Zixiang was someone he found to replace Yin Boji, and he promised Zhou Wenwei 15% of the insurance payout as a reward. Zhou Wenwei testified that when Wu Youfu asked him to take out the insurance, he mentioned the arson, but it was not confirmed. He only said that if something happened in the future, he would ask him to help. Shen Zixiang testified that Wu Youfu asked him to replace Yin Boji's name and promised to give him 50 yuan. After Judge Qian Hongye questioned Chen Wentao and Zhong Wenbin, he ordered that the case be adjourned for another hearing.</p>

Therefore, members of various corps are frequently training during March and April, extremely busy. Each person must attend the drills the required number of times to be considered qualified. It has been learned that the Chinese Corps and the Translation Corps are fully prepared, and all members began training on the 22nd of this month, under the command and training of the two corps leaders, Mr. Chen Shixia. The machine gun team members are also receiving instruction at the same time, and the number of people attending the drills each day is more than any other corps.</p>
<p>New Recruit Training: The Chinese Corps has always recruited reserve members once a year for training and replenishment. To date, this has been done for thirty-one years. This year, although more than 200 people applied, the corps is extremely strict with the investigation and examination in order to ensure quality over quantity. Therefore, they have eliminated the inferior and retained the elite, reducing the number by nearly half. After the corps' medical officer, Dr. Niu Huilin, examined the physical condition, only 70 people passed. It is reported that the training will begin in mid-April.</p>
<p>Bai Yushuang Departs</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau Sues Enpire Theater Claiming Compensation</h3>
<p>The Defendants Are Xu Peigen and Bai Yushuang’s Brother; The Plaintiff's Claims Are Divided into Five Points</p>
<p>Bai Yushuang, a female performer of Pingju (Ping Opera) and Bengbeng Opera from Beiping, whose real name is Li Guizhen, is 25 years old this year and from Beiping. She previously performed in Beiping, but was ordered to leave the country by the Beiping Municipal Government because the content of her performances was obscene and related to public morals. She came to Shanghai in a sorry state and first resided on Beile Road, and now resides at No. 1 Jian'an Lane, Kaizier Road. She was invited by Xu Peigen (41 years old this year, residing at No. 2, Lane 127, Ailige Road), a Suzhou native who runs a theatrical business, and introduced to perform at the Enpire Theater at No. 85 Xiafei Road. Because Bai Yushuang was in her prime, with a moving appearance, and her performance of plays such as "Pan Jinlian" and "Ma Widow Opens a Shop" revealed her flirtatious and obscene nature everywhere, she won over the audience in Shanghai and her reputation grew. The theater also made a large profit. As a result, a long-term performance contract was signed with Bai Yushuang. The contract was signed on behalf of Bai Yushuang by Xu Peigen of the Hebei Pingju Troupe. The terms agreed upon stated that if one party breached the contract, they would have to compensate the other party 5,000 taels of gold. From March 17th of last year to January 12th of this year,</p>
<p>a one-month break was agreed upon, with a scheduled return to the stage to continue performing on February 11th (the first day of the lunar new year). During the break, Bai Yushuang went to perform in other cities such as Wuxi. Upon her return to Shanghai, Bai Yushuang fell in love with Li Jixian, a drummer from her hometown in the same troupe. Her adoptive mother, Li Bian, was deeply dissatisfied and strongly opposed it. She also forced Li Jixian to leave Shanghai and return to the north, which caused Bai Yushuang to feel extremely stimulated. Therefore, in early February, she secretly took all her money and clothes, and under the guise of going out to give gifts, she left home</p>
<p>without saying goodbye. After Bai Yushuang left, Xu Peigen and the Enpire Theater were shocked upon hearing the news and immediately sent people out to look for her, but she has not been found to this day. After Bai Yushuang left, her adoptive mother, Li Bian, posted an advertisement in the newspaper looking for her. However, the Enpire Theater was scheduled to open on February 11th, and the audience, due to Bai Yushuang's disappearance, negotiated with the theater and made a lot of noise. The theater reported to the police, who sent officers to the scene to maintain order, and the</p>
<p>theater refunded the tickets. However, Bai Yushuang has not appeared for more than a month. The theater believes that the contract has not expired and has suffered a significant loss. Recently, Zhang Juchuan (46 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 410 Haining Road), the manager of the Enpire Theater Tongyi Company, hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the Special District Court against Xu Peigen, the head of the Hebei Pingju Troupe, and Li Guozhang (27 years old, from Beiping, residing at No. 1 Da'an Lane, Kaizier Road), Bai Yushuang's brother, seeking damages and breach of contract. The key points of the lawsuit are divided into five points: ㊀</p>
<p>Compensation for breach of contract in the amount of 5,000 gold yuan; ㊁ To bear the damages suffered by the Enpire Theater due to Bai Yushuang's disappearance; ㊂ To bear the litigation costs of this case; ㊃ If the first defendant, Xu Peigen, is unable to bear the costs, the second defendant, Li Guozhang, shall bear them; ㊄ The plaintiff provides a guarantee and requests permission to announce the execution of the judgment. The court approved the application, and Judge Wu Xiaoke held a hearing in Civil Court 4 yesterday morning. Both parties were represented by lawyers, and Bai Yushuang's mother, Li Bian, also attended the hearing. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated</p>
<p>the purpose of the lawsuit and the object of the judgment sought. The lawyer for the first defendant, Xu Peigen, stated that Xu himself was still in Hankou and could not attend the hearing. The disappearance of Bai Yushuang was something that the defendant was also passive about, and it was an unusual event. Furthermore, the Enpire Theater is still open, so he requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The lawyer for the first defendant, Li Guozhang, stated that the second defendant was not responsible for the Hebei Troupe, nor was he involved with the Enpire Theater. He was only related to Bai Yushuang as a brother, and in law, a brother does not have the right to guarantee or restrict his sister's actions. He should not be held responsible for this lawsuit and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The court reviewed the statements and ordered that the case be investigated and adjourned to April 7th for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Sea Freight Ship Fire; Inspected cargo set for date; apportionment</h3>

<h3>Hotel Deposit Dispute - Promissory Note Case Still Pending</h3>
<p>Han Maosheng testified that he had deposited money once, but Han Maotang claimed it was a conspiracy to defraud.</p>
<p>Han Maotang from Shaoxing, formerly a shareholder and accountant at the Maochang Egg Factory on Huangpu Road, and the owner of the Nanyang Hotel at 435 East Seward Road, sold the hotel to his cousin Han Maosheng due to poor business. Recently, Chen Zhongxiong, a Ningbo native working as a sailor foreman on the Sanbei Company's Wanxiang Steamer, hired a lawyer to sue Han Maotang in the First Special Court's Civil Division for failing to honor promissory notes for deposits totaling 4,500 yuan when he was the owner of the Nanyang Hotel.</p>
<p>During the trial, Chen Maotang had left Shanghai and was residing in Yangjialong Xinjiaqiao village in Shaoxing. (It was said that bandits intended to kidnap him, so he dared not come to Shanghai.) Chen Zhongxiong's lawyer requested a default judgment, which was not granted. After public notification, the case, along with the two promissory notes, was transferred to the Shaoxing Local Court for trial. However, it was discovered that the two promissory notes had</p>
<p>suspicious forgeries. According to photographs of the fingerprints taken by Westerners from the Hongkou Police Department's Chinese Detective Zhu Jihuang, there were issues with the seals and signatures. On the afternoon of the 15th of this month, officers from the Nanshi Dongjiadu Water Patrol Police Station boarded the Wanxiang Steamer and arrested Chen Huijin, taking him to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The plaintiffs and defendants each had their own version of events. The court ordered Chen Huijin to be remanded in custody pending verification of the promissory notes. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xieffen continued the trial. According to witness Han Maosheng, the Nanyang Hotel was initially opened solely by his cousin Maotang, who was also the manager, while he was a salesman. The hotel suffered losses due to the January 28th</p>
<p>Shanghai War. Bandits also came to the hotel in a car looking for Han Maotang, who had reportedly won over 100,000 yuan in a lottery on a horse race. At that time, he had already returned to his hometown and was not present. He wrote a letter notifying him that the defendant, Chen Zhongxiong, had made an initial deposit of 2,000 yuan, introduced by him, in February of the 22nd year of the Republic, for a term of six months. Chen claimed that the money had been repaid in full. Subsequently, the 4,500 yuan deposit was made directly between them. When he took over the hotel, including all its assets, in February of last year, Chen later asked him about the 4,500 yuan</p>
<p>deposit. He said that Maotang was currently in his hometown and would take care of it when it was due. Because when he took over the hotel, he published a notice stating that Maotang was responsible for all debts owed by and to the hotel. However, Han Maotang claimed that he did not know Chen Zhongxiong at all, and that the initial deposit of 2,000 yuan and the subsequent 4,500 yuan were all part of a conspiracy to defraud by Maosheng and the accountant Lin Chunxuan. The defendant insisted that there was no falsehood. The lawyer requested bail, but Judge Xiao, because the two promissory notes had not yet been retrieved for verification, ordered Chen Zhongxiong to provide a shop guarantee of 8,000 yuan and not to leave Shanghai before the case was concluded. The hearing was adjourned for further verification.</p>
<h3>Meiya Factories 1 and 7 Resume Work</h3>
<p>Conditions for resumption to be mediated by the Party and government.</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that the workers of the Meiya Jingwei General Factory at 333 Rihui East Road, South Shanghai, and the Meiya Factory No. 7 at 1403 Quzhenren Road, went on strike to demand improved treatment. Upon hearing this news, the Party and government agencies immediately sent personnel to advise them. Now, all the workers of Jingwei have returned to work at 7:00 AM yesterday, and the workers of Factory No. 7 also returned to work at 9:10 AM yesterday. As for the conditions of demands raised by the workers, it has been decided to await the Party and government agencies to include them in the citywide silk factory dispute industry for mediation and settlement.</p>
<h3>Descendant of a Qing Dynasty General Involved in Inheritance Dispute</h3>
<p>Burial plot of over ten mu now part of municipal government land; court ordered investigation of land value before further trial.</p>
<p>Wang Jintang from Fujian, who passed away decades ago, was a former Qing Dynasty General and Director of the Telegraph Bureau. He later became an envoy to six countries and was granted the Yellow Riding Jacket, a high-ranking official of his time. Because he traveled to Jiangsu for his official career, he moved to Shanghai. He had four sons: the eldest, Tingchu, deceased; the second, Tingliang, deceased; the third, Tingzhang, deceased; and the fourth, Tingrui, also known as Zhuzhai, now 60 years old. Wang Jintang passed away long ago in the 17th year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign. His assets were divided then. However, recently, Wang Gong, the eldest grandson's wife, the daughter-in-law of Tingchu, 59 years old, sued Wang Zheng, the wife of Tingliang, 72 years old, and Wang Zhuzhai in the local court, requesting a division of the joint property. It is claimed that, in addition to those divided, there were 30 shares of telegraph stock, which were agreed to be reserved for the ancestral burial expenses. Later, the stock was converted into cash, and 10 mu, 6 fen, 8 li, and 6 hao of land in the 25th Bao, 25th Tu of Shangyi County were purchased in the name of Huaiyintang Wang as a burial site. However, apart from the burial of Jintang and his wife, subsequent coffins were not buried due to the belief in geomancy. Even the plaintiff's husband has not been buried. Wang Zhuzhai is cunning and has accumulated a considerable fortune. Wang Zheng holds the land deed and has repeatedly demanded a division, while the third branch, Wang Zhu, has already agreed. However, Wang Zheng holds on tightly, and Wang Zhuzhai is indecisive, leaving her isolated and helpless, on the verge of starvation. Now, the land is located in the municipal government's base area. Not only can those who have not been buried no longer be buried, but those who have been buried should also be moved. Therefore, she requests that one-quarter of the original amount of land be divided, but the land price at the time was originally 180 taels, now equivalent to 251 yuan in national currency. Yesterday, Judge Xu Shunqing opened the court, but the defendant was not present. Lawyer Zhu Xiyun appeared in court on behalf of the defendant and stated that the current value of the land is 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per mu, totaling 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The claim that the land price is 252 yuan is clearly inconsistent. The judge ordered that the land price should be investigated first before further trial. For now, it is tentatively calculated at 2,000 yuan per mu, and the plaintiff is ordered to pay an additional valuation fee of 63 yuan before the court was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Lawyer Xu Yi Sues Li Tianzhi for False Accusation After Exoneration</h3>
<p>Seeking damages of over 30,000 yuan; Final arguments concluded yesterday, awaiting verdict.</p>
<p>Lawyer Xu Yi was previously sued by Cheng Li Tianzhi, the wife of real estate tycoon Cheng Linsheng, and Li Tianzhi's brother, Li Quanshen, in the local court for stealing a seal and forging a legal counsel agreement worth 20,000 yuan. Judge Tan Zhuohong sentenced Xu to four months in prison. Xu appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, which overturned the conviction and declared him innocent. Soon after, Tan Zhuohong was sent to the Wuxian Local Court by the Ministry of Justice for colluding with lawyer Yang Shaopeng and accepting bribes, and was sentenced to eight years in prison. Xu Yi's conviction was also considered</p>
<p>one of the bribes. Later, Tan and Yang appealed, and in this case, due to lack of conclusive evidence, Tan's sentence was reduced to four years. However, Xu Yi sued Tan Zhuohong in the Shanghai Local Court for dereliction of duty and wrongful judgment, and sued Cheng Li Tianzhi and Li Quanshen for false accusation. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Xuedeng opened the court to hear the case. First, he heard the self-accusation against Tan Zhuohong. Tan did not appear, and only Xu Yi stated that Cheng Li Tianzhi and Li Quanshen hired lawyer Yang Shaopeng to bribe Tan Zhuohong,</p>
<p>resulting in a wrongful conviction. The Wuxian Local Court has already convicted Tan and Yang in this case. Later, the High Court did not take action because a sentence of "after a satisfactory verdict" was deleted from the agreement between Cheng Li Tianzhi and Yang, and it could not be immediately proven as evidence of bribery. "I requested the prosecutor to appeal, but it was not adopted. But the wrongful conviction is correct." The judge instructed that the case file had been retrieved and would be reviewed. Then, the judge heard the case against Cheng Li Tianzhi and others for false accusation. First, he questioned Xu Yi, 32 years old, from Zhongshan, residing on Tangshan Road. The self-accusation stated that the defendants' false accusation had already been</p>
<p>found innocent by the Jiangsu High Court. Now, a civil suit is attached, seeking damages of 33,980 yuan. Next, he questioned Cheng Li Tianzhi, 53 years old, whose husband's family is from Shexian, Anhui, residing on Sapsay Road. The judge asked, "You sued Xu Yi for forging documents. You originally hired lawyer Li Shirui. How did Yang Shaopeng get added?" She replied, "Because lawyer Li was sick." The judge asked, "What was the fee?" She replied, "4,000 yuan." The judge asked, "It is said that you bribed 8,000 yuan. Is that true?" She replied, "No." The judge asked, "The agreement says that 2,000 yuan was paid in advance, and another 2,000 yuan would be paid after a satisfactory verdict." She replied, "I paid in full." The judge asked, "You didn't</p>
<p>know how to write before?" She replied, "I can write my name, but not very well." The judge asked, "Why didn't you sign the transcript in the High Court, but made a cross instead?" She replied, "Seven years ago, in the year of Wuchen, I was involved in a lawsuit in the High Court over family matters. There is a contract in the file that I signed myself." The judge asked, "You reached a settlement with Xu Yi in the High Court. The entrusted 20,000 yuan was waived by Xu Yi, but another 3,000 to 4,000 yuan in advances were requested through the mediation of relatives and friends. Is that true?" She replied, "That's what he said. There's no such thing at all." The judge asked, "Can you</p>
<p>prove that the seal on this agreement is not yours?" She replied, "I don't have this seal at all." The judge asked, "Exactly how many cases did you ask him to handle?" She replied, "Just one case of proving something. Nothing else." At this point, the judge questioned Li Quanshen, 48 years old, from Wuxi. The judge asked, "Your agreement says 2,000 yuan, and another 2,000 yuan will be paid after a satisfactory verdict." He replied, "That's how the accountant Hu Zhetin did it. Lawyer Li Shirui wrote it later, and if there was any bribery, why didn't we change the agreement?" The judge asked, "This note requires 4,000 yuan, which seems a lot.</p>
<p>It seems that it would not have been much to ask Xu Yi for 20,000." He replied, "Because Li Shirui took 6,000 at that time, and Yang Shaopeng is in the same profession,</p>
<p>so it couldn’t be less, so he took 4,000." The judge asked, "According to the investigation, there are many documents in your factory that you signed and sealed." He replied, "I ask lawyers to put many seals and signatures, and Xu wrote my nephew’s name, so he was very trusted, etc." At this point, Xu Yi also said, "Yang Shaopeng issued a court fee of 4,000 yuan, and Cheng Li Tianzhi entrusted me with a divorce from her ex-husband, which is not a big deal." At this point, the court announced that the final arguments have been concluded, and the verdict will be announced on the 27th. Li Quanshen was released on bail to his lawyer.</p>

<h3>Minutes of the Chinese Dental Association Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>The fourth regular meeting of the Chinese Dental Association of this year was held at 8:00 PM on the 24th at the British Returned Students Association. Attending officials included Yan Suiliang, Wei Jieying, Lan Shou, Ye Jingfu, Shen Guozuo, and members Huang Bingji, Lu Jia, Xu Shaoming, and over 20 others. First, Chairman Yan Suiliang gave a welcoming speech on behalf of everyone. Dr. Yan Fuqing, President of the Red Cross Society, attended the meeting and expressed his gratitude. Yan's speech, with the main points recorded below: ㊀ Report on the resolutions of the previous meeting; ㊁ How to respond to the letter from the Chinese Medical Association, decided to be answered by the secretary; ㊂ Report on the completion of the Zhongshan Hospital and invite for a visit; ㊃ How to entertain Dr. Lindsay, the American dental education advisor to the National Government, who is visiting Shanghai, decided to hold a banquet at the International General Assembly on the evening of the 26th. Dr. Yan Fuqing's speech: "Dental specialized schools have become an urgent matter in our country, and this city is even more suitable. However, to manage it completely and meet international standards, the heavy responsibility must be entrusted to your association. In general, for any undertaking, economic strength is the primary condition, but what is more important than economics is talent. Otherwise, a large amount of money will be spent, but if talent is not considered, the result will often be failure. But even more important than that is to have a selfless spirit, a spirit of sacrifice to await it, then success can be assured. The Shanghai Red Cross Society and the Shanghai Medical College have come to this day through long-term struggle. Their goal is not to exploit people, not to serve only the rich, but to serve the poor and the general public with an honest spirit and gain their trust. And although doctors are produced for the purpose of treating diseases, this is only treating the symptoms. Beyond that, there is a more important duty, which is to prevent the occurrence of diseases, in other words, to serve the public. When the Shanghai Medical College was founded, there was only the general medical department, but we were always planning to establish a complete public service organization, such as a nursing class, an obstetrics class, and a pharmacy class. Until recently, we have been able to satisfy some needs and establish them one by one. What is regrettable and has been pondered for a long time without being realized is the dental specialized school. But in terms of past successes, it is not difficult to realize it under your leadership."</p>
<h3>National Products Industry Association Investigates Domestic Products</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Shanghai National Products Industry Association, in order to investigate domestic products and promote them, sent letters to its member manufacturers yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir/Madam, we hereby forward the instruction from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, forwarding the order from the Ministry of Industry, reiterating the government's case of purchasing and using domestic products. It is stipulated that reimbursement should not be approved for those who still purchase and use foreign goods when domestic substitutes are available. It is ordered to investigate domestic products and submit forms for reporting, so that the adoption can be notified to agencies across the country," etc. We found that in recent years, domestic products in our country have been developing rapidly and are able to compete with foreign goods. The government's order to agencies across the country to use domestic goods in the future when purchasing goods is a great opportunity for our domestic goods industry to promote their products. All domestic goods manufacturers should fill out and submit the forms to report all their products according to the law, so that the government can notify agencies across the country to adopt them. For the purpose of promoting propaganda, the association has decided through a committee meeting to compile the types of goods from various domestic goods factories and their advantages into a National Products Monthly Report, which will be distributed to Party and government agencies and industrial and commercial circles in provinces, cities, and counties across the country for reference. All factories are requested to fill out and report the forms immediately, so that they can be compiled and widely publicized.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Allocates 10,000 Yuan to Subsidize the Construction of Longhua Scenic Area</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee for the Construction of the Longhua Scenic Area to Commemorate Mr. Wang Yiting's 70th Birthday has been actively carrying out its work since its establishment. The committee believes that construction requires funds everywhere, and has specially requested the municipal government to allocate funds to subsidize it to facilitate progress. The committee received instructions from the municipal government yesterday, agreeing to allocate a subsidy of 10,000 yuan to jointly contribute to the grand achievement. The original text is as follows: "The presentation and minutes of the meeting have been noted.

It is hoped that the committee will find ways to raise the remaining amount as soon as possible. The original plan will still be actively carried out: ㊀ Planting trees, ㊁ Building pavilions, ㊂ Building roads, ㊃ Arranging the landscape, ㊄ Repairing halls.

<h3>Rickshaw Guild Requests Extension of Rickshaw Puller Registration Time</h3>
<p>The public concession reduced the number of rickshaws. The guild has handled the public allocation registration, which has been completed. However, the guild has requested an extension of time for rickshaw puller registration due to insufficient processing. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Public Allocation Completed: After the Shanghai Municipal Council decided to reduce the number of public rickshaws within the concession by 500 on June 1st of this year, the Rickshaw Guild handled the public allocation registration. It was originally stipulated that those with 11 to 20 rickshaws would have one rickshaw reduced, and for every additional ten rickshaws, one more would be reduced. Those with less than ten rickshaws would be assessed 15 yuan per rickshaw. Later, the rickshaw owners decided to change the method, reducing one rickshaw for every 20 rickshaws. Since the registration began, more than 480 rickshaws have been registered, and more than 1,000 yuan in loss fees have been collected. The registration has already ended, and the registered rickshaws will be collected on June 1st to reach 500, and all magnetic license plates will be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council for cancellation. The Shanghai Municipal Council will then be requested to re-number the remaining rickshaws.</p>
<p>Extension of Registration: At the same time, based on the rickshaw owners' request, the Shanghai Municipal Council will supplement the registration of 3,500 rickshaw pullers from the 10th to fill the vacancies, as only 30,000 of the 41,500 registered rickshaw pullers remain. The rickshaw owners will introduce and retain the rickshaw pullers. The deadline was originally today, but as most of the rickshaw pullers are in their hometowns and have not returned to Shanghai, only over 2,000 have registered. The Rickshaw Guild has decided to request the Shanghai Municipal Council to extend the time so that unemployed rickshaw pullers have the opportunity to seek a livelihood. At the same time, the guild has notified rickshaw owners to investigate and report the actual number of rickshaw pullers in order to understand the true situation. When there are vacancies, the Shanghai Municipal Council will be requested to register them. The guild has requested the Shanghai Municipal Council to crack down on nominal rickshaw pullers.</p>
<p>Ticket Sales at Stations: The Wuxian General Labor Union sent letters to the two Railway Bureaus, the Rickshaw Guild, the Rickshaw Puller Association, and the Rickshaw Puller General Labor Union yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir/Madam, the rickshaw puller trade union affiliated with our union is negotiating with the Railway Bureau on the method of selling rickshaw tickets at the stations. However, during this initial stage, the various rules and regulations are still to be formulated. We have found that your office has been implementing the purchase and sale of rickshaw tickets for a long time, and the rules and regulations are quite complete. We are sending this letter to respectfully request that you provide us with multiple copies for our reference. We would be very grateful."</p>

<h3>Easter Special Concert</h3>
<p>Organized by the Municipal Council Music Team</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Music Team will host a special Easter concert tonight (the 26th) at 9:15 PM at the Lyceum Theatre. The team has not held such a concert in nearly six years. This year, they have rearranged a special program to embellish the festive season. Music enthusiasts will undoubtedly be deeply interested. All programs are musical pieces commemorating the resurrection of Jesus, divided into two parts. The first part is "The Passion of Jesus," complete with solo singing and strings. This piece has three sections: one is "The Last Supper," one is "Prayer in the Mountains," and one is "The Lord Ascends to Heaven." The entire performance will take over an hour. The role of Christ will be sung by the famous bass singer, Mr. Su Shilin, accompanied by Mr. Bos and Mr. Gottlib Vadick. The second part is "Stabat Mater" and "Passiontide Music." The soloists will include one bass and one soprano. The chorus will be composed of members of the Russian Choir and the Shanghai Choir. The original text (in Latin) of the "Passion" they sing and translations into six languages (English, French, German, Russian, and Chinese) have been combined into a booklet for distribution to the audience. The cost of this concert is relatively high, so the ticket prices have been slightly increased. Seats can be reserved during the day at the Lyceum Theatre.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Factory Affairs Management Office</h3>
<p>Annual Expenditure Budget</p>
<p>The 1937 expenditure budget of the Shanghai Municipal Council Factory Affairs Management Office has been approved by the board of directors. The original budget draft submitted by the office totaled 67,620 yuan (excluding the cost of purchasing supplies). Subsequently, based on the recommendations of the Staff Economic Committee and with some frugality in other areas, it is estimated that a total of 64,330 yuan is needed, an increase of 6,370 yuan compared to the amount opened in last year's budget. The Lester Institute of Medical Research plans to open a canteen for child laborers, subsidized by the Municipal Council with 3,000 yuan. This is one reason for the increased expenditure of the Factory Affairs Management Office.</p>
<h3>Cao Shuming's Lecture on Soviet National Defense (Continued)</h3>
<p>Fourth, Laws: Soviet laws also have great significance in national defense. Generally speaking, every principle and every word of Soviet laws is strictly enforced. Most importantly: First, espionage. The Soviet Union does not tolerate espionage. If foreigners are found to be engaged in espionage in the Soviet Union, they are immediately sentenced according to criminal law without hesitation. Regarding espionage, no matter which country the offender belongs to, the law is enforced equally. Sometimes, diplomatic relations are severed for this reason. Why is this the case? Because tolerating espionage is much more harmful and greater than severing diplomatic relations. Second, colluding with spies. If Soviet citizens are found to be suspected of colluding with spies, in other words, if they are suspected of being traitors, they must be tried according to law. No matter how high the offender's position is in the party and the country, they must be sentenced according to law without leniency. Why is this the case? Because leniency towards traitors can lead to more traitors and bigger traitors. To eradicate the root, the Soviet Union strictly cracks down on spies and traitors. This point is worth our attention.</p>
<p>Fifth, Finance: The finance of a country and the national defense of a country are closely related. Soviet finance has the following key points in national defense:</p>
<p>㊀ Gold and silver are state-owned. Currently, Soviet citizens cannot privately possess gold and silver. If they violate this principle, once discovered, it will be confiscated and they will be punished. Gold and silver are concentrated in the Soviet treasury. With a full treasury, all defense-related parities are in place. According to recent reports from Moscow, the Soviet Union's gold reserves are second only to the United States. From this, we can see the strength of the Soviet national power.</p>
<p>㊁ Foreign currencies cannot be freely used in the Soviet Union. Anyone bringing foreign currency to the Soviet Union must exchange it for rubles for use. Only in this way can foreign currencies not disrupt Soviet finance.</p>
<p>㊂ Since last year, when the Soviet ruble established a connection with the French franc and used a fixed exchange rate, the Soviet monetary system has been further stabilized. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Hopes for Newspaper Workers</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>The Shanghai Newspaper Workers' Union and the Newspaper Workers' Children's School will hold a tenth-anniversary celebration today, reporting the historical facts of the past ten years and all future facilities to the public. Therefore, special publications are being compiled in various newspapers. I am honored to be invited to write an article. At first, I thought I had no opinions to contribute to the newspaper workers, but then I thought that newspaper workers and us reporters are colleagues and are standing on the same front line. We are like lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. Even if there is nothing to say, I have to say a few words:</p>
<p>First: Newspaper workers have a newspaper workers' union, and reporters have a reporters' association. Although the names and realities may be different, the purpose of uniting and contacting each other is the same. Judging from past facts, newspaper workers seem to have more spirit and strength than reporters in terms of their own interests and organizational tightness. I have always been very sympathetic. If you can further refine your training skills and cultivate your character in the future, you will surely achieve great success after ten years.</p>
<p>Second: Newspaper workers have paid attention to the education of their children from the beginning. Over the past ten years, they have cultivated many good new young people. This vision is indeed far-sighted. I think that in the future, if we can go further and add vocational schools to openly enroll students and provide rigorous training in various printing technologies such as typesetting, composing, plating, and casting, and cultivate specialized talents, that will be more closely related to the future of the newspaper industry.</p>
<p>Third: In addition to the commemorative meeting and entertainment meeting today, there is also an exhibition of Chinese and foreign newspapers and printing patterns (including typefaces, etc.). Newspaper workers have spent a lot of effort to create this bright and splendid event, which I sincerely admire. In the future, I hope that newspaper workers can take on more responsibilities and work hard with us to move forward, forward! Due to limited space here, the rest of the words are tacitly understood.</p>

<h3>Modern Politics and China (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Junshan</p>
<p>The first is military failure against foreign countries. During the war, these countries all failed militarily against foreign countries, so naturally they did not have the time to deal with politics calmly. Second, because of military failure, the national economy was depleted, the treasury was emptied during the war, and a lot of war debts were incurred. Third, the result of military failure against foreign countries caused domestic unrest and the outbreak of revolution. At the same time, domestic political parties did not have a long history. So-called representation of public opinion and joint management of national affairs had too little contribution to the people because the foundation was not solid. At this time, a special talent emerged. He deeply felt that the country was in imminent danger of survival, and he also deeply felt that collective discussions did not meet the current requirements: because strong countries are in a relaxed situation, their politics can still be handled calmly, while weak countries are in an urgent situation and must have extraordinary measures. Therefore, they stood up and took on the responsibility of reviving the nation and reviving the motherland. Therefore, we can say that today's victorious countries in the world can calmly implement party politics: today's defeated countries in the world can only implement one-party politics. Today's victorious countries in the world may be able to talk about collective politics: today's defeated countries in the world can only take the road of leadership politics. These are all iron-clad facts, not fabricated by me personally.</p>
<p>Now let's turn our heads and look at our China. Is today's China victorious against foreign countries? Is the economy developed? Do political parties have a long history? Think about it, which condition can we meet? Such a defeated country still shamelessly learns from others, learning a bit of everything, which is really ridiculous and pitiful. (The end of Zhu)</p>
<h3>Congratulating the "Newspaper Workers' Union" on its Tenth Anniversary</h3>
<p>— Shao Xubai</p>
<p>The birth of a life is a very happy and precious thing. However, the growth of a life is even more worthy of our happiness and preciousness. We often hear people say that "starting a business is difficult, and inheriting a business is even more difficult," which is what this means. Whether we are talking about animals or plants, this is the case. We have unspeakable love for a newborn life, and we naturally love a life that has already grown even more! Moreover, we hope that this life that has already grown will have better growth, and that its life will continue endlessly, proportionally increasing its glory!</p>
<p>The life of the "Newspaper Workers' Union" has been in existence in society for ten years. When the inaugural meeting was held, I think it must have been filled with the hopes of many people. Everyone took care of this new life as it gradually grew and developed its career to create its glorious historical traces. Time has passed day by day, and it can be said that it has only taken a moment to reach ten years. These ten years are not long, and the "Newspaper Workers' Union" has indeed made extraordinary efforts. It has made extremely superior contributions to the nation, the country, society, and newspaper workers. Anyone who is even slightly concerned about the labor movement will definitely know his contributions!</p>
<p>Although "ten years" cannot be said to be long, in our Chinese environment, in this era of metabolism, in this chaotic situation, it is indeed not easy for a social group to exist for ten years. Its existence must have gone through countless difficulties. It has struggled and fought for these difficulties. Naturally, in the process of these struggles and fights, it has also tempered its strength. When we open the chronicle of the "Newspaper Workers' Union" and see its great journey, then we can think of how the Newspaper Workers' Union has had great power for ten years;</p>
<p>A great entrepreneur has endless development plans, and his strength only increases day by day. He always moves forward without fear of setbacks. Although the "Newspaper Workers' Union" has such a glorious history, brilliant achievements, and strong strength, its future is not limited to this. Its life will continue for who knows how many years. In order to commemorate the past and to create the future, then it should not hesitate to seize the present and work hard to make it a more great and glorious group! This is my celebration and hope for the Newspaper Workers' Union!</p>
<p>At the same time, our working masses should hold hands tightly and mobilize to work hard for the nation, the country, society, and the workers!</p>
<h3>A Review of the School's Ten Years</h3>
<p>— Wu Ruishu</p>
<p>It has been ten years since the establishment of this school. The beginnings were difficult, but the initial infrastructure is now complete. I, Ruishu, have been the principal of this school for ten years. I am happy to be celebrating the tenth anniversary. I will briefly describe the school's progress over the past ten years as follows. I hope that those who care about this school will continue to offer encouragement and help us succeed together. This is truly my sincere hope.</p>
<p>This school was founded by members of the Shanghai Newspaper Workers' Vocational Union, specifically to nurture the children of newspaper workers. If there are any vacancies, external students will be admitted, so the fees are extremely low. The children of workers are not charged any fees, and external students are only charged for books and supplies. All expenses are donated by major newspapers and workers. At the beginning of the school, the monthly operating expenses were only over one hundred yuan because there were only two classrooms in the elementary school. Later, with the expansion of classrooms and the addition of senior classes, it cost at least 450 yuan, and this did not include temporary expenses. The fees collected for books and supplies from the outside world, in addition to covering temporary expenses, had almost no surplus. Fortunately, the union members were enthusiastic about education and did not complain about the hardships. In addition to paying regular monthly expenses, they also donated a day's wage at the end of the year, so the income and expenditure could be offset. However, it was already a struggle.</p>
<p>When this school was first established, it leased a house from the Wu family on Zhuangjia Street, which had only two classrooms and 72 students. Later, it gradually expanded, opening a new classroom every semester. Due to the lack of school buildings, it moved to Xicangqiao Street and started classes in the spring and autumn seasons. At its peak, there were more than 400 students, divided into eight classrooms. However, they were all limited to the elementary level. At that time, it was still in the early stages of development and had not been registered in accordance with the law. It was not until 1930 that the board of directors was formally established and approved for registration with the Municipal Bureau of Education, which issued a certificate and a seal. Later, during the January 28 Incident, almost the entire city was evacuated, and the number of households and students suddenly decreased sharply. Therefore, it was reduced to six classrooms and moved to No. 16 Xiaotaoyuan. In the first semester of 1934, the board of directors decided to cancel the spring semester and add senior classes, still with six classrooms. Thus, a complete elementary school was established. Last year, due to the small campus size, which was not enough to accommodate students, it moved again to No. 60 Xicang Road. This semester, there are a total of 357 students, with the children of workers accounting for about half. This summer vacation, the sixth grade will hold its first graduation ceremony. Before 1935, this school only went up to the fourth grade because it did not have senior classes. A total of eleven elementary school graduation ceremonies have been held, with a total of 169 graduates. Among them, about 60% went on to higher education, while the rest mostly engaged in business. However, less than 20% of those who went on to higher education later entered middle school. The rest entered the business world after graduating from senior elementary school, while most of the girls served in families. Currently, there are probably less than ten people studying in middle school.</p>
<p>I, Ruishu, have held this position for ten years and have made no achievements. I ask myself, I am ashamed, but due to the pressure of life, I have not been able to devote myself to this work, and there have been many more shortcomings. Fortunately, with the support of my colleagues in the newspaper industry and the leadership of the school board, as well as the support of the teachers, I will not be despised by experts. In the future, I will work harder to live up to the original intentions of the organizers. I hope to receive your teachings and correct my shortcomings. Then, not only will I, Ruishu, benefit from it, but the students will also benefit infinitely. This is what I humbly pray for.</p>

<h3>The "Juren" Play</h3>
<p>— Ye Hong</p>
<p>Huangcun is a small town in M County. These days, the air in the village has suddenly become very tense. It is said that a "Juren Gong" (a person who passed the imperial exam at the provincial level) has returned from the city to get married, and he will also worship his ancestors and perform a "Juren Play" to honor his ancestors and increase the prestige of the "Juren Gong."</p>
<p>This news spread throughout the village at once, and everyone in the village had a triumphant smile on their face. The elders were even busier, gathering at the ancestral hall in the morning and at the ancestral hall in the evening, almost losing all their "goat beards" from busyness.</p>
<p>In front of the village elementary school, which was transformed from the ancestral hall, a tall stage made of sunflower leaves suddenly rose up. A blue sky and white sun national flag was erected on the top of the stage, fluttering in the wind. Every time the elders passed by, they would have to stop, stretch their necks to look for a while, open their countless wrinkled old eyes, touch their beards, and their hearts would seem to flutter a little.</p>
<p>The village elementary school was closed a few days ago, and the teachers had long since left. The elementary school students were happy to run around the village with the wild children.</p>
<p>The auspicious day arrived, and the people in the village were agitated like maggots, with happy and smug faces.</p>
<p>On that day, the ancestral hall was cleaned thoroughly, and offerings such as three animals and fruits were placed on the altar. Eternal lights were lit, and incense and candles were burned. On the official seats on both sides, red cushions were spread. The elders were also wearing excellent robes and jackets, and they were busy going in and out of the ancestral hall as if they were important.</p>
<p>At the chosen auspicious time, the village chief ordered all the brave soldiers in the village to arm themselves and escort the sedan chair to welcome the "Juren." The local gentry ran ahead with smiling faces, setting off firecrackers along the way, sounding gongs and drums, and shouting from the warriors, forming a noisy sound. The narrow village road was filled with people, as lively as the Bodhisattva grandpa going on a tour, all the way marching towards the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>The "Juren Gong" wore a long gown and mandarin jacket, and descended from the sedan chair with grace, surrounded by a group of elders and local gentry into the ancestral hall. The long string of firecrackers hanging in front of the ancestral hall exploded with a crackling sound. Then, the gongs, drums, and flutes on the stage also began to play together, making a earth-shattering noise.</p>
<p>After a while, the "Juren's wife" also came in a red sedan chair carried by eight people. At this time, the people in front of the ancestral hall were even more crowded.</p>
<p>"Look at the Juren Gong!"</p>
<p>"Look at the Juren's wife!"</p>
<p>Men and women stretched their necks and squeezed around, scrambling to squeeze into the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>After the "Juren Gong" and "Juren's wife" performed three kneelings and nine kowtows to the altar, they were finally led by the elders and local gentry, struggling through the crowd, to climb onto the boxes of the stage. Then, hundreds of eyeballs were focused on the stage. After a moment, the "Eight Immortals Celebrate Longevity" began to be performed on the stage, winning countless cheers from the audience.</p>
<p>That night, the ancestral hall was filled with hundreds of dollars' worth of "Juren wine," and the next day there would be a "thank you feast."</p>
<p>At the same time, in front of the ancestral hall, a large yellow paper with red characters was posted high:</p>
<p>"Congratulations to your ancestral hall, Mr. × printed ××, who graduated from the Department of Economics of the Faculty of Law of the National ×× University with excellent results, was jointly examined by the Minister of Education of the National Government × and the President of the National ×× University, and was awarded a Bachelor of Laws degree. The request to the National Government for registration was approved, and he was allowed to be appointed as a senior civil official and judge, and will be promoted soon."</p>
<p>This banner, set off by the couplet "Glorifying the ancestors and respecting the ancestors" in front of the ancestral hall, complemented each other.</p>
