<h3>北行途次</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員西民</p>
<p>七月三十一日午夜十一時半，記者從上海寓所乘黃包車穿過紅紅綠綠的霓虹燈閃耀着，一列列長蛇似的汽車靜靜躺在馬路沿邊等候許多在舞塲酣舞的主人乘坐的跑馬廳一帶，悄然乘滬平通車北上。</p>
<p>走到售票處，詢問到徐州轉隴海車至鄭州的票價和臥舖，我的旁邊擠上來一個中年的旅客，問售票員滬平通車到什麼地方為止，售票員回答是濟南。‘濟南！昨天不是還可到滄州嗎？為什麽路綫縮短得這樣快？’我在驚訝中，不禁脫口問出這樣幾句話，坐在售票處的那位瘦瘦的售票員對記者望了一眼，沒有作聲，只搖了搖頭，面部的表情是帶着十二分的惆悵！我的心完全被他那悲哀的情感所激動了。但是動盪在我心頭的，不是消極的悲哀，而是滿腔的悲憤和勇氣。</p>
<p>滬平車的機車發出了一聲長吼，車身開始蠕動，我懷着一股雄壯的熱情讓車身帶去，在黑黝沉靜的原野裹奔馳。一間可以容納四個旅客的二等車臥室，只躺着我一個人，寂寞緊緊的包圍着我，好在夜深人倦，車到崑山便昏昏睡去了。</p>
<p>翌日一覺醒來，天已大亮，從車窗中向外一望，但見秀麗雄偉的棲霞山的山景一片片向後掠過，原來車已快到南京了。我方面打着呵欠，一方面目不轉睛的注視着往後飛過的棲霞山的山峯，內心充滿了許多感慨。不禁默禱着；棲霞山啊！但願你是捍衛京城的鐵壁，阻住胡虜侵略到長江！</p>
<p>車到下關，上下的旅客不多，我還是一個人佔據着一間，向報販賣了一份當日的中央日報，天津保定被日機轟炸，傷亡極慘的大標題，刺入我的眼廉，汪主席在廬山的演講詞，一句句的讀下去，讀到舉國一致犧牲，不留一個傀儡種子的一段的時候，火車剛巧已駛入長江渡輪，準備駛過江去。在往年沒有添置渡輪的時侯旅行者渡江是一件極麻煩的事情，現在當然便利多了，不過時間的躭擱要是與有鐵橋比起來，那又不可以道里計了。車身被渡輸載着駛在江心，我看看四週的江水和兩岸景物，心中突然湧上這樣一倆問題。中日兩國大規模戰爭如果正式爆發，以敵人雄厚的空軍力量怕很容易將我國的鐵道交通破壞，那時侯，恐怕長江的渡輪怕也難像今天一樣，可以平穩地將長江南北兩岸的車輛作聯繫的運輸。這不是杞人憂天，在敵人謀我無所不施其極的目前是很有可能性的，為了軍事上運輸的便利和安甯，政府當局應該早有未雨綢繆的措置吧。</p>
<p>我這時的思潮，又向另外一端伸展在我們這樣落後的國家，不僅各重要鐵道交通可能被敵人破壞，而且全國的大小城市都有在敵人轟炸中，化為灰燼的可能，但是這對我們民族的生仔戰爭，是沒有决定的意義的，敵人的破壞，只能使我們前後方的聯絡不能迅速，各種物資的接濟發生困難，這只能使我們對敵人的抵抗力量，不能迅速發揮，决不能阻止或渙散我們抗敵的行動和意志·只要‘一致犧牲’，‘焦土抗戰’能夠長期堅持下去，我們固然大受損失，但敵人亦同樣得不償失。所以只要我們全民族一致奮鬥不懈，我們雖然不能打倒敵人，但是我們有打退敵人驅逐他們出境的最後把握！</p>
<p>渡過了江，列車朝北前進。一個人枯坐車中，翻讀宋史消遣。宋史是漢族亡國史中最悲慘最可痛恨的一幕，所以熱血人士曾有厭讀宋史的心理。眞的，在一個茍且偷安的‘和’字之下，不懂斷送了趙家的天下，而且給千秋萬世遺留下最卑鄙的污點。今日敵人的蠶食華北漢奸的數典忘祖，假如不是相隔了近千年，眞會認為是北宋歷史的翻版。譬如侵略華北園攻平津的敵人，口口聲聲粉飾自己的侵略為‘自衛行動，’又因為自己不能一口鯨吞華北，故利用漢奸組織維持會來暫時維待，慢慢咀嚼下肚，而且還可以表面上堂而皇之的聲明一不為領土。’這種策略與當時金人圍攻汴梁，偽言‘弔民伐罪’，利用張邦昌劉豫等漢奸，冊為楚帝齊帝，使漢奸名義上統治黃河以南區域而自詡一本非貪土亳無差異。汴梁被圍面廟堂和戰未决，以致開門迎敵，二帝被虜。這種情景，按之近情，眞是繪聲繪影，歷壓如在眼前。北宋之亡，决不能盡諉為金人之兵强馬壯，今日華北之危，亦何嘗不是自己子孫的不爭氣！</p>
<p>歷史是不會重演的，宋代遼金人的侵略與二十世紀帝國主義的侵略中國，性質上早巳截然不同。我們六年來飽受敵人侵略的熱血同胞，也但願歷史不至重演。不忍到了今日還會看見有偏安江左時代的南宋那樣的亡國景象。</p>
<p>無盡的遐想，一直到列車駛進蚌埠，才被煩雜的旅客聲音打斷。月臺上有許多荷槍的兵土梭巡着，氣象已與過來的地帶有些異樣。車中上來了許多人，頓時又熱鬧起來，車抵徐州剛剛是下午五點三十分。徐州是隴海津浦兩路交岔點，與鄭州一樣是今日軍事上的後方重鎭，車站上氣象的嚴肅是較蚌埠尤甚了，許多輛救護汽車，正在貨車上起卸。尚有數列北征的鐵篷車，靜靜的躺在過道上，車站上憲兵檢查也極認眞，我一看行車時間表，隴海車要到六點半才開，尚有一個鐘頭的時間，便出站往附近小飯館胡亂吃了紫東西，走上隴海車中。</p>
<p>津浦綫的北上車，自華北日軍挑釁以來，乘客日漸稀少，而南下事則每日擠滿避難的同胞。徐州某報標題云：‘行李蕭條南渡日，傷心北望已無家，’說得多麼凄凉！隴海二等車廂中的情形與剛來的津浦北上車大不相同，半間小小的車廂，擠滿了婦人小孩和軍人。小孩子的啼哭聲和滿地的屎尿，一股臭味觸上鼻尖，但是我一點也不感到厭惡和難堪·因為這些都是衛國將士的妻兒啊！婦人小孩過多了，沒有座位，伴送利車站來的軍人丈夫，滿頭是汗地搬東西，找坐位，一位河北口音的中年旅客，用很嚮亮的喉嚨對佔有一坐席的另一同伴說：‘老鄕！你站起來，讓她們坐吧！反正我們都是中國人，她們是軍人的家眷，他們是去打敵人的！你讓了罷！’軍人都要慷慨走上抗戰的前綫了，這種將妻兒遺送回家的情景，是多麼悲壯呀！</p>
<p>從徐州西行，天色漸漸黑下來，四週的景物是看不見了，但是迎面一列列令人興奮的兵車，不時從車窗邊駛過！車到鄭州，鄭州車站又是那樣的緊張，和車輛的繁多。一個光榮的自信佔據着我的心頭；中國决不會變成南宋！中國要怒吼了！中華民族戰士的目標，不是南渡，而是北指！</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>抗戰的前途</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>我中華民族只有經過了壯烈的民族解放戰爭。才能夠自存。這早巳是全國上下一致的認識了。</p>
<p>因此蘆溝橋的砲聲一響。抗戰的呼聲立卽響徹了全國。我們不怕暴敵的威脅。我們不怕暴敵的進攻。敵人一切凶橫殘暴的手段只有使我全國同胞的團結精神與抗戰决心愈益鞏固而加强。</p>
<p>可是在平南戰事失利以後的今日。我們却見到抗戰的前途上。還浮現着幾許暗雲。第一是近年來對於我國建設很多帮忙的某友邦。在短視的政治家主持之下。深恐遠東的戰事擴大。會使他們的商業利益。蒙受進一步的損害。不惜對侵略者作可恥的讓步。而有勸告中國暫時容忍的企圖。第二是國人中間還有一部分悲觀論者。從平南戰事上。過分敏感到敵人機械化部隊的威力。因而唱着‘戰亦亡不戰亦亡’的論調。</p>
<p>關於第一點。我們認為在這存亡關頭。固然應該審愼運用外交的機能。但是我們的國策却不能因友邦的意旨而輕易轉變。國際的情勢很明顯的在眼前展現着在我國沒有全面抗戰以前。雖是跟中國命運最有利害關係的蘇聯。因為要顧盧到歐洲方面外交關係的綠故。也不能切實地援助中國。如果眞正的全面抗戰發動了。那麼。除了侵略國家以外。全世界的同情一定在我們方面。只要我們不屈不撓。他們自然會盡力援助的。</p>
<p>關於第二點。我們認為在今日的形勢之下。一切失敗主義者的悲觀心理最要不得。二十九軍這次的失利。就為的是一部分高級長官中了這種心理的毒害。因而一再的上了敵人的圈套。我們必須人人抱着堅定的自信心。才能在抗戰中博得最後的勝利。當然這不是說我們可以無視敵人的軍事力量但憑一股旺盛的勇氣。而輕率地向前直衝。我們知道我國陸空軍雖比十年前充實了好幾倍。但是在現代武器的對比上還不及敵人。我們知道我國對於戰爭的凖備還沒有敵人那樣的充分。因此。我們也承認在抗戰上必須小心謹愼。就全面的利害關係來决定戰略。不應輕舉妄動作無謂的犧牲。可是我們却不能不認清我們是被壓迫的民族。近百年來所遭受的暴敵侵凌的慘痛。已經使全民族的抗敵意志統一起來。這一種鐵一般的。意志决不是敵人的飛機大砲所可征服的。東北淪亡以後。當地的義勇軍還摧毀了日軍十餘萬的實力。最近通州保安隊張慶餘部。在虎口之下。居然一天以內。殺死了敵軍二百餘名。這都是顯著的例證。現在我們的抗戰。所憑籍的就是這一種堅强的民族意志。我們卽使武器再差些。我們卽使對於戰爭的凖備再差些。只要抗敵的意志不因一時的挫折而懈怠下去。一定可以獲得最後的勝利。因為在被壓迫民族的抗戰中。正同在革命戰爭中一樣。决勝負的力量在民衆方面比在軍隊方面更大。而武器和戰士的補充在軍民澈底地打成一片的時候是很容易的。</p>
<p>現有全國上下眼見到平津的失陷。正由於東北失陷以後。我們對於侵略者的暫時容忍。大家覺得如果再容忍下去。偏安的局面也决不能保持的。因此在政府領導之下。全國軍民不但呈現着空前的精誠團結的現象。而且大家還都下了莫大的抗敵禦侮的决心。在這時侯。我們希望政府趕速廓清了那些影響着抗敵情緒的暗雲。利用着國民革命的寶貴的教訓。來策動民衆。組織民衆。與侵略的敵人作艱苦的持久的搏門。</p>

<p>［羅馬］據稱、英意兩國業已成立一般諒解、以故英意談判似將於下星期重開、屆時英國駐意大使當已返抵倫敦、與英外部商議、同時意國駐英大使亦為同樣目的、返國商談、然此間消息靈通方面仍持此項見解、以為英意緊張關係之緩和、僅係心理性質、於成立協定以前、尚須經過相當時間、一般人之見解、以為下次國聯會議時談判似尚未能結束云、（七日國民海通電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］關於英意兩國釋嫌言好事、左派‘巴黎廻聲報’頃加以評論云、此間咋有一事可紀、即意國大使賽呂蒂曾訪晤法國國　務總理旭丹、告以英意兩國接近之後、法意兩國亦必隨之接近、關於此層、吾人可向意國聲明一點、即該國善意必可在吾國引起同樣反應、但有數事必須予以澄清、即㊀駐紮西班牙屬巴里利克羣島之意國軍隊、撤退問題、㊁英法兩國在地中海上之交　通自由問題、㊂法意兩國前於一九三五年一月所訂友好條約中關於法屬都尼斯各項條款實施問題、關於阿比西尼亞問題、法國外長台爾博斯、英國外相艾登、雖未能於去年九月間勸導各國承認意國兼併、但本年或可設法使國聯會承認阿國皇帝塞拉西之政權、業已不復仔在、因而不准其代表賡續出席大會、特意國政府屆時若竟提出動議案、要求大會將一九三五年十月七日宣佈意國侵略行動之决議案、予以撤銷、則勢必引起無限度之爭論云、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦瓜分問題</h3>
<p>猶太民族大會　尚未有何决議</p>
<p>⊙蘇黎克　今日當猶太節目、猶太復國運動大會因之未開會議、該會對於瓜分巴力斯坦方案、尚未有何决議、草士曼博士週杪將赴日內瓦、聞將以大會多數出席者對瓜分問題之情感、報告國聯委任統治委員會、據猶太電訊社消息、如大會代表投票表决則約有百分之七十五、贊成昨日勞工團所通過主張、授權執行委員會、與英國談判瓜分建議、以便閘照一切决議案云、復國運動美領袖列浦斯基聲稱、渠信美國代表團將投票贊同韋曼士博士之决議案、渠意諸代表贊同拒絕瓜分任何方式之極端要求者、僅有百分之十、巴力斯坦勞工領袖魯巴旭夫宣稱、瓜分建議含有解决猶太阿拉伯問題之核心、今急宜審愼研究巴力斯坦委任統治委員會之條陳、按幸韋韋之决議案、為授權執行委員會、與英政府談判瓜分問題、惟須該計劃含有根本原則、使巴力斯坦之猶太人、得安享其意中所抱獨立國家之生活、及因此足使各國猶太人問題獲得解决而後可（中央社六日路透電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］法國大使考賓、日前曾以關於巴力斯坦問題照會一件、遞交外務部、頃由外務部錄送殖民事務部備核、法國照會內容係對於巴力斯坦薊分計劃中若干項辦法，認為足以發生流弊、其中最反對之一點、乃係報告書主張在倫敦與巴力斯坦境內設立阿拉伯民族事務處、辦理關於全世界阿拉怕民族一切事務、與現有猶太族事務處無異、此項組織倘經設立、則法國委任統治地、如敘利亞及北非洲法國屬地境內阿拉伯民族之煽動份子、或將收容於該辦事處之內、因而行動將愈益活躍、勢必發生流弊云（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［華盛頓］外國方面傳聞、美國人數千名、業已决定投効中國空軍、國務院頃宣稱、對於此事、並無所知、消息靈通人士則謂、按之美國現行法律、美國人雖不許在本國境內志願投効外國軍隊、但儘可自由離開國境、而赴中國投効、最近美國人士有志願前往西班牙投効者　事後重返美國、從未被判處刑、即此可為明證矣云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>釋‘搬家’</h3>
<p>— 歐陽君毅</p>
<p>‘搬家’不是‘逃難’</p>
<p>最近幾天來，虹口閘北一帶的居民，都紛紛搬家，幾條熱鬧的馬路上，自晨迄暮，各式搬塲車輛，觸目皆是。吳淞江灣自然更是‘十室九空’了，於是引起一部份人的風凉話：‘還沒有正式同日本開戰，已經逃得這個樣子了！’弦外之音，‘中國還能和日本打嗎？’我們不必去調查這些說風凉話的人是否已經住在所謂‘安樂之鄕’的租界內，或者確是個‘頂天立地’的硬漢，至今還住在戰區之內，未動搬家之念，但是這種錯誤的見解是必需更正的，否則，影響所及，等於替漢奸們造謠生事。</p>
<p>每一個上海的居民，他們總不會忘了‘一二八’的教訓吧。日軍之殘忍無道，以此次天津之化為一片焦土，卽在報章上讀到這消息的時侯，恐怕也有談虎色變之國：那末，這些“一二八”時傾家蕩產的居民，要在宮崎失蹤，風聲鶴唳的處境巾安居樂業，自然是强人之所難了：而况搬家已經到了’默許‘的時候。</p>
<p>我們要避免這種無謂的犧性，搬家是無可非議的。</p>
<p>不過有一點是要注意的，‘搬家’不是‘逃難’，那些說風凉話的先生們就是沒有弄清楚這一點。我們之所以搬家，就是要保存一部份力量去和敵人拼命，而不是逃避。││現在已經是‘最後關頭’了，是中華民國的人民，只有向前，不能退後的！</p>
<p>所以在軍事專家們共商國策的時侯對於後方民衆是應該明白地告訴他們怎樣組織，怎樣凖備的，這就是汪精衛先生所說的‘大家要說老實話，大家要負責任’。現在，因為大家注意在前方的戰事，於是忽略了後方的責任，這是希望當局和民衆自己共同合作的，我們要盡每一份所有的力量和敵人相博於戰塲。</p>
<p>‘暴風雨前夕的平靜’大概就要過去了，我們不惜任何犧牲等待着最後的一個命令！</p>
<h3>‘保衛蘆溝橋’公演觀後</h3>
<p>— 李汶</p>
<p>㊀劇本</p>
<p>蘆構橋畔敵人的砲火，震顫了每一個不願意做奴隸中國同胞的心！最高軍事領袖向全國民衆鋼鐵般的堅决表示：最後關頭已到，只有抗戰到底！興奮了堅强了每一個不願意做奴隸中國同胞的意志和認織！</p>
<p>中國，你是在怒吼了！</p>
<p>站在國防文化前綫的上海戲劇界，首先動員了廣大的劇作者，廣大的劇人，讓含有最尖銳性的國防劇—保衛蘆溝橋！—在集體創作下完成其劇本，而很迅速的在蓬萊大戲院由各劇團共同參加而演出了。</p>
<p>是的，我們要保衛蘆溝橋！收復失地！</p>
<p>劇本是住三個部分合成的，每個部分均可單獨演出。參加創作過程的，共有二十六人。這是我國戲劇界未有的盛事！</p>
<p>誠然，若就純藝術的見地來觀察這個劇本，不合於一些高級紳士脾胃的地方是很多的，比如，它就完全缺乏‘含蓄’！‘鋒芒太露’，因之，租界雖是我們的土地而不能在租界內演出，只得局限於城內蓬萊戲院一隅了。然而正因它這樣，它是一顆擲向民衆深處的爆烈彈，猛烈地激動每一個觀衆的神經’沸騰他們的熱血，大家起來，向敵人衝去！</p>
<p>就劇本看，全劇刺激性最大的部分，是第二部，差不多是血和淚的交流，凝成一輻生死鬭爭的圖畫，單就劇本看時就有這樣的感覺。這裹，士兵和下級軍官的忠勇為國，上層官僚的投降乞和醜態，廣大民衆與兵士聯成一氣為民族生存而誓死殺敵，許多複雜的眞實，都以最激動人的塲面與手法而給以赤露了。其次是第一部，從一個平靜的農村反映出‘暴風雨的前夕’，情緒逐步提升，只是到後面大概要顧及與第二部的聯繫關係罷，以中國乓的出現作結，原來提起的高潮—鬼子的橫行—頓然折向另一方面發展了，不夠給人以更大的刺激。第三部要算差一點，戲的發展欠緊密，寫全民抗戰，用這種塲面，是否是最好的方法，似乎還可討論一下，戲不儘深刻，是它的缺點。</p>
<p>對於劇本的見解是如此，但在演出上，却並不盡如看劇本所得到的效果一樣。</p>
<p>（二）演出　　台生</p>
<p>在瘋狂，興奮，熱烈的空氣裏，三幕戲可以説没有一幕不堅固地抓住觀衆的。我們聽見台上的吼聲，我們也聽見台下的吼聲，這種瘋樣熱烈的情緒，正十二萬分地表現了中國民衆要求抗戰的决心！</p>
<p>第一部“暴風雨的前夕”—那個茶棚裏，鬼子兵的演習，糟塌了蘆溝橋莊稼的豆子和農田，男子婦人小孩都被鬼子兵所槍殺了，這一幕戲，我只想舉出兩點，希望能改衣一下：（一）當日本兵在茶館中出現以後，他們拆除茶棚，鞭抽丁大頭，所有農民都只靜默地看着日兵的暴躁，等日兵走了以後，喊得最嚮的劉得標才又喊起來：“我們要殺鬼子兵去！”觀衆這時候反而笑了。這個地方，我以爲劇本應當更改一下，否則所收的效果太壞；第二，二十九路軍開到，兵士們的歌唱，軍號，戰鼓等等效果，都顯得不熱烈，不緊張。</p>
<p>第二部“蘆溝橋是我們的墳墓”—劇本對於“於從命令”“猶豫未决”的現狀，抓得很緊，但抗戰開始以後，槍聲，機槍聲，手溜彈的燄火等的應嚮效果太差。</p>
<p>第三部“全國的抗戰”—這應當是全劇的頂點，演員的位置雖然紛亂一點，但因爲情都很熱烈，所得到的效果非常的好。尤其是高呼“保衛蘆溝橋”與抗戰的口號當中，整個戲院的人是瘋了。</p>
<p>當北平，天津，蘆溝橋，宛平完全已陷落，整個中國全面的抗戰即將開始的時候，“保衛蘆溝橋”的演出，給了我們一服刺激的興奮劑。</p>

<h3>Military and Civilian Retreat of Chinese and Japanese from Hankou by Order</h3>
<p>All Japanese Shops, Factories, and Banks Closed; Japanese Warships to Leave Hankou in Upper Yangtze This Afternoon; Our Police to Take Over Japanese Concession This Morning</p>
<p>[Hankou] Japanese Consul-General Matsudaira, upon receiving orders from Tokyo, will withdraw all Japanese troops and expatriates stationed in Hankou back to their country. After consultations with our authorities, it was decided that over 1,000 marines and 500-600 expatriates from the five warships berthed in Hankou would be evacuated in stages on the 7th and 8th. Only about 100 staff members and police officers from the five consulates in Hankou, Chongqing, Yichang, Shashi, and Changsha will remain. At 3 PM on the 7th, the warships Setoda and Hira will escort the two ships, Fengyang and Ruiyang, carrying all Japanese expatriates to Shanghai. The three warships, Yeyama, Hotsu, and Away, are scheduled to carry all Japanese soldiers eastward at 11 AM on the 8th. The Japanese concession is currently still under martial law, with Japanese police maintaining order within the concession and Chinese police maintaining order outside. Chinese people are temporarily prohibited from entering the concession and from taking items out. Japanese people will completely disarm in Hankou after the afternoon of the 8th. Consulate staff will request our assistance for protection. One ship, Yueyang Maru, will remain in Hankou for use. Furthermore, after the Taian Cotton Mill suspends operations, one month's salary will be paid to workers before dissolution. The goods stored by Nisshin Kisen Kaisha will be protected by us. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to diplomatic circles, the acting Japanese Consul-General in Hankou, Matsudaira, visited Hankou Mayor Wu Guozhen at 12 AM on the 6th and stated that Japanese expatriates in Hankou had received orders from their government to return to their country. Consulate staff, however, will remain in Hankou to work, requesting the Hankou Municipal Government to provide protection. The Japanese concession in Hankou will be entrusted to the Hankou Municipal Government for management. A total of five Japanese warships berthed in Hankou are scheduled to depart two on the 7th and two on the 8th. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hankou] The Japanese consulate in Hankou received orders from the Japanese government on the evening of the 6th to withdraw all stationed navy and expatriates. Acting Japanese Consul-General Matsudaira notified our Municipal Government Police Department on the morning of the 7th, and Wu Guozhen and Chen Xizeng went to negotiate. After consultation with Matsudaira, it was decided that after the Japanese troops withdraw, the security within the Japanese concession would be maintained jointly by our police, who will register names, and Japanese police personnel. Most of the Japanese marines and military supplies were successively loaded onto warships on the afternoon of the 7th. Among them, three warships already departed from Hankou in the afternoon of the 7th and sailed downstream. The other two ships, Yeyama Maru, etc., are scheduled to carry the remaining marines and expatriates away on the morning of the 8th. Our police are scheduled to enter the Japanese concession at 8 AM on the morning of the 8th to assist the Japanese police in maintaining everything. The periphery of the concession was already garrisoned by us at 1 PM on the 7th. Acting Japanese Consul Matsumoto, Deputy Consul Shirai, over 20 Japanese police officers from the police station, and a small number of Japanese businessmen responsible for settling debts at Japanese trading companies and factories will remain temporarily. Therefore, the concession restricts the entry and exit of foreigners to avoid causing trouble. As for Japanese shops, factories, and banks outside the concession, they were all closed on the 7th. The indoor belongings are entrusted to others by Japanese businessmen for safekeeping. Our police are only responsible for maintaining order outdoors. The Chinese workers of the Japanese Taian Cotton Mill were dismissed on the afternoon of the 7th after receiving 20 days' wages. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Does Not Abandon Concessions</h3>
<p>Administrative Transfer is a Temporary Measure; It Will be Abolished After the North China Incident is Resolved</p>
<p>[Hankou] The Chinese authorities here have taken over the administration of the Japanese concession. However, Japanese sailors are still guarding it fully armed. It is said that this transfer of administration is only a temporary measure and that it will be abolished after the North China "Incident" is resolved. Therefore, the impression of some that Japan has abandoned the Japanese concession in Hankou is actually inaccurate. This afternoon, a Reuters reporter entered the Japanese concession for inspection. When entering the concession, he was stopped by Japanese soldiers with bayonets and ordered to halt. However, after explanation, he was allowed to pass. The situation within the concession is still peaceful. However, transport vehicles are fully loaded with furniture and belongings, and the traffic is very busy. Other than those moving furniture, there are no other pedestrians on the road. The tension between China and Japan is evident in the suspension of all business and the cancellation of all contracts. (7th Reuters Dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Mutually Agreed Upon Measures</h3>
<p>A Total of Five Items Have Been Implemented One by One; Japanese Consulate Staff, etc., Will Remain in Hankou Temporarily</p>
<p>[Hankou] Official announcement at 9 PM on the 7th: At 11:30 PM on the evening of the 6th, acting Japanese Consul-General Matsudaira visited Mayor Wu and stated that all Japanese expatriates stationed in Hankou would return to their country on the 7th according to orders from Tokyo. The five Japanese warships currently berthed in Hankou will have three of them escort the expatriates downstream. The remaining navy will also be withdrawn entirely on the 8th. However, Japanese consulate staff will remain in Hankou temporarily, and it was agreed that the consulate and concession would be protected by police dispatched by us. As of 10:30 AM on the morning of the 7th, Mayor Wu, accompanied by Police Chief Chen Xizeng, visited acting Japanese Consul-General Matsudaira to continue discussions on the withdrawal of the Japanese navy. The following was agreed upon: ① When the navy withdraws on the morning of the 7th, our side will cut off traffic around the concession to avoid disputes. ② Japanese consulate and concession police personnel will not withdraw temporarily, with a total number of about 100 people, including personnel from the Chongqing, Changsha, Yichang, and Shashi consulates. ③ Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's Yueyang Maru will remain in Hankou temporarily for the use of consulate staff when they withdraw. ④ After the navy withdraws, our side will dispatch 30 police officers to assist the Japanese police in maintaining order within the concession. ⑤ Japanese consulate staff must await the final orders from Tokyo before withdrawing again. At that time, the Japanese consul will write to the Municipal Government requesting the safekeeping of the concession. The measures discussed have now been implemented in order. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Joint Statement by Shanghai Japanese Officials</h3>
<p>In Accordance with the Government's Policy of Non-Expansion, Orders to Withdraw to Avoid Incidents</p>
<p>(Local News) The Japanese authorities in Shanghai have made the following statement regarding the withdrawal of Japanese expatriates from Hankou: Since the outbreak of the North China Incident, the situation in Hankou has become increasingly tense. Our acting Consul-General in Hankou requested instructions from the home government. In view of the overall situation between Japan and China and adhering to the government's policy of not expanding the situation, orders were given to withdraw all expatriates in order to avoid incidents. However, the Consul in Hankou is to consult with local Chinese officials to find ways to protect the concession and other national and public property, as well as the private property of expatriates. Because of this necessity, he was ordered to remain in the area temporarily. In addition, the Embassy in China and the Consul-General in Hankou have separately requested assistance from Nanjing and local officials. The entire withdrawal of Japanese expatriates from Hankou will be the first step. Therefore, there are various speculations about the aftermath of the Japanese concession. However, as in the case of Chongqing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places with Japanese concessions, Chinese officials were requested to fully protect the concessions when Japanese expatriates withdrew. Therefore, the preservation of the Japanese concession in Hankou should be considered unproblematic. (7th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Local Authorities Protect Japanese Expatriates</h3>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Thugs and Vagrants from Entering the Concession; A Considerable Curfew Still Enforced Last Night</p>
<p>[Hankou] The Wuhan Garrison Command, upon learning on the 7th that Japanese warships and expatriates were about to withdraw, immediately strictly prohibited thugs and vagrants from entering the Japanese concession. On the evening of the 7th, a considerable curfew was enforced near the Japanese concession, and all officers and soldiers of each department were notified that they must not enter the Japanese concession and the residences and gardens of Japanese expatriates outside the concession. For the remaining Japanese expatriates, they must be effectively protected, and there must be no inappropriate behavior whatsoever. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hankou Atmosphere Relaxes</h3>
<p>[Hankou] After news of the voluntary withdrawal of Japanese navy and expatriates stationed in Hankou spread, the atmosphere in the city suddenly eased. Six hundred Japanese expatriates left Hankou on the afternoon of the 7th on the Ruiyang and Yiyang ships. Part of the marines then escorted them aboard the Hira and Rota warships.

<p>[Nanjing] Liu Xiang, accompanied by Deng Hanxiang, Liu Hangchen, etc., flew from Chongqing on the morning of the 7th and arrived in Nanjing at 3:30 PM, where he immediately went to see central government officials. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Liu Xiang, Director of the Sichuan-Kangding Pacification Headquarters, flew from Chengdu to Nanjing by plane on the 7th. Those accompanying him included Sichuan Provincial Government Secretary-General Deng Hanxiang, Finance Director Liu Hangchen, Committee Members Gan Xuyong and Lu Zuofu, and Military Training Director Yang Jihui and Garrison Commander Yu Rujun. Those who went to the airport to welcome them included Chiang Kai-shek's representative Qian Dajun, as well as He Yingqin, Wu Dingchang, Zhang Qun, Lu Chao, Qin Fen (representative of Soong Tzu-wen), Finance Vice Minister Xu Kan, Legislative Committee members Chen Changheng and Lu Zhonglin, Supervisory Committee member Xie Wuliang, and dozens of fellow Sichuanese in Beijing. Although Liu was ill, his spirit was very good. After getting off the plane, he shook hands with each of the welcomers to express his thanks and then boarded a car to the Beijing office of the Sichuan-Kangding Pacification Headquarters to rest. At 6 PM, he paid his respects to Chairman Chiang to report on everything. At the airport, he issued a written statement to reporters as follows: This time, I am entering Beijing despite my illness with the aim of paying my respects to Chairman Chiang and the central government authorities, reporting on the implementation of military reorganization, and requesting instructions on all matters related to rear defense during the national crisis. Recently, the national crisis has become serious and has reached the final juncture. A full-scale war of resistance is inevitable. Planning countermeasures is the prerogative of the central government. In addition to respectfully listening to the instructions of Chairman Chiang and the heads of the central government, I will also contribute as much as possible any insights I may have for their adoption. The nation and the race have reached the final juncture, and the only way out is resistance. The national people are full of enthusiasm and have fully demonstrated the spirit of unity and common dedication to the national crisis. Adversity and the country are about to be clearly verified. Although the enemy is strong and violent, we will strive for the final victory. Sichuan is the rear defense of the country, and Sichuan Province will bear a great responsibility in the future. At present, the reorganization of the army has been completed, and manpower and financial resources can all be contributed to the country. My personal intention in coming here is to make this clear, to make all preparations under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, to relieve the central government's worries, and to comfort the hopes of the people. However, Sichuan and Kangding have just gotten on track, and the construction of various projects has just been planned, and the foundation is not yet solid. In terms of resources, there is much that needs to be done in terms of personnel. Since the people of the country have recognized the importance of rear defense, it is earnestly hoped that everyone will work together to assist. In particular, it is hoped that the financial community will concentrate resources on production and development to replenish material resources so that Sichuan can truly be the shield for the nation's struggle. Then the country and the local area will be fortunate. Because my responsibilities are very heavy, I do not dare to cherish my sick body and am entering Beijing to ask for instructions. I am honored to have your visit and welcome, which I do not dare to accept. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>[Chengdu] Liu Xiang, accompanied by Deng Hanxiang, Gan Xuyong, Yang Fangyu, and attendants, flew east to Beijing by China National Aviation Corporation plane from Chengdu at 7 AM on the morning of the 7th. Liu Hangchen and Lu Zuofu will accompany him on the same plane later.

After arriving at the airport, he exchanged pleasantries with the well-wishers and discussed the issue of military reorganization with the three army commanders, Tang Shizun, Pan Wenhua, and Wang Zanshu. It was generally agreed that the first step in military reorganization had been completed, and the list of unit designations would be announced on the 10th, instructing Tang Shizun and others to implement it accordingly. According to Liu's remarks before his departure, this time, he is entering Beijing despite his illness to request instructions, which is of great importance. If he has any insights, he should contribute them to the central government for their adoption. In recent years, the national crisis has become increasingly serious, and the supreme leader has always given clear instructions on the great righteousness of resisting aggression and dying for the country. Having been in the military for a long time, I believe that in today's situation, there is no other way than resistance. Sichuan is a key rear defense area, and in the long-term war of resistance in the future, Sichuan should bear the heavy responsibility of long-term support. All manpower and material resources can be contributed to the country. This time, I plan to express this intention sincerely. Despite my sick body and the hot weather, I am traveling quickly, and I am extremely grateful for the enthusiastic farewell from all walks of life. The patriotism and anti-Japanese enthusiasm of colleagues and the public will definitely be relayed to the central government, and I will definitely not disappoint expectations.

<h3>Shen Junru and Others Visit Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan</h3>
<p>Discussing National Salvation Policies with Feng and Yan; Shen and Others Arrive in Shanghai by Night Train</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Shen Junru and others had previously met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. On the morning of the 7th, at 6:00 AM, they met with Vice Chairman Feng Yuxiang to discuss national salvation policies. Feng also invited them to breakfast. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Shen and others met with Vice Chairman Yan Xishan and had extensive discussions. It is reported that Shen Junru, Li Gongpu, and Zhang Naiqi took the night train back to Shanghai on the 7th and will return to Nanjing on the morning of the 9th. Chairman Chiang plans to meet with all seven members of Shen's group for a second time on the 9th or 10th, following his previous conversation with Shen Junru alone. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Shen Junru, Li Gongpu, and Zhang Naiqi took the night train to Shanghai on the 7th, leaving Zou Taofen, Wang Zao Shi, Sha Qianli, and Shi Liang in Nanjing to continue meeting and talking with various authorities. Shen and others expressed that they were deeply moved by Mr. Chiang's Lushan speech while in prison and immediately sent a telegram expressing their enthusiasm. After being released from prison, they came to Nanjing to meet with party, government, and military authorities. Everyone expressed complete agreement on the determination to resist Japan. As for the strategic grasp of time and space, it should be the government's responsibility to make the most appropriate design. Furthermore, the leaders of the party, government, and military have expressed that they will address domestic issues with generosity, kindness, frankness, and directness, which aligns with the hopes of the national public. It can be said that the leadership and the people are of one mind. It is deeply believed that party and government workers in various regions will be able to uphold this spirit, actively lead the people, so that every patriotic person can contribute their sincerity and make the greatest effort for the country, to build a people's bulwark as strong as steel, to guarantee the final victory of the national war. At present, the people's work should be unified under unified leadership and should be more specific and more composed. This is undoubtedly not a problem, but it must be demonstrated concretely and calmly under national mobilization and in active action. Therefore, speaking of unified leadership, it cannot rely solely on a few documents and a few organizations, but requires widespread and deep mobilization. Speaking of composure, it is definitely not inaction or depression, but rather planned and methodical action. Patriotic sincerity is common to all. Currently, in every alley, in every corner of the house, in every village boat, there are people who are enthusiastic about saving the country but lack the means. This is a source of suffering and grief for the people and a great loss for the country. Mobilizing them is currently an extremely arduous task. It is hoped that the leaders will make efforts. Finally, regarding the meaning of the word "composure," we believe that it is essential that, today, when the government has expressed its great determination, we, the people, must conduct careful reviews and practical efforts on how to contribute ourselves and on individual issues of future mobilization. As for the war process, we should of course think hard everywhere, but we must absolutely not be afraid of losing battles. Winning requires continued fighting, and losing also requires continued fighting. Only then can we achieve final victory. Therefore, the people must not be overly concerned with temporary victories or accidental gains and losses in the war, but only remember the three words "fight to the end." Soldiers should be rewarded for winning battles, and especially need to be comforted for losing battles. Whoever can fight to the end is a national hero and should not be despised for a temporary defeat but should have their achievements calculated on the day of final victory. This is what we want to say today. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>En Route Northward</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Ximin</p>
<p>At 11:30 PM on July 31st, I, the reporter, took a rickshaw from my residence in Shanghai, passing through the dazzling neon lights, and rows of cars silently waiting along the roadside for their owners who were reveling in the dance halls. In the vicinity of the Racecourse, I quietly boarded the Shanghai-Peiping through train northward.</p>
<p>Arriving at the ticket counter, I inquired about the fare and sleeper to Zhengzhou via the Longhai Railway from Xuzhou. A middle-aged passenger squeezed in beside me and asked the ticket clerk where the Shanghai-Peiping through train went. The ticket clerk replied, "Jinan." "Jinan! Wasn't it still going to Cangzhou yesterday? Why has the route been shortened so quickly?" In surprise, I couldn't help but blurt out these words. The thin ticket clerk sitting at the ticket counter glanced at me without saying a word, only shaking his head. The expression on his face was filled with deep melancholy! My heart was completely moved by his sorrowful emotions. But what stirred in my heart was not passive sorrow, but a full surge of grief and courage.</p>
<p>The locomotive of the Shanghai-Peiping train emitted a long roar, and the train began to crawl forward. With a surge of heroic passion, I allowed the train to carry me away, racing through the dark and silent wilderness. A second-class compartment that could accommodate four passengers contained only me. Loneliness tightly surrounded me. Fortunately, I was tired after a long day, and I fell into a daze after the train arrived in Kunshan.</p>
<p>The next day, I woke up to broad daylight. Looking out of the train window, I saw the beautiful and majestic scenery of Qixia Mountain flashing by. It turned out that the train was approaching Nanjing. I yawned and stared intently at the peaks of Qixia Mountain flashing past, my heart filled with many emotions. I couldn't help but pray silently: "Qixia Mountain! I hope you are an iron wall defending the capital, blocking the Hu barbarians from invading the Yangtze River!"</p>
<p>When the train arrived in Xiaguan, there were not many passengers getting on or off. I still occupied a compartment by myself. I bought a copy of the Central Daily News from a newspaper vendor. The large headlines of the Japanese bombing of Tianjin and Baoding, with extremely heavy casualties, pierced my eyes. As I read Chairman Wang Jingwei's speech in Lushan, sentence by sentence, I came to the section on national unity and sacrifice, leaving not a single puppet seed. At that moment, the train had just entered the Yangtze River ferry, preparing to cross the river. In the past, before the ferries were added, crossing the river was an extremely troublesome matter for travelers. Now, of course, it is much more convenient, but the time delay cannot be compared to having a railway bridge. As the train was carried by the ferry in the middle of the river, I looked at the surrounding river water and the scenery on both banks, and suddenly, these two questions popped into my mind. If a large-scale war between China and Japan officially breaks out, with the enemy's strong air force, it would probably be easy to destroy our country's railway transportation. At that time, I'm afraid the Yangtze River ferry wouldn't be as stable as it is today, able to provide connecting transportation between the north and south banks of the Yangtze River. This is not unfounded anxiety. Given that the enemy is scheming to exploit us in every way possible, it is very likely. For the sake of convenience and security of military transportation, the government authorities should have contingency measures prepared early on.</p>
<p>At this time, my thoughts extended to another point. In a backward country like ours, not only could important railway communications be destroyed by the enemy, but all large and small cities across the country could be reduced to ashes in enemy bombing. But this has no decisive significance for our nation's war of survival. The enemy's destruction can only prevent us from quickly connecting the front and rear, and difficulties will arise in the supply of various materials. This can only prevent us from quickly exerting our resistance against the enemy, but it can never stop or dissolve our determination and will to resist. As long as 'unified sacrifice' and 'scorched earth resistance' can be maintained for a long time, we will suffer great losses, but the enemy will similarly suffer losses that outweigh their gains. Therefore, as long as our entire nation fights unremittingly, we may not be able to defeat the enemy, but we have the final certainty of repelling the enemy and driving them out of our borders!</p>
<p>After crossing the river, the train headed north. Sitting alone in the car, I turned to the "History of the Song Dynasty" for entertainment. The History of the Song Dynasty is the most tragic and hateful scene in the history of the demise of the Han Chinese, so people of ardent blood have a psychological aversion to reading it. Indeed, under a compromising "peace" character, Zhao's dynasty was unknowingly ruined, and the most despicable stain was left behind for thousands of years. Today, the enemy's piecemeal encroachment on North China and the traitors' denial of their ancestors, if it were not separated by nearly a thousand years, would really be considered a remake of the history of the Northern Song Dynasty. For example, the enemies who invaded North China and attacked Peiping and Tianjin, repeatedly whitewashed their aggression as "self-defense actions," and because they could not swallow North China in one gulp, they used traitorous organizations like the Maintenance Association to temporarily maintain the situation, slowly chewing it into their stomach, and even declaring on the surface with great fanfare that they "do not seek territory." This kind of strategy is exactly the same as when the Jin people besieged Bianliang, falsely claiming to "condemn the guilty and comfort the people," using traitors like Zhang Bangchang and Liu Yu, and conferring them as Emperors of Chu and Emperors of Qi, allowing the traitors to nominally rule the area south of the Yellow River while boasting that they are not greedy for land. When Bianliang was besieged, the court was undecided on war and peace, leading to opening the gates to welcome the enemy, and the two emperors were captured. This situation, comparing it to recent events, is truly vivid and lifelike, as if it were right before our eyes. The demise of the Northern Song Dynasty cannot be entirely blamed on the strength of the Jin people's army. Today, the crisis in North China is also due to the lack of ambition of our own descendants!</p>
<p>History will not repeat itself. The Liao and Jin people's invasion of the Song Dynasty and the 20th-century imperialist invasion of China are fundamentally different in nature. We, the compatriots who have endured the enemy's aggression for six years, can only hope that history will not repeat itself. I cannot bear to see the demise of the country like the Southern Song Dynasty in the era of partial peace in Jiangzuo.</p>
<p>Endless reveries continued until the train pulled into Bengbu, where I was interrupted by the chaotic voices of the passengers. There were many soldiers with guns patrolling on the platform, and the atmosphere was somewhat different from the areas we had passed through. Many people got on the train, and it suddenly became lively again. The train arrived in Xuzhou at exactly 5:30 PM. Xuzhou is the intersection of the Longhai and Jinpu Railways, and like Zhengzhou, it is an important rear base for military affairs today. The solemn atmosphere at the station was even more intense than in Bengbu. Many ambulances were being unloaded from freight cars. There were also several rows of northward-bound iron-covered cars lying quietly in the passageway. The military police's inspection at the station was also extremely serious. I looked at the train schedule and saw that the Longhai train would not depart until 6:30 PM, so I had an hour to go out of the station and hastily ate something at a nearby small restaurant before getting on the Longhai train.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army provoked in North China, the number of passengers on the northbound Jinpu Line has gradually decreased, while the southbound lanes are packed with compatriots seeking refuge every day. A Xuzhou newspaper headline read: 'Luggage desolate, crossing the river south; heartbreakingly looking north, there is no home.' How desolate! The situation in the second-class carriage of the Longhai Line was very different from the northbound train of the Jinpu Line. Half of the small carriage was filled with women, children, and soldiers. The crying of children and the smell of feces and urine filled the air, but I didn't feel disgusted or embarrassed at all, because these are the wives and children of the soldiers defending the country! There were too many women and children, and there were no seats. The soldier husbands who were escorting them to the station were sweating profusely, carrying things and looking for seats. A middle-aged passenger with a Hebei accent said to another companion who was occupying a seat in a very loud voice: 'Old fellow! Stand up and let them sit! Anyway, we are all Chinese. They are the family members of soldiers. They are going to fight the enemy! Give them your seat!' The soldiers are all going to the front lines of the war of resistance with generosity. What a tragic scene it is to send their wives and children home!</p>
<p>Traveling west from Xuzhou, the sky gradually darkened, and the surrounding scenery could not be seen. But rows of exciting troop trains passed by the train window from time to time! When the train arrived in Zhengzhou, the Zhengzhou station was just as tense and with just as many vehicles. A glorious confidence occupied my heart: China will never become the Southern Song Dynasty! China is about to roar! The goal of the Chinese national warriors is not to cross the river south, but to point north!</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Future of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Only through a glorious national liberation war can our Chinese nation survive. This is already a consensus among the people from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Therefore, as soon as the sound of cannons at Lugou Bridge was heard, the call for resistance resounded throughout the country. We are not afraid of the enemy's threats. We are not afraid of the enemy's attacks. All the enemy's ferocious and brutal methods will only make the unity and determination of the people across the country more consolidated and strengthened.</p>
<p>But today, after the defeat of the Pingjin War, we see that there are still some dark clouds appearing in the future of the War of Resistance. First, a certain friendly country that has helped our country's construction a lot in recent years, under the control of short-sighted politicians, is deeply afraid that the expansion of the war in the Far East will cause further damage to their commercial interests and does not hesitate to make shameful concessions to the aggressor and attempt to advise China to be patient temporarily. Second, there is still a group of pessimists among the Chinese people who are overly sensitive to the power of the enemy's mechanized troops from the Pingjin War and therefore sing the tune of "fighting will lead to destruction, and not fighting will also lead to destruction."</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, we believe that in this critical moment of survival, we should carefully use diplomatic functions. But our national policy cannot be easily changed due to the intentions of friendly countries. The international situation is clearly unfolding before us. Before China's comprehensive war of resistance, even the Soviet Union, which is most closely related to China's fate, cannot effectively assist China because it must consider its diplomatic relations in Europe. If a real all-out war of resistance is launched, then, except for the aggressor countries, the sympathy of the whole world will definitely be on our side. As long as we are unyielding, they will naturally do their best to help us.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, we believe that under the current situation, the pessimistic psychology of all defeatists is the most undesirable. The Twenty-Ninth Army's defeat this time was due to the poisoning of some senior officers by this psychology, which led to them repeatedly falling into the enemy's trap. We must all have a firm confidence in order to win the final victory in the War of Resistance. Of course, this is not to say that we can ignore the enemy's military strength and rely solely on a surge of courage to rush forward recklessly. We know that although our army and air force are several times stronger than they were ten years ago, they are still inferior to the enemy in terms of modern weapons. We know that our preparations for war are not as adequate as the enemy's. Therefore, we also admit that we must be careful and prudent in the War of Resistance and decide on a strategy based on overall interests, and we should not act rashly and make unnecessary sacrifices. But we cannot fail to recognize that we are an oppressed nation. The tragic pain of the enemy's aggression over the past century has unified the entire nation's will to resist the enemy. This kind of iron will cannot be conquered by the enemy's planes and cannons. After the loss of the Northeast, the local volunteer army destroyed more than 100,000 of the Japanese army's strength. Recently, Zhang Qingyu's unit of the Tongzhou Security Force killed more than 200 enemy soldiers in one day under the enemy's nose. These are all clear examples. What our War of Resistance relies on now is this kind of strong national will. Even if our weapons are worse, even if our preparations for war are worse, as long as the will to resist the enemy does not slacken due to temporary setbacks, we will definitely achieve the final victory. Because in the war of resistance of the oppressed nations, as in the revolutionary war, the force that determines victory or defeat lies more on the people's side than on the army side. The replenishment of weapons and soldiers is very easy when the military and civilians are thoroughly united.</p>
<p>Now the whole country sees the loss of Pingjin, precisely because after the loss of the Northeast, we temporarily tolerated the aggressors. Everyone feels that if we tolerate it any further, the situation of partial peace will never be maintained. Therefore, under the leadership of the government, not only does the entire army and people present an unprecedented phenomenon of unity, but everyone has also made the greatest determination to resist the enemy and defend against insults. At this time, we hope that the government will quickly clear up those dark clouds that are affecting the mood of resistance and use the valuable lessons of the National Revolution to motivate the people, organize the people, and engage in a difficult and sustained struggle with the invading enemy.</p>

<h3>French Poet and Diplomat Writes Highly Praising Our Strong Resistance</h3>
<p>Peiping Was Originally Our Political Center and Must Be Recovered The Japanese Army's Desire to Seize Economic Power Will Also Be Difficult to Achieve</p>
<p>[Paris] Claude, a French man of the times, former ambassador to Japan and the United States, and former staff member of the Chinese embassy, recently published an article in the right-wing Figaro newspaper, commenting on the Sino-Japanese dispute. Japan's approach to China is "using both military and political means" and wants to seize northern China before it stops. If we draw a straight line on the Asian continent, starting from northern China, there will be a day when we can follow this straight line from Tianjin through Mongolia to Siberia...As for the place of Peiping, politically speaking, it was originally the capital of China, and geographically speaking, it is located in a corner. It has been the political center of China for a long time. Although it has been moved several times in the past, it will eventually be able to restore its status as the capital. The intention of the invading country is to use this claimed position to better scheme'. It is as if those who claim hegemony in China will inevitably encounter great obstacles, especially since Chinese culture and spirit are uniformly aligned and cannot be broken. 'Japan will inevitably suffer invisible resistance, and to overcome this resistance, it will not be successful without extremely original forces and extremely large wars. Moreover, Japan's reliance on military superiority to monopolize China economically will inevitably be opposed by the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and all countries in the world. In short, anyone who has interacted with the Chinese people knows the Chinese people's sharp personality and their great passive resistance. In the future, if all countries in the world support them in unison, the strength of their resistance to aggression will be even more self-evident,' he said.

<h3>Fuzhou Business Community's Anti-Smuggling Movement</h3>
<p>All Businesses Given a Deadline to Eliminate Smuggled Goods; No More Smuggling After Elimination</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Among the smuggled goods sold in the city's markets, the silk and cloth industry has the most, followed by the Jiangsu and Guangdong goods industry, and then the dried fruit industry. Most of these goods come from Taiwan and Hong Kong. The silk and cloth industry has publicly agreed to ban the sale of smuggled goods since July. The existing smuggled goods, worth about ten thousand yuan, have been gathered together and are being sold at discounted prices. They have now been eliminated. All silk and cloth shops have hung signs in their shops stating that they do not sell smuggled goods. The Jiangsu and Guangdong Goods Association also decided on July 37th to stop selling smuggled goods. However, due to the large variety and trivial nature of the goods in this industry, in order to thoroughly eliminate smuggling, a notice has been issued to all warehouses and shops to list and submit an evaluation form for all old smuggled goods, regardless of quantity, within seven days for registration, so that personnel can be dispatched to inspect and seal them, and then determine how to handle them. The dried fruit industry, seeing the silk and cloth industry implementing the elimination of smuggled goods and the Jiangsu and Guangdong goods industry starting to register smuggled goods, merchants in this industry did not want to be left behind and also gathered on the 2nd to discuss registering old smuggled goods in order to eliminate them within a deadline. In the future, direct purchasers will no longer purchase new smuggled goods, and retail stores will no longer sell new smuggled goods. Penalties have also been agreed upon. If direct purchasers purchase new smuggled goods in the future, they will be fined 500 yuan. Retail stores selling new smuggled goods will be fined 300 yuan. Rewards for informants will be 30%. The Steamship Association on the upper reaches of the Min River also held a meeting on the 2nd and decided to refuse to transport smuggled goods and printed slogans to be posted on various steamships to show their determination. It has been found that this anti-smuggling movement by various merchant guilds is completely voluntary. However, the Japanese consul in Fuzhou mistakenly believed that the merchants' refusal to sell smuggled goods was a boycott of Japanese goods and inquired with the provincial government about the situation. After the authorities explained, there were no further objections. (4th)</p>
<h3>Land Subsidence in Nanxia Sixing Port, Changshu County</h3>
<p>Over Ten Thousand Mu of Fields Suddenly Become a Vast Ocean; Hundreds of Residents Drowned</p>
<p>Changshu Correspondence: A hurricane struck here on the 4th, and all rural telephone lines were cut, causing communication to be cut off. At noon on the 5th, the county government received a special report that the Nanxia West and Port area of Shazhou City was flooded by the hurricane tide and had subsided, inundating over 8,000 mu of land and drowning hundreds of nearby residents, resulting in losses of over 200,000 yuan, the worst in twenty years. (According to reports, the area was once attacked by river tides in June of the fourth year of the Republic, killing and injuring hundreds of farmers.) The Seventh District of Shazhou City was originally formed by sand beaches, which were enclosed to become land. It has only been two hundred years. Every time a hurricane arises, the dikes in this area are at risk. This hurricane struck on the night of the 2nd, and on the night of the 3rd, the situation was even worse. At about 11 pm on the night of the 3rd, heavy rain was added, and the river tide increased sharply, landing ashore and attacking the Nanxia area of Sixing Port. The waves surged and suddenly rose to a height of over ten feet. After rushing in through a large breach, residents were caught in their sleep without being able to escape when attacked from inside and outside. The number of drowned people reached hundreds. Houses and livestock were swept away by the waves. Upon hearing the news, Nanfeng Town, five miles away from the riverbank, immediately gathered the crowd in the middle of the night amidst strong winds and heavy rain and set up ways to rescue them. After mobilizing everyone, sandbags were used to block and defend, temporarily preserving peace. However, in the Sixing Port Nanxia Changtong Port area, more than 8,000 mu of land have been occupied. On the morning of the 5th, more than 60 bodies were found near Nanfeng Town, the most tragic being the Cai Jingxiu family of ten farmers who were all drowned. At this moment, bodies and miscellaneous utensils are still floating along the beach, and the town mayor and others are salvaging them. District Chief Liu Jianbai happened to be in the city on official business. Upon hearing the shocking news, he rushed back to his hometown to investigate and handle the aftermath, intending to take two steps. First, he will report the details of the disaster to the county government and request relief. In terms of personnel, it is necessary to wait for the water to recede before finding ways to collect the corpses and repair the dikes. (6th) Another dispatch: When the typhoon passed through, the river tide in Shazhou City, Sixing Port, and Nanfeng Town along the river in this county was affected by the hurricane and suddenly landed, with the water level rising to more than ten feet, causing hundreds of nearby residents to drown. The situation is very tragic. The Shazhou telephone has not yet been restored, and the details are still difficult to confirm, but as the water recedes, more than ninety corpses have been found and are being collected after being examined by the court. As for the losses this time, it is estimated that dozens of new and old dikes were destroyed, occupying about 3,000 mu of land, and the fields are full of soybeans, cotton, and other crops. All of these were destroyed this time. According to the statistics of the Shatian Company, the loss is more than 800,000 yuan. In addition, the Xinli, Houde, and Dingfeng three reclamation companies have built new dikes this year, and the project cost alone has been around 200,000 yuan. In addition, there are houses, livestock, etc., all of which were destroyed, and the losses are also quite considerable. Therefore, the total loss this time should be more than one million yuan. This year's sandy land cotton has been affected, and it is difficult to recover from this damage for a while.</p>

<p>Four Chinese Traitors Captured in Ben Niu</p>
<p>Pan Bingshu and other road protection police officers from the Ben Niu Town sub-station in Wujin County were patrolling near Ben Niu Railway Station in the late night of the 5th when they caught sight of four suspicious people. They saw them doing something on the tracks, and immediately moved forward to arrest them without making a sound. All four were captured. Upon searching them, they found a piece of paper with the words "Three Steps Two Bridges," five large and small photographs, a handful of soybeans, and a postal registered receipt. The traitors' attitude was extremely tough. The precinct judge held a preliminary hearing. According to their confession, they were named Zhang Yisheng, Chen Yusheng, Ge Hongkui, and Shen Changsheng. They had previously served as soldiers and had been out of work for a long time. The rest of their statements were evasive.

<p>Recently, the situation has been tense, and various industries have been affected.

<p>Since the death of Mr. Li Yanshi, disputes have arisen in the Wuxing Electric Company. In addition to reporting to the Construction Committee, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction sent a special commissioner, Chen Kui, to investigate the truth in Hu on the afternoon of the 4th. He first went to the Construction Section of this county to inquire about the cause of the disputes, and then went to the power plant outside the North Gate to talk to the workers separately. The previous night, the company's water pump suddenly encountered obstacles, and some of the machines could not be started, causing a power outage for three or four hours, which was suspected of being caused by sabotage. Commissioner Chen believed that this matter was related to local security and ordered the chief engineer of the plant to be responsible for handling it and to strictly prepare the power plant to prevent accidents. He stayed at the Central Hotel that night. He heard that on the morning of the 5th, he went to the company's Shouxian Bridge to check the accounts. In the afternoon, he returned to Hangzhou to report to the department.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>

The authorities are very concerned about the people's food supply and have commissioned the Rice Industry Association to conduct an investigation. The association has now prepared an investigation form and ordered various firms to report on the general situation of grain on a weekly basis.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>

<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Rivers Huai, Yi, and Shu Suddenly Rise</p>
<p>The Huai, Yi, and Shu rivers, which pass through various counties in northern Jiangsu, rose sharply by three to four meters starting at noon on the 3rd. The Shu River, Chaimi, and Liutang three rivers in Shuyi County have already reached the flood stage. The water level in the Shiji area of Siyang, which is subject to the flow of the Yi River from the Central Canal, has also risen sharply by about four meters. Therefore, Qi County Chief of Shuyang, Changlun Jie, and Chang Rong, County Chief of Siyang He, all sent telegrams on the 3rd to the Huaiyi Shu Water Conservancy Project Office and the Jiangbei Transportation Wang Bureau, reporting the sudden rise of the rivers and requesting defense methods. County Chief He of Siyang has also recruited more than 5,000 laborers and organized a large rescue engineering team. As for the Huai River flowing from Honghu, it enters the canal through the Zhangfu and Shunqing rivers. The water level at Qingjiang Lock has reached about two zhang and two chi. The Huaiyi Shu Water Conservancy Project Office and the Jiangbei Transportation Wang Bureau, in view of the sudden rise of river water in various places, have telegraphed to their respective departments to pay attention to embankment protection and rush to form rescue engineering teams to prepare for emergencies.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Requests Relief for Collapsing Riverbank</p>
<p>The riverbanks along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu, such as Liuyu in Guazhou, have repeatedly collapsed during the high flood season, inundating a large amount of fertile land over the years. The county magistrate of this county, Ma Zhenbang, believes that the Liuyu Riverbank is an important gateway for passengers traveling to and from Zhenjiang by car, and is of great importance to the safety of travelers. Therefore, after the Jiangkou collapsed by many zhang a month ago, he telegraphed the National Economic Commission and the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, appealing for rapid relief to protect the lives and fields of the coastal areas. It is learned that the above two institutions have replied to Yangzhou, stating that they will plan and implement it as soon as the research is completed.</p>
<p>Flood Relief in the Second and Third Districts</p>
<p>The Juban Township Zhongxing Town area in the third district of Jiangdu suffered a dike breach due to continuous wind and heavy rain, which caused the Yangtze River tide to surge. It was late at night, and residents who were sleeping were unable to escape and were swept away. It is estimated that the flooded area is three to four thousand mu, and most of the houses, livestock, and rations were swept away by the waves. The victims have now moved to higher ground and are crying for food. Township Chief Wang Zhongshi, in addition to rushing to handle temporary emergency accounts, has also surveyed the disaster situation and reported to the district to request County Magistrate Ma to find a way to provide relief. In addition, the banks of Tianchengzhou and Dunzizhou Nian three dikes have all broken, and the disaster situation is also tragic. The local Jiangfang Office has received orders from Fangxun Commissioner County Magistrate Ma by Jianju Affairs Section Chief Cao Rufu and technician Li Guishen to go to the second and third districts to work with local people to prevent and rescue. On the evening of the 5th, they first received 100 yuan in rescue funds, purchased 580 sacks and other rescue tools, and rushed to prevent and rescue.</p>
<p>Women's Association Telegraphed to Comfort Anti-Aggression Troops</p>

<h3>Yuyao</h3>
<p>Abandonment Case Released on Bail Pending Trial</p>
<p>Chen Bo-ying, a Yuyao native, once served as a professor at Jinling University. He was previously accused of abandonment for seducing female student Lu Yunzhen and failed to appear in court despite repeated summons. Chen was recently arrested by a bailiff in Zhouxing. The case was publicly heard on the morning of the 5th, and the audience was extremely crowded. Chen confessed that due to a momentary lapse of judgment, he forgot the teacher-student relationship. After cohabitation, he regularly remitted money for support and did not abandon her. He couldn't help but cry in court when the woman ungratefully filed a lawsuit. The hearing continued in the afternoon. The court investigated the remittance evidence before a retrial. Chen was released on bail with 700 yuan in cash.</p>

At about 10:00 am, when sailing to the Yixi Bridge outside the South Gate of this city, the ship was washed away by the water current when it just came out of the bridge hole due to the fast flow of water and the helmsman was careless, causing the ship to capsize. Later, it rushed to the opposite side of the Hehe Beach. More than 20 soldiers and crew members escaped by swimming, and the rest broke through the bottom of the ship to rescue themselves. However, a messenger soldier drowned tragically because he was inside the hull for a long time.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi, Gu Weijun Meet with French Finance Minister and U.S. Ambassador</h3>
<p>Discussing the Issuance of £20 Million Bonds; U.S. and France Agree to Have Banks Participate in Subscription</p>
<p>[Paris] The matter discussed yesterday by Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun with French Prime Minister Xu Dan was the issuance of £20 million in foreign debt that Kong had negotiated in London. Today, Kong and Gu held similar talks with U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt. It is said that once the situation in China is stable, the U.S., France, and Belgium may also participate in this foreign debt. (6th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] This morning, Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, accompanied by Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, visited French Prime Minister Xu Dan for a long talk. At noon, he attended a banquet hosted by U.S. Ambassador to France Berleitt, and in the evening, he met with French Finance Minister Lian Lai. In the evening, the Paris International Exposition Reception Committee hosted a banquet for Kong, chaired by the French Aviation Director Antro, and many dignitaries were invited to accompany him. Kong recently gave an interview to a Havas reporter, saying: "Prime Minister Xu Dan of your country and Ambassador Julieitt of the United States have both expressed sympathetic understanding to me, which is gratifying. Now I must visit your country's Finance Minister Ponglai and leave Paris on the evening of the 8th of this month. According to French sources, Deputy Prime Minister Kong recently negotiated in London in principle to issue foreign bonds of £20 million with Chinese customs revenue as collateral to exchange Chinese domestic bonds. France and the United States immediately agreed to have banks in the two countries subscribe to these bonds. At present, Kong is deeply concerned that banks in these countries may change their original intentions due to the events in the Far East, so he has come here to explain China's prospects to French Prime Minister Xu Dan and U.S. Ambassador Berleitt, so that they can rest assured, and so that future bond subscribers can also rest assured. Deputy Prime Minister Kong also stated that he believes that this effort will be completely successful." (6th Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>

This Diet unexpectedly had to submit a huge additional budget and special tax bill due to the North China Incident, and all the members were able to recognize the current major situation and promote the achievement of national unity, which is truly inspiring. The proposals and budget bills that have been supported by this Diet should be implemented in a suitable and effective manner, which goes without saying.

<h3>Japan-Russia Relations</h3>
<p>Sakhalin Oil Mines; Another Dispute Arises</p>
<p>[Moscow] After the robbery of the Soviet Consulate in Tianjin, a dispute arose between Japan and Russia over the Sakhalin oil mines, causing the relations between the two groups to become more tense. Regarding this matter, the Soviet government's organ newspaper News has recently published an article entitled "The Arrogant Behavior of the Japanese," stating: "The Sakhalin Japanese Petroleum Company recently decided to build an oil pipeline in the Gadangglei area of northeastern Sakhalin to the coast, saying that the Concession General Office under the Soviet People's Committee was slow to approve it and could not wait. This matter was known to the Soviet government, which considered it a serious violation of the concession contract, and immediately ordered the Sakhalin authorities to prohibit it. In addition, well-informed sources in Sukyo also said, "The Japanese company has repeatedly violated the concession contract this year. The Soviet government is now taking all necessary measures to urge it to abide by the contract and Soviet law." (6th Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>U.S.-Russia Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Agreed to Extend for One Year</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt announced today that the U.S.-Russia Special Commercial Agreement has now been decided to be extended for one year, but the minimum amount of goods purchased by Soviet Russia from the United States should be increased from 10 million yuan last year to 40 million yuan. The United States will grant Soviet Russia reciprocal trade rights. According to the State Department, the United States purchased approximately 37 million yuan of U.S. goods last year.

This exchange of documents was approved and announced by the Soviet People's Committee and U.S. President Roosevelt on the 6th and took effect immediately. (6th Tass Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Time for British-Italian Negotiations is Ripe</h3>
<p>To Be Held in Rome in September</p>
<p>[London] The time for British-Italian diplomatic talks is ripe and will begin in Rome at the end of September. The British side will be represented by Sir Drummond, the British Ambassador to Italy. (7th Central News Agency Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Rome] The British Ambassador, Sir Drummond, set off for home at 11:00 am today for a holiday. (7th Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Rome] It is said that the United Kingdom and Italy have already reached a general understanding, so the British-Italian negotiations seem likely to reopen next week. At that time, the British Ambassador to Italy will have returned to London to discuss with the British Foreign Office, while the Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom will also return to his country for the same purpose. However, well-informed sources here still hold the view that the easing of British-Italian tension is only psychological in nature. A considerable amount of time must pass before an agreement is reached. The general view is that the negotiations will not be concluded by the time of the next League of Nations meeting. (7th National Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the good news that the United Kingdom and Italy have released their suspicions, the left-wing "Paris Echo" recently commented: "There is one thing to be noted here, that is, the Italian Ambassador Cerutti visited the French Prime Minister Xu Dan and told him that after the United Kingdom and Italy approached, France and Italy would also approach. Regarding this point, we can declare one thing to Italy, that is, its goodwill will inevitably arouse the same reaction in our country, but there are several matters that must be clarified, namely: ㊀ The issue of the withdrawal of Italian troops stationed in the Spanish Balearic Islands, ㊁ The issue of freedom of transportation in the Mediterranean Sea for the United Kingdom and France, ㊂ The issue of the implementation of various clauses in the Treaty of Friendship between France and Italy signed in January 1935 regarding French Tunis. Regarding the Abyssinian issue, French Foreign Minister Talbos and British Foreign Secretary Eden failed to persuade the countries to recognize the Italian annexation last September, but this year they may try to have the League of Nations recognize the power of Abyssinian Emperor Selassie. Now that he no longer exists, he is not allowed to continue attending the conference. If the Italian government submits a motion at that time, requesting the conference to revoke the resolution announcing the Italian aggression on October 7, 1935, it will inevitably cause unlimited disputes."

<h3>Expansion of the Military Medical System in Japan</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Due to the needs of future wars for a larger number of military doctors, the Army authorities are revising the Ministry of Health's officer regulations promulgated in Showa 8. They are shortening the training period for military medical officer candidates and training sergeants to one month. They are also changing the period of service for second lieutenants to two years, in order to facilitate their early engagement in practical work. (7th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Palestinian Partition Issue</h3>
<p>Jewish National Congress: No Resolution Yet</p>
<p>⊙Zurich Today, during the Jewish program, the Zionist Congress has not held a meeting. The Congress has not yet reached a resolution on the partition plan for Palestine. Dr. Chaim Weizmann will go to Geneva at the end of the week to report to the League of Nations Mandate Commission on the sentiment of the majority of attendees at the Congress regarding the partition issue. According to Jewish Telegraphic Agency news, if the Congress delegates vote, approximately 75% will support the proposal passed yesterday by the Labor Group, authorizing the Executive Committee to negotiate with Britain regarding the partition proposal in order to comply with all resolutions. Zionist leader from America, Mr. Lipsky, stated that he believes the American delegation will vote in favor of Dr. Weizmann's resolution. He believes that only about 10% of the delegates support the extreme demand of rejecting partition in any form. Palestinian Labor leader Rubashov stated that the partition proposal contains the core of resolving the Jewish-Arab problem and it is now urgent to carefully study the Palestine Mandate Commission's recommendations. According to Weizmann's resolution, it authorizes the Executive Committee to negotiate with the British government regarding the partition issue, but only if the plan contains fundamental principles that allow Jews in Palestine to enjoy the life of an independent state as they envision, and thereby solve the Jewish problem in various countries. (Central News Agency, 6th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Zurich The Zionist Congress is continuing to convene here. Labor Party leader Le Mesurier of Palestine delivered his opinion, attacking the British Committee's proposal to divide Palestine into three zones, saying that it would reduce the rights that the Jewish people should enjoy under the mandate system and international obligations. Rubashov, the Labor Party leader of Tel Aviv, advocated accepting the British plan, saying that this may be the only opportunity to establish a Jewish state and should not be missed. Finally, Zionist leader Weizmann declared that the British plan must be improved, and most importantly, the Jewish people should have complete sovereignty over the Jewish part of the holy city of Jerusalem. (Central News Agency, 6th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] French Ambassador Corbin recently submitted a note regarding the Palestinian issue to the Foreign Office, which has now been forwarded to the Colonial Office for review. The French note expresses concern about several measures in the Palestine partition plan, believing that they could cause harm. One of the most opposed points is the report's suggestion to establish an Arab National Affairs Office in London and within Palestine to handle all matters related to the Arab people worldwide, similar to the existing Jewish Affairs Office. If this organization is established, agitators from French mandated territories, such as Syria and French territories in North Africa, may be accommodated within the office, thereby intensifying their activities and inevitably causing harm. (Central News Agency, 6th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Mandate Commission is continuing its meeting to discuss the Palestine issue. Mr. Hall, the representative of the British administrative authorities in Palestine, discussed the issue of foreign intervention in internal disputes in Palestine, which was raised by the Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Orts, yesterday. He said that after the conflicts between Jews and Arabs in Palestine last year, the authorities of various Arab countries came forward to mediate. Their motives were purely humanitarian, but Britain has not accepted any constraints on the solutions proposed by these parties. Its actions remain entirely independent. The issue of Palestine has exceeded the local scope in recent months, as can be seen in the note submitted by the government of Iraq. However, member states of the League of Nations often express opinions on issues that do not concern them, so Iraq's submission of a note is justified. (Central News Agency, 6th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Home Office Expels German Journalists</h3>
<p>[London] Krom and Riedel, reporters for the Berlin 'Local Guide Newspaper' stationed in London, and Langen, a reporter for the Berlin 'Graver Newspaper', have been ordered by the British Home Office to be expelled from the country and must leave Britain within fifteen days. Regarding this matter, the Liberal Party's 'News Chronicle' reports that these individuals are being expelled on suspicion of espionage. (Central News Agency, 7th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the expulsion of Krom and Riedel, reporters for the Berlin 'Local Guide Newspaper' stationed in London, and Langen, a reporter for the Berlin 'Graver Newspaper', the German Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, Mr. Wallerman, is said to be preparing to lodge a protest with the British government in the near future. As for the reasons for the expulsion of these reporters, it is said that it was due to espionage activities. In reality, the main reason is that these reporters engaged in anti-British propaganda, especially the writings of Langen every week, which were the most intense. The British government once warned him. In 1935, Dr. Victor de, the London correspondent for the German Nazi Party's organ newspaper, the Attack Newspaper, and the People's Observer, applied to the British Home Office for renewal of his press credentials after his license expired. The department then refused on the grounds of violating public interest. The department's order yesterday to expel Krom and the other three is the second time it has imposed sanctions.

<h3>Americans Enlisting in China</h3>
<p>Suma Asks the U.S. to Pay Attention; Hull Says He Will Handle It According to Law</p>
<p>[Washington] Suma, the counselor of the Japanese Embassy in the United States, visited U.S. Secretary of State Hull today regarding the issue of Americans enlisting in China to participate in the anti-Japanese war, urging attention, but did not lodge a protest. Hull then announced to the press corps that the U.S. government will handle the matter of its citizens participating in foreign wars according to law. However, it is generally believed that this matter is difficult to prove, so reports are also uncommon. For example, many Americans enlisted in the Spanish Civil War, but none have been prosecuted by the authorities according to law. (6th National News dispatch)</p>
<p>[Washington] Foreign reports say that several thousand Americans have decided to enlist in the Chinese Air Force. The State Department has announced that it is unaware of this matter. Well-informed sources say that according to current U.S. law, Americans are not allowed to voluntarily enlist in foreign armies within the United States, but they are free to leave the country and go to China to enlist. Recently, Americans who volunteered to go to Spain have returned to the United States and have never been sentenced. This can be taken as clear evidence. (Central News Agency, 6th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull announced today that the law prohibiting Americans from enlisting in foreign countries will apply to the Sino-Japanese conflict. According to this law, violators will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to three years and fined $2,000. As far as the State Department is aware, the United States has never initiated a prosecution based on this law. If there is any action, it will be taken by the Department of Justice. This law has never been implemented for a hundred years. (Central News Agency, 6th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[Washington] Senator Lewis today introduced a bill in the Senate to accelerate the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, asking Secretary of War Woodring to report to the Senate on the reasons why the U.S. 15th Infantry Regiment is still stationed in Tianjin. (6th National News dispatch)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Aircraft Bomb British, French, and Italian Merchant Ships</h3>
<p>Italian Captain Dies of Serious Injuries; Britain Lodges a Serious Protest</p>
<p>[London] The three aircraft that bombed merchant ships of Britain, France, Italy, and other countries off the coast of Algiers yesterday have been confirmed to be aircraft of the Spanish Nationalist forces. Britain has lodged a serious protest with the Nationalist authorities on Mallorca. At the same time, maritime powers have instructed their respective merchant ships not to enter the accident site without naval protection. Since this incident, the capitals of European countries have been shocked. The person who lodged a protest with the Spanish Nationalist forces today was Rear Admiral Wells, commander of the British Third Fleet. After the British, French, and Italian ships were attacked, it is said that the French suffered very minor losses. Nationalist aircraft made low-altitude flights and strafed downwards with machine guns. The ship's deck was hit by about a hundred bullets, but there were no deaths or injuries. However, the captain of the Italian ship Mongolia was seriously injured. The British ship also suffered only minor losses and there were no deaths or injuries. However, the attacking aircraft continuously attacked for an hour, dropping more than 40 bombs, none of which hit. They also strafed downwards with machine guns, and the ship was hit by many bullets. It was fortunate that it escaped danger. (Central News Agency, 7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Algiers The captain of the Italian ship 'Mongolia', Mr. Solarari, who was seriously injured in the lungs during the attack in this port yesterday, has died. The Dutch inspector, Mr. Bairu Yi, who had a fractured arm, is not in serious condition. (Central News Agency, 7th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Algeciras Three ships, one each from Britain, France, and Italy, were attacked yesterday in Spanish waters. Among them, the British cargo ship 'Cowper Lyle' was bombed by three aircraft 35 nautical miles outside this port, a total of 40 bombs were dropped, but none hit. The captain immediately ordered 'full sail', but the aircraft still flew at low altitude and strafed with machine guns for an hour. The Italian ship 'Mongolia' was hit by a bomb at 6:05 yesterday morning. A major, a Dutch inspector sent by the London Adjustment Committee, had his right arm broken. A crew member had his right lung punctured and has landed at the French port of Algiers and been sent to a hospital for treatment. In addition, the French cargo ship 'Jebé Yemou' was attacked by aircraft once five weeks ago. Yesterday, it was strafed by a single aircraft with machine guns, firing about a hundred bullets, none of which hit. Those that fell on the deck have been handed over to experts for inspection. After the news of the incident reached the port of Algiers, all parties were shocked. The Seamen's Union of the port declared that it would refuse to go to Spanish waters until the safety of the crew is guaranteed. (Central News Agency, 7th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Army Recruitment Below Target</h3>
<p>Secretary of War Cancels Leave and Returns to London to Discuss Remedial Measures</p>
<p>[London] Secretary of War Hore-Belisha, who was on leave, has canceled his leave and hurriedly returned to London because the number of recruits for both the active army and the reserve army is below target. He is preparing to consult with senior army officers to find remedial measures. The current authorized strength of the active army and the reserve army is 112,000 less than in 1914. Looking only at the active army, 47,000 new soldiers need to be recruited this year to reach the target. (Central News Agency, 7th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Spanish Problem Still Deadlocked</h3>
<p>Russia, Germany, Italy, and Portugal Hold Opposing Views; Chairman Asks the Chief of Supervision to Report</p>
<p>[London] The effort to break the deadlock of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War has failed again. The subcommittee met for an hour today but failed to reconcile the differences between the Soviet Union and Italy and Germany. The committee must wait for its secretary to convene another meeting. Today, Lord Plymouth, seeing that no result could be obtained, announced the adjournment of the meeting. This move is intended to allow each committee member to calmly consult with their own government to determine whether a compromise can be reached, rather than admitting that another deadlock has occurred. At the same time, the technical committee will proceed with uncontroversial matters. Another technical committee has been formed to study land and sea supervision matters. During today's meeting, Soviet representative Maisky stated that the Soviet government cannot change its opinion expressed at the last meeting opposing the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist forces' right to belligerent status. The German representative asked to note that the German government is deeply concerned about the continuation of unilateral supervision, which obviously cannot continue for long. The chairman said that it would be more beneficial to consider the issue after the report from Major General Van Tume, the head of the land and sea supervision plan office, and Secretary Hemming on the investigation of supervision matters is submitted to the meeting, if it is necessary to consider the problem. He expressed sympathy. Maisky asked the German and Portuguese representatives whether they were prepared to declare their governments' unconditional agreement to the withdrawal of volunteers. The Soviet representative was not satisfied with the answers of the three countries' representatives. Maisky argued that the issue of volunteers is at the heart of the British plan. He must obtain an answer and also stated that the Soviet Union opposes granting belligerent rights, at least until after all volunteers have been withdrawn. Thereupon, the representatives of Germany, Italy, and Portugal all said that Maisky's remarks were irrelevant to the matter under discussion and outside the scope of the British plan, and that the three countries had accepted the British plan in principle, while the Soviet Union had not. Plymouth somewhat agreed with the representatives of Germany, Italy, and Portugal that what was being discussed was the British plan, not the Soviet plan for the withdrawal of volunteers, and proposed that the Land and Sea Supervision Plan Office should report on its inspection and put forward suggestions for restoring and improving the supervision plan, which was unanimously approved by the full meeting. Thereupon, the secretary of the office reported to the meeting that several governments had not yet paid the expenses that should be paid in accordance with the non-interference plan. The attending representatives promised to notify their respective governments of this matter and ask them to pay immediately. (Central News Agency, 6th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>American Woman Gives Birth Post Mortem Via Surgery</h3>
<p>Surprisingly Obtains a Lively Girl; Raises Legal and Ethical Issues</p>
<p>⊙Philadelphia, USA A bizarre birth case occurred here today. Doctors performed surgery on a woman after her death and surprisingly obtained a living infant. This has raised complex legal and ethical issues. A Mrs. Barkosheni, 27 years old, suffered from tuberculous meningitis and died at 3:15 a.m. today. Obstetrician Dr. Gobit was beside her for several hours, then rapidly performed a dissection. Sixty seconds later, he surprisingly extracted a girl from the dead body. The court ruled today that a dissection could be performed after the mother's death. The mother's husband no longer insists that the infant must die with the mother, but yesterday he strongly opposed the surgery. He later changed his mind. Doctors and nurses began surgery eight minutes after the mother's death. Fortunately, the mother's blood was still circulating, saving the infant in the abdomen. There is no precedent for this case. The hospital is consulting with legal experts to study the responsibility of sacrificing the mother to save the infant. Judge Garonan declared that if the mother's heart has stopped beating for one minute, performing surgery is legal. According to doctors, if surgery is performed within a few minutes after the mother's death, the infant still has a chance of survival. (6th National News dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany Greatly Disappointed by the Large Trade Deficit With Manchukuo</h3>
<p>Berlin Trade figures between Germany and "Manchukuo" have always been listed under trade between China and Germany. Now, German officials have announced trade figures between the country and "Manchukuo" for the first half of the year, which has been opened in a separate column outside of trade between the two countries of China. According to this figure, Germany purchased goods worth 32,000,000 marks, and "Manchukuo" purchased goods worth 4,000,000 marks. Compared with the two, Germany has a trade deficit of 28,000,000 marks. Regarding this level, German business people originally thought that after the German-Manchukuo trade agreement (produced on May 1, 1936) was established, Germany's exports to "Manchukuo" would greatly increase, and at least the trade figures between the two parties would increase equally. The result was the opposite, and no one was disappointed. (Central News Agency, 7th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Undecided on Entering Nanjing; No Statement Released; Difficult to Start Negotiations Due to Japanese Troops Pressing the Border</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to China Shigeru Kawagoe, returning to his post in China, arrived in Shanghai on June 29. He once went to Nanjing, and then left Shanghai to go north on the 8th of last month. He was detained in Tianjin by the local Japanese garrison authorities, lingering in Tianjin for a month. It was not until recently that he and Chinese Counselor Shimizu and Secretary Hoshida traveled from Tianjin to Dalian and took the Dalian Steamship Company's Qingdao Maru, returning south to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock. The ship docked at the Yangshupu Huangpu Wharf. The Consul General Okamoto in Shanghai, Consuls Yoshioka, Tajiri, the Information Minister of the Embassy, ​​Secretary General Zomi, Commerce Official Iwai, Army Attache Kita, Naval Attache Honda, and Zhou Jue, Secretary of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Chen Ming, Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, went to meet him. After landing, he drove directly to the official residence on Bishun Road to rest. At 6 o'clock, he summoned Okamoto, Tajiri, Shimizu, Zomi, etc. to hold a meeting to describe his meeting with the local garrison authorities in Tianjin. He listened to Okamoto and others' reports on the situation in Nanjing and Shanghai, and discussed the matter. At first, when Kawagoe arrived, reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers met him at the wharf. Kawagoe refused to make a statement because he was unprepared. Our reporters' group raised a few points in writing and asked for a reply. Kawagoe instructed Shimizu to arrange to reply to the reporters at 6:30 that night. When the reporters went to his official residence on time, Shimizu again declined to meet them on the grounds that he had no time to meet. At this time when the clouds of war are permeating, a peaceful atmosphere suddenly emerges. The actions of this national diplomatic representative are particularly watched by the public. However, Kawagoe once claimed that whether he would immediately enter Nanjing has not yet been decided. Kawagoe also observes the recklessness of the soldiers of that country. At the same time, it is difficult to start diplomatic negotiations with our country under the pressure of the large army of that country. For the time being, we can only stay in Shanghai to observe the development of the situation.</p>
<p>The Allied News Agency reported on the 7th that Ambassador Kawagoe, who arrived in Shanghai today, released a statement at 10 p.m. as follows: The Sino-Japanese situation is becoming more serious and subtle, and its objective situation is gradually moving towards a crisis, which is developing quite a lot. This is the current situation I observed. I firmly want to make the final effort and attempt to solve it by diplomatic means.

<h3>Central Committee Member Xiao Zhenying Talks About the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Only by Launching a Full-Scale War of Resistance; Going to Nanjing This Morning to Meet Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Central Committee member Xiao Zhenying returned to China on the 6th and arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, at his private residence on Massenet Road, he met with Wu Huanzhang, Wang Ziyao, and many others, and went out to visit friends. It was originally scheduled to take the night train to Nanjing at 11 o'clock that evening with Go Dingyuan, Counselor of the Executive Yuan, Li Shijun, Director of the 29th Army's Office in Nanjing, Li Guang'an, Director of the Office in Shanghai, and Wu Huanzhang, a member of the Legislative Yuan. Later, because things were not finished, it was changed to take the capital express train to Nanjing at 8 o'clock today. Xiao is scheduled to meet Chairman Chiang and the central figures after arriving in Nanjing, and then go north to meet Song Zheyuan, Commander of the 29th Army. According to Xiao, he went to Europe and the United States to inspect, traversing Italy, England, France, Germany, Russia, the United States, and 21 other countries, and deeply felt that each country has its own advantages and strengths. It is a pity that there was not enough time to investigate further. When I was in the Soviet Union, I learned that the situation in North China was critical. When I arrived in Poland, it was confirmed that the Lugouqiao Incident had broken out, and I felt deeply saddened. Then I decided to return to China. When I arrived in England, I received a telegram from Nanjing calling me back, so I hurried back from the United States. In the face of the current situation, only by launching a full-scale war of resistance can the nation survive. This is not enough to say my own opinion, but it is the unanimous request of the whole country. As for the result of the war of resistance, we don't have to consider its success or failure. At the very least, it will inevitably lead to mutual destruction. Division Commander Zhao Dengyu was unusually loyal and brave on weekdays, always leading the troops in every battle, and he especially valued the concept of the country. This time, he died for the country in the war of resistance. Division Commander Zhao and I have been friends for 20 years. On the one hand, I am sad for him, and on the other hand, I deeply feel that the glorious death of my old friend can be said to be a death worthy of his place. Xiao finished speaking and wept, and the reporter also felt sad, so he said goodbye and left.</p>
<h3>Overflowing Throughout China's Territory: A United Spirit to Resist the Enemy</h3>
<p>Border Residents Voluntarily Exert Efforts to Kill the Enemy; Youths Think of Using Blood to Wash Away Shame; The People of Kang and Tibet</p>
<p>The People of Kang and Tibet</p>
<p>Ms. Liu Manqing, the current Section Chief of the State Council's Secretariat, is an outstanding talent from Xikang. She twice represented the government in 1929 and 1933, traveling swiftly to Kang and Tibet to communicate with the Dalai Lama and others, achieving considerable success. Ms. Liu came to Shanghai yesterday afternoon on official business. A reporter from the Dagong News Agency, considering the recent movements of our border regions after the Sino-Japanese Incident to be a point that cannot be ignored, specifically visited her residence. According to her, the people of Kang and Tibet have gradually strengthened their faith in the central government in recent years. After the outbreak of the North China Incident, local natives, driven by patriotism, suddenly became tense. Young men and strong adults all voluntarily rose up to organize volunteer teams to be ready to be loyal to the country at any time and exert efforts to resist the enemy. The elderly, women, and children pray with incense every day, hoping to eliminate disasters for the country. Although whether such actions are appropriate is certainly questionable, their patriotic zeal is undiminished. In short, the spirit of defending the country and resisting the enemy has spread throughout the entire Chinese territory, which is deeply gratifying. Ms. Liu finally said that there are about two hundred Kang and Tibetan people currently serving in the capital. They have already begun concrete organization. If, unfortunately, the war extends to the capital, all Kang and Tibetan people vow to die with the city and will never seek to escape.</p>

In the future, the work will be divided into rescue and military teams. After a general assembly of all members is held in Shanghai within days, they will depart north, attempting to use the hot blood of youth to cleanse the shame of being invaded by the enemy. The corps also issued an appeal to the national public yesterday, with particularly indignant words.</p>

<h3>Du Yuesheng Gives Broadcast Speech Yesterday to Raise National Salvation Donations</h3>
<p>Economic War of Resistance Stands on the Front Lines; Destroying Homes to Relieve the National Crisis Are Both Heroes on the Battlefield</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng gave a broadcast speech on the radio station of the Ministry of Communications yesterday to raise national salvation donations. The topic was 'Please Compatriots Help the Government with Real Strength'. The original text is as follows: "Fellow compatriots, you all understand very well that the newspapers these past few days have clearly told us that the country has reached a critical juncture of life and death, which means that all compatriots across the country have reached a critical juncture of life and death. From the 'September 18th Incident' until now, seven years have passed in a flash. During these seven years, we have been subjected to the oppression of the enemy. We have often endured hardship and worked hard while waiting for the world's fair opinion. However, the ambition of the aggressors has not diminished for the sake of world opinion but has become even more intense. It is not enough to plunder eastern Hebei and northern Chahar; now they have even crossed into the entire North China. If we continue to tolerate it, then they will definitely take another step and annex our entire China. Fellow compatriots, the country has now reached a critical juncture of life and death. We must quickly unite to save the country, which is to save ourselves. The Lugouqiao Incident is being watched by people all over the world and criticized by the press in various countries. Spain and China, on opposite sides of the globe, are staging a tragic play. Although China has suffered a great humiliation, Japan's large-scale bombing of non-war zone cities and towns in China and the massacre of defenseless people in China have completely exposed its wild nature. The tragic situation of the North China compatriots who have been robbed this time, as disclosed in the newspapers, is probably less than one-ten-thousandth of the truth. Thousands of miles of scorched earth, the flesh and blood of tens of thousands of soldiers, and millions of displaced compatriots are all facts, and these facts will be left to the world's fair opinion. Fellow compatriots, but we must not have a dependent mentality and hope for help from others. Saving the country completely depends on our own strength. If we do not work hard, then the compatriots in North China who have suffered can be regarded as our predecessors. The enemy's invasion has no end, and now we are forced to retreat with no way out. I have explained in detail above that the ancients had a saying, 'Even a trapped beast will fight,' which means that when a wild beast is forced to have no way to retreat, it will still fight with others regardless of everything. Is our courage even inferior to that of a wild beast? But I want to announce to the people of the world that we are definitely not a nation that likes to fight. We are originally a people who love peace. We are willing to seek peace in equality and mutual benefit. We were not quick to sacrifice, but we were forced to resist. We are resisting for self-preservation. Until now, our people are still abiding by the government's consistent position. We are responding to war, not seeking war. Fellow compatriots, now that the country has reached a critical juncture of life and death, everything must not be taken into consideration, because it is a critical juncture of life and death for the entire nation. Only by uniting the strength of the entire nation can we resist. The strength of the people should be provided to the country. Those with strength should contribute strength, and those with money should contribute money. The strength of the people and the strength of the government must be united as one. This is what constitutes a sound country. You must understand that the lives and property of the people can only be protected by the state. If we look at the history of various subjugated countries, no people can preserve their lives and property after the country is subjugated. Let's take the history of the fall of the Ming Dynasty in our country. When Li Zicheng besieged Beijing, Emperor Chongzhen convened a meeting of ministers and asked them to find ways to donate money to relieve the national crisis, but none of them could do anything. Later, when Li Zicheng captured Beijing, he clamped all the rich people in Beijing with boards one by one. All the property of officials and people in Beijing was taken away by Li Zicheng without leaving anything behind. Almost everyone in the country knows this part of the history of the late Ming Dynasty. Everyone wants to protect his children and grandchildren, and everyone wants to cherish his property. Only by destroying homes to relieve the national crisis can we preserve the country. Otherwise, we may not be able to avoid being the people in Beijing during the late Ming Dynasty. If we cannot actively help the country now, the result is no different from leaving our property to the enemy's military needs. I don't think there is a patriotic compatriot who would want to be a person in Beijing during the late Ming Dynasty who was clamped and went bankrupt. With the same sacrifice of all property, we still have to leave a legacy of infamy for thousands of years. Moreover, modern warfare must have many conditions. The importance of airplanes, artillery, food, and medicine is generally known. In fact, the economy is more important than everything else. The victory in the European War depended on the economy. The United States did not participate in fierce warfare during the European War, but it defeated Germany entirely on its economic strength. This is the best example. Now that the science of warfare is becoming more advanced, the effectiveness of the economy is becoming greater. The victory or defeat of a war between two countries can be determined in advance based on economic measures. In ordinary times, we are constantly at war in industry and commerce. It is precisely because we neglected the economic war in the past that we were underestimated by the enemy, which led to today's national crisis. Past mistakes can only be left to be corrected in the future. Now, everyone must destroy their homes to relieve the national crisis and be a backing for the government. You must understand that those who cut down generals and seize flags on the front lines are indeed heroes who defend the country, and those who destroy their homes to relieve the national crisis in the rear are also heroes who defend the country. The survival or extinction of the Chinese nation depends on the expression of the strength of the masses this time."</p>
<p>"Fellow compatriots, everyone must understand that the spiritual war between the people of the two countries had already begun long before the outbreak of the overall war of resistance. Our compatriots across the country are running around calling for the raising of national salvation donations. The people on the other side are also holding donation drives in their country. Our donations are used to resist power, and their donations are used for aggression. If their people do not donate, they can preserve their international credibility and the unnecessary sacrifices of soldiers. However, our donations are for preserving the survival of the Chinese nation and for maintaining the state of the Republic of China. The nature of the donations from the two countries is completely opposite. Their people do not have to donate to the government, but our people must donate to the government. As usual, our donations must be more enthusiastic than theirs. If it can really be as I said, that we are certainly enthusiastic, then our spiritual war and economic war will be won. If the economic war can be won, then the military war can be guaranteed. Everyone, we are really standing on the front lines in the war of resistance to save the country. In the sense of this donation, we are very dominant. Everything depends on everyone's efforts. Let's first overwhelm the enemy in terms of the amount of donations, which is the success of our first battle in the voice of resistance. If we can achieve our hope, we must work harder. In fact, we are not only seeking to overwhelm the enemy once, even if we win. The most important thing is to be able to persevere in the struggle. The most shameful thing for us is that we are often criticized for only having five minutes of enthusiasm. Everyone, hurry up and use facts to cancel this criticism. We all know that national salvation donations are truly the basic work of revitalizing the national state. Everyone must have a spirit of permanent persistence and do it consistently. Even when the national crisis is lifted, we must continue to donate because in any undertaking, any struggle, whoever can persevere, whoever can achieve the final victory. What I have said today is really not to say how concise and thorough it is, but just to express some of my personal opinions. Fortunately, we don't need to say much, but focus on doing it earnestly. I hope that all compatriots across the country will work together and hurry up to do it. That's all."</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Returning from the United States Raise Money to Save the Country</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese in the United States love their motherland and have never lagged behind others. In the past, they have always contributed as much as possible to various charitable donations. This time, after the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the compatriots in various cities in the United States have organized anti-enemy support associations and have successively collected funds to remit back to the motherland. When the Empress of Asia arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 7th), dozens of overseas Chinese returning to the country, initiated by Yu Shi and others, held a temporary national salvation donation drive and raised a total of 324 yuan, 3 jiao, and 1 fen in national currency, which was handed over to the Shanghai All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association Fundraising Committee for submission to the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government.</p>
<h3>Two Compatriot Associations Meet to Handle Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>Danyang　The Danyang Shanghai Compatriots Association at No. 14, Fangxie Road, convened an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors at its clubhouse at 8:00 PM on the 6th. More than 30 people, including Pei Yuanding, attended. The chairman reported on the situation of attending the Shanghai Relief Committee's symposium of compatriot organizations, saying that the association should engage in relief preparations and, at a minimum, restore the spirit of the January 28th relief efforts. The points indicated by the Relief Committee were then discussed, and detailed decisions were made. Standing director Han Jingqi and others were also appointed to reside in the Relief Committee to assist in handling matters. It was also resolved to investigate the accurate addresses and skills of compatriots living in Shanghai within one week for statistics and to discuss the collection of national salvation donations and scrap metal, among other important cases.</p>
<p>Five Counties　About 100,000 compatriots from the five counties of Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, and Qi who are living in Shanghai have recently returned to their hometowns one after another due to the serious national crisis. However, the original ships are either in dock for repairs or have changed course due to official business, causing cargo to be congested. Those waiting for ships at the port are crowded. The association has held emergency meetings for days and decided to shorten the voyage. Except for the Tongyang route, which will operate as usual, the Shensha route ships will, from today onwards, go directly to Haihong, Niugang, and Lingdian ports, without stopping at other ports. In this way, time can be saved, and passengers can arrive earlier. Waiting for the ship to depart at any time. After the measures were agreed upon, the association pushed Gu Nanqun, Shen Xibin, Zhu Yisan, and Huang Jiping to contact separately and telegraphed the county chiefs of Chonghai and Qi to handle matters properly. In addition, the association temporarily added four groups—general affairs, fundraising, hygiene, and supply—to handle refugee relief matters, which is extremely busy.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Establishes Legal Consultation Office</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs previously established the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center, which has been actively working for several months and has achieved results in areas such as relief for those out of school, bank investigations, unemployment relief, and employment guidance. In order to facilitate inquiries about legal issues from all circles, the Shanghai Legal Consultation Office has been specially established, and Cui Sizhi has been appointed as the director to preside over everything. According to Cui, the office's general office has been set up at No. 45, Avenue Emile Zola, and several branch offices have been set up in densely populated areas. As for the inquiry method, it is as simple as possible. Anyone who has questions about the law can inquire by letter, telephone, or in person at the office, and the office will introduce the consultant lawyer to inquire face to face. If the inquired matter must go through litigation and the person is extremely poor, the office will hire a pro bono lawyer for them. The office is a government agency and is completely obligated for everything without taking any fees. The internal staff and major policies have been decided, and they will all be concurrently held by personnel from the Social Bureau or the Vocational Guidance Center. It is heard that the hired consultants include lawyers such as Guo Wei, Wang Liwu, and Yin Tinghua.</p>

<h3>Review of the Public Performance of 'Defend Lugou Bridge'</h3>
<p>— Li Wen</p>
<p>㊀ The Script</p>
<p>The enemy's artillery fire at the Lugou Bridge stirred the hearts of every Chinese compatriot unwilling to be a slave! The highest military leader expressed with iron determination to the national populace: the final moment has arrived, there is only resistance to the end! This excited and strengthened the will and awareness of every Chinese compatriot unwilling to be a slave!</p>
<p>China, you are roaring!</p>
<p>Standing at the forefront of national defense culture, the Shanghai theater community first mobilized a broad group of playwrights and actors, to create the most incisive national defense play—Defend Lugou Bridge!—through collective creation, completing the script, and very quickly staging it at the Penglai Grand Theater with the joint participation of various theater troupes.</p>
<p>Yes, we must defend Lugou Bridge! Recover lost territory!</p>
<p>The script is composed of three parts, each of which can be performed independently. A total of twenty-six people participated in the creative process. This is an unprecedented event in our country's theater community!</p>
<p>Indeed, judging from a purely artistic point of view, there are many aspects of this script that would not suit the tastes of some high-class gentlemen. For example, it completely lacks 'subtlety'! It's 'too sharp', and as a result, although the concession is our land, it cannot be performed within the concession, and it is limited to a corner of the Penglai Theater in the city. However, precisely because of this, it is an explosive thrown into the depths of the populace, violently stimulating every audience member's nerves, boiling their blood, so that everyone rises up and rushes towards the enemy!</p>
<p>Judging from the script, the most stimulating part of the whole play is the second part, which is almost an exchange of blood and tears, congealing into a picture of life-and-death struggle. One has this feeling simply from reading the script. Here, the loyalty and courage of soldiers and lower-level officers in serving the country, the ugly state of upper-level bureaucrats surrendering and begging for peace, the solidarity of the broad masses of people and soldiers in swearing to kill the enemy for the survival of the nation, many complex truths are revealed in the most exciting scenes and techniques. The second best is the first part, which reflects 'the eve of the storm' from a peaceful rural village, with emotions gradually rising, but perhaps because it had to consider the connection with the second part later, it concludes with the appearance of Chinese soldiers, and the originally raised climax—the rampages of the Japanese devils—suddenly turns in another direction, not giving people greater stimulation. The third part is somewhat weaker, the development of the play is not tight enough. Whether using this kind of scene to depict national resistance is the best method seems to be debatable. The play lacks depth, which is its shortcoming.</p>
<p>Such is my understanding of the script, but the effect on stage is not entirely the same as what one gets from reading the script.</p>
<p>(二) The Performance　　Tai Sheng</p>
<p>In an atmosphere of madness, excitement, and fervor, it can be said that not a single scene of the three-act play failed to firmly grip the audience. We heard the roars on stage, and we also heard the roars from the audience. This kind of madly fervent emotion fully expressed the Chinese people's determination to demand resistance!</p>
<p>The first part, "The Eve of the Storm"—in that teahouse, the Japanese soldiers' drill, ruining the beans and farmland of Lugou Bridge Village, and the men, women, and children being shot by the Japanese soldiers, I only want to point out two things in this scene, hoping for a change: (1) After the Japanese soldiers appear in the teahouse, they demolish the teahouse and whip Ding Datou. All the farmers just silently watch the Japanese soldiers' rage, and only after the Japanese soldiers leave does Liu Debiao, who shouted the loudest, shout again: "We want to go and kill the Japanese soldiers!" The audience actually laughed at this point. I think the script should be changed in this place, otherwise, the effect will be too bad; second, the effects of the Twenty-ninth Route Army's arrival, the soldiers' singing, bugle calls, war drums, etc., all seemed insufficiently fervent and tense.</p>
<p>The second part, "Lugou Bridge is Our Grave"—the script captures the current situation of "obeying orders" and "hesitating to decide" very well, but after the start of the war, the sound effects of gunshots, machine gun fire, hand grenade flames, etc., were too poor.</p>
<p>The third part, "National Resistance"—this should be the climax of the whole play. Although the positions of the actors are a bit chaotic, the effect obtained is very good because the emotions are very fervent. Especially during the shouting of "Defend Lugou Bridge" and the slogans of resistance, the entire theater was in a frenzy.</p>
<p>When Beiping, Tianjin, Lugou Bridge, and Wanping have completely fallen, and the overall resistance of the entire China is about to begin, the performance of "Defend Lugou Bridge" gave us an exciting stimulant.</p>
